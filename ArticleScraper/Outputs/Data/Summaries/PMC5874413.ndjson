{"summary": "PEDV is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus. it belongs to the genus Alphacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales (1). it is characterized by watery diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration in infected swine. EGFR activation suppresses endogenous airway epithelial antiviral signaling. inhibition of EGFR during hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection upregulates expression of interferon-stimulated genes and boosts antiviral efficacy of interferon. PEDV infection increases EGFR activation without affecting total EGFR expression. IPEC-J2, HEK293, and Vero E6 cells were incubated with PEDV at an MOI of 1 for 2 h at 4\u00b0C. UV-PEDV inactivation was verified by plaque assay. it is similar to the case with replication-competent PEDV. this suggests that PEDV replication is not required for the induction of EGFR activation in target cells. phosphorylation of EGFR was induced at 5 min and remained stable until 15 min in IPEC-J2 and HEK293 cells. levels of total EGFR had no obvious change over time. stimulation with EGF for 15 min was conducted to activate EGFR. the cells were infected with mock control or PEDV for 48 h or 24 h. total RNA was extracted from the cells, and PEDV RNA levels were assessed by quantitative RT-PCR using the primers listed in Table 1. total RNA was extracted from IPEC-J2 cells at 48 hpi (E) or from HEK293 cells at 24 hpi (D) and measured by TCID50 assay. cytotoxic effects of erlotinib and gefitinib were also confirmed. IPEC-J2 cells were pretreated with 10 M erlotinib or gefitinib for 12 h. the number of PEDV-positive cells was significantly lower in erlotinib- or gefitinib-treated IPEC-J2 cells than in a mock-treated control. the reduced titers of viruses in infected cell cultures were further analyzed and confirmed by measuring the TCID50 (Fig. 4E) IPEC-J2 and HEK293 cells were pretreated with DMSO or EGFR inhibitors, Erl and Gef, at 10 M for 12 h. cells were infected with PEDV or mock control in the absence or presence of inhibitors. at 24 h post-siRNA transfection, IPEC-J2 cells were inoculated with PEDV for an additional 48 h. EGFR-specific siRNA significantly decreased the levels of virus titers in HEK293 cells. depletion of endogenous EGFR expression enhances the antiviral response of type I interferon. the results are representative of three independent experiments (means and SD) PEDV infection links to the activation of STAT3. studies in cancer models suggest EGFR physically interacts with signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3). this leads to the phosphorylation of STAT3 and subsequent gene regulation. IPEC-J2 (A) and HEK293 (B) cells were incubated with PEDV at an MOI of 1 for 2 h at 4\u00b0C. unbound viruses were removed, and the cells were further incubated for different periods. a specific siRNA against STAT3 was introduced to knock down the endogenous expression of STAT3. a clear reduction of STAT3 mRNA and protein levels was observed in IPEC-J2 and HEK293 cells transfected with STAT3-specific siRNA. the reduced number of viruses in siRNA-transfected cells was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR. the effect of STAT3 knockdown on virus loads was determined by Western blotting. the levels of STAT3 protein and PEDV N protein were analyzed by Western blotting. the results are representative of three independent experiments (means and SD) IPEC-J2 and HEK293 cells were transfected with control siRNA or STAT3-specific siRNA for 24 h. the cells were then cultured in the presence of EGF for 15 min. this suggests that EGF induces rapid activation of STAT3. h followed by stimulation with 10 ng/ml EGF for 15 min. the cells were then infected with PEDV for an additional 48 h. unbound viruses were removed with PBS, and the cells were then cultured at 37\u00b0C for different times as indicated. detergent lysates collected from the cells were directly subjected to reducing SDS-PAGE and blotted with MAbs against phospho-EGFR (pEGFR), EGFR, and -actin. coronavirus spike (S) protein attaches to the cellular receptor to mediate viral entry (35, 36); therefore, we examined the interaction between PEDV S protein and EGFR using a coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) assay in HEK293 cells. PEDV induces EGFR activation at the early stage of viral infection. western blot analysis confirmed that EGFR was activated. total EGFR levels remained constant upon EGF treatment. induction of EGFR phosphorylation by EGF significantly enhanced virus replication. we overexpressed EGFR in IPEC-J2 cells to specifically activate EGFR. EGFR overexpression increased the levels of viral RNA. hek293 cells treated with EGFR overexpression facilitated PEDV replication. cytotoxic effects of erlotinib and gefitinib on EGFR activation were also confirmed by Western blotting of cell lysates from EGF-treated cells in the presence or absence of 10 M erlotinib or gefitinib. the number of PEDV-positive cells was significantly lower in erlotinib- or gefitinib-treated IPEC-J2 cells. reduced titers of viruses in infected cell cultures containing erlotinib or gefitinib were further analyzed and confirmed by measuring the TCID50. EGFR inhibitors erlotinib and gefitinib also had similar inhibitory effects on PEDV replication in HEK293 cells. EGFR inhibitors decreased PEDV RNA levels, as determined by quantitative RT-PCR. titers were reduced after inhibitor treatment, as detected by TCID50 assay. a specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) knock down endogenous expression of EGFR. hek293 cells were transfected with EGFR-specific siRNA (siEGFR) for 24 h. the knockdown efficiency of EGFR was determined by Western blotting. mRNA levels of several ISGs, including myxovirus resistance A (MxA), ISG15, and IFN-, were significantly increased in EGFR siRNA-transfected IPEC-J2 (Fig. 6A) and HEK293 (B) cells were transfected with control siRNA or EGFR-specific siRNA for 24 h. mRNA levels of three ISGs, MxA, ISG15, and IFN-, were significantly increased in IPEC-J2 and HEK293 (Fig. 7B) cells in the presence of the STAT3 inhibitor S3I-201 at a concentration of 40 M compared with a carrier control. this suggests that virus-induced STAT3 activation serves as a negative regulator of the IFN-I response. IPEC-J2 and HEK293 cells were treated with the STAT3-specific inhibitor S3I-201 (40 M) for 24 h. the RNA levels of ISGs, MxA, ISG15, and IFN- were determined by quantitative RT-PCR. at 48 hpi (IPEC-J2) or 24 hpi (HEK293), virus infection was determined by Western blotting with antibodies to PEDV N protein and -actin (loading control) STAT3 knockdown efficiency was verified by quantitative RT-PCR and quantitative RT-PCR. the levels of viral protein were increased in STAT3-transfected IPEC-J2 and HEK293 cells compared with vector control-transfected cells. the viral RNA levels in both IPEC-J2 and HEK293 cells confirmed the positive effect of STAT3 overexpression on PEDV infection. the results showed that EGF treatment increased viral protein synthesis and STAT3 siRNA decreased the levels of viral N protein. the increase of viral N protein synthesis by activated EGFR was blocked by depletion of STAT3 expression. the results are representative of three independent experiments (means and SD) EGFR is best known for its classical function as a tyrosine kinase receptor. it recruits downstream signaling and plays pivotal roles in cell-cell communication. EGFR overexpression has been associated with a number of human cancers. activated EGFR led to an increase in the PEDV titer. inhibition of EGFR activity by either inhibitors or siRNA resulted in a reduction of the PEDV titer. further evidence from an siRNA knockdown assay showed EGFR impaired the antiviral activity of type I interferon. a co-IP experiment was performed to address whether PEDV surface S protein interacted with EGFR. the main downstream pathways of EGFR activation include those mediated by PI3K-Akt-mTOR, Ras-Raf-MEK, and JAK2-STAT3 (49, 77, 78). phosphorylation by S3I-201 abrogates the antiviral ability of mature porcine IL-22 (mpIL-22) and the mpIL-22-induced expression of antimicrobial genes, such as BD-2, IL-18, survivin, and IFN- genes. however, they did not provide direct evidence of the involvement of STAT3 in PEDV infection. PEDV uses EGFR to suppress cellular antiviral defenses. PEDV strain CV777 (GenBank accession number KT323979) was titrated in vero E6 cells. IPEC-J2 cells were infected with PEDV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 for 48 h.
