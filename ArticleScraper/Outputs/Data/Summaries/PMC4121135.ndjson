{"summary": "eukaryotic mRNAs use a cap-dependent scanning mechanism to recruit the ribosome. internal ribosome entry sites are cis-acting elements that direct recruitment of the ribosome in a 5\u2032 end independent manner. polioviral IRES can still utilize the cleaved C-terminal fragment of eIF4G to mediate viral protein translation. members of the Dicistroviridae family infect arthropods including Drosophilidae, Aphidoidea, Caridea, and Apidae. the intergenic region IRES (IGR IRES) adopts a unique triple-pseudoknot RNA structure (Figure 1B) to direct ribosome recruitment without the need of initiation factors [11]\u2013[19]. translation of IAPV ORFx is mediated by a U-G base pair adjacent to PKI (dashed lines) the IGR IRESs can be classified into two types. infection by dicistroviruses leads to a shutoff of host protein synthesis. eIF2 is phosphorylated and eIF4E-eIF4G interactions are compromised. this leads to preferential IRES-dependent translation of the viral nonstructural and structural proteins during infection. 2A-containing bisictronic constructs to maximize detection of reporter luciferase activities. each IGR IRES with flanking upstream and downstream sequences was cloned between the EcoRI site and the NcoI site within the intergenic region of plasmid pEJ551[31] the bicistronic construct pRDEF was first described by the Sarnow group [32] the Thosea asigna virus (accession: AF062037) 2A sequence (Figure 2A) was inserted in frame and preceding the FLuc gene by using an overlapping PCR strategy. the arrow indicates the \u2018self-cleavage\u2019 or \u2018stop-go\u2019 site. transfection of RNA into S2 cells was obtained by in vitro transcription in the presence of cap analog [m7G(5\u2032)ppp(5\u2032)G] (Ambion) to GTP at a 51 ratio. RNAs were purified by RNeasy (Qiagen) cells were harvested 6 hour after transfection by centrifugation at 9600 g for 1 minute, followed by wash with 1 ml of PBS. pellets were then resuspended in 40 l of Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega) the concentration of protein in each lysate was determined by Bradford assay. ine labeling, the number of methionines were taken into account of each reporter protein. 100 l of Luciferase Assay Reagent II (Promega, Dual luciferase assay kit) was dispensed to measure FLuc activity. 96\u20136814 of acute bee paralysis (ABPV, accession: NC_002548), nucleotides 6381\u20136908 of Kashmir bee virus (KBV, accession: NC_004807) and nucleotides 4189\u20134797 of Solenopsis invicta virus (SINV-1, accession: NC_006559) reporter constructs were generated such that the UAA stop codon within SLVI serves as the termination codon for in vitro transcribed 5\u2032 capped bicistronic reporter RNAs were transfected into Drosophila S2 cells. cells were harvested at 6 hours, lysed and luciferase activity was measured. the white and black boxes represent RLuc and FLuc luciferase expression. bicistronic reporter RNAs (2 g) were transfected into S2 cells with 5 l of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in a total volume of 500 l of reduced serum medium. 4 mM of Dithiothreitol (DTT), 8 M of 4E1RCat (TOCRIS Bioscience) or a range of pateamine A (PatA) from 12.5 to 200 nM were added to cells 1 hour after RNAs were preheated at 65\u00b0C for 3 minutes and incubated in buffer E (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgOAc, 0.25 mM Spermidine, and 2 mM DTT) proteins were separated by a 16% SDS polyacrylamide gel, exposed to a phosphor storage screen. we cloned the IAPV and CrPV IRES within the intergenic region of the previously described bicistronic reporter construct. we also created constructs where specific 0 and +1 frame translation mediated by the IGR IRES can be monitored. for all constructs, expression of FLuc is IRES-dependent and RLuc is cap-dependent. ribosome cleavage results in nascent peptide cleavage between the two final amino acids of the peptide, glycine and proline. instead of ribosome dissociating from the mRNA, the ribosome continues translation starting from the proline codon. the 2A peptide is used by several positive strand RNA viruses to produce separate proteins during translation of the polyprotein. mutants abolish expression of 0 and +1 frame proteins, indicating that IRES translation was being measured. mutant PKI IRES did not result in expression of either 0 or +1 frame translation products, again confirming that IRES translation was being assayed (Figure S1, C lane 4). reporter RNAs containing the mutant PKI IRES did not result in expression of the FLuc activity. the +1 frame reporter constructs resulted in the synthesis of RLuc, the +1 frame cleaved proline-FLuc (P-FLuc) and ORFx-T2A proteins and the 0 frame *sORF2 (Figure 2C, lane 1). bicistronic reporter RNA increased linearly up to 6 hours post transfection. the maximum luciferase activity occurred 6\u201310 hours post transfection. cells were collected and FLuc activities were detected at 6 hours post transfection. we compared translational activities using a reporter RNA containing either the minimal core CrPV IGR IRES (nucleotides 6025\u20136231) or the IRES with sequences adjacent to the core IRES (nucleotides 5974\u20136372) the CrPV IRES containing regions adjacent to the core IRES was 5 fold more active than the minimal core IRES in vivo and 2 fold in vitro. we compared translation from a panel of dicistrovirus IGR IRESs. the fire ant dicistrovirus SINV-1 IGR IRES showed the highest translational activity, approximately 2-fold higher than that from the IAPV, ABPV and KBV IGR IRES. mutant G6618U IRES (G/U) resulted in loss of +1 frame translation in vivo. mutant G6618U IRES (G/U) resulted in loss of +1 frame ORFx translation in vivo and in S2 cells to a level similar to the empty reporter construct. in vitro transcribed capped T2A-containing reporter RNAs were transfected into S2 cells. cells were harvested at 6 hours after transfection. luciferase activities are shown as a ratio of FLuc/RLuc and as individual FLuc and RLuc activities. IRES translation was monitored by transfection of 5\u2032 capped bicistronic reporter RNAs in S2 cells treated with each stressor. stressors were added to the cells at 1 hour after transfection and cells were harvested 5 hours later. +1 frame translation increased to the same extent during DTT treatment. CrPV and IAPV IGR IRES-mediated 0 and +1 frame translation was monitored in S2 cells treated with DTT (4 mM) (A\u2013C), pateamine A (D), or 4E1RCat (8 M) (E) reporter RNAs containing the CrPV or IAPV IGR IRES were transfected in S2 cells. cells were treated alone or with the drug for another 5 hours. 4E1RCat treatment also stimulated IAPV IGR IRES +1 frame translation by 1.3 fold. this treatment did not stimulate +1 frame translation with the IAPV IGR IRES PKI mutant construct. 0 and +1 frame translation are stimulated in S2 cells to the same extent. mutant PKI IRES did not result in significant FLuc expression in mock- or CrPV-infected cells. in mock-infected cells, CrPV IGR IRES translation is 0.8% of cap-dependent translation. this is in part due to the 80\u201390% shutoff of overall cap-dependent translation. both 0 and +1 frame IAPV IGR IRES translation was stimulated 2.5\u20135 fold during CrPV infection. the 0 frame reporter RNA showed a similar fold increase at 6.5 h.p.i. CrPV infection. mutations that disrupt PKI basepairing in the IAPV IRES abolished 0 and +1 frame FLuc expression in mock- and CrPV-infected cells. reporter RNAs containing the wild-type or mutant (PKI) IAPV IGR IRES were transfected into mock or CrPV-infected (inf) S2 cells at 0.5 hour post infection. reporter RNAs monitoring (C) 0 frame or (D) +1 frame translation are shown. the CrPV (nucleotides 6217\u20136372) and IAPV ORF2 (nucleotides 6618\u20136908) were cloned in frame with the FLuc gene. the starting codons of the IAPV and CrPV structural proteins are glycine GGC and alanine GCU codons. we subcloned the T2A peptide directly upstream and in frame of the FLuc ORF. we first tested whether there were differences in IGR IRES-mediated 0 frame translation between T2A-less and T2A-containing bicistronic reporter constructs. we also tested whether there were differences in IGR IRES-mediated 0 frame translation between T2A-less and T2A-containing bicistronic reporter constructs. mutant PKI IRES did not result in expression of either 0 or +1 frame translation products. the ratio of FLuc/RLuc was measured either by quantitiating [35S]-methionine incorporation or by measuring the enzymatic luciferase activity. in vitro transcribed capped bicistronic RNAs were transfected into Drosophila S2 cells. the luciferase activity of an IRES-containing bicistronic reporter RNA increased linearly up to 6 hours post transfection and the maximum luciferase activity occurred 6\u201310 hours post transfection. a functional T2A-minus or mutant T2A (D/E) reporter RNA was detected. IGR IRES 0 frame translation in Drosophila cells mediated by the IAPV [31] and CrPV IGR IRESs was compared to an empty bicistronic reporter construct. mutant IRESs are inactive in in vitro translation experiments. mutant IRESs may still adopt a core structure that can still drive residual IRES translation in vivo. RES was 5 fold more active than the minimal core IRES in vivo. in vitro transcribed 5\u2032 capped bicistronic RNAs containing wild-type or mutant CrPV and IAPV IGR IRESs were transfected into Drosophila S2 cells. cells are harvested at 6 hours after transfection, lysed and luciferase activity was measured. fire ant dicistrovirus SINV-1 IGR IRES showed the highest translational activity, approximately 2-fold higher than that from the IAPV, ABPV and KBV IGR IRESs. we subcloned sequences adjacent to the IRES to ensure optimal translational activity. we also found that IAPV IGR IRES-dependent translation can be readily detected in another Drosophila cell line, Kc167 cells. a similar result was observed using the reporter construct with a stop codon in place of the +1 frame GCG starting codon (Figure 4A, 4B, lane 3 and 4C). insertion of the stop codon in the +1 frame did not affect 0 frame *sORF2 expression (Figure 4B, 4C), confirming that +1 frame translation was measured. the ratio of +1/0 frame translation is calculated to be approximately 20% by [35S] methionine labeling. in vivo studies, we compared the FLuc/RLuc ratio from the transfection experiments in Drosophila S2 cells using reporter RNAs that monitor either +1 or 0 frame translation. crPV and IAPV IGR IRES-mediated 0 and +1 frame translation was monitored in S2 cells treated with each stressor. stressors were added to the cells at 1 hour after transfection and cells were harvested 5 hours later. 4E1RCat treatment at 8 M stimulated CrPV and IAPV IGR IRES 0 frame translation by only approximately 1.2\u20131.5 fold. at higher 4E1RCat concentrations, both cap-dependent and IRES-dependent translation was significantly inhibited. IAPV IGR IRES translation was significantly down regulated by 80\u201390% as early as 1.5\u20132.5 hours of infection and by 6.5 hours post infection. in mock-infected cells, CrPV IGR IRES translation is 0.8% of cap-dependent translation, suggesting that IRES translation is weak in vivo. 6% of cap-dependent translation is due to the 80\u201390% shutoff of overall cap-dependent translation and the stimulation of IRES translation during CrPV infection. bicistronic reporter RNAs containing the wild-type or mutant CrPV IGR IRES were transfected into mock or CrPV-infected (inf) S2 cells at 0.5 hour post infection. cells were harvested at 6 hours after transfection and luciferase activities were measured. 0 frame IAPV IGR IRES translation was 1.1% and 11% of cap-dependent translation in mock- and CrPV-infected cells. 0 frame IAPV IGR IRES translation was 1.1% and 11% of cap-dependent translation in mock- and CrPV-infected cells. quantitative ratio of +1/0 frame IAPV IGR IRES translation in mock- or CrPV-infected cells. the ratios are normalized to that of the 1 hour after transfection in mock- or CrPV-infected cells. the ratios are normalized to that of the 1 hour after transfection in mock cells. the stimulation of IRES-mediated translation during infection is not due to the replication of viral RNAs simply outcompeting host mRNAs for ribosomes. this is the first report addressing IGR IRES translation in dicistrovirus-infected cells. a 20% ratio of +1/0 frame translation was observed using reporter RNA transfections in insect cells. both 0 and +1 frame translation mediated by the IAPV IGR IRES was stimulated to the same extent during CrPV infection in S2 cells. this suggests translation in both frames is regulated similarly by the IRES. bicistronic reporter constructs with FLuc gene fused in the 0 frame with sORF2 region. T2A-less and T2A-containing +1 frame bicistronic constructs were incubated in Sf21 extracts for 120 minutes. icistronic reporter RNAs containing the core CrPV IGR IRES (nucleotides 6025\u20136231) or the IRES with the adjacent sequences (\u2018IRES+\u2019, nucleotides 5974\u20136372) were transfected into S2 cells. cells were harvested at 6 hours after transfection and luciferase activities were measured."}
