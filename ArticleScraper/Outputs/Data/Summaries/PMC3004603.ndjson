{"summary": "a series of scattered outbreaks of the avian-to-human transmittable H5N1 virus has been mapping its way through Asia, the Pacific region, Africa, the Near East, and Europe. as of March 2010, 213 countries have been affected with a total number of infections and mortalities of 419,289 and 16,455, respectively. models for PI containment and mitigation have focused on integrating therapeutical and non-therapeutical measures in search for synergistic strategies. most of these approaches implement a form of social distancing to reduce infection exposure, followed by application of pharmaceutical means. a number of significant contributions have been made in this challenging area. MIDAS cross-validated the models by simulating the city of Chicago, with 8.6 M inhabitants, and implementing targeted layered containment. the recommendations were used in a pandemic preparedness guidance developed jointly by CDC, HHS, and other federal agencies. budget-based optimization model allocates a total resource budget, as opposed to a separate allocation of individual resources. both models seek to dynamically minimize the impact of ongoing outbreaks and the expected impact of potential outbreaks. the optimality criterion incorporates measures of morbidity, mortality, and social distancing. the framework subsumes a cross-regional simulation model, a set of single-region simulation models, and an overarching optimization control. regions inside the network are classified as unaffected, ongoing outbreak or contained. the single-region model emulates the (hourly) population and disease dynamics of each ongoing region, affected by mitigation measures. nt denotes the number of infectious travelers in the region at time t. cross-regional simulation stops when all outbreaks have been contained. single-region simulation model mimics population and disease dynamics within affected region. contact and infection processes occurs during contact events between susceptible and infectious cases in the mixing groups. each infectious case generates rg per t unit of time new contacts,37 chosen randomly from the susceptible. at the end of the latency phase, she becomes infectious and enters the infectious phase. at the end of the latency phase, she enters the final disease stage which culminates in her recovery or death. al treatment is subject to availability of the antiviral stockpile and administration capacity, measured in terms of the number of certified providers. the conformance level of the population at risk can be affected, among other factors, by the demographics and income level56\u201360 as well as the quality of public information. the model seeks to minimize the impact of ongoing outbreaks and the expected impact of potential outbreaks. the predictive mechanism of the optimization model is based on a set of regression equations obtained using single-region simulation models. X h k = h k 0 + i R h k i q i k + i, m R, i m h k i m q i k q m k, where i denotes the regression coefficient associated with resource i, and i m is the regression coefficient for the interaction between resources i and m. X h j n = n X h j, Y h j n = n Y h j, Y h j n = n Y h j, V h j n = n V h j. the regression equations can be re-estimated at every new outbreak epoch, for each region k Cn. each simulation must be initialized to the current outbreak status in TC k = h H ( m h + w h ) X h k n + h H w h Y h k n + h H w h Y h k n + h H w h D h k n + h H w h V h k n, (6) where mh total medical cost of an infected case in age group h over his budget-based model subject to i R c i q i q i j + s C n i R c i q i j + s C n i R c i q i q i s p s n M n, q i j, q i s 0 i R. the actual resource allocation q1j,q2j,... qrj for each ongoing region, implement a next day run of its single-region simulation. check the containment status of each ongoing region. update sets An and Bn, if needed. time t is calculated using the binomial probability law. nt denotes the number of infectious travelers in the region at time t. cross-regional simulation stops when all outbreaks have been contained. each infectious case generates rg per t unit of time new contacts. each infectious case generates rg per t unit of time new contacts,37 chosen randomly (uniformly) from the susceptible. During the latency phase, the individual becomes infectious and enters the infectious phase. at the end of the latency phase, she becomes symptomatic at the end of incubation. at the end of the latency phase, she becomes infectious and enters the infectious phase. at the end of the infectious phase, she enters the final disease stage which culminates in her recovery or death. antiviral treatment is subject to availability of the antiviral stockpile and administration capacity, measured in terms of the number of certified providers. both vaccination and antiviral application are affected by social behavioral factors, including conformance of the target population, degree of risk perception, and compliance of healthcare personnel. each individual is assigned a set of attributes (eg, age, gender, parenthood, workplace, infection susceptibility, probability of travel, etc.) each person is also assigned t time-discrete (eg, t = 1 hour) weekday and weekend schedules, which depend on: (i) person\u2019s age and parenthood, (ii) disease status, (iii) travel status, (iv) social distancing decrees in place. at the end of the latency phase, the individual becomes symptomatic. at the end of the latency phase, she becomes infectious and enters the infectious phase. at the end of the latency phase, she becomes symptomatic at the end of incubation. a fraction of the risk group does not comply with vaccination. the vaccine takes a certain period to become effective (typically, between 10 and 14 days) a fraction of the risk group does not comply with vaccination. optimization models are invoked at the beginning of every nth new regional outbreak epoch (n = 1,2,...), starting from the initial outbreak region (n = 1). the objective of the model is to allocate some of the available mitigation resources to the new outbreak region while reserving the rest of the resources for potential outbreak regions. optimization criterion (objective function) incorporates measures of societal and economic costs of the pandemic. the societal cost includes the cost of lost lifetime productivity of the deceased. the economic cost includes the cost of medical expenses of the recovered and deceased and the cost of lost productivity of the quarantined. we consider each region k as the initial outbreak region so that the values of Xhk, Yhk, Dhk, and Vhk are estimated for the entire pandemic period. we incorporate a decay factor n66 to adjust the estimates of the regional impact measures at every nth outbreak epoch. the total outbreak probability for unaffected region k can be found as p k = l B n p l k. we use a scheme similar to Eq. 4 to progressively adjust the estimates of the regional outbreak probabilities p k n = n p k. budget-based model subject to i R c i q i j + s C n q i s p s n Q i n i s p s n q i s p s n q i s p s n q i s p s n q i j + s C n i R c i q i j the first term of the objective function represents the total cost of the new outbreak j. the second term represents the total expected cost of outbreaks in currently unaffected regions. the budget-based model relates the total available budget at nth decision epoch with the total cost of the resources to be allocated (current and virtual) the second constraint assures a nonnegative allocation. testbed scenario included a network of four counties in Florida. a basic unit of time t was taken as one hour. regional simulations were run for a period (up to 180 days) until the daily infection rate approached near zero. p i ( t ) = i i ( t ) (7) where i is the age-dependent base instantaneous infection probability of contact i, i(t), is her status of vaccination at time t (0 or 1), and is the vaccine efficacy, measured as the reduction in the base instantaneous infection probability (achieved after 10 days) IAR is defined as the ratio of the total number of infections over the pandemic period to the size of the initial susceptible population. the value of R0 was calculated as the average reproduction number of a typical generation in the early stage of the pandemic, with no interventions implemented. an outbreak was considered contained if the daily infection rate did not exceed five cases, for seven consecutive days. once contained, a region was simulated for an additional 10 days for accurate estimation of the pandemic statistics. nurses 1,059 2,358 839 264 4,520 $27/hr 8 hr/day, 14 days $13.668 M Total budget requirement $157.737 M Table 5 shows the costs of lost productivity and medical expenses adopted from Meltzer, 199944 and adjusted for inflation for the year of 2010.82. for both models, the budget-based model dominates the quantity-based model at all levels of resource availability. this can be explained by noting that the total resource requirement was determined assuming the worst case scenario when all regions would be affected. the difference in the performance of two models was as high as 339,079 infected cases. the gap was 118,124 infected, 4,318 fatalities, and 5.07M in the pandemic cost. each infected person was assigned a daily travel probability of 0.24%,69 of which 7% was by air and 93% by land. the disease natural history for H5N1 virus included a latent period of 29 hours, an incubation period of 46 hours, and an infectiousness period between 29 and 127 hours. instantaneous infection

pandemic. for the four regions, the average value of R0 was 2.54, which represented a high transmissibility scenario. 80%.61 an outbreak was considered contained if the daily infection rate did not exceed five cases, for seven consecutive days. once contained, a region was simulated for an additional 10 days for accurate estimation of the pandemic statistics. value US$ Average cost of lost lifetime productivity of a deceased case (0\u201319) $1,336,347.86 Average cost of lost lifetime productivity of a deceased case (20\u201364) $1,370,987.28 Average cost of lost lifetime productivity of a deceased case (65\u201399) $98,959.24 Average cost of lost productivity and medical expenses of a recovered/deceased case (65\u201399) $11,566.09 Average daily cost of lost productivity of a

the curves for all impact measures exhibit a downward trend. increased total resource availability mediates a regional pandemic impact but also reduces the probability of spread to unaffected regions. 80% availability, gap was 118,124 infected, 4,318 fatalities, and 5.07M in the pandemic cost. the existing models fall short of providing dynamic decision support. the models support development of dynamic predictive resource allocation strategies for a network of regional outbreaks. the methodology presented in this paper is one of the first attempts to offer dynamic predictive decision support for pandemic mitigation. we have also developed a decision-aid simulator with a GUI which is made freely available to general public through our web site at http://imse.eng.usf.edu/pandemics.aspx. antiviral risk groups considered in the testbed can be adjusted. different prioritization schemes have been suggested in the literature. the form of social distancing implemented in the testbed can be modified."}
