{"summary": "AHSV is known to cause the most severe morbidity and mortality in infected animals. in susceptible horses, AHSV can cause different forms of disease ranging from mild fever to an acute form, characterized by high fever, depression, respiratory symptoms, severe weight loss, rough hair, lethargy, and apathy. the outer capsid is composed of two major structural proteins, VP2 and VP5. the serotype-determining protein VP2 is the most variable viral protein. the core particle consists of two concentric layers. the surface VP7 layer and the inner VP3 layer. reassortment of the two variable RNA segments encoded the outer capsid proteins VP2 and VP5 with the remaining eight RNA segments of BTV1. DISC viruses showed efficient replication in the complemented cell line but no virus production in any other mammalian or insect cell lines. vaccine strains showed neither a clinical reaction nor any detectable viremia (25) vaccinated mice were challenged with two virulent strains of AHSV. protection against homologous infection demonstrated the suitability of the vaccine strains as vaccine candidates. pCAG-AHSV1VP4, pCAG-AHSV1VP7, pCAG-AHSV1NS1 and pCAG-AHSV1NS2 plasmids were generated using a sequence-independent cloning system. each cDNA amplified from AHSV segments was cloned into the pUC19 vector and sequenced. the best-expressing clone was used for the recovery of VP6-deficient AHSV1. the best-expressing clone was used to produce a mixture of 10 capped RNA transcripts for AHSV1 using an mMESSAGE mMACHINE T7 Ultra kit (Ambion) 5 pCAG plasmids carrying the genes for VP1, VP3, VP4, VP6 and NS2 (80 ng each) followed by a second transfection at 16 hpt with a total of 500 ng of 10 capped AHSV1 RNA transcripts. each defective virus was titrated on BSR-VP6 cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1. mice were immunized subcutaneously twice 3 weeks apart with 106 PFU (100 l) of def-AHSV1 or def-AHSV4 and challenged by the same route 21 days after the second immunization with 105 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID50) all mice were weighed daily for 10 days after vaccination and infection and examined for clinical signs. blood samples were obtained from all mice at 3, 7 and 10 days after challenge. RNA from 20 l blood or 100 l tissue homogenate was extracted using a KingFisher 96 Flex purification system. a VP7-based real-time RT-quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay. pCAG-AHSV1VP1, pCAG-AHSV1VP3, pCAG-AHSV1VP4, pCAG-AHSV1VP6, pCAG-AHSV1VP7, pCAG-AHSV1NS1 and pCAG-AHSV1NS2 plasmids were cloned into the pUC19 vector and confirmed by sequencing. a complemented cell line expressing AHSV1 VP6 was generated a suspension of cells was seeded onto 150-mm culture plates. VP6-expressing colonies were selected in the presence of puromycin. the best-expressing clone was used for the recovery of VP6-defective viruses. the transfection medium was replaced with DMEM containing 1% FBS. incubation was continued for 2 to 3 days until the appearance of a cytopathic effect. to obtain reassortant def-AHSV, several segments were used to replace parental AHSV1. titer in wt AHSV1 cells was determined by plaque assay. each experiment was performed in triplicate and repeated twice. three strains of wt AHSV1 were used in this experiment. all mice were weighed daily for 10 days after vaccination and infection. no neurological signs, such as ataxia, paresis of one or more legs, or paralysis, were observed. animals showing severe symptoms were immediately euthanized, and the remaining infected and untreated control animals were euthanized at 2 or 3 weeks after challenge. all nine wt AHSV serotypes were then tested on BSR cells to assess virus titers and plaque phenotypes. three distinct groups of AHSV serotypes were observed: a large defined plaque phenotype with high titers (AHSV1) and a medium plaque phenotype with high titers (AHSV3, -5, and -6) the recovery of full copies of the 10 AHSV1 RNA segments was performed by a sequence-independent method. for each of the 10 segments, a T7 promoter-derived plasmid with the exact 3\u2032 end was generated to produce 10 capped T7 RNA transcripts. the protein-coding sequences of VP1, VP3, VP4, VP6, VP7, NS1 and NS2 formed the primary replicase complex. the bar chart shows the number of plaques per microgram of 10 capped AHSV1 T7-derived transcripts. the bars represent the average standard deviation. wt AHSV1 and RG-recovered virus (recAHSV1) analyzed on a 9% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. complemented cell line expressing AHSV1 VP6 was generated. one selected clone was passaged 30 times at a 1:20 dilution. normal BSR cells were used as a control. wt AHSV1 was plaque purified using the BSR-VP6 cell line. plaque morphology and analysis of genomic dsRNA segments showed the expected dsRNA profile. AHSV VP6 can be efficiently complemented and NS4 is dispensable. dsRNA of defective AHSV variants is indicated by green arrowheads. the red arrows correspond to the exchanged segments used for the recovery of defective AHSV variants. the exchange of AHSV VP2 only can lower the reassortant virus titers up to 3 log units (7). replacement of two outer capsid proteins with def-AHSV1 was not sufficient for all serotypes. replacement of two outer capsid proteins with def-AHSV1 was not sufficient for all serotypes. three additional serotypes were created by reassortment with 4 segments (S2, S6, S7, S3) to generate well-replicating reassortant def-AHSV2, five segments (S2, S6, S7, S3, S10) had to be replaced to achieve high titers on the complemented BSR-VP6 cell line. defective viruses (AHSV2, 3-, -4, -5, -6, and -7) were poorly recovered and these viruses exhibited def-AHSV1a 2 107 to 9 107 def-AHSV2 + + + + 1 107 to 4 107 def-AHSV3 + + + + 5 107 to 7 107 def-AHSV4 + + + + 3 107 to 1 108 def-AHSV5 + + + + 2 107 to 3 107 def-AHSV8 + + + 8 107 to 1 108 def-AHSV9 + + 7 107 to 1 108 the titer was analyzed by plaque assay on BSR-VP6 cells at 0, 24, 48, and 72 hpi. the three cell lines were infected at an MOI of 5 (BSR cells), 2.5 (KC cells), and 10 (E. Derm cells) the titer was analyzed by plaque assay on BSR-VP6 cells at 0, 24, 48, and 72 hpi. def-AHSV1 and reassortant def-AHSV4 effectively protect IFNAR/ mice from homologous infection. two groups of mice were immunized twice with 106 PFU of either def-AHSV1 or def-AHSV4. ted mouse group infected with AHSV1 representing a less virulent serotype showed no clinical signs. also, groups of mice vaccinated with either def-AHSV1 or def-AHSV4 showed no clinical signs. survival plots of adult IFNAR/ mice were presented as graph of inverted CT values obtained by RT-qPCR. the beta-actin housekeeping gene was present in all collected blood samples. RNA was quantified as described in Materials and Methods. AHSV1-infected mice showed low AHSV RNA levels to no AHSV RNA. all nine wt AHSV serotypes were tested on BSR cells to assess virus titers and plaque phenotypes. a large defined plaque phenotype with high titers (AHSV1), a medium plaque phenotype with high titers (AHSV3, -5, and -6) and a small/undefined plaque phenotype (AHSV2, -4, -7, -8, and -9) with low tit the protein-coding sequences of VP1, VP3, VP4, VP6, VP7, NS1 and NS2 were used to generate expression plasmids under the control of the pCAG promoter. the transfection of 3 to 7 expression plasmids followed by the transfection of exact copies of 10 capped AHSV1 T7-derived transcripts was performed. wt AHSV1 and RG-recovered virus (recAHSV1) analyzed on a 9% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. the positions of the genomic dsRNA segments are indicated on the right. the efficient RG system should be suitable for the generation of targeted, highly defective AHSV strains. AHSV1 VP6 was generated, and one selected clone was passaged 30 times at a 1:20 dilution. agar-overlaid monolayers were used to assess RNA infectivity. the plaque morphology and analysis of genomic dsRNA segments showed the expected dsRNA profile. AHSV VP6 can be efficiently complemented and NS4 is dispensable for AHSV replication in BSR cells. the segments exchanged in order to achieve high titers are indicated on top. the exchange of AHSV VP2 only can lower the reassortant virus titers up to 3 log units (7), resulting in impaired replication and/or particle instability. the exchange of AHSV VP2 only can lower the reassortant virus titers up to 3 log units (7), resulting in impaired replication. replacement of two outer capsid proteins with def-AHSV1 was not sufficient for all serotypes. def-AHSV8 and def-AHSV9 could be achieved by the reassortment with only 2 segments encoding the outer shell proteins VP2 and VP5. reassortant def-AHSV2, five segments (S2, S6, S7, S3, S10) had to be replaced to generate well-replicating (in BSR-VP6 cells) defective viruses (AHSV2, 3-, -4, -5, -6, and -7) were poorly recovered and these viruses exhibited a small plaque phenotype and low titers. defective AHSVs do not grow in AHSV-susceptible cell lines but yield high titers in the complemented cell line. complemented BSR-VP6 cells were infected with each virus at a low MOI. titers were determined at 24, 48, and 72 hpi. the titer was analyzed by plaque assay on BSR-VP6 cells at 0, 24, 48, and 72 hpi. the three cell lines were infected at an MOI of 5 (BSR cells), 2.5 (KC cells), and 10 (E. Derm cells). the titer was analyzed by plaque assay on BSR-VP6 cells at 0, 24, 48, and 72 hpi. 2 107 cells infected with each def-AHSV serotype should provide at least 75 to 200 doses. def-AHSV1 and reassortant def-AHSV4 effectively protect IFNAR/ mice from homologous infection. vaccinated with either def-AHSV1 or def-AHSV4 showed no clinical signs. survival plots of adult IFNAR/ mice immunized with 106 PFU of def-AHSV1 or def-AHSV4 (i.e., challenged [inf] with 105 TCID50 of the homologous wt AHSV1 or wt AHSV4 strain showed no clinical signs. leen, liver, and brain tissue samples were taken for RNA extraction. high loads of AHSV RNA were measured in all organs of nonvaccinated mice with AHSV4 infection. nonimmunized mice showed detectable levels of AHSV-specific RNA. but AHSV1-infected mice had no mortality or weight loss. orbivirus-like particles are safe and provide sufficient protection. they require complex preparation methods and suffer from low yields and problems with reproducibility. so far they have demonstrated significant variability in virus titers (7). to create replication-defective virus, we targeted disruption of the ORF of the essential replicative enzyme VP6, as well as the overlapping ORF of the less well-studied NS4 protein. mutations introduced into the S9multistop segment should be sufficient to allow differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals by quantitative RT-PCR. this, however, needs to be confirmed in future experiments. a low titer of the rescued virus is indicative of the problems associated with virus assembly, dissemination, and, possibly, genetic stability. it can be expected that swapping the large, most variable RNA segment, segment S2, to alter the serotype of the virus particle may have a number of consequences. ted in the virus budding process (35) we selected virus variants that efficiently replicated to titers equivalent to those of the wt virus. the extreme case was AHSV2, which required the exchange of five segments, including S10 (NS3). the possibility that RNA-RNA interactions are involved in the efficiency of reassortment between AHSV serotypes should also be considered. the in vitro complementation of a missing protein would represent a safer AHSV vaccine platform with a minimized genetic pressure toward the reversion to virulence. this study avoided deletion of the genes but disrupted the ORF of AHSV S9, coding for VP6 and NS4 by introducing multiple stop codons."}
