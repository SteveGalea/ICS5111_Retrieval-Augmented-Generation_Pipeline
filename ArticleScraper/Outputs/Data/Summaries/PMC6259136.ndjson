{"summary": "essential oils are aromatic oily liquids, volatile, characterized by a strong odour, rarely coloured, and generally with a lower density than that of water. essential oils only represent a small fraction of plant\u2019s composition; nevertheless they confer the characteristics by which aromatic plants are used in the food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries. allyl- and propenylphenols (phenylpropanoids) are also important components of some essential oils. the complexity of essential oils makes quantification arduous. terpenoids and phenylpropanoids have different metabolic precursors. many authors have concluded that this type of approach could be used successfully to generate noticeable levels of terpenoids. some authors have concluded that this type of approach could be used successfully to generate noticeable levels of terpenoids. essential oils play an important role in the attraction of insects to promote the dispersion of pollens and seeds or to repel other ones. essential oils are also able to scavenge free radicals. they can also act as anti-inflammatory agents. these diseases may result from cellular damage caused by free radicals. nitric oxide is produced in large quantities by the inducible nitric oxide synthases (iNOS) in activated macrophages and neutrophils during defence and immunological reactions. however this reactive species can exert its toxicity by generating the peroxynitrite anion after reacting with the superoxide anion radical [22,23,24,25] primary antioxidants are able to donate a hydrogen atom rapidly to a lipid radical, forming a new radical, which is more stable. secondary antioxidants can retard the rate of radical initiation reaction by elimination of initiators. direct and indirect methods have been applied to determine the chain-breaking antioxidant activity of natural products. the kinetic of lipid peroxidation or on the kinetic of non-chain process (direct competition methods) two modes of lipid peroxidation can be used for testing the antioxidant activity. one is the autoxidation mode when the process is progressing spontaneously, with self-acceleration due to the accumulation of LOOH. the other mode is based on the kinetic model of the controlled chain reaction. natural antioxidants compete for the peroxyl radical with a reference free radical scavenger. examples of reference free radicals scavengers include the fluorescent natural protein R-phycoerithrin and the natural crocin, or fluorescein. these radicals may be produced through the addition of AAPH or AMVA. the antioxidant ability of essential oils has also been evaluated using several methods. a recent review discusses the diversity of tests used by different authors for evaluating the antioxidant activity of essential oils. fatty acid methyl esters and low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) can be detected by measuring the substrate and the oxidant consumption, and the intermediates or the final products formation. some authors found that lavandula angustifolia Mill. oil was significantly more effective against lipid peroxidation than any of the other oils studied. basil had appreciable antioxidant activities, comparable to that of -tocopherol, the reference chosen by the authors. linalool, isoanethole and eugenol constituted the major components of the oils. oils of Persea gamblei were constituted by -caryophyllene, -gurjunene and -cubenene. these oils exhibited weak antioxidant abilities for preventing the linoleic acid oxidation. the -thujone-rich oil showed the best inhibition percentage (12.5%) the main components of the oils included -pinene, 1,8-cineole, -eudesmol, spathulenol, hedycaryol, -cadinene, among other components. the precentage of inhibition was even close to those found for the non-polar-sub-fraction (chloroformic) (69.1%), which presented the best activity. antimicrobial and antispasmodic activities of Origanum acutidens (Hand.-Mazz) Ietswaart from the turkish flora were evaluated. despite the high percentage of carvacrol present in the oil, the inhibition percentage only reached 65%, in contrast to the 100% of BHT. all essential oils tested (Thymus vulgaris L., [Eugenia caryophyllus (C. Spreng) Bull et Hare], Origanum vulgare L., Salvia officinalis L. and Rosmarinus officinalis L.) had antioxidant activity, but Thymus vulgaris oil presented the best activity, close to that verified for BHT. only the essential oils of dodecadenia grandiflora and Lindera pulcherrima were able to inhibit lipid peroxidation using liver homogenate as lipidic substrate. these oils, along with Persea gamblei, were already reported as being potent inhibitors of linoleic oxidation measured through the -carotene bleaching test. peroxidation was performed with ferrous sulphate. they found weak antioxidant activity due to the low phenolic content of oils. the main component was 1,8-cineole. the oils of Thymus vulgaris, Eugenia caryophyllus, Cinnamomum zeylanicum Blume., Ocimum basilicum L. and Illicium verum Hook were able to prevent the oxidation of hexanal to hexanoic acid promoted by heat and pure air introduced in a sealed system. such results may demonstrate the low importance of phenolic compounds to prevent hexanal oxidation. the oils of Thymus vulgaris and Origanum vulgare L. showed the best antioxidant activity index, but less than the activity of BHT (synthetic standard) p-cymene, -terpinene, linalool, thymol and carvacrol dominated in both cases. 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay is simple and highly sensitive. DPPH radical shows a strong absorption maximum at 517 nm (purple) authors in [62] found high antioxidant activities of essential oils of Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehnh. growing wild in different localities of Sardinia (Italia) the activities changed according to the chemical composition, neverthless generally constituted by p-cymene. a good activity was found by Saei-Dehkordi et al. (2010) [74] for the root oil of Ridolfia segetum (L.) Moris from Tunisia, because the IC50 values were close to that of BHT. a good activity could be attributed to the high amounts of two phenyl-propanoids, dillapiole and myristicin. authors identified 1,8-cineole and methyl eugenol as the components responsible for the moderate antioxidant activity of the essential oils of Myrtus communis L. IC50 values were generally >1,000 g/mL, substantially superior to that of quercetin. TBARS method had evaluated the capacity for scavenging free radicals. not always the best activity found in the TBARS assay corresponds to the best ability to scavenge DPPH radicals. the essential oils of Ageratum conyzoides or Amomum tsao ko showed better ability to prevent lipid peroxidation than for scavenging free radicals. the essential oil was the only one that had the worst capacity for scavenging free radicals. the methanolic fractions were always better antioxidants than the essential oils. researchers prefer to evaluate the antioxidant activity of essential oils through their ability to scavenge free radicals. essential oils of artemisia herba-alba have little ability for inhibiting lipid peroxidation. lavender essential oil also exhibited the highest DPPH-scavenging activity. the best oils were those of mentha. limonene had similar activity of that of Lavandula angustifolia. linalool and linalyl acetate constituted the major components of this essential oil. the best activity was found in the oil obtained from Laghouat. Cuminum cyminum, mainly constituted by cuminal, -terpinene, pinocarveol, carotol, -pinene, sabinene, -terpineol and linalool, presented the best activity. Eugenia caryophyllus (clove) showed the highest ferric reducing capacity in terms of Trolox\u00ae concentrations. water-like solvents induce a dramatic decrease in the hydrogen atom-donating capability in comparison with ethyl alcohol used in DPPH method. the main components of male leaf essential oil were -pinene/-thujene, spathulenol and bicyclogermacrene. the main component of female leaf essential oil was -3-carene. chelation of transition metals can stimulate lipid peroxidation by participating in the generation of initiating species and by accelerating peroxidation. ferrozine can quantitatively from complexes with Fe2+. in the presence of other chelating agents, the complex formation is disrupted, giving rise to a decrease of the red colour of the complex. all oils studied were better chelators of Fe2+ than ascorbic acid and BHT. hydroxyl is the most reactive one, inducing severe damage to the adjunct biomolecules. the deoxyribose test includes a mixture of ferric chloride (FeCl3) and ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid. authors have evaluated the ability to scavenge hydroxyl radicals of the essential oils of Thymus marschallianus and Thymus proximus using the safranine method. the activity of both oils were dose-dependent and they were mainly constituted by thymol, p-cymene and -terpinene. the oils from young and mature leaves of Ageratum scoparia Waldst. & Kit. displayed a high degree of hydroxyl radical scavenging activity. however, the scavenging activity of principle constituents, -myrcene and p-cymene, was very less compared to that of oils. the mature fruits of Athamanta turbith ssp. hungarica and Athamanta turbith s dehydrogenase is a dehydrogenase enzyme that transfers electrons to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), reducing it to NADH, and oxidizes xanthine or hypoxanthine to uric acid. superoxide anion can be generated by this system (the hypoxanthine - xanthine oxidase) or using a non-enzymatic reaction lipid oxidation is a complex reaction that can be generated via three different pathways. the first pathway leads to rapid progressing, destructive chain reactions, generating hydroperoxides and volatile compounds. the first pathway leads to initiation of rapidly progressing, destructive chain reactions, generating hydroperoxides. lavandula angustifolia mill. oil from australia was significantly more effective against lipid peroxidation than any of the other oils studied. the oils of Thymus vulgaris L. (thyme), [Eugenia caryophyllus (C. Spreng) Bull et Hare], and Ocimum basilicum L. (basil) had appreciable antioxidant activities, comparable to that of -tocopherol. -carotene bleaching method estimates the relative ability of antioxidant compounds in plant extracts to scavenge the radical of linoleic acid peroxide that oxidizes -carotene. -carotene in the absence of the antixodant undergoes a rapid decolourization since the free linoleic acid radical attacks the -carotene. -thujone, -thujone, thujones ( + ), and 1,8-cineole/camphor/thujones ( + ). all oils showed weak antioxidant abilities for preventing the linoleic acid oxidation. the -thujone-rich oil showed the best inhibition percentage (12.5%) essential oils were able to inhibit the bleaching of -carotene. the precentage of inhibition was even close (66.4%) to those found for the non-polar-sub-fraction (chloroformic) (69.1%), which presented the best activity. authors did not explain these results which are contradictory to those obtained when the antioxidant activity was measured. rol present in the oil, the inhibition percentage only reached 65%. the method measures the malondialdehyde formed after lipid hydroperoxide decomposition (secondary products of oxidation) this coloured complex, which absorbs at 532 nm, results in the condensation of TBA and malondialdehyde in an acidic environment. p-cymene, -terpinene, cis-sabinene hydrate, linalool and p-cymene predominated in the oils. authors stressed the importance of p-cymene in the antioxidant activity of Thymus proximus. linoleic oxidation measured through -carotene bleaching test. oils presented at 1 g/L lower ability to inhibit lipid peroxidation than BHA, but close to that of BHT. differences in the chemical composition of the oils were not significant. acrene D, furanodienone, curzerenone, and sabinene and limonene, respectively, possess different chemical compositions. the authors found that for higher concentrations of essential oils a decrease of the activity was observed, suggesting that high concentrations of essential oils possess a pro-oxidant activity. the oils of Thymus vulgaris, Eugenia caryophyllus, Cinnamomum zeylanicum Blume., Ocimum basilicum L. and Illicium verum Hook. f. were able to prevent the oxidation of hexanal to hexanoic acid promoted by heat and pure air introduced in a sealed system. such results may demonstrate the low importance of phenolic compounds to prevent hexanal oxidation p-cymene, -terpinene, linalool, thymol and carvacrol were the main components in both cases. the presence of this component could be the responsible for the highest antioxidant activity assessed by Rancimat test. lavandula angustifolia mill. oil from australia was significantly more effective against lipid peroxidation than any of the other oils studied. such oil was predominantly constituted by linalool and lynalyl acetate. -carotene in the absence of the antixodant undergoes a rapid decolourization since the free linoleic acid radical attacks the -carotene. the oils of dodecadenia grandiflora Nees, Lindera pulcherrima (Nees) Benth. ex Hook. f. and Persea gamblei (King ex Hook. f.) were able to inhibit linoleic the essential oils of different parts of myrtus communis var. italica L. leaf, stem and flower were chemically evaluated. -pinene, 1,8-cineole, -eudesmol, spathulenol, hedycaryol, -cadinene, among other components, nevertheless predominating the oxygenated sesquiterpenids. the polar fraction rich in phenolic compouds had the greatest activity. the percentage inhibition of Salvia eremophila Boiss was of about one third of that of BHT, in contrast to the methanolic extracts of the same plant. nm, results in condensation of TBA and malondialdehyde in acidic environment. essential oil of Ageratum conyzoides L., mainly constituted by precocene I and caryophyllene, possessed good capacity for preventing lipid peroxidation. authors have also tested methanolic extracts of the same plants but the activities were about 100 times lower than those of the essential oils. carvacrol, thymol, p-cymene and -terpinene predominated in the oils. p-Cymene, -terpinene and -terpinene predominated in the oils. authors stressed importance of p-cymene in antioxidant activity of Thymus proximus. sabinene and limonene were the main components of Crithmum maritimum oil. differences in the chemical composition of the oils were not significant. authors found weak antioxidant activity due to low phenolic content. a decrease of the activity was observed, suggesting that high concentrations of essential oils possess a pro-oxidant activity. the oils were able to decrease the high levels of TBARS in cardiac or liver tissues. the oils were able to decrease the high levels of TBARS in cardiac or liver tissues, protecting them against stress induced oxidation. f. were able to prevent the oxidation of hexanal to hexanoic acid promoted by heat and pure air introduced in a sealed system, after 40 days of storage. results may demonstrate the low importance of phenolic compounds to prevent hexanal oxidation. p-cymene, -terpinene, linalool, thymol and carvacrol dominated in both cases. the presence of thymoquinone could be responsible for the highest antioxidant activity assessed by Rancimat test. some authors only use DPPH method for evaluating the antioxidant activities of essential oils. some authors found low antioxidant activity of Commiphora ornifolia and Commiphora parvifolia. essential oil of Majorana hortensis L. had appreciable antioxidant activity probably ascrible to carvacrol with positive synergism with other components. limonene, E-citral, Z-citral and 3,3-dimethyl-1-hexene were described as possessing moderate antioxidant activity. a good activity was found by Saei-Dehkordi et al. (2010) [74] for the root oil of Ridolfia segetum (L.) because the IC50 values were close to that of the reference BHT. such antiradical activity could be attributed to the high amounts of two phenyl-propanoids, dillapiole and myristicin. only 17 species possessed effective antioxidant activity, mainly from the Lamiaceae family. some authors choose only one method for evauating the antioxidant activity. but the great majority prefers to check at least two assays. ia gamblei presented the best inhibition of lipid peroxidation determined through the TBARS method and in the -carotene bleaching test. but in the DPPH method, only dodecadenia grandiflora was a powerful DPPH radical scavenger. the same authors also used the Rancimat test, and in that ase, the best oil was that of Origanum vulgare, although worse than that of the reference BHT. this method relies on the reduction of the blue-green cation radical of ABTS+\u2022 by measuring the reduction of the radical cation as the percentage of inhibition of absorbance at 734 nm. the results are expressed in terms of Trolox\u00ae equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) essential oils of artemisia herba-alba have little ability for inhibiting lipid peroxidation. thymol and its precursors p-cymene and -terpinene, along with borneol in Satureja intricata, were not effective against lipid oxidation nor as a free radical scavenger. limonene had similar activity of that of Lavandula angustifolia. the best activity was found in the oil obtained from Laghouat, mainly constituted by -pinene + -thujene, camphene and spathulenol. the best activity was found in the oil obtained from Laghouat. the essential oil of Eugenia caryophyllus exhibited higher activity than volatile aglycone fraction. the reducing capacity of the essential oil was higher than that of volatile aglycone fraction. this lower activity could be attributed to the antagonism among other constituents. the high reducing power for male oil was detected during the month of June and during the months of September - October for the female oils. the antioxidant activity of the female oil was almost ten times higher than ascorbic acid in the FRAP assay. essential oils of myrtus communis, Thymus marschallianus and Thymus proximus generally did not present chelating activity. ferrozine can quantitatively from complexes with Fe2+. in the presence of other chelating agents, the complex formation is disrupted, giving rise to a decrease of the red colour of the complex. the deoxyribose test includes a mixture of ferric chloride (FeCl3) and ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), which forms Fe2+-EDTA and oxidized form of ascorbic acid. this is the so-called Fenton reaction, which generates the highly reactive hydroxyl radical (Fe2+ + H2O2 Fe3+ + HO + HO\u2022) phenolic chromenes precocene I and precocene II obtained different responses according to the method used. authors explained such results to the relative reactivity of hydroxyl radical towards the substrates deoxyribose and benzoic acid. ssp. haynaldii are rich in essential oils, myristicin being the main component of both oils. the capacity for scavenging hydroxyl radicals was always less than 50%, at the concentrations assayed (100-2,000 mg/mL) superoxide anion reduces nitro-blue tetrazolium into formazan. only Thymus zygis ssp. sylvestris and Thymus capitellatus collected in different places of Portugal had superoxide anion scavenging activity >50%. some authors only use DPPH method for evaluating the antioxidant activities of essential oils. some authors found low antioxidant activity of Commiphora ornifolia and Commiphora parvifolia. phellandrene, spathulenol and cryptone in different proportions according to harvesting place and period. limonene, E-citral, Z-citral and 3,3-dimethyl-1-hexene also had antioxidant activity. authors conclude microencapsulation increased anti-radical activity from fourfold to eightgold. a good activity was found by Saei-Dehkordi et al. (2010) [74] for the root oil of Ridolfia segetum (L. Moris) because the IC50 values were close to that of BHT. such antiradical activity could be attributed to the high amounts of two phenyl-propanoids, dillapiole and myristicin [60] a comparative evaluation of the antioxidant properties of 248 essential oils by the spectrophotometer method of DPPH along with DPPH/TLC. only 17 species possessed effective antioxidant activity, mainly belonging to the Lamiaceae family. the great majority prefers to check at least two assays. the authors found that the Thymus vulgaris oil had the best activity against lipid oxidation. in the DPPH method, the authors found that Eugenia caryophyllus oil was the most potent scavenger of DPPH free radicals. in that ase, the best oil was that of Origanum vulgare, although worse than that of the reference BHT. the results are expressed in terms of Trolox\u00ae equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC). some authors only used the ABTS method for evaluating the antioxidant activity of essential oils [75,76]. essential oils of artemisia herba-alba were not effective against lipid oxidation nor as a free radical scavenger. the best oils were those of mentha x piperita L and Boswellia carteri Birdw. limonene had similar activity of that of Lavandula angustifolia. DPPH free radicals had a higher antioxidant capacity relative to reference ascobic acid. the best activity was found in the oil obtained from Laghouat. the same authors also reported diverse activities depending on the harvesting place. DPPH and FRAP methods showed that the essential oil of Eugenia caryophyllus exhibited higher activity than the volatile aglycone fraction obtained after enzymatic hydrolysis with -glucosidase from bitter almonds of the extract. the antioxidant activity of clove oil was higher than the volatile aglycone fraction, although both samples have high eugenol content. the female oil was almost ten times higher than ascorbic acid in the FRAP assay [81]. the presence of reducing agents causes the conversion of Fe3+/ferricyanide complex to the ferrous form. the presence of reducing agents causes the conversion of Fe3+/ferricyanide complex to the ferrous form. essential oils of myrtus communis, Thymus marschallianus and Thymus proximus generally did not present chelating activity. the sole exception was the essential oils of flowers of myrtle. the authors explained this activity to the presence of eugenol and methyl eugenol. hydroxyl radicals that are not scavenged by any component of the mixture attack the deoxyribose and degrade it into several fragments. some of these fragments are capable of reacting with thiobarbituric acid after heating and in an acidic pH, originating a pink pigment. the authors explained such results to the relative reactivity of hydroxyl radical towards the substrates deoxyribose and benzoic acid. the oils from young and mature leaves of Ageratum scoparia Waldst. & Kit. displayed a high degree of hydroxyl radical scavenging activity. athamanta turbith ssp. hungarica was the most effective, albeit with less ability than the references used (quercetin and ascorbic acid) the capacity of the essential oils obtained from the aerial parts or from the fruits of Foeniculum vulgare was always less than 50%, at the concentrations assayed (100-2,000 mg/mL) only Thymus zygis ssp. sylvestris and Thymus capitellatus collected in different places of Portugal had superoxide anion scavenging activity >50%. phenolic compounds are not the only ones able to scavenge superoxide anion, as already reported for hydroxyl radical scavenging. chamomile essential oil has been used for centuries as an anti-inflammatory. eucalyptus, rosemary, lavender, millefolia and other plants have been used as mixed formulations as anti-inflammatory agents. carrageenan-induced mouse paw oedema is frequently used to determine the anti-inflammatory activity of diverse bioactive compounds. the prostaglandins, especially prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) amplify the pain mechanism. the leukotrienes contract the smooth muscles of blood vessels, enhance vascular permeability and mediate proinflammatory and allergic responses. ole, -pinene and -caryophyllene in the essential oils of four indigenous species were also reported to inhibit 5-lipoxygenase. the same major components present in the essential oils of chamomile were also reported to inhibit 5-lipoxygenase. IL-1 is produced by a variety of cells types, including monocytes, macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells. the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines may be induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that is an endotoxin localised on Gram negative bacteria cell walls capable to activate macrophages. but Gram positive bacteria may also contribute to the stimulation in the production of cytokines. essential oil of Cinnamomum osmophloeum Kaneh, mainly constituted by 1,8-cineole along with -pinene, camphor and p-cymene, decreased the production of the cytokines TNF- and IL-6. the ability to inhibit IL-1 and IL-6 production but not TNF- was attributed to 1,8-cineole, santoline, spathulenol and cary cordia verbenacea essential oil significantly reduced TNF- and IL-1 levels in the subcutaneous tissue of the rat paw injected with carrageenan [112] some authors showed that only -humelene was able to reduce significantly the increase of TNF- and IL-1 levels in the subcutaneous tissue of the rat paw. citral, the main component of the fruit essential oil of Cinnamomum insularimontanum Hayata, inhibits TNF- in RAW 264.7 cells stimulated by LPS. citral also inhibits IL-1 and IL-6 pro-inflammatory cytokines. only myristicin, the major component of nutmeg oil, presented a potent hepatoprotective activity by suppressing LPS/D-GalN induced enhancement of serum TNF- concentrations and hepatic DNA fragmentation in mice. the hepatoprotective activity of myristicin might be due to the inhibition of TNF- release from macrophages. trans-Caryophyllene, -elemene and germacrene D were the major components present in the present oil. some combinations lowered the amounts of IL-1 and IL-6 cytokines. the inhibitory effect of some essential oils on the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines appears to be mediated by suppressing gene expression of these cytokines. inflammatory mediators such as IL-1, TNF- or LPS stimulate iNOS expression in rodent macrophages in vitro. iNOS catalises the production of large amount of NO from L-arginine and molecular oxygen. inhibition of activity or expression of COX-2 by some anti-inflammatory is due to interference with signalling mechanisms that regulate the COX-2 gene. translocation of p65:p50 to the nucleus results in the transcription of several proinflammatory genes, such as cytokines (TNF-, IL-1, IL-6) and inducible enzymes. studies have revealed some compounds are able to suppress proinflammatory cytokines and NF-B. PPAR activation results in increased expression of IB, the inhibitory protein that prevents the transfer of NF-B to the nucleus. only the essential oils of Teucrium brevifolia Schreber and Teucrium montbretii Benth inhibited LPS-induced NO production in macrophage cell line RAW 264.7. origanum syriacum L. predominatly composed by carvacrol and thymol did not show such ability. more examples of NO inhibition can be reported, for example the production of NO was also inhibited by the citrus peel waste essential oil in LPS-activated RAW 264.7 macrophages. acetate, limonene and -pinene, on pro-inflammatory mediators (NO and PGE2) were related to the modulation of iNOS and COX-2 expression, since the expression of iNOS and COX-2 mRNA and iNOS and COX-2 protein was reduced. an inhibitory effect of kitamura essential oil, namely constituted by 1-undecene, 1-nonene and -caryophyllene, on the most remarkable activity was reported for three Pimpinella species and five pure compounds: Pimpinella corymbosa Boiss., Pimpinella tragium Vill. ssp. polyclada (Boiss. et Heldr. Tutin), Pimpinella rhodanta Boiss. oils and 4-(2-propenyl)phenylangelate, 4-(3-methyl-oxiranyl)phenyltiglate citral suppressed both LPS-induced COX-2 mRNA and protein expression, dose-dependently. in human macrophage-like U937 cells, carvacrol suppressed both LPS-induced COX-2 mRNA and protein expression, suggesting that citral activates PPAR and, and, and regulates COX-2 expression. anethole, eugenol and isoeugenol inhibited TNF-induced NF-B activation in ML1-a cells. anethole blocked phosphorylation of MAP kinase in ML1-a cells. anethole also blocked JNK and AP-1. essential oil from the leaves of Juniperus oxycedrus L. showed great inhibition of IL-1-induced NO production in the human chondrocytic cell line C-28/12. the same oil and a -pinene-rich fraction reduced markedly IL-1-induced IB degradation and phosphorylation, NF-B-DNA binding activity and NO production. essential oils and their main components in the modulation of the anti-inflammatory response are described in the text together with the examples of essential oils and components. the authors attributed such activities to the presence of 1,8-cineole, -pinene and -caryophyllene in the essential oils. essential oils of leaves and rhizomes of alpinia murdochii Ridl., alpinia scabra (Blume) N\u00e1ves and alpinia pahangensis Ridl. also showed to be good 5-lipoxynease inhibitors. -Pinene, -pinene and sabinene were the main components of the leaf oils. lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is an endotoxin localised on Gram negative bacteria cell walls capable to activate macrophages, stimulating the production of inflammatory cytokines. the essential oil of Cheistocalyx operculatus significantly inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced secretion of IL-1 and TNF-cytokines in mouse macrophage-like cells. essential oils of taxandria fragrans decreased production of cytokines TNF- and IL-6. ability to inhibit IL-1 and IL-6 production but not TNF- was attributed to 1,8-cineole, santoline, spathulenol and caryophyllene oxide. some authors showed that only -humelene was able to reduce significantly the increase of TNF- and IL-1 levels in the subcutaneous tissue of the rat paw injected with carrageenan. in this essential oil, kaurene, elemol, -eudesmol and sabinene prevailed in this essential oil. citral, the main component of the fruit essential oil of Cinnamomum insularimontanum Hayata, inhibits TNF- in RAW 264.7 cells stimulated by LPS. citral, the main component of the fruit essential oil of Cinnamomum insularimontanum Hayata, inhibits IL-1, TNF- and PGE2. citral also suppresses IL-1 and IL-6 pro-inflammatory cytokines. thyme (Thymus vulgaris L.), chenpi (Citrus unshiu Markov.), nutmeg (Myristica fragrans Houtt), star anise (Illicium verum Hook f.), paprika (Capsicum frutescens L.), fennel (Foeniculum vulgare Mill.), black pepper (Piper nigrum L.), Japanese mint (Mentha arven essential oils studied significantly suppressed the protein and mRNA expression of the cytokines in stimulated cells. the inhibitory effect of these essential oils on the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines appears to be mediated by suppressing gene expression. iNOS catalises the formation of NO and prostaglandins, respectively. NF-B is a transcriptional regulator that consists of homo- and heterodimers of proteins (p65 or RelA, p50/p105, c-Rel, p52/p100 and RelB) it is phosphorylated by IB kinases (IKK) leading to proteasome-dependent degradation of IB. the most predominant NF-B dimmer activated is p65:p50. PPARs are ligand-activated transcription factors that belong to the superfamily of nuclear hormone receptors. PPARs play various roles in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, cell proliferation and differentiation. PPAR activation results in increased expression of IB, the inhibitory protein that prevents the transfer of NF-B to the nucleus. only the essential oils of Teucrium brevifolia Schreber and Teucrium montbretii Benth. ssp. heliotropiifolium (Barbey) Davis from a group of four studied effectively inhibited LPS-induced NO production in macrophage cell line RAW 264.7. NO was also inhibited by the citrus peel waste essential oil in LPS-activated RAW 264.7 macrophages. the same monoterpene inhibited NO release but did not inhibit iNOS expression. the same monoterpene inhibited NO release but did not inhibit the increase of iNOS expression. undecene, 1-nonene and -caryophyllene inhibit NO and PGE2 production in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. the oil of Illicium anisatum L., mainly constituted by 1,8-cineole, also demonstrated its capacity for inhibiting NO and PGE2 production in rat paw. mpinella rhodanta Boiss studied the effect of citral on NF-B pathway. citral suppressed both LPS-induced COX-2 mRNA and protein expression. citral induced the PPAR and the PPAR mRNA expression. carvacrol suppressed LPS-induced COX-2 mRNA and protein expression. carvacrol regulates COX-2 expression through its agonistic effect on PPAR. but this property was not as remarkable as that of citral. anethole inhibited the degradation of IB, blocking its phosphorylation. anethole also blocked TNF-induced JNK and AP-1. early growth response factor-1 (Erg-1) is a transcription factor. the search for anti-inflammatory activities in essential oils has also increased during these last years. this work reports the antioxidant activities of essential oils which may act by preventing lipid peroxidation, scavenging free radicals or chelating metal ions. the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of the essential oils are well documented. however their uses can be hampered due to the chemical variability of the oils."}
