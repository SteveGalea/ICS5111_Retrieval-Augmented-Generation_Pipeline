{"summary": "IAV and IBV genomes contain eight negative sense, single-stranded viral (v)RNA segments [1]. vRNAs in the virion are found as viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complexes encapsidated by the viral nucleoprotein (NP) and a single copy of the viral polymerase complex. the viral lipid bilayer is a protein layer composed of the M1 protein, which plays a role in virion assembly and budding, and the nuclear export protein (NEP) involved in the nuclear export of the viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complexes. the eight viral segments and protein products are indicated inside the virions. influenza viruses encode two surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) influenza viruses encode two surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) influenza viral HA undergoes a conformational change responsible for the fusion of the viral and the endosome membrane. the ion channel proteins promote the release of the vRNP complexes from the virion core into the cytoplasm of infected cells. a single copy of each of the eight vRNAs is packaged into new virions. influenza virus is one of the most significant causes of morbidity and mortality yearly, leading to a significant economic impact. despite the implementation of effective and comprehensive vaccination programs, the world health organization estimates that seasonal influenza virus infections results in about one billion infections, 3\u20135 million cases of severe disease and between 300,000 and 500,000 deaths around the world annually. IAVs and IBVs can reassort intratypically between subtypes or lineages. intertypic reassortment is mediated by the lack of compatible packaging signals between IAV and IBV. of these three, the 1918 H1N1 Spanish flu was particularly fatal. influenza vaccines have been approved by the fda for human use. influenza vaccines contain antigens from the three circulating influenza virus strains. the most common influenza vaccine is recombinant viral HA, inactivated virus and live attenuated viruses. IIV has been shown to elicit protective humoral immunity by producing NAbs that target epitopes on HA [61,71] the live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) mimics the natural route of virus infection, which consequently has risks and benefits [72,73] there is an unmet need to increase the effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccines. there is an urgent need to develop effective vaccines for the treatment of potential pandemic influenza viruses. influenza viruses belong to the Orthomyxoviridae family of enveloped viruses. IAV and IBV genomes contain eight negative sense, single-stranded viral (v)RNA segments. vRNAs in the virion are found as viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complexes encapsidated by the viral nucleoprotein (NP) and a single copy of the viral polymerase complex. in the virion membrane is the ion channel M2 (IAV) or BM2 and NB (IBV) proteins. under the viral lipid bilayer is a protein layer composed of the M1 protein. the nuclear export protein (NEP) involved in the nuclear export of the viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complexes. initiation codon of BM2 protein overlaps termination codon of BM2 protein. IBV expresses the NB ion channel, which is absent in type A influenza virus [1]. both influenza viruses encode two surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) influenza viral HA protein binds to its cellular receptor, a sialylated glycoprotein containing -2,3 or -2,6 linkages [16] Upon the binding to the receptor, the uptake of the virus by receptor-mediated endocytosis is initiated. the cell membrane engulfs the virus particles in an endosome. influenza virus is one of the most significant causes of morbidity and mortality yearly, leading to a significant economic impact. influenza virus is one of the most significant causes of morbidity and mortality yearly, leading to a significant economic impact. intertypic reassortment is mediated by the lack of compatible packaging signals between IAV and IBV. three IAV pandemics have occurred in the last century: the H1N1 Spanish flu of 1918, the H2N2 Asian flu of 1957 and the H3N2 Hong Kong flu of 1968. the 1918 H1N1 Spanish flu was particularly fatal and responsible for approximately 50 million deaths around the world. influenza viruses contribute more than type A H1N1 influenza strains. they are the predominant circulating virus strains once every three years. no influenza pandemics have been linked to IBVs. vaccines are our best medical intervention to protect humans against seasonal influenza virus. the most common influenza vaccine is the inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) the live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) mimics the natural route of virus infection, which consequently has risks and benefits [72,73] there is an unmet need to increase the effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccines. emergence of drug-resistant influenza variants is increasing concern for controlling influenza infections. influenza vaccines need to be reformulated yearly to ensure that the HA and NA present in the vaccine match those present in circulating seasonal viruses. the most common influenza vaccine is the inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV), which is administered intramuscularly. influenza antivirals offer an additional countermeasure against new rapidly-spreading and/or potentially pandemic influenza viruses. vaccines are currently limited to two classes of FDA-approved antivirals targeting either the viral M2 ion channel (amantadine, rimantadine, rimantadine) and the sialidase active site of NA (oseltamivir, zanamivir) the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN) [35] includes more than 120 national influenza centers in over 90 countries. each center collects and analyzes samples of seasonal influenza viruses for communication to the WHO Collaborating Centers for Reference and Research on Influenza. the degree of immunity induced by one influenza strain that is effective against another strain is mainly dependent on the antigenic difference between both viral strains. the strains included in the vaccine composition for the northern Hemisphere must be selected almost 7\u20139 months ahead of the influenza season. this allows time for the 300 million doses of vaccine to be produced in time for vaccinating people in October/November. influenza vaccines must protect against H1N1, H3N2 and B viral strains currently circulating in humans globally [34,86] whole virus vaccines are safe and well tolerated, with an efficacy of 60%\u201390% in children and adults. split-virus vaccine exposes all viral proteins and subviral elements upon dissociation of the virions by a nonionic detergent treatment step. most influenza vaccines in the united states and europe are egg-produced, formaldehyde-inactivated, then chemically disrupted with nonionic detergents after purification. IAV strains used in vaccine manufacture are high-growth 6 + 2 reassortants containing the HA and NA gene segments from the target strains in the backbone of influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 H1N1 (PR8) reassortants are cloned and sequenced for confirmation. the remaining class of vaccines consists of live-attenuated influenza viruses. the current LAIVs consist of the internal viral segments (PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M and NS) of an attenuated master donor virus (MDV) and the HA and NA viral segments from the selected seasonal virus strain. resulting IBV MDV grows efficiently at 25 \u00b0C (ca) but its growth is restricted at 37 \u00b0C (ts) laIVs harboring different HA and NA viral segments can be unequally safe or immunogenic from year to year. in Russia, two ts, ca MDV IAVs have been obtained by using a similar temperature adaptation approach. the two Russian MDVs were originated from the same parental influenza strain Len/57). the majority of the currently licensed influenza vaccines that are made by biotechnology companies use fertilized chicken egg-based production technology. this process depends on the access to embryonated eggs and relies on the ability of influenza viruses to efficiently grow in eggs. the risk of egg contamination by avian pathogens or microbes represents a risk for the production of influenza vaccines. influenza vaccine production in mammalian cell lines offers several advantages over egg-based production. it allows faster and greater production capacity, improved availability of substrate for virus growth. cell cultures can be cryopreserved and scale up in bioreactors at any time. influenza viral glycoprotein HA is the primary target of the protective neutralizing immune responses [88,89] influenza vaccine production is challenging because of the wait time that is needed to identify the predominant circulating virus and the production time that is needed to manufacture the vaccine. the vaccine strains must be selected 7\u20139 months ahead of the influenza season in which they will be used. influenza vaccines must protect against H1N1, H3N2 and B viral strains circulating in humans globally. the main goals of influenza vaccines are the protection against infection and disease caused by influenza infections and to restrict virus transmission within the population. both the WHO candidate virus and the high-growth virus for influenza inactivated vaccine (A) and the master donor virus (MDV) for live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) (B) are inoculated in eggs followed by the selection of appropriate seed viruses by amplification in the presence of antibodies against the HA and NA of the high-growth virus (A) or the MDV (B) amplification of appropriated seed vaccine viruses is made by amplification. selected viruses are cloned and sequenced for confirmation. the remaining class of vaccines consists of live-attenuated influenza viruses. the remaining class of vaccines consists of live-attenuated influenza viruses. the resulting IBV MDV grows efficiently at 25 \u00b0C (ca) but its growth is restricted at 37 \u00b0C (ts) the genetic changes in the MDV strains have been recently characterized. the Russian MDVs have been selected by growing len/57 in embryonated chicken eggs at lower (25 \u00b0C) temperatures. the genetic changes in the MDVs Len/17 have been identified. the second donor strain (Len/47) was obtained after a total of 47 passages. most influenza vaccines in the U.S. and Europe are egg-produced, formaldehyde-inactivated, then chemically disrupted with nonionic detergents after purification. the traditional method for generating reassortant virus is based on the coinfection of two influenza viruses in eggs. influenza PR8 replicates at high titers in eggs and cells. eggs are co-infected with PR8 and seasonal strains. selected viruses are cloned and sequenced for confirmation. the current LAIVs consist of the internal viral segments (PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M and NS) of an attenuated master donor virus (MDV) and the HA and NA viral segments from the selected seasonal virus strain. the resulting IBV MDV grows efficiently at 25 \u00b0C (ca) but its growth is restricted at 37 \u00b0C (ts) HA and NA viral segments can be unequally safe or immunogenic from year to year. the two Russian MDVs were originated from the same parental influenza strain Len/57). the genetic changes in the MDVs Len/17 have been identified. the majority of the currently licensed influenza vaccines that are made by biotechnology companies use fertilized chicken egg-based production technology. this process depends on the access to embryonated eggs, relies on the ability of influenza viruses to efficiently grow in eggs. the risk of egg contamination by avian pathogens or microbes represents a risk for the production of influenza vaccines. cell cultures can be cryopreserved and scaled up in bioreactors at any time. the majority of the currently licensed influenza vaccines are made by biotechnology companies. this process depends on the access to embryonated eggs, relies on the ability of influenza viruses to efficiently grow in eggs. mmalian cell lines offers several advantages over egg-based production. it allows faster and greater production capacity, improved availability of substrate for virus growth and eliminates reliance on the supply of embryonated chicken eggs. the use of adjuvants could also reduce vaccine dose, stretching antigen and vaccine supplies. the advent of reverse genetics and molecular engineering has transformed the influenza field. these technologies have been implemented to develop influenza vaccines [141] and to generate recombinant influenza viruses expressing foreign proteins as vaccine vectors [142,143,144] and harboring reporter genes to easily track viral infections. the Pol I promoter is species specific and was originally established for influenza rescue in human cells [135,140,149,154]. Currently, the Pol I promoters of different species have been identified. the ambisense plasmid is a bi-directional vector containing the human polymerase I promoter (hPol-I, white arrow) and the mouse Pol-I terminator (TI, white box) sequences. influenza polymerase complex replicates the vRNAs into complementary (c)RNAs. newly-synthesized vRNAs, together with the structural viral proteins result in the formation of new influenza viruses. IAV and IBV reverse genetics techniques are well established and commonly used in multiple research laboratories for different research purposes. researchers can mutate specific nucleotides in the influenza viral genome to elucidate the nature of regulatory sequences or the contribution of specific amino acids to the function of influenza viral proteins. ulent IAV have the potential to pose a greater human threat than many other BSL-3 and BSL-4 pathogens because of their efficient transmission and limited therapeutic options. traditional immunological approaches to identify the presence of IAV NAbs rely on the manipulation of live forms of viruses and need the use of special BSL conditions. novel approaches that allow the detection of viral NAbs without the use of live forms of IAVs and highly contained BSL laboratories would facilitate these serological assays. transfection of the eight ambisense plasmids leads to the rescue of the recombinant influenza viruses containing the six internal genome segments from the high-growth virus (A) or from the MDV (B) and two genome segments (the HA and NA encoding segments) from WHO candidate strain for their use as IIV (A) or LAIV (B) recombinant influenza viruses contain single or multiple mutations in the viral genome, which can be potentially implemented as novel or improved vaccine approaches. NS1 Truncated or Deficient Viruses as LAIVs Because of NS1\u2019s ability to hijack the host innate immune IFN-I response, a variety of potential vaccine strategies have been developed. IAVs with partial truncations in or deletions of viral NS1 protein are all attenuated in vitro and in vivo. these recombinant IAVs can induce a protective immune response upon a single intranasal vaccination in mice [177,179,180,181], horses [170], pigs [169,173,174], birds [167,175,176] and macaques [178], therefore, they represent excellent candidates as safe, the generation of recombinant viruses containing genes with deoptimized codons is now feasible [141,182] for influenza viruses, many regions in the viral genome cannot be altered because of their important role in viral replication and transcription (e.g., packaging signals), the presence of multiple overlapping ORFs (e.g., segments 7 and 8), etc. ized recombinant IAVs in other well-established animal models of influenza could lead to their implementation as LAIVs. sciIAVs based on their safety profile, ability to elicit protective humoral and cellular responses and protective effectiveness represent a feasible alternative to current influenza vaccines for the treatment of influenza viral infections. the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) protein of HPIV-3 or the fusion protein of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were able to induced Abs against the foreign polypeptides and reduced the viral load of the heterologous pathogen. removing the viral polymerase from sciIAVs limits their ability to express more polymerase during the single-cycle round of infection. a bivalent LAIV against influenza A/Vietnam/120320/04 H5N1 and A/Guinea fowl/Hong Kong/WF10/1999 H9N2 was generated using viral genome rearrangement. to overcome these concerns, a bivalent LAIV against influenza A/Vietnam/120320/04 H5N1 and A/Guinea fowl/Hong Kong/WF10/1999 H9N2 was generated. recombinant viruses with a rearranged M segment were affected or impaired in replication in vitro at nonpermissive temperatures. high viral titers were obtained at permissive low temperatures (33 \u00b0C). the rearrangement of the influenza viral genome can be used for the generation of safe, immunogenic and protective LAIVs. virus-like particles (VLPs) are morphologically similar to the virus. they present surface proteins in a highly immunogenic form. because they do not contain the viral genome, they are considered safer than viral vaccines. the advent of reverse genetics and molecular engineering has transformed the influenza field. these technologies have been implemented to develop influenza vaccines [141] and to generate recombinant influenza viruses expressing foreign proteins as vaccine vectors. pol I initiates and terminates transcription at defined promoter and terminator sequences. the Pol I promoter is species specific and was originally established for influenza rescue in human cells [135,140,149,154]. Currently, the Pol I promoters of different species have been identified. the ambisense plasmid is a bi-directional vector containing the human polymerase I promoter (hPol-I, white arrow) and the mouse Pol-I terminator (TI, white box) sequences. the influenza polymerase complex replicates the vRNAs into complementary (c)RNAs that serve as templates for the amplification of vRNAs. newly-synthesized vRNAs, together with structural viral proteins result in the formation of new influenza viruses. IAV and IBV reverse genetics techniques are well established and commonly used in multiple research laboratories for different research purposes. researchers can mutate specific nucleotides in the influenza viral genome to elucidate the nature of regulatory sequences or the contribution of specific amino acids to the function of influenza viral proteins. novel approaches to identify the presence of IAV NAbs rely on the manipulation of live forms of viruses and need the use of special BSL conditions. sciIAVs represent an excellent option for their implementation as safe, immunogenic and protective vaccines and/or vaccine vectors [69,144]. transfection of the eight ambisense plasmids leads to the rescue of the recombinant influenza viruses containing the six internal genome segments from the high-growth virus (A) or from the MDV (B) and two genome segments (the HA and NA encoding segments) from WHO candidate strain for their use as IIV (A) or LAIV (B) rescued viruses can be amplified and used as seed viruses for vaccine production. recombinant influenza viruses contain single or multiple mutations in the viral genome, which can be potentially implemented as novel or improved vaccine approaches.

IAVs with partial truncations in or deletion of viral NS1 protein are all attenuated in vitro and in vivo. these recombinant IAVs can induce a protective immune response upon a single intranasal vaccination in mice [177,179,180,181], horses [170], pigs [169,173,174], birds [167,175,176] and macaques [178], therefore, they represent excellent candidates as safe, immuno the generation of recombinant viruses containing genes with deoptimized codons is now feasible [141,182] for influenza viruses, many regions in the viral genome cannot be altered because of their important role in viral replication and transcription (e.g., packaging signals), the presence of multiple overlapping ORFs (e.g., segments 7 and 8), etc. recombinant IAVs in other well-established animal models of influenza could lead to their implementation as LAIVs in future vaccinations. sciIAVs based on their safety profile, ability to elicit protective humoral and cellular responses and protective effectiveness represent a feasible alternative to current influenza vaccines for the treatment of influenza viral infections. hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) protein of HPIV-3 or the fusion protein of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were able to induced Abs against the foreign polypeptides and reduced the viral load of the heterologous pathogen. removing the viral polymerase from sciIAVs limits their ability to express more polymerase during the single-cycle round of infection. a bivalent LAIV against influenza A/Vietnam/120320/04 H5N1 and A/Guinea fowl/Hong Kong/WF10/1999 H9N2 was generated using viral genome rearrangement. to overcome these concerns, a bivalent LAIV against influenza A/Vietnam/120320/04 H5N1 and A/Guinea fowl/Hong Kong/WF10/1999 H9N2 was generated. NS1 and NEP proteins (NS segment) were separated with the porcine teschovirus 1 (PTV-1) 2A autocleavage site. recombinant viruses with a rearranged M segment were affected or impaired in replication in vitro at nonpermissive temperatures. high viral titers were obtained at permissive low temperatures. virus-like particles (VLPs) are morphologically similar to the virus. they present surface proteins in a highly immunogenic form. they are considered safer than viral vaccines, yet still induce strong humoral and cellular immune responses. NS1-truncated influenza A and B viruses represent excellent LAIV candidates to prevent IAV infections. similar approach has been employed to develop attenuated IBVs with similar results. recombinant IAVs have been attenuated using a codon-pair or codon bias [182] deoptimization approach to decrease expression levels of the viral PB1, HA and NP [183,184] or NA and HA [184] or NS1 and NEP [182] have been generated. the ability of these recombinant IAVs containing codon bias deoptimized viral segments to replicate in eggs has not yet been evaluated. intranasal immunization with a single dose of sciIAVs elicited localized mucosal immune responses and recruitment of influenza-specific CD8 T-cells into the lungs of vaccinated animals [69,144] sciIAVs expressing foreign genes represent an excellent option for their implementation as bivalent vaccines. removing the viral polymerase from sciIAVs limits their ability to express more polymerase during the single-cycle round of infection. a single dose of a sciIAV where the viral PB2 has been removed was only as efficacious as an inactivated virus. there are safety concerns about the possibility of reassortment between the viral segments in the LAIV and circulating H5N1 strains. H9N2 NS1 and H5N1 HA were separated by the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) 2A autocleavage site to allow co-linear expression of both viral proteins. the rearranged H9N2 virus expressing the H5N1 HA was able to provide complete protection against challenge with A/Vietnam/1203/2004 H5N1. viruses with a reorganized M segment were able to confer better protection than a temperature-sensitive, LAIV PR8 virus [103,104,115,196]. these studies demonstrate that the rearrangement of the influenza viral genome can be used for the generation of safe, immunogenic and protective LAIVs. both the pandemic-subtype VLP and seasonal VLP induced NAbs and protected ferrets from lethal virus challenges. reverse genetics approaches to generate recombinant viruses have been described for representative family members of negative-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses. genetics approaches are reducing the potential time of recovery and production from months to weeks. they represent an excellent alternative for rapid development and implementation of LAIVs for the treatment of both seasonal and potentially pandemic influenza strains."}
