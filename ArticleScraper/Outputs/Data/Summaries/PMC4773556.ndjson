{"summary": "xenogeneic tissue treated by fixatives and preserving solutions is applied in the latter, whereas in the latter various synthetic materials were applied. a foreign body is literally placed into the blood flow, which constantly contacts with blood cells and surrounding tissues and could eventually cause inflammatory and, perhaps, autoimmune reactions. es were developed by analyzing 17 removed bioprostheses with average implant duration of 71.1 35.2 months. it is assumed that inadequately fixed tissues of porcine aorta resulting in retained antigenicity might be one of potential causes of developing inflammation. Surgical treatment and follow-up were done at the research institute for complex issues of cardiovascular diseases (Kemerovo, Russia) all patients underwent follow-up examination every six months after surgical correction. no differences in age and gender composition were found between patients and healthy volunteers. all persons enrolled were properly notified and signed an informed consent. flow cytometry analysis Stained samples were analyzed using hematology analyzer MEK-6400 (Nihon Kohden, Japan) a threshold was set to a forward-scatter (FSC) parameter to exclude cell debris. representative example of multicolor flow cytometry analysis after gating on CD4 or CD8 T cells from lymphocyte population. observations: nave (N), central memory (CM), effector memory (EM) and terminally differentiated CD45RA-positive effectors (TEMRA) anti-human CD45RA-FITC (cat.

UCHL1 antibody recognizing CD45R0 binds to memory T cells. both CD62L and CCR7 markers determine migration of CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ T cells from peripheral blood. lack of surface markers on effector T cells is accounted for by the fact that these cell subsets function within nonlymphoid tissues. central memory T cells are characterized by surface expression of CD45R0 instead of CD45RA. 131 patients with normally functioning transplanted kidney were examined. graft dysfunction (median age = 15 years) was documented. a 2-fold increased risk of developing graft dysfunction was observed. despite special treatment of biological material in graft tissues, quite a large amount of xenogeneic tissue antigens still remains. despite special treatment of biological material in graft tissues, quite a large amount of xenogeneic tissue antigens still remains (swine valve apparatus) myocardial ischemia and reperfusion in cytomegalovirus-seropositive patients lead to acute loss of antigen-specific, terminally differentiated CD8 T cells. authors conclude that considerable accumulation of TEMRA T cells suggests lifelong stimulation by protracted antigen exposure (viruses, other agents, or residual self-antigens) decreased relative and absolute number of central memory and nave CD3+CD8+ and increased number of CD45RA+CD62LCD3+CD8+ and CD3+CD4+ in patients with biological prosthesis were in the common trend regardless of the presence of any comorbidities."}
