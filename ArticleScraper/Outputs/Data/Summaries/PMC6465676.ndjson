{"summary": "the main causative agents identified in adult patients hospitalized for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) are viruses (in 27\u201330% of cases, the most common being rhinovirus, influenza and coronavirus) and bacteria (14\u201323% of cases, with a marked predominance of Streptococcus pneumoniae infections) the standard of care is antibiotic treatment. studies in animal models have highlighted the antimicrobial potency of flagellin against a wide variety of bacterial infections. these include intestinal infections caused by Salmonella enterica, Enterococcus faecium, Clostridium difficile, and Escherichia coli (8, 12\u201314), respiratory infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and S. pneumoniae (15, 16) antagonistic combination treatment has a smaller effect than the predicted cumulative value of the two components given separately. most studies of potentially synergistic antimicrobial agents are performed in in vitro systems such as bacterial cultures. strain 104491) was provided by the Institut Pasteur (Paris, France) it is a multidrug-resistant clinical isolate from a human bronchial secretion. it is resistant to amoxicillin (AMX), cefotaxime, doxycycline, erythromycin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, and cotrimoxazole (SXT) the influenza infection model was developed on the C57BL/6J mice. mice were infected intranasally with 30 l PBS containing 50 plaque-forming units (PFUs) of the pathogenic, murine-adapted influenza A virus strain Scotland/20/74. seven days later, mice were infected intranasally with 103 CFU in 30 l PBS. control animals received intranasal PBS alone. Mice were treated either intragastrically with AMX [5\u2013350 g of amoxicillin trihydrate (Sigma-Aldrich) or intraperitoneally with SXT. effect of treatment A was calculated as follows. total lung RNA was extracted with the NucleoSpin RNA Plus kit (Macherey-Nagel, Duren, Germany) and reverse-transcribed with the High-Capacity cDNA Archive Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) the cDNA was amplified using SYBR green-based real-time PCR on a Quantstudio 12K PCR system. cells were stained with anti-CD45-allophycocyanin-cyanine 7 (clone 30F11), anti-CD11b-Brilliant Violet 785 (clone M1.70), anti-Ly6C-peridinin chlorophyll protein-cyanine 5.5 (clone HK1.4), anti- Ly6G-phycoerythrin-cyanine 7 (clone 1A8), anti-CD11c-phycoerythrin- the antibodies were purchased from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA) or BioLegend (San Diego, CA) data were collected on a BD LSR Fortessa and analyzed with the BD FACSDiva software. working stocks were prepared as described previously (15, 28) fresh colonies grown on blood-agar plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C. for infection, working stocks were thawed and washed with sterile Dulbecco's Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS, Gibco, Grand Island, NY) for up to 3 months. the influenza infection model was developed in our laboratory on the C57BL/6J mice (29, 30) mice were infected intranasally with 30 l PBS containing 50 plaque-forming units (PFUs) of the pathogenic, murine-adapted influenza A virus strain Scotland/20/74. seven days later, animals were infected intranasally with 103 CFU of Sp3 in 30 l PBS. control animals were treated either intragastrically with AMX or intraperitoneally with SXT. effects on S. pneumoniae lung infection were quantified as percentage bacterial growth (%growth) the high-capacity cDNA archive kit was reverse-transcribed with the NucleoSpin RNA Plus kit (Macherey-Nagel, Duren, Germany) the cDNA was amplified using SYBR green-based real-time PCR on a Quantstudio 12K PCR system (Applied Biosystems) all the primers used in the study were validated for efficacy. choalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid samples were obtained after intratracheal injection of 3 1 ml of PBS supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS) lungs were perfused with PBS, excised and minced then digested in a solution of RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco) for 20 min at 37\u00b0C. red blood cells were removed using a lysis solution (Pharmlyse, BAL fluids were obtained by intratracheal injection of 2 1 ml PBS supplemented with protease inhibitors. Lungs were perfused with PBS and collected in T-PER reagent (Pierce) supplemented with protease inhibitors. debris were eliminated by centrifugation. flagellin was associated with the production of various innate immunity-related components, including chemokines (CXCL1, CXCL2, and CCL20), inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 and IL-6), and antimicrobial peptides (S100A9) mice were treated simultaneously with oral AMX (0.2 mg/kg) and intranasal flagellin FliC174400 (at doses of 0.4 g to 1 mg/kg, i.e., 1 RNA was extracted and reverse-transcribed. the relative expression level for each gene is expressed against that of the reference genes Actb and B2m and the reference condition AMX+PBS (arbitrarily set to a value of 1). 4% for flagellin + AMX 5 g and 1.2% for flagellin + AMX 40 g were much lower than the predicted %growth values. this experiment indicated strong synergy between intranasal flagellin and antibiotics in the treatment of a pneumococcal lung infection. antibiotic + PBS or antibiotic + FliC174400) vs. untreated mice (PBS) the predicted additive effect was calculated as % growth[antibiotic] % growth[flagellin]. similar experiments were carried out with the combination of the antibiotic SXT and flagellin. the strain failed to induce a lethal infection and other signs of disease (weight loss) in nave mice. it was assessed in mice that had already been exposed to the virus. mice were infected first with an intranasal, sublethal dose of H3N2 virus (50 PFU) and then infected 7 days later with 103 CFU of Sp3. mice were infection intranasally with 50 PFUs of H3N2 virus in 30 l of PBS followed 7 days later by intranasal administration of 103 Sp3. the values correspond to the median (range) CFU count. these results show a significant therapeutic advantage for the combination treatment, relative to standalone AMX or flagellin treatments. both AMX and AMX + flagellin treatments (either with 100 or 350 g of the antibiotic) were able to prevent systemic dissemination of the infection. comparison of %growth for the observed effect of the combination treatment vs. predicted additive effect. mice were collected 24 h post-infection, homogenized, and plated in serial dilutions onto blood agar plates to measure the bacterial load. for survival experiment, mice received a second dose of same treatment at 36 h post-Sp3 infection. Lungs were collected 2 h post-treatment for transcriptional analysis. despite the superinfection, flagellin still enhanced the transcription of Cxcl1, Cxcl2, Ccl20, Il1b, Il6 and S100a9 genes. we quantified the cytokine/chemokine production after 6 h of treatment. the blood cytokine production then diminished to an undetectable or very low level at 12 h. innate immune response to flagellin was effectively stimulated in the context of influenza immunological imprinting, the superinfection challenge, and the antibiotic treatment. Lungs (D) and BALs (E) were collected 12 h after treatment. neutrophils were defined as CD45+CD11b+Ly6G+ cells. line represents mean. dose of 2.5 g of flagellin FliC174400 was selected as a saturating immunostimulatory dose in the context of pneumococcal infection and lung inflammation. RNA was extracted and reverse-transcribed using quantitative PCR assays. the combination treatment induced a 10-fold relative decrease in bacterial counts for 5 g of AMX and a 82-fold relative decrease for 40 g of AMX. the nature of the interactions between flagellin and antibiotics was further analyzed by comparing the bacterial growth upon treatment. german mice (n = 12\u201320) were infected intranasally with 4 106 pneumococcus Sp1. the animals were treated 12 h later with the intragastric administration of amoxicillin (AMX; 5 or 40 g) (A,B), the intraperitoneal injection of cotrimoxazole that is the combination of the two antibiotics. the combination of the antibiotic SXT and flagellin was administered intraperitoneally at doses of 1 and 4 mg (40 and 160 mg/kg, respectively) the antibiotic was administered intraperitoneally at doses of 1 and 4 mg (40 and 160 mg/kg, respectively) flagellin significantly improved the therapeutic outcome of SXT treatment, as evidenced by CFU counts in the mice's lungs. mice were infected with 106 or 107 antibiotic-resistant pneumococcus Sp3 in 30 l of PBS or with 50 PFUs of H3N2 virus in 30 l of PBS followed 7 days later by intranasal administration of 103 Sp3. this bacterial superinfection induced significant weight loss and was 100% lethal. mice were treated with AMX alone, flagellin FliC174400 alone, or a combination of both compounds 12 h after the bacterial infection. bacterial counts were of 5,526- and 5,485-fold lower for the 100 and 350 g doses of antibiotic, respectively. comparison of %growth for the observed effect of the combination treatment vs. predicted additive effect (0.7 vs. 8.9% for AMX 100 g, and 0.02 vs. 0.9% for AMX 350 g) showed the synergy of the combination in the context of superinfection and antibiotic resistance. data from flagellin-treated and control (PBS-treated) mice were compared in a Mann-Whitney test (**p 0.01, and ***p 0.001) the effects on bacterial growth were quantified as the percentage of residual growth (%growth) in treated mice (AMX+PBS or AMX+FliC174400) delivery of flagellin in the lung of AMX-treated pneumococcal superinfection significantly increased levels of CCL20, CXCL1, CXCL2 and Tumor-necrosis factor (TNF) both in the lungs and in the BAL fluids compared with AMX+PBS-treated mice. production of IL-1 (or pro- IL-1) was detected only in the lung tissue and was increased in flagellin-treated mice. C57BL/6J mice were infected intranasally with 50 PFUs of H3N2 virus in 30 l of PBS and then 7 days later with 103 antibiotic-resistant pneumococcus Sp3 in 30 l of PBS. mice were treated 12 h after Sp3 infection with the antibiotic amoxicillin (AMX; 100 g, intragastric administration) data from AMX+flagellin group were compared to those of AMX+PBS group in a Mann-Whitney test. a combination of an antibiotic (AMX or SXT) and the local administration of the immunomodulatory biologic flagellin against respiratory infections caused by S. pneumoniae. flagellin intranasal administration specifically triggers TLR5-mediated transcription in the lungs from 2 to 30 h after a pneumococcus infection or from 7 to 14 days after an influenza infection (20) flagellin intranasal administration specifically triggers TLR5-mediated transcription in the lungs from 2 to 30 h after a pneumococcus infection. antimicrobial peptides (S100A9), cytokines (IL-1 and TNF) and chemokines (CCL20, CXCL1 and CXCL2) that were associated to epithelial responses are also upregulated after the administration of the combination treatment in the post-flu superinfection model. this suggests that the epithelium is also an important flagellin-specific driving force in the lung damaged by viral and bacterial infections. immunomodulators such as flagellin are of great interest because they activate a large number of antimicrobial immune mechanisms. the synergy between antibiotic and intranasal flagellin is independent of the antibiotic's mechanism of action. a model of infection by antibiotic-resistant bacteria would constitute an important tool for developing alternative anti-infectious approaches. ococcus Sp3 was unable to induce a lethal infection, even at high doses. infection creates a favorable environment for colonization and invasion by the strain. flagellin+AMX combination treatment effectively reduces bacterial burden caused by the strain in the lung. a useful generic alternative to the treatment of bacterial pneumonia. such strategy promotes multitarget inhibition through multiple innate immune effectors that should be more resistant to the development of resistance. flagellin's contribution to the lung antibacterial defenses at the molecular and cellular level."}
