{"summary": "the expanding knowledge in the field has particularly benefited our understanding of neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs) at the present time, it is widely acknowledged that templating (the basic mechanism generating protein misfolding, aggregation, deposit, and cell-to-cell transfer of certain pathogenic proteins) would be able to explain many features of the subclinical course and clinical manifestations of NDDs. in this third article we face a cumulative etiologic approach. we face a cumulative etiologic approach taking into account recent experimental data on transmissibility of multiple system atrophy. senile systemic amyloidosis (SSA), heart failure and myocardial infarction, aortic aneurism, narrow spinal channel Transthyretin wild-type \u2013 \u2013 25% 85 years \u2013 Medin arteriopathy. brain extracts of MSA cases transmitted synuclein proteinopathy to TgM83+/\u2013 mice. ic lateral sclerosis (ALS), fronto-temporal dementia (FTD), MSA, Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), lewy body disease (LBD), Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), rapid progressive dementia, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and Huntington\u2019s disease (HD) there were no language restrictions. a significantly high incidence of MND has recently been described in a young cohort of hGH recipients in the USA. potential host-to-cell induction of -synuclein degeneration from patients diagnosed with PD who received fetal/embryonic tissue grafts. the age of the host at the time of inoculation can be a strong determinant of the result. a similar feature is displayed by the male-mouse castration model of PD. MSA, an -synucleinopathy, has recently been transmitted in cell and mouse models. Prion models suggests that a lower prion protein inoculum correlates with a longer incubation period. slow subclinical and clinical progression might correspond to long incubation period from low inoculum exposures in experiments with animal models of prion diseases. normalized age-specific incidence, age-adjusted incidence, and median clinical disease duration of different sporadic protein-associated neurodegenerative disorders (sCNDDs) obtained either from reported data [amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), personally modified by Fang F, sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sRPNDd) notified as suspected sCJD in Spain for 1995\u20132011. high incidence of late-onset sCNDD might correspond to high attack rates from ubiquitous or widespread, tiny or low inoculum exposures. earlier-onset sCJD, ALS and earliest-onset sRPNDd may share prion-like entry or spread mechanisms. sCJD, LBD, AD, and AMD would present and perhaps share vascular protein deposits. sCNDD was misdiagnosed 4% of times as a vascular, non-autoimmune disease. sCJD was initially misdiagnosed 4% of times as a vascular, non-autoimmune disease, including stroke. sCJD was initially misdiagnosed 4% of times as a vascular, non-autoimmune disease, including stroke. driver 4 is related to a set of multiple variables, such as clinical signs and symptoms (diagnoses), behavioral patterns (health-related habits), and educational factors. this multifaceted and disperse panorama might be too wide for a satisfactory etiologically oriented approach. we propose that a complementary etiologic overview of sCNDD should incorporate goals and interpretations from other drivers, and driver 1 in particular, for late-life sCNDD. overlaps indicate risk-factor associations. Arrows indicate assumed direct causality. theory based on personal factors and the amyloid perspective on sCNDD suggests that a considerable part of the associations with late-life sCNDD might conceal confounding or reverse association. most of these associations are in part interpreted as confounding or reverse causality, and direct causality is assigned to a higher level shared by defined amyloid disorders. inconsistent findings for risk from blood transfusion have been reported. no positive association between neurosurgical procedures and CJD has been reported. the increased resistance to protein degradation in amyloid may provide some consistency with prion theory. scJD, ALS and some sRPNDds and MSA with onset below age 75\u201379 years are transmitted by routine surgery and transfusion of blood derivatives at juvenile age. a mutation in the PS2 gene (M239V) neutralizes the toxicity mediated by the Pertussis toxin. a mutation in the PS2 gene (M239V) neutralizes the toxicity mediated by the Pertussis toxin. a mutation in the PS2 gene (M239V) neutralizes the toxicity mediated by the Pertussis toxin. mechanisms for adaptation to humans seem to have occurred in the BP precursor, B. pseudopertussis, at an earlier time, taking place for BP by gene loss. the clear, saw-teeth, birth-cohort pattern seen for BP incidence and attributed to the periodic pattern of BP epidemics in Iceland suggests a similar effect of agents. BP may act through nasal and gastrointestinal epithelia. systemic action across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and vascular endothelium might be plausible. an impact on synuclein-related sCNDD may be suggested. the fact that some endocrine deficits, i.e., testosterone, are linked to risk of other endocrine disorders raises questions about a shared, unidentified etiologic cause affecting secretory systems. the amyloid perspective may serve as a reference for etiologic thinking. a hypothetical scenario modified from Figure 2 depicts a hypothetical etiologic scenario where different amyloid deposits shared by sCNDD determine late-life human pathology as a result of ER stressors or poor UPR. sporadic genetic forms may suggest a causal link between genetic CNDDs resulting from point mutations and the corresponding sCNDD forms. one might speculate that ontogenically speaking, sCNDD forms might be considered secondary to genetic ones in terms of numbers and biochemical similarity. a first key issue would be the potential of human sequences to make the hosted agent generate misfolded proteins. the role of E. coli might be mediated by gastrointestinal infections at a young age. in 2003, braak and associates proposed transneuronal transmission of pathologically altered -synuclein from the enteric nervous system to the brainstem. this process could be compatible with a proportion of cases being determined by other mechanisms. theory Curli from some human-adapted pathogens correspond to multiple potentially infective natural misfolded protein fibrils. these mechanisms may be shared by some angiopathies and T2DM exhibiting a similar driver. an essential condition for bacterial agents being candidates for HGT is that they themselves or their close ancestors must have been well adapted to human hosts. risk of PD increased with age at first whooping cough epidemic. surgery at juvenile age yielded the highest risk (OR 12.80; 95% CI 2.56\u201364.0) selective nigral neuronal toxicity in laboratory animals was highest for older rats and macaques. this was attributed to age-related neuronal pigmented deposit (relevant for accumulation of metabolic residue and advanced glycation end-products), which increases with age. in seeding experiments with APP mice, the age of the host at the time of inoculation can be a strong determinant of the result. a significantly high incidence of MND has recently been described in a young cohort of hGH recipients in the USA. potential host-to-cell induction of -synuclein degeneration from patients diagnosed with PD who received fetal/embryonic tissue grafts supported the inference of late-life sCNDD in fetal cells. a similar feature is displayed by the male-mouse castration model of PD. PD is only efficient when castration is performed on 4- to 6-week-old mice. a lower prion protein inoculum correlates with a longer incubation period. slow subclinical and clinical progression might correspond to long incubation period from low inoculum exposures. acute toxic effects followed by residual effects might better fit MPTP model patterns. normalized reported age-specific incidence and median age-at-onset of MSA in Iceland where plotted at a reported figure for other CNDDs. sporadic rapid progressive neurodegenerative dementia (sRPNDd) notified as suspected sCJD in Spain for 1995\u20132011. 85\u201389 years is equivalent to 85 years and older for sCJD, ALS, lewy body disease (LBD), Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), and sRPNDd. type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and vascular disease would be particularly seen in sCNDD (including sRPNDds) with incidence peaking after age 85 years. high incidence of late-onset sCNDD might correspond to high attack rates from ubiquitous or widespread, tiny or low inoculum exposures. the MSA incidence curve fitted curves and peak values intermediate between those for sCJD and PD. normalized age-specific incidence, age-adjusted incidence, and median clinical disease duration of different sporadic protein-associated neurodegenerative disorders. 85\u201389 years is equivalent to 85 years and older for sCJD, ALS, lewy body disease (LBD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) theory This driver might point to two distinct etiologic sCNDD forms differentiated by rapid progression, such as sCJD, ALS, and some sporadic rapidly-progressing neurodegenerative dementias. late-onset sCNDD may correspond to high attack rates from ubiquitous or widespread, tiny or low inoculum exposures. earlier-onset sCJD, ALS and earliest-onset sRPNDd may share prion-like entry or spread mechanisms. driver 3 reflects the effect of different genes, either separately or by interaction, determine the excess risk of several sCNDD. sCJD was initially misdiagnosed 4% of times as a vascular, non-autoimmune disease, including stroke, perhaps indicating the presence of a vasculopathy in sCJD. theory APOE4 interacts with etiologic environmental factors for several disorders, i.e., sporadic AD, LBD, AMD, vascular dementia, atherosclerosis. sCJD was initially misdiagnosed 4% of times as a vascular, non-autoimmune disease, including stroke. theory APOE4 interacts with etiologic environmental factors for several disorders, i.e., sporadic AD, LBD, AMD, vascular dementia, atherosclerosis, or other forms of vascular disease. a recent review addressing arterial hypertension, T2DM, hypercholesterolemia, physical activity, depression educational attainment, and smoking history emphasized the non-independent nature of such factors. authors estimated that, assuming causality underlying the associations, the AD attributable proportion reduced by a control of 10% of risk factors per decade would be 8.3% worldwide in 2050. a growing body of evidence suggests that platelet activation can mediate angiopathy in AD. a significant part of the associations with late-life sCNDD may conceal confounding or reverse association. most of these associations are in part interpreted as confounding or reverse causality. the unfolded protein response explains the reported associations for diverse conformational neurodegenerative, vascular degenerative and metabolic disorders (type 2 diabetes mellitus, T2DM). driver 4 contribution to theory is summarized as a potential switch of the roles attributed to a direct relationship between risk factors and sCNDD. most of these associations are in part interpreted as confounding or reverse causality, and direct causality is assigned to a higher level shared by defined amyloid disorders. confounding by surgically-linked blood transfusion was not controlled for. no positive association between neurosurgical procedures and CJD has been reported. infectivity from tissues such as liver and lung was shown. sCJD, ALS and some sRPNDds and MSA with onset below age 75\u201379 years are transmitted by routine surgery and transfusion of blood or blood derivatives at juvenile age. the association between age at first major whooping cough outbreak (MWCO) and PD constitutes an important observation in Iceland. human coexistence with commensal or pathogenic bacteria such as BP may have led to the interaction of bacterial aggregated proteins with aggregation-prone sequences from the host. mutation in the PS2 gene (M239V) neutralizes the toxicity mediated by the Pertussis toxin, suggesting that this toxin shares pathological mechanisms with some AD-mutant variants. B. pertussis infection damages nasal ciliated epithelium, a structure which transfers uranium to brain along olfactory nerve bundles. a similar effect of agents, other than airborne BP epidemic agents, is unlikely. a supplementary action through the gastrointestinal tract is not ruled out. inconsistent findings for risk from blood transfusion have been reported. no positive association between neurosurgical procedures and sCJD has been reported. inconsistent findings for risk have been reported. the increased resistance to protein degradation in amyloid may provide some consistency with prion theory. sCJD, ALS and some sRPNDds and MSA with onset below age 75\u201379 years are transmitted by routine surgery and transfusion of blood derivatives at juvenile age. BP infection in genetically susceptible young individuals might be proposed as an environmental driver for late-life sCNDD such as MSA, PD, LBD, and AD. despite the fact that undesired protein aggregation can have negative consequences for the cell, functional aggregation-prone regions and aggregates are essential for life. a mutation in the PS2 gene (M239V) neutralizes the toxicity mediated by the Pertussis toxin. seeding of naturally occurring protein fibrils from BP may be hypothesized as biological pluripotential mechanisms underlying BP infection as a causal factor of PD, AD, and diverse late-life sCNDD. mechanisms for adaptation to humans seem to have occurred in the BP precursor, B. pseudopertussis, at an earlier time. the expected key active element mediated by the human microbiome might be a natural fibril genetically related to human pathology. BP may act through nasal and gastrointestinal epithelia. systemic action across endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and vascular endothelium might be plausible. some associations of estrogen deficit may be considered to act outside the most susceptible lifetime points (driver 1), such as juvenile age. an impact on synuclein-related sCNDD may be suggested, since some animal studies implicate a role for estrogen in protecting the nigrostriatal dopaminergic functions. the amyloid perspective may serve as a reference for etiologic thinking. shared determinants of early amyloid deposits in myocardial or cerebral vessels are plausible. endocrine disorders such as estrogen or testosterone deficits might not yet have been identified as conformational disorders. castration, conducted no later than at 4\u20135 weeks, makes the male-mouse model support the etiologic role of testosterone deficit in PD. the fact that some endocrine deficits, i.e., testosterone, are linked to risk of other endocrine disorders raises questions about a shared, unidentified etiologic cause affecting secretory systems. driver 7. Invariant Ratio of sCNDD Incidence/Genetic CNDD Incidence, Across Entities This driver applies basically to genetic CNDDs determined by point mutations. the ratio, best known when defined by a proxy value, tends to increase due to the progressive improvement in the identification of such mutations. in a prior article, we proposed that the most relevant field of knowledge for driver 7 and assessment of the role of vectors in sCNDD might be gene transfer from human to bacterial human pathogens. the hypothesis would require an impact on sporadic atherosclerosis of mutations other than those seen in the TTR gene and Notch 1 present in Cerebral Autosomal-Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy. natural and synthetic amyloid fibrils induced AApoAII amyloidosis. this process could be compatible with a proportion of cases being determined by other mechanisms or entry sites such as the oral cavity. however, SB Prusiner suggests that the late onset of heritable NDDs may reflect a stochastic nature of prion formation. bacterial agents must have been well adapted to human hosts by integrating pathogenic DNA from different niches. infection by E. coli or coexistent with E. coli as part of the intestinal microbiome may induce diverse sCNDD, T2DM, and atherosclerosis, following an age-at-infection pattern. it has been estimated that more than 17% of the genetic material of E. coli (an enterobacterium hosted by humans; Lawrence and Ochman, 1997) is the result of horizontally transferred, protein-coding DNA over several million years. this process could be compatible with a proportion of cases being determined by other mechanisms or entry sites such as the oral cavity. the field of potential vectors, if restricted to well-adapted human pathogens, remains yet undefined but many are already sequenced. theory Curli from some human-adapted pathogens correspond to multiple potentially infective natural misfolded protein fibrils. these mechanisms may be shared by some angiopathies and T2DM exhibiting a similar driver. sCNDD, T2DM, and other late-life endocrine disorders constitute organ-limited amyloid disorders. conformational mimicry leads to misfolding of a limited number of proteins such as PrP, Langerhans Islet peptide, amyloid beta (A) and tau. ER stressors and UPR-related pathology may display complex relationships, i.e., as seen for VRF, late-life sCNDD, atherosclerosis, and T2DM. incorporation of drivers 5,6, and 7 in the model seen in Figure 3 would result in a comprehensive etiologic model presented in Figure 4. the validity of human drivers, i.e., age-at-exposure related susceptibility, may be tested in toxic animal models of NDD. a human driver-1-related model is that which best fits the study of arteriosclerosis and diabetes-accelerated arteriosclerosis. genetically-modified, cell and animal models of AD, PD, FTD, and ALS are all based on the mutations described in the familial NDD forms2. a research goal in the experimental model context might be the identification of key elements underlying an environmentally modified, potential effect of human genes. specific attempts to combine population and clinical cohorts/registries able to trace human events might be a priority. animals targeting AD, tauopathies, and ALS are mainly based on transgenic methodologies. animals may exhibit a number of limitations, mimicking phenotypic variants of AD and other sCNDD1. sporadic forms of sporadic forms of CJD, sRPNDd, MND, MSA, LBD, FTD, PD, AD, and AMD can be identified by drivers. a minimum size or pooled study would be required for substantial incidence counts of late-life NDDs. study populations of this nature are to be found in Iceland, new Caledonia, San Miguel in the Azores. it might be advantageous to study the synergistic effects observed between environmental exposures and selected recognized genetic risk factors for different entities. populations with registered data on both sRPNDd and sCJD tend to be large countries where CJD surveillance has been conducted for decades. controls randomly selected from annual population registries are paramount for studies on risk from medical procedures. populations exposed to agents producing point-source epidemics have been those that are geographically isolated with ancient native populations 200,000.
