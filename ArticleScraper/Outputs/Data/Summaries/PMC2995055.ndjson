{"summary": "frameshifting is a translational recoding mechanism that allows the synthesis of multiple proteins from a single mRNA. a certain proportion of the ribosomes is forced to move one or two nucleotides backwards (\u20131 or 2 frameshift) or forwards (+1 or +2 frameshift) as a result the stop codon of the first open-reading frame is bypassed. despite recent progress (12\u201314), the exact mechanism by which a downstream RNA structure stimulates 1 frameshifting remains unclear. the current view is that the downstream RNA element forms a physical barrier that causes a fraction of ribosomes to stall in their translocation step. this tension is relieved by realignment of A-site and P-site tRNAs in the 5\u2032-direction. this pseudoknot differs from the viral pseudoknot by having G2C18-to-CG, C10G32-to-UA, G20-to-C and deletion of GCU between C24 and A25 substitutions. the 3D model of the NMR pseudoknot (PDB 1E95); L2 bases, magenta; S1 and S2 base pairs in cyan. plasmid pSF103 was obtained by a two-step PCR mutagenesis procedure. mutants SF202\u2013206 and SF209\u2013211 were constructed as follows. first the entire BglII-NcoI fragment was replaced by two short complementary oligonucleotides. plasmid pSF208 was opened at the BglII and SpeI sites. oligonucleotides SF226 (5\u2032-GATCTTAATACGACTCACT-ATAGGGCTCCTATAGTGTATTAA-3\u2032) and SF227 (5\u2032-CTAGTTTCCCTGAGCCCTATA-GTGTATTAA-3\u2032) were inserted. this yielded pSF212, which was digested with SpeI and NcoI bSF200\u2013SF350 series were constructed in a modified version of the SF103 construct. in vitro transcription DNA templates were linearized by BamHI digestion and purified by successive phenol/chloroform extraction and column filtration. in vitro translation Reactions contained 4 l of RNA solution, 4.5 l of reticulocyte lysate (Promega), 1 l of 35S methionine (ICN, in vitro translation grade), 0.5 l of 1 mM amino acids (Met) and were incubated for 60 min at 28\u00b0C. frameshifting control was constructed by changing the slippery sequence to UUUAAGC. in the in-frame control a C-residue was added directly downstream of this heptamer. all constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. plasmid pSF208 was opened at the BclI and SpeI sites. sets of complementary oligonucleotides corresponding to mutants SF202\u2013206 were inserted. this yielded pSF212, which was digested with dideoxy sequencing. SF103, SF206b Wild-type 100 100 SF105 C20G 121 SF106 C20A 151 SF107 C19G 42 SF108 A28U 58 SF109 A28C 27 SF210 A28G 63 SF111 C24U 98 SF112 C24G 91 SF113 C24A 124 SF114 C19iUUU 88 SF202 C24del 100 69 SF203 C5U, G bSF200\u2013SF350 series were constructed in a modified version of the SF103 construct. in vitro transcription DNA templates were linearized by BamHI digestion and purified by successive phenol/chloroform extraction and column filtration. frameshift percentages were calculated as the amount of 1 frame product divided by the sum of 0 and 1 frame products. in vivo assay Pseudoknot mutants were cloned in KpnI/BamHI digested pDUAL-HIV(0) (4). the SRV-1 pseudoknot (26) revealed a number of interesting features. mutations were introduced in these regions of the pseudoknot. their frameshifting capacity was measured in rabbit reticulocyte lysates. changes in L2 C20 For NMR purposes the wild-type G-residue at this position was replaced by a C (26) an adenosine at this position (SF106) was even more beneficial for frameshifting. the presence of C24 in loop L2 does not affect frameshifting. adenosine at this position slightly enhanced frameshifting activity. a pyrimidine seems too small to fulfil these interactions. A28 A28 is a key nucleotide in stabilizing the pseudoknot fold by anchoring L2 to the S1/S2 junction through formation of two hydrogen bonds with the 2\u2032-hydroxyl group of G14. replacement by U (SF108) or G (SF210) resulted in almost 2-fold decrease whereas a C (SF109), though having a similarly positioned N1 and amino groups as an adenosine, resulted in 4-fold drop in frameshift changes in S1 G1\u2013C19 A previous sequence comparison showed that most frameshifter pseudoknots start with a 5\u2032G\u2013C3\u2032 base pair (30). Changing this base pair to C\u2013G (SF209) affected frameshifting efficiency somewhat (73%) this confers to the general notion that helix stability is an important determinant in frameshifting. base pair mutant was 3-fold less active in frameshifting than parent SF206 pseudoknot. mutation caused almost 4-fold drop in frameshifting activity. mutation of base pair to U\u2013A caused a 4-fold drop in frameshifting activity. SF224 is a slightly better shifter than SF206 (1.11-fold) with an absolute frameshift frequency of 24% it still cannot be considered a supershifter. previous experiments with SRV-1 pseudoknot mutants yielded better shifters (31) SF350 showed 8.4% frameshifting, a 2.5-fold drop compared to SF206. in SF348 most of the base triples are presumably lost and a 3-nt loop crossing the minor groove of stem S1 may not be sterically and thermodynamically favorable. a large loop may lead to a longer refolding time of the pseudoknot once a ribosome has passed through this structure. Mutations were made in the pseudoknot of plasmid SF404. this 1.7-fold increase is very similar to the previously reported increase from 23 to 40% in vitro for changing the slippery sequence (28). the only exception seems to be the effect of enlarging L2 which is consistently more detrimental for frameshifting in vivo than in vitro. in the latter mutant two additional base pairs might be formed with the 5\u2032 single-stranded sequence (AU and GU) these are probably melted when the ribosome is stalled over the slippery sequence. replacement with C or U decreased the relative frameshifting activity to 60 and 63%, respectively. the third hydrogen bond is between the N1 and amino group of G4. the pyrimidine ring is too far away to form interactions with the 2\u2032OH of G14. the lower frameshift activity of the C-mutant could also be caused by formation of a base pair with G14. single-nucleotide mutations in L2 show the functional, critical importance of the A26:G4\u2013C16 and A28:C5\u2013G15 triples that were previously identified by NMR spectroscopy. a construct was designed with a pyrimidine-rich L2 sequence CUCUCGUG (SF229, \u2018L2-mut\u2019) that included the wild-type G-residue at this position was replaced by a C (26) a guanine cannot substitute for the triple interaction with the C2\u2013G18 base pair. replacement with C or U decreased the relative frameshifting activity to 60 and 63%, respectively. a pyrimidine seems too small to fulfil these interactions. the relatively high frameshifting activity, 70% of the A26G pseudoknot, suggests that stacking properties assisted by the ribose interaction may be more important than formation of the zipper motif itself. however, a considerable clash between its N1 and the G4 amino group can be expected. a construct was designed with a pyrimidine-rich L2 sequence CUCUCGUG (SF229, \u2018L2-mut\u2019) that included the A21U, C24U, A26G and A28G mutations. a previous sequence comparison showed that most frameshifter pseudoknots start with a 5\u2032G\u2013C3\u2032 base pair (30) this confers to the general notion that helix stability is an important determinant in frameshifting. G4\u2013C16 This base pair is involved in a base triple with A26. mutation of which had quite some impact on frameshifting. Changing G4\u2013C16 into A\u2013U (SF204) is predicted to result in the loss of one hydrogen bond (G24N2H\u2013A26N1), similar to changing A26 to G (SF218). Changing G1\u2013C19 into an A\u2013U base pair (SF211) or a G\u2013G mismatch (SF107) reduced the efficiency even further to about 40%, again emphasizing the role of S1 stability. Previously, changing G3\u2013C17 in the wild-type pseudoknot to A\u2013U resulted in an almost 5-fold drop in frameshifting (31). C5\u2013G15 This pair forms a triple interaction with U27. mutation of which had at most a one-third lower frameshifting activity. this interaction is not expected to change by mutating it to a U\u2013A bp (SF205) SF224 is a slightly better shifter than SF206 (1.11-fold) with an absolute frameshift frequency of 24% it still cannot be considered a supershifter. previous experiments with SRV-1 pseudoknot mutants yielded better shifters (31) SF350 showed 8.4% frameshifting, a 2.5-fold drop compared to SF206. most of the base triples are presumably lost and a 3-nt loop crossing the minor groove of stem S1 may not be sterically and thermodynamically favorable. with SF350, containing the 27-nt L2, the situation is different. mutations were made in the pseudoknot of plasmid SF404. the only exception seems to be the effect of enlarging L2. this is consistently more detrimental for frameshifting in vivo than in vitro. deletion of the bulging C24 from the loop L2 did not affect frameshifting significantly in vitro and in vivo. this adds to the notion that this nucleotide can be safely squeeze out to allow stacking of adenosines in L2. other frameshifter pseudoknots also have a cytosine flanked by adenines in L2. ribosomes first sense bottom of stem S1 we would expect base triples to be present at the bottom of the stem or in the 5\u2032 end of L2. however, most triples are found near the 3\u2032 end of L2 close to the junction with S2. a pseudoknot trapped in the mRNA entry tunnel resists mechanical unwinding. ribosomes can stall for seconds to minutes without frameshifting to occur. mechanical resistance to RNA unfolding is the key to ribosomal frameshifting. but how the ribosome exactly \u2018chokes\u2019 on such a structure is far from being understood. slow-folding pseudoknots limit the activity of the Hepatitis Delta virus ribozyme (40). thus the efficiency of a frameshifter pseudoknot may not be solely dictated by its stability."}
