{"summary": "model is set up to allow for an efficient simulation of many adaptation waves simultaneously in progress. the habitat is modeled by a lattice with periodic boundary conditions. each lattice site records the genetic identity of the locally dominating clone. natural selection is implemented so that the clone at site i is replaced by one of the neighboring clones j with a probability proportional to its fitness, Wj. this replacement rule generates adaptation waves traveling at an average velocity c = 2 m W with a migration rate of m = 1 4, consistent with the classical Fisher\u2013Kolmogorov wave theory. we find the power laws V 1/2 in linear habitats (A) and V 1/3 in planar habitats (B) simulations were carried out for mean selection coefficients s0 = 0.025, 0.05, and 0.1. we also varied the type of adaptation wave (deterministic/noisy) and the distribution of fitness effects. adaptation speed saturates at a limiting value Vmax. for small habitat sizes, the adaptation speed approaches a limiting value. both the crossover scale and the adaptation speed limit depend on the selection advantage s0 of beneficial mutations. bLd at which beneficial mutations appear depends on the dimension d of the habitat. the latter depends on the dimension d of the habitat (d = 1 and d = 2 for a linear and a planar habitat, respectively) the scaled adaptation speed V/V0 with V0 = s0c0/L should be a unique function of the scaled mutation rate /0 with 0 = c0/(2s0Ld+1) the resulting scaling plots for linear and planar habitats are shown in Figure 3. the effect is stronger in the clonal interference than in the periodic selection regime. we have measured fixation times and fitness correlations in linear habitats as a function of habitat size. recombination allows us to combine beneficial mutations arising on different genetic backgrounds. genetic and spatial mixing speed up adaptation. effects of recombination on adaptation speed in a linear habitat. simulations were carried out with s = const., s0 = 0.25, = 3.125 105. long-range migration allows clones to replicate themselves at different locations. a clone that has led to a second seed by means of long-range migration will grow twice as fast as a clone with only one seed. a third seed triples the growth rate, etc. the adaptation speed is linear in the habitat size, which indicates that adaptation is limited by the occurrence of mutations. the adaptation speed is linear in the habitat size, which indicates that adaptation is limited by the occurrence of mutations. the \u201cspeed limit\u201d Vmax depends on the parameters, in particular mutation rates and Fisher wave speed. the condition for clonal interference can be determined by comparing two important timescales. the second timescale is the waiting time tmut for a new beneficial mutation to become established. the factor 2 s 0 2 L d on the right-hand side is the rate at which beneficial mutations accumulate in the absence of clonal interference. if mutations arise sequentially, each established mutation also reaches fixation; hence F 1 for small habitats, L Lc. the fitness effects of new mutations were drawn from an exponential and a gamma distribution. this indicates that the prefactors of the adaptation speed depend on the tails of the distribution. large distributions tend to yield larger adaptation speeds, apparently because they will give rise to the sampling of unusually large-s clones that outcompete average-s clones. recombinants are produced at a rate r per site from two (haploid) individuals randomly selected from the nearest neighborhood in the parent generation. mutations to both sides of the recombination point are exchanged between the two chromosomes, forming the recombinant genotype. spatial mixing is implemented so that any given clone competes at a small rate ml with a randomly chosen clone rather than with its immediate neighbor. long-range migration has no effect on the periodic selection regime, because it does not change the limiting supply of beneficial mutations. the linear regime of periodic selection is extended to a larger parameter range as the long-range migration rate is increased. for sufficiently large habitat sizes, clonal interference also occurs in the presence of long-range migration. however, the number of simultaneously competing clones is reduced due to the faster sweeps. clonal interference occurs when the habitat size is larger than a characteristic size Lc. the interference scale Lc defines a crossover, but measures the typical distance an adaptation wave travels freely before it collides with another wave that arose independently of the first one. two clones (red and blue) share interfaces until recombination occurs. a more fit recombinant arises (violet); another recombinant arises later (yellow and violet result in the green mutant). a range of cell densities between 1 and 1000 per square cell diameter yields a mutation supply rate that lies within the range of 106 and 101 per square cell diameter. we estimate a deterministic Fisher wave speed c0 in the range of 0.1\u201310 cell diameters per generation by assuming microbes in dense colonies disperse between 1 and 100 cell diameters per generation. Vmax is proportional to 1/2 and 1/3 in linear and planar habitats. this scaling was shown to hold for various distributions of fitness effects. both the speed limit and the robust power law scaling with the mutation rate are in stark contrast. spatial mixing is a very efficient alternative mechanism of mitigating clonal interference in structured populations. spatial mixing increases the growth rate of fitter clones and thus lowers fixation times. this increases the likelihood for beneficial mutations to occur sequentially on the same background, and therefore clonal interference is attenuated. clonal interference is widespread in biofilms and leads to markedly different adaptation dynamics than in well-mixed populations. spatial mixing is highly beneficial in structured populations as it relaxes clonal interference. this condition is equivalent to K b log ( K s 0 ) 1, (A3) which is equivalent to K m / s 0 U b 1. this condition defines an upper bound for the mutation rate, given by U b s 0 / m K. to avoid numerical overflow we compute the logarithmic fitness. the speed of adaptation on the population is defined by the rate of change of logarithmic fitness; i.e., V = log [ W ( t + 1 ) / W ( t ). the fitness difference W = Wl Wr defines a velocity according to the wave velocity relation c(W) the offspring is picked from the two immediate neighbors in the parent generation at t. for the deterministic Fisher wave speed the migration rate is m = 1/4. for the noisy Fisher wave speed the product of migration rate and population density is m = 1. the fixation probability is given by 2s for small selective advantages s. mutations fixate with probability 2s. we first measured the fixation probability for a given velocity, Pfix(c) the resulting fixation probability approximates the required fixation probability of 2s well for small s. recombination occurs at a rate r per site and generation. sites occupied by the wild type are shown in white and sites occupied by advantageous mutations are shown in red. two parent genomes are selected from the parent generation. we measured the velocity relation c(W) resulting from this algorithm. the relation matches the behavior expected from a deterministic Fisher wave, c = k W, with a prefactor k = 1 4. the fixation probability assumes the expected behavior of 2s for small selective coefficients. this representation is valid when (i) clones within the deme do not interfere and (ii) the growth of a clone within the deme generates expanding clonal waves. this condition is equivalent to K U b log ( K s 0 ) 1, which\u2014up to loga. simulations are started with a population devoid of genetic variation. the selective fitness advantage s of a mutation is chosen to be either constant or drawn from a distribution with mean value s0. an auxiliary lattice is used every half generation, shifted by half a lattice site. the fitness difference between the left and right sites is then defined as W = Wl Wr. the lattice formed by full and half generations forms a hexagonal lattice in space\u2013time coordinates. the genome to be passed on to site i in the offspring generation t + 1 2 descends from either the left or the right immediate neighbor in the parent generation t. the probabilities must sum to unity; i.e., pl + pr = 1. fixation of a mutant with a small fitness effect s is equal to 2s. the fixation probability is the same for spatially structured populations. this result was later confirmed in simulations of spatially structured habitats. recombinants are produced at a rate r per site and generation from two (haploid) individuals randomly selected from the nearest neighborhood in the parent generation. recombinants are formed from the parental genotypes A and B by one-point recombination. the parent chromosomes are paired and a point xexc is randomly chosen by which both chromosomes are split. planar habitats are represented by a hexagonal planar lattice. an auxiliary shifted lattice is used every half generation. the offspring site inherits genomes from the three surrounding sites. this means that we need to compute three probabilities pk = Wk/(W1 + W2 + W3). the fixation probability was measured in a smaller habitat with L = 256. fewer results are available regarding the beneficial mutation rate U (per generation and per genome) and their selective coefficients. effect of clonal interference would lead to an underestimate of and overestimate of the average effect of beneficial mutations. more recent studies suggest that the rate of beneficial mutations is much higher. tfix tmut allows us to determine a characteristic population size above which clonal interference is expected. for a nonstructured population, the waiting time for successful mutations is t m u t ( N U ) 1, (D1) where the fixation probability is = 2s0. the area of a petri dish occupies A = R2 109 square cell lengths. the population in this experiment grows to a final size of Nf = 1010. however, microbial colonies on rich medium can certainly grow to larger thicknesses. fewer results are available regarding the beneficial mutation rate U (per generation and per genome) some studies suggest mutation rates as low as U 109 or 108 per genome per generation. studies were carried out for large effective population sizes (Ne 107) that had not been previously exposed to the used growth environment. but under such circumstances, one expects that supply rate NU is rather high. not taking into account effects of genetic drift and clonal interference would lead to an underestimate of and overestimate of the average effect of beneficial mutations. for a nonstructured population, the waiting time for successful mutations is t m u t ( N U ) 1, (D1) where the fixation probability is = 2s0. the crossover condition becomes the implicit equation 2NU log(Ns/2) 1. the population in this experiment grows to a final size of Nf = 1010. for a densely packed population of bacteria, it is reasonable to assume that X is at least of the order of 1 cell length and at most of the order of 10 cell lengths. we find a lower bound of cmin = 0.1 and for the upper bound cmax = 10 cells per generation. we find the following upper and lower bounds for the interference scale."}
