{"summary": "the P\u2013CH2\u2013O\u2013CHR\u2013 fragment in acyclic nucleoside phosphonates was replaced by the P\u2013CH2\u2013HN\u2013C(O)\u2013 residue. the phosphonates were synthesized in good yields by coupling the straight chain of -aminophosphonates and nucleobase-derived acetic acids with EDC."}
