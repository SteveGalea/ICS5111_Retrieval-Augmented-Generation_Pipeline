{"summary": "autophagy is a conserved cell biological pathway that delivers cytoplasmic components to lysosomes. this process involves formation of double membrane autophagosomes, which fuse with lysosomes to degrade the sequestered cargo. autophagy interacts with the innate antiviral immune response (5\u20137). phagic vesicle membrane can promote recruitment of LC3 (Atg8) to autophagic vesicles. atg5 plays a role in regulating IFN immune and inflammation responses (7). outbreaks of viral diseases have caused heavy economic losses in the grouper aquaculture industry. bioinformatic analysis Based on several expressed sequence tag sequences of EcAtg5 from the grouper spleen transcriptome (23), primers (Table 1) were designed to amplify the full-length open reading frame (ORF) of EcAtg5.

EcAtg5 overexpression increased the level of LC3-II. pcDNA3.1-3 HA-EcAtg5 and the empty vector were transfected into GS cells. LC3-II (the lipidated form) level was higher in cells transfected with EcAtg5. EcAtg5 knockdown reduced the LC3-II level (Figure 4B), suggesting that EcAtg5 might activate autophagy by promoting LC3 lipidation in GS cells. cytopathic effect (CPE) induced by SGIV infection evoked at 24 h. CP and RdRp were determined using qRT-PCR. one-way ANOVA was used to evaluate the variability between treatment groups. effects of silencing EcAtg5 on SGIV and RGNNV replication were also studied. expression of EcAtg5 Decreased the Interferon Immune Response and Pro-Inflammatory Cytokines. transcription levels of host immune factors and pro-inflammatory cytokines were detected using qRT-PCR. expression levels of interferon related cytokines and effectors were decreased in EcAtg5 overexpressing cells compared with control vector transfected cells. EcAtg5 overexpression suppressed the promoter activity of these genes. the results showed that siRNA-mediated Atg5 knockdown increased the promoter activity of three reporter genes. the effects of EcAtg5 on NF-B response promoter, IFN promoter, and ISRE promoter activity were measured. GS cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1-3 HA or EcAtg5. Ectopic expression of EcAtg5 clearly inhibited the G1/S transition. percentages of pcDNA3.1-3 HA and EcAtg5 overexpressing cells were 65.34 and 72.28%. phylogenetic analysis was carried out using the boot-strapped neighbor joining method. EcAtg5 was constitutively expressed in all the analyzed tissues in healthy grouper. expression levels of EcAtg5 were significantly increased in SGIV infected cells. GS cells were transfected with pEGFP-C1 or pEGFP-EcAtg5. after 24 h, fixed cells were stained with DAPI and imaged by fluorescence microscopy. LC3 lipidation is used as a faithful marker of autophagy activation. the level of LC3-II was higher in cells transfected with EcAtg5 compared with control cells. EcAtg5 knockdown reduced the LC3-II level. EcAtg5 overexpression increased SGIV gene transcription. expression levels of CP and RdRp were determined using qRT-PCR. effects of silencing EcAtg5 on SGIV and RGNNV replication also studied. the level of SGIV-MCP or RGNNV-CP was detected by Western blot, and -actin was used as the internal control. overexpression of EcAtg5 Decreased the Interferon Immune Response and Pro-Inflammatory Cytokines. host IFN associated genes were determined using qRT-PCR. one-way ANOVA was used to evaluate the variability between treatment groups. expression levels of proinflammatory factors were determined using qRT-PCR. the promoter activity was measured using the luciferase reporter gene assay. one-way ANOVA was used to evaluate the variability between treatment groups (*p 0.05, **p 0.01) Effects of EcAtg5 Overexpression on cell cycle progression Mammalian Atg5 plays a causal role in regulating cell cycle progression. the role of Atg5 gene in zebrafish neurogenesis and organogenesis has been reported. the formation of the Atg5-Atg12 conjugate may depend on Atg5 protein generation and its splicing. however, little has been reported about the role of Atg5 in virus replication. phagy can be induced by a variety of factors, including starvation, reactive oxygen species, endoplasmic reticulum stress, microbial invasion and so on. we detected the expression of EcAtg5 under the stimulation of two viruses. this suggests that RGNNV infection may significantly induce autophagy activity to facilitate its proliferation. g5-Atg12 conjugate interacts directly with the mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) through the N-terminal caspase recruitment domain (CARD), resulting in inhibition of type I IFN production. overexpression of EcAtg5 in grouper cells decreased expression levels of several interferon related cytokines or effectors. a key autophagy related gene (EcAtg5) was cloned. the role of EcAtg5 in autophagy, innate immunity, and cell cycle was investigated. a link between autophagy, innate immunity, and cell cycle was investigated. conflict of interest Statement The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
