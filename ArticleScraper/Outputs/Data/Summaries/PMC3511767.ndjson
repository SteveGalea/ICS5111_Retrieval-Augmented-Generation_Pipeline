{"summary": "we quantified the rates of nonsynonymous (dN) and synonymous (dS) substitutions across the branches of maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic trees from 184 viral isolates. the relative difference in dN and dS indicates the selection pressure exerted on genes, with dN/dS > 1 (or equivalently, dN dS > 0) indicative of positive selection. site G493 switched nine times between six different amino acid residues. G357 underwent seven flip-flop substitutions between valine and isoleucine. L1620 switched repeatedly between glycine and four other residues. positive selection was detected in all of the putative functional domains except region II. positive selection was detected in all of the putative functional domains except region II (Table S1). positive selection was detected in all of the putative functional domains except region II. in 11 of 13 RV lineages, we detected significant signatures of viral population growth. in most of these lineages, reconstructions of past demographic histories revealed similar three-stage processes of host shifts. the effective number of infections is the product of the effective population size (Ne) and the generation time between infections (). the date of cross-species transmission was estimated from the consensus bat RV phylogeny. we hypothesized that viruses might establish more quickly in new hosts. longer lag phases might correspond to more extensive evolutionary change (7). the relationship was significant when we considered only the number of changes in L (: 95% CI = 14.02\u2013116.54) but was less supported by data from G alone (: 95% CI = 8.86\u201381.03) but a negative relationship emerged between lag time and the number of selected sites in G (: 95% CI = 107.96 to 5.33) models with positively selected sites alone provided a significantly better fit than models including either of the other substitution types according to Akaike's information criterion. differences in predictive power reflected the absence of strong correlations between the numbers of positively selected and synonymous substitutions (r = 0.56; P = 0.071) or NPN substitutions (r = 0.50; P = 0.12), suggesting positively selected changes do not simply and necessarily accumulate as a function of time. positively selected codons in N, G, and L only experienced selection on 0.8%, 4.6%, and 2.6% of branches in their respective phylogenies. positive selection in the bat RV phylogeny is consistent with more pervasive selection over time. positive sites were found within the first 160 codons of N. positive selection was restricted to G and L, where substitutions occurred almost exclusively on the tips of the tree. in ectodomain, nine positively selected sites were found in the ectodomain. positive selection was detected in all of the putative functional domains except region II. ancestral state reconstruction was used to assign host states and genetic changes to the internal branches of a consensus phylogeny of RV estimated from a joint Bayesian analysis of the N, G, and L genes. overlaid histograms show the posterior distributions of the transition times between historical (pregrowth) and contemporary demographic periods from the two-epoch models. the vertical axis for histograms was varied across graphs to enable comparable visualization. the epizootic lag time for virus A is T0 \u2013 T2, when including inferred ancestral-host states. we tested the relationship between the extent of molecular adaptation and delays in viral establishment. greater numbers of amino acid changes in G and L were associated with longer delays until enzootic viral establishment. a negative relationship emerged between lag time and the number of selected sites in G. gray lines show 2,000 model predictions using random draws from the posterior distribution of epizootic lag time for each viral lineage. the inset histogram shows the distribution of the slope parameter from the iterated models, with 95% limits shaded in black. the more abundant synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions largely determined the branch lengths that defined the epizootic lag time in this analysis. previous studies found mixed evidence for positive selection in some regions of G. but our study also implicated L in the establishment of new RV reservoirs. dN was elevated marginally at the site 333 of the ectodomain. substitutions away from arginine and lysine can reduce or eliminate pathogenicity, disrupt cell-to-cell spread and block pathways to penetrate the central nervous system. selection was common on internal viral regions that have minimal interaction with the host environment. avian H5N1 influenza viruses showed alternative sets of amino acid changes allowed airborne transmission among ferrets. this suggests disparate genetic routes to a similar infection phenotype. replication might be manipulated through numerous processes occurring across the viral genome. despite using the best available methods and explicitly incorporating uncertainty into our statistical models, our analyses of epizootic lag time faced several challenges. we addressed this by using statistical cutoffs in our assignment of ancestral-host states to branches, assigning the dates of cross-species transmission based on different scenarios, and by including all known bat RV lineages. evolutionary routes to viral establishment shared few steps in common. variation in evolutionary routes to viral establishment was the best predictor of the duration of adaptive periods and, therefore, the speed of viral emergence. final datasets comprised 30 viral lineages for N (184 unique sequences), 26 lineages for G (68 unique sequences) and 23 lineages for L (48 unique sequences). the tree with the highest log likelihood was used in analyses of selection after removing the outgroup. to identify bat species in which positive selection occurred, we used Bayesian phylogenetic ancestral host\u2013state reconstruction. we extended a previously published analysis by allowing host shifts to occur asymmetrically between host species, by including viral lineages from Central and South American bat species. each alignment was treated as a separate data partition, allowing us to estimate a consensus evolutionary history of bat rabies and the most probable host states along branches. a single exception was made for the virus maintained by Desmodus rotundus (DrV), which had a complex demographic history that was poorly captured by the parametric models relative to the BSP. we estimated the beginning of the growth phase using parametric two-epoch models, characterized by two historical periods of constant but distinct viral population sizes and a parameter describing the transition time between them. additional RV N (n = 625), G (n = 39), and L (n = 3) sequences associated with bats were collected from GenBank. final datasets comprised 30 viral lineages for N (184 unique sequences), 26 lineages for G (68 unique sequences) and 23 lineages for L (48 unique sequences). we compared the fit of the pervasive and episodic selection models at each site using LRTs with 2 df. sites included in later analyses if either method detected significant positive selection. we used Bayesian phylogenetic ancestral host\u2013state reconstruction. a single exception was made for the virus maintained by Desmodus rotundus (DrV), which had a complex demographic history that was poorly captured by the parametric models relative to the BSP."}
