{"summary": "effect of trypsin on the fusogenicity of aMPV F proteins was initially determined. vero cells were transfected with aMPV/A-F, aMPV/B-F, or aMPV/C-F. syncytium formation was extensively observed in cells transfected with each of the three plasmids carrying the F proteins indicated above. obtained from the two quantitative assays were consistent with those obtained from the syncytium formation assay described above. the expression of biotinylated aMPV F protein on the cell surface was determined through western blotting using an anti-Flag antibody. the addition of trypsin did not facilitate the cleavage of aMPV/A and aMPV/B F proteins, whereas trypsin slightly enhanced the cleavage of aMPV the effect of the duration of trypsin treatment on the fusogenic activity of aMPV/C F protein was analyzed using biotinylation and western blot analyses. aMPV/B (VCO3/60616 strain, accession number: AB548428.1) F protein mediates cell-cell fusion in a trypsin-dependent manner. aMPV/C F protein exposed to trypsin for 1 h exhibited significantly increased fusogenic activity compared with that without trypsin. the residues at positions 100 and 101 are determinants for aMPV F protein-mediated membrane fusion in the absence of trypsin. the residue at positions 100 and 101 promotes the cleavage of hMPV F protein and subsequent infection with hMPV19. aMPV F protein is located at positions 99 to 102. the residues at positions 100 or 101 may be determinants for aMPV F protein-mediated cell-cell fusion in the absence of trypsin. single mutations at either position 100 or 101 did not lead to significant differences in the fusogenicity of aMPV F proteins in the presence of trypsin. 101S substitutions can be cleaved only after treatment with trypsin. the residues at positions 100 and 101 in aMPV F proteins were determinants for aMPV F protein-induced membrane fusion in the absence of trypsin. the addition of trypsin boosted the fusogenic activity of aMPV F proteins exposed to trypsin. trypsin promotes the fusogenic activity of aMPV F proteins with 100 K101A mutations. the results showed that trypsin enhanced the fusogenicity of aMPV/C F protein, but not aMPV/A or aMPV/B F. trypsin significantly enhanced the cleavability of all mutant and wild-type aMPV F proteins containing 100 K101A mutations. analysis of the fusogenic activity of mutant and wild-type aMPV F proteins using syncytium formation and reporter gene assays. the data represent the ratio of the expression of F1 vs. the expression of F0 and F1. aMPV/C F protein fusogenicity was increased after low pH treatment. low pH had no influence on the fusogenic activity of aMPV/A and aMPV/B F proteins. aMPV/C F protein was treated with low pH at 0, 12, or 24 h post-transfection. at 48 h post-transfection, we then analyzed the fusogenicity of aMPV/C F protein. no significant difference was observed when the time interval exceeded 24 h. phenotypes did not possess a glycine (G) at position 294. site-directed mutagenesis was performed to change the G residue at 294 in aMPV/C F protein to an E residue. the results showed that the G294E substitution changed aMPV/C F protein into a low pH-independent phenotype. mutant aMPV/A and aMPV/B F proteins containing 294G mediated cell-cell fusion in a low pH-dependent manner for aMPV F proteins. results indicated that residue 294G is a key determinant for mediating cell-cell fusion in a low pH-dependent manner for aMPV F proteins. the 294 site was identified as an important factor that affects the fusogenic activity of aMPV F proteins. we performed biotinylation and western blot analyses to exclude the possibility that substitutions at the 294 site alter the expression of aMPV F proteins. at 48 h post-transfection, the results showed that syncytium formation was extensively observed in cells transfected with each of the three plasmids carrying the F proteins indicated above. no syncytium was formed in cells transfected with empty vector carrying Flag tag, regardless of treatment with trypsin. however, the syncytium induced through aMPV/C F protein after trypsin treatment increased in number (data not shown) and size the F proteins of all three aMPV subtypes were efficiently cleaved in the absence of trypsin. the addition of trypsin did not facilitate the cleavage of aMPV/A and aMPV/B F proteins. unlike the F proteins of aMPV/A and aMPV/B, aMPV/C F protein enhanced cell-cell fusogenic activity. aMPV/C F protein mediates cell-cell fusion in a trypsin-dependent manner. this finding is inconsistent with a previous report showing that aMPV/B mediates cell-cell fusion in a trypsin-dependent manner. aMPV/B propagated in Vero cells, BHK-21 cells, and DF-1 cells in the absence of trypsin. aMPV/C F protein exposed to trypsin for 12 or 24 h exhibited significantly increased fusogenic activity compared with that without trypsin treatment. residues at positions 100 and 101 are determinants for aMPV F protein-mediated membrane fusion in the absence of trypsin. previous studies indicated that hMPV was incapable of initiating growth without exogenous trypsin. aMPV mutant F proteins containing 100Q101S substitutions can be cleaved only after treatment with trypsin. single point mutations at either position 100 or 101 did not alter the trypsin-independent phenotype of aMPV F proteins. aMPV mutant F proteins containing 100Q101S substitutions can be cleaved only after treatment with trypsin. the addition of trypsin boosted the fusogenic activity of the aMPV F protein is proteolytically cleaved into fragments F1 and F2. the fusogenic activity of aMPV F proteins in the presence or absence of trypsin was assessed through syncytium formation and reporter gene assays. V/A, aMPV/B, and aMPV/C F proteins examined the effect of trypsin on fusion promotion. the fusogenicity of all mutant and wild-type aMPV F proteins containing 100 K101A was lower than that of F protein harboring 100R101R or 100 K101 K. low pH-induced cell-cell fusion occurs in a low pH environment. fusion with the plasma membrane is typically induced through neutral pH20,38,43,50. no syncytium was observed in vero cells transfected with empty vector after neutral or low pH treatment. aMPV/C F protein fusogenicity was induced through low pH. the data are presented as the ratio of the aMPV/C F protein at low pH vs. aMPV/C F protein at neutral pH. aMPV/C F protein under low pH treatment was only significantly higher than that at neutral pH treatment at a time interval of less than 12 h. the fusogenic activity of aMPV/C F protein was similar at low and neutral pH. the results showed that the G294E substitution changed aMPV/C F protein into a low pH-independent phenotype. the mutant aMPV/A and aMPV/B F proteins containing 294G mediated cell-cell fusion in a low pH-dependent manner for aMPV F proteins. 294 site regulated the fusogenic activity of aMPV F proteins. the protonation of histidines and electrostatic interactions are important for the activation of certain F proteins38,39,51. previous studies have also demonstrated that residue 294G is responsible for the low pH-stimulated promotion. the model represents the conformation of the aMPV/B F protein. the residue at position 294 affects the fusogenic activity of aMPV F proteins. the cleavage of precursor F protein (F0) is a prerequisite for F protein-mediated membrane fusion. /A, aMPV/B, and aMPV/C F proteins induce cell-cell fusion. residues at positions 100 and 101 in the putative cleavage motif were responsible for aMPV F protein-mediated cell-cell fusion without the exogenous addition of trypsin. previous studies have shown that the trypsin-dependent cleavage motif is only recognized via tissue-specific proteases. paramyxovirus-induced membrane fusion51 demonstrated low pH stimulated the fusogenic activity of aMPV/C F proteins. residue 294G was responsible for the increased the fusogenic activity of aMPV F proteins at low pH. aMPV/A, aMPV/B, and aMPV/C F proteins carrying residue 294H are more fusogenic than those carrying 294G and 294 K. aMPV/C has limited cross-reactivity with aMPV/A and aMPV/B in virus neutralization assays56. aMPV/C has closer antigenic and genetic relatedness to hMPV than to aMPV/A and aMPV/B57,58. aMPV plasmids aMPV/A-F, aMPV/B-F, and aMPV/C-F were transfected with 2 g of each plasmid. the transfected cells were incubated with or without 0.2 g/mL TPCK (L-1-tosylamide-2-phenylethy) the cells were exposed to phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at pH 5.0 (low pH) or 7.4 (neutral pH) for 4 min. this pH pulse was repeated three times at 2-h intervals. at 48 h post-transfection, the cells were observed and photographed. the transfected Vero cells were biotinylated with membrane-impermeable EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin. the cells were centrifuged to collect the supernatants. the expressed proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. plasmids aMPV/A-F, aMPV/B-F, and aMPV/C-F were subcloned into the pCAGGS mammalian expression vector by using the Kpn and Xho restriction sites. all aMPV wild-type and mutant F genes were verified by automated DNA sequencing. mL TPCK (L-1-tosylamide-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone)-trypsin (Sigma) was exposed to phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at pH 5.0 (low pH) or 7.4 (neutral pH) for 4 min. this pH pulse was repeated three times at 2-h intervals. the luciferase activity was measured on an EnVision Multilabel Reader. biotinylation and western blotting Expression of aMPV F proteins on the cell surface was measured. the transfected Vero cells were biotinylated with membrane-impermeable EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin. Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 13.0 software. the data represent the means (standard error) of at least three experiments."}
