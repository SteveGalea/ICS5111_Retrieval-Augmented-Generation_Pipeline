{"summary": "DENV infection causes dengue fever (DF) and the more severe forms of the disease, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) every year, one hundred million new cases of DF and 250,000 DHF/DSS are estimated by the WHO. flaviviruses are positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses. the genome encodes for 3 structural (C, prM, and E) and 7 non-structural proteins. NS5 is a multifunctional protein, consisting of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [10] and methyltransferase (MTase) activities responsible for 5\u2032 RNA cap formation. human IFIT gene family comprises four members: IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3 ( = IFIT4), and IFIT5. mice express IFIT1, 2 and 3 whereas mice express IFIT1 and 2. FITs in HEK-DC-SIGN cells suggested a role for IFIT1 in the attenuation of MTase mutants as a DENV vaccine. results demonstrate the potential of 2\u2032-O-MTase mutants as a deNV vaccine. mutant enzymes retained 95% and 77% of the WT N7-methylation activity. neither mutant exhibited any 2\u2032-O-methylation activity. both mutant and mutant RNAs produced infectious viruses (passage 0) with similar plaque morphologies. image was prepared using DENV-2 MTase (PDB code: IL9K) and PyMOL. effects of E217 and K61+E217A mutations on N7- and 2\u2032-O-MTase activities. reactions were analyzed on thin-layer chromatography. titers were measured at indicated time points using plaque assays. we infected AG129 mice with the WT and 2\u2032-O-MTase mutants. mice lack receptors for type I and type II IFNs. blood was taken at indicated time points and viral titers were measured by real-time PCR. mice were immunized i.p. with 2.75105 PFU of the indicated 2\u2032-O-MTase mutant serotype and challenged 30 days later with 5105 PFU WT DENV-1 strain. mice immunized with 1106 PFU of WT DENV-1 or 5106 WT DENV-2 were protected against homologous challenge. all mice immunized with E216A and/or E217A-infected mice were protected against homologous challenge. we did not observe enhanced infection in vivo (Fig. 2C and see later challenge experiments with a virulent DENV-2 strain) these data suggest that vaccination with the mutants does not cause ADE during heterologous challenge. IFNAR mice were immunized with 2.75105 Pfu DENV-2 E217A or DENV-2 WT. spleens were harvested at day 7 for restimulation in vitro. spleens were harvested at day 7 for detection of IFN- production. NV-2 E217A or DENV-2 WT were harvested at day 7. intracellular IFN- was measured in spleen CD4 and CD8 cells. bars are meansSEM from two independent experiments with 2\u20133 mice per group in each experiment. mice were immunized i.p. with 2.75105 DENV-1 WT, DENV-1 E216A, DENV-2 WT, DENV-2 E217A (strain TSV01) mice were challenged with 107 PFU of D2Y98P. data represent means SEM from 3 experiments with a total of 7\u201310 mice. three groups of Rhesus monkeys (RM) were immunized with different doses of E217A. one group received a low dose (1103 PFU), one group a medium dose (1104 PFU) and one group a high dose (1105 PFU) of E217A virus. viremia was monitored during 10 days after inoculation. no viremia was detected except for one animal (R0105) that had received a high dose (1105 PFU) viremia in RMs immunized with different doses of DENV-2 E217A. live, attenuated deNV MTase mutant virus can induce protective immunity in non-human primates. 1 15 30 15 30 5.0 R0319 M 10 33 106 218 597 5.0 R0212 F 10 122 90 400 378 5.0 R0105 M 10 55 170 339 348 5.0 R0942 F 10 87 122 187 301 GMT 66 119 273 392 4.0 R0055 M 10 46 447 411 386 4.0 R0482 F 10 31 283 400 371 4.0 R0098 F 10 29 80 190 405 GMT 35 HEK-DC-SIGN cells are susceptible to type I IFN but do not produce detectable levels of IFN- after infection with mutant or WT virus. we pretreated HEK-DC-SIGN cells with an increasing dose of IFN- for 24 h. the E217A virus was significantly more sensitive to IFN- pretreatment than the WT virus. the mutation was lost in the presence of IFN, whereas wild-type virus resisted the IFN pressure in both cell lines. the mutation was retained and no compensatory mutations were introduced. human IFIT-1 (ISG56), IFIT-2 (ISG54), IFIT-3 (ISG60), or IFIT-5 (ISG58) on day 2 post-transfection, cells were infected with WT or E217A DENV-2 at an MOI of 5. results represent the mean SEM of six independent experiments. inability of 2\u2032-O-MTase mutant virus to infect the Ae. aegypti vector decreases the risk of mutant virus transmission. the mosquitoes were fed with blood containing WT or E217A. df P-Value WT 5 24/82 (29%) 0.403 2 0.8175 20/82 (24%) 1.472 2 0.479 4 1/72 (1%) 2.305 2 0.3159 1/72 (1%) 2.305 2 0.316 3 3/53 (6%) 3.151 2 0.2069 2/53 (4%) 1.725 2 0.422 E217A 5 0/47 (0%) n/a 2 n/a 4 0/40 (0%) n/ cytoplasm-replicating viruses have evolved N7- and 2\u2032-O-methyltransferases (MTase) to methylate their viral mRNA 5\u2032 cap structures. mutation of the Asp of the tetrad abolished both N7- and 2\u2032-O-MTase activities. mutations of the other three residues of the tetrad abolished 2\u2032-O-methylation. culturing of mutant viruses on vero or HEK-293 cells did not change plaque morphologies. expression of DC-SIGN facilitates DENV infection [24]. similar results were obtained for DENV-1 containing the E216A mutation. pA-RNAm7GpppA-RNA and m7GpppA-RNAm7GpppAm-RNA conversions indicate N7- and 2\u2032-O-methylation activities. reactions were analyzed on thin-layer chromatography (TLC) plates. methylation activities were indicated below the TLC images with WT activity set as 100%. viremia result showed that mutating K61A or E216A in DENV-1 and mutating E217A in DENV-2 attenuated the virus compared to the WT virus. viremia kinetics of WT DENV-1 (strain west Pacific 74), DENV-1 K61A, and DENV-1-E216A in vivo. blood was taken at indicated time points post challenge. IgG antibody titers against DENV-1 (D) and DENV-2 (E) were measured by ELISA. data are representative of two experiments with three to four mice per group. mutants infected with mutant DENV1 or DENV2 were isolated at day 3 after infection and the mutations were found to be stable. mutants cause the same or less antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) than wild-type viruses in the heterologous setting. p DENV-2 p DENV-1 p DENV-2 p DENV-1 E216A 25259 388153 # 0.750.27 0.510.16 # DENV-1 509307 * 556107 0.980.5 * 0.740.2 DENV-2 E217A 197188 1035557 * 0.640.22 1.020.22 * DENV-2 268118 1548566 * 0.620.14 1.270.29 * DENV-1 E216A+DENV-2 E217 splenocytes were re-stimulated with a pool of NS4B and NS5 CD8 peptides. no significant difference in the NS4B and NS5-specific T cell response was seen. Vaccinated mice are protected against challenge with the virulent DENV-2 strain 05K3126 and deNV-2 strain TSV01 do not cause pathology in mice. mice were immunized i.p. with 2.75105 DENV-1 WT, DENV-1 E216A, DENV-2 WT or PBS and challenged them with the virulent strain D2Y98P. 30 days post immunization mice were challenged with 107 PFU of D2Y98P. blood was taken at indicated time points and viral titers were measured by real-time PCR. data represent means SEM from 3 experiments with a total of 7\u201310 mice. full virus genome sequencing of the viral RNA recovered at day 7 showed no compensatory mutations were introduced. ADE was analyzed in a K562 assay and a similar enhancement pattern was observed for both heterologous and homologous infection in vitro. this argues against a physiologically relevant infection enhancement, which would only be expected after heterologous infection. peak titer (SD) Duration days 5.0 R0319 M 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.4 (0.8) 0.8 5.0 R0212 F 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.4 (0.8) 0.8 5.0 R0212 F 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 all animals were challenged with 1105 PFU of WT DENV-2 on day 64 post-immunization. all animals were challenged with 1105 PFU of WT DENV-2 on day 64 post-immunization. animals were challenged with 1105 PFU of WT DENV-2 on day 64 post-immunization. IFN- pre-treatment inhibits 2\u2032-O-MTase mutant infection. HEK-DC-SIGN cells are susceptible to type I IFN. but they do not produce detectable levels of IFN- after infection. E217A was lost in the presence of IFN, whereas wild-type virus resisted the pressure in both cell lines. the mutation was retained and no compensatory mutations were introduced. 2\u2032-O-MTase mutant DENV-2 has altered sensitivity to IFN. we over-expressed human IFIT1, 2, 3, or 5 in HEK-DC-SIGN cells. both mutant and WT virus show similar growth kinetics in untreated cells. we currently don't know why the mutant virus is attenuated in Vero cells but not in HEK-DC-SIGN. the WT virus infected 29% of mosquitoes at the highest titer (1105 PFU/ml), but only 1\u20136% of mosquitoes at lower titers (1103 and 1104 PFU/ml). the mutant virus was unable to infect the Ae. aegypti and, subsequently, no dissemination was observed for all titers. both mutant and WT viruses reached 100% infection rate upon intra-thoracic inoculation. the mean genome copy number reached 4.6109 and 6.2109, respectively. the results demonstrate that the 2\u2032-O-MTase mutant virus is compromised in vector fitness. the fear in a clinical setting is that sub-neutralizing titers of antibodies could enhance infections. a common approach to address ADE in vitro is to infect K562 cells in the presence of antibodies. a previous report found that even strongly neutralizing antibodies are enhancing at concentrations close to the 50% neutralizing titer. a CD8 response to NS4B and NS5 peptides is similar in mice immunized with mutant or WT virus, suggesting that the response is qualitatively equivalent. an attenuated non-chimeric DENV that includes all naturally occurring T and B cell epitopes could be required to confer long-term immunity to re-infection. the 2\u2032-O-MTase mutant virus is attenuated in mice and monkeys. it is likely that pattern recognition receptors and downstream pathways activated by the mutant virus trigger antiviral defense mechanisms in an IFN-dependent and IFN-independent manner. studies in human HEK293 cells show increased susceptibility of DENV2 E217A mutant to IFN- in vitro. the replication level of WNV 2\u2032-O-MTase mutant in mice was largely decreased in the spleen, serum, or brain in comparison with the WT WNV infection. intracranial inoculation of 1105 PFU of 2\u2032-O-MTase mutant WNV did not cause any mortality and morbidity in mice. mutagenesis of MTase was performed using QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit. complete sequence of each mutant MTase was verified by DNA sequencing. standard mutagenesis protocol was used to engineer mutations into MTase region. animals were randomly divided into four groups and inoculated subcutaneously. blood was collected from each RM daily post immunization for 10 days. blood was taken before immunization and on days 15 and 30 post-immunization. serum-virus mixtures were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. the neutralization titer was defined as the lowest serum dilution at which the infectious virus concentration was reduced by 50% from the concentration found when virus was incubated. assay To determine the percentage of infected cells, cells were harvested, washed in PBS and fixed and permeabilized with Cytofix/Cytoperm (BD). intracellular dengue E protein was stained with antibody 4G2 conjugated to Alexa 647 and fluorescent cells were measured by flow cytometry. cells were washed and stained with antibodies CD4-APC, CD8-PercPCy5.5 and IFN--PE-Cy7. cells were acquired on a FACSCantoII (BectonDickinson) and data were analyzed with FlowJo (Treestar ltd.) batches of 50\u201375 female mosquitoes, aged 5\u20137 days, were fed with pig blood containing WT or MTase mutant DENV-2 at titers of 5, 4 and 3 log 10 PFU/ml. mosquitoes were held at 27\u00b0C, 80% relative humidity, and 12 h photoperiod for 15 days, after which the abdomen was separated from the thorax and homogenized. qRT-PCR mix (without ROX) and CFX96 Real-Time PCR Detection System (BioRad) cycling parameters performed were 50\u00b0C for 30 min, 95\u00b0C for 2 min, followed by 45 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 10 sec, 60\u00b0C for 30 sec. a two-tailed unpaired t-test was performed to determine the statistic difference between mean genomic equivalents calculated for WT and mutant viruses. mouse experiments were conducted according to the rules and guidelines of the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA) and the National Advisory Committee for Laboratory animal research (NACLAR) the experiments were reviewed and approved by the Institutional review board of Biological Resource Center, Singapore. all mice were bred and kept under specific pathogen-free conditions. all mice were bred and kept under specific pathogen-free conditions. for challenge experiments DENV produced in C6/36 cells was used. determination of viremia in monkey sera Viremia in serum samples was determined by plaque assay in 12-well plates. undiluted serum or serial 10-fold dilutions of serum were inoculated onto BHK-21 cell monolayers. monolayers were fixed by addition of 1 ml of 4% formalin solution to the overlay medium. IFIT expression plasmids were a kind gift from A. Pichlmair. cells were seeded at 1106 per well in a 6-well plate. 24 hours later cells were transfected using 293fectin according to manufacturer's protocol. antibody-virus mixture was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. then 50 l of the mixture was added to 200,000 cells stably transfected with human DC-SIGN (MOI 0.1\u20131) after 2 h of infection 150 l RPMI medium containing FCS was added. diluted 150 in PBS-M, heat inactivated for 1 hour at 55\u00b0C. threefold serial dilutions were added to the wells. peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG, in PBS-M was added. positive fluorescence determinations were performed manually using an inverted fluorescent microscope (Olympus IX71) chi-square and contingency table statistical tests were performed to detail heterogeneity in vector competence within/between WT and mutant viruses. inoculation of 0.17 l of WT DENV-2 and E217A was performed using 10 female mosquitoes each. wild-type and mutant virus samples were mapped to their respective reference genomes using Bowtie 2 [58]. data analysis was performed in Pipeline Pilot. at least two reads with an alternate base at a given position were defined as a SNP. 7- and 2\u2032-O methylation activities indicated below the TLC images with WT activity set as 100%. BHK-21 cells were transfected with equal amounts of WT and mutant genome-length RNAs of DENV-2.
