{"summary": "myricetin and rutin are two important flavonoids naturally present in plants. myricetin exhibits anti-oxidant, anti-cancer, and cytoprotective properties. it is important to develop a method to determine the contents of myricetin and rutin. multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and reduced graphene oxide (r-GO) are promising conductor materials with high surface area, stable physical and chemical properties. they are easily combined with other nanomaterials due to their constituent hydroxyl (\u2014OH), carboxyl (\u2014COOH), and carbonyl (\u2013C Created by potrace 1.16) functional groups. s Rutin (98%, analytical grade) and chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6) were purchased from beijing, china. the MWCNTs were purchased from aladdin Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. a glassy carbon electrode (GCE, 3 mm in diameter) was polished with 0.3 and 0.05 m alumina powders, then rinsed ultrasonically with absolute alcohol and distilled water. 5 L of a homogeneous suspension of Pt@r-GO@MWCNTs was dropped onto the electrode surface and dried under a nitrogen stream. 3[Fe(CN)6]/K4[Fe(CN)6] solution containing 0.1 M KCl under an open circuit potential at a frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz and 5 mV amplitude. the surface morphology was characterized via field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM; Zeiss Ultra 55, Germany) in 30 mL of double distilled water and mixed for 30 min under ultrasonication. 500 L of a 60 mM H2PtCl6 solution was added and the reaction mixture was stirred vigorously for 30 min. the product was washed three times with a mixed solution of ethanol and water at a ratio of 1:1. DPV scans from 0.1\u20130.8 V with an amplitude of 0.05 V, pulse width of 0.05 s, pulse period of 0.5 s, and increment of 0.004 V were performed. for CV, scan rate was 50 mV/s and sample interval was 0.001 V. surface morphology was characterized via field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM; Zeiss Ultra 55, Germany) Fig. 3A shows the CVs of different electrodes in a 5.0 mmol/dm3 K3[Fe(CN)6]/K4[Fe(CN)6] solution containing 0.1 M KCl at 50 mV/s. a pair of reversible redox peaks were observed at +0.26 and + 0.17 V for the bare GCE (curve a) WCNTs/GCE (b) in 5.0 mmol/dm3 K3[Fe(CN)6]/K4[Fe(CN)6] containing 0.1 M KCl. bare GCE and Pt@r-GO@MWCNTs/GCE in 50 M myricetin and 50 M rutin solutions are shown in Fig. 4A. CVs of the Pt@r-GO@MWCNTs/GCE in pH 3.0 BR buffer solution containing 50 M myricetin and 50 M rutin at different scan rates (20\u2013300 mV/s) the effects of scan rate were investigated by CVs in a pH 3.0 BR buffer solution containing 50 M myricetin and 50 M rutin. the effect of pH was investigated by DPVs in BR buffer solution containing 50 M myricetin and rutin at different pH values. as the pH increased, oxidation peak currents of both myricetin and rutin increased until pH 3 and then decreased at higher pH values. the effects of pre-concentration time and potential were studied in the pH 3 BR buffer solution containing 50 M myricetin and rutin. in Fig. 7A, the oxidation peak current increased progressively with an increase in pre-concentration time and achieved a maximum value when the pre-concentration time was 550 s, and decreased afterwards. DPVs of the individual quantitative determination of different rutin concentrations in the presence of 2 M myricetin in the pH 3 BR buffer solution are shown in Fig. 8C. the oxidation peak current and concentration showed two linear detection ranges of 0.05\u201310 and 10\u201350 M. the concentration of myricetin and oxidation peak current exhibited two linear detection ranges of 0.05\u201310 and 10\u201350 M with equations of Ip (A) = 2.0561C (M) + 1.6368 (R2 = 0.9958) and Ip (A) = 0.5643C (M) + 17.2910 (R2 = 0.9731), respectively. electrochemical devices reported for detection of myricetin or rutin. no significant signal changes were observed for the sensor. oxidation peak currents of myricetin and rutin indicate good selectivity. three modified electrodes were stored under refrigerated conditions. they were used for myricetin and rutin analysis at 10-day intervals. the real orange juice sample recovery rate ranged between 100.57% and 108.46%, and the RSD value was 6%. the prepared sensor can be successfully applied for the simultaneous determination of myricetin and rutin in real orange juice samples. Fig. 1 shows the SEM images at low and high magnification of the ternary Pt@r-GO@MWCNTs nanocomposites. the Pt NPs were uniformly and densely distributed in the MWCNTs and r-GO. the main components were C, O and Pt at approximately 85.27, 12.5, and 2.23 wt%. bare GCE and Pt@r-GO@MWCNTs/GCE exhibited a small resistance. but when the Pt@r-GO@MWCNTs nanocomposite GCE was used, it displayed a significantly smaller resistance. the CV and EIS diagrams further demonstrate the successful preparation of the Pt@r-GO@MWCNTs/GCE sensor. oxidation peak current signals increased by a factors of 11 and 50 for myricetin and rutin, respectively, over that of the bare GCE. the potential differences were large enough to realize the simultaneous determination of myricetin and rutin. the electrocatalytic reactions of both myricetin and rutin on the Pt@r-GO@MWCNTs/GCE are typical adsorption-controlled processes. the effect of pH was investigated by DPVs in BR buffer solution containing (A) 50 M myricetin and (B) 50 M rutin at different scan rates (20\u2013300 mV/s) the slopes of the respective equations were 70.2 and 63.2 mV/pH. both myricetin and rutin oxidation followed the Nernst equation requiring identical number of protons and electrons.
