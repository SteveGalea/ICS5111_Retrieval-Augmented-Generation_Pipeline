{"summary": "diagnostic molecular strip combined a generic nested touchdown protocol with in-house primer master-mixes that could recognise 12 common respiratory viruses. results Over an 18 month period a total of 222 specimens were tested by both immunofluorescence and the molecular strip. influenza A virus (FLA); influenza B virus (FLB); respiratory syncytial virus (RSV); parainfluenza virus type 1 (PF1); parainfluenza virus type 2 (PF2); parainfluenza virus type 3 (PF3) and adenovirus (ADV) human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is not yet part of most United Kingdom virus laboratory test repertoires. the aBI PRISM 7000 real-time facility from Applied Biosystems addresses this by using bundled software to design primer/probe combinations. however this approach is compromised by the inability of software to allow for target heterogeneity. to address these problems we adopted an alternative approach through the development of a generic touchdown amplification protocol. cloned targets ranged from 6 103 copies per ml for human rhinovirus type 1b to 4.2 103 copies/ml for RSV-A. specificity was ascribed through reproducibility, i.e. specimens which were repeatedly positive, following our standard clinical reporting algorithm. immunofluorescence detected virus in 6/36 (16.6%) broncho-alveolar lavages, 23/120 (19.1%) nasopharyngeal secretions, 1/35 (2.8%) sputa and 1/31 (3.2%) combined throat and nasal swabs. median age of male and female patients where virus was detected was 3 y (range 2 weeks \u2013 79 years) adenovirus 22 3 Parainfluenza Virus Type 2 1 0 Parainfluenza Virus Type 3 10 8 Respiratory Syncytial Virus 4 4 Total Positive 99 31 Total Tested 222 222 * Included 17 influenza A H3 and 4 influenza A H1. dual infections were detected in 11/79 (13.9%) patients. no parainfluenza virus types 1 or 2 were detected including influenza B virus (1); parainfluenza virus type 3 (8); respiratory syncytial virus (4); adenovirus (3). one patient had 2 specimens taken on the same day in which the same virus, parainfluenza type 3, was detected. PCR PCR identified one or more viruses in specimens from 84 of the 183 patients and the 4 NEQAS positive specimens. a total of 99 viruses were detected by immunofluorescence. no parainfluenza virus type 1, coronavirus 229E or human metapneumovirus were detected. the virus identified were rhinovirus (3), adenovirus (1) and parainfluenza type 3 (1); the latter was immunofluorescence positive. in 2 cases a rhinovirus was detected in only one specimen. a series of amplification steps linked to a stepped reduction in annealing temperature was constructed. this included the apparent anomaly of putting adenovirus through an initial reverse transcription step to stream line all of the targets on to a single strip. the touchdown surprisingly out-performed individual amplification protocols optimised for annealing temperature and thus proved suitable for use on the diverse range of respiratory viruses. we have recently replaced the primer sets for influenza A H1 and H3 with a generic matrix set (copy number sensitivities of 8 103 and 2 103 copies per ml) the use of strips containing pre-dispensed mastermixes facilitates their use in a routine setting. the strip is designed for a single use only and thus only goes through a single freeze-thaw cycle. the strip was constructed to detect a wider range of viruses than immunofluorescence. over the period of validation it almost doubled the number of viruses that could have been detected by immunofluorescence. the detection of adenovirus showed the most dramatic increase. these infections are underdiagnosed by the standard techniques of immunofluorescence and culture. they are the second commonest virus, after HRV, that we observe in mixed infections. a factor which often impacts negatively on a laboratory's decision to use molecular diagnostics is one of cost. the molecular strip was better at detecting multiple infections. the molecular strip was complemented by the touchdown protocol. the protocol can report definitive results within 24 hours, considerably faster than culture. the molecular strip is capable of diagnosing dual infections. the combined strip and touchdown protocol is a convenient and reliable method of testing for multiple viruses in a routine setting. 222 specimens were included in the validation between January 2002 and June 2003, including 14 from an influenza surveillance scheme. an aliquot of 410 l was taken off for extraction after which the specimens were centrifuged at 2600 g for 5 min. the resulting cell deposits were air-dried on glass multi-well slides and fixed in acetone prior to testing. the respiratory strip targeted the following 12 common respiratory viruses. primer sets used were taken from published studies. included primer sets validated in-house after modification or de-novo design. primer sequences, gene targets and expected product sizes for viruses on molecular strip.
