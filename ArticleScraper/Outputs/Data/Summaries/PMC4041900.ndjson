{"summary": "from 1960, six strains of human coronaviruses have emerged that includes SARS-CoV and the recent infection by deadly MERS-CoV. a universal vaccine for all strain of human coronavirus could be a promising solution in this circumstance. the first coronavirus 229E was identified in 1960. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1 and MERS-CoV are the coronaviruses which infect human. most infections caused by human coronaviruses were relatively mild. ERS-CoV infection relies on exclusively supportive care, which gives the high case-fatality rate, is not highly effective. a definitive treatment was not clearly established and the therapeutic interventions have not been evaluated in vivo. there is currently no specific therapy or vaccine for human coronaviruses, but this disease has been severe with a high case-fatality rate. bioinformatics analyses of viral proteins were done for finding the conserved peptide region and for mapping the evolutionary conserved epitope. RNA directed RNA polymerase is highly conserved in all human coronavirus strains. no conserved region was found in case of S, E, M and N proteins. conservation summery using 11-base scale for conservancy and BLOSUM 62 for quality. yellow color bar and star sign indicates good quality. all the colors changes according to conservation and alignment quality. YPKCDRA 7 YYVKPG 6 Nine surface accessible epitopes were predicted from the conserved peptide. if the antibody can bind to the epitope, an epitope should be accessible. accessibility of the conserved peptide was determined using 1.000 threshold level. nine accessible epitopes were found to be above the threshold level. the surface accessible residues of the conserved peptide are located in the yellow region. YPKCDRA and WDYPKC epitopes are in the same region and 100% conserved in all human coronaviruses. the whole epitope was then selected as the desired universal vaccine candidate. three of the four epitopes were found to be 100% conserved. Y axis indicates the epitopes and X axis indicates the conservancy percentage. a threshold of 3.448 was used which is indicated by the red line. RNA directed RNA polymerase is highly conserved in all human coronavirus strains. no conserved region was found in case of S, E, M and N proteins. RNA directed RNA polymerase is highly conserved in all human coronavirus strains. conservation summery using 11-base scale for conservancy and BLOSUM 62 for quality. black bars showed consensus sequence and yellow color indicates good quality. all colors changes according to conservation and alignment quality. idues in the yellow region are antigenic and in the green region are below the threshold (red line) idues in the yellow region are antigenic and in the green region are below the threshold (red line) the surface accessibility of the conserved peptide was determined using 1.000 threshold level. nine accessible epitopes were found to be above the threshold level. the surface accessible residues of the conserved peptide are located in the yellow region. YPKCDRA and WDYPKC epitopes are in the same region and 100% conserved in all human coronaviruses. therefore, the whole epitope WDYPKCDRA which is 100% conserved was then selected as the desired universal vaccine candidate. three of the four epitopes were found to be 100% conserved. here Y axis indicates the epitopes and X axis indicates the conservancy percentage. the WDYPKCDRA epitope was found to be hydrophilic in nature. the targeted WDYPKCDRA epitope was found to be in the surface and accessible in the RNA directed RNA polymerase 3D structure. a new coronavirus strain called MERS-CoV is now going to cause another outbreak. researchers also reported to design vaccine against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV spike protein. the concept of prevention of viruses by designing a universal vaccine has also been reported previously, for example against influenza virus. replicase polyprotein 1ab was taken to check whether there is any conservancy among the non structural protein. in case of S, E, M and N protein, no putative conserved region was found. this protein is less mutating than the S, E, M and N protein. human coronaviruses are not structurally related but it is possible to design an epitope-based universal vaccine for all human coronavirus strains. results are based on sequence analysis and computational predictions show predicted epitope would be a candidate target for the universal vaccine. bepipred predicts linear B-cell epitopes using hidden Markov model [29]. Default threshold 0.35 was used for Bepipred analysis. I-TASSER server gives protein 3D structure by multiple threading alignments. the model for which G factor was highest, and amino acid residues in favorable region was higher in PROCHECK analysis was selected as the best model. retrieved sequences were aligned using UCSF Chimera [35] visualization tool. prediction tools of the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) linear epitope prediction tools [28] made the option of using different prediction methods. Kolaskar and Tongaonkar Antigenicity method [27] was applied in this study using a threshold of 1.000 because it predicts the antigenicity of the provided protein sequence. the model for which G factor was highest, and amino acid residues in favorable region was higher in PROCHECK analysis was selected as the best model. the model was then used to locate the epitope by using UCSF Chimera [35] visualization tool. all human coronaviruses are found to be conserved in their replicase polyprotein 1ab. red colored region is the most favored region, brown and yellow colored regions are additionally allowed region and generously allowed regions respectively."}
