{"summary": "a number of factors, including multiple microorganisms, often act synergistically to create a certain clinical picture. a viral infection that under certain circumstances does not cause apparent problems for the infected host can, under other circumstances, have severe economic consequences. a viral infection that under certain circumstances does not cause apparent problems for the infected host can, under other circumstances, have severe consequences. viral metagenomics was used to characterise the viral community of individual pigs coming from a conventional herd with respiratory lesions at slaughter. to understand complex diseases, we need to identify viruses that make up a basal virome at different ages, in different herds, in connection to different health statuses. reared pigs from farrow-to-finish herd with high prevalence of respiratory lesions (pneumonia and pleuritic) registered in both herds. no clinical signs of PCV2-associated diseases. the concentrations of the purified random PCR products ranged from 18 to 25 ng/L. those of the purified SPIA products ranged from 36 to 66 ng/L. the main type of sequencing errors associated with this platform are insertions and deletions. the complete PPV7 viral genome was amplified using the KAPA LongRange HotStart PCR Kit. the reaction was initiated with a 3 min heating step at 95 \u00b0C. the sequences were aligned using the maximum Likelihood method. the experiment was approved by the uppsala Ethical Committee on Animal Experiments. eight tonsils were collected from conventionally reared pigs from a farrow-to-finish herd with a high prevalence of respiratory lesions. none of the pigs included in the study were vaccinated against influenza, nor any other respiratory pathogen. the PCR tag-sequence was cleaved away using EcoRV. the RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA and amplified by single-primer isothermal amplification (SPIA) using the Ovation RNA-Seq V2 kit. the concentrations of the purified random PCR products ranged from 18 to 25 ng/L. the diamond results were visualised using MEGAN (ver. 6.8.20) the datasets containing the raw data have been deposited in GenBank under the bioSample accession numbers (SAMN08969257-SAMN08969272) the selection was mainly based on the number of reads and their distribution across the viral genome. the sequences were assembled using seqMan (Lasergene 9, DNASTAR, Madison, WI, USA) the phylogenetic analyses were performed using MEGA7 [15]. the evolutionary history was inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method based on the Tamura Nei model. more than 10 reads per sample are marked with a lighter green. Posavirus 1 has not been assigned to a viral family. both porcine mastadenovirus A and B were present in the population. the porcine mastadenovirus reads/contigs matched to porcine adenovirus 3. the porcine mastadenovirus B reads/contigs matched to adenovirus 4. porcine bocavirus 4 was identified in 12 out of 16 pigs. we prioritised to further characterise the PPV7 identified in four pigs. a nucleotide sequence of 4062 bp was obtained. phylogenetic analysis of porcine parvovirus 7 showed that PPV7 from this study grouped with PPV7 from us and china. the evolutionary history was inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method based on the Tamura Nei model with a bootstrap value of 1000. the highest similarity was seen between two teschoviruses belonging to serotype 10. in the phylogenetic analysis, the two Swedish teschoviruses grouped together in the same clade as these teschoviruses. teschoviruses obtained from this study are marked with black circles. the longest posavirus contig (1375 nt) found in sample R1 showed the closest similarity (82% nucleotide identity and 89% protein identity) to a german isolate from 2014. a few sapovirus and astrovirus reads were identified in the samples. the viruses identified in the viral metagenomic analysis will be described more in detail. the table displays the viruses identified in each of the 16 pigs. eight conventionally reared pigs from a herd with respiratory problems are marked with a lighter green. both porcine mastadenovirus A and B were present in the population. the porcine mastadenovirus reads/contigs matched to porcine adenovirus 3. the porcine mastadenovirus B reads/contigs matched to porcine adenovirus 4. porcine mastadenovirus B was also identified in 10 animals. no complete genome sequence was available from GenBank. only sequences from the fibre and the E1B 55K genes were available. PPV7 NS1 sequences were available from the us and china. the ORF coding for Cap was 1401 nucleotides long, yielding a 467 amino acid long protein. in the 421\u2013552 nucleotide region of the Swedish PPV7 Cap protein, there was high variation compared to the previously characterised PPV7. the coverage/sequence depth for R6 was 6\u2013535 and 2\u2013296 for R7. for both the teschoviral genomes, one open reading frame (6615 nt) coding for the large polyprotein (2205 amino acids) was identified. the highest similarity was seen between two teschoviruses belonging to serotype 10. porcine sapeloviruses reads showed the closest similarity to porcine sapelovirus A strains from Asia. the longest contig (1375 nt) found in sample R1 showed the closest similarity (82% nucleotide identity and 89% protein identity) to a german isolate from 2014. porcine cytomegalovirus (PCMV), PCV2, PRCV, and TTSuV are considered minor pathogens that could play a role through co-infection or in combination with other outer factors. in this study, none of the viruses considered major pathogens were detected, which was partly expected. adenoviruses were present in all pigs, and 16 out of 18 pigs were positive for picornaviruses. porcine adenovirus 3 and 4 were identified in different samples from this study. there is a lack of complete genomes of adenoviruses available. pVIII, pVIII, E1B 55K, and DNA repeat region have been previously sequenced. different parvoviruses are also known to be present in pigs worldwide. pathogenicity of these viruses is not well known. teschovirus is endemic in pigs worldwide, and there are 13 known serotypes. a high number of reads were identified, enabling the assembly of two complete genomes. the viruses identified in these two pigs showed were most similar to PTV-10."}
