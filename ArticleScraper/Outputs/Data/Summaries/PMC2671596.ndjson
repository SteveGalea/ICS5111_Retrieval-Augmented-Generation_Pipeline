{"summary": "recombination is an important evolutionary mechanism that contributes to this genetic diversification. by creating novel combinations of pre-existing genetic polymorphisms in a single replication cycle, recombination enables greater movements through sequence space than can be achieved by individual point mutations. recombination provides access to evolutionary \u201cshortcuts\u201d. recombination events found in natural viral populations are significantly less disruptive of protein folding than randomly generated recombinants. recombination events found in natural viral populations are significantly less disruptive of protein folding than randomly generated recombinants. recombination events found in natural viral populations are significantly less disruptive of protein folding than randomly generated recombinants. subtype recombinant is transmitted between multiple individuals. the env gene encodes two polypeptides that form a heterodimer at the surface of the viral particle. this gene encodes two polypeptides (gp120 and gp41) that form a heterodimer. recombinants that were produced during reverse transcription were not subjected to any selection. the system mimics a single cycle of viral infection in which reverse transcription products neither influence cellular survival, nor confer a specific phenotype to the transduced cells. the regions of the envelope gene that were studied were chosen so as to obtain 700 to 1,500 nucleotides overlapping windows, spanning the whole of env. a recombination rate per nucleotide and per reverse transcription run was calculated within a 50 nucleotides sliding window. peaks and troughs were apparent all along the gene, with regions refractory to recombination more common in the gp120 coding portion than in the 81.6% of all the breakpoints (337/413) were mapped. these six hot regions are areas where recombination occurs preferentially during HIV replication, irrespective of the parental strains involved. possible recombination hot-spots, troughs dipping below the grey regions represent possible recombination cold-spots. the pale-blue shaded areas numbered from 1 to 6 correspond to breakpoint clusters, or hot regions, as defined in the text. selection for functional recombinants is dependent on the interplay of multiple factors. a variant of NL4.3 does not express Env (NL4.3-Env) [31] was co-transfected to complement the production of gp120 and gp41 proteins. a plasmid encoding the wild-type Env was co-transfected to complement the production of gp120 and gp41 proteins. the viral titres obtained with every chimaeric RRE sequence we tested were both similar to those obtained with non-recombinant pcDNA3.1 expression vector was used to transfect HEK 293T-CD4+-CCR5+ cells at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1. the functionality of the recombinant envelopes was then tested after transduction of HEK 293T-CD4+-CCR5+ cells at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1. infection was limited to reverse transcription and, potentially, integration. luciferase values determined for each recombinant were plotted as a function of the corresponding breakpoint position. most of the severely defective recombinants contained breakpoints in hot regions 2 and 3 of the recombination rate distribution. each individual recombinant tested is indicated by a circle. Error bars indicate standard deviations observed in four independent experiments. the six recombination-prone regions defined in Figure 2B are shaded in pale blue. the same approach used in Figure 2B to define the probability that at any region of the genome the breakpoints were more clustered than would be expected by chance was used, with a 200 nucleotides window. previous analysis of HIV recombinants modelled the distribution of breakpoints and indicated a significant clustering of breakpoints in the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the envelope gene. remarkably well to recombination hot regions 1, 5 and 6 seen in cell culture (light-blue boxes) there was close correspondence between the cold-spots detected in both distributions. the recombination breakpoint distribution detectable using HIV 1 group M env genes sampled from nature and in cell culture after correction for the functionality of the recombinants. env predicted to have a significantly lower impact on protein folding than randomly placed breakpoints. selection for fully functional recombinants was then used to determine the distribution of 133 expected breakpoints. only regions 1, 4, 5 and 6 remained areas of significant clustering (light-green boxes at the bottom of Figure 5A) in order to quantify variations in recombination rates across env we used a previously described experimental system where human T cells are transduced with HIV-1 replication-defective vectors pseudotyped with the Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) envelope. the system mimics a single cycle of viral infection in which reverse transcription products neither influence cellular survival, nor confer a specific phenotype to the transduced cells. the regions of the envelope gene that were studied were chosen so as to obtain 700 to 1,500 nucleotides overlapping windows, spanning the whole of env. a recombination rate per nucleotide and per reverse transcription run was calculated within a 50 nucleotides sliding window. peaks and troughs were apparent all along the gene, with regions refractory to recombination more common in the gp120 coding portion than in the these six hot regions are areas where recombination occurs preferentially during HIV replication. recombination rates per nucleotide observed after a single infection cycle are plotted as a function of the position along the env gene. a subset of recombinants containing breakpoints in the RRE region was also tested. the functionality of chimaeric RREs was tested by measuring viral titres obtained upon transfection of cells with a plasmid containing the proviral sequence of the molecular clone NL4.3 of HIV-1. a plasmid encoding the wild-type Env was co-transfected to complement the production of gp120 and gp41 proteins. the viral titres obtained with every chimaeric RRE sequence we tested were both similar to those obtained with non-recombinant parental RRE sequences. this result clearly indicated that recombinants generated by breakpoints within the RRE generally retain the functionality of this element. recombinant envelopes were used to generate viral particles pseudotyped with the recombinant envelope of interest. the functionality of the recombinant envelopes was then tested after transduction of HEK 293T-CD4+-CCR5+ cells at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1. infection was limited to reverse transcription and potentially, integration. luciferase values determined for each recombinant were plotted as a function of the corresponding breakpoint position. most of the severely defective recombinants contained breakpoints in hot regions 2 and 3 of the recombination rate distribution. each individual recombinant tested is indicated by a circle. Error bars indicate standard deviations observed in four independent experiments. the six recombination-prone regions defined in Figure 2B are shaded in pale blue and annotated accordingly above the graph. the same approach used in Figure 2B to define the probability that at any region of the genome the breakpoints were more clustered than would be expected by chance was used, with a 200 nucleotides window. previous analysis of HIV recombinants modelled the distribution of breakpoints and indicated a significant clustering of breakpoints in the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the envelope gene. hot regions 1, 5 and 6 were seen in cell culture (light-blue boxes) there was close correspondence between the cold-spots detected in both distributions. the recombination breakpoint distribution detectable using HIV 1 group M env genes sampled from nature (purple) and in cell culture after correction for the functionality of the recombinants. mechanistic recombination rate variation (Figure 2B) and selection for fully functional recombinants (Figure 3) were then used to determine the distribution of 133 expected breakpoints. only regions 1, 4, 5 and 6 remained areas of significant clustering (light-green boxes at the bottom of Figure 5A) the highest recombination peak within the second region in Figure 2B coincides with a recombination hot-spot that is determined by the presence of a stable RNA hairpin structure. the fourth hot region corresponds to the RRE RNA structure that is highly conserved amongst all HIV isolates. the low recombination tolerance of the gp120-encoding region could only be imprecisely predicted based on computational estimates of recombination induced protein fold disruption using the SCHEMA algorithm. despite these issues, selection has been acting against recombinants with disrupted protein folding. the only major deviation from this was constituted by the fourth recombination hot region observed in cell culture. similarities between the natural and experimental breakpoint distributions suggest that the forces responsible for the selection of recombinants in vivo only have limited impact on inter-subtype breakpoint patterns in env. experimentally reproducing the generation of HIV-1 recombinants. we demonstrate that the distinctive distribution of breakpoints found in natural viruses is strongly shaped by both the mechanism of recombination, and the relative functionality of the resulting products. this may ultimately be an efficient means by which we can devise effective vaccines and improve drugs against the virus. single cycle tissue culture recombination assays performed using a system previously developed by our laboratory. HIV-1 env fragments from group M subtypes A, C, D and G, and from group O viral DNA were amplified by PCR from infected PBMCs obtained from patients. the trans-complementation plasmids, pCMV R8.2 [40] encoding HIV-1 Gag, Pol, and accessory proteins, and pHCMV the frequency of recombination was determined by computing the number of blue colonies over the total number of colonies. the recombinant and parental sequences of each pair of isolates tested were aligned using CLUSTAL X [43] the breakpoint location of each recombinant was determined as being the central position of the interval bounded by the closest nucleotide sites. the various R values were reported in the graph as a function of the position of the midpoint of the window along the gene (i.e. the position of the 25th nucleotide of each sliding window) the analysis based on the sliding window was repeated for the pooled dataset reported in Figure 2B. local recombination rate data used to generate the graph in Figure 2B were first multiplied by the respective functionality scores given in Figure 3 for each corresponding region. the number of breakpoints present in a 50 nucleotides rolling window, sliding with a 10 nucleotides increment was calculated and plotted as function of the position along the gene. a portion of the envelope gene containing the RRE of pNL4.3-Env-Luc was replaced with the corresponding sequence of parental or recombinant envelope genes or, as a negative control, a 400 nt sequence from the Drosophila melanogaster desoxynucleoside kinase gene. all constructs were verified by sequencing. production of viral particles was tested using an enzyme linked immunoassay for HIV-p24 antigen detection. cells were washed twice in PBS and lysed in 25 mM Tris phosphate, pH 7.8, 8 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1% triton X-100, and 7% glycerol for 10 min in a shaker. a window size of 30 nucleotide positions was used for the rdp3 method. the approximate breakpoint positions and recombinant sequence(s) inferred for every potential recombination event were manually checked and adjusted. all remaining breakpoint positions were manually checked and adjusted. gp120 (PDB ID: 2B4C, determined by X-ray diffraction, resolution of 3.3, 338 amino acids, [55]) and gp41 (PDB ID 1AIK, determined by X-ray diffraction, resolution of 2, 70 amino acids, [56]) were plotted instead of absolute breakpoint numbers. we performed SCHEMA predictions of recombination induced fold disruptions. cell culture HEK 293T, and CD4+CCR5+ 293T cells were grown in modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. MT4 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum and antibiotics at 37\u00b0C with 10% CO2. trans-complementation plasmids, pCMV R8.2 [40] encoding HIV-1 Gag, Pol, and accessory proteins, and pHCMV-G [41] encoding the Vesicular Stomatitis Virus envelope protein were co-transfected into 293T cells. the reverse transcription products were purified from the cytoplasmic fraction of transduced cells using the method described by Hirt [42] we define each recombination window studied with each pair of parental sequences as RwXYa\u2013b, for a recombination window involving isolates X and Y. a 50 nucleotides window was then considered (XYa\u2013bSwi, for a sliding window starting at position i of env) the number of breakpoints (indicated as XYa\u2013bni) falling within the window was counted. based on the sliding window was repeated. we used a modification of a permutation test described previously. the test essentially involved the completely randomised placement of recombination breakpoints. a 50 nucleotides rolling window, sliding with a 10 nucleotides increment, was calculated and plotted as function of the position along the gene. a portion of the envelope gene containing the RRE of pNL4.3-Env-Luc (nucleotides 7646 to 8046) was replaced with the corresponding sequence of parental or recombinant envelope genes. supernatants were harvested 48 h post transfection. supernatants were filtered trough a 0.45 M filter. p24 levels were determined using the HIV-1 p24 enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay kit. luciferase assay kit was used to measure luciferase activity. plasmids from at least three independent bacterial clones were tested. alignment was reduced to subtype reference sequences, 53 CRF strains and finally 197 apparently unique recombinants. phylogenetic and recombination signal analysis features available in rdp3. breakpoint positions were classified as unknown if they were detected at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the alignment but could have actually fallen outside the analysed region. all remaining breakpoint positions were manually checked and adjusted. SCHEMA predictions of recombination induced fold disruptions were performed using the set of natural HIV env recombinants. this involved computing protein fold disruption, or E, scores for each natural recombinant with identifiable parents. based on every pair of parental sequences identified for the observed set of recombinants, simulating every possible recombinant. simulated recombination events (0.04 MB DOC) click here for additional data file."}
