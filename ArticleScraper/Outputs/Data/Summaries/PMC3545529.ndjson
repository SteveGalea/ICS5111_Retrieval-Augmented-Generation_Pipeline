{"summary": "recombinant murine FAP extracellular domain (ECD) was cloned into the pSEC/Tag2 expression vector with a (His)6 tag at the 5\u2032 end and a FLAG tag at the 3\u2032 end. the dipeptidyl peptidase activity of FAP-ECD was assayed using alanine-proline-7-amido-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (Ala-Pro-AFC) naive human scFv phage display library containing 1010 unique phages was constructed by Dr. Wayne A. Marasco's group. the 27-billion-member mehta I/II human scFv phage display library was assembled from rearranged VH and VL genes from 57 healthy donors. the culture was incubated at 37\u00b0C in 2XYT medium with ampicillin (100 g/ml) and kanamycin (25 g/ml) but without glucose. the bacteria were centrifuged at 10,800 g, and the phage supernatant was treated with 20% polyethylene glycol 6000/2.5 M NaCl. the second round of panning used an initial depletion step employing gelatin/FAP complexes. scFvs were isolated from colonies streaked on an ampicillin 2XYT agar plate. a 750-bp band was gel extracted and ligated into the pCYN expression vector. the amino acid sequences were deduced from assembled sequence contigs and subjected to cluster analysis. embryonic kidney 293 cells were transfected with either empty vector (HEK293-Mock) or FAP (HEK293-FAP) vector (13) cells were incubated with scFv for 30 min on ice, followed by another 30-min incubation with FITC-labeled mouse anti-His antibody. the data were processed using a BD FACScan (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) serial concentrations of 40 anti-FAP scFv antibodies were incubated with 60 ng FAP-ECD for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. the endopeptidase activity of FAP was assayed using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) peptide substrate that contained the FAP-sensitive Pro12-Asn13 bond. Mut E3 yeast display library was generated by random mutagenesis of WT-E3 scFv followed by gap repair homologous recombination after electroporation of Mut PCR product. clones with higher binding to FAP were sequenced and cloned into pCYN vector for further analysis. mutation-containing pCYN plasmids were checked by sequencing before transformation into TG1 cells for scFv expression. production of in vivo-like fibroblast 3D matrix and indirect immunofluorescent staining of fibronectin were done as described previously (17, 23) five images/experiment (z stack of 0.5-m-thick z slices) were captured using a perkin-Elmer spinning-disc microscope (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Waltham, MA, USA) the z slices were reconstituted as 3D-overlay maximum-projection images using MetaMorph offline imaging analysis software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) murine FAP ECD (1\u2013761 aa) was cloned into the pSEC/Tag2 expression vector with a (His)6 tag at the 5\u2032 end and a FLAG tag at the 3\u2032 end. the dipeptidyl peptidase activity of FAP-ECD was assayed using alanine-proline-7-amido-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin as a substrate. the 27-billion-member mehta I/II human scFv phage display library was assembled from 57 healthy donors that were cloned into the pFARBER phagemid vector. the naive human phage display library was incubated in the immunotubes in 2% milk/PBS for 60 min prior to washing with PBS/0.1% Tween-20 15. eluted phages from round 2B targeted epitopes previously occupied by gelatin were amplified in the third round. 192 colonies from each round were amplified by rescuing with 5 108 M13K07 helper phage in 2XYT/ampicillin/kanamycin, followed by purification using PEG solution. anti-M13 antibody conjugated to HRP in a 1:5000 dilution was added as the secondary antibody. PCR fingerprinting analysis was performed on 115 positive clones. DNAs of 53 scFvs were isolated from colonies streaked on an ampicillin 2XYT agar plate. cells were incubated with scFv for 30 min on ice, followed by another 30-min incubation with FITC-labeled mouse anti-His antibody. the samples were analyzed on a BD FACScan (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) serial concentrations of 40 distinct anti-FAP scFv antibodies were incubated with 60 ng FAP-ECD for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. the endopeptidase activity of FAP was assayed using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) peptide substrate that contained the FAP-sensitive Pro12-Asn13 bond. Mut E3 yeast display library was generated by random mutagenesis of WT-E3 scFv, followed by gap repair homologous recombination. primers used for error-prone PCR were forwand, 5\u2032-AGTAACGTTTGTCAGTAATTGC-3\u2032, and reverse, 5\u2032-GTCGATTCTCTACAC-3\u2032. single clones were picked randomly after the third and fourth round of sorting. mutation-containing pCYN plasmids were checked by sequencing before transformation into TG1 cells for scFv expression. production of in vivo-like fibroblast 3D matrix, fibronectin staining, and analysis of fiber orientation were done as described previously (17, 23) five images/experiment (z stack of 0.5-m-thick z slices) were captured using a perkin-Elmer spinning-disc microscope (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Waltham, MA, USA) the z slices were reconstituted as 3D-overlay maximum-projection images using MetaMorph offline imaging analysis software. 2% gelatin was incubated with FAP and Ala-Pro-AFC. nearly 75% inhibition of the fluorescent substrate cleavage by FAP was seen. this is consistent with gelatin functioning as a competitive inhibitor of FAP activity. scFv phage display library was incubated with FAP-coated immunotubes. the first round of panning selected for all scFvs that bind to FAP. this includes scFvs that bind to the catalytic site of FAP. the desired catalytic site binders (bright green) remained in the supernatant. titer of eluted phage bound to FAP increased by 105-fold following 3 rounds of selection. antibodies binding to FAP were identified by ELISA from randomly selected single colonies from the second and third rounds of panning. scFvs selected in round 2 tended to have greater diversity as determined by deduced amino acid sequences subject to cluster analysis. enzymatic activity by moderate-affinity scFv FAP enzymatic activity was performed with all 40 scFvs identified from phage display. only one scFv, named E3, was found to inhibit the FAP cleavage of the fluorescent substrate. scFvs failed to bind HEK-FAP cells when measured by flow cytometry. however, its ability to inhibit FAP enzymatic activity suggests that E3 can bind the native conformation of FAP. unique clones found that the difficulty of expression and purification might be due to frequent framework mutations that could cause failure of correct protein folding and secretion. only 3 Mut E3 4-12-derived variants, named E3 Mut1, Mut2, and Mut3, could be expressed in sufficient quantities by TG1 cells (cloned in pCYN vector) the ability of E3 Mut 2 scFvs in inhibiting FAP endopeptidase activity was found to be 3-fold higher than that of WT-E3 scFvs at 17.85 M (100 g) similar inhibitory effects of the Mut 2 scFvs were seen for FAP dipeptidyl peptidase activity with Ala-Pro-AFC substrate. however, neither E3 Mut 1 nor Mut 3 scFvs showed greater affinities of Mut 2 and WT-E3 scFvs for FAP were compared by BIAcore technology. Mut 2 and WT-E3 scFvs inhibited the activity of FAP to 30%. percentage of fibronectin fibers oriented within 10\u00b0 of the mode angle (10\u00b0 to 10\u00b0) in NIH3T3-Mock or NIH3T3-FAP matrices is shown in Fig. 8A. NIH3T3-Mock was used to derive matrices, while in Fig. 8B, the matrices were made from NIH3T3-FAP cells, all without antibodies applied. fibronectin fibers were analyzed by immunofluorescence in unextracted 3D matrices. 3 M of mouse IgG (NIH3T3-FAP matrices + IgG; C), WT E3 scFv (NIH3T3-FAP matrices + Mut 2 scFv; E) was added to the medium for 8 d. gelatin competitively inhibits FAP substrate cleavage. serial dilutions of gelatin demonstrated that inhibition of FAP by gelatin was concentration dependent. this is consistent with gelatin functioning as a competitive inhibitor of FAP activity. gelatin competitively attenuates cleavage of the fluorescent substrate by recombinant FAP. scFv phages from the repanning (round 2B) were amplified for a third round of panning. the first round of panning selected for all scFvs that bind to FAP. this includes scFvs that bind to the catalytic site of FAP. antibodies binding to FAP were identified by ELISA from randomly selected single colonies. 25% (48/192) of selected clones from round 2 were positive, while 35% (67/192) of clones from round 3 were positive. this allowed us to identify >50 distinct scFvs by PCR fingerprinting. the scFvs selected in round 2 tended to have greater diversity. the inhibitory capability of E3 was confirmed in two separate experiments. E3 scFv inhibits FAP enzymatic activity in vitro. anti-FAP scFv antibodies were incubated with 60 ng FAP-ECD prior to the addition of the Ala-Pro-AFC substrate. E3 failed to bind HEK-FAP cells when measured by flow cytometry. but its ability to inhibit FAP enzymatic activity suggests that E3 can bind the native conformation of FAP. we sought to improve its functional characteristics in an effort to enhance its functional characteristics. mutant scFvs were unable to produce enough soluble scFvs. they were expressed either in TG1 bacteria cells (cloned in pCYN vector) or in X-33 yeast cells (pPICZ vector) the difficulty of expression and purification might be due to frequent framework mutations that could cause failure of correct protein folding and secretion. 2 scFvs in inhibiting FAP endopeptidase activity were found to be 3-fold higher than that of WT-E3 scFvs at 17.85 M (100 g) similar inhibitory effects of the Mut 2 scFvs were seen for FAP dipeptidyl peptidase activity with Ala-Pro-AFC substrate. however, neither E3 Mut 1 nor Mut 3 scFvs showed greater inhibitory effects than the parental mutations on CDR regions of Mut E3 4-12 scFv were compared with those of WT-E3 scFv. affinities of Mut 2 and WT-E3 scFvs for FAP were compared. in Fig. 8A, NIH3T3-Mock was used to derive matrices, while in Fig. 8B, the matrices were made from NIH3T3-FAP cells, all without antibodies applied. the percentage of parallel fibers within 10\u00b0 of the mode angle in NIH3T3-FAP matrices was 40.44%. fibronectin fibers were analyzed by immunofluorescence in unextracted 3D matrices formed by stably transfected NIH3T3 FAP cells. 3 M of mouse IgG (NIH3T3-FAP matrices + IgG; C), WT E3 scFv (NIH3T3-FAP matrices + Mut 2 scFv; E) was added to the medium for 8 d the identification of functional antibodies which inhibit FAP activity proved challenging, as we were only able to identify a single inhibitory scFv antibody with appropriate binding characteristics. a number of potential obstacles may exist that limit the robust ability to easily identify inhibitory antibodies. the affinity of Mut 2 E3 scFv is relatively modest (KD of 1.4107 M) the scFv itself or its derived IgG may still be a useful clinical reagent for investigating in vivo targeting of FAP-positive tumor stroma. the close physical proximity of the tumor stromal cells to the tumor capillaries allows for easier accessibility of circulating proteins in the blood to reach the stromal target (35). stromal cells have fewer genetic alterations compared to transformed malignant cells (36), and thus the reactive stromal cells may express target antigens conserved across different histological cancer types."}
