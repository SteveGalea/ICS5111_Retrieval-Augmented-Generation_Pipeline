{"summary": "enterovirus A71 (EV-71) is a single-stranded, positive sense RNA with approximately 7411 nucleotides. the RNA genome is enclosed in an icosahedral capsid assembled from 60 copies of each of the four structural proteins. EV-71 was first described in 1969, after its isolation from a two-month-old infant with aseptic meningitis in California, USA. an EV-71 vaccine is likely to be the most effective way to control, and hopefully eradicate disease [21,22]. EV-71 infection begins with initial attachment to attachment factors present on the cell surface, followed by interaction with entry receptors. EV-71 uses cell surface heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan and sialic acid as attachment factors. functionally important entry receptors have been identified. scavenger receptor class B2 (SCARB2) and P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1). soluble form of cellular receptors could act as molecular decoys of cell-associated receptors. a peptide derived from EV-71 VP1 peptide was found to exhibit antiviral activity against different strains of EV-71 by blocking viral attachment to the cell surface heparan sulfate. another antimicrobial peptide, lactoferrin, also exhibited anti-EV-71 properties in vitro and in vivo through blocking viral attachment to the cell surface. the complex of WIN51711 with the EV-71 hydrophobic pocket under the canyon depression has recently been resolved by X-ray crystallography. the key success factor of these uncoating inhibitors is their ability to fit into the VP1 hydrophobic pocket, stabilize the capsid structure, and therefore block the receptor-induced uncoating mechanism [48] a series of modified WIN compounds including BPROZ-194, BPROZ-112, BPROZ-284, BPROZ-103 therapeutics targeting viral RNA translation EV-71 protein synthesis commences with translation initiation of the cap-independent IRES element at the 5\u2032UTR of the EV-71 genome. IRES is a cis-acting element that forms tertiary RNA structures and requires assistance from IRES-specific trans-acting factors to recruit other cellular translation machinery to the viral RNA. PPMO interacts with targeted RNA, especially the IRES region. it blocks ribosome recruitment and therefore inhibits viral RNA translation. PPMO readily penetrates the cells and is resistant to nuclease degradation. a pseudosubstrate, LVLQTM peptide, could inhibit EV-71 infection through binding to the active site of 2A protease. a series of 3C protease rupintrivir analogues were designed based on AG7088, with an aldehyde replacement of the,-unsaturated ester. membranous vesicles induced during PV infection have been reported to be associated with autophagy signalling. these compartments consist of viral proteins as well as microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3-II (LC3-II) EV-71 induces autophagy formation in RD and SK-N-SH cells. GW5074 may impair autophagy activation through the inhibition of the Raf-1/ERK pathway. heat shock protein 90 beta (HSP90), an isomer of HSP90, has been reported to have crucial roles in EV-71 entry and assembly. the 2C viral protein of PV consists of Walker A, B and C motifs that are homologous to the motifs found in NTP-binding proteins or in members of the helicase superfamily III [110]. metrifudil (N-(2-methylphenyl) methyl adenosine) and N6-benzyladenosine, blocked EV-71 replication via interaction with 2C viral protein. the 3A viral protein of PV contains hydrophobic domains that facilitate its binding with membranous vesicles induced during viral RNA replication [121,122]. enviroxime-like compound AN-12-H5 and AN-23-F6, are enviroxime-like compound that also targets 3A, VP1 and VP3, inhibits EV-71 infection efficiently [124]. Ribavirin inhibits EV-71 infection with an IC50 of 266 M. a piperazine-containing pyrimidine derivative, DTriP-22, was shown to effectively target the RdRP of EV-71 with IC50 values of 0.15 \u2013 0.98 M. details of the EV-71 replication steps will be discussed. the ability to recognize and bind to specific receptors determines the host range and tissue tropism. EV-71 uses cell surface heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan and sialic acid as attachment factors. soluble form of cellular receptors could act as molecular decoys of cell-associated receptors. le SCARB2, PSGL-1, sialic acid and heparin or heparin mimetics have been shown to exhibit inhibitory effects against EV-71 infection in vitro. NF449-resistant mutants consist of two mutations in VP1, E98Q and K244R. kappa carrageenan, a sulfated polysaccharide from seaweed, also exhibited significant antiviral activity through targeting EV-71 attachment and formation of the 135S A-particle occurs in the presence of SCARB2 receptors and a low pH environment. formation of the 135S A-particle occurs in the presence of SCARB2 receptors and a low pH environment, suggesting that the A-particle is formed in the early endosomes. d binders, pyridazinyl oxime ethers, significantly inhibited EV-71 infection [57], crystallographic studies showed the pirodavir predecessor R61837 complexed with rhinovirus 14 by binding to the hydrophobic pocket. 4\u2032,6-Dichloroflavan (BW683C), previously identified as an anti-rhinovirus compound, was also effective against EV-71 infection [59,60] small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting highly conserved regions of 5\u2032UTR [67], VP1, VP2 [68], 2C, 3C, 3D [69,70], and 3\u2032UTR [69] significantly inhibited EV-71 infection in a dose-dependent manner. short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was effective against EV-71 infection in a dose-dependent manner. iae inhibited EV-71 replication via inhibition of viral IRES. amantadine, a tricyclic symmetric amine previously used against influenza A virus infection, was found to suppress EV-71 IRES translation [78-80]. therapeutics targeting viral polyprotein processing Maturation cleavage of polyprotein into different viral proteins is a critical step during EV-71 infection. a series of 3C protease rupintrivir analogues were designed based on AG7088. an orally bioavailable 3C protease inhibitor, designated as compound 1, also exhibited antiviral activities against multiple rhinovirus serotypes and enteroviruses in vitro. the membranous vesicles induced during PV infection have been associated with autophagy signalling. the discovery of antiviral drugs is mainly based on virus targets. the high replication and mutation rates of enteroviruses may generate resistance to these direct-acting antivirals. GW5074, a Raf-1 inhibitor, has been shown to influence viral yield. 2B viroporin mediates the integration of viral protein into the ER membrane. a chloride-dependent current inhibitor has been reported to inhibit EV-71 infection in RD cells. guanidine hydrochloride is an extensively-studied picornavirus inhibitor [113,114], which inhibits the replication of PV [115,116], coxsackieviruses [117], echoviruses, and foot-and-mouth disease virus [118]. a single mutation, M193L at the 2C protein was sufficient to confer resistance [119]. VPg uridylylation is stimulated by the viral precursor protein 3CD. the positive strand of viral RNA is used as a template to synthesize the negative strand. mutations here impair binding of VPg to RdRP, but did not influence normal RdRP activity. WIN compounds are antivirals with the lowest IC50. only bovine lactoferrin, pleconaril, shRNA, siRNA, rupintrivir, ribavirin and 17-AAG have been tested in vivo. rupintrivir and pleconaril are already in clinical use for other viruses. enan B4 N/R Vero [38] Enviroxime-like compounds AN-12-H5 B1 0.55 M RD VP1 M119L, VP3 R227K [124] AN-23-F6 B1 0.15 M RD VP1 A224T [124] Receptor antagonists Anti-SCARB2 antibodies B3 N/R RD [28] Anti-PSGL-1 antibodies B3, B4, C1, C2, C4 N/ 0.069 M RD [52,54] WIN51711 B3 N/R RD [48] Pleconaril A 0.13-0.54 g/ml RD 1-day old ICR [56] BW683C A > 10 M HEp-2 [59] Compound 3 g A 0.45 M HEp-2 [59] BTA39 A 0.001 M Vero [57] Therapeutics targeting viral translation RNA-based therapeutics siRNA B4 1 anidine-HCl B3 N/R RD 2C M193L [119] 3A inhibitors Enviroxime A 0.15 M Vero [112] AN-12-H5 B1 0.55 M RD 3A E39G [124] AN-23-F6 B1 0.15 M RD [124] TTP-8307 A > 60 M Vero [112] GW5074 B1 6.4 M RD [124] 3D inhibitors DTriP combination therapy targeting different replication steps of EV-71 infection cycle has shown synergistic activity [131] and could minimize the emergence of antiviral resistance. new antiviral strategy to screen all licensed drugs against EV-71 infection would be more promising for clinical use. the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FP015-2012A) and Exploratory Research Grant Scheme (ER017-2013A) from the Ministry of education, Malaysia."}
