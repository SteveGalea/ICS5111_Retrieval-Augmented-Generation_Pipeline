{"summary": "many reports using a variety of animal models have demonstrated that bone marrow cells (BMCs) may have a role in the repair and regeneration of injured lung, infarcted myocardium, and damaged bone, tendon and cartilage. BMCs cultured in vitro can differentiate into type I, II, and basal and airway epithelial cells and express the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein [9] influenza viruses belong to the family Orthomyxoviridae and cause highly contagious respiratory infections in humans and animals. seasonal influenza epidemics are responsible for between 200,000 and 500,000 influenza-related deaths each year. avian influenza virus has crossed species barrier to infect humans. pigs serve as an excellent animal model to study the pathogenesis of influenza virus. in this study, we report the isolation of previously undocumented progenitor epithelial cells in pig bone marrow that expressed Clara cell secretory protein (Ccsp), a marker for lung progenitor cells. these progenitor cells expressed receptors for both mammalian and avian influenza viruses. epithelial colony cells from primary cell cultures were examined for the expression of specific epithelial cell markers. primary cell cultures were examined for the expression of specific epithelial cells. cells were incubated with FITC-labeled secondary antibodies (D) goat anti-rabbit (E) goat anti-rabbit (F) donkey anti-goat antibodies. epithelial differentiation medium is referred to as epithelial differentiation medium in the text. expression of pro surfactant protein C (SPC) was detected in the cytoplasm of these flattened cells. expression of aquaporin 5 (Aqua5) protein was detected on expanded cells. a majority of progenitor cells expressed both -2,3- and -2,6-linked sialic acid receptors. progenitor epithelial cells were examined by flow cytometry. the cells were stained with FITC-labelled maackia amurensis lectin II. progenitor epithelial cells were inoculated with SwIV, AvIV or HuIV at a MOI of 1 for 1 hour (h) infectious viruses were observed in culture supernatants after 24 h after infection. cytopathic effects required live, infectious virus because cell cytotoxicity was not observed in heat-inactivated virus-infected cultures. no viral proteins were detected in Aqua5 expressing type I pneumocytes. colony cells showed cuboidal morphology typical of epithelial cells. epithelial colony cells from primary cell cultures were examined for expression of specific epithelial cell markers. colony cells expressed epithelial specific markers Pan-K, K-18, and occludin. but not the mesenchymal markers CD29, CD44, and CD90. differentiation potential of progenitor epithelial cells. -2,3- and -2,6-linked sialic acid receptors were detected on the surface of progenitor epithelial cells by lectin staining. a majority of progenitor cells expressed both -2,3- and -2,6-linked sialic acid receptors, indicating that viruses of both avian and mammalian lineages might replicate in these cells. progenitor epithelial cells were infected with SwIV, AvIV or HuIV at a MOI of 1 for 1 hour (h) all virus types tested induced cell cytotoxicity. cytopathic effects required live, infectious virus. mocytes were subcultured onto collagen I-coated plates in epithelial cell differentiation medium. no viral proteins were detected in differentiated pneumocytes. porcine progenitor epithelial cells express both Ccsp and cytokeratins. expression of stem cell markers in progenitor epithelial cells may be associated with differentiation potential of these cells. progenitor epithelial cells were derived from mesenchymal precursors. bone marrow and cord blood MSC were shown to have epithelial differentiation potential. bone marrow MSC differentiated to type I and II pneumocytes. type I pneumocytes are important for gas exchange, water permeability and regulation of alveolar fluid homeostasis. the isolation and expansion of lung-derived autologous cells from humans is difficult. bone marrow progenitor cells can be easily isolated and expanded. bone marrow progenitor epithelial cells are capable of differentiating into type I and II pneumocytes. further characterization of these progenitor cells may help in understanding pathogenesis of infectious and non-infectious epithelial diseases and mechanisms of lung injury repair. cells were incubated at 4\u00b0C with primary antibodies: donkey anti-goat IgG, goat anti-rabbit IgG, and goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma), rabbit anti-human pan cytokeratin, rabbit anti-human occludin (Invitrogen), rabbit anti-human occludin (Invitrogen), rabbit anti-human occludin (Invitrogen), rabbit anti-human occludin (In al growth media supplemented with bovine pituitary extract (70 g/ml), human epidermal growth factor (5 ng/ml), insulin (5 g/ml), and hydrocortisone (0.5 g/ml) cells grown on coverslips were examined for expression of Aqua5 (marker for type I pneumocytes) and SPC (marker for type II pneumocytes) by using goat anti-human Aqua5 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and rabbit /NY/95, H7N2) and human influenza virus (HuIV; Hu/OH/06, H1N1) were propagated in 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs. progenitor epithelial cells were infected with SwIV, AvIV and HuIV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. cells were cultured in collagen I coated dishes for 5 days in epithelial cell differentiation medium. cells (1\u20135105/cm2) were plated in 25 cm2 cell culture flasks in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm L-glutamine, 1% antibiotic solution. cultures were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2. individual epithelial colonies surrounded by mesenchymal cells were plucked and expanded in vitro by culturing in DMEM media. CM was removed and centrifuged to remove cellular debris and used in epithelial differentiation assays. cells were cultured in epithelial cell differentiation medium containing 50% epithelial growth media supplemented with human epidermal growth factor (5 ng/ml), insulin (5 g/ml) and hydrocortisone (0.5 g/ml) the cells were incubated with FITC-labeled Maackia amurensis lectin II (MAA) or Sambucus niagra agglutinin (SNA) at 4\u00b0C for 30 min in dark. the cells were acquired by Accuri C6 flow cytometer (BD Accuri) and analyzed using CFlow plus software (Accuri) anti influenza A NP (Millipore) as primary antibody. goat anti-mouse (Molecular Probes) as secondary antibody."}
