{"summary": "the LRN is a national security asset that will develop, maintain, and strengthen an integrated domestic and international network of laboratories to respond quickly to biological, chemical, and radiological threats. the network is diverse and encompasses public health, military, veterinary, environmental, and food laboratories. the LRN-B is a laboratory system for rapid, high-confidence results to inform critical public health decisions about biological threats. more than 160 state, local, and federal facilities provide reference testing, producing high-confidence test results. national, reference, and sentinel laboratories work as an integrated network. Model LRN-B is an excellent model of an interconnected yet distributed system that has proven its value by detecting several threats. but perhaps the most successful aspect of this network is its role in strengthening the US public health laboratory system. the model can be used to develop the laboratory framework for the GHSA. CDC has initiated plans to develop the LRN for radiological threats preparedness (LRN-R) they are currently working on newer and more rapid methods to analyze clinical specimens for radioactive materials. they are currently working on newer and more rapid methods to analyze clinical specimens for radioactive materials. RN-C was to develop analysis methods for detecting exposure to chemical threat agents. the methods have expanded to include a variety of different chemicals that may or may not be used overtly but pose a public health risk. a designation level 1, 2, or 3 defines member network participation. health infrastructure had deteriorated over the years due in large part to a lack of resources, the migration of laboratory workers away from laboratories and into higher-paying positions. public health laboratories have used the funding to build, expand, and maintain BSL-3 suites. a BSL-3 suite must meet stringent biosafety requirements, including biosafety cabinets, controlled double-door access, and engineering controls. the twinning agreements were designed to support public health laboratory services by establishing long-term mentoring partnerships between national and state public health laboratories. the agreements were designed to support public health laboratory services by establishing long-term partnerships between national and state public health laboratories and linking these sites. partnership could be replicated in other countries to support the GHSA. technical assistance and training exchange visits provided a solid mechanism for knowledge transfer and capacity building. twinning model has proven a sustainable and cost-effective method for technical assistance and knowledge transfer. Detect There are 4 detection objectives that are intrinsically core LRN principles. launch, strengthen, and link global networks for real-time biosurveillance. the LRN is a critical system for ongoing surveillance of threat agents. CDC can engage with other partners to support a standard laboratory response network concept. this approach would eliminate unnecessary costs of establishing a new framework for laboratory response, use existing tools and resources, and thus increase efficiency. ASLM was established to advocate for laboratory medicine, laboratory professionals, and laboratory networks throughout Africa. the LIMSi project addresses the delay by aiding laboratories in connecting their existing LIMS to CDC. CDC is collaborating with APHL to provide public health laboratories with necessary resources to implement LIMSi. additional challenges may arise with sample sharing across international borders. public health emergency infrastructure built as part of the LRN was integral to the H1N1 response by ensuring the following: \u2022 Availability and use of real-time PCR capacity using ABI 7500 Fast in 43 state and 11 county public health LRN reference-level laboratories. much of this capacity was in place due to LRN approval for purchase of real-time PCR instrumentation using CDC/PHEP cooperative agreement funds. APHL instituted the APHL-George Washington University (GWU) Institute for Public Health Leadership and Management in 2007 to provide senior-level public health professionals with essential tools for assessing national laboratory systems. this seminar has convened leaders from all over the world for 2 weeks of intense training on such topics as organizing an effective laboratory network. state-operated laboratory facilities were aging, underfunded, and often lacked the BSL-3 capacity to safely handle agents that could be used as biological weapons. the public health infrastructure had deteriorated over the years due in large part to a lack of resources, the migration of laboratory workers away from laboratories and into higher-paying positions. the public health infrastructure had deteriorated over the years due in large part to a lack of resources, the migration of laboratory workers away from laboratories. the twinning agreements were designed to support public health laboratory services by establishing long-term mentoring partnerships between national and state public health laboratories. the requirements of the twinning agreements were: (1) approval of the national government as a prerequisite for a twinning project; (2) acknowledgment by the national government as a prerequisite for a project. APHL established a partnership specific to quality, biosafety, and biosecurity systems between the new Mexico Department of Health, Scientific Laboratory Division, and the Paraguay National Laboratory. technical assistance and training exchange visits coupled with distance mentorship provided a solid mechanism for knowledge transfer and capacity building. this partnership yielded the following for the paraguay laboratory. twinning agreements to support the model could accelerate progress in efforts to strengthen laboratory systems. laboratory twinning agreements could also be considered and implemented for \u201cSouth-to-South\u201d collaborations. CDC can engage with other organizations such as the african Society for laboratory medicine (ASLM) to support a standard laboratory response network concept. this approach would eliminate unnecessary costs of establishing a new framework for laboratory response, use existing tools and resources. the LIMSi project addresses the delay by aiding laboratories in connecting their existing LIMS to CDC. to implement LIMSi, CDC is collaborating with APHL to provide public health laboratories with necessary resources. the public health emergency infrastructure built as part of the LRN was key to the H1N1 response by ensuring: Availability and use of real-time PCR capacity using ABI 7500 Fast in 43 state and 11 county public health LRN reference-level laboratories. APHL has an extensive history of training laboratorians, including the LRN workforce, and hosting fellowship programs. the EID Laboratory Research Fellowship is a 2-year program designed for doctoral level (PhD, MD, or DVM) scientists to conduct high-priority research in infectious diseases. the process is competitive both for fellows and host laboratories. human resource development is critical to strengthening laboratory systems. APHL's domestic expertise in supporting and testing continuity of operations plans can translate into the global arena with the goal of ensuring timely notification and sharing of laboratory results with appropriate agencies and partners. 22 people were infected, 5 people lost their lives, and the cleanup cost was more than $1 billion. this article was supported under Cooperative Agreements #U60HM000803 and #U2GPS001799. contents are solely the responsibility of the authors and do not necessarily represent the official views of CDC."}
