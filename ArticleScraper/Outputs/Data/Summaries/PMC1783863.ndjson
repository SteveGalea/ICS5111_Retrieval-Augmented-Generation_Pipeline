{"summary": "results GraphDNA is a new Java application that provides a simple, user-friendly interface for the visualization of nucleotide composition. it displays multiple DNA nucleotide composition graphs (skews and walks) in a single window to allow direct comparisons between the sequences. VACV and MOCV proteins contain the following percentages of lysine (7.1, 2.9), arginine (5.9, 9.6), alanine (4.0, 9.5), leucine (9.3, 12.2) and isoleucine (7.4, 3.2) there is also considerable variation in DNA composition within a genome. the driving force for divergence in DNA composition among evolutionary related poxviruses is unknown. w is calculated across a genome as the sum of a series of sliding windows of specified length. the window size can be 1 or much larger for a complete genome. the \"DNA walk\" is another method used to study nucleotide distribution. GraphDNA has been successfully tested with a 20 Mb DNA sequence. time required to load and display a GC skew for 4 poxvirus genomes was approximately 40 s with a default window size of 1 nucleotide. replotting the same data with a window size of 10 nucleotides took 5 s. GraphDNA allows plots to be saved as PNG formatted files. the best resolution is obtained if the application window is stretched to its maximum size before saving. if the application window is stretched to its maximum size, screen images can be captured. GraphDNA was written to overcome these limitations and be compatible with the VOCs database [19] for access to viral genomes. for each nucleotide, the position of the next point in the plot is calculated relative to the current position. GraphDNA has three basic graphing functions: DNA walks, cumulative dinucleotide skews and cumulative purine/keto skews. ectromelia virus, an orthopoxvirus, genome have considerably different purine content. the coding strand of poxvirus genes tend to be slightly purine rich. the strand with the highest purine content is most likely to be the coding strand. the coding strand of leishmania major strain Friedlin chromosome 1 [23] is associated with an excess of pyrimidines. gene annotations for this genome are shown below the skew plot. genes 28, 29, 30, 31, 33, 34 and 35 appear to make up an island of unusual skew. this is interesting because genes 28, 33, 34 and 35 are distantly related. gene 30 has any similarity to other known proteins. x virus genome shown in Figure 2; note the change in scale shown. blue bars represent genes 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34 and 35. we looked at the relationship of SARS-coronavirus to other coronaviruses using nucleotide skews. GC skews show a depletion of cytosine relative to guanosine in the 10 Kb at the 3' end of the SARS-coronavirus genome.
