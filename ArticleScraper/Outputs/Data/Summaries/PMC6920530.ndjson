{"summary": "Approximately 400 blocks of the human genome have been identified as having undergone multiple duplications during hominoid evolution. overall, segmental duplications comprise approximately 5% of the human genome [1\u20133] at least half of these core duplicon gene families evolved under positive selection (Table 1), making them among the fastest evolving genes in humans. both the human lineage-specific expansion and the patterns of positive selection suggest that these gene families have played a direct role in the phenotypic evolution of humans. no homolog Yes PAML, dN/dS, The likelihood ratio test, Ka/Ks, Nei-Gojobori [13,14] 17 TBC1D3 - Usp6nl None described 17 LRRC37 - Lrrc37a1 None described. NBPF, TBC1D3 and SPATA31 were studied functionally in more detail. NBPF gene family includes variable number of tandemly repeated DUF1220 domains within their coding sequences. the different NBPF core duplicon genes are distributed along chromosome 1 in 16 copies. the macaque genome has three copies of NBPF genes, while mice and other mammals have no clear orthologs. a correlation was found between Olduvai copy number and brain size in humans. this correlation was most prominent in affected patients, but copy number was also associated with gray-matter volume in healthy controls. further studies also suggested a correlation between Olduvai copy number and schizophrenia risk and severity [30] as well as with IQ and total mathematical aptitude scores [31] RANBP2 gene family Evolution and comparative genomics RGPD genes are derived from the RANBP2 gene. RANBP2 (NUP388) is a Ran-binding protein that was shown to be a Ran-binding protein. the RGPD gene family has expanded to eight dispersed copies on human chromosome 2 through segmental duplication. different exons of RGPD genes were shown to evolve under positive selection. the macaque genome, as well as the mouse and other mammalian genomes, does not contain duplicates. SMA-GUSBP genes are organized in 2 tandem and 10 dispersed copies along human chromosome 5. an additional copy is located on chromosome 6. no homologs of the SMA-GUSBP genes have been observed outside the great apes to date, i.e. it expanded specifically in the human lineage. the PMS2P gene family is derived from the PMS2 gene. it encodes a homolog of the mutL mismatch repair gene from bacteria. the current marmoset and macaque genome assemblies do not include an intact PMS2P gene. the 5\u2032-region of SPATA31 genes acquired an additional exon and additional protein domains. this restructuring includes the integration of a transposable element (LINE/L1, PA10-12) after the split between simians and prosimians [18]. expression and subcellular localization SPATA31 gene expression evolved from testis-specific expression in mice and macaques to ubiquitous expression in humans. TRIM51 genes are recently duplicated, hominoid-specific TRIM genes. some of the TRIM51 genes (C1,C2) were found to have CNV in human individuals. the human genome assembly includes seven full-length, duplicated copies of TRIM51 (SPRYD5) genes, at least five fragmented duplication blocks. gene family evolution and comparative genomics GOLGA genes encode long coiled-coil proteins associated with the Golgi apparatus. they form a large gene family distributed across different chromosomes in humans. a possible involvement in immune response mechanisms could explain their adaptive evolution. the 'Morpheus' gene family is one of the best studied human core duplicon gene families. it is derived from a name-giving \u2018low-copy repeat sequence on chromosome 16\u2019. it is approximately 20 kb long and expanded in the great ape\u2013human lineage along chromosome 16 through segmental duplications [7, 14, 50] Morpheus proteins vary in size between 40 and 95 kDa. over-expression of different types of NPIPB and NPIPA genes reveals different subcellular localizations within both the nucleus and cytoplasm. TBC1D3 genes are derived from USP6NL (alias RNTRE) by segmental duplication. rheMac8 includes at least five copies of TBC1D3-like genes. expression and subcellular localization TBC1D3 genes are broadly expressed in many tissues and are most highly expressed in the testis [59, 60] LRRC37 gene family has expanded on human chromosome 17 [4] from a single ancestral copy in other mammals. over-expression of TBC1D3 leads to an increase in cell proliferation in basal regions of the developing mouse cortex, as well as disruption to adherens junctions. the LRRC37 gene family in humans is located at the boundary of a common inversion polymorphism of approximately 970 kb at 17q21.31 [69, 73, 74] it is not known whether LRRC37 genes play a role in any of these functions. LRRC37B, a member of the LRRC37 gene family is also a breakpoint for NF1 microdeletion syndrome. NBPF core duplicon genes are distributed along chromosome 1 in 16 copies. the macaque genome has three copies of NBPF genes. a possible ancestral gene is PDE4DIP, which includes a single Olduvai domain copy number. new study suggests a correlation between Olduvai copy number and schizophrenia risk and severity. NBPF11 genes are broadly expressed, but could have a more general function. there are currently no data supporting a possible specific molecular function for Olduvai domains in humans. NBPF gene family members include variable numbers of tandemly repeated DUF1220 domains within their coding sequences. NBPF gene family members include variable numbers of tandemly repeated DUF1220 domains within their coding sequences.

NBPF core duplicon genes are distributed along chromosome 1 in 16 copies. macaque genome has three copies of NBPF genes, while mice and other mammals have no clear orthologs. a possible ancestral gene is PDE4DIP, which includes a single Olduvai domain copy number. further studies also suggested a correlation between Olduvai copy number and schizophrenia risk and severity [30] as well as with IQ and total mathematical aptitude scores [31], although the breadth of this latter study is limited. NBPF11 genes are broadly expressed, they could have a more general function. the RGPD gene family has expanded to eight dispersed copies on human chromosome 2 through segmental duplication. the RGPD gene family has expanded to eight dispersed copies on human chromosome 2 through segmental duplication. the macaque genome, as well as the mouse and other mammalian genomes, does not contain duplicates. RGPD genes are ubiquitously expressed in human tissue with elevated expression in the testis [15, 37] function The RANBP2 protein encoded by the progenitor gene is localized within the periphery of the nuclear envelope and is thought to be required for cargo import and export. the RANBP2 protein encoded by the progenitor gene is localized within the periphery of the nuclear envelope. it is thought to be required for cargo import and export [37]. it is thus possible that the expansion of RGPD genes is the result of an arms race between virus evolution and host resistance acquisition. no homologs of the SMA-GUSBP genes have been observed outside the great apes to date, i.e. it expanded specifically in the human lineage. the genes are broadly expressed, and the highest expression (15\u201320 fold) has been detected in the testis, thymus, brain and cerebellum (Supplementary Fig. 3A-B). SMA-GUSBP genes are organized in 2 tandem and 10 dispersed copies along human chromosome 5. an additional copy is located on chromosome 6. no homologs of the SMA-GUSBP genes have been observed outside the great apes to date. PMS2P gene family is derived from the PMS2 gene. current marmoset and macaque genome assemblies do not include an intact PMS2P gene. however, the Orangutan genome includes three complete PMS2P copies. this suggests an expansion of PMS2P genes occurred within great apes. the PMS2P gene region is highly repetitive and contains multiple transposable elements (SINEs and LINEs) this suggests an expansion of PMS2P genes occurred within great apes. no further data is available on subcellular localization of these proteins. long-lived individuals (>96 years old) have significantly fewer copies of SPATA31 genes on average compared to a control group. over-expression of SPATA31A1 in epidermal cells leads to premature senescence. expression and subcellular localization SPATA31 gene expression evolved from testis-specific expression in mice and macaques to ubiquitous expression in humans. in cell culture, SPATA31 protein re-localizes from the nucleolus to the nucleus upon UV exposure. long-lived individuals have significantly fewer copies of SPATA31 genes on average compared to a control group. some of the TRIM51 genes (C1,C2) were found to have CNV in human individuals and to evolve under positive selection. the human genome assembly includes seven full-length, duplicated copies of TRIM51 (SPRYD5) genes. there is a single full-length copy in the macaque genome. some of the TRIM51 genes (C1,C2) were found to have CNV in human individuals. the human genome assembly includes seven full-length copies of TRIM51 (SPRYD5) genes. there is a single full-length copy in the macaque genome, which shows high similarity to human TRIM51EP. gene family evolution and comparative genomics GOLGA (GOLGIN) genes encode long coiled-coil proteins associated with the Golgi apparatus. they form a large gene family distributed across different chromosomes in humans. the current human assembly contains 12 annotated duplicated GOLGA6 subfamily members. ize to the Golgi apparatus, Golgi stack membrane and cytoplasm. ize to the macaque genome contains approximately 11 GOLGA6-like and at least 8 fragmented GOLGA genes. there are currently no data suggesting a causative role of GOLGA8 losses for the disease effects. expression and subcellular localization Both GOLGA6 and GOLGA8 copies are ubiquitously expressed at low levels in human tissue. there is no direct evidence for the subcellular localization of GOLGA6 and GOLGA8 proteins. there is no direct evidence for the subcellular localization of GOLGA6 and GOLGA8 proteins. the Morpheus gene family was shown to be one of the most rapidly evolving gene families during hominoid evolution [14]. expression and subcellular localization Morpheus genes are expressed in various tissues and are most highly expressed in the testis and thymus [7] the \u2018Morpheus\u2019 gene family is one of the best studied human core duplicon gene families. it is derived from a name-giving \u2018low-copy repeat sequence on chromosome 16\u2019, LCR16a. it is approximately 20 kb long and expanded in the great ape\u2013human lineage along chromosome 16 through segmental duplications. Morpheus proteins were shown to be involved in human immunodeficiency virus resistance [52, 53], but the functional significance of this is unclear. both Morpheus gene types (NPIPA and NPIPB) are upregulated upon polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) treatment. auto-antibodies against NPIPB protein in humans have been detected. expression and subcellular localization of TBC1D3 genes are broadly expressed in many tissues and are most highly expressed in the testis [59, 60] different isoforms are expressed in different tissues and are most highly expressed in the testis [59, 60] different isoforms are expressed in different tissues. TBC1D3 genes are derived from USP6NL (alias RNTRE) by segmental duplication. the gene family is characterized by the TBC domain, which plays a major role in endocytosis and intracellular trafficking in other proteins. TBC1D3 protein is ubiquitinated and palmitoylated, and degradation of TBC1D3 protein is regulated by Cul7 [62, 65]. TBC1D3 genes were also shown to be involved in Insulin/IGF signaling [66]. the LRRC37 gene family in humans is located at the boundary of a common inversion polymorphism of approximately 970 kb at 17q21.31 [69, 73, 74] LRRC37B, a member of the LRRC37 gene family is also a breakpoint for NF1 microdeletion syndrome [84]. LRRC37B, a member of the LRRC37 gene family, is also a breakpoint for NF1 microdeletion two of these eight complete LRRC37 genes can be classified as the LRRC37B type. the number of the duplication segments is variable within the primate lineage. there are 4, 7, 10 and 18 copies in marmoset, macaque, orangutan and human. LRRC37B, a member of the LRRC37 gene family is also a breakpoint for NF1 microdeletion syndrome [84]. a number of studies have focused on possible brain expansion effects for DUF1220/Olduvai repeats in the lineage toward humans. however, we show that such correlations can be drawn for all of the core duplicon gene families. all the core duplicon gene families include expansions of protein domains. this may not necessarily serve as a direct pointer toward their protein functions. future studies should focus more on this possibility. key points core duplicon gene families constitute a specific subset of gene duplicates in the human genome. they are derived from testis-expressed genes, have acquired new promoters and have specifically expanded in the evolutionary lineage toward humans. they express proteins with domains that suggest they could be modifiers of general cellular pathways.
