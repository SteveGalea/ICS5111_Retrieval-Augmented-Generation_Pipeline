GEO databases typically include both metadata and raw data from gene expression analysis. Querying the NCBI databases is the most common usage in genomic pathogen studies. a user is recommended to perform no more than 3 queries per second. BLAST is a utility software designed for downloading data from the NCBI-SRA database. it allows the user to query its sequence databases using nucleotide or protein sequences as inputs. no registration is required to use SRA-toolkit to download data. EMBL Genome databases managed by EMBL are mainly through the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) some data types are the same between ENA and NCBI, such as assembly and EST data sets. some data types are similar between ENA and NCBI. expression Atlas is a curated database for gene expression data only. a number of methods are available to query data from EMBL databases. all databases (ENA, Ensembl genomes, ArrayExpress and Expression Atlas) support text-based queries. two of the largest molecular databases in the world host terabytes of genomic data in many specific data formats. some data are in text files with specific structures, and the correctness of these formats can be checked automatically by computer programs. IMG/M, MycoCosm, and GOLD are all developed by the Joint Genome Institute. a large fraction of data in these databases are imported from NCBI Gene Bank and other related databases discussed above. PATRIC also provides analytic tools that allow users to perform genome assembly, genome annotation, proteome comparisons, RNA-seq analysis, variant analysis, and metabolic pathway model reconstruction. a user needs to provide an email address, which will receive a link to a page that allows users to set up a password. EuPathDB allows users to build their analysis pipeline through a Galaxy workspace and some user-defined pipeline that can be made public. ViPR is a virus pathogen database (Pickett et al., 2012) which provides a web interface to search genome sequences, gene sequences, protein sequences, and protein structures. the goal of the GenomeTrakr project is to track food-borne pathogens through whole genome sequencing. there is no centralized data repository for this project hosted by FDA. the results of this project are also deposited as BioProjects in an NCBI database. NCBI, EBI, DDBJ, JGI, PATRIC, EuPathDB, PAMDB, PHI-base, ViPR G. Include analysis pipeline build. JGI, PAMDB J. Require strong password. None K. Allow programmatic access. a growing number of new databases provide the users with the capacity to build customized analytical pipelines. some computational tools used in these customized pipelines may not be widely scrutinized. the most concerning problem is that none of the databases reviewed here requires strong passwords. the risk of using these third party software tools is related to each individual software and can be mitigated accordingly. a simple way to mitigate risk is to raise awareness of genomic research programmers and database managers. each BioSample typically includes descriptions of specific biomaterials. Sequence data in NCBI are also organized under gene, EST, genome, nucleotide, and protein databases. RefSeq provides genome annotations, so it is more useful for finding functional information for different pathogens. Querying the NCBI databases is the most common usage in genomic pathogen studies. a unified web interface is provided that allows users to query all databases by any anonymous user. many data sets in NCBI can also be downloaded anonymously using its FTP server. vulnerabilities in the host system or database interpreter are subject to exploitation when vulnerabilities are discovered in the query interpreter. the user is required to submit data to the NCBI database using preregistered credentials to establish a project ID and fill out a submission template file. the process of submitting data to the SRA database is similar to the above described procedures. EMBL databases have different sequence identifiers compared to NCBI databases. some data types are unique to ENA, such as CDS data sets that are found in ENA only. ArrayExpress, ENA, Ensembl Genome, and Expression Atlas all provide FTP access to users for bulk download purposes. a user can also perform sequence-based searches using REST and SOAP APIs. metadata, raw data, and processed data can be uploaded. some data are in text files with specific structures. a large fraction of data in these databases are imported from NCBI Gene Bank. a substantial portion of their genome data are generated by JGI itself. these databases also provide a repository for metagenome sequencing projects, computational tools for gene and genome annotation, and comparative genome analysis. these features are important for functional analysis of microbial genomes. the PATRIC database collects data from multiple external resources including NCBI GeneBank, genome sequencing centers, and other collaborators. a pipeline was developed to provide annotation to the sequence data and the processed results are stored in the PATRIC database. an external user can use computational tools and computing power provided by PATRIC to analyze user-generated data. PHI-base contains information regarding 6438 genes and 11340 interactions between 263 pathogens and 194 hosts. a user must register before downloading data from PHI-base. there are 5,296 virulence factors stored in the database. NCBI, EBI, DDBJ, JGI, PATRIC, EuPathDB, PAMDB, PHI-base, PHIDIAS, ViPR C. Provide raw data repository. include single purpose bioinformatics tools such as BLAST as a service or query tool. all databases described in this review provide metadata (Table 1, E) associated with sequence data (Table 1, A) and sequence data annotation (Table 1, B, D) only four major databases contain raw data repositories and some raw data can only be found in a single raw data repository. this is because maintaining large amounts of raw sequence data is cost-prohibitive for smaller institutions. data processing pipelines composed of many newly developed computational tools are more susceptible to contain intentional or unintentional vulnerable code or shared libraries. all databases require access control when users request data upload to the main database (Table 1, H). only two databases ask for complete data access control (Table 1, I) indiscriminate attacks can always happen and can cause damage to genome databases. a common vulnerability found in this review is that many databases require user email and password to establish access control. a method with a growing interest is to use encrypted databases. existing methods such as k-anonymity can be used. the attacker wishes to correlate biological data to specific users or groups of users. many genome databases have protocols for data quality control and manual curation, which are two methods to ensure data integrity. the rapid growth of the genomic and bioinformatic fields has also created a volume processing challenge. attackers have several options to exploit an unverified data transfer process. this attack requires careful crafting of records in the database to maintain a valid format but containing data without experimental evidence. this attack can be done during a single data transfer. a distributed network of permanent data providers is needed to maintain data availability. the network can include centralized control systems that can provide freshness guarantees and can maintain availability when some data providers are no longer responsive. genome databases will only grow as a target for multiple existing cybersecurity threats and threat actors. users of genome databases could lose their personal information, such as an email address and associated password. many genome databases have established local standards for data quality and metadata curation. implementing two-factor authentication and implementing login through third party accounts could provide additional security measures for the current generation of genomic databases. the core challenge here is to accommodate special use cases that are standard in the genomic research community. genome databases have become an integral part of biological and biomedical research. genome databases have not been reported as primary targets of cybersecurity threats, but many common cybersecurity threats are applicable to genome databases. research conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
