{"summary": "drug compounds are encoded with functional groups and proteins encoded by biological features including biochemical and physicochemical properties. the optimal feature selection procedures are adopted by means of the mRMR (Maximum Relevance Minimum Redundancy) method. a number of computational approaches have been developed for analyzing and predicting drug-protein interactions. the most commonly used are docking simulations [9], [10], [11], [12], literature text mining [13], and combining chemical structure, genomic sequence, and 3D structure information [14], among others. many researchers have made lots of efforts to develop useful algorithms and softwares. the protein targets for drugs are divided into enzymes, ion channels, ion channels, 630 for ion channels, and 82 for nuclear receptors. the protein targets for drugs are divided into enzymes, ion channels, [41], [42], [43], GPCRs, and nuclear receptors. Feature Vector Construction Representing drugs with chemical functional groups The number of drugs is extremely large. most of them are small organic molecules and are composed of some fixed small structures, called functional groups. a number of functional groups are available in nature, and we selected the following 28 common groups. the most typical sequential representation for a protein sample is its entire amino acid sequence, which can contain the most complete information of a protein. this type of approach failed to work when the query protein did not have significant homology to the proteins in the training dataset. however, if using the model to represent a protein, all its sequence-order information will be lost. six different types of features were considered: (1) hydrophobicity, (2) polarizability, (3) polarity, (4) secondary structure, (5) normalized van der Waals volume, and (6) solvent accessibility. a protein sequence can be translated to a series of codes according to the biochemical and physicochemical properties of its constituent amino acid residues. three properties of a sequence were used: composition (C), transition (T), and distribution (D). a sequence is encoded by the other four biochemical properties, each is corresponding to the other four biochemical properties. the NN algorithm is quite popular in pattern recognition community. if the drug-target pair with the shortest distance is a positive drug-target pair, the test sample is seen as a negative one. if the drug-target pair with the shortest distance is a positive sample, the test sample is seen as a negative one. the jackknife cross-validation was adopted to calculate the success prediction rates. the jackknife test is deemed the most objective that can always yield a unique result for a given benchmark dataset. we can quantify relevance (D) and redundancy (R) as: (5) (6) where f candidate is the feature to be calculated, and c is the target variable. m and n are the sizes of these two feature sets, respectively. m and n are the sizes of these two feature sets, respectively. the IFS curve reaches its peak with apex as its x-axis. the initial FFS-to-be-selected feature set would be added to the feature set. the feature set obtained the highest overall accurate rate would be used as the new FFS-selected feature set. axis as the index and y-axis as the overall accurate rate. k for each FFS was set to be the index of the point with the first maximum value. information about drug compounds and genes can be obtained from KEGG [46], [47] by the FTP operations. functional groups represent the characteristics of a compound as well as its reaction mechanism with other molecules. the number of common functional groups is quite small, and therefore it is possible to use the functional group composition to uniquely represent a drug. the pseudo amino acid composition (Pse-AAC) was proposed to represent the sample of a protein without completely losing its sequence-order information. however, if using the model to represent a protein, all its sequence-order information will be lost. six different types of features were considered: (1) hydrophobicity, (2) polarizability, (3) polarity, (4) secondary structure, (5) normalized van der Waals volume, and (6) solvent accessibility. a protein sequence can be translated to a series of codes according to the biochemical and physicochemical properties of its constituent amino acid residues. the three features of the code letter sequence are: C = (33.3%, 33.3%, 33.3%), T = (20%, 30%, 50%), and D = (13.3%, 33.3%, 40%, 14/15 = 93.3%, 15/15 = 100%), with a total of 21 components. for the sequence encoded by the solvent accessibility with only two states, each is corresponding to only 14 components. the protein can be formulated as a 139-D vector given by (2) where is the component of the protein. of the 139 components, 119 are derived according to the codes of the above six biochemical and physicochemical features, and 20 are the AAC components of. a drug compound can now be formulated as a 28-D vector given by (2) where is the component of the protein. the pseudo amino acid composition (Pse-AAC) was proposed [36] to represent a protein. if using the model to represent a protein, all its sequence-order information will be lost. the simplest discrete model was based on the amino acid composition (AAC) a different PseAAC represents drug-targeted proteins in terms of their biochemical and physicochemical features. a protein sequence can be translated to a series of codes according to the biochemical and physicochemical properties of its constituent amino acid residues. a protein sequence can be translated to a series of codes according to the biochemical and physicochemical properties of its constituent amino acid residues. three properties of a sequence were used to make the feature-encoded sequence a vector with a fixed number of dimensions. phobic property feature is 5/15 = 33.3% for all of P, H, and N, while the T feature is 2/10 = 20%, 3/10 = 30% and 5/10 = 50%. the NN algorithm is quite popular in pattern recognition community. if the drug-target pair with the shortest distance is a positive drug-target pair, the sample for test is seen as a positive drug-target pair. the jackknife cross-validation test is deemed the most objective that can always yield a unique result for a given benchmark dataset. the jackknife cross-validation test was adopted to calculate the success prediction rates as well. mRMR program is obtained from: http://research.janelia.org/peng/proj/mRMR/index.htm. we can get an ordered feature list with a rank for every feature to indicate its importance in the feature set. the earlier a feature is selected, the better it would be though of. an NN algorithm predictor was constructed and tested with the jackknife cross-validation test. a curve with the index i could be the x-axis and the overall accurate rate to be the y-axis. the IFS analysis procedure will be processed four times with each for a specific predictor. k for each FFS was set to be the index of the point with the first maximum value (i.e. the maximum point with the smallest index) in the corresponding IFS curve. results and Discussion Results of mRMR were carried out. .49% with 30 features, and 85.66% with 32 features for enzyme group, ion channel group,.gPCR group, and nuclear receptor groups. features selected by mRMR+FFS for the four different groups are quite different from each other. induction of CYP1A enzymes with a specific structure-stable state may activate some xenobiotics to their reactive metabolites, leading to toxicity [98], [99]. hydrophobicity plays a role in determining the coefficients of drug-enzyme interaction energy with the application to drug screening and in silico target protein screening. GLIDA provides interaction data between GPCRs and their ligands. some of the features reflect physical interactions that are responsible for the structural stability of the transmembrane. joint use of ligand-based chemogenomic and docking would certainly improve the prediction. ion channels are a large superfamily of membrane proteins that pass ions across membranes. ligand-activated transcription factors regulate the activation of a variety of important target genes. the conservative motif of the NR is typically described as three stacked alpha-helical sheets. the helices in the middle sheet run across the two outer sheets. the space in the lower part of the domain is relatively void of protein. mRMR list shows the mRMR ranks according to the feature order satisfying Eq. 3. results of IFS and FFS Based on these results, we set k in FFS to be 16, 15, 14 and 19 for the data of enzymes, ion channels, GPCRs and nuclear receptors. we divided drug-protein interactions into four groups according to the targets of drugs. the gold standard data used all the known drugs and target proteins as training data to predict potential interactions between human proteins annotated as members of the four classes in KEGG genes and all compounds in KEGG ligands. of estimated 600\u20131,000 members, is another largest known class of molecular targets with varieties of physiological activities and proven therapeutic value. they are integral membrane proteins sharing a common global topology that consists of seven transmembrane alpha helices, intracellular C-terminal, an extracellular N-terminal, three intracellular loops and three extracellular loops. polarity would play a major role in determining the drug-GPCR interactions activity. secondary structure and polarity play the major role in determining the drug-ion channels interactions activity. the drug-ion channels interaction needs gated state where they can switch conformation between a closed and an open state. a comprehensive drug-target interaction network system has been established. it contains four classifiers for predicting the drugable interaction of compounds with enzymes, ion-channels, GPCRs, and nuclear receptors. the network predictor system may become a very useful tool for drug development. all the detailed information for the genes and drugs listed here can be found in KEGG via their codes. online supporting information S3 The benchmark dataset for the drug-target GPCR interaction system. it contains 1,860 gene-drug pair samples, of which 620 are positive and 1,240 negative."}
