{"summary": "in the case of infectious diseases, it is customary to measure how far an epidemic is from eradication by calculating yet another epidemiological parameter, the basic reproduction number, denoted by R0. neither R0 nor R is regularly monitored by public-health authorities (e.g., 6], pp. 39\u201365). monkeypox and non-zoonotic measles are potential candidates for eradication through vaccination. measles incidence in the united states decreased by more than 95%. bayesian inference follows closely the principle of surveillance and learning processes. they estimated R for measles (1997\u20131999) outbreaks in the united states. they calculated R for mumps for three different regions of Bulgaria. we analyze the transmission process in terms of the effective reproduction number, R, which may change with time due to biological (e.g., pathogen transmissibility and virulence) and/or sociological (e.g., frequency of contact between individuals) factors. a non-informative improper prior (R) = 1, where R is uniformly distributed from zero to infinity. information is given by the natural logarithm of the probability to observe the given dataset T. information is presented as the sum of N contributions, one for each tree in T (i.e., an extensive quantity over the number of trees) the Bayes factor B (a ) = L ( a | R a ) L ( b | R b ) L ( | R ) (5) expresses how well the observed data were predicted by Ha,b, compared to HT; i.e., the higher the value of B(Ta), the more is justified to extract two R values rather than one from T. synthetic data consisting of arrays of sizes of transmission trees were simulated. assuming that the number of cases caused by each infected individual is a Poisson deviate with average R. in the first example, we generated a homogeneous dataset T, consisting of 100 trees with R equal to 0.6. the observed maximum is 3, indicating weak justification for calculating two R values. we concluded that this dataset should be assigned a single R estimate. the best Ra,b estimates, denoted by R * a, b, have non-overlapping error bars (95% CI) and are in satisfactory agreement with the numerical choices when 2lnB(Ta)>10 (c.f. Fig 1c) we performed evaluations of R * a, b for statistically independent synthetic datasets T, containing from 2 to 200 trees. the corresponding R * a, b values, calculated for each dataset T, are shown in the panel (c), as a function of the number of outbreaks in T. for a low number of trees, the average of 2 ln B ( a *) is less than 10, demonstrating that the model with two R values is superior. the epidemiological data consisted of measles cases grouped into outbreaks of size 2 or more. the results are presented in Fig 3. The parameter 2lnB(Ta) shows a marked maximum at the 35th outbreak, the latest one of 1998. Fig 3(b) shows Ra,b (95% CI) as a function of 2lnB(Ta)>10. we evaluated R * a, b as 0.54 (90%CI 0.43\u20130.66) and 0.86 (90%CI 0.79\u20130.93). the quantitative difference with the results by Jansen et al. [7, 21] is not significant. the posterior distribution ( R | ) was used to calculate the average effective reproduction number R and its 95% credible interval (CI) the quality of R statistics depends not only on the number of trees but also on their sizes. we denote by HT the model with a single R estimate and by Ha,b the model with two R estimates. we evaluate whether Ha,b is more plausible than HT by calculating the Bayes factor [20], using the corresponding likelihoods. we denote by a, b * the sets Ta,b which yield the largest value of 2lnB(Ta) if 2 ln B ( a * ) > 10, we accept Ra,b as the best estimates of effective reproduction numbers on a, b *. otherwise, we calculate a single R value on T using Eq 3. Suppose we add a new tree of size n to the dataset N1. the sign of the change in R is determined by the difference between the size n of the newly added tree and n. Fig 1a shows 2lnB(Ta) as a function of information in the first subset Ta. the corresponding Ra,b values are shown in the panel (c) as a function of 2lnB(Ta) we assumed a stepwise increase of R, modeling adaptation of the pathogen to human-to-human transmission. the parameter 2lnB(Ta) reaches its maximum at the 55th tree. all trees in T are generated with R = 0.6. the average 2 ln B (a * ) 10 recommends one R evaluation from T. the first half of the number of outbreaks in T has Ra = 0.6. measles-elimination programs were set worldwide, but measles eradication has not been achieved. in the late nineties, the safety of a combined measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine became controversial. since 2lnB(Ta)>10, we evaluate Ra,b. the vertical arrow indicates the best splitting point of T, determined by the maximum of 2lnB(Ta)>. both Ra,b have nearly constant values for 2lnB(Ta)>10. evaluating R before and after intervention may confirm performance of the public-health program. we also reanalyzed data previously studied by Jansen et al. [7, 21], concerning the transmission of measles in the UK during 1995\u20132002. model depends on the number of outbreaks. we solved a one-dimensional maximization problem for the Bayes factor B(Ta)"}
