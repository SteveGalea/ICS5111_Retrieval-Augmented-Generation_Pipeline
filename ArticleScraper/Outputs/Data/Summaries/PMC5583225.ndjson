{"summary": "human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses of the family Picornaviridae, genus Enterovirus, and the most common cause of upper respiratory tract (URT) infection worldwide. HRVs are frequently detected in association with hospitalizations for acute respiratory illness in young children and the elderly. Approximately 10 minor group serotypes use low-density lipoprotein (LDL) as the receptor for cell entry. >90% of major group serotypes, including HRV16 (species HRV-A) and HRV14 (species HRV-B), utilize intercellular adhesion molecule 1 receptor (ICAM-1) receptor. an experimental animal model that is susceptible to different HRV serotypes would be pivotal to evaluate the degree of cross-protection in vivo. a mouse model for rhinovirus-induced disease and exacerbation of allergic airway inflammation was also reported by using transgenic mice for infection with 90 major group viruses. is an animal model frequently used to study infections by many respiratory viral pathogens that affect human health. includes respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (Boukhvalova and Blanco, 2013), influenza (Ottolini et al., 2005; Blanco et al., 2013), measles (Wyde et al., 1992; Pfeuffer et al., 2003), and the recently re-emerging Enterovirus- cotton rats in the colony were seronegative for rhinoviruses (HRV16, 14, 1A, 1B) by neutralization assay, and seronegative to other adventitious respiratory viruses (e.g., pneumonia virus of mice, rat parvovirus, rat coronavirus, sendai virus) by ELISA. cells were grown in minimal Essential Medium containing Earle salts (EMEM), 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1.5 g/L NaHCO3, L-glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin. infected cells were maintained at 33\u00b0C, harvested when extensive cytopathic effect (CPE) was evident around 48\u201372 h post infection (p.i.) and frozen at -80\u00b0C. monolayers were over-layered with 0.7% low melt agarose in EMEM containing 2% FBS. after incubation for 3 days at 33\u00b0C, monolayers were fixed with buffered formaldehyde and stained with crystal violet. the number of protected wells was determined for each sera and NA titer was assigned on the basis of highest dilution that rendered protection of monolayer. for each plate, a no-serum and no virus controls were included. animals were either unimmunized (nave), immunized i.m. with UV- HRV14 or UV-HRV16, or immunized i.m. with live HRV14 or HRV16 (106 PFU/100 l) at week 7, half of the animals in each group were challenged i.n. with HRV14 (106 PFU/100 l) and half with HRV16 (107 PFU/100 l) cotton rats were either unimmunized (nave), immunized i.m. with live HRV14 or HRV16 (106 PFU/100 l) three weeks after the initial immunization, animals were boosted with the same immunogen as indicated. the real-time PCR reaction was performed using internal nested forward primer 5\u2032-TGCCTGTTCTCTTCCATCAGAC-3\u2032 and reverse primer 5\u2032-ATCAGGTTGAGATGCAGTGG-3\u2032. the VP1 PCR amplicon generated using forward primer 5\u2032-GGCCTCAATCTCTCTCTGGTC-3\u2032 and reverse primer 5\u2032-AGGGTAGTGCTCTGGGTGCT-3\u2032 was gel-purified, sequenced and diluted. 0.05% Tween-20 (PBS-Tween) washed three times with PBS-Tween. plates were rinsed twice with RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS. plates were washed 10 times with PBS-Tween after 18 h incubation. cotton rats were seronegative for rhinoviruses (HRV16, 14, 1A, 1B) by neutralization assay, and seronegative to other adventitious respiratory viruses (e.g., pneumonia virus of mice, rat parvovirus, rat coronavirus, sendai virus) by ELISA. Virus and Cells Stocks of HRV14 (ATCC cat. # VR-284) and HRV16 (ATCC cat. # VR-283) were produced in HeLa Ohio (HeLa OH) cells, a generous gift of Dr. Dean Erdman (CDC, Atlanta, GA, United States) infectious virus titers were determined by standard plaque assay. 100 l of undiluted or tenfold serial diluted tissue homogenates or virus stocks were plated in triplicate onto confluent monolayers of HeLa OH cells in 6-well plates. monolayers were over-layered with 2 ml of 0.7% low melt agarose in EMEM containing 2% FBS. H1-HeLa cells were seeded in 96-well plates to achieve 90\u201395% confluence in 48 h. plates were incubated at 33\u00b0C and 5% CO2 for 5 days. samples were obtained on the 3rd (black symbols) and 7th week (red symbols) serum NA against HRV14 were assayed in duplicate and NA titer is expressed as Log2 geometric mean SEM of the reciprocal dilution of serum samples. the sera were assayed in duplicate and NA titer is expressed as log2 geometric mean SEM of the reciprocal dilution of serum samples. titer is expressed as Log2 geometric mean SEM, n = 10\u201320 sera/group. a NA titer of 3.3 0.0 is the limit of detection of the assay. animals were challenged i.n. with 106 PFU (100 l/rat) of HRV14. qRT-PCR was developed using primers that target the VP1 region of HRV14. cDNA for the negative strand viral RNA [(-) vRNA] was synthesized by priming with 5\u2032-TTTGCTAGGACCTACTATATCTACCTGCTCAATCTCTGGTC-3\u2032. the real-time PCR reaction was performed using internal nested forward primer 5\u2032-TGCCTGTTCTCTTCCATCAGAC-3\u2032 and reverse primer 5 96-well multiscreen plates were coated overnight at 4\u00b0C with 1 g/well of capture antibody (goat anti-cotton rat IFN-; R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN, United States) the plates were washed three times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 (PBS-Tween), blocked with PBS containing 5% FBS at 37\u00b0C for 2 h. plates were washed five times with PBS-Tween and once with PBS. plates were read using Autoimmun Diagnostika MultiSpot reader system. t-test was used to determine statistically significant differences between groups. higher virus titers were detected in the lungs (106 PFU/g tissue) compared to the nose (103 PFU/g tissue) a brief plateau of viral loads was detected in the nose between 6 and 24 h and between 4 and 8 h p.i. in the lungs. HRV14 infection showed low levels of cellular infiltration, mostly around the bronchioles and within the alveolar spaces at 24 h p.i., that lead to mild but significant increase in pathology. i.m. immunization with either live or UV-HRV14 or i.n. infection induced strong levels of NA titers at 3 weeks post-immunization. i.n. infection with HRV14 was less efficient at inducing NA response, with detectable levels of serum NA in only one out of five animals at 3 weeks p.i. re-infection increased number of animals with NA to a total of 3 out of 5. cotton rats immunized i.m. with live HRV14 did not show heterologous protection against HRV16 challenge at the level of pulmonary viral replication. however, i.m. vaccination with HRV16 partially protected animals against heterologous HRV14 challenge. cotton rats were infected i.n. with 106 PFU of HRV14. groups of three animals were sacrificed at 0.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 24, 48, and 96 h p.i. groups of three animals were sacrificed at each time point. results are representative of two independent experiments. animals inoculated with UV-HRV14 were shown as control. i.m. immunization with live HRV14 induced strong levels of NA titers at 3 weeks post-immunization. re-infection increased the number of animals with NA to a total of 3 out of 5. cotton rats immunized i.m. with live HRV14 or HRV16, were used for i.n. homologous or heterologous virus challenge at 7 weeks after the first immunization. five animals in each group were euthanized 8 h p.i. to determine lung viral titers. serum samples from i.m. HRV16 immunized animals were tested in vitro. this result was confirmed when passive transfer of serum containing high titer of NA against HRV16 did not impart protection against HRV14 challenge. however, no detectable increase of IFN--producing splenocytes was detected under heterologous stimulation using this method. HRV16 infection in the cotton rat reproduces some aspects of HRV-associated human respiratory tract disease, causing detectable inflammation in the trachea, lower airways, and lung parenchyma. i.m. immunization with HRV14 also generated a strong homologous NA response. viral replication seems to be an important component in the generation of NA in cotton rats. it is possible that HRV14 or HRV16 replicate better in the lymph node draining from i.m. site of inoculation than from those draining from the respiratory mucosa. this is in agreement with our observations with EV-D68 that replicates in draining lymph nodes near the site of i.m. injection. a vaccine that targets this group of viruses will need to elicit an immune response that is broad enough to protect against a wide range of HRV serotypes. a report showed that immunization with recombinant HRV14 and HRV89 (two distantly related HRV strains) VP1 in mice and rabbits induced strong cross-NA response. the cotton rat can replicate two HRVs, both of which use ICAM-1 to gain entry into cells. major group A HRV16-immunized cotton rats were partially protected against major group B HRV14 challenge, indicating generation of cross-serotype immunity. splenocytes from HRV16 VP0 protein immunized mice produced both IFN- and IL-5 when stimulated with VP0 peptides of HRV14. ELISPOT assay that measure IL-4- or IL-5- producing cells could also give some indication of type of response generated during cross-protection. s of HRV16 immunized cotton rats when stimulated with UV-HRV14 is likely the result of immunization with whole virus instead of a highly conserved peptide. a more recent report has shown that serum NA against many HRVs can be induced by polyvalent, inactivated HRVs plus alum as the adjuvant. a distinct immunodominant epitope on HRV14 not present on HRV16 elicits homologous protection but not heterologous protection in HRV16-challenged animals. authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
