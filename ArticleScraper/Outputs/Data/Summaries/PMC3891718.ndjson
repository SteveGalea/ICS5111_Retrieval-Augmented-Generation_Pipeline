{"summary": "a variety of viruses have been investigated for their ability to express antigens derived from these pathogens and to induce stronger and longer-lasting humoral and cellular immune responses. recombinant vaccines should be safe, induce humoral and cellular immune responses against the transgene and provide long-lasting protection. MVbv vector is shown to express one or several foreign antigens. it induces significant immune responses against these antigens. the genome was fully sequenced from a batch of master seed viruses. 38 base substitutions were found when compared with the previously available MVEZ genome sequence deposited at NCBI (AF26629031) the difference may be explained by the cultivation of the MVEZ strain for some passages in animal cells (i.e., Vero cells) instead of human diploid cells to get sufficient material for sequencing analysis. plasmid p(+)MVb was cloned by RT-PCR from a batch of master seed viruses exactly as previously reported by Radecke et al., 1995. to generate recombinant MV, p(+)MVb was modified first by insertion of an additional transcription unit at position 2 between the P and M genes. cell-free virus preparations from infected cells were collected at daily intervals. the phenotype was evaluated according to the cytopathic effect. the cytopathic phenotype of various MV vaccine strains was determined at different temperatures. median anti-MV IgG titers (around 1:1,000) were reached after 4 weeks for all vaccine strains including rMVb. results demonstrated an equivalent immunogenic potential of the MVb and rMVb as compared with different measles strains. expression of the transgene was assessed by (A) immunofluorescence. only positive expressing HIV env were formed by passaged viruses. only negative syncytia by the control MVb were counted. the UV-inactivated rMVb2-HIV-env virus was not able to stimulate any immune response against HIV-env. rMVb2-HIV-env was applied at 1 105 pfu i.n; a UV-inactivated preparation used as control. the sequence analysis of the genome of MVbv revealed not less than 38 nucleotide deviations in comparison to the MVEZ seed D22 (MVEZ-D22) virus genome. also, 38 base substitutions were found when compared with the previously available MVEZ genome sequence deposited at NCBI (AF26629031) plasmid p(+)MVb was cloned by RT-PCR from a batch of master seed viruses exactly as previously reported by Radecke et al., 1995. to generate recombinant MV, p(+)MVb was modified first by insertion of an additional transcription unit. corresponding titers of cell free viruses produced exceeded 106 pfu/ml. Figure 2. Comparison of the cloned MVb with different MV vaccine strains and a recombinant virus. measles-susceptible but immune competent transgenic mice (hCD46tg) were immunized intramuscularly with a single dose of 1 105 pfu with different MV vaccine strains (MVbv, MVEZ, MVsch) median anti-MV IgG titers (around 1:1,000) were reached after 4 weeks for all vaccine strains including rMVb. the resultant protein was also detected in the medium of infected cells. expression of the transgene was assessed by (A) immunofluorescence. only positive expressing HIV env were formed by passaged viruses. the vector induced humoral responses against both MV and the transgene. the response against the transgenic HIV-env was around 1:200. rMVb2-HIV-env virus was not able to stimulate any immune response against HIV-env. aerosol administration of MVbv induced priming of seronegative- and boosting of seropositive children more efficiently than parenteral administration. the newly generated rMVb showed the same MV-characteristics as the parental MVbv, and exhibits similar growth kinetics and viral fitness. intranasal application of rMVb2-HIV-env elicited humoral immune response against HIVenv protein and against MV itself. the cloned MVb virus proved to be genetically stable, displayed similar growth characteristics and immunogenic potential as the commercial MVbv that has been used for vaccine campaigns in many countries. plasmid p(+)MVb The measles vaccine virus (MVbv) from the master seed was sequenced after the generation of cDNA from the original genomic RNA. PCR amplification was done using a set of 27 oligonucleotide pairs covering the entire viral genome to generate overlapping fragments of approximately 500 to 700 bp. single syncytia were used to infect MRC-5 cells in 36 mm2 dishes. further expansion of the virus was done in successively larger culture flasks. individual virus harvests were clarified by filtration, aliquoted, and then stored at -80\u00b0C. serum and sheep anti-gp120 serum (AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program) were used as primary antibodies. Syncytia were finally analyzed under the microscope and counted for statistical relevance. groups of 5\u20138 mice were immunized intramuscularly (i.m) or intranasally (i.n) with various MV and rMVb preparations (MVEZ, MVbv, MVb, and rMVb2-HIV-env) at a dose of 1x105 pfu/animal. serum samples were stored at -20\u00b0C or -80\u00b0C until use. the MV rescue cell line, 293\u20133-46 (human embryonic kidney cells),14 was cultivated in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1.2 mg/ml of geneticin. all cell cultures were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. a phylogram was generated using a neighbor-joining method. single syncytia were used to infect MRC-5 cells in 36 mm2 dishes. further expansion of the virus was done in successively larger culture flasks. individual virus harvests were collected and tested for potency. western blot cells cultured on glass slides were infected with MVbv, MVb or rMVb2-HIV-env. immunofluorescence and western blot Vero cells cultured on glass slides were infected with MVbv, MVb or rMVb2-HIV-env. confluent Vero cells were infected with different MV strains and kept for 7 d at different temperatures. the cell monolayer was then fixed and stained with crystal violet solution. pictures of the syncytia were taken using a leica microscope. a commercial ELISA assay was used and adapted to mice sera detection using the same secondary antibody and substrate as described above. cut-off was defined as thrice the mean value of the negative sera."}
