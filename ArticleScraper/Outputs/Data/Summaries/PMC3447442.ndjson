{"summary": "male Sprague\u2013Dawley (NTacUnib:SD) rats (n = 24) acquired from SPF breeding facilities of the Multidisciplinary Center for Biologic Investigation of the University of Campinas (Campinas, Brazil) were used. tic choriomeningitis virus, mouse adenovirus type 1, rotavirus A, reovirus 3, polyoma virus, mouse cytomegalovirus, pneumonia virus of mice, lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus, mycoplasma pulmonis. rats were maintained in the animal during experimental periods. rats were housed individually (cage size, 65 25 15 cm) throughout the experimental periods. the animals were 60 d old and weighed 300 to 320 g when the experiment began. rats were allowed a 1-wk adaptation period in the animal facilities. the control group was left undisturbed throughout the entire protocol. the plus-maze apparatus was made of painted plywood and consisted of 2 open arms (50 cm long 10 cm wide) and 2 closed arms (50 cm long 10 cm wide, with 40-cm-high walls), which extended from a central platform elevated 50 cm above the floor. in the EPM test, the percentage of time spent in the open arms9,41 and latency until the first open-arm entry10 are interpreted as indexes of fear and anxiety. the number of closed-arm entries is considered an index of general motor activity. the percentage of open-arm entries is related to both anxiety and general activity. the guillotine and facilities were cleaned after each rat was euthanized. each day, 4 rats from the control group and 4 rats from the handled group were euthanized randomly. the plasma was frozen and stored at 70 \u00b0C until analyzed. male Sprague\u2013Dawley (NTacUnib:SD) rats (n = 24) acquired from SPF breeding facilities were used. originating colonies were tested negative for pathogens. i virus, rat parvovirus, mouse poxvirus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, mouse adenovirus type 1, rotavirus A, reovirus 3, polyoma virus, mouse cytomegalovirus, pneumonia virus of mice, lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus, mycoplasma pulmonis. the rats were kept in the animal room of the Piracicaba Dental School. only principal researchers had access to the animal facilities. the animals were 60 d old and weighed 300 to 320 g when the experiment began. each rat was removed from its cage, placed on the experimenter's lap or on a table top. the control group was left undisturbed throughout the entire protocol. a videocamera was located above the center of the maze for monitoring the rats. in the EPM test, the percentage of time spent in the open arms9,41 and latency until the first open-arm entry10 are interpreted as indexes of fear and anxiety. the percentage of open-arm entries is related to both anxiety and general activity. each rat was euthanized to avoid the influence of odors and alarm pheromones. the guillotine and facilities were cleaned after each rat was euthanized. each day, 4 rats from the control group and 4 rats from the handled group were euthanized randomly. the plasma was frozen and stored at \u201370 \u00b0C until analyzed. differences were considered significant at a P value of less than 0.05. the results are presented as mean SEM. handling of adolescent rats decreased anxiety levels, improved cognitive behavior, and decreased norepinephrine secretion. the anxiolytic effect of handling was evidenced by the increase in the exploration of open arms in handled rats. handling increased the cognitive behavior of adolescent rats. the lower escape latency in the second compared with first trial indicates impairment of learning and memory processes in adolescent rats. a change in avoidance of entry into the open arms caused by an anxiolytic drug does not alter the escape behavior in the elevated T-maze. in the study, memory related to avoidance behavior was suggested to involve benzodiazepine-sensitive regions such as the amygdaloid complex. memory associated with escape behavior activates other brain areas because different types of memory involve different brain mechanisms. corticosterone and catecholamines play a crucial role in the response to stress. in adult animals, common husbandry procedures such as cage changes can increase the heart rate of rats. however, handling decreased corticosterone levels and the fear of human contact, suggesting that rats were able to adapt to repeated handling. treated adolescent rats showed decreases in norepinephrine and anxiety levels and improvement in learning and memory. the effects of handling are positive in adolescent rats, suggesting that this manipulation acts as an environmental intervention and may be a mild form of enrichment."}
