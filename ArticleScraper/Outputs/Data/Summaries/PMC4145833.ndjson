{"summary": "the 2014 International Symposium on HIV and Emerging Infectious Diseases (ISHEID) was held in Marseille, france, on may 21-23. the conference attracted more than 900 delegates from all over the world. the emphasis was very much on antiretroviral therapy. current efforts to provide ARVs to millions of people infected by HIV may not be sustainable. current efforts to provide ARVs to the millions of people infected by HIV may not be sustainable. rilpivirne and GSK 1265744 (744) in maintenance therapy suppressed viremia are paving the way for the testing of injectable forms of this combination. the exciting development of injectable long-acting ARV\u2019s was presented by Marta Boffito [4]. chronic inflammation is the most likely cause of non-AIDS end-organ disease encountered during chronic HIV infection such as atherosclerosis, cardio-vascular disease, kidney failure and neuropathology. the ageing process and HIV infection are associated with similar changes beside immune dysfunction such as bone changes and cardio-vascular disease. myron Cohen discussed the different prevention strategies and interventions in the uninfected and infected individuals. Factors associated with amplified transmission include those associated with infectiousness such as blood and genital tract viral load, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), viral clade and acute infection. tignol [20] discussed the new therapeutic target in Gag RNA accessible to ribozyme and RNA interference molecules. hepatitis delta-derived ribozyme targets HIV-1 RNA with long-term inhibitory activity suggesting that this type of molecules might be used in combination gene therapy or as drugs. the development of an HIV/ AIDS vaccine has been a long and difficult endeavor. the next set of antigens used in clinical efficacy studies were designed to test whether T cells could protect against HIV-1 infection. neither the STEP trial (Ad5 gag/pol/nef) nor HVTN 505 trial (DNA/rAd5 gag/pol/nef/env prime/boost regimen) could protect against HIV-1 infection, or reduce early plasma HIV-1 levels. bNAbs show potent cross-clade neutralizing activity against 70-90% of HIV-1 strains. they are remarkably protective against i.v. or mucosal HIV or SHIV infections. bNAbs develop over a few years (2.5 years average) in only 15-20% of HIV-1 infected persons. successful vaccines (smallpox, hepatitis A, YF) elicit broad integrated responses involving all effectors, including innate (TLRs), NK, Th1/Th2 responses. the question still arises whether a vaccine that does not prevent infection but preserves uninfected memory CD4+ T cells would benefit the recipient. a new approach to protect with antibodies against an infectious disease was recently developed. the 'gene-therapy' approach has been successfully tested in animal models (BLT mice) conferring a full protection against mucosal HIV transmission. a sufficiently high concentration of bNAb might substantially reduce the probability of sexual transmission of HIV between humans. only a minority of people are being diagnosed and only a portion receives therapy. making HCV therapies economically affordable in such areas of the world will become a major challenge. Fabien Zoulim's lecture on new anti-HCV agents made clear that pharmaceutical companies are still active in this area. professor Vicente Soriano [44] spoke about treatment of co-infected HCV/HIV patients. there are key factors in deciding to treat a patient or to wait. combination of SOF + RBV for 24 weeks leads to 93-95% SVR. other DAA in combination are currently studied. hepatitis E must be considered as a common emerging disease. sporadic cases of avian influenza virus infection are observed every year, mostly in Asia. this virus is a result of a triple reassortment event that occurred in wild birds. transmission to humans occurred in wet markets, mostly in large cities like Shanghai. the development of vaccines in dromedary camels might be the optimal choice to control the current outbreak and prevent future re-introduction into the human population. in 2006, many french military policemen were deployed during the major Chikungunya outbreak in la Reunion Island. in 2008, all the military policemen deployed in Reunion Island were enquired, 25% self-declared chikungunya infection (CHIK+) and 19% had positive serology. rheumatic morbidity, fatigue, and QoL were significantly impaired in CHIK + patients. a very low proportion of patients returning to their previous health status are reported. post CHIK-infection stage remains a challenge to treat. the effort to end the epidemic is now including multipronged interventions. the eradication paradigm remains well and alive with in-depth viro-immunological studies and new pharmacological and gene therapy interventions."}
