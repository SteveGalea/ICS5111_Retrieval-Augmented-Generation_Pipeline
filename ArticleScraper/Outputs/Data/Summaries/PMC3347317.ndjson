{"summary": "clinical signs include reproductive failures, late-term abortions, increased number of stillborn and mummified fetuses in sows, and respiratory problems in pigs of all ages. the etiology of PRRS was first determined in 1990 in the Netherlands and named Lelystad virus (LV). PRRSV genome consists of a positive-sense single-stranded RNA of 15 Kb in size. encoding 10 ORFs: ORF1a, ORF1b, ORF2a, ORF2b, ORFs 3 through 7 plus the newly identified ORF5a. pp1a and pp1a/b are proteolytically processed into 14 nonstructural proteins (Nsp\u2019s) interferons (IFN) are potent immune responsive cytokines against invading viruses. PRRSV exhibits significant inhibition of type I IFN production in both virus-infected cells and pigs. the current review summarizes the innate immune signaling pathways of host. type I IFNs are the most notable cytokines in the fight against viral infection at an early stage. a focus will be given to discuss how they are produced in virus-infected cells and act on neighbor cells to prevent the spread of virus. signal pathways for type I IFN production and IFN stimulated gene expression. the phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2 are detached from the IFN receptors and associated each other to form ISGF3 complexes along with IRF9. ISGF3 undergoes nuclear translocation and binds to ISRE to induce the transcription of hundreds of ISGs. the TIR domain of TLR3 binds to the adaptor protein inducing IFN-\u00df (TRIF) which indirectly activates several transcription factors including NF (nuclear factor)-B, IRF (interferon regulation factor) 3 and AP (activating protein)-1. TAK-1 also activates MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase), c-Jun N-terminal kinase, p38, and extracellular signal- TLR7/8/9 recognize dsRNA as short as 19-21 bps in size. TLR7 in human is highly expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic cells. TLR8 is mainly found in monocytes. the IRAK4-IRAK1-IKK kinase cascades may lead to the IRF7 activation. the TLR7/8 and TLR9 pathways in the endosome activate IRF7 through MyD88. the TLR3-mediated IRF3 and NF-B activation through TRIF is an additional scenario. IPS-1 transduces signals through TRAF3, a signaling factor involved in the TLR-activation pathway. this complex leads to TBK1/IKK activation, which then phosphorylates IRF3 and IRF7. the active form of IRF3 or IRF7, NF-B, AP-1, together with other co-transcription factors, form an IFN enhanceosome to produce IFN-\u00df and IFN-\u00df. IPS-1 Signaling IPS-1 has been proven to play an essential role in the antiviral signaling pathway. over-expression of IPS-1 leads to activation of both IRF3 and NF-B and thus type I IFN production. IPS-1 also contains a proline (PRO) region and a TM region that anchors to the mitochondrial outer membrane. cellular RNAs are often post-transcriptionally modified by pseudouridine, 2-thiouridine, or 2'-O-methylation. these modifications suppress the immune-stimulatory activity of RNA even if the RNA contains a 5' triphosphate. cellular RNA generally does not exist as \u201cnaked\u201d molecules in a cellular environment but rather forms complexes. the pathway that transduces the IFN signal for expression of ISGs is the JAK-STAT pathway. the pathway that transduces the IFN signal for expression of ISGs is the JAK-STAT pathway. SUMO is a small ubiquitin-like modifier and many proteins are post-translationally modified by SUMO. sumoylation occurs similarly to ubiquitinylation in such a way that a SUMO molecule is conjugated to its target protein through specific sequence recognition by E3 ligase. ubiquitin is conjugated to its substrate by three enzymes. ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and ubiquitin ligase enzyme (E3). at least 158 putative ISG15 substrates have been identified. domains are required to recognize target viral structures mostly nucleocapsid-like structures. oligomers are released and bind to viral nucleocapsids or other viral components. PKR is constitutively expressed in all tissues at basal levels. longer RNA moieties engage both RBMs of PKR and activate the kinase function. dsRNAs longer than 30 bps activate PKR efficiently. ssRNA of 47 bases with a 5'-triphophate have a limited ability to active PKR. TLR3 mediates the response to both poly(I:C) and dsRNA. TLR3 mediates the response to both poly(I:C) and dsRNA. TRIF indirectly activates several transcription factors. c-Jun N-terminal kinase, p38, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase. TLR7/8 are constitutively expressed at high levels in specific peripheral blood mononuclear cells. TLR9 senses unmethylated CpG DNA in the genome in DNA viruses. phosphorylated IRF7 dimerizes and translocates into the nucleus mainly for IFN- expression. the IRAK4-IRAK1-IKK kinase cascades may lead to the IRF7 activation. the TLR3-mediated IRF3 and NF-B activation through TRIF is an additional scenario to induce IFN-\u00df gene expression. TRIF binds to TRAF6 and receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1) for NF-B activation. TAK-1 also activates MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase), c-Jun N-terminal kinase, p38, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase. the signaling starts with the MyD88 binding to TRAF6 and IRAK-1 (IL-1 reporter associated kinase 1). This complex leads to the IRF-5 and IRF-7 activation. for different functions in different cell types, different family members of IRAK are involved. ic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I) is an intracellular receptor for viral dsRNA. it contains a C-terminal DExD/H box-RNA helicase domain and two N-terminal caspase recruitment domains. the helicase domain of RIG-I acts as a switch to control whether CARD is revealed. NF-B, AP-1, and other co-transcription factors form an IFN enhanceosome to produce IFN-\u00df and IFN-\u00df. an important question is the relative importance of signaling mediated by RIG-I versus TLRs. the ability to induce IFN-\u00df is severely compromised in RIG-I knockout conventional DCs. IPS-1 is also able to interact with FADD or directly bind to the C-terminal region of IKK and IKK kinases to activate NF-B. mitochondria have the ability to induce the apoptosis pathway through recruiting apoptotic factors and releasing pro-apoptotic proteins. cellular RNAs are often post-transcriptionally modified by pseudouridine, 2-thiouridine, or 2'-O-methylation. these modifications suppress the immune-stimulatory activity of RNA even if the RNA contains a 5' triphosphate. cellular RNA generally does not exist as \u201cnaked\u201d molecules in a cellular environment but rather forms complexes with a multitude of RNA-binding proteins. IPS-1 transduces signals through TRAF3, a signaling factor involved in the TLR-activation pathway. this complex leads to TBK1/IKK activation, which then phosphorylates IRF3 and IRF7. Phosphorylated IRF3 and IRF7 form homo- or hetero-dimer and are transported to the nucleus. IPS-1 signaling IPS-1 has been proven to play an essential role in the antiviral signaling pathway. over-expression of IPS-1 leads to activation of both IRF3 and NF-B and thus type I IFN production. IPS-1 also contains a proline (PRO) region and a C-terminal hydrophobic transmembrane region that anchors to the mitochondrial outer membrane. DA5 is required for the recognition of many negative-strand RNA viruses. poly(I:C) is often used to stimulate the RIG\u2013I/MDA5 pathway. compared to MDA5, RIG-I senses RNA transcribed in vitro by polymers. the pathway that transduces the IFN signal for expression of ISGs is the JAK-STAT pathway. the pathway that transduces the IFN signal for expression of ISGs is the JAK-STAT pathway. PIAS is also identified as a SUMO E3 ligase. SUMO is a small ubiquitin-like modifier and many proteins are post-translationally modified by SUMO. a SUMO molecule is conjugated to its target protein through specific sequence recognition by E3 ligase. ubiquitin is conjugated to its substrates by three enzymes. ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) and ubiquitin ligase enzyme (E3). at least 158 putative ISG15 substrates have been identified. the oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1) is constitutively expressed in cells at low levels and upregulated by type I and type III IFNs. PKR is constitutively expressed in all tissues at basal levels and up\u2013regulated by type I and type III IFNs. two RNA-binding motifs (RBMs) are found in the N-terminal region of PKR. dsRNAs longer than 30 bps activate PKR efficiently. ssRNA of 47 bases with a 5'-triphophate have a limited ability to active PKR. the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family suppresses the phosphorylation of STATs by inhibiting the association of JAK with the IFN receptors. PIAS1 and PIAS3 compete against STAT1 and STAT3 for ISRE within the promoter region. PIAS is also identified as a SUMO E3 ligase. ISG15, GTPase, myxovirus resistance A (MxA), ribonuclease L (RNaseL) and protein kinase K (PKR) are the most extensively studied. ISGylation mediated by ISG15 is thought to have IFN regulatory function. at least 158 putative ISG15 substrates have been identified. type I IFNs induce the expression of several quinine-hydrolysis proteins. the Mx family of proteins belongs to this class of proteins involved in mediating vesicle budding, organogenesis, and cytokinesis. PKR is constitutively expressed in all tissues at basal levels. dsRNAs longer than 30 bps activate PKR efficiently. ssRNA of 47 bases with a 5'-triphophate have a limited ability to active PKR. the virus first develops an acute infection lasting for 3 to 4 weeks. viremia is absent and viral replication sites are restricted primarily to lymphoid tissues. persistence of PRRSV is also common in the semen of infected boars. a repression of IFN- transcription and a delay of IFN-\u00df transcript accumulation in infected-microphages was shown. a large body of information is available for viral modulation of TLRs for humans. porcine TLR8 has also been identified. expression levels at 6 h post-infection (p.i.) in imDCs, which return to basal levels by 24 h. TLR3 activation caused increased antiviral response to PRRSV. PRRSV Nsp1 interacts with PIAS. PKR is redistributed during PRRSV infection. it is unknown which subunit of Nsp1 interacts with PIAS. Nsp1, Nsp2, Nsp4, and Nsp11 have the strongest potential to inhibit the IFN-\u00df promoter activity. the mechanism for Nsp1-mediated IFN inhibition is partly due to the degradation of CREB (cyclic AMP responsive element-binding)-binding protein (CBP) in the nucleus. we have been studying the role of Nsp11 for IFN regulation. we have found that Nsp11 blocks the phosphorylation of both IRF3 and IB. this leads to the inhibition of the nuclear translocation of IRF3 and NF-B. as consequences, IFN production is inhibited. PRRSV activates the NF\u2013B pathway in MARC-145 cells and PAMs at a late stage of infection. blocking NF-B activation by over-expressing the dominant negative form of IB did not alter viral replication. Nsp1 is the N-terminal subunit of Nsp1 and contains the PCP protease domain. a zinc finger motif is formed by four catalytic residues of histidine (H) or cysteine (C) to hold a zinc ion and is commonly found in transcription factors. ubiquitinylation is involved in the RIG-I and TLRs signaling. Nsp2 may interfere with polyubiquitinylation of phosphorylated IB. further studies suggest that NF-B may be down-regulated by Nsp\u2019s. degradation of CBP by Nsp1 may also require the E3 ligase activity of PIAS. in MARC-145 cells, anti-PRRSV activity of type I IFNs is highly correlated with the MxA promoter activity. apoptosis and the Virus The autocrine and paracrine actions of type I IFNs and other cytokines encompass the comprehensive host immune response to defend against viral infection. at 36 to 48 h p.i., when virus infection enters to the late stage, the NF-kB pathways are activated to assist the survival of virus in the host. the expression of viral proteins is necessary to induce a strong anti-apoptotic state. it is possible that non-structural proteins are involved in the apoptotic suppression. IPS-1 interference is a good suggestion for PRRSV-mediated apoptosis. porcine TLR3 is highly expressed in kidney, duodenum, spleen, and liver. porcine TLR7 is moderately expressed in bone marrows, lungs, mesenteric lymph nodes, trachea, thymus, kidneys, and skin. PRRSV infection increased IFN- expression at 16 h p.i. in PAMs. no significant increase of IFN- was observed upon infection. PRRSV targeting IFN Enhanceosome through IRF-Mediated RIG-I/MDA5 Pathways The abundance of IFN- and IFN-\u00df transcripts are unaffected by PRRSV infection in MARC-145 cells. PRRSV infection does not result in type I IFN production. Nsp2 is a membrane-anchored protein that contains a CP activity and a deconjugation activity associated with ovarian tumor (OTU) domain-containing protease activity. CP activity inhibits IRF3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. NF-B signaling is inhibited by PRRSV which suppresses a type I IFN response. in porcine pDCs, PRRSV promotes NF-B phosphorylation when stimulated with transmissible gastroenteritis virus. the PRRSV N protein appears to stimulate NF-B activation. the activation is dose-dependent. the region at amino acid positions 30\u201373 of N is responsible for NF-B activation. it is plausible that NF-B activation may be linked to the N protein nuclear localization. a deletion mutant of Nsp1 lacking the C-terminal 14 amino acids shows no inhibition of IFN induction. this finding raises the possibility that zinc finger motifs of Nsp1 may take a part in the suppression of NF-B or other type I IFN pathways. up-regulation of NF-B by N protein Viruses may activate or inhibit the NF-B signaling for their own benefits. NF-B signaling is inhibited by PRRSV which suppresses a type I IFN response. amino acid positions 30\u201373 of N is responsible for NF-B activation. the region is also important for homo-dimerization of N. this implies that N-N homo-dimerization may be associated with the NF\u2013B activation. a deletion mutant of Nsp1 lacking the C-terminal 14 amino acids shows no inhibition of IFN induction. this finding raises a possibility that zinc finger motifs of Nsp1 may take a part in suppression of NF-B or other type I IFN pathways. PRRSV suppresses type I IFN signaling during production of IFNs. in MARC-145 cells, anti-PRRSV activity of type I IFNs is highly correlated with the MxA promoter activity. ISG15 is an ubiquitin-like molecule and can be reversibly conjugated to proteins to mediate important antiviral responses. Nsp2 can decrease ubiquitinylation and ISGylation in 293T cells, indirectly indicating that Nsp2 may help the virus evade the innate immune response by deconjugation. some researchers have reported that the GP5 protein expression induced apoptosis by acting downstream of B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and mapped the apoptotic region to the N-terminal 119 amino acids of GP5 [96]. other researchers propose that \u2018bystander\u2019 cells undergo apoptosis during PRRSV infection supported by their microarray data in MARC-145 cells. studies indicate that IPS-1 functions as a bridge between the type I IFN induction and apoptosis. it is unknown whether the degradation of IPS-1 will also inhibit the cellular apoptosis. it is the first line defense of host cells to fight against virus infection. PIAS is a nuclear protein with multiple functions. the interaction with PIAS opens a new direction of the host cellular modulation by Nsp1. different PRRSV isolates differ in their sensitivity to IFN. the lack of knowledge on the mechanistic basis for how PRRSV evades host immune responses leads to an inadequate control of the disease. one of the key questions is whether the virulence of PRRSV is linked to immunosuppression."}
