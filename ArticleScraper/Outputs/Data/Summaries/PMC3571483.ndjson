{"summary": "gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is an enveloped positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that is the etiological agent of the acute highly contagious poultry disease infectious bronchitis (IB) (1\u20134) some isolates have been found to be associated with renal disease and can be highly nephropathogenic. a conserved sequence known as the TRS is located at the distal end of the leader sequence (TRS-L) present at the very 5\u2032 end of a coronavirus genome and upstream of each of the structural or group-specific genes (TRS-B) the TRS-B acts a signal for pausing the replication transcription complex. the negative-strand sgRNAs, with coterminal 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends, are then transcribed into a nested set of northern blot analysis of the IBV mRNA profile variably identifies the presence of a low-abundance RNA located between the sgmRNAs representing the M gene and gene 5. this RNA was originally classified as an unknown species (27) and has been rarely mentioned in the literature since. IBV strains M41, CR88, D1466, H120, Italy-02 and QX were propagated in 10-day-old hens' eggs. allantoic fluid was harvested at 24 h postinoculation and clarified by low-speed centrifugation. the 550-bp vaccinia virus sequence also contained the T7 promoter sequence immediately upstream of the 5\u2032 end of the Beau-R genome. the forward primer BeauR-L-CTGAACAA (5\u2032-TAGATTTAACTGAACAAAACGGA-3\u2032) was used together with the reverse primer BeauR-L-CTTAACAT (5\u2032-TAGATTTAACTTAACATAACGGAC-3\u2032) infectious rIBVs were recovered from vaccinia viruses containing the correctly modified IBV cDNAs. cDNAs were amplified by PCR with a forward primer located within the 5\u2032 leader sequence. mRNA was purified using a poly(A)Purist MAG Kit (Ambion) transcripts were denatured in glyoxal loading dye at 50\u00b0C for 30 min. RNA was transferred to brightStar-Plus positively charged nylon membrane (Ambion) for 2 h, cross-linked by treatment with UV light. cDNA probe specific to 3\u2032 end of IBV. cDNAs were synthesized at 48\u00b0C for 0.5 h followed by inactivation of the reverse transcriptase at 95\u00b0C for 5 min. the synthesized cDNAs were used as templates for specific PCR amplification. each 10-l real-time PCR mixture consisted of 5 l of TaqMan Fast Universal PCR Master Mix (2), 0.2 l of a 1 M primer mix, 0.25 l of probe (5 M), 2.05 l of water, and 2.5 l of cDNA. all reactions were performed in triplicate in a 7500FAST TaqMan machine (Applied Biosystems) at 95\u00b0C for 20 s. the IR sequence, nucleotides (nt) 25192 to 25459 inclusive, was digested out using introduced restrictions sites NheI and KpnI. the modified region, which maintained the first three amino acids of the putative coding sequence, was subcloned into pGPTNEB193 to yield pGPT-BeauRIR. plasmids pGPT-L-CTGAACAA and pGPT-IR-CTGAACAA were generated by GeneArt. gene synthesis was carried out to incorporate enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) or mutations 25070G C and 25074C A into the region of Beau-R corresponding to the M gene to ORF 5a. cloning of synthesized genome segments into pGPTNEB193. cDNAs were amplified by PCR with a forward primer located within the 5\u2032 leader sequence. templates were denatured at 94\u00b0C for 2 min, followed by 25 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 50\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 30 s. mRNA was purified using a NorthernMax-Gly Kit (Ambion) individual wells of six-well plates of confluent CK cells were infected with 1 105 PFU of virus and incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and 2 ml of fresh 1 BES medium was added. antibody generation was carried out by Cambridge Research Biochemicals (United Kingdom) real-time PCR. RNA was harvested from CK cells at 24 hpi. cDNAs were synthesized at 48\u00b0C for 0.5 h. followed by inactivation of the reverse transcriptase at 95\u00b0C for 5 min. all reactions were performed in triplicate in a 7500FAST TaqMan machine (Applied Biosystems) at 95\u00b0C for 20 s. followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 3 s and 60\u00b0C for 30 s. rIBV BeauRIR contains a 268-nt deletion within the IR. the IR of Beau-R was deleted, resulting in rIBV Beau-RIR. mRNAs provide a strong indication that this RNA is an sgmRNA corresponding to the IR of IBV. IR was identified as a PCR product of approximately 400 bp (350 bp for Beau-R and parent virus Beau-CK) RT-PCR products confirmed that each virus produced an sgmRNA corresponding to the IR as each RT-PCR product contained the IBV leader sequence followed by the canonical IBV TRS, CUUAACAA, as expected for all sgmRNA transcripts. the virus genome sequence is shown below, and the mRNA sequence is shown above. the leader-body junction is marked in bold, the unaligned genome sequence upstream of the leader-body junction is underlined, and the initiation codon ATG of the 11-kDa ORF encoded in the IR is shown at the 3\u2032 end. the relative nucleotide position of the ATG from the end of the IR mRNA (top sequence) or from the 5\u2032 end the 11-kDa 94-amino-acid protein sequence encoded by the IR-associated ORF is translated but has yet to be identified. western blot analysis of CK cells proved inconclusive in identifying the 11-kDa protein when cells were probed with this IR antibody. the putative coding region of the Beau-R IR was replaced with eGFP, generating rIBV BeauR-eGFP4b. images were taken at 18 hpi at 10 magnification. both rIBVs replicated efficiently in CK cells, achieving peak titers of 1.9 107 PFU/ml and 1.8 107 PFU/ml respectively. rIBVs contained point mutations within the TRS-L or TRS-B of Beau-R. the TRS of the IR sgmRNA produced by rIBV BeauR-L-CTTAACAT was CUUAACAA, the same as for Beau-R. nucleotides 6 to 8, CAA, of the sgmRNA TRS are derived from the truncated TRS-B associated with the generation of an sgmRNA for the IR. but the TRS showed incorporation of the U G mutation at nucleotide position two point mutations were engineered into the Beau-R genome, 25070G C and 25074C A, resulting in an IR TRS-B with the sequence CUGAACAA, equivalent to the TRS-B for the S gene and gene 3 of IBV Beaudette. the introduction of these nucleotide changes gave rise to two amino acid changes, respectively, within the M protein. qRT-PCR used 28S expression as an internal standard. values were additionally normalized to gene 3 sgmRNA levels. rIBV BeauR-IR-CTGAACAA IR mRNA transcript expressed in CK cells. rIBV BeauR-IR-CTGAACAA showed an observable increase in the amount of the IR sgmRNA to a level more comparable with upstream and downstream sgmRNA levels. the results were parallel by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis, which showed a 6-fold increase in the amount of the IR sgmRNA from rIBV BeauR-IR-CTGAACAA. rIBV BeauRIR is a recombinant virus based on IBV Beau-R. it contains a 268-nt deletion within the IR beginning at amino acid 4. the deleted region did not disrupt sequences required for transcription of upstream and downstream genes. RNA is an sgmRNA corresponding to the IR of IBV Beaudette. the IR of Beau-R was deleted, resulting in rIBV Beau-RIR. supercellular virus was harvested at 1, 8, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h. sequence alignments showed that only positions 6 to 8, CAA, of the IBV TRS and not the entire consensus sequence had perfect homology to the IBV genomic sequence upstream of the IR. this CAA sequence is located approximately 100 nt upstream of the proposed AUG for the IR ORF, a distance consistent with distances observed for the currently known IBV TRS-Bs. the virus genome sequence is shown below, and the mRNA sequence is shown above. the leader-body junction is marked in bold, the unaligned genome sequence upstream of the leader-body junction is underlined. the initiation codon ATG of the 11-kDa ORF encoded in the IR is shown at the 3\u2032 end. the relative nucleotide position of the ATG from the end of the IR mRNA (top sequence) or from the 5\u2032 end the 11-kDa 94-amino-acid protein sequence encoded by the IR-associated ORF has only been discussed with regard to its potential to be translated due to the lack of proof of an sgmRNA. to address this issue, a synthetic peptide corresponding to the IBV M41 IR sequence was generated. the putative coding region of the Beau-R IR was replaced with eGFP, generating rIBV BeauR-eGFP4b. images were taken at 18 hpi at 10 magnification. both rIBVs replicated efficiently in CK cells, achieving peak titers of 1.9 107 PFU/ml and 1.8 107 PFU/ml respectively. rIBVs showed similar growth kinetics as observed for wild-type Beau-R. nucleotides 6 to 8 of the IR sgmRNA TRS are derived from the truncated TRS-B associated with the generation of an sgmRNA for the IR. the TRS of the IR sgmRNA produced by rIBV BeauR-L-CTTAACAT showed incorporation of the U G mutation at nucleotide position 3. the noncanonical TRS-B is responsible for reduced sgmRNA two point mutations were engineered into the Beau-R genome, 25070G C and 25074C A, resulting in an IR TRS-B with the sequence CUGAACAA, equivalent to the TRS-B for the S gene and gene 3 of IBV Beaudette. the introduction of these nucleotide changes gave rise to two amino acid changes, respectively, within the M protein. rIBV BeauR-IR-CTGAACAA IR mRNA transcript expressed in CK cells. the leader-body TRS junction is in bold, unaligned genome sequence is underlined. the IR ATG is shown at the 3\u2032 end relative to the leader-body junction. rIBV BeauR-IR-CTGAACAA demonstrated an observable increase in the amount of the IR sgmRNA to a level more comparable with upstream and downstream sgmRNA levels. the results were parallel by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis, which showed a 6-fold increase in the amount of the IR sgmRNA from rIBV BeauR-IR-CTGAACAA and a 0.1-fold change in the amount of coronaviruses have evolved a distinct mechanism for expression of structural and accessory proteins involving translation from a 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 coterminal nested set of sgmRNAs. these sgmRNAs are copied from a series of negative-sense RNA templates synthesized from the genomic RNA by a mechanism involving a discontinuous step that adds the common 5\u2032 leader sequence to each sgRNA (14, 16, 32) coronavirus TCoV contains a consensus TRS derived predominantly from the TRS-L. the TRS-B for the IR sgmRNA was found to consist of only three nucleotides, CAA, corresponding to positions 6 to 8 of the highly conserved IBV CUUAACAA TRS. this finding begins to explain the previous lack of identification of a TRS-B associated with the IR ORF. nucleotides 1 to 5 of the leader-body fusion site were derived from the TRS-L, with nucleotides 6 to 8 derived from the TRS-B. the template switch for the IR sgmRNA was occurring upstream of the noncanonical CAA TRS-B and between nucleotides 5 and 6 of the TRS-L. rIBV BeauR-IR-CTGAACAA showed a decrease in IR sgmRNA levels. rIBV BeauR-L-CTTAACAT showed a decrease in IR sgmRNA levels. sgmRNA species produced by the TRS-L mutants did not reveal the presence of additional sgmRNAs generated by activation of cryptic TRS sites. rIBV BeauRIR found an additional sgmRNA with a leader-body junction of CUUAACAA and a noncanonical TRS-B. it was not possible to detect this sgmRNA from any IBV strains other than Beau-R and the parent virus Beau-CK. it is unclear if this sgmRNA has any function during Beau-R/Beau-CK infection. we suggest that the IR TRS-B could be viewed in terms of a series of point mutations that have arisen within the IR TRS-B in order to evolve a more viable M protein. the noncanonical, truncated TRS-B has evolved to control the expression of the potential 11-kDa ORF protein through the generation of a low-abundance sgmRNA. the IR sgmRNA is the template for the translation of a novel 11-kDa accessory protein of IBV and closely related gammacoronaviruses. it implies the expression of a fifth accessory protein by IBV. a previously uncharacterized RNA species of IBV have been unsuccessful."}
