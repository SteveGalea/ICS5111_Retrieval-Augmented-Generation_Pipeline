{"summary": "PDCoV has strong pathogenicity and can cause severe diarrhea and vomiting. high mortality in piglets can lead to economic loss in the swine industry. PDCoV is a novel coronavirus. PDCoV effectively infects cells of several species, including swine, human, and chicken. this suggests that PDCoV has the potential to spread between species and may be a threat to humans. swine and its potential for transmission to multiple hosts are alarming. ribavirin has antiviral activity against Hantavirus [20], H1N1 influenza virus [21], Dengue virus [22], and Chikungunya virus [23]. the discovery of new antiviral functions for existing clinical drugs is still an important strategy against PDCoV infection. DG pre-treatement inhibited PRV infection in a dose-dependent manner. the water solubility of DG is better than that of glycyrrhizin. DG inhibited PDCoV-induced apoptosis in LLC-PK1 cells. strain SD2018/10 from our lab was used in this study. the number of infectious PDCoV particles was determined on the basis of the 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) in LLC-PK1 cells. cells were seeded into 96-cell plates and grown to 100% confluence for 24 h. unbound viruses were removed by washing with cold PBS. cells were then infected with the same dose of PDCoV without drug treatment. analysis of viral RNA (vRNA) levels and viral loads. cthe ells were infected with the same dose of PDCoV without drug treatment. cthe ells were incubated with rabbit anti-N antibody (1:500) at 4 \u00b0C. the cells were incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:100, KPL, Colton, CA, USA) at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min. fluorescence was observed under a Nikon ECLIPSE TS100 fluorescence microscope. analysis of cell Apoptosis Apoptosis was investigated using the AnnexinV Alexa Fluor647/PI kit (FMSAV647-100) by flow cytometry. LLC-PK1 cells were seeded into 96-cell plates and grown to 100% confluence for 24 h. after washing three times with PBS, the cells were treated with increasing concentrations of LiCl ranging from 0 to 100. cells were infected with PDCoV (MOI 0.05) at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. unbound viruses were removed by washing with cold PBS. cells were then incubated with DG (1250 g/mL) at 37 \u00b0C for 24 h. analysis of the Viricidal Effect PDCoV (MOI 0.05) was incubated for 2 h at room temperature or 37 \u00b0C in the absence or presence of LiCl (60 mM) or DG (1250 g/mL) in a final volume of 1000 L. the infectious titer was determined by TCID50 in LLC-PK1 cells. using a lightCycler96 (Roche, Germany) and HiScript II One Step qRT-PCR SYBR Green Kit (Vazyme, Nanjing, China) the relative level of RNA expression was determined by the 2CT method. -actin mRNA level was used as a loading control. Flow cytometry was carried out in a becton Dickinson Accuri C6 FACSCalibur cytometer (BD Accuri C6 Plus, BD Medical Devices (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) 2.11. Statistical Analysis The concentration of drugs that caused 80% cellular cytotoxicity is referred to as CC80. the relative cell viability was evaluated by the CCK-8 Kit. the data are expressed as the mean SD of three independent experiments. the dotted line indicates the 80% cytostatic concentration (CC80) the viral titer (log10 TCID50/mL) in LLC-PK1 cell lysates was calculated by the method of Reed and Muench. at 24 h post-infection, PDCoV replication in LLC-PK1 cells was determined by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) the drugs work, viral attachment and entry assays were performed in LLC-PK1 cells. there were no significant differences between mock-treated cells and cells treated with 60 mM LiCl in viral attachment or entry based on the mean viral mRNA levels. PDCoV virions were incubated with 60 mM LiCl at 37 \u00b0C or room temperature. same experiment as in A but using DG at 1250 g/mL. the antiviral effects occur at the early stage of PDCoV replication. PDCoV could cause apoptosis within 36 hpi. the percentages of apoptotic cells infected by mock-treated, LiCl-treated viruses were 30.1%, 2.3%, 3.3%, respectively. PDCoV infection can cause vomiting and watery diarrhea in piglets. there are no records of clinically effective agents for the treatment of PDCoV infection. there is an urgent need to develop a good approach for preventing PDCoV infection. both drugs can reduce viral RNA in cell lysates at the early stages of PDCoV replication. the viral replication cycle includes attachment, entry, transcription, replication, gene expression, assembly, maturation, and release. this is consistent with the results of a recent report showing that glycyrrhizin achieved a dose-dependent inhibition of the replication of HIV-1 in MOLT-4 cells. but the specific mechanism needs further investigation. if LiCl and DG inhibit PDCoV-induced apoptosis through suppression of the cytochrome c-mediated intrinsic mitochondrial pathway, further studies are required to explore their antiviral effect against other CoVs."}
