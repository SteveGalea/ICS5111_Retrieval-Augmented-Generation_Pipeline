{"summary": "more than 170 million people are chronically infected worldwide. many will develop cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. the 9.6 kb genome contains one open reading frame (ORF) electron microscopy studies of liver tissue from chimpanzees infected with hepatitis C virus demonstrated membrane alterations in hepatocytes. the successful isolation of the first HCV cDNA clone enabled studies to determine the effects of expressing viral proteins in hepatocytes in cell culture. mbrane vesicles (DMVs) with a diameter around 200 nm were positive on immunoelectron microscopy with antibodies against NS5A and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) this was notable as a number of other RNA viruses also induce DMVs in infected cells. NS5A-GFP was found in the cytoplasm as brightly fluorescing dots and in a reticular staining pattern. NS5A-GFP was found in the cytoplasm as brightly fluorescing dots and in a reticular staining pattern [18] similar to the distribution of NS5A in fixed and immunostained replicon cells. relative light electron microscopy (CLEM) has been employed to study the ultrastructural morphology of MWs [17] and has also been used to analyze the effect of NS5A small molecule inhibitors [21] or NS5A mutants [22] on the morphology of MWs. in vitro reconstitution of a functional HCV replicase is still beyond our technical reach. however, in vitro reconstitution of a functional HCV replicase is still beyond a quantitative analysis of HCV RNA and protein content of replicon cells estimated that there is a 1000-fold excess of HCV protein over HCV RNA [29]. a quantitative analysis of HCV RNA and protein content of replicon cells estimated that there is a 1000-fold excess of HCV protein over HCV RNA. al sequences [36] are important for HCV replication, NS4B oligomerization, and DMV morphogenesis. NS5A is the only HCV NS protein capable of forming DMVs when expressed in isolation [17,22] the amino-terminal \u201cdomain 1\u201d of NS5A is necessary and sufficient for the formation of DMVs when expressed in the context of the NS3-5B polyprotein [22]. a growing list of host factors has also been shown to contribute to membranous web formation. PI4KA\u2014PI4P\u2014OSBP and FAPP2: Cholesterol and Glycosphingolipids. NS5A and NS5B can interact with PI4KA. two PI4P effectors, oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) and four-phosphate adaptor protein 2 (FAPP2) are essential for HCV replication. inhibition of either OSBP or FAPP2 results in altered MW morphology. mutants in PSTPIP2 predicted to ablate its membrane-deforming function rendered it less effective in rescuing HCV replication in cells silenced for endogenous PSTPIP2 relative to expression of wild-type protein. another member of the PCH family, bridging integrator 1 (BIN1), reported to be possibly involved in the HCV life cycle through an interaction with NS5A [53] autophagosomes engulf cytoplasmic macromolecules and damaged organelles. formation of double-membrane vesicles called autophagosomes is not completely established. ectopic expression of HCV NS4B or NS5A is sufficient to induce autophagic vesicles. the initial establishment of HCV replication was supported by a study [69]. we still do not understand the molecular mechanisms by which the autophagy machinery supports either of these processes. we will discuss candidate general mechanisms that direct MW formation in the HCV-infected cell. double-budding model invokes local bending/deformation of part of an ER cisterna with tight apposition of the two lipid bilayers, followed by pinching off and sealing to form a double-membrane vesicle. in the \u2018double budding model\u2019, a single-membrane vesicle buds by invagination into the ER lumen, from which it is subsequently released by a second budding event into studies of enterovirus-infected cells have identified single-membrane tubules [76] which could be precursors of DMVs. NS5A is the only HCV NS protein capable of forming DMVs when expressed in isolation [17,22], although much less efficiently than when expressed in the context of NS3-5B. this work also identified roles of other HCV NS proteins in efficient DMV formation, notably the NS3 helicase domain, and the expression of the NS3-4A protease in cis with NS4B-5B. further evidence for a functional interaction between NS4B and NS5A comes from the identification of mutations in NS5A that rescue mutations flanking NS4B AH1 [37] or help rescue a NS4B C-termin NS5A and NS5B can interact with PI4KA and activates its lipid kinase activity. PI4P has a highly negatively-charged headgroup and has been reported to cause membrane curvature at physiologically relevant concentrations. PI4P has a highly negatively-charged headgroup and has been reported to cause membrane curvature at physiologically relevant concentrations. membrane-deforming proteins are highly-curved structures. it is likely that proteins and/or lipids with membrane-deforming properties are involved in MW biogenesis. a protein with membrane-deforming properties has been identified as a host factor essential for HCV viral replication and MW formation. autophagy is a cellular response to a variety of stimuli, including nutrient depletion, hormone treatment, and viral or bacterial infection in eukaryotic cells. the formation of double-membrane vesicles called autophagosomes engulf cytoplasmic macromolecules and damaged organelles and deliver them to lysosomes for degradation and recycling. expression of HCV NS4B or NS5A is also sufficient to induce autophagic vesicles and upregulate markers of autophagy induction. however, whether autophagy and autophagosome induction are byproducts of HCV infection or whether autophagy itself is necessary for HCV infection and replication. it is generally believed that HCV induced MWs are derived primarily from the host cell ER membrane [10,15,17,18] most investigators have focused on the mechanisms of DMV morphogenesis rather than on MMVs. possible models for the formation of virus-induced double-membrane vesicles from the endoplasmic reticulum. none of these models has been convincingly demonstrated to be a mechanism of DMV formation. but kinetic analysis of the ultrastructural membrane alterations following HCV [17,75] infection have identified single-membrane vesicles early in HCV infection. NS5A and NS5B can interact with PI4KA and activates its lipid kinase activity, giving rise to elevated intracellular phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) levels. PI4P has a highly negatively-charged headgroup and has been reported to cause membrane curvature at physiologically relevant concentrations [46], so local production of PI4P at nascent replication organelles might facilitate membrane curvature membrane-deforming proteins are highly-curved structures. it is likely that proteins and/or lipids with membrane-deforming properties are involved in MW biogenesis. a protein with membrane-deforming properties has been identified as a host factor essential for HCV viral replication and MW formation. karyopherins and nucleoporins appear to interact with nucleocytoplasmic transport factors. knockdown of a few of these karyopherins and nucleoporins impairs viral replication. this remains to be functionally demonstrated. autophagy and autophagosome induction are byproducts of HCV infection. a number of studies have indicated that autophagy is somehow important for productive HCV infection. however, there is controversy regarding the precise steps of HCV infection that are facilitated by autophagy. molecular processes that lead to MW formation in the HCV-infected cell. it is generally believed that HCV induced MWs are derived primarily from the host cell ER membrane [10,15,17,18] most investigators have focused on the mechanisms of DMV morphogenesis. virus-induced DMVs are exvaginations connected via a short neck-like structure to the ER membrane bilayer. none of these models has been convincingly demonstrated to be a mechanism of DMV formation. kinetic analysis of ultrastructural membrane alterations following HCV [17,75] infection have identified single-membrane vesicles early in HCV infection. a role for single-membrane vesicles (SMVs) in HCV replication was not specifically evaluated in this study. a role for single-membrane vesicles (SMVs) in HCV replication was not specifically evaluated in this study. a similar study of the kinetics of poliovirus-induced membrane alterations found that the appearance of SMVs correlated best with the exponential phase of viral RNA synthesis, while DMVs appeared only later in infection [78]. the most direct evidence that DMVs are sites of HCV RNA synthesis is a study of replicon cells expressing epitope-tagged NS4B. assuming a ribonucleoside tri-phosphate (rNTP) concentration of 5 mM [80] will contain only about 3000 molecules of each rNTP. this is enough to synthesize only about one complete HCV genome. however, any model of localization within a DMV or membrane structure of comparable volume must also allow for a mechanism for rNTP replenishment. melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) are excluded from the HCV replication organelles. addition of a nuclear localization signal to RIG-I or MDA5 resulted in their replicase complex localization and stimulation of immune response. this suggests that enclosure of the HCV replicase and HCV RNA within membranous structures restricts access to PRRs. dsRNA labeling is associated with DMVs in HCV-replicating cells. it is assumed that dsRNA-containing replicative intermediates are formed as a result of viral negative-strand RNA synthesis. it is likely that some fraction of dsRNA-containing foci is not actively engaged in RNA synthesis and instead represents inactive replication complexes or products of replication. about half of these DMVs can be labeled by BrUTP in in vitro replicase assays. however, the immunogold labeling of BrUTP was observed both on the exterior and in the interior of DMVs. replicase localization within a membrane-enclosed compartment raises the question of how ribonucleotides gain access to the replicase complex and how progeny RNA genomes exit the membrane structure. rNTP replicase complex is located on the cytosolic surface of DMVs or another membrane compartment. poliovirus replicase complex is associated with the cytosolic face of virus-induced vesicles. other potential functions of the Membranous Web Membrane association of the HCV replicase complex have also been shown to shield viral RNA from immune recognition. response [85] would support a model of HCV replicase and viral RNA localization inside DMVs. this suggests enclosure of the HCV replicase and HCV RNA within membranous structures restricts access of PRRs to HCV-encoded PAMPs. many important questions remain unresolved."}
