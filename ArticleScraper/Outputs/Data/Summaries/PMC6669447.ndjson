{"summary": "ranaviruses are large double-stranded DNA viruses within the family Iridoviridae [9] ranaviruses target aquatic animals globally and have been isolated from reptiles [10,11], amphibians [12,13,14,15], and bony fish [16,17] ranaviruses are ranaviruses isolated from diseased pig frogs R. grylio (anura amphibian) and Chinese giant salamanders (CGS) A. davidianus (urodele amphibian), respectively. the complete genomes of the two viruses have been sequenced. CGS thymus cells (GSTC) [49] and Epithelioma papulosum cyprinid (EPC) cells [39] were cultured in M199 medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum. cytopathic effects (CPE) reached approximately 90%. the indicated cells were seeded in 24-well plates 24 h prior to infection. heparin was diluted in cell culture medium and incubated with ADRV or RGV for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C. at a concentration of 10 g/mL, color of the medium did not change. the cells were incubated with different concentrations of heparinase I from Flavobacterium heparinum (Sigma) for 1 h at 15 \u00b0C. the supernatant was removed, the cells were washed twice with fresh medium, and overlaid with medium containing 0.7% agarose. after incubation for three days at 25 \u00b0C, the plaques were counted. qPCR was conducted using a StepOne Real-Time PCR system. each qPCR mixture contained 1 L of DNA, 12.5 L of SYBR Premix (2), 0.5 L of forward and reversed primers. the -actin gene, used in a previous study, was used as a loading control. the aa sequence identity between ADRV-58L and RGV-53R is 99.2%. the primers 5\u2032-GTAGAATTCATGGGAGAA-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GATAAGCTTTTAACCCCTGTGGGC-3\u2032 were used for amplifying the DNA sequences for the C-terminal region (238\u2013522) of 58L. positive clones were cultured in LB medium and induced with 0.1 mM isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 4 h at 24 \u00b0C. the bacterial pellets were lysed by sonication. the purified protein was dialyzed against PBS. a monoclonal antibody against the His tag (Santa Cruz, Dallas, Texas, USA) was used as the primary antibody, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) as the secondary antibody, and antibody binding detected by chemiluminescence (Millipore) heparin is a structural homolog of highly sulfated HS. the indicated cells were seeded in 24-well plates 24 h prior to infection. the indicated cells were seeded in 24-well plates 24 h prior to infection. target cells were treated with heparinase to remove cell surface heparan sulfate. heparinase I cleaves linkages between hexosamines and iduronic acids. cells were seeded in 24-well plates 24 h prior to infection. qPCR was conducted using a stepOne real-time PCR system. each qPCR mixture contained 1 L of DNA, 12.5 L of SYBR Premix (2), 0.5 L of forward and reversed primers. the qPCR conditions were as follows: 95 \u00b0C for 10 min; 40 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 15 s and 60 \u00b0C for 1 min. the level of bound virus (MCP level) in the treated group versus that in the control group (no heparin) was calculated by the 2CT method. previous studies demonstrated that RGV-53R is 522 amino acid (aa) envelope protein with two predicted transmembrane (TM) domains. the amino acid sequence of the C-terminal regions of ADRV-58L and RGV-53R are identical. resulting fragments were digested using EcoR I and Hind III. plasmids obtained above were used to transform Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) the supernatant was collected after centrifugation for 1 min at 1800 g. the beads were washed with binding buffer (100 L) five times. bound protein was eluted with binding buffer containing 2 M NaCl. new tab Soluble heparin inhibits Andrias davidianus ranavirus (ADRV) and Rana grylio virus (RGV) infection of giant salamander thymus cells (GSTC) and Epithelioma papulosum cyprinid (EPC) cells. plaques obtained without glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) were set as 1. Experiments were conducted in triplicate and analyzed using Student\u2019s t-test. significant differences are marked with * (p 0.05). heparin inhibits virus binding to GSTC cells. cell surface HS is a viral receptor. heparin inhibits virus binding to cells. kDa Trx-His-S tag in pET32a and a 4 kDa His-T7 tag in pET28a. purified recombinant proteins were isolated and incubated with heparin-sepharose beads or control beads lacking heparin. all three recombinant proteins failed to bind sepharose beads lacking heparin. the recombinant proteins are indicated with asterisks. expression and purification of the three proteins using pET28a. the fractions of input (Input), supernatant after incubation (S), the fifth wash solution (W5) and the eluate (Eluate) were detected by Western blot with the anti-His antibody. heparin-like GAGs were involved in ADRV and RGV binding. cell surface GAGs, including HS, likely play important roles in plaque formation. GSTC and EPC cells were infected with ADRV or RGV in the presence of different concentrations of heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate. the number of plaques obtained without glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) was set as 1. the number of bound virions was determined by qPCR to monitor binding. heparin inhibits virus binding to GSTC cells. heparin was used to inhibit the binding of both viruses competitively. pET32a and pET28a were cloned into pET32a and pET28a. recombinant proteins were increased in size due to a 17 kDa Trx-His-S tag. purified recombinant proteins were isolated and incubated with heparin-sepharose beads or control beads lacking heparin. r53R-N, r53R-N, and r58L-C were expressed using pET32a or pET28a. expression and purification of the three proteins (r58L-N, r53R-N, and r58L-C) with pET32a vector. cell surface HS is an important receptor for the binding of ADRV and RGV to target cells. previously we identified RGV-53R as an envelope protein [38] this is the first report describing the role of cell surface HS in iridovirus infection. frog virus 3, the type species of the genus Ranavirus, uses class A scavenger receptors. additional ranavirus binding factors and specific cellular protein receptors may be involved in viral attachment and entry. the host range of ranaviruses could be determined by binding to other cellular proteins."}
