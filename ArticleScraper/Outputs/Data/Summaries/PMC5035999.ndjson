{"summary": "TRIM52 exerts antiviral activity against JEV replication in BHK-21 and 293T cells. TRIM52 expression impairs JEV infection in BHK-21 and 293T cells. the cells were transfected with 2 g of TRIM52 expression plasmids for 30 h. indicated experiments were performed to evaluate the antiviral activity of TRIM52 against JEV infection. production of progeny virus in culture supernatants of BHK-21 and 293T cells was measured by plaque assay. Western blot analysis of protein level of JEV NS3 in BHK-21 and 293T cells by using the indicated antibodies. 293T cells were co-transfected with expression plasmids encoding HA-TRIM52 plus NS2A-Flag. the cells were harvested at 36 hpt, and the cell lysates were prepared for Western blot analysis using the indicated antibodies. the results showed that GST-TRIM52 but not GST protein could capture NS2A. TRIM52 interacted with JEV viral NS2A via a direct physical interaction. TRIM52 self-ubiquitylation in 293T cells. 293T cells were co-transfected with flag-tagged full length TRIM52. RING domain deleted TRIM52 (TRIM52-dR) and empty vector. the cells were harvested at 30 hpt for ubiquitination assay. 293T cells were co-transfected with 50 ng of NS2A-expressing plasmid. proteasome inhibitor MG132 (10 M) or dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) was added at 24 hpt. NS2A protein levels were rescued by MG132 treatment. the 293T cells were co-transfected with 50 ng of NS2A-expressing plasmid plus 2000 ng of TRIM52-encoding plasmid or with empty vector. the protein levels of TRIM52, and NS2A were evaluated by Western blot analysis. TRIM52-meidated degradation of NS2A protein is proteasome pathway dependent. 293T cells were co-transfected with plasmid encoding NS2A-Flag plus V5-TRIM52. after 30 hpt, the cells were harvested and an IP was performed using anti-Flag affinity gel. TRIM52 induces ubiquitination of NS2A. NS2A-Flag (2000 ng) was co-expressed with HA-Ubi (1000 ng) and with increasing amounts of TRIM52-V5 in 293T cells. progeny virus in culture supernatants was collected at 24 hpi. cells with full-length TRIM52 showed an obviously reduced viral production compared with cells with TRIM52dR and empty vector control. RING domain of TRIM52 is required for its antiviral activity against JEV replication. TRIM52 expression impairs JEV replication in BHK-21 and 293T cells. the cells were transfected with 2 g of TRIM52 expression plasmids or with an empty vector for 30 h. the cells and supernatants were collected at 24 h post-infection. virus in culture supernatants of BHK-21 and 293T cells was measured by plaque assay. Western blot analysis of protein level of JEV NS3 in BHK-21 and 293T cells. a statistical difference exists between empty vector and TRIM52 expression cells at P 0.001. 293T cells were co-transfected with plasmids expressing HA-TRIM52 plus NS2A-Flag. the cells were fixed at 24 hpt and subjected to immunofluorescence. images were obtained using confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.) TRIM52 self-ubiquitylation in 293T cells We performed an in vivo ubiquitylation assay in 293T cells to evaluate the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of the RING finger domain of TRIM52. the cells were co-transfected with Flag-tagged TRIM52 with or without HA-tagged ubiquitin. smear signals in TRIM52 RING domain-deleted mutant significantly decreased. results suggest that TRIM52 self-ubiquitylated in 293T cells. TRIM52 mediated the ubiquitylation of its interaction proteins. proteasome inhibitor MG132 (10 M) or dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) was added at 24 hpt. NS2A protein levels significantly decreased in the presence of TRIM52 without MG132 treatment. RING domain lacking TRIM52-encoding plasmid or with empty vector. the cells were collected at 30 hpt, and the protein levels of TRIM52, and NS2A were evaluated. GAPDH was used as normalizer, and relative quantification of detected signal was analyzed using Image J software. we did not observe any rescue of NS2A in the presence of NH4Cl (20 mM), whereas MG132 restored NS2A protein level to DMSO and NH4Cl treatment group. TRIM52-meidated degradation of NS2A is proteasome pathway dependent. TRIM52 induces NS2A ubiquitination. NS2A-Flag (2000 ng) was co-expressed with HA-Ubi (1000 ng) and with increasing amounts of TRIM52-V5 (500 ng, 2000 ng) in 293T cells. with full-length TRIM52 showed an obviously reduced viral production compared with cells with TRIM52dR and empty vector control. however, viral production in cells with TRIM52dR versus empty vector control did not vary. RING domain of TRIM52 is required for its antiviral activity against JEV replication. activity against bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV)31, yellow fever virus (YFV), dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV2), human coronavirus virus (HCoV)32, and influenza A and B viruses33. TRIM proteins directly target viral proteins to restrict virus replication. antiviral mechanisms of TRIM56 restricting YFV and DENV remain unknown. TRIM21 is a negative regulator of IFN production mediated by IRF3 during JEV infection. TRIM52 is an unusual member of the TRIM family proteins. NS2A specifically inhibits double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase PKR mediated antiviral response39. ectopic overexpression of TRIM52 inhibits JEV replication in BHK-21 and 293T cells. TRIM52 directly interacted with JEV NS2A protein. human embryonic kidney 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco\u2019s modified essential medium (DMEM; Invitrogen, USA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco), 100 U/ml penicillin (GENVIEW) and 10 g/ml streptomycin sulfate (GENVIEW) at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. cDNA encoding full-length NS1, NS2A, NS4B, and NS5 from JEV45 were cloned into pCR3.1/3Flag or pCAGGS-HA vector. cDNA-encoding full length human TRIM52 or TRIM52 RING domain truncation (TRIM52dR) were cloned into pGEX-4T-1. the mRNA levels of JEV C genes were determined by relative quantitative real-time PCR by using SYBR Green Real-time PCR Master Mix (TOYOBO) all reactions were performed in triplicate and the mRNA level of the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as endogenous reference control. the membranes were incubated with diluted primary antibodies at RT or at 4 \u00b0C for 2 or 16 h. anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG antibodies conjugated to HRP were used as secondary antibodies. the cells were washed again three times with PBS and then incubated with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenyl-indole (DAPI, Sigma) for 5 min. Fluorescent images were obtained using a confocal laser scanning microscope. horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) secondary antibodies were obtained from Boster Bioengineering Ltd (China) Rabbit anti-JEV NS3 polyclonal antibodies and EasyBlot anti mouse IgG (HRP) were acquired from GeneTex Inc (USA) the progeny virus titers were measured using plaque forming unit (PFU) assay. the plaques were visualized 4 days (d) post-infection (p.i.) by fixing with 10% formaldehyde. immunoblotting and IP Cells were treated with lysis buffer containing 1.19% HEPES, 0.88% NaCl, 0.04% EDTA, 1% NP40 and a protease inhibitor (Roche, UK) the protein concentration of whole-cell lysates was determined using bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific) washed five times with cold lysis buffer prior to elution by incubation at 95 \u00b0C in 1 sample buffer (62.5 mM TRIS [pH 6.8], 10% glycerol, 15 mM EDTA, 4% 2-ME, 2% SDS, and bromophenol blue) the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 at RT for 10 min. ing the viral NS2A.
