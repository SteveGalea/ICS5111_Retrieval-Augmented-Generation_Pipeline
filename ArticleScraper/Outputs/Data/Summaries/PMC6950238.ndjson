{"summary": "ECoV belongs to the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae of the order Nidovirales. they are classified into four genera (alpha-, beta-, gamma- and deltacoronavirus) they infect both mammalian and avian hosts. ECoV was isolated from a two-week-old diarrheic foal in 1999. real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) methods have been established. ECoV viral nucleic acid is generally only detectable by qPCR within a limited timeframe of 3\u20139 days post infection. serological assays can be used to support diagnosis of a clinical ECoV infection by showing seroconversion or a significant increase in antibody titer in paired serum samples. the N-terminal S1 subunit is responsible for receptor binding, while the C-terminal S2 subunit mediates membrane fusion. the S1 subunit is the most variable immunogenic antigen among coronaviruses, and therefore it is an ideal candidate for the detection of coV species-specific antibodies. the aim of the study was to develop and validate an ELISA method for the detection of specific antibodies to ECoV. 81 21 25.90 E WNV surveillance 2015 The Netherlands 176 145 82.40 F EIA surveillance 2015 The Netherlands 165 93 56.40 H Horse sera from Iceland 2018 Iceland 100 62 62.00 2.2. cells and Virus ECoV strain NC99 was propagated and titrated in human rectal adenocarcinoma (HRT-18G cells) ethyleneimine (Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA, USA) was removed and replaced by 293 SFM II expression medium (Gibco\u00ae, Life Technologies Inc., Grand Island, NY, USA) at six days post transfection, cell culture supernatants were harvested and the soluble S1 was purified from the culture medium using Protein A Sepharose beads. the proteins were eluted using 0.1M citric acid, pH 3.0, and immediately neutralized with 1 96-well cell culture plates were coated with ECoV S1 protein (100 L per well) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) overnight at 4 \u00b0C. plates were blocked with PBST containing 5% milk powder for 2 h. 100 L/well 1:20,000 diluted horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-horse IgG (H&L) was added to detect bound antibodies. plates were incubated for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. the reaction was stopped by adding 12.5% sulfuric acid. optical densities were immediately measured at 450 nm. the optimal protein amount and dilution of secondary antibody conjugate were determined by checkerboard titration. plates were incubated with serum samples 100 L per well and diluted 1:200 in PBS + 0.05% Tween-20 + 2.5% dry milk for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. the cut-off value, diagnostic specificity and sensitivity were determined by ROC analysis using Sigmaplot. a minimum specificity of 99% was chosen for the selection of cut-off values. the reproducibility of assays was evaluated by testing three samples with different OD values. cells and Virus ECoV strain NC99 was propagated and titrated in human rectal adenocarcinoma (HRT-18G) cells and human embryonic kidney 293 cells stably expressing the SV40 large T antigen (HEK-293T) were maintained in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM, Lonza, Basel, Switzerland). HEK-293T cells using polyethyleneimine (Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA, USA) in a ratio of 1:10. after 6 h of incubation, the transfection medium was replaced by 293 SFM II expression medium (Gibco\u00ae, Life Technologies Inc., Grand Island, NY, USA) at six days post transfection, cell culture supernatants were harvested and the soluble S1 was purified. virus\u2013serum mixtures were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 60 min. 100 L of the virus\u2013serum mixture was added in duplicate to HRT-18G cells monolayers. at six days post infection, a clear cytopathic effect was observed. 100 L/well 1:20,000 diluted horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-horse IgG (H&L) was added to detect bound antibodies and plates were incubated for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. the reaction was stopped by adding 12.5% sulfuric acid (H2SO4 (VWR International BV, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) plates were dried for four hours at 37 \u00b0C, vacuum sealed and stored at 4\u20138 \u00b0C. optimal protein amount and dilution of secondary antibody conjugate were determined by checkerboard titration. plates were coated with ECoV S1 protein (100 L per well) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) overnight at 4 \u00b0C. optimal protein amount and dilution of secondary antibody conjugate were determined by checkerboard titration. plates were coated with ECoV S1 protein (100 L per well) in ammoniumcarbonate solution overnight at 4 \u00b0C. plates were dried for four hours at 37 \u00b0C, vacuum sealed and stored at 4\u20138 \u00b0C. the peroxidase reaction was visualized by incubating plates with TMB. the reaction was stopped by adding 50 L/well sulfuric acid. optical densities were immediately measured at 450 nm using an ELISA microplate reader. paired samples from 27 horses (n = 54, panel I) were tested in the VN assay. twenty out of 27 sera collected from the first time point exhibit titers ranging from 12 to 2048. wet format ELISA (wELISA) and dry format ELISA (dELISA) were plotted with positive (n = 137) and negative (n = 94) sera. the optimal cut-off values, diagnostic specificity and sensitivity were determined by the established ROC curves. the area under the curve (AUC) is 0.985 for both ELISA formats. distributions of wELISA (C) and dELISA (D) with confirmed sera are shown. the inter- and intra-coefficient of variation (CV) of the three ECoV positive sera tested with both ELISA formats were lower than 12%. seroconversion rates calculated from wELISA and VNT showed a 100% correlation. nine of the acute phase sera had positive OD values between 0.35 and 0.70 (2x background) and also a higher than 2 (n = 2) to 4 (n = 7) fold increase in OD value. ELISA reactivities (A) and VNT (B) of 27 horses from acute and convalescent-phase sera. each cut-off is indicated by the dotted line; VNT, virus neutralization titer. 24 horse sera with positive ECoV S1 ELISA results were tested in ECoV neutralization assays. all of them had neutralizing antibodies with titers varying between 32 and 768. the diagnostic performance of both ELISAs was evaluated using a subset of 231 horse sera with known VN results. the optimal cut-off values, diagnostic specificity and sensitivity of both ELISA formats were determined by the established ROC curves. a cut-off at an S/P value of 0.13 yielded a sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 99%. intra- and intra-coefficient of variation (CV) of the three ECoV positive sera tested with both ELISA formats were lower than 12%. the inter-assay CV of wELISA and dELISA ranged from 3.04% to 4.87%. the inter-assay CV of wELISA and dELISA varied from 4.9% to 10.26% and from 8.9% to 11.2%, respectively. five of the VNT positive paired serum samples had OD values of >0.70 (twice the background OD value) in the acute phase serum. two of these samples with an OD value of 1.12 and 1.41 respectively in wELISA also showed a greater than 2-fold increase in OD value. a total of 1084 serum samples (Table 1, panel A\u2013H) were analyzed. all sera were from adult horses (older than 36 months) the lowest number of positive samples was found in panel D. our ELISA method with both formats performed equally well. dELISA was further validated and used for high-throughput screening of serum samples. ECoV S1 is a highly suitable antigen for the detection of antibodies against ECoV. dELISA is a useful diagnostic test for the demonstration of a potential ECoV outbreak. results showed that the overall seroprevalence in the different cohorts tested is 25.9%\u201382.8%. a lower percentage (9.6%) of positive animals was found in another ECoV seroprevalence study conducted in the USA [33] study used negative qRT-PCR and absence of clinical signs as criteria to define horses as ECoV negative. in the group of young horses, the lowest seroprevalence was found. young horses may initially be protected against ECoV by maternal antibodies. risk of becoming infected increases with age. we developed a high-throughput, reliable and specific ELISA method to study humoral immune responses in horses against ECoV. with this method, we are able to perform the serodiagnosis of ECoV infection and assess the seroprevalence within horse populations."}
