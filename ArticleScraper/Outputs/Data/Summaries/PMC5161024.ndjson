{"summary": "avian leucosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) causes immunosuppression and can induce tumors in infected chickens. there is no available vaccine to prevent ALV-J infection and new virus strains are often isolated in china and other parts of the world. chicken macrophages are resistant to infection by common avian oncogenic viruses such as infectious bronchitis virus, Marek's disease virus, and reticuloendotheliosis virus. cytokine responses such as type I interferon (IFN) production are induced by the low pathogenicity avian influenza virus (LPAIV) in macrophage-like cells. chickens infected with SCAU-HN06 strain can induce hemangiomas. whole blood samples were collected in EDTA anticoagulation tubes with negative pressure via jugular venipuncture. blood volumes never exceeded 3% of total blood volume. the mouse anti-chicken monocyte/macrophage antibody KUL01-FITC was used to evaluate the cell surface expression of markers typically expressed on chicken macrophage by flow cytometry. a mouse anti-MHC Class II monoclonal antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) that cross-react with chicken was also used to examine MDM cells by flow cytometry. DF1 cells were used as a control and infected as described above for MDM. DNA was extracted from MDM after 3 to 36 h infection using a commercial kit. PCR primers were employed to identify ALV-J. the cells were washed extensively to remove excess FITC-dextran. cDNA was synthesized using the RNAfast200 kit. qRT-PCR was performed on a bio-Rad CFX96 real-time Detection system. the results were presented as means SEM. the statistical significance was represented by P values of 0.05, 0.01, or 0.001. all animal procedures were performed according to the regulations and guidelines established by this committee. 5% chicken serum, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin were added to the remaining adherent cells which were primarily monocytes. the culture medium was changed every 2 d in order to ensure stable and consistent conditions. samples were tested for ALV group-specific antigen (p27) by antigen-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) the results were expressed as s/p ratios where s/p = (Sample Mean \u2013Kit Negative Control Mean) DF1 cells were used as a control and infected as described above for MDM. infected and uninfected MDM cells were then incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. cells were washed extensively to remove excess FITC-dextran. cDNA was synthesized using the RNAfast200 kit. IFN-, IL-1, IL-6, and IL-10 were examined by ELISA using a commercial kit (USCN, Wuhan, China) the significance of the variability among the trials was analyzed by GraphPad Prism (version 5.0) software. cultured MDM cells were stained with monoclonal antibody KUL01-FITC and MHC-II and analyzed using flow cytometry. the chicken fibroblast cell line DF1 was developed from line 0 (EV-0) chick embryo and is susceptible only to exogenous ALV. PCR tests of MDM after 3 to 36 h infection using ALV-J-specific primers were all positive. NO Production after SCAU-HN06 Infection Supernatants from the MDM cells infected with SCAU-HN06 at 12, 24, and 36 h post infection (hpi) were tested for the presence of NO. expression of interferon-stimulated genes at 6 hpi and Mx at 3 and 6 hpi in infected MDM cells were significantly up-regulated compared to controls. however, the transcription of these genes was significantly down-regulated at 36 hpi (ISG12) and 24 and 36 hpi (Mx) respectively. characterization of cultured chicken MDM monocytes after 6 days in culture showed clear and distinct macrophage-like morphologies. as the cytoplasmic volume of these cells increased, the MDM cells spread on the plate surface and exhibited cytoplasmic vacuolation coupled with a reduction in the nucleo-cytoplasmic ratio. chicken fibroblast cell line DF1 was developed from line 0 (EV-0) chick embryo. it is known to be susceptible only to exogenous ALV-J strain SCAU-HN06. we measured growth kinetics after SCAU-HN06 infection. NO produced by the MDM cells infected with SCAU-HN06 increased significantly at each time point. FITC-dextran loaded normal MDM and infected MDM at 24 hpi. phagocytic capacity was examined by flow cytometry at 24 hpi. pi in infected MDM cells were significantly up-regulated compared to controls. however, the transcription of these genes was significantly down-regulated at 36 hpi (ISG12) and 24 and 36 hpi (Mx) respectively. prior immune studies related to ALV have focused on adaptive immunity. macrophages are the most plastic cells in the hematopoietic system. as professional antigen-presenting cells, these cells play an important role in both innate immunity and adaptive immunity. macrophages play key roles in HIV transmission, viral spread in early infection, and can act as a viral reservoir throughout infection. NO is secreted by activated macrophages and plays a critical role in innate and adaptive immune immunity. IL-6 is also a pro-inflammatory cytokine and multifunctional in the innate immune response. IL-6 was sustained at high levels from 3 to 36 hpi. IL-1 production increased at early stages of infection (3 and 12 hpi) we hypothesize that macrophages play an important role in tumorigenesis induced by ALV-J. the type I IFN system is triggered by virus and induces hundreds of ISGs such as Mx and ISG12 activated via JAK-STAT pathway. expression was significantly inhibited at 36 hpi. the result showed that SCAU-HN06 can induce the expression of type I IFN and ISGs. however, SCAU-HN06 can also inhibit ISG expression at late infection stages by unknown mechanisms."}
