{"summary": "a new strand of the literature on multilevel governance has explored these questions in other policy areas. the findings suggest that specialized jurisdictions perform their mandate more faithfully than general-purpose governments. the findings provide public health policy makers a wider frame of reference. the MLHU provides services within the City of London and the County of Middlesex. the city of Hamilton is HPHS's only municipal funder. the provincial contribution to public health spending has varied considerably in recent years. before 1997, the province funded 75% of the mandatory program budgets for most boards of health. before 1997, the province funded 75% of the mandatory program budgets for most boards of health. health units should be governed by autonomous, locally based boards of health. the association of municipalities of Ontario advocated for autonomous health units. the issue of health unit governance has been in the spotlight more recently. public health is a good policy area to further this line of inquiry. comparing the spending growth of autonomous and integrated health units has relevance for both the ongoing debate in Ontario over the structure of public health units. the MLHU and HPHS were selected because their jurisdictions have similar social, demographic and economic characteristics. MLHU and HPHS are the two largest health units, by population. they are similar on measures such as housing affordability, rates of employment, number of food premises and number of nursing homes. this is a possible avenue for future research; however, jurisdictional characteristics of Ontario's 34 other health units differ significantly. the levy covers a portion of mandatory program spending and related cost-shared programs. the municipal contribution to public health spending is known as the municipal levy. the levy covers a portion of mandatory programs and related cost-shared programs. most of the time period covered by this study was supposed to be a time of growth for public health spending. the province increased funding during this period with the hope of increasing the capacity of all public health units, not reducing the amount contributed by municipalities. but any corresponding decreases in municipal funding would offset some of these gains. the county supported the City in its efforts to reduce the municipal levy, but the City took the lead. there was an increase in the municipal levy in 2004 in the immediate aftermath of SARS. the MLHU's annual levy increase barely registers at 0.4%, whereas its cost-shared budget increased by 5% annually. overall operating expenditures for the City of London increased by 4.3% annually, which is only marginally lower. the MLHU kept its municipal levy stable between 2003 and 2014 in order to take advantage of the increase in provincial funding. the city of Hamilton's contribution to public health was increased after SARS (2004), followed by a significant reduction between 2005 and 2007. however, increases in provincial funding allowed for an increase of HPHS's cost-shared program funding. the rest of the period saw increases in the annual levy in the range of 1.3 to 2.8%. the city of Hamilton exerted much greater control over HPHS's levy than the city of London was over the MLHU's levy. in 2014, the municipal levy was actually $8,820,787 and the cost-shared budget was $35,283,148. however, $697,500 of the levy was one-time expenses spent for the consolidation of HPHS office space, not public health programming. the city of Hamilton was able to exert greater control over the cost-shared program funding increases of HPHS. the MLHU seized this opportunity by convincing its municipal funders to maintain their contributions. this stalemate continued until 2012, when the MLHU cut the City's levy by $100,000. the MLHU was one of the lowest per capita funded health units in the province prior to the funding increase. this certainly holds true in a comparison with HPHS. the MLHU spent $44.43 per capita in 2006 and $51.55 in 2011. despite the behavioural change, the MLHU still spends more per capita. the MLHU did behave according to these expectations after the funding increase. it was not able to act with much independence and fared worse in terms of per capita funding than HPHS. this study's findings align with other recent findings from the multilevel governance literature."}
