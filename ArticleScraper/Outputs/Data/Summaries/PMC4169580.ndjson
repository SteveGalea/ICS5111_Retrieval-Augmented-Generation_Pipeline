{"summary": "a total of 254 patients were grouped as atopic and non-atopic according to sensitivity as evaluated by the Prick Test. a total of 254 patients were grouped as atopic and non-atopic according to sensitivity as evaluated by the Prick Test. anti-inflammatory cytokines IL1A 889 (T/T, C, and T) and IL2 330 (G/T and T) and IL4RA +1902 (A and G), IL4 590 (T/C, T/T, C, and T), and IL10 592 (A/A, C/A, A, and C) the prevalence of allergic diseases has experienced an important increase in industrialized countries over recent decades. sensitivity to dust mites is present in 50% of adults and 80% of children. the term \"house dust mite\" has been adopted to describe mite species that can be found in the indoor environment and have the ability to elicit a response resulting in IgE antibodies. interleukins involved in pathogenesis of lupus erythematosus, diabetes, chronic periodontitis, and cancer. little is known about association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in cytokine genes and sensitivity to dust mites. study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Universidade Estadual de Maring\u00e1. participants completed a registration form, were adequately informed about the project, and provided written informed consent prior to their inclusion in the study. dust mite and control extracts were applied at a distance of 2 cm from each other in a predetermined order. a lancet was used to gently prick the extracts onto the skin surface. the size of the wheal or erythema was the classification criterion for the degree of allergic reaction. gene SNP Chromosomal location Diseases IL1A889 rs1800587 2q14 Susceptibility to asthma [62] IL1B+3962 rs1143634 2q14 Chronic periodontitis [63] IL1R1970 rs2234650 2q14 Pulmonary tuberculosis [64] IL1RA 11100 rs315952 2q14.2 Systemic lupus erythemato il4 590 rs2243250 5q31.1 Atopic asthma and allergic rhinitis [57] IL6 174 rs1800795 7p21 Hypertension; type 2 diabetes; systemic-onset juvenile chronic arthritis [77], [78], [79] IL6 nt565 rs1800797 7p21 Coronary artery disease [80] IL10 1082 rs1800896 1q31-q32 Inflammatory and infectious respiratory allele, genotype and haplotype frequencies were determined by direct counting. observed and expected frequencies of patients and controls were compared. risk of developing sensitivity to dust mites was calculated by determining odds ratio. controls were defined according to the approximate number of cases, totaling 116 participants. sample size was calculated using Statdisk version 8.4 [28]. the polymerase chain reaction-sequence specific primer (PCR-SSP) technique was used to genotype allelic variants in cytokine genes using a commercially available genotyping kit. the method consists of a sequence of specific primers capable of amplifying the product (or not) based on the presence (or absence) of SNP in each well.

IL2 at position 330 showed a significant association with three clinical forms of allergic disease (asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis) in the group with 135 families. IL2 at position +166 also showed a significant association (with a p-value of 0.0005) in the same group. a case-control study of 265 patients with persistent allergic rhinitis and 275 healthy controls revealed that the C/T and C/C genotypes in IL4 590 were associated with a significantly decreased risk of mite-sensitized persistent allergic rhinitis. a highly significant association was observed between the frequency of IL4 590 SNP in 98 individuals allergic to D. pteronyssinus and 116 controls and the T/C genotyp tests performed with 108 sensitized children and 432 controls revealed no association between sensitization to dust mite allergens and the six SNPs. findings disagree with our results for the IL4RA SNP (rs1801275), which expressed the A allele as a risk factor (OR, 1.65) and the G allele as a protective factor (OR, 0.61) farinae and IL4 at position 590 for D. pteronyssinus remained significant. these findings may suggest that different causative agents may be regulated by different cytokine production pathways. both cytokines have a biological role in controlling the production of different classes of antibodies."}
