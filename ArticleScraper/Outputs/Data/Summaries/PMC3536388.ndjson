RESULTS Arf1 interacts directly with p27. his-Arf1-FLAG was pulled down more efficiently by the C-terminal half of p27 than by the N-terminal half of p27. the deletions are represented as dotted lines. p27 fused to the C-terminal half of YFP, at the C terminus (p27-cYFP), in the presence of ER-mCherry and of an RNA-silencing suppressor. p27 fused to the C-terminal half of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) at the C terminus (p27-cYFP) and p27 that was fused to the C-terminal half of YFP at the C terminus (p fluorescence was observed using confocal laser scanning microscopy. YFP fluorescence merged well with ER-mCherry fluorescence in the large punctate structures. p27 interacts directly with Arf1 at the p27-induced modified ER membrane. fluorescence was observed via CLSM after 16 h of incubation. in the absence of p27-mCherry, arf1-GFP fluorescence was observed as small punctate structures throughout the cell. however, in the presence of p27-mCherry, the small punctate fluorescence pattern of Arf1-GFP was dramatically reduced. tobacco BY-2 protoplasts were inoculated with ER-GFP alone (A) or ER-GFP and p27-mCherry (B) fluorescence was observed after 16 h of incubation. a TRV vector harboring a partial fragment of NbArf1 (TRV:NbArf1) was expressed via Agrobacterium-mediated expression. an empty TRV vector (TRV:00) was expressed as a control. newly developed leaves were inoculated with RCNMV RNA1 and RNA2 at 7 dpi. rRNA levels were assessed by RT-PCR using primers that allow the amplification of the region of Arf1 that is not present in TRV:NbArf1. equal amounts of total RNA were used for the RT and showed equivalent efficiency of the RT reaction in the samples. the accumulated levels of RCNMV or BMV RNAs from three separate experiments were quantified using the Image Gauge program. the error bars indicate standard deviations. it has been well documented that BFA inhibits the secretion of proteins from the Golgi apparatus back to the ER. tobacco BY-2 protoplasts were transfected with plasmids expressing wild-type Arf1, Arf1-T31N, or Arf1-Q71L together with plasmids expressing RCNMV RNA1 and RNA2. results suggest that the constitutive-active mutant of Arf1 is insufficient to support the replication of RCNMV RNA but that GDP/GTP cycling of Arf1 is required for viral RNA replication. tobacco BY-2 protoplasts were inoculated with plasmids expressing p27-HA and p88-HA in the presence or absence of 10 g/ml BFA. after 16 h of incubation, protoplasts were harvested and disrupted. five percent of the total fraction (lanes 1 to 3) and the eluted fraction (lanes 4 to 6) were subjected to immunoprecipitation using an anti-FLAG antibody. we investigated whether BFA affects the formation of the 480-kDa viral RNA replicase complex. p27-HA and p88-HA were not immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG antibody. p27-HA and p88-HA were not immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG antibody. these results showed that BFA does not prevent the p27-p27/p88 interactions. 27-mCherry, BFA treatment did not affect the distribution patterns of ER-GFP. this was assessed using a fractionation assay. the expression of Arf1-T31N impairs the normal COPI function. it is known that p27-mediated ER modification inhibits the replication of RCNMV RNA. coexpression of p27-mCherry redistributed Sar1-GFP to perinuclear aggregated structures in which these proteins were well colocalized. tobacco BY-2 protoplasts were transfected with plasmids expressing wild-type Sar1 or Sar1-H74L together with pUBRC1 and pUBRC2. fluorescence was visualized by confocal microscopy. the merging of green and red fluorescence is shown in yellow. we performed double immunofluorescence staining of RCNMV-infected tobacco BY-2 protoplasts. immunofluorescence using antibodies that recognize p27 (green) and incorporated BrUTP (red) we reevaluated the data obtained by LC-MS/MS analyses of the affinity-purified RdRP membrane fraction (29) and found that Arf1 was present in the fraction that coimmunoprecipitated with FLAG-tagged p27. gi|1703374 ADP ribosylation factor 1 gi|10798648 Putative DnaJ protein gi|120661 Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase A gi|120665 Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase B Fig 1. p27 fused to the C-terminal half of YFP, at the C terminus (p27-cYFP), was expressed together with Arf1 fused to the other half of YFP, at the C terminus (p27-cYFP), via agroinfiltration. fluorescence of the reconstructed YFP and ER-mCherry in all agroinfiltrated leaves was visualized using confocal microscopy 3 days after p27-cYFP fluorescence merged well with ER-mCherry fluorescence in large punctate structures. p27 interacts directly with Arf1 at the p27-induced modified ER membrane. p27 recruited Arf1 from the Golgi apparatus to the ER membrane. in the presence of p27-mCherry, the small punctate fluorescence pattern of Arf1-GFP was dramatically reduced. p27-mCherry and p88-mCherry efficiently supported the replication of RNA2. p27-mCherry and p88-mCherry colocalized with the ER marker protein. fluorescence was visualized by confocal microscopy. tobacco BY-2 protoplasts were inoculated with ER-GFP alone (A) or ER-GFP and p27-mCherry (B) fluorescence was observed at 16 h postinoculation. new leaves were inoculated with RCNMV RNA1 and RNA2 at 7 dpi. two days after inoculation, three inoculated leaves from three different plants were harvested and mixed. total RNA was extracted from the mixture of three independent inoculated leaves. tobacco BY-2 protoplasts were inoculated with in vitro transcribed RNA1 and RNA2. the inoculated protoplasts were incubated at 17\u00b0C for 16 h. the inoculated protoplasts were incubated at 17\u00b0C for 16 h. tobacco BY-2 protoplasts were inoculated with RCNMV RNA1 and RNA2 and incubated for 16 h in the presence or absence of BFA. the accumulation of viral RNAs was reduced 5- to 10-fold in the presence of BFA. a negligible effect of BFA on RCNMV RNA replication was not due to its nonspecific toxicity. ids expressing RCNMV RNA1 and RNA2 showed that the expression of Arf1 reduced the accumulation of viral RNAs by about 25%. the expression of Arf1-T31N or Arf1-Q71L reduced the accumulation of viral RNAs by more than 80%. these results suggest that the constitutive-active mutant of Arf1 is insufficient to support the replication of RCNMV RNA. tobacco BY-2 protoplasts were inoculated with R1-Luc-R1 and cap-Luc-pA60 in the presence of 10 g/ml BFA. the luciferase activities of R1-Luc-R1 and cap-Luc-pA60 in the absence of inhibitor were defined as 100%. 480-kDa replicase complex requires p27-p27/p88 interactions. accumulation of p27-HA and p88-HA was significantly decreased by BFA treatment. p27-HA and p88-HA were not affected by BFA. we investigated whether arf1 function is required to keep the ER membrane association of p27. for this, p27-mCherry colocalized with ER-GFP in p27-induced large aggregate structures in the DMSO control. in the absence of p27-mCherry, BFA treatment did not affect the distribution patterns of p27-HA or p88-HA. a dominant negative mutant of Sar1 (Sar1-H74L) exerts a known dominant negative effect on COPII vesicle transport. the mutant was shown previously to trap vesicles in a coated configuration so that they are unable to fuse with the target membrane. the expression of Sar1-H74L did not significantly affect the accumulation of viral RNAs. 27-mCherry redistributed Sar1-GFP to perinuclear aggregated structures in which these proteins were well colocalized. tobacco BY-2 protoplasts were transfected with plasmids expressing either wild-type Sar1 or Sar1-H74L together with pUBRC1 and pUBRC2. BY-2 protoplasts were inoculated with RNA1 and RNA2 after 14 h of incubation. protoplasts were incubated with actinomycin D for 1 h to block host DNA-dependent RNA polymerases. membrane-bound p27 recruits Arf1 to the viral replication sites. membrane-bound Arf1 can recruit a diverse array of effectors, including COPI, clathrin, cytoskeletal regulators. plant arf1 effector proteins may contribute to the establishment of VRCs of RCNMV via a mechanism similar to that reported in vertebrate viruses (23). Interestingly, treatment of RCNMV-infected BY-2 protoplasts with 1-butanol inhibited the accumulation of viral RNAs. the p27-induced remodeling of the early secretory pathway is reminiscent of the membrane remodeling caused by potato virus X (PVX) and turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) infection (84, 85) p27-induced membrane remodeling relied on the functional secretory pathway because BFA treatment disrupted this membrane remodeling. plant RNA viruses, TuMV, melon necrotic spot virus and BMV were insensitive to BFA during RNA replication. grapevine fanleaf virus (90) and RCNMV (Fig. 3) were sensitive to BFA during RNA replication. VRC and subsequent cell-to-cell movement of RCNMV required for effective viral spread."}
