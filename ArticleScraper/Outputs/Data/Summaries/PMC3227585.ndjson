{"summary": "bovine genome sequence and first-generation HapMap projects have directly enabled genome-assisted selective breeding [1], nascent investigations of non-traditional traits such as marker-assisted vaccination. the development of new class of anti-infectives known as innate immunologicals [4], and the elucidation of loci that have evolved under strong selection. alian TLR genes are expressed by antigen-presenting cells (i.e., macrophages or dendritic cells) most of the TLR ligand specificities have been experimentally elucidated. six gene family members (TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, TLR6, TLR9) known to recognize microbial (bacteria, fungi, protozoa) and/or synthetic ligands. five (TLR3, TLR4, T 276 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 4 insertion-deletion (indel) mutations were detected and validated. results of this study will enable bovine translational genomics, QTL refinement, and ultimately, genome-assisted methods for animal selection. in total, 474 variable sites were predicted from intragenic analyses. 212 previously validated SNPs [30], 4 known insertion-deletion mutations (indels) [30] and 258 new putative SNPs were predicted. 62% of 258 new putative SNPs were located either within or immediately flanking homopolymer repeats. the true minor alleles (0.5) were correctly identified for 236/244 (97%) SNPs via pyrosequencing. the true minor alleles (0.5) were correctly identified for 236/244 (97%) SNPs via pyrosequencing. 266 SNPs and 4 indels were successfully incorporated into 243 unique haplotypes via Bayesian reconstructions [30], [31]. one discrete haplotype carrying the putative TLR5 nonsense SNP could not be incorporated into discrete haplotypes with best-pair phase probability0.90. 96 animals were genotyped for TLR3, TLR7, and TLR8. for all other loci, 549 animals were genotyped. average intragenic linkage disequilibrium (r2) values. a comparison of average intragenic r2 values calculated between adjacent variable sites across all 10 genes revealed a dynamic range of LD (0.09-0.70; all cattle, 31 breeds; Table 2). Discrete regions of high and low LD were also detected using the general model for varying recombination rate [31], [34], [35]. the highest median estimate of recombination rate was observed in TLR3. analysis restricted to the B. t. taurus breeds showed that only 118 tagSNPs and 1 tagIndel were predicted to capture 100% of the variation at 235 variable sites. the cumulative tagging efficiency (total tags predicted/total number of validated variable sites) was similar for both analyses. the 250 Kyr divergence between B. t. taurus and B. t. indicus was evident in most, but not all, haplotype networks. the high frequency network nodes demonstrating subspecific haplotype sharing often included at least two indicine sires. this correlation was driven by the large number of haplotypes predicted to be shared among the beef and dairy breeds. median joining (MJ) haplotype networks for bovine TLR3 using haplotypes predicted for all cattle (n = 96 AI sires, 31 breeds) node sizes are proportional to haplotype frequency, and all branch lengths are drawn to scale. node sizes are proportional to haplotype frequency. only nodes representing10 cattle are labeled (A-F), which collectively represents>93% of the cattle meeting the phase requirements.

Alphabetized letters at nodes represent the breed distribution of each haplotype. node sizes are proportional to haplotype frequency, and all branch lengths are drawn to scale. the MAF for the TLR5 putative nonsense SNP, as estimated from 405 Holsteins in three herds was 0.068 (Table 3). polymorphisms involving AA substitutions, PolyPhen and SIFT produced analogous predictions for 61/72 (85%) observed replacements.

TLR1, TLR6, and TLR10 were considered a single locus for multiple test correction. Discussion Our methodological workflows resulted in the robust identification of SNPs with precise estimates of MAF for the bovine TLR genes. large numbers of tightly clustered SNPs are sometimes difficult to genotype. we successfully validated several SNPs for which assays had previously failed. some regions of TLR1 posed the greatest technical challenge due to sequence similarity with TLR6. significantly positive values for Tajima's D were detected for genomic regions encoding TLR3 and TLR8 (Table 4) despite correction for multiple testing, and for TLR3, the addition of best haplotype pairs for sires with phase probabilities0.90 produced very similar test statistics (D) the region of TLR3 demonstrating the strongest deviation from neutrality does not include the two nonsynonymous SNPs predicted to impact protein function. however, 40 validated SNPs were found to flank the putative promoter. the effects of bottlenecks are expected to be uniform and potentially dramatic for proximal, evolutionarily related X-linked loci (TLR7, TLR8) performing similar functions (6, 11-12), especially given smaller effective population size (chromosomal) and female limited recombination. a regression based test also provided no evidence for the effects of a population bottleneck or selection operating on variation within TLR7. plotypes falling into nodes D, E, and F by eight nonsynonymous SNPs encoding AA substitutions. the four most common haplotypes (nodes A, B, D, and E) differed only by one synonymous SNP (nodes A vs B; encoding S10S) and one putatively benign or tolerated nonsynonymous SNP (nodes D vs E; encoding S49 the new Illumina BovineHD assay may not be sufficient to detect all disease associations with TLR loci. additional association and functional studies are needed to clarify the involvement of TLR2, TLR6 and TLR10 with respect to differential susceptibility to MAP infection in Holstein cattle. evolution under repeated exposure to many of these diseases may provide some explanation for the observed patterns of variation detected within TLR3 and TLR8. however, it is also possible that more ancient host-pathogen interactions may have contributed to the signatures of selection detected in this study. future studies are needed to help elucidate whether selective signals in TLR3 and TLR8 extend beyond modern domestic cattle lineages. the results of our single marker association tests indirectly support the biological concept of functional unity with respect to bovine TLR2, TLR6 and TLR10. variation at all three loci categorically linked to a common microbial phenotype (bacterial culture status for MAP) in Holstein cattle. dsRNA; Reoviridae), foot and mouth disease (ssRNA; Picornaviridae), bovine viral diarrhea (ssRNA; Flaviviridae), calf coronavirus (ssRNA; neonatal diarrhea; Coronaviridae) and bovine parainfluenza 3 (ssRNA; Paramyxoviridae) may have contributed to the signatures of selection detected in this study. the results of our single marker association tests indirectly support the biological concept of functional unity with respect to bovine TLR2, TLR6 and TLR10. AA substitutions in human TLR1 and TLR10 were demonstrated to negatively impact receptor function [58]-[59], with TLR10 ligand recognition similar to the known range of ligands established for TLR1 [58]. bovine subspecies were assigned based on phenotype and breed origin. for this study, we synthesized gene-specific amplification primers with a unique 10 bp 5\u2032 barcode (Roche MIDs) for each of the 10 bovine TLR genes. each pool consisting of 32 elite sire DNAs mixed at equal concentrations. all amplicons were purified using the Qiaquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) as previously described [24], [25], and the concentrations were estimated by Nanodrop. for preparation of a Roche 454 Titanium fragment library, we standardized all barcoded amplicons to 10 ng/l and devised a normalization procedure that accounted for differences in amplicon size. putative SNPs were filtered using a method devised from a priori knowledge of biallelic controls (212 SNPs + 4 indels) [30] that were purposely seeded into the amplicon library. we considered the possibility that some SNPs may only be found as one allele in a single elite sire. genotyping was performed using the KASPar allele-specific fluorescent genotyping system (Kbiosciences, Hertfordshire UK), as previously described [29], [30]. thermal cycling parameters and reaction concentrations followed manufacturer's recommendations, with some modifications to MgCl2 concentrations. haplotypes (TLR7, TLR8) were directly ascertained by genotype homozygosity in our sire panel used for SNP discovery. estimates of recombination across each gene were also assessed in PHASE 2.1 using the general model for varying recombination rate [31], [34] by a factor2.5 between adjacent sites was considered evidence for historical recombination. MJ networks were constructed using Network 4.5.1.0 (Fluxus Technology Ltd, Suffolk, England), and the default character weights of 10 for SNPs and 20 for indels. results were visualized, annotated, and adjusted within Network Publisher (Fluxus Technology Ltd, Suffolk, England) results were visualized, annotated, and adjusted to ensure proper network magnification and clarity without changing branch lengths. a case-control study was performed to estimate the association between specific TLR genotypes and MAP infection in Holstein cattle. the study population was derived from an established repository [69] that included whole blood samples preserved from adult Holstein cattle in three herds. for validated SNPs and indels in the 5\u2032 upstream regions, introns, and those associated with nonsynonymous or putative nonsense mutations were evaluated for further analysis. for these 73 variable sites, we excluded SNPs and indels with MAFs0.01 in our infected cases, leaving 32 SNPs and 3 indels for association tests. potential confounding by age was examined by including birth year as a fixed covariate. for models where evidence of confounding by age was detected, birth year was retained in the model to adjust genotype estimates for this effect. with exception of TLR1, TLR6, and TLR10, all single marker P-values were corrected for multiple testing by applying the FDR correction. bovine subspecies were assigned based on phenotype and breed origin. for this study, we synthesized gene-specific amplification primers with a unique 10 bp 5\u2032 barcode (Roche MIDs) for each of the 10 bovine TLR genes. three bovine DNA pools were used to amplify all TLR targets via barcoded primers. targets that were intolerant to the addition of 5\u2032 oligonucleotide barcodes for PCR amplification were amplified using standard primers. amplicons were purified using the Qiaquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) the direction of adjustment (plus or minus) was determined by the direction of the deviation (i.e., smaller = proportionally less template; larger = proportionally more template; Table S1). amplicons smaller than the mean by0.5 SDs must be proportionally reduced in the final library. the opposite is true for larger amplicons. 96 DNAs from the pyrosequencing discovery panel were also used for allele-specific genotyping. 96 DNAs from the pyrosequencing discovery panel were also used for allele-specific genotyping. haplotype reconstruction and missing data imputation (0.58%) was performed with PHASE 2.1 [31], [64], [65] using all validated intragenic polymorphisms, all cattle for a given locus, and the \u2013X10 option. predicted haplotype phases with best pair probabilities0.90 were retained for further analysis. a minimal set of tagSNPs/Indels predicted to capture 100% of the variation (r2>0.80) segregating in B. t. taurus and all cattle combined was deduced using the Tagger algorithm implemented in Haploview. MJ networks were constructed using Network 4.5.1.0 (Fluxus Technology Ltd, Suffolk, England), and the default character weights of 10 for SNPs and 20 for indels. LR gene family performed a goodness of fit test assuming equal probabilities for benign or tolerated AA phenotypes versus those predicted to impact protein function. a case-control study was performed to estimate the association between specific TLR genotypes and MAP infection in Holstein cattle. genetypes for validated SNPs and indels in the 5\u2032 upstream regions, introns, and those associated with nonsynonymous or putative nonsense mutations in bovine TLR genes recognizing bacterial ligands (TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, TLR6, TLR9, TLR10) were evaluated for further analysis. ELISA values for MAP-specific antibody were selected as cases (n = 68) odds of infection associated with each additional copy of the minor allele were modeled as a single continuous covariate. each genotype was modeled as an indicator variable and effect estimates were generated for cattle homozygous and homozygous for the major allele. potential confounding by age was examined by including birth year as a fixed covariate. MAP tested the hypothesis that haplotypes differ among cases and controls for all genes evaluated in the single marker association analysis. for maximum LD-based resolution of haplotypes, we used all variable markers within seven bovine TLR genes that recognize bacterial ligands. table S3 TagSNPs and Indels (XLSX) Click here for additional data file.
