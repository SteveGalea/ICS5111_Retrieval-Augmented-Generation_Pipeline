(%) Winter and summer seasons merged, giving an extended period of influenza activities. closed circles indicate data based on nurses\u2019 plans to get vaccinated the next year. overall, self-protection was the main reason for receiving seasonal influenza vaccination. lack of a work requirement for vaccination was not a main reason for not getting vaccinated because vaccination is not mandatory in Hong Kong. a new monovalent vaccine against A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was introduced at the same year end. the new vaccine was accepted by only 14.2% of the nurses. the association of A(H1N1)pdm2009 vaccine with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome was a deterrent to vaccination. measures for improving vaccination coverage should be tailored to the needs of subcategories of health care workers, including nurses."}
