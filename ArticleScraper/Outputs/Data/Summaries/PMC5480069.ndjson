{"summary": "METHODS A cross-sectional survey among the GCC countries' residents. data collected electronically through a smartphone app. RESULTS A total of 1812 respondents participated in the study. influenza, pneumococcal, pertussis and meningococcal diseases are a major threat to humans. influenza causes a million deaths worldwide[5,6], and pneumonia, mostly caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, is responsible for 1.6 million deaths globally[7]. the incidence of meningococcal disease ranges from one per 100000 population in developed world settings to 1000 per 100000 population in the developing countries of the \"meningitis belt\" studies conducted to assess influenza vaccine uptake among health care workers in GCC countries reveal that the decision to receive the vaccine is influenced by an individual\u2019s type of work, gender, vaccine awareness, need to protect those around and previous vaccination encounters. lack of awareness, uncertainty of the effectiveness of the vaccine, and fear of adverse effects are the most common barriers to the implementation of the vaccine. abbas et al[39] 2004-2005 Saudi Arabia Workers of two major industries: a food processing and a chemical plant 2400 (20-60) Influenza 62.4 (562/900) food processing industry and 55.6 (834/1500) chemical industry Al-Tawfiq et al[38] 2007 Saudi Arabia HCWs at Saudi Aramco Medical Services Organization 244 NR Influenza 51 in the preceding year and 71.5 in the last 5 years. hammari et al[21] 2012-2013 Saudi Arabia HCWs at 6 major hospitals 242 NR Influenza 38.8 (94/242) Alhammadi et al[66] 2012-2013 Qatar HCWs at a tertiary teaching institution in doha 223 NR Influenza 68.3 (152/223) alhammadi et al[22] 2013 Qatar HCWs at a paediatric unit at Hamad Medical Corporation in doha a minimum sample size of 480 was considered sufficient for this survey. the data collected were analysed statistically using SPSS v.23.0 (SPSS), Chicago, IL, United States. approach was successfully tested in a few studies[32-34] and was found to be reliable and capable of collecting valid and credible data. the app gives each user a unique device identifier to prevent redundancy of data or rather the submission of several forms by the same user. a minimum sample size of 480 was considered sufficient for this survey. RESULTS Demographics Out of 2741 individuals who downloaded the application, 1812 (66%) completed the survey. their mean age was 27.3 years (SD 8.3), 82% (1485/1812) were male and 24% (436/1812) reported having 1 chronic diseases. over half of participants were smokers and 56% had up to high school level of education. high school certificate 1009 (56) 172 (17) 204 (20) 163 (16) 191 (19)

respondents reported receiving meningococcal vaccine. the remaining 80% (1449/1812) denied receiving it. vaccination uptake varied greatly across the countries ranging from 3% (2/60) among Omani

aware of the vaccine was the main reason for non-receipt of the vaccine. medium smokers (defined as smoking between 11-20 cigarettes per day) (aOR = 2.2, 95%CI: 1.6-3.1, P 0.04) were more likely to be vaccinated compared to not smokers. those who had malignancy (aOR = 3.1, 95%CI: 1.3-7.2, P = 0.01) and those who suffered from immunosuppressive conditions (aOR = 5.1, 95%CI: 2.0-13.0, P 0.01) were

significantly increased the likelihood of receiving meningococcal vaccine. a similar requirement exists in other workplace settings leading to increased vaccination rate. however, the uptake of influenza vaccine in this study was lower than what was found among adults aged 19 years resident in the united states (43.2%)[40], France (26.4%), Germany (28.2%), and the united kingdom (28.7%) in recent years[41]. compared to other vaccines, the uptake rate of influenza vaccine varied only minimally ranging from 15% to 24%. this is consistent with recent campaigns in the GCC countries which mostly focus on improving the uptake among \u201cat risk\u201d group. study found that the coverage rate of meningococcal vaccine was generally low. but was relatively higher among \u201cat risk\u201d individuals compared to those who were \u201cnot at risk\u201d. for the pertussis vaccine, the coverage rates in GCC countries varied very widely, from 7% in Saudi Arabia to 75% in Oman. ating the clients for vaccination should be the physician\u2019s priority. this is the first study measuring the uptake rate of seasonal influenza, pneumococcal, meningococcal and pertussis vaccines among members of public in the GCC countries. the uptake rates according to our study were low compared to that in developed countries. this highlights the need for further research and implementation of tailored programmes for increasing awareness about vaccine-preventable diseases among adults in GCC countries. \"not at risk\" group: Individuals who are 65 years and/or have chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, and bronchial asthma. \"not at risk\" group: Individuals who are 65 years and do not have pre-existing medical conditions that predisposes them to certain infections. individuals who do not have \"at risk\" conditions listed above do not have pre-existing medical conditions that predispose them to certain infections."}
