{"summary": "networks can be used for deriving predictive signatures of disease progression or severity, as well as helping to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. single data-type signatures and biomarkers have found mixed success where many potentially useful biomarkers have not been validated. the integration of the transcriptome and proteome is a current challenge in omics research due to differences in dynamic range of measurements, incomplete annotation, isoform differences, and temporal effects. we have developed the methods needed to explore whether a relationship exists between co-expression network models built from transcriptomic and proteomic data types. signature consisted of a bipartite module graph, connecting co-expression modules obtained from transcriptomic and proteomic data. the signature consisted of significant module member overlap, correlation of eigenvector summaries, and common phenotypic associations with outcomes of interest. the functional enrichment of module sub-graphs was overlapping across data types, further offering evidence of the underlying biological network structure. the control mouse at Day 7, replicate 2, and infected mouse (PFU 102), Day 4, replicate 3, were removed from the study since in the transcript data, the mice clustered with the incorrect infection label. the difference in pathology among the viral dosages is relatively small. peptides were filtered by missingness, taking peptides with not more than 20% missing data, resulting in a matrix of 90 samples by 2273 peptides. matched microarray data were processed using the Agilent Preprocess Bioconductor package (Lopez-romero, 2010) the intersection between quality filtered peptide and transcript data corresponded to 90 total samples with 2205 peptides mapping to 445 Uniprot IDs and 490 Entrez gene IDs. between the two data sets, 437 Entrez IDs are shared. some discrepancies were observed, since peptides are often degenerate. j in adjacency matrix [a] and ki are the summation of row i in adjacency matrix [a] and ki (the connectivity) were partitioned into subnetworks or modules. modules were labeled numerically according to decreasing size. correlation between eigenvectors was measured using the Pearson correlation. edges were kept if the eigenvector-phenotype association was in the same direction and adjusted p-values were less than 0.05. transcript and proteomic expression profiles were collected for 92 mice. the control mouse at Day 7, replicate 2, and infected mouse (PFU 102), Day 4, replicate 3, were removed from the study since in the transcript data, the mice clustered with the incorrect infection label. peptides are matched to an Accurate Mass and Time (AMT) tag database. abundance measurements for 16,890 peptides mapping to 3277 proteins were recorded for 184 LC-MS runs. from the total set of proteins, 691 proteins had this score or better. 1,416 probes passed probe QC flags for all replicates of at least one infected time point. transcript probes on the gene microarray were mapped to entrez gene IDs using annotation databases. networks were constructed using intersection between quality filtered peptide and transcript data. between the two data sets, 437 Entrez IDs are shared. peptide networks had an R2 greater than 0.8 and transcript networks greater than 0.9. the adjacency matrix is used to compute topological overlap between nodes, weighting the network edges. ten thousand permutations were performed to build the bipartite module graph. the first step involved measuring the member overlap between all pairs of modules. the count of permuted overlaps larger than the observed was used as an empirical p-value. the nave approach was designed for comparison to the module level analysis. the approach involved computing correlations on the overall pathology score phenotype. the nave top ranked entities were compared to the rankings within modules. transcript module 1 and peptide module 4 showed the same pattern of associations with phenotype as transcript module 3 and peptide module 2. the previous two modules showed strong associations with denudation, debris, and airway pathology. transcript module 4 and peptide module 2 overlapped with peptide module 12. the correlation between transcript module 1 and peptide modules 4 and 8 was 0.523 and 0.434 respectfully (p-values 1.16e-07 and 1.908e-05). the correlation between transcript module 4 and peptide modules 12 and 13 was 0.696 and 0.683 (p-values 1.159e-13 and 2.554e-14 for both). peptide modules 4 and 8 shared negative correlations with the overall pathology. the rich set of phenotypes was used to prioritize the bipartite sub-graphs. for each phenotype, the maximum and minimum correlating modules from each data type are found. overlapping eigenvector summaries show similar response patterns across transcript and peptide modules. blue lines show collapsed transcript module eigenvectors plotted over days post infection. top row shows sub-network of transcript module 3 and peptide module 2. peptide module 4 and peptide module 2 included members of the aldehyde dehydrogenase family. transcript module 4 contained members of the aldehyde dehydrogenase family. these proteins are associated with metal binding proteins, interactions with DNA and engaging in changes to acetylation patterns. transcript module 1 and peptide module 4 and 8 have a number of overlapping GO terms. most significant overlapping GO terms include processes involving actin filament processes. transcript module 1 and peptide module 4 and 8 have a number of overlapping GO terms. transcript module is not highly significant when considering Bonferroni adjusted p-values. GO term overlap between modules is strong here. endopeptidases, hydrolases, and cytokines have important roles in SARS-CoV infection. ave top ranked peptides and transcripts were not necessarily the most central within a given module. the next two top ranked module transcripts were not in the nave top 10. the top ranked peptide was ranked 10th in the nave list. eight of ten of the most significant GO terms were also found in the bipartite module graph results. the most significant results were found in peptide module 7 (not part of the module-graph) transcript module 4 and peptide module 12 and 13 were functionally compared. transcript module 3 and peptide module 2 showed the strongest correlations. transcript module 3 and peptide module 2 showed the strongest correlations. transcript module 3 and peptide module 2 showed the strongest correlations. transcript module 3 and peptide module 2 were more associated with the administered viral dosage instead of day of infection. the previous two modules showed strong associations with denudation, debris, and airway pathology. overlaps were represented as a count of similar Entrez gene IDs. the correlation between transcript module 1 and peptide modules 4 and 8 was 0.523 and 0.434 respectfully (p-values 1.16e-07 and 1.908e-05). the correlation between transcript module 4 and peptide modules 12 and 13 was 0.696 and 0.683 (p-values 1.159e-13 and 2.554e-14 for both). the correlation between transcript module 4 and peptide modules 12 and 13 was 0.755 and 0.801 (p-value 2.2e-16 for both the rich set of phenotypes was used to prioritize the bipartite sub-graphs. initialize an n by m matrix where n is the number of transcript modules and m is the number of peptide modules. for each phenotype, the maximum and minimum correlating modules from each data type are found. overlapping eigenvector summaries show similar response patterns across transcript and peptide modules. blue lines show collapsed peptide module eigenvectors plotted over days post infection. middle row shows transcript module 4 and peptide module 2 with peptide modules 12 and 13. transcript module 4 and peptide module 4 contained members of the aldehyde dehydrogenase family. these proteins are associated with metal binding proteins, interactions with DNA and engaging in changes to acetylation patterns. transcript module 4 and peptide module 4 were enzyme-driven and were associated with serpin family members. transcript module 1 and peptide module 4 and 8 have a number of overlapping GO terms. most significant overlapping GO terms include processes involving actin filament processes. transcript module 1 and peptide module 4 and 8 have a number of overlapping GO terms. transcript module is not highly significant when considering Bonferroni adjusted p-values.
