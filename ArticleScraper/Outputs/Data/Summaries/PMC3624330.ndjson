{"summary": "1918 pandemic was one of the most deadly contagious calamities in human history. approximately 30% of the world's population (500 million people) may have been clinically infected (1). over 2.5% mortality rates among infected people compared with less than 0.1% in annual influenza epidemics (1\u20133) the 1918 virus HA gene was the only gene which conferred the property of high growth rate in mouse lungs to the contemporary human H1N1 virus. however, the lung titer of a virus possessing the 1918 virus PB1 gene was 3 log units lower than that of a virus possessing the 1918 virus HA gene (11) it was still unclear whether a high replication ability or the 1918 virus HA gene is required for 1918 virus to exhibit high virulence in mice. all experiments with live viruses and with transfectants generated by reverse genetics were performed in a biosafety level 3 containment laboratory approved for such use by the CDC and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. mice were intranasally inoculated with 10-fold serial dilutions (three mice per dilution) of viruses. excised tissues of the lungs were preserved in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin. Tissues were then processed for paraffin embedding and cut into 5-m-thick sections. one section was stained with routine hematoxylin and eosin. the other was processed for immunohistological staining by using a rabbit anti-H1N1 influenza virus polyclonal antibody. a single biological replicate infected with 1918PB1/K173 virus at day 3 p.i. was confirmed to be uninfected. the sample was discarded from the data set prior to analysis. IPA software examines RNA expression data in the context of known biological functions and pathways. pathway analysis diagrams show the biological associations between genes, represented as nodes, and the edges that define the biological relationship between two nodes, represented as a line. solid lines depict direct interactions, and dashed lines depict indirect interactions. an arrow pointing back to the same node signifies regulation, and an arrow pointing back to the same node signifies self-regulation. all experiments with live viruses and with transfectants generated by reverse genetics were performed in a biosafety level 3 containment laboratory approved for such use by the CDC and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. mice were intranasally inoculated with 10-fold serial dilutions (three mice per dilution) of viruses. lungs were preserved in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin and cut into 5-m-thick sections. one section was stained with routine hematoxylin and eosin. the other was stained for immunohistological staining. microarray raw data were extracted using the R bioconductor Limma package (19) and median normalized. differentially expressed genes were identified using the fold-change-based concomitant evaluation of distinctness and similarity (CDS) statistical test (21) with a fold-change parameter of 1.2 and a P value cutoff of 0.01. s show the biological associations between genes, represented as nodes, and the edges that define the biological relationship between two nodes, represented as a line. solid lines depict direct interactions, and dashed lines depict indirect interactions. all edges are supported by at least one published reference or from canonical information stored in the IPKB. 106 PFU/g, approximately 100-fold higher than those in mice infected with K173 virus (P 0.05), suggesting that the PB1 and HA genes appear to support efficient replication of the 1918 virus in mouse lungs. three mice from each group were euthanized for virus titration. the resultant viral titer was about 10-fold higher than the 1918PB1/K173 and 1918HA/K173 viral titers. there was no statistical difference between the virus titers of 1918PB1/K173 and 1918HA/K173 and those of 1918(3P+NP)/K173 and those of 1918(3P+NP)/K173. this suggests a prominent role for the 1918 polymerase complex in efficient virus growth in mice. the 1918 and 1918HA/K173 viruses replicated well throughout the infection. the mean titers of both viruses were more than 107 PFU/g. the replication of K173 virus was limited in mouse lungs. pathogenicity of reassortant viruses between 1918 and K173 viruses in mice. mice infected with 106 PFU showed severe weight loss and succumbed to infection as early as 4 days p.i. the body weights of mice infected with 106 PFU decreased rapidly, and all of the infected mice died by day 7 p.i. pathological examination of lungs of mice infected with the reassortant viruses at day 5 postinfection. results show that 1918 virus HA is the primary determinant of enhanced pathogenicity in the 1918 virus infection. the left and middle panels show lung sections with H&E staining. the right panels show immunostaining with a rabbit anti-H1N1 influenza virus polyclonal antibody (anti-A/WSN/33) that was previously (9). global severe inflammatory reactions were prominent in the lungs of mice infected with those viruses. RNA polymerase and NP of 1918 virus may contribute to aberrant host responses observed with 1918 virus infection in mice. a total of 2,289 DE genes and 6,197 DE genes (CDS FC 1.2; P 0.01) distinguished the highly pathogenic viruses from low-pathogenicity viruses (i.e., K173, 1918PB1/K173, and 1918(3P+NP)/K173; low-pathogenicity virus group) SVD-MDS representation of the samples on correspondence space with the gene signature applied (6,197 DE genes differentiating low-pathogenicity and high-pathogenicity virus groups from mock infection in at least one group) each data point represents the RNA expression profile of a single mouse. us signaling 6.31E16 52/120 Communication between innate and adaptive immune cells 1.26E14 45/109 Role of pattern recognition receptors in recognition of bacteria and viruses 2.00E14 46/106 Altered T cell and B cell signaling in rheumatoid arthritis 2.51E14 43/92 1918HA/K173 vs mock infection (4,911 DE genes) Molecular ratioc Low-pathogenicity-virus vs high-pathogenicity-virus vs mock infection (6,197 DE genes) Role of macrophages, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells in rheumatoid arthritis 2.00E3 104/332 Caveolar-mediated endocytosis signaling 2.95E3 34/85 Acute phase response signaling 3.47E3 63/178 1918 virus vs mock infection (9,247 signaling 3.98E7 45/120 Communication between innate and adaptive immune cells 4.90E6 39/109 Hepatic fibrosis/hepatic stellate cell activation 1.02E5 50/146 1918PB1/K173 vs mock infection (2,911 DE genes) Role of pattern recognition receptors in recognition of bacteria and viruses 6.03E9 34/106 Communication between innate and adaptive immune cells 7.41E8 31/109 LXR/RXR activation 1.41 i-Hochberg (B-H) multiple testing correction for the P value was applied to rank the significance associated for each pathway. examination of 6,197 DE genes that distinguish the high-pathogenicity virus group from the low-pathogenicity virus group compared with mock infection during the late infection stage. there was an apparent divergence of high-pathogenicity and low-pathogenicity virus groups, with greater within-group similarity observed. K173 recombinant virus expressing 1918 virus HA alone induces a pronounced transcriptional response similar to that induced by 1918 virus in mice. functional analysis of genes from 1918HA/K173-infected mouse lung revealed significant enrichment of genes associated with the protein ubiquitination pathway. a total of 283 genes distinguished 1918 virus from 1918HA/K173 virus. 1918 and 1918HA/K173 viruses differentially regulate lymphocyte gene expression in lungs of the virus-infected mice. average lung gene expression for 1918 virus relative to 1918HA/K173 virus is overl. 1918 virus-induced gene expression is higher than that induced by the 1918HA/K173 reference. green indicates that 1918 virus-induced gene expression is lower than that induced by the 1918HA/K173 reference. member F NM_175449 50.71 21.00 FANCA Fanconi anemia, complementation group A NM_016925 2.85 1.95 FCGR3A Fc fragment of IgG, low affinity IIIa, receptor (CD16a) NM_144559 22.18 14.04 GCG Glucagon NM_008100 3.90 1.60 GPRC5A G protein-coupled receptor, family C, member A NM_181444 1.09 1.34 KLRK1 Killer cell lectin-like receptor subfamily K, member 1 NM_033078 14.02 7.44 LAG3 Lymphocyte activation gene 3 NM_008479 6.94 4.47 LCP2 Lymphocyte cytosolic protein 2 (SH2 domain containing leukocyte protein of 76 kDa) NM_010696 3.91 2.66 MX1 Myxovirus (influenza virus) resistance 1, interferon-inducible protein BD Ubiquitin D NM_023137 26.22 12.30 XCL1 Chemokine (C motif) ligand 1 NM_008510 17.45 7.44 a Differentially expressed genes (FC 1.2) between 1918 and 1918HA/K173 viruses. the highly pathogenic viruses induced the transcriptional activity of proinflammatory genes during the acute phase.

K173(3P+NP)/1918 virus may be attenuated due to incompatibility between 1918 and K173 viral proteins. reassortant viruses containing the 1918 virus NA or NS gene replicated less efficiently than did the K173 virus in mice. mice were intranasally infected with 106 PFU of each reassortant, 1918 virus, or K173 virus. titers were determined in MDCK cells. bars show the mean titers in lungs of the infected mice for the respective virus. 106 PFU of 1918HA/K173 virus did not kill mice even at the highest dose tested, 8.4 107 PFU/mouse. inoculation with 106 PFU of this virus did not lead to appreciable changes in body weight. despite its poor replication in mouse lungs, the 1918 virus HA gene contributes to both efficient replication and high virulence in mice. Lungs from the mice infected with 1918, 1918HA/K173 and 1918(3P+NP)/K173 viruses had viral antigen commonly found in bronchial lumina and alveoli. virus caused severe lung infection similar to that seen with 1918 virus infection. this results indicate that 1918 virus HA is the primary determinant of enhanced pathogenicity in the 1918 virus infection. mice infected with 1918, 1918HA/K173, and 1918(3P+NP)/K173 viruses had viral antigen commonly found in bronchial lumina and alveoli. global analysis of host responses in the lungs of mice infected with wild-type and reassortant viruses. gene sets that distinguished 1918, 1918HA/K173, and 1918(3P+NP)/K173 viruses from mock infection at the early time point. a large proportion of the genes were associated with the canonical pathways known as \u201ccommunication between innate and adaptive immune cells\u201d and \u201crole of pattern recognition receptors in recognition of bacteria and viruses\u201d. cellular pathways differentially regulated by wild-type and reassortant viruses on day 1 p.i.a Molecular ratioc Low-pathogenicity-virus vs high-pathogenicity-virus vs mock infection (2,289 DE genes) a Functional analysis was performed using IPA software. the Benjamini-Hochberg (B-H) multiple testing correction for P values was applied to rank the significance associated for each pathway. pattern recognition receptors in recognition of bacteria and viruses 1.23E4 56/106 Hepatic fibrosis/hepatic stellate cell activation 2.63E4 74/146 1918HA/K173 vs mock (8,913 DE genes) Protein ubiquitination pathway 6.03E10 137/268 Hepatic fibrosis/hepatic stellate cell activation 4.68E6 77/146 Remodeling of epithelial adherens junctions viruses 2.40E8 35/106 Cross talk between dendritic cells and natural killer cells 6.76E7 31/95 Antigen presentation 2.19E6 18/40 Communication between innate and adaptive immune cells 1.20E5 29/109 1918 virus vs 1918HA/K173 infection (283 DE genes) Interferon signaling 3.47E3 5/36 Role of JAK1, JAK2 and TYK2 in interferon signaling 7.41E3 4/27 IL-15 production 7. HA of 1918 and 1918HA/K173 viruses evoke similar, though not identical, host responses. this suggests that HA of 1918 virus induces a transcriptional signature comparable to that of fully reconstructed 1918 virus. previous studies have shown increased activation of proinflammatory, pronecrotic, and stress response genes in the lung. 1918 virus elicited greater upregulation of IL-15, IL15RA, KLRK1 and KLRC1 genes. a total of 283 genes distinguished 1918 virus from 1918HA/K173 virus. the difference in magnitude of gene expression may account for accelerated morbidity. 1918 and 1918HA/K173 viruses differentially regulate lymphocyte gene expression in lungs of the virus-infected mice. average log2(ratio) gene expression in infected lungs relative to that in mock-infected lungs is shown. ligand 1 NM_011329 6.86 3.40 CD180 CD180 molecule NM_008533 8.32 4.36 CD3E CD3e molecule, epsilon (CD3-TCR complex) BC028636 1.13 1.73 CFLAR CASP8 and FADD-like apoptosis regulator Y14041 1.73 1.13 CLEC4E C-type lectin domain family 4, member E NM_019948 17.27 11.28 beta 1, fibroblast NM_010510 61.24 131.86 IL-10 Interleukin 10 NM_010548 3.32 2.40 IL-11 Interleukin 11 NM_008350 10.36 24.89 IL12RB1 Interleukin 12 receptor, beta 1 NM_008353 8.52 3.87 IL-15 Interleukin 15 NM_008357 2.31 1.48 IL15RA Interleukin 18 binding protein NM_0 TNLAa Resistin like alpha NM_020509 1.65 3.72 SCGB3A1 Secretoglobin, family 3A, member 1 NM_170727 18.26 9.30 SCGB3A2 Secretoglobin, family 3A, member 2 NM_054038 35.21 16.34 SOCS1 Suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 NM_009896 12.73 6.87 SPRR1A Small proline-rich protein 1A NM_ recombinant virus expressing 1918 virus HA (10) increased expression of the transcription factor genes STAT3 and NF-IL-6, the heme-related target protein genes HPX and HMOX1 and the complement component genes C1R and C2. clade A (alpha-1 antiproteinase, antitrypsin), member 1 BC037008 1.47 1.95 SERPINA3 Serpin peptidase inhibitor, clade A (alpha-1 antiproteinase, antitrypsin), member 3 NM_009252 4.15 43.13 SERPING1 Serpin peptidase inhibitor, clade G (C1 inhibitor), member 1 NM_009776 2.04 3.45 SHP2 transcriptional changes of 134 inflammatory response genes in response to infection. average log2(ratio) gene expression of infected lung relative to mock is shown. red indicates that the gene expression is higher than that in the uninfected reference. we examined functional relationships for 56 genes changing more than 2-fold in both 1918 and 1918HA/K173 infections. there was representation of genes related to protein ubiquitination (UBE2L6 and UBE4A), catabolism of ATP (PSMC1, PSMC5, and PSMC6), protein folding (B2M and HSPB1), and the degradation of ubiquitin-protein conjugates (USP18 and USP3). average log2(ratio) gene expression of high-pathogenicity virus group relative to mock infection. red indicates that the gene expression is higher than in the mock-infected reference; green indicates that gene expression is lower than in the mock-infected reference.
