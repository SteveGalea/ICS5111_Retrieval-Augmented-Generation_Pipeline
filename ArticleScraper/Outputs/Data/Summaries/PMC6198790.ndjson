{"summary": "introduction tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death due to an infectious disease. one third of the world's population harbors Mtb in a latent state serving as a large reservoir. these individuals are potentially at risk of developing active disease again and spreading it easily to the remaining population. a phase 1 clinical trial for safety and tolerability was conducted using a recombinant BCG that expressed a) immunodominant antigens seen in active infection and during reactivation from latency (Ag85A, Ag85B and Rv3407) and b) a mutant perfringolysin (PFOG137Q) derived from Clostridium perfringens, able to perforate the endosomal membrane (10, 11), the efficacy of these experimental vaccines remains to be determined. early secreted antigenic target 6 kDa protein (ESAT-6) is a potent antigen expressed in pathogenic Mtb. the gene encoding ESAT-6 belongs to the RD-1 region. lipopeptides of LP-ESAT-6 based subunit (LP-ESAT-6) vaccine could be potentially used to boost BCG as a prophylactic vaccine. post-exposure boost in BCG primed mice led to a significant decrease in Mtb bacterial loads compared to the BCG vaccine group. all lipopeptides were dissolved in DMSO at 10 mg/ml. all lipopeptides were diluted with PBS or medium prior to use. the schedule of administration of BCG and LP-ESAT-6 is shown in Figure 1I. decrease in Mtb loads depends on schedule of the boost in heterologous prime-boost with BCG/LP-ESAT-6 boost. mice were injected with 5 105 CFU/mouse of Mtb H37Ra intravenously. lungs, liver and spleen were removed aseptically and individually homogenized. a 100 l aliquot was taken from each organ homogenate of individual mice. a dilution of 1:2\u20131:10 was used for the samples with the standards ranging from 2 to 2,000 pg/ml. ELISA plates were read with an automated ELISA plate reader. splenocytes purified by nylon wool were used as recall antigen. staining, 2 106 splenocytes were cultured for 4 days with medium only, peptide pools (1 g/ml of each lipopeptide) on day 5, brefeldin A (1.5 g/ml, 1 X; eBioscience) was added. stained for extracellular markers CD3-PE Cy7, CD4-PE Cy5, CD8-APC-Cy7, and intracellular cytokines IFN--PE and IL-10 five-to six-week-old female BALB/c mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories. all lipopeptides were dissolved in DMSO at 10 mg/ml, stored at 20\u00b0C, and diluted with PBS or medium prior to use. mice were immunized with a pool of lipopeptides (LP-ESAT-6) for subunit boost immunization. the schedule of administration of BCG and LP-ESAT-6 is shown in Figure 1I. mice were injected with 5 105 CFU/mouse of Mtb H37Ra intravenously. four weeks after Mtb infection, mice were euthanized. lungs, liver and spleen were removed aseptically and individually homogenized. fluids were centrifuged at 1,500 rpm for 10 min. cell pellet was resuspended in 500 l of sterile distilled water. tube was vortexed briefly and volume was made to 2 ml. obtained lymphocytes were used for staining. brefeldin A (1.5 g/ml, 1 X; eBioscience, CA, United States) was added. 2 106 splenocytes were cultured for 4 days with medium only, peptide pools (1 g/ml of each lipopeptide) data were analyzed using Graphpad Prism software (Graphpad Software Inc., CA, United States) data were presented as mean SD of 3-5 replicate values. significant differences between two groups or more than two groups were analyzed. a significant number of papers in immunization field use 8\u201314 days post-immunization to evaluate the induction of adaptive immunity. the effect of adjuvant (MPL) used is on innate immunity and not expected to last for 14 days. the results of infection were determined by examining viable counts of Mtb in lungs, liver and spleen. subunit vaccine in pre-exposure settings did not enhance protection over BCG-alone based on lungs and spleen but not liver. intriguingly, when BCG-primed animals were boosted with LP-ESAT-6 subunit vaccine after Mtb infection as in post-exposure schedule, there was a remarkable reduction in pulmonary and extra pulmonary bacterial loads. increased levels of IFN-, IL-17A, and IL-22 and a decrease in IL-10 compared to the unvaccinated group. no significant difference in IL-22 levels was found between BCG alone vaccinated and pre-exposure boosted groups. tes significant difference (P > 0.05) between the compared groups and \u201cNS\u201d represents not significant (P > 0.05) data are representative of two different repeated experiments. boosting with LP-ESAT-6 subunit vaccine enhances the infiltration of T cells in BALs T cells infiltrating airways. boosting BCG-primed responses with LP-ESAT-6 subunit vaccine results in an enhanced infiltration of activated CD4+, CD8+, and CD4CD8 T cells. this could at least partially account for the enhanced protection over BCG-alone. female BALB/c mice (n = 5/group) were immunized according to the pre-exposure or post-exposure schedule shown in Figure 1. intranasal boosting with LP-ESAT-6 subunit vaccine at different schedules i.e., pre- and post-exposure, distinguishes the systemic T cell responses induced against the boosting antigen. results are expressed as stimulation indices, obtained by dividing counts per minute of antigen-stimulated culture with that of the medium-solvent control culture. exposure boost group, compared to the respective LP-ESAT-6 subunit group. results suggest that immunization with BCG may lead to modulation of T cells that compromises response to the subunit vaccine. if the boost is given after Mtb infection, it is able to re-educate the immune system. a post-exposure boost with LP-ESAT-6 subunit vaccine provided higher reduction in Mtb viable counts, higher IFN- levels in the BALs and higher proliferation of splenocytes in antigen-dependent manner. we then sought to examine the functional attributes of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in splenocytes stimulated ex vivo with PPD or LP mix as recall antigens. ex vivo stimulation of splenocytes with LP mix did not lead to a significant increase in IL-10-producing CD4+ T cells in unvaccinated, BCG-alone and LP-ESAT-6MPL groups. however, ex vivo stimulation of splenocytes with LP mix did not lead to a significant increase in IL-10-producing CD4+ T cells in unvaccinated, BCG-alone and LP-ESAT-6 intracellular IFN- and IL-10 are differentially expressed in antigen-specific CD4+ (I) and CD8+ (II) T cells in mice boosted with LP-ESAT-6 subunit vaccine in pre-exposure or post-exposure schedule. female BALB/c mice (n = 5/group) were immunized according to pre-exposure or post-exposure schedule shown in Figure 1. mean standard deviation from triplicate cultures from spleen cells pooled from five individual mice is shown at the bottom. spleen cells obtained from mice were examined for GrB expression in NK, NKT and CD8+ T cells without ex vivo re-stimulation. unvaccinated BCG alone LP-ESAT-6 boost LP-ESAT-6+MPL in both pre- and post-exposure groups. these experiments indicate that boost with LP-ESAT-6 subunit vaccine leads to overall increase in granzyme B (GrB)-producing effector lymphocytes including NK and NKT and CD8+ T cells. a significant number of papers in immunization field use 8\u201314 days post-immunization. a significant number of papers in immunization field use 8\u201314 days post-immunization. the effect of adjuvant (MPL) used is on innate immunity. this schedule allowed us to maintain consistent time-frame after initial BCG priming. mice vaccinated with BCG alone or unvaccinated mice were used as controls. LP-ESAT-6 boosted groups in both lungs and spleen compared to BCG-alone vaccinated mice. reduction in pulmonary and extra pulmonary bacterial loads in liver and spleen. addition of adjuvant MPL to LP-ESAT-6 subunit vaccine further enhanced protection. BCG-primed mice were boosted with LP-ESAT-6 subunit vaccine after infection with Mtb. there were higher levels of IFN-, IL-17A, and IL-22 and lower levels of IL-10. no significant difference in IL-17A levels was found between BCG alone vaccinated and pre-exposure boosted groups. LP-ESAT-6 subunit vaccine enhances the infiltration of T cells in BALs. the results showed that the frequency of infiltrating CD4+ T cells was higher in LP-ESAT-6 subunit boosted mice compared to BCG-alone groups. the frequency of infiltrating CD4+ and CD4CD8 T cells was significantly enhanced in the post-exposure boost group compared to BCG-alone and pre-exposure boost groups. boosting with LP-ESAT-6 subunit vaccine in BCG-primed mice leads to enhanced recruitment of immune cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids. female BALB/c mice (n = 5/group) were immunized according to the pre-exposure or post-exposure schedule shown in Figure 1. we performed a bulk T cell proliferation assay using splenocytes obtained from different experimental groups after ex vivo stimulation with Mtb or individual lipopeptides of the LP-ESAT-6 subunit vaccine. results are expressed as stimulation indices, obtained by dividing counts per minute of antigen-stimulated culture with that of the corresponding medium-solvent control culture. female BALB/c mice (n = 5/group) were immunized according to the pre-exposure or post-exposure schedule shown in Figure 1. spleens were collected from (A) pre-exposure boost and (B) post-exposure boost groups to examine the antigen-specific proliferation of T cells. a post-exposure boost with LP-ESAT-6 subunit vaccine provided higher reduction in Mtb viable counts, higher IFN- levels in the BALs and higher proliferation of splenocytes in antigen-dependent manner. we then sought to examine the functional attributes of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in splenocytes stimulated ex vivo with PPD or LP mix as recall antigens. a significant increase in IL-10-producing CD4+ T cells in unvaccinated, BCG-alone and LP-ESAT-6MPL groups. boosting with the LP-ESAT-6 subunit did not lead to CD4+ T cells producing high levels of IL-10. in response to PPD there was induction of IFN- and IL-10-producing CD8+T cells after BCG vaccination. female BALB/c mice (n = 5/group) were immunized according to pre-exposure or post-exposure schedule shown in Figure 1. spleen cells obtained from 5 mice immunized with lipopeptide P1 and P4-P7 were cultured for 4 days with or without PPD. cells were gated for CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+. NK, NKT and CD8+ T cells are prominent cytotoxic lymphocytes. splenocytes obtained from mice were examined for GrB expression in NK, NKT and CD8+ T cells without ex vivo re-stimulation. female BALB/c mice (n = 5/group) were immunized according to the pre-exposure or post-exposure schedule shown in Figure 1. spleen cells obtained from individual mice were cultured for 5 h with Brefeldin A (1.5 g/ml) 1X. a number of fusion protein-based subunit vaccines are being tested as boosters to BCG. weak immunogenicity of protein/peptide-based vaccines requires a safe and effective adjuvant, which in itself poses issues. this approach would not stringently conform to the classical definition of boosting. most of the post-exposure or therapeutic vaccines previously studied were evaluated in BCG-nave or BCG-vaccinated healthy individuals (14, 18, 19) traditional prime-boost vaccine approaches require administration of the booster vaccine at various times after the priming vaccine to prevent an infection. but the timing, dose and route of which still remains to be debated. LP-ESAT-6 subunit vaccine demonstrated promising efficacy against pulmonary TB. it was designed to test LP-ESAT-6 as both a prophylactic (pre-exposure) and therapeutic (post-exposure) vaccine in mice primed with BCG. this group was not included due to our experimental design focusing on BCG primed animals. tb which then get boosted upon administration of the LP-ESAT-6 subunit vaccine or the productive infection allows re-education of recent thymic emigrant (RTE) T cells. infection with Mtb is capable of supporting the activation of recent thymic emigrants. compared to healthy people, CD4+ T cells producing IL-22 and IL-17A have been reported to be upregulated in BAL fluids of pulmonary TB patients. the exact cellular source of these cytokines in BAL fluids is also not clear and could be from adaptive lymphocytes. BCG vaccine has been known to predominantly induce CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. attempts to broaden the response toward both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses have included boosting with recombinant adenovirus vector containing Ag85A and B. recombinant BCG is also known to induce CD8+ Tregs. CD4 T cells demonstrate features of antigen-experienced T cells. IL-10 has been shown to limit the expansion of DN T cells. double negative memory T cells in lungs with functional properties similar to CD8+ T cells react to influenza virus infection. antigen-dependent IFN- and IL-10 production in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells demonstrated to be efficient effectors for intracellular pathogens. IL-10-producing CD8+ T cells have been shown to reflect cytotoxic T lymphocytes with superior effector (cytolytic) function. boosting with LP-ESAT-6 subunit vaccine increased GrB expression in splenocytes compared to BCG vaccination alone in the post-exposure boost group. boosting with LP-ESAT-6 subunit vaccine may be inducing memory-like effects in NK and NKT cells. boosting with LP-ESAT-6 may be inducing memory-like effects in NK and NKT cells. studies have shed important light on this key question. further work is needed to determine the reasons/mechanisms for the inability of a pre-exposure boost with LP-ESAT-6 subunit vaccine to enhance protection compared to BCG alone. however, these studies provide immense promise for development of a subunit vaccine for BCG-vaccinated individuals who still get active TB infection."}{"summary": "introduction tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death due to an infectious disease. one third of the world's population harbors Mtb in a latent state serving as a large reservoir. these individuals are potentially at risk of developing active disease again and spreading it easily to the remaining population. a phase 1 clinical trial for safety and tolerability was conducted using a recombinant BCG that expressed a) immunodominant antigens seen in active infection and during reactivation from latency (Ag85A, Ag85B and Rv3407) and b) a mutant perfringolysin (PFOG137Q) derived from Clostridium perfringens, able to perforate the endosomal membrane (10, 11), the efficacy of these experimental vaccines remains to be determined. early secreted antigenic target 6 kDa protein (ESAT-6) is a potent antigen expressed in pathogenic Mtb. the gene encoding ESAT-6 belongs to the RD-1 region. lipopeptides of LP-ESAT-6 based subunit (LP-ESAT-6) vaccine could be potentially used to boost BCG as a prophylactic vaccine. post-exposure boost in BCG primed mice led to a significant decrease in Mtb bacterial loads compared to the BCG vaccine group. all lipopeptides were dissolved in DMSO at 10 mg/ml. all lipopeptides were diluted with PBS or medium prior to use. the schedule of administration of BCG and LP-ESAT-6 is shown in Figure 1I. decrease in Mtb loads depends on schedule of the boost in heterologous prime-boost with BCG/LP-ESAT-6 boost. mice were injected with 5 105 CFU/mouse of Mtb H37Ra intravenously. lungs, liver and spleen were removed aseptically and individually homogenized. a 100 l aliquot was taken from each organ homogenate of individual mice. a dilution of 1:2\u20131:10 was used for the samples with the standards ranging from 2 to 2,000 pg/ml.
