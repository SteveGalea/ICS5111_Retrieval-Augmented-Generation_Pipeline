{"summary": "influenza is the most extensively studied of the respiratory viruses, causing infections in 10\u201320% of the world\u2019s population. virus such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human enterovirus/rhinovirus (HEV/HRV), adenovirus, and parainfluenza are also associated with a significant burden of disease. consecutive adults and children 1 year presenting to the OPD with acute respiratory tract infections were screened for enrollment by trained study physicians from March 2013 to January 2015. patients were eligible for enrollment if they met criteria for influenza-like illness (ILI), as defined by the world health organization (WHO) this rapid chromatographic immunoassay detects influenza A and B viral nucleoprotein antigens from nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs using a single processed sample. in pediatric patients, the sensitivity and specificity of the test when compared with PCR were 90.2% and 99.1%. sociodemographic characteristics between patients with a positive versus negative respiratory viral test and patients with a positive influenza versus positive other respiratory viral test were compared using the Spearman correlation. bivariable logistic regression was carried out to determine the association between patients\u2019 sociodemographic characteristics/clinical symptoms and viral PCR test results. cross-sectional study performed in the outpatient department (OPD) of the largest public, tertiary care hospital in the southern province of Sri Lanka. patients were eligible for enrollment if they met criteria for influenza-like illness (ILI) all patients were tested with the Veritor Flu A+B rapid influenza kit. this rapid chromatographic immunoassay detects influenza A and B viral nucleoprotein antigens from nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs using a single processed sample. the performance characteristics of the test were documented by Hassan and others. monthly weather data were obtained for the Galle region from the Sri Lanka Department of Meteorology (Colombo, Sri Lanka) correlation between weather data and the monthly proportion of subjects with ILI or influenza by PCR was determined using the Spearman correlation. all analyses were performed using JMP PRO, Version 11 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) and STATA, version 11 (STATACorp, College Station, TX).

were found to have a viral pathogen. influenza was the most common etiology, but other viruses such as HEV/HRV and parainfluenza did not appear to have a clear seasonal association. influenza accounted for the largest burden of disease in our study. the reason for variation in seasonality within the country is not clear, but underscores the need for further studies. the WHO\u2019s recommendations regarding timing and composition of influenza vaccination are based on a country\u2019s location in the Northern or Southern hemisphere. however, studies suggest such recommendations may not be applicable for more than half of countries in the tropical belt, given variable influenza activity. studies from higher-income settings have reported similar results with the Veritor flu A+B rapid influenza test. the use of a rapid test with good performance characteristics in settings with limited laboratory infrastructure has the potential to individualize patient treatment and add to local data on influenza epidemiology. influenza was the largest contributor to respiratory infections, with peak activity during March\u2013June. other viruses such as HEV/HRV and RSV also contributed to disease burden."}
