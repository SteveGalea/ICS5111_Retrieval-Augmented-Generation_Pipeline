{"summary": "herpes simplex infection (HSV-1) has been shown to be a risk factor in Alzheimer's disease. acting in synergy with possession of the APOE4 allele HSV-1 infection in mice or neuroblastoma cells increases beta-amyloid deposition and phosphorylation of the microtubule protein tau. viral infection also results in hippocampal and entorhinal cortex neuronal degeneration, brain shrinkage, and memory loss, all as found in antigenicity was predicted using the BepiPred server [9] at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/BepiPred/ and T cell epitopes predicted using the Immune epitope database resource at http://tools.immuneepitope.org/main/html/tcell_tools.html [10]. the results of the HSV-1 BLASTS, sized according to the number of viral hits per protein, are shown in Table 2. all of the genes encoding for these proteins with the exception of those with the strikethrough have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease in genetic association studies. BLAST returns the human proteins with the greatest homology to viral proteins. the unfiltered BLAST showed that herpes simplex viral proteins are highly homologous to a series of family members of diverse protein kinases. the homology is such as to suggest that such phosphorylation may be accomplished by the viral proteins themselves. simplex virus as APOE4, clusterin, complement receptor 1, and PICALM are homologous to proteins from a diverse array of phages and viruses. many proteins will be homologous to proteins from specific subsets of viruses. several herpes species other than HSV-1 (HSV-2, 3, 6, 6B, and 8) fall into this category. the protein sequences highlighted in grey in Table 3 contain strings of herpes simplex proteins that have been shown to bind to several interactome partners of tau. these include APOE4, complement receptor 1, clusterin, insulin degrading enzyme, the APP homologue, APLP2, the collagen amyloid plaque component CLAC, synuclein, and the foetal Alzheimer antigen, ALZ50. vatches within Beta-Amyloid and the Microtubule Protein tau Vatches are short contiguous amino acid stretches that are identical in viral and human proteins. there are several million within the human proteome, derived from evolutionary descent and from the insertion of multiple viruses into the human genome over millions of years. reinsertions appear to be responsible for the creation of gene families. the repetitive patterns in the pictogram reflect homology with a number of different lipoprotein receptors located on different chromosomes. some of the vatches within beta-amyloid and tau correspond to highly antigenic regions of APP or tau, and therefore also of the HSV-1 proteins.

AST of human chromosome 10 against all viral genomes returned 119,867 hits, covering the entire chromosome, with no gaps, in both inter- and intragenic regions. our genomes and polymorphisms thus determine which vatches we possess, which viruses pose the threat, and which viral-related disease we are likely to develop. this phenomenon appears to be universal, as vatches have been found in the XMRV virus, relating to human proteins involved in mitochondrial respir all viruses so far screened (30) express homology to a large but specific subset of human proteins. these viral homologues may interfere with Alzheimer's disease pathological pathways in a number of ways. these homologues may also interfere with their protein/protein networks (interactome) large increases in IgG levels have been recorded in the brain parenchyma, in apoptotic dying neurones, and in cerebral blood vessels in the Alzheimer's disease brain. the membrane attack complex (MAC) composed of complement proteins C5 to C9 forms a channel that is inserted into the membranes of pathogens, destroying them by lysis. MAC complex is present in dystrophic neurites and neurofibrillary tangles, along with deposition of beta-amyloid autoantibodies are common in the ageing population and in Alzheimer's disease. this is a characteristic of both beta-amyloid and of HSV-1 glycoprotein B peptide fragments containing this sequence. other stretches of beta-amyloid are homologous to a diverse set of viral, bacterial, fungal, and allergenic proteins. a large number of Alzheimer's disease susceptibility gene candidates are intimately concerned with pathogen defence and or the immune system. beta-amyloid vaccination in Alzheimer's disease has so far not been successful. there is an evident risk that they may also trigger an autoimmune response, potentially killing beta-amyloid containing neurones. the cytomegalovirus, Borrelia, Burgdorferi, Chlamydia Pneumoniae, Helicobacter pylori, Cryptococcus neoformans and bacteria promoting gum disease express proteins homologous to the products of numerous Alzheimer's disease susceptibility genes. the potential dangers of vaccine-related autoimmunity evidently need to be addressed. patients with myasthenia gravis (characterised by autoantibodies to nicotinic receptors) [74] may also be of benefit. detailed and regular pathogen screens in the ageing population may also be of use. there are almost 3,000 viral genomes in the NCBI database."}
