{"summary": "the pharmaceutical industry spends far more on research and development but produces fewer new molecules than 20 years ago. silico methods will become a dominant tool to address this issue, from drug discovery to marketing. up until now, these techniques have helped design about 50 compounds that entered clinical trials. docking is a vigorous research area, and is now among the most useful tools for in silico drug design and a primary component in many drug discovery programs [4\u20138] docking can be roughly described as the combination of a search algorithm that intends to suggest several possible ligand poses. the most widely used are AutoDock [9, 10], Genetic Optimisation for Ligand Docking [11, 12], FlexX [13]/FlexE [14], DOCK [3, 15] and internal coordinate Mechanics (ICM) [16]/ICM-flexible receptor docking algorithm (IFREDA) [17]. the main exceptions are GOLD, AutoDock, DOCK and EADock, which apply some flexibility to the protein during the docking through active site side chains rotations. the main exceptions are FlexE and the IFREDA which use a set of different pre-generated receptor conformations obtained experimentally or with in silico approaches. the best candidates are further refined via a Monte Carlo sampling of pose conformation to improve their accuracy. evolutionary algorithms (EA) and MC simulations fall into this category. an objective function assigns a score to each binding mode. simulation methods group molecular dynamics and minimization methods. they are often unable to cross high-energy barriers within feasible simulation time periods. however, they are rarely employed as stand-alone search techniques. docking programs generally approximate the exact force-field energy using a grid summation. the binding energy of a ligand is then calculated by summing the contribution of the grid points occupied by the small molecule. a docking is considered successful if the root mean square deviation between the experimental and calculated binding modes is lower than 2. docking a ligand to a non-native protein conformer is a more difficult task. this is not the case when the ligand is taken from a screening database or is designed by in silico methods. this is not the case when the ligand is taken from a screening database. systematic search algorithms (FlexX or FlexE, DOCK, Glide [18], Hammerhead [19], EADock and simulation approaches. the ideal systematic exploration of all DOF in a molecule to find its native binding mode is usually an impossible task due to the combinatorial explosion of the search space. MC-based methods start from a single randomly generated pose. step-by-step changes are applied to a starting pose or a population of poses. such methods subsequently score the new poses at each step trying to enhance the interactions with the protein. simulation methods group molecular dynamics and minimization methods. they are often unable to cross high-energy barriers within feasible simulation time periods. however, they are rarely employed as stand-alone search techniques. a docking is considered successful if the root mean square deviation between the experimental and calculated binding modes is lower than 2. the typical success rate for re-docking ranges from 70% to 80%, depending on the authors and the test sets. ligand is taken from a screening database or is designed by in silico methods. success rate of docking programs is reduced by at least 20%. but progress might be expected from methods developed to handle the protein flexibility in a fast and efficient way. structure-based vHTS Structure-based vHTS is probably the most straightforward application of docking algorithms. it consists of using a molecular docking program to determine the binding mode on the protein target for an entire database of existing or virtual compounds. the most promising compounds are retained for further experimental testing. structure-based vHTS consists of using a molecular docking program to determine the binding mode on the protein target for an entire database of existing or virtual compounds. the most promising compounds are retained for further experimental testing. vHTS suffers from a lot of false negatives. this review will focus on in silico approaches. first, FBD samples a higher chemical diversity than vHTS. this only covers a tiny amount of the chemical space accessible to the molecules. a high proportion of the atoms in a fragment hit are directly involved in protein-binding interactions with the target. the compounds found by HTS are complex and full molecules often exhibiting sub-optimal binding interactions with the target. this leads to molecules with a higher ligand efficiency. 12 DOF are frozen upon binding of the two separated fragments A and B. this leads to a higher entropic penalty than when freezing the 6 DOF of the A:B joined molecule. favourable difference in rigid body entropy prevails the conformational entropic loss of the A:B molecule.
