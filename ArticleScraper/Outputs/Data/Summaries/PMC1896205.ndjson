{"summary": "advanced disease-surveillance systems have been deployed worldwide to provide early detection of infectious disease outbreaks and bioterrorist attacks. most current generation surveillance systems are vulnerable to dramatic and unpredictable shifts in health-care data that they monitor. these shifts can occur during major public events, such as the Olympics, as a result of population surges and public closures. the results show that the network models provide better localized outbreak detection under normal circumstances. the main task of public-health officials is to promote health in communities around the world. the main task of public-health officials is to promote health in communities around the world. researchers developed a new class of surveillance systems called \"epidemiological network models\" these systems aim to improve the detection of disease outbreaks by monitoring fluctuations in the relationships between information detailing the use of various health-care resources over time (data streams) researchers used data collected over a 3-y period from five Boston hospitals on visits for respiratory (breathing) problems and for gastrointestinal (stomach and gut) problems. public-health officials could improve their ability to detect disease outbreaks by using epidemiological network systems alongside their current disease-surveillance systems. a detailed report from the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention called \u201cFramework for evaluating public health surveillance systems for the early Detection of Outbreaks\u201d. 66.7% reported doing so during the SARS epidemic in Hong Kong [13]. a detailed study of the Greater Toronto Area found major drops in health-care utilization during the epidemic. david frum: public-health interventions such as closures, quarantines, travel restrictions can cause major changes in health-care utilization patterns. an epidemiological network begins with historical time-series models of the ratios between each possible pair of data streams being monitored. the ratios predicted by these historical models are compared with the ratios observed in the actual data in order to determine whether an aberration has occurred. these network models have two primary benefits: first, they take advantage of the extra information present in the relationships between the monitored data streams in order to increase overall detection performance. data obtained from the Centre for Epidemiology and Research, New South Wales Department of Health, New South Wales Emergency Department Data Collection. the data show a 5% surge in visits during the 2000 summer Olympics. injury visits accounted for 21.50% of overall visits in 1999, compared with an almost identical 21.53% in 2000. bioSense collects and analyzes health-care utilization data from a number of national data sources. the models were evaluated using semi-synthetic data-streams. the data cover a period of 1,619 d, or roughly 4.5 y. the goal of an epidemiological network model is to model the historical relationships among health-care data streams. in the training phase, we construct time-series models of the ratios between all possible pairs of health-care utilization data streams. each data stream appears twice, once as a context data stream and another time as a target data stream. a time-series model, Rij, is fitted for each ratio, Rij, over the training period using established time-series methods. each edge represents the ratio of the target node divided by the context node, with a thicker edge indicating that the ratio is higher than expected. the data are smoothed with a 7-d exponential filter (EWMA with coefficient 0.5) to reduce the effects of noise. if the observed ratio between these two data streams is exactly as predicted by the historical model, eij is equal to 0 and wij is equal to a moderate value closer to 1. high aberration scores, wij, are represented by thicker edges in the network visualization, as shown in Figure 1. a substantial decrease in the count in the context data stream will trigger a false alarm in a target data stream. reference time-series surveillance model uses the same time-series modeling methods described above and previously [19]. multiple simulation experiments are performed, varying the number of data streams used in the network, the target data stream, Si, into which the outbreaks are introduced, and the magnitude of the outbreaks. simulated outbreaks serve as a paradigmatic set of benchmark stimuli for gauging the relative outbreak-detection performance of different surveillance approaches. in the training phase, we construct time-series models of the ratios between all possible pairs of health-care utilization data streams. the actual observed ratios are compared with the ratios predicted by the historical models. we use three syndromic categories (respiratory, gastrointestinal, and total visits) at five hospitals. a time-series model, Rij, is fitted for each ratio, Rij, over the training period using established time-series methods. the data are smoothed with a 7-d exponential filter (EWMA with coefficient 0.5) to reduce the effects of noise. the linear trend is calculated and subtracted out, then the overall mean is calculated and subtracted out, then the day-of-week means (seven values) are calculated and subtracted out. the target data stream is higher than expected, eij is positive and wij is a higher value closer to 1. high aberration scores, wij, are represented by thicker edges in the network visualization, as shown in Figure 1. it is important to note that each individual aberration score, wij, can be affected by the activities of its target and context data streams. reference time-series model models each health-care data stream directly, instead of modeling the relationships between data streams as above. first, the daily counts data are smoothed with a 7-d exponential filter. the linear trend is calculated and subtracted out, then the mean for each day of the year (365 values) is calculated and subtracted out. multiple simulation experiments are performed, varying the number of data streams used in the network, the target data stream, and the magnitude of the outbreaks. simulated outbreaks serve as a paradigmatic set of benchmark stimuli for gauging the relative outbreak-detection performance of the different surveillance approaches. at 95% specificity, the network approach significantly outperformed the reference approach in detecting respiratory and gastrointestinal outbreaks. the reference model achieved 2.1% 2% better absolute sensitivity than the network model (2.9% difference in relative sensitivity), making it easier for the reference model to detect the outbreaks. the integrated consensus scores consolidated the information from the individual aberration scores. the responses of the 210 individual aberration scores are shown, grouped by target node. the integrated consensus score for each target data stream successfully reconstructs the simulated outbreaks presented to the system. total-visits data streams provided the best context for detection. this is consistent with the greater statistical stability of the total-visits data streams. the number of injected cases is a constant proportion of stream size. a cell is colored if the context group represented by that column was used in the network for that row. rows are ranked by the average sensitivity achieved. the results of the above analysis are shown for respiratory (Figure 7), gastrointestinal (Figure 8), and total-visit target signals. each row represents a different network construction. a cell is colored if the context group represented by that column was used in the network for that row. rows are ranked by the average sensitivity achieved. full networks, total-visit networks, two-node networks (target data stream and total visits at the same hospital) and reference models are compared. average results are shown for each target data stream type. in one syndromic category, a targeted rise is introduced in only one type of data stream. full networks, respiratory- or gastrointestinal-only networks, two-node networks, and reference models are compared. error bars are standard errors. at 95% specificity, the network approach significantly outperformed the reference approach in detecting respiratory and gastrointestinal outbreaks. the reference model achieved 2.1% 2% better absolute sensitivity than the network model (2.9% difference in relative sensitivity), making it easier for the reference model to detect the outbreaks. the integrated consensus scores consolidated the information from the individual aberration scores. the responses of the 210 individual aberration scores are shown, grouped by target node. the integrated consensus score for T-5 successfully reconstructs the simulated outbreaks presented to the system. total-visits data streams provided the best context for detection. this is consistent with the greater statistical stability of the total-visits data streams. the number of injected cases is a constant proportion of stream size. a cell is colored if the context group represented by that column was used in the network for that row. rows are ranked by the average sensitivity achieved. the results of the above analysis are shown for respiratory (Figure 7), gastrointestinal (Figure 8), and total-visit target signals. simulated outbreaks of peak magnitude 37.5%, we introduced various types and magnitudes of baseline shifts for a period of 200 d in the middle of the 405-d testing period. full networks, total-visit networks, two-node networks (target data stream and total visits at the same hospital) and reference models are compared. average results are shown for each target data stream type. a targeted rise is introduced in only one type of data stream. full networks, respiratory- or gastrointestinal-only networks, two-node networks, and reference models are compared. errors are standard errors. a rise in one syndrome group across all locations may correspond to a widespread outbreak. such a signal would be detected by network models that include multiple locations. the next four classes of signals involve decreases in one or more data streams. the two-node networks described above are similar in certain ways to the \u201crate\u201d-based approach used by a small number of surveillance systems today [24\u201327] instead of monitoring daily counts directly, these systems monitor daily counts as a proportion of the total counts. the approach presented here is fundamentally different in that it explicitly models and tracks all possible inter-data stream relationships, not just those between a particular data stream. a systematic study of the models' responses to different magnitudes of both broad and targeted baseline shifts. the two-node approach works well under normal conditions, but not as robust to targeted shifts in health-care utilization as larger network models. the results therefore show that there is value in modeling all, or a selected combination of the relationships between health-care data streams. limitations of this study include the use of simulated infectious disease outbreaks and baseline shift patterns. this approach allows us to create a paradigmatic set of conditions for evaluating the relative outbreak-detection performance of the various approaches. it is also possible to develop this method further to track outbreaks in multiple hospitals and syndrome groups. also possible to study the effects on timeliness of detection of different network approaches."}
