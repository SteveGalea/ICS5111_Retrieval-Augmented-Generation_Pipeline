{"summary": "the current study was designed to rigorously measure the reliability of a phylogenetic marker included in segment B. this marker can facilitate molecular epidemiology studies to better explain the links between emergence, spreading and maintenance of the very virulent IBD virus. infectious bursal disease (IBD) is a viral infection that was described for the first time in the 60\u2019s in Gumboro, Delaware, United States. the most important lesions observed in affected animals are lymphoid tissue damage found in the bursa of Fabricius [2]. phylogenetic analyses have revealed independent evolutionary histories for the two genome segments (A and B), suggesting that a reassortment event may have played a role in the emergence of vvIBDV [14]. most of the phylogenetic studies based on segment A use the hyper-variable region of VP2 as phylogenetic marker [18,19,20], whereas those few studies including segment B use the complete segment [21,22]. the presence of a novel IBDV natural reassortant between segments A and B was reported. the present work highlights the need to obtain information about the genetic structure of both genome segments of IBDV, to elucidate the causes of the emergence and spreading. RNA of all 42 samples was extracted from FTA cards using the method described by Moscoso et al. [282] with modifications. RNA was extracted from 150 L of supernatant recovered using Nucleospin RNA virus kit (Macherey-Nagel, D\u00fcren, Germany) the resulting products were submitted to bi-directional DNA sequencing using a BigDye Terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing kit. a consensus sequence for each gene was generated using the ChromasPro V1.5 program. sequences were submitted to the GenBank Database under accession numbers. the alignments of the sequences were performed using the algorithm ClustalW method included in the program BioEdit Sequence Alignment Editor [31].

ML trees were computed using the PHYML v3.0 [44] and confidence levels were estimated by 1000 bootstrap replicates. topologies using complete segment B and the phylogenetic marker were constructed following the methodology described above. if more than 30% of the dots fall in the center of the triangle, the data are considered unreliable for phylogenetic inference purposes. an unpaired t test with Whelch\u2019s correction was performed for statistical analysis of comparison of Ne between groups. the first 10% trees were discarded as \u2018\u2018burn-in\u2019. the tree with maximum log clade credibility was selected and visualized by FigTree v1.1.2 [48] the 41 bursal samples and the vaccine strain were printed on FTA cards, suited for the preservation of genetic material and adequate transportation. the FTA cards were sent to Centre de Recerca en Sanitat Animal, Barcelona, Spain. RNA was extracted from 150 L of supernatant recovered using Nucleospin RNA virus kit. RNA was eluted in a final volume of 60 L of nuclease free water. amplification products were visualized by electrophoresis on 1.8% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide. sequences from each amplicon were assembled, and a consensus sequence for each gene was generated using the ChromasPro V1.5 program. sequences were submitted to the GenBank Database under accession numbers (LK022327\u2013LK022343) vvIBDV N/A N/A AF527038 vvIBDV N/A N/A AF527040 vvIBDV N/A N/A AJ318897 vvIBDV N/A N/A AJ496637 vvIBDV N/A N/A AJ496637 vvIBDV N/A N/A N/A N/A AM111354 vvIBDV non-vvIBDV N/A N/A AY598355 non-vvIBDV N/A N/A AY654284 non-vvIBDV N/A N/A AY918947 non-vvIBDV N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A EF517529 non-vvIBDV N/A N vvIBDV IL3 N/A Israel AF083094 vvIBDV IL4 N/A Israel DQ679811 vvIBDV Hol N/A Netherlands AF362772 non-vvIBDV Cu-1M N/A Germany AF362772 non-vvIBDV P2 N/A Germany AF092944 vvIBDV HK46 1994 Hong Kong AF240687 * vvIBDV the best-fit model was selected using the Akaike and Bayesian information criteria (AIC and BIC) the best-fit models for the complete segment B and phylogenetic marker were selected and used. phylogenetic analysis To remove sequences with a possible recombinant event from the alignment of all sequence datasets, searches for recombinant sequences and crossover regions were performed using Geneconv [33], RDP [34], MaxChi [35,36], Chimera [35,36], BootScan [37], 3Seq [39] and LARD [40], all implemented in RDP3 Beta 4.1 [41]. ML trees were computed using the PHYML v3.0 [44] and confidence levels were estimated by 1000 bootstrap replicates. topologies were tested by the Kishino and Hasegawa test (K\u2013H) [45] and the Shimodaira\u2013Hasegawa test (S\u2013H) [46] which computed the log-likelihoods per site for each tree. topologies using complete segment B and the phylogenetic marker were constructed following the methodology described above. the loss of phylogenetic information due to substitution saturation was evaluated comparing the complete segment B and the phylogenetic marker. the level of saturation was studied by plotting the pairwise number of observed transitions versus genetic distance. a Bayesian skyline plot to infer population dynamics in terms of changing levels of relative genetic diversity (Ne) through time was performed. an unpaired t test with Whelch\u2019s correction was performed for statistical analysis of comparison of Ne between groups. the phylogenetic noise in each data set was investigated by means of likelihood mapping. the percentage of dots falling in the central area of the triangles ranged from 6.2% for the complete segment B to 11.7% for the B-marker. topologies obtained from complete segment B (complete) and B-marker (phylogenetic marker) by Bayesian Inference (BI) and maximum likelihood (ML) analyses are shown. each main lineage is denoted (red for vvIBDV lineage and blue for non-vvIBDV lineage) each lineage is denoted, for B-marker (vvIBDV lineage in red branches and non-vvIBDV lineage in blue branches), for HVR-VP2 (vvIBDV lineage in red branches, cvIBDV lineage in brown branches, avIBDV lineage in green branches and atIBDV lineage in light blue branches) the Cuban vaccine strain was grouped within the defined cluster corresponding to vvIBDV strain 0.986 0.986 0.981 0.983 0.979 0.983 0.983 0.983 0.983 0.983 0.983 0.986 0.979 0.972 0.976 0.981 0.881 0.881 1-BF3Hab97 2 0.986 0.99 0.986 0.988 0.99 0.988 0.99 0.988 0.988 0.988 0.993 0.993 0.986 0.986 0.988 0.99 0.993 0.993 0.993 0.993 0.986 0.986 0.986 0.986 0.986 0.993 0.997 0.981 0.981 0.974 0.986 0.976 0.979 0.876 0.876 9-BF29Hab04 10 0.986 1 1 1 0.993 0.993 0.993 0.983 0.983 0.981 0.879 10-BF31Hab04 11 0.986 1 1 1 0.993 0.993 0.993 1 1 1 the pattern of the triplet amino acids NEG (145\u2013147) present in vvIBDV strains was found in the Cuban vaccine strain and the field strain 117/96Pir (S2 Fig). the pattern of the triplet amino acids NEG (145\u2013147) present in non-vvIBDV strains was found in the Cuban vaccine strain. the Cuban vaccine strain and the field strains 117/96Pir and BF24Hab11 showed the signature 242D present in non-vvIBDV strains. evolutionary rates and tMRCA PS and SS analyses based on B-marker showed an exponential coalescent and an exponential, uncorrelated clock best fitted to our data. the estimated mean (95% HPD) for the substitution rate of the segment B of all populations assessed of IBDV was 7.09x10-4 the ancestor for the cluster in which Cuban strain 117/96Pir96 was located was framed around the year 1976. the ancestors for the remaining Cuban strains were defined between the years 1985 and 1986. the most probable year for the MRCA within each lineage was also denoted. decrease in Ne from its emergence to early \u201880s was observed. a mild increase in Ne was observed until year 2001 followed by a maintenance until 2011 suggesting a stability in diversity of this population. genetic diversity was statistically higher for this lineage than for the non-vvIBDV lineage. Xia\u2019s test did not support saturation for complete segment B and the B-Marker (Iss Iss.c, p 0.0001). a plot representation of the number of transitions (S) and transversions (V) versus the genetic distance (D) calculated with the GTR model. ML tree yielded from complete segment B was the best. all topologies obtained from both datasets yielded two highly divergent lineages. each lineage was strongly supported by the maximum posterior probability value of 1.00 and the highest bootstrap value of 100%. the model used for phylogenetic inference is shown on top of each panel. each lineage is denoted, for B-marker (vvIBDV lineage in red branches and non-vvIBDV lineage in blue branches), for HVR-VP2 (vvIBDV lineage in red branches, cvIBDV lineage in brown branches, atIBDV lineage in green branches and atIBDV lineage in light blue branches. nucleotides and deduced amino acid identities ranged 87.2\u2013100%. the deduced amino acid identities ranged 95.8\u2013100%. 0.874 7-45/02Hab02 8 0.986 1 1 1 0.993 0.993 0.993 0.993 0.993 0.983 0.983 0.986 0.986 0.986 0.986 0.986 0.886 8-BF12Hab02 9 0.979 0.993 0.993 0.993 0.993 0.983 0.986 0.986 0.986 0.986 0.986 0.986 0.986 0.986 0.986 0.972 0.972 0.972 0.965 0.965 0.965 0.965 0.972 0.972 0.972 0.972 0.972 0.972 0.972 0.972 0.972 0.972 0.972 0.972 0.972 0.972 0.972 0.972 0.972 0.972 0.972 0.972 0.972 0.972 0.972 0.972 0.972 0.972 0.972 0.972 0.972 0.972 0.9 Hab00, 45/02Hab02, BF29Hab04, BF31Hab04, BF14Cie08, BF16Hab08, BF19Hab09 and BF25Hab11 showed the signature 242E present in vvIBDV strains. the Cuban vaccine strain and the field strains 117/96Pir and BF24Hab11 showed the signature 242D present in non-vv vvIBDV 4.80x10-3(8.99x10-4-1.34x10-3) 1981 (1965\u20131987) non-vvIBDV 1.88x10-4(1.11x10-6-5.18x10-4) 1917 (1810\u20131965): substitution per site per year. most recent samples were located at the most distal tips. the BSP for both IBDV lineages showed different patterns for Ne. for non-vvIBDV lineage, a decrease in Ne from its emergence to early \u201880s was observed. a mild increase in Ne was observed until year 2001 followed by a maintenance until 2011, suggesting a stability in diversity of this population. the sudden and dramatic emergence of vvIBDV strains still represents a considerable threat to the poultry industry. the polygenic nature of IBDV pathogenicity has shown that the characterization of both segments (A and B) is essential to understand the epidemiological behavior of this viral agent. utilizing the full genome for molecular epidemiology studies of IBDV would result in costly computational analyses, which would be also unfeasible [59] the structural domains in which B-marker is framed have a functional role in VP1 more than structural constrains. this region could be more influenced by evolutionary changes than possible negative selective restrictions. a novel IBDV natural reassortant was also analyzed. phylogenetic noise from fast-evolving sites misleads phylogenetic inference. the phylogenetic noise associated to the B-marker proposed was just around 4% less, in comparison with whole segment B. this result strongly supports the use of the region proposed as phylogenetic marker since a value less than 30.0% for phylogenetic noise is accepted as reliable in phylogenetic inference. vvIBDV and non-vvIBDV strains were classified for this segment of the viral genome. Previously classified vvIBDV strains were also classified as vvIBDV for segment B. this date matches the range of years proposed by tMRCA. conventional live IBDV vaccines based on classical virulent strains exhibit only poor efficacy against vvIBDVs [69]. vvIBDV strains with this new genetic background had the possibility to express the potential advantages of their large quasispecies cloud making expedite their establishment and spreading around the world. strain 117/96Pir was defined as a natural reassortant between segments A from vvIBDV and B from non-vvIBDV. the date of the emergence of this natural reassortant in Cuba was estimated to be 1994, after the introduction of vvIBDV strains to Cuba. pathogenicity and antigenicity of the strain 117/96Pir reassortant is unknown. strains could be useful to better understand the signatures and virulence factors for IBDV. the substitution rate for non-vvIBDV lineage was lower than vvIBDV lineage. a powerful assessment of a phylogenetic marker included into segment B of the genome of IBDV was performed. phylogenetically useful information from segment B in molecular epidemiology studies of IBDV. vvIBDV and non-vvIBDV strains in Cuban IBDV population were denoted. coalescent priors and clock models compared by PS, SS and AICM. the best model was highlighted in boldface."}
