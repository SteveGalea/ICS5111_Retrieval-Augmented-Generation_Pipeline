{"summary": "introduction toona sinensis Roemor (TS), also known as Cedrela sinensis, is widely distributed in the southeastern regions of Asia. it has been traditionally used as herbal medicine for as a febrifuge, astringent and carminative and as a treatment for enteritis [1]. it exerts pleiotropic biological functions such as a lypolytic effect on adipocytes [2], protective effects against hydrogen peroxide-induced methyl gallate, gallic acid, kaempferol, quercitrin, catechin, epicatechin, oleic acid, palmitic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, a mixture of -sitosterol and stigmasterol, and -sitosteryl-glucoside. human oral squamous cell carcinoma (HOSCC) accounts for 94% of all oral malignancies. human oral squamous cell carcinoma (HOSCC), UM1, UM2, and SCC-9 cells were treated with 500 g/mL of TSL-1 for various time periods. at the indicated time points, cells were harvested for viability assays, using trypan blue exclusion. apoptosis plays a critical role in responses to chemotherapeutic agents. results revealed that UM1 cell death was induced primarily by apoptosis (97%), whereas UM2, SCC-4, and SCC-9 cell death was induced by late apoptosis and/or necrosis. gallic acid is one of the major bioactive compounds in TSL-1 that is responsible for its anti-neoplastic activity. the presence of gallic acid in TS leaf extract exerts anti-tumor activity. gallic acid up-regulate pro-apoptotic genes and down-regulate anti-apoptotic genes. RT-PCR was performed for up-regulated genes such as TNF-, TP53BP2 and cIAP1 in UM-1 cells treated with TSL-1-5-7. the anti-proliferative effects of TSL-1 on HOSCC are due to apoptosis or a combination of apoptosis and necrosis. the mechanism for the apoptotic and/or necrotic cell death observed in UM2, SCC4, and SCC9 cells remains to be elucidated. upregulated TP53BP2 and GADD45A could induce apoptosis through the mitochondria death pathway [32,33], but the underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated. cIAP1 down-regulation suggests activation of caspase 9 [35,36], which leads to activation of caspase-3 and triggers tumor cell apoptosis of UM1 cells. intracellular gallic acid induces ROS, especially H2O2, which plays an important role in eliciting an early signal in apoptosis [24,39]. gallic acid has been shown to act synergistically with doxorubicin to suppress growth of DU145 cells [15]. NHOK cells were treated or untreated with 250 or 500 g/mL of TSL-1. at the indicated time points, cells were harvested for viability assays. apoptosis plays a critical role in responses to chemotherapeutic agents. UM1, UM2, SCC4, and SCC9 cells were grown in the absence (control) or the presence of TSL-1 (500 g/mL) for 24 hours, stained with annexin V and propidium iodide. 2.3. 3 4,5-Trihydroxybenzoic acid (gallic acid) is a major bioactive component of TSL-1 Induced HOSCC cell death indicates that TSL-1 contains bioactive compound(s) exerting anti-t the results revealed that the IC50 values of gallic acid and TSL-1-5-7 for 24 hours in UM1 cells were comparable (26.13 g/mL in TSL-1-5-7 vs. 19.47 g/mL in gallic acid) gallic acid is one of the major bioactive compounds in TSL-1 that is responsible for its anti-neoplastic activity. semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed for up-regulated genes such as TNF-, TP53BP2, and GADD45A. a similar up-regulated pattern of apoptotic associated genes by treatment of TSL-1-5-7 and gallic a acid are shown in Figure 5C and D. the mechanism for apoptotic and/or necrotic cell death observed in UM2, SCC4 and SCC9 cells remains to be elucidated. it is known that apoptotic pathways are deregulated in cancer [28] so induction of apoptotic and/or necrotic cell death in oral cancer cell lines by TS leaf extract shows promise as an antineoplastic therapy. cIAP1 down-regulation suggests activation of caspase 9 [35,36]. TS fraction TSL-1-5-7- and gallic acid-induced apoptosis was associated with up-regulation of pro-apoptotic genes and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic genes. gallic acid up-regulates Bcl2 and bax in gallic acid-treated HL-60 cells. oral administration of gallic acid was shown to suppress the growth of transplanted lung cancer by inducing tumor cell apoptosis in vivo. cisplatin was shown to significantly enhance the efficacy of cisplatin in inducing apoptosis in vivo. TSL-1-treated and control cells were harvested and resuspended in Hank\u2019s balanced salt solution and 0.4% trypan blue. assays for determination of 50% inhibition concentration (IC50) for proliferation of UM1 by TSL-1-5-7 and gallic acid for 24 hours were performed as described previously. initial denaturation for PCR occurred at 95 \u00b0C for 3 minutes. further cycles of denaturation, annealing, and elongation performed at 95 \u00b0C, 57 \u00b0C, and 72 \u00b0C, respectively, for 30 seconds. normal human oral keratinocytes were cultured in keratinocyte basal media. all media contained 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. trypan blue, hydrocortisone, and gallic acid were obtained from MP Biomedicals. -5-7 and gallic acid for 24 hours were performed as described previously [42] using Sigma plot 9.1. Flow cytometry analysis The Apoalert kit (Becton-Dickinson) was used to stain cells with annexin V-FITC and/or propidium iodide according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. a capillary GC column (60 m 0.26 mm ID 0.25 m film thickness) was interfaced directly with the mass spectrometer. the oven temperature was held at 50\u00b0C for three minutes and programmed to rise to 350 \u00b0C at increments of 20 \u00b0C/min."}
