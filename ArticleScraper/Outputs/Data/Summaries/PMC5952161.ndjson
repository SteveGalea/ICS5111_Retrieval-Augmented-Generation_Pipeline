{"summary": "enveloped viruses are enveloped viruses with single-stranded RNA genomes ranging in size from 26 to 32 kb. the entry of MHV is mediated by the interaction between the trimeric 180-kDa viral spike (S) protein and its cellular receptor, murine carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1a. s of MHVs are cleaved in the Golgi by furin-like enzymes to form the 90-kDa S1 and S2 subunits (8, 9) s1 contains the receptor binding domain (RBD) (10, 11), and S2 contains the membrane fusion machinery (8). additional cleavage(s) of S2 is required for virus entry (12\u201314) and is thought to release the restraint of the fusion peptide of the human 293T cells are not susceptible to infection with MHV-A59 virus or lentivirus pseudotyped with MHV-A59 S protein. large syncytia were formed when the cells were transfected with the plasmid encoding codon-optimized MHV-A59 S glycoprotein. the average size of syncytia in 293T cells and the percentage of nuclei in syncytia increased as purified lentivirus pseudovirions with MHV-A59 S protein were incubated under the indicated conditions for 30 min. they were digested on ice with 20 g/ml trypsin for 20 min. experiments were performed either without boiling and no DTT or with boiling and DTT. at 37\u00b0C, pH 8.0 had significant effects on the conformational changes of MHV-A59 S protein in the absence of the receptor (lanes 6 and 13), while pH 6.5 showed minimal effects (lanes 3 and 10) compared to the no-trypsin control. there was a new 60-kDa band in the sample without boiling and DTT treatment (lane 6). there are 15 histidine residues in the ectodomain of the MHV-A59 S protein. we first determined if any of the Ala mutations affected glycoprotein expression and processing in human 293T cells expressing wild-type (WT) MHV-A59 S protein. human 293T cells transiently expressing WT or His/Ala mutant S proteins were incubated with the soluble receptor mCEACAM1a[1-4] at 4\u00b0C. all of the mutant MHV-A59 S proteins that showed WT levels of expression and processing in cells also bound to soluble mCEACAM1a[1-4] at levels similar to that of WT S protein. the results from the wild type were set to 100%. all of the experiments shown were repeated at least three times. data are shown as means standard deviations. MHV S protein-expressing 293T cells transfected with pFR-Luc were incubated with 293T cells transfected with pBE-NF-B for 6 h with medium at either pH 6.5 or 8.0. the experiments were done at least three times, and means with standard deviation are shown. incubation of pBD-NF-B cells at pH 8.0 resulted in 300-fold increase in luciferase activity. the pattern of effect of individual Ala mutations on alkaline pH-triggered, receptor-independent cell-cell fusion was very similar to that of the nonquantitative method. luciferase activity increased by more than 10,000-fold compared to mock control. mutant S proteins were incorporated into pseudovirions as efficiently as the WT. mutant MHV-A59 is attenuated in cell culture. 209A mutation almost abolished pH 8.0-triggered receptor-independent fusion by MHV-A59 S proteins. the recombinant virus was propagated in murine 17Cl.1 cells. the mutation in the viral genome was verified by nucleotide sequencing. the 17Cl.1 cells were inoculated with either the WT or H209A mutant MHV-A59 virus at an MOI of 0.05. the S proteins were detected using polyclonal goat anti-MHV-S antibody AO4 at 24 h postinoculation. the nucleotide sequence at codon 209 was determined at each passage. at the initial inoculation ratio of 1 WT to 1 H209A, WT virus outgrew H209A virus in a single passage.

MHV-A59 S protein-expressing 293T cells were stained with goat anti-MHV S antibody AO4. the amount of wild-type S protein on the cell surface was set to 100%. all experiments shown were repeated at least three times. human 293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding different Ala mutant MHV-A59 S proteins. syncytium formation was pH dependent, since there was only a low background level of syncytia observed when cells were cultured in pH 8.0 medium. syncytium formation was pH dependent, since there was only a low background level of syncytia observed when S protein-expressing cells were cultured in pH MHV S protein-expressing 293T cells transfected with pFR-Luc were incubated with pBE-NF-B cells for 6 h with medium at either pH 6.5 or 8.0. the experiments were done at least three times, and means with standard deviation are shown. all mutant S proteins (H179A, H428A, H441A, H523A, H538A, H538A, H643A, H716A, and H760A) showed WT levels of expression and processing of S protein also induced receptor-independent cell-cell fusion at pH 8.0 at levels greater than or equal to 40% of the WT, except for H209A. H205A, H463A, H506A, H1098A, and H1114A likely caused reduced transduction because their S proteins were poorly incorporated into pseudovirions. a typical transduction by wild-type S proteins resulted in an increase of luciferase activity of over 10,000-fold. the timing of syncytium formation induced by infection of H209A virus was significantly delayed compared to that of WT virus. at 8 and 12 h postinoculation, release of H209A virus from the cells was 25-fold and 22-fold less than that for the WT virus. by 36 and 48 h postinoculation the yield of H209A virus was significantly greater than that of WT virus. WT or mutant viruses were inoculated on 17Cl.1 cells at an MOI of 0.05. virus-containing supernatant media were harvested at 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h postinoculation. all experiments were repeated at least three times. virus for 10 rounds and detected no revertant mutation. virus for 10 rounds and detected no revertant mutation. n is the nucleotide sequence analysis of residue 209 of mutant and wild-type MHV-A59 S glycoproteins from cocultured viruses serially passaged in murine 17Cl.1 cells. the letters in bold represent the coding sequence for residue 209 of S proteins. mutation A82V in the viral glycoprotein (Gp) may have contributed to the increasing rate of virus spread among humans. the results from infection at 0 h were set as 100%. the experiments were repeated four times. the results are reported as the percentage of transduction at 37\u00b0C. H179, H209, H441, H643, and H759 were critical for syncytium formation. 8 of 15 His residues in MHV-A59 S protein, including H441 and H759, are conserved in all of the MHV strains. Y68F mutant showed WT levels of RIS when triggered by pH 8.0. however, it is possible that pH 8.0 alters the local conformation of sheet 14. resulting in displacement of S1 from S2 and insertion of fusion peptide into target membrane. coV S protein in prefusion conformation is also metastable and can be triggered to undergo conformational changes by elevated temperature in the absence of receptor. the mutant was stable at higher temperature and for a longer time before inactivation. however, increased stability of S protein on virions by the H209A mutation apparently has a negative impact on its function. the relationship between viral glycoprotein stability and fitness has been studied extensively. the pH stability of influenza virus hemagglutinin has been linked to differences in host adaptation and transmission. the human isolates from more recently circulating pandemic H1N1 influenza viruses have evolved to increase their thermostability. murine 17Cl.1 (17Cl.1 line of BALB/c 3T3 fibroblasts) and Felis catus whole-fetus whole-fetus cells were maintained in modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2% penicillin-streptomycin-amphotericin B (Invitrogen) at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2.
