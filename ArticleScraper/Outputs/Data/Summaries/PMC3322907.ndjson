{"summary": "a probable case-patient was defined as a person who sought treatment after November 1, 2002, with a high fever (>38\u00b0C) and cough or breathing difficulty. a probable case-patient was excluded if an alternative reason could fully explain the illness. a probable case-patient was excluded if an alternative reason could fully explain the illness. a probable case-patient was defined as a person who sought treatment after November 1, 2002, with a high fever (>38\u00b0C) and cough or breathing difficulty and infiltrates shown on chest radiograph. a probable case-patient was excluded if an alternative reason could fully explain the illness. onset of illness was defined as the date when each case-patient first reported feeling unwell with symptoms compatible with SARS. data analysis data from the medical records were entered into Microsoft Excel and analyzed with Epi-Info version 6 software. signs Fever was present at admission for 79.0% of case-patients. 66.1% of cases-patients had fever >38\u00b0C. parameter range Mean Median Normal range Abnormal N Low High % Low % High Leukocytes (109/L) 2.7 16.3 5.9 5.3 4\u201310 19.4 6.5 62 Neutrophils (%) 44.0 92.8 70.7 71.0 40\u201375 - 37.1 62 Lymphocytes (%) 4.7 50.0 22.4 22.0 20-45 38.7 3.2 62 Lymphocyte count (109/L) 0.3 2.2 1.1 1.1 >1.5 79. we observed hyponatremia in 29.6% of patients on admission, and 14.8% of patients had hypokalemia. average maximum temperature for all cases was 38.7\u00b0C and reached a maximum of 39.0\u00b0C on day 5. the time from symptom onset to admission decreased during the outbreak. we observed that the time from symptom onset to admission decreased during the outbreak. more than one quarter of the patients had symptoms of the lower respiratory tract on admission; dry cough (22.6%), chest pain (24.2%), and dyspnea (19.4%). upper respiratory tract symptoms were reported infrequently. the radiographs of the remaining 15 case-patients showed abnormalities 2 to 7 days (median 5) from the admission date. Maximal radiographic changes during the illness were mainly bilateral interstitial infiltrates or bilateral alveolar opacities affecting less than two-thirds of the lungs. 0.273 0.468 0.388 0.386 0.40-0.52 25 1.7 60 Platelets ( 109/L) 53 293 160.7 158.0 150\u2013450 40.3 - 62 C-reactive protein (mg/L) 1 136 24.7 17.0 0-8 - 75 44 Alanine aminotransferase (UI/L) Hospital A Hospital B 8.0 13.0 36.0 294.0 22.3 70.0 22.0 49.0 10\u201350 40 3.4 34.5 12 Thrombocytopenia (platelet count 150 109/L) was present in the cohort from day 4 until day 9 of the illness. lymphocyte counts ranging from 1.0 to 1.5 109/L were present throughout the course of the illness. the average platelet count returned to within the normal range. piratory Therapy Respiratory assistance was required for 38 (61.2%) of the patients. 25 (40.3%) patients required the use of supplemental oxygen; 6 (9.7%) required positive pressure noninvasive ventilation. an additional 7 (11.3%) patients were intubated and received mechanical ventilation. the main feature exhibited by SARS case-patients on hospital admission was fever, which typically lasted 13\u201314 days after onset. thrombocytopenia, on average, lasted for 5 days, beginning on the fourth day after onset. thrombocytopenia, on average, lasted for 5 days. all probable SARS cases identified in the Vietnam outbreak were among healthcare workers or close contacts of case-patients. 98.4% had serologic evidence of SARS-CoV infection."}
