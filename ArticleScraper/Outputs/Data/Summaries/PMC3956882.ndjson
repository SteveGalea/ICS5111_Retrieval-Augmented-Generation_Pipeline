{"summary": "asthma is a disorder of the conducting airways that leads to variable airflow obstruction in association with airway hyperresponsiveness. it is characterized by inflammatory cell infiltration, mainly of eosinophils and lymphocytes, and reversible bronchoconstriction. as the disease becomes more severe, the airway acquire an altered repair response. transgenic expression of SOCS3 in T cells resulted in increased Th2 cell production, airway eosinophilia, and airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR) in a murine model of chronic asthma. the intranasal administration of naked siRNA has opened new possibilities in drug delivery and respiratory therapy. anti-mouse ROCK-2 was acquired from Sta Cruz Biotech. Flow cytometry antibodies (anti-mouse CD49d PE, CD3 PE, and CD19 FITC) were all purchased from BD (NY, USA) mice were sensitized on days 0 and 14 by intraperitoneal injection of 10 g OVA. a non-target siRNA scrambled duplex from Dharmacon was selected, synthesized, and annealed by the manufacturer. a total of 10 doses of siRNA were administered every 3 days. X-ray CT imaging was performed on a nanoPET/CT small-animal imaging system (Bioscan, Washington, DC) the mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylacine (100 mg/10 mg per kg of body weight) and positioned in a thermoregulated (38.7\u00b0C) mouse bed with an ophthalmic gel in their eyes to prevent retinal drying. the mice were anesthetised using an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine/xylazine (100 l per 10 g of animal) and positioned carefully in the FMT chamber with ophthalmic gel in their eyes to prevent retinal drying. the results were reconstructed and the region of interest (ROI) was defined within the chest area using TrueQuant 3D software to obtain quantifications. dilution (phospho-STAT3 1500, STAT3 11000, SOCS3 1500, RhoA 1500, ROCK-2 11000, -Actin 12000) RNA isolation, RT-PCR, and TaqMan gene expression assays Mice lungs were homogenized previously. RNA was measured by spectrophotometry, and 1 g of RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using a high-capacity cDNA Reverse Tran g of purified cRNA samples was submitted to the Gene Expression Department of Complutense University (Madrid, Spain) 16 samples were analyzed: 4 from the OVA group, 4 from the OVA siNT group, 4 from the OVA siSOCS3 group, and 4 from the SS group. the biotin-labeled cRNA samples were hybridized to GeneChip miRNA 3.0 Array (Affimetrix, CA, USA) according to manufacturer mice were assigned to 4 experimental groups: saline solution group (SS, n = 17), ovalbumin-sensitized non-target siRNA-treated group (OVA siNT, n = 16), and ovalbumin-sensitized non-target siRNA-treated group (OVA siSOCS3, n = 19) antibodies against phospho-STAT3 (Ser727), STAT3, SOCS3, and -actin were obtained from cell signaling siRNA sequences were selected, synthesized, and annealed by the manufacturer. a non-target siRNA scrambled duplex from Dharmacon was used. a total of 10 doses of siRNA were administered every 3 days. the optimal siRNA concentration selected was 2 M. the mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylacine (100 mg/10 mg per kg of body weight) a tail vein injection of 2 nmol of ProSense 680 agent (Perkin Elmer, MA, US) resuspended in 150 l of saline was performed in all mice at day 58, 4 hours after the final intranasal administration of OVA. the mice were anesthetised using an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine/xylazine (100 l per 10 g of animal) immunoblot Protein extracts from mice lungs were resolved on SDS-PAGE and probed with specific Abs at appropriate dilution. RNA isolation, RT-PCR, and TaqMan gene expression assay probes were performed on a 7500 Real-Time PCR system. messenger RNA was calculated for each sample using the cycle threshold (Ct) value. the relative gene expression was calculated as follows: 2-Ct, where Ct = C target geneC actin [16]. RNA quality control and miRNA microarray analysis Total RNA was isolated from the lungs using an RNeasy Mini Kit. gE and OVA-specific IgE, IgG1 and IgG2A at the time of sacrifice were collected by cardiac puncture. serum serum IgE, IgG1 and IgG2A were measured by ELISA. lane 2: lung lysate from the SS group; Lane 3: lung lysate from the OVA+siNT group; and lane 4: lung lysate from the OVA+siSOCS3 group. -actin was used as a loading control. -actin was used as a loading control. SOCS3 quantitative PCR was performed in liver and spleen from all mice. reduced inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness after SOCS3 silencing Airway function was assessed using whole body plethysmography 24 hours before sacrifice. 3D FMT quantification of pulmonary inflammation expressed as total pmoles per lung S.D (P0,01) of ProSense 680 fluorescence within the lung region of each mouse from all the study groups. there is an increase in density units in animal lungs from the OVA and OVA siNT-treated groups (478271 HU) the absolute number of BAL cells significantly decreased in comparison to the OVA group (11.87.1 105 cells versus 59.635.1 105 cells, P0.001). Flow cytometry was used to evaluate the percentage of different cell subpopulations in BAL. we did not find any significant changes in other leukocyte populations measured, such as neutrophils or lymphocytes T and B. untreated positive control (OVA, n = 12), non-target siRNA-treated (siNT, n = 12), and SOCS3 siRNA-treated (SOCS3-siRNA, n = 15) mice shown with H&E (row A\u2013D), PAS (row F\u2013I) and Masson Trichrome (row J\u2013M) staining of lung sections. increased collagen deposition is a hallmark of airway remodelling due to prolonged inflammation with chronic asthma. saline mice showed a thin uniform layer of matrix in the peribronchial subepithelial region. in chronic asthmatic mice we detected an increase in matrix thickness. siRNA NT 0.490.24 0.260.24 0.180.13 156.158.6 OVA + siRNA SOCS3 0.510.28 0.320.28 0.080.07 150.33.3 *Ig levels values represented (mean SD) for each group (12\u201317 mice/group) significant differences were obtained for IL-5 and IL-4 (P0.05) expression levels. for IL-13, IL-10, and IL-17A, significant differences were achieved only between the groups. we further corroborate IL-10 increased production after SOCS3 down-regulation in BAL fluids. pSTAT3 expression was measured against total STAT3 protein (A) and densitometric quantified (B) pSTAT3 expression was measured against total STAT3 protein (A) and densitometric quantified (B) band densitometries were performed to quantified protein of ROCK-2 (D) and RhoA (E) the comparison of OVA and OVA siNT versus the OVA siSOCS3 group shows a total of 25 miRNAs that are down-regulated in the siRNA SOCS3-treated group. 11 miRNAs were augmented due to the treatment. siRNA localization was determined by confocal microscopy. red fluorescence was localized in the lungs, predominantly in the peribronchial epithelial cells. SS group (mean SD, n = 13); oVA siNT-treated group (mean SD, n = 12); oVA siSOCS3-treated group (mean SD, n = 15); P0.001 and *P0.05 between groups. plot shows how SOCS3 gene expression was inhibited in the lungs of mice that received SOCS3-siRNA therapy. OVA and OVA siNT-treated mice developed a significantly enhanced response to methacholine when compared to saline animals. saline mice showed significantly inhibitory responses to cholinergic stimulation with different methacholine doses (6, 12, and 24 mg/ml) there is an increase in density units in animal lungs from the OVA and OVA siNT-treated groups (478271 HU) in mice treated with SOCS3-siRNA, a 2.7-fold reduction in HU was obtained (178.7560.813 HU), although these differences did not reach statistical significance. Flow cytometry was used to evaluate the percentage of different cell subpopulations in BAL. treatment with SOCS3-siRNA altered the cellular profile, resulting in a significant reduction in eosinophils (a 41% decrease) in BAL fluid. representative photomicrographs of excised pulmonary tissue from the saline group are in the first column, the second column presents the OVA group, the third depicts the OVA group, and the SOCS3- siRNA group is represented in the fourth column. in chronic asthmatic mice we detected an increase in matrix thickness in the subepithelial layer of the airways as well as in the perivascular regions. matrix deposition was consistently abrogated in the same regions. effects of SOCS3 down-regulation on quantitative expression of cytokine genes in lungs. results indicated that Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-13, and IL-5) were increased in mice with chronic-induced asthma (P0.05, Figure 5 A, B, C) when compared with saline mice. a marked increase in IL-10 mRNA expression was achieved in mice with SOCS3 down-regulation. we further corroborate IL-10 increased production after SOCS3 down-regulation in BAL fluids. IL-17A mRNA levels were augmented in OVA mice and inhibited in SOCS3 siRNA-treated mice. pSTAT3 expression was measured against total STAT3 protein (A) and densitometric quantified (B) band densitometries were performed to quantified protein of ROCK-2 (D) and RhoA (E) list of significantly modulated miRNAs after SOCS3 siRNA therapy compared to the non-treated asthmatic groups (P0.05), and their respective fold induction (FI) the inhibition of airway alteration is measured as a reduction in cellular infiltration, globet cell hyperplasia, and matrix deposition. in our model of asthma SOCS3-siRNA treatment produce also a decreased expression in IL-5, IL-13, and IL-4. this indicates that the therapy directly regulates the Th2 differentiation rate. bronchial smooth muscle contractility is one of the causes of AHR. IL-13 as well as IL-4 increase bronchial smooth muscle contractility. eosinophils are a potential source of IL-17 within asthmatic airways. we have reduced STAT3 phosphorylation after SOCS3 silencing and elevated IL-10 production. this is probably due to we did not abrogate SOCS3 levels completely. we have used microarray analysis to determine miRNA expression profiles in chronic asthmatic mice after SOCS3-siRNA therapy. 2 of the miRNAs that appeared downregulated after the SOCS3-siRNA therapy (miR-146b and 126) have been previously involved in asthma disease [32], [33] it would be worthwhile to conduct further studies of the mechanisms involved in the regulation of those miRNAs and others we have found. mRNA and in turn, increased expression of IL17 levels in BAL fluids. the treatment with SOCS3 siRNA intranasal delivered in a chronic asthma mouse model leads to inhibited asthmatic responses. these results may hold therapeutic potential for asthma patients."}
