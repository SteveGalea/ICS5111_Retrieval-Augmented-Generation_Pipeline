{"summary": "the size of spherical virus ranges from ten nanometers to hundreds of nanometers in diameter. a virus consists of single- or double-stranded nucleic acid and a protein shell, called a capsid. some viruses also have an outer envelope composed of fatty materials (lipids) and proteins. bacteriophage-bacteria interactions are summarized to show how the bacteriophage conquers the barrier of cell walls in the prokaryotic cells to transport its genome into the host. the bacteriophage-bacteria interactions are also summarized to show how the bacteriophage conquers the barrier of cell walls in the prokaryotic cells to transport its genome into the host. no plasma membrane invaginations or cytoplasmic vesicles containing virions were detected. we excluded the possibility of virion internalization by means of viropexis. virions adhered to the plasma membrane of microvilli by viral spikes. virions first attached themselves to the surface of host cell, then their envelopes fused with the cell membrane, and the whole nucleocapsids entered the cell. the contours of the nucleocapsids were blurred after the virions lost their envelopes. nucleocapsids formed in the swollen RER. some ribosomes attached on the membrane of the VMMV. virions budded from the VMMV into the smooth vesicles. the structures of the Podoviridae phage epsilon 15 with its host salmonella anatum [23] and the marine podovirus with its host Prochlorococcus [24] suggest that phage binding to its outer membrane receptor triggers the opening of the tail hub. the inner core then exits from the capsid and forms a tube across the periplasm through which the DNA is transported. electron micrograph of the virulent lactococcal phage p2 shows the capsid (blue, top), the tail, formed of rings of the major tail protein hexamers (gold), the globular baseplate (gold, bottom) the baseplate is reconstructed by single particles analysis. the receptor-binding protein positions are identified by blue arrows or a blue dot. most enveloped viruses enter cells via penetration and endocytosis vesicles. the simplest is membrane fusion, where the virion membrane fuses with the cell membrane directly or through mediation by a specific receptor."}
