{"summary": "NSPC proliferation decreases and production of new neurons declines that could impair maintenance of the NSPC pool. NSPCs are controlled by a finely orchestrated series of signals that coordinate proliferation and differentiation into different neural cell types (neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes). NSPCs are driven into the appropriate lineage by tightly timed expression of developmental growth factors and cytokines in specific brain regions. disruption of either NSPC proliferation or differentiation can lead to profound neurodevelopmental disorders, including microcephaly (52). our goal in this review was to highlight common antiviral cytokines and chemokines that are expressed in neurotropic infections. we hope to elucidate potential therapeutic targets to prevent or limit neurological sequelae associated with viral infections. increased proliferation was observed 24 h after treatment. at 72 h there was a moderate increase in apoptosis of NSPCs (135) distinct signaling pathways appear to be responsible at each stage. treatment results in disparities in differentiation because of the subtype of TNFR (TNFR1 or TNFR2) and age/brain region of the NSPCs. no changes in differentiation are observed when TNF binds to TNFR1 in the same model. TNF increases neurogenesis of postnatal SVZ NSPCs activation of the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway in vitro. TNF treatment of human and rat fetal NSPCs enhances astrogliogenesis and reduces neurogenesis (62,69) interleukin-6 Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is expressed basally in the brain. inflammatory changes in IL-6 can have protective and deleterious effects. inflammatory changes in IL-6 can have protective and deleterious effects. et al. showed that IL-6 administration in postnatal and adult mice results in an initial increase in NSPC proliferation and neurogenesis. in utero exposure to IL-6 results in long-term changes in the NSPC pools of the offspring. IL-6 may play a protective role for NSPCs, particularly during certain viral infections. IL-1 reduces NSPC proliferation in most in vitro studies. but the proposed signaling mechanisms vary based upon dose and duration. studies by Guadagno et al. and Wang et al. suggested reduced NSPC proliferation is at least partially because of apoptosis. IL-1 induces differentiation of NSPCs into the glial lineage and/or restricts differentiation into the neuronal lineage in vitro. this is also supported by in vivo studies where inhibition or knockout of interleukin 1 receptor 1 inhibits the decrease in neurogenesis in models of WNV neuroinvasive disease (44) and acute stress (66). wellen et al. observed the upregulation of the antiviral genes Myxovirus 1 (Mx1) and viperin in mouse NSPCs following IFN treatment (133). the effect of IFN on NSPC proliferation and differentiation appears to be species dependent. IFN inhibits NSPC proliferation and restricts cell cycle progression through STAT1-dependent dephosphorylation of cyclin D1 and of the Rb. effect of IFN on neurogenesis is age dependent, with increased neurogenesis seen in adult NSPCs. activated CD8+ T cells release IFN that restricts growth of embryonic NSPCs and increases expression of astrocytic markers. IFN may disrupt or protect NSPCs depending upon the type of viral infection and the age of the NSPCs. NSPCs derived from neonatal rat striatum exhibit decreased neuronal differentiation in response to IFN. a potential explanation for these different outcomes in differentiation may be age-dependent regulation of STAT signaling in NSPCs. TNF reduces the number of granule NSPCs in the cerebellar external granule layer, suggesting that TNF may affect survival or proliferation during CNS infections. low concentrations of TNF induce proliferation of postnatal SVZ NSPCs in vitro. short exposure to TNF causes an initial increase in proliferation. in vivo administration of TNF to adult mice resulted in an increase in newly formed NSPCs in the SVZ at 24 h postadministration, followed by a reduction in NSPCs in the SVZ at 48 h. the authors attribute this decrease to either apoptosis of the NSPCs or migration of NSPCs to the site of injection. acute TNF treatment results in increased proliferation through NF-B signaling. TNF also leads to the release of LIF that activates STAT3 signaling through LIFR. Iosif et al. observed that TNF binding to TNFR2 leads to an increase in neurogenesis in adult rat dentate gyrus. TNF also induces neurogenesis in the postnatal SVZ NSPCs, although it binds to TNFR1 (73). IL-6 administration in postnatal and adult mice results in an initial increase in NSPC proliferation and neurogenesis. in utero exposure to IL-6 results in long-term changes in the NSPC pools of the offspring. IL-6 may play a protective role for NSPCs, particularly during certain viral infections. IL-1 family contains 11 cytokines including the proinflammatory interleukin 1 beta (IL-1) (89) IL-1 is often seen in models of CNS viral infection including WNV, CMV, HSV, and HIV (4,28,74,95,99) IL-1 signaling has been implicated in control of both viral replication and immune cell recruitment and activation within the CNS. IL-1 induces differentiation of NSPCs into the glial lineage and/or restricts differentiation into the neuronal lineage in vitro. IL-1 activates the neurotoxic arm of the kynurenine pathway in differentiating NSPCs that reduce neurogenesis during IL-1 exposure. interferon beta Interferon beta (IFN) is a type I interferon that is secreted in response to viral infection, participates in the innate antiviral response, and induces interferon-stimulated genes that are key for viral control (105). IFN is induced in the CNS during many neurotropic infections, including WNV, La Crosse virus, HIV, and HSV-1. there is no effect on overall NSPC differentiation in human NSPCs. the sole study with human NSPCs generally used higher concentrations of IFN than those with mouse NSPCs (6,51,76,133) the effects of IFN on NSPC activity are species dependent. gamma (IFN) is a pluripotent cytokine that is required for control of many neurotropic viruses in the brain. IFN signals through activation of the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling pathway that also regulates proliferation and cell fate choice in NSPCs. in embryonic NSPCs, IFN restricts cell cycle progression through STAT1-dependent dephosphorylation of cyclin D1 and of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), thus blocking cell progression at a late-stage G1/S-phase transition. studies in cerebellar NSPCs show that IFN can enhance proliferation through the sonic hedgehog (Shh) protein (112) the inappropriate activation of STAT signaling by IFN could interrupt neurogenesis in the embryonic or neonatal CNS that could have long-term neurodevelopmental consequences on cortical growth or hippocampal structure. studies suggest that effects of IFN on NSPC differentiation are at least partially age dependent. CXCL10 treatment of a rat NSPC line induces extracellular regulate kinase (ERK)-1/2 phosphorylation. chronic CXCL10 exposure in neurons induces ERK-1/2 activation. ERK-1/2 signaling is generally neuroprotective and thus CXCL10 stimulation may protect NSPCs from apoptosis. there are not yet studies that investigate the effects of CCL2 on NSPCs in the context of viral infection. there are studies assessing the role of CCL2 on NSPC activity. CCL2 increases neurogenesis in adult NSPCs from the SVZ (123) in a murine model of MV infection, CXCL10 is the most highly induced cytokine in neonatal and adult brains (43). NSPCs express the CXCR3 receptor and follow a CXCL10 gradient in vitro, suggesting that NSPCs may use CXCL10 to home regions of neuronal damage during CNS infection or injury (120,121). chemokine ligand 2 C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) is a chemokine expressed in the brain in inflammatory conditions (31,140), including viral infections such as MV, WNV, and neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus (11,43,71,82) there are studies assessing the role of CCL2 on NSPCs in the context of viral infection. a growing body of research demonstrates that NSPCs are responsive to cytokines and chemokines produced during viral infections. cytokines can have different effects on NSPC proliferation depending on the model. limiting proliferation of these cells could also limit viral replication. function, particularly in the developing brain, may provide a foundation for future therapeutics."}
