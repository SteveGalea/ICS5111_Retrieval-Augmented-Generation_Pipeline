{"summary": "ipilimumab is a fully human anti-CTLA-4 antibody approved for the treatment of advanced melanoma. it is associated with some immune-related adverse events (irAEs) such as colitis (gastrointestinal irAE, or GI irAE) and skin rash. predictive biomarkers that can help identify patients more likely to develop these irAEs could enhance the management of these toxicities. ipilimumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that blocks cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) [1]. it is associated with a spectrum of irAEs which are immune mediated and called immune-related adverse events (irAEs) gene expression profiling was performed on whole blood samples from metastatic melanoma patients before and during ipilimumab treatment. a number of cell cycle- and immune-related genes were found to have higher expression at baseline and post-baseline in those patients who experienced GI irAEs. increased expression of neutrophil activation markers, CD177 and CEACAM1, were found to be associated with GI irAEs. treated patients with stage III (unresectable) or IV melanoma were randomized to receive open-label ipilimumab (10 mg/kg every 3 weeks for four doses) exclusion criteria included the use of any immuno-suppressing treatments including corticosteroids (patients on stable doses of hormone replacement therapy were exempt), cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept\u00ae), as well as chemotherapy and radiation. clinical activity (CA) was defined as confirmed complete response, confirmed partial response, or stable disease ending not earlier than 24 weeks from date of first ipilimumab dose. a complete description of irAE and CA evaluations for these trials has been reported elsewhere. 12518 of the 22215 non-control probe sets had maximum expression level of less than 32. gene expression data analyses GI irAE status was available for all 197 treated patients. 113 patients were classified in a no-GI irAE group. an uncorrected P value was used as a cutoff to select probe sets. expression of selected genes was confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) as described previously [10] using pre-designed probes. clinical activity was defined as confirmed complete response, confirmed partial response, or stable disease ending not earlier than 24 weeks from date of first ipilimumab dose. a complete description of irAE and CA evaluations for these trials has been reported elsewhere. RNA concentration was measured by nanoDrop spectrophotometer. RNA integrity was evaluated on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. complementary DNA preparation and hybridization followed manufacturer\u2019s protocols. baseline expression data were available for 108 and 49 patients. week 3 data were available for 108 and 47 patients. week 11 data were available for 78 and 30 patients. two selection criteria were applied: a P value 0.05 for the hypothesis test comparing the GI and No-GI irAE groups, and a minimum mean pre-treatment expression ratio of 1.5. for these tests, the P value threshold of 0.05 corresponded to an estimated FDR of 0.50. the 35 probe sets that exhibited the largest differential expression correspond to the neutrophil-specific marker, CD177, a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked cell surface molecule [23] there was no difference in baseline expression of CD177 between patients in the GI and No-GI irAE groups. expression of CD177 during ipilimumab treatment in patients who experienced grade 2+ GI irAE or did not (No-GI irAE) gene expression in patients showing clinical activity (CA) or not (No-CA) also plotted. numbers in circles describe the worst grade of GI irAE reported during the course of treatment. all seven patients with high levels of CD177 expression at week 3 had grade 2+ GI irAEs during the course of treatment. many patients with grade 2+ GI irAEs had a normalized expression level 8 for CD177 at week 3. this suggests low sensitivity of the biomarker in predicting GI irAEs. gene expression of CD177 was closely associated with the onset of GI irAEs. but early increases may also predict GI irAEs that could develop much later. this biomarker could not identify most future GI irAEs. we specifically searched for other neutrophil-associated genes. the pattern of mean gene expression of CEACAM1 over time was similar to that for CD177 (Figures 1A and 2B). expression of granule-associated genes. expression of genes with points above the central dashed line positively associated with CD177 expression. expression of genes with points above the central dashed line positively associated with CD177 expression. genes shown were selected from the top 50 genes having the most prominent mean differences in on-treatment expression between the two GI irAE and no-GI irAE groups. increases in expression of these genes over time were more prominent in the GI irAE groups than in the no-GI irAE group. ilimumab monotherapy at 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 4 doses. the mean fold change from baseline to week 3 and 11 was 4.3 and 12.0. expression changes similar to those seen in other studies were observed for CEACAM1 and most of the granule-associated genes. ipilimumab-associated GI irAEs occur after the second or third dose of ipilimumab. the 35 probe sets differentially expressed at week 3 are of particular interest. there was no difference in baseline expression of CD177 between patients in the GI and No-GI irAE groups. increase in mean expression of CD177 from baseline to week 3 was much greater in the GI irAE group than in the no-GI irAE group. expression levels of CD177 in these samples were confirmed by quantitative PCR, showing statistically significant differences between the GI irAE and no-GI irAE groups. numbers in the circles describe the worst grade of GI irAE reported during the course of treatment. highlights represent CD177 expression in the patient who experienced a fatal grade-4 GI irAE. PBANC increased gradually with ipilimumab treatment. out of 44 patients with grade 2+ GI irAEs who had matching gene expression data at week 3, 6 patients reported the first GI irAE before or on day 21 3 days (the nominal date of blood sample collection) the four highest values of CD177 expression were detected in patients who reported the first grade 2+ GI irAE between days 26 and 43 after receiving the first dose of ipilimumab. cathelicidin (CAMP), myeloperoxidase (MPO) [28], bactericidal/permeability increasing protein (BPI), defensin (DEFA4) [29], neutrophil elastase (ELANE) [30], cathepsin G (CTSG) [31], and CEACAM1. expression of CEACAM1 was significantly linearly correlated with that of CD177 at week 3 (r = 0.75, P = pathway analysis of changes in gene expression from baseline to week 11. the top biological processes that exhibited changes during ipilimumab treatment included pathways of cell proliferation and metabolism. the top biological processes that exhibited changes during treatment included pathways of cell proliferation and metabolism. related genes dominated both lists, including IGHA1, IGHA2, IGHG1 and IGHV4-31. increased expression of these genes over time were more prominent in the GI irAE groups than in the no-GI irAE group. no corresponding increase in B-cell marker genes (such as CD20) irAEs such as diarrhea and colitis are among the most common and sometimes severe forms of adverse events associated with ipilimumab. however, identification of predictive biomarkers is important as it may enhance the management of these toxicities and improve patient care. IL32 is selectively expressed by activated cytotoxic T and natural killer (NK) cells [37], potentiates the effect of IL-2 and IL-18 and activates the innate immune system to secrete chemotactic factors such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-), CXCL2 (11), and IL-8. a direct effect of IL-8 on the activation of neutrophils, the expression of adhesion molecules in the neutrophil cell membrane seven patients with the highest expression levels of CD177 at week 3 were those who already had or would experience GI irAEs within a few days to three weeks after that time point. ipilimumab monotherapy trial was one of the earlier trials, where these guidelines were not fully in place. the apparent association between neutrophil count, CD177 gene expression, and ipilimumab-associated GI irAEs led us to search for other neutrophil-associated genes in the microarray data. most of these genes were included in a neutrophil module reported by Chaussabel et al. [33] but there was no statistically significant linear correlation between their expression and that of CD177. earliest post-baseline blood samples were collected 3 weeks after first dose of ipilimumab. major changes in gene expression occurred within this time period. this suggests that the proliferation of neutrophils occurs after activation event. ipilimumab was found to induce antibody responses to selected enteric flora. however, no strong association between a positive level of antibodies toward these specific bacteria and GI irAEs was observed. in patients experiencing GI irAEs, the immunoglobulin production machinery had been turned on. irAEs: Immune-related adverse events; GI irAEs: Gastrointestinal irAE; ANOVA: Analysis of variance; CD177: Cluster of differentiation 177; CEACAM1: Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1; FDA: Food and Drug Administration; APBNC: Absolute peripheral blood neutrophil counts; N: Number; RMA: Robust multi-array analysis; CA: Clinical activity; CA: Clinical activity MJK assisted in data analysis and interpretation. VF, SDC, ZT, RJ performed the data analysis and interpretation. all authors read and approved the final manuscript. positive values give mean of (post-baseline expression)/(baseline expression); negative values give negative mean of (baseline expression)/(post-baseline expression). P value for the test of a difference in mean expression between the two GI irAE groups also is shown. GI irAE groups for granule-associated genes show a difference in mean expression. positive values give (mean expression in the GI irAE group) negative values give negative of (mean expression in the no-GI irAE group) negative values give negative of (mean expression in the GI irAE group)"}
