{"summary": "reconstructed outbreaks have been used to identify drivers of ongoing infection [1], characterize heterogeneous infectiousness in a population [2], evaluate the effectiveness of interventions [3] and determine transmission mechanisms [4]. reconstructed outbreaks have been used to identify drivers of ongoing infection [1], characterize heterogeneous infectiousness in a population [2], evaluate the effectiveness of interventions [3] and determine transmission mechanisms. genetic diversity across most outbreaks is low and a significant portion of genetic sequences expected to be identical [17], most prominently if the pathogen genome is small (e.g. human influenza [18]), the mutation rate low (e.g. mycobacterium tuberculosis [19]) or the generation time short (e.g. Streptococcus pneumoniae [20]) in these cases, transmission pairs cannot be accurately identified by genetic data alone, resulting in an overall poorly resolved contact data provided most of the information used to reconstruct transmission chains during SARS [25], Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) [26] and Ebola [1,27,28] epidemics. contact data can be classified as \u2018exposure\u2019 data and \u2018contact tracing\u2019 data. tracing data describes contacts between confirmed cases and individuals they could have infected. simulated outbreaks of two pathogens with well-defined epidemiological and evolutionary parameters, namely EBOV and SARS-CoV [27,32]. contrasting outbreak settings where the added value of incorporating contact data may vary. outbreaks were simulated using empirical estimates of the generation time distribution, the incubation period distribution and the basic reproduction number R0. transmission tree reconstruction was essentially impossible using only times of sampling. on average only 9% and 10% of infectors correctly identified in consensus transmission tree for EBOV and SARs-CoV outbreaks. a value of 0 indicates complete posterior support for a given ancestry. contacts were reported, and decreased with the number of non-infectious contacts, as these reduced the proportion of contacts informative of transmission events. the accuracy in reconstructing EBOV outbreaks increased from 9% to 44% when adding this data to the purely temporal outbreaker model. the color of a grid point represents the difference between accuracy of outbreak reconstruction using times of sampling and contact tracing data. incorporating contact data with 80% coverage and 2 non-infectious contacts per person led to an increase in average accuracy of outbreak reconstruction from 28% to 79% for EBOV outbreaks. transmission tree from these data either reconstructed probable lineages by manual inspection [35,36], or entirely discarded information on the six reported contacts between cases [6,37], even though they were all thought to be epidemiologically significant [36]. we analyzed the outbreak several times using different settings; with and without contact data and using different priors on. the outbreak was reconstructed using temporal, contact and genetic data. the non-infectious contact probability fixed at a value of 1e-4. however, not all ancestries supported by contact data received significant posterior support. sin847 remained the consensus ancestor of sin848 with 78% posterior support. the resulting posterior ancestries were identical to those inferred in the absence of contact data. the posterior distribution of transmission networks therefore spanned the contact network, with 6 of the 12 ancestries remaining fixed. this rigid topology of plausible transmission networks resulted in low variance among the remaining ancestries, producing basically a single posterior tree. outbreaks were simulated under strong super-spreading tendencies. a small number of individuals account for a high number of cases. the probability of a contact being reported is described by, the contact reporting coverage. a value of 0 indicates complete posterior support for a given ancestry. a value of 0 indicates complete posterior support for a given ancestry. a higher value indicates lower statistical confidence. however, this data was insufficient for complete outbreak reconstruction under our genetic likelihood. more than half of ancestries remained incorrectly assigned, but outbreaks were in fact reconstructed with greater accuracy than when using WGS from Ebola cases. contact data with only 40% coverage and 4 non-infectious contacts per person was as informative as fully sampled genetic data. 80% coverage and 2 non-infectious contacts per person lead to an increase in average accuracy of outbreak reconstruction from 28% to 79% for EBOV outbreaks. contact data therefore contained significant additional information on likely transmission routes not available from pathogen WGS. contact data significantly changed the posterior distribution of ancestries. the most likely infector of cases sin2677 and sin2774 was sin2500. the original transmission pathway inferred in the absence of genetic data also remained plausible. sin848 infecting sin852 resulted in an earlier inferred infection time for sin848, which in turn made it a plausible infector of sin847. a similar change in the inferred infection times of sin2500 and sin2748, driven by the contact data, reversed the directionality of their consensus infectious relationship. the posterior distribution of transmission networks spanned the contact network, with 6 of the 12 ancestries remaining fixed. this rigid topology of plausible transmission networks resulted in low variance among the remaining ancestries. this analysis proposed several new ancestries rejected with a value of 1e-4 and had a substantially lower average log-likelihood (-647.4 compared to -579.2) incomplete contact tracing data may be more informative than fully sampled, error-free genetic sequence data of some pathogens. however, they assume complete sampling of contacts and cases, and automatically designate confirmed cases with a known contact as transmission pairs. this is equivalent to fixing at a value of 0 in our model, which is unsuitable for integrating other types of data in a meaningful manner. our approach is therefore applicable to a wider range of realistic outbreak settings. incorporating this contact model alongside a temporal and genetic model represents an improvement over previous, ad-hoc methods to data integration. if most contacts are expected to have been reported, the prior on the contact reporting coverage can be shifted to provide greater support for higher values. contact tracing is a logistical challenge, as most if not at all infected individuals must be followed up. the coverage of contact tracing efforts conducted in low resource settings may therefore be low [47], and consequently poorly informative of the transmission network. the current model generally inferred directionality successfully from temporal data simulated under realistic delay distributions. the assumption of fixed generation time and incubation period distributions is therefore suitable for the use cases of our contact model [10,13,51]. the work presented here provides a simple yet flexible methodology for integrating contact data with genetic and temporal data in the inference of transmission trees. the work is an extension of the outbreaker model developed by Jombart et al. [16], re-written in a manner to be more extensible. the number of generations separating i and i is explicitly modelled and denoted i (i 1). the proportion of cases that have been sampled is defined by the parameter. the other estimated parameter is the mutation rate, measured per site per generation of infection. this calculates the probability of d(si,sj) mutation events occurring at the observed nucleotide positions and no mutations occurring at the remaining positions, while summing over the i generations in which the mutations could have occurred. temporal likelihood describes the probability of observing the time of symptom onset and proposed time of infection. NB is the probability mass function of the negative binomial distribution. the model considers undated, undirected, binary contact data. the contact status ci,j is set to 1 if contact is reported between individuals i and j and set to 0 otherwise. this model allows us to define a contact likelihood 4. describing the probability of observing the contact data C (a symmetrical, binary, NxN adjacency matrix with zeros on its diagonal) the prior on ancestries p() is uniform, and the prior on the mutation rate exponentially distributed. the prior on ancestries p() is uniform, and the prior on the mutation rate exponentially distributed. the prior on the mutation rate represents probabilities and are assigned Beta distributed priors with user-defined parameters. distributions and incubation period distributions were described by discretized gamma distributions, generated using the function DiscrSI from the R package EpiEstim [54]. each grid point, 100 outbreaks were simulated, with a single initial infection in a susceptible population of 200 individuals. the accuracy of outbreak reconstruction was defined as the proportion of correctly assigned ancestries in the consensus transmission tree. the uncertainty associated with an inferred ancestry was quantified using the Shannon entropy of the frequency of posterior infector for each case. assumptions on the temporal relationship between transmission pairs are given by the generation time distribution w, defined as the distribution of delays between infection of a primary and secondary case. the incubation period distribution f, defined as the distribution of intervals between infection and symptom onset of a case, is assumed to be known, and not estimated during the inference process. i is explicitly modelled and denoted i (i 1). the proportion of cases that have been sampled is defined by the parameter. the other estimated parameter is the mutation rate, measured per site per generation of infection. the temporal likelihood describes the probability of observing the time of symptom onset and proposed time of infection. the reporting likelihood describes the probability of unobserved intermediate cases: i 3 = p ( i | ) and is calculated as: N B ( 1 | i 1, ) where NB is the probability mass function of the negative binomial distribution. transmission pairs and non-transmission pairs experience contact with probability. this formulation accounts for the possibility of transmission occurring without direct contact. contacts that have occurred are reported with probability, the false positive reporting rate. p ( c i, j = 1 | i = j, i = 1 ) = p ( c i, j = 1 | i j ) = p ( c i, j = 1 | i j ) = p ( c i, j = 1 | i j ) = p ( c i, j = 1 | i j ) = p ( c i transmission trees and genetic sequence evolution were simulated using the simOutbreak function from the R package outbreaker. to describe heterogeneities in infectiousness within a population, we assumed Ri to be Gamma distributed with a mean of R0 and a dispersion parameter k. the resulting offspring distribution is a negative binomial [2] the first 60 ancestries of each outbreak were reconstructed four times using the R package outbreaker2 using combinations of times of symptom onset (T), contact data (C) and WGS (G): T, TC, TG, TG and TCG. a total of 6 contacts were reported in an outbreak of 13 cases. the proportion of contacts reported was believed to be about 50%. the prior on was therefore chosen as Beta(5, 5) solid lines represent reported contacts; green lines correspond to transmission pairs. red lines to non-transmission pairs; red lines to incorrectly inferred ancestries. accuracy of outbreak reconstruction was 46%. the density plots represent the mean posterior estimates of and across 100 reconstructed outbreaks. the colour of the plot represents the data used during the inference process, namely temporal and contact data only (TC), or temporal, contact and genetic data (TCG). the true, simulated value is indicated by a vertical dashed line."}
