{"summary": "virus-induced syncytium formation is a common cytopathic effect associated with replication of numerous enveloped viruses in the families Paramyxoviridae, Herpesviridae, and Retroviridae. syncytium formation is caused by viral membrane fusion proteins that evolved to mediate virus-cell membrane fusion during virus entry. protein-mediated cell-cell membrane fusion followed by syncytium formation is a multistage process. reovirus fusion-associated small transmembrane (FAST) proteins are nonstructural viral proteins that evolved specifically to induce cell-cell, rather than virus-cell, membrane fusion. at 95 to 198 residues in size, the FAST proteins are the smallest known viral fusogens. the rudimentary size of the FAST protein ectodomains is incompatible with a membrane fusion reaction based on energy released from dramatic ectodomain structural remodeling. the disproportionate size of their endodomains suggests that FAST proteins may be more reliant on interactions on the cytosolic side of the plasma membrane than enveloped-virus fusogens. intracellular AX1 interacts with p14 in a Ca2+-dependent manner. it promotes postfusion, pore expansion stage of syncytium formation. this is the first demonstration that intracellular AX1 is involved in pore expansion. polyclonal anti-protein disulfide isomerase (PDI; Abcam), polyclonal anti-green fluorescent protein (GFP; Clonetech), horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibodies were from the suppliers indicated here. the average number of syncytial nuclei per microscopic field was quantified. HT1080 cells in 12-well plates were transfected with 25 nM siRNA and 2.5 l of DharmaFECT1 in Opti-MEM. for siRNA transfection, HT1080 cells were cotransfected with EGFP-tagged AX1 and mCherry-tagged p14. NFRET signals were normalized to the square root of the product of the donor and acceptor. the distribution with the highest calculated R2 value was used to determine mean NFRET (mNFRET) values and average pixel amplitudes. the percent cofluorescent cells signifying transfer of soluble contents was determined using cell Quest and FCS Express, version 3, software from triplicate samples. transfected cells were treated with 20 to 100 M BAPTA-AM [1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester] for 30 min at 37\u00b0C, washed with HBSS, and incubated in growth HEK cells in 10-cm dishes cotransfected with FLAG-tagged AX1 and p14 or measles H and F plasmid constructs were harvested by scraping at 12 to 16 h posttransfection. a 10-l aliquot of a 50% slurry of washed Dynabeads (Invitrogen) was added to each sample and incubated at 4\u00b0C with agitation for 30 min. cells were fixed at 12 to 14 h posttransfection, and syncytium formation was quantified. antibody inhibition of differentiating C2C12 cells was as described previously. cells were incubated for an additional 16 h before syncytium formation was quantified. polyclonal rabbit anti-HER2 antibody was obtained from Graham Dellaire (Dalhousie University) p14 was tagged at the C terminus with mCherry. RRV p14 was tagged at the C terminus with mCherry. HT1080 cells in 12-well plates were transfected with 25 nM siRNA and 2.5 l of DharmaFECT1 in Opti-MEM. plasmid DNA was then transfected at 24 to 36 h post-siRNA transfection. three images were acquired from 10 cells in duplicate experiments. RET signals were normalized to the square root of the product of the donor and acceptor fluorescence intensities to control for variations in fluorophore expression levels. the distribution with the highest calculated R2 value was used to determine mean NFRET (mNFRET) values and average pixel amplitudes from each condition. cells signifying transfer of soluble contents were determined using cell Quest and FCS Express, version 3, software from triplicate samples. transfected cells were treated with 20 to 100 M BAPTA-AM [1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester] (Invitrogen) in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C, washe HEK cells in 10-cm dishes cotransfected with FLAG-tagged AX1 and p14 or measles H and F plasmid constructs were harvested by scraping at 12 to 16 h posttransfection. pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 137 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% NP-40, protea cells were fixed at 12 to 14 h posttransfection, and syncytium formation was quantified. antibody inhibition of differentiating C2C12 cells was as described previously (32). nonfusogenic p14G2A construct displays normal surface localization levels (31) was quantified by flow cytometry following immunostaining of nonpermeabilized cells using anti-p14 antiserum. p14 plasma membrane localization was quantified by flow cytometry following immunostaining of nonpermeabilized cells using p14 antiserum. fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) was employed to determine whether p14 interacts with AX1 in cellulo. this approach detects in vivo protein-protein interactions that occur over distances of 5 to 10 nm (35) and was applied to HT1080 cells cotransfected with EGFP-tagged p14 and N-terminally mCherry-tagged AX1. positive controls included cells cotransfected with soluble EGFP and mCh both yeast two-hybrid results and FRET analysis indicated that p14 interacts with AX1. HT1080 cells were cotransfected with EGFP-tagged AX1 and mCherry-tagged p14. control images were obtained from cells expressing p14 as a positive FRET control for a known multimeric protein. coexpressing full-length p14 and N-terminally FLAG-tagged AX1 were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody followed by Western blotting using anti-p14 antiserum. anti-FLAG antibody did not precipitate p14 in the absence of FLAG-tagged AX1 and AX1 did not coprecipitate the integral membrane protein HER2. mM (lanes 1, 2, and 10 to 12), 100 M (lane 3), 50 M (lane 4), 25 M (lane 5), 10 M (lane 6), 1 M (lane 7), 0.5 M (lane 8) and Ca2+ at 100 M (lane 9), 50 M (lane 10), and 25 M (lane 11) were immunoprecipitated and analyzed by Western blotting. RRV p14 interacts with AX1 in a Ca2+-dependent manner, both in vitro and in cellulo. HT1080 cells cotransfected with EGFP-tagged AX1 and mCherry-tagged p14 were treated with 0, 20, or 40 M BAPTA-AM. p14-transfected QM5 cells were treated with a range of BAPTA-AM concentrations. the requirement for intracellular Ca2+ during p14-mediated syncytium formation was not cell type specific. p14-transfected HT1080 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of BAPTA-AM at 4 h posttransfection, fixed, and Giemsa stained at 8 h posttransfection. HT1080 cells were sequentially transfected with nontargeting control or AX1 siRNA followed by cotransfection with measles virus F and H proteins. chelation of intracellular Ca2+ using 50 to 100 M BAPTA-AM decreased F-mediated syncytium formation by 60%. HT1080 cells transfected with control or AX1 siRNA and cotransfected with measles virus F and H plasmid DNA were fixed and stained at the indicated times post-DNA transfection. the average number of syncytial nuclei per field was quantified. results are the mean standard deviation of a representative experiment in triplicate (n = 3). fected with control or AX1 siRNA were cotransfected at 36 h post-siRNA transfection with EGFP plasmid DNA. donor cells were overlaid with target HT1080 cells labeled with CellTrace calcein red-orange AM. cells were fixed at 8 h postaddition of target cells, and transfer of fluorescent markers was quantified. target HT1080 cells labeled with the soluble cytoplasmic fluor calcein red-orange AM were overseeded on donor cell monolayers at 6 h after plasmid transfection. donor and target cells were cocultured for another 6 h after plasmid transfection. antibody inhibition of extracellular AX1 does not inhibit syncytium formation. extracellular AX1 was inhibited using anti-AX1 antibody. blocking antibody was added to p14-transfected HT1080 cells at 2 h posttransfection. same concentration of antibody had no effect on p14-induced syncytiogenesis. HT1080 cells transfected with p14 were treated with a 1:50, 1:25, or 1:10 dilution of AX1 antibody at 2 h posttransfection, fixed and Giemsa stained at 14 h posttransfection, and imaged. results are mean standard error from n = 3 experiments. treatment of cells with AX1 siRNA decreased p14-mediated syncytium formation by 93%. Western blotting confirmed that AX1 expression was reduced by the pooled siRNAs. plasma membrane localization of nonfusogenic p14G2A construct was quantified by flow cytometry. HT1080 cells transfected with p14 siRNA and then cotransfected with plasmid DNA expressing fusion-incompetent p14G2A were surface stained at 24 h post-DNA transfection with p14 anti-ectodomain antiserum and Alexa 647-conjugated secondary antibody. HT1080 cells were cotransfected with soluble EGFP and mCherry-tagged p14. p14-AX1 FRET intensity was 50% of that obtained during p14 homomultimerization. both yeast two-hybrid results and FRET quantification indicated that p14 interacts with AX1. the box highlights the standard deviation of mNFRETs, the plus sign (+) is the mean mNFRET, the line is the median mNFRET, and the whiskers indicate minimum and maximum mNFRETs. RRV p14 interaction with AX1 and syncytium formation is calcium dependent. HEK cells cotransfected with FLAG-tagged AX1 and p14 were lysed at 14 h posttransfection in buffer containing the indicated concentrations of Mg2+ or Ca2+. cells were immunoprecipitated and analyzed by Western blotting (WB) using anti-p14 antiserum (lanes 1 to 9) or anti-HER2 antiserum (lanes 10 to 12) intracellular Ca2+ was sequestered using BAPTA-AM, a membrane-permeable Ca2+ chelator widely used in studies of intracellular Ca2+ release and neurotransmitter signaling. repeated the FRET assay in the presence of 0 to 40 M BAPTA-AM revealed a dose-dependent decrease in FRET signal with increasing concentrations of BAPTA-AM. RRV p14 interacts with AX1 in a Ca2+-dependent manner p14-transfected QM5 cells were treated with a range of BAPTA-AM concentrations. the requirement for intracellular Ca2+ during p14-mediated syncytium formation was not cell type specific. similar results were obtained using p14-transfected HT1080 cells. HT1080 cells were cotransfected with measles virus F and H proteins. the proteins contain slightly longer cytoplasmic tails than most enveloped-virus fusogens. HT1080 cells transfected with control or AX1 siRNA were cotransfected with measles virus F and H plasmid DNA at 36 h post-siRNA transfection. the average number of syncytial nuclei per field was quantified. results are the mean standard deviation of a representative experiment in triplicate (n = 3). sates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody. sates were immunoblotted using anti-FLAG (AX1), anti-F, or anti-H antibody. measles virus F and H proteins were substituted for RRV p14. syncytium formation mediated by RRV p14 and measles virus F and H proteins. HT1080 cells labeled with soluble cytoplasmic fluor calcein red-orange AM were overseeded on donor cell monolayers at 6 h after plasmid transfection. p14 induced robust pore formation in presence of both control and AX1 siRNAs. treatment of cell monolayers with 20 or 40 M BAPTA-AM had no effect on p14-induced pore formation. antibody inhibition of extracellular AX1 does not inhibit p14-mediated syncytium formation. extracellular AX1 was inhibited using anti-AX1 antibody. p14-mediated syncytium formation was insensitive to treatment of cells with extracellular anti-AX1 antibody. extracellular AX1 contributes to myotube formation, but it is not involved in RRV p14-mediated syncytiogenesis. HT1080 cells transfected with p14 were treated with a 1:50, 1:25, or 1:10 dilution of AX1 antibody at 2 h posttransfection, fixed and Gi a yeast two-hybrid approach, using p14 endodomain as bait, yielded AX1 as a genetic p14 interaction partner. p14-p14 interactions were verified in vitro by coimmunoprecipitation and in cellulo by FRET analysis. p14-p14 interactions were sensitive to physiological intracellular Ca2+ concentrations. annexin is a p14 fusion cofactor involved in postfusion pore expansion. results suggest p14 interacts directly with AX1 in a Ca2+-dependent manner. chelating intracellular Ca2+ inhibited both p14-AX1 interactions and syncytium formation. annexins are a diverse family of ca2+-dependent membrane-interacting proteins implicated in a remarkable range of cellular processes. the conserved, C-terminal core domain comprises four repeats arranged to form a curved disc shape. the nonconserved short N-terminal domain of annexins is thought to interact with the cytoplasm-facing concave surface of the core domain. AX2 and AX5 present in virions promote virus-cell attachment and infectivity of human papillomavirus (56), cytomegalovirus (57), enterovirus type 71 (58), hepatitis B virus (59), and HIV (60). intracellularly, AX2 promotes formation of hepatitis C virus replication complexes and assembly of infectious HIV virions. extracellular AX1 promotes prefusion or membrane merger stages of myoblast fusion. intracellular AX1 functions at postfusion, pore expansion stage of viral fusogen-induced syncytiogenesis. pore expansion is an ATP-dependent event that is impeded by cortical actin. measles virus- and p14-induced syncytium formation inhibited. intracellular Ca2+ is therefore an essential factor for measles virus- and p14-induced syncytium formation, promoting the pore expansion stage of syncytium formation. p14 activates endoplasmic reticulum store-operated Ca2+ channels. the FAST proteins are the smallest known membrane fusion proteins. they are the only viral fusogens that specifically evolved to induce cell-cell, rather than virus-cell, membrane fusion."}
