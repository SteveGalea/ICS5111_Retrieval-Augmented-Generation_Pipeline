{"summary": "the governance of nutrition is essential to addressing both undernutrition and obesity. but international and domestic actors have struggled in this area. nutrition governance has risen on donor agendas since 1989. nutrition governance has been linked to obesity, diet-related chronic disease and the nutritional transition. despite this need, basic questions about nutrition governance lack ready answers. the range of actors includes everything from individuals to the multinational food industry. i PubMed was chosen as the starting point because it is the world\u2019s largest database of health and medical literature. to identify publications on nutrition governance, a keyword search for \u2018nutrition governance\u2019 was conducted in the PubMed database. nutrition governance 98 89 JSTOR Broad coverage of books, newspapers and social science journals Nutrition in title or abstract; governance in full text 83 59 Citation review Could detect relevant papers not identified by keyword searches Review of titles and context of citations. the rise of governance was a partial retreat from that position. the proliferation of actors in global health also spurred calls for better governance because of the need for coordination and accountability. bola in west africa in 2014 have made visible the importance of functioning governance mechanisms in health. the world bank began collecting governance indicators every other year. since 2002, it has collected these data annually from 212 countries and territories. the advance of globalisation highlighted the need for supranational regulation and strengthened governance at all levels. in 1999, Lang argued that globalisation was undermining traditional governance of food because national authority was not capable to regulating multinational businesses. Against Child Hunger and undernutrition (REACH) to strengthen UN actions to fight hunger and malnutrition by coordinating actions within recipient countries. in 2009\u20132010, WHO launched the Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) movement to spur progress against undernutrition. national policies will emerge from a system of governance that firmly connects the needs of the poor to a politically responsive local government. the international community needs to identify and establish a new global governance structure that can provide greater accountability and participation for civil society and the private sector. the politics of food policy hinges both on government leadership and activism by civil society organisations. others used \u2018governance\u2019 as an organising category to identify coordination problems. some analysts have assessed the effect of governance through comparative and synthetic investigations. a broad review of health system barriers to antiretroviral therapy provision found that many authors cited governance problems, but the collective evidence was weak. despite vast influence of governance on the agriculture-nutrition impact, only six studies, just 4% of the sample, actually focused on governance. some authors defined nutrition governance using broad definitions. 'governance deals with how...conflicting interests are resolved' others invoked governance to discuss or analyse a limited subset of concepts. CN was founded in 1977 with the express purpose of coordinating UN actions against nutrition problems. a major stated reason for launching SUN in 2010 was to harmonise views, policies and actions across a broader set of stakeholders including countries and donors. study focuses on obesity, globalisation of food and nutrition. primary themes include the globalisation of food, the products and marketing of multinational corporations and individual lifestyle choices. the frameworks by Morris et al and Meja Acosta and Fanzo do not include participation or transparency among their central elements. this choice may reflect that the dominant historical problem in undernutrition is inadequate food. a full-text search of the framework article does not find a single mention of either \u2018cooperation\u2019 or \u2018coordination\u2019. authors focusing on obesity typically emphasised political or political economic issues. this division suggests that either analysts employ different definitions of governance or refer to \u2018governance\u2019 with reference to specific manifestations rather than underlying principles. lack of prioritisation disguises the interaction or possible causality between the elements. the starting point for a unified nutrition governance framework is a definition of governance itself. a simple and classic definition of politics was offered by Lasswell in the 1930s as who gets what, when and how. this refers to the underlying definition of politics as a distributive process. nutrition governance is the ability of institutions and other structures to uphold the principles of participation, responsiveness, and accountability in the realization of the right to food. these three primary principles are central to human rights law, appearing prominently in the international Covenant on economic, social and cultural rights. inadequate attention has been paid to the interaction of global, national and local levels. inadequate attention has been paid to the differences in capacity and context in strong states, weak stakes, humanitarian disasters or elsewhere, for example. national representation in global affairs is predominantly in non-health areas. this calls for supranational regulatory mechanisms to allow more participation. participation by citizens is weak in many cases. a major challenge lies in the contest for perception and opinion on food and related policies. the formal governance problems are subtle because they concern broad political economy issues that are hard to analyse and remain unknown to many people. these include tax policy, agricultural policies, inadequate government authority and regulatory capture and ineffectiveness. the emphasis on safety nets and social protection could be read as a move by donors to enhance democratic participation by the poor. governance has become a well-established subfield in global health, partly because many problems related to governance have become more obvious. globalisation highlighted the need for supranational regulation and strengthened governance at all levels. globalisation was undermining traditional governance of food because national authority was not capable to regulating multinational businesses or countering their marketing. real food prices rose quickly in the 2000s, peaking in 2008 and 2011, driven by depreciation in the dollar, diversion of some crops to biofuel use, oil price appreciation, export restrictions, demand surges, droughts and other factors. the disastrous humanitarian consequences of this increase, including conflict and instability, generated political motivation. nutrition governance is so crucial. first, it is essential to realise the right to food. second, it is needed to coordinate between the many sectors important to nutrition. and among the many agencies and entities operating domestically and internationally. the importance of nutrition governance is demonstrated by experiences and analyses in many national and local contexts. some of the largest are collective action problems. in india, the main governance problems have been deemed more significant than scientific or technical obstacles. a synthetic review of 58 controlled evaluations argued that \u2018nutrition is now recognised to be a governance issue\u2019. a comparison of water quality in Brazil, Ecuador and Malawi found that access to safe water could be improved if certain water governance challenges were addressed. a systematic review of health system barriers to antiretroviral therapy provision found that many authors cited governance problems, but the collective evidence was weak because individual cases included too little context to convey what this meant in detail. despite vast influence of governance on the agriculture-nutrition impact, only six studies, just 4%, actually focused on governance. 'governance deals with how...conflicting interests are resolved' and may be defined as 'the exercise of authority or management of resources through institutions, policies, traditions, cultures and societal norms' others invoked governance to discuss or analyse a limited subset of concepts. the same dynamic plays out in countries where poor distribution systems leave some areas vulnerable even as food is sufficient when measured at the national level. the same dynamic plays out within countries where poor distribution systems leave some areas vulnerable even as food is sufficient. et al developed a matrix of sectors and governance levels for thinking about some of these issues. the sectors ranged from primary production and food processing to distributions, marketing, retail and catering/food service. this can be considered a nutrition governance framework. a full-text search of the Sacks et al framework article does not find a single mention of either \u2018cooperation\u2019 or \u2018coordination\u2019. a division in uses of nutrition governance lies between those concerned with undernutrition and those focused on obesity. a unified framework for nutrition governance is desirable. a simple definition of politics was offered by Lasswell in the 1930s as who gets what, when and how. a simple definition of politics was offered by the 1930s as who gets what, when and how. the basis for my conceptualisation of governance is the social contract that underlies modern nations. based on the principle that citizens are the ultimate source of power and the ultimate conveyors of legitimacy. accountability recognises citizens as the source of state power. a consensus orientation, effectiveness and efficiency and equity and inclusiveness are all factors that citizens would reflect in their participation and their preferences for accountability. existing scholarship can be categorised in four areas, as shown in table 2 as a map of sample nutrition governance problems in undernutrition and obesity at the national and global levels. accountability is very weak for transnational corporate activities and foreign government policies related to food, such as in subsidy, tax and trade. accountability is very weak for transnational corporate activities and foreign government policies related to food. participation problem is not the ability to influence, but the contest for perception about foods, food companies and regulation. the contest for perception and opinion on food and related policies is subtle because they are hard to analyse and remain unknown to many. an important division of approaches and general meanings exists between those who have focused on undernutrition and those who have concentrated on obesity. the former group have stressed coordination problems and structural issues related to the general functioning of government and the low accountability of international actors. Advancing the state-citizen contract is central to all areas of development. the imperative to assess how aid affects governance applies to every donor-supported project. projects that bypass or weaken the social contract have been common in past."}
