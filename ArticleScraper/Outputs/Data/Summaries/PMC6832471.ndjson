{"summary": "human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) is one of the major lower respiratory tract pathogens in infants with consistent annual outbreaks. 90% of infants are infected at least once within the first two years of life. elderly patients and patients with chronic heart and lung conditions are also at risk of severe infection and subsequent disease. a feature of the Mononegavirales is that the RdRp is present in the virus particle to initiate viral mRNA transcription upon release of the RNP in the cytoplasm. the order of genes along the genome for HRSV from 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 is non-structural proteins 1 and 2 (NS1 and NS2), N, P, matrix (M), small hydrophobic (SH), glycoprotein (G), fusion (F), and L. HRSV down regulates the production and function of IFN [22] by inhibiting toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling and mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein. a reduced apoptosis and enhanced survival of the infected cells results from activation of the phosphoinositidide 3-kinase pathway by NS1 and NS2 [24]. a protective antibody response is associated with B-cell stimulating factors [19]. nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from HRSV-negative children of similar age (1\u20139 years-old, median age = 2.5, IQR = 2.5) no pathogens were detected in this group using the film Array. hep-2 cells were grown at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2 in DMEM. the apical side was washed prior to infection with 200 L serum free (SF)-DMEM (no additives) cultures were infected (on the apical side for ALI) by incubation for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C 5% CO2. virus inoculum was removed and the apical side was rinsed 4 times with SF-DMEM (no additives) proteomic grade trypsin (Sigma) was added at a protein: trypsin ratio of 50:1 and samples incubated at 37 \u00b0C overnight. samples were centrifuged at 12,000 g for 60 min (4 \u00b0C) to remove precipitated Rapigest. up to the top 10 most abundant isotope patterns with charge states +2 to +5 from the survey scan were selected with an isolation window of 2.0 Th. the maximum ion injection times for the survey scan and the MS/MS scans were 250 and 50 ms respectively. the maximum ion injection times for the survey scan and the MS/MS scans were 250 and 50 ms, respectively. RNA was extracted from clinical nasopharyngeal aspirate (in triplicate) by using a Qiagen RNeasy minikit. cDNA was synthesized from RNA via reverse transcription. samples were mixed with primer and fragmentation buffer, heated at 85 \u00b0C for 5 min, and placed on ice. samples were converted to cDNA and purified with ampure XP. quantity was determined by use of a Qubit DNA HS kit. HRSV genome selected 1 million alignments at random. we used the coverage option for QuasiRecomb. java XX:NewRatio 9 - Xms2G - Xmx10G - jar. nasopharyngeal aspirate sampling was carried out as per hospital guidelines. a catheter was inserted into the nose, directed posteriorly and towards the opening of the external ear, in order to reach the posterior pharynx. the catheter was then rinsed with a small volume of 0.9% saline solution. ALI cultures from each donor were infected with HRSV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1, using SF-DMEM (no additives)-treated cells as mock infection. just before infection, the apical side was washed twice with 200 L of virus stock diluted in SF-DMEM (no additives) beforehand. sample protein content and volume was normalized with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate. samples were heated at 80 \u00b0C for 10 min, reduced with 3 mM dithiothreitol. samples were then alkylated with 9 mM iodoacetimde (Sigma) at room temperature. the peptides were separated by a linear gradient of 3.8\u201350% buffer B over 90 min at a flow rate of 300 nL/min. the LC system was coupled to a Q-Exactive mass spectrometer (thermo Fisher Scientific) carbamidomethylation (cysteine) was set as a fixed modification and oxidation (methionine) set as variable modification. Mascot search results were further validated using the machine learning algorithm Percolator embedded within Mascot. samples were mixed with primer and fragmentation buffer, heated at 85 \u00b0C for 5 min, and placed on ice. samples were converted to cDNA and purified with Ampure XP. 1% PhiX174 was spiked into the sample on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 instrument. the sequence reads were mapped to the HRSV-A2 genome by using Bowtie2. for each alignment, the output BAM files were further analyzed using QuasiRecomb. LC-MS/MS was used to identify HRSV proteins in nasopharyngeal aspirate samples. nasopharyngeal aspirates should represent secretions from the respiratory epithelia. nasopharyngeal aspirates should represent secretions from the respiratory epithelia. the major identified viral proteins are consistent with the presence of virus particles in the nasopharyngeal aspirates rather than proteins from intracellular material. the major identified viral proteins are consistent with the presence of virus particles in the nasopharyngeal aspirates. axis with the virus genome and position of each genome is shown in logarithmic scale. the number of mapped reads was equivalent across the genome, apart from the termini. this would be consistent with the nasopharyngeal aspirates containing viral particles rather than intracellular material. logenetics can be used to compare viral genotypes between samples. mutations can also occur during virus replication leading to genome diversity within a particularly patient. Various selection pressures can act on the genome with time. virus isolated from nasopharyngeal aspirates, air liquid interface culture, and cell culture appeared to be greater frequency of variation. this would indicate that the ALI may recapitulate viral replication/selection observed in vivo. these hotspots of transition and transversion substitutions appear across the genome. the cut-off value was 0.5%, and the region of the genome shown is indicated by the bold numbers at the top. a highly variable region has been identified in the gene/protein. this may result in the antigenic variability of the virus. mass spectrometry followed by Progenesis analysis was used to identify and quantify cellular proteins. this clustered the changes in abundance of cellular proteins according to whether the samples came from uninfected or infected children. samples from infected children were then classified into categories of viral load; \u2018low\u2019 infection (ct score >25), medium (ct score 20\u201325), and high (ct score 20). nucleic acid-based detection systems were thought to be more sensitive than protein-based assays. LC-MS/MS was used to identify HRSV proteins in nasopharyngeal aspirates. nasopharyngeal aspirates should represent secretions from the respiratory epithelia. RNAseq was used to sequence the viral RNA present within the nasopharyngeal aspirates. RNAseq was used to sequence the viral RNA present within the nasopharyngeal aspirates. if viral mRNA was present, reads mapped to intergenic regions would have been predicted to be underrepresented. if viral mRNA was present, reads mapped to the intergenic regions would have been predicted to be underrepresented \u2013 which was not the case. data can be used to capture information on viral genome variation within a patient. any variant that reaches the 50% threshold then becomes part of the consensus genome sequence. this genome variation was compared to an HRSV A2 strain grown in air liquid interface culture. the ALI may recapitulate viral replication/selection observed in vivo. these hotspots of transition and transversion substitutions appear across the genome. the analysis was implemented using a 500-nucleotide sliding window across the HRSV genome. the data indicated differences in the minor variants between patients and between viral genomes within the same nasopharyngeal aspirate/patient. separately, distinct clusters of variants along the genome were observed \u2013 particularly in the glycoprotein coding region. nasopharyngeal aspirates sampled from infected children were classified into categories of viral load; \u2018low\u2019 infection (ct score >25), medium (ct score 20\u201325), and high (ct score 20). cellular proteins increased or decreased in abundance in the proteomes of the nasopharyngeal aspirates from infected children compared to control (non-HRSV) children. the difference between a nasal swab and nasopharyngeal aspirate is that a nasal swab is obtained by inserting a tip of a bulb into the nostril. a nasal swab is obtained by inserting a tip of a bulb into the nostril and a nasopharyngeal aspirate requires a suction device and samples more deeply. nasopharyngeal as RNAseq analysis of the nasopharyngeal aspirates also identified HRSV nucleic through de novo assembly. phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the virus present in the nasopharyngeal aspirates most closely mapped to sub-group A virus. previous work has shown that ribavirin, a therapeutic treatment for HRSV, can induce hypermutation along the genome (30) leading to error catastrophe. quantitative proteomic analysis also identified cellular proteins in the nasopharyngeal aspirates. the abundance of some of these proteins changed in abundance in samples taken from children infected with HRSV compared to HRSV-negative children. of interest was the identification of several proteins that increased in abundance in HRSV-infected children. nasopharyngeal aspirates from HRSV-infected children may identify other potential anti-viral molecules and proteins involved in controlling secretory pathway trafficking. these may provide targets for therapeutic intervention or potential biomarkers for point of care diagnostics to assess the severity of infection."}
