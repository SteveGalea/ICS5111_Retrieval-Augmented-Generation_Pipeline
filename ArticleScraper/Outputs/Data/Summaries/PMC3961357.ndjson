{"summary": "the de novo fatty acid biosynthesis pathway generates the long-chain fatty acid palmitate. palmitate contributes to several key biological functions such as protein palmitoylation and phospholipid synthesis. HCMV increases the activity of ACC as a means of upregulating phospholipid synthesis, thereby providing additional membranes for viral assembly [5]. the DV protein NS3 has been shown to actively relocalize FASN to sites of viral replication. gene expression, genome replication and maturation, virion morphogenesis and egress, and a range of interactions with the intrinsic, innate and adaptive defenses of the host. despite the virus' physical and genetic autonomy from the host nucleus, infection still requires macromolecule precursors such as nucleotides, phospholipids, and amino acids. a comprehensive metabolomic analysis of vaccinia-infected cells is lacking. fatty acid synthase inhibitor cerulenin inhibits viral yield. fatty acid synthase (FASN) inhibitor, cerulenin, inhibits viral yield. effects of two additional pharmacological inhibitors were assessed. a decrease in the accumulation of the viral late protein F18 and a decrease in the cleavage of the viral protein L4 were ameliorated by the addition of exogenous palmitate. the key role for palmitate during viral replication is not for post-translational modification of proteins or as a substrate for phospholipid synthesis Palmitate has several biological functions within the cell. BSC40 cells were infected with WT vaccinia virus (MOI 5) in the presence of various concentrations (0, 25, 50 and 75 M) of 2-bromopalmitate, a palmitate analogue and inhibitor of palmitoylation; viral yield at 16 hpi is shown (n = 6). triacsin C is a potent competitive inhibitor of long chain acyl-CoA synthetase. key contribution of palmitate during vaccinia infection might be its potential to undergo -oxidation and promote energy production. we tested the importance of glucose, which can be metabolized to pyruvate and ultimately acetyl-CoA, thereby driving the TCA cycle. etomoxir is an irreversible inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1) and prevents the import of long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria. treatment with etomoxir inhibited the 16 h viral yield 14-fold compared to treatment with DMSO. TMZ is a competitive inhibitor of 3-ketoacyl coenzyme A thiolase. inclusion of 2\u20138 mM TMZ led to a dose-dependent, but modest, decrease in the 16 h viral yield when cells were maintained in the presence of glucose. in the absence of glutamine, viral yield was reduced 1300-fold. the addition of 250 M or 500 M glutamine rescued viral yield by 20-fold and 384-fold, respectively. maximum virus production was restored at 1 mM glutamine. in the absence of glutamine, the addition of 15 mM oxaloacetate rescued viral yield. 5 mM dimethyl-ketoglutarate only rescued viral yield 4-fold. glutamine plays critical roles during infection, among which is anaplerotic support of the TCA cycle. the initial OCR (90 min post-infection) of infected cells was almost twice that of mock-infected cells at 75 pmol/min. this rate remained high throughout the infection, rising to 127 pmol/min at 12 hpi. this increase in OCR can be ascribed to mitochondrial rather than glycolytic activity. elevated OCR seen in infected cells was due to increased \u00df-oxidation of palmitate and TCA cycle-driven ATP production. etomoxir-treated cells were depressed at all times and decreased over the course of infection. mitochondrial import of long-chain fatty acids is key for sustained and elevated ATP production within infected cells. ining pattern largely colocalized with the Mitotracker signal. no anti-FASN staining was seen at 7 hpi with vaccinia virus. both FASN and mitochondria were more concentrated in perinuclear region. a single cell is shown at higher magnification in the bottom row. images show ablation of FASN staining when a blocking peptide was included. etomoxir and TOFA have the greatest impact on the post-replicative phase. BSC40 cells were infected with WT vaccinia virus (MOI 2) in presence of 25 g/ml BrdU to track nascent DNA synthesis. at 7 hpi, cells were fixed and stained with primary antisera recognizing the viral I3 protein (top row), a marker of DNA replication sites. BSC40 cells were infected with WT virus in the presence of DMSO, TOFA, C75 or etomoxir for 10 h. the DNA was resolved and visualized with ethidium bromide. similar results were seen when viral DNA replication was assayed by Southern dot blot analysis. protein synthesis in mock-infected cells was largely unaffected by inclusion of these inhibitors. in infected cells, we saw the expected reduction in host protein synthesis at both 4.5 and 7.5 hpi. overall protein synthesis was diminished to 35% of control levels in cells treated with TOFA and 65% in cells treated with either etomoxir. at 4.5 hpi, WT infected cells showed a characteristic decrease in host protein synthesis. at later time points, WT infected cells show the synthesis of late viral proteins (open circles, lanes 5\u201316) the presence of vehicle (DMSO), the inhibitor rifampicin (rif), was 40-fold greater than the yield from cells shifted under conditions in which virus production was inhibited. the inclusion of TOFA or C75 after the temperature shift was as deleterious to virus production as rifampicin. a significant block to virus production is seen in the presence of rif, TOFA or C75 (n = 6). to further examine the importance of fatty acid biosynthesis to viral assembly, we performed infections in the presence of rif. the reversible inhibitor rifampicin prevents the interaction of the viral proteins D13 and A17, thereby preventing the assembly of immature virions. cells released from rif block into DMSO produced 345-fold more virus than those maintained in rif (black bars) the addition of palmitate gave a significant but incomplete (7-fold) rescue of virus production in cells released from rif in the presence of C75 (gray bar) electron microscopic analysis was performed on cells infected in the presence of rif for 12 h. the addition of exogenous palmitate to C75 treated cells partially rescued the block observed in cells treated with C75 alone. the most dramatic impairment observed was the fragmentation of the virosomal contents into splotchy aggregates, and the inefficient incorporation of this material into nascent virion membranes. exogenous palmitate was added to infected cells treated with DMSO, TOFA, and C75. addition of palmitate had no impact on cells treated with DMSO. but rescued viral yield by 8-fold in cells treated with either TOFA or C75. BSC40 cells were incubated with [3H]-palmitate for 4 h in the presence of DMSO or 50 M 2-bromopalmitate. whole cell lysates were resolved and analyzed by fluorography. inhibition of palmitoylation or phospholipid synthesis has no impact on viral replication. BSC40 cells were infected with vaccinia virus in glucose-free media or media. they were stained with DMSO or 6.25 M triacsin C to monitor the inclusion of oleic acid into lipid droplets. this process requires acylation of oleic acid by acyl-CoA synthetase [19]\u2013[22]. one step growth analysis of BSC40 cells infected with WT vaccinia virus (MOI 5) in the presence (black diamonds) or absence (gray circles) of 4 mM glucose supplemented with DMSO (vehicle control) or etomoxir (360 M) (striped bars) treatment with etomoxir caused a much greater decrease in viral yield. when glucose was omitted, treatment with etomoxir caused a much greater decrease (125-fold) in viral yield than had been seen in glucose-containing media. these data show that import of long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria is important for viral infection. glutamine plays a critical role during infection that can be partially substituted by addition of TCA cycle intermediates. the process of glutaminolysis can provide TCA cycle intermediates through the deamination of glutamine to glutamate, which is imported into mitochondria and converted into -ketoglutarate. in absence of glutamine, viral yield was reduced 1300-fold. cells were infected with WT vaccinia virus (MOI 5) in a glutamine-free medium or media containing 200 M glutamine supplemented with 15 mM oxaloacetate or 5 mM dimethyl-ketoglutaric acid. the addition of 15 mM oxaloacetate was unable to rescue viral yield, and 5 mM dimethyl-ketoglutarate only rescued viral yield 4-fold. XF-96 extracellular flux analyzer measures oxygen consumption rates as a direct surrogate of ATP synthesis. this assay allows for repeated monitoring of ATP synthesis of a single sample over time. at 90 min post infection, mock treated cells had an oxygen consumption rate of 40 pmol/min, which rose to 75 pmol/min by 12 hpi. BSC40 cells were either mock infected (gray diamonds) or infected with WT vaccinia virus (MOI 5) in the presence of vehicle control (DMSO) or etomoxir (360 M) (gray circles) and OCR was measured from 1.5 to 12 hpi (n = 12) (***, p0.001). the most reproducible and distinct pattern was seen using a polyclonal antibody raised against a peptide from the C\u2032-terminus of FASN. in mock-infected cells, a tubular pattern of staining that radiated throughout the cytoplasm was seen. this pattern was reminiscent of mitochondrial staining. mock and virally infected BSC40 cells were fixed with cold methanolacetone (11) samples were stained with primary antiserum recognizing FASN and blocking peptide. a single cell is shown at higher magnification in the bottom row and corresponds to the cell outlined in the dotted box (fourth row) large sites of viral DNA replication accumulate in the cytoplasm as shown by the colocalization of I3 and DAPI. similar replication foci were observed in cells treated with either TOFA (middle column) or etomoxir. BSC40 cells were infected with WT vaccinia virus in the presence of DMSO, TOFA (154 M), C75 (39 M) or etomoxir (360 M) at 10 hpi, cells were processed for PFGE; DNA was visualized by ethidium bromide staining. the levels of full-length genomic DNA that accumulated were 50, 70 and 83% of that seen when cells were treated with vehicle (DMSO) alone. viral protein synthesis is modestly reduced in the presence of TOFA, C75 or etomoxir Vaccinia virus infection. each phase of transcription (early, intermediate, late) is mediated by proteins expressed in the prior phase. host mRNAs decrease in abundance and translation is skewed towards viral mRNAs. overall protein synthesis was diminished to 35% of control levels in cells treated with TOFA and 65% in cells treated with either C75 or etomoxir. the inhibition of palmitate synthesis leads to a modest reduction in the rate of protein synthesis. a temperature-sensitive mutant with a lesion in the F10 protein kinase (Cts28); at the non-permissive temperature (39.7\u00b0C) the virus has a well-characterized defect in virus assembly. this arrest is reversed when cells are shifted to permissive conditions to allow the resumption of assembly. at 12 hpi, cells were released from the rif block into media containing rif (100 g/ml), DMSO, TOFA (154 M) or C75 (39 M) at 12 hpi, cells were released from the rif block into media containing rif (100 g/ml), DMSO, TOFA (154 M) or C75 (39 M) the reversible inhibitor rifampicin prevents the interaction of the viral proteins D13 and A17, thereby preventing the assembly of immature virions. in the presence of rif, DNA replication and the full profile of protein expression proceed normally, but morphogenesis arrests at an early stage [35] in the presence of rif. cells were released into DMSO (upper right panel), the full range of assembly intermediates, including crescents (C), immature virions (IV) and mature virions (not shown) were seen. the smooth, dense viroplasm observed in rif synchronization was dispersed into splotches or aggregates. inhibition of any part in this pathway causes a significant diminution in viral yield. ATP generated by this pathway contributes to viral DNA replication and protein synthesis. glutamine is most important for the morphogenesis of infectious virions. inhibitors of this pathway are shown in red. impairment of each of the steps in this pathway significantly diminishes vaccinia virus production. ATP production supports DNA replication and protein synthesis (gray dashed lines) vaccinia virus is more dependent on -oxidation of fatty acids within the mitochondria than on glycolysis for maximum ATP production. vaccinia virus is more dependent on -oxidation of fatty acids within the mitochondria than on glycolysis for maximum ATP production. the levels of FASN are not upregulated during vaccinia infection. it will be of interest in the future to determine whether the specific activity of ACC or FASN is upregulated upon vaccinia infection. both enzymes are known to be modulated by phosphorylation, ubiquitination and by specific interactions with stimulatory and inhibitory binding partners. citrate to acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate by ATP citrate lyase. this pathway is used by highly proliferative cells that utilize citrate as an intermediate for lipogenic pathways. replenishment of the TCA cycle must occur through glutaminolysis and anaplerosis. glutamine is essential for vaccinia virus infection: depletion of glutamine reduces viral yield by 1300-fold. the progression of the viral life cycle through three temporally regulated stages of gene expression was not impaired in the presence of C75, TOFA, or etomoxir. the process of virion morphogenesis appears to be acutely sensitive to the impact of these drugs and the attendant decrease in ATP synthesis. when cells were released into C75, the expected burst of virus production was diminished by >10-fold. the de novo fatty acid biosynthesis pathway plays a key role in viral infection by generating sufficient palmitate for import into mitochondria. the subsequent \u00df-oxidation of palmitate can drive the TCA cycle and augment the production of ATP. this pathway offers a novel target for developing therapeutics to treat poxvirus infections. labeled protein molecular weight markers and Mitotracker Red CMXRos were purchased from GE Healthcare Life Sciences. 5-(Tetradecyloxy)-2-furoic acid (TOFA) and triacsin C were obtained from Enzo Life Sciences.
