{"summary": "small volant and nonvolant mammals are among the most common agents for infections. black rats are considered likely agents for the spread of Oriental rat fleas. more recent examples of small mammal zoonoses include severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by a coronavirus and Ebola hemorrhagic fever caused by Ebolavirus. both Apodemus and Rattus have complex evolutionary and taxonomic histories. switching between valid species and synonyms causes considerable confusion. many species occur only in remote mountains or near national borders with high species diversity. the former species occurs in western Europe (Bousbouras, 1999; Machol\u00e1n et al., 2001; Mezhzherin & Zykov, 1991; Michaux et al., 1996). incorrect identification in china likely relates to outdated taxonomy. 147 specimens of Apodemus and 233 specimens of Rattus were examined. external and skull measurements followed Liu et al. (2012). all specimens were identified by the same researcher (SYL) for consistency. we finally assigned our specimens to nine species of Apodemus, seven species of Rattus, and a new subspecies of Rattus nitidus. the product was purified using an EZNATM Gel Extraction Kit (Omega, USA) it was sequenced using the same primers for amplification on an ABI 3730XL sequencer. the software blasted each sequence against the GenBank nucleotide collection (nr/nt) database. spp. (n=3) and a mitogenome of Bandicota indica were selected as outgroup representatives for Apodemus and Rattus. the datasets included 572 (with seven mitogenomes) and 397 sequences (15 mitogenomes), respectively. we aligned the sequences for each genus using MAFFT v7.3 implemented in Geneious v11. 147 specimens of Apodemus and 233 specimens of Rattus were collected from multiple localities across china. external and skull measurements followed Liu et al. (2012). we analyzed morphometric variation using log10-transformed variables. the first dataset included both external and craniomandibular variables. the second dataset included craniomandibular variables only. sequences were assembled and edited using the same primers for amplification on an ABI 3730XL sequencer. the software blasted each sequence against the GenBank nucleotide collection (nr/nt) database. the datasets for Apodemus and Rattus included 572 (with seven mitogenomes) and 397 sequences (15 mitogenomes), respectively. we aligned the sequences for each genus using MAFFT v7.3 implemented in Geneious v11. we only used rRNAs and 13 protein-coding genes for phylogenetic analyses. the first and second principal components accounted for 57.6% (eigenvalue=6.9; Table 2, a) and 11.7% (eigenvalue=1.4) of total variation, respectively, with all other principal components having eigenvalues smaller than 1. apodemus latronum plotted on the positive regions of PC1 and PC2. i and A. latronum plotted on the positive regions of PC1 in accordance with its small skull.

MG748165\u2013MG748348. the smallest distance occurred between A. uralensis and A. pallipes. the distances for Rattus ranged from 2.1% to 16.5%. clade of R. nitidus had two subclades, one from southern Xizang. some specimens were also associated with R. losea, R. nitidus, R. rattus, and R. tanezumi. representative animals from china fell into nine clades that corresponded to nine species. Apodemus draco, A. ilex, and A. semotus fell together in a well-supported clade (BS=100) but the relationships among the three species were not resolved. the tree depicted GenBank sequences deposited under different names within a shallow clade, most commonly with R. andamanensis. some specimens were also associated with R. losea, R. nitidus, R. tanezumi and R. nitidus from southern Xizang. our carefully identified specimens of A. pallipes were from southern Xizang (Pulan County) the average cyt b genetic distance between A. pallipes and A. pallipes was 5.4%, which was the smallest interspecific genetic distance in Apodemus. however, as we had no access to these specimens, it was not possible to determine whether they matched the morphological description of A. pallipes. endemic species of Taiwan was characterized by a dark gray pelage rather than the reddish-brown color of all other Asian species of Apodemus. we recognize all three as full species to better reflect their long evolutionary histories and distinct distribution patterns. future comprehensive morphological diagnosis is desirable. the Xizang specimens differed from R. nitidus, including the cusp t3 being present, gray-white underbelly, and larger measurements. the molecular phylogeny also placed the Xizang specimens and R. nitidus in different clades. Apodemus chevrieri, A. draco, and A. latronum co-occur in western Sichuan. only one sequence of A. peninsulae in GenBank was likely misidentified. confusion appears to be due to out-of-date taxonomy rather than misidentification. a new subspecies of R. nitidus thibetanus subsp. nov Holotype: Adult female, collected by Liao Rui on 15 January 2011. the specimen was prepared as a skin with cleaned skull and deposited in the Sichuan Academy of Forestry. weight: 179.6 g; HBL: 205 mm; TL: 200 mm; HFL: 40 mm; SGL: 45.49 mm; SBL: 43.00 mm; MB: 17.06 mm; ABL: 8.08 mm; NBL: 19.00 mm. cusp t3 present on M1 in first transverse loop, but very small. tail length usually larger than head plus body length; belly gray-white. transition between darker dorsal and lighter ventral pelage relatively abrupt. t3 of first dental loop present in Rattus nitidus thibetanus subsp. nov compared with other subspecies. t-test showed significant differences in UTRL, UMRL, ML, and TL between R. n. nitidus and R. n. nitidus. previously, Rattus was recovered as a paraphyletic genus. the differences between A. pallipes and A. uralensis were discussed in depth. Johnson & Jones (1955) described A. chejuensis. Koh (1991) also recognized the species based on its large body size. corbet (1978) assigned it as a synonym of A. agrarius ningpoensis. Feng et al. (1986) identified a series of specimens of R. pyctoris from Xizang. the species closely resembled R. rattus but with a pale underbelly, relatively long nasal bone, and cusp t3 on M1. phylogenetic analysis associated the species with R. nitidus. the earliest Chinese specimen of R. rattus (black type) was collected by A. B. Howell from Kuliang, Fukien in 1929 (Allen, 1940) in 1955 and 1956, the Fujian Epidemic Prevention Station collected specimens from Fujian. Species of Apodemus were easier to identify than Rattus. confusion between A. draco and A. ilex appears to be due to out-of-date taxonomy rather than misidentification. most species of Rattus are invasive in china and have experienced strong selection resulting in morphological modification to adapt to local habitat. tronum, A. pallipes, A. peninsulae, A. semotus, and A. uralensis occur in china. future comprehensive and integrative analyses can determine if further splitting is necessary and/or desirable. the new subspecies is recorded from Yadong, Motuo, Nielamu, and Jilong counties, southern Xizang, China. the name is derived from the type locality, southern Xizang (Tibet), China. t3 of the first dental loop present in Rattus nitidus thibetanus subsp. nov (vs. t3) absent or just vestigial; belly gray-white, transition between darker dorsal and lighter ventral pelage relatively abrupt in Rattus nitidus thibetanus subsp. nov. the independent sample t-test showed significant differences in UTRL, UMRL, ML, and TL between R. n. nitidus and R. n. thibetanus. the K2P distance for R. n. thibetanus was 0.019, smaller than the smallest interspecies distance known in Rattus. the new subspecies is recorded from Yadong, Motuo, Nielamu, and Jilong counties, southern Xizang, China. the name is derived from the type locality, southern Xizang (Tibet), China. subspecies of Rattus nitidus Upper incisors medium in size vertically downward and orange. t3 of first dental loop present in Rattus nitidus thibetanus subsp. nov. the independent sample t-test showed significant differences in UTRL, UMRL, ML, and TL between R. n. nitidus and R. n. thibetanus. the K2P distance for R. n. thibetanus and R. n. nitidus was 0.019."}
