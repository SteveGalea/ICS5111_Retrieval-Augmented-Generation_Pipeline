{"summary": "a set of primers suitable for CPA detection of PEDV were designated by CPR-2, DF5B1, DF5F-12, F3-1, and B3-1. gel electrophoresis results below the strip graph confirmed the CPA reaction corresponding to the results on the strip. optimization of CPA assay included concentration optimizations of external primers, probe and cross primer. optimal concentrations were 0.3 L and 0.6L for 20 M DF5F-12 and 20 M DF5B1 respectively. final volumes of dNTP (10 mM), MgSO4 (50 mM), betaine (5 M) and Bst DNA polymerase were 0.8, 0.4, 6, and 1 L. the optimal concentration of each reagent was as follows: CPR-2 (20 M), 0.4 M; F3-1, 0.1 M; B3-1(20 M), 0.2 M; DF5F(20 M), 0.3 M; DF5B(20 M), 0.6 M; MgSO4, 2 mM; betaine (5 M), 1.5 M; dNTP(10 mM), 0.8 L; and 1 Bst DNA polymerase buffer. results showed that 106 diluted plasmid could be detected consistently by CPA-NATS. however, results with 107 diluted plasmid were inconsistent. 106 was considered the detection limit of CPA-NATS. pathogens used to detect specificity of RT-NATS and RT-PCR were CSFV, PRRSV, PCV, TGEV, and PEDV. the detection limit was 106 dilution. the products size is about 150 bp. the number of PEDV-positive samples detected by RT CPA-NATS was 2 of 20 in Chengdu, 3 of 11 in Harbin, and 5 of 10 in Jinan (Table 3). however, two samples (one from Chengdu and one from Jinan) were detected positive by RT-PCR but negative by RT-PCR but negative by RT-PCR.

Sensitivity and specificity of reverse transcription cross-priming amplification and nucleic acid test strip (RT-PCR) system. results showed that 106 diluted plasmid could be detected consistently by CPA-NATS. however, results with 107 diluted plasmid were inconsistent. the detection limit was 106 dilution. Lane 2Lane 8: PEDV, CSFV, PRRSV, PCV, TGEV, and PRV. samples 1\u201320 were obtained from Chengdu, 21\u201331 from Harbin, and 32\u201341 from Jinan. 7 samples (Nos 5, 13, 21, 22, 23, 32, 35, 35, 36, 37, and 38) were tested PEDV positive by RT-PCR. six fecal swab specimens from sick piglets were collected and tested for PEDV. two of the six specimens (2# and 3#) were tested positive. a real-time reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) method was reported to be easy to operate and simple to read results. but RT-LAMP detects pathogens using reaction-turbidity as an indicator, which is sometimes difficult to determine without an instrument. the test strip result of CPA-NATS offers direct visualization by eyes, and is much easier to be interpreted. RT-PCR15, RT-LAMP and real time RT-PCR16 were all compared with in virus detection. the system was incapable of discriminating variants and virulent strains of PEDV. however, it offers an excellent tool for initial screening of clinical specimens. the primers N-F/R were used to amplify the PEDV N gene fragment. the amplicon was cloned into pMD18-T vector by TA cloning at site 425. the concentration of T-PEDV-N was 241.5 g/mL. the genome was extracted with the E.A.N.A.TM Viral RNA Kit (OMIGA, Norcross, GA) or E.A.N.A.TM Viral DNA Kit (OMIGA, Norcross, GA) the viruses were detected by the reverse transcription CPA-NATS (RT) system. nonprofessional personnel in a livestock farm conducted the RT CPA-NATS to detect PEDV in the samples. the same samples were tested using their developed RT-PCR method with the detection primers D-800-F/R. the product length was 800 bp. g/mL, with approximately 5.39 1013 copies/mL, with approximately 5.39 1013 copies/mL. the initial test system was as follows: CPR(20 M), 0.8 L; F3(20 M), 0.2 L; B3(20 M), 0.2 L; DF5F(20 M), 0.3 L; DF5B(20 M), 0.3 L; DF5B(20 M), 0.3 L; DF5B(20 M), 0.3 the virus were detected by the reverse transcription CPA-NATS (RT CPA-NATS) system. a system including RT and CPA was optimized to detect PEDV RNA from clinical specimens. cross-Priming Amplification\u2013Nucleic Acid Test Strip for Rapid Detection of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus. doi: 10.1038/srep24702 (2016)."}
