{"summary": "SIN kinase Sid2 phosphorylates cytokinetic formin Cdc12. intriguingly, Cdc12-HA3 migrated more slowly during nuclear division just prior to septation. similar gel mobility patterns were observed for Cdc12 tagged with a different epitope. anti-HA immunoprecipitates of samples were subjected to either phosphatase treatment or a buffer control before being resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted. CDK was used as a loading control. anti-Flag immunoprecipitates of the samples were subjected to either phosphatase treatment or a buffer control before being resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted. asterisks denote a noncollapsible species; CDK was used as a loading control. cdc12-4A-Flag3 was not hyperphosphorylated to the same extent as wild-type Cdc12-Flag3 during a cps1-191 cytokinesis arrest. wild-type Cdc12-GFP3 localizes only to the CR. cdc12-4A-GFP3 formed spots that were not restricted to interphase but persisted throughout cell division. wild-type Cdc12-GFP3 was also detected at SPBs during cytokinesis. intriguingly, wild-type Cdc12-GFP3 was also detected at SPBs. cdc12-4A cells treated with 20 M 3-MB-PP1 or untreated exhibited severe negative genetic interactions. loss of sid2-mediated Cdc12 phosphorylation alters formin targeting and compromises the robust performance of the cytokinetic actomyosin machinery. cdc12-4A mid1 cells were significantly more defective in cytokinesis than either individual mutant. cdc12-4A mid1 cells were significantly more defective in cytokinesis than either individual mutant. cdc12-4A was synthetically sick with a clp1-6A-GFP allele. blue-stained cdc16-116 cdc12-V53 and cdc16-116 cdc12-4A-V53 cells after 4 h at the restrictive temperature. cells were initially synchronized by centrifugal elutriation and then shifted for 4 h to the restrictive temperature. n > 300 for each time point. cdc12-V53 cells septated almost immediately, and nearly all mononucleates developed multiple septa within 4 h. cdc12-4A-V53 mutants also contained medial spots, but not rings, of actin and CR proteins IQGAP YFP-Rng2 and Cdc15-GFP. cdc16-116 cdc12-4A-V53 cells that slipped into mitosis completed medial septation cps1-191 cells form CRs, but these mutants require SIN activity. intact F-actin rings were not observed in cps1-191 cdc12-4A arrested cells. cdc12-GFP3 maintained a ring structure during a cps1-191 arrest. 3 formed similar spot-like structures in a cps1-191 arrest. cdc12 does not maintain a CR but collapses into a spot during a cytokinesis arrest. arrows indicate actin CRs whereas an arrowhead points to a medial actin mass. cdc12-4A cells formed CRs that later collapsed and clustered into a medial mass during the arrest. so, sid2-mediated phosphorylation is required for SIN-dependent CR maintenance. to identify such a domain, we introduced C-terminal tags at the endogenous cdc12+ locus to produce serial 100-residue truncations. residues 1451\u20131538 comprise a functional domain. this fragment overlaps with the region contributing to CR formation. residues 1451\u20131538 comprise a functional domain. in vitro binding of recombinant His6-Cdc12(1451\u20131538) with bead-bound Cdc12-Flag3 or Cdc12-4A-Flag3 immunoprecipitated from a cytokinesis arrest. samples were washed, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and coomassie blue-stained. one-fifth of the input is given as a control. cdc12(1451\u20131538) overexpression in cells did not immediately affect SIN activation. overexpression of this domain was less toxic in a cdc121451\u20131538 mutant lacking these residues endogenously. residues 1451\u20131538 function as an oligomerized region. two sid2-directed phosphosites were within or near the Cdc12 oligomerization domain (Fig. 5A) and Cdc12 clustered during cytokinesis upon loss of this phosphorylation. phosphorylation by Sid2-Myc13 significantly abrogated the self-interaction. cdc12 oligomerization domain facilitates linear F-actin bundling. loss of the Cdc12 C terminus compromised CR formation. oligomerization may be important earlier during cytokinesis. low-speed sedimentation assay of MBP-Cdc12C (C) or MBP (M) with F-actin (A) equal portions of supernatants (s) and pellets (p) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and then Coomassie blue-stained. the oligomerization domain contains the oligomerization domain. it lacks the FH1FH2 region copelleted with F-actin in high-speed sedimentation assays. this binding event revealed a KD of 670 nM (Fig. 6D) similar to those described for other F-actin bundlers at the CR. we quantified condensed and noncondensed CRs in mitotic cdc25\u201322 cells at permissive temperature. a quarter of cdc121451\u20131538 binucleates possessed medial actin that had yet to condense into a ring. a sid2-based reversal of multimerization subsequently limits this activity. -Phosphatase treatment of Cdc12-V53 immunoprecipitates from cytokinesis-arrested cells. block and release of cdc25-22 cdc12-HA3 cells. at indicated time points, cell cycle progression was monitored. anti-V5 immunoprecipitates were subjected to either phosphatase treatment or a buffer control before being resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted. CDK was used as a loading control. SIN induction achieved via inactivation of the inhibitory GAP Cdc16 (Minet et al. 1979) resulted in Cdc12-V53 hyperphosphorylation. kinase Sid2 localizes to SPBs and the CR during a cps1-191 cytokinesis arrest. wild-type Cdc12-GFP3 localizes only to the CR during cytokinesis. cdc12-4A-GFP3 formed spots that were not restricted to interphase. CR-localized Cdc12-4A-GFP3 appeared more punctate and discontinuous. live-cell bright-field/GFP/RFP merged image of asynchronous cdc12-4A-GFP3 sid4-RFP cells. arrows indicate Cdc12 interphase spots, and green arrowheads indicate SPB localization. cdc12-4A mid1 cells were significantly more defective in cytokinesis than either individual mutant. loss of sid2-mediated phosphorylation alters formin targeting and compromises robust performance of the cytokinetic actomyosin machinery. cdc12-4A was synthetically sick with a cdc15 temperature-sensitive allele (Supplemental Fig. 3F), which eliminates SIN-dependent Clp1 phosphorylation. these results are consistent with Sid2-mediated Cdc12 phosphorylation representing an important facet of downstream SIN-based CR regulation. dc16-116 cdc12-4A-V53 and cdc16-116 cdc12-4A-V53 cells septated after 4 h at the restrictive temperature. a majority of cdc12-4A-V53 mononucleates failed to septate within this time frame. cdc12-4A-V53 mutants also contained medial spots, but not rings, of actin and CR proteins IQGAP YFP-Rng2 and Cdc15-GFP. cdc16-116 cdc12-V53 cells that slipped into mitosis completed medial septation (Fig. 3B; Supplemental Fig. 3K), consistent with the cdc12-4A allele eliminating a key SIN signal intact F-actin rings were not observed in cps1-191 cdc12-4A arrested cells as they were in cps1-191 sid2-250 cells. cps1-191 cdc12-4A cells often contained medial F-actin clumps flanking \u201ckissing nuclei\u201d that had returned to cell middles following failed cytokinesis. 1 cdc12-GFP3, cps1-191 cdc12-4A-GFP3 and cps1-191 sid2-250 cdc12-GFP3 cells shifted for 3 h to 36\u00b0C. images were acquired every 5 min. Bars, 5 m. predicted spot-like structures observed in cdc12-4A mutant originated from CRs collapsing during the cytokinesis arrest. endogenous cdc12 truncations lacking residues C-terminal to Cdc12's FH2 domain were viable. despite comparable viability, these mutants differed in CR phenotypes. overexpressing the Cdc12 C terminus strongly inhibited cytokinesis. live-cell bright-field, GFP, mCherry/RFP, and merged fluorescence images of cdc15-mCherry sid4-RFP cells. some of the cells overexpress GFP-cdc12(1451\u20131538) from the pSGP572a plasmid. cipitations were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-PSTAIR (CDK) in vitro binding of bead-bound recombinant MBP or MBP-Cdc12(1451\u20131538), which had been phosphorylated by Sid2-Myc13. an empty anti-Myc13 immunoprecipitate was used as a control in kinase reactions. overexpression drove endogenous Cdc12-GFP3 into spot-like structures. overexpressed GFP-cdc12(1451\u20131538) was detectable in clusters at separated SPBs. residues 1451\u20131538 function as an oligomerization domain, which influences Cdc12 clustering. phosphorylation by Sid2-Myc13 significantly abrogated the self-interaction. alanine mutation of S1523 in cdc12(1451\u20131538) created a stronger dominant-negative that hastened cytokinesis defects upon overexpression. oligomerization domain facilitates linear F-actin bundling. pombe CR investigated the possibility that Cdc12 multimerization contributes to F-actin bundling. the Cdc12 C terminus bundles F-actin partly via its oligomerization domain. high-speed (150,000g) sedimentations were performed with varying F-actin concentrations. cdc25-22 cdc121451\u20131538 lifeAct-GFP cells were grown at 25\u00b0C. images were acquired every 1.5 min, and representative images are shown. three trials, with n > 100, were performed per genotype. the oligomerization domain supports the organization of F-actin into linear bundles in vitro. a cdc12C1451\u20131538 mutant fragment that lacks the oligomerization domain (Supplemental Fig. 6B) bound F-actin with higher affinity than the intact C terminus (Supplemental Fig. 6C,D), this mutant did not bundle F-actin but instead formed disordered cross-links. cytokinetic formin Cdc12 is a direct sid2 target that is key to cytokinesis. sid2-based reversal of multimerization subsequently limits this activity. cytokinetic formin Cdc12 appears to function as an oligomeric switch. cdc12+ cells maintain a CR during a cytokinesis arrest and undergo septation in interphase when the SIN is prematurely activated. however, when the SIN kinase Sid2 cannot phosphorylate Cdc12, Cdc12 and other CR proteins cluster abnormally, similar to when Cdc12's oligomerization domain is overexpressed. cdc12 clusters can expand with time if relevant disassembly cues are not triggered. the self-association domain is hyperabundant (Yonetani et al. 2008; Coffman et al. 2009); the Cdc12 C terminus possesses an inhibitory domain (Yonetani and Chang 2010). despite mid1-based compensation at the CR, Cdc12-4A still accumulates at SPBs during CR constriction. this is consistent with a multimer disassembly defect and other data suggesting an SPB\u2013Cdc12-binding interface. node condensation and mature CR formation require F-actin bundling. node-localized Cdc12 is ideally positioned for this task. this activity may be particularly useful for incorporating nonmedial F-actin cables into the CR. the separation of Cdc12's F-actin bundling and FH1FH2 domains likely allows for temporal control of nucleating and bundling activities and precludes competition between them. cdc12+, cdc12-4A, cdc121451\u20131538, cdc12 truncations, rpn11+, and sid2+ were tagged endogenously at the 3\u2032 end. nda3-KM311 cells were arrested in prometaphase by shifting cultures for 6.5 h to 18\u00b0C. cps1-191 cells were arrested in cytokinesis by shifting cultures for 3 h to 36\u00b0C. cells were cooled immediately to 25\u00b0C on ice and then grown at 25\u00b0C. dc12-4A and cdc121451\u20131538 constructs were then cut from the vectors and transformed into wild-type S. pombe cells using a lithium acetate method. either DMSO or DMSO containing Lat A was added to log-phase cultures. the final Lat A concentration was 0.2 M. anti-HA (12CA5), anti-Myc (9E10), anti-V5 (Invitrogen), anti-Flag (M2, Sigma) or anti-Cdc2 (Sigma) were used in immunoprecipitations and/or as primary antibodies in immunoblotting. secondary antibodies were conjugated to IRDye680LT or IRDye800 (LI-COR Biosciences) in vitro kinase assays were performed using the sid2\u2013Mob1 kinase complex immunoprecipitated from SIN-activated sid2-Myc13 cdc16-116 or sid2-Myc13 cdc16-116 cdc12-4A cells. myelin basic protein (Sigma) was used as a control substrate for Sid2-Myc13. high-speed centrifugation at 150,000g and low-speed centrifugation at 10,000g were performed for 30 min at room temperature using a TLA-100 rotor (Beckman Coulter) or a Centrifuge 5424 (Eppendorf) followed centrifugation, pellets and supernatants were separated. equal portions of pellets and supernatants were resolved by SDS-PAGE for Coomassie blue staining. cells were fixed in formaldehyde (Polysciences, Inc.) for 5 min. fixation was stopped by addition of PBS. cells were pelleted and washed three more times in PBS. cdc121451\u20131538, cdc12 truncations, rpn11+, and sid2+ were tagged endogenously at the 3\u2032 end with HA3:kanR, V53:kanR, V53:hygR, Flag3:kanR, GFP3:hygR, RFP:natR, or myc13:hygR cassettes as previously described. cdc16-116 strains were induced by shifting cultures for 3\u20134 h to 36\u00b0C. cells were first synchronized in interphase by centrifugal elutriation using an Avanti J-26 XPI centrifuge. a pSK vector was constructed that contained 5\u2032 cdc12 flank, full-length cdc12+, kanR cassette, and 3\u2032 cdc12 flank. overexpression of full-length cdc12+ or cdc12 fragments was controlled by thiamine-repressible nmt promoters of pREP1 or pSGP527a. expression was kept off by addition of 5 g/mL thiamine to the medium. expression was induced by washing and/or culturing in medium lacking thiamine. samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE in the presence of 5 M PhosTag acrylamide per the manufacturer's protocol (Wako Chemical) recombinant proteins were produced in competent BL21 cells and purified on amylose beads (New England Biolabs) or His-Bind resin (EMD Millipore) rabbit skeletal muscle actin (Cytoskeleton, Inc.) was resuspended in general actin buffer (5 mM Tris HCl at pH 8, 0.2 mM CaCl2, 0.2 mM ATP, 0.5 mM DTT) to a concentration of 24 M. samples were either centrifuged or diluted 1:100 in 70 nM rhodamine\u2013phalloidin. a spinning disc confocal microscope (Ultraview LCI, PerkinElmer) is equipped with a 100 NA 1.40 planApo oil immersion objective, a 488-nm argon ion laser (GFP and mCherry), a 594-nm helium neon laser (RFP and mCherry) and a personal DeltaVision microscope system. all cells were grown to and/or arrested in log phase before fixation or live- time-lapse imaging was performed using an ONIX microfluidics perfusion system (CellASIC) cells were loaded into Y04C plates for 5 sec at 8 psi.
