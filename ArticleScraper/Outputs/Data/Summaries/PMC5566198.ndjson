{"summary": "the systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) is descended from a long lineage of terminological artifacts spanning almost 50 years. its origin dates back to 1965, when the College of American Pathologists published the Systematized Nomenclature of Pathology. the merger of SNOMED RT (Reference Terminology) and the United Kingdom\u2019s Clinical Terms Version 3 (also known as Read Codes) gave rise to SNOMED CT. many existing EHRs use ICD as a clinical terminology to directly encode clinical information. ICD serves many important functions (which cannot be replaced by SNOMED CT), but the fact that it is a statistical classification poses some limitations on its use in EHRs. ICD-9-CM, ICD-10-CM, and SNOMED CT Condition SNOMED CT disease codes Corresponding ICD-9-CM code Corresponding ICD-10-CM code Congenital skin anomalies 79468000 Familial benign pemphigus 5132005 Keratosis pilaris... (total 21 codes) 757.39 Other specified congenital anomalies of skin Q82.8 Other specified congenital malformations of skin Acidosis 594550 only 1.5% of problem list terms could not be represented in SNOMED CT with post-coordination. but from an implementation perspective, post-coordination is nontrivial. challenges include data entry interface design, data storage and retrieval. use is likely to cause confusion and opposition. in data entry, clinical users may be confused by the NOS and NEC codes. a concept code always represents the same meaning over time. the code 480.8 Pneumonia due to other virus not elsewhere classified included SARS Pneumonia before 2003, but not afterwards, because 480.3 Pneumonia due to SARS-associated coronavirus was added. a strict hierarchy is necessary in a statistical classification, to avoid double counting. the CORE Problem List Subset of SNOMED CT was first published in 2009. we identified a subset of SNOMED CT concepts commonly used in actual problem list data. the first CORE Subset was based on datasets from seven large-scale healthcare institutions. study examined two properties of the CORE Subset. first, we assessed the coverage of the CORE Subset at the term- and usage-level. second, we studied the CORE Subset\u2019s pattern of growth to date. many rare congenital skin anomalies are encompassed by a single code in ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM, compared to SNOMED CT. the lack of specificity in ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM will affect the ability of the EHR to deliver disease-specific clinical decision support. post-coordination could increase SNOMED CT\u2019s coverage of summary-level clinical concepts from 80 to 96%. but from an implementation perspective, post-coordination is nontrivial. challenges include data entry interface design, data storage and retrieval, and computational requirements. in SNOMED CT, there are words and phrases directly used in clinical discourse. in some areas of ICD, the emphasis seems to be more on public health than the individual patient. in data entry, clinical users may be confused by the NOS and NEC codes. the clinician can use codes at any level of specificity. in SNOMED CT, a concept code always represents the same meaning. the subtle change in the meaning of NEC codes is even more problematic. a researcher can retrieve descendants of 2929001 Occlusion of artery (183 concepts), excluding those whose finding site is mesenteric artery or renal artery (11 concepts) in ICD-9-CM, she will need to manually search for a list of codes like 414.0 Coronary atherosclerosis 416.0 Idiopathic pulmonary arteriosclerosis 437.0 Cerebral atherosclerosis 440 Atherosclerosis. etiologies and management strategies are lumped together in these terminologies. one unique feature of SNOMED CT is extensibility by post-coordination. it is possible to determine equivalence and subsumption between existing concepts and post-coordinated expressions. only 1.5% of problem list terms could not be represented in SNOMED CT with post-coordination. but from an implementation perspective, post-coordination is nontrivial. challenges include data entry interface design, data storage and retrieval. ICD needs to ensure that codes are mutually exclusive (ie, there is only one way to code a condition) and jointly exhaustive (ie, that there is always a code for any condition) only codes at the lowest level (the leaf codes) can be used. the unspecified codes are used when specific information is missing. the code 480.8 Pneumonia due to other virus not elsewhere classified included SARS Pneumonia before 2003, but not afterwards, because 480.3 Pneumonia due to SARS-associated coronavirus was added. logical definitions in SNOMED CT make it possible to retrieve concepts using relationships and attributes. the CORE Problem List Subset of SNOMED CT was first published in 2009. the first CORE Subset was based on datasets from seven large-scale healthcare institutions. the first CORE Subset was based on the most commonly used problem list terms. we assessed the coverage of the CORE Subset at the term- and usage level. we first calculated the CORE Subset\u2019s coverage of the frequently used terms and their corresponding usage in the source datasets. to estimate the future growth of the CORE Subset, we did a retrospective \u201cgrowth experiment\u201d by \u201cgrowing\u201d the subset one at a time. the CORE Subset will grow at a progressively slower rate and eventually level off or only change very slowly. we examined the relationship between CORE Subset size and term coverage by scatter plot. we used linear regression to estimate the potential ceiling of the CORE Subset. % KP 26 890 2961 (11.0) 2657 (89.7) 85.3 1000 (33.8) 41.8 1139 (38.5) 54.8 VA 21 221 2069 (9.7) 1983 (95.8) 93.8 1292 (62.5) 60.6 1089 (52.6) 64.8 MA 14 921 3610 (24.2) 3165 (87.7) 86.4 1037 (28.7) 38.4 1396 (38.7) 48.4 NU 13 126 3320 (25.3) 3154 (95.0) 9 the average usage coverage was 83.7%. 55% were direct parents or children of CORE concepts. the missing concepts were generally more specific than the CORE concepts. the initial base CORE Subset was built from the two largest (KP and VA) and two smallest (RI and BI) datasets. there were 32 unique paths to build the full CORE Subset from the initial base Subset. 9 KP, VA, RI, BI, HA IH 4235 64.7 KP, VA, RI, BI, HA IH MA 3232 54.1 KP, VA, RI, BI, RI, BI, RI, BI, NU HA 5217 58.3 KP, VA, RI, BI, MA, NU HA 5217 58.3 KP, VA, RI, BI, MA, HA NU 5384 7 Figure 1 shows the characteristics of the eight datasets and their mappings to SNOMED CT, ICD-9-CM, and ICD-10-CM. the problem list vocabularies varied considerably in the number of unique terms.

CONCLUSION SNOMED CT is inherently more suitable for capturing clinical information in EHRs than the ICD classifications because of its better content coverage."}
