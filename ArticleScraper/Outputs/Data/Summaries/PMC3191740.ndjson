{"summary": "adenoviruses, coronaviruses, human enteroviruses (HEV), human rhinoviruses (HRV), influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses (RSV) are well-known causes of acute respiratory tract infections in both industrialized and developing countries. a nasal swab sample was obtained from children by inserting a sterile nylon swab into the nostril to a depth of 2\u20134 cm. with a second swab, a throat specimen was collected by rubbing the tonsils and the posterior wall of the pharynx. the samples were then placed in a vial containing 2 mL of RNAlater solution. for the detection of influenza A and B viruses, RSV, PIV 1, 2, and 3 and cDNA were amplified in two separate real-time multiplex PCRs [20] with minor modifications. other, slightly modified real-time PCRs were used for the detection of influenza A subtypes H1 and H3. a nasal swab sample was obtained from children by inserting a sterile nylon swab into the nostril to a depth of 2\u20134 cm. with a second swab, a throat specimen was collected by rubbing the tonsils and the posterior wall of the pharynx. the specimens were then placed in a vial containing 2 mL of RNAlater solution. real-time RT-PCR for the detection of HRV was performed as described [24] and of enteroviruses (HEV) the test is not 100% specific but reacts with some HRV strains. the overall proportion of virus-positive specimens was similar in children under or over two years. all adenovirus, influenza virus A, RSV, and all but one HBoV and \u201ctrue HEV\u201d detections were in the youngest age group. twenty-nine specimens contained two different viruses and another two specimens three different viruses. no obvious pattern could be seen in the mutual associations of two or three viruses. there were more multiple infections in children older than 2 years than in the younger than 2 years group. all major respiratory virus groups tested for can be detected in Nigerian children with respiratory tract infection. all viruses investigated, including the more recently discovered HMPV and HBoV, were present in at least some of the specimens. nasal or throat swab does not necessarily prove an etiological role of this pathogen in the concurrent disease. etiological diagnosis of LRTI is especially difficult without invasive procedures, but when searched for, rhinovirus has been found in alveolar lavage specimens from pneumonia patients. previous studies on respiratory tract viruses in Nigeria have not tested for the presence of rhinoviruses. influenza virus type C was as common as adenoviruses in this study. double or triple infections were detected in 16% of the virus-positive children. this is comparable to that observed by others."}
