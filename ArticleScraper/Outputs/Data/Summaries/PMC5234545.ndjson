{"summary": "quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay is considered the gold standard method for detection and quantification of enteric RNA viruses such as hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis E virus (HEV) or human noroviruses (NoV) worldwide, HAV infections account for 1.4 million cases annually and about 102 million asymptomatic and symptomatic cases occurred all together in 2013. the use of wild-type bacteriophage MS2 instead of MS2 PLP has two disadvantages. wild-type bacteriophage has the ability to proliferate \u2013 theoretically, in a specific sample such as those with fetus. the wild-type bacteriophage MS2 cannot be used as a highly specific PCV because its genome does not contain the specific target sequences. the advantages of MS2 PLP include their ability to protect the control RNA contained in their capsid from degradation by ubiquitous ribonucleases and their stability during long-term storage. the control sequence with a total length of 150 bp was synthesized de novo (Elisabeth Pharmacon, Czech Republic) the specificity of the control sequence was verified using BLAST1. it was also analyzed using OligoAnalyzer 3.1 software2 for the ability to form secondary structures. NEBuffer 2 (New England Biolabs, UK; NEB), 100 U HindIII and 10 U BlpI endonucleases were purified using the Qiagen PCR purification kit (Qiagen) the cleaved PCR product was further purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) purified plasmid AU2 was dephosphorylated using 0.25 U calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (NEB) added to restriction mixture. dephosphorylation reaction was run at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. two milliliters of the culture were transferred to 200 ml of LB broth containing 30 g/ml of kanamycin. the pellet was resuspended in 200 ml of LB broth containing 30 g/ml of kanamycin. cell suspension was centrifuged at 600 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. intact MS2 PLP were verified by transmission electron microscopy. supernatant (1 ml) was incubated with 100 U of DNase I (NEB) and 50 U of RNase A (Qiagen) for 40 min. the purity of obtained MS2 PLP was controlled using agarose gel electrophoresis and TEM. the number of MS2 PLP was determined by UV spectrophotometry using the Avogadro constant, extinction coefficient of 0.125 mg/ml of MS2 bacteriophage per absorbance unit. the suspension containing MS2 PLP was diluted 10-fold in water. the samples were analyzed in hexaplicates and the mean and standard deviation values were calculated. RT-qPCR was used as a fourth method for MS2 PLP quantification. the DNA-containing IAC sequence and the fragment encoding the specific control sequence were prepared according to Vojkovska et al. (2015). in vitro transcription of the IAC and the fragment encoding the specific control sequence derived from thylacine and the moa bird was performed. qPCR was performed using the Roche LightCycler 480 under the following reaction conditions: initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 45 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 10 s, 60\u00b0C for 30 s and 72\u00b0C for 10 s. RNA in vitro transcripts were quantified by fluorimetry using the Qubit RNA BR Assay Kit (Life Technologies) and Qubit 3.0 fluorometer (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. RNA from liver tissue (50 mg aseptically taken from three different inner-liver locations) was isolated using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen), while RNA from serum (200 l) and feces (200 l from 250 mg of feces resuspended in 2.25 ml of phosphate-buffered saline buffer \u2013 PBS) was isolated using the QIAamp Viral RNA kit (Qiagen) RT-qPCR quantity value (x) is divided by 5 to obtain the quantity of RNA molecules in 1 l (RT-qPCR uses 5 l of template RNA), followed by multiplication by elution volume (y) control sequence was derived from mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences of two extinct species. PCR products were examined using agarose gel electrophoresis (1%) staining with ethidium bromide. they were purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Germany) and subsequently digested at 37\u00b0C for 2 h. the composition of the restriction enzyme digest reaction was 500 ng of PCR product. AU2 plasmid was dephosphorylated using 0.25 U calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (NEB) added to restriction mixture. dephosphorylation reaction run at 37\u00b0C for 2 h. agar plates containing 30 g/ml of kanamycin (Sigma-Aldrich) were purified overnight. the presence of specific inserts was confirmed by PCR using vector-specific primers. the fragment encoding the control sequence derived from thylacine and the moa bird was obtained by PCR using a de novo template. the cleaved PCR product was further purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) the plasmid contains a fragment encoding MS2 maturase and coat protein. restriction enzyme digest reaction was 500 ng of plasmid DNA, 5 l NEBuffer 2, 100 U HindIII and 10 U BlpI endonucleases in a final volume of 50 l. the dephosphorylation reaction was run at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. two milliliters of the culture were transferred to 200 ml of LB broth containing 30 g/ml of kanamycin. pellet was resuspended in 200 ml of LB broth containing 30 g/ml of kanamycin. cell suspension was centrifuged at 600 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. intact MS2 PLP were verified by transmission electron microscopy. the purity of obtained MS2 PLP was controlled using agarose gel electrophoresis. the number of MS2 PLP was determined by UV spectrophotometry using the Avogadro constant, extinction coefficient of 0.125 mg/ml of MS2 bacteriophage per absorbance unit at 260 nm and a molecular weight of 3.0 106. the results revealed that the concentration of MS2 PLP in a suspension of OD260 was 1 is 2.5 1013 particles/ml. the samples were analyzed in hexaplicates and the mean and standard deviation values were calculated. RT-qPCR was used as a fourth method for MS2 PLP quantification. in vitro transcription of the IAC and the fragment encoding the specific control sequence derived from thylacine and the moa bird was performed. qPCR was performed using the Roche LightCycler 480 Probes Master (Roche), 5 pmol of the NP F and TM R primers, 10 pmol of the TM F and TM R primers, 4 pmol of the NP P probe and 5 l template cDNA. initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 10 min followed by 45 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 10 s, 60\u00b0C for 30 s and 72\u00b0C for 10 s. quantification standards were prepared from a 10-fold dilution of in vitro-prepared RNA transcripts of the fragment encoding the specific control sequence derived from thylacine and the moa bird. RNA in vitro transcripts were quantified by fluorimetry using the Qubit RNA BR as RNA from leafy green vegetables (25 g) and swabs (100 cm2, cotton swab rinsed in 5 ml of PBS) was isolated using NucliSENS Magnetic extraction reagents (bioM\u00e9rieux, Durham, NC, USA) RT-qPCR for detection of MS2 PLP was performed as described above. PCR uses 5 l of template RNA) followed by multiplication by elution volume (y). production of MS2 coat protein in cell culture after induction was controlled by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. only basal production of MS2 coat protein was observed in the control IPTG non-induced cell culture. purification of MS2 PLP Three opalescent layers were distinguishable inside the ultracentrifugation tube after ultracentrifugation. all layers were removed and the presence of MS2 PLP in these layers was controlled by agarose gel electrophoresis (1%) and staining with ethidium bromide. the top layer contained the highest amount of MS2 PLP. the results of MS2 PLP quantification experiments are summarized in Table 2. the large black \u201cdot\u201d is the latex standard and the white dots are MS2 PLP. the scale is 500 nm. RT-qPCR quantification method was chosen as the most accurate method. it was the only method capable of identifying a specific control RNA encapsulated inside the MS2 PLP. stability of MS2 PLP was checked by agarose gel electrophoresis (1%) and staining with ethidium bromide. extraction efficiency of MS2 phage-like particles (MS2 PLP) isolated from different types of matrices artificially contaminated with 5 106 MS2 PLP per sample. RT-qPCR was run in duplicate for each sample. pAU-TM expression vector carrying all necessary information for the production of MS2 PLP was successfully prepared. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blot (right part of the picture) results clearly showed spontaneous assembly of MS2 PLP in the induced cell culture. 1,6, E. coli BL21 (DE3) negative control; 2,5, IPTG-non-induced culture; 3,4, IPTG-induced culture. the integrity of purified MS2 PLP was inspected by TEM. FIGURE 3. Result of agarose gel electrophoresis detection of MS2 phage-like particles (MS2 PLP) in three layers removed after ultracentrifugation from the tube. the top layer contained the highest amount of MS2 PLP (the band on the gel around 1.5 kb) in the case of RT-qPCR quantification of MS2 PLP, undiluted, 10-fold and 100-fold suspensions of thermally lyzed MS2 PLP were tested in order to detect possible inhibitory effects of heat denatured proteins on RT-qPCR results. dilution was done only in RT-qPCR quantification of MS2 PLP experiment in which high quantity of MS2 PLP was expected. TEM inspection revealed that prepared MS2 PLP did not form aggregates and that the suspension was homogeneous. the scale is 200 nm. RT-qPCR was run in duplicate for each sample. nucleic acid isolation efficiency was calculated according to the formula described within the text. analysis requires strict control to avoid inaccurate results. some recent studies have shown that MNV-1 virus mimicked the behavior of NoV during sample processing to the least extent and with the most dissimilar recovery to NoV. besides MNV-1, other PCV \u2013Turnip crinkle virus (TCV), Mengovirus, Tulane virus and bacteriophage MS2 were also tested and bacteriophage MS2 and Tulane virus performed relatively well across all spike levels. a negative feature of MS2 PLP is that they do not form plaques because they do not carry a gene for lysis. the number of MS2 PLP may be determined using the Avogadro constant, extinction coefficient of 1 OD260 = 0.125 mg/ml of MS2 bacteriophage. s of MS2 PLP obtained using UV spectrophotometry, fluorimetry and TEM were consistent. the measured number of MS2 PLP was about 1 log10 lower (2.89 1012 MS2 PLP/ml) than by previously described methods. this indicates that the ratio of MS2 PLP carrying specific control RNA sequence in a population of prepared MS2 PLP is only around 10%. RT-qPCR assays can be performed to detect various types of enteric RNA viruses. the exact number of MS2 PLP added to samples (5 106 particles) was chosen according to ISO/TS 15216-1 and ISO/TS 15216-2. extraction efficiency from serum matrix (77.04%) is almost 10-fold higher than extraction efficiency from feces (8.77%). similar impact of sample composition is also obvious in swab and vegetable samples. use of PCV in RT-qPCR detection of RNA viruses is highly beneficial. this requirement is based on need to maintain sufficient supply of PCV in the laboratory. in these cases, MS2 PLPs represents an alternative approach because they can be easily produced through bacterial cultures in high quantity. this production approach of MS2 PLPs excludes the difference in virus source and provides for high quality, standardized PCV stocks. the manuscript: PV and PeK; all authors approved the version to be published in Frontiers in microbiology. authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
