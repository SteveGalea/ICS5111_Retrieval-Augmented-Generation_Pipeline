{"summary": "the prokaryote Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a major cause of respiratory disease in humans. the incidence of infection in the very young and the elderly is on the rise. for adults alone the annual economic burden of CAP is > $17 billion. the success rate for laboratory culture is poor, even for experienced labs. serologic testing has limited sensitivity and specificity, a high tendency for false-negatives, requires paired sera resulting in retrospective diagnosis. the most efficient means for detection is quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) the requirement for separate tests for detection and genotyping, as well as the cost, complexity, and expertise required, limits the practicality for widespread, point-of-care use. a rapid, simple, diagnostic platform capable of simultaneous detection and genotyping would greatly improve the control of M. pneumoniae disease. standard Raman spectroscopy is inherently limited by weak signals for detection. highly ordered silver nanorod array (NA) substrates fabricated using oblique angle deposition (OAD) yield consistent SERS enhancement factors of around 108, with less than 15% variation between substrate batches. highly reproducible detection capabilities of NA-SERS have been well demonstrated for multiple infectious agents, including RSV, rotavirus, influenza, HIV, adenovirus, SARS coronavirus, and M. pneumoniae. nsal and pathogenic mycoplasmas demonstrated that the NA-SERS platform could distinguish M. pneumoniae from its clinically relevant closest phylogenetic relatives. a panel of 30 additional clinical isolates consisting of 13 type 1 strains, 11 type 2 strains, and six type 2 variant strains were grown, harvested, and prepared for SERS analysis. cells were then syringe-passaged 10 with a 25 gauge needle and aliquots made for determination of protein content, plating on PPLO agar [32] for CFU determination, DNA extraction for genome equivalent determination, and SERS analysis. mycoplasma and medium-only negative control samples were diluted in sterile DI water to a concentration of 105 cells/l. plasma penetrans (UAB reference strain collection, 1995), Mycoplasma pirum (ATCC 25960), Mycoplasma salivarium (ATCC 23064), Ureaplasma parvum (Up1; ATCC 27813), and Ureaplasma urealyticum (Uu11; ATCC 33695) were originally intended to be included in the panel. attempts at culturing these organisms were unsuccessful. two 400 l aliquots for each were centrifuged at 14,000 RPM for 20 min. the pellets were frozen for shipment to UGA, where they were stored at -80\u00b0C. gene equivalents for all non-M. pneumoniae samples were calculated from DNA concentrations obtained from this analysis. genome mass calculated for this study based on published genome lengths and known G+C contents from the GenBank database. NA-SERS and chemometric analysis NA-SERS substrates were prepared by OAD as described [21, 29, 36, 37] two wells per substrate were intentionally left blank to obtain a background SERS reading on the naked nanorod substrate only. a total of three separate NA substrates were used for these experiments. spectra were deliberately collected from multiple locations within a single substrate, as well as from multiple substrates. unless otherwise specified, all PLS-DA models were cross-validated using a Venetian blinds algorithm with 10 data splits. unless otherwise specified, all PLS-DA models were generated using between 110\u2013495 total spectra per model. nt mycoplasma samples were syringe-passaged 10 with a 25 gauge needle. cells were then syringe-passaged 10 with a 25 gauge needle. aliquots made for determination of protein content, plating on PPLO agar. mycoplasma buccale, mycoplasma orale, and mycoplasma penetrans were originally intended to be included in the panel. attempts at culturing these organisms were unsuccessful. for each culture, 500 l to 1 ml of stock culture was inoculated into approximately 30 ml of SP4, Hayflick\u2019s, or 10B. aliquots were made for spotting onto a blood agar plate to test for contamination. two 400 l pellets for each were centrifuged at 14,000 RPM for 20 min. the pellets were frozen for shipment to UGA, where they were stored at -80\u00b0C. concentration and absorbance measurements for the Bicinchoninic acid assay were performed on a nanodrop instrument (Model ND-1000, Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE) using software V3.5.2. Genome equivalents for all non-M. pneumoniae samples were determined from DNA concentrations obtained from this analysis and a genome mass calculated for this study. spectra were collected from five random locations within each sample spot. two wells per substrate were intentionally left blank to obtain a background SERS reading on the naked nanorod substrate only. a total of three separate NA substrates were used for these experiments. unless otherwise specified, all PLS-DA models were cross-validated using a Venetian blinds algorithm with 10 data splits. results and discussion Detection of M. pneumoniae clinical isolates. no notable differences in genome equivalents or SERS spectra were observed between M. pneumoniae samples relative to growth phase at time of harvest. average SERS spectra of nanorod substrate background, growth medium control, and M. pneumoniae samples are shown in Fig 1. each class exhibiting a distinct band pattern, as expected. 1.1 3.11x106 141.5 1005 NY 1999 2 S 0.28 1.5 4.24x106 66.0 1134 IN 1999 2 S 0.30 2.2 6.22x106 70.8 988 Canada 1992 1 S 0.12 2.0 5.65x106 19.3 678 Denmark 1962 1 S 0.12 3.5 9.9x106 12.1 682 Denmark 1988 2 S 0.16 2.1 5.94x106 26.9 983 SC 1988 2 S 0.16 1.6 4.53x106 35.3 386 TX 1994 2 S 0.10 n = 390 pre-processed NA-SERS spectra collected from both substrates were included in the model. the cross-validated statistics show that NA-SERS correctly classified all 32 clinical isolates as M. pneumoniae regardless of global origin, year isolated, genotype, or macrolide susceptibility phenotype. each panel represents a cross-validated class prediction score for (A) substrate background; (B) class 2, growth medium control; and (C) class 3, all M. pneumoniae strains. cross-validated statistics were obtained using Venetian blinds with 10 data splits. phylogenies and 16S rDNA phylogeny were chosen for analysis alongside M. pneumoniae strain M129 and a growth medium control. analyses were done to determine total protein and DNA content, the latter allowing calculation of genome equivalents based on known genome sizes and G+C content. 1.2 2.6x105 261 ND Ureaplasma parvum 727,289 0.068 1.7 4.3x105 158 4.5x104 Ureaplasma urealyticum 874,478 0.067 2 4.2x105 159 5.6x103 Mycoplasma pneumoniae 816,394 0.061 1 2.24x106 27.2 8.4x104 aGenome sizes obtained from published sources [35] and known G+C contents. a final PLS-DA model was generated using pre-processed NA-SERS spectra. this model contained 25 growth medium control spectra, 25 M129 spectra, 25 FH spectra, 10 spectra each per other M. pneumoniae clinical isolates. each panel represents a cross-validated class prediction score for (A) class 1, growth medium control; (B) class 2, all M. pneumoniae strains; and (C) class 3, all other human commens cross-validated statistics were obtained using Venetian blinds. cross-validated statistics were obtained using 10 data splits to represent prediction performance of the PLS-DA model for M. pneumoniae detection. a second PLS-DA model was generated using 160 pre-processed NA-SERS spectra consisting of the 50 type 1 and 2 reference strain control spectra. a third model was generated using 110 pre-processed NA-SERS spectra consisting of the 11 other type 2 clinical isolate samples (10 spectra per isolate, 110 total spectra) strain control spectra and all spectra from the type 2V clinical isolate samples (10 spectra per isolate, 110 total spectra) this model was built to discriminate between 3 classes, type 1 reference strain control, type 2 reference strain control, or type 2V clinical isolate spectra. existing methods are capable of identifying variant strains as unique from type 1 and 2 isolate strains. the light gray shapes differ by cluster to indicate the individual clinical isolates. the strain/isolate designation is indicated above the brackets for each cluster. cross-validated sensitivity, specificity and class error for panels A-C were obtained using Venetian blinds with 10 data splits.
