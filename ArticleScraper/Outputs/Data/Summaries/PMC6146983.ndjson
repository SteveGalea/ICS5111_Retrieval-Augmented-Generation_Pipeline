{"summary": "glycyrrhizin (GL) is a triterpenoid saponin consisting of one glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) covalently linked with two glucuronic acids (GlcA) GL has also been used worldwide as a natural sweetener due to its sweet taste. conversion of GL into GAMG through chemical methods requires a boiling acidic solution and sophisticated instruments. biotransformation of GL into GAMG via -glucuronidases (GUSs) is an environmentally friendly approach due to the mild reaction conditions and the higher yield of GAMG. most GUSs have been classified as GH2 enzymes. a small number have been categorized as GH1, GH79, and GH30 enzymes. human endogenous GUSs and intestinal bacterial GUSs belong to GH2. many fungi, such as aspergillus terreus (33), A. niger, Penicillium frangnatum, and penicillium cyclopium (34) can convert GL to GAMG. but their low substrate specificities cause the further conversion of GAMG to GAMG. a fed-batch fermentation in a 150-liter fermentor was developed to transform GL into GAMG via T. pinophilus Li-93. all the GL was converted to GAMG after 42 h, while no GA was detected. the enzyme from strain Li-93 was induced by adding GL to the culture medium. GL catalyzed by culture supernatants of control strain P. pastoris GS115/pGAPZ and engineered strain P. pastoris GS115/pGAPZ-Tpgus79a respectively. GlcA has no absorbance at 254 nm, which was the wavelength for HPLC detection, so the peak for GlcA cannot be observed in the HPLC chromatograms. acetone precipitation 36.63 11.43 0.31 6.46 75.25 HiTrap SP FF chromatography 0.23 2.10 9.40 195.83 13.82 HiTrap DEAE HP chromatography 0.06 0.712 11.97 249.38 4.69 Peptide mass fingerprinting of TpGUS79A was obtained by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization\u2013tandem time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-TOF MS) the results native PAGE and analytical ultracentrifuge analysis suggested that TpGUS79A behaves as a monomeric protein. the signal peptide consists of the first 19 amino acid residues. the N-terminal amino acid sequence was determined to be AQNHK. the molecular weights of native and recombinant TpGUS79A are much larger than the theoretical value (Fig. 3c) the molecular weight of TpGUS79A was sharply reduced after treatment with peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase) more than 90% of TpGUS79A activity was lost in the presence of 10 mM Fe2+, Cu2+, or Al3+. dithiothreitol (DTT), EDTA, glutathione (GSH), -mercaptoethanol (ME) and urea were not detrimental to TpGUS79A activity, instead stimulating the activity. curonide, quercetin 3-O--d-glucoside, baicalin, and baicalein 7-O--d-glucoside as flavonoid glycosides, and pNP-sugars as artificial substrates. TpGUS79A showed the highest activity toward GL (100%), followed by quercetin 3-O--d-glucuronide (51.2%), baicalin (13.2%), and pNP--GlcA kcat/Km value toward GL was >1,000-fold higher than that toward pNP--GlcA. activity on GL was taken as 100%. b ND, could not be detected. modeled structure showed a QMEAN Z-score of 4.72, indicating some part of the modeled structure may still be inaccurate. modeled structure was very similar to that of AcGlcA79A, and sequence coverage was 82%. glu192 and Glu325, located in the 4th and 7th -strands of the TIM barrel, respectively, were identified to be catalytic residues. sequence alignment suggested that TpGUS79A adopts a retaining mechanism during catalysis. activity of only the E325A mutant was partially rescued by adding acetic acid as an exogenous nucleophile. ser330 forms a polar contact with aglycone, while three residues, Met277, Gly278, and Ala279, form a hydrophobic region on one side of the substrate channel. the hydrogen bond is shown by yellow dashed lines. the dashed boxes indicate the conserved sequences containing catalytic residues. glycan could not be recognized due to little interaction. substantial mutagenesis of these residues was performed to verify their function. the mutants showed similar optimal temperatures for catalysis. the change in activity was not due to the changed temperature profile. only ser330 formed one hydrogen bond with the O atom of GL. when mutated to other residues, around 44 to 73% of activity was lost. the left side of the aglycone was in close proximity to a negative electrostatic potential, although no interaction was established with the aglycone. after 36 h, 93% of GL was converted to GAMG. at 41 h, 540 g ammonium glycyrrhizinate was fed into the system every 24 h. this is the largest-scale preparation of GAMG through GL hydrolysis ever reported. purified TpGUS79A was obtained with a specific activity of 11.97 U mg protein1. total amount of pure protein was 60 g from 1,500 ml of culture supernatant. glycyrrhizin catalyzed by T. pinophilus Li-93 and the engineered strain P. pastoris GS115/pGAPZ-Tpgus79a. lane 1, N-deglycosylated TpGUS79A-P; lane 2, purified TpGUS79A-P. putative N-glycosylation sites shown by closed circles. a coding sequence of 1,554 bases (designated Tpgus79a) was searched against the genome sequence of T. pinophilus Li-93. a coding sequence of 1,554 bases and a genomic sequence of 1,790 bases were amplified from cDNA and genomic DNA of the protein. native PAGE and analytical ultracentrifuge analysis suggested that TpGUS79A behaves as a monomeric protein. the signal peptide consists of the first 19 amino acid residues and has a theoretical molecular weight of 57.2 kDa. however, the molecular weights of both native and recombinant TpGUS79A are much larger than the theoretical value. pGUS79A showed very low sequence identities with other previously reported GUSs of GH79, such as anGlcAase from A. niger (34% identity) (24), NcGlcAase from N. crassa (33% identity) (24), and AcGlcA79A from Acidobacterium capsulatum (25% identity) (37). the highest activity of TpGUS79A was observed at 50\u00b0C and pH glycine-HCl buffer (pH 2.0 to 3.0); acetate buffer (pH 3.0 to 5.5); Tris-HCl buffer (pH 5.5 to 7.5); glycine-NaOH (pH 8.5 to 10); error bars show 1 standard deviation. substrate specificity of TpGUS79A was measured using GL, GAMG, and glycyrrhetinic acid 3-O-mono-glucoside (GAM- the kinetic parameters for these substrates were determined to further elaborate the substrate specificity of TpGUS79A. TpGUS79A showed the highest catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) on GL. the kcat/Km value for pNP--GlcA was 13-fold higher than that for quercetin 3-glucuronide.

TpGUS79A lost around 50% of its activity when Ser95 was mutated to alanine. TpGUS79A was completely deactivated when Asn191 was mutated to alanine. Tyr276 was located parallel to the second glycan moiety of GL. the activity was tested by GL hydrolysis under standard conditions. glucuronidase from Aspergillus oryzae Li-3 in complex with GAMG was solved. a negative electrostatic potential was also observed in the active pocket of PGUS. this is the largest-scale preparation of GAMG through GL hydrolysis ever reported. a unique -glucuronidase (designated TpGUS79A) capable of selectively hydrolyzing GL into GAMG without the production of GA as a by-product was identified from the filamentous fungus T. pinophilus Li-93. TpGUS79A is in monomeric form in solution, with a molecular weight of 85 kDa. TpGUS79A is classified as a GH79 enzyme but shares very low sequence identity (less than 35%) with other GUSs from GH79. compared to other GUSs with low substrate specificity for GL (33, 40), TpGUS79A was more sensitive to heat and alkaline pH. most of the GUSs used for biotransformation of natural glucuronides showed much higher binding affinities and catalytic activities on artificial substrates. however, TpGUS79A showed the lowest binding affinity for pNP--GlcA (Km value of 25.56 mM) and the lowest activity on pNP--GlcA. TpGUS79A is a highly competitive biocatalyst ready to be applied in the production of GAMG through GL hydrolysis. it also displays activity on flavonoid glucuronides, such as quercetin 3-glucuronide and baicalin. but its activity on baicalin is much lower than those of the GUSs with high specificity for baicalin. the nucleophilic residues of GH79 GUSs from bacteria and fungi are located in the downstream conserved sequence (W/F)XXXGNE (45), which is quite different from those of plant GH79 GUSs and mammal heparanases (PGKKV-WLGE) and of GH2 GUSs. the gene for TpGUS79A was cloned and verified by heterologous expression in P. pastoris. a fed-batch fermentation in a 150-liter fermentor was established to prepare GAMG through GL hydrolysis by T. pinophilus Li-93. the vector PMD-19T and E. coli Top10 were used for gene expression. pNP-glucopyranosiduronic acid (pNP-GlcA), trypsin, bovine serum albumin, and glycyrrhizin (GL) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (San Diego, CA, USA) all other chemicals used in this study were of the highest analytical grade commercially available. the culture supernatant of T. pinophilus Li-93 was obtained by centrifugation (13,000 g for 10 min) the cell-free culture supernatant was mixed with ice-cold acetone at a 1:1 (vol/vol) ratio and centrifuged at 15,000 g for 15 min. the protein was eluted by using an increasing gradient of elution buffer (30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 500 mM NaCl) at concentrations ranging from 10 to 100% at a flow rate of 1 ml min1. the fractions with high specific activity were combined and used for further investigations. the scope of peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) mass scanning was from 700 Da to 3,500 Da. the dominant peptides were selected for further analysis by secondary ion mass spectrometry.
