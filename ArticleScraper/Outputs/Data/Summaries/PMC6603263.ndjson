{"summary": "study included 645 RSV- and 1878 influenza-infected hospitalized adults. patients with RSV were older than those with influenza. the demographic makeup of the KPSC membership closely mirrors the racially and sociodemographically diverse Southern California population and the California census population. more than 99% of members are community dwelling [16] nineteen individuals coinfected with RSV and influenza during the same hospitalization were excluded from the comparison. each member has a unique medical record number that is used as an identifier to retrieve and link variables from different databases. one-year survival after admission was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. survival rates between hospitalized persons infected with RSV or influenza were compared using the log-rank test. the analysis was performed using SAS Enterprise Guide 5.1 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) twenty-five individuals with both a positive RSV test and a positive influenza test during different hospitalizations were kept in the RSV cohort and removed from the influenza cohort. nineteen individuals coinfected with RSV and influenza during the same hospitalization were excluded from the comparison. one-year survival after admission was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. survival rates between hospitalized persons infected with RSV or influenza were compared using the log-rank test. the prevalence of several comorbidities was significantly different between patients hospitalized with RSV and those with influenza. congestive heart failure (35.3% vs 24.5%; P.001), diabetes (38.9% vs 44.6%; P =.012), COPD/chronic bronchitis/emphysema (29.8% vs 24.3%; P =.006), asthma (26.0% vs 18.6%; P.001 race.056 white (%) 425 (65.9) 1218 (64.9) black (%) 110 (17.0) 264 (14.1) Asian/Pacific Islander (%) 63 (9.8) 245 (13.0) Ethnicity.578 Hispanic (%) 149 (23.1) 471 (25.1) .006 Asthma (%) 168 (26.0) 349 (18.6).001 End stage renal disease (%) 36 (5.6) 117 (6.2) Any solid cancer (%) 72 (11.2) 151 (8.0).016 Leukemia (%) 12 (1.9) 17 (0.9).050 Lymphoma (%) 14 (2.2) 32 (1.7) Respiratory Syncytial Virus or Influenza Infection in Kaiser Permanente Southern California, 2011\u20132015 Patient Characteristics Respiratory Syncytial Virus (N = 645) Influenza (N = 1878) P Valuea Days from admission to positive RSV/influenza test result date (mean, SD, range) 2.5, 2.6, 0.0\u201335.0 2.6, 1.9, 0.0\u201320.0.402 Days from admission to positive RSV/influenza test result 1 person with c-infection of RSV and influenza within 7 days but not during the same hospitalization was counted in the RSV cohort and removed from the influenza cohort. hospital utilization was greater among those infected with RSV than with influenza. mortality during hospitalization (OR = 1.1; 95% CI, 0.8\u20131.7) for patients with RSV did not differ significantly from those with influenza. long-term mortality within 1 year of admission was significantly greater in the RSV cohort compared to the influenza cohort (OR = 1.3, 95% CI, 1.0\u20131.6) the 1-year survival rate after admission was significantly lower in older adults hospitalized with RSV compared to those hospitalized with influenza. adults hospitalized with RSV were slightly older and had greater frequency of baseline comorbidities than those hospitalized with influenza virus infection [6, 12, 14] pulmonary complications and findings, including pneumonia, tachypnea, hypoxia, and greater need for oxygen supplementation, and exacerbation of asthma were significantly greater among the RSV cohort. the impact of RSV on long-term survival may be a reflection of the potential for RSV to drive chronic inflammation associated with persistent, sometimes progressive, pulmonary disease. findings underscore the substantial morbidity, mortality, and healthcare utilization associated with RSV infection in the expanding population of older adults. the number of hospitalizations with RSV or with influenza detected in this study may not reflect the relative incidences of each pathogen over the study period. recognition and early identification of RSV as a potential cause of illness that is sometimes indistinguishable from influenza will become increasingly important in order to increase vaccine uptake among high-risk populations. the projected continued increase in the proportion of older adults in the population [25] underscores the growing unmet medical and public health need to develop vaccines and therapeutics. increased appreciation among adult providers of the frequency and severity of RSV disease among adults will be important to the uptake of RSV vaccines and therapeutics."}
