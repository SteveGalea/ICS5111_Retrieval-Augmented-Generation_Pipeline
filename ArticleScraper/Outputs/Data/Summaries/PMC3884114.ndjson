{"summary": "Imatinib is a protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor that acts on the bcr-abl gene of the abnormal Philadelphia chromosome in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) it is also used in acute lymphocytic leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) to inhibit c-transmembrane receptor (c-kit) and platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) tyrosine kinas specific findings were noted on neck and abdominal examinations. he underwent a bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) a microbiologic study including the culture of bacteria, fungus with Pneumocystis jirovecii, and Mycobacterium in bronchial specimens was all negative. the polymerase chain reaction assays of mycoplasma pneumonia, nine respiratory viruses such as influenza virus A and B, respiratory syncytial virus, metapneumo virus, rhino virus, parainfluenza virus, adeno virus, corona virus, fibroblastic plug formation in the alveoli with infiltration of chronic inflammatory cells and mild fibrous thickening in the interstitium. imatinib can cause pulmonary complications such as pleural effusion and pneumonitis. the pathophysiology of imatinib-induced interstitial pneumonitis has not been identified until now. the noncytotoxic type manifests as eosinophilic pneumonia, hypersensitive pneumonitis, or obstructive bronchiolitis, whereas the cytotoxic pattern manifests as interstitial edema. 23 of 27 patients with imatinib-induced interstitial pneumonitis recovered with corticosteroid treatment and discontinuation of the drug. four of 11 patients who were readministered 100-400 mg imatinib daily relapsed with interstitial pneumonitis. imatinib-induced pneumonitis can be fatal with irreversible results. it should be kept in mind that susseccful rechallenge with imatinib coud be another option for a underlying disease."}
