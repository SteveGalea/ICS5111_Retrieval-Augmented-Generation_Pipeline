{"summary": "Yersinia pestis is the bacterium that causes bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic forms of plague. all three suspected plague pandemics were caused by this bacterium (1\u20136). y. pestis directly evolved from Y. pseudotuberculosis, the cause of a self-limited mesenteric lymphadenitis, within the last 2,600 to 28,000 years (6, 7, 10\u201312) oligosaccharide core (core LPS), and (iii) the somatic O-polysaccharide outer region (also called O-antigen, O-specific antigen, or O-specific side chain) y. pestis does not contain an O-antigen (14, 15) and therefore the shortened LPS is also referred to as lipooligosaccharide (LOS). molecule-grabbing nonintegrin (hDC-SIGN, CD209a) is a receptor for the core LPS of several Gram-negative bacteria. y. pseudotuberculosis, via its core LPS-CD209 interaction, may hijack APCs to be disseminated to lymph nodes, spleen and liver. Y. pseudotuberculosis strains possess an O-antigen, the production of which was lost by Y. pestis during evolution. the genes from the Y. pseudotuberculosis strains showed extreme diversity, which echoes the conclusion of the Cui's study. lack of O-antigen is essential for plasminogen activation and invasiveness of Y. pestis (34). y. pseudotuberculosis rather than Y. pestis show multiple mutations of O-antigen synthesis genes. in the heatmap, rows represent six O-antigen synthesis genes. Y. pestis KIM10-ail (rough) and E. coli K12 180 (rough) invade mouse macrophages. both deep rough and smooth strains resulted in a reduced level of invasion of mouse macrophages in both assays. CFDA-SE labeled and unlabelled bacteria are indicated by open and filled symbols, respectively. deep rough mutants of Gram-negative bacteria in general are more sensitive to biological killing (39, 40) macrophages from the mouse peritoneal cavity express SIGNR1. Y. pestis invades CHO-SIGNR1 but not other CHO transfectants. CHO-mDC-SIGN, CHO-SIGNR1, CHO-mDEC-205, and CHO-mLangerin (CD207) a specific sugar epitope within the core LPS of Y. pestis may play a role in interaction with SIGNR1. the deletion of the GlcNAc epitope in the waaL mutant reduced the ability of Y. pestis to interact with CHO-SIGNR1. Yersinia pestis KIM6 Lcr\u2013, Pgm+, Pst+, wild type (rough) (47) KIM10-ail Derivative of KIM5 in which the ail gene has been deleted. both plasmid pCD1 and pPCP1 have been cured. CS2429 Lacking both O-antigen and most of core (waaC) (50, 51) Cell lines Characteristics HeLa-NEO cells Control cell line, which expresses the neomycin resistance gene only CHO-SIGNR1 cells. a specific sugar epitope within core LPS may be responsible for interacting with SIGNR1. Y. pseudotuberculosis (Y1) were used as control strains. data are representative of three independent experiments. the interaction of the KIM10-ail and KIM10-ail-O+ with J774A.1 resembled the results obtained using primary macrophages. the CRL-2455 cell line, which does not express SIGNR1, is still able to phagocytose low levels of both KIM10-ail and KIM10-ail-O+. his-Mermaid is a newly identified DC-SIGN-like protein (56) that has previously been shown to inhibit the core-LPS-hDC-SIGN interaction (24) anti-CD66 antibody was employed as a control antibody. mannan, mannan, oligosaccharides, and lactoferrin were also used as control strains. 10-ail and Y. pseudotuberculosis sero-type O:1b (Y. pstb) data are representative of three independent experiments. Mermaid possesses the ability to inhibit hDC-SIGN-mediated interaction with several Gram-negative bacteria. but the inhibition of the Y. pestis-SIGNR1 interaction by Mermaid is limited. a higher percentage of viable Y. pestis was recovered compared to the O-antigen expressing-Y. pestis, KIM10-ail-O+. the increased recovery of KIM10-ail suggests that core LPS-mediated phagocytosis of Y. pestis occurs in vivo. plasmid pAY100.1 carries the O-Ag gene cluster of Y. enterocolitica serotype O:3 and produces the O-Ag (25, 27, 60, 61) y. pestis 1418 (KIM D27) is a conditionally virulent strain, which causes typical plague in mice. ail gene DNA of Y. pestis in LN, spleen and liver was quantitated by real time PCR. bacterial load was higher in mice infected with Y. pestis 1418 than in Y. pestis 1418-O+. culated in hind paws with Y. pestis 1418 or 1418-O+ transformed with the pXEN-luxCDABE (pXEN-18) plasmid. bioluminescence was detected in the abdomen and thoracic region of the mice at 48 hpi. highest level of signal was observed in the region corresponding to liver and spleen at 72 hpi. Y. pestis 1418 and 91001 were challenged with two sets of Y. pestis 1418 and 91001. survival analyses revealed that mice infected with Y. pestis 1418 suffered from a survival disadvantage compared to those infected with Y. pestis 1418-O+. Y. pseudotuberculosis strains possess an O-antigen, the production of which was lost by Y. pestis during evolution. the genes from the Y. pseudotuberculosis strains showed extreme diversity, which echoes the conclusion of the Cui's study. Y. pseudotuberculosis and Y. pestis strains show the multiple mutations of O-antigen synthesis genes. red cell indicates the gene was detectable in this strain. green cell indicates the gene was undetectable. ail-O+ and KIM10-ail-Core were examined for their ability to invade mouse macrophages. CS180 (rough), CS1861 (CS180 expressing an O-antigen, smooth) and CS2429 (deep rough) were used as controls. Y. pestis KIM10 (ail, ail-O+ and ail-Core) into purified mouse macrophages. CFDA-SE labeled and unlabelled bacteria indicated by open and filled symbols. macrophages from the mouse peritoneal cavity express SIGNR1. Y. pestis invades CHO-SIGNR1 but not other CHO transfectants. CHO transfectants were incubated with the bacterial strains for 2.5 h. extracellular bacteria were killed by 100 g/ml of gentamicin. es were examined for the rate of internalized bacteria. KIM10-ail-O+ was more resistant than KIM10-ail in serum resistant assay. Yersinia pestis KIM6 Lcr\u2013, Pgm+, Pst+, wild type (rough) (47) KIM10-ail Derivative of KIM5 in which the ail gene has been deleted. both plasmid pCD1 and pPCP1 have been cured. CS2429 Lacking both O-antigen and most of core (waaC) (50, 51) Cell lines Characteristics HeLa-NEO cells Control cell line. expresses the neomycin resistance gene only CHO-SIGNR1 cells. Y. pestis 1418 (D27, wild type) and its mutants. osis (Y1) was used as a control strain because it invades most epithelial cell lines, including CHO (43), via the invasin-integrin interaction (44, 45) osis (Y1) grown at 26\u00b0C was used as a positive control in this experiment because it invades most epithelial cell lines. macrophages from the mouse peritoneal cavity express SIGNR1. Y. pestis invades CHO-SIGNR1 but not other CHO transfectants. CHO transfectants were incubated with the bacterial strains for 2.5 h. extracellular bacteria were killed by 100 g/ml of gentamicin. the deletion of the GlcNAc epitope in the waaL mutant reduced the ability of Y. pestis to interact with CHO-SIGNR1. phagocytosis of the Y. pestis mutants by CHO-SIGNR1 was consistent with the idea that the lengthier the core LPS is, the greater the ability to promote phagocytosis. IM10-ail Derivative of KIM5 in which the ail gene has been deleted and both plasmid pCD1 and pPCP1 have been cured. plasmid pCD1 and pPCP1 have been cured. Y. pestis 1418 (D27, wild type, 5149 D27--waaE, 5150 D27--waaL, 5151 D27--waaL, 5151 D27--wabD, and 5188 D27--waaA) were used as control strains. Y. pestis invades certain macrophage cell lines, such as the J774A.1 (54, 55) the KIM10-ail and KIM10-ail-O+ were examined for their ability to invade two macrophage cell lines. the expression level of SIGNR1 on J774A.1 is shown in Figure 6B, but the expression of this receptor on CRL-2455 cell line was undetectable. the interaction of the KIM10-ail and KIM10-ail-O+ with J774A.1 resembled the results obtained using primary macrophages. the CRL-2455 cell line, which does not express SIGNR1, is still able to phagocytose low levels of both KIM10-ail and KIM10-ail-O+, but not CS180. anti-CD66 antibody was used as a control strain. mannan inhibits interaction between Y. pestis or CS180 and CHO-SIGNR1. inhibition of SIGNR1-mediated phagocytosis of Y. pestis. oligosaccharides inhibit the core-LPS-hDC-SIGN interaction of Y. pestis KIM10-ail very well (25). hDC-SIGN (hCD209a) and SIGNR1 (CD209b) are different in terms of their interactions with Y. pestis. a higher percentage of viable Y. pestis was recovered compared to the O-antigen expressing-Y. pestis, KIM10-ail-O+. the increased recovery of KIM10-ail suggests that core LPS-mediated phagocytosis of Y. pestis occurs in vivo. plasmid pAY100.1 carries the O-Ag gene cluster of Y. enterocolitica serotype O:3 and produces the O-Ag (25, 27, 60, 61) y. pestis 1418 (KIM D27) is a conditionally virulent strain, which is able to cause typical plague in mice. is 1418 and 1418-O+ with pXEN-18 were monitored by bioluminescence. bacterial load was higher in mice infected with Y. pestis 1418 than in Y. pestis 1418-O+ with pXEN-18. inescent signals were monitored at 0, 48, and 72 h post inoculation (hpi) the bioluminescent scale ranges from most intense (red) to least intensity (violet) all images are standardized to the same radiance scale. the highest level of signal was observed in the region corresponding to liver and spleen at 72 hpi. plasmid pAY100.1 carries the O-Ag gene cluster of Y. enterocolitica serotype O:3. y. pestis 1418 (KIM D27) is a conditionally virulent strain, which is able to cause typical plague in mice depending on the route of infection and dose. Y. pestis 1418 spread to lymph node in Y. pestis at 5 hpi. survival rates of WT mice and SIGNR1 KO mice after infection. log-rank test performed for each group. bioluminescence was detected in the abdomen and thoracic region of the mice at 48 hpi. highest level of signal was observed in the region corresponding to liver and spleen at 72 hpi. signal from the mice infected with Y. pestis 1418-O+ was significantly increased in intensity than those in Y. pestis1418 group. mice infected with Y. pestis 1418 suffered from a significant survival disadvantage compared to those infected with Y. pestis 1418-O+. Y. pestis 91001, a fully virulent strain isolated from china (62), was used to challenge each mouse with 30 CFU via subcutaneous inoculation. results show that the exposure of core LPS is important for Y. pestis in host dissemination and bacterial infection. Y. pestis uses its core LPS to interact with SIGNR1 in vitro. KO mice have been used successfully to identify viral receptors. KO mice have been used successfully to identify viral receptors. mouse CEACAM1 is a receptor for mouse hepatitis virus (67) there are no credible receptor knock-out models that are more resistant to bacterial infection. there are potential limitations of this approach to study bacterial-host cell interactions. lactoferrin, a small peptide from milk, and Lewis X components (oligosaccharides) have been shown to prevent DC-mediated HIV-1 transmission by blocking the DC-SIGN-gp120 interaction (73, 74). this study has demonstrated that some oligosaccharides indeed inhibit the interaction between Y. pestis and hDC-SIGN. a deep rough isogenic mutant CS2429 (waaC) was used to assess the role of LPS in bacterial-macrophage interactions. Yersinia pseudotuberculosis (Y1) is a serotype O:1a strain, lacking the virulence plasmid (pYV) and expression of Ail protein. Y. pestis core LPS mutants 5147, 5149, 5150, 5151, and 5188 were generously provided by Dr. Skurnik (46). the inner core structure contains KDO linked to lipid A followed by heptoses to which the outer core hexoses attach. plasmid pAY100.1 carries all the necessary genes for the expression of the O-ag of Y. enterocolitica serotype O:3 (60, 61) the expression of Y. pestis was lost during evolution from the ancestor, Y. pseudotuberculosis. CHO-Neo is the control cell line, which expresses the neomycin resistance gene only. cell lines were recently used for identification of core LPS from several Gram-negative bacteria as ligand for DC-SIGN receptor. mannan and lactoferrin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Mermaid is a DC-SIGN-like molecule expressed by the marine nematode Laxus oneistus. is strains and 8 Y. pestis strains were sequenced using high-fidelity DNA polymerase. first, these genes were copied by Polymerase Chain Reaction using high-fidelity DNA polymerase. then the products were sent to perform bidirectional Sanger sequencing. mouse abdomen was gently massaged for 3 min and lavage fluid was collected. suspension containing the macrophages was seeded in flasks and placed in a CO2 incubator for 2 h. cell layers were washed 3 times to remove non-adherent cells. cells were washed twice to remove the antibiotics. cells were suspended in PBS containing 0.5% saponin. the cells were plated on LB and GC plates. trypan blue blocks fluorescence but cannot penetrate host cells. the higher of the fluorescence-intensity shows, the more of bacteria are phagocytosed by macrophages. each well washed three times with RPMI with 2% FCS. Y. pestis were cultured at 26\u00b0C to avoid the expression of OPM capsule. then suspended in PBS at a concentration of OD600 = 1.5 in PBS. mice were euthanized and the inguinal lymph nodes were isolated 24 h post-injection. a deep rough isogenic mutant CS2429 (waaC) was used to assess the role of LPS in bacterial-macrophage interactions. yersinia pseudotuberculosis (Y1) is a serotype O:1a strain, lacking the virulence plasmid (pYV) and expression of Ail protein. KIM10-ail-O+ expresses an O-antigen from Y. enterocolitica serotype O:3 (61) is an isogenic derivative of KIM10-ail. outer core LPS has been deleted as described in construction procedures. pCBD41 contains two gmhA-flanking 900 bp PCR-amplified fragments cloned into suicide vector pCVD442 (78) the recovered KIM10-ail transconjugants should contain the plasmid cointegrated at the gmhA chromosomal locus. the deletion of gmhA was confirmed by PCR assays using the primers. mouse lectin tranfectants, CHO-mDC-SIGN, CHO-SIGNR1, CHO-SIGNR3, CHO-mDEC-205 (CD205) and CHO-mLangerin (CD207) were generated by transfecting CHO cells with human DC-SIGN cDNA followed by selection for stable surface DC-SIGN expression as originally described. CHO-Neo is the control cell line, which expresses the ne mannan and lactoferrin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. the background information of each oligosaccharide is listed in Sigma-Aldrich catalog. Mermaid is a DC-SIGN-like molecule expressed by the marine nematode Laxus oneistus. a recombinant form of Mermaid (His-Mermaid) was expressed and purified as described (56) a recombinant form of Mermaid was expressed and purified as described (56) wbyI Forward 5\u2032- TGTGTCAAGTTAGTCGGATATG-3\u2032, wbyI Reverse 5\u2032- CTTGCGAAGACCATTAG-3\u2032, and ddhB Reverse 5\u2032- CCAGCTCAGCAATCTGTTGAC-3\u2032. peritoneal macrophages were selected as our primary cells after the 6- to 8-week-old female mice were euthanized. the cells were allowed to incubate for 2.5 h (2 h for alveolar macrophages) at 37\u00b0C in the presence of 5% CO2. the cells were washed 3 times with RPMI containing 2% FCS. gentamicin, which kills extracellular bacteria but cannot penetrate host cells, was added into each well to a final concentration of 100 g/ml. bacteria were suspended in RPMI medium containing 5- and 6-carboxyfluorescein diacetate. labeled bacteria were added to macrophage cultures for 2 h. macrophages plus associated bacteria were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde. each well washed three times with RPMI with 2% FCS to remove non-adhered cells and lysed with saponin. each well washed three times with RPMI with 2% FCS to remove non-adhered cells and followed the same procedures as in vitro phagocytosis assays. the dissemination rate was defined as the transport of Y. pestis to LN, spleen, and liver. pestis 1418-O+ was transformed with the plasmid pXEN-18 which expresses the lux genes. the bioluminescence signal was detected by night OWL II LB983 imaging system."}
