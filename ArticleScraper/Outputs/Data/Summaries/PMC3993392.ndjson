{"summary": "induction of type I IFNs regulates expression of antiviral genes, including IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and IFN-regulated factors (IRFs) in response to viral infections, induction of type I IFNs regulates expression of antiviral genes. IFN- is essential for clearance of many intracellular bacterial infections. ability of type I IFNs to suppress IFN- signaling may contribute to bacterial pathogenesis. rickettsiae are a group of highly pathogenic emerging and reemerging bacteria. human monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME) is caused by the obligate intracellular pathogen Ehrlichia chaffeensis. in recent years, additional isolates have been identified. the impact of type I IFNs on ehrlichial pathogenesis has not been investigated. we first wanted to determine if type I IFNs were induced during ehrlichial infection. however, IFN- was not required for host defense to IOE infection. C57BL/6 mice and a CD45 congenic strain (B6.SJL-Ptprca/BoyAiTac) were purchased from Taconic (Petersburgh, NY) IFN-/ receptor gene (Ifnar1; referred to here as Ifnar)-knockout mice were provided by Jacob Kohlmeier and David Woodland. the number of bacterial copies was determined using a real-time quantitative probe-based PCR for the disulfide bond formation protein gene (dsb) the antibodies used for flow cytometry include: phycoerythrin (PE)-CD45.1 (A20), PB-CD4 (RM4-5), allophycocyanin (APC)-CD4 (GK1.5), fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-CD4 (GK1.5), tavidin (all from BioLegend, San Diego, CA), V500-CD45.2 (104) and FITC\u2013TNF- (MP6-XT22) were used as negative controls. unstained cells were used as negative controls to establish the flow cytometer voltage settings. data analysis was performed using an LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) cells were washed two times in wash/perm buffer, resuspended in simple wash buffer, and analyzed on an LSR II (BD Biosciences). FlowJo software (TreeStar Inc., Ashland, OR) Cytokine measurements. liver and lung were perfused with PBS before harvest. CD45 congenic mice were lethally irradiated and then received 5 106 BM cells from Ifnar-deficient mice. mice were screened for chimerism and infected with IOE at 8 to 10 weeks postreconstitution. IFN-/ receptor gene (Ifnar1; referred to here as Ifnar)-knockout mice were purchased from Taconic (Petersburgh, NY) all mice were bred in the Animal Resources Facility at Albany Medical College under specific-pathogen-free conditions. the number of bacterial copies was determined using a real-time quantitative probe-based PCR for the disulfide bond formation protein gene (dsb) the number of bacterial copies was determined using a real-time quantitative probe-based PCR for the disulfide bond formation protein gene (dsb) flow cytometric data were acquired using an LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) unstained cells were used as negative controls to establish the flow cytometer voltage settings, and single-color positive controls were used. cells were stained with a fixable viability dye (BD Biosciences) cell washed and then fixed and permeabilized in Fix/Perm buffer. cells were then incubated in wash/Perm buffer with fluorescence-conjugated anti-IFN- antibody, anti-IFN- antibody, or anti-TNF- antibody for 30 min on ice. ELISA substrate were purchased from BioLegend and Sigma. Cytokines in homogenates and sera were calculated as pg/mg of total protein and pg/ml. anti-IFN-, 80 g per day except 200 g at day 7. new antibodies to mouse IFN- (XMG1.2; Bio X cell) were administered into ifnar-deficient mice. type I IFN protein was measured in the spleen, liver, and liver. we found that IFN- was increased in spleen and liver, but not in the lung. IFN- was detected at increased concentrations in all three tissues. IFN- in the sera of IOE-infected WT, MyD88/, and TLR2/ mice at day 7 postinfection is shown. asterisks indicate a significant difference compared to the counterpart mock controls. at least three animals were used per group. FN-- or IFN--neutralizing antibody-treated mice showed slightly reduced bacterial burdens in the spleen and lung. mice treated with both anti-IFN- and anti-IFN- had significantly reduced bacterial burdens. survival was assessed and bacterial burden was measured in mice where type I IFN signaling was disrupted. IOE-infected mice exhibited two populations of IFN--positive cells in the spleen: Ly6C+ CD11b and Ly6C+ CD11b+ cells. the Ly6C+ CD11b cells expressed CD45, CD317 (PDCA-1), Siglec H, and B220. the Ly6C+ CD11b+ cells expressed CD115 and were F4/80+/, characteristic of monocytes. pDCs were characterized as Ly6C+ CD11b+ CD115+ F4/80+/. pDCs were characterized as Ly6C+ CD11b+ CD115+ F4/80+/. pDCs were characterized as Ly6C+ CD11b Siglec H+ CD11clo CD317+ B220lo. WT and Ifnar-deficient mice had similar frequencies of apoptotic and necrotic leukocytes, including T cells, B cells, NK cells, NKT cells, monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils. increased TNF--producing T cells were increased in the absence of IFN-R signaling during IOE infection. Ifnar-deficient mice had increased concentrations of IFN- in both serum and spleen during ehrlichial infection. CD4 T cells were the major IFN--producing cells in both WT mice and Ifnar-deficient mice during ehrlichial infection. absolute numbers of CD4+ IFN-+ T cells for each spleen are shown. numbers indicate a significant difference compared to mock controls. at least four animals were used for each group. pathogen-reactive IgM production in Ifnar-deficient mice required IFN- signaling. splenic plasmablasts (B220lo CD11clo) and serum Ehrlichia-specific IgM were measured at different time points post-IOE infection. the numbers above the gate represent the percentage of plasmablasts among all splenocytes. the numbers above the gate represent the percentage of plasmablasts among all splenocytes. IFN- and pathogen-specific IgM are not essential for host defense against IOE infection in the absence of IFN-R signaling. ifnar/ mice were treated with anti-IFN- or PBS every other day, beginning on day 2 post-IOE infection. WT hosts with an Ifnar-deficient hematopoietic system also had a slightly, but not significantly, higher concentration of serum IFN-. however, we noted that IFN- concentrations were significantly reduced in chimeric mice where the nonhematopoietic system was WT. survival curves for reverse chimeric mice during IOE infection are shown. serum IFN- and IFN- concentrations in reverse chimeric mice at day 8 postinfection are shown. number symbols indicate a significant difference between the groups. type I IFNs were undetectable in E. muris-infected mice. we found that IFN- was increased in spleen, liver, and liver. IFN- was detected at increased concentrations in all three tissues. IFN- concentration in the sera of IOE-infected WT mice at day 7 postinfection is shown. asterisks indicate a significant difference compared to the counterpart mock controls. at least three animals were used per group. IFN- or IFN--neutralizing antibody-treated mice showed slightly reduced bacterial burdens in the spleen and lung. mice treated with both anti-IFN- and anti-IFN- had significantly reduced bacterial burdens. pDCs and monocytes are the primary hematopoietic cells that produce IFN- during IOE infection. pDCs and monocytes are the primary hematopoietic cells that produce IFN- and pDCs are producers of IFN- during IOE infection. pDCs were characterized as Ly6C+ CD11b+ CD115+ F4/80+/. pDCs were characterized as Ly6C+ CD11b+ CD115+ F4/80+/. pDCs were characterized as Ly6C+ CD11b+ CD115+ F4/80+/. both CD4 and CD8 T cells produced more TNF- during IOE infection. TNF- can induce apoptosis during infection (52); thus, we compared apoptosis of leukocyte populations between WT and Ifnar-deficient mice during IOE infection. number symbols indicate a significant difference between WT and Ifnar/ mice (P 0.05). at least four animals were used for each group. IFN- has been shown to be protective during Ehrlichia infection (16, 34) FN- by CD4 T cells (gated on CD3+ CD4+ cells) in the spleens at day 7 postinfection are shown. asterisks indicate a significant difference compared to mock controls. at least four animals were used for each group. IFN- induces pathogen-specific IgM production during IOE infection. plasmablasts (B220lo CD11clo) and serum Ehrlichia-specific IgM were measured at different time points post-IOE infection as indicated. the numbers in the quadrants represent the percentage of WT or Ifnar/ cells among total splenic plasmablasts. the numbers above the gate represent the percentage of plasmablasts among splenocytes. IFN--dependent splenomegaly observed in Ifnar-deficient mice was abrogated by IFN- neutralization. increased survival in the absence of type I IFNs does not require increased IFN- or IgM. Ifnar-deficient hosts with a WT hematopoietic system survived significantly longer than WT hosts with an Ifnar-deficient hematopoietic system. chimeric mice with an Ifnar-deficient hematopoietic system also had a slightly, but not significantly, higher concentration of serum IFN-. IFN-R signaling in the nonhematopoietic system contributes significantly to host death during IOE infection. reverse chimeric mice (WT BM to Ifnar/ recipients and Ifnar/ BM to WT recipients, respectively) were generated and infected with IOE. IFN-R-mediated signaling in nonhematopoietic system contributed significantly to death during IOE infection. mice die of a toxic shock-like syndrome characterized by extensive liver damage and interstitial pneumonitis (27) increased Ang2 is observed in anthrax (59), dengue hemorrhagic fever (60) and severe malaria, all diseases associated with vascular dysfunction and induction of type I IFNs. this finding illustrates the requirement of type I IFNs in driving shock-like disease. type I IFNs are produced constitutively at low levels (2). expression can be triggered during infection by pathogen-associated molecular patterns. bacterial pathogens elicit type I IFN production via bacterial ligands. pathogens are Brucella abortus (66), Listeria monocytogenes (67), and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (68). pDCs and monocytes produce both IFN- and IFN- during IOE infection. it is not yet clear whether type I IFNs are elicited during IOE infection due to direct pathogen recognition. the precise mechanisms by which type I IFNs participate in severe disease require further study. the precise mechanisms by which type I IFNs participate in severe disease require further study."}
