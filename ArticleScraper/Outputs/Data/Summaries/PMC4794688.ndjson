{"summary": "virologists have traditionally depended on propagation of both host and virus in culture for virus discovery and characterization. development of viral metagenomics breaks this dependence on culture-based methods but often results in only fragmented viral genome sequences. restriction factor TRIM5 inhibits retroviral infection by recognizing incoming viral cores and promoting their disassembly. autophagic degradation is thought to be required for TRIM5 restriction of retroviral infection by TRIM5. envelope glycoprotein-based DNA vaccines in rabbits can elicit potent neutralizing antibodies that target several arenaviruses. guinea pigs protected against lethal infection by GTOV and by JUNV."}
