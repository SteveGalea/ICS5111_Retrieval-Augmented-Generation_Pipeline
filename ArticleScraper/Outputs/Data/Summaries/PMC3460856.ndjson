{"summary": "virus encodes for two surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), the proton pump transmembrane protein (M2), the matrix protein (M1), the nuclear export protein (NS2/NEP), the nonstructural protein (NS1) and, in some influenza viruses (from an alternative translation start site in segment 1) the PB1-F2, an apoptosis modulatory protein [6]\u2013[8]. a pol1 terminator sequence (t1) or a hepatitis ribozyme have been used to generate the exact 5\u2032 end. a system that does not rely on cloning could speed up studies on the significance of mutations in the viral genome for replication. the proportion of green cells observed was comparable to those observed in positive control cells co-transfected with pHW72-EGFP and the 3P and NP expression plasmids. the fluorescence signal of another amplicon, pol1EGFPutr, was present in fewer cells compared to the pol1EGFPt1 amplicon. as expected, no fluorescence signal appeared when cells were transfected with a Flu GFP PCR amplicon lacking the Flu PCR amplicons are amplified by the method described in the supplemental information. the amplicons were amplified by the method described in the supplemental information. the strategy speeds up the reverse genetics process by obviating a classical cloning step. pol2PB2bgh, pol2PB1bgh, pol2PAbgh, and pol2NPbgh were obtained using a set of primers spanning the cytomegalovirus promoter (CMV) and bovine growth hormone (bgh) polyA elements. PCR amplicons with either pol1 or pol2 transcription elements are appropriately transcribed by the corresponding transcription complexes. the strains mouse-adapted A/Cal pol1HApdmt1 and polNA072t1 PCR amplicons were generated from viral cDNAs. full-length HA and NA PCR amplicons were generated lacking either the t1 sequence or both the pol1 and t1 sequences. the strategy was based on amplification of the pol1 promoter from the pDP2002 vector. length pol1HApdmt1 PCR amplicon was prepared using primer pair pT1FragFwd and hPol1Rev. alternative PCR products were generated to serve as controls for reverse genetics. pol1HApdmt1 and polNA 072 t1 amplicons were prepared following the strategy described above. at 48 h and 72 h post-transfection (hpt) cells co-transfected with pol1HApdmt1 PCR amplicon plus 7 RG PR8 plasmids (H1pdm:7PR8) showed typical virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) at 72 hpt, virus titers increased >107 TCID50/ml with either the pol1HApdm PCR amplicon or the pRF1437 plasmid (Table 1).

PCR amplicons were prepared and designated as pol1HApdmutr or pol1NApdmutr. amplicons for HA and NA lacking both the pol1 and t1 signals were prepared and used as controls. each virus segment was amplified to generate a full set of flu PCR amplicons encoding each one of the viral segments. the optimal cocktail consisted of polPB1PR8t1 (1 g), polPB2PR8t1 (1 g), polPAPR8t1 (1 g), polNPPR8t1 (1 g), polHApdmt1 (0.5 g), polNApdmt1 (0.5 g), polMPR gh amplicons in a reaction including 12 PCR amplicons and no plasmids (Table S1, 4PCR:4PR8 virus), resulted in efficient virus rescue. the PCR-based strategy is not limited to just the viral surface genes and it could be easily applied to other gene segments. HA PCR amplicons were prepared carrying the canine pol1 promoter (k9pol1) and termination signals (k9t1) both HA genes were amplified using overlapping PCRs that removed the gene's polybasic cleavage site sequences. virus rescue was also possible in MDCK cells. reassortant viruses HA072:7VN1203 and HAVN1203:7VN1203 resulted in no virus rescue. k9pol1 and k9t1 sequences rescued with the VN1203 backbone in MDCK cells. reassortant viruses HA072:7VN1203 and HAVN1203:7VN1203 resulted in impaired virus rescue. a PCR product was produced encoding the GFP reporter gene in negative orientation flanked by the influenza segment 7 untranslated regions (UTRs) co-transfection of the pol1EGFPt1 amplicon along with 4 protein expression plasmids encoding the influenza virus polymerase complex (3P) and NP into 293T cells resulted in efficient amplification of the reporter replicon and detection of green fluorescence signal. PCR-based Flu reporter replicon encoding GFP was performed using primers spanning the pol1 to t1 sequences and pHW72EGFP. expression of GFP reflects influenza polymerase activity on a vRNA Flu GFP replicon generated from pol1 transcription of the flu virus amplicon. pol2PB2bgh, pol2PB1bgh, pol2PAbgh, and pol2NPbgh amplicons were amplified by the method described in the supplemental information. PCR amplicons of the 3P and NP genes were obtained using a set of primers spanning the cytomegalovirus promoter (CMV) and bovine growth hormone (bgh) polyA elements. the pol1HApdmt1 PCR amplicon carried a full-length copy of the HA gene from the H1N1pdm strain flanked by the pol1 and t1 signals. similar strategies were followed to create the NA amplicons pol1HApdmt1 and polNA072t1 from viral cDNAs. agarose gel electrophoresis combined in equal proportions (10 ng each) to create full-length pol1HApdmt1 PCR amplicons using primers pT1FragFwd and polFragRev. the three PCR products above were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and combined in equal proportions (10 ng each) polHA 072 t1 (lane 1) and polNA 072 t1 (lane 3) amplicons were prepared following the strategy described above and depicted in B) and D) all the PCR products were amplified here and in the supplemental information. pol1HA072t1 HA PCR amplicon and 7 RG PR8 plasmids could be rescued. at 72 hpt, the TICD50 titer of the PCR-based H5072:7PR8 virus was 10, 000 times less than that of pH5072:7PR8 virus. pdmutr:7PR8b UTRHApdmutr PR8/7 0 0 (M); 0 (E) H1pdm:7WF10 pol1HApdmt1 WF10/7 1.58106 Not Done pH1pdm:7WF10 - pH1pdm/1, WF10/7 2.32106 Not Done H5072:7WF10 pol1HA072t1 WF10/7 1.58106 58105 2.32107 (M) H5072N1:6PR8 pol1HA072t1/pol1NA072t1 PR8/6 1.58104 5.00108 (E) 6+2 H1N1pdmutr:6PR8 UTRHApdmutr/UTRNApdmutr PR8/6 0 0 (M); 0 (E) H1N1pdm:6WF10 pol1HApdmt1/pol1NA 0+12 12PCR (PR8) pol1HApdmt1/pol1NSPR8t1/pol1PB2PR8t1/pol1PAPR8t1/pol1NPPR8t1 PR8/4 1.58102 1.08106 (E) a utr: Viruses obtained when Flu PCR amplicons lacked the pol 1 promoter sequence. no CPE and no virus was detected after transfection of cells with 7 RG PR8 plasmid each virus isolate from the H5072:7PR8 virus group contained a monobasic cleavage site identical to the one designed in the PCR primers. mutations caused amino acids changes in 3 of them; however, these changes did not alter the antigenic make up of these viruses by HI assay. positive viral antigen green signal detected using mAb 3B2 in cells infected with either the H1N1pdmutr:6PR8 or H1N1pdm:6PR8 viruses. mAb DPJY01 specific to H5N1 virus has no reaction with PR8-infected cells (X20) pol1HApdmt1 or pol1HA072t1 HA PCR amplicons were obtained with either pol1HApdmPCR:7WF10 or pol1HA072t1 HA PCR amplicons. virus titers increased significantly, about 1,000 fold for the H5072:7WF10 virus. reassortants H1N1pdm:6AA60ca and HApdm:7AA60ca were rescued from the 072 strain using the amplicons pol1HA 072 t1 and pol1NA072t1 co-transfected with either the PR8, WF10, or AA60ca backgrounds. reassortant viruses carrying 7 gene segments from either the PR8, WF10 or AA60ca encode a N2 NA subtype cells, virus titers of these reassortants increased although they were 1030 fold lower than those obtained with the full-length t1 signal-containing amplicons. each virus segment was amplified to generate a full set of flu PCR amplicons encoding each one of the viral segments. titer of 1.58102 TCID50 after 72 hpt with no detectable HA titer. blind passage in MDCK cells, resulted in virus titers in order of 1106 TCID50/ml with an HA titer of 128. PCR amplicons were used to replace corresponding plasmids. ed in virus rescue that was observed at 120 hpt (102 TCID50/ml) with about 500 fold lower efficiency compared to the whole plasmid-based system. ed in virus rescue with H1N1pdm PCR amplicons in vero cells. HA PCR amplicons were prepared carrying the canine pol1 promoter (k9pol1) and termination signals (k9t1) both HA genes were amplified using overlapping PCRs that removed the gene's polybasic cleavage site sequences. reassortant viruses HA072:7VN1203 and HAVN1203:7VN1203) resulted in virus rescue. a significant modification was introduced to the plasmid-based reverse genetics system [25], [26] for influenza based on PCR amplicons. a strategy involving overlapping PCR fragments for each segment was designed and used in conjunction with a high fidelity polymerase and corresponding buffer. this enzyme performed the best in our hands, compared to seven other commercially available DNA polymerases (Supplementary materials and methods S1) the amount obtained in each reaction for full length flu PCR amplicons was in the order of 15 g. this is comparable to the amount of plasmid DNA used for transfection in the conventional plasmid-based RG system. a low mutation rate was observed with approximately 8% of the plaque-purified viruses having a single nucleotide mutation. the PCR-based approach will be most likely better represent the virus population present in the original virus isolated compared to the plasmid-based system. the results show that the presence of the t1 signal at the 3\u2032 end of the flu PCR amplicon greatly improved virus rescue efficiency, approximately 100\u2013200 fold. the PCR-based system may produce a more variable virus population than the one obtained using the plasmid-based system. the sequencing of reassortants produced in this study does not show mutations that would alter the antigenicity of the HA surface proteins. the implications of the PCR-based approach for vaccine development are highly significant. a RG system for influenza was developed that does not require a cloning step for recovery of viruses. it has profound implications for vaccine development, pandemic preparedness, and for the study of influenza viruses. a reverse genetics clone was grown from a reverse genetics clone obtained from Peter Palese. human embryonic kidney cell-line 293T (HEK293T) were cultured in Opti-MEM I (GIBCO, Grand Island, NY) containing 5% FBS. the RG 8-plasmid system for the PR8 virus was produced from the homologous strain provided to us by Ruben Donis, CDC. the bidirectional pGD2007 vector containing the canine pol1 and t1 sequences was a gift from Ruben Donis. cDNAs were stored at 80\u00b0C until use.
