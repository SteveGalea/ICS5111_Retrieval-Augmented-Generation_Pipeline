{"summary": "this study is to explore the effectiveness of anti-C5a-based intervention on systemic inflammatory responses induced by paraquat poisoning. the neutralizing antihuman C5a antibody (IFX-1) was administered to investigate the new treatment strategy for paraquat-induced systemic inflammatory responses. serum and plasma samples from patients (n = 16) were collected prospectively within 2 hours after admission. samples from healthy control donors (n = 20) were recruited using the same protocols. written informed consent obtained from all subjects. measurements of inflammatory cytokines in serum were performed using ELISA kits (U-CyTech Biosciences, Utrecht, The Netherlands; Uscn Life Sciences, Houston, TX; or eBioscience, Austria, respectively) the analysis of C3c deposition and expression of C3a receptor (C3aR), C5a receptor (C5aR), CD68, myeloperoxidase, surfactant protein A (SP-A) and vascular endo Cynomolgus monkeys were assigned to treatment and sham treatment groups. both received an intraperitoneal injection of paraquat diluted in 5 mL of saline. sham treatment group received an IV injection of phosphate buffered saline. receptor (C5aR), CD68, myeloperoxidase, surfactant protein A (SP-A) and vascular endothelial-cadherin were detected by immunohistochemistry staining. the relative expression of VE-cadherin was analyzed using the 2\u2013CT method (29) the concentrations of C5a (p 0.01) and C5b-9 (p 0.001) in paraquat patients were significantly higher than those in healthy donors. clinical data indicated that paraquat ingestion contributes to acute inflammatory responses, which is closely associated with aberrant complement activation. Fig. 2A, Supplemental Digital Content 4, http://links.lww.com/CCM/D162; legend, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/CCM/D159). at 6 hours, the serum concentrations of interleukin (IL)\u20131, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u2013, IP-10, and MCP-1 were marked higher than those in control animals. IFX-1 improves paraquat-induced clinical signs in Cynomolgus macaques. we compared hemograms, C-reactive protein (CRP), ALT, BUN, CRE concentrations, and the prothrombin time (PT) in IFX-1\u2013treated cynomolgus macaques at 16 hours post paraquat administration. IFX-1 reduces systemic inflammatory responses in cynomolgus macaques with paraquat (PQ)\u2013induced acute lung injury. IFX-1 also caused a significant reduction in serum IL-1, IL-6, TNF-, and MCP-1. IFX-1 reduces inflammatory responses in lung tissue in cynomolgus macaques with paraquat (PQ)\u2013induced acute lung injury. results showed that paraquat administration led to a marked increase in myeloperoxidase- and CD68-positive cells in the lung at 16 hours. lungs of cynomolgus macaques receiving IFX-1 were cardinal red with hemorrhagic alveolar damage in microscopic observation. lungs of sham-treated cynomolgus macaques were cardinal red with hemorrhagic alveolar damage in microscopic observation. IFX-1 treatment increased expression of SP-A, suggesting it may help protect alveolar epithelial cells. expression and transcription level of VE-cadherin increased significantly at 16 hours post IFX-1 treatment (p 0.01). anti-C5a treatment also effectively ameliorated damage to organs including the spleen. normal human blood was incubated with plasma from PQ patients. IFX-1 inhibits up-regulation of CD11b expression. some patients were sent to hospital 2 or 3 hours after poisoning. patients showed evidence of ALI, which included advanced changes to the air spaces in the lung lobes on chest CT. elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines and abnormal laboratory readings suggested systemic inflammatory responses and multiple -organ damage. cynomolgus macaque model of paraquat-induced ALI was established. monkeys showed typical ALI characteristics, including scattered hyperemia, thickened alveolar septa, and infiltration of inflammatory cells. IFX-1 improves paraquat-induced clinical signs in Cynomolgus macaques. we compared hemograms, C-reactive protein (CRP), ALT, BUN, CRE concentrations, and the prothrombin time (PT) in cynomolgus macaques at 16 hours post paraquat administration. IFX-1 shortened the PT (p 0.05) indicating that the antibody also inhibited the coagulation cascade. coagulation abnormality has been suggested as one of the prognostic factors for ALI/acute respiratory distress syndrome. interleukin (IL)\u20131, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u2013, interferon-gamma-inducible protein (IP)-10, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 in serum from IFX-1\u2013treated monkeys. lungs of cynomolgus macaques in sham treatment group were cardinal red. lungs of cynomolgus macaques receiving IFX-1 were lighter shade. ifx-1 treatment ameliorates pathology associated with paraquat. the lungs of cynomolgus macaques were cardinal red with hemorrhagic alveolar damage in microscopic observation. those in IFX-1\u2013treated animals were a lighter shade with less severe damage. IFX-1 treatment increased expression of SP-A suggesting it may help protect alveolar epithelial cells. paraquat-treated cynomolgus macaques were incubated in the presence/absence of IFX-1. the results indicated that anti-C5a treatment alleviated tissue damage. IFX-1 effectively inhibits up-regulation of CD11b expression. a mouse model of paraquat-induced ALI showed strong activation of the complement system, resulting in tissue damage (12). this suggests that targeting complement activation might be a promising therapeutic approach to ALI induced by chemical agents. IFX-1 reduced the number of inflammatory cell infiltrating in lung, as well as levels of CRP, BUN, ALT and IL-1, TNF-, IL-6, thereby reducing injury to the lung, spleen, kidney, and intestine. evidence indicates that therapeutic modulation of C5a or C5 is a promising treatment for inflammatory disorders (43) IFX-1 provides effective and specific blockade of C5a without disturbing the C5b assembly arm required for MAC formation. this may play an important role in host defense against secondary bacterial and fungal pneumonia that typically occurs in patients who suffer from ALI. blockade of C5a using a neutralizing anti-C5a antibody IFX-1 significantly alleviated the systemic inflammatory responses and associated ALI. treatment of paraquat-induced ALI with IFX-1 may be potential clinical application and may also have clinical utility for those suffering from ALI induced by other chemical poisoning."}
