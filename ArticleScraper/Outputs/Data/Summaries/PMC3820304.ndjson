{"summary": "a patient with recurrent cough and wheeze presents to the clinic for evaluation. the patient states that the only time she has respiratory symptoms is fall, winter, and spring following \u201ccolds\u201d she denies she has asthma and does not feel the need to take steroids even though she has been prescribed them in the past. replication of human rhinovirus (RV), the most prevalent respiratory virus, was temperature restricted, with optimal growth below body temperature, at 33\u00b0\u201335\u00b0C. the most common explanation was that nasal blockage and mouth breathing lead to inspiration of cold, dry, and unfiltered air, triggering an asthma attack. adults seem to show a slightly lower prevalence of viral infection during exacerbations. 22 to 64% of patients with COPD exacerbations have virus identified by PCR versus 12 to 19% of nonexacerbating subjects. researchers infected adult control and asthmatic subjects with RV16. staining was clearly seen in the cytoplasm of cells in the epithelium. however, staining was patchy and in some samples only 1 or 2 cells were positive. sputum of experimentally infected controls and adults showed persistence of viral RNA up to 14 days after infection. patients with asthma who had an exacerbation had higher levels of viral RNA in their sputum compared to asthmatics that did not experience an exacerbation. a recent study by Proud and colleagues examined the effect of experimental rhinovirus infection on nasal epithelial cell gene expression in situ. the most highly upregulated genes were those encoding chemokines (CCL2, CCL8, CXCL11, CXCL10, CXCL13, CXCL9, and CCL20). we have obtained similar results in the lungs of RV-infected mice. airway epithelial damage and mucus metaplasia may provide rhinovirus with increased access to more readily infected basal cells [58] and goblet cells [59], thereby increasing viral replication. interferon responses, which have been shown to affect respiratory viral infections in animal models, may also be deficient in patients with asthma. two groups have failed to show reduced interferon responses in cultured airway epithelial cells from subjects with asthma [66, 67]. a difference in viral copy number or titer between controls and asthmatics has not been demonstrated following experimental RV infection [35]. RV16, a major group virus commonly used for experimental human infection, and RV1 are closely related. at this time, the only cell type conclusively shown to be infected by RV in humans is the airway epithelial cell. dsRNA produced during viral infection represents an important stimulus for the host innate immune response. vRNA approximately 24 hours after infection and negative-strand vRNA indicating viral replication. mice infected with UV-irradiated replication-deficient virus showed modest airway inflammation and responsiveness one, but not four days after infection. mice infected with rhinovirus showed modest airway inflammation and responsiveness one, but not four days after infection. mice were sensitized with ovalbumin (OVA) and alum given intraperitoneally. this followed by intranasal challenge with additional ovalbumin. one day after the last OVA challenge, animals were infected with RV1B. bronchoalveolar lavage macrophages from control and ovalbumin-sensitized and -challenged mice showed ample Th1 cytokine (TNF-, IL-12p70) expression in response to RV infection, but decreased Th1 responses. cytokine expression was consistent with a change in phenotype from M1 to alternatively activated M2 macrophages. mice receiving clodronate showed reduced levels of CCL11, eosinophils, IL-13, and airways responsiveness. the production of Th2 cytokines by lung macrophages is consistent with recent work showing that, in addition to Th2 helper T cells, innate immune cells may contribute to the production of Th2 cytokines in asthma. boosting of the immune response with interferons might be helpful. we infected mice with defects in TLR and MDA-5 [89] molecules. these signaling pathways are responsible for double-stranded RNA-stimulated interferon production. the key trigger for COPD is cigarette smoke rather than aeroallergens, air pollutants, or infection. in COPD, macrophages and CD8-positive cell play key roles rather than Th2 cells, eosinophils, or mast cells. the lower airways of 25 to 50% of patients with COPD are colonized by bacteria. PD patients experimentally infected with RV show increased sputum viral copy number versus controls. sputum neutrophils and interleukin-8 levels correlate with sputum neutrophils. these results provide ample evidence of altered innate immunity against viruses. data from a birth cohort of high-risk infants with a positive family history of asthma have shown that wheezing-associated illness with RV is the most important risk factor for asthma development. the relative risk of asthma development in infants with wheezing associated with rhinovirus infection was far higher than that of infants with allergen sensitization or RSV infection alone. studies using neutralizing antibody and an IL-4 receptor knockout mouse showed that the effect of RV was dependent on IL-13. we also found increased production of IL-13 by invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells. the notion that early rhinovirus infection could modulate future immune responses, leading to allergic airway inflammation. disease exacerbation in asthmatics may be explained in part by infection of airway inflammatory cells. viral-induced COPD exacerbations are associated with increased airway neutrophils, eosinophils, and lymphocytes."}
