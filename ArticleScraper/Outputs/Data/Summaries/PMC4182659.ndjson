{"summary": "influenza viruses are members of the Orthomyxoviridae family. they have a negative-polarity RNA genome segmented into eight (type A and B) or seven (type C) single-stranded molecules. type C virus has a unique envelope glycoprotein (HEF) whereas type A and B viruses have two (HA and NA) [1]. the total length of the NC sequences of each segment of influenza A and C viruses is very variable and depends on the non conserved sequence length. the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 NC sequences are 45 and 23 nt long for type A and 29 and 102 nt long for type C influenza viruses, respectively. within each genomic RNA molecule, the NC ends form secondary structures. the mutations introduced by site-directed mutagenesis are shown in boxes. the sequence of both ends of each segment of each rescued virus was verified as described [9] and no mutation was detected. the energy barrier of the canonical pairs CG and UA and of the wobble base pair GU were used to calculate a score to evaluate the panhandle strengths. nt for the 3\u2032 end of both types A and C, and 26 and 47 nt for the 5\u2032 end of type A and C, respectively. we showed for the NS segment that a homotypic proximal panhandle was necessary to obtain infectious influenza A or C viruses by reverse genetics. point mutations to restore a type A proximal panhandle were insufficient to rescue recombinant viruses. the strength of the initial distal panhandle was also affected in A2, A3 and A4. only the virus with type A 3\u2032 end was rescued (A8), but with a dramatically lower efficiency. no virus was rescued when the strength of the initial distal panhandle was reverted to that of A6 while maintaining the short 5\u2032 end (construct A11) no virus was rescued when the strength of the initial distal panhandle was reverted to that of A6 while maintaining the short 5\u2032 end (construct A11) no virus was rescued for construct A9. distal panhandles were required to initiate transcription and replication [23] minireplicon assays using the same plasmids used for reverse genetics to generate vRNA templates showed that transcription and replication levels were only slightly affected for A16 and A13 constructs. we speculate that impaired transcription/replication processes of the NP segment might not be the main obstacle to reverse genetics recovery. the reverse genetics plasmid of interest was used to reconstruct functional vRNP. mRNA and viral vRNA were quantified by RT-qPCR. results are expressed as fold changes calculated compared to wt construct mean. a reduction of 22 or 41 nt (leading to 80 and 61 nt long 5\u2032 ends, respectively) in C1 and C3 constructs had no effect on recovery efficiency. a reduction of 22 or 41 nt (leading to 80 and 61 nt long 5\u2032 ends) in C1 and C3 constructs had no effect on recovery efficiency. growth abilities of the type A virus with a long 5\u2032 end (A8) were reduced compared to that of viruses with a short 5\u2032 end (A1 and A10). type C viruses with a long 5\u2032 end (C1 and C3) grew better than those with a short one (C9 and C12) growth abilities of A8, A16, C9 and C12 highlighted the discrepancy that might be observed between the possibility to obtain a virus by reverse genetics and the fitness of the then-obtained virus. on the contrary, A16, with similar initial characteristics, seemed to have gained fitness through a single mutation. the mRNA 3\u2032UTR of cellular mRNAs has a critical role in gene expression regulation. it could regulate every steps of translation (initiation, elongation and termination) through different mechanisms involving RNA-binding proteins, micro-RNAs or the \u2018closed-loop\u2019 structure formed by the mRNA 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs. itometry quantification of viral protein band densities was performed for three independent replicates using GeneTools software. the values were used to calculate the mean ( SD) NP/NS1 ratios for each virus. NP would play a major role in the replication of the virus genome. vRNA and mRNA levels for each segment were evaluated by two-step RT-qPCRs previously described. results are expressed as the Cp-mRNA/Cp-vRNA ratios and are the mean ( SD) of two independent infections. the role of the initial distal panhandle for the NP segment highlighted the differences that exist between the different genomic segments. the length of the 5\u2032 NC region of type A NP segment seems to be involved in the translation regulation at the mRNA level. the series of eight or seven plasmids were subcloned in pHMG vector. plasmids were constructed by PCR using primers containing the total 3\u2032 or 5\u2032 NC sequence of the respective NP segment, followed by cloning. the sequences of the primers will be provided upon request. plasmids were mixed, then incubated at room temperature for 15 min. the DNA and the transfection reagent were then added to the cells. the cells were incubated at 35\u00b0C or 33\u00b0C for type A and type C viruses. agarose overlay contained complete DMEM with additional TPCK-trypsin at 1 or 0.5 g/ml for type A or C, respectively. overlaid cells were incubated at 35\u00b0C for 3 days or at 33\u00b0C for 5 days for type A or C. dm09 or PR8 expression protein plasmids were extracted in presence of 0.1 ng of NP constructs. total RNAs were reverse transcribed using the 3\u2032 universal primer. the cDNAs were used as templates for quantitative PCR (qPCR) qPCRs were performed with segment-specific primers [48] using a lightCycler 480 (Roche) PCR machine. the relative amounts of vRNAs and mRNAs were estimated by calculating the ratio mRNA/vRNA using the crossing point values (Cp) plasmids were constructed using primers containing the total 3\u2032 or 5\u2032 NC sequence of the respective NP segment, followed by cloning. cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 5%, 10% and 10% fetal calf serum. all cells were grown at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. plasmid based reverse genetics systems were used to produce recombinant viruses. agarose overlay contained 0.5 g/ml or 0.25 g/ml of TPCK-trypsin. the cells were incubated at 35\u00b0C or 33\u00b0C for type A or C. the supernatants were collected for virus titration in plaque assay. Viral genomic RNA was extracted using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen) from 140 l of culture supernatant following the manufacturer's recommendations. the RNA was eluted in 60 l of RNase-free water, and the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 NC regions were amplified by RT-PCR. western blot MDCK cells infected at an m.o.i. of 2 with the studied influenza A viruses were collected at six hours post-infection. at six hours post-infection, total RNAs were extracted."}
