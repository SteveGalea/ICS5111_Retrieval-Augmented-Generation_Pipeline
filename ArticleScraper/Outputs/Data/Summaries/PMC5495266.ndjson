{"summary": "env gene structure of PR-RSV-C passaged twice through rodents. first passage was done in rats, generating the XC-RSV provirus. second passage was done in hamsters, yielding the H20-RSV provirus. h and vr regions in SU are depicted in gray boxes. FP, HR1, HR2, and MSD in TM are shown in white boxes. the eight amino acid substitutions found in the rodent-passaged H20-RSV did not match the already described mutations responsible for the ASLV extended host range. env gene in the RCAS-EnvC-GFP vector originates from PR-RSV-C. env gene in the RCAS-EnvH20-GFP vector originates from H20-RSV. a sharp two-log decrease in viral DNA level was observed. chimeric reporter vector RCAS-EnvH20-GFP prepared from virus containing EnvC or EnvH20 was scored by flow cytometry 3 d later. the limit of detection (signal from uninfected NIL cells) is marked with a dashed line. mutations in the first part of SU (D23G) and in the fusion peptide (L378S) are responsible for the virus-extended host range. mutations in the first part of SU (D23G) and in the fusion peptide (L378S) are responsible for the virus-extended host range. the mutation in the fusion peptide played a decisive role in the increased NIL cell infectivity. the mutation in the fusion peptide played a decisive role in the increased NIL cell infectivity. both mutations can separately facilitate entry into hamster cells. the D32G mutation had a very mild effect (construct EnvC-H20Part1). mutation in the fusion peptide (construct EnvC-H20Part4, L378S) was almost as effective as the entire H20 env gene. RT activity of RCAS-EnvC and RCAS-EnvH20-GFP was measured using the PERT assay described in SI Materials and Methods. results are presented as titers relative to RCAS-EnvC-GFP. TM was detected by immunoblotting with an antibody against its C-terminal part. samples were neutralized, lysed in Laemmli loading buffer. samples were analyzed by SDS/PAGE without boiling. it has been shown that a virus activated by a soluble receptor is very unstable at low pH (23) therefore, we tested RCAS-EnvH20-GFP and discovered that it behaved similarly to a receptor-primed virus. it was almost completely inactivated by low-pH treatment, in contrast to RCAS-EnvC-GFP, which remained stable at low pH. we compared the ability of EnvC and EnvH20 to form TM oligomers at neutral pH and low pH at room temperature. however, EnvH20 behaves like an Env in the receptor-primed state and has a conformation that enables the triggering of TM oligomerization by low pH. maleimide group reacts specifically with reduced thiols to form stable thioether bonds. it has been shown that receptor priming induces formation of reactive thiolate in SU. the virus becomes prone to PMB inhibition when incubated with a soluble receptor. purified viruses harboring EnvC-H20 chimeras were incubated at 37 \u00b0C 30 min before infection of DF-1 cells. titers were determined by flow cytometry 2 d later. human cells almost as efficiently as the virus with TM-H20 and SU-C (EnvC-H20Part4). TM mutation found in EnvH20 causes Env activation and enables mammalian cell infection even when combined with SU-B. this supports our hypothesis that extended host range is due to Env activation. retroviral RSV env Enable Virus Entry into Hamster Cells. env gene structure of PR-RSV-C passaged twice through rodents. first rodent passage was done in rats, generating XC-RSV provirus. second passage was done in hamsters, yielding the H20-RSV provirus. h and vr regions in SU are depicted in gray boxes. FP, HR1, HR2, and MSD in TM are shown in white boxes. the eight amino acid substitutions found in the rodent-passaged H20-RSV did not match the already described mutations responsible for the ASLV extended host range. env gene in the RCAS-EnvC-GFP vector originates from PR-RSV-C. env gene in the RCAS-EnvH20-GFP vector originates from H20-RSV. a sharp two-log decrease in viral DNA level was observed. chimeric reporter vector RCAS-EnvH20-GFP prepared from RCAS-EnvC-GFP and H20-RSV virus. infection of NIL and NIL-Tvc cells with RCAS-GFP viruses containing EnvC or EnvH20 was scored by flow cytometry 3d later. mutations in the first part of SU (D23G) and in the fusion peptide (L378S) are responsible for the virus-extended host range. mutations in the first part of SU (D23G) and in the fusion peptide (L378S) are responsible for the virus-extended host range. the mutation in the fusion peptide played a decisive role in the increased NIL cell infectivity. the data was presented as a ratio of NIL/NIL-Tvc infection. both mutations can separately facilitate entry into hamster cells. the virus with EnvH20 was able to enter these cells with an efficiency of two orders of magnitude higher over the limit of detection. the D32G mutation had a very mild effect, whereas the fusion peptide was almost as effective as the entire H20 env gene. RT activity of RCAS-EnvC and RCAS-EnvH20-GFP was measured using the PERT assay described in SI Materials and Methods. results are presented as titers relative to RCAS-EnvC-GFP. similar titers were incubated with low (pH 5) or neutral (pH 7.5) treatment at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min before infection of DF-1 cells. titers were determined by flow cytometry 2 d later. a virus activated by a soluble receptor is very unstable at low pH. a biochemical assay was used to test the oligomeric state of the ASLV Env TM subunit. it has been shown that a virus activated by a soluble receptor is very unstable at low pH (23) EnvH20 behaves like an Env in the receptor-primed state and has a conformation that enables the triggering of TM oligomerization by low pH. in both cases, a certain amount of TM oligomers formed at neutral pH; however, EnvH20 TM oligomerization was clearly stronger following low pH treatment. the maleimide group reacts specifically with reduced thiols to form stable thioether bonds. it has been shown that receptor priming induces formation of reactive thiolate in SU. the virus becomes prone to PMB inhibition when incubated with a soluble receptor. level of Env activation correlates with the efficiency of receptor-independent entry. purified viruses harboring EnvC-H20 chimeras were incubated at 37 \u00b0C 30 min before infection of DF-1 cells. titers were determined by flow cytometry 2 d later. TM-H20 and SU-C (EnvC-H20Part4) were able to infect human cells almost as efficiently as the virus with TM-H20 and SU-C (EnvC-H20Part4). TM mutation found in EnvH20 causes Env activation and enables mammalian cell infection even when combined with SU-B. the retroviral Env is responsible for virus entry into the cell, enabling as the first step, its interaction with a specific cell surface receptor (13). the same pattern of amino acid substitutions remained during the second cycle of rodent cell infection; therefore, we assumed that the amino acid changes identified played a role in the virus ability to infect receptor-deficient cells. the sensitivity of HEK293 cells followed the pattern observed in NIL. HEK293 cells were found to be sensitive even to the original RCAS-EnvC-GFP (env gene from PR-RSV-C) the virus with EnvH20 as well as the virus with the two aforementioned mutations retained the highest infection efficiency. Env interacts with a cell receptor at neutral pH, resulting in conformational changes, heptad repeat exposure, and fusion peptide insertion in the cell membrane. the second step is dependent on acidic pH (23, 38, 39), which initiates further conformational alterations, and permits fusion between the virus and the cell membrane (39). the study of the thermostability of PR-RSV-C and Schmidt-Ruppin RSV strain (SR-RSV-D) (22) showed that the virus harboring PR-RSV-C Env (EnvC) was thermostable, but the infectivity of the virus with SR-RSV-D Env decreased with time of exposure to 44 \u00b0C. we tested whether EnvH20 had similar characteristics to a receptor-primed Env. v-activating mutations decrease this activation barrier, so the Env can be activated spontaneously. other mammalian-tropic ASLV mutations have been found in hr1 in SU and HR1 in TM. mutations residing in H20-TM can facilitate human cell entry mediated by SU-B. mutations D32G and L378S in different regions of Env contribute to its activation. these mutations change the Env conformation in such a way that the Env activation barrier is decreased and Env can be spontaneously activated. fusion peptide is inserted into liposome membrane after low pH treatment. mutations are located in the SU part of Env. authors hypothesize that they could be associated with a new host receptor binding. similar mutations identified in the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) resulted in an expanded host range, which included hamsters. a broad range of extended host range mutants suggest such mutants may represent a first step in cross-species transmission evolution. we did not consider substitutions in H20-RSV that lead to synonymous mutations and amino acid substitutions occurring in other ASLV subgroups. we did not consider substitutions in H20-RSV that lead to synonymous mutations and amino acid substitutions occurring in other ASLV subgroups. XC and H20 are rodent tumor cells transformed with the PR-RSV-C strain. the rat XC cell line harbors several provirus copies per genome (20), whereas the hamster H20 cell line possesses only a single provirus (61) both cell lines produce either no or negligible infectious virus (3, 56). 105 GFP-transducing units of each virus in 100 L of cultivation media were incubated with 250 L of liposomes (5 mM) at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min. 350 L of ice-cold 80% sucrose-PBS was added to the preparation to bring it to 40% sucrose. ster H20 cell line possesses only a single provirus (61) both cell lines produce either no or negligible infectious virus (3, 56) the XC cell line is derived from a tumor that was induced by inoculation of PR-RSV-C\u2013infected chicken tissues into newly born rats (62) the difference that chicken sarcoma tissue induced by XC-RSV was inoculated into newly born hamsters (56). a total of 350 L of ice-cold 80% sucrose-PBS was added to the preparation to bring it to 40% sucrose. 700 L of this solution was layered on 3.2 mL of 50% sucrose-PBS and 100 L of 5% sucrose-PBS. the samples were ultracentrifuged at 152,000 g at 4 \u00b0C for 2 h. line NIL-2 is a spontaneously transformed cell line derived from hamster embryo.
