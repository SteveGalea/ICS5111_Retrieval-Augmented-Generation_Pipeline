{"summary": "canine distemper virus is a single-stranded negative RNA virus. it is a single-stranded negative RNA virus belonging to the genus. other members of the genus include measles virus (MV) and rinderpest virus (RPV) primer pairs P1/P4, P2/P4, P3/P4 and P5/P6 were expected to generate a product of 600, 247, 177 bp and 177 bp respectively. nested PCR was performed in a total volume of 25 L containing the first-round PCR products diluted tenfold. RT-nPCR was performed to identify cells infected with CDV vaccine strain, wild-type strain, mixed CDV vaccine and wild-type strains. extracted RNA from serially diluted CDV cell cultures were assayed by RT-nPCR to determine its sensitivity. 30 samples in Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces were assayed by RT-nPCR. 7 dog F 6 vacc S V+/W- 8 dog F 5 vacc C V+/W+ 11 dog M 8 vacc C V+/W+ 12 dog M 8 vacc C V+/W- 12 dog M 8 vacc C V+/W- 12 dog M 6 vacc C V-/W- 13 dog F 6 vacc C V+/W- 14 dog F 26 NI N V+/W- 15 dog F 5 vacc C V+ raccoon F 4 vacc C V-/W- 42 fox F 3 vacc C V-/W- 43 fox M 3 vacc C V-/W+ 44 fox M 5 vacc C V+/W+ 45 fox M 6 vacc C V-/W+ 47 mink F 3 vacc S V-/W- 48 mink F 4 vacc C V+/W- 49 mink F 5 vacc C V+/W+ RT-nPCR was performed to identify cells infected with CDV vaccine strain, wild-type strain, mixed CDV vaccine and wild-type strains, CPV, CAV, CCV, RV, NDV, and uninfected cells. 30 samples in Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces were assayed by RT-nPCR. sex, vaccination record, clinical form of distemper and diagnosis for dogs with naturally occurring distempera No origin sex age Vaccination record Clinical Form of distemper and diagnosis for dogs with naturally occurring distempera No origin sex age. raccoon F 3 vacc C V-/W+ 33 raccoon F 3 vacc C V-/W+ 35 raccoon F 5 vacc C V-/W+ 36 raccoon M 5 vacc S V-/W+ 37 raccoon M 5 vacc C V-/W+ 38 raccoon F 4 vacc C V+/W+ 41 raccoon F 4 vacc C V-/W- 42 ified products were cloned and sequenced, and sequences were aligned with the H genes of a number of CDV strains available in GenBank. thirty field samples from dogs, foxes, and raccoons were assayed by RT-nPCR. the lowest limit of detection with this method was shown to be 0.1 TCID50. 20 field samples tested positive for CDV, among which 15 showed presence of wild-type viruses, and 5 showed presence of vaccine strain. primers P2, P3, P4, P5 and P6 were used to amplify the vaccine and wild-type strains at different anneal temperatures. only one specific band was observed at an anneal temperature from 49-54\u00b0C. the lowest limit of detection with this method was shown to be 0.1 TCID50. the lowest limit of detection with this method was shown to be 0.1 TCID50. 92-6 (Z54166), A75-17 (AF164967), Dog Denmark (Z47761), Dog 91A (AF478544), Dog Turkey (AY093674), 5804-Han90 (X85000), 007LMT(AB212729), Dog5B (AY297453), Dog26D (AB040766), Dog98-002 (AB025270), Greenland (Z47760), Liu (Z47760), Convac ( the method was sensitive, in that it could detect as little as 0.1 TCID50 of the virus. the selected two samples were classified into a branch which belongs to the wild-type strain. 20 of the field samples were CDV-positive, among which 15 were wild-type strain, and 5 were vaccine strain. multiplex RT-nPCR developed in this study is a highly specific and sensitive assay for the rapid detection and differentiation of wild-type and vaccine strains of CDV. authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
