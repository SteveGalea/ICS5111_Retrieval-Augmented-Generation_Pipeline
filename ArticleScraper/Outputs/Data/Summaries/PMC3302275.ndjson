{"summary": "clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway (CMP) is the best-characterized pathway. clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway (CMP) is considered the primary route of endocytosis entry into cells. caveolae are 50- to 100-nm flask-shaped plasma membrane invaginations present in most cell types. formation of caveolae is mediated by the marker protein caveolin-1. signal cascade caused by activation of tyrosine kinases could result in slow but efficient internalization. Iridoviruses are large icosahedral cytoplasmic DNA viruses that contain circularly permutated, terminally redundant, double-stranded DNA genomes. ISKNV was first isolated from mandarin fish (Siniperca chuatsi) in 1998. research on the uptake of tiger frog virus (a ranavirus) into mammalian cells showed that it is a pH-dependent atypical caveola-dependent endocytosis (21) this difference in endocytosis pathways taken by viruses from the same genus may be caused by their infection of different hosts. mouse polyclonal serum antibodies against mandarin fish caveolin-1 (anti-mCav-1) antibody and rabbit polyclonal serum antibodies against the ISKNV structural protein ORF101L (anti-ORF101L) were prepared as previously reported (14, 22) noninternalized viruses were inactivated by using citrate buffer. cells were seeded onto coverslips in 48-well plates 1 day prior to binding. cells were then infected with ISKNV for 4 h at 27\u00b0C. CPZ, NH4Cl, CQ, and sucrose were used to inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis. filipin III, nystatin, genistein, MCD, and PMA were used to inhibit caveola-mediated endocytosis. nocodazole was used to disrupt the microtubule structure. color reaction was developed by using an alkaline phosphatase chromogen (nitroblue tetrazolium [NBT]\u20135-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate [BCIP]) substrate solution. endogenous -tubulin (as an internal control protein) was detected by using an anti-tubulin antibody. anti-mouse IgG or Alexa Fluor 555-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG as secondary antibody in blocking buffer for 1 h. cells were stained with Hoechst 33342, followed by three washes with TBS. an ISKNV strain adapted to grow in MFF-1 cells was used in all experiments. mouse polyclonal serum antibodies against mandarin fish caveolin-1 (anti-mCav-1) antibody and rabbit polyclonal serum antibodies against the ISKNV structural protein ORF101L were prepared as previously reported (14, 22) oquine (CQ) and chlorpromazine (CPZ) were diluted in distilled water. cells were seeded onto coverslips in 48-well plates. incubated at 27\u00b0C for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 16, and 24 h. the cells were then infected with ISKNV for 4 h at 27\u00b0C. after 4 h, the cells were washed once with citrate buffer to inactivate the virus and three times with PBS and then incubated with DMEM plus 10% FBS for 72 h. the membranes were incubated with anti-ORF101L antibodies for 1 h. after washing with TBST, the membrane was incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG. the color reaction was developed by using an alkaline phosphatase chromogen. coverslips were stained with Hoechst 33342, followed by three washes with TBS. cells were viewed, and micrographs were captured with a Zeiss microscope. RESULTS ISKNV infection with MFF-1 cells is a slow process. clathrin-coated vesicles mediates the fast and efficient transfer of receptor-bound particles to an acidic endosomal compartment. internalization processes of virus endocytosis via caveolae were reported previously to be slower than other endocytosis mechanism (2). noninternalized viruses were inactivated by using citrate buffer. at 72 h postinfection, positive cells were detected by IFA. the values of viral infectivity are normalized to the 4-h value. the cells were prechilled and then infected with ISKNV (MOI = 10) for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. under these conditions, the virus bound to the cell surface, but internalization did not occur. the cells were incubated at 27\u00b0C to allow the internalization of virus to begin. CPZ causes clathrin lattices to assemble on endosomal membranes. in the cells treated with CPZ, virus infection was minimally inhibited at 72 h postinfection, even at the highest dose (35 M), as seen via IFA and Western blotting. cholesterol is a prominent compound of lipid rafts, which are involved in caveola formation. the depletion of this compound from the membranes with MCD impairs caveola-mediated endocytosis. treatment of the cells with 1, 1.5, and 1.8 mM MCD inhibited ISKNV infection by 45%, 60%, and 70%, respectively. cells were pretreated with MCD as described above. this step was followed by the addition of various concentrations of exogenous cholesterol as indicated. ISKNV was then added and incubated for 4 h after 72 h of incubation. ISKNV infection was significantly inhibited in cells treated with 1.8 mM MCD alone. the rate of infection was only 30%. the cholesterol replenishment resulted in a dose-dependent reversal of the inhibitory effect of MCD. the expression levels of ORF101L in ISKNV-infected cells were significantly inhibited by 100 g/ml nystatin or 50 g/ml filipin III with 20 g/ml progesterone. these results confirm the role of cholesterol in the internalization of ISKNV into MFF-1 cells. endocytosis via caveolae is clathrin independent, sensitive to cholesterol depletion, associated with signaling events, and cells were processed for IFA or WB with anti-ORF101L antibody. the viral infection rate of cells not treated with reagents was arbitrarily set as 100%. previous research on SV40 showed that signal induction is important for viral entry. ISKNV-induced transmembrane signaling plays an important role in the internalization of ISKNV into MFF-1 cells. atypical caveola-mediated endocytosis through the trans-Golgi network was found for the entry of BK virus into permissive Vero cells. classical caveola-dependent endocytosis pathway is pH independent (16, 21) CQ and NH4Cl are weakly basic amines that selectively enter cellular compartments with a low internal pH. infections were scored by measuring the expression of the structural protein ORF101L using immunofluorescence staining. NH4Cl and CQ treatments did not significantly inhibit ISKNV infection. the viral infections were quantified as the percentage of positive, treated cells relative to the number of untreated control cells. for the IFA, the viral infections were quantified as the percentage of positive, treated cells relative to the number of untreated cells. dynamin inhibits dynamin-dependent endocytosis vesicles. dynasore blocks ISKNV infection of MFF-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. dynasore blocks ISKNV entry into MFF-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. the viral infection rate of cells not treated with reagents was arbitrarily set as 100%. the data shown are the means and standard deviations of the results from three independent experiments. the treatment of cells with 10 M nocodazole dramatically decreased (about an 80% reduction) ISKNV infection compared to the untreated controls. the results suggest that ISKNV entry into MFF-1 cells is dependent on microtubules. confocal microscopy of ISKNV internalization into MFF-1 cells. cells grown on coverslips were prechilled and then infected with ISKNV at 4\u00b0C for 1 h. noninternalized viruses were washed up by using TBS. only about 6% of MFF-1 cells were infected after 1 h of exposure to ISKNV. time of infection reached half-maximal infection level (t1/2) about 7 h after the addition of virus. cells were processed for IFA or Western blotting with anti-ORF101L antibody. the viral infection rate of cells not treated with reagents (as a positive control) was arbitrarily set as 100%. ISKNV entered MFF-1 cells between 2 and 4 h after the initiation of infection. iridovirus endocytosis was previously described to be clathrin dependent (8). inhibitors that specifically block different entry pathways were used to investigate the early steps of ISKNV infection. clathrin-mediated endocytosis is clathrin-mediated. entry of ISKNV is dependent on membrane cholesterol. treatment of cells with 1, 1.5, and 1.8 mM MCD inhibited ISKNV infection. 0.5 mM MCD did not significantly change the level of the ORF101L protein. however, ORF101L expression was significantly inhibited by 1.8 mM MCD. these results suggest that depletion of cellular cholesterol resulted in a significant reduction of subsequent ISKNV infection. g/ml progesterone or were left untreated (as a positive control), and ISKNV infection was significantly inhibited in cells treated with 1.8 mM MCD for 1 h. after 72 h of incubation, the samples were processed for IFA or WB with anti-ORF101L antibody. the cholesterol replenishment resulted in a dose-dependent reversal of the inhibitory effect of MCD on ISKNV infection. the acute effect of cholesterol depletion by MCD may also result in the inhibition of cholesterol-independent endocytosis (25). endocytosis via caveolae is clathrin independent, sensitive to cholesterol depletion, associated with signaling events, and dynamin dependent. effect of treatment of MFF-1 cells with different doses of PMA (0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, and 10 M) was dose-dependent reduction of ISKNV infection. genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, blocks the signals induced by JCV and SV40 (45), so we determined whether or not this chemical was also capable of blocking the entry of ISKNV. no significant inhibitions of the internalization of AF488-LDL into MFF-1 cells were seen in our experiments. the effect of wortmannin on infection by ISKNV is worth studying. wortmannin inhibited the expression of ORF101L. wortmannin also inhibited the expression of ORF101L. ISKNV-infected cells were equally susceptible to ISKNV entry. cells left untreated or treated with NH4Cl or CQ were also not significantly inhibited. dynamin is a large GTPase that forms a dynamin ring at the stem connecting the nascent vesicle to the plasma membrane. it is involved in the initial steps of both clathrin-mediated endocytosis and caveola-mediated endocytosis. dynamin inhibits the activity of dynamin-1 and dynamin-2 (32). the infectious entry of ISKNV was 55% to 65% inhibited by 25 to 50 M dynasore in the IFA. ORF101L expression was significantly inhibited by 50 M dynasore in the Western blot analysis. these results demonstrate that dynasore blocks ISKNV infection of MFF-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. cells grown on coverslips were prechilled and then infected with ISKNV at 4\u00b0C for 1 h. noninternalized viruses were then washed by using TBS. cells were analyzed by IFA using anti-ORF101L antibodies. confocal microscopy of ISKNV internalization into MFF-1 cells. cells grown on coverslips were prechilled and then infected with ISKNV at 4\u00b0C for 1 h. cells were analyzed by IFA using anti-mCav-1 and anti-ORF101L antibodies. they were then viewed under a confocal microscope (LSM510; Zeiss) using 555/488-nm argon-krypton and 543-nm helium-neon lasers. DISCUSSION Viruses that enter cells by endocytosis generally penetrate via different pathways. ISKNV infection of MFF-1 cells reached the half-maximal infection level (t1/2) about 7 h after the addition of virus, whereas VSV reaches the t1/2 after just 1.5 h (47) slow infection kinetics were also observed for the entry of amphotropic murine leukemia virus into NIH 3T3 cells by caveola-dependent endocytosis. caveolin-1, albumin binding to its receptor, gp60, triggers caveola endocytosis via a Gi-coupled Src kinase-mediated pathway (35). caveolin-1 plays an important role in caveola formation; recombinant expression of caveolin-1 in cells devoid of caveolae led to formation of caveola-like vesicles (49) a structural collar around the neck of caveolae hydrolyzes GTP to mediate internalization via the fission of caveolae from the plasma membrane to form free transport vesicles. dynasore rapidly inhibits the GTPase activity of dynamin-1 and dynamin-2 with high specificity. we then determined a model of caveola-dependent endocytosis used by ISKNV to enter MFF-1 cells. caveolin-1 binds to cholesterol at a 1:1 ratio and cross links to glycosphingolipid. it works as an integral, nonspanning membrane protein cotranslationally inserted from the cytosol into the membrane of the ER and forms oligomers. the scaffold molecules could also be recruited (42) the process is different from the clathrin-mediated endocytosis of FV3 into BHK-21 cells and the pH-dependent atypical caveola-mediated endocytosis of TFV into HepG2 cells (5, 21) these differences in hosts may result in this variety of endocytosis pathways taken by viruses from the same genus. caveolae."}
