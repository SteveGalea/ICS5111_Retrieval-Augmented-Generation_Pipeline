{"summary": "Ubiquitin is a small protein that is added post-translationally to substrate proteins. it has a major role in DNA repair, transcriptional regulation, cell cycle and stress responses. the linkage types afford distinct topologies, essential in determining the substrate protein's fate. ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs), ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases (UCHs), ovarian tumor proteases (MJDs), the JAB1/MPN/MOV34 family (JAMMs) and the motif interacting with Ub-containing novel DUB (MINDY) family. probes targeting DUBs based on monoubiquitin have been successful in characterizing new DUB family members. the first example of an activity-based probe targeting DUBs consisted of a vinyl sulfone \u201cwarhead\u201d in place of the C-terminal glycine residue of ubiquitin. a variety of thiol-reactive electrophiles have since been reported. the generation of selective probes harbors significant challenges. the review will focus on the design and synthesis of probes. iterative approach screening >120 total variants afforded a probe with high USP7 selectivity. probes with peptide sequences reflecting the K48 and K63 regions were tested in Jurkat cell lysate. ubiquitinated peptide bearing a SeCys at Ub75-thioester. TRIM25 is known to be deubiquitiniated by USP15. reactivity was demonstrated with recombinant USP15. in 2014 the Zhuang laboratory developed an alternative method using a warhead bearing a sulfur reactive group. the proximal HA-ubiquitin containing a single cysteine at the 48/63 position was reacted to generate two diubiquitin activity-based probes. this elegant method affords a non-hydrolyzable linker of the correct length, although it is incompatible with multiple cysteine residues. alkyne functionalized TDAE 13 is coupled to azido functionalized Ub monomer 14 using copper catalyzed cycloaddition. a subsequent reaction with an E2 enzyme eliminates the tosyl component of the TDAE 12. diaminnocutyric acid replaced the lysine residue of interest. a short sulfur containing linker was coupled prior to ligation and desulfurization to afford the diubiquitin probes. all probes were tested with recombinant DUBs, the K11 and K48 probes also tested in EL4 lysate. lycine proved to be selective for OTULIN in cell lysate. they used photoaffinity labeling for their K27 linked diubiquitin probe. this was ligated to Ub75-NH2NH2 to afford the native isopeptide bond adjacent to a single cysteine. tong and co-workers extended the concept a step further by generating triubiquitin activity-based probes. the probes bear a native isopeptide bond between the proximal and middle ubiquitin and a warhead between the middle and distal ubiquitin. mes to further unpick the challenging aim of generating Ubiquitin-protein conjugate probes. ubiquitinated -globin forming DHA at the single cysteine (104) present in -globin. deprotection allowed ligation to Biotin-Ub75-thioester. the Zhuang laboratory used their warhead containing linker strategy to generate ubiquitin-PCNA probes representing K107 and K164 ubiquitinated PCNA. this strategy is elegant in its simplicity although it required mutation of the four cysteines in PCNA to ensure site selectivity. probes with peptide sequences reflecting the K48 and K63 regions were tested in Jurkat cell lysate. low reactivity was seen for mutants reported to be strong binders in previous phage display assays. a peptide centered on K117 of TRIM25 was used, containing two Cys residues and a Met alongside the SeCys introduced at position 117. selective alkylation of Selenium at low pH afforded the ubiquitinated peptide in the presence of Cys residues. the method is broadly applicable, although incompatible with multiple methionine residues. the linker is four atoms longer than in the natural substrate but is uncleavable, providing a robust probe. the method was coupled to a warhead bearing a sulfur reactive group. alkyne functionalized TDAE 13 is coupled to azido functionalized Ub monomer 14 using copper catalyzed cycloaddition. a subsequent reaction with an E2 enzyme eliminates the tosyl component of the TDAE 12, affording the final probe 11 containing a Michael acceptor. the linear probes labeled recombinant DUBs and the linear probe showed only cleavage with the DUBs tested. the linear probe showed both labeling and cleavage with the linear probes. this resulted in a linear probe with the native linker length and an electrophilic trap one bond away from the scissile peptide bond. they used photoaffinity labeling for their K27 linked diubiquitin probe. this was ligated to the -N to afford the native isopeptide bond adjacent to a single cysteine. to this end they generated triazole linked non-cleavable diubiquitins bearing a C-terminal thioester on the proximal ubiquitin. a propargyl warhead was introduced to generate the probe. this allowed examination of DUB activity for diubiquitin binding in the S1-S2 pocket without degradation of the probe. Brik and co-workers targeted ubiquitinated -globin, forming DHA at the single cysteine present in -globin and coupling to a thiol bearing thiazolidine. a further DHA formation step installed the electrophilic trap into the Ubiquitin--globin conjugate. ubiquitin-PCNA probes represent K107 and K164 ubiquitinated PCNA. this strategy is elegant in its simplicity although it required mutation of the four cysteines in PCNA to ensure site selectivity. native chemical ligation of Ub71-thioester introduced the modified C-terminus of the protein. the modified C-terminus contained an electrophilic trap at the 74 position and a 5\u2032-sulfonyladenosine-based modification. the probe labeled recombinant E1s and aided crystallization. endogenous UBA1 was selectively labeled in HEK293 lysate. a single cysteine mutant of His-UBE2L3 was reacted with the monomers. the probes were stable and inert to recombinant DUBs. the probes were tested against catalytic domains of NEDD4 and UBE3C. probing HeLa cells saw enrichment of several E3 enzymes. the linker is three atoms longer than the native. the single cysteine in E2 UBE2N was reacted with TDAEs to form E2-based probes for E1 activity. the probes react specifically with their cognate E1 enzymes over Ubl conjugation machinery. however, some reactivity was observed with the DUB IsoT. the triazole linker and electrophile replace residues 74-76 of ubiquitin. the active site of Parkin was labeled by both probes. Virdee et al. demonstrated an application in profiling primary fibroblasts from Parkinson's disease patients. several ubiquitin-protein conjugate probes now exist. new methodology has been applied to explore ubiquitin conjugation machinery. probes varying in linker length, positioning of electrophilic trap and stability to DUBs. application of this methodology to conjugate probes could enable the development of cell-permeable versions. large scale biological screens combined with the latest chemoproteomic methods, similar to those carried out using monoubiquitin probes, could provide a more resolved picture of DUB activity in cells."}
