{"summary": "the pool of autoreactive T cells available for activation is limited to a large extent by mechanisms of tolerance induction that eliminate self-reactive T cells 1. these T cells do not cause autoimmune disease when encountering self-antigen in vivo unless the self-antigen is presented in an immunostimulatory context 2. comparable numbers of T cells were isolated from the CNS of both MBP-specific TCR transgenic mice and wild-type mice. however, most of the MBP-specific T cells found in the CNS of young mice exhibited a naive phenotype rather than an activated or memory phenotype. B10.PL (73 NS)/Sn, C57Bl/6J, and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) TCR transgenic mice (B6, D2-TgN (TCR LCMV) 327Sdz 15) were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory. -CD45RB (clone 16A); biotin-conjugated anti-TCR (clone H57.597), anti-CD49d (clone R1-2), anti-IgG (clone MR 5-2), anti-CD45R (clone RA3-6B2), anti-CD8 (clone 53-6.7), anti-V2 (clone B20.1), anti-CD4 (clone RM 4-5), anti mice were perfused with 50 ml of heparinized PBS via the left ventricle of the heart. spinal cords were removed via insufflation and the brain was dissected. cells were resuspended in 37% Percoll, centrifuged for 15 min. proflavin is a nuclear dye that crosses the endothelium of most blood vessels easily but does not cross the blood\u2013brain barrier 18 19. in two separate staining experiments, >80% of the CNS mononuclear cells did not stain positively for proflavin. in some experiments, cervical and inguinal LNs were harvested separately. s. TEa T cells were stimulated in the presence or absence of 1 M Ova 323\u2013339 peptide and T cell\u2013depleted APCs. 5-Bromo-2\u2032-deoxyuridine (BrdU; 25 g/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) was added after 48 h of culture and cells were harvested 12\u201316 h later. PL (73 NS)/Sn, C57Bl/6J, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) TCR transgenic mice (B6, D2-TgN [TCR Ova] 1100Mjb 16) and E52-68:I-Ab (TEa) TCR transgenic mice 17 were provided by Dr. Michael Bevan (University of Washington, Seattle, WA) biotin-conjugated anti-TCR (clone H57.597), anti-CD49d (clone R1-2), anti-IgG (clone MR 5-2), anti-CD45R (clone RA3-6B2), anti-CD8 (clone 53-6.7), anti-V2 (clone B20.1), anti-CD4 (clone RM 4-5), anti-CD45RB (clone 16A), and mice were perfused with 50 ml of heparinized PBS via the left ventricle of the heart. spinal cords were removed via insufflation and the brain was dissected. cells were resuspended in 37% Percoll, centrifuged for 15 min. proflavin is a nuclear dye that crosses the endothelium of most blood vessels easily but does not cross the blood\u2013brain barrier 18 19. in two separate staining experiments, >80% of the CNS mononuclear cells did not stain positively for proflavin. in some experiments, cervical and inguinal LNs were harvested separately. cells were stimulated in the presence or absence of 1 M Ova 323\u2013339 peptide. 5-Bromo-2\u2032-deoxyuridine (BrdU; 25 g/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) was added after 48 h of culture. proliferation was assessed by staining the cultured cells with PE-labeled anti-V2 or anti-TCR monoclonal antibody. lymphocytes were isolated from the brain and spinal cord of clinically healthy, 4\u20137-wk-old, well perfused, MBP TCR1 transgenic mice on the Rag+/+ background. the number of T cells per gram of CNS tissue isolated from healthy mice was comparable to the number isolated from nontransgenic mice. T cells in the CNS of young TCR transgenic mice are predominantly naive. previous studies in nontransgenic mice indicated that only activated T cells cross the blood\u2013brain barrier 7 9 10. T cells in the CNS of young TCR transgenic mice are predominantly naive. the phenotype of CD44high splenocytes in both the periphery and CNS of Rag/ MBP TCR transgenic mice was strikingly different from the phenotype seen in nontransgenic mice. the percentage of CD44high splenocytes in both Rag/ MBP TCR1 and Rag/ MBP TCR2 transgenic mice was 10-fold lower than the percentage in nontransgenic mice. the number of T cells isolated per gram of CNS tissue was again comparable to the number of T cells isolated from nontransgenic control mice. in each Rag/ TCR transgenic model except Rag/ MBP TCR1 transgenic mice, the percentage of naive T cells found in the CNS is >80% compared with 30% in nontransgenic mice. CNS lymphocytes were enriched for CD62Llow cells compared with splenocytes in nontransgenic animals (CNS, 47 7%; spleen, 10 7%; n = 3), Rag/ MBP TCR2 transgenic mice (CNS, 46 11%; spleen, 7 2%; n = 3), and Rag/ Ova transgenic mice (CNS, 64 10%; spleen, 10 1%; n = 4), and Rag transgenic mice were analyzed because older Rag/ MBP TCR transgenic mice exhibit a 100% incidence of spontaneous EAE 12. in contrast, Rag+/+ MBP TCR1 transgenic mice exhibit EAE primarily between 5 to 10 wk of age, but very few cases of EAE are observed in mice >69 d of age 14. 49d high Percentage ofCD44 high Percentage ofCD45RB low CNS Spleen CNS Spleen CNS Spleen CNS Spleen B10.PL 17.7 7.9 51.7 4.9 37.7 12.2 57.9 11.1 26.8 7.4 63.9 5.8 32.9 2.8 NTG n = 9 n = 1 n = 1 n = 1 n = 1 n = 1 n = 1 n = 1 n = 1 n per gram of tissue in older MBP TCR transgenic mice is significantly greater than the number found in older nontransgenic mice. expression of the MBP TCR results in more antigenic stimulation than the diverse repertoire of TCRs expressed in nontransgenic mice. this suggests that expression of the MBP TCR results in more antigenic stimulation than the diverse repertoire of TCRs expressed in nontransgenic mice. naive MBP-specific transgenic T cells entering the CNS undergo tolerance in situ and become unresponsive to MBP. CNS T cells from 14\u201317 healthy MBP TCR1 transgenic mice were pooled and cultured in vitro with MBP Ac1-11. T cells from wild-type mice were added as APCs. Flow cytometric analysis measuring proliferation of pooled CNS T cells purified from spinal cords of 17 MBP TCR1 transgenic mice and LN T cells from the same animals. proliferating T cells are identified as BrdU+ cells as indicated by the bar. Fig. 4 C compares the proliferative responses to MBP Ac1-11 of V2+ T cells isolated from the cervical and inguinal LNs of MBP TCR1 transgenic mice. T cells from both types of LNs proliferated strongly to MBP peptide, supporting the idea that induction of tolerance in the CNS occurs within the CNS itself. the incidence of spontaneous EAE in the colony from which these mice were obtained is 15%. mononuclear cells in the CNS of mice with subclinical EAE will already be activated and would be expected to proliferate in vitro. MBP TCR transgenic T cells isolated from peripheral LN cells were incubated with MBP Ac1-11 and irradiated APCs. CNS mononuclear cells were isolated from 15\u201317 MBP TCR transgenic or nontransgenic mice. mice used for these experiments were 4\u201312 wk of age. a second MBP TCR transgenic model (MBP TCR2) showed normal numbers of T cells within the CNS compared with age-matched nontransgenic mice. the number of T cells isolated from the CNS of Rag/ MBP TCR transgenic mice was comparable to the number isolated from nontransgenic mice. peripheral T cells from nontransgenic mice expressed significantly lower levels of activation/memory markers compared with CNS T cells (P = 0.002) these observations are consistent with earlier studies showing that the CNS is preferentially trafficked by activated T cells. T cells in the CNS of TCR transgenic mice have a predominately naive phenotype. in both Rag/ MBP TCR1 and Rag/ MBP TCR2 transgenic mice was 10-fold lower than the percentage in nontransgenic mice. the majority of T cells isolated from the CNS of Rag/ MBP TCR1 and MBP TCR2 transgenic mice also exhibited a naive phenotype. the data described above suggest that reducing the number of activated T cells in the periphery does not diminish trafficking to the CNS. incidence of spontaneous EAE is 45% in MBP TCR1 mice. incidence of spontaneous EAE is only 11% in MBP TCR2 transgenic mice 25. in nontransgenic and TCR transgenic mice, CD62L expression was observed on naive T cells. NS and lack of correlation with expression of activation markers suggest that CD62L is not strictly a naive T cell marker. the observation that young Rag/ MBP TCR1 transgenic mice have a similar percentage of CD45RBlow T cells in the CNS and spleen as nontransgenic mice. the age-dependent decrease in naive T cells was significantly greater in MBP TCR1 transgenic mice than in nontransgenic mice (P = 0.0003). a similar age-dependent decrease in naive T cells is seen in MBP TCR2 transgenic mice. n = 9 n = 10 n = 10 MBP 12.1 0.7 38.8 0.1 ND ND 39.5 7 17.2 11 78.8 8.6 49.9 2.4 TCR2 n = 2 n = 2 n = 5 n = 2 n = 2 C57Bl/6 18.7 41.2 ND ND 62.7 36.4 65.3 34.4 Ntg n = 1 n = 1 n = 1 n = 1 n = 1 n the increase in memory T cells does not reflect an increase in T cells with endogenously rearranged TCR chains. these data are in contrast to results from MHC class II\u2013restricted TCR transgenic mice specific for a nonself antigen, pigeon cytochrome C 24. however, this increase was completely in the transgene-negative T cells rather than the transgene-positive T cells. both CNS and LN T cells harvested from TEa TCR transgenic mice specific for the MHC class II E peptide and DO11.10 TCR transgenic mice specific for ovalbumin proliferated equally when stimulated with E peptide and Ova peptide. nonresponsiveness of T cells from the CNS was observed only when the T cells were specific for a CNS antigen. the percentage of proliferating (BrdU+) V2+ T cells was determined for T cells harvested from the CLN and ILN (n = 2). mice used for all of these experiments were 4\u201312 wk of age. in all experiments described so far, no more than 21 MBP TCR transgenic mice were pooled per experiment. in one additional experiment, 36 MBP TCR1 TCR transgenic mice were pooled in order to expand the number of wells exposed to IL-2. the incidence of spontaneous EAE in the colony from which these mice were obtained is 15%. the transgenic LN T cells proliferated strongly to MBP Ac1-11 in both the presence and absence of CNS mononuclear cells isolated from nontransgenic mice. these results confirm our observations made with the TEa and DO11.10 TCR transgenic mice that CNS mononuclear cells do not generally suppress T cell proliferation. previous work indicated that immunological privilege was the result of the specialized structure of the blood\u2013brain barrier that limited T cell trafficking to activated T cells 7 9 10. however, recent experiments in sheep demonstrated that naive lymphocytes infused directly into the blood could circulate through the cerebral spinal fluid. dendritic cells and moth\u2013cytochrome C peptide were injected into the CNS of MHC class II\u2013restricted moth\u2013cytochrome C peptide TCR transgenic mice. naive T cells are unresponsive to antigen while MBP-specific T cells from the same animals are fully functional in response to antigen stimulation. tolerance in naive MBP-specific T cells entering the CNS is tissue-specific rather than systemic. tolerance does not occur through downregulation of TCR or CD4 because the expression of these receptors on CNS T cells is comparable to that observed on peripheral T cells. naive CD4+ T cells specific for non-CNS antigens proliferate equally well when they are isolated from either the CNS or LNs. the nonresponsiveness induced in MBP-specific T cells in situ was not reversed by addition of exogenous IL-2 in vitro. in vivo induction of anergy is not necessarily overcome by addition of exogenous IL-2 42 43 44 45 46. the number of MBP-specific T cells in the CNS of these mice decreases. this increase is due in part to expression of the MBP-specific TCR. the number of memory T cells in older TCR transgenic mice is greater in the CNS of older TCR transgenic mice. BP-specific T cells are no longer susceptible to tolerance in situ and can initiate autoimmune disease. a new form of immunoregulation of CNS-specific T cells must be considered in the study of the pathogenesis of CNS autoimmunity."}
