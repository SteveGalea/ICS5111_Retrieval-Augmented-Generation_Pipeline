{"summary": "zoonoses have led to some of the most devastating and medically relevant outbreaks in modern history. recent viral zoonoses have led to some of the most devastating and medically relevant outbreaks in modern history. factors influencing transmission of zoonotic pathogens to humans include increasing population density, greater contact with wildlife, increased travel, and poor public health infrastructure. stranded RNA (dsRNA), a common byproduct of both RNA and DNA virus replication, followed by dimerization and autophosphorylation. Activated PKR then phosphorylates the -subunit of eIF2. this ultimately arresting translation initiation. a universal mechanism of rapid adaptation occurring in eukaryotes [14], [15], prokaryotes [16], and viruses [18], enabling diverse adaptations. our results suggest that gene amplification in an intermediate host may be a risk factor for broad cross-species transmission independent of other adaptive events. a recombinant vaccinia virus lacking the PKR inhibitor E3L (VVE3L+RhTRS1) produced 100 to 1000-fold less virus 1190 stably transduced with lentiviral vectors expressing control or PKR-specific shRNAs. results are represented as means +1 STD. this replication defect in PRO1190 cells may be due to incomplete inhibition of PKR in these cells by RhTRS1. a previously reported AGM PKR that is sensitive to RhTRS1 is heterozygous in PRO1190 cells. one of these single nucleotide variants changes a residue (T577M) that is evolving under positive selection in primates. Virus produced 48 hpi was titered on permissive BSC40 cells. the specific progeny viruses were enumerated by detecting -gal (VVE3L+RhTRS1) and eGFP (VVEK+RhTRS1). VV-A replicated 290-fold better than VVE3L+RhTRS1. fibroblasts with VVEK+RhTRS1 replicated poorly and VV-g replicated efficiently in each cell type. all three passaged pools replicated between 1000- to 10,000-fold better than VVEK+RhTRS1 in both HFF and RF. 5.2, 1.9, and 6.3 pfu of progeny emerged from HFF and 40.8, 7.3, and 3.7 emerged from RF. gene amplification as a mechanism of rapid adaptation in vaccinia virus has been well documented [17], [18], [21]. to determine whether gene amplification could account for the broadly improved replication of passaged VVEK+RhTRS1. each of the passaged pools contained between 1.4 and 1.9 copies of rhtrs1 per genome. we detected 3 kb products in all three virus pools, and 2.3 kb and 1.8 kb products only in the VV-A virus pool. the larger product represented a recombination between the vaccinia virus gene L5R upstream of rhtrs1 and J2R downstream of rhtrs1. however, the presence of an identical recombination site in all three passaged virus pools suggests that duplication may have been present at transition mutations affecting the A24R and A37R genes were present at >50% frequencies in VV-A and VV-B respectively. none of the other mutations were detected in all three pools. the presence of these mutations raised the question of whether the expanded species tropism was due to the VV gene mutations. 74 0.0% 125 40.0% 132 0.0% 175 0.0% 148499 CA C A35R indel 57 0.0% 117 41.9% 124 0.0% 149 1.3% 148601 CTA C A35R indel 72 0.0% 93 0.0% 91 0.0% 152 7.9% 148625 TG T A35R indel 77 0.0% 90 1.1% 107 12.2% 165 37.0% 149912 G A A37R mis:S116N htrs1 amplification alone is sufficient to expand the species tropism of VVEK+RhTRS1. the passaged viruses replicated 100- to 1000-fold less efficiently than VV-g. rhtrs1 amplification provided a substantial growth benefit in HFF. rhtrs1 amplification fully inhibits PRO1190 PKR. kd cells replicated 10-fold less well than VV-g in the HFF-PKR kd cells. this remaining replication defect may be due to incomplete PKR knockdown. infected proteins were labeled with 35S-methionine for 1 h. cell lysates were analyzed by autoradiography or immunoblotting. PKR phosphorylation was elevated in all virus infected cells except VV-g. amplification of rhtrs1 is able to inhibit PKR at least partially in PRO1190 cells. amplification of rhtrs1 is a necessary intermediate for VVEK+RhTRS1 replication in HFF Because selection in A. GM cells resulted in a broad expansion of viral species tropism. we investigated whether passage of VVEK+RhTRS1 directly in HFF would similarly select for mutants that improved replication in HFF. we therefore serially infected PRO1190 cells and HFF with VVEK+RhTRS1 in parallel. the improved replication of the viruses that had been passaged in PRO1190 cells was sufficient to enable stable propagation in HFF. replication increased between 5- to 14-fold after only two passages, suggesting further adaptation occurred in HFF cells. a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing RhTRS1 produced 100 to 1000-fold less virus in AGM-derived PRO1190 cells relative to VV-g. PKR inhibits VVEK+RhTRS1 replication in different AGM cells. we generated PRO1190 cells stably expressing either a PKR-specific shRNA (PRO1190-PKR kd), which resulted in a 56% reduction of PKR expression. PKR-specific RT-qPCR demonstrated a 60% reduction in PKR mRNA from PRO1190-PKR kd cells relative to PRO1190-ctrl kd cells (2578 copies or 6503 copies PKR/ng total RNA respectively) s1 amplification expands virus tropism to human and rhesus macaque cells. we infected PRO1190 cells with VVEK+RhTRS1 at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI = 0.1) after four passages we observed a 10- to 100-fold increase in viral replication that remained stable for at least three subsequent passages. serial passage through PRO1190 cells increased the fitness of passaged viruses approximately 100-fold relative to the initial VVEK+RhTRS1. three independent infections resulted in an 10-fold to 100-fold gain of replication fitness in PRO1190 cells. 1.9, 6.3 pfu of progeny emerged from HFF and 40.8, 7.3, and 3.7. this suggests that these viruses were sufficiently well adapted to enable continuous propagation in these cells. adaptation of VVEK+RhTRS1 in minimally permissive fibroblasts also provides a substantial replication benefit in human and rhesus cells expressing distantly related PKR proteins. rhtrs1 copy number increased as a percentage of total reads in viruses predicted to have more copies of rhtrs1. we detected 3 kb products in all three virus pools, and 2.3 kb and 1.8 kb products only in the VV-A virus pool. 2R recombined with the neoR gene, which was introduced as a selection marker during construction of VVEK+RhTRS1. the presence of an identical recombination site in all three passaged virus pools suggests that duplication may have been present at a very low frequency in the initial virus population.

RhTRS1 inhibits the PKR pathway after PKR phosphorylation. it is possible that rhtrs1 amplification altered the mechanism of PKR inhibition. we infected PRO1190 with VV-g, VVE3L, VVEK+RhTRS1 and VV-A at an MOI of 3. PKR phosphorylation was elevated in all virus infected cells except VV-g. a single RhTRS1 gene weakly inhibits the PKR pathway. infection with VV-A resulted in low levels of eIF2 phosphorylation. infection of HFF with VVEK+RhTRS1 resulted in nearly complete shut off of protein synthesis by 24 hpi. a single copy of rhtrs1 was insufficient to inhibit translational shutoff mediated by human PKR. but amplification of this weak antagonist resulted in partial inhibition of human PKR allowing enough protein synthesis to support a modest level of virus replication. PRO1190 or HFF were infected with VVEK+RhTRS1 (MOI = 0.1) virus progeny harvested at 48 hpi was titered on BSC40 cells and used to infect new HFF. no virus survived three rounds of passage through HFF. we did not find any mutations in rhtrs1; however, we found an average rhtrs1 copy number of 1.7, 2.8, and 2.7 for the virus pools derived from VV-A, VV-B and VV-C. two VV gene mutations (in F7L [indel] and J6R) that arose during PRO1190 adaptation were lost after HFF adaptation. rhtrs1 locus amplified during serial passage of VVEK+RhTRS1 in minimally permissive PRO1190 cells. it is not clear whether the initial duplication occurred during preparation of the VVEK+RhTRS1 stock in BSC40 cells or during the first few passages in the PRO1190 cells. vaccinia virus adapts rapidly to selective conditions imposed by relatively resistant host restriction factors. mutations in A24R, A35R, and A37R are the most intriguing, as they were either present at >50% frequency in one pool (A24R and A37R) or detectable in all three pools (A35R) all three passaged virus pools contained nucleotide deletions in A35R at greater than 10% frequency. variola virus contains a truncation in its A35R gene, demonstrating similar truncations have evolved in the past. further studies are underway to evaluate the potential contributions of these mutations to viral replication. a substantial proportion of the block to VV-A replication in HFF is still mediated by PKR despite RhTRS1 overexpression. this suggests that further adaptation in HFF may be necessary to block the PKR pathway in HFF completely. gene amplification may be a common evolutionary strategy employed by large DNA viruses, permitting modest replication in otherwise resistant host species. pEQ1364 was constructed by moving the RhTRS1 gene as a HindIII/PmeI fragment from pEQ1215 [20] into the HindIII/HpaI sites of pLHCX. Vaccinia virus (VV) Copenhagen strain (VC2) [33] and VVE3L [34] were propagated and titered in BSC40 cells. VC-R2 (VVE3LK3L) was constructed by replacing the E3L gene in the K3L-deleted VACV vP872 strain (VC2 in VC2 background, provided by Bertram Jacobs) PCR products were cloned into the pCR2.1 TOPO vector to generate plasmid S96. BS-C-1 cells grown on 12 well plates were infected with vP872 at MOI = 2. green plaques were picked after 48 hours and plated in a dilutions series on RK13+E3L+K3L cells. contigs were assembled and curated in Geneious Pro v4.8.5 (GenBank #KF728076-7) the predicted amino acid sequence was aligned to the predicted amino acid sequences of previously reported AGM (GenBank # EU733254), rhesus macaque (GenBank# EU733261), and human PKR (GenBank # NM001135651) competition assay PRO1190 cells were co-infected with 0.1 MOI of either VVEK+RhTRS1 or VV-A. 0.1 MOI of VVE3L+RhTRS1 was a common competitor. amplification products were gel-purified and cloned using the Strataclone PCR cloning kit (Agilent) following the manufacturer's suggested protocol. 75 ng of viral DNA was sheared and ligated to adaptors by transposition using the Nextera kit (Epicentre) custom scripts were used to determine the allele frequency (fraction reads supporting variant allele out of all aligned reads at a given site) from each evolved viral pool were aligned to the parental reference genome. copy number was estimated by counting the depth of read coverage within sliding windows of 100 bp. the standard curve was generated from 10-fold serial dilutions of a PRO1190 PKR containing plasmid (described above in PRO1190 PKR sequence analysis, pEQ1334) diluted in 200 pg/L salmon sperm DNA. RT-qPCR was performed on a Rotor-Gene Q thermocycler (Qiagen) with temperature holds at 37\u00b0C15 min and 95\u00b0C10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C10 human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF), rhesus fibroblasts (RF), BSC40 and HeLa cells were maintained in modified Eagle's medium. at times, PRO1190 cell lines were also propagated in Minimal Essential Medium with 20% fetal calf serum and anitbiotics to enable more rapid growth. VC-R2 (VVE3LK3L) was constructed by replacing the E3L gene in the VACV vP872 strain (K3L in VC2 background, provided by Bertram Jacobs) [35] by homologous recombination. the 518 bp 5\u2032 arm was created by PCR amplification of VC2 DNA with primers C15 (5\u2032-GATTAAGGGTACTAGCGGCACCG\u20323\u2032)C16 (5\u2032- plates were infected with vP872 at MOI = 2 and transfected 2 hours after infection with 1 g of purified PCR product. green plaques were picked after 48 hours at the highest dilution possible. EGFP expression in VC-R2 is under the control of the endogenous E3L promoter. the predicted amino acid sequence was aligned to the predicted amino acid sequences of previously reported AGM (GenBank # EU733254), rhesus macaque (GenBank# EU733261), and human PKR (GenBank # NM001135651) cells were collected, pelleted and resuspended in 1 mL DMEM+10% NuSerum. two days post-infection cells were collected, pelleted and resuspended in 1 mL DMEM+10% NuSerum. plaques were detected with the -gal substrate ImaGene Red C12RG following the manufacturer's directions. transposition was performed in 20 ul volume using 0.1 l Nextera transposase enzyme. PCR incorporated a sample-specific barcode tag on the reverse primer. amplified libraries were pooled and cleaned using ampure beads. oligonucleotides were designed that bind near the 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 end of RhTRS1. high-fidelity PCR was performed with 100 ng of purified virus DNA. amplification products were gel-purified and cloned using the Nextera kit. the pooled libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 instrument (Illumina) using 101-bp forward and reverse reads with a 9-bp index to read the per-sample barcode. de novo assembly guided by the Vaccinia virus Copenhagen genome (GenBank #M35027.1) was used to construct a reference assembly sequence for VVEK+RhTRS1 (Tables S1 and S2) reads from the parental virus were assembled to con PKR (sc-6282; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), phospho-PKR (T446; 1120-1; Epitomics), eIF2 or phospho-eIF2 (Ser51) antibody (both from Cell Signaling Technology, catalog numbers 9722 and 9721, respectively), TRS1 999 [37], or actin (A2066; Sigma), were used according to the manufacturer's recommendations. raw data was analyzed using the included Rotor-Gene Q series software. RT-qPCR was performed on serial 10-fold dilutions of a PKR containing plasmid from 106 to 101 copies of PKR to generate a standard curve. rhesus and human PKR are 90.8% and 83.2% identical at the amino acid level, respectively. rhesus and human PKR are 90.8% and 83.2% identical at the amino acid level.
