considered as an apigenin dimer linked by a C3\u2032-C8\u2032\u2032 covalent bond. amentoflavone is a polyphenolic compound originating from nature. it exists in a large number of plants, including Calophyllaceae, Clusiaceae, Cupressaceae, Euphorbiaceae, and Selaginellaceae families. androsace umbellata Primulaceae whole plants [16] 7 Antidesma bunius Phyllanthaceae leaves [17] 8 Antidesma

effects on productions of superoxide anion and total reactive oxygen species (ROS) inphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-stimulated human neutrophils. in rat astrocytoma cell line, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) could increase NO, ROS, malondialdehyde (MDA), and decrease reduced-glutathione. amentoflavone could inhibit the increases of interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, TNF-, and PGE2 induced by phytohaemagglutinin. amentoflavone could effectively scavenge center dot O2, DPPH, ABTS+ radicals. fatty acid synthase (FASN) has been considered as a potential target to treat cancer. some studies indicated that amentoflavone could inhibit FASN expression in human breast carcinoma SKBR3 cells. inhibition decreased translocation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP-1) in SKBR3 cells. amentoflavone could inhibit the activation of ERK without affecting ERK protein level, p38, and JNK activation. the biflavonoid could decrease phospho-c-Jun and c-Fos protein expressions. anti-diabetes Amentoflavone was observed to ameliorate glucose disorder, regulate insulin secretion, and restore the pancreas. amentoflavone was found to inhibit severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoA) with IC50 value of 8.3 M. the effect was concluded relative to the inhibition of chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) amentoflavone exerted neuroprotective activity in pilocarpine-induced epileptic mice. the active compound was able to restore the reduced superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, glutathione reductase (GR) activity and glutathione content. adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) phosphodiesterase inhibitor has been found to inhibit the activity of cAMP-PDE-3 in myocardial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells. cAMP-PDE-3 could enhance myocardial contraction, expand peripheral vessels, and improve hemodynamics of heart failure patients. amentoflavone showed a potent inhibitory function on cAMP-PDE-3. hepatoprotection [184], osteogenesis effect

E-2 (PGE-2), and the nuclear translocation of c-Fos anti-Tumor Amentoflavone exerts good cytotoxic effect on cervical adenocarcinoma (HeLa) cells with IC50 values of 20.7 M. some marks of mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis were observed. fatty acid synthase (FASN) has been considered as a potential target to treat cancer. biflavonoid down-regulates HER2 protein and mRNA, up-regulates polyoma enhancer activator 3 (PEA3), a transcriptional repressor of HER2 and inhibits phosphorylation of protein kinase B (PKB), mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (c-JNK) in normal human fibroblasts amentoflavone was screened to inhibit PTP1B with IC50 value of 7.3 0.5 M. it was a non-competitive inhibitor of PTP1B by kinetic study. amentoflavone exhibited its anti-dengue potential in a screening experiment. amentoflavone showed good performance with IC50 values of 119 M [102] and 5.5 g/mL [120], respectively. the active biflavonoid showed the antidepressant and anxiolytic effects through interactions with the receptors above. effects on the Cardiovascular System Amentoflavone were tested to have a vasorelaxant effect on thoracic aortic blood vessels of rats in vitro. amentoflavone showed a potent inhibitory function on cAMP-PDE-3 in myocardial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells. antifungal activity Amentoflavone was investigated to have antifungal activity against several pathogenic fungal strains. in Candida albicans, it could stimulate the intracellular trehalose accumulation and disrupt the dimorphic transition. further research on its anti-candida mechanism suggested that this active phytochemical arrested cell cycles during the S-phase and inhibited cell proliferation and division. oriasis Imiquimod Male BALBc Mice Reduced skinfold thickening Improved erythema and scaling scores, histological lesions Suppressed increases of TNF-, IL-17A, IL-22, IL-23. amentoflavone was administrated to rats with different types including oral gavage (po, 300 mg/kg), intravenous (iv, 10 mg/kg) and intraperitoneal (ip, 10 mg/kg) injection. as a representative biflavonoid with several pharmacological functions, amentoflavone was not an exception. amentoflavone is a bioactive biflavonoid with a variety of pharmacological effects, which has been derived from many natural plants. however, bioactivity in vitro is unable to represent and explain biological effect in vivo. amentoflavone metabolism procedure was very rapid and there was also a very low bioavailability after oral administration of this biflavonoid in rats. this may be one reason why fewer animal model experiments have been performed. amentoflavone has been found, isolated, and identified in over 120 natural plants. we can make full use of amentoflavone as a drug and employ it in the prevention and treatment of diseases. this paper has provided a full-scale profile of amentoflavone on its plant sources, natural derivatives, pharmacology, and pharmacokinetics."}
