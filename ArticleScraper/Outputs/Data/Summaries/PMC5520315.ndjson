{"summary": "the greatest burden of disease is located in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) by far, the greatest burden of disease is located in KSA, and most cases in other countries have not resulted in large satellite epidemics. dromedary camels are the major reservoir host,3, 4, 5, 6 from which human infections may sporadically occur through zoonotic transmission. males were more affected than females in SK, comprising 59% of total laboratory-confirmed cases21 and 66.7% case fatalities. prevention measures including placing over 3000 people in quarantine and closing 700 schools were implemented for outbreak control. data were missing for 113 cases for all variables,24 36 cases for age, 49 cases for sex, 19 cases for fatality, 20 cases for healthcare worker status, 121 cases for comorbidity and six cases for contact history in SK. data were used to plot epidemic curves. there was a higher frequency of males among cases in KSA (741 of 1137, 65.2%) than in SK (110 of 186, 59.1%); however, no significant differences in sex distribution were found between the two countries. the overall CFR was 19.2% (228 fatalities of 1186 cases) in KSA. 197/657 (30.0%) 14/35 (40.0%) Contact history Camel-linked 59/1186 (5.0%) 0/186 (0%) NA Hospital-linked 158/1186 (13.3%) 175/186 (94.1%) 0.001 Community-linked 245/1186 (20.7%) 6/186 (3.2%) 0.001 Camel and sheep-linked 6/1186 (0.5%) 0/186 (0%) NA Camel and community-linked 2/1186 (0.2%) 0/186 (0%) NA Un n=59, 5.0%), sheep and sheep products (n=5, 0.4%), nosocomial MERS cases or hospitals having MERS outbreak (n=158, 13.3%), diseased family members or friends (n=245, 20.7%), and a majority had unknown risk factors (n=710, 59.9%). in SK, most cases had a contact history in hospital facilities (n=175, 94.1%), whereas only six cases (3.2%) were infected of 1299 laboratory-confirmed MERS cases in SK with 186 cases in SK from 2012 to 2015, by using publicly available data. SK had a predominantly nosocomial transmission pattern, with >90% of cases acquiring infection in the health system. despite the large difference in nosocomial cases between SK and KSA, the rate of healthcare worker cases was not significantly different between countries. the predominance of male cases may also be associated with the high prevalence of smoking, particularly in middle-aged males in the Republic of Korea. however, the association between smoking and MERS-CoV infection requires more supportive evidence. there have been no epidemics to date in SK or other countries arising from mass gatherings. a range of hospitalized patients, healthcare workers and family members were exposed during this period, thus leading to the nosocomial disease outbreak in SK. an unreported sequence was detected in the MERS-CoV circulating in SK,41 thus suggesting increased genetic variability and mutation rates during the outbreak in 2015. the fatalities calculated in this analysis totaled 228 cases with a CFR of 19%, a value different from that reported by the Saudi MOH (43%). this difference may be due to incomplete information of deaths provided by Saudi MOH at the time. multiple introductions may comprise a mix of animal-to-human, human-to-human and other modes of transmission. a large proportion of KSA cases have unknown exposure, thus warranting further study."}
