{"summary": "a retrospective cohort study of herpes zoster infections in dermatomyositis/polymyositis patients was performed. patients were matched by gender and the type of myositis, age at myositis onset and disease duration. zoster diagnosis had reduced levels of postherpetic neuralgia. chloroquine diphosphate could predispose patients with dermatomyositis/polymyositis to developing herpes zoster. fardet et al. (13) analyzed the incidence, risk factors, and severity of HZ in 121 patients with DM/PM. the authors evaluated HZ and herpes simplex in 279 patients with DM/PM for a period of 13 years. photosensitive, calcinosis, and vasculitis were analyzed. gastrointestinal (dysphagia) and respiratory (dyspnea on moderate exertion) manifestations were analyzed. autoantibodies against cellular components were determined. herpes zoster information HZ infection was clinically defined by the appearance of the typical vesicular eruption distributed in a dermatome. the potential complications included postherpetic neuralgia (persistence of pain for more than one month after the disappearance of the rash) all of the lesions were initially evaluated by rheumatologists and then by dermatologists from our service. p0.05 was considered statistically significant. 230 consecutive patients with DM or PM were treated at a tertiary hospital. a control group of 48 patients was formed and matched by gender, disease type, age at the onset of myositis and disease duration. autoantibody anti-Jo-1 was determined using the Western blotting method. all of the patients were first started on corticosteroids (prednisone 1 mg/kg/day, administered orally), which were tapered gradually according to clinical and laboratory stability. the following drugs were used alone or in combination for corticosteroid sparing. /PM diagnosis and the season in which the HZ event occurred, while the clinical manifestations considered were those presenting during the follow-up of these patients. constitutional symptoms, skin changes (e.g., heliotrope, Gottron's papules, ulcers, photosensitive, calcinosis, and vasculitis), joint involvement (arthralgia and/or arthritis) manifestations were analyzed. herpes zoster information HZ infection was clinically defined by the appearance of the typical vesicular eruption distributed in a dermatome. the potential complications included postherpetic neuralgia (persistence of pain for more than one month after the disappearance of the rash) all of the lesions were initially evaluated by rheumatologists and then by dermatologists from our service. the sex- and age-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were calculated using an unconditional logistic model. p0.05 was considered statistically significant. 0.766 DM: dermatomyositis;
