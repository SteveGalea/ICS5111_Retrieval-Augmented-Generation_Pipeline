{"summary": "acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia (AFOP) was first described by Beasley in 2002. some case reports of patients aged from 38 d to 80 years have been published worldwide. but there is still no standard therapy for this disease and the treatment methods remain controversial. genesis of AFOP remains unclear, and there is still no standard treatment. steroid monotherapy was reported to be effective, but the information on dosage, duration and side-effects is not available. 81-year-old retired female doctor was admitted to our hospital with dry cough, and breathlessness for 1 mo. the patient was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and anti-fungal therapy in the following 2 wk. but her symptoms of cough and chest tightness, and shortness of breath were not relieved. the repeat CT scan of the chest 2 wk later showed that her condition was significantly advanced, which means a previous misdiagnosis. anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were within normal limits. arterial blood gas analysis at room air revealed pH 7.4, PaO2 63 mmHg and PaCO2 35 mmHg. pulmonary function test revealed moderate restrictive ventilatory impairment. pathological examinations revealed numerous fibrin and organizing tissue in the alveoli without pulmonary hyaline membrane, the fibrous tissue hyperplasia in the alveolar septum. no necrosis or granulomas were observed, neither any evidence of diffuse alveolar damage. repeated chest CT scan revealed almost normal findings after 3 wk. repeated chest computed tomography scan after 1 wk steroid treatment showed significant improvement, and bilateral lesions almost disappeared. there is still no standard treatment for AFOP. therapy with steroids alone or combined with immunosuppressants was attempted. the dosage and duration of steroid treatment are still unclear. steroid was prescribed as soon as the diagnosis was established. the patient was an 81-year-old woman and had a good response to short-term steroid treatment. the last follow-up showed that no relapse occurred during tapering steroids. provide a new choice of dosage and duration of it. further studies are needed to describe various clinical aspects of this rare disease."}
