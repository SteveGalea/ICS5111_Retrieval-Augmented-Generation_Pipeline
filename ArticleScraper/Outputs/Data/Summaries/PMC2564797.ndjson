{"summary": "1 Adenoviruses, influenza A and B viruses, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, coronavirus and rhinoviruses have previously been identified as causes of ARD among military populations. a significant proportion of illness (over 40%) has been attributed to unknown causative agents, probably unidentified respiratory viruses. the study was designed to enrol subjects over a period of 6 months, concurrent with annual epidemics of RSV infections among civilian populations. the study was designed to enrol subjects over a period of 6 months, from the beginning of November 2000 until the end of April 2001. six tissue culture cell lines were used, including HEp2 human epithelial cells, primary rhesus monkey kidney cells, MRC5 human lung fibroblasts. multiple cell lines were used to facilitate the detection of a variety of respiratory viruses including RSV, influenza viruses A and B, parainfluenza viruses (PIV 1, 2 and 3, adenovirus, enterovirus and herpes simplex viruses (HSV 1 and 2) realtime PCR was performed in triplicate on samples positive for the presence of RSV to determine a mean cycle threshold (Ct) value. results Over an 11 week period (early January to late March 2001), 54 symptomatic trainees were enrolled into the study from 134 recruits who met the case definition. ea 8 (22) 3.1 [1\u20139] Clinical impact Absence from training (1 days) 36 (97) 3.8 [1\u20137] Training recycling 10 (27) n = number of trainees. one or more viruses were isolated and identified by viral culture in 29 of the 54 participants (54%) assay can detect both virion RNA and viral mRNA. the prevalence of RSV among the participants was determined to be 14%. three recruits of 38 (8%) positive for a respiratory virus were different to the three recruits of 54 (6%) positive by PCR. civilian population of young adults determined a prevalence of 7%. most trainees experienced an upper respiratory tract illness lasting several days. 60% reported the occurrence of wheeze of a few days duration. most recruits experienced upper respiratory tract symptoms and some reported symptoms of lower respiratory tract disease. 21% of those with confirmed adenovirus infection were hospitalized with pneumonia. adenoviruses have been recognized as an important cause of ARD among young adults undergoing basic military training since 1954. the present study provides preliminary data for debate concerning the relevance of such a programme in British recruits. inactivated influenza vaccines have been shown to be safe, immunogenic and highly efficacious at reducing febrile respiratory illness caused by influenza in adult populations. conflict of interest Dr Gray serves on the Data Monitoring Committee for Duramed Inc., the manufacturer of adenovirus vaccines. the authors thank Dr John Graham (Royal Army Medical Corps) for support in the establishment of this collaborative study.
