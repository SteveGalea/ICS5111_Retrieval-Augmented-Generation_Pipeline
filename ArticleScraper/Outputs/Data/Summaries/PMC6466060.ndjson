{"summary": "porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) causes severe enteric illness of swine. infection results in watery diarrhea, vomiting, and anorexia. virus replicates efficiently in enterocytes lining the villi of the small intestine, leading to cell death and severe villous atrophy. the interaction between S and M requires the ERRS. the ERRS comprises the tyrosine-dependent motif (Yxx; is a hydrophobic residue) and the KxHxx motif at the C-terminus of S. however, it remains unknown how S could escape the ER\u2013Golgi retention signal. human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (Huh-7, JCRB cell bank 0403) were cultured in Opti-MEM. all culture media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and an antibiotic/mycotic. titration was performed on veroE6-APN or Huh-7 cells. the full-length S of PEDVYN144 (SYN144; GenBank KT021232.1) and PEDVG2 (SG2) were codon optimized for high expression in mammalian cells, synthesized, and cloned in the pUC57 cloning vector. the synthetic gene was designed to be flanked by MluI and NotI restriction sites to facilitate the cloning into pCAGGS expression plasmid. pSMART-BAC-PEDVmCherry bearing each S was constructed by replacing the PacI\u2013MluI fragment of the pTZ-GH with that of the infectious cDNA clone. at 24 h, cells were washed with 1 PBS and maintained in media without FBS. immunofluorescence assay VeroE6-APN cells were grown on coverslips in six-well plates and transfected with pCAGGS expressing PEDV S (1.5 g) at 24 hpt, cells were carefully detached, fixed with 4% PFA, and blocked in blocking buffer (2% FBS and 0.5% BSA in PBS) for 1 h. ER marker (Abcam) was used as a non-permeabilized condition control. cells were washed with PBS and incubated with anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 647 (IgG H + L) antibodies for 1 h. human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (Huh-7, JCRB cell bank 0403) were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) low glucose. all culture media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and an antibiotic/mycotic (ThermoScientific) the full-length S of PEDVYN144 (SYN144; GenBank KT021232.1) and PEDVG2 (SG2) were codon optimized for high expression in mammalian cells, synthesized, and cloned in the pUC57 cloning vector. the synthetic gene was designed to be flanked by MluI and NotI restriction sites to facilitate the cloning into the modified pCAGGS expression plasmid. the full-length pSMART-BAC-PEDVmCherry bearing each S was then constructed by replacing the PacI\u2013MluI fragment of the pTZ-GH with that of the infectious cDNA clone. at 24 h, cells were washed with 1 PBS and maintained in media without FBS. Flow Cytometry HEK293T cells were seeded in six-well plates and transfected with pCAGGS expressing PEDV S (1.5 g) at 24 hpt, cells were carefully detached, fixed with 4% PFA, and blocked in blocking buffer (2% FBS and 0.5% BSA in PBS) for 1 h. Western Blot Analysis Cells were lysed with mammalian cell lysis buffer. lysates were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. membrane was blocked in 5% dry powdered milk and incubated with mouse anti-PEDV. we synthesized codon-optimized SYN144, cloned into the pCAGGS expression vector and evaluated the cell\u2013cell fusion activity in transfected cells. without trypsin treatment, no syncytia were observed. the absence of the C-terminal motifs resulted in the induction of syncytium formation in transfected cells. formation of syncytia in veroE6 cells stably expressing porcine aminopeptidase N (VeroE6-APN) expressing porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) S derived from YN144 and G2 corroborates notion that changes during serial passages may enable the S protein to trigger cell\u2013cell fusion in cultured cells. both SG2ERRS and SYN144ERRS showed comparably strong surface expression. despite the apparent syncytium formation, the inclusion of the C-terminal motifs to SYN144 resulted in a substantial decrease in surface expression. SG2 containing the intact C-terminal motifs also showed hardly detectable surface expression. cells were incubated with goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 647 (IgG H+L) antibodies. an anti-calreticulin endoplasmic reticulum marker was used as a non-permeabilized condition control. to this end, we constructed the chimeric SYN144 harboring the RBD and S1/S2 derived from SG2 (SYN-G2) and the SG2 carrying the RBD and S1/S2 of SYN western blot analysis of HEK293T cells transfected with pCAGGS expressing SYN144, SG2, SYN-G2 or SG2-YN. amino acids in the RBD and S1/S2 of PEDV S could influence induction of cell\u2013cell fusion in veroE6-APN cells. RBD and S1/S2 of chimeric S variants were replaced with those of SG2A and SG2B. we also examined the syncytium-inducing property of chimeric S variants. we found that veroE6-APN cells transfected with SG2B exhibited extensive syncytium formation. cells expressing SG2A with A475S and V672F showed remarkably large syncytia. syncytia in SG2-V672F-transfected cells were smaller than those transfected with SG2A. VeroE6-APN cells were transfected with pCAGGS expressing SG2A, SG2A-V672F, and SG2A-A475S-V672F. at 24 hpt, cells were evaluated for syncytium formation. porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) was initially identified as a natural receptor of PEDV [20,21,22], several recent studies demonstrated that neither the overexpression, nor the complete knockout of APN affects PEDV infectivity in cultured cells. to this end, we transfected pCAGGS expressing S of various constructs into parental veroE6-APN cells and examined the syncytium formation. syncytia could be detected in Huh-7 cells transfected with all chimeric S constructs including the SG2A that could not trigger cell\u2013cell fusion in veroE6 cells. syncytium formation in Huh-7 cells transfected with pCAGGS expressing SG2. PEDV with the wild-type SG2 grew poorly with undetectable syncytia. the virus carrying the V672F mutation showed clear syncytium formation. both recombinant viruses could grow in Huh-7 cells with comparable growth kinetics. recombinant PEDV bearing SG2, SG2-V672F, SYN144, and SYN144 with F672V substitution in veroE6-APN and Huh-7 cells. a well-characterized cell-adapted PEDV in the GII genogroup. it replicates efficiently in mammalian cells, but exhibits a highly syncytial phenotype. the absence of the C-terminal motifs resulted in the induction of notably larger syncytium formation in transfected cells. syncytium formation was evaluated under a light microscope at 24 h post transfection. syncytium formation was assessed at 24 hpt. Scale 100 m. 3.2. SG2ERRS failed to induce syncytium formation in transfected cells. the protein expression at the cell surface was disturbed by this modification. HEK293T cells were transfected with pCAGGS expressing indicated PEDV S. at 24 hpt, cells were subjected to immunofluorescence analysis under permeabilized and non-permeabilized conditions. the samples were mounted on slides with DAPI. each construct was evaluated for its ability to trigger syncytia in transfected cells. the absence of syncytia in cells transfected with SG2-YN was not due to a defect in protein expression. western blot analysis showed relatively high protein expression of all constructs. western blot analysis of HEK293T cells transfected with pCAGGS expressing SYN144, SG2, SYN-G2 or SG2-YN. mouse anti-PEDV S1 and \u2013 actin antibodies were used to detect protein expression in cell lysates harvested 48 hpt. veroE6-APN cells were transfected with pCAGGS expressing the chimeric SG2A and SG2B. at 24 hpt, cells were evaluated for syncytium formation. pCAGGS was used to stain nuclei. Arrows denote the formation of the syncytium. the wild-type SG2 could not trigger detectable syncytium in transfected cells. syncytia in SG2-V672F-transfected cells were smaller than those transfected with SG2A-V672F. syncytia in SG2-V672F-transfected cells were smaller than those transfected with SG2A-V672F. veroE6-APN cells were transfected with pCAGGS expressing wild-type SG2, SG2-V672F, SG2-A475S, and SG2-A475S-V672F. at 24 hpt, cells were evaluated for syncytium formation. Arrows denote the formation of the syncytium. syncytium formation in veroE6 cells expressing PEDV S. pCAGGS expressing SG2A, SG2B, and SG2A-V672F showed undetectable syncytium formation. in Huh-7 and veroE6 cells expressing PEDV S were transfected with pCAGGS expressing SYN144, SG2A, SG2A-V672F, and SG2. at 24 hpt, cells were examined for syncytium formation. rgPEDV-AVCT12mCherry-SG2-V672F cells were adsorbed with supernatants harvested from HEK293T cells. the expression of mCherry was assessed by fluorescence microscopy at indicated times after adsorption. we investigated the ability of PEDV S to induce syncytium formation in veroE6 cells using those that derived from a field isolate (G2) and a cell-adapted variant (YN144) the syncytium formation is usually triggered as a result of the binding between S on the infected cells\u2019 surface and its receptor on adjacent cells. however, it is not clear how S, especially of cell-adapted strains, could transit to the plasma membrane. a single amino acid substitution at position 672 in the RBD from valine to phenylalanine (V672F) could render PEDV S of a typical field isolate to mediate cell\u2013cell fusion in VeroE6-APN cells. the recombinant PEDV bearing SG2 with V672F mutation also replicated efficiently in veroE6-APN cells. this finding thus points to the possibility that S might interact with different receptors on Huh-7 the majority amino acid at the position 672 of GII PEDV S is valine (V672) with less than 5% of available data showing phenylalanine (F672) and isoleucine (I672) this specific residue is unlikely to be the result of adaptive mutations that occurred during serial passages. strains may be more efficiently propagated in vero or veroE6 cells compared to those carrying S with V672. a single V672F substitution could render PEDV carrying S derived from a poorly culturable isolate to trigger large syncytia."}
