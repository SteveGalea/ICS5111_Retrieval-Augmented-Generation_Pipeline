{"summary": "G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily constitutes the largest family of receptors in cell responsible for mediating the effects of over 50% of drugs in the market now-a-days. there are three main classes of GPCRs (A, B and C) depending on their sequence similarity to Rhodopsin (Rho) (Class A) 1-ARs in kidneys stimulate the release of renin, thereby playing a role in the activation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. -blockers represent first line therapy for the management of chronic heart failure, hypertension, acute and post myocardial infarction patients, chronic stable angina, and unstable angina. computer-aided drug design (CADD) is based on the knowledge of structure, either of the receptor, or that of the ligand. homology modeling is a widely used in silico technique providing the useful structural models for generating hypotheses about a protein's function and directing further experimental work. stereochemical properties of modeled protein structure were validated by PROCHECK [21], Verify3D [22] and ERRAT [23]. Molecular docking experiments were conducted by Surflex-Dock implemented in SYBYL [24], FRED (Version 2.2.5) [25] and GOLD [26]. UCSF CHIMERA [27\u201328] and MOE [29] were used for visualization purpose. confined ballesteros and Weinstein numbering scheme was used to identify the transmembrane (TM) segments relative to the conserved position of amino acids in TM helices assigned as locant.50. the immediately preceding and following the residue are numbered.49 and.51. a homology model was generated by ORCHESTRAR that lacks a region of 45 amino acid residues. this region was modeled by I-TASSER, an integrated platform for automated protein structure and function. the model generated by I-TASSER was named as sub-model 1. re-docking and cross-docking experiments were performed by Surflex-Dock, FRED, and GOLD. selection of complexes was based on following criteria: availability of protein-ligand complexes, crystallographic resolution of protein-ligand complexes should be 3. 5 2Y00 2.5 Meleagris gallopovo ADR1 Y00 7 -6.240.04 [35] 7 2Y02 2.6 Meleagris gallopovo ADR1 WHJ 7 -8.370.07 [35] 8 2Y03 2.85 Meleagris gallopovo ADR1 5FW 4 -7.860.10 [35] 9 2Y04 3.05 Meleagris gallopovo ADR1 68H 5 cross-docking experiments were conducted to identify which docking program exactly identified its cognate ligand among the diverse set of ligands within the top-ranked solution. the results were quantified as Best (1\u20133 position), Moderate (4\u20135 position) and Worst when the cognate ligand ranks position lower than 5 within its cognate protein. hsADR1 (AC No: P08588) was retrieved from UniProt KB [30] to search the closest homologue. top-ranked template sequences as determined by BLAST were subjected for multiple sequence alignment on basis of optimized E-value of the specified target sequence. 2RH1 CAU 418 79% 54% 76% 510-92 10 3PDS ERC 410 72% 60% 78% 110-90 *Y00 = Dobutamine, P32 = Cyanopindolol, CAU = Carazolol, ERC = FAUC50. confined ballesteros and Weinstein numbering scheme was used to identify the transmembrane segments relative to the conserved position of amino acids in TM helices assigned as locant. five sub-models were evaluated by replica-exchange Monte Carlo simulations with low free-energy states, spatial restrains and alignments TM regions [34] to identify the best structural alignment almost closed to the structural analogs on the basis of structural similarity. the final results of all sub-models were based on sequence-structure-function paradigm obtained from the consensus of structural similarity and confidence score (C-score) of I-TASSER server. the details of the protein-ligand complexes used in this study are summarized in Table 2 and S1 Fig. cross-docking experiments conducted using multiple docking methods with their scoring function are used in this study mentioned in S2, S3 and S4 Tables. opovo ADR1 WHJ 7 -8.370.07 [35] 8 2Y03 2.85 Meleagris gallopovo ADR1 5FW 4 -7.860.10 [35] 9 2Y04 3.05 Meleagris gallopovo ADR1 68H 5 -5.250.04 [35] 10 3D4S 2.8 Homo sapiens ADR2 TIM 7 -5.550.14 [55] 11 3NY8 2. cross-docking experiments conducted in using multiple docking methods with their scoring function are used in this study mentioned in S2, S3 and S4 Tables. the details of docking methodology are discussed in supporting informations. RMSDs were calculated between the corresponding co-crystallized ligand against its predicted docked pose. cross-docking results were quantified as Best (1\u20133 position), Moderate (4\u20135 position) and Worst when the cognate ligand ranks position lower than 5 within its cognate protein. 2R4R, 3KJ6, 3P0G and 2RH1 have 79%, while 2R4S and 3SN6 have 74% query coverage. the complexes 3P0G, 2RH1 and 3SN6 were not used for the modeling of hsADR1 structure due to their lower scores. the average alignment score for manually edited multiple sequence alignment is better (76.47) than the score obtained by raw multiple sequence alignment (74.89). overall, there are 15 instances where alignments are improved, 7 alignments are improved when the target sequence is aligned with the rest of the sequences.
