{"summary": "discovery human bocavirus (HBoV) was discovered in 2005 by allander et al.. HBoV was classified as a bocavirus and therefore provisionally named human bocavirus. parvovirus 4 has not yet been assigned to a genus, but it was proposed to allocate it to the genus Hokovirus. it shares more similarities to the novel porcine and bovine hokoviruses than with other parvoviruses. HBoV2 was found in stool samples from Pakistani children as well as in samples from Edinburgh. one ORF encodes a non-structural protein (NS1) and a second one at least two capsid proteins (VP1 and VP2) the third ORF encodes a non-structural protein (NP1) the function of HBoV NS1 is unknown. a role in apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and transactivation of cellular genes has been described for parvovirus B19 NS1 [13,14,15,16]. tozer et al. established a highly sensitive real-time PCR assay targeting the NP1 and the VP1 gene. HBoV can be detected indirectly via detection of antibodies to HBoV. this method has also been performed with different ELISAs using virus-like-particles. HBoV has been detected throughout the whole year, with peak seasons varying from year to year and from study to study. HBoV has been detected mostly in fall and winter months. HBoV has been detected mostly in fall and winter months. HBoV and gastroenteric infections MVC and BPV are also known to cause gastrointestinal infections in dogs and calves. the role of HBoV in gastroenteritis outbreaks in day care facilities is still unclear. HBoV DNA was found in serum/whole blood [28,59,29] and one study reports detection in urine [70]. it remains unclear if the detection of HBoV in serum indicates viremia or if HBoV targets blood cells. HBoV DNA was not detected in bone marrow of HIV-infected individuals. or at least in vitro models demonstrate its pathogenicity."}
