{"summary": "Background Bocaviruses are classified as a genus within the Parvoviridae family of single-stranded DNA viruses. two species have been previously reported in dogs, minute virus of canines, associated with neonatal diseases and fertility disorders. canine bocavirus (CBoV), associated with respiratory disease. minutes virus of canines (MVC) was the first known bocavirus infecting dogs. the second species of dog bocavirus (Canine bocavirus, CBoV) was identified in 2011 in respiratory samples from diseased and healthy dogs. BLASTx E 10-3) was initially identified by 454 pyrosequencing. the sequence was extended by degenerate PCR targeting conserved bocavirus regions, yielding a 2.5 kb partial genome sequence. the tissue nucleic acids were further analyzed using the MiSeq Illumina platform. bocaviruses are believed to replicate through the parvovirus rolling hairpin model. recent experimental evidence showed the presence of head-to-tail concatemers or circularized genomes of human bocavirus (HBoV) 1&3 [18,19] and porcine bocaviruses [20], indicating some bocaviruses may use a rolling - circle replication model. inverse PCR amplicons and plasmid inserts were Sanger sequenced using protocol for GC-rich/hairpin sequences. the resulting sequences were aligned and the length of the region between the VP stop and the NS start codon calculated. the longest NTR sequence (506 nt) showed that the long palindromic hairpin terminal repeats were missing. canine circovirus infection can lead to lymphocytic depletion and immunosuppression in the host. a dog suffering from vomiting and hemorrhagic gastroenteritis was euthanized. the resulting near complete genome of CnBoV3 was deposited in GenBank with accession no. KC580640. Phylogenetic analyses based on aligned amino acid sequences from full-length VP proteins were generated by the neighbor joining method in MEGA [25], using amino acid p-distances."}
