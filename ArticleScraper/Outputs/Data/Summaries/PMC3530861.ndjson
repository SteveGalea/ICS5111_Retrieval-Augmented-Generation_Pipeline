Kidney function tests were notable for a blood urea nitrogen of 4.3 mmol/L and a the patient was initially diagnosed with community acquired pneumonia complicated by parapneumonic effusion. a chest tube was inserted to drain the effusion, then a second thoracotomy. the patient stabilized from a surgical point of view and was discharged in a good condition. his chest X-ray on discharge showed significant improvement. pulmonary syphilis was considered after ruling out most common causes of plural effusion. this diagnosis becomes more probable if the patient does not initially respond to wide spectrum antibiotics. 11 cases of pulmonary involvement in the presentation of secondary syphilis since 1966. a patient presenting with lung infiltrates and pleural effusion that later is associated with fever has a wide differential diagnosis for pulmonary involvement secondary to syphilis. pulmonary syphilis may find itself higher on the differential diagnosis for such patients."}
