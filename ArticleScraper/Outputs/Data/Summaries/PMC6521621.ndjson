{"summary": "the HIV-1 envelope (Env) protein is synthesized as a gp160 precursor at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) the mature gp120/gp41 trimer travels to the plasma membrane where it joins HIV-1 Gag proteins, forming infectious virus particles (reviewed in [1]. characterization of bnAb epitopes on the Env protein and the elucidation of the B cell generation of bnAbs. some antiviral antibodies are able to recruit natural killer (NK) cells through engaging the FC receptor, and kill HIV-1 infected cells by antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. nucleases such as adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADAR) and apoliprotein B editing complex 3 (APOBEC3) proteins that edit and mutate the viral genome. factors such as myxovirus resistance 1, 2 (Mx1, Mx2), and Tripartite motif-containing protein 5 (Trim5) that target the replication complex of viral genome and block viral multiplication. restriction factors operate in virus producer cells and inhibit Env synthesis at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in virus target cells, IFITM2/IFITM3 and 25-HC deter viral entry. one ER protein, called ERManI, has been shown to promote degradation of ER-associated proteins by ERAD. GH47 -mannosidases mediate trimming of -1,2-mannose residues from Man9GlcNAc2. ERManl interacts with HIV-1 Env via its luminal catalytic domain. mutation of catalytic sites ablates its activity in degrading HIV-1 Env protein. ERAD-mediated degradation of HIV-1 Env can be exploited for therapeutic purposes. one example is the depletion of HIV-1 gp160 precursor from the ER via the ERAD pathway by an engineered molecule called degradin. the small peptide glycine-prolyl-glycine amide abolishes HIV-1 infectivity by targeting viral Env to the ERAD pathway for degradation. members of the GBP family have been reported to antagonize a variety of invading pathogens including viruses, bacteria, and protozoa [35]. GBP1, a protein that is closely related to GBP5, inhibits a number of viruses including dengue virus, hepatitis C virus (HCV), encephalomyocarditis virus, and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) [36,37] HIV-1 has a \u201ctrade-off\u201d mechanism to partially overcome GBP5 inhibition. shutting down Vpu expression increases Env expression, which confers partial resistance to GBP5. the 90K protein (also known as LGAL3SBP) is an IFN-inducible, secreted immunostimulatory glycoprotein. both GBP5 and 90K are highly expressed in macrophages. 90K also affects the furin-dependent maturation of Ebola GP. the inhibitory effect of 90K on HIV-1 Env might be indirect. IFITM3 is a member of the IFITM family, including IFITM1, IFITM2, IFITM3, and IFITM10. among these, IFITM1, 2, and 3 are interferon-inducible. IFITM3 impairs gp160 cleavage, promotes gp120 shedding, and diminishes the level of mature gp120/gp41 in HIV-1 particles. MARCH8 regulates its ubiquitination, trafficking, and turnover. MARCH8 also targets viral envelope proteins and downregulates them from the cell surface. MARCH8 removes HIV-1 Env from the cell surface, which is retained within lysosomes. MARCH1 and MARCH2 are also localized at the plasma membrane. MARCH1 and MARCH2 are also localized at the plasma membrane. but virion incorporation of MARCH2 remains controversial. ERManI is a class I -mannosidase and belongs to the glycosidehydrolase family 47 (GH47) -mannosidases, which are carbohydrate-active enzymes. ERManl interacts with HIV-1 Env via its luminal catalytic domain. mutation of catalytic sites ablates its activity in degrading HIV-1 Env protein. viral countermeasures of ERManI have not been reported. however, HIV-1 Vpr has been shown to increase Env expression. it remains to be determined whether Vpr directly interacts with ERManI to save Env from degradation at the ER. products of three interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), GBP5 (guanylate binding protein 5), 90K, and IFITM2/3 (IFN-induced transmembrane protein 2 and 3) have been shown to obstruct gp160 cleavage and diminish the incorporation of functional mature gp120/gp41 trimers into virions [31,32,33] members of the GBP family have been reported to antagonize a variety gp160 cleavage is impaired, and glycosylation of HIV-1 Env is altered. it is currently unclear whether this altered glycosylation has contributed to the impaired cleavage of gp160. this anti-HIV-1 function appears to be specific to GBP5. 90K inhibits both R5 and X4 HIV viruses. both GBP5 and 90K are highly expressed in macrophages. inhibition of 90K on HIV-1 Env might be indirect. 90K impairs gp160 processing and reduces levels of gp120 on the plasma membrane in other species, including the rhesus macaque. the antiviral function of 90K is conserved among primates except the rhesus macaque. however, these functions do not always reduce the infectivity of nascent HIV-1 virions. MARCH8 is one of the 11 members of the MARCH family of RING-finger E3 ubiquitin ligases. MARCH8 is involved in downregulating multiple transmembrane proteins. MARCH8 regulates its ubiquitination, trafficking, and turnover. MARCH8 interacts with HIV-1 Env and VSV G proteins. MARCH1 and MARCH2 have antiviral functions similar to those observed in MARCH8. MARCH1 and MARCH2 are also localized at the plasma membrane. MARCH proteins remove HIV-1 Env from the plasma membrane. it is speculated that HIV-1 takes advantage of these proteins to escape immunosurveillance. cellular factors such as IFITM3 and SERINC5 also find their way into virus particles. SERINC5 is a member of the serine incorporator (SERINC) family. it is involved in the synthesis of two serine-containing lipids. SERINC5 contains 11 transmembrane domains, and is associated with lipid rafts. anti-SERINC5 strategies from different viruses indicate its broad antiviral function. antiviral function of IFITM proteins was discovered in a genome-wide siRNA screen aiming to identify anti-HIV-1 ISGs. IFITM proteins are not the sole defense in target cells against virus entry. the YMEL motif binds to AP-2 and guides endosome localization via endocytic pathway. a soluble oxysterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC), protects target cells from viral infection. accumulating evidence suggests an upregulation of CH25H in macrophages and dendritic cells upon inflammatory stimulation. accumulation of 25-HC instead of cholesterol in the lipid membrane prevents HIV-1 Env-mediated membrane fusion. 25-HC also operates in virus-producing cells by altering the glycosylation of Lassa virus glycoprotein [92] a viral protein to target and downregulate the host restriction factor. one strategy is to increase the level of Env expression to counter host inhibition of virus entry. a second strategy is to increase the level of Env expression to counter host inhibition of virus entry. antibodies 6 months after infection transform the IFITM3-resistant HIV-1 to an IFITM3-sensitive one. a related envelope protein-mediated evasion was reported for influenza A virus [97]. HIV-1 changes Env to acquire higher replication capacity in compensating for the loss of infectivity as a result of interferon inhibition. tetherin is known to inhibit the release of HIV-1 and many other enveloped viruses by tethering the progeny virions to the cell surface. viral envelope protein under the Suppressive Pressure of both Adaptive and Innate Immunity Adaptive and innate immunity cooperate to create a higher genetic barrier for viral envelope protein to escape compared to either immune response alone. the ability of Env to evade an innate immunity might be limited by the need to resist antibody attack. a growing body of studies demonstrate that HIV-1 Env protein is not only the primary antigen of adaptive immunity but also the main target of innate immunity. the bnAbs, key effectors in adaptive immunity, are now being tested in clinical trials as a new HIV treatment. restriction factor impact on HIV-1 Env Other Enveloped Viruses Affected Virus Escape Mechanism References ErManI Decrease Env expression via ERAD pathway.
