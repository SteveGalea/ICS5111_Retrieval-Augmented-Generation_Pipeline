{"summary": "the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) gene family belongs to the immunoglobulin (Ig) gene superfamily. it comprises an exceptionally diverse array of highly glycosylated glycoproteins. in humans, the CEA family consists of 35 genes, 21 of which are protein coding. CEACAMs are either inserted into the cell membrane via a transmembrane (TM) domain or linked to the membrane via semipenetrating glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchorage. members of the CEA family are implicated in diverse physiological and pathological functions. the prototypic member of this family, human CEA, was discovered in the mid-1960s in the blood of patients with colon cancer. the prototypic member of this family, human CEA (henceforth referred to as CEACAM5), was discovered by gold and Freedman (1965) in the mid-1960s in the blood of patients with colon cancer. sequences were retrieved from publicly available nonredundant sequence databases ENSEMBL (Flicek et al. 2013), RefSeq (Pruitt et al. 2012), and UniProtKB (Magrane and UniProt Consortium 2011). to obtain more putative CEA homologs, these sequences were used as probes to perform extensive reciprocal BLASTp and tBLASTn searches of genomes with high coverage (>6) and low coverage (2) trees were reconstructed using neighbor-net method. trees generated with the ML method were illustrated with Dendroscope v.3 (Huson and Scornavacca 2012) the TM regions were predicted with the programs MINNOU (Cao et al. 2006) and PRED-TMR2 (Pasquier et al. 1999). X-ray crystal structures of the murine Ceacam1a (PDB ID: 1L6Z) and the human CEACAM1 (PDB: 2GK2) were used as templates to model the IgC-like and IgV-like domain. names or accession numbers of the characterized CEA reported in literature were used initially to retrieve their sequences from the publicly available nonredundant sequence databases ENSEMBL (Flicek et al. 2013) these sequences were used as probes to perform extensive reciprocal BLASTp and tBLASTn searches of genomes with high coverage (>6) and low coverage (2). this process was reiterated until convergence, that is, no novel putative CEA sequences could be detected. the resulting multiple sequence alignments were edited using CINEMA alignment editor (Pettifer et al. 2009) a distance-based tree (BIONJ) (Gascuel 1997) was used as seed, as well as the nearest-neighbor-interchange heuristic with five discrete gamma categories of evolutionary rates. X-ray crystal structures of the murine Ceacam1a (PDB ID: 1L6Z) and the human CEACAM1 (PDB: 2GK2) were used as templates to model the IgC-like and IgV-like domain. the predicted TM helices were modeled, template free, as described above. genomes with high coverage were selected to avoid underestimation of the number of CEA genes. the genomes with high coverage were selected to avoid underestimation of the number of CEA genes. 207 CEA protein-encoding genes, 13 pseudogenes, and 1 expressed sequence tag (EST) sequence were identified in the genomes of 20 species representing diverse eukaryotic taxonomic divisions. despite extensive database searches, CEA homologs were not detected in the complete and well-annotated genomes of aves, insects, and in lower vertebrates. cellular region of the CEA proteins, namely IgV-like, IgC-like, and TM, the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) and immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) were derived from multiple alignment of sequences that correspond to the three extracellular domains and the cytoplasmic domain. a number of conserved amino acid residues were identified. cysteines involved in the formation of the disulfide bridge are shown as a ball-and-stick representation. the disulfide bridges are indicated by yellow lines. the conserved proteins motifs are detected in the IgC-like domain. modeled 3D structures of the IgC-like domain of FrogCea2 and PlatypusCea1 superimposed onto the N-terminus of the murine Ceacam1a exhibit notable similarity in their secondary structures. the two invariant cysteine residues, which are involved in the formation of the disulfide bridge, were found to be spatially conserved in the IgC-like domain of the CEA homologs. cluster III appeared in the common ancestor of extant amniotes for the first time. cluster III contains the genes CEACAM20, CEACAM19, and CEACAM16. subsequent duplication of CEACAM21 have apparently given rise to CEACAM3\u20137 in the primate lineage. phylogenetic analyses based on the entire length protein sequences of all species under study were conducted. two different methods for phylogenetic reconstruction, ML and neighbor-net, were employed to resolve better the evolutionary relationships. CEACAM19 and CEACAM20 appear to be the primordial genes of the CEA family (fig. 5) because they were found in the common ancestor of amniotes. neither CEACAM19 nor CEACAM20 orthologs were identified in prototheria (platypus) this is probably due to incomplete genomic studies. primate-specific CEACAM1, 3\u20138 gene duplications must have occurred. the domain organization of CEACAM1, 3\u20138 is also preserved among species. a series of species-specific gene duplications must have occurred in rodents yielding 11 Psg paralogs (Cluster VI) in mouse. mouse Psg proteins harbor three IgV-like domains, whereas primate PSGs possess only one (fig. 7). in the rodent-specific cluster VII, ceacam1 and Ceacam2 cluster together with high confidence (fig. 6 and 7 supplementary figs. S1 and S2, Supplementary Material online) phylogenetic analyses of the CEA homologs in the available genomes of 33 species. we performed comprehensive and updated phylogenetic analyses of the CEA homologs in the available genomes of 33 species. this study is supported by the relatively large evolutionary distances. genomes with high coverage were selected to avoid underestimation of the number of CEA genes. 207 CEA protein-encoding genes, 13 pseudogenes, and 1 expressed sequence tag (EST) sequence were identified in the genomes of 20 species representing diverse eukaryotic taxonomic divisions. conserved proteins motifs were derived from the IgV-like domain. arginine and aspartate are shown as a ball-and-stick representation. a number of conserved amino acid residues were identified. the height of the whole pile is normalized, so it indicates the information content (measured in bits) in each position. the conserved proteins motifs are detected in the IgC-like domain, numbered according to murine Ceacam1a. superimposed structures of the IgV-like domain of the human CEACAM1 (PDB ID: 2GK2) and the murine Ceacam1a (PDB ID: 1L6Z) are conserved. the residues arginine (R64) and aspartate (D82) that form a salt bridge are also conserved. the homologous genes are arranged in clusters, with conserved sequential order, transcriptional orientation, number, and flanking genes, in all species under investigation. cluster I appeared first in the common ancestor of extant amniotes for the first time and contains a single gene, CEACAM18. cluster III appeared in the common ancestor of extant eutherians for the first time and contains a single gene, CEACAM18. the genomic boundaries of each chromosome/scaffold/contig are shown in parentheses. the non-CEA genes flanking the CEA genes are shown in dark red. the domain organization of CEA proteins is shown in the figure inset. the conventions are the same as in figure 6. neither CEACAM19 nor CEACAM20 orthologs were identified in prototheria. CEACAM1 and CEACAM3\u20138 appear to form separate monophyletic branches (albeit moderately supported) the domain organization of CEACAM1, 3\u20138 is also preserved among species (fig. 7). fig. 6 and supplementary fig. S1, Supplementary Material online. a series of species-specific gene duplications must have occurred in rodents yielding 11 Psg paralogs (Cluster VI) in mouse, which share significant sequence similarity. teleost cea protein sequences cluster in a well-supported monophyletic clade (with a bootstrap value of 91) the teleost genes detected in the contemporary teleost genomes must have been derived from a series of lineage-specific duplications. this hypothesis is supported by the relatively large evolutionary distances and the diverse domain organization of the proteins encoded by the above genes. phylogenetic reconstructions were performed with the entire length of the CEA-encoded proteins to include all the available evolutionary information. the conservation of these residues across the diverse CEA family members suggests the importance of these residues in the overall structure and function of CEA. the CEA gene family represents a notable example of gene duplication. it is suggested that successive rounds of gene duplications have likely given rise to the CEA genes found in the contemporary genomes. CEACAM1 acts as a tumor suppressor, shown to inhibit growth of prostate, colon, and breast tumors. an ITAM was also detected in the cytoplasmic tail of CEACAM19. further experimental studies could probably verify the signaling regulatory role of ITAM/ITIM in various cellular activities."}
