{"summary": "studies have detailed clinical diseases caused by the most important respiratory tract pathogens, including respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, parainfluenza, rhinovirus, and coronavirus. most reports of WUPyV have been coinfections or reported in immunosuppressed patients (4\u20137) a nasopharyngeal swab was collected and stored in transport media. an Illumina stranded-RNA sequencing library was created from isolated RNA (Zymo Direct-zol; Zymo Research, USA) a total of 95,605 reads aligned to the reference sequence NC_009539 and resulted in 99.3% coverage of the reference genome. whole-genome sequence of hPyV4/USA/AR001/2016 isolate has been deposited in GenBank under the accession number KX787894."}
