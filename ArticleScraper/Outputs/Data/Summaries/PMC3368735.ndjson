{"summary": "immunoscreenings of expression libraries via polyclonal sera on nitrocellulose membranes or screenings of whole proteome lysates in 2-D gel electrophoresis are performed. however, these methods feature some rather inconvenient disadvantages. the main route of infection and transmission is believed to be the incorrect handling and incomplete cooking of poultry. studies mention 62% of carcasses to be contaminated with Campylobacter after slaughter. a rapid point-of-care device would need a more direct approach. method to covalently attach different HaloTag\u00ae fusion proteins on HaloLinkTM slides. it reduces the formation of inclusion bodies during recombinant protein expression. this method reduces pitfall of cross-reactive signals normally encountered with screenings. the whole lysates can be spotted to the HaloLinkTM Arrays. remaining proteins from the lysates are simply washed off. the microarray platform allows for several thousand spots per slide. the longest gene under investigation, flaA demonstrated the least conformity to the respective sequence from EMBL. the length of each sequence reaction was approximately 1300 nucleotides. cfrA flaC flagellin flaC flaA flagellin flaA peb1a bifunctional adhesin/ABC transporter aspartate/glutamate-binding protein peb1a cadF OmpA-OmpF porin cadF pyrC dihydroorotase. the full names of each protein investigated are given according to the KEGG database with their coding genes. HaloTag\u00ae standard protein (HT-SP) was added as additional size reference at 60 kDa. small fragments of only HaloTag\u00ae (34 kDa) are visible. cjaA, hisJ, flaC and peb1a are approximately at the cutoff. gapA, pyrC and argC lie significantly below the cutoff value. gapA, argC and argC were significantly below the cutoff. contrast values (n = 5) are presented as a box-whisker-plot. the whiskers enclose 90% of all values (95% - 5%) and 98% of the values fall between the crosses. gapA, argC and pyrC show negative results. at least four bands are visible in the KRX whole cell lysate with a more prominent band at 70 kDa and three weaker bands at 55 kDa, 28 kDa and roughly 18 kDa respectively. the rest is clearly negative showing no signals at all. the rest is clearly negative showing no signals at all. pseB has not been described as immunogenic, although it is involved in the glycosylation of the flagellar apparatus of Campylobacter jejuni. western blot and dot blot analyses have revealed no band or signal for pseB, which is in accordance with the microarray data. whole lysates by western blot failed to discriminate between positive bands and background. however, a secure identification of true positives is difficult at best using standard western blot without previous purification methods. sensitivity may be low due to differences in expression rate and losses of protein content during purification. pFN18A Flexi vectors inhabit several intriguing features. they encode a bacterial RNase - Barnase - which is only removed during successful cloning. if cloning fails, the Barnase remains intact and leads to cell death. nitrocellulose membranes bind entire protein lysates unable to discriminate between proteins of interest and proteins from the expression host. this high background content leads to numerous false positive signals when using polyclonal sera raised against whole cells to search for new antigens. this high background content leads to numerous false positive signals when using polyclonal sera raised against whole cells to search for new antigens. regulated, offers high yields and the covalent attachment of the proteins to the surface makes separate purification obsolete as it combines spotting and purification directly. cloning to recombinant expressed proteins is first done in propagation cells such as JM109 or DH5 and then a second cloning procedure to expression cells as BL21(DE3) is performed. the method presented herein may be useful for broad screening of bacterial expression libraries to identify and detect novel immunogenic proteins. we strongly believe this to emerge as an important tool in the search for antigens, virulence factors, biomarkers and vaccine candidates. cells were harvested by centrifugation (1000 g, 10 minutes) in a benchtop centrifuge 5415 R (Eppendorf) the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of 1 PBS (1.9 mM NaH2PO4, 8.1 mM Na2HPO4, 150 mM NaCl) after a second centrifugation the pellet was resuspended in 500 l of lysis buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.5 cjaA for TAAAGCGATCGCCATGAAAAAAATACTTCTAAGTGT 53 840. cjaA rev ATTAGTTTAATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT amplification was performed in separate tubes containing a reaction mixture comprised of 2 l DNA (200 ng), 10 l 5 Phusion HF buffer, 1 l dNTPs (10 mM each), 0.5 l 50 mM MgCl2 (final concentration 2 mM each) agarose gel electrophoresis was carried out in a PerfectBlue Gelsystem Mini (Peqlab) for 90 min at 80 V. the DNA was visualized by ethidium bromide staining. reactions containing amplified genes were purified by QIAquick PCR Purification Kit. digest of vector was heated for 20 min to 65\u00b0C to inactivate both enzymes. ligated constructs of vector and gene of interest were cloned into KRX single-Step Competent Cells. clones from cryo stocks were used to inoculate 5 ml of LB-Amp. the temperature and shaking were decreased to 18\u00b0C respectively 180 rpm. lysates were spotted to HaloLinkTM Slides using the QArray2 microarray spotter (Molecular Devices) middle chamber with rabbit-polyclonal to HaloTag\u00ae (Promega, 5 g/ml) and bottom chamber with PBS only. incubation was performed for one hour under gentle rocking. slides were washed with PBSI, the ProPlateTM module was removed. c u t o f f = m e d i a n b + 5 S D b -
