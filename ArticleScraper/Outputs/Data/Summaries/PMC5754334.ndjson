{"summary": "influenza virus can cause worldwide pandemics every 10\u201340 years. the virus can undergo antigenic drift/shift and has the potential to cause worldwide pandemics every 10\u201340 years. to reduce the disease burden of influenza virus, south Korea has implemented the national immunization program (NIP) for influenza. the vaccination period was adjusted to October\u2013November in 2002 and September\u2013December in 2004. in 2017, free vaccine recipients were expanded to cover young children from 6 months to 5 years old. in 2003, pregnant women and people aged 50\u201364 years were included. in the 2005\u20132006 season, influenza vaccination was recommended for all pregnant women [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18]. all individuals aged 60 months to 18 years were included in the priority group for influenza vaccination in September 2017 [17]. influenza vaccination is not free of charge to all influenza NIP target groups. in 1997, the influenza vaccination was free of charge only to low-income elderly adults. in the 2016\u20132017 season, infants aged 6 months to 12 months were added to the free vaccination program. influenza vaccination rate among elderly adults aged 65 years increased from 73% to 80.9%. influenza vaccination rate increased in elderly adults aged 85 years by approximately 13%. the transition to private health sectors has been a fairly successful strategy. from 2004, the government initiated the management of internet-based monitoring of the vaccine supply status at public health units. the number of recipients of the influenza vaccine has more than tripled in 20 years, from 3,200,000 people in the 1997\u20131998 season to 9,890,000 in the 2016\u20132017 season. the vaccination rate for adults aged 65 years is continuously increasing because of expansion of services to private clinics. if an AE is reported after vaccination, the epidemiological study team performs a basic epidemiological investigation. the results are reported to the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program committee. since 2005, an average of 50 suspected AEs have been reported every year. the vaccine was given to approximately 15,000,000 people to increase group immunity in at-risk populations over a short period of time. the reports included 12 cases of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and 4 suspected cases of narcolepsy. the latter were found to be unrelated to the vaccine. the first case of H1N1 influenza was confirmed in the united states on April 26, 2009. by mid-August, the rate of reported cases of influenza-like illness was more than 2.67/1,000 persons. by early October, the number had reached their highest at 45.00/1,000 persons. from October 2009 to May 2010, approximately 14,750,000 doses of the H1N1 influenza vaccines were administered. from October 2009 to May 2010, approximately 14,750,000 doses of the H1N1 influenza vaccines were administered, which was 75.4% of the planned 18,890,000 doses. the vaccination period was changed to September\u2013November in 2002 and September\u2013December in 2004. the effects of a vaccination last up to 6 months on average. the vaccination period was adjusted to October\u2013December in 2005 and has remained so until now. all individuals aged 60 months to 18 years were included in the priority group for influenza vaccination in September 2017 [17]. in the 2017\u20132018 season, the NIP for influenza is recommended to people who are at a high risk for incidence of complications when infected with influenza virus. influenza vaccination is not free of charge to all influenza NIP target groups. in 1997, influenza vaccination was free of charge only to low-income elderly adults. in the 2016\u20132017 season, infants aged 6 months to 12 months were added to the free vaccination program. 65 years increased from 73% to 80.9%, compared to 2014\u20132015 season. influenza vaccination rate increased in elderly adults aged 85 years by approximately 13%. the transition to private health sectors has been a fairly successful strategy. the number of recipients of the influenza vaccine has more than tripled in 20 years, from 3,200,000 people in the 1997\u20131998 season to 9,890,000 in the 2016\u20132017 season. the vaccination rate for adults aged 65 years is continuously increasing because of expansion of services to private clinics. the vaccination injury study team conducts an investigation of the injury. the results are reported to the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program committee. since 2005, an average of 50 suspected AEs have been reported every year. influenza vaccination program started in 2007 at the city/district/county level. a structured online educational program has been operating since 2013, through the KCDC training system. the pandemic ended the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. by mid-August, the rate of reported cases of influenza-like illness was more than 2.67/1,000 persons. by early October, the number had reached their highest at 45.00/1,000 persons. the government devised an immunization plan to achieve a 39% vaccination rate. s were administered, which was 75.4% of the planned 18,890,000 doses. the number of influenza patients decreased steadily, and the H1N1 influenza epidemic ended with a total of 763,759 cases as of August 2010. a strategy should be formulated to improve the vaccination rate among the two high-risk groups."}
