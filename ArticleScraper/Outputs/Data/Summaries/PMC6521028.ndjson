{"summary": "PDCoV is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus with the genome length of approximately 25 kb. PDCoV could use the aminopeptidase N (APN) of mammalian and avian species to efficiently infect cells of an unusual abroad species range. melanoma differentiation associated gene 5 (MDA5) and DExH-box helicase 58 (DHX58/LGP2) (11) RIG-I and MDA5 were activators of interferon production post RNA virus infection or the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) analog polyinosine and polycytidilic acid (poly(I:C)) (12) RIG-I also resides in an autorepression state in normal physiological status cells type I IFNs are secreted and bind to the cell surface receptors of both virus-infected and non-infected neighbor cells to induce interferon-stimulating genes. however, viruses take on a variety of tactics to escape the host innate immune surveillance during the infection and replication. NS1 proteins from human but not swine or avian influenza virus strain were able to interact with human Riplet in a species-specific manner (22). PDCoV infection could suppress porcine RIG-I-mediated IFN- production in LLC-PK1 cells (30) PDCoV Nsp5 and NS6 were confirmed as the important regulatory viral proteins to inhibit the IFN- production. but the function of other viral proteins of PDCoV, especially the viral structure protein (S, E, M, N), has remained unclear. 1,640 medium (Gibco, USA) with 10% heat-inactivated FBS. recombinant VSV-GFP virus was generously provided by TRIZOL. cDNA of PK-15 cells or PDCoV-positive sample were used as templates. the full-length coding sequence (CDS) of PDCoV-N was constructed into the pcDNA3.1-HA or pcDNA3.1-Myc plasmid vector. the pGL3-pIFN--Luc and pNF-B-Luc plasmid were constructed according a previous study. poly(I:C) or VSV-GFP virus were transfected or infected for 16 h. the cells were then lysed, and the firefly luciferase and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using the dual-Luciferase reporter assay system. the cells were lysed on ice for 20 min in 600 l of lysis buffer. the cells were then immunoprecipitated at 4\u00b0C with mouse anti-FLAG or anti-HA affinity gel. the immunoprecipitants were then washed four times with the protein lyse buffer and then subjected to western blotting analysis. the antibody and DAPI used in the present study were purchased from Beyotime in China. fluorescent images were visualized and examined using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Fluoview ver. 3.1; Olympus, Japan) cell culture and Virus HEK293T cells (ATCC\u00aeCRL-3216TM) and PK-15 cells (ATCC\u00aeCCL-33TM) were obtained from the China Center for Type Culture Collection and maintained at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's Modified Ea-gle's medium (Gibco, USA) the porcine jejunum intestinal cells (IPEC-J2) were obtained from the China Center for Type Culture Collection. the full length or mutant coding sequence of porcine RLR signaling molecules was constructed into the pcDNA3.1-HA or pcDNA3.1-Myc plasmid vector. the full-length coding sequence of PDCoV-N was constructed into the pcDNA3.1-HA or pcDNA3.1-Myc plasmid. quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed using SYBR green Supermix (ABI-7500, Life, USA) the relative gene expression levels were calculated using the 2CT method. lysates were electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. the membranes were then analyzed by immunoblotting using mouse Flag, Myc, -actin, and rabbit HA antibodies. the cells were cotransfected with the recombination expression plasmid or an empty vector for 28 h. the cells were washed twice in PBS supplemented with 10 mM NEM and lysed with 1% SDS lysis buffer. at 24 h post transfection, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and then permeabilized with methyl alcohol for 10 min at room temperature. after three washes with TBST, the cells were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h. the mouse Flag-affinity gel was pretreated three times with 1 x TBS. then the cell lysates were added and incubated for 3 h at 4\u00b0C. the immunoprecipitants were boiled at 100\u00b0C for 10 min. PK-15 cells were transfected with PDCoV-N expression or empty vector plasmid for 24 h. PDCoV N protein suppressed porcine IFN- and ISGs expression. poly(I:C) could significantly suppress the VSV-GFP replication in infected host cells. pGL3-pIFN- or porcine NF-B-Luc (pGL3-pNF-B) plasmid with PDCoV N expression plasmid (pcDNA3.1-HA-PDCoV-N) at 18 h after transfection, cells were treated or untreated with VSV-GFP or Poly(I:C) (LMW) PK-15 cells were co-transfected with pGL3-pIFN-,pRL-TL, and pcDNA3.1-HA-PDCoV-N. PDCoV N protein inhibited porcine IFN- promoter activation by the porcine RLR signaling pathway. the function of PDCoV N was confirmed by the consistent results in the IPEC-J2 cells. pRIG-I and pTRAF3 were clearly coprecipitated with PDCoV N protein. the whole cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the anti-Flag affinity gel at 28 h post transfection. the PDCoV N protein and pRIG-I or pTRAF3 were co-localized in the cytoplasm in PK-15 cells. pRIG-I and pTRAF3 were the major targets of PDCoV N protein in the pRLR signaling pathway. HEK293T cells were co-transfected with PDCoV-N and flag-tagged pRIG-I (A\u2013C), pMDA5 (A), Flag-tagged TBK1 (B), Flag-tagged pMAVS (B), flag-tagged pTRAF3 (B,D) or flag-tagged pIRF3 (B) after 28 h of transfection, cells were lysed for co-IP assay with anti-Flag affinity PK-15 cells were cotransfected with pGL3-pIFN-, pRL-TL, and pcDNA3.1-Flag-pRIG-I alone or together with PDCoV N truncated fragments. pRIG-I and dose-increased PDCoV-N expression plasmid were cotransfected in HEK293T cells. PDCoV-N suppressed the porcine RIG-I-binding dsRNA. HEK293T cells were transfected with flag-tagged pRIG-I or HA-tagged PDCoV expression plasmid. the porcine RIG-I was purified by Flag affinity gel. the results showed that the polyubiquitination of pRIG-I was significantly increased. PDCoV N protein could decrease the pRIG-I K48R but not K63R-induced polyubiquitination. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with Flag-tagged pRIG-I and Myc-tagged PDCoV N or empty control plasmid with HA-Ub ubiquitin (HA-Ub) or empty control plasmid. after 28 h of transfection, the cells were lysed for Co-IP by Flag-affinity gel. pRiplet could significantly promote pRIG-I-induced pIFN--Luc activation. but pTRIM25 could not influence pRIG-I-induced pIFN--Luc activation. consistent results were observed in the IPEC-J2 cells. HEK293T cells were transfected with the HA-tagged pTRIM25 or HA-tagged pRiplet expression plasmid. after 28 h of transfected, the WCLs were detected with anti-HA antibody by western blot. PK-15 cells were co-transfected with pRIG-I, pGL3-pIFN-, and pRL-TK plasmid with pRiplet and Western blot was used to detect the immunoprecipitants and WCLs protein. TRIM25 and Riplet were also the targets of a virus to suppress the type I IFN signaling pathway (21, 25) the interactions between PDCoV N protein and pTRIM25 or pRiplet are explored in the present study. pRiplet bound to the HEL and RD domain but not the 2\u2032CARD domain. further analysis found that pRIG-I ubiquitination or K63-linked polyubiquitination was remarkably increased when the cells were co-transfected with pRiplet. PDCoV N protein expression could significantly decrease the pRIg-I ubiquitination and K63-linked polyubiquitination. HEK293T cells were co-transfected with pRIG-I and HA-Ub or HA-Ub-K63. after 28 h of transfection, the cells were lysed for Co-IP by Flag-affinity gel. Western blot was used to detect the immunoprecipitants and WCLs protein. pRiplet binding pRIG-I was significantly decreased in the coprecipitates. all above results proved that PDCoV N protein could interfere with pRiplet binding pRIG-I to inhibit the pRiplet-mediated pRIG-I K63-polyubiquitination. pIFN-, PK-15 cells were cotransfected empty vector, or PDCoV-N expression plasmid (pGL total RNA was extracted from cells to detect expression level of porcine IFN- and several interferon-induced genes (ISGs) the results indicated that PDCoV N protein suppressed porcine IFN- production. poly(I:C) could significantly suppress the VSV-GFP replication in infected host cells. PK-15 cells cultured in 12-well plates were transfected with pcDNA3.1-HA-PDCoV-N or empty plasmid for 24 h. after 16 h post transfection, the cells were lysed by TRZOL to extract the total RNA. PDCoV N protein was an antagonist of porcine IFN- production. PK-15 cells were co-transfected with pGL3-pIFN-,pRL-TL, and pRL-TK. PDCoV N protein inhibited porcine IFN- promoter activation by the porcine RLR signaling pathway. Western blot was used to detect the protein expression of PDCoV N. the -actin was as the loading control protein. all the experiments were independently performed three times. pRIG-I and pTRAF3 were the major targets of PDCoV N protein in the pRLR signaling pathway. the activation of RIG-I was a prerequisite of IFN- production by RLR signaling pathway. however, pRIG-I could significantly block the pIFN- promoter activation. PK-15 cells were cotransfected with PDCoV-N and flag-tagged pRIG-I. after 28 h of transfection, cells were lysed for co-IP assay with anti-Flag gel. PDCoV NS6 inhibited IFN- production by suppressing the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding human RIG-I and MDA5 in HEK293T cells. it is unclear whether PDCoV N could compete with porcine RIG-I to bind dsRNA. PDCoV-N suppressed the porcine RIG-I-binding dsRNA. cells were lysed for Co-IP by poly(I:C) or poly(C)(pC)-beads. western blot was used to detect the protein. PDCoV N protein could decrease the pRIG-I K48R but not K63R-induced polyubiquitination. results showed that PDCoV N protein could suppress the pRIG-I K63-linked polyubiquitination, especially the K63-linked polyubiquitination. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with pRIG-I and Myc-tagged pRIG-I. cells were lysed for Co-IP by Flag-affinity gel. Western blot was used to detect the immunoprecipitants and WCLs protein. pTRIM25 could not influence pRIG-I-induced pIFN--Luc activation. consistent results were observed in the IPEC-J2 cells. pRiplet was the more important protein in activating pRIG-I. PK-15 cells were co-transfected with pRIG-I, pGL3-pIFN-, and pRL-TK plasmid with pRiplet and Myc-PDCoV-N, the empty plasmid as the control. dual-luciferase assays were performed at 24 h post transfection. PDCoV N protein and pTRIM25 or pRiplet expression plasmid were co-transfected in HEK293T cells for co-IP analysis. results showed that pRiplet could directly interact with pRIG-I. pRiplet bound to the HEL and RD domain but not the 2\u2032CARD domain. pRIG-I ubiquitination or K63-linked polyubiquitination was increased. PDCoV N protein expression could significantly decrease pRiplet-induced pRIG-I K63-polyubiquitination. after 28 h of transfection, cells were lysed for Co-IP by Flag-affinity gel. HEK293T cells were co-transfected with pRiplet and pRIG-I. after 28 h of transfection, the cells were lysed for Co-IP by Flag-affinity gel. Western blot was used to detect the immunoprecipitants and WCLs protein. PDCoV non-structure protein 5 encoded a 3C-like protease to interrupt the IFN- signaling pathway. PDCoV Nsp5 also could cleavage the signal transducer and activator of human transcription 2 (STAT2) to antagonize IFN- signaling in HEK293T cells. the protein activator of protein kinase R (PACT) is a cellular dsRNA-binding protein potentiating IFN production by binding to RIG-I and MDA5 (39, 40) the mouse hepatitis virus and SARS-CoV N protein could interact with PACT to suppress the dsRNA translocated to RIG-I and MDA5 (36). PDCoV N protein could directly interact with porcine RIG-I. RD domain was important for PDCoV N protein interacting with porcine RIG-I. this may explain why PDCoV N protein specifically binds to porcine MDA5. the mechanism of PDCoV N protein interfered with the type I IFN response. PDCoV infects the host cells by attaching to the celluar receptor porcine APN. in the cytoplasm, PDCoV release the viral genomic RNA and then complete the transcription and replication process. PDCoV N protein may have another function to regulate the porcine RIG-I activation or suppress the downstream signaling transduction. TRAFs mediates its oligomerization and the association with downstream effector protein. the west Nile virus NS1 also antagonizes IFN- production by inhibiting RIG-I and MDA5 K63-linked polyubiquitination (22). the PDCoV N protein directly interacts with human TRIM25 to suppress the RIG-I K63-linked polyubiquitination (25). however, pTRIM25 could not promote the activation of pRIG-I induced IFN- promoter (Figure 6C) PDCoV N protein blocked the pRIG-I K63-linked polyubiquitination by interfering pRiplet binding to pRIG-I. pRiplet mainly binds to the HEL domain of pRIG-I, while PDCoV N protein mainly binds to the CTD of pRIG-I. the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
