{"summary": "we aimed to investigate the relationship between influenza infection and IPD in Ontario, Canada. we evaluated a total number of 38,501 positive influenza tests in central Ontario and 6,191 episodes of IPD in the Toronto/Peel area, Ontario, Canada, between 1 January 1995 and 3 October 2009. peaks occur because of a complex interplay of factors such as the loss of immunity to the pathogen over time and seasonal changes in the pathogen's ability to infect new individuals. in temperate countries in the northern hemisphere, illness caused by influenza viruses usually peaks between December and March, perhaps because weather conditions favor the survival of influenza virus in the environment. researchers used a mathematical method called fast Fourier transforms to look for any relationship between infections with the two pathogens over yearly timescales. they found wintertime peaks for infections with both pathogens, but there was no correlation between the seasonal wave forms for influenza and with IPD. the findings have important implications for disease control policy. the extension of influenza vaccination to school-age children and young adults could reduce the incidence of IPD as well as the incidence of influenza. a related research article by the same authors evaluating links between respiratory viruses and invasive meningococcal disease can be found in PLoS One. a complex system cannot be adequately characterized by evaluating cross-sectional correlation in risk, particularly when causal links are concerned. we aimed to investigate the relationship between influenza infection and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in canada. all invasive pneumococcal infections identified in residents of Toronto/Peel from 1 January 1995 through 3 October 2009 were included in the analysis. invasive pneumococcal infection was defined as illness in which S. pneumoniae was isolated from a normally sterile body site. the phase-shift of the composite waveform generated by combining sine and cosine components can be approximated as tan1(1/2) and can be used to estimate the timing of peak disease incidence. standard errors for phase-shift and amplitude were estimated as sums of standard errors for each model coefficient minus covariance. model construction evaluating the impact of influenza A and B (combined), influenza A, or influenza B on IPD risk was performed by including viral infection incidence and environmental exposures considered a priori to be likely to influence pneumococcal disease epidemiology. virological and environmental exposures included UV index, temperature, and relative humidity. a causal exposure to an independent variable should be associated with a lagged change in the dependent variable. a causal exposure to an independent variable should be associated with a lagged change in the dependent variable. this relationship should be absent when the temporal sequence of exposure and response is reversed. the design is characterized by \u201cself matching\u201d in that cases serve as their own controls. es of 0.05 were considered statistically significant. the study was approved by research ethics boards at all participating institutions. all 25 hospitals, 19 laboratories and 85 long-term care facilities participate in this network. arithmetic means of environmental data were used as exposure variables. seasonality of disease occurrence was evaluated by autocorrelations for weekly case counts [2],[11]. negative binomial regression models incorporated population data derived from the 2001 and 2006 censes as offsets. virological and environmental exposures were considered at lags of up to 4 wk prior to pneumococcal case occurrence. the 2004 and 2009 influenza seasons were outliers with respect to timing and amplitude. time series methods Granger causality Wald testing was used to determine whether influenza A and B (combined), influenza A, and influenza B seasons can be used to forecast peaks in pneumococcal infections. starting on January 1, 1995, the person-time at risk was divided into 3-wk time strata. control periods were chosen by matching the hazard period by day of the week within the stratum. control periods could precede, both follow, or straddle the hazard period [23],[24]. we evaluated the correlation between phase and amplitude terms for influenza A and B (combined), influenza A, and influenza B and pneumococcal sine waves, by year, by calculating Spearman correlation coefficients. differences in the magnitude of heterogeneity of amplitude or phase by pathogen was assessed using cochran's Q test. a case-crossover approach was used to evaluate short-term associations between influenza A and B (combined), influenza A, and IPD occurrence during influenza seasons. a causal exposure to an independent variable should be associated with a lagged change in the dependent variable, and this relationship should be absent when the temporal sequence of exposure and response is reversed. the design is characterized by \u201cself matching\u201d in that cases serve as their own controls. a \u201ccase\u201d thereby is a day on which a case occurred, whereas a \u201ccontrol\u201d is an adequately selected day on which a case did not occur [21],[22]. maximum autocorrelation coefficient (ac) = 0.4488 at week 52. peak incidence could be observed in week 6 (mid-February) periodicity of influenza infections was less regular; maximum ac could be identified at 59-week lags for influenza A and B. differences in heterogeneity 2 statistics between pathogens [12] were highly significant for both amplitude and phase terms (p0.001). Heterogeneity of phase and amplitude terms of influenza A and influenza B was in line with influenza A and B (combined), influenza A, or influenza B could be detected using Spearman correlation (Tables 1\u20133) Phase or Amplitude Phase Influenza B Amplitude S. pneumoniae Phase S. pneumoniae Amplitude influenza B 0.38 (0.15) 0.07 (0.80) 0.06 (0.84) Phase influenza B \u2014 0.29 (0.28) 0.06 (0.81) Amplitude S. pneumoniae \u2014 0.49 (0.05) Data are presented as Spearman correlation coefficient (p-value) Influenza A and B (combined, per 100 infections), 1-wk lag 1.092 1.047\u20131.138 0.001 Influenza A and B (combined, per 100 infections), 3-wk lag 0.932 0.890\u20130.976 0.003 UVI average, 1-wk lag 0.927 0.893\u20130.963 0.001 UVI average, 3-wk lag 0.946 0.917\u20130.976 0.001 Relative humidity, 1-wk lag (wk) Odds Ratio 95% Confidence Interval p-Value 0 1.05 0.97\u20131.13 0.20 1 1.10 1.02\u20131.18 0.01 2 1.00 0.93\u20131.09 0.90 3 0.93 0.86\u20131.01 0.07 4 1.02 0.94\u20131.11 0.65 Data are presented as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals for 1 IPD case per 100 influenza cases. meta-analyses revealed substantial heterogeneity of phase (Cochran Q statistic: 2 = 62810.15, df = 15, p0.001; I 2 = 99.7%) terms for influenza A and B (combined), there was less heterogeneity of amplitude (Cochran Q statistic: 2 = 40.06, df = 15, p0.001; I 2 = 62.6%) terms for influenza A and B (combined) Phase or Amplitude Phase Influenza A Amplitude S. pneumoniae Phase S. pneumoniae Amplitude influenza A 0.19 (0.48) 0.06 (0.83) 0.20 (0.05) Phase influenza A \u2014 0.11 (0.70) 0.12 (0.65) Amplitude S. pneumoniae \u2014 0.49 (0.05) Data are presented as Spearman correlation coefficient (p-value) we identified no significant interactions between influenza counts, UV index, and humidity. there was no significant association between influenza B incidence and IPD risk in either univariable or multivariable models. there was no significant association between total influenza (A and B) and IPD with a 1-wk lag. there was no significant association between IPD risk and daily changes in clear-sky UV index, temperature, or relative humidity. there was no significant association between influenza B incidence and IPD risk in either univariable or multivariable models. the results could be reproduced for influenza A (p0.001) and influenza B (p = 0.017). mococcal disease could not be shown to Granger-cause influenza A and B (combined) infection (Chi-square = 4.39, df = 2, p = 0.11) case-crossover results We were able to identify a significant association between total influenza (A and B) and IPD with a 1-wk lag using a case-crossover approach. pneumococcal seasonal waves would \u201ctrack\u201d influenza waves. the seasonal \u201cwaves\u201d of influenza and IPD were independent of one another. the nonstereotyped nature of wintertime seasonality of viral pathogens has been noted previously. IPD causes morbidity in those in age groups not included in traditional influenza immunization programs. a previous study identified diminished ambient UV radiation as a significant predictor of increased IPD risk, an effect that could either be due to effects of UV radiation on 1,25-(OH)2-vitamin-D metabolism. our use of case-crossover design implicitly matches for all seasonal effects that would be constant over the 3-wk time block used for each risk stratum. the case-crossover approach assumes that the distribution of exposure is constant across referent times, which should be controlled by careful referent selection. nondifferential misclassification of exposures would mean that the effects reported here are likely to be lower-bound effects, with true effects being larger. strong degree of agreement in our findings suggests they are robust and not artifacts of the analytic approach taken."}
