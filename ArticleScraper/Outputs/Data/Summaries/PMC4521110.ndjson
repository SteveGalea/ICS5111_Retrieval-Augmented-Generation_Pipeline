{"summary": "the association of respiratory viruses in children with Kawasaki disease (KD) was investigated using multiplex reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and tissue Doppler echocardiography. infectious, immunologic, and genetic factors seem to contribute to the occurrence of KD. some infectious agents may trigger an abnormal immune response in children who are genetically susceptible to the disease, leading to acquiring KD. 138 KD patients (80 males, 58 females) were treated with a single dose of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG, 2 g/kg for 10-12 hours) and high dose aspirin (30 mg/kg three times per day) until having an afebrile status for more than 2 days, after which low dose aspirin (5 mg/kg/day) was administered. alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), serum total protein, albumin, C-reactive protein (CRP), N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) echocardiography was performed using an IE33 machine with an S8 transducer on KD patients and febrile patients. ystolic myocardial velocity (S'), early diastolic myocardial velocity (E'), and late diastolic myocardial velocity (A') were obtained. TDI combines systolic and diastolic LV time intervals using the formula (a-b)/b. nasopharyngeal secretion of KD patients using nasal and throat swabs on first day of hospitalization. RT-PCR was performed using AdvanSureTM RV real-time PCR. the Kruskal wallis test and the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test were used to compare laboratory data between KD patients and the control group. a p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. completed blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), serum total protein, albumin, C-reactive protein (CRP), natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) echocardiography was performed using an IE33 machine (Philips Medical System, Andover, MA, USA) the peak systolic myocardial velocity (S'), early diastolic myocardial velocity (E') and late diastolic myocardial velocity (A') were obtained. a narrow sector angle was used, and image depth was adjusted to allow for a high frame rate. a giant aneurysm was defined as an internal lumen diameter of greater than 8 mm. a giant aneurysm was defined as an internal lumen diameter of greater than 8 mm. a giant aneurysm was defined as an internal lumen diameter of greater than 8 mm. data were expressed as meanstandard deviation. echocardiographic findings were represented as adjusted meanstandard deviation after adjustment for covarients such as CRP and fever duration. the rate of incomplete type KD was significantly higher in group 1 than in group 1. other features, such as polymorphous skin rash, lip and oral mucosal abnormalities, hand or foot erythema, and edema, were more frequently observed in group 1. ALT was significantly higher (56.784.2 IU/L vs. 93.2133.7 IU/L) in group 2 compared with group 1. other laboratory tests including those for Hb, WBC, SEG %, ESR, AST, and total protein showed no significant differences. 305.882.7 301.353.4 239.474.9 ESR (mm/hr) 36.624.5 35.624.2 22.816.3 CRP (mg/dL) 7.28.7 5.94.4 3.02.8 AST (IU/L) 56.685.6 114.9264.5 37.815.8 ALT (IU/L) 56.784.2 93.2133.7* 25.743.8 Total protein (g/dL) the control group had a significantly higher positive rate for viral PCR for parainfluenza virus 3 (0% vs. 24.0%, p=0.001) there were no significant differences in positive rates of respiratory virus PCR. the control group had a significantly higher positive rate for viral PCR for parainfluenza virus 3 (0% vs. 24.0%, p=0.001) group 1 (n=94) group 2 (n=44) p EF (%) 72.07.3 67.218.0 0.078 FS (%) 39.92.2 11.66.1 0.052 A' 5.62.7 6.22.6 0.320 S' 5.61.2 6.21.4 0.320 Tei index (ms) 0.340.07 0.440.06* 0.048 IVCT 49.515.9 61.48.9* 0.010 IVRT 41.011.7 46.012.6 0.114 coroner artery abnormality was more frequent in group 2 compared with group 1. if KD patients showed fever (higher than 38\u00b0C) after 36 hours of IVIG infusion, they were regarded as non-responders. there were no significant differences in the number of IVIG responders, family history, recurrence, and retreated cases of KD between group 1 and group 2. 44 patients (31.8%) were included in the KD group without respiratory symptoms (group 2). there were no significant differences in age and sex between group 1 and group 2. conjunctival injection was found in 80.9% of the patients, cervical lymphadenopathy over 1.5 cm in 33.0%, skin rash in 71.3%, lip and/or oral mucosal abnormality in 75.5%, palm and/or sole erythema and edema in 22.7%, and junctival injection, n (%) 76 (80.9) 32 (72.7) 0.376 Cervical lymphadenopathy, n (%) 31 (33.0) 8 (18.2) 0.104 Polymorphous skin rash, n (%) 67 (71.3) 23 (52.3) 0.036 Abnormalities of lip or oral mucosa, n (%) 71 (75.5) 14 (31.8)* 0.001 Abnormalities of extremities, n (%) 59 (6 74.9109/L), CRP (5.94.4 mg/dL vs. 3.02.8 mg/dL), and ALT (93.2133.7 IU/L vs. 25.743.8 IU/L) were significantly higher in group 2 than in group 3. other laboratory tests including those for Hb, WBC, SEG %, ESR, AST, and total protein showed no significant differences between group 2 and group 3. p0.05, significantly different from group 1 (group 1 vs. group 2). p0.05, significantly different from group 3 (group 2 vs. group 3). no significant differences in positive rates of PCR between group 2 and group 3. 0.001 Influenza A and B 0 2 (4.0) 1.000 Respiratory syncytial virus B 3 (6.8) 1 (2.0) 0.182 Rhinovirus A, B and C 1 (2.2) 10 (20.0) 0.159 Metapneumo virus 0 5 (10.0) 0.058 Adenovirus 22 (54.5)* 15 (30.0) 0.027 Bocavirus 1 (2.2) 3 (6.0) 1.000 Data aren (%). ppler imaging (cm/s) E' 9.92.2 11.66.1 0.052 A' 5.62.7 6.22.6 0.320 S' 5.61.2 6.21.4 0.320 Tei index (ms) 0.340.07 0.440.06* 0.048 IVCT 49.515.9 61.48.9* 0.010 IVRT 41.011.7 46.012.6 0.114 LVET 236.478.9 210.480.2 0.183 Coronary artery diameter (mm) was there were no significant differences in the number of IVIG responders, family history, recurrence, and retreated cases of KD between group 1 and group 2. there were no significant differences in the number of IVIG responders, family history, recurrence, and retreated cases of KD between group 1 and group 2. adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, and bocavirus were found in KD patients. the control group had a significantly higher positive rate for parainfluenza virus 3 (0% vs. 24.0%, p=0.001). there was no significant association between respiratory viruses and KD. NT-pro BNP had the highest diagnostic value for KD among other factors. 2.4% of KD patients had adenovirus in their respiratory tract. 5 of 6 KD patients with concomitant adenovirus infection had incomplete KD. virus PCR shows higher sensitivity and detects a relatively low level of virus. nasopharyngeal swab samples from all KD patients with respiratory symptoms were excluded. group 1 patients were assumed not to have concomitant viral infections. RT-PCR results for all KD patients would help identify relationship between respiratory viruses with echocardiographic findings in KD patients."}
