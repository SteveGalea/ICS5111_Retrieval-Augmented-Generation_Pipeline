{"summary": "there are currently no evidence-based diagnostic rules to identify microbial aetiology in children presenting with acute cough. there are currently no evidence-based diagnostic rules to identify microbial aetiology in primary care. no diagnostic or prognostic rule has been developed to distinguish bacterial from viral RTI that would be expected to respond to antibiotics. this leads to diagnostic uncertainty, which is reflected in a wide variation in antibiotic prescribing rates between clinicians,5 practices,6 and countries. study selection Studies eligible for inclusion were all peer-reviewed, quantitative studies reporting microbiological and clinical data from children presenting to a healthcare service or research team with a diagnosis or symptoms of an RTI associated with cough. studies recruited from primary care, secondary care, and community settings were excluded. study participants recruited from a population of children with a high prevalence of pre-existing chronic disease or immune incompetence. titles and abstracts of all articles identified were reviewed by one author, with good agreement ( 0.89) full-text copies of all included articles were independently reviewed by one of two authors. terogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic. included studies were required to present data at the level of individual patients. MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane database were searched on 30 November 2012. systematic review reports an absence of evidence for the relationship between clinical characteristics and microbiology in children with RTI. only 13% of potential relationships between clinical characteristics and microbiology have been investigated, with 25% reporting significant associations. further research is urgently needed to establish the value of symptoms and signs for making a microbiological diagnosis. participants recruited from a population of children with a high prevalence of pre-existing chronic disease or immune incompetence. titles and abstracts of all articles identified were reviewed by one author, with good agreement ( 0.89). full-text copies of all included articles were independently reviewed by one of two other authors, with good agreement ( 0.89). study characteristics Searches identified 9984 articles of which 2502 were duplicates and 6378 excluded on basis of title. half of studies recruited only infants aged 0\u20131 years, 1 out of 28 (4%) recruited only children aged from 2\u201317 years, and 3 out of 28 recruited infants and children aged from 0\u201317 years. culture (4 out of 28 studies, 14%), assays (real-time analyte specific reagent or enzyme-linked immunoassay) (4 out of 28, 14%), and direct immunofluorescence (5 out of 28, 18%) were set in high-income countries. inpatients Observational prospective 18 years NPA Any RTI PCR NR RSV, hMPV, CV, IA, IB, PIV Univariable Ghafoor 199032 1492 Pakistan Secondary care: inpatients and outpatients Observational prospective 18 years NPA Any RTI Immunofluorescence or culture NR RSV, PIV, IA, IB, AdV Univariable Harnden 200733 425 UK Primary care Observational prospective Observational prospective 18 years NPA Any RTI PCR Yes RSV, IA, IB, PIV, hMPV Multivariable Nuolivirta 201040 142 Finland Secondary care: inpatients Observational retrospective 1 year NPA Bronchiolitis Immunofluorescence or PCR NR RSV, IA, IBAdV, PIV, hMPV, hBOV Univariable Papadopoulous 200241 118 Greece inpatient nchiolitis Real-time PCR NR RSV, hMPV Univariable von Linstow 200447 383 Denmark Secondary care: inpatients Retrospective case-control 18 years NPA Any RTI PCR NR IA, IB,PIV, AdV, EV, MP, CP Multivariable Xepapadaki 200413 56 Greece Secondary care: inpatients Observational prospective 1 year NPW Bronchitis PCR NR pathogens were identified for 71 symptoms and signs, yielding 1704 potential comparisons. of the potential comparisons 226 (13%) were investigated by one or more study. 19% showed statistically significant associations; 58% showed no significant association; and 23% presented no relevant statistical analysis. study characteristics Searches identified 9984 articles of which 2502 were duplicates. there were 1104 abstracts screened and the full texts of 216 articles were read. twenty-eight articles were eligible for inclusion in the review. inpatients Observational prospective 1 year NPA Any RTI PCR NR BP Univariable Akhras 201026 256 US Secondary care: inpatients Observational prospective 1 year NPA Any RTI Culture NR AdV Univariable Berman 199027 90 US Secondary care: outpatients Observational prospective 1 year NPA Any RTI Immunofluorescence or culture NR RSV, CP, BP, PIV, RV NR Chen 201028 878 inpatients Observational prospective 18 years NPA Any RTI PCR NR IA, IB, RSV, hMPV, PIV, AdV Multivariable Heininger 199334 3629 Germany Primary care Observational prospective 18 years NPA Any RTI PCR NR BP Univariable IJpma 200435 137 South Africa Secondary care: inpatients Observational prospective 18 years NPA Any RTI Assay or culture NR RSV, RV Univariable care Observational prospective 1 year NPA Any RTI PCR NR RSV, CV, IA, IB, PIV, AdV, CP Multivariable Pierangeli 200842 455 Brazil Secondary care: inpatients Observational prospective 1 year NPA Any RTI Immunofluorescence NR RSV, AdV, IA, IV, PIV Univariable Pierangeli 201243 231 Italy Emergency department Observational prospective 18 years Pharyngeal CP Multivariable Xepapadaki 200413 56 Greece Secondary care: inpatients Observational prospective 1 year NPW Bronchitis PCR NR hMPV and RSV Univariable AdV = adenovirus.

IV = influenza all six associations described the relationships between respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and clinical signs. rales were not significantly associated with RSV (OR 1.2, 95% CI = 0.98 to 1.4, I2 = 0%, P0.669), nor was fever (OR 0.97, 95% CI = 0.7 to 1.3, I2 = 0%, P = 0.507) the results are applicable to children presenting to primary or secondary care with cough. but caution should be taken in applying them beyond this population due to the effect of age on both URT flora and symptomatic presentation. the use of URT samples as the diagnostic reference standard may represent a poor measure of aetiology. clinical features are moderately diagnostic for the detection of streptococci from the throat in patients presenting to primary care with tonsillitis. this review demonstrates a significant gap in the evidence for using clinical presentation to make a microbiological diagnosis for children presenting with RTI. this suggests that clinical presentation could be associated with the detection of other easily accessible URT microbes. this could be used to develop future diagnostic strategies and improve targeting of antimicrobials. a lack of consensus was identified regarding the definition of continuous objective signs such as \u2018hypoxia\u2019 and \u2018fever\u2019. some studies defined \u2018hypoxaemia\u2019 as a blood oxygen saturation level of 92%,13\u201315 while in others the cutoff limits were 95%. clinicians should be cautious about using clinical features to distinguish the \u2018bacterial\u2019 or \u2018viral\u2019 status of RTI in children in primary care. high-quality observational studies investigating a broad panel of respiratory pathogens are lacking, particularly in the primary care setting. group Ltd, grants from Nanosphere Inc. and travel expenses from Nanosphere Inc. to attend and present data on above point-of-care test evaluation. all other authors declare no competing interests."}
