{"summary": "virus-cell entry requires glycoprotein-catalyzed fusion of viral and host cell membranes. the triggering factors include host cell receptors, endosomal acids, and proteases. many viruses require a single, soluble trigger, for example, influenza A virus fusion proteins are triggered by protons. transmembrane protease serine type 2 (TMPRSS2) can cleave coV fusion glycoproteins into unlocked, fusion-catalyzing forms [8, 9, 11] at the cell surface and facilitate a rapid, \u201cearly\u201d entry. studies examining HIV [12] and influenza [13] glycoproteins indicate that multiple adjacent fusion glycoproteins must be activated. fusion likely occurs in regions of the cell membrane with a relatively high local concentration of these no study has determined the relative importance of individual tetraspanins and TTSPs to MERS-CoV infection in the lung environment. there are 34 human tetraspanins and at least 17 members of the TTSP protease family [24] as well as several soluble extracellular proteases, such as elastases [25] that may be expressed in the lung parenchyma. a coV-cell entry portal is a multipartite complex that minimally includes the virus receptor, a virus-activating protease, and one or more tetraspanins. these complexes are responsible for the majority of MERS-CoV entry in lung cells. however, CD9 provided no support to cell culture-derived, avirulent spike-mediated cell entry. CD81 levels were highest in CD9KO cells. lower-resolution immunofluorescent assays showed similar cell-surface CD9 in WT and CD81KO cells. tetraspanin CD63 distribution remained unchanged in all cell lines. CD9 complementation restored susceptibility to MERSpp and 229Epp transductions. CD9 complementation restored susceptibility to all four of the CoVpps. tetraspanin, CD9, was necessary to fully sensitize cells to MERSpps. tetraspanin-enriched membrane fractions were surface-biotinylated. tetraspanins were liberated from cells using zwitterionic CHAPS detergent. LD fractions from CHAPS-solubilized cells contained 60% of cell-surface tetraspanins. CD9 repositioned DPP4 and APN into tetraspanin-enriched membranes. the fact that CD9 promoted the entry of DPP4- and APN-utilizing MERS and 229E viruses, but not ACE2- or CEACAM-utilizing SARS and MHV viruses. KO cells were also complemented with the appropriate tetraspanin. ide probes are applied to cells, and their close spacing (40 nm) allows for probe hybridization into DNA polymerization templates, which provide a locus point for fluorescent DNA synthesis. PLAs have been used to identify interactions between tetraspanins and their partner proteins. CD9 sensitizes cells to MERSpp entry by bringing DPP4 and TMPRSS2 into proximity. hDPP4 and TMPRSS2 were forcibly overexpressed; with overexpression, 30 foci/cell were observed. this increased to 80 foci/cell in the presence of CD9. the average number of foci/cell in each group was quantified. the average number of foci/cell in each group was quantified. we hypothesized that CD9 facilitates TTSP-mediated early cell entry. MERSpp entry was measured by luciferase assay. without CD9, the MERSpp entry route may be directed to a late, endosomal stage in which cathepsins provide fusion-activating triggers. rAd5 vectors were transduced into mouse Lung Epithelial Type 1 cells. the cells were analyzed for the presence of hDPP4, TMPRSS2 and CD9 by western blot. the cells were analyzed for the presence of hDPP4 and TMPRSS2. LET-1 cells were transduced with the indicated Ad5 vector before transducing with VSV-MERSpp. cells were inoculated with recombinant VSVs encoding firefly luciferase [40] and pseudotyped with MERS-CoV S proteins. TMPRSS2 co-expression from the Ad5 vectors increased susceptibility to MERSpps by 4-fold, while shTmprss2 and shCd9 both restricted CD9 and TMPRSS2 are responsible for 90% of MERS-CoV titers in vivo. virulent MERS viruses use CD9-dependent early entry MERS-CoV. LET-1 cells were transduced with rAd5-hDPP4-Empty (black bars) or rAd5-hDPP4-shCd9 (dashed bars) before transduction with VSV-pps carrying the indicated MERS S proteins. LET-1 cells previously transduced with rAd5-hDPP4-empty (solid lines) or rAd5-hDPP4-shCd CD9-facilitated entry correlated with TTSP utilization. TTSP utilization correlates with rapid coV entry into cells. we hypothesized that CD9 is a determining factor in coV-cell entry kinetics. 293T and HeLa cells were transfected with Cas9/guide RNAs targeting CD9 or CD81, selected for puromycin resistance, and cloned by endpoint dilution. the only observable distinction was with the CD9KO cells, which adhered less tightly to plastic than WT or CD81KO cells. 9KO cells were transfected with appropriate receptors and CD9 where indicated. CD9 promotes virus entry directed by MERS-CoV and 229E-CoV S proteins. tetraspanins CD9 or CD81 operate in coV entry. TMPRSS2 obviated the CD9 requirement indicated a role for CD9 in proteolytic activation of coV entry. CD9 directs selected coV receptors into tetraspanin-associated membrane microdomains. a single tetraspanin family member, CD9, promoted cell entry for some, but not all coVs. LD fractions from WT control cells contained 60% of cell-surface DPP4. LD fractions from CD9 KO cells completely lacked DPP4. similar results were observed with 229E receptor APN. cells were isolated by streptavidin pulldown and analyzed in high density (HD) and low density (LD) fractions. CD9 facilitates close proximity of DPP4 and TMPRSS2 at the cell surface. we performed PLAs on unpermeabilized CD9KO HeLa cells using primary antibodies to CD9, DPP4 and/or TMPRSS2. fluorescent foci were rarely observed on the HeLa-CD9KO cells. the cells were only modestly susceptible to MERSpp transduction. CD9 helped to connect overexpressed DPP4 and TMPRSS2 together. but in this overexpression condition, CD9 did not increase MERSpp transduction. this may be because other tetraspanins come in to bridge abundant receptors and proteases. tetraspanin KO cells were transfected with DPP4 and a complementing tetraspanin. the cells were pretreated with camostat before transduction with MERSpps. adenovirus vectors identify MERS-CoV entry factors in mice We advanced to evaluating MERS-CoV entry factors in vivo. the importance of specific TTSPs, or for tetraspanins, is unknown for any in vivo CoV infection. we developed dual-expressing rAd5 vectors expressing both human DPP4 and shRNAs that knock down Tmprss2 or Cd9 mRNAs. LET-1 cells transduced with rAd5-hDPP4-shTmprss2 had only 25% of the transcripts of cells transduced with rAd5-hDPP4-shTmprss2. this level indicated an efficient knockdown of TMPRSS2 in the approximately 75% of cells that were successfully transduced. 5-transduced LET-1 cells were susceptible to MERS-CoV S protein-directed virus entry. hDPP4 expression established susceptibility to VSV-MERSpp transduction. TMPRSS2 co-expression from the Ad5 vectors increased susceptibility to MERSpps by 4-fold. shTmprss2 and shCd9 both restricted MERSpps by 3 fold. CD9 and TMPRSS2 are responsible for 90% of MERS-CoV titers in vivo. virulent MERS viruses utilize CD9-dependent early entry MERS-CoV. this adaptation process was initiated by intranasally infecting mice with avirulent, vero cell culture-adapted (CCA) MERS-CoVs. LET-1 cells were transduced with rAd5-hDPP4-Empty (black bars) or rAd5-hDPP4-shCd9 (dashed bars) before transduction with VSV-pps carrying the indicated MERS S proteins. the entry kinetics of LET-1 cells was measured in LET-1 cells previously transduced with rAd5-hDPP4-Empty (solid lines) a 30\u201345 min half time for virus entry is found for several viruses requiring endocytosis prior to genome delivery. the MA1 and MA2 pps reached 50% entry in CD9-replete cells in 20 and 19 minutes, but were delayed to 34 and 30 minutes, respectively, in CD9KD cells. this was discovered through creative use of recombinant adenoviruses. a transducing rAd5 expressing the MERS-CoV receptor hDPP4 sensitized laboratory mice to MERS-CoV infection [26] by incorporating RNA silencing genes into rAd5-hDPP4. the dual-expressing rAd5 vectors revealed CD9 and TMPRSS2 as relevant proviral factors, operating to support the primary hDPP4 susceptibility factor. TMPRSS2 abuts against hDPP4 to access S proteins. proteolytic cleavage sites would be displayed at the outer edges of each S trimer. tetraspanin-enriched environment likely permits rapid and simultaneous cleavage of several adjacent S proteins. inefficient late entry may also be explained by differences in lysosomal and plasma membranes. late entry is restricted by interferon-induced gene products, notably interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) proteins [67, 68], but early TTSP-facilitated entry is not. in the MERS-CoV S protein cryo-EM structure, this residue 1015 is part of a peptide that connects two of the helices comprising the fusion domain. change from N1015 to T may ease restrictions to conformational change in the S trimer, thereby exposing cleavage sites to the nearby CD9-associated transmembrane protease. findings may shed light on general roles for tetraspanins in virology tetraspanins facilitate viral entry (CoVs, IAVs, HCV, HPVs) syncytia formation (CDV, HIV, FIV, HTLV-1), or promote viral exit (IAVs, HSV-1 and HIV), by unclear mechanisms. tetraspanins CD151 and CD63 do not directly interact with HPVs, but rather hold several co-receptors together.
