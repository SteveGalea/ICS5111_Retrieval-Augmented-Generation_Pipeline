{"summary": "Background bovine rotavirus (BRV) is a non-enveloped dsRNA virus that causes neonatal calf diarrhea. the virus is a major agent of neonatal calf diarrhea that causes severe diarrhoea, dehydration, anorexia and death in newborn calves. strains are specialized membrane microdomains that are enriched in sphingolipids, cholesterol, SRC family protein kinases, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins. cholesterol-enrich membrane mircodomains play an important role in multiple stages of virus life cycle. intact cell membrane cholesterol was dispensable for the virus replication. however, virus assembly was in a cholesterol-dependent pathway. results suggest that cellular cholesterol is required for BRV attachment. cells were mock treated or treated with indicated concentrations of MCD for 30 min. at 1 h later, cell lysates were prepared by freeze-thaw. virus titers and viral mRNA levels were decreased in a dose-dependent manner. all experiments were performed three times, and the error bars indicated the standard deviation of three independent experiments. after virus attachment, the unbound BRV was removed, cells were treated with MCD at indicated time at 37\u00b0C. the inhibitive effect was partially reversed by cholesterol replenishment. compared to untreated cells, viral mRNA levels and protein amounts were not reduced. but virus titers were significantly decreased. BRV replication on MA-104 cells is independent of cell cholesterol. no inhibitory effect was detected by virus titration assay. it indicated cholesterol depletion had no effect on BRV attachment. cell viability after treatment with various concentrations of MCD for 30 min was determined with CCK-8 kit. depletion of cellular cholesterol by MCD impairs BRV entry. cells were pretreated with different concentrations of MCD followed by BRV infection for 12 h. the virus titers increased by 2.0 log10. mg/ml exogenous cholesterol for 1 h followed BRV infection. each experiment was performed in triplicate. the results were representative of three independent experiments. integrins 21, 41, v3, x2, heat shock cognate protein (hsc) 70 and certain gangliosides were identified as cellular molecules responsible for rotavirus entry [29,30] cholesterol depletion impairs the entry of BRV UK strain [26], but BRV strains have various VP4 (P-types) and VP7 (G-types) genotypes. cholesterol depletion from cellular membrane influences BRV entry by disturbing lipid-raft-dependent endocytosis. this suggests that virus replication is independent of lipid rafts. the mechanism of noneveloped viruses assembly and release is poorly understood. rotavirus VP4 protein has been demonstrated to directly interact with lipid microdomains. lipid rafts disrupted by MCD impaired the mature of BRV particles. plasma membrane cholesterol was essential to BRV entry and assembly. the monolayer MA-104 cells cultured in 12-well plates were treated without or with various concentrations of MCD at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. the monolayer cells seeded in 12-well plates were infected with BRV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 at 4\u00b0C for 1 h. cells were washed three times with PBS and supplied with serum-free medium. after washing, cells were infected with BRV at 4\u00b0C for 1 h. at 12 hpi, virus titers and viral mRNA levels were determined. the realtime PCR reaction was performed with the SYBR Select Master Mix. the primer set designed for BRV VP7 gene contains BRV-VP7-F (5\u2032-TAA ATG GAT ATC AAT GGG TT-3\u2032). cells, viruses and chemicals MA-104 africa green monkey cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. the cells were treated with increasing concentrations of MCD at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. cholesterol-depleted or cholesterol-replenished cells were collected and diluted in 1X Amplex Red Reaction Buffer. the concentration of cholesterol was detected by the Amplex Red cholesterol Assay Kit (Life Technologies, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. cells were washed with PBS to remove unbound virus, then shifted to 37\u00b0C. at 12 h post infection, cells were harvested and subjected to Western blot assay. effect of cholesterol depletion on post-entry stage of BRV infection. -actin gene contains -actin-F (5\u2032-AAC GTC AGT AAT TAC CAG C-3\u2032) and -actin-R (5\u2032-GTG ATC TCC TTC TGC GA CGT G-3\u2032) the PCR reaction was performed with ABI7500 Fast Realtime PCR (Applied Biosystems, USA) the funding organizations had no role in the study design, data collection and analysis, ownership of the materials or preparation of the manuscript."}
