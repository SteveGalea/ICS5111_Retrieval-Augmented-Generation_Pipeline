{"summary": "Gap junctions span the plasma membranes of closely opposed cells to align end to end, forming intercellular channels which allow the exchange of small molecules (less than 1 kDa) they are composed of two hemichannels contributed by two opposing cells. connexin proteins consist of an intracellular N terminus, four transmembrane domains, two extracellular loops, one cytoplasmic loop, and an intracellular C terminus. GJCs allow the passage of small molecules, e.g., glucose and its derivatives (11), and second messengers, such as inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, cyclic AMP (cAMP), and ca2+ (12\u201315). a lot is known about Cx43 coupling in CNS cells, but its implication was not studied very well until the early 1990s. astrocyte-targeted deletion of Cx43 and Cx30 leads to dysmyelinating phenotype in mice. changes in astrocytic structure and morphology are characteristic features of human MS. prenatal human influenza virus infection in mice induces downregulation of Cx43 in neocortex and cerebellum. MHV-induced alteration of Cx43 expression in primary astrocytes and in vivo in the CNS of MHV-infected mice. in vitro and in vivo studies showed that there was a downregulation of Cx43 expression both at RNA and protein levels. the alteration of expression of Cx43 in astrocytes may play a role in MHV-induced neuroinflammation. primary cultures of mixed glia from newborn mice were prepared as described previously (34), with minor modifications. culture flask was thoroughly agitated in an orbital incubator shaker. cells suspended in the culture medium then were removed. the remaining adherent monolayers of astrocytes were used as enriched glial cultures for further experimentation. astrocyte-enriched cultures showed 26.3% 3.4% higher GFAP expression (normalized to internal control actin) than mixed glial cultures. primary astrocytes were immunostained with FITC-labeled anti-GFAP antibody. a total of 86.6% of cells were positive for GFAP. infected cells were kept in astrocyte-specific medium containing 10% normal serum. cultures were subjected to different cell biological and biochemical assays. permeabilization was done with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) cells were washed, centrifuged, labeled with goat anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated secondary antibody for 30 min at room temperature. cells were resuspended in 200 l of flow buffer and subjected to flow cytometry. the whole-cell lysates were resuspended in Laemmli's sample buffer. protein content was measured using the Pierce bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit. insoluble fraction initially was resuspended in PBS with 1% Triton X-100 prior to dilution. the gap junction functional coupling between astrocytes was determined using scrape loading of Lucifer yellow (LY) in confluent monolayers of primary astrocytes as described previously (41) cDNA was synthesized from 1 g of total RNA with random primers and MultiScribe reverse transcriptase from a high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit. cDNA samples were treated with 0.5 l RNase H (Escherichia coli RNase H;

2U/l stock; Invitrogen) for 1 h. cDNA samples from astrocytes and brain tissues were subjected to real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis. the resulting amplified fragment of 601 bp was analyzed by 1.2% agarose gel electrophoresis. mice perfused transcardially with PBS, followed by cold PBS containing 4% PFA. brains were harvested in 4% PFA for 6 h and then placed at 4\u00b0C for 4 h in 10% sucrose, followed by 30% sucrose overnight. sections were sectioned sagitally with the help of Cryotome (Thermo Scientific) to 10-m thickness. tissues then were incubated for 1 h at RT with 1 M glycine in PBS. sections were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with a primary antiserum diluted in blocking serum, washed, and subsequently incubated with secondary antiserum diluted in PBS with GS for 2 h at one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to make statistical comparisons between three experimental groups. for all experiments, statistical significance was set at P 0.05. primary astrocytes were infected with MHV-A59 at MOIs of 1 and 2. primary astrocytes were mock infected (A, C, and E) or infected with MHV-A59. cells were subjected to double-label immunofluorescence at 12 h (A and B), 24 h (C and D) and 36 h (E and F) p.i. with anti-Cx43 antisera (red) and anti-N antisera (green) infected astrocytes, positive for viral nucleocapsid (N protein), showed typical Cx43 staining at the cell surface. at 12 h p.i., the majority of cells were infected and showed intracellular localization of Cx43. this altered localization of Cx43 was independent of visible cytopathic effect. at 36 h p.i., similar retention of Cx43 was observed in virus-infected cells only. intracellular compartment retained Cx43, mostly colocalized with ER marker calnexin. astrocytes were mock infected or infected with MHV-A59. immunoblotting was performed on proteins isolated from mock-infected astrocytes. primary astrocytes were either mock infected or infected with MHV-A59. total protein was extracted at 24 h p.i. and 5 g of total protein was loaded for immunoblotting. the total proteins isolated from primary astrocytes also were probed for GFAP. expression was found to be similar in all experimental groups. astrocytes were 3.49- 0.25-fold reduced compared to levels for mock-infected astrocytes. this downregulation was statistically significant (***, P 0.001) the qPCR product was resolved in 4% agarose gel. amplicon-specific product was visualized. reduced gap junction plaque formation due to infection using triton X-100 solubilization. primary astrocytes were infected with MHV-A59 at an MOI of 2. a membrane-enriched fraction was isolated from homogenized cells from each culture. then protein was solubilized in the presence of 1% Triton X-100 at 4\u00b0C. soluble fraction ratio was calculated for mock-infected astrocytes. soluble fraction ratio was significantly lower for mock-infected astrocytes. ly is a small molecule (457 Da) that moves freely through gap junctions. due to MHV-A59 infection there was a clear alteration of Cx43 mRNA expression, protein expression, and trafficking to the cell surface. ly dye spread was significantly reduced, 46.3% 0.6% (for an MOI of 2; **, P 0.01) and 53.6% 5.96% (for an MOI of 5; **, P 0.01), compared to that of infected cells. downregulation of Cx43 expression in vivo in MHV-A59-infected mice. mice were intracranially inoculated with MHV-A59 at 50% of the LD50 or with PBS-BSA for mock-inoculated mice. 0.06-fold downregulation of Cx43 compared to that of mock (n = 3)-infected mice. total protein was extracted from mouse brains and probed for Cx43 as well as -actin. total protein also was probed for the astrocyte marker GFAP. a major reduction in phosphorylated isoforms was observed upon MHV infection. mice were infected intracranially with MHV-A59 at 50% of the LD50. mice were sacrificed at day 5 p.i., after which their liver and brain tissues were processed for RNA extraction. cDNAs from liver were amplified for virus-specific antinucleocapsid primers. the nonphosphorylated form of Cx43 (42 kDa) expression was reduced 20.1%. a 43.2% reduction was observed in phosphorylated forms of Cx43 (44 kDa and 46 kDa) after viral infection. MHV-A59 infection during the chronic phase did not alter Cx43 protein expression in vivo. MHV-A59-infected mice were double immunolabeled for GFAP (red) and viral N (green) protein (A to F) or Cx43 (red) and viral N (green) protein (G to L) cells were counterstained with DAPI. colchicine-treated cells showed Cx43 was distributed in an intracellular compartment. a pattern similar to that observed in virus-infected cells. astrocytes were treated with 100 M colchicine, a known microtubule-depolymerizing agent. primary astrocytes were mock infected (A) or infected with MHV-A59 at an MOI of 1 (B to E) and subjected to double-label immunofluorescence with anti-Cx43 antisera (red) and antiviral nucleocapsid (N) antisera (green) at this low viral dose, syncytia were not present, even at 36 h p.i. in MHV-A59-infected cells Cx43 was localized primarily in the intracellular compartment. a single cell from the confluent astrocyte monolayer is shown at higher magnification in an inset. a single cell from the confluent astrocyte monolayer is shown at higher magnification. both at 12 and 24 h p.i., the alteration of Cx43 expression was restricted to virus-infected cells only. at 36 h p.i., similar retention of Cx43 was observed in virus-infected cells only. localization of Cx43 was observed predominantly at the cell surface. primary astrocytes were mock infected or infected with MHV-A59 at 2 and 5. subjects were subjected to double-label immunofluorescence at 24 h p.i. with anti-Cx43 antisera (red) and anti-calnexin (green) or anti-cop antisera (green) expression was downregulated compared to the level for the control. GFAP expression was found not to be altered upon virus infection. primary astrocytes were either mock infected or infected with MHV-A59. differences in expression levels between groups infected at MOIs of 2 and 5 were not statistically significant. reduced expression of Cx43 protein implies increased degradation and/or reduced synthesis. further experiments were performed at an MOI of 2 at 24 h p.i.. the end products of the qPCR of Cx43 and an internal control, -actin, were resolved in a 4% agarose gel and are shown in panel B. compared to levels for mock-infected controls, a reduction in both the total membrane fraction and the Triton X-100 insoluble fraction was observed upon. the amount of Cx43 present in the total membrane fraction was reduced 38.4% 6.9% in virus-infected cells compared to the level for mock-infected cells. most of the Cx43 (81.6% 3.2%) was pooled in the Triton X-100 insoluble (Ins) fraction, whereas only 18.4% 3.3% was pooled in the soluble (Sol) fraction. MHV-A59-infected astrocytes accumulated large amounts of Cx43 in the Triton X-100 soluble fraction (50.6% 2.5%). ly is a small molecule (457 Da) that moves freely through gap junctions from loaded cells to neighboring ones. MHV-A59 infection could be the basis of reduced functional gap junction communication between astrocytes after virus infection. astrocyte monolayers were infected with MHV-A59 at MOIs of 2 and 5 for 24 h. the cells were scrape loaded with Lucifer yellow (LY) which was allowed to diffuse through gap junctions. amplification of viral N gene resulted in a specific PCR product obtained from virus-infected mice, but no amplicon was observed for mock-infected mice. total protein was extracted from mouse brains and probed for Cx43 as well as -actin. total protein was also probed for the astrocyte marker GFAP. id proteins were detected from the CNS of infected mice. the change of Cx43 expression was specifically regulated by MHV infection. the nonphosphorylated form of Cx43 (42 kDa) expression was reduced 20.1% after MHV-A59 infection. a 43.2% reduction was observed in phosphorylated forms of Cx43 (44 kDa and 46 kDa) after viral infection. qPCR analysis of RNA samples from brain showed a 3.13- 0.06-fold reduction in relative abundance of Cx43 mRNA after MHV-A59 infection. total protein was extracted from brain, and 20 g of protein was resolved in SDS-PAGE. infection in mouse brains was confirmed by the presence of viral nucleocapsid protein. in situ immunofluorescence data on infected brain tissue demonstrated alteration of Cx43 in astrocytes present in mouse brain following MHV-A59 infection. frozen sections were immunostained with either GFAP (red) and viral N (green) or Cx43 (red) and viral N (green) protein, followed by counterstaining of the nucleus with DAPI (blue) abundant punctate Cx43 staining was observed in mock-infected brain tissue. significant loss of Cx43 staining was observed in MHV-A59-infected brain tissue. primary astrocytes were treated with colchicine in absence of virus. untreated astrocytes showed characteristic punctate staining of Cx43 at the cell surface. in colchicine-treated astrocytes, Cx43 was localized mainly in the intracellular compartment. MHV-A59 infection induced the downregulation of Cx43 at both mRNA and total protein levels. kDa isoforms of Cx43 are known to be located primarily in cell membrane and to form gap junction plaques. astrocytes were infected by MHV-A59 in vivo at day 5 p.i. Upon infection, expression of Cx43 was downregulated and localization was found to be altered in and around infected regions of brain. MHV-A59 proteins are also targeted to the Golgi apparatus (GA), inducing fragmentation of the GA and rearrangement of the microtubule network (55). astrocytes have similar retention of Cx43 in the intracellular compartment, as seen in virus-infected astrocytes. oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) production and myelination by mature oligodendrocytes (56) loss of Cx43 may result in secondary loss of Cx47 at astrocyte/oligodendrocyte GJCs (57) previous studies have shown that deletion of astrocytes Cx43 and Cx30 (10) or oligodendrocytes Cx47 and Cx32 (58) can cause pathological conditions featuring demyel the current study in a virus-induced neuroinflammatory model suggests a cause-effect relationship between viral infection, trafficking and expression of Cx43 and potentially subsequent demyelination. the lack of intercellular communication between glial cells may be one of the major cellular determinants of chronic progressive demyelination."}
