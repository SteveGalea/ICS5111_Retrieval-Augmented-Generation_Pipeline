{"summary": "bovine coronavirus (BCV) and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) infections are currently wide-spread in the Swedish dairy cattle population. no investigations have yet been performed regarding the prevalence and geographical distribution of both infections. bovine coronavirus (BCV) and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) are frequently involved in the respiratory and enteric disease complexes of cattle. BRSV is one of the most important causes of respiratory tract disease in beef and dairy cattle, especially in young animals. every 12th blood sample was systematically selected for an investigation of Neospora caninum in Swedish beef cattle [20] between November 2006 and may 2007, every 12th blood sample was systematically selected for an investigation of Neospora caninum in Swedish beef cattle. the number of blood samples taken per herd ranged from 1 to 8 but most herds were represented by one or two samples (81 and 14%, respectively) applied postal codes were available for 2,757 samples from 2,131 beef herds. prevalence was defined as the number of positive samples over the total number of samples and was calculated for each PCA. no overlapping of the circles/ellipses was allowed. no overlapping of the circles/ellipses was allowed. this test indicated that these herds were proportionally distributed over Sweden. this test indicated that these herds were proportionally distributed over Sweden. every 12th blood sample was systematically selected for an investigation of Neospora caninum in Swedish beef cattle. the same study sample consisted of 2,763 serum samples originating from 2,137 herds, corresponding to approximately 20% of all beef herds present in the country at this time. applied postal codes were available for 2,757 samples from 2,131 beef herds in the study population. spatial distribution of samples and possible clustering were investigated by following the same procedure. cluster sizes of 50, 20 and 10% of the total population at risk were built to identify both high-risk and low-risk clusters. no overlapping of the circles/ellipses was allowed. this test indicated that these herds were proportionally distributed over Sweden. animals testing positive to BRSV were predominately located in central-western and southern Sweden, as well as in some northern areas. the northern areas were no longer considered having high prevalences for BCV. two areas with low prevalence of BRSV were also identified. the characteristics of the identified clusters are displayed in Table 1. Figure 3. Areas with high or low prevalences of (a) BCV and (b) BRSV. the risk for a PCA to be part of a cluster of high prevalence was 5.3 times (95% CI: 2.5-11.1) higher if its beef herd-density was >10 herds/100 km2. this risk was 6.1 times (95% CI: 2.4-15.1) higher for BRSV. a proportion of infected herds and of infected individuals within these herds could have been missed. both high prevalence areas have a relatively high density of beef herds. this suggests a positive association between herd-density and risk of infection. studies suggest organic herds may have a reduced risk of BCV and BRSV infections compared to conventional herds. results of such studies would enlighten the choice of relevant strategies to control BCV and BRSV infections. authors declare that they have no competing interests. the final manuscript was submitted by the Swedish Dairy Association. the Swedish dairy association provided blood samples and information from the database."}
