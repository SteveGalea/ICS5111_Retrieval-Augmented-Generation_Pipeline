{"summary": "all materials moved from a higher level of biocontainment to a lower biocontainment level must be proven to be sterile or undergo a valid and verified method of agent inactivation. this involves inoculating a portion of the material or biological agent containing the sample to be moved to a medium capable of supporting growth of the target organism. the media and assays used to detect viable organisms will vary depending on the target agents. inactivation procedure may be moved to a lower biocontainment level, transported, and disposed of without a sterility test. the material subjected to the process is considered sterile. sterility tests are not performed on every sample that undergoes autoclaving as a method of disposal. the toxicity of the TRIzol LS in undiluted, treated viral samples causes almost immediate death of the cell culture layer used for sterility testing. previous studies have diluted the TRIzol LS-inactivated samples 100- and 1000-fold and still observed tissue culture cell death. the photo-crosslinking property of psoralens has been exploited to inactivate microorganisms in the blood supply [13,14,15] for the treatment of skin disorders [16], to inactivate viral pathogens prior to organ transplantation, and for inactivation of viruses for potential vaccines [17,18,19,20]. Neither exposure to psoralens alone nor exposure to long-wave UV light alone was sufficient to inactivate DNA or RNA viruses fluent cultures were inoculated at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001 and propagated in minimal Essential Medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic (product number 15240-062, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2. the culture supernatant was collected, centrifuged at low speed to remove cell debris. aliquots from each time point were placed into wells of a 96-well plate containing Vero cells at 95% confluency. the aliquots were serially diluted 1:10 in the plates for a total of 11 dilutions. aliquots were serially diluted 1:10 in the plates for a total of 11 dilutions. the injected virus antigen was clarified supernatant centrifuged at 4\u00b0C for 15 min. the minimum pre-inactivation or live titer for injected viral antigen was 1.0 106 TCID50/mL. ouse KPL 6 JUNV Ascitic fluid ATCC 2 Goat anti-rabbit KPL MERS-CoV Rabbit polyclonal Sino Biological 4 Goat anti-rabbit KPL DENV Mouse monoclonal GenWay Biotech 5 Goat anti-rabbit KPL 1 EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA. 50 L/well of live and psoralen-inactivated DENV at a concentration of 1.7 107 cells were stained with a monoclonal antibody to DENV envelope protein (3H5) or an IgG1 isotype control (BD Biosciences), followed by a FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate) labeled secondary goat-anti-mouse IgG antibody (NBACC) cells not treated with virus served as the negative control. -9 F NS4B AGTTCTCTCGCCATTG 961 this study DENV-9 R GAGTGTTCTCCTTCCA DENV-9 P AAAAGAGCAGCGGCGGGCAT DENV-3 F RdRp/NS5 TACAACATGATGGGAGAGAAAAA 265 [28] DENV-3 R GTGTCCCAGCCGGCGGTGTCATCAGC DENV-3 P AAGAGACGGCC DENV-11 F NS5/UTR AGAGAGAGA RNA Extraction Total RNA was extracted from psoralen-treated cell supernatants using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) RNA purity was assessed using a Qubit\u00ae 2.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies) and the Qubit\u00ae RNA HS Assay Kit (Life Technologies) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. reactions were processed on an Applied Biosystems 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Life Technologies) raw sequences were analyzed using Sequencher 5.3 software. Next generation sequencing Total RNA prepared from psoralen-inactivated DENV was reverse transcribed using random primers and superscript\u00ae III Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies) following manufacturer\u2019s instructions. AMT was added at a final concentration of 10 g/mL to a DENV-2 stock of 106.4 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) per milliliter. the plates were exposed to UV-A radiation (365 nm; Multiple-Ray Lamp, Ultra Violet Products, Upland, CA, USA) for 0, 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, or 60 min at a measured energy level of 200 W/cm2. EBOV required 120 min UV-A exposure for full inactivation. at each time point, an aliquot was removed from the plates. each aliquot was assayed for viability by virus isolation in Vero cells. a portion of each culture supernatant was placed into new cell culture flasks containing Vero cell monolayers at 95% confluency. flasks were incubated at 37 \u00b0C at 5% CO2 for 10 days and periodically observed for CPE. the resulting cell monolayers were scraped and applied to microscope slides following the method of Hsiung [26] the cells were washed, fixed, and permeabilized using the BD Cytofix/CytopermTM kit. the fixed cells were stained with a monoclonal antibody to DENV envelope protein (3H5) or an IgG1 isotype control. FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate) labeled secondary goat-anti-mouse IgG antibody (NBACC) cells not treated with virus served as the negative control. the percent of 3H5 positive cells represented the number of cells that captured and internalized DENV using the DC-SIGN receptor. RNA Extraction Total RNA was extracted from psoralen-treated cells using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) all extracted RNA samples were eluted in a volume of 120 L. RNA purity was assessed using a Qubit\u00ae 2.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies) and the Qubit\u00ae RNA HS Assay Kit (Life Technologies) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. cDNA was amplified with the Ready-to-Go GenomiPhi V3 Kit (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) and a Nextera\u00ae XT library (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) was prepared for sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq platform following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions in protocol \u201cPaired-end 2 150 bp\u201d (Illumina) 50 (50% tissue culture infectious dose), cytopathic effects (CPE) and IFA after inactivation with 4\u2032-aminomethyl-trioxsalen (AMT) and ultraviolet light. psoralen-mediated virus inactivation was achieved for all viruses tested. VEEV 20,000 Arenaviridae enveloped, spherical, ssRNA(-) LASV 30,000 JUNV 90,000 Bunyaviridae enveloped, spherical, ssRNA(+) MERS-CoV 6000 Filoviridae filamentous, ssRNA(-) MARV 150,000 EBOV 120,000 Flaviviridae enveloped, spherical, ssRNA(+) DE five microliters of fully inactivated JUNV produced a cycle threshold (Ct) of 32.13, LASV 19.48, RVFV 32.07, MARV 18.08, and EBOV 21.03. each inactivated virus produced an amplicon of the expected size. RNA isolated from psoralen-inactivated preparations was reverse-transcribed, amplified, and subjected to whole genome sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq. Approximately 98% of the DENV genome was covered in 13,909 of 203,040,312 total reads. antibodies produced in response to live and 4\u2032-aminomethyl-trioxsalen (AMT) + UV-A inactivated Lassa virus and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus recognized untreated viruses equally well. this suggests the antigens on the surface of both live and inactivated viruses were recognized equally well. the level of fluorescence was significantly lower than the level observed in the positive control cultures containing live virus. after subculture and a second 10-day incubation, the level of fluorescence was very low and nearly indistinguishable from the negative control cultures. the virus was completely inactivated by the AMT and UV-A treatment. Flow cytometry was used to establish that viruses inactivated with AMT were still competent to interact with DC-SIGN cellular receptors. psoralen-inactivated DENV was captured and internalized to the same extent as live DENV in host cells. psoralen-inactivated DENV was captured and internalized to the same extent as live DENV in host cells. 40 minutes of exposure to UV-A light in the presence of AMT was required to fully inactivate DENV. TCID50 (50% tissue culture infectious dose), cytopathic effects (CPE) and IFA after inactivation with 4\u2032-aminomethyl-trioxsalen (AMT) plus ultraviolet light. each virus treatment was replicated a minimum of eight times. UV-A required to inactivate different viruses in the presence of 4\u2032-aminomethyl-trioxsalen. five representative viruses were tested for competence in reverse-transcription real-time PCR after inactivation with AMT. five microliters of fully inactivated JUNV produced a cycle threshold (Ct) of 32.13, LASV 19.48, RVFV 32.07, MARV 18.08, and EBOV 21.03. each inactivated virus produced an amplicon of the expected size. RNA isolated from psoralen-inactivated preparations was reverse-transcribed, amplified, and subjected to whole genome sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq. Approximately 98% of the DENV genome was covered in 13,909 of 203,040,312 total reads. titer of each antibody was similar in the serum. antigens on the surface of both live and inactivated viruses were recognized equally well. EBOV preparations in cell culture were incubated for 10 days at 37 \u00b0C. some fluorescence was visible within the cells, indicating that the virus had been recognized by cell-surface receptors and internalized. the level of fluorescence was significantly lower than the level observed in the positive control cultures containing live virus. Flow cytometry was used to establish that viruses inactivated with AMT were still competent to interact with DC-SIGN cellular receptors and become internalized. psoralen-inactivated DENV was captured and internalized to the same extent as live DENV in host cells. method of inactivating virus preparations was extended to multiple virus families. the method was effective at inactivating Alpha-, Arena-, Bunya-, Corona-, Filo-, Flavi- and orthomyxoviruses. each virus tested required a different amount of UV-A exposure in the presence of AMT. the polyclonal antibodies produced against inactivated virus worked equally well for detecting untreated virus compared to antibodies produced against live virus preparations. this will allow viruses inactivated by this method to be used in vaccine development, in antibody generation for research, or studied by microscopy. the viral nucleic acids were non-infectious and sufficiently undamaged in DENV to be appropriate substrates for real time PCR. the UV-A exposure time and AMT concentration required to inactivate each virus is affected by viral titer and is species-specific. this method could provide rapid access to virus preparations and genomic material from pathogenic samples quickly and safely."}
