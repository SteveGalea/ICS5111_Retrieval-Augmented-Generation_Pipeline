{"summary": "intestinal mucosa acts as a barrier between inner part of the body and external environment. a large number of pathogens are rapidly eliminated by protective mucosal immune responses. intestinal immune system must be able to discriminate harmless antigens from harmful ones. stressors challenge homeostasis of animals by inducing systemic or local inflammatory responses coincident with neuro-endocrine alteration. reducing stress would significantly improve gut homeostatic balance of livestock. heat stress is becoming a critical stress factor for health in the swine industry. inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-, were not up-regulated. it could well be that HS together with LPS does not induce all pro-inflammatory cytokines and perhaps are linked with specific cytokines. HS induces alteration of barrier function coincident with gut inflammation in pigs. it appears that the influence of HS together with the solution to overcome the effects of HS on pigs\u2019 immune system should be further investigated. nutritional stress Growth performance is the most critical factor in the pig industry. permeability of porcine gut epithelial cells within 48 hrs. DON stimulated pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-, IL-6, and IL-1 expression in jejunum and ileum. it is apparent that TLR2 ligand can prevent damage of porcine gut epithelial cells treated with DON. il-23p40, IL-1, and vasoactive intestinal peptides were increased in ileum Peyer\u2019s patches after 42 days feeding of zearalenone (0.1 mg/kg) to pigs for 28 days. T-2 toxin reduced viability of intestinal epithelial cells in pigs infected with Salmonella Typhimurium. enteric pathogens disrupt the homeostasis of the epithelial barrier. some pathogens induce intestinal damage through osmotic stress. others cause diarrhea by up-regulating pro-inflammatory cytokines. pathogenic E. coli has been known to cause diarrhea accompanied by dehydration. PDCoV and TGEV are still critical enteric coronaviruses in swine industry. PDCoV and TGEV are less prevalent than E. coli or PEDV. PDCoV showed synergic pathology when co-infected with PEDV. it is assumed that this virus is derived from the same ancestor as porcine coronavirus. heat stress is becoming a critical stress factor for health in the swine industry. inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-, were not up-regulated. it could well be that HS together with LPS does not induce all pro-inflammatory cytokines.
