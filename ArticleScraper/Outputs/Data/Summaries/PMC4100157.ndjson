{"summary": "human microbiologic infections, known as zoonoses, are acquired directly from animals or via arthropods bites. more than two thirds of emerging human pathogens are of zoonotic origin, and of these, more than 70% originate from wildlife. RNA viruses represent more than 70% of the viruses that infect humans. hematophagous arthropods, wildlife and domestic animals may serve as targets for zoonotic and arboviral disease surveillance. these patterns of transmission allow identifying different animals to follow in order to monitor the appearance of new or re-emerging infectious agents before its first detection in the human populations. viruses can be identified by a wide range of techniques, which are mainly based on comparisons with known viruses. many viruses cannot be cultivated, excluding the use of cell line isolation and serologic techniques, and can only be characterized by molecular methods. viral metagenomics has allowed the discovery of causative viral agents of disease conditions. the use of viral metagenomics as a tool for arboviral and zoonotic disease surveillance requires prior knowledge of the viral diversity associated to hematophagous arthropods and animals. arthropods require a blood meal for their survival, either for their gonotrophic cycle or for feeding. if an arthropod feeds on a vertebrate host, it injects saliva into the host\u2019s blood. such arthropods are called vectors. medical entomology has therefore studied vector-host relationships for the last century. thropoda Arachnida Ixodidae Hard tick Flaviviridae (TBEV, OHFV) Bunyaviridae (CCHFV, SREV, WNV) Bunyaviridae (SOLV) [29,30] Argasidae Soft tick Flaviviridae (AHFV, SREV, WNV), Bunyaviridae (SOLV) [31,32,33,34] Insect c Fever virus (OHFV), Colorado Tick Fever virus (CTFV), alkhurma Hemorrhagic Fever virus (AHFV), Saumarez Reef virus (SREV), West Nile virus (WNV), Soldado virus (SOLV), Kaeng Khoi virus (KKV), Hepatitis B virus (HBV), lacrosse virus (LACV), Jamestown Canyon virus (SFNV), toscana virus (TOSV), Yellow Fever not documented Inoviridae [24] Anopheles sp., Ochlerotatus sp., small RNA virome Reoviridae (Orbivirus), Birnaviridae (Entomobirnavirus), Flaviviridae *, Bunyaviridae ** (Phlebovirus) not documented. papillomaviridae detected in mosquitoes have a human origin. Circoviridae have mainly a bird origin. no potential zoonotic viruses were documented in this study. avirus genus is divided into 4 major groups (Bunyamwera, Wyeomyia, Simbu and California encephalitis). phylogenetic analyses performed on L and M segments of the newly described orthobunyaviruses did not place them into a specific group, nor provided information regarding a vertebrate host origin. but their identification in anthropophilic mosquitoes coupled with their ability to replicate in mammalian cells may presuppose a the family Parvoviridae, sub-family Densovirinae. they are small, non-enveloped icosahedral ssDNA viruses. they infect the majority of arthropods. they are responsible for the death of their host. papillomaviridae detected in mosquitoes have a human origin. Circoviridae have mainly a bird origin. no potential zoonotic viruses were documented in this study. zoonotic viruses transmitted by arthropods may presuppose a human or other mammalian origin. the RNA virome of arthropods, especially mosquitoes, is poorly described and is a future challenge for arbovirus surveillance. the \u201cOne Health\u201d concept recognizes that human health is linked to animal health and the environment in which they co-evolve. DNV seem to be highly host-specific, and because they infect most tissues of their hosts, they are responsible for the death of their arthropod host. other insect-specific viruses were detected by Cook et al. [28] using the same small RNA-based metagenomic technique, including chronic bee paralysis virus and viruses belonging to the Birnaviridae family. wildlife Zoonosis Virus Vector-Based Transmission Domestic Animal Intermediate Host Ref.
