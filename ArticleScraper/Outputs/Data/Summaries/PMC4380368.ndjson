{"summary": "measles is one of the most transmissible diseases in existence, with at least a 90% infection rate in susceptible populations. measles can mimic influenza, croup, bronchiolitis or pneumonia before the rash occurs. most clinicians in industrialized countries have never seen even a single case of measles. this initial sign occurs after an incubation period of 1\u20132 weeks following exposure (average 10\u201312 days) the eyes have a characteristic appearance, typically showing erythema of the palpebral conjunctiva with nonpurulent discharge. patients may also report malaise, myalgias, anorexia, and diarrhea. ecchymosis and erythematous macules coalesce into patches within about 48 hours. by the time a rash develops, within 1\u20132 days, patients will be ill appearing. after 5\u20137 days, the exanthem begins to fade, forming coppery-brown patches that may desquamate. atypical measles was first reported in the late 1960s and early 1970s. it was often mistaken for Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever. in patients who receive post-exposure prophylaxis with serum immunoglobulin, a modified variety of measles can occur with similar but milder signs and symptoms. the vast majority of patients with measles who are well-nourished (not vitamin A deficient) recover; however, measles can lead to several complications and even death. even previously healthy children can become severely ill and require hospitalization. measles is a major cause of death in refugee camps where vitamin A deficiency is common, immunity is poor, and conditions are crowded. all persons should be vaccinated against measles unless there is a medical contraindication to live virus immunization. some patients are too young to be vaccinated, i.e., those under 12 months of age. this reluctance to vaccinate is based in part on a 1998 study. this reluctance to vaccinate is based in part on a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. admission criteria for measles patients are similar to those for others. but there are special considerations for patients being discharged. infected patients must be isolated from others and public health must be notified. patients with signs and symptoms of measles should be immediately masked and isolated using airborne precautions. all healthcare providers, including those who have been vaccinated, should do N95 respirators prior to caring for suspected measles patients. the rash of measles generally erupts about 14 days after exposure. the rash begins on the face and progresses cephalocaudally to the torso and extremities. patients who are immunocompromised may present atypically and may not develop a rash. patients who are immunocompromised may present atypically and may not develop a rash. if a rash develops, children or adult patients should avoid public places. a classic triad of cough, coryza and conjunctivitis is often present. the eyes have a characteristic appearance, typically showing erythema of the palpebral conjunctiva with nonpurulent discharge. patients may also report malaise, myalgias, anorexia, and diarrhea. the rash of measles begins on the face and progresses cephalocaudally to the torso and extremities. assessing the pattern of rash evolution is essential to identify measles patients. by the time a rash develops, within 1\u20132 days patients will be ill appearing. atypical measles was first reported in the late 1960s and early 1970s. in patients who receive post-exposure prophylaxis with serum immunoglobulin, a modified variety of measles can occur with similar but milder signs and symptoms. the population most at risk for measles is those persons exposed, but not immunized, or with inadequate immunity. the vast majority of patients with measles who are well-nourished (not vitamin A deficient) recover; however, measles can lead to several complications and even death. even previously healthy children can become severely ill and require hospitalization. measles is a major cause of death in refugee camps where vitamin A deficiency is common, immunity is poor, and conditions are crowded. measles is a major cause of death in refugee camps where vitamin A deficiency is common, immunity is poor, and conditions are crowded. there is a medical contraindication to live virus immunization. some patients are too young to be vaccinated, i.e. those under 12 months of age. there has been a movement in the u.s. by parents to avoid or delay vaccination based on personal, philosophical beliefs. osure Prophylaxis and Precautions Infants under six months of age should receive passive immunity with intramuscular immune serum globulin. nonimmune/nonimmunized pregnant women should receive a standard vaccination. other nonimmunized persons who are exposed to measles should receive vaccination as well. Identify-Isolate-Inform tool initially developed for measles virus disease4 can be modified for the ED evaluation and management of patients under investigation for measles virus. the first branch of the algorithm involves determination of whether the patient is symptomatic or asymptomatic. the goal is prevention of disease in both the individual and the population. public health authorities must be immediately notified 24/7. clinicians should promptly inform the hospital infection control and prevention practitioner on duty. Identify-Isolate-Inform is a tool for EPs to apply when patients may have measles present to the ED."}
