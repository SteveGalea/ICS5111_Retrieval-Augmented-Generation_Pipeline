{"summary": "acute respiratory infections (ARI) are the most common reason for oral antibiotic prescriptions in the united states. overuse of antibiotics has been linked to several negative outcomes, including development of antibiotic resistance, antibiotic-associated infections, increased costs, and drug toxicities. major inclusion criteria included age >1 year, new fever 100.5 \u00b0F within the past 3 days, and new onset of cough or sore throat within the past 7 days. the study was approved by the governing institutional review board for each enrolling center. FebriDx results indicating elevated MxA were interpreted as viral infection. validation tests showed no elevated CRP or MxA were interpreted as negative. reference testing algorithm classified patients as having a bacterial infection if any of the following 5 criteria were met. the reference testing algorithm classified patients as having a bacterial infection if any of the following 5 criteria were met. reference testing algorithm classified patients as having a viral infection if any of the following 3 criteria were met. if a patient met criteria for both a viral and viral infection, the patient was classified as bacterial. the majority of PCT data in the literature is related to bacteremic patients, sepsis. physicians reviewed each case together and came to a consensus classification of bacterial, viral, or negative. results were reclassified as viral vs not viral. results were reclassified as viral vs not viral. negative results collapsed into a 'not viral' group. sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values were separately calculated. asymptomatic control population also enrolled a convenience sample of asymptomatic control participants. major exclusion criteria included recent history of trauma or surgery, use of antibiotics, antiviral agents, interferon therapy, immunosuppressive therapy or a live viral immunization within the past 30 days. the study was approved by the governing institutional review board for each enrolling center. x results indicating elevated MxA, regardless of CRP level, were interpreted as viral infection. study personnel at the site obtained a whole blood sample by finger stick. results were interpreted as bacterial, viral or negative. reference testing algorithm classified patients as having a bacterial infection if any of the following 5 criteria were met. the reference testing algorithm classified patients as having a viral infection if any of the following 5 criteria were met. NP/OP sample PCR positive for influenza A or B, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus, or parainfluenza viruses 1\u20134. if a patient met criteria for both a viral and viral infection, the patient was classified as bacterial. the majority of PCT data in the literature is related to bacteremic patients, sepsis and those with lower respiratory tract infections. physicians reviewed each case together and came to a consensus classification of bacterial, viral, or negative. the final reference standard classification (bacterial, viral, or negative) consisted of an algorithm-guided consensus decision by 2 physicians who were blinded to the FebriDx results. negative predictive values were separately calculated for bacterial and viral detection. these calculations were repeated after stratifying the study population into 3 age groups (18 years; 18\u201350 years; and >50 years) asymptomatic control population was enrolled to test FebriDx specificity in people without any signs or symptoms of infection.

Diagnostic accuracy of FebriDx for identifying (A) bacterial and (B) viral infections compared to the reference standard in the upper respiratory tract infection population. five patients had false negative FebriDx results for bacterial detection. one had a throat culture positive for GABHS with PCT of 0.1 ng/mL. the second had an NP/OP PCR positive for Chlamydophila pneumoniae with PCT of 0.73 ng/mL. a small subset of 26 patients had a documented versus a reported fever. the rate of microbiologically unconfirmed cases was 28%. the test demonstrated 100% (4/4) bacterial sensitivity, 95% (21/22) specificity, 82% (9/11) viral sensitivity, and 87% (13/15) viral specificity. the first patient had a throat culture positive for heavy growth of Group A beta hemolytic Streptococcus (GABHS) and a PCT value of 0.09 ng/mL that was thought to more likely represent a bacterial infection in the presence of GABHS culture. the second case demonstrated a negative microbiology testing but an elevated PCT of 0.14 ng/mL and elevated WBC count of 10.5 thousand cells/mcl (Table 2). fluenza NP/OP positive PCR and IgM positive for EBV 3 3 EBV Throat culture negative or contaminant, PCR negative or contaminant, and PCT between 0.15 ng/mL and 0.25 ng/mL, and WBC 15 k. no bands present 3 1 none 1 Enterobacter gergoviae 1 Group B Streptococcus Negative 127 Throat culture negative or contaminant, P/OP PCR diagnosis of FebriDx FebriDx classified 32 (15.6%) patients as bacterial, 72 (35.1%) as viral, and 101 (49.3%) as negative. overall agreement between FebriDx and reference standard algorithm was 76.6%. five patients had false negative FebriDx results for bacterial detection. one had a throat culture positive for GABHS with PCT of 0.73 ng/mL. the remaining 3 patients had negative bacterial cultures and PCR tests. asymptomatic control results showed a sensitivity of 86% (75\u201394), specificity of 88% (76\u201388), PPV of 78% (52\u201374) and NPV of 93% (90\u201397) among 33 patients with influenza detected by RT-PCR, 29 (88%) had a viral result by FebriDx. FebriDx results were negative for 161 of 163 asymptomatic control subjects. sensitivity of the test was higher in children with a lower specificity compared to the other age groups. FebriDx provides qualitative measurements (high vs not high) of CRP and MxA. it is based on the limitation of the filmArray\u00ae Respiratory Panel for detecting other viral pathogens such as parechoviruses, human bocavirus, and specifically enterovirus-68. patients with infectious respiratory symptoms and a CRP below this 20 mg/L threshold are likely to have non-bacterial, or self-limited infections [9,34,35,36,37,38]. briDx also includes MxA as a marker of viral infection. the long serum half-life of MxA, with elevated levels detectable up to 10 days after viral infection, provides a distinct advantage for use as a biomarker. our final reference standard for etiology (bacterial vs viral vs negative) also included a physician over-read of algorithm results to allow for clinically-logical classification. lack of definitive etiology for respiratory infections has been recognized as a major unmet need in medicine. in 83 patients presenting with pharyngitis, GABHS alone was found in 8 (9.6%), GABHS together with virus in 11 (13.3%), group C or G b-hemolytic streptococci (GCBHS, GGBHS) alone in two (2.4%), group C or G b-hemolytic streptococci (GCBHS, GGBHS) alone in two (2.4%), GCBHS or GGBHS together with virus in three low association of bacterial co-infection in patients with URI is consistent with the low 2% co-infection rate found by M\u00e4kel\u00e4 et al. another study of 506 patients suggests a higher co-infection rate of 8% based on the detection of rising CRP levels at subsequent office visits. 38% of patients with microbiologically confirmed viral infection had an elevated CRP 20 mg/L. 17% had an elevated PCT 0.1 ng/ml which could contribute to overtreatment. the strength of the FebriDx test rests in its high NPV that reduces the likelihood of missing a clinically significant bacterial infection. 99% of uninfected children have CRP 10 mg/mL [63] putto et al. found 89% showed a CRP elevated over 20 mg/L. pneumonia could be excluded in patients with CRP values below 10 mg/L and in patients without dyspnea or daily fever with values between 11 and 50 mg/L. despite extensive testing, 62% of our URI patients were classified as having negative etiology by the reference standard. despite extensive testing, 62% of our patients were classified as having negative etiology by the reference standard. the FebriDx test was sensitive and specific for identifying clinically-important viral and bacterial infections in febrile outpatients."}
