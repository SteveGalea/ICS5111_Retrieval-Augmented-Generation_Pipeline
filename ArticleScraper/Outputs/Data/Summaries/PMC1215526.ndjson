{"summary": "the mammalian host uses ubiquitous and redundant antiviral defence mechanisms. the redundancy ensures that other systems are ready to take over, if one of them fails. a viral infection of an individual thus involves a conflict between the virus and the host. humans and herpesviruses have evolved together. phylogenetically old viruses are well adapted to the human host. herpesviruses are capable of coping with the human immune defence in a balanced manner. icosahedral DNA viruses with a capsid of approximately 100 nm are enveloped. the envelope holds at least 10 different glycoproteins protruding from the outer side. the glycoproteins are responsible for attachment to cellular receptors and fusion of membranes. the capsid is composed of a complex icosahedral structure of 162 capsomeres, each with a central channel running from the outside to the interior of the capsid. inside the capsid the double stranded linear DNA is packed as a spool with the ends in close proximity. the genome consists of a long (L) and a short (S) segment which are covalently linked. gD binding to the heparan sulfate-containing cellular receptors is reversible. a crucial step is then conducted by gD binding to an entry receptor. this includes herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM) and nectin-2 (HveB) membrane fusion can take place both with the plasma membrane on the surface of the target cell and with an endosomal membrane after intraluminal pH-reduction. the potential importance of signalling through receptors involved in adsorption and membrane fusion is only scarcely analysed. ICP0 is active in inhibiting immune mechanisms such as interferon production and antiviral effects of interferons. the progeny is formed in the nucleus of the infected cell, where the viral DNA is packed into preformed capsids. the route of virus from here to the external side is controversial. the progeny virus acquires the envelope from other membranes, than the inner nuclear lamella, as it is indicated by analysis of membrane lipids. the progress of HSV infection in tissues is influenced by the capacity of HSV to infect adjacent cells directly through cell junctions. gE and gI are crucial for this kind of polarised transmission which takes place in epithelial infections. the aetiology of herpes genitalis has changed in several countries. in some areas of the world the proportion of genital infections caused by HSV-1 is still low (4\u201320 %) in others the relative proportion of genital herpes caused by HSV-1 is increasing. in some areas of the world the proportion of genital infections caused by HSV-1 is still low (4\u201320 %) primary genital HSV infection is most often asymptomatic, especially in younger children. however, some individuals experience a symptomatic primary infection with vesicular herpetic gingivostomatitis or in adolescence more often a pharyngitis. a primary genital HSV infection can be both asymptomatic and symptomatic with ulcerative lesions and with or without generalized symptoms such as fever, headache etc. neonates with a generalized infection had a one-year mortality of approximately 60%, those with CNS-infections had intermediary mortality, and nearly no mortality was seen in the group of patients with only mucocutaneus involvement [119]. a day after initiation of high-dose acyclovir treatment, the mortality and sequela rates have dropped. the capacity for regeneration is small, and larger necroses induced by viral infection will result in life-long sequelae [119,123]. a delicate balance exists between the direct HSV-induced pathology and the immunopathology induced by immune reactions to the virus. the scarification from this infection has even been attributed to autoimmunity by molecular mimicry. macrophages are now more precisely defined as an important member of the mononuclear phagocyte system, defined in 1969 by van Furth and colleagues. in the tissues they constitute a dynamic pool of cells with many functional capabilities, among which the capacity of phagocytosis, microbial killing, motility, and adherence to surfaces are classic. in the tissues the monocytes differentiate into macrophages with characteristics determined by environment of the tissue in question [141] local proliferation in the tissues is performed by newly recruited monocytes. of the monocytes produced in the bone marrow of mice and passing through the blood, approximately half are targeting the liver, 15 % are going to the lungs, 25 % to the spleen and 7 % to the peritoneal cavity. lymphocytes and soluble factors secreted by these (lymphokines) are important in activation of macrophages for killing of intracellular bacteria. interferon (IFN)- was shown to be an important stimulator of macrophage activation. toxic substances of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide seem to conduct their action in synergy. a numerical nomenclature of interleukins (between leukocytes) was introduced in 1979. a numerical nomenclature of interleukins (between leukocytes) was introduced in 1979. the cytokines are generally smaller proteins, some composed of two subunits, utilizing specific receptors on target cells for induction of their functional effects. IFNs are a diverse group of cytokines, consisting of IFN-, IFN-, IFN-, IFN-, IFN-, IFN-, and IFN-/limitin. the first five of these are expressed in humans and mice. the functional importance of such a diversity is largely unknown. new studies show the importance of the diversity could come from varying expression patterns of different IFN- species. most of the IFNs are N-glycosylated, but glycosylation does not correlate with activity of the molecule, but rather with in vivo stability. recombinant IFNs are shown to have activity comparable with that of the naturally produced molecules. a human homolog of IFN- could thus have interesting potential in the therapy of tumours and viral infections. for many years IFN- was thought only to be expressed by T cells. in recent years it has been clear that other cell types are in fact capable of IFN- expression. IFN- exerts its effects through a distinct class II cytokine receptor, the IFN- receptor (IFNGR), composed of two subunits, IFN-R1 and IFN-R2. Activated JAK1 in turn phosphorylates IFN-R1, which allows binding of the STAT1 homodimer to the receptor and subsequent phosphorylation of STAT1. mice with deficient IFN-, IFNGR, or STAT1 expression have shown that this system is of major importance, but not vital, in the host response to viral infections. a new group of IFN-like cytokines has been described in various species and named IL-28A (IFN-2), IL-28B (IFN-3), and IL-29 (IFN-1) [171,220]. these cytokines are antiviral proteins interacting with a distinct the pro-TNF is synthesized as a 26 kDa transmembrane pro-TNF. it is cleaved by a metalloprotease releasing the 17 kDa extracellular portion of the molecule. production and release of TNF from the cell is regulated at both the transcriptional and translational level. signalling from the TNF receptor family induces a balance between life and death. the TNF superfamily seems to have evolved with the adaptive immune system in vertebrates and is crucial for the embryonic development of lymphoid tissue. IL-12 is produced by monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils and B cells. the cellular source was found to be dendritic cells, but cultured macrophages also produced IL-12p40 upon HSV-2 infection. this difference could be brought about by differences in the requirement for co-stimulation with IFN-. IL-12 and IFN- in conjunction are the main responsible factors for activation of a Th1-driven adaptive cellular immune response. IL-12 stimulates proliferation of nave T cells and in conjunction with IFN- inhibits Th2 cell differentiation and the production of Th2 cytokines. IL-12-induced IFN- production is synergistically enhanced by other cytokines such as TNF and IL-1 [240] IL-4 and IL-13 inhibit IL-12 induction in early stages of stimulation. but later they can be potent inducers of IL-12 production. IL-12 cytokine family also includes two other heterodimeric cytokines. IL-27 is the newest recognized member of the IL-12 family. it is constructed of two distinct subunits (EBI3 and p28) but still with functional capacities. other cytokines, like IL-15, are also implicated in development, function and activation of these cells. IL-4 is the ligand of two receptors: a high-affinity heterodimer of IL-4R and the IL-2R common -chain and another heterodimeric receptor composed of IL-4R and IL-13R1. IL-13 binds to three complexes: a high-affinity heterodimer of IL-13R and IL-4R and two homodimers composed of either IL-13R1 or IL-13R2. profile IL-4 has in vivo been shown to confer some resistance to HSV infection. herpes simplex Viruses are ubiquitous viruses generally infecting humans early in life. the virus is phylogenetically old and humans and herpesviruses have evolved together. the genetic map of the two herpes simplex viruses is colinear. the genomes are of approximately the same size, HSV-1 of 152 kbp [7] and HSV-2 of 155 kbp, and code for corresponding genes. the tegument consists of several viral proteins involved in the initial phases of viral infection and replication. the tegument is composed of a complex icosahedral structure of 162 capsomeres. inside the capsid the double stranded linear DNA is packed as a spool with the ends in close proximity. the viral transcriptional chain is closed by some of the tegument proteins (e.g. VP16/Vmw65) which are -gene products with structural properties in the tegument of the viral particle. the viral transcriptional chain is closed by some of the tegument proteins (e.g. VP16/Vmw65) which harbour transcription-inducing capacity upon -gene promoters crucial in the induction of the next replication cycle of the the differential use of these receptors is of importance for HSV entry of different cell types and infection of polarized cells. the membrane fusion can take place both with the plasma membrane on the surface of the target cell and with an endosomal membrane after intraluminal pH-reduction. the potential importance of signalling through receptors involved in adsorption and membrane fusion is only scarcely analysed. a key event in this seems to be early induction of latency-associated transcripts (LATs) with sequences antisense to the infected cell protein null (ICP0) and ICP4 [65-67]. IE-gene products intimately regulate cellular functions in favour of viral replication and immune evasion. antigen processing blocks the presentation of viral peptides by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-I. the virus is formed in the nucleus of the infected cell, where the viral DNA is packed into preformed capsids. the route of virus from here to the external side is controversial. in a minority of cases vesicular or ulcerative lesions are seen. differences in the anatomical distribution of these infections. in the last decades changes in prevalence and distribution of HSV infections have been seen. aetiology of a genital infection is not insignificant, in that the frequency of recurrence is higher in HSV type 2-infected individuals than in those infected with type 1. more women are seronegative at delivery and thus a higher number have the risk of caching a primary HSV infection. reactivations at labour only seem to pose a minor risk for neonatal infection of the baby. 70% of neonates infected are born by asymptomatic women. maternal antibodies also seem to be protective for the neonate. pathology of HSV infections is caused by a direct cytopathic effect of the virus, resulting in cellular lysis and focal necrosis of the infected area. in the brain, however, the capacity for regeneration is small, and larger necroses induced by viral infection will result in life-long sequelae [119,123]. herpes simplex virus enveloped with icosahedral DNA viruses with a capsid of approximately 100 nm. the envelope holds at least 10 different glycoproteins protruding from the outer side. the capsid is composed of a complex icosahedral structure of 162 capsomeres, each with a central channel running from the outside to the interior of the capsid. the genome consists of a long (L) and a short (S) segment which are covalently linked [28], and contains a high density of genetic information with about 94 open reading frames (ORF) HSV infection is initiated by adsorption of the viral particle via gB or gC to a cellular receptor, which is a heparan sulphate chain on cellular proteoglycans. this initial binding is of greater significance for HSV-1 than for HSV-2, a divergence which could have implications for the different pathogenic patterns of the two strains. membrane fusion can take place both with the plasma membrane on the surface of the target cell and with an endosomal membrane after intraluminal pH-reduction. the potential importance of signalling through receptors involved in adsorption and membrane fusion is only scarcely analysed. transcription factors for the next wave of viral proteins, intimately regulate cellular functions in favour of viral replication and immune evasion. the progeny is formed in the nucleus of the infected cell, where the viral DNA is packed into preformed capsids. ICP0 is active in inhibiting immune mechanisms such as interferon production and antiviral effects of interferons. the progeny virus acquires the envelope from other membranes, than the inner nuclear lamella, as it is indicated by analysis of membrane lipids. the progress of HSV infection in tissues is influenced by the capacity of HSV to infect adjacent cells directly through cell junctions. the overall prevalence of HSV infection is very different in different countries and ethnic and social populations. in some areas of the world the proportion of genital infections caused by HSV-1 is still low (4\u201320 %) in others the relative proportion of genital herpes caused by HSV-1 is increasing [97,98] more women are seronegative at delivery and thus a higher number have the risk of caching a primary HSV infection. a symptomatic primary infection with vesicular herpetic gingivostomatitis or in adolescence more often a pharyngitis. a genital HSV infection can be both asymptomatic and symptomatic with ulcerative lesions. a third of cases were mucocutaneus infections only involving the skin, mouth and eyes. one third were disseminated infections involving multiple organs, including the liver, lungs, adrenals, and often the CNS. neonates with a generalized infection had a one-year mortality of approximately 60%. in the brain, the capacity for regeneration is small, and larger necroses induced by viral infection will result in life-long sequelae. a delicate balance exists between the direct HSV-induced pathology and the immunopathology induced by immune reactions to the virus and the toxic and functional side effects of these reactions. macrophages are now more precisely defined as an important member of the mononuclear phagocyte system. the macrophages originate from the bone marrow, where proliferating promonocytes give rise to monocytes which migrate to the tissues. macrophages are strategically situated all over the body taking care of debris from the organism itself and foreign material. macrophages in tissues are, as described above, in part originating directly from monocytes. in the steady state situation they only constitute a small fraction of the mononuclear phagocytes present. in the lungs, 70% of tissue macrophages in the steady-state originate from monocyte influx and 30% from local proliferation. activation of macrophages has been a focus of interest for many years. it became clear relatively early that lymphocytes and soluble factors secreted by these (lymphokines) are important in activation of macrophages for killing of intracellular bacteria. interferon (IFN)- was shown to be an important stimulator of macrophage activation. the term cytokine was introduced by Dumonde et al. in 1969 to describe lymphocyte derived factors. the term monokine was used as a description of factors coming from the mononuclear phagocyte system, both acting on many cells, primarily leukocytes. a numerical nomenclature of interleukins (between leukocytes) was introduced in 1979. the IFNs were described and named in 1957 by Isaacs and Lindenmann. the substances involved in the previously described interference of one virus with the replication of another unrelated virus and the interfering activity of inactivated influenza virus with the subsequent infection of chorio-allantoic membranes. the IFNs are divided into three major groups. new studies show correlation between antiproliferative and antiviral effects of different IFN- species. most of the IFNs are N-glycosylated, but glycosylation does not correlate with activity of the molecule. the natural IFN- and - have a molecular weight of 19 \u2013 26 kDa and most species retain stability at pH 2 [189] the newly discovered IFN-/limitin interacts with the IFN-/ receptor. antiviral activity of IFN- has been shown against many viruses including HSV. a human homolog of IFN- could thus have interesting potential in the therapy of tumours and viral infections. IFN- exerts its effects through a distinct class II cytokine receptor, the IFN- receptor (IFNGR), composed of two subunits, IFN-R1 and IFN-R2. Upon binding of a homodimer of IFN- to the receptor complex, JAK2 autophosphorylates and then transphosphorylates JAK1. a new group of IFN-like cytokines has been described in various species. these cytokines are antiviral proteins interacting with a distinct heterodimeric class II cytokine receptor composed of IFN-R1 and IL-10R2. they share with the type I IFNs some intracellular signalling pathways through the ISRE. TNF is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein coded from the human chromosome 6 and from chromosome 17 in mice. it is synthesized as a 26 kDa transmembrane pro-TNF, primarily located in the membranes of the golgi apparatus. production and release of TNF from the cell is regulated at both the transcriptional and translational level and by post translational modification. the activator protein 1 (AP-1) is activated by mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and together with NF-B primarily acts in the proinflammatory pathways. signalling from the TNF receptor family induces a balance between life and death (apoptosis) of the cell. IL-12 subunits are coded from different chromosomes, i.e. the human chromosomes 3 and 5 and the mouse chromosomes 6 and 11, respectively [235] these genes are regulated separately, and coordinated induction in the same cell is required for secretion of the biologically active IL-12p70 heterodimer [236]. IL-12 is produced by monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils and B cells IL-12 stimulates proliferation of nave T cells, and in conjunction with IFN- inhibits Th2 cell differentiation and the production of Th2 cytokines. IL-12-induced IFN- production is synergistically enhanced by other cytokines such as TNF and IL-1 [240], and IFN- production can even be induced in macrophages by co-stimulation with IL-18. IL-4 and IL-13 cytokines inhibit IL-12 production in early stages of stimulation. but later they can be potent inducers of IL-12 production. the small IL-12 cytokine family also includes two other heterodimeric cytokines, IL-23 and IL-27. IL-27 is the newest recognized member of the IL-12 cytokine family. other cytokines, like IL-15, are also implicated in development, function, and activation of these cells. IL-4 and IL-13 repress the induction of IL-12, and thus put a brake on the positive feed-back loop of IFN- production. IL-4 is the ligand of two receptors: a high-affinity heterodimer of IL-4R and the IL-2R common -chain and another heterodimeric receptor composed of IL-4R and IL-13R1. IL-13 binds to three complexes: a high-affinity heterodimer of IL-13R and IL-4R and two homodimers composed of either IL-13R1 or IL-13R2. IL-4 is thus not only an inhibiting cytokine but essentially an immunomodulatory cytokine with regulatory effects on macrophages. the interferons were described and named in 1957 by Isaacs and Lindenmann [170] who described the substances involved in the previously described interference of one virus with the replication of another unrelated virus. the IFN- family consists of multiple species in both humans and mice. 13 IFN- genes and one pseudogene have been identified. in mice 14 IFN- genes and 3 pseudogenes have been identified. the functional importance of such a diversity is largely unknown. type I IFNs exhibit antiviral and antiproliferative effects. stimulation of immune cells such as T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells, increased expression of MHC-I, activation of pro-apoptotic genes and inhibition of anti-apoptotic mechanisms. induction and production of IFN- in antigen-presenting cells and NK cells is conducted by cytokines, especially IL-12 in synergy with other proinflammatory cytokines. IFN- exerts its effects through a distinct class II cytokine receptor, the IFN- receptor (IFNGR), composed of two subunits, IFN-R1 and IFN-R2. IFN- has antiviral activity, but the most important effects of IFN- seem to be activation of macrophages, antigen-presenting cells, and NK cells. inhibition of T-helper type 2 (Th2) cells resulting in a Th1-driven cell-mediated response to infection. a new group of IFN-like cytokines has been described in various species. TNF is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein coded from the human chromosome 6 and from chromosome 17 in mice. it is synthesized as a 26 kDa transmembrane pro-TNF, primarily located in the membranes of the golgi apparatus [225] production and release of TNF from the cell is regulated at both the transcriptional and translational level and by post translational modification. signalling from the TNF receptor family induces a balance between life and death. TNFR1 also activates NF-B (p50/p65) besides inducing apoptosis, TNFR1 also activates NF-B (p50/p65) the p35 subunit has homologies to IL-6, and p40 is homologous to the extracellular domain of the haematopoietin receptor family. the two IL-12 subunits are coded from different chromosomes, i.e. the human chromosomes 3 and 5 and the mouse chromosomes 6 and 11, respectively. these genes are regulated separately, and coordinated induction in the same cell is required for secretion the primary effect of IL-12 is induction of IFN- production in NK cells and T cells. IL-12 activates the cytotoxic potential of these cells. IL-12 stimulates proliferation of nave T cells and inhibits Th2 cell differentiation. IL-10 is regulated in a positive feed-back loop by IL-12. cytokines possessing anti-inflammatory properties inhibit IL-12 production. cytokines inhibit IL-12 production in early stages of stimulation. IL-23 drives IL-17 production of NK cells, which mobilizes neutrophils and promotes production of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-6, and TNF. other cytokines, like IL-15, are also implicated in development, function, and activation of these cells [267,268]. IL-4 suppresses the production of other pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF and IL-1. IL-4 and IL-13 are potent inhibitors of the efferent arm of the pro-inflammatory system. production of these effectsor mechanisms is hampered by inhibition of production of the responsible enzymes in these reactions. IL-4 was discovered in 1982 on the basis of another important effect of the cytokine, namely the ability to induce proliferation of B cells. despite the anti-inflammatory profile IL-4 has in vivo been shown to confer some resistance to HSV infection. the control of viral replication and dissemination during the first days of an HSV infection seems to be vital for the final outcome. mice infected intra-peritoneally or intra-venously experience a generalized infection with HSV replication in most organs, including the liver, spleen, and eventually the brain. the course of infection in mice also depends on the type of HSV in question. mice treated with mercuric chloride showed higher titres of HSV-2 in the first days of infection, an effect which could be correlated to impaired production of IFN-/. the genetic background for the X-linked trait of HSV resistance and IFN-/ production of macrophages remains unravelled. TLR9-KO mice are still capable of controlling HSV infections in vivo. however, in mouse macrophages the TLRs do not seem crucial for IFN-/ induction upon HSV infection. this is in agreement with the observation that the majority of IFN-/ produced by spleen cells and dendritic cells was independent of TLR9 or MyD88. KO mice, viral replication seemed unchanged or slightly increased during the first 4 days of infection. pathological changes and mortality were reduced. there are no indications that this pathway is implicated in IFN induction in cells during HSV infection. transcription factors involved in induction of the various IFN-/ genes are the heterodimeric NF-B family, which is activated by TLRs, IL-1R, and TNFR. many regulatory mechanisms of NF-B activation exist, one of them exerted through TNF, which is produced by macrophages very early during HSV infection. the responsible mechanisms might be exerted by other regulatory signals, influencing the magnitude of the HSV-triggered IFN-/ induction 40-ligand, a member of the TNF family, showed decreased IFN-/ production when infected with HSV-1. these patients apparently show a normal response to viral infections. the effector mechanisms of the IFN-/ system are not fully elucidated. in the original publication on genetics of HSV susceptibility in inbred mice, Lopez reported fibroblasts from the different mice to replicate HSV equally. in line with these results, the IFN-activated OAS was induced to a higher degree in cells from the resistant mice upon IFN-/ treatment. the macrophage antiviral activity has been described as intrinsic or extrinsic. the macrophages are thus a blind end for the HSV infection. they can inactivate virus outside the macrophage itself or inhibit viral replication in other cells. macrophages are activated and achieve an increased capacity to react with a respiratory burst of ROS when appropriately triggered, i.e. by phorbol esters. this capacity peaked after only 8 hours of infection with HSV [353] genetics of the efferent part of the IFN-/-mediated HSV-induced activation of macrophages appear to be expressed in different cell-types. sensitivity to IFN-/ seems to be expressed in different cell-types. the influence of TNF on the genetics of this phenomenon has not been addressed. spleen cells on the initial phase of a generalized HSV infection in suckling mice were conducted by IFN-/ [360]. administration of a hematopoetic growth factor to neonatal mice increases the number of dendritic cells, B cells and NK cells, and confers resistance in a cutaneous model of HSV infection. mice infected intra-peritoneally or intra-venously experience a generalized infection with HSV replication in most organs, including the liver, spleen, and eventually the brain [284] the course of infection in mice also depends on the age of the mice, as is the case in humans. treatment of mice with antibodies to IFN-/ increases and accelerates mortality of a generalized HSV-1 infection. mice treated with mercuric chloride showed higher titres of HSV-2 in the first days of infection, an effect which could be correlated to impaired production of IFN-/. transmembrane pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) detect redundant microbial molecular motives and induce antiviral and proinflammatory cytokines in response to alerting signals. in dendritic cells, TLR9-signalling, induced by the GC-rich HSV genome, has been shown to govern the induction of IFN-/. however, in mouse macrophages the TLRs do not seem crucial for IFN-/ induction upon HSV infection some of the TLRs are coded from the X-chromosome [312], which are triggered by guanosine- or uridine-rich ssRNA in the endosomal compartment of cells. there are no indications that this pathway is implicated in IFN induction in cells during HSV infection. cells from the relatively resistant mice show an early induction pattern of IFN-/, peaking within 2 hours, whereas cells from the susceptible mice demonstrate a delayed response, peaking 7 hours after induction. many regulatory mechanisms of NF-B activation exist, one of them exerted through TNF, which is produced by macrophages very early during HSV infection. patients with this X-linked immunodeficiency show aggravated herpetic infections. cells from patients with another X-linked immunodeficiency showed decreased IFN-/ production when infected with HSV-1. this supports the notion above that other regulatory signals might be involved. fibroblasts from the same mouse strains replicate HSV equally. the same was found in the cells showing differential sensitivity to IFN-/. the level of stimulated and unstimulated OAS was generally found to vary between different strains. macrophages are activated and possess an increased antiviral potential. the antiviral activity has been described as intrinsic or extrinsic. a potential antiviral mechanism of macrophages may be the production of ROS. macrophages are activated and achieve an increased capacity to react with a respiratory burst of ROS when appropriately triggered, i.e. by phorbol esters. this capacity peaked after only 8 hours of infection with HSV [353] the genetics of the efferent part of the IFN-/-mediated HSV-induced activation of macrophages appears to be reversed. the influence of TNF on the genetics of this phenomenon has not been addressed. the genetics concerning the antiproliferative effect of IFN-/ in bone marrow cells seems to be reversed. the effects of adult mouse spleen cells on the initial phase of a generalized HSV infection in suckling mice were conducted by IFN-/. the effect in this model could also be attributed to the actions of IFN-/, with some additional contributions by IFN-. innate and adaptive immune systems exhibit much redundancy, and that IFN-/ is of vital importance in local inhibition of HSV replication. reactions take place within the first 6 to 12 hours of a HSV infection. cytokines such as IL-12, IL-18 and IFN- are produced and give rise to other weapons in the battle against the virus. in vivo production of IL-12p40 and IFN- in draining lymph nodes. high doses of UV-inactivated virus were used. some minimal transcription of viral genes could have taken place. a marked synergism between HSV and IFN- in IL-12 induction has been demonstrated. the IL-12 / IFN--inducing activity of the produced IL-12 is pronounced in mouse peritoneal cells after 24 hours of infection. synergistic action of IL-12 and IL-18 in IFN- production by macrophages was shown to be dependent on STAT4. IFN- has also been shown to act in synergy with IL-12 in IFN- induction. this further emphasizes concept of positive feed-back mechanisms in regulation of early IFN- production. infected mice produce several cytokines, including IL-12, which stimulate production of IFN-, primarily in NK cells. IFN- then induces NO production in macrophages and stimulates the direct antiviral activity of IFN-/ in other cells. IL-12, -23 / IFN- system is able to control the infection, affecting both the survival rate and the HSV titres early in infection. ovirus (MCMV) production of IL-12-induced IFN- by NK cells has been demonstrated in vivo. the system was further shown to lower the viral titres. a review of genetic functional NK cell defects found NK cells and their innate IFN- production to be of central importance in herpesvirus infections. iNOS-mRNA in infected mouse peritoneal cells and corneal neutrophils is induced. the production of NO in HSV-infected cultures is dependent on the virus being infectious. this is in line with the requirement of infectious HSV for IL-12 production. iNOS is induced synergistically though TNF-induced NF-B activation and translocation to the nucleus, as shown by binding of a heterodimeric complex of p55/p65 and a homodimer of p55 to the nucleus of the iNOS promoter. antibody to TNF inhibit activation of NF-B and production of NO in HSV-infected cells. IRF-1 induces transcription of the IRF-1 and iNOS genes. IRF-1 interacts physically with NF-B, binds to the distal B-binding site of the iNOS promoter region. only when NF-B is absent, IRF-2 can bind to the ISRE site. NO has been shown to confer a substantial part of the antiviral activity induced by IFN- in a macrophage cell line. an exogenously added donor of NO has in several cell lines been shown to reduce the replication of HSV. in vivo, analysis of mice treated with an inhibitor of NO production showed higher titres of HSV in the lungs but increased survival rates due to reduced inflammation. NO production in the early stages of HSV infection is one of the effector mechanisms of the innate immune response inhibiting HSV replication. but when overproduced, NO might itself result in pathology. positive feed-back mechanisms exist at the afferent side of the early cytokine response. i.p. production of IL-4 could be detected at day 5 of infection. at low IFN- concentrations, IL-4 has been shown to inhibit iNOS induction. this results in reduced expression of the transcription factor IRF-1. this is crucial for induction of iNOS gene transcription induced by IFN-. IL-4- and IL-13-induced inhibition of iNOS induction can thus be overruled by HSV infection, leading to a sustained NO production. pre-treatment with IL-4 has in a Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus model showed inhibition of NF-B activation. IL-12p40 production in early HSV infection appears to be inflammatory cells, including macrophages, and not the infected stromal cells. the IL-12 induction during viral infection requires infectious virus, and it was shown to be regulated at the transcriptional level [238]. IL-12 has in a mouse model been shown to stimulate TNF expression [255], indicating that TNF can participate in a negative feed-back loop in the regulation of the IL-12 system. the implication of such inhibition by IFN-/ and TNF, which are secreted very early in HSV infections, has so far not been elucidated. elicited peritoneal macrophages, HSV induced efficient IFN- production through cooperation of IL-12, IFN-/ and IL-18 [377] synergistic action of IL-12 and IL-18 in IFN- production by macrophages was shown to be dependent on STAT4. ergism between IFN- and TNF in inhibition of HSV replication in corneal cells has been shown to be mediated by activation of a tryptophan-depleting enzyme. the effect was greatly dependent on the cell type examined, which could explain the above-mentioned inconsistency. IL-12 was shown to participate in the immune pathogenesis in KO mice. but in another study utilizing IL-12 encoding plasmid DNA, corneal expression of IL-12 reduced the angiogenesis, and thus the pathology of the infection. both studies agreed that IL-12 does not affect the local titres of HSV in the eye. review of genetic functional NK cell defects found NK cells and their innate IFN- production to be of central importance in herpesvirus infections. it can be concluded that the IL-12 / IFN- system is active in HSV infections and possesses an important antiviral potential, capable of controlling viral replication during the early phases of infection. mice with targeted disruption of the TNF gene showed impaired resistance to HSV and increased viral replication within the first days of infection. antibodies to TNF and an inhibitor of NO production impaired early control of HSV infection in peripheral nervous tissue. iNOS mRNA could be detected after about 18 hours of infection. iNOS induction could involve complex formation of IFN- and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1. IRF-1 interacts physically with NF-B, binds to the distal B-binding site of the iNOS promoter region. IRF-2 can bind to the ISRE site and block transcription. IFN--induced production of iNOS can be inhibited by IL-4. Upon HSV infection they produce TNF which synergizes with the IFN--induced pathways and inhibits the inhibitory signals of IL-4. this opens up for an otherwise closed pathway. weanling mice with a targeted disruption of the iNOS gene showed increased HSV replication. in adult KO mice, we could not detect any significant effect of NO during the early days of a generalised HSV infection. the final effects of NO on HSV infections therefore appear to be balanced between antiviral versus toxic effects. NO inhibits replication of influenza virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. iNOS gene induction in IFN- activated macrophages is conducted by IL-4 and IL-13 [272,273,434]. IL-4 production during HSV infection has in vaginal and CNS infections. IRF-2 is known to compete with binding of IRF-1 to ISRE sites. induction of IRF-2 could thus be mediated by STAT6 binding to this element. another mechanism could evolve from observation that IL-4 signalling can result in disruption of the complex formation of ICSBP and IRF-1 and thereby inhibit iNOS induction. the NF-B p65 physically interacts with IRF-1 and trans-activate iNOS transcription in HSV-infected and TNF-treated cells. it is therefore tempting to speculate that the NF-B-IRF-1 complex has higher affinity for the combined DNA-binding site. this will block the inhibiting effect of IL-4 in foci of HSV replication and open up for NO production at sites where the antiviral effect is of more importance than the potential toxicity. future analogues of IFN-/ seem obvious as candidates for adjuvant treatment of severe HSV infections. this could be supplemented with IL-12, which would give highest IFN- production in foci of HSV infection because of other cytokines such as IFN-/, TNF and IL-18 being present there."}
