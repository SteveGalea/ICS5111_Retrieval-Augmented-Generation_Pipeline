{"summary": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM; World Health Organization [WHO] grade IV glioma) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor in the united states. the disease claims 13,000 lives, with most succumbing in 1\u20132 years. despite the relatively short time course of the disease, the financial burdens at a familial level are staggering. neoplastic heterogeneity observed in GBM poses significant challenges in disease treatment as well-known oncological therapeutics fail to target the entire disease burden. the inability to cure GBM via neurosurgical resection and the failure of our current therapeutics contribute to the urgent need for further GBM tumor characterization. biofluid-based biomarkers will be essential tools. EVs are membrane-enclosed, virus-sized (30\u20131,000 nm) nanovesicles released extracellularly from cells. extracellular release deposits EVs into systemic or circulating fluids. EVs are stable and protect constituents from nucleases, proteases, and other means of degradation found in the biologically harsh extracellular environments. EVs also have physicochemical properties that enable their purification via standard procedures. recurrent genetic abnormalities are able to subcategorize GBMs into groups defined as Classical, Mesenychmal, Proneural, and Neural. the main features of these designations are shown in Table 1. the main features of these designations are shown in Table 1.

EGFRvIII appeared on the surfaces of exosomes from EGFRvIII-expressing cells. exosomes/EVs isloated from hypoxic GBM cells enhanced GBM bioactivity and induced epithelial cells to secrete tumor-promotion factors. this involved paracrine signaling via tissue factor associated with EVs. this involved increased tumor growth, migration, and vascularization and angiogenesis. EVs are present in (and purifiable from) essentially all routinely obtainable biofluids. multiplexed assays that evaluate more than one biomaterial could theoretically be performed on the same sample. EVs are known to occur in elevated quantities in the blood of cancer patients,66\u201368. EGFRvIII seems to be an excellent putative biomarker from a diagnostic perspective. it is likely that evaluation of the protein status would be the most direct assessment, but access to antibody reagents is limited. there remains concern over lack of correlation between polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based detection of EGFR and the actual protein expression levels. all but CHI3L/YKL-40 have been found in EVs. VEGF-A protein was identified in human EVs by antibody array. bFGF (also called FGF2) was found in medulloblastoma EVs. active TGF-1 has a serum half-life of 2 minutes,88 transport of it in blood may rely on EVs. other tumor-specific mutations identified in brain tumors are in the isocitrate dehydrogenases 1 (IDH1) and 2 (IDH2) cle lipid content of EVs is relatively little known about the lipid components of EVs. it is unclear whether the methods for extraction and identification of 24S-hydroxycholesterol would have encompass a significant population of extracellular vesicles. however, there may be CNS-enriched (or specific lipid markers on the EVs from CNS tumors, but their discovery is pending. the sensitivity of the technique is evident considering that IDH1 mutants are relatively rare in patients with GBM. the source of material is not a prime candidate for serial evaluation of biomarker status. miR-21 is not specific for GBMs and is also found in the EVs of healthy donors,100. it is likely that the detection of other highly abundant GBM-specific miRNAs in biofluid EVs will be possible. other aspects of extracellular vesicles relatable to biomarkers EV surfaces as interrogable landscapes. specific antibodies that recognize the brain tumor-specific gangliosides 3\u2032-isoLM1 and/or 3\u2032,6\u2032-isoLD1105 would bind to glioma exosomes. this is a relatively unexplored area in EV biology, but it may hold great promise as a means for identifying pathology-related circulating EVs. the presence of HSPs on medulloblastoma EV surfaces fits with the demonstration of the HSPs and other chaperones on the surfaces of a variety of brain tumor cells. these data suggest that location may relate to biomarker status, with tumors altering the \u201cstandard\u201d localization of proteins. newer technologies, such as nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) with fluorescent (usually antibody) staining, allows for the specific quantification of labeled vesic tumor antigens (eg, HER2) on the surfaces of circulating tumor-derived EVs have the capacity to bind and effectively titrate out therapeutic antibodies. there appear to be natural antibodies that recognize reticulocyte EVs with potential involvement in the elimination of apoptotic bodies. a lectin array was used to study the glycomes of EVs harvested from several different sources. they showed differences between the cell surface glycomes and the resulting EV glycomes, which tended to be conserved. this suggests that these surface phenomena may harbor carbohydrate biomarkers. tenascin C, CSPG4, and CD44 have been identified in EVs. there is an antibody (81C6) that specifically recognizes brain tumor tenascin C108. there is an antibody (81C6) that specifically recognizes brain tumor tenascin C108 as well as a potential therapeutic antibody against CSPG4.109. a major message here is that multiple biomarkers may be able to overcome the limitations of one or a few. surface antigens One interesting host response to tumor EVs is the antibody response against presumed surface antigens. there appear to be natural antibodies that recognize reticulocyte EVs. glycosylated surfaces of EVs are ripe for this type of probing. the glycomes of EVs are either in the form of glycoproteins, glycolipids, or surface-bound carbohydrates. this is a relatively unexplored area in EV biology. tenascin-C, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan NG2 (CSPG4), podocalyxin-like protein 1 and CD44 have been identified in EVs. there is an antibody that specifically recognizes brain tumor tenascin C108 as well as a potential therapeutic antibody against CSPG4.109. EVs were labeled with targeted magnetic nanoparticles against a four-protein signature (EGFR, EGFRvIII, podoplanin [PDPN], and IDH1 mutant) this rendered the EVs superparamagnetic and yielded faster proton decay rates for enhanced NMR signal. the combination of the four markers resulted in both high sensitivity and specificity, and the ability to quantify EVs at several logs better than current technologies. EVs may be difficult to identify and ascertain as recognizably different between tumors and normal cell types. in a further connection of tumorigenicity to a measurable readout, EVs may induce responses in model cell types that could reveal the presence of tumor. attractant We previously demonstrated that medulloblastoma cells migrated towards EVs used as attractants in Boyden chamber/transwell migration assays. some elements of EV activity may have useful, measurable outputs in the appropriate assays. signaling EVs are known to transport phosphoproteins with putative signaling potential. EVs from the sera of patients with GBM possessed the tumor-associated enzyme pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) necessary for the Warburg effect. the addition of EVs from GBM cells increased the expression of various metabolic enzymes in those recipient cells. we are likely just scratching the surface in understanding posttranslational modifications and their impacts on cargo loading into EVs. the presence of EVs in every biofluid allows for theoretically easy access in minimally or noninvasive fashion. we may need to quantify potential biomarkers, and possibly their locations in or on EVs, to distinguish the signature as distinct from normal tissue EVs. circulating fat balls can provide a window into the presence and status of the tumor that will give us a therapeutic edge in the treatment of these devastating diseases."}
