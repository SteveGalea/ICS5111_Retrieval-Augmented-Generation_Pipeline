{"summary": "culture-independent methods reveal vastly greater microbial diversity compared to traditional culture- and microscopy-based methods (typically on the order of 100:1) (4\u20136) methods were limited to quantification of only the viable (and culturable) microbes inside buildings. indoor microbiome investigations have analyzed bacterial communities using 16S sequencing and/or fungal communities using ITS sequencing. bacterial communities on surfaces in offices in Tucson, AZ, were clearly distinguishable from those in New York, NY, and San Francisco, CA. bacterial counts were higher on surfaces in several U.S. residences than in San Francisco (17). indoor fungal communities in damp buildings are often distinct from those in nondamp buildings. in buildings with prior moisture and dampness problems, indoor fungal communities are often distinct from those in nondamp buildings. the same has been confirmed in house dust samples from approximately 1,200 homes. microbes associated with human skin (and to a lesser extent, the human gut) have been shown to be ubiquitous on surfaces in a wide variety of buildings. source-tracking techniques have also been used to reveal how changes in human occupancy affect microbes on surfaces. patients appear to acquire room-associated bacterial taxa that predate their stay, but their own microbial signatures later influence the room. human occupancy in a university classroom increased the total bacterial genome concentration in indoor air nearly 2 orders of magnitude compared to unoccupied periods. Bhangar et al. used a UV-APS to measure microbial emissions from people seated in a chamber doing simulated office work. walking increased FBAP emissions approximately 5 to 6 times compared to seated office work. during both walking and sitting, more than two-thirds of the emissions were found to originate from the floor. iller et al. found that higher fungal richness was associated with a higher prevalence of air-conditioner use in homes. weikl et al. also found that variations in fungal communities in house dust were explained in part by the surrounding greenness of adjacent outdoor spaces. study assessed microbial composition on three common types of surface materials (i.e., ceiling tile, carpet, and drywall) located in three locations (i.e., on the floor, wall, and ceiling), alongside a number of built environment parameters. study adds to the evidence (15) that most indoor environments (without prior water or dampness problems) are extremely scarce in water and nutrients. mice exposed to dog-associated house dust had a distinct gut microbiome composition (i.e., enriched for Lactobacillus johnsonii) and were protected against airway allergen challenges (71). a decrease in the genus Cryptococcus was significantly associated with asthma development."}
