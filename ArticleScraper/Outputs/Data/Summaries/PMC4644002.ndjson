{"summary": "nine-month-old from northern Manitoba presented with three-day history of vesicular rash. she developed cough and fever that led to progressive vomiting, diarrhea and increased work of breathing. on admission, she required intubation and fluid resuscitation for respiratory failure and hypotension. nasopharyngeal aspirate and bronchoalveolar lavage sent for respiratory virus panel PCR. repiratory syncytial virus A and B, influenza A and B, parainfluenza 1, 2, 3 and 4, enterovirus, rhinovirus A, B and C, bocavirus 1 and 2 and human metapneumovirus were both negative. magnetic resonance imaging of the head and spine was performed on the same day. EV-A71 was the 10th most prevalent EV serotype, not including rhinovirus, detected in samples submitted to the national microbiology laboratory. a combination of active (stool samples for all cases of acute flaccid paralysis) and passive (EV genotyping) samples are used by the NML. EV-A71 produces a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations. negative PCR and positive viral culture for EV is a rare finding, occurring a few times per year, at most, based on previous experience at the Manitoba Provincial Public Health Laboratory. in 2012, a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled multicentre trial was conducted using a vero cell-based inactivated human EV-A71 vaccine. only 101 cases of EV-A71 were identified at the NML (2). the present case highlights the presence of EV-D68 in canada."}
