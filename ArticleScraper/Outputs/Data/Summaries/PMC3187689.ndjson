{"summary": "Avian infectious bronchitis virus is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus with a genome length of approximately 27 kb. the 3\u2032 end of the genome encodes four structural proteins; spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) as well as several non-structural proteins. polyproteins are post-translationally cleaved into 15 non-structural proteins (nsps) key nsps encoded include a papain-like protease 2 (PLP2) within nsp 3, a main protease (Mpro) within nsp 5 and the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) within nsps 11 and 12. different serotypes of field viruses and vaccine type viruses were selected to provide a wide variety of sequences potentially capable of contributing gene fragments to recombinants. results and Discussion 2.1.

RT-PCR reaction was carried out using strand displacement RT-PCR or one step RT-PCR. amplification reactions were carried out using strand displacement RT-PCR or one step RT-PCR. agarose gel purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit. the PCR products were cloned into the TOPOXL vector using the TOPOXL cloning kit. cloned cDNA fragments were isolated using an alkaline lysis method. the resulting cDNA was sequenced using the QIAquick gel extraction kit. the reactions were prepared for sequencing by centrifugation through either a centri-sep column (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) or using the Edge system.
