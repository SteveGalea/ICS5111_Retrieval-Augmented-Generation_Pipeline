{"summary": "hMPV is a nonsegmented negative-sense (NNS) RNA virus belonging to the family paramyxoviridae, the subfamily Pneumovirinae, and the genus Metapneumovirus (1). clinical symptoms associated with hMPV infection are similar to those caused by hRSV infection. in the early 1960s, the vaccination of infants with a formalin-inactivated (FI) RSV vaccine failed to protect the recipients against RSV disease during the following RSV season. many of the vaccine recipients developed enhanced disease upon infection with RSV, resulting in increased rates of severe pneumonia and two deaths (8). a reverse genetics system that has made manipulation of the hMPV genome possible has been developed. chimeric hMPV (rhMPV) with a G-gene deletion (rhMPV-G) was highly attenuated in vivo. the only attenuated hMPV currently in phase I human clinical trials is a chimeric rhMPV in which the P gene is derived from aMPV (20. cellular mRNA capping is catalyzed by an RNA guanylyltransferase (GTase) that reacts with GTP to form a covalent enzyme-GMP intermediate. mRNA cap methylation in NNS RNA viruses is also unique in that both guanine N-7 (G-N-7) and ribose 2\u2032-O (2\u2032-O) methyltransferase (MTase) activities are the function of CRs III, V, and VI has been mapped to the VSV L protein. STR, structure of RRMJ and VP39 identified six CRs, numbered I to VI, in L proteins. we hypothesize that inhibition of viral mRNA cap MTase can serve as a new approach to rationally attenuate hMPV for the development of live attenuated vaccines. inhibition of the viral mRNA cap MTase will likely downregulate viral gene expression and, in turn, viral replication and spread, and ultimately, it will result in viral attenuation. vero E6 cells (ATCC CRL-1586) and BHK-SR19-T7 cells (kindly provided by Apath, LLC, Brooklyn, NY) were grown in Opti-MEM medium (DMEM; Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% FBS. the medium for the BHK-SR19-T7 cells was supplemented with 10 g/ml puromycin. confluent BHK-SR19-T7 cells were transfected with 1.0 g of the minigenome plasmid together with 0.8 g of pCITE-N, 0.4 g of pCITE-P, 0.4 g of pCITE-M2-1 and 0.4 g of pCITE-L or pCITE-L mutants. rhMPVs were rescued using a reverse genetics system as described previously. rhMPV stocks used in animal studies were grown in LLC-MK2 cells. supernatant was resuspended in 2 ml of Opti-MEM medium for 2 h. RNA was extracted from 200 l of each recombinant virus using an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) a 1.4-kb DNA fragment spanning CR VI of the hMPV L-protein gene was amplified by RT-PCR using primers designed to anneal to nucleotide positions 11759 and 13199. ton X-100 was blocked at 37\u00b0C for 1 h using 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS. positive cells were visualized under a microscope. the viral titer was calculated as the number of PFU per ml. culture supernatant was removed and the cells were lysed in 200 l of radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer (pH 7.6), 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) twenty microliters of the cell lysate was denatured at 99\u00b0C for 5 min and analyzed on a 12% polyacrylamide bis-Tris gel. membranes were blocked with 5% rhMPV-specific mRNA (N mRNA) and cellular mRNA (GAPDH mRNA) were quantified by real-time RT-PCR. each rhMPV mutant was repeatedly passaged 10 times in LLC-MK2 cells. 500 ng of mRNA was incubated with 10 units of vaccinia virus G-N-7 MTase supplied by an m7G capping system (Cellscript, Madison, WI) after the methylation reaction, RNA was purified using an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen) the methylation of the mRNA cap structure was measured by determination of the level of 3H incorporation using a 1414 series scintillation counter (PerkinElmer s purified from VSV-infected cells were used for the trans-methylation assay. mRNAs synthesized in vitro or purified from VSV-infected cells were used for the trans-methylation assay. cotton rats were inoculated with 2.0 105 PFU of wild-type rhMPV. cotton rats in group 1 were mock infected with 0.1 ml of Opti-MEM medium. each cotton rat was inoculated intranasally with a volume of 100 l. cotton rats in group 7 were challenged intranasally with wild-type rhMPV or MTase-defective hMPVs at a dose of 1.0 106 PFU per cotton rat. at week 4 postchallenge, all cotton rats from each group were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation. the pulmonary histopathological changes were reviewed by 2 to 3 independent pathologists. histopathological changes were scored to include the extent of inflammation (focal or diffuse), the pattern of inflammation (peribronchiolar, perivascular, interstitial, alveolar) and the nature of the cells making up the infiltrate (neutrophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, macrophages) cotton rat sera were collected by retro-orbital bleeding weekly until challenge. twofold dilutions of the serum samples were mixed with an equal volume of DMEM containing approximately 100 PFU/well hMPV NL/1/00 in a 96-well plate. the mixtures were then transferred to confluent Vero E6 cells in a 96-well plate in triplicate. rhMPV mutants were washed three times with DMEM before adding fresh medium. at 48 h postinfection, cells were harvested and the viral titers were determined by immunostaining using vero E6 cells. the medium for the BHK-SR19-T7 cells was supplemented with 10 g/ml puromycin (Life Technologies) during every other passage to select for T7 polymerase-expressing cells. Plasmids encoding the hMPV minigenome and support plasmids expressing hMPV N protein (pCITE-N), P protein (pCITE-P), L protein (pCITE-L) and M2-1 protein (pCITE-M pCITE-L mutants were harvested using scrapers and cocultured with LLC-MK2 cells at 50 to 60% confluence. rhMPV stocks used in animal studies were grown in LLC-MK2 cells and further purified by ultracentrifugation. cells in 10 T150 flasks were infected with each rhMPV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 in a volume of 2 ml of DMEM. after 1 h of adsorption, 20 ml of Opti-MEM medium was added to the cultures. cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 6 days. anneal to nucleotide positions 11759 and 13199 based on genome sequence of hMPV strain NL/1/00, primers hMPV-L-11759-Foward and hMPV-L-13199-Reverse. PCR products were purified and sequenced at The Ohio State University Plant Microbe Genetics Facility to confirm the presence of the designed mutations. the viral titer was calculated as the number of PFU per ml. confluent LLC-MK2 cells were infected with wild-type rhMPV or mutant rhMPV at an MOI of 0.01. Membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in PBS and subsequently probed with anti-hMPV N-protein monoclonal antibody (Millipore) diluted 1:200 in PBS-milk, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG monoclonal antibody. each rhMPV mutant was repeatedly passaged 10 times in LLC-MK2 cells. at each passage, CR VI of the L-protein gene was amplified by RT-PCR and sequenced. at day 3 postinfection, total RNA was isolated from virus-infected cells. 3H incorporation was normalized to the level of viral mRNA quantified by real-time RT-PCR. trans-ribose 2\u2032-O methylation assay was performed by incubating 500 ng of mRNA with 10 units of vaccinia virus 2\u2032-O MTase supplied by a vaccinia virus 2\u2032-O MTase kit. reactions were performed in the presence of 1 mM ATP; 0.5 mM CTP, GTP, and UTP; 1 mM SAM; and 25% (vol/vol) rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) after incubation at 30\u00b0C for 5 h, RNA was purified with an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen) cotton rats in group 1 were inoculated with 2.0 105 PFU of wild-type rhMPV. cotton rats in group 6 were mock infected with 0.1 ml of Opti-MEM medium. each cotton rat was inoculated intranasally with a volume of 100 l. cotton rats in groups 2 to 7 were challenged intranasally with wild-type rhMPV at a dose of 1.0 106 PFU per cotton rat. at day 4 postchallenge, all cotton rats from each group were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation. the lungs and nasal turbinates from each cotton rat were collected for virus isolation and histological evaluation. the right lung of each animal was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. five-micrometer sections were cut and placed onto positively charged slides. slides were further incubated with ABC Elite complex to probe biotin. the mixtures were transferred to confluent Vero E6 cells in a 96-well plate in triplicate. after 1 h of incubation, the cells were overlaid with 0.75% methylcellulose in DMEM and incubated for another 4 days before virus plaque titration. plaques were counted, and 50% plaque reduction titers were calculated as the hMPV-specific neutralizing antibody titers. a phosphorimager (Typhoon; GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) and ImageQuant TL software (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) was performed by one-way multiple comparisons using SPSS (version 8.0) statistical analysis software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). RESULTS Sequence analysis of the putative MTase domain in hMPV L protein. amino acid sequence alignments suggest residues K1673, D1779, K1817, and E1848 of the hMPV L protein correspond to the catalytic K-D-K-E tetrad. methylation reactions, a G-rich motif and an acidic residue (D) are involved in binding the methyl donor SAM. pCITE-L carrying any of the mutations in the predicted MTase catalytic and SAM binding sites decreased GFP expression. this result suggests that the amino acids predicted to be important in MTase catalytic and SAM binding sites were critical because the mutations conferred a defect in replication, gene expression, or both. all rhMPV mutants were positive for viral N-protein expression in the immunostaining assay using a monoclonal antibody against N protein. however, the immunospots formed by these rhMPV mutants in LLC-MK2 cells were much smaller than those formed by wild-type rhMPV. a direct agarose overlay plaque assay was performed in LLC-MK2 cells. LLC-MK2 cells were infected with recombinant hMPV mutants. at day 4 postinfection, the supernatant was removed and the cells were fixed. at day 4 postinfection, the cells were labeled with an anti-hMPV N-protein primary monoclonal antibody. the peak viral titer of the hMPV G1755A mutant was 4.6 log10 PFU/ml. this was 1.4 log units lower than that of wild-type rhMPV. rhMPVs carrying mutations in the SAM binding site had a delay in viral replication and were attenuated in cell culture. LLC-MK2 cells in 35-mm dishes were infected with each recombinant hMPV at an MOI of 0.01. after adsorption for 1 h, the inocula were removed and the infected cells were washed 3 times with Opti-MEM medium. fresh Opti-MEM medium was added and the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for various times. 1755A mutants showed moderate (10 to 30%) reductions in N-protein expression compared to wild-type rhMPV at days 1 and 3 postinfection. the level of N protein in wild-type rhMPV-infected cells decreased at days 5 and 7 postinfection. the ratio between mRNA and genomic RNA was calculated for each recombinant hMPV. we also determined viral genomic RNA replication and mRNA synthesis for each recombinant virus. genomic RNA for each mutant was not significantly altered from that for wild-type rhMPV. rhMPV mutants were passaged 10 times in LLC-MK2 cells. the region containing the respective mutation in the virus from each passage was sequenced. rhMPV mRNAs were not methylated by vaccinia virus G-N-7 MTase. the level of [3H]SAM incorporation of mRNAs was indistinguishable from that of mRNA produced by wild-type rhMPV. this indicates that the rhMPV mutants are not defective in G-N-7 methylation. five hundred nanograms of mRNA was isolated from virus-infected cells. the RNAs were purified and further trans-methylated by vaccinia virus 2\u2032-O MTase in the presence of 15 Ci [3H]SAM. the averages of four independent experiments are shown. rhMPV mRNAs were not methylated by vaccinia virus 2\u2032-O MTase. the level of 3H incorporation of the mutants was 3.5- to 4-fold higher than that of wild-type rhMPV (P 0.05), suggesting that the rhMPV G1696A, G1700A, and D1755A mutants had defects in 2\u2032-O methylation. this suggests that rhMPVs carrying mutation the rVSV G1674A mutant is fully methylated at G-N-7 and 2\u2032-O at high (1 mM) SAM concentrations. the rVSV D1735A mutant inhibits both G-N-7 and 2\u2032-O methylations by approximately 70%. mRNAs of the rVSV K1651A, G1670A, and D1735A mutants were efficiently methylated by vaccinia virus G-N-7 MTa the level of 3H incorporation of the rVSV K1651A and rVSV G1670A mutants was approximately 5.5- and 3.0-fold higher than that of wild-type rVSV. this is consistent with our previous results showing that the rVSV K1651A mutant completely lacked both G-N-7 and 2\u2032-O methylations. the rVSV G1670A mutant lacked G-N-7 methylation but not 2\u2032- all MTase-defective rhMPVs had reduced viral replication in the nasal turbinate and lung. for the rhMPV G1700A mutant, 4 out of 5 cotton rats had detectable virus in the nasal turbinate. only 1 out of 5 rats had detectable virus in lung tissue. cotton rats were inoculated intranasally with DMEM or 2 105 PFU of wild-type rhMPV. at day 4 postimmunization, animals were euthanized for pathology study. virus-infected cotton rats had detectable viral genomic RNA in their tissues, even though they were negative for infectious virus. the viral RNA level was significantly reduced in the upper and lower respiratory tracts of all animals infected with the MTase-defective rhMPVs. all MTase-defective rhMPVs had significant defects in viral genome replication in cotton rats. the rhMPV G1700A mutant caused mononuclear inflammation similar to that caused by wild-type rhMPV but caused significantly fewer pulmonary histopathological changes. no pathological changes were found in the lungs of cotton rats inoculated with DMEM. fewer viral antigen-positive cells were detected in the bronchial epithelial cells of the rhMPV G1700A mutant-infected group. no or little viral antigen was detected in lung tissues from the groups infected with the rhMPV G1696A and D1755A mutants. mrs rhMPVs had significant defects in viral replication and antigen expression in the lower respiratory tract. at week 4 postinoculation, animals were challenged with 106 PFU of rhMPV. at day 4 postinoculation, all the animals were sacrificed and nasal turbinate samples were collected for virus detection and pathological examination. unvaccinated controls had average titers of 5.59 0.49 and 4.76 0.29 log10 PFU/g in the nasal turbinate and lung. infection with the rhMPV G1696A, G1700A, and rhMPV mutants provided complete protection from challenge with wild-type rhMPV. animals were challenged with 106 PFU of wild-type rhMPV. c The viral RNA titer was determined by real-time RT-PCR. the severity of lung histology was scored for each group. the right lung from each cotton rat was preserved in 4% (vol/vol) phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde. fixed tissues were embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5 m, and stained with H&E for the examination of histological changes by light microscopy. mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (32), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (43) found that the mechanism of attenuation of the 2\u2032-O MTase-defective viruses is attributable to enhanced sensitivity to the antiviral action of IFN. however, whether this mechanism is conserved in nonsegmented negative-sense RNA viruses (such as hMPV) is not known. confluent vero E6 cells in 24-well plates were pretreated with DMEM. cells were then washed three times with DMEM and infected with each rhMPV mutant. after 1 h of adsorption, cells were washed three times with DMEM. ribose 2\u2032-O MTase contains a K-D-K-E tetrad whose residues function as the catalytic residues for methylation. residues K1673, D1779, K1817, and E1848 of the hMPV L protein correspond to the catalytic K-D-K-E tetrad. in methylation reactions, a G-rich motif and an acidic residue (D) are plasmids pCITE-N, pCITE-P, pCITE-M2-1, pCITE-L, or pCITE-L carrying a mutated L protein were observed at 48 h postinfection. no GFP signal was detected when pCITE-L was omitted from the transfection. the amino acids predicted to be important in MTase catalytic and SAM binding sites were critical. recombinant hMPVs carrying mutations in the SAM binding site were mutated to alanine. the amino acids in the predicted GXGXG... D/E motif were individually mutated to alanine in the full-length genomic cDNA of hMPV lineage A strain NL/1/00 (phMPV) a 1.4-kb DNA fragment spanning CR VI of the L gene was amplified by RT-PCR from each rhMPV mutant. however, no DNA band was observed when PCR was performed without the RT step. the entire genomes of these recombinants were sequenced to confirm that no additional mutation(s had been introduced. LLC-MK2 cells were infected with each recombinant virus at an MOI of 0.01. the rhMPV G1696A, G1700A, and D1755A mutants were significantly delayed in viral replication compared to wild-type rhMPV (P 0.05). the peak viral titer of the rhMPV G1696A mutant was 4.6 log10 PFU/ml. onset of the CPE caused by the rhMPV G1696A mutant was delayed by 3 days. that of the CPE caused by the rhMPV G1700A and D1755A mutants was delayed by 1 day. rhMPVs carrying mutations in the SAM binding site had a delay in viral replication and were attenuated in cell culture. recombinant hMPVs carrying mutations in the SAM binding site were defective in gene expression and RNA synthesis. the rhMPV G1700A and D1755A mutants had a significant delay in N-protein synthesis (P 0.05) total RNA was isolated using the TRizol reagent. genomic RNA was quantified by real-time RT-PCR using primers annealing to the hMPV leader sequence and N gene. data are the averages of three independent experiments. 96A, G1700A, and D1755A mutants had 1.1-, 0.5-, and 3.3-fold less N-protein mRNA than wild-type rhMPV. the ratio between mRNA and genomic RNA for each hMPV mutant was not significantly altered from that for wild-type rhMPV. rhMPV mutants were incubated with 10 units of vaccinia virus G-N-7 MTase. equal amounts of mRNA from each mutant were harvested and purified. the level of 3H incorporation of mRNAs was indistinguishable from that of mRNA produced by wild-type rhMPV. the number of corrected counts per minute (CCPM) of [3H]SAM incorporation was subtracted from the CCPM of each hMPV mutant. the number on the top of each column indicates the ratio of [3H]SAM incorporation of viral mRNAs between mutant and wild-type virus. mRNAs were purified and further methylated by 10 units of vaccinia virus 2\u2032-O MTase in the presence of 15 Ci [3H]SAM. after the methylation reaction, the RNA was purified and the level of 2\u2032-O methylation was measured using a scintillation counter. the level of 3H incorporation of the rhMPV mutants was 3.5- to 4-fold higher than that of wild-type r catalytic site abolishes both G-N-7 and 2\u2032-O methylations. rVSV G1670A, rVSV G1674A, and rVSV D1735A mutants. each carries a mutation in the SAM binding site equivalent to the rhMPV G1696A, G1700A, and D1755A mutations. rVSV K1651A and rVSV D1735A mutants lacked G-N-7 methylation and the rVSV D1735A mutant had a 70% deficiency in G-N-7 methylation. the level of 3H incorporation of the rVSV K1651A and D1735A mutants was approximately 5.5- and 3.0-fold higher than that of wild-type rVSV. cotton rats were inoculated with wild-type rhMPV replicated efficiently in the nasal turbinates and lungs of all five cotton rats. average viral titers of 5.24 0.35 log10 PFU/g and 3.02 0.46 log10 PFU/g were found in the nasal turbinate and lung, respectively. all MTase-defective rhMPVs had reduced viral replication in the nasal turbinate and lung. cotton rats were inoculated intranasally with DMEM or 2 105 PFU of wild-type rhMPV or an rhMPV mutant. at day 4 postimmunization, animals were euthanized for pathology study. the viral titer was determined by an immunostaining assay. the average score for each group is shown. 0, no antigen; 1, small amount of antigen; 2, moderate amount of antigen; 3, large amount of antigen. f GRC, genomic RNA copies. g ND, not detected. rhMPV caused moderate pulmonary histopathological changes, including interstitial pneumonia, peribronchial lymphoplasmocytic infiltrates, mononuclear cell infiltrates and edematous thickening of the bronchial submucosa. no pathological changes were found in the lungs of cotton rats inoculated with DMEM. large numbers of viral antigen-positive cells were detected at the luminal surfaces of the bronchial epithelial cells in the lungs of wild-type rhMPV-infected cotton rats. the pattern of viral antigen was discontinuous, and antigen appeared in clusters of adjacent cells. in some cases, luminal cellular debris that may have included both epithelial cell debris and macrophages also stained positive for hMPV antigen. MTase-defective hMPVs were attenuated in vitro and in vivo. cotton rats were inoculated intranasally with the rhMPV mutants. the hMPV-neutralizing antibody titer was determined using a plaque reduction neutralization assay. cotton rats vaccinated with wild-type rhMPV or MTase-defective rhMPVs did not have any detectable infectious virus in either the nasal turbinates or lungs after challenge with rhMPV. unvaccinated challenged controls had average titers of 5.59 0.49 and 4.76 0.29 log10 PFU animals were immunized intranasally with DMEM or 2 105 PFU of wild-type rhMPV or an rhMPV mutant. at day 28 postimmunization, animals were challenged with 106 PFU of wild-type rhMPV. fewer histological changes were found in the lungs of cotton rats vaccinated with wild-type rhMPV and the rhMPV G1696A, G1700A, and D1755A mutants. no enhanced lung damage was observed in the unvaccinated and challenged groups. 2\u2032-O MTase-defective hMPVs are highly sensitive to IFN- and IFN- treatment. recent work on west Nile virus (33), dengue virus (42), mouse hepatitis virus (32), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (43) found that the mechanism of attenuation of the 2\u2032-O MTase-defective viruses is attributable to enhanced sensitivity to the antiviral action of IFN. all 2\u2032-O MTase-defective hMPVs were highly sensitive to both IFN- and IFN- inhibition. wild-type hMPV was not sensitive to IFN inhibition. this result suggests that the mechanism of attenuation of 2\u2032-O defective viruses may also be conserved in hMPV. MTase-defective rhMPVs are a new target for attenuation of hMPV. a live attenuated vaccine is the most promising for human paramyxoviruses. these recombinant viruses were specifically defective in 2\u2032-O methylation but not G-N-7 methylation. the rhMPV G1696A and D1755A mutants were highly attenuated, based on the fact that no infectious virus was found in the upper or lower respiratory tract. cotton rats are the best small-animal model of infection with human paramyxoviruses, including RSV, hMPV, and PIV3 (46\u201348) cotton rats are more permissive to hMPV infection than hamsters and mice, with the titers in cotton rat lungs being up to 5 log10 PFU higher than those in hamster and mouse lungs. MTase-defective hMPVs are highly efficacious in a cotton rat model. rVSVs lacking both G-N-7 and 2\u2032-O methylation were highly attenuated. flaviviruses lacking 2\u2032-O methylation were also attenuated in animal models. mutations to a single MTase active site in CR VI of the VSV L protein abolished both G-N-7 and 2\u2032-O methylations. mutations to a single MTase active site in CR VI of the VSV L protein abolished both G-N-7 and 2\u2032-O methylations. mutations to the SAM binding site in VSV L protein diminished both G-N-7 and 2\u2032-O methylations. mRNA cap methylation is achieved in a sequential order in which the 2\u2032-O methylation precedes and facilitates the G-N-7 methylation (29). however, all known cellular and other viral mRNA caps are first methylated at the G-N-7 position, followed by the 2\u2032-O position (26, 31, 41). we compared the roles of amino acid residues in VSV and hMPV SAM binding sites in methylation. the order of mRNA cap methylation in other paramyxoviruses differs from that in VSV. more recent studies have found that RSV mRNA is G-N-7 methylated at a low SAM concentration but could further be chased to have a doubly methylated cap at higher SAM concentrations. a Lacked G-N-7 but not 2\u2032-O Attenuated Low virulence WT rVSV G1674A Sensitive to SAM concn Not attenuated Virulent NDe rVSV D1735A Diminished G-N-7 and 2\u2032-O Attenuated ND a Attenuation was judged by plaque size, infectivity, and growth curve. the mechanism of attenuation of 2\u2032-O MTase-defective viruses is enhanced sensitivity to the antiviral action of IFN (32, 33) this suggests that the general mechanism of attenuation of virus that lacks 2\u2032-O methylation may be conserved in hMPV and perhaps other NNS RNA viruses. however, it appears that NNS RNA viruses possess many unique characteristics in mRNA cap methylation. a live attenuated vaccine is the most promising vaccine for human paramyxoviruses. a live attenuated vaccine is the most promising for human paramyxoviruses. a live attenuated vaccine can serve as a new target for attenuation of hMPV. recombinant viruses were specifically defective in 2\u2032-O methylation but not G-N-7 methylation. these recombinant viruses produced smaller plaques and had delayed growth kinetics, lower peak titers, and less protein synthesis in cell culture than wild-type rhMPV. all MTase-defective rhMPVs induced significantly fewer lung histopathological changes. cotton rats are the best small-animal model of infection with human paramyxoviruses, including RSV, hMPV, and PIV3 (46\u201348) cotton rats are more permissive to hMPV infection than hamsters and mice, with the titers in cotton rat lungs being up to 5 log10 PFU higher than those in hamster and mouse lungs. MTase-defective hMPVs are highly efficacious in a cotton rat model. rVSVs lacking both G-N-7 and 2\u2032-O methylation were highly attenuated. flaviviruses lacking 2\u2032-O methylation were also attenuated in animal models. recombinant viruses specifically defective in G-N-7 and/or ribose 2\u2032-O can be generated. the MTase domain is highly conserved in L proteins of all NNS RNA viruses, with exception of those in the family Bornaviridae (39, 40). this novel attenuation strategy can be employed for other viruses. site in VSV L protein diminished both G-N-7 and 2\u2032-O methylation for some mutations or specifically diminished G-N-7 methylation but not 2\u2032-O methylation for other mutations. mRNA cap methylation is achieved in a sequential order in which the 2\u2032-O methylation precedes and facilitates the G-N-7 methylation (29). mRNA caps are first methylated at the G-N-7 position, followed by the 2\u2032-O mRNA cap methylation precedes 2\u2032-O methylation by a single peptide at the N terminus of the NS protein (56\u201358). more recent studies have found that RSV mRNA is G-N-7 methylated at a low SAM concentration but could further be chased to have a doubly methylated cap at higher SAM concentrations. virulent NDe rVSV G1670A Lacked G-N-7 but not 2\u2032-O Attenuated Low virulence WT rVSV G1674A Sensitive to SAM concn Not attenuated Virulent NDe rVSV D1735A Diminished G-N-7 and 2\u2032-O Attenuated ND a Attenuation was judged by plaque size, infectivity, and growth curve the mechanism of attenuation of 2\u2032-O MTase-defective viruses is enhanced sensitivity to the antiviral action of IFN (32, 33, 64). this suggests that the general mechanism of attenuation of virus that lacks 2\u2032-O methylation may be conserved in hMPV and perhaps other NNS RNA viruses. this novel vaccine strategy can be used with other human paramyxoviruses."}
