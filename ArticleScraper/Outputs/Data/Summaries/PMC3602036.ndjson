DN1, JAK2, HEXB, ATP2A2, HMOX1, HERPUD1 and HERPUD1 with the first 28 genes (50.91%) clustered in A, B and C, respectively. the last 15 genes (27.27%) in H and I clusters, respectively. LR2I, TBC1D1, BCKDK, SLC16A3, BNIP3, LGALS9, PLA2G2D, CCL2, SDS and IDO1 were identified as the most active down- and up-regulated genes. there were 30 pathways in organismal systems of PAMs infected with PRRSV at 24 hours post infection that had 20 or more DE genes. interferon / signaling, IFN signaling, interleukin signaling, intestinal immune network for IgA production, ISG15 antiviral mechanism, L1CAM interactions. regulation of leukocyte activation, leukocyte adhesion, leukocyte chemotaxis, leukocyte mediated immunity and regulation. PRRSV infection of PAMs caused DE of 234 genes that share pathways associated with human diseases, such as cancers, cardiovascular diseases, endocrine and metabolic diseases, infectious diseases and neurodegenerative diseases. most genes had exclusive functions in each disease subcategory. KEGG and REACTOME pathway analyses revealed 36, 19 and 18 genes that are related to human cancer diseases, endocrine and metabolic diseases and cardiovascular diseases. more than two-thirds of genes associated with leishmaniasis (91%), toxoplasmosis (86%), HTLV-I infection (73%), tuberculosis (73%) and herpes simplex infection (71%) were down-regulated in PAMs infected with PRRSV. DE genes were involved in at least 10 human disease pathways. included MAPK1, TLR4, IL1B, HLA-DMB, RAF1, JUN, ACTB, TNF, HLA-DRA, HLA-DRA, HLA-DQA2, HLA-DQB1, NFKBIA, ITGB1, IL1A, NFKB1, HLA-DQA1 and ACTG1 with the last 17 (89%) clustered in H, I and our transcriptome profiling represents the largest known set of DE genes of PAMs challenged with PRRSV. only 8 of 108 (7.4%), 50 of 215 (23%) and 47 of 294 (16%) known coding genes previously reported were also DE in PRRSV-infected PAMs. infected groups were challenged with PRRSV-WUH3 by intramuscular inoculation. the infected groups were challenged with PRRSV-WUH3 by intramuscular inoculation. these investigations examined responses to infections with different PRRSV strains. the DAVID Bioinformatics database is owned by the NIH. the team developed a single linkage method by which >20 gene identifier types and >40 functional annotation categories have been comprehensively integrated. the KEGG database is described as a resource for understanding high-level functions and utilities of biological systems. the category with the greatest number of DE genes in each of these six systems belongs to the cell growth and death with 191 DE genes identified in cellular processes. the transcription processes with 147 DE genes in the genetic information processing, signal transductions with 126 DE genes in the environmental information processing, energy metabolism with 176 DE genes in metabolism. the immune system with 297 DE genes in organismal systems, infectious diseases in human disease. PRRSV infection under certain circumstances fails to elicit some components of the innate response. Adaptive immunity depends on antigen presentation, where the MHC (major histocompatibility complex) class II molecule binds antigen to trigger an appropriate adaptive immune response and restrict pathogen growth. protein folding (78%) and protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum (75%) in the genetic information processing systems. signaling by MAPK (85%), NGF (70%) and GPCR (67%), GPCR ligand binding (67%) and positive regulation of signal transduction (65%) in the environmental information processing systems. dominant pathways with two-thirds of DE genes up-regulated in PAMs infected with PRRSV at 24 h post infection. the abundance of DE genes in cluster A increased from initial infection until 16 h post-infection. thereafter, gene abundances decreased, but remained up-regulated at 24 h post infection. the relative abundances of DE genes decreased to their lowest levels at 6 h. more than half of the multi-functional DE genes (17/30 = 57% for the former system and 40/70 = 57% for the latter system) had five point expression patterns clustered in H, I and J. about half of the exclusively expressed DE genes (12/24 = 50% for the former system and 15/31 = 48% for the latter system) were grouped in clusters A, B and C. kines and chemokines (IL1RN and CCRL1) were also down-regulated. complement system activation seemed to be blocked during PRRSV infection. heat stress proteins interact with viral proteins. only 130 DE genes were up-regulated at all four infected time stages. genes involved in regulation of apoptosis and cell death (MAEA, BNIP3, IDO1, GPX1, EI24, and TIAL1) and oxygen metabolism (ACE, VEGFA, BNIP3 and EGLN2) were up-regulated. genes in the DUSP family (DUSP1, DUSP2, DUSP5 and DUSP6) were down-regulated at four times post-infection. at 24 h post infection, an increasing amount of protein is needed to assemble whole virions. antiviral genes (IFI6, IFIT3 and IFITM3) also up-regulated. the abundances of IL1, IL6 and TNF were 10\u2013100 times less in PRRSV single inoculated pigs than PRRSV-LPS inoculated pigs. the complement pathway supports phagocytosis through opsonization and subsequent elimination of pathogens. PRRSV is thought to suppress type I IFN expression and block its signaling by interfering with STAT1/STAT2 nuclear translocation. the virus was also found to inhibit the dsRNA-mediated up-regulation of IFN- gene transcription. pre-treatment of PAMs with PRRSV down-regulated expression of CD163. a PRRSV receptor involved in PRRSV uncoating was significantly decreased after PRRSV infection. the major reactomes of PAMs responding to PRRSV infection included cell growth and death, transcription processes, signal transductions, energy metabolism, infectious diseases. PRRSV took control of PAMs in the course of a 24 hour infection. but the host started to fight back using its autophagy mechanisms. the animal use protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. the SAGE libraries provided the population means of the transcript abundance levels for each time point. the clones were amplified and sequenced using a high-throughput sequencing pipeline with an ABI 3730 automated sequencer. in the present study, we used both criteria, (8) and (10), to identify differentially expressed (DE) SAGE tags. a total of 52,121 mRNA sequences were collected from 52,121 mRNA sequences. 95 mRNA sequences had the same AAAAAAAAAAAA tag and were deleted from the analysis. each DE gene had at least one time point (6 h, 12 h, 16 h, and 24 h respectively) that was at least a 2 fold change and 100 tags per million (TPM) different from the 0 h mock-infected control. each gene should average 100 TPM when a million SAGE tags are sequenced. training builds the map using input examples (data) and mapping automatically classifies a new input vector. the weights of the BMU and neurons close to it in the SOM are adjusted towards the input vector. primary PAMs were isolated, cultured, and infected, as previously described. cells were infected with PRRSV strain VR-2332. clones were amplified and sequenced using a high-throughput sequencing pipeline. we assumed a conjugate Gamma prior distribution, Gamma (a, b), for the parameter, then, the posterior distribution of is also a Gamma density with parameters and, (3) Now, we considered and are counts of the i th SAGE tag at two time points, and, respectively, are the total numbers of SAGE tags measured at these two time points. a total of 52,121 mRNA sequences were collected from 52,121 mRNA sequences. 95 mRNA sequences had the same AAAAAAAAAA tag and were subsequently deleted from the analysis. mRNA sequences were then annotated for orthologs in the human genome. each gene should average 100 TPM when a million SAGE tags are sequenced. the associated pathways of all DE genes were identified using the self-organizing map (SOM) as described previously [65]. the neighborhood function (v, t) depends on the distance between the BMU and neuron v. at the beginning when the neighborhood has shrunk to just a couple of neurons the weights are converging to local estimates."}
