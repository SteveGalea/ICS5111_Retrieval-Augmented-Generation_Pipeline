{"summary": "microRNAs (miRNAs) are small molecules made of 21 nucleotides. they modulate several biological processes through post-transcriptional gene expression regulation. some miRNA knockout strains have altered susceptibility to fungal or bacterial infections. kr\u00fctzfeldt et al. conducted a study on mice in order to study the biological significance of miR-122, which is abundant in the liver. researchers found that cholesterol biosynthesis genes would have been modulated by miR-122; in fact, plasma cholesterol levels were reduced in antagomiR-122-treated mice. a genome-wide associated study has identified new mechanisms supporting the role of cigarette smoke-induced miR-21 expression in the amplification of inflammatory responses and in tumorigenesis processes within the airways. many authors investigated miRNA expression in COPD, noticing that wide networks composed of miRNA and messenger RNA cooperate in COPD pathogenesis. new research shows miRNAs may play a crucial role in vascular remodeling, thus inhibiting or promoting pulmonary vascular resistance. acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute lung injury (ALI) are well defined clinical disorders caused by many clinical insults to the lung or because of predisposition to lung injury. two clinical studies have been launched for hepatitis C virus infection and advanced hepatocellular carcinoma [22,23] treatment. no clinical trials have yet evaluated the impact on respiratory diseases of miRNA-targeted strategies. results According to the procedure previously described, we retrieved 68 articles matching the inclusion criteria. the vast majority included research carried out on cell lines and on animals. the condition most widely investigated was lung cancer (21/68) and pulmonary hypertension (7/68). miRNAs often involved in lung conditions include miR-7 and miR-34, included in four articles, and miR-92 and miR-374, with three hits each. despite a handful of miRNAs with multiple hits across the works included in our research, the only critical issue eventually identified for our approach concerns the right choice for the miRNA to be downregulated. cell lines KYSE150, KYSE410, KYSE70, EC109, and EC9706. cell lines injected with EC9706/miR-17-92 and EC9706/Control cells miR-19a Antagomir-19a treatment impairs tumor growth in vivo. n = 22; normal ovarian samples (n = 10); peripheral blood mononuclear cells (n = 10) miR-7, miR-132, miR-335, and miR-148a. human cell line A549 miR-144-3p miR-144-3p antagomir could enhance proliferation of IL-1 (p 0.001) whole blood samples from patients with NSCLC and controls. tumor and nontumorous tissues obtained from NSCLC patients (n = 20) 9706/miR-17-92 and EC9706/Control cells miR-19a Antagomir-19a treatment impairs tumor growth in vivo (p 0.05) Lin et al.

[78]. all antagomiRs employed successfully reduced pathological changes, starting from cellular level, in vivo, without evidence of inefficacy on the samples studied. the results obtained confirmed the good reliability and efficacy of antagomiRs in improving the biomarkers of diseases in vitro. antagomiR-374a was used in more than one study [80,81], on lung injury and lung inflammation, respectively. humans Four studies were performed on humans, one about lung cell dysfunction, lung fibrosis, HIV infection and substance abuse, and tuberculosis. in all four cases, an improvement of the outcome was found in vivo, independently from the condition studied. cell lines Nineteen studies were included in this category, most of which were already mentioned in the two previous (humans and animals) groups. three of them were performed on influenza [86,88,90] and three others on lung fibrosis [26,82,84]. other conditions were more rarely studied. animals Sixteen studies on animals were found for this macro-category. the condition more largely studied was influenza (four studies) miR-155 was successfully tailored in two studies. the other antagomiRs were also seen to be efficient in positively tailoring the activity of the respective miRNAs, thus improving the biological outcome of the various conditions they were applied to. miR-21 seems to be the most represented miRNA among lung conditions. inflammatory lesions and airway hyper-responsiveness were measured. Ischemia/reperfusion injury is the primary cause of acute lung injury (ALI) and primary graft dysfunction (PGD) after lung transplantation. miR-21 was highly expressed by myofibroblasts in the fibrotic lungs. miR-21 reduced bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in rats\u2019 lungs. another miRNA molecule is miR-155. a family of immunoglobulin cell surface receptors expressed on myeloid cells (TREM) proteins are considered amplifiers of toll-like receptor (TLR)-induced inflammation. experiments with antagomiR-155 confirmed that TREM-1-mediated changes were dependent on miR-155. researchers inhibited TREM-1 using a nanomicellar strategy. antagomiR-155 down-regulates miR-155 expression suppressing IL-8 and other proinflammatory genes in CF cells. antagomiRs are chemically modified oligonucleotides that are used to silence microRNAs. antagomiRs are chemically modified oligonucleotides able of silencing microRNAs. they are now emerging as novel therapeutic agents in several conditions. findings provide new knowledge on the network of miRNAs in lung diseases."}
