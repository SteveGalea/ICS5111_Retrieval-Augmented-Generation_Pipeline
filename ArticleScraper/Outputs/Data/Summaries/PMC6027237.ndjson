{"summary": "influenza vaccines are the most widely used vaccines in the world, with over 500 million doses used annually [1], due to seasonal epidemics and the recommendation of annual vaccination. the efficacy of the inactivated influenza vaccine (LAIV) is moderate to poor, and is impacted by antigenic drift [2], mismatch [3,4], pandemic emergence due to reassortment [5], and egg adaptation during vaccine production [6]. current vaccine stockpiles for avian influenza viruses current inactivated influenza vaccines tend to prevent induction of cross-reactive CD8+ T-cells. effective heterologous immunity against zoonotic influenza (H7N9) viruses requires synergy of multiple immune arms for heterologous protection. cross-presentation derived peptides generated by the cleavage of viral proteins by the immunoproteasome. this process has important implications for vaccine approaches that need to consider the design and delivery of antigen to these pathways for the activation of T cells. the majority of T cell epitopes are derived from internal proteins. HA and NA surface proteins are only 40\u201370% conserved between different IAV subtypes. a conserved CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitope in the PB1 protein can elicit cross-reactive CD4+ T cells in humans. helper CD4+ T cells recognize viral peptides within MHC class II. MHCII is expressed by professional antigen presenting cells, B cells, macrophages, dendritic cells. the capacity for heterologous immunity by T cell responses is imperative for protection against possible pathogens encountered in a lifetime. heterologous T cell protection to different epitopes has been reported in mice between LCMV, vaccinia virus, and Pichinde virus [39] and in humans between influenza and hepatitis C virus [40]. the number of nave epitope-specific CD8+ T cells has been estimated in the mouse model for immunodominant and subdominant epitopes. the efficiency of recruitment from the nave pool of T cells to respond during acute infection is dependent on numerous factors. the rapid expansion and peak magnitude of virus-specific T cells coincide with drastic reduction in viral titres from days 5\u20139 of primary virus infection, whereas influenza-specific antibodies peak and plateau from days 14\u201320 post infection. multiple doses of LAIVs\u2014and not IIVs or subunit influenza vaccines\u2014can induce long-lived, broad, protective immune responses in mice [53,54,55] therefore, LAIV appears to be more immunogenic in animal studies. but human responses against LAIV are disparate depending on age. heterologous protection mediated by cross-reactive CD8+ T cells was shown to be dependent on an interaction with macrophages and FcR-dependent non-neutralizing antibodies. further cell types also contribute to heterologous protection, such as mucosal associated invariant T (MAIT) cells. type CD4+ T cells can secrete IFN- and are necessary for the formation of CD8+ T cell memory capable of recall. induction of HA-stem-specific antibodies requires highly developed B-cell receptor sequences that have undergone affinity maturation. induction of HA-stem-specific antibodies requires highly developed B-cell receptor sequences that have undergone affinity maturation. a transgenic mouse model identified that depletion of memory CD4+ T cells but not the CD8+ T cell compartment removed heterologous protection from lethal influenza challenges. the role of imprinting CD4+ T cell memory responses by universal vaccines will have an important implication in future vaccine design, and is not yet fully explored. clinical disease and epidemiology is also distinct between seasonal and avian influenza cases. symptoms have either been self-reported [93,94,95], observed [49], or clinically determined [96,97,98]. earliest direct evidence that CD8+ T cells can mediate protection by facilitating virus clearance after infection was shown in a human challenge study. studies to date have been observational, and were based on a relatively small number of cases [30,100] during the H7N9 outbreak in 2013. the early induction and recruitment of memory CD8+ T cells was associated with improved prognosis [30,100] there have been numerous studies investigating cytokine profiles in infected humans. cytokines associated with cellular innate immunity appear to be better predictors of influenza disease severity. most studies of T cell responses in humans have been conducted within the peripheral compartment due to the ease of sample access. viral replication can persist in the lower respiratory tract without detection in the upper respiratory tract. some efforts have been made to quantitatively identify the T cell-mediated protective threshold as the \u201ccorrelate of protection\u201d. some efforts have been made to quantitatively identify the protective threshold as the \u201ccorrelate of protection\u201d because most adults have some baseline level of detectable influenza-specific T cells. each 10-fold increase in the IFN-+IL-2 CD8+ T cell frequency (enumerated by ELISPOT) is associated with a 7-fold reduction in the risk of developing febrile influenza. this has provoked the recent reassessment of variables important for the successful generation of T cell-mediated immunity. non-lymphoid tissues house a large proportion of the memory T cell pool. the majority of the cells present within the tissue are in fact resident. both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell lineages can form Trm. influenza-specific pulmonary Trm are a core component of the natural heterosubtypic immunity developed following exposure to influenza virus. the early stages of infection provide the ideal window of opportunity for effective immune responses to limit disease progression. Iwasaki and colleagues coined this vaccination regime \u201cprime-pull\u201d in 2012. the approach relies on two steps: conventional parenteral vaccination to elicit systemic T cell responses (prime), followed by the topical application of inflammatory agents to lure (pull) the cells into the tissue where they could differentiate into Trm [138] delivery of non-replicative influenza virus [143] or (iii) intranasal immunization with monoclonal antibodies linked to influenza antigens that target antigen to respiratory dendritic cells [131] were all able to successfully generate lung CD8+ Trm that were highly protective against influenza virus challenge. this protection is transient; unlike populations in the skin and intestinal mucosa, Trm cells in the lung undergo attrition [124] as a result of increased influenza-specific Trm are effective at limiting local replication of influenza virus and can block the transmission of influenza virus from the upper respiratory tract to the lung. these cells have the potential to provide long-term immunity against influenza virus. influenza vaccines designed to impart heterosubtypic immunity should evoke this memory T cell subset. there is potential for vast diversity in the epitopes presented for recognition during infection. responses to different epitopes often arrange into reproducible immunodominance hierarchies. the relative size of a given epitope-specific T cell response reflects a complex interplay of virus and host factors. strong representation of these \u201cprotective\u201d HLA alleles in a population is therefore predictive of universal memory T cell responses with the potential to protect against multiple circulating and novel influenza A virus strains. the extent of this universal immunity shows an expected ethnic bias, with higher coverage anticipated in Caucasian populations. carriage of HLA-A*24 alleles or the HLA-A*68:01 alleles correlated with low influenza-specific T cell responses in pH1N1-infected patients. these \u201crisk\u201d HLA alleles may serve as useful markers to identify individuals or populations that are more likely to have low magnitude and less cross-reactive memory T cell responses. higher influenza virus infection rates in Indigenous populations may be related to crowded living conditions, increased rates of chronic disease (lung, heart, and metabolic) and co-morbidities that exacerbate the severity of infection. severity of influenza disease and prolonged hospitalisation periods observed for Indigenous people may therefore reflect a lack of pre-existing protective CD8+ T cell immunity that promotes rapid recovery. determining extent and quality of CD8+ T cell immunity in Indigenous Australians and other Indigenous populations worldwide will require the identification of prominent T cell targets. targeting responses to a few prominent HLAs in Indigenous Australians could achieve high levels of population coverage [153] but may necessitate a tailored vaccine, as many of these HLA alleles occur rarely in other ethnicities. focusing on the largest immunodominant T cell responses may not be all-important. increasing the breadth of the antiviral response by targeting subdominant epitopes may also reduce the potential for mutational escape in immunodominant epitopes. an ideal influenza T cell-based vaccine would induce an overall robust response. it would encompass the importance of HLA coverage even for minor ethnicities with rare HLA types. it would leverage our knowledge of key epitopes and cross-reactive T cell responses. influenza escape can occur very early after the infection of an individual mouse. mutations at anchor sites and TCR contacts for CD8+ T cell influenza epitopes were readily identified, and reverted in the absence of epitope-specific immune pressure. evasion occurring for selected peptides resulting in the need for priming multiple T cell sets for the coverage of diverse NP418\u2013426 variants. pre-emptive priming of T cell subsets to common escape variants could circumvent immune escape. a tailored mosaic peptide vaccine might be the best way to circumvent influenza virus escape, but on a population level for vaccine rollout would be impractical. little is known about CD4+ epitope variation during influenza infection due to a paucity of defined epitopes. data also lacking on individual human viral quasi-species generated during infection. only one example of sequencing of T cell peptides from a longitudinal infected paediatric patient-derived viral RNA [180] non-replicating vectors can be used in immunocompromised and elderly. non-replicating vectors can also be used, and are safe in everyone. considerations for the design of a universal T cell vaccine of the future. pre-emptively prime T cell subsets to common escape variants at a young age. - Combine with other immune mechanisms such as induction of stem antibodies to reduce immune pressure on T cell epitopes. - Establish local immunity at the site of infection Seeding durable, effective Trm memory populations in the lung and upper respiratory tract. promising results have been reported for the MVA+NP/M1 vaccine. HA minus signal peptide vaccine shows reduced transmission time and peak viral loads from vaccinated ferrets to nave ferrets. only 13% of pandemic potential vaccines in clinical development capable of inducing robust T cell responses. this relationship may be exploited in the context of CD4+ T cell imprinting. the vaccination of ferrets with MF59 or AS03-adjuvanted, inactivated H5N1 vaccines elicited a stronger CD8+ T cell response upon virus challenge. however, these adjuvants\u2019 effects on the CD8+ T cell populations in humans is limited. review has highlighted some under-appreciated aspects of influenza-specific T cell immunity for consideration in the design of a universal vaccine of the future. this includes some caveats, such as the potential short half-life of T cell resident memory, T cell immune escape, and the impact of antigen presentation timing for immunodominance hierarchies. further research is needed in the field to identify their protective capacity and the optimal vaccine design for safe delivery. the field is in its relative infancy compared to antibody-based vaccines. a quantum leap will be needed in adapting vaccine production, safety and efficacy trials."}
