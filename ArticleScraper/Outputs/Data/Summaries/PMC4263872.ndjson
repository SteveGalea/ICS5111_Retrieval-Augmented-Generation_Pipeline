{"summary": "the progression and severity of the symptoms observed in MERS patients resemble the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) observed in patients infected with SARS-CoV, which caused a global pandemic in 2003. dromedary camels are suspected to be one of the direct reservoirs for the transmission of MERS-CoV. coVs employ either one or two papain-like proteases (PLpros) to release nsp1, nsp2, and nsp3 and a chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) that cleaves all junctions downstream of nsp4. the PLpro domain has recently been confirmed to recognize and cleave after the sequence LXGG at the nsp12 and nsp23 junctions. the C terminus of Ub can be recognized by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) which catalyze the deconjugation of Ub, thus reversing the effects of ubiquitination. coV PLpros, including those of MERS- and SARS-CoV, have been suggested to act as multifunctional proteases that cleave the viral polyproteins at internal LXGG cleavage sites. cellular DUBs function to prevent excessive inflammation and immune responses during infection by removal of Ub from innate immune factors. previous work has shown that during infection, SARS-CoV indeed suppresses the host's antiviral responses by preventing the induction of IFN- expression. mutations were introduced that selectively disrupted Ub recognition by targeting regions of the Ub-binding site on PLpro. using this approach, we removed the DUB activity from PLpro without affecting its ability to cleave the nsp34 cleavage site in trans. this enabled us, for the first time, to demonstrate that the DUB activity of MERS-CoV PLpro can suppress the MAVS-mediated induction of IFN- expression. pASK3 (31), pcDNA-eGFP (30), pCMV-FLAG-Ub (32), pLuc-IFN- (33), pEBG-RIG-I(2CARD) (34), pEBG-RIG-I(2CARD) (34), pEBG-RIG-I(2CARD) (34), pEBG-RIG-I(2CARD) (34), pEBG pCAGGS-HA-nsp3-4-V5 (amino acids 854\u20133246), pCAGGS-HA-nsp3C-4-V5 (amino acids 1820\u20133246), and pCAGGS-HA-nsp3-Myc (amino acids 854\u20133246, which does not include the PLpro domain) sequence encoding MERS-CoV PLpro (amino acids 1479\u2013180 cells transformed with pASK-MERS-CoV-PLpro were cultured to an A600 of 0.6 in lysogeny broth at 37 \u00b0C. protein expression was then induced with 200 ng/ml anhydrotetracycline for 16 h at 20 \u00b0C. lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 g for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C.

Eluted protein was dialyzed against storage buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 50% (v/v) glycerol, and 250 mm imidazole) to achieve removal of the Ub from mutated and/or inactive PLpro. expression and Purification of MERS-CoV PLpro for Crystallization E. coli BL21(DE3) GOLD cells harboring pE-SUMO-PLpro were grown at 37 \u00b0C with aeration in 500 ml of lysogeny broth containing kanamycin (35 g/ml) to an A600 of 0.6\u20130.8. cell pellets were resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (150 mm Tag-free PLpro was separated from his6-SUMO and the His6-Ulp1 SUMO protease by passing the dialyzed protein mix through a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid gravity column. the flow-through contained purified PLpro that was subsequently dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT and further purified by gel filtration using a superdex 75 single crystals of open PLproUb from condition 2 above were cryoprotected in 1.85 m AmSO4, 15% glycerol and 22% PEG 4000, 0.1 m trisodium citrate, pH 5.6, 10% 1,2-propanediol, respectively, before flash cooling in liquid nitrogen. initial phase estimates for reflections collected from unliganded PLpro were determined via a single wavelength anomalous dispersion experiment. initial models were constructed using phenix.autobuild. further model building and refinement were carried out using phenix.refine. crystallographic statistics for all structures are found in Table 1. plasmids encoding FLAG-tagged Ub (0.25 g), GFP (0.25 g), and MERS-CoV-PLpro-V5 (0.15 g) were co-transfected to assess the in trans cleavage activity of MERS-CoV PLpro. 80% confluent HEK293T cells in 24-well plates were transfected with 5 ng of plasmid pRL-TK (Promega) encoding Renilla luciferase; IFN--Luc firefly reporter plasmid (25 ng); innate immune response inducer plasmids encoding RIG-I(2CARD), MAVS, or IRF3(5D) 4 LSB was added to the remaining lysates, and these samples were analyzed by Western blotting. primary antibodies were mouse anti-HA (ab18181; Abcam), mouse anti-V5 (37-7500; Invitrogen), mouse anti-actin (A5316; Sigma-Aldrich), rabbit anti-GFP (30). pp1a/pp1ab amino acid numbering is used throughout this work. the sequence encoding amino acids 1480\u20131803 of MERS-CoV pp1a/pp1ab was PCR-amplified, cloned downstream of the T7 promoter of expression vector pE-SUMO (LifeSensors) pCAGGS-HA-nsp3C-4-V5 (amino acids 1820\u20133246, which does not include the PLpro domain), and pCAGGS-HA-nsp3-Myc (amino acids 854\u20132739) the sequence encoding MERS-CoV PLpro (amino acids 1479\u20131803) was PCR-amplified using synthetic plasmid DNA as a template and cloned in the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 g for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C. the beads were washed four times with wash buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 200 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 20 mm imidazole), followed by the elution of the protein with elution buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 200 mm NaCl, 10% ase T (Boston Biochem) served as a positive control. after a 2-h incubation, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 4 Laemmli sample buffer (4 LSB; 500 mm Tris, 4% SDS, 40% glycerol, 0.02% bromphenol blue. the column was washed with 10 column volumes of lysis buffer supplemented with 25 mm imidazole, followed by elution of the fusion protein with 250 mm imidazole. the resulting PLproUb complex was dialyzed into 20 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT. crystallization of PLpro and PLproUb Complexes was concentrated and crystallized at 20 \u00b0C in two different conditions using the vapor diffusion method. one m DTT was added to the protein to a final concentration of 5 mm, which was found to improve crystallization. X-ray diffraction data were collected from all crystals at the Zn-K absorption edge at beamline 08B1-1 of the Canadian Light Source and integrated using XDS (40). Integrated data were then scaled using Scala (41). initial phase estimates for reflections collected from unliganded and Ub-bound PLpro were determined via a single wavelength anomalous dispersion experiment. anomalous completeness 99.4 (98.5) 92.4 (92.6) 100 (100) Rmerge 0.085 (0.76) 0.041 (0.79) 0.061 (0.78) CC1/2 0.99 (0.83) 0.99 (0.54) 1 (0.93) CC* 0.99 (0.95) 1 (0.84) 1 (0.98) I/I 17.13 (3.42) 20.52 (1.97) 34.01 (3.69) Wilson B-factor (2) 75.15 46.79 74.96 Phas plasmids encoding FLAG-tagged Ub (0.25 g), HA-nsp3C-4-V5 (0.25 g) and MERS-CoV-PLpro-V5 (0.15 g) were co-transfected. total amounts of transfected DNA were equalized to 2 g. fected DNA were equalized to 1 g by the addition of empty pcDNA vector. cells were lysed in 1 passive lysis buffer (Promega) at 16 h post-transfection, cells were lysed in 1 passive lysis buffer. a cDNA fragment encoding the PLpro domain was cloned into bacterial expression vector pASK3 in-frame with N-terminal Ub and a C-terminal His6 purification tag to produce pASK-MERS-CoV-PLpro. the sequence encoding amino acids 1480\u20131803 of the MERS-CoV pp1a/pp1ab polyprotein was PCR-amplified, cloned downstream sp3\u20134 (amino acids 854\u20133246) flanked by an N-terminal HA tag and a C-terminal V5 tag was optimized based on the human codon usage frequency. potential splice sites and polyadenylation signals were removed. sequence encoding MERS-CoV PLpro (amino acids 1479\u20131803) was PCR-amplified using synthetic plasmid DNA as a template and clon coV-PLpro were cultured to an A600 of 0.6 in lysogeny broth at 37 \u00b0C. protein expression was then induced with 200 ng/ml anhydrotetracycline. the cells were pelleted, resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 200 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme) pCG1 expressing the ubiquitin-specific processing protease 1 (Ubp1) was used (37) in vitro DUB activity assays were performed as described by van Kasteren et al. cell pellets were resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (150 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 1 m NaCl, 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride), lysed using a french pressure cell (AMINCO) cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation (17,211 g at 4 \u00b0C) and the supernatant containing the His6-SUMO-PLpro propylamine (Ub-3Br) is a modified form of Ub with a reactive C terminus that forms an irreversible covalent linkage to the active site cysteine of DUBs. the resulting PLproUb complex was dialyzed into 20 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, and was removed by gel filtration using a superdex 75 column. single crystals of closed PLproUb and unbound PLpro were cryoprotected in 1.85 m AmSO4, 15% glycerol and 22% PEG 4000, 0.1 m trisodium citrate, pH 5.6, 10% 1,2-propanediol before flash cooling in liquid nitrogen. initial phase estimates for reflections collected from unliganded and Ub-bound PLpro were determined via a single wavelength anomalous dispersion experiment. = = 90\u00b0 = 120\u00b0 a = b = 176.92 c = 84.55; = 90\u00b0 = 120\u00b0 Crystallographic data Wavelength () 1.28294 1.28280 1.28219 Resolution range () 45.15\u20132.60 (2.90\u20132.80)a 44.23\u20132.15 (2.22\u20132.15) 44.24\u20132.60 (2.90\u20132.80) Total observations 137,170 (13,780) 124,058 (12, plasmids encoding HA-nsp3C-4-V5 and MERS-CoV-PLpro-V5 were co-transfected to assess the in trans cleavage activity of MERS-CoV-PLpro. at 18 h post-transfection, cells were lysed in 2 LSB using the trans-blot turbo transfer system. 93T cells in 24-well plates were transfected with 5 ng of plasmid pRL-TK (Promega) encoding Renilla luciferase; IFN--Luc firefly reporter plasmid (25 ng); innate immune response inducer plasmids encoding RIG-I(2CARD), MAVS, or IRF3(5D) at 16 h post-transfection, cells were lysed in 1 passive recombinant PLpro purified the enzyme from E. coli and incubated it with either Lys48- or Lys63-linked poly-Ub chains. the enzyme degraded both Lys48- and Lys63-linked chains in a concentration-dependent manner. mutating the active site nucleophile (C1592A) severely reduced the activity of the enzyme toward both Ub linkage types. activity of PLpro active site mutant (C1592A) was assessed at a concentration of 2 m. Isopeptidase T (IsoT; 0.5 g/reaction) served as a positive control (69) PLpro is shown in green, and the covalently bound Ub molecule is orange. arrows indicate the active site residues are depicted as sticks. PLpro is shown in green and the covalently bound Ub molecule is orange. PLproUb complex that crystallized in space group P63 revealed weak density for the covalently bound Ub molecule. high temperature factors for atoms comprising the modeled Ub molecule suggested that it was not rigidly bound to the protease despite being covalently linked to the active site cysteine. further analysis revealed that the Ub molecule was fully exposed to solvent and not involved in crystal contacts. the closed MERS-CoV PLpro PLpro fingers domain was found to be shifted 26\u00b0 away from the palm domain compared with that of SARS-CoV PLpro. a slight difference in the Ub binding orientation, with the MERS-CoV PLpro-bound Ub being positioned closer toward helix 7 of the palm domain. in the MERS-CoV PLproUb complex, Ub is found shifted toward helix 7 compared with the SARS PLproUb complex. the cleft formed between the palm and thumb domains of PLpro guides the C-terminal 72RLRGG76 motif of Ub toward the protease active site. the oxyanion hole of the PLpro active site appears to be composed of backbone amides from residues Asn1590, Asn site with the indole nitrogen of its side chain oriented such that it is probably involved in forming part of the oxyanion hole (51).. it was recently shown that MERS-CoV PLpro L1587W mutants show greater catalytic efficiency than wild-type PLpro (48, 49) residue Arg74 is hydrogen-bonded to the main-chain carbonyl group of PLpro Thr1755. hydrogen bonds also occur between the side-chain amide and the side-chain carboxylate of PLpro asp1646. the BL2 loop between strands 15 and 16 is indicated with an arrow. BL2 loop of unbound PLpro was resolved in two monomers of the asymmetric unit. the third showed weak electron density for BL2 and high temperature factors. PLpro mutants demonstrate a significant degree of flexibility in the BL2 loop region in the absence of substrate. PLpro residues interacting directly with Ub were replaced with larger, bulkier residues that would prevent Ub binding without affecting the structural integrity of the active site. mutated PLpro residues are located at a distance from the PLpro active site. hydrophobic interaction is shown between Val1691 of PLpro and Ile44 of Ub. Thr1653 of PLpro is shown hydrogen-bonded to Gln49 and Glu51 of Ub. asn1673 and Val1674 of PLpro, which do not interact with Ub, are also displayed. a hydrophobic interaction between PLpro and Gln1708 of PLpro and Val1706 of PLpro was found to occur in this complex. we hypothesized that mutating residues asn1673 and Val1674 near the zinc ribbon may also disrupt Ub recognition. lytic Cleavage of the nsp34 Site using a previously described ectopic expression assay (61) we monitored the effects of amino acid substitutions in PLpro on overall levels of Ub-conjugated proteins in HEK293T cells. we assumed that the successful processing of the nsp34 site in HA-nsp3C-4-V5 is indicative of unaltered proteolytic cleavage capability of PLpro. HEK293T cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding HA-nsp3C-4-V5 (wild type and mutants) plasmids encoding HA-nsp3C-4-V5 (which does not contain PLpro), PLpro-V5 (wild type and mutants) and GFP (as a transfection control) cleavage resulted in the generation of full-length HA-tagged PLpro-V5 was co-expressed with FLAG-Ub, and levels of FLAG-Ub-conjugated cellular proteins were visualized via Western blotting. expression of wild-type PLpro resulted in a strong decrease of the accumulation of FLAG-Ub conjugates. asn1673 and Val1674 may form part of a binding site that recognizes an additional distal Ub within a Lys63-linked chain. these mutants may still be able to process Lys63-linked poly-Ub chains by recognizing a single Ub monomer at the end of a poly-Ub substrate. these mutations did not influence DUB activity of PLpro. pathogens have evolved mechanisms to subvert these Ub-dependent pathways. for arteriviruses, it has been shown that the DUB activity of their PLP2 is involved in antagonizing IFN- activation upon ectopic expression. for equine arteritis virus, this was confirmed during infection in host cells. PLpro activation was measured via co-expression of a firefly luciferase reporter gene. another co-transfected plasmid encoding Renilla luciferase was included as an internal control. activation of the IFN- promoter induced by expression of either RIG-I(2CARD) or MAVS was set at 100%. expression of full-length MERS-CoV nsp3 did not significantly inhibit IFN- promoter activation after stimulation with IRF3(5D) results suggest that the subcellular localization of the protease may be important in determining its substrate specificity. all experiments were repeated independently at least four times. luciferase activity was measured using an unpaired two-tailed Student's t test. p values of 0.05 were considered significant. mutant R1649Y suppressed MAVS-induced IFN- promoter activity more effectively than wild-type PLpro. hek293T cells were transfected with plasmids under control of the IFN- promoter, Renilla luciferase, and MERS-CoV PLpro wild type and mutants. p34 cleavage site targeting the Ub-binding site of the enzyme. this demonstrates for the first time that the DUB activity of MERS-CoV PLpro is specifically responsible for suppressing the innate immune response. recombinant PLpro was incubated with 2.5 g of Lys48-linked (A) or Lys63-linked (B) poly-Ub chains of different length in each reaction for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C. activity of the PLpro active site mutant (C1592A) was assessed at a concentration of 2 m. the thumb domain packs against the thumb domain composed of helices 2\u20137. the thumb domain is composed of strands 6, 7, and 14\u201319. the fingers domain is composed of strands 10, 11, 13, 14, and 19. PLpro structure is not shown because it is highly similar to the open PLproUb structure. movement of the zinc ribbon motif was determined by measuring the distance between the zinc atom of the respective structures. figures were created using PyMOL (70). the structure with the fingers domain shifted toward bound Ub (space group P6522) will be referred to as \u201copen\u201d PLproUb. the structure with the fingers domain shifted toward bound Ub (space group P6522) will be referred to as \u201cclosed\u201d PLproUb. a superposition of the closed MERS-CoV PLproUb complex (green) and the SARS-CoV PLproUb complex (purple; Protein Data Bank entry 4M0W) using SSM superpose in Coot (45) the Ub molecules bound to the MERS-CoV PLpro domain and SARS-CoV PLpro domain are depicted as tubes in orange and pale cyan. the palm and thumb domains pack against the thumb domain composed of helices 2\u20137. the thumb domain packs against the thumb domain composed of strands 6, 7, and 14\u201319. arrows indicate the active site residues are depicted as sticks. our PLpro structure is not shown because it is highly similar to the open PLproUb structure. movement of the zinc ribbon motif was determined by measuring the distance between the zinc atom of the respective structures. the fingers domain in this crystal form was moved toward Ub (space group P63) the PLproUb structure with the fingers domain positioned away from Ub (space group P6522) will hereafter be referred to as \u201copen\u201d PLproUb. the structure with the fingers domain shifted toward Ub (space group P6522) will be referred to as \u201cclosed\u201d PLproUb. images were created using PyMOL (70). the closed PLproUb structure crystallized in space group P6522. the PLpro domain crystallized in space group P63. the palm and thumb domains contain a right-handed fingers, palm, and thumb domain organization as well as an N-terminal Ub-like (Ubl) domain. the packing of the palm and thumb domains forms a cleft leading into the active site. the thumb domain is composed of strands 6, 7, and 14\u201319. active site residues are shown as sticks with Gly75 and the 3CN linker of Ub covalently linked to Cys1592 of PLpro. PLpro structure is not shown because it is highly similar to the open PLproUb structure. crystal packing in this space group allowed multiple crystal contacts between the bound Ub monomer and surrounding symmetry mates. the PLproUb structure with the fingers domain positioned away from Ub (space group P63) will hereafter be referred to as \u201copen\u201d PLproUb, whereas the structure with the fingers domain shifted toward Ub (space group P6522) will be referred to as \u201cclosed\u201d PLproUb. PLpro crystallized in space group P63, where Ub no longer faces the solvent. images were created using PyMOL (70). the PLpro active site is composed of a Cys1592-His1759-Asp1774 catalytic triad. the oxyanion hole of the PLpro active site appears to be composed of backbone amides from residues Asn1590, Asn1591, and Cys1592. the residue is likely involved in forming part of the oxyanion hole (51) interactions between open PLpro (green) and the C-terminal RLRGG motif of Ub (orange) are depicted in A and B. the main-chain amide of the 3CN linker forms a hydrogen bond with the main-chain carbonyl of PLpro residue Gly1758. the active site leu1587 residue is also shown. the electron density is a maximum likelihood weighted 2Fo Fc map contoured. PLpro was resolved in two of three monomers of the asymmetric unit. the third showed weak electron density for BL2 and high temperature factors. a structurally analogous BL2 loop was found to be in an open conformation with poorly defined electron density in the absence of substrate. PLpro residues interacting directly with Ub were replaced with larger, bulkier residues that would prevent Ub binding. individual mutation of eight different PLpro residues and combinations thereof were generated. these residues are located at a distance from the PLpro active site. Residue Ile44 of Ub interacts with the hydrophobic side chain of Val1691 of PLpro. two arginine residues, Arg1649 of PLpro and Arg72 of Ub, are oriented so that the guanidinium groups of these residues are arranged in a stacked conformation. we hypothesized that it may inhibit association with the distal Ub on Lys63 poly-Ub chains based on a superposition of a Lys63-linked di-Ub model onto the PLpro-bound Ub molecule of the closed PLproUb complex structure determined here. the tip of the fingers domain of this DUB acts as an S2 recognition site, binding to the distal Ub of a linear di-Ub molecule (57). nsp34 site in HA-nsp3C-4-V5 is indicative of unaltered proteolytic cleavage capability of PLpro. wild-type PLpro was able to cleave HA-nsp3C-4-V5 substrate in trans. the PLpro active site mutant C1592A was unable to cleave the nsp34 site. plasmid encoding HA-nsp3-4-V5, which includes the PLpro domain, was transfected (lanes 1 and 15), and cleavage resulted in the generation of full-length HA-tagged nsp3 and V5-tagged nsp4. cleavage was measured from the generation of n-terminal HA-tagged nsp3C and C-terminal V5-tagged nsp4 residues located on helix 7 displayed the clearest reduction of PLpro DUB activity. a PLpro T1653R/V1691R double mutant also displayed reduced DUB activity. a more conservative substitution at the same position, V1691L, had a much less pronounced effect on DUB activity. the R1649Y mutant was found to have even greater DUB activity than wild-type PLpro. this residue was found to interact with Arg72 of Ub via a cation- interaction. it is possible that the R1649Y mutant retains the ability to interact with Arg72 of Ub via a cation- interaction. luciferase-based reporter gene assays were designed to determine if the DUB activity of MERS-CoV PLpro alone suffices to antagonize the IFN- pathway. innate immune signaling was induced in HEK293T cells by expression of one of three signaling factors, RIG-I, MAVS, or IRF3. MERS-CoV PLpro significantly reduced the IFN- promoter activation that could be induced by expression of either RIG-I(2CARD) or MAVS. this effect was concentration-dependent, whereas the PLpro active site mutant was unable to block IFN- promoter activation. together this suggested that PLpro inhibits innate immune signaling at least downstream of the MAVS adaptor. HEK293T cells were transfected with a combination of plasmids expressing a firefly luciferase reporter gene under control of the IFN- promoter, Renilla luciferase. innate immune response inducers RIG-I(2CARD), MAVS, or IRF3(5D) and increasing amounts of MERS-CoV PLpro wild-type, active site mutant C1592A (A, C, and expression of wild-type PLpro reduced MAVS-induced IFN- promoter activity to 20% of the control. active site mutant C1592A reduced it by only a few percent compared with the untreated control. expression of these mutants resulted in higher IFN- promoter activity, with relative luciferase values of 54 and 58% respectively. 293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding a firefly luciferase reporter gene under control of the IFN- promoter, Renilla luciferase. at 16 h post-transfection, cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was measured. all experiments were repeated independently at least four times. ala1656 resides in a region of PLpro that recognizes both Ub and a region of the nsp3C-4 construct that was used to test cleavage efficiency. our results demonstrate that the DUB activity of MERS-CoV PLpro inhibits IFN- promoter activation when innate immune signaling is induced. ane domain can inhibit MAVS-, RIG-I-, and MDA5-dependent IFN- promoter activation only with a functional PLpro active site. a simple inactivation of the protease/DUB would not only fail to prove the specific involvement of the DUB activity, it would also prevent viral. the method described here selectively removed the DUB activity of the MERS-CoV PLpro domain while leaving polyprotein processing activity at the nsp34 site unhindered. we were able to show that Lys48- and Lys63-linked poly-Ub chains are processed in vitro by MERS-CoV PLpro at similar rates, which is in accordance with recent report by B\u00e1ez-Santos et al. structural work is necessary to identify the specific determinants of ISG15 recognition by MERS-CoV PLpro. the specific removal of DUB and potentially deISGylating activity from viral proteases may open new avenues to engineer attenuated viruses for use as modified-live virus vaccines."}
