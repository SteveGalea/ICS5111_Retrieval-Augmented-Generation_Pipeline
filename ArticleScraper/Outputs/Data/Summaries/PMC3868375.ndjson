{"summary": "infected cells carry out signaling cascades that serve to eliminate the invading microbes. this response is initiated by detection of pathogen-associated molecular patterns by host pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), including toll-like receptors (TLRs), RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), and nucleic acid sensors. ISG15 was identified in IFN-treated lysates as a 15 kDa protein. it is composed of 2 ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domains connected by a short linker. each Ubl domain assumes a -grasp fold that can be superimposed onto the ubiquitin structure. HERC5 in humans and HERC6 in mice appear to function as the dominant E3s for the ISG15 system because specific knockdown of their expression with siRNA abrogates nearly all ISG15 conjugates induced by IFN. a single ISG15 molecule appears to be conjugated to a lysine residue, although multiple lysines may be modified within the same protein. enzymes that could target ISG15 conjugates identified USP2, USP5, USP13, and USP14 as potential candidates. Interestingly, like ISG15 itself, all members of the ISG15 conjugation cascade are upregulated by type I IFNs. several studies have shown that ISG15 regulates viral growth in cell culture. many of these antiviral phenotypes have not been confirmed in vivo. neither ISG15/ nor UbE1L/ mice display a phenotypic difference compared to wildtype animals during VSV infection. we have also not detected a phenotype in ISG15/ mice after WNV infection. phenotypes have not been seen in every viral model evaluated. the use of UbE1L/ mice was vital in distinguishing whether ISGylation contributed to the ISG15-dependent protection during viral infection. the infection of ISG15/ mice with a Sindbis virus encoding wildtype ISG15 rescued the ISG15/ mice from death. targeting the ISGylation system appears to be a successful immune evasion strategy for vaccinia virus since wildtype and ISG15/ mice respond similarly to infection with wildtype vaccinia virus. several viruses encode proteins with ISG15 deconjugating activity. several hundred candidate ISG15 targets span a diverse array of biological processes. only a limited number of these proteins have been validated. there is currently no known universal fate for all ISGylated proteins. a recombinant virus in which lysine 41 was mutated to arginine resulted in reduced NS1 ISGylation. lysines 126 and 127 were the critical amino acids required for conjugation in vivo. the fate of ISGylated proteins is still an area of active research. cH6 Suppresses thioester bond formation to ubiquitin 136 Takeuchi and others (2006) IRF3 Inhibits ubiquitin-mediated degradation 193/360/366 Lu and others (2006). Shi and others (2010) EFP Inhibits E3 ligase activity 117 Zou and others (2007) 4EHP Enhances m7GTP cap structure-binding activity 121/130/134/222 Okumura and others (2008) RIG-I free ISG15 exists both intra- and extracellularly. it is possible that intracellular free ISG15 is released passively into the extracellular space from dead or damaged cells. but since the trafficking mechanism of ISG15 is undefined we will refer to extracellular ISG15 as secreted ISG15. recombinant soluble ISG15 could induce T cells to secrete IFN-. this was attributed to the ISG15-induced production of IFN- by T cells. this effect was indirect because ISG15 did not stimulate proliferation of purified NK cells alone, but required total PBMCs. ISG15 derived from the uninfected or early stage-infected erythrocytes was shown to act as a chemoattractant for and activator of neutrophils. these 4 initial studies suggested that secreted ISG15 acts as a positive regulator of multiple cell types. inherited mutations in ISG15 can lead to the loss of protein expression. coincubation of PBMCs with ISG15 and IL-12 greatly augmented IFN- secretion compared to ISG15 alone. NK cells, not T cells, were the main IFN- producer. a synergistic relationship exists between these two cytokines. sequence analysis identified 2 other homozygous coding variants in one ISG15/ patient and 9 in another. it is possible that these mutations also contribute to susceptibility to MSMD and perhaps to the regulation of IFN- by ISG15. the effects on macrophages were dependent on the C-terminal LRGG residues of ISG15. this was the first study to suggest a role for the LRGG motif of ISG15 for something other than conjugation. this report also highlights the significance of ISG15 in nonmammalian species. the synergy noted between ISG15 and IL-12 in the Casanova study could indicate that the receptor is induced by IL-12 or works in concert with another IL-12-induced protein to stimulate IFN- production. the study in C. semilaevis revealed that the LRGG motif was important for this stimulatory activity. mice lacking ISG15 showed no increase in lethality and instead phenocopied wildtype mice. this study implied that the protection afforded by ISG15 was not dependent on its conjugated form but rather on free ISG15. there is the possibility that UbE1L is not the only E1 enzyme for ISG15. free ISG15 functions not as an antiviral factor, but as an immunomodulatory protein that negatively regulates the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. the actions of extracellular or intracellular free ISG15 have been most clearly tied to the induction of IFN- secretion by cytotoxic lymphocytes. free intracellular ISG15 is responsible for the effect by binding noncovalently to other intracellular proteins and modulating their functions. this noncovalent, intracellular interaction appears to control the ability of Ebola VLPs to egress from cells in vitro. this noncovalent, intracellular interaction appears to control the ability of Ebola VLPs to egress from cells in vitro. free ISG15 acts as a positive regulator of cytokine production. other systems implicate free ISG15 as a negative regulator of cytokine production. discovery of extracellular and intracellular proteins with which ISG15 interacts will be necessary to confirm these hypotheses. two other Ubls, SUMO-3 and MNSF-, are present extracellularly. ubiquitin binds to the chemokine receptor CXCR4 (Saini and others 2010). this raises the possibility that IL-12 may induce expression of the receptor. despite these achievements, many questions remain for all 3 forms of ISG15. a very small proportion of the identified ISGylated host target proteins have been examined. the recognition that several viruses encode immune evasion proteins aimed at disrupting conjugation suggests that ISGylation is important post-translational modification during infection. recombinant ISG15 may be a valuable tool when greater IFN- levels would be beneficial, such as during insufficient responses to mycobacteria. neutralization of secreted ISG15 may contribute to dampening of IFN-mediated immunopathology."}
