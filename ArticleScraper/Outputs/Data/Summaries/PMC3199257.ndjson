{"summary": "the aim behind triage is to improve the emergency care and prioritize cases in terms of clinical urgency. medical care might lead to adverse consequences like delay in providing care, compromise in privacy and confidentiality, poor physician-patient communication, failing to provide the necessary care altogether, or even having to decide whose life to save when not everyone can be saved. patients often have to wait long before being seen by a doctor and even longer before being transferred to a hospital bed. quality of care is compromised, staff morale is impaired and cost of care increases. a system is needed to cope with the situation and prioritize cases according to the right terms. triage systems are designed to assist allocation decisions in this regard. they are more difficult when a condition is life-threatening and the scarce resource potentially life-saving. the crux of the matter is the seeming inappropriateness of abstract allocation principles at the level of face-to-face relationships. triage is deficient in two ways. the aim of this paper is to bring the two strands together. the central question is how can triage systems in emergency care be ethically assessed. emergency department triage Triage is a system of clinical risk management employed in emergency departments worldwide to manage patient flow safely when clinical needs exceed capacity. it promulgates a system that delivers a teachable, auditable method of assigning clinical priority in emergency settings. the burden in emergency care is increasing and so are the expectations of patients. in ESI, there are five-levels of these triage score. the most commonly used guidelines for ED triage on the international literature are the Manchester Triage Score [17,28,29], the Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale [28-31], the Australasian Triage Scale [28,32] and Emergency severity index [27,29]. triage is a brief encounter between triage officer and patient, which takes two to four minutes. triage is a continuous process in which clinical characteristics need to be checked regularly to ensure that the priority remains correct. strategy for off-site rapid triage (SORT) was disseminated by H1N1 Response Centre to reduce a potential surge of health system utilization without denying needed care. the Sacco Triage Method is an evidence based outcome driven triage which considers the resources to maximize the expected survivors. triage decisions are based on a simple age adjusted physiological score that is computed routinely on every trauma patient. emergency department triage Triage is a system of clinical risk management employed in emergency departments worldwide to manage patient flow safely when clinical needs exceed capacity. it promulgates a system that delivers a teachable, auditable method of assigning clinical priority in emergency settings. the burden in emergency care is increasing and so are the expectations of patients. in ESI, there are five-levels of these triage score. the most commonly used guidelines for ED triage on the international literature are the Manchester Triage Score [17,28,29], the Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale [28-31], the Australasian Triage Scale [28,32] and Emergency severity index [27,29]. triage is a brief encounter between triage officer and patient, which takes two to four minutes [34] triage is a continuous process in which clinical characteristics need to be checked regularly to ensure that the priority remains correct. rapid triage was disseminated by H1N1 Response Centre to reduce a potential surge of health system utilization without denying needed care. LSI = life saving interventions is an evidence based outcome driven triage. ED triage introduces several ethical questions, which have received less attention in the general literature on triage. ED triage is the first step in assessing the emergency of a situation. it involves actively treating persons to enable them to act autonomously. a triage officer takes the decision without consent of the patient. the triage officer takes the decision without consent of the patient. emergency treatment can be given under the doctrine of necessity if an adult patient lacks capacity to give consent. respect for autonomy in the form of informed consent is often not the first ethical priority. the fact that informed consent cannot factually be realized in many ED situations does not mean that respect for autonomy cannot be taken into account at all here. triage guidelines aim to avoid harm to the patient by sorting the patients as quickly and efficiently as possible. lack of communication of triage times and categories is one of the causes of aggression and violence of patients and accompanying persons towards emergency staff. ekwall et al. reported 67% of patients who exhibited violent behaviour did not wait for treatment or had been in the emergency room for less than one hour [58] ekwall et al. suggest the importance of addressing the psychosocial needs of patients of varying levels of urgency through their social interactions at triage [59]. a triage system based on this principle would presumably operate on a first-come, first served basis [16], giving equal consideration to all, no matter how resource intensive one's treatment will be. the principle of utility, on the other hand, holds that actions should be judged by their consequences and how far they produce the greatest net benefit among all those affected. the principle of utility, on the other hand, holds that actions should be judged by their consequences. triage systems may seek to achieve the health benefits of survival, restoration or preservation of function, relief of suffering, and so on. to maximize the chosen benefits overall, triage systems may dictate that treatments for some patients be delayed, often resulting in poorer outcomes for those patients. the principle of priority to the worst-off depends on complex empirical aspects of the situation. a triage system is a quick and seemingly impersonal system of sorting patients. it can quickly and efficiently sort patients according to clinical priority. the principle of nonmaleficence is under pressure because triage can reinforce the physical and psychological harms. the care ethics perspective is an ethical theory that evolved out of the Kohlberg-Gilligan debate on moral psychology and from the work done by social scientists. the care ethics perspective has become a very influential viewpoint within ethical theory [39] the four dimensions of care can help us understand the ethical meaning of ED triage as a fundamental part of the entire care process. the first dimension, 'caring about', is the starting point of care and refers to being concerned about the condition of a person and paying attention to the vulnerability of this person confronted with. the corresponding ethical attitude is attentiveness and refers to the actual recognition of a need that should be cared about. good care requires feedback and verification that the patient's needs are actually being met. the dimension of care receiving is mostly lacking in the practice of triage and at times leads to conflict. the result is not merely inconvenience but rather a degradation of the entire care process. care ethics should always be considered against a broader horizon of social practices as a whole. a careful interpretation of ED triage makes clear that a relationship between care professionals and patients cannot be seen as isolated interactions. a careful interpretation of ED triage makes clear that a relationship between care professionals and patients cannot be seen as isolated interactions. a hospital-wide strategy for fixing ED overcrowding requires cross-departmental and cross-role coordination at all times. Respect for autonomy is a pivotal criterion for decision-making in health care. it provides that competent persons have the right to make choices regarding their own health care. a study published in 1994 on refusal of emergency care showed that among 106 refused patients, 35 (33%) had appropriate visits and four of them had to be hospitalized. a triage officer takes the decision without consent of the patient which can be considered the paternalistic approach of decision making. et al reported that even acutely ill emergency patients preferred respect for autonomy in medical decision making. a study on ED communication concluded that the physician-patient encounter was brief and lacking in important health information. good communication requires listening as well as talking and is usually necessary for giving patients information about the proposed intervention. triage guidelines aim to avoid harm to the patient by sorting the patients as quickly and efficiently as possible. studies have found an association between overcrowding and reduced access to care, decreased quality measures, and poor outcomes. the ultimate goal of triage is to preserve and protect endangered human lives. tendency of overtriage particularly in patients with trauma may be a tendency for beneficence. in triage, tendency of overtriage particularly in patients with trauma may be a tendency for beneficence. a triage system based on this principle would presumably operate on a first-come, first served basis [16], giving equal consideration to all, no matter how resource intensive one's treatment will be. the reluctance of physicians to abandon any patient whom they believe they can save may give implicit support to this type of triage. the principle of utility holds that actions should be judged by their consequences. triage systems recognize this because in emergency situations, the resources are scarce in relation to the needs of the patients. which one of the criteria will maximize utility depends on complex empirical aspects of the situation and on the triage officer's assessment capacities. the third principle of justice, i.e. the principle of priority to the worst-off, is reflected in the third principle of justice. the four principles of biomedical ethics (autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence, and justice) are interesting but insufficient. they do not offer a comprehensive ethical view for two reasons: (1) they only offer fragmented pieces of the triage puzzle; (2) they do not provide a view on the dynamics of the care process. the results from this ethical analysis are interesting but insufficient. respect for autonomy is a pivotal criterion for decision-making in health care. it provides that competent persons have the right to make choices regarding their own health care. respect for autonomy is a pivotal criterion for decision-making in health care. study reveals that among 106 refused patients, 35 (33%) had appropriate visits and four of them had to be hospitalized. decision without consent conflicted with the principle of respect of autonomy but also with the demands of good quality care. a study on ED communication concluded that the physician-patient encounter was brief and lacking in important health information. good communication requires, most importantly, listening as well as talking. the common triage guidelines have not considered communication skills and informed consent as part of triage procedure. studies in different centres have found an association between overcrowding and reduced access to care, decreased quality measures, and poor outcomes. lack of communication of triage times and categories is one of the causes of aggression and violence of patients and accompanying persons towards emergency staff. tendency of overtriage particularly in patients with trauma may be a tendency for beneficence. a triage system based on this principle would presumably operate on a first-come, first-serve basis [16] giving equal consideration to all, no matter how resource intensive one's treatment will be. reluctance of physicians to abandon any patient who they believe they can save may give implicit support to this type of triage. the principle of utility holds that actions should be judged by their consequences and how far they produce the greatest net benefit among all those affected. in itself, the principle of utility remains silent with regard to which types of benefit are to be promoted. a triage system would give priority to treatment of this clearly disadvantaged group. it would be highly inefficient if maximizing the benefits to this group would imply investing a disproportionate share of scarce resources into a group of patients who are not likely to survive. a triage system is a quick and seemingly impersonal system of sorting patients according to clinical priority. the principle of nonmaleficence is under pressure because triage can reinforce the physical (long waiting times, increasing pain and suffering, deteriorating condition) and psychological harms that come with the pathological conditions. the principle of beneficence is compromised by the pressure upon health professionals, which in turn reinforces their feelings of fear for making wrong decisions. the care ethics perspective has become a very influential viewpoint within ethical theory. in this paper, we will apply the care ethics perspective to the issue of ED triage because we are convinced that the care ethics perspective offers important ethical insights into the dynamic character of triage within the setting of emergency care. by focusing on the dynamic aspects of delivering acute medical care, it provides an important addition to the predominantly fragmented principle-based approach. the triage officer takes up the responsibility to improve the patient's condition as much as possible. this means that he tries to make the right decisions in order to guarantee that the patient will be cared for as well as possible, given the circumstances of scarcity of resources. this dimension of care requires the necessary competence to provide the actual care in a professional way. a careful interpretation of ED triage makes clear that a relationship between care professionals and patients cannot be seen as isolated interactions. a careful interpretation of ED triage makes clear that a relationship between care professionals and patients cannot be seen as isolated interactions. a relationship between care professionals and patients cannot be seen as isolated interactions. ethically sensitive decision-making in ED triage is influenced by institutional factors, such as the presence of policies, but also by the ethical culture of the hospital as organization. a hospital-wide strategy for fixing ED overcrowding requires cross-departmental and cross-role coordination at all times. the triage officer takes up the responsibility to improve the patient's condition. it refers to assuming the responsibility for providing the necessary care. this means that he tries to make the right decisions to ensure that the patient will be cared for as well as possible, given the circumstances of scarcity of resources. framework of interpersonal relationships Care practices always take place within a framework of interpersonal relationships, where the caregiver(s) and the care receiver are reciprocally involved in a dynamic interaction of giving and receiving care. the characteristics of relatedness and reciprocity should also be understood against the background of a very particular social context. a careful interpretation of ED triage makes clear that a relationship between care professionals and patients cannot be seen as isolated interactions. a relationship between care professionals and patients is always situated in a broader care process, which is enacted in the teamwork of caregivers. a careful interpretation of ED triage makes clear that a relationship between care professionals and patients cannot be seen as isolated interactions. a clinically and ethically based form of triage planning would incorporate the following characteristics. a clinically and ethically based ED triage process is not only based on a momentary decision made by one person. it also takes relevant ethical principles as respect for autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence, and justice into account.
