{"summary": "the induction of Ab responses by recombinant subunit vaccines is the leading approach to the development of an efficacious vaccine. advantages of subunit vaccine approaches over live-attenuated and killed vaccines include the ability to focus immune responses upon a tailor-made immunogen. there is therefore intense interest in the development of subunit vaccine approaches with optimal humoral immunogenicity. regimes using an adenovirus prime followed by a boost using recombinant protein in an adjuvant conventionally regarded as relatively weak were capable of inducing Ab titers which matched those induced by the most potent protein/adjuvant regimes (8, 11) there has been relatively little exploration of the process by which these vaccines induce humoral responses. a proportion of the total immune response to viral vector vaccination is directed against structural components of the vector rather than toward the desired target (the Ag expressed from the inserted transgene) in this study, we made use of flow cytometric assays designed to identify Ag-specific GC B cells and Tfh cells to compare the induction of these cell populations by a variety of viral vector and protein/adjuvant vaccine platforms. human adenovirus serotype 5 (AdHu5) is the most widely studied adenovirus vaccine vector. it is among the most immunogenic adenovectors in mice and primates (21\u201323) there are a variety of differences between and within adenovirus species. the MVA used here expressed GFP as a marker. we have previously produced both GFP-expressing and markerless versions of several MVA viruses and observed no detectable difference in Ag transgene immunogenicity (32) as an adjuvant for protein vaccines, we first selected alum, which is the most widely used adjuvant in current licensed vaccines. ary but similar squalene o/w formulations, such as MF59 (Novartis) and AS03 (GSK), are among the few relatively novel adjuvant formulations. we detected OVA expression by Western blotting of the supernatants of infected cell cultures. HEK293A cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% FCS. the production of the AdHu5-OVA, AdHu5-empty, and MVA-OVA vaccines has been reported elsewhere (8, 37) the transgene included the human tissue plasminogen activator signal sequence and the full-length chicken OVA sequence. this substitution has previously been reported to prevent N-linked glycosylation at this residue. chicken embryo fibroblasts were purified by centrifugation through a sucrose cushion and titered by fluorescence plaque assay. doses used were 1 108 infectious units for AdHu5, 1 107 PFU for MVA, 10 g of OVA protein, 25 l of Addavax, and 85 g of Al3+ in the form of Al(OH3) inguinal lymph nodes were harvested, immersed in Optimum Cutting Temperature (OCT) compound (VWR Chemicals), and immediately frozen on dry ice. thirty-five-micrometer sections were cut using a cryostat (Leica), fixed in acetone for 10 min at 20\u00b0C, air-dried for 30 min, and stored at 20\u00b0C. prior to staining, non-specific Ab binding was blocked using a solution of 1% v/v normal mouse tetramers were obtained from the NIH Tetramer Core Facility (Emory University) tetramers showed peptides TEWTSSNVMEERKIKV, AAHAEINEA, and HAAHAEINEA. purified protein was extensively dialyzed and incubated with SA-PE (Life Technologies) OVA-reactive B cells were defined using fully stained cells from naive mice or those vaccinated with AdHu5-empty. cells were stained with a tetramer displaying the irrelevant peptide PVSKMRMATPLLMQA (human CLIP residues 87\u2013101) adenovirus is probably the leading viral vector platform for Ab response induction. we used human adenovirus serotype 5 (AdHu5) expressing the model Ag OVA. this is at the upper end of the range of doses used in mouse studies. MVA was dosed at 1 107 PFU, also at the upper end of the range of doses used in previously published mouse studies (7, 8), 2% of the highest dose we are aware of being used in humans, and 5\u201310% of a typical human dose (10, 26, 29). the MVA used here expressed GFP as a marker; we have previously produced both GFP-expressing and markerless versions of several MVA viruses. hek293A cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% FCS. hek293A cells were infected with either MVA-OVA or a MVA-PfAMA1. hek293A cells were cultured similarly and infected with either MVA-OVA or a MVA-PfAMA1. female C57BL/6 mice were housed in a specific-pathogen-free facility. the production of the AdHu5-OVA, AdHu5-empty, and MVA-OVA vaccines has been reported elsewhere. the thymidine kinase locus is the most widely used promoter for recombinant poxvirus vaccine vectors (40, 41) vaccines were grown in chicken embryo fibroblasts, purified by centrifugation through a sucrose cushion and titered by fluorescence plaque assay using the GFP marker. immunohistology Inguinal lymph nodes were harvested, immersed in OCT compound (VWR Chemicals) and immediately frozen on dry ice. thirty-five-micrometer sections were cut using a cryostat (Leica), mounted on Superfrost Ultra Plus slides. staining reagents were used as set out in Supplemental Table I. GL7 was chosen as a GC B cell marker. tetramers displaying the peptides TEWTSSNVMEERKIKV. cells were incubated for 2 h at 37\u00b0C in R10-FcBlock medium. cells were incubated for 2 h with class II tetramers before surface and viability stain in PBS. samples were acquired on an LSR-II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) in vitro OVA expression by the AdHu5-OVA and MVA-OVA vectors was confirmed by Western blot. the rationale for this choice of vaccine platforms and doses is set out in detail in Materials and Methods. mice were immunized IM with AdHu5-OVA (108 infectious units), MVA-OVA (107 PFU), OVA protein in Addavax (10 g in 25 l), or OVA protein in alum at day 0 (10 g with 85 g of Al3+ as Al(OH)3). all animals were subsequently boosted with OVA protein in alum at week 8. inguinal lymph nodes were harvested, sectioned, and stained to detect B cell zones and GC B cells. responses to AdHu5-OVA, MVA-OVA, OVA protein in Addavax and alum were slightly weaker again. a portion of the overall GC response to viral vector immunization was directed toward the vectors themselves. we developed flow cytometric staining panels capable of detecting OVA-specific GC B cells and Tfh cells. gating thresholds were set with reference both to IgD+ naive cells within the same mouse and to GC B cells from naive mice or mice vaccinated with adenovirus. Ag-specific Tfh cells were then identified as those binding OVA peptide\u2013class II tetramers, with gating thresholds set with reference to Tfh cells from naive mice or mice vaccinated with adenovirus. further controls included assessment of binding of a control tetramer [I-A(b)\u2013human CLIP] to Tfh cells in OVA-vaccinated mice. the approach is simple and readily transferable to other Ags. there is increasing appreciation in the field of the important role of Tfh cells in orchestrating B cell responses. DLNs were harvested at the indicated time points after immunization with adenoviral vectors or protein in adjuvant. immunizations were staggered in time such that harvesting and flow cytometry was synchronous for all animals. total number of recovered DLN lymphocytes quantified by cell counting (A) responses to protein/adjuvant vaccination had markedly contracted by this time. GC responses may be of importance in permitting optimal memory B cell generation and somatic hypermutation. the magnitude of the response to an adenovirus lacking an inserted Ag transgene was closely similar to that induced by the OVA-expressing adenovirus. mice were immunized with various regimes as indicated on graph legends. adenovirus resulted in greater populations of both total GC B cells and OVA-specific GC B cells than in protein\u2013adjuvant vaccination. adenovirus induced very few OVA-specific GC B cells despite its ability to induce a vigorous overall response. non-transgene-expressing adenovirus does not adjuvant responses to protein. it is unclear whether the Ag needs to be expressed in the same cells experiencing virus-triggered innate activation (Ag in cis) it is unclear whether the degree of spatiotemporal linkage between the protein Ag and the virus which is necessary might be sufficiently loose. cohort of mice was culled at day 54 (preboost) and day 85 (postboost) results are expressed in AU (see Materials and Methods) in vitro OVA expression by the AdHu5-OVA and MVA-OVA vectors was confirmed by Western blot. the ability of different vaccine platforms to induce primary and recall Ab responses was shown in Supplemental Fig. 1. a protein/alum boost vaccination formulation was the same for all mice. all animals were subsequently boosted with OVA protein in alum at week 8. results are expressed as AU, defined as in Materials and Methods. each point represents an individual animal, with a total of 6\u201318 animals per condition. C57BL/6 mice were immunized with AdHu5-OVA, MVA-OVA, OVA protein in Addavax, or unadjuvanted OVA protein. inguinal lymph nodes were harvested, sectioned, and stained to detect B cell zones and GC B cells. white scale bars, 400 m. and (C) show quantitative comparison of GC area. we developed flow cytometric staining panels capable of detecting OVA-specific GC B cells and Tfh cells. FIGURE 3 shows gating of DLN GC B cells, defined as IgDGL7+ after pregating on live singlet DumpB220+ lymphocytes. gating thresholds were set with reference to naive mice or mice vaccinated with a non\u2013OVA-expressing adenovirus. etramer binding to Tfh cells from a mouse vaccinated with AdHu5-OVA was negligible. further controls included assessment of binding of a control tetramer [I-A(b)\u2013human CLIP] to Tfh cells in OVA-vaccinated mice which was negligible. we initially found that we were unable to discern Ag-specific GC B cells using either monomeric OVA labeled with a fluorophore ( MHC-II - OVA peptide/streptavidin-fluorophore tetramers stained a proportion of Tfh cells from mice vaccinated with an OVA-expressing adenovirus. this approach avoided the possibility of spurious results arising from the transfer of transgenic OVA-specific CD4+ T cells (OT-II) the number of GC B cells (B), OVA-specific GC B cells (C), total Tfh cells (D) and OVA-specific Tfh cells (E) were quantified by flow cytometry. responses expressed as cells in DLNs per mouse, i.e., from multiplication of the total number of lymphocytes recovered from that animal\u2019s DLNs. adenovirus-specific PD1+ Tfh cells were barely detectable by day 37 after immunization with either platform. large numbers of plasma cells were present within 6 d after vaccination with adenovirus. kinetics differed substantially from those of GC B cells. C57BL/6 mice were immunized with various regimes as indicated on graph legends. responses assessed by flow cytometry using staining panels and gating schemes. adenovirus resulted in greater populations of both total GC B cells and OVA-specific GC B cells than in protein\u2013adjuvant vaccination. the ability of adenovirus to induce robust adaptive immune responses appears to be dependent on innate immune activation. it is unclear whether the Ag needs to be expressed in the same cells experiencing virus-triggered innate activation (Ag in cis) Fig. 6 shows that there was little or no effect of coadministered empty adenovirus on Ab or cellular responses. there was no statistically significant difference between IgG responses to unadjuvanted OVA protein and OVA protein mixed with empty adenovirus at preboost or postboost timepoints. OVA-specific GC B cell response (D); total Tfh response (E); and OVA-specific Tfh response (F) were set with respect to naive mice. points represent individual mice with open points in (D) and (F) representing values calculated from 10 events. adenovirus and MVA induced larger populations of non-insert-specific GC B cells than protein/adjuvant vaccination. adenovirus and MVA induced larger populations of non-insert-specific GC B cells than protein/adjuvant vaccination. possible explanations for this might include high ratio of viral:transgene protein expression, transience of Ag expression after MVA immunization, and induction of dendritic cell apoptosis by MVA. caution is clearly required regarding their ability to induce responses to soluble secreted inserted Ags in Ag-naive animals. relationship between measured responses in DLNs and humoral responses was imperfect. ab induction by Ad-OVA was similar to that by protein/Addavax. despite superior OVA-specific GC B and Tfh responses, ab induction by protein/addavax was superior to protein/alum. s\u2014adenoviruses are an increasingly attractive choice. the other authors have no financial conflicts of interest."}
