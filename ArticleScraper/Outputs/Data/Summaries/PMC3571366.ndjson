{"summary": "each family contains viruses that are associated with host groups. members of the family Herpesviridae infect mammals, birds, or reptiles. members of the family Alloherpesviridae (referred to as alloherpesviruses) infect fish or frogs. iology was first suggested in 1907 (5) and was supported over 5 decades later by the detection of particles in the growths that have the distinctive morphology of a herpesvirus (6). two phases of infection have been described, namely acute, generally lethal, systemic disease in young carp and a recurring, generally nonlethal, proliferative skin disease linked to periods of lower water temperature among survivors. the first samples may have been collected as early as 1996. the first definitive description dates from outbreaks that occurred in the united states and Israel in 1998. the virus was first isolated and proven to be the etiological agent by Hedrick and colleagues (17, 20) strain KHV-U has a genome of 295,146 bp, consisting of a unique region (U) flanked by a terminal direct repeat (TR) the genome sequence of a noncyprinid member of the same genus, anguillid herpesvirus 1 (AngHV1; species Anguillid herpesvirus 1) has also been published (39) and was recently updated as a result of a transcriptomic study. the viruses were grown on a koi fin cell line (KF-1) as described previously (17), passaging the former via an infected cell medium and the latter via infected cells. the sacI restriction endonuclease profiles of these preparations and a virion DNA preparation from CyHV-U (38) were compared by agarose gel electrophoresis. the final consensus sequence represented an average 9.2-fold redundancy at each nucleotide over the iterative assemblies of the combined data sets against speculative junction sequences between contigs were constructed by using Maq 0.7.1 (45) and visualized by using Tablet 1.10.05.21 (46) this allowed the joining of several contigs, thus reducing the number to seven. a total of 10,250,990 reads (31.72% of the combined sets, consisting of 45.48% of the single-end set and 29.12% of the paired-end set) matched this sequence, the the geneBank accession numbers of the CyHV1 and CyHV2 genome sequences are JQ815363 and JQ815364 respectively. the European nucleotide archive accession number of the CyHV2 read data is ERP001303. average redundancy in TR (14.8-fold) was greater than that in U (9.5-fold) the XbaI restriction endonuclease profile generated from the DNA preparation by agarose gel electrophoresis was closely similar to those reported for Japanese CyHV1 isolates (42) the data comprised a single-end set (5,117,383 reads of 50 nucleotides) and a paired-end set (27,197,794 reads of 48 the final alignment represented an average 1,802-fold redundancy at each nucleotide over the complete genome. average redundancy in TR (3,981-fold) was greater than that in U (1,676-fold). potential genome termini of CyHV1 and CyHV2 were located on the basis of multiple sequence reads sharing the same end and sequence similarities to the CyHV3 termini. the CyHV2 genome contains an unusual 220-bp inverted repeat that is absent from CyHV1 and CyHV3. copies to the right of ORF25C and ORF48 are shown. the intervening region is present in a single orientation in virion DNA. the derived genome sizes (Table 1) are those of the sequences obtained. each CyHV sequence contains several tandem direct reiterations of short sequences. telomere-like repeats are present in the genomes of some members of the family Herpesviridae. reiterations may mediate integration of herpesvirus genomes into the telomeric regions of host chromosomes in vitro and in vivo. end is located in a similar context in each CyHV genome, to the right of ORF156. however, the left end in CyHV2 is translocated, being situated between ORF3 and ORF5, at a position that is well within TR in CyHV1 and CyHV3. encoding of predicted signal peptides or conserved amino acid sequences may have been missed. some of the ORFs included do not encode functional proteins. this caveat is important in light of the finding that many such ORFs are translated in cell culture by human cytomegalovirus. the nomenclature used for CyHV1 and CyHV2 ORFs is based on that for CyHV3 (38), in which ORFs are numbered along the genome from ORF1 to ORF156, with ORF1 to ORF8 duplicated in TR. the most-extensive regions are present in CyHV1, specifically in TR near the right end of U. the number of functional protein-coding ORFs predicted in the CyHV genomes should be viewed as best estimates. examples include the ORF44-ORF45 region, where it is possible that ORF45 is extended at its 5\u2032 end, perhaps replacing ORF44, and the ORF101 region, where an additional ORF might be incorporated into the antiparallel strand. the original CyHV3 map was derived in part on the basis of comparisons with incomplete sequence data for CyHV AngHV1 ORFs are conserved convincingly in all sequenced alloherpesviruses. ictalurid herpesvirus 1 (IcHV1;

ORF130 is translocated to the right of ORF133 and ORF139 is translocated to the right of ORF150 in CyHV2. ORF4 is inverted and translocated to the right of ORF150 in CyHV2 effectively transferring it from TR to U. the total number of ORFs shared by the CyHVs and AngHV1 may be as many as 55 (counting duplicates) the degree of genome colinearity among the CyHVs and AngHV1 is much less than that among the CyHVs. it is notable that the CyHVs may be perceived as exhibiting a pattern of recent coevolution (though perhaps not cospeciation) with their hosts. two ORFs (ORF25B and ORF151A) appear to be fragmented in CyHV2. it is not known whether the presumed mutations occurred in vivo or in vitro. no fragmented ORFs were identified in CyHV1. the evolutionarily dynamic nature of the ORF25 family is illustrated by the presence of remnants of additional members downstream from ORF25B and ORF25C in CyHV2. these vestiges lack ATG initiation codons and appear to comprise the 3\u2032 ends of ORFs encoding the transmembrane domains of ORF25 family proteins. the TNFR and RING families are named for the similarity of their encoded proteins to tumor necrosis factor receptor or for the presence our comparative analysis constitutes the first examination of a set of substantially related alloherpesvirus genomes. the CyHV1 and CyHV2 genome sequences will underpin future studies on the pathogenesis of carp herpesviruses, including those aimed at epidemiological, diagnostic, and therapeutic innovations. CG dinucleotide depletion is an evolutionary phenomenon that is thought to have occurred via methylation of the C residue followed by spontaneous deamination to yield a TG dinucleotide. this phenomenon has been attributed to methylation of latent genomes in dividing cell populations (48).

ORFs are oriented rightward (R) or leftward (L) in the CyHV1 (1), CyHV2 (2), and CyHV3 (3) genomes. absence of notation indicates absence of the ORF. the ORF encoding DNA packaging terminase subunit 1 (ORF33 in the CyHVs) is well conserved among members of the order Herpesvirales (1). the conserved region contains a cysteine-rich motif that is conserved throughout members of the family Herpesviridae. a motif conserved in CyHV ORF66 and its counterparts in other alloherpesviruses. the sequences are aligned against the carp JunB sequence. the sequences are shown aligned against the carp JunB sequence. the predicted type 1 membrane protein encoded by ORF99 has clear orthologs in all sequenced alloherpesviruses except AngHV1 (39) they are weakly similar to the virion envelope protein encoded by AngHV1 ORF67 (59) this indicates that the ancestor of ORF99 and its counterparts in AngHV1 and other alloherpesviruses might have been derived from an ancient gene capture event involving a coronavirus the best candidates from proteomic studies of capsids for capsid triplex subunit 1 are ORF53 in IcHV1 and its ortholog ORF42 in AngHV1 (58, 59). no sequence relationships have been demonstrated, but a short conserved motif is evident. it is also possible that another ORF should be added to the maps and counted among the core set. the CyHV genomes share a total of 120 orthologous ORFs (counting duplicates) arranged with a large degree of colinearity. however, various rearrangements to the left and right of the central section are evident in CyHV1 and CyHV2 compared with CyHV3. ORFs that differ in location or orientation between CyHV1 and CyHV3 or CyHV2 and CyHV3 are indicated by gray shading, with the ORF prefix omitted from names. of the 76 ORFs that are not conserved among all three CyHVs, 50 encode predicted membrane-associated proteins (i.e., they possess potential signal peptides, transmembrane domains, or both) CyHVs are more closely related to each other than they are to the other member of the genus Cyprinivirus (37) it is notable that the CyHVs may be perceived as exhibiting a pattern of recent coevolution (though perhaps not cospeciation) with their hosts. it is not the case when the CyHVs are considered in relation to AngHV1 (37) all three CyHVs have multiple members of the ORF2, TNFR, ORF25, and RING families. ORF22 is present in all CyHVs and as a family of two in CyHV2 and CyHV3 and as a family of three only in CyHV2. the TNFR and RING families are named for the similarity of their encoded proteins to tumor necrosis factor receptor or for the presence of a RING-type, C3HC4 zinc finger domain. the JUNB family is named for the similarity of its predicted encoded proteins to the DNA-binding and dimerization domains of the transcription factor and oncoprotein JunB. pesviruses include pesviruses aimed at epidemiological, diagnostic, and therapeutic innovations."}
