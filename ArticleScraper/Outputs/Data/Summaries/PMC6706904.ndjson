{"summary": "study included 123 children divided into five groups according to infection agent and treatment protocol. group I included those with MP infection without documented viral infection, treated with only macrolides and methylprednisolone. group IV included those with MP infection and documented viral infection, treated with only macrolides. sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing refractory MP pneumonia were 67 and 67% respectively. serum lactate dehydrogenase, interleukin 18 and ferritin constitute the critical combination of biomarkers useful for predicting refractory MP pneumonia."}
