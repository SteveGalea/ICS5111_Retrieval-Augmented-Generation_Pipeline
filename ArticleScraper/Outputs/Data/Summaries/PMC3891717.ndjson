{"summary": "the live MV vaccine has a long record of safety and efficacy, especially since the reversion to pathogenicity has never been observed with this vaccine. the live MV vaccine is injected subcutaneously or dispensed as an aerosol. cosal immunity is often the first line of defense against pathogens. many studies indicate that systemic immunization produce strong anti-viral systemic responses. mucosal immunization can stimulate both the mucosal and systemic response. a prime-boost regimen can circumvent and maximize the induction of a specific humoral and cellular immune response against MV and the transgene. a MV pre-existing immunity prior immunization with a recombinant measles vector (rMV); 500, 2,000 or 5,000 mIU of MV neutralizing antibodies were administered intravenously (i.v.) to mice. the following day, blood samples were taken and mice were immun hCD46tg mice were given 0, 500, 2,000 or 5,000 mIU MV-nAb i.v. one day prior i.m. immunization with 1 105 pfu rMV-SIVgag. UV-inactivated virus and mice that did not receive measles nAb prior immunization served as controls. the i.m. boost was performed at week 4 with 1 105 pfu rMV-SIVgag. the same animals were then boosted i.m. at week 4 with 1 105 pfu of rMV-SIVgag. the pre-immune mice (with 500 mIU of MV-nAb) showed generally less MV-nAb. but a boost could triple the amount of MV-nAb to reach 600 mIU. the control mice primed via i.n. route generated less MV-nAb. a persistent MV IgG and neutralizing antibodies (MV-nAb) could be induced in the presence of up to 500 mIU of MV-nAb by i.m. or i.n. immunization. a prime-boost schedule, i.n.-i.m. or i.m.-i.m. could significantly increase the magnitude of MV antibody responses. hCD46tg mice were given 0 or 500 mIU MV-nAb prior to i.m. or i.n. immunization with 1 105 pfu rMVSIVgag. samples were collected at 4 weeks post prime i.m. or i.n. boost. hCD46tg mice were given 0 or 500 mIU MV-nAb one day prior to either i.m. or i.n. immunization with 1 105 pfu rMV-SIVgag. ELISPOTs were performed 2 weeks post immunization. the ability to mount a cellular immune response against MV and the transgene was negatively affected by the pre-existing anti MV-nAb only when immunization was performed i.m. no inhibitory effect was observed upon i.n. immunization. the group of animals that did not receive any MV-nAb induced the highest fold increase of all groups. hCD46tg mice were given 0, 500, 2,000 or 5,000 mIU MV-nAb i.v. one day prior i.m. immunization with 1 105 pfu rMV-SIVgag. the median fold increase between day one and week 2 was inversely correlated with the amount of MV-nAb received. the i.m. boost was performed at week 4 with 1 105 pfu rMV-SIVgag. the same animals were then boosted i.m. at week 4 with 1 105 pfu of rMV-SIVgag. i.m-i.m. immunization route significantly increased anti-MV antibodies by 8-fold. the naive control group had a mean MV-nAb titer of 1,153 mIU at 4 weeks post i.m. prime, which was increased to reach a mean titer of 15,124 mIU after boost. the pre-immune mice (with 500 mIU of MV-nAb) showed generally less MV-nAb, but a boost could triple the amount of MV-nAb to reach 600 mIU. a persistent MV IgG and neutralizing antibodies (MV-nAb) could be induced in the presence of up to 500 mIU of MV-nAb by i.m. or i.n. immunization. a prime-boost schedule, i.n.-i.m or i.m.-i.m. could significantly increase the magnitude of MV antibody responses. hCD46tg mice were given 0 or 500 mIU MV-nAb prior to i.m. or i.n. immunization with 1 105 pfu rMV-SIVgag. median values are shown as lines. hCD46tg mice were given 0, 500, 2,000 or 5,000 mIU MV-nAb i.v. one day prior i.m. immunization with 1 105 pfu rMV-SIVgag. UV-inactivated virus and mice that did not receive measles nAb prior immunization served as controls. the i.m. boost was performed at week 4 with 1 105 pfu rMV-SIVgag. the same animals were then boosted i.m. at week 4 with 1 105 pfu of rMV-SIVgag. the pre-immune mice (with 500 mIU of MV-nAb) showed generally less MV-nAb. but a boost could triple the amount of MV-nAb to reach 600 mIU. the control mice primed via i.n. route generated less MV-nAb. a persistent MV IgG and neutralizing antibodies (MV-nAb) could be induced in the presence of up to 500 mIU of MV-nAb by i.m. or i.n. immunization. a prime-boost schedule, i.n.-i.m. or i.m.-i.m. could significantly increase the magnitude of MV antibody responses. hCD46tg mice were given 0 or 500 mIU MV-nAb prior to i.m. or i.n. immunization with 1 105 pfu rMVSIVgag. titers reached up to 1:1,280. hCD46tg mice were given 0 or 500 mIU MV-nAb one day prior to either i.m. or i.n. immunization with 1 105 pfu rMV-SIVgag. ELISPOTs were performed 2 weeks post immunization. the ability to mount a cellular immune response against MV and the transgene was negatively affected by the pre-existing anti MV-nAb only when immunization was performed i.m. the magnitudes of cellular immune responses were relatively lower as compared with i.m. immunization. in humans, MV-nAb titers of around 200 mIU are considered protective. naturally infected persons induce higher MV-nAb titers of up to 3,000 mIU. a single intramuscular immunization failed at inducing a strong humoral immunity against the transgene. a homologous and heterologous prime-boost immunization was performed using the intramuscular and the intranasal routes. the cellular response against MV and SIVgag was quite well developed with i.m. immunization and less developed with the i.n. immunization. highest amount of IFN-producing T-cells were observed after an i.m-i.n. prime-boost regimen, with 550 SFC per 106 cells for MV and 125 SFC per 106 cells for SIVgag. as compared with an i.m. prime, the i.m.-i.n. regimen seem to be optimal for a local cellular response induction, but not for a systemic response. all viruses have been produced on human fetal lung fibroblasts called MRC5 cells and reached titers of 5 105 to 2 106 pfu. most experiments used the empty vector as control. the animals were euthanized, and sera were collected and pooled. the sera were concentrated using a Vivaspin column (Sartorius Biotech) the sera were then diluted in PBS to reach the desired concentration before intravenous injection. spleens were meshed through a 70m cell strainer (BD Falcon) in PBS 2% FCS. the erythrocytes were lyzed using 1.5ml BD Pharm Lyse (BD Biosciences PharMingen) for SIVgag. all viruses have been produced on human fetal lung fibroblasts called MRC5 cells. rMV virus batches were controlled for correct sequences of the vector and the transgene. va was collected via the retroorbital venous sinus at different time points. the animals were euthanized, and sera were collected and pooled.
