{"summary": "syncytial virus (RSV) infects nearly every child by the age of 2. it causes severe lower respiratory disease in 2% of these infants. in the developing world RSV infection causes the death of an estimated 66,000 to 199,000 children under five years of age annually. a mAb against CX3CR1 and mutations in the G protein CX3C motif reduced RSV infection of these cells. a mutant of this virus lacking its G gene is able to infect HAE cultures [24], albeit poorly, suggesting that the RSV F protein also has attachment activity. the following reagent was obtained through BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH. reagent was obtained through HEp-2 Cells, NR-43938. all viruses were propagated and titered in HeLa cells. rgRSV was incubated with increasing concentrations of heparan sulfate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), protein A-purified mAb L9 [35] or mAb 131-2g [36]. all mAbs were diluted in DMEM 10% FBS and incubated with virus for 30 min prior to inoculation of HeLa and HAE cultures. 293A cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1, MP341 or F170A using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) or infected with rgRSV, WT (Long strain), RSV2, RSV6a or C186S viruses (MOI of 0.1) the A2 strain RSV G protein was detected by immunoblot with 130-2g (gift from Dr. L.J. Anderson), L9, or 131-2g and anti-mouse antibody images were taken on an Olympus BX61 microscope (Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) transfection and infection of CHO A745 cells CHO A745 cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding human CX3CR1. at 24 hr post transfection, parallel wells of cells were inoculated as above with rgRSV at an MOI of 0.1. no animals were excluded from analyses. no blinding was done. at 5 days post inoculation, 3 mice per group were examined. MAb L9-resistant mutants RSV2 (F165L, F170L, I175T and C186R) and RSV6a (F168S, F170P, C186R and V225A) were selected as previously described from the WT (Long strain) of RSV [30] all viruses were propagated and titered in HeLa cells (American Type Culture Collection) mAb isolate 2\u201320 or B1 were incubated with 5 g/ml mAb 131-2g. all mAbs were diluted in DMEM 10% FBS. cells were incubated with 25 g/ml CX3CR1 specific rat mAb. fected with pcDNA3.1, MP341 or F170A using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) or infected with rgRSV, WT (Long strain), RSV2, RSV6a or C186S viruses (MOI of 0.1) cells were disrupted with Triton-X100, boiled, separated under reducing conditions by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. CHO A745 cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding human CX3CR1. cells were stained with a PE-labeled anti-CX3CR1 antibody. at 24 hr post transfection, parallel wells of cells were inoculated with rgRSV. the protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. all experimental procedures were performed under isoflurane anesthesia. data from three replicates of each experimental condition are expressed as mean standard deviation. rgRSV was incubated with (A) soluble HS, (B) anti-G protein mAb 131-2g or IgG1 (isotype control), or (C) anti-G protein mAb L9 or IgG2a for 30 min prior to inoculation of HeLa and HAE cultures. infected cells (fluorescent foci) were counted at 24 hr post inoculation. mAb 131-2g binds near and interferes with the function of a domain in the G protein that is important for attachment to HAE cultures. this results confirm our hypothesis that RSV uses a different receptor to infect HAE cells compared to HeLa cells. however, mAb L9 also inhibited rgRSV infection of HAE cells. mAb 131-2g neutralized 2\u201320 infection of HAE cultures, but not of HeLa cells. mAb 131-2g effectively neutralized 2\u201320 infection of HAE cultures. mAb 131-2g is an N-terminally anchored type II transmembrane protein. mAb 131-2g binds a fragment of the G protein that includes amino acids 1 to 173. the amino acid sequence of this fragment is less than 44% conserved between the strains. no neutralization resistant virus variants have been isolated. mAb L9 detected the WT RSV G protein, but not the G protein from the two L9 neutralization-resistant RSV mutants. MAb 131-2g was also able to detect WT RSV, but not the two L9 neutralization-resistant RSV mutants. both mutants contain multiple mutations in their G proteins. mAb L9 neutralizes RSV infection of HAE cultures more efficiently than mAb 131-2g. mAb 131-2g neutralizes RSV in HeLa cells, unlike 131-2g. this indicates that the epitopes of these mAbs overlap. but the epitopes of these mAbs overlap, not identical. a cross-section of a paraffin embedded HAE cultures stained with polyclonal antibodies to human CX3CR1 (red) images were taken with a 20X objective. cells were incubated with 25 g/ml anti-CX3CR1 or isotype control. incubation of HAE cultures with anti-CX3CR1 inhibited RSV infection to a greater extent. but again did not reduce infection of HeLa cultures. if CX3CR1 is a receptor for the RSV G protein, the G protein CX3C motif would likely be important for infection of these cells. the result of this defect is a severe deficiency in total glycosaminoglycan expression, including expression of HS. we transiently expressed CX3CR1 in CHO A745 cells, a cell line deficient in HS expression. expression of CX3CR1 resulted in a 4-fold increase in infection compared to the same cells transfected with empty vector. 24 hr post-transfection cells were inoculated with rgRSV in the (C) absence or (D) presence of 25 g/ml anti-CX3CR1 or 5 g/ml L9, 131-2g, or their isotype controls. infected cells (fluorescent foci) were counted at 24 hr post inoculation. three rgRSV experiments were combined and expressed as the mean s.d. of 9 mice. rgRSV retained some of its infectivity for CX3CR1-/- mice. this suggests that RSV also uses an alternate, less efficient mechanism for initiating infection in the absence of the G protein-CX3CR1 interaction. rgRSV was incubated with (A) soluble HS, (B) anti-G protein mAb 131-2g or IgG1 (isotype control), or (C) anti-G protein mAb L9 or IgG2a for 30 min prior to inoculation of HeLa and HAE cultures. infected cells were counted at 24 hr post inoculation. mAb 131-2g binds near and interferes with the function of a domain in the G protein that is important for attachment to HAE cultures but not for attachment to HeLa cells. this results confirm our hypothesis that RSV uses a different receptor to infect HAE cells compared to HeLa cells. however, mAb L9 also inhibited rgRSV infection of HAE cells. mAb 131-2g neutralized 2\u201320 infection of HAE cultures, but not of HeLa cells. mAb 131-2g effectively neutralized 2\u201320 infection of HAE cultures. mAb 131-2g is an N-terminally anchored type II transmembrane protein. mAb 131-2g binds a fragment of the G protein that includes amino acids 1 to 173. the amino acid sequence of this fragment is less than 44% conserved between the strains. no neutralization resistant virus variants have been isolated. ally purified virions from these mutants contain the G protein. mAb L9 detected the WT RSV G protein, but not the G protein. MAb 131-2g was also able to detect WT RSV, but not the two L9 neutralization-resistant RSV mutants. mAb L9 neutralizes RSV infection of HAE cultures more efficiently than mAb 131-2g. mAb 131-2g neutralizes RSV in HeLa cells, unlike 131-2g. mAb 131-2g is detectable on the apical surface of ciliated HAE cells. cross-section of a paraffin embedded HAE cultures stained with polyclonal antibodies to human CX3CR1 (red) images were taken with a 20X objective. cells were incubated with 25 g/ml anti-CX3CR1 or isotype control. rgRSV and C186S RSV were comparably infectious for HeLa cells. rgRSV and C186S RSV were comparable infectious for HAE cultures. rgRSV with intact CX3C motif was comparable to RSV completely lacking the G protein. CHO A745 cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding (A) CX3CR1 or (B) empty vector. expression of CX3CR1 resulted in a 4-fold increase in infection compared to the same cells transfected with empty vector. 24 hr post-transfection cells were inoculated with anti-CX3CR1. infected cells were counted at 24 hr post inoculation. data in C and D are expressed as the mean s.d. of 3 wells. rgRSV experiments were combined and expressed as the mean s.d. of 9 mice. rgRSV retained some of its infectivity for CX3CR1-/- mice. this suggests that RSV also uses an alternate, less efficient mechanism for initiating infection in the absence of the G protein-CX3CR1 interaction. tripp et al. found that the RSV G protein mimics the chemokine CX3CL1 (fractalkine) in its ability to bind to its receptor, CX3CR1 [23]. CX3CR1 is expressed in epithelial cells, smooth muscle cells, microglia, neurons, T cells, monocytes, dendritic cells, and NK cells [47\u201353] mAb 131-2g neutralizes infection of clinical isolates for HAE cultures. mAb 131-2g blocks G protein binding to CX3CR1. mAb 131-2g neutralizes infection of clinical isolates for HAE cultures. some antibodies to the G protein, one of only two neutralizing antigens in RSV, can neutralize RSV infection only when assessed on physiologically relevant HAE cultures. some antibodies to the G protein, one of only two neutralizing antigens, can neutralize RSV infection only when assessed on physiologically relevant HAE cultures. fusion inhibitors against human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) display similar inhibition in vivo and in HAE cultures, but not in immortalized cell culture. mAbs against the G protein induces neutralizing antibodies and protects against RSV challenge."}
