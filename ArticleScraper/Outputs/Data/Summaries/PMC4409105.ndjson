{"summary": "entry is the first essential process by which viral genomes are delivered from extracellular virions into the cell nucleus for viral replication [1, 2], which is an ideal target to block infection. there is increasing evidence that viral attachment to the cell surface by influenza hemagglutinin (HA) is not sufficient for endocytotic routes. differential expression and structural complexity of the FGFR family may generate functional diversity in response to different ligands. it remains unclear how the expression of FGFR 1 to 4 are regulated by influenza A virus infection. it remains unclear how the expression of FGFR 1 to 4 are regulated by influenza A virus infection. the human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cell line A549 from the ATCC was cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 100 units penicillin-streptomycin ml-1 at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% (v/v) CO2. RNA isolation and real-time quantitative PCR Total protein extractions were boiled in 4 Protein SDS-PAGE Loading Buffer (Takara) for 5 min. protein extractions were resolved on a SDS-PAGE, then transferred onto 0.45-m NC membrane (GE Whatman) anti-phosphorylated FGFR1 polyclonal antibody (1:1000 dilution, Lianke Biotechnology Ltd.), anti-actin monoclonal antibody (1:5000 dilution, Sigma-Aldrich) after three washes with TBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, they were incubated with goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated cells were permeabilized with PBS containing 10% (v/v) FBS, 3% (w/v) BSA, and 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 overnight at 4\u00b0C. after two washes with PBS containing 0.2% (w/v) BSA and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, cells were incubated with an anti-influenza A virus NP primary antibody overnight at room temperature for 1 h 293T cells were transfected with pWPXL-R1 or pWPXL-R4 and two other helper plasmids. recombinant lentivirus vector was used as a control. for lentivirus infection, A549 cells were incubated with diluted virus supernatant. the results were performed in GraphPad Prism software 4.0 (GraphPad Software, CA) data was shown as means s.e.m. Statistical significance was assessed by one-way analysis of variance. primer pairs of human FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, FGFR4, influenza virus M1 and GAPDH were designed using Primer Premier software 5.0. real-time PCR was performed in triplicate wells of a 96-well reaction plate on an ABI 7300 Real-Time PCR System. Western blotting assay Protein extracts from cell lysates were obtained with RIPA buffer mixed protease inhibitor cocktail (Thermo scientific) protein extractions were boiled in 4 Protein SDS-PAGE Loading Buffer (Takara) for 5 min and resolved on a SDS-PAGE, then transferred onto 0.45-m NC membrane (GE Whatman) Membranes with total FGFR proteins were blocked by 5% (w/v) non-fat dry milk for FGFR1 and FGFR4 silencing, a549 cells were transfected with 20 nM siRNA using Lipofectamine RNAiMax. the medium was replaced with fresh complete medium 6 h after transfection. cells were harvested 48 h after transfection for FGFR repression efficiency detection by real-time PCR and Western blotting. recombinant lentivirus was obtained from 293T cells and filtered through 0.45-m filters. for lentivirus infection, 293 cells were incubated with virus supernatant (>95% infection efficiency) supplemented with 6 g polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich) ml-1 for 8 h. cell lysates were prepared at 4\u00b0C with ice-cold RIPA buffer. for virus internalization, cells with prebound virus were warmed to 37\u00b0C for 30 min. for virus internalization, cells with prebound virus were warmed to 37\u00b0C for 30 min and then washed with acidic cold PBS-HCl (pH 1.3) for detection of internalized virus particles, but not attached particles. PR8 virus infection also decreased FGFR2 and FGFR3 mRNA expression at 12 hpi, which increased subsequently. the results showed that the FGFR1 and FGFR4 protein levels in A549 cells significantly decreased at 48 hpi, followed by mRNA expression levels. the mRNA levels of influenza virus M1 were detected using real-time PCR. the results showed that the mRNA levels in PR8-infected A549 cells were markedly elevated by FGFR1 siRNA#1 and siRNA#2, but not by FGFR4 siRNA#1, siRNA#2, or control siRNA. progeny virus titers of PR8 (C) or H5N1 (D) were determined using MDCK cells with the TCID50 assay. knockdown efficiencies of FGFR1 and FGFR4 by target siRNA were tested. A549 cells were transfected with FGFR1 siRNA#1, FGFR4 siRNA#1 and negative control siRNA. after 48 h of transduction, A549 cells were incubated with PR8 virus at an MOI of 0.01 for 4 h. similar results were observed in H5N1-infected A549 cells. effective exogenous expression of FGFR1 or FGFR4 was also confirmed. influenza A virus may evade the inhibitory effect by downregulating FGFR1 protein levels. tyrosine autophosphorylation of FGFR1 can be induced by extracellular stimuli [24]. previous results suggested that influenza virus infection downregulated FGFR1 expression. but whether FGFR1 kinase activation had an effect on virus replication has not yet been explored. the range 5\u201320 nM of PD173074 did not induce significant cytotoxicity. these results suggested that the repression of FGFR1 phosphorylation in A549 cells with PD173074 treatment could enhance influenza virus replication. overexpression inhibited influenza virus internalization, but not binding, during viral entry. previous results indicated that FGFR1 might play a suppressive role in virus binding and/or internalization. the ratio of NP/actin protein was determined based on densitometric analysis. values of P0.05 * were considered statistically significant and P0.01 ** highly significant. mRNA levels of FGFR1 (A), FGFR2 (B), FGFR3 (C) and FGFR4 (D) were detected using real-time PCR analysis. lysates of A549 cells were obtained at the indicated times post-PR8 infection. the mRNA expression levels of FGFR1 and FGFR4 were analyzed using real-time PCR. the effective repression of two proteins was also determined by Western blotting. FGFR1 silencing promoted PR8 and H5N1 virus replication in A549 cells. incoming vRNPs were detected at 4 h after PR8 virus infection. incoming vRNPs were located in the nuclei of A549 cells at 4 hpi. the percentage of NP-positive cells to the total number of cells was then calculated. influenza A virus replication could be reduced by lentivirus-mediated FGFR1 overexpression. recombinant lentivirus vectors for efficient delivery of exogenous FGFR1, FGFR4 or GFP to A549 cells were constructed. FGFR1 significantly decreased virus M1 mRNA levels in PR8-infected A549 cells. recombinant lentivirus expressing FGFR1, FGFR4 or GFP (as a control) after 48 h, A549 cells were infected with PR8 virus. the supernatants and lysates of A549 cells were harvested after 24 h virus infection. PD173074 is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of the FGFR family. it can inhibit autophosphorylation of FGFR1 in a dose-dependent manner. results showed that FGFR1 phosphorylation in PR8-infected A549 cells was significantly suppressed by PD173074 in a dose-dependent manner. the phosphorylated/total FGFR1 ratio indicated the fold change of FGFR1 phosphorylation. the results were expressed as means s.e.m. and P0.001 *** considered statistically highly significant. the application of sialidase potently inhibited virus attachment and internalization. there was little difference in virus binding among three groups of cells with or without sialidase. but in sialidase-untreated cells with FGFR1 overexpression, virus internalization was significantly reduced compared to the two other groups. studies have shown that influenza virus HA binding to sialic acid receptor is not sufficient to initiate virus entry. FGFR1 knockdown notably elevated virus entry efficiency during the early stages of IAV infection; furthermore, FGFR1 could inhibit virus internalization. FGFR contains a highly conserved region between the first and second IgG-like domains. HA-containing region abolished FGFR function of responding to basic FGF ligand. tyrosine kinase signaling is known to play important roles in IAV replication. a functional role of FGFR1 on PR8 and H5N1 infection was found in A549 cells. but whether FGFR1 has a universal effect in other human cells requires further study."}
