{"summary": "influenza infections cause several million cases annually, with severe pandemics causing high levels of morbidity and mortality. despite the importance of understanding the mechanisms of IAV-associated disease, the sources of the observed disease variation are unclear. morphic, interferon inducible Mx1 gene inhibits IAV replication and limits disease. many genes contribute to the host response [28]\u2013[35]. knock-outs often affect clinical disease primarily by altering the host inflammatory response [28], [29], [32], [35], [38]\u2013[40]. we identified a novel Mx1 allele in the CAST/EiJ mouse strain and sequenced the associated haplotype. by integrating QTL mapping with whole genome sequence information, we significantly reduced the number of candidate genes within each QTL. findings provide a clarification of the importance of host genetic variation in regulating the host response to infection. pre-CC mice showed no evidence for effects of age, generation of inbreeding, block effects or starting weights on gathered phenotypes. we found no evidence for effects of age, generation of inbreeding, block effects or starting weights on gathered phenotypes. the pre-CC population recapitulated the range of variation within any given phenotype. despite these correlations, individual pre-CC mice showed unique combinations of disease phenotypes. phenotypes were scored for aspects of damage to, and inflammatory cell infiltration around the airways (A), inflammatory cell infiltration around the vasculature (B), and damage and inflammatory cell infiltration in the alveolar spaces (C). the image of OR219 shows a relatively healthy looking lung. seven modules (B, D, F\u2013I, K) were enriched for specific gene ontology terms (Table S5) there was little to no overlap between the enriched categories across modules. we used the eigengene, an idealized representation of module transcription levels for each individual mouse, to correlate module expression levels with disease-related phenotypes. previous studies have identified a large effect IAV resistance gene, Mx1, on chromosome 16. a priori expectation was that we would identify a QTL over Mx1, validating our mapping approaches within the CC. QTL identified in the pre-CC population. 96.7 HrI3 Pulmonary edema 1:21.7\u201329.0 HrI4 Airway neutrophils 15:77.4\u201386.6 We grouped the eight founder alleles at HrI1 by their estimated effects on each phenotype [49], [54], [55] Alleles from five strains (A/J, C57BL/6J, 129S1/SvImJ, NOD/ShiLtJ and WSB/EiJ) three Mx1 alleles segregate in the pre-CC population, with the CAST/EiJ allele being functionally distinct from the classical protective Mx1 allele. this allele confers limited protection from viral replication, but does protect from virus-induced weight loss. we found no difference by qPCR (C) in expression of Mx1 at 2 days post-infection following influenza infection in a strain from each of these three functional classes. by sequencing Mx1 (D), we were able to identify five haplotypes across the eight founder strains. the most common haplotype in the CC contains a large (>2 kb) deletion that spans three coding exons (9, 10, and 11) that are highly conserved among placental mammals. this haplotype results in the presence of the same non-functional Mx1 gene in A/J, C57BL/6J, 129S1/SvImJ and NOD/ShiLtJ. a total of 307 transcripts with an eQTL at Mx1 (14.2%) had allele effects consistent with CAST/EiJ grouping with the resistant PWK/PhJ and NZO/HILtJ alleles. a total of 307 transcripts with an eQTL at Mx1 (14.2%) had allele effects consistent with CAST/EiJ grouping with the resistant PWK/PhJ and NZO/HILtJ transcripts where CAST/EiJ grouped with the susceptible alleles showed significant enrichments for a large number of GO terms. transcripts where CAST/EiJ was grouped with the resistant PWK/PhJ and NZO/HILtJ alleles showed a much more limited enrichment. despite the large effect of Mx1 on influenza response, there was large phenotypic variation within both the functional and non-functional Mx1 allele classes this region is annotated as containing 69 genes and 10 non-coding RNAs. animals with an A/J allele showed less weight loss than other animals. animals with a 129S1/SvImJ allele showed more weight loss than other animals. RNA of high quality was recovered from 60 mice within this Mx1-/- population. we used WCGNA to cluster the 6,000 most variable transcripts across this population. in total, this analysis identified eleven modules labeled M-W. we identified a suggestive QTL, HrI4, which explained 22.77% of the variation in airway neutrophils on chromosome 15. a 9.19 Mb region annotated as containing 206 genes and 35 non-coding RNAs. we challenged a new set of female animals from a small set of completely inbred CC lines with IAV. pulmonary edema was scored on the basis of evidence of transudates accumulating in the alveolar spaces. we used the estimated allele effects along with the whole genome sequences of the founder strains [57] to narrow the list of candidate genes within each interval. when a particular allele underlies a QTL, it is due to a causal genome feature corresponding to that allele, contrasted with the other alleles in the cross. we narrowed the candidate regions for HrI3 (Pulmonary Edema: NZO/HILtJ and WSB/EiJ alleles reducing edema) from 7.31 Mb to 1.01 Mb, containing 10/24 genes and 1/10 annotated non-coding RNAs. a single founder allele associated with either increased resistance (A/J) or susceptibility (129S1/SvImJ) contrasted with the unmarked genes had both A/J and 129S1/SvImJ SNPs. unmarked genes had both A/J and 129S1/SvImJ SNPs. we used 155 pre-CC mice, each from an independent, incipient CC line, as well as sets of mice (n = 5\u201311) from each of the eight CC founder strains. we assessed IAV-induced weight loss and clinical disease daily through four days post infection (D4) Virus-induced inflammation X X Airway neutrophils X Vascular inflammation X X Pathology Airway damage X X Pulmonary edema X Fibrin deposition X Transcription D4 lung expression X The infected founder strains varied significantly for all measured phenotypes. Founder strains could be grouped into susceptible (high viral titer, inflammation and weight loss) or resistant (low viral titer, little inflammation and weight despite these correlations, individual pre-CC mice showed unique combinations of disease phenotypes (e.g. low Log titer and severe D4 weight loss) not present in the founder strains of the CC. log titer and airway inflammation were significant predictors of D4 weight. log titer and airway inflammation together were significantly better predictors of D4 weight than either variable alone. a total of 11,700 genes passed quality control processing. eigengene values for eight of the twelve modules were correlated with multiple disease-related phenotypes. modules E and G correlated with aspects of Virus-induced inflammation and module D correlated with D4 weight. this results suggest that in this genetically diverse population severity of influenza infection is associated with wide-scale variation in a large number of biological processes within the lung. HrI1 explained 41.67% of the variation in weight loss (i.e. the adjusted R-squared for a model with all 8 strain effects), and similar amounts of variation in other phenotypes. we also conducted QTL mapping on the eigengenes of the expression modules to identify mQTL (module QTL) decreased influenza resistance (i.e. higher titers, higher weight loss, more pathology), increased module K and decreased expression of modules B and C. the NZO/HILtJ and PWK/PhJ alleles within the pre-CC population shared similar effects and increased influenza resistance. C57BL/6J had the highest mean level of up-regulation, with CAST/EiJ intermediate and PWK/PhJ having the lowest level of expression. this suggests that the differences between the CAST/EiJ and PWK/PhJ alleles are due to coding changes within the gene. arrows indicate locations of polymorphisms, with small arrows indicating non-coding changes. grey exons indicate those not transcribed due to either deletion and frameshift, or insertion and early stop codon. most common haplotype in the CC contains a large (>2 kb) deletion that spans three coding exons. WSB/EiJ also has a non-functional allele due to a nonsense mutation in exon 10 [56]. the other three strains have full length ORFs and each has a distinct protein sequence due to the different combinations of alleles at two non-synonymous SNPs. the genetic variants identified in our analysis and the regional assignment of sub-specific origin [47], [58] demonstrate that the CAST/EiJ strain has a divergent ha 2156 transcripts (18.4%) had expression levels significantly impacted by genotype at the most significant Mx1 marker. a total of 307 transcripts with an eQTL at Mx1 (14.2%) had allele effects consistent with CAST/EiJ grouping with the resistant PWK/PhJ and NZO/HILtJ alleles. 1207 transcripts with an eQTL at Mx1 (55.9%) had allele effects consistent with CAST despite the large effect of Mx1 on influenza response, there was large phenotypic variation within both the functional and non-functional Mx1 allele classes. despite the large effect of Mx1 on influenza response, there was large phenotypic variation within both the functional and non-functional Mx1 allele classes. titer and airway inflammation were a better predictor of weight loss than either variable alone. titer and airway inflammation were still significant predictors of weight loss. eight modules (M-O, Q, T-W) were significantly correlated with clinical disease and/or viral replication. two modules had no clear relationships with any phenotypes. absence of an mQTL overlapping the Mx1 region indicates that, as expected, the effect of the Mx1 locus on the coexpression network has been ameliorated in this population. genetic variation at HrI3 contributes to pulmonary edema in an independent set of Collaborative Cross lines. the animals were homozygous for various founder alleles across the entire candidate region for HrI3 and founder strain alleles were represented by two CC lines. if two strains are segregating from the other six, it is likely due to a common feature these two strains privately share. we used the allele effects plots to group founder strains underneath QTL peaks into two groups based on the largest difference between groups. HrI4 represented a case where a single founder allele associated with either increased resistance (A/J) or susceptibility (129S1/SvImJ) contrasted with the other six strains showing an intermediate phenotype. we identified 144 private A/J SNPs or small in/dels. these SNPs occur in or near 28 genes (7 genes unique to A/J, 13 unique to 129S1/SvImJ, and 8 overlapping between the unmarked genes had both A/J and 129S1/SvImJ SNPs. unmarked genes had both A/J and 129S1/SvImJ SNPs. s and transgenic lines [28]\u2013[30], [32], [34], [35], [39], [65], panels of genetically distinct mouse lines [44], [66], and classical RI panels [42], [45], [46] have been used to provide key insights into the role of specific genes in pathogenesis. these systems either interrogate the role of specific genes in the context of a single genetic background (e.g. knockouts) or analyze the impact of two variant alleles functional Mx1 alleles reduced viral titers, weight loss and clinical disease, inflammation and pathology. it is possible for multiple alleles to exist at any given locus. at any locus within the pre-CC population, up to eight distinct alleles exist. more studies are needed to better define whether the differential effect of the CAST/EiJ Mx1 allele are due to Mx1-associated signaling or more subtle effects on viral replication which subsequently affect inflammation and disease. this lack of structure across the genomes also allowed us to gain new insight into the relationships between coexpressed transcripts and disease outcomes. e.g. mouse models of influenza infection are almost universally Mx1-/- models. it is likely that there are specific alleles influencing disease processes that only act in the context of the presence or absence of major resistance alleles. to address this issue, we conducted further genome mapping while accounting for Mx1 status using two complementary approaches. a variety of studies have used transcriptional data [42], [49] to narrow QTL regions into candidate genes. but transcriptional analysis can be confounded by the dynamic nature of transcriptional responses, and can also be confounded by SNPs residing underneath the expression probes that can impact binding. pre-CC experiment also allowed us to identify specific CC lines that might be useful models for specific disease phenotypes. this suggests that while hemorrhage indicates a severe response to influenza infection, hemorrhage is governed by processes that are disassociated from those processes contributing to overall severity of infection. a number of groups have focused on identifying markers associated with different disease states (e.g. protective vaccine responses, asymptomatic individuals) the pre-CC study will provide the opportunity for identification of molecular signatures of different disease-associated phenotypes. findings also provide new insights into the relative contribution of viral replication versus virus-induced inflammation. both viral replication and levels of inflammation together were better predictors of disease outcome than either was alone. CC lines showed high levels of replication and weight loss, but low viral titers suggesting multiple pathways can lead to similar clinical disease outcomes across a genetically diverse population. GWAS of responses to acute infectious diseases has been difficult to conduct. the pre-CC population provided the appropriate framework to develop the methodological approaches that resulted in the identification and prioritization of genes within novel disease loci. this results strongly support the hypothesis that studies using fully inbred CC lines will be even more successful in identifying polymorphic genes that regulate multiple disease associated phenotypes including those associated with adaptive immune responses. functional Mx1 alleles reduced viral titers, weight loss and clinical disease, inflammation and pathology. it is unlikely a direct transcriptional regulator, but its potent ability to inhibit IAV replication likely alters the signaling environments and host response pathways triggered in response to infection. new studies are needed to better define whether the differential effect of the CAST/EiJ Mx1 allele are due to Mx1-associated signaling or more subtle effects on viral replication which subsequently affect inflammation and disease. this lack of structure across the genomes also allowed us to gain new insight into the relationships between coexpressed transcripts and disease outcomes. many studies of these pathogens have been conducted within susceptible models. it is likely that there are specific alleles influencing disease processes that only act in the context of the presence or absence of major resistance alleles. to address this issue, we conducted further genome mapping while accounting for Mx1 status using two complementary approaches. this result is unsurprising given the differences in virus strains, phenotypes measured, and polymorphisms within the two panels. the aggregate of these studies further strengthen the idea that virus-host interactions are highly complex, and that polymorphic host genes are critical for numerous responses. phenotypic variation across the population requires more intensive sequencing efforts on a case-by-case basis. the results suggest that in addition to the processed lists of SNPs and in/dels available at the Mouse Genome Projects from the Sanger Institute, the analysis of the allele effect should be analyzed. a number of groups have focused on identifying markers associated with different disease states (e.g. protective vaccine responses, asymptomatic individuals) the pre-CC study will provide the opportunity for identification of molecular signatures of different disease-associated phenotypes. findings also provide new insights into the relative contribution of viral replication versus virus-induced inflammation in the pathogenesis of influenza infection. viral replication and levels of inflammation were predictive of disease outcome independently of one another. CC lines showed high levels of replication and weight loss. but low viral titers suggesting multiple pathways can lead to similar clinical disease outcomes across a genetically diverse population. we provide proof of concept and a framework for identifying the role of polymorphic genes on microbial pathogenesis using a genetically diverse population. this study shows that a genetically complex in vivo model represents a useful system for modeling pathogen interactions within genetically diverse populations and identifying novel genetic loci controlling multiple aspects of disease pathogenesis. all studies were performed in a manner designed to minimize pain and suffering in infected animals. any animals that exhibited severe disease signs was euthanized immediately in accordance with approved endpoints. TCID50 assay MDCK cells were seeded into 96 well plates at a density of 1.5105 cells/well in DMEM. cells were washed 2 times with PBS, before adding 100 L of DMEM to each well. serial dilutions of 46 L (0.5 log dilutions) were carried out across the plate. two 5 micron thick Hematoxylin and Eosin stained lung sections were blind-scored by microscopic evaluation. the extent of influenza viral antigen spread across these slides was then scored in a blinded fashion on a 0\u20133 scale. individual cRNA samples were hybridized to Agilent mouse whole-genome oligonucleotide 444 microarrays according to manufacturer instructions. slides were scanned with an Agilent DNA microarray scanner. the images were then loaded into a custom-designed laboratory information management system. al expression analysis was performed using the LIMMA Bioconductor package [88] and the false discovery rate was calculated using the qvalue Bioconductor package [89] there were 11,700 probes passing QC and not potentially impacted by a SNP. only the Biological Process subset of the Gene Ontology was used for testing. module eigengene was compared to the mean topological overlap of 10,000 random modules of the same size chosen from the initial set of 6,000 probes. each eigengene was regressed on the expected haplotype contribution from each of the eight founding inbred strains. genome scans were run using the BAGPIPE package [101] to regress each phenotype on the computed haplotypes in the interval between adjacent genotype markers. a gene-wide significance was determined by permutation test, with 250 permutations conducted per scan. a more complex model was also used to control for Mx1 status. we identified all annotated genes and non-coding RNAs within 500 bases of, or in consistent regions. we combined data from the mouse genome assembly, the Sanger Institute's Mouse Genomes sequencing project and a mouse full-length Mx1 cDNA clone. mice were bred at UNC Chapel Hill under specific pathogen free conditions. adapted influenza A strain A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) was used for all infection studies. animals were lightly anesthetized via inhalation with Isoflurane (Piramal, Bethlehem, Pa) after anesthesia, animals were infected intranasally with 5102 pfu of PR8 in 50 L of phosphate buffered saline (PBS), while mock infected animals received only 50 L of PBS. animals were assayed daily for morbidity (determined as % weight loss), mortality and clinical disease scores Xp is the last dilution where all of the replicates of a given sample are positive, D is the serial dilution log and Sp is the sum of the proportion of replicates at all dilutions where positives are seen. the right lung was removed and submerged in 10% buffered formalin (Fischer) without inflation for 1 week. BALB/c mice and mouse IgG2a isotype antibody (R&D) were used as negative controls. mice were killed and lung tissue harvested and stored at 80\u00b0. cRNA samples were spectroscopically verified for purity. differential expression analysis was performed using the LIMMA Bioconductor package [88] and the false discovery rate was calculated using the qvalue Bioconductor package [89] there were 11,700 probes passing QC and not potentially impacted by a SNP. module formation was carried out using the dynamicTreeCut R package [96] with pruning carried out based only on the dendrogram. all modules were checked for statistical significance through a permutation procedure. each eigengene was regressed on the expected haplotype contribution. gene was genotyped using mouse diversity [47] test A-array at 181,752 well performing SNPs which were polymorphic across the founder strains. genetic map positions were computed for all genotyped loci using the integrated mouse genetic map using mouse genome build 37 [100] the deletion occurs between positions 97674078 and 97674079 of the reference on chromosome 10. the deletion occurs between positions 97674078 and 97674079 of the reference on chromosome 10. n = 5\u201312 animals from each of the eight founder strains had their weights recorded through four days post infection. the high variation present within NOD/ShiLtJ and CAST/EiJ was due to bimodal weight loss responses in each strain. QTL scans within the Mx1 -/- subpopulation (light grey line) identified a QTL, HrI3 on chromosome 1 influencing pulmonary edema that was not detectable within the whole pre-CC population (black line) phenotype by haplotype plot (C) showing the pulmonary edema score for those animals that were homozygous for founder strain alleles at HrI3 (A/J = yellow, C57BL/6J = grey, 129S1/SvImJ = pink, NOD/ShiLtJ = dk. blue, NZO/HILtJ = lt. blue, CAST/EiJ = green, PWK/Ph (16.4KB, docx) Table S2 Phenotypic correlations across the pre-CC population.
