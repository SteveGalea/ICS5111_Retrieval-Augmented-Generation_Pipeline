{"summary": "betacoronaviruses limit host translation using virus-encoded nsp1 (2\u20134). nsp1 of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) inhibits host translation. nsp1 counteracts the innate immune response. nsp1 proteins from alpha- and betacoronaviruses exhibit remarkably similar biological functions. they are different in size and lack significant similarity in protein sequence (15, 16) of the four coronavirus genera, only alpha- and betacoronaviruses encode nsp1 (17\u201320) this observation has prompted the question of whether gamma- and deltacoronaviruses inhibit translation of host proteins. chicken embryo kidney cells were seeded at 4 105 cells/cm2 in 199 medium (Invitrogen) all cells were incubated in a humidified incubator at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. a cell suspension was obtained by trypsinization for 30 min. RVFV Cl13 was amplified and titrated on vero cells. total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen) gene expression ratios were normalized using an external reference gene (luciferase) gene. luciferase gene expression ratios were normalized using an external reference gene.

RESULTS IBV inhibits production of type I IFN. primary CEK cells were infected with IBV, RVFV Cl13, or SinV. RESULTS IFN inhibits production of type I IFN. a concentration of 1,000 U/ml was detected in the supernatant of cells infected with IBV strains M41, It02, QX, and 4/91. the titer of the cell culture-adapted Beau-R strain was higher than those of the other IBV strains. this could explain why Beau-R induced higher production of IFN. mRNA levels for most genes decreased between 30 and 90% in both IBV-infected and noninfected cells. mRNA levels for most genes decreased between 30 and 90% in both IBV-infected and noninfected cells. no evidence was found to support the hypothesis that IBV infection decreases the stability of host mRNAs. degradation of host mRNA is most likely not the mechanism by which inhibition of host protein synthesis occurs. accessory protein 5b inhibits synthesis of host proteins. gammacoronaviruses does not encode an nsp1 homologue. another viral protein must be responsible for inhibition of host protein synthesis. DF-1 (B) and Vero (C) cells were seeded in 96-well plates and transfected with 10 ng Renilla luciferase-expressing plasmid plus 90 ng of plasmid expressing the indicated accessory protein of Beau-R or MHV nsp1 or empty plasmid. at 18 h posttransfection, luciferase activity was quantified, and it is plotted on the left y axi we quantified the 35S signal of the spike (S), nucleocapsid (N) and membrane (M) proteins of IBV and found synthesis of these proteins to be comparable in all the viruses. accessory protein 5b is required for inhibition of host protein synthesis by IBV. asterisks indicate significant differences (P 0.001) compared to mock infection. we quantified the production of type I IFN by DF-1 cells infected with Beau-R or accessory-gene-null mutant virus. accessory protein 5b plays a major role in the inhibition of general host protein synthesis, thereby inhibiting production of IFN by IBV-infected cells. DF-1 (A) and CEK (B to D) cells were infected (MOI, 0.1) with Beau-R. supernatant of IBV-infected cells contained almost no IFN. cytopathic effect (CPE) was extensive at 24 hpi. no IFN protein was detected in the cell culture supernatant. Ifn mRNA (A), extracellular IFN protein (B) and total viral RNA (C) were quantified. the values represent the results of one experiment, which was performed twice. IBV inhibits translation of host proteins. we quantified mRNA and calculated the percentage of mRNA that remained after 6 h of treatment with ActD. the percentage of mRNA that remains after ActD treatment is a function of the stability of that specific mRNA and the duration of the treatment. luciferase activity was quantified at 22 hpi. bars represent mean luciferase activities of triplicate measurements. asterisks indicate statistically significant differences. the only plasmids that significantly reduced luciferase expression in both DF-1 and vero cells were those encoding accessory protein 5b of IBV and nsp1 of MHV. the reduction was not due to cytotoxic effects of either the transfection procedure or the plasmids. de novo protein synthesis was measured using 35S pulse-labeling at 6, 12, and 24 hpi. the results indicated that all the viruses except ScAUG5b and ScAUG5ab decreased translation of host proteins at both 12 and 24 hpi. area containing host proteins labeled H1 to H3. synthesis of IBV proteins was approximated by quantification of 35S signal intensities. asterisks indicate significant differences compared to mock infection. both ScAUG5b- and ScAUG5ab-infected cells produced up to 15 times more IFN than Beau-R-infected cells. levels of Ifn mRNA were significantly higher in cells infected with any of the accessory-gene-null viruses. only in 5b mutant cells were increased IFN protein levels detected. alpha- and betacoronaviruses have evolved multiple mechanisms to delay and antagonize coronavirus infection in vivo. alpha- and betacoronaviruses inhibit production of host proteins, including type I IFN, via the viral nsp1 protein (2\u20134, 7) a subset of mRNAs were recruited to structures such as stress granules (SG) during IBV infection a subset of mRNAs are recruited to structures such as stress granules (SG) stress granules (SG) are temporary repositories of mRNAs, and formed in response to stress-induced translational arrest (35, 36) the genomes of gamma- and deltacoronaviruses do not encode nsp1. it is unclear which IBV protein could play a role in host shutoff. a previous study showed that absence of IBV accessory protein 3b increases production of type I interferon protein late (36 hpi) during infection. we then examined whether inhibition of host protein synthesis by 5b is responsible for the block in IFN production observed in IBV-infected chicken cells. the extent of the difference in IFN production is comparable to previous observations of SARS-CoV nsp1 mutant virus (9). the functional resemblance between 5b and nsp1 prompted us to compare the two proteins. 5b can be translated only from subgenomic viral RNAs that are produced only later during infection. this may indicate that inhibition of host protein synthesis during the initial stages of infection may not be required for the Gammacoronavirus IBV."}
