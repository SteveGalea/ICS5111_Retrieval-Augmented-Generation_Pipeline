{"summary": "retroviruses are characterized by a unique replication strategy involving conversion of the viral RNA genome into double-stranded DNA by the virus-encoded reverse transcriptase. retroviruses can have either simple or complex genomes and are classified into the Orthoretrovirinae subfamily, comprising the genera Alpharetrovirus, Betaretrovirus, Deltaretrovirus, Epsilonretrovirus, and Lentivirus. bats are known to harbor more than 60 distinct viruses, including representatives from the Rhabdoviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Coronaviridae, Togaviridae, Flaviviridae, Reoviridae, Arenaviridae, Herpesviridae, and Filoviridae families. it is possible that bats may represent hosts for diverse gammaretroviruses. all products were purified and enriched by PCR to create the final cDNA library that was sequenced on the Illumina sequencing platform (GAII) the resulting raw reads were assembled into sequence contigs using the Bruijn graph and SOAPdenovo software (29) PCR was performed using exTaq DNA polymerase (TaKaRa) all PCR products were ligated into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) and transformed into Escherichia coli for plasmid amplification and purification. the universal T7 (5\u2032-TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GG-3\u2032) and SP6 (5\u2032-ATT TAG GTG ACA CTA TAG-3\u2032) sequencing primer first round PCR used nested primers 5-race-4 (5\u2032-CCT ACT GGC TTC CCC TCC ACA TAC G-3\u2032) and UPM (nested universal primer mix) for second-round PCR, the 3-race-3 (5\u2032-GTC AGG GTT AAC AGC CCC TAG CCT G-3\u2032) and NUP (nested universal primer A) were used for the first round. gamma-Gag1-forward (5\u2032-CCC ACC AAT TTG GCC/T AAG GTA A-3\u2032; positions 1755 to 1776 in RfRV) and the reverse primers gamma-Gag1-reverse (5\u2032-CTG C/TTG GCA ATC ATC CCA AGT GG-3\u2032; positions 1507 to 1529 in RfRV) all of the bat-derived gammaretroviral sequences the sequences of two major proteins (Gag and Pol) of each gammaretrovirus were retrieved from GenBank. the sequences of two major proteins (Gag and Pol) of each gammaretrovirus were retrieved from GenBank. all of the sequences, together with that of RfRV, were aligned in MUSCLE 3.7 (14) and checked manually in Se-Al (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/seal/). evolutionary history of these viruses was then inferred using the maximum-likelihood method in PhyML 3.0 (17) the whole-brain tissue of Rhinolophus ferrumequinum was processed immediately after necropsy. the total RNA was isolated using the SV total RNA isolation system (Promega) all products were purified and enriched by PCR to create the final cDNA library that was sequenced on the Illumina sequencing platform. three pairs of primers were designed to amplify 4,516 nucleotides (nt) of the RfRV sequence. included partial gag, complete pol, and partial env. all PCR products were ligated into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) the complete genome of R. ferrumequinum gammaretrovirus was deposited in GenBank under the accession number JQ303225. the complete genome of R. ferrumequinum gammaretrovirus (RfRV) was deposited under the accession number JQ303225. two to three animals were analyzed for each species. RT-PCR was used according to the method described above. sequences of two major proteins (Gag and Pol) of each gammaretrovirus were retrieved from GenBank (abbreviation; accession number; GenBank accession number). sequences of two major proteins (Gag and Pol) of each gammaretrovirus were retrieved from GenBank. murine type C retrovirus (M-CRV; NC_001702, host pig), porcine endogenous retrovirus class A (PERV-A; AJ293656, host pig), porcine endogenous retrovirus B (PERV-C; EF133960, host pig), RD114 retrovirus (RD114; NC_009889, host cat), Mus dunni endogenous virus (MDEV; AF053745, host koala), or a single optimal reconstruction was found with the heuristic search option. the significance of the observed fit between the bat retroviruses and their hosts was determined by comparison with the distribution of the same measure of fit. the complete RfRV genome was 8,356 nt, comprising the gag (nucleotide positions 621 to 2348), pol (nt 2349 to 5594), and env (nt 5990 to 7867) a predicted 645-nt ORF (ORF x, positions 5425 to 6069) encoding a partial integrase sequence overlaps the 3\u2032 end of pol. phylogenetic analysis placed RfRV at the base of the phylogenetic tree of known mammalian isolates. a bootstrap test with 1,000 replicates was used to determine the robustness. the inability to amplify retroviral sequences from four bat species may be due to the absence of retroviral infection in the two to three animals sampled from each of these four species. a conserved region of the partial Pol protein sequence was used to infer a phylogenetic tree. there is no statistically significant evidence for codivergence across the data set as a whole (P = 0.366), and instances of cross-species transmission are evident. however, after the collapsing RpeRV node, we observed significantly more similarity in the virus and host trees than expected by chance alone (P = 0.045) a tRNAPro primer-binding site (PBS) is present (nucleotide positions 152 to 173) a unique untranslated region (U5) in between R and the PBS could not be identified. a predicted 645-nt open reading frame (ORF; ORF x, at nt 5425 to 6069) encoding a partial integrase sequence overlaps the 3\u2032 end of pol. the retroviral pol gene, encoding the reverse transcriptase, is highly conserved. phylogenetic analysis placed RfRV at the base of the phylogenetic tree of known mammalian isolates. the tree is midpoint rooted for purposes of clarity only. bat gammaretrovirus is highlighted in red. branch lengths are drawn to a scale of amino acid substitutions per site. the tree is midpoint rooted for purposes of clarity only. bat gammaretroviruses were inferred using Pol amino acid sequences. the tree is midpoint rooted for purposes of clarity only. there is no statistically significant evidence for codivergence. seven bat species were found to harbor phylogenetically distant gammaretroviruses. lack of well-characterized bat genomes hinders our ability to determine time of invasion of these bat gammaretroviruses into the host genomes. however, larger numbers of sequences are needed to resolve evolutionary relationships between retroviruses harbored by megabats. our data show that bats carry a diverse array of mammalian gammaretroviruses. this finding is compatible with the idea that these arose in bats."}
