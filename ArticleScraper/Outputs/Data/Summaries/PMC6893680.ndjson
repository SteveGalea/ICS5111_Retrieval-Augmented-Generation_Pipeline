{"summary": "a representative mammal species of the order Pholidota is one of the only eight pangolin species worldwide. four of them are from Asia (M. javanica, M. pentadactyla, M. crassicaudata and M. culionensis), whereas another four from africa (M. tricuspis, M. tetradactyla, M. gigantea and M. temminckii) virologists use a variety of methods to gain understanding of infection, replication, pathogenicity, and, more recently, the evolution of the viral genome. virologists use a variety of methods to gain understanding of infection, replication, pathogenicity, and, more recently, the evolution of the viral genome. organ samples of lung, lymph, and spleen were collected from dead pangolins at the Guangdong Wildlife Rescue Center. a viral metagenomic study uncovered the virus diversity and molecular epidemiology of potential etiologies of viruses based on a viral metagenomic study. fragments of 350 bp were collected by beads after electrophoresis. libraries were pooled and subjected to 150 bp paired-end sequencing. high-throughput sequencing was conducted by the Magigene Company (Guangzhou, China) reads were classified into different virus families. a host sequence was determined based on BLAST version 2.7.1. a host sequence was determined based on BLAST version 2.7.1. FigTree version 1.4.3 was a vector diagram of all ML trees. the study design was approved by the ethics committee for animal experiments at the Guangdong Institute of Applied Biological Resources (GIABR20170720, 20 July 2017) libraries were pooled and subjected to 150 bp paired-end sequencing using the Novaseq 6000 platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) high-throughput sequencing was conducted by the Magigene Company (Guangzhou, China) clean reads without ribosomes and host sequences were mapped to an in-house virus reference data separate from the GenBank non-redundant nucleotide database. a host sequence was determined based on BLAST version 2.7.1. alignment similarity 80%, length of matched area 500 bp and e-value 105. contigs with significant BLASTx hits were confirmed as virus sequences. a total of 21 organ samples of lung, lymph and spleen from 11 dead Malayan pangolins were used to reveal viral diversity of pangolins. reads in each sample varied from 2856 to 78,052. the most widely distributed virus families were Herpesviridae and Paramyxoviridae. reads related to these families occupied 85% of total viral sequence reads. lung08 39,624,368 16,414,925 (41.43) 10,655,020 (64.91) 10,555,677 (64.31) 9139 (0.06) 2196 6969 300 514 50.72 lung09 42,219,253 18,067,615 (42.79) 11,552,994 (63.94) 11,442,175 (63.33) 13,146 (0.07) 4903 13,503 300 623 46.97 lung11 52,714,790 22,220,187 (42.15) 382 49.79 spleen02 35,359,899 15,350,468 (43.41) 9,888,746 (64.42) 9,739,169 (63.45) 7955 (0.05) 1857 6119 300 436 47.94 spleen03 34,350,848 19,055,973 (55.47) 11,356,082 (59.59) 11,244,710 (59.01) 5405 (0.03) 1194 4290 300 353 51.60 spleen rRNA clean: number and percentage of reads after removing host sequence; Virus reads: number of reads mapped to the virus database. 68 contigs were confirmed for virus species, accounting for 0.1% of total number of contigs. q Start q End s Start s End e-Value Bit Score lung01|contig_245 AB005795.1 90.15 2072 204 0 1060 3131 4378 6449 0.0 2818 lung01|contig_302 AB005795.1 86.03 594 83 0 207 800 1451 2044 0.0 697 lung01|contig_307 DQ219803.1 90.06 513 50 1 22 5 0.0 1757 lung07|contig_1426 AB005795.1 91.60 607 51 0 131 737 10,163 9557 0.0 865 lung09|contig_2947 DQ219803.1 91.74 1550 122 4 1 1547 13,835 15,381 0.0 2206 lung11|contig_5506 DQ219803.1 91.31 656 57 0 72 727 5180 5835 0.0 926 lung phylogenetic analysis revealed the closest relationship between the 13,232 bp length contig from Malayan pangolin and Sendai virus strains isolated from humans. the genetic distance between the Sendai virus from Malayan pangolin and humans (AB005795.1) was the closest (Figure 4); the same as the relationship between them generated based on whole genome sequences. whole genome sequences of strains belonging to four genera were downloaded from the ViPR database. together with 16 contigs confirmed as Coronavirus in this study, all the sequences were aligned using MAFFT version 7.427. the best substitution model analyzed by iqtree was GTR+F+R7. tig_715 AY394981.1 88.68 521 59 0 96 616 17,937 17,417 0.0 673 SARS coronavirus HGZ8L1-A lung07|contig_1748 DQ412042.1 87.84 584 71 0 46 629 11,919 12,502 0.0 733 Bat SARS CoV Rf1/2004 lung08|contig_223 KJ473814.1 85.52 2023 776 0.0 657 Bat coronavirus Cp/Yunnan2011 lung08|contig_1420 AY394981.1 88.39 646 75 0 1 646 17,333 17,978 0.0 827 SARS coronavirus HGZ8L1-A lung08|contig_1528 DQ412043.1 84.29 681 107 0 138 818 19,339 18,659 0.0 746 Bat SARS CoV Rm1/2004 sample ID Raw Reads (PE) Number of Reads Remaining after Filtering (%) Assembly Data on Filtered Reads Clean Reads (PE) Rm. rRNA Clean (PE) Virus Reads (PE) Total No. Max Len.
