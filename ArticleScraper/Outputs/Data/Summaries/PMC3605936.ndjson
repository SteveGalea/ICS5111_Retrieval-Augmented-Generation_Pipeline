{"summary": "airborne transport has been linked to the transmission of Coccidioides immitis(1); Mycobacterium tuberculosis(2); Legionella spp. (3); smallpox virus (4); and a variety of other pathogenic fungi, bacteria, and viruses (5\u20138) of importance to both human and animal health are major zoonotic pathogens transmitted via aerosols. dose-response curve depends on pathogen (21), strain or isolate of the pathogen (19), host species (22) and host factors, such as age and immune status (23). a larger challenge is the requirement to determine the dose of infectious pathogen to which the host was exposed. the continuous-stirred tank reactor (CSTR) is a vessel characterized by steady-state and uniform internal conditions due to mixing. the reactions and processes occurring within the CSTR may be defined for the conditions of the vessel. the concentration of a target within a CSTR can be predicted at any time (t) using the equation: Table I. a rotating dynamic aerosol toroid (DAT) housed in an environment that preserves the pathogen\u2019s infectivity is a CSTR. as such, the concentrations of the airborne components within the DAT can be predicted at time (t) if the exchange volumes are known. this paper provides experimental evidence to support this concept. the entire system was disassembled and cleaned between each of the 10 replicates. approximately 50 mL of a 1 phosphate buffered saline solution was nebulized into the DAT using a 24-jet Collison nebulizer. this parameters aerosolized the solution at a rate of 1.1 mL per min and produced particles 1.9 m in diameter. the amount of rhodamine B dye in each sample was measured using a fluorometer (Turner BioSystems) the results were expressed as raw fluorescence units. to predict the concentration of an airborne target (e.g., rhodamine B) within a CSTR as samples are drawn from the drum and replaced with filtered inlet air. Equation 4 states that the mass fraction of target in a perfectly mixed drum at any time (t) is a function of the initial concentration inside the drum and the exponential decay characterized by the mass of air inside the drum (ma) and the mass flow rate of air through the drum (ma) Equation 5 can be used to back-calculate the initial target mass fraction (t = 0) within the drum from the initial extracted sample (t = 1). Equation 6 represents the initial mass fraction inside the drum. the drum behaves as a well-mixed vessel. all subsequent sample extractions and resulting mass fractions will obey the mixing model as given in equation (5). amine B at (t = 0) Mc,out(t) = rhodamine B concentration at current time Vextracted = the running total of the volume removed Vdrum = the total volume in container e = the base of natural logarithm (Euler\u2019s number). the slope of the rhodamine B regression line was equal to (log10e/Vdrum) the linear regression line explained 93% of the variation in log10 transformed rhodamine B data. the average slope of the 9 runs was not significantly different from the theoretical slope (0.0011) the linear relationship between log10Mc,out(t) and Vextracted may be used to estimate the concentration of an airborne target in a DAT given known exchange volumes. a tracer was used to model the behavior of an aerosolized pathogen in a rotating DAT. this experiment was conducted in a 400 L DAT rotated at 4 RPM. however, a variety of DAT sizes and rotation speeds are reported in the literature. a review of the literature found no evaluation of the effect of DAT dimensions, volume, and rate of rotation on the behavior of suspended particles. the environmental conditions were designed to preserve target pathogen infectivity. at temperatures above freezing, the slope of the airborne pathogen would diverge from the slope of the rhodamine B."}
