{"summary": "the lebanese population increased by 30% due to the influx of Syrian refugees. a sudden increase of such magnitude represents a shock to the health system. but it also offers a unique opportunity to study resilience of a health system. the indicators used in these earlier studies are in line with the definition of resilience we have used. this definition stresses the ability of a system to reorganize and adapt to change while maintaining original functions and ensuring long\u2013term sustainability [26\u201328]. the number of nurses working in lebanese health system increased steadily and was not affected by the Syrian crisis [34]. the steady rate of increase in nurses occurred as a result of deliberate MOPH policies, such as the establishment of a career path for nurses. despite financial constraints, the MOPH managed to uphold and improve its contracting terms with private hospitals. all the public funds and private insurance companies continued to provide cover to their respective beneficiaries, notwithstanding delays in reimbursement. despite financial constraints, the MOPH managed to increase its expenditure on drugs. response including MOPH, UN agencies, international and local non\u2013governmental organisations (NGOs) set up yearly response plans such as the \u201cLebanon crisis response plan\u201d these plans detailed all funding sources, activities performed and coordination efforts. the results were shared in dissemination workshops and on the websites of these partners. the inclusive model of governance was critical in mounting an effective emergency response and in creating health system resilience. health programmes, such as those for epidemiological surveillance, immunization, medication for chronic illnesses, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and reproductive health, are functioning effectively. national vaccination campaigns for polio and measles have been routinely conducted as needed, and services provided to all those in Lebanonirrespective of nationalities. since 2013, the number of primary health care centers in the national network exceeded 1.2 million, compared to about 700 000 in 2009. in 2014, the total beneficiaries of the primary health care network exceeded 1.2 million, compared to about 700 000 in 2009 [38]. infant mortality rate (IMR) fell sharply from 33.5 per 1000 live births in 1996 to 8 per 1000 live births. under 5 Mortality rate (U5MR) declined from 36.5 per 1000 live births in 1996 to 9 per 1000 live births in 2013. the maternal mortality ratio decreased from 140 per 100 000 live births in 1990 to 16 in 2013. cholera was considered a public health threat in Lebanon by WHO due to the refugee crisis. in 2012, the case notification rate increased by 27%, however. this increase was attributed to a rapid rise in the number of Syrian refugees. spending on health, the budget of the MOPH, and all public funds rose at the same rate of yearly increase as in the preceding years. however, throughout the crisis, the levels of funding from international donors were erratic and far below the amounts required to meet the health needs of the refugees. despite financial constraints, the MOPH managed to increase its expenditure on drugs. the MOPH began to offer displaced Syrians the same immunization and schedule primary health care services offered to lebanese citizens. the parallel systems established by international agencies led to fragmentation and poor coordination of the health system response. the MOPH established a steering committee that includes major international and local partners to guide the response. 92 new staff were recruited in PHC, in dispensaries\u2019 and in public hospitals. this number diminished gradually to 42 by the end of 2015. each program approached the crisis as if they were dealing with an enlarged population. health workers, including volunteers from universities and schools, participated in the door\u2013to\u2013door immunization campaigns. the epidemiological surveillance program was able to sustain and even enhance its functions, including measurement and monitoring disease burden, detecting outbreaks, investigating emerging infections and implementing early warning and response system. vaccination rates for measles and diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus (DPT) are considered important indicators of health system performance. the vaccination campaigns achieved high vaccination rates for both lebanese and Syrian beneficiaries [38]. in 2013, the number of reported measles cases was 1760, compared to 29 cases in 2015. the spread of leishmaniasis was also avoided despite the presence of its vector, the sand fly, in north Lebanon and the bekaa. only three lebanese citizens contracted the disease during the crisis. the health system in Lebanon was able to maintain service delivery for both refugees and Lebanese citizens. the resilience of health care service delivery in Lebanon could be attributed to four major factors. a comprehensive communicable disease response helped combat outbreaks, a major health priority during a refugee crisis [48]. a comprehensive communicable disease response helped combat outbreaks, a major health priority during a refugee crisis [48]. a comprehensive communicable disease response helped combat outbreaks. a revised definition of resilience describes a real life and tested experience of resilience in an unprecedented setting. we identified four major factors that enabled resilience: (i) networking with stakeholders (ii) diversification of the health system that provided adequate infrastructure and health human resources (iii) a comprehensive communicable disease response and (iv) the integration of refugees into the health system. health system has shown resilience in spite of the most severe refugee crisis of recent times experienced anywhere in the world."}
