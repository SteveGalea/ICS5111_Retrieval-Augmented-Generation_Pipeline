{"summary": "MERS-CoV was isolated from a patient with a fatal case of pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia. a cluster of cases in the UK in February of 2013 suggested human-to-human transmission in two cases with no travel history to the Middle East. it is currently unclear whether human cases were a result of direct zoonotic transmission from this reservoir to humans. all animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Rocky Mountain Laboratories. the work with infectious MERS-CoV was approved under BSL3 conditions by the Institutional Biosafety Committee. one group received 103 TCID50 intratracheally in a total volume of 300 l. one group received 106 TCID50 intratracheally in a total volume of 300 l. eight hamsters in each group and eight control hamsters (4 intratracheal and 4 aerosol) were injected with an IPTT-300 temperature transponder to monitor body temperature daily. the contents of the aerosol exposure were collected in an All Glass Impinger (AGI, Ace Glass Inc., NJ, USA) operating at 7.5 lpm (25-30 PSI) both generator and sampler were flow checked using a frictionless bubble meter. in between aerosol runs a period of 5 minutes allowed the particles from the previous run to settle. immunohistochemistry was performed on lungs, kidney, small intestine, urinary bladder and colon of normal hamsters using an -DPP4 antibody (-CD26; 1:800; Abcam) the tissues were processed for immunohistochemistry using the Discovery XT automated processor (Ventana Medical Systems) RNA extraction was performed using the NucleoSpin 96 Virus Core kit (Macherey-Nagel) HCoV-EMC/2012 containing cell culture supernatant was concentrated and purified by spinning two hours at 21000 rpm over a 15% OptiPrep cushion. the pellet was resuspended in PBS and triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1%. suspension was then gamma-irradiated before removal from high containment. the first group was inoculated intratracheally with 103 TCID50 of HCoV-EMC/2012. the second group was inoculated intratracheally with 106 TCID50 of HCoV-EMC/2012. the third group was inoculated with 4x102 TCID50 HCoV-EMC/2012 via aerosolization. hamsters were mock inoculated (A and E), inoculated intratracheally with 103 TCID50 HCoV-EMC/2012 (B and F), inoculated intratracheally with 106 TCID50 HCoV-EMC/2012 (C and G) or inoculated with 4x102 TCID50 via aerosols (D and H) were measured. average and standard error of the mean are plotted for 8 animals per hamster sera collected on 21 dpi were analyzed for the presence of antibodies. there was no evidence for seroconversion in any of the inoculated animals. the MERS-CoV does not replicate in Syrian hamsters. qRT-PCR assay to detect Mx2 was performed on RNA isolated from lungs, spleen and mandibular lymph nodes. data were calculated from 4 mock animals and 4 (2 dpi) or 8 (4 and 8 dpi) inoculated animals. animal model provides insight into the potential host range of this virus. the search for an animal infection/disease model is of utmost importance."}
