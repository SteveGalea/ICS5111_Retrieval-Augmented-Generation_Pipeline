{"summary": "MERS-CoV was first identified in a patient from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in June 2012. the case involved a man in Saudi Arabia who was admitted to the hospital with pneumonia and acute kidney injury. the virus was later isolated from the patient\u2019s sputum. ERS-CoV descends from the 2C beta-coronavirus lineage existing in humans and camels. it is separate from other human beta-coronaviruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus. but it is similarly associated with few bat coronaviruses. PP4 is expressed in the upper respiratory tract of camels. in humans it is solely expressed in the lower respiratory tract. this is due to the fact that coV have the potential to recombine, mutate and jump between animals. the genome of MERS-CoV contains 30,119 nucleotides and a minimum of 10 predicted open reading frames. the 3\u2032 end encodes structural proteins, including spike (S), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N), envelope (E) and various accessory proteins such as 3, 4a, 4b, 5 and 8b. four separate human coronavirus (hCoV) genera circulate the globe. some are promoters of the common cold, with an additional hCoV being SARS-CoV that caused an outbreak in 2003.1. two cases of severe hCoV infection were notified, and were caused by a novel virus type. in the middle east, the number of cases has significantly increased during March and April 2014. there has been a notable outbreak of 186 confirmed cases across 16 hospitals present in south Korea in the period of May and June 2015 from an index case. the current upsurge in the number of infected patients is due to enhanced case detection and active surveillance programs. serological studies were performed in Saudi Arabia from 2010 to 2013, and in 2014, where sera from sheep, goats, cattle, and chickens from various geographical areas within the country were collected. indigenous camels were mixed with imported camels from Sudan and Somalia. local camels showed significantly higher rates of infection with MERS-CoV than those imported. however, since its presence in the 1980s, high seropositivity against the virus indicates that the virus has circulated in camels prior to being introduced to the human population. infected people, MERS-CoV causes a range of illnesses from asymptomatic to acute respiratory illness with mild to severe respiratory courses and death. it is suggested to use q-PCR for targeting the region upstream of the envelope gene as a screening assay. three cases of MERS-CoV reported onset with widespread bilateral hyperintense lesions via T2WI MRI. a high risk of severe course of MERS-CoV infection is seen in patients with comorbid conditions, such as diabetes, renal, cardiac and chronic pulmonary disease, cancer. virology and pathogenesis MERS-CoV belongs to the family Coronaviridae. it has a large RNA viral genome of approximately 26-33 kb and G+C contents varying from 32 to 43%. MERS-CoV causes disease of the lower respiratory tract and can be found in tracheal aspirates, sputum, or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of symptomatic patients. viral shedding from nasal secretions, sneezing, coughing and sputum can be continuous up to six weeks, which builds concerns that asymptomatic individuals could also transmit the infection to others. the genome of MERS-CoV contains 30,119 nucleotides and a minimum of 10 predicted open reading frames. the 3\u2032 end encodes structural proteins, including spike (S), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N), envelope (E), and various accessory proteins. nine sites in the S protein of MERS-CoV have been found to have significant positive selection. this entails that the S protein has encountered strong evolutionary pressure during its transmission from its natural host to humans. six of these positively selected sites occupy the RBD. two positive cases of MERS-CoV have been reported in Lebanon so far. a lebanese 60-year-old healthcare worker tested positive for MERS-CoV. the patient developed gastrointestinal symptoms, diagnosis confirmed pneumonia, and the following day he tested positive for MERS-CoV. approximately 64% cases are male with a median age of 48 years. a seasonal pattern of cases has been observed, with a peak each year between April and June. dromedaries eliminated through sneezing and coughing are primary spreading mechanisms in zoonotic and inter-human transmissions. MERS-CoV is closely associated with coronaviruses found in bats, suggesting that bats may be a reservoir of MERS-CoV. emergence of intensive camel livestock system and large trade between countries, particularly from Somalia to Gulf regions, can significantly contribute to multiple disease transmissions. around one third of patients with MERS have died; however, mild cases of MERS-CoV may have been missed by the current surveillance techniques. three cases of MERS-CoV reported onset with widespread bilateral hyperintense lesions via T2WI MRI. a high risk of severe course of MERS-CoV infection is seen in patients with comorbid conditions, such as diabetes, renal, cardiac and chronic pulmonary disease, cancer. administration of both ribavirin and interferon-2b may decrease viral load. it is hypothesized that DPP4 inhibitors may restrain viral replication. a candidate DNA vaccine developed from MERS-Cov spike protein subunit 1 (S1) is under investigation. dromedaries are primary hosts of MERS-CoV, their vaccination would decrease the risk of zoonotic transmission. surveillance particularly towards wildlife is essential, and considerable gaps in the knowledge of MERS-CoV demands better case definitions. if vaccination becomes available, it should primarily begin with camel handlers, healthcare workers and veterinarians. dromedaries are primary hosts of MERS-CoV, their vaccination would decrease the risk of zoonotic transmission. surveillance particularly towards wildlife is essential, and considerable gaps in the knowledge of MERS-CoV demands better case definitions. vaccination should begin with camel handlers, healthcare workers and veterinarians."}
