{"summary": "control of translation and turnover of mRNAs plays fundamental roles in regulation of gene expression. RNA viruses have evolved mechanisms to modulate the assembly of different RNA granules. stress granules (SGs), processing bodies (P-bodies or PBs) and neuronal granules are associated with mRNA storage and decay. the formation of SGs in response to chemotherapeutic treatments may promote several neurodegenerative disorders, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and spinal muscular atrophy. the formation of SGs in response to chemotherapeutic treatments has also been associated with cancer cell survival [3]. PBs are constitutively present and respond to stimuli that affect mRNA translation and decay. emetine and cycloheximide, drugs that stabilize polysomes, dissolve both SGs and PBs. puromycin promotes their assembly. PBs contain components of the mRNA decapping machinery (Dcp1/2, Lsm1-7, Edc3proteins) [40,41], scaffolding proteins (Ge-1/Hedls) [41], deadenylation factors (Ccr1, Caf1, Not1) [42], nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) proteins (SMG5-6-7, UPF1) [45,43] and translation control factors (CPEB, eIF4E-T) [ SG Component Reference ADAR [38,50] MEX67 [51] AKAP350 [52] MLN51 [53] ANG [54] MSI1 [55] ATXN2/pbp1 [56,57] mTOR [37,58] CALR [59] OGFOD1 [60] Caprin1 [61] P97/NAT1 [62] CCAR1 [52] PABP1 [30] CIRP [63] CUGBP hnRNP K [76] TFEB [90] Hsp27 [91] TRAF2 [92] HuD [93] USP10 [21,94] HuR [95] Vinexin [96] IFIH1/ MDA-5 [38,50] ZBP-1 [97] IP5K [98] KHC/KLC [68] LINE1 ORF1p [99] MBNL1 [67] PB Component Reference Ccr4 [100] PB Components SGs are composed of target mRNAs bound to translation initiation factors (eIF4G, eIF3, PABPC1, eIF2-P, eIF5A) to allow the rapid restoration of translation once the stress is gone. many other proteins are involved in SG formation. GW-bodies contain GW182, a large scaffolding protein containing an N-terminal domain composed of GW/WG motifs. the N-terminal GW/WG motif-bearing domain has been shown to bind to AGO2 while the C-terminus interacts with the CCR4-NOT deadenylation complex.

TIA-1 and TIAR were recruited to sites of tick-borne encephalitis virus replication. eIF2 becomes phosphorylated, and eIF3 and eIF4B are induced in TBEV-infected cells. infection with bovine viral diarrhea virus impairs the arsenite-mediated SG assembly. HCV modulates the SG assembly by controlling the phosphorylation of eIF2. SG assembly is regulated by dsRNA promoting phosphorylation of eIF2 mediated by PKR. SG disassembly is regulated by a rapid eIF2 dephosphorylation. the hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) induce TIA-1/TIAR aggregates with a concomitant increase in eIF2 phosphorylation levels. MHV promotes SG assembly at early times post-infection, while TGEV induces SG assembly at later times post-infection [186]. virus suppresses the assembly of SG during viral infection by expressing the non-structural protein NS1 which inhibits PKR activity. NS1-mediated inhibition of SG assembly is dependent on the interaction with the RNA-associated protein 55 (RAP55). DDX3 has been implicated in the sensing of viral RNA to modulate IFN production and SG assembly. JUNV is a virus belonging to Arenaviridae, a family of enveloped virions. the virus prevents SG assembly by impairing the phosphorylation of eIF2 [193], while the expression of JUNV nucleoprotein (N) and/or the glycoprotein precursor (GPC) are enough to inhibit SG assembly [193], suggesting a role of the SG component in the viral replication cycle. measles virus (MeV) has the capacity to affect the innate and adaptive immune response through the accessory viral proteins V and C. wild-type MeV induces the assembly of SGs in ADAR1-knockdown cells, suggesting a role between the viral C protein and ADAR1. tide is scavenged from host mRNAs to initiate its own mRNA synthesis. the viral N protein binds to cap structures of cellular mRNAs. the endonuclease domain of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) cleaves cap-downstream sequences in a range of 10\u201318 ribonucleotides. bunyaviruses use complex mechanisms of transcription/translation that are potentially interconnected with cytoplasmic RNA granules. studies with orthobunyaviruses, Hantaviruses and Phleboviruses have shown that the non-structural protein from the S segment acts as an inhibitor of the IFN response. andes Hantavirus (ANDV) inhibits PKR dimerization, impairing its activation. RVFV infection promotes a shut-off of global translation, where NSs protein mediate PKR degradation by the proteasome. human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) significantly impairs SG assembly in favor of the assembly of Staufen1-containing HIV-1-dependent ribonucleoproteins. we also reported that HIV-1 Gag mediates the disassembly of preexisting SGs via an interaction with G3BP1 [229]. in HIV-1-expressing cells, Gag interacts with eIF4E, reducing hypophosphorylated 4EBP1 associated with the 5\u2032 cap in order to promote the disassembly of SGs. the replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) induces the spontaneous assembly of SG [231]. cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection suppresses the assembly of SGs in cells treated with the ER stressor thapsigargin. inducing eIF2 phosphorylation, SG assembly is not induced. eIF2 phosphorylation to maintain viral RNA translation is likely due to the translocation of PABP from rotavirus. the persistent phosphorylation of eIF2 during rotavirus infection is PKR-dependent. despite high levels of phosphorylated eIF2, SGs are disrupted at later times during MRV infection. theiler murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) and mengovirus, a strain of EMCV, inhibit SG assembly through the expression of the leader (L) protein. a mutant mengovirus induces G3BP1 aggregation in a PKR-dependent manner. this suggests that a G3BP1-Caprin1-PKR complex could induce innate immune activation during mengovirus infection. rubella virus induces G3BP1 aggregates that colocalize with viral ssRNA and non-structural viral protein P150. the infection with Sindbis virus induces the assembly of G3BP1 aggregates, which interact with nsP2, nsP3 and nsP4 [165] TIA-1, TIAR and TIAR were recruited to sites of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) replication. eIF2 becomes phosphorylated, and SGs containing G3BP1, eIF3 and eIF4B are induced in TBEV-infected cells. there is also evidence that infection with bovine viral diarrhea virus impairs the arsenite-mediated SG assembly. SG assembly is regulated by dsRNA promoting phosphorylation of eIF2 mediated by PKR. dsRNA promoting phosphorylation of eIF2 is regulated by a rapid eIF2 dephosphorylation through both protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and its regulatory subunit, growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible 34 (GADD34) both mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) and TGEV induce TIA-1/TIAR aggregates with a concomitant increase in eIF2 phosphorylation levels. MHV promotes SG assembly at early times post-infection. TGEV induces SG assembly at later times post-infection. NS1-mutatant virus unable to bind dsRNA or by expressing an NS1-deficient IAV. NS1-mediated inhibition of SG assembly depends on interaction with RNA-associated protein 55 (RAP55) besides NS1, nucleoprotein (NP) and polymerase acidic protein X (PA-X) also contribute to block the SG assembly independent of eIF2 phosphorylation. a virus in the family Rhabdoviridae induces the phosphorylation of eIF2. it promotes the assembly of SG-like particles that contain TIA-1, TIAR, PCBP2, viral replication proteins and RNA. the SG-like structures may play a role in the VSV infection cycle. recombinant 4C(-) infection forms SG-like structures containing RIG-I and unusual viral RNA species. they require a capped oligonucleotide, which is scavenged from host mRNAs, to initiate its own mRNA synthesis. these mechanisms take place in PBs, where the viral N protein binds to cap structures of cellular mRNAs, and the endonuclease domain of the RNA a report with the Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) showed attenuation of the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, which in turn increases the activity of 4EBP1/2 proteins leading to the arrest of cap-dependent translation. the authors observed that 5\u2032-end sequences from TOP mRNAs are included in RVFV\u2019s mRNAs captured by the cap-snatching mechanism in PBs. bunyaviruses use complex mechanisms of transcription/translation that are potentially interconnected with cytoplasmic RNA granules. these findings show that bunyaviral proteins, like other viral proteins, have evolved mechanisms to inactivate PKR and inhibit the IFN response. however, the translation shut-off is not observed in Hantavirus-infected cells. ssRNA retroviruses are enveloped, positive ssRNA viruses. viral protein VP35 disrupts SG formation independently of eIF2. tax interacts with USP10, inhibiting SG assembly. HIV-1 Gag mediates the disassembly of preexisting SGs via an interaction with G3BP1 [229]. gRNA promotes the assembly of a pre-translation initiation intermediate with DDX3, another SG component, and a subset of translation initiation factors, such as eIF4GI and PABPC1. geneme Virus Family Virus PB Blockade Mechanism Reference I dsDNA Adenoviridae Adenovirus No Yes Decreased PB by redistribution of E4 11K [237] papillomaviridae Human papilloma virus (HPV) Yes No Increased of Dcp1a, EDC4, Rck/p54/DDX6 and Rap55 protein levels [238] III dsRNA Reoviridae dsDNA Viruses Adenovirus regulates its gene expression over the time of infection. dsDNA Viruses Adenovirus regulates its gene expression over the time of infection. early protein E4 11k binds Rck/p54/DDX6, relocalizing it with PB components such as Lsm-1, Ge-1, Ago2 and Xrn1 to aggresomes, sites where these proteins are inactivated. in the human papilloma virus, the oncoprotein E6 commands the re-colocalization of PKR in PBs, suggesting an antiviral effect for these granules. flaviviruses generate subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA), as a product of gRNA degradation by Xrn1 at pseudoknot 3. inhibition of XRN1 by sfRNA-interaction results in accumulation of uncapped cellular mRNA [243] hantavirus nucleocapsid protein (N) avoids the 5\u2032 cap degradation of cellular mRNAs, protecting them from Dcp1a/Dcp2-mediated decapping.
