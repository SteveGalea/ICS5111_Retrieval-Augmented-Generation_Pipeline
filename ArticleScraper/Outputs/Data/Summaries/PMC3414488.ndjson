{"summary": "we retrospectively evaluated the use of recent, short, historical time-series for recognizing the onset of community outbreaks of respiratory tract infections (RTIs) the data used referred to the proportion of diagnoses for upper or lower RTIs to total diagnoses for house-call visits. the development of new methods for early recognition or prediction of community outbreaks or the improvement of the currently used methods is of increasing scientific and public health interest. the development of new methods for early recognition or prediction of community outbreaks or the improvement of the currently used methods is of increasing scientific and public health interest. the data we used referred to the 9-year period between January 01, 2000 and December 10, 2008. the data we used referred to the 9-year period between January 01, 2000 and December 10, 2008. they were recorded by a total of 38 SOS Doctors specialists. this network performs emergency, fee-per-service, house-call visits. a priori classification of the observations as normal (within the epidemic threshold) or aberrant (exceeding the epidemic threshold) a periodic regression model with cubic trend and annual periodicity was used to estimate baseline levels. the threshold for each week t is defined as the upper limit of the Student 100(1a)% confidence interval for the unknown mean (degrees of freedom = m1). for the parameter m, that represents the number of weeks analyzed prior to the week t, we assigned values between 4\u20136. for the parameter m, that represents the number of weeks analyzed prior to the week t, we assigned values between 4\u20136. for a CUSUM procedure, the in-control (average run length) ARL is a measure of the time interval between false alarms, therefore it is analogous to a Type I error. for a fixed k value, increasing the h value would generally result in lower sensitivity and higher specificity results (and vice-versa). the alert generating methods of simple regression and CUSUMs were applied on our retrospective time-series data set. we compared this output to the classification of the same observation as normal or aberration according to the reference standard method. the primary diagnosis for each house-call visit was registered by the physician who examined the patient in a specifically designed report form. the type of observations chosen for our analysis is the weekly-averaged proportion of house-call visits for upper (or lower) RTIs to total house-call visits during week t. to estimate baseline levels for our data set we removed the highest 20% percentile of the observations, which we considered to represent aberrant values. we used an upper 97.5% one-sided confidence interval around the calculated baseline levels to define the epidemic thresholds. k stands for the standardized reference value K of the CUSUM. it is usually defined as the intermediate value between the in-control process mean and the out-of-control process target mean. the in-control process is represented by the normal observations (non-epidemic), while the out-of-control process is represented by the epidemic observations. h was calculated with respect to a specific ARL approximately representing the desired Type I error rate = 0.10. the h value, given k and ARL, was computed as 1.53. threshold for each week t is defined as the upper limit of the Student 100(1a)% confidence interval for the unknown mean (degrees of freedom = m1) the parameter h represents the threshold of the method. for a fixed k value, increasing the h value would generally result in lower sensitivity and higher specificity results (and vice-versa) the same applies for k, for a fixed h value [15] the onset of an outbreak corresponds to the first aberrant value according to the reference standard classification. we applied the simple regression and CUSUM models for detection of an outbreak at week t, only if the observations for the prior m-week interval were all classified as non-aberrant by the reference standard classification. the best fit model for upper and lower RTIs solely included a constant trend component. in Figures 1a and 1b, we provide sequence plots for both groups of observations (upper and lower RTIs, respectively) superimposing the reference standard classification, accompanied by the results of the statistical model fitting. m = 6 0.53 (0.47\u20130.59) 0.99 (0.97\u20131.00) 266/461 (57.7%) (k,h) = (0.75, 1.53) m = 4 0.85 (0.61\u2013 0.96) 0.91 (0.87\u20130.94) 305/463 (65.9%) m = 5 0.94 (0.69\u20131.00)

evaluated are ordinarily collected in a real-time manner by the private company for own purposes. however, no additional costs are entailed for the collection of this type of data. upper and lower RTIs may be associated with community outbreaks than lower RTIs. the models we used for short-term recognition of community outbreaks performed better for upper RTIs. instead of daily values, we selected to analyze weekly-averaged values for RTIs. we analyzed a large data-set of historical data as the reference standard. future studies aiming to prospectively evaluate data from house call visits could use data from official sentinel surveillance networks, if available, as the reference standard. performance of the above models in prospective detection of onset of RTI outbreaks on the basis of data for house call visits."}
