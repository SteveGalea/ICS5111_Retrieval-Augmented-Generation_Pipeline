{"summary": "pathogen spillover is the process by which a pathogen is transmitted from a reservoir host species to a recipient host species [1,2] this theme issue focuses on pathogen spillover sensu stricto, except where explicitly noted. many of the examples considered pertain to zoonotic spillover (i.e. from wildlife or domestic animals to humans) studying each factor fails to account for the hierarchical and often nonlinear dynamics of the spillover system. this theme issue stemmed from a 2018 workshop on cross-species transmission of pathogens. participants from interlinked fields discussed how to better understand and predict pathogen spillover. mechanistic approaches may be especially useful in systems where spillovers are infrequent, rarely observed or hard to differentiate from within-species transmission. authors use case studies of brucellosis in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem [13] and of avian influenza virus in China and North America [14] to emphasize potential solutions to these challenges for estimating spillover risk. the authors highlight that any such statistical efforts will compile a dataset of explanatory variables expected to relate to pre-spillover processes. they show how modelling cross-species transmission as a percolation process reveals first principles for how such datasets will behave. percolation theory reveals an inherent nonlinearity in modelling spillover counts. henipavirus infection dynamics in bats are poorly understood. henipavirus infection dynamics in bats are poorly understood. henipavirus infection dynamics in bats are poorly understood. pepin et al. [28] review and discuss how genomics, experimental ecology and epidemiological modelling can be leveraged to understand viral reassortment. environmental metagenomics and field-based viral diagnostics (e.g. field-based nucleic acid extraction, PCR and sequencing) hold promise for characterizing this context of viral reassortment. the authors integrate recent developments in the dose\u2013response literature and re-analysing data from animal challenge experiments with Nipah virus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus [35,36] to highlight challenges and opportunities arising at the intersection of infectious disease ecology, microbial risk assessment and virology. authors propose non-mutually exclusive hypotheses to explain why novel bacterial pathogens may be less likely to specialize on their novel hosts. they present three well-documented examples of viruses that have crossed these barriers to cause epidemics or pandemics in the new host species. virulence induced by reservoirs at high phylogenetic distance may limit viral capacity for onward transmission in recipient human hosts. virulence induced by reservoirs at high phylogenetic distance positively correlates with human mortality but negatively correlates with human-to-human transmissibility. the programme has educated community members in wildlife carcass reporting and behavioral risk reduction as well as built capacity for safe carcass sampling by trained local responders. zoonotic diseases such as Rift Valley fever present with severe clinical signs in domestic animal populations, but lack of active surveillance can miss these sentinels. the authors develop a spatially explicit, stochastic model of pathogen transmission within and between wildlife reservoirs and livestock recipient hosts. biosecurity, containment and retroactive vaccination of the reservoir are the most effective for limiting the spatial spread and magnitude of spillover risk for fast-moving epidemics. future directions and conclusion Pathogen spillover is the result of a complex series of events that result in the successful establishment of infection in a recipient host. authors contextualize a diverse range of approaches to pathogen spillover within these scales to illustrate critical areas of pragmatic overlap. authors' contributions All authors contributed to the development of ideas and to the writing of this manuscript.
