{"summary": "three markers aberrantly expressed in breast cancer are used for targeted therapy in clinics. the hormone receptors for estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PgR) and the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2) represent approximately 15% of all breast cancer cases. there are approximately 538 kinases in the human genome. only a few of the kinases have been well studied in various types of cancer. kinases represent potential chemoresistance genes in TNBC cells. g/ml streptomycin, 100 IU penicillin, and 1% L-glutamine at 37\u00b0C. cells were transfected with 5 nM scramble siRNA or siRNA against Src kinase (6714, Dharmacon) for 72 h using lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen, 13778-150) luminescent signal (RLU) between 48 and 72 h was monitored to reflect cell viability (as measured by the ATP level) cells without a luciferase reporter plasmid were treated with dasatinib (S1021, Selleckchem) for 24 h and mixed with Cell-Titer Glo (G7572, Promega) for 10 min. cells were cultured for 3 days until tumorsphere formation. the mRNA level of each gene was amplified with specific primers and SYBR Green Master Mix. the results were analyzed by a StepOnePlusTM system (Applied Biosystems) using GAPDH as normalization control. the data are reported as the mean SEM from at least three independent experiments. to compare cell viability between control and Src-silenced cells, non-parametric 2-tailed Student t-test is used to evaluate significance. RNA against Src (TRCN0000195339) using 6 l lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, 11668027) for 16 h. transfected cells were rinsed with media and incubated for 48 h. cells harboring a luciferase plasmid were seeded into each well of 384-well white plates. the cells were cultured for 3 days until tumorsphere formation. the cells were then treated with anticancer drugs for 48 h. the cells were then stained with Calcein AM (Green) and Ethidium homodimer-1 (EthD-1, Red) membranes were blocked with bovine serum albumin (BSA) for anti-phosphoserine antibody. membranes were then incubated with antibodies including anti-Src (2109, cell signaling), anti-pSrc (6943, cell signaling), phospho-Stat-3 (9145, cell signaling) and anti-ACTB (A5441, Sigma) at 4\u00b0C overnight. MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with chemotherapeutic drugs camptothecin and doxorubicin in the presence or absence of staurosporine. STS reduced the cell viability and synergized the cytotoxic effects of the chemotherapeutic drugs, particularly of doxorubicin. genes were further confirmed with parental TNBC cells (MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T) but only silencing Src kinase augmented doxorubicin-induced cytotoxicity in both MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T cells. we also examined the kinome hits in non-TNBC breast cancer cells. cells were seeded into 384-well plates containing pooled siRNA (10 nM) against each single kinase gene for 48 h and treated with (red dots) or without (green dots) doxorubicin (1 M) for 24 h. the top 15 hits that were resistant to doxorubicin in MDA-MB-231 cells are shown. live and dead cell populations were counted separately and calculated as percentage using untreated and methanol-treated cells as all (100%) live and dead cells. chemosensitivity in tumorspheres with scramble siRNA (siCtrl) was shown as p 0.05, p 0.01. stably Src-silenced TNBC cells were more sensitive to doxorubicin treatments than control cells. further, MDA-MB-468, another highly expressed and activated TNBC cell line, was even more resistant to doxorubicin. a single stable clone for each cell line was selected with puromycin. the knockdown efficiency of Src was examined with immunoblotting and real-time PCR. MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T cells were transfected with siRNA against Src and treated with doxorubicin. phosphorylation of Src kinase decreased the protein level of total and phosphorylated Src in MDA-MB-231 cells. the cells were harvested to examine the activation or induction of downstream effectors of Src, including p-AKT, p-STAT3 and Bik, with immunoblotting. the cells were harvested to examine the phosphorylation of Src, AKT, and STAT3 with immunoblotting. gene expression in the tumor tissues of patients with TNBC was significantly higher than that in tumor adjacent normal tissues (Figure 6A; p 0.001, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). a high co-expression level of Src and STAT3 was associated with poor overall survival in both early (Figure 7; I + II, p = 0.002) and advanced (III + IV, p = 0.029) pathological stages. Src gene expression was analyzed from TCGA TNBC dataset. it was presented as reads per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads. p 0.001 vs. adjacent nomal tissue in patients with TNBC. p values were estimated by multivariate Cox\u2019s regression analysis. p values were estimated by multivariate Cox\u2019s regression analysis. p values were estimated by multivariate Cox\u2019s regression analysis. orubicin-treated MDA-MB-231 cells were used to monitor cell viability in live cells. we selected 15 top-ranked genes due to knockdown of these genes enhanced cytotoxicity of doxorubicin in MDA-MB-231 cells. knockdown of these genes enhanced cytotoxicity of doxorubicin in MDA-MB-231 cells. the triple-negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 harboring a luciferase expression vector was treated with chemotherapeutic drugs including camptothecin and doxorubicin. the luciferase was measured with cell permeable D-luciferin to monitor cell viability in live cells. the top 15 hits that were resistant to doxorubicin in MDA-MB-231 cells are shown. the significant effects of siRNA against top 15 genes in cells were shown as p 0.05, p 0.01 or p 0.001. the tumorspheres were further treated with doxorubicin (1 M) or camptothecin (CPT, 10 M) and death effects were determined by Live/Dead cytotoxicity assay. ubicin in both MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T cells in a dose-dependent manner. clonogenic assay results showed that the number of colonies was decreased in doxorubicin-treated, Src-silenced cells. stably Src-silenced TNBC cells were more sensitive to doxorubicin treatments than control cells. 78T cells were exposed to doxorubicin for 1 h and allowed to recover for 14 days. the cells were fixed and stained with crystal violet to count colonies formed. the quantitative results are expressed as the mean SEM from three independent experiments. c-STAT3 Axis in Chemoresistance in TNBC Cells Src was the first discovered oncogenic tyrosine kinase due to its ability to promote tumor initiation and malignancy. the kinase can lead to drug resistance in cancer cells during targeted therapy through the activation of several downstream effectors. b further inhibited cell viability and enhanced doxorubicin sensitivity in MDA-MB-231 cells. expression of STAT3 constitutive active form (CA) was more resistant to doxorubicin than dominant negative form (DN) in MDA-MB-231 cells. MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with vector encoding STAT3 constitutive active (CA) or dominant negative mutant (DN) for cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin with Cell-Titer Glo. the results are expressed as the mean SEM from three independent experiments. a high co-expression level of Src and STAT3 was associated with poor overall survival in both early (I + II) and advanced (III + IV, p = 0.029) pathological stages. a trend for the association of high co-expression of Src and STAT3 with poor disease-free survival was not statistically significant. 92 (1.24\u201312.36) 0.020 3.87 (1.08\u201313.80) 0.039 Disease-free survival SRC (L) STAT3 (L) 13 (15.7) 1.00 1.00 Either 56 (67.5) 0.90 (0.22\u20133.65) 0.884 1.38 (0.17\u201311.52) 0.768 SRC (H) STAT3 (H) 14 (16.9) 1.60 (0.33\u20137.89) 0.561 2.09 (0.19\u201323. kinase is the most resistant kinase in TNBC cells in response to chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin. ablation of Src reduced phosphorylation AKT and STAT3 in TNBC cells. high co-expression of Src and STAT3 was further associated with poor prognosis. rine/threonine-protein kinase NIM1, C-terminal Src kinase (CSK) and ROS proto-oncogene 1 (ROS1) these kinases may be overexpressed or activated in MDA-MB-231 cells but not in Hs578T cells. this may be involved in doxorubicin resistance in MDA-MB-231 cells. tyrosine kinases are overexpressed in TNBC and promote receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylation. the Src protein level is higher in tumor tissues of patients with TNBC than in non-TNBC patients. phosphorylation of Src at Tyr416, which activates Src, is associated with poor disease-free survival. dehydrogenase isoform 1 (ALDH1), a cancer stemness marker, and sphere formation in lung cancer cells. Src may also inhibit apoptosis via direct phosphorylation at tyrosin 530 of Ku-70. this protein is a crucial protein to repair DNA double-strand breaks. Src-STAT3 in chemoresistance of TNBC may play an important role in the chemoresistance of TNBC cells. the axis may play an important role in the chemoresistance of TNBC cells. YK (Figure 4E), C-WH and C-HW (Figures 5C,D) performed the remaining experiments. TCGA data was analyzed by C-HL, H-TC and MH."}
