{"summary": "two major programs were started in San Jose, and surrounding areas. the goal was to reduce the intact cat populations. the first program was the free Spay/Neuter Voucher Program. the county is located at the southern end of the San Francisco Bay Area. the shelter has animal control service contracts with Cupertino, Los Gatos, Milpitas and Saratoga. the five cities or towns service area contains 63% of the county population. the humane society Silicon Valley (HSSV) and San Jose Animal Care and Services (SJACS) are the two largest. the small shelter in San Martin serves the rural unincorporated portions of the county. the shelters are close to ending the euthanasia of all treatable-rehabilitatable impounded animals in the county. only 6% of cats euthanized for the entire county were treatable-rehabilitatable. the shelters can be defined as either \u201csource\u201d or \u201creceiving\u201d shelters. in 2013, only 2% of cats were reclaimed by owners in San Jose (170 out of 8,643). it seems apparent that the only substantial cat population left to alter would be the feral population. the euthanasia rate does not include those cats who died of natural causes while in the shelter. the program requires incoming feral/free roaming cats be held 72 h. within 24 h of entering the shelter system the cats are evaluated for inclusion in the program. euthanasia, euthanasia, and adoption are possible outcomes for a cat. cats are not returned to their trapped location in high impact situations. door hangers are placed in proximity to the returned cat, advising the neighbors of the program. in 1990 nearly 28,000 cats entered the HSSV and SCCo shelters. cat intakes were 18.7 per 1,000 humans in 1990 for the county. by the end of fiscal year 2014, intakes were 7.0 per 1,000 humans. the difference in cat intakes between three of the shelters from 2009 to 2013 do not show the same magnitude of decrease as SJACS. the difference in cat intakes among three of the shelters from 2009 to 2013 do not show the same magnitude of decrease as SJACS. the annual stray cat population in the shelter has decreased by more than 3,000 cats per year. a total of 10,080 individual feral cats and kittens were impounded at the shelter, processed through the SNR program. the shelter received again 185 (1.8%) dead on arrival. as of June 2014, only 13 feral cats were euthanized healthy in the prior 12 months. when a cat was euthanized as a healthy feral, it was because the location to return the cat was not deemed safe or viable. as a general rule, the shelter does not support the relocation of feral cats to new areas. total shelter cat intakes from 2006\u20132014, including cats entering from contract cities, in comparison to the human population. in 2009, when cat intakes were climbing, total impoundment for cats and kittens was 10.2 per 1,000 humans. by 2014, after four years of SNR, total cat impoundment had decreased to 7.0 per 1,000 humans. in 2006 there were 5.4 dogs and 9.9 cats impounded per 1,000 humans. euthanasia rate was expected to drop, at a minimum by the number of feral cats returned, rather than euthanized. SVACA (Silicon Valley Animal Control Authority, 2014) data showed a 21% decrease in cat impounds. the data do not include cats dead on arrival, cats with owner euthanasia requests, or cats that naturally died in the shelter. table 1 shows the exact intake for each shelter. SVACA opened in 2004, and PAAS had no publicly available information prior to 2007. a total of 10,080 individual feral cats and kittens were impounded at the shelter, processed through the SNR program, and returned back to their capture site from March 2010 until June 2014. the difference in cat intakes among three of the shelters from 2009 to 2013 do not show the same magnitude of decrease as SJACS, and in case of HSSV, increased by 438 cats. from march 2010 to June 2014, 385 cats (3.4%) were euthanized as a healthy feral, but unadoptable, out of the total 11,423 healthy feral cats impounded alive at the shelter. the cause of death was not specified in the records. from 1,629 in CY 2009 to 1,308 in FY 2014, or a 99% decrease. the number of cats euthanized for Upper Respiratory Infection (URI) in the shelter declined from 736 in CY 2009, to seven in FY 2014. the dog impound increase was primarily driven by Chihuahuas and mixes of that breed. in 2014, there were 6.1 dogs impounded per 1,000 humans, down from 7.0 in 2012. in 2006 there were 9.9 cats impounded per 1,000 humans. annual cat intake, euthanasia and SNR cats, 2006\u20132014, at SJACS compared with euthanasia and the number of feral cats returned. the combined cat/kitten save rate increased from 29.1% in 2009, to 76.7% in 2014. cats encompassed 9.5% of feral cats altered through the program. microchip and ear tip removal did successfully alert shelter staff. URI is one of the most prevalent cat health concerns facing shelter personnel. data from the 2008 Jacksonville, Florida, USA shelter neuter return project showed a 23% decrease in cat intakes after 3 years from their SNR program. the SVACA 21% decrease in cat impounds after three years of SNR were similar to SJACS, giving corroboration to the data received. no scientific analysis has been made, as this report is intended to be descriptive of changes in cat intake and euthanasia at the shelter since the inception of the SNR program. there were substantial costs involved to perform the surgeries, and inject vaccinations and microchips on a massive scale. paper."}
