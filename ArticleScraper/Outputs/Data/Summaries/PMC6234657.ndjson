{"summary": "Respiratory infections in the cystic fibrosis lung remain the primary cause of mortality and morbidity in CF. the defective function of the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator gene initiates a lifelong cycle of neutrophilic inflammation, progressive bronchiectasis, mucus obstruction and recurrent microbial infection of the CF airway. the CF airway environment is vulnerable to colonization by particular bacterial and fungi RV is the most common respiratory virus detected in CF airway. despite numerous studies into the virology of CF airways, the mechanistic link between virus infection, airway inflammation and structural lung disease remains unknown. there are more than 150 serotypes of RV, which have been classified into 3 species; RV-A, RV-B, and RV-C. the cell receptor for RV-C species has been identified as cadherin related family member 3. RV load has been observed to be significantly higher in children with CF (>100 times) when compared to healthy controls. an age preference for RV-associated CF exacerbations has also been reported for young children 5 years old. RV infection in adults is accompanied by an increased risk of PEx, prolonged antibiotic prescription, higher respiratory symptom scores and heightened level of C-reactive protein. it is critical to elucidate how this virus alters host antiviral and inflammatory responses.

RVs can disrupt epithelial tight junctions including zona occludens 1 (ZO-1) protein by stimulating the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during viral replication. signaling pathways induced by retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors (NLRs) the airway epithelium also responds to RV infection by activating pro-inflammatory signaling pathways. IL-8 exerts important antiviral and cytotoxic effects and is involved in the activation, differentiation, survival and recruitment of NK cells and CD most studies performed to date assessed cells from adult CF cohorts who had significant disease and structural lung damage. studying cells from pediatric CF cohorts may generate more relevant data and potentially reveal new insights into early life RV infections that could be exploited therapeutically. tokines Inflammatory Cytokines Apoptosis References Adult CF (16\u201333 years) BEC (ALI) RV39 3 106 TCID50 104 TCID50/mL Similar to normal cells Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) RV: IFN, 1, 2 mRNA and protein Only in CF cells RV: IL8 mRNA RV + PA: IL-8 mRNA Similar to normal cells Not measured Chattoraj IFNs (IFN-1, IFN-2/3 and IFN-), PRRs (RIG-1 and MDA-5) and ISGs (PKR, OAS1, viperin and MxA) compared to normal cells CXCL8/IL-8, IL-6 and CXCL10/IP-10. no studies have focused on potential treatments for RV infection in CF individuals. the development of a long-lasting RV vaccine has not been successful. no suitable animal models for CF exhibit complete spectrum of CF phenotype besides CF pig and ferret. early studies involving prophylactic administration of IFN-2 or IFN- showed a reduction in RV-induced episodes but no difference in symptom severity or duration. multiple side effects from high dose administration of IFNs, including nasal bleeding, transient leukopenia and sore throat have also been reported. Ivacaftor has been found to reduce sputum P. aeruginosa density (>60-fold) and airway inflammation significantly. multi-target drug design also holds potential and could be employed to exert both antiviral and anti-inflammation effects. these techniques allow analysis for \u201call molecules\u201d regulated at the gene level. enhancing or diminishing specific molecules can be a more promising therapeutic approach. computational approaches are used to organize or manage these data sets and interpret the biological inference. key hub genes and central genes with high connectivity exert large effects on signal transduction. Molecular network analysis also allows enrichment of functional modules to identify which area group of genes are cooperatively working together to perform specific biological function. omics data has discovered disease modules and revealed substantial inter-patient heterogeneity, highlighting the potential importance of customize treatments to conditions. ivermectin, trifluridine, astemizole, amlodipine, maprotiline, apomorphine, mometasone, and nortriptyline show significant anti-proliferative activity against glioblastoma. the strategy to repurpose already approved drugs could advance antiviral therapies by reducing cost and improving and quality of life for affected individuals. emergence of single cell transcriptomics could be used to compliment 3D airway models and accelerate progress in this new era of scientific research. authors declare that research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
