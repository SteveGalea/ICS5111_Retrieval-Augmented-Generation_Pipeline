{"summary": "studies on SPB have been hampered by the limited availability of markers for SPB in predelivery clinical samples that can be easily compared with gestational age-matched controls. we hypothesize that SPB involves aberrant placental RNA expression, and that such RNA transcripts can be detected in predelivery maternal plasma samples. in developed countries, reported rates of preterm birth or delivery before 37 completed weeks of gestation are generally 5\u20139% [1] of all preterm births, around 65% are spontaneous preterm births (SPB; resulting from spontaneous preterm labor and preterm pre-labor rupture of membranes) genetic studies have reported associations of certain polymorphisms in individual genes involved in infection and inflammation with preterm birth [3]\u2013[13]. we have profiled the RNA levels of essentially all human genes in the SPB and STB placentas, using a gene expression platform. previously, we and others have observed that the placenta releases its nucleic acids in maternal plasma [21], [22]. this may result in novel markers for SPB in maternal plasma. pregnant women who were attending the department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong were recruited for this study. a maternal blood sample was obtained immediately upon recruitment, while the placenta was obtained immediately upon delivery. a maternal blood sample was obtained immediately upon recruitment, while the placenta was obtained immediately upon delivery. 0.001b Rupture of membrane >24 h before delivery (n, %) 4 (40%) 2 (20%) 0 (0%) 0.082 Antepartum hemorrhage (n, %) 2 (10%) 1 (10%) 0 (0%) 0.329 a Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous variables. a maternal peripheral blood sample (12 mL) was collected during preterm labor. plasma was harvested from EDTA-blood by a reported double-centrifugation protocol [26] to improve the yield of RNA, the processed plasma (1.6 mL) was then mixed with Trizol LS reagent (4.8 mL) coding for interleukin 1 receptor-like 1 (IL1RL1), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2), glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPX3), nidogen 1 (NID1), actin, gamma 2, smooth muscle, enteric (ACTG2), transgelin (TAGLN) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogen concentrations of mRNA targets in a sample were analyzed relative to the GAPDH mRNA in the sample unless otherwise stated. Statistical analyses were performed using non-parametric tests. gestational age was established based on menstrual date confirmed by sonographic examination prior to 20 weeks gestation. for each participant, a maternal blood sample was obtained immediately upon recruitment, while the placenta was obtained immediately upon delivery. indicated preterm births, threatened preterm labor (term birth), multiple pregnancies, pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, fetal chromosomal and structural abnormalities were excluded from this study SPB Term birth P-valuea Number of participants (n, %) 10 27 - Maternal age in years (median, IQR) 32 (28\u201333) 32 (27\u201334) 0.707 Nulliparous (n, %) 6 (60%) 16 (59%) 1.000 Weeks at blood-taking. plasma was harvested from EDTA-blood by a reported double-centrifugation protocol [26] to improve the yield of RNA, the processed plasma (1.6 mL) was then mixed with Trizol LS reagent (Invitrogen) (4.8 mL) the RT-qPCR assay for all mRNA targets, except for ACTG2, were designed to be intron-spanning. the RT-qPCR assay for ACTG2 mRNA did not span any intron. details of each mRNA target, the sequence and exon locations of each primer and probe, reaction conditions and thermal profiles are available in File S1, Tables S1 and S2. microarray analysis was performed on five placental tissue samples collected from SPB (Group I, SPB placentas, delivered at 24.4 weeks\u201333.0 weeks) each sample was interrogated by 54675 probesets representing the transcripts of essentially all human genes. over 47000 transcripts and their variants, including those transcribed from more than 38500 well characterized genes and UniGenes, were interrogated by these microarray probes. 426 probe signals were changed (240 were increased and 186 were decreased) by >2.9-fold in the preterm (SPB) placentas, compared with the term (STB) placentas.

SPB, spontaneous preterm birth, STB, spontaneous term birth. we sought for transcripts that were both highly expressed in the SPB placentas and aberrantly expressed in the SPB placentas. the 7 transcripts, except the NID1 mRNA, were identified as the SPB-associated placental RNA that could potentially be detected in maternal plasma. the RT-qPCR data showed that the medians of normalized concentrations of IL1RL1, VEGFA, IGF2, ACTG2, GPX3, NID1 and TAGLN were 8.96-fold (p = 0.014), 3.27-fold (p = 0.006), 1.55-fold (p = nta relative to the STB placentas ranged from 2.32 to 8.96, which were comparable to those according to the microarray data. further characterization of aberrantly expressed RNA in the SPB placentas Genes that were up- or down-regulated in the SPB placenta may be associated specifically to the pathogenesis of SPB. the normalized concentrations of all seven mRNA transcripts, except IGF2 mRNA, were higher in the SPB placentas than the STB placentas. only the normalized concentrations of the IL1RL1, VEGFA, NID1 and TAGLN mRNA transcripts were higher in STB placentas. IL1RL1 mRNA showed the greatest fold-change in the SPB placentas compared with the STB placentas. we quantified the concentrations of IL1RL1 mRNA, which showed the greatest fold-change in the SPB placentas. IL1RL1 mRNA was detected in only one of these 27 (3.7%) plasma samples of gestation in women with no labor eventually resulted in term birth. the detection rate of IL1RL1 mRNA in predelivery maternal plasma samples was over 16 times higher in women with preterm labor and eventually resulted in SPB. 1.0 weeks (median; IQR, 27.8\u201332.3 weeks) of gestation (Table 2). SPB involves aberrant gene expression in the placenta. each sample was interrogated by 54675 probesets, representing the transcripts of essentially all human genes. the microarray data showed that 426 probe signals were changed by >2.9-fold in the preterm (SPB) placentas, compared with the term (STB) placentas. the list of up-regulated genes (Tables 3 and S5) and down-regulated genes (Tables 4 and S6) in the SPB placentas are tabulated in the order of the fold-change values. the RNA transcript interrogated by each probeset is shown as the gene symbol and name approved by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee at the European Bioinformatics Institute. only 15 transcripts with the greatest fold-change values are shown in Table S5.

IL1RL1 mRNA showed the greatest fold-change in the SPB placentas compared with the STB placentas. mRNA was detected only if the RT-qPCR signal was higher than the LOD, which was determined as the lowest concentration at which 95% of the positive samples are detected. IL1RL1 mRNA was detected in only one of these 27 (3.7%) plasma samples of gestation in women with no labor eventually resulted in term birth. the detection rate of IL1RL1 mRNA in predelivery maternal plasma samples was 16 times higher in women with preterm labor and eventually resulted in SPB. b Blood sample collected from women at 30.9 weeks (median; IQR, 27.0\u201332.1 weeks) of gestation, during the presentation of preterm labor (Table 2). SPB, spontaneous preterm birth. compared with STB placentas. a recent microarray study compared gene expression data between SPB and indicated preterm births by cesarean section at 32\u201334 weeks of gestation. the differential gene expression patterns identified in our dataset are neither confounded by the underlying obstetric complications in indicated preterm births. -qPCR platform in the larger cohort (Figure 2G; SPB vs. STB, p0.05) represents genes that are differentially expressed in the clinical samples. we further investigated into the mechanistic aspects of SPB in humans. 6 of the 7 (86%) RNA transcripts identified by the above approach are predominantly associated with the pathological physiology of SPB. we performed the GO analysis the list of genes in Tables 3 and S5. not surprisingly, we observed an over-representation of gene functions involving acute inflammatory response (Table S7). mRNA has also been shown to be elevated during term and preterm parturition in the myometrium of sheep [40] and the uterus of mice [41] also over-represented among the genes up-regulated in the SPB placenta. a linkage, haplotype sharing, and association analysis has provided the evidence for IGF1R as a SPB predisposition gene. a panel of 36 RNA transcripts are aberrantly expressed in the SPB placentas. the IL1RL1 mRNA was detected in 60% of predelivery maternal plasma samples collected during preterm labor. the IL1RL1 mRNA was detected in only 3.7% of maternal plasma samples collected during preterm labor. the work presented here has provided the essential groundwork for further attempts to study SPB. previously, the difference between the genome-wide expression profiles of the SPB and STB placentas had not been compared. however, systematic identification of markers for SPB in maternal plasma could be detected before SPB eventually occurred.
