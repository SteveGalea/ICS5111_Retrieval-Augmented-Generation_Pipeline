{"summary": "ELL-associated factor 2 gene, EAF2, and its EAF1 homologue were originally identified as binding partners of ELL (11\u201319 lysine-rich leukemia), a fusion protein associated with myeloid leukemia (1, 2). Moreover, EAF2 could bind to pVHL, a classic tumor suppressor, and enhances pVHL protein stability (5). we found that EAF2 attenuates TGF- signaling and specifically interacts with Smad3 in vitro and in vivo but not with other Smad proteins. we found that EAF2 impairs Smad3 nuclear translocation, disrupts Smad3-Smad4 complex formation, and prevents binding of p300 to Smad3.

HEK293T and HepG2 cell lines were cultured in DMEM (Hyclone) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) all cells were grown at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. human Smad3 gene was subcloned into PM vector (Clontech) antibodies and Chemical Reagents Anti-EAF2 antibody was raised by injecting GST-EAF2 into rabbits or purchased from Epitomics (7118-1). anti-Myc (9E10), anti-GAPDH (sc-47724), anti-p21 (C-19), anti-His (H-15), anti-p300 (F-4), and anti-Smad4 (B-8) antibodies the data are reported as the mean S.E. of three independent experiments performed in triplicate. for endogenous co-immunoprecipitation, the experimental procedures have been described previously (7). the primers were synthesized using the first-strand cDNA synthesis kit. the primers were synthesized following the previous report (14) anti-EAF2 (Epitomics, 7118-1) and anti-Smad3 (Epitomics, EP568Y) were used for staining. the activity of the CAGA luciferase reporter was much lower in EAF2 wild type MEF cells (EAF2+/+) knockdown of EAF2 by shRNAs in haCaT cells increased activity of both CAGA luciferase and SBE4 luciferase reporters in response to stimulation with TGF- (2 ng/ml) efficiencies of both EAF2-shRNA-1- and EAF2-shRNA-2-mediated knockdown of EAF2 in haCaT cells were confirmed using Western blot analysis. efficiencies of EAF2-shRNA-1- and EAF2-shRNA-2-mediated knockdown of EAF2 were confirmed. the cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids. after 18\u201324 h, the cells were harvested for luciferase assays. knockdown of EAF2 using shRNAs (EAF2-shRNA-1 and EAF2-shRNA-2) in HaCaT cells caused an increase of p21 protein levels in the presence of TGF- (Fig. 2C2). mRNA levels of four TGF- target genes were higher in EAF2-null (EAF2/) MEF cells. hRNA-1 and EAF2-shRNA-2) in HaCaT cells enhanced protein levels of p21 in the presence of TGF- (2 ng/ml). c, control-shRNA (luciferase-shRNA); #1, EAF2-shRNA-1; #2, EAF2-shRNA-2. A, EAF2 associates with Smad3, but not with Smad3, and Smad4 in vivo. anti-Myc antibody conjugated agarose beads were used for immunoprecipitation. TGF- (2 ng/ml) was added to the medium. rabbit IgG was used as a control to examine whether EAF2 and Smad3 proteins interact endogenously. we performed coimmunoprecipitation assays using haCaT cell extracts by an anti-Smad3 antibody. together, these results suggest that EAF2 specifically interacts with Smad3 in the presence and absence of TGF-. fusion proteins were stained using Coomassie Blue. fusion proteins were detected by immunoblotting using anti-His antibody. fusion proteins were detected by immunoblotting using anti-His antibody. the activity of SBE4 luciferase reporter stimulated by Smad3 in EAF2-null (EAF2/) MEF cells was inhibited by overexpression of the full-length (p 0.0001) and the region of exon V-VI of EAF2 (p = 0.0006) but not by overexpression of the region of exon I-IV of EAF2. overexpression of full-length and domain of exons V-VI of human EAF2 inhibited Smad3 transcriptional activity. however, overexpression of only exons I-IV of EAF2 did not result in inhibition. together, these results suggest that inhibition of TGF- signaling by EAF2 might result from suppression of Smad3 transcriptional activity by EAF2 through a direct Smad3-EAF2 interaction. heximide (CHX) (50 g/ml) knockdown of EAF2 did not affect Smad3 phosphorylation. the cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids. after 18\u201324 h, the cells were harvested for Western blot analysis. anti-EAF2 and anti-Smad3 antibodies were used for immunohistochemical staining. overexpression of EAF2 had no effect on endogenous Smad3 phosphorylation in the presence of TGF- but not in the absence of TGF-. knockdown of EAF2 also did not affect Smad3 phosphorylation. knockdown of EAF2 could indeed enhance Smad3 nuclear translocation. but knockdown of EAF2 had no obvious effect on Smad2 nuclear translocation. a homolog of EAF2 could also specifically interact with Smad3 and inhibits Smad3 activity. overexpression of EAF2 dramatically reduced Smad4 binding to Smad3 in the presence of TGF-. in contrast, knockdown of EAF2 by EAF2-shRNA-2 in HaCaT cells enhanced endogenous Smad3 binding to Smad4. transcriptional adaptor CBP/p300 is a coactivator for Smad3 in TGF-induced transcriptional activation (32\u201334) to monitor Smad3 transcriptional activity directly, we cloned Smad3 into the pm vector (Clontech, Mountain View, CA), which could express a fusion protein containing a GAL4 DNA binding domain. overexpression of EAF2 could indeed inhibit Smad3 transcriptional activity induced by TGF- (Fig. 8, B the cells were harvested for luciferase assays or coimmunoprecipitation assays. after 18\u201324 h the cells were stimulated with TGF- (2 ng/ml) for 2 h. in haCaT cells, overexpression of EAF2 attenuated cell cycle arrest. without TGF- treatment, the number of cells with EAF2 overexpression arrested in G1 phase was significantly lower than that of the control without EAF2 overexpression. significant difference was observed in migration between EAF2 wild type MEF cells and EAF2-null MEF cells (Fig. 9C) the number of EAF2-null cells that had migrated was significantly larger than that observed for EAF2 wild type MEF cells (Fig. 9C2). these data suggest that EAF2 inhibits both TGF--induced cell cycle arrest at early G1 phase and TGF-induced cell migration. the ARE-luciferase reporter is known to be activated by both TGF- and activin via Smad2, Smad4 and FoxH (18), implying that Smad2, Smad4 and FoxH might not be the mediators of EAF2 in TGF- signaling. knockdown of EAF2 by shRNAs in haCaT cells enhanced the activity of both CAGA luciferase and SBE4 luciferase reporters. the efficiencies of EAF2-shRNA-1- and EAF2-shRNA-2-mediated knockdown of EAF2 were confirmed. the cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids. after 18\u201324 h, the cells were harvested for luciferase assays. overexpression of EAF2 in haCaT cells also caused a decrease of PAI-1 and p21 protein levels in the presence of TGF- (Fig. 2C1). knockdown of EAF2 using shRNAs (EAF2-shRNA-1 and EAF2-shRNA-2) in HaCaT cells caused an increase of p21 protein levels in the presence of TGF- (Fig. 2C2). 2 in HaCaT cells reduced the protein levels of both PAI-1 and p21 in the presence of TGF- (2 ng/ml). c, control-shRNA (luciferase-shRNA); #1, EAF2-shRNA-1; #2, EAF2-shRNA-2. HA-tagged Smad1, Smad2, and Smad3 were quite equivalent. but only HA-tagged Smad3 co-immunoprecipitated with Myc-EAF2. EAF2 associates with Smad3, but not with Smad1, Smad2, and Smad4 in vivo. anti-Smad3 antibody was used for immunoprecipitation and rabbit IgG was used as a control. results suggest that EAF2 specifically interacts with Smad3 in the presence and absence of TGF- (2 ng/ml) the association of GST-Smad3 domains with His-EAF2 was detected by immunoblotting using anti-His antibody. the input of His-tagged EAF2 was detected by immunoblotting using anti-His antibody. the activity of CAGA luciferase reporter stimulated by Smad3 was enhanced by knockdown of EAF2 in haCaT cells. B1, the activity of SBE4 luciferase reporter stimulated by Smad3 was enhanced by knockdown of EAF2 in haCaT cells. overexpression of full-length and domain of exons V-VI of human EAF2 inhibited Smad3 transcriptional activity. however, overexpression of only exons I-IV of EAF2 did not result in inhibition. the protein expression was confirmed by Western blot. the protein level of Smad3 was not affected by overexpression of EAF2 in HEK293T cells in the presence of cycloheximide (CHX) the protein level of Smad3 was not affected by overexpression of EAF2 in HEK293T cells in the presence of cycloheximide (CHX) (50 g/ml) anti-EAF2 and anti-Smad3 antibodies were used for immunohistochemical staining. overexpression of EAF2 had no effect on endogenous Smad3 phosphorylation in the presence or absence of TGF-. knockdown of EAF2 had no obvious effect on Smad2 nuclear translocation. but knockdown of EAF2 could indeed enhance Smad3 nuclear translocation. a homolog of EAF2 could also specifically interact with Smad3 and inhibits Smad3 activity. oligomerization of Smad3 with Smad4 is required for Smad3 to exhibit its transcriptional activity (10, 29\u201331) co-transfection of plasmid expressing Smad4 could indeed enhance Smad3 transcriptional activity. overexpression of EAF2 dramatically reduced Smad4 binding to Smad3 in the presence of TGF-. the cells were harvested for luciferase assays or coimmunoprecipitation assays. before harvest, the cells were stimulated with TGF- (2 ng/ml) for 2h. the transcriptional adaptor CBP/p300 is a coactivator for Smad3 in TGF- induced transcriptional activation. the cells were stimulated with TGF- (2 ng/ml) for 2h before analysis. the cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids. after 18\u201324 h the cells were harvested for luciferase assays. in the presence of TGF- (2 ng/ml), the growth rate of EAF2 wild type MEF cells (EAF2/) was higher than that of EAF2-null MEF cells (EAF2/) after TGF- treatment, more EAF2-null MEF cells (EAF2/) were migrated as compared with EAF2 wild type MEF cells (EAF2+/+) data are presented as the mean S.E. of three independent experiments performed in triplicate. without TGF- treatment, no significant difference was observed in migration between EAF2 wild type MEF cells and EAF2-null MEF cells. overexpression of EAF2 had no effect on ARE luciferase reporter activity in HepG2 cells. the ARE-luciferase reporter is known to be activated by both TGF- and activin via Smad2, Smad4, and FoxH (18), implying that Smad2, Smad4, and FoxH might not be the mediators of EAF2 in TGF- signaling. efficiencies of both EAF2-shRNA-1- and EAF2-sh the efficiencies of EAF2-shRNA-1- and EAF2-shRNA-2-mediated knockdown of EAF2 were confirmed. the efficiencies of EAF2-shRNA-1- and EAF2-shRNA-2-mediated knockdown of EAF2 were confirmed. overexpression of EAF2 haCaT cells caused expression of PAI-1 and MMP9 to dramatically decrease in the presence of TGF- (2 ng/ml) knockdown of EAF2 using shRNAs (EAF2-shRNA-1 and EAF2-shRNA-2) in HaCaT cells caused an increase of p21 protein levels in the presence of TGF-. the protein level of TGF- target genes was inhibited by EAF2. C1, knockdown of EAF2 by EAF2-shRNAs (EAF2-shRNA-1 and EAF2-shRNA-2) in HaCaT cells reduced the protein levels of both PAI-1 and p21 in the presence of TGF- (2 ng/ml) the expression levels of HA-tagged Smad1, Smad2, and Smad3 were quite equivalent, but only HA-tagged Smad3 co-immunoprecipitated with Myc-EAF2. the expression levels of HA-tagged Smad3 were quite equivalent, but only HA-tagged Smad3 co-immunoprecipitated with EAF2. coimmunoprecipitation between endogenous EAF2 and endogenous Smad3 in haCaT cells. anti-Smad3 antibody was used for immunoprecipitation and rabbit IgG was used as a control. results suggest that EAF2 specifically interacts with Smad3 in the presence and absence of TGF-. cipitation between transfected and expressed Myc-EAF2 domains and HA-Smad3 was detected by immunoblotting using anti-His antibody. the association of GST-Smad3 domains with His-EAF2 was detected by immunoblotting using anti-His antibody. the activity of SBE4 luciferase reporter stimulated by Smad3 was enhanced by knockdown of EAF2 in haCaT cells. B1, the activity of CAGA luciferase reporter stimulated by Smad3 was enhanced by knockdown of EAF2 in haCaT cells. the domain containing exons I-IV (amino acids 1\u2013161) of EAF2 cannot bind to Smad3. but the domain containing exons V-VI (amino acids 162\u2013260) of EAF2 can bind to Smad3. we performed promoter assays in EAF2-null MEF cells (EAF2/) AF2 does not affect Smad3 protein stability and phosphorylation but inhibits nuclear translocation. protein level of Smad3 was not altered after co-transfection and subsequent expression of an increasing amount of EAF2. anti-eAF2 and anti-Smad3 antibodies were used for immunohistochemical staining. anti-eAF2 and anti-Smad3 antibodies were used for immunohistochemical staining. overexpression of EAF2 could prevent Smad3 nuclear translocation in the presence of TGF- but not in the absence of TGF-. however, overexpression of EAF2 had no obvious effect on Smad2 nuclear translocation. knockdown of EAF2 could indeed enhance Smad3 nuclear translocation. oligomerization of Smad3 with Smad4 is required for Smad3 to exhibit its transcriptional activity (10, 29\u201331) co-transfection of plasmid expressing Smad4 could indeed enhance Smad3 transcriptional activity. overexpression of EAF2 dramatically reduced binding to Smad3 in the presence of TGF-. knockdown of EAF2 by EAF2-shRNA-2 in haCaT cells enhanced endogenous Smad3 binding to Smad4 in the presence of TGF-. after 18\u201324 h, the cells were harvested for luciferase assays or coimmunoprecipitation assays. the transactivity of Smad3 stimulated by TGF- was inhibited by overexpression of EAF2 in HepG2 cells. the cells were stimulated with TGF- (2 ng/ml) for 2h before analysis. growth rate of EAF2 wild type MEF cells was higher than that of EAF2-null MEF cells (EAF2/) in the presence of TGF- (2 ng/ml) in the presence of TGF- (2 ng/ml), the number of cells with EAF2 overexpression arrested in G1 phase was significantly lower than that of the control without EAF2 overexpression. treatment (2 ng/ml), more EAF2-null MEF cells (EAF2/) were migrated. without TGF- treatment, no significant difference was observed in migration between EAF2 wild type MEF cells and EAF2-null MEF cells (EAF2+/+) overexpression of EAF2 significantly reduced the activity of CAGA luciferase reporter stimulated using TGF- (2 ng/ml) Similarly, overexpression of EAF2 in Mv1Lu cells also caused a decrease in SBE4 luciferase reporter activity after the addition of TGF- (2 ng/ml) activity in EAF2-null MEF cells (EAF2/) was higher than that in EAF2 wild type MEF cells (EAF2+/+) (p = 0.0251) overexpression of EAF2 in Mv1Lu cells reduced SBE4 luciferase reporter activity in the presence of TGF- (2 ng/ml) overexpression of EAF2 haCaT cells caused expression of PAI-1 and MMP9 to dramatically decrease in the presence of TGF- (2 ng/ml) overexpression of EAF2 in HaCaT cells also caused a decrease of PAI-1 and p21 protein levels in the presence of TGF- (Fig. 2C1). mRNA levels of two TGF- target genes, PAI-1 (B1) and B2, MMP9 (B2), decreased when EAF2 was overexpressed in the presence of TGF- (2 ng/ml) c1, knockdown of EAF2 by EAF2-shRNAs in HaCaT cells enhanced the protein levels of p21 in the presence of TGF- (2 ng/ml). the expression levels of HA-tagged Smad1, Smad2, and Smad3 were quite equivalent, but only HA-tagged Smad3 co-immunoprecipitated with Myc-EAF2. HA empty vector or HA-tagged Smad1, Smad2, or Smad3 vector were co-transfected with Myc-tagged EAF2 into HEK293T cells. HA-Smad2/Smad3 and Myc-EAF2 co-transfected with EAF2. HA-tagged Smad3, Smad7, and HA empty vector were co-transfected. TGF- (2 ng/ml) was added to the medium. the association of GST-Smad3 domains with His-EAF2 was detected by immunoblotting using anti-His antibody. in HEK293T cells, overexpression of EAF2 greatly suppressed Smad3 transcriptional activity. in haCaT cells, knockdown of EAF2 by shRNAs enhanced Smad3 transcriptional activity. activity of CAGA luciferase reporter stimulated by Smad3 alone or Smad3/TGF- combination was inhibited by overexpression of EAF2 in Mv1Lu cells. the activity of SBE4 luciferase reporter stimulated by Smad3 was enhanced by knockdown of EAF2 in HaCaT cells. the protein expression was detected by Western blot. it is known that the domain containing exons I-IV (amino acids 1\u2013161) of EAF2 cannot bind to Smad3 but the domain containing exons V-VI (amino acids 162\u2013260) of EAF2 can bind to Smad3. the presence of 50 g/ml cycloheximide (CHX) did not affect Smad3 stability. the protein level of Smad3 was not affected by overexpression of EAF2 in HEK293T cells in the presence of TGF- (2 ng/ml) the cells were treated with vehicle control vector (c) or TGF-2 (#2) after transfected for 24 h. the cells were harvested for nuclear and cytoplasmic separation. regulation of Smad3 nuclear translocation has been reported to be one of the mechanisms for modulation of Smad3 activity (19\u201326) overexpression of EAF2 could prevent Smad3 nuclear translocation in the presence of TGF- but not in the absence of TGF-. however, overexpression of EAF2 had no obvious effect on Smad2 nuclear translocation. EAF2 was expressed relatively lower in the prostate epithelium. but Smad3 expression was relatively higher in the same region (n = 3). this suggests that EAF2 might attenuate TGF- signaling by preventing Smad3 nuclear translocation. both Smad3 alone and Smad3-Smad4 combination was inhibited by overexpression of EAF2 in HEK293T cells. knockdown of EAF2 by EAF2-shRNA-2 in HaCaT cells enhanced endogenous Smad3 binding to Smad4. cipitation assays suggest that EAF2 binding disrupts Smad3-Smad4 complex formation and impairs p300 recruitment to Smad3. A1, the transactivity of Smad3 stimulated by TGF- was inhibited by overexpression of EAF2 in HepG2 cells. the cells were stimulated with TGF- (2 ng/ml) for 2h before analysis. treatment, overexpression of EAF2 in haCaT cells had no obvious effect on cell cycle. growth rate of EAF2 wild type MEF cells (EAF2+/+) was higher than that of EAF2-null MEF cells (EAF2/) AF2-null MEF cells (EAF2/) were migrated as compared with EAF2 wild type MEF cells (EAF2+/+) without TGF- treatment, no significant difference was observed in migration between EAF2 wild type MEF cells and EAF2-null MEF cells. EAF2 may represent a specific repressor of TGF- signaling solely through its effect on Smad3 activity. phosphorylation of R-Smads mediated by type I TGF receptors is a relatively early, critical step in the activation of TGF- signaling. however, the inhibitory role of EAF2 on TGF- signaling does not result from its effect on the level of TGF-induced phosphorylation of Smad3. the function of TGF- signaling in tumorigenesis is paradoxical. however, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. in the absence of TGF-, overexpression of EAF2 could actually suppress cell growth. hydrophobic corridor within the MH2 domain of Smad3 was found to be necessary for association with CAN/Nup214 and nuclear import. a similar explanation has been proposed for the effects of orphan nuclear receptor and SARS-CoV N protein on Smad3-mediated TGF- signaling. TGIF, SIP1, SNIP1, AKT, Erbin, and Zili have been shown to interact with, as well as inhibit, Smad protein transcriptional activities by interfering with the ability of CBP/p300 to interact with Smad proteins. a mechanism for EAF2 in the inhibition of TGF- signaling appears to act through disruption of p300 binding to Smad3. the way that EAF2 participate in these pathways is still unclear. phosphorylation of R-Smads mediated by type I TGF- receptors is a relatively early, critical step in the activation of TGF- signaling. however, the inhibitory role of EAF2 on TGF- signaling does not result from its effect on the level of TGF-induced phosphorylation of Smad3. in the absence of TGF-, overexpression of EAF2 could actually suppress cell growth. this is a discrepancy for EAF2 tumor suppressive function. in the absence of TGF-, overexpression of EAF2 could actually suppress cell growth. a similar explanation has been proposed for the effects of orphan nuclear receptor and SARS-CoV N protein on Smad3-mediated TGF- signaling. a number of repressors have been shown to interact specifically with Smad proteins and to increase their transcriptional activities by enhancing CBP/p300 binding. EAF2 binds to the MH2 domain of Smad3, a region implicated in CBP/p300 binding, and inhibits Smad3 transcriptional activity directly. another mechanism for EAF2 in the inhibition of TGF- signaling appears to act through disruption of p300-Smad3 binding to Smad3. binding partners involved in TGF-induced phosphorylation are often examined first (10) however, the inhibitory role of EAF2 on TGF- signaling does not result from its effect on the level of TGF-induced phosphorylation of Smad3. several Smad3-specific associated proteins have been identified, which also affects TGF- signaling. genesis, TGF- signaling promotes cancer cell progression by modulating processes such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition, evasion of immunity, and metastasis (9, 10). in the absence of TGF-, overexpression of EAF2 could actually suppress cell growth. further investigation of this phenomenon might shed new light on the function of EAF2 in tumor suppression. the association of Smad3 with Smad4 has been proposed to be essential for the activation of TGF- signaling (8\u201310). a similar explanation has been proposed for the effects of orphan nuclear receptor and SARS-CoV N protein on Smad3-mediated TGF- signaling. a region implicated in CBP/p300 binding inhibits Smad3 transcriptional activity directly. another mechanism for EAF2 in the inhibition of TGF- signaling appears to act through disruption of p300-Smad3 binding to Smad3. however, the way that EAF2 participate in these pathways is still unclear. the role of EAF2 on TGF- signaling does not result from its effect on the level of TGF-induced phosphorylation of Smad3. several Smad3-specific associated proteins have been identified, which also affects TGF- signaling through a mechanism independent of Smad3 phosphorylation. in the absence of TGF-, overexpression of EAF2 could actually suppress cell growth. further investigation of this phenomenon might shed new light on the function of EAF2 in tumor suppression. a similar explanation has been proposed for the effects of orphan nuclear receptor and SARS-CoV N protein on Smad3-mediated TGF- signaling. a number of repressors including Evi-1, Ski, SnoN, TGIF, SIP1, SNIP1, AKT, Erbin, and Zili have been shown to interact with, as well as inhibit Smad protein transcriptional activities. a mechanism for EAF2 in the inhibition of TGF- signaling appears to act through disruption of p300 binding to Smad3. however, the way that EAF2 participate in these pathways is still unclear."}
