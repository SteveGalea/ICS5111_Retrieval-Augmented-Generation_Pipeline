{"summary": "coronavirus (CoV) infections cause mild disease with upper respiratory tract and gastrointestinal symptoms. two human CoVs, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, recently emerged from zoonotic sources into the human population. efforts were made to better understand coV replication and to develop therapies and vaccines to reduce CoV-mediated morbidity and mortality. understanding of most nsp interactions comes from two-hybrid screens (13\u201315), cell-free in vitro assays (16), structural assays (17\u201319), or overexpression studies (11). to date, two CoV complexes containing nsp12, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), have been described. nsp15 contains a conserved uridine-specific endoribonuclease domain with an unknown function catalytic mutations have reduced levels of replication, as assessed by levels of infectious virus, gRNA, and subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) nsp15 also contains the only known RNA packaging signal (termed \u201cP/S\u201d herein) in lineage A -CoVs; this signal has been partiallycharacterized and contains a stem-loop structure. previous studies have shown that this region may be removed with no effect on viral titers. rA59Nsp15-HA replicated equivalently to the wild-type strain rA59WT. nsp15-HA colocalizes and interacts with coV RTC-associated proteins nsp8 and nsp12 during infection. studies have shown that the P/S can be deleted from MHV without causing significant growth defects (36). the amino acids encoded by the P/S are predicted to form a flexible loop, which is surface exposed on the monomer and hexamer of nsp15. the 3FLAG tag was likely unsuccessful due to large differences predicted in the secondary structure and Gibbs free energy of the rA59WT and the 3FLAG-containing P/S. to achieve this, we inserted the HA tag sequence into the ascending stem of the P/S and its complement into the descending stem of the P/S. rA59Nsp15-HA cells were infected with rA59Nsp15-HA or rA59WT. nsp15 levels were equivalent in rA59Nsp15-HA- and rA59WT-infected cells. this data indicated our HA tag was detectable, specific, and did not alter nsp15 expression. rA59Nsp15-HA was passaged on 17Cl-1 cells at an estimated MOI of 0.1. progeny viruses were collected at each passage and used to infect the next set of 17Cl-1 cells for serial continued passaging and immunoblotting. rA59Nsp15-HA replicated similarly compared to rA59WT. levels of sgRNA and gRNA differed by no more than 2-fold from 4 to 12 h postinfection (hpi) levels of both nsp8 and N proteins were equivalent in rA59Nsp15-HA and rA59WT-infected 17Cl-1 cells. rA59Nsp15-HA-infected cell supernatants had at least a 25-fold increase in the sgRNA/gRNA ratio. previous work demonstrated that P/S mutants and wild-type virus have identical growth kinetics, but P/S mutants are readily outcompeted by rA59WT when cells are dually infected. supernatants from rA59Nsp15-HA- and rA59WT-infected 17Cl-1 cells were collected. progeny viruses were then passaged at an estimated MOI of 0.1. cell lysates were collected at 16 hpi and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. nsp15 strongly colocalizes with nsp8 and nsp12 in rA59Nsp15-HA-infected cells throughout infection. the average Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients (PCCs) ranged from 0.84 to 0.71 for nsp8 and 0.78 to 0.53 for nsp12. however, the PCCs remained above 0.5 throughout infection. nsp15 does not localize to sites of assembly during infection. these results showed strong colocalization of nsp15 with RTCs. nsp15 does not localize to sites of assembly during infection. 17Cl-1 cells were infected with rA59Nsp15-HA or rA59WT. no proteins were immunoprecipitated in rA59Nsp15-HA- and rA59WT-infected cells. nsp12 coprecipitated with nsp8 in both rA59Nsp15-HA and rA59WT-infected cells. nsp15 interacts with the RTC proteins nsp8 and nsp12 in an RNA-independent manner. cells were infected with rA59Nsp15-HA or rA59WT at an MOI of 0.1 and collected at 20 hpi. cell lysates were immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. nuclease was active in our immunoprecipitation buffer to cleave all unprotected RNA. we found no difference in interactions between nsp8 and nsp15-HA when nuclease was present. to study the role of nsp15 during infection, we constructed an in situ tagged form of nsp15 in MHV. Mfold predicted RNA secondary structure of MHV P/S with in situ HA tag. nsp15 hexamer with each monomer is depicted with a different color. MHV nsp15 hexamer with each monomer is depicted in white. a recombinant virus containing this HA tag was created using an in vitro ligation system as previously described. nsp15-HA is expressed and is stable during serial passaging. 17Cl-1 cells were infected with rA59Nsp15-HA or rA59WT. fixed cells were costained with anti-nsp15 (green) and anti-HA (red) rA59Nsp15-HA has nearly identical replication kinetics to rA59WT. cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. the ratio of nsp15-HA to N protein was normalized to P1. rA59Nsp15-HA protein levels did not diminish over 5 passages. rA59Nsp15-HA- and rA59WT-infected 17Cl-1 cells differed by no more than 2-fold from 4 to 12 h postinfection (hpi) nsp8 and N proteins were equivalent in rA59Nsp15-HA- and rA59WT-infected 17Cl-1 cells. insertion of an HA tag into the P/S within nsp15 did not substantially affect virus rA59Nsp15-HA was rapidly outcompeted by rA59WT virus. cells were infected with 1:1 or 3:1 mixtures of rA59Nsp15-HA and rA59WT. at 16 hpi, progeny viruses were collected and subsequently used for both immunoblotting and further passaging. progeny virus from each passage was used to infect 17Cl-1 cells at an estimated MOI of 0.1. cell lysates were collected at 16 hpi and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. previously, it was shown that nsp15 localized with replicating viral RNA (10), potentially to replication compartments and with RTC members. nsp15 strongly colocalizes with nsp8 and nsp12 during infection. uninfected 17Cl-1 cells were costained with anti-nsp8 (green) and anti-HA (red) or anti-nsp12 (green) and anti-HA (red) and anti-HA (red) (B) each image is representative of at least 50 cells from two independent experiments. rabbit anti-nsp15 used rabbit anti-nsp15 to enable the use of a mouse monoclonal antibody (MAb) to M protein. at 6 and 8 hpi, most cells were syncytial, and M puncta were scattered throughout the cytoplasm and potentially the cell membrane. at all stages of infection, nsp15 did not colocalize with M protein (Fig. 5B), resulting in low PCCs of 0.3 throughout infection. 17Cl-1 cells were infected with rA59Nsp15-HA or rA59WT. no proteins were immunoprecipitated in rA59WT-infected cells. nsp15-HA protein was immunoprecipitated with nsp8 only in rA59Nsp15-HA-infected cells. cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti-HA (A), anti-nsp8 (B and D) or normal rabbit serum (NRS) (B) cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the indicated antibodies. nsp15-HA is completely conserved among CoVs and is known to have endoribonu. nsp15 localized with replicating RNA (10), but its localization and interactions with other viral proteins were previously unknown. we found strong colocalization of nsp15 with nsp8 and nsp12. nsp15 interacted with two markers of the RTC, nsp8 and nsp12. p8 antibody only coprecipitated a small fraction of the respective binding partner. nsp15 has multiple functions, only one of which requires interaction with other nsps. nsp15 only transiently interacts with the RTC before completing its function. the pentaloop and the remaining 2-bp bulge are not sufficient for selective packaging. however, it remains possible that they are necessary for some degree of selective packaging. this may explain why the HA tag sequence was stable, whereas the FLAG tag sequence was quickly lost following passaging of the virus. further work is required to determine what factors within the P/S are important for selective packaging of genomic RNA. rA59Nsp15-HA was introduced into the F plasmid of the A59 in vitro ligation system. the plasmid was linearized and homologous arms were added. the plasmid was recombined using In-Fusion (Clontech) cDNA clone used to develop recombinant rA59Nsp15-HA and rA59WT. unless otherwise stated, 17Cl-1 cells were infected with the indicated viruses at an MOI of 0.1 for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. cellular hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) RNA levels were measured by quantitative PCR (qPCR) with the indicated primers. levels of gRNA and sgRNA were normalized to HPRT by the following threshold cycle (CT) equation: CT = CT of gene of interest CT of HPRT. monolayers were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. cells were then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline. cells were stained with indicated primary antibodies for 3 h at room temperature. phosphatase inhibitors (Roche, Basal, Switzerland), -mercaptoethanol, and Pierce Universal Nuclease (Thermo Fisher Scientific) gels were transferred overnight at 30 V to polyacrylamide gels. membranes were blocked with 5% milk in PBS or Odyssey blocking buffer (Li-Cor) nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation (16,000 g for 15 min at 4\u00b0C) and applied to protein G Dynabeads. beads were washed with PBS-Tween before elution with 2 SDS sample buffer at 95\u00b0C for 5 min. plasmid was recombined using In-Fusion (Clontech) according to manufacturer\u2019s protocol. MHV-A59 fragments were digested and ligated as previously reported. cDNA clone used to develop recombinant rA59Nsp15-HA and rA59WT P0 viruses. rA59Nsp15-HA P1 viruses were passaged on 17Cl-1 cells at an initial MOI of 0.1. each subsequent passage was collected at maximum CPE. stocks of each virus were used to infect 17Cl-1 cells and collected for immunoblotting. cell supernatants were collected at 16 hpi from 1.5 107 17Cl-1 cells infected with rA59WT or rA59Nsp15-HA at an MOI of 0.1. supernatants were centrifuged at 1,000 rpm to remove cellular debris and then passed through a 45-m-pore filter. viral RNA was isolated using Trizol. goat anti-mouse 568 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were used 1:500 in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. cells were washed before mounting with Vectashield antifade reagent (Vector Laboratories) immunoblots were washed with 0.1% Tween in PBS. cells were infected with either rA59WT or rA59Nsp15-HA. cell pellets were lysed with IP buffer. unpaired t test or Mann-Whitney U test was used to analyze differences in mean values. all results are expressed as means range or standard error of the mean."}
