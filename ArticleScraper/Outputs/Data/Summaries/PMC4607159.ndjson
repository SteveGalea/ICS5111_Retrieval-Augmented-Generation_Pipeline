{"summary": "acute kidney injury (AKI) is the most frequent complication in patients receiving ECMO. few studies have been conducted on the risk factors of AKI. ECMO enables an efficient oxygenation and elimination of carbon dioxide. a number of complications could impinge upon the potential benefit of ECMO. acute kidney injury (AKI) is the most frequently reported problem. retrospective cohort study performed in adult patients who were 15 years or older receiving ECMO support. a total of 681 patients consecutively received ECMO support from January 2005 to November 2014. 322 patients were ultimately analyzed in the present study. initial blood findings, including blood urea nitrogen (BUN), total bilirubin, albumin, white blood cells, hemoglobin level, platelet number, red cell distribution width (RDW), sodium, potassium, chloride, and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured. worst values during first 24 h before ECMO initiation were used. the difference was analyzed by an independent t-test in continuous variables and chi-square test in categorical variables. for the estimated survival, the Kaplan-Meier method was employed. logistic regression analysis for AKI and Cox-proportional hazard analysis for in-hospital mortality were carried out. 322 patients were ultimately analyzed in the present study. if they had end-stage renal disease or their initial serum creatinine levels were above 353.6 mol/L (n = 13) if they had been receiving continuous renal replacement therapy on the date of ECMO insertion (n = 77) the maximum AKI stage reached during ECMO support was used to define the incidence of AKI [17]. in-hospital mortality was determined whether a death certificate had been issued or not at 90 d after ECMO insertion. the reasons for admission were cardiovascular disease (203, 63.0%), lung disease (49, 15.2%), malignancy (35, 10.9%) and others (35, 10.9%). one hundred and thirty seven (42.5%) patients had received ECMO insertion within 24 h prior to ECMO initiation. ECMO, use of IABP, length of stay before ECMO insertion, initial urine output, BUN, creatinine, RDW and CRP were associated with in-hospital mortality. compared to the non-AKI group, the stage 3 AKI group significantly increased the risk of in-hospital mortality whereas the stage 1 and 2 AKI groups did not. the cut-off values of SAPS2, serum sodium level, and ECMO pump speed for in-hospital mortality were a score of 69.5, 147.6 mmol/L, and 2.19 x 103 rpm, respectively.
