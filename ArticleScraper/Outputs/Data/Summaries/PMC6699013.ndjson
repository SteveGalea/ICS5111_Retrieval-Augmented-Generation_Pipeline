{"summary": "a 4-year-old male neutered cat was presented with a 2-month history of intermittent constipation that progressed to obstipation. primary clinical findings included a large, multi lobulated mass in the caudodorsal abdomen, peripheral eosinophilia and hyperglobulinemia. the cat was negative for FeLV/FIV but positive for Bartonella species. the cat was prescribed azithromycin (9.1 mg/kg PO q24h for 1 month. no pain was elicited on abdominal palpation. the sublumbar mass was palpable on rectal examination. results of laboratory analysis revealed a leukocytosis of 24.2 K/l. the mass measured approximately 10 cm 3 cm in the right lateral abdominal view. the colon contained a large amount of heterogeneous feces and gas. the mass was moderately vascular on color Doppler in the areas surrounding the center of the mass. the cat was pre-medicated with fentanyl (5 g/kg IV; Hospira) and general anesthesia was maintained with propofol (4 mg/kg/h IV; Hospira) the cat received perioperative intravenous crystalloids (5 ml/kg/h IV; Hospira) and ampicillin/sulbactam (30 mg/kg IV q90mins [Un. multiple firm, round soft tissue masses were palpated just dorsal to the colon in the sublumbar region extending into the pelvic canal. each mass was white to pale pink, measured 2\u20133 cm in diameter, and was adhered to adjacent masses and the surrounding soft tissues by multiple fibrous adhesions. the cat was treated with lactulose (0.5 g/kg PO q8h), ampicillin/sulbactam (30 mg/kg IV q8h) until transitioned to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (PO 62.5 mg/cat) at the time of discharge, the cat was comfortable, eating, drinking and urinating normally. otic figures were noted in the fibroblasts. some aggregates contained Gram-positive cocci. no other microorganisms were detected with Gram stain or Giemsa stain. trabecular or capsular fibrosis was more severe and infiltrated by eosinophils. aerobic culture grew many Staphylococcus aureus, with susceptibility to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (minimum inhibitory concentration = 0.25) cat was prescribed long-term prednisolone therapy for 1 month. physical examination revealed a body condition score of 4/9 and 0.7 kg weight gain. abdominal palpation revealed no mass, while rectal palpation revealed a persistent firm mass dorsally. repeat abdominal CT with triple-phase contrast and 1.2 mm slice thickness was performed. cats ranging in age from 14 weeks to >16 years may be over-represented. clinical signs commonly include chronic vomiting and/or diarrhea, weight loss, lethargy and anorexia. biopsies sampled from a cat\u2019s caudal abdominal mass were consistent with previously reported histologic findings. inherited eosinophil dysregulation, food hypersensitivity, penetrating wound from a migrating foreign body, herpesvirus infection or bacterial infection. certain cats may be genetically predisposed to significant eosinophilic inflammation in response to antigenic stimulation. cats with distal lesions tend to have longer survival times than those with pyloric lesions. despite bacterial involvement in the majority of cases, antibiotics appear to be ineffective and have not been shown to increase survival time. in which FGESF has been noted to occur, characterizes the appearance of FGESF on CT, shows that FGESF cannot be ruled out solely owing to an extra-mural location of an abdominal mass. indicates that patients with FGESF can have a good quality of life, and potentially equivalent survival times with medical management alone."}
