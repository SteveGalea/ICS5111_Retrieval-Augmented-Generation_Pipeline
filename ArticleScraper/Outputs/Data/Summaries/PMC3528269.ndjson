{"summary": "the filoviridae family comprises two genera, Ebolavirus (the ebolaviruses) and Marburgvirus (the marburgviruses) the genus marburgvirus includes a single species, Marburg marburgvirus (MARV) and Ravn virus (RAVV) RESTV seems to be apathogenic [6,7,8]. the entry of filoviruses into target cells is the first essential step in the viral life cycle. the viral glycoprotein (GP) is the only viral envelope protein and thus constitutes the sole target for the neutralizing antibody response. insights into multiple, sequential interactions of GP with host cell factors required for cellular entry can define novel targets for therapeutic inhibition. filoviral GP is synthesized as a precursor protein, GP0, in the secretory pathway of infected cells. subtilisin-like proprotein convertases process the precursor protein into two subunits, the surface unit GP1 and the transmembrane unit GP2. a mucin-like region (MLR) at the C-terminus of GP1 is extensively modified by O-linked glycans. class I membrane fusion proteins form metastable trimers perpendicular to the viral membrane. each monomer consist of an N-terminal surface subunit, which contains a receptor-binding domain, and a C-terminal transmembrane unit inserted in the viral membrane. the membrane fusion involves a major conformation rearrangement of the transmembrane unit. GP1 and GP2 are separated by a protease sensitive site. the furin consensus site is dispensable for cellular entry. a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminal HR sequence of EBOV-GP2 inhibited EBOV and MARV infection. filamentoviral GP is synthesized as a precursor protein, GP0, in the secretory pathway of infected cells. GP1-GP2 heterodimers are inserted into the cellular and the viral membrane. fusion loop curls around the outside of GP1 [37,45,55] ral GP1,2 is heavily glycosylated and harbors numerous consensus sites for N-linked glycosylation and GP1 glycosylation. a mucin-like region (MLR) at the C-terminus of GP1 is highly variable among filovirus species. the MLR is dispensable for entry into cell lines, as lentiviral vectors bearing GP1,2 mutants with a deleted MLR show comparable or even enhanced capacity to transduce certain cell the membrane fusion involves a major conformation rearrangement of the transmembrane unit, resulting in the formation of a characteristic, highly stable trimer-of-hairpins with a central -helical coiled-coil. the glycoproteins are synthesized as inactive precursor proteins, which are primed for membrane fusion by proteolytic processing. the furin consensus site is dispensable for cellular entry. the transmembrane unit GP2 contains an N-terminal fusion loop and two HRs. a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminal HR sequence of EBOV-GP2 inhibited both EBOV and MARV infection. several host cell factors are involved in priming and triggering of filovirus GP1,2 for membrane fusion. the cellular molecules involved in filovirus entry govern the spectrum of cells susceptible to filovirus infection. the only cells refractory to the otherwise pantropic filoviruses are lymphocytes. experiments with pseudotypes showed that these cells are not susceptible to GP1,2-driven host cell entry. a virus entry receptor is usually defined as a cellular binding partner of a viral GP which is essential for infectious viral entry into host cells. surface molecule TIM-1 interacts with GP1,2 inserted in the viral membrane. virions are internalized via macropinocytosis into the endosomal compartment. a so far incompletely understood stimulus triggers the membrane fusion activity in GP2. glycosylated MLR dispensable for GP1,2 binding to DCSIGN and DCSIGNR [92]. deletion of the MLR impedes interactions with hMGL, which recognizes terminal galactose-/N-acetylgalactosamine [41,50,93] TIM-1 is a type I membrane glycoprotein with an extracellular IgV domain and a mucin-like domain predicted to be heavily O-glycosylated [106]. TIM-1 is expressed on activated T-cells, epithelial. cells, conjunctiva and renal tissue [105,109,110] as well as certain cell lines including the liver cell line Huh7 [105]. soluble TIM-1 was shown to block EBOV-GP1,2-driven filovirus entry. TIM-1 promotes filovirus infection of certain cell lines. but macrophages and dendritic cells lack TIM-1 expression. ectopic expression of Axl and the TAM may contribute to filovirus GP-mediated cellular uptake. TK and MER on lymphoid cells allowed for transduction of GP1,2-harboring pseudotypes. both the extracellular ligand binding domain and the cytoplasmic tail of Axl were required for efficient GP1,2-mediated entry. a role of TAM family proteins in filovirus entry was confirmed by an independent study. integrin family comprises eighteen and eight subunits which can assemble into 24 different heterodimers [139] integrins are cell surface expressed heterodimeric type I transmembrane glycoproteins, which are composed of two non-covalently linked subunits. soluble recombinant \u00df1 integrin or \u00df1-reactive antibodies diminish GP1,2 driven entry, suggesting that GP1,2 might need to engage \u00df1 integrins for infectious entry. a direct interaction between EBOV-GP1,2 and integrins remains to be demonstrated. low pH (5.5\u20134) environment of late endosomes activates membrane fusion proteins of influenza, bunya and dengue viruses. some viruses require both low pH and receptor engagement as triggers for membrane fusion. others require both low pH and receptor engagement as triggers for membrane fusion. study demonstrating that filoviruses are activated by endo/lysosomal cysteine proteases. the low pH environment present in the latter compartment is essential for cathepsin enzymatic activity. cathepsins B and L cleave filovirus GP1,2 and cathepsin activity is essential for GP1,2-driven host cell entry. a two-step model was proposed, suggesting that GP1,2 must first be processed by cathepsins B and L before the activity of a third lysosomal factor triggers GP1,2-dependent membrane fusion [56,171]. a cleavage of GP1,2 removes a glycan cap and the MLR while the N-terminal RBR and GP2 remain in the molecule. a requirement for cathepsin B activity during entry of EBOV-, TAFV- and BDBV-but not SUDV-, RESTV and MARV-GP-bearing pseudotypes has been described. however, entry of RESTV was dependent on a cysteine protease distinct from cathepsins B and L [125]. many studies investigating the role of cathepsins in filovirus host cell entry were performed with GP1,2bearing vectors. it is also noteworthy that many studies investigating the role of cathepsins in filovirus host cell entry were performed with GP1,2bearing vectors and not with authentic filoviruses. EBOV-GP1,2-dependent entry harbored a defect in the NPC1 gene. the protein is highly conserved among species and is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues. mutations in the NPC1 gene result in fatal, progressive neurodegenerative disorder, Niemann-Pick C1 disease. the protein is localized on the endosomal and lysosomal membranes. it was proposed to act downstream of filovirus GP1,2 engagement of attachment. GP1,2-mediated viral uptake was readily detectable in NPC1-deficient cells. hepatitis C virus entry mediated by the NPC1-like 1 protein was dependent on cholesterol uptake. no evidence for an interaction between hepatitis C virus and NPC1-like 1 protein has been reported so far. glycosylated MLR dispensable for GP1,2 binding to DCSIGN and DCSIGNR. deletion of the MLR impedes interactions with hMGL. differences in lectin engagement among the ebolavirus species and MARV have been noted. TIM-1 is a type I membrane glycoprotein with an extracellular IgV domain and a mucin-like domain predicted to be heavily O-glycosylated. TIM-1 is expressed on activated T-cells, epithelial cells, conjunctiva and renal tissue. cell lines including the liver cell line Huh7 [105] are permissive for filovirus replication. soluble TIM-1 was shown to block EBOV-GP1,2-driven infection. a physical interaction between receptor binding domain of EBOV-GP1 and soluble TIM-1 could be demonstrated. dendritic cells lack TIM-1 expression [110], suggesting that so far unidentified cellular factors facilitate filovirus entry into these cells. the cellular lectins DC-SIGN, DC-SIGNR, LSECtin, ASPGR-1 and hMGL [41,85,86,87,88,89] can promote filovirus entry into transfected cells. s and dendritic cells (hMGL, DC-SIGN) [94,95], hepatocytes (ASGPR-1) [96] and liver and lymph node sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECtin, DC-SIGNR) [97,98] suggest that they could modulate filovirus spread in the infected host. there is currently little evidence that endogenous lectin expression appreciably augments filovirus entry into primary target cells TIM-1 is a type I membrane glycoprotein with an extracellular IgV domain and a mucin-like domain predicted to be heavily O-glycosylated. TIM-1 is expressed on activated T-cells, epithelial cells, conjunctiva and renal tissue [105,109,110] and certain cell lines including the liver cell line Huh7 [105] soluble TIM-1 was shown to block EBOV-GP1,2-driven infection. a physical interaction between receptor binding domain of EBOV-GP1 and soluble TIM-1 could be demonstrated [105], suggesting that TIM-1 indeed promotes filovirus infection of certain cell lines. ligands for TAM receptors are the structurally homologous proteins Gas6 and protein S. these secreted proteins bind to phosphatidylserine residues exposed by apoptotic cells. ligand-activated TAM receptors have been found to inhibit inflammation pathways in macrophages. EBOV-GP1,2-faciliated entry was dependent on Axl expression. but down-regulation of Axl expression in other cell lines did not compromise GP1,2-driven entry. inhibition of Axl and blockade of PIK3 inhibit filovirus entry in a cell type-dependent fashion. heterodimers convey specificity to cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix adhesion, immune cell recruitment, extravasation, and signaling events. the association with viral surface proteins and microbial pathogens are followed by multiple signaling events. it is not surprising that numerous viruses hijack integrins for infectious entry, as they are widely expressed in various tissues throughout the body. 51-integrin indirectly promotes GP1,2-driven entry by ensuring activity of GP1,2-priming cysteine proteases or by stimulating the protease maturation pathway, which might be required for viral entry. if physical interactions of GP1,2 with 51-integrin also contribute to filovirus entry remains to be determined. ectopic expression of Axl and the TAM family members DTK and MER on lymphoid cells allowed for transduction of GP1,2-harboring pseudotypes. expression of mRNA encoding for Axl correlates with susceptibility of cell lines to EBOV infection [114,115,117] ocytosis and Axl-dependent signaling inhibit filovirus entry in a cell type-dependent fashion. recombinant Gas6 can promote Sindbis virus entry by bridging phosphatidylserine present in the viral envelope to Axl localized on target cells. expression of EBOV-GP1,2 was initially shown to interfere with surface expression of various cellular membrane proteins. however, a more recent study suggested that GP1,2 expression does not reduce cell surface levels of integrins but rather sterically occludes epitopes in these proteins otherwise recognized by antibodies. soluble recombinant \u00df1 integrin or \u00df1-reactive antibodies diminish GP1,2 driven entry, suggesting that GP1,2 might need to engage \u00df viral GPs are synthesized as inactive precursor proteins which transit into a membrane fusion-competent state only upon proteolytic cleavage by host cell proteases. the subtilisin-like proprotein convertase furin is responsible for priming of several viral GPs in the Golgi apparatus of infected cells. GP0 of all filoviruses excluding RESTV harbors an incomplete furin recognition site. study demonstrates that filoviruses are activated by endo/lysosomal cysteine proteases. the low pH environment present in the latter compartment is essential for cathepsin enzymatic activity. cathepsins B and L prime filovirus GP1,2 for membrane fusion. a two-step model for GP1,2 activation has been proposed by subsequent studies. the 19 kDa form represents a metastable conformation in which the fusion machinery is not yet exposed [37,172,173,174] and which can be triggered for membrane fusion by low pH and reduction. cathepsin B and L prime GP1,2 for membrane fusion and exposes the RBR. despite the importance of cathepsin B and L in priming EBOV-GP1,2 for membrane fusion in several cell lines, the dependence on these particular proteases for viral entry is not universal among filoviruses. MARV-GP1,2-facilitated entry was not blocked efficiently by cathepsin B/L inhibitors, suggesting that MARV-GP1,2 might employ a so far unknown protease for priming in macrophages. many studies investigating the role of cathepsins in filovirus host cell entry were performed with GP1,2bearing vectors. a recent study found that CHO cells selected for resistance to EBOV-GP1,2-dependent entry harbored a defect in the NPC1 gene. the protein is highly conserved among species and is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, with the highest expression in the liver. mutations in the NPC1 gene result in fatal, progressive neurodegenerative disorder, Niemann-Pick C1 disease. heterozygous NPC1/+ mice were protected against filovirus infection in sharp contrast to wild type mice. GP1,2-mediated viral uptake was readily detectable in NPC1-deficient cells. cleaved 19 kDa form binds to second luminal domain of NPC1 [130] the cholesterol-transport inhibitor interfered with hepatitis C and dengue virus (strain TSV01) infection [189,190], and a factor with 40% amino acid identity to NPC1 (named NPC1-like 1) was shown to be involved in uptake of hepatitis C virus mediated by the NPC1-like 1 protein. no evidence for an interaction between hepatitis C virus and NPC1-like 1 protein has been reported. cathepsins B and L cleave filovirus GP1,2 into an 18 kDa form. the 18 kDa form is processed by cathepsin B and cleaved into an 18 kDa form. cleavage may be sufficient to trigger membrane fusion. a two-step model was proposed, suggesting that GP1,2 must first be processed by cathepsins B and L. a third lysosomal factor, potentially a thiol reductase, triggers GP1,2-dependent membrane fusion [56,171]. the 19 kDa form represents a metastable conformation in which the fusion machinery is not yet exposed. cleavage of GP1,2 removes a glycan cap and the MLR, while the N-terminal RBR and GP2 remain in the molecule. ebolavirus GP1,2-driven entry into vero cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts can be overcome by ectopic expression of CatB. a protease other than CatL is required for a post-CatB cleavage step necessary for membrane fusion. integrins previously suggested to promote filovirus entry is required for activity of cathepsin B and L [123], indicating an intricate interplay between some of the host cell molecules exploited by filoviruses. a recent study found that CHO cells selected for resistance to EBOV-GP1,2-dependent entry harbored a defect in the NPC1 gene [183] NPC1-deficient cells, including primary fibroblasts derived from NPC1 patients, were resistant to filovirus infection, but still allowed for efficient cellular entry of several other viruses. transduction of the wild type NPC1 gene into NPC1-defective, patient-derived cells or NPC1-negative CHO cells fully restored infection [20,129] fusion of pseudotypes bearing the primed 19 kDa GP1,2 with the plasma membrane of target cells could not be induced by low pH treatment. however, binding of primed GP1,2 to NPC1 is not sufficient to trigger membrane fusion. flaviviruses have also been found to depend on molecules involved in cholesterol transport for infectious entry into host cells. cellular lectins can concentrate vectors bearing GP1,2 at the cellular surface. lectin expression usually does not render cells susceptible to GP1,2-driven entry. a role of lectins in the cell tropism of filoviruses in the infected host remains to be demonstrated."}
