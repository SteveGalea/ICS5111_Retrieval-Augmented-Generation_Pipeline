{"summary": "lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) is a natural infectious agent of mice. it causes widespread and very rapid but transient activation of both B cells and T cells in lymphoid tissues and the blood. the mechanism of this activation has not been fully described. coronaviruses such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus cause very rapid lytic infections generally restricted to a minor subset of non-essential macrophages involved in scavenging extracellular lactate dehydrogenase [5], [2], [3], [4]. titers peak within the first day of infection as susceptible target cells are depleted, and then the infection is maintained at a much lower chronic level dependent on the replenishment of new macrophage expression of CD69 was analyzed by flow cytometry as previously described. the induction occurred on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, as well as B cells. in contrast, no significant upregulation was observed on lymphocytes from the blood, lymph nodes, and bone marrow. lymphocytes from spleen, blood, lymph nodes, bone marrow and thymus were examined at 16hpi with LDV. all tissues except the thymus showed a significantly higher percentage of CD69hi lymphocytes when infected with LDV infected. pDC's are uniquely able to secrete high levels of IFN in response to endocytosed antigen. the plasma IFN response at 16 hours post-infection was abolished by pDC depletion. the systemic IFN response was predominantly due to production by pDC's. in vivo upregulation of CD69 on lymphocytes is likely due to the systemic IFN. the loss of the IFN response in pDC-depleted mice produced no statistically significant difference in LDV plasma levels. the difference between the two groups was statistically significant by t test (P0.0001, n = 5). pDC depletion did not significantly alter LDV levels in plasma as indicated by results from semiquantitative real-time RT-PCR as previously described [16]. pDC depletion did not significantly alter LDV levels in plasma as indicated by results from semiquantitative real-time RT-PCR as previously described [16]. pDC depletion did not significantly alter LDV levels in plasma. values in TLR7+/+ mice averaged 795.5 pg/ml. only trace amounts of IFN were detected in TLR7/ mice. low levels of IFN in mice correlated with reduced percentages of lymphocytes expressing CD69. IFN-induced partial activation may promote adaptive immune responses by lowering the threshold for full activation once antigen-specific recognition occurs. if so, IFN may be a very important regulatory link between the innate and adaptive immune responses."}
