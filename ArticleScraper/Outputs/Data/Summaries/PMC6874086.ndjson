{"summary": "mammalian endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) mediates scission of membrane stalks formed when membrane-bound vesicles bud from their parent membranes. these reverse topology membrane biogenesis events are distinct from membrane budding events toward the cytoplasm, such as endocytosis. the ESCRT pathway functions in a variety of endogenous cellular processes including multivesicular body formation [3\u20135], shedding of microvesicles ubiquitinated endosomal cargo proteins bind the ubiquitin binding domains in the ESCRT-0 complex [19\u201321] a wide range of viruses also use the ESCRT scission machinery to facilitate release of new virions. viral adaptor proteins encode short peptides called late domains that mediate the recruitment of ESCRT proteins. ALIX is capable of binding to both the ESCRT-III complex or to Tsg101. the link between FPIV and PPXY late domains and the ESCRT complexes is unclear. PPXY domains, however, can directly bind to the WW domains found in Nedd4 family E3 ubiquitin ligases. the ubiquitin ligase activity of Nedd4 family proteins is required for efficient virus particle egress for filoviruses [38, 50, 51], human leukemia virus [40, 52], murine leukemia virus [53, 54] and Rous Sarcoma virus [42]. identification of the cellular proteins hijacked by viral proteins to accomplish their various functions is critical for enhancing our understanding of basic viral processes. a total of 744 cellular proteins were identified as partners of LCMV and LASV Z. four Nedd4 family ubiquitin ligases were identified as partners of Z. loss of Nedd4 family ligases inhibited release of LCMV DI particles. 192 proteins were identified in both independent experiments. overall sensitivity of detection was significantly greater than the first. a total of 143 proteins were identified in virions. the coomassie stained gel was processed for mass spectrometry as described in the Methods. the flow diagram shows the sucrose banding- and mass spectrometry-based approach to detect host proteins in LCMV particles. a relatively small proportion of the total LCMV or LASV Z protein partners were identified in both the VLP and intracellular interactomes. a network map of the protein-protein interactions between either LCMV or LASV Z was generated using Cytoscape 3.2.1 software. only proteins identified in both biological replicate experiments are depicted on the map. protein classes enriched in the LCMV or LASV Z VLP (A) or intracellular (B) interactomes met high stringency cutoff for LASV Z. proteins enriched in LCMV virions are also shown (A) the PPXY late domain in the Z protein recruits proteins containing WW domains. ESCRT proteins were strongly enriched within the LCMV and LASV Z VLP and intracellular interactomes. odds ratio estimates ranging from 7 to 22. odds ratio for enrichment of WW domains in the intracellular LASV Z interactome was a moderate 3.92. p-value for enrichment was 0.053 (losing significance after adjusting for multiple comparisons) only 54 WW proteins are annotated in the human genome. affinity purification followed by western blotting confirmed that ITCH, WWP1 and Nedd4 all co-purified with WT LCMV Z. the interaction of LCMV Z proteins lacking intact PPXY late domains with these Nedd4 family proteins was drastically reduced. tagged ubiquitin were expressed via plasmid in HEK293T cells. two days later Z was affinity purified with streptavidin beads. both Z and ubiquitin were detected via two color fluorescent western blotting using anti-SBP and anti-HA antibodies. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing LCMV Z and HA-tagged ubiquitin. days later the cells were lysed and Z was affinity purified with streptavidin beads. ubiquitin and Z were detected by two color fluorescent western blotting. plasmids expressing LCMV Z and hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged ubiquitin were co-transfected into HEK293T cells with HA-tagged ubiquitin. Z was affinity purified with streptavidin beads and then Z and ubiquitin were detected by two-color fluorescent western blotting. weight shift is readily observed in the red channel (HA-ubiquitin) with the StrepII-tagged Z relative to the SBP-tagged Z that correlate with the molecular weight differences conferred by the affinity tags. however, some higher molecular weight bands in the red channel also appear to be shifted in size and thus may correspond to ubiquitinated Z. PPXY-Nedd4 ubiquitin ligases are responsible for ubiquitination of LCMV Z. the ubiquitin-binding protein HGS/Hrs is required for the release of LCMV DI and infectious particles. the ESCRT-0 protein Hrs (official gene symbol HGS) consistently interacted with intracellular LCMV and LASV Z. knockdown resulted in a significant reduction in LCMV infectious release. production of DI particles was inhibited to a greater extent. loss of TOM1 also resulted in a modest, but statistically significant decrease. lysine 10 (K10) and lysine 77 (K77) are the only two lysine residues in Z that can be efficiently ubiquitinated. mutation of the two lysine residues predicted to be ubiquitinated in LCMV Z did not alter Z-Ub levels. no individual lysine mutation resulted in decreased levels of Z-Ub. lysine mutants were ubiquitinated at lysines 10 and 77. lysine mutants were transfected into HEK293T cells. lysine mutants were mutated to arginine, LCMV Z-NoK. LCMV Z cannot be ubiquitinated (KK10/77RR) was deficient in its ability to interact with ESCRT protein VPS4. LCMV Z that cannot be ubiquitinated (KK10/77RR) was deficient in its ability to interact with VPS4. HEK293T cells were transfected with an empty vector or a vector encoding SBP-tagged LCMV Z with the indicated mutations. the quantity of co-purified VPS4 in the fluorescent western blots in (A) was quantitated using Licor Image Studio software and divided by the quantity of affinity purified monomeric Z. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing HA-tagged ubiquitin and SBP-tagged WT or NoK LCMV Z. the western blots shown are representative of three independent experiments. the graphs in (B) and (D) represent the mean values SEM of three independent experiments. a statistically significant but modest decrease in infectious or DI particles in the supernatant was observed for viruses containing either the double mutant (KK10-77RR) or the mutated late domain. a virus-like particle release assay described previously was used to measure the contribution of Z ubiquitination to virus release. a two-way ANOVA with Holm-Sidak\u2019s test for multiple comparisons was used to compare the log-transformed mean titer values from the growth curve in (A-B) the release of virus-like particles (VLPs) from HEK293T cells transfected with plasmids expressing SBP-tagged LCMV Z protein with the indicated mutations was measured. the knockdown of WWP1 specifically reduced the production of LCMV DI particles, but not did not affect production of infectious virions. ITCH and WWP1, but not Nedd4 or HGS, are required for virus release. infectious titers and DI particle titers were measured from the cell culture supernatant collected two days after infection. compound #5 reduced LCMV DI particle titers but did not impact infectious virus. a total of 744 cellular proteins were identified as partners of LCMV Z and 824 proteins for LASV Z in at least one independent experiment. a total of 615 host proteins were identified in LCMV VLPs and 305 co-purified with intracellular LCMV Z from two independent experiments. the overall sensitivity of detection for the second independent experiment appeared to be significantly greater than the first. virions of LCMV strain Armstrong 53b produced in vero E6 cells were sucrose-banded and then subjected to lysis followed by protein gel electrophoresis. the resulting peptides identified by the mass spectrometer were compared to a human protein database. several key proteins were found in both categories. Fig 2 illustrates the proteins identified with either LCMV or LASV Z purified from cells or VLPs. a relatively small proportion of the total LCMV or LASV Z protein partners were identified in both the VLP and intracellular interactomes. however, a significant number of protein interactions were conserved between the two virus species. Ribosomal proteins were the most highly enriched proteins in VLPs and LCMV virions. virions resembled host ribosomes and for which the virus family was named. virions were enriched in WD repeat, HEAT repeat, DEAD/DEAH box, and tetratricopeptide repeat. all human proteins that are part of the ESCRT pathway (C), contain PPXY (D), P(S/T)AP (E) or YPX(1,3)L (F) late domains, or contain WW domains (G) were identified and cross-referenced with the Z interactome and LCMV virion content. ESCRT proteins were strongly enriched within the LCMV and LASV Z VLP and intracellular interactomes. odds ratio estimates ranging from 7 to 22. the odds ratio for enrichment of WW domains in the intracellular LASV Z interactome was a moderate 3.92. Nedd4 family ubiquitin ligases interact with LCMV Z via its PPXY late domain. no Nedd4 family ubiquitin ligases were identified likely due to the fact that JUNV Z encoded only a P(S/T)AP late domain and not the PPXY late domain found in Old World mammarenaviruses. LCMV Z is directly ubiquitinated on lysine residues by Nedd4 family ubiquitin ligases. plasmids expressing either WT or lysine-free (NoK) LCMV Z have affinity tags of different molecular weights. HEK293T cells were co-transfected with LCMV Z and ubiquitin. two days later the cells were lysed and Z was affinity purified with streptavidin beads. urea was added to the cell lysate to a concentration of 8M and incubated for 1 hour. western blotting was used to detect non-covalently interacting host proteins. the quantity of the Z-Ub bands in the fluorescent western blots in (F) were quantified using Licor Image Studio software. a one-way ANOVA with Holm-Sidak\u2019s test for multiple comparisons was used to compare the mean values to the WT DMSO condition. the dimeric form of Z has been shown to exhibit resistance to denaturing conditions previously [85], but a band of protein near 32 kDa was present in both the Z and ubiquitin channels. conditions under which the affinity purification was performed were equivalent to those used in the initial proteomics screen. a plasmid expressing WT LCMV Z with a smaller, Strep tag II affinity tag was transfected into HEK293T cells with HA-tagged urea treatment eliminated the interaction between Z and the cellular proteins IMPDH2 and ATP5B, but the Z-ubiquitin species was retained. we hypothesized that these ligases could be responsible for the observed ubiquitination of LCMV Z. ubiquitin-binding protein HGS/Hrs is required for release of LCMV DI and infectious particles. ubiquitin-binding, ESCRT-0 protein HGS is required during mammarenavirus infection. many of the proteins found were ESCRT proteins including the ESCRT-I proteins MVB12A, UBAP1 and Tsg101. the ESCRT-0 protein Hrs (official gene symbol HGS) also consistently interacted with intracellular LCMV and LASV Z. lysine residues at position 5 and 10 were the only residues predicted to be ubiquitin acceptor sites. lysine residues at position 5 and 10 were the only residues predicted to be ubiquitin acceptor sites. lysine 10 (K10) and lysine 77 (K77) are the only two lysine residues in each Z plasmid that can be efficiently ubiquitinated. lysine 10 (K10) and lysine 77 (K77) are the only two lysine residues in each Z plasmid that can be efficiently ubiquitinated. plasmid expressing HA-tagged ubiquitin (HA-Ub) and LCMV Z or an empty vector were transfected into HEK293T cells. lysine mutant Z constructs contained only one intact lysine residue indicated, or no intact lysines (NoK) each panel is representative of at least 3 independent experiments. LCMV Z that cannot be ubiquitinated (KK10/77RR) was deficient in its ability to interact with VPS4A/B. after affinity purification, the levels of VPS4A/B normalized to levels of affinity purified Z were 54% less compared to WT Z. an even more substantial defect was observed with the lysine-free LCMV Z mutant (NoK) HEK293T cells were transfected with an empty vector or a vector encoding SBP-tagged LCMV Z with the indicated mutations. the quantity of co-purified VPS4 in the fluorescent western blots in (A) was quantitated using Licor Image Studio software and divided by the quantity of affinity purified monomeric Z. production of both infectious and DI particles was significantly reduced for rLCMV containing lysine-free Z-NoK (Fig 8A, 8B and 8C) growth kinetics of the late domain mutant rLCMV (PPPY/AAAA) were similar to that of the PPPY/PPPF mutant previously published. no difference between WT and Z-KK10/77RR or the lysine free mutant were observed, while the PPPY late domain mutation significantly reduced VLP release. together these results suggest that direct ubiquitination of LCMV Z has little impact on the ability of LCMV Z to drive budding in a VLP assay. tagged LCMV Z protein with the indicated mutations was measured. a one-way ANOVA with Holm-Sidak\u2019s test for multiple comparisons was used to compare the mean values to the WT control in (D-F) ITCH and WWP1 are critical for LCMV release. HEK293T cells were reverse transfected with small interfering (si)RNAs to the indicated targets or a non-targeting control siRNA then two days later were infected with LCMV and cells and virus-containing cell culture media were collected after an additional two days. expression of siRNA-targeted proteins, the viral nucleoprotein (NP) and actin was measured in cells by western blot. LCMV infected cells were treated with PPXY-Nedd4 inhibitor compound #4. compound #5 reduced LCMV DI particle titers but did not impact infectious virus. a VLP release assay was also employed demonstrating the compound #4 inhibits both LCMV and LASV Z VLP release. domains recruit ESCRT proteins by Nedd4-mediated ubiquitination of the viral protein containing the late domain. we demonstrated that these ligases ubiquitinate LCMV Z and pinpoint the two lysine residues in LCMV Z that are targeted. we suggest that direct ubiquitination of Z is dispensable for virus release and other functions. LP release suggests at least some of these ligases are required during mammarenavirus release [88]. how these ligases contribute to mammarenavirus release, including whether ubiquitination is involved and, if so, what the targets of ubiquitination pertinent to virus release are, remain unknown. ubiquitination could be used by PPXY-containing viral budding proteins in a manner equivalent to that used in trafficking of integral plasma membrane receptor proteins through only one lysine in Z is highly conserved among the Old World mammarenaviruses, K69 in LCMV Z, but it does not appear to be ubiquitinated in LCMV. results show that direct ubiquitination of PPXY-containing viral proteins may not alone be sufficient for ESCRT recruitment, a finding supported by other studies. in HTLV-1, mutation of the lone ubiquitin acceptor site in the MA protein significantly reduced release of infectious particles. however, the defect was not as severe as that of the PPXY-mutant. overexpression of Nedd4 family ubiquitin ligases can enhance budding of PPXY-containing viruses. it is yet unclear whether ARRDC1 contributes to ESCRT recruitment by other PPXY-containing viruses. annexin A6 (ANXA6) and thrombospondin 1 (THBS1) were found in LCMV and LASV VLPs. these proteins have both a PPXY domain and a YPX(1,3)L domain. other proteins may function in concert with Nedd4 family ubiquitin ligases. there are well over 1,000 cellular proteins that contain PPXY domains. the regulation of interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) by Nedd4 represents such an example whereby Nedd4 induces degradation of IFITM3 through ubiquitination. study advances understanding of mammarenaviruses by showing that Nedd4 family ubiquitin ligases are required for the efficient release of LCMV DI particles. this suggests that other viral and/or host proteins may serve as important targets of ubiquitination to link Z to the ESCRT pathway. this finding indicates that there is no clear, single mechanism at work to explain how Nedd4 family ubiquitin ligases contribute to the budding process of PPXY- becco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (11965\u2013092) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (16140\u2013071), 1% penicillin-streptomycin (15140\u2013122), 1% MEM Non-Essential Amino Acids Solution (11140\u2013050), 1% HEPES Buffer Solution (15630\u2013130) and 1% Gluta-MAX (35050\u2013061) cells were grown in a humidified incubator at 37\u00b0 LCMV Pol I L segment plasmids containing the KK10/77RR, NoK and PPPY/AAAA mutations in the Z protein were synthesized using the WT plasmid as a template for cloning. the mutant versions noK, PPPY/AAAA, K5R, K10R, K33R, K38R, K69R and K77R were made by Biobasic, Inc.

HEK293T cells were seeded at 5x105 cells per well in 6-well plates. cells were seeded 24 hours after seeding with 2 g of different LCMV Z plasmids, 2 g of HA-Ub plasmids, and 4 g of 1 mg/mL polyethylenimine (PEI) x105 cells per well in 6-well plates were treated with 100 g/mL aqueous solution of poly D-lysine Hydrobromide (P6407; Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) 24 hours after seeding, 1.5 L each of 10 M siRNA targeting Nedd4, ITCH and WWP1 or 4.5 L of a non-targeting control siRNA were added to a final volume of 500 L of Opti-MEM. affinity purified using magnetic streptavidin beads (65601, Thermo Fisher Scientific) urea powder (U5378, Sigma Aldrich) was added to the cell lysates to a final concentration of 8 M. the concentration of urea was decreased by diluting the solution with 1x Triton lysis buffer. titers were determined via plaque assay and each titer value was first normalized to the sum of all titer values for a given independent experiment. all values were then multiplied by 100 to obtain the titer values as a percent of the control. for compound #4 and compound #5 challenges, 2.5x105 HEK293T cells were seeded in 6-well plates then the next day were infected with non-recombinant LCMV at a plates were incubated for 60\u201390 minutes at 37\u00b0C then each well was overlaid with a 0.7% agarose (20\u2013102, Apex Industrial Chemicals, Aberdeen, United Kingdom) after five days, plates were fixed with formaldehyde. monolayers stained with 0.1% crystal violet (C581-100, Fisher Scientific) and 2.1% ethanol in water. the membranes were stained with a solution containing 0.1% Ponceau S (P3504, Sigma-Aldrich) and 5% acetic acid. the antibodies were diluted in iBind Flex fluorescent detection solution (SLF2019, Thermo Fisher Scientific) or in iBind Flex solution (SLF2020, Thermo Fisher Scientific) rabbit anti-Nedd4 (2740, Cell Signaling), (1:1,000), rabbit anti-VPS4A/B (SAB 420025, Sigma-Aldrich) (1:1,000), rabbit anti-IMPDH2 (ab 131158, Abcam) (1:1,000), rabbit anti-LCMV nucleoprotein (2165) (1:5,000), mouse anti-JUNV nucleoprotein clone NA05-AG12 (NR-2582; BEI Resources) (1: cDNA was generated for the LCMV S-segment using primer S 2865 (5\u2019-CAGGGTGCAAGTGGTGTGGTAAGA-3\u2019) and for the L-segment using primer L 5906- (5\u2019-TGGGACTGAGTTTCGAGCATTACG-3\u2019) multiscribe reverse transcriptase (4308228, Applied Biosystems) was used in a 50 L reaction to generate cDNA. cDNA was generated using 5 L of purified viral RNA, 1 L of primers L 7219- (5\u2019-GCACCGAGGATCCTAGGCTTTTTGATGCGCAA-3\u2019) at 2 M, 1 L of 10 mM dNTPs, 6 L nuclease-free water, 1 L of Superscript III (18080\u2013044, Thermo Fisher Scientific), 4 L of 5x first strand buffer and 1 L of 0.1 M dithioth two 6-well plates per condition were seeded with 5x105 HEK293T cells per well. each well was transfected with 2 g of an empty vector or plasmid expressing SBP-tagged LCMV or LASV Z. the next day each well was transfected with 2 g of an empty vector or plasmid expressing SBP-tagged LCMV or LASV Z. cell culture media containing VLPs was cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation. cells and VLPs were lysed with triton lysis buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail and PhosphoStop phosphatase inhibitor cocktail. each lane was cut into 16 slices. each lane was cut into 16 slices. peptides with XCorr scores of less than 2.0 were excluded from the dataset. proteins that were identified both in a Z condition and the empty vector control were eliminated unless there were five times more total peptides in the Z condition as in the empty vector. 1x105 HEK293T cells, siRNA at a 10 nM final concentration, and 1.2 L of RNAiMax were combined in antibiotic-free HEK293T growth media in a final volume of 1.2 mL per well. 48 hours after reverse transfection, cells were transfected with Z plasmids and PEI as above. the DAVID gene functional classification tool was used to identify proteins that were enriched in the Z interactome. the tool was used to search for P(S/T)AP, YPX(1,3)L and PPXY motifs in human proteins (taxon 9606). cellular proteins identified in cells released from LCMV or LASV virions were analyzed using the NIH DAVID gene functional classification tool.
