{"summary": "rSV, RV, hMPV and co-infections caused acute bronchiolitis in infants. the severity was assessed by recording SaO2% at admission, a daily clinical score, the duration of oxygen supplementation and the length of hospitalization. RV compared with RSV and dual RSV/RV infection caused a significant less severe disease with a lower clinical score. acute bronchiolitis is the most common respiratory disease in infants under 2 years. up to 90% of this acute wheezing disease has been attributed to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) a prospective study was conducted in infants hospitalized for a first episode of acute bronchiolitis during the epidemic season. a prospective multicentre study was conducted in infants hospitalized for a first episode of acute bronchiolitis during three epidemic seasons. the diagnosis was based on dyspnea and wheezing or crackles associated with lung hyperinflation. atopy was defined by asthma, allergic rhinitis or eczema in first degree relatives, or by eczema in infants. the severity of the disease was assessed with SaO2%, a clinical score, the duration of oxygen requirement, and the length of hospitalization. the highest score observed during the hospitalization was retained for determining the severity of the disease. X-ray No Yes with CTR0.5 Score II = final score = scores I+II E = expiratory; I = inspiratory; CTR = cardiothoracic ratio. antigens for RSV, influenza virus A and B, parainfluenza type 1, 2, and 3, and adenovirus were detected by direct immunofluorescence assay (DFA) from nasopharyngeal aspiration (NPA) samples. multivariate analyses were performed by using stepwise logistic regression to select variables independently associated with the virus-related severity. p0.05 was considered statistically significant. the severity of the disease was assessed with SaO2%, a clinical score, the duration of oxygen requirement, and the length of hospitalization. each item was scaled from 0 to 1 and the score varied from 0 to 18. a prospective multicentre study was conducted in infants hospitalized for a first episode of acute bronchiolitis during three epidemic seasons. the diagnosis was based on dyspnea and wheezing or crackles associated with lung hyperinflation on chest X-ray. the length of the hospitalization was calculated as the time between the admission and the validation of the discharge criteria. no alteration in feeding during the past 24 h nor other complications directly related to the bronchiolitis. multiplex PCR targeted 14 respiratory viruses: RSV, influenza viruses A, B and C, hMPV, parainfluenza viruses (PIV) types 1, 2, 3, 4, RV, enterovirus (EV), human coronavirus OC43, 229E and NL63. Statistical analysis Pairwise correlation among the SaO2%, clinical score, length of oxygen supply, demographic data and hospitalization were assessed using Spearman's rank test. with a clinical score >7, 96 (46.9%) required oxygen supplementation, seven were transferred to PICU and four were intubated.
