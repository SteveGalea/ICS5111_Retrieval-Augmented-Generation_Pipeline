{"summary": "negative-strand RNA viruses replicate their viral genome via the synthesis of full length positive-strand complementary RNA molecules. negative-strand RNA viruses also serve as templates for the synthesis of negative-strand virion RNA (vRNA) genomes. the negative-strand genomes also serve as templates for the production of mRNAs. the IAV vRNA and cRNA segments form ribonucleoprotein (NP) complexes by association to the polymerase and to multiple copies of the nucleoprotein (NP) different models have been proposed for regulation of transcription and replication. several reporter assays have been described to study and quantify IAV transcription/replication in vivo. these reporter systems consist of a reporter protein-encoding cDNA, flanked by 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 UTRs, inserted in an antisense orientation between a polI promoter and a transcription terminator or ribozyme sequence. these assays are very helpful to quantify virus replication or virus production, and to assess antiviral activity of compounds including antibodies. the firefly and Gaussia luciferase genes flanked by 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 UTRs of the NP segment. they are inserted in an antisense orientation between a polI promoter and a ribozyme sequence. cells are transfected with either one or both reporter constructs (single or co-transfection) luciferase expression is induced by expression of viral RNA polymerases (PB1, PB2, PA) and NP either by simultaneous co-transfection of expression plasmids (transfection assay) the firefly and Gaussia luciferase expression levels can be measured consecutively using a dual luciferase assay system (Promega) 24 h post-transfection. similar results were obtained at earlier and later time points post transfection. this indicates that expression of the firefly luciferase gene is strongly in favor of Gaussia luciferase, when both reporter constructs are present within the same cell. thus, the results indicate that expression of the firefly luciferase gene is negatively affected by co-transfection of the Gaussia luciferase reporter plasmid. reporter gene constructs FNP and GNP were transfected singly or in combination. significant differences in A\u2013D are indicated. similar results were obtained when an empty plasmid was included in transfection mixture. lowering the amount of co-transfected Gaussia and increasing the amount of co-transfected firefly luciferase reporter plasmid shifted the balance in the competition between the firefly and Gaussia luciferase genome segments. this increased ratio resulted from altered firefly rather than Gaussia luciferase expression levels. increased amount of polymerase subunit-encoding plasmids, but not of the NP-encoding plasmid, appeared to alleviate the competition between the two segments. however, it also negatively affected the reporter gene expression levels per se. extended Gaussia luciferase gene construct was inserted behind the stop codon. it produced a genome segment with exactly the same length as the firefly luciferase genome segment. the absolute Gaussia luciferase expression level from the GFsNP segment was lower than that from the GNP segment. firefly to Gaussia luciferase activity (Fluc/Gluc) after single or co-transfection of FNP and different versions of the extended Gaussia reporter construct carrying UTRs derived from the eight IAV-WSN genome segments. the genome segment UTRs provide signals for viral RNA transcription and replication, as well as for packaging of vRNP into virus particles. PB1, NA or NS segment UTRs resulted in balanced firefly and Gaussia luciferase expression levels. similar ratio's were observed when expressed alone or in combination. 80% of variance in firefly luciferase inhibition correlate with variability in Gaussia luciferase expression levels.

UCGUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU reporter constructs were co-transfected with plasmids encoding each of the IAV genome segments. the different IAV segments significantly affected the firefly luciferase levels. expression of Gaussia luciferase was hardly affected by the presence of the viral RNA segments. the lack of inhibition of Gaussia luciferase expression correlates with the very efficient replication/transcription of this reporter segment. we speculate that the lack of inhibition of Gaussia luciferase expression correlates with the very efficient replication/transcription of this reporter segment. normFluc/Gluc was decreased when compared to wild type NP UTRs. similar level of competition was not observed when mutations that increase the number of base-pairs were introduced in the 5\u2032 UTR of the NP segment. either NP, NPph or NPphR UTRs (GFsNP, GFsNPph, and GFsNPphR, respectively) normalized ratio of firefly to Gaussia luciferase activity (Fluc/Gluc) after single or co-transfection of firefly luciferase constructs with NP or NPphs UTR (FNP and FNPph, respectively) and the short or extended Gaussi reporter constructs containing the NPph UTRs showed slightly higher luciferase levels. however, when using the infection assay, dramatic differences in reporter gene expression levels were observed. this fold difference was much increased (130 to 160 fold) in the infection assay. RT-PCR analysis of mRNA levels derived from the transfection (trans) or infection (inf) assay. cells transfected with expression plasmids encoding PB1, PB2, PA and NP were infected with IAV-WSN. the shortest segments, M and NS, give the strongest inhibition of the reporter gene expression. the coding region of the vRNA segment may also be of importance. the extended version of the Gaussia reporter segment was still able to outcompete its firefly luciferase counterpart. recombinant viruses carrying two nucleotide changes (G3A/C8U) showed enhanced replication/transcription of the mutated segments in detriment of the wild-type UTR-bearing segments. the most likely scenario suggested by our observations is that replication/transcription of one reporter segment interferes with that of another by sequestering UTR-binding proteins. IAV RNA segments compete with each other for available polymerases. competition is expected to be most apparent early during infection, when only low amounts of polymerase are present. hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozyme \u2013 AloI restriction site \u2013 firefly or Gaussia luciferase gene \u2013 BaeI restriction site \u2013 human PolI promoter. these constructs did not yet contain IAV 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTR sequences. primer dimers corresponding to 5\u2032 UTR sequences were ligated into the resulting plasmid. transfection and infection HEK 293T cells were seeded in 96-wells plates. cells were transfected with reporter plasmids encoding firefly or Gaussia luciferase. next day, cells were infected with IAV-WSN at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 TCID50 units per cells. ratio of firefly luciferase/Gaussia luciferase activity after co-transfection of both reporter constructs was normalized to the ratio of firefly luciferase/Gaussia luciferase activity after single transfection of both reporter constructs. the ratio of firefly luciferase/Gaussia luciferase activity after single transfection of both reporter constructs was set at 1. strand buffer, 2 l of 0.1 M DTT, 1 l of RNase Inhibitor (40 U/l) were added and the mixture was incubated at 42\u00b0C for 2 min. qPCR forward and reverse primers that primed at the coding sequence of corresponding reporter gene were used to amplify cDNA. all experiments were performed 2\u20134 times, with each experiment containing 4 replicates. differences between means were determined using Student's t-test. primer dimers corresponding to 5\u2032 UTR sequences were ligated into the resulting plasmid. the corresponding polI transcripts are similar to genuine vRNA segments. the length of the extended Gaussia luciferase vRNA is identical to the corresponding firefly luciferase-encoding vRNA. pPOLI-PB1, pPOLI-PA, pPOLI-HA, pPOLI-NP, pPOLI-NA, and pPOLI-NS were a kind gift of Dr. Ervin Fodor [37] for the transfection assay, cells were transfected with reporter plasmids encoding firefly or Gaussia luciferase. the next day, cells were infected with IAV-WSN at a multipli ly luciferase/Gaussia luciferase activity after single transfection of reporter constructs was set at 1.
