{"summary": "clinical microbiology is a science of interpretive judgment that is becoming more complex, not less. prokaryotic microorganisms, while genetically less complex than multicellular eukaryotes, are uniquely suited to adapt to environments where antibiotics and host responses apply pressures that encourage their survival. attention to preanalytical specimen management in microbiology is critical to accuracy. flocked swabs are effective Anaerobic swab transport device, RT, 2 h Fungus culture. flocked swabs are recommended Virus swab transport device, RT, 2 h Suspected agent of bioterrorism Refer to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website. the microbiology laboratory needs a specimen that has been appropriately selected, collected, and transported to the laboratory for analysis. the diagnosis of infectious disease is best achieved by applying in-depth knowledge of both medical and laboratory science along with principles of epidemiology and pharmacokinetics of antibiotics and by integrating strategic view of host-parasite interactions. a swab is not the specimen of choice for many specimens because swabs pick up extraneous microbes, hold extremely small volumes of the specimen (0.05 mL), make it difficult to get bacteria or fungi away from the swab fibers and onto media. a swab is not the specimen of choice for many specimens because swabs pick up extraneous microbes and hold extremely small volumes of the specimen. flocked nature of the swab allows for more efficient release of contents for evaluation. the laboratory must follow its procedure manual or face legal challenges. a specimen should be collected prior to administration of antibiotics. in most sections, there are targeted recommendations and precautions regarding selecting and collecting specimens for analysis for a disease process. the test methods in the tables are listed in priority order according to the recommendations of the authors and reviewers. when room temperature is specified for a certain time period, it is expected that the sample should be refrigerated after that time unless specified otherwise. flocked swabs are effective Anaerobic swab transport device, RT, 2 h Virus culture Tissue, fluid, aspirate, biopsy, etc. flocked swabs are recommended Virus swab transport device, RT, 2 h Virus culture Tissue, fluid, aspirate, biopsy, etc. cdc.gov/documents/PPTResponse/table2specimenselection.pdf Serology 5 mL serum Clot tube, RT, 2 h Antigen test As described in the laboratory specimen collection manual Closed container, RT, 2 h NAAT 5 mL plasma EDTA tube, RT, 2 h Other specimen Closed container, RT, 2 h Abbreviations: AFB, acid-fast bacillus; NAAT, a certified microbiology specialist is one of the most valuable laboratory partners in infectious disease diagnosis. the impact of proper specimen management on patient care is enormous. there are strategic tenets of specimen management and testing in microbiology. swabs are expected from nasopharyngeal and viral respiratory infections. the flocked nature of the swab allows for more efficient release of contents for evaluation. the laboratory must follow its procedure manual or face legal challenges. the microbiology laboratory policy manual should be available at all times for all medical staff to review or consult. it would be particularly helpful to encourage the nursing staff to review the specimen collection and management portion of the manual. this can facilitate collaboration between the laboratory, with the microbiology expertise, and the specimen collection personnel. the diagnosis of bloodstream infections (BSIs) is one of the most critical functions of clinical microbiology laboratories. conventional blood culture methods provide results within 48 hours. some microorganisms, such as mycobacteria and dimorphic fungi, require longer incubation periods; others require special culture media or non-culture-based methods. Streptococcus spp, Enterococcus spp 2\u20134 blood culture sets per septic episode Listeria monocytogenes Enterobacteriaceae Pseudomonas spp Acinetobacter spp Infants and children: blood volume depends on the child's weight. 20\u201330 mL of blood per culture in adults injected into at least 2 blood culture bottles should be transported to the laboratory ASAP for early incubation. fungih 2 or more lysis-centrifugation (Isolator) blood culture vials 10 mL should be inoculated directly into each lysis-centrifugation culture vial. gregatibacter aphrophilus, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Aggregatibacter (formerly Actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens, and Kingella kingae. e Legionella bacteremia occurs infrequently and rarely is the organism recovered from blood even when optimum culture techniques are employed. the volume of blood obtained for each blood culture request is the most important variable in recovering bacteria and fungi from patients with bloodstream infections. for adults, 20\u201330 mL of blood per culture set is recommended and may require more than 2 bottles depending on the system. a second important determinant is the number of blood culture sets performed during a given septic episode. iodine tincture, chlorine peroxide, and chlorhexidine gluconate are superior to povidone-iodine preparations as skin disinfectants for blood culture. iodine tincture and CHG require about 30 seconds to exert an antiseptic effect compared with 1.5\u20132 minutes for povidone-iodine preparations. a blood culture becomes positive because these specimens often represent life-threatening infections. if the physician wishes not to be notified during specific times, arrangements must be made by the physician for a delegated healthcare professional to receive the call. standard blood cultures (BCs) obtained at the same time, one from the catheter or port and one from peripheral venipuncture. if both BCs grow the same organism and the BC drawn from the device becomes positive more than 2 hours before the BC drawn by venipuncture, there is a high probability of catheter-associated BSI [12] infected (mycotic) aneurysms and vascular grafts may result in positive blood cultures. definitive diagnosis requires microscopic visualization and/or culture recovery of etiologic agents from representative biopsy or graft material. a microbiologic diagnosis of less common etiologic agents is never made. there are no firm diagnostic guidelines that can be given. some of the more common and clinically important pathogens are listed in Table I-3 below. pericardial fluid or pericardium biopsy Place in formalin and transport to histopathology laboratory for processing.

INFECTIONS Clinical microbiology tests of value in establishing an etiologic diagnosis of infections within the central nervous system are outlined below. a minimum of 0.5\u20131 mL of CSF should be sent to the microbiology laboratory in a sterile container. CSF Gram stains should be prepared after cytocentrifugation and positive results reported immediately to the caregiver. identification and susceptibility testing of bacteria recovered from cultures is routinely performed unless contamination during collection or processing is suspected. most clinical microbiology laboratories do not perform all of the testing listed in the tables. eptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis are associated with specific bacterial pathogens. age and other factors (ie, immune status, post neurosurgery, trauma) are associated with specific bacterial pathogens.

Sensitivities of NAATs ranging from 50% to 80% have been reported in patients with T. gondii retinitis. cytomegalovirus retinitis has become much less frequent since the advent of highly active antiretroviral treatment. patients with detectable CMV viral loads have a higher likelihood of retinal disease progression and those with high CMV viral loads have increased mortality. VDRL testing of cerebrospinal fluid is recommended in clinical settings where syphilitic uveitis is suspected. clinicians must clearly mark specimens as to which eye has been sampled. the most

specimens thought to harbor Herpes B virus requires use of biosafety level 4 precautions in the laboratory. specimen types include swabs of ulcers, corneal scrapings, biopsies, or anterior chamber or vitreous aspirates. the laboratory and ophthalmologist may agree to inoculate these specimens onto media and prepare smears at the bedside. periorbital cellulitis is almost always a complication of sinusitis. organisms associated with it include Streptococcus pneumoniae, nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Moraxella spp, anaerobic bacteria, aspergillus spp, and the zygomycetes. trachoma, a form of conjunctivitis due to specific strains of Chlamydia trachomatis, is a leading cause of blindness, especially in children. trachoma, a form of conjunctivitis due to

sample in sterile saline. most common corneal infections occur in patients who improperly use their contact lens system. environmental gram-negative rods include P. aeruginosa, Nocardia spp, moulds including dematiceous fungi, and environmental mycobacteria. endophthalmitis can arise either by exogenous introduction of pathogens into the eye following trauma or surgery, or as result of endogenous introduction of pathogens across the blood-eye barrier. infection due to agents such as the herpes viruses, Toxoplasma gondii, Toxocara spp, Echinococcus spp, and Onchocerca volvulus do

infrequently is it due to infection that is almost always caused by endogenous microbes accessing the eye via a breach in the blood-eye barrier. diagnosis of etiology of systemic infections should be coupled with a careful ocular examination performed preferably by an ophthalmologist with specific infectious disease expertise. a total of 50% to 80% have been reported in patients with T. gondii retinitis. the diagnostic value of NAAT in these studies is not yet clear. cases do occur in HIV patients who have either failed HIV therapy or as an AIDS-presenting diagnosis. odontogenic infections are usually caused by endogenous periodontal or gingival flora. these infections include peritonsillar and pharyngeal abscesses, deep space abscesses, and cervical lymphadenitis. odontogenic infections can occur by hematogenous spread or by direct extension. infections caused by oropharyngeal flora include epiglottitis, mastoiditis, inflammation of salivary tissue, and suppurative parotitis. there is a chance of sudden occlusion of the trachea if the epiglottis is disturbed. if swabbing is attempted, it should be in a setting with appropriate emergency response. gram-negative bacilli and staphylococci are most frequently associated with these conditions. a swab is not the specimen of choice for these specimens. use anaerobic transport containers if anaerobes are suspected.

Streptococcus pyogenes (group A -hemolytic Streptococcus) is the most common bacterial cause of pharyngitis. it carries with it potentially serious sequelae, primarily in children. species have been reported in pharyngeal swab specimens. this should be done only in settings in which these organisms are considered to be of significance, such as outbreaks of epidemiologically associated cases of pharyngitis. acute otitis media with effusion (AOME) is the clinical variant of otitis media most likely to have a bacterial etiology and as a result, most likely to benefit from antimicrobial therapy (Table V-1). Streptococcus pneumoniae, nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis are also thought to cause AOME. cultures of the pharynx, nasopharynx, anterior nares, or of nasal drainage material are of no value in trying to establish an etiologic diagnosis of bacterial AOME. a Viruses are often the etiologic agent, but microbiologic studies do not help with treatment decisions. the role of fungi as etiological agents is more controversial, possibly due to numerous publications that used poor sample collection methods. in immunocompetent hosts, fungi are associated most often with chronic sinusitis. immediatelyc Streptococcus pyogenes Pseudomonas aeruginosa Enterobacteriaceae Mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora from the oral cavity Fungal Aspergillus spp. a Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes do cause acute maxillary sinusitis but only infrequently [75] an endoscopic sinus aspirate is recommended to establish a fungal etiology. pharyngitis accounts for an estimated 40 million visits by adults to medical facilities annually in the united states. the condition occurs even more often in children. a selective medium is available Pharyngeal swab Anaerobic swab transport, RT, 2 h Viral Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) Monospot teste 5 mL serum Clot tube, RT, 2 h EBV serology Herpes Simplex virus (HSV) there are numerous commercially available direct antigen tests. a second throat swab should be examined by a more sensitive direct NAAT or by culture as a means of arbitrating possible false negative direct antigen test results. if the direct antigen test is negative, the second swab will be discarded if the direct antigen test is positive. the swab transport device should be compatible with the NAAT. if the Monospot test is positive, it may be considered diagnostic for EBV infection. up to 10% of monospot tests are falsely negative. a definitive diagnosis can be achieved with EBV-specific serologic testing. rapid antigen tests for S. pyogenes, in particular, have been used extensively in the evaluation of patients with pharyngitis. such tests are technically nondemanding, generally reliable and often performed at the point of care. arcanobacterium haemolyticum also causes pharyngitis but less commonly. it occurs most often in teenagers and young adults. it occurs most often in teenagers and young adults. NFECTIONS Respiratory tract infections are among the most common infectious diseases. the list of causative agents continues to expand as new pathogens and syndromes are recognized. this section describes the major etiologic agents and the microbiologic approaches to the diagnosis of bronchitis and bronchiolitis. Bordetella pertussis should be considered in an adolescent or young adult with prominent cough. there is one FDA cleared platform for B. pertussis detection.

Gram-negative bacteria (mostly Staphylococcus spp) account for >60% of cultured microorganisms. the location, size, and number of liver abscesses is often not helpful for differentiation purposes. the majority are in the right lobe and can be seen in single or multiple loci. serology or serum antigen detection tests can be helpful to exclude amebic abscess. ital infections due to N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis can have extension of the disease to involve the liver capsule or adjacent peritoneum (Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome) the same organisms recovered from cases of pyogenic liver abscess (primarily cholecystitis and cholangitis) unusual causes of splenic abscess include Bartonella spp, Streptobacillus moniliformis, Nocardia spp, and Burkholderia pseudomallei. the spectrum of organisms to be considered needs to be expanded to include mycobacterium spp, fungi, and parasites for immunocompromised patients. osteomyelitis may arise as a consequence of hematogenous seeding of bone from a distant site, extension into bone from a contiguous soft tissue infection, or direct traumatic inoculation. joint infections may develop by any of these routes, but occur most often by hematogenous seeding. osteomyelitis Establishing an etiologic diagnosis of osteomyelitis nearly always requires obtaining bone biopsy material for microbiologic evaluation [135] sonication or bead mill homogenizing samples from the removed prosthesis should be used.

'post-treatment' Lyme disease syndrome may occur after appropriate antibiotic therapy for laboratory documented B. burgdorferi infection. persistent symptoms lasting more than six months such as fatigue, musculoskeletal pains, and neurocognitive dysfunction do not permanently respond to long-term antibiotic therapy based on randomized-controlled trial data. tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), human herpes virus-6 (HHV-6), parvovirus (erythrovirus) B19, measles, mumps, rubella, BK virus, JC virus, dengue, hepatitis A virus, hepatit if the pretest probability of acute infection is low to moderate, it is good practice to measure IgG antibodies at disease presentation and two to three weeks later. if the pretest probability of acute infection is low to moderate, it is good practice to measure IgG (or total \u2013IgG plus IgM) antibodies at disease presentation and two to three weeks later. HIV-1 is an RNA virus with a genome consisting of three major genes encoding capsid proteins (gag \u2013 p55, p24, p17); reverse transcriptase, protease, and integrase (pol \u2013 p66, p51, p31); and envelope glycoproteins (env \u2013 pg160, gp120, gp41). false positive results are generally of low copy number (5000 copies/mL); therefore, low copy number results should prompt retesting of a second specimen. if NAAT is used to make a diagnosis of acute HIV-1 infection, it may be helpful to document subsequent HIV-1 seroconversion by conventional serologic testing.

Combined HIV antibody plus p24 assays are in widespread use as initial screening assays. if the Western blot result is positive, the patient is considered to be infected with HIV-1. testing for HIV-2 antibodies is recommended to rule out the possibility of HIV-2 infection causing the reactive combined HIV-1/-2 antibody result. Western blot assay is less sensitive than third or fourth generation EIAs during seroconversion. as many as a third of healthy HIV-uninfected blood donors have indeterminate HIV-1 Western blot assays. resistance testing is recommended for patients with acute or chronic HIV infection prior to initiating therapy. 5%\u201310% of patients who have been infected with EBV fail to develop antibodies to the EBNA antigen. 5%\u201310% of patients who have been infected with EBV fail to develop antibodies to the EBNA antigen. increased EBV viral load detected by NAAT in peripheral blood may be present in patients before the development of EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disease.

Detection of antibody in cerebrospinal fluid may indicate central nervous system infection, blood contamination, or transfer of antibodies across the blood-brain barrier. a positive VZV IgG with a negative VZV IgM result indicates previous exposure to VZV and/or response to vaccination. VZV NAATs can be performed on CSF as an aid to the diagnosis of VZV central nervous system infection. the presence of IgG antibodies specific to the glycoprotein G antigen from HSV type 1 or 2 indicates previous exposure to the corresponding serotype. a viral culture transport swab is vigorously rubbed over the base of the suspect skin or mucosal lesion. the vesicle may be unroofed to expose the base. older, dried and scabbed lesions are less likely to yield positive results. the most commonly used molecular test for the laboratory diagnosis of HHV-6 is NAAT (none FDA-cleared), some formats of which differentiate variants A and B. commercial assays do not typically distinguish between variants A and B. testing for parvovirus (erythrovirus) B19-specific antibodies is recommended as first line laboratory diagnostic method for parvovirus B19 infection. the presence of IgM antibodies alone is indicative of past exposure and suggests immunity. NAAT is the most sensitive noninvasive technique for the laboratory diagnosis of parvovirus B19-related anemia in solid organ transplant recipients. the presence of giant pronormoblasts in bone marrow is suggestive of parvovirus B19 infection, although such cells are not always detected. IgM is detectable for a month or longer after rash onset. a serologic diagnosis of acute measles requires demonstration of a four-fold rise in IgG antibody titer. two serum specimens are collected, with the first being obtained as soon as possible after rash onset. measles-specific antibodies in CSF are used in the diagnosis of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. levels of rubeola antibody are highly elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid of SSPE patients compared to those without the disease. NAAT also can be considered as a diagnostic test option [232] waba Viral transport medium, RT, 2 h Oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swabb Viral transport medium, RT, 2 h Cerebrospinal fluid Sterile tube, RT, 2 h Abbreviations: NAAT, nucleic acid amplification test; RT, room temperature. b Place the swab in viral transport medium, cell culture medium or other sterile isotonic solution ( the presence of antibodies to rubella virus in a single serum specimen is evidence of immunity. acute rubella infection can be confirmed by a four-fold rise in rubella IgG antibody titer between acute and convalescent serum specimens or by the presence of serum rubella IgM. quantitative NAAT may be used as a screening test, followed by BK viral load testing by NAAT, if positive. if used as a screening test, only high levels (ie, above a laboratory established threshold that correlate with disease) should be considered significant. Detection of JC virus DNA by NAAT in CSF specimens of patients with suspected progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy has replaced the need for tissue biopsy for laboratory diagnosis. dengue diagnosis requires laboratory confirmation by culture, NAAT or testing for dengue specific antibodies. the presence of hepatitis A-specific IgM antibodies indicates either past hepatitis A infection or immunity to this viral infection from vaccination. there is no commercially available laboratory test for detecting only hepatitis A-specific IgG antibodies (ie, IgM and IgG combined) tests for hepatitis B and D disease detection are primarily serologic and molecular. check with the laboratory about minimum volumes of blood needed. the presence of hepatitis B surface antibodies indicates recovery from and immunity to hepatitis B infection. hepatitis B core total antibodies appear at the onset of symptoms of acute hepatitis B infection and persist for life. presence indicates acute (mainly virus-specific IgM antibodies), recent (both hepatitis B core-specific IgM and IgG antibodies) or previous (hepatitis B core-specific IgG antibodies) lecular laboratory tests used in diagnosis and management of hepatitis B infection have been reviewed. hepatitis B surface antibodies in absence of hepatitis B core total antibodies distinguishes vaccine-mediated immunity from immunity acquired by natural infection. current commercially available assays for detecting hepatitis B surface antibody yield positive results (qualitative) for antibody levels of 10 mIU/mL in serum or plasma. signal-to-cut-off ratios are an alternative to supplemental testing. NAAT can be performed qualitatively (by reverse-transcription PCR or transcription-mediated amplification) or quantitatively (by reverse-transcription PCR or branched DNA) quantification of HCV RNA is necessary to monitor rapid and early virologic response to antiviral therapy. positive RIBA results are indicative of chronic or resolved HCV infection. those with a single band detected are considered indeterminate. hepatitis C virus genotyping is used to guide the choice and duration of antiviral therapy. commercial FDA-cleared product is available for rapid PCR testing for enteroviruses in CSF. 1A commercial FDA-cleared product is available for rapid PCR testing for enteroviruses in CSF. Nasopharyngeal aspirate/washing, throat or nasopharyngeal swab, lower respiratory specimen Sterile container or viral transport medium, RT, 2 h Culture Nasopharyngeal aspirate/washing, throat or nasopharyngeal swab, lower respiratory specimen Sterile container or viral transport medium, RT,2 h Antigen detection. NAAT is now considered the gold standard for detection of influenza virus in clinical samples. commercial products are available for rapid NAAT testing for respiratory viruses Serologic evaluation involves assessment of acute and convalescent titers. west Nile virus IgM antibodies may persist in serum for 6 months. false positive results may occur following recent yellow fever immunization or natural infection with other flaviviruses. positive antibody titers to west Nile virus are commonly present in older individuals, especially those from the Indian subcontinent. west Nile Virus NAAT testing is insensitive for central nervous system disease. equine, saint Louis and California encephalitis virus infection may be diagnosed serologically following the same strategy used for west Nile virus. serologic diagnosis relies on demonstration of antibodies to group-specific antigens. detecting antibodies in CSF may indicate central nervous system infection, blood contamination, or transfer of antibodies across the blood-brain barrier. Optimal Transport Time NAAT Saliva Sterile tube, RT, 2 h Direct fluorescent antibody Nuchal skin biopsy, brain Sterile container, RT, 2 h Serology Serum Clot tube, RT, 2 h Abbreviations: IgG, immunoglobulin. serologic testing may be used to document post-vaccination seroconversion in the immunocompromised, if there is significant deviation from a prophylaxis schedule. HIV-1 is an RNA virus with a genome consisting of three major genes encoding capsid proteins (gag \u2013 p55, p24, p17); reverse transcriptase, protease, and integrase (pol \u2013 p66, p51, p31); and envelope glycoproteins (env \u2013 pg160, gp120, gp41). false positive results are generally of low copy number (5000 copies/mL); therefore, low copy number results should prompt retesting of a second specimen. testing another specimen two to four weeks later should be considered if initial antibody, antigen or RNA tests are negative. plasmaa EDTA, RT, 2 h HIV-2 RNA and proviral DNA should be collected in a lavender top (EDTA) tube. the specimen should be collected in a lavender top (EDTA) tube. third generation assays allowed detection of HIV IgM (in addition to IgG) third generation assays are generally positive seven to 14 and four to seven days, respectively, after detectable virus by NAAT. if the Western blot result is positive, the patient is considered to be infected with HIV-1. testing for HIV-2 antibodies is recommended to rule out the possibility of HIV-2 infection causing the reactive combined HIV-1/-2 antibody result. Western blot assay is less sensitive than third or fourth generation EIAs during seroconversion. as many as a third of healthy HIV-uninfected blood donors have indeterminate HIV-1 Western blot assays. resistance testing is recommended for patients with acute or chronic HIV infection prior to initiating therapy. the presence of VCA IgM antibodies indicates recent primary infection with EBV. the presence of EBNA antibodies indicates infection more than 6 weeks from the time of the sample. the presence of EBNA antibodies indicates infection more than 6 weeks from the time of the sample. increased EBV viral load detected by NAAT in peripheral blood may be present in patients before the development of EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disease. Tissue from patients with EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disease may show monoclonal, oligoclonal, or polyclonal lesions. standard reference material (SRM 2366) is available from the national Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for CMV viral load measurement. a bacterial artificial chromosome contains the genome of the Towne strain of CMV. a variety of assays can be used to assess antiviral resistance. most commonly sequencing of UL97 (phosphotransferase gene) with or without UL54 (DNA polymerase gene) is used in such situations. if mutations are selected by ganciclovir, there is typically cross-resistance to both ganciclovir and cidofovir but not foscarnet. Detection of antibody in cerebrospinal fluid may indicate central nervous system infection, blood contamination, or transfer of antibodies across the blood-brain barrier. a positive VZV IgG with a negative VZV IgM result indicates previous exposure to VZV. laboratory testing for smallpox is available at http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/lab-testing. a fourfold increase in IgG results may also suggest recent exposure. NAAT is the most sensitive, specific and rapid test for diagnosis of HSV-associated skin or mucosal lesions. a viral culture transport swab is vigorously rubbed over the base of the suspect skin or mucosal lesion. the vesicle may be unroofed to expose the base. human herpes virus-6 causes roseola infantum in children and can cause primary or reactivation infection in immunocompromised patients. commercial assays do not typically distinguish between variants A and B. a single HHV-6 test result may not be clinically relevant. HHV-6 antigens can be demonstrated by immunohistochemical or in situ hybridization tests in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. the presence of IgM class antibodies suggests recent infection. a caveat regarding NAAT for diagnosis of parvovirus B19-related anemia is that parvovirus B19 DNA has been anecdotally detected for extended periods in serum. the presence of giant pronormoblasts in bone marrow is suggestive of parvovirus B19 infection. a second serum specimen, collected 72 hours after rash onset, should be tested for IgM. it is detectable for a month or longer after rash onset. a serologic diagnosis of acute measles requires demonstration of a four-fold rise in IgG antibody titer. measles-specific antibodies in CSF are used in the diagnosis of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) levels of rubeola antibody are highly elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid of SSPE patients compared to those without the disease. mumps virus detection is a particularly important method of confirming the case. the preferred sample for viral isolation is a swab from the parotid duct. acute rubella infection can be confirmed by a four-fold rise in rubella IgG antibody titer between acute and convalescent serum specimens or by the presence of serum rubella IgM. if testing is performed, serum should be collected as early as possible. Urine cytology or quantitative NAAT may be used as a screening test, followed by BK viral load testing by NAAT, if positive. if used as a screening test, only high levels (ie, above a laboratory established threshold that correlate with disease) should be considered significant. in situ hybridization for JC virus may be performed on brain tissue. detecting JC virus DNA by NAAT in CSF specimens of patients with suspected progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. the presence of hepatitis A-specific IgM antibodies indicates either past hepatitis A infection or immunity to this viral infection from vaccination. there is no commercially available laboratory test for detecting only hepatitis A-specific IgG antibodies. the tests for hepatitis B and D disease detection are primarily serologic and molecular. check with the laboratory about minimum volumes of blood needed. some molecular platforms require more blood than others. hepatitis B surface antibody disappears and hepatitis B surface antibody is undetectable. hepatitis B core total antibodies appear at the onset of symptoms of acute hepatitis B infection and persist for life. presence indicates acute (mainly virus-specific IgM antibodies), recent (both hepatitis B core-specific IgM and IgG antibodies) or previous (hepatitis B core-specific IgG antibodies) hepatitis B infection other molecular laboratory tests used in diagnosis and management of hepatitis B infection have been reviewed. assays for determining viral genotype, detection of genotypic drug resistance mutations, and core promoter/precore mutations. signal-to-cut-off ratios are an alternative to supplemental testing. recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA) has similar sensitivity to, but higher specificity than screening tests. negative RIBA results are considered not to have HCV infection. positive RIBA results are indicative of chronic or resolved HCV infection. those with a single band detected are considered indeterminate. a commercial FDA-cleared product is available for rapid PCR testing for enteroviruses in CSF. a commercial product is available for rapid PCR testing for enteroviruses in CSF.

RT, room temperature. serologic testing may be used to document post-vaccination seroconversion in the immuno the most commonly submitted specimens for laboratory identification of these parasites are whole blood, tissue aspirates/biopsies, and serum for serologic studies. microscopy remains the cornerstone of laboratory testing for the diagnosis of most blood and tissue parasitic infections. the laboratory can enhance the sensitivity of these methods by employing a number of concentration procedures such as buffy coat examination, centrifugation, and filtration. in all of these procedures, samples must be properly obtained, transported to the laboratory as quickly as possible and processed in a timely fashion. sensitivity if the parasitemia is very low or infection is due to non-falciparum species [241] is especially important in nonendemic settings such as the u.s. where patients often present with low parasitemia. a number of reference laboratories in the u.s. and canada perform extremely sensitive nucleic acid detection methods. results are only as reliable as the experience, resources, and expertise of the laboratory performing the tests. large public health laboratories are more likely than commercial laboratories to have the experience and volume of specimens to validate the more esoteric tests. direct communication by phone or e-mail will sometimes hasten specimen processing and result reporting. balamuthia mandrillaris does not grow on standard agar (requires special cell-culture) PCR from unfixed tissue or CSF is available from the CDC. larvae may be seen in tissue sections with associated eosinophils and/or necrosis. cross-reactivity may be observed between tests for either organism. encysted larvae and/or hooklets can be seen in tissue biopsies. positive rK39 serology reported to be both sensitive and specific for diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis in various endemic areas of the world. antigen strip tests lack sensitivity in low parasitemia and non-falciparum malaria. trypanosomiasis, American (Chagas' Disease) due to trypanosoma brucei gambiense (West African) or T. b. rhodesiense (East African) Microscopy of Giemsa stained thick and thin blood films or buffy coat preps. parasitemia is often low, requiring repeated exams. there is an infection hazard from live organism in blood specimens [246, 248, 249] a \"CDC\" refers to any laboratory that performs esoteric testing not usually done in routine hospital labs. malaria is caused by Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale, P. malariae, and P. knowlesi; the latter is primarily a simian parasite in Southeast Asia which has recently been recognized in an increasing number of human patients. ium spp 1.0 mL of serum from clotted blood tube Serum should be separated from blood within several hours. store serum refrigerated or frozen if not tested within several hours. avoid use of hyperlipemic or hemolyzed blood. the thin films are prepared like a hematology peripheral smear and are fixed in ethanol before staining. fixation retains the structure of the RBCs and intraerythrocytic parasites. it provides ideal morphology for Plasmodium speciation. repeated blood samples are indicated if the initial film is negative, and malaria or babesiosis is strongly suspected. an alternative to Giemsa-stained blood films for morphologic examination is the Quantitative Buffy Coat (QBC) method. thin blood films are also necessary to determine which species other than P. falciparum is present and to determine the rate of parasitemia. this RDT is somewhat less sensitive than a thick blood film and may be falsely negative in cases with very low rates of parasitemia. rapid NAAT assays have recently been developed for malaria and babesiosis. they are available from some commercial reference laboratories and the CDC. they are comparable in sensitivity to the thick blood film and require no specialized parasitologic expertise. motile organisms can be observed in fresh wet preparations of anticoagulated blood or buffy coat. only 1%\u20132% of infected individuals present with symptoms during this time period. a minimum amount of resources must be available to obtain maximum accuracy and efficiency. ies by Giemsa/hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) stains Fluid from needle aspirate of enlarged lymph nodes or tissue biopsies from lymph nodes, skin lesions, heart, GI tract or other organ. 2 h\u20133 d Tissues may require 1\u20132 d of fixation before staining and examination. serology by commercially available enzyme-linked immunoassay kits is of greatest use during latent and chronic stages of disease. positive ELISA results are considered evidence of active infection and would exclude potential blood/tissue donors who test positive from acting as donors. each assay cannot be used for the nonapproved purpose even though they are supposed to be detecting the same antibodies. malaria is caused by Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale, P. malariae, and P. knowlesi. the latter is primarily a simian parasite in Southeast Asia. the standard method for diagnosis of both parasites is microscopic examination of Giemsa stained thick and thin blood films. it is typically more practical to obtain EDTA (preferred) or heparin anticoagulated blood and transport the sample to the laboratory for slides. s and allows for examination of multiple (20\u201330) layers of blood simultaneously. the thin films are prepared like a hematology peripheral smear. fixation retains the structure of the RBCs and intraerythrocytic parasites. it provides ideal morphology for Plasmodium speciation. repeated blood samples are indicated if the initial film is negative, and malaria or babesiosis is strongly suspected. morphologic examination is the conventional method for diagnosis of malaria but requires considerable time and expertise. negative RDTs should be confirmed by examination of thick and thin blood films. the assay should not be used to follow patients after adequate therapy has been given. rapid NAAT assays have recently been developed for malaria and babesiosis. they are available from some commercial reference laboratories and the CDC. NAATs may be useful in accurate diagnosis of acute infection if blood films are negative or difficult to obtain. Giemsa stained thick and thin blood or buffy coat films. extracellular trypanosomes will be present at this time. a minimum amount of resources must be available to obtain maximum accuracy and efficiency.
