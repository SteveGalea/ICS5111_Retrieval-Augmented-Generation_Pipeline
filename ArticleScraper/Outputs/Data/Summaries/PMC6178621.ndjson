{"summary": "in 2012, a new, related zoonotic coronavirus was identified in the middle east. both cause a range of disease from asymptomatic cases to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory failure (5). a second study found no association between MBL haplotype and SARS-CoV infection status. it was shown MBL can bind to the SARS-CoV Spike protein in vitro by some groups (11) but not by others (12). despite the existing body of literature, the role of complement in SARS-CoV pathogenesis has never been directly assessed in vivo. complement system has well-described roles in other pulmonary diseases (18), especially after influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus infection (19\u201321). complement was activated upon SARS-CoV challenge. mice deficient in C3 (C3\u2013/\u2013), the central protein of the complement signaling pathway, were protected from SARS-CoV-induced weight loss. complement signaling cascade is activated through proteolytic cleavage events. we also assessed lung proteomics samples for complement protein abundance. C4b, CfB, and C3 all had significantly higher abundances in the lungs. control mice exhibited 15% transient weight loss, with peak weight loss at day 3 postinfection. the C3\u2013/\u2013 mice were significantly protected from infection. the lack of disease in C3\u2013/\u2013 mice is uncoupled from viral replication efficiency. despite the lack of weight loss in mice, the absence of the complement pathway did not alter host control of viral replication or completely abolish respiratory disease following SARS-CoV MA15 infection. neither C4\u2013/\u2013 nor fB\u2013/\u2013 mice reproduced complete protection from weight loss observed in C3\u2013/\u2013 controls. the complement pathway-specific knockout mice were intranasally infected with 105 PFU of MA15. both show an intermediate phenotype, with significantly less weight loss than that of C57BL/6J mice. at 4 dpi, C57BL/6J mice showed pronounced lung pathology. inflammatory cells in the large airway and parenchyma, perivascular cuffing, thickening of the interstitial membrane, and low levels of intra-alveolar edema. however, the lung pathology results were not as pronounced as the complete absence of weight loss. mice were examined at 2 and 4 dpi and mock infected or infected with SARS-CoV MA15. C3\u2013/\u2013 mice showed no positive staining. c3\u2013/\u2013 mice showed no positive staining. infected C56BL/6J mice had significantly higher levels of neutrophils in the lung than infected C3\u2013/\u2013 mice. inflammatory monocytes, which have previously been associated with increased SARS-CoV MA15 pathogenesis, were significantly increased in the lungs of wild-type mice. inflammatory monocytes, which have previously been associated with increased SARS-CoV MA15 pathogenesis, were significantly increased in the lungs of wild-type mice but not C3\u2013/\u2013 we evaluated the vascular integrity of the lung following SARS-CoV MA15 infection in the presence and absence of C3. cytokine and chemokine levels are significantly decreased in the lungs of C3\u2013/\u2013 mice. inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were more highly produced in the lungs of C57BL/6J mice than in C3\u2013/\u2013 mice. all inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were measured at the highest levels at 2 dpi. inflammatory signaling remains intact in the absence of C3. Western blot analysis showed increased levels of C3a-derived fragments in the serum, indicating systemic complement activation in SARS-CoV MA15-infected mice at 2 dpi. both MCP-1 and RANTES levels were elevated in the serum following infection, regardless of mouse genetic background. rMA15 and RANTES levels are similarly elevated following infection in C57BL/6J and C3\u2013/\u2013 mice. G-CSF, KC, and IL-5 have significantly higher expression in the sera of C57BL/6J mice than in those of C3\u2013/\u2013 mice. the master regulator of complement signaling is cleaved into C3a and C3b. C3 activation products (C3 fragments C3a, C3b, iC3b, C3dg, and C3c) were detected by Western blotting in lung tissue of SARS-CoV MA15-infected mice as early as 1 day postinfection (dpi) Enhanced pause (Penh) is a calculated measure of airway resistance. the 50% exhalation force measures the exhalation force midbreath. the ratio of peak expiratory flow (RPEF) is the time to peak expiratory flow. six to 8 mice were used through day 4 and 3 to 4 mice were used for days 5 to 7. three mice were used for each infection group, and two mock-infected mice were used. both mice showed reduced weight loss relative to that of infected control mice. Error bars indicate SEM, with 8 C4\u2013/\u2013 mice, 14 C57BL/6J mice, 7 C3\u2013/\u2013 mice, and 3 fB\u2013/\u2013 mice. at day 2 postinfection, only minor effects on lung disease were observed with airway denudation and debris. staining was consistently found in the parenchyma of the lung and not in the large airways. no positive staining was observed in the lungs of C3\u2013/\u2013 mice. flow cytometry was performed at 4 dpi to identify and quantitate inflammatory cells in the lung. in parallel with humans exhibiting lung pathology, C3\u2013/\u2013 mice exhibited significant pulmonary infiltration following SARS-CoV MA15 infection. this inflammation was reduced relative to that observed in wild-type mice. infected C3\u2013/\u2013 mice produced a robust immune cell infiltration. but they had significant reductions in both inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils. the presence of activated T cells is associated with recovery following infection. cytokine and chemokine levels are significantly decreased in the lungs of C3\u2013/\u2013 mice. cytokine and chemokine levels are significantly decreased in the lungs of both C57BL/6J and C3\u2013/\u2013 mice. cytokines and chemokines were more highly produced in the lungs of C57BL/6J and C3\u2013/\u2013 mice. cytokines and chemokines were measured at the highest levels at 2 dpi. the absence of complement has an impact on the magnitude of some cytokines and chemokines in the lung. however, robust production can occur in either the presence or the absence of C3. both MCP-1 and RANTES levels were elevated in the serum following infection, regardless of mouse genetic background. however, numerous cytokines and chemokines, such as IL-5, G-CSF, and KC were present in significantly higher abundance in the lungs of C57BL/6J mice than in those of C3 knockout mice. complement system is one way that the innate immune system detects and responds to foreign antigens. it has previously been shown that complement pathway signaling is critical for the protective host immune response to various bacterial infections. viruses, including herpesviruses, poxviruses, astroviruses, flaviviruses, and retroviruses, encode genes. complement system activation can also lead to exacerbated disease. previous reports clearly established the ability of mannose-binding lectin (MBL) to bind to the SARS-CoV spike protein (11), dependent on an N-linked glycosylation site. however, the role of complement signaling in SARS-CoV pathogenesis was unclear. IL-5, IL-6, KC (CXCL1), and G-CSF have higher abundances in the lungs of wild-type mice than in C3\u2013/\u2013 mice. the neutrophils found in the lungs of C3\u2013/\u2013 mice infected with SARS-CoV MA15 had significantly more staining of major histocompatibility complex class II. IL-1 and TNF- are also more abundant in the lungs of C57BL/6J mice. wild-type but not C3\u2013/\u2013 mice develop a fever response to infection that contributes to weight loss and respiratory dysfunction phenotypes. complement pathway activation is a hallmark of bacterial infection. a host recognition of SARS-CoV MA15 infection may activate similar pathways recognizing a bacterial infection, leading to immune signaling cascades that cause systemic disease and enhance viral pathogenesis. this disease is likely mediated by complement protein deposition in the lung as well as systemic complement activation and inflammation. mice treated with either a C3a receptor antagonist or antibodies to C5a (16, 34) a similar treatment might be effective in mitigating SARS-CoV MA15-induced disease. zoonotic strains poised for cross-species transmission. mice were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine-xylazine and intranasally inoculated with 50 l of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or 105 PFU of SARS-CoV MA15 diluted in PBS. mice were monitored for disease signs and weighed at 24-h intervals. 1 ml of PBS was injected into the lung through the trachea by using a 22-gauge Exel Safelet catheter tip (Fisher) this fluid was drawn back out and used for subsequent analysis. a goat anti-mouse C3 primary antibody (MP Biomedicals) was incubated with goat anti-mouse C3 antibody. membraneanes were washed in PBS\u20130.1% Tween 20 and incubated with rabbit anti-goat-horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000; Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. mice were perfused with 10 ml of PBS via cardiac puncture. cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde overnight and then stored in PBS until acquisition within 24 h. analysis was completed using FlowJo software version 10 (TreeStar) doublet exclusion, dead-cell exclusion based on uptake of a fixable live/dead cell discriminator (Invitrogen) and CD45-LCA expression before downstream analyses. mice were loaded into individual chambers and allowed to acclimate for 30 min before a 5-min measurement window. mice were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine-xylazine and intranasally inoculated with 50 l of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or 105 PFU of SARS-CoV MA15 diluted in PBS. all experiments using live virus were performed in a certified biosafety level 3 laboratory. mice were euthanized using an overdose of isoflurane. lung tissue was fixed in 10% formalin. tissues were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was immediately following euthanasia. proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Bio-Rad) membranes were blocked in 1 PBS\u20135% milk\u20130.1% Tween 20 and incubated with goat anti-mouse C3 antibody overnight at 4\u00b0C. mice were perfused with 10 ml of PBS via cardiac puncture.
