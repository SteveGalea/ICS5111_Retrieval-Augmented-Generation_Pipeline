{"summary": "in 1992, the Institute of Medicine published an influential report calling attention to the emergence and re-emergence of human pathogens. renewed concern about microbial threats to health spurred new investments in scientific research and public health infrastructure. in 2003, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic acutely challenged the response capacity of scientists and public health officials across the globe. scientists identified the origin of all eight influenza virus gene segments within days of the initial identification of the first cases of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) in spring 2009. within two weeks, the centers for disease control and prevention (CDC) began to distribute RT-PCR diagnostic test kits to public health laboratories under a quickly granted emergency use authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration [8-10]. of the more than 40,000 studies in the database, most focus on chronic diseases; however, more than 2,000 so far are related to infectious diseases. GWASs have become a powerful tool for systematically searching the human genome for novel associations with infectious diseases. Molecular epidemiology has long been a mainstay of public health surveillance; now, increasingly powerful molecular methods, including sequencing of whole pathogen genomes, help investigators to identify epidemiologically related cases. human genome studies can now be accomplished in the time that pathogen studies required only a decade ago. additional planning and investment are needed to support the collection and storage of specimens that allow for comprehensive evaluation of key attributes of pathogen and host. regulations regarding privacy and human subjects' research protection do not always apply to these activities. scientists from diverse disciplines - epidemiology, laboratory, social sciences - must work together to respond to immediate threats. the results of such research are needed to inform policy, develop treatments and interventions, and to update and adjust recommendations as the state of knowledge changes. such research should be based on sound protocols that protect human subjects."}
