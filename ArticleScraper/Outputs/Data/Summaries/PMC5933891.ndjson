{"summary": "innate defense molecules of ancient origin can be traced back to organisms from approximately 500 million years ago. the history of the discovery of human defensins has been reviewed elsewhere. Defensins are known for their antimicrobial functions as innate defense molecules. 'universal vaccines' or 'broadly neutralizing antibodies' have been of particular interest in recent years to address the problem of annual vaccine update due to ceaseless antigenic changes in the virus. however, regardless of the presence of defensins in the human body and the reported antiviral effects of defensins against viruses. defensins belong to the category of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), which have a non-enzymatic inhibitory effect on a broad spectrum of microorganisms. AMPs are universally present in organisms in one form or another. defensins have antiviral effects on both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. membrane disruption is presumed to be one of the antiviral mechanisms of defensins against enveloped viruses. other antiviral mechanisms of defensins appear to be based on their specific binding to certain viral proteins. defensins appear to participate in the enhancement of adaptive antiviral responses by attracting antigen-presenting cells to the sites of infection and stimulating them. the monomeric structure of HBD1 (PDB ID: 1IJU) is common in all known structures of - and -defensins. a computational search of the human genome has identified at least 31 -defensin genes. HBDs are synthesized as prepropeptides, the mature forms of which are approximately 35\u201350 amino acids in length. HADs and HBDs are structurally conserved in spite of their significant differences in genetic sequences. HAdV HD5 Mechanism of non-enveloped virus inactivation. blocking of uncoating by binding to capsid proteins. HNP1 Reduction of adenoviral infection by more than 95%. HNP4 Inhibition of X4 and R5 HIV-1 is more effective than HNP1-3. HBD2, 3 Irreversible effect on virion infectivity by binding to viral particle. IAV HNP1-3 Antiviral activity of HAD in human gingival epithelial cells at a physiological concentration. HNP1-2, HD5, HBD2 Aggregation of IAV and enhanced neutrophil-mediated clearance (HBD2 activity lower than HAD) ANTIVIRAL ACTIVITIES OF DEFENSINS The antiviral activities of human defensins have been studied on various viruses. herpes simplex virus (HSV) was one of the first viruses to be studied for the antiviral activity of HADs. HIV is the most studied target of defensins. despite the in vitro neutralization activity of Paneth cell -defensins, their absence had no effect on the kinetics and magnitude of MAdV-1 dissemination to the brain. these studies suggest that the inhibition of virus replication by defensins in vitro might not necessarily be relevant in vivo. the question is whether more defensins \u2013 either constitutive or virus infection-induced \u2013 would help clear the virus. semple et al. (2015) showed that HBD3 enhanced the production of interferon- (IFN) in response. high concentrations of HAD can induce cytotoxicity. a high concentration of HBD appears not to have a cytotoxic effect in vitro. studies suggest higher copy numbers of HBD genes can be associated with diseases such as psoriasis. the evolutionary longevity of defensins may be proof of this. a question that may prove challenging to answer is whether a prophylactic application of defensins can serve as a one-shot vaccination in the case of adaptive defense. we have not found reports of overexpression of human defensins. the excess supply of therapeutic defensins derived independently of eukaryotic cells might be another approach. the chemical synthesis of human defensins and the purification of bacterially expressed human defensins have been reported. there are scant examples of in vivo applications of excess amounts of human defensins that are produced in bacteria or chemically synthesized as an antiviral defense. there are also few examples of the use of non-human defensins in mouse models. titer in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluids was reduced and rMBD3 provided 80% protection. rMBD3 enhanced virus-induced expression of IL-12 and IFN in a dose-dependent manner while downregulating virus-induced expression of IFN in vivo. elaboration of the translatability of murine models of eukaryotic cell-independently derived human defensins to humans. these two approaches are expected to complement each other. the formidable amount of work needed before the realization of the application of human defensins as antivirals is daunting. defensins are positively charged and have lectin-like glycan-binding activities. heparin/heparan sulfate proteoglycan activity of defensins inhibits viral binding and entry into the cells. affinities to viral glycoproteins might have been more informative. studies using other HSPG-binding viruses would also help determine therapeutic potential of human defensins against these viruses. mohan et al. (2014) showed an adjuvant-like effect of HBD2 and HBD3 on the immune responses to the gp41 antigen of HIV in a mouse model. this finding suggests that human defensins may have adjuvant-like activities in humans similar to those observed for murine defensins. standalone application of adjuvant-like activity of defensins could truly be a broad-spectrum antiviral measure. we postulate the likely standalone applications of the adjuvant-like activity of defensins, apart from their applications as conventional vaccine adjuvants. the therapeutic adjuvant activity of defensins in the setting of virus infection leads to the production of Th1-promoting cytokines. an in vivo experiment showing protection of an RSV-infected animal by a therapeutic defensin treatment would be especially relevant. black arrows indicate processes affected by constitutively expressed or physiologically induced defensins. orange arrows indicate processes not likely to be influenced by the overexpressed defensins due to the systemic nature of their overexpression. Defensins (2) exaggerate viral RNA-mediated IFN I induction. innate arm of defense inhibits virus replication and removes virus-infected cells. overexpressed defensins would increase systemic levels of defensins. defensin-enhanced efficacy of therapeutic antibodies has implications beyond the enhancement of the efficacy of therapeutic antibodies. enhanced immune responses towards neutralizing antibody generation would lead to a better uptake of the antigen by neutralizing epitope-specific B cell receptor (BCR)-bearing B cells. there is no study showing an interaction between human defensins and surface proteins of DENV. there is the possibility of an interaction between the surface glycoproteins of DENV and a lectin-like human defensin. defensin-overexpressing mice attained higher systemic basal levels of IFN is debatable. the role of enhanced systemic basal levels of IFN due to the systemic presence of overexpressed defensins is debatable. semple et al. (2015) and Li et al. (2014) may have been the source of the elevated basal level of IFN I. defensin-mediated IFN induction in RNA viruses could be applied to all of the proposed target viruses (HIV, IAV, RSV, and DENV) a prophylactic \u2018defensin vaccination\u2019 might prime the body to an IFN-pretreated state. temporary overexpression of defensins mediated an exaggeration of a viral induction of IFN. the subsequent co-antiviral activity of defensins and IFN can be observed in the same light as clinically practiced IFN therapies. the greatest advantage of human defensins may be that they are peptides, enabling us to sustain their controlled production in vivo through gene expression. the postulated scheme of the prophylactic application of defensins may appear to be an oversimplification. more defensins \u2013 either constitutive or virus infection-induced \u2013 would help clear the virus. the question is whether more defensins \u2013 either constitutive or virus infection-induced \u2013 would help clear the virus. a prophylactically administered excess amount of relevant human defensins may be able to similarly reduce the viral titer in humans infected with a virus. a high concentration of HBD appears not to have a cytotoxic effect in vitro. studies suggest that higher copy numbers of HBD genes can be associated with diseases such as psoriasis. in real-life infections, the mobilization of the adaptive arm of the immune system against the target pathogen may occur earlier than the development of resistance to defensins in the target pathogen. a question that may prove challenging to answer is whether a prophylactic application of defensins can serve as a one-shot vaccination in the case of adaptive defense. a local transfer of allogeneic cells infected with an HBD4-expressing Newcastle disease virus vector was used as an effective therapeutic application. others showed the feasibility of an adenovirus-mediated human defensin gene delivery as an antibacterial therapy. the excess supply of therapeutic defensins derived independently of eukaryotic cells might be another approach. there are scant examples of in vivo applications of excess amounts of human defensins that are produced in bacteria or chemically synthesized as an antiviral defense. there are also few examples of the use of non-human defensins in mouse models. treatment of mice began 12 h post-infection and was performed once per day for three weeks. rMBD3 enhanced virus-induced expression of IL-12 and IFN in a dose-dependent manner while downregulating virus-induced expression of IFN in vivo. a murine model of defensin gene delivery-mediated temporary overexpression, a constructive exaggeration of the natural process, to eliminate the many unknowns associated with the application of defensins derived independently of eukaryotic cells. elaboration of the translatability of murine models of eukaryotic cell-independently derived human defensins to humans is expected to complement each other. antiviral mechanisms of human defensins can conceptually be applied as therapeutic measures. heparin/heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG)-binding activity of defensins inhibits viral binding and entry into the cells. studies using other HSPG-binding viruses would help determine therapeutic potential of human defensins against these viruses. studies using other HSPG-binding viruses, such as HIV, RSV, and DENV, would also help determine the therapeutic potential of human defensins. mohan et al. (2014) showed an adjuvant-like effect of HBD2 and HBD3 on the immune responses to the gp41 antigen of HIV. this finding suggests that human defensins may have adjuvant-like activities in humans similar to those observed for murine defensins. a protective efficacy beyond the natural innate and adaptive responses requires an excess amount of defensins. the standalone application of adjuvant-like activity of defensins, apart from their applications as conventional vaccine adjuvants, could truly be a broad-spectrum antiviral measure. experimental data suggest the therapeutic adjuvant activity of defensins leads to the production of Th1-promoting cytokines. an in vivo experiment showing protection of an RSV-infected animal by a therapeutic defensin treatment would be especially relevant. black arrows indicate processes affected by constitutively expressed or physiologically induced defensins. orange arrows indicate processes not likely to be influenced by the overexpressed defensins due to the systemic nature of their overexpression. Defensins (2) exaggerate viral RNA-mediated IFN I induction. innate arm of defense (IFN I, defensins, and NK cells) inhibits virus replication. defensin-enhanced efficacy of therapeutic antibodies has implications beyond the enhancement of the efficacy of therapeutic antibodies. enhanced immune responses towards neutralizing antibody generation would lead to a better uptake of the antigen by neutralizing epitope-specific B cell receptor (BCR)-bearing B cells. s could expose the neutralizing epitope to the neutralizing epitope-specific BCR-bearing B cells. fresh immune responses might gain access to the antigen. there is no study showing an interaction between human defensins and surface proteins of DENV. possible use of adjuvant-like activity of defensins is as a prophylactic. it might provide a vaccine-like effect, the feasibility of which we posed as a challenging question earlier. defensin-mediated IFN induction in RNA viruses could be applied to all of the proposed target viruses (HIV, IAV, RSV, and DENV) it is conceivable that a shot of a defensin expression construct could be given in preparation for a flu season, prior to travel to a DENV-endemic area. defensins were also shown to induce and be inhibited by type 1 IFN. a prophylactic \u2018defensin vaccination\u2019 might prime the body to an IFN-pretreated state. human defensins may be peptides, enabling us to sustain their controlled production in vivo through gene expression. the postulated scheme of the vaccine-like prophylactic application of defensins may appear to be an oversimplification. prophylactic \u2018defensin vaccine\u2019 concept of controlled overexpression of defensins. it is akin to manually operating the \u2018safety lock\u2019 of natural defensin expression program as needed."}
