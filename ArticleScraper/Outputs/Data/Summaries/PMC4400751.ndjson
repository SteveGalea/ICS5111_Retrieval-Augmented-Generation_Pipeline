{"summary": "a 19-month-old girl with severe acute respiratory distress was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit. the child was born at term and healthy but had a history of repeated episodes of bronchiolitis that required hospitalization when she was 5, 6 and 8 months old. no allergic sensitization was known, and she had received no treatment for asthma or any inhaled corticosteroids. nucleic acids were extracted with the NucliSENS easyMAG automated system. different specimens tested for human enterovirus (HEV), human herpesviruses (HHV) 1 to 6, Pneumocystis jirovecii, and a panel of 22 respiratory pathogens. phylogenetic analysis confirmed the genotype assignment (data not shown) globally, these PCR typing results excluded an HEV infection and were in favor of a cross-detection of HRV-C8 by the Cepheid HEV-specific PCR. respiratory virus multiplex PCR assay used was the Respifinder SMART 22. autopsy revealed significant abnormalities only in the lungs and trachea. real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and VP4-VP2 sequencing performed on nucleic acids extracted from a frozen lung autopsy fragment confirmed the presence of HRV-C8. human airway epithelium reconstituted in vitro and inoculated with HRV-A16. RNA load measured 4 h postinoculation represents leftover inoculum. nasopharyngeal aspirate is the most frequent cause of cold and other self-limited upper respiratory tract illnesses. HRV RNA was detected at a low level in the CSF and at higher concentrations in the lung and fecal samples. the latter observation suggests replication in the gastrointestinal tract. an open question remains whether this HRV-C strain resisted the acidic environment of the gastrointestinal tract. authentic viremia with HRV-C may occur in given situations. presence of HRV-C in the bloodstream could affect the clinical outcome of viral infection."}
