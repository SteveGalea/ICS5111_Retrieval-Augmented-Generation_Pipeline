{"summary": "there has been no pan-European study determining the current FeLV prevalence in domestic cats. there has been no pan-European study determining the current FeLV prevalence in domestic cats. a recent meta-analysis suggested an indirect relation between FeLV prevalence and the yearly gross domestic product per capita. the aim of the present study was to determine the current prevalence of FeLV viraemia in cats that visit a veterinary facility. 10 animals arriving consecutively at each facility were tested independently of the reason for the appointment. the sample collection was conducted from September 2016 to March 2017. numbers of veterinarians, samples shipped and returned, and feline leukaemia virus prevalence in the different countries or country groups. n.a. n.a. n.a.

RNA was detected using 5 L of TNA and a previously described real-time TaqMan FeLV RT-qPCR [37] on an ABI PRISM 7500 Fast Sequence Detection System. the 25-L reaction contained 12.5 L 2 RT-qPCR Buffer, 1 L 25 RT-qPCR Enzyme Mix. TNA was extracted from 50 L of original liquid sample material. FeLV real-time RT-qPCR was performed as described above. pre-Experiment The stability of FeLV in the RNA shield was tested. statistical analyses were carried out in STATA/SE 14.2 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA) the limit of statistical significance of the tests performed was defined as 0.05. classification trees are trained by passing data down from a root node to leaves. data is repeatedly split according to predictor variables so that child nodes are more \u201cpure\u201d (i.e., homogeneous) in terms of the outcome variable (i.e., FeLV status) the study design included 920 european veterinary facilities in 32 countries. for organizational/financial reasons, some small countries were grouped into country groups. the countries/country groups were classified into \u201cEastern Europe\u201d, \u201cNorthern Europe\u201d, \u201cSouthern Europe\u201d and \u201cWestern Europe\u201d according to the United Nations geoscheme [29]. 0 0.0 (0.0\u20131.1) United Kingdom 40 40 400 136 34.0 1 0.7 (3.8 104\u20134.0) England 32 32 320 119 37.1 1 Scotland 4 4 40 10 25.0 0 Northern Ireland 2 2 20 0 0.0 0 Wales 2 2 20 7 35.0 0 Eastern Europe Bulgaria, Romania 40 24 240 90 37.5 0 0.0 (0.0\u20134.1) Bulgaria 11 11 110 90 81.8 0 Romania 29 13 130 0 0 n.a.

FeLV prevalence (viraemia) in sick and healthy cats and frequencies of FeLV viral RNA loads were analysed using the chi-square test (pChi) or Fisher\u2019s exact test (pF) a multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed using variables with p-values 0.20. backward stepwise logistic regression was used to exclude progressively variables having the highest p-value. the process was repeated until each 1/10th data subset had been used to test a tree that had been grown using 9/10ths of the data. the results of the 10 mini-tests were combined to calculate the error rates for trees of each possible size. this complex process resulted in a set of fairly reliable estimates of the independent predictive accuracy of the tree. statistical analyses were carried out in STATA/SE 14.2 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA) the limit of statistical significance of the tests performed was defined as 0.05. classification trees are trained by passing data down from a root node to leaves. data is repeatedly split according to predictor variables so that child nodes are more \u201cpure\u201d (i.e., homogeneous) in terms of the outcome variable (i.e., FeLV status) analysis was carried out in a Salford Predictive Modeler (Salford Systems, San Diego, CA, USA) results 3.1.

Approximately two-thirds (63%) of the samples contained high FeLV viral RNA loads with >106 copies per PCR reaction. FeLV-positive sick cats more frequently displayed anaemia (OR 9.6, 95% CI: 4.4\u201321.4; pF 0.0001), anorexia (OR 3.5, 95% CI: 1.6\u20138.3; pF = 0.0122) than FeLV-negative sick cats. study aimed to include 32 countries, of which 30 successfully contributed samples. saliva samples collected using buccal swabs were analysed for FeLV viral RNA. the results were comparable with those of other studies measuring free FeLV p27 antigen in blood samples. rabies are encountered in some of the countries included in the study. the prevalence of FeLV viraemia differed significantly in cats living in different regions of Europe. cats in northern and western Europe were at a lower risk of being FeLV-infected, while cats living in southern european countries were at a much greater risk. the prevalence of FeLV in the UK was low in the present study. only one viraemic cat amongst 119 returned samples in the uk. the return rate of samples was the lowest in the present study. a higher FeLV prevalence among the northern european countries was found in Ireland. this was higher than the prevalence reported previously in a study investigating 112 client-owned and stray cats in the Dublin area in 2007/2008. however, among the seven FeLV-positive cats in Ireland, five cats had undergone appointments at only two veterinary facilities in Galway and Kerry county. it is not clear why the FeLV prevalence did not decrease further in recent years. not all cats at risk of FeLV infection appear to have been identified and FeLV vaccinated in time. the prevalence of FeLV was below the overall european prevalence. a national study carried out in 1863 cats of northern and central Italy examined in clinical settings found an average prevalence of 15.3% with 12% of prevalence in Lombardy. the highest positivity percentages in the northern\u2013eastern area of the country were reported in lazio (7.5%) and Liguria (7.3%). free-living outdoor cats (gatti liberi) have been protected by law (no-kill no-moving policy) since 1991. there are registered cat caretakers and compulsory neutering of the cats by the Veterinary Services of the local health unit. in other Italian regions and other countries, there remain concerns regarding free-roaming cats in general. an even higher prevalence of 14.2% was reported in a study investigating 741 mainly sick cats in the area of Warsaw. none of the 90 tested cats from Bulgaria were FeLV-positive. this could be related to the small number of samples tested or the cats taken to veterinarians in Bulgaria might be well cared for. the median age of FeLV viraemic cats was 3 years in a recent study. adult cats, defined as cats older than 6 months, were more likely to be FeLV viraemic (odds ratio 2.5) than juveniles up to 6 months of age. clinical signs associated with FeLV infection in the cats reported in the present study were primarily anaemia, but also anorexia and gingivitis/stomatitis. clinical signs that were associated with FeLV infection in the cats reported in the present study were primarily anaemia, but also anorexia and gingivitis/stomatitis. the study provides unique data on the prevalence of FeLV viraemia and FeLV vaccination rates for many geographic areas of Europe. there are still countries with high FeLV prevalence and low vaccination rates, e.g., Portugal, Italy, Croatia, and Poland. FeLV-positive cases were grouped into two terminal nodes. the first terminal node corresponds to cats living in northern and western Europe. in this terminal node 2, only eight FeLV-positive cats were present within a total of 3511 cats living in northern or western Europe. the prevalence of FeLV in stray and feral cats that do not attend any veterinary facilities might even be higher in many countries. in countries where FeLV remains prevalent, cats with outdoor access should be vaccinated and\u2014also for the welfare of the cats\u2014neutered."}
