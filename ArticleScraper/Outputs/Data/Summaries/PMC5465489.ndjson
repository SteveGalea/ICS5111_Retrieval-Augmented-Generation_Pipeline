{"summary": "the flavoenzyme proline dehydrogenase (PRODH)4 catalyzes the FAD-dependent oxidation of l-proline to the cyclic imine 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) hydrolysis of P5C generates the open-chain aldehyde, l-glutamate--semialdehyde (GSALDH) which is the substrate for the second enzyme of the pathway, GSAL putAs catalyze reactions using highly conserved active sites. surprisingly diverse in terms of domain architecture, sequence similarity, oligomeric state and quaternary structure. the PutA phylogenetic tree has three main branches. the pairwise sequence identities between PutAs from different branches are typically 30%, suggesting substantial differences. phylogeny yields five PutA classes designated by the branch number and domain architecture type. type C PutAs form a third distinct type of dimer, which is mediated by the DNA-binding domain (19). the structure of the 3B PutA from Corynebacterium freiburgense exhibits novel features. the steady-state kinetic parameters describing the PRODH activity were measured using the dichlorophenolindophenol assay. when proline is the variable substrate, the kinetic parameters are Km of 145 mm and kcat of 2.6 s1, which correspond to a catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of 18 m1 s1. the GSALDH activity of CfPutA using P5C revealed a Km of 54 m and a kcat of 1.7 s1, corresponding to a catalytic efficiency of 32,000 m1 s1 (4, 6). the kcat/Km values of other PutAs span the range of 4800\u2013214,000 m1 s1 (4, 6). 63.29 to 2.70 (2.75 to 2.70) 63.07 to 3.30 (3.43 to 3.30) Observations 260,275 (12,837) 434,766 (44,854) Unique reflections 137,220 (6798) 40,228 (4491) Rmerge(I) 0.058 (0.488) 0.177 (1.224) Rmeas(I) 0.082 (0.689) 0.186 (1.224) Rpim(I) tA resembles other PutAs in both the folds and spatial arrangement. similarity of CfPutA to SmPutA (27% identity) is lower, with a root mean square deviation of 1.8 over 941 residues. the GSALDH module features the two-domain architecture common to all ALDHs. the module consists of a Rossmann fold NAD+-binding domain (residues 475\u2013689 and 891\u2013908) and an / catalytic domain (residues 690\u2013890), which contains catalytic Cys-723. the ALDHSF domains of CfPutA and SmPutA differ in two respects. the / subdomain of SmPutA is a complete Rossmann domain. the -domain contacts the PRODH barrel, GSALDH catalytic. the disordered section starts just after helix 8 of the PRODH barrel. it contains several conserved residues that interact with the substrate proline in the Michaelis complex. the disordered section starts just after helix 8 of the PRODH barrel. the ribityl 2\u2032-OH group is under the pyrimidine ring of the isoalloxazine. the 3\u2032-OH is directed toward the FAD ribose. the 4\u2032-OH sits under the dimethylbenzene ring. the inset shows an edge-on view of the isoalloxazine ring. the inset shows an edge-on view of the isoalloxazine ring. the two FADs have the same ribityl conformation but different butterfly bend angles. analysis of protein-protein interfaces in the P1 crystal lattice with PDBePISA revealed no stable assemblies. the largest interface is a two-body assembly formed by chains A and B, which has an interfacial area of 1100 2. ligand-induced protein dimerization CfPutA was crystallized with NAD+ in the GSALDH active site and the PRODH proline site unoccupied. we hypothesized that the lack of a PRODH ligand could be responsible for the unprecedented level of disorder observed in the crystal structure. CfPutA undergoes concentration-dependent oligomerization in the presence of active-site ligands. results of this assay show a 52% decrease in steady-state P5C-oAB conjugate formation in the presence of NAD+. the calculated theoretical value of for CfPutA is 1.2 min. for wild-type CfPutA, the production of NADH versus time is approximately linear with no substantial lag phase. thermal shift assay melt curves are shown for wild-type CfPutA (black), CfPutA S916* (red), and CfPutA Y927* (blue). thermal shift assay melt curves are shown for wild-type CfPutA (black), CfPutA S916* (red), and CfPutA Y927* (blue). PutAFAD was experimentally estimated to be 13,100 m1 cm1. measure of the flavin spectrum indicated 0.3 mol of FAD/mol of CfPutA (30% incorporation) this value is lower than other PutAs, which have FAD incorporation ranging from 60% (20) to > 80% (7, 21, 22) the GSALDH activity of CfPutA using P5C revealed a Km of 54 m and a kcat of 1.7 s1. the kcat/Km values of other PutAs span the range of 4800\u2013214,000 m1 s1 (4, 6). the GSALDH activity of CfPutA is not unusual. al Space group P1 P3121 Unit cell parameters a = 85.0, b = 116.4, c = 140.7 a = 145.6, c = 214.3 Degrees = 71.5, = 89.7, = 83.4 Wavelength 1.000 1.000 Resolution () 63.29 to 2.70 (2.75 to 2.70) 63.07 to 3.30 (3.43 to 3.30) Observations 260,275 (12,837) 434,766 (44,854) Unique despite the low sequence identity to other PutAs, CfPutA resembles other PutAs. similarity of CfPutA to SmPutA (27% identity) is lower, with a root mean square deviation of 1.8 over 941 residues. the core of the PRODH module is a distorted ()8 barrel (residues 130\u2013420) containing the FAD bound at the C termini of the strands of the barrel. the GSALDH module consists of a Rossmann fold NAD+-binding domain and an / catalytic domain (residues 690\u2013890), which contains catalytic Cys-723. the -flap appears to facilitate substrate channeling by covering a large section of the tunnel that connects the two active sites. the truncation points for the S916* and Y927* C-terminal deletion mutants are marked by arrowheads. the -domain contacts the PRODH barrel, GSALDH catalytic domain, and ALDHSF -flap. the disordered section starts just after helix 8 of the PRODH barrel. the disordered section starts just after helix 8 of the PRODH barrel. the ribityl 2\u2032-OH group is under the pyrimidine ring of the isoalloxazine. the 3\u2032-OH is directed toward the FAD ribose. the 4\u2032-OH sits under the dimethylbenzene ring. the cage represents a simulated annealing A-weighted Fo Fc omit map (3.0). the inset shows an edge-on view of the isoalloxazine ring. crystal structure data consistent with sedimentation-velocity results. largest interface is a two-body assembly formed by chains A and B. largest interface in that crystal form buries 1050 2. ligand-induced protein dimerization CfPutA was crystallized with NAD+ in the GSALDH active site and the PRODH proline site unoccupied. we hypothesized that the lack of a PRODH ligand could be responsible for the unprecedented level of disorder observed in the crystal structure. CfPutA undergoes concentration-dependent oligomerization in the presence of active-site ligands. results of this assay on CfPutA show a 52% decrease in steady-state P5C-oAB conjugate formation in the presence of NAD+. a non-channeling model calculated from Equation 1 is represented in orange. the dotted black line represents extrapolation of the predicted steady-state rate to estimate a transient time of 1.2 min. production of NADH versus time is approximately linear with no substantial lag phase. truncation mutants displayed similar unfolding profile with T0.5 values of 48.4 0.2 \u00b0C (range of 48.1\u201348.6 \u00b0C) and 48.9 0.2 \u00b0C (range of 48.7\u201349.2 \u00b0C), respectively. deletion of the ALDHSF domain does not result in apparent destabilization of CfPutA tertiary structure. all three branches are represented in the PDB. only the class 1C structure remains unsolved in its full-length form. the catalytic part of 1C PutA should be very similar to that of SmPutA. deletion of the ALDHSF domain in CfPutA nearly eliminates PRODH activity. the ALDHSF domain must play a role in promoting the activity of the PRODH active site. the -flap of the C-terminal ALDHSF domain of type B PutA is structurally similar to the oligomerization flap of type A PutAs (8). structural basis for activation is unknown, but it has been proposed that isomerization associated with ligand binding provokes conformational changes that assemble the PRODH active site and seal leaky parts of the tunnel system. ylalanine hydroxylase catalyzes the first step in the l-phenylalanine to l-tyrosine biosynthetic pathway. multiple oligomeric states of DegP, an E. coli periplasmic protease, are observed in response to various substrate-mimicking peptide fragments. substrate binding to the catalytic site of porphobilinogen synthase causes conformational changes in the monomeric ligand binding promotes oligomerization of these PutAs. it remains to be investigated whether the CfPutA dimer resembles the SmPutA dimer. if so, this dimer might be a hallmark of type B PutAs. protein expression vectors were transformed into BL21(DE3) cells. a 20-ml overnight starter culture was used to inoculate 1 liter of LB. the temperature was then shifted to 18 \u00b0C. s containing protein were pooled, supplemented with 0.1 mm FAD and 0.5 mm Tris(hydroxypropyl)phosphine (THP) the His tag was removed by adding 1 mg of tobacco etch virus protease per 30 mg of target protein, incubating for 2 h at 28 \u00b0C, and then dialyzing overnight at 4 \u00b0C. the sample was then passed over a hisTrap HP nickel-affinity column. mm FAD, 1 mm NAD+, 10 mm THFA at pH 8.0 and dialyzed for 4 h with two buffer exchanges against a buffer containing the same components. the protein was quick-cooled in liquid nitrogen in PCR-strip tubes. Approximately 120 crystals were surveyed at beamline 4.2.2 of the Advanced Light Source. only one crystal diffracted significantly beyond 3.0, from which a 2.70 resolution data set was obtained for structure determination. crystal screening trials also produced crystals shaped like hexagonal bipyramids. a 3.3 resolution data set was collected for the purpose of inspecting oligomeric assemblies. the space group is P3121 with unit cell dimensions a = 146 and c = 214. the asymmetric unit contains one CfPutA monomer. the sequence identity between 3QAN and CfPutA is only 33%. the search model represented only 46% of CfPutA. the phases were improved by density modification and automated model building. tinamide of NAD+ was weak and diffuse, so this group was not included in the deposited structure. electron density maps indicated the presence of a sulfate ion in the aldehyde site of the GSALDH module. the radial distribution of the sample was monitored with Rayleigh interference optics. the data set was analyzed globally to obtain the sedimentation coefficient (c(s)) and molecular mass (c(M) distributions using Sedfit (50) GSALDH activity was monitored by following NADH formation at 340 nm (340 = 6200 m1 cm1) data were collected using a KC4TM plate reader (BioTek) Km and kcat were calculated by fitting observed initial velocities to the Michaelis-Menten equation (SigmaPlot version 12.0) in the absence of substrate channeling, the observed transient time to achieve steady-state production of NADH is the ratio of the GSALDH kinetic parameters, Km/v2. if substrate channeling occurs, the observed will be smaller than the limiting value of Km/v2. the percentage of flavin incorporation was then determined from the concentration ratio of FAD-bound CfPutA to total CfPutA. protein solutions were loaded into a microAmp 96-well optical plate at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm THP, and 5% (v/v) glycerol. the synthetic construct includes a 5\u2032 NdeI restriction site, a coding sequence of an 8 His tag, and a 3\u2032 XhoI restriction site. for protein expression, the construct was subcloned into the pET22b vector backbone. unbroken cells and cell debris were pelleted by centrifugation at 16,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C in an SS-34 rotor. the supernatant was then loaded onto a hisTrap HP nickel-affinity column. protein was eluted with 300 mm imidazole. eluted protein was supplemented with 0.2 mm FAD, 1 mm NAD+, and 10 mm THFA at pH 8.0. eluted protein was quick-cooled in liquid nitrogen in PCR-strip tubes. only CfPutA was crystallizable. crystals were cryoprotected using the reservoir supplemented with 20% (v/v) PEG 200, picked up with nylon loops, and quick-cooled in liquid nitrogen. only one crystal diffracted significantly beyond 3.0, from which a 2.70 resolution data set was obtained for structure determination. 80 crystals were surveyed at beamline 4.2.2 of the Advanced Light Source. diffraction was limited to 3.3\u20133.5 resolution. a 3.3 resolution data set was collected to inspect oligomeric assemblies. LBES generated search models from the structures of BjPutA (PDB code 3HAZ), three bacterial GSALDHs (PDB codes 1UZB, 3QAN, and 3RJL), human succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (PDB code 2W8N), and a few structures unrelated to PutA. the best solution was obtained with 3QAN and had a Q-factor of 0.55, and 85% probability of the second-generation autobuild model was the starting point for several rounds of model building in COOT (42) and refinement in PHENIX (43). non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were used during refinement. the B-factor model consisted of TLS refinement (one group/chain) plus an isotropic B-factor for each non-hydrogen atom. buffer were loaded into a sedimentation-velocity cell equipped with a dual-sector charcoal-Epon centerpiece. the reference buffer was an eluted fraction lacking protein. the sample was centrifuged at 35,000 rpm following a 2-h temperature equilibration. the low activity of the C-terminal truncation mutants prohibited the determination of Km and kcat. the apparent catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) was estimated by linear regression of rate data measured below saturation (Origin 2016). NADH = v 1 t + ( v 1 / v 2 ) K m ( e v 2 t / K m 1 ) is the rate of PRODH activity under the reaction conditions (1.03 mmin1). in the absence of substrate channeling, the observed will be smaller than the limiting value of Km/v2. incubation with 0.5% (w/v) SDS was performed for 1 h prior to recording the UV-visible spectrum. the percentage of flavin incorporation was then determined from the concentration ratio of FAD-bound CfPutA to total CfPutA. a protocol in which the plate was heated from 4 to 95 \u00b0C in 0.5 \u00b0C steps with a 20-s hold following each step. data were exported using QuantStudio version 3 software."}
