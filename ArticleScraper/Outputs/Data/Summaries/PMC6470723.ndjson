{"summary": "primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) are a phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous group of more than 300 monogenic inherited disorders. PIDs with a more severe phenotype lead to life-threatening infections and life-limiting complications that require a prompt and accurate diagnosis. characterization of PID-associated genes is expected to significantly contribute to define the molecular events governing immune system development. 105 patients presenting with either typical SCID/CID or with overlapping PID phenotypes have been identified. three diagnostic panels were developed for the Ion Torrent platform (ThermoFisher) nine of these patients have been enrolled in the pCID study. data were obtained from year 2014 to 2017. 1 RAG1 CHRONIC CMV VIREMIA, PNEUMOCYSTOSIS, HERPETIC KERATITIS TUBULE INTERSTITIAL NEPHRITIS WITH LYMPHO-MONOCYTE INFILTRATE T+, B-, NK+ PID 2 2 mo M SCID ION TORRENT PANEL 1 RAG2 EBV AND ADENOVIRUS POST HSCT T+ (CD4, CD8), B- VERTEBRAL WEDGING AND OSTEOPENIA T (ABSENT NAIVE and RTE), B+, NK+ PID 9 9mo F SCID ION TORRENT PANEL 1-2 GLUTEAL ABSCESS CHRONIC DIARRHEA T+ (CM CD4, ), B-, NK- PID 10 2mo F SCID ION TORRENT PANEL 1-2 POST-NATAL CMV INFECTION; URI; PNEUMONIA PNEUMONIA, DERMATITIS, GROWTH FAILURE T+/-, B-, NK+ PID 17 1y M SCID ION TORRENT PANEL 1 IL2RG CHRONIC CMV VIREMIA, BRONCHIOLITIS, UTI, ROTAVIRUS ENTERITIS HEPATOSPLENOMEGALY, HLH T (ABSENT NAIVE CD4 and CD8), B-, IRUS, ROTAVIRUS ENTERITIS, PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA T-, B-, NK+, IgM, IgA, IgE PID 23 11mo F SCID ION TORRENT PANEL 1 JAK3 CHRONIC HHV-6 VIREMIA, CANDIDA ALBICANS, ROTAVIRUS, CORONAVIRUS 229E, T-, B+, NK, NK RRENT PANEL 1 RAG1 CHRONIC CMV AND EBV VIREMIA, HAEMOPHILUS INFLUENZAE AND BOCAVIRUS RESPIRATORY INFECTION, LONG-LASTING ROTAVIRUS DIARRHEA THROMBOCYTOPENIA, AHIA, SEVERE HEPATOSPLENOMEGALY, WITH LIVER FAILURE T, B+, NK+, IgE, Ig X PANEL 1 COLITIS, GH DEFICIENCY LYMPHOPENIA, T, B, NK (UNDER AZA) PID 36 15 mo F CID ION TORRENT PANEL 1-2 IL7R CHRONIC EBV VIREMIA, URI (recurrent THROMBOCYTOPENIA,SEVERE DERMATITIS, GROWTH RETARDATION, HYPERGAMMAGLOBULINEMIA.

JAGN1 (48), CECR1 (43) and NRAS genes, associated to complex phenotypes, were identified in 12 of the Other PIDs group (25%). 44 (32 Ion Torrent and 12 Haloplex) disease-associated variants have been identified in 30 patients. the majority of variants detected by Ion Torrent were missense (n = 23; 74.2%). the majority of variants detected by Ion Torrent were missense (n = 23; 74.2%). a heterozygous damaging variant in the CTLA4 gene and a predicted damaging variant in the PTEN gene in an adult patient followed since childhood (PID56). the patient inherited one mutation from the father and one from the mother but the real role of these variants and their possible combined effect is still under investigation. heterozygous variants in TNFRSF13B and NOD2 genes were found by Haloplex in three patients. variants in susceptibility genes involved in the disease pathogenesis should be considered for potential future phenotypic implications particularly in adult patients where multiple factors may contribute to the onset of the disease. mutations in agammaglobulinemia are more frequent than expected. this result strengthens the notion of a large phenotypic variety associated with RAG deficiency. this suggests that it should be considered also in patients presenting with an isolated marked B-cell defect. targeted small NGS panels provide an important alternative for clinicians for direct sequencing of relevant genes. extended gene panels or WES should be directly used in these cases for research purposes, to allow the diagnosis of unexpected genotype-phenotype association. this is yet unfeasible for extended diagnostic purposes.
