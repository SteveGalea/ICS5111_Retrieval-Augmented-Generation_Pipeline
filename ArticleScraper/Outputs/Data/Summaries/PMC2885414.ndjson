{"summary": "study was done to determine if serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations correlated with the incidence of acute viral respiratory tract infections. 198 healthy adults were blinded to the nature of the substance being measured over the fall and winter 2009\u20132010. influenza epidemics occur simultaneously at the same latitudes across the globe. there are well-documented seasonal variations in 25-hydroxyvitamin D (vitamin D) concentrations [9]-[11] and documented correlations between those concentrations and latitudes of residence [13], [13]. vitamin D may modulate the production of cytokines, suppressing inflammation [18], and reduce the severity of viral pneumonia [19]. study was undertaken to determine if there is any correlation between the incidence of acute viral respiratory tract infections and serum vitamin D concentrations as measured monthly from September 20, 2009 to January 10, 2010. participants were not excluded if on thyroid or estrogen replacement therapy, oral contraceptives, or if they had mild seasonal allergies. concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D were measured in duplicate by a chemiluminescence immunoassay. the first concentrations were drawn from September 20\u201328, 2009, and then monthly thereafter. investigators on site were blinded to the coded results. all data was entered into a secure web-accessible database (MARVI) all participants presenting with acute symptoms of a respiratory tract infection had a nasopharyngeal swab obtained and placed in viral transport media (M4, Remel, Lenexa, KS) these specimens were tested within 24 hours of collection at the Clinical Virology Laboratory at the Yale New Haven Hospital. the initial serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were examined with respect to the onset of respiratory tract viral infections seen over the entire study period. a non-linear pharmacodynamic concentration-response model was constructed, with parameters estimated by minimizing the log likelihood. participants were stratified into two groups by presence or absence of an infectious event. a semi-parametric Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine if participants stratified by high or low vitamin D concentrations were less likely to develop an acute viral respiratory tract infection. participants who did not complete the study were right-censored to the time the study ended. participants were not excluded if on thyroid or estrogen replacement therapy, oral contraceptives, or if they had mild seasonal allergies. participants agreed to donate one tube (7.5 cc of blood monthly, starting in the third week of September 2009, for 4\u20135 months, depending on an interim analysis after the third blood draw. clinical evaluation Participants reporting any symptoms were seen the same day at the study site by one of the two board-certified Infectious Diseases investigators (JRS, RJC) participants kept a diary of symptoms and were called every 1\u20133 days during the illness to review any signs or symptoms until asymptomatic. cytospin-enhanced direct immunofluorescence (DFA) for adenovirus, parainfluenza types 1,2,3, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza A and B. at the end of the study, DFA-negative specimens that had been frozen at 70\u00b0C were assayed by RT-PCR for the predominant viruses known to be circulating during the study period. initial serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were examined with respect to onset of respiratory tract viral infections seen over the entire study period. a non-linear pharmacodynamic concentration-response model was constructed, with parameters estimated by minimizing the log likelihood. a semi-parametric Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine if participants stratified by high or low vitamin D concentrations were less likely to develop. participants who did not complete the study or who did not experience an event were right-censored to the time the study ended. the regression parameters for the Cox model were estimated using the Breslow likelihood method. the two groups were then examined in an analysis for differences in sex, age, skin pigmentation, use of herbals and supplements. 85 men and 113 women, with an age range of 20\u201388, were enrolled in the study. one participant withdrew from the study days after the first blood draw. 197 were followed for the first period, and 195 for the remainder of the study. serum vitamin D concentrations were measured in the first observation period. only skin pigmentation, vitamin D dose, and body mass index (BMI) were related to serum vitamin D concentrations. a vitamin D concentration of 38 ng/ml best discriminated between groups that did or did not develop viral infections of the respiratory tract. the pharmacodynamic model relating 25-hydroxyvitamin D to length of time to viral infection related to initial serum concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D. b0 = 4.29 (3.50\u20134.96), 0.001;

for participants with concentrations 38 ng/ml, the median duration was also 6 days (100 infections, range 2\u201327 days) of the other180 participants, there were 32 (17.8%) laboratory-confirmed cases. the study had a low power to detect a difference in the incidence of laboratory-confirmed infections in the two 25-hydroxyvitamin D groups (p = 0.0978, by bootstrap analysis with >100,000 trials) all participants N = 198 28.40.8 (2.0\u201373.7) N = 197 27.00.8 (2.0\u201373.0) N = 195 24.60.8 (2.0\u201356.2) N = 195 25.60.8 (4.3\u201360.4) Female N = 113 29.41.1 (2.0\u201365.6) N = 112 28.11.0 (2.0\u201359.5) N = 111 26.51.1 (2.0\u201356.2) N = 111 27.41.1 (4.3\u201360.4) Male N a new tab Predicted from the equation [serum vitamin D ng/ml] = [427.4(1+pigmentation grade)0.5+(dose IU/day) 0.5]/Body mass index, where body mass index = (weight lbs)(703)/height inches)2. the observed concentrations were from the first observation period. curves are fitted 0.1, 0.5 and 0.9 quantiles as function of the regressor. for the individuals who developed viral infections the mean age was 46.9 years. the other points represent individuals who did not develop viral infections. 114 censorings (15 without infection in the 38 ng/ml group, 99 in the 38 ng/ml group, and 3 lost to follow-up) the parameter estimate for 25-hydroxyvitamin D38 ng/ml was 0.66 (1.36\u20140.17) 95% CI and the risk ratio 0.51 (0.25 to 0.84) 95% CI (p0.0001). 174 18 180 Male/Female 10/22 75/91 1 6/17 79/96 1 3/21 82/92 0.016 2/16 83/97 0.048 Light pigmentation 32 122 0.003 23 131 0.028 24 130 0.028 18 136 0.147 Intermediate pigmentation 0 32 0.031 0 32 0.296 0 32 0.166 0 32 0.487 Dark pigmentation 0 12 1 0 12 1 0 12 1 0 12 1 38 ng/ml group was 4.9 times lower; however, a precise multiple could not be determined. unless the duration of illness in the group with the higher 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations was longer than in the other group, the 2.7 fold reduction in incidence would have to reduce the percentages of days ill by at least that factor in the higher group. p = 0.0150 19763 777 (3.9%) a Bootstrap p-values and confidence intervals (CI) over 100,000 trials. duration of illness For participants with 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations 38 ng/ml, the median duration was 6 days (3 infections, range 2\u20138 days); for participants with concentrations 38 ng/ml, the median duration was also 6 days. a serum concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D of 38 ng/ml or higher was associated with a two-fold decrease (p0.0001) in the risk of developing acute viral infections of the respiratory tract. for three consecutive periods and for the whole study the incidences of infection for the group with 25-hydroxyvitamin D38 ng/ml were significantly lower. the 18 participants who were able to maintain 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration 38 ng/ml all had light skin pigmentation and 72.2% were on vitamin D supplementation. the data suggested that there is a non-linear response in dose of vitamin D to serum concentration, which may be related to suggestions of increased metabolism of the vitamin. the results of this study cannot be assumed to apply to other settings, but do call for other studies to determine if vitamin D concentrations have an effect on the following. this study demonstrated a beneficial effect of a serum concentration of vitamin D (38 ng/ml) only slightly higher than the concentration (30 ng/ml) currently believed to represent sufficiency. 1 billion people worldwide have vitamin D concentrations under 30 ng/ml. a much larger number would be expected to have concentrations under 38 ng/ml. average adult has 2\u20133 viral respiratory tract infections each year."}
