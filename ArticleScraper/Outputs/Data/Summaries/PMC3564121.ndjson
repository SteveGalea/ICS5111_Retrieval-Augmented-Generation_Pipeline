{"summary": "Coronavirus replication requires the production of negative-strand RNA from which positive-strand RNA is produced. the two largest open reading frames encode polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab which are cleaved by self-encoded proteases. the proteins upstream of the frameshift signal include predicted proteases and other uncharacterized proteins. the tRNAs positioned on the slippery site uncouple from the mRNA. the second stem of the stimulatory pseudoknot is formed by the distal 3\u2019 sequence base-pairing with residues in the loop region of the first stem loop. the function of this structure, called stem 3, is unknown. es, such as human coronavirus 229E, use a three stemmed pseudoknot. others have an \u2018elaborated pseudoknot\u2019 or kissing stem-loops. avian infectious bronchitis virus uses a two stemmed pseudoknot. periments were designed to test the effects of changes to the length of stem 3 while maintaining a stable structure. first, the loop capping stem 3 was replaced with a shorter tetraloop; the tetra construct contains ten paired bases and a four residue loop. this was used as the basis for construction of two additional tetraloop constructs with shorter stem 3 structures. mutagenesis was used to replace the wild-type loop 2 with a CUUG tetraloop (L2Tetra) additional truncations to stem3 were made. frameshifting efficiency is expressed as a percentage with standard error as described in the experimental section. removing both bulged adenosines (S2S3) from the wild-type backbone decreased rates of frameshifting by 93% (15.3 versus 1.06%, p = 1.7 1018), similar to that observed with the removal of the stem 2 bulge alone. however, the actual sequence of loop 2 or the tetraloop-capping stem 3 also affected frameshifting efficiency. site directed mutagenesis used to change loop2 of the wild-type SARS pseudoknot into tetraloop (L2Tetra from Figure 1). both bulged adenosines were removed by site directed mutagenesis singly or together in conjunction with the tetraloop. the integrity of the second stem, and hence the pseudoknot, is required for efficient frameshifting. a control plasmid, L2-UCC, with a synonymous mutation in loop 2 was also made. a moderate change in frameshifting efficiency was observed. the position of the stems is indicated on the gel. the changes for S2S3 are indicated on the left and the changes to S3D are indicated on the right of the gel. in the S3D construct, Stem-3 base-pairing was disrupted. structure of the pseudoknot shown by diminished reactivity to NMIA at and around the mutated bases in the loop (L2) compared to the wild-type structure (Figure 3B). reactivity with some bases in stem 3 and in the loops L1 and L3 was decreased with some bases in stem 3 and in the loops L1 and L3. RNA was extracted from the infected cell lysate, amplified by RT-PCR and sequenced to confirm that the desired mutations were present. the virus was viable but replicates to a lower titer than the wild type. mutations to stem 3 can affect virus infectivity and replication. TCID50 values were calculated as described in the Experimental Section. the error is the standard deviation of six measurements. the RT-PCR analysis demonstrates that the genomic RNA (gRNA) of L2-UCC accumulates to wild-type levels four days post-infection. the gRNA levels differ by several logs. the stabilization of L2-UCC stem 3 structure and loss of S3D stem 3 structure also support the idea that this region may contain a packaging signal. changes in stem 2 reduced frameshifting to levels similar to those observed with the complete disruption of stem 2 [9]. however, altering the bulged adenosine in stem 2 or disruption of stem 3 promoted only modest changes in frameshifting. all of the truncated structures promoted frameshifting at levels equal to or greater than the wild-type pseudoknot structure. the difference in the tetraloop contributed to the slight increase in frameshifting efficiency. the length of stem 3 does not play a critical role in frameshifting. the bulged adenosine in stem 2 (L2TetraS2) reduced frameshifting by 84.2% (17.5% versus 2.77%, p = 9.3 1019, Figure 2). removal of both adenosines (L2TetraS2S3) partially restored frameshifting with only a 28.2% reduction in frameshifting. stabilizing stem 3 with a tetraloop preserves -1 PRF efficiency. both bulged adenosines were removed from the wild-type pseudoknot (S2S3). mutations in stem 3 have less impact on frameshifting efficiency than mutations in stem 2 [9,11,12]. a negative control plasmid was constructed in which Stem 2 base-pairing was disrupted by mutating three residues in the third codon position. a control plasmid, L2-UCC, with a synonymous mutation in loop 2 was also made. the efficiency of frameshifting as determined by dual luciferase assay is expressed as a percentage below each mutant with standard error shown. an autoradiograph of the primer extension for the wild-type and L2-UCC pseudoknots is shown on the left side of the gel. these moderate changes are similar to the L2-UCC mutant and those observed for other stem 3 mutants. this is the lowest level of frameshifting previously observed for a viable SARS coronavirus. the negative control S2D did not form apseudoknot-like structure. reactivity in the 5\u2019 proximal end of stem 3 and the 3\u2019 portion of loop 2 differed from that seen for S2S3 in which reactivity was more clustered in the 5\u2019 portion of loop 2 and adjacent stem 3 nucleotides. the native structure of loop 2 and correct formation of stem 3 is dependent on the presence of the bulged adenosines. sterisks indicate values that were at the lower limit of the assay. taqman analysis was used to determine the total number of genomic and subgenomic RNA molecules compared to a reference RNA transcribed from a reference RNA. viruses with mutated slippery sites implicating a broader region of this part of the genome as being involved in regulation of transcription. the changes in the previous report resulted in an altered protein sequence, but it is unknown if the pseudoknot structure in the slippery site mutants was affected. the differences are due to RNA sequence and/or structural changes. mutations were confirmed by sequence analyses. mutagenesis was performed using Stratagene\u2019s QuikChange II kit. each mutant subclone was assembled with the other five subclones. SHAPE analysis uses N-methylisatoic anhydride (NMIA) which tests the local backbone flexibility of RNA. more flexible nucleotides assume conformations that are reactive to NMIA which irreversibly acylates the ribose 2\u2019-hydroxyl groups. this then presents as a stop upstream of the modified base. RNA was precipitated with 90 L H2O, 4 L 5M NaCl, 1 L 20 mg/mL glycogen, 2 L 100 mM EDTA pH 8.0, and 350 L ethanol overnight at 80oC. the oligonucleotide 5'-GCCGGGCCTTTCTTTATG-3' was labeled with 30 Ci gamma 32 P-adenosine triphosphate (ATP) using T4 kinase. at least three replicates were performed within each assay. the frequency of frameshifting is expressed as a ratio of firefly to Renilla luciferase from a test plasmid divided by the analogous ratio from the read-through control plasmid multiplied by 100%. the RNA polymerase is translated as a readthrough product. the internal replication element is downstream of the readthrough signal. a less structured stem 3 in the frameshift pseudoknot led to significantly reduced amounts of gRNA compared to viruses with more structured pseudoknots. coronavirus RNA synthesis involves structurally and functionally separable RNA synthesising complexes. the nsp7+nsp8 complex from three different coronaviruses has recently been shown to have primer-independent RNA polymerase activity [33,34] te Velthuis and colleagues suggested that the separate RdRPs may influence plus and minus strand synthesis. genomic RNA was reduced to 10-fold lower levels than the subgenomic RNA. it is not clear if this result is due to a change in the abundance of gRNA available to be transcribed to sgRNA or if it is attributable to other factors, such as interactions between the gRNA and other proteins."}
