{"summary": "ribosome translocates mRNA and bound tRNA molecules accurately in order to maintain the reading frame. this process results in movement of the ribosome along the mRNA by three nucleotides toward the mRNA\u2019s 3\u2032-end. mechanistic basis for mRNA helicase activity proposed involving ribosomal proteins S3, S4, S5 at the mRNA entrance and rotational movement of the head of the 30 S subunit. possible effects of such tension were directly observed in the cryo-electron microscopic (Cryo-EM) images of eukaryotic ribosomes stalled in the process of \u20131 frameshifting in complex with eEF2, tRNA and a frame RNA folds as a pseudoknot (28,29); a pseudoknot with an RNA triple helix motif (30) and two-stem helix containing a three-purine bulge (8). two independent nuclear magnetic resonance studies have shown that in the absence of the ribosome, the fold is a long hairpin (Figure 1) with an internal three-nucleotide bulge (9,10). optical tweezers aid in applying forces locally to a folded RNA molecule in a way that may be more similar to in vivo conditions than thermal or chemical denaturing. in the case of a hairpin, the mechanical force will act locally on the 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-ends of the RNA unzipping the stem base-pair by base-pair toward the loop. mRNA (1 M) was annealed to primer (2 M) in 50 mM K-Hepes (pH 7.0) and 100 mM KCl. to form the complexes, tight-couple ribosomes were added to 0.6 M of mRNA in 60 mM NH4Cl, 10 mM Tris\u2013Acetate (pH 7.4) and 20 mM MgCl2. aliquots (0.6 pmol mRNA) were removed from each reaction lacking (\u2013G) or containing (+G) EF-G. each reaction was extended in parallel (38) with (5\u2032-CTTTATCTTCAGAGAAAAAAAACC-3\u2032) primer. stepwise translocation Stepwise translocation experiments were done as previously described (15) mRNA binding was performed by incubating 70 S ribosome in 50 l reaction buffer A (20 mM MgCl2, 150 mM NH4Cl, 80 mM potassium cacodylate, pH 7.2) for 10 min. mRNA\u2013tRNA\u201370 S complexes were then purified by ultrafiltration (MICROCON YM-100 100 000 Da, Fisher scientific LABOSI) pGENE32 is pUC118 containing a region of phage T4 gene 32 (40) downstream of an engineered T7 promoter sequence. transcripts with stem\u2013loop were obtained by in vitro transcription of synthetic genes flanked upstream by T7 RNA polymerase promoter region and downstream by a BamHI restriction site. handle A (pBR322 bases 3821 to 3) was biotinylated, and one of the primers used to amplify handle B was purchased with a 5\u2032 digoxigenin group. five microliters of anti-digoxigenin-coated polystyrene beads (0.3 nM; diam. 0.49 m) were mixed with 1 l of the DNA\u2013RNA hybrid (1 M) in binding buffer. molecules were stretched in 10 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.0), 250 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2 or alternatively in 10 mM Tris\u2013acetate (pH 7.4), 60 mM NH4Cl, 6 mM -mercapto, 20 mM MgCl2. unfolding/refolding parameters were statistically indistinguishable for both conditions. mRNA (1 M) was annealed to primer (2 M) in 50 mM K-Hepes (pH 7.0) and 100 mM KCl by heating to 90\u00b0C for 1 min. tight-couple ribosomes (2\u20135 M) (37) from E. coli MRE600 were added to 0.6 M of mRNA in 60 mM NH4Cl, 10 mM Tris\u2013Acetate (pH 7.4) and 20 aliquots were added to separate tubes containing either GTP (600 M) (F), GTP + tRNALeu, EF-G (1 M) (L), GTP + tRNALeu, EF-G + tRNAGly (1 M) (G), GTP + tRNALeu, EF-G + tRNAGly (1 M) (K), GTP + tRNALeu, EF-G + tRNAGly + tRNA mRNA (10\u201350 pmol according to the mRNA tested) with mRNA (10\u201350 pmol) in 50 l reaction buffer A (20 mM MgCl2, 150 mM NH4Cl, 80 mM potassium cacodylate, pH 7.2) at 37\u00b0C for 10 min. mRNA\u2013tRNA\u201370 S complexes were then purified by ultrafiltration (MICROCON YM-100 100 000 Da, Fisher scientific LAB pGENE32 is pUC118 containing a region of phage T4 gene 32 (40) downstream of an engineered T7 promoter sequence. transcripts with stem\u2013loop were obtained by in vitro transcription of synthetic genes flanked upstream by T7 RNA polymerase promoter region. five microliters of anti-digoxigenin-coated polystyrene beads (0.3 nM; diam. 0.49 m) were mixed with 1 l of the DNA\u2013RNA hybrid (1 M) in binding buffer (10 mM Tris buffer [pH 7.0], 250 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.4% w/v BSA) molecules were stretched in 10 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.0), 250 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, or alternatively in 10 mM Tris\u2013acetate (pH 7.4), 60 mM NH4Cl, 6 mM -mercapto, 20 mM MgCl2. the spring constant of the optical tweezers was 0.1\u20130.2 pN nm\u20131 a primer-extension inhibition assay has been shown to be a powerful tool for mapping the position of mRNA within 30 S and 70 S ribosomal complexes that contain tRNA (45) RT encounters the ribosome (a so-called hard-stop), it terminates cDNA synthesis thereby generating a highly specific toeprint. RT may also stall at mRNA structural elements further downstream from the ribosome that prove too hard for the signal at +15 did decrease, indicating that binding of the tRNALeu at the A site assisted in the positioning of the mRNA with tRNAPhe preferentially bound to the u+1u+2u+3 codon adjacent to the leucine codon u+4u+5a+6. the toeprints at +16, +17 were moved to +20 and +21, corresponding to a 4-nt translocation event. tRNAfMet was bound at the mRNA\u2013ribosome complex followed by stepwise addition of mRNAs mSP-Tyr-SL-HIV-1. when tRNAfMet was bound at the P site, a doublet of toeprints at positions +U16/+G17 was detected. but the signal in presence of ribosome is substantially stronger. the +16 and +17 toeprints are hard stops, independent of the reverse transcription activity. mRNA interactions with the ribosome can extend beyond the usual 15 nucleotides buried in the ribosome-mRNA track (48,50) the intensities of both toeprint signals decreased (Figure 2B) and were reproducibly of lower level than the RT stops found in the control lane \u201370 S. the substitution of the purines in the bulge by pyrimidines also decreases frameshifting efficiency (8,32) tRNAGly (lane G) and tRNALys (lane K) in presence of EF-G did not further affect the position of the extended toeprint, which remained at +39. the toeprints at the new positions A+16/U+17 were unambiguously identified. the +19 toeprint remains the strongest toeprint in the upper region of the gel. mSP-SL-HIV-1 mRNA complexed with 70 S ribosome\u2013tRNA complexes is positioned with the slippery sequence at the decoding site. nucleotides with modified reactivity are highlighted with a square. mSP-SL-HIV-1 mRNA was probed in complex with the ribosome and tRNA. base A+1, of the methionine codon, is protected from chemical modifications. individual hairpins sandwiched between two differentially end-labeled hybrid DNA\u2013RNA handles were unfolded using optical tweezers (42). Molecules were tethered between a streptavidin-coated glass cover slip and anti-digoxygenin coated polystyrene beads (diameter 1 m), and stretched by moving the piezo-actuated microscope stage while holding the bead with optical tweezers (42). 4 and S5 yield a decrease of contour length of 26.0 4.7 nm (mean SD) at an average refolding force of 13.1 1.1 pN (mean SD), and G = 11 3 kcal/mol (mean SD) essentially unchanged from the unfolding statistics, as one would expect when at thermal equilibrium. a single position of the tRNA in the A site results in a doublet of bands (at positions +16 and +17) (46,47) binding of the tRNALeu at the A site assisted in the positioning of the mRNA with tRNAPhe preferentially bound to the u+1u+2u+3 codon adjacent to the leucine codon u+4u+5a+6. mSP-SL-HIV-1 contains the mRNA frameshifting signal. we substituted the phenylalanine codon (u+1u+2u+3) for a methionine codon (a+1u+2g+3) to avoid complications due to the presence of the slippery site. this allows tRNA binding in only one unique reading frame. tRNALeu4 was subsequently bound to the A site (Figures S2, lane 3, and 2A, lane M\u2032) which resulted in the disappearance of the +16 toeprint. the toeprints are hard stops, independent of the reverse transcription activity indicating that the mRNA secondary structure unfolds during cDNA synthesis as previously seen for a stem\u2013loop (48) and pseudoknots (49). in order to test the contribution of the bulge region to the extended toeprint, we changed the GGA-bulge by a CCC-bulge (mSP-SL-CCC-HIV-1, Figure 1). the intensities of both toeprint signals (at +43 and +47) decreased (Figure 2B) and were reproducibly of lower level than the RT stops found in the control lane \u201370 S. ribosomes are known to change conformation upon EF-G binding (52\u201355) tRNAGly (lane G) and tRNALys (lane K) in presence of EF-G did not further affect the position of the extended toeprint, which remained at +39, indicating that further movement of the mRNA through the ribosome was impaired. the +19 toeprint remains the strongest toeprint in the upper region of the gel. mSP-SL-HIV-1 mRNA complexed with 70 S ribosome\u2013tRNA complexes. the ribosome is positioned with the slippery sequence at the decoding site. nucleotides with modified reactivity are highlighted with a square. mSP-SL-HIV-1 mRNA was probed in complex with ribosome and tRNA. base A+1, of the methionine codon, is protected from chemical modifications. mechanical unfolding of the HIV-1 RNA hairpin. individual hairpins sandwiched between two differentially end-labeled hybrid DNA\u2013RNA handles were unfolded using optical tweezers (42). velocities were 67 nm/s, so that the system remained at or close to thermodynamic equilibrium. refolding statistics are summarized in the Figures S4 and S5. they yield a decrease of contour length of 26.0 4.7 nm (mean SD) at an average refolding force of 13.1 1.1 pN (mean SD), and G = 11 3 kcal/mol (mean SD), essentially unchanged from the unfolding statistics. mechanical unfolding of free hairpins indicates the lower stem is fairly weak to begin with. if such stabilization was to occur, it does not prevent further translocation. the extended toeprint at +39 remains even under conditions where further translocation is allowed. single-molecule mechanical unfolding experiments in the presence of ribosomes are considered, but beyond the scope of this article. our chemical probing experiments provide further insight into the structure of the HIV-1 frameshift signal when bound to the ribosome. mSP-HIV-1 toeprint at +15 corresponds to tRNAPhe that recognizes the overlapping codon, one nucleotide upstream (u\u20131u+1u+2). overlapping codons u+2u+3u+4 and u+3u+4u+5 are not pairing with tRNAPhe because no toeprints were observed at +17. the toeprint at +19 is the expected signal for a post-translocation complex with tRNALeu in the P site bound at the u+4u+5a+6g+7 codon. however, the major toeprint signal is at position +20 suggesting that in the post-translocation complex the tRNALeu is interacting with the u+5a+6g+7 codon. mSP-HIV-1 and mSP-SL-HIV-1 mRNAs respectively at +16 and +17 fall into this range. we expect a pulling force on the spacer mRNA out of the ribosome purely based on entropic arguments. in the case of the HIV-1 hairpin, physical interactions may provide some sort of strain relieve allowing +16 to slightly relax back into the ribosome. the importance of the lower stem and bulge regions for the \u20131 frameshift (8,32,66) it is possible that this interaction enhances \u20131 frameshifting at the particularly slippery UUUUUUA sequence (67)."}
