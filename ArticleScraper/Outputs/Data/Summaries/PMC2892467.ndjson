{"summary": "increased influenza vaccination coverage for the elderly has prevented influenza-related complications and deaths, based on 64 studies from 1964 to 2006. in Taiwan, elderly populations (aged 65 years) have received free influenza vaccination since 1998. despite similar expansions, pneumonia and influenza (P&I) mortality among the elderly have continued to rise in Italy [3] and the united states [4], [5]. the elderly population was calculated as the average of two mid-years' elderly population. mortality was divided into three categories: pneumonia and influenza (P&I, ICD-9: 480\u2013487) and respiratory and circulatory (R&C, ICD-9: 390\u2013519). -SARS effect for multivariate analyses with a modification of a Thompson-like model [4] because of dispersed distributions of the three influenza-associated mortality rates (variance/mean >20) explanatory variables include monthly meteorological parameters (monthly means of temperature and humidity), annual periodic cycle (i.e., sine/cosine function of seasonal periodicity), monthly virus isolation rates for different subtypes/types of influenza viruses. &I, respiratory and circulatory, and (3) all-cause deaths in Taiwan, from October 1999 to September 2007, respectively.

HA1 amino acid identity percentage was 96.4%. this was a higher identity percentage than in 2003\u20132004. this was a lower identity percentage than in 2004\u201305 (97.1%). minant Strains A/Sydney/5/97-like (H3N2) A/Moscow/10/99-like (H3N2) A/Fujian/411/2002-like (H3N2) A/Wisconsin/67/05-like (H3N2) A/Sydney/05/97 (H3N2) 0.996 0.96* 0.932 0.911 A/Moscow/10/99 (H3N2) was not During the 1999\u20132000 flu season, A/Sydney/05/97(H3N2) and A/Moscow/10/99(H3N2) were the dominant circulating strains affecting Taiwan. A/Sydney/05/97-like was the vaccine strain and provided inadequate protection against A/Moscow/10/99. no variations were found at epitopes C (0/8) or D (0/13). in 2003\u20132004, there were more variations (9/19) at epitope B in circulating and vaccine-mismatched A (H3N2) strains than in the 2004\u20132005 influenza season. there was also a higher winter excess P&I mortality in 2003\u20132004 as compared to in 2004\u20132005. panel A represents prior and during SARS period from October 1999 to September 2007. panel B represents post-SARS period from October 2003 to September 2007. virological Surveillance and Mismatched Vaccine Strains. influenza A (H3N2)'s monthly isolation rate and sine function were positively correlated with R&C deaths. mean temperature and relative humidity were both negatively correlated with R&C deaths. values for observed and estimated deaths were proximate for all three influenza-associated mortality models. vaccine-matched versus vaccine-mismatched strains before and after SARS. in 2002\u20132003 winter, well vaccine-matched influenza strains resulted in 0.45/100,000 excess P&I mortality. mismatched vaccine did show a trend in increased P&I mortalities in those years without post-SARS effect. excess P&I mortality mean in influenza vaccine-mismatched winters in pre-SARS was much higher than the mean in post-SARS winters. post-SARS years showed a trend toward reduced influenza-associated mortality while vaccines were mismatched. four of the eight studied years showed increased winter excess influenza-associated mortalities (3/100,000) plus one higher excess mortality in March, 2005 (5.28/100,000), and five of them had vaccine-mismatches. in 2002\u20132003 winter (during the \u201cpre-SARS\u201d period), well vaccine-matched influenza strains resulted in a monthly mean of 0.45/100,000 excess P&I mortality. vaccine-mismatched winters in pre- and post-SARS winters showed a trend toward reduced influenza-associated mortality while vaccines were mismatched. influenza vaccine-matches during post-SARS winters showed significantly lower excess P&I mortality than vaccine-matched influenza A viruses during pre-SARS winters. the HA1 of Taiwanese influenza A (H3N2) virus in 1999\u20132000 had a HA1 amino acid identity percentage of 96.4%. this was a higher identity percentage than in 2003\u20132004 (93.2%) but a lower identity percentage than in 2004\u201305 (97.1%) influenza B strains of Victoria lineage (B/Malaysia/2506/2004) were shown to be mismatched (89.9% amino acid identity) with vaccine strains of Yamagata lineage (B/Shanghai/361/2002-like) [17],. high excess mortality was therefore observed in March of that year. the A (H3N2) Fujian strain circulated dominantly in 2003 in Taiwan with notably high excess P&I mortality. we compared Taiwan's dominant circulating H3N2 strains with the vaccine H3N2 strains used during 1999\u20132000, 2003\u20132004, and 2004\u20132005. nine of the 19 amino acid differences in HA occurred at epitope B. During the 2004\u20132005 flu season, the dominant A/California/7/2004 (H3N2) strain did not match with the vaccine A/Fujian/411/2002 (H3N2) strain. ismatched influenza viruses associated with excess mortality. higher A (H3N2) subtype isolation rates were associated with increased influenza-associated mortality. lower P&I mortality rates were observed when circulating strains of influenza viruses were vaccine-matched. vaccine-mismatched influenza viruses appeared prior to the introduction of WHO's recommended vaccine strain [22]. the mismatched A (H3N2) Fujian strain appeared in 2002 and circulated for several months. the mismatched A (H3N2) Fujian strain appeared in 2002 and circulated for several months. antigenic differences need to be identified efficiently by serological testing for isolated influenza viruses with high monthly/weekly excess P&I mortality. from January 2001\u2013October 2001, documented vaccine effectiveness (VE) was 53% for preventing pneumonia deaths (when B was mismatched) and 44% for preventing all-cause deaths among the elderly in Taiwan [24]. able change that occurred following the SARS outbreak was the peaking of Taiwan's elderly influenza vaccine coverage rate at 68.4% in 2003\u20132004. these changes, in combination with increasing awareness of infectious diseases among physicians, may have contributed to the sustained post-SARS effect that we propose had a significant impact on Taiwan's elderly P&I mortality rates. three studies in Taiwan [36], in Wuhan City of Hubei Province in mainland China [30] and in Hong Kong [31] support the claim that public health this study has five major limitations: first, Taiwan's monthly influenza virus isolation rates prior to 1999 were not comprehensive. second, weekly and monthly matching statuses were not available. the benefit of vaccination may be underestimated because older elderly populations are at higher risk of developing severe complications and deaths. the major limitation of this study was a lack of long-term data that prevents us from drawing definitive conclusions. we have illustrated possible associations between the observed reduction in P&I mortality and vaccine match on the one hand, and the post-SARS effect on the other hand. international collaboration on an integrated clinical, epidemiological, and virological influenza surveillance system will be necessary to monitor for potential increases in clinical severity. figures show isolation rates of human influenza viruses in Taiwan from October 1999 to September 2007.
