{"summary": "glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is the most common enzymopathy in humans, affecting 400 million people worldwide. glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is the most common enzymopathy in humans. type I IFNs are the principal antiviral cytokines produced during the innate immune responses to viral infections. more than 300 IFN-stimulated genes have been discovered. some ISG-encoded proteins, such as GTPase myxovirus resistance 1 (MX1) [23], protein kinase R (24], and 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) [25], are implicated in the antivir HSCARG suppresses the TNF--stimulated activation of NF-B. HSCARG can inhibit TRAF3 ubiquitination and negatively regulate the cellular antiviral response. examining the relationship between the G6PD status and host immune response is worthwhile. -actin, anti-HSCARG, antihorseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antimouse IgG, and antirabbit IgG were purchased from Dharmacon RNA Technologies.

RNA was harvested from HCoV 229E-infected cells at indicated time points p.i.. mX1 gene expression was determined by quantitative-PCR. values represent average SD of three experiments. the level of induction was also reduced by 40% at 2 h p.i and by 28% at 8 h p.i in the A549-Gi cells. the difference in inducibility of antiviral genes in control versus G6PD-deficient cells was observed in the case of EV71 infection. expression of TNF- and MX1 genes in G6PD-knockdown RD-Gi cells was significantly lower than in RD-Sc cells. 1.17 0.15 1.43 0.27 0.86 0.29 1.81 0.35 504.07 42.68 OAS 1 1.77 0.32 5.49 0.22 9.73 0.42 11.64 2.53 15.16 2.15 27.1 1.25 PKR 1 8.99 2.94 7.45 1.48 7.96 1.51 8.08 1.46 7.47 1.54 8.72 1.97 MX1 1 123.69 1.09 522.69 50.95 736.82 194.12 1390.95 65.63 2381.91 TNF- Knockdown Enhances Viral Replication in A549 Cells TNF- is implicated in the modulation of the viral life cycle and the regulation of antiviral gene expression. the reduced inducibility in G6PD-deficient cells may account for the increase in the viral replication of these cells. the effect of the G6PD status on the expression of the TNF- and MX1 genes may be due to differences between the transcriptional levels of G6PD-knockdown and control cells. the transfected cells were assayed for luciferase activity after infection with HCoV-229E. binding activity of NF-B increased in the A549-Sc cells upon HCoV-229E infection, reaching the maximum level at 60 min p.i. and decreasing afterwards. binding activity of NF-B was higher in the A549-Sc cells than in the A549-Gi cells. BAY 11-7085 significantly reduced the induction of the TNF- and MX1 genes. little is known about the role of NF-B in MX1 promoter regulation. three ISREs and one NF-B (234 to 244) binding site are indicated with labeled boxes. a MX1 promoter region devoid of NF-B binding site (244 to 235) was engineered as described in Materials and Methods. the level of HSCARG protein was higher in the A549-Gi cells than in the A549-Sc cells. these results suggest that the G6PD status is involved in the regulation of HSCARG expression, thereby affecting NF-B signaling and antiviral response. the HSCARG-specific and nontargeting-siRNA-treated cells were infected with HCoV-229E (at a MOI of 0.1) the NF-B binding activity was enhanced in the HSCARG-specific, siRNA-treated cells. the effect of the siRNA treatment on the temporal change of the expression of the TNF- and MX1 genes were studied in the infected cells. NF-\u00eaB binding activity was analyzed by densitometric scanning. values represent average SD of five independent experiments. total RNA was harvested at indicated time points p.i.. expression of NF- and MX1 gene augments antiviral gene expression in HCoV-229E-infected A549-Gi cells. expression of G6PD or IDH1 gene augments antiviral gene expression in HCoV-229E-infected cells. A549-Gi cells were infected with a retroviral vector expressing G6PD-specific (Gi) and Sc shRNA. expression of G6PD was significantly reduced in A549-Gi cells compared with the A549-Sc cells. -Actin was used as internal control. A549-Sc and -Gi cells were infected with HCoV-229E (0.1 MOI) for 24 h. the level of induction level was considerably lower in the A549-Gi cells. expression of the MX1 gene increased during the infection course of HCoV-229E. level of induction was reduced by 40% at 2 h p.i. and by 28% at 8 h p.i in the A549-Gi cells. 10 h 24 h A549 HCoV 229E N gene N.D. 1 5.08 1.30 20.92 6.45 102.73 15.24 946.55 83.16 5566.24 312.68 TNF- 1 432.58 23.35 71.32 0.41 27.05 0.89 8.39 1.29 7.71 0.75 236.52 33.27 IFN- 1 0.89 0.11 1.76 0.83 1.29 0.43 2.30 1.14 1.90 0.87 IFN- 1 0.78 0.20 0.93 0.32 1.39 0.54 0.79 0.52 1.63 0.24 0.88 0.43 IFN- 1 0.92 0.02 0.89 0.12 0.98 0.29 0.84 0.05 1.23 0.92 1194.91 36.47 OAS 1 11.27 1.33 93.33 0.41 289.97 27.38 521.57 170.79 997.31 182.12 4775.85 620.45 PKR 1 4.10 1.84 4.18 1.69 5.16 a549 cells were treated with control or TNF- siRNA for 24 h. the cells were challenged with different concentration of TNF-\u00e1. total RNA was harvested for analyzing viral N gene expression. promoter activities of antiviral genes, TNF- and MX1, and NF-B binding activity is highly correlated with G6PD status upon HCoV 229E infection. the binding activity of NF-B increased in the A549-Sc cells upon HCoV-229E infection, reaching the maximum level at 60 min p.i. and decreasing afterwards. the binding activity of NF-B was higher in the A549-Sc cells than in the A549-Gi cells. HCoV-229E induced significant induction of the MX1P luciferase construct. NF-B plays a crucial role in the transcriptional regulation of the MX1 gene. the promoter activity of MX1 gene can be modulated by NF-B. HSCARG was proposed as a cellular redox sensor of the NADPH/NADP+ ratio. the finding revealed a significantly lower NADPH/NADP+ ratio in A549-Gi cells compared with A549-Sc cells. this increases the possibility that HSCARG is involved in the regulation of NF-B signaling. change in HSCARG protein level is shown as compared to a549-Sc cells. HSCARG-specific siRNA treatment caused a significant reduction in the level of HSCARG mRNA. the HSCARG-specific and nontargeting-siRNA-treated cells were infected with HCoV-229E. HSCARG-knockdown increases antiviral response and decreases viral replication. total RNA was collected at 48 h after transfection. levels of HSCARG was expressed relative to that of A549-Gi cells transfected with control-siRNA. expression of G6PD or IDH1 in the A549-Gi cells led to diminished expression of the HSCARG transcript. exogenous G6PD expression led to an increase in TNF- and MX1 gene expression upon HCoV-229E infection. this was accompanied by decreased viral N gene expression. cells were transfected with expression construct encoding His-tagged G6PD or IDH1. total RNA was harvested for determination of expression level of TNF- (at 2 h post-infection) (D); MX1 (at 8 h post-infection) (E) and viral gene (at 8 h post-infection) (F) by quantitative-PCR. the increased susceptibility to viral infections may be partly due to the impaired immune response of G6PD-knockdown cells. the expression of cytokine genes (such as IFN-/ and TNF-) and antiviral genes (such as IFN-stimulated genes) increases in A549 and MRC-5 cells upon HCoV-229E infection, and increases in RD cells upon EV71 infection. infection of cells with HCoV-229E results in degradation and increases NF-B binding. NF-B activation is sensitive to cellular redox changes; NF-B is normally activated under oxidative stress. treatment with HSCARG siRNA increases antiviral response. HSCARG suppresses NF-B activity via modulation of IB phosphorylation/degradation, leading to reduction in expression of antiviral genes such as TNF- and MX1. redox status may regulate antiviral response and viral replication via the HSCARG-NF-B signaling pathway. generation and G6PD activity has been observed in such pathophysiological situations as liver hypertrophy [68] and cardiovascular dysfunction [69]. Similarly, nitric oxide production can be affected [70]. the interplay between antioxidative and pro-oxidative roles of G6PD may be complicated."}
