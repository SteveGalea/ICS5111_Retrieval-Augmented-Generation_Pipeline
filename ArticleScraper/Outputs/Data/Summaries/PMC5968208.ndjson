{"summary": "asymptomatic infection rate was 0.060% (95% confidence interval, 0.002 to 0.346) MERS is a severe respiratory infection caused by a novel beta coronavirus. symptoms include fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, gastrointestinal symptoms, hemoptysis, sore throat, headache, myalgia, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea. the rates of asymptomatic or mild infection were 44 of 398 (28.60%) in Saudi Arabia, the united arab Emirates, and the Islamic Republic of Iran between April and June 2014. among the 186 confirmed cases, 3 asymptomatic cases were detected among healthcare workers via screening tests (1.61%) from the 14,831 quarantined individuals, 7,233 residents (48.8%) living in the 4 major MERS outbreak regions were selected. a total of 1,610 individuals (48.9%) ultimately participated in the study.

PRNT is a definitive test when ELISA and IFA have inconclusive results. only 10% of ELISA-positive results are positive on a neutralization assay. a previous study predicted the pandemic potential of MERS-CoV to be 5%. the antibody response was highest after 3 weeks from symptom onset. a recent study of severe acute respiratory syndrome and MERS reported that antibodies in some patients persisted for 2-3 years after infection."}
