{"summary": "in coronaviruses, genomic 5\u2032-end-proximal RNA structures carry out several functions required for virus reproduction. these include (i) translation initiation, commonly presumed to occur by a canonical cap-dependent 5\u2032-terminal ribosomal entry mechanism, to synthesize the replicase enzymes from open reading frame 1 (13, 14, 31) the hatched box identifies a potential long-range interaction. the subscript for each mutation indicates its incidence among the 17 isolates. the number of base pairs within the window is 19, not 27 (as in MHV) or 25 (as in BCoV) chimeric virus replicated for at least three passages without compensatory suppressor mutations appearing within the 5\u2032-most 1,000 nt and 3\u2032-most 500 nt of the genome. a 30-nt inter-stem-loop domain in the MHV 5\u2032 UTR that resides between SLIII and SLIV (nt 141 to 170) could not be replaced by the 32-nt BCoV counterpart (nt 142 to 173). the resulting chimera, B142-173/M, produced plaques and viable progeny after two blind cell passages in one of four experimental attempts. we describe seven potential suppressor mutations that appeared within the transplanted 32-nt BCoV inter-stem-loop domain. five within a 32-nt partnering domain mapping 200 nt downstream within the Nsp1 coding region. geneBank accession numbers for virus sequences analyzed are as follows: NC_001846 for MHV-A59; NC_006852 for MHV-JHM; NC_012936 for Parker rat CoV; NC_006577 for human coronavirus (HCoV)-HKU1; NC_010327 for equine coronavirus (ECoV); FJ415324 for human enteric coronavirus-4408; U007 proximal BCoV/MHV chimeras in MHV-A59 background (22) mutations were made by modifying fragment A of MHV-A59. all procedures for plasmid construction with icMHV DNA, expression of recombinant viral RNA, transfection of cells with infectious recombinant RNA by electroporation were carried out as previously described. cellular RNA was reverse transcribed with superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) using primer MHV-1094(+) (5\u2032CGATCAACGTGCCAAGCCACAAGG3\u2032), which binds nt 1 to 21 of the MHV antileader. cDNA was PCR amplified with primer MHV(30811\u201330830) freshly confluent DBT cells in 25-cm2 flasks (4 106 cells) were infected with wt or chimeric viruses. at 20 h postinfection, intracellular RNA was TRIzol extracted. 1/10 of the total RNA from one 25-cm2 flask was resolved by electrophoresis in a 1.0% agarose-formaldehyde gel. cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for all experiments. geneBank accession numbers for virus sequences are as follows: NC_001846 for MHV-A59; NC_006852 for MHV-JHM; NC_012936 for Parker rat CoV. recombinant viruses described here were made by modifying fragment A of MHV-A59 as reported previously (22). all procedures for plasmid construction with icMHV DNA, expression of recombinant viral RNA, transfection of cells with infectious recombinant RNA by electroporation, and characterization of mutant progeny by virus titration and growth kinetics were carried out as previously described (22). cellular RNA was reverse transcribed with superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) for analysis of the 5\u2032 nt 22 to 1093 of progeny virus genomes. cDNA was PCR amplified with primers MHV-leader() (5\u2032TATAAGAGTGATTGGCGTCCG3\u2032) gel-purified PCR products were sequenced with primer MHV(30811\u201330830)(). freshly confluent DBT cells in 25-cm2 flasks (4 106 cells) were infected with wt or chimeric viruses at an MOI of 0.01 PFU/cell. at 20 h postinfection, intracellular RNA was TRIzol extracted. 1/10 of the total RNA from one 25-cm2 flask was resolved nucleotides 131 to 140, the 5\u2032-terminal 10 nt of the entire sequence between SLIII and SLIV, were not included as part of the transplanted 32-nt inter-stem-loop domain. chimeric RNA containing the 32-nt transplanted BCoV domain was found to yield no viable progeny after four blind cell passages. no 3\u2032-end-proximal changes were found, and nucleotide changes within the 5\u2032-end-proximal nt 22 through 1093 are summarized in Table 1. Fig 2. Phenotypes of representative plaque-purified progeny from cells electroporated with chimeric B142\u2013173/M RNA. there were fewer predicted base pairings initially between the two regions in B142\u2013173/M RNA (19 bp) than in Mfold-predicted wt MHV RNA (27 bp) the number of base pairs within the window increased from 19 (Fig. 1C and 3A) to 22 to 25 (Table 1 and 3B) any of the three potential foldings can accommodate revertants S2, L2, L3, L5, L6, L7, L8, and L11, and others are accommodated as indicated. base pairings within the base-pairing window increased from 19 to 22, 23, 24, or 25 (as described in Table 1). shaded areas identify regions of base pairing common to the whole group. the number of base pairings within the inter-stem-loop domain for any given virus ranges from 25 to 27. wt MHV-A59 and wt-MHV-infected cells (lane 2) developed large plaques. wt MHV-A59 and wt-MHV-infected cells (lane 2) developed large plaques. a 10-fold-lower final titer showed a wt-like sgmRNA profile. the mutations A353U and A363G were separately placed into the MHV genome along with the wt BCoV inter-stem-loop domain and tested. with B142\u2013173,A353U/M RNA, CPE appeared within 48 hpt and VP0 virus generated wt-like plaques, retained the A353U mutation, and also contained G169U within the transplanted domain. these results show that the single potential suppressor mutations a virus species-specific interaction between the inter-stem-loop domain in the 5\u2032 UTR and its partnering domain in the Nsp1 coding region is required for virus replication. a chimera was tested in which the entire MHV 5\u2032 UTR plus its 16-nt extension into its Nsp1 coding region was used with the adapted BCoV Nsp1 coding region to form B227\u2013906/M. construct in which the BCoV 5\u2032 UTR containing the 30-nt MHV inter-stem-loop domain was tested in the MHV background as in B1-141,174-226/M. progeny from electroporated RNA (VP0) yielded medium plaques, a peak titer of 1.0 106 PFU/ml, and a full set of viral sgmRNAs. this construct also demonstrated a compatibility requirement the in-frame C-terminal fusion site for the Nsp1 coding region occurs between BCoV nt 906 and MHV nt 909. the titer of progeny was 100-fold lower than that for wt MHV. the titer of progeny was 100-fold lower than that for wt MHV. the 30-nt inter-stem-loop domain in the 5\u2032 UTR is not an absolute requirement for MHV replication in cell culture. a large region of the 3\u2032 UTR has been shown to be dispensable for virus replication in cell culture (20, 22, 50) this test was applied to the 30-nt inter-stem-loop domain in MHV. the MHV 5\u2032 UTR was inserted with a deleted inter-stem-loop region (141\u2013170) and the inserted UCUAA element. the insertion could theoretically have occurred following nt 59, 64, or 69 (illustrated as the latter) a mixture of small and wt-like large plaques were found after two blind cell passages. from this, six small plaques and 11 large plaques were selected. each was passaged 10 times in DBT cells. the most striking result was a clustering of potential suppressor mutations within the transplanted 32-nt BCoV domain. it was also striking that there were fewer predicted base pairings initially between the two regions in B142\u2013173/M RNA (19 bp) than in Mfold-predicted wt MHV RNA (27 bp) base positions (in parentheses) for the BCoV sequence (lowercase) use BCoV numbering. subscript numbers indicate number of occurrences in 17 total isolates. the number of base pairings within the inter-stem-loop domain for any given virus ranges from 25 to 27. phylogenetic covariation of sequences that maintain base pairings within the 30- to 32-nt window. base-pairing between the inter-stem-loop and the Nsp1 partnering domains imparts fitness to the debilitated chimera, C158G, A163U, and G169U. chimera B142\u2013173,S1/M required two blind cell passages before the appearance of CPE (Fig. 2A), B142\u2013173,S1/M developed CPE within 24 h posttransfection. the radiolabeled probe was an oligonucleotide complementary to a 26-nt region within the MHV 3\u2032 UTR. these results are consistent with the hypothesis that base pairing between the inter-stem-loop domain and the Nsp1 coding domain contributes to the replicating ability and fitness of MHV in cell culture. preplaced suppressor mutations within the Nsp1 coding region of the otherwise B142\u2013173/M chimeric RNA single potential suppressor mutations occurring outside the long-range base-pairing windows were not tested as suppressors (Table 1). when the C30U mutation alone was transplanted along with the BCoV inter-stem-loop domain into the MHV background, viable virus appeared, but so did C145 and G169 within the window. this result suggested that C30U may not alone function as a suppressor but by some unknown mechanism hasten the appearance of suppressor mutations. a chimera was tested in which the entire MHV 5\u2032 UTR plus its 16-nt extension into its Nsp1 coding region was used with the adapted BCoV Nsp1 coding region. for this construct, the MHV 3\u2032 42 nt of the Nsp1 coding region were retained to keep the region compatible with the MHV papain-like protease that separates Nsp1 and Nsp2 (17). however, when a titer of 1.0 106 PFU/ml and a full set of viral sgmRNAs were obtained. this construct also demonstrated a compatibility requirement between the 5\u2032-UTR-located inter-stem-loop and downstream partnering domains for MHV replication. the chimeric virus must contain the MHV inter-stem-loop domain within the BCoV 5\u2032 UTR when in the MHV background. 'proximal region of the genome through the Nsp1 coding region to nt 906 was tested in construct B1-906/M. CPE was found within 24 hpt and viral progeny produced plaques, growth kinetics, a final titer, and a sgmRNA profile that were indistinguishable from those of wt MHV. without a reverse genetics system for BCoV, we could not apply the reciproc mutations were found in some but not all progeny at VP10. a UCUAA sequence was found inserted within the upstream transcription-regulatory sequence of all progeny by VP10. results together with the observation of very poor viral growth when the BCoV inter-stem-loop domain replaced the homologous native MHV domain. the cis-acting RNA elements in the 5\u2032 UTR and Nsp1 coding region are successfully recognized as a cognate unit. the long-range RNA-RNA interaction function for replication also explains, at least in part, the previously reported cis-replication requirement for the 5\u2032-terminal part of the Nsp1 coding region. stem-loops V and VI (equivalent to stem-loops 6 and 7 in reference 10; also data not shown) lie between the upstream and downstream partnering domains in the long-range RNA-RNA interaction. a possibly analogous long-range RNA-RNA interaction is predicted for each of the group 2b, 2c, and 2d coronaviruses as well, but in these cases, in contrast to the group 2a coronaviruses, the long- long-range RNA-RNA interactions are predicted within SL5 of the group 1a TGEV-Purdue-like coronaviruses (with a 106-nt terminal loop), the group 1b HCoV-229E-inf-1-like coronaviruses (with a 100-nt terminal loop), and the group 1d GId BtCoV-1A-like coronaviruses (with a 116-nt terminal coronaviruses is a postulated genome packaging signal (10, 18) each function as a higher-order cis-replication element for DI RNA in virus-infected cells. in experiments concurrent with those described above, attempts were made to analyze the cis-acting role of MHV SLV and SLVI in viral replication. however, structure-disrupting synonymous mutations were found available in only the MHV 83-nt SLV (nt this arrangement may suggest a possible functional switching between two alternate structures. a similar arrangement involving the four 3\u2032-terminal nucleotides in MHV SLVI (nt 332 to 335) is also possible. a similar arrangement involving the 3\u2032-terminal nucleotides in MHV SLVI (nt 332 to 335) is also possible. potential regulatory pathway for long-range RNA-RNA interaction could be maintenance of a proper acceptor orientation for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) template switching during generation of minus-strand templates for subgenomic mRNA synthesis. this is suggested by the appearance of the UCUAA component within the UCUAAAC intergenic transcriptional regulatory sequence following deletion of the 30-nt inter-stem-loop region. MHV behavior was altered as a function of amino acid changes arising from suppressor mutations. in no case was an amino acid-changing mutation found in the absence of other potential suppressor mutations, making it unfeasible to assess the effects of single amino acid changes."}
