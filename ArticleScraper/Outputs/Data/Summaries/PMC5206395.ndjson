C111 has two alanine substitutions (H1402A and R1403A) that eliminates its propensity to aggregate (48, 49) addition of C111 (20 nM) greatly enhanced HA-NHERF1 binding with full-length His-NHERF1 and His-PDZ1 compared with the level of interaction using HA-NHERF1 alone. oligomerization was detected by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody. after 5 min of exposure to cross-linker, protein complexes of discrete molecular mass corresponding to dimers, trimers, and tetramers of the NHERF1 were observed. increased duration of exposure to cross-linker did not alter the pattern or intensity of oligomerization. CFTR COOH-terminal construct is composed of residues 1370\u20131394, 1404\u20131424, and 1477\u20131480. the 1370\u20131394 sequence was not expected to affect NHERF1 oligomerization, but was included to create a construct of comparable length to C55 (48 a.a. vs 55 a.a.). blots are the overlay assays described above using the CFTR COOH-terminus (C111) with the following residues mutated to alanine: IE-QF (1404IEAMLECQQF1413), 1414LVI1416, 1417EEN1419, 1420KVR1422, and 1423QYD1425. single amino acid mutagenesis revealed that mutation of either glutamate (1417E or 1418E) was sufficient to eliminate enhancement of NHERF1 complex formation. substitution of residues 1419N, 1420K, or 1422R individually did not affect the ability of these sequences to enhance NHERF1 oligomerization. a parsimonious conclusion is to implicate the entire six-amino acid region 1417EENKVR1422 in the promotion of NHERF1 CFTR COOH-terminus is not independent of terminal PDZ-binding motif. effects of HA-NHERF1 binding to his-tagged NHERF1, PDZ1 and PDZ2 by preincubation with increasing concentration of C111. after PBST wash, the membrane was overlaid with HA-NHERF1 (10 nM) preincubated with C111 at 1 nM, 10 nM, 100 nM, or 200 the minimal construct C111-Del2, containing both TRL and the EENKVR region, inhibited complex formation when preincubated with HA-NHERF1 at 100 nM for 2 h. three cell lines expressed CFTR with all six residues (CFTR-1417EENKVR1422) and a fourth expressed CFTR with a deletion of PDZ-binding motif in the COOH-terminus (CFTR-DelTRL) parental MDCK-FRT cells showed minimal interaction between HA-NHERF1 and myc-NHERF1. both 1417EENKVR1422 and 1478TRL1480 sequences were required for enhanced oligomerization. both myc-NHERF1 and HA-NHERF1 were transiently cotransfected. C111 redistributed full-length CFTR to the cytosol, while C111-DelTRL failed to alter localization. apical localization of full-length CFTR requires the presence of both the internal EENKVR region and the terminal PDZ-binding motif. s is shown in red detected by Alexa Fluor 647, and CFTR in green detected by Alexa Fluor 488. all cells were counterstained with DAPI (blue) to detect the nuclei.

RNA-Seq predicted CFTR concentration in lung to be 5.2 nM. discrepancy between MS and RNA-Seq estimates of CFTR concentration in the sweat gland and lung may be due to its low expression level. eccrine sweat gland RNA-Seq data were obtained in house. color scale represents log10 transformed fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads. the CFTR COOH-terminus promotes oligomerization of NHERF1 at physiological concentration. full-length NHERF1 or sequences encompassing the PDZ1 or PDZ2 domains of NHERF1 with the His epitope fused to the NH2-terminus (500 ng of each) were immobilized on membrane and then incubated with HA-NHERF1 (HA epitope fused to the NH2-terminus) CFTR COOH-terminus enhances formation of NHERF1 oligomers at nanomolar concentrations. binding of HA-tagged NHERF1 with full-length His-tagged NHERF1, PDZ1 (a.a. 11\u2013101), and PDZ2 (a.a. 152\u2013358) detected with anti-HA antibody (1:20,000) coimmunoprecipitation of His-NHERF1 by HA-NHERF1 by C111. values are means SE (n = 3). ***P 0.001, one-way ANOVA. oligomerization was observed when the membrane was overlaid with C111. incubation with HA-NHERF1 alone, followed by a wash and subsequent incubation with C111, did not result in NHERF1 oligomerization (HA-NHERF1>>C111) a six-amino acid (1417EENKVR1422) sequence in the CFTR COOH-terminus fosters the formation of NHERF1 oligomers. to determine which regions in the CFTR COOH-terminus are involved in enhancing NHERF1 oligomerization, we performed overlay experiments with a series of CFTR COOH-terminal peptides. the last 77 amino acids of CFTR (C77) enhanced NHERF1 the Del2 peptide enhanced NHERF1 oligomerization to a level comparable to that of C77. Blots are the overlays of 10 nM HA-NHERF1 and 20 nM of each CFTR COOH-terminal deletion fragments. IE-QF (1404IEAMLECQQQF1413), 1414LVI1416, 1417EEN1419, 1420KVR1422 and 1423QYD1425 mutated to alanine. the graph illustrates quantitation of the blot overlay assays as described above. values are means SE (n = 5). 1417EENKVR1422 sequence acts in concert with PDZ-binding motif to form NHERF1 oligomers. the novel motif (1417EENKVR1422) required the presence of the terminal PDZ-binding motif (1478TRL1480) to foster NHERF1 oligomerization. at 1 nM, 10 nM, 100 nM, or 200 nM for 2 h. values are means SE (n = 3) after PBST wash, the membrane was overlaid with HA-NHERF1 (10 nM) preincubated with C111, C111-Del2, and C111-DelTRL. three cell lines expressed CFTR with all six residues (CFTR-1417EENKVR1422) and the first three residues (CFTR-1420KVR1422) of EENKVR substituted with alanines. a fourth expressed CFTR with a deletion of PDZ-binding motif in the COOH-terminus (CFTR-DelTRL) both 1417EENKVR1422 and 1478TRL1480 sequences were required for enhanced oligomerization. both myc-NHERF1 and HA-NHERF1 were transiently cotransfected. both myc-NHERF1 and HA-NHERF1 were transiently cotransfected. C111 redistributed full-length CFTR to the cytosol, while C111-DelTRL failed to alter localization of WT CFTR. the results demonstrate that preferential apical localization of full-length CFTR requires the presence of both the internal EENKVR region and the terminal PDZ-binding motif. CFTR is expressed in sweat gland and dysfunction of CFTR in sweat gland is a diagnostic feature of CF. sweat glands were dissected from freshly collected skin and subjected to LC-MS/MS and RNA-Seq. LC-MS/MS and RNA-Seq estimates of NHERF1 concentration in the sweat gland were similar. RNA-Seq predicted CFTR concentration in lung to be 5.2 nM. the discrepancy between MS and RNA-Seq estimates of CFTR concentration in the sweat gland and lung may be due to its low expression level. for biotechnology information (NCBI) Sequence Read Archive database for the pancreas. RNA-Seq and proteomic data on eccrine sweat gland RNA-Seq data were obtained in house. color scale represents log10 transformed fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads. full-length NHERF1 or sequences encompassing the PDZ1 or PDZ2 domains of NHERF1 with the His epitope fused to the NH2-terminus (500 ng of each) were immobilized on membrane and then incubated with HA-NHERF1 (HA epitope fused to the NH2-terminus) at concentrations ranging from 1 nM to 3,000 nM. low-affinity binding of HA-N blot was overlaid with increasing concentrations of HA-tagged NHERF1. blot was overlaid with increasing concentrations of HA-tagged NHERF1. values are means SE (n = 3). analysis of HA-NHERF1 oligomers in the presence of C111 or C111 mutants. reaction was quenched with ethanolamine (100 nM) at the time indicated. overlay experiments performed in the presence of a 111-amino acid (a.a.) peptide. HA- and His-tagged NHERF1 proteins (10 nM each) coimmunoprecipitate in the presence of C111 (20 nM) the complexes were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA affinity beads. terminus lacking the last three amino acids (C111-DelTRL) did not foster oligomerization. peptides containing the last 55 amino acids (C55) or the last 26 amino acids (C26) did not. these results indicated that the regions of CFTR responsible for NHERF1 oligomerization consisted of the PDZ-binding motif (a.a. 1477\u20131480) and COOH-terminal sequences between a.a. overlays of 10 nM HA-NHERF1 and 20 nM of each CFTR COOH-terminal deletion fragments were detected using anti-HA antibody (1:20,000) the graph illustrates the fraction of NHERF1 binding to the corresponding His tagged constructs in the presence of C111 deletion mutants. values are means SE (n = 5). blot overlay assays performed with alanine substitutions within residues 1404\u20131425 in the COOH-terminal peptide C111. mutation of either glutamate (1417E or 1418E) was sufficient to eliminate enhancement of NHERF1 complex formation. substitution of residues 1419N, 1420K, or 1422R individually did not affect the ability of these sequences to enhance NHERF1 oligomerization. formation of oligomers by 1417EENKVR1422 sequence in CFTR COOH-terminus is not independent of terminal PDZ-binding motif. HA-NHERF1 binding to the His-tagged NHERF1, PDZ1 and PDZ2 on the membrane were overlaid with C111 (20 nM) for 2 h. HA-NHERF1 (10 nM) preincubated with C111, C111-Del2, C111-EENKVR-alanine mutant, and C111-DelTRL (100 nM each) for 2 h. however, neither C111-EENKVR-alanine nor C111-DelTRL (100 nM each for 2 h) prevented the formation of HA-NHERF1 complexes. ylated protein was the predominant form of CFTR for all mutants except CFTR-EENKVR-alanine mutant. core glycosylated form of CFTR (band B) was the major translation product. each cell line was cotransfected with two versions of NHERF1. myc-NHERF1 and HA-NHERF1 were transiently cotransfected. both 1417EENKVR1422 sequence and PDZ-binding motif act in concert to facilitate localization of CFTR in polarized (MDCK II) cells. apical localization of full-length CFTR in polarized MDCK II cells is required. the newly identified region promotes the oligomerization of NHERF1 at concentrations that are well below its physiological levels. blot overlay assays are insufficient to conclude that oligomers are formed in solution and in the cellular environment. a comparative gene expression profile generated by RNA-Seq in multiple tissues, including sweat gland in our study, indicate that intracellular concentration of NHERF1 is in the nanomolar range. internal ligands have a consensus PDZ-binding sequence within a stable -finger structure with a hairpin region that mimics a free carboxyl group. the EENKVR region of CFTR is predicted to lie between two -strands capable of forming an anti-parallel -sheet (62). 1417E and 1418 E within 1417EENKVR1422 motif provide negatively charged groups that are critical for the forma tion of NHERF1 oligomers. we speculate that 1419NKVR1422 sequence forms a structural feature essential for the activity of the 1417EE1418 residues. apical targeting of variant CFTR was independent of NHERF1 interaction. coexpression of CFTR-C111-WT, but not C111-EENKVR-alanine or C111-delTRL, caused redistribution of full-length WT CFTR into the cytoplasm. three COOH-terminal motifs have been implicated in endocytic trafficking of CFTR. the 1417EENKVR1422 region is a new addition to the motifs at the CFTR COOH-terminus involved in its CFTR localization. two truncation mutations have been associated with elevated sweat chloride, but no lung disease.
