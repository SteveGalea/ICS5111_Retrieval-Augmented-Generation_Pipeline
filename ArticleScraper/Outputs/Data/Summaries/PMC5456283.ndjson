{"summary": "a 43-nucleotide genetic element with a highly conserved secondary structure has been described in four different families of positive-sense ssRNA viruses. the 3\u2032 stem-loop structure, referred to as s2m, was originally described in astroviruses where it appears to have been present in last common ancestor [6,7,8], but the element has been most thoroughly studied in the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) where the three- the presence of s2m near the 3\u2032 end of some coronavirus genomes has been documented previously [6,11], but due to the exponential growth of gene sequence data available through public databases, this review is an update on the current status of s2m in this virus family. there are 183 complete ORF1ab polyprotein sequences available from different strains of the MERS coronavirus. these sequences are represented by a single accession (genBank accession number ALB08298; isolate KOREA/Seoul/035-1-2015) the sequences belonging to the Torovirinae subfamily could not be reliably aligned. s2m appears to be approximately 10 times more common in complete genome sequences than in shorter GenBank submissions. s2m appears to be approximately 10 times more common in complete genome sequences than in shorter GenBank submissions. loss in the common ancestor of this group combined with loss prior to the divergence of the bottlenose dolphin coronavirus and the Beluga Whale coronavirus (edge 3) would thus indicate one gain and two independent losses. one could also hypothesize two independent gains (edge 2 and 5) in order to explain the s2m distribution in the gamma/delta cluster. s2m is absent in Rousettus bat coronavirus HKU9, which is a all clusters of identical s2m sequence groups were derived from viruses representing the same serogroups (beta, gamma or delta), indicating no recent transfers of the s2m element between these coronavirus clusters. s2m viruses infect higher vertebrates, making the permissive host species a lot more closely related than the viruses. s2m was discovered as an escape mutant in a vaccine development project. but it did not appear phenotypically different from closely related viruses in culturing experiments. s2m could potentially be involved in gene silencing. a paper documenting the presence of a non-canonical machinery for microRNA processing in the cytoplasm of human cells. it has been well described that DNA viruses replicating in the nucleus can hijack the cellular machinery for RNAi activity for the regulation of both viral and host genes. new results using a recombinant Sindbis virus show that this is also possible for RNA viruses. coronaviruses are positive-sense ssRNA viruses with non-segmented genomes that are polyadenylated and capped. the genomes may serve as mRNA for the translation of viral polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab through a frameshifting mechanism. after infection, the viral genome is replicated and subgenomic RNAs are generated via negative-strand RNA intermediates. 5\u2032 site could either be a five-prime cap (5\u2032 cap) or an RNA structure. s2m-containing picornaviruses lack 5\u2032 capping. a good system could be an astrovirus-derived infectious construct."}
