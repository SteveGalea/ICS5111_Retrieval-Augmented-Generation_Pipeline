{"summary": "objectives Feline leukaemia virus (FeLV), a gamma retrovirus, causes diseases of the feline haematopoietic system that are invariably fatal. rapid and accurate testing at the point-of-need supports prevention of virus spread and management of clinical disease. the prevalence of FeLV is in decline worldwide,6\u20138 owing to the widespread use of effective vaccines, as well as test and removal policies. the prevalence of FeLV is in decline worldwide,6\u20138 owing to the widespread use of effective vaccines. RT-qPCR assays detect viral RNA, which correlates well with viraemia and progressive infection. qPCR assays detect proviral DNA that has integrated into the genome of infected cells. progressively and regressively infected cats harbour proviral DNA. clinical performance of the POCKIT system is comparable to that of various laboratory qPCR or nested PCR assays for a number of veterinary-significant pathogens. a commercial RT-iiPCR that detects both viral RNA and proviral DNA (POCKIT FeLV Reagent Set; GeneReach USA) and an iiPCR that only detects proviral DNA (POCKIT FeLV Reagent Set; GeneReach USA) have been developed to help mycoplasma haemofelis DNA (Clinical Immunology Laboratory, University of Tennessee), feline coronavirus (FCoV; WSU 79-1683, ATCC VR-989 [ATCC]), feline herpesvirus (FHV; FVR-SGE [US Department of Agriculture]), feline calicivirus (FCV; F-9 strain, VR-782 [ATCC]) and FIV (NCSU VR-2333 [ATCC]) were used for the cells were examined for characteristic cytopathic effects daily for 4\u20136 days. positive (whole infectious virus) and negative (tissue culture medium) controls were included on each plate. the proviral qPCR described by Tandon et al was used routinely for the detection of FeLV proviral DNA. the 25 l reaction was run on a real-time thermal cycler at UTVMC (Smart Cycler 2; Cepheid) the programme included an initial denaturation step at 95\u00b0C for 10 mins, followed by 45 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s and 60\u00b0C for 35 s. the lyophilised premix was rehydrated with 50 l Premix Buffer B before a 5 l nucleic acid sample was added. the final mixture was transferred to an R-tube, which was spun briefly in a mini-centrifuge. the turnaround time was less than 1 h with the default programme of POCKIT. analysis, a non-linear regression model, was performed to determine the limit of detection at 95% (LOD95%). the lowest target concentration could be detected with 95% confidence interval (CI) using commercial software SPSS 14.0 (IBM) the 2 2 contingency tables were analysed by kappa () statistic. EDTA and heparinised plasma or serum samples submitted to VDS-UG were eligible for inclusion. a sub-confluent layer of QN1O cells in a 12-well plate was inoculated. the cells were examined for characteristic cytopathic effects daily for 4\u20136 days. negative cells were sub-cultured until day 15. both sites extracted nucleic acid from 200 l buffy coat obtained from EDTA blood. elution was performed with 100 l nuclease-free water at UTVMC. 150 l of heparinised plasma or serum was subject to extraction steps. nucleotides were numbered based on GenBank accession number KP728112.1 FeLV RT-iiPCR and iiPCR reagent sets (POCKIT FeLV Reagent Set and POCKIT FeLV Reagent Set [-RT], respectively) the results were shown as \u2018+\u2019 (positive) or \u2018\u2013\u2019 (negative) a final 30 min incubation with phosphatase substrate preceded quenching of the phosphatase activity with sodium hydroxide (Sigma-Aldrich) absorbance was measured using a spectrophotometer (Multiskan microplate reader; Thermo Scientific) high and low positive samples, as well as a negative sample were included as controls. a sample was considered positive when the absorbance was equal to, or exceeded, 150% of the negative control value the detection limit of the proviral qPCR was found at a dilution of 10\u20133 for both the VR-719 strain and the type A isolate. the iiPCR reached the detection limit at 10\u20132 and 10\u20133 dilutions with the VR-719 strain and the type A isolate.

PCR methods are more sensitive and specific than antigen immunoassays. the preferred sample is buffy coat. ssay have been shown to achieve 100% diagnostic sensitivity. p27-positive and proviral DNA (iiPCR-positive results) suggest a progressive infection; p27-negative and the iiPCR-positive results suggest regressive infection with the potential for future viral reactivation. p27 antigen immunoassay alone carries the risk of false-positive results owing to cross-reactivity. viral qPCR, both RT-iiPCR and proviral iiPCR systems could help rule out prior exposure to FeLV at PON. this would facilitate timely identification, care and placement of FeLV-infected animals in facilities such as vet clinics, shelters and customs inspection at ports of entry."}
