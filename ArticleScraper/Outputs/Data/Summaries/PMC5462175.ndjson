{"summary": "public health England (PHE) uses syndromic surveillance systems to monitor for seasonal increases in respiratory illness. identifying the incidence of specific respiratory pathogens circulating in the community is essential for public health interventions e.g. vaccination. syndromic data included consultations with family doctors, calls to a national telephone helpline and attendances at emergency departments. burden estimates were used to infer the proportion of patients affected by specific pathogens that would be diagnosed with different symptoms. influenza or RSV may be able to provide estimates for the mix of pathogens present in the community in real-time."}
