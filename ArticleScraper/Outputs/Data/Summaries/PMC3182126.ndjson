{"summary": "calf health was prioritised as one of the most important animal health issues facing the Irish livestock industry in a recent expert study conducted on behalf of animal health Ireland. a three-part review series on calf health from birth to weaning has been generated to provide evidence-based advice to Irish farmers, agricultural advisers and veterinary practitioners. the second part of this three part review series concentrates on the management of diarrhoea in pre-weaned calves. the first and third parts focus on general aspects of disease prevention in pre-weaned calves. calf diarrhoea enterotoxic Escherichia coli, Cryptosporidium parvum, rotavirus and coronavirus are the most common infectious causes of neonatal calf diarrhoe sodium is the osmotic skeleton of the extracellular fluid, it must be present in adequate concentration in ORS. a study comparing three ORS with different sodium concentrations in calves found that the solution with a sodium content of 120 mmol/L corrected dehydration, whereas solutions with much lower concentrations did not. the critical scientific step facilitating the development of oral rehydration therapy was the discovery of the coupled transport of sodium and glucose [16] ruminants are more prone to developing severe metabolic acidosis than infants during diarrhoea. the current recommendation on the alkalinising capacity for ORS used in calves is considerably higher than that of the current WHO-ORS formula. the impact of bicarbonate in ORS on milk clotting and calf performance is controversial. intravenous fluid therapy is indicated in severely depressed, recumbent, severely dehydrated (> 8%) and prolonged anorexic (> 24 h) calves. the principles and techniques of intravenous fluid therapy in calves have recently been reviewed. no scientific evidence is available to suggest that starvation of diarrhoeic calves leads to improved clinical outcomes. smolality ORS for calves is a reflection of a higher concentration of glucose. hypertonic solutions are known to slow abomasal emptying rates compared with isotonic solutions. indiscriminate use of antibiotics promotes the selection and subsequent proliferation of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria. additional ancillary treatment has been either suggested or used to treat diarrhoeic calves in the past, but is now either contraindicated (glucocorticoids, motility modifiers) or cannot be supported due to insufficient evidence of efficacy. faecal samples from untreated calves can be submitted for laboratory analyses. halofuginone has a demonstrated cryptosporidiostatic effect. it is licensed for prevention and treatment of cryptosporidiosis in calves. but it did not delay the onset of diarrhoea or reduce the risk of infection in group-housed calves. sodium is the osmotic skeleton of the extracellular fluid. a study comparing three ORS with different sodium concentrations in calves found that the solution with a sodium content of 120 mmol/L corrected dehydration, whereas solutions with much lower concentrations did not. ORS used in calves (60-80 mmol/L [15] is considerably higher than that of the current WHO-ORS formula (30 mmol/L [19]. bicarbonate alkalinises the abomasum to a higher degree than propionate and acetate. ORS should be given to calves as an extra feed as soon as diarrhoea is observed. intravenous fluid therapy is indicated in severely depressed, recumbent, severely dehydrated (> 8%) and prolonged anorexic (> 24 h) calves. no scientific evidence is available to suggest that starvation of diarrhoeic calves leads to improved clinical outcomes. indiscriminate use of antibiotics promotes selection and proliferation of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria. indiscriminate use of antibiotics in neonatal calf diarrhoea has been reviewed by Constable. faecal samples from untreated calves early in the course of clinical disease can be submitted for laboratory analyses. if specific preventive measures are considered, faecal samples from untreated calves early in the course of clinical disease can be submitted for laboratory analyses. rotavirus and cryptosporidia are the most frequently identified infectious agents in faecal samples from diarrhoeic calves. ousic et al. [50] found a reduction in severity of diarrhoea in calves born from vaccinated cows, whereas Kohara et al. [47] failed to find any clinical effect. halofuginone has a demonstrated cryptosporidiostatic effect. coccidiosis is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in pre-weaned calves. a range of measures are critical to disease prevention, including colostrum management and subsequent nutrition. authors made substantial inputs to the review, critically discussed the progressing manuscript and approved the final manuscript. authors from animal health Ireland's Technical Working Group (TWG) would like to thank the remaining colleagues of the TWG for their valuable input."}
