{"summary": "influenza A viruses (IAVs) cause worldwide outbreaks and seasonal pandemics, seriously impacting public health, as well as the economy. the highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) virus causes acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ failure with approximately 60% lethality. a strong need to explore new antiviral drugs against influenza virus. hemagglutinin plays critical roles in viral entry. HA is responsible for the binding of the virus to host cells. quercetin exerts antiproliferative [20], antioxidative [21], antibacterial [22], anticancer [23] and antiviral [24] effects. the details of its anti-influenza mechanism remain to be elucidated. quantitative real-time PCR detected quercetin\u2019s inhibition on the synthesis of viral mRNA in MDCK cells and A549 cells. the total RNA was isolated from the infected cells. quercetin reduced HA mRNA transcription in influenza-virus-infected cells in a dose-dependent manner. the results revealed that quercetin reduced HA mRNA transcription in influenza-virus-infected cells in a dose-dependent manner. the infected cells were treated with quercetin in 0\u20132 h, 2\u20135 h, 5\u20138 h, 8\u201310 h and 0\u201310 h time intervals during virus infection respectively. quercetin inhibited viral HA expression mainly in the 0\u20132 h and 0\u201310 h time intervals. the cells were infected with influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34. the virus-infected cells were then treated with quercetin in 0\u20132 h, 2\u20135 h, 5\u20138 h, 8\u201310 h and 0\u201310 h time intervals respectively. the viral HA protein was detected by Western blotting. cells were inoculated with quercetin for 1 h and subsequently washed to remove unbound viruses. the virus was incubated with quercetin at 4 \u00b0C for 30 min and washed to remove unbound viruses. the host cells were then further cultured at 37 \u00b0C for 48 h. cucurmin was used as a positive control with a KD value of 3.23 104 g/mL in our assay. the interaction between small molecules and protein induces molecular changes in size, charge, hydration shell and conformation. the compound CL-385319, reported previously to have interacted with the influenza HA protein [28], was used as a positive control. NT647 (NanoTemper Technologies) labeled recombinant influenza HA protein was mixed with two-fold diluted compounds in the same volume as that of the final concentrations. hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) assay to detect whether quercetin could interfere with the interaction between HA and cellular receptors. quercetin diluted in PBS was mixed with an equal volume of the influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) in a 96-deep well plate. 2% chicken erythrocytes pre-warmed at 37 \u00b0C for another 30 min. the results confirm that quercetin could effectively inhibit the entry of divergent strains of the H5N1 virus. the data reconfirmed the result and confirmed that quercetin could effectively inhibit influenza virus entry through its interaction between HA proteins. the in vitro cytotoxicity of quercetin was tested by the MTT assay. quercetin exhibited no significant cytotoxicity on MDCK cells or A549 cells at the concentrations as high as 250 g/mL. IC50 and IC90 of quercetin were detected by quantitative real-time PCR at 24 h post-infection. cells were infected with the influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) virus. quercetin reduced HA mRNA transcription in influenza-virus-infected cells in a dose-dependent manner. the total RNA was isolated from the infected cells and analysed by quantitative real-time PCR using primers specific for the viral HA mRNA. the infected cells were treated with quercetin in 0\u20132 h, 2\u20135 h, 5\u20138 h, 8\u201310 h and 0\u201310 h time intervals during virus infection respectively. we performed a time-of-addition assay to study the inhibitory effect of quercetin. quercetin performed the inhibitory activity in the initial stage of influenza virus infection. the cells were infected with influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34. the virus-infected cells were then treated with quercetin in 0\u20132 h, 2\u20135 h, 5\u20138 h, 8\u201310 h. cells were inoculated with quercetin at 4 \u00b0C for 1 h and subsequently washed to remove unbound viruses and compounds. the virus was incubated with quercetin at 4 \u00b0C for 30 min and subsequently washed to remove unbound viruses. the host cells were then further cultured at 37 \u00b0C for 48 h. quercetin showed medium-binding affinity to HA protein with a KD value of 1.14 103 g/mL. cucurmin was used as a positive control with a KD value of 3.23 104 g/mL. the interaction between small molecules and protein induces molecular changes in size, charge, hydration shell and conformation. the binding curve of quercetin with NT647 labeled recombinant influenza HA protein was mixed with two-fold diluted compounds in the same volume as that of the final concentrations. the compound CL-385319 was used as the positive control. the compound CL-385319 was used as the positive control. quercetin could inhibit influenza-virus-HA-mediated hemolysis in a dose-dependent manner. the results indicated that quercetin could target the membrane fusion process during virus entry. the virus was incubated with serally diluted quercetin at room temperature for 30 min. plasmids from IAV H5N1 virus strains confirmed that quercetin could effectively inhibit the entry of divergent strains of the H5N1 virus. the results confirm that quercetin had no effect on the infection of the VSV-G pseudovirus. in vitro cytotoxicity of quercetin was tested by the MTT assay. quercetin exhibited no significant cytotoxicity on MDCK cells or A549 cells at the concentrations as high as 250 g/mL. antivirus agents have become an attractive antiviral strategy [32] to date, no drug-blocking viral entry is available for the treatment and prevention of influenza. however, to date, no drug-blocking viral entry is available for the treatment and prevention of influenza. a solution-based MST assay was performed to further confirm the binding affinity between quercetin and HA. the HI assay and hemolysis inhibition assay indicated that quercetin efficiently inhibited entry of the influenza A virus. quercetin is a novel antiviral agent, which may be used as an effective, safe and affordable chemoprophylaxis or treatment of influenza infection. we will explore the potential synergistic antiviral effect of quercetin and other antiretroviral agents in vitro and in vivo. stocks of these strains were propagated in the allantoic cavities of 9-day-old embryonated hen eggs at 37 \u00b0C for two days. subsequently, allantoic fluid was harvested, centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min and stored at 80 \u00b0C until use. the virus titer was determined by the analysis of the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) the inhibition of viral replication was evaluated by determining the protection against the virus-induced cytopathic effect through microscopy. at 48 h post-infection, the total mRNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent and then reverse-transcribed into cDNA using primeScript RT reagent kit. all samples were run in triplicate. the primer sequences for each gene are listed in Table 3. the monolayer of MDCK cells grown in a 6-well plate were infected with the influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) virus. the monolayer of MDCK cells grown in a 6-well plate were treated with quercetin at the concentration of 50 g/mL in different time intervals. at 10 h post-infection, the total protein and mRNA were isolated from cells by radio immune precipitation assay. recombinant influenza HA was injected as analytes at various concentrations. phosphate buffered saline was regenerated with gly-HCl (pH 2.0) and washed with the running buffer.
