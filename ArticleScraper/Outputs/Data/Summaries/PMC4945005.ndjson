RC network sample contained 176 nodes (N) and 685 edges (E) with and values of +6.7 and 0.27. the equivalent random network with the same number of nodes and edges as the FRC network has both = 1 and = 0.93 positive. a regular ring lattice network with the same number of nodes and eight edges per node connecting to nearest neighbors fulfills the condition for small-worldness with = 3.53. the FRC network was partially restored on day 14 (Fig 2A, S1B and S1C Fig) the FRC network had been rebuilt on day 28 to an extent that was indistinguishable from controls. basic single-cell parameters, namely FRC surface area (Fig 2C) and volume (Fig 2D), had not yet reached levels of controls. scale bars represent 30 m.

Govern FRC Network Structural Integrity The next set of experiments was performed to determine the structural stability of the FRC network under conditions of partial removal of nodes. graded doses of DT were applied, and FRC morphology and topology were assessed. a distinct threshold for FRC network integrity exists as the network structure was destroyed when more than 70% of the cells were ablated. the factor is not sensitive to strong alterations in the FRC network introduced by partial node removal. the topological analysis based on increasing FRC ablation indicates that the essential FRC network features remain stable when 40% of the cells are removed. vertical lines in the 3-D plot represent projections on the bottom 2-D plane. the line on the 2-D plane represents a linear regression model for surface area and volume. the line on the 2-D plane represents a linear regression model for surface area and volume. network topology and nature of node loss determine robustness of the network. a network will have higher robustness the closer the curve is to the minimal damage line (Fig 6C, dashed line) the estimated network robustness ranges between maximum vulnerability (R = 0) and maximum robustness (R = 0.5) the topological model predicts that network robustness is not significantly reduced when 37% of the FRCs are ablated. ablation of >50% of FRCs, i.e., at doses of 1 and 2 ng/g DT, will lead to a significant reduction of network robustness. data represent mean SD over 1,000 simulations of random node removals. data represent mean SD for 3\u20136 mice per group from two independent experiments. ns, not significant; na, not applicable. cell tracking analysis revealed comparable T cell speeds and arrest coefficients with DT doses of 1 ng/g. a significant decrease in T cell speeds was observed at DT doses of 2 ng/g, with a concomitant increase in cell arrest (Fig 7E and 7F). CD45+ hematopoietic cells (A), CD8+ T cells (B) and CD11c+ DCs (C) in Ccl19idtr mice injected twice IP with indicated doses of DT. migration parameters analyzed include average cell speed (E), cell arrest coefficient (F), and motility coefficient (G). most parameters are highly correlated with increasing doses of DT (Pearson r > 0.8), indicating that they are decreasing with declining FRC numbers. only the omega factor did not significantly correlate with any other parameter. our results are in line with a previous study that demonstrated profound effects of complete FRC network ablation on T and B cell activation. however, the complete destruction or ablation of components does not reveal the extensive complexity of a system. global systems parameters such as topological organization and robustness need to be considered in order to design strategies for system modulation or regeneration. the topological model based on samples of the T cell zone FRC network predicted with high accuracy the functional consequences of FRC loss. the morphological and topological parameters generated here will help to further advance development of mathematical LN models. this suggests that the R index of the FRC network can be considered as a biologically relevant and consistent measure of robustness with global functional implications in the immune system. it is possible that these physical, non-random networks might have developed under evolutionary pressure to establish their structure and achieve optimal functionality. inguinal LNs from individual mice were pooled and digested on 37\u00b0C in RPMI containing 2% FCS, 20 mM Hepes (all from Lonza), 1 mg/ml Collagenase Type P (Sigma-Aldrich), and 25 g/ml DNaseI (AppliChem) after enzymatic digestion, cell suspensions were washed with PBS. injection of non-replicating coronaviral particles was performed 12 h following the first viral particle injection. inguinal LNs were fixed overnight at 4\u00b0C in freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde (Merck-Millipore). single-cell morphometric analysis was used to calculate morphological parameters for FRCs. single-cell morphometric analysis was used to calculate morphological parameters for FRCs. DAPI staining was used by masking it to the EYFP channel. the network was determined according to and parameters as described in [33\u201335] for the calculation of the small-world parameters. the values of shortest path length and clustering coefficient were averaged over 100 realizations of an equivalent random network for each FRC network dataset per mouse. network robustness was estimated using the R parameter [58], and the threshold point was determined at the maximum value of the network average shortest path length. GraphPad Prism 5 was used for all statistical analyses. differences with a p-value 0.05 were considered statistically significant. enzymatic digestion, cell suspensions were washed with PBS and stained using the following antibodies: CD3-PE (BD Bioscience), CD8-PeCy7, CD4-FITC, CD45-APC-H7, MHCII-PE, CD11c-PeCy7, B220-APC (BioLegend) in flow cytometric analyses, 7-amino-actinomycin D (7AAD; Calbiochem) was used to sections were sectioned with 10% FCS, 1 mg/ml anti-FcR (BD) and 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) sections were stained with 4\u2032,6-diamidin-2-phenylindol (DAPI) FRCs that were cut at the dataset borders encompassing more than half of the central body and diving and apoptotic cells were excluded from further analysis. minimal distances between single FRCs were determined using the Spots module. error tolerance was calculated by sequentially removing increasing number of nodes randomly from the network. the threshold point was determined at the maximum value of the network average shortest path length as fractions of nodes are removed. two IP injections of 8 ng DT per gram mouse weight were given to Ccl19eyfp/idtr at the indicated time points. the analysis was performed on day 0 (complete ablation), day 14 (partial restoration), and day 28 (complete restoration). two-photon microscopy analysis of meandering index of adoptively transferred CD8+ T cells into Ccl19idtr mice injected twice IP with indicated doses of DT. data represent mean standard error of the mean (SEM) for 6\u201320 mice per group from three independent experiments (A\u2013B) data represent linear regression models using Pearson correlation for mean values SD of the indicated parameters for each DT dose 0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 8 ng/g in naive adult Ccl19idtr mice stained for EYFP, PDPN, and DAPI. a small zoom-in area with several single FRCs was selected to generate the representative T cell zone FRC network. the 3-D reconstructions of EYFP+ FRCs (white) were masked to the DAPI channel. the entire EYFP+ network was then 3-D reconstructed using an automatic threshold. the surface area and volume of the whole FRC network was calculated. intraavital two-photon microscopy analysis of T cell movement in LN T cell zone from 8 ng/g DT-treated mice. three-dimensional reconstructions of T cells (cyan) and high endothelial venules (grey) in a representative T cell zone 300 x 300 x 64 m."}
