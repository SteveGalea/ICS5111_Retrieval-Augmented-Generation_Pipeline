{"summary": "rapidly evolving pathogens are subject to some of the strongest evolutionary forces that have been reported in evolutionary biology. viruses undergo adaptive change at genomic sites targeted by the humoral (Bush et al. 1999; Frost et al. 2005); cellular (Kawashima et al. 2009); innate immune responses (Rehermann 2009); sometimes sweeping to fixation in a matter of weeks (Henn et al. 2012); and subject to selective coefficients as high as 0.03 we focus on HIV-1, a chronic infection, and influenza A virus (IAV), an acute infection. this variation can be harnessed to make qualitative (e.g., clinical) and quantitative inferences from sampled viral gene sequence data. a cell by multiple, heterogeneous sequences can produce hybrid progeny. reassortment of segments may occur in a dual infection leading to the production of new genotypes. this mechanism is postulated to account for the major antigenic shift of IAV. selective sweeps can result in mutations rising to high frequency due to hitchhiking. selective sweeps can result in mutations rising to high frequency due to hitchhiking. selective sweeps can result in mutations rising to high frequency due to hitchhiking. the divergence of HIV-1 and IAV has been found to conform to the molecular clock hypothesis, both at the level of the entire viral population. the original strict clock estimates of the time of introduction for the HIV-1 group M pandemic were only slightly refined using much more complex models. incorporating detailed sequence information such as risk group, location of isolation, and even relative geographical distances into a relaxed molecular clock model. in HIV infection, there is evidence to suggest that the rate of the evolution at the population level is intimately associated with the rate of transmission. rapid transmission restricts the time for the virus to diversify within the host. many drug resistance mutations revert to wild-type alleles, although at markedly different rates. but some remain fixed in new hosts (Castro et al. 2013). there has been considerable debate as to whether drug-resistant mutations are sourced from standing genetic variation. the way pleiotropic and epistatic gene effects are organized within the genotype\u2013phenotype (G\u2013P) map is expected to play a pivotal role in the ability of viruses to adapt and evolve. the fitness landscape of these resistance mutations has been a challenge to characterize quantitatively. HA inhibition assays show that H3N2 sequences can be clustered. between 1968 and 2003, these clusters emerged and replaced each other within as little as 2\u20138 years. cross-immunity is as low as 60\u201385% between clusters adjacent in time. single-cell analysis of IAV infection has demonstrated that high variation in the number of progeny released by an infected cell and extrinsic noise affecting viral replication can drive down genetic variation and increase the importance of stochastic effects. diversity within even partially immune swine is significant and highly dynamic over the course of infection. only a fraction of theoretically tolerable mutations have been fixed in natural viral populations due to the finite timespan during which evolution has been exploring possible sequences. the application of NGS techniques to in vitro functional selection of large mutant protein libraries has proven to be a rapid and inexpensive methodology for exploring individual viral fitness landscapes. further examination could reveal additional sites targeted by the wide array of drugs available and by other arms of the host immune response. additional studies using viral replication in alternative cell populations should also make it possible to isolate the specific role of these selective pressures in shaping HIV and IAV evolution. reassessment."}
