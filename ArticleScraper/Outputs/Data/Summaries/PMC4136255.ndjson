{"summary": "a comprehensive understanding of the pathogenesis of H5N1 virus infection is needed to develop effective prevention and intervention strategies. human patients infected with H5N1 virus develop progressive pneumonia accompanied by diffuse alveolar damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome (2\u20138) the differences in host responses to different H5N1 virus strains originate from differential expression of host genes related to specific biologic events. the differences in severity of the disease outcome upon infection with different H5N1 viruses originate from differential expression of host genes related to specific biologic events. the six highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 viruses analyzed in this studya Virus strain Abbreviation Clinical outcome of patient HA clade Receptor-binding specificityb PB1-F2 PB2 NS1 2,3 2,6 66 591 627 701 92 C terminus A/Vietnam/UT3028II/2004 clone3 VN3028IIcl3 Died 1 ++++ ++++ N three macaques per group were anesthetized with ketamine (5 mg/kg) and xylazine (1 mg/kg) and inoculated with a suspension containing 107 PFU of each H5N1 virus/ml. one macaque died on day 9 and underwent pathological and virological analyses. macaques were euthanized on day 14 p.i. for pathological analysis. excised lung tissue was preserved in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin. each tissue sample was stained using a standard hematoxylin-and-eosin procedure. Statistical analysis was performed using the LIMMA package. the log2 of the intensity of each probe was background corrected. hierarchical clustering was used to review biological replicate quality. a module eigengene was defined as significantly correlated with virus titer if they had a correlation value of 0.6. toppCluster uses the Fisher exact test to determine annotations that are enriched in a set of genes. only annotations with scores of >2 (corresponding to an FDR of 0.01) are reported. all experiments with these H5N1 viruses were performed in approved enhanced biosafety level 3 (BSL3) containment laboratories. cynomolgus macaques were monitored every 15 min for changes in body temperature. telemetry probes were implanted in their peritoneal cavities. macaques were monitored every 15 min for changes in body temperature. b samples were collected and suspended in 500 l of phosphate-buffered saline. one macaque died on day 9 (macaque 9) and underwent pathological and virological analyses. the other macaques were euthanized on day 14 p.i. individual microarrays were performed for each bronchial brush sample. Statistical analysis was performed using the LIMMA package. hierarchical clustering was used to review biological replicate quality. a module eigengene was defined as being significantly correlated with virus titer if they had a correlation value of 0.6. toppCluster uses the Fisher exact test to determine annotations that are enriched in a set of genes. only annotations with scores of >2 are reported. three of the viruses recognize -2,6-linked sialic acid (human-type receptor) and -2,3-linked sialic acid (avian-type receptor) the other viruses recognize only -2,3-linked sialic acid (avian-type receptor), whereas the other viruses recognize only -2,3-linked sialic acid (21). three macaques per group were inoculated with 107.8 PFU (total volume, 7.0 ml) of each H5N1 virus through multiple routes. temperature was monitored every 15 min by telemetry probes implanted in the peritoneal cavities. number 1 to 17 indicate animal identification numbers (IDs) bronchial brushes, nasal swabs, and rectal swabs were collected on every second day after infection. no virus was detected in rectal swabs throughout the study. titers in respiratory swabs collected from H5N1 virus-infected animals. 1 dpi 3 dpi 5 dpi 7 dpi 9 dpi 1 3.1 1.0 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 2.7 2.6 1.0 \u2013 2.6 1.6 2.8 2.8 2.0 a Bronchial brushes and nasal swabs were collected every other day for virus titration after virus infection. b, Virus not detected (detection limit = 1.0 log10 PFU/ml). dpi, days p.i. the virus titer of the tonsils was also high, which is consistent with previous reports in macaques and in ex vivo culture of human tissue. no virus was detected in the heart, spleen, kidney, liver, small intestines, brain of this animal, indicating that VN3040 did not cause an infection. a frozen tracheal swab and a frozen blood sample were examined. some bacteria were detected from the tracheal swab, as well as from the blood sample. these are indigenous bacteria, which are commonly found in intestines, on the skin, or in soil. these observations are identical to those in human patients who died as a result of H5N1 virus infection (6\u20138). this suggests that these histological lesions induced by VN3040 infection would reflect respiratory failure, leading to death. analyzed animals infected with VN3040, which replicated efficiently in the lower respiratory tract. total RNA was extracted from each bronchial brush sample. compared genes that were DE in severe and mild disease cases on each day. total RNAs were extracted from each bronchial brush sample collected from each animal infected with VN3040, VN3028IIcl3 or VN30259 at preinfection and on days 1, 3, 5, and 7 p.i. in each infection group, postinfection samples were compared to preinfection samples from the respective animal to identify DE genes on each day of the infection. all of the genes belonging to the 125- and 135- probe sets are listed in Tables S1 and S2 in the supplemental material. the 125-probe set, which was upregulated only in mild cases, contained many interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs; 74 gene probes, 59.2%) functional enrichment analysis of these 135 gene probes revealed that a large proportion of these genes was associated with \u201cinnate immune response\u201d (score 10), indicating that upregulation of these 135 gene probes was largely involved in the interferon responses to control the virus infection. the fold change values in the expression of ISGs, especially IFIT1/2/3, OAS2, GBP1, RSAD2 (viperin), IFITM1/2, APOBEC3G, and TRIM22 among the eigengene of each module is a scaled representation of the expression of the genes assigned to each module to explore for potentially strain-dependent responses (55). this coexpression analysis is not biased by existing knowledge of pathways or interactions and can identify systemic gene expression patterns based on underlying correlation structures. the time points for sample collection and the animal IDs (1 to 9) are indicated above and below the graph. enriched gene functiona (enrichment score) ISG content (%)b M1 1,140 Microtubule-based process (10), cell projection assembly (10) 6.0 M2 922 Immune response (10), innate immune response (10), adaptive immune response (10), inflammatory response (10), lymphocyte activation (10), lymphocyte migration (10), positive regulation of apoptotic process (10), coagulation (10), M11 was not enriched by any GO biological process but was enriched by GO molecular functions. no enriched GO function was identified. a Genes in each module were analyzed using ToppCluster. a remarkable upregulation of M6, M7, M9, and M10 on day 1 was observed in cl3- and VN30259-infected animals. in contrast, VN3040-infected animals exhibited attenuated responses for these modules. all of these gene modules contained many ISGs based on the Interferome (30) M6 contained the RelA gene (RELA), a subunit of the pleiotropic transcription factor NF-B. M7 contained type I interferon (IFNA8, IFNA16, and IFNA21) genes. M7 was functionally enriched as \"innate immune response,\" \"pattern recognition receptor signaling pathway\" and \"regulation of sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factor activity\" M9 was functionally enriched as \"antigen processing and presentation of peptide antigen via MHC class I\" also upregulated in mild cases on day 1. there was no clear difference between severe and mild cases in expression of these genes in the late phase of infection. the dramatic upregulation of M2 genes in VN3040-infected animals would represent the severe pathological condition of these animals. the expression of these cytokines/chemokines resembles the hyperinduction of cytokines/chemokines that has been observed in human patients with fatal outcomes (9, 10) the gene module also contained many ISGs (170 gene probes, 18.4%) cynomolgus macaques infected groups of three cynomolgus macaques with one of six H5N1 influenza virus strains. these viruses were chosen because their history is well known; they were also chosen because their receptor specificity was known. these strains were isolated from humans in 2004 or 2005, and all except for VN30408cl7 resulted in fatal infections. all animals infected with VN3040 and one infected with VN3028IIcl3 exhibited decreased activity and mild depression. some animals huddled slightly or exhibited coughing, nasal discharge, and piloerection of body hair. day 2 2 \u2013 3 Mild coughing on day 10 VN30259 4 \u2013 5 Mild huddling on day 5; nasal discharge on days 5 and 6 6 \u2013 VN3040 7 Decreased activity on days 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8; mild depression on day 5 9 Decreased activity and lying down on day 8. infection by day 5 or 7 was detected in the bronchus through day 7. but in nasal swabs it was only detected in two of three macaques through day 3. efficient virus replication appears to contribute to disease severity in macaques. 3.6 1.0 1.0 2.5 Died VN3062 10 3.8 4.1 3.6 \u2013 \u2013 2.2 2.5 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 11 3.6 3.6 3.6 3.6 1.7 1.5 \u2013 1.0 1.0 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 12 4.2 4.3 3.3 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 VN30408cl7 13 2.0 1.0 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 1.5 1.7 1.6 \u2013 \u2013 the pathogenicity shown by the inoculated viruses was due to any of these substitutions that became dominant during replication in animals. some previous studies have reported detection of H5N1 viruses outside the respiratory tract. the cause of death for VN3040-infected macaque 9 virus distribution in its organs was analyzed. five amino acid substitutions compared to consensus sequence of the inoculum were detected among 13 isolates from the tissues of the animal 9. one substitution detected in a lung lobe was also found in a nasal swab from animal 8, which was infected with the same virus (VN3040) pathological changes in lungs after H5N1 virus infection. lungs of macaque 9, which died on day 9, exhibited severe lesions with diffuse alveolar damage in some lobes. these observations are identical to those in human patients who died as a result of H5N1 virus infection. the alveolar and bronchiolar walls were thickened due to infiltration of lymphocytes, alveolar epithelial cells, and neutrophils. different host responses elicited by different H5N1 virus strains in the early phase of infection. we performed global gene expression profiling by expression microarray. fewer gene probes (202 gene probes; 180 upregulated and 22 downregulated) were DE on day 1 but the number of DE gene probes gradually increased with time. these results suggest that the host transcriptional response in the early phase of infection may contribute to the control of the virus infection. the differences in the DE gene probes in the early phase of infection may contribute to the control of the virus infection. 125 gene probes were upregulated only by VN3028IIcl3 and VN30259 infections (mild cases), and 135 gene probes that were commonly upregulated by infection with all three viruses. the 125-probe set, which was upregulated only in mild cases, contained many interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), including SOCS2, HLAs, GBP2, DDX58 (RIG-I), CXCL11, FAS, T 105 of the 135 gene probes upregulated in all three infections were ISGs. innate immune response, apoptosis, and antigen presentation may be important. a large proportion of these genes was associated with \"innate immune response\" the expression levels of type III interferon genes (IL-28A, IL-28B, and IL-29) induced by VN3040 were higher than those by VN3028IIcl3 and VN30259 infections. these findings suggest that limited induction of ISGs in the early phase of infection is related to disease severity. the 11 gene modules identified here were further analyzed for enriched GO categories. for each gene module, the expression levels of the eigengene for each sample are indicated by a colored bar. innate immune response (10), pattern recognition receptor signaling pathway in response to virus (10), type I interferon production (10), type I interferon-mediated signaling pathway (10), response to virus (10), cytokine production (10), cytokine-mediated signaling pathway (10), regulation of apoptotic process (10), IFN-mediated signaling pathway (5.8) the x axis represents the virus titer and the y axis represents the expression level of the eigengene of the gene module. each marker indicates each sample; virus strains are indicated by different colors. significant correlations between the virus titers and expression levels of genes were observed for M2, M6, and M7. and TLR3, which recognize influenza virus infection (56\u201360), type I (IFNA5) and type III (IL-28B and IL-29) interferons (61, 62), and ISGs with anti-influenza virus functions (MX1, EIF2AK2 [PKR], OAS1/2/3/L, ISG15, ISG20, RSAD2 [viperin], BST2 [tetherin], IFITM1/2, IFIT1/2/3, G correlation analysis revealed that there were significant correlations between virus titers and the expression levels of genes in these gene modules. insufficient expression of M6 and M7 genes early in infection allows continuous virus replication, resulting in excessive upregulation of M6 and M7 later in the infection. there was a remarkable difference in M2 expression in the late phase of infection between severe and mild cases. VN3040-infected animals showed a dramatic upregulation of M2 genes on days 3 to 7. GO functionally enriched as \u201cinnate immune response,\u201d \u201cadaptive immune response,\u201d \u201cinflammatory response,\u201d \u201clymphocyte activation/migration,\u201d \u201cgamma interferon production\u201d and \u201capoptosis\u201d. inflammation activates coagulation, which in turn activates inflammation (67, 68), and the expression and function of ion channels that control homeostasis are influenced by cytokines/chemokines and other inflammatory mediators (69). we compared the pathogenicity of six highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses that were isolated from humans in a nonhuman primate model. respiratory organs induced sustained activation of the innate immune response and excessive activation of inflammation, coagulation, and homeostatic process in the late phase of infection. however, it is not clear why the virus was able to replicate under the strong upregulation of interferons and ISGs at the later time in the infection. differences in NS1 and HA are potentially important, because NS1 inhibits host antiviral responses elicited by type I and III interferons. NS1 limits interferon production pretranscriptionally (by inhibiting RIG-I activation) and posttranscriptionally (by inhibiting the nuclear posttranscriptional processing) c NS1 of these three viruses contained a deletion of amino acids 80 to 84. the truncated C-terminal region of NS1 possesses some functional sites. the PDZ-binding motif \u201cESEV\u201d at the C-terminal 4 amino acids (22) contributes to pathogenicity in a host species-specific manner. ca. 20% of NS1 proteins from different subtypes of influenza A viruses have C-terminal truncations of the same, smaller, or even a larger size. HA of VN3040 recognizes only 2,3-linked sialic acid, while that of VN3028IIcl3 and VN30259 also recognizes 2,6-linked sialic acid. a highly pathogenic virus that recognizes 2,3-linked sialic acid infects type II pneumocytes, Clara cells, and bronchial epithelial cells in macaques in the early phase of infection. a highly pathogenic virus that recognizes 2,3-linked sialic acid infects type II pneumocytes, resulting in less lung damage (82) ferrets and mice are used to study influenza, but highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses cause systemic infection. systemic infections rarely occur with H5N1 viruses in humans (8, 93)"}
