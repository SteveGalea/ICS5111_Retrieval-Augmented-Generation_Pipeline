{"summary": "accidents occur in laboratories, hospitals, and animal handling facilities. most common routes of pathogen entry are aerosol inhalation, percutaneous inoculation through needles or broken glass, animal bites or scratches, direct contact with contaminated surfaces, and accidental ingestion through a pipette2. based on the quantification of leakage liquid volume is desired, given that our previous study found a positive correlation between volume of leaked SB and the number of microbes that penetrated PPC15. we modified the ISO 22609 test method using absorption paper to measure leaked liquid volume through woven and non-woven materials. 1 Class 1 Class 1 Class 1 Class 1 Class 1 Type Nonwoven Sample No. 6 7 8 9 10 11 Materials PP 100% PET 45% Wood pulp 55% PP 100% PP and PE 100% PE 100% Spunbond Spunlace Spunlace SMS Flushspun Finishing \u2014 Repellent \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Weight (g/m2) 70 70.4 56 51.45 41.0 41.0 Use Gown, Protective clothing Mask, Gown, Drape Protective clothing, Gown Protective clothing a 2-ml volume of SB was ejected from the splash gun onto the sample. the back of the sample was checked for leaked SB. the test was repeated five times for each sample. higher-class fabrics were more resistant to pressure, i.e., of those that were woven, samples 1, 2, and 4 were in class 1, whereas samples 3 and 5 were in class 1. samples were cut into squares measuring 1313 cm for testing. the diagram of test devices (a) and time course graph of applied pressure (b) based on JIS T 8060 are shown. pressure is increased step-by-step at 5-minute intervals. if it was observed visually that the SB did not leak through a protective clothing sample at 3.5 kPa but did leak at 7 kPa after more than 15 minutes, the sample was classified into Class 3. the distance between the splash gun and sample holder was 30 cm. a 2-ml volume of SB was ejected by the splash gun at the sample. leaked volume was correlated with splash gun pressure for all samples. sample 10 and 11 had similar leakage volumes at 21.3 and 16.0 kPa. volume varied by more than 100-fold between sample 6 and samples 10 and 11. fail rate was 2/5 based on the absorption paper and 1/5 by visual inspection; for sample 11, the rates were 4/5 and 3/5, respectively. therefore, leakage could be detected with greater sensitivity using absorption paper than by visual inspection (i.e. the ISO 22609 test). the volume of SB penetrating five woven fabric samples was quantified. values represent the mean of five experiments, and error bars denote standard deviation. samples 10 and 11 had similar leakage volumes at 21.3 and 16.0 kPa. the sample fabric was considered having failed the splash test if SB leakage was detected. for woven sample 3, the fail rate was 5/5 based on the absorption paper and 0/5 by visual inspection. for sample 11, the rates were 4/5 and 3/5, respectively. therefore, leakage could be detected with greater sensitivity using absorption paper than by visual inspection. a modified version of the ISO 22609 test found that the volume of leaked liquid was dependent on the structural characteristics of each material. detecting sensitivity was improved by using absorption paper rather than by relying on simple visual inspection. there are few methods currently available for testing the performance of protective materials against hazardous biological agents. these tests typically measure the penetration of a liquid/particle or the permeation of molecules through PPE materials or membranes21. materials with high protective performance against penetration or permeation of liquids are equally suitable for protection against hazardous biological agents.
