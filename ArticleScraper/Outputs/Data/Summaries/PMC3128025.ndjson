{"summary": "the aim of this study is to assess spatiotemporal patterns in influenza-associated hospitalizations in the elderly, by time, geography, and intensity of P&I. the study is among the first to quantify spatiotemporal patterns in influenza-associated hospitalizations in the elderly. influenza and pneumonia consistently remain in the top ten causes of death nationwide. there is substantial inter-seasonal variation in the geographical distribution of disease, timing, severity, and the population groups most affected. influenza occurs throughout the united states non-uniformly [6] patients with za-associated morbidity accounted for nearly 700,000 average annual hospitalizations from 1998 to 2002. the elderly, who experience the most severe morbidity and highest mortality from influenza, are also one of the most mobile population groups due to their frequent seasonal migrations. popular destinations in the united states include Florida, Arizona, and Texas. 21.5 million hospitalization records obtained from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services were abstracted based on a set of previously established entry criteria. variables used in this analysis are patient's age, date of admission, state of residence, and state in which the patient was hospitalized. for the national state-level analysis, we compiled cumulative frequencies of the P&I hospitalization in two time periods. the original states of residence of the non-floridian were tabulated. the counts were then segregated by the two periods of time for calculating the seasonal ratios. the resultant ratios were visualized using mapping. variables used in this analysis are patient's age, date of admission, state of residence and state in which the patient was hospitalized. for the national state-level analysis, we compiled cumulative frequencies of the P&I hospitalization in two time periods. for the analysis on Florida, we created a 5884-day-long time series by compiling daily counts of the P&I hospitalization. time series plots were created illustrating the change in the hospitalization counts between the two residential groups. we then used harmonic regression to estimate the times to peak for each group, controlled for long-term trends. the terms 3(t) and 4(t2) control for long-term linear and quadratic trends. 29 Oct-Mar 0.138 Alaska 9188 (96.2) 363 (3.8) 7914 (88.5) 1033 (11.6)

those cells would be of much higher counts and rates. the different hues represent rates and the sizes represent counts. residents of certain states have a greater propensity to be treated out-of-state. the non-resident P&I cases in Arizona appear to come from a fairly even distribution of many other states. out-of-state residents being hospitalized in Florida for P&I were derived primarily from northeastern, and Midwestern states. the northernmost states--including Maine, Vermont, North Dakota, and Montana -actually experienced decreases in out-of-state resident P&I hospitalizations during the influenza season compared to the off-season. the top six states provided the majority (53.7%) of all out-of-state cases. states shaded in purple provide more non-resident P&I hospitalizations to Florida during between October and March than between April and September. 1083513 Rhode Island 716 New York 15984 Iowa 620 Michigan 9703 Vermont 593 Ohio 6959 Louisiana 445

alphabetically within Census divisions. adjacent groups of states tend to have the largest discordances between provider state and state of residence for P&I cases. orange dots represent states in which the rates are higher for October-March than for April-September. there were 1,185,543 P&I hospitalizations in Florida between 1991 and 2006. non-floridian patients tended to be younger (79.5 vs. 80.3 years, p 0.001, t-test), more likely male (52.9% male vs. 47.0%, p 0.001, 2 test), and predominately white (94.4% vs. 87.7%, p 0.001, 2 test). the two states that share a border with Florida, Georgia and Alabama provide 8.6% of all non-resident P&I cases. states shaded in green provide more non-resident P&I hospitalizations to Florida during between October and March than between April and September. the percentage of all P&I hospitalizations attributable to out-of-state residents in Florida oscillated between approximately 4% during the seasonal nadirs in the summer months to 13% during the typical wintertime increases. hospitalizations of the out-of-state patients peaked at about the third week of January. the patterns observed in Florida are similar to those observed in other destination states for seasonally migrating elderly, including Texas, California, and Arizona. the top contributors of hospitalized non-residents are not necessarily with the largest proportion of the national elderly population. public health and medical practitioners could use these findings to identify areas where out-of-state elderly visitors may overwhelm the local infrastructures. a major strength of this analysis is the use of CMS data set, which is one of the most complete sources of information on U.S. elderly hospitalization profile. study is among the first to quantify pneumonia and influenza hospitalization patterns in the elderly with respect to seasonal migration in the united states. despite the limitations outlined above, our findings still emphasize the importance to understand more on this non-residential hospitalized elderly population. the study assessed the spatial and temporal components of influenza-associated hospitalizations in the american elderly population. we demonstrated the use of Medicare hospitalizations to quantify the impact of seasonal or temporary migration patterns on the distribution of pneumonia and influenza.
