{"summary": "mosquito-born flaviviruses include dengue virus serotype 1\u20134 (DENV-1-4), yellow fever virus (YFV), west Nile virus (WNV) and japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) are highly pathogenic to humans. these infections have become major international health problems. HCQ and chloroquine were reported to interfere in flavivirus infection at JEV internalization, YFV replication, and DENV maturation. however, in a randomized controlled trial, chloroquine failed to reduce viremia in patients with dengue disease. IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), IRF7, and NFB, thus leading to expression of type I IFN and various cytokines. cytokines inhibit virus replication in infected cells and regulate adaptive immunity, for swift eradication of viruses. the reagents HCQ (Sigma-Aldrich; H0915), Baf A1 (Calbiochem; #196000), and recombinant human IFN- 2a (Prospec; CYT-204) were used. the reagents HCQ (Sigma-Aldrich; H0915), Baf A1 (Calbiochem; #196000), and recombinant human IFN- 2a were used. qPCR amplification involved 3 ng cDNA in 10 L SYBR Green PCR master mix. transcript levels were normalized to that of hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase. the primer sequences for gene detection are in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2. deNV-2 NS3 was detected by incubation with a monoclonal antibody against NS3 (#YH3304, 1:500 dilution; Yao-Hong Biotechnology), plus Alexa Fluor-488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody. fluorescence signals were observed by fluorescence microscopy (ZEISS Observer. A1). acrylamide gel electrophoresis transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. incubated with primary antibody, then horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. images were acquired by using a digital image system, BioSpectrum Image System. A549 cells with shMAVS or control shLacZ stable expression were previously established (Yu and others 2010). for blocking type I IFN receptor signaling, A549 cells were incubated with type I IFN receptor neutralization monoclonal antibody. a549 human lung epithelial carcinoma cells (ATCC: CCL-185), hepa1-6 hepatoma cells (BCRC: 60051), WS1 human fetal skin normal fibroblasts (BCRC: 60300), and HEK-293T cells (ATCC: CRL-3216) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen) cell proliferation and viability assay Cells were assayed with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl) 2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT; Roche) at 1 mg/ml for 4 h. then the cell supernatant was replaced with DMSO to completely resolve the purple formazon crystals. herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter was an internal control. pcDNA3.1 V5-tagged-MAVS was used. cell lysates were collected for dual-luciferase assay. immunoblot analysis Cells were lyzed in RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% NP40, 0.1% SDS, and 50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0]) extracts were separated by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. images were acquired by using a digital image lecular (BiP/GRP78), Calnexin, endoplasmic oxidoreductin1 (Ero1), inositol-requiring protein 1 (IRE1), C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), PKR-like ER protein kinase (PERK) and protein disulfide isomerase. MAVS knockdown efficiency was analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-MAVS antibody. HCQ inhibits DENV-2 infection in vitro. we evaluated the use of HCQ against DENV-2 infection. HCQ dose-dependently reduced DENV-2 infection. hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) attenuates dengue virus infection in vitro. A549, Hepa1-6 and WS-1 cells were pretreated with HCQ as indicated for 24 h before DENV-2 inoculation. immunofluorescent assays of viral titers in deNV-2-infected A549 cells treated with HCQ. Baf A1 is an autophagosome\u2013lysosome fusion modulator with a similar pharmacological effect as HCQ. the anti-DENV-2 activity of Baf A1 is similar to HCQ and the positive control IFN-. HCQ also had antiviral effects against DENV-1, -3, and -4 serotypes. a549 cells were treated with HCQ (50 M) before, during and after viral adsorption. they were mock-infected or infected with DENV-2 for 24 h (b) or pretreated with HCQ for 18 h before DENV-2 infection (c), during DENV-2 adsorption for 2 h (d), or after DENV-2 adsorption for 24 h (e) tripartite motif-containing protein 21 (TRIM21) and major vault protein (MVP) were detected in HCQ-treated murine J774A.1 macrophages. thus, HCQ-controlled DENV-2 infection may be associated with the activation of the host innate immune response. HCQ induced the antiviral genes IFN-, IFIT3, Viperin, and TRAF3 in both A549 and J774A.1 cells. qPCR of mRNA levels normalized to that of the internal control hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) and fold induction over the solvent control (meanSD) qPCR of mRNA levels normalized to that of the internal control hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase. mice were treated with 50 M HCQ or solvent control for 24 h. RT-qPCR of mRNA levels normalized to that of the internal control. HCQ activates cellular signaling of innate immunity. HCQ time-dependently activated NFB by increasing NFB p65 expression and degrading IB. HCQ significantly induced NFB p65 translocation into the nucleus. the pattern was similar with the positive control of polyI:C stimulation. we aimed to confirm whether MAVS is involved in HCQ antiviral activity. HCQ enhanced the MAVS-transactivated IFN--, ISRE-, NFB-, and AP-1-driven luciferase activities. exogenous MAVS expression was higher in HCQ-treated than untreated control A549 cells. HCQ-mediated MAVS mRNA expression was inhibited in shMAVS-A549 cells. HCQ-mediated nuclear translocation of IRF3 and NFB p65 in control cells was downregulated in MAVS knocked-down cells. HCQ enhances mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein expression and its transactivity. deNV-2 infectivity (F) and plaque assay of viral titration (G) of (E) RT-qPCR analysis of MAVS mRNA expression in shLacZ or shMAVS stably expressed A549 cells treated with HCQ (50 M) for 24 h. blocking type I IFN signaling reduces the anti-DENV-2 activity of HCQ. TBK1/IKK inhibitors BX795 (C) and Amlexanox (D) were co-incubated with 30 M HCQ. cells were infected with DENV-2 (MOI=1) for 24 h. HCQ-induced ROS contributes to innate immune activation ROS play an important role in normal cell signaling and homeostasis. promoting a TLR4 signaling pathway to drive cJun/AP-1 and NFB activation. drug-induced oxidative stress in cells has been described. we investigated whether ROS contributes to HCQ-stimulated innate immunity. ROS-inhibited HCQ and HCQ+MAVS-stimulated luciferase reporter activity of IFN-, ISRE, and NFB. our data provide novel insights into the antiviral activity of HCQ mediated by ROS and MAVS involved in the host defense machinery. HCQ induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. data are meanSD (N=3) ***P0.005. HCQ inhibits DENV-2 infection in vitro. HCQ-restricted deNV2 replication was not due to impaired cell proliferation. HCQ inhibited deNV-2 infection in J774A.1 macrophages (IC50=9.71.3 M) A549 cells pretreated with 50 and 100 M HCQ for 24 h were infected with DENV-2 at multiplicity of infection (MOI)=1. anti-NS3 (green fluorescence) and DAPI (blue florescence) stained images were merged to show DENV-infected cells, and quantification. IFA of DENV-2 infectivity revealed that HCQ pretreatment suppressed DENV-2 infection. DENV-2 replication was only partially reduced with HCQ added during virus adsorption or after viral adsorption. long-term HCQ treatment may have better inhibition effect on DENV-2 replication. HCQ induces the expression of host antiviral genes Type I IFN and associated antiviral proteins play crucial roles in host innate immunity. we found high induction of several innate immunity genes in human A549 cells treated with a high dose of HCQ.

HCQ dose-dependently increased IFN-, NFB and AP-1 reporter activity. HCQ significantly induced NFB p65 translocation into the nucleus. luciferase reporters transfected with Luc reporter (0.2 g) and pRL-TK (0.02 g) treated with HCQ for 24 h at indicated doses. data are meanSD from 3 independent tests. RT-qPCR confirmed the MAVS knockdown efficiency by shRNA. HCQ-mediated MAVS mRNA expression was inhibited in shMAVS-A549 cells. HCQ-mediated nuclear translocation of IRF3 and NFB p65 in control cells was downregulated. Luc reporter (0.5 g) and pRL-TK (0.04 g), plus empty vector or pcDNA3.1-V5-MAVS (0.8 g) treated with HCQ (50 M) for 24 h. RT-qPCR analysis of MAVS mRNA expression in shLacZ or shMAVS stably expressed A549 cells. deNV-2 infectivity and titration data indicated reduced efficiency of HCQ against DENV-2 in cells with blocked type I IFN signaling. blocking type I IFN signaling reduced HCQ inhibition efficiency. HCQ also inhibited ADE-mediated DENV-2 infection in J774A.1 macrophages. TBK1/IKK inhibitors BX795 (C) and Amlexanox (D) were co-incubated with 30 M HCQ. cells were infected with DENV-2 (MOI=1) for 24 h. HCQ-induced ROS contributes to innate immune activation ROS play an important role in normal cell signaling and homeostasis. phosphorylated c-Jun level, with IB degradation; so, ROS was involved in the innate immune signaling pathway. we used a nonspecific ROS scavenger, PBN (Fidanboylu and others 2011) to globally decrease cellular ROS level. HCQ-restricted DENV-2 infectivity was attenuated with PBN. A549 cells (2104) were pretreated with 10 mM N-tert-Butyl-(-phenylnitrone) for 2 h, then HCQ (50 M) for 24 h. data are meanSD (N=6) *P0.05; ***P0.005. HCQ induced the expression of antiviral factors such as IFN-, IFIT3, CXCL-10, Viperin, MDA-5, MAVS, TRAF3, and TRIM21. blocking the type I IFN pathway with an anti-IFN-/ receptor antibody and TBK1/IKK inhibitors reduced HCQ anti-DENV activity. elucidating whether HCQ promotes post-translational modification of signaling proteins to regulate innate immune responses would be of interest. HCQ enhanced the expression of IRE1 of the ER stress pathway but not immunoglobulin heavy chain-BiP/GRP78. HCQ and CQ are weak basic drugs that accumulate in the acidic environment of cellular organelles to inhibit replication of different viruses by interfering with endosome/lysosome trafficking or viral protein maturation during virion maturation. HCQ and CQ are well-known autophagy pathway inhibitors. protein 3 (NALP3) inhibits ROS-mediated inflammtory cytokine expression. autophagy also inhibits MAVS aggregation to downregulate type I IFN production. the detailed role of autophagy in virus replication remains to be validated. the late stage of interference in virion maturation might not be the major mechanism of HCQ anti-DENV-2 activity. HCQ preventive treatment in the area or season of a dengue pandemic might be a feasible strategy to reduce the severity and spread of DENV outbreak."}
