{"summary": "the sudden emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in April 2003 has seen a diminution of the media publicity and overt public concern. but fears have recently surfaced about the potential for re-emergence of SARS in the near future. this is an appropriate time to reflect on the ethical values that underlay strict visitation restrictions imposed in hospitals in Ontario during the outbreak. in a health care institution, visitation restrictions affect inpatients. they have an impact on ambulatory patients who must come for diagnostic tests or interventions. they are likely to cause distress, anxiety and increased complaints. they should be managed with sensitivity and clarity. the policy must be made accessible, printed and broadly circulated throughout the hospital so that people understand the rules, the rationale for those rules and how to appeal in special circumstances. the development of criteria for exceptionality must recognize the need for proportionality, ensuring that criteria are'relevant, legitimate and necessary... and should be applied without discrimination' the organization must accept responsibility for making rules and communicating them to all staff, patients and visitors. it is not the responsibility of staff, whose primary responsibility is to discharge the duty of care to the patient. the organization also has the responsibility of developing a set of criteria outlining exceptionality and a process to receive, review and adjudicate requests. the ideal situation would be a consistent global approach to the management of each and every contagious pathogen. the notion of universal management strategies is very sensible (e.g. universal precautions with blood-borne conditions such as HIV), but a standardized approach is not possible. there may be circumstances that would require deviation from the corporate position. author has declared no competing interests."}
