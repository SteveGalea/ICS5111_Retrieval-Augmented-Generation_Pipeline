{"summary": "quantitative real-time PCR (QPCR) is an invaluable tool for the measurement of target nucleic acid sequences in clinical diagnostics and research. the technique is capable of the relative or absolute quantification of RNA or DNA sequences in a single sample over a large dynamic range with extreme sensitivity and accuracy. the sensitivity and accuracy of results obtained by QPCR are dependent on a reliable reference within each sample to normalise for sample to sample and run variation. studies have been carried out to determine reliable housekeeping genes in cells infected with a variety of viruses. this is especially the case when investigating the effects of viruses on host cell gene expression as viruses interfere with host cell pathways. these include cell cycle, metabolism, DNA replication and transcription, in order to aid their replication cycle [9-11]. 18sRNA was the least reliable reference gene as it had the highest sumv value (13.26). lycerate kinase 1 (PGK1), and BACT also had high sumv values of 10.51 and 9.65 respectively. most reliable overall reference gene was PP1A with a sumv value of 7.41. in the context of HSV-1NC1 infected HELA cells EEF1G was identified as the least reliable gene. in the case of CMV an almost identical pattern in reliability was observed in infected primary HFF cells regardless of differences in the virus strain used. a very similar pattern was also seen in VZVSchenke infected cells despite differences in the origin of the primary cell types used for infection.
