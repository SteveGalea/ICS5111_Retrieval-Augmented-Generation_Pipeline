{"summary": "Resequencing Pathogen Microarray has demonstrated potential for differential diagnosis of several respiratory pathogens simultaneously. but a high confidence design method to select probes for genetically diverse viruses is lacking. a minimal number of probe sequences were determined and implemented on the Resequencing Pathogen Microarray RPM-Flu v.30/31. diverse viruses, i.e. influenza A virus, human rhinoviruses (HRV), and human enteroviruses (HEV) need to be detected for successful differential diagnosis. a high-density resequencing microarray platform, the RPM v.1 platform, has been successfully demonstrated to identify a much broader range of pathogens. 5'UTR sequence chosen for HRV on the RPM v.1 only provided identification of the prototype HRV-89 and very little coverage of other HRV serotypes. the 5'UTR sequences still have 5 to 30% nucleotide sequence variations among different serotypes so require more than one prototype sequence. new resequencing pathogen microarray designs have been constructed to address the shortcomings of the previous design. using 15% of the RPM-Flu v.30/31 microarray is sufficient to detect and differentiate many HRV and HEV serotypes. sequences that contain the specified target region (5'UTR) and meet any selection criteria applied were downloaded from a database (currently GenBank). sequences that contain the specified target region (5'UTR) and meet any selection criteria applied were downloaded from a database (currently GenBank) the predicted base calls were assembled into a simulated microarray result. each sequence is treated as probe sequence that the other sequences are tested against. a sequence was considered detected by the current prototype sequence if at least one region of 50 contiguous nucleotides was predicted to consist of A, C, G, and T base calls. the sequence that was predicted to detect the most other sequences (as targets) was selected as a probe sequence to be used in the microarray design. all the target sequences detected by that prototype sequence were also removed from the list of sequences. 34 known HRV serotype strains from ATCC were tested. of the 34 strains, 18 had corresponding 5'UTR sequences tiled on the microarray. the remaining 16 strains, representing near neighbor serotypes, were selected. the phylogenetic tree derived from the de novo 5'UTR sequences confirms the HRVA and HRVB classification. the maximum nucleotide divergences among HRVA and HRVB strains were 33.4% and 32.7%, respectively. sequence calls and analysis software, CIBSI [22], allows for straightforward serotype identification. the identifications made by RPM-Flu v.30/31 and CIBSI are consistent with the reported typing. of the 34 HRV strains, 18 matched the selected prototype 5' UTR sequences on the RPM-Flu v.30/31 chips and showed strong hybridization signals to their prototype regions. a base is misidentified by the resequencing microarray where n is the number of mismatches between the next best hit and the matches for the best result. for HRV5, several database sequences representing different serotypes had the same score and since no further information was available it was only possible to determine that a HRV species B was present.

HRV serotypes were identified using microarray, de novo sequencing, and in silico model of de novo sequence results. suspect there was a processing error or sample degradation leading to the less accurate identification.

Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) was replaced by GoTaq\u00ae DNA polymerase (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI) in the multiplex PCR reaction. the amplification reaction was carried out in a Peltier Thermal Cycler \u2013 PTC240 DNA Engine Tetrad 2. for the RPM-Flu v.30/31 assay was performed using computer-Implemented Biological Sequence Identifier (CIBSI) version 2.0 software. the automatic pathogen identification algorithm based on nucleic acid sequence alignment was developed and tested in detail in previous studies. primer design All 5'UTR sequences of HRV and HEV with approximately 750 bp sizes were downloaded from GenBank. potential PCR primer pairs that are able to amplify 600 \u2013 700 bp fragments from HRV and HEV were automatically selected by a perl script primer search program. GCOS software was used to reduce the raw image (.DAT) file to a simplified file format (.CEL file) with intensities assigned to each of the probe positions. sequences from base calls made for each tiled region of the resequencing microarray were exported from GDAS as the FASTA-formatted files. phylogenetic analysis of 5'UTR sequences was performed by using neighbor-joining method in MEGA software. all nucleotide sequences used in this study are available at GenBank (accession nos.
