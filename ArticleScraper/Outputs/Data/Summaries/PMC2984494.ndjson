{"summary": "mutations of SLC26A4 are worldwide among the most prevalent causes of deafness [1], [2], [3], [4]. the compatibility of SLC26A4 mutations with hearing, although limited to early childhood, provides the imperative to investigate the etiology of SLC26A4 related deafness. diagram based on a cochlea obtained from an E18.5 Slc26a4+/ mouse. Abbreviations: C, otic capsule; S, stria vascularis; H, sensory hair cells; M, modiolus; N, cochlear nerve. spaces occupied by mesenchymal cell are compressed in Slc26a4/ mice. the enlargement of scala media is a key event in the etiology of deafness. the enlargement is due to a dysfunction of epithelial fluid transport. pendrin does not mediate net solute transport, since it transports anions with a stoichiometry of 11. a colony of Slc26a4/ and Slc26a4+/ mice was maintained at Kansas State University. pairs of Slc26a4+/ dams and Slc26a4+/ sires were housed together. the gestational period was 21 days. pulmonis (Mycoplasma pulmonis), MPV (a mouse parvovirus), Parvo NS-1 (a conserved recombinant parvoviral protein, rNS1) and Sendai (Sendai virus \u2013 a type 1 paramyxovirus) were deeply anesthetized with 4% tri-bromo-ethanol and sacrificed by decapitation. otocysts were isolated in sterile solution maintained at 4\u00b0C. NaCl solution contained 150 NaCl, 5 HEPES, 3.6 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2 and 5 glucose, pH 7.4. one otocyst from each embryo was left intact or altered. fetal bovine serum (Cat# 30-2020, ATCC, Waldorf, MD) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Cat# 30-2020, ATCC, Waldorf, MD) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Cat# 15140-122, Invitrogen) incubated at 37\u00b0C in humidified atmosphere enriched with 5% CO2 (HeraCell 240, Heraeus, Germany) slides were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with primary antibody (rabbit anti-Na+/K+ ATPase 1 alpha subunit, Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO) diluted 1200 with PBS-TX containing 1\u20133% BSA. slides were washed three times with PBS-TX, cover-slipped with FluorSave. c26a4+/ and Slc26a4/ mice ranging from E11.5 to P7 were housed together. genetic drift was limited by occasional back-crossing to the original strain 129SvEvTac. otocysts were isolated in sterile NaCl solution maintained at 4\u00b0C. otocysts were left intact or altered either by ligation of the vestibular labyrinth or by resection of the endolymphatic sac. otocysts were isolated and tied at the base of the cochlea with a braided silk surgical suture. the vestibular part of the otocyst, including the endolymphatic sac, was cut away from the isolated cochlear preparation. in another set of experiments, the endolymphatic sac was removed by resection. otocysts were processed through a sucrose gradient (10% and 20%, each 20 min, followed by 30% overnight, all at 4\u00b0C), infiltrated with polyethylene glycol (Cat# 72592-B, Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA) serial sections throughout the entire cochlea were obtained from embryos between ages E11.5 and E14.5 and from neonates aged P3. sections mounted on charged slides were blocked for 1 hr with 5% slides were washed three times with PBS-TX, cover-slipped with FluorSave. the size of the cochlear lumen was evaluated by digital area measurements using image analysis software. stria vascularis began to differentiate from a monolayer to the multi-layered architecture including the characteristic vascularization. stria vascularis began to differentiate from a monolayer to the multi-layered architecture including the characteristic vascularization. the cochlear lumen increased with development in Slc26a4+/ and Slc26a4+/ mice. the ratio between the luminal size in Slc26a4+/ and Slc26a4/ increased from factor 6 at E16.5 to factor 12 at E18.5. numbers next to symbols represent the N number of Slc26a4+/ and Slc26a4/ littermates. fluid secretion in the vestibular labyrinth \u2018pumps up\u2019 the cochlea. Embryonic inner ears were harvested at E14.5. fluid secretion in the vestibular labyrinth \u2018pumps up\u2019 the cochlea during lumen formation. ligation was found to be transient and was found to be lost at E17.5. cochlear cross-sections were imaged by laser-scanning microscopy. arrows point to the two basal cross-sections, which were used for digital area measurements. the endolymphatic sac was removed in this series of experiments to avoid variations due to injury of this extremely fragile structure. the observed enlargement in Slc26a4/ suggests that loss of Slc26a4 expression impairs fluid absorption in the endolymphatic sac. this control is transient and found to be lost at E17.5. cochlear cross-sections were imaged by laser-scanning microscopy. inner ears ranging from embryonic (E) day E12.5 to postnatal (P) day P3 were sectioned and examined by confocal microscopy. six different stages of development ranging from E12.5 to P3 are shown. abbreviations: SV, stria vascularis; OS, outer sulcus; K, K\u00f6lliker's organ; RM, Reissner's membrane; Ca, otic capsule; SL, spiral ligament. cochlear cross-sections of E14.5 Slc26a4+/ and Slc26a4/ littermates. the number next to the bars represents the N number of animals. bular labyrinth contributes to cochlear lumen formation. Embryonic inner ears were harvested at E14.5, which is at the onset of lumen formation. the endolymphatic sac was removed and the cochlea was separated from the vestibular labyrinth by ligation. cochleae were harvested at E14.5 and E17.5 from Slc26a4+/ and Slc26a4/ mice. the number next to bars represents the N number of animals. significant differences are marked (*) Embryonic inner ears were again harvested at E14.5 and E17.5. great care was taken to not injure the endolymphatic sac during dissection. the endolymphatic sac was then removed by manual resection. cochleae were harvested at E14.5 and E17.5 from Slc26a4+/ and Slc26a4/ mice and maintained two days in organ culture. the number next to the bars represents the N number of animals. the inner ear develops from an invagination of the ectoderm that forms a vesicular otocyst. at E10.5, two protrusions begin to extend from the otocyst. the center of the otocyst reorganizes into the vestibular labyrinth. in the postnatal cochlea, pendrin is expressed in sheets of transitional cells. a reduction in fluid absorption in the endolymphatic sac presents a conceivable reason for the enlargement of the cochlear lumen. this view is supported by the finding that resection of the endolymphatic sac led to an enlargement similar to that observed in Slc26a4+/ mice. the heterogenic epithelium of the endolymphatic sac resembles a frog skin. it is comprised of principal cells equipped with apical Na+ channels. mitochondria-rich cells equipped with an apical H+ ATPase and a Cl/HCO3 exchanger. the loss of control of cochlea fluid homeostasis by the endolymphatic sac may be the result of the maturation of local cochlear fluid homeostasis. the capacity for Na+ reabsorption in the endolymphatic sac may be higher at E14.5 than at E17. ligation of the vestibular labyrinth led to a reduction in the cochlear lumen. pendrin does not play a major role in fluid secretion in the embryonic labyrinth. enlargement may disrupt cell-to-cell signaling necessary for hearing development. the enlargement of the cochlea lumen in mice displaces mesenchymal cells. thereby disrupts cell signaling, which leads to local cochlear hypothyroidism. the enlargement appears to disrupt critical cell-to-cell signaling mechanisms. a lack of functional Slc26a4 expression leads to a failure of fluid absorption in the endolymphatic sac that initiate cochlear enlargement in mice, and possibly humans. this study demonstrates that a lack of functional Slc26a4 expression leads to a failure of fluid absorption in the endolymphatic sac. tif)"}
