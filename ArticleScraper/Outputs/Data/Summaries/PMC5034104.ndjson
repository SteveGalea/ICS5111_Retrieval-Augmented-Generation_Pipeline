{"summary": "more than 50 mAbs have been approved or are under review for human use. several hundred are currently being tested in the clinic,1 most of them to treat patients suffering from a variety of cancers or inflammatory diseases. employing mAbs as antiviral drugs is under consideration for treatment of several chronic and acute severe viral infections. most antiviral mAbs in use are immunoglobulin (Ig)-Gs. different types of FcRs are expressed in a regulated manner by many cells of the immune system. recognition of mAbs can entail antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis. antiviral mAbs can opsonize viruses, as well as infected cells. this can lead to viral clearance through various immune-mediated mechanisms. the Fc domain allows the binding of complement to free virions. infected cells can also be eliminated by complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) and/or antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) mediated by innate immunity effector cells expressing study focuses on induction of antiviral immune responses by ICs in passive immunotherapies and vaccination strategies. potential deleterious effects of antiviral antibodies on host immune dysfunction are also discussed. antiviral immune response is recognized by the FcRs expressed by DCs. an Fc-mediated effect occurs concurrently is the inhibition of regulatory T-cell expansion. this depends on the mAb effector functions45 and occurs rapidly. the administration of highly neutralizing antibodies (either mAbs or polyclonal Igs) enhanced both the humoral and cellular antiviral immune responses of treated animals. however, it is unknown whether these antiviral responses have genuine protective vaccine-like effects. in vitro studies have addressed whether antibody-mediated viral uptake by DCs could lead to stronger activation of these cells and the development of stronger virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses in an Fc-dependent manner. this increase in the cellular immune response has been reported in different infectious settings using ICs made with different types of antigens. ICs made up of anti-HBV mAbs and the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) can affect DC function and enhance T-cell responses. the therapeutic efficacy of HBsAg/anti-HBV ICs has been tested in clinical trials in patients with encouraging results. the administration of DCs loaded with HBsAg/anti-HBV ICs to mice increased the number of IFN-- and tumor necrosis factor---producing CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. in an SIV infection setting, the incubation of APCs with ICs made with a recombinant full-length Gag p55 protein and an anti-p55 IgG increased SIV capsid cross-presentation. the nature of the viral determinant present in ICs might also be crucial in the stimulation of antiviral responses. this is explained by the fact the FrCasE-GagL immunodominant epitope is poorly incorporated into virions. ICs formed with endogenous antibodies generated in virally infected mice have been shown to influence antiviral cellular immune responses in several models. the highly neutralizing humoral response generated against the FrCasE retrovirus in mAb-treated-infected mice was demonstrated to limit the viral propagation. anti-LCMV antibodies limited viral replication in peripheral organs, but allowed replication of the virus in the marginal zone of the spleen, promoting CD8+ T-cell priming. Interestingly, anti-LCMV antibodies were also reported to be essential for long-term maintenance of the memory CTL response in infected mice. the immunostimulatory are principally attributed to the ability of Fc antibody fragments to recruit the host immune system. however, evidence also implicates Fab fragments in modulation of the antiviral immune response. we describe the enhancement in antiviral immune responses observed in IC-based vaccination experiments. duck HBsAg and rabbit anti-duck HBsAg (DHBsAg/anti-DHB) were used as immunogens in the form of solid matrix\u2013antibody\u2013antigen complexes (SMAAs) such SMAAs contained killed Staphylococcus aureus as a solid matrix and mAb-ops. onized viruses were initially shown to induce humoral and CTL responses against the paramyxovirus simian virus 5 in immunized mice. the administration of DHBsAg/anti-DHB ICs lacking Staphylococcus aureus showed decreased immunization efficiency, suggesting that the bacteria-based solid matrix functions as an adjuvant. a therapeutic vaccine composed of yeast-derived recombinant HBsAg/anti-HBV immunogenic complexes (YICs) has been tested in a series of clinical trials. this approach was initially shown to induce higher titers of HBsAg antibodies, as well as to increase serum IFN- and IL-2 levels in subsequent phase II trials. YIC decreased the vaccine efficiency due to host immune fatigue. this suggests that vaccination protocols must be optimized and must take into account both the nature and the dose of ICs. compared with free antigen, recall immunization with ICs induced stronger T-cell responses through uncharacterized mechanisms. immunization with ICs is dictated by the nature of the antigen, as well as the specificity and affinity of the mAbs used. the results indicate the potential contribution of Fab-mediated activities in the enhancement of antiviral humoral responses by ICs. mouse studies have revealed potential antibody-induced neonatal autoimmunity in certain settings. 86 HBV ICs have been tested as vaccines to increase protective immune responses in different animal models of HBV infection. the administration of HBsAg/anti-HBV ICs to HBsAg-positive transgenic mice decreased the serum HBsAg levels and induced stronger CTL responses than HBsAg alone. a similar effect was reported in a woodchuck model of HBV infection. a subpopulation of chronic viral hepatitis B patients showed a decrease in serum HBV viral load and HBsAg levels together with an increase in anti-HBsAg antibody titers in subsequent phase II trials. recent data showing that the administration of YIC-loaded DCs to mice increased both CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell responses63 suggest that the improved immune responses induced by YICs might account for the antiviral effect observed in a fraction of patients the interaction of the anti-CD4-binding site mAb with HIV-1 gp120 induced conformational changes in the latter. further improvement in the immunogenicity of the V3 loop was obtained in ICs generated with gp120 mutants lacking site-specific N-linked glycans. ICs made with the commercial mAb palivizumab could influence adaptive immune response priming after intranasal administration. substantial anti-RSV T-cell priming and B-cell responses were observed in mice receiving RSV-ICs. this resulted in predominant Th1-type CD4+ T-cell response and IgG2c antibody responses. the composition of ICs has been shown to be dynamic throughout the course of HIV infections due to changes in both antibody specificities and virion levels. circulating ICs are initially comprised of antibodies that opsonize both infectious and non-infectious virions. this phenomenon probably contributes to the reduced efficiency of the antibodies generated during acute infection. this may have been due to the activation of a DC\u2013T-cell axis. this induces the activation of CD4+ T cells and leads to a permissive environment for HIV-1 infection. several approaches can be considered to enhance the immunomodulatory potential of antiviral mAbs, both alone and in the form of ICs. antiviral mAbs are widely accepted, and their use as antiviral drugs is increasingly under consideration. the improvement in humoral and cellular responses achieved through the administration of mAbs, either free or in form of immunogenic ICs, offers new therapeutic options."}
