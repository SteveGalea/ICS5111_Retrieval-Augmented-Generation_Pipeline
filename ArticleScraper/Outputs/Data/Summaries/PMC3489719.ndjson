{"summary": "administration of soluble protein antigens, inactivated viruses, or virus-like particles has been shown to induce broad immune responses in mucosal and extra-mucosal tissues. s.l. immunization with rADV-S induces protective immunity against SARS-CoV and could serve as a safe mucosal route for delivery of rADV. infects the airways should elicit immune responses in the mucosa of the respiratory tract. i.n. delivery of vaccines has been selected as an attractive alternative to injection. concerns about its safety have been raised following reports of unacceptable neurological side-effects associated with retrograde transport of antigens or adjuvants. s.l. administration of rAd5 vectors encoding HIV proteins induced significant antigen-specific humoral [32] and cellular immune responses. s.l. route is suitable for rADV vaccines. 293 cells were infected with rADV-S at 20 multiplicity of infection (MOI) for 48 hrs. a specific 120 kDa protein band corresponding to the predicted size of the S protein was observed in rADV-S infected 293 cells but not in rADV-EGFP infected cells. immunized s.l., i.n., or i.m. each group of BALB/c mice three times 14 days apart with either 2 107 or 1 108 plaque-forming unit (PFU) of rADV-S. igG titers were detected as soon as 2 weeks after each immunization regardless of delivery route. significant level of IgA specific for SARS-S protein was observed in BAL of s.l. immunized mice 2 weeks after the third immunization. we examined whether s.l. immunization with rADV-S induces nAbs. i.n. and s.l. immunization routes induced significantly higher percentages of SARS S-specific CD8+ T cells in the lungs. i.n. and s.l. immunization routes induced significantly higher percentages of IFN--producing CD8+ T cells in the lung. s.l. and i.n. administrations of rADV-S are equally efficient in induction of CD8+ T cell responses in the lungs. the results clearly demonstrate that s.l. and i.n. administrations of rADV-S are equally efficient in induction of CD8+ T cell responses in the lungs. rADV-EGFP was detected in all s.l. immunized mice. DNA was purified from the lungs and olfactory bulbs by using DNeasy tissue kit. results were determined by PCR as described in Materials and Methods. gene encoding codon-optimized SARS-S protein without helical regions, transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic domain was inserted into pShuttle vector to construct the rADV expressing the SARS-S protein. the protein was purified by His-tag affinity chromatography and detected by Western blot. s.l. immunization with rADV-S induces antigen-specific Ab in the lungs. groups of 6 mice each were immunized three times 2 weeks apart with rADV-S. two weeks after the third immunization sera were collected and analyzed for SARS-CoV neutralization using microneutralization assay. all immunization routes induced significant levels of nAbs. the endpoint titers of nAbs are far above the titer of 1/35 that is considered to be protective in mice. i.n. and s.l. immunization routes induced lower percentages of SARS S-specific CD8+ T cell and IFN--producing CD8+ T cell in the spleens. i.n. and s.l. immunization routes induced lower percentages of IFN--producing CD8+ T cells in the lungs. s.l. administration of rADV resulted in virus migration to the olfactory bulb. 1 108 PFU of rADV were administered either intranasally or sublingually. twenty-four hours later, the olfactory bulbs were collected. s.l. immunization induced immune responses in respiratory tracts and systemic compartments. rADV-S induced significant immune responses in respiratory tracts and systemic compartments. s.l. immunization induced nAb titers above 1/35 that is considered protective in mice. s.l. and i.n. immunizations of rADV-S induced higher levels of SARS-CoV S-specific CD8 T cell responses in the lung than that of i.m. immunization. the findings are in consistence with other studies showing that rADV expressing S protein could induce cellular immune responses. s.l. delivery of rADV-S could induce systemic IgG and airway IgA nAb as well as CD8+ T cell responses in mice. s.l. delivery of rADV-S could induce systemic IgG and airway IgA nAb as well as CD8+ T cell responses in mice. s.l. immunization with rADV-S offers a novel safe and effective vaccination strategy to combat SARS-CoV. the ectodomain (amino acids 14\u2013891) of the SARS-CoV S protein lacking the transmembrane domain was codon-optimized for high-level expression in mammalian cells. the resulting construct was transfected into T-Rex-293 cells (Invitrogen) by electroporation to achieve homologous recombination. the purified viruses were extensively dialyzed against 10 mM Tris, 5% sucrose, 2 mM MgCl2. mice were immunized with rADV-S 2 107 PFU in 100 l phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), i.n. or s.l. with rADV-S 2 107 or 1 108 PFU in 20 l of PBS. mice were immunized three times at 2-week intervals. a group of six BALB/c mice were immunized s.l., i.n., or i.m. with rADV-S three times at 2-week intervals. blood was collected from the retro-orbital plexus 2 weeks after each immunization, followed by incubation at room temperature for 30 min. 100 l of 2-fold serial dilution of samples in blocking buffer were added to each well. the reaction was stopped by adding 0.5 N HCl. the endpoint titer was determined by O.D. cut-off values of 0.2. complexes were enzymatically biotinylated by BirA ligase. tetramers were stored at 5 mg/ml in PBS (pH 8.0) containing 0.02% sodium azide, 1 g/ml pepstatin, 1 g/ml leupeptin and 0.5 mM EDTA at 4\u00b0C. mice were resuspended in complete IMDM at a concentration of 1 107 cells/ml. a total of 100 l of these cells (1 106 cells) were stained for CD8 (clone 53\u20136.7), CD44 (clone IM7), and Kd/SARS-CoV tetramer. the PCR products were loaded on 1% agarose gel. rADV expressing SARS-CoV S protein was codon-optimized for high-level expression in mammalian cells. a tetracycline-regulated expression system was adopted. the resulting construct was transfected into T-Rex-293 cells (Invitrogen) by the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method. the purified viruses were extensively dialyzed against 10 mM Tris, 5% sucrose, 2 mM MgCl2. mice were immunized with rADV-S 2 107 PFU in 100 l phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), i.n. or s.l. with rADV-S 2 107 or 1 108 PFU in 20 l of PBS. mice were immunized three times at 2-week intervals. a group of six BALB/c mice were immunized s.l., i.n. or i.m. with rADV-S three times at 2-week intervals. blood was collected from the retro-orbital plexus 2 weeks after each immunization, followed by incubation at room temperature for 30 min. 100 l of 2-fold serial dilution of samples in blocking buffer were added to each well and incubated for 1 hr at 37\u00b0C. the reaction was stopped by adding 0.5 N HCl. the absorbance at wavelength 450 nm was recorded by a microplate reader. inylation site fusion and human 2-microglobulin were expressed in E. coli. they were solubilized and refolded in the presence of corresponding CYGVSATKL (S366-374) SARS-CoV peptide, a major CD8+ T cell epitope. complexes were then enzymatically biotinylated by BirA ligase. a total of 100 l of these cells (1 106 cells) were stained for CD8 (clone 53\u20136.7), CD44 (clone IM7), and Kd/SARS-CoV tetramer. the cells were stained with PE-conjugated anti-IFN- (XMG1.2) (rat IgG1). PCR products were loaded on 1% agarose gel. a P value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. authors declare that they have no conflict of interest."}
