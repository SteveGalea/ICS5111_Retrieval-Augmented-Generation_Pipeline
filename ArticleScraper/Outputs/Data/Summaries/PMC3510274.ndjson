{"summary": "lysosomal enzyme N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase (GlcNAc-1-phosphotransfer-ase)1 is involved in the first step of synthesis of the mannose 6-phosphate signal. this allows specific targeting of lysosomal acid hydrolase from the trans-Golgi network to lysosomes2-4. affected lysosomes are secondarily deficient in most acid hydrolases ML II presents between 6 and 12 months of age with a clinical phenotype resembling that of Hurler syndrome. however, we recently encountered a rare case of ML II in which the patient exhibited intrauterine skeletal abnormalities and typical clinical features with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism at birth. flat midface, broad and depressed nasal bridge, long philtrum, prominent mouth, and gingival hypertrophy are evident. shallow orbits, thick skin, and full cheeks contribute to the appearance of deep infraorbital creases. a wrist radiograph showed diffuse osteopenia and diaphyseal cloaking at both humeri. distal metaphyses of the forearm bones showed cupping. stippling at the tali was found on the infantogram. inine ratio was 0.10 (reference range, 0.03 to 0.9), and the urinary P/Cr ratio was 1.25 (reference range, 0.39 to 5.6). a secundum atrial septal defect (2.8 mm), a small muscular ventricular septal defect (1.5 mm), and a patent ductus arteriosus (3.35 mm) were detected on an echocardiogram. tal biopsy specimen revealed foamy vacuolar changes in trophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts. c.3091C>T mutation was inherited from the father. c.3456_3459dupCAAC mutation was inherited from the mother. the alfacalcidol dose was raised to 0.375 mcg once daily. although the patient appeared to be well, she died from asphyxia at 2 months of age. skeletal radiographs revealed dysostosis multiplex and were similar to findings in rickets. a skull radiograph revealed under-ossification of the calvarium, osteopenia of the mandible with loss of the lamina dura, and premature synostosis of the metopic suture. a wrist radiograph shows diffuse osteopenia, diaphyseal cloaking at both humeri and cupping in the distal metaphyses of the forearm bones. total serum calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) were within the normal ranges (9.5 mg/dL and 5.8 mg/dL, respectively), but alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) were markedly elevated (663 IU/L a small muscular ventricular septal defect (1.5 mm) and a patent ductus arteriosus (3.35 mm) were detected on an echocardiogram. stromal hypoplasia of both irises was discovered. nasal flaring, subcostal retraction, and mild desaturation began on the seventh day of life. the patient was treated with vitamin D supplements from the fifth day of life. after discharge, her ALP level increased to 1,071 IU/L on the 12th day of life. there were 3 cases of ML II, 3 cases of ML III, and 1 case of ML that was not classified. the most common disorders associated with fetal skeletal dysplasia were osteogenesis imperfect (18%), thanatophoric dysplasia (14%), campomelic dysplasia (6%), and achondrogenesis type II (5%). in that report, 8 patients were diagnosed with ML II. the etiology of severe secondary hyperparathyroidism in fetuses and newborns with ML II is uncertain. however, it is speculated that the enzyme-targeting defect in ML II involves trophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts in the placenta. this interferes with transplacental Ca transport and leads to Ca starvation of the fetus and activation of the parathyroid response to maintain extracellular c.3091C>T mutation is novel. severe cases of ML II can present earlier as prenatal skeletal dysplasia and neonatal severe secondary hyperparathyroidism."}
