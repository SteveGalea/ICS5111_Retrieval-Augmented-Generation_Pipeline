{"summary": "infected and uninfected vero E6 cells were harvested 3\u20135 days after inoculation, inactivated by fixation and gamma irradiation (2 106 rad) for standard EM, glutaraldehyde- and osmium tetroxide\u2013fixed specimens were embedded in Epon-substitute and Araldite (Ted Pella, Inc., Redding, CA) sections were stained with uranyl the nucleocapsid riboprobe would detect all viral RNAs. sections were reacted with a pool of nucleocapsid and polymerase probes. a sheep anti-digoxigenin antibody conjugated to 6-nm colloidal gold particles. cross-sections through the helical nucleocapsid were seen apposed to the viral envelope. virions formed mostly spherical, sometimes pleomorphic, particles that averaged 78 nm in diameter. surface projections were faint in standard thin-section preparations. tubular structures, averaging 20 nm in diameter, were seen within some virion-containing vesicles. the vesicles appeared to migrate toward the cell surface and fuse with the plasma membrane, releasing the viral particles. large, ill-defined areas of cytoplasm were noted in some SARS-CoV\u2013infected cells. no antigens or RNA were detected by reacting hyperimmune mouse ascitic fluid or riboprobes with uninfected Vero E6 cells. double-membrane vesicles are nucleocapsid inclusions. at the periphery of the double-membrane vesicles are nucleocapsid inclusions. arrows point to discernable nucleocapsids. a bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL) from a patient with severe acute respiratory syndrome was seen. virions budded into, and were associated with, vesicles. area of double-membrane vesicles containing a diffuse granular material were also seen. surface projections were faint in standard thin-section preparations. tannic acid pre-treatment enhanced the visibility of viral projections. virions in vesicles appeared to migrate toward and fuse with plasma membrane. tubular structures, averaging 20 nm in diameter, were seen within some virion-containing vesicles. the vesicles appeared to migrate toward the cell surface and fuse with the plasma membrane, releasing the viral particles. many of the particles adhered to the plasma membrane, releasing the viral particles. no antigens or RNA were detected by reacting hyperimmune mouse ascitic fluid or riboprobes with uninfected Vero E6 cells. no antigens or RNA were detected by reacting an unrelated hyperimmune mouse ascitic fluid or riboprobe with SARS-CoV\u2013infected cells. at the periphery of the double-membrane vesicles are nucleocapsid inclusions. arrows point to discernable nucleocapsids (small arrows) a bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL) from a patient with severe acute respiratory syndrome shows numerous cytoplasmic and extracellular virions. at higher magnification, double-membrane vesicles (arrow) are shown to contain diffuse, granular material. a virus was isolated from human patients and identified by EM as belonging to the family Coronaviridae (6,7). s are known to synthesize a nested set of subgenomic mRNAs. the nucleocapsid riboprobe used here allowed detection of all viral mRNAs in addition to genRNA. additional cytoplasmic features were associated with SARS-CoV\u2013infected cells. coronavirus particles may be confused morphologically with other nonviral structures routinely found in cells, including coated vesicles, multivesicular bodies, perichromatin granules, glycocalyceal bodies, and cellular projections. a cautious approach is advisable when examining clinical specimens."}
