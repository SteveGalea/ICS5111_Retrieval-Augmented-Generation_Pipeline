{"summary": "licorice flavonoid glycoside extracted from licorice root has multiple functions (1\u20133) it can scavenge free radicals, have anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory, antiviral and anti-ulcer effects and protect cytochrome enzymes as an antioxidant (1\u20136) glycyrrhizin can regulate the secretion of various cytokines and the functioning of immunomodulatory effects in the central nervous system (6,7). in total, 160 healthy adult male BALB/c mice (weighing 252 g) were housed and fed in Xi\u2019an Tianxingjian Natural Bio-products Group (Xi\u2019an, Shaanxi, China) the animal experiments were approved by Jilin University Ethics Committee. glycyrrhizin was dissolved in 0.9% NaCl solution and administered intragastrically, daily for 14 continuous days. the final high-, mid- and low-doses were 20, 10 and 5 g/kg weight/day. mice were sacrificed one, two, four and eight weeks after injury. goat anti-rat p75NTR polyclonal antibodies were diluted 100 times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin. cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription using total RNA templates. reduced glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase served as a housekeeping gene in each reaction system. slices were stained using combined Marsland, Glees and Erikson\u2019s silver stain (Marsland\u2019s) and Luxol fast blue (LFB) staining methods, as previously described (21,22). in total, 160 healthy adult male BALB/c mice (weighing 252 g) were housed and fed in Xi\u2019an Tianxingjian Natural Bio-products Group (Xi\u2019an, Shaanxi, China) the animal experiments were approved by Jilin University Ethics Committee. yrrhizin was dissolved in 0.9% NaCl solution and administered intragastrically. the final high-, mid- and low-doses were 20, 10 and 5 g/kg weight/day. mice were sacrificed one, two, four and eight weeks after injury. goat anti-rat p75NTR polyclonal antibodies were diluted 100 times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin. cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription using total RNA templates. p75NTR mRNA was detected by qPCR using cDNA templates. slices were stained using combined Marsland, Glees and Erikson\u2019s silver stain (Marsland\u2019s) and Luxol fast blue (LFB) staining methods. nerve fibers were stained black and myelin was stained blue (23). in each slice, five microscopic fields of 400 magnification were randomly selected. the amplitude and MNCV of the high- and mid-dose groups at one, two, four and eight weeks after injury were significantly higher than for the low-dose and control groups (P0.05). there was no statistically significant difference between the high- and mid-dose groups or between the low-dose and control groups. levels of p75NTR protein in each group increased markedly between one and two weeks after injury. at each time-point, each glycyrrhizin treatment group had significantly reduced p75NTR protein expression versus the control group. p75NTR/GAPDH blots (n=5) of each dose group at each time-point following injury. p75NTR, p75 neurotrophin receptor; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase. myelin sheaths in the low-dose group were irregularly shaped with marked fibrous hyperplasia. the number and diameter of myelinated fibers in the high- and mid-dose groups at each time-point were significantly higher than in the low- and control groups. the expression of GFAP and NSE in astrocytes was detected by indirect immunofluorescence staining at eight weeks after injury. GFAP staining appeared as blue dots and NSE stains appeared as an abundance of green in the cytoplasm. each glycyrrhizin treatment group had less blue fluorescence and more green fluorescence than the controls. the high-dose group had less blue fluorescence and more green fluorescence than the controls. the application of glycyrrhizin increased NSE and reduced GFAP expression in the astrocytes in order to improve sciatic nerve repair. levels of p75NTR protein in each group increased markedly between one and two weeks after injury. each glycyrrhizin treatment group had significantly reduced p75NTR protein expression versus the control group. p75NTR mRNA expression in the high- and mid-dose groups was significantly lower versus the control (P0.05) at each time-point. application of glycyrrhizin, particularly using doses of 20 and 10 mg/kg/day, markedly inhibited the expression of p75NTR at the protein and mRNA levels. 1.4320.013 0.5230.004 a P0.05 vs. low-dose and control groups. b P0.05 vs. control group (Student\u2019s t-test) Combined Marsland, Glees and Erikson\u2019s silver stain and Laxol fast blue staining (light microscopy, 400) nerve fibers are stained black and myelin is stained blue. GFAP staining appears as blue dots and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) staining appears as an abundance of green in the cytoplasm. glycyrrhizin treatment group had less blue fluorescence and more green fluorescence than the controls. glycyrrhizin increased NSE and reduced GFAP expression in the astrocytes in order to improve sciatic nerve repair. glycyrrhizin inhibited the expression of p75NTR at the protein and mRNA levels throughout the eight weeks of the experiment. this downregulation of p75NTR synchronizes the functional recovery of the sciatic nerve, structural myelination and neuronal regeneration. downregulation of p75NTR may attenuate apoptosis-inducing receptor function of p75NTR. sciatic nerve regeneration is associated with the downregulation of p75NTR."}
