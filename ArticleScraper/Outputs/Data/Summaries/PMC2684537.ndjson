{"summary": "Background Phaseolus vulgaris (common bean) is the second most important legume crop in the world after soybean. yield losses due to fungal infection, like Uromyces appendiculatus (bean rust), have strong consequences. downstream genes and mechanisms involved in bean resistance to infection are poorly characterized. the most devastating on bean is the uredinial stage. the latent period between the germination of an urediniospore and the formation of a sporulating pustule can be as short as 7 days. no large scale transcriptomic analysis of bean rust infection has been performed to better understand the mechanism of resistance. all of these Ur genes are effective against one specific rust strain, following the gene-for-gene resistance theory. however, such resistance may prove effective in the field for only a short time due to the adaptation of the fungus to overcome plant defenses. fected with virulent or avirulent bean rust Common bean is a diploid (n = 11) with a small genome size estimated at 450 to 650 Mb. this number was significantly less before the publication of [13] who added ESTs from root nodules, phosphorus deficient roots, developing pods, and shoots with and without C. lindemuthianum inoculation. 51% percent of the EST sequences were derived from bean tissue infected with race 41 since they had the \"race 41\" tag. this likely reflects compatibility between the race 41 and its host allowing greater fungal penetration. plant ESTs tagged with race 41 could be involved in this process. 62 singletons and 298 contigs included 62 singletons and 298 contigs. Unisequence singleton contig = 2 contig>2 vector 13 2 7 4 No hit 118 49 66 3 Low hit (>e-20) the most abundant category contained the unknown (31.9%), non-classified (4.7%), and low or no hit (3.7%) groups. the remaining 49.7% of the sequences were grouped into 14 categories. the primary metabolism category comprises the largest component (5.9%) of the library based on the number of unisequences and the proportion of contigs composed of a high number of sequences. three of the other 15 largest contigs are also found in the primary metabolism category. 121 CL1Contig159 Amino acid and protein metabolism common bean Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase 98 CL1Contig301 primary metabolism common bean Plastidic aldolase 92 CL2Contig2 energy common bean oxidation. 202 sequences, out of 10,221 bean ESTs, can be considered as new P. vulgaris unigenes. 791 sequences present a perfect match, 762 sequences have 1 mismatch or indel, 658 have 2 mismatches and/or indels. average of 1 SNP/indel is putatively identified every 335 bp. the 360 fungal sequences represent 3.4% of the library. two studies in rice showed that the harvesting time and the stringency of selection are very important to accurately sample the abundance of fungal EST in infected leaf tissue. list of the 15 most common fungal rust contigs containing the highest number of sequences. the high similarity of these 19 sequences makes them likely candidates to encode potential effectors or avirulence proteins. ciae haustorium-specific cDNA similar to 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase 8 CL116Contig2 Uromyces appendiculatus cDNA from hyphae from gernimating uredospore similar to unknown 8 CL772Contig1 Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici SSH-library of Puccinia graminis infected wheat leaves similar to 60s ribosomal the physical map was made from common bean cultivar G19833. the number of putative SNP between the BAC-end sequences and the ESTs was identified among the 1,704 matching ESTs. this represents an average of 1 SNP/indel every 570 bp. three bean genes, TC197, TC127, and TC185, were selected based on their housekeeping function and/or their presence in different bean cDNA libraries. homologs of cons6, cons7, and cons15 (encoding for a F-box protein family, a metalloprotease, and a peptidase S16 respectively) were chosen because they were recently shown to be expressed constitutively in soybean [26] genes with the most stable expression during the conditions tested are on the right of the diagram. expression level of six, selected fungal genes was analyzed using qRT-PCR. expression level of six genes was significantly higher in tissues infected with the virulent race 41 isolate. qRT-PCR was performed on three independent biological replicates. six ESTs, CL2800Contig1 (heat shock protein 90), CL1917Contig1 (proteasome subunit alpha), CL2317Contig1 (proteasome subunit alpha), CL3018Contig1 (planta-induced rust protein 1), and CL4935Contig1 (unknown) were found strongly up-regulated in tissues infected with the fungal race 41. the first two comparisons highlight regulation in the infected plants by the rust fungi. the third comparison highlights gene expression differences between the two types of infection. the transcriptional response was profiled in relation to the time after inoculation. in bean infected by race 41, no plant defense is activated and gene expression may reflect the reprogramming of the plant host by the fungus especially at the haustorial site. columns light and dark gray represent the number of transcripts differentially regulated in the bean infected by race 49. soybean plants infected with Phytophthora sojae, a hemibiotrophic oomycete, did not show a biphasic pattern of gene response. a more detailed analysis was performed on the expression ratio of transcripts in bean leaves inoculated with the fungus race 41 or race 49 versus uninoculated bean leaves. rust race 41 likely secretes effector proteins that suppress the plant defense pathway induced by PAMPs. first induction of genes such as WIN2 by race 41 and subsequent reduction in expression may be associated with this suppression of defense by the virulent pathogen only. second group, group B, is composed of 16 genes that were induced at the beginning of the infection but were slightly down-regulated at the later time points independent of the fungal race. qRT-PCR was performed on 3 independent biological replicates. these 90 representative genes mainly identified genes involved in the early responses of the bean under rust infection. these genes share different expression patterns but are likely involved in the basal defense response, which is induced by PAMPs. 83,448 ESTs were added from root nodules, phosphorus deficient roots, developing pods, and shoots with and without C. lindemuthianum inoculation. lack of sufficient P. vulgaris sequences precludes the construction of a useful DNA microarray for this plant. plant ESTs tagged with race 41 could be involved in this process. X-axis represents the fungal race with which the leaves were infected. two thousand seven hundred twenty one sequences showed no similarity with other sequences. nce singleton contig = 2 contig>2 vector 13 2 7 4 No hit 118 49 66 3 Low hit (>e-20) 1279 514 663 102 Fungi 360 62 210 88 Barley 1 1 0 0 Ice plant 1 0 1 0 Petunia 1 1 0 0 S. pombe 1 0 Sugarcane 1 1 0 Sunflower 1 0 1 0 Beet 2 1 0 1 N. benthamiana 2 the most abundant category contained the unknown (31.9%), non-classified (4.7%), low or no hit (3.7%) groups and represents 50.3% of the entire library. the remaining 49.7% of the sequences were grouped into 14 categories. ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase activase (RuBisco activase) is composed of 496 aligned sequences. three of the other 15 largest contigs are also found in the primary metabolism category. list of the 15 most abundant bean contigs with the highest number of sequences. 106 CL1Contig89 oxidation common bean glycolate oxidase 98 CL1Contig301 primary metabolism common bean Plastidic aldolase 92 CL2Contig2 energy common bean Oxygen-evolving enhancer protein 1, chloroplast precursor 88 CL3Contig1 Amino acid and protein metabolism common bean T6D22.2 80 CL1Contig218 oxidation Soybean F1E22.18. ESTs present in the NCBI database originate from common bean cultivars. 791 sequences present a perfect match, 762 sequences have 1 mismatch or indel, 658 have 2 mismatches and/or indels. an average of 1 SNP/indel is putatively identified every 335 bp. the selected E-value was e-20, greatly reducing the risk of false positive clones. at 5DAI, the haustoria are already mature and are probably redirecting the nutrient up-taken from the plant based on their genes expression pattern. contigs contain the highest number of sequences Total ESTs in contig Contig annotation genus gene annotation * 18 CL1Contig467 Phakopsora pachyrhizi cDNA from germinating urediniospores SSH-library similar to beta-galactosidase 14 CL229Contig1 Uromyces appendiculatus cDNA from hyphae from gernimating uredospore similar to unknown 10 CL spore similar to ribosomal protein L5 gene 8 CL772Contig1 Uromyces viciae haustorium-specific cDNA similar to voltage-dependent ion-selective channel 8 CL582Contig1 Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici SSH-library of Puccinia graminis infected wheat leaves similar to glutathione S-transferase. 1,704 unisequences, more than 15% of the total library, could be linked to the physical map. the physical map was made from common bean cultivar G19833. the number of putative SNP between the BAC-end sequences and the ESTs was identified among the 1,704 matching ESTs. homologs of soybean genes cons6, cons7, and cons15 (encoding for a F-box protein family, a metalloprotease, and a peptidase S16 respectively) were selected based on their housekeeping function and/or their presence in different bean cDNA libraries. preliminary analysis of these putative constitutive genes by qRT-PCR performed on leaf, stem, and pod cDNA led to the elimination of TC197, cons15 and TC185 due analysis of selected ESTs during bean rust infection process. expression level of six genes was analyzed using qRT-PCR. expression level of six genes was significantly higher in tissues infected with race 41 isolate. contig1 (proteasome subunit alpha), CL2317Contig1 (glutamine synthetase), CL3018Contig1 (asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase), and CL4935Contig1 (unknown) found strongly up-regulated in tissues infected with race 41. tag identification for these ESTs is \"late race 41\" indicating that they came originally from tissue infected with race 41. p-value 0.05, cut-off -1 or > 1 or p-value 0.1, cut-off -0.58 or > 0.58 in log base 2). transcriptional response was profiled in relation to the time after inoculation. 39 and 41 genes showed differential regulation within 6 and 12 HAI. at the latest time points, 72 and 96 HAI, 16 and 19 genes, respectively, for race 41 and 6 and 14 genes, respectively, were differentially regulated. columns light and dark gray represent the number of transcripts differentially regulated in bean infected by race 41 or 49, respectively, in comparison to uninoculated bean plants. van de Mortel et al. (2007) study on Glycine max \u2013 Phakopsora pachyrhizi found most genes were regulated early during infection (the first 24 hours) but at the intermediate time points (24 to 72 hours), few genes were regulated. this biphasic pattern might be specific to the biotrophic rust fungi. further comparisons need to be made to establish the specificity of this \"dip\" pattern of gene expression in response to biotrophic fungal infection. rust race 41 likely secretes effector proteins that suppress the plant defense pathways induced by a fungal-PAMP. the first induction of genes such as WIN2 by race 41 may be associated with this suppression of defense by the virulent pathogen only. the second group, group B, is composed of 16 genes that were induced at the beginning of the infection but were slightly down-regulated at the later time points independent of the fungal race. this group is rich in genes categorized as plant defense representing 56% of this group. 90 genes mainly identified genes involved in early responses of the bean under rust infection (i.e., first 96 HAI) these genes share different expression patterns but are likely involved in the basal defense response, which is induced by PAMPs. this may be due to the inability of this avirulent pathogen to suppress the plant defense system. early gallatin plants were inoculated with either U. appendiculatus race 41 or race 49 (avirulent strain) uredospores. the primary leaves of 10 day old plants were inoculated on the top and bottom. 20,736 cDNAs were cloned in pGem-T (Promega) for sequencing. the library was sub-divided in 4 parts based on sequence tags added during library construction. the EST sequences were first cleaned of polyA, polyT, and low complexity sequence. cDNA synthesis was prepared from 5 g of RNA using the MMLV reverse transcriptase. qRT-PCR primers were designed with primer3 software http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/primer3/input.htm. a high mean pairwise variation is found for gene with low expression stability. early gallatin plants were inoculated with either U. appendiculatus race 41 or race 49 (avirulent strain) uredospores. the primary leaves of 10 day old plants were inoculated on the top and bottom. 20,736 cDNA clones were cloned in pGem-T (Promega) for sequencing. the library was sub-divided in 4 parts based on sequence tags added during library construction. cDNA synthesis was prepared from 5 g of RNA using the MMLV reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI) qRT-PCR primers were designed with primer3 software http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/primer3/input.htm. geNorm software calculates mean pairwise variation (based on geometrical mean) for each gene. a high mean pairwise variation is found for gene with low expression stability. authors read and approved the final manuscript."}
