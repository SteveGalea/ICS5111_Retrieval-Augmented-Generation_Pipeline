{"summary": "since 1950, 12 provinces reported plague including seven with reports of bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic plague in humans. pneumonia treatment in china is often determined without the support of sputum culture or smear making detection of plague unlikely during diagnostic workup. in the past 100 years, human plague has not been identified in either Yulong County or Lijiang Prefecture. a qualified plague diagnostic laboratory in the prefecture capital, Lijiang, has the capacity to assist with plague diagnosis. the Nanxi administrative village is in Huangshan township, Yulong County. the population of 208,000 is dispersed throughout 97 administrative villages. the population of 208,000 is dispersed throughout 97 administrative villages. the population of 208,000 is dispersed throughout 97 administrative villages. the Nanxi administrative village is in Huangshan township, Yulong County. it has one central area and seven satellite hamlets. the village lies in a mountain range between 2,900 and 3,300 m of altitude. our house-to-house search of Nanxi Village found no additional cases of severe pneumonia or a person who had recently died of or survived a severe respiratory disease or a severe infection. there were 315 (129/100,000 population per year) total pneumonia cases from departments of three hospitals in Yulong County from September 2004 to November 2005. the first case of pneumonia in the cluster, patient A, was a 26-year-old male farmer. he developed fever, cough, fatigue, dyspnea, and expectorated yellow, blood-tinged sputum. the next morning, he was admitted to a county hospital. by November 2 respiratory distress had worsened and was transferred to the intensive care unit. symptoms Chest radiograph Leukocyte count (109/L) Antibiotics Outcome A M 26 10/25 Unknown Dizziness, fever, and fatigue Bilateral multisegmental consolidation 8.55 No record Died on 01/11 C F 22 10/30 Exposure to patient A Fever, fatigue, sore feet Bilateral multisegmental consolidation 7.0\u20139.12 Levofloxacin Rocephin Died on 02/11 D M 37 10/30 Exposure to patient A Fever, surviving three patients showed inconclusive results on different patients for each pathogen. none of the patients had sputum smears, sputum cultures, or blood cultures done during their acute illness. all four healthy occupants of the truck cab, including the mother of patient A, developed PPP from 1.5 to 3 days after they shared the truck ride with patient A. no other PPP cases among 234 other family and village contacts and 153 health care workers. in early October, a previously healthy domestic dog in his home died. in august 2005, a previously healthy domestic cat died. the three other affected families reported no unexpected deaths or illnesses in their domestic animals including dogs or cats. none of the identified pneumonia cases met our definition of severe pneumonia. the cluster under investigation reported 69 deaths in 2005. none of these deaths were attributed to pneumonia. the remaining patient did not receive antibiotics and died on the fourth day of illness. the remaining patient died on the fourth day of illness. IHA tests for 16 other respiratory agents were all negative. none of the patients had sputum smears, sputum cultures, or blood cultures done during their acute illness. four healthy occupants of the truck cab developed PPP from 1.5 to 3 days after they shared the truck ride with patient A. no other PPP cases among 234 other family and village contacts and 153 health care workers. villagers with no recent contact 186 0 0 * PPP = primary pneumonic plague. villagers reported no deviation from this routine, no contact with wild animals, no hunting, no sighting of dead or dying rodents. a sputum smear showing sheets of gram-negative coccobacilli or bipolar staining should immediately raise suspicion of PPP. a sputum smear showing sheets of gram-negative coccobacilli or bipolar staining should immediately raise suspicion of PPP. despite more person-hours of contact, family members of secondary cases were not infected nor were medical staff who attended all the patients without special protective measures. despite many more person-hours of contact, family members of secondary cases were not infected nor were medical staff who attended all the patients without special protective measures. dogs can develop pneumonic plague and infect humans7,15,16. the dog died too far outside of the maximum incubation period of PPP. there is a strict regulation for reporting of a severe pneumonia case because of the SARS epidemic in china."}
