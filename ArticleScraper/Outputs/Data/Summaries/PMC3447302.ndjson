{"summary": "pigs infected with swine influenza virus could produce cross-reactive antibodies against pandemic. pigs infected with swine influenza virus could produce cross-reactive antibodies against pandemic. the pig production in Norway consists of approximately 2500 herds, mostly small family farms, with about 1.5 million slaughtered pigs in 2010. the pig population is free for aujeszky's disease (AD), transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE), porcine respiratory corona virus (PRCV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), and mycoplasma hyopneumoniae. in herds suspected to have an active infection, nasal swabs were collected from 20 pigs at different ages. in herds without clinical signs, blood samples were collected from at least 20 pigs (sows or slaughtered pigs) for serological testing. the risk of having 20 nonreactors from a positive farm is less than 4%. blood samples from 20 slaughtered pigs were tested for antibodies against pandemic (H1N1) 2009. blood samples were taken on condition that 6 to 12 months had elapsed since the herd first tested positive. an additional testing was performed in 9 herds about 18 months after the pandemic. serum samples were analyzed using hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) assays. a herd was considered seropositive if three or more blood samples were positive for influenza-A-specific NP antibodies. a herd was retested with samples from another 20 pigs. amplification was performed on a Stratagene Mx3500P (LaJolla, CA, USA) with superscript III Platinum One-Step Quantitative RT-PCR system (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) one RT-PCR-positive sample was sufficient to confirm a herd as positive for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus. study material Following the primary outbreak in October 2009, an intensified surveillance was immediately initiated to investigate the extent of SIV infection in the pig population in Norway. in herds suspected to have an active infection, nasal swabs were collected from at least 20 pigs at different ages, with priority of sampling pigs with clinical symptoms. the biosecurity level is high in both types of herds. blood samples were collected from 20 slaughtered pigs from 112 nucleus and multiplier herds. a third study was initiated to follow the course of the pandemic. safety authority was available from 43 pig herds suspected to be infected. the size of these herds ranged in numbers from 5 to 2000 pigs (average 550 pigs) the size of these herds ranged in numbers from 5 to 2000 pigs (average 550 pigs) the antigens for the HI tests were produced in chicken eggs at the Norwegian Veterinary Institute in Oslo. Titers 40 were considered positive. RNA was extracted from 200 L of the sample material. 1 L extracted RNA was amplified using 46 primer pairs and a one-step RT-PCR kit (QIAGEN, Oslo, Norway) the resulting overlapping amplicons, carrying primer-derived M13 terminal sequences, were sequenced using the ABI BigDye Terminator v1.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit and the ABI 3130 Genetic Analyzer. a total of 2349 blood samples from 112 nucleus and multiplier herds were tested for antibodies against influenza A virus. in study 2, a total of 2349 blood samples from 112 nucleus and multiplier herds were tested for antibodies against pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus. in total, 16 herds were found seropositive for pandemic (H1N1) 2009. the proportion of seropositive herds in different counties varied from 21% in the low pig density counties of Vestlandet to 57% in the high pig density county of Rogaland and Agder. the surveillance program in 2010 shows that 42% (19 positive/45 tested herds) of nucleus and 44% (30 positive/68 tested herds) of multiplier herds were sero dmark and Oppland 72 1 (1%) 65 18 (28%) Total Norway 452 16 (3.5%) (95% CI 2.2\u20135.7%) 459 190 (41%) (95% CI 37\u201346%) pig herds confirmed positive by laboratory testing (serology or PCR) discussions pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus was first detected in pigs on the 10th of October 2009. despite rapid implementation of control measures, the virus had in a short period of time been spread to pig herds throughout Norway. by the end of 2009, 91 herds had tested positive for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus and/or antibodies against the virus. the national surveillance program for SIV in Norway shows that the first herd positive for antibodies against pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus was sampled on the 30th of September 2009. of all the herds that were tested in 2010, 41% were seropositive. this suggests virus transmission between pig herds, either by movement of pigs and people visiting infected herds. there are no cross-reactive antibodies to pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus or any of the other SIV subtypes. this has probably contributed to the high prevalence of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus in the Norwegian pig population. pig herds positive for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus were tested again in 2010. results show that there was no seroconversion in pigs born at least two months after the virus was first detected. pigs born in 2010/2011 are seropositive, indicating an ongoing spread of the infection. biosecurity nucleus herds seem to have been important for the introduction and spread of the infection. no clinical signs were observed in many infected herds."}
