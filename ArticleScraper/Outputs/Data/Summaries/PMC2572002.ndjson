{"summary": "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) caused a worldwide epidemic of SARS with a fatality rate of 9.6% in 2002/03 and later reemerged. the global outbreak that occurred in 2002/03 and the cluster of 2003/04 SARS cases were the result of two independent zoonotic transfers from palm civets to humans. evidence suggested the existence of another precursor reservoir. we previously developed a potent human nAb 80R against S protein of both civet and human 2002/03 viral strains. 80R recognizes a conformationally sensitive epitope located within the receptor binding domain (RBD). nAb escape studies with 80R recapitulated a highly conserved escape mutation that also occurred naturally from 2002/03 to 2003/04 viruses. serologic analysis Eleven randomly selected serum samples from patients who developed SARS during the 2002/03 outbreak were analyzed for their neutralizing activities against S protein pseudotyped viruses. the 2002/03 patient serum samples are statistically significantly more potent in neutralizing Tor2 than GD03. 2002/03 patient sera competed for 80R's binding significantly stronger than 2003/04 serum samples. a larger percentage of Tor2-RBD directed Abs in 2002/03 serum samples are \u201c80R-like\u201d nAbs than in 2003/04 serum samples. a, \u201c*\u201d indicates the data points for a negative civet cat serum sample. the samples labeled as patient 1\u20134 that were the same patients described before [5]. the data was presented the same way as panel A and unpaired Student t-test. ified SARS-CoV (Urbani used here, same as Tor2) with 80R, a total of 4 isolated plaques were picked. all viruses were confirmed to be 80R-resistant at a concentration 100-fold greater than that needed for neutralizing 90% of wild-type viruses. sequences of the complete S gene of these four 80R-escape variants revealed one common mutation at amino acid position 480.

Abs were captured on a CM4 chip via immobilized anti-human IgG1. GD03-RBD at various concentrations (2 folds serial dilutions, highest concentration was indicated) was injected over the chip surface. binding response curves (red lines) are overlaid with the fit of the interaction model. only panning against D480A-magnetic beads resulted in D480A-RBD specific ELISA positive clones and only one clone, scFv 256 bound to cell-surface expressed D480A full-length S protein. 256-scFv was converted to whole human IgG1 and then tested separately for neutralization of D480A and D480G (D480A>D480G) but with 80% activity at the highest Ab concentration tested ( the 256 epitope is also distinct from 80R and 11A. neither 80R nor 11A competed with 256 for ACE2 or GD03-RBD binding. the 256 epitope is also distinct from 80R and 11A. the assay was the same as Fig. 2C except 256 was used here. 256 scFv expressing phages were mixed with various scFv-Fc antibody or full-length IgG1s at indicated antibody concentration. 256-phages homologous to 256-IgG1 were used as positive controls. focused mutagenesis Structural data guided a different approach to engineer 80R to have more broadly neutralizing activity against D480A/G and 2003/04 outbreak strains. all of the contacting residues are located in the V light chain. in 80R CDRL1, D480 makes an intermolecular salt bridge to R162 that is flanked by two neutral residues. all 5 Abs have one consensus change from S to N at position 163. only clones that bound to four variant S protein RBDs (Tor2, Tor2-D480A/G, GD03) were further characterized. 196 cs-5, cs-25, cs-34, cs-84, cs-110 fm 161\u2013163 1.5104 D480A-RBD 77/96 fm4,fm5, fm6,fm12 D480G-RBD 48/96 fm39 162\u2013164 3104 GD03-RBD 47/96 fm4,fm5, fm6,fm12,fm39. EL cs5, cs84, fm6 and fm39 were tested for neutralization of pseudotyped viruses. cs- and fm-library strategies resulted in isolation of BnAbs with activity against four RBD variants. two state conformational change model are presented. this suggests that a conformational change may occur after the formation of the initial binding complex. a conformational change may occur after the formation of the initial binding complex. the affinity of the cs5 and cs84 Abs for Tor2-RBD wasone-fold lower than 80R. both nAbs gained cross-reactivity for GD03, D480A and D480G. the fm6 and fm39 Abs have circa 10-fold lower affinity for GD03. all 11 serum samples from 2002/03 outbreak were able to neutralize Tor2 and GD03 pseudotyped viruses, but the potency was quite different. the 2002/03 patient serum samples are statistically significantly more potent in neutralizing Tor2 than GD03 compared to GD03. 11 of convalescent serum samples were obtained from SARS patients of the 2002/03 outbreak in china. data were shown in a box and whiskers graph. the box extends from 25th percentile to 75th percentile. samples were the same as those used in panel A, C, and D. the data was presented the same way as panel A and unpaired Student t-test. mutation of 480 did not affect binding of RBD of S protein to human ACE2 receptor [25] or viral replication in Vero cells. the mutation arose from the selection pressure of 80R that coincides with the change from 2002/03 viruses to G480 in 2003/04 viruses (PC04/GD03) nAb 11A GD03-RBD was initially used as bait to isolate cross-strain nAbs that could recognize promiscuous amino acids at positions 472 and 480. one of them 11A was found to be a potent nAb against GD03 but not against Tor2. at either position resulted in complete loss of 11A binding. other amino acid changes at positions of V404A, Y442F, K465A, T468A and S487A did not affect 11A binding. on the basis of this result, all of the 2004 civet viruses should also be recognized and neutralized by 11A. GD03-RBD-C9 or control-RBD-C9 (Filled purple) used for staining is at 20 ug/mL. the Abs (256 or 80R negative control) were used at 50 ug/mL to compete for the binding of GD03-RBD to 293T-ACE2 cells. scFv was converted to whole human IgG1 and then tested separately for neutralization of Tor2-, GD03-, D480A-, and D480G-pseudotyped viruses. 256-IgG1 neutralized D480A and D480G (D480A>D480G) but with 80% activity at the highest Ab concentration tested (50 g/mL) it also inhibited Tor2 viral entry but was much less potent than 80R anti-CXCR4 Ab 33-IgG1[42] was used as a negative control. 80R and 11A were used as positive control for Tor2- and GD03-viruses. competition for binding of GD03-RBD-C9 to 293T-ACE2 cells. 256-phages homologous to 256-IgG1 were used as positive controls. both showed competition for 256-phage binding to either Tor2-RBD and GD03-RBD, 80R or 11A did not show inhibition of 256-phages binding to either Tor2- or GD03-RBDs. epitope mapping showed that two amino acids in the GD03-RBD region (472P and 480G) were critically important for 11A's binding. single amino acid changes at either position resulted in complete loss of 11A binding. other amino acids at positions of V404A, Y442F, K465A, T468A and S487A did not affect 11A binding. binding response curves (red lines) are overlaid with the fit of the interaction model (black lines) all ka, kd, KD value showed in the table represent the means and standard errors of three experiments. GD03-RBD-C9 or control-RBD-C9 used for staining is at 20 ug/mL. scFv 256 bound to cell-surface expressed D480A full-length S protein. 256-IgG1 neutralized D480A and D480G (D480A>D480G) but with 80% activity at the highest Ab concentration tested (50 g/mL) it also inhibited Tor2 viral entry but was much less potent than 80R and only marginally neutralized GD03. 256-IgG1 showed even lower neutralization titer in the 256 epitope is also distinct from 80R and 11A. neither 80R nor 11A competed with 256 for GD03-RBD binding. the assay was the same as Fig. 2C except 256 was used here. 256-phages homologous to 256-IgG1 were used as positive controls. 256-phages homologous to 256-IgG1 were used as positive controls. 80R or 11A did not show inhibition of 256-phages binding to either GD03-RBDs. amino acids 162\u2013164 form part of a WRCY \u201chot spot\u201d motif for AID-mediated somatic hypermutation (SHM) [27],[28] and R162 and N164 are mutated from germline serine. this suggests firstly that mutations within this region would likely exist in our circa 108 member non-immune Vkappa (V) repertoire. a common feature of 5 unique Abs recovered is the amino acid changes in CDRL1 region from position aa161\u2013164 that are important contact residues for D480 in RBD. these 5 Abs maintained germline D182 in CDRL1 of IGKV3-NL5*01 and germline R223 in CDRL3 of IGKJ1*01 respectively. two rounds of selection for 80R- V-cs library and one round selection for 80R-fm library were performed before ELISA screening for positive clones. the amino acid sequences in CDRL1 (161\u2013164) of these 5 clones were shown in Fig. 5A. four of these fm Abs had the SN change at position 163 and one from D480G and GD03 panning. cFvs were converted to human mAbs and tested for neutralization of pseudotyped viruses. RN change at position 162 was associated with increased potency of cs5 and cs84. RE charge reversal at 162 was found with the most potent fm-Abs: fm6 and fm39. kinetics of ab interactions with Tor2-RBD or GD03-RBD was determined by steady state affinity model. biosensor-grams are presented for qualitative comparisons. 1.42.0 42.40.1 38.30.6 fm39/D480A 0.20.0 fm6/D480A 0.20.0 cs5/D480A 0.50.1 fm5/D480A 1.10.3 cs84/D480A 1.40.2 The kinetic data were analysed by using either the 11 interaction model or the two state conformational change model. in vitro nAb escape studies have provided strong support for the existence of a natural nAb driven evolution pathway. nAb responses were measured in convalescent serum from chronically exposed civet farmers, 2002/03 and 2003/04 civet cats. the five nAbs in group III are most like 80R in their ability to only neutralize human isolates from the 2002/03 outbreak [30], although it is unknown if they have the same D480 dependence as 80R. nAbs with different activities are produced in serum of naturally infected hosts. phylogeny analysis of S genes from 2003 civets (SZ3) and 2004 civets (PC04) indicates a positive selection during animal-to-animal transmission. in civets, 80R or 80R-like nAbs-mediated immune pressure could be a major driving force for positive selection of G480 in PC04 during evolution from SZ3 or a common ancestral strain (s) only one Ab 256 that had extraordinary binding affinity for Tor2, D480A and GD03 was isolated. nAb 256 did not compete for RBDs binding to ACE2. the strategy of de novo selection with non-immune libraries against different viral spike proteins is neither efficient nor sufficient. all Abs had amino acid changes in the CDRL1 region from position aa161\u2013164, with a consensus change of SN at position 163. the consensus S163N change was again found and parental 80R Y164N mutational change was maintained. nAb 80R, originally targeted to SARS-CoV Tor2, was successfully broadened to become active against other viral strains including GD03 and 80R's escape mutants. nAbs such as 80R-fm6 and/or other 80R-cs/fm variants could be used either alone or in combination to manipulate virus evolution and compromise fitness through Ab blockade of escape pathways. in vitro derived escape variants can promote AID-mediated sequence diversification of germinal center B-cells. serum samples were verified positive for SARS-like-CoV Ab. all sera were heat-inactivated at 56\u00b0C for 30 mins prior to performing the experiments. luciferase activity in target cells was measured with an EG&G Berthold microplate Luminometer LB 96V. mutants were generated by incubating an equal volume (0.5 ml) of wild-type SARS-CoV (Urbani strain, 3106 pfu/ml) and 1.5 ug/ml of 80R Ab for 1 h at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. the PCR products were cloned by TOPO-cloning vector (Invitrogen) 5 clones of each PCR product were analyzed for nucleotide sequences of the SARS-CoV spike. all mutants of RBD were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis. mutant pFarber-80R-scFv DNA was electroporated into TG1 cells to generate 80R-fm-library. phage antibodies from each library were produced as described [40] and used for panning (selection) single phage-scFv clones were selected for further sequence analysis. clones that bound to targets with A 450>1.0 were selected for further sequence analysis. phage-scFvs and whole human IgG1s were produced. anti-human IgG Fc antibody (Biacore) was covalently coated to CM4 sensor chip by amine-coupling using the coupling kit (Biacore). Abs were captured onto anti-human IgG Fc surfaces at the flow rate of 10 l/min in HBS buffer (Biacore) four serum samples from 2003/04 sporadic cases were collected 11 days after onset of symptoms. the diagnostic criteria for SARS-CoV infection followed the clinical description released by WHO. plasmid pCMVR8.2 encoding HIV-1 Gag-Pol and pHIV-Luc encoding the firefly luciferase reporter gene under control of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat. testing antibodies or sera were incubated with adequate amount of S-protein-pseudotyped viruses for 30 mins at room temperature. PCR products were cloned by TOPO-cloning vector (Invitrogen) 5 clones of each PCR product were analyzed for nucleotide sequences of the SARS-CoV spike. mutants of RBD were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis. pFarber-80R-scFv DNA was electroporated into TG1 cells to generate 80R-fm-library. three transformations were performed to generate 80R-VL-cs-library. targeting residues were mutated to all 20 amino acids by using degenerated oligonucleotides. immunotube-bound or beads-coupled proteins were incubated with phage-scFvs from different libraries. specific bound phages were eluted with 100 mM triethylamine, neutralized by 1 M Tris pH 7.4. clones that bound to targets with A 450>1.0 were selected for further sequence analysis. anti-human IgG Fc antibody (Biacore) was covalently coated to CM4 sensor chip by amine-coupling using the coupling kit. a buffer injection served as a negative control. ka, kd, KD reported here represent the means and standard errors of at least two experiments. statistical analysis of differences between serum samples in binding to Tor2-RBD and competition ability of 80R's binding to Tor2-RBD."}
