{"summary": "7733 patients and controls in the military had clinical data and nasal wash samples collected prospectively and sent for PCR testing. patients with one pathogen detected were compared with those with two pathogens (dual pathogen). the respiratory mucosa has abundant resident flora to begin with. it may also be due to multiple pathogens co-existing in a microenvironment of complex interactions,5 which is not unexpected as the respiratory mucosa has abundant resident flora. a standardised questionnaire was administered and nasal wash sampling performed by trained personnel followed by routine clinical assessment by an attending physician. repeated consultations were excluded if the patient was deemed to not have recovered from the first episode of illness. randomly selected unmatched controls were also obtained across the year for comparative purposes of baseline commensal rates. subtypes, and \u2018enterovirus\u2019 also includes coxsackievirus, echovirus and rhinovirus. interval/ratio variables were compared using one-way analysis of variance. comparison of nominal variables with expected frequencies less than 5 was done using Fisher's exact test. study site and population All Singaporean males enter national service for 2 years after high school or equivalent. majority spend most of their time in communal living and training quarters in military camps and return home on weekends, resulting in a semi-closed environment with community interaction. Detailed laboratory methods have been described in previous publication. a total of 11 mono-pathogens and 18 dual-pathogen pairs were available for comparison. a total of 11 mono-pathogens and 18 dual-pathogen pairs were available for comparison. dual pathogens were compared against mono-pathogens for mean proportions of 16 symptoms (or signs) symptom expression was calculated using Pearson's chi-square test at a significance level of 0.05. p-values compared across all columns, with any statistical significance reflected Characteristic Controls Patients p-values compared across all columns. Mono-pathogens Dual pathogens >2 pathogens Median age (Range) 20.6 (17.6, 55.0) 20.4 (17.3, 59.4) 20.3 (13.2, 60.0) 20.2 (17.7, 50.7) 20.3 (17.4, 37.1) 0.001 Male (%) 1342 (99.9) 2382 (99.6) 3532 (99.8) 1563 (99.9) 236 (99.2). Table2 shows the differences in detection of pathogens between patients and controls. there were no significant differences in RSV, M. pneumonia, S. pneumonia and N. meningitidis between the two groups. a curve is drawn between two pathogens if there is a patient with both pathogens detected. curves in black represent dual pathogens with counts of more than or equal to 15, while curves in grey represent dual pathogens with counts of less than 15 patients. the most common trio was adenovirus with S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae. body temperature Mean body temperature of viral mono-pathogen patients was slightly higher than that of bacterial mono-pathogen patients. dual pathogens with either influenza A (38.5\u00b0C, 95%CI 38.2, 38.7) or influenza B (38.7\u00b0C, 95%CI 38.3, 39.0) were associated with high proportions of chills and rigors. the proportion among dual-pathogen patients was also lower than the patients infected with the virus alone or the bacteria alone (P = 0.005, P = 0.03, respectively). nasal symptoms Mean proportion of viral mono-pathogen patients having nasal symptoms was higher than that of bacterial mono-pathogen patients (0.790 vs 0.670, P 0.001). joint pains Mean proportion of viral mono-pathogen patients with joint pains was slightly lower than that of bacterial mono-pathogen patients. however, no dual-pathogen pairs had statistically different levels than their respective viral mono-pathogens. 107 4.79 14 0.63 3 0.13 11 0.49 Dual pathogen (n = 1564) 122 7.80 13 0.83 9 0.58 4 0.26 Viral\u2013Viral (n = 138) 9 6.52 0 0 0 0 0 Viral\u2013Viral (n = 138) 93 7.82 9 0.76 5 0.42 4 0.34 Bacterial\u2013Bacterial (n = 237) 20 8.44 4 1.69 4 1.69 0 0 More than 2 mono-, dual- and more than 2 pathogens per pathogen. Influenza A (80.0%), influenza B (73.0%) and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae) tended to occur alone.

PCR is not the optimal method for diagnosis of bacterial infections. irv0009-0200-sd1.pptx (3.3MB, pptx) Table S1.
