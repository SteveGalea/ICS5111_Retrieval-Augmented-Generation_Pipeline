{"summary": "adaptive processes mediate cross-species jumps for double-host viruses such as arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) this information is critical for understanding and predicting long-term consequences of pathogen emergence and maintenance in affected areas. a new lineage of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) emerged in 2004 in Kenya. CHIKV is maintained in enzootic cycles involving transmission between non-human primates and canopy-dwelling, primatophilic Aedes mosquitoes. in africa, CHIKV is maintained in enzootic cycles involving transmission between non-human primates and canopy-dwelling, primatophilic Aedes mosquitoes. in india, both urban CHIKV vectors are present. the involvement of A. albopictus as the principal vector was documented at least in the states of Kerala and Coastal Karnataka [24]\u2013[27]. CHIKV transmission by A. albopictus was shown to be associated with the acquisition of the A226V amino acid substitution in the E1 envelope glycoprotein [24], [28]\u2013[32] (Figure S1) that is responsible for alphavirus virion assembly and virus fusion in endosomes of target cells. position E2-210 is located in the domain B of the E2 glycoprotein [39] and several earlier studies demonstrated that mutations in this domain mediate host specificity of several alphaviruses [5], [7], [40]\u2013[42] as well as the selection of escape mutants by neutralizing antibodies [43]\u2013[45]. Moreover, epistatic interactions between mutations at positions E1-226 and E2-211 of CHIKV influence the penetrance of the E1-226V substitution for fitness the SL-CK1 strain of CHIKV (hereafter abbreviated SL07) was isolated in 2007 in Sri Lanka. the SL-07 isolate was passed only twice on vero cells since its isolation from a febrile patient. this limiting the potential for cell culture-adaptive mutations that can artificially influence alphavirus fitness in vertebrate and/or mosquito hosts. the specific infectivity and viral titers in cell culture supernatants were almost identical for all constructs. the introduced mutations did not attenuate CHIKV in vero cells. adaptation of arboviruses is typically expected to result in an increased ability to develop a disseminated infection leading to salivary gland infection. SL07-226V-210Q-Apa was produced by reverting the ApaI site in SL07-226V-Apa to the wild-type (w.t.) nucleotide sequence. the dissemination of SL07-226V-210Q-Apa was 3.4 times higher than that of SL07-226V (p = 0.017) the difference in number of mosquitoes with E2-210L versus E2-210Q residues was tested with a one-tailed McNemar test. the difference in number of mosquitoes with E2-210L versus E2-210Q residues was tested for significance with a one-tailed McNemar test. SL07-226V-210Q was serially passaged in the presence of a 100-fold excess of SL07-226V-Apa (surrogate \u201cwild-type\u201d virus) in an alternating cycle between A. albopictus mosquitoes and Vero cells. despite being present in 100-fold lower quantity in the initial virus population, the SL07-226V-210Q virus alone was detected in 31.6% of mosquitoes after 3 alternating mosquito-Ver the SL07-226V-210Q virus was mixed with 100-fold excess of SL07-226V-Apa virus and presented orally to A. albopictus (Galveston) at 10 dpi CHIKV was extracted from combined head and leg homogenates derived from 50 individual mosquitoes and used for Vero cells infection. w.t. genetic background of the SL07 strain (E1-226A and E2-210L) to introduce the E2-L210Q substitution. no difference in dissemination efficiency between SL07 and SL07-210Q-Apa viruses was detected in galveston A. aegypti mosquitoes. BM indicates combined titers of CHIKV (E2-210L and E2-210Q) in blood meals used for mosquito infection. 293 cells were infected at multiplicity of 0.1 pfu/cell in triplicate. the effect of the E2-L210Q substitution on CHIKV fitness in 293 cells. the E2-L210Q substitution acts by increasing CHIKV infectivity for midgut cells of A. albopictus. it was suggested that efficient CHIKV infection of and replication in midgut cells promotes more active CHIKV dissemination and transmission. CHIKV does not require infection of and replication within midgut epithelium to disseminate to other organs and tissues. the initial infection/replication of the midgut epithelium is a major site of selection of the substitution in A. albopictus. we first compared infection rates of mosquitoes presented orally with serial dilutions of SL07 or SL07-226V-210Q viruses. the E2-210Q residue was associated with significantly higher infectivity for A. albopictus (Thailand) at the blood meal titers of 3.5 and 2.5 Log10(pfu)/mL, and the oral infectious dose 50% (OID50) value calculated for SL07-226V-210Q was the difference in the infection rates between SL07-226V and SL07-226V-210Q viruses was tested with a two-tailed Fishes exact test (B) the difference in the infection rates between SL07-226V and SL07-226V-210Q viruses was tested for significance with a two-tailed Fishes exact test (B) the modified SL07 i.c (contains nsP1-L407P and nsP3-T348A substitutions) was used to generate all CHIKV replicons used in the mosquito infectivity study. the modified SL07 i.c (contains nsP1-L407P and nsP3-T348A substitutions) was packaged into VLPs using w.t. SL07 help representative image showing number of GFP- and CFP-expressing cells in individual midguts infected with CFP/210Q/226V and CFP/210L/226A VLPs at 1 and 2 dpi. each dot corresponds to a fold-difference in the number of cells expressing GFP vs. CFP [E2-210 (Q/L) or CFP vs. GFP [E1-226 (V/A)] in individual midgut infectious viruses were not recovered after infecting vero cells with homogenates of 30 mosquitoes infected with VLPs mixes. the hypothetical formation of full-length viruses via recombination between helper and replicon RNAs did not occur. we also compared the effect of the previously characterized E1-A226V substitution on CHIKV infectivity for midguts of A. albopictus. the E2-L210Q substitution exerts significantly stronger selection compared to E2-L210Q. the substitution caused a 2.3\u20132.4-fold increase in CHIKV infectivity for A. albopictus midgut cells. this was about 17.5 times weaker than the effect of the E2-L210Q substitution in the same genetic background. a reverse genetics approach based on the SL-CK1 strain of CHIKV (hereafter abbreviated SL07), isolated in 2007 in Sri Lanka. the SL07 isolate was passed only twice on Vero cells since its isolation from a febrile patient. a clone with the single E1-A226V substitution (SL07-226V) was genetically marked by introducing a synonymous mutation 6454AC that creates an ApaI restrictase site (SL07-226V-Apa) the infectious viruses SL07-226V-Apa and SL07-226V-210Q were rescued by electroporation of in vitro-transcribed RNA into vero cells. A. albopictus (Thailand strain) was presented with blood meals containing 5x105 plaque forming units (pfu)/mL of SL07-226V-Apa and 5x105 pfu/mL of SL07-226V-210Q viruses (combined titer 106 pfu/mL) and 10 days post-infection (dpi) the presence of disseminated viral infection as sampled from cell culture supernatants were collected for viral RNA extraction and processed as described in the Materials and Methods. no detectable differences in viral fitness (changes in the ratio of the 2 viruses) were observed after vero cell passage. BM indicates combined titers of competitors in blood meals used for mosquito infection. early studies of CHIKV competence to infect A. albopictus demonstrated significant variation in susceptibility among different geographic strains. we also compared dissemination efficiency of the SL07-226V-Apa versus SL07-226V-210Q viruses in mosquitoes derived from Galveston, USA. the SL07-226V-210Q virus alone was detected in 31.6% of mosquitoes after 3 alternating mosquito-Vero passages. SL07-226V-Apa (w.t.) alone was found in 52.6% of mosquitoes. 15.8% of mosquitoes had both competitors in their heads and legs. ucine (210L), glutamine (210Q) or both residues (210L/210Q) in mosquito heads and legs after third passage in A. albopictus (representing disseminated infections) the original mixture was not quantified because the PCR-restriction digest assay cannot detect a minority population present at only 1% frequency. the substitution does not alter CHIKV fitness in A. aegypti or human cells. competition between SL07-226V-210Q-Apa and SL07-226V viruses was also analyzed in Thailand A. aegypti. results indicate that it is unlikely that polymorphism at E2-210 affects CHIKV transmission by A. aegypti. at 2 dpi, supernatants were collected for RNA extraction and RT-PCR analysis. the relative fitness (RF) within a given competition was determined as the average ratio between E2-210L and E2-210Q bands in the sample (r), divided by the starting ratio of E2-210L and E2-210Q bands in the inoculum (i) used for infection. Alternatively, E2-L210Q could have been selected as a result of CHIKV adaptation to we first compared the relative ratios of SL07-226V-Apa and SL07-226V-210Q RNAs in whole mosquitoes, mosquito midguts and mosquito carcasses. similar increases in the relative amount of E2-210Q RNAs in mosquito midguts were observed as early as day 1 post infection. CHIKV does not require infection of and replication within mosquito midguts to disseminate to other organs and tissues. at 1, 2, 3 (B and C) and 7 dpi (A) whole mosquito bodies (A), carcasses without midguts (A), or midguts (A, B and C) were collected in pools of ten. BM indicates combined titers of competitors in blood meals used for mosquito infection. SL07-226V-210Q was 8.9 times lower (higher infectivity) than that for SL07-226V. earlier studies found that the well-established A. albopictus-adaptive substitution E1-A226V mediates a much greater, 100-fold decrease in OID50 values [6], [9]. replicon VLPs are capable of primary infection and replicon RNA replication within cells, but cannot spread to neighboring cells due to the lack of the structural genes in the replicon. this allowed us to investigate the effect of mutations of interest on initial infection of midgut cells. we switched to BHK-21 cells that have superior RNA susceptibility compared to vero cells. replicon expressing cherry fluorescent protein (CFP) was packaged into VLPs using a helper encoding E2-210L and E1-226V residues. the infectious titers of all recovered VLPs, as determined by titration on vero cells, were identical. the difference between strains expressing E2-L210Q and E1-A226V residues on VLP infectivity was compared for significance with a two-tailed Studens t-test. at 1 and 2 dpi, midgut cells were 4\u20135 times more likely to become infected with VLPs expressing the E2-210Q residue compared with VLPs expressing E2-210L. the replicon was packaged using a helper encoding E2-210L and E1-226A residues (CFP/E2-210L/E1-226V) the valine residue at position E1-226 provided a far greater (41-43 fold) increase in a midgut cell infection compared to the alanine residue at the same position (Figure 6C, 6D, 6E), which agrees with previous results using infectious viruses [36]. w.t. SL07 helper encoding E2-210L and E1-226A residues (GFP/E2-210L/E1-226A) the E2-L210Q substitution caused a 2.3\u20132.4-fold increase in CHIKV infectivity for A. albopictus midgut cells. this was about 17.5 times weaker than the effect of the E1-A226V substitution in the same genetic background. an E2-L210Q substitution recently identified in CHIKV populations of Kerala State, India. the substitution confers a selective advantage by increasing initial infection of A. albopictus midgut epithelial cells. however, the E2-L210Q substitution has no apparent effect on CHIKV fitness in the other primary mosquito vector, A. aegypti. V to A. albopictus raise serious public health concerns that even more efficient transmission may exacerbate the already devastating CHIK epidemics in India and Southeast Asia. the introduction of the E2-L210Q strain into new areas like Italy and france could spread epidemics into temperate climates where A. albopictus thrives. residue E2-211I, which is common among CHIKV strains, blocks this effect. both positions are located at the C'B sheet of the CHIKV E2 protein. both positions are located on the virion surface on the lateral side of domain B. the 3-D model was analyzed using the PyMol molecular viewer [70]. only limited portions of CHIKV genomes including the nsP2, E2 and E1 genes were sequenced. this suggests that Kerala strains of CHIKV might have acquired adaptive substitutions in addition to E2-L210Q. E2-L210Q has an approximately 17-fold (E1-226A background) weaker effect compared with E1-A226V. the stronger fitness effect of E1-A226V is consistent with its historically faster selection, which resulted in a selective sweep in parts of the Indian Ocean, India and Southeast Asia. 2-210Q RNA in midguts infected with VLPs is almost indistinguishable from the relative increase in amount of E2-210Q RNA in midguts exposed to infectious viruses. no differences were observed in CHIKV replication in A. albopictus bodies after intrathoracic infection, suggesting that replication of CHIKV in secondary mosquito organs also is unaffected by residue E2-210. SL07 (SL-CK1) strain of CHIKV was isolated in 2007 from a human in Sri-Lanka. strain belongs to Indian subgroup of the IOL. a point mutation 6454AC (synonymous, ApaI marker) was introduced into the pRep-GFP construct. the helper plasmids were generated by deleting the 373\u20137270 nt. cDNA fragment from i.c. of SL07 that has mutations of interest at E1-226 and E2-210. colonies of A. albopictus and A. aegypti mosquitoes were established from mosquito eggs collected in Bangkok, Thailand. all manipulations and handling of mosquitoes were done as described previously [67] s (1x106 cells/well) of uninfected Vero cells in six-well plates. after 2 h of incubation at 37\u00b0C, cells were overlaid with 0.5% agarose in MEM supplemented with 3.3% FBS. the results were expressed as pfu/g of electroporated RNA (Table S1). viral mutations at position E2-210 on CHIKV dissemination in a. albopictus and A. aegypti mosquitoes were analyzed using direct competition experiment. a pair of viruses that differ by mutations of interest in the E2 protein was mixed at a 11 ratio, with one containing the ApaI marker. one PCR band corresponded to disseminated infection for one out of two viruses in the pair. two bands indicated that both viruses disseminated in the same mosquito. differences in dissemination efficiencies were tested with a one-tailed McNemar test. RNA from 2 pools, 5 mosquitoes/pool, was extracted at 1 and 2 dpi. RNA was RT-PCR amplified, followed by ApaI restrictase digestion of amplicons. CHIKV was detected by observing virus-induced CPE. the oral infectious dose 50% (OID50) values were calculated using the PriProbit program (version 1.63) for VLP experiments, A. albopictus (Thailand) were infected with 11 mixes (based on i.u. titers) of GFP- or CFP-expressing subgenomic replicons packaged into VLPs using CHIKV helpers that differed by substitutions at positions E1-226 and E2-210. CHIKV competition in vero and 293 cells was observed daily for signs of CPE for 5 days. cells were infected at a multiplicity 0.1 pfu/cell in triplicate with 11 mixtures of [SL07-226V-Apa and SL07-226V-210Q] and [SL07-226V and SL07-226V-210Q-Apa] viruses. cells were maintained at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2 in M a point mutation 6454AC (synonymous, ApaI marker) was introduced into the i.c. of SL07 using conventional PCR-based cloning methods. the PCR-generated regions were completely sequenced. the plasmids were generated by electroporation of the SL07 i.c. into BHK-21 cells. cells and mosquitoes Vero cells were propagated at 37\u00b0C. 5% CO2 in fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 293 (Human Embryonic Kidney) cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 in MEM-alpha. ovitz L-15 (L-15) medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 5% tryptose phosphate broth. at 3 h post electroporation the cell supernatant was replaced with 14 mL of L-15 medium and maintained at 37 \u00b0C without CO2. aliquot containing 1x105 electroporated Vero cells was serially ten-fold diluted. cells were allowed to attach to sub-confluent monolayers (1x106 helper RNA were mixed and electroporated into 107 BHK-21(S) cells. cells were maintained in L-15 medium at 37\u00b0C, followed by harvesting supernatants at 30 h post-electroporation. monolayers were infected with 10-fold dilutions of the samples for 1 h at 37\u00b0C, followed by adding 2 mL of MEM. supernatant from virus-induced CPE (cytopathic effect)-positive wells was used for RNA extraction followed by RT-PCR with 41855ns-F5 (5-ATATCTAGACATGGTGGAC) and 41855ns-R1 (5-TATCAAAGGAGTATGTC) primers sets using one-Step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) RNA from 2 pools, 5 mosquitoes/pool, was extracted at 1 and 2 dpi. at 10 dpi, heads and legs of individual mosquitoes were processed. RNA from 2 pools, 5 mosquitoes/pool, was extracted at 1 and 2 dpi. the SL07-226V and SL07-226V-210Q viruses individually were serially 10-fold diluted, mixed with defibrinated sheep blood and presented orally to A. albopictus (Thailand) at 10 dpi individual mosquitoes were triturated in one mL of MEM and used to infect 5x104 Vero cells in duplicate in 96 well plates. the difference in the infection rates between SL07-226V and SL replicon and helper RNAs did not recombine to generate infectious virus capable of autonomous replication. 30 mosquitoes were infected with VLPs mixes and at 7 dpi were triturated in 1 mL of MEM, filter sterilized and 300 L of homogenate was used to infect each of 3 wells of confluent Vero cells. after 1 h of infection at 37\u00b0C, 2 mL of MEM was added to each well, the effect of the E2-L210Q substitution on CHIKV fitness in vero cells. above each figure is a schematic representation of the viruses used in the competition assay. asterisks indicate authentic (w.t.) residues for the SL07 strain at the indicated positions. the difference in number of mosquitoes with E2-210L versus E2-210Q residues was tested with a one-tailed McNemar test. the difference in number of mosquitoes with E2-210L versus E2-210Q residues was tested for significance with a one-tailed McNemar test. the presence of disseminated E2-210L and E2-210Q CHIKV infection was assayed as described in the Materials and Methods. the difference in numbers of mosquitoes with E2-210L versus E2-210Q residues was tested for significance with a one-tailed McNemar test."}
