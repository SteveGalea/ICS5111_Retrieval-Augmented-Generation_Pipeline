{"summary": "influenza has caused a number of pandemics as a result of novel strains circulating in the general population. global influenza infection rates are estimated to include 5\u201310% of all adults and 20\u201330% of children annually during a non-epidemic year2. programs to vaccinate a large portion of the population are carried out each year in countries such as the united states. 150\u2013160 million vaccines are produced annually for use in the united states. there are 130 national influenza centers (NIC) in 101 countries13. these centers are tasked with analyzing clinically-confirmed influenza cases. they are then forwarded to one of five WHO Collaborating Centers. the strains selected for inclusion in the vaccine reflect highly educated guesses of the strains that will be most representative in the upcoming flu season. early estimates of the 2014\u20132015 flu season in the united states indicate overall vaccine effectiveness at just 23% due to genetically drifted H3N2 strains in circulation15. the CDC oversees a federal influenza surveillance program. the current initiative includes subtyping, antigenic characterization, and antiviral resistance testing. there is also information on influenza-associated hospitalizations and outpatient influenza-like illness18. a strain recommended by the WHO for inclusion in the respective flu seasons in the northern Hemisphere21, 22 from the IRD23. in order to compare the sequences with those contained within the vaccine, we collected a strain recommended by the WHO for inclusion in the respective flu seasons. we aligned sequences for each virus subtype from each season with the sequences representing the subtype contained in that year\u2019s vaccine. we used the default parameters (Algorithm = auto, Scoring Matrix = 200PAM / k = 2, Gap Open Penalty = 1.53, Offset Value = 0.123) we determined that 49.2% and 50.2% of our cases were vaccinated for the 2012\u20132013 and 2013\u20132014 flu seasons respectively. the lack of control individuals here makes calculation of vaccine effectiveness and efficacy26 impossible. 2013\u20132014 flu season by HHS Region, indicated in boldface. background color is represented by column C|VS+,Y in Table 3. genetic variation is represented in number of SNPs compared to strain vaccinated against. Variation peaked for H1N1 in Region 3 with n = 4 cases and an average of 30.8 2.8 SNPs and was smallest in Region 4 with an average of 28.8 2.1 SNPs in n = 42 cases. only Regions 3, 4, and 6 had any H3N2 cases, with n = 1, n = 2, and n = 3, respectively. influenza B showed 28.5 2.1 SNPs (39% nonsynonymous) from their respective reference sequences. the genetic variation between cases and the strains vaccinated against was highest in the 2012\u20132013 influenza B cases and the 2013\u20132014 influenza A/H3N2 cases. this improved reporting of vaccination status made it possible to reliably compare the statuses with genetic variation for the 2013\u20132014 season. a bold step such as regionalization of vaccines to better capture and protect against representative virus strains in circulation may prove beneficial to millions of individuals. oseltamivir resistance was seen in 0.7% (n = 687), 0.2% (n = 2,440) and 0.0% (n = 1,044) of tested H1N1, H3N2 and influenza B samples tested during the 2012\u20132013 flu season31. the authors recognize several limitations of this study. these include the lack of control data that could have been used to measure true efficacy and effectiveness of the vaccines. a random HA sample for each of the strains vaccinated against would have been invaluable for geographic accuracy and reliability of this study. an innovative combination of viral genetic data with clinical records would certainly fall under the umbrella of the Precision Medicine Initiative32. this would certainly fall under the umbrella of the Precision Medicine Initiative32, especially in relation to resistance of oseltamivir. data demonstrating a differentiated diffusion of strains with particular mutations that are indicated for antiviral resistance could inform physicians of optimal treatments. this could show expected trends in viral properties among patients entering the health centers with acute respiratory illnesses, increasing efficacy of care and reducing healthcare costs."}
