{"summary": "92 articles published during the last 25 years describe experimental and clinical studies of the potential associations of microbiota and epigenetic aberrations with the risk of B cell lymphoma in SS patients. the occurrence of lymphoma in more than 15% of SS patients may be the end result of a combination of genetics, epigenetics, and dysbiosis. pathogenesis relies on aberrant activation of the immune system against self-epitopes. in a minority of cases, SS can progress to B cell lymphoma, usually a mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. studies of patients and experimental models of SS have described oral and gut dysbiosis in terms of its bacterial composition. there are no data concerning microorganisms such as viruses. latent viral infections or retroelements integrated in host DNA may impair epigenetic machinery and prime cells to develop a proinflammatory or neoplastic phenotype. ALT Lymphoma SS is a chronic autoimmune \u201cepithelitis\u201d whose pathogenesis seems to be triggered by an environmental agent acting on a permissive genetic background. microbial agents may induce an aberrant activation of innate and adaptive immunity against mucosal epithelial cells which contribute to the inflammatory cascade. Adaptive immunity is the most involved part of the immune response, and B lymphocytes are the hallmark of the disease. the association with IRF5 highlights its presumable role in the pathogenesis of SS insofar as this mediator is involved in both viral infections and lymphomagenesis. some studies have shown that IRF5 may induce a permissive background to latent viral infections such as those due to EBV and favours the process of B cell transformation into malignant clones. glandular epithelial cells undergo proinflammatory processes that recruit cells belonging to both innate and acquired immunity. B lymphocytes are responsible for cytokine release, antigen presentation, and the production of autoantibodies in a T cell-dependent or T cell-independent manner. the release of large amounts of antibodies in the circulation leads to the deposition of immune complexes. polymorphic variants in the BAFF gene promoter were associated to an incremental risk of developing lymphoma in SS patients. the variant His159Tyr in the BAFF gene promoter conferring a high risk compared to healthy controls. a similar study showed that the variant His159Tyr in the BAFF gene was associated with SS and SS-associated MALT lymphoma, especially in younger patients. both Th17 and Th1 lymphocytes foment inflammation and favour the synthesis of other proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines by immune and epithelial cells. however, the production of IL-6 by B cells stimulates the differentiation of the Th17 phenotype, thus providing a loop. salivary epithelial gland cells recognize viral genome by means of intracellular TLR3 and induce the expression of CD40, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), MHC class I, and BAFF. the activation of the innate immune system via the TLR pathway has also been found in proteomic studies of SS patients' saliva. a salivary proteomic profile has been observed in a SS patient developing a MALT lymphoma [28]. authors found 22 differentially methylated genes in 5% of SS patients developing a B cell lymphoma. the different expression of genes related to intracellular pathogen infections (TLRs, the IFN pathway) in transformed B lymphocytes reinforces the hypothesis of a crosslink between infections, epigenetics, and lymphomagenesis. the calcium pathway is involved in oxidative stress and the unfolded protein response due to rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) stress. it has been demonstrated that salivary gland epithelial cells have a phenotype characterized by RER stress and altered mucin protein secretion. it may be related to unfolded proteins retained in the RER that may activate innate responses through the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells methylation of CpG islands is the main mechanism underlying the inactivation of the X chromosome in females. the X chromosome inactivation process depends on LINE1 sequences, and aberrant epigenetic changes may occur in the case of unusual insertions or transpositions of a foreign genomic material. ALT lymphoma may have a distinct epigenetic pathway from MALT lymphoma. micro-RNAs are small noncoding RNA filaments that are 19-23 nucleotides in length and control gene expression mainly by pairing the 3\u2032untraslated region (3\u2032UTR) of target mRNAs. micro-RNA 146a/b, the 17-92 cluster, and 181a expression in SS patients. micro-RNAs such as EBV micro-RNA 181a may be overexpressed in infected cells. it favours cell survival and proliferation, thus paving the way for the development of proliferative disease. a variation in gut flora has been associated with an imbalance in the Th17/T regulator cell ratio. ally mutated microorganisms and favourable genetic background in host cells may alter this balance and induce dysbiosis. dysbiosis is characterized by the emergence of pathogenic phyla. it may elicit sterile inflammation and prime the innate and acquired immune system. a study of 82 SS patients found a significant increase in anti-EBV early antigen (EBVEA) immunoglobulin G (IgG) which is indicative of a lytic infection. EBVEA is structurally and functionally similar to protooncogene B cell lymphoma 2 (bcl-2), which is involved in cell proliferation and survival and carcinogenesis. cellular genome also contains retroelements or latent viral insertions that may activate inflammasomes. most cannot retrotranscribe but they can affect the transcription of genes adjacent to their insertional site. NLRP3 is activated by 5\u2032 uncapped nucleic acids that belong to pathogens such as viruses or damaged cells. reactivation of L1 retroelements relies on different patterns of methylation. it has been shown that minor salivary gland tissues from SS patients have an increased methylation in L1 elements and a concomitantly reduced expression of some methylating enzymes. there is still a lack of studies in SS patients or experimental models. experimental mice have shown that infection with murine cytomegalovirus is followed by the development of salivary gland infiltrates with undetectable virus. multiple consecutive infections may epigenetically modify target cells to develop a final cancerous or proinflammatory phenotype. the most frequent SS-associated lymphoma is MALT lymphoma [80] a study of human coronavirus 229E- (HCoV-229E-) infected A549 and HuH7 cells found that TNFAIP3 was typically upregulated in order to guarantee efficient viral replication. a study involving homozygous 564Igi+/+ mice showed no lymphocytic expansion, risk of lymphoma, hypergammaglobulinemia or autoimmune diseases. anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB autoantibody titres or autoantibody positivity is associated with an increased risk of B cell lymphoma in SS patients. a fascinating alternative to chronic infectious stimulation of B cells is the possibility of alterations in gene transcription due to transposable retroviral elements. a recent RNA sequencing experiment analysed the behaviour of HERVs in murine and human B cells in various pathological contexts. the authors examined HERV transcriptome under infectious, autoimmune, and neoplastic conditions and found that LINE transcription was slightly enhanced in sepsis. the HERVs expressed in transformed B cells did not have the same sequence as those expressed in B cells activated by an inflammatory stimulus. epigenetic induction of transcription of genes associated to microbial recognition (e.g., TLR3 and TLR7) and IFN-I signature may further promote the hyperactivation of B cells in response to foreign or endogenous epitopes, generated by bacteria, viruses, and endogenous retroelements. pathogenesis seems to be triggered by an environmental agent acting on a permissive genetic background. microbial agents may induce aberrant activation of innate and adaptive immunity against mucosal epithelial cells. Adaptive immunity is the most involved part of the immune response, and B lymphocytes are the hallmark of the disease. the association with IRF5 highlights its presumable role in the pathogenesis of SS insofar as this mediator is involved in both viral infections and lymphomagenesis. some studies have shown that IRF5 may induce a permissive background to latent viral infections such as those due to EBV and favours the process of B cell transformation into malignant clones. omagenesis may represent the attempt of the immune system to counteract a chronic infection. glandular epithelial cells undergo proinflammatory processes that recruit cells belonging to both innate and acquired immunity. B lymphocytes are responsible for cytokine release, antigen presentation, and the production of autoantibodies in a T cell-dependent or T cell-independent manner. polymorphic variants in the BAFF gene promoter confer a high risk of developing lymphoma in SS patients. the variant His159Tyr in the BAFF gene promoter conferring a high risk compared to healthy controls. a similar study showed that the variant His159Tyr in the BAFF gene was associated with SS and SS-associated MALT lymphoma. IL-17, a cytokine that lies at the basis of autoimmunity, can transdifferentiate into a Th1 phenotype depending on the cytokine milieu. both Th17 and Th1 lymphocytes foment inflammation and favour the synthesis of other proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines by immune and epithelial cells. however, the production of IL-6 by B cells stimulates the differentiation of the Th17 phenotype. salivary epithelial gland cells recognize viral genome by means of intracellular TLR3 and induce the expression of CD40, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), MHC class I, and BAFF. the activation of the innate immune system via the TLR pathway has also been found in proteomic studies of SS patients' saliva. a salivary proteomic profile has been observed in a SS patient developing a MALT lymphoma [28]. the authors found 22 differentially methylated genes in 5% of the SS patients developing a B cell lymphoma. the different expression of genes related to intracellular pathogen infections (TLRs, the IFN pathway) in transformed B lymphocytes reinforces the hypothesis of a crosslink between infections, epigenetics, and lymphomagenesis. the calcium pathway is involved in oxidative stress and the unfolded protein response due to rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) stress. it has been demonstrated that salivary gland epithelial cells have a phenotype characterized by RER stress and altered mucin protein secretion. it may be related to unfolded proteins retained in the RER that may activate innate responses through the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells methylation of CpG islands is the main mechanism underlying the inactivation of the X chromosome in females. the X chromosome inactivation process depends on LINE1 sequences, and aberrant epigenetic changes may occur in case of unusual insertion or transposition of a foreign genomic material. micro-RNAs are small noncoding RNA filaments that are 19-23 nucleotides in length and control gene expression mainly by pairing the 3\u2032untraslated region (3\u2032UTR) of target mRNAs. micro-RNAs are small noncoding RNA filaments that are 19-23 nucleotides in length and control gene expression mainly by pairing the 3\u2032untraslated region. micro-RNAs such as EBV micro-RNA 181a may be overexpressed in infected cells and favour cell survival and proliferation. the expression of micro-RNA 155, which is involved in B cell growth, is enhanced in lymphomas, and its overexpression may be driven by EBV infection through two EBV-encoded proteins. the human microbiome is now widely considered an independent organ per se that is capable of interacting with host cells. ms and favourable genetic background in host cells may alter this balance. dysbiosis is characterized by the emergence of pathogenic phyla. it may elicit sterile inflammation and prime the innate and acquired immune system. the virus infects hematopoietic and epithelial cells and escapes clearance by the immune system by expressing different antigens at different stages of the infection. it expresses six EBNAs which immortalise B lymphocytes by preventing the activation of the p53 pathway or enhancing kinase activity. a study of 82 SS patients found a significant increase in anti-EBV early antigen (EBVEA) immunoglobulin G human virome may induce bacterial dysbiosis, which is associated with the development of autoimmune diseases such as inflammatory bowel diseases. cellular genome also contains retroelements or latent viral insertions that may activate inflammasomes. most cannot retrotranscribe but they can affect the transcription of genes adjacent to their insertional site. reactivation of L1 retroelements relies on different patterns of methylation. it has been shown that minor salivary gland tissues from SS patients have an increased methylation in L1 elements and a concomitantly reduced expression of some methylating enzymes. there is still uncertainty about their role in triggering the disease or its complications. experimental mice have shown that infection with murine cytomegalovirus is followed by the development of salivary gland infiltrates with undetectable virus. multiple consecutive infections may epigenetically modify target cells to develop a final cancerous or proinflammatory phenotype. risk of B cell lymphoma increases with the duration of SS. spleen sections of mutant and wild-type mice did not show any changes in marginal zone architecture, the starting point of MALT lymphomas in SS patients. this may be explained by differences in the anatomical sites of emergence of malignant B cells, usually the surrounding oral mucosa in SS patients. anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB autoantibody titres or autoantibody positivity is associated with an increased risk of B cell lymphoma in SS patients. a fascinating alternative to chronic infectious stimulation of B cells is the possibility of alterations in gene transcription due to transposable retroviral elements. HERVs expressed in transformed B cells did not have the same sequences as those expressed in B cells activated by an inflammatory stimulus. SS has been reported in four patients treated with ipilimumab and nivolumab, although none of the patients was positive for anti-Ro/SSA antibodies. pathogenesis of SS is due to interactions between a favourable genetic background and an environmental trigger such as infections or dysbiosis. the pathogenesis of SS is due to interactions between a favourable genetic background and an environmental trigger such as infections. the establishment of lymphoma in more than 15% of SS patients may be the end result of a combination of genetics, epigenetics, dysbiosis, or latent infections. there is still a lack of studies specifically investigating their precise role in the pathogenesis of SS and SS-associated B cell lymphoma."}
