{"summary": "EBOV is a member of the genus Ebolavirus within the Filoviridae family of highly pathogenic viruses. these viruses cause a severe hemorrhagic fever syndrome in humans and non-human primates. this outbreak has generated renewed emphasis on the development and approval of safe, effective prophylactics and therapeutics against the virus. studies have investigated the ability of type I interferons (IFNs) to decrease EBOV morbidity and mortality with mixed results. the combination of type I IFN with three monoclonal antibodies against EBOV glycoprotein (GP) provided robust protection against lethal challenge. IFN blocks EBOV and EBOV GP/rVSV infection of primary macrophages. mice were treated for 48 hours with either granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) were consistently more permissive for EBOV infection than GM-CSF-treated cells. the addition of cytokines TNF and IFN to macrophages has been shown to generate a proinflammatory M1 phenotype. evidence that the combination of these cytokines or IFN alone elicited an M1 phenotype of our isolated macrophages. all infections were assessed 24 hours following addition of virus. recombinant infectious vesicular stomatitis virus (EBOV GP/rVSV) is frequently used to study filovirus biology [21\u201325]. murine IFN reduced EBOV infection in a dose-dependent manner. 20 pg/mL of IFN inhibiting more than 70% of infection. the ability of IFN, but not TNF, to inhibit virus infection was also demonstrated in human macrophages. peritoneal macrophages were harvested from interferon / receptor knockout mice (IFNAR-/-) and cultured for 24 hours with M-CSF or M-CSF plus IFN prior to infection. IFN treatment of BALB/c or C57BL/6 IFNAR-/- macrophages inhibited virus infection. IFN inhibition of EBOV RNA levels in infected mouse macrophages. mice were treated with IFN for 24 hours and monitored for viral RNA accumulation via qRT-PCR. after 2 hours of infection, IFN treatment had no significant effect on the quantity of VSV matrix (M) or polymerase (L) RNA detected. IFN treatment decreases EBOV RNA levels to the same extent as the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. total RNA isolated at 6 or 14 hours following EBOV infection of M-CSF cultured peritoneal macrophages treated with or without IFN. RNA levels equally and the combination of inhibitors did not further reduce EBOV RNA production (Fig 2B) similar results were observed with EBOV GP/rVSV infections harvested at 6 hours (S4 Fig) gene arrays identified IFN-enhanced expression of ISGs known to be primary-response genes. a number of chemokines (CXCL9, CXCL10, CCL8 and CXCL11) and complement components (C1s and C1r) were also highly upregulated by IFN. RNA obtained for the microarray analysis was assessed for mRNA levels of the selected genes by qRT-PCR. results are represented as the log2 values. IFN-stimulated genes inhibit EBOV GP/rVSV infection. amount of IRF1 expression and infection (by detection of VSV polymerase) was quantified by qRT-PCR. results represent the means s.e.m. delivery of IRF1 siRNA containing exosomes knocked down IRF1 mRNA levels by approximately 50% in both M-CSF- and M-CSF/IFN-treated macrophages. additional less well-characterized ISGs that were highly upregulated in our gene array studies were also assessed for their ability to directly control virus infection. IFN administered by i.p. injection 24 hours prior to, 2 or 6 hours after a lethal dose of EBOV GP/rVSV protected mice against lethal challenge. however, IFN administered 48 hours after challenge did not protect mice against lethal challenge. intraperitoneal IFN treatment of mice significantly inhibits EBOV GP/rVSV infection of peritoneal cells. peritoneal cells were isolated from EBOV GP/rVSV infected mice treated with 3.3g of IFN at times noted prior to or following challenge. peritoneal cells were isolated 24 hours after EBOV GP/rVSV infection. splenic virus loads were higher in the mice, suggesting some virus had trafficked to the spleen by 2 hours following inoculation. the survival of the 2-hour IFN post-treatment mice was not significantly different from the PBS-treated, VSV infected mice. this finding stands in contrast to the robust protection IFN conferred at 2, 6 and 12 hours following EBOV GP/rVSV challenge. previous studies have demonstrated that IFN treatment administered by intramuscular injection allows for slower release and an extended half-life of the drug. all IFN-treated mice, regardless of time of treatment, had significantly less morbidity and mortality than untreated, infected mice. lower MA-EBOV viremia levels were observed in the 24 hour post challenge treated mice. mouse peritoneal macrophages treated for 48 hours with either GM-CSF or macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) support robust infection by a recombinant EBOV (formerly Zaire EBOV) that expresses green fluorescent protein (GFP) BALB/c peritoneal macrophages were infected with EBOV-GFP (MOI = 0.05 in Vero E6 cells) 24 hours following infection. IFN inhibits EBOV in a dose-dependent manner. EBOV GP/rVSV treatment of peritoneal macrophages did not inhibit EBOV GP/rVSV replication. addition of IFN prevented infection in either BALB/c or C57BL/6 peritoneal macrophages. GP/rVSV replication by about 10-fold and 20 ng/mL reduced titers. we determined if human IFN inhibits EBOV GP/rVSV infection of an in vivo matured macrophage population, human alveolar macrophages. IFN treatment had no effect on EBOV GP/rVSV viral titers in IFNR-/- cells. the type II IFN receptor is required for IFN-mediated inhibition of virus infection. macrophages from EBOV GP/rVSV were highly permissive to EBOV GP/rVSV. IFN blocks EBOV GP/rVSV and EBOV RNA synthesis. total RNA from IFN-treated or untreated peritoneal macrophages at indicated time points was assessed by qRT-PCR for VSV matrix (M) and polymerase (L) RNA. subsequent viral genome replication requires viral protein production and replication of the genome is blocked by inhibitors of protein synthesis such as cycloheximide (CHX) we compared the ability of IFN and CHX to inhibit viral RNA production. gene arrays were performed in IFN-treated alveolar macrophages. 45 genes were identified to have altered expression. the top IFN-upregulated genes in our arrays are involved in immune responses. sponse genes, such as the transcription factors IRF1 and IRF9, and more poorly studied secondary-response ISGs. chemokines (CXCL9, CXCL10, CCL8 and CXCL11) and complement components (C1s and C1r) were also highly upregulated by IFN [14, 16, 17, 38]. ISGs that inhibit EBOV GP/rVSV also block EBOV infection. lentiviral constructs expressed an ISG and red fluorescent protein (RFP) were assessed for inhibition of EBOV GP/rVSV. transfection of the construct expressing IRF1 strongly inhibited EBOV GP/rVSV and EBOV replication. we also assessed if knock down of IRF1 in M-CSF-treated and M-CSF/IFN-treated macrophages altered infection. expression of STAT1 only modestly inhibited EBOV GP/rVSV infection. control of STAT1 activity is primarily regulated by its phosphorylation status. in vivo IFN treatment protects IFNAR-/- mice against lethal i.p. challenge. at 10 g IFN dose, we assessed survival of mice when IFN was given at 12 and 48 hours after challenge. IFN administered 48 hours following EBOV GP/rVSV did not protect mice against lethal challenge. toneal cells were isolated from EBOV GP/rVSV infected mice treated with 3.3g of IFN at times noted prior to or following challenge. intramuscular administration of IFN increases survival of IFNAR-/- mice. treated control cells, regardless of whether IFN was given 24 hours prior to, 2, 6 or 12 hours following challenge. findings suggest that active infection at the site of virus challenge is ongoing at 24 hours following infection. initial studies showed equivalent concentrations of VSV were more virulent in mice. injection 24 hours prior to EBOV GP/rVSV infection significantly protected against lethal challenge. IFN protects mice from lethal challenge with mouse-adapted EBOV (MA-EBOV) mice were administered 3 or 10 g of IFN i.p. and challenged i.p. with MA-EBOV. IFN treatment significantly reduces MA-EBOV viremia in mice treated 24 hours following infection. results represent mean clinical sickness scores s.e.m (n 7/treatment) recombinant strand RNA virus, EBOV GP/rVSV, has not been shown to control negative strand RNA virus infection. RES3 or VAMP5 has not been shown to control negative strand RNA virus infection. studies with this recombinant virus may serve as a safer alternative. studies have only begun to identify IFN-stimulated proteins that contribute to the control of EBOV infection. a subset of ISGs preferentially target negative strand RNA viruses. expression of IRF1 inhibited EBOV infection and this ISG served as a positive control in these experiments. to date, a limited number of ISGs has been identified to restrict EBOV infection. this includes tetherin, ISG15, RIG-I, STAT1 and STAT2. this ISG blocks EBOV GP-dependent entry. EBOV evades host innate immune signaling pathways through impaired type I and type II IFN signaling, dysregulated proinflammatory cytokine expression and suppression of DC maturation and T-cell activation. a reduction in viral antigen by as little as 2-fold appears to be the difference between the host survival and death during EBOV infection [68, 69]. IFNs have been used clinically as therapeutics against both hepatitis B and C infections [73, 74], but showed mixed efficacy against EBOV infection in NHPs [11\u201313] the established safety and effectiveness of IFN against these disorders and the ability of IFN to profoundly inhibit EBOV infection in these patients. all animal studies performed at TBRI in this study were approved by the TBRI IACUC under protocol #1445MU1. mice were obtained from the National Cancer Institute (Frederick, MD) and BALB/c IFN-/ receptor-deficient (IFNR-/-) mice were a kind gift from Dr. John Harty, NYU Langone Medical Center.
