{"summary": "inhibition IC50 assays can be easily adapted to a 96-well filter binding assay. a single nucleotide incorporation (SNI) assay can be particularly useful to determine if a NTP analog actually served as a substrate for the polymerases. chain-terminators, delayed chain-terminators, or stably incorporated analogs are difficult to study for toxicity as they could lead to little or no quantitative changes in DNA, RNA, or protein expression. biochemical assays to evaluate general and mitochondria toxicities of nucleoside/tide analogs. in-Cell ELISA cells are subjected to a Mito Stress Test. mitochondrial spare respiration capacity was measured. the quality of the above-mentioned biochemical assays relies heavily on the availability of high quality TP active forms. oside/tide analog\u2019s cytotoxicity is often directly related to its cellular level of the active TP metabolite. some nucleoside analogs are poorly phosphorylated in cells, such as balapiravir. balapiravir showed little or no toxicity in a large panel of cells tested. mitochondrial respiration has been used extensively to study mitochondrial toxins that directly impair the electron transport chain. it has not been used to study the nucleoside/tide analogs until recently. this assay provides a functional readout and does not require knowledge of the mechanism of action. nucleoside/tide analogs are generally evaluated for 5\u20138 days. some nucleoside analogs are poorly phosphorylated in cells, such as balapiravir. some nucleoside analogs are poorly phosphorylated in cells, such as balapiravir. mitochondrial DNA content assay has been widely used to study 2\u2032-deoxy nucleoside analogs. but it does not assess the effect of ribose nucleoside/tide analogs on mitochrondrial RNA synthesis. mitochondrial respiration has been regarded as the \u201cgold standard\u201d for the measurement of mitochondrial function. tor of mitochondrial DNA synthesis), 4\u2032-azido cytidine (inhibitor of mitochondrial RNA synthesis), and chloramphenicol (inhibitor of mitochondrial protein synthesis) this method makes it possible to identify whether mitochondria toxicity occurs at a lower drug concentration. PC-3 cells offer higher sensitivity and reproducibility than HepG2 cells. animal models with genetic mitochondrial abnormalities or humanized animals may be more sensitive to nucleoside/tide toxicity. chimeric TK-NOG mice grafted with humanized livers were more susceptible to mitochondria toxins than the wild-type animals. the author is an employee and shareholder of Gilead Sciences, Inc.
