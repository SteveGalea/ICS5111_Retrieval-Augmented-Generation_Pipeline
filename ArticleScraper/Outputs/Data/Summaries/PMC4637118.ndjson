{"summary": "active immunotherapy aims to administer appropriate tumor associated antigens. ex vivo loaded and stimulated DCs were initially used to achieve this response. however, the ex vivo generation and modification of DCs turned out to be a labor-intensive, time- and money-consuming procedure. DCs, macrophages, and B lymphocytes are the most professional and fulltime APCs. their specialized antigen capturing features are further evidenced by the notion of several antigen uptake receptors next to their unique capability to cross-present exogenous antigens to CD8+ T cells. immature DCs induce tolerance in order to avoid unwanted immune reactions against autoantigens (self). maturation trigger dictates the immune functions of the DCs. toll like receptors (TLRs), C type lectin receptors (CLRs), retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I) or nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD) like receptors (20, 21], (2) the direct interaction with cells such as B cells, T cells, natural killer (NKT) cells, (3) stimulation by cellular products like CD40 ligand (CD40L), IL-1, TNF, and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) and conventional DCs (cDCs) are subdivided into cDC1 and cDC2. cDC1 is orchestrated by IFN regulatory factor-8 (IRF8), basic leucine zipper ATF-like 3 transcription factor (BATF3) and nuclear factor regulated by interleukin-3 (NFIL3). cDCs were defined as CD11c+ MHC-II+ cells located in lymphoid as well as nonlymphoid tissues. cDCs were subdivided into CD8 + or CD4+ cDCs in mice versus CD1c (BDCA-1)+ or CD141 (BDCA-3)+ cDCs in human. human pDCs express different markers in different anatomical locations. IL-3R (CD123), CD303 (BDCA-2), and CD304 (BDCA-4). the murine moDCs express CD11b, CD11c, MHC-II, CD64, and FcR. the human counterparts all express high levels of MHC-II, CD11c, CD11b, CD24, CD1a, and

markers are MHC-IIhi and signal-regulatory protein (SIRP +) the only known pDC-specific conserved markers are IRF7/8 next to TLR7/9. cDC1 and cDC2 are best known for their ability to produce high amounts of type I IFN (IFN and IFN) in response to viral stimuli. pDCs play an important role in induction of tolerance owing to low expression of MHC and costimulatory molecules compared to their cDC counterparts. human LCs have been described to induce robust proliferation of naive allogeneic CD8+ T cells far more efficient than the CD14+ DCs through the secretion of IL-15 which promotes the differentiation of granzyme B+/perforin+ CTLs. the role of LCs seems to be dictated by environmental cues, rather than a preimprinted behavior. migratory DCs are able to cross-present exogenous antigens to CD8+ T cells. peptide-MHC complexes also known as 'cross-dressing' are also able to regulate their processing capacity. they can also control lysosomal degradation in order to preserve peptides. microbial agents trigger surface or intracellular Toll like receptors (TLRs), C type lectin receptors (CLRs), retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I) or nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD) like receptors. complex signaling networks are activated to trigger a specific set of receptors. phenotypically DCs are characterized by stellate cytoplasmic protrusions. their specialized antigen capturing features are further evidenced by the notion of several antigen uptake receptors next to their unique capability to cross-present exogenous antigens to CD8+ T cells. they are strategically positioned at body barriers and organ entry ports [16] activated DCs are considered to be immunogenic. they lose their endo- and phagocytic receptors and slow down antigen capture and processing rate. they also upregulate both \u201csignal two\u201d molecules to stimulate naive T cells. distinct antigens are able to trigger DC maturation via one or more of these pathways. this combination serves as a fingerprint that triggers a specific set of receptors. a final hallmark of their professionalism is represented by their differential anatomical locations, expression of different antigen processing capacities, and variable responses to maturation stimuli. plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) and conventional DCs (cDCs) are subdivided into cDC1 and cDC2. cDCs are defined by their fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand- (Flt3-L-) dependent development from hematopoietic stem cells into blood residing pre-cDCs and pDCs. both murine and human cDCs were defined as CD11c+ MHC-II+ cells located in lymphoid as well as nonlymphoid tissues. cDCs found in lymphoid tissue like bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes are called resident DCs and were subdivided into CD8 + or CD4+ cDCs in mice

Typically, CLRs recognize carbohydrate structures in a calcium-dependent manner and are involved in the recognition and internalization of many glycosylated self-antigens and pathogens. DNGR1 or CLEC9A, CADM1+, and XCR-1 have been identified. they are all conserved molecules across different species that are also mechanistically involved in the antigen cross-presentation process. targeting vaccines towards one of these receptors holds great promise for antitumor vaccination [39, 88]. targeted peptides with strong binding affinity and unlimited specificity could be generated via high-throughput library approaches. however, they can hinder multimerisation of monomers, create fusion products with lower thermostability, and hinder proper intracellular trafficking of the vaccine. scFvs offer higher specificity than short peptides but as they are larger in size, the chance that they disrupt the process of conformational changes to mediate membrane fusion increases. several studies have reported on the generation and subsequent use of nanobodies for APC targeting. this includes the development of nanobodies targeting CD206 to enabling selective targeting of the MMRhi M2 macrophage subset within solid tumors. intranodal administration of DC targeted LVs enhanced CD4+ T-cell proliferation, without functional nor therapeutic benefit compared to untargeted LVs. however, most receptors (DEC205, DEC206, DC-SIGN, DCIR2, LOX-1, CD11c, CD11b, Fc receptors, and MHC-II molecules) are not truly specific for one particular APC subset. 1 was targeted to CD206, a robust CTL response was induced in mice. a robust humoral but only moderate T-cell response was observed in adenocarcinoma patients. it is difficult to compare the different APC targeting studies since they were performed with very different vaccine moieties. gen-specific CD8+ T cells within the tumor draining lymph node were observed. these data implicate that the tumor draining lymph node is an appealing vaccine target for solid tumors. also skin DC networks have been targeted via the use of nanoencapsulated antigens. d TAAs are most often driven by a strong constitutive promoter with or without enhancer sequences. these include the cytomegalovirus, spleen focus forming virus, human polypeptide chain elongation factor-1, phosphoglycerate kinase, and ubiquitin C promoters. these promoters induce strong and ubiquitous expression of the transgene, but are more prone to promoter inactivation than cell specific promoters CLRs have been the focus of most APC targeted research in mice, nonhuman primates, and humans. Typically, CLRs recognize carbohydrate structures in a calcium-dependent manner. these receptors can facilitate antigen uptake, processing, antigen routing, and MHC-I and -II loading. the cross-presenting cDC1 subset is currently seen as one of the most suitable targets for antitumor immunotherapy. most studies target their vaccine by coupling it to a short peptide, a ligand, a mAb or carbohydrate. scFvs are most often linked to a spacer peptide or protease cleavable peptide that permits proper conformation of both the scFv domain and targetable vaccine. scFvs are most often linked to a spacer peptide or protease cleavable peptide that permits proper conformation of both the scFv domain and targetable vaccine. a first strategy is represented by rational point and domain mutations of the viral glycoprotein. this is exemplified by the DC-SIGN-specific targeting strategy. a final strategy to generate APC targeted LVs is based on the fact that binding and fusion functions of LVs can be separated over two distinct glycoproteins. intranodal administration of DC targeted LVs enhanced CD4+ T-cell proliferation, without functional nor therapeutic benefit compared to untargeted LVs. bacterial derived vectors or enzymes have been successfully used to target TAAs to DCs with subsequent maturation and induction of strong antitumor immunity. we want to elaborate in this section on the true meaning of DC (subtype) specific targeting for active antitumor vaccination. it has been questioned if it is really possible to target APCs \u201cactively\u201d as they are already specialized in the uptake of whatever antigen they encounter. LVs in terms of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell stimulation suggest that the \u201cactive\u201d APC targeting factor does account for better DC activation than \u201cpassive\u201d uptake of noninfectious LVs. targeting did turn out to be responsible for antigen presentation after Ab targeted vaccination in vivo. targeted delivery outperformed untargeted delivery after low dose administration. but more effector CD8+ T cells were induced with high doses of untargeted vaccine compared to targeted delivery. targeted delivery of TLR agonists reduced dose requirement by 100-fold. specific targeting is believed to allow the induction of a very specific fine-tuned immune response. this is exemplified by the presumed most favorable target for antitumor vaccination. cDC1 subset represents the main IL-12 producing population. cDCs have been shown to cross-present antigens on the one hand. however, when CLEC9A and XCR1 were targeted, this approach appeared potent to eradicate established melanomas [88, 138] targeting is believed to enhance the vaccine's immune stimulatory potential. the therapeutic outcome of the cDC and the cDC as well as pDC targeted vaccine was comparable but most importantly less strong than that of the broad tropism LV vaccine. there is no strong rationale to target one DC subset over another to prime TAA specific CTLs. additional in vivo studies with human DC subset specific targets are definitely needed to identify the most specialized DC subsets. the authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this review. the authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this review."}
