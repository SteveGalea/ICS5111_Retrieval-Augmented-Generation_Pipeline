{"summary": "lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) and LAMP2 constitute ca. 50% of the proteins in the lysosome membrane and function to maintain the structural integrity of lysosomal compartment. lysosomal rupture is reported to induce cell death through the release of hydrolytic lysosomal enzymes. a few manuscripts have revealed that NA was an important virus segment protein contributing to the virus pathogenesis both in vivo (mice and chickens) and in vitro (MDCK cells), and the sialidase activity of NA expressed in the infected cells was also detected in the lysosome (14). these findings suggest that in addition to its classical mechanism of releasing assembled virus particles from the cell membrane at the late stage of the viral life cycle, the NA of influenza virus may directly bind to L titers are expressed as the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50)/ml of supernatant. primary antibodies against LAMP1 (ab24170) (for immunofluorescence), cathepsin K (ab19027), M6PR (ab124767), and cathepsin L (ab58991) were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA) the anti-tubulin AF 488 kit, a peroxisome labeling kit for fixed cells, was procured from Merck (Billerica, MA) the anti-tubulin AF 488 kit, a peroxisome labeling kit for fixed cells, LysoTracker Red DND-99, and ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant with DAPI (4\u2032,6\u2032-diamidino-2-phenylindole) were purchased from Molecular Probe avian influenza virus genes polymerase complex PB1 (GenBank accession no.

tracheal epithelial cells decreased significantly after H5N1 virus infection. lysosomes in tracheal epithelial cells decreased significantly after H5N1 virus infection. cell survivals at 48 h postinfection were positively correlated to cellular lysosomal numbers before infection. in primary HTEpiC that were infected with either seasonal H1N1 or H5N1 influenza virus or treated with the vehicle allantoic fluid (AF) as a control at 24 h postinfection (h.p.i.). lysosome integrity is disrupted upon H5N1 virus infection. the fluorescence signal of each cell analyzed from 50 to 100 cells

decreased after H5N1 virus infection. we mutagenized each of the conserved catalytic amino acids and assessed the impact on interaction with the LAMPs. mutations of R98K, D131E, E258G, and Y382F in the NA catalytic pocket could markedly prevent deglycosylation of the LAMPs. 293T cells were transfected with NS1-flag, wild-type NA-flag, or mutant NA (E258G) encoding plasmids. lysates (input) and

catalytic activity of different strains may be different. studies have shown that avian H5N1 influenza virus NA protein induces lysosomal rupture. this may play an important role in early stage of virus life cycle. previous studies have shown that the time from influenza virus cell entry to new influenza virion production in cells is on average 6 h (29, 30) a549 cells were treated with PBS or

infection. the fluorescence signal of each cell analyzed from 50 to 100 cells is shown on the right. the colocalization rate of these two proteins was analyzed for 50 to 100 cells using Fluoview software. all scale bars indicate 50 m, and the data represent means the SEM of three independent experiments. a new tab LAMP1 and LAMP2 were significantly deglycosylated after H5N1 influenza virus infection. we also studied two genes that regulate lysosome functions. transcription factor EB (TFEB) is a master activator of lysosomal biogenesis. the protein levels of TFEB and M6PR were not affected significantly before 36 h after H5N1 influenza virus infection. the active cathepsin B, mature cathepsin D and cathepsin L proteins were slightly downregulated upon H5N1 virus infection at late stage. the expression level of ATP6V1A (ATPase, H+ transporting, lysosomal 70 kDa, V1 subunit A) also remained unchanged upon lysosomes stained with plasmids encoding NA of the H5N1 virus or vector were deglycosylated significantly after digestion by the glycosidase PNGase F. the decrease of the lysosomal numbers per cell was also confirmed using FACS analysis of cells transfected with the NA gene of the H5N1 virus. also, the NA protein of H5N1 virus could also induce more seriously LAMP1 and LAMP2 de MTS assay of cell viability of A549 cells transfected with control vector or

all scale bars indicate 50 m, and data represent means the SEM of three independent experiments. we further observed the colocalization of LAMP1 and NA of influenza virus as early as 3 h after live influenza virus infection in A549 cells. lectin I (MAL I) and lysosome marker LAMP1 were observed significantly decreased after H5N1 virus infection. the fluorescence intensity of sialic acid colocated with LAMP2 was observed significantly decreased after H5N1 virus infection. we mutagenized each of the conserved catalytic amino acids and assessed the impact on interaction with the LAMPs. 293T cells were transfected with NS1-flag, wild-type NA-flag, or mutant NA (E258G) encoding plasmids. the immunoprecipitation assay was performed with anti-flag antibody. the deglycosylation of LAMP1 and LAMP2 was analyzed by immunoblotting. activity assay evaluating 0.1 g of H1N1 or H5N1 influenza virus NA protein in different buffers (pH 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, or 7.4) at 37\u00b0C. the amounts of NA protein were also determined by immunoblot analysis. the extracellular region of LAMP2 fused to the human IgG-Fc fragment (LAMP2-Fc) and the control protein human IgG-Fc (Fc) were conjugated to protein A-be sosomes per cell in cells infected with the live H5N1 virus found that treatment with the NA inhibitors could ameliorate lysosomal rupture. these data demonstrate that the NA inhibitors peramivir and zanamivir could reduce the deglycosylation of LAMPs and protect from lysosomal rupture induced by influenza virus infection. avian H5N1 influenza virus NA protein induces lysosomal rupture. this may play an important role in early stage of virus life cycle. previous studies have shown that the time from influenza virus cell entry to new influenza virion production in cells is on average 6 h (29, 30) A549 cells were treated with PBS or the NA inhibitors peramivir (30 g/ml) and zanamivir (30 g/ml) 1 h before H1N1 or H5N1 virus infection and 4 h postinfection. the NP-positive nucleus was analyzed by confocal microscopy. the percentage of NP-positive nuclei were determined using ImageJ software. lysosome cell death could occur after lysosomal membrane permeabilization and leakage of lysosomal hydrolases. lysosome rupture could be induced by the deglycosylation of LAMP1 and LAMP2 after influenza virus infection. lysosome functions are critical maintaining mouse survival. the molecular basis for this phenomenon remains unknown. we have observed more severe LAMPs deglycosylation caused by H5N1 virus NA than by H1N1 virus NA. a higher enzyme activity for H5N1 influenza virus NA was detected."}
