{"summary": "the gastrointestinal tract functions as a filter with selective permeability to nutrients and as a defensive barrier that prevents the penetration of foreign entities. however, immune dysregulation can occur in the intestinal tract, which causes inappropriate stimulation of immune responses that can lead to inflammatory pathologies. gastrointestinal infections have been shown to initiate inflammation and increase gut barrier permeability. this circular pathway serves as a mechanism through which damaged gut tissue can lead to chronic enteric or systemic disease. the benefits of oral PPIs appear to be related to improvements in intestinal barrier function and microbiota stability. the aim of the current analysis was to evaluate the effects of PPIs on growth, feed intake, and the efficiency of converting feed into muscle mass across a number of domesticated species challenged with microbial pathogens or toxins. a keyword search strategy was used for the period between 1 January 1990 and 31 August 2012 to capture relevant articles that may not have been indexed under the terms used above. twenty-nine articles retrieved through this process were considered. subjects included pigs, cattle, poultry, and rodents. a total of 31 independent experiments or trials from the 29 publications were considered suitable for inclusion in this meta-analysis. study outcomes

inflammatory conditions caused by oral challenge with specific microbial pathogens or bacterial toxins. a study selection template was designed to consider which articles were to be included in the meta-analysis. a total of 31 independent experiments or trials from the 29 publications were considered suitable for inclusion in this meta-analysis. a total of 31 independent experiments or trials from the 29 publications were considered suitable for inclusion in this meta-analysis. individual study data were pooled by using the method of moments to estimate the variance between studies. the derived effect sizes were combined by using a random-effects model assuming that there was a random effect due to the published studies themselves. used, type and components of the PPI, and associated SDs (or SEs) were searched from 1980 through 2012. a keyword search strategy was used for the period between 1 January 1990 and 31 August 2012 to capture relevant articles that may not have been indexed under the terms used above. sources were established, we developed a data extraction file from the articles. the principal target estimates were mean effect of treatment, mean of the control, and associated sample sizes and SDs and/or SEs. the primary requirements for selection were amended to include a requirement for 14-d postchallenge data collection. the derived effect sizes were combined by using a random-effects model. the variability estimate incorporated both within-study variance as well as between-studies variance. heterogeneity was considered to be moderate to high, necessitating a random-effects approach. data from 10 of the 29 studies were included in the analysis (9 studies in pigs, 1 study in turkeys) the same set of outcome measures from each publication was used to collect data. no day 14 postchallenge data were collected Arthington et al., 2002 (37) Cows Coronavirus Gaines et al., 2003 (32) Pigs LPS Carroll et al., 2003 (38) Pigs LPS Dritz et al., 1996

for Q provides evidence that the true effects vary. however, Borenstein et al. (27) suggested that a nonsignificant P value cannot be taken as evidence that the effect sizes are consistent. the test for Q is to assess the viability of the null hypothesis rather than to provide an estimate of the magnitude of the true variance. a clear pattern observed in all 3 plots indicates that there does not seem to be any missing studies in any of these cases. these plots suggest that there is considerable heterogeneity, shown by the points outside the lines, but there is nothing to suggest that there are missing studies. Table 2 provides a summary breakdown of all the studies considered and reasons for rejecting studies for inclusion in this meta-analysis. study sizes varied between 4 and 24, with only 2 of the 11 studies considered having a sample size 10.

Q is the weighted sum of squares on a standardized scale. it can be compared with the expected weighted sum of squares to yield an estimate of the null and excess variance. however, a nonsignificant P value obtained for Q provides evidence that the true effects vary. the 2 commonly used tests for publication bias are the Begg-Mazumdar test of Kendall\u2019s rank correlation coefficient (b; a nonparametric test) and the Egger test for publication bias (a parametric test) (27). this test used rank correlation coefficient rather than the ordinary product moment correlation. Agricultural PPI products are prepared primarily from the blood of cattle or pigs. plasma proteins are exposed to high temperatures for a very short period of time. benefits of feeding PPIs have been attributed largely to the immunoglobulin content. pigs fed a diet containing soy protein or PPIs had improvements in body weight and protein mass with no difference in fat mass. the rate of weight gain and protein conversion efficiency was significantly higher in the PPI group, especially during early weaning. improvements in weight gain and feed intake in piglets were found to be consistently greater with PPIs than with feeding comparable amounts of other high-quality protein sources. the findings of our meta-analysis are consistent with results reported from studies of PPIs in healthy weanling animals. coli had lower diarrhea scores (P 0.05) and increased survival (P 0.05) compared with pigs fed a control diet. they did not show significant improvements in ADG, ADFI, or G:F by day 7 postinfection. in lamina propria, SEB increased the cytotoxic lymphocyte populations of -T cells by 38%, NK cells by 59%, and the number of activated T lymphocytes by 148%. both PPIs and ICs significantly decreased the effects of SEB on these lymphocyte subsets. the administration of PPIs significantly reduced d-Glc transport and expression of d-Glc transporters in intestinal brush border membrane vesicles. dietary spray-dried PPIs increased d-Glc transport by 10% compared with the SEB group. 10 d led to stool cultures that were negative for enteropathogenic E. coli in >80% of cases. anti-rotavirus antibodies from milk or plasma protein given orally were effective in maintaining intestinal health and protecting against rotavirus infection. intestinal FA protein (I-FABP), initially increased in 7 of 8 subjects after 8 wk (P = 0.039), but then fell below baseline in 4 of 5 subjects who continued taking SBI for 40 additional weeks (P = 0.12), suggesting inflammation-based destruction of enterocytes had been ameliorated. findings support the hypothesis that oral SBI can play a role in helping to restore intestinal immune balance. the effects observed in the 9 pig studies and the 1 study involving turkeys were consistently positive and support the inference that PPIs may produce similar beneficial effects in humans. the effects observed in the 9 pig studies and the 1 study involving turkeys were consistently positive and support the inference that PPIs may produce similar beneficial effects. studies with PPIs have shown consistently positive effects across multiple species on growth, food intake, and nutritional status in animal populations with inflammation. studies support a role for PPI preparations in maintaining intestinal immune balance, supporting gut barrier function, and improving nutrient absorption."}
