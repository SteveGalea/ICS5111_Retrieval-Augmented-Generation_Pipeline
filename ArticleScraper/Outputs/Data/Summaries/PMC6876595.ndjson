{"summary": "prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affecting children and adolescents has increased dramatically in recent years. this increase is most likely related to the obesity pandemic and the high consumption of fructose. but hepatic steatosis has some rare causes (e.g., some metabolic diseases) of which clinicians should be aware. fatty liver is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in children and adults. fatty liver is already the most common cause of chronic liver disease in children and adolescents. fatty lifestyles leading to obesity and a high-fructose diet may be the causes. hepatic phosphorylase kinase (PhK) subtypes are identified according to the affected subunit (GSD-IXa, GSD-IXb, GSD-IXc, and GSD-IXd) patients with PHKG2 mutations (GSD-IXc) have been reported to have the most severe phenotypes. hepatosplenomegaly was hospitalised for bacterial pneumonia. he had elevated transaminases (AST): 67 IU/L; alanine aminotransferase [ALT]: 53 IU/L. he was admitted to our outpatient clinic when he was 25 months old. sis in ultrasound with no adenomas; and the spleen is in the upper limit of normal size. his mother has normal ALT and has not undergone liver ultrasound or molecular study. mg/dL 10 45 35 3\u201356 Triglycerides, mg/dL 50 227 174 40\u2013160 Other exams performed after Hepatitis A, B, and C negative negative negative CMV IgG+ IgM\u2013 IgG\u2013 IgM\u2013 EBV IgG+ IgM\u2013 EBV IgG+ IgM\u2013 EBV IgG+ IgM\u2013 EBV IgG+ IgM\u2013 EBV IgG+ IgM\u2013 case 2 A male infant, the second child of a healthy non-related couple, was born after a 37-week pregnancy with a weight of 2,750 g (p10\u201350) he developed jaundice that resolved within a week without phototherapy. at 11 months of age, during a wheezing episode, his transaminases (AST 158 IU/L; ALT 155 IU/L) and triglycerides (180 mg/dL) were a male infant was born after a 39-week high-risk pregnancy due to placental displacement. in the first week, he developed jaundice (total bilirubin 17.3 mg/dl) that was treated with phototherapy. he had multiple infections: urinary tract infection caused by Escherichia coli, acute gastroenteritis, fever of undetermined origin, septicaemia caused by Neisseria meningitidis, upper respiratory infection caused by hepatosplenomegaly was born after a 40-week pregnancy with a weight of 3,080 g (p10\u201350) and a length of 48.5 cm (p10) at 18 months of age, he was hospitalised for bacterial pneumonia. he was hospitalised for bacterial pneumonia and had elevated transaminases. liver histology revealed macro- and micro-steatosis without inflammatory infiltrates or fibrosis. c.1054C>T (p. 352X) exon 11 in hemizygosity on the PHKA2 gene. dietary measures were prescribed. mmol/L 17.5 17.9 15.4 22.0\u201329.0 Lactate, mmol/L 1.2 1.28 1.63 0.5\u20132.20 Uric acid, mg/dL 4.7 3.4 4.0 2.0\u20135.5 Total cholesterol, mg/dL 174 174 196 0\u2013200 LDL cholesterol, mg/dL 94 116 136 0\u2013130 HDL cholesterol, mg/dL 70 13 25 35\u201355 VLDL cholesterol, mg/dL 10 45 exon 7 in hemizygosity BMI, body mass index; CMV, cytomegalovirus; EBV, Epstein-Barr virus; lysosomal acid lipase; NA, non-available; ND, not done. case 1 showed macro- and micro-steatosis; hepatocytes with preserved morphology, and dimensions within normal ranges, without inflammatory infiltrate or fibrosis. hepatomegaly remained the same, although transaminases normalised. he has no signs of progression to chronic liver disease or adenomas. his older sister (16 years old) is asymptomatic, with normal ALT and liver ultrasound. at 18 months, abdominal ultrasound showed an enlarged liver with a pattern suggestive of steatosis and a normal-sized spleen. one year later, molecular study confirmed the new and unrecognized mutation c.706G>T (p. E236*) exon 7 in hemizygosity in the PhKA2 gene. ALT is currently the best screening method for fatty liver in children aged 10 years. sensitivity is 88% and 26% specificity for values >2 times the normal value. MRI-estimated proton density fat fraction is currently the most accurate test to quantify liver steatosis. the guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of NAFLD (2017) do not provide enough orientation to a cost-benefit approach regarding who should be screened. in this case series, we prioritised the exclusion of diseases with specific treatment and considered the patient's age. in patient 2, the hypothesis of drug hepatotoxicity by montelukast was considered. phenotypes in PHKA2 have broad phenotypic spectrum, including progression to cirrhosis [9, 10] and the development of hepatic adenomas [11] and less common phenotypes with kidney dysfunctions due to renal tubular acidosis. the treatment includes dietary measures, namely, a high-protein diet (2\u20133 g/kg) with restriction of simple (added) sugars, avoidance of prolonged fasting, liver involvement can range in a spectrum from steatosis to steatohepatitis, with or without variable degrees of fibrosis/progression to liver cirrhosis. the development of a next-generation sequencing panel can be a useful tool in the management of these patients [24]"}
