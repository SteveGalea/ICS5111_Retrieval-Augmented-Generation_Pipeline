{"summary": "a panel of VSAPAM-specific antibodies (3) can opsonize VSAPAM-expressing IEs for phagocytosis and interfere with CSA-specific adhesion of IEs. the antibodies can be used to enrich for VSAPAM expression in parasites not expressing VSAPAM but obtained from women with PAM (3). one antibody (PAM14) was chosen because it appears to react with most or all parasites expressing VSAPAM. the other antibody (PAM81) was chosen because it reacts with a well-defined, but inter-clonally variant epitope in the DBL3X domain of VAR2CSA. the 3D7 clone was originally derived from NF54 parasites isolated from a Dutch girl near Amsterdam airport. HB3 was chosen because it can be selected for expression of VSAPAM that react with PAM14 but not PAM81 (3). plasma from 30 women (10 pregnant for the first time, 10 for the third time, and 10 for the fifth time) to assess parity-dependency. parasite isolates were only considered to express VSAPAM if plasma IgG recognition of IEs was both sex-specific and parity-dependent. monoclonal antibodies We used eight VSAPAM-specific monoclonal IgG1 antibodies. VSAPAM is defined here as IE surface-expressed VSA. the recognition by plasma IgG from these men is not significantly different. the 3D7 clone was originally derived from NF54 parasites isolated from a Dutch girl near Amsterdam airport (5). it was chosen because it can be selected for expression of VSAPAM that react with PAM14 but not PAM81 (3). term plasma from 30 women (10 pregnant for the first time, 10 for the third time, and 10 for the fifth time) to assess parity-dependency. parasite isolates were only considered to express VSAPAM if plasma IgG recognition of IEs was both sex-specific and parity-dependent. 005) overall differences were detected, significant pair-wise differences were isolated by Holm-Sidak's or Dunn's test for normal- and non-normal-distributed data. RESULTS Human monoclonal IgG can select Plasmodium falciparum-IEs for expression of VSAPAM. IE surface-reactive levels did not depend on parity. PAM14-selected 3D7, PAM14- and PAM81-selected HB3 acquired a typical sex-specific and parity dependent VSAPAM expression pattern after four additional rounds of selection. 3D7 selected seven times for reactivity with PAM81 retained an indeterminate sex-specificity pattern also seen after three rounds of selection. however, 3D7 selected seven times for reactivity with PAM81 retained an indeterminate sex-specificity IE surface-reactive IgG levels in at least one of the three donor categories differ from at least one other category. only if this is the case, can sex-specificity be confidently assessed by post hoc testing for significant (P 005) pair-wise differences. negative cut-off, defined as the upper level of recognition of unselected parasites, is indicated as a dashed horizontal line. var2csa transcripts among all var transcripts in 3D7 (g) and HB3 (h) before selection. transcript levels of the var2csa-B gene increased from 23% to 57% and 92% after seven rounds of selection by PAM14 and PAM81. no var transcript other than var2csa-B showed marked changes. var2csa was therefore the dominant transcript in all the parasites following antibody selection. the recognition of 3D7- and HB3-IEs on either PAM14 or PAM81 showed an indeterminate VSA phenotype. PAM81-selected 3D7 remained nonreactive with the four monoclonal antibodies used for testing at this time. the other three parasite lines showed reactivity with at least one of them. PAM81 could not be used to select 3D7 for VSAPAM reactivity. this is consistent with the absence of the predicted epitope for this antibody in the VAR2CSA DBL3-X domain of this parasite. no of the criteria for sex-specificity were met. results in panels A-C are presented as medians (horizontal line), central 50% of data points (boxes), central 80% of data points and outliers (\u2022) var2csa transcripts constituted 7% of total measured var gene transcripts in unselected 3D7 parasites. the HB3 genome contains two var2csa paralogs, var2csa-A and var2csa-B (13). var2csa-A transcripts constituted 1% of the measured var transcripts. var2csa-A : var2csa-B transcripts may therefore reflect a founder effect. DISCUSSION The VSA subset VSAPAM is expressed by P. falciparum involved in pregnancy-associated malaria (PAM) switching to VSAPAM expression requires signals from the pregnant host. it has been argued that selection of parasites by panning on CSA in vitro may result in expression of antigens of dubious relevance to the antigens expressed as a result of in vivo selection. our study corroborates existing evidence that PAM14 recognizes most if not all VSAPAM-expressing parasites by recognizing a functionally constrained and conformation-dependent discontinuous epitope in VAR2CSA (3). however, the PAM14 epitope is a highly attractive candidate for development of a PAM-specific vaccine."}
