{"summary": "zinc deficiency rates in developing countries range from 20 to 30%. some of the predominant zinc-dependent functions such as immune response, metabolism, nucleic acid synthesis and repair, apoptosis and redox homeostasis act as important determinants of host-pathogen interactions. zinc-specific chelator mimics acute zinc-deficiency in cell culture models of infection. zinc chelation showed an inhibitory effect on DENV and JEV replication but had no effect on RV infection. zinc chelation leads to induction of ER stress and heat shock proteins, activation of NF-B leading to upregulation of type I interferon-dependent antiviral response. our study provides information on the role of zinc in flavivirus infection. it shows that alteration of zinc homeostasis leads to induction of an antiviral response involving ER stress and NF-B that specifically affects flaviviruses. 0.5 M TPEN was added in serum-free media after infection. supernatant was collected for estimating virus titer by plaque assay. cells were collected for western blotting or quantitative real-time PCR. cells were detached using trypsin (80\u2013120 L) (Gibco) and collected by adding defined trypsin inhibitor (Gibco) cells were stained using either 5 M Fluozin-3-AM (Molecular Probes) or 2.5 M ZinPyr-1 (ZP-1) (Santa Cruz) in the staining media. supernatant was collected for estimating viral titres by plaque assay. cells were harvested for positive and negative strand detection PCR. RNA was isolated using RNAiso Plus (Takara) as per manufacturer's instructions and reverse transcribed using forward or reverse primer. cells were incubated with antibodies against -catenin (Sigma) and occludin (Invitrogen) in IMF buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 0.02 % sodium azide) for 1 h at RT followed by washing and incubation with Alexa flour 568 tagged secondary antibodies (Molecular probes) for 30 min at Cytotoxicity and Cell Proliferation Assays Cytotoxicity was assessed by CytoTox 96 Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay kit (Promega) as a positive control for cytotoxicity, cells were lysed in 0.1% Triton-X-100. the amount of LDH activity in the detergent-treated sample was considered as 100%. cells were collected in 300 l RNA lysis buffer (RNA prep kit-Zymo-R1051) RNA was prepared according to manufacturer's instructions and eluted in 20 l nuclease-free water. mRNA was purified using oligo-dT beads (TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit, Illumina) mRNA was purified at 90\u00b0C in the presence of divalent cations. Adapter-ligated fragments are then amplified and gel purified. each fragment is then amplified into distinct, clonal clusters. dNTPs are present during each sequencing cycle. ly significant Student's t-test P value threshold adjusted for false discovery rate of 0.001. enriched functional classes with a P value adjusted for false discovery rate of 0.001 were determined using cluster 3.0 for normalizing and hierarchical clustering.

RNA was isolated using RNAiso Plus (Takara) as per manufacturer's instructions. RT product was amplified using RNAiso Plus (Takara) as per manufacturer's instructions. alternate day and trans-electrical epithelial resistance (TEER) was monitored using a chopstick electrode. cells were washed with cold PBS and fixed in ice-cold methanol for 20 min at 20\u00b0C. cells were incubated with antibodies against -catenin (Sigma) and occludin (Invitrogen) in IMF buffer. TEER was monitored till 72 h pi for DENV infection and 16 h pi for RV infection. effects of zinc in rescuing RV induced barrier damage was assessed by adding 50 M ZnSO4 in the media of infected cells. cells were washed twice with PBS and serum-free DMEM containing DMSO and TPEN (0.5 M) were added to respective wells and cultured for 4 h. RNA was prepared according to manufacturer's instructions and eluted in 20 l nuclease-free water. the individual libraries were quantified using a nanodrop spectrophotometer. Adapter-ligated fragments are then PCR amplified and gel purified. each fragment is then amplified into distinct, clonal clusters. differentially expressed transcripts between Control and Treated samples were identified using a fold-change threshold of absolute fold-change 1.5. a statistically significant Student's t-test P value threshold adjusted for false discovery rate of 0.001 was determined using Student's t-test with Benjamini Hocheberg FDR test. the heat map for display expression pattern was obtained using Cluster 3.0 for normalizing and hierarchical clustering. positive and negative z-score suggests the activation and inhibition of the pathway, respectively. different shades of red and green nodes reflect the relative fold change of gene transcripts. each line is has at least one reference from the literature. second strand cDNA was synthesized using random hexamers and Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase. the cDNAs so obtained were cleaned using Beckman Coulter Agencourt Ampure XP SPRI beads. the sequencing library is prepared by random fragmentation of the cDNA sample, followed by 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 adapter ligation. RNA Seq Data Analysis Stringent quality control of Paired End sequence reads of all samples was done using NGSQCTool kit (22) unsupervised hierarchical clustering of differentially expressed genes was done using Cluster 3.0 (25) and visualized using Java Tree View (26). differentially regulated genes are known as focus genes in IPA. a p-value was calculated using right-tailed Fisher's exact test. IPA automatically calculates the z-score in the range of 2 z >2. two epithelial cell lines Caco-2 (colon) and A549 (lung) showed a 3-fold increase in labile zinc levels. labile zinc levels were unchanged in both the cells by flow cytometry. zinc supplementation had no effect in Caco-2 when added only in the apical or basolateral medium. but when both apical and basolateral medium was supplemented with Zn, TEER values decreased significantly. we then measured labile Zn levels using fluozin-3AM. dengue Virus and Rotavirus Differentially Affect Permeability Barrier Functions Gastrointestinal bleeding is a hallmark of severe dengue disease. there have been no investigations to assess the direct effect of dengue infection on gut barrier functions. we measured cell viability in rotavirus infection at 16 h pi by live-dead staining using flow cytometry. we did not find any difference between mock and RV infection suggesting factors other than cytotoxicity are responsible for disruption in the TEER. representative RV titres determined by plaque assay and represented as pfu/ml at 16 h pi. viability of Caco-2 cells infected with RV as compared to mock measured by live dead staining using flow cytometry (F) TEER at 16 h pi of Caco-2 cells grown in transwells. PEN found 20 and 40% reduction in mean fluorescence intensity of ZP-1. cells were cultured in serum-free medium containing DMSO. titers were measured by plaque assay at 24 h pi or 16 h pi. 10 M of ZnSO4/MnCl2/MgCl2/CuCl2/FeSO4 and viral titers in the supernatant was measured by plaque assay at 24 h pi. the results confirm that the inhibitory effect of TPEN is specifically due to zinc chelation. we added TPEN at 8, 16, and 24 h pi and viral titers were measured after 16 h treatment at each time point. the reduction in viral titers was more drastic at early stages of viral infection. negative strand RNA was measured by qRT-PCR. labile zinc levels recovered to about 90% of DMSO controls within 2 h of replacing the medium. titers in the supernatant were measured by plaque assays at 24 h pi. a significant reduction in DENV titers in both the cell lines and DENV RNA levels were also reduced upon TPEN pre-treatment in Caco-2 cells. this effect was not due to defect in cellular entry of the virus. a transient and reversible zinc chelation was sufficient to perturb DENV replication. a transient and reversible zinc chelation was sufficient to perturb DENV replication. this suggests that chelating free zinc may modulate cellular pathways that negatively affect DENV replication. zinc chelation induces antiviral response due to ER stress and NF-B Activation RNA seq analysis suggested zinc chelation may activate ER stress response and NF-B and its downstream targets which may block dengue virus replication. we next tested if blocking unfolded protein response would rescue the inhibitory effect of zinc chelation. IFIT5 showed maximum induction as compared to IFIT2 and IFIT3 (Figures 7F\u2013H). Interestingly, IFIT5 was one of the genes upregulated upon TPEN treatment in the RNA seq data. two epithelial cell lines Caco-2 (colon) and A549 (lung) showed a 3-fold increase in labile zinc levels. caco-2 cells showed a 3-fold increase in labile zinc levels. zinc supplementation had no effect in Caco-2 when added only in the apical or basolateral medium. however, when both apical and basolateral medium was supplemented with Zn, TEER values decreased significantly. we then measured labile Zn levels using fluozin-3AM. apical, basolateral, and apical + basolateral regions in 2% DMEM for 24 h. percentage of dead cells in apical, basolateral, and apical + basolateral cells measured by live dead stain. rotavirus (RV) has been shown to infect Caco-2 cells and disrupt barrier functions. results suggest that dengue virus does not directly disrupt epithelial barrier functions and is capable of exiting cells from the basolateral membranes. deNV infected Caco-2 cells compared to mock measured till 72 h pi. TEER of RV infected Caco-2 cells represented as pfu/ml at 16 h pi. titers in the supernatant were measured by plaque assay at 24 h pi (for DENV and JEV) and 16 h pi (for RV). zinc chelation by TPEN has a drastic negative effect on flaviviruses, DENV and JEV. the culture medium was supplemented with 10 M of ZnSO4/MnCl2/MgCl2/CuCl2/FeSO4 and viral titers in the supernatant was measured by plaque assay at 24 h pi. only ZnSO4 blocked the inhibitory effect of zinc chelation. ns, not significant. Zinc Chelation affects DENV RNA Replication. we added TPEN at 8, 16, and 24 h pi and viral titers were measured after 16 h treatment. the reduction in viral titers was more drastic at early stages of viral infection. serum-free medium and cells were collected at 24 h pi for estimation of (D) positive and (E) negative strand RNA by qRT-PCR. labile zinc levels recovered to about 90% of DMSO controls within 2 h of replacing the medium. titers in the supernatant were measured by plaque assays at 24 h pi. a significant reduction in DENV titers in both the cell lines and DENV RNA levels were also reduced upon TPEN pre-treatment in Caco-2 cells. this effect was not due to defect in cellular entry of the virus. iters in the supernatant was measured by plaque assay. all the data are from at least two independent experiments with triplicate samples. a transient and reversible zinc chelation was sufficient to perturb DENV replication. zinc chelation induces antiviral response due to ER stress and NF-B Activation. RNA seq analysis suggested zinc chelation may activate ER stress response and NF-B and its downstream targets. we then tested if blocking unfolded protein response would rescue the inhibitory effect of zinc chelation. peptide repeats 2, 3, and 5 (IFIT2, IFIT3, and IFIT5) showed maximum induction compared to IFIT2 and IFIT3 (Figures 7F\u2013H). Interestingly, IFIT5 was one of the genes upregulated upon TPEN treatment in the RNA seq data. zinc supplementation trials have shown that oral zinc is beneficial in children over 6 months of age in regions where zinc deficiency is prevalent. zinc supplementation post-infection had no effect on viral titres or barrier disruption in rotavirus-infected cells. zinc supplementation post-infection had no effect on viral titres or barrier disruption in rotavirus-infected cells. zinc salts were shown to inhibit viral protease activity (46, 47) zinc chelation also affected the RdRp activity of influenza viruses and the 2A proteinase of human rhinovirus. zinc depletion by TPEN inhibited DENV and JEV infection but not RV infection. zinc homeostasis may regulate few viruses depending on the requirement of cellular zinc for completion of virus life-cycle. transient zinc chelation led to induction of an antiviral state in cells via induction of heat shock proteins and activation of NF-B and upregulation of downstream effectors which inhibit DENV replication. PEN was shown to improve survival of mice infected with aspergillus fumigatus (59) zinc chelation by TPEN was shown to inhibit APOBEC3 degradation by HIV-1Vif and made the virus susceptible to the antiviral activity of APOBEC3 (60) this studies suggest that zinc chelation can be an attractive antimicrobial option. click here for additional data file.
