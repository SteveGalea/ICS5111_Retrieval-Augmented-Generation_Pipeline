{"summary": "introduction FIV can induce immunosuppression, which predisposes cats to secondary infections, stomatitis, neuropathies, and tumors. the most important strategy for managing FIV-infected cats is treatment of secondary infections. in cats with no identifiable secondary diseases, additional treatment with antiviral drugs can be considered. retroviral enzyme integrase (integrase inhibitors); drugs that inhibit viral replication by inhibiting the retroviral enzyme protease (protease inhibitors); and interferons. a nucleoside consists of a nitrogenous base covalently attached to a sugar (ribose in RNA, 2-deoxyribose in DNA), and a nucleotide consists of a nitrogenous base, a sugar, and a nucleic acid (RNA and DNA) contains a chain of nucleotides covalently linked to form a sugar-phosphate backbone with protruding nitrogenous bases. three phosphate groups must be bound to the nucleoside (triphosphate), two of which are removed, releasing energy during elongation of the nucleic acid chain. many of these molecules are also integrated into growing DNA or RNA strands. zidovudine inhibited FIV replication in Crandell-Rees feline kidney (CRFK) cells. the susceptibility of FIV to zidovudine was similar to that of HIV. in vivo, zidovudine can reduce plasma viral load, improve the immunologic and clinical status of FIV-infected cats. Stavudine Stavudine (2\u2032,3\u2032-didehydro-2\u2032,3\u2032-dideoxythymidine, d4T) is another drug effective against HIV. it was approved for treatment of HIV infection in 1994, but in recent years has been replaced in most multi-drug treatment protocols by compounds with fewer side effects. resistance is caused by a single-point mutation in the RT-encoding region of the pol gene. a combination of zidovudine and lamivudine had synergistic anti-FIV activities in cell cultures. ivudine/lamivudine treatment showed no anti-FIV activity in chronically infected cats. in vitro, antiviral efficacy has been demonstrated against FIV. abacavir is active against FIV in vitro, but had higher levels of cytotoxicity than other compounds, such as didanosine and amdoxovir [16,20]. there are no in vivo studies of this drug in FIV-infected cats. zidovudine is the first drug approved for treatment of HIV infection. cats with bone marrow suppression should not be treated with zidovudine. the hematocrit can decline within three weeks of initiating treatment. other side effects in cats, including vomiting or anorexia, are rare. didanosine is an anti-HIV drug approved in 1995. a combination of zidovudine and lamivudine had synergistic anti-FIV activities in cell cultures. a combination of zidovudine and lamivudine protected cats from infection. abine (2',3'-deoxy-5-fluoro-3'-thiacytidine, FTC) is structurally similar to lamivudine. in vitro, antiviral efficacy has been demonstrated against FIV. there have been no in vivo studies of this drug in FIV-infected cats. adefovir belongs to the acyclic nucleoside phosphonates. the alkyl side chain of purines and pyrimidines is linked to a modified phosphate moiety. this phosphonate bond is not hydrolysable, which makes it more difficult to cleave off these compounds once they have been incorporated. the only approved NtARTi for the treatment of HIV infection is tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), the prodrug of tenofovir (R)-9-(2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)adenine, (R)-PMPA. the antiviral spectrum of tenofovir (R-1-(6-amino-9H-purin-9-yl)-propan-2-yl-oxy-methyl- adefovir belongs to the acyclic nucleoside phosphonates, in which the alkyl side chain of purines and pyrimidines is linked to a modified phosphate moiety and a C-P phosphonate linkage replaces the normal O5\u2032-P phosphate linkage. this phosphonate bond is not hydrolysable, making it more difficult to cleave off these compounds once they have been incorporated at the 3\u2032 tenofovir is a member of the acyclic nucleoside phosphonates. the antiviral spectrum of tenofovir is narrower than that of adefovir. it does not encompass herpesviruses, but is confined to hepadna- and retroviruses. three of the FDA-approved NNRTIs (nevirapine, delavirdine, efavirenz) have been shown not to be effective against FIV in vitro. only one old NNRTI, suramin, with a broad antiviral spectrum has been used in veterinary medicine. Suramin is associated with a significant number of severe side effects in humans. nausea and anaphylactic shock as immediate reactions during administration and peripheral neuritis leading to palmar-plantar hyperesthesia. photophobia, skin reactions, agranulocytosis, hemolytic anemia, and destruction of the adrenal cortex as later side effects. phosphonoformic acid, PFA, has broad-spectrum antiviral activity against DNA and RNA viruses, including retroviruses. it is FDA-approved for the treatment of HIV-associated cytomegalo and herpes simplex virus infections in humans. in vitro, foscarnet has been shown to be active against FIV, but foscarnet-resistant FIV strains can develop. ribavirin has marked in vitro antiviral activity against a variety of DNA and RNA viruses. there is a dose-related toxic effect on bone marrow. it is FDA-approved for the treatment of HIV-associated cytomegalo and herpes simplex virus infections in humans and cats. it has many side effects, including nephrotoxicity and myelosuppression, in both humans and cats. it also is toxic to epithelial cells and mucous membranes. ribavirin is active against many viruses in vitro, including FIV. the efficacy of ribavirin has not been investigated in infected cats. bicyclams act as potent and selective chemokine receptor 4 antagonists. hydrate, AMD3100 is the bicyclam prototype compound. it is not marketed as an anti-HIV drug, but is used in humans for stem cell mobilization. development of resistance of FIV isolates to plerixafor did not occur during treatment. Protease inhibitors (PI) specifically bind to the active site of the protease. side effects and development of viral resistance were found during treatment. no studies in FIV-infected cats exist so far. atazanavir Atazanavir (methyl N-[(2R)-1-[2-[(2S,3S)-2-hydroxy-3-[[(2R)-2-(methoxycarbonylamino)-3,3-di-methylbutanoyl]amino]-4-(2,3,4,5,6-pentadeuteriophenyl)butyl]-2-[(4-pyridin-2-ylphenyl)methyl atazanavir Atazanavir is an anti-HIV compound approved in 2001. it was shown to be active against FIV in vitro but did not prevent FIV replication completely. there are no in vivo studies in FIV-infected cats. the drug was shown to be active against FIV in vitro [92] but FIV was less susceptible to raltegravir than HIV [92]. no studies in FIV-infected cats exist so far. retroviral protein synthesis is not affected by IFNs. interferons trigger virus-infected cells to undergo apoptosis by activating gene expression for apoptosis. human IFNs have been manufactured by recombinant DNA technology. cytokines by lymphatic cells in the oropharyngeal area triggers a cascade of immunologic responses with systemic effects. controlled studies evaluating the effect of parenteral administration of rHuIFN- in FIV-infected cats have not been conducted. clinical improvement was observed after parenteral rFeIFN- (106 U/kg SC q 24 h on FIVe consecutive days for three cycles), but this study lacked a placebo control. the treatment protocol was 105 U/cat PO q 24 h for 90 consecutive days, administered by the cats\u2019 owners. human interferon-recombinant human interferon- (rHuIFN-) has antiviral and immune-modulatory activity. human IFN- becomes ineffective after three to seven weeks of parenteral use in cats. use of oral rHuIFN- in 24 ill, naturally FIV-infected cats resulted in improvement of clinical signs (e.g., fever, lymphadenopathy, opportunistic infections) in a placebo-controlled study. it is impossible to conclude whether treatment with rHuIFN- had indeed an effect on FIV, or rather on secondary infections. a recent study evaluated the use of oral administration of rFeIFN- for the treatment of 11 client-owned, naturally FIV-infected cats with clinical signs. the treatment protocol was 105 U/cat PO q 24 h for 90 consecutive days, administered by the cats\u2019 owners. a historical retrospective group was used as a control for comparison. rFeIFN- has an effect on secondary infections rather than on FIV itself. a definitive conclusion cannot be drawn without additional randomized, placebo-controlled, and double-blinded studies."}
