{"summary": "more than half of approved drugs from 1981 to 2010 were based on NPs. microbes are the most prolific source of bioactive metabolites with a rate of 44%\u201346% compared with the overall rate of 20%\u201325% for all NPs sources. the current success rate of discovery from the marine world is 1.7- to 3.3-fold better than the industry average. there are facilities for high-throughput screening available both in academic labs as well as in drug pharmaceutical companies. this is a field that can be significantly improved by the modeling of data from large databases containing information relatively to biological activities. quantum-chemical descriptors, e.g., net atomic charges, HOMO and LUMO energies, hardness, chemical potential, electrophilicity index, have been shown to be useful in the estimation of various biological activities. the usefulness of these descriptors was also demonstrated by the estimation and study of antioxidant, antitumor or antibacterial activities. active and non-active compounds from the PubChem database were compared to predict the two classes (i.e., active and non-active compounds) for each task three models were built using: 232 CDK descriptors, eight semi-empirical quantum-chemical descriptors calculated by the PM6 method. a further test set (AntiMarin set) extracted from the AntiMarin database was used but not with main purpose of external model validation.

FPs with high probability of being antibiotic (Probantibiotic) may be lead-like antibiotic MNP and MbNP, which have been misclassified as non-antibiotic compounds in the AntiMarin scheme 4 illustrates the 15 FPs with a Probantibiotic greater than or equal to 0.68 in the CDK Rf overall biological activity model [15]. a penicillin analog was also classified as FP, ID 493 in Scheme 4. unreported 15 lead antibiotic MNPs and MbNPs from antiMarin database. three large macrocyclic lactone and lactam ring derivatives were also classified as being antibiotic. the lack of reported antibiotic activity for these derivatives is well known. the CPSA, BCUT and WHIM descriptors are weighted holistic invariant molecular descriptors that are built in such a way to capture relevant molecular 3D information. only the MDEO-12 (molecular distance edge between primary and secondary oxygen atoms) and the khs.sssCH (a fragment count descriptor that encode the presence of a tertiary carbon group in which it has three single bonds) descriptors the first rule of the antitumor tree was applied to discriminate antitumor/non-antitumor 722/500 compounds. the results were even impressive when only the \u201cMDEO-12 0.999\u201d rule was applied. the results were even impressive when only the \u201cMDEO-12 0.999\u201d rule was applied. the topoPSA descriptor presents similar results for both antibiotic and non-antibiotic classes differently to the antitumor CT model. globally 1353 out of 1746 compounds, 77%, were correctly classified by this rule with 499 out of 642 antibiotic compounds, 78%, and 854 out of 1104 non-antibiotic compounds, 77%, correctly classified. test set I consists of 1318 antitumor, 968 antibiotic, 55 antifungal, 11 antimalarial, one anti-HIV, 74 anti-microbial, 145 cytotoxic and 199 non-active compounds. the non-active compounds were selected on the basis that they were screened for at least one biological activity. 270 empirical molecular descriptors, including electronic, topological, geometrical, constitutional, and hybrid (BCUT and WHIM) descriptors were calculated using the CDK Descriptor Calculator 1.3.2 [52,53] the calculation of the semi-empirical quantum chemical descriptors was performed in a semi-automatic way. the selection of the best set of descriptors to model each activity consists in the application of the Correlation-based Feature Subset Selection algorithm [60]. ML Techniques The KNN algorithm [61] predicts the activity for a compound by majority voting of the k most similar compounds in the training set. the prediction for a compound reaching a given terminal node is obtained by a majority vote of the objects (in the training set) a Rf [64] is an ensemble of unpruned classification trees created by using bootstrap samples of the training data set. the best split at each node was defined among a randomly selected subset of descriptors. 232 CDK descriptors and 8 PM6 descriptors were used. the 232 CDK descriptors and the other using both the 232 CDK descriptors and the 8 PM6 descriptors. the training set and test set I consists of 1318 antitumor, 968 antibiotic, 55 antifungal, 11 antimalarial, one anti-HIV, 145 cytotoxic and 199 non-active compounds. of note some compounds have more than one bioactivity record. tool version 5.12.3 (ChemAxon Ltd., Budapest, Hungary) were used to standardize the molecular structures by normalization of tautomeric groups and by removing small fragments. 270 empirical molecular descriptors, including electronic, topological, geometrical, constitutional, and hybrid (BCUT and WHIM) descriptors were calculated using the CDK Descriptor Calculator 1.3.2 [52,53] selection of descriptors and optimization of QSAR classification methods. first step for selection of best set of descriptors was removal of constant descriptors (i.e., a descriptor that presents the same value for all compounds of a data set, this usually being zero) a classification tree is sequentially constructed by partitioning compounds into two child nodes. each node is produced by a logical rule defined for a single descriptor. the prediction for a compound reaching a given terminal node is obtained by a majority vote of the objects reaching the same terminal node. the Rf models were built with 500 trees and by three approaches. one using 232 CDK descriptors, the other using 8 semi-empirical quantum-chemical descriptors and the other using both the 232 CDK descriptors and the 8 PM6 descriptors. results suggest that the implemented computer-aided approach could be used to predict the bioactivity of new, or existing NPs without bioactivity. the HOMO quantum-chemical descriptor in the discrimination in large scale data sets of lead-like or drug-like compounds has never been reported. the discrimination in large sets of bioactive molecules could be an interesting approach in future works."}
