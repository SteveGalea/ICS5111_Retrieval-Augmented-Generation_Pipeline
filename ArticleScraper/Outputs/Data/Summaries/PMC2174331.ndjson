{"summary": "the ER quality control mechanism assures that functionally incompetent, misfolded, or unassembled oligomeric proteins are retained and targeted for proteolysis via the ERAD pathway. the ATP-dependent cleavage process is facilitated by multiple ubiquitin attachments to the -amino groups of lysine residues of the substrate. CFTR is a cAMP-stimulated Cl channel, residing predominantly at the cell surface. the channel consists of two homologous halves, each comprised of six transmembrane helices and a nucleotide binding domain. this complex multidomain structure renders the posttranslational folding of wild-type (wt) CFTR inefficient. processing of the high mannose type N-linked glycan to complex type oligosaccharides in the cis/medial Golgi region is reflected by a decreased electrophoretic mobility (180 kD) the folded complex-glycosylated CFTR has a slow turnover in vivo (t 1/2 > 12 h), but also displays a conformation which is more resistant to proteolysis in vitro. complex-glycosylated mutants are sixfold shorter than their wt counterpart. lysosomal proteolysis appears to represent the rate-limiting step in the elimination of nonnative CFTR after its escape from the ER quality control. the constructs were sequenced to verify that no errors had been introduced. the cDNA was provided by Dr. J. Bonifacino. immunoblotting performed using mouse monoclonal L12B4 and M3A7 anti-CFTR antibodies. primary Abs were visualized by horseradish peroxidase\u2013conjugated sheep anti\u2013mouse IgG and enhanced chemiluminescence. radioactivity associated with CFTR was visualized by fluorography and quantified by PhosphorImager (PDI) cells were biotinylated in the presence of 1 mg/ml sulphosuccinimidyl-2-(biotinamido)ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate. cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, supplemented with 0.1% BSA, 1 mM MgCl2, and 0.1 mM CaCl2, and solubilized in RIPA buffer. microsomes pelleted by centrifugation from postnuclear supernatant. microsomes were fractionated on self-forming Percoll density gradient. lysosomes were labeled with fluorescein-dextran (0.5 mg/ml, 70 kD; Molecular Probes) the microsomes were digested in HSE medium (10 mM Hepes, 0.25 M sucrose, pH 7.6) in the presence, at the indicated concentration, of trypsin or proteinase K for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. samples were immediately denatured in 2 Laemmli sample buffer at 37\u00b0C for 20 min and probed by immunoblot analysis. the extracellular and transmembrane segment of the interleukin 2 receptor (Tac) was fused to the cytoplasmic tail of Lamp-1. the constructs were sequenced to verify no errors had been introduced. nuclei and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation (15,000 g, 15 min at 4\u00b0C) proteins were denatured in Laemmli sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. immunoblotting was performed as described previously using mouse monoclonal L12B4 and M3A7 anti-CFTR antibodies. cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, supplemented with 0.1% BSA, 1 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM CaCl2, and solubilized in RIPA buffer. biotinylated CFTR was visualized with fluorography and radioactivity was measured by PhosphorImage analysis. lysosomes were labeled with fluorescein-dextran (0.5 mg/ml, 70 kD; Molecular Probes), overnight and chased in full medium for 3 h. the fluorescence associated with the fractions was determined with fluorescence spectrophotometry in the presence of 0.2% Triton X-100. Isolation of ER-, Golgi complex\u2013, and plasma membrane\u2013enriched microsomes was performed as described. microsomes (0.8\u20131.5 mg/ml) were digested in HSE medium (10 mM Hepes, 0.25 M sucrose, pH 7.6) in the presence of trypsin or proteinase K for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. the steady state expression level of the complex-glycosylated CFTR missing its last 70, 82, or 98 amino acids was decreased by 90% compared with wt CFTR in heterologous expression systems. it was also shown that neither the translational rate nor the biosynthetic maturation of the T70 and T82 CFTR was significantly impaired at the ER. biotinylated polypeptides were isolated on Streptavidin-Sepharose. the abundance of biotinylated T70, T82, and T98 CFTR was only 5\u20138% relative to wt or T26 CFTR. the steady state level of the complex-glycosylated pools was also diminished to 5\u201310% relative to that of wt or T26 CFTR. l sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin for 60 min at 37\u00b0C were isolated by immunoprecipitation with L12B4 and M3A7 anti-CFTR Abs. 10% of the immunoprecipitate was directly loaded. the sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin remains membrane impermeant during the labeling, indicated by lack of biotinylated core-glycosylated forms. peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) was separated by SDS-PAGE and probed by the L12B4 anti-CFTR Ab. the cell surface targeting efficiency of newly synthesized CFTR was 74 4% (mean SEM, n = 4). the calculated targeting efficiency of the T70 CFTR represents an underestimate. the plasma membrane delivery of the complex-glycosylated wt and T70 CFTR is largely preserved. biotinylated wt was immunoprecipitated by anti-CFTR Abs. lysosomal protease inhibitors inhibit endolysosomal proteolysis by dissipating the acidic luminal pH and interfering with cargo delivery. leupeptin and pepstatin A, inhibitors of cathepsins B, H, L, N, S, and T, have a negligible effect on the degradation rate (Fig. 2A and Fig. 2 C) the role of lysosomal proteases in the metabolism of truncated and wt CFTR. BHK cells were chased for 2 h to ensure conversion of core-glycosylated form to complex-glycosylated CFTR at 37\u00b0C. complex-glycosylated wt CFTR was determined in stably transfected CHO cells in the presence of NH4Cl (15 mM), chloroquin (200 M), or leupeptin plus pepstatin A (leu+pep; 50 g/ml) as described for A and B. lysosomes expressing wt or T70 CFTR were treated with leupeptin and pepstatin A overnight (50 g/ml) and for 4 h (100 g/ml) microsomes were isolated on Percoll density gradient, and fractions 5\u201313 and 15\u201318. lysosomal proteases are essential for the elimination of the complex-glycosylated full-length wt CFTR. in addition, endolysosomal proteases appear to be involved in the processing of the proteolytic intermediates derived from both T70 and wt CFTR. the 26S proteasome is responsible for the degradation of misfolded polypeptides recognized by the ER quality control. lactacystin and MG132 exerted a less pronounced effect. augmented conversion of the core- to the complex-glycosylated form was not attributable to the lactacystin effect. neither lactacystin nor MG 132 promoted the processing of the core-glycosylated CFTR. the stability of the complex-glycosylated form was monitored by immunoprecipitation and fluorography. the radioactivity remaining in the complex-glycosylated CFTR was measured by PhosphorImage analysis and expressed as the percentage of the amount detected after a 2-h chase (B). lactacystin impedes the degradation of the core-glycosylated T70 CFTR. the degradation of the Tac-Lamp1 chimera is sensitive to the inhibition of the vacuolar H+-ATPase with bafilomycin B (Baf B) lactacystin (Lac; 10 M) and MG132 (10 M) for 3 h were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with the L12B4 anti-CFTR Ab. the cAMP-activated halide conductance of T70 CFTR\u2013expressing BHK cells was measured by the iodide efflux assay. destabilization of the complex-glycosylated truncated CFTR manifests at the distal stage of the secretory pathway. similar stabilization was observed upon retaining the complex-glycosylated CFTR in the distal Golgi region by aluminum fluoride. the specificity of the drugs was examined on BHK cells expressing Tac-TCR or Tac-Lamp1 chimeras. the turnover of biotinylated T70 CFTR is sevenfold shorter (t 1/2 1.9 h) than the wt CFTR (t 1/2 14.5 h); lactacystin and MG132 inhibited the turnover of biotinylated T70 CFTR by 2.6- and 1.9-fold. tin and MG132 suggest proteasome activity is involved in the degradation of polyubiquitinated T70 CFTR. similar results were obtained by monitoring the conjugation of endogenous Ub with a monoclonal anti-Ub Ab. the degradation of core-glycosylated T70 CFTR was ensured during a 2-h chase. an additional 2-h chase was performed in the presence of MG132 (MG; 10 M) or leupeptin and pepstatin A (leu+pep; 50 g/ml) a negligible amount of polyubiquitinated and core-glycosylated T70 CFTR persisted after the initial 2-h chase. radioactivity appeared in the high molecular weight, polyubiquitinated T70 CFTR when MG132 was present during the last 2 h of chase. at least a fraction of polyubiquitinated T70 CFTR originates from the complex-glycosylated form. coexpression of the dominant negative K48RUb with T70 CFTR delayed the disposal of the complex-glycosylated mutant CFTR. deletion of the COOH-terminal Tail Structurally destabilizes CFTR Nonnative or partially denatured soluble proteins are subjected to ubiquitination and/or proteasome-mediated degradation. a similar scenario may prevail for T70 CFTR if the COOH-terminal tail is engaged in the immunoblot analysis of the proteolytic fragments with the L12B4 anti-CFTR Ab recognizing the NBD1 demonstrates a distinct proteolytic digestion pattern and a moderate, but reproducibly increased protease sensitivity of the complex-glycosylated T70 CFTR. similar results were obtained with proteinase K and using the NBD2-specific, M3A7 anti-CFTR Ab. the turnover of the wt CFTR was only marginally affected at 40\u00b0C (t 1/2 10.5 vs. 15 h at 37\u00b0C) the intrinsic structural instability of the T70 CFTR becomes more apparent at elevated temperature. the compact tertiary structures of wt CFTR are resistant to unfolding. synthetic maturation of the T70 and T82 CFTR was significantly impaired at the ER in transient COS-1 or in stable BHK expression systems. we proposed that, in contrast to the most prevalent CF-associated processing mutations, destabilization of the mature form at distal stages of the biosynthetic or endocytic pathway accounts for the phenotypic manifestation of truncated CFTR. the complex and core-glycosylated forms of wt and truncated CFTR could be distinguished by their distinct electrophoretic mobility as well as their endoglycosidase H sensitivity. the parallel decrease in the size of the complex-glycosylated pools of the truncated CFTR suggests that the plasma membrane targeting is largely preserved. complex- and core-glycosylated CFTR indicated by black, white, and hatched arrowheads. expression level of wt and truncated CFTR at cell surface (biotinylated) and at post-ER compartments (complex glycosylated) biotinylated CFTR was precipitated with L12B4 and M3A7 Abs. labeled CFTR was visualized by fluorography. radioactivity of biotinylated forms quantified with PhosphorImage analysis. biotinylated CFTR was immunoprecipitated by L12B4 and M3A7 anti-CFTR Abs. for comparison, 10% of the immunoprecipitate was loaded for fluorography. data represent means SEM, n = 3. (C and D) Proteasome inhibitors delay the degradation of the biotinylated CFTR. degradation rate was unaltered upon exposing cells to NH4Cl, chloroquin, or bafilomycin B. leupeptin and pepstatin A, inhibitors of cathepsins B, H, L, N, S, and T (Seglen 1983), have a negligible effect on the degradation rate. f B; 2 M) and leupeptin plus pepstatin A (leu+pep; 50 g/ml) were present during the entire pulse\u2013chase. CFTR was immunoprecipitated and visualized by fluorography. data represent means SEM, n = 3. ated wt and T70 CFTR was mitigated by NH4Cl and chloroquin. subcellular fractionation was performed after enrichment of short-lived proteolytic intermediates. heavy and light microsomes, containing predominantly lysosomes and Golgi complex plasma membrane, and endosomes, respectively, were isolated on a 25% percoll density gradient. cathepsin inhibitors stabilized the complex-glycosylated wt CFTR by 7\u201310-fold in lysosomes as well as in the light-density fraction. however, only a modest accumulation of T70 CFTR could be documented by immunoblot analysis. similar results were obtained in lysosomes isolated by the calcium-precipitation method. the 26S proteasome is responsible for the degradation of misfolded polypeptides recognized by the ER quality control, short-lived cytosolic, and some plasma membrane proteins after their ligand-induced internalization. the impact of the peptide aldehyde, MG 132 (CBZ-leu-leu-leucinal), and lactacystin, a specific, irreversible inhibitor of the 20S subunit, was assessed. complex transport of the core-glycosylated CFTR with brefeldin A failed to influence the inhibitory effect of lactacystin. neither lactacystin nor MG 132 promoted the processing of the core-glycosylated CFTR. the complex-glycosylated CFTR is stabilized by proteasome inhibitors. cells were treated with lactacystin after the pulse labeling (C) or after the conversion of the core- to complex-glycosylated T70 (D) when indicated, BFA (5 g/ml) was included to prevent the conversion of the residual core-glycosylated form (D and E) lactacystin (10 M), but not leupeptin and pepstatin A (50 g/ml), impedes the degradation of the core-glycosylated form. the degradation of the Tac-Lamp1 chimera is sensitive to the inhibition of the vacuolar H+-ATPase with bafilomycin B (Baf B) the stability of folded T70 CFTR was measured after the elimination of the immature core-glycosylated form. ER retention only marginally increased the half-life of the wt CFTR (t 1/2 14 h vs. 11 h; Fig. 4 F) proteasome inhibitors mitigated the disappearance of Tac-TCR, but not Tac-Lamp1. bafilomycin B, but not the proteasome inhibitors, stabilized Tac-Lamp1. proteasome inhibitors increased the steady state level of the complex-glycosylated truncated CFTR by two- to fourfold. tacystin and MG132 inhibited the turnover of biotinylated T70 CFTR by 2.6- and 1.9-fold, respectively. ubiquitination of the complex-glycosylated T70 CFTR requires polyubiquitin modification. polyubiquitinated T70 CFTR was derived from the core- and/or the complex-glycosylated T70 CFTR. proteasome inhibitors induce the accumulation of the polyubiquitinated T70 CFTR. CFTR\u2013ubiquitin conjugates were isolated with sequential immunoprecipitation. the processing of the pulse-labeled T70 CFTR pool was monitored by visualizing 10% of the CFTR-immunoprecipitate. the experimental protocols were performed on transiently transfected COS-1 cells expressing T70 CFTR and HA-Ub. incubation with protease inhibitors was extended to 4 h as indicated. at least a fraction of polyubiquitinated T70 CFTR is derived from the complex-glycosylated form. the complex-glycosylated form was visualized by immunoprecipitation with anti-CFTR Abs and wheat germ agglutinin affinity chromatography. coexpression of the dominant negative K48RUb with T70 CFTR delayed the disposal of the complex-glycosylated mutant. a large body of evidence demonstrates the existence of intra- and intermolecular interactions in CFTR. in situ protease susceptibility and in vivo thermostability assays were performed. the conformational stability of the complex-glycosylated wt and T70 CFTR was probed with limited proteolytic digestion in conjunction with immunoblotting. microsomes were isolated with differential centrifugation from cells expressing wt or T70 CFTR. they were subjected to limited proteolysis at the indicated concentrations of trypsin for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. the proteolytic digestion pattern was probed by L12B4 anti-CFTR Ab and ECL. complex-glycosylated T70 and wt CFTR were monitored at 26\u00b0C, 37\u00b0C, or 40\u00b0C. the disappearance kinetics of complex-glycosylated T70 and wt CFTR were determined by PhosphorImage analysis in experiments shown in A and B. a post-ER quality control mechanism appears to be responsible for targeting and vacuolar degradation of mutant plasma membrane ATPase, the late Golgi protease Kex2 and a model protein. the complex-glycosylated truncated CFTR is targeted to the plasma membrane with comparable efficiency to its wt counterpart. a dramatic extension of the plasma membrane residence time of biotinylated T70 CFTR was evoked by lactacystin. MG132 and lactacystin evoked the accumulation of polyubiqutinated adducts of the complex-glycosylated T70 CFTR. both MG132 and lactacystin partially restored the expression level of complex-glycosylated T70, 82, and 98 CF proteasome activity is one of the rate-limiting steps for the turnover of the full-length complex-glycosylated T70 CFTR. this could be explained by incomplete inhibition of proteasome activity and/or the involvement of other, presently unidentified proteolytic mechanisms. the COOH-terminal tail of CFTR might confer stability to the mature CFTR by several mechanisms or a combination thereof. nonnative states of soluble polypeptides induced by mutations or thermal or chemical denaturation can lead to accelerated degradation. a key question that remains to be resolved is whether ubiquitination is a prerequisite for proteasome-dependent degradation of the mutant CFTR. several tyrosine kinase and G protein\u2013coupled receptors have been observed to undergo ligand-induced ubiquitination and downregulation via lysosomal and/or proteasomal degradation. ubiquitination also appears to be necessary and sufficient to induce the internalization and downregulation of plasma membrane receptors and transporters. both 26S proteasome and P700 subunit are able to degrade nonnative polypeptides lacking polyubiquitin conjugates. these degradation pathways are not mutually exclusive and may function in parallel. the biochemical as well as functional rescue of cell surface resident T70, but not wt CFTR, by proteasome inhibitors substantiate this hypothesis. both lysosomes and proteasomes are involved in the constitutive and ligand-induced disposal of connexin43, the renal Na/Pi cotransporter, and the PDGF receptor respectively. ubiquitin-proteasome pathway may play a role in the recognition and elimination of the T70 CFTR."}
