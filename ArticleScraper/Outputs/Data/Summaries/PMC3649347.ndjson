{"summary": "acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) are a severe public health issue. a total of 596 nasal and throat swabs were collected from adult patients with ARTIs at the Jinan Central Hospital affiliated with Shandong University. a total of 596 NTSs were collected from adult patients with ARTIs between august 2009 and September 2010. enrolled patients had at least one symptom during acute infection, with high fever (body temperature 38\u00b0C) or chillness or normal/low leukocyte count. informed consent was obtained from each patient. nucleic acid Extraction Total nucleic acids including DNA and RNA were extracted from 200 L of each specimen using a QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin Kit (Qiagen, Mississauga, ON, Canada) according to manufacturer's instructions. PCR/RT-PCR Screening for Respiratory Viruses ADV, HBoV, HCoV, HMPV, IFV, IFV, RSV, PIV, EV, and 596 nasal and throat swabs (NTSs) were collected from adult patients with ARTIs at the Jinan Central Hospital affiliated with Shandong University. enrolled patients had at least one symptom during acute infection, with high fever (body temperature 38\u00b0C) or chillness or normal/low leukocyte count. PCR/RT-PCR Screening for Respiratory Viruses ADV, HBoV, HCoV, HMPV, IFV, RSV, PIV, EV, and HRV viruses were detected by conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or reverse transcription- (RT-) PCR assay. IFV had the highest detection rate (20.81%), followed by HBoV (8.22%), HRV (5.03%), EV (3.69%), and RSV (2.52%). IFVB prevalence peaked at the end of autumn, with a detection rate of 43.75% in November 2009, and increased dramatically to 90.48% in January 2010. IFVC was rarely detected, with only three cases observed sporadically during May and October 2010. HBoV was the second most prevalent viral agent, which had obvious seasonally distributed infection rates in summer and autumn. a 20.98% positive rate for HBoV was observed in July 2010. HRV infections, as the third frequently prevalent virus after HBoV, had no regular seasonality. codetection with two or more than two different viruses was detected in 28 cases (4.70%) one case was found to have a triple infection of PIV2, IFVB, and HBoV. the most common viruses were HBoV and HBoV. IFVA and HBoV codetection were only detected in the 14\u201325-year-old group. HRV and HBoV were only detected in the 26\u201365-year-old age group. IFV had the highest detection rate (20.81%), followed by HBoV. oV (8.22%), HRV (5.03%), EV (3.69%), and RSV (2.52%). HCoV was detected at the lowest positive rate (0.67%). IFVB prevalence peaked at the end of autumn, with a detection rate of 43.75% in November 2009. the seasonal distribution of EV was regular, remaining at a stable detection rate (0.81%) throughout spring before reaching a peak in summer. no cases were observed from October 2009 February 2010. codetection with two or more than two different viruses was detected in 28 cases (4.70%) one case was found to have a triple infection of PIV2, IFVB, and HBoV. the most common viruses in these dual infections were HBoV and IFVA. study of respiratory viruses in adult patients is more limited. prevalence, clinical profile, and epidemiology of respiratory viruses in adults are different from those in young people. there is a clear need to further study the prevalence of respiratory viruses in adults with ARTIs. IFV was the leading pathogen detected in adults with ARTIs. higher incidence of IFVA than IFVB was observed in both Beijing and Shanghai. HBoV has been reported to be associated with respiratory tract disease since 2005. infection in adults was only recorded in a few papers [22\u201324]. a higher infection rate (8.22%) of this virus was observed in our study. avirus was reported as the second main pathogen associated with both URTIs and LRTIs in china. the prevalence of mixed respiratory viruses in adults was lower than that in children. the clinical significance of mixed respiratory viruses remains unclear. nested PCR were provided in detail. preparations of PCR or RT-PCR reactions and the size of corresponding PCR products were also involved."}
