{"summary": "ten third-year medical students who underwent simulation training underwent an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) and a multiple-choice question (MCQ) test to assess their ability to apply the knowledge gained during the simulator training when dealing with real patients. the performance of this group of students was compared with that of a group of ten fourth-year medical students who did not undergo simulation training. a study performed during the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in 2003 explored the utility of teaching cardiac auscultation without patient contact. patients with echocardiographically proven heart disease had their heart sounds recorded on electronic stethoscopes. but there is still a lack of conclusive research on the cost-benefit factors of the use of simulation in education. ten students in third year of medical study were recruited to undergo an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) and multiple-choice question (MCQ) test. the results of the OSCE and MCQ test were examined and a post-examination survey was conducted. students were not exposed to cardiology or internal medicine rotations for about a year. another ten students who were in their fourth year of medical study were recruited to undergo the same OSCE and MCQ test without a post-test survey. each OSCE station examined core clinical competencies in cardiology. the third- and fourth-year medical students did reasonably well in the OSCE. in the examination technique category, the mean score of the third-year medical students was 65% 14%. the fourth-year medical students had undergone one extra year of medical training prior to undergoing the OSCE. compared to the third-year medical students, the fourth-year medical students scored reasonably well in the examination technique category. this is not unexpected in light of the extra year of clinical exposure that the fourth-year medical students had gone through. this is not unexpected in light of the extra year of clinical exposure the fourth-year medical students had gone through. medical students in both groups obtained similar scores. this could be due to the fact that during their second year of medical training, the medical students had undergone a Harvey simulation course. this could be due to the fact that the simulation sessions, together with the integration of their preclinical years with the clinical curriculum, had benefitted the students. traditional bedside teaching is a potentially useful adjunct in medical education. the use of the Harvey simulator is especially useful in helping medical students develop the right examination technique for cardiovascular examination."}
