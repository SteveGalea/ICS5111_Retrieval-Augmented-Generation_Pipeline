{"summary": "heterogeneity of infectiousness has been neglected until some evidence of superspreading has been found. the 20% most infectious individuals may be responsible for more than 80% of cases. heterogeneity increases the growth rate of outbreaks and the probability of stochastic extinction. ruminants mainly lead to late-term abortions and infertility. previous cases of B. melitensis in european wild mountain ruminants were localized events that spontaneously faded out. this unique situation constitutes the very first case of self-sustained infection with B. melitensis in wildlife in Europe. in studies on the wild reservoir of B. abortus in wildlife in the Greater Yellowstone Area (USA), some pathogenesis characteristics of B. abortus were similar between bison (Bison bison) and cattle, but specificities such as increased bison susceptibility were also demonstrated. in the present study, we have addressed the distribution of Brucella in different organs from seropositive, supposedly infected, ibex. an unprecedented high seroprevalence was reported in the Alpine ibex population living in the bargy area, a remote mountain area. a probable spillover occurred from domestic animals to ibex in the 90's and a spillback from ibex to domestic cattle in 2011. two units (1 and 2) showed seroprevalences 15%, whereas seroprevalences of the other three spatial units (3, 4, and 5) reached 54, 70, and 35% respectively. most captures occurred between April and June, corresponding to the last third of pregnancy, on mature animals (2 years old) valence was significantly higher for this age class (Hars et al., 2013). these selective culling operations occurred in spring 2013 (n = 5), autumn 2013 (n = 233), and spring 2014 (n = 18). non-selective culling on unmarked individuals, considered as having a higher risk of being seropositive than marked individuals, was also performed in autumn 2015 (n = 70) a cut-off titer of 20 IU/mL was applied according to EU and OIE requirements. in 2012\u20132013, individuals considered seropositive on the basis of at least two of the four above-mentioned tests were shot after laboratory testing. a trial in field conditions confirmed the reliability of the LFIA. genital swabs (either vaginal or preputial) were performed before necropsy. genital swabs (either vaginal or preputial) were used for bacterial cultures in some individuals in 2013\u20132015. ibex infection status varies according to category of organ infected. four infections statuses in ibex according to previous organ categories. animals being actively infected in organs in the pelvic area were considered as having a risk of potential shedding at the time of capture. bacterial cultures varied among individuals, thus the probability of finding at least one positive culture in an ibex depended on the number of cultures assayed. we analyzed these data using a generalized linear model with a binomial distribution. l generalized linear mixed model expresses the log of the odds of the probability of a bacterial culture being positive as a linear function of the explanatory variables. three models were adjusted to analyze the probability of a bacterial culture being positive in (i) any organ, (ii) organs in the pelvic area, or (iii) urogenital organs. we also used the year of capture as a random effect (YEAR) to control for possible sampling biases. we also considered sample treatment as a fixed effect (fresh or frozen: TREATMENT) model selection was performed using the Akaike Information Criterion corrected for small sample size (AICc) for each candidate model, we examined the Akaike weights (W), which are relative model likelihoods normalized over the likelihoods of all possible sub-models. we chose the final model based on the number of parameters, following the principle of parsimony. re-emergence led to in-depth epidemiological surveys to find the origin of the outbreak. no potential source was identified in other domestic herds (not one infected domestic ruminant out of more than 12,000 tested), suggesting a possible implication of wildlife in this re-emergence. females are structured in 5 distinct socio-spatial units. males were prone to move between units especially during the mating period. seroprevalences of the other three spatial units reached 54, 70, and 35% respectively. ibex were shot (2012\u20132013) or euthanized by veterinarians using an embutramide intravenous injection (T61\u00ae, Intervet, Angers, France, 2014\u20132017) the serological status of these animals was tested using the same assays as for captured animals. a cut-off titer of 20 IU/mL was applied according to EU and OIE requirements. in 2012\u20132013, individuals considered as seropositive on the basis of at least two of the four above-mentioned tests were shot after laboratory testing. a trial in field conditions confirmed the reliability of the LFIA. genital swabs (either vaginal or preputial) were performed in the field (before necropsy) genital swabs (either vaginal or preputial) were used for bacterial cultures in some individuals in 2013\u20132015. the raw data supporting the conclusions of this manuscript will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation, to any qualified researcher. we separated the analyzed organs into three categories in relation to their shedding potential. individuals having at least one positive culture in any organ were considered as actively infected. bacteriological examination is not a method with 100% diagnostic sensitivity. bacteriological examination is not a method with 100% diagnostic sensitivity. we used a mixed model with a binomial distribution. the binomial generalized linear mixed model expresses the log of the odds of a bacterial culture being positive as a linear function of the explanatory variables. three models were adjusted to analyze the probability of a bacterial culture being positive in (i) any organ, (ii) organs in the pelvic area or (iii) urogenital organs. sampling biases were likely in 2012\u20132013 (captures focusing on animals with the most obvious clinical signs or gross lesions) we also used the year of capture as a random effect to control for possible sampling biases. we also considered sample treatment as a fixed effect (fresh or frozen: TREATMENT) model selection was performed using the Akaike Information Criterion corrected for small sample size (AICc), keeping models for which the difference between their AICc value and the lowest AICc value was 2. for each candidate model, we examined the Akaike weights (W), which are relative model likelihoods normalized over the likelihood of all possible sub-models. 81 were necropsied at the LDAV73, whereas only genital swab and blood sampling was performed on the seven remaining animals. most individuals were captured or culled in spring during the last third of gestation (43 females, 28 males), and a few were culled or captured in autumn before the mating period (13 females, 4 males) the number of analyzed organs and the number of positive results are shown in detail in Table 2. positive abscesses and positive samples from other organs came from the spleen (n = 6), udder (5), other lymph nodes (5), lungs (4), nuchal ligament (2), C3/C4 cervical vertebrae (1), cotyledons (1), and mesentery (1). quantitative evaluation of the number of CFU was available for all but 11 positive culture results. in positive tissues/samples, the mean semi-quantitative number of CFU was 2.1 ([1.9\u20132.3]) in positive tissues, the mean semi-quantitative number of CFU was 0.8 in males. the other two fetuses were negative for all analyzed organs. the other two fetuses were negative for all analyzed organs. their mothers were positive for 3 out of 10 and 1 out of 9 analyzed organs respectively. 88 seropositive animals (fetuses excluded) were negative for all analyzed samples. 37 (42%) were negative for all analyzed samples. 51 (58%) were positive for at least one lymph node from the pelvic area. the majority of bacteriologically confirmed ibex (active infection in any organ) had more than one positive sample. the model best fitting the probability of a bacterial culture being positive in any organ included the variables AGE, SEX, TITER and the interaction SEX:TITER. positive bacterial

EATMENT was present in all models with AICc2 but one. fresh samples had higher probabilities of being culture-positive than frozen ones. the interaction AGE:SEX (OR = 1.31 [0.94\u20131.81]) was also present in some models with AICc2. the largest dataset of bacteriological investigations on Alpine ibex infected by Brucella ever collected to date. the probability of bacteria presence decreased with ibex age, in both males and females. the average bacterial load was significantly lower in females than in males. a lack of sensitivity cannot be excluded, which might represent a limit to our results by missing some infected animals. six bacterial cultures were performed on four entirely seronegative individuals from the same area. 17 bacterial cultures were performed on three found-dead animals on which serological tests could not be performed. the list of organs selected for systematic bacteriological examination was only standardized in 2016. the list of organs selected for systematic bacteriological examination was only standardized in 2016. qPCR has been demonstrated as inaccurate to detect all culture-positive animals in bison. proportion of animals with active infection in naturally-infected seropositive cattle was under 50% in several studies. in small domestic ruminants, proportions were more contrasted, with a proportion of 62.2% of actively infected animals among 45 naturally-infected seropositive sheep. several transmission routes have been demonstrated for brucellosis in domestic animals. horizontal transmission through genital secretions, aborted fetuses or products of live births. positive bacterial cultures of testes in genital swabs, genital tracts, and urine/bladders of seropositive Alpine ibex. we also provided the very first indication of possible vertical transmission of B. melitensis in Alpine ibex, with one positive fetus out of the three fetuses analyzed. our results support a possible transmission from females to newborns through the consumption of colostrum or milk. qPCR could have allowed to improve the detection of the bacteria in urogenital organs. but it would not necessarily give us any further information on bacterial shedding. more than half were positive either in genital tract or in lymph nodes from pelvic area. transmission from infected females to viable fetus or through the colostrum or the infected environment after birth. in females, the probability of positive bacterial culture and bacterial carriage was highest for young animals and high CFT titers. infection with B. melitensis often leads to abortion and subsequent Brucella shedding during the last third of the pregnancy. most animals were captured between April and June, i.e., during the last third of pregnancy, thus in a period of potential abortion and shedding in female ibex. the probability of bacterial shedding should be at the highest in primiparous females in relation to abortion. too few pregnant females were integrated in our sample to properly test a relationship between pregnancy status and Brucella shedding. males generally had higher probability of positive culture and higher bacterial load than females. males, even with high bacterial loads, could not be responsible for disease transmission outside the mating period. females can contaminate many susceptible individuals through indirect transmission. the biology of infection remains unknown as regards young or seronegative ibex. we used a cross-sectional study, as it is not easily conceivable to use experimental infection for the study of brucellosis in Alpine ibex. this is critical for future development of control strategies. serological tests are good in domestic animals, i.e. up to 97% in cattle (Godfroid et al., 2010, and references therein) and up to 100% in sheep and goats (European Commission, 2001, and references therein) but are still not well-defined in ibex. a lack of sensitivity cannot be excluded, which might represent a limit to our results by missing some infected animals. the list of organs selected for systematic bacteriological examination was only standardized in 2016, which represents another limit of our study. in future studies, variability between samples would be reduced if the standard protocol implemented since 2016 is still followed. ruminants, proportions were more contrasted, with a proportion of 62.2% of actively infected animals among 45 naturally-infected sheep. a lower proportion has been found in naturally-infected goats. our data supports a high shedding potential in ibex infected by B. melitensis. this could be explained by a high susceptibility of ibex to brucellosis. we did not test the semen or epididymis of males, but positive bacterial cultures of testes in 12/32 (37%) males with more than 100 CFU per plate support the ability of males to transmit the infection through venereal transmission. in seropositive naturally-infected bulls, Hill (1983) found positive bacterial cultures of testes in 2/17 (12%) of animals. the proportion of active infections in urogenital organs was probably underestimated. qPCR could have allowed to improve the detection of the bacteria in urogenital organs. but it would not necessarily give us any further information on bacterial shedding. the biology of infection in ibex under 2 years of age remains unknown. one cannot exclude that young ibex individuals may play an unrecognized role in brucellosis dynamics since they might get infected early in life. in females, the probability of positive bacterial culture and bacterial carriage was highest for young animals and high CFT titers. infection with B. melitensis in primiparous females often leads to abortion and subsequent Brucella shedding during the last third of the pregnancy. too few pregnant females were integrated in our sample to properly test a relationship between pregnancy status and Brucella shedding. shedding in old females could have been underestimated because too few captures occurred during the birth period. males with low CFT titers could carry high amounts of Brucella. shedding and previous results on the spatial behavior and contact patterns of Alpine ibex in the study population (Marchand et al., 2017) support two different epidemiological roles for males and females. females play a role of maintenance of the infection inside each spatial unit of the Bargy Massif. males of all ages tend to visit all subunits during the mating period. heterogeneity due to age and sex can impact the efficacy of management methods such as culling based on the serological status of individuals or groups. in the present case, removing old animals might have contributed to limited efficacy of the mass culling performed in 2013. conflict of interest
