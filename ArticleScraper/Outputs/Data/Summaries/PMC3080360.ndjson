{"summary": "advanced age was significantly associated with increased SARS-related pathogenicity and deaths due to rapidly progressive respiratory compromise. zoonotic phase was characterized by strains isolated from palm civets and raccoon dogs in live animal markets. early phase was characterized by several independent human cases, likely due to zoonotic transmission. a heterologous challenge model is needed to test cross-protection efficacy of vaccine candidates. several animal models for SARS-CoV exist, including mice, hamsters, ferrets and non-human primates. all viruses replicated to near similar titers and induced similar pathologic changes of mild disease. no overt clinical symptoms were seen in any of the infected animals. minor transient lymphopenia was seen on days 1 and 2 p.i. in all infected animals. infection with GZ02 did not result in significant radiological changes early in infection, although mild increase in interstitial infiltrates could be observed in 1 animal on day 2. no infectious virus could be isolated on 14 days p.i. in any of the tissues. virus replication was determined in tissues on day 1 (A) and day 4 (B) by virus titration. samples from three animals were assayed and analyzed and the mean titers were calculated as pfu/gr. error bars represent the standard error of the mean. perivascular inflammation was observed within the lungs as well as a multifocal, minimal to mild increase of lymphocytes, macrophages and fewer neutrophils and eosinophils. urbani viral protein could be detected in tracheal epithelial cells and in alveolar pneumocytes at day 1 p.i. trachea (A, B, C, D, G, H, K, L) and lung (E, F, I, J, M, N) sections were stained with H&E or immunohistochemical detection of SARS-CoV nucleoprotein (B, D, F, H, J, L, N) no positive IHC staining was detected in trachea sections from control (B) or HC/SZ/61/03 (L) infected animals. infected animals were euthanized on day 4 and trachea (C, D, G, H, K, L) and lung (A, B, E, F, I, J, M, N) sections were stained with H&E or immunohistochemical detection of SARS-CoV nucleoprotein (B, D, F, H, J, L, N) no virus positive cells were observed in the trachea at 4 days p.i. in any of the animals. decreased numbers of alveolar pneumocytes were still positive for viral protein in the lungs of mice infected with the 3 different spike glycoprotein variants. functional annotations (C) and canonical pathways (D) were determined to better understand the biological functions associated with SARS-CoV infection in cynomolgus macaques. the top 3 functions and canonical pathways were identical for all 3 SARS-CoV strains. mRNA expression of IL-1ra, IL-2, IL12/23 (p40), IL-13, MCP-1 and Mip-1 in lung tissue was increased in animals infected with the different SARS-CoV strains. the levels of IL-1ra, IL-2, IL12/23 (p40), IL-13, MCP-1 and Mip-1 in lung tissue were elevated in animals infected with the different SARS-CoV strains compared to the concentrations of cytokines were determined in lung homogenates (A) and plasma (B) on days 1 and 4 post infection. no overt clinical symptoms were seen in any of the infected animals. no significant changes were observed in blood chemistry. radiological changes in HC/SZ/61/03 infected animals were very similar to Urbani infected animals. one animal showed a clear progression on day 2 with small ventral-most consolidation in left lung (right lateral view) and heavy peribronchial markings. notable improvement was seen by day 4 with mild interstitial infiltrates centrally. no infectious virus could be isolated on 14 days p.i. in any of the tissues. titers in urbani infected animals were generally 1 to 2 logs higher. the levels of viral RNA were similar for each SARS-CoV strain at each time point but decreased over time. titers were calculated as pfu/mL. titers were calculated as pfu/mL. the error bars represent the standard error of the mean. controls (A, B), urbani (C, D, E, F), GZ02 (G, H, I, J) and HC/SZ/61/03 (K, L, M, N) infected animals were euthanized on day 1. trachea stained sections of trachea (A, C, G, K) with minimally increased numbers of lymphocytes, macrophages and neutrophils within the tracheal submucosa IHC stained sections of trachea (C, G, K) with lymphocytes, macrophages, eosinophils and neutrophils within submucosa and intraepithelial neutrophils. IHC stained sections of lung (A, E, I, M) with no positive staining of tracheal epithelium. a persistence of perivasculitis, peribronchiolitis and peribronchitis was observed by day 4 p.i. a persistence of alveolar septal pneumonitis and alveolitis was observed in animals infected with all 3 SARS-CoV strains. no virus positive cells were observed in the trachea at 4 days p.i. in any of the animals. differentially expressed genes are the result of a comparison of gene expression in the lungs of cynomolgus macaques versus gene expression in the lungs of mock-infected animals. genes were included if they met the criteria of an absolute change of 2-fold (P0.05). some of the highest differentially expressed genes included CXCL10, CXCL11, ISG15 and MX1. mRNA expression of IL-1ra, MCP-1 and Mip-1a was increased in SARS-CoV infected animals. levels of IL-1ra, IL-2, IL12/23 (p40), IL-13, MCP-1 and Mip-1 in lung tissue were elevated compared to those in control animals on days 1 or 4 p.i. peaking on day 1 p.i. but not on day 14 p.i. no significant differences were found between the 3 SARS-CoV strains. a panel of these recombinant SARS-CoV bearing variants developed new models of SARS-CoV infection in non-human primates. this could be used to test vaccine candidates and therapeutics against heterologous challenge. cynomolgus macaques can be infected with SARS-CoV, although the clinical presentation is variable [15], [21], [22], [23]. the recombinant SARS-CoV strains bearing the variant S glycoproteins were all constructed in the Urbani background. both the Urbani and GZ02 strains replicated efficiently in human airway epithelium. the zoonotic strains including HC/SZ/61/03 did not [19]. we hypothesize that the SARS-CoV S glycoproteins from the different zoonotic and human phases of the epidemic may differentially down-regulate ACE2. but unlike in the mouse model, no differences in ACE2 expression could be observed by gene expression or immunohistochemistry in cynomolgus macaques. this could be due to the mild disease progression observed in the current model. infection by the intrabronchial route results in initial virus replication in the interstitium, resulting in radiological changes in the lower lobes early during infection. the radiological changes correlated with the observed histopathology in the lungs. cynomolgus macaques can be infected with zoonotic and early human epidemic phase SARS-CoV strains. cynomolgus macaques can be infected with zoonotic and early human epidemic phase SARS-CoV strains. the epidemic strains are extinct; however zoonotic strains may still emerge from animal reservoirs like bats, palm-civets and raccoondogs. a vaccine should confer long-term protection against replication and shedding of both the epidemic strains and any zoonotic strain that may emerge. animals were anesthetized for challenge, clinical examination, temperature, respiration rate, chest radiographs, blood draw and swabs of nasal, oral and rectal mucosa on days 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 11 and 14 p.i. animals were fed commercial monkey chow, treats and fruit twice daily. euthanized and necropsied on days 1, 4 and 14 p.i. with collection of clinical specimens from oral and nasal mucosa, trachea, left and right bronchi, left and right lung (upper, middle and lower lobes), spleen, liver, kidney, heart, cervical and bronchial lymph nodes. radiographs were interpreted and assigned a numeric score by a veterinary radiologist who was blinded to the serum biochemistry was analyzed from heparin blood using the iSTAT1 laser. urea nitrogen (BUN), glucose, chloride, sodium, potassium, hematocrit, hemoglobin, pH, PCO2, TCO2, base excess (BEecf) and anion gap values were evaluated using the Crea cartridges. natants from swabs and tissue homogenates were serially diluted in DMEM. after 1 hour of incubation, the cells were overlaid with 0.8% agarose-containing medium. two days later, the plates were stained with crystal violet. RNA was purified using RNeasy 96 kit (Qiagen) as described previously. aliquot of sample RNA was used to quantify the three SARS-CoV strains.
