{"summary": "a laboratoryconfirmed outbreak of pandemic A/H1N1 [A(H1N1)pdm09] influenza was reported in an elementary school in a rural community of British Columbia, Canada. the school includes students of Aboriginal and nonAboriginal backgrounds drawn from the local town and surrounding First Nations reserves. initial findings from this investigation have previously been published. household information included age, flulike symptoms and related dates of onset, days spent in bed, health care visits, comorbidity, and receipt of 2008\u20132009 and/or 2007\u20132008 TIV. households with at least one member reporting ILI were subsequently invited to provide blood specimens from both symptomatic and asymptomatic household members. with ILI, the duration of illness was estimated using information on the date of symptom onset and resolution as reported by participants. we fit nonparametric Kaplan\u2013Meier distribution to the data to estimate median duration. we also fit loglogistic distribution. local health authorities were notified on April 28, 2009. nasopharyngeal specimens confirmed A(H1N1)pdm09 as the cause on may 3, 2009. the school was closed on may 1, 2009 and reopened May 11, 2009. the SAR was defined as the proportion of household members who developed symptoms after the index case within a household. the duration of illness was estimated using information on the date of symptom onset and resolution as reported by participants. the weibull model achieved the lowest Akaike information criterion (AIC) of these distributions. we computed median serial interval and its 95% confidence interval (CI) this survey was conducted as a public health authorized outbreak investigation. n = 253 Onreserve n = 191 Combined n = 408 Overall n (%)* ILI n (%)** MAILI n (%)** Overall n (%)* ILI n (%)** MAILI n (%)** Overall attack rate 66 (26) 25 (10) 44 (23) 25 (13) 92 (23) 36 (9) Age category (years) 1\u20138 67 (26) 32 (48) 14 (21) 42 (22) 16 (38) 14 (33) vaccination status no 208 (82) 47 (23) 13 (6) 125 (65) 20 (16) 9 (7) 318 (78) 63 (20) 18 (6) Yes 45 (18) 19 (42) 12 (27) 66 (35) 24 (36) 16 (24) 90 (22) 29 (32) 18 (20) 2007\u201308 vaccination status No 197 (79) 42 (22) 11 (6) 115 (61) 16 (14) 7 (6) 299 (75) 56 (19) 16 (5) Yes 53 (21) 24 (45) 14 (26) 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 a comparable but small proportion sought care within 48 hours of onset of symptom onset. none was prescribed antivirals and none was hospitalized. duration of illness varied by selfreported severity of illness. risk factors in multivariable GLMM analysis among school A and onreserve households combined, younger age (1\u20138 yoa: OR = 52, 95% CI: 261\u20131036; 9\u201319 yoa: OR = 187, 95% CI: 095\u2013369 compared to 20 yoa), presence of comorbidity (OR = 265, 95% CI: 116\u2013605) and receipt of 2008\u20132009 TIV (OR = 238, 206 (114\u2013371) 268 (137\u2013525) 261 (134\u2013509) 238 (126\u201345) Aboriginal people No 1 1 1 Onreserve Aboriginal people 096 (055\u2013167) 074 (04\u201314) 071 (039\u201313) Not included Household density 1st\u20133rd 1 1 4th quartile 134 (073\u2013246) 117 (06\u2013228) Not included *Estimates based on generalized linear mixed models. 95% CI: 112\u20131030) and receipt of 2008\u20132009 TIV (OR = 278, 95% CI: 190\u2013641) were each associated with A(H1N1)pdm09related illness (Table S2). Secondary cases Overall, the SAR was 49/339 (22%). excluding onreserve households, this was 19/94 (20%). serial interval The estimated median SI using both index and secondary case pairs with ILI was 34 days (95% CI: 21\u2013513). the maximum interval between onset dates of primary and secondary cases was 421 days (16\u2013978) the overall analysis of epidemiologic characteristics based on the telephone survey included 408 participants, 253 from school A and 191 participants who lived on reserve. characteristics of the school A and onreserve participants were slightly younger than the onreserve participants. overall attack rate 66 (26) 25 (10) 44 (23) 25 (13) 92 (23) 36 (9) Age category (years) 1\u20138 67 (26) 32 (48) 14 (21) 42 (22) 16 (38) 14 (33) 96 (24) 37 (39) 18 (19) 9\u201319 86 (34) 22 (26) 7 (8) 58 (30) 12 (21) 5 (9) 135 (33) 29 (21) 9 (7) 20\u201349 89 (35) 11 (12) 3 (3) 65 (34) 10 (15) Aboriginal people no 180 (77) 43 (24) 8 (4) \u2013 \u2013 180 (46) 43 (24) 8 (4) Yes, offreserve 18 (8) 2 (11) 1 (6) \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 18 (5) 2 (11) 1 (6) \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 18 (5) 2 (11) 1 (6) Yes, onreserve 36 (15) 18 (50) 14 (39) \u2013 44 (23) 25 (13) 191 (49) 44 (23) 25 (13) Household density 1st quartile the overall ILI rate decreased with age: higher in children 1\u20138 years of age (yoa) among school A (48%), onreserve (38%) and overall (39%) participants. those with chronic conditions also had higher frequency of ILI overall (35% versus 21%) and among onreserve participants (37% versus 21%) of 92 individuals with ILI, 34 (37%) reported mild, 40 (43%) moderate, and 18 (20%) severe illness. median duration of illness varied by selfreported severity of illness. onreserve participants also had slightly longer duration of illness compared to nonAboriginal people. 65, 95% CI: 116\u2013605), and receipt of 2008\u20132009 TIV (OR = 238, 95% CI: 126\u201345) were associated with increased risk of A(H1N1)pdm09related illness. sample size did not support estimates by specific comorbidity. offreserve Aboriginal people excluded from analysis owing to sparse data. younger age (1\u20138 yoa: OR = 933, 95% CI: 382\u20132282; 9\u201319 yoa: OR = 276 95% CI: 114\u2013617 compared to 20 yoa) the SAR among onreserve households was 23/94 (24%). the SAR among school A households that were also onreserve was 13/25 (52%). the SAR among school A participants was 53%, 57%, 26%, 12%, 0%, and 0%. serial interval The estimated median SI using both index and secondary case pairs with ILI was 34 days (95% CI: 21\u2013513). the maximum interval between onset dates of primary and secondary cases was 10 days (16\u2013978) participants onreserve were more likely to report comorbidity and greater household crowding. median interval between symptom onset and care seeking was about 5 days. median time to recovery was 9 days, both longer among onreserve participants. 9, 13, 14, 15, 16 People with comorbidities were more likely to report ILI in our study. comorbidity has also been reported to be associated with higher risk of more severe disease. the overall SAR was 22%, higher in those age 1 year (38%) and 1\u20134 years (50%). the initiation of treatment for the index case upon illness onset or the following day was associated with a 42% reduction in secondary infections in households in a study by Morgan et al. 16 (SAR: 4\u201313%) most of the index cases (72%) had received treatment. our estimate of the A(H1N1)pdm09 serial interval (34 days) is comparable to that reported by others using similar methods and laboratoryconfirmed index cases from various countries and settings. the study relied upon a nonspecific clinical outcome (ILI) for defining A(H1N1)pdm09related illness. participants with and without onreserve residency were at higher risk of illness. the reasons for this warrant better understanding. early features of the first wave of the 2009 pandemic should be considered in preparing for emergence of the next novel influenza virus. risk factors for A(H1N1)pdm09related illness in elementary school population Table S2 References 1.
