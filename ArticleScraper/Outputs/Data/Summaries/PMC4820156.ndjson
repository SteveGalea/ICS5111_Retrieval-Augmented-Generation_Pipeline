{"summary": "in water-borne outbreaks, the connection between poor microbial water quality and disease can be quickly identified. the impact of non-compliant drinking water samples due to E. coli taken for regular monitoring on the incidence of notified acute gastrointestinal infections has not yet been studied. burden of diseases caused by food-borne and waterborne pathogens remains largely unknown globally, but it is probably high. diarrhea associated with infections resulting from oral-fecal contamination is the second leading cause of death in children under 5 years of age. a comprehensive literature review identifies 1415 species of infectious organisms known to be pathogenic to humans, including 217 viruses and prions, 538 bacteria and rickettsia, 307 fungi, 66 protozoa and 287 helminths. some pathogens are transmitted by water, such as norovirus, enterovirus, hepatitis A and E virus, adenovirus, coronavirus, influenza A virus, polyoma virus since 2004, the monitoring in Slovenia completely complies with Council Directive 98/83/EC (15) it has been repeatedly discovered that the quality of drinking water in some small supply zones in Slovenia does not comply with the standards. small supply zones are supplied by surface water, or they are in contact with the surface. the most frequent cases were noroviral (the incidence rate in 2010 was 21/100 000) and rotaviral infections (the incidence rate 78/100 000) the most frequent ones were noroviral (the incidence rate in 2010 was 21/100 000) patients with the following ICD-10 codes were extracted from the database. notified cases coded as bacterial food-borne intoxications were not included. Cryptosporidiosis and amoebiasis were not included in the analysis. the sampling points are determined by the supplier, in collaboration with the regional unit of the National Institute of Public Health (NIJZ) the results of the regular drinking water monitoring intended for human consumption was collected from the Database of Drinking Water Systems and of the compliance of drinking water for 2010. 402 (2.8 %) notified AGI cases that could not be appropriately spatially located were excluded from the study. the flowchart of the data (notified acute gastrointestinal infection cases and the results of drinking water monitoring) exclusion and linking. supply zones could not be geolocated as polygons. some records in the drinking-water supply surveillance sample point dataset had wrong coordinates of the surveillance location or sampling point. unresolved cases could be solved manually. patients with the following ICD-10 codes were extracted from the database. notified cases coded as bacterial food-borne intoxications (ICD-10 code A05) were not included. Cryptosporidiosis and amoebiasis were not included. the samples collected for monitoring should be taken at the point of compliance \u2013 from the taps of users. the sampling points are determined by the supplier, in collaboration with the regional unit of the National Institute of Public Health (NIJZ) the results of the regular drinking water monitoring intended for human consumption was collected from the Database of Drinking Water Systems and of the compliance of drinking water for 2010. 402 (2.8 %) notified AGI cases that could not be appropriately spatially located were excluded from the study. the flowchart of the data (notified acute gastrointestinal infection cases and the results of drinking water monitoring) exclusion and linking. supply zones could not be geolocated as polygons. some records in the drinking-water supply surveillance sample point dataset had wrong coordinates of the surveillance location or sampling point. unresolved cases were excluded from the analysis. the incidence of salmonella infections has been declining since 2004. the number of water supply zones, the number of users, the percentage of users in each supply zone class and the percentage of non-compliant E. coli samples in Slovenia in 2010. the number of water supply zones, the number of users, the percentage of users in each supply zone class and the percentage of non-compliant E. coli samples in Slovenia in 2010. the percentages of non-compliant samples due to the presence of E. coli in small supply zones were 18.9%, 3,7% and 0.5% respectively. the burden of coliform bacteria in larger supply zones was significantly smaller, less than 10/100 ml (the data is not shown) the relative risk for users of small, medium and large supply zones contaminated with E. coli was 1.25 (95 % CI 1.12 \u2013 1.40) there was no increased risk for users supplied by medium supply zones. the RR to get AGI was 0.51 (95 % CI 0.37 \u2013 0.71) the reported incidence of Salmonella infections has been declining since 2004. the reported incidence of salmonella infections has been associated, at least in part, with successful infection control programmes in poultry farming and industry. the data is not shown. the percentages of non-compliant samples due to the presence of E. coli in small supply zones were 18.9%, 3,7% and 0.5% respectively. the burden of coliform bacteria in small supply zones was significantly smaller, less than 10/100 ml (the data is not shown) the relative risk for users of small, medium and large supply zones contaminated with E. coli was 1.25 (95 % CI 1.12 \u2013 1.40) there was no increased risk for users supplied by medium supply zones. there was no increased risk for users supplied by medium supply zones. in 2010, the incidence rate of notified cases with gastrointestinal communicable disease was app. 1000 per 100 000 inhabitants (21) the real burden is probably much higher as many patients with acute gastroenterocolitis do not seek medical help. a downward trend has been observed for salmonellosis and shigellosis. but not for campylobacteriosis (24) there were settlements with a high incidence of AGI. the main driving force behind the differences observed might be that some physicians are keen to notify and others are not. a drop in the number of notified outbreaks related to drinking water has been observed. individual water systems and systems supplied by ground water were more at risk of contamination. a high prevalence of enteric viruses has been found in untreated individual drinking water sources in Slovenia as well. microbiological quality is strongly associated with the size of the supply zone. small supply zones often have deficiencies in their management plans. only 1\u20132 samples per year taken in the smallest supply zone systems do not fully show the quality of the water. the real burden of AGI in microbiologically contaminated areas is expected to be much higher than the one based on notifications. the last limitation of the study remains the universal, global use of bacterial indicators of fecal contamination of water. existing bacterial indicators and indicators do not identify all potential pathogens; their presence in water is also \u201cunderreported\u201d. the ecological study showed the correlation between the frequency of notified AGI and non-compliant fecal results of drinking water quality monitoring. small water systems must comply with all the professional structural and operational demands."}
