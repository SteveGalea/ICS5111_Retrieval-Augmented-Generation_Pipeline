{"summary": "children aged 5 to 13 years who had an ARI were enrolled from the outpatient department (OPD) 1 or 2 days/week; patients who presented to the ED were enrolled 1 to 4 days/week. ARI was defined as an illness that presented with fever and/or 1 or more of the following symptoms: cough, earache, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sore throat, vomiting after coughing, wheezing, and/or shallow breathing. the RT-PCR assay was designed using a dual-labeled fluorescent probe targeting the nucleoprotein (N) gene. sample aliquots were collected in lysis buffer and frozen at 70\u00b0C until shipped in batches to Vanderbilt University for RNA extraction and real-time RT-PCR. caretakers were interviewed to obtain demographic and clinical information. information on conditions considered to confer higher risk for respiratory illnesses, including premature birth (36 weeks\u2019 gestation), chronic pulmonary disease (including asthma), cardiac, renal, or immunodeficiency disease, cancer, or sickle cell anemia. a total of 1055 children aged 5 to 13 years with ARI were enrolled and provided respiratory samples. 54 (5.1%) of them tested positive for HMPV. in 48 (88.9%) of these 54 cases, HMPV was the only virus detected, whereas RSV was detected with HMPV in 4 (7.4%) of the 54. 15 (20) Hispanic 13 (24) 168 (17) 181 (17) Other 6 (11) 88 (9) 94 (9) Unknown 0 (0) 1 (0) 1 (0) High-risk preexisting conditionc 26 (48) 447 (45) 473 (45).615 Child born >1 mo early (N = 68) (n [%]) 1 (25) 14 (23) 15 (23).964 Clinical features of illness (n [%]) Cough 53 (98) 848 among 54 children with HMPV infection, 22 (41%) presented to an ED. 32 (59%) presented to an OPD. ages and comorbidities present were similar among the children who presented to an ED. children who presented to an ED were significantly more likely to have a discharge diagnosis of asthma (10 [45%] of 22) and less likely to be diagnosed with otitis media (1 [5%] of 22) a previous diagnosis of asthma was present in 437 (41.4%) of 1055 of the study children. we found no difference between the proportions of high-risk preexisting conditions in the HMPV-positive group and those in the HMPV-negative group. however, children with an infection in which HMPV was detected were significantly more likely to be assigned a discharge diagnosis code of pneumonia, other ARI, or bronchiolitis. 7% of children evaluated in an outpatient clinic or ED and 6% of hospitalized children. no significant association with preexisting conditions was observed in the outpatient/ED setting in the younger children. rates of HMPV-associated hospitalization are highest among children 6 months old. the prevalence of HMPV detection among outpatients in our study suggests that children aged >5 years might contribute substantially to this burden. the study population might not be representative of the entire US population or that of other locations, despite the large number of patients enrolled at our 3 study sites."}
