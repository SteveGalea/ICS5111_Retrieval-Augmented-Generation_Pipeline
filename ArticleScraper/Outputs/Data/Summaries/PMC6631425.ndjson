{"summary": "evolution in gradually changing environments has been modeled as a process of adaptation to a moving optimum [17,18,19,20] the lower the rate of change, the smaller the drop in fitness the population experiences in each of the environments to which it is exposed. rapid environmental changes usually produce strong fitness drops that severely decrease the population size and thus the associated genetic diversity. phenotypes obtained under rapid environmental change were fitter [31,32,35] or contained a greater diversity of mutations than those evolving at a slower pace [13,12]. phenotypes obtained under rapid environmental change were fitter [31,32,35] or contained a greater diversity of mutations than those evolving at a slower pace [13,12]. a temperature increase of fixed magnitude but variable rate influenced evolutionary outcomes in an RNA bacteriophage. we used as a model the bacteriophage Q, which infects Escherichia coli strains expressing the F pilus that acts as the virus receptor. the optimal temperature for replication of this virus is 37 \u00b0C (the host temperature) the temperature for Q replication was increased from 37 \u00b0C to 43 \u00b0C either suddenly or following two patterns of gradual change. a variant that could replicate at 43 \u00b0C was needed to analyze the adaptive process of Q as a function of the rate of temperature change. 2.1. Evolution of Bacteriophage Q under Different patterns of temperature increase Populations Q-t2 and Q-t25 were the origin for further evolution at an increased temperature following three patterns of change. the sudden pattern (S) entailed an abrupt exposure to 43 \u00b0C, after which the temperature was kept constant. the sudden pattern (S) consisted of 60 transfers carried out at 43 \u00b0C. in the two-step pattern (TS), the virus was propagated for 30 transfers at 40 \u00b0C followed by 30 additional transfers at 43 \u00b0C. the gradual pattern (G) involved an increase of 1 \u00b0C every 10 transfers. results obtained with the lineages evolved at a higher-than-optimal temperature showed that virus propagation at temperatures above 38 \u00b0C always produced fitness increases at 43 \u00b0C. fitness increased much faster in populations suddenly exposed to 43 \u00b0C, particularly in lineages S-t25, where most of the increase took place during the first 10 transfers.

Q-t2 did not show any mutation relative to the sequence of the Q genome cloned in pBRT7Q. both populations presented a uracil at positions 1257 and 2249. the total number of mutations in each genome is shown on the right part of the figure. Mutations present at transfer number 60 in the sets of lineages propagated through different patterns of temperature increase. 105 (located in 23 nucleotide positions) were non synonymous, which is a clear excess over the number of synonymous mutations. 105 (located in 23 nucleotide positions) were non synonymous. the distribution of mutated positions common to and exclusive of the different treatments is represented in Figure 5. some substitutions were present in at least one lineage of each of the three sets S-t25, TS-t25, and G-t25. the same substitutions, together with six additional ones, were also represented in at least one lineage of the two sets. mutated positions common to S-t2 and S-t25, and non-mutated in the progressive treatments are shown in green. the results showed that lineages S-t2 had higher nucleotide diversity than lineages St-25 (3.2 103 vs. 2.1 103) evolution through any of the progressive treatments led to lower nucleotide diversity. evolution of the Consensus Sequences through Adaptation. we determined the consensus sequence of all evolutionary lineages every 10 transfers. the results showed that lineages S-t25 acquired mutations much more rapidly than the rest during the first 10 transfers. substitutions A1930G and G1312A were not found amongst the first fixed in the sudden treatment. substitution A1930G was not present at any transfer in any of the lineages evolved constantly at 43 \u00b0C, and was lost or became less conspicuous in all lineages evolving through the progressive treatments. mutations were detected for the first time in the range of 38\u201340 \u00b0C or at temperatures above 40 \u00b0C in the lineages TS-t25 and G-t25. most mutations appeared for the first time in the range of 38\u201340 \u00b0C or at temperatures above 40 \u00b0C in the lineages TS-t25 and G-t25. substitutions A1088G, A1778G, G2223A, and C2384T were first detected at temperatures above 40 \u00b0C. all except A1778G were also present in the lineages evolving at a constant 43 \u00b0C. in the two-step pattern (TS), the virus was propagated for 30 transfers at 40 \u00b0C followed by 30 additional transfers at 43 \u00b0C. the gradual pattern (G) involved an increase of 1 \u00b0C every 10 transfers. temperatures above this value decreased the virus yield in an almost exponential way. a higher-than-optimal temperature showed that virus propagation at 38 \u00b0C always produced fitness increases at 43 \u00b0C. fitness increased much faster in populations suddenly exposed to 43 \u00b0C, particularly in lineages S-t25, in which most of the increase took place during the first 10 transfers. 1 Relative Fitness at Transfer 60 Fitness Difference (First 10 Transfers at 43 \u00b0C) S-t2.1 16.3 3.3 0.6 S-t2.2 16.9 3.0 0.3 S-t2.3 21.5 3.1 0.9 S-t2 (Mean SD) 18.2 2.8 3.1 0.1 0.6 0.3 S-t25.1 8.1 2.7 1.2 S-t25.2 6.8 3.0 1.5 S-t25.3 7.0 3.1 1.4 S-t25 (Mean variation in fitness values during the first 10 transfers carried out at 43 \u00b0C. differences in fitness values during the first 10 transfers showed marked differences. in populations with the same ancestor, fitness gains were much higher in lineages St-25. Q-t2 did not show any mutation relative to the sequence of the Q genome cloned in pBRT7Q. both populations presented a uracil at positions 1257 and 2249. there were no statistically significant differences in the number of mutations per genome.

Mutated positions common to S-t2 and S-t25, and non-mutated in the progressive treatments are shown in green. nucleotide diversity among replicate lineages was evaluated as the number of pair-wise differences between genomes divided by the number of analyzed nucleotides. the results showed that lineages S-t2 had higher nucleotide diversity than lineages St-25. we determined the consensus sequence of all evolutionary lineages every 10 transfers (Supplementary Figure S1) during the first 10 transfers, lineages S-t25 acquired mutations much more rapidly than the rest. from transfer 40 onwards, there were no significant differences in the number of mutations between any set of evolutionary lineages. substitutions A1930G and G1312A were not found amongst the first fixed in the sudden treatment. substitution A1930G was not present at any transfer in any of the lineages evolved constantly at 43 \u00b0C. most of the substitutions among those first fixed in lineages S-t25 were absent in the lines TS-t25 and G-25. mutations were present at some point of the transfer series, and disappeared or decreased their representation at later transfers. most mutations appeared for the first time in the range of 38\u201340 \u00b0C or at temperatures above 40 \u00b0C in the lineages TS-t25 and G-t25. most mutations appeared for the first time in the range of 38\u201340 \u00b0C or at temperatures above 40 \u00b0C. substitutions A1088G, A1778G, G2223A, and C2384T were first detected at temperatures above 40 \u00b0C. all except A1778G were also present in the lineages evolving at a constant 43 \u00b0C. previous studies showed a discrepancy in the capacity of this virus to withstand high temperatures. pBRT7Q mutants were found in the evolutionary lineages analyzed in this work, all with origin in pBRT7Q. mutations that facilitate adaptation of Q to increased temperature were already present in the virus prior to high-temperature exposure. pBRT7Q mutants could exert similar effects under other unrelated selective pressures. mutations in lineages S-t25 subjected to different treatments had different effects on fitness and/or they accumulated at a different rate. the fast selection of these mutations in lineages S-t25 suggests that their ancestor population contained some genomes that either had beneficial effects at 43 \u00b0C or could facilitate the acquisition of adaptive mutations at this temperature. decrease in the rate of adaptation indicates that better-adapted populations have already used most of the beneficial mutations available or that beneficial mutations have weaker effects on fitter genotypes. the latter is a form of epistasis known as diminishing returns epistasis [58,59] that seems to represent a generic negative coupling among beneficial mutations. adaptation in lineages S-t25 suggests presence of some genomes containing mutations that facilitate adaptation to 43 \u00b0C. this fact can also underlie the higher nucleotide diversity among replicate lineages and the larger number of transfers that is required for the fixation of the first set of mutations in lineages S-t2. kashiwagi et al. [60] prepared several site-directed mutants containing different sets of mutations among those selected at a high temperature. all the combinations of assayed mutations increased the phage adsorption rate and decreased the latent period at 43.6 \u00b0C. the same site-directed mutants displayed decreased thermal stability at 43.8 \u00b0C. the analysis of the mutational dynamics at the molecular level would need to track the changes in the frequency of particular substitutions through time. this would be very useful to determine which associations of mutations are favored (such as U2016C, U3311G, and C3903U), and to determine the intra-population dynamics of adaptation. normal infections were carried out in NB medium (8 g/L Nutrient Broth from Merck and 5 g/L NaCl) cultures were treated with 1/20 volume of chloroform for 15 min at 37 \u00b0C with shaking (300 rpm) titers were determined by a plaque assay that was carried out by mixing 300 L of exponential phase bacteria with 100 L of the phage suspension. evolutionary lineages were carried out in triplicate and corresponded to Q-t25 propagated through three patterns of change. sudden (lineages S-t25.1, S-t25.2, and TS-t25.3), two steps (lineages TS-t25.1, TS-t25.2, and TS-t25.3), and gradual (lineages G-t25.1, G-t25.2, and TS-t25.3), and to Q-t2 RNAs were used for cDNA synthesis with the avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega), followed by PCR amplification using Expand high-fidelity DNA polymerase (Roche) the oligonucleotide primers used for PCR have been described previously. the supernatant of an overnight culture obtained from a transformed colony was used to infect an E. coli Hfr (Hayes) in semisolid agar at a multiplicity of infection (moi) that allowed for the generation of well-separated lytic plaques. the virus progeny contained in a randomly chosen lytic plaque was the origin of all the populations used in this study. coli cultures were inoculated with 104 pfu in a final volume of 1 mL. after 2 h of incubation, the virus supernatant was collected. a fraction of it was used to infect a fresh E. coli culture. the process was repeated for a total of 25 serial transfers. RNA was extracted by treatment of the virus supernatants with 1/10 vol. 10% SDS, 1/10 vol. 50% -mercaptoethanol, and 1 L of RNasine. RNA samples were resuspended in RNase-free water and stored at 80 \u00b0C. the mutations, fixed or polymorphic, that were detected in each evolutionary lineage were visually inspected in the chromatograms of the other lineages."}
