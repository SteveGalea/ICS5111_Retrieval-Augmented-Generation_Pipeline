{"summary": "mammalian antiviral defenses rely on the combined functions of a vast collection of immunity genes. innate, or cell intrinsic, antiviral immunity establishes an antiviral state in cells by signaling through the cytokine interferon (IFN) and subsequent upregulation of hundreds of genes known collectively as IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) IFITs appeared to function similarly to another critical mediator of the innate immune system, Protein Kinase R (PKR), by globally inhibiting mRNA translation. the recognition of cytoplasmic double-stranded RNA triggers its activity and the global repression of protein synthesis. it has been challenging to determine how IFITs discriminate viral from host RNAs to repress viral replication specifically. mouse IFIT1 inhibits replication of viruses naturally lacking or mutated to lack 2'O-methylation by directly binding and inhibiting translation of cap0-mRNAs. mouse IFIT1 selectively inhibits viruses that translate proteins from 'non-self' cap0-mRNAs, while the host protects itself via'self' cap1-structures on its mRNAs. human IFIT1 encodes a cap1-methyltransferase and PIV5 mRNAs are 2'O-methylated on their caps. other studies have implicated human IFIT1 in inhibition of hepatitis C virus (HCV), human papillomavirus (HPV) and influenza A virus (IAV) FIT1 proteins discriminate cap0- from cap1-mRNA methylation by inhibiting growth only when a cap1-methyltransferase is missing. we find that human and other IFIT1 proteins can inhibit replication of a virus that lacks functional cap1-methylation. findings thus resolve apparent mystery of IFIT1\u2019s altered antiviral discrimination mechanism in mouse and human. we formally tested for IFIT1 orthology between mouse and human. we first undertook detailed phylogenetic analyses of the IFIT genes found in several well-assembled mammalian genomes. human chromosome 10 contains a single locus that encodes all five intact IFIT genes. we found the IFIT locus organization is similar in many other mammalian genomes including africa green monkeys, rabbits, cats, ferrets, and armadillos. a single duplication of IFIT1 may have occurred early in mammalian evolution. the discordant phylogenetic signatures of IFIT1 and IFIT1B evolution could have two alternative explanations. the first is that species-specific duplication may have independently given rise to IFIT1 and IFIT1B genes in different genomes. resulting gene conversion would scramble the phylogenetic relatedness of the two genes without altering their genomic locations. the sequences of IFIT1 and IFIT1B genes in cats are 86% identical at the whole gene level. however, these two genes are 97% identical in the 5' ends of the genes (nucleotides 1\u2013948 in cat IFIT1) but only 63% identical in the 3' ends of the genes (Figure 2A). this dichotomy is apparent even if we restrict the analysis to just synonymous substitutions. all of these gene conversion events have a similar recurrent breakpoint approximately two-thirds of the way through the gene sequence (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1) that maps to a 'pivot' point between subdomains in the homologous IFIT5 structure. in all cases, the 5' ends of the IFIT1 genes are largely homogenized, whereas the 3' ends appear to be consistently diverging. a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of the 5' end of the IFIT gene alignment is shown in Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3. a figure showing revised gene names on the gene locus alignment is shown in Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4. recurrent gene conversion across several diverse mammalian species has utilized a similar recombination breakpoint. phylogenetic tree of the recombining region of mammalian IFIT genes. maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of the recombining region of mammalian IFIT genes using only the region 5' to the recombination breakpoint. both IFIT1 and IFIT1B genes form distinct monophyletic clades that diverge according to mammalian species evolution, similar to other IFIT genes. this phylogeny reflects the actual ancestry of IFIT1 and IFIT1B genes in mammals. recombination-aware phylogenetic approach thus reveals substantial changes in the IFIT gene repertoire even within this limited number of mammalian species. we assembled over 200 IFIT genes from 51 vertebrate species and conducted maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses. most placental mammals contain members of the IFIT1, 1B, 2, 3 and 5 gene families. X's indicate deletion or pseudogenization of either IFIT1 or IFIT1B genes from that lineage. predicted occurrences of gene conversion (red-around-blue circles) between IFIT1 and IFIT1B sequences based on discordance between phylogenetic trees generated from 3' or 5' regions. a portion of the maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of the non-recombining 5' region of vertebrate IFITs is shown as in Figure 3 supplement 2. a portion of the maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of the non-recombining 5' region of vertebrate IFITs is shown as in Figure 3 supplement 2. a phylogenetic tree of this non-recombining region of vertebrate IFITs shows that IFIT1 and IFIT1B genes cluster into distinct monophyletic clades. a phylogenetic tree created from just the 5' end of vertebrate IFITs reveals numerous instances of gene conversion. a phylogenetic tree created from just the 5' end of vertebrate IFITs reveals numerous instances of gene conversion. ged as expected based on primate phylogeny and that all primates encode an intact IFIT1. in total, we found numerous instances of IFIT gene birth, gene loss and gene recombination. most changes in the gene repertoire of IFITs across mammalian species are focused on IFIT1 and IFIT1B. we hypothesized that IFIT1 and IFIT1B proteins have distinct molecular discrimination properties. mouse IFIT1B binds and inhibits translation of cap0-mRNAs. mouse IFIT1B binds and inhibits translation of cap0-mRNAs. activity is blocked when mRNAs contain a cap1-structure. shown are 10-fold serial dilutions of yeast spotted on media in which indicated IFIT is either not expressed (Glucose) or expressed (Galactose) Rows marked with '-' indicate an empty vector control. we hypothesized that expression of mouse IFIT1B in budding yeast might inhibit yeast growth just as IFIT1B inhibits replication of viruses with cap0-mRNAs. introducing the human cap1-methyltransferase hCRMT1 to yeast would rescue yeast growth by blocking the activity of IFIT1B. we found that expression of human IFIT1 resulted in a potent inhibition of yeast growth. however, in contrast to mouse IFIT1B, we observed no rescue of human IFIT1-mediated growth inhibition upon overexpression of hCMTR1. as-yet-undefined 'non-self' molecular pattern is not relieved by a cap1-methyltransferase. in contrast to IFIT1B, IFIT1 inhibits yeast growth regardless of whether cap1-methyltransferase is present. human IFIT1 and mouse IFIT1B have evolved distinct molecular functions. resolution of IFIT1 and IFIT1B genes required considering only the non-recombining 3' end of the genes. chimeras between mouse IFIT1B and human IFIT1B were unable to recapitulate yeast growth inhibition. however, this result may be expected, as each of these proteins has diverged without gene conversion for >30 million years. IFIT1 and IFIT1B proteins are functionally distinct in their dependence on cap1-methyltransferase in our yeast assay. to test this hypothesis, we created cell lines that constitutively overexpress different IFIT1 or IFIT1B genes. we then tested whether either human IFIT1 or mouse IFIT1B can specifically inhibit replication of a virus lacking a functional cap1-methyltransferase. human IFIT1B lacks antiviral activity despite being expressed in these cell lines. most IFIT1B proteins (except for the putatively non-functional human IFIT1B) share cap0-mRNA recognition as a discriminant. human IFIT1 does not discriminate'self versus non-self' based on cap0-mRNA versus cap1-mRNA specificity. neither gibbon nor AGM IFIT1 was able to inhibit the cap0-mRNA expressing vaccinia virus (Figure 6D) mouse IFIT1B had no effect on virally-encoded GFP expression. viral titers were also unaffected by other IFIT1B genes. this inhibition activity was also conserved in other primate IFIT1 proteins. mouse IFIT1 is more similar at the sequence level to another human IFIT, the poorly characterized human IFIT1B, than to human IFIT1 (57% versus 53% pairwise amino acid identity). we first undertook detailed phylogenetic analyses of the IFIT gene locus from several mammalian genomes. the nomenclature for the IFIT genes marked with asterisks is as previously proposed. we suggest a revised nomenclature scheme for those genes in this report from Figure 2 onwards. the paralogs immediately adjacent to IFIT3 are named IFIT1B in sequence databases. the distal paralogs are named IFIT1 and IFIT1B in sequence databases. instead of two paralogs, mice have three IFIT1 paralogs, two of which are in the opposite orientation to IFIT2 and IFIT3. cat IFIT1B is more phylogenetically related to cat IFIT1 than to IFIT1B genes from other genomes. however, such a duplication pattern would require recurrent duplication of IFIT genes in many lineages into the same genetic location and orientation. resulting gene conversion would scramble the phylogenetic relatedness of the two genes without altering their genomic locations. a similar dichotomy is evident in a comparison between rabbit IFIT1 and IFIT1B and between armadillo IFIT1 and IFIT1B. a similar dichotomy is evident in a comparison between rabbit IFIT1 and IFIT1B and between armadillo IFIT1 and IFIT1B. middle rectangle represents a pairwise sequence alignment, with black vertical lines indicating differences between the two gene sequences. percent nucleotide identity for the whole gene comparison is shown above the alignment schematic, with the 5' end and 3' end percent identities shown below. the recombination breakpoint (red vertical arrow) between regions of high sequence identity and low dS (5' end) and low sequence identity and high dS (3' end) is similar across these distantly related species. phylogenetic tree of the recombining region of mammalian IFIT genes. phylogeny of mammalian IFITs with updated IFIT1 and IFIT1B gene names has been revised to correspond to the phylogenetic relatedness of genes shown in Figure 2C. both IFIT1 and IFIT1B genes form distinct monophyletic clades that diverge according to mammalian species evolution. all three mouse IFIT1 paralogs (previously named mouse IFIT1, IFIT1b and IFIT1c) and both rat paralogs (previously named rat IFIT1 and IFIT1b) unambiguously group within the IFIT1B gene family. recombination-aware phylogenetic approach thus reveals substantial changes in the IFIT gene repertoire even within this limited number of mammalian species. the human-like IFIT repertoire (IFIT1, 1B, 2, 3 and 5) was established when placental mammals diverged from non-placental mammals approximately 100\u2013200 mya. other vertebrates have undergone lineage-specific expansion of IFITs. phylogenetic tree of over 200 IFIT genes from 51 vertebrate species. bootstrap values greater than 80% are shown along the supported branch. an ancestral IFIT was duplicated multiple times early in mammalian evolution. IFIT1B genes by frameshift and nonsense mutations indicated by red-strikethroughs. subsequent analyses suggest that human IFIT1B also lacks activity, although it encodes an intact open reading frame. a phylogenetic tree of this non-recombining region of vertebrate IFITs shows that IFIT1 and IFIT1B genes cluster into distinct monophyletic clades. a phylogenetic tree created from just the 5' end of vertebrate IFITs reveals numerous instances of gene conversion. in primates, we found that IFIT1 and IFIT1B genes have diverged as expected based on primate phylogeny. we hypothesized that IFIT1 and IFIT1B proteins have distinct molecular discrimination properties. previous studies investigated mRNA cap requirements for IFIT1B-mediated growth inhibition have been carried out in context of a virus infection under interferon-induced conditions. yeast genetic assay recapitulates IFIT1B molecular specificity. proposed role of mouse IFIT1B in recognition and inhibition of mRNAs containing cap0-structures. FIT and hCMTR1 expression only induced upon grown on galactose-containing media. blots probed with anti-Flag antibody (for IFIT1B expression), anti-hCMTR1 (for cap1-methyltransferase expression) and anti-PGK1 (as a loading control). we hypothesized that introducing the human cap1-methyltransferase hCRMT1 to yeast would rescue yeast growth by blocking the activity of IFIT1B. the mouse IFIT1B-mediated growth inhibition of budding yeast is specifically due to the lack of a functional cap1-methyltransferase in yeast, accurately recapitulating the known antiviral molecular specificity of IFIT1B. we found that expression of human IFIT1 resulted in a potent inhibition of yeast growth (Figure 5A) however, in contrast to mouse IFIT1B, we observed no rescue of human IFIT1-mediated growth inhibition upon overexpression of hCMTR1. blots probed with anti-Flag antibody (for IFIT1 or IFIT1B expression), anti-hCMTR1 (for cap1-methyltransferase expression) and anti-PGK1 (as a loading control) the location of molecular weight markers are indicated on the right of the Western blots. cat IFIT1 and IFIT1B are 96% identical at the amino acid level in the N-terminus of the protein. the C-terminus is only 46% identical (Figure 5E) cat IFIT1 and IFIT1B gene families perform distinct molecular functions in the species in which they are found. expression of mouse IFIT1B can potently inhibit replication of a mutant vaccinia virus that lacks cap1-methyltransferase activity. this assay allowed us to test whether cap1-methyltransferase could enable a virus to block IFIT-mediated antiviral activity. cells expressing the indicated IFIT protein were infected with either wildtype or cap1-methlytransferase mutant (J3 K175A, right) vaccinia virus at an MOI of 0.01. Virus was harvested at the indicated time point and titered. Error bars represent standard deviation of three biological replicates. we expect that all cap1-mRNA expressing viruses would be resistant to IFIT1B restriction. we infected cell lines expressing either human IFIT1 or mouse IFIT1B with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a virus known to express mRNAs with a cap1-structure. cell lines were infected with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) encoding a virally-encoded GFP protein at an MOI of 0.01. after 12 hr, cells were visualized for expression of the virally-encoded virus. despite being among the most highly expressed interferon-stimulated genes, the function of the IFIT antiviral genes is still incompletely understood. previously, several IFITs, including mouse IFIT1B (previously mouse IFIT1) and human IFIT1 were shown to inhibit protein synthesis. this finding is consistent with mRNA translation control being a major axis of regulation of viral replication. changes in IFIT gene composition may be expected to affect the range of viruses that can be inhibited by IFITs in different mammalian genomes. based on their long divergence, we predicted that only IFIT1B proteins distinguish'self from non-self' mRNAs by recognizing an unmethylated (cap0-) mRNA structure. we find that IFIT1B has been deleted or pseudogenized at least seven times in mammalian evolution. humans and most other mammalian species (excluding rodents) do, however, have an intact member of the IFIT1 gene family. we now show that IFIT1 has evolved a molecular specificity that differs from IFIT1B. we favor a model in which IFIT1 recognizes a distinct'self versus non-self' pattern on mRNA to selectively inhibit viral replication. a previous proposal suggested that human IFIT1 antiviral activity resulted from direct binding and sequestration of 5' triphosphate ends of viral replication intermediates, thus interfering with replication rather than directly inhibiting translation. the methylation state of the first transcribed nucleotide (cap0-structure versus cap1-structure) is not the determinant of IFIT1 specificity. other chemical modifications near the cap may allow IFIT1 to distinguish'self' from 'non-self' to selectivity inhibit viral replication. the breakpoint occurs just outside of the homooligomerization domain in the structure of IFIT2. we hypothesize that duplication or loss of different IFIT genes might directly influence the ability of a particular host species to defend against specific viral pathogens. the loss of IFIT1B function in many rodents might leave them more susceptible to infection by viruses inhibited by IFIT1. we predict that evolution of IFIT genes across mammals will have important consequences for species-specific antiviral immunity. the dynamic evolution of IFIT genes across mammals will have important consequences for species-specific antiviral immunity. pairwise percent identity calculations and graphical representations were made using Geneious. phylogenetic trees were visualized using FigTree (https://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/). s were used as templates to amplify the entire region spanning the Gal promoter to the Leu2 gene using primers described in Supplementary file 2. resulting PCR products were transformed into strain BY4741 and yeast were selected on media lacking leucine (SC -leu/-his GLU) yeast with integrated galactose-inducible methyltransferases were subsequently transformed with IFIT genes as described above. the BSC40 cells have been routinely screened for mycoplasma infections. they are not on the list of commonly misidentified cell lines maintained by the international cell line Authentication Committee. all cell lines were assayed within the first 20 passages. mouse M2 anti-Flag (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO; F1804), rabbit anti-hCMTR1 (Sigma-Aldrich; HPA029979), mouse anti-PGK1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA; 459250), and rat anti-tubulin (Millipore, Temecula, CA; CBL270). phylogenetic analyses Mammalian IFIT genes were identified in genomes of the indicated species using human IFIT protein sequences. the entire protein-encoding sequence except for the N-terminal methionine is encoded on a single exon. in human IFIT genes, the entire protein-encoding sequence except for the N-terminal methionine is encoded on a single exon. IFIT genes with an N-terminal 3xFlag tag were cloned downstream of the Gal1-10 promoter in the Cen-based plasmid, p413, using primers described in Supplementary file 2. yeast plating assays were performed on selective media with either 2% glucose (for uninduced controls) or 2% galactose (for induction of IFIT and methyltransferase genes) a single yeast colony was picked from a freshly streaked plate of transformed yeast and grown overnight at 30 degrees in liquid media (SC -his GLU or SC -his/-leu GLU) Vaccinia virus strain WR wildtype or cap1-methyltransferase mutant (J3 K175R) was a generous gift of R. Condit (Latner et al., 1999). Vaccinia virus was harvested at the indicated time post-infection by freeze/thaw disruption of cells.
