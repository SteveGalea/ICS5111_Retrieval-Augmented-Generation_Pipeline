{"summary": "human hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is one of the most common viral infections and the leading cause of liver diseases worldwide. orthohepadnaviruses are host specific to each of these groups, suggesting an ancient virus-host association (2). orthohepadnaviruses have been identified in rodents, primates, and bats. viruses indicate few cross-species transmissions between distant primates. in bats, the occurrence of interspecies circulation between divergent species is contrasted by a virus-host association in the Rhinolophidae and Hipposideridae families. TBHBV was able to infect human primary hepatocytes using human NTCP (9) pathogenic viruses and their host receptors can coevolve under a regime of evolutionary \u201carms races\u201d where both partners reciprocally change over time for survival (25, 29) pathogenic viruses and their host receptors can coevolve under a regime of evolutionary \u201carms races\u201d where both partners reciprocally change over time for survival (25, 29) in bat NTCP, the genetic fingerprints are external to the presumed HBV-binding motifs. this may reflect either pathogenic orthohepadnaviruses bind to other surfaces in bat NTCP or that orthohepadnaviruses have not been a selective pressure. NTCP adaptation in bats results from another selective pressure (e.g., metabolism or diet) NTCP sequences were publicly available for only nine bat species, representing 5/19 bat families, which is too limited for robust evolutionary analyses. Species from 10 families of 19 were sampled, allowing us to significantly increase our sampling of NTCPs from bats. our samples now span 64 million years of bat divergence (41, 42) in new world monkeys, orthohepadnaviruses have been reported from the woolly monkey and the capuchin monkey. but NTCP sequences are not available for these species. pairwise amino acid identities of NTCP and GPC5 protein sequences revealed that they are mostly conserved in primates, rodents, and bats. pathogenic HBVs may have exerted a higher selective pressure on the NTCP protein than on GPC5. positive selection analyses of primate, rodent, and bat NTCP/SLC10A1 and GPC5 as well as of the orthohepadnavirus preS1 region. positive selection in the primate NTCP/SLC10A1 gene was assessed for different data sets. the whole primate data set (n = 27), the simian primate data set (excluding the prosimians; n = 24) and the primate data set excluding hominoid species (n = 21). evolutionary analyses were also carried out on rodents (18 species) 157, 335 6, 9, 84, 157, 158, 303, 335, 341 142, 157, 196, 335 157, 158, 158, 175, 335 157, 158, 303, 335 157, 158, 303, 335 84, 157, 335 84, 157, 335 84, 157, 335 84, 157, 161, 335 6, 84, 157, 158 codon numbering is based on the human NTCP sequence as a reference. in primates, four codons (84, 157, 158, and 335) were found under positive selection. these sites correlate with amino acids that directly interact with the preS1 domain of the large envelope protein of HBV. primate NTCP has evolved under positive selection, with positively selected sites mapping to the HBV-binding region. a diagram representing the predicted domains of NTCP is shown (89), and the HBV-binding interfaces are highlighted in yellow. specific codons found to be evolving under positive selection. the four positively selected codons in primate NTCP have experienced recurrent selection for mutations that replace the encoded amino acids. these positions are therefore highly variable at the protein level. however, the HBV-binding interfaces of NTCP are highly conserved within the hominoids. orthohepadnaviruses have circulated in primates during hominoid diversification. this model implies that orthohepadnaviruses have been associated with primates much earlier, at least prior to the diversification of the simian primates. this model suggests that orthohepadnaviruses have circulated in primates. codon 84 was found to be under significant positive selection. it remains unclear whether all orthohepadnaviruses use NTCP as a cellular receptor. previous studies have shown that woodchuck NTCP supports human HBV infection. codons shown with stars are those identified as being under positive selection by at least three methods. codons shown with stars are those identified as being under positive selection by at least three methods. the codons shown with stars are those identified as being under positive selection by at least three methods. the newly sequenced species are highlighted in boldface type. codon numbering is based on the human NTCP sequence as a reference. the study of pathogenic virus-host evolutionary interactions has the power to predict and identify the sites of interaction. positively selected codons identified in bat NTCP could represent the binding surfaces of bat orthohepadnaviruses. if so, the signatures of rapid evolution in NTCP may be reminiscent of past genetic conflicts with orthohepadnaviruses during bat evolution. a third nonexclusive hypothesis is that the observed genetic fingerprints reflect adaptive changes related to bat metabolism. NTCP has a key role in mammalian enterohepatic circulation, digestion, and metabolic regulation (75) only polymorphic sites were retained for the analysis. the graphs were obtained with the ADEGRAPHICS package available in R (92). a combination of coevolution and host switches has been described in mammalian orthohepadnaviruses (67, 77), the involved molecular factors/barriers are yet to be determined. the adaptive changes in NTCP may contribute to the current narrow host range of orthohepadnaviruses. the conserved HBV-binding regions in hominoid NTCP may allow viral interspecies circulation. hepadnaviruses have been reported in only three rodent species. cross-species transmissions between highly divergent species seem more recurrent. NTCP may be a weak genetic constraint in bats, which could increase transmission of orthohepadnaviruses. tBLASTn searches of the nucleotide databases from GenBank (79) using human, mouse, and little brown bat NTCP and GPC5 sequences as queries. in total, 27 NTCP and 20 GPC5 sequences from hominoids, Old World monkeys, New World monkeys, and prosimians were obtained. bats were captured using harp traps at the entrance of caves or mist nests hoisted on the forest floor. bats were removed carefully from nests or harp traps at the entrance of caves or mist nests. PCRs were carried out in a total volume of 25 l containing 1 reaction buffer (DreamTaq DNA polymerase; Thermo Fisher Scientific), 0.2 mM each deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP), 0.2 M each primer, 1 U of Taq polymerase (DreamTaq DNA polymerase; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and approximately 10 ng of extracted genomic DNA. NTCP/SLC10A1 gene from the extracted gDNA. primers targeting SLC10A1 intronic regions were designed to amplify and sequence each of the five exons. we used the Qiagen Dream Taq kit under conditions for amplification. a phylogenetic tree of NTCP and GPC5 orthologous sequences was constructed using the maximum likelihood method implemented in the ATGC-PhyML Web server (86) the following approach was used for primate, rodent, and bat data sets. codeml allows both gene- and site-specific detection of positive selection by comparing constrained models that disallow positive selection (models M1 and M7; dN/dS ratio of 1) to unconstrained models allowing for positive selection (M2 and M8). the percentage of sites exhibiting a significant signal of positive selection was estimated. the determinants of interaction with NTCP are located in the HBV preS1 domain of the large envelope protein. we thus performed positive-selection analyses on a codon sequence alignment of the preS1 domain, using models M1 versus M2 and M7 versus M8 of Codeml. human NTCP as well as the mouse and little brown bat NTCP protein sequences were used as queries for the SWISS-MODEL tool (87, 88) the 3D model represents amino acids 28 to 308 for primate, rodent, and bat NTCP proteins. the protein structure was edited with Swiss PDB viewer (90). principal-coordinate analysis was obtained by translating the codon alignment used for positive-selection analyses. NTCP and GPC5 sequences from 18 rodent species were obtained. for bats, NTCP and GPC5 sequences were publicly available for nine and seven species. bats were captured using harp traps at the entrance of caves or mist nests hoisted on the forest floor and in the tree canopy. captured bats were removed carefully from nests or harp traps. PCRs were carried out in a total volume of 25 l containing 1 reaction buffer (DreamTaq DNA polymerase; Thermo Fisher Scientific), 0.2 mM each deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP), 0.2 M each primer, 1 U of Taq polymerase. we used the Qiagen Dream Taq kit under conditions for amplification presented in Tables S3 and S4 at https://figshare.com/articles/S3_Table_Primer_pairs_used_for_NTCP_amplification_of_each_species_/7321109. gel purification was performed when necessary using the NucleoSpin gel and PCR clean-up kit from Macherey-Nagel. a phylogenetic tree of NTCP and GPC5 orthologous sequences was constructed using the maximum likelihood method implemented in the ATGC-PhyML Web server (86) a phylogenetic tree of NTCP and GPC5 orthologous sequences was constructed using the bootstrap method. constrained models disallow positive selection (models M1 and M7; dN/dS ratio of 1) to unconstrained models allowing for positive selection (M2 and M8). the phylogenetic tree generated by this model was then used to run the other models under the following parameters: codon frequencies of F61 and F3*4. NTCP are located in the HBV preS1 domain of the large envelope protein. we therefore performed positive-selection analyses on a codon sequence alignment of the preS1 domain, using models M1 versus M2 and M7 versus M8 of Codeml. -coordinate analysis (PCoA) was obtained by translating the codon alignment used for positive-selection analyses using MEGA v.7 (82). the polymorphic sites were extracted from the protein alignment."}
