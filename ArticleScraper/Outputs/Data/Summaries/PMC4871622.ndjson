{"summary": "literature, reviews, editorials, cross-sectional studies, theoretical models and publications were excluded. standardized outcome measures were computed as i) the relative risk reduction (RRR) of AIV-detection in LPMs and ii) incidence rate ratios of H7N9-incidence in humans. human influenza viruses cause seasonal influenza, a globally widespread respiratory illness giving rise to 3\u20135 million cases of severe illness every year. most strains of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) do not pose a risk to human health. china's LPMs implemented monthly [19] or bimonthly [20] rest days and an overnight poultry storage ban [21]. Similarly, LPM-systems in the north-eastern USA have introduced regular depopulation and disinfection of all markets in 2002 [22], [23], [24]. standardized outcome measures were computed as i) relative risk reduction (RRR) of AIV-detection in LPMs and ii) incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of H7N9-incidence in humans. raw data was retrieved from supplementary materials. literature search was conducted on 25 July 2015. 2.2. Inclusion criteria Settings: live poultry markets worldwide; no time restrictions; Interventions: temporary LPM closure, periodic rest days combined with depopulation and disinfection of the markets. Outcomes: AIV-detection rates in birds and/or the market environment or influenza incidence in humans. /total nr. of positive samples tested before the intervention Relative risk (RR): RR = P post / P pre Relative risk reduction (RR) for studies with AIV-prevalence as an outcome: RRR = 1 RR The 95% confidence intervals for the RRR were calculated as 1 minus the confidence limits of the relative risk. cal swabs were sampled from different bird species within a 6-day window prior and after the monthly intervention. each month, the risk of H9N2-isolation was significantly reduced by 87\u2013100% after the intervention. however, isolation rates reached again pre-intervention values within a month. samples were collected during the time period spanning one month before and two months after the LPM closure. overall AIV-prevalence was significantly decreased in environmental (2 = 6.25; p-value = 0.012), but not animal specimens [26]. in a similar study in Guangdong, 15% (112/755) of samples were H7N9-positive by RT-PCR one week before a 14 day LPM closure period. IV-detection was always significantly reduced after LPM closure and disinfection, with RRRs ranging between 0.79 and 0.98 (p-values 0.0001). long-term risk reduction following the implementation of a regular LPM rest day was less evident. rest days in retail LPMs (rLPM) induced a significant risk reduction of AIV-detection from environmental specimens. the introduction of a monthly rest day in Hong Kong's markets did not elicit a significant sustained and highly significant risk reduction of H9N2-isolation. 2.4% (5/209) 0.30 ( 1.56; 0.81) Bird: 2.7% (3/113) Bird: 1.8% (5/275) 0.32 ( 1.82; 0.83) Lau et al.
