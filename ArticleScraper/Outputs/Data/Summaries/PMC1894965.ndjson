{"summary": "the population of Ontario was grouped into the Greater Toronto Area (N = 2.9 million) and the rest of Ontario (N = 9.3 million) based on the level of restrictions on delivery of clinical services during the SARS outbreak. the rate ratio for all-cause mortality during the SARS outbreak was 0.99 compared to 2002 and 0.96 compared to 2001. the cancellation of all non-emergency surgical services, an almost complete curtailment of inter-hospital patient transfers, and the postponement of most hospital-based outpatient clinics. the effect of these measures on access to health care was underscored by media reports of inappropriate delays for cancer therapy and the inability to perform urgent surgeries. health care utilization in the Greater Toronto Area decreased significantly. outpatient procedures such as breast biopsies, chemotherapy infusions, and vasectomies decreased by about 40%. outpatient physician visits decreased by 16% overall, and emergency department visits decreased by 25%. data obtained from each death certificate included the decedent's date of birth, sex, place of death, and date of death. we subtracted the 44 deaths in Ontario due to SARS from the death certificate database. time-series analysis consists of several techniques for modeling autocorrelation. the method takes into account both time trends and seasonal fluctuations within timeseries data. the 95% confidence intervals for predicted mortality rates were generated using this method. inpatient procedures such as abdominal aortic aneurysm repairs, cholecystectomies, and joint replacement surgeries decreased by about 40%. outpatient diagnostic tests such as MRI and CT scans decreased by 34\u201351% overall. outpatient physician visits decreased by 16% overall, and emergency department visits decreased by 25%. the beginning of the 2003 SARS outbreak occurred 12 weeks after the beginning of the year. we compared mortality rates for the 12-week period before the beginning of the outbreak, the outbreak period, and the 12-week period after the end of the outbreak. rates were expressed as deaths per week per 100,000 population. all statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 8.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, N.C.) During the period of the SARS outbreak between March 27 and July 2, 2003, there were 8,619 deaths in the Greater Toronto Area and 14,601 deaths in the rest of Ontario. the corresponding values were 8,350 and 14,677 in the year 2002. the rate ratio for overall population mortality in the rest of Ontario during the SARS outbreak was 0.97 [95% CI 0.91\u20131.02] when compared to 2002 and 0.97 [95% CI 0.92\u20131.02] when compared to 2001. the analysis of mortality rates among people aged 65 years and over also found no statistically significant changes. adjusted mortality rate ratios compare mortality rates for periods in 2003 before, during, and after the SARS outbreak to the corresponding time periods in 2002 and 2001. the rate ratio for overall population mortality in the Greater Toronto Area was 0.99 [95% CI 0.93\u20131.06] when mortality during the SARS outbreak in 2003 was compared to the corresponding time period in 2001. 2002 1.06 (0.97 \u2013 1.17) 0.99 (0.92 \u2013 1.07) 0.98 (0.90 \u2013 1.07) Rest of Ontario All ages Compared to 2001 1.07 (1.01 \u2013 1.14) 0.97 (0.91 \u2013 1.02) 0.97 (0.91 \u2013 1.03) Age 65 and over. a study conducted in china found that the proportion of positive samples for influenza and respiratory viruses other than SARS decreased significantly during the ARS outbreak. the study was designed to detect increases in short-term mortality that would constitute an immediate health challenge, but not longer-term effects. the study focused on mortality, an outcome that may have been affected by SARS-related infection control measures. julian zelizer: future studies are needed to assess effects of extraordinary infection control measures on morbidity. he says a coordinated response to severe infectious disease outbreaks requires an approach that balances an infection control mandate with the need to preserve access to essential health services. zelizer: future infectious disease outbreaks, such as avian influenza, could limit access to health care resources to a much greater extent than did the SARS outbreak. the authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care. the views expressed in this publication are the views of the authors."}
