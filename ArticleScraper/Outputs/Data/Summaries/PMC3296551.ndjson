{"summary": "despite intensive efforts, no effective vaccine has been developed against ALV because of mutations that lead to resistant forms. there is a dire need to develop antiviral agents for the treatment of ALV infections and RNA interference (RNAi) is considered an effective antiviral strategy. RNA interference (RNAi) is a simple and effective tool for silencing target genes. the main nucleic acid molecules that induce gene silencing are small interfering RNA (siRNA) and microRNA (miRNA), where the siRNAs mediate specific mRNA degradation. miRNA inhibits specific mRNA at the translational level. the intrinsic drawbacks of siRNA methodology have been revealed. if the virus mutates, siRNA will produce off-target effects. the unique biogenesis and mechanism of action of miRNA do reduce the likelihood of these problems. cells The SD strains of ALV-J were isolated from poultry in Shandong, china. they were stored at the Harbin Veterinary Research Institute (Harbin, China) the DF-1 cell lines were provided by Zhigao Bu at the Harbin Veterinary Research Institute. recombinant plasmids were inserted into the linearized expression vector, pcDNA6.2-GW/EmGFP-miR (5 ng/L), to construct recombinant plasmids containing the target miRNAs, designated mi-gag1318, mi-gag1365, mi-gag1623, mi-gag1971. miRNA sequence of the pol gene was digested with SalI and BglI. mi-g1318-e1384 and mi-p2516-e1384 plasmids were constructed in the same way. positive clones were verified by digestion with XhoI and SalI. transfected cells were inoculated with 100 50% tissue culture infectious doses of ALV-J. the culture medium was obtained 72 h after viral infection. the inhibition effect was detected by an indirect immunofluorescence assay. the number of fluorescent cells per well was counted using a fluorescence microscope. the toxic potency of the virus was determined to be 105.2 TCID50/mL. cells were then washed with PBST five times, for 10 min each. radish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse secondary antibody was added and cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 45 min. the cells were stained with 3,3' diaminobenzidine (DAB, 6 mg, 10 mL TBS, 0.1 mL 3% H2O2) and then scanned using the gel imaging system AlphaImager HP. RNA was extracted from viruses and cells 72 h after the infection of DF-1 cells with ALV-J using Trizol. RNA concentration and purity was determined by measuring optical density (OD260/OD280 ratios) DF-1 cell lines were provided by Zhigao Bu at the Harbin Veterinary Research Institute (Harbin, China), a Key State Laboratory. linearized the pcDNA6.2-GW/EmGFP-miR eukaryotic expression vector, Escherichia coli TOP10 cells and the Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA). Ligase and reverse transcriptase were purchased from Ta miR (5 ng/L), to construct recombinant plasmids containing target miRNAs, designated mi-gag1318, mi-gag1365, mi-gag1623, mi-gag1971. all recombinant plasmids have been sequenced to confirm the sequences inserted. tandem plasmid consisting of mi-gag1318 and mi-pol2516 was digested with SalI and BglI. mi-g1318-e1384 and mi-p2516-e1384 plasmids were constructed in the same way. positive clones were verified by double digestion with XhoI and SalI and sequencing. mi-gag1365, mi-gag1623, mi-gag1971. all recombinant plasmids have been sequenced to confirm the sequences inserted. the miRNA sequence of the pol gene (NC-015116 pol) was digested. tandem plasmid consisting of mi-gag1318, mi-pol2516 and mi-pol2516 was designated mi-g1318-p2516-e1384. positive clones were verified by double digestion with XhoI and SalI and sequencing. transfected cells were inoculated with 100 50% tissue culture infectious doses (TCID50) of ALV-J. the culture medium was obtained 72 h after viral infection. the inhibitory effect was detected by an indirect immunofluorescence assay. the toxic potency of the virus was determined to be 105.2 TCID50/mL. cells were treated with the fluorescent secondary antibody, rhodamine-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG/TRITC. the results were photographed using a fluorescence microscopy. two pairs of target genes and the -actin gene were amplified by PCR using the SD cDNA as a template. cDNAs amplified using the gag, ALV-specific, and -actin primers were cloned into vector pMD-18-T. RNA concentration and purity was determined by measuring optical density (OD) at wavelengths of 260 and 280 nm using a standard spectrophotometer. the OD260/OD280 ratios were more than 1.8 for all samples. 16-e1384 and mi-g1318-p2516-e1384 significantly inhibited the fluorescence intensity compared with the negative control group. however, no significant differences were detected among other groups compared with the negative control group and the null vector group. transfection of tandem plasmids into DF-1 cells significantly decreased expression of the ALV-J envelope glycoprotein. there were no significant differences determined between the remaining groups and the negative control and null vector groups. the rate of inhibition was highest with plasmid mi-g1318-p2516-e1384 (91.2%) p-values mi-gag1318 1.05 0.11 3.21 0.12 0.327 77.3* 0.01 mi-gag 1365 1.10 0.12 3.14 0.15 0.3350 65.0* 0.02 mi-gag 1623 2.81 0.11 3.49 0.16 0.805 19.5 0.06 mi-gag 1971 3.12 0.17 3.85 0. vector control 3.18 0.15 1.030 0 0 Vector control 3.18 0.12 3.25 0.10 0.987 0 0 Statistically significant differences from the Negative control are indicated by*(P0.05) recombinant plasmids, mi-g1318 and mi-gag1365, significantly reduced the fluorescence intensity.
