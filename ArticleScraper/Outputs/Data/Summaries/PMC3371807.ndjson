{"summary": "questionnaire was designed by emergency department experts after panel discussions. data collected included accreditation of the hospitals, the average monthly volume of emergency department patients from March to May 2003, types of PPE supplied, types of ICMs implemented, and timing and origin of instruction. the timing of complete PPE implementation or having ICMs completely in place was classified into 2 stages. the difficulty of implementing or instituting ICMs was rated on a scale from 1 (mildly difficult) to 5 (very effective). the effectiveness of implementing or instituting ICMs was rated on a scale from 1 (less effective) to 5 (very effective). the average monthly volume of emergency department patients in level A hospitals was 6,200 (range 3,429\u201311,080) and 3,828 (range 1,864\u20135,770) in level B hospitals were significantly larger than the average number of patients in level C hospitals (average 2,246, range 729\u20133,236) no significant differences in emergency department volume were found between public and private hospitals. the number in parentheses is the percentage of the total EDs in a particular hospital level or type. level A emergency departments used high grade PPE (P100/N100/FFP3) more often than emergency departments at level B and C hospitals. the instructions to use PPE originated from emergency department managers in 60% of level A, 46% of level B, and 23% of level C hospitals. the order to implement ICMs came from hospital managers in 33% of level A, 50% of level B, and 62% of level C hospitals. infection control measures (ICM) Hospital level Hospital type A (%), n = 15 B (%), n = 28 C (%), n = 57 p value Public (%), n = 30 Private (%), n = 70 p value Basic ICM Entrance body temperature screen 15 (100) 28 (100) 57 (100) - 30 (100) 70 (100) 0.654 9 (30) 14 (20) 0.276 *ED, emergency department; SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome. Table 5 shows the rating scales and correlations of difficulty and effectiveness of ICMs in emergency departments. the effectiveness of additional ICMs decreased as difficulty of implementation increased. significant negative correlations were seen between perceived difficulty and effectiveness of implemented ICMs. emergency department workers may have become infected even without contact with a hospitalized SARS patient. a similar phenomenon was reported at hospitals in cities with a high population density. a similar phenomenon was reported at hospitals in cities with a high population density. small hospitals were more likely than larger hospitals to restrict patients from being transferred in than to transfer out suspected cases-patients during the epidemic. lack of isolation rooms became the key reason for transferring patients out and restricting the transfer of patients in. some hospitals did not even begin to consider how to implement these measures until they were directly facing the SARS epidemic. some hospitals did not even begin to consider how to implement these measures until they were directly facing the SARS epidemic. the first priority for hospital managers is to prevent a hospital outbreak. a centralized system for suspected patients may be considered as a strategy to reduce the severity and extent of an epidemic. the response rate of the present study was low, so results may have been affected by nonresponse bias. a similar phenomenon was reported at hospitals in cities with a high population density. fever patients tended to visit larger hospitals in the belief they would be able to see a specialist who could identify the fever source. preventing outbreaks at larger hospitals during an emerging disease is essential. smaller hospitals were more likely than larger hospitals to restrict patients from being transferred in than to transfer out suspected cases-patients during the epidemic. lack of isolation rooms became the key reason for transferring patients out and restricting the transfer of patients in. some hospitals did not even begin to consider how to implement these measures until they were directly facing the SARS epidemic. the reimbursement for private hospitals comes from the Bureau of national health insurance, depending on what services are provided. a centralized system for suspected patients may be considered as a strategy to reduce the severity and extent of an epidemic. the response rate of the present study was low, so results may have been affected by nonresponse bias. the degree of variability among emergency departments may have been underestimated."}
