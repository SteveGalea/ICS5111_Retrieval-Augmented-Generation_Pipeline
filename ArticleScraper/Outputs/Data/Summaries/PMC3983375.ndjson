{"summary": "no anticoronaviral regimens have been developed for the treatment of SARS-CoV or any other human coronaviruses (HCoV) infection. reemergence of SARS-CoV or other virulent human coronaviruses poses a continuing threat. a powerful reminder of this, as well as the fatal repercussions of the interspecies transmission potential of CoVs, was brought to the forefront in September 2012 by the emergence of a new SARS- a total of 6 human coronaviruses are known, of which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are recognized as highly pathogenic with the potential for human-to-human transmission. without an efficacious antiviral agent or vaccine, the prevention of current and emerging coronaviruses continues to rely strongly on public health measures. synthesis and biological evaluation of inhibitors 24(14) and 15g(15) and their X-ray structures in complex with SARS-CoV PLpro have been previously described. the chiral center for the nearly equipotent isomers derived from hit 2 is indicated with an asterisk. structures of PLpro\u201324 and PLpro\u201315g complexes revealed several hydrophobic interactions resultant of the highly hydrophobic naphthyl ring and few hydrogen bonds. 13a,14 Specifically, there is a highly mobile -turn/loop (Gly267-Gly272) adjacent to the active site that closes upon inhibitor binding. compound 15g requires a different and slightly more opened conformation to accommodate the longer piperidine-4-carboxamide scaffold and the improved resolution of the PLpro\u20133k and PLpro\u20133j X-ray structures revealed novel factors accounting for the observed high binding affinities of the piperidine-containing compounds. we demonstrate the effective inhibition of PLP2 from HCoV-NL63, a potentially fatal pathogen in children and elderly. the appropriate nitriles 8a,c were treated with 1-naphthyl Grignard reagent. the intermediary imines were hydrolyzed to the ketones 9a,c. the ketones were then reduced by the action of LAH to the alcohols 10a,c. the displacement route used in Schemes 1 and 2 was not successful with the more hindered phenyl analogue 1b. the displacement route used in Schemes 1 and 2 was not successful with the more hindered phenyl analogue 1d. the starting (R)-1-(1-(naphthalen-1-yl)ethyl)piperidine-4-carboxylic acid 25 was prepared according to the method of Ghosh et al.15 Coupling of the acid to various arylmethylamines and arylethylamines was effected either by EDCI in presence of DIEA or by uronium-based coupling reagent HATU. conformationally restricted analogue 7 was prepared as outlined in Scheme 6. amide coupling with 3-fluorobenzylamine, EDCI, HOBt, and DIEA led to the production of the target analogue 7. Compound 15g is a competitive inhibitor of SARS-CoV PLpro. it is composed of the central piperidine-4-carboxamide core decorated with 1-naphthalenylethyl and 1,3-benzodioxolylmethyl substituents. previous SAR has established the preference for the 1-naphthyl over the 2-naphthyl substitution pattern. the potential entropic gain by displacing the water molecules with larger R1 groups is not achieved likely because of a larger enthalpic penalty of breaking the H-bonds formed between these water molecules. this pocket is unlikely to provide any extra ligand-binding sites or room for larger substituents. a 10-fold stereopreference was observed for (S)-methoxymethyl 2e (IC50 = 1.9 0.1 M), compared to epimeric 2d (IC50 = 18.0 1.9 M), which could be indicative of a steric clash with SARS-CoV PLpro. benzyl group were limited to m- and p-methoxy analogues, which were as potent as the lead benzodioxolane analogue, 15g. in the X-ray structure of the SARS-CoV PLpro\u201315g complex, one of the 1,3-dioxolane oxygens is within 3 of the Gln270 side chain amide nitrogen, suggesting the potential for forming an H-bond. however, because a reversal of the amide direction to the acetamido group resulted in significantly differing activity levels for para and meta positional isomers 3d (IC50 = 5.7 0.5 M) and 3e (IC50 = 0.39 0.01 M), respectively. corresponding pair of chloro derivatives 3g (IC50 = 27.2 4.1 M) and 3h (IC50 = 0.58 0.01 M), with the halogen tolerated only at the para position. the monosubstitution at the meta position with the smallest and yet the most electron-withdrawing fluoro group resulted in the most potent SARS-CoV PLpro inhibitor identified thus far. the bioisosteres of naphthalene and benzene (quinoline and pyridine, respectively) were exploited by synthesizing corresponding derivatives. mutant enzymes (Gln270Ala, Gln270Asp, and Gln270Glu) observed no differences in the IC50 values within experimental error, indicating that no significant interaction is involved. analysis of the active site for other potential hydrogen-bonding residues produced no obvious candidates. tricyclic analogue 7 was prepared as a conformationally restricted analogue of our most potent inhibitor 3k. it was designed to lock the conformation of the bond joining C-1 of the naphthyl ring to the piperidinylethyl group. this modification led to a significant loss of activity (IC50 = 5.1 0.5 M) PLpro\u20133k and PLpro\u20133j complexes crystallized in space group C2. both complexes contained two monomers per asymmetric unit. data collection and refinement statistics. strong (>3) residual electron density was observed in Fo \u2013 Fc maps for both 3k and 3j in the active sites of each monomer. both 3k and 3j bind to the SARS-CoV PLpro active site in the same orientation. compounds 24 and 15g bind adjacent to the active site at the enzyme S3\u2013S4 subsites14,15. Upon inhibitor binding, the -turn/loop (Gly267-Gly272) adopts a closed conformation via an induced-fit mechanism to interact with the inhibitors. this enables the formation of a 3 H-bond between the backbone carbonyl of Tyr269 and the carboxyamide nitrogen of the inhibitors. the presence of these water molecules increases the polarity and decreases the effective size of the otherwise larger and mostly hydrophobic cavity. this explains our observed SAR with hydrophobic or polar extensions at the (R)-methyl (position R1 in Table 1) whereby the larger groups were detrimental to binding affinity. this suggests that the potential entropic gain in binding energy by displacement of the water molecules cannot be achieved by incorporation of larger or polar substituents. the development of an enzyme inhibitor with broad-spectrum specificity is an attractive approach for the treatment of infections caused by current and future-emerging human coronaviruses. however, it is crucial to maintain high inhibitory potency without cross-reactivity of critical homologues, the cellular deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) all the analogues in Tables 1 and 2 were counterscreened against the viral orthologue PLP2 enzyme from the human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), a member of the -coronaviruses. HCoV-NL63 is one of the causative agents of croup in children. compound 3k exhibits lower topological polar surface area (tPSA = 32.2 2) relative to the initial inhibitor 15g. compound 3k along with seven of the most potent analogues and two quinolone derivatives were subject to antiviral assays using our well-established method and BSL-3 protocols. EC50 = 5.4 0.6 M compared to 15g. the lead compound 15g proved to be exceedingly unstable. this was not entirely unexpected because of the presence of the 3,4-methylenedioxy moiety. me P450s.22,23 surprisingly, the much more electron-poor 3-fluorobenzylamide 3k was still metabolized rapidly, suggesting that most of the metabolism is occurring distal to the benzylamide. the less lipophilic bis(amide) 3e and methoxypyridine 5c were significantly more stable, with 20% and 30% parent drug remaining after 15 min, respectively. the appropriate nitriles 8a,c were treated with 1-naphthyl Grignard reagent. the intermediary imines were hydrolyzed to the ketones 9a,c. the ketones were then reduced by the action of LAH to the alcohols 10a,c. a similar displacement strategy was employed to obtain hydroxyl analogue 1b (Scheme 2). the primary alcohol was selectively protected as the tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBS) ether to give 14. amine 20 was then condensed with the bis-aldehyde derived from dimethyl 2,2-bis(1,3-dioxolan-2-yl)methyl)malonate to give the dihydropyridine dimethyl ester 21. the diester was converted into the monoester 23 by the Krapcho method and was then hydrolyzed to the acid. the shorter ethyl isonipecotate displacement route used in Schemes 1, 2 and 5 was not successful with the mesylate derived from reduction/mesylation of 29, presumably because of excessive steric hindrance. iPrOH, reflux, 44 h; dimethyl 2,2-bis(1,3-dioxolan-2-yl)methyl)malonate, HCl/THF; c) 30, NaHCO3, rt, 72 h; f) aq LiOH, THF/MeOH, rt; g) 3-fluorobenzylamine, EDCI, HOBt, DIEA, rt, 16 h; the first set of analogues explores the incorporation of larger or polar substituents (1a, -Me; 1b, -OH; 1c, -OMe; 1d, -Ph) at the methyl group (position R1 in Table 1).

PLpro\u201315g, PLpro\u20133k, and PLpro\u20133j complexes show a near perfect overlap of the 1-naphthyl rings. there is a 1 difference in the position of the carboxamide nitrogen of 15g. this causes a slight tilt on the orientations of the benzene rings to allow for the accommodation of the different benzene substituents. we can detect no significant inhibition of the human DUBs or cysteine protease enzymes tested above 20% at 31 M. this indicates that these PLpro inhibitors are selective and are unlikely to have significant off-target activity. the results show that inhibition of HCoV-NL63 PLP2 is achieved by this series of compounds, although significantly weaker inhibition than for SARS-CoV PLpro (micromolar versus nanomolar range), and suggest that SARS-CoV PLpro and HCoV-NL63 PLP2 may display sufficient structural similarities at the active site for the potential development of a dual-target inhibitor. all tested compounds displayed low cytotoxicity levels (CC50 > 68 M) with improved therapeutic index values in Vero E6 cell when compared to 15g. Compounds 3e, 5c, 3j, and 2e displayed similar to slightly improved antiviral activity when compared to 15g. we evaluated the stability of our best new analogues to phase I metabolism by mouse liver microsomes. the lead compound 15g proved to be exceedingly unstable, being completely consumed within 15 min. this was not entirely unexpected because of the presence of the 3,4-methylenedioxy moiety. four compounds (3k, 3e, 3j, and 5c) were found to have more potent SARS-CoV PLpro inhibition and SARS-CoV antiviral activity than the most potent first generation inhibitor, 15g. the second-generation compounds 3k, 3e, and 5c exhibit significantly improved metabolic stability compared to 15g. compounds 3e and 5c are likely to be the better candidates to advance to animal efficacy models. 1H and 13C spectra were obtained in DMSO-d6 or CDCl3 at room temperature, unless otherwise noted. chemical shifts for the 1H and 13C spectra were recorded in parts per million (ppm) on the scale from an internal standard of residual tetramethylsilane (0 ppm). if the rotamers cannot be distinguished, the NMR peaks are described as multiplets.
