{"summary": "the etiologic agent of PRRS is PRRS virus (PRRSV), a small enveloped, linear, single, positive-stranded RNA virus. it is a member of the family Arteriviridae which includes lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus, equine arteritis virus, and simian hemorrhagic fever virus. since the initial PRRS outbreaks in mainland China in 1996, the PRRSV has spread PRRSV replicates predominantly in the alveolar macrophage of the lung. induction of neutralizing antibodies (NAs) is severedly delayed and their levels remain low, which can not eliminate effectively PRRSV-infected cells. characterization of host immune response under in vivo environment to PRRSV is still an area in urgent need of investigation. pig is an excellent biomedical model for humans because of the similarity in size and physiology, and in organ development and disease progression. RNAs in a sample and of differentially expressed genes without prior annotations were analysed. the pulmonary pathological changes of the infected-porcine lungs were systematically analyzed. the relationship between pulmonary gene expression profiles after N-PRRSV infection was systematically analyzed. six pigs were inoculated with 6 ml viral suspension (4 ml intranasally and 2 ml intramuscularly) of classical North American type PRRSV (N-PRRSV) strain CH 1a isolated from china in 1996. three uninfected negative control (UNC) pigs were treated similarly with an identical volume of DMEM culture media from uninfected MARC-145 cells 1 day prior to experimental infection. RNA extraction, library construction and sequencing Total RNA was extracted from frozen lungs using standard protocols. RNA samples from three infected pig lungs were pooled, RNA samples from the three infected individual lungs were pooled. mRNA was isolated from 6g total RNA by binding the mRNA to a magnetic oligo bead. the GEX Adapter 2 was ligated at the site of MmeI cleavage. a PCR with 12 cycles was performed with two primers that anneal to the ends of the adapters to enrich the adapter-ligated cDNA construct. the resulting 85 bp fragments were purified from 6% Novex TBE PAGE gel. qPCRs were done on the Lightcycler480 (Roche) with SYBR-Green detection. each cDNA was analyzed in triplicate, after which the average threshold cycle (Ct) was calculated per sample. the results were normalized to the expression level of HPRT1 and relative to the C sample. two-side Fisher's exact test with a multiple testing and 2 test were used to classify the pathway category. the false discovery rate (FDR) was used to correct the P-value. the two-sided Fisher's exact test p-value for a category reflects a test of the null hypothesis that the category is enriched in genes assigned to profile r with respect to what would have been expected by chance alone. to assess the significance of a particular category, we need to know the distribution of p-values that would occur by random chance. six pigs were inoculated with 6 ml viral suspension (4 ml intranasally and 2 ml intramuscularly) of classical North American type PRRSV (N-PRRSV) strain CH 1a. three uninfected negative control (UNC) pigs were treated similarly with an identical volume of DMEM culture media from uninfected MARC-145 cells 1 day prior to experimental infection. RNA extraction, library construction and sequencing Total RNA was extracted from frozen lungs using standard protocols (Trizol) and then treated with DNase to remove potential genomic DNA contamination according to the manufactures' protocols. mRNA was isolated from 6g total RNA by binding the mRNA to a magnetic oligo bead. the GEX Adapter 2 was ligated at the site of MmeI cleavage. a PCR with 12 cycles was performed with two primers that anneal to the ends of the adapters to enrich the adapter-ligated cDNA construct. the resulting 85 bp fragments were purified from 6% Novex TBE PAGE gel. the number of raw clean tags in each library was normalized to Tags Per Million (TPM) to obtain normalized gene expression level. qPCRs were done on the Lightcycler480 (Roche), with SYBR-Green detection (SYBR PrimeScript RT-PCR Kit, TaKaRa Biotechnology Co., Ltd.) two-side Fisher's exact test with a multiple testing and 2 test were used to classify the pathway category. the false discovery rate (FDR) was used to correct the P-value. the two-sided Fisher's exact test p-value for a category reflects a test of the null hypothesis that the category is enriched in genes assigned to profile r with respect to what would have been expected by chance alone. to determine whether or not to follow up a category that appears enriched in these genes, we would know the statistical reliability of the apparent enrichment. histopathology examination of pigs showed interstitial pneumonia in lungs with thickening of alveolar septa accompanied with infiltration of immune cells. most viral antigen was detected in alveolar cells and bronchiolar epithelial cells in lesions. new emerging distinct tags were gradually reduced with increasing of total sequence tags when the number of sequencing tags reached 3 million. when the number of sequencing tags reached 3 million, library capacity approached saturation. ambiguous Mapping represents the number of unambiguous tags mapped to the UniGene virtual tag database. we preprocessed one reference tag database that included 51670 sequences from sus scrofa Unigene. to get the reference tags, we took all the CATG+17 tags in the gene as the gene's reference tags. 45% and 30% all genes and genes identified by unambigous tags. at this time, library capacity approached saturation. data were presented as fold changes in gene expression normalized to the HPRT1 gene and relative to the C sample. qPCR analysis (both pooling samples and independent RNA extractions from biological replicates) confirmed the direction of change detected. 240 DE genes were distributed in 18 different known QTL regions. 122 and 114 were located in QTL regions of the CD4-Positive Leukocytes. 53 were distributed in the QTL region of the Band-Formed Neutrophils and CD8-Positive Leukocytes. the most prominently overrepresented GO terms of significant cluster profile 1 (0,1,1) and profile 7 (0,1,2), which are up-regulated genes, included negative regulation of fibroblast proliferation; natural killer cell, macrophage, lymphocyte, mononuclear cell, leukocyte and T cell proliferation, differentiation and activation; complement activation, immune response, inflammatory response, defense response, and apoptosis. gene expression was suppressed, and interferon alpha 5 (IFNA5) gene expression was markedly down-regulated. gene expression genes related to regulation of replication and spread of N-PRRSV, anorexia, slow growth. genes shown in red were upregulated and those shown in green were downregulated in infected relative to UNC pigs. factor kappa-B 1 (NFKB1), NFKB2, adrenomedullin (ADM) and interleukin 10 (IL10) downregulation expression of pro-apoptotic genes, including Bak protein (BAK), (apoptosis-related protein 1) (APR1) (Figure 3D) to inhibit apoptosis, which might prolong cell life and increase the yield of progeny virions. ASP1 and IL-1 secretion including apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC), prostaglandin E synthase 2 (PGE2) and phospholipase A2, group VII (PLA2G7) increased. expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) can be markedly upregulated by all cells under conditions of stress, such as increased temperature (fever) and viral infection. protein I (RIG-I, DDX58) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) were expressed at a high level after N-PRRSV infection. cell surface PRRs such as CD14, MD-2 protein (MD2) and CD163 (which is probably involved in PRRSV entry during uncoating [42]) were also up-regulated expression after N-PRRSV infection. accelerating factor CD55, complement component 4 binding protein, alpha (C4BPA), C4BPB, were significantly repressed in the N-PRRSV-infected lungs. transcript abundance of ubiquitin specific peptidase (USP) and ubiquitin enzyme (Figure 6A), 16 proteasomes, and aminopeptidases (Figure 6B) was significantly increased after infection with N-PRRSV. 8 cathepsins and 5 MHC class II antigens were significantly induced in N-PRRSV-infected lungs. transcript abundance of costimulatory molecules (such as CD86, ICOS), CAMs, and TCRs/CD3 complex as well as co-receptor molecules (such as CD8A, CD8B) increased after infection with N-PRRSV. expression of selected cell death and tissues damage -related genes in N-PRRSV-infected porcine lungs. a model for the relationship between pulmonary gene expression profiles and infection pathology can be surmised in Figure 7. a model for the relationship between pulmonary gene expression profiles and infection pathology can be surmised. viruses resulted in fever and inflammatory response, as indicated by high expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, adhesion molecules, inflammatory enzymes and receptors. this was compounded by cell death and elevated expression of NFKBIA, XAF1, GADD45A, perforin, granzymes, and cytochrome c. genes shown in red were upregulated and those shown in green were downregulated in infected relative to UNC most viral antigen was detected in alveolar cells and bronchiolar epithelial cells in lesions. most viral antigen was detected in the alveolar cells and bronchiolar epithelial cells in lesions. when the number of sequencing tags reached 3 million, library capacity approached saturation (Figure S1). Table 1. Major characteristics of DGE libraries and tag mapping to the UniGene transcript database. analysis of tag mapping For tag mapping, we preprocessed one reference tag database that included 51670 sequences from sus scrofa Unigene. we took all the CATG+17 tags in the gene as the gene's reference tags, not only the 3\u2032 most one. the occurrence of unknown tags was probably due to the incompleteness of pig genome sequencing. 5430 genes had p values 0.005, false discovery rate (FDR) 0.01 and estimated absolute log2-fold change >0.5 in at least one of the pairwise comparisons. we chose only significant pathway categories that had a P-value of 0.05 and an FDR of0.05. data were presented as fold changes in gene expression normalized to the HPRT1 gene and relative to the C sample. qPCR analysis (both pooling samples and independent RNA extractions from biological replicates) confirmed the direction of change detected by DGE analysis. 240 DE genes were distributed in 18 different known QTL regions related to pig health traits. 122 and 114 were located in QTL regions of the CD4-Positive Leukocytes and CD2-Positive Leukocytes respectively. 53 were distributed in the QTL region of the Band-Formed Neutrophils. most prominently overrepresented GO terms of significant cluster profile 1 (0,1,1) and profile 0 (0,1,2), which are down-regulated genes, included negative regulation of fibroblast proliferation; natural killer cell, macrophage, lymphocyte, mononuclear cell, leukocyte and T cell proliferation, differentiation and activation. many viruses have also developed strategies to evade and subvert the immune response. genes shown in red were upregulated and those shown in green were downregulated in infected relative to UNC pigs. some viruses enhance their replication by modulating host cell lipid metabolism. transcript abundance of genes involved in digestion significantly decreased. apoptosis may prolong cell life and increase yield of progeny virions. transcript abundance of genes involved in digestion significantly decreased. expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs), known as stress proteins, can be markedly upregulated by all cells under conditions of stress, such as increased temperature (fever) and viral infection. transcript abundance for most of these heat shock genes was significantly elevated in N-PRRSV infected lungs relative to UNC lungs. DA5), the two most relevant for defense against viruses, were expressed at a high level after N-PRRSV infection. cell surface PRRs such as CD14, MD-2 protein (MD2) and CD163 (which is probably involved in PRRSV entry during uncoating [42]) were up-regulated expression after N-PRRSV infection. transcript abundance of ubiquitin specific peptidase (USP) and ubiquitin enzyme (Figure 6A), 16 proteasomes, and aminopeptidases was significantly increased in N-PRRSV-infected lungs. transcript abundance of ubiquitin specific peptidase (USP) and ubiquitin enzyme (Figure 6A), 16 proteasomes, and aminopeptidases (Figure 6B) was significantly increased after infection with N-PRRSV. 8 cathepsins and 5 MHC class II antigens were significantly induced in N-PRRSV-infected lungs. transcript abundance of costimulatory molecules (such as CD86, ICOS), CAMs, and TCRs/CD3 complex as well as co-receptor molecules (such as CD8A, CD8B) was significantly increased after infection with N-PRRSV. expression of selected cell death and tissues damage -related genes in N-PRRSV-infected porcine lungs. a model for the relationship between pulmonary gene expression profiles and infection pathology can be surmised in Figure 7. inflammatory enzymes and receptors such as IL-1, IL8, SELL, ICAM, CCL2, CXCL9, CXCL10, B2M, proteasomes, cathepsins. this was compounded by cell death and elevated expression of NFKBIA, XAF1, GADD45A, perforin, granzymes, and cytochrome c. over 5000 genes were differentially expressed during N-PRRSV infection processes. some studies have pooled biological replicates for library construction and deep sequencing [47], [48], resulting in the lack of biological replicate. one pig could significantly affect results without independent libraries. the induction of expression of type I interferons (IFNs) is a well-known innate antiviral immune reaction in the virus-infected cells [52], [53]. however, N-PRRSV infection suppressed SPI IFN gene expression and decreased the transcript abundance of IFN-. transcript abundance of CD163 was significantly increased after N-PRRSV infection. the internalization of PRRSV via CD163 in the target cells may induce the expression of IL10, and in turn induce the expression of CD163 on neighboring undifferentiated monocytes. infected pigs develop a strong and rapid humoral response. transcript abundance of MMP2 and NGAL significantly increased in lungs of pigs. upregulation expression of IL8 (also known as CXCL8) would likely facilitate infiltration of inflammatory cells and increase inflammation. other chemokines such as CCL2 (also known as MCP1) may also be crucial for lymphocyte and macrophage infiltration into the sites of N-PRRSV infection. IL10 might skew the immune response away from a protective Th1-cell response towards a non-protective Th2-cell response. upregulation expression of anti-inflammatory molecules and pro-inflammatory molecules occurring concurrently was also observed after SARS-CoV and FIPV infection [75], [76]. antibodies might also contribute to immunopathogenesis through increasing the uptake of virus by macrophages. anti-apoptotic genes and pro-apoptotic genes occurring concurrently after N-PRRSV infection seem in contradiction of each other. this may reflect a balance between apoptotic and anti-apoptotic mechanisms. PRRSV activates anti-apoptotic state to complete its virus replication cycle through delaying cell death. apoptosis of infected cells is likely to be a key component in pathogenesis. apoptosis either induces a decrease in the numbers of immune cells. apoptosis of infected cells causes immune suppression by two mechanisms. chemokines, adhesion molecules and inflammatory enzymes induce a pro-inflammatory response, activate and recruit immune cells to sites of infection for virus elimination and thus produce the clinical symptoms of viral infection. antibodies and complement activation might exacerbate inflammatory response. the vertical axis is the pathway category and the horizontal axis is the log10(p Value) of these significant pathways. the X axis represents the QTL symbol, and the Y axis indicates the number of genes associated with Health Traits. 4.0 genes were assigned, p-value = 2.8E-31; (E) profile 7 (0,1,2), 456.0 genes were expected, but 404.0 genes were assigned, p-value = 4.4E-3. a P-value of 0.05 in the two-side Fisher's exact test were selected as the significant criteria. 0.05 in the two-side Fisher's exact test were selected as the significant criteria. the vertical axis is the GO category and the horizontal axis is the enrichment of GO."}
