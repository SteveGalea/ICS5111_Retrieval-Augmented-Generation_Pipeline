{"summary": "a successful vaccine is one of the most cost-effective alternatives for controlling the incidence and mortality of diseases such as influenza [1], cholera [2], bubonic plague [3], hepatitis A [4], yellow fever [5], measles [7], rubella [8], tetanus [9], diphtheria [10], animal disease [11], etc. existing vaccines can be divided into two broad groups: living and non-living vaccines. vaccinated glioblastoma patients exhibited significantly prolonged median survival than those who were not immune. fibrosarcoma is a locally aggressive malignant tumor. antigens play a role in triggering an adaptive immune response. chitosan is insoluble in water and alkaline solutions, and soluble in dilute acid, forming a sticky solution. chitosan contains hydroxyl, amino and other polar groups, showing good hygroscopicity and moisture retention. chitosan can adsorb proteins, amino acids, nucleic acids and other substances by complexation and ion exchange. chitosan has been widely used for its excellent biocompatibility and strong mucoadhesive properties for mucosal drug delivery. however, the instability of the chitosan microparticles makes chitosan MPs easily aggregated. Jiang et al. [25] designed and synthesized pegylated chitosan MPs (PCMPs) using PEG as a water-soluble polymer (Figure 2). PCMPs loaded with Bordetella bronchiseptica dermonecrotoxin (BBD) showed a high BBD loading rate and were more stable than CMPs loaded with BBD, suggesting that BBD-loaded PCMPs could be a promising candidate for BBD vaccine chitosan's coating changed the immune response of PLGA NPs. GC-PLGA NPs showed better local and systemic uptake compared with C-PLGA. chitosan has great potential for mucosal administration of vaccines. chitosan is a very efficient and non-toxic absorption enhancer for orally and nasally administered peptide-based vaccines. chitosan in its protonated form is only water-soluble in acidic environments due to its pKa value. the release of drug from drug-loaded MPs did not interact with the intestinal epithelial cells, and did not affect the permeation of the released drug. the results showed that the release of drug from drug-loaded MPs did not affect the permeation of the released drug. chitosan-modified PLGA (CS-PLGA), mannan-modified PLGA (MN-PLGA), and chitosan co-modified PLGA (MN-CS-PLGA) were used to deliver hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) via nasal administration. results indicated that MN-CS-PLGA MPs induced stronger humoral and cell-mediated immune responses due to specific interaction of mannose and receptors of mannose Mannose receptors are highly expressed on dendritic cells and macrophages, playing a vital role in immune responses. polymers with mannosylation can efficiently bind to macrophages via specific interaction with mannose receptors, resulting in enhanced cellular uptake, further promoting antigen presentation and T cell activation. glucomannosylated chitosan nanoparticles were developed to deliver tetanus toxoid (TT) using the tandem cross-linking method developed by Harde et al. [42] the obtained GMC-NPs acted both as a vaccine carrier and immunopotentiator for TT. significant differences between untreated and immunized groups were expressed as * p 0.001 and ** p 0.05. differences between untreated and immunized groups were expressed as * p 0.001 and ** p 0.05 and between BBD\u2013CMs and BBD\u2013MCMs groups as * p 0.05. peptide ligands and their cell receptors accumulate in coated pits through a receptor-ligand specific interaction. the phage display technique confirms target specificity by an in vitro transcytosis assay and in vivo assay. the peptide ligands were conjugated to water-soluble chitosan. posed reaction scheme for synthesis of CKS9-conjugated water-soluble chitosan. chemically conjugated peptide to water-soluble chitosan using amide linkage. in vivo localization of fluorescent CKS9-WSC-PLGA MPs on the mice Peyer\u2019s patch region 1 h after an injection into closed ileal loops. oral immunization of C terminal 30 amino acids of clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (CPE30 peptide) significantly increased specific fecal SIgA level and augmented mucosal T-cell immune responses against CVB3-induced myocarditis oral immunization of UEA-1-conjugated alginate-coated chitosan NPs induced mucosal immune responses compared to aluminum hydroxide gel-based conventional vaccine. the targets are not present in human M-cells, because the targets are not present in human M-cells. poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG), glycol, poloxamer and alginate have been chosen to conjugate with chitosan. the modifications of the chitosan increase the biocompatibility of chitosan. however, the instability of the chitosan microparticles (CMPs) makes chitosan MPs easily aggregated. chitosan- and GC-coated PLGA nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared with a reaction of chitosan and chloroethanol. bestatin was further conjugated with GC for thymopoietin oligopeptides delivery. chitosan possesses low toxicity, high biocompatibility, biodegradability. chitosan has been widely used for its excellent biocompatibility and strong mucoadhesive properties for mucosal drug delivery. chitosan has been widely used for its excellent biocompatibility and strong mucoadhesive properties. pegylated chitosan MPs (PCMPs) were created using PEG as a water-soluble polymer. chitosan possesses low toxicity, high biocompatibility, biodegradability, mucoadhesive properties, and a permeation enhancing effect. the GC was prepared with a reaction of chitosan and chloroethanol. chitosan coating changed the immune response of PLGA NPs. GC-PLGA NPs showed better local and systemic uptake. chitosan was an indication of the better immune response of PLGA NPs. xamer 408, a non-ionic hydrophilic triblock copolymer, has been used as a protein stabilizer and immunomodulator to improve the instabilities of vaccine proteins. in vitro experiments showed that Bordetella bronchiseptica Dermonecrotoxin (BBD)-loaded CMPs prepared in the presence of F127 showed significantly higher immune-stimulating activities than chitosan MPs. the release of drug from drug-loaded MPs did not interact with the intestinal epithelial cells, and did not affect the permeation of the released drug. the results showed that the release of drug from drug-loaded MPs did not interact with the intestinal epithelial cells. chitosan-modified PLGA (CS-PLGA), mannan-modified PLGA (MN-PLGA) and chitosan co-modified PLGA (MN-CS-PLGA) were used to deliver hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) via nasal administration. results indicated that MN-CS-PLGA MPs induced stronger humoral and cell-mediated immune responses due to specific interaction of mannose and receptors of the combination therapy significantly increased tumor-specific IFN- responses while reducing myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) in mouse local tumor, spleen and bone marrow. also, the combination therapy effectively inhibited the proliferation and growth of tumor cells. glucomannosylated chitosan nanoparticles were developed to deliver tetanus toxoid (TT) using the tandem cross-linking method developed by Harde et al.

MC-NPs elicited significantly higher mucosal, humoral and cellular immune response, which is difficult to achieve simultaneously with commercial TT vaccine. a subcutaneous prostate carcinoma model was established to evaluate in vivo efficacy. M cells in the ALT are located on the follicle-associated epithelium (FAE) they uptake and deliver antigens across mucosal epithelia to the underlying lymphoid tissues to generate protective immune responses through transcytosis. the proportion of M cells out of the total cells of FAE for the rabbit, rodent and human is around 20%, 10% and 5%. CKS9-conjugated chitosan nanoparticles (CKS9-CNs) prepared by ionic gelation were accumulated into Peyer\u2019s patches regions in greater amounts than chitosan nanoparticles. they also conjugated CKS9 with chitosan to coat porous PLGA microparticles to deliver Brachyspira hyodysenteriae (BmpB) as a swine dysentery vaccine. green and red fluorescent signals in each panel indicate the location of the peptides and mucus layer in rat small intestinal tissues. scale bars indicate 50 m in PP and 20 M in Non-PP. oral immunization of chitosan/VP1 DNA vaccine nanoparticles significantly increased specific fecal SIgA level and augmented mucosal T-cell immune responses against CVB3-induced myocarditis. most-studied lectin is ulex europaeus agglutinin1 (UEA-1), as the -l-fucose-specific lectin. chitosan microspheres loaded a reduced brominated derivative of noscapine (Red-Br-Nos) to increase the anti-inflammatory response in dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis model mice. the results indicated that the surface bioadhesive properties of WGA-conjugated CMs loaded with Red-Br-Nos promoted affinity toward colon mucin cells in simulated colonic fluid. the proportion of M cells out of the total cells of FAE for the rabbit, rodent and human is around 20%, 10% and 5%. it has been reported that they originate from stem cells in crypts located between a villus and a peyer\u2019s patch dome. the porous surface and internal morphologies of BmpB-PLGA and BmpB-WSC-PLGA MPs were observed to be spherical shapes. it was also found that oral immunization of PLGA microparticles coated with CKS9-conjugated chitosan showed elevated secretory IgA responses in the mucosal tissue and systemic IgG antibody responses.
