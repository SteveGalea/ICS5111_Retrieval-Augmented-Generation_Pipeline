{"summary": "pertussis is a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by bacteria Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella parapertussis. infection with these organisms can lead to potentially life-threatening complications such as pneumonia, weight loss, dehydration, and seizures. an estimated 24.1 million cases and over 160,000 deaths are recorded annually worldwide. culture affords excellent (nearly 100%) specificity, requires up to 7 days to obtain results. culture is most successful during the first 1 to 2 weeks following cough onset in unvaccinated patients who have not received antibiotics. the assay detects the pertussis toxin (ptxA) promoter and IS1001 of B. pertussis and B. parapertussis respectively. the current study evaluated the analytical performance of the Aries Bordetella Assay system by conducting a large-scale multisite evaluation of the assay. arm 1 was the blinded prospective evaluation of nasopharyngeal swabs collected from subjects with symptoms of B. pertussis or B. parapertussis infection but without accompanying diagnostic information. arm 3 contained 50 contrived specimens spiked with B. parapertussis strains at clinically relevant titers. four specimen aliquots (250 l) were stored at 2 to 8\u00b0C. external positive controls included pooled B. pertussis A639 and B. parapertussis A747 cultures diluted in natural negative nasopharyngeal matrix. negative controls consisted of vehicle only. arm 1 samples had previously been tested at each site using the in-house standard-of-care (SOC) assay. each site used its own laboratory-developed real-time PCR assay targeting IS481 and IS1001 for B. pertussis and B. parapertussis. initial findings remain undisclosed until the study terminus. cross-reactivity of the Aries Bordetella Assay was evaluated in 18 strains of B. pertussis and B. parapertussis in samples created with 3LoD, 10LoD, and 100LoD of these organisms. erroneous detection of high-concentration suspensions (in NPM) of 71 non-B. pertussis/non-B. parapertussis potential cross-reacting organisms (CROs) high (106 CFUml1) concentrations of either B. pertussis or B. parapertussis were spiked into 3LoD suspensions of the other Bordetella species. in a separate experiment, suspensions of B. pertussis or B. parapertussis (3, 10, and 100LoD) were assayed immediately or after freezing at 70\u00b0C for 2 days. inclusion criteria included subjects with signs and symptoms consistent with B. pertussis and/or B. parapertussis infection. subjects who provided a nasopharyngeal swab specimen were excluded if subjects had used antibiotics within 24 h of specimen collection. arm 1 was the blinded prospective evaluation of nasopharyngeal swabs collected from subjects with symptoms of B. pertussis or B. parapertussis infection but without accompanying diagnostic information. arm 3 contained 50 contrived specimens spiked with B. parapertussis strains at clinically relevant titers. external positive controls included pooled B. pertussis A639 and B. parapertussis A747 cultures diluted in natural negative nasopharyngeal matrix (NPM) negative controls consisted of vehicle only. Specimens testing negative for Bordetella were required to have a positive result. two sites performed a laboratory-developed test (LDT) using Luminex MultiCode analyte-specific reagents. one site used a TaqMan-based (Thermo Fisher, Foster City, CA) LDT. the AIRES Bordetella assay was evaluated for LoDs, intralaboratory/interoperator and site-to-site reproducibility. cross-reactivity of the Aries Bordetella Assay was evaluated in 18 strains of B. pertussis and B. parapertussis in samples created with 3LoD, 10LoD, and 100LoD of these organisms. we also evaluated erroneous detection of high-concentration suspensions (in NPM) of 71 non-B. pertussis/non-B. parapertussis potential cross-reacting organisms (C we evaluated positive detection of 3LoD B. pertussis and B. parapertussis samples suspended in NPM that had been stored at 20 to 25\u00b0C for 0, 2, 4, 8 and 10 h. suspensions of B. pertussis or B. parapertussis (3, 10, and 100LoD) were assayed immediately or after freezing at 70\u00b0C for 2 days. of 1,053 unique nasopharyngeal swab specimens from 1,053 subjects presenting with pertussis-like disease were collected at five study sites during July to November 2015. one specimen was excluded from performance calculations due to refrigerator storage for >72 h, leaving 1,052 evaluable specimens. most of the subjects were 18 years old, 56% were female, and nearly 74% visited outpatient clinics. tussis by the Aries assay and by the Aries-positive comparator sequencing assay initially tested B. pertussis positive by the study sites\u2019 in-house SOC assay for IS481. these samples were further tested by Luminex using a validated high-sensitivity endpoint nested-PCR assay followed by bidirectional sequencing for B. pertussis. 6-076 NEG 36.0 06-125 POS

prospective specimens generated false-negative results by the Aries Bordetella Assay PPA and NPA for detection of B. pertussis and B. parapertussis versus comparator real-time PCR assays. one of the two specimens gave a positive result in only one of two comparator real-time PCR assays. a set of 57 preselected nasopharyngeal swabs (37 for B. pertussis and 20 for B. parapertussis) were obtained from study sites that had been previously characterized as positive for these pathogens. nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from study sites that had been previously characterized as positive for these pathogens. the LoD was defined as the lowest concentration of Bordetella that was detectable in 95% of 20 replicates. in B. pertussis strains A639 and BAA-589, LoDs were 1,640 CFUml1 and 1,800 CFUml1, respectively. 66 were nonreactive with the Aries Bordetella Assay at high titers. all seven B. parapertussis strains were detected at 100% positivity in testing at 3LoD. in interference assays performed with Bordetella suspensions spiked with CROs, B. pertussis was correctly detected in 3/3 (100%) replicates in the presence of 66 CROs. five CROs in total required testing of 3 additional replicates per protocol. a total of 1,053 unique nasopharyngeal swab specimens from 1,053 subjects presenting with pertussis-like disease were collected at five study sites during July to November 2015. most (74%) of the subjects were 18 years old, 56% were female, and nearly 74% visited outpatient clinics. compared results of the Aries assay to the result initially obtained by each site using their in-house SOC assay for IS481. of the 1,052 evaluated specimens in arm 1, 23 were negative for B. pertussis by the Aries assay and by the Aries-positive comparator sequencing assay but had initially tested B. pertussis positive by the study sites\u2019 in-house SOC assay for IS481. of 1,052 unique specimens in prospective arm 1, 1,043 (99.1%) yielded valid results on the first run. the remaining 9/1,052 (0.9%) initially produced invalid results due to run failure or instrument error but generated valid results (positive or negative) upon retesting. preselected specimens tested positive for B. pertussis and B. parapertussis. prospective specimens generated false-negative results by the Aries Bordetella Assay. one of the two specimens gave a positive result in only one of two comparator real-time PCR assays. a set of 57 preselected nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from study sites that had been previously characterized as positive for these pathogens. both the PPA and NPA for both B. pertussis and B. parapertussis were 100%, with the lower CI bound satisfying the desired criterion. the LoD was defined as the lowest concentration of Bordetella that was detectable in 95% of 20 replicates. nine of 11 (81.8%) B. pertussis strains were detected at 100% positivity at 3LoD. two B. pertussis strains, ATCC 8478 and ATCC 9797, were not detected at up to 100LoD. five CROs required testing of 3 additional replicates per protocol. no differences were seen in the rates of detection of identical suspensions of B. pertussis or B. parapertussis. microbiological culture of nasopharyngeal swabs is the most specific means of detecting and delineating B. pertussis and B. parapertussis. this time lag delays implementation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy and infection control measures. the overlapping symptomatologies caused by B. pertussis and B. parapertussis increase the importance of the ability to confidently identify and differentiate these two most common human-pathogenic Bordetella species. the Aries Bordetella Assay consistently detected the presence of low titers of 9 B. pertussis and 7 B. parapertussis strains. the Aries Bordetella Assay has a low likelihood of falsely detecting a potential CRO as B. pertussis or B. parapertussis. the single-copy ptxA gene is present only in B. pertussis. the ptxA gene is present only in B. pertussis. 71 potential CROs assayed, 66 (93%) were not detected by the Aries assay. two organisms produced a single false-positive result for B. pertussis that was not replicateable in triplicate retesting. three CROs generated a single false-positive result for B. parapertussis that was not repeatable. the respective PPAs for B. pertussis and B. parapertussis were 99.0% and 99.7%, respectively, with lower 95% CI bounds above the minimum 85% specification for both organisms. the diagnostic accuracy of the Aries Bordetella Assay is acceptable for effectively detecting B. pertussis and B. parapertussis in nasopharyngeal swabs from patients suspected of having respiratory tract infection attributable to either pathogen only approximately 5% of 149 tested B. bronchiseptica isolates express IS481. the IS481 assay may also produce false-positive B. pertussis findings by detecting high-copy-number IS481 DNA on lightly contaminated laboratory surfaces (30) or even from aerosolized pertussis vaccines. the Aries system can simultaneously evaluate up to 12 samples, with minimal hands-on time required during its 2-h runtime. the self-contained assay cartridges include all reaction components and an internal sample processing control."}
