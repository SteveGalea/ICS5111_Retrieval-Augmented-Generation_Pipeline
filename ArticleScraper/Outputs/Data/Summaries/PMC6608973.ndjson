{"summary": "SAFV is a small non-enveloped virus with a single-stranded RNA of about 8,050 nucleotides. the virus name traces back to the name of the first author of the original description. the virus was found in feces from Asian children with non-polio acute flaccid paralysis [9] and in cerebrospinal fluid specimens of patients with aseptic meningitis [12, 20\u201321]. TMEV is known to cause a multiple sclerosis (MS)-like syndrome in mice [21]. ii) reports failing to detect SAFV in samples from diseased patients. adenoid tissue samples were obtained from 70 patients consecutively admitted for adenoidectomy. all patients had clinical symptoms caused by hypertrophy of adenoids. at the time of surgery and the 2 weeks before, no children displayed symptoms of acute upper or lower airway infection. RT-PCR was performed in a volume of 25 L containing 5 L RNA preparation (approximately 1.25 mg) RT and cycling conditions were 52\u00b0C for 20 min, denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 3 min, followed by 45 PCR cycles. the PCR amplified a 187-bp fragment of the SAFV genome within the 5 untranslated region (5 UTR) RT and cycling conditions were as follows: 48\u00b0C for 30 min, 95\u00b0C for 5 min, 35 cycles each consisting of 95\u00b0C for 1 min, 50\u00b0C for 1 min, 72\u00b0C for 1 min, followed by 72\u00b0C for 5 min. nested PCR, 95\u00b0C for 3 min, 35 cycles (94\u00b0C for 1 min, 60\u00b0C for 1 min, 72\u00b0C for 1 min, 72\u00b0C for 1 min), 72\u00b0C for 5 min. tested viruses were Influenza A and B viruses, Human parainfluenza viruses 1\u20134 (now termed Human respiroviruses 1 and 3, Human rubulaviruses 2 and 4), Human Rhinovirus, Human respiratory syncytial virus, Human metapneumovirus, Enterovirus, Human parechovirus and Human coronaviruses 229E, NL63, HKU-1, and OC43, and human adenovirus. sequence analysis Extirpated adenoids were picked up in the surgical room and transported on ice to the laboratory for immediate preparation. the lysate was homogenized by using QIAshredder homogenizer spin columns (Qiagen) according to manufacturer s instructions. lified a 187-bp fragment of the SAFV genome within the 5 untranslated region (5 UTR) the limit of detection 95% (LOD95) was 9 copies per reaction. samples tested positive were subjected to nested RT-PCR. amplified products were visualized on agarose gels and subjected to DNA cycle sequencing using BigDye Terminator technology. Sequences were manually reviewed and compared with genome sequences in GenBank. results Out of 70 adenoid tissue specimens tested by the screening RT-PCR, eleven (15.7%) were positive for SAFV RNA. the ages of the SAFV-positive patients ranged from 3 to 10 years (median 5 years) HAdV 9 f, 6 2.94 log10 2.56 log10 EV, HBoV, HPIV-1, -2 HAdV, HBoV 10 m, 8 1 log10 n.d. EV neg. yrs, years; male; f, female; rx, reaction SAFV, Saffold cardiovirus; n.d., not done; neg., negative; EV, Enterovirus; HBoV, Human classical respiratory viruses were also found in every case of the 11 SAFV-positive adenoid samples. Enterovirus was the most frequent one (n = 9, 81.8%) followed by Human bocavirus (n = 7, 63.6%) and one of the four Human parainfluenza viruses (n = 5; 45%). no. tested Children No. SAFV-positives No. SAFV-negatives No. of children with other viruses 0 virus 1\u20132 viruses > 2 viruses 0\u20131 2 0 2 0 1 1 2\u20133 21 1 20 4 15 2 4\u20135 12 0 12 6 6 6\u20137 6 1 5 2 4 8\u20139 0 10\u201311 4 0 4 3 1 12\u201313 0 Total (%) 45 2 (4%) 43 (96%) 15 (60%) 3 (7%) in literature, there are only very few reports describing analysis of SAFV in specimens from asymptomatic children. in contrast, these authors did not detect any SAFV positives among the asymptomatic children while 25/1829 (1.37%) swabs from children with respiratory symptoms were positive. a larger cohort of 1,525 children with acute respiratory infections in japan, SAFV2 was found in 3.5% of nasopharyngeal swabs [28]. in another study from bejing including 1,558 children, SAFV was detected in 0.6% of nasopharyngeal aspirates from 506 patients with upper respiratory tract infection and in 0.4% of 1,032 patients with lower respiratory tract infections. enterovirus was the most frequent co-detected virus (9/11 (81.8%), followed by human bocavirus (7/11 (63.6%) in the SAFV-negative tissues, both viruses were less frequently found. the differences between the SAFV-positive and negative group are not statistically significant. study at least demonstrated that SAFV can be detected at a relatively high rate in the adenoids of asymptomatic children. additional studies with enlarged sample size including both adolescents and adults as well as attempts for SAFV isolation in cell culture are needed to clarify the duration period of SAFV persistence in tissue."}
