{"summary": "phylogenetic analysis provided convincing evidence that the primordial CEA gene family in mammals consisted of five genes, including the immune inhibitory receptor-encoding CEACAM1 ancestor. the number of CEACAM1-related genes varies considerably between mammalian species from less than five in lagomorphs to more than 100 in bats. the appearance of PSG-like genes correlates with invasive trophoblast growth in these species. phylogenetic studies provide evidence that pathogen/host coevolution led to a highly species-specific diversity of mammalian genomes. the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) gene family may represent a paradigm for such gene families because it is highly divergent in humans, mice and dogs. the CEA family is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily (igSF) and the pregnancy specific glycoprotein (PSG) subgroups. transmembrane proteins with either a very short or a long cytoplasmic tail can harbour immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs (ITIMs), immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motifs (ITSMs) or ITAMs. the human GPI-linked CEACAM5/CEA and CEACAM6 are involved in the maintenance of the gastrointestinal tissue architecture. these functions are critically dependent on the presence of the GPI anchor. CEACAM3 mediates the opsonin-independent recognition of a restricted set of human-specific Gram-negative bacterial pathogens. this property of CEACAM3 is critically dependant on the presence of the ITAM-related motif. only CEACAM1a represents a high affinity receptor for MHV [22] eutherian superclades, marsupial and monotreme clades are key drivers of CEA family evolution. we found an unexpected diversity of the CEA gene family with respect to secreted PSG-like proteins between different clades, as well as within individual clades. our results provide further evidence that the CEA gene family is shaped by pathogen-host interaction and species-specific reproductive requirements. we did not find any new exons that had not been seen before in humans, mice, rats and dogs. we did not find any new exons that had not been seen before in humans, mice, rats and dogs. the variability of the CEA gene families in eutherians is due to different arrangement of these basic exons. xodonto africana

number of members with ITAM or ITAM-like motifs and ITIM or ITSM are separated by slashes. a allelic variants exist which were not classifiable as ITIM nor as ITSM. cleotide sequences of CEACAM16, CEACAM18, CEACAM19 and CEACAM20 from different species cluster together. these genes were generated independently by multiple rounds of duplication of an ancestral CEACAM1 gene possibly followed by gene conversion events. this notion is supported by similar analyses using IgC-like A and B domain exons. the platypus (CEACAM16L, L stands for like) consists of four N domain exons. in cattle, one of the duplicated CEACAM18 genes most probably represents a pseudogene. a second CEACAM20-like gene (CEACAM22) with identical extracellular domain composition (LNA1B1A2B2) exists in the opossum. similar groups were discriminated using B domain exons (B) genes were identified based on the presence of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs (ITIM)/immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motif (ITSM) in the encoded cytoplasmic domains. arrowheads represent genes with their transcriptional orientation. names of CEACAM1-like genes with immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif/immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motif are shown in red. opossum chromosome 4, cattle chromosome 18 and human chromosome 19 regions. all genes with identifiable orthologues form a cluster (CEACAM16, CEACAM19, CEACAM18a, CEACAM18b, CEACAM22, CEACAM20) only interrupted by one non-CEA-related gene (polio virus receptor) directly downstream of CEACAM16 the BCL3 is found. inversions must have taken place independently within different clades in cattle and mice between the two CEACAM1-like gene loci. this is evident from the inverted order of the intervening genes bracketed by LIPE and CD79A. the expansion of PSG-like genes took place either close to CEACAM1 as in higher primates, or distal to the orthologous CEACAM gene cluster. exons exhibit some selective pressure (dN/dS ratio 1). based on the accumulation of nonsynonymous substitutions along codons for the extracellular domains of seven species from five different mammalian orders. regions with high and low pressure for conservation marked by red and black dotted lines could be identified. the dN/dS ratios were calculated after manual editing of sequence gaps or insertions guided by the amino acid sequences for all branches of the resulting phylogenetic trees. whole N domain exons were used for analysis including the regions (the first 12 codons) which encode part of the leader. most amino acid positions, which are important for interactions between CEACAMs and their viral and bacterial ligands, are located in the CFG face where no conservation is observed at all. in the region encoded by cytoplasmic domain exon 3 of most species one ITIM and one ITSM each are found. tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-like motif from eutherians (B) and marsupials (C) from the indicated species were aligned according to exon borders. the names of the cytoplasmic domain encoding exons (Cyt) and the intron types (0, xxx-intron-xxx; 1, x-intron-xx; 2, xx-intron-x; xxx = codon) are many of the non-CEACAM1 transmembrane-bound members of the CECAM1-related group of proteins contain a cytoplasmic domain encoded by four exons mostly conserved in size. the sequences of nine species from four different mammalian clades were analysed and found to be highly variable except for a conserved ITAM-like motif which lacks the negatively charged amino acid (D or E) N-terminal. in mice, the CEACAM1-related members of the CEA gene family including CEACAM1 consist of 18 genes and 11 pseudogenes. similar numbers of genes were found in other great apes (orangutans, chimpanzee) and in the rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) in the armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), we identified 10 putative CEACAM1-related genes. in the genome of the opossum, we could identify 21 CEACAM1-related genes located on two chromosomes. monotremata represent the most divergent mammals and exhibit both reptilian and mammalian features. no PSG-related genes could be found in more distantly related primates. at least five equine CEACAM-related genes might represent PSG genes. evidence for placental expression is based on the identification of two EST sequences in horse trophoblast cDNA libraries. opossum (A), cattle (B), dogs (C) and humans (D) were reconstructed using the neighbour-joining method. the statistical support for each node is expressed as bootstrap values. genes with ITIM or ITAM-like signalling motif exons are either the closest relatives (B, C) or belong to the same subgroup of closely related members (A, D) signal peptide sequences are present in various CEACAMs. they have not been detected in rodents, dogs, horses or cattle. this contrasts with the formation of GPI signal peptide-encoding exons in old world monkeys. paired receptors often involve recombination events within or in the neighborhood of exons encoding the ligand-binding domains. we calculated cumulative synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions along the N domain exons from pairs of CEACAM1-related paralogous genes. the corresponding N domain amino acid sequences probably contain segments which are important for (bacterial) ligand binding. paired receptor genes of the opossum homology also encompasses the first cytoplasmic domain exon. the last two (three in opossum) cytoplasmic domain exons from a CEACAM ancestor encoding ITIM/ITSM have been replaced by four (three in opossum) cytoplasmic domain exons from an ITAM-encoding ancestor. stretches of codons with no or minimal accumulation of synonymous substitutions suggest recent recombination events. no such recent events are evident for the putative paired receptors CEACAM114 and CEACAM111 and CEACAM112 and CEACAM111. proteins expressed in trophoblast tissues vary in their number of IgV-like and IgC-like domains. so far, proteins with multiple contiguous N domains are only predicted to exist in rodents (trophoblast-expressed proteins) and platypus (CEACAM16-like protein) exon nucleotide sequences of CEACAM16, CEACAM18, CEACAM19 and CEACAM20 from different species cluster together. these genes were generated independently by multiple rounds of duplication of an ancestral CEACAM1 gene possibly followed by gene conversion events. this

tyrosine-based activation motif. inverse orientation of the opossum chromosome 4, cattle chromosome 18 and human chromosome 19 regions. chromosomal arrangement of the CEA gene family in distantly related mammalian species with high coverage genome sequencing or finished genomes. in the opossum, except for CEACAM1, all genes with identifiable orthologues form a cluster. inversions must have taken place independently within different clades in cattle and mice between the two CEACAM1-like gene loci. this is evident from the inverted order of the intervening genes bracketed by LIPE and CD79A. the expansion of PSG-like genes took place either close to CEACAM1 as in higher primates, or distal to the orthologous CEACAM gene cluster. regions with high and low pressure for conservation marked by red and black dotted lines could be identified. the synonymous substitutions accumulate at the same rate (34.5 +/- 1.6 substitutions per 100 codons) for all N domain exons. dN/dS ratios were calculated after manual editing of sequence gaps or insertions guided by the amino acid sequences for all branches of the resulting phylogenetic trees. dN/dS values significantly greater than 1 indicate selective pressure for variability, a ratio less than 1 indicates pressures to conserve the protein sequence. only seven positions are conserved in the N domain amino acid sequence of CEACAM1 from 13 species. most amino acid positions are located in the CFG face where no conservation is observed at all. in the region encoded by cytoplasmic domain exon 3 of most species one ITIM and one ITSM each are found. a serine encoded by the second cytoplasmic exon of CEACAM1 is highly conserved. the names of the cytoplasmic domain encoding exons (Cyt) and the intron types (0, xxx-intron-xxx; 1, x-intron-xx; 2, xx-intron-x; xxx = codon) are indicated. an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) is defined by the sequence (I/L/V/S)xYxx(L/V/I), an ITAM by ( many of the non-CEACAM1 transmembrane-bound members of the CECAM1-related group of proteins contain a cytoplasmic domain encoded by four exons mostly conserved in size. the sequences of nine species from four different mammalian clades were analysed and found to be highly variable except for a conserved ITAM-like motif which lacks the negatively charged amino acid (D or E) N-terminal. in mice, the

CEACAM1-related genes located on two chromosomes. monotremata represent the most divergent mammals and exhibit both reptilian and mammalian features. no PSG-related genes could be found in more distantly related primates. at least five equine CEACAM-related genes might represent PSG genes. evidence for placental expression is based on the identification of two EST sequences in horse trophoblast cDNA libraries. family members from opossum (A), cattle (B), dogs (C) and humans (D) were reconstructed based on amino acid sequences differences of mature N domains. the statistical support for each node is expressed as bootstrap values. genes with ITIM or ITAM-like signalling motif exons are either the closest relatives (B, C) or belong to the same subgroup of closely related members (A, D) three different EST sequences indicate that three nucleotides were deleted from an ancestral CEACAM1 transmembrane domain exon. a stop codon six nucleotides downstream was introduced by mutations exactly as found in the New World monkeys. this contrasts with the formation of GPI signal peptide-encoding exons in Old World monkeys where a single nucleotide deletion occurred. paired receptors often have recombination events within or in the neighborhood of exons encoding the ligand-binding domains. we calculated cumulative synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions along the N domain exons from pairs of CEACAM1-related paralogous genes coding for potential paired receptor candidates. this is suggested from the stretches of codons with no or minimal accumulation of synonymous substitutions. paired receptor genes of the opossum homology also encompasses the first cytoplasmic domain exon. the last two (three in opossum) cytoplasmic domain exons from a CEACAM ancestor encoding ITIM/ITSM have been replaced by four (three in opossum) cytoplasmic domain exons from an ITAM-encoding ancestor. stretches of codons with no or minimal accumulation of synonymous substitutions suggest recent recombination events. no such recent events are evident for the putative paired receptors CEACAM114 and CEACAM111 and CEACAM112 and CEACAM111. proteins expressed in trophoblast tissues vary in their number of IgV-like and IgC-like domains. so far, proteins with multiple contiguous N domains are only predicted to exist in rodents (trophoblast-expressed proteins) and platypus (CEACAM16-like protein) the birth of the CEA gene family during evolution is not yet clear. a CEACAM1-like gene probably represents the ancestor of the family. the ancestral CEA gene family probably arose from a single locus next to the BCL3 gene by successive gene duplication. this is evident from analyses of synonymous (dS) and nonsynonymous substitution rates (dN) within the nucleotide sequences of their N domain exons. the observed dN/dS ratio of about 0.1 for the CEACAM16 N2 domain exons indicates a high selective pressure on the conservation of this domain. however, selection for diversification and purifying selection for structurally important regions probably exist side by side in the N domain regions leading to an average dN the conserved histidine (H) and, to a lesser degree, the lysine (K) are most instrumental for the specific interaction of CEACAM1 with -catenin. this possibly links CEACAM1 to the Wnt signalling pathway which could explain CEACAM1's role in differentiation. most of the genes coding for transmembrane-anchored eutherian CEACAM1-related proteins contain a set of four phylogenetically related cytoplasmic domain exons. the second part of the ITAM represents an YxxM motif known to mediate Vav binding upon tyrosine phosphorylation. this can be induced by the binding of neisserial pathogens to the granulocyte-specific CEACAM3 followed a similar YxN motif is encoded by the same sized cytoplasmic domain exon 2 of CEACAM20 which suggests common ancestry. the most obvious difference between mammalian CEA gene families is their extreme size variation of the CEACAM1-related members. the only other species with candidate PSG genes is the bat (M. lucifugus) and the horse comprising at least 18 and five potential PSGs. a specialized highly invasive trophoblast cell population exists that forms so-called endometrial cups responsible for the secretion of chorionic gonadotrophin. expression of ligands in virus-infected cells has been identified as immune evasion mechanisms. binding of the MHC class I-related proteins UL18 encoded by human cytomegalovirus (CMV) and m157 from murine CMV to the inhibitory leukocyte Ig-like receptor (LILR B1 or LILRB4 and Ly49I, respectively, inhibit NK cells [3,46]. an allelic variant of CEACAM1 with lowered pathogen ligand affinity has been identified for mouse hepatitis virus. a candidate viral pathogen has been found to use bovine CEACAM1 as a receptor. a countermeasure against downregulation of immune responses by pathogens via inhibitory receptors has been observed with other receptor systems. binding to pathogen-derived sialic acid might be driving force behind formation of paired receptors. paired receptors also exist in the CEA family, which might share endogenous or pathogen ligands. at present it is not clear whether the ITAM-like motifs found in the paired receptors represent internalization or activation signals. the formation of paired receptor genes may also occur by an illegitimate recombination between sister chromatids. the target gene was possibly created by gene duplication of the closely related neighbour gene (CEACAM29) which then exchanged a 2.2 kb DNA fragment comprising the leader and the N domain exons with CEACAM1 to form CEACAM28. phylogenetic analyses of the CEA families from over 20 mammalian species revealed two mechanisms which could be responsible for the evolutionary diversity. pressure exerted by pathogens binding to CEA members and possible involvement in fetal-maternal conflict processes of members expressed in the fetal trophoblast. genomes were reprobed with corresponding exon sequences from newly discovered genes. distinct CEACAM1-like N domain exons with a sequence divergence > 1% were counted. no evidence
