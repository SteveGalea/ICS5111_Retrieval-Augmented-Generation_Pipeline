{"summary": "SARS coronavirus is the etiologic agent for the epidemic of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. the recent emergence of this new pathogen allows the exploration of the mutational dynamics of the SARS-CoV in human populations. we sequenced complete SARS-CoV genomes taken from primary human tissues. the putative origin of the SARS epidemic was in late October 2002. a new coronavirus, the SARS-CoV, was identified to be the cause of SARS [1,2] and rapidly sequenced and characterized. a significant increase in the number of SARS-CoV genomes sequenced. a total of 54 SARS-CoV genomic sequences are used in our current analysis. this large dataset coupled with the availability of clinical data for cases related to Singapore patients. the RNA of the virus was first isolated using QiAmp viral RNA mini kit. then reverse-transcribed into cDNA. the extension products were then detected in the MassARRAY (from Sequenom) to determine the genotypes. in the estimation of SARS-CoV daily mutation rate, we employed the conservative constant mutation rate model [9]. the number of mutations d found in an isolate from its ancestor is proportional to the mutation rate k and the temporal difference t between the isolate and its ancestor, so that d = k t. dx = d0 + kx, where k is the daily rate of mutation, x is the sampling date measured relative to 1st November 2002. dx is the number of mutations, as compared to civet cat isolate, of the isolate sampled at date x. the phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using the filtered variations. the reconstruction was done using PAUP* [8] with Maximum Likelihood criterion, keeping the other parameters to the default. d = k = k = k = k = k = k = k = k = k = k = k = k = k = k = k = k = k = k = k = k = k = k = k = k = k = k = k = k = k = k = k = k = k = k = k = k = k the date of origin can be solved by solving x for dx = 0. The goodness-of-fit was measured using the adjusted R-square statistic. results showed that the Vero cell passages are actually comprise of two coexisting quasispecies bearing either an A or G at position 18372. ase ExoN homolog [R/G] Mutations associated with human-to-vero and vero-to-human transition. mutations emerged in only one case of human to vero cell passage posted in Genbank (AS HSR1) but in none of the Singapore pairs. a stable lab SARS-CoV isolate accidentally infected a laboratory worker. the mutation rate from a single point source of virus has a low mutation rate when expanded during human infection. the rate of SARS-CoV mutation in culture was not previously known. a total of 54 isolates were analyzed, including 22 from Singapore. the number of mutations appearing in only one isolate is high at 349. the probability of finding any false mutation shared by more than two isolates out of 54 is very low. the biological validity of this approach by examining the mutational frequency of known genes in the SARS-CoV. we suspected that true non-synonymous mutations in the SARS-CoV present in clinical samples might be rare in these two ORFs. without a mutation filter, sequence variations are commonly observed in the 3CL protease and the polymerase genes. RA grouped with the Singaporean branch were actually derived from the doctor who treated the patient SIN2774 and was later hospitalized in Frankfurt. the clinical contact tracing data was ambiguous as to the direct source of SIN2679's exposure. however, SIN2679 was the root of a second sub-branch within Singapore that had its origins most probably from the Hotel M cluster. synonymous mutations were equivalent at 2.5 10-6 and 3.2 10-6 nucleotide substitutions per site per day respectively. the daily substitution rate was 0.1303 nucleotides per day, or 4.3 10-6 nucleotide substitutions per site per day. the estimated possible \"date\" of SARS-CoV emergence was Oct 21, 2002. SARS-CoV mutations in vitro first, we sought to determine the rate of mutation of the SARS-CoV in vero cell culture. we subjected SIN2774 isolate to 5 passages in vero cells. at the appearance of cytolysis at each passage samples were withdrawn. the transition from human tissue to growth in vero cell culture engendered mutations or clonal selection. mutations emerged in only one case of human to vero cell passage posted in Genbank. the viral sequence from SIN3725V isolated from a lung sample showed evidence for co-infection by two distinct genotypes. quasispecies selection (SIN3275V SIN849M) and new emergence (AS HSR1) are observed during the transmission of SARS-CoV from human tissue sample into vero cell culture. a stable lab SARS-CoV isolate accidentally infected a laboratory worker. a total of 54 isolates were analyzed, including 22 from Singapore. the number of mutations appearing in only one isolate is high at 349. the probability of finding any false mutation shared by more than two isolates is very low. the curve essentially flattens around 3, which corresponds to the filtering scheme that considers a sequence variation as a real mutation if it is shared by more than two isolates. we suspected true non-synonymous mutations in the SARS-CoV present in clinical samples might be rare in these two ORFs. four major clusters appeared: two Singaporean branches, one Taiwan branch, and one North China branch. the two sequences from Germany, 'Frankfurt' and FRA were actually derived from the Singaporean doctor who treated the patient SIN2774 and was later hospitalized in Frankfurt. the clinical contact tracing data was ambiguous as to the direct source of SIN2679's exposure. the rates for synonymous and non-synonymous mutations were equivalent at 2.5 10-6 and 3.2 10-6 nucleotide substitutions per site per day respectively. we calculated the daily substitution rate to be 0.1303 nucleotides per day. the estimated possible \"date\" of SZ3/SZ16 emergence was Oct 21, 2002. arrows drawn on top of the genome indicate nucleotide mutations. significant multiple-nucleotide deletions (pink bar) and insertions (light-blue bar) were also observed. the overall rate of mutation in culture is low. the earliest possible date for SARS emergence is predicted to be Oct 21, 2002. the earliest possible date for SARS emergence is predicted to be Oct 21, 2002. this table is available at http://giscompute.gis.a-star.edu.sg/sars_mut_dyn/ Click here for file (294.5KB, xls) Table 3 Complete list of single nucleotide variations (SNVs) observed in the 54 SARS-CoV isolates. this study was supported by the Agency for Science, Technology, and Research of Singapore, and the Biomedical Research Council of Singapore. authors wish to express their appreciation to Mr. Thoreau Herve, Mr. Landri Lim, Ms. Carine Bonnard, Mr. Meah Wee Yang, and Ms. Lin Su."}
