{"summary": "DNA vaccines are being investigated for various applications including therapy of cancer [2], allergies [3], autoimmune [4] and infectious diseases [5]. in the us, at the moment over 500 clinical trials that focus on DNA vaccination are registered, targeting especially viral infections [6] and cancer [7]. iDC results in endogenous transgene expression, and hence parallel presentation via MHCI and MHCII. a humoral immune response is induced if the B cell receptor recognizes the protein antigen, and acquires help by pre-activated antigen-specific CD4+ T cells. in this case, antigen-presenting APC migrate into the draining lymph node. the most serious challenges for DNA vaccines are caused by immune evasion strategies of the tumor. in this regard, tumor cells are often characterized by defective processing of antigens for subsequent presentation via MHCI [21], and impaired expression of MHCI [22]. besides, within the tumor microenvironment both parenchymal and infiltrated immune cells may overexpress tolerance-promoting non-classical MHCI molecules. the integration frequency was well below the number of spontaneous gene mutations. the majority of plasmid DNA was administered into skeletal muscles of different rodents. the majority of plasmid DNA was found to remain at the injection site, while minor fractions were also detected in other organs, including the gonads. no antibody response against prokaryotic parts of the DNA vaccine has been observed. adverse effects are limited to mild local reactivity at the injection site. a trial using a DNA vaccine for tumor therapy was conducted in 1998. optimization strategies for the design of DNA vaccines are presented. the biggest challenge is the low immunogenicity of DNA vaccines in humans. the biggest challenge is the low immunogenicity of DNA vaccines in larger animals. antigen and a molecular adjuvant are encoded by expression vectors. both sequences must be incorporated in the DNA vaccine (in cis) the vector backbone comprises the part of the DNA vaccine which is not required for eukaryotic expression. transgenic mice engineered to express antigens under transcriptional control of a large 5.5 kb promoter fragment showed DC-specific transgene expression. however, when mice were biolistically transfected with a DNA vaccine containing this CD11c promoter fragment insufficient CTL activation was observed. iviral reporter expression vector under control of the Dectin-2 promotor resulted in reporter expression in LC as well as macrophages [62]. the DC-STAMP promoter was identified as most potent to induce antigen-specific T cell responses in vitro after transfection of DC. the highly conserved actin-bundling protein Fascin-1 is highly expressed in neuronal cells. antigens expressed by tumor cells, so called tumor-associated antigens (TAA) can be divided into two categories: tumor-specific shared antigens and tumor-specific unique antigens. a major risk of using shared TAA is the induction of autoimmune responses. target antigen is of non-human origin, and can strongly enhance antigen expression. if immunogenic peptides of an antigen are known, only sequences encoding relevant antigen epitopes may be included. this problem is addressed by introducing epitope-specific changes in the antigen to increase MHC affinity to T cell receptors. antigen-encoding vaccines have been coadministered with established adjuvants like aluminium salt-based Alum [82] or immunostimulatory CpG oligonucleotides. cytosolic DNA sensors that mediate activation of the stimulator of interferon genes signaling pathway contribute to the intrinsic adjuvant effect of DNA vaccines. Luc and co-workers immunized mice with an influenza protein encoding DNA vaccine and a plasmid encoding the virus-induced signaling adaptor protein. only combined coadministration of Tak1 and Tram expression vectors enhanced CLT responses in vivo. the strategies aim to enhance the activation state of transfected APC. a fusion construct of a Mycobacterium antigen and IL-15 applied intramuscularly into mice yielded pronounced NK activity, an enhanced Th1 and CTL response as well as elevated antibody titers. a fusion construct of a Mycobacterium antigen and IL-15 applied intramuscularly into mice yielded pronounced NK activity, an enhanced Th1 and CTL response. bicistronic vectors are available which enable expression of both (or more) genes in cis. bicistronic vectors are available which enable expression of both (or more) genes in cis. bicistronic vectors are available which enable expression of both (or more) genes in cis. an endogenous protease mediates posttranslational cleavage of the different transgenes. a cell type-specific promoter may allow to restrict antigen expression to APC. the use of cell type-specific promotors may allow to restrict antigen expression to APC. transgenic mice engineered to express antigens under transcriptional control of a large 5.5 kb promoter fragment showed DC-specific transgene expression. however, when mice were biolistically transfected with a DNA vaccine containing this CD11c promoter fragment insufficient CTL activation was observed. transduction of mice with a lentiviral reporter expression vector resulted in reporter expression in LC as well as macrophages [62]. the DC-STAMP promoter was identified as most potent to induce antigen-specific T cell responses in vitro after transfection of DC. transcriptional targeting of DC is intended to restrict antigen and adjuvant expression to this APC population. however, transcriptional targeting of DC will also exclude expression of (protein) antigen in B cells. additional B cell addressing may be achieved by employment of cellular promoters that display activity also in this APC population. codon optimization is mostly needed if the target antigen is of non-human origin. if immunogenic peptides of an antigen are known, only sequences encoding relevant antigen epitopes may be included. this problem is addressed by introducing epitope-specific changes in the antigen to increase MHC affinity to T cell receptors. antigen-encoding vaccines have been coadministered with established adjuvants like aluminium salt-based Alum [82] or immunostimulatory CpG oligonucleotides to stimulate APC. codelivery of plasmids that encode transcription factors as genetic adjuvants has been tested to stimulate APC. Luc and co-workers immunized mice with an influenza protein encoding DNA vaccine and a plasmid encoding the virus-induced signaling adaptor protein. only combined coadministration of Tak1 and Tram expression vectors enhanced anti-viral T cell responses in vivo. IL-15 exerts broad stimulatory effects on effector CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells, NK cells as well as DC. a fusion construct of a Mycobacterium antigen and IL-15 applied intramuscularly into mice yielded pronounced NK activity, an enhanced Th1 and CTL response as well as elevated antibody titers. expression vectors that encode cytokines or chemokines are clinically tested. so far, DNA vaccines that integrate both the antigen expression unit and a molecular adjuvant into a single plasmid have been tested in limited number of studies only. a virus-derived T2A sequence was introduced instead of a virus-derived peptide sequence. this peptide sequence is recognized by an endogenous protease. it mediates posttranslational cleavage of the different transgenes. it is important to use a cell type-specific promoter for transfection. NC are used predominantly as delivery systems for drugs, adjuvants or nucleic acid-based vaccines contributing to the emerging field of nano-vaccines. the exact mode of interaction of NC with a cell membrane is strongly influenced by the size, charge, shape, and hydrophilic/hydrophobic surface properties of the former. the exact mode of interaction of NC with a cell membrane is strongly influenced by the size, charge, shape, and hydrophilic/hydrophobic surface properties of the the development of new NC-based delivery systems stirred up hope in the field of gene therapy for cancer treatment [138] the field of nanomaterials is still emerging resulting in new designs that open new opportunities for use like the development of virus-like particles (VLP) and magnetic particles which may be directed in vivo by applying magnetic fields [147] and the introduction of tumor microenvironment-triggered drug release mechanisms [148] the delivery system has to show stability against serum proteins that may form a protein corona around the NC. after uptake by the cell, the NC cargo has to evade endo/lysosomal degradation and to enter the cytoplasm by endosomal escape. Graphene oxide is a compound consisting mainly of carbon and oxygen with a layer structure. it protects nucleic acids from cleavage, making it a very remarkable candidate for gene therapy. carbon nanotubes (CNT) are small and chemically inert. cationic liposomes show great binding of DNA and the forming liposomes protect their cargo from degradation. cationic liposomes show great binding of DNA and the forming liposomes protect their cargo from degradation. liposomes can encapsulate protein antigens and are commonly used as adjuvant delivery systems. albumin is generated by the liver and constitutes the most abundant serum protein [183] cationic polymeric nanomaterials are cheap, non-immunogenic, safe and have a greater DNA-loading capacity than viruses. cationic polymeric nanomaterials are cheap, non-immunogenic, safe and have a greater DNA-loading capacity than viruses. cationic polymers are very effective in condensing it to form structures resembling viruses. polymeric structures achieved a milestone in 1988 as the first receptor targeted transfections were performed. in early approaches inactivated adeno- and rhino- [203] viruses were used in combination with receptor targeting polyplexes. polyamidoamine dendrimers were shown to exert a prominent proton sponge effect as the amines are only slightly protonated at neutral pH. PEI is not biodegradable and shows high toxic effects in a molecular weight-dependent manner. cationic polymers in general can be recognized by the immune system and were shown to trigger complement activation.

'bacterial ghosts' which constitute only the bacterial envelope have been introduced as carriers for DNA vaccines. biolistic transfection as mediated by gene gun and PMED. microneedles which are produced from various materials and techniques display lenghts below one micron [238] and tattooing devices address these cell types as well. intramuscular administration followed by electroporation at the injection side. EP is frequently used to increase the overall transfection efficiency at the injection site. rhesus macaques were shown to efficiently enhance immune responses. ligands or antibodies specific for endocytically active receptors strongly expressed on APC may enable cell type-focussed targeting [251] such moieties may be coupled to naked DNA or DNA complexing NC. vaccination of mice with a mannosylated cationic liposome resulted in improved immune responses in mice [255] DNA vaccine should include a promoter that promotes activation of the transfected APC to prevent antigen-specific tolerance induction. several types of NC bear intrinsic immunostimulatory activity, and the mode of DNA delivery may also result in local inflammation. both factors need to be considered since they contribute to shape the character of the induced immune response."}
