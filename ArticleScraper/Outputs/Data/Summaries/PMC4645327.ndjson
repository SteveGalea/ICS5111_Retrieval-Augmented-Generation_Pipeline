{"summary": "SARS-CoV is an enveloped virus with a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome of roughly 30,000 nucleotides encoding four structural proteins. SARS-CoV entry into the cell is mediated by S-protein binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the cell surface (4). analysis of ORF7a evolution during the SARS-CoV outbreak showed the ORF7a-dependent induction of apoptosis in a caspase-dependent pathway. the data suggest that ORF7a is vital for SARS-CoV biology and has a yet unknown role in pathogenesis and disease. iency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is tethering budding virions to the host cell. BST-2 is thought to restrict virus release by physically tethering the budding enveloped virion to the plasma membrane. a number of mechanism models have been proposed (28, 29) BST-2 include Chikungunya virus nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1), Ebola virus glycoprotein GP1,2, herpes simplex virus glycoprotein M, HIV-2 envelope glycoprotein, sendai virus glycoproteins, and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) Nef and envelope glycoproteins (23\u201326, 35\u201338) icSARS-CoV and SARS-CoV with an ORF7ab deletion (icSARS-ORF7ab-CoV) were constructed using the SARS-CoV infectious clone (icSARS-CoV) as previously described. all virus stocks were stored at 80\u00b0C until they were ready to use. the nonstructural proteins were cloned into the pCAGGS-green fluorescent protein (GFP) or pCAGGS-hemagglutinin (HA) vector for expression in HEK293T cells. amplicons and vector were digested with EcoRI/XmaI fragments for cloning. 4 5\u2032-GATCGAATTCACCATGAAGATTGTTAGTTAGTTAGTTAGTTAGTTAGTTAGTTAGTTAGTTAGTTAGTTAGTTAGTTAGTTAGTTAGTTAGTTAGTTAGTTAGTTAGTTAGTTAGTTAGTTAGTTAGTTAGTTAGTTAGTTAGT-3\u2032 5\u2032-GATCCCCGGGCTGTTAGTTAGTTAGTTAGT-3\u2032 nsp8 5\u2032-GATCGAATTCACCATGA HEK293T/ACE2 cells were transfected with icSARS-CoV or icSARS-GFP-CoV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1. the supernatant was taken at 12, 24, and 36 h postinfection. RNA was isolated from cells that had been infected with SARS-CoV for 24 h using the TRIzol reagent (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. levels of SARS-CoV pp1a mRNA (forward primer, GCCGTAGTGTCAGTATCATCACC; reverse primer, AATAGGACCAATCTCTGTAAGCC) were quantified using the CT threshold cycle (CT) method. infected Vero E6 cells were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde at 24 h postinfection. cells were postfixed in 1.0% osmium tetroxide (Electron Microscopy Sciences), stained en bloc with 2.0% uranyl acetate. Embedded blocks were sectioned using a Leica UC7 ultramicrotome. lysate was combined with 2 Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) for inhibition experiments, cells were transfected. medium was replaced with 20 nM concanamycin A (ConA; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), or 500 nM MG-132 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) deglycosylation was performed using glycopeptidase F (TaKaRa, Mountain View, CA) the ratio of glycosylated to unglycosylated proteins was calculated by measuring the density of the bands with ImageJ software. all of the transfection experiments were repeated at least two times. the eluate was combined with 2 Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) before boiling and electrophoresis using mini-protean TGX gels. protein levels were assessed using rabbit anti-HA antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and mouse anti-Flag M2 antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) cells were washed using wash buffer (PBS, 1% BSA, 0.05% NP-40) and stained for protein expression. cells were then washed with wash buffer 3 times and a final time with PBS for 30 min at room temperature. HEK293T cells were transfected with BST-2 and ORF7a. cells were washed in HEK293T medium to inactivate trypsin. cells were then washed, resuspended in FACS buffer. data were analyzed using LSRII flow cytometer. cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 2,000 rpm for 2 min, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min, then washed with 10% FBS in PBS and pelleted as described above. samples were divided into 2 aliquots and then blocked with 10% FBS in PBS or blocked with 10% saponin in 10% FBS in PBS for 30 min. cells, 12 M BST-2 expressed in Escherichia coli cells, and 8 M ORF7a-Fc expressed in HEK239T cells were recorded at wavelengths ranging from 200 to 260 nm in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer. CD melting curves were analyzed at 222 nm by increasing the temperature by 1\u00b0C/min starting at 20\u00b0C. the extracellular domain (residues 47 to 161) of BST-2 was also cloned into the plGplus vector (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) the resulting protein includes a C-terminal His6-Flag tag. due to the stop codon carried by the protein, the protein was not expressed as an Fc fusion protein. icSARS-CoV and SARS-CoV with an ORF7ab deletion (icSARS-ORF7ab-CoV) were constructed using the SARS-CoV infectious clone (icSARS-CoV) as previously described (41, 42) all virus stocks were stored at 80\u00b0C until they were ready to use. the nonstructural proteins were cloned into the pCAGGS-green fluorescent protein (GFP) or pCAGGS-hemagglutinin (HA) vector for expression in HEK293T cells. amplicons and vector were digested with EcoRI/XmaI fragments for cloning.

RNA was isolated from cells that had been infected with SARS-CoV for 24 h using the TRIzol reagent (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. levels of SARS-CoV pp1a mRNA were quantified using the CT threshold cycle (CT) method. infected cells were infected with icSARS-CoV or icSARS-GFP-CoV. cells were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde at 24 h postinfection. after fixation for 72 h, the preserved cells were postfixed in 1.0% osmium tetroxide. cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.6], 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% SDS, 5 mM EDTA, 1 protease inhibitor tablet) lysate was combined with 2 Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) before boiling and electrophoresis using mini-protean TGX gels. 100 ng of a plasmid carrying BST-2 and 400 ng of a control plasmid were collected. expression was analyzed as described above at 4, 8, 12, and 16 h. all of the transfection experiments were repeated at least twice. the extract was then washed twice with lysis buffer and eluted using 0.1 M glycine (pH 3.5) the eluate was combined with 2 Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) before boiling and electrophoresis using mini-protean TGX gels. protein levels were assessed using rabbit anti-HA antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and mouse anti-Flag the cells were washed using wash buffer (PBS, 1% BSA, 0.05% NP-40, 2% normal goat serum) for 15 min at room temperature. the cells were then washed with wash buffer 3 times and a final time with PBS for 30 min at room temperature. the slides were analyzed using a Zeiss LSM. HEK293T cells were transfected with BST-2 and ORF7a. cells were washed in HEK293T medium to inactivate trypsin. cells were then washed, resuspended in FACS buffer. data were analyzed using imageJ software (TreeStar, Ashland, OR) cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 2,000 rpm for 2 min, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min, and then washed with 10% FBS in PBS and pelleted as described above. samples were divided into 2 aliquots and then blocked with 10% FBS in PBS or blocked/permeabilized with 10% saponin in 10% FBS in PBS for 30 min. 10 M BST-2 expressed in HEK293T cells, 12 M BST-2 expressed in Escherichia coli cells, and 8 M ORF7a-Fc expressed in HEK239T cells were recorded at wavelengths ranging from 200 to 260 nm in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer. CD melting curves were analyzed at 222 nm by increasing the temperature by 1\u00b0C/min starting at 20\u00b0C. the extracellular domain (residues 47 to 161) of BST-2 was also cloned into the plGplus vector (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) the resulting protein includes a C-terminal His6-Flag tag and was not expressed as an Fc fusion protein. the genomes of many enveloped viruses encode proteins that counteract BST-2 (24, 27, 37) four SARS-CoV proteins altered BST-2 expression or the BST-2 molecular mass. icSARS-ORF7ab-CoV shows defects in replication compared to icSARS-CoV replication when BST-2 is overexpressed. a virus with the ORF7ab double deletion was used for the infection experiments. icSARS-CoV replicated to 7.37 104 PFU/ml and 4.80 104 PFU/ml at 24 and 36 h. in BST-2-transfected cells, icSARS-ORF7ab-CoV replicated to significantly lower titers of 4.00 103 PFU/ml and 1.10 104 PFU/ml (P 0.001) at 24 and 36 h. BST-2 does not affect pp1a mRNA or SARS-CoV N mRNA. the defect in icSARS-ORF7ab-CoV replication is due to direct tethering of HIV-1 virions to the plasma membrane. BST-2 transfection showed a much greater effect on icSARS-ORF7ab-CoV. a large amount of virions was found at the plasma membrane. the increased effect of BST-2 on icSARS-ORF7ab-CoV suggests that ORF7a acts as an inhibitor of BST-2-mediated restriction of SARS-CoV. increased amounts of ORF7a cotransfected with BST-2 led to decreased levels of BST-2 expression and lower-molecular-mass products. this suggests that the BST-2 protein is affected by ORF7a expression. untransfected cells showed little to no expression of surface BST-2. lysosomal and proteasomal inhibitors do not affect BST-2 antagonism by ORF7a. lysosomal and proteasomal inhibitors do not affect BST-2 antagonism. lysosomal and proteasomal inhibitors do not affect BST-2 antagonism. h posttransfection replaced the medium with medium containing either 20 nM concanamycin A or 500 nM MG-132. at 18 h posttransfection, the cells were lysed and analyzed by Western blotting to determine if BST-2 was degraded. after treatment, lower-molecular-mass bands were still observed. icSARS-ORF7ab-CoV is more susceptible to BST-2 restriction. icSARS-ORF7ab-CoV is more susceptible to BST-2 restriction. we hypothesize that BST-2 may alter the ORF7a localization within the cell. SARS-CoV ORF7a coimmunoprecipitates with BST-2. at 18 h posttransfection the cells were lysed. we immunoprecipitated proteins from the transfected cells. the direct interaction between ORF7a and BST-2 is regulated by BST-2 glycosylation. we performed surface plasmon resonance analysis of ORF7a\u2013BST-2 binding. affinity can then be calculated from changes in the number of resonance units (RU) purified BST-2 expressed in E. coli and HEK293T cells was stained with Coomassie blue. the BST-2 expressed in HEK293T cells has a lower molecular mass than the BST-2 expressed in HEK293T cells. the binding of ORF7a to unglycosylated BST-2 was at least 4 times weaker than that to unglycosylated BST-2. we hypothesized that ORF7a may bind to BST-2 before it is glycosylated in the ER and interfere with the glycosylation of BST-2. cotransfection of ORF7a leads to decreased levels of unglycosylated BST-2. as levels of ORF7a increase, the levels of glycosylated BST-2 decrease. these data suggest that ORF7a interferes with the glycosylation of BST-2. we transfected HEK293T/ACE2 cells with a mutant of BST-2 (called BST-2 N65A/N92A) that does not undergo N-linked glycosylation (29) the mutant was still able to localize to the cell surface by quantifying the amount of WT and mutant BST-2 on nonpermeabilized cells by flow cytometry. HEK293T ACE2 cells were transfected with either a control plasmid or a plasmid carrying wild-type HA-tagged BST-2 or a mutant HA-tagged BST-2 containing the N65A and N92A mutations. the expression levels of wild-type BST-2 and N65A/N92A BST-2 were analyzed by Western blotting. the genomes of many enveloped viruses encode proteins that counteract BST-2. we hypothesize that the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV may also inhibit BST-2 function. four SARS-CoV proteins altered BST-2 expression or the BST-2 molecular mass. hek293T/ACE2 cells do not express endogenous BST-2. icSARS-CoV replicated to 1.10 105 PFU/ml, while in BST-2-expressing cells, icSARS-CoV replicated to significantly lower titers of 3.43 104 PFU/ml. icSARS-CoV and icSARS-ORF7ab-CoV infection of cells with and without BST-2 expression. at 24 h posttransfection, HEK293T/ACE2 cells were infected with icSARS-CoV (A) or icSARS-ORF7ab-CoV (B) at an MOI of 0.1. supernatants were taken at 12, 24, and 36 h postinfection. defect in icSARS-ORF7ab-CoV replication is due to direct tethering of SARS-CoV virions to the plasma membrane. the defect is due to direct tethering of HIV-1 virions to the plasma membrane. icSARS-ORF7ab-CoV was more susceptible to BST-2 restriction. BST-2 on icSARS-ORF7ab-CoV suggests ORF7a acts as an inhibitor of BST-2-mediated restriction of SARS-CoV. at 24 h postinfection, cells were fixed and imaged by electron microscopy. transfection of BST-2 results in a large increase in the amount of icSARS-ORF7ab-CoV virions retained at the surface compared to that for control transfected cells. untransfected cells showed little to no expression of surface BST-2. cells transfected with BST-2 alone were 88.2% positive for surface BST-2 expression. increasing amounts of ORF7a had no effect on surface expression of BST-2. lysosomal or proteasomal inhibitors could block BST-2 antagonism by ORF7a (32\u201334) concanamycin A and MG-132 treated cells and assayed for ubiquitin and LC3B levels by Western blotting. lysosomal or proteasomal inhibitors could block BST-2 antagonism. the 2 lanes on the far right in Fig. 4C contain a background band with a molecular mass similar to that of HA-tagged ORF7a that did not affect the experiment. these data demonstrate that the appearance of lower-molecular-mass bands of BST-2 is not due to lysosomal or proteasomal degradation and suggest that ORF7a antagonizes BST-2 through an alternative mechanism. HEK293T cells were transfected with BST-2, ORF7a, or both. ORF7a localizes to the ER and was also detectable in the ER. a protein that passes through the ER to the golgi apparatus was detected. transfected BST-2 and ORF7a were transfected into HEK293T cells. at 18 h posttransfection the cells were lysed and analyzed by Western blotting. we found that BST-2 and ORF7a were present in both the input and the coimmunoprecipitate. ORF7a with an Fc fusion tag (ORF7a-Fc) was expressed and purified from HEK293T and HEK293T cells. BST-2 was expressed and purified from both HEK239T and HEK293T cells. tetrameric BST-2 expressed in E. coli had a slightly lower melting temperature of 61.95\u00b0C than dimeric BST-2 expressed in HEK293T cells. HEK293T cells, 12 M BST-2 expressed in E. coli cells, and 8 M ORF7a-Fc expressed in HEK239T cells (E) are shown. for SPR experiments, ORF7a-Fc was captured via protein A immobilized on a CM5 chip. single-cycle kinetics were performed by injection of 5 M, 10 M, 20 M, 40 M, and 80 M BST-2. ORF7a-dependent BST-2 antagonism is unaffected by lysosomal or proteasomal inhibitors. we hypothesized that ORF7a may bind to BST-2 before it is glycosylated in the ER and interfere with the glycosylation of BST-2. previous studies have shown that treatment with glycopeptidase F removes all the glycosylation from BST-2. BST-2 was transfected into HEK293T/ACE2 cells with increasing amounts of ORF7a. at 18 h posttransfection, cells were lysed and analyzed by Western blotting. to confirm that the lower-molecular-mass band was unglycosylated BST-2, we treated the lysate from BST-2-transfected cells with glycopeptidase F. surface labeling showed that mutant BST-2 expression on the plasma membrane was not significantly different from WT BST-2 surface expression. we transfected cells with plasmids carrying WT and N65A/N92A mutant BST-2 and then infected those with icSARS-CoV or icSARS-ORF7ab-CoV. however, there was no significant difference in the levels of icSARS-CoV Urbani and icSARS-ORF7 HEK293T ACE2 cells were transfected with each plasmid and infected with either icSARS-CoV or icSARS-ORF7ab-CoV. cells were analyzed by flow cytometry with an anti-HA antibody. the inhibition of BST-2 is not by protein degradation but by inhibition of its activity through the inhibition of glycosylation at two key sites on the protein that are required for its antiviral function. we demonstrate that a BST-2 mutant protein in which the two glycosylation sites are removed still traffics to the plasma membrane. BST-2 is potentially binding newly released SARS-CoV virions at the plasma membrane. but most models of BST-2 function predict that BST-2 is inserted into the membrane as the virion forms (20), so we would predict that BST-2 is inserted into the membrane as the virion forms. GP1,2 does not remove BST-2 from the surface but antagonizes BST-2 through an as yet unknown mechanism (39). the diverse mechanisms of known BST-2 antagonists demonstrate that viruses have evolved many different ways of antagonizing BST-2."}
