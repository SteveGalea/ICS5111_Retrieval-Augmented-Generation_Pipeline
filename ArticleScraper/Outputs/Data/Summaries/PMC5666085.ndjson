{"summary": "the study of disease emergence has moved from making lists of emerging diseases to establishing more rigorous quantitative frameworks to explain how new infections become established in populations. the study of disease emergence is often synonymous with the study of virus evolution, such that the more we understand about patterns and processes of evolutionary change, the more accurate any emergence prediction is thought to be. emergence must be based on a correct and rigorous understanding of how viruses jump between hosts and adapt to new transmission cycles. if the goal is to develop a meaningful predictive model of disease emergence, there may be considerable value in tuning out the background \u2018noise\u2019 of virus evolution rather than building the model around long-term evolutionary processes. endemic virus infections in humans resulted from cross-species transmission. hepaciviruses are being increasingly documented in animal populations. the true reservoir species for human hepatitis C virus has yet to be identified. emergence should always be thought of as a combination of successful genetics aligned with permissive ecology. emergence risk has been associated with factors such as climate change, population demographics and geographical \u2018hotspots\u2019 of former emergence locations. emergence risk has been associated with such factors as climate change, population demographics and host plasticity. a more ambitious scheme was established in 2016 in the guise of the Global Virome Project (GVP) the GVP will perform large-scale metagenomic surveys of viruses in vertebrate populations. the underlying logic is that knowing what viruses are present in nature provides substantive value in trying to determine what will come next. ICTV recognizes 4404 virus species in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. this means 99.9949379% of the virosphere remains unclassified. the idea of a virosphere so expansive is supported by the vast numbers of viruses discovered by recent studies of viral biodiversity that have been stimulated by advances in metagenomics. the more we sample animal populations, the less frequently virus cross-species transmission to humans seems to occur. however, the more we sample animal populations, the less frequently virus cross-species transmission to humans seems to occur. both Mexico and Saudi Arabia appear as \u2018cold\u2019 spots in these emergence maps, with relatively little evidence of past disease emergence. however, biodiversity has also been linked to a decrease in disease risk through the \u2018dilution effect\u2019. studies of the frequency with which different virus families are able to jump species boundaries also offer little predictive power. phylogenetic studies also show that virus\u2013host associations, including cross-transmission, may extend over many millions of years, as is assumed in studies of virus emergence. there are so many viruses in nature that trying to determine which will ultimately appear in a new host from diversity sampling alone is almost certainly futile. the nature of the central selective processes shaping virus evolution (i.e. antigenic drift) is well known and to some extent quantifiable over the time scale studied. this is demonstrably not when considering unknown emerging viruses. taxonomic span covered by viral families may have taken millions of years to generate and not the scale of years necessary for effective pandemic prediction. phylogenies can be used to accurately describe both macro- and micro-evolution, and superficially appear similar. trees at these two scales are produced by markedly different evolutionary processes. cross-species transmission occurs every 30 million years. the rate of host jumping is 10 000 times more frequent, occurring once every 3000 years. this is far too broad a time scale to provide meaningful predictive value for the study of human disease emergence. the cross-species transmission and emergence of a virus in a new host can be envisioned as a simple form of the adaptive process. the ecological factors that dictate whether such an emergence event will be successful are directly analogous to the random sampling effects that necessarily impact the spread of any new allele in a population. mutations that are beneficial in this host also probably decrease fitness in the reservoir host species. genetic variants are subjected to stronger opposing selection between reservoir and recipient hosts. genetic drift will reduce sampling of the fittest virus and decrease probability of emergence. the more severe the population bottleneck, the less natural selection will be able to optimize viral fitness at the epidemiological scale. despite the insights provided by this population genetic framework, the vastness of the unknown virosphere means that all such theories of emergence are probably of more use in predicting the population impact of emergence rather than predicting what might emerge next. a virus discovered in humans can replicate in that host, which will not be the case for myriad viruses identified through biodiversity surveys of other animal taxa. we urge regular genomic surveillance at the fault-line of disease emergence that captures this human\u2013animal interface. accelerating environmental and anthropogenic changes are expanding the human\u2013animal interface. the study of virus evolution has revealed much about the nature of virus emergence and its history over evolutionary time scales. however, a focus on virus evolution may in fact be a distraction when it comes to predicting the next virus pandemic. a focus on virus evolution may be a distraction when it comes to predicting the next virus pandemic. authors' contributions J.L.G. and E.C.H. jointly conceived and wrote the paper. both authors gave final approval for publication."}
