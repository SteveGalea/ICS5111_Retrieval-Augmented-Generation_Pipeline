{"summary": "in the past ten years, new outbreaks of PED have caused serious economic losses to their swine industry. the etiological agent is porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a member of the Coronaviridae family, is a single-stranded positive sense RNA virus. iTRAQ labeling coupled with liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to analyze whole cell changes in jejunum of piglets infected with a highly virulent PEDV strain YN13 and its cell-adapted strain YN144. the absence of PEDV was confirmed by real time PCR (RT-PCR) based on the M gene of PEDV. piglets were randomly divided into three groups: the YN13-infected group, YN144-infected group, and the control group. after three days of acclimation, piglets were orally inoculated with 4.22 mL of PEDV YN13 and YN144 strains. sections of different tissues of 2\u20133 m were cut for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. sections of about 4 m thickness were prepared, and microwave treated in 10 mM sodium citrate solution (pH 6.0) for antigen retrieval. the cDNA was obtained by RT-PCR using the PrimescriptTM RT Master Mix (TakaRa, Tokyo, Japan) the real-time RT-PCR assay used the following primer and probe sequences. the protein samples from the control group, YN144-infected group, and YN13-infected group were labeled with iTRAQ 113 or iTRAQ 114, iTRAQ 115 or iTRAQ 116, and iTRAQ 119 or iTRAQ 121. the labeled digests were then pooled and vacuum-dried. MS spectra were acquired across the range of 400\u20131250 m/z in high resolution mode (>30,000) a maximum of 20 precursors per cycle were chosen for fragmentation from each MS spectrum with 100 ms minimum accumulation time for each precursor. iTRAQ modification of peptide/protein identification and quantification was also performed with the ProteinPilot software version 4.5. resulting data set was auto bias-corrected to eliminate any variation due to unequal mixing. protein quantification data with a fold change of >2 and 0.5 and p-value 0.05 was selected as the significantly differently expressed protein (DEP) animal and Virus Strains Twelve piglets were purchased from a farm without any history of PED. the antibody free to PED was confirmed by a PEDV ELISA Kit. the absence of PEDV was confirmed by real time PCR (RT-PCR) based on the M gene of PEDV. the piglets in the control group were mock-inoculated with 4.22 mL of PEDV YN13 and YN144 strains. all piglets were euthanized and necropsied when diarrhea was observed in the piglets. biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG (BOSTER, Wuhan, China) was used to detect the primary antibody. antigen-antibody complexes were detected with streptavidin-biotin complex (SABC) kit (BOSTER, Wuhan, China) the PCR was performed using 50 \u00b0C for 2 min, 95 \u00b0C for 10 min, 40 cycles with 95 \u00b0C for 15 s, 56 \u00b0C for 30 s and 72 \u00b0C for 31 s. iTRAQ labeled peptide samples were then redissolved in 200 L buffer. dissolved sample (100 L) passed through high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) before HPLC, Phenomenex columns were balanced with 95% buffer A and 5% buffer B (20 mM HCOONH4, 2 M NaOH, 80% acrylonitrile [CAN], pH 10), for 30 min. a total of 24 fractions were collected. MS/MS data were searched against the Sus scrofa subset database from the UniProt database. paragon algorithm (AB SCIEX) was applied for peptide identification and quantification. Western Blot Analysis Aliquots of sample lysates were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), followed by transferring proteins to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. the membrane was blocked with 5% (w/v) skim milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), at 37 \u00b0C for 2 h, followed by washing three times with TBST pathological changes were found in the small intestine of the virus-infected groups. pathological changes were found in the small intestine of the virus-infected groups. lesions in the small intestine of piglets were more serious than those in the YN144-infected group. PEDV could only be detected in the gastric mucosa, epithelium, gastric submucosa, intestinal epithelial cells, crypt epithelial cells, and intestinal glands of the small intestine. for the same tissue, more positive signals were detected in the YN13-infected group, but not in the control group. Biological processes, molecular functions and cellular components of all these proteins were analyzed by UniProt and GO database (Supplementary Materials File S2). Biological processes, molecular functions and cellular components of all these proteins were analyzed by UniProt and GO database (Supplementary Materials File S2). network analysis of significantly differently expressed proteins for YN13 and YN144-infected groups. red icons represent significantly upregulated proteins; green icons represent significantly downregulated proteins; white icons represent significantly downregulated proteins. the ratios of these five proteins among the two virus-infected groups were consistent with the data from LC-MS/MS analysis. analysis of MX1, heat shock protein 90 kDa beta member 1 (HSP90B1), Annexin A4 (ANXA4), and Aminopeptidase N (APN) expression level in YN13-infected, YN144-infected, and the control groups. crypt depth ratio (V/C) was also measured to show the stronger pathogenicity of YN13 than YN144. yN13-infected, YN144-infected, and control groups were less than those in the YN144-infected group (p 0.01) more positive signals were detected in the YN13-infected group than in the YN144-infected group. real-time PCR was used to quantify the viral loads in jejunum samples of all piglets. 131 of these proteins were upregulated and 138 were downregulated significantly. protein accession numbers in the Supplementary Materials File S1 were transformed to human protein accession numbers. IPA analysis results for the two groups showed that DEPs could be divided into four functional classifications: diseases and disorders; molecular and cellular functions; physiological system development; and toxicity functions. RNA post-transcriptional modification, developmental disorder, hematological disease (Figure 4E); cancer, immunological disease, organismal injury and abnormalities (Figure 4F); cellular comprise, cellular function and maintenance, cell-to-cell signaling and interaction (Figure 4G); and cellular assembly or drug metabolism (Figure 4H). color shade indicates the magnitude of the change in protein expression. YN13 is a pathogenic PEDV strain causing severe acute diarrhea in piglets. YN144 is an attenuated strain causing no significant clinical signs. a total of 269 and 301 proteins were significantly altered in the jejunum tissues of the piglets inoculated with YN13. in vitro studies have demonstrated that PEDV infection inhibited the interferon signaling by targeted degradation of STAT1. however, no significant change was found in STAT1 and STAT2 in the two PEDV infected groups. ulins in host cells were also found during the infection of porcine circovirus type 2. the alteration of tubulin in this study might be a mechanism for PEDV to coordinate its life cycle in host cells. most HSPs identified in this study were upregulated in the YN13-infected group. hnRNPA1, a RNA binding protein, can bind both the 5\u2032 terminal leader sequence and IG sequence of coronavirus sgmRNA. hnRNPA1 can bind both the 5\u2032 terminal leader sequence and IG sequence of coronavirus sgmRNA. hnRNPA1 was downregulated in the YN144-infected group, suggesting a decrease of the replication of YN144. in this study, eIF4G1 was upregulated in YN13-infected group but downregulated in YN144-infected group. this result shows that YN13 might enhance its replication by upregulating expressed eIF4G, while the downregulation of eIF4G1 may result in inhibiting the replication iTRAQ was used to characterize proteomic changes in jejunums from pigs infected with a highly virulent strain YN13 and its attenuated strain YN144. this is the first quantitative proteomic work on the in vivo responses to PEDV infection. we identified relevant targets for further studies of PEDV pathogenesis. in vitro studies have demonstrated that PEDV infection inhibited the interferon signaling by targeted degradation of STAT1. however, no significant change was found in STAT1 and STAT2 in the two PEDV infected groups. tubulin was involved in the process of coordinating viral entry, replication, assembly, and egress in host cells. most HSPs identified in this study were upregulated in the YN13-infected group, but down-regulated in the YN144-infected group. hnRNPA1, a RNA binding protein, can bind both the 5\u2032 terminal leader sequence and IG sequence of coronavirus sgmRNA. hnRNPA1 can bind both the 5\u2032 terminal leader sequence and IG sequence of coronavirus sgmRNA. hnRNPA1 was downregulated in the YN144-infected group, suggesting a decrease of the replication of YN144. eIF4G1 was upregulated in YN13-infected group but downregulated in YN144-infected group. this result shows that YN13 might enhance its replication by upregulating expressed eIF4G, while the downregulation of eIF4G1 may result in inhibiting the replication of YN iTRAQ combined with LC-MS was used to characterize proteomic changes in jejunums from pigs infected with a highly virulent PEDV strain YN13. this is the first quantitative proteomic work on the in vivo responses to PEDV infection."}
