{"summary": "a growing number of novel -CoVs and -CoVs have been identified in bats of various species, leading to the hypothesis that bats may be the original hosts for recognized mammalian CoVs [9,10,11,12,13,14,15]. from September 2012 to September 2013, 52 deaths occurred among 110 laboratory-diagnosed MERS-CoV patients in the Middle East, Europe, and Africa. a recent study suggests the widespread infection of camelids at different locations in Oman with MERS-CoV. no macroscopic lesions suggesting infectious diseases were observed in any of the bats examined. most revealed dehydration and traumatic injuries, such as lacerations of the wing membrane, bone fractures, haematomas, haemoperitoneum, and haemothorax. most of the coV-positive samples were detected from Kuhl\u2019s pipistrelle. avi\u2019s pipistrelle (one), common noctule (one), lesser horseshoe bat (four), and Pipistrelle bat (Pipistrellus spp.) (one) in table 2, there is a detailed list of positive samples with the GenBank accession number assigned to the gene sequence that tested positive by RT-PCR.

RT-PCR reactions using the 3rd passage cryolysates were also negative. RNA was eluted in 100 L of MV6 elution buffer and stored at 80 \u00b0C. coV screening was performed by a pan-coronavirus one-step RT-PCR method based on degenerate primers. a second RT-PCR was performed to amplify a 440-bp-long fragment of the highly conserved RdRp gene using the primers Corona 1 forward, 5'-GGTTGGGACTATCCTAAGTGTGA-3' and Corona 2 reverse, 5'-CCATCATCAGATAGAATCATCATA-3'. the total length of the amplified fragment was 760 bp. the nucleotide sequences without primer sequences (385 bp) were aligned and compared to 29 selected human and animal CoV sequences available from the GenBank database. the phylogenetic trees were drawn using the Neighbor-joining method using the Maximum composite likelihood model with MEGA 5 software. a limited number of samples were collected directly from known roost sites. genome Detection and Sequencing Faecal and organ samples were homogenized in minimal Essential Medium (MEM, 1 g/10 mL) containing antibiotics and clarified by centrifugation at 3,000 g for 15 min. RNA was eluted in 100 L of MV6 buffer and stored at 80 \u00b0C. RT-PCR products were gel purified and subjected to nucleotide sequence analysis. a second RT-PCR was performed to amplify a 440-bp-long fragment of the highly conserved RdRp gene using the primers Corona 1 forward, 5'-GGTTGGGACTATCCTAAGTGTGA-3' and Corona 2 reverse, 5'-CCATCATCAGATAGAATCATCATA-3' the nucleotide sequences without the primer sequences (385 bp) were aligned and compared to 29 selected human and animal CoV sequences available from the GenBank database. the phylogenetic trees were drawn using the Neighbor-joining method using the Maximum composite likelihood model with MEGA 5 software. the diversity of bat species and some of their unique biological and ecological features allow them to serve as reservoirs for the emergence of new viruses. the recent fatal human infections caused by the novel MERS-CoV has resulted in a new, intense interest in the discovery of CoVs in humans and animals. clade 2c -CoVs (MERS-like CoVs) in vespertilionid bats in Italy were first identified in this study. clade 2c -CoVs from Kuhl\u2019s pipistrelle, common noctule and Savi\u2019s pipistrelle were detected. the genetic characterization of Pipistrellus spp. bats and MERS-CoV revealed a marked sequence divergence in the spike and nucleocapsid proteins of HKU4 and HKU5 strains. the risk of coronavirus infection and respiratory disease in humans remains low, and bats should not be considered liabilities, especially given the vital ecosystem functions they perform."}
