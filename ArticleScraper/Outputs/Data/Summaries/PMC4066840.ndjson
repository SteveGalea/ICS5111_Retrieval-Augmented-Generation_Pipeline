{"summary": "etiology of acute respiratory infections diagnosed as pneumonia is determined in only 75% of the cases. 1 of these identified respiratory pathogens, typically determined with molecular techniques, viruses account for approximately 15% of the infections. 2 Nevertheless, by employing molecular diagnostic techniques in hospitalbased studies, one can typically identify up to 90% of the viral agents associated with respiratory tract infections. we randomly selected a total of 568 stored nasopharyngeal swabs or nasal washes collected in 2007 from children younger than 6 years old. the facilities included in the study were three city hospitals in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in Managua and Masaya, Nicaragua. the thermocycling conditions were as follows: 95\u00b0C for 3 minutes, followed by 45 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 seconds and 60\u00b0C for 1 minute. amplification was performed on any positive realtime PCR samples. all sites had the same median age; however, mean ages were 121 years in Nicaragua (SD: 140), 175 years in Argentina (SD: 145) and 179 years in Peru (SD: 150). a slight predominance in male participants was observed in each of the sites. 185, 192 and 191 individuals from Argentina, Nicaragua and Peru met the inclusion criteria. all sites had the same median age; however, mean ages were 121 years in Nicaragua. forty-five percent of all participants were girls. sixtyone percent of children who tested positive for HBoV were boys, but the gender distribution across sites was not significantly different. the prevalence reported in the original study from Allander et al. was 35% in hospitalized patients in Sweden. HBoV was found in 23% of the samples collected from children with respiratory symptoms, which is somewhat higher to what has been reported previously.
