{"summary": "classical swine fever virus (CSFV) is a highly contagious and often fatal viral disease in pigs. the virus possesses a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 12.3 kb (2, 3) its genome contains a single, large open reading frame that encodes a precursor polyprotein of 3,898 amino acids (aa) the study of cellular receptors can contribute to the understanding of viral entry mechanisms and provide targets for novel antivirals. HS is ubiquitously present on the surface of many cell types and used by various viruses for attachment (12\u201316) the laminin receptor (LamR) is a cellular receptor for CSFV and is responsible for its attachment to the cell. PK-15 cells were transfected with these siRNAs for 48 h in 48-well plates. PK-15 cells grown to 60% confluence were transfected with the siRNAs indicated below at a final concentration of 200 nM in 48-well plates. after 48 h, the cells were infected with 100 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID50) CSFV-NproFluc. a proteoExtract transmembrane protein extraction kit (Merck) was used for membrane extraction. cells were washed with wash buffer and then incubated with extraction buffers I and II. the membrane proteins were dissolved in extraction buffer II. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids carrying the Flag-tagged Erns gene or Flag-tagged E2 gene. the transfected cells were harvested at 48 h posttransfection (hpt), washed three times with cold PBS, and lysed with NP-40 buffer (Beyotime) for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. PK-15 or SK6 cells grown in 24-well plates were incubated with polyclonal antibody (PAb) against LamR or soluble laminin (Sigma) at various concentrations at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. after incubation, the cells were stained with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 15 min. HEK293T cells plated in poly-l-lysine (PLL)-coated 10-cm dishes were transfected with 21 g of pLVX-LamR-shRNA2 and packaging plasmids psPAX2 and pMD2.0G (7 g) at 48 hpt, the culture supernatant was concentrated by centrifugation at 4,500 g for 20 min at 4\u00b0C using an Amicon Ultra-15 centr the concentrated pseudovirus was transduced into PK-15 or SK6 cells in 6-well plates. expression of LamR tagged with enhanced GFP was tested by Western blotting using rabbit anti-LamR PAb (1:1,000; Abcam) inase I (New England BioLabs) washed five times with cold PBS to remove the unbound CSFV. total viral RNA was extracted from CSFV-bound cells using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and treated with DNase I (TaKaRa) the cells were inoculated with 100 TCID50 CSFV-NproFluc on ice. the virus was removed and the cells were washed three times with PBS. the cells were then inoculated with 100 TCID50 CSFV-NproFluc on ice. PK-15 cells grown to 60% confluence were transfected with the siRNAs indicated below at a final concentration of 200 nM for 48 h in 48-well plates. reporter viruses were then infected for another 48 h and assayed for Fluc activity by using a PE Envision system. the supernatants were centrifuged at 1,200 g for 5 min. they were pelleted at 20,000 g for 1 h and resuspended in 8.5% sucrose in TEA buffer. the cells were washed with wash buffer and then incubated with extraction buffers I and II. cells were resuspended with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS. cells were incubated with anti-LamR antibodies (Abcam) for 2 h at 4\u00b0C. followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody for 1 h. cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min. cells were blocked with 5% skimmed milk for 1 h. incubated with homemade anti-Erns and anti-LamR antibodies. cells were stained with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for 15 min. culture medium was collected and titrated as described below. duplexes of synthesized oligonucleotides containing target sequences were inserted into the lentivirus vector pLVX-shRNA2 (Clontech) to generate lentiviruses for short hairpin RNA (shRNA) delivery. HEK293T cells grown in 10-cm dishes were transfected with the plasmid pFUGW-LamR. at 48 hpt, the culture supernatant was concentrated and titrated. the concentrated pseudovirus was transduced into PK-15 or SK6 cells in 6-well plates. cells in 24-well plates were treated with 1,000 mIU heparinase I. the cells were then incubated with CSFV at an MOI of 5 for 2 h. the cells were then washed five times with cold PBS to remove the unbound CSFV. the cells were inoculated with 100 l of the binding buffer containing 100 mIU of heparinase I. the cells were then inoculated with 100 TCID50 CSFV-NproFluc on ice. at different time points postinfection was removed and the cells were washed three times with PBS. expression of the genes for three proteins had a significant impact on CSFV infection (Fig. 1). these membrane proteins were low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr), LamR, and vinculin. a siRNA-mediated knockdown of LamR expression reduced Fluc activity by nearly 90%. results strongly suggested that LamR is critical for CSFV infection. the 67-kDa LamR is likely to be the protein critical for CSFV. we then tested the siRNA with wild-type CSFV of different genogroups and PRV at an MOI of 0.01. all three CSFV strains grew poorly in cells transfected with the siRNA against LamR (siLamR) PK-15 cells were infected with virus at an MOI of 0.01. PK-15 cells were infected with siLamR or siScr molecules. the cells were infected with virus at an MOI of 0.01. njin/10 strain (CSFV-TJ/10; genogroup 2) in cells transfected with siLamR or siScr molecules. cells were infected with virus at an MOI of 0.01. cells were infected with virus at an MOI of 0.01. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing either Flag-tagged Erns (Flag-Erns) or Flag-tagged E2 (Flag-E2) the cell lysate was mixed with membrane or cytoplasm extracts. co-IP was performed using anti-Flag MAb. infected cell culture supernatant was collected at 48 hpi and titrated. PK-15 cells (E) or SK6 cells (F) were preincubated with anti-LamR antibodies or irrelevant rabbit IgG, followed by infection with CSFV or PRV. the inhibition effects were also found to be specific to CSFV. the cells were infected with the indicated virus at an MOI of 1. the supernatant was collected at 24 hpi. bars represent standard deviations. nearly all cells expressed the EGFP-tagged LamR. the 37-kDa LamR with the EGFP tag was detected in both cells. no 67-kDa LamR with the EGFP tag was observed. the expression of LamRpig did not confer onto nonpermissive cells susceptibility to CSFV. it is of interest to investigate whether the expression of LamR from pigs (LamRpig) correlates with susceptibility to CSFV infection. the interaction of LamR with CSFV was necessary for CSFV infection. however, LamR expression did not confer susceptibility to CSFV onto cells of nonpermissive cell lines. to confirm our speculation, we performed attachment assays on cells of two permissive cell lines. HS has already been identified to be an attachment receptor for CSFV. the identification was based on the findings obtained with SK6 cells. the results indicate that there are differences between the two cell lines. SK6 cells may use HS as the main attachment receptor. following removal of HS, CSFV attachment was significantly inhibited. there may be an alternative attachment pathway which is not as efficient as the HS pathway. the relative rate of infection of SK6 and SK6-EGFP cells showed a high similarity to previous results. for SK6-LamR cells, the relative infection rate reached 40% at 30 min and slowly increased to approximately 90% at 120 min. the same treatment was also performed on PK-15, PK-EGFP, and PK-LamR cells. screening showed that knockdown of the expression of the genes for three proteins had a significant impact on CSFV infection (Fig. 1). these membrane proteins were low-density lipoprotein receptor, LamR, and vinculin. the results strongly suggested that LamR is critical for CSFV infection. a 67-kDa LamR correlates with CSFV infection and is likely to be the protein critical for CSFV. we then tested the siRNA with wild-type CSFV of different genogroups and PRV at an MOI of 0.01. all three CSFV strains shared a similar growth profile in cells with LamR knockdown. PK-15 cells were transfected with siLamR or siScr. PK-15 cells were infected with virus at an MOI of 0.01. the cells were infected with virus at an MOI of 0.01. cells were infected with virus at an MOI of 0.01. PK-15 or SK6 cells stably expressing shLamR or shScr. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing either Flag-tagged Erns (Flag-Erns) or Flag-tagged E2 (Flag-E2) the cell lysate was mixed with membrane or cytoplasm extracts. co-IP was performed using anti-Flag MAb. both CSFV and PRV were preincubated with either LamR or BSA. after 24 h, the culture supernatant was collected and titrated. results from both cell lines indicated that CSFV incubated with LamR showed a decreased infection ability correlated with the increased amounts of soluble LamR. PK-15 or SK6 cells were preincubated with anti-LamR PAb. anti-LamR antibodies at a concentration of 5 g/ml markedly blocked the infectivity of CSFV. nearly all cells expressed the EGFP-tagged LamR. the 37-kDa LamR with the EGFP tag was detected in both cell lines. no 67-kDa LamR with the EGFP tag was observed. EGFP-LamR expression in PK-15 cells detected by flow cytometry. expression of LamRpig did not confer onto nonpermissive cells susceptibility to CSFV. it is of interest to investigate whether expression of LamR from pigs correlate with susceptibility to CSFV infection. LamR overexpression in PK-15 cells promoted CSFV attachment to cells. the interaction of LamR with CSFV was necessary for CSFV infection. however, LamR expression did not confer susceptibility to CSFV onto cells of nonpermissive cell lines. HS has already been identified to be an attachment receptor for CSFV. the identification was based on the findings obtained with SK6 cells. the results indicate that there are differences between the two cell lines. the effects of HS seemed to differ in these two cell lines. SK6 cells may use HS as the main attachment receptor. there may be an alternative attachment pathway which is not as efficient as the HS pathway. the relative rate of infection of SK6 and SK6-EGFP cells showed a high similarity to our earlier results. for SK6-LamR cells, the relative infection rate reached 40% at 30 min and slowly increased to approximately 90% at 120 min. the same treatment was performed on PK-15, PK-EGFP, and PK-LamR cells. overexpression of LamR resulted in an increase in binding of virions to permissive and nonpermissive cells. all of the evidence suggests that LamR is a cellular receptor for CSFV and that it functions during attachment. 67-kDa LamR is more abundant, inactive, and stable than its 67-kDa counterpart. a possible explanation is that the 67-kDa LamR is the activated, interconvertible, and functional form of the 37-kDa LamR, which is more abundant, inactive, and stable than its 67-kDa counterpart. the 67-kDa LamR was knocked down, whereas the 37-kDa LamR was slightly or not affected. HS and LamR work as attachment receptors in both PK-15 and SK6 cells. however, the roles of HS and LamR varied from each other. the identification of LamR as a CSFV receptor also raises a number of questions with regard to the entry of CSFV. the receptor(s) acting on the pathway of entry remains undefined. the receptor(s) acting on the pathway of entry remains undefined. only some types of porcine cell lines support CSFV replication. this poses a question: is the receptor or the cellular environment the major limiting factor for CSFV growth?"}
