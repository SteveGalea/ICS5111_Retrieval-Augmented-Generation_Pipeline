{"summary": "crowded and congested environment during Hajj amplifies risks associated with mass gatherings. Neisseria meningitidis is associated with a substantially high rate of carriage (up to 86%) in crowded and closed populations. an intercontinental Hajj-related outbreak of meningococcal serogroup A (MenA) disease led to approximately 2000 cases. the mandatory vaccination policy also applies to residents of Hajj zones and to personnel who serve pilgrims during the Hajj. current preventive measures mandated by the Saudi Arabian government to control meningococcal disease during Hajj. unauthorized domestic pilgrims often enter Hajj sites without a permit and without formally registering with an official Hajj tour group. vaccine coverage was found to be very low (64%) in 2006 in the only published work reporting vaccine uptake among domestic pilgrims. domestic pilgrims in their camps in mina and overseas pilgrims living in hotels/serviced apartments in Aziziyah were eligible to participate. the research team randomly approached tour operators to access their tent camps or housing and invite pilgrims to the study. no identifiable personal data were collected, and respondents\u2019 completion of the survey was considered implied consent. statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSSTM) for WindowsTM v.25.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) participants who were unsure about their vaccination history were excluded from the analysis. study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of King Saud University College of Medicine, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia (E-17-2534). questionnaire collected data on socio-demographic characteristics (such as age, gender, educational level, and employment status), uptake of meningococcal vaccines as a preparation for Hajj and reasons behind non-receipt of the vaccine. participants who were unsure about their vaccination history were excluded from the analysis. a p-value 0.05 was considered statistically significant. the statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSSTM) only 389 (81.7%) confirmed receipt of a meningococcal vaccine. 64 (13.4%), all domestic pilgrims, did not receive the vaccine, and 23 (4.8%) were unsure about their vaccination status. four (6.5%) were unsure, compared with 80.9% (321/397) of domestic pilgrims who received the vaccine (p 0.01), 61/397 (15.3%) who did not, and 15/397 (3.8%) who were unsure. employers were twice as likely to be vaccinated as those who were not employed. those from Makkah province were almost three times more likely to miss out on the vaccine compared to those from other provinces. 1.4 (0.8\u20132.4) 0.24 Tertiary qualification No 122/150 (79.2) 1.0 (ref) Yes 262/297 (88.2) 1.7 (1.0\u20132.5) 0.048 220/254 (86.6) 1.7 (0.97\u20132.98) 0.06 Employed no 113/144 (78.5) 1.0 (ref) 92/121 (76) 1.0 (ref) Yes 269/302 (89.1) 2.2 (1.3\u20133.8) 0.03 226 overseas pilgrims, women, and those who attended Hajj for the first time were significantly more likely to pay for the vaccine. overseas pilgrims, women, and those who attended Hajj for the first time were significantly more likely to pay for the vaccine. 1.0 (ref) No 22/112 (19.6) 1.7 (0.9\u20133.1) 0.09 Employed Yes 32/246 (13) 1.0 (ref) No 21/108 (19.4) 1.6 (0.9\u20133) 0.12 OR, odds ratio; 95% CI, 95% confidence interval; p, p-value; ref, reference value.
