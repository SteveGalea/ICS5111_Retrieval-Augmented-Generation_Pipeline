{"summary": "we define systematic comparative genomics as the systematic comparative genomics and aim to develop the methodology. results first, we create a method, GenomeFingerprinter, to unambiguously produce a set of three-dimensional coordinates from a sequence, followed by one three-dimensional plot and six two-dimensional trajectory projections. we develop a set of concepts and tools, and thereby establish a method called the universal genome fingerprint analysis (UGFA) systematic comparative genomics is based on the geometrical analysis of sequences crossing diverse genetic components and biological categories in the post-genomic era. but even simply visualizing a DNA sequence has been challenging for decades; little progress has been made to date. the most common tools were BLAST [9] and CLUSTALW [10]. the output image showed the BLAST-similarity between one central reference sequence and other inquiry sequences as a set of concentric rings. this tool had great advantages over other common tools, like ACT [12], in terms of the numbers of genomes being simultaneously compared. the Z-curve method (Zplotter program) was used not only for visualization but for geometrical analysis to explore real contexts of biology [18], [19], [20], [21], thus showing it\u2019s promising. however, the Zplotter algorithm had an inevitable flaw to falsely present a genome sequence due to its ambiguous cutting-point error. however, no statistic analysis could be further applied to the outcome dataset. the Z-curve method (Zplotter program) [16] defined a set of coordinates (xn, yn, zn) for each base in a linear sequence (n = 1, 2,..., N; N is the sequence length) by the equation (0), which defined a unique Z-curve for a given linear sequence (n = 1, 2,..., N; N is the sequence length) the RD formula (1) can virtually treat an arbitrary linear sequence as a circular one. a collection of RD values (m = 1, 2,..., N) can be generated for each selected TB (in total N number) sliding along with the given sequence. we have developed an in-house script, GenomeFingerprinter.exe to do all. by using our program GenomeFingerprinter.exe, we can calculate a series of coordinates (xn, yn, zn) for the artificial genome sequence containing 40-bps (Figure 1); there are total 40 bases and each base has its own coordinates (xn, yn, zn) we define such a GF vision as the genome fingerprint map (GFM) for convenience, we further define such a GFM vision of three-dimensional plot as the primary genome fingerprint map (P-GFM) from now on, we can directly operate and compare the GFM vision for comparing sequences. us M.16.4 NC_012726 Chromosome 2586647 Sulfolobus islandicus Y.N.15.51 NC_012623 Chromosome 2812165 Sulfolobus islandicus Y.G.57.14 NC_012622 Chromosome 2702058 Methanococcus voltae A3 NC_014222 Chromosome 1936387 Methanosphaera stadtmanae DSM 30 006396 Chromosome 3176463 Haloarcula marismortui ATCC43049 NC_006397 Chromosome 292165 Haloarcula marismortui ATCC43049 NC_006389 plasmid pNG100 33779 Haloarcula marismortui ATCC43049 NC_006390 plasmid pNG200 33930 Haloarcula marismortui AT Chromosome 2014239 Halobacterium salinarum R1 NC_010364 Chromosome 2000962 Derivatives created in this study [based on those sequences from GenBank] Escherichia coli K-12/W3110-91.1.1 91.1.1 Chromosome fragment 227694 Escherichia coli K-12/W3110-91.1.61 91.1.61 Chromosome fragment 324260 Escherichia coli 947.1.50 Chromosome fragment 470050 Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) pLysSAG-12947.F5 12947.5 Chromosome fragment 1915479 Escherichia coli O55:H7/CB9615-13941.2.60 13941.2.60 Chromosome fragment 267039 Figure 2.

NRC-1 (NC_002607) and Halobacterium salinarum R1 (NC_010364). each individual primary genome fingerprint map (P-GFM) is classified into a discrete group solely based on its location. a given P-GFM vision has quite different views between its own format and that of the UGFM vision. this feature could ensure the UGFM vision to be a powerful tool. universal genome fingerprint analysis (UGFA) consists of concepts and tools under three subcategories corresponding to three objects. the objects of comparison can be one genome sequence, a number of genome sequences crossing genetic components in a strain, or a set of genome sequences. universal genome fingerprint map (UGFM) of the total genetic component configuration (TGCC) can be used to perform the comparison among a set of genomes crossing genetic components within a strain. the UGFM-TGCC tool can be used to perform the comparison among a set of genomes crossing genetic components within a strain. pNG300 (NC_006391), pNG400 (NC_006392), pNG500 (NC_006393), pNG600 (NC_006394), pNG700 (NC_006395) focusing on plasmids (A) and as a universal system (B); the other set (C vs.D): Haloferax vocanii DS2. the UGFM-TGCC-SCG vision can demonstrate the amazing landscape of a large set of genomes crossing diverse genetic components (chromosomes, plasmids, and phages) at large scale, the UGFM-TGCC-SCG vision can demonstrate the amazing landscape of a large set of genomes of interest. for instance, we make up a large set (over one hundred) of genomes of interest by combing 6 archaeal bacterial genomes and 13 arch scale-down and view-angle rotation could ensure as many sequences as possible could be handled at one time as long as the computer memory and graphic software could allot. one set contains eighty three genomes: 24 viruses (I), 12 fragmental chromosomes of E.coli (II) and 47 phages (III), which are shown as three distinct groups (Figure 7, A) Coliphage ID41 NC_007851 Phage chromosome 5737 NC10: Coliphage NC10 NC_007854 Phage chromosome 5687 ID12: Coliphage ID12 NC_007853 Phage chromosome 5687 ID12: Coliphage ID12 NC_007853 Phage chromosome 5687 ID12: Coliphage ID12 NC_007853 Phage chromosome 5687 ID12: Coliphag Enterobacteria phage alpha3 DQ085810 Phage chromosome 6177 WA13: Coliphage WA13 NC_007821 Phage chromosome 6242 phiK: Coliphage phiK NC_001730 Phage chromosome 6263 ID32: Coliphage ID32 NC_007819 Phage chromosome 6245 NC19: Coliphage NC19 NC_007850 Phage chro 40 Phage chromosome 5540 WA10 NC_007842 Phage chromosome 5540 NC51: Coliphage NC51 NC_007839 Phage chromosome 5540 ID45: Coliphage ID45 NC_007831 Phage chromosome 5540 SARS coronavirus TW1 AY283796 Virus chromosome 30137 SARS coronavirus Sin2679 AY283797 Virus chromosome 30132 S the landscape of the UGFM-TGCC-SCG visions at large scale is shown. the twelve bacterial fragmental chromosomes of E.coli (II) and twenty four virus genomes (I) are shown as three distinct groups. the strong effects of scale-down and view-angle rotation at large scale are demonstrated. UGFM, UGFM-TGCC, UGFM-TGCC, and UGFM-TGCC-SCG are effective and powerful in handling such real-world diverse genomes in-one-sitting. this is simply because all genomes of interest crossing diverse genetic components (chromosomes, plasmids, and phages, if applicable) and diverse biological categories (bacteria, archaeal bacteria, viruses) are much less or even no homology at all the geometric center (,,) and the standard deviation of all coordinates (,,) can be calculated (5) by GenomeFingerprinter.exe from a given genome sequence. the definition of has two-fold meanings: one is algebraically calculating the geometric-mean value of the three means (,,) and the other is geometrically defining the side-length value of a cube that is roughly equivalent to the cuboid volume. in general, the differentiate rates () vary from family to family. the values of start from least at strain/species level (50%) to higher at genus level (500%) to even higher at beyond family level (1500%) 88805749.64 439557.42 Methanococcus voltae A3 6408.50 970.50 414491.71 13711.64 25.10 587771.06 23419.60 Methanosphaera stadtmanae 3091 4145.50 7328.50 395302.72 22900.28 1467.93 16494288.43 11236.41 Sulfolobus islandicus Y.N.15.51 78 360470.18 7378.43 1.24 432.16 347.72 Halobacterium sp.NRC-1 851.50 1213.50 360811.68 7197.28 19.19 936045.35 48776.09 Halogeometricum boringquense 11551 2079.00 1844.00 312055.11 10615.71 1.58 275711.29 174157.24 Halomicrobium mukohataei 12286 1900.50 oterrigena turkmenica 5511 3902.00 2238.00 615765.16 17519.47 215.81 200314105.28 928180.28 Halothermothrix orenii H 168 255.00 3329.00 312389.12 6424.66 291.91 126733403.82 434156.90. there are four close strains within the same species, Sulfolobus islandicus. differentiate rates range between 6.42% and 25.28% (Table 3). differentiate rate between UT189 and BL21(DE3) is 321.11%, which is extremely out of the ranges defined by the ordinary members in the same species. it is even much greater than the value of 25.10% between two external genera (Methanococcus voltae A3) in other family. the key step is to create a set of three-dimensional coordinates (xn, yn, zn) for each base in a linear sequence (n = 1, 2,..., N; N is the sequence length) by the equation (0), which defined a unique Z-curve for a given linear sequence. we randomly select a base (the nth) as the first target base (TB) while keep moving the mth focusing base (FB) for the given TB (nth), we define the relative distance (RD) between the selected TB (nth) and the moving FB (mth) (m = 1, 2,..., N) we define the sum of the weighted relative distance (SWRD) (3) from the collection of WRD (m = 1, 2,..., N) for each of four base-type (A, T, G, C), respectively. so far, only one cycle has been done for only one selected TB (nth); namely, only one base has its coordinates (xn, yn, zn) the set of coordinates (xn, yn, zn) of a given sequence can be plotted as a three-dimensional plot (3D-P) to give a geometrical vision. as an example, the artificial sequence (Figure 1) has only 40 points giving a naive vision. instead, we show the real visions of strains from bacteria and archaeal bacteria (Figure 2).

the differentiate rates among different genera vary between 17.10% and 291.91%. 11551 vs. Halomicrobium mukohataei 12286) seem very similar due to the tiny differentiate rate (1.58%) by chance resulting from the very similar values of (10615.71 vs. 10284.83) but they are actually quite different in terms of their geometric centers (2079.00, 1844.00, 312055.11) vs. (1900.50, 1177.50, 486140.66), which are essentially close to the extent that distinguished the method of genome fingerprinting (GenomeFingerprinter), the method of universal genome fingerprint analysis (UGFA), and the method of quantitative analysis (,,,) for the outcome dataset of the genome fingerprint analysis. the method of genome fingerprinting (GenomeFingerprinter), the method of universal genome fingerprint analysis (UGFA), and the method of quantitative analysis (,,,,) is not used for the creation of what we called \u201cgenome fingerprint (GF)\u201d. our method presented a unique circular vision with accurate and delicate genome fingerprints for the same sequence. using the zn, coordinates gave a similar vision to ours, except that it was in an open rough Z-curve with less features. while using the zn' coordinates created a completely different vision from ours. a circular sequence has been proved also valid for a linear sequence. this is not only because the linear form is a specific form of circular one. the formula (1) in our method ensures that our method measures the relative distance in a circular form, rather than the absolute numbers of bases counting from the \u201cfirst\u201d base in a linear sequence. genome fingerprints carry much more sensitive information, considering genome-wide comparative genomics at the genome fingerprint level. our method can precisely calculate a set of three-dimensional coordinates for a given circular or linear sequence with or without correct cutting-point. this can present a stable unique genome fingerprint map and further guarantee the validity of the universal genome fingerprint analysis. the universal genome fingerprint map (UGFM) can intuitively identify the unique genome features such as the genome-wide evolution events and the replication ori points. we then used the Mauve program to pair-wisely compare two chromosomes and confirmed such events (data not shown), demonstrating that the UGFA method could rapidly predict the evolution events while the Mauve program could precisely confirm such predictions. the UGFM-TGCC-SCG tool can handle the exceptional situations for a large set of genomes, but also facilitate the effective integration of the Mauve program into performing systematic comparative genomics. the progressiveMauve mode [14] can be compatible to the UGFA method (including the UGFM, UGFM-TGCC, and UGFM-TGCC-SCG tools), whereas the Mauve mode [15] cannot, but still can be used to partially deal with the subsets we have developed the method of quantitative analysis by using the outcome dataset of genome fingerprint analysis. we have defined the geometric center (,,) and its following geometric mean () of a given genome fingerprint map to determine the Euclidean distance (), the differentiate rate () and the weighted differentiate rate () in order to quantitatively describe the difference between two genomes of comparison. we have only established the method of quantitative analysis to simply compare two genomes in pairs (Table 3). to make intensive statistic analysis about a number of genomes as one sample or two samples, we suggest that a sophisticated method be developed first. UGFM-TGCC, UGFM-TGCC, and UGFM-TGCC-SCG tools have great advantages over conventional methods. we have constructed a method of quantitative analysis to compare two genomes by using the outcome dataset of genome fingerprint analysis. we have demonstrated the applications through case studies on various genome sequences crossing diverse genetic components. GenomeFingerprinter vs. Zplotter 1.1. Validity The Zplotter program [16] is not used for the creation of what we called \u201cgenome fingerprint (GF)\u201d. in fact, some coordinates from the Zplotter program were used to produce hundreds of graphs (as open rough Z-curves) of microbial genomes that were documented as a database [17]. two different cutting-points were incorrectly presented as different visions by using the Zplotter\u2019s coordinates. whereas both scenarios were exactly shown as the same vision by using our method. the reason for such differences come from that the Zplotter program was designed for a linear sequence [16] and its algorithm depends on counting the absolute numbers of bases starting from the \u201cfirst\u201d base in a given linear sequence. the circular and linear forms are genetically and physiologically functioning in a coordinated way for a given genome in a given living microbe. the circular and linear forms are both genetically and physiologically functioning in a coordinated way for a given genome in a given living microbe. the RD formula (1) in our method can virtually treat an arbitrary linear sequence as a circular one. our method presented a unique circular vision with accurate and delicate genome fingerprints for the same sequence. using the zn, coordinates gave a similar vision to ours, except that it was in an open rough Z-curve with less features. the same circular sequence of Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 (NC_002607) was incorrectly presented as different visions by using the Zplotter\u2019s coordinates. the Zplotter program was designed for a linear sequence [16]. it depends on counting the absolute numbers of bases starting from the \u201cfirst\u201d base in a given linear sequence. the same circular sequence with cutting-point error changing its real \u201cfirst\u201d base can result in a quite different vision by using the Zplotter program. the RD formula (1) in our method can virtually treat an arbitrary linear sequence as a circular one (Figure 1). the closed (circular form) genome fingerprints carry much more sensitive information, considering genome-wide comparative genomics at the genome fingerprint level. the RD formula (1) in our method can virtually treat an arbitrary linear sequence as a circular one. more than one hundred genome sequences can be elegantly plotted in-one-sitting. only plotting numerous larger graphics in-one-sitting would cause memory overflow. our method performs calculation and visualization separately. ids with large size range (6 Kbp4 Mbp) belonging to the four strains crossing four genera of halophilic Archaea were mapped only by the progressiveMauve mode [14] whereas the Mauve mode [15] failed in such a comparison because it stopped due to no essential homology. however, the progressiveMauve mode [14] can be compatible to the UGFA method (including the UGFM, UGFM-TGCC, and UGFM more than one hundred genome sequences can be elegantly plotted in-one-sitting. only plotting numerous larger graphics in-one-sitting would cause memory overflow. our method performs calculation and visualization separately, which ensures higher performance efficiency for large genomes. we then used the Mauve program to pair-wisely compare two chromosomes and confirmed such events. the UGFA method could rapidly predict the evolution events while the Mauve program could precisely confirm such predictions. however, the progressiveMauve mode [14] can be compatible to the UGFA method. the UGFA method (including the UGFM, UGFM-TGCC, and UGFM-TGCC-SCG tools) has advantages over the Mauve program [14], [15] in dealing with a set of genomes of less or no homology. we recommend that any components with farther divergence be rapidly pre-screened out by using the appropriate mode of Mauve program [14], [15] genus levels were not within the same range of divergence in terms of the differentiate rates, implying no possibility of setting up a universal boundary for simply distinguishing all taxa. we therefore recommend that the inference based on the differentiate rate and the Euclidean distance be conducted under clear biological contexts. we have developed a method of quantitative analysis to compare two genomes by using the outcome dataset of genome fingerprint analysis. we have defined the geometric center and its following geometric mean () for a given genome fingerprint map, followed by the Euclidean distance () and the weighted differentiate rate () to quantitatively describe the difference. we have demonstrated the applications through case studies on various genome sequences crossing diverse genetic components (chromosomes, plasmids, and phages) and crossing diverse biological categories (bacteria, archaeal bacteria, and viruses) with far divergence over large size range (4 kilo-5 mega-base pairs per sequence), giving tremendous insights into the critical issues in microbial genomics and taxonomy."}
