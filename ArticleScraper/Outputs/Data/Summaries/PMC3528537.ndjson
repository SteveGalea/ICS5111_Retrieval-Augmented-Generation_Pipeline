{"summary": "overexpression of cyclin D1 is common in dysplastic NPE tissue. overexpression of cyclin D1 and EBV-encoded RNA (EBER) could be detected in all of the six cases examined. overexpression of cyclin D1 coexisted with positive EBER staining. in the second column, the dysplastic epithelial cells were EBER+ by in situ hybridization. in the fourth column, overexpression of cyclin D1 was detected in dysplastic epithelium. overexpression of cyclin D1 was detected in the basal and suprabasal layers. CDK4R24C is a dominantly active mutant of CDK4 insensitive to its inhibitor, p16. treatment with 10% (vol/vol) FBS effectively induced growth arrest in all the control hTert-immortalized NPE cell lines. cells overexpressing cyclin D1 or CDK4R24C continued to proliferate in the presence of serum. control and cyclin D1-overexpressing NP550hTert and NP361hTert cells treated with or without FBS treatment. all the control cells eventually lost their proliferative potential after FBS treatment. cyclin D1 pathway could support persistent EBV infection in hTert-immortalized cells. overexpression of cyclin D1 and CDK4R24C and p16 silencing was achieved in NP550hTert or NP361hTert cells. the immortalized NPE cells were plated at a low cell density after EBV infection to observe the appearance of proliferative colonies. hTert-immortalized NPE lines were sorted for GFP+ cells. the cells were plated at a low cell density and were inspected for the appearance of proliferative EBV-infected colonies 21 d after sorting. the morphologies of proliferative EBV-infected colonies were shown. cyclin D1 and CDK4R24C levels were two- or threefold higher in the HA-cyclin D1/CDK4R24C transfectants. these incremental levels of cyclin D1 and CDK4R24C are sufficient to support clonal proliferation of EBV-infected cells. the percentage of EBV-infected cells in hTert-immortalized NPE cell lines dropped rapidly at each passage. the loss of EBV-infected cells may be a result of uninfected cells outgrowing the cells during prolonged culture. a significantly higher percentage of cells expressed SA\u2013galactosidase in the EBV-infected populations than in uninfected cells. growth arrest and cellular senescence are common features of hTert-immortalized NPE cell lines after infection by EBV. at 3, 7, and 14 DPI, cells were trypsinized and sorted into EBV-infected and uninfected populations based on GFP fluorescence. higher SA\u2013galactosidase activity was observed in the cells at 7 and 14 DPI. BrdU incorporation was 4.6-fold higher in NP550hTert cells overexpressing cyclin D1 than in control NP550hTert cells. overexpression of cyclin D1 suppresses EBV-induced growth inhibition and cellular senescence in premalignant cells. enlarged views show perinuclear staining of SA\u2013galactosidase. mean and SDs were calculated from triplicate wells. rate of DNA synthesis was higher in EBV-infected populations. lower transcript levels of EBV lytic genes (BZLF1, BRLF1, BMRF1, and BGLF4) than control NP550hTert cells. expression of LMP1, BZLF1, and viral capsid antigen p18 was observed in only a small subset (3\u20136% at 3 DPI) expression of the EBV-encoded proteins including LMP1, BZLF1 and VCAp18 was examined in control and cyclin D1-overexpressing NP550hTert cells. Means and SDs were calculated from triplicate wells. Western blot analysis also performed to compare the protein levels of LMP1 and BZLF1 in various EBV-infected cell lines. a lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) were included as positive controls for detection of LMP1 and BZLF1 expression by Western blotting. a gradual loss of LMP1 expression in the EBV-infected cells after several rounds of sorting for GFP+. both lines were passaged for more than 18 mo. more than 95% of cells retained the EBV genome. most, if not all, the hybridization signals were obtained on only one chromatid. Western blots showed expression of LMP1 and EBNA1, but not BZLF1. stable EBV-infected lines were established by sorting the cells from NPE cells immortalized by hTert alone. these cell lines were able to retain more than 90% of EBV-infected cells. EBNA1 protein levels were comparable to levels in Akata cells. overexpression of cyclin D1 is common in EBV-infected Dysplastic NPE Tissues. overexpression of cyclin D1 is common in EBV-infected Dysplastic NPE Tissues. representative images of cyclin D1 and LMP1 performed in consecutive sections of three specimens of dysplastic NPE tissue. in the first column, the dysplastic epithelial cells were EBER+ by in situ hybridization. in the fourth column, overexpression of cyclin D1 was detected in dysplastic epithelium. serum is a potent agent commonly used to induce terminal differentiation in culturing epithelial cells. we overexpressed either cyclin D1 or a CDK4 mutant (CDKR24C) in these immortalized NPE cells and examined their responses toward serum-induced differentiation. cells overexpressing cyclin D1 can resist differentiation induced by serum treatment. the proliferative potentials after FBS treatment were much less affected in NP550hTert and NP361hTert cells. primary NP550 cells, which are highly responsive to FBS-induced differentiation, were included as a positive control for involucrin detection. cyclin D1 pathway supports persistent EBV infection in hTert-immortalized cells. western blots confirm exogenous expression of cyclin D1 or CDK4R24C. p16 expression knocked down by shRNA in hTert-immortalized NPE cells. proliferative EBV-infected colonies were sorted for GFP+ cells. ectopic expression of cyclin D1 and CDK4R24C in these cells was confirmed by Western blotting analysis. cyclin D1 and CDK4R24C levels were two- or threefold higher in the HA-cyclin D1/CDK4R24C transfectants. these incremental levels are sufficient to support clonal proliferation of EBV-infected cells. the rates of loss of EBV-infected NP550hTert and NP361hTert cells after infection were monitored. the percentage of EBV-infected cells in hTert-immortalized NPE cell lines dropped rapidly at each passage. EBV-infected NP550hTert cells expressed a higher level of p16. we separated the cells from uninfected cells by FACS at 3, 7 and 14 DPI. in both cell lines, a significantly higher percentage of cells expressed SA\u2013galactosidase in the EBV-infected populations than in uninfected populations. p16 expression was higher in NP550hTert and NP361hTert cells. higher SA\u2013galactosidase activity was observed in the EBV-infected cells than in uninfected cells. senescence induced by EBV infection is reduced almost fourfold in cells overexpressing cyclin D1 compared with control NP550hTert cells. the EBV-infected NP550hTert cells overexpressing or not overexpressing cyclin D1 were examined further for proliferative potential. enlarged views show perinuclear staining of SA\u2013galactosidase. the rate of DNA synthesis was higher in EBV-infected populations. overexpression of cyclin D1 could suppress differentiation in immortalized NPE cells. the cells overexpressing cyclin D1 had higher levels of mRNA transcripts of latent EBV genes (EBER1/2 and EBNA1) but lower transcript levels of EBV lytic genes (BZLF1, BRLF1, BMRF1, and BGLF4) than control NP550hTert cells. the population of BZLF1+ cells ranged from 4\u20136% and appeared to be lower in cells overexpressing cyclin D1 than in control cells. cyclin D1 up-regulated the mRNA transcripts of EBNA1 and EBER1/2. expression of individual EBV genes was normalized to GAPDH expression. expression levels of lytic and latent genes in control NP550hTert cells are indicated as \u201c1\u201d for comparison with gene-expression levels in the cells overexpressing cyclin D1. promoter use was analyzed by semiquantitative PCR. only transcripts derived from the Qp promoter, but not from the Cp promoter, were detected in the EBV-infected NP550hTert cells. stable EBV-infected cell lines were established in NP550hTert and NP361hTert cells overexpressing cyclin D1. both lines were passaged for more than 18 mo. more than 95% of cells retained the EBV genome. Western blots showing the expression of LMP1 and EBNA1 but not BZLF1 in all the stably infected NPE cell lines. HONE1 is a NPC cell line that has lost EBV and contains no EBV genome. stable EBV-infected lines were established by sorting the cells from NPE cells immortalized by combined action of hTert. the number of EBNA1 and LMP1 transcripts was much lower in EBV-infected NPE cell lines than in EBV-infected Akata cells. despite the low transcript level, EBNA1 protein levels in NPE cell lines were comparable to levels in Akata cells. hTert-immortalized cells failed to propagate and were lost rapidly upon serial passages. growth inhibition of hTert-immortalized cells was associated with high levels of p16 and p21, positive expression of SA\u2013galactosidase and lower rates of BrdU incorporation. cyclin D1 may support stable EBV infection in premalignant NPE cells. overexpression of cyclin D1 or aberrant activation of the cyclin D1 pathway may provide advantages supporting stable EBV infection in premalignant NPE cells. all the lytic genes examined, including BZLF1, BRLF1, BMRF1, and BGLF4, were generally down-regulated in EBV-infected NPE cells overexpressing cyclin D1. the lytic promoter Zp, which is crucial in the initiation of EBV lytic reactivation, contains a differentiation-responsive element. Western blot analysis indicated that cyclin D1 overexpression has minimal effects on LMP1 expression in EBV-infected NPE cells. cyclin D1 is detectable in 5% of the cells in both infected cultures. this ruling out a major contribution of LMP1 to enhancing clonal outgrowth of EBV-infected cells overexpressing cyclin D1. several rounds of sorting of EBV-infected populations led to the establishment of stably EBV-infected cell lines. we determined the EBV genome load in NP550hTert+cyclinD1+EBV cells and NP361hTert+cyclinD1+EBV cells using in situ hybridization of fluorescent probes specific for EBV DNA. this amplification may contribute to the persistence of EBV propagation in NPE cells. stable EBV infection in premalignant nasopharyngeal lesions harboring genetic alterations facilitates and promotes malignant transformation of NPE cells. cyclin D1 overexpression also is common in dysplastic NPE tissues and coexists with EBV infection. hTert-immortalized cells were associated with high levels of p16 and p21, positive expression of SA\u2013galactosidase, and lower rates of BrdU incorporation. the induction of growth arrest in EBV-infected NPE cells may be a reason for the infrequent detection of EBV in normal nasopharyngeal epithelium in vivo. the p16 gene is the key inhibitor of the cyclin D1/CDK4 activity. overexpression of cyclin D1 or aberrant activation of the cyclin D1 pathway may provide advantages supporting stable EBV infection in premalignant NPE cells. Lytic gene expression could be detected in upper differentiated layers of the EBV-infected epidermis of oral hairy leukoplakia. suppressive effect of cyclin D1 on differentiation may suppress lytic reactivation of EBV in infected cells. but activation of lytic replication of EBV may not be the main reason for the loss of EBV-infected hTert-immortalized cells in our study. LMP1 expression also diminished in EBV-infected cells upon serial passages. this result may explain why EBV can transform B cells into proliferative LCL cells but induces growth arrest in NPE cells. we determined the EBV genome load in NP550hTert+cyclinD1+EBV cells and NP361hTert+cyclinD1+EBV cells. the high copy number of EBV in both cell lines suggests that the cells amplified the episomal virus genome after infection (36). this amplification may contribute to the persistence of EBV propagation. the immortalized NPE cell lines were established and maintained in a serum-free medium with growth factor supplements. expression of hTert, cyclin D1, or CDK4R24C in primary NPE cells was achieved by retrovirus infection. the establishment of persistent EBV infection in premalignant nasopharyngeal epithelial cells may represent a crucial step in the pathogenesis of NPC. however, events regulating the infection and propagation of EBV in infected NPE cells are largely unknown. the relationship between cyclin D1 expression and EBV infection in dysplastic nasopharyngeal epithelium is unknown. it is difficult to find dysplastic NPE tissues because most patients present clinically with late stages of the disease. cyclin D1 overexpression and EBV infection are closely correlated in the early stage of NPC development. EBV infection readily induced the arrest of growth in these telomerase-immortalized cell lines. we observed that the inhibitory effects of EBV infection on the growth of NPE cells could be suppressed, resulting in multiple colonies of EBV-infected cells. established stable infection in a premalignant NPE cell that overexpresses cyclin D1 and therefore facilitates the ongoing transformation of the NPE cell."}
