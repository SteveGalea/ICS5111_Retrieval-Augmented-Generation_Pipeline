{"summary": "a novel dual priming oligonucleotide (DPO) system is structurally and functionally different from the primer system currently in widespread use. a poly(I) linker inserted between two stretches of natural bases would form a bubble-like structure and separate a single primer into two functional regions at a certain annealing temperature. the longer 5\u2032-segment preferentially binds to the template DNA and initiates stable annealing. selectively binds to its target site and blocks non-specific annealing. only target-specific extension will result from successive priming of the 5\u2032-segment and the 3\u2032-segment of the DPO. the position of the 3\u2032-segment was determined first, at a site where 6\u201312 bases had a 40\u201380% GC content. five deoxyinosines were designated for the poly(I) linker. the 5\u2032-segment of the DPO was automatically determined by the sequence of the bases upstream of the 3\u2032-segment and extended 18\u201325 bases until the Tm was >65\u00b0C. f-00d Forward CTTCTCTCTCTCGGATTGATGAGIGIIIIIGGATGC 88 Ndufs2/Df-33d Forward CTTCTCTCTCGGATTGATGAGGGGAGATGC 88 Ndufs2/Df-53d Forward CTACTCTCTTGGGATTGAAGAGTTGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG AAAITCGTTTAIIIIITCCATACATG 80 (75) INFB/Lcf Reverse TTACATGTTCGGTAAAAGTCGTTTATTCCTTCCATACATG 83 OC43/Df Forward TATGTTAGGCCGATAATTGAGGACTIIIIIACTCTGACGG 86 (80) OC43/Lcf Forward TATGTTAGGCCGATAATTGAGGACTIIIIIACTCTGACGG 86 (80) OC43 CYP2C19/Lcf Forward GCTTTTATACTATCAAAAGCAGGTATAAGTCTAGGAAATG 81 CYP2C19/Dr-a1e Reverse CAAGGTTTTTAAGTAATTTGTTIIIIITTCCGGG 81 (71) CYP2C19/Lcr-a1e Reverse CAAGGTTTTTAAGTAATTTGTTTTIIIIITTCCGGG 84 aLcf, Lc ea1 and a2 represent allele 1-specific primer and allele 2-specific primer. 3\u2032-RACE of Ndufs2 total RNA extracted from an embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) was reverse-transcribed using the primer dT18-ACP1 (Seegene, Korea) and M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega) syncytial virus B (391 bp), respiratory syncytial virus A (273 bp) and coronavirus OC43 (231 bp) as a negative control, sterile deionized water was used as the template instead of nucleic acid. after preheating at 94\u00b0C for 15 min, 45 amplification cycles were carried out in the thermal cycler. the DPO is composed of three regions, a longer 5\u2032-segment a shorter 3\u2032-segment and a poly(I) linker that bridges these two segments. the position of the 3\u2032-segment was determined first, at a site where 6\u201312 bases had a 40\u201380% GC content. five deoxyinosines were designated for the poly(I) linker because they had generated the best result when 3\u20138 deoxyinosines 88 dT18-ACP1 Reverse CTGTGAATGCTGCGACTACGATIIIIITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT CCAA 87 (75) INFB/Lcf Forward TTGGCTATGACTGAAAGAATAACCAGAGACAGCCCAA 88 INFb/Dr Reverse TTACATGTTCGGTAAAAITCGTTTAIIIIITCCATACATG 80 (75) INFB/Lcf Reverse TTACATGTTCGGTAAAAITCGTTTAIIIIITCCATACATG 80 (75) OC43/Df Forward TATGTTAGGCCGATAATTGAGG the positions of deoxyinosine (I) are highlighted in bold. the positions of mismatched bases in CYP2C19-specific primers are highlighted in bold. d00, 33, 53 represent a perfectly matched primer, a 3 base mismatch in the 3\u2032-end of the primer, a 3 base mismatch in the 5\u2032-end of the primer, respectively. 3\u2032-RACE of Ndufs2 Total RNA extracted from an embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) was reverse-transcribed using the primer dT18-ACP1 (Seegene, Korea) and M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Prom the segment 7 gene of the influenza A virus (513 bp), the segment 1 gene of the influenza B virus (455 bp), the F gene of the respiratory syncytial virus B (391 bp) and the M gene of coronavirus OC43 (231 bp) as a negative control, sterile deionized water was used as the template instead of nucleic acid. after preheating at 94\u00b0C for 15 min, 45 amplification cycles were annealing at 94\u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 63\u00b0C for 30 s and extension at 72\u00b0C for 30 s. RESULTS Effect of DPO on PCR specificity. conventional primers have a single priming region and extension proceeds only when the two priming segments are perfectly matched with the sequence of a template. long conventional primers reduced the non-specific products by increasing the annealing temperature to 65\u00b0C (lanes 1 and 3), while the DPO primer produced only one target product over a wide range of annealing temperatures (lanes 2 and 4). these results clearly support our hypothesis that the unique dual-specificity annealing properties of the DPO primer block non-specific priming events even under less than optimal PCR conditions. primers generated target-specific viral fragments, and no false positives. the presence of respiratory viruses in each patient was further validated by sequencing the fragment. a DPO-based multiplex PCR approach is a reliable tool for detecting multiple pathogens. multiplex PCR analysis of nine human genomic DNA samples with known genotypes at the CYP2C19 locus. we used two different DPO primer sets to detect the three different allelic combinations. the primers are described in Table 1A. the 3\u2032-segment alone, which is 6\u201312 nt in length, has a Tm too low (below 30\u00b0C) to bind its template at the generally used annealing temperatures of 55\u201365\u00b0C. to demonstrate our hypothesis, we conducted 3\u2032-RACE of Ndufs2 with DPO and long conventional primers carrying three mismatched bases in 5\u2032- or 3\u2032-ends. several multiplex PCR-based detection tools have been developed and introduced to direct appropriate therapy. current multiplex PCR-based assays require further validation due to their high rate of false positives (8,9) tide polymorphism (SNP) in CYP2C19 is one of the most thoroughly characterized SNPs. a single base pair substitution (G A) at position 681 in exon 5 of CYP2C19 results in a non-functional protein and affects the metabolism of a number of commonly used drugs. DISCUSSION We have developed a new primer technology, the DPO system. the DPO system differs structurally and functionally from conventional primers. the poly(I) linker prevents formation of secondary structure and effectively eliminates non-specific priming. multiplex PCR is a rapid and economical tool (6). but conventional primers often produce false positives due to primer competition, to primer dimers or to the different melting temperatures of the different primers. current multiplex PCR-based assays require further validation, such as nested PCR or a probe hybridization assay (7,8) it was found that such DNA polymerases have a tendency to completely drop off the DNA when they encounter inosine in a PCR primer (20). the system can be successfully used in multiplex PCR and SNP genotyping PCR."}
