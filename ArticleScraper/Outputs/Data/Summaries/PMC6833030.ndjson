{"summary": "avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a member of the genus Gammacoronaviruses, subfamily Coronavirinae, family Coronaviridae. multiple genotypes and serotypes of IBV isolates identified worldwide. limited cross-protection confers between serotypes of IBVs. s within a certain country or region are unique even though many countries share some common antigenic types. GI-9, GI-27, and GIV-1-genotypes have been implicated in widespread disease disseminations and persistent virus infections in north american. GI-1, GI-11, and GI-16 are currently circulating in south american flocks. southern china is the major production region of yellow chickens. most of the birds are free-range and raised for a longer time. birds are raised in relatively closed environment and lack of ventilation during brooding. IBV field isolates were obtained from the birds of previously vaccinated flocks with H120, LDT3-A and/or 4/91 vaccines. all IBV strains were isolated and propagated as previously described. n/a

Counts of 17, 14, 7, 7, and 6 out of 64 IBV isolates during 2009\u20132017 belonged to LX4-type (QX or GI-19), LDT3-A-type (GI-28), 4/91-type (GI-13), Mass-type (GI-1), and CK/CH/LSC/99I-type (GI phylogenetic trees of gene S1 (a), E (b), M (c) and N (d) of IBVs are marked with filled black triangles. each type of IBV was grouped in one circle and the representative strains were boxed. the bootstrap values were determined from 1000 replicates of the original data. the CK/CH/LSC/99I-type and the LX4-type were the predominant genotypes during 2009\u20132017. the CK/CH/LSC/99I-type isolates were the predominant IBVs according to the phylogenetic study of the S1, E, M, and N genes. the LX4-type isolates had become the predominant IBVs since 2011. 120091 was found to be a recombinant between the new-type 1 isolate and the vaccine strain LDT3-A (minor parent) the potential parents of GX-YL170805 were proved to be a major parent isolate GX-NN1014 (TW2575/98-type) and a minor parent isolate GX-NN10 (4/91-type) recombination events of IBV isolates detected by RDP 4 software. major parent (Similarity) minor parent (Similarity) Detection Method a Beginning Ending GX-NN1011 1040 1482 GX-NN6 (LX4-type) (91.1%) GX-NN-9 (LX4-type) (95.1%) RDP, GENECONV, MaxChi, Chimera, SiScan, 3Seq GX Scan, 3Seq a Only transferred gene fragments where p 1 106 are included in the table. the minor parent is the sequence most closely related to that surrounding the transferred fragment in the recombinant. sequences of S1, E, M, and N genes showed that there were many high entropy amino acid sites within the S1 gene. however, a few positively selected sites were detected although most sites were under neutral selection and purifying selection. all of the positively selected sites within S1, E, M, and N genes had high entropy values of larger than 0.6. the results showed that there were 14\u201322, 1\u20133, 1\u20132, 1\u20133 potential glycosylation sites within the S1, E, M, and N proteins. all the strains presented one N-glycosylation site at E protein residue 11/12 (NGSF) and residue 5/6 (NKTL) all the strains presented one N-glycosylation site at M protein residue 3/4/6 (NCTL) and at N protein residue 32 (NASW) (except CK/CH/LSC/99I-type and Conn-type) 41.96 2 (51/91) 56.04 3 (1/91) 1.10 a except CK/CH/LSC/99I-type strains; b except CK/CH/LSC/99I-type and Conn-type strains; c except CK/CH/LSC/99I-type and Conn-type strains. estimated times for most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of S1, E, M, and N genes were before 1744.97 X, CK/CH/LSC/99I, Peafowl/GD/KQ, Mass, 4/91 were dated back to 1980.55, 1983.91, 1984.33, 1992.82, 2002.92, and 2006.4 respectively. a change in branch color indicates a time change during the genotype\u2019s evolutionary history. a sudden and sharp decline in viral population size was observed between 1970s and 2010s base on the S1 gene. since late 2015, the viral population rapidly rose (Figure 6a) 64 strains of IBV were isolated from diseased chicken flocks in southern China during 2009\u20132017. a total of eight, six, four, and six genotypes were identified based on the S1, E, M, and N genes. the predominant genotype changed from CK/CH/LSC/99I-type during 1985-2008 to LX4-type during 2009\u20132017 based on the S1 gene. the predominant genotype changed from CK/CH/LSC/99I-type during 1985-2008 to LX4-type during 2009\u20132017 based on the S1 gene the circulating homologous field strains were isolated in southern china. none of the LDT3-A genotype strains were isolated after 2012. we found the E genes of most LDT3-A type isolates belonged to the CK/CH/LSC/99I-type, and the M and N genes of most LDT3-A type isolates belonged to the qX-type. recombinants between Taiwan-I-type and LX4 (QX) causing severe economic losses have been reported. wild birds have been of concern as natural IBV carriers. monitoring of wild birds should be needed in further. this first report of a recombination event needs to be further investigated. it is uncertain whether the new-type 1 would become the predominant type in China in further, but it continues circulating in the field suggests that the new-type 1 IBVs are still endemic in China. high rates of recombination result in variability. 4/91-type vaccine strain recombinants may be more likely to escape vaccine immunization than mass-type vaccine strain recombinants. recombinants may be more likely to escape vaccine immunization than recombinants. previous report showed that 4/91 vaccine could persist in birds for 40 days. dN/dS ratios of S1, E, M, and N genes were less than 1. there was a positive correlation between selection pressure and gene variation. it is known that S1 genes had the largest variation, but the mutation of E gene has not been paid enough attention. the change in selection pressures may be due to immune responses induced by multiple types of vaccines, the microenvironment of infected hosts, or physical and biosafety conditions [16]. Molecular evolutionary rate analysis can accurately estimate the molecular dating and it was used to determine successfully the timing of ancestors of classical swine fever virus. a sudden and sharp decrease in genetic diversity base on the S1, E, M, and N genes was observed after 2010 mirroring the implementation with a newly registered LDT3-A-based vaccine. the live vaccine H120 has been used in china for many years and the 4/91-like live vaccine was also commonly used in china since 1990s. DT3-A vaccines could not provide complete protection against the prevalent local strains of IBV in southern China [6]. DT3-A vaccines could not provide complete protection against the prevalent local strains of IBV in southern china. new vaccine urgently needs to go to the market in china. this is the first report showing the changes of genetic diversity, dominant genotypes, and selection pressure of IBV strains. this is the first report showing the changes of genetic diversity, dominant genotypes, and selection pressure of IBV strains."}
