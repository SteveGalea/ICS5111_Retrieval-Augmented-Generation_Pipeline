{"summary": "a cross-sectional study, 3712 students living in 1569 dorm rooms in 13 buildings responded to a questionnaire about incidence and duration of common colds in the previous 12 months. air temperature, relative humidity and CO2 concentration were measured for 24 hours in 238 dorm rooms in 13 buildings during both summer and winter. rhinoviruses have been associated with 40\u201365% of \u201ccommon colds\u201d through the year [4], and up to 80\u201392% of colds during outbreaks [5]. cross-infection from an infected person to a healthy person depends on a number of factors, including how many viral particles are shed by the infected person. three mechanisms have been proposed for transmission of viruses causing airways infections. respiratory diseases at four army training centers were significantly higher among trainees. myatt's study showed that the probability of detecting airborne rhinoviruses was positively associated with weekly average CO2 concentration in an office. other factors found to be associated with rate of infectious diseases include occupancy level [15], cleaning routines and \u201cdamp\u201d buildings. building and room characteristics of 2117 dorm rooms at Tianjin university were surveyed by questionnaires. questionnaire survey was anonymous, but building number and room number were reported by participants. questions on common cold infections were \"how many times have you had a common cold in the previous 12 months\" and \"how long does a common cold usually last\" routine, window opening frequency, occupancy levels, and self-reported common cold incidence and duration were analyzed by Chi-square tests. a carbon dioxide-based risk equation [21] was used to calculate the basic reproductive number of common colds compared to the self-reported infection rate. air quality monitors were calibrated at the international center for indoor environment and energy, Technical University of Denmark prior to measurements. the out-to indoor air flow rate at night was calculated from an analysis of the build-up period of metabolic CO2 produced by sleeping occupants. the average indoor air temperature and relative humidity at night were also measured on campus during the same time. 36% spent 2\u201310 hours per day, and 46% spent more than 10 hours per day. all floors in each dorm building are homogeneous with regard to occupants' gender and education level. 6 bachelor students, 4 master students or 3 PhD students shared one dorm room. number percent, % Common cold incidence Common cold duration Total 3436 6 times 6-10 times > 10 times p3 2 wks 2-4 wks >4 wks p Gender Male 1782 88.3 8.5 3.2 87.7 10.6 1.8 Female 1654 91.7 6.0 2.3 0.006 82.7 15.2 2.1 0.000 Age 23 yrs 2012 89.9 7.8 2.2 84.0 14.2 1.8 24-26 yrs the proportion of occupants with 6 common colds increased significantly (p = 0.002) as did the proportion of occupants with 2 weeks common cold duration (p = 0.000) students in 6-person rooms were about 2.0 times as likely to have a common cold incidence 6 times per year and a duration 2 weeks as students in 3-person dorm rooms. ninety percent of dorm rooms had an out-to indoor air flow rate less than 8.3 L/s per person. average indoor air temperature (mean 28.0\u00b0C, 95% confidence interval (CI) 27.8\u00b0C\u201328.3\u00b0C, range 22.0\u00b0C\u201332.1\u00b0C) and relative humidity (mean 54%, 95% CI 53%\u201355%, range 27%\u201378%) were high. \u00b0C Relative humidity, % Summer Occupancy level 3 people per room 29.6 (1.1) 64 (8) 4 people per room 28.4 (2.0) 55 (8) 6 people per room 27.1 (2.1) 49 (8) Out-to indoor air flow rate Above median (18 L/s per person) 28.6 (1.9) 54 (10) Below median (27.5 (2.2) 53 (10) Winter Occupancy level 3 people per room 20.4 (2.3) 39 (11) 4 people per room 20.8 the ventilation rates in winter are less than those in summer, and may help nail down the critical ventilation rate. there were 7 buildings constructed after 1993, one was not included in the analysis because measurements were performed in only 9 dorm rooms. a mean ventilation rate of 5 L/(s\u2022person) was associated with 6 common colds per year in 5% of occupants. q is the quantum generation rate by an infected person (quanta/h) q is the amount of infectious material needed to produce infection in 63% of uniformly exposed animals. t is the exposure time (h); f = (C-C0)/Ca, where Ca is the volume fraction of CO2 added to exhaled breath, C is the volume fraction of CO2 in indoor air, and C0 is the volume fraction of CO2 in outdoor air. average CO2 concentration from 1:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. in rooms with different occupancy levels. fj is the re-breathed fraction of indoor air in rooms with different occupancy levels, ppm. q is the quantum generation rate by an infected person, quanta/h. t is the time a infector remaining in the dorm room, hour/day. we assume q = 9 quanta/h [25]. t is the time a infector remaining in the dorm room, hour/day. ASHRAE standard of 700 ppm above the background level would not prevent the infection from spreading in a dorm room with 6 occupants unless the quantum generation rate of infectious agents is no more than 1 quantum/h. phase I In Phase I, 3712 students living in 1569 dorm rooms in 13 buildings answered the questionnaire, giving a response rate of 57%. 249 out of 3436 (7.3%) students reported 6\u201310 common colds in the previous 12 months. 94 (2.8%) reported more than 10 common colds. males cleaned rooms more often than males, cleaning rooms twice per week 52% compared to 31% for males. 1.4 0.009 Atopy 1 Yes 231 79.5 15.3 5.2 68.9 26.3 4.8 No 3120 90.7 6.8 2.6 0.000 86.5 11.8 1.7 0.000 ETS 2 Yes 573 87.4 10.0 2.6 86.3 10.9 2.8 No 2799 90.3 6.8 2.8 0.029 85.0 13.2 1.8 0.098 Cleaning routine Every day 509 91.3 6.5 2.2 85.2 13.4 1.4 1-2 times/week 1844 90.8 crowdedness and common cold annual incidence 6 times and duration 2 weeks. dashes represent adjusted odds ratio (AOR) for incidence. dashes represent AOR for duration. data for temperature and relative humidity in rooms with different occupancy levels and out-to indoor air flow rates are shown in Table 2. inverse association between occupancy level and relative humidity was caused by the measurement sequence (6-person dorms were measured at the driest time in May, whereas 3-person dorm rooms were measured in July when outdoor relative humidity was higher. common cold incidence in dorm rooms with average 4 occupants increased from 10% to 12%. when ventilation rate is below 1 L/s per person, common cold incidence increased from 10% to 15%. old buildings had more dampness problems, while new buildings using modern construction technologies had smaller ventilation rates. buildings had 10 dorm rooms measured in winter and were excluded from the analysis. one had mean ventilation rate of 5.7 L/(s\u2022person) and a common cold infection rate of 23.8%. the other had a mean ventilation rate of 6.4 L/(s\u2022person) the average CO2 concentrations in each dorm room from 1:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. were calculated. the estimated and self-reported number of common colds in each day in winter is compared. i = 1, 2, 3. 1-common cold less than 6 times in the previous 12 months; 2-common cold 6-10 times; 3-comon cold more than 10 times. j indicates occupancy level; j indicates occupancy level; j indicates occupancy level. di,j is the proportion of students with different self-reported common cold incidences, %. the quantum generation rate used was 2/h. the critical CO2 concentration above the background levels off if the common cold lasts more than 3 weeks. this indicates that even for less infectious agents with quanta generation rate no more than 2/h, a fresh outdoor air system needs to be used in environments where people spend extended time. there is no evidence that bachelor students have a different memory in reporting common cold infection, compared to PhD students. occupants' education level was not adjusted for when calculating odds ratios of crowdedness for common cold infections. in winter, occupants tended to close doors and windows tightly, so that variations in winter outdoor temperature had little influence on ventilation rate in dorm buildings. the median air change rate was 4.42 h1 and 4.67 h1 when outdoor air temperature is below and above 29.6\u00b0C. the study could have been titled \u201cairways infections\u201d. indoor air flow rate required by the indoor air quality standard of china is 8.3 L/s per person. 90% of the dorm rooms measured during winter had night-time ventilation rates less than this value. crowded spaces have more airways infections than crowded spaces. more studies are warranted. Crowdedness and outdoor air ventilation per person are important for the spread of airborne infectious diseases."}
