{"summary": "IFN-induced antiviral factor tetherin restricts the release of progeny virions from infected cells. the protein has an N-terminal transmembrane domain and a C-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor, which permit tetherin to simultaneously insert into the viral and the plasma membranes. antagonism involves Vpu-dependent removal of tetherin from the site of viral budding. the glycoprotein (GP) of filoviruses is inserted into the viral envelope. it facilitates viral entry into target cells, a process that depends on the interactions of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in GP. more recent work indicated that deletion of the glycan cap of EBOV GP might be incompatible with tetherin antagonism. but the underlying mechanism was not investigated. in summary, it is at present unknown how EBOV GP antagonizes tetherin. HEK293S cells (30), and HeLa cells were maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS); 1% penicillin-streptomycin; and, in the case of GnTI cells, 10 M sodium pyruvate. monoclonal anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen), mouse anti-AU1 antibody (Covance), monoclonal rabbit anti-tetherin antibody (B02P; Abnova); polyclonal anti-actin antibody (Abnova; Sigma); and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-coupled secondary antibodies directed against mouse and rabbit immunoglobulin (Dianova) 293T cells seeded in 6-well-plates were calcium phosphate transfected with plasmids encoding VSV G or EBOV GP or with empty plasmid (pCAGGS) as a negative control. at 18 h posttransfection, the cells were inoculated with VSV*G-Luc (44, 45) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 3 for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. 293T control cells or GnTI cells were seeded in 48-well plates. they were cotransfected with plasmids encoding HIV-1 p55-Gag, tetherin, and a potential tetherin antagonist or with empty plasmid. at 16 h posttransfection, the transfection medium was replaced by fresh culture medium. lysates and lysed supernatants were investigated for the presence of Gag or VP40. the proteins were separated via SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel. membranes were blocked in 5% milk powder in PBS with 0,1% Tween 20. signals were visualized using a commercially available enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit. for quantification of the signal intensity, the program ImageJ was used (46) 293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding EBOV GP wt or EBOV GP with mutations in the RBD and a plasmid encoding tetherin. at 48 h posttransfection, the 293T cells were harvested, washed with PBS, and resuspended in co-IP buffer. after lysis for 20 min at 4\u00b0C, the solutions were cleared from cellular debris by centrifugation at 600 g and aliquoted. diluted 1:100 and 1:500 in 1% FCS, respectively, and the cells were incubated in the primary antibody solution for 1 h at room temperature. staining was analyzed using spinning-disc microscopy and image analysis as described previously. mouse hybridoma cells secreting anti-vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV G) antibody (I1-hybridoma; CRL-2700; ATCC) were cultivated in DMEM supplemented with 20% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. the cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. anti-actin antibody (Abnova; Sigma), horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-coupled secondary antibodies directed against mouse and rabbit immunoglobulin (Dianova) and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-coupled secondary antibodies against mouse immunoglobulin (Dianova) analysis of viral glycoprotein-mediated transduction. 293T cells seeded in 6-well plates were inoculated with plasmids encoding VSV G or EBOV GP or with empty plasmid (pCAGGS) as a negative control. at 18 h posttransfection, the cells were inoculated with VSV*G-Luc (44, 45) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 3 for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. luciferase activities in cell 293T cells or GnTI cells were seeded in 48-well plates and cotransfected with plasmids encoding HIV-1 p55-Gag, tetherin, and a potential tetherin antagonist. at 16 h posttransfection, the transfection medium was replaced by fresh culture medium. for blockade of EBOV GP-dependent tetherin antagonism, GP1-specific monoclonal antibodies were added to the the proteins were separated via SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. the membranes were blocked in 5% milk powder in PBS with 0,1% Tween 20. if murine antibodies against EBOV GP were added to inhibit tetherin antagonism, Gag expression was detected using a human monoclonal anti-Gag antibody at a dilution of 1:5,000 293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding EBOV GP wt or EBOV GP with mutations in the RBD and a plasmid encoding tetherin with an AU1 antigenic tag added to the N terminus. agarose beads were washed two times with co-IP buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 0, at 48 h posttransfection, the 293T cells were harvested, washed with PBS, and resuspended in co-IP buffer. after lysis for 20 min at 4\u00b0C, the solutions were cleared from cellular debris by centrifugation at 600 g. the alignment of a portion of filovirus RBDs was performed using Clustal Omega (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/) the alignment of a portion of the filovirus RBDs was performed using a spinning-disc microscopy and image analysis. analysis of epitope-tagged proteins revealed LLOV GP and EBOV GP were appreciably expressed in transfected 293T cells. EBOV GP-driven entry was more robust than LLOV GP-mediated entry. LLOV GP was expressed and functional and could be examined for tetherin counteraction. 293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding HIV Gag, tetherin, and the indicated viral glycoproteins. transduction mediated by EBOV GP wt was set as 100%. the presence of Gag in supernatants and cell lysates was determined by Western blotting. pseudotypes produced in both cell lines were readily able to transduce target cells. tetherin expression restricted Gag-VLP release from both control and GnTI cells. however, tetherin and GP are expressed in biologically active forms in control and GnTIcells. the results of a single representative experiment carried out with triplicate samples are shown. the error bars indicate standard deviations (SD) similar results were obtained in three separate experiments. subunit, the MLD and the RBD, are required for tetherin antagonism. deletion of the MLD was compatible with robust GP expression (Fig. 3A) and slightly increased GP-driven entry (Fig. 3B) in accordance with published data. expression of all mutants augmented release of VP40 VLPs from tetherin-negative control cells. this suggests that an intact RBD is required for tetherin antagonism by EBOV GP. the release of Gag from cells expressing GP and tetherin was set as 100%. the error bars indicate SEM. ***, P 0.0001. HIV-1 Vpu served as a positive control for tetherin antagonism. the presence of HIV Gag in culture supernatants and cell lysates was determined by Western blotting. proteolytic processing of GP in endosomes exposes the RBD for subsequent binding to NPC1 (17, 18) a recent study reported evidence for the presence of proteolytically processed GP on the surfaces of 293T cells transfected to express GP (51). this suggests that NPC1 might be required not only for EBOV GP-driven host cell entry but also for tetherin antagonism. two compounds, clomifene and terconazole, interfere with tetherin antagonism by GP. biological properties of NPC1 required for GP-driven cell entry are dispensable for tetherin antagonism by cationic amphiphil. mutations in the receptor-binding domain of the Ebola virus glycoprotein do not interfere with tetherin binding. mutations in the RBD that inhibit tetherin antagonism also block tetherin binding. wt EBOV GP mutants with exchanges in the RBD were coprecipitated with comparable efficiencies. 293T cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding tetherin with an N-terminal AU1 tag and EBOV GP wt or the indicated EBOV GP mutants. proteins in cell lysates and precipitates were detected by Western blotting. results of a single representative experiment, confirmed in a separate experiment, are shown. GP1 is a central target for the humoral immune response. we made use of previously described monoclonal antibodies that bind to the MLD in naive GP and protect mice and guinea pigs from a lethal challenge with EBOV. antibody 5E6 had a modest impact on VLP release from tetherin-negative cells expressing GP without MLD. 293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding HIV Gag and EBOV GP or with empty plasmid (Mock) at 16 h posttransfection, the medium was replaced with fresh culture medium supplemented with the indicated antibodies at a final concentration of 20 g/ml or with PBS. mAb, monoclonal antibody served as a loading control. LLOV GP was chosen because expression of filovirus GPs does not modulate release of Gag VLPs from tetherin-negative cells. a VP40-based assay was used only for confirmatory purposes. LLOV GP expression and facilitation of viral entry was determined. LLOV GP is a tetherin antagonist. Plasmids encoding V5-tagged versions of the indicated glycoproteins were transfected into 293T cells. transfection of empty plasmid (Mock) served as a negative control. luciferase activities in cell lysates were measured at 72 h postransduction. processing of N-glycans is stalled at the high-mannose stage (30) processing of N-glycans is required for tetherin counteraction by EBOV GP, but not Vpu. tetherin expression restricted Gag-VLP release from both control and GnTI cells. tetherin expression restricted release from both control and GnTI cells. Glycoprotein expression in cell lysates was detected by Western blotting. three separate experiments yielded similar results. luciferase activities were measured in cell lysates. culture supernatants and cell lysates was determined by Western blotting using an anti-myc antibody. the results of single blots are shown, from which irrelevant lanes were cut out. an intact receptor-binding domain is required for tetherin counteraction. the mutants exhibited strongly reduced tetherin antagonism in the Gag VLP assay, while the W104A mutant was active. expression of all the mutants augmented release of VP40 VLPs from tetherin-negative control cells. this suggests an intact RBD is required for tetherin antagonism by EBOV GP. HIV-1 Vpu served as a positive control for tetherin antagonism. presence of Gag protein in cell lysates was determined by Western blotting. release of Gag from cells expressing GP and tetherin was set as 100%; error bars indicate SEM. transduction mediated by EBOV GP wt was set as 100%. 293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding HIV Gag, tetherin, and the indicated viral glycoproteins. HIV-1 Vpu served as a positive control for tetherin antagonism. 67.7 14.6 L111A 108.6 14.5 45.1 8.4 L122A 120.5 20.5 87.3 12.0 W104A 123.4 15.7 86.7 12.4 a Averages of three experiments; expression was analyzed with antibody 5E6. inhibition of NPC1 does not interfere with tetherin antagonism by the Ebola virus glycoprotein. cationic amphiphiles other than U18666A were also found to raise endosomal cholesterol levels and to block EBOV entry in an NPC1-dependent fashion. both compounds efficiently reduced viral entry, as expected, but did not inhibit tetherin antagonism by GP. 293T cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of compound. the release of Gag from untreated, tetherin-negative control cells was set as 100%; the error bars indicate SEM. mutations in the RBD that inhibit tetherin antagonism also block tetherin binding. we transfected HeLa cells with plasmids encoding EBOV GP wt and mutants. we determined interactions with tetherin via proximity ligation assay. lack of tetherin antagonism by the RBD mutants is not due to lack of tetherin binding. the PLA spot count for cells transfected with EBOV GP wt was set as 100%. the results pointed towards an important role of the GP1 subunit in tetherin counteraction by the Ebola virus glycoprotein. antibody 5E6 can interfere with tetherin antagonism by GP. antibody directed against the GP1 subunit of EBOV GP can block tetherin counteraction. at 16 h posttransfection, the medium was replaced with fresh culture medium supplemented with indicated antibodies at a final concentration of 20 g/ml or with PBS. tetherin is expressed in macrophages (25, 26) and mature dendritic cells (54), which are important filovirus targets (24, 55, 56) tetherin counteraction by GP might be essential for robust viral spread in the host. however, it is unclear how GP antagonizes tetherin and which domains in GP are required. LLOV GP robustly counteracts tetherin, suggesting that tetherin antagonism is conserved among all filoviruses known to date. this finding raises the question of which determinants in filovirus GPs are required for tetherin antagonism. a recent study reported that the glycan cap is essential for tetherin antagonism (29), a finding that was confirmed by the present analysis. however, the possibility that the absence of tetherin antagonism by GP in GnTI cells is due to altered N-glycosylation of tetherin or a cellular factor involved in tetherin antagonism cannot be excluded. mutations in the RBD that abrogate viral entry also inhibit inhibition studies with cationic amphiphiles that induce cholesterol accumulation in endosomes (42), bind NPC1 (U18666A) (53), and block EBOV GP-driven entry in an NPC1-dependent fashion (all compounds) (42) revealed that blockade of NPC1 functions required for viral entry does not interfere with tetherin antagonism. one out of five GP1-directed antibodies may inhibit tetherin antagonism by EBOV GP. one explanation could be that these antibodies simultaneously bind to GP on the particle and on the cell surface, resulting in a tetherin-like restriction of particle release. the antibody could inhibit conformational changes in GP. antibodies generated against EBOV GP1 may interfere with tetherin antagonism. they may inhibit particle release from tetherin-negative cells in a GP-dependent manner. it will be interesting to investigate whether GP1-specific antibodies generated in EVD patients block tetherin antagonism."}
