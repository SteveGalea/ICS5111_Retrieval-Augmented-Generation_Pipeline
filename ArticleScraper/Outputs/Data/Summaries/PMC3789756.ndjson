{"summary": "most cellular cytoplasmic RNAs are single-stranded, and bear a 5\u2032monophosphate (rRNAs and tRNAs) or an N7 methylated guanosine cap (mRNAs) linked via a 5\u2032-to-5\u2032 triphosphate bridge to the first base. a further set of host proteins appears to bind virus-derived RNAs to directly inhibit virus production [8]. dsRNA binding proteins include kinase R and 2\u2032-5\u2032 oligoadenylate synthetase. proteins that bind PPP-RNA, like interferon-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats. some of this antiviral activity has been genetically linked to Ifit1 and -2 in mice [17]\u2013[19]. we identified 528 proteins that interacted with unmodified or RNA-coated beads. 68 proteins were found to be significantly enriched in samples recovered with 5\u2032modified RNA compared to OH-RNA. IFIT5, which shows 57.2% aminoacid sequence identity and 75.6% similarity to IFIT1, was not detected in fractions that bound capped RNA. we found enrichment of Ifit1c, an uncharacterised IFIT protein that is strongly induced by IFN-/ or virus infection. biotinylated RNA with different 5\u2032 end structures (OH, PPP, CAP, CAP0, CAP1) was coupled to streptavidin beads. bound proteins were denatured, alkylated and directly digested with trypsin. IFIT1 is the only IFIT that binds capped RNA. human IFIT1, -2 and -3 associate with each other to form a multiprotein complex. we overexpressed each of the IFIT proteins in 293T cells. human and mouse IFIT1 bind directly to unmethylated capped RNA. luciferase-tagged proteins were incubated with beads only or beads coated with OH-RNA or CAP-RNA. luciferase-tagged murine Ifit proteins affinity purified with CAP-RNA. we performed AP-MS experiments on wild-type (Ifit1+/+) and mutant, Ifit1-deficient (Ifit1/) MEFs. the overall precipitation efficiency was comparable in both cell types, as evidenced by equal enrichment of the RNA-binding protein Syncrip. IFIT1 bound well to unmethylated CAP-RNA and CAP0-RNA (N7 methylated cap) but revealed reduced binding to CAP1-RNA. IFIT1 binds capped RNA in a methylation state-dependent manner. recombinant His-tagged mouse Ifit1 (His-mIfit1), human His-hIFIT1 or human His-EIF4E and bound protein was quantified by western blotting. synthetic RNAs with (CAP1) or without (CAP0) 2\u2032O-methyl group were capped in vitro using recombinant vaccinia virus capping enzyme. human and murine IFIT1 have the capability to directly sense the methylation state of capped RNA. this was in contrast to EIF4E that showed prominent binding when CAP0- or CAP1-RNA was used. we also used wild-type human coronavirus 229E (229E-DA) which generates CAP1-RNA. a wild-type murine coronavirus (mouse hepatitis virus strain A59; MHV-WT); a mutant strain carrying the equivalent amino acid substitution (D130A) in its 2\u2032O methyltransferase [11], [17] (MHV-DA); the latter produced 100-fold less viral RNA and comparably reduced levels of viral protein. cells were then treated with 20 U IFN- and infected with wild-type HCoV-229E (229E-WT; grey bars) or the 2\u2032O methyltransferase-deficient HCoV-229E (D129A) mutant (229E-DA; red bars) total RNA and protein were harvested 24 h post infection. ens of 12 mice per condition were measured 48 h after infection. IFIT1 specifically regulates translation of 2\u2032-O-unmethylated capped viral RNA. presence of a 5\u2032 cap regulates mRNA export from the nucleus. mice were treated with 50 U of IFN- for 2 h prior to infection. cells were treated with 100 g/ml cycloheximide (CHX) or DMSO. total RNA was harvested at 0, 4, and 8 h post infection and analysed by quantitative RT-PCR. individual ratios for MHV nucleoprotein (MHV-N) and membrane protein (MHV-M) in WT- (grey) and DA-infected (red) Ifit1+/+ (circles) and Ifit1/ (triangles) macrophages are plotted separately. data are from three independent experiments. heavy/light ratios of cellular proteins were comparable in Ifit1+/+ and Ifit1/ Ms, irrespective of the virus used for infection. the expression profiles of individual proteins known to be important in innate immune responses against viruses were similar in both cell types infected with either virus. unmethylated CAP-RNA, N7-methylated CAP0-RNA and fully methylated CAP1-RNA were coupled to beads and tested whether the binding ability of recombinant EIF4E is altered by the presence of recombinant IFIT1. competition between Eif4e and Ifit1 for capped RNA was also seen when total lysates of IFN-stimulated MEFs were used as inputs for experiments. bound proteins were analysed by western blotting with antibodies against murine Eif4e and mIfit1. RNA-coated beads were incubated with lysates of interferon-treated Ifit1+/+ and Ifit1/ mouse embryo fibroblasts. we identified 528 proteins that interacted with unmodified or RNA-coated beads. 68 proteins were found to be significantly enriched in samples recovered with 5\u2032modified RNA compared to OH-RNA. a methylation-dependent increase in protein binding was also evident in AP-MS analysis. IFIT5, which shows 57.2% aminoacid sequence identity and 75.6% similarity to IFIT1, was not detected in fractions that bound capped RNA. we compared our AP-MS dataset with transcriptome data of interferon-stimulated cells [21]. biotinylated RNA with different 5\u2032 end structures (OH, PPP, CAP, CAP0, CAP1) was coupled to streptavidin beads. bound proteins were denatured, alkylated and directly digested with trypsin. IFIT1 is the only IFIT that binds capped RNA. human IFIT1, -2 and -3 associate with each other to form a multiprotein complex. we overexpressed each of the IFIT proteins in 293T cells. human and mouse IFIT1 bind directly to unmethylated capped RNA. Isolation of luciferase-tagged human IFIT (hIFIT) proteins from transfected 293T cells. the graphs show luciferase activity after affinity purification. we performed AP-MS experiments on wild-type (Ifit1+/+) and mutant, Ifit1-deficient (Ifit1/) MEFs. the overall precipitation efficiency was comparable in both cell types. IFIT1 bound well to unmethylated CAP-RNA and CAP0-RNA (N7 methylated cap) but revealed reduced binding to CAP1-RNA. IFIT1 binds capped RNA in a methylation state-dependent manner. RNA-coated beads were incubated with recombinant His-tagged mouse Ifit1 (His-mIfit1), human His-hIFIT1 or human His-EIF4E and bound protein was quantified by western blotting. synthetic RNAs with (CAP1) or without (CAP0) 2\u2032O-methyl group were capped in vitro using recombinant vaccinia virus capping enzyme. human and murine IFIT1 have the capability to directly sense the methylation state of capped RNA. we tested the impact of IFIT1 on virus replication. we also used wild-type human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E (229E-WT), which generates CAP1-RNA. coronavirus (mouse hepatitis virus strain A59; MHV-WT) produced 100-fold less viral RNA. MHV-WT grew to high titres in the spleens of infected Ifit1+/+ mice. no viral replication could be detected upon infection with MHV-DA. cells were then treated with 20 U IFN- and infected with wild-type HCoV-229E (229E-WT; grey bars) or the 2\u2032O methyltransferase-deficient HCoV-229E (D129A) mutant (229E-DA; red bars) total RNA and protein were harvested 24 h post infection and analysed by quantitative RT-PCR. IFIT1 specifically regulates translation of 2\u2032O-unmethylated capped viral RNA. presence of a 5\u2032 cap regulates mRNA export from the nucleus. the presence of a 5\u2032 cap regulates mRNA export from the nucleus. 6 mice were treated with 50 U of IFN- for 2 h prior to infection with wild-type MHV (WT) or 2\u2032O methyltransferase-deficient MHV (DA) for 1 h. cells were treated with 100 g/ml cycloheximide (CHX) or DMSO. ratios from LC-MS/MS were plotted as box-whisker plots. individual ratios for the MHV nucleoprotein (MHV-N) and membrane protein (MHV-M) in WT- (grey) and DA-infected (red) Ifit1+/+ (circles) and Ifit1/ (triangles) macrophages are plotted separately. proteins were comparable in Ifit1+/+ and Ifit1/ Ms. neither the presence of Ifit1 nor infection with MHV-DA affected the overall rate of translation in the cells. unmethylated CAP-RNA, N7-methylated CAP0-RNA and fully methylated CAP1-RNA were coupled to beads and tested whether the binding ability of recombinant EIF4E is altered by the presence of recombinant IFIT1. competition between Eif4e and Ifit1 for capped RNA was also seen when total lysates of IFN-stimulated MEFs were used as inputs for experiments. bound proteins were analysed by western blotting with antibodies against murine Eif4e and mIfit1. RNA-coated beads were incubated with lysates of interferon-treated Ifit1+/+ and Ifit1/ mouse embryo fibroblasts. IFIT2 is known to bind to components of the cytoskeleton [24], which could allow intracellular trafficking of the IFIT complex to its sites of action. some IFITs possess conserved biological activities in different species, e.g. human and murine IFIT1 which bind to PPP-RNA and unmethylated CAP-RNA, others appear to have evolved in a species-specific manner. we propose that IFIT1 acts as a molecular switch that allows selective translation based on the 5\u2032 methylation state of the mRNA. the phenomenon of translational control by IFIT1 based on its differential affinity for the capped RNA is reminiscent of the 4E homologous protein (4EHP) in Drosophila and mice, which has been found to control translation by competing with EIF4E for the RNA cap structure. other viruses have evolved specific mechanisms to hide their uncapped/unmethylated 5\u2032 ends. despite these viral strategies to generate host-like mRNAs, IFIT1 remains active against viruses that generate 5\u2032 triphosphate RNA. primary antibodies against ILF-3 (Sigma;
