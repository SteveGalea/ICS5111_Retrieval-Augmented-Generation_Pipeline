{"summary": "the virus family Caliciviridae contains five established genera (Norovirus, Sapovirus, Lagovirus, Vesivirus, and Nebovirus) most of these agents are enteric pathogens whose replication and chief clinical manifestations are gastroenteritis. examples of these viruses include human norovirus (HuNoV), porcine norovirus, bovine norovirus, human sapovirus, porcine sapovirus, and the recently discovered Tulane virus. despite major efforts, there are still no FDA-approved vaccines or antiviral drugs available for HuNoV. from 1999 to 2007 HuNoV caused, on average, 797 deaths per year in the united states. chicken IgYs are transferred from blood to the egg yolk during embryo development. production of antibodies via laying hens only requires the collection of eggs. the technology is a safe, convenient, and inexpensive strategy to prevent and control infectious diseases, especially for gastrointestinal infections. rVSV-VP1 was highly expressed in chicken cells infected by rVSV-VP1. hens vaccinated rVSV-VP1 induced a high level of HuNoV-specific IgY in egg yolks. intramuscular vaccination produced approximately three times more HuNoV-specific IgY than combination of intramuscular and nasal drop vaccination route. infected cells were infected with rVSV-VP1 at a multiplicity of infection. cell culture fluid was harvested and virus titer was determined by plaque assay in vero cells. the blot was probed with guinea pig anti-human noV VP1 antiserum. dilution was 1:6000 followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-guinea pig IgG secondary antibody. chickens were housed in isolation rooms provided with HEPA-filtered intake and exhaust air. blood samples were collected from each chicken to confirm they were negative for HuNoV antibody. chickens in group I were immunized intramuscularly by injecting 500 L of DMEM containing 5 107 PFU of rVSV-VP1 into three different locations of the pectoral muscle. VLPs were purified from cell culture supernatants and cell lysates by ultracentrifugation through a 40% (w/v) sucrose cushion. purified VLPs were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) followed by Coomassie blue staining. the precipitated pellets were dissolved in 10 mL of PBS and then precipitated again with 12% of PEG 8000. the final pellets were dissolved in 2.0 mL of PBS and filtered through a 0.45 m filter. the purity of the IgY was determined by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie blue staining. the bound HRP was colorized by substrate reagent (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Inc., Gaithersburg, Maryland, USA), followed by a reading of the signal intensity at 450 nm. the standard curve of absorbance was used to quantify the relative concentration of total IgY and HuNoV-specific IgY from the egg yolks. the membrane was incubated with anti-HuNoV-specific IgY or nonspecific IgY (1:1000) in 1% nonfat milk-PBS at 4 \u00b0C overnight, followed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti- chicken IgY secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a dilution of 1:5000. HBGA blocking assay was performed to determine the inhibitory activity of IgY against the binding of HuNoV VLPs to the HBGA antigens. boiled human saliva samples with known HBGA phenotypes (A, B, or O) were diluted 1000-fold and coated on 96-well microtiter plates at 4 \u00b0C overnight. plates were washed 3 times with 0.1 mol/L sodium phosphate buffer (pH, 6.4) the purified total IgY solution (1 mL, 1:100, pH 7.4) was diluted in 0.1 mol/L sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.4) the pH of the solution was adjusted using either HCl or NaOH to a final pH ranging from 2 to 11. the pH of the solution was adjusted using either HCl or NaOH to a final pH ranging from 2 to 11. BSRT7 cells in T150 flask were infected with rVSV-VP1 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10. after 1 h of absorption, the inoculum was removed, and the cells were washed twice with DMEM. cell culture fluid was harvested, and virus titer was determined by plaque assay in vero cells. cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 5% -mercaptoethanol, 0.01% NP-40, and 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) at indicated time points, cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 5% -mercaptoethanol, 0.01% NP-40, and 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) the blot was probed with guinea pig anti-human no chickens in group I were immunized intramuscularly by injecting 500 L of DMEM containing 5 107 PFU of rVSV-VP1 into three different locations of the pectoral muscle. chickens in groups I and II were boosted with 5 107 PFU of rVSV-VP1 via intramuscular and combination of intramuscular and intramuscular. eggs were collected daily until week 4 post-booster vaccination. hens were observed daily for any abnormal reactions. egg yolks were diluted in three volumes of PBS. the mixtures were centrifuged at 13,000 g for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C. the precipitated pellets were dissolved in 10 mL of PBS. the final pellets were then precipitated again with 12% of PEG 8000. 100 L of goat anti-chicken IgY-HRP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. the bound HRP was colorized by substrate reagent (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Inc.) Western blot analysis examined reactions of the chicken IgY with HuNoV capsid protein. the purified virus-like particles (VLPs) were separated by conventional 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham) after blocking with 5% nonfat milk, the membrane was incubated with anti-HuNoV-specific IgY or nonspecific IgY (1:1000) color was then developed by adding tetramethylbenzidine peroxidase liquid substrate. stopped after 10 min of incubation at 22 \u00b0C by adding 1 mol/L sulfuric acid. the IgYs from chickens before immunization were used as controls. the results were calculated by comparing the optical densities (ODs) measured with and without blocking by the chicken IgYs. rVSV-VP1 replicated efficiently in a wide range of mammalian cell lines. previously, BSRT7 and DF-1 cells were infected with rVSV-VP1. rVSV-VP1 replicated efficiently in both DF-1 and BSRT7 cells. BSRT-7 and DF-1 cells were infected with rVSV-VP1 at an MOI of 10. samples of supernatant were harvested at indicated time points. cytoplasmic extracts were harvested at indicated time points. rVSV-VP1 was highly expressed in both BSRT7 and DF-1 cells during 4-30 h postinfection. VP1 expression in DF-1 decreased after 30 h postinfection due to cell death. total IgY was purified from each egg collected at weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4 postvaccination. to examine the purity of total IgY, 5 L of total IgY was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. two protein bands with molecular weight of 68 and 27 kDa were observed. purified HuNoV VLPs (approximately 56 kDa) were separated by SDS-PAGE. as a positive control, a band of 56kDa protein was detected when anti-HuNoV VP1 serum antibody raised in guinea pig was used. rVSV-VP1 vaccination triggered HuNoV-specific IgY in egg yolks. at weeks 2, 3, and 4 postvaccination, the levels of HuNoV-specific IgY in intramuscular group were significantly higher than those in the combined intramuscular and nasal drop vaccination group (p 0.05). at week 4 postvaccination, HuNoV-specific IgY in intramuscular group reached 4.8 mg/yolk whereas only 1.8 mg/yolk HuNoV-specific IgY was detected in intramuscular and nasal drop group. the percentage of HuNoV-specific IgY increased from 0.7% to 5% in the intramuscular immunization group. intramuscular injection alone was more effective in triggering HuNoV-specific IgY than combination of intramuscular and nasal drop route. the results showed that both immunization routes were capable of producing HuNoV-specific IgY. control IgY from pre-immunized hens was negative in this assay. total IgY from intramuscular vaccination group had significantly higher OD values. it appears that VLPs had a stronger binding activity to type A saliva compared to types B and O saliva. 96-well plates were coated with a known saliva type (A, B, or O) at 4 \u00b0C overnight. guinea pig anti-HuNoV VLP antiserum was added, followed by the addition of HRP-conjugated goat anti-guinea pig IgG. IgY blocked binding of HuNoV VLPs to type O antigen. data are average of three replicates the standard deviation. 3.7. thermal stability of IgY. HuNoV VP1 Is Highly Expressed in Chicken Cells VSV replicates efficiently in a wide range of mammalian cell lines. rVSV-VP1 replicated efficiently in both DF-1 and BSRT7 cells. BSRT7 and DF-1 cells were infected with rVSV-VP1 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10. after 1-h incubation, the cells were removed, the cells were washed with DMEM, and fresh medium was added. samples of supernatant were harvested at indicated time points. BSRT7 and DF-1 cells were infected with rVSV-VP1 at an MOI of 10. the expression of VP1 was detected at 4 h postinfection in both cell lines. VP1 expression in DF-1 decreased after 30 h postinfection due to cell death. total IgY was purified from each egg collected at weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4 postvaccination. to determine whether rVSV-VP1 triggers HuNoV-specific IgY, total IgY was purified. Western blot analysis of HuNoV VLPs using HuNoV-specific IgY. two-hundred nanograms of VLPs was loaded in SDS-PAGE. to next determined whether purified total IgYs contain HuNoV-specific IgY. the amount of HuNoV-specific IgY gradually increased after rVSV-VP1 immunization. at weeks 2, 3, and 4 postvaccination, the levels of HuNoV-specific IgY in intramuscular group were significantly higher than those in the combined intramuscular and nasal drop vaccination group. the amount of total IgY in each egg yolk ranged from 84.4 3.8 to 86.4 7.8 mg. the percentage of HuNoV-specific IgY gradually increased from 0.7% to 5% in the intramuscular immunization group. intramuscular injection alone was more effective in triggering HuNoV-specific IgY than combination of intramuscular and nasal drop route. purified total IgY from rVSV-VP1 vaccinated groups strongly reacted with HuNoV VLPs in the saliva-based HBGA binding assays. total IgY from intramuscular vaccination group had significantly higher OD values than those in combined vaccination group. a HBGA blocking assay has been developed [28,29]. it measures the ability of antibody blocks the binding of HuNoV VLPs to the attachment factors. this assay can serve as a surrogate assay for serum\u2013virus neutralization assay. chicken IgY induced by rVSV-VP1 vaccination blocks binding of HuNoV VLPs to type A antigen. IgY blocked binding of HuNoV VLPs to type A antigen. the blocking activity of the chicken IgY remained stable at pH 4\u20139 for 3 h. however, a significant decrease of blocking activity was observed when the pH is lower than 4 or higher than 9. rVSV-VP1 replicated to a high titer in many mammalian cell lines, insect cell, yeast, worm, and C. elegans. the virus yields in DF-1 cells were comparable to those produced in BSRT7 cell. rVSV-VP1 produced similar amounts of VP1 protein in both DF-1 and BSRT7 cells. rVSV-VP1 is a promising vaccine antigen for large-scale production of IgY in chickens. rVSV-VP1 is a potential passive immunization and therapeutic agent for HuNoV. it is a leading cause of viral gastroenteritis worldwide. studies showed that HuNoV-specific IgYs could cause lethal infection in humans. this is particularly in high-risk populations, such as infants, young children, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals. this is a promising passive immunization approach to prevent and treat HuNoV infection and illness. a mouse model found that IgY could prevent murine rotavirus infection [37], bovine rotavirus-induced diarrhea [38], and human rotavirus-induced gastroenteritis [39]. a human rotavirus-specific IgY administered orally as a milk supplement passively protects neonatal pigs against an enteric human rotavirus infection [40]. a chicken usually lays 280 eggs/year and each egg yolk normally contains 150\u2013200 mg of IgY, which has 2 to 10% antigen-specific antibodies. it is safe for pasteurization (below 72 \u00b0C) of IgY for human consumption. the receptor blocking activity of IgY decreased when temperature reached above 75 \u00b0C. this study will facilitate the large-scale production and purification of HuNoV-specific IgY for virus detection, diagnosis, passive immunization and therapy."}
