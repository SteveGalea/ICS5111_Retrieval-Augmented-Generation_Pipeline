{"summary": "the newly selected journals compared the number of original articles and reviews registered in the selected journals to those in the 'Infectious Disease Category' the journals published 14,156 original articles and reviews of Asian origin and 118,158 throughout the world. quantitative survey to understand study trends on prevention, detection, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases is an advantage for formulating further research strategies. there are relatively few comprehensive analyses of all infectious disease research; only several previous studies on the EU [22-24] and specific world regions, including Japan [25-27] studies on overall research trends across Asia have not been reported, regardless of specific approaches such as HIV/AIDS research in India [30], tuberculosis research in india and china [31] and japan's share of articles published in 7 journals. this bias may disadvantage researchers in Asia, whose study results are published in not only international journals but also their regional journals. able disease, sexually transmitted disease, and zoonosis in B, antibacterial, antiviral, antimicrobial, vaccine, and antibiotic in D were translated into French, German, Italian, Spanish, Turkish, Chinese (in Roman letters) and Japanese (in Roman letters) in order to select journals written in non-English languages. survey with English and non-English keywords introduced an approach based on both partial matching (for a search of journal titles that contain the keywords) and complete matching (for a search of titles that perfectly matches the keywords) we finally selected journals in which original or review articles were included in the PubMed database provided by the U.S. National Library of Medicine. we compared the number of research articles registered in the selected journals to those in the SCI Infectious Disease Category during the period. we surveyed articles registered in the SCI category in a manner similar to those in the above selected journals. we screened non-English journals using Japanese, Chinese, French, German, Italian, Spanish, and Turkish keywords corresponding to the keywords in A-E. in parallel, we screened non-English journals using Japanese, Chinese, French, German, Italian, Spanish, and Turkish keywords. 89 of 91 journals were registered in English or both English and Korean (in Roman letters) in the ScopusTM database. we targeted original articles and reviews as research articles. the latter was considered an indicator of research activity and the latter as an appreciation of research results. compared the number of research articles registered in the newly selected journals to those in the SCI Infectious Disease Category during the period. 264 candidates were selected to screen infectious disease journals. 240 were selected by English key words and 24 by non-English words. 264 journals were published in 30 countries and written in 12 languages. the Japanese Journal

Asian origin and 118,158 of the world total. the journals in the SCI category published 4,621 of Asian origin and 66,518 of the world total during 1998-2006. the total of Asian research articles accounted for 12% of the world total in the survey of 100 journals. each year during the study period, the proportion of original articles of Asian origin relative to the world total was about 8.6-14.2% in the 100 journals and 4.7-9.3% in the SCI category. reviews of Asian origin was about 4.2-6.9% in the 100 journals. 4.7 15.7 2.1 0.3 1.9 India 95.8 4.2 16.3 13.5 16.1 2.1 0.7 1.9 Taiwan

the ratio of the number of original articles to the population of individual Asian countries showed a median value of 0.2 publications/1 million population/year (range, 0.1-6.9) during 1998-2006. the ratio of the number of reviews showed a median value of 0.1 publications/1 million population/year (range, 0-0.5) 264 candidates were selected to screen infectious disease journals. 240 were selected

published 14,156 research articles (original articles and reviews) of Asian origin and 118,158 of the world total. the journals in the SCI category published 4,621 of Asian origin and 66,518 of the world total. a survey of the 100 journals showed a consistently higher percentage than the SCI Infectious Disease category during 1998-2006. the total of Asian research articles accounted for 12% of the world total in the survey of 100 journals. the number of research articles from 1998-2006 was more than about 18-fold (China), 3.9-fold (Taiwan) and 3.5-fold (India) the number of original articles produced in Japan was stable (the number in 2006 was about 1.2-fold that in 1998). the ratio of the number of original articles to the population of individual Asian countries showed a median value of 0.2 publications/1 million population/year (range, 0.1-6.9) during 1998-2006. the ratio of the number of reviews showed a median value of 0.1 publications/1 million population/year (range, 0-0.5) production of reviews according to the GDP, Vietnam (3.3), Singapore (2.5) and Taiwan (2.4) were most productive. there was a statistical correlation between the average GDP and the number of original articles or reviews in Asian countries. our method has several methodological limitations. first, the keyword setting for journal selection has limitations. the 100 newly selected journals are not equivalent to existing full infectious disease journals. this is attributed to the fact that we set representative keywords for journal selection in several languages used by many people throughout the world. research articles originating from each Asian country should be counted under fixed condition for an international comparison of research productivity. research articles originating from each country should be counted under fixed condition for an international comparison of research productivity. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors'
