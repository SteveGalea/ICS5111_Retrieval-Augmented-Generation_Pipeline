{"summary": "MERS-CoV is a novel coronavirus that causes pneumonia in humans. more than 1,500 confirmed cases have been reported, with a relatively high case fatality rate. there is still a lack of understanding of how this virus is transmitted between humans and from camels to humans. viral shedding in dromedary camels and humans can be detected in nasal swabs of dromedaries infected with MERS-CoV but not in MERS patients (12, 13). we hypothesize that a critical determinant of MERS-CoV replication in the respiratory tracts of different hosts is the differential expression of the viral receptor. endogenous peroxidase was blocked by incubating the slides with 3% hydrogen peroxidase for 15 min in a 600-W microwave. dPP4 was detected with 5 g/ml anti-human goat IgG antibody. negative controls were stained with normal goat serum in equal concentrations. PP4 was detected in the ciliated epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract epithelium of dromedary camels. in the alveoli, it was detected mostly in the endothelial cells and barely in the alveolar epithelial cells. the absence of DPP4 in the upper respiratory tract epithelium of humans may keep MERS-CoV from replicating efficiently here. new tab Presence of DPP4 mRNA and protein in the human nasal epithelium and submucosal glandular epithelial cells. DPP4 mRNA (arrows) and protein were detected in the submucosal gland cells by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. ubiquitin C and dapB mRNAs were used as positive and negative controls. mFc-S1 MERS-CoV, mFc-S1 OC43, mFc-S1 PEDV, anti-DPP4 MAb, or isotype mouse antibody did not bind to either nasal or kidney tissue samples. mFc-S1 PEDV and mouse isotype antibodies did not bind to either nasal or kidney tissue samples. mFc-S1 OC43 binds to the nasal epithelium (indicated by arrows) as a negative control, mFc-S1 PEDV and mouse IgG2a and IgG2b isotype antibodies were used. positive staining is red. influenza viruses that bind exclusively to 2,3-sialic acid are less likely to be transmitted (24). we observed expression of the MERS-CoV receptor in glands located in the submucosa of the upper respiratory tract epithelium. the susceptibility of these cells and their capacity to support MERS-CoV replication need to be investigated in future studies.
