{"summary": "in 1978, researchers demonstrated that an H1N1 influenza virus strain from 1950 and another strain from 1977 were unusually closely related. the 1977 cluster has the closest degree of genetic similarity to strains isolated in 1948 and 1950, strains isolated in Rome, Italy, in 1949, and strains isolated in Fort Leonard Wood, MO, in 1951. 1/1949(H1N1) CY147358 1949 A/Roma/JY2/1949(H1N1) CY077719 1950 A/Netherlands/001G1/1950(H1N1) CY009332 1950 A/Fort Warren/1/1950(H1N1) CY021701 1950 A/Albany/4836/1950(H1N1) CY147334 1950 A/Fort Warren/50-JY2/1950(H Strains were downloaded from the NCBI Influenza Virus Resource database via the accession number. distance was calculated using BLOSUM 62 based on HA amino acid sequence. black box indicates 1977 strains and the most similar late 1950s strains. influenza was considered to be an incapacitating agent, especially to those without previous exposure to a specific virus strain. the royal air force in Upper Heyford, England, was first affected in January 1978, followed by the U.S. Air Force Academy (USAFA) in february. there were documented attempts to find the 1918 pandemic H1N1 strain in old icehouses where victims were buried. studies were performed attempting to create radiation-resistant and aerosolized influenza virus (11) a 1976 H1N1 swine flu outbreak was feared to have pandemic potential. in 1976, the swine H1N1 epizootic influenza virus infected 230 soldiers at Fort Dix, NJ, causing severe respiratory illness in 13 and one death (12). a biosafety lapse in a research laboratory is now most often cited as the cause of the 1977-1978 reemergence of the H1N1 influenza virus strain. the world health organization excluded the lab accident possibility. it is likely that the swine flu scare prompted the international community to reexamine their stocks of the latest previously circulating H1N1 strains to try to develop a vaccine. however, the tripartite origin of the outbreak in northeast china that produced almost identical isolates is not supportive of the conclusion that this was a single laboratory accident. in 1991, in the last days of the Soviet Union, researchers suggested that the virus was \u201cpotentially frozen\u201d in nature until its reemergence. in 2008, it was suggested that the epidemic was \u201cprobably\u201d the result of an influenza vaccine trial (19, 20), as there were soon-discredited rumors that it was the result of a lab accident (21, 22) controversy over the potential risks of GOF research led to the decision by the u.s. government to pause federal funding for GOF influenza research and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) research. the moratorium for MERS and other coronavirus research was lifted, but the evaluation of GOF influenza research risks and benefits is expected to take nearly a year."}
