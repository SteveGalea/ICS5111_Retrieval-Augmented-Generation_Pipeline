{"summary": "in the field, pigs of all ages are susceptible to PEDV infection. most severe outcome often occurs in suckling piglets under 1 week of age (4, 5) PEDV is present in many pork-producing countries, including Korea, China, Japan, Vietnam, and the Philippines (8\u201313) a peptide derived from the heptad repeat 2 region of S2 has been reported to be able to suppress PEDV entry and induce neutralizing antibodies. the highly virulent PEDV variants are genetically divergent from the classical strains. deletions, insertions, and amino acid substitutions within S have been found in field strains compared to strain CV777 (18, 20, 41\u201343). classical vaccines (e.g., DR13, SM98, and CV777) do not provide efficient cross-protection against challenge by novel PEDV variants. a lack of efficient cross-neutralization has been reported (10, 44\u201346) a lack of efficient cross-neutralization has been reported. the rescued viruses BJ2011C and CHM2013 replicate with kinetics similar to those of their respective parental viruses in cell culture. the rescued viruses caused severe diarrhea of piglets with extensive damage to the intestinal epithelium. chimeric infectious cDNA clones with exchanged structural protein (SP)-coding regions. the boxes represent the genomic fragments of parental backbone viruses CHM2013 (blue) and BJ2011C (green) the recombinant viruses, named BJ2011C-SCHM, CHM2013-SBJ, BJ2011C-SPCHM, CHM2013-SPBJ, and CHM2013-SP + 3UTRCHM, were verified by sequencing the swapped regions. the virus infections were confirmed by immunofluorescence staining of the infected Vero cells with monoclonal antibodies to the nucleocapsid protein. the resulting mutant, BJ2011C-SCHM, acquired the growth properties of CHM2013, a deviation from its parental virus, BJ2011C. piglets were randomly divided into 9 groups with 5 pigs in each group, except for the mock-infected control group, which contained 3 piglets. the piglets challenged with CHM2013 showed normal weight gain (Fig. 3A and C) these results were in accordance with our recent report on the pathogenic properties of the two viruses (53). the mutant behaved just like CHM2013 in terms of the average weight gain caused (Fig. 3A), clinical scores (Fig. 3B), fecal scores (Fig. 3C), and gross and histopathological lesions (Fig. 4 and 5). thetas indicate significant differences between chimeric viruses CHM2013-SPBJ and CHM2013. the error bars indicate standard deviations. piglets were examined on the day of death or euthanasia at the final time points. replacement of the SP region with the 3\u2032 UTR enabled CHM2013 to gain the pathogenic property. this was evidenced by an average weight loss (Fig. 3A), increased clinical scores (Fig. 3B) and severe diarrhea (Fig. 3C) in the pigs infected with the mutant CHM2013-SPBJ. however, the infection was not lethal, and all the piglets survived. replacement with either S, SP, or SP plus 3\u2032 UTR of CHM2013 enables BJ2011C to lose its pathogenic property. the SP region contributes to both viral colonization and postcolonization pathogenicity. pigs challenged with the virus started to shed the virus on day 1. the results from the gain of function of the CHM2013-SBJ, CHM2013-SPBJ, and CHM2013-SP + 3UTRBJ groups showed that the mutant with replacement of the S gene alone did not shed virus. replacement with either SP or SP plus the 3\u2032 UTR enabled CHM2013 to gain the shedding property. we could detect BJ2011C, CHM2013-SPBJ, and CHM2013-SP + 3UTRBJ in all the intestinal segments from infected piglets. however, no virus genomes were detected in any intestinal segments in the groups challenged with BJ2011C-SPCHM, BJ2011C-SP + 3UTRCHM, CHM2013, CHM2013-SBJ, or DMEM (mock control) pBJ2011C-SPCHM, pCHM2013-SPBJ, pBJ2011C-SP + 3UTRCHM, and CHM2013-SP + 3UTRBJ. the chimeric viruses were successfully rescued by transfecting the corresponding BAC plasmids into Vero cells. the recombinant viruses were subsequently named BJ2011C-SCHM, CHM2013-SBJ, BJ2011C-SPCHM, the growth properties in vero cells of the rescued viruses were measured by multistep growth assay with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01. the result showed that CHM2013 had faster growth kinetics than BJ2011C and reached a plateau around 24 h postinfection (hpi) piglets challenged with CHM2013 showed normal weight gain. the mutant behaved just like CHM2013 in terms of the average weight gain caused (Fig. 3A), clinical scores (Fig. 3B), fecal scores (Fig. 3C), gross and histopathological lesions. the intestinal lesions were examined on the day of death or euthanasia at the final time points. the intestinal lesions were examined on the day of death or euthanasia at the final time points. piglets were infected with the mutant CHM2013-SPBJ. a further gain of virulence for CHM2013 enabled the pigs to gain the pathogenic property. this was evidenced by an average weight loss, increased clinical scores and severe diarrhea. SPBJ groups exhibited typical PEDV-like lesions. their stomachs contained little milk curd, and the small and large intestines were distended by watery contents. replacement of SP and the 3\u2032 UTR enabled the low-virulence CHM2013 to gain the pathogenic property, an indication of gain of function. no detectable virus shedding could be found in the mock- or CHM2013-challenged group. replacement of the S gene, SP, or SP plus 3\u2032 UTR had profound effect on virus shedding. replacement with either SP or SP plus 3\u2032 UTR enabled CHM2013 to gain shedding property. thetas indicate significant differences between chimeric viruses CHM2013-SP + 3UTRBJ and CHM2013 (###, P 0.001). the error bars indicate standard deviations. the error bars indicate standard deviations. phenotype of the CHM2013-SP + 3UTRBJ mutant suggests the 3\u2032 UTR plays a synergistic role in these processes. the pathogenicity of the novel PEDV variant is a multigenic property. the pathogenicity of the novel PEDV variant is a multigenic property. cDNA clone of highly virulent PEDV PC22A strain caused only mild to moderate diarrhea with no mortality. deletion of the N-terminal 197 aa may cripple the function of the S protein. however, deletion of the N-terminal 197 aa may cripple the function of the S protein. infected piglets do not require much virus for infection leading to disease. this highlights the remarkable ability of highly virulent PEDV strains to breach the physical, chemical, and immunity barriers. this highlights the remarkable ability of the highly virulent PEDV strains to breach the physical, chemical, and immunity barriers. the avirulent phenotype of the BJ2011C-SCHM and BJ2011C-SPCHM mutants suggests that the 3\u2032 UTR of BJ2011C is unlikely to play a decisive role in virulence but rather synergizes with structural proteins in viral pathogenesis. however, the sequences in the 5\u2032 two-thirds of the genome, including the 5\u2032 UTR, ORF1a, and ORF1b, also contribute to the vir chimeric mutants were isolated from either cell culture (strain TC-PC177; cell adapted) (57) or swine farms (strain TTR-2) (58) both strains are avirulent to piglets. an engineered mutant (icPC22A-S1197) bearing a 197-aa deletion in the N terminus of S caused only mild to moderate diarrhea with no mortality. a synergistic mechanism for PEDV pathogenesis was found. this was concluded from the gain-of-function studies in which CHM2013 acquired virulence. this is in stark contrast to the parental virus, CHM2013, for which we could not detect any sign of infection of the small intestine. avirulent strain, i.e., S indel variants (60), was added to the background of the in vivo colonization-competent CHM2013-SPBJ mutant. the resulting mutant, CHM2013-SP + 3\u2032UTRBJ, resulted in a higher clinical score, but also caused the death of piglets. avirulent phenotype of the BJ2011C-SCHM and BJ2011C-SPCHM mutant full-length infectious cDNA clone plasmids pBAC-BJ2011C and pBAC-CHM2013 were used for constructing chimeric full-length clones of PEDV. a set of unique restriction enzymes, PacI, ApaI, and BstBI, were used. the first was to exchange the CHM2013 S1-coding region upstream ApaI sites. the fragments were designed to have a 20-bp overlap relative to each other and to the plasmid backbone, pBAC-BJ2011C, and then cloned into a PacI/ApaI doubly digested backbone. in the subsequent step, the rest of the CHM2013 S gene coding region (downstream ApaI site, 21028 to 24769) and structural coding region (ORF3/E/M/N; 24795 the unique restriction enzymes used included ArvII, ApaI, BstBI, and XhoI. all the intermediate and final plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing.
