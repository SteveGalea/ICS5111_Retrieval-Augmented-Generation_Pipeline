{"summary": "enterovirus 71 (EV71) is a group of viruses that belongs to the Picornaviridae family. it includes coxsackieviruses, polioviruses, echoviruses and rhinoviruses. EV71 has a size of approximately 30 nm, and is a non-enveloped, positive, single-stranded RNA virus. a one-million-case increase in the number of HFMD cases has been observed in china alone between 2011 and 2014. there is no commercial antiviral drug or vaccine against EV71 available to the masses. this lack of an anti-viral drug and vaccine against EV71 is largely due to two facts. inactivated Vaccines Vaccines have always been considered as one of the most effective preventions against various types of infections, ranging from bacterial to viral infections. the development of vaccines is seen as one of the top-most priorities in the fight against EV71. a GMT titer of 106 was reported in Kunming\u2019s inactivated vaccine trial. compared to the 325.3 and 165.8 for Vigoo and Sinovac respectively. these inactivated vaccines are effective against EV71 infections. their effectiveness may be limited when deployed worldwide. the anti-EV71 sera, derived from the vaccination with a particular strain of EV71, are unable to provide cross-protection against all subgenogroups. a plausible reason for this phenomenon could be the sequence variations that lie outside of these highly conserved regions. the degree of exposure of these neutralizing epitopes is different among the subgenogroups, causing the difference in the amount of universal neutralizing antibodies produced. inactivated vaccines induce systemic immune response, which leads to production of IgM and IgG, with little IgA. inactivated vaccines are a group of insect-specific pathogens, with each species targeting a very limited host range. the baculovirus expression system (BVES) has been widely exploited in modern-day research for protein expression. the ability of expressing proteins in their native form can be observed in the expression of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) protein using BVES. BVES relies on eukaryotic insect cells for protein expression. this is especially important when expressing larger proteins with tertiary configurations. there are several advantages of baculovirus-expressed vaccines over inactivated vaccines. the complete elimination of any fear that may arise from incomplete inactivation of highly pathogenic viruses during the manufacturing process of inactivated vaccines. baculovirus does not cause harm to human beings and its handling only requires biosafety class 1 practices. formalin-inactivated EV71 had lower neutralizing titers than binary ethyleneimine (BEI)-inactivated ones. baculovirus vaccines would not face this issue since no inactivation would be required. BVES permits the formation of virus-like particles (VLPs). a study found that the purified EV71 baculovirus-expressed VLPs are capable of inducing a neutralizing titer of 212.3. this is statistically similar to the titer of 212 when inactivated EV71 vaccines are used. baculovirus-expressed VLPs have rather low yields, a major issue that impedes their utilization for mass production. baculovirus surface display vaccines are based on the expression of the desired antigenic proteins on the surface of the baculovirus envelope. as GP64 proteins would be incorporated into the membrane of the baculovirus, the desired antigenic proteins would be displayed on the surface of the matured baculovirus. a research group has previously expressed the EV71 VP1 proteins on the baculovirus. the Bac-Pie1-GP64-VP1 baculovirus elicited greater neutralizing titers than Bac-Ppolh-GP64-VP1. supportively, the neutralizing titer was just two times lower than that when heat-inactivated EV71 was used. this, hence, shows the feasibility of using surface display vaccines. the titer is believed to be a result of the presence of the large GP64-VP1 extracellular domain that is likely to interfere with the budding of baculovirus from the host cells. the team showed an increase in sera-neutralizing titers by four to eight times [48]. this implies that the larger GP64-VP1 extracellular domain is not the entire cause for this lower titer. RIYMRMKHVR epitope is highly conserved among 11 EV71 subgenotypes. RIYMRMKHVR epitope is highly conserved among 11 EV71 subgenotypes. EV71/subgenotype C2 VP2 Linear Amino acids 136\u2013150. BB1A5 [58] EV71 strain 52-3/subgenotype C4 VP2 Linear 136-155 (Thr (T141A), Glu (E142A), Ser (S144A) and His (H145A) being the most critical points) Able to neutralize B3, B4, C2, C4 and C5 subgenogroups. 2G8 [60] EV71 strain AH/08/0 /subgenotype C4 VP1 17 of the GH loop are disordered in the procapsid but form a structured loop in the infectious virus. able to bind to procasid, which protects the live virus from neutralizing antibodies. when being binded to 22A12, the protective shield is lost. the VP1 of EV71 is responsible for the binding of the virus to the epithelial cells of the intestine [21]. this would probably induce the mucosal immune system. unlike VLPs and inactivated vaccines, no adjuvant may be required for baculovirus surface display vaccines when used as vector vaccines. activation of CD4+ T-cells would lead to expression and secretion of IgM antibodies that target the particular pathogen-of-interest. with a more intensive MHC: antigen presentation, a greater immune response could be induced, hence reducing the need for adjuvants. baculovirus surface display vaccines could induce a good level of immunity even without the use of adjuvants. these particles lack the viral genomic material as well as most, if not all, of the viral non-structural proteins. they are believed to be a better substitute for the inactivated virus vaccines. baculovirus-expressed VLPs have similar efficacy in eliciting immune responses as the inactivated vaccines. baculovirus-expressed VLPs have relatively low yields, a major issue that impedes their utilization for mass production in real life. a research group has recently employed the use of suspension Hi Five cells, instead of SF9 cells, in hopes of increasing the overall yield. a big gap for baculovirus-expressed VLPs to be termed economically viable for mass production. group has previously expressed the EV71 VP1 proteins on the baculovirus. they evaluated the use of such recombinant baculovirus as a vaccine. the difference lies in the promoter used for the regulation of the respective GP64-VP1 expression cassettes. Bac-Pie1-GP64-VP1 vector replaced with a 27aa H3N2 haemagglutinin TM domain. the current EV71-VLPs induce a higher amount of neutralizing antibodies than Bac-Pie1-GP64-VP1 surface display. this lower immunogenicity could be attributed to the lower recombinant baculovirus titer. iter remains to be lower than that when beI-inactivated EV71 virus is used for vaccination. the lower immunogenicity of Pie1-GP64-VP1 surface display could be caused by the fact that only VP1s are displayed on the recombinant baculovirus. 4C6 [24] EV71 Hn2 strain/subgenotype C4 VP1 Linear SSKSEYSLVI (aa 240\u2013250); RIYMRMKHVR (aa 250\u2013260) Neutralization only tested on Hn2 Strain. 2G8 [60] EV71 strain AH/08/0 /subgenotype C4 VP1 Linear YPTFGEHKQEKDLEYC Shown capable of neutralizing C4 subgenogroups. ala substitutions at Y208, T210, G212, K215, K218, L220, E221, and Y222 could completely abolish or significantly reduce the binding reactivity. mab 24 [63] EV71 Tainan/4643/98/C2 VP1 Conformational Not known With neutralization capabilities but no data on the subgenogroups tested. a suggested improvement that could be made to the current baculovirus surface display would be to co-express and co-display of all three VPs on the one recombinant baculovirus. baculoviruses are unable to replicate within mammalian host cells. transduced mammalian cells, especially those antigen-presenting cells, express foreign proteins. this presentation of the MHC: antigen complexes would then lead to the activation of CD4+ T-cells. intravenous immunoglobulin treatment Vaccinations are only suitable for individuals with immune systems capable of raising an immune response against the foreign targets/particles. intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) treatment thus becomes a great option in providing protection for these groups of people. IVIg in confirmed EV71-infected individuals led to changes in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine levels, suggesting its therapeutic effect. the anti-inflammatory cytokine levels are responsible for the rapid relief of EV71 symptoms, suggesting its therapeutic effect. the mechanism for the therapeutic effect provided by IVIg is still to be fully elucidated. the use of IVIg in EV71 prevention or treatment may lead to more harm than good because the products contain many such non-neutralizing IgG3 antibodies. the use of neutralizing antibodies is considered a form of passive immunity. antibodies have been generated and reported by various research groups around the world. they include (i) Mab51 and (ii) 10D3, with both of them as IgM isotypes. a key attribute to their universal neutralizing capabilities is their ability to recognize highly conserved epitopes present in all EV71 subgenotypes. a newly isolated universal monoclonal antibody from our lab has been shown to protect EV71-infected mice both prophylactically and therapeutically. this, thus, proves the possibility of generating and isolating such highly valuable monoclonal antibodies. the difference between IVIg and monoclonal antibody treatments lies in the content of the products. in recent years, several technologies have been developed in hopes of resolving this issue. chimerizing and humanizing antibodies, using transgenic mice for human monoclonal antibody production, and immortalizing human memory B-cells derived from patients\u2019 blood [92,93,94,95] the latter technologies are still not widely adopted in today\u2019s context as they have their limitations. the majority of the immunogenic portions lie in the Fc region, chimeric antibodies have a much lesser immunogenicity compared to the fully murine ones. however, the chances of immune rejection after being inoculated into humans remain a concern. the humanization of murine antibodies is made available prior to passive immunization. baculovirus-expressed VLPs seem to be a better alternative to inactivated vaccines. this is largely owed to the advantages they have over inactivated vaccines. baculovirus surface display vaccines serve as the more attractive option."}
