{"summary": "nosocomial TB in India accounts for one fifth of the world's incident TB cases. every year, TB develops in nearly 2 million persons in India. an estimated 40% of the Indian population is latently infected with M. tuberculosis. rural medical school 726 HCWs, including medical and nursing students (median age 22 y, 62% female) underwent both TST and IGRA 50% positive by TST or IGRA NA NA NA Prevalence of LTBI was probably underestimated because of nonresponse among senior physicians Pai et al., sevagram, 2006 (27) Rural medical school 216 medical and nursing students (median age 21 y) were tested with TST and IGRA; both tests were urban medical school 101 HCWs who had TB disease were compared with 101 randomly selected controls from the same hospital NA NA NA body mass index 19 kg/m2. TB developed in 9 (2%) of 470, for an incidence of 11.2 new cases per 1,000 person-years. 125 healthcare workers were treated for active TB between 1992 and 2001. the annual incidence of pulmonary TB was 0.35\u20131.80 per 1,000 persons during this period. the annual incidence of extrapulmonary TB was 0.34\u20131.57 per 1,000. the incidences of TB disease and infection are higher than the national averages. the estimated incidence of TB among residents was 10-fold higher than the incidence for the country (28). pleural TB is different from other forms of extrapulmonary TB and is associated with the highest fingerprint clustering rate of all forms of TB. factors that increase risk for nosocomial exposure Overwhelming numbers of TB patients and repeated exposure to smear-positive TB patients Unnecessary or prolonged hospitalization of smear-positive TB patients Delays in initiating anti-TB treatment for those with TB Poor adherence to treatment, use of suboptimal treatment regimens, and lack of adequate patient support to improve adherence. lack of effective infection-control procedures Failure to recognize and isolate patients with active pulmonary TB a survey of TB hospitals in india showed nearly 1 million patients sought treatment in 1999. a third of hospitals admitted every sputum smear\u2013positive TB patient encountered at their institution. poor adherence to treatment, lack of continuous drug supply, lack of adequate treatment support, and insufficient treatment duration have been reported. only 22% of 204 private practitioners in Delhi reported ordering sputum smears for a patient with suspected TB. only 12% of 204 private practitioners in Delhi reported ordering sputum smears for a patient with suspected TB. healthcare workers may believe that they cannot avoid nosocomial infection. personnel respiratory protection measures (e.g., N95 respirators) are probably not feasible because of the high cost. the use of respirators may be relatively costly to implement and of limited effectiveness in high-incidence, resource-limited settings. new data suggest that IGRAs hold promise for serial testing of healthcare workers and can overcome some limitations of serial tuberculin testing. a recent study from india showed that in a setting with intensive nosocomial exposure, healthcare workers had strong interferon- responses that persistently stayed elevated even after treatment for latent infection (42). persistence of infection or reexposure might account for this phenomenon. a large proportion of Indians pay for health care with personal funds rather than health insurance. these guidelines need to be adapted to the Indian context by RNTCP. implementing adequate infection control measures is the responsibility of each healthcare facility. is extrapulmonary disease more common than pulmonary TB among HCWs? is IGRAs more accurate, feasible, and cost-effective than TSTs for serial testing of HCWs? TB, tuberculosis, latent TB infection, IGRA, interferon release assay, tuberculin skin test. India, with its vast human and intellectual capital, nearly countrywide DOTS coverage, and a large, well-funded, successful national TB control program, is well placed to tackle this problem."}
