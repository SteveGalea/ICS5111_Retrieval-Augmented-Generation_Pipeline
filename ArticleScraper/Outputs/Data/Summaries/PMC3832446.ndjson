{"summary": "innate immune responses are activated through host pattern recognition receptors. PRRs initiate signaling pathways, ultimately triggering the production of type I interferons (IFNs) the type I IFN signal is then transducted by the activation of Janus kinase (JAK) family protein kinases. IPS-1 complex recruits downstream adaptor proteins tumornecrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), TRAF3 and TRAF6, and TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and I kappaB kinse (IKK). ubiquitination is a highly regulated process that has been found to be involved in a myriad of cellular functions. deubiquitinating enzyme A (DUBA) selectively cleaves polyubiquitin chains on TRAF3. CYLD removes lysine-63-linked polyubiquitin chains from receptor interacting protein (RIP) despite the importance of DUBs, the functions of DUBs during the antiviral innate immune response are largely unknown. pNF-B-Luc and pISRE-Luc were from Stratagene. full-length hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged mutants in which all but one Lys residue (HA-K48-Ub or HA-K63-Ub) was replaced with Arg were gifts from T.

HEK-293T cells were transfected with DNA constructs encoding IFN--Luc. overexpression of RIG-I, IPS-1, TRAF2 or TRAF6 significantly activated IFN- promoter compared with cells transfected with an empty vector control. however, such effects were all substantially reduced in presence of USP25. the input tagged proteins were verified with the indicated antibodies. we investigated whether the IFN antagonist function of USP25 is associated with the deubiquitination of RIG-I, IPS-1, TRAF2 and TRAF6, which are essential signaling components in the type I IFN pathway activated by virus infection. inating enzymes encoded in the human genome have received extensive attention. in this study, we identified USP25 as a major deubiquitinase of RIG-I, TRAF2 and TRAF6 in type I IFN induction. it is thought not all USPs that contain well-conserved motifs have DUB activity. USP11 negatively regulates TNF-induced NF-B activation associated with IB and attenuates IB degradation. USP20 deubiquitinates TRAF6 and suppresses interleukin 1 (IL-1)- and tax-induced NF-B activation. ubiquitin ligase TRIM25 is necessary and sufficient to activate IPS-1. cIAP1/2 triggers downstream signaling cascade to produce type I IFN. however, certain cellular USPs are known to modulate the antiviral innate immune response. co-immunoprecipitation investigation showed that USP25 interacted with RIG-I and TRAF6 to reduce type I interferon induction. further investigation will be required to identify mutants that disrupt the interaction of USP25 and RIG-I/TRAF6 but do not affect DUB activity. kines and type I IFNs negatively modulates type I IFN signaling. usP25 acts as a DUB that cleaved ubiquitin chains from RIG-I, TRAF2 and TRAF6. this inhibits type I IFN signaling."}
