{"summary": "the demand elasticity of each surgery type was then estimated by autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) analysis. results During the study period, the surgical volumes of most selected surgery types either increased or remained steady. urology departments may be in a position to have part of their staff reallocated. mple studies have been reported concerning effective disease control in hospitals in such circumstances [4\u20137]. it is therefore mandatory for healthcare institutions to reallocate manpower from less in demand services to critical ones. in economics, demand elasticity refers to changes in demand quantity in response to a specific factor, such as price, income, or risk. the demand elasticity indices for each surgical category can be applied to properly reallocate staffing during contagious disease outbreaks. the national health insurance program in Taiwan was launched in 1995. it covered 93% of population in Taiwan in 1997 and kept increasing thereafter to 99% by the end of 2010. 47.0, 47.01 and 47.02 represent appendectomies, laparoscopic appendectomies and other appendectomies. the last two codes provide detailed information about the specific surgical technique employed. for each surgery type, we first used the monthly surgical volume from 1998 to 2001 as time series data. ICD9-CM procedure code Monthly volume Demand elasticity Codes Description (mean SD) 79.3X Open reduction of fracture with internal fixation 257.132.2 26.4 49.4X Procedures on hemorrhoids 85.818.0 108.2 47.0X Appendectomy 85.511.4 10.0 51.2X Cholecystectomy 56.512.8 112.3 68.4X Total abdominal hysterectomy 48.513.6 76.2 86.6X Free skin graft the total volume for hysterectomies showed a growing trend over the study period. a low demand elasticity implies that the fear for SARS did not make any significant change in the elasticity. the high demand elasticity group consisted of transurethral prostatectomy (ICD9 code 60.2X) and extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ICD9 code 98.5X) the observed monthly volumes dropped much lowers than the expected values. the remaining surgery types all fell into the moderate demand elasticity group. the most common indication for transurethral prostatectomy is benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) the most common indication for transurethral prostatectomy is benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) patients with BPH may have trouble with urination; for example, an urgency to urinate. Murphy et. al. have proposed a competency-based approach to health human resources planning. we suggest that surgery demand elasticity can serve as another dimension to optimize the practice of manpower reallocation during an infectious outbreak."}
