{"summary": "commensals, symbiotic, and pathogenic microorganisms colonize our body. microbiota are indispensable for the host, as they contribute to the functioning of essential physiological processes including immunity and metabolism. host-microbiota survival strategies are likely to be limited. the host interacts with microbiota through proteins, metabolites, small molecules and nucleic acids. the microbiota employs a range of effectors to modulate host cellular functions and immune responses. most proteins of bacterial and eukaryotic pathogens are not accessible to bind to host proteins. different microbial compositions and effector protein combinations from these microbial species may have additive (cross-activation) or subtractive (cross-inhibition) impacts on the host pathways, which lead to signal amplification or inhibition, respectively. molecular mimicry is a common strategy that microorganisms exploit to bind to host proteins and perturb its physiological signaling. molecular mimicry can take place at four levels: mimicking (i) both sequence and 3D structure of a protein. interface mimicry is frequently observed within intra- [33\u201335] and inter-species [18, 36]. exogenous (inter-species) interfaces mimic each other [33\u201335] and exogenous (inter-species) interfaces mimic each other. pathogenic protein A has two interfaces: blue interface it binds to B and grey interface it binds to C and D. pathogenic protein P competes to bind to the blue interface on A. the TRIF-dependent downstream path of TLRs recruits TRAF3. it leads to activation of interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) and production of key antiviral cytokines, interferons. microbial proteases prevent both TLR-induced MAPK and NF-B signaling. bacterial acetyltransferases (VopA of Vibrio parahaemolyticus [47], YopJ/YopP of Yersinia [48], AvrA of Shigella Typhimurium [49], kinases (OspG of Shigella [50], NleH1 and NleH2 of E tavirus [57, 58] inhibit this protein to limit IFN production [59] tavirus [57, 58] inhibit this protein to limit IFN production [59] tavirus [57, 58] inhibit this protein to limit IFN production. other immune pathways also need to be considered. random node attacks do not harm the network as much as removing hubs from scale-free networks. a hub by microbiota is likely to influence the cell, either resulting in lethality, or in beneficial modulation. integrated superorganism interactions networks may suggest candidate host and microbial node targets. structure of the CypA-Vpr complex shows that pro-35 is at the interface. if the structure of the CypA complex was unknown, it would have been difficult to understand why, or how, this mutation disrupts the PPI. Previously built structural HMI networks demonstrated that endogenous interfaces that are hijacked by pathogens are involved in multiple transient interactions [18, 36]. these endogenous interfaces exhibit \u2018date-like\u2019 features, i.e. they are involved in interactions with several endogenous proteins at different times [18, 36]. Previously built structural HMI networks demonstrated that endogenous interfaces that are hijacked by pathogens are involved in multiple transient interactions. thousands of species residing in the host, thousands of HMIs are yet to be identified. computational approaches are becoming increasingly important in prioritizing putative HMIs. both available endogenous and exogenous interface structures can be used as templates to detect novel HMIs. both experimental and computational approaches have false-positives and false-negatives with varying rates depending on the approach. attempts to complete host-microbiota interactome will improve our knowledge of microbiota and their roles in health and disease. unraveling the HMIs for commensals and pathogens can elucidate how they repurpose the host signaling pathways. studies often focus on individual protein interactions and try to explain the pathogenicity of a microorganism with a single interaction. transkingdom (metaorganism) network analysis is a robust research framework. it is reasonable to concomitantly consider all host pathways and HMIs. mRNA, protein-protein interaction and metabolic networks have already been taken. Molecular mimicry Microbiota developed several strategies to interact with host proteins and modulate its pathways. one efficient way is molecular mimicry, which has been extensively reviewed in our recent study. host counterparts rewire host signaling pathways for their own advantage. for example, the Helicobacter pylori secreted protein CagA interacts with human tumor suppressor TP53BP2, inhibits apoptosis and allows survival of infected host cells. map protein of E. coli and SopE protein of Salmonella bacteria bind and activate human Cdc42, a Rho GTPase, and trigger actin reorganization in the host innate immune system is the TLR family. its members detect diverse bacterial compounds, like peptidoglycan, lipopolysaccharide, and nucleic acids of bacteria and viruses. they induce pro-inflammatory or anti-viral responses. bacterial TIR-containing proteins compete with endogenous TIR-containing proteins. they interfere with the assembly of the TIR-domain signalosome and prevent downstream signaling. bacterial proteases prevent both TLR-induced MAPK and NF-B signaling. microbial proteins targeting the TLR pathway are examples. a simplified representation of the TLR pathway where the orange nodes are the host proteins and red nodes are the microbial proteins. this is a simplified representation of TLR pathway where the orange nodes are the host proteins. a protein node can serve concomitantly as a party and date hub. large assemblies typically fall into this category. a protein node can serve concomitantly as a party and date hub. structural interaction networks provide a higher resolution with mechanistic insights. they can decipher and resolve those that are not obvious in binary interaction networks. structures can detail which endogenous host PPIs are disrupted by the HMIs, possible consequences of mutations on either host proteins or pathogenic proteins. superimposed view of 4mi8:AC and 2p1l:AB. where Gamma Herpesvirus vBcl2 (red) and human Bcl-XL (green) bind to distinct interfaces on human beclin-1 (grey) this superimposed view shows the superimposed view of 1f5q:AB and 1buh:AB. this shows the superimposed view of 1f5q:AB and 1buh:AB. despite progress in experimental techniques, it is still challenging to determine structures of structural HMI networks. despite the progress in experimental techniques, it is still difficult to determine structures of PPI complexes, particularly HMIs. protein of Helicobacter pylori, the most dominant species in gastric microbiota, has a unique sequence that does not resemble any human protein. with sequence-based methods, it is impossible to find HMIs for VacA. utilizing interface similarity, rather than global structural similarity, would generate a more enriched set of HMI data together with atomic details. identification of the HMIs will also help drug discovery and superorganism networks would suggest how inhibition of an HMI can influence the whole system. crosstalk among microorganisms is also emerging as critical. ta and their interactions with the host are still in its infancy. many unknowns and questions will be uncovered soon."}
