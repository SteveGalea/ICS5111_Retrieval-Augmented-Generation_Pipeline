{"summary": "the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS/VISA/Cardif/IPS-1) has been recently uncovered to seed a critical protein complex on the mitochondrial outer membrane [1]\u2013[4] this signalosome consists of TNFR-associated factors (TRAF2/3/6) [5], TNFR-associated death domain protein (TRADD) [6], translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 70 (TOM70) [7], ubiquitously expressed transcript (UXT-V MAVS inhibits apoptosis from apoptosis from apoptosis from apoptosis. it is important to explore the role of mitochondria in virus-induced apoptosis. the molecular mechanism of how MAVS regulates apoptosis remains poorly understood. c-Jun N-terminal kinase 2 (JNK2) triggers cell apoptosis in either Mavs / cells or Mkk7 / cells. Jnk2 / mice, but not Jnk1 / mice, displayed marked inflammatory injury in both lung and liver after viral challenge. a novel signaling pathway, MAVS-MKK7-JNK2, to mediate virus-induced apoptosis. knockdown of MAVS did not affect tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF)-triggered phosphorylation of JNK, ERK or p38. HEK293 cells were transfected with the Flag-MAVS plasmid or empty pCDNA3.0 vector (EV) for 24 hours. k1/ or MAVS knockout (Mavs/) MEF cells were immunoblotted for phosphorylated JNK. we tested if the relevant signaling proteins could also activate JNK. the results suggest that MAVS is the converging point for activating JNK. control, JNK1 deficiency or JNK2 deficiency are dispensable for virus-induced interferon (IFN-) signaling. HEK293 cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids and 24 hours later, cell lysates were collected for western blot analysis using anti-PARP antibody to determine cell apoptosis. cells were treated with or without kinase inhibitor SP600125 (5 M) cell lysates were collected for western blot analysis to measure cell apoptosis using the indicated antibodies. there was no difference in the cleavage of PARP or caspase-3, between RIG-I knockout and wild type control. we hypothesized that the MAVS-dependent activation of JNK was linked to virus-induced apoptosis. MKK7 functionally links MAVS to JNK2 during virus-induced apoptosis. both MKK4 and MKK7 could phosphorylate JNK1/2 in response to TNF-, growth factors, DNA damage et.al. we individually knocked down MKK4 and MKK7 in HEK293 cells. cell lysates were collected for western blot analysis using anti-JNK, anti-p-JNK, anti-MKK3, anti-MKK4, anti-MKK6, anti-MKK7 and anti-actin antibodies. HEK293 cells were transfected with NC, MKK4 and MKK7 siRNAs respectively for 48 hours. the endogenous interaction between MAVS and MKK7 was markedly enhanced upon SeV infection. MKK7 was also unable to bind to MAVS-TM, which is deprived of the trans-membrane domain(TM) cation mutants were transfected into HEK293T cells along with Flag-MAVS. cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody, followed by western blot analysis. total cell lysates as well as mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions were probed with anti-HA, anti-caspase-3 and anti-Tom20 antibodies. only MKK7-DVD, neither MKK7-3D nor MKK7-PK could bind MAVS. a sub-pool of MKK7 constitutively co-localized with mitochondria. in mavs/ cells, MKK7 lost the ability to localize to mitochondria. apoptosis was measured by western blot analysis of PARP and cleaved caspase-3. HA-tagged JNK1, JNK2 and mutated JNK2 were re-introduced into Jnk2 / MEF cells. flag-tagged wild type MAVS and truncation mutant MAVS-TM were re-introduced into mavs / MEF cells. ectopic-expression of wild type MKK7 could rescue the SeV-induced apoptosis in Mkk7/ cells. however, MKK7-3D could not (Figure 5C) the mortality of the Jnk2 / mice was proportional to the amount of VSV administrated. only a small fraction of the Jnk1 / mice died and no wild type mice died. wild type C57BL/6, Jnk1 / or Jnk2 / mice were infected with NDV-GFP (106 PFU/g mouse weight) two days after viral challenge, lungs were collected for fluorescence stereomicroscopy to observe NDV-GFP in situ. eighteen hours later, the NDV-GFP infected cells were observed. BMDMs from wild type, Jnk1 / or Jnk2 / mice were treated with or without SeV (MOI = 1) for 48 hours, followed by Annexin-V staining analysis. BMDMs from wild type, Jnk1 / or Jnk2/ mice were treated with or without SeV (MOI = 1) for 48 hours. the indicated siRNAs were transfected into HEK293 cells together with NF-B-Luc reporter or PRDIII-1-Luc reporter plasmids. 24 hours later, cells were infected with or without SeV. in vivo function of JNK2 in apoptosis, lung and liver of Jnk1 / and Jnk2 / mice were prepared for immunohistochemistry following SeV, VSV or NDV challenge. the tissues of these organs from Jnk2 / mice displayed severe inflammatory injury. knockdown of MAVS appeared to attenuate JNK activation. this did not affect the activation of ERK or p38 (Figure 1B). HEK293 cells were transfected with the Flag-MAVS plasmid or empty pCDNA3.0 vector (EV) for 24 hours. 1 knockout (Tbk1/) or MAVS knockout (Mavs/) MEF cells were immunoblotted for phosphorylated JNK and deficient protein. Considering the critical function of MAVS in innate immunity, we tested if relevant signaling proteins could also activate JNK. control, JNK1 deficiency or JNK2 deficiency are dispensable for virus-induced interferon (IFN-) signaling. control, JNK1, but not JNK1, is essential for virus-induced apoptosis. cell lysates were collected for western blot analysis using anti-PARP antibody. HEK293 cells were treated with or without kinase inhibitor SP600125 (5 M) cell lysates were collected for western blot analysis to measure cell apoptosis using the indicated antibodies. we also measured seV-induced apoptosis in Rig-i/ MEFs. no difference in cleavage between RIG-I knockout and wild type control. we hypothesized that the MAVS-dependent activation of JNK was linked to virus-induced apoptosis. MKK7 functionally links MAVS to JNK2 during virus-induced apoptosis. MKK4 (MAPK kinase 4) and MKK7 are potential upstream kinases for JNK1 and JNK2. both MKK4 and MKK7 could phosphorylate JNK1/2. cell lysates were collected for western blot analysis using anti-JNK, anti-p-JNK, anti-MKK3, anti-MKK4, anti-MKK6, anti-MKK7 and anti-actin antibodies. HEK293 cells were transfected with NC, MKK4 and MKK7 siRNAs for 48 hours and then treated by SeV (MOI = 1) for the indicated times. NK1, JNK2 or MKK4 failed to do so (Figure 4A) we also confirmed the endogenous interaction between MAVS and MKK7. notably, this endogenous interaction was markedly enhanced upon SeV infection. HEK293 cells were transfected with HA-MKK4 or HA-MKK7 plasmids for 24 hours. cells were then stimulated with or without SeV (MOI = 1) for 6 hours. total cell lysates were probed with anti-HA, anti-caspase-3 and anti-Tom20 antibodies. only MKK7-DVD, neither MKK7-DVD nor MKK7-PK could bind MAVS. a sub-pool of MKK7 constitutively co-localized with mitochondria, whereas no co-localization was evident with MKK4. MAVS-MKK7-JNK2 represents a novel apoptotic signaling cascade. Mkk4/7 / MEFs with HA-MKK4 ectopic-expression were used to mimic Mkk4 /. cells were transfected with the indicated combinations of plasmids for 24 hours. wild type MAVS and truncation mutant MAVS-TM were re-introduced into mavs / MEF cells, followed by similar analysis as described in C. ectopic-expression of wild type MKK7 could rescue the SeV-induced apoptosis in Mkk7/ cells. however, MKK7-3D could not bind MAVS. the mortality of the Jnk2 / mice was proportional to the amount of VSV administrated. only a small fraction of the Jnk1 / mice died and no wild type mice died. 293 cells culture media and incubated for 24 hours. lungs were collected for fluorescence stereomicroscopy to observe NDV-GFP in situ. eighteen hours later, the NDV-GFP infected cells were observed by fluorescence microscopy. BMDMs from wild type, Jnk1 / or Jnk2 / mice were treated with or without SeV (MOI = 1) for 48 hours, followed by Annexin-V staining analysis. BMDMs from wild type, Jnk1 / or Jnk2/ mice were treated with or without SeV (MOI = 1) for 18 hours. the indicated siRNAs were transfected into HEK293 cells together with NF-B-Luc reporter or PRDIII-1-Luc reporter plasmids. 24 hours later, cells were infected with or without SeV (MOI = 1). the lung and liver of Jnk1 / and Jnk2 / mice were prepared for immunohistochemistry following SeV, VSV or NDV challenge. the tissues of these organs from Jnk2 / mice displayed severe inflammatory injury, particularly around the blood vessels in the liver. MAVS is a critical converging point of the host response to RNA virus infection. by engaging RIG-I or MDA5, MAVS forms a mitochondrial signalosome, dynamically composed of TRAF2/3/6, TRADD, TOM70, UXT-V1 and so on. the role of JNK1 and JNK2 in virus-induced apoptosis is largely redundant in canonical apoptosis signaling. it remains to be addressed why MAVS selectively interacts with MKK7 instead of MKK4. KK4 has been shown to have more affinity for JSAP1/JIP3 than JNK1 or JNK2 [25]. the authors demonstrated that MAVS was associated with SARM1-mediated cell death in neurons. however, no specific molecular mechanism was presented in their study. STING activates both IKK and IRF3, turning on the NF-B and IRF3 signaling pathways. future studies will address whether STING plays a role in apoptosis. it remains intriguing to examine potential sensor(s) for RNA virus-induced apoptosis. hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed at the core facility for cell biology. mice were sacrificed and the lungs perfused with PBS. in situ NDV-GFP was observed using a fluorescence stereomicroscopy. anti-actin (A5316, Sigma), normal mouse IgG (sc-2025, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-HA (sc-7392, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Flag (F1804, Sigma), anti-Tom20 (11802-1-AP, Proteintech; sc-571, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-p-p38 (sc-7149, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-p-p38 (sc-7149, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti- anti-p-IRF3 (4947, Cell Signaling), anti-TRAF3 (sc-876, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-TRADD (sc-46653, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-RIG-I (AB54008), anti-MDA5 (5321, Cell Signaling), anti-MKK3 (5674, Cell Signaling) and anti-MKK6 (9264, Cell Signaling). cDNAs were cloned from a human th the siRNA oligos were synthesized by GenePharma: JNK1 siRNA: 5\u2032GCCCAGUAAUAUAUAGUAGUATT3\u2032, 5\u2032GAGCUAUGAAAUTT3\u2032. the siRNA oligos were synthesized by GenePharma: JNK1 siRNA: 5\u2032GCCCAGUAAUAUAUAUAUAGUAGUATT3\u2032. plasmids were introduced into cells using Lipofectamine 2000. then cells were incubated for 48 hours before further analysis. real-time PCR Total cellular RNA was isolated using oligo(dT) primers. western blot and immunoprecipitation Cell pellets were collected and resuspended in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP40, 0.25% Na-deoxycholate, 1 mM Na3VO4, 0.1 mM PMSF, Roche complete protease inhibitor set) the resuspended cell pellet was vortexed for 20 the supernatant was centrifuged at 500 g for 10 minutes to precipitate crude mitochondria. the supernatants were collected as the cytosolic fraction. the precipitate was lysed by RIPA buffer to obtain the mitochondrial fraction. the data are represented by three independent experiments. the scale of animal experiments has been instructed in figure legends. a p value 0.05 was considered statistically significant. mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions at the Shanghai SLAC Laboratory Animal Company. all animals used in this study were 48 weeks of age. animal experiments were carried out in strict accordance with the regulations in the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals. in situ NDV-GFP was observed using Olympus SZX16 fluorescence stereomicroscopy. sera was added into culture media of HEK293 cells. titer was determined by a standard plaque assay. anti--actin (A5316, Sigma), normal mouse IgG (sc-2025, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-HA (sc-7392, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Flag (F1804, Sigma), anti-Tom20 (11802-1-AP, Proteintech; sc-17764, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-MAVS (generated by this laboratory and also purchased from Cell Signaling\u20133993), anti-JNK (sc-571, Santa Cruz Biotechnology anti-MKK3 (5674, Cell Signaling) and anti-MKK6 (9264, Cell Signaling). mitotracker red was obtained from Molecular Probes and DAPI was obtained from Life Technologies. cells were transfected with siRNA oligos using Lipofectamine 2000. they were then incubated for 48 hours before further analysis. plasmids were introduced into cells using Lipofectamine 2000.
