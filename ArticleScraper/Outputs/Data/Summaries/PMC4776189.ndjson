{"summary": "HTLV-1 is the first identified pathogenic retrovirus that is etiologically associated with two major diseases: adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) and a progressive myelopathy called HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) four types of HTLVs, named HTLV-1, HTLV-2, HTLV-3, and HTLV-4, have been characterized. tax expression is frequently silenced during the long clinically latent period of the virus [5,11]. the immunogenicity of HBZ protein is low compared with that of Tax protein [15,16,17]. HBZ gene is essential for cellular transformation and leukemogenesis of HTLV-1. the third mechanism involves the nonsense mutation, deletion, and insertion of the tax gene in ATL cells. the third mechanism includes DNA hypermethylation and histone modification of the 5' LTR of HTLV-1, which silences viral gene transcription. HBZ gene knockdown inhibits proliferation of HTLV-1-infected cells. the level of the usHBZ protein was much lower than that of sHBZ [28] Western blot analyses could detect only the sHBZ protein in ATL cell lines. promoters for both the sHBZ and usHBZ genes are TATA-less [26] sHBZ and unHBZ proteins differ in only seven amino acids at their N-terminal AD domains. expression level of sHBZ is four times higher than that of usHBZ in ATL cells. HTLV-1 is conserved and unmethylated in all ATL cases. HBZ gene knockdown inhibited proliferation of HTLV-1-infected cells. HBZ may play a critical role in HTLV-1-mediated oncogenesis. HBZ was first identified as a binding partner for the cAMP-response element binding protein-2 (CREB-2) by yeast two-hybrid screening. Promoters for both the sHBZ and usHBZ genes are TATA-less. the transcription factor Sp1 has been demonstrated to be important for TATA-less promoter activity. unHBZ proteins differ in only seven amino acids at their N-terminal AD domains. the half-life of sHBZ is much longer than that of usHBZ in ATL cells. HBZ promotes binding to the mixed-lineage leukemia surface of the KIX domain. interaction inhibits binding of MLL to the KIX domain while enhancing binding of the transcription factor c-Myb to the opposite surface of KIX. HBZ fulfills its oncogenic functions mainly through regulating HTLV-1 5' LTR transcription. HBZ expression enhances the proliferative capacity of HTLV-1-infected cells and plays a critical role in cell survival. HBZ RNA increased the number of CD4+ T cells and attenuated cell death by activating the transcription of the survivin gene, which inhibits apoptosis. HBZ/miRNA-mediated downregulation of OBFC2A expression triggers both cell proliferation and genomic instability. HBZ suppresses the canonical Wnt pathway while enhancing the proliferation and migration of ATL cells by increasing expression of the noncanonical Wnt5a. HBZ attenuates the DNA binding ability of FoxO3a and sequesters the inactive form of FoxO3a in the nucleus. further study has identified that HBZ inhibited the expression of Bim by epigenetic alterations and histone modifications in the Bim promoter region. NF-B signaling is a well-established mediator of host immunity. current data support the view that Tax may facilitate cell proliferation and survival in the early stages of HTLV-1 infection. HBZ interacted with key components of the TGF- pathway to form a ternary complex of HBZ/Smad3/p300 that enhanced TGF-/Smad transcriptional responses in a p300-dependent manner. HBZ-induced Foxp3 expression could be a mechanism for the increase of Foxp3+ Treg cells in vitro and in vivo [46] HBZ transgenic mice were highly susceptible to intravaginal infection with herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) the production of IFN- by CD4+ T cells was shown to be suppressed in HBZ-Tg mice. HBZ suppresses host cell signaling pathways that are critical for T-cell immune response, such as NF-B, AP-1, and c-Jun. HBZ impairs the suppressive function of Treg cells by binding to Foxp3 and NFAT. iTreg cells of HBZ-Tg mice tend to lose Foxp3 expression, leading to increased IFN-expressing proinflammatory cells. HBZ is not required for efficient infectivity or HTLV-1-mediated immortalization of primary human T lymphocytes in vitro. however, HBZ enhanced infectivity and persistence of HTLV-1 in inoculated rabbits. HBZ is dispensable for enhancing viral replication and persistent infection. HBZ interacts with p300/CBP and disrupts the interaction between tax and p300/CBP. the two LXXLL-like motifs in the AD domain of HBZ mediate the interaction specifically through the KIX domain of the p300/CBP coactivator [42]. HBZ RNA increased the number of CD4+ T cells and attenuated cell death by activating the transcription of the survivin gene, which inhibits apoptosis. HBZ overcame the suppressive effect of C/EBP on cell growth, leading to cell proliferation. HBZ/miRNA-mediated downregulation of OBFC2A expression triggers cell proliferation and genomic instability. HBZ suppresses the canonical Wnt pathway while enhancing the proliferation and migration of ATL cells by increasing expression of the noncanonical Wnt5a. HBZ can activate JunD-induced transcription by forming heterodimers with JunD. HTLV-1 suppresses apoptosis of infected cells by the interactions of viral proteins with host factors. HBZ inhibits the transcription of a proapoptotic gene Bim. HBZ attenuates the DNA binding ability of FoxO3a and sequesters the inactive form of FoxO3a in the nucleus. HBZ modulates tax-mediated viral replication and NF-B activation. NF-B signaling is a well-established mediator of host immunity. current data support the view that Tax may facilitate cell proliferation and survival in the early stages of HTLV-1 infection. HTLV-1 infected T cells are resistant to growth-inhibitory effect of TGF-. the active TGF- pathway does not impair the leukemic growth of ATL cells. HBZ interacted with Smad2/3, key components of the TGF- pathway. HBZ transgenic mice were highly susceptible to intravaginal infection with herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) the production of IFN- by CD4+ T cells was shown to be suppressed in HBZ-Tg mice [81]. HBZ inhibits cell-mediated immunity in vivo by interfering with the host cell signaling pathway. one-third of HBZ-Tg mice developed T-cell lymphomas after a long latent period. more effector/memory and regulatory CD4+ T cells were detected in the HBZ transgenic mice. HBZ impairs the suppressive function of Treg cells by binding to Foxp3 and NFAT. HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 exhibit less than 30% homology to HBZ. HBZ is not required for efficient infectivity or HTLV-1-mediated immortalization of primary human T lymphocytes in vitro. HBZ enhanced infectivity and persistence of HTLV-1 in inoculated rabbits. current findings support the view that HBZ is indispensable for leukemogenesis by HTLV-1. further studies are needed to elucidate the precise molecular mechanisms by which HBZ induces oncogenesis."}
