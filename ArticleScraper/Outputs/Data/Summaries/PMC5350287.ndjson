{"summary": "reemergence of cholera to the Americas in 1991, the plague outbreak in India in 1994, and the emergence of SARS outbreak in 2002-2003. reemergence of cholera to the Americas in 1991, the plague outbreak in India in 1994, and most recently Zika outbreak in 2015 proved that thought wrong. EVD is one of the notorious emerging infectious diseases that endanger the human lives from time to time. precision public health is a state-of-the-art concept in the new era of public health research and its application in health care. the concept of precision public health evolved within the last two to three years. the emerging areas of precession public health are improving methodologies for early detection of pathogens and infectious disease outbreaks. simulation study epidemiology is the study of distribution and determinants of health related states or events. deterministic model is based on the average characteristic of the population parameters under study. stochastic model contains randomness of elements. population who are at risk Exposed (E) Total number of population who came in contact with a disease person and carrying the infective agent Infected (I) Number of exposed population recovering from the disease and no longer infectious to others. it also includes the population who are resistant to that infection by means of immunization or chemoprophylaxis or previous infection. in case of Ebola virus, humans are not infectious, until they develop symptoms. in case of Ebola virus, humans are not infectious, until they develop symptoms. Spatiotemporal Epidemiological Modeler (STEM) is an open source tool developed by IBM Corp. it is designed to help public health specialists, data scientists, biomedical researchers, and policy makers to create and simulate spatiotemporal modelling of transmission of emerging and reemerging infectious diseases. simulation study based on deterministic compartmental model is most commonly applied in epidemiology. simulation is an attempt to model a real-life or hypothetical epidemic situation on a computer so that it can be studied to see how the system works. hypothetical spread of EVD in India with time was simulated. the same dynamics of EVD transmission that was observed in the recent outbreak in west africa during 2014\u20132016. in a fixed population, N = S(t) + E(t) + I(t) + R(t) only those diseases can be explained by this SIR model. in case of Ebola virus, humans are not infectious, until they develop symptoms. there were few assumptions for this model related to this study. at the very beginning of the epidemic there was a constant number of infectious individuals. dI/dt = 0. for simulation purpose, it was assumed that one EVD case was reported at New Delhi on 01.01. 2017. simulation result in map view was represented at 4-month interval up to 2 years. predicted numbers of exposed individuals, infectious patients, and deaths were logged in data logger. total population of india is susceptible to EVD as on 01.01.2017. precision public health is a concept that guides precise interventional strategies to address public health problems among precisely defined population using precise surveillance data. concept of precision public health was applied in different aspects of epidemic management, that is, preparedness, response, and mitigation. it is possible to model and compare the effect of different interventional strategies at different time frame, to address the epidemic effectively and efficiently. a spatiotemporal modelling of EVD spread in west africa was done by Pigott et al. in 2016 and Chretien et al. in 2015. world is not prepared enough to reap the benefits of precision public health. government leaders, policy makers, biomedical researchers, epidemiologists, public health specialists, global health workers, data scientists, and computer science and information technology experts need to put their hands together."}
