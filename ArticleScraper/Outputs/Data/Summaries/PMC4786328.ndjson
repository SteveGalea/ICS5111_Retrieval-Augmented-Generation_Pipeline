{"summary": "basic reproduction ratio (R0) is the most widely used parameter in epidemic theory. it is defined as the average number of secondary cases produced when a single infected individual is introduced into a fully susceptible population. if Rt1, each case will produce less than one secondary case, and the epidemic will tend to die out, even if no further measures are applied. bluetongue is a viral disease caused by the genus Orbivirus within the family Reoviridae. two new serotypes BTV-25 and BTV-26 have been identified. bluetongue is transmitted between hosts almost exclusively by bites of certain species of Culicoides biting midges. ruminant population comprises approximately 2.6 million sheep, 1.2 million goats and 0.6 million cattle, divided into 13346 sheep flocks, 10789 goat flocks, 8745 cattle herds and 4339 mixed farms. a total of 4421 infected farms, 3699 in small ruminant flocks and 722 in mixed farms (sheep, goat or cattle in the same farm) were included in the analysis. the approximate date of infection of each of the 4421 farms was estimated. from the date of infection of the farm, the date of onset of infectiousness on that farm may be calculated. the time from infection to viraemia (TITV) in the hosts, between 1 and 6 days. for each infected farm, the day a farm got infected, plus the TITV, plus the number of days needed to complete the EIP, determines the day from which a given farm became infectious. once a farm became infectious, it was assumed to remain infectious until November (when the last infections of the epidemic occurred). we calculated the number of farms infected by each of the 4421 farms affected throughout the epidemic: Ni (Step 3 in S1 Fig) the case-reproduction ratio (Rt) for a given focus (x) and time period (t) was calculated as the average value of Ni of the farms infected in focus x during the period t (Step 4 in S1 Fig). two new variables, median and 95% upper limit of the CI of Culicoides captures (sum of the 3 species) were also created. models for maximum abundance of Culicoides vector species were developed from national surveillance datasets of weekly OVI light trap catches at approximately 300 sites across the UK and Spain covering a five year period. the top 20 best models were selected for each species to make predictions at new sites across western Europe [23]. predictions for the maximum annual abundance from each of the top 20 models were averaged for each species, and weighted by their relative support in the data. all predictions included a 95% credible interval. land cover data were obtained from corine Land Cover 2006 at a 100m resolution. it was used to create an index of the suitability of landcover for movement of infected midges around the landscape. landcover categories that were wholly unsuitable for farms or midges were assigned a high cost of movement value (2) while agricultural or grassland/shrubland categories with a high percentage of farms were assigned the lowest cost of zero. data collection Andalusia is a region located in the south of Spain. the ruminant population comprises approximately 2.6 million sheep, 1.2 million goats and 0.6 million cattle, divided into 13346 sheep flocks, 10789 goat flocks, 8745 cattle herds and 4339 mixed farms. in sheep, the average incubation period is between 6 and 8 days. in sheep, the average incubation period is between 6 and 8 days. a conservative delay of twice that period (14 days) was considered between the infection of the farm and the detection of the clinical signs by the farmer. the virogenesis rate on a given day represented the proportion of the EIP completed that day [14] for each infected farm, the day a farm got infected, plus the TITV, plus the number of days needed to complete the EIP determines the day from which a given farm became infectious. for each infected farm, the source of its infection (parent farm) was selected using an algorithm. the method developed by Haydon and collaborators [4] allows the case-reproduction ratios to be estimated for different areas and periods. the difficulty lies in differentiating local transmission from a new focus. a new infection can still be considered as local transmission. data on the population of domestic ruminants in a raster format was provided by the Autonomous Government of Andalusia. two new variables, median and 95% upper limit of the CI of Culicoides captures (sum of the 3 species) were also created. models for maximum abundance of Culicoides vector species were developed from national surveillance datasets of weekly OVI light trap catches. an out of sample predictive r2 was calculated for each of the 20 splits in the data into testing (75%) and training (25%) subsamples. all possible combinations of variables were ranked according to their out of sample predictive ability. the top 20 best models were selected for each species to make predictions at new sites across western Europe [23] a variable to account for the proportion of a given focus area at a given time period, overlapped by other foci was also created. elevation and slope were also included as variables to be assessed. a terrain ruggedness index was defined as the mean of the absolute differences between the value of a cell and the value of its eight surrounding cells. the Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient was used to assess the correlation between the different environmental predictors included in the analysis. in those cases where the correlation was higher than 0.9 the variable with the higher biological significance was retained. a mixed-effects model was used within the nlme library [25] implemented in R [19]. by October it had decreased to 0.02 and remained close to 0 in November. there were no significant differences in Rt values when algorithm 2 (equally proportional within a distance) was applied, except that values for July and August were a bit lower (3.3 and 1.9), and for September and October values were a bit higher (0.9 and 0.2, respectively) the high value obtained in week 1 is likely to be the result of the Rt value in focus 4 (where the epidemic starts) estimations for weeks 2 and 3 are probably linked to introduction and spread within focus 20 (the largest focus in the epidemic) between weeks 3 and 9 (mid-October), increase of EIPs becomes steeper. between weeks 3 and 9 (mid-October), increase of EIPs becomes steeper. between weeks 10 and 16 (mid-October), increase of EIPs becomes steeper. correlation analysis of different environmental predictors potentially related to Rt showed that the estimated median maximum abundance of C. imicola was correlated with the 95% upper limit of the credible interval of estimated maximum abundance of C. imicola. however, only slope was retained for further analysis. estimate standard error t P EIP -0.0041 0.0020 -2.05 0.041 Slope 0.49 0.29 1.66 0.098 Sheep density (animals/km2) 0.14 0.044 3.20 0.0015 Overlapping (proportion) for each increase of 1% in the area overlapped, the value of Rt was reduced by 0.0041. the fifth farm was infected on the 4th of July in the southernmost area of the province of Cadiz, but 46 km away from the first infected farm. none of those farms became infectious before the 5th of July, and therefore were not epidemiologically linked. by the 26th of July movement restrictions were imposed in Cadiz, the majority of Malaga and Seville, and the eastern area of Huelva. andalusia is a critical point of entry for bluetongue virus strains into Europe. despite differences in the epidemiology of BTV, the number of infected farms progressively increased, from only 113 farms infected in July to a maximum of 2089 in September. the number of infected farms progressively increased, from only 113 farms infected in July to a maximum of 2089 in September. when algorithm 1 was applied, the number of potential parent farms was much lower as compared to when algorithm 2 (equal probability within a distance) the probability of infection was shared among all the infectious farms within 5 kilometers. with algorithm 1, the 20% most infective farms infected 87% of the total farms affected throughout the whole epidemic. the values obtained with algorithm 3 (proportional to distance) were similar to those obtained with algorithm 1. the 20% most infective farms were responsible for the infection of 88% of the total farms affected. 62% of the farms did not contribute to any further infections. the delay observed in many foci between the initial infection and the secondary cases arising as a result of local spread may have been due to a lack of suitable conditions for disease spread in that period. the infected host needs to reach the viraemic stage and then the local vectors need to complete the EIP before onwards transmission can occur. vaccination was probably effective at preventing the persistence of the disease in the following year. temperature is also one of the main determinants of Culicoides abundance, though the effect of temperature may interact with moisture availability [30]. differences in the adaptation to temperature of the main vectors of the BTV-1 epidemic in Andalusia (Culicoides imicola) and the BTV-8 epidemic in northern Europe (Culicoides obsoletus) the first five farms affected in the epidemic were infected between the 25th of June and the 4th of July. this almost simultaneous infection suggests that the BTV-1 epidemic in Andalusia in 2007 may have not been the result of a single introduction, but several almost simultaneous introductions at distant locations. the fact that these farms were located far away from each other suggests that the outbreak may have not been the result of a single introduction. the movement restrictions imposed in Andalusia were not able to stop the spread of the disease. 35 out of 58 foci of the epidemic were reported during the 10 days that followed those restrictions. failure of movement restrictions to stop BTV spread is in accordance with previous BTV epidemics. the density of cattle did not have a significant effect on the level of spread. a drop off in vector numbers in autumn may be coincident with the lengthening of the extrinsic incubation period found to significantly reduce Rt in this period. estimating the between-herd reproduction ratio for bluetongue directly from empirical epidemi data provides the best opportunity for understanding spatial and temporally variability in transmission. this is because relatively few simplifying assumptions and entomological parameters are required and a wide spectrum of environmental conditions that may impact BTV is potentially encompassed within farms across the whole epidemic region. andalusia is one of the main entry point for orbiviral diseases into Europe. the south of Spain is one of the main entry point for these diseases into Europe."}
