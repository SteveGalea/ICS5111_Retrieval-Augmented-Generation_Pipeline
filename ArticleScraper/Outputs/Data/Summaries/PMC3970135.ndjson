{"summary": "feline viral rhinotracheitis is a highly infectious upper respiratory tract infection of felids. there have been no documented reports on FHV-1 in the past few years. fewer than 120 captive tigers in china are suitable for reintroduction. a target fragment of 292 bp in length was amplified by PCR/RT-PCR. the tested specimens were positive for FHV-1 but negative for other tested pathogens, including canine/feline distemper virus (CDV/FeDV) and feline calicivirus (FCV) phylogenetic tree based on the nucleotide sequences of the TK gene showed that the isolate investigated in this study, was closely related to the ten isolates of FHV-1. all isolates of FeHV-1 appear to be relatively similar, as they antigenically belong to one serotype. cultures were positive only for FHV-1. positive PCR products of TK gene from trachea homogenates shared 100% homology. cytopathic effect observed in cells inoculated with trachea homogenates. pyrexia began at day 4 post-inoculation and continued for 14 days. fever was detected on the 10th day and the 13th day respectively. positive results were found on the 6th day and 16th day for the EG group cats. tiger exhibited uniform clinical symptoms and shed FHV-1 virus. pyrexia, inappetence, and serous ocular and nasal discharge were observed in the cats. a long period of virus shedding was observed in the cats. retrospective investigation was conducted after the virus isolation and identification. negative PCR results were found for swab samples collected from stray cats and captive leopards and tigers. it is very regrettable that neither prior sera nor post mortem sera were stored enabling seroconversion analysis. a 253 bp sequence was obtained, and alignment analysis determined that the TK gene cloned in this study shared a high identity with that of other FHV-1 isolates. a 566 bp fragment of the gB gene was also cloned, and was found to share 100% identity with that of other FHV-1 isolates. ten isolates of TK gene were identified by sequence analysis. all isolates of FeHV-1 appear to be relatively similar, as they antigenically belong to one serotype. cytopathic effect observed in cells inoculated with trachea homogenates. electron micrograph of cell cultures revealed circular or oval particles. size bars indicate 200 nm. cat challenge test with the Virus Isolate 2.1.3.1. positive results appeared on the 6th day post-inoculation. PCR was used to detect FHV-1 DNA extracted from the specimens. positive results were found on the 10th day and 16th day for the EG group cats and the control cat respectively. the tested specimens were positive for FHV-1 but negative for other tested pathogens, including canine/feline distemper virus (CDV/FeDV) and feline calicivirus (FCV) the authors were able to narrow the range of the laboratory examinations. the subsequent isolation and identification methods focused on FHV-1 were based on the positive result. phylogenetic tree based on the nucleotide sequences of the TK gene was constructed with MEGA [10]. all isolates of FeHV-1 appear to be relatively similar, as they antigenically belong to one serotype. alignment analysis determined that the TK gene cloned in this study shared a high identity (99% to 100%) with that of other FHV-1 isolates. a 566 bp fragment of the gB gene was also cloned, and was found to share 100% identity with that of other FHV-1 isolates. phylogenetic tree based on the nucleotide sequences showed that the isolate investigated, was closely related to the ten isolates of F cytopathic effect (CPE) characterized by cell rounding, pyknosis, \u2018Fleece-Pulling\u2019 to the thyrsoid and degeneration of the cell monolayer. positive PCR products of TK gene of FHV-1 from trachea homogenates shared 100% homology with FHV-1 isolates. noculation, the cats in the IG (inoculated group) exhibited sneezing and increasing palpebral secretion. subsequently, their nostrils were completely blocked with purulent secretions resulting from thin nasal discharge. after the 18th day, the cats recovered completely and exhibited no signs of infection. cat no. days post-inoculation 0 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 1# + + + + + + + + 2# + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + pyrexia began at day 4 post-inoculation and continued for 14 days. fever was detected on the 10th day and the 13th day respectively. positive results were found on the 6th day post-inoculation. the only virus detected in the trachea homogenates was FHV-1. the full genome of the virus isolated in cell culture is being sequenced. other agents causing respiratory disease were excluded as possible pathogens. tiger was initially diagnosed with rhinotracheitis, and only trachea samples were obtained for laboratory examination after it died. trachea samples were ground for 3 minutes in a homogenate with a beveller. trachea specimen was ground for 3 minutes in a homogenate with a beveller. PCR/RT-PCR Assays Viral genomic RNA and DNA were extracted from the supernatant obtained in Section 3.2 using a Multisource Genomic DNA/RNA Miniprep Kit (Axygen, Hangzhou, China) the supernatant was fractionated into two centrifuge tubes for later tests. denaturalization: 94 \u00b0C, 60 s.

[23] 3.3.2. gene Cloning and Sequence Analysis The target fragments observed by agarose gel electrophoresis were extracted by a DNA Gel Extraction Kit (Axygen, Hangzhou, China) the flasks were incubated for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO2. after gentle rotation, the flasks were incubated for 3 days at 37 \u00b0C. the monolayers were removed, and the monolayers were washed three times with MEM without FBS. 0.5 mL sample/cat containing 106 TCID50 of the SZ12 strain was mock-inoculated with 0.5 mL PBS/cat. each cat\u2019s temperature was taken, and clinical signs were observed daily. the tiger was initially diagnosed with rhinotracheitis.
