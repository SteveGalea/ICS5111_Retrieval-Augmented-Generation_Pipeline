{"summary": "patients aged 6 months with ARI were enrolled from the population of community-dwelling individuals living in the central region of the Marshfield Epidemiologic Study Area. the study focused on children living in MESA who were 6\u201359 months old at the start of each influenza season. the study focused on children living in MESA who were enrolled and tested for influenza to estimate vaccine effectiveness. the parent or legal guardian was interviewed at the time of enrollment. sample aliquots were stored at 70\u00b0C until the current study was initiated. the enrollment period was extended in 2009\u20132010 due to the pandemic. the sensitivity and specificity was 98% and 99%, respectively, for RSV. the 2009\u20132010 season included the time period in which the vast majority of pandemic influenza activity occurred in Wisconsin. estimates for influenza in the pandemic wave (October 4, 2009\u2013November 6, 2009) and the planned seasonal (November 30, 2009\u2013May 8, 2010) enrollment periods within the 2009\u20132010 season were summed to generate the standardized combined estimate. this was necessary because extrapolation of influenza positivity rates among patients enrolled during the pandemic would not be appropriate. the Marshfield Epidemiologic Study Area (MESA) is a dynamic, population-based cohort of approximately 54 000 residents living in 14 zip codes surrounding Marshfield, Wisconsin. the electronic medical record captures approximately 93% of outpatient visits, 93% of hospital discharges, and 99% of deaths for the MESA population. the study focused on children living in MESA who were 6\u201359 months old at the start of each influenza season. the enrollment period was extended in 2009\u20132010 due to the pandemic. multiplex RT-PCR testing to detect additional viruses was subsequently approved by the IRB with a waiver of informed consent. al incidence was defined as the number of medically attended cases per 10 000 community residents 6\u201359 months old. all incidence estimates were standardized to weeks 40 through 18 (31 weeks from early October through early May) using Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene surveillance data for RSV and influenza [16]. analytic weights, offsets, and robust variance estimation were used to estimate seasonal incidence of RSV in 2009\u20132010. the same procedure was undertaken to estimate seasonal incidence and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) influenza, human metapneumovirus, human rhinovirus, coronavirus, and parainfluenza (types 1\u20134) were each detected as virus infections in 8% or more of children (5% or more as single infections) twenty-one percent of samples were negative for all viral targets.

Table 3. Estimated Seasonal Incidence and 95% CL of Medically Attended RSV and Influenza in children 59 months of age by season and age group. seasonal influenza incidence was highest among children 24\u201359 months of age overall. but individual seasons showed variation with respect to age group with the highest seasonal influenza incidence. seasonal incidence was highest in 2007\u20132008 and lowest in 2006\u20132007. 63 56 72 99 Percentage of statewide influenza cases occurring during study enrollment perioda 80 92 78 82 No. of children in community cohort 2816 3073 2854 2800 No. (%) of children with 1 MAARI visit during enrollment period 802 (28.5) 1012 (32.9) 1026 (36.0) 1353 (48.3) No. (%) of children with valid test resultsb 458 (57.1) 405 (40.0) 555 (54.1) 646 (47.7) Estimated Season seasonal influenza incidence was highest in 2007\u20132008 and lowest in 2006\u20132007 season. seasonal influenza incidence was highest among children 24\u201359 months of age overall. seasonal influenza incidence was highest among children 24\u201359 months of age overall. the seasonal incidence of both RSV and influenza was highest among children 24\u201359 months old. the overall incidence of influenza was similar in 2007\u20132008 and during 2009\u20132010, which included the pandemic. seasonal RSV incidence (982\u20132531 cases per 10 000) was substantially higher than what was reported in each of the prior studies. we recruited from a well defined population cohort with complete healthcare utilization data. we used the same cohort to generate RSV and influenza incidence estimates. influenza incidence can vary greatly from season to season, and patterns of healthcare utilization can vary over time. progressive increases in vaccine recommendations and coverage may have influenced the number of influenza-related outpatient visits. bocavirus was coinfected with multiplex PCR array. this may have contributed to the relatively small proportion of children."}
