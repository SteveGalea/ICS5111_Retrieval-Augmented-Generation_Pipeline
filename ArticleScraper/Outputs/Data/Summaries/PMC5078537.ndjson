{"summary": "cancer is the leading cause of death worldwide, with 8.2 million deaths reported worldwide in 2012. common treatment options include hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), chemotherapeutic drugs, and surgical resection. HSCT is a curative therapy for many types of hematologic malignancies and immune deficiency diseases. the lowest risk occurs in solid-tumor patients on standard chemotherapy. the posttransplant period may be divided into three stages: preengraftment (less than 4 weeks), early postengraftment (3 weeks to 3 months), and late postengraftment (>3 months) stages. defect in innate immunity translates into initial susceptibility to bacteria, Candida, and herpes simplex virus (HSV) during preengraftment or early engraftment period. cosal barrier, cellular immunity, humoral immunity CNS, Enterococcus spp., viridans streptococci, Gram-negative bacteria, Legionella species, C. difficile Duration and severity of neutropenia is longer for HM/HSCT than ST 6, 9 Viral Allo-HSCT, HM, auto-HSCT, ST Lymphopenia, GVHD, high corticosteroids. bacterial infections accounted for 30% of all infections detected in two cohorts of allogeneic HSCT recipients, bone marrow and peripheral blood stem cell recipients. the most frequently recovered bacteria were coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) and Enterococcus species. the most commonly reported GNB include Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter species. particularly worrisome is the emergence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E), multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas species, and prophylaxis is routinely used, especially for high-risk patients. the combination of routine prophylaxis, surveillance cultures, and other host variables translates into even lower sensitivity for blood cultures. new commercially available methodologies are additional tools that provide rapid preliminary preliminary data from positive blood cultures. tine Legionella culture for respiratory specimens may be warranted in cancer patients. however, these cultures require special media and an extended incubation period, which may result in a significant delay in diagnosis. HSCT recipients have an increased risk for Clostridium difficile infections (CDI), especially in the early preengraftment period. the incidence of infections caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) in oncology patients is low (0.4 to 5%) but has increased over the last few decades. the incidence and epidemiology of NTM species vary across centers. bacterial infections accounted for 30% of all infections detected in two cohorts of allogeneic HSCT recipients, bone marrow and peripheral blood stem cell recipients. most frequently recovered bacteria were coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) and Enterococcus species. the most commonly reported GNB include Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter species. particularly worrisome is the emergence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E), multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas species, and surveillance blood cultures are collected at predetermined intervals posttransplantation (8). the combination of routine prophylaxis, surveillance cultures, and other host variables translates into even lower sensitivity for blood cultures. new commercially available methodologies include molecular blood culture panels, peptide nucleic acid fluorescent probes, and mass spectrometry. Routine Legionella culture for respiratory specimens may be warranted in cancer patients. but these cultures require special media and an extended incubation period, which may result in a significant delay in diagnosis. the use of urinary antigen tests provides an additional diagnostic option, but the sensitivities of these tests vary. diarrhea is a frequent symptom in many HSCT patients. detection of C. difficile is problematic in differentiating CDI from other causes of diarrhea, both infectious and noninfectious. mycobacterial culture remains the gold standard for diagnosing mycobacterial infection. a particular challenge in cancer patients is the diagnosis of mycobacterial infections following an incidental finding of acid-fast bacilli (AFB), detected during staining of biopsy samples submitted to rule out malignancies. HSCT recipients are particularly at high risk for developing CMV disease until the T-cell response is restored. current management strategies of transplant patients have resulted in a decreased incidence of early (i.e., first 4 months posttransplant) CMV disease, especially CMV pneumonia. molecular quantitative quantitative CMV tests provide earlier detection of CMV viremia than pp65 antigenemia tests. increased sensitivity may result in unnecessary prolonged therapy and increased toxicity. PTLD results from the reactivation of EBV in infected B-cell lymphocytes. incidence rates of PTLD in allogeneic HSCT recipients range from 0.45 to 29%. other clinical manifestations of EBV infections in HSCT include enteritis, hepatitis, encephalitis, and pneumonia. BV became available, providing an opportunity for standardization of laboratory-developed assays. disseminated HSV infection is now uncommon due to prophylaxis of patients. most infections result from reactivation of latent HSV (6). a laboratory-developed test (LDT) using the Roche HSV 1/2 analyte-specific reagent (ASR) were 96.2% and 97.9%, respectively (32) the gold standard for diagnosis of HSV central nervous system infection is molecular testing. diagnosis of other HSV syndromes, aside from mucocutaneous lesions, may be challenging. standardization of PCR, T2 Biosystems, panfungal IVD PCR/sequencing assays Parasitic Ova and parasites exam, serology, molecular methods None Need for multiple stools, depressed antibody response, no standard molecular assays Standardization of PCR, IVD Toxoplasma PCR a DFA, direct fluorescent-antibody assay. c Includes several IVD-cleared commercial assays. diagnostic challenge that is specific to HHV-6 is the differentiation of chromosomally integrated HHV-6 (ciHHV-6) from actively replicating HHV-6. in approximately less than 1% of the population, HHV-6 can integrate into the host telomeres and be transmitted through germ cells. a second challenge is the lack of standardization across tests, making it difficult to compare viral loads obtained across centers. adenoviruses are associated with a variety of clinical syndromes. adenoviruses are associated with pneumonia, nephritis, hemorrhagic cystitis, hepatitis, and colitis. adenovirus enteritis is caused by serotypes 40/41, but in cancer patients, adenovirus enteritis can be caused by any subtype. CMV-seropositive HSCT recipients are particularly at high risk for developing CMV disease until the T-cell response is restored. current management strategies of transplant patients have resulted in a decreased incidence of early (i.e., first 4 months posttransplant) CMV disease, especially CMV pneumonia. quantitative assays used in the laboratory for measuring CMV viremia have a significant impact on the clinical management of transplant patients. sensitivity may result in unnecessary prolonged therapy, but results need to be interpreted in the appropriate clinical context. quantitative assays used in the laboratory for measuring CMV viremia have a significant impact on the clinical management of transplant patients. a clear understanding of the test performance characteristics, including the specimen type used, the limit of detection, the limit of quantification, the linear range, and the reproducibility of the assay, is necessary. quantitative molecular tests in blood samples are the most useful assays for the detection of EBV reactivation and for monitoring of viral load in blood in PTLD. these assays may also be used to distinguish between asymptomatic and low-level transient reactivation, which does not warrant treatment. studies have shown significant variability in EBV viral loads generated with laboratory-developed tests across centers. the risk of HSV infections in cancer patients varies with the underlying disease or chemotherapy treatment. commercial assays are FDA cleared for the qualitative detection and differentiation of HSV-1 and HSV-2 in cutaneous and mucocutaneous lesions. sensitivity and specificity ranging between 95 and 100% compared to viral culture. one commercial test, the Simplexa HSV-1&2 (Focus Diagnostics), is FDA cleared for the detection and differentiation of HSV-1 and HSV-2. direct from sample tests, direct from sample susceptibility testing Viral Viral culture, DFA/IFA, molecular methods FilmArray respiratory panel, FilmArray gastrointestinal panel, Luminex gastrointestinal panel, Xpert Norovirus, HSV 1/2 (lesions),c Simplexa HSV 1/2 (lesions),c Simplexa HSV 1&2 (CSF), more WHO IS for standardization of other tests, IVD quantitative assays for herpesviruses, quantitative respiratory virus commercial assays are FDA cleared for the qualitative detection and differentiation of HSV-1 and HSV-2 in cutaneous and mucocutaneous lesions. sensitivity and specificity ranging between 95 and 100% compared to viral culture. many have a turnaround time of less than 4 h compared to days for culture. quantitative PCR assays for herpesviruses, differentiation between infection and disease WHO IS, more WHO IS for standardization of other tests, IVD quantitative assays for herpesviruses, quantitative respiratory virus PCR, mRNA or sensitive and rapid antigen tests Fungal Fungal culture. a diagnostic challenge that is specific to HHV-6 is the differentiation of chromosomally integrated HHV-6 (ciHHV-6) from actively replicating HHV-6. in approximately less than 1% of the population, HHV-6 can integrate into the host telomeres and be transmitted through germ cells. a diagnostic challenge that is specific to HHV-6 is the differentiation of chromosomally integrated HHV-6 (ciHHV-6) from actively replicating HHV-6. in approximately less than 1% of the population, HHV-6 can integrate into the host telomeres and be transmitted through germ cells, resulting in high viral loads. attributable adenovirus mortality rate was 22%, and in patients with adenovirus viremia, the mortality rate was higher, at 44% (40). however, the mortality rate was significantly lower in a cohort of patients with an alemtuzumab-based stem cell transplant, where only 1 patient died from disseminated adenovirus infection (41). quantitative PCR tests are not standardized, making the establishment of valid actionable threshold challenging. adenovirus enteritis is caused by serotypes 40/41, but in cancer patients, adenovirus enteritis can be caused by any subtype. this presents a challenge for the laboratory, as these two subtypes are the only two included in most commercially available gastrointestinal (GI) panels. symptoms resolve within 24- to 48 h in healthy patients. in HSCT recipients and other neutropenic cancer patients, symptoms may last between 7 days and 90 days. the importance of other GI viruses, including astrovirus and sapovirus, is less well established, as methods for routine recovery of these viruses were not available until recently. a limitation of RT-PCR for noroviruses is the recognition that oncology patients are often chronic shedders. unless molecular typing is performed on all positive norovirus samples, distinguishing established and new infections is not easily accomplished. astrovirus and sapovirus are the most sensitive laboratory method for the diagnosis of norovirus infections in HSCT recipients and patients with hematologic malignancies. the inclusion of astrovirus and sapovirus on molecular GI panels will allow for routine testing of symptomatic patients. these patients are at an increased risk for developing severe complications, including lower respiratory tract infections, airflow obstruction, and bronchiolitis obliterans (49). rare reports have been published on the incidence of human metapneumovirus (hMPV) in cancer patients, with reported incidence rates ranging from 2 to 7%. complications and fatality rates similar to those of RSV. commercial multiplex assays for detection of respiratory viruses are now available for testing. the significance of extended shedding as detected by PCR is unclear. but its impact on patient care is significant. additional studies are necessary to clearly understand the kinetics of respiratory viruses in oncology patients. Invasive aspergillosis (IA) most commonly presents as a pulmonary infection and remains associated with significant mortality in cancer patients. other species often recovered include A. niger, A. flavus, and A. terreus. patients with hematologic malignancies account for 50 to 90% of reported cases. identified risk factors for increased mortality included active neutropenia Trichosporon species fungemia and admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) serial monitoring of serum galactomannan or -d-glucans can increase sensitivity. serial monitoring of both galactomannan and -d-glucans can increase sensitivity. serial monitoring of serum galactomannan or -d-glucans can increase sensitivity. the current definition of IFI does not include the use of molecular tests (74) Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) has significantly reduced the incidence of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) from 16% in HSCT recipients to less than 1% (75, 76) the prevalence of P. jirovecii infection without disease remains unclear. -d-glucans is produced by various fungal pathogens. the exact threshold that provides specificity for PCP in oncology patients remains to be determined. an increase in fluconazole-resistant non-albicans Candida species has been observed in geographically diverse centers (61) patients with hematologic malignancies account for 50 to 90% of reported cases. patients with hematologic malignancies account for 50 to 90% of reported cases. the utility of antigen tests is varied and highly dependent on the patient population, exposure to antifungal prophylaxis, and the responsible mold. serial monitoring of serum galactomannan or -d-glucans can increase sensitivity, although the exact frequency of testing is unknown. laboratory-developed molecular assays generally have higher sensitivity than culture but limited clinical specificity and limited range, only targeting a few organisms. sensitivity and specificity ranging from 75 to 100% and 75 to 95% depending on the target and specimen type (72, 73) Molecular methods (e.g., PCR) have demonstrated a significantly higher sensitivity for detecting the presence of P. jirovecii. prevalence of P. jirovecii infection without disease, often labeled airway \u201ccolonization,\u201d remains unclear. T. gondii infections occur most commonly from reactivation of a latent infection following transplantation. risk of reactivation is higher for toxoplasma-seropositive allogeneic HSCT recipients and lower in seronegative autologous HSCT recipients. common method used is molecular surveillance using nucleic acid amplification tests (e.g., PCR) at various intervals posttransplantation for a predetermined period, depending on the centers and the type of transplants. both qualitative and quantitative PCRs are used, and all the available methods are nonstandardized LDTs with different but generally similar performance characteristics. serological screening is recommended for patients from regions of endemicity. solid-tumor oncology patients generally do not develop disseminated or hyperinfection syndrome with S. stercoralis. the primary method for diagnosis is the ova and parasites exam. the overall seroprevalence of T. gondii in allogeneic HSCT recipients is approximately 10% in the united states and 8 to 16% in Europe. the risk of reactivation is higher for toxoplasma-seropositive allogeneic HSCT recipients and lower in seronegative autologous HSCT recipients. most common method used is molecular surveillance using nucleic acid amplification tests (e.g., PCR) at various intervals posttransplantation for a predetermined period, depending on the centers and the type of transplants (e.g., cord blood HSCT versus autologous HSCT). both qualitative and quantitative PCRs are used, and all the available methods are nonstandardized LDTs with different but generally similar performance characteristics (77). HSCT recipients and hematologic malignancy patients are at increased risk of developing Strongyloides stercoralis hyperinfection syndrome. serological screening is recommended for patients from regions of endemicity or those with the appropriate travel history prior to HSCT. timely diagnosis of S. stercoralis can be challenging, requiring a high degree of suspicion. patients may present with transient mild eosinophilia and nonspecific symptoms, including diarrhea, skin rash, dry cough, dyspnea, and wheezing. primary method for diagnosis remains the ova and parasites exam. nonspecific symptoms include diarrhea, skin rash, dry cough, dyspnea, and wheezing. the primary method for diagnosis remains the ova and parasites exam. sensitivity is 30% for one sample and 100% for 7 samples. syndromic panels and other molecular diagnostic tests have significantly improved our ability to identify pathogens with increased sensitivity and speed. this minireview presented current laboratory diagnostic methods used by clinical microbiologists supporting the care of these patients."}
