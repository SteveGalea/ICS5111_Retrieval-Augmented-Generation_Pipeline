{"summary": "flight 1 was chosen after identification of 6 passengers with confirmed pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infection. this flight came from an area that lacked community transmission. the definition of ILI was broad to capture as many persons as possible within the dataset. all passenger names, passenger sex, disease onset dates, and postal codes were cross-checked against those of passengers with known pandemic (H1N1) 2009 cases. travel details were verified for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 case-patients identified through national notification. ILI was defined as >1 symptom (cough, runny nose, sore throat, or fever) within 7\u201314 days before the flight or during the flight or 7 days after arrival. all but 4 passengers reporting symptoms had confirmation of ILI status from a qualified health professional. the increased risk of passengers contracting either laboratory-confirmed pandemic (H1N1) 2009 or an ILI (including pandemic [H1N1] 2009) was separately estimated by dividing the number of persons with the illness by the number of susceptible persons in the contact zones as described. 8 passengers had an ILI at the beginning of the 14-hour flight. for 4 of these passengers, pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infection was later laboratory confirmed; for 1 pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infection was confirmed as negative; 3 passengers were not tested. most passengers experienced onset of symptoms 3 days after flight arrival. 83%) of 24 passengers in whom an ILI developed postflight sat in aisle seats. location increased the risk of contracting an ILI by 1.8; however, it did not reach statistical significance. a cluster of passengers with symptoms before boarding were found to have positive test results for pandemic (H1N1) 2009. in 2 of these passengers, pandemic (H1N1) 2009 was laboratory confirmed; for 4 ILI was confirmed as negative for pandemic (H1N1) 2009; 1 person (seat 75G) was not tested. the risk of contracting pandemic (H1N1) 2009 postflight increased to 3.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] \u20130.5% to 3.4%) the current zone for contact tracing is defined by passengers in the same row as and within 2 rows either side of the index case-patient. 2 passengers in the same section indicated having had ILI symptoms but not being tested for pandemic (H1N1) 2009. the passenger who was symptomatic before the flight was not tested for pandemic (H1N1) 2009; of the passengers whose symptoms developed during the flight, 1 was not tested and 1 (adult in seat 33D) was tested 6 days after flight arrival. at that time, the test returned a negative result. the notifiable diseases database identified 8 passengers who had an ILI at the beginning of the 14-hour flight. for 4 of these passengers, pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infection was confirmed as negative; 3 passengers were not tested. most passengers experienced onset of symptoms 3 days after flight arrival. 7 of 16 passengers whose ILI was confirmed negative for pandemic (H1N1) 2009, and 2 of 10 passengers with ILI who were not tested. signs and symptoms reported by passengers on flight 1 with influenza-like illness, by pandemic (H1N1) 2009 testing status and results, Australia, May 2009*. disease was deemed to have spread during the flight in passengers from seats 69H/69J/69K/70H to 68K and 71K. all case-patients had positive test results for pandemic (H1N1) 2009; from 63C to 62D (neither passenger being tested); and from 84E/84F to 83G. 52 (35%) passengers responded to the survey, of whom 8 (15%) went into isolation 1 day after flight arrival, 17 (33%) by 2 days after flight arrival. the increased risk of contracting pandemic (H1N1) 2009 by sitting in those seats was 1.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] \u20130.5% to 3.4%) survey respondents were 1.3 more likely to sit in aisle seats. clustering of cases was seen with the potential for spread of either ILI or pandemic (H1N1) 2009 from passengers who were infectious before and during the flight. ILI was confirmed as negative for pandemic (H1N1) 2009; 1 person (seat 75G) was not tested. symptoms developed in 7 passengers after flight arrival; 5 of whom had negative test results for pandemic (H1N1) 2009. the current zone for contact tracing is defined by passengers in the same row as and within 2 rows either side of the index case-patient. a closer zone forming a square delimited by 2 seats in front, 2 seats behind, and 2 seats on either side of the index case-patient could be prescribed. the risk of contracting pandemic (H1N1) 2009 postflight increased to 7.7% (95% CI \u20132.6% to 17.9%) laboratory confirmed to have pandemic (H1N1) 2009. 1 passenger (seat 24K) had negative test results for pandemic influenza A. 4 passengers (seats 34A, 35B, 41G, and 63D) were not tested. spread of the virus from a region known to have sustained community transmission was to be expected and formed part of the case definition in Australia during the early phases of the pandemic (13) flight 2 originated in Singapore, where the first recorded case of the disease was on may 26, 2009 (14), 3 days after the aircraft arrived in Australia. a targeted approach to aircraft screening relies on country-specific information is not completely reliable. contact tracing and implementation of public health intervention measures after in-flight exposure to disease is time and resource intensive (21). southern Hemisphere estimates of the serial interval for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 varied from 1.5 days to 2.9 days (22,23), yet practicalities associated with disease diagnosis and contact tracing meant quarantine dates began 1\u20135 days after flight arrival. the increased risk of contracting disease as found in the current study would suggest that further limiting of the zone required for contacting exposed passengers potential limitations include lack of knowledge of health status of passengers who did not return the survey or inform health authorities of ILI symptoms after flight arrival. cross-checking of data collected by local health authorities at the time of flight arrival showed no recall bias. the spectrum of signs symptoms of passengers contracting ILI or pandemic (H1N1) 2009 varies. policies by australian authorities may have assisted in delaying the importation of identified pandemic (H1N1) 2009 cases during the first month of the recent pandemic. findings suggest that efforts to prevent importation of respiratory diseases into a community and protection of individuals from in-flight exposure to ILI may require changes in international policies of both exit screening of symptomatic passengers."}
