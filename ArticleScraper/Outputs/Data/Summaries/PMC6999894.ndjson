{"summary": "pneumonia has a higher mortality among malnourished children aged 5 years. evaluating pneumonia etiology among malnourished children may help improve empiric treatment guidelines. we enrolled hospital admitted SAM children with clinical or radiological pneumonia as cases. adenovirus (23, 6.4%), HPIV (22, 6.1%), influenza virus (16, 4.5%), and influenza virus (2, 0.6%) were most commonly detected one followed by adenovirus (26,7.9%), HMPV (5, 1.5%), HPIV (4, 1.2%), RSV (3, 0.9%), and influenza virus (2, 0.6%) were independently associated with pneumonia while compared between 178 cases and 174 controls. in Bangladesh, 36% of children aged less than five years are malnourished and 12% have severe acute malnutrition (SAM) there are scarcity of data about the etiology of pneumonia in malnourished children. there are scarcity of data about the etiology of pneumonia in malnourished children. there are no clinical guidelines for their use in low-income settings. new antivirals, vaccines, and monoclonal antibodies are also in the primitive stage of development for treating influenza, RSV, and HPIV-3infection. children who might have chance of migration to outside Dhaka city within a one-month period from admission were not enrolled in the study. a child with a history of cough with respiratory difficulty or age-specific fast breathing or lower chest wall indrawing will be defined as pneumonia [18]. children with congenital heart disease presented with features of pneumonia (cough, fast breathing, chest in-drawing and even cyanosis) secondary to congestive cardiac failure. children with severe malnutrition and pneumonia were treated with parenteral ampicillin and gentamicin as the first line of treatment. the mother/caregiver was advised to consult with the study physician over cell phone or return to the hospital at any time if any sign or symptoms of illness develop within the scheduled follow-up visit. nasopharyngeal wash samples were collected for respiratory viral testing by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. assistant stabilized the child\u2019s head against the mother\u2019s/caregiver\u2019s chest. then physician inserted the cannula 1.5\u20132 cm into the nostril parallel to the palate, flushed the saline into posterior nasopharynx, and immediately aspirated back into the syringe. 35% of severely malnourished children with pneumonia and 25% in severely malnourished children without pneumonia [27]. we entered data using SPSS for Windows version 20.0 and analyzed it using STATA version 13. to examine statistical significance between case and control patients, we used Chi-squared tests in baseline characteristics. the hospital of icddr,b provides care and treatment for approximately 140,000 patients annually mostly from low-socioeconomic urban or peri-urban communities in Dhaka. among 6,035 children 5 years with diarrhoea and other co-morbidities around 23% (1,408) were severely malnourished, 24% (1,453) children had pneumonia and 6% (354) had both SAM and pneumonia. children with severe malnutrition having cough or respiratory difficulty without any additional sign of pneumonia were evaluated for radiological pneumonia through chest X-ray. children with known congenital heart disease presented with features of pneumonia (cough, fast breathing, chest in-drawing and even cyanosis) secondary to congestive cardiac failure. children with severe malnutrition and pneumonia were treated with parenteral ampicillin and gentamicin as the first line of treatment. for those children who did not respond (no improvement within 48 hours or presented deterioration of clinical sign symptoms of pneumonia within 24 hours of initiation of antibiotics) antibiotics were changed to ceftriaxone and levofloxacin according to Dhaka Hospital protocol [23] study physician washed hands, wore gown, mask and gloves. drew up 4 mls of sterile bacteriostatic saline (0.9% NaCl) in a 5 ml syringe and attached the syringe with the bulb of the catheter. laboratory two aliquots were prepared from each sample. one was processed for testing and one stored in -80\u00b0C freezer. rRT-PCR was performed for detecting respiratory viruses using fluorescent Taqman probes. the monthly detection of viral pathogens was generated in a trend graph. we adjusted for age, PCV vaccination, duration from illness onset to hospitalization, and use of antibiotics prior to hospitalization. any association with a p value 0.05 was considered statistically significant. median age was 8 months (IQR: 5\u201313) and 11 months (IQR: 6\u201318) and 62% and 61% were male (p = 0.7), respectively. younger in age (8 months vs. 11 months, p = 0.001), lower Z score of weight for age (p = 0.01), congenital heart disease (p0.001), exposure to cigarette smoke at home (p = 0.04), and getting antibiotics before hospitalization (p0.001) were more common -value n (%) Male 224 62 203 61 0.696 Age in months,

etiology, at an urban hospital in Bangladesh. the most commonly detected single respiratory virus among controls was rhinovirus 24.8% (82), followed by adenovirus 7.9% (26), HMPV 1.5% (5), RSV 0.9% (3), HPIV3 0.9% (3), influenza A virus 0.3% (1), an influenza B virus 0.3% (1). eudomonas 25% (4), Enterococcus 12.5% (2), Salmonella typhi 12.5% (2), Streptococcus pneumoniae 6.3% (1), Staphylococcus aureus 6.3% (1), Klebsiella 6.3% (1), Streptococcus spp 6.3% (1), and Beta-hemolytic streptococcus 6.3% (1). antibiotic usage prior to admission was reported in 50% (8) of study children with bacteremia .9% (30) vs. 3.5% (6)], HPIV [5.1% (9) vs. 2.9% (5)], HMPV [2.2% (4) vs. 1.1% (2)] and multiple viruses [18.0% (32) vs. 4.6% (8)] were detected more frequently among younger children. compared to other respiratory viruses detected, tachypnea and chest in-drawing were higher in children with RSV. in no virus (10/109, 9.2%), influenza virus (1/16, 6.3%), rhinovirus (4/79, 5.1%), multiple viruses (3/63, 4.8%), adenovirus (1/24, 4.2%), no virus (4/109, 3.7%), rhinovirus (2/79, 2.5%) and there was no death in RSV. Respiratory Viral pathogens Odds Ratio (95% CI) Adjusted Odds Ratio (95% CI) P value Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) 12.5 (1.6\u201397.3) 13.1 (1.6\u2013106.1) 0.016 Adenovirus 1.1 (0.5\u20132.5) 1.4 (0.6\u20133.5) 0.424 Influenza virus 6.0 (0.7\u201350.7) 8.7 (1.0\u201378.9) 0.055 Rhino a recent study in Ecuadorian children also found an association between being underweight and increased odds of RSV[33]. in developed countries respiratory viruses were detected in up to 81% of young children with pneumonia, with RSV being the most frequently detected virus in most studies, ranging from 7% to 48%. rhinovirus was detected in 27% and 44% of children with pneumonia requiring hospitalization and 17% and 33% in asymptomatic control children. despite literature supporting the association of human rhinovirus with pneumonia, the continued shedding of human rhinovirus even two weeks after infection makes it challenging to infer a causal association between rhinovirus and pneumonia. different respiratory viral pathogens were detected more frequently in cases less than 1 year of age highlighting the importance of vaccination in younger age groups. in equatorian children RSV and HPIV were significantly higher among younger children. influenza virus was detected mostly during the influenza epidemic (May to September) in Bangladesh. no definite seasonal pattern was observed for other respiratory viruses. the development of an RSV vaccine is in progress. we did not subtype the predominant rhinoviruses and adenoviruses to identify the pathogenic subtype causing pneumonia. another limitation of our study was that we did not test for other respiratory viruses such as bocavirus, coronavirus, cytomegalovirus and enterovirus. information S1 Data File (SAV) Click here for additional data file.
