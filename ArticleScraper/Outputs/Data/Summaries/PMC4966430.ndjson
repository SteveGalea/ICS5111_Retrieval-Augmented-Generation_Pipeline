{"summary": "six experts in infectious and allergic disease were surveyed to allow for elicitation of group judgement and consensus view. key themes emerged where evidence shows interaction with microbes that inhabit the natural environment and human microbiome plays an essential role in immune regulation. the idea that there might be a link between the rise in allergic disease and reduced microbial exposure as a result of measures introduced to protect against infection was first proposed in 1989. this so-called hygiene hypothesis proposed that a lower incidence of infection in early childhood could be an explanation for the 20th century rise in atopic diseases. six experts in infectious and allergic disease were surveyed to allow for elicitation of group judgement. key themes emerged: first, the extent of the health burden of allergic and hygiene-related diseases and the evidence for a link to microbial exposure, the human microbiome and immune system. food, waterborne, and non-food-related infectious intestinal diseases (IIDs) remain at unacceptable levels. the true incidence in the community is 43% higher than in the mid-1990s. people with greater susceptibility to infectious disease make up an increasing proportion of the population, up to 20% or more. the largest proportion comprises the elderly who have reduced immunity, often exacerbated by other illnesses. norovirus, Campylobacter and Legionella were largely unknown as human pathogens before the 1970s. the rise of allergies in the 20th century has been regarded as a significant health burden. the marked increase in prevalence of allergic diseases, such as eczema,31 allergic rhinitis32 and food allergy, has been a prominent trend over the past century. epidemiological data indicate the situation is more complex. a compelling alternative is the interaction between genetic predisposition and environmental influences, particularly for food allergy. roasted peanut, as consumed in Europe and North America, is more allergenic than raw or other forms of processed peanut. studies show how OF exposures are vital because they interact with regulatory systems that keep the immune system in balance and prevent overreaction. diversity of microbial exposure is key because they interact with the regulatory systems that keep the immune system in balance and prevent overreaction. a 2008 review of epidemiological studies shows that Caesarean section is linked to increased risk of allergy. in high-income settings, there is likely to be a trans-generational effect where each generation receives a more impoverished microbiota. exposure obtained from outdoor environments is likely to be via the airways. the number of bacteria/archaea breathed in could vary between about 106 and 1010 in 24 h. studies show that exposure to bacterial components causes increased expression of a protein that inhibits inflammation. 86\u201388 introduction of antibiotics in the 1950s and subsequent prescribing trends show a reasonably consistent relationship between excessive antibiotic use, particularly in early childhood, and increased risk of allergic disease. antibiotics, particularly macrolides, have lasting effects on the microbiota of young children and increase risks of asthma. data from westernised homes suggest more diverse communities can be found on less-cleaned surfaces than regularly cleaned surfaces (cutting board, kitchen surface, toilet seat) there is no confirmed evidence of a link between personal or home cleanliness and increased risk of allergic disease. exposure has altered reflecting the reduced diversity of the human microbiota due to factors described above. if contact with the natural environment and microbial components of house dust occurs mostly via the airways, hygiene is unlikely to be responsible for reduced inputs from this key source. exposure to pets protects against allergies,58,59. domestic animals in the home have increased rather than decreased. microbial biodiversity in the air67 and the home is crucial. studies show that ciliary action brings about transfer to the gut. the likelihood that skin microbiota are OF microbes is indicated by studies showing that Acinetobacter species in skin protect against allergy. the critical question becomes what factors maintain optimum composition and biodiversity. loss of biodiversity is strongly associated with disease states, inflammation and decline. domestic and personal hygiene Of all the trends that might explain declining OF exposure, one of the weakest is the popular notion of \u2018being too clean in our own homes\u2019. if this factor contributes, its role is likely to be small relative to other factors. personal cleanliness (e.g. handwashing and showering) was associated with lower levels of endotoxin and muramic acid (bacterial markers) in bedding and floor dust. household cleanliness (e.g. cleaning floors and bathrooms, dusting, and changing towels) was associated with less dust but not with lower microbial marker levels. microbiome science to society \u2013 Prelude to Reversing Immunoallergic disorders. there is a window of time when the developing microbiome is critical for the education of the maturing immune system. preventive efforts against immuno-allergic disorders must be focused on early life events. science and society \u2013 communication barriers The stakeholders Challenge Media Preoccupation with sensationalism rather than truth Over-simplification and mis-portrayal of concepts such as hygiene, probiotics, and microbiota. if we are to maximise protection against infection, this is good news for hygiene. if we are to maximise protection against infection, we need a revised approach to hygiene based on current scientific evidence. studies record the presence of non-pathogenic bacteria and bacteria and viruses of medical interest on environmental surfaces in home and community settings. the critical control points for transmission of infection are the hands, hand contact surfaces, food contact surfaces, and cleaning utensils. improvements in hand hygiene alone resulted in reductions in gastrointestinal and respiratory illness of 31% and 21% respectively. e-bug project is a european-wide initiative aimed at ensuring all children leave school with an understanding of targeted hygiene. the multiple factors involved (allergen exposure, genetic, pollution, etc.) make it impossible to assess the contribution of each factor. success will only be achieved through combined effects of lifestyle changes, together with improved diet and reduced antibiotic prescribing. however, data are now strong enough to encourage changes, such as encouraging natural childbirth, more sport and other outdoor activities. campaigns targeting food or respiratory, pet or health-care hygiene are developed by different agencies. they do little to address public misunderstandings about how infections are transmitted, the difference between hygiene, cleanliness and dirt, and the widespread misuse of the term \u2018germs\u2019."}
