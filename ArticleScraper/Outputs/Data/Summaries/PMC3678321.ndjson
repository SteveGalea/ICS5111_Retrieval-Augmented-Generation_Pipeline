{"summary": "the importance of coupled ecological\u2013evolutionary interaction is often underappreciated owing to a general perception that ecological and evolutionary processes operate on vastly different time-scales. the discordance of time-scale leads to a perception that ecological and evolutionary processes can be treated independently. however, theoretical results consistently point towards the importance of ecological and evolutionary interactions even when rates are dissimilar. the structure of the phylogeny, and timing and frequency of bifurcations are correlated with transmission events and the effective number of infections (Ne) through the application of coalescent methods, such as skyline plots, the demographic history of a viral population can be reconstructed from the pathogen's phylogeny. as an infection expands, the virus' genome is passed from infected to susceptible hosts, analogous to offspring receiving a genome from their parents. the presence of LDT during an epidemic will produce recognizable patterns in the viral phylogeny. this follows from the exponential growth in the number of new foci of infection that emerge early in the epidemic. raccoon rabies is an excellent case study for exploring our hypothesis. the rabies virus genome consists of a single strand of RNA, eliminating the complicating effects of reassortment. we compare the phylogenetic structure of the rabies virus that emerges under different estimated rates of LDT [35] with the following research aims: first, we use simulated data based on reasonable parameter values to determine whether the presence of LDT can be reliably detected. second, we test whether evidence for LTD can be detected in empirical genetic data from a large raccoon rabies epidemic in the USA. the continuous ODE model is converted into a discrete stochastic model using Gillespie's method. the equations for our ODE model are 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 where i and j are a spatial indices. the total population size in location i is Ni. i, i local movement rate 6 106 day1 [34,47] LDT long-distance translocation rate 6 107 day1 [35] kij fraction of emigrants occurs at a per capita rate of Ii where is the transmission coefficient. the transmission coefficient must also be scaled to match the spatial resolution of the model. the length of this period is extremely short, on the order of 14 days. our model includes both local dispersal and LTD of raccoons. local dispersal is the movement of raccoons over the landscape. the total model area (840 000 km2) and the patch size (1600 km2) approximate the area affected by the mid-Atlantic raccoon rabies epidemic. patches within our landscape are connected by the local movement of raccoons between adjoining locales. the probability that an infection will occur at the next event time is SiIi/r. the individual probabilities are combined to create a probability mass function of events. the model dynamics are created by repeatedly computing the time to the next event, updating the model clock to the new time and choosing the type of the next event based on the probability mass function. it can be used to determine the chain of infectious antecedents that connect a particular individual to the index case or the infectious descendents that follow from a single infected individual. the third component of our model simulates the molecular evolution of the virus along the branches and nodes of the infection tree. the slope and correlation coefficient together reflect the strength of the correlation and the degree of IBD. the spatial spread of infection causes viral genotypes to occur in clusters that partition the landscape into patches. we performed an additional 12 runs in which we either increased or decreased by 10% the value of each of the six model parameters (a, b,,,,,,, ) we also considered an increased spatial domain for our model (50 30 cells) to explore the possibility that our results were scale-dependent or influenced by close proximity of the landscape boundaries. the continuous ODE model is converted into a discrete stochastic model. the equations for our model are 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4

period is extremely short, on the order of 14 days. local dispersal is the movement of raccoons over the landscape in search of food, mates and shelter. our model landscape is 600 1400 km divided into 525 (15 35) and 40 40 km patches. the total model area (840 000 km2) and the patch size (1600 km2) approximate the area affected by the mid-Atlantic raccoon rabies epidemic. the inverse, 1/r, is the expected time between events. the probability that an infection will occur at the next event time is SiIi/r. the individual probabilities are combined to create a probability mass function of events. the entire tree is a record of the spread of the virus between individual members of the population. it can be used to determine the chain of infectious antecedents that connect a particular individual to the index case or the infectious descendents that follow from a single individual. spatial analysis For each rate of LDT, we correlated the pairwise geographical and genetic distances to assess the magnitude of IBD. slope and correlation coefficient together reflect the strength of the correlation and the degree of IBD. the spatial spread of infection causes viral genotypes to occur in clusters that partition the landscape into patches. we performed an additional 12 runs in which we increased or decreased by 10 per cent the value of each of the six model parameters. we also considered an increased spatial domain for our model (50 30 cells) to explore the possibility that our results were scale-dependent or influenced by close proximity. exponential growth is a better fit in 80\u201394.7% of epidemics without LDT. exponential growth is a better fit in 80\u201394.7% of epidemics when LDT is included as a mode of host dispersal. the segmented regressions were fitted to the log-transformed effective number of infections (Ne) for LDT 0 we fit an exponential model to each of the 40 replicate skyline plots. for LDT 0 we fit an exponential model to each of the 40 replicate skyline plots (e.g. Ne = Cet), whereas for LDT = 0, we fitted a time-squared model (Ne = (vt + b)2). positive AIC values indicate a smaller AIC value for the time-squared and a better fit by the time-squared model of growth. negative AIC indicates a better fit by the exponential model of growth. the exponential growth model was the better fit in the presence of LDT. the positive relationship between the rate of LDT and the rate of exponential growth was nearly identical to the relationship obtained from the model without spatial heterogeneity. a linear regression of the rates of exponential growth from both sources indicates a strong linear relationship between the two. the demographic data was not as reliable a source as the skyline plots. for each replicate run, we computed the daily total number of infected hosts, Itotal, from the spatial dynamics. we then fitted models that assumed either time-squared or exponential growth during the period of spatial spread to the time-series of Itotal. growth in the effective number of infections (Ne) during the three phases of the mid-Atlantic raccoon rabies epidemic [34] in each panel the circles show the growth in Ne obtained from a Bayesian skyline plot analysis of 44 rabies sequences. the red line shows the fit of an exponential growth model and the blue line shows a time-squared model of growth. we find that the degree of IBD and the rate of LDT follow a power law. these results indicate that the strength of IBD will vanish as the rate of LDT increases. faster rates of LDT will tend to homogenize the landscape, causing all viral genotypes to become evenly distributed in space. differences in the topology and geographical pattern of pathogen phylogenies may result in a persisting \u2018signature\u2019 indicative of specific ecological processes. despite the considerable noise these processes are expected to add, we are able to reveal several differences in the phylogeny of the virus produced by LDT. the rate of rabies virus evolution is fast, but it is still not capable of tracking day-to-day changes in the size of an epidemic. we established the importance of LDT during the spread of raccoon rabies in Connecticut over a five-year period of expansion. genetic data is analysed with a model that makes explicit the contribution of different modes of dispersal and can be used to make predictions about spatial patterns of growth. our analysis based on skyline plots does not include spatial location information from our spatially explicit model. but our results suggest that phylogenetic patterns associated with spatial processes can be detected even when reliable spatial data are not available. the ability to detect the effects of LDT is limited if sampling was to occur immediately after the start of an epidemic. the skyline plots for different rates of LDT in figure 1a overlap and are indistinguishable in the period immediately following the epidemic. early in the epidemic there will have been few or no opportunities for events larger than a single county to occur."}
