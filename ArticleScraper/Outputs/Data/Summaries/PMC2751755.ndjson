{"summary": "Background Goose parvovirus (GPV) is a Dependovirus associated with latent infection and mortality in geese. it has been classified as a member of the genus Dependovirus in family Parvoviridae. it causes considerable economic losses, especially in countries with industrialized goose production system. quantitative quantitative real-time PCR (FQ-PCR) has been used widely to quantify the number of genomic copies of pathogenic microorganisms. in recent years, a method based on PCR with an automatic confirmation phase has been developed. the optimized 25-L FQ-PCR reaction system was as described by Huang et al. the optimized conventional PCR reaction system was as follows. 108 to 2.8 104 copies/L were used, as indicated on the x-axis. each dot represents the result of triplicate amplifications of each dilution. the correlation coefficient and slope value of the regression curve were calculated. the dynamic range of the established FQ-PCR method was between 2.8 1011 to 2.8 101 pVP3 plasmid copies/L with high precision. the dynamic range of the method was between 2.8 1011 to 2.8 101 pVP3 plasmid copies/L with high precision. the copy numbers of GPV in each tissue reached a peak at 48-72-h PI. numbers of GPV DNA decreased at 6 days, and by 9 days, the level of GPV DNA decreased remarkably. the control group did not show any positive results at any time point or in any tissue. 0.19 6.11 0.14 7.75 0.11 7.94 0.21 7.51 0.14 6.00 0.16 4.97 0.02 Kidney 6.98 0.08 7.86 0.11 8.27 0.07 9.15 0.16 9.94 0.14 10.87 0.05 9.34 0.19 7.56 0.16 BFC 7.57 0.09 8.25 0.16 8.42 0.14 9.07 0.07 9.85 0.14 10.95 0.14 9.68 0.18 8.84 0.05 Thymus 7.12 0.03 8.27 0.19 8.94 0.13 9.76 0.18 0.21 7.83 0.07 8.88 0.15 8.16 0.14 7.64 0.21 Ileum 0 7.76 0.18 7.90 0.18 8.18 0.23 8.78 0.14 9.45 0.21 8.61 0.23 7.87 0.15 Cecum 0 6.41 0.12 0.86 0.14 7.10 0.21 7.43 0.05 8.04 0.12 7.10 0.21 6.87 0.09 Rectum 0 6.17 0.16 0.33 0.12 0.19 7.28 0.12 7.95 0.19 7.45 0.16 6.67 0. the optimized conventional PCR reaction system used in this study was described by Huang et al. dilutions of pVP3 plasmid DNA were tested by the established FQ-PCR assay. the detection limit was found to be 2.8 101 copies/reaction. the established FQ-PCR is 1000-times more sensitive than the conventional PCR method. the results showed that the established FQ-PCR method was characterized by a wide dynamic range (11 logarithmic decades) of detection from 2.8 1011 to 2.8 101 pVP3 plasmid copies/L with high precision. therefore the dynamic range of the method was between 2.8 1011 to 2.8 101 pVP3 plasmid copies/L. the control group did not show any positive results at any time point or in any tissue (Table 1) Table 1. the distribution and quantity of GPVA at different time pointsB within the different segments of the tissue samples after the goslings were experimentally infected. 0.19 8.94 0.13 9.76 0.18 10.39 0.21 11.10 0.07 9.97 0.09 7.97 0.12 Esophagus 0 6.35 0.13 7.97 0.19 8.31 0.16 9.77 0.15 8.48 0.14 8.04 0.14 7.85 0.19 Trachea 0 6.24 0.05 7.61 0.19 8.03 0.05 8.95 0.19 8.11 0.07 6.21 0.21 Brain 0 6.62 0.07 7.88 0.05 8.18 0.23 8.27 0.09 HGD 7.07 0. real-time PCR assay was highly sensitive, specific, and reproducible. real-time PCR has become a potentially powerful alternative in microbiological diagnostics because of its remarkable sensitivity and high-throughput potential. GPV could be first detected at 2-d PI in the liver and other organs. the real-time PCR method was more sensitive than regular qualitative PCR methods. this finding is important because prevention and early detection are the most logical strategies for virus control. the animals were certificated as GPV-free by qualitative PCR assay. for standardization, the VP3 gene was cloned into a plasmid. the available live vaccine could have been used as standard. the fluorogenic probe was labeled at the 5' position with 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) dye as a reporter and at the 3' position with tetra-methylcarboxyrhodamine (TAMRA) as a quencher and with tetra-methylcarboxyrhodamine (TAMRA) as a quencher. the primer pair yielded a 441-bp amplicon. the product was ligated into the pGM-T vector (Tiangen Corp., Beijing, China) and transformed into E. coli DH5 competent cells. the pVP3 was extracted using the TIANprep plasmid extraction kit (Tiangen Corp., Beijing, China) the purity was confirmed using the 260/280 nm ratio. FQ-PCR reactions were optimized in triplicate based on primer, probe, and MgCl2 concentration selection criteria. conditions were selected to ensure both the fluorescence acquisition curves were robust and Ct values were the lowest possible to the known template DNA concentrations. an internal positive control was introduced into the FQ-PCR assay to verify that DNA was not lost during the extraction step. ids of pVP3 were serially diluted 10-fold from 2.8 106 copies/L to 2.8 100 copies/L using sterile ultra pure water. the detection limit of the conventional PCR was determined based on the highest dilution that resulted in the presence of clear amplified fragments (441 bp) on the agarose gel. a group of 40 goslings were randomly divided into 2 groups. a group of 40 goslings were orally infected with GPV CHV strain. another group of 10 goslings was treated with an equal volume of physiologic saline. the homogenizer was washed multiple times between each tissue homogenization. all the samples were analyzed 3 times. the viral concentrations were expressed as the mean log10 virus genome copy numbers per g or 1 mL of the tested tissue.

DNA from pVP3, GPV-CHv and several other pathogens were used as templates in the triplicate analyses to confirm the specificity of the technique. a group of 40 goslings were orally infected with GPV CHV strain. another group of 10 goslings was treated with an equal volume of physiologic saline. three goslings from the infected group and 1 from the control group were killed at each time point. the viral load was expressed as the mean log10 virus genome copy numbers per g or 1 mL of the tested tissue or blood.
