{"summary": "the deaths of four schoolchildren, during a pandemic influenza outbreak in December 2017 in Ghana, raised doubts about the ILI surveillance system\u2019s performance. we evaluated the ILI surveillance system to assess the system\u2019s attributes and its performance on set objectives. acute respiratory infection or flu-like syndrome are acute viral infections of the respiratory tract with similar signs and symptoms to influenza. the pathogen can be transmitted both directly (by droplets) and indirectly through contact with contaminated fomites. children, the elderly and pregnant women are at the highest risk for morbidity and mortality from ILIs. the national influenza center (NIC) was recognized by the WHO in 2010 after the 2009 pandemic influenza. it currently operates sentinel surveillance for influenza in 27 sites across all regions in Ghana. the system aims to detect early unusual events indicating a change in circulating influenza sub-types. the GAR is one of ten regional demarcations in Ghana with a population of about 5 million people. it lies in the southeastern part of the country along the coast of the gulf of Guinea. six of these facilities in the region conduct ILI surveillance. the evaluation was conducted using the CDCs guidelines for evaluating public health surveillance systems. nine attributes: simplicity, flexibility, data quality, acceptability, sensitivity, predictive value positive, representativeness, timeliness and stability, usefulness and the utility of the system to achieve its objectives were evaluated. six of these facilities in the region conduct ILI surveillance including four GHS facilities, one military and one quasi-government facility. they fall under the three main levels of healthcare delivery in Ghana; primary, secondary and tertiary. GARH and 37 Military hospital provide tertiary care. score of one (1) is given to each indicator that supports the attribute assessed. the assessment scores were then divided by the total number of indicators used in evaluating each attribute. scores were on a scale of 1 to 3: poorest to best performance. the expected annual total for each site is 260 suspected cases. clinicians at the OPDs suspect cases and trained personnel collect the specimen for storage in designated refrigerators. case detection is, in most cases, directly done by ILI surveillance team members at the OPDs. the ILI surveillance system met two out of its four objectives over the period evaluated. it was able to detect and characterize influenza viruses in circulation, as from influenza A and B lineages, and established the groups of persons most at risk of influenza infection. it did not set thresholds, which is the minimum number of suspected cases above which the system is alerted. no testing done at sites \u2022 Nasal or throat swabs \u2022 Confirmed cases followed up for 5 days 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 Flexibility \u2022 Modification of case definition at facility level \u2022 Use of case definition in detecting other health events \u2022 Frequency of interruption in system\u2019s operation \u2022 Number of unscheduled outages of system\u2019s computer \u2022 Funding source for ILI surveillance. the ILI system in GAR has been able to confirm influenza cases in each of the years evaluated. females were 60% (1775/2948) 1 1 3 Predictive value positive. five out of six sentinel sites detect influenza cases each year (83%) and about 80% of case investigation forms sampled were completely filled out by ILI personnel. most of the sites do not meet the case detection quota for each year with some recording as low as three suspected cases per year only. rRT-PCR is used to confirm real influenza cases from among those suspected using the influenza case definition and determine the influenza virus sub-type. each site is required to suspect five cases weekly using the case definition. the expected annual total for each site is 260 suspected cases. ILI data entry into DHIMS 2 started in 2017. Fig 2. Direction of information and data flow in the ILI sentinel surveillance system. influenza detection Of the 2948 suspected cases tested, 219 (7.4%) cases were tested positive for influenza viruses. the key findings on the indicators and scores for all the qualitative and quantitative attributes evaluated respectively. key findings, assessment scores, and overall scores (1 to 3), Greater Accra region, 2013\u20132017. assessment scores (0 = key finding does not support the attribute and 1 = key finding supports the attribute) and overall scores (1 to 3), Greater Accra region, 2013\u20132017. overall PVP for the period was 7.4% (range 4.7%\u2013 14.8%). only OPDs partake in ILI surveillance and follow-up of confirmed cases done within 5 days. specialized training is required for specimen collection and laboratory confirmation. constituted 60% (1775/2948) of cases. it takes on average 10 days between symptom onset and detection. majority of specimens are tested within 48 hours after collection. results are released within 7 days to the sites on average. isolated cases followed up for 5 days 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 Flexibility. symptoms added to those in IDSR case definition. the ILI system in GAR has been able to confirm influenza cases in each of the years evaluated. only OPDs partake in ILI surveillance and follow-up of confirmed cases done within 5 days. five out of six sentinel sites detect influenza cases each year (83%) and about 80% of case investigation forms sampled were completely filled out by ILI personnel. most of the sites do not meet the case detection quota for each year. most of the sites do not meet the case detection quota for each year. there was no time when no site recorded cases, but all sites detected cases only for 60% of the period. the disease is highly infectious with high pandemic potential. worldwide surveillance systems to record influenza-like illnesses are essential to prevent and control epidemics. similar findings were made in the south africa and Madagascar [14] influenza surveillance systems. lack of thresholds and antiviral resistance testing, of the system, are a major drawback. lack of thresholds and antiviral resistance testing, of the system require attention. human infection with zoonotic influenza strains is possible and may cause mild to severe form of the disease. there have been recorded episodes of pandemics in humans over a century due to cross-species transmission of zoonotic respiratory viruses. there have been recorded episodes of pandemics in humans over a century. failure of the system to address these shortfalls would also affect Ghana\u2019s contribution to the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System. one health approach is adopted with influenza surveillance in Ghana."}
