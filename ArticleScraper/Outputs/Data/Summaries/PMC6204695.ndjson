{"summary": "pathogens have adapted to detect specific host structures, polarity, and changes in local environmental stimuli. pathogens have adapted to detect specific host structures, polarity, and changes in local environmental stimuli (pH, temperature, oxygen, nutrients, hormones, physical forces, etc.) pathogens have adapted to detect specific host structures, polarity, and changes in local environmental stimuli. multidisciplinary teams of biologists, engineers, physicists, mathematicians, and clinicians are creatively working together to develop next-generation 3-D models with enhanced predictive capabilities. in vitro model advancement from 2-D to 3-D by incorporation of physiological factors to better mimic the in vivo environment. macrophages were present and either were empty (left inset) or contained internalized bacteria. iHIOs injected with E. coli O157:H7, nuclei (blue), neutrophils (CD11b; red), and nuclei (blue) are visible. cancer research community recognized that appropriate modeling of the 3-D microenvironment is important for mimicking disease. the discovery of biomechanical forces as environmental regulators of microbial pathogenesis was made by our team almost 2 decades ago. fluid shear forces globally reprogram Salmonella gene expression, stress responses, and virulence (35) MICROENVIRONMENTAL CUES IN HOST-MICROBE INTERACTIONS Mucosal tissue function and homeostasis are meticulously controlled by complex bidirectional interactions between cells and their microenvironment. microenvironment includes 3-D tissue architecture, multiple cell types, ECM, innate immunity mediators, indigenous microbiota, and physical forces. these factors are regulatory signals for mucosal pathogens and may be beneficial or detrimental for infection (1\u20135, 8, 35\u201345 epithelial cell polarity establishes barrier function, regulates uptake/transport of nutrients, and maintains epithelial architecture (65, 73\u201375). apical surfaces face the lumen and regions between villi/folds, lateral surfaces face adjacent cells, and basal surfaces face the basement membrane and lamina propria. intestinal microbiota contains prokaryotes, viruses, archaea, and eukaryotes. the intestinal microbiota is comprised of 1014 bacteria (>1,000 species), with Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes most abundant (90\u201393) mucins are complex mixtures of high-molecular-weight, glycosylated macromolecules that bind and remove pathogens and their products. mucins are complex mixtures of high-molecular-weight, glycosylated macromolecules that bind and remove pathogens. the ECM is a three-dimensional noncellular scaffold comprised of proteins (e.g., collagens, elastins, laminins, and fibronectins), proteoglycans, and water. the role of physical forces in cell and tissue development/function is as important as those of genes and biochemical signals. a dynamic signaling entity that regulates tissue function is now appreciated. tissue-specific architecture and function are regulated by the biophysical properties of the ECM (20, 115, 116), which exerts physical influences transduced by cell surface receptors through the cytoskeleton to the nucleus. these structural networks are critical for regulating cell shape/architecture. the intestine contains multiple epithelial cell types, including enterocytes (absorptive functions), enteroendocrine cells (antimicrobial production), goblet cells (mucin production), M cells (luminal antigen sampling/induction of mucosal immunity), Tuft cells (Th2 immunity), and cup cells (unknown function) the intestine also contains immune cells for innate and adaptive responses to pathogen attack. pathogens infect host cells differently depending on whether they are polarized or nonpolarized. maintaining barrier integrity requires proper expression and localization of tight and adherens junctions. some enteric viruses utilize receptors localized to these junctions. fecal microbiota transplants from healthy individuals to patients with recurrent, antibiotic-resistant Clostridioides difficile infections (98\u2013100) the importance of the gut microbiota to health is highlighted by successful clinical application of fecal microbiota transplants from healthy individuals to patients with recurrent, antibiotic-resistant Clostridioides difficile infections (98\u2013100). normal intestinal mucus consists of two layers: an outer layer colonized by microbes and a sterile inner layer (102\u2013104) the composition and thickness of these mucin layers vary throughout intestinal regions to accommodate their different functions and microbial burdens. the presence of sIgA and other mucin antimicrobials also serves to reduce bacterial colonization (105). the role of physical forces in cell and tissue development/function is as important as those of genes and biochemical signals (28, 109). physical forces regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and homeostasis (110, 111). forces experienced by intestinal cells include fluid shear, pressure (112), and contractile peristalsis of muscles (113). complex 3-D models can be developed and applied in parallel under different experimental conditions. pathogen-ECM interactions play an important role in mediating infection. a single epithelial cell type can spontaneously differentiate into multiple epithelial cell types normally found in the parental tissue. the RWV bioreactor is an optimized form of suspension culture that facilitates formation of self-organizing 3-D tissue-like aggregates. fluid shear influences cell proliferation, differentiation, morphology, and function. models developed within the dynamic RWV environment experience excellent mass transfer of nutrients/wastes. models exhibit enhanced in vivo-like characteristics, including spontaneous differentiation into multiple cell types that self-organize into 3-D structures. polarization, appropriate expression/localization of adherens/tight junctional complexes, blood-brain barrier (200), skin (201), eye (202), bone, joint, or disc (203\u2013207), and tonsil (208), among others. 3-D models into multiwell plates lends to their experimental tractability for infection assays. pathogens or compounds can be directly added to the RWV to study interactions under physiological fluid shear. one key advantage of RWV culture is the production of large numbers of cells. the presence of multiple cell types within a model enables study of their combined effects on infection. primary human lymphocytes have also been incorporated in a 3-D coculture model of intestinal epithelium to study Salmonella infection. the responses of these 3-D intestinal models to S. Typhimurium challenge were highly predictive of in vivo responses in humans/animals (11, 80, 152) these models were also the first in vitro systems to challenge the widely accepted paradigm established using monolayers that the Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 type 3 secretion system (T3SS) is required for invasion of intestinal epithelium (80, 152). intestinal mucosal barrier function against pathogen colonization through complex mechanisms not yet fully characterized. treatment of a 3-D intestinal model with lactobacillus reuteri reduced adhesion, invasion, and intracellular survival of this pathogen compared to findings for untreated cells. s. enterica pathovars with differing host tropisms and disease phenotypes. ST313 strains display genome degradation similar to that of human-adapted S. Typhi. strains are associated with devastating epidemics of blood-borne infections in sub-Saharan Africa. 3-D models exhibit an enhancement in nonlytic release of viral particles. this might result from morphological changes (e.g., enhanced brush border formation) in 3-D cells. another 3-D colonic model was used to study Cryptosporidium parvum. technique involves using two electrodes, one in contact with cells on a semipermeable membrane and the other in a different chamber containing culture medium. current models are not easily amenable to chronic infection due to lack of perfusion once removed from the RWV. a range of different organoid models have been established, including small and large intestine (229, 230, 232, 234, 240\u2013268), lung (269\u2013274), stomach (275\u2013282), breast (55, 283, 284), brain (285\u2013287), liver (222, 288, 289), pancreas (222, 290, 291), gallbladder (292), eye (293), kidney (294), prostate (222, 295, 29 biopsy specimens may be treated with a dissociation agent and/or mechanically disrupted prior to embedding into ECM. stem cells isolated from biopsy specimens can be predifferentiated into progenitor cells and further differentiated into ECM-embedded organoids. the NIH Intestinal Stem Cell Consortium defined a standardized nomenclature to reflect model sources, approaches, and in vitro structures (325). structures directly isolated include enterospheres, enteroids, and induced intestinal organoids (multicellular clusters from induced embryonal or pluripotent stem cells) transwell inserts are preferable over plastic, as the former display improved physiological relevance over conventional monolayers. key findings should be validated using intact organoids and microinjection to avoid artifacts. first infection using iHIOs was performed using human rotavirus. ettayebi et al. made a significant advance by the successful in vitro culture of human norovirus (HuNoV) the authors initially cultured 3-D intestinal organoids and then dissociated them into monolayers on plastic or Transwell inserts. successful viral replication was observed and only enterocytes were infected with HuNoVs. d-derived Transwell models identified MUC2 and protocadherin-24 as early EHEC infection targets (261) colonoids were initially cultured in 3-D, followed by dissociation onto Transwells. differentiation correlated with expression of differentiation markers, increased TEER, and microvilli (261). 3-D organoid models are advancing mechanistic understanding of host-microbe interactions due to their enhanced 3-D architecture and presence of Lgr5+ stem cells. patients can predict drug responses for cystic fibrosis treatment (222, 231, 250, 307, 329, 330) organoid-derived 3-D models developed using the RWV bioreactor (202) and organ-on-a-chip (OAC) (334) are further expanding these capabilities. TEER measurements are also not currently possible with intact organoid models due to their size and structure. chips are commonly made of a silicone polymer called polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), which is compatible with many cell types. chips contain several microchannels, membranes, and assorted cell types, thereby allowing the reconstruction of multiple tissue interfaces. the application of physical forces across several of these models alters physiological responses, including changes in expression/localization of tight junctions, barrier integrity/function, polarity and differentiation, cell viability, size, morphology, ECM production, integrin expression, enzyme activity, cytokine responses, chemical/gas exchange gradients, molecular transport, drug responses. model characterization revealed tight junctions, mucus production, and multiple intestinal epithelial cell types (absorptive, goblet, enteroendocrine, and Paneth cells) the ability of this model to support commensal colonization was assessed using Lactobacillus rhamnosus LGG. the presence of both PBMCs and LPS led to polarized secretion of basal proinflammatory cytokines. the formulation reduced EIEC-induced intestinal damage in the model lacking PBMCs but in the presence of immune cells only delayed injury onset. limitations and future directions of OAC models. the RWV bioreactor is an optimized form of suspension culture that facilitates formation of self-organizing 3-D tissue-like aggregates. fluid shear influences cell proliferation, differentiation, morphology, and function. models developed within dynamic RWV environment experience excellent mass transfer of nutrients/wastes. models exhibit enhanced in vivo-like characteristics, including spontaneous differentiation into multiple cell types that self-organize into 3-D structures. polarization, appropriate expression/localization of adherens/tight junctional complexes, blood-brain barrier, skin (201), eye (202), bone, joint, or disc (203\u2013207), and tonsil (208), among others. RWV-derived 3-D models of human intestinal mucosa. they have enabled the study of host-microbe interactions relevant to different regions of the intestinal tract, including the small intestine (11, 169) and colon (80, 143, 145, 146, 152, 171, 172, 175, 177) lamina components (e.g., collagen types II, III, and IV, laminin, vimentin, and fibronectin), brush border formation with villin, and/or mucus secretion (11, 80, 143, 145, 146, 152, 169, 171, 172, 175, 177) the presence of multiple cell types within a model (e.g., epithelial and immune cells) enables study of their combined effects on infection the responses of these 3-D intestinal models to S. Typhimurium challenge were highly predictive of in vivo responses in humans/animals. these models were also the first in vitro systems to challenge the widely accepted paradigm established using monolayers that the Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 type 3 secretion system (T3SS) is required for invasion of intestinal epithelium (80, 152). a 3-D intestinal model containing immune cells was used to profile responses to free secretory IgA (sIgA) and sIgA complexed with a commensal strain of E. coli (177). a 3-D intestinal coculture model containing immune cells was used to profile responses to both free secretory IgA (sIgA) and sIgA (sIgA) responses were downregulated relative to models treated with free sIgA the contribution of macrophages to Salmonella infection was assessed using S. enterica pathovars with differing host tropisms and disease phenotypes. the multidrug-resistant ST313 strains display genome degradation similar to that of human-adapted S. Typhi. 3-D models showed an enhanced number of viral particles secreted into the media at early stages of the viral life cycle. these data suggest that 3-D models exhibit an enhancement in nonlytic release of viral particles, which might result from morphological changes in 3-D cells. another 3-D colonic model was used to study Cryptosporidium parvum. bead porosity facilitates apical/basal cytokine secretion. there is currently an inability to sample the basal side. this also prevents measurement of transepithelial electrical resistance. this measures electrical resistance across a monolayer as a proxy for assessing barrier integrity (220) a range of different organoid models have been established, including small and large intestine (229, 230, 232, 234, 240\u2013268), lung (269\u2013274), stomach (275\u2013282), breast (55, 283, 284), brain (285\u2013287), liver (222, 288, 289), pancreas (222, 290, 291), gallbladder (292), eye (293), kidney (294), prostate (222, 295, 29 biopsy specimens may be treated with a dissociation agent. stem cells isolated from biopsy specimens can be predifferentiated into progenitor cells and further differentiated into ECM-embedded organoids. differentiation into committed cell types is enabled by stepwise supplementation and/or removal of signaling factors during culture. the NIH Intestinal Stem Cell Consortium defined a standardized nomenclature to reflect model sources, approaches, and in vitro structures (325). structures directly isolated include enterospheres, enteroids, and induced intestinal organoids (multicellular clusters from induced embryonal or pluripotent stem cells) transwell inserts are preferable over plastic, as the former display improved physiological relevance over conventional monolayers. a variety of pathogens have been studied using 3-D enteroid/colonoid/organoid models. d in iHIOs and were detected in epithelial and mesenchymal cells. d in iHIOs and were detected in epithelial and mesenchymal cells. crypt-derived enteroids also supported rotavirus replication. infection of colonoid-derived Transwell models identified MUC2 and protocadherin-24 as early EHEC infection targets. model differentiation correlated with expression of differentiation markers, increased TEER, and microvilli. gen isolate or purified TcdA led to a loss of barrier function. iHIOs injected with the nontoxigenic strain remained intact. 3-D organoid models are advancing mechanistic understanding of host-microbe interactions. organoid-derived 3-D models developed using the RWV bioreactor (202) and organ-on-a-chip (OAC) (334) are further expanding these capabilities. TEER measurements are not currently possible with intact organoid models due to their size and structure. chips are commonly made of a silicone polymer called polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), which is compatible with many cell types. PDMS has several advantages, including optical transparency for easy imaging, low cost, flexibility, and high gas permeability. vivo-like characteristics include spontaneous differentiation into multiple cell types, polarity/barrier function, formation of local 3-D structures. responses to biophysical forces, cytokine production, gene expression, mucus production, responses to nanoparticles and drugs, support of commensals, and/or susceptibility to microbial infections. the chip was engineered with dual vacuum chambers on either side of the microchamber to enable application of a physiological cyclic strain across the membrane to mimic intestinal peristalsis. this led to a highly polarized columnar epithelium and spontaneous formation of 3-D villus-like folds with basal proliferative cells in the crypt region. the presence of both PBMCs and LPS led to polarized secretion of basal proinflammatory cytokines. the formulation reduced EIEC-induced intestinal damage in the model lacking PBMCs but in the presence of immune cells only delayed injury onset. a consortium of researchers has developed 3-D intestinal models of increasing complexity that better mimic the biological, chemical, and physical microenvironments of the endogenous tissue. these models have ushered in a new era for infectious disease research by offering predictive in vitro translational platforms. the establishment of 3-D intestinal models and their application as human surrogates for infectious disease research has provided specific examples of how the study of microbial pathogenesis can be advanced. the alignment of multidisciplinary research teams dedicated to the establishment of 3-D models that reconstruct the architecture and function of the in vivo organ and their application for host-pathogen interaction studies make this an exciting time to be a scientist!"}
