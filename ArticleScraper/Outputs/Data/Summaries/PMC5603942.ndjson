{"summary": "inflammatory central nervous system disorders are one of the most common causes of neurological dysfunction in dogs and cats. the latter is commonly referred to as meningoencephalitis or meningoencephalomyelitis of unknown origin (MUO) (2,3) it is useful to consider disorders classed within MUO individually when possible. inclusion criteria included CSF pleocytosis, MR characteristics indicative of inflammatory lesions, and negative CSF reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) infectious diseases results. additional diagnostic investigations, including Toxoplasma gondii serology, were conducted in some cases. eosinophilic (> 50% neutrophils), mononuclear (> 80% mononuclear cells), or mixed (no predominance of any 1 cell type) RT-PCR analysis on all CSF samples was carried out in all cases for the following infectious agents. all cats received clindamycin (Antirobe; Zoetis, London, UK), 12.5 mg/kg BW, PO, q12h, while waiting for 5 to 7 d for CSF infectious disease PCR results. corticosteroid therapy was tapered by typically halving the dose or dosage every 2 to 3 wk unless a relapse was seen. selection criteria included CSF pleocytosis, MR characteristics indicative of inflammatory lesions, and negative CSF reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) infectious diseases results. further diagnostic investigations, including Toxoplasma gondii serology, were conducted and reviewed. nucleated cell population was classified as neutrophilic (> 50% neutrophils), mononuclear (> 80% mononuclear cells), eosinophilic (> 50% eosinophils), or mixed (no predominance of any 1 cell type) RT-PCR analysis on all CSF samples was carried out in all cases for the following infectious agents. all cats received clindamycin (Antirobe; Zoetis, London, UK), 12.5 mg/kg BW, PO, q12h, while waiting for 5 to 7 d for CSF infectious disease PCR results. corticosteroid therapy was tapered by typically halving the dose or dosage every 2 to 3 wk unless a relapse was seen. acute multifocal CNS 6 NP Mononuclear Dexamethasone then prednisolone + cytarabin. acute multifocal brain (forebrain and central vestibular system) 10 0.21 Mixed Dexamethasone then prednisolone, levetiracetam. 5 11 y FN DLH Obtunded mental status, non ambulatory right-sided hemiparesis, cervical hyperesthesia. chronic multifocal CNS 18 0.33 Lymphocytic Dexamethasone.

Pleocytosis was mixed in 5/16, lymphocytic in 5/16, mononuclear in 3/16, neutrophilic in 2/16, and eosinophilic in 1/16 cases. PCR results in CSF for T. gondii and feline coronavirus were available in 3/16 cases and were all negative. Ill-defined Yes Mild Hypo Hyper Meninges 5 Brain, cervical Intraparenchymal multifocal lesions and intramedullary lesion at C2 and C3 level. Ill-defined No No Iso Hyper Yes (cerebral) No (cervical) 6 Brain and T3-S3 spine Meningeal contrast enhancement. ancillary diagnostic investigations Complete blood (cell) count (CBC) and serum biochemistry were performed in all cases. results were not supportive of recent or active infection (high IgM titer) in any case. at first re-examination, 7/12 cats showed persistent mild neurological signs. mild pelvic limb ataxia, mild tetraparesis, intermittent spinal hyperesthesia, and reduced frequency (> 50% reduction) of partial seizures. localization was multifocal brain in 4 cases, forebrain in 4 cases, multifocal CNS in 3 cases, and multifocal spinal cord in 5 cases. PCR results in CSF for T. gondii and feline coronavirus were available in 3/16 cases and were all negative. Ill-defined No Iso Iso Yes T3-L3 spine Unremarkable. 2 Cervical Intramedullary lesion C6-T2. Ill-defined No Iso Hyper No 4 Brain Swollen cerebrum, decreased gray/white differentiation. intraparenchymal lesion in cerebrum, brainstem, and cerebellum. Ill-defined No No Iso Yes 14 T3-L3 Intraparenchymal lesions. cats, admitted for cluster seizure/status epilepticus, on admission received diazepam in combination with phenobarbitone (1 case) or levetiracetam (1 cat) to control seizures. all cats survived to discharge. follow-up was unavailable in 4 cases. clinical signs of FMUO correspond to the distribution of CNS lesions. onset of neurological signs was acute in most cases, similar to canine MUO (12,14), although the duration of signs may be underestimated in cats due to their temperament. type of pleocytosis did not correlate with duration of clinical signs. it is important to correlate it with characteristic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and negative infectious disease results. MRI findings are similar to those in canine MUO. acial involvement showed increased concentrations of antibodies against voltage-gated potassium channel complexes (VGKC-complexes) none of the cats herein showed similar clinical and MR findings; however, an underlying immune-mediated inflammatory etiology may result in shared biochemical features with FMUO. the dosages of these 2 drugs were based on previous descriptions of their use in feline patients (14,18\u201320) due to the lack of definitive histopathological diagnosis, it may be reasonable to consider infiltrative neoplasia as the main differential diagnosis for these patients. remission of clinical signs as secondary to use of chemotherapy in potentially misdiagnosed patients. cats with inflammatory lesions in the CNS should not always be associated with a poor outcome. inflammatory CSF in cats should not always be associated with a poor outcome. prognosis in dogs affected by MUO has been assessed in several studies. PCR results occurred or agents not tested for by CSF PCR were the cause of disease in this study. further studies of feline MUO are needed to determine prognosis and treatment response. MUO is an important differential diagnosis for variable neurological signs in cats."}
