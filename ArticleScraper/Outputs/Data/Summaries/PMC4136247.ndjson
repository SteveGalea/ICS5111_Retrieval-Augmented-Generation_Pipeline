{"summary": "inflammation during microbial infections, autoimmunity, or spinal cord injury is associated with recruitment of various B cell subsets. however, humoral responses persist during chronic CNS diseases such as subacute sclerosing panencephalitis and multiple sclerosis (6\u20138). factor of the tumor necrosis factor family (TNF) and a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) are also upregulated during virus- or autoantigen-induced CNS inflammation. there is no evidence for ectopic lymphoid follicles during Sindbis virus infection. infected mice exhibit impaired humoral responses in the CNS. naive/early-activated B cells migrate indiscriminately to sites of acute inflammation as bystanders but are replaced by more differentiated B cells derived from peripheral germinal centers. intracranial injection of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) does not elicit an increase in the number of infiltrating CD45hi cells by flow cytometry 5 days later compared to naive mice. titers within the brain and spinal cord were determined by a plaque assay using the murine delayed brain tumor astrocytoma (DBT) cell line. optimum densities were read at 450 nm on a SpectraMax Mz microplate reader. data are expressed as arbitrary units/mg tissue, where 1 arbitrary unit equals an absorbance of 0.1. background levels from naive mice were subtracted. mononuclear cells were recovered from a percoll step gradient. single-cell suspensions from cervical lymph nodes were prepared. cells were staining with MAbs specific for CD19 (MAb 1D3), CD45 (30-F11), CD138 (281-2), IgD (11-26), IgG2a/b (R2-40) cells were washed with RPMI supplemented with 25 mM HEPES. mononuclear cells were recovered from the 30%\u201370% interface of a Percoll gradient. a minimum of 1 105 cells were collected per pooled sample and frozen in 400 l TRIzol. quantitative real-time PCR was performed by using 40 ng of cDNA and SYBR green master mix. PCR conditions were 10 min at 95\u00b0C followed by 40 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 3 s, 60\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 30 s. gene transcripts in whole spinal cord or brain are expressed as the means standard errors of the means (SEM) of values obtained from at least 6 individual mice from 2 separate experiments, each comprising 3 to 4 mice per time point per experiment. a P value of 0.05 was considered significant, as determined by an unpaired t test. titers were calculated per mg tissue after 48 h of incubation at 37\u00b0C. Typical weights of brain and spinal cord were 397 10 mg and 80 2 mg respectively. blood-brain barrier permeability was assessed by using sodium fluorescein (NaF) to detect fluid-phase shifts between the circulation and CNS. mice received 100 l of 10% NaF in PBS intraperitoneally, and cardiac blood was collected 10 min later. cells were stained with biotin-labeled anti-IgG2a/b Ab and streptavidin. cells were then permeabilized with Cytofix/Cytoperm reagent (BD Bioscience), stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-IgG2a/b Ab. spinal cords digested with collagenase and purified by using a BD FACSAria instrument. derived B cells were compared to CD19+ IgD+ B cells isolated from pooled CLN of naive mice or infected mice at day 7 p.i. a minimum of 1 105 cells were collected per pooled sample and frozen in 400 l TRIzol (invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at 80\u00b0C for subsequent RNA extraction and PCR analysis. dehydrogenase (GAPDH), JHMV nucleocapsid, IL-6, IL-10, IL-21, APRIL, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL12, BAFF receptor (BAFF-R), B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) and transmembrane activator and calcium modulator and cyclophilin ligand interactor (TACI) were previously described. a P value of 0.05 was considered significant, as determined by an unpaired t test. RESULTS Preferential ASC accumulation in spinal cord correlate with viral persistence independent of total B cells. total CD19+ B cells and the CD138+ ASC subset were monitored throughout acute and persistent infection. a direct correlation between immunoglobulin mRNA and virus-specific Ab was assessed by measuring virus-specific IgG and IgM levels in brain and spinal cord supernatants. a direct correlation between immunoglobulin mRNA and virus-specific Ab was assessed by measuring virus-specific IgG and IgM levels in brain and spinal cord supernatants. data depict means SEM relative to GAPDH mRNA levels for at least 6 to 7 individual mice derived from two independent experiments. transcript levels at day 7 p.i. are expressed as means SEMs relative to GAPDH mRNA levels. infectious virus titers in spinal cord were higher than those in brain at day 7 p.i. and were controlled with delayed kinetics. increased viral load contributes to preferential accumulation of CD138+ ASC. astrocyte-derived CXCL10 drives accumulation of CD138+ ASC in the spinal cord. transcript levels were elevated at day 7 p.i. in both the brain and spinal cord relative to basal levels. transcript levels were 3-fold higher in infected spinal cord than in brain. similar differences were detected for the IFN-dependent expression of the CXCR3 ligand CXCL9. significant differences between brain and spinal cord at a given time point are indicated. expression of APRIL and BAFF, key cytokines that promote B cell survival, may enhance frequencies of CD138+ ASC in the spinal cord. basal levels of BAFF transcripts were already 4-fold higher in spinal cord than in brain. s for survival factors in the spinal cord relative to the brain are consistent with a more favorable niche for CD138+ ASC survival. the gradual loss of MHC class II supports in situ differentiation within the CNS or preferential survival of more differentiated ASC (10. cytokines IL-6, IL-10, and IL-21 are all expressed in the JHMV-infected CNS. ive and infected mice were assessed by real-time PCR. significant differences between naive and infected brain or naive and infected spinal cord are indicated. nodes are characterized by a downregulation of IgD and sustained IgM expression (40, 41) we monitored IgD expression on CNS-derived B cells over time. the frequencies of IgDlo IgM+ B cells increased to similar levels in both sites. early-activated B cells are replaced with isotype-switched Bmem in the CNS. representative plots of IgD and IgM expression levels on CLN- and brain-derived CD19+ CD138 B cells at days 7 and 28 p.i. the proportion of isotype-switched IgM Bmem in CD138 B cells (55%) approximated that of IgG2a/b surface-expressing cells (Fig. 4E) both surface IgG and intracellular IgG were detected in CD138 B cells and CD138+ ASC (2, 42\u201344) IgD and CD38 transcript levels were indeed the highest in naive CLN-derived IgD+ B cells and slightly lower at day 7 p.i. in spinal cord-derived IgD+ B cells, IgD transcript levels were 40-fold lower and CD38 transcripts were 4-fold lower than those in their CLN counterparts. AID transcripts were barely detectable in spinal cord-derived IgD+ B cells. they were undetectable in CD138 IgD Bmem and CD138+ ASC. these results support that B cells accumulating early in the CNS are derived from activated cells emigrating from the periphery. CXCR4 ligand CXCL12 regulates ASC homing to and retention in the bone marrow (60). basal CCL19 and CCL21 mRNA expression levels were significantly higher in brains. CXCL12 transcript levels were significantly higher in spinal cords. significant differences between brain and spinal cord at a given time point are indicated (*, P 0.05; **, P 0.005; **, P 0.005; ***, P 0.001) significant differences between brain and spinal cord at a given time point are indicated. levels were barely detectable in CD138+ ASC. CCR7 transcript levels were similar between CLN- and spinal cord-derived IgD+ B cells. levels were reduced by 50% in IgD CD138 Bmem. naive B cells express BAFF-R, while CD138+ ASC upregulate BCMA and TACI expressions. transcript levels for both BAFF-R and TACI were reduced in spinal cord-derived IgD+ B cells. the data are consistent with CD138+ ASC receiving TACI- and/or BCMA-dependent survival signals via APRIL engagement. the data are consistent with CD138+ ASC receiving TACI- and/or BCMA-dependent survival signals. B cells were present by as early as day 5 p.i. in brain but were barely detectable in spinal cord. CD138+ ASC did not emerge until after day 7 p.i., when their numbers increased to maximum levels at between 21 and 28 days p.i. IgG levels were significantly increased at both days 21 and 28 p.i. but were overall lower and most prominently increased in spinal cord at day 28 p.i. titers in brain or spinal cord supernatants were determined by a plaque assay. they are expressed as mean PFU per mg of tissue SEM. data are from two independent experiments with 5 to 10 total mice per time point. enhanced viral load contributes to preferential accumulation of CD138+ ASC in the spinal cord. increased viral load and persistence in the spinal cord relative to the brain may be associated with ongoing immune activation. differences in BBB integrity between brain and spinal cord were therefore measured by leakage of NaF administered into the circulation. enhanced CXCL10 expression in spinal cord relative to that in brain promotes infiltration of CD138+ ASC egressing from lymph nodes at days 14 and 21 p.i. the expression of APRIL and BAFF, key cytokines that promote B cell survival, may enhance frequencies of CD138+ ASC. at day 7 p.i., BAFF transcript levels were increased 4- and 2-fold in brain and spinal cord respectively. overall, BAFF mRNA in the brain remained below basal levels in the spinal cord. naive mice were similar in both sites and were significantly upregulated only in the spinal cord. IL-10 and IL-21 transcript levels were always significantly higher in spinal cord than in brain. expression levels were already 3-fold higher in spinal cord than in brain. IL-6 transcript levels peaked at day 7 p.i., suggesting limited contribution of IL-6 to ASC differentiation. at day 7 p.i., 90% of B cells in both the brain and spinal cord were IgD+ IgM+ (Fig. 4A and B) at day 7 p.i., 90% of B cells in both the brain and spinal cord were IgD+ IgM+ (Fig. 4A and B), consistent with a naive or early-activated phenotype. CD138 B cells also comprised an increasing population lacking both IgD and IgM. accumulation of Bmem was accelerated in spinal cord relative to brain by day 21 p.i. percentages of each B cell subset within total CD19+ CD138 B cells SEM represent two independent experiments. each using pooled brains or spinal cords from 6 to 8 mice per time point. naive/early-activated IgD+ IgM+ B cells are recruited to brain and spinal cord at similar frequencies early during acute JHMV infection. this transition is most prominent at between days 14 and 21 p.i.. this transition is most prominent at between days 14 and 21 p.i. a factor that regulates egress of activated lymphocytes from lymphoid tissue is S1P1 (51, 52), predicting that S1P1 transcript levels are lower in spinal cord- than in CLN-derived IgD+ B cells. AID transcripts were barely detectable in spinal cord-derived IgD+ B cells and undetectable in CD138 IgD Bmem and CD138+ ASC. transcript levels are relative to GAPDH levels. data from two independent experiments (EXP 1 and EXP 2) show the mean percent changes in transcript expression levels of each cell population. neither CCL21 nor CXCL12 transcript levels were altered. these data suggest that CXCL13 and CXCL12 upregulation may contribute to the recruitment of early-activated B cells from the periphery. however, effects of CXCL12 cannot be excluded. naive mature B cells express CXCR4, CXCR5, and CCR7. expression levels of CXCR3, CXCR4, and CCR7 transcripts were compared in IgD+ B cells, IgD CD138 Bmem, and CD138+ ASC. 3 transcript levels were low in both CLN- and spinal cord-derived IgD+ B cells and highest in spinal cord-derived CD138+ ASC. CXCR3-mediated migration of ASC to the CNS (20, 66), while CCL19/CCL21/CCR7 and/or CXCL12/CXCR4 interactions promote the accumulation of early-activated IgD+ B cells. 138+ ASC upregulate BCMA and TACI expressions. transcript levels were higher in CLN-derived IgD+ B cells. levels in all three spinal cord-derived populations were 80% lower. naive CNS is largely devoid of B cells, but heterogeneous B cell subsets accumulate in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during acute and chronic CNS infections (1, 72), but there is little information on the forces driving CNS B cell lineage accumulation. oligoclonal IgG in the CSF during chronic infection as well as MS is consistent with local ASC enrichment. early recruitment of IgD+ IgM+ B cells was also noted for Sindbis virus infection (2). the data for both models are consistent with a gradual replacement of early IgD+ B cells in the CNS with more differentiated B cells at the time of peripheral germinal center reactions. the chemokines recruiting IgD+ B cells to the CNS are unknown. the ligands CCL19 and CCL21 are supported as candidates based on the sustained expression of CCR7 and CXCR4 transcripts by IgD+ B cells. the elevated CXCR3 transcript levels in CNS-derived Bmem relative to early-activated IgD+ B cells imply that Bmem may respond to CXCR3-mediated signaling. the progressive accumulation of more differentiated B cell phenotypes is thus more likely driven by the preferential survival of ASC and Bmem over IgD+ B cells. the gradual downregulation of MHC class II on ASC supports their ongoing focal differentiation (10)"}
