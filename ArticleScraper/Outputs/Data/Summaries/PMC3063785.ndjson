{"summary": "influenza is the most important respiratory disease in terms of mortality and morbidity. between 3 and 5 million severe cases and 250,000 to 500,000 deaths due to seasonal influenza are reported worldwide. vaccines for novel influenza virus strains require approximately 6 months to develop and produce [5] antivirals remain the first line of defense. strains carrying the H275Y mutation were not thought to be a great concern for public health [10], [18], [19]\u2013[21]. During the 2007\u20132008 influenza season, however, the A/Brisbane/59/2007-like (H1N1) H275Y mutant emerged and rapidly disseminated worldwide in the apparent absence of antiviral pressure [18], [19]\u2013[21]. a study showed that its fitness was similar to that of its wild-type (W contemporary oseltamivir-resistant strains have shown a decrease in that affinity, but remain above the level of older strains [25]. the eventual dominance of the H275Y mutant may be due to a better balance between the hemagglutinin (HA) and NA activity. a longer latent infection period for cells infected by the H275Y mutant is compensated for by a shorter infecting time required for that cell, once releasing virions, to successfully infect other cells. linear fits to the first three time points are shown for the WT (solid line) and H275Y mutant (open circles) points indicate the average plaque radius over all plaques at a given time with SEM errorbars. the unit of length used here, is the average diameter of an ST6GalI-MDCK cell. the measured plaque growth was more rapid for the WT than the H275Y mutant. using plaque velocity alone, it would appear that the WT strain has a replicative fitness advantage over the H275Y mutant. multiple-cycle viral yield experiments can be broken into two different phases. the plaque growth experiment yields a single experimental measure for each strain: the plaque velocity. the multiple-cycle viral yield assay provides two quantities: the viral titer growth rate, and the viral titer decay rate. to this aim, we have constructed mathematical models which allow us to simulate each in vitro assay in a computer experiment. one parameter can be determined immediately from the multiple-cycle viral yield results. the viral titer decay rate corresponds to the slowest of the rate of loss of virus-producing cells and the rate of viral infectivity loss [37]. the infection rate per virus, and the viral production rate, can be combined into a single parameter, leaving only three parameters to be determined. the only identifiable quantity is the product of the two rates, which correspond to the average time it takes a single virus-producing cell to cause the latent infection of one more. base values for each parameter were used: infectious lifespan, [40], [64]\u2013[66]; infecting time, [34], [35]; latent infection period, [40], [67]\u2013[69]. a shorter infectious lifespan will lead to the earlier appearance of plaques, resulting in larger plaque sizes at any given time. time, and the latent infection period, to be determined from our two experimental measures, the plaque velocity and viral titer growth rate. the experimental measurement of either quantity alone is not sufficient to specify the values of these infection parameters for a given strain. the measurement of both, however, can provide enough information for this specification. the region of intersection suggests that the latent infection period for the H275Y mutant ( h) is longer than that of the WT strain (1\u20133 h), while the infecting time of the mutant ( 5 min) is much shorter than that of the WT (30\u201380 min). a Errors denoted by a range of values are 95% confidence intervals. s 6C and 6F for the parallel plaque and yield experiment. from fits to 1000 bootstrap replicates for the single-cycle yield experiment. a value not calculated in Figure 6F. data sets from two replicates of two independent experiments show reproducibility of the results. each data point represents a single titration of the supernatant of a single well. growth of the H275Y mutant virus titer is delayed by 2\u20133 h with respect to the WT. the H275Y mutant strain had poorer NA activity compared to the WT. we directly measured the enzymatic activity of the NA of each virus strain using the fluorescent substrate 4-MUNANA. this provides information independent of virus-cell infection dynamics. plaque growth is characterized by an initial delay where no growth is observed. after 60 h, the rate of plaque growth declines and the linear approximation is no longer valid. the growth attenuation could be due to a number of factors including a hardening of the overlay, a depletion of nutrients required for viral production and cell maintenance. relying on single time point measurements for comparing strains can be misleading. this allows us to extract a novel measure, the plaque velocity, which is the slope in the linear regression of the plaque growth to the 36, 48 and 60 h time points. s of the viral yield experiments can be broken into two different phases. an exponential growth of virus concentration followed by an exponential decay of virus concentration, characterized by the viral titer decay rate, after the viral titer peak. the decay rate was the same for both strains at. plaque growth is characterized by an initial delay where no growth is observed. after 60 h, the rate of plaque growth declines and the linear approximation is no longer valid. the growth attenuation could be due to a number of factors including a hardening of the overlay, a depletion of nutrients required for viral production and cell maintenance. the plaques observed at 48 h for strain A are larger than those for strain B. but at 60 h, the WT strain has significantly larger plaques than the H275Y mutant. this allows us to extract a novel measure, the plaque velocity, which is the slope in the linear regression of the plaque radius to the 36, 48 and 60 h time points. the viral titer decay rate was the same for both strains at. Figure 3. Multiple-cycle viral yield experiment. the decay rate, which is assumed to be the rate of viral infectivity loss, was found to be for both strains. a cell can be in one of four states \u2014 target (uninfected), latently infected (infected but not yet releasing virus), infectious (releasing virus) and dead (no longer releasing virus), and its passage through these states is determined by five infection kinetics parameters. the viral titer decay rate corresponds to the slowest of the rate of loss of virus-producing cells and the rate of viral infectivity loss. the decay rate was determined to be for both A/Brisbane/59/2007 strains. this corresponds to a virion half life of approximately 3.6 h. to determine how each of these parameters affect the infection dynamics, we varied each individually about a base value and measured the effect on the simulated experimental quantities. a shorter infectious lifespan will lead to the earlier appearance of plaques. the infectious lifespan of a cell appears only as a time-delay between the infected cell plaque growth and the dead cell plaque growth. this indicates that plaque velocity is established at the advancing edge of an infection wave, and is likely unaffected by cell death in the wake of that wave. figures 6A and 6D show the values of the kinetics parameters most consistent with the measured plaque velocities of the A/Brisbane/59/2007 WT and H275Y mutant strains. the region of intersection corresponds to those parameter values most consistent with the parallel plaque and viral yield experimental measurements for a particular strain. the infecting time of the mutant (5 min) is much shorter than that of the WT (30\u201380 min). the infecting time of the mutant (50 1.0) is much shorter than that of the mutant (h) the viral titer of each strain was observed to grow rapidly after 4 h post-infection. the viral titer of each strain was observed to grow rapidly after 4 h post-infection. the growth of the H275Y mutant virus titer is delayed by 2\u20133 h. peak virus was equal to one and then performed a least-squares fit to the full set of normalized data for each virus strain. the fitted value of the average latent infection period was found to be 5.6 h for the WT strain and 7.5 h for the H275Y mutant. this would explain the shorter infecting time for the mutant strain in that its virions would more easily bind to new cells with less interference from its NA activity. the infectivity of the mutant strain was found to be much longer than the WT. independent single-cycle viral yield assay results lend support to the hypothesis of a longer latent infection period. neuraminidase is the viral surface enzyme responsible for cleaving the virus from its sialic-acid receptors at the cell surface [47] it can be expected that an increase of its expression would lead to more rapid viral release (a shorter latent infection period for the WT strain) but may also hinder the subsequent attachment of virions to other cells, leading to decreased infectivity (longer infecting times) the experimental quantities themselves are robust and easily measurable in repeated experiments. the viral plaque is formed by the progression of an infection wave across the monolayer of cells whose constant velocity is determined by the infection kinetics averaged over many thousands of cells. the results we present here are preliminary, a proof of concept for the method which requires further verification and refinement. it would be useful to develop an experimental assay which could measure the infecting time for a given strain. it is also of interest to design a set of experiments which may be less expensive and laborious than those presented here. plaque assays were prepared using a semi-solid overlay of 1.2% Avicel RC-581. cells were grown to confluence, achieving an average diameter of (used herein as a unit of length), achieving an average diameter of (used herein as a unit of length,. supernatants were harvested every two hours for 24 h or every hour for 14 h. samples were frozen at C until titrated in duplicate by plaque assay. GraphPad Prism 5.01 software was simulated using a one-dimensional, time-delayed, partial differential equation (PDE) model: (1) where and are the densities of target and infectious cells, respectively, and is the virus concentration. the model parameters are: the diffusion coefficient for virus particles, ; the production rate of virus, in ; the latent infection period of a cell (the time from infection to virus release) a transcendental equation can be solved numerically for the viral titer growth rate. both the plaque velocity and viral titer growth rate depend on the infection and production rates only through. the equations can be integrated to show that is the time for that single infectious cell to cause the (latent) infection of one more cell. a function on the parameter space,, for the viral titer growth rate is constructed analogously. in the single-cycle viral yield data, a more biologically-realistic model was used. in this model, target cell and virus dynamics are identical to that of Equation (2). cells were grown to confluence, achieving an average diameter of (used herein as a unit of length,) prior to infection, cells were grown to confluence, achieving an average diameter of (used herein as a unit of length,. supernatants were harvested every two hours for 24 h or every hour for 14 h. samples were frozen at C until titrated in duplicate by plaque assay. GraphPad software, la Jolla, CA, has built-in 'Enzyme Kinetics' features. the model parameters are: the diffusion coefficient for virus particles, the production rate of virus, in. the rate of viral infectivity loss was fixed at (20-fold smaller than Stokes-Einstein value for a 100 nm particle in C water. exponential growth rate of viral titer in the multiple-cycle yield assay can be derived from this system by assuming that in the early phases of an infection: the number of target cells is approximately constant. there is an exponential growth of infectious cells and virus with common rate. infectious cell death can be neglected. a function on the parameter space,, for the viral titer growth rate is constructed analogously. in fitting the single-cycle viral yield data, a more biologically-realistic model was used. in this model, target cell and virus dynamics are identical to that of Equation (2)."}
