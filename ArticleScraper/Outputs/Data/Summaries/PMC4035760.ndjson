{"summary": "new models can reliably estimate the death rate of productively infected cells from acute-phase data. the new models are called the reduced quasi-steady state (RQS) model and the piece-wise regression (PWR) model. the new models provide much better estimates than the previous model. in most viral infections, the initial exponential growth phase is followed by a second exponential phase known as contraction. contraction slows down so that the viral load approaches a steady state, called the virological set point. this simple approach is reasonable as long as conditions, e.g., the availability of target cells or the immune response, hardly change within each phase. the death rate per se is useful for evaluating the efficacy of vaccine-induced cellular immune responses during the acute phase of virus infection [14-16]. in this study, we first generated simulated datasets with biologically plausible parameter values. the time evolution of target cell densities and viral load were modeled during the acute phase. V't = pI t - cV t, (2) V't = pI t - cV t, (3) where the parameters, p and c represent the conventional rate constants for viral infection of target cells, the death rate of infected cells, and the clearance rate of virus particles. this model can be simplified further by a quasi-steady state (QSS) approximation for the viral particles [7,21-23] r = p/c is the viral replication rate per target cell, and is the death rate of infected cells. the reduced standard model of Eqs. (1\u20133) lumps the 8 parameters into five parameters, i.e., r,,, T(0), and V(0). the variables T(t), I(t) and V(t) denote the number of target and infected cells per ml and the amount of viruses per ml, respectively, at time t. the parameter denotes the loss rate of target cells per day after the flat phase, the rate constant for viral infection of target cells, and c the clearance rate of virus particles. the PWT model is completely depleted, i.e., T() 0, in the PWT model. we can generalize the depletion of target cells to mechanisms other than infection only, and have a model with very similar parameters characterizing the acute viral infection. we also consider a classical method widely adopted in earlier literatures [3,5-7] artificial data generated from a population dynamics model of virus infection. we created simulated time course data of target cell densities and viral load during the acute phase of viral infection. the datasets were subsequently analyzed by the two novel RQS and PWT models. the number of human leukocytes in 10 l of peripheral blood (PB) was measured in a celltac MEK-6450 hematology analyzer. the percentage of memory CD4+ T cells in human CD45+ leukocytes (i.e., CD45+ CD3+ CD4+ CD45RA- cells) was quantified in a flow cytometer. the initial expansion of viral load in this model is well approximated by V(t) V(0) exp (g0t) [3,5-7], with an exponential growth rate, g0 (the Malthusian parameter), given by the positive root of the characteristic equation g02 + (c + )g0 + c - pT(0) = 0, i.e., g 0 = - c + + c - 2 + 4 p T 0 / 2. reduced quasi-steady state (RQS) model lumps the 8 parameters of reduced standard model of Eqs. (1\u20133) into five parameters, i.e., r,,, T(0), and V(0). because there is no production of target cells the infection will be cleared. the variables T(t), I(t) and V(t) denote the number of target cells per ml and the amount of viruses per ml, respectively, at time t. the parameter denotes the loss rate of target cells per day after the flat phase, the rate constant for viral infection of target cells, and c the clearance rate of virus particles. t* represents the time at which the target cells start declining with slope \u2013. t t *, (7) V t = V t * exp rT 0 1 - exp - t - t * - t - t *, for t > t *, (8) where the replication phase (Eq. (7)) is identical to the initial phase of the standard model (see the remark above) we can generalize the depletion of target cells to mechanisms other than infection only. standard model for viral infection consists of three differential equations for target cells, T(t), infected cells, I(t), and viral particles, V(t) [7-9] since during acute infection the normal production and loss of target cells is much smaller than the loss due to viral infection and/or its side effects. c is typically much larger than the death rate of the infected cells, we can make a QSS assumption, V\u2032(t) = 0, and replace Eq. (3) by V(t) = pI(t)/c. r = p/c is the viral replication rate per target cell, and is the death rate of infected cells. we propose a phenomenological model for the target cells consisting of an initial flat phase, and a second phase of exponential loss. the variables T(t), I(t) and V(t) denote the number of target cells per day after the flat phase, the rate constant for viral infection of target cells, and the amount of viruses per ml, respectively, at time t. the RQS model has the same definitions for the replication rate, r = p/c, the Malthusian parameter, g0 = rT(0) -, and the reproduction number R0 = rT(0). the target cells will ultimately be completely depleted, i.e., T() 0, in the PWT model. g0 = rT(0) - and R0 = rT(0). the viral replication rate per target cell can be estimated from the R0, i.e., r = R0/T(0). the down-slope will only reflect the death rate of infected cells. five humanized mice were infected with the CCR5-tropic HIV-1 (strain AD8) [29], and 100 l of peripheral blood (PB) was routinely collected under anesthesia through the retro-orbital venous plexus. the amount of viral RNA in 50 l of plasma was quantified by RT-PCR. the data was generated for one ml of PB with \u201ctypical\u201d values of the parameters for HIV-1, i.e., an infection rate = 10-8per cell per day, a virus production rate p = 4000 particles per day, and a clearance rate of c = 23 per day [7-11]. we study whether our simplified models can describe the in silico data, and whether their (lumped) parameters are identifiable. target cell densities are partially depleted in the RQS model. the novel RQS model (Eqs. (1) and (4)), the novel PWT model (Eqs. (5\u20138) and the previous PWR model were fitted to a total of 5 + 5 = 10 data points generated from the numerical solution. the standard deviations were set as = 10 - 9, = 0.3, p = 400. in this way, we obtained a distribution of the basic reproduction number centered around the true value (R0 = 2.48) we then randomly sampled one parameter set of, p from the distributions, and produced 200 different artificial datasets. the models differ around the peak because the previous PWR model assumes an exponential contraction after the peak, whereas the new models allow the peak be formed by the loss of target cells. however, if target cells were depleted rapidly such that there would be hardly any infection of target cells during the contraction phase, this difference would vanish. the parameters are those used in Figure 2; only the infection rate was altered to adjust the target cell depletion. when the other parameters were altered, similar results were obtained. the blue, green and orange symbols plot the indices estimated by the RQS, PWT and PWR models. all models perform similarly on estimating the exponential growth rate (Figure 3D) because they all assume that the number of target cells remains constant during the earliest phases of viral infections. the novel models were fitted to the 21-day time courses of viral loads and target cells observed in five virus-infected humanized mice. the novel RQS model ID T (0) V (0) g 0 r R 0 cells/ml RNA copies/ml day -1 (cell/ml) -1 day -1 (10 -6 ) day -1 (virion /ml) -1 day -1 (10 -6 ) day -1 --- 1 274139 2461 0.467 4.46 0.10 0.76 1.62 2 489096 652.1 1.065 3.37 0.03 0.58 2.83 3 9 the number of memory CD4+ T cells per ml of PB and the viral RNA load per ml of plasma are plotted as functions of time. the symbols denote experimental time course data and the dashed lines display the best fit of the RQS (Panel (A) and PWT (Panel (B) models to the data from each individual mouse. the log transformed data was fitted to the numerical solutions of the RQS model (Eqs. (1) and (4)), the analytical solution of the PWT model (Eqs. (5\u20138) and to the previous PWR model. the sum of squared residuals was minimized using the FindMinimum package of Mathematica 9.0, fitting the target cell and viral load data simultaneously. the true parameters were: = 10\u20138, p = 4000, = 0.7, c = 23 and the initial values were T(0) = 1000000, I(0) = 0, and V(0) = 1000, corresponding an R0 = 2.48 and 90% target cell depletion. we then randomly sampled one parameter set of, p from the distributions, and produced 200 different artificial datasets. the novel RQS and PWT models can more accurately extract information from acute-phase viral infection data. the novel models can more accurately extract information from acute-phase viral infection data. using the same equation, Petravic et al.[16] show that this final size of the target cell level provides a good description of the nadir, T min, of the target cell density during an acute infection. we use the final size equation to compute different values of the infection rate to vary the nadir of the target cells over the interval f [0.001, 0.200]. Using the same approach as explained above we fit the \u201cdata\u201d generated by these cases with the 3 models. the RQS model provides better parameter estimates than the PWT model. the parameters are accurately estimated by all methods when target cells are severely depleted. this occurs in simian\u2013human immunodeficiency virus infections (which deplete nave and memory CD4 T cells during the acute phase) we estimate a death rate of HIV-1 infected cells in humanized mice as ranging from 0.30 to 0.76. this result is in concordance with estimates of viral death rate in treated HIV-1 infected patients. experiments by the novel PWT model ID T (0) V (0) g 0 r t * R 0 cells/ml RNA copies/ml day -1 (cell/ml) day -1 (10 -6 ) day -1 day -1 --- 1 282809 2325 0.48 3.91 8.7 0.07 0.62 1.77 2 308636 589.7 1.06 5.86 5.8 0.13 0.75 2.42 3 79882.2 693.9 0.87 15.7 the novel models use the observed target cell densities when estimating the parameter values. using simulated data we have demonstrated that the new models typically outperform the previous model. using simulated data we have demonstrated that the new models typically outperform the previous model. the target cells of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), or CCR5-tropic SHIV infection (memory CD4 T cells expressing CCR5) have been measured from gastrointestinal mucosa samples [14,16,26-28]. Interestingly the rates at which the virus expands and at which infected cells die are similar to those in humans. authors declare that they have no competing interests. science Foundation, Sumitomo Foundation Research Grant to K.S., Senshin Medical Research Foundation, JST PRESTO program to S.I. the Aihara Innovative Mathematical Modeling Project."}
