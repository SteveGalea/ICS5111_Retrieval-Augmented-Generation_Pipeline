{"summary": "patients were prospectively monitored for diarrhea, oxygen desaturation, mechanical ventilation. hepatic dysfunction was defined as a mean level of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), or both, greater than the upper limit of normal. as proteinuria (>30 mg/dL), microscopic hematuria (>10 erythrocytes/L), pyuria (>50 leukocytes/L) on a dipstick test. RT-qPCR was performed for patients who had NPA, serum, stool, and urine specimens collected on days 10 to 15 after the onset of symptom onset. a 10% stool suspension was made by swirling approximately 1 g of stool in 10 mL of viral transport medium. serum from clotted blood was collected and stored at 4\u00b0C for antibody testing and at \u201320\u00b0C before RNA extraction. extracted RNA was finally eluted in 30 L of RNase-free water and stored at \u201320\u00b0C. the sequence of the reporter probe was 5 -(FAM)TCTGCGTAGGCAATCC(NFQ)-3 (FAM, 6-carboxyfluorescein; NFQ, nonfluorescent quencher; complementary to nt 17,745\u201317,760). a housekeeping gene, -actin, was detected by real-time RT-PCR with two primers. one hundred and fifty patients (97.4%) were ethnic Chinese, and 4 (2.6%) were Filipino. all patients had laboratory-confirmed SARS, either virologically by qualitative RT-PCR in 116 (75.3%) patients. six patients who died before day 28 did not have serologic documentation. microscopic hematuria in 20.1%, proteinuria in 3.8%. none of the patients had impaired renal function from admission to day 20. only four patients were found to have abnormal mean ALP levels. more patients with lymphopenia on admission had virus detectable by RT-qPCR in NPA (p = 0.04, odds ratio [OR] 2.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.7\u20134.4, data not shown) both the positivity rate and the viral load in NPA were significantly correlated with diarrhea, oxygen desaturation, mechanical ventilation, hepatic dysfunction, and death rate. a high viral load in serum was also associated with oxygen desaturation, mechanical ventilation, hepatic n = 142) 2.4 (3.1) 5.8 (1.6) 60/142 (42.3) Serum (n = 53) 1.1 (1.4) 2.7 (0.6) 22/53 (41.5) Stool (n = 94) 6.1 (3.0) 7.0 (2.1) 82/94 (87.2) Urine (n = 111) 1.3 (2.1) 4.4 (1.3) 32/111 (28.8) aSARS-CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2013associated coronavirus; 13 18 7 24 0 31 0 31 Median viral load (log10 copies/mL) 0 0 0.5 2.3 0 0.01 2.6 0 0.01 2.6 0 0.01 2.6 0 0.01 2.6 0 0.01 Stool (n = 94) RT-qPCR (+) (n = 82) 46 36 0.01; 14.1 (1.7\u2013114.0) 39 43 0.5 16 66 1 17 65 0.5 RT-qPCR (\u2013) ( RT-qPCR (n = 60) 56 4 0.8 40 20 0.01; 2.5 (1.2-5.2) 43 17 0.07 RT-qPCR (\u2013) (n = 82) 70 12 38 44 52 30 Median viral load (log10 copies/mL) 0 0 0.3 2.7 0 0.01 0 0 0 0.1 Serum (n = 53) RT-qPCR (+) (20 2 0.7 12 10 1 18 4 1 RT-qPCR (n = Specimen Diarrhea O2 desaturation Mechanical ventilation Death Y N p value; OR (CI) Y N p value; OR (CI) Y N p value; OR (CI) Y N p value; OR (CI) NPA (n = 40) RT-qPCR (+) (n = 18) 11 7 0.4 11 7 0.02; 5.3 (1.4\u201321.1) 7 11 0.01; 1.8 (1.2\u20132.7) RT-q correlation of RT-qPCR clinical specimens taken during days 10 to 15 and laboratory values in 40 patients with SARS who had specimens taken from all four anatomic sitesa. specimen Lymphopenia Hepatic dysfunction Abnormal urinalysis results Y N p value Y N p value NPA (n = 40) RT-qPCR (+) (n = 18) 15 3 0.6 10 8 0.8 16 2 0.4 RT-qPCR (\u2013) 0.8 7.8 4.7 0.04 7.8 2.6 0.1 Urine (n = 40) RT-qPCR (n = 9) 8 1 1 7 2 0.1 8 1 0.7 RT-qPCR (\u2013) 0 0 0 0.06 0 0 0.4 aRT-qPCR, quantitative reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction; SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome; Y, yes; N, no; NPA, nasopharyngeal aspir viral load in stool has not been studied to elucidate transmission and pathogenesis of SARS. the importance of SARS-CoV as a respiratory pathogen is supported by the strong association of viral load in NPA with oxygen desaturation, mechanical ventilation, and death. viremia is reported to be short-lasting in mucosal infections. 5 out of 41 neonates with positive RSV antigen in nasal wash specimens were positive for RSV RNA in blood (21) high levels of adenovirus DNA in serum was also associated with death in children in which adenovirus infection developed. 3N2 were 102.5-107.0 TCID50/mL of nasopharyngeal wash. low incidence of viremia and early peak nasopharyngeal viral load in these two conditions could be explained by inherent characteristics of viral replication, background IgG and IgA. the presence of viral RNA in multiple body sites also indicates poor prognosis. early treatment with an effective antiviral agent before day 10 may decrease the peak viral load, ameliorate symptoms, and improve outcome. early treatment may also reduce viral shedding and thus the risk for transmission."}
