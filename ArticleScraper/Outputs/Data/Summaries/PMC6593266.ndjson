{"summary": "acute diarrhea and potentially its resolution may be affected by either primary or secondary changes in the fecal microbiota. probiotics may represent a viable alternative treatment strategy to antibiotic administration given concerns about antimicrobial efficacy and resistance in acute diarrhea. nitroimidazole is a nitroimidazole antibiotic empirically prescribed for the treatment of acute and chronic canine diarrheal diseases (20\u201324) the mechanism of action for both antibacterial and antiprotozoal effects remains incompletely understood. the drug's effect on both Giardia and Clostridium spp. make it a theoretically attractive choice. dogs with clinical signs consistent with severe acute hemorrhagic diarrhea syndrome characterized by significant dehydration, hypovolemia, or subjectively large volumes of hematochezia were excluded. owners were provided a fecal scoring chart and asked to observe all defecation events. feces were obtained when possible at the time of examination for a fecal flotation and a commercial PCR gastrointestinal panel (Canine Diarrhea RealPCR Panel, IDEXX Laboratories, Westbrook, ME) clinicians were permitted to administer fluid therapy (subcutaneous or intravenous), fenbendazole, and/or maropitant. three treatments included a commercial probiotic product, oral metronidazole, or placebo. both attending clinicians, the clinician obtaining follow-up, and the owners were blinded. all treatments were administered twice daily for 10 days with the first dose administered. dogs were hospitalized based only on owner preference or to facilitate clinician-ordered treatments. owners were given the option of rescue antibiotic treatment during the 10 day treatment period or at study completion (day 10) if diarrhea had not resolved. probiotic potency was tested by the manufacturer at 8 and 18 months. two-proportion z-tests were performed between each treatment group. a previous history of diarrhea, inciting cause, vomiting, hematochezia, fluid therapy, maropitant administration, fenbendazole administration. a backwards linear regression analysis was performed. two-proportion z-tests were performed between each treatment group. a previous history of diarrhea, inciting cause, vomiting, hematochezia, fluid therapy, maropitant administration, fecal flotation and fecal PCR. 63 dogs were enrolled in the study and 60 dogs successfully completed the study. three dogs were withdrawn and not included in the final analysis. no adverse effects in any treatment group were noted. 0.9 11.6

2.2, p = 0.03), fluid therapy ( = 2.6, p = 0.01), and positive fecal flotation ( = 3.8, p = 0.02) as statistically significant categories. dogs in the probiotic group achieved normal fecal consistency after 3.5 2.2 days, 4.5 2.0 in the metronidazole group, and 4.8 3.0 in the placebo group. no dogs were positive for CPE or CPnetEF. study authors until study completion. no significant difference in time to formed feces between first half and second half. dogs with clinical signs suggestive of pancreatitis were excluded from the study. this occurred despite treatment with fenbendazole. previous studies suggest endoparasites do not influence the occurrence of gastrointestinal signs. no dogs were detected with Giardia spp. this is surprising given the prevalence described in other screening studies. the presence of Clostridium spp. is expected. 4.6 vs. 4.8 days would be clinically insignificant even if adequate numbers were to show statistical significance. the minimum dose used in all patients was consistent with empiric dosing for non-specific diarrhea (10\u201315 mg/kg twice daily). the present investigation was similar to another probiotic study of client-owned acute diarrheal dogs. the placebo group took a significantly longer time to achieve clinical resolution of diarrhea (6.6 2.7 days) compared to the current study (22) that cohort was comprised of younger dogs residing at a guide-dog training facility. a mismatch between commercial probiotic claims and actual potency appears common in the pet supplement market. the degraded product should likely not be considered equivalent to placebo. previous studies of diarrhea provided 2\u201312 billion CFU for an average-sized dog. the total number of diarrhea cases presented to this tertiary referral center were not recorded during this period. owners declining participation was not tracked given the large number of clinicians attending to such cases. the impact of previous episodes of diarrhea might also have been explained with such data. the use of metronidazole in acute diarrhea does not appear warranted in this cohort characterized by mild to moderate signs of hemorrhagic or non-hemorrhagic acute diarrhea. the study was underpowered and a larger study should be performed. potential conflict of interest."}
