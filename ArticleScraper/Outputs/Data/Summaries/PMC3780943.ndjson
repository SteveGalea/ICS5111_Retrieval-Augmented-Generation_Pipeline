{"summary": "researchers in the united states and the united kingdom examined the lungs of young soldiers who had died within a few days of contacting the disease. they found that the changes in the lungs were typified by the appearance of a non-cellular homogeneous exudate which was eosinophilic, and this was thought to be due to the presence of albumin coming from the serum. the emergence of H5N1 in isolated cases and the 2009 pandemic demonstrated a crucial factor in the understanding of influenza pathogenesis. in fatal cases in the 2009 pandemic large numbers of influenza antigen positive cells were present in the lungs of fatal cases. in contrast, patients who died of H5N1 rarely had abundant numbers of antigen positive cells - even though changes of diffuse alveolar damage were present [9-11] the first protein is called a haemagglutinin because studies by Hirst in 1942 demonstrated that the influenza virus was able to cause haemagglutination of red blood cells [17]. further studies by Blixt and colleagues identified the component on the red blood cells that interacted with the HA and this was called sialic acid (Sia) the lectin from the Elderberry bush, Sambuccus nigra(SNA), bound Sia2-6Gal, whereas the lectin from the bark of Maackia amurensis (MAA) preferentially bound glycans with Sia2-3Gal. avian viruses (mainly agglutinating red blood cells with Sia2-3Gal) would not readily infect humans. the first set of mucins are normally secreted by goblet cells of the surface epithelium (MUC5AC and MUC5B) and submucous glands (MUC5B) present in the trachea and bronchi. the membrane associated mucins, such as MUC1 and MUC4, are present at the apical surface of ciliated cells. mucin binds to goblet cells and submucous glands containing purple staining mucin. human viruses preferentially bind to goblet cells while ciliated cells. three classes of lectin have been demonstrated to show anti-influenza activity. the first type. C-lectins, are calcium dependent (C-type) and recognize mannose or galactose. the second barrier to infection is host defence lectins. the SP-A is sialylated and so acts as a decoy receptor. macrophages also recognize the mannose present on viruses. the influence of SP-D on the innate immune response has been studied in SP-D mice. neutrophils are low in number in the alveoli of normal lungs but as a first responder will be recruited into areas of influenza infection. compared with macrophages this cell type has not been investigated in as much detail but this requires more investigation. natural Killer cells These cells do not constitute a major population of inflammatory cells within normal alveoli. ex vivo infections of lung tissues showed viral egress from type 2 rather than type 1 cells. this implies that the destruction of type 1 cells leading to diffuse alveolar damage might not be due to a direct viral cytopathic effect. this may be secondary to a cytokine mediated destruction. TLPR 2 and 4 are present on the cell surface and recognize viral surface glycoproteins. TLR 3 and 7 are present intracellularly and recognized double stranded viral RNA (dsRNA) and single stranded RNA viral RNA9(ssRNA) respectively. this protective effect was seen after pre-stimulation of TLR2 and 4. this pathway also required 2 surface molecules MDM2 and CD14. TLR7 activated in the MHC class II endocytic pathway. a number of good review articles on this pathway are available. feron will act as an autocrine and paracrine function leading to more cytokine and antiviral proteins. feron is thought to act as a positive regulator making the viral RNA complexes more accessible to RIG-I. the change in RIG-I does not lead to degradation in the proteasome but actually is a critical step for subsequent interaction of RIG-I with MAVS. activation pathway in viral infection is increased transcription of cytokines, chemokines and interferons. type 1 interferons are the major cytokines that limit viral replication with TNF, IL-1 and IL-6 recruiting immune cells to the sites of infection. in the 2009 pandemic autopsy studies demonstrated viral antigen in endothelial cells. polarized endothelial cells can be infected in vitro. polarized endothelial cells can be infected in vitro. recombinant influenza lacking a gene called non-structural protein (NS1) suppresses this IFN pathway. NS1 inhibition of this abolishes this activity. a distinctive feature of the 1918 H1N1 NS1 and of many avian strains (including H5N1) is a ESEV binding motif for a PDZ domain that mediates protein interaction. studies by soubries and colleagues used reverse genetics to insert different motifs into the mouse adapted A/WSN/33. the changes in replication between ESEV and RSKV were species specific. ESEV induced higher levels of IFN than RSKV in mouse cells. this ESKV was less sensitive to type 1 interferon pre-treatment. evidence for a role for IFN in anti-influenza virus response has been shown through the use of IFN/ receptor deficient mice. IFN has been shown as an effective control of hepatitis B and C in humans, particularly active HCV, in which IFN has cured 98% of affected individuals."}
