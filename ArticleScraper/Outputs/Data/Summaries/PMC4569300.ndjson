{"summary": "despite advances in the development of antiviral drugs, a poor understanding of the immune mechanisms underlying viral FH has largely stalled the identification of effective clinical interventions. the recent development of an animal model of FH using murine hepatitis virus strain-3 (MHV-3) infection has provided insights in understanding the pathogenesis and developing novel therapeutics for the disease. NLRP3 inflammasome and IL-1 mediate host protection against pathogen invasions. the role of NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway participates in pathogenesis of viral FH is still unclear. reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate are considered to be one of the major factors that activate NLRP3 inflammasome. mitochondria-originated ROS (MitoSOX) rather than NOX-derived ROS drive NLRP3 inflammasome activation [15, 16]. stress condition, including increased metabolic rates, hypoxia, or membrane damage, all significantly induce MitoSOX secretion [17] Conversely, it remains uncertain for which of the NOX-derived ROS or MitoSOX is responsible for causing NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent pathology in viral FH development. primary peritoneal exudative macrophages (PEMs) and the macrophage line-RAW264.7 cells were infected with the virus in vitro. a time course data showed a significant induction of the activated form of IL-1 (IL-1 p17) within 12 hours, sustaining to 48h. proIL-1 mRNA expression in the infected livers appeared to be markedly augmented at 48h (p = 0.0231), the expression of proIL-1 and IL-1 p17 in virus-infected liver tissues was detected by western-blotting. the proIL-1 protein in PEMs isolated from MHV-3 infected mice was detected by flow cytometry. ary glycoprotein-1 (Bgp1) appeared to be significantly lower in the virus infected IL-1R1 -/- livers compared to that in the WT controls. the MHV-3 infection efficiency in IL-1R1 -/- PEMs dropped more significantly than in the WT counterparts in vivo. recombinant mouse IL-1 protein (20 ng/ml) is able to significantly induce Bgp1 expression in PEMs and R the survival rate was monitored for a total of 20 days. the liver architecture was analyzed by H&E staining. serum ALT/AST levels were determined with an AU5400 biochemistry analyzer. MHV-3 infected IL-1R1 -/- mice and their C57BL/6 littermates. IL-1R1 -/- mice responded with limited fibrinogen formation. MHV-3 failed to induce FGL2 production and neutrophil infiltration in the livers of IL-1R1 -/- mice. flow cytometry measured liver neutrophil infiltration. IL-1 and TNF- synergistically activate NF-B for FGL2 induction in macrophages A. qPCR and western-blotting data showed that IL-1 alone is incapable of stimulating FLG2 expression. IL-1 synergistically acts with TNF- to promote FGL2 overexpression. expression of fgl2 was detected by immunofluorensent double staining. IL-1 and TNF- treatment alone, had minimum stimulation on phosphorylation of the NF-B chaperone IB (p-IB) and the NF-B subunit p65 (p-p65), appearing only at extended incubation time point (12h) synergistic effects of IL-1 and TNF- (IL-1+TNF-) seemed to be significant for which substantial increases in phosphorylation of IB and p65 can be detected as early as 3h p38-MAPK inhibitor-SB203580 seemed to be incapable of blocking FGL2 expression. NF-B rather than the MAPK pathways is responsible for IL-1+TNF-mediated FGL2 upregulation in viral infected macrophages. MHV-3 stimulates NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent IL-1 activation. NLRP3 -/- mice and Caspase-1 -/- mice appeared to produce much less viruses at 72h of infection as compared to the WT controls. serum C5a in the viral infected NLRP3 -/- and Caspase-1 -/- animals was also significantly increased but no different from the WT controls. IL-1-p17, FGL2 and Bgp1 in NLRP3 -/-, Caspase-1 -/- and C57BL/6 WT livers at 72h and 72h post-infection were measured by western-blotting. cellular apoptosis was analyzed using an AU5400 automatic biochemistry analyzer. p0.05, n = 5 per group, NS: no significant difference. IL-18 -/- mice are sensitive to MHV-3-mediated hepatitis. IL-18 -/- mice are susceptible to MHV-3-mediated hepatitis. IL-18 -/- mice were treated with MHV-3 (100PFU) the expression of FGL2 in MHV-3 infected livers was compared by western-blotting. arrows indicates TUNEL-positive cells, blue color indicates nuclear staining. survival rate of virus-infected mice was monitored for 20 days. p91phox, p47phox and NOX4 subunits are essential for acute ROS secretion in RAW264.7 cells. however, the DCFH level dropped dramatically at 48h and 72h post the viral infection (Fig 7A), most likely owing to death of cells under these conditions. a representative of three experiments with similar results is shown. mitochondria may provide an alternate source of ROS. the viral infection in PEMs and RAW264.7 cells caused an increase in mitochondrial damage, especially at 48h and 72h post-infection. mice are resistance to MHV-3 induced FH by limiting NLRP3 inflammasome hyperactivation Cells in deficiency of p47 phox exhibit a reduced capacity in generating ROS [24] p47 phox-/- mice showed with limited DCFH. p47 phox-/- mice also displayed considerable resistance to MHV-3 infection. p47 phox deficiency limited NLRP3 inflammasome activation and attenuated MHV-3 mediated hepatitis. the peritoneal macrophages (PEMs) were isolated at 24h post-infection. one representative of three experiments with similar results is shown. p47 phox-/- mice were treated with mouse recombinant IL-1 protein (100 ng/day/mouse) the survival rate was monitored. a time course data showed a significant induction of activated form of IL-1 (IL-1 p17) within 12 hours, sustaining to 48h. serum IL-1 concentration exhibited little change in MHV-3 infected mice. this results suggest that IL-1 significantly elevates in the liver and periphery during viral FH. cultured peritoneal exudative macrophages and RAW264.7 cells were infected with MHV-3 (MOI = 1) in vitro. IL-1R1 -/- mice showed a significant increase in survival rate. 60% stay alive for 20 days as compared to 100% death of the littermates within 5 days of the viral infection. expression of biliary glycoprotein-1 (Bgp1) appeared to be significantly lower in the virus infected IL-1R1 -/- livers compared to that in the WT controls. IL-1R1 deficiency attenuates MHV-3-induced hepatitis. mice and their wild-type littermates were infected with MHV-3. survival rate was monitored for a total of 20 days. MHV-3 fails to induce FGL2 production and liver neutrophil infiltration in IL-1R1 -/- mice. IL-1R1 -/- mice responded with limited fibrinogen formation. IL-1R1 -/- mice and their C57BL/6 WT littermates infected with MHV-3. h post-infection was analyzed by western-blotting. four representative samples per group were shown. serum concentration of C5a deteriorates pathogenesis of MHV-3-mediated F. IL-1 and TNF- synergistically activate NF-B for FGL2 induction in macrophages. IL-1 and TNF- synergistically activate NF-B for FGL2 expression in macrophages. IL-1 synergistically enhances TNF-induced FGL2 levels. immunoblot analysis of phosphorylated (p-) and total signaling proteins in whole-cell lysates of RAW264.7 cells stimulated for various times with IL-1, TNF- alone or in the combination. the expression of FGL2 has been proposed to be mediated through the activation of NF-B and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways under inflammatory conditions. inhibition of NF-B activation by PDTC successfully prevented FGL2 upregulation after IL-1+TNF- treatment. the combination of IL-1 and TNF- is capable of potently stimulation the phosphorylation of MAPKs. however, blocking all of these three pathways did not show additive effect on inhibition of FGL2 expression in viral infected macrophages. a 72h viral infection largely failed to induce IL-1 expression in the livers. this was associated with significant reductions in liver FGL2 accumulation. NLRP3 -/- mice and Caspase-1 -/- mice appeared to produce much less viruses at 72h of infection compared to the infected mice. expression of NLRP3 and proCaspase-1 mRNA detected by western-blotting. expression of IL-1-p17, FGL2 and Bgp1 in NLRP3 -/-, Caspase-1 -/- and C57BL/6 WT livers at 72h and 72h post-infection was measured by western-blotting. MHV-3-infected mice showed a significant up-regulation of proIL-18 mRNA in PEMs and livers. however, the recombinant mouse IL-18 protein (50 ng/ml) alone, or in combination with TNF- and INF-, was unable to stimulate fgl2 mRNA transcription in RAW264.7 cells. MHV-3 induced liver FGL2 production remained high in IL-18 -/- mice n = 58 per group, NS: no significant difference. expression of FGL2 in MHV-3 infected livers was compared by western-blotting. survival rate of virus-infected mice was monitored for 20 days. the release of DCFH from MHV-3 infected PEMs and RAW264.7 cells significantly increased. this result correlates with the up-regulation of gp91phox, p47phox and NOX4 subunits essential for acute ROS secretion in RAW264.7 cells. however, the DCFH level dropped dramatically at 48h and 72h post the viral infection. AW264.7 cells were infected with MHV-3 for a total 24h. the secretion of DCFH and MitoSOX was measured by flow cytometry. data were normalized to the increase in fluorescence of the MHV-3 infected alone sample without DPI treatment for each experiment. p47 phox-/- mice are resistance to MHV-3 induced FH. p47 phox-/- mice showed a reduced capacity in generating ROS. p47 phox-/- mice showed a reduced capacity in generating ROS. p47 phox-/- mice were infected with MHV-3 (100PFU) p47 phox-/- mice and their C57BL/6 WT littermates were infected with MHV-3. p47 phox deficiency limited NLRP3 inflammasome activation and attenuated MHV-3 mediated hepatitis. MHV-3 infected p47 phox-/- mice were treated with mouse recombinant IL-1 protein (100 ng/day/mouse) the survival rate was monitored. MHV-3 infection in IL-1R1 -/- mice, or in WT mice treated with IL-1 signaling inhibitors, rescue the otherwise susceptible animals from the viral FH status. the bioprocess of IL-1 maturation is under the control of a key signaling pathway, involving a MHV-3 virus inducible, ROS-dependent NLRP3 inflammasome activation. IL-1 and IL-18 are key inflammatory cytokines produced by macrophages which play a pivotal role in antimicrobial immunity. animals display a significant reduction in viral duplication, amelioration of liver damage and a prolonged survival rate against MHV-3 infection. IL-1R1 deficiency leads to limit liver recruitment of CD45+Gr-1high neutrophils and decrease in production of the macrophage-derived FGL2. but the expression of Bgp1 drops significantly in the IL-1R1-/- liver during the viral infection. inhibition of p38-MAPK and NF-kB can abolish FGL2 expression. inhibition of ERK1/2 and p38-MAPK effectively block C5a-mediated FGL2 upregulation. IL-1 and TNF- synergistically induce NF-B, ERK and p38-MAPK. MHV-3 triggered NLRP3, ASC and Caspase-1 mRNA. loss of either NLRP3 or Caspase-1 in macrophages reduces IL-1 secretion. previous study showed that MHV-3 viruses do not release mature IL-1 because they do not express ASC. MHV-3 triggers NOX-derived ROS secretion in macrophages by inducing NOX-subunits, including GP91phox, p47phox and p67phox. preventing NOX-derived ROS through DPI appeared to successfully down modulate NLRP3 hyperactivation and IL-1 maturation in vitro. the release of MitoSOX was unable to be successfully blocked by ROS inhibitor- DPI (50 uM) reduced mortality and pathology were seen in MHV-3 infected p47 phox-/- mice compared to WT littermates. IL-18 deficiency does not prevent Bgp1 expression, virus amplification and FGL2 accumulation in the liver following MHV-3 infection. these mice stay high with fibrinogen deposition, liver damage and hepatocyte necrosis. IL-1 production plays a double-edged role in the host immune system. MHV-3 viruses were expanded in murine 17CL1 cells to a concentration of 1107 plaque forming unit (PFU)/ml. mice were treated with IL-1R antagonist (IL-1Ra, 10 mg/kg/day) or recombinant mouse IL-1 protein (100 ng/day/mouse) every day. real-time quantitative RT-PCR Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells or liver tissues with TRIzol reagent according to manufacturer's instructions. expression of mRNA encoding for NLRP3, Caspase-1, proIL-1 and proIL-18 was quantified by real-time quantitative PCR with the SYBR Premix ExTaq kit (Takara, Dalian, China) the secretion of NOX-derived ROS was detected by an oxidation-sensitive fluorescent probe-DCFH according to the manufacturer's instructions. cells were stained with MitoSOX (5 M, Invitrogen) for 20 min. a total of 10,000 live cells were analyzed. mice were kept in micro-isolator cages, fed with standard laboratory chow diet and water. all animals received humane care according to the criteria outlined in the \"Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\" the sources of antibodies and other reagents are detailed in S1 Text. cellular apoptosis was measured by TUNEL staining according to manufacturer's instructions. expression of fibrinogen and FGL2 was detected by immunohistochemistry. flow cytometry The release of IL-1/ROS from virus infected macrophages, liver infiltration of CD45+GR-1high neutrophil and CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Treg) all were detected by flow cytometry (FACsAria cytometer, BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) the death cells were excluded firstly by staining with LIVE/DEATH Fixable Near-IR Ded Cell Stain Kit ethics statement All animal experiments were performed in strict accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals issued by the People's Republic of China. the protocol was approved by the Third Military Medical University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. IL-1R1 -/- mice and their C57BL/6 WT littermates were infected with MHV-3 (100 PFU) the percentage of CD4+Foxp3+ Tregs in liver tissue was detected by flow cytometry. cellular apoptosis was analyzed using TUNEL staining at the indicated time points. arrow indicates positive cells; blue color indicates nuclear staining with DAPI. restoration of IL-1 exacerbates MHV-3-mediated hepatitis in p47 phox-/- mice."}
