{"summary": "avirulent feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) and virulent feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) both FECV and FECV have two serotypes, type I and type II FCoVs. a small portion of cats develop FIP during the course of FECV infection and succumb to the disease. FCoV is an enveloped, single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus. it is classified as an alphacoronavirus. replication and transcription occur in the cytoplasm. NEMO interacts with TANK to recruit TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and inhibitor-b kinase (IKK) to the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)\u2013mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) complex in the process of IRF3 and IRF7 activation. FIPV nsp5 inhibited type I IFN production by cleaving multiple sites of NEMO. nsp5-mediated NEMO cleavage disrupted the interaction between TANK and NEMO. this led to inhibition of IRF3 phosphorylation and suppression of type I IFN production. the complete N gene was amplified using a forward primer and reverse primer. the products were cloned into the vector pGEX6p-1. purified GST-N recombinant protein was used as an antigen to inject female BALB/c mice. cDNAs encoding truncated forms of NEMO were cloned by overlap extension PCR using NEMO-WT as the template and constructed into pCAGGS-HA vectors. the plasmids expressing feline Flag-STING, Flag-IRF3, and Flag-IRF3/5D were constitutively active. qRT-PCR was conducted using synthetic cDNA, 10 M of primers, and LightCycler 480 SYBR green I master. cDNA was obtained using an Axygen multisource total RNA miniprep kit. coimmunoprecipitation assays Briefly, cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (PMSF) the lysates were obtained by centrifugation and incubated with the indicated antibodies at 4 \u00b0C overnight on a rotator. the beads were washed six times with phosphate buffered the cells were incubated at 37 \u00b0C in a 5% CO2 humidified cabinet. antibodies, namely mouse anti-Myc (catalogue no. ab9106), rabbit anti-NEMO (catalogue no. ab188569), rabbit anti-IRF3 (catalogue no. ab68481), and rabbit anti-IRF3 (phospho-S386) were purchased from Sigma. nsp5, Flag-nsp5 mutants, and HA-nsp5 mutants were cloned into the p3flag-cmv-10, pCAGGS-HA vectors. cDNAs encoding truncated forms of NEMO were cloned by overlap extension PCR using NEMO-WT. firefly luciferase reporter plasmid IFN--luc at 0.2 g/well and the Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid pRL-TK at 0.02 g/well. the data are presented as relative firefly luciferase activities normalized to Renilla luciferase activities. IFN--reverse (5\u2032-CTCCATGATTTCCTCCAGGAT-3\u2032), fe-IFITM1-reverse (5\u2032-GACTTCACGGAGTAGGCAAAG-3\u2032), fe-ISG15-reverse (5\u2032-TTCAGCCAGAGAAG-3\u2032), fe-Viperin-reverse (5\u2032-GCAAGGATGTCCAAATATTCACC-3\u2032), fe-18s-reverse (5\u2032- the images were collected with the Odyssey infrared imaging system (L1-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA) we found that FIPV-DF2 infection barely induced Viperin (Figure 1B), ISG15 (Figure 1C), and IFITMI (Figure 1D) mRNA levels. DF2 infection inhibits SEV-or poly(I:C)-induced IFN- production. the IFN- promoter luciferase reporter system and qRT-PCR were used to analyze IFN- production. the levels of IFN- mRNA were detected by qRT-PCR. cells were co-transfected with IFN- promoter luciferase reporter plasmid and pRL-TK for 24 h. the cells were mock-infected or infected with increasing concentrations of DF2. cells were evaluated by qRT-PCR and dual luciferase reporter assay. the results showed that FIPV nsp5 inhibited SEV or poly(I:C)-induced IFN- promoter activation in a dose-dependent manner. nsp5 double-mutant H41A/C144A completely abolishes its protease activity [41] at 24 hpi, the cells were infected with 20 hemagglutinating activity units of SEV (A) or transfected with poly(I:C) (2 g/mL) (B) at 20 hpi, the cells were collected and the luciferase activities were measured. expression levels of indicated proteins were analyzed by Western blot. the results showed that FIPV nsp5 significantly inhibited IFN- promoter activation induced by RIG-I, MAVS, NEMO-K277A (a constitutively active NEMO mutant), TBK1 and IRF3-5D (a constitutively active form of IRF3). HEK293T cells were transfected with a HA-tagged feline RIG-I, MAVS, NEMO, NEMOK277A nsp5 cleaved NEMO and porcine NEMO at glutamine 231(Q231) to produce one cleavage product. previous research revealed that PEDV nsp5 cleaved both human NEMO and porcine NEMO at glutamine 231(Q231) to produce one cleavage product. HEK293T cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing IFN- promoter luciferase reporter plasmid and pRL-TK. at 28 hpi, the cells were lysed and luciferase assays were performed. 93T cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding NEMO (2 g) the cells were prepared and analyzed by Western blot. NEMO: NF-B essential modulator. all experiments were repeated three times. HEK293T cells expressing NEMO and nsp5 were treated with a pan-caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD-FMK), proteasome inhibitor (MG132) or lysosome inhibitor (NH4CL) none of the three inhibitors prevented FIPV nsp5-mediated NEMO cleavage. HEK293T cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing NEMO. cells were pretreated with MG132 (20 m), Z-VAD-FMK (80 m) or NH4CL (10 mM) at 30 hpi, cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by Western blot. nsp5-mediated NEMO cleavage fragments were co-expressed with flag-tagged nsp5 or flag-tagged nsp5DM in HEK293T cells. NEMO was in charge of physically interacting with TANK and recruiting TBK1 and IKK to the RIG-I\u2013MAVS complex in process of virus-induced activation of IRF3 and IRF7. the interaction between TANK and NEMO was attenuated in the presence of nsp5. nsp5-mediated NEMO cleavage inhibited the phosphorylation of IRF3. nsp5 was involved in the suppression of type I IFN production. the cell lysates and the immunoprecipitants were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody. the cells were transfected with increasing amounts of nsp5-expressing plasmids. the lysates were then subjected to immunoblotting with anti-phospho-IRF3 (1:100), anti-IRF3 (1:100), anti-Flag (1:3000) and anti-actin (1:3000) antibodies. DF2 infection failed to activate IFN- promoter activity in cRFK cells. the cells were either mock-infected or infected with increasing concentrations of feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV)-DF2 (moi = 0.01, 0.1, 1). at 12 hpi, the cells were lysed and luciferase assays were performed. CRFK cells were mock-infected or infected with increasing concentrations of FIPV-DF2 (moi = 0.01, 0.1, 1) for 12 h. levels of IFN- mRNA were detected by qRT-PCR. the effect of FIPV nsp5 overexpression on SEV or poly(I:C)-mediated IFN- production in a protease-dependent maner was evaluated by qRT-PCR and dual luciferase reporter assay. the results showed that FIPV nsp5 inhibited SEV or poly(I:C)-induced IFN- promoter activation in HEK293T cells. HEK293T cells were co-transfected with IFN- promoter reporter plasmid and pRL-TK, along with increasing amounts of FIPV-nsp5 (200 ng, 400 ng, 800 ng) at 24 hpi, the cells were infected with 20 hemagglutinating activity units of SEV (A) or transfected with poly(I:C) (2 g/mL) (E) HEK293T cells were transfected with FIPV nsp5 or nsp5 mutants (800 ng) followed by mock infection or SEV infection. at 20 hpi, the cells were collected and the mRNA levels of IFN- were evaluated by qRT-PCR. NEMO and NEMOK277A were cleaved by FIPV nsp5 but no cleavage products were observed in other adaptor proteins. previous research revealed that PEDV nsp5 cleaved both human NEMO and porcine NEMO at glutamine 231(Q231) to produce one cleavage product. HEK293T cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing nsp5, nsp5H41A, nsp5C144A, nsp5DM (nsp5H41A/C144A) or empty vector. none of the mutants did so (Figure 3H) HEK293T cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding NEMO (2 g) at 30 hpi, the cells were prepared and analyzed by Western blot. NEMO: NF-B essential modulator. all experiments were repeated three times. HEK293T cells expressing NEMO and nsp5 were treated with a pan-caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD-FMK), proteasome inhibitor (MG132) or lysosome inhibitor (NH4CL), respectively. the results showed that none of the three inhibitors prevented FIPV nsp5-mediated NEMO cleavage. HEK293T cells were either mock-infected or infected with increasing concentrations of DF2. levels of endogenous NEMO decreased in a dose-dependent manner compared with mock-infected cells. at 30 hpi, cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by western blot. the activation of the IFN- promoter induced by NEMOK277A was significantly inhibited in the presence of FIPV nsp5. we speculated that FIPV nsp5-mediated cleavage of NEMOK277A likely debilitated the ability to induce IFN- expression. HA-tagged NEMO and Myc-tagged TANK were co-expressed with flag-tagged nsp5 or flag-tagged nsp5DM in HEK293T cells. the interaction between TANK and NEMO was attenuated by nsp5 because of the cleavage of NEMO caused by nsp5. nsp5-mediated NEMO cleavage inhibited the IRF3 phospho HEK293T cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing HA-tagged NEMO (1 g), along with a plasmid expressing Myc-tagged TANK or a vector plasmid (1 g) the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody. the lysates were then subjected to immunoblotting with anti-phospho-IRF3 (1:100), anti-IRF3 (1: coronavirus nsp5-encoded 3C-like protease (3CLpro) plays an important role in virus replication and immune evasion. the EV71 virus inhibits toll-like receptor 3-mediated antiviral responses through the cleavage of TRIF and IRF7 by 3Cpro. nsp5 regulated its interferon antagonism by cleaving porcine NEMO at a single site, Q231, concomitant with the same human NEMO cleavage products. the size of the largest fragment in FIPV nsp5-medated cleavage was consistent with that in PEDV nsp5-mediated cleavage. many distinct domains include TANK-binding domain [30], two coil-coiled domains (CC1 and CC2), a leucine zipper region, and a zinc finger domain. however, we failed to detect the endogenous cleavage products of NEMO in FIPV-infected CRFK cells. NEMO mutant with internal deletion of residues 196\u2013250 [30] failed to associate with TBK1 or IKK in cells co-expressing TANK [31,32]. further investigation revealed that the interaction between TANK and NEMO was attenuated in the presence of FIPV nsp5. nsp5 inhibits SEV-induced IRF3 phosphorylation. nsp5-mediated NEMO cleavage disrupted the interaction between TANK and NEMO. the kinases phosphorylate IRF3, leading to the induction of type I IFN."}
