{"summary": "MERS-CoV is an enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus. it encodes the 5\u2032-replicase structural protein (spike-envelope-membrane-nucleocapsid)-poly (A-3\u2032.13, 14, 15 The highly glycosylated spike (S) protein mediates viral infections and is a primary determinant of cell tropism and pathogenesis. the S1 subunit (residues 1\u2013751) facilitates the subsequent fusion of the virus with the host cell membrane. to deliver the viral nucleic acid into the host cell membrane, the S1 subunit (residues 752\u20131353) facilitates the subsequent fusion of the virus with the host cell membrane. the MERS-CoV RBD maps to a 200\u2013300 residue region spanning residues 358\u2013588, 367\u2013588, 367\u2013606, 377\u2013588 and 377\u2013662. the specific interaction between MERS-CoV RBD and its receptor DPP4 (also known as CD26) has also been revealed at the atomic level by structural analysis. ed with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% penicillin-streptomycin (P/S), 1% l-glutamine and 1% HEPES. hybridomas were cultured in DMEM with 20% FBS, 2% hypoxanthine aminopterin thymidine and 1% P/S. mice were immunized with 35 g MERS-CoV rS combined with 150 L Freund\u2019s complete adjuvant. mice were killed 3 days after the last immunization, and their splenocytes were fused with mouse myeloma cells. Isotype classification of purified mAbs was performed using the AKTA system. 96-well ELISA plates were coated with the recombinant proteins (1 g/mL) or 18 aa peptides (2.5 g/mL) after blocking, the mAbs were added to the wells and incubated for 1.5 h at 37 \u00b0C. different concentrations of purified rNTD were run at a flow rate of 10 L/min in PBS-P+buffer. surface was regenerated with 10 mM glycine-HCl (pH 1.5) Western blot analysis Purified MERS-CoV rS and rNTD were analyzed on 12% SDS\u2013polyacrylamide gels. the culture medium was renewed with fresh medium containing 2% FBS 18\u201320 h post-infection. luciferase activity was determined after an additional 48 h incubation using an Infinite M1000 illuminometer. the neutralizing activity of the mAbs against live MERS-CoV was also determined in DPP4-expressing Vero E6 cells. RPMI 1640 containing 20% FBS, 1% P/S, 1% l-glutamine and 1% HEPES. all cells were cultured at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2. all reagents were purchased from Gibco (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) the mouse mAb Isotyping Kit was purchased from Pierce (Life Technologies) the HiTrap protein G columns, Protein A sensor chip, 10 PBS-P buffer and 10 mM glycine-HCl were purchased from GE Healthcare. mice were killed 3 days after the last immunization, and their splenocytes were fused with mouse myeloma cells. 96-well ELISA plates were coated with recombinant proteins (1 g/mL) or 18 aa peptides (2.5 g/mL) after blocking, the mAbs were added to the wells and incubated for 1.5 h at 37 \u00b0C. the binding activity was determined at 450 nm using a plate reader (Multiskan MK3) Western blot analysis Purified MERS-CoV rS and rNTD were analyzed on 12% SDS\u2013polyacrylamide gels supplemented with 2 SDS after boiling for 15 min. the denatured proteins were then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, blocked with 5% non-fat milk in PBST for 1 h at room temperature, and probed overnight with 1 g/mL mAb. a panel of mAbs targeting the S protein (aa 1\u20131297) was generated using a traditional hybridoma fusion protocol. nine rS-ELISA binding mAbs covering the RBD, the NTD and outside these two regions were selected from 37 clones. mAbs (5F9, 2B4, 7D7, 1F4, 3A2, 4A6, 4F8, 4C5 and 1B5) were mapped to different regions of the MERS-CoV S protein using ELISA. each of the selected mAbs (1 g/mL), anti-N9 mAb (1 g/mL) and anti-serum (1:10 000) were evaluated for their neutralizing activity against pseudotyped MERS-CoV. mAbs 5F9, 1F4, 4A6 and 4F8 exhibited greater than 50% neutralization potency at 1 g/mL compared to pre-fusion mouse serum (1:10 000 dilution). the rRBD-binding mAb 1F4 showed the strongest neutralizing activity (100%); another two mAbs (4A6 and 4F8) and one novel rNTD-binding mAb (5F9) exhibited efficient neutralizing activity (over 50%). anti-RBD, anti-N9 mAb and PBS were used as the positive, unrelated and blank controls. the binding kinetics between 5F9 and rNTD were calculated using SPR. mAb 5F9 neutralized the live MERS-CoV infection, with the same IC50 of 0.2 g/mL. mAb 5F9 neutralized the live MERS-CoV infection, with the same IC50 of 0.2 g/mL. mAb 5F9 efficiently bound both the MERS-CoV rNTD (aa 18\u2013353) and rS (Figure 5A) an 18 aa peptide ELISA was performed to locate the binding site of 5F9. these results suggest a possible linear binding epitope between 5F9 and the NTD. a panel of mAbs targeting the S protein (aa 1\u20131297) was generated using a traditional hybridoma fusion protocol. nine rS-ELISA binding mAbs covering the RBD, the NTD and outside these two regions were selected from 37 clones. mAb Isotype Binding region Neutralization of MERS-CoV ppa RBD NTD S1 S2 S 5F9 IgG2b, + + + 50%\u201390% 2B4 IgG2a, + + + 50% 7D7 IgG2b, + + + + 50% 1F4 IgG2a, + + + >90% 3A2 IgG2b, + + + 50% 4F8 IgG2b, + mAbs (4A6 and 4F8) and one novel rNTD-binding mAb (5F9) showed efficient neutralizing activity (over 50%) the other five mAbs, including 1B5 (rS2-binding mAb), exhibited less than 20% neutralization activity. the mAb 5F9 was therefore selected for further characterization and evaluation. 5F9 showed nanomolar affinity for the rNTD (equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) equivalent to 5.42 nM) we determined the lowest concentration of the mAb that can effectively inhibit pseudovirus MERS-CoV entry. mAb 5F9 neutralized the live MERS-CoV infection, with the same IC50 of 0.2 g/mL. mAb 5F9 effectively bound both the MERS-CoV rNTD (aa 18\u2013353) and rS (Figure 5A) mAb 5F9 bound to denatured rS and rNTD. pre-fusion mouse serum (anti-serum) was used as a positive control. each peptide was coated onto a 96-well plate at 250 ng/well. structural docking of the MERS-CoV S protein revealed the NTD and C-terminal RBD of the S1 subunit, which form extensive quaternary interactions with each other. these features may suggest that certain epitopes on the NTD of MERS-CoV S1 are structurally or functionally close to those on the RBD. the S proteins of the Coronaviridae family, consisting of four genera (-, -, - and -CoVs), are also class I envelope glycoproteins. all use the S1 protein RBD or NTD to interact with cellular receptors or co-receptors. multiple evaluations of full length S-based or truncated S1-based vaccines indicate that an increase in epitope range would be important for future MERS-CoV vaccine designs. our study suggested that the NTD should be considered an immunogenic component."}
