{"summary": "fingolimod is the first oral drug approved by the fda for treatment of patients with the relapsing-remitting form of the human demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis. the therapeutic benefit of FTY720 occurs by preventing the egress of lymphocytes from lymph nodes thereby inhibiting the infiltration of disease-causing lymphocytes into the central nervous system. FTY720-treated mice showed a reduction in the severity of demyelination associated with dampened neuroinflammation. findings indicate that FTY720 mutes effective anti-viral immune responses."}
