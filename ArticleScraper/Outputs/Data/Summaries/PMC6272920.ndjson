{"summary": "some naturally derived compounds, such as taxol and vincristine, have long been widely used as anticancer agents. saponins exert various pharmacological effects, including cardiovascular protective activity [4], anti-inflammatory [5], antiviral [6], and immunoregulatory effects [7]. saponins ginsenoside, saikosaponin, dioscin, polyphyllin, and timosaponin. this work will hopefully serve as a reference for further development of saponins as anticancer agents. more than 100 ginsenosides have been isolated from Ginseng radix. ginsenoside Rg3 demonstrates therapeutic effects in vitro and/or in vivo against various tumors, including leukemia [22], lung cancer [23], esophageal carcinoma [24], gastric cancer [25], colon cancer [26,27,28], hepatoma [29,30], renal cancer [31], bladder cancer [33], ovarian cancer [34], prostate cancer [35,36] and melanoma [37,38,39]. ginsenoside Rg3 treatment affects a broad range of signaling pathways and factors, including downregulation or deactivation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) [52,53], inactivation of NF-B by reducing phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) and protein kinase B (AKT) [37], modulation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) [36], down-regulation of ginsenoside Rg3 can inhibit growth and survival of gastric cancer cells. ginsenoside Rg3 also exhibits other anticancer properties. ginsenoside Rh2 demonstrates potent anticancer effects against various cancer types. ginsenoside Rh2 can effectively inhibit tumor growth without overt toxicity. it induces cell cycle

isolated from Ginseng radix. they are classified into protopanaxadiol, protopanaxatriol, ocotillol, and oleanolic acid types. the main structural difference between the PPD and PPT types is the presence of sugar residues attached to an -OH at C-6 and the absence of -OH at C-3 in the PPT moiety. combination therapy of ginsenoside Rg3 with other chemotherapeutic agents has become the focus of recent research. in vivo studies have suggested that ginsenoside Rg3 reduces tumor growth, but also enhances cellular immunity. ginsenoside Rg3 can inhibit the growth and survival of gastric cancer cells via blockade of the activity of transient receptor potential melastatin 7 channel. ginsenoside Rg3 also exhibits other anticancer properties, such as declination of fucosyltransferase IV (FUT4)

LNCaP cells [146]. dioscin increased the levels of NO and inducible NO synthase [143]. dioscin treatment significantly increases the expression of Fas, FasL, TNF-, TNFR-1, and FADD. in breast cancer cells, dioscin treatment induces cell death via caspase-independent pathway and downregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins, such as Bcl-2, cIAP-1, and Mcl-1. dioscin exerts anti-invasive effect, along with anti-proliferation, against breast cancer cells by enhancing GATA-binding protein 3. polyphyllin D eliminates MDR in R-HepG2 cells [166], inhibits P-gp-mediated daunorubicin efflux in NIH3T3
