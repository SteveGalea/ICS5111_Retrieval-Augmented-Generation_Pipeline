{"summary": "live-attenuated vaccines can stimulate both cellular and humoral immune responses, and induce prolonged immunity that closely resembles natural infection. there are safety concerns associated with the use of the live attenuated virus or bacterial vaccines as they may revert to disease causing forms. the advantages of DNA vaccines compared to conventional vaccines are summarized in Table 1. they are highly flexible, encoding several types of genes including viral and bacterial antigens, as well as immunological proteins. in 2012, a human HIV-1 gag DNA vaccine with or without interleukin (IL)-12 and/or IL-15 plasmid cytokine adjuvant was reported to produce poor cellular immunogenicity with no vaccine-induced anti-gag humoral immune responses on healthy volunteers. intranasal DNA vaccination has become a promising approach in offering immune protection against various pathogens that affect the respiratory system. mechanisms of action of DNA vaccines are illustrated in Figure 1. Principles of DNA Vaccines 2.1. Principles of DNA Vaccines. s activate B cells, leading to antibodies production. s migrate to lymph nodes where they present antigenic peptides. antigens expressed in somatic cells may not be the major player in eliciting immune response. unmethylated CpG activates innate immune cells through binding to toll-like receptor 9 (TLR-9), which is constitutively expressed in the endosomal compartments of APCs and B cells. TLR-9 deficient mice responded to DNA vaccines, suggesting that TLR-9 may not be the sole mediator of the adjuvant effect. the efficacy of vaccines such as influenza vaccine could be monitored in human during subsequent influenza epidemic season. but some lethal virus challenge studies are difficult to conduct directly on human. the measurement of antibodies production and immune responses in humans remains the most direct way to assess vaccine efficacy. antibiotic resistance is another issue related to DNA vaccines. antibiotic-resistance genes should be restricted to those that are not used to treat human infections. newborns are more likely to develop tolerance rather than protection when exposed to foreign antigens. intramuscular injection of DNA vaccines showed low gene expression and low inflammatory cell infiltration. however, the long-term safety effect was not investigated. DNA vaccines are relatively new vaccination approaches and yet to be approved in human use. duction of CD8+ T-cells by DNA vaccines can occur in two major ways: direct DNA transfection of the APCs such as dendritic cells (DCs); cross-presentation occurs when transfected apoptotic cells are phagocytosed by the APCs. early studies showed that DNA vaccines are poorly immunogenic with low levels of antigen expression. unmethylated CpG motifs have immunostimulatory effect and are considered pathogen-associated molecular patterns. unmethylated CpG activates innate immune cells through binding to toll-like receptor 9 (TLR-9) a prolonged expression of antigen may lead to the switch of type-1 IFN from an antiviral cytokine to an immunosuppressive cytokine [26], or may deplete the pool of memory T cells [27]. serum antibodies and the enzyme-linked immunoSpot (ELISpot) assays are the commonly employed methods to measure the immunogenic response. there is little evidence of genomic integration following DNA vaccines administration. the risk of integration is significantly lower than the spontaneous mutation rate. there has been no increase in anti-nuclear or anti-DNA antibodies after DNA vaccination. the first clinical trial of a DNA-based vaccine for HIV-1 infection was published in 1998 in 15 asymptomatic HIV-infected patients who were not using antiviral drugs. the immunization was well tolerated with neither local, systemic reaction nor laboratory abnormalities were detected after three doses of vaccines. however, the long-term safety effect was not investigated. intranasal route of administration is characterized by easy administration, rapid onset of action and avoidance of first-pass metabolism. needle-free administration route is non-invasive and can avoid the risk of spreading blood-borne infections. majority of currently available vaccines are administered by intramuscular, subcutaneous or intradermal injection. nasopharyngeal-associated lymphoid tissue is known as the nasopharyngeal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT), which includes the Waldeyer\u2019s ring of tonsils, adenoids and a collection of isolated subepithelial lymphoid follicles [63]. the NALT is rich in immunocompetent cells, including B cells, T cells and phagocytic APCs such as macrophag M cells are efficient in taking up particles from the epithelial surface. this process is known as transcytosis. at their basal surface, the cell membrane of M cells is extensively folded around the underlying immune cells. serum IgA and serum IgG can potentially neutralize pathogens that enter the nasal mucosa and prevent systemic spread. cells of NALT are involved in the regulation of humoral and cell-mediated immune responses locally and also systemically, offering a broad immune response. the effect of mucus depends on its viscosity and pore size, which affects the diffusivity of agents delivered to mucosal surfaces. the entrapped DNA vaccines may also be removed by the mucociliary action of the ciliated cells that drives the overlying mucus layer continuously towards the nasopharynx, clearing the mucus from the nasal passage. fluMist\u00ae and NASOVAC\u00ae are intranasal live-attenuated influenza vaccines without enterotoxin as adjuvants. enterotoxins were found in the olfactory nerve and the olfactory bulb for an extended period. intranasal route of administration is characterized by easy administration, rapid onset of action and avoidance of first-pass metabolism. the needle-free route is non-invasive and can avoid the risk of spreading blood-borne infections, which is a particular problem in developing countries. mucosal vaccination can induce humoral and cell-mediated immune response systemically as well as at mucosal sites. the nasopharyngeal-associated lymphoid tissue is known as the nasopharyngeal-associated lymphoid tissue. sIgA is a critical component in the mucosal immune system. it can effectively bind and neutralize pathogens and their toxic products on the nasal mucosa surface despite the protease rich environment. sIgG concentration is around 30\u2013100-fold lower than that of the sIgA. the cytotoxic T cells in the mucosal tissues may not prevent pathogen entry, but they are crucial for the clearance of pathogens. the nasal mucosa is an important portal of entry for respiratory pathogens. it has become an important barrier to intranasal DNA vaccines. entrapped DNA vaccines may also be removed by the mucociliary action of the ciliated cells that drives the overlying mucus layer continuously towards the nasopharynx. another challenge of intranasal vaccine is that the vaccine formulation may be diluted in mucosal fluids. bulk fluid may limit effective deposition onto the epithelium of the mucosal system. fluMist\u00ae and NASOVAC\u00ae are intranasal live-attenuated influenza vaccines without enterotoxin as adjuvants. enterotoxins were found in the olfactory nerve and the olfactory bulb for an extended period. the olfactory epithelium is the only part of the central nervous system. TB is a bacterial infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. the only TB vaccine currently available is an attenuated strain of Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), developed in the 1920s. two new strains, severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) have been identified. most of these DNA vaccines encode mycobacterial proteins that are either secreted in mycobacterial culture filtrate or exposed on the viral surface. zoonotic or variant influenza has become a serious threat to human health, including the avian influenza virus H5N1 and H9N2 and the swine influenza virus H1N1 and H3N2. if such a virus acquired the capacity to spread easily among people, it could start an epidemic or even a pandemic. syncytial virus (RSV) is a single stranded RNA pneumovirus. it accounts for one of the leading pathogeneses of lower respiratory tract infections and hospitalization in infants and young children. immunity against RSV is dependent on the induction of antibodies responses. effective protective immunity to mycobacterium tuberculosis requires cell-mediated immune responses, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells [75,76,77]. DNA vaccines have the ability to induce strong cellular immunity, but it has become an attractive vaccine approach against TB. DNA vaccines that encode nucleocapsid protein induced strong cell-mediated immunity but are not protective after high titer of viral challenge. nucleocapsid DNA vaccine could induce delayed-type hypersensitivity even in the absence of an antibody response. the strategy of combined immunization with DNA vaccines encoding surface protein (e.g., HA) and internal protein (NP and M1) could offer better protection against influenza virus than single DNA vaccine alone in mice and ferrets. several phase I & II clinical trials on DNA vaccine against influenza have been carried out. a safe and efficient DNA delivery system is sometimes employed as adjuvant to facilitate efficient cellular uptake of DNA vaccines. this is because DNA is a negatively charged, hydrophilic macromolecule. it is incapable of crossing the biological membrane unassisted. this is because it is incapable of crossing the biological membrane unassisted. cytotoxic T cells recognize antigen in association with class II MHC proteins. an additional co-stimulatory signal is then produced by the APCs. non-professional APCs lack the co-stimulatory signaling. ligand is a growth factor that stimulates the proliferation of hematopoietic cells. it binds to the fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor Flt3. in vivo treatment of Flt3 ligand is found to up-regulate the number of DCs. a number of studies have been conducted to identify the optimal particle size for cellular uptake of the mucosal system. some studies suggest that particle size of less than 1 m is optimal for oral vaccine delivery for Peyer\u2019s patch M cell uptake. mucosally induced tolerance may develop with M cell targeting delivery system. polymers high versatility is one of the attractive features of polymer-based DNA delivery systems. polymers can form complexes (polyplexes) with nucleic acids through electrostatic interaction. unized intranasally with the PEI\u2013DNA vaccines produced significantly higher systemic spike protein specific IgG and mucosal secretory IgA in the lung compared to those immunized with naked DNA. cellular immune responses were detected with an improvement of specific T cell responses. chitosan is a natural polysaccharide that has been frequently studied for drug delivery. it is derived from chitin which is found abundant in crustacean. it is biodegradable and biocompatible with low toxicity. chitosan nanoparticles were surface functionalized with ligands to achieve DC selective targeted delivery. plasmid DNA encoding nucleocapsid protein of SARS-coV was loaded into the chitosan nanoparticles. chitosan nanoparticles were surface functionalized with ligands. thiolated chitosan derivative has mucoadhesive properties due to the formation of disulphide bonds between thiol groups of modified polymer and cysteine-rich subdomains of glycoproteins in the mucus layer. improved mucoadhesion of up to 140-fold when compared to unmodified chitosan [158] this technology has a huge potential to be adopted for intranasal DNA vaccine delivery. chitosan coated PLGA nanoparticles were first prepared by emulsion-diffusion-evaporation technique. the samples were then frozen-dried with mannitol before use. both cellular and humoral immune responses were detected. liposomes are bound to the surface of a liposome in an array, similar to what is seen on viral particles. the idea is to create a safe viral-like particle that can induce strong protective immune response. similar technology could be applied to DNA vaccines to improve immunogenicity. cationic liposomes were used for intranasal administration. cationic liposomes were entrapped inside or complexed with the lipids. cationic liposomes were used for intranasal administration. liposomal liposomal formulation of DNA vaccine was able to offer protection against infection even after a single dose. but four doses of intranasal administration of naked DNA vaccines failed to offer any protection. authors reasoned that the intranasal vaccination enhance the immune response by stimulating the mucosal immunity. cationic liposomes, PC/DOPE/Chol (Phosphatidylcholine/dioleylphosphatidylethanolamine/cholesterol) were used to entrap plasmid encoding the S region of hepatitis B antigen. cationic liposomes, PC/DOPE/Chol (Phosphatidylcholine/dioleylphosphatidylethanolamine/choleste the summary of DNA vaccine adjuvants being investigated is shown in Table 2. proteins and other macromolecules with immunopotentiating properties are also considered as DNA vaccine adjuvants. in this section, proteins and other macromolecules with immunopotentiating properties are discussed. enterotoxin-based mucosal adjuvants are the most potent and well-established strategy for the induction of both mucosal and systemic immunity to co-administered protein antigens. it is believed that the LT mutant adjuvants could induce potent cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses. both native and mutant LT used as adjuvants were associated with the development of Bell\u2019s palsy following intranasal delivery in humans. the risk of enterotoxin as mucosal adjuvant for intranasal administration is already discussed in Section 3.4. or intranasal vaccine adjuvants include IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-12, IL-15 and GM-CSF. cytokines have short half-life in vivo and poor stability. cytokines may not be suitable for use in vaccines designed to protect against infectious diseases. non-professional APCs lack the co-stimulatory signaling, and therefore do not simulate T cells sufficiently. DCs have the broadest range of antigen presentation and are considered most efficient cells for induction and regulation of immune responses. one of the most widely studied molecules is the Flt3 ligand. it is a growth factor that stimulates the proliferation of hematopoietic cells. it binds to the fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor Flt3. some studies suggest that particle size of less than 1 m is optimal for oral vaccine delivery for Peyer\u2019s patch M cell uptake [131,132,133] another NALT nanoparticle uptake study also suggested that particles with sub-micron size are optimal for mucosal M cells uptake [134] polymers High versatility is one of the attractive features of polymer-based DNA delivery systems. polymers can form complexes (polyplexes) with nucleic acids through electrostatic interaction. polymer synthesis is relatively cheap and easy to scale-up. dPEI is a nearly fully hydrolysed linear PEI with 11% additional free protonatable nitrogen atoms. it is an effective DNA vaccine carrier for pulmonary delivery to elicit both systemic and mucosal immune responses. the properties of chitosan can be tuned by changing molecular weight and degree of deacetylation. chitosan has strong binding affinity with nucleic acids, making it a suitable candidate for DNA delivery agent. chitosan was also reported to have an immunostimulating effect. chitosan nanoparticles were surface functionalized with ligands to achieve DC selective targeted delivery. chitosan nanoparticles were surface functionalized with ligands to achieve DC selective targeted delivery. chitosan derivative has been introduced to improve transfection efficiency. thiolated chitosan derivative has mucoadhesive properties due to the formation of disulphide bonds between thiol groups of the modified polymer and cysteine-rich subdomains of glycoproteins in the mucus layer. improved gene expression could be achieved both in vitro and in vivo with thiolated chitosan derivative. IL-6 was also found to be an effective mucosal adjuvant for intranasal vaccination. the vaccines could offer some immune protection to animals against FMDV challenge. the intranasal administration of the PEI/DNA vaccines induced cellular and humoral immune response. the protection could be further improved by including the plasmid DNA encoding NA. cationic PEI is highly charged and non-biodegradable. the properties of chitosan can be tuned by changing its molecular weight and degree of deacetylation. chitosan has strong binding affinity with nucleic acids, making it a suitable candidate for DNA delivery agent. chitosan was also reported to have an immunostimulating effect. chitosan nanoparticles were surface functionalized with ligands to achieve DC selective targeted delivery. dec-205 receptor is C-type lectin receptor found in DCs for recognition and uptake of pathogens. chitosan derivative has strong mucoadhesive properties. poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) is a synthetic biodegradable copolymer that has been extensively investigated for the delivery of different therapeutic agents including proteins and nucleic acids. this technology has a huge potential to be adopted for intranasal DNA vaccine delivery. nanoparticles were first prepared by emulsion-diffusion-evaporation technique. the samples were then frozen-dried with mannitol before use. both cellular and humoral immune responses were detected. IL-6 was also found to be an effective mucosal adjuvant. the idea is to create a safe viral-like particle that can induce strong protective immune response. liposomes on their own could elicit immune response even in the absence of other antigens. cationic liposome encoding hsp65 was complexed with the lipids. lipid-DNA formulation was capable of inducing a weak cell-mediated immune response. cationic liposome, EPC/DOPE/DOTAP, was used. immunized mice were challenged with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. but intranasal administration of naked DNA failed to offer any protection. intranasal vaccination enhance the immune response by stimulating the mucosal immunity. the naked DNA failed to cross the mucosal barriers in the nasal cavity. liposomes, PC/DOPE/Chol (Phosphatidylcholine/dioleylphosphatidylethanolamine/cholesterol) were used to entrap plasmid encoding the S region of hepatitis B antigen. liposomes could elicit humoral mucosal and cell-mediated immune responses which were better than the uncoated liposomes. such system has the potential to be exploited for mucosal adjuvants for intranasal vaccination are discussed in table 2. a list of mucosal adjuvants for DNA vaccine is presented. enterotoxin-based mucosal adjuvants are the most potent and well-established strategy for the induction of both mucosal and systemic immunity to co-administered protein antigens. the LT mutant adjuvants are extensively investigated as adjuvants for mucosal vaccine including intranasal vaccine. monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) is one example of LPS derivative that is investigated as vaccine adjuvant. MPL is prepared by removal of a phosphate and fatty acid group from the lipid A of Salmonella minnesola. intranasal administration of pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine induced less toxicity than parenteral administration. however, cytokines have short half-life in vivo and poor stability. these molecules may not be suitable for use in vaccines designed to protect against infectious diseases. bacterial/viral inactivated process, incorrect folding of antigen and viral mutation risk. a delivery technology platform could be established to allow the development of DNA vaccine formulations for different infectious diseases in the future."}
