{"summary": "arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) are transmitted to vertebrates by blood-feeding arthropods. they are a major cause of zoonotic diseases (1). many viral proteins considered to be virulence factors block the innate immune system. viruses are encoding antagonists countering the host antiviral responses mediated by ubiquitination and ISGylation (6\u201311) ub represents one of the most conserved eukaryote proteins, whereas ISG15 is absent from invertebrates. this biodiversity of ISG15 has been shown to be a key factor in limiting influenza B virus infection in mice. human ISG15 residues buried in complex with ERVV vOTU are boxed in purple. human ISG15 residues buried in complex with ERVV vOTU are labeled in green. deubiquitinase and deISGylase activity originates from a viral ovarian domain protease (vOTU) homologue encoded on the large (L) RNA segment of its tripartite genome. nairoviruses are NSVs requiring no such activity (17) nairoviruses are tick-borne pathogens, but they infect vertebrate hosts. the brains of mice that have been inoculated with ERVV have shown acute encephalitis and necrosis (23) nairoviruses have a unique ability to cause viremia in a multitude of other species. nairoviruses have a unique ability to cause overt disease in certain species. a protease activity assay was created to determine if vOTUs from different nairoviruses do indeed have a specificity for certain species' ISG15s. this structure, when compared to the vOTU from CCHFV in complex with C-terminal human, has unlocked key residues that begin to answer the question of species specificity utilized by viral proteases. ERVV vOTU and NSDV vOTU were incorporated into pET11a. all vOTUs were expressed and purified as previously described. plasmids were transformed by heat shock into Escherichia coli cells. the cleavage of 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin from the substrate using a CLARIOstar plate reader (BMG Labtech, Inc.) data analysis was performed using MARS (BMG Labtech) proISG15s were lysed in buffer B 500 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 1 mM Tris (2-carbozyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride [TCEP-HCl] and 5 mg of lysozyme for 45 min at 4\u00b0C. insoluble protein was removed by centrifugation at 48,000 g for 45 min. supernatant was flowed over nickel agarose beads equilibrated with buffer C. then washed with buffer C supplemented with 30 mM imidazole. the mature ISG15s were then dialyzed against a buffer containing 50 mM HEPES, 150 mM sodium chloride, and 5 mM -mercaptoethanol. the results were visualized on 10 to 20% mini-PROTEAN Tris-Tricine precast gels. ITC of ISG15 with vOTUs originating from ERVV and CCHFV. column washed with three column volumes of buffer D and resuspended in two column volumes of buffer D supplemented with 250 mM sodium 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate. the resulting thioester was concentrated to reduce the total volume to 20 ml. a total of 480 l of 5 M NaOH and 1.84 g of propargylamine were added to the ERVV vOTU-CmISG15 complex the initial screens yielded needle-like crystals from a condition containing 6% polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG 6000) and 0.1 M citric acid [pH 4.6] this condition was optimized using a Hampton Research Additive HT Screen. the final optimized crystals were grown in hanging drops with 2 l of protein solution mixed 1:1. the expression vectors for vOTUs originating from CCHFV and ERVV were constructed according to previously published protocols (16). the NSDV vOTU domain was identified by homology with CCHFV vOTU as the first 169 amino acids of the L protein (6). mutant plasmids were transformed by heat shock into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) by heat shock. erVV vOTU mutant enzymatic assays performed as previously described. a mutation (C75S) was made in the mouse sequence to prevent aggregation. the mutation corresponds to the C terminus of the immature human ISG15 (proISG15) sequence. insoluble protein was removed by centrifugation at 48,000 g for 45 min. the protein column was washed with buffer B supplemented with 30 mM imidazole and then eluted with buffer B supplemented with 300 mM imidazole. thrombin cleaved and purified by size exclusion chromatography. reactions were incubated with 20 nM concentration of either CCHFV vOTU, ERVV vOTU, or NSDV vOTU. the ISG15s and vOTUs were dialyzed at 4\u00b0C in 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, and 5 mM -mercaptoethanol. all experiments were run in duplicate. g of propargylamine were added to the thioester and left to incubate overnight at 4\u00b0C. to obtain the ERVV vOTU-CmISG15 complex, purified protease was added directly to the mixture in equimolar ratios. eluting from a MonoQ 10/100 column using a linear gradient from 0 to 1 M NaCl with 50 mM Tris. the crystals were flash frozen in a cryoprotective solution containing 30% PEG 6000 and 0.1 M citric acid [pH 4.6] and mounted under a dry N2 stream at 100 K. a data set was collected at the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne National Labs, IL) using a MAR300hs detector. on 60 Water 253 B factors Protein 24.4 Ligand/ion 53.1 Water 23.1 RMSDb Bond lengths (\u00b0) 0.014 Bond angles (\u00b0) 1.71 a Values in parentheses are for highest-resolution shell. the effect of this species diversity on viral deISGylase function was examined. CCHFV vOTU processes human and sheep pro-ISG15s rapidly. erVV vOTU also robustly cleaves the pro-forms of hISG15 and shISG15. CCHFV vOTU has the reverse activity, preferring the pro-nsISG15 to the pro-bISG15. NSDV vOTU only fails to cleave the pro-form of fISG15, which is not cleave by any of the vOTUs assessed. CCHFV vOTU or ERVV vOTU were added to the cell. the binding stoichiometry was 1:1 between the proteases and the ISG15s. both endothermic and exothermic interactions were observed. ERVV vOTU also possessed the lowest KD for the ISG15s tested. affinity for mISG15 was significantly lower, with a KD of 7.48 0.26. this was 10-fold tighter than CCHFV vOTU's affinity for mISG15. the ISG15s were placed in the syringe at a 10-fold-higher concentration than the protease in the cell. c Binding stoichiometry. c Binding enthalpy. d Gibb's free energy. e Entropy factor. the substrate interface of ERVV vOTU is considerably more charged than that of CCHFV vOTU. the presence of this RSN motif within ERVV vOTU lines up with the thermodynamic observations that hydrophobic interactions play a more minor role in ERVV vOTU substrate binding than that of CCHFV vOTU. electrostatic surface of ERVV vOTU bound to CmISG15 (blue), with CmISG15 depicted as a ribbon, generated as for panel b. arrow indicates location of the hydrophobic binding pocket. triple mutant showed activity toward Ub-AMC similar to that of the R21V mutant, with a partial recovery of activity toward hISG15-AMC. this suggests the presence of the RSN motif is a key driver in determining a nonhuman ISG15. differences in intramolecular interactions between CmISG15 (blue) and hISG15 (green) from CCHFV vOTU-hISG15 (PDB entry 3PSE) that impact the surface potential. mISG15 has an additional hydrophobic path located around Phe97. previous structural studies on hISG15 highlighted an anionic ridge running throughout hISG15. this ridge is made up of Glu139, Glu132, Asp133, Asp133, and Asp120. this truncation occurs by the presence of mISG15 His116 in place of Gln118 in hISG15. this substitution creates a substantially different hydrogen bond network in the region than that observed in hISG15. ERVV vOTU-CmISG15 interface spans 907.9 2 and is comprised of a mix of hydrophobic, hydrogen bond, and charged mediated interactions. the most notable salt bridge is mISG15 residue Arg153 interacting with ERVV vOTU residue Glu101. the majority of the electrostatic interactions are involved in water-mediated hydrogen bonding networks. selectivity helix is weakly conserved among nairovirus vOTUs. intriguingly, alternate orientations of 3 appear to be driven by an effort to provide a hydrophobic pocket for accommodation of the well-conserved Trp121. ERVV vOTU (orange surface) and CCHFV vOTU (gray) are shown as ribbons. distances of electrostatic interactions range from 2.7 to 3.4. human (pro-hISG15), sheep (pro-shISG15), northern tree shrew (pro-nsISG15), dromedary camel (pro-cISG15), and mouse (pro-mISG15) were also included. a distant homologue of human ISG15 from jackknife fish was also included. CCHFV vOTU cleaves pro-mISG15 faster than human counterpart. ERVV vOTU appears process pro-mISG15 faster than CCHFV vOTU. there is an absence of activity of ERVV vOTU for ISG15. a 10 M concentration of each proISG15 was incubated with a 20 nM concentration of each vOTU at 37\u00b0C for at least 1 h. the binding of mISG15 was more than 20-fold weaker, with a KD of 72.00 27.10 M. ERVV vOTU possessed the lowest overall KD for the ISG15s tested. affinities of ISG15 by ITC not only parallel the results of the ISG15 protease assay but also provide quantitative insight into the substantial differences. the ISG15s were placed in the syringe at a 10-fold-higher concentration than the protease in the cell. the ISG15s were placed in the syringe at a 10-fold-higher concentration than the protease in the cell. globally, the vOTU from the ERVV adopts a familiar vOTU fold of a central seven-stranded -sheet flanked by five -helices. these elements form a cleft in which the CmISG15 substrate is bound. the substrate interface of ERVV vOTU is considerably more charged than that of CCHFV vOTU. arrow indicates location of hydrophobic binding pocket of ERVV vOTU (orange) identified from electrostatic surface. single mutants consisting of S132A, N134I, and R21V were constructed along with a triple mutant containing R21V. b-AMC was measured and compared against wild-type ERVV vOTU. the triple mutant showed activity toward Ub-AMC similar to that of the R21V mutant, with a partial recovery of activity toward hISG15-AMC. this suggests the presence of the RSN motif is a key driver in determining a vOTU's preference for Ub. Structure of CmISG15. overlay of CmISG15 (blue) with ChISG15 (green) from CCHFV vOTU-ChISG15 (PDB entry 3PHX) shown as ribbons. surface generated using adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann solver (APBS) in hISG15, a positive ridge is present starting close to its C terminus with Arg155 and continuing along Arg153, Asn151, Asn89, and Arg87, with contributions from Phe149. in contrast, this surface is broken up in mISG15 by Ile147 and His149 in lieu of hISG15's Asn151 and Phe149. similar indirect change occurs at position 148 in mISG15. this internal difference between mISG15 and hISG15 allows for a hydrogen bond to form between mISG15 residues Lys148 and Glu87. this has the impact of reorienting the position of Glu87 compared to its human counterpart Asn89 away from the surface. the third appears to serve as the basis for the sole major tertiary fold difference between CCHFV and ERVV vOTU originating in the 3-helix. this suitably named selectivity helix is weakly conserved among nairovirus vOTUs. alternate orientations of 3 appear to be driven by an effort to provide a hydrophobic pocket for accommodation of the well-conserved Trp121. ERVV vOTU (orange) and CCHFV vOTU-ChISG15 complexes are shown as ribbons. ERVV vOTU (orange) and CCHFV vOTU (gray) are shown as ribbons. ERVV vOTU includes ubiquitin binding motif, suggesting it could accommodate Ub's conical Ile44 centric hydrophobic patch. this feature is the principal obstacle to ERVV vOTU possessing deubiquitinase activity. however, recent nairovirus was isolated from giant leaf-nosed bats in 2010-2011. the ERVV vOTU-cmISG15 structure is based almost solely on water-mediated hydrogen bond interactions. the ERVV vOTU-cmISG15 structure is based almost solely on water-mediated hydrogen bond interactions. the ERVV vOTU-cmISG15 structure is based almost entirely directly on residue-to-residue interactions. CCHFV vOTU uses Glu128 to form a hydrogen bond with hISG15 Asn89. however, the ability of a comparable CCHFV vOTU-mISG15 hydrogen bond to form is doubtful. at the mISG15 position equivalent to Phe149, there too is a hydrophobic residue. conurf surface rendering of conserved residues in the lobe of human, sheep, northern tree shrew, mouse, camel, and bat ISG15s. the divergence at positions equivalent to hISG15 89, 149, and 151 is not limited to hISG15 and mISG15. nairovirus vOTUs have been shown to interact only with the C-terminal domain of ISG15, a domain that tends to be more conserved than their N-terminal lobe counterpart. a coronavirus papain-like proteases (PLpro) was recently shown to interact with the N-terminal lobe (45) deISGylase activity was largely tied to the ability of a viral protease to cleave the human variant of ISG15 attached to 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin. this has led to the classification of many viral proteases as solely deubiquitinases. this would stress that testing a wide range of ISG15s from various species will be necessary to clarify if their deISGylase is specific to specific species. ERVV was isolated from a white-tooth shrew and its vOTU is not able to cleave ISG15 originating from the northern tree shrew. this could be the result of differences in ISG15 between the white-tooth shrew and its northern tree shrew counterpart. this issue cannot be directly resolved, as there is no sequence available for the white-tooth shrew. ERVV vOTU contains a number of hydrophobic residues, Ile15, Leu19, Ile121, and Phe155, that can create a hydrophobic valley at the bottom of its ubiquitin binding motif. this feature is the principal obstacle to ERVV vOTU possessing deubiquitinase activity. a comparable electrophilic SNR motif is present within the LPHV vOTU. similar motifs may be present in other unknown nairoviruses. however, analogous motifs present in other vOTUs would suggest they are unlikely have robust deubiquitinase activity. CCHFV vOTU relies on F149 to fit into a hydrophobic pocket created by the CCHFV vOTU residue side chains of Val12 and Val18 as well as the methyl group on Thr10. at the mISG15 position equivalent to Phe149, there too is a hydrophobic residue. divergence at positions equivalent to hISG15 89, 149, and 151 appears to create a steric clash with CCHFV vOTU residue Val18. if CCHFV vOTU engage mISG15 in a manner similar to that of hISG15, the impact of these particular sites on binding could be synergistic. the level of homology among the ISG15s appears to correlate with their observed biochemical activity. the vOTUs from ERVV, CCHFV, and NSDV also appear to robustly cleave pro-shISG15. nairovirus vOTUs have been shown to interact only with the C-terminal domain of ISG15, a domain that tends to be more conserved than their N-terminal lobe counterpart. coronavirus papain-like proteases (PLpro) was recently shown to interact with the N-terminal lobe (45) this suggests that these proteases, along with other host proteins that engage the N-terminal ISG15 lobe in addition to the most nairoviruses can establish a persistent infection in ticks (46, 47) certain vertebrate hosts parasitized by ticks carrying CCHFV usually develop only transient viremia (46) deISGylase activity is conserved to evade the immune response of vertebrate hosts. NSDV appears to have the most robust activity for ISG15 originating from sheep. it can also cleave ISG15 from humans, in whom it also causes disease. this along with CCHFV vOTU's weaker affinity for mISG15 over hISG15 may suggest that there is a certain threshold of deISGylase activity needed to impact disease outcome from a vOTU perspective."}
