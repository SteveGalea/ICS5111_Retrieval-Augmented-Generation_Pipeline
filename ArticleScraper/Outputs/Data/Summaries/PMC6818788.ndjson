{"summary": "the interferon (IFN)-mediated immune response is important for the control of viral infection by the effect of downstream IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) the viral RNA is recognized by retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors. the viral DNA is detected by cytosolic DNA sensors including cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (CGAS) and AIM2-like receptors. the p200 family proteins belong to the interferon-inducible p200 family proteins (also known as PYHIN or HIN-200 proteins), which contains a pyrin (PYD) domain at the amino-terminus and at least one DNA binding HIN domain at carboxy-terminus. p200 family proteins can also act as modulators of many cellular functions, including cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, senescence and DNA repair. p200 family protein IFI204 is induced in BMDCs by MHV infection. this may prevent the host innate immune system from over-activation. this indicates that ALRs play two opposite roles during the infection. MHV infection induced a 5-fold upregulation of the mRNA of Ifi204 at 18 hpi. however, Ifi204 was not stimulated in BMDCs. similar phenomena were observed in wt BMDCs and Ifnar-/- BMDCs infected by a DNA virus (HSV-1) IFI204 inhibits RNA virus-triggered type I IFNs responses. the cells were unstimulated (US) or stimulated with SeV, poly(I:C) or ssPolyU (10 g/ml) qRT-PCR analysis of Ifnb, Ifna4 and Ifna6 in BMDCs with knockdown of IFI204 by lentivirus-mediated shIFI204. cells were unstimulated (US) or stimulated with MHV (MOI = 1) or SeV as indicated for 8 hrs. knockdown of IFI204 and double knockdown of IFI204-sTING or IFI204-cGAS significantly inhibited HSV-1-induced transcription of Ifnb to different degrees in NIH3T3 cells. qRT-PCR analysis revealed that knockdown of IFI204 and double knockdown of IFI204-sTING or IFI204-cGAS significantly inhibited HSV-1-induced transcription of Ifnb to different degrees in NIH3T3 cells. IFI204 inhibited the transcription of Ifnb and Ifna4 in the presence of IRF3. in IRF7-transfected Irf3/Irf7/ MEFs, the transcription of Ifnb and Ifna4 could only be activated by SeV infection or by the self-activating IRF7 mutant IRF7-247\u2013467. IFI204 can significantly inhibit IRF7-mediated type I IFNs responses. this inhibition event only occurs in RNA virus-infected cells. this inhibition event only occurs in RNA virus-infected cells. the Renilla expression plasmid (pRL-TK, 10 ng) was co-transfected as an internal control. 24 hrs post-transfection, cells were stimulated with SeV for 12 hrs. us treatment was used as a control. IFI204 and IRF7 were expressed and purified in vitro. GST-fused IFI204 and MBP-fused IRF7 were expressed. to confirm the interaction in vivo, the IFI204 and IRF7 were observed to co-localize in nucleus of Irf3/Irf7/ MEFs. purified GST-IFI204 or GST protein was incubated with MBP-IRF7 or MBP as indicated and pulled down with glutathione resin beads. each sample was detected by Western blotting with the indicated antibodies. 204 could reduce the phosphorylation level of IRF7 and decrease the amount of nuclear IRF7 in NIH3T3 cells. results suggest negative regulation of IRF7-mediated IFN responses by IFI204 was not due to the inhibition of the phosphorylation and nuclear import of IRF7. IRF7 with rabbit mAb against phospho-IRF7-Ser437/438 (CST D6M2I) and -actin in NIH3T3 cells infected by lentivirus-mediated shIFI204 or shNC as negative control. cells were uninfected (UI) or infected with SeV or transfected with poly(I:C) or ssPolyU as indicated for 12 or 16 hrs. arrow indicates different protein levels of IRF7 in perinuclear region. p200 family proteins possess conserved function in the inhibition of IRF7-mediated type I IFNs responses. MNDAL from mice and MNDA, IFI16, IFI16 and AIM2 from human showed a significant repression of type I IFNs response in BMDCs. knockdown of IFI205 stimulated SeV-, or poly(I:C)-induced expressions of IFNs in NIH3T3 cells. p200 family proteins, which contain conserved HIN domain, might play a negative regulation role in IRF7-mediated type I IFN signal luciferase assays for analyzing promoter activity of IFN or IFN4 in Irf3/Irf7/MEFs co-transfected with IFN or IFN4 promoter luciferase reporter plasmids. the Renilla expression plasmid (pRL-TK, 10 ng) was co-transfected as an internal control. bone marrow cells were harvested from 8-week-old mice (C57BL/6) and induced with GM-CSF for 7\u20138 days. the differential expression level of host factors was measured by analyzing the transcriptome and proteome before and after MHV infection. over 1000 genes at mRNA level and 200 at protein level were changed. BMDCs were infected by MHV (MOI = 1) and collected at 18 hpi. qRT-PCR analyses identified higher expression of Ifi204 in MHV-infected BMDCs at different time points as indicated. stimulated Sendai virus (SeV)-, poly(I:C)- or ssPolyU-induced transcription of Ifnb, Ifna4 and Ifna6 in NIH3T3 cells. stimulated Sendai virus (SeV)-, MHV- or SeV-induced transcription of Ifnb, Ifna4 and Ifna6 in BMDCs and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) nb and Ifna4 in IFI16-/- and IFI16+/+ A549 cells after stimulation with SeV, poly(I:C) (10 g/ml) or ssPolyU (10 g/ml) for 8 hrs. US, unstimulated control. data are representative of three independent experiments (mean SD in A-E) IFI204 inhibits IRF7-mediated activation of type I IFNs. RNA viruses trigger IRF3- and IRF7-mediated activation of type I IFNs. a set of host factors in both IRF3 and IRF7 signaling pathway were stimulated. IFI204 inhibited the transcriptional activation of Ifnb and Ifna4 promoters in SeV-infected IRF7-rescuing and IRF7-247-467-rescuing MEFs. ELISA analysis showed that the production of IFN was also remarkably inhibited by IFI204 in seV-infected IRF7-rescuing MEFs. however, IFI204 could still inhibit the expression of IFN induced by the self-activating qRT-PCR analysis of Ifnb and Ifna4 in Irf3/Irf7/MEFs. cells stimulated with HSV-1 (MOI = 1) or SeV for 12 hrs. unstimulated (US) treatment was used as a control. luciferase assays for analyzing promoter activity of IFN4 in HEK293T cells co-transfected with 200 ng IFN4 promoter luciferase reporter plasmid, 250 ng IFI204 and IRF7 as indicated. the unstimulated (US) treatment was used as a control. IFI204 or its 15 aa-deletion mutant IFI204 (IFI204-225\u2013239) disrupted the interaction of IFI204 with IRF7. they were co-transfected with IRF7 into Irf3/Irf7/MEFs. the interaction inhibits the type I IFN responses. cells were co-transfected with pFlag-IRF7 and pHA-IFI204 stimulated with SeV for 0 h (mock) and 6 hrs (SeV) cells were washed with PBS and harvested for immunofluorescence analysis. mice anti-HA antibody was used as primary antibody and FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was used to detect IFI204 as shown in red fluorescence. the EMSA analysis showed that IFI204 remarkably inhibits the binding of IRF7 and its promoter DNA. however, the IFI204 mutant (IFI204-225\u2013239) had significantly less inhibition on the binding of IRF7 with its specific promoter DNA. nuclear lysates were tested by western blotting using anti-IRF7 and anti-lamin b1 antibodies. levels of IRF7 was quantified by densitometry and normalized to lamin b1 protein levels. cells were washed with PBS and harvested for immunofluorescence analysis. IRF7 into Irf3/Irf7/MEFs were unstimulated (US) or stimulated by SeV. levels of Ifnb promoter DNA were quantified by densitometry. EMSA analysis of IRF7 binding with its promoter region. p200 family proteins contain conserved HIN domain of p200 family proteins. activated IRF7 would be bound with p200 family proteins, such as IFI204, IFI205 and IFI16, thus inhibiting the subsequent gene transcription. cGAS-STING DNA sensing pathway to facilitate IRF3 activation. qRT-PCR analysis of Ifnb or Ifna4 in Irf3/Irf7/ MEFs. 24 hrs post-transfection, cells were treated with SeV for 12 hrs. the regulatory function of p200 family members may involve more than one PYHIN protein. when all PYHIN proteins are knocked out, such regulation could not be observed. another possible explanation may be due to the use of different inducers (or viruses) and cell types. negative regulation of IRF7 could take place at the stage of IRF phosphorylation, nuclear translocation and binding with the promoter. IFI204 did not inhibit the phosphorylation and nuclear import of IRF7 but increase the phosphorylation level and nuclear retention of IRF7 to some degree. the over-expression and activation of TLR7 as well as the stimulation of IFN were also observed in our MHV-infection BMDCs model. p200 family protein IFI204/IFI16 is up-regulated during virus infection. sendai virus (SeV) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) were kindly provided by Dr. Hong-Bing Shu. herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) were kindly provided by Dr. Yu Liu. d pRK-Flag-IRF7 was amplified by PCR to delete nucleotides 739 to 1401 of IRF7. the other genes and the mutants of Ifi204 or Irf7 were cloned into pCAGGS or pGEX-4T-1. cell supernatants were co-transfected with 2 g LentiV2, 1.5 g psPAX2 and 1.5 g pMD2.G. supernatants were used to infect NIH3T3 cells and A549 cells. cells were infected twice to obtain higher transduction efficiency. cDNA was amplified by a fast two-step amplification program using SYBR Green Fast qPCR MasterMix.
