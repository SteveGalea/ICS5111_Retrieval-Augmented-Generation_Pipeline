{"summary": "the number of ESTs in the Genbank has reached more than 140.000. despite its importance in North Atlantic fisheries and potential use in aquaculture, relatively few gene expression examination exists for this species. qRT-PCR has made this method the dominant technique for quantification of relative mRNA levels in cells. the ideal endogenous control should be expressed at a constant level at all stages of development or between treatment groups. the ideal endogenous control should be expressed at roughly the same level as the mRNA under study. s encoding 5 commonly used housekeeping proteins plus 5 ribosomal proteins were selected for examination. two of the populations were sampled from heavily contaminated recipients. one control from an unpolluted fjord locality and one from an aquaculture facility. Gene name Function ACTB -actin Cytoskeletal structural protein EF1A Elongation factor 1 alpha Protein synthesis Ubi Ubiquitin Protein degradation GAPDH Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase Glycolytic protein RPS9 Ribosomal protein S9 Member of ribosome proteins ARP Acidic ribosomal protein Member of ribosome proteins RPL22 Ribosomal protein L22 Member of the geNorm software ranks the selected reference genes according to the determined gene-stability measure (M-value) the best two genes are ranked without distinguishing between them. in gills, Ubi and RPL37 ranked best with S9 ranking number three. ACTB and ARP-2, two genes encoding structural proteins, were ranked as the most unsuitable reference genes in liver. ribosomal protein genes ranked best in head kidney tissue, followed by Ubi. GAPDH and ACTB again were classified as the most unstable genes. NormFinder ranks best in liver tissue, followed by EF1A, ARP, RPL4, RPL37 and S9, all with almost the same expression profile stability. in liver the two structural proteins ARP-2 and ACTB were the least stable reference genes in head kidney tissue. osomal proteins and Ubi are the best candidate reference genes for normalization of qRT-PCR data. the geNorm algorithm is highly dependent on the assumption that none of the genes being analyzed are co-regulated. only in liver tissue did the genes encoding ribosomal proteins group tight together. ACTB and ARP-2 genes encoding structural proteins were ranked as the two least stable genes. bestkeeper uses a pair-wise correlation analysis of all pairs of candidate genes, and calculate the geometric mean of the best suited ones. in muscle tissue EF1A is the most stable gene. the expression of potential reference genes might be differentially regulated in fish living in strongly contaminated locations. Using PCA, Atlantic cod from the two contaminated locations did not group together. instead, in intestinal tissue individuals from the farmed population grouped together. study suggests Ubi and ARP are potential candidate reference genes in qRT-PCR examinations of relative gene expression in gill, brain, liver, head kidney, muscle and intestine tissues. authors read and approved the final manuscript."}
