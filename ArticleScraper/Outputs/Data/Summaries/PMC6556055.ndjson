{"summary": "Lung cancer remains the most common cause of cancer-related deaths. chemoprevention has been the most effective strategy for lung cancer prevention. however, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Nrf2 silencing by transfection with Nrf2 siRNA markedly decreased the expression of HO-1 and NQO-1 to diminish the reductions in B[a]P-induced ROS overproduction. findings provide new insight into the pharmacological action of H. cordata and indicate that H. cordata is a novel candidate agent for the chemoprevention of lung cancer. the correlations were analyzed by using Person analysis.
