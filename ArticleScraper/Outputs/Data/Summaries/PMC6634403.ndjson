{"summary": "PED is the most serious threat to piglets at the age of one week. a large-scale outbreak of PED in October 2010 in southern china caused more than one million mortalities of newborn piglets. a few studies have focused on the close relationship between PEDV and intestinal microorganisms. it has been reported that PEDV infection causes the gut microbial dysbiosis. the proportion of members of the phyla Fusobacteria and Verrucomicrobia was higher in PEDV-infected pigs than in healthy ones. quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used to detect PEDV in the jejunal mucosa of all the piglets. the samples were snap freezed in liquid nitrogen and stored in liquid nitrogen until analysis. the microbial genomic DNA was extracted from the samples and purified using the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen Ltd., Germany) the microbial genomic DNA was extracted from the samples and purified using the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen Ltd., Germany) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Sequences with 97% similarity were assigned to the same operational taxonomic units (OTUs) the effective tags of each sample were calculated, and the sample with the least amount of effective tags was used as the standard for homogenization. alpha and beta diversity analyses were performed using QIIME (V1.9.1) [26]. the piglets were selected from five sow stalls of the same farrowing house. piglets were divided into diarrhea and healthy groups. piglets were anaesthetized with excessive sodium pentobarbital. the qPCR for each sample was performed in triplicate. based on the test results of qPCR and the phenotype of all piglets in both groups, the samples with a CT value of 0 detected by qPCR were calculated as 40. the library was sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2500 platform and 250-bp paired-end reads were generated. effective tags from the original DNA fragments were merged using FLASH. the data were deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information\u2019s Short Read Archive with the accession no. SRP162202. ethics approval All animal experiments were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of China Agricultural University. the proportion of Proteobacteria in the infected groups was relatively high, with 24.67% and 22.79% in the cecum mucosa and contents. the percentage of Fusobacteria in the cecum mucosa and contents of infected groups was 26.71% and 33.91%, whereas that in the healthy groups was 17.85% and 9.88%. the proportion of lactobacillus in the cecal mucosa was relatively higher than that in the mucosa. the proportion of Lachnoclostridium in the mucosa was significantly higher than that in the cecal contents. tree of unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) based on weighted UniFrac distances was constructed. all samples were divided into two major clusters. the healthy group samples could be distinguished from the infected group samples. phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Fusobacteria were significantly higher in abundance in ce.MH group. the genus Butyricimonas and Parabacteroides belonging to the phylum Bacteroidetes were significantly higher in abundance. phyla accounted for more than 95% of the bacteria in each group-the Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Fusobacteria. the proportion of Firmicutes in the cecal mucosa and contents was approximately twice that of the infected groups. contents of infected groups were 26.71% and 33.91%. that in the healthy groups was 17.85% and 9.88% respectively. the proportion of Bacteroides in the four groups was approximately 10%. the unidentified genera included the unidentified genera. their relative proportion was less than that of the first 10 genera. differences in the cecal microbiota between healthy and infected groups. unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) phylogenetic tree constructed based on weighted UniFrac distance. the proportion of Bacteroidetes members was significantly different between the healthy and infected groups in the cecal mucosa. the abundance of phyla Firmicutes and Proteobacteria in Ce.MD was substantially higher due to an increase in the abundance of Lachnoclostridium and Campylobacter. the cecal microbiota had distinct cecal microbial compositions mostly belonging to phyla Fusobacteria. avirus, Coronavirus, Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia spp., Cystoisospora suis, and Strongyloides ransomi have been linked to enteritis and diarrhea in suckling piglets. the gut microbiota is relatively simple and susceptible to pathogenic bacteria [35]. a butyrate-producing bacterium Butyricum was significantly higher in abundance in ce.MH group than others. a reduction in Butyricimonas has been noted in numerous autoimmune and inflammatory diseases including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 diabetes. high diversity is considered to be a marker of mature intestinal microbiota. this is less sensitive to environmental factors and less susceptible to interference. previous studies have shown that Bacteroides and Proteobacteria play an important role in carbohydrate fermentation, polysaccharide catabolism, and amino acid and protein utilization. healthy and infected individuals were clustered into two categories by microbial functional prediction. porcine epidemic diarrhea virus causes intestinal malabsorption and vomiting. timely treatment of diarrhea and vomiting can effectively reduce mortality caused by PEDV. boxplot of relative abundance of Bacteroidetes in each group by metastat analysis (*p 0.05) the heatmap plot depicts the relative percentage of each bacterial genus within each group."}
