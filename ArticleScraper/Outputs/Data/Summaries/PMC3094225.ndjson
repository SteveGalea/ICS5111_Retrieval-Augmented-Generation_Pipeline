{"summary": "Background Seasonal respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) epidemics occur annually in temperate climates and result in significant pediatric morbidity and increased health care costs. a humanized murine anti-RSV monoclonal antibody can receive monthly doses of palivizumab during the RSV season. the cost-effectiveness of this therapy could be improved if treatment is given only during times of high RSV activity. health care facilities could forecast requirements for beds, staffing, testing, treatment, and other resources needed to care for sick children. data collected from primary children's medical center in salt Lake city from July 2001 through June 2008. Weber et al. model RSV transmission to examine how climate and social factors influence transmission in a population. they consider compartmental models using Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible. methods data primary children's medical center is a 250-bed children's hospital. it serves as a community pediatric hospital for salt Lake County, Utah. 80 percent of pediatric hospital admissions occurring in salt Lake County and 73% in the state of Utah are at PCMC. an observable seasonal epidemic start date of t0 was defined as the start of the first week of the epidemic year with at least five confirmed RSV cases. the number of days until the peak for the epidemic seasons was calculated as the midpoint day of the largest seven-day moving average window minus the epidemic season start day. the length of the epidemic season was calculated as the epidemic season end day minus the epidemic season start day. modeled the observed RSV cases using an extension of the SIR model that included individuals (c for children and a for adults) that were susceptible (Sc and Sa), exposed (Ec and Ea), infectious(Ic and Ia), infectious and subsequently detected children (D) transmission is modeled as a function of time using a cosine function to mirror the cyclic nature of epidemics. models with one parameter allowed to vary across seasons, models with two parameters allowed to vary across seasons, and a model with all parameters allowed to vary across seasons. Detection fraction (f) reflected fraction of the RSV epidemic in children under two years old that was captured in our data set. the RMSE was calculated as the square root of the sum of squared standardized errors between the observed daily cases and the fitted model. the denominator from these measures adjusted for the magnitude of the epidemic curve to avoid fitting the model mainly to the peak. n = 2555 data points, 365 days of case data for each of seven years, and k, the number of parameters estimated was 28 in the full model and 16 in each other model. the absolute values of the percent error in estimating total epidemic size were summed across seasons for comparison of models. the data included in our analyses were all positive test results from any of the testing methods during the study period. the practice of testing and test methods did not change appreciably during the study period. the data were used as daily counts by age group, under two and over two years old. epidemic refers to the period from the epidemic start date until the epidemic end date. the number of days until the peak for the epidemic seasons was calculated as the midpoint day of the largest seven-day moving average window minus the epidemic season start day. transmission parameter, L the latency period, f the under-two detection fraction, and recovery parameter. models with one parameter allowed to vary across seasons, and models with two parameters allowed to vary across seasons. this was specified as 0.1, which translates to a ten-day recovery period. a regular annual cycle is thought to vary due to weather and climate conditions. the SEIDR model captures the entire epidemic, detected and not detected. the SEIDR model captures the entire epidemic, detected and not detected. this offset parameter was estimated as a constant parameter across years. the parameters were estimated using a grid search. n = 2555 data points, 365 days of case data for each of seven years, and k, the number of parameters estimated was 28 in the full model (four parameters for seven years) and 16 in each other model (two parameters for seven years and two parameters overall) the Schwarz Criteria were calculated as: where M represents either the RSE or RMSE fit statistic. total number of children tested per epidemic year ranged from 3000 to 7000. of children tested, 81% were less than three years old and 95% were less than 11 years old. of children tested, 77% of children with positive tests were from salt Lake County. results of regression analysis using exponential growth to predict epidemic size, days to peak, and length. epidemic Weeks used for Exponential Growth Rate Epidemic Size Observed Start (t0) days Until peak Duration 1 0.30 -0.52 0.17 0.09 2 0.58 -0.63 -0.33 -0.30 3 0.62 -0.51 -0.36 -0.47 4 0.69 -0.43 -0.44 -0.58 5 0.78 -0.40 the minimum RMSE models were, in general, fitting to the tails of the epidemic and resulted in large errors in estimating epidemic size. the pattern of variation in estimates of offset from all models matched the biennial cycle variation in total epidemic size across epidemic years. the median size of the annual epidemic was 1113 cases. 98% of cases were detected between the months of October and April. larger epidemics alternated with smaller epidemics. the effective reproductive numbers ranged from 1.27 to 1.49 using a serial interval of seven days [16]. the four-week exponential growth rate exhibited a substantial positive correlation with epidemic size (r = 0.69, p = 0.08), and was negatively correlated with start day (r = -0.43, p-value = 0.33), days to peak (r = -0.44, p-value = 0.32), and length of the epidemic (r = -0.58, p-value = the saturated model was fit to seven epidemic years of observed RSV data with epidemic year-specific RSE values that ranged from 13 to 21, RMSE values that ranged from 0.40 to 0.77. the minimum RMSE models were, in general, fitting to the tails of the epidemic and resulted in large errors in estimating epidemic size. the pattern of variation in estimates of offset from all models matched the biennial cycle variation in total epidemic size across epidemic years. the variation in estimates of the transmission parameter and detection fraction did not necessarily match this cycle for all epidemic years. the biennial cycle of large, early, and short seasonal epidemics followed by smaller, later, and longer seasonal epidemics the next year observed in Utah is similar to other published studies of seasonal RSV epidemics in temperate climates. theories for this phenomenon include the existence and switching of two RSV disease strains, climate patterns, and waning immunity after infection. the model with detection fraction held constant across epidemic year fits the observed data well with the fewest parameters. the parameter estimates from this model also match the expected biennial pattern of the epidemic years."}
