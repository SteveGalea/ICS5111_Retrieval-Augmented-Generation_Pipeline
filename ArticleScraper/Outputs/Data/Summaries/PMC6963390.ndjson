{"summary": "in recent years, infection prevention and control (IPC) have become a challenge and a topic of interest for medical institutions in Korea. factors related to IPC include personnel for IPC, antimicrobial prescription rates, and participation in antimicrobial resistance monitoring. multidrug resistance is a growing threat to public health and an emerging crisis. phy5-1-6, phy7-1-9, phy9-1-10, phy2-1-20, phy9-1-10. pharmacists said they intervened in renal dosing adjustments, durations of antimicrobial use, and prescription evaluation when requested. antimicrobial selection processes to treat IDs appear to vary among physicians. the primary team showed hesitance to comply with ID recommendations due to concerns of potential misunderstanding patients or the treatment plan of the primary team. some primary team physicians felt that ID consults undermined their prescribing privileges. non-ID primary physicians adjusting doses for patients with decreased renal or hepatic function by ID physicians and pharmacists while overlooking acute changes or comorbidities. pharmacists believed pharmacists are trained to reconcile medication problems with good accessibility to drug information. lack of a financial support and reimbursement system Physicians urged hospitals to invest effectively in infection management. physicians and pharmacists recognized that most ASP (8 of 10 services) and ARP (8 of 11 services) were not implemented in the present state. despite the services unavailablity, physicians and pharmacists were willing to utilize the relevant services. ASP: antimicrobials stewardship programs. current perception of ASP Operation Professionals did not recognize ASP well. pharmacists said they intervened in renal dosing adjustments, durations of antimicrobial use and prescription evaluation when requested. pathogen-specific antimicrobial choices based on susceptibility results are common practice among ID physicians. non-ID primary teams prioritize following clinical status when prescribing antimicrobials. the primary team showed hesitance to comply with ID recommendations. the most frequently mentioned problem in ARP is the inappropriate doses of antimicrobials. inappropriate renal dosing adjustments of aminopenicillins, dosing frequency of levofloxacin, and therapeutic drug monitoring of vancomycin were also identified as problems. pharmacists were recognized as the most suitable profession to monitor drug\u2013drug and drug\u2013food interactions. microbial prescriptions before dispensing them due to labor-intense pharmacy work. nurses tend to be involved in antimicrobial management, while pharmacists have no chance to participate. doctors and pharmacists recognized that most ASP and ARP services were not implemented in the present state. pharmacists suggested implementing 9 (except 1) ASP- and 11 (all) ARP-related services in the future (Figure 1A\u2019,C\u2019 and Figure 2A\u2019,C\u2019) but only 5 in ASP and 6 in ARP services were preferred by physicians. both physicians and pharmacists agree on the need for this service. the primary team showed hesitance to comply with ID recommendations due to concerns of potential misunderstanding patients or the treatment plan of the primary team due to not following patients throughout the hospitalization. some primary team physicians felt that ID consults undermined their prescribing privileges. pharmacists believed that pharmacists are trained to reconcile medication problems with good accessibility to drug information. lack of a financial support and reimbursement system Physicians urged hospitals to invest effectively in infection management. they also complained that the government did not adequately subsidize ASP. a, b) means (the number of pharmacists who answered \u201cyes\u201d. ASP: antimicrobials stewardship programs. a, b) means (the number of pharmacists who answered \u201cyes\u201d. pharmacists suggested implementing 9 (except 1) ASP- and 11 (all) ARP-related services in the future. conflicts between ASP and non-ASP healthcare professionals constitute a barrier to the success of ASP. ASP can be defined as a process that enhances the effectiveness of treatment by sharing the decision-making stage in the treatment of ID among a multidisciplinary team of experts. the percentage of pharmacists working at medical institutions is 22.1% and 24.1% in Japan and the US, respectively, but about 11.7% in Korea [14]. there is no financial reimbursement for the professionals who perform and maintain ASP in the healthcare setting in Korea. the current lack of services physicians strongly desire can be prioritized in the further development of ASP. the study has a major limitation which is the small number of interviewees overall and in subgroups by specialty. the first step is to prioritize the services. the efforts to develop and improve ASP are ongoing in CHS, but it has hardly progressed. supplementary questions with yes/no dichotomous responses were posed to quantitatively assess the needs for ID-related services. supplementary questions with yes/no dichotomous responses were posed to quantitatively assess the needs for ID-related services. the sites had teaching capacity but minimal interdisciplinary team activity. research team included four researchers: a graduate student (PharmD), a clinical pharmacist, a clinical pharmacy faculty member (PharmD, PhD), and a pharmacy director (PhD). the pharmacy director served as an auditor for the study and did not participate in team meetings, which allowed them to provide an independent opinion throughout the audit process. questions in the gap analysis about ASP and ARP were prepared in two parts. the first part had 10 questions asking about previous and current experiences of ASP and future ASP-related needs. the second part had 11 questions about previous experience and future needs related to ARPs. administration, or method of administration Yes No Yes No e. Prescribing of medications to which the patient is allergic Yes No No g. Actual and potential adverse drug events Yes No No h. Failure to receive the full benefit of prescribed medication therapy Yes No No j. problems arising from the financial impact of medication therapy on the patient Yes No No k. Failure of the patient to adhere to the medication regimen Yes No No No IPC/ASP, infection prevention, and control programs; ARP, antimicrobial-related problems the level of service provision was considered well established if more than half of the respondents responded \u201cyes\u201d. the same criterion applied to deem future services \u201cnecessary\u201d the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Ewha Womans University. research team included four researchers: a graduate student (PharmD), a clinical pharmacist, a clinical pharmacy faculty member (PharmD, PhD), and a pharmacy director (PhD). the pharmacy director served as an auditor and did not participate in team meetings, which allowed them to provide an independent opinion throughout the audit process. questions in the gap analysis about ASP and ARPs were prepared in two parts. questions in the gap analysis about ASP and ARPs were prepared in two parts. inappropriate medication dose, dosage form, schedule, route of administration, or method of administration Yes No No e. Prescribing of medications to which the patient is allergic Yes No No g. Actual and potential adverse drug events Yes No No h. Problems arising from financial impact of medication therapy on the patient Yes No No k. Failure of the patient to adhere to the medication regimen Yes No No IPC/ASP, infection prevention, and control programs; ARP, antimicrobial-related problems. physicians working full-time, certified by the board of internal medicine, and those holding antimicrobial prescription privileges were interviewed individually because of their different roles and specialties in practice as primary vs. non-primary. participants were purposely selected via a snowball sampling strategy. the pharmacist director served as an auditor for the study and did not participate in team meetings. all team members had previous experience working in secondary general hospitals. the researchers discussed potential problems throughout the research process. questions in the gap analysis about ASP and ARP. Answer Yes/No Is the Service Preferred to Develop or Improve in the future. Answer Yes/No Is the Service Preferred to Develop or Improve in the future. data analysis Each line of the interview transcripts was numbered consecutively. the transcript is publically available at https://github.com/SandyRhie/FGI. the level of service provision was considered well established. a post-cost-avoidance analysis would be warranted in the near future. a post-cost-avoidance analysis would be warranted."}
