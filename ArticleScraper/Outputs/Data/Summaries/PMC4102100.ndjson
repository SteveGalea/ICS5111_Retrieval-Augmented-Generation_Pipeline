{"summary": "transmission of highly infectious diseases from infected patient to other patients and HCWs occurs constantly in hospitals and healthcare centres. low levels of compliance with standard precautions by this group are frequent. scopy and suctioning have also been documented to increase the risk of HCWs being infected with SARS and tuberculosis (TB) [18\u201321], while tracheal intubation has been significantly associated with risk of SARS transmission to HCWs [17]. seasonal influenza also causes outbreaks in acute-care facilities due to the high exposure rates in such settings. nasal and throat swabs tested for respiratory viral or bacterial infection. adenoviruses, human metapneumovirus (HMP), coronaviruses 229E/NL63 and OC43/HKU1, parainfluenza viruses 1, 2 and 3, influenza viruses A and B, and rhinovirus A/B by nucleic acid testing. coccus pneumoniae, mycoplasma pneumoniae, B. pertussis, Legionella spp, Chlamydophilia and haemophilus influenza type B were preheated at 95 \u00b0C for 15 min. amplification was completed at the final extension step at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. the outcomes were tested against predictor variables such as age, education, category of HCW, influenza vaccination uptake, and performance of hand washing and HRPs. a binary variable defining whether or not HCWs performed any HRPs during the study period was created and analysed with other predictor variables against incident infection during the study period. no 425 (884) 116 (116%) out of 481 HCWs performed at least one HRP. 34 (61%) out of 56, reported performing a HRP more than once during the study period. the aggregated number of days a HRP was performed was 264. confirmed pathogen (viral or bacterial) in symptomatic HCWs was 29 (95% CI 137\u2013622, P = 001), in those who performed a HRP. hand washing, influenza vaccination and use of surgical or cloth face masks did not affect the risk of infection outcomes.
