{"summary": "retrospectively assessed a cohort of 250 consecutive adult patients who received a first lung transplant at the University of Washington Medical Center between January 2007 and may 2012. clinical variables and endpoints were collected for 1 year after the most recently transplanted patient included, allowing a possible maximum duration of follow-up of 5.4 years. rejection was defined if a biopsy of lung tissue demonstrated grade A1 or B1R or higher rejection. standard treatment for acute rejection was methylprednisolone 1 g IV 3 days. antithymocyte globulin was generally used for refractory rejection. patients with both upper and lower respiratory tract specimens that were positive were categorized as having a lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) a new viral episode was defined if at least 1 month had passed after the initial positive specimen for a specific respiratory virus pathogen or if there was at least 1 test negative for the same virus. RVI was analyzed as a time-dependent step function for the entire duration of follow-up as well as for specific risk periods. the primary outcome was development of CLAD. a secondary outcome was the composite endpoint of CLAD or death. seronegative patients received chronic acyclovir prophylaxis. monitoring for viremia was done by blood quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) all patients were instructed to perform home spirometry and to notify the team if there was a 10% decrease in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) no surveillance testing in asymptomatic patients was performed. AD was defined as having a forced vital capacity (FVC) 80% of the patient's baseline best FVC in addition to meeting the criteria for BOS. if present at the time of decreased spirometric values, the patient was not considered as having CLAD. an episode of acute rejection was defined if a biopsy of lung tissue demonstrated grade A1 or B1R or higher rejection. standard treatment for acute rejection was methylprednisolone 1 g IV 3 days. antithymocyte globulin was generally used for refractory rejection. a respiratory viral episode was defined as upper (nasal swab or nasal wash) or lower (sputum, BAL) respiratory specimen positive for a respiratory virus by culture, FA, or PCR. patients with both upper and lower respiratory tract specimens that were positive were categorized as having a lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) covariates included age, type of transplantation (bilateral or single lung), acute rejection, and CMV pneumonia. RVI was analyzed as a time-dependent step function for the entire duration of follow-up as well as for specific risk periods (3 months, 6 months, and 12 months) following the diagnosis of RVI. the definition of CLAD requires documentation of a decrease in FEV1 of at least 20% for at least 3 weeks. 31 (62%) had pulmonary function test (PFT) information for at least 6 months following CLAD diagnosis. in all of these patients, the drop in FEV1 values was sustained. encies are shown for the 5 most common diseases in the cohort. all other diseases appeared in 5 or fewer patients. a Percentage is out of total number of chronic lung allograft dysfunction patients. patients had 3 episodes, and 1 had 5 episodes. d Other 7 viral episodes diagnosed by fluorescent antibody, culture, or both. association of RVI with Outcomes We analyzed the relationship between several factors and CLAD in both univariate and multivariate analyses. a higher percentage of R-CLAD patients had at least 1 preceding viral episode as compared with BOS (9/17 [52.9%] vs 12/33 [36.4%], respectively) a higher percentage of patients had at least 1 preceding viral episode as compared with BOS (9/17 [52.9%] vs 12/33 [36.4%], respectively. a first lung transplant at UWMC between January 2007 and may 2012 were included. there were no significant differences in demographics between patients with RVI and those without. there were no significant differences in demographics between patients with RVI and those without. chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD), bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) and restrictive CLAD (R-CLAD) 114 viral episodes were diagnosed in 79 patients (31.6%). atory Virus Infection Characteristic n (%) Unique patients with respiratory virus infection 79 Respiratory viral episodes 114 Lower tract infectiona 97 (85.1) Viral episodes per patient 1 50 2 25 3b 4 Respiratory virusc Rhinovirus 42 (33.9) Parainfluenza 1\u20134 21 (16.9) Coronavirus 20 (16.1) Influenza A, B 16 (12.9) Metapneumovirus 4 (3.2) Bocavirus 1 (0.8) Viral episodes with >1 virusa we also analyzed the association between gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and CLAD using 2 methods, first requiring a positive pH probe test for GERD diagnosis and second including anyone with a clinical diagnosis of GERD. no statistically significant association was seen in univariate analysis (data not shown) 114 viral episodes were diagnosed in 79 patients (31.6%). median time to first RVI was 19 weeks (IQR, 9\u201363 weeks) nine viral episodes had more than 1 virus isolated, 8 had 2 viruses. 1 had 3 viruses for a total of 124 viruses isolated. association of RVI with Outcomes We analyzed the relationship between several factors and CLAD in both univariate and multivariate analyses in a time-dependent manner. modeled periods of risk were independently associated with development of CLAD. we were also interested in whether 1 CLAD phenotype was more strongly associated with RVI than the other (R-CLAD vs BOS) a higher percentage of R-CLAD patients had at least 1 preceding viral episode as compared with BOS (9/17 [52.9%] vs 12/33 [36.4%], respectively) a large contemporary cohort of LTRs underwent symptom-guided testing for RVI using molecular diagnostic methods found high rates of RVI and an independent association between symptomatic RVI and CLAD. the association between RVI and CLAD was stronger with shorter modeled periods of risk but was also present when all follow-up time was considered. a subanalysis showed an association with high-grade BOS only for LRTI and had many of the same limitations as that of Khalifah et al [9]. a subanalysis showed an association with high-grade BOS only for LRTI and had many of the same limitations as that of Khalifah et al. RVI is relatively common in LTRs, and a significant proportion of cases detected by sensitive methods can be asymptomatic. RVI-mediated regulatory T-cell dysfunction leading to augmentation of innate, allo-, and auto-immune pathways are possible mechanistic pathways to explain a causal link between RVI and CLAD. study strongly suggests an association between symptomatic RVI and CLAD. a large, multicenter, prospective natural history study with careful virologic and clinical assessments and mechanistic studies as a logical next step."}
