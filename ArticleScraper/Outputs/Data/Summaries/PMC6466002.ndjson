{"summary": "ducks are a natural reservoir of low pathogenic avian influenza viruses. avian influenza viruses are classified as LPAI or highly pathogenic (HPAI) based on their pathogenicity in chickens. the HAs of LPAI viruses can be cleaved by transmembrane serine proteases and airway trypsin-like proteases. this limited cleavability restricts infection to certain tissues. in chickens, the H5 or H7 hemagglutinin subtypes may acquire mutations that make them more similar to those of human seasonal viruses. the spread of highly pathogenic influenza strains results from wild waterfowl migration and human movement of infected poultry. the co-evolution of mallard ducks with influenza viruses has produced unique host\u2013pathogen interactions that allow ducks to act as asymptomatic carriers of LPAI viruses. we compare these aspects between ducks and the extremely susceptible chickens to highlight potential mechanisms of disease resistance. -2,6-Gal SA receptors were present in the respiratory and intestinal tissues of all the galliformes. human H1N1 virions did not bind to duck intestinal tissues. chickens, pheasants, and quail in particular had the highest virion adherence. mallard-origin LPAI viruses shed primarily from the gastrointestinal tract of mallards. but often found in oropharangeal swabs of wood ducks, redheads and laughing gulls. low pathogenic viruses preferentially replicate in the lungs of mallard ducks versus ducks. a striking difference in HPAIV endothelial cell tropism between galliform and anseriform birds. the authors suggest that endothelium destruction in galliform birds contributes to increased hemorrhage and edema observed in those species. mallards also appear able to tolerate a certain amount of systemic HPAI replication. mute swans, greylag geese, ruddy shelducks, mandarin ducks, and mallard ducks infected with HPAI. all the swans and shelducks died and had lesions and viral antigen present in multiple organs. the dead mandarin duck had viral antigens in the brain and pancreas, but in no other tissues. 2-week-old pekin ducks had a higher mortality rate than 5-week-old pekin ducks from infection with two HPAI H5N1 viruses. surviving older ducks had fewer histological lesions and less systemic spread of the viruses in both cases. subclade 2.3.4 viruses were the most lethal to ducks at high inoculation doses. influenza viruses replicate preferentially in the intestinal tracts of ducks. they can spread systemically to organs, skeletal muscle, and central nervous system. mute swans, greylag geese, ruddy shelducks, mandarin ducks, and mallard ducks infected with HPAI. ducks of the genus Anas, geese of the genus Anser, and swans of the genus Cygnus all have relatively similar distributions of both -2,3-Gal and -2,6-Gal SA receptors in their respiratory and digestive tracts. differences in susceptibility between different duck species are not easily explained by receptor distributions or innate responses, but the mallard duck is more resistant to influenza viruses than other Anseriforme infected pekin ducks with two strains of HPAI H5N1 from the Eurasian lineage. the Vietnamese strain caused more severe disease, longer fever, and had much greater antigen accumulation in skeletal and heart muscle, organs, and the CNS. low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses replicate preferentially in the intestinal tracts of ducks. ducks appear less prone than other species to hyper-inflammation. LPAI virus infections cause virtually no pathology in ducks. excessive infiltration of cells and fluid into the submucosal tissues of the airways can compromise oxygen exchange. non-vaccinated pekin ducks infected with HPAI A/Dk/Nam Dinh (VietNam)/NCVD-88/2007 (H5N1), cagle et al. saw faster mean death times and more severe symptoms in Muscovy ducks. nitric oxide synthesis stimulated by interferon gamma (IFN-) and TNF signaling. low-pathogenic influenza viruses do not induce pro-inflammatory cytokines in duck tissues, primary duck lung cells, or peripheral blood mononuclear cells. ducks infected with HPAI H5N1 viruses had very different fates. chicken primary skeletal muscle myotubes produce more IL-6 and IL-8 than duck primary myotubes, when infected with either HPAI H5N1 or LPAI H2N3 viruses. a similar trend was observed in vitro, in chicken and duck embryonic fibroblasts or primary lung cells infected with H5N1. a subset of leukocytes called plasmacytoid dendritic cells can secrete large amounts of IFN- into the circulatory system. some evidence suggests that these circulating cells do not necessarily act as sentinels of infection but are activated secondarily and serve to amplify the immune response. the first responses to influenza in chickens and ducks are dramatically different. the genes expressed in the chickens were mostly related to T-cell and B-cell activation. the early genes expressed in ducks were all related to pathogen-associated molecular pattern recognition and interferon signaling. dpi shows that ISG expression correlates inversely with disease severity in ducks. recombinant duck IFN- was recently shown to inhibit influenza virus replication in duck fibroblasts in vivo. a single known type III interferon, IFN-, is secreted by many of the same cell types. recombinant version expressing a truncated viral non-structural protein 1 (NS1) induced interferon and replicated poorly. low pathogenicity influenza viruses do not induce significant interferon or pro-inflammatory signaling in the intestinal tract of ducks, where they replicate. chickens also mount robust IFN- responses to HPAI H5N1 infection, within 1 to 2 dpi. excessive infiltration of cells and fluid into the submucosal tissues of the airways can compromise oxygen exchange. hypoxia and respiratory distress syndrome have been implicated in severe human H5N1 infections. influenza virus studies look at the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines specifically as a proxy for inflammation in general. Mortality rates were high in mallard ducks infected experimentally with the A/duck/D4AT/Thailand/71.1/2004 (H5N1) and A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) viruses. a transient upregulation of IL1B and IL6 mRNA returned to control levels by the second or third day. the degree of inflammation in ducks depends on the viral strain. researchers compared nitric oxide production and iNOS gene expression in chickens and ducks infected with HPAI H5N1 or LPAI H2N3 viruses. they found higher NO concentrations in chicken serum and significantly higher iNOS mRNA upregulation in most tissues compared to ducks. high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines seem to correlate with symptom severity in ducks and chickens. low-pathogenic strains elicit virtually no pro-inflammatory signaling in ducks and chickens. pekin ducks infected with highly pathogenic Eurasian lineage H5N1 viruses upregulated IFNA and IFNB genes early, by 1 dpi, in lungs and spleens, by qPCR. transcriptome analysis of H5N1-infected ducks also showed a large and early interferon response underway in the lungs at 1 dpi and the induction of ISGs persistent through 3 dpi. clade 2.2.2.1 has a polybasic HA cleavage site. it caused milder disease in experimentally infected ducks compared to A/duck/India/02CA10/2011 (H5N1). the authors found upregulation of important antiviral interferon-stimulated genes in the lungs of ducks. chicken lungs, guts, and bursas infected with LPAI H9N2 are weak inducers of interferon in ducks. low-pathogenic influenza A/turkey/Italy/977/1999 (H7N1) replicated in duck embryonic fibroblasts and suppressed interferon. a recombinant version expressing a truncated viral non-structural protein 1 (NS1) induced interferon and LPAI infections induce lower interferon responses than HPAI infections. all three members share a dexD/H box RNA helicase domain that recognizes dsRNA species and a C-terminal repressor or regulatory domain that undergoes a conformational change. a subpopulation of RIG-I that resides in the nucleus during influenza infection has been identified in human cells 127. cytoplasmic RIG-I (but not MDA5) can act as an antiviral effector protein by binding to incoming IAV nucleoprotein. highest constitutive expression in healthy Muscovy ducks is in the trachea. a human patient who had a severe infection during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic was found to have a signaling and RNA-binding-deficient variant of RIG-I [83]. correlating with increased pathology, cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells and macrophages from that patient showed an elevated IL-6 and TNF- response to PR8 infection. so, chickens, without RIG-I, are predicted to be deficient in IFN- at the chicken fibroblasts produce little IFN- when infected and produce more when reconstituted with duck RIG-I. siRNA knockdown of MDA5 in chicken DF-1 cells did not impact influenza virus replication. third member of the RLR family, LGP2, may act as a positive or negative regulator of RIG-I. signal initiation involves the tandem CARDs of four activated RIG-I or MDA5 proteins nucleating a helical assembly of MAVS CARDs into filamentous structures. this is a spontaneous process, as demonstrated by the constitutive activity of isolated RIG-I or MAVS CARD domains that are free from auto-repression. duck RIG-I\u20132CARD can interact with chicken MAVS in the chicken DF-1 cell line. the duck RLR family consists of three cytoplasmic receptors: RIG-I, MDA5, and LGP2. RIG-I recognizes 5\u2032-triphosphorylated RNA \u201cpanhandle\u201d structures formed by the complementary ends of each influenza genome segment. 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthase-like protein (OASL) may stabilize oligomers with its own C-terminal ubiquitin-like domains. a unique duck TRIM gene promotes RIG-I signaling through an undefined interaction downstream of MAVS. a unique duck TRIM gene, TRIM27-L, promotes RIG-I signaling through an undefined interaction downstream of MAVS. a subpopulation of RIG-I that resides in the nucleus during influenza infection has been identified in human cells. cytoplasmic RIG-I (but not MDA5) can act as an antiviral effector protein by binding to incoming IAV nucleoprotein and delaying the first cycle of replication. chickens lack the RIG-I gene, and this almost certainly contributes to their extreme susceptibility to influenza disease [109,131]. chickens highly upregulated MDA5 and TLR7 in their lungs and yet produced higher viral titres. ducks upregulated RIG-I and restricted viral replication in their lungs. the CARD domains of duck MDA5 on their own are constitutively active and induce IFN- and ISG production in duck embryonic fibroblasts (DEFs) in vitro. chicken fibroblasts produce little IFN- when infected and produce more when reconstituted with duck RIG-I. RIG-I and MDA5 both signal via a homotypic CARD\u2013CARD interaction with the CARD domain of a signaling adaptor, mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) the mechanism of signal initiation involves the tandem CARDs of four activated RIG-I or MDA5 proteins nucleating a helical assembly of MAVS CARDs into filamentous structures. this is a spontaneous process, as demonstrated by the constitutive activity of isolated RIG duck RIG-I is 97.4% identical to mallard RIG-I at the amino acid level. it also induces IFN- signaling, and resistance to LPAI strain A/Chicken/Shanghai/010/2008 (H9N2) in transfected DF-1 cells. avian MAVS is likely signaling through IRF7. short K-63-linked polyubiquitin chains synthesized by tripartite motif-containing protein 25 (TRIM25) stabilize the RIG-I CARD domain oligomers with its own C-terminal ubiquitin-like domains. a unique duck TRIM gene promotes RIG-I signaling through an undefined interaction downstream of MAVS. TRIM25, Riplet, and RNF125 signaling is regulated by ubiquitination. three ubiquitin ligases stabilize activated RIG-I by the addition of K63-linked ubiquitin chains. TRIM25 stabilizes the RIG-I\u20132CARD: MAVS\u2013CARD helical structure by furnishing short chains of K63-linked ubiquitin molecules. TRIM25 ubiquitinates RIG-I\u20132CARD domains and amplifies MAVS signaling. mutation of two amino acids does not abolish signal amplification as long as interaction with TRIM25 is conserved. direct viral restriction by nuclear TRIM25 has yet to be demonstrated in ducks. TRIM27-L, unique to ducks, activates RIG-I-mediated interferon response. TRIM27-L strongly activates RIG-I\u20132CARD signaling in DF-1 cells. TRIM27.1 weakly opposes signaling. STING resides on the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial outer membrane. Activated STING moves to perinuclear vesicles to initiate a phosphorylation cascade. there is significant cross-talk between mammalian RIG-I and STING signaling through several indirect pathways. TRIM25, Riplet, and RNF125 signaling is regulated by ubiquitination. three ubiquitin ligases are positive regulators, stabilizing activated RIG-I. TRIM25 stabilizes the RIG-I\u20132CARD: MAVS\u2013CARD helical structure. duck TRIM25 provides anchored and unanchored polyubiquitin chains. direct viral restriction by nuclear TRIM25 has yet to be demonstrated in ducks. TRIM25 contributes to IFN- production in chicken cells during influenza virus infection. TRIM27-L activation overcame TRIM27.1 inhibition. 6.3. ZAP Zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP or ZC3HAV1) is a direct viral restrictor and a positive regulator of RIG-I signaling. Activated STING moves to perinuclear vesicles to initiate a phosphorylation cascade that leads to the nuclear translocation of IRFs [165]. there is significant cross-talk between mammalian RIG-I and STING signaling through several indirect pathways and through a direct interaction between STING and MAVS [167]. chicken STING overexpression in DF-1 cells activates IRF7 and inhibits influenza virus replication, while knockdown of STING blunts MDA5 human TLR7 is highly expressed in the endosomes of plasmacytoid dendritic cells [88], which produce the bulk of IFN- during influenza infection [175,176,177]. TLR7 and TLR8 in dendritic cells can respond to viral RNA from ruptured cells or infected cells taken up into endosomes. the TLR8 gene is disrupted in ducks, chickens, and other birds. LPAI A/turkey/Italy/977/1999 (H7N1) disrupts the TLR8 gene in ducks and chickens. TRIF TLR3 detects double-stranded RNA in endosomes and elicits an interferon response. chicken TLR3 responds to poly(I:C in vitro) and was upregulated in lung and brain tissue at 24 hpi. qPCR found TLR3 in all Muscovy duck tissues except skeletal muscle. wei et al. also infected pigeons with A/Duck/Guangdong/212/2004 (H5N1) and A/Duck/Guangdong/383/2008 (H5N1) viruses. pigeons seem to downregulate TLR3 in their lungs upon influenza infection. duck TRIF induces IFN- expression, which is impaired by point mutation of alanine 517. TRIF cannot interact with TLR3 through the TIR domain. TLR7 and TLR8 receptors recognize single stranded viral RNA. chickens upregulated TLR7 in the lungs more strongly than ducks at 16 h post-infection with H7N1. chickens upregulated TLR7 in the lungs more strongly than ducks at 16 h post-infection with H7N1. the majority of the differences between the duck and chicken TLR3 sequences lie in the cytoplasmic signaling domain, the Toll/Interleukin-1 receptor homology domain (TIR) the majority of the differences between the duck and chicken TLR3 sequences lie in the cytoplasmic signaling domain, the Toll/Interleukin-1 receptor homology domain (TIR) duck TRIF is an adaptor to TLR3 that mediates NF-B and IRF activation and apoptosis. TRIF mRNA is upregulated in duck embryonic fibroblasts stimulated with poly(I:C) or infected with AIV. overexpression of duck TRIF induces IFN- expression, which is impaired by point mutation of alanine 517. no investigation of duck NLRP3 has yet been published. no investigation of duck NLRP3 has yet been published. duck LSm14A is the RNA-binding component of processing bodies. duck NLRP3 was cloned in 2015 and found to be significantly diverged from mammalian homologues. there is also evidence that NLRP3 activation can contribute to a cytokine storm [64]. most highly upregulated transcripts in three ducks infected with HPAI A/duck/Hubei/49/2005 (H5N1) at 1 dpi, relative to mock-infected controls, were internally normalized to a housekeeping gene, hydroxymethylbilane synthase (ENSAPLT00008800), before comparison. chicken Viperin is 90% identical to the duck orthologue at the amino acid level. it is inducible by poly(I:C), several TLR ligands, and IFN- in chicken spleenocytes. an inducible and potentially functional Viperin protein exists in both chickens and ducks. dsRBD becomes activated by binding foreign dsRNA in the cytoplasm. two or more PKR proteins binding the same dsRNA molecule lead to mutual phosphorylation and activation of the protein kinase domains. PKR-knockout mice are highly susceptible to influenza-infection-induced cell death. chicken PKR mRNA was broadly distributed in all tissues of anser cygnoides geese. all but one of the PKR proteins showed antiviral activity against vesicular stomatitis virus in vitro. chemokine axis is generally considered homeostatic, continuously operating to ensure tolerance, it is greatly increased during infection. chickens also upregulate CCL19 in response to infection with avian influenza. pulmonary expression of several chemokines including CCL19 is involved in recruitment of lymphocytes and dendritic cells. a different report shows that primary viral transcription is inhibited in Mx1 (murine) stably-transfected cells, while a post-transcriptional step is inhibited in MxA (human) stably-transfected cells [233]. in ducks that have a strong IFN- response on the first day post-infection with HPAI H5N1 viruses, Mx1 mRNA is highly upregulated 1\u20133 dpi, in lung, s chickens have a single polymorphic Mx gene with variable, but mostly weak anti-influenza activity. mutations disrupting GTP binding and GTPase activity also disrupt antiviral activity of Mx. OASL in humans lacks 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthase activity. OASL activates the RNase-L pathway when bound to viral RNA. wild-type duck OASL restricted the replication of a variety of RNA viruses in vitro, including influenza virus. duck IFITM3 localizes to endosomes and blocks IAV entry into human cells. SL preferentially activates RNase-L in vivo or if it also activates the RIG-I pathway. chickens and mallard ducks infected with HPAI H5N1 had a 2-fold decrease of IFITM3 mRNA in chicken ileum. in ducks IFITM3 was upregulated 12-fold in lungs and 10-fold in ilea on the first day post-infection. the nomenclature for IFITM1 and IFITM3 in both ducks and chickens in this study is reversed compared to the current phylogenetic consensus. IFIT5 is highly upregulated in duck lungs and spleens in response to HPAI H5N1 viruses. it is composed of three domains\u2014two N-terminal dsRNA-binding domains and one C-terminal kinase domain. PKR becomes activated by binding foreign dsRNA in the cytoplasm. two or more PKR proteins binding the same dsRNA molecule lead to mutual phosphorylation and activation of the protein kinase domains. Activated PKR blocks viral replication and cell proliferation by broadly inhibiting protein translation. PKR-knockout mice are highly susceptible to influenza A virus infection. chicken PKR shares approximately 63% and 62% amino acid identity with mallard duck and goose PKR respectively. all but one of the PKR proteins showed antiviral activity against vesicular stomatitis virus in vitro. the exception was PKR from one Koshamo chicken that contained an R507Q substitution. pulmonary expression of several chemokines including CCL19 are involved in recruitment of lymphocytes and dendritic cells to establish tertiary lymphoid tissues. the consequence of CCL19 expression and recruitment of leukocytes to the infected lung tissues of birds that naturally lack lymph nodes remains an open question. humans and mice both have two Mx genes encoding two Mx proteins\u2014MxA and MxB in humans. duck Mx1 mRNA is highly upregulated 1\u20133 dpi, in lung, spleen and brain tissues. the first investigation of two duck Mx1 alleles found that they did not confer resistance to influenza infection in stably-transfected mouse and chicken cell lines. the intracellular distribution of the recombinant protein differed from the positive control mouse Mx1 [234] gene with variable, but mostly weak anti-influenza activity depends on chicken breed. mutations disrupting GTP binding and GTPase activity also disrupt antiviral activity of Mx. OASL in humans lacks 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthase activity. OASL is upregulated in the brain, lung, and spleen tissues of ducks infected with HPAI H5N1 viruses. wild-type duck OASL restricted the replication of a variety of RNA viruses in vitro, including influenza virus. duck IFITM3 shows positive selection at certain amino acids in regions implicated in influenza virus restriction. residue V30 in the N-terminal domain, also important for influenza virus restriction, was invariable in all mallard duck sequences. duck IFITM3 localized to DF-1-labelled endosomes and reduced replication of H6N2, H11N9, and H1N1 viruses by 50\u201360%. both ducks and chickens possess functional IFITM3 proteins that block influenza virus entry into cells. but ducks seem able to induce it earlier in infection, possibly thanks to RIG-I signaling. NS1 regulates viral RNA synthesis in host cells [263], controls host protein expression [264]. recombinant A/turkey/Italy/977/1999 (H7N1) with a severely truncated NS1 was able to replicate in IFN-deficient Vero cells, but not in duck embryonic fibroblasts. NS1 from strain A/Duck/Guangdong/212/2004 (H5N1) blocks Muscovy duck MDA5 signaling. u et al. [268] described a five-amino-acid internal mutation that destabilized the structure of NS1 and led to its rapid degradation in chicken cells in vitro. NS1 from avian influenza A/H5N1 bound chicken TRIM25 strongly and reduced the interferon- response in a chicken cell line. NS1 of highly-pathogenic A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) has a lower affinity than ESxV for PDZ domains. the introduction of \u2018ESEV\u2019 motif into the swine strain A/WSN/1933 (H1N1) increased virulence in infected chicken lungs without increased replication. no pathology or replication differences were seen in ducks. NS1 in ducks NS1 protein function is important for influenza viral fitness in chicken cells. recombinant A/turkey/Italy/977/1999 (H7N1) with a severely truncated NS1 was able to replicate in IFN-deficient Vero cells, but not in duck embryonic fibroblasts. it is not known whether this is achieved by blocking the duck RIG-I pathway through TRIM25. NS1 from avian influenza A/H5N1 bound chicken TRIM25 strongly and reduced the interferon- response in a chicken cell line. NS1 proteins from several mammalian strains interacted only weakly with chicken TRIM25. majority of avian influenza A viruses have NS1 proteins with a C-terminal consensus sequence ESxV. NS1 proteins are truncated at the C-terminus and have no PBM. the human RSxV motif has a lower affinity than ESxV for PDZ domains. the introduction of \u2018ESEV\u2019 sequence into the swine strain A/WSN/1933 (H1N1) increased virulence in infected chicken lungs without increased replication. duck ISG12-2 is an interferon-stimulated gene that destabilizes mitochondrial membranes in human cells to produce a pro-apoptotic effect. ducks infected with HPAI H7N1 had quicker apoptotic and CD8+ T-cell responses co-localized to viral antigen in the lungs, by 8hpi. recombinant duck USP18 suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion in duck embryonic fibroblasts. in vitro experiments with recombinant chicken USP18 showed it enhanced LPAIV, but not HPAIV, replication. duck antibodies include IgM, IgA and both a full-length and truncated IgY [290] the cause of the poorer antibody response to influenza in ducks is unknown. it may be due to the truncated IgY antibody, which would be expected to be impaired in all effector functions. ducks have an extensive repertoire of MHC class I alleles in the wild. ducks infected with HPAI H5N1 had faster apoptotic and CD8+ T-cell responses co-localized to viral antigen in the lungs, by 8hpi. duck ISG12-2 is an interferon-stimulated gene that destabilize mitochondrial membranes in human cells to produce a pro-apoptotic effect [282]. recombinant duck USP18 suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion in duck embryonic fibroblasts. overexpression of recombinant duck USP18 suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion in duck embryonic fibroblasts. duck antibody responses appear to prevent re-infection with the same strain. the cause of the poorer antibody response to influenza in ducks is unknown. it may be due to the truncated IgY antibody, which would be expected to be impaired in all effector functions. the cause of the poorer antibody response to influenza in ducks is unknown. ducks and chickens have to be inoculated with very different infectious doses of HPAI viruses because of the chickens\u2019 susceptibility to disease. the striking difference in susceptibility to HPAI virus disease between mallard ducks and chickens is primarily due to the lack of RIG-I in chickens. mallard ducks are more resistant to LPAI replication in their intestines without cost to fitness. ducks lack the RIG-I receptor, and relatively more resistant than other bird species. ducks are more resistant to disease caused by all strains of HPAIV. the host\u2013pathogen interactions of mallard ducks and influenza viruses are multifactorial and complex. the relative resistance to highly-pathogenic strains likely results from evolutionary fine-tuning."}
