{"summary": "PCR-based nucleic acid (NA) assays are the first-choice techniques for flu surveillance and diagnosis due to their rapidity, sensitivity and specificity. virus isolation is still critical for antigenic analysis and characterization of influenza virus (flu-v) [2], [2]. the demand for automated systems has grown markedly as a result of increasing PCR testing since the onset of pH1N1 [2], especially at regional clinical and public health laboratories. the risk of cross-contamination during automated processing was also assessed. a pH1N1 isolate was used as a representative human/avian flu-v. a total of 49 throat swabs were retrospectively selected for this study. pooled fecal samples Human feces were obtained from healthy subjects. fresh poultry droppings were collected from cages of live poultry in four markets. to increase heterogeneity of small samples, every three fecal samples from the same type of subject were combined into one mixture. three 100-mg feces from three individuals were added to 3 ml VTM and homogenized by shaking for 20 min. a modified protocol (Maxwell 16-M) was also employed for flu-v RNA extraction from fecal samples. purified RNA from 140-l sample was eluted in 60-l Buffer AVE (QIAGEN, Germany) t-test was used to compare detection rates between the two methods. a pH1N1 isolate was used as a representative human/avian flu-v. a total of 49 throat swabs were retrospectively selected for this study. cous phlegm were used to prepare mock-infected BALFs by mixing 100 l of the pH1N1SWL02 stock (10\u20134 dilution) with 900 l of the fecal supernatant. fecal suspensions (10%, W/V) were then centrifuged at 13000 rpm for 5 min. the remaining 31 negative BALF supernatants without viscous phlegm were used to prepare mock-infected BALFs by mixing 100 l of the pH1N1SWL02 stock (10\u20134 dilution) with 900 l of the fecal supernatant. each three fecal samples from the same type of subject were combined into one mixture. RNA extraction by this system in terms of RNA recovery from the pH1N1SWL02 stocks at high, medium and low concentrations. after an initial lysis of sample followed by transfer of the sample lysate to Maxwell 16 LEV Cartridge, the remaining purification process was fully automated by the extractor in Viral Mode. the sample input of 200 l and output of 50 l, which were designated as standard Maxwell 16 protocol (Maxwell 16-S), were chosen based on the manufacturer purified RNA from 140-l sample was eluted in 60-l Buffer AVE (QIAGEN, Germany) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. CDC flu A/B and RP primer/probe sets were applied to the detection of universal flu A and B viruses. human RNA served as an internal positive control for human RNA. dilutions of 10\u20136, 10\u20137 and 10\u20138 were chosen. an additional seven replicates of each dilution were extracted. a 10-fold dilution series of influenza virus stock (105.7 TCID50)/ml were extracted in triplicate for each dilution with the Maxwell 16-S and QIAamp kit. Sensitivity comparison Precision comparison (CV %) Intra-run Inter-run Extraction method 10\u20136 10\u20137 10\u20138 10\u20132 10\u20134 10\u20132 10\u20134 10\u20136 QIAamp 20/20a 14/20 2/20 1.05 0.62 1.42 0.81 0.42 2.09 Maxwell 16-S 20/20 4/20 1.44 1.19 1.46 1.07 1.62 1.57 a number of measurements with positive detection of flu-v. maxwell 16-S and QIAamp Kit were \u20132.13 (P0.001) for throat swabs and \u20130.95 (P = 0.001) for BALFs. all throat swabs after extraction with the two methods tested positive for flu A or B virus by RRT-PCR. the CDC Flu A/B Real-time RT-PCR and RP Real-time RT-PCR assays were performed after RNA extraction for detection of flu virus and human RNase P gene. a Ct value of 45 was used to represent a negative sample result. maxwell 16-S extracted 14 false-negative samples. 9 turned positive after a 10-fold dilution of their extracts. maxwell 16-M (100-l input and 100-l output) was adopted. CtMS is Maxwell 16-M minus Maxwell 16-S. estimated hands-on time was reduced by ca. 31 min for extraction of 6 samples and by ca. 39 min for 16 samples with the automated method compared to the manual method. the list prices (cost per extraction) of the kits for Maxwell 16 System and QIAamp method are similar in china, but the latter is much more expensive than the latter in the united states. dilutions of 10\u20136, 10\u20137 and 10\u20138 were chosen. flu-v was detected in all measurements at a dilution of 10\u20136, 15 of 20 measurements at a dilution of 10\u20137 and 2 of 20 measurements at a dilution of 10\u20138. the viral RNA was then tested by the CDC Flu A RRT-PCR. sensitivity comparison was plotted against the mean Ct values of triplicate determinations for each dilution producing repeated positive results. the effect of automated sample preparation on the precision of RRT-PCR was estimated by extracting 10\u20132, 10\u20134 and 10\u20136 dilutions. the maxwell 16-S and QIAamp method exhibited positive RP reactions by RRT-PCR with Ct values less than 37. all throat swabs after extraction with the two methods tested positive for flu A or B virus. the maxwell 16-S gave lower Ct values in 42/49 throat swabs than the QIAamp method. both the CDC Flu A/B Real-time RT-PCR and RP Real-time RT-PCR assays were performed after RNA extraction for detection of flu virus and human RNase P gene. IQR, interquartile range. Ct value difference is Maxwell 16-S minus QIAamp. * P0.05. the results indicate that more RT-PCR inhibitors were co-extracted with viral RNA by Maxwell 16-S than by QIAamp Kit, which led to more false negatives. the results indicate that more RT-PCR inhibitors were co-extracted with viral RNA by Maxwell 16-S. a Ct value of 45 was used to represent a negative sample result. IQR, interquartile range. CtSQ is Maxwell 16-M minus Maxwell 16-S. * P0.05. the list prices (cost per extraction) of the kits for Maxwell 16 System are similar in china. a magnetic particle-based automated system extracted NA more efficiently from throat swabs than a QIAamp column method. a magnetic particle-based automated system extracted NA more efficiently from throat swabs compared with the QIAamp method. a magnetic particle-based automated system extracted NA more efficiently from throat swabs compared with the QIAamp method. fecal material (feces, rectal or cloacal swabs) is an alternative matrix for detection of flu-v in poultry as well as in humans. but the fecal matrix has been recognized as a difficult and heterogeneous sample matrix for molecular analysis. samples after Maxwell 16-M extraction were improved in samples with higher inhibitor concentrations but delayed in samples with no or fewer inhibitors. the risk of cross-contamination between samples is a concern due to the full opening of reagent cartridges during automated sample processing."}
