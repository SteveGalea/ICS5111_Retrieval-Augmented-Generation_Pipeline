{"summary": "foodborne diseases are transmitted via fecal-oral routes and person-to-person contact. human norovirus (HuNoV) and hepatitis A virus (HAV) are considered to be the most important. viral persistence in various environments (e.g., marine and soil environments) and fresh foods has been reported (20, 21) oysters are known to be one of the important vehicles involved in both HuNoV and HAV outbreaks (22\u201324). the consumption of raw or uncooked oysters increases the chance of a foodborne outbreak. HAV and MNV were propagated in FRhK-4 cells and RAW 264.7 cells. FRhK-4 cells were grown to confluence and then infected with HAV for 1 h. supernatants were subjected to ultrafiltration at 5,000 g for 20 min at 4\u00b0C 15 to 20 times. supernatants were kept frozen at 70\u00b0C until use. bacteria was propagated in Escherichia coli C3000. 100 l of HAV (2 106 PFU/ml), MS2 (2 107 PFU/ml), or MNV (2 107 PFU/ml) was inoculated onto the smooth surface of the pepper samples. each sample was composed of two oysters to minimize weight differences. 15 ml of the homogenate was transferred into a conical tube. centrifugation was performed at 10,000 g for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. experiment was not performed with MNV at 70% RH due to mold contamination. we compared three survival models (linear, weibull, and biphasic models) to find the model that best fit our observed survival data. survival curves were fit to the observed data points by using SigmaPlot version 10.0. the biphasic model proposed by Kamau et al. (38) describes the inactivation of microorganisms in two fractions. the model also assumes that microorganism numbers decrease exponentially throughout the two phases and that the rate of decline of each phase is independent. 10 mM HEPES (Gibco), 10 mM sodium bicarbonate (Gibco), 10 mM minimum essential medium nonessential amino acids (Gibco) and gentamicin (50 g/liter) were grown to confluence and then infected with HAV for 1 h. supernatants were inoculated in confluent RAW 264.7 cells for 1 h and then incubated for 4 to 5 days. tryptic soy agar (TSA) (BD, Sparks, MD, USA) washed several times with phosphate-buffered saline. the suspension was collected in 0.1-ml aliquots and stored at 70\u00b0C until use. fresh peppers (Capsicum annuum) were bought from local grocery market. the midgut gland, called the region of viral bioaccumulation, was dissected from the whole oyster and immersed in 20 ml of PBS. infected food samples were placed into a temperature- and RH-controlled chamber (TH-TG-300; Jeio Tech, Daejeon, South Korea) to simulate various storage conditions, four different temperature settings (4\u00b0C, 15\u00b0C, 25\u00b0C, and 40\u00b0C) infectious viral particles were measured by plaque assay (HAV and MNV) and by single-agar-layer (MS2) methods. the cells were inoculated with 500 l of recovered virus for 1 h. plates containing HAV were incubated for 7 days at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. the linear model is a general model for explaining the inactivation of microorganisms at a constant temperature over time (35). the equation for the linear model is log10 Nt/N0 = t/D, where N0 and Nt denote the initial virus titer (PFU/ml) and the virus titer after an elapsed time (PFU/ml), respectively. log 10 N ( t ) N 0 = log 10 ( 2 f 1 + e b 1 t + 2 ( 1 f ) 1 + e b 2 t. f represents first fraction on the survival curve, b1 denotes the second fraction on the survival slope, b2 denotes the specific death rate in the second slope, and t is the exposure time (days) (39). inactivation curves of foodborne viruses on oysters at 50% RH (A) and 70% RH (B), determined by a plaque assay. each graph contains four survival curves at the following four temperatures: 4\u00b0C (), 15\u00b0C (), 25\u00b0C (), and 40\u00b0C (). there are no data for MNV at 70% RH due to mold contamination. the linear model showed the poorest fit in terms of both R2 (0.67) and RMSE (0.55). the biphasic model gave a lower mean RMSE (0.22) than did the Weibull model (0.37). the biphasic model predicted the data better than the Weibull model. the plot indicates that the biphasic model predicted the data better than did the Weibull model. a 1-log reduction of both HAV and MNV occurred at 4\u00b0C, even after 14 days. MNV showed the shortest survival duration on peppers at all temperatures compared to the other viruses. all tested viruses, particularly MNV, survived much better on oysters. three different models were applied to the observed data to assess survivability of each virus. the linear model showed the poorest fit in terms of both R2 (0.67) and RMSE (0.55). the linear model showed the poorest fit in terms of both R2 (0.67) and RMSE (0.55) the biphasic model predicted the data better than did the Weibull model. the plot indicates that the biphasic model predicted the data better than did the Weibull model. 2.8 \u2014 0.4 \u2014 25 1.6 \u2014 0.1 \u2014 40 0.1 \u2014 0.0 \u2014 a \u2014, MNV was observed at 50% RH only. we characterized the survival of HAV, MS2 and MNV on either oysters or vegetables under various environmental conditions. inactivation rates of viruses, particularly MNV, were different between oysters and peppers. the exact location of inoculation could be an important factor. HBGAs are found widely within body components such as erythrocytes, saliva, and the surfaces of epithelial cells. le Guyader et al. (47) found that HuNoV binds to oyster tissue through an A-like carbohydrate structure. Poliovirus (PV) was also shown to attach to shellfish mucus through ionic bonding. ability of virus to tolerate low pH is required for survival within hemocytes in oysters. survival of viruses on oysters decreased with rising temperatures. however, an influence of RH on viral inactivation was not strongly observed in this study, especially in oysters. this means that the natural decay of viruses on foods might not provide adequate protection from viral pathogens once contamination occurs. precautionary measures should be considered to be more efficient than efforts to reduce viral particles after contamination."}
