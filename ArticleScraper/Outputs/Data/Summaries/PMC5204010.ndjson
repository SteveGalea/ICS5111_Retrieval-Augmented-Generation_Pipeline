{"summary": "105 children (60 males and 45 females) with a median age of 29 months (range: 0-131 months) diagnosed with an ADV infection were enrolled. fever was by far the most frequent symptom, followed by respiratory (82.9%), and gastrointestinal (22.9%) symptoms. 13-17% of children hospitalized with a viral respiratory tract infection are diagnosed with an ADV infection. more cases of multiple respiratory viral infections have been diagnosed using multiplex PCR tests than were reported before using conventional antigen detection and culture methods. enrolled children were divided into two groups based on multiplex PCR test. clinical data included birth history, the presence of siblings, the presence of underlying medical conditions, duration of fever and hospitalization, presenting symptoms on admission, final diagnosis on discharge, and severity of the ADV infection. a nasopharyngeal swab was collected from children complaining of respiratory symptoms or fever without a focus. the commercially available AdvanSureTM RV real-time PCR kit was used to detect ADV, influenza A and B viruses, RSV, parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus, coronavirus, and bocavirus. s identified as significantly different between the ADV and coinfection groups in a multivariate analysis were assessed for association with coinfection. a P value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant. the medical records of children admitted to the department of pediatrics were retrospectively reviewed. a nasopharyngeal swab was collected from children complaining of respiratory symptoms or fever without a focus. a positive PCR result for ADV confirmed an ADV infection. cal variables between the two study groups were compared using a chi-square test. a P value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant. 105 children were diagnosed with an ADV infection during the study period. five (4.8%) of the children enrolled in the present study received oxygen therapy. one (1.4%) child in the ADV group and four (12.5%) children in the coinfection group received ventilator care and surfactant replacement therapy. fever and apnea developed on hospital day 25 and he received ventilator care again. bRhinovirus and human bocavirus were concurrently identified in one child. proportion of children younger than 24 months was significantly higher in the coinfection group compared with the ADV group (P 0.001, Table 2). medical conditions 5 (6.8) 8 (25.0) 5 (33.3)b 3 (42.9)c 0.020 Prematurity 5 (6.8) 6 (18.8) 3 (20.0) 3 (42.9) Bronchopulmonary dysplasia 3 (4.1) 5

period. the median age at enrollment was 29 months (range: 0-131 months), and 60 (57.1%) children were males. respiratory symptoms were the most frequent, followed by vomiting and abdominal pain. the child in the coinfection group was diagnosed during hospitalization for preterm birth and neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) he was admitted to the neonatal ICU at birth, received ventilator care and surfactant replacement therapy. fever and apnea developed on hospital day 25 and he was extubated on hospital day 36. cRhinovirus and influenza B virus were concurrently identified in one child. the proportion of children younger than 24 months was significantly higher in the coinfection group compared with the ADV group (P 0.001, Table 2). however, the duration of fever and hospitalization was not significantly different between the two groups. ity 5 (6.8) 6 (18.8) 3 (20.0) 3 (42.9) Bronchopulmonary dysplasia 3 (4.1) 5 (15.6) 2 (13.3) 3 (42.9) Congenital hypotonia 0

respiratory viral coinfection caused more LRTI and a higher need for oxygen therapy than single infection. but coinfection did not lead to mortality, and duration of fever and hospitalization was not significantly different between the two groups. respiratory viral coinfection was identified in 30.5% of the enrolled children with ADV infection. this coinfection frequency was within the reported range (9.4 - 69.6%). previous studies have reported significant association between younger age and coinfection in ADV infection. coinfection caused more LRTIs compared with ADV single infection. the oxygen supplementation duration in the coinfection group was less than 3 days. the duration of hospitalization and fever was not significantly different between the coinfection and ADV groups. respiratory viral coinfection occurred more frequently in children younger than 24 months of age compared with children aged 24 months or older. appropriate therapy prevented prolonged hospitalization and poor prognosis due to coinfection."}
