{"summary": "the peptide repertoire of a specific molecule is determined by the molecular structure accommodating so-called main anchor positions of the presented peptide. despite this polymorphism, class I molecules can be clustered into sets of molecules that bind largely overlapping peptide repertoires. class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules are made of a heavy () chain and a 2-microglobulin chain. the main binding energy is provided by the interaction of residues in position 2 and the C-terminus of the peptide. the first supertypes were described in the mid-1990's by our group. initial peptide binding studies allowed the identification of several peptides with degenerate binding capacity for the A2- [13-15], A3- [16-18] and B7-supertypes. in subsequent years, additional binding data have been published to confirm the B44- [21], A1- and A24-supertypes [22] supertypes have also been examined as a variable in studies of disease association, rates of susceptibility, and outcome [37,78-86]. the original classification proposed by Sette and Sidney [12] comprise about 100 different class I MHC alleles. over the last 10 years, substantially more binding data has been generated. in the B pocket we defined the subset of residues 9, 45, 63, 66, 67, 70, and 99 as key residues. in the F pocket, the key residues are those in positions 77, 80, 81 and 116. aliphatic Aromatic and basic A01 A24 Small, aliphatic and aromatic Aromatic and large hydrophobic A02 Small and aliphatic A03 Small and aliphatic Basic A24 Aromatic, aliphatic and hydrophobic B07 Proline Aromatic, aliphatic and hydrophobic B08 Undefined Aromatic, aliphatic and hydrophobic B27 Basic Aromatic, aliphatic, basic and hydrophobic B44 Acidic Aromatic, alipha in total, 88 different class I motifs were identified. the basis for each motif assignment is listed in Tables 3 and 4 for HLA-A and -B alleles. assay A01 A*3301 Binding assay A03 A*6601 Published motif A03 A*6601 Pool sequencing/ligand elution A03 A*6901 Pool sequencing/ligand elution A02 A*7401 Binding assay A03 Table 4.
