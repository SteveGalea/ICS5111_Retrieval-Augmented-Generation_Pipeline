{"summary": "targeting hypusination of eIF5A would likely have a more limited off-target effect than one would expect for global translation inhibition. current compounds that block hypusination that are available to develop as antivirals may cause additional off-target effects. challenges remain for this idea in establishing whether this pathway can be an antiviral target. this includes in vivo testing in relevant animal models and the development of additional small molecule inhibitors/compounds that target eIF5A."}
