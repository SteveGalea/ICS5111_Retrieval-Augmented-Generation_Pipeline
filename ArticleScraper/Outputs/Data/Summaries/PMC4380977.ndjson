{"summary": "the CDC places ebolaviruses in its highest category of potential agents of bioterrorism. in 2014 the largest known outbreak is occurring in western africa3 and has crossed international borders. there is a vital need for preventatives and/or therapeutics to protect against future natural, accidental or deliberate outbreaks. the low pH of the endosome contributes to the stability of the trimer-of-hairpins. in ebolavirus entry, the low pH of the endosome contributes to the stability of the trimer-of-hairpins. the most potent of the HIV entry inhibitors, chol-PIE12-trimer, binds to the conserved hydrophobic pockets of the HIV N-trimer and inhibits HIV entry with low picomolar potency. there are five known species of ebolavirus, four of which are pathogenic to humans. cysteine 609 is proposed to disulfide bond with GP1,76 is mutated to alanine in our constructs (red) below the Zaire N-trimer is an alignment of the sequences from the 4 additional ebolavirus species plus Marburgvirus and Cuevavirus filoviruses. we have designed and characterized peptide mimics of ebolavirus N-trimers. they are mutated to aspartate in the binding site mutants. they will be useful in a variety of drug discovery platforms to screen small molecule, antibody, and peptide libraries. eboIZN39IQ presents the full ebolavirus N-trimer as a trimeric coiled coil. the ultimate goal for an ebolavirus N-trimer mimic is to use it as a target in drug screening to identify inhibitors of ebolavirus entry. the data (open symbols) and fit (solid lines) are shown for the lowest speed. each data set was globally fit to a single ideal species. each peptide was allowed to equilibrate at each temperature for 10 min. equilibrium analysis was performed 2\u20134 times and averaged for the above table. to produce a smaller target that presents a 100% identical region of the N-trimer (across all ebolavirus species), IZm was fused to the N-terminal 21 amino acids of the N-trimer, resulting in eboIZN21. eboIZN21 is highly helical, with a slight tendency to form higher order aggregates. eboC37 binds along the entire groove of the N-trimer in the postfusion trimer-of-hairpins conformation. a shortened C-peptide (eboC24), bound to eboIZN39IQ with a dissociation constant of 300 nM, did not bind to the D3 negative control. eboIZN21 was less well behaved on an SPR surface. eboIZN21 crystallized as a symmetrical trimer in space group P321. structure reveals that eboIZN21 is a continuous trimeric coiled coil. surface renderings show that a hydrophobic pocket is collapsed in the isolated eboIZN21 structure. ebolavirus GP2 core structures containing C-peptide are shown in isolation in panels B\u2013E. residues that line the N21 groove and have significantly different rotamer conformations in the unliganded structure are shown as sticks and labeled. these residues occupy some of the equivalent space occupied by C-peptide in the liganded structures. ebolavirus GP N21 pocket is induced by ligand binding and can likely adopt various conformations depending on the specific ligand. the buried SASA at the N21 pocket/8-mer C-peptide interface is similar in the 1EBO and 2EBO structures at 393/348 and 387/325 2, respectively. phage clones are expressing native binding partners eboC37 and eboC24. the target is bound to a solid support and then the phage are incubated with the immobilized target. avidity-induced affinity boost is beneficial when screening nave phage libraries. eboC37 and eboC24 clonal phage bound to eboIZN39IQ target significantly over background. both empty beads and negative control eboIZN39IQ(D3) beads were incubated with eboIZN39IQ in solution followed by capture via magnetic streptavidin beads. ative target controls include the binding site mutant, eboIZN39IQ(D3), and magnetic beads with no target (NT). specific binding (over two orders of magnitude over background) was seen when using eboIZN21 as a target in a solid-phase eboC24 clonal phage binding assay. M13KE phage binding to eboIZN39IQ beads was significantly reduced. binding of eboC24 to eboIZN39IQ was significantly reduced. a large affinity difference for eboC24 binding to eboIZN39IQ versus eboIZN21 could be seen. eboC24-phage incubated with biotinylated N-trimer in solution. negative target controls include binding site mutants and magnetic beads with no target. error bars represent standard error across triplicate experiments. mirror-image phage display is an innovative adaptation of standard peptide phage display. it is used to identify D-peptides that bind to a target of interest25,36 (Supporting Information Fig. S5) mirror-image phage display is an innovative adaptation of standard peptide phage display. mirror-image phage display targets are limited in size to those that can be chemically synthesized. the target is chemically synthesized from D-amino acids. by the law of symmetry, these D-peptides bind the natural L-target. D-eboIZN39IQ(D3) assembled from two synthetic segments of 33 and 68 amino acids. the final peptide products were confirmed by LC/MS. the law of symmetry dictates that D-peptides will adopt the mirror-image structure of their L-counterparts. our ebolavirus N-trimer, eboIZN39IQ, provides an additional tool with which to explore the vulnerability of the prehairpin intermediate. eboIZN39IQ inhibited entry in our pseudovirus system in which ebolavirus GP is expressed on the surface of an HIV particle. eboIZN39IQ IC50s are 260 nM against ebolavirus and 5.4 M against marburgvirus. eboIZN39IQ(D3) IC50s are 8.9 M against ebolavirus and 11 M against marburgvirus. ebolavirus enters cells via endocytosis and initiates membrane fusion late in the endosomal pathway. ebolavirus enters cells via endocytosis and initiates membrane fusion late in the endosomal pathway. ebolavirus entry inhibitors will have to enter into and be active in endosomes. eboIZN39IQ presents the full ebolavirus N-trimer as a trimeric coiled coil. the resulting peptide presents the full ebolavirus N-trimer as a trimeric coiled coil. the ultimate goal for an ebolavirus N-trimer mimic is to use it as a target in drug screening. peptides were centrifuged at 18,000, 21,000, and 24,000 rpm at 4\u00b0C on a Beckman XLA. all data were globally fit to a single ideal species. an observed molecular weight of 39,762 Da was determined for an Mobs/Mcalc of 3.31. each data set was globally fit to a single ideal species. each sedimentation equilibrium analysis was performed 2\u20134 times. to produce a smaller target that presents a 100% identical region of the N-trimer, IZm was fused to the N-terminal 21 amino acids of the N-trimer, resulting in eboIZN21. eboIZN39IQ presents native conformation of the N-trimer found in the prehairpin intermediate. binding to its native C-peptide ligand binds along the entire groove of the N-trimer in the postfusion trimer-of-hairpins conformation. a shortened C-peptide (eboC24) bound to eboIZN39IQ with a dissociation constant of 300 nM. eboIZN21 crystallized as a symmetrical trimer in space group P321. structure reveals that eboIZN21 is a continuous trimeric coiled coil. surface renderings show that a hydrophobic pocket in the N21 region of the 6-helix bundle structures is collapsed in the isolated eboIZN21 structure. the IZ trimerization domain (white) and N21 region (pink) are indicated. the IZ trimerization domain (white) and N21 region (pink) are indicated. the N21 region of available ebolavirus N-trimer structures is shown in isolation in panels B\u2013E. ebolavirus GP N21 pocket is induced by ligand binding and can likely adopt various conformations depending on the specific ligand. buried SASA at the HIV gp41 pocket/8-mer C-peptide interface is similar in the 1EBO and 2EBO structures.
