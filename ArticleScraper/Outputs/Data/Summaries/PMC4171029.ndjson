{"summary": "the global market for monoclonal antibody therapies is currently $50 billion a year. however, for many indications a mAb alone is insufficient to achieve a significant and durable response. recent clinical trials on mixed mAb products include treatments for cancer,1 and for infectious diseases such as rabies, C. difficile, and botulism. many companies have attempted to address this issue by producing single antibody-like molecules that recognize multiple antigenic targets, such as bispecific or trispecific antibodies. many companies have attempted to address this issue by producing single antibody-like molecules that recognize multiple antigenic targets, such as bispecific or trispecific antibodies. the relative stability of expression levels of each component antibody in a single-batch, mixed antibody expression system remains a primary concern. random integration of the antibody expression cassette into the host cell genome can have deleterious effects on host cells. however, single site integration yields only one copy of the expression cassette per cell resulting in low expression levels. studies have shown that aAV integrates at a number of \u201chotspots\u201d throughout the genome. these spots correlate with regions of open chromatin, active genes, CpG islands, and high levels of gene expression. the rep78 plasmid (pRep78low) has been optimized to express at low levels through mutation of the promoter and Kozak sequences. this allows for the correct balance of maximal Rep78 integrase activity per cell while preventing the toxicity caused by high levels of Rep78 expression. freestyle 293-F cells were transfected with only the antibody expression plasmid with GFP in place of the heavy chain (-Rep) or co-transfected with pRep78low (+Rep) the antibody expression plasmids either contained viral ITR and p5IEE elements or lacked the viral elements (- ITR and p5IEE; pExcel GFP) p5IEE element were removed from the antibody expression vector. cells were banked and thawed, and productivity was measured for two weeks. in all cases, the AAV-based stable pools led to three- to 4-fold higher expression compared with the random integration condition. the average variability from the mean for all of the antibodies in the mix was 7.3 1.3% over the course of nine weeks. the presence of each antibody in the mix was measured both by Luminex\u00ae immunoassays and by quantitation based on CIEX HPLC antibody peak areas. ten different vials of the combined antibody cell bank were thawed at two different times. the average expression of each vial in the mix over nine weeks was similar for all thawed vials. most of the antibodies were quantified by CIEX chromatography. individual antibody expression levels varied from the mean by 5.9 0.9% over the course of the experiment. in this experiment, one antibody was observed to begin to outgrow the culture, resulting in ratio skewing beyond 9 wk. the error bars represent the standard deviation of Luminex\u00ae immunoassays. data show the percent of each antibody reactivity relative to the sum of all antibody reactivities as determined by antigen-specific Luminex\u00ae immunoassays. the error bars represent the standard deviation of Luminex\u00ae measurements of the percent of each antibody in the mixture over a 12 wk period. the bars with asterisks were cultured for six weeks. the stability of the antibodies in the mixtures was measured by multiplexed immunoassays and CIEX HPLC. the random generated cell banks were less consistent, with up to 9% variability from the mean of each antibody in the identical mix over the same time period. to confirm the reproducibility of the stability of these AAV-based ACT cultures, we thawed four more stock vials at two different times. the remarkable stability of each antibody over time (an average deviation of 3.9 0.7% from the culture mean) master cell banks are made from the ACT cultures and frozen. these cell banks will be transferred to a cGMP facility for the creation of working cell banks for scale up to production bioreactors to create the ACT product. non-viral AAV based system for generation of stable pools of antibody-expressing cells. expressing plasmid or if no Rep78 is co-transfected, only a small background percentage of cells, 1%, stably express GFP. non-viral AAV based single antibody stable pools generated as described in the Methods section. pRep78low was not co-transfected with pRep78low. individual antibody stable pools created with the ACT system were cultured for up to 17 wk. the individual stable pools were banked, thawed and equal numbers of cells from each individual stable pool were mixed together to create an ACT culture expressing all five antibodies. antibody expression from these ACT cultures remained stable for the duration of the experiments. the error bars represent the standard deviation of Luminex\u00ae measurements of the percent of each antibody in the mixture over a nine week period. the error bars represent the standard deviation of Luminex\u00ae measurements of the percent of each antibody in the mixture over a nine week period. complex ACT cultures tested our system with a more complex mix consisting of 10 different antibodies. four vials of the ACT cell bank were thawed and cultured for eight weeks. most of the antibodies were quantified by CIEX chromatography. tenth antibody (antibody J) was undetectable by CIEX chromatography. the error bars represent the average of four replicate cultures. ACT cultures generated by non-viral AAV-based expression are more stable. data shown are the percent of each antibody reactivity relative to the sum of all antibody reactivities as measured by Luminex\u00ae immunoassays. the error bars represent the standard deviation of Luminex\u00ae measurements of the percent of each antibody in the mixture over a 12 wk time course. random integration was achieved using identical vectors lacking the viral elements in the absence of co-transfection with Rep78low. two independent antibody combination banks were made for both the random and AAV-based methods. two stock vials of each of the mixes were thawed and cultured for 12 wk. ACT cultures are expanded and master cell banks are created. for commercial production, ACT technology or cell banks would be transferred to a cGMP facility for the creation of master and working cell banks. these cells are frozen as single antibody stable pools cell banks, thawed, and productivity for each stable pool is measured. the cost of an ACT increases only slightly for each additional antibody. this means even a two antibody ACT is less expensive than two mAbs developed in parallel. these early cost savings will be particularly important for the development of larger complex mixtures of antibodies and will also allow for testing of multiple preclinical combinations of antibodies. this opens the door for the widespread application of complex antibody-based therapeutics to a variety of disease processes. some cultures were monitored for up to 85 doublings with no sign of trending changes in the composition. separate thaws from banked cells produced nearly identical expression profiles, with an average of 2.8 1.5% variability from the mean expression of each antibody in replicate vials. a crucial component of the stability of the ACT expression platform is the non-viral integration of the antibody heavy and light chains. the highest expressing clonal lines are usually unstable and their expression level typically drops throughout the course of production. this level of instability may be tolerated when producing a mAb, but it is not suitable for batch production of antibody mixtures where stability of the antibody ratios is critical. a mixed stable pools approach will make possible reliable and cost-effective production of ACTs. this technology is characterized by remarkable stability over multiple cell doublings and high batch-to-batch reproducibility. antibodies preceded by secretory leader sequences Vh5\u201351 and Kappa 2\u201340*01. the vector contains the cDNA of the IGHG1*01 heavy chain constant region (IgG1 constant) pExcel is identical, but lacks the ITRs and p5IEE. single antibody stable pool generation freestyleTM 293-F suspension cells were co-transfected with an antibody expression vector (pExcel ITRp5) and a Rep78 expression vector (pRep78) for 25\u201330 d or until the cell viability was above 95%. one representative vial of cells was thawed for each antibody and cultured for two weeks to assess antibody expression and reactivity.
