{"summary": "a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was contracted by approximately 8,000 individuals during the 2002-2003 epidemic. 50% of patients greater than 60 years of age succumbed to the infection, while no patient less than 24 years old died. several species of coronaviruses with similarities to SARS-CoV have been identified in bat populations. live attenuated vaccines are considered most effective in their ability to induce a long-lived balanced immune response. the major problems of using live attenuated vaccines relate to the possibility that viruses may revert to virulence and to the risk that even attenuated live vaccines may cause disease in immunocompromised vaccine recipients. virus completely protected hamsters and partially protected mice transgenic (Tg) for the expression of the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) against challenge with SARS-CoV. human isolates of SARS-CoV, including the Urbani strain, cause no or mild disease in young or older wild-type mice. mice were kept in the animal care facility at the university of Iowa. all protocols were approved by the University of Iowa Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. mutations were introduced into the Urbani strain of SARS-CoV. titers are expressed as PFU/g of tissue for SARS-CoV. animals were anesthetized and transcardially perfused with PBS followed by zinc formalin. sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. 96-well MaxiSorp Immuno plates were coated with 2 105 PFU of formaldehyde and UV-inactivated SARS-CoV. wells were exposed to 3-fold dilutions of sera from naive or immunized mice for 1.5 h. Mutations required for mouse adaptation were introduced into the Urbani strain of SARS-CoV using a previously described bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-based reverse genetics system. mutations were introduced into Nsp5 (H133Y, K268N), Nsp9 (T67A), Nsp13 (A4V), S protein (Y436H) and M protein (E11K), resulting in rMA15 (24). single-cell suspensions were prepared using collagenase D (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) and 0.1 mg/ml DNase (Roche) to digest the lung (28, 29). cells were incubated for 5 h with brefeldin A (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) 96-well MaxiSorp Immuno plates were coated with 2 105 PFU of formaldehyde and UV-inactivated SARS-CoV. wells were exposed to 3-fold dilutions of sera from naive or immunized mice for 1.5 h. the ELISA titer was defined as the highest dilution of serum that gave a 2-fold increase over the background. mice developed no signs of clinical disease or weight loss. mice infected with the same dosage of rMA15-E succumbed to the infection. rMA15-E immunization protects 6-week-old BALB/c mice from pulmonary disease. intranasal infection of 6-week-old mice with 6,000 PFU of rMA15-E resulted in a small amount of peribronchial/perivascular inflammatory cell infiltration over the first few days following immunization. infectious virus was detected at days 2, 4, and 6 after immunization in the lungs of 6-week-old mice with 6,000 PFU of rMA15-E. rMA15-E immunization was at least as effective, with virus undetectable at day 4 after challenge. all mice in the rMA15-E-treated groups survived and showed no weight loss, while 100% of control mice died. anti-SARS-CoV neutralizing antibody titers were detectable in 7 of 9 rMA15-E-immunized mice, with an average titer of 1:95 21. rMA15-E immunization protects 12-month-old and 18-month-old mice after MA15 challenge. the kinetics of rMA15-E clearance from the lungs of 12-month-old mice was delayed compared to that of rMA15-E-immunized 6-week-old mice or rU-E-immunized 12-month-old mice. this clearance is not due to enhanced replication of rMA15-E in extrapulmonary tissues. data are combined results from 2 experiments (n = 4 to 9 mice/time point/group) mice were challenged at 21 days postimmunization with 105 PFU of MA15. data are representative of 1 of 2 independent experiments with 5 to 7 mice per group. histological examination of lungs of rU-E-immunized mice or PBS-immunized mice challenged with MA15 revealed interstitial and peribronchial inflammatory cell infiltration with edema. the lungs of infected rMA15-E-immunized mice showed minimal evidence of lung damage or cellular infiltration. rMA15-E-immunized mice showed no signs of clinical disease and minimal weight loss after immunization. mice showed no signs of clinical disease and minimal weight loss after immunization. eighteen-month-old mice were immunized with 6,000 PFU of MA15. we immunized 6-week- and 12-month-old mice with rMA15-E, rU-E, or PBS. then challenged them with 105 MA15 at 66 days after immunization. all rMA15-E-immunized mice survived subsequent infection with MA15. 12-month-old mice were immunized with 6,000 PFU of rMA15-E, rU-E, or PBS and challenged 66 days later with 105 PFU of MA15. mice were sacrificed for lung virus titers at times shown postinfection (n = 3 to 6 mice/group/time) or monitored for weight loss and survival (n = 5 mice/group) hACE2-Tg mice are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV (15, 17, 19, 20) however, this recombinant virus was constructed on the background of a human coronavirus strain that caused no disease and induced weak anti-virus T cell and antibody responses in young BALB/c mice (20. mice of all ages infected with the mouse-adapted MA15 strain develop clinical pneumonia. rMA15-E immunization protects 6-week-old BALB/c mice from pulmonary disease. intranasal immunization of 6-week-old mice with 6,000 PFU of rMA15-E resulted in a small amount of peribronchial/perivascular inflammatory cell infiltration. intranasal immunization of 6-week-old mice with 6,000 PFU of rMA15-E resulted in a small amount rMA15-E-immunized mice were challenged with 105 PFU of MA15 at day 21 postimmunization. data are representative of 2 experiments with 4 mice/group (A) or 2 experiments with 4 to 8 mice/group (B to D) rMA15-E immunization was at least as effective, with virus undetectable at day 4 after challenge. immunization with rU-E induced an anti-SARS-CoV T cell response in some but not all mice at day 7 and very low neutralizing antibody titers at day 21 (20) antiviral T cell responses were detected in 7 of 9 rMA15-E-immunized mice, with an average titer of 1:95 21. immunoization with 6,000 PFU of rMA15-E caused no clinical disease in 12-month-old mice. histological examination of immunized lungs revealed small amount of inflammatory cell infiltration at days 4 and 6 after inoculation. rMA15-E clearance from the lungs of 12-month-old mice was delayed compared to that of rMA15-E-immunized 6-week-old mice or rU-E-immunized 12-month-old 12-month-old mice were immunized with 6,000 PFU of rMA-E or rU-E. Virus titers in the lungs were determined at days 1, 2, and 4 postchallenge. data are representative of 1 of 2 independent experiments with 5 to 7 mice per group. the same dose of rMA15-E completely protected 12-month-old mice from challenge with 105 PFU of MA15. the same dose of rU-E completely protected 12-month-old mice from challenge. 1:198 51 in rMA15-E-immunized mice compared to low titers in two mice (1:61) or levels below the limit of detection in six rU-E-immunized animals at day 21 after immunization. ELISA titers were low in all mice but significantly higher in rMA15-E-immunized mice. eighteen-month-old mice were immunized with 6,000 PFU of rMA15-E or PBS. twenty-one days postimmunization, mice were challenged with 105 PFU of MA15 and monitored for weight loss and survival. data are from 2 experiments with 5 to 6 mice per group. neutralizing antibody titers were at or below the limit of detection in both age groups after immunization with rU-E. titers measured by ELISA were present at low levels in mice immunized at 6 weeks. six-week- and 12-month-old mice were immunized with rMA15-E or rU-E and challenge with MA15 at 66 days. rU-E-immunized mice showed airway necrosis and alveolar edema compared to rMA15-E-immunized mice. immunization of 6-week-old mice with a recombinant version of a human strain of SARS-CoV lacking E protein expression provided partial protection against challenge with mouse-adapted virus. rMA15-E is very attenuated, causing no clinical disease in mice of all ages. however, it will be prudent to introduce additional attenuating mutations into rMA15-E to enhance safety (2, 14) anti-virus responses are often induced against internal proteins. mutations in another nonstructural protein, Nsp14 (a 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 exonuclease), result in decreased fidelity and virus attenuation in vivo. incorporation of mutations in Nsp14 into rMA15-E would minimize the risk of reversion. deletion has multiple effects on the infected cell, potentially attenuating the infection by a variety of mechanisms. we are identifying domains of E protein responsible for its various roles in assembly, morphogenesis, and virulence."}
