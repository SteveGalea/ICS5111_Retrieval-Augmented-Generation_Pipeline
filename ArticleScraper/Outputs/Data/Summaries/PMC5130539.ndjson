{"summary": "a variety of approaches have been developed to model pediatric PH. short-term neonatal hyperoxia, fetal and/or post-natal hypoxia and a two-hit model of prenatal hypoxia followed by postnatal hyperoxia. neonatal hyperoxia may predispose adults to PH (95) a large animal model using chronically ventilated lambs also exhibits increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and pulmonary vascular remodeling (7). both rats and mice exhibit substantial increases in PPA and RV mass. inhibitors almost completely normalizes PPA (166) and vascular remodeling appears to occur in an outward manner. the model that perhaps best reflects severe human PAH combines a single dose of the VEGF receptor inhibitor SU5416 followed by exposure to hypoxia (SuHx) in rats, this model develops robust EC and PASMC proliferation and occlusive lesions reminiscent of PAH in humans (2, 234) studies from human lung biopsies and evaluation of temporal sequence of remodeling suggest medial remodeling may precede intimal remodeling in PH (242), suggesting abnormal PASMC signaling could be a potential primary locus of disease pathology. new stereological assessments of alveolar capillary network provide more accurate assessment of alveolar capillary volume. fixative and embedding protocols should be chosen carefully. adherence to published guidelines for evaluating lung structure (117) will help improve reproducibility and interpretation of results. pathways and targets The exact mechanisms governing abnormal migration and proliferation of vascular cells in PH are not fully known. uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) leads to low mitochondrial Ca2+ levels and mitochondrial hyperpolarization. mice with EC-specific deletion of BMPR2 have sustained PH following hypoxia then reoxygenation. mtDNA4977, a mitochondrial DNA deletion known to be associated with cancer (59) PD catalyzes a reaction resulting in formation of NADPH. hypoxic exposure increased G6PD activity within PASMCs. this modulated expression of smooth muscle phenotype proteins such as SM22 (44) MCs isolated from CH rats showed elevated SM22 levels that were attenuated, along with PH, in animals receiving lentivirus to reduce SM22 levels (282). however, others also observed reduced SM22 expression in hypoxic PASMCs (126), in PAs exposed to hypoxia (44), and in whole lung tissue from hypoxic rats (36). variations in culture conditions, species (rat vs. human), location in the lung from which cells were derived (proximal studies have shown RV mitochondrial and metabolic dysregulation in PH models. severe RV dysfunction was associated with a shift in metabolic substrate utilization, measured via imaging for 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoroglucose and 14-(R,S)-[18F]fluoro-6-thia-heptadecanoic acid. mitochondrial and metabolic pathways do not contribute to pressure overload. oxidative stress has also received significant attention with regards to the pathogenesis of pulmonary vascular remodeling. elevations in ROS can also be due to circulating inflammatory cells. smooth muscle-specific deletion of extracellular superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD, or SOD3) augmented CH-induced PH (CHPH) in mice, arguing for a protective role for this enzyme. PPAR expression is decreased in the pulmonary vasculature of patients with PH (10) PPAR agonism attenuates PH and pulmonary vascular remodeling in animal models. PPAR signaling results in antiproliferative effects (22). p38 kinases are members of the stress-activated kinase family. they are induced by stressors including inflammatory cytokines, osmotic changes, and mechanical deformation. p38 has been implicated in maladaptive signaling in pulmonary vasculature and RV. downregulation of BMPR2 in PASMCs is associated with upregulation of p38 (157) in pulmonary fibroblasts, activation of p38 promotes fibroblast proliferation under hypoxic conditions. p38 can also contribute to release of mitogens from the fibroblast that stimulate adjacent PASMC proliferation and recruit proinflammatory cells (200) the increase in PKC expression is likely downstream of increased angiotensin II signaling (46, 247) in cardiac fibroblasts, ANG II leads to collagen production via inactivation of p38 (46), similar to the role of reduced p38 described in LV hypertrophy (27). low levels of the AT2 antagonist PD123319 provided a similar benefit for RVH. arginase II expression, as well as that of arginase I, was increased in lung tissue from neonatal rats exposed to the chemotherapeutic agent bleomycin (97) this induces a robust inflammatory response, lung morphology resembling emphysema, and severe PH (87, 97, 123) Akt signaling in PASMC proliferation in response to hypoxia 233. loss of Akt1 prevented proliferation in vitro and development of hypoxia-induced PH. hypoxic induction of miR-17-5p, known to induce PASMC proliferation, was necessary for increased arginase II expression. E2 therapy attenuated RVH and RV function in male rats but did not impact RVSP, suggesting a cardiac-specific effect. however, in other models, female sex clearly confers susceptibility. 450 1B1 (CYP1B1) was markedly downregulated in female PAH patients (12) gene polymorphisms in CYP1B1 catalyzes estrogen to 2-hydroxy-estrogen (2-OHE) were associated with reduced disease penetrance in females with BMPR2 mutations (12). BMPR2 mutation carriers with wild-type alleles had fourfold higher disease penetrance but had diminished CYP1B1 activity. trone (E1) and estradiol (E2) can be metabolized through oxidation pathways by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A, 1B, and 3A producing 2-, 4- and 16-hydroxyestrogen (2-MeOE and 4-MeOE, respectively), which can have beneficial, antiproliferative properties. 16-OHE exerts proproliferative effects. perivascular inflammation is a common contributing factor in almost all forms of PH inflammasome activation and assembly lead to caspase-1-mediated cleavage of pro-IL-18 and pro-IL-1, leading to release of activated IL-1 and IL-18. conflicting results have been reported with IL-18 loss, with some reporting protection (164) and others finding no effect. exogenous administration of HIMF was sufficient to induce lung endothelial apoptosis in vivo. a metabolite of the 15-lipoxygenase pathway, 15-HETE, upregulates several cytokines. inhibition of 15-HETE reduced platelet aggregation and thrombosis in PBMCs. SU5416 animals showed severe PH, even in the absence of hypoxia, and augmented inflammation (235), which was determined to be due to loss of regulatory T cells. however, any future immunomodulatory approaches aimed at blocking immune cell recruitment or function will likely require highly specific targeting of individual cell populations within the lung. however, the differential contributions from macrophage subsets may represent a dynamic response to disease or injury. mice subjected to mechanical ventilation exhibit attenuated lung elastic fibers, increased collagen-1 and fewer capillaries at baseline. mechanical ventilation reduces abundance of growth factors, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) increased expression of collagens (COL4A5, COL14A1, and COL18A1), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 19 and a disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) reduced expression of MMP10, ADAM17, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP1) and TIMP3 (113). Interestingly, collagen 4A1 and 4A2 expression was reduced in ECs from PAH patients, secondary to BMPR2 down mutant mice in which collagen type 1 turnover was impaired exhibit preserved RV function in response to PH induced by SuHx. PKCII and - protein expression and p38 dephosphorylation were increased in cardiac fibroblasts from CH rats with RV fibrosis. the transient receptor potential channel V4 was necessary for hypoxic increases in TG2 activity, whereas HIF-1 was necessary for hypoxic induction of TG2 expression. TG2 catalyzes covalent crosslinking of lysine residues in the ECM, providing stability, rigidity, and protection from degradation. coupling protein 2 (UCP2) leads to low mitochondrial Ca2+ levels and mitochondrial hyperpolarization. mice with EC-specific deletion of BMPR2 have sustained PH following hypoxia then reoxygenation. mtDNA4977, a mitochondrial DNA deletion known to be associated with cancer, is associated with pulmonary vascular remodeling. hypoxic exposure increased G6PD activity within PASMCs. this modulated expression of smooth muscle phenotype proteins such as SM22 (44) hypoxia-induced increase in proliferation was found to be necessary for the rise in rat PASMC proliferation (42) SM22 downregulation was not observed in vivo in rats exposed to either CH or SuHx (42). differences in culture conditions, species, location in the lung from which cells were derived could contribute to differences observed. several studies have shown mitochondrial and metabolic dysregulation in PH models. severe RV dysfunction was associated with a shift in metabolic substrate utilization. the results were consistent with data in patients indicating increased glucose uptake. mitochondrial and metabolic pathways do not contribute to the response to pressure overload. oxidative stress has also received significant attention with regards to pathogenesis of pulmonary vascular remodeling. elevations in fetal vascular function can also be due to circulating inflammatory cells. smooth muscle-specific deletion of extracellular superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD), the primary defender against elevations of ROS originating in the extracellular space, augmented CH-induced PH (CHPH) PPAR expression is decreased in the pulmonary vasculature of patients with PH (10) PPAR agonism attenuates PH and pulmonary vascular remodeling in animal models. PPAR signaling results in antiproliferative effects (22) and is mediated by a number of pathways important to PH. p38 kinases are members of the stress-activated kinase family. they are induced by stressors including inflammatory cytokines. p38 has been implicated in maladaptive signaling in pulmonary vasculature and RV. p38 has been found to function as a downstream effector of BMPR2 signaling. activation of p38 promotes fibroblast proliferation under hypoxic conditions. in pulmonary fibroblasts, activation of p38 promotes fibroblast proliferation. in vivo inhibition of p38 attenuated PH, as well as reduced lung and circulating levels of IL-6. ANG II leads to collagen production via inactivation of p38 (46), similar to the role of reduced p38 described in LV hypertrophy (27). low levels of the AT2 antagonist PD123319 provided a similar benefit for RVH, and reduced influx of inflammatory cells into the lung (255). arginase II expression, as well as that of arginase I, was increased in lung tissue from neonatal rats exposed to the chemotherapeutic agent bleomycin (97) this induces a robust inflammatory response, lung morphology resembling emphysema, and severe PH (87, 97, 123) the Akt family contains three isoforms, and the use of mice with deficiency for Akt1 or Akt2 revealed that loss of Akt1 prevented hypoxia-induced proliferation in vitro and development of hypoxia-induced PH. hypoxic induction of miR-17-5p, which is known to induce PASMC proliferation, was necessary for increased arginase II expression. proapoptotic signaling, metabolic dysfunction, and proinflammatory cytokine expression (82). Interestingly, E2 therapy attenuated RVH and RV function in male rats but did not impact RVSP, suggesting a cardiac-specific effect. however, in other models, female sex clearly confers susceptibility. gene polymorphisms in CYP1B1, which catalyzes estrogen to 2-hydroxy-estrogen (2-OHE) were associated with reduced disease penetrance in females with BMPR2 mutations (12) BMPR2 mutation carriers with wild-type alleles had fourfold higher disease penetrance but had diminished CYP1B1 activity and produced lower levels of 2-OHE. further evidence that altering the balance between 2-OHE/16-OHE1 with increased 16- 2-OHE and 4-OHE derivatives can be converted to 2- and 4-methoxyestrogen metabolites (2-MeOE and 4-MeOE, respectively), which can have beneficial, antiproliferative properties. 16-OHE exerts proproliferative effects; perivascular inflammation is a common contributing factor in almost all forms of PH. inflammasome activation and assembly lead to caspase-1-mediated cleavage of pro-IL-18 and pro-IL-1, leading to the release of activated IL-1 and IL-18. conflicting results have been reported with IL-18 loss, with some reporting protection (164) and others finding no effect. exogenous administration of HIMF was sufficient to induce lung endothelial apoptosis in vivo. this action of HIMF was dependent on IL-4 (273) suggesting that vascular inflammation in the context of PH may require both endogenous activators of EC apoptosis as well as immune cell cytokine responses. a metabolite of the 15-lipoxygenase pathway, 15-HETE, upregulates several these animals showed severe PH, even in the absence of hypoxia, and augmented inflammation (235), which was determined to be due to loss of regulatory T cells. however, any future immunomodulatory approaches aimed at blocking immune cell recruitment or function will likely require highly specific targeting of individual cells within the lung. mice subjected to mechanical ventilation exhibit attenuated lung elastic fibers, increased collagen-1 and fewer capillaries at baseline. mechanical ventilation reduces abundance of growth factors, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and causes apoptosis. collagen 4A1 and 4A2 expression was reduced in ECs from PAH patients. the mechanisms regulating collagen turnover and deposition during PH are still being defined. the mechanisms regulating collagen turnover and deposition during PH are still being defined. mice with RV fibrosis exhibit increased RV fibrosis, collagen deposition and procollagen expression. mice in which collagen type 1 turnover was impaired exhibit preserved RV function in response to PH induced by SuHx. TG2 activation represents one downstream avenue via which Ca2+ fluxes effect changes in PASMC function in the setting of hypoxia. TG2 has recently been suggested to be responsive to mechanical stress (119) and, when activated, can facilitate arterial stiffening (207) and narrowing of mesenteric arteries. TB receptors did not prevent the effects of hypoxia, suggesting a potential intracellular role for ET-1 or signaling via a non-ETA or ETB receptor. blockade of either receptor prevented the ET-1-mediated effects of hypoxia (184, 265) a role for SMC-derived ET-1 in modulating PASMC function has been shown previously, where ET-1 mediated the effects of hypoxia on ion channel expression via upregulation of HIF-1. this is in contrast to other studies, which found blockade of either receptor prevented the effects of hypoxia. macitentan entered clinical trials before being tested in preclinical PH models. it is now known that macitentan is effective at reversing established PH in suHx (137) and monocrotaline (236) models. in both cases proliferation of cells in occlusive lesions was decreased. with early treatment, apoptosis was increased (221) KV7 activator reduced PPA in rats exposed to short-term (5 days) hypoxia. hypoxia downregulates KV7.5 and upregulates miR190. cGMP pathway has long been recognized that impaired NO production and/or responsiveness can contribute to PH. loss of eNOS (71, 227) or PKG isoform 1 (PKG-1) (284) increases PPA under control conditions. alternative splicing of the gene encoding PKG-1 results in two isoforms. oxidant stress can lead to reduced phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser 1177. rogen with tyrosine kinase inhibiting and anti-oxidant properties restored eNOS phosphorylation, NO production, and cGMP levels. antenatal therapy with simvastatin in a CDH model restored NOS levels, normalized pulmonary vessel density and diameter and reduced arteriolar remodeling. sGC expression appears to be upregulated during PH (211), suggesting that reduced activity may reflect oxidation and reduced NO responsiveness of the enzyme (202). sGC activity targets heme-lacking sGC when the heme iron is in its oxidized state or missing (202). riociguat improved patient outcomes (88) and has now been approved for the treatment of group 1 and group 4 PH. metformin has been found to prevent PH induced by either monocrotaline or CH (5). metformin had several effects on SuHx lungs, including increased AMPK activity, decreased aromatase and estrogen levels and decreased PASMC proliferation. a clinical trial of metformin in Group 1 PH is now ongoing (NCT01884051) a pharmacologic Nrf2 activator, bardoxolone methyl, is currently in a phase 2 clinical trial. p38 inhibitors have been marked by poor side-effect profiles. however, there has been interest in targeting other components of the MAPK signaling cascade. dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), a steroid hormone, exhibited protective effects in preclinical models of PH (9, 25, 64) low levels of DHEA are associated with the development of PAH in men (246) the serine elastase inhibitor elafin is endogenously produced in the epithelium and provides protection from inflammatory damage. elafin inhibited TG2 activity (84), suggesting additional cross-over with pathways known to be involved in PH. clinical trials have been performed or are currently underway in coronary artery bypass graft surgery (6). decreased production of NO and reduced sGC activity may all facilitate reduced effectiveness of the NO pathway to maintain low vasomotor tone. loss of eNOS (71, 227) or PKG isoform 1 (PKG-1) (284) increases PPA under control conditions. inhaled NO has been used widely in the clinical setting. in infants, inhaled NO has been used widely in the clinical setting. antenatal therapy with simvastatin restored NOS levels, normalized pulmonary vessel density and diameter. sildenafil and tadalafil have been used to increase cGMP levels. the beneficial effect of exercise training were similar to results reported in PH patients. sGC expression appears to be upregulated during PH (211) -aminolevulinic acid targets heme-lacking sGC by allowing protoporphyrin IX to bind to the heme site. also stimulating sGC with novel compound BAY 63\u20132521 (riociguat) rat model of metabolic syndrome with PH associated with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (PH-HFpEF) treatment with metformin at the time of SU5416 injection prevented increased PPA and vascular remodeling. however, there was no benefit of metformin therapy in older rats with established PH-HFpEF. Nrf2 is known to act in a PAEC signaling pathway. BMPR2 regulates TFAM and mitochondrial DNA replication. p38 inhibitors have been marked by poor side-effect profiles. gene loss of MAPK phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) in mice resulted in exaggerated increases in RVSP, RVH, and vascular remodeling in response to CH. despite potential for targeting MAPK signaling as a treatment option, it seems likely distal parts of the signaling cascades, rather than more proximal, will provide better therapeutic options. clinical trials of DHEA in PH patients are ongoing, although encouraging results from an initial pilot study of patients with PH secondary to COPD reported beneficial effects on PPA, PVR, and 6-min walk distance (65). other studies have been launched to investigate hormone therapy in PAH. circulating ET-1 and BNP/NH2-terminal-proBNP have proven useful in certain cases. circulating ET-1 levels only represent \u201cspillover\u201d rather than local concentrations. circulating ET-1 levels only represent \u201cspillover\u201d rather than local concentrations. circulating biomarkers of collagen metabolism have been shown to predict disease severity in PAH patients. high circulating levels of collagen XVIII and its cleavage product, endostatin, have also been shown to be positively correlated with poor outcomes in PAH. PH remains a complex and mysterious disease with often fatal outcome. progress has been made over the last few years in elucidating novel cellular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of disease, developing new therapeutic strategies to treat the patient population. no conflicts of interest, financial or otherwise, are declared by author. authors approved final version of manuscript."}
