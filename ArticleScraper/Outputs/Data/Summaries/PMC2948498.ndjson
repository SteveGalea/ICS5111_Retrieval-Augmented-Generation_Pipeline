{"summary": "all mild as well as critically ill cases were admitted and treated in the government hospitals during the initial phase of the pandemic. in india, all mild as well as critically ill cases were admitted and treated in the government hospitals during the initial phase of the pandemic. mexico was the first country to be affected in early March with reports of mild respiratory infection as well as severe pneumonia cases and considerable mortality [1], [2]. a 14 year-old girl without history of known risk factors succumbed to p-H1N1-09 infection in Pune, western India representing the first fatality from the country. patients confirmed to have p-H1N1-09 infection by a real time PCR test. 15 patients admitted to Intensive Care Unit and requiring mechanical ventilator support. 26 patients suffering from mild respiratory symptoms were admitted to a designated hospital. plasma layer was removed and stored at 80\u00b0C in aliquots. cell pellets were stored in 500 l RNALater solution (Ambion) at 80\u00b0C. ELISA for IgG-anti-p-H1N1 antibodies and isotyping. anti-human antibodies for TLR 2, 3, 4 and 9 (eBioscience, USA) and TLR 7 and 8 (Imgenex, USA) were used for staining. 100 l of whole blood was fully lysed with BD FACS lysis solution. s were gated and data analysis was done using BD FACSDivasoftware. cDNAs were mixed with equal volumes of TaqMan 2X PCR master mix from one-step RT-PCR kit. cDNAs were loaded per port of the TaqMan Low Density Array card (TLDA) of the human Immune panel. cDNAs from six healthy individuals processed similarly were considered as calibrators. cDNAs from six healthy individuals processed similarly were considered as calibrators. patients and clinical specimens Ethical clearance for the study was obtained from, \u2018Institutional Human Ethical Committee\u2019. for minors and critically ill patients it was obtained from parent/guardian. patients confirmed to have p-H1N1-09 infection by a positive real time PCR test. an aliquot was mixed in 13 proportions with the RNAlater. plasma layer was removed and stored at 80\u00b0C in aliquots. cell pellets were stored in 500 l RNALater solution (Ambion) at 80\u00b0C. ELISA was carried out by coating wells with purified recombinant HA protein. anti-human antibodies for TLR 2, 3, 4 and 9 were used for staining. 100 l of whole blood was fully lysed with BD FACS lysis solution. RNA was extracted from PBMCs and lung aspirates using Ribopure Kit (Ambion) as per manufacturer's instructions. RNA was eluted in 100 l elution buffer. cDNAs were mixed with equal volumes of TaqMan 2X PCR master mix from one-step RT-PCR kit (Applied Biosystems) and 125 ng (RNA equivalent) cDNAs were loaded per port of the TaqMan Low Density Array card (TLDA) of the human Immune panel. cDNAs from six healthy individuals processed similarly were considered as calibrators. results All the 26 mild cases (Male: Female ratio 1214, age range 6\u201351 yrs) had fever/history of fever in last 3 days. other symptoms included sore throat/cough (14/26), nasal discharge (6/24), headache/bodyache (5/26), diarrhea (2/26) and breathlessness (4/26). radiological findings showed that all the fatal cases had 3/6 lung zonal involvement and required ventilator assistance. RNA log10 copies/ml were determined by HA gene based real-time PCR assay. Y-axis represents different patients and samples obtained days post admission of the sequential samples of respective patients. the overall pattern reflects pandemic-H1N1-09 influenza infection. the disease severity correlated with significant increase in IL1RA, IL2 and IL6 levels in critically ill patients.

PBMCs from six healthy individuals were taken as controls. values for eighty-seven genes were hierarchically clustered on log2 transformation. corresponding gene of each cluster is listed by a gene symbol on the right-hand side. a separate cluster analysis was carried out for the sequential PBMC samples of critically ill patients. samples from S1, S2, S3 and S4 formed a single cluster (cluster 1) showing significant downregulation of most of the immune function genes. cluster 2 contained all sequential samples from the seasonal flu case (S21) and one pH1N1 case (S7). RNA log10 copies/ml were determined by HA gene based real-time PCR assay. Y-axis represents different patients and samples obtained days post admission of the sequential samples of respective patients. TLR levels were determined separately by either surface staining or intracellular staining of the cells using TLR specific antibodies followed by FACS analysis. a representative sample each from different categories showed no difference in the levels of IFN, IL12p70 and IL2RA were significantly lower in mild cases and higher in critically ill patients. 0.48 (0.48\u20131.06) 0.3697 0.0000 0.70 (0.70\u20134.41) 0.0000 Undetected 0.48 (0.48\u20130.48) IL17 0.48 (0.70\u20132.14) 0.2608 0.0002 0.18 (0.08\u20131.62) 0.0000 0.70 (0.70\u20130.61) 0.48 (0.48\u20131.07) Anti-inflammatory Cytokines IL1RA 1.23 (0.70\u20133.20) 0.0220 0.0000 0.82 (0. a* p values between critically ill patients and healthy controls.
