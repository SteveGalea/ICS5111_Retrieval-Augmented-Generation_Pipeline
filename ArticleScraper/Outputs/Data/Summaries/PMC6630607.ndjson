{"summary": "the need for rapid and large scale vaccine production during epidemics against emerging pathogens is a major challenge in vaccine development. effective vaccines for antigenically diverse and versatile pathogens that successfully subvert host immunity such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and malaria are a major challenge. an alternative approach to improve transfection efficiency includes formulation of DNA with liposomes or nanoparticles. some of the challenges in the use of nanoparticles with DNA include encapsulation inefficiency, endocytosis by target cells and toxicity [23]. the ability of a DNA vaccine to elicit T cell immunity is thus dependent on activating APCs to present antigen. the ability of a DNA vaccine to elicit T cell immunity is thus dependent on activating APCs to present antigen. a majority of the studies on experimental DNA vaccines with genetic adjuvants have been studied in animal models such as mice. a majority of the studies on experimental DNA vaccines with genetic adjuvants have been studied in animal models.

Vaccination with a DNA vaccine encoding secreted HIV Tat (TPA-Tat IMX313) induced higher humoral and cellular responses and improved protection against ecoHIV challenge in mice. a phase I clinical trial of tuberculosis vaccine evaluated the vaccine to be safe and immunogenic, but cellular (Ag85A-specific IFN-) and humoral (MVA-specific IgG) responses were not significant [85]. VSVG expression was driven by a weaker SV40 promoter and NS3 by a stronger CMV promoter [57], but others have also reported an increase in the specific CMI when the immunogen and VSVG were expressed from different plasmids [37,87]. a novel DNA technology has been developed. coding the protein of interest as an immunogen is inserted downstream of the SV40 promoter and the gene encoding a truncated version of mouse PRF downstream of the SV40 promoter. the SV40 is a weaker promoter compared to CMV and has been shown to result in 10-fold lower protein expression in transfected HEK293T cells in vitro. cytolytic DNA platform where expression of immunogen is driven by a stronger promoter allows for sufficient antigen expression and accumulation within the target cells followed by nonapoptotic cell death due to lesser expression of PRF driven by a weaker SV40 promoter. expression of PRF from a cytolytic DNA, e.g., NS3 PRF vaccine, thus results in necrotic cell death mediated by receptor-interacting protein-1 kinase activity. a significant increase in CD11c+ DCs and cross-presenting CD8a+ DCs has been reported in mice vaccinated with a cytolytic DNA HIV 1 Gag PRF compared to a canonical DNA vaccine. a cytolytic DNA vaccine has an inbuilt adjuvant to enhance the immunogenicity of the vaccine immunogen. rDNA-PRF technology has been used in the development of HIV and HCV DNA Vaccines. a caveat is that vaccine-encoded antigens need to accumulate significantly inside the cell before necrosis occurs following expression of truncated PRF to activate DCs to cross-present vaccine-encoded antigens. this study showed that PRF coexpression induced cell death by necrosis, and thus enhanced NS3-specific immune responses. proapoptotic NSP4 reduced NS3-specific response. a multi-antigenic HCV DNA vaccine encoding PRF induced robust CMI against the range of HCV NS proteins, compared to coexpression with VSVG [57]. expression of PRF from a cytolytic DNA, e.g., NS3 PRF vaccine, thus results in necrotic cell death mediated by receptor-interacting protein-1 kinase activity. a significant increase in CD11c+ DCs and cross-presenting CD8a+ DCs, and upregulation of CD86 has been reported in mice vaccinated with a cytolytic DNA HIV 1 Ga. antigen cross-presentation by DCs to CD8+ T cells has been shown to increase the number of proliferating CD8+ T cells by 2-fold with cytolytic DNA compared to the noncytolytic PRF DNA. a cytolytic DNA vaccine has an inbuilt adjuvant to enhance the immunogenicity of the vaccine immunogen. rDNA-PRF technology has been used in the development of HIV and HCV DNA Vaccines. rDNA-PRF technology has been used in the development of HIV and HCV DNA Vaccines. HCV NS3 PRF was more immunogenic than the canonical NS3 vaccine in pigs. multi-antigenic and multigenotypic DNA vaccines encoding PRF can significantly increase the magnitude and breadth of CMI responses against both genotypes. these challenges include ineffective delivery and poor uptake of DNA. gen. cytolytic DNA vaccines encoding nonstructural proteins of HCV have been tested to enhance immunogenicity of vaccine antigen in mice. increased immunogenicity and improved protection against ecoHIV challenge in mice with HIV Gag PRF [60] demonstrate the effectiveness of cytolytic DNA vaccines."}
