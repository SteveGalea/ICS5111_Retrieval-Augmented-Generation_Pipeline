{"summary": "coinfection is one of the main killers in the world, behind only cardiovascular diseases. in most scientific and medical investigations, these causal agents are studied in isolation. the immune state of the infected host is largely assumed to be a blank slate, when this is often not the case. of the 25 percent of deaths caused by infectious diseases, acute respiratory infections (for the majority, influenza and pneumonia) constitute 30 percent. death by influenza virus actually occurs due to the onset of bacterial pneumonia. bacterial pneumonia can migrate down the respiratory tract and expand in new bacterially nave niches. virally infected cells produce cytokines, host proteins secreted for intercellular communication. receiving cells are shown to increase expression of bacterial-sensing PRRs such as the NOD proteins, allowing for amplified immune responses seen in coinfection. otitis media is especially common in small children and usually caused by bacterial S. pneumoniae or H. influenzae following coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), or adenoviral infection [5,20]. otitis media can often be a concurrent polymicrobial infection [21]. a common feature seen soon after clearance of initial infection is the suppression of toll-like receptor signaling, also seen post-influenza infection. HIV is a systemic viral infection that infects and destroys both innate and adaptive immune cells. Upon exposure, HIV virus infects both T cells and macrophages at different stages of the infection, leading to a net loss in both of these immune defense cell types. tuberculosis, caused by bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), has seen a recent rise in global infection rates predominantly due to concurrent infection with HIV [30] patients who previously have been infected by asymptomatic Mtb can now see a reawakening of infection due to weakened immune state from HIV. of the 25 percent of deaths caused by infectious diseases, acute respiratory infections constitute 30 percent. death by influenza virus actually occurs due to the onset of bacterial pneumonia. these bacteria, upon weakening of host defenses by influenza, can migrate down the respiratory tract and expand in new bacterially nave niches. virally infected cells produce cytokines, host proteins secreted for intercellular communication. receiving cells are shown to increase expression of bacterial-sensing PRRs. it is typical in concurrent coinfection that combined infection is amplified often in pathogen amount and immune response. otitis media can often be a concurrent polymicrobial infection. differences in secondary bacterial infection versus concurrent. this includes altered cytokine expression patterns in vivo. HIV is a systemic viral infection that infects and destroys both innate and adaptive immune cells [25] Upon exposure, HIV virus infects both T cells and macrophages at different stages of the infection, leading to a net loss in both of these immune defense cell types. rculosis, caused by bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), has seen a recent rise in global infection rates predominantly due to concurrent infection with HIV [30] patients who previously have been infected by asymptomatic Mtb can now see a reawakening of infection due to weakened immune state from HIV. a secondary infection entering into an environment already inflamed with increased cytokine levels and an ongoing adaptive response may activate a different collection of virulence genes. this type of difference is seen in complicating cases of tuberculosis secondary to HIV infection, in which Mtb can spread to extra-pulmonary sites. vivo studies may not even be possible when we do not know how infection is established, relevant hosts may not be available for study, agents may not be infectious for common laboratory animals. additional research is starting and should be continued in the settings of more complicated polymicrobial infections."}
