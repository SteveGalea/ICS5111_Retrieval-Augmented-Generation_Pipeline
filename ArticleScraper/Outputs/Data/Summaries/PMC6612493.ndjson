{"summary": "experimental animals Anti-FCoV antibody-negative seven specific pathogen free (SPF) cats aged 5\u20136 months were used. the cats were maintained in a temperature-controlled isolated facility. a total of 100 l of the dilution was pipetted into each well of a 96-well flat-bottomed plate. the plates were allowed to stand overnight at 4\u00b0C, washed with PBS containing 0.02% Tween-20, and 100 l of the test serum sample was added to each well. the substrate solution was prepared by dissolving o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride at a concentration of 0.4 mg/ml in 0.1 M citric acid and 0.2 M Na2HPO4 buffer (pH 4.8) the reaction was stopped with 3 N H2SO4 solution and the optical density (O.D. at 492 nm was determined. feline alveolar macrophages were maintained in RPMI 1640 growth medium. they were supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 U of penicillin per ml, 100 g of streptomycin per ml, and 50 M 2-mercaptoethanol. IgG alone and virus suspension alone were added to feline alveolar macrophages. the cats were maintained in a temperature-controlled isolated facility. all experiments were approved by the president of kitasato university. a total of 100 l of the dilution was pipetted into each well of a 96-well flat-bottomed plate. the plates were allowed to stand overnight at 4\u00b0C, washed with PBS containing 0.02% Tween-20. 100 l of the dilution was added to each well and plates were incubated at 25\u00b0C for 20 min. cDNA was amplified by PCR using primers specific for the FCoV N gene (positions 876\u2013895, 5\u2032-CAACTGGGGAGATGAACCTT-3\u2032); antisense primer, positions 1644\u20131663, 5\u2032-GGTAGCATTTGGCAGCGTTA-3\u2032). the reaction was stopped with 3 N H2SO4 solution and the optical density (O.D. at 492 nm was determined. alveolar macrophages were maintained in RPMI 1640 growth medium. they were supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 U of penicillin per ml, 100 g of streptomycin per ml, and 50 M 2-mercaptoethanol. cats were euthanized at 15 and 18 day of post FIPV infection. cats inoculated orally with FIPV-I KU-2 without passive immunization did not develop clinical symptoms. the survival rate of cats with passive immunization was lower than that of the cats without passive immunization. the average survival time after infection with FIPV-I KU-2 was shorter. the ELISA OD value was continuously increased in 2 cats excluding 2 cats developed FIP (Ab2 and Ab4; Fig. 2C) in cats without passive immunization, the FCoV N gene was detected day 15 after virus inoculation in ab3. however, FCoV N gene was not detected in any samples of other cats. ADE infection with FIPV-I KU-2 was performed in feline macrophages. no FCoV N protein was detected in 3.9 2.5% of cells. in macrophages treated with both purified IgG and FIPV-I KU-2, FCoV N protein was detected in 3.9 2.5% of cells. DISCUSSION Cats orally infected with FIPV-I KU-2 do not develop FIP. the biotype (phenotype) of the orally inoculated FIPV-I KU-2 is classified as FECV. cats with or without passive immunization of anti-FIPV-I KU-2 antibodies develop FIP. inoculation routes result in differential patterns of virus shedding in cats. but even FIPV not causing FIP through oral infection may cause FIP in cats. we were able to demonstrate that infection of FIPV-I KU-2 was enhanced by anti-FIPV-I KU-2 IgG."}
