{"summary": "the 5\u2032 two-thirds of the genome consists of two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs 1a and 1b) that encode a non-structural polyprotein, including RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) the other third of the genome consists of ORFs encoding structural proteins, spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E) and the nucleocapsid (N) feline coV (FCoV) is classified into genus Alphacoronavirus, species Alphacoronavirus 1. it includes canine CoV (CCoV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine respiratory CoV (PRCoV) FCoV induces mild intestinal inflammation in kittens. CCoV like-CCoV was designated type I CCoV and reference CCoV was designated type II CCoV. in type IIb CCoV, the 5\u2032-terminal region of the S gene was similar to that of TGEV. a modified Eagle's medium contains 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 g/ml streptomycin. type I and II FCoV strains, excluding Tokyo/cat/130627, were characterized by indirect fluorescence assay (IFA) using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that were provided by Dr. Hohdatsu [11], [33]. RNA sequences of Tokyo/cat/130627 were obtained from FIP ascites in a cat in 2013. fc00-016 and fc00-087 were isolated in 2000 in Japan. a Serum was collected from the cat that was inoculated intraperitoneally with type II FCoV M91-267. each virus, excluding Tokyo/cat/130627, was inoculated onto an fcwf-4 cell monolayer and was incubated until cytopathic effects were observed. RNA was then extracted from fcwf-4 cells using an RNeasy Mini kit (Qi. RT reaction was carried out at 30\u00b0C for 10 min, 42\u00b0C for 30 min, 70\u00b0C for 15 min and 5\u00b0C for 5 min. PCR was carried out at 94\u00b0C for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 55\u00b0C for 30 s, 72\u00b0C for 2 min and final extension at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. RNA was reverse-transcribed with oligo dT-Adaptor primer. extracted RNA was reverse-transcribed with a TaKaRa RNA LA PCR kit. PCR products were directly cloned into pGEM-T Easy. RT-PCR was carried out using a QIAGEN OneStep RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. products were purified by ethanol precipitation and analyzed using an ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer. phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbor-joining method [41] based on nucleotide pairwise distance. for construction of the phylogenetic tree, we referred to the following sequences. sera from cats sera collected from two SPF cats were used. one cat was inoculated intra-orally with type I FCoV C3663. another cat was inoculated intraperitoneally with type II FCoV M91-267. when clinical symptoms were severe, cats were euthanized under anesthesia. Viruses Type I FCoV strains C3663 and Yayoi, type II FCoV strains M91-267, KUK-H/L and Tokyo/cat/130627 and type II CCoV strains fc1, fc4, fc7, fc9, fc76, fc76, fc100, fc94-039, fc97-022, fc00-089 and fc00 RNA sequences of Tokyo/cat/130627 were obtained from FIP ascites in a cat in 2013. fc00-016 and fc00-087 were isolated in 2000 in Japan. a serum was collected from the cat that was inoculated intraperitoneally with type II FCoV M91-267. each virus, excluding Tokyo/cat/130627, was inoculated onto an fcwf-4 cell monolayer and was incubated until cytopathic effects were observed.

PCR products were directly cloned into pGEM-T Easy. RT-PCR was carried out using a QIAGEN OneStep RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. products were purified by ethanol precipitation and analyzed using an ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer. phylogenetic trees were deposited to the DNA database of Japan (DDBJ) under the accession numbers listed in Table 1. phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbor-joining method. sera from cats sera collected from two SPF cats experimentally inoculated with FIPVs were used. one cat was inoculated intra-orally with type I FCoV C3663 (3.9106 PFU/cat) and showed an effusive form of FIP. when clinical symptoms were severe, cats were euthanized under anesthesia. I and II FCoVs nucleotide sequences of the 3\u2032-region of the genomes were compared with those of type II CCoV fc1 (8,959b) and type II FCoVs, M91-267 (8,889b), KUK-H/L (8,930b) and Tokyo/cat/130627 (8,831b), were determined. compared with C3663, Tokyo/cat/130627 showed a 25- in ORF M, the identities among type I FCoV, type II FCoV and CCoV were neither high nor low (Table S2, S3). comparison between Tokyo/cat/130627 and type I FCoV showed low identities in ORF S and high identities in ORFs 3a, 3c, E, M, N, 7a and 7b. FCoVs, C3663, KUK-H/L and Tokyo/cat/130627 showed higher identity in RdRp than M91-267. the sequence of RdRp of M91-267 was more similar to that of type II CCoV fc1 than type I FCoV C3663. Phylogenetic analysis using partial S genes showed that all type II FCoVs were more similar to type II CCoV than type I FCoV. also, Japanese type II FCoVs were more similar to type II CCoV than type II CCoVs and type II CCoVs from other countries. CCoVs formed one cluster with Taiwanese strain NTU336/F/2008. similarity of Tokyo/cat/130627 to CCoV fc1 changed at the 3\u2032-terminal region of the S gene, and those of M91-267 and KUK-H/L changed within the M gene. two conserved regions were located at 133\u2013177 and 325\u2013366 in the M gene. KUK-H/L was similar to type II CCoV upstream of the first conserved region. on the other hand, M91-267 was similar to type I FCoV downstream of the region. upstream of the conserved region, Tokyo/cat/130627 was more similar to type II CCoV fc1 than type I FCoV C3663. downstream of the conserved region, Tokyo/cat/130627 was more similar to type I FCoV C3663. cross-neutralization activity of sera from cats experimentally infected with FCoV was examined. type II FCoVs, M91-267 and Tokyo/cat/130627 possessed a truncated ORF 3c gene. compared with C3663, Tokyo/cat/130627 showed a 25-nucleotide deletion in the ORF 3c gene, resulting in a truncated ORF 3c gene. type II CCoV fc1 showed high identity only in ORF S and low identities in ORF 3a, 3c, E, M, N, 7a and 7b (Table S2, S3) Schema of feline and canine coronaviruses. Arrowheads indicate location of primers for amplification of partial RdRp, partial S and full N genes. type I FCoVs, type II FCoVs and type II CCoVs are shown in red, green and blue. Phylogenetic analysis using partial RdRp genes showed that Japanese type II strains could be divided into two different groups; feline CoV and canine CoV. Japanese type II FCoVs M91-267, KUK-H/L and Tokyo/cat/130627 belonged to different clusters. the similarity of Tokyo/cat/130627 to CCoV fc1 changed at the 3\u2032-terminal region of the S gene, and those of M91-267 and KUK-H/L changed within the M gene. similarity between nucleotide sequences of 3\u2032-region of genome of type II CCoV fc1, type I FCoV Black, and type II FCoVs KUK-H/L, M91-267 and Tokyo/cat/130627. similarity of 1.0 indicates 100% identity with the nucleotide sequence. two regions in squares are conserved regions among type II CCoV fc1, type II FCoVs M91-267, KUK-H/L and Tokyo/cat/130627 and type I FCoV C3663. square indicates conserved region; dots indicate the same sequences with type II CCoV fc1. cat serum against type I FCoV was able to neutralize infection of type I FCoV strains C3663 and Yayoi (16400 and 12000, respectively) but not those of type II CCoV and type II FCoV (less than 110) Discussion Type II FCoV emerged as a result of recombination events between type I FCoV and type II CCoV. two of three stains of type II FCoV, M91-267 and Tokyo/cat/130627, possessed the truncated ORF 3c gene. an intact 3c gene is apparently essential for efficient replication of FCoV in the intestinal tract, resulting in the secretion of FCoV from feces. the N protein of FCoV, but not CCoV, may be essential for replication of FCoV in cats. if the M or N genes of type I FCoV are not necessary for growth of FCoV in cats, other recombinant type II FCoVs using these possible recombination sites must occur. recombination events occurred between type I FCoV and type II CCoV. original viruses of foreign type II FCoVs, 79-1146, 79-1683 and NTU156/P/2007 differed from those of these three types. the recombination event between type I FCoV and type II CCoV occurred inside the cat body. type II FCoV emerges by homologous recombination. diseased cats do not spread type II FCoV. 6 amino acid sequence identities of N protein among type II CCoV and types I and II FCoV."}
