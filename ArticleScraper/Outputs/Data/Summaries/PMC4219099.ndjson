{"summary": "a human H10N8 infection case was first described in china on 30 November 2013. the origin and genetic diversity of this novel virus is similar to that of H7N9 virus. study data suggest that animal workers may have been infected with the virus before the first recognized H10N8 human infection cases. it seems prudent to continue surveillance for H10N8 viruses among animal workers."}
