{"summary": "cytokines now count over 50 members that orchestrate cellular communication in an autocrine, juxtacrine, and paracrine fashion through binding to distinct families of receptors. the fate of the response triggered by binding of cytokines to their cognate receptor is determined by the specific combinatorial usage of only seven different signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins. RF9 suggests their segregation in distinct complexes. the canonical type I and type III IFN signaling leads to the formation of the classical ISGF3 complex composed of STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9. FN is a pleiotropic cytokine with potent antiproliferative, antiviral and host innate and adaptive immune regulatory functions. the binding of IFN to its receptor (IFNAR) is well characterized to engage a cascade of signaling events initiated by the rapid activation of the Tyk2 and JAK1 members of JAK kinases. phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 induces their heterodimerization and association with I a large majority of type I IFN-induced gene expression is attributable to the activation of the canonical ISGF3. however, its sole activation cannot completely explain the pleiotropic biological effects of type I IFNs. phosphorylation precedes Ser708 phosphorylation. this suggests the order of STAT1 phosphorylation during the course of IFN stimulation could be an important contributor to the kinetics of ISG expression. STAT1 knockout mice are resistant to dengue virus infection. the function of STAT2 and IRF9 beyond ISGF3 has long been underestimated. a fundamental difference in the role of STAT1 vs. STAT2 and IRF9 was further strengthened by the report that lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV infection) is nonlethal. IFN-mediated induction of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) A-to-I editing enzyme encoding gene was shown to be JAK1- and STAT2-dependent. but independent of STAT1.32 Analysis of apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme-catalytic polypeptide-like 3G gene expression has recently highlighted cell type and stimulus specificity in the involvement of STAT1 in the regulation of target genes IRF9 regulates the transcription of the retinoic acid-induced gene G (RIG-G) gene in response to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) through a STAT1-independent mechanism. however, it remains to be determined whether the alternative IRF9/STAT2 pathway is involved in this regulation. the most intuitive mechanism of synergy, referred to as \u201cindependent action\u201d, consists in the induction of two independent signaling cascades that ultimately lead to a synergistic outcome. a second mechanism, referred to as \u201ccooperative action\u201d, results in the enhanced expression of a shared gene that is expressed, although to a lower extent, by single cytokine stimulation. replication of Vaccinia and Tanapox poxviruses was only partially inhibited. replication of Vaccinia and Tanapox poxviruses was only partially inhibited. resulting delayed antiviral response includes induction of the expression of the DUOX2 NADPH oxidase that ultimately produces extracellular H2O2. synergistic action of IFN and TNF engages a non-canonical STAT2 and IRF9-dependent, but STAT1-independent, signaling pathway. this pathway triggers the delayed expression of an alternative ISG panel and, at least in airway epithelial cells, of the DUOX2/DUOXA2 genes. AT2 at Tyr690 over an extended period of time compared with IFN stimulation. it was concluded that Tyk2 kinase activity was essential to mediate STAT2 phosphorylation in this non-canonical pathway. previous reports have demonstrated activation of JAK kinases. induced signal was found to synergize with NFB through an uncharacterized mechanism to trigger the expression of genes, such as the CXCL10 and CXCL9. overexpression of the super repressor (IB2N4) failed to block IFN/TNF-induced DUOX2 expression, suggesting that NFB is not involved in the \u201ccooperative induction\u201d synergism. synergism of IFN and TNF induces CXCL10 and CXCL9 by a \u201ccooperative action\u201d type of synergism. this synergy is mediated via the enhanced recruitment of the transcriptional coactivator CBP and of the RNA polymerase II to the promoters. formation of ISGF3-like complexes containing phophorylated STAT2, phosphorylated STAT6 and IRF9 was observed in IFN-stimulated hepatoma cells. a hybrid protein consisting of IRF9 fused to the C-terminal TAD of STAT2 was targeted to endogenous ISGF3 target loci. the first analysis of the capacity of STAT2/IRF9 to bind DNA independently of STAT1 revealed only limited DNA-binding affinity for the typical ISRE sequence targeted by the ISGF3 complex. to date, no specific DNA-binding consensus sequence for the non-canonical STAT2/IRF9 complex(es) has been reported. the role of STAT2 and IRF9 in regulation of specific transcriptional programs is not restricted to their involvement in the classical ISGF3 complex. it will be of high interest to depict the upstream mechanisms allowing the segregation of STAT2 and IRF9 in distinct complexes. biochemical analyses of the components of the various complexes will also be required to pave the way to the characterization of their regulatory mechanisms."}
