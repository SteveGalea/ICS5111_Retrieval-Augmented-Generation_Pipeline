{"summary": "eukaryotic circular Rep-encoding ssDNA viruses were only known in agricultural and medical fields since they are known plant (Geminiviridae and Nanoviridae) and vertebrate (Circoviridae) pathogens. metagenomics has uncovered many novel viral types and extended the environmental distribution of known viral groups. novel CRESS-DNA viruses have also been discovered from fecal samples of a variety of vertebrates. notably, CRESS-DNA viruses similar to circoviruses have now been identified in a myriad of invertebrates, including insects. well-studied viruses from the Circoviridae, Nanoviridae, and Geminiviridae families demonstrate the rapid evolutionary potential of CRESS-DNA viruses. CRESS-DNA viruses are characterized by small genomes (1.7\u20133 kb) that contain 2\u20136 protein-encoding genes. circo-like viruses have been identified from both vertebrates. similarities to circoviruses are mainly based on the Rep. the second major ORF in novel circo-like CRESS-DNA viruses does not have any significant matches in the database. smaller viral genomes, such as those of CRESS-DNA viruses, contain a higher proportion of predicted disordered residues than larger viruses. the presence of similar patterns of predicted disorder may provide one line of evidence for these proteins representing putative Caps. CRESS-DNA viruses were investigated in a variety of marine invertebrate species that were collected as samples of opportunity. whole organisms or tissue sections were serially rinsed three times using sterile SM Buffer [0.1 M NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgSO4] Genome1 Organism Tissue type Genome (bp) Genomic architecture Nonanucleotide2 Cap3 Rep P. diogenes Giant Hermit Crab aCV(I0004A) Petrochirus diogenes Abdomen 1815 Type II TAGTATTAC X X Aiptasia sp.

Since the Nanoviridae and Geminiviridae are also CRESS-DNA viral families that are evolutionarily related to the Circoviridae. select representatives of these families were included in the phylogenetic analysis. a total of 27 CRESS-DNA genomes were recovered from 21 marine invertebrates. most of the recovered genomes (66.7%) were identified from Crustacea. most of the recovered genomes were identified from the order Decapoda. the majority of the CRESS-DNA viruses detected in marine invertebrates were most similar to viral sequences identified through metagenomic surveys of marine samples. however, one of genomes, Lytechinus variegatus variable sea urchin associated circular virus_I0021, was most similar to plant viruses from the Geminiviridae family. twenty-one of the 27 recovered Reps contained all six conserved RCR and helicase motifs. most of the sequences from marine invertebrate associated viruses detected here are more closely related to circo-like viruses recovered through metagenomic surveys. ten of the 21 Reps form a well-supported clade that also includes sequences detected in the Gulf of Mexico. Reps identified from this study within the Marine Clade 1 are in red font. description of acronyms and matrix used to generate heatmap can be found in Supplementary Tables S2 and S3 respectively. most of the matches in the database were to putative CRESS-DNA viral Caps detected through metagenomic surveys. the majority of metagenomic CRESS-DNA viruses reported from marine invertebrates in this study and in GenBank are most similar to previously described circoviruses. Type B Caps show an enrichment of disorder promoting residues between residue positions 26 through 75. there is a depletion of predicted order promoting residues in this region compared to residues 1\u201325 and 76\u2013125. the percentage of predicted disordered and ordered residues does not add to 100% due to the presence of residues that are not considered disordered or ordered (i.e., H, M, T, and D). 97.3% of cyclovirus putative Caps (n = 37) exhibited Type A IDP profiles. 222 67.6% 10.8% 21.6% This study 25 40.0% 56.0% 4.0% Total 299 69.9% 13.0% 17.1% Capsid Analysis Only half of CRESS-DNA viral genomes described here contained an ORF that had significant BLASTX matches. most of the matches in the database were to putative CRESS-DNA viral Caps detected through metagenomic surveys. Type A Caps exhibit significant enrichment for amino acid residues that promote disorder (R, K, E, P, S, Q, and A) within the first 50 residues relative to amino acid residues 51\u2013125. there is a depletion of order promoting amino acid residues in this region compared to residues 1\u201325 and 76\u2013125. the percentage of predicted disordered and ordered residues does not add to 100% due to the presence of residues that are not considered either disordered or ordered. 97.3% of putative Caps from the Circovirus genus (n = 37) exhibited Type A IDP profiles.
