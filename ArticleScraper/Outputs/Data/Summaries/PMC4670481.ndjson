{"summary": "antibodies are a crucial part of the immune response toward invading pathogens. the induction of so-called neutralizing antibodies is a primary goal of vaccination. there is great interest in the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies specific for major human pathogens. the majority of antibodies in the polyclonal response have no neutralizing activity by the classical definition (22,23) this is due to the fact that they bind internal viral epitopes released from infected lysed cells, or viral surface proteins that are not involved in viral attachment and entry into host cells (24). neutralization of viruses by antibodies has until recently been assumed to be a solely extracellular or intravesicular event. TRIM21 is a multi-domain Fc receptor with ubiquitin ligase activity. binding site for TRIM21 was postulated to be localized to the CH2\u2013CH3 interface of Fc as it competed with binding of Staphylococcus protein A and Streptococcus protein G. TRIM5 consists of an N-terminal RING domain with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, a B-box, and a central coiled-coil domain that is referred to as RBCC (43) TRIM proteins are known to form dimers or higher order structures via their coiled-coil domains and both heteromeric and homomeric TRIMs have been described. SPRY domains of a dimeric TRIM21 molecule may bind simultaneously to one IgG Fc (32) this symmetrical mode of binding will allow TRIM21 to rapidly intercept incoming antibodies (32,34). the complex reveals a 2:1 stoichiometry where a PRYSPRY domain binds to the interface between the CH2 and CH3 found on each side of the Fc. neither TRIM21 nor FcRn binding to IgG is H433Fc forms a hydrogen bond with D452SPRY and stacks with F450SPRY. I253Fc of the CH2 loop encompassing residues 252\u2013256 is involved in a hydrophobic interaction with W299PRY. mouse TRIM21 binds IgG from a range of mammals (44) this is supported by inspection of the co-crystal structure between the mouse TRIM21 PRYSPRY domain and an Fc fragment derived from mouse IgG2a. the binding affinity between human IgG and the monomeric human PRYSPRY domain has been measured to 150 nM. despite relatively weak monomeric binding, the dimeric nature of full-length TRIM21 suggests that the functional affinities for IgM and IgA are much stronger (35). the weak monomeric binding of IgM and IgA is very likely due to the sequence variation in the stretch of amino acids corresponding to the apex HNH motif of IgG. proline\u2013tryptophan pairing is not a true aromatic stacking. the replacement of H435Fc with arginine in IgM abolishes its aromatic stacking potential with F450SPRY. arginine may still bind D452SPRY, given a favorable side chain conformation. TRIM21 engagement targets the virus for proteasomal degradation before it has had time to replicate and spread. this was first demonstrated using human adenovirus type 5 (AdV5) carrying the green fluorescent protein reporter gene as a model pathogen. protection from infection was found to correlate with the level of TRIM21 expression. non-neutralizing antibodies lyse the endosomal membrane and enters the cytosol where it is intercepted by TRIM21. ubiquitination leads to recruitment of the proteasomal machinery and rapid degradation of the viral complex. the degradation process has been demonstrated to be strictly dependent on the AAA ATPase v97/VCP. TRIM21 itself is the substrate for attachment of ubiquitin (32,84) ubiquitin machinery involves four enzymes: the ubiquitin activating (E1), the ubiquitin conjugating (E2), the substrate specifying ubiquitin ligase (E3), as well as the ubiquitin erasing deubiquitinase (DUB), of which E2 is responsible for the ubiquitin chain linkage topology. es of IgA exist, IgA1 and IgA2, and each is expressed as monomeric (mIgA), dimeric (dIgA), and secretory (S-IgA) forms (88). in serum, mIgA1 is the prevalent form while S-IgA2 dominates at mucosal sites (89,90). IgA and the SC may be broken upon exposure to the reducing environment of the cytosol, allowing attachment by TRIM21 (35). such higher forms of S-IgA may reach the cytosol together with TRIM21-susceptible pathogens. antibody\u2013virus stoichiometry required a higher antibody\u2013virus stoichiometry for neutralization to occur when cellular TRIM21 was depleted. this indicates a shift from cytosolic ADIN to entry blocking (69). as TRIM21 also engages IgM and IgA, it is likely to contribute to early protection. antibodies are DAMPs recognized by TRIM21. extracellular detection of antibody\u2013virus immune complexes by cell-surface-expressed FcRs results in phosphorylation of their intracellular immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif. this is achieved via pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) such as toll-like receptors (94) and cytosolic receptors for viral nucleic acid such as retinoic acid-inducible gene inhibition of ubiquitin-modified substrates prevents TRIM21-induced signaling (34). if a ubiquitin-modified substrate is targeted to the proteasome, there are three DUBs in the 19S regulatory particle, Usp14/Ubp6, Uch37/UCHL5, and Rpn11/Poh1, that remove ubiquitin before substrate degradation (101) it was recently demonstrated that cells depleted of Poh1 were unable to activate NF this involves increased expression of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I), as well as the activating NK2G2D ligands in non-hematopoietic cells (34). TRIM21 engagement results in rapid degradation of viral proteins, as well as inflammatory signaling that upregulates the expression of MHC I. the cell could \u2018cure\u2019 itself from infection by ADIN rather than being killed by effector lymphocytes. TRIM21-susceptible pathogens are highly dependent on the presence of antibodies in the cytosol. antibodies will be left behind at the cell membrane or inside endosomal vesicles. some non-enveloped viruses may also avoid TRIM21 detection due to their route of infection. a viral genome enters the nucleus (108), thus any attached antibody is readily accessible for TRIM21 recognition. the rapid detection at a stage prior to synthesis of new viral proteins may make TRIM21 detection particularly difficult to antagonize. a possible link between TRIM21 and the formation of autophagosomes in the context of salmonella enterica has been suggested. adenovirus type-1 (MAV-1) causes hemorrhagic encephalitis in mice. the ability of anti-MAV-1 serum to neutralize MAV-1 was assessed in cells derived from wildtype or TRIM21 knockout mice. a significant proportion of neutralization was TRIM21-dependent (123) early anti-serum and diluted late anti-serum were more dependent on TRIM21 for protection compared to non-diluted late anti-serum (124) TRIM21 functions become increasingly important as they are able to operate under conditions of few antibodies per virus (69,124) anti-HIV-1 IgG1 engineered for improved FcRn binding was shown to have increased serum half-life, enhanced mucosal localization and superior protection against intrarectal infection with simian-HIV (16) but the mechanistic correlation between these properties was not determined. TRIM21 detects antibodies that are carried by pathogens into the cytosol. TRIM21 activates pro-inflammatory signaling resulting in a protective response. TRIM21 binds all four subtypes of human IgG, but it is not known whether their use during infection results in different responses. this raises questions as to whether or not TRIM21 makes a significant contribution to protection at these body sites."}
