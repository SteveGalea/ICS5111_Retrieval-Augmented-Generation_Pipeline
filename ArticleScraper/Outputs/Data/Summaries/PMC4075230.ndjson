{"summary": "the chemokine CXCL10 is produced during infection and inflammation to activate the chemokine receptor CXCR3. septic shock was induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) in mice resuscitated with lactated Ringer\u2019s solution. interferon-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) is produced during periods of infection and inflammation in response to type I and type II interferons. CXCL10 activates the G-protein coupled chemokine receptor CXCR3, an important regulator of natural killer (NK), natural killer T (NKT) and T helper (Th)1 lymphocyte trafficking. elevated plasma CXCL10 concentrations are predictive of the transition from sepsis to septic shock in critically ill adults. the functional importance of CXCL10 in the pathogenesis of severe sepsis has not been ascertained. mice were anesthetized with 2 to 3% isoflurane in oxygen. a 1- to 2-cm midline incision was made through the abdominal wall. mice were resuscitated with intraperitoneal injection of 1 ml of lactated Ringer\u2019s. Mice were resuscitated with lactated Ringer\u2019s (LR) solution containing primaxin immediately after CLP. subsets of mice were monitored for survival. in additional mice, rectal temperature was measured. intraperitoneal leukocytes were harvested by lavage with 3 ml of PBS. intraperitoneal leukocytes were harvested by lavage with 3 ml of sterile PBS. cell viability was greater than 95% in all cases as determined by trypan blue exclusion. plasma and plasma samples were determined using iStat Chem8 cartridges. urea content of peritoneal lavage can be calculated as previously described. cytokines were used as markers of systemic inflammation. statistics All data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software. data from multiple group experiments were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance. survival data were analyzed using the unpaired t-test. the cecum was identified and ligated with a 3-0 silk suture. the incision was closed with a 20-gauge needle. Mice were resuscitated with intraperitoneal injection of 1 ml of lactated Ringer\u2019s. antibodies were given intravenously in the post-treatment experiments. Mice were monitored for survival for 7 days after CLP. recombinant CXCL10 treatment experiments Mice underwent CLP. NK cell numbers were made at 6 hours after CLP in mice that did not receive antibiotic treatment. spleens were harvested and placed in 35-mm dishes containing RPMI-1640 media with 10% fetal bovine serum. antibodies included anti-CD3, anti-NK1.1, anti-CD11b and anti-CD27. data were analyzed using an Accuri C6 flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) rectal temperature probe was performed on heparinized blood using CG4+ iStat Cartridges. bacterial counts were performed on blood, peritoneal lavage fluid and lung homogenates. samples were serially diluted in sterile saline and plated on tryptic soy agar. CXCL10 concentrations in plasma and peritoneal lavage were significantly higher than in plasma at 4, 8 and 16 hours after CLP. CXCL10 was not detectable in plasma or peritoneal lavage fluid in CXCL10 knockout (CXCL10KO) mice. plasma and peritoneal lavage were harvested at the indicated time points after CLP. hypothermia serves as a reliable indicator of physiological integrity and survival in mice during CLP-induced sepsis [11]. studies were undertaken to assess rectal temperature in wild-type and CXCL10KO mice during CLP-induced sepsis. temperature was measured at 12 hours after CLP, whereas temperature was measured at 24 hours after CLP in mice that received primaxin. effects of CXC chemokine 10 (CXCL10) deficiency on bacterial burden during cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis. n = 10 mice per group; *P 0.05 compared to control. effect of CXCL10 deficiency on bacterial clearance during CLP-induced sepsis. Bacterial colony forming units (CFU) were measured in mice treated with or without primaxin after CLP; n = 10 to 20 mice per group; *P 0.05 compared to wild-type, +P 0.05 compared to mice that did not receive primaxin treatment. all studies were performed in the absence of antibiotic treatment. the numbers of T (NK1.1-CD3+) or NKT (NK1.1+CD3+) cells in spleen and peritoneal lavage did not change at 6 hours after CLP. natural killer cell trafficking during cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis in wild-type and CXC chemokine 10 (CXCL10)-deficient mice. intraperitoneal leukocytes were harvested prior to or 6 hours after CLP. surface CD69 expression was measured on natural killer (NK) (NK) (NK1.1+CD3-), NKT (NK1.1+CD3+) and T (NK1.1-CD3+) lymphocytes using flow cytometry. plasma cytokines showed that IL-6 and MIP-2 concentrations were significantly lower in the anti-CXCL10 IgG group compared to the non-specific IgG group. Bacterial counts at all measured sites were significantly lower in mice treated with or without primaxin. Mice received IP resuscitation with 1 ml of lactated Ringer\u2019s solution. n = 10 mice per group, +P 0.05 compared to control. bacterial counts were measured in mice treated with or without primaxin. a significant decline at 4 hours after CLP and a further decline at 6 hours after CLP compared to non-septic mice. plasma concentrations of IL-6 and MIP-2 were significantly increased at 6 hours after CLP and mice were also bacteremic at that time point. survival was significantly improved in wild-type mice treated with anti-CXCL10 IgG at 2 hours. anti-CXCL10 IgG (anti-CXCL10, 100 g intravenously (IV)) or non-specific IgG (IgG, 100 g IV) at 2 or 6 hours after CLP. mice received intraperitoneal resuscitation with 1 ml of lactated Ringer\u2019s solution. n = 20 (2 hours post-treatment) to 25 (6 hours post-treatment) mice per group. XCL10 knock-out (CXCL10KO) mice showed significantly higher survival rates compared to wild-type mice (60% versus 10%) survival was prolonged in mice receiving antibiotics but overall mortality rates were similar with or without antibiotic treatment. hypothermia serves as a reliable indicator of physiological integrity and survival in mice during CLP-induced sepsis. XCL10KO mice treated with Primaxin showed significantly decreased rectal temperature at 24 hours after CLP compared to non-septic controls. plasma IL-6 and MIP-2 concentrations were also measured at 12 or 24 hours after CLP in mice treated without or with primaxin. significant differences in intraperitoneal bacterial counts were not observed when comparing CXCL10KO and wild-type mice. n = 10 to 20 mice per group; *P 0.05 compared to wild-type, +P 0.05 compared to mice that did not receive primaxin treatment. total NK cells were identified as NK1.1+CD3- lymphocytes. decline in total, pro-inflammatory and cytotoxic NK cells was observed in the spleen by 6 hours after CLP. numbers of immature NK cells in spleen and peritoneal lavage did not change during the first 6 hours after CLP. intraperitoneal NK, T and NKT lymphocytes from wild-type mice showed evidence of activation after CLP. at 6 hours post-CLP, the percentage of CD69+ NK cells and the CD69 MFI on NK cells were significantly lower in CXCL10KO mice compared to wild-type mice. mice treated with anti-CXCL10 IgG compared to mice treated with non-specific IgG. rectal temperature and plasma IL-6 and MIP-2 concentrations were measured in wild-type mice treated with non-specific IgG compared to non-septic controls. Mice received intraperitoneal resuscitation with 1 ml of lactated Ringer\u2019s solution. n = 10 to 15 mice per group, *P 0.05 compared to control. effect of CXC chemokine 10 blockade on rectal temperature and plasma cytokine concentrations during cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis. ml of lactated Ringer\u2019s solution, with or without primaxin (25 mg/kg), at the time of CLP; n = 10 mice per group, +P 0.05 compared to \u201c- Primaxin\u201d group. initial studies were undertaken to characterize the progression of sepsis in our model. mice were treated with anti-CXCL10 IgG (anti-CXCL10, 100 g intravenously (IV) or non-specific IgG (IgG, 100 g IV) at 2 or 6 hours after CLP. n = 20 (2 hours post-treatment) to 25 (6 hours post-treatment) mice per group; *P 0.05 compared to mice treated with non-specific IgG. treatment with anti-CXCL10 IgG and antibiotics was effective in improving survival. mice showed clinical signs of sepsis such as hypothermia, metabolic acidosis, systemic inflammation and bacteremia at the time of treatment. virulent strains of S. pneumoniae induce high CXCL10 expression. virulent strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococus aureus induced high concentrations CXCL10 in the lung after intrapulmonary challenge. ficient mice are resistant to septic shock caused by virulent strain of Streptococcus suis[36] that finding is consistent with previous studies that showed attenuated hyperinflammation and improved survival in IFN-deficient mice. the findings support a role of IFN/, IFN and CXCL10 in pathogenesis of septic shock. significantly decreased bacterial counts were observed in the blood and lungs. differences in bacterial burden were not observed at any of the sites tested in mice treated with anti-CXCL10. the mechanisms by which CXCL10 facilitates systemic inflammation remain to be ascertained. NK cell trafficking was attenuated in wild-type and CXCL10-deficient mice. differences in NK cell trafficking were not observed when comparing wild-type and CXCL10-deficient mice. this suggests that CXCL10 alone is not responsible for NK cell trafficking during CLP-induced sepsis. blockade of CXCL10, in combination with antibiotic treatment at 6 hours after CLP, was effective in improving survival compared to mice treated with non-specific IgG and antibiotics. further work is needed to define the potential application of CXCL10 blockade as a therapeutic agent during acute septic shock. short-acting inhibitors of the axis of the CXCL10-CXCR3 axis could serve as attractive agents during the acute phase of sepsis. the benefits of CXCL10 blockade were evident when anti-CXCL10 IgG was administered at 6 hours after the initiation of sepsis. authors declare that they have no competing interest. authors\u2019 contributions DH designed and performed survival studies, cytokine, bacterial burden and temperature measurements.
