{"summary": "a fulminant presentation of sepsis and pneumonia in a young adult requires rapid, definitive intervention to preserve life. a 29-year-old previously healthy male presented with high fever, tachycardia, hypoxia and bilateral, dense pulmonary infiltrates. the patient had no prior medical history and had no prior medical history. the patient was in severe distress, with a temperature of 40 degrees C, tachycardia, and an oxygen saturation of 45% on room air. he was intubated, sedated, and pharmacologically paralyzed. a chest radiograph showed diffuse pulmonary infiltrates. leukocyte count was 46,300 cells/mm3 with 68% neutrophils. arterial blood gas returned with a pH of 7.21, pCO2 of 48 mm Hg, pO2 of 74 mm Hg, and bicarbonate of 18 mEq/L. human immunodeficiency virus antibody was nonreactive. fulminant pulmonary blastomycosis was covered empirically with amphotericin from the time of his arrival in the ED. this delay is most often due to unrecognized infection, failure to initiate antibiotic therapy in the ED or failure to anticipate antimicrobial resistance. the surviving Sepsis campaign does recommend empiric antimicrobial therapy include one or more drugs that have activity and adequate tissue penetration against \u201call likely pathogens,\u201d including viruses and fungi. the guidelines on the management of critically ill patients with severe CAP highlight the need to cover empirically for resistant organisms. fulminant pneumonia can also be caused by rare zoonotic bacteria. fulminant pneumonitis can be due to non-infectious vasculitic or idiopathic disorders. methylprednisolone was given in this case. tomyces dermatitidis mold is found most commonly around the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence, Ohio, and Mississippi Rivers. annual incidence rates vary from 1\u20132 cases per 100,000 population to as high as 10\u201340 cases per 100,000 population in several northern Wisconsin counties. extending empiric therapy to cover endemic fungi and zoonotic infections such as pneumonic plague or tularemia. consider extending empiric therapy to cover endemic fungi (amphotericin B)"}
