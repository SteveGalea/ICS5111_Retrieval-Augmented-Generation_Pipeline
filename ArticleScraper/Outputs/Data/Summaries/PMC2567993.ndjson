{"summary": "female endoparasitic ichneumonid wasps inject virus-like particles into caterpillar hosts to suppress immunity. these particles are classified as ichnovirus virions and resemble ascovirus virions. ichnoviruses replicate DNA and produce virions. Approximately two-thirds of these wasps are endoparasites, meaning that the larval stages develop within the body cavity of their hosts. the ability of these parasites to develop within lepidopteran hosts without triggering an intense immune response has been the subject of numerous studies over the past forty years. chellus injects ascovirus, DpAV4 [7] into host pupae to circumvent host defence response. the last mechanism is by far the best-studied type of direct immune suppression by ichneumonid wasps. in some species, female wasps inject eggs along with ichnovirus particles into their hosts. similarities between particle structure and virions of known types of complex DNA insect viruses are striking. ichneumonid wasps produce enveloped bacilliform particles classified as bracoviruses. ichnoviruses resemble virions of ascoviruses, viruses lethal to lepidopterans. similar genomic differences occur between bracoviruses and baculoviruses. the ichnovirus proviral genome is excised and amplified in several segments in the female calyx cells. after assembly, these particles are secreted into the female genital tract. most of the genes borne by the particles are not related to viral genes. ichnovirus genomes are not found in ichnovirus genomes. it is the only ascovirus known to replicate in both its wasp and caterpillar hosts. it is transmitted vertically from wasp to caterpillars to suppress the defence response of the latter host, thereby enabling parasite development. BLAST results obtained with several ichnovirus ORFs in the genome provide evidence that certain ichnovirus ORFs have their closest relatives in an ascovirus genome. these genes seem to be specific to GfIV, as they are absent in the three sequenced genomes of other ichnoviruses. DpAV-4 ORF with well-characterized direct homologs in the genome of the Glypta fumiferanae ichnovirus (HfIV) is represented by white arrows. the sequence and features of the protein encoded by these ORF are detailed in fig. S1. encodes a protein of 161 amino acid residues similar only with the C-terminal domain of three proteins encoded by the ORFs 1, 1 and 3, contained in GfIV segments D1, D4 and D3. this protein of 849 amino acid residues is 43% similar over all its length to the C-terminal domain of the GfIV protein homologs encoded by the ORF1, 2, 1, 1, 1 and 1 in, respectively, the C20, C21, D1, D2, D3 a gene encoding a small protein is present that is similar to that encoded by the ORF069L of the iridovirus CIV. this corresponds to the ALI-like protein also found in entomopoxviruses. this could be considered a landmark of the symbiogenic ascovirus origin of the ichnovirus lineage to which this polydnavirus belongs. to date, only two virion proteins from the Campoletis sonorensis ichnovirus (CsIV) have been characterized. the first is the P44 (Acc N\u00b0 AAD01199), a structural protein that appears to be located as a layer between the out envelope and nucleocapsid. the second is the P12, a capsid protein (Acc N\u00b0 AF004367). WAPAM aligned the CsIV ichnovirus P44 structural protein with both models. Complementary structural and HCA confirmed the presence of the seven conserved domains in this structural protein. ten syntactic models were developed using proteins conserved in the three sequenced ascovirus species (SfAV1a, TnAV2c, and HvAV3a) and twelve iridoviruses. none of these models detected homologs among ichnovirus proteins available in databases. no ORFs encoding orthologs of P44 or other structural proteins are found in any of the other three ichnovirus genomes sequenced. orthologs of ichnovirus MCPs and other virion structural proteins are also likely located in the genomes of these wasps, i.e., not in proviral DNA. ichnoviruses evolved from ascoviruses by symbiogenesis. the cytoplasmic environment in which these viruses replicate is rich in bacterial DNA because their amobae and unicellular algae hosts feed on bacteria they digest in their cytoplasm. replication of these viruses is similar to that of bacteriophage T4. cleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDV) are common to all of them. recombination-primed replication occurs repeatedly during evolution of both these viruses and the genome of their eukaryotic hosts. lateral transfers are considered passive since they just result from the intimate environment and not from an active mechanism dedicated to genetic exchanges. sequences of polydnavirus origin may have been integrated in ascovirus genomes. one gene family related to a bacterial family of N-acetyl-L-glutamate 5-phosphotransferase (Acc. N\u00b0 of the closest bacterial relatives YP_001354925, CAM32558, ZP_00944224, ZP_02006449) identified only within the SfAV1a, HvAV3e and TnAV2c genome iridoviruses, like ascoviruses and other virus species, are vectored by parasitic wasps. databases were mined using all available ichnovirus virus proteins as queries. this indicates that passive lateral gene transfers from virus to eukaryotes remain rare events. genomes of endosymbiotic cyanobacteria and proteobacteria have evolved by reduction of several orders of magnitude to the approximate size of plasmids. this relocation of the genes encoding most proteins of the endosymbiotic bacteria to the host nucleus is the ultimate step of this evolutionary process, so-called endosymbiogenesis. endosymbiogenesis was proposed as the evolutionary mechanism that allowed some invertebrate viruses with a large double-stranded DNA genome related to the nudiviruses and the ascoviruses [22] to have led, respectively, to the origin of bracoviruses and ichnoviruses. however, the genomic differences between ascovirus and ichnovirus are in good agreement with the symbiogenetic hypothesis. elucidating the origins of ichnoviruses will be very time-consuming, requiring new accurate experimental approaches to generate more robust evidence. elucidating the origins of ichnoviruses will be very time-consuming, requiring new accurate experimental approaches to generate more robust evidence. genome sequenced by Genoscope (France) is 119,334-bp in length. BLAST results obtained with several ORFs in the DpAV4 genome provide evidence that certain ichnovirus ORFs have their closest relatives in an ascovirus genome. AV4 genome contains the gene cluster with direct homologs in the genome of the Glypta fumiferanae ichnovirus. the sequence and features of the protein encoded by these ORF are detailed in fig. S1. the sequence and the features of the protein encoded by these ORF are detailed in kbp. this protein of 849 amino acid residues is 43% similar over all its length to CIV ORF184R orthologs in all iridoviral and ascoviral genomes. it is only 36% similar over 350 amino acid residues to the C-terminal domain of the GfIV protein homologs encoded by the ORF1, 2, 1, 1, 1 and 1 in, respectively, the C20, C21, D1, D2, D3 and D4 segments. three DpAV4 genes have relatives in all ascovirus and iridovirus genomes. their presence in the genome of GfIV resulted from a lateral transfer from viral genomes closely related to those of GfIV and DpAV4. this might have happened when a Glypta wasp was infected by an ancestral virus related to DpAV4. BLAST searches using these sequences failed to detect any similarities between CsIV virion proteins and ascoviral or iridoviral MCPs. the models were designed on the basis of a previous study [22]. lanes 1 to 3) and secondary structure (lanes 4 to 6) comparisons among (a) MCP and (b) SfAV1a ORF061 orthologs from CsIV (lanes 1 and 4, typed in black), DpAV4 (lanes 2 and 5, typed in blue) and SfAV1a (lanes 3 and 6, typed in purple) ten syntactic models were developed using proteins conserved in the three sequenced ascovirus species (SfAV1a, TnAV2c, and HvAV3a) and twelve iridoviruses. none of these models detected homologs among ichnovirus proteins available in databases. orthologs of ichnovirus MCPs and other virion structural proteins are found in any of the other three ichnovirus genomes sequenced. phylogenetic analysis performed previously on P44 and the SfAV1a ORF061 orthologs indicated that they have an ancestor close to that of the ascoviruses and iridoviruses. ascovirus, iridovirus and ichnovirus genomes have a bacterial origin. the cytoplasmic environment in which these viruses replicate is rich in bacterial DNA because their amobae and unicellular algae hosts feed on bacteria that they digest in their cytoplasm. replication of these viruses is similar to that of bacteriophage T4. recombination-primed replication is able to allow reciprocal passive lateral transfers between viral genomes, host chromosomes, and bacterial DNA. in ascoviruses and iridoviruses, the occurrence of such lateral transfers is supported by BLASTp searches. sequences of polydnavirus origin may have been integrated in ascovirus genomes. one gene family related to a bacterial family of N-acetyl-L-glutamate 5-phosphotransferase (Acc. N\u00b0 of the closest bacterial relatives YP_001354925, CAM32558, ZP_00944224, ZP_02006449) identified only within the SfAV1a, HvAV3e and TnAV2c genome lateral gene transfers from virus to eukaryotes are rare events in ichnovirus genomes. one case of such lateral transfer was described in the CcBV genome. two genes encoding AcMNPV P94-related proteins have their closest relatives among granuloviruses. genomes of endosymbiotic cyanobacteria and proteobacteria have evolved by reduction of several orders of magnitude to the approximate size of plasmids. this relocation of the genes encoding most proteins of the endosymbiotic bacteria to the host nucleus is the ultimate step of this evolutionary process, so-called endosymbiogenesis. genesis was proposed as the evolutionary mechanism that allowed some invertebrate viruses with a large double-stranded DNA genome related to the nudiviruses and the ascoviruses [22] to have led, respectively, to the origin of bracoviruses and ichnoviruses. however, the genomic differences between ascovirus and ichnoviruses are in good agreement with the symbiogenetic hypothesis. elucidating the origins of ichnoviruses will be very time-consuming, requiring new accurate experimental approaches to generate more robust evidence. elucidating the origins of ichnoviruses will be very time-consuming. proviral genome from the recruitment by recombination or transposition of ascoviral and host genes located elsewhere in the wasp chromosomes is consistent with data recently published [58]. Methods Database mining Searches for similarities were mainly developed using facilities of BLAST programs at two websites. syntactic model for ascoviruses, iridoviruses, phycodnaviruses, mimiviruses and asfarviruses was obtained. the procedure was done until we were only able to detect exact match with the syntactic model. this simplified the statistical treatment of the result obtained with WAPAM. syntactic model for orthologs in ascovirus, iridovirus, phycodnavirus and asfarvirus genomes: [GE]-[DE]-x(1)-[ILMVFYW]-x(20,80)-[ILMVFYW]-x(9)-[ILMVFYW]-x(4)-[ILMVFYW]-x(10,16)-[ILMVFYW]-x(5,105)-[ the closest gene was located using the distance trees supplied with each BLAST search at the NCBI website. we used motifs resulting from MEME to make MAST minings in databases at http://meme.sdsc.edu/meme/mast.html. we therefore constructed syntactic models that only included the most conserved positions and their variable spacing using WAPAM. syntactic model for MCP orthologs in ascovirus, iridovirus, phycodnavirus and asfarvirus genomes. syntactic model for MCP orthologs in ascovirus, iridovirus and phycodnavirus genomes. x(3)-[ILMVFYW]-[ILMVFYW]-x(3,6)-[AST]-x(14)-[ILMVFYW]-x(18,90)-P. orthologs of the SfAV1a ORF061 in ascovirus, iridovirus, phycodnavirus and asfarvirus genomes.
