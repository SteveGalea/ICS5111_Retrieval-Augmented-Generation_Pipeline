{"summary": "avian influenza virus (AIV) is an enveloped virus with a negative sense, single-stranded and segmented RNA. the host must produce appropriate immune responses in a short period of time to limit viral replication and eliminate the virus. pathogenicity of AIV in chickens is initiated by same phenomenon as mentioned above. chicken tracheal epithelium contains three types of cells (ciliated cells, goblet cells and basal cells) which express both SA2\u20136Gal and SA2\u20133Gal linkages. ciliated cells are more sensitive to AIV compared to goblet and basal cells. in chickens, expression of TLRs in trachea is up-regulated following AIV infection. despite lack of RIG-1 in chickens to sense AIV infection, AIV is sensed intracellularly by chicken melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5. the same panel of TLR ligands and the ligand for TLR7 have also been administrated in vivo in chickens to induce antiviral responses. these TLR ligands reduced oral and cloacal viral shedding in infected chickens. tracheas were dissected manually into 1 mm rings using a microtome blade. five tracheal rings from one embryo were transferred into 24-well plates. tracheal rings were stimulated with two concentrations of the following TLR ligands. the control groups received 10 g/mL synthetic non-CpG ODN (5\u2032-TGCTGCTTGTGTGCTT-3\u2032) (Sigma-Aldrich) or medium in a final volume of 500 L. at 3, 8 and 18 h post-stimulation, tracheal rings were collected for RNA extraction. superscript II first Strand Synthesis kit and Oligo(dT)20 primers were used for cDNA synthesis according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocols. quantitative real-time PCR was performed on diluted cDNA (1:10 in DEPC treated water) using a SYBR green dye in a lightCycler 480 II. d with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 200 U/mL penicillin, 80 g/mL streptomycin and 50 g/mL gentamicin. cells were infected with H4N6 AIV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1.0. residual virus was removed two hours post-infection by washing twice with warm medium. tracheas were dissected manually into 1 mm rings using a microtome blade. five tracheal rings from one embryo were transferred into 24-well plates. tracheal rings were stimulated with two concentrations of the following TLR ligands. the control groups received 10 g/mL synthetic non-CpG ODN (5\u2032-TGCTGCTTGTGTGCTT-3\u2032) (Sigma-Aldrich) or medium in a final volume of 500 L. at 3, 8 and 18 h post-stimulation, tracheal rings were collected for RNA extraction. quantitative real-time PCR was performed on diluted cDNA (1:10 in DEPC treated water) using a SYBR green dye in a lightCycler 480 II (Roche Diagnostics, Laval, QC, Canada) as previously described. specific sequences of primers were described previously [29,30,31]. cells were infected with H4N6 AIV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1.0. residual virus was removed two hours post-infection by washing twice with warm medium. expression of iNOS by TOCs that received low dose and high dose of CpG ODN was significantly increased only at 18 h post-treatment. expression of iNOS was assessed at 3, 8 and 18 h post-treatment. gene expression is presented as fold change relative to the non CpG ODN group in CpG (low and high doses) groups.

Error bars represent standard errors of the means. culture supernatants from TOCs collected 24 h post-treatment with TLR ligands or medium. treatment of chicken macrophages with SupTOC-LPS-24h did not significantly reduce virus titer in macrophage supernatants. cells were infected 6 h later with H4N6 avian influenza virus (MOI of 1.0) titer (12 h after infection) was quantified by a TCID50 assay. a\u2013c columns with no common letter are significantly different (p 0.05). to determine innate antiviral responses of chicken tracheas treated with TLR ligands. the current study made it possible to determine innate responses induced by TLR ligands in the trachea. IL-1 induces proliferation of cells and recruit lymphocytes to the trachea. the same scenario may apply to in vivo conditions whereby macrophages play important roles in host defense against infection of the trachea by viral pathogens. antiviral responses are necessary to suppress viral replication and virus spread within the host. in and PKR in TOCs even prior to induction of type I IFNs. significant up-regulation of OAS, viperin and PKR may support IFN-independent activation of these ISGs. this observation has been previously reported in humans and mice. incubation time between TOCs treated with different TLR ligands may be correlated with the nature and quantity of the antiviral compounds produced by TOCs during the incubation. the difference in the effects of incubation time between TOCs treated with different TLR ligands. chicken tracheal organ cultures are able to mount antiviral responses after stimulation with different TLR ligands. this was confirmed by examining gene expression in tracheal organ cultures."}
