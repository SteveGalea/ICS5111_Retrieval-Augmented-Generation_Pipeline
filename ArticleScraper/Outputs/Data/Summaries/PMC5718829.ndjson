vectors have been successfully used to boost responses in adults induced by vaccination with BCG in infancy. they encode four proteins from three ebolavirus species and marburg virus. the large genome of MVA allows insertion of a larger amount of foreign DNA compared with other viral vectors including adenoviruses. in adenoviral vectored vaccines, the antigen is typically placed under the control of a heterologous, strong promoter. it is encoded in an independent expression cassette which is inserted into a well-characterised location in the adenoviral genome. this is most commonly the E1 locus, which renders the virus replication incompetent. first adenoviral vaccine vectors to be developed were based on human adenovirus serotype 5 (HAd5) pre-existing anti-HAd5 antibodies present in a large proportion of the human population could dampen the humoral and cellular immune response to the vaccine antigen. chimpanzee adenoviral vectors (ChAds) have successfully been used in clinical trials against a variety of diseases. adenoviral vectors can encode antigens which are not membrane-bound glycoproteins. adenoviral vectors rely on the endogenous glycoprotein (VSV-G) for viral entry. tissue tropism and replication competency of the viral vector have to be taken into consideration. adenoviral vectors have a well-characterised safety profile across a range of age groups. each vaccine might need to be produced at a scale of 500,000 \u2013 2 million doses. each vaccine might need to be produced at a scale of 500,000 \u2013 2 million doses. rVSV-vector production facilities exist in many countries. sensitivity of any VSV-based vaccine to pH changes is presumably dependent on the specific envelope glycoprotein (i.e. the vaccine antigen) variation in stability is expected to be minimal, since the vaccine antigen is not present in the viral capsid. new approaches for thermostabilisation have recently been developed for adenoviral vectored vaccines. a significant obstacle in this approach is that the pathogen must be infectious in rodents if the efficacy of the vaccine is to be assessed preclinically. the data may rely on mouse-adapted or chimeric pathogens. human body fluids 24-88% Central Africa Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) Coronaviridae Betacoronavirus Bats, dromedary camels Contact with bats or camels, Human-to-human transmission common 36% Middle East, Korea Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) Coronaviridae Betacoronavirus Bats establishing a mouse model could take significant time, particularly for evaluation of numerous viral isolates or serial passaging of a virus in mice. use of neonatal mice or knockout mice (e.g. of IFN-/R, STAT-1) have been required to mimic human disease for Ebola, Marburg, Lassa, Nipah, or Zika viruses in mice. a vaccine for an outbreak pathogen would be likely to gain approval for use in a limited setting. based on research, manufacturing and clinical trial costs for the ChAd3 vectored vaccine developed for Ebola, vaccines might be stockpiled for just $50 million per disease. deployment would provide efficacy data in humans required for approval by a national regulator. the coalition for epidemiological preparedness innovations (CEPI) was launched in January 2017. the initial fund is $460 million, with the European Commission pledging co-funding of \u20ac250 million. the approach undertaken by CEPI will advance vaccine development for diseases where research has been limited. development through to licensure estimated at upwards of $200 million to $500 million per vaccine. opportunities to assess efficacy of these vaccines in humans would be rare. the 2014 outbreak provided a much-needed impetus to improve pandemic preparedness for emerging pathogens. monoclonal antibody treatment may be efficacious in a short window post-exposure, but this treatment option is not suitable for large-scale use. soluble glycoprotein (sG) subunit vaccine from the related henipavirus Hendra virus (HeV) can protect ferrets and AGM from experimental challenge with NiV. Lassa virus is a medically relevant arenavirus which produces conditions ranging from asymptomatic infection to a lethal haemorrhagic fever, Lassa fever (LF) annually, LASV appears to infect between 300,000 to 500,000 individuals with mortality rates ranging from 2% to in excess of 50% in outbreaks. this epidemiology suggests that efficacy trials of Lassa fever vaccines could be conducted successfully in countries such as Nigeria and Sierra Leone. cellular immunity is thought to be critical for survival of LF infection. early and strong T-cell responses are associated with effective control of virus replication and recovery. fatal LASV infection of NHP has been associated with a lack of peripheral T-cell activation. rhesus and cynomolgus monkeys are considered the gold-standard models. the YFV vaccine strain 17D has been genetically manipulated to express the LASV glycoprotein. it was designed to control both diseases, YF and LF, in areas of overlap incidence in west africa. novel coronaviruses have emerged over the last decade, causing outbreaks mainly in the Middle East region and Asia. an epidemic of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) was reported in 2003, which started in china. mouse models are likely to be less useful for the assessment of immune correlates than larger animal models such as rhesus macaques and common marmosets. a single-antigen pathogen-specific ChAd vector vaccine could be suitable as a single dose approach for rapid induction of protective immunity. a pipeline approach is currently being adopted for at least twelve potential outbreak pathogens using standardized preclinical processes. the key processes, such as generation of constructs, production of virus stocks and defining preclinical immunogenicity can be substantially standardized. aire + Sudan ebolavirus + marburg yersinia pestis Nipah virus SARS CoV GMP is good-manufacturing practice. key bottlenecks for this approach are the identification of vaccine antigens and the availability of appropriate animal models of disease. plasmid-based homologous recombination in E. coli leads to de-novo expression of the antigen in the vaccine target cells. capsid-incorporation approach has shown promise for induction of antigen-specific antibodies using modified adenoviral vectors. however, as the capsid-display strategy has not yet been evaluated in clinical trials, this review will focus on traditionally engineered adenoviral vectors with antigen cassettes. chimpanzee adenoviral vectors have successfully been used in clinical trials against a variety of diseases. simian adenoviral vectors (ChAds) are non-enveloped viruses, meaning that the antigen (e.g. a membrane glycoprotein) is not present on the surface of the vector, but is expressed at high levels once the vector enters the target cells of the vaccinated individual. this is in contrast to VSV-based vaccine vector a replication-deficient vector (such as ChAd) carries less safety risks than a replication-deficient vector (such as ChAd) since the inability to replicate prevents dissemination of the vector throughout the body. adenoviral vectors have a well-characterised safety profile, across a range of age groups. denoviral vector production facilities exist in many countries. adenoviral vectors may need to contain certain E4 genes from HAd5 in order to grow to high titers in current HAd5-E1-transcomplementing cell lines. this need for optimisation has not been a hurdle to large-scale manufacturing so far. new approaches for thermostabilisation have recently been developed for adenoviral vectors. such as immobilization of viral particles in a sugar glass on a filter41 or the use of biocompatible additives to slow down the degradation of virus particles. these improvements are expected to have a significant impact on the deployment of vectored vaccines in challenging climates. c fevers (including Lassa Fever) Arenavirus, e.g. Lassavirus (LASV) Arenaviridae Mammarenavirus Mastomys rats Contact with rat urine or faeces, contact with infected body fluids 1% west africa Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever virus (CCHFV) Bunyaviridae Nairovirus Domestic animals/ Hyalomma ticks Tick bites, Nipah virus (NiV), also Cedar, Hendra. Paramyxoviridae Henipavirus Fruit bat (Pteropodidae family), pigs Contact with bats and pigs 75% Malaysia, India, Bangladesh Rift Valley Fever Rift valley fever virus (RVF) a new strategy for developing vaccines against outbreak pathogens would be to focus on manufacturing small stockpiles of vaccine using a common platform. the overall strategy would be to generate suitable stockpiles for emergency response use having previously demonstrated safety and immunogenicity of each vaccine up to Phase II trials in the target geographical regions. this would require fulfilment of certain conditions including that no comparable or satisfactory therapy is available. in 2015 the WHO published a list of nine diseases requiring urgent vaccine R&D to prevent public health emergencies in the future. key characteristics of the diseases prioritised by the WHO are summarised in Table 3. the process of prioritising diseases took into account properties of the causative pathogen e.g. transmissibility. the coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) was launched in January 2017. the initial fund is $460 million, with the european commission also pledging co-funding of \u20ac250 million and further funding due to be confirmed from the Government of India by the end of 2017. the approach undertaken by CEPI will advance vaccine development for diseases where research has been limited. Nipah Virus (NiV) is a recently-recognised and highly pathogenic paramyxovirus that can cause severe disease in man with high associated fatality rates (up to 100%) outbreaks have occurred in Malaysia, Singapore and India with almost annual occurrence in Bangladesh. a soluble glycoprotein (sG) subunit vaccine from the related henipavirus Hendra virus (HeV) can protect ferrets and AGM from experimental challenge with NiV or HeV. a number of viral vectored vaccines have also been tested and show promising immunogenicity. ,67 LF is an endemic zoonosis in parts of west africa. more recent studies highlighting the spread of LASV into surrounding areas. the common African rat (Mastomys natalensis) is the zoonotic reservoir for LASV. there are no approved vaccines. the four replication-competent LASV vaccine candidates have been extensively studied. the four replication-competent vaccine candidates are based on vaccinia virus,76,77 vesicular stomatitis virus,78 mopeia virus (MOPV)79 and yellow fever virus (YFV) 17D vectors80. the YFV vaccine strain 17D has been genetically manipulated to express the LASV glycoprotein. rVSV expressing LASV glycoprotein was protective in nonhuman primate challenge, the protection was not sterile and LASV viremia could be measured post-infection. both marmosets and guinea pigs have survived an otherwise fatal LASV infection. the isolation of another novel coronavirus followed, known as MERS CoV, which has subsequently caused nearly 1900 cases and 670 deaths. strategies for producing effective coronavirus vaccines have focused on expression of either the spike protein or nucleocapsid proteins. the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine is being considered for deployment in a ring vaccination design to protect contacts and frontline healthcare workers (HCWs) this fresh outbreak is the 8th to occur in the DRC and highlights the potential utility of vaccination to protect HCWs. the genetic background for all vectors is ChAdOx1 (a species E modified chimpanzee adenovirus based on isolate Y25) the key bottlenecks for this approach are the identification of vaccine antigens and the availability of appropriate animal models of disease. the pace of vaccine development for Ebola has been slow since 1976. most vaccines undergoing preclinical evaluation for more than 5 years before the start of Phase I clinical trials."}
