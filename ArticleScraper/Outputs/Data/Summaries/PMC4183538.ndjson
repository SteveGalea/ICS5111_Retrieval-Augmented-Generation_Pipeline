{"summary": "residents 65 years from 32 nursing homes in 4 Canadian cities were enrolled in fall 2009, 2010 and 2011 and followed for one influenza season. peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained and analysed by flow cytometry for T-regs, CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell subsets (CCR7+CD45RA+, CCR7-CD45RA+ and CD28-CD57+) human metapneumovirus, coronavirus and rhinovirus can also cause severe disease in this population [1], [3]\u2013[7]. it is a widely held belief that immunosenescence is responsible for this increased risk and severity of infection. however, only sparse data exist to substantiate this position. the accumulation of a separate class of T-cell, the regulatory CD4+ T-cell (T-regs) in elderly people has also been observed in elderly nursing home residents [10] and community dwelling elderly people [21]. if a relationship is established, this could help identify elderly nursing home residents at highest risk of becoming ill and provide more focused care through targeted prevention. study protocol approved by the Research Ethics Board at each participating institution and nursing home. participants received seasonal influenza vaccine, typically in October or November, by public health nurses. PBMCs were isolated and frozen using a common standard operating procedure. aliquot was placed in round-bottom plates with anti-CD3-Qdot605, anti-CD8-Alexa Flour 700 and anti-CD45RA-PE Texas Red. T-regs were defined as CD4+CD25hiCD127loFoxp3+. CD4+ and CD8+ immune phenotypes and T-regs were expressed as a percentage of CD3+. T-regs were analyzed using an automated gating pipeline. thawed PBMCs were cultured overnight at 37\u00b0C and stimulated with CMV peptides (2 ug/ml) for 1 hr at 37\u00b0C. a matched set of PBMCs were stimulated with DMSO as a negative control. unadjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were first constructed to explore the relationship between immune phenotypes and time to symptomatic respiratory viral infection. if a resident had multiple respiratory viral infections, only the first infection was included as an outcome. the proportional hazards assumption for categorical variables was examined by a log-minus-log graph to ensure the plotted lines remained parallel. the presence of multicollinearity was examined using the variance inflation factor (VIF); presence of multicollinearity was defined as VIF >5. the clinical frailty scale has been validated in the nursing home population [23]. participants received the seasonal influenza vaccine, typically in October or November, by public health nurses in accordance with guideline recommendations for the given year [24]\u2013[26]. an aliquot (0.5\u201316106 cells/stain) was placed in round-bottom 96-well plates with anti-CD3-Qdot605, anti-CD8-Alexa Flour 700, anti-CD4-Pacific Blue, anti-CD45RA-PE Texas Red, anti-CD28-PE, anti-CD57-FITC, anti-CCR7-PE Cy7. the following antibodies were purchased from eBioscience. T-cell subpopulations were identified using characteristics of their density distribution such as the number of peaks, height and width of each peak, change of the slope in the distribution curve, standard deviation, and median density. CCR7 thresholds were estimated based on CD57+ populations given the explicit instruction that CD57+ cells are CCR7-. the cells were stained with anti-CD4-PacificBlue and anti-CD8-AlexaFluor700. the cells were stained with anti-IFN--APC, anti-TNF--FITC and anti-CD3-QDot605. nucleic acid was extracted by the bioMerieux easyMAG automated extractor. if a resident died prior to a respiratory viral infection, their time was censored on the date of death. a priori, it was decided that age, sex and frailty would be included in the final multivariable model. the median age was 86 years (IQR 80\u201390 years) and the ages ranged from 65\u2013102 years. most (93%) had at least one co-morbidity and almost half (44%) scored either 7 or 8 on the Clinical Frailty Scale. T cell phenotypes were defined using the flowDensity software package. Lymphocytes and singlets were gated and then separated into CD4+CD8- and CD4-CD4+. expression of CD57, CD28, CD45RA and CCR7 was analyzed on either CD4+CD8- or CD8-CD4+. set up to select CD25+CD127 lo/ and T-regs were defined as CD25+CD127 lo/ FOXP3+. PBMC were stimulated with pp65 peptides to identify CMV-reactive T cells. as a negative control, PBMC were stimulated with DMSO. subsequently, the T-cells were stained for surface markers and intracellular cytokines. enza 4 (5) Parainfluenza 1 3 (3) Parainfluenza 2 1 (1) *One patient had mixed influenza A and rhinovirus. proportional hazards assumption was satisfied for all covariates included in the model.
