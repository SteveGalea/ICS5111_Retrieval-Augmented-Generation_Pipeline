{"summary": "apo and holo HCoV-OC43 S ligands are recognized by distinct regions of the HCoV-OC43 S, human galectin-3 or rotavirus VP8* -sandwich. each domain is shown in the same two orientations for comparison. free 9-O-Ac-Me-Sia receptor does not trigger HCoV-OC43 S fusogenic conformational changes. wild-type HCoV-OC43 S ectodomain trimer remained in the prefusion conformation after cleavage with 28 g.mL1 trypsin. the resolution was determined to 2.9 and 2.8 for the apo and holo HCoV-OC43 S glycoprotein maps, respectively. the 0.143 and 0.5 cut-off values are indicated by horizontal dashed lines. wild-type HCoV-OC43 S ectodomain trimer was cleaved with 28 g.mL1 trypsin and heated for 20 minutes at 50 \u00b0C in the absence (g) or presence (h) of 10% isopropanol (used to dissolve the trypsin inhibitor added to stop the prote) Coronavirus S galectin-like A domains have a conserved architecture."}
