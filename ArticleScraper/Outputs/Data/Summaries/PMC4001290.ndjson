{"summary": "retrospective cohort study includes patients who first received transplant between December 1990 and December 2011 at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC) only an individual's first episode of PIV infection was analyzed from the FHCRC database. peak steroid dose was recorded within 2 weeks before and after LRTD diagnosis. exact steroid dose at 1 month after diagnosis was also collected. death caused by respiratory failure was defined as any death caused exclusively or predominantly by respiratory failure. URTI was defined as PIV detection in a nasopharyngeal or sputum sample. LRTD was divided into 3 groups: possible, probable, and proven. LRTD was defined as PIV detection in a bronchoalveolar lavage. the log-rank test was used to compare univariable hazards of time-to-event outcomes between disease categories. the probability of overall survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. 65 (64) Female 223 (41) 144 (42) 38 (49) 4 (21) 37 (36) Age at transplant, y.14 20 105 (19) 71 (20) 19 (24) 3 (16) 12 (12) 21\u201360 365 (67) 227 (66) 45 (58) 15 (79) 78 (77) >60 74 (14) 47 (14) 14 (18) 1 (5) 12 (12) Transplant yeara.001 1990\u20132000 269 (49) 175 (51) 25 (32) 15 ( PIV typec PIV-1 52 (10) 26 (8) 16 (21) 1 (5) 9 (9) PIV-2 30 (5) 24 (7) 3 (4) 0 (0) 3 (3) PIV-3 434 (80) 275 (80) 53 (68) 17 (90) 89 (87) PIV-4 22 (4) 16 (5) 5 (6) 1 (5) 0 (0) 1 (1) Quantitative viral load, median (range) 5.0 106 (1.0 102\u20131.1 109) 4.8 105 61 (18) 21 (27) 1 (5) 37 (37) Monocyte count.001 >100 106 cells/L 381 (73) 266 (81) 53 (70) 11 (58) 51 (51) 100 106 cells/L 141 (27) 61 (19) 23 (30) 8 (42) 49 (49) Steroid dose before diagnosisc No 242 (47) 160 (50) 40 (53) 5 (26) 37 (38) 1 mg/kg 133 (26) 78 (24) 25 (34) 4 (21) 26 (26) 1 a copathogen was defined as a significant pathogen detected in concurrent nasopharyngeal, bronchoalveolar lavage, or lung biopsy samples. e Ribavirin was administered as follows: aerosolized in 45 patients, systemic in 10, both in 1, and unknown in 5.
