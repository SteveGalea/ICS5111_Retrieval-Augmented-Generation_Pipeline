{"summary": "cis-acting elements in an mRNA can direct elongating ribosomes to shift reading frame by 1 base in the 5\u2032 direction (1\u20133) many RNA viruses utilize 1 PRF, including most Retroviruses, Coronaviruses, Flaviviruses and Totiviruses. the mRNAs transcribed from these viral templates contain two overlapping ORFs. small alterations in programmed frameshifting efficiencies promote rapid loss of the yeast dsRNA L-A \u2018killer\u2019 virus (9\u201320). increasing the amount of Gag-pol protein synthesized may cause too many particles to initiate non-productively while producing too little may prevent efficient dimerization (9). a number of quantitative assays have been employed to monitor 1 PRF. in vitro translation assays have the advantage of directly monitoring product formation. however, direct product monitoring presents numerous roadblocks to high-throughput screening applications. a yeast-based dual-fluorescence system can accurately detect changes in 1 PRF caused by mutations and drugs. this single plate assay is rapid, inexpensive and amenable to HTS applications. pJD0981 harbored the HIV-1 M type -1 PRF signal with EGFP in the 1 frame. pJD1197 harbored the HIV-1 M type -1 PRF signal with EGFP in the 1 frame. pJD1198 was used as the empty vector control. yeast were plated onto selective media for 3 days and then transferred to 4 ml of selective media with or without 60 g/ml anisomycin. each strain was measured seven times for each reporter by sequentially mixing 10 l of lysate with 50 l of Promega\u2019s LARII reagent followed by 50 l of Stop and Glo dual luciferase reagent. yeast strains and plasmids JD932 (MATa ade 2-1 trp1-1 ura3-1 leu2-3, 112 his3-11, 15 can1-100) were used for anisomycin studies. the wild-type rpl11 yeast strain was JD1381 (rpl11-Y52), and JD1433 (rpl11-92-6A) pJD1197 harbored the HIV-1 M type -1 PRF signal with EGFP in the 1 frame. pJD1198 was used as the empty vector control. pJD0395 (a.k.a. pRS426) was used as the empty vector control. 1 PRF (FS%) was calculated as follows: where G is the green fluorescence for yeast transformed with test or control vector; R is red fluorescence for yeast transformed with empty vector; Rev is red fluorescence for yeast transformed with test or control vector; ODev is optical density of cells transformed with empty vector. Yeast were plated onto selective media for 3 days and then transferred to 4 ml of selective media with or without 60 g/ml anisomycin. ULTS is a simple and inexpensive assay of 1 PRF in yeast. each sample costs approximately $2 ($1 each for test and control) each sample costs approximately $2 ($1 each for test and control) a timecourse experiment monitored HIV-1 promoted 1 PRF every 20 min for a total of 46 h in the presence (pink traces) or absence (blue traces) of 60 g/ml anisomycin, a drug that inhibits 1 PRF. this is likely due to a combination of two factors: low cell densities and the time-dependent requirement for the two reporter proteins to mature. anisomycin and the yeast rpl11-92-96A mutant were expected to promote decreased rates of 1 PRF. rpl11-Y52 mutant was expected to promote increased 1 PRF. rpl11-Y52 mutant was expected to promote increased 1 PRF. the dual-luciferase reporter system recapitulates data obtained using a dual-luciferase reporter system. the experiments were repeated using our previously described dual-luciferase assay system. the results match our previous findings for these conditions where 60 g/ml anisomycin inhibited 1 PRF, rpl11-Y52 promoted increased 1 PRF and rpl11-92-6A promoted decreased 1 PRF. read-through control plasmid contains Ds-Red and EGFP ORFs. insertion of one nucleotide 5\u2032 of the 1 PRF signal inactivates frameshifting. 1 PRF test plasmid is the same as the control plasmid. luciferase reporter in yeast cells was able to recapitulate the inhibitory effect of anisomycin on 1 PRF as fold wild-type levels. this drug inhibits 1 PRF by 40%, consistent with previous findings (13). mediated 1 PRF decreased in rpl11-92-96A mutant. increased in rpl11-92-96A and increased in rpl11-Y52 strain. in vivo dual-fluorescence assay, 1 PRF rates are automatically calculated. it flags samples with statistically significant Z-scores. features inherent in the calculation of 1 PRF efficiency also have two critical built in advantages. the killer assay involves replica-plating test cells onto a lawn of uninfected indicator yeast cells seeded onto 4.7 MB plates. the killer assay can be either performed manually (in the case of a few hits) or scale up for high-throughput robotic screening. dual-luciferase assays can be used to validate potential hits. in vitro assays can identify compounds that directly affect 1 PRF. in vitro assays can identify compounds that directly affect 1 PRF. rpl11-Y52 mutant cells and rpl11-92-6A mutant cells can be used as quality control for up- and down-frameshifting. parallel processing of multiple plates can speed this process, rendering this bottleneck insignificant."}
