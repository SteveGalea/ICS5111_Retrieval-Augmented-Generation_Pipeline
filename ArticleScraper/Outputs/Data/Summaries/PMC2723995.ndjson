{"summary": "imidazoline receptors are classified into three main types: I1R, I2R, and I3R [2\u20134]. I1R and I2R have been implicated in hypertension and psychiatric disorder regulation, while I3R may be involved in insulin secretion [5\u20139] hIRAS or Nischarin may serve as I1R itself, or at least a functional subunit of I1R. despite intensive efforts, the molecular base of the I1R had not yet been elucidated. monoclonal antibody against hIRAS region including the PX domain (10\u2013120aa) development has great utility for immunoblotting, indirect immunofluorescent staining, immunoprecipitation, and flow cytometry. fusion protein eluted with lysis buffer with 400 mM imidazole. purified nusA-IRAS(10\u2013120aa) was coated on plates at 100 L aliquot per well, 4\u00b0C overnight. -IRAS protein (50 g in a volume of 80 L) was mixed with an equal volume of Freund's complete adjuvant. the mouse with the highest antibody titer tested by ELISA was boosted intraperitoneally with 100 g NusA-IRAS(10\u2013120aa) protein without adjuvant 3 days before the cell fusion. membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in TBST (20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, and 0.05% [v/v] Tween 20) blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase conjugated goat antimouse antibodies. blots were developed with enhanced electrochemiluminescence. lysates were centrifuged to remove debris. lysates were incubated with IRAS or c-myc mAbs overnight at 4\u00b0C. samples were boiled to release bound proteins and appropriate supernatant aliquots were run on lysis buffer. expression vector pET43.1a-IRAS, pCMV-myc-IRAS, and pEGFPC1-IRAS were inserted into the pET-43.1a(+) expression vector (Novagen) the full-length human IRAS was obtained by PCR amplification of the entire coding region. the resulting 4512-bp PCR product was ligated into the pEGPC1 and PCMV-myc vectors. selected colonies were cultured in ampicillin-containing LB media. Isopropyl--D-thio galactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to a final concentration of 1 mM. cells were harvested, mixed with lysis buffer, and sonicated. the wells were incubated with 150 L horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antimouse IgG (dilution 1 : 5000, Santa Cruz) for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C after thorough washing. peroxidase activity was detected using o-phenylenediamine and H2O2 as enzyme substrates. Isotypes of antibodies were identified with a mouse subisotype panel (Bio-Rad) the pristine-primed BALB/c mice were injected intraperitoneally with 1 106 hybridoma cells per mouse. the ascitic fluid was collected and mAbs were purified with a protein A/G affinity column. nuclei were stained with 0.1 mg/mL Hoechst33342 (Molecular Probes) Specimens were examined by confocal fluorescent microscopy on a Bio-Rad Radiance 2100 System. hek293 cells were transfected with PCMV-myc-IRAS or PCMV-myc plasmid to analyze IRAS mAbs immunoprecipitated with IRAS. cells were washed and resuspended in an affinipure goat antimouse IgG (Santa Cruz) cells were washed and resuspended in an FITC-conjugated goat antimouse IgG. samples were analyzed on a flow immunocytometry machine (Becton-Dickinson) IRAS is a large protein comprising of 1504 amino acids. its NH2-terminal phox domain is important for membrane association and cellular localization. dissolved protein yielded 78 kDa expected molecular weight. the 2 mice with the highest titers were sacrificed and spleens from both mice were fused to myeloma cells. supernatant from the growing hybridoma clones was screened with ELISA. anti-His mAbs reacted with both proteins in the same experiment. we evaluated the specificity of mAbs in mammalian cells. pEGFPC1 and pEGFPC1-IRAS plasmids were separately transfected into HEK293 cells. whole cell extracts derived from HEK293 cells were transfected with pEGFPC1-IRAS and the control vector pEGFPC1 plasmid. pEGFPC1-IRAS protein localization was tested by fluorescence confocal microscopy after 48 hours transfection. mAbs DA041, DD015, BE073, BA022, and AH021 were probed with anti-GFP antibody. the punctate fluorescence patterns appeared to be unique to the mAbs DA041, DD015, and BE073. we also detected the endogenous IRAS protein with monoclonal antibody DA041 in PC12 cells. these results suggest that the 3 mAbs specifically detect IRAS proteins by immunofluorescence, similar to immunoblotting results. the mAb DA041 and the c-myc mAb resulted in significant increases in fluorescence intensity compared to cells incubated with preimmune sera (0.01%). mAb DA041 is effective for detecting IRAS protein by flow cytometry. IRAS was selectively immunoprecipitated from cell lysates. lysates were immunoprecipitated with the c-myc mAb to confirm mAb specificity. no corresponding band was visualized when the negative control c-myc mAb was used to immunoprecipitate cell lysate of the transfectant expressing the empty PCMV-myc vector. the remaining mAbs BA022 and AH021 scored negatively. monoclonal antibody DA041 against hIRAS could not react with SNX13 by immunofluorescence assay. it was proposed that these antibodies developed here were specific to the PX domain of IRAS. the mAbs BA022 and AH021 could be used as backup reagents to safeguard against antibody-specific artifacts. the nusA protein used as a control generated the 66 kDa expected molecular weight. the recombinant protein was also confirmed with western blot using anti-His mAbs. blood was collected from the mice after multiple injections. western blot analysis of nusA-IRAS(10\u2013120aa) fusion proteins showed a 78 kDa protein band which corresponded to the purified nusA-IRAS(10\u2013120aa) protein. chimeric proteins were expressed and migrated separately at expected molecular masses of approximately 19 or 27 KDa. all 5 selected mAbs specifically recognized bacterially expressed NusA-IRAS(10\u2013120aa) proteins. only 3 mAbs recognized recombinant IRAS in mammalian cells. cell lysates were prepared 48 hours after transfection and separated by SDS-PAGE. the mAbs DA041, DD015, and BE073 were used as probes to detect a predominantly punctate cytosolic distribution as expected (panel B, F, G) however, the mAb BA022 homogenously detected the fluorescence distribution over the cytoplasm (panel N) and the mAb AH021 scored negatively (panel R). IRAS labeled with TRITC-conjugated goat antimouse antibody using IRAS mAbs as primary antibody. yellow (D, H, L, P, and T) represented overlapping green and red fluorescence. results were expressed as histograms with the DNA content on x-axis. cells were immunoprecipitated with mAb DA041 and analyzed with mAb DA041 immunoblotting after 48-hour transfection with PCMV-myc-IRAS. IRAS was selectively immunoprecipitated from cell lysates that expressed the myc-IRAS protein (approximately 175 kDa), and those which correspond to the predicted size of the full-length IRAS. immunocomplexes were analyzed by western blot with indicated antibodies. mAbs DA041, DD015, and BE073 were reactive for both immunofluorescence and immunoblotting. therefore, these mAbs were capable of recognition of native full-length IRAS proteins by immunoprecipitation. however, the mAbs BA022 and AH021 specifically recognized bacterially expressed IRAS immunogens and did not detect recombinant"}
