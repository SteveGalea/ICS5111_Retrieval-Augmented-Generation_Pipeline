{"summary": "innate immune system relies on a small subset of germline-encoded pattern recognition receptors that recognize structurally conserved microbial molecules. nucleic acids (NAs) are composed of the same basic building blocks. ability to identify the origin of DNA and RNA is a crucial necessity for the innate immune system. nucleotide composition, naturally occurring chemical modifications, and distinct sequence motifs affect primary, secondary and tertiary structures of RNA and DNA. innate immune recognition of host NAs can facilitate onset and development of autoimmune reactions, e.g., in systemic lupus erythematosus and psoriasis. proteolytic cleavage of endosomal TLRs is necessary for downstream-signaling. processing of immature TLRs by cleavage only at their final place of destination. human and mouse TLR9 favor the two different sequence motifs. ssRNA is sensed by TLR7 and TLR8 in humans. in mice TLR7 and TLR13 are the relevant receptors. both receptors have been shown to sense ssRNA and small chemical imidazoquinoline components. s is involved in RNA sensing by binding a single guanosine or uridine. recognition of ssRNA differs between mice and humans. TLR13 is unique among other RNA-sensing receptors as it exclusively senses a highly conserved sequence within the 23S ribosomal RNA of bacteria. ssRNA, especially prokaryotic mRNA, is such an example and is recognized by TLR7 and TLR8 within pDCs and monocytes. recognition of foreign RNA in the cytosol is generally considered as hallmark of viral infection and replication. however, autophagy enables sensing of cytosolic PAMPs in the endosome. the self-cleavage of caspase-1 with subsequent generation of bioactive IL-1 induces a specific cytokine profile. only RNA-activated human and porcine antigen presenting cells were able to generate a downstream cytokine response. RNA recognition by the innate immune system also affects secondary stimulation of adaptive immunity. inflammatory condition similar to sterile sepsis suggests autophagy plays a dual role for cytokine signaling in vivo. inflammatory condition similar to sterile sepsis suggests autophagy plays a dual role for cytokine signaling in vivo. recognition of endogenous NAs is reliably prevented. a biallelic loss-of-function mutation in the DNASE2 gene causes autoinflammatory state and enhanced type I interferon signaling in humans. however, a biallelic loss-of-function mutation in the DNASE2 gene causes autoinflammatory state and enhanced type I interferon signaling in humans. mouse studies suggested the responsibility of macrophages for autoinflammatory state and arthritis symptoms. s2U and modifications impeded stimulation of TLR7 and 8. modifications also inhibited secretion of TNF and IL-12 from monocyte-derived dendritic cells. a dual receptor recognizing guanosine and ssRNA would suggest that RNA has to be degraded prior to interaction with TLR7/8. this might be a molecular point of action for RNA modifications. mRNA modification was shown to further decrease stimulation of innate immunity. adenosine deaminases acting on RNA are the most common modification affecting innate sensing. adenosine deamination is the most common modification affecting innate sensing. adenosine deamination is the most common modification affecting innate sensing. ADAR1 p150 editing in murine fibroblasts was suggested to act as feedback suppressor mechanism during innate immune responses. interferons increased editing, thereby limiting recognition of self-RNAs with double-stranded portions. however, the exact mechanism of action is not entirely known. opeptide repeats (IFIT) resulting in loss of pathogenicity in a mutant absent of 2\u2019-O-methyltransferase activity. NS5 protein of flaviviruses might also act as methyltransferase for internal adenosines thus extending the amount of modified nucleotides and eventually reducing immunostimulation. ribose 2\u2019-O-methylation is known to act as a dominant inhibitor on TLR7 and TLR8. it means 2\u2019-O-methylation of only a proportion of RNAs is sufficient to abrogate immune stimulation of the entire RNA preparation. it was suggested that 2\u2019-O-methylated RNA might displace non-methylated stimulatory RNA without inducing the change in TLR7 conformation. trmH is responsible for 2\u2019-O-methylation of conserved guanosines at position 18 (Gm18) in the D-loop of tRNAs. type I trmH methylates all tRNA species at G18, whereas type II trmH modifies a subset of tRNA isoacceptors. tRNA 2\u2019-O-methylation is one of the most abundant posttranscriptional modifications within e dsRNA-homopolymers containing 2\u2019-O-methylation induced less type I IFN. dsRNA-homopolymers containing 2\u2019-O-methylation induced less type I IFN. authors identified 2\u2019-O-methylated RNA as TLR7 antagonist. early data with 2\u2019O-methylation made only use of synthetic RNA. however, 2\u2019-O-methylation is naturally occurring at significantly higher abundance in eukaryotic as compared to prokaryotic (and mitochondrial) RNA. study of 2\u2019-O-methylated nucleotides also considering the nucleobase downstream of the modification. elucidated a functional (DmR) motif (D = all but C; R = purine) which inhibited TLR7 stimulation in cis. however, a sequence motif inhibiting TLR8 stimulation was pending. tRNALys3 was described as non-stimulatory on the innate immune system without exhibiting previously described 2\u2019-O-methylation at position 18. a double-methylation of uridine to 2\u2019-O-methyl thymidine at position 54 of human tRNA was identified as sufficient to partially silence immunity of RNA without dominant inhibition of TLR7. data suggest a significant influence of the nucleobase on dominant inhibition of TLR7 and TLR8. increasing nucleotide structure shifts 2\u2019-O-methylated immune stimulatory nucleotides (cytidine) towards immune antagonistic nucleotides. methylated RNA is due to interference a bindings site 2 within TLR7/8 as this site is not occupied by small molecule ligands. mutations in the human FTSJ1 gene cause lack of 2\u2019-O-methylation of C32 and G34 of human tRNAs. mutations in the human FTSJ1 gene cause lack of 2\u2019-O-methylation of C32 and G34 of human tRNAs. rheumatic disease-associated inflammatory response linked to recognition of endogenous nucleic acids like RNA. effects of anti-fibrillarin antibodies on extend of rRNA methylation has not yet been investigated. decrease in 2\u2019-O-methylation within rRNA might affect RNA sensing by TLR7 and TLR8. in human immune cells like pDCs or monocytes, self-recognition of host RNA is facilitated by inappropriate ribose methylation. the ability to posttranscriptionally modify certain nucleotides within DNA and RNA has been shown to have an additional function beside structural needs and epigenetics."}
