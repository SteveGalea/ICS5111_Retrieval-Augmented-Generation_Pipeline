{"summary": "several respiratory diseases are leading causes of death and form a burden for many more (1). 235 million people suffer from asthma (2), and lung cancer is a top cause for cancer-related death (3). proteolytic enzymes may be involved or could serve as potential biomarkers. many substrates have already been identified for DPP4. these include neuropeptides, chemokines and the incretin hormones. the latter are well-known, since DPP4-inhibitors are clinically used to treat type 2 diabetes. a knock-in proved to be lethal, with neonates dying within 8\u201324 hours after birth. analysis of gene expression patterns of these knock-in mice showed differential expression of genes involved in cell growth, innate immunity and metabolic pathways. DPP8 and 9 enzymes are widely expressed and can be found in cells of the immune system, epithelia, endothelia, brain, reproductive organs and others (24,53,59-61). soluble form of FAP can be found in the blood (63), but sources of circulating FAP are currently not known. the exact role of FAP appears to be highly dependent on the tumor microenvironment and cancer type (80). PREP PREP, also called prolyl endopeptidase, was discovered in 1971 as an oxytocin cleaving enzyme in the uterus (85), but has endopeptidase activity only. glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (100), growth-associated protein 43 (101,102) and tubulin (90,103) overlapping substrate specificities complicate interpretation of enzymatic activity assays in situ or in vitro. literature was searched for reports on the expression of each individual enzyme in the human lung in health and disease. search terms included asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer, fibrosis, ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) and pneumonia. information in this review is up-to-date until October 2016. adenosine deaminase (35,36), caveolin-1 (37), mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor II receptor (38,39), the sodium hydrogen exchanger type 3 (40) and proteins of the extracellular matrix (41,42) the last interaction might be indirect (43,44) a proteomics study identified several substrates, including calreticulin and adenylate kinase 2, providing possible leads into the functional role of DPP8 and DPP9. other studies have implied that DPP9 is involved in cell migration, apoptosis and cell adhesion (53-56) the known substrate repertoire of FAP is limited. it includes 2-antiplasmin and denatured collagen. it is believed that FAP is largely absent from healthy adult tissues. however, recent reports show FAP under normal conditions. all short peptides (up to 30 amino acids long) that contain a proline are possible substrates of PREP. PREP is involved in the generation of proline-glycine-proline (PGP) from collagen fragments. it also plays a role in neutrophilic inflammation (96) overlapping substrate specificities complicate interpretation of enzymatic activity assays in situ or in vitro. this is certainly the case with the DPPs, and with FAP and PREP, when these enzymes are assayed with synthetic substrates. the distribution of DPP4 in the human respiratory tract was investigated using immunohistochemistry (antibody clone 11D7). in the epithelium of nasal mucosa and conducting airways, DPP4 was rarely observed. the endothelium of pulmonary vessels also had DPP4 staining, decreasing in staining intensity from lymphatics over venules to arterioles. DPP4 activity was lower in a bronchial epithelial cell line (BEAS-2B) than in an alveolar epithelial cell line (A549). low DPP4-like activity, most likely representing DPP8/9-activity, could be measured in the BAL fluid of DPP4-negative rats. transformed bronchial epithelial cells, the Calu-3 cell line and the A549 cells (111) however, as most cell lines originate from cancerous tissue these cells might not be representative for the corresponding primary airway epithelial cells in vivo. DPP4 has already been extensively studied in various asthma models. the same authors could not detect any differences in DPP4-activity. treatment with inhaled fluticasone propionate for 12 weeks did not alter the activity of DPP4 in BAL fluid (115). the expression of DPP9 mRNA in whole-lung samples was higher than in controls (117). bronchiolar epithelium, type I and II pneumocytes, endothelium, smooth muscle, alveolar macrophages) of normal lung and centriacinar emphysema cases were shown to be upregulated. in lung tissues of active smokers and COPD patients, PREP was highly expressed on neutrophils, macrophages and epithelial cells. the number of inflammatory cells and PREP expression was lower in lung tissues from ex-smokers (89). this data are in line with a study in mice (120). aeruginosa showed more exosomes and increased PREP protein expression (121). the most common types of NSCLC are adenocarcinoma, large cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma (122,123) the fluorescence intensity was lower in tumor cell lines compared to the fetal cells. a comparison between fetal and cancerous tissue might not be optimal. the relative surface activity of the fetal and A549 cells was almost 100%, indicating that DPP4 was present on the membrane. in patients with epithelioid subtype of MPM the sDPP4 levels and DPP4-activity (substrate Gly-Pro-pNA) were increased compared to patients with benign pleural diseases. other studies have shown that DPP4 protein levels and activity (measured with Gly-Pro-pNA) were higher in PE of patients with tuberculosis compared to other non-tuberculous PE. literans syndrome at time of diagnosis, compared to acute rejection, no rejection and matched samples from 3 months before the diagnosis. literans syndrome at time of diagnosis, compared to acute rejection, no rejection and matched samples from 3 months before the diagnosis. parenchyma, DPP4 was detected in type I and II cells and alveolar macrophages. endothelium of pulmonary vessels also had DPP4 staining. bronchial epithelium, smooth muscle and connective tissue were negative. low DPP4-like activity, most likely representing DPP8/9-activity, could be measured in the BAL fluid of DPP4-negative rats. in wild-type rats, DPP4 expression and activity was mainly found in lung parenchyma and less in the bronchi. the expression of DPP10, an inactive member of the DPP family, was also detected in bronchi and leukocytes. this resulted in an increase of total DPP4-like and DPP8/9-activity in BAL fluid. an increased expression and activity was detected for DPP4 in the parenchyma and for DPP8/9 in the bronchi. the gene of DPP10 was previously identified as a susceptibility marker of asthma. IL-13 stimulation of bronchial epithelial cells resulted in an increased mRNA and protein expression of DPP4 (116). a significant increase in DPP4 immunostaining was found in type I and II cells and in alveolar macrophages in the lungs of patients (105). DPP4 showed a distinct expression pattern, staining the hyperplastic alveolar lining cells that overly fibroblast foci, but not the fibroblast foci themselves. induction of pulmonary fibrosis in both bleomycin and thoracic irradiation murine models resulted in an increased lung collagen content in both models. this was not due to changes in the activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) suggesting that FAP has an anti- PREP activity was 5 times higher in patients with cystic fibrosis compared to healthy controls. mRNA, protein expression and enzymatic activity has been shown in multiple airway epithelial cells, both in cell lines and primary cells. al epithelial cells showed a lower enzymatic activity, protein and mRNA expression of DPP4 (125) edo et al. used a new fluorogenic substrate, namely 4-(Gly-Pro-hydrazido)-N-hexyl-1,8-naphthalimide, for the detection of DPP4 in their study with human fetal lung-derived, SK-MES-1 cells. two thirds of the DPP4-like activity is located intracellularly. the authors explain this by disturbances in the intracellular membrane transport system. but a possible contribution of the intracellular enzymes DPP8 and 9 cannot be neglected. other studies have also shown that DPP4 protein levels and activity were higher in PE of patients with tuberculosis compared to other non-tuberculous PE. others PREP activity has been measured with Z-Gly-Pro-sulfamethoxazole in healthy lung tissues from patients with lung carcinoma and in the BAL fluid of patients with various lung diseases. the clinically used DPP4-inhibitors were theoretically suspected to increase the risk of pneumonia based on DPP4\u2019s involvement in the immune system. however, several recent studies have not been able to identify an association (143,144) a lot of missing information on the expression of proline-specific peptidases in the healthy and diseased lung makes it interesting candidates for validation as biomarkers. the apparently differential expression of the enzymes makes them interesting candidates for validation as biomarkers."}
