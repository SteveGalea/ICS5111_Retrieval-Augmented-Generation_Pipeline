{"summary": "fixed-dose combinations (FDC) combine two or more medicines into one pill have simplified AIDS treatment protocols, facilitated patient adherence and reduced the risk of drug resistance. Vigorous generic competition has reduced medicines prices to around US$ 87 for the first-line FDC of stavudine, lamivudine and nevirapine \u2013 roughly 1% of the price a decade ago. 29 countries have committed to contribute, the majority of which are low- and middle-income. a full flight from Paris to new york raises enough to cover a year\u2019s treatment for 60 HIV-positive children. other countries are committing multi-year budgetary contributions. the patent pool initiative aims to provide patients in low and middle income countries with increased access to more appropriate and affordable medicines. the patent pool is intended to avert a \u201ctragedy of the anti-commons [5]\u201d in which people cannot make use of knowledge because of the tangle of property rights that can block them. any company that wants to use the intellectual property to produce or develop medicines can seek a license from the pool against the payment of royalties. a company might need to obtain licenses from at least three different patent holders to be able to develop, produce, export and sell an ARV FDC. an FDC of three of these drugs currently does not exist or is in limited supply. patent pool will be a voluntary mechanism, meaning success will depend on the willingness of pharmaceutical companies to participate and commit their intellectual property to the pool. the pool has the potential to provide benefits to all: pharmaceutical companies are rewarded for their investments into research and development (R&D); generic companies are able to access the intellectual property more easily and quickly; and patients in developing countries get faster access to better, more affordable treatments. a patent pool is one way of managing IP from a public health perspective. the potential and hopes for the UNITAID patent pool are high, but key details will determine whether the pool is a success. there is widespread recognition that a purely market-based system for health R&D suffers from major shortcomings. if a workable arrangement for access to intellectual property through mechanisms such as the patent pool cannot be achieved, both patients and companies stand to lose. if a workable arrangement for access to intellectual property through mechanisms such as the patent pool cannot be achieved, both patients and companies stand to lose. UNITAID has worked with the WHO HIV/AIDS Programme and the Department of Essential Medicines and Pharmaceutical Policies to draw up a list of missing essential ARVs. the next steps will be to establish a licensing agency and to work with the relevant patent owners to agree on the specific licensing terms. the patent pool could expand to respond to other diseases and health needs in developing countries."}
