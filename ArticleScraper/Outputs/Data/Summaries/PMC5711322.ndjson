{"summary": "the first tier of the LRN-B comprises 5,000 sentinel microbiology laboratories. the second tier comprises reference-level microbiology laboratories. the third tier comprises agencies such as CDC and the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases. foreign and domestic laboratories self-determine the extent of the LRN-B testing portfolio that their laboratory will implement. the CDC LRN program office and the US Department of Defense began establishing an international\u2013US CDC LRN member laboratory in south Korea. establishing a US LRN presence in south Korea enabled its use of US LRN-B procedures and reagents. critical portions of training documents were translated into Korean. they included laboratory job aids and specific laboratory procedures. Biological select agents and toxins have the potential to pose a severe threat to public, animal, or plant health. training and testing capacity building for Laboratory Response Networks in south Korea. total number of agents in testing repertoire indicates biological threat agent testing capability when laboratory procedures are used. a CDC team including members of the LRN program office, an infection prevention practitioner, a CDC poxvirus subject matter expert and a high containment laboratory manager helped develop training for safe HCL entry and exit training. on-demand technology resources include offering additional training resources to LRN-B domestic and international partners. on-demand training tools include providing integrated agent-specific, bacterial biological threat rule-out and refer testing flowcharts. these tools were first used in the 2016 Conventional Methods training classes. they are currently being translated into Korean. the content of the proficiency assessments is expanding to include content for the rapid presumptive procedures and other agent-specific training for participating LRN laboratories."}
