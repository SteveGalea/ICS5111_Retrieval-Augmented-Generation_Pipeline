{"summary": "group C viruses are antigenically characterized into the genus Orthobunyavirus, order Bunyavirales. this name is historically based on their serological characteristics. it makes them distinct from members of group A (Alphaviruses genus of the family Togaviridae) and group B (Flavivirus genus of the family Flaviviridae) antigenic groups. strains used in this study were propagated into VERO cells (ATCC\u00ae CCL-81TM) the infected cells were incubated for 3 to 5 days until visualization of viral cytopathic effect. RNA extraction, construction of RNA library, sequence assembly and RACE assay Viral RNAs were extracted from the supernatant of infected VERO cells using the PureLink Viral RNA Mini Kit (Invitrogen, USA) the strands of the RNA synthesis were performed using the kit cDNA Synthesis System and 400 M Roche \u201crandom\u201d Primer. sequences for terminal untranslated regions (UTRs) were determined by 5\u2019/3\u2019 rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) sequencing. genomes were evaluated regarding it sizes, annotations of putative open reading frame (ORF), 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 non-coding regions (NCRs) and conserved motifs with Geneious 9.1.2 (Biomatters, New Zealand) the phylogenetic trees were visualized using the FigTree software v.1.4.2. the nucleotides and amino acid distances among viruses of Group C were estimated with segment S, M, and L using the p-distance values. apeu virus APEUV BeAn848 10/14/1955 Cebus apella Oriboca Forest, Par\u00e1 State, Brazil MG029269 to MG029271 Itaqui virus ITQV BeAn12797 09/02/1959 Sentinel mouse Bel\u00e9m, Par\u00e1 State, Brazil MG029275 to MG029277 Nepuyo virus NEPV BeAn10709 1959 Sentinel mouse Brazil MG029287 to MG02 the cDNAs were prepared for HTS on a GS FLX+ pyrosequencer. sequences for terminal untranslated regions (UTRs) were determined by 5\u2019/3\u2019 rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) sequencing (S1 Table) the phylogenies were inferred by IQ-TREE version 1.4.3 software using the best-fit model based on Bayesian Information Criterion. the GTR+I+G4 nucleotide substitution model was used to all RNA segments, and the GTR+I+G4 nucleotide substitution model was used to all RNA segments. the complete SRNA segments of Group C viruses ranged from 1,003 to 1,111 nucleotides (nt) and presents the open reading frame (ORF) of the nucleocapsid (N) protein. the second ORF in the S segment in these viruses encodes a putative non-structural protein (NSs) the NSs protein is common in most orthobunyaviruses that have been isolated from vertebrates. the complete MRNA segments ranged from 4,534 to 4,613 nt in length. the complete MRNA segments encoded the glycoprotein precursor (GPC) ranging from 1,428 to 1,435 aa in length (159.94 to 161.87 kDa) the GPC is proteolytically cleaved to yield two structural glycoproteins. the complete LRNA segments ranged from 6,907 to 6,979 nt in length, with an ORF that encodes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of 2,248 aa. the unique exception is Nepuyo virus strain BeAn 10709 with a RdRp of 2,249 aa. viruses that we have been sequenced the complete coding sequences shared higher nucleotide identify with partial genomes. we did not observe any amino acid substitutions in the nucleoprotein sequence of the viruses that were submitted to the re-sequencing protocol. group C viruses were clustered in a unique monophyletic clade with different topologies for each segment. the clade B was split into two subclades: subclade Ib, represented by CARV strains, ITQV, Itaya (ITYV) strain IQT9646 and FSL2923 and MADV and the subclade IIIb with Bruconha virus (BRUV) phylogeny of the M segment and serological classification occurs because the M segment encodes the glycoproteins, which are the primary antigenic determinants recognized by the neutralization and hemagglutination inhibition tests. this fact has been shown to be involved in virus emergence and interspecies transmission, which include Schmallenberg and Oropouche virus. the first reassortment event was identified in APEUV strain BeAn848. it contains S and L segments from MTBV strain BeAn15 and an M segment. the other reassortment event was observed in ORIV strain BeAn17. the other reassortment event was observed in ORIV strain BeAn17. reassortments in ITYV identified in 1999 have S and L segments from Caraparu virus and a unique M segment. however, we did not find any evidence to support this phenomenon. additional studies, as well as other strains of Group C viruses, may help clarify this point. segment in these viruses encodes a putative non-structural protein (NSs) the ORF to NSs gene starts at an ATG codon -38 nucleotides downstream of the N ORF start codon, which potentially encodes an NSs protein of 318 nt (105 aa) the NSs protein is common in most orthobunyaviruses that have been isolated from vertebrates. complete MRNA segments ranged from 4,534 to 4,613 nt in length. the GPC is proteolytically cleaved to yield two structural glycoproteins, Gn (204 to 211 aa and 34.01 to 35.13 kDa) and a nonstructural protein (NSm) with 281 or 282 nt (24.99 to 26.27 kDa) the unique exception is Nepuyo virus strain BeAn 10709 with a RdRp of 2,249 aa. the protein contains the conserved polymerase activity domains consisting of pre-Motif A and Motifs A through E in position 951 to 1230 aa. these domains are highly conserved in negative sense RNA viral polymerases and are directly involved in the polymerase function activity. MTBV strain BeAn15 (Q335R); (L728Q); (Q1073K) and (K1345R) on RdRp and (G456R and D626N) in GPC. we did not observe any amino acid substitutions in the nucleoprotein sequence of the viruses that were submitted to the re-sequencing protocol. clade A and B present two major clades, namely of clade A and B. clade Ia was subdivided in three: subclade IIa, with MTBV and APEUV; subclade IIIa comprised by NEPV, Gumbo Limbo (GLV) topology of the ML tree for the M segment reveals four phylogenetic groups that were well supported (bootstrap > 80%) the serological classification occurs because the M segment encodes the glycoproteins, which are the primary antigenic determinants recognized by the neutralization and hemagglutination inhibition tests. this fact has been shown to be involved in virus emergence and interspecies transmission, which include Schmallenberg and Oropouche virus [31\u201333]. UV strain BeAn848 contains S and L segments from MTBV strain BeAn15. ITQV strain BeAn 12797 has S and L segments from CARV strain BeAn3994. reassortments occur between different viral species, as the Apeu virus. reassortments were previously reported to be reassortments. but we did not find any evidence to support this phenomenon. additional studies may help clarify this point. pairwise distance based on alignment of amino acids sequences of Group C viruses with (d) Nucleoprotein (e) Glycoprotein precursor and (f) RNA-dependent RNA polymerase."}
