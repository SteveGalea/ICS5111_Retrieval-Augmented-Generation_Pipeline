{"summary": "up to 3 female horses at a time were housed in single pens under BSL-4 conditions meeting the Victorian Bureau of animal welfare code of practice for the welfare of horses. rooms temperature was maintained at 22\u00b0C with 15 air changes/h; humidity ranged from 40% to 60%. vaccinated horses were euthanized electively on day 7, 8, or 9 after challenge. animals were immobilized by intramuscular injection of ketamine hydrochloride and medetomidine (30 g/kg) the effects of medetomidine were reversed by intramuscular injection of atipemazole (15 g/kg) animal studies were endorsed by the CSIRO animal health laboratory and/or Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. Vaccine formulations for initial efficacy studies in target species were formulated with 50 g of affinity-purified sG glycoprotein. all subsequent vaccines were formulated with clarified CHO cell culture supernatant that was then gamma irradiated. the change of the expression system from 293F cells to CHO cells was driven by the need for higher antigen yields. horses V1\u2013V7 were challenged 28 days after the second vaccination. horses V8\u2013V10 were challenged 194 days after the second vaccination. horses V8\u2013V10 were selected from 29 vaccinated horses in a larger field efficacy and safety study. samples were collected in duplicate into 1 mL of phosphate-buffered saline for virus isolation or into 800 L of MagMax Lysis/Binding Solution (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) for RNA extraction. 100 L of fluid was added to 260 L of the lysis/binding solution. vaccinated horses were euthanized electively on day 7, 8, or 9 after challenge. unvaccinated horses were euthanized upon reaching a predetermined humane endpoint (6\u20139 days after vaccination) the humane end point was defined as fever for up to 48 h. work using gamma-irradiated HeVsG glycoprotein produced in 293F human embryonic kidney cells was done under Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service in vivo permit number 2012/012. all clinical trials were conducted under the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority research permits PER 7250, PER 13169, PER 13247, and PER 13418. horse identification Hendra virus soluble G glycoprotein specification Challenge, days after vaccination Viral infectivity control Source Irradiation Dose, g Species No. 1 Horse 1 V1 293F HEK No 100 21 V2 293F HEK No 100 21 2 Guinea pig 4 V3 293F HEK No 50 21 V4 293F HEK No 50 21 3 Ferret 2 V6 CHO Yes 100 21 4 Ferret 2 V8 CHO Yes 100 a pathogenicity control for the inoculum was provided by 1 horse (test 1), 4 guinea pigs (test 2), 2 ferrets (test 3), and 2 ferrets (test 4) guinea pigs and ferrets each received 50,000 50% tissue culture infectious doses of the same virus preparation that was used in the horses. 4 unvaccinated horses were tested against the clinical, virologic, and pathologic features of HeV infection. the horse became clinically depressed, its temperature and heart rate continued to rise, and it was euthanized. histologic examination revealed systemic vasculitis affecting the lung. eosin staining shows systemic vasculitis affecting the lung. RNA from this fourth control horse was detected in nasal swabs. virus was not reisolated from any sample collected before postmortem examination. 0.3 0.2 1.4 1.6 1.4 1.7 Oral swab 0.1 1.3 1.3 2 Blood 0.5 2.6 3.0 Urine 0.3 1.7 Feces 0.05 2.0 Nasal swab 1.2 2.0 1.6 1.6 3.5 2.5 Oral swab 0.4 1.5 3 Blood 1.5 2.8 2.9 3.4 Urine 1.8 1.7 3.0 Feces 1.5 1.7 2.1 Nasal swab 1.7 2.5 1.2 2.4 3.0 3.8 dpc Genome detection, sample, no. 1 Horse 1/1 V1 512, 1,024 8 V2 512, 1,024 9 2 Guinea pig 1/4 V3 2,048, 4,096 7 V4 128, 256 8 V5 >4,096, >4,096 9 3 Ferret 2/2 V6 >4,096, >4,096 7 V7 >4,096, >4,096 8 4 Ferret 2/2 V8 32, 32 7 V9 16, 32 8 2\u2013 horses were immunized with HeVsG glycoprotein and then exposed to an otherwise lethal dose of HeV. each study included a pathogenicity control for the virus inoculum. guinea pigs or ferrets were used as pathogenicity controls to maximize the number of vaccinated horses that could be accommodated in the facility. titers before HeV challenge ranged from 128/256 to >4,096 for horses V1\u2013V7 when challenged 21 days after the second vaccination. at the time of euthanasia, no rise in antibody titer was detected in any vaccinated horse following exposure to HeV. 2 doses of a commercially formulated HeVsG glycoprotein subunit\u2013based vaccine prevented infection in 7 of 7 horses exposed to HeV at least 21 days after the second vaccine dose. similar results were obtained for 2 of 3 horses exposed to HeV 6 months after vaccination. lenge antibody titers of 16 or 32 were similarly protected from clinical illness. it is possible that animals with even lower titers will have epidemiologically meaningful protection against HeV exposure occurring in the field. initial uptake of the HeVsG glycoprotein subunit\u2013based vaccine was strongest in the area with the highest perceived risk for HeV infection. the vaccine against HeV (Equivac HeV) is a commercially deployed vaccine developed against a BSL-4 agent. it is the only licensed treatment for henipavirus infection. the vaccine is expected to provide a substantial health benefit to humans."}
