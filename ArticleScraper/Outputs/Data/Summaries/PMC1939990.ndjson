{"summary": "GHQ-12 was scored by binary, chronic and Likert scoring method. recovery in the scale for the factor'social dysfunction' was remarkably impaired compared with that of the factor 'dysphoria' recovery in the scale for the factor'social dysfunction' was remarkably impaired. the earthquake occurred on October 23, 2004 in the Niigata-Chuetsu region of japan. more than 4,500 people were injured and 120,000 houses were destroyed. at five months after the earthquake, 9,600 people who had lost their houses were living in temporary housing. the proportions of subjects suffering psychological distress were estimated by using cutoff points for GHQ scores as recommended [19]. we performed confirmatory factor analysis in order to find the most fitted model. the average GHQ-12 score was 3.6 3.6 in binary method, 6.8 2.7 in chronic method and 15.3 5.3 in Likert method. the proportions of subjects who were considered to be suffering psychological distress were 33.1% in binary method, 53.3% in chronic method and 39.3% in Likert method. the two-factor model found by exploratory factor analysis showed more favorable fitting measures than those of the one-factor model and models consisting of three or more factors. the two-factor model using chronic method showed fitting measures superior to those of binary method and Likert method (Table 2). age of subjects was associated with total GHQ scores as well as lower scale points for factor I. lower scale points for factor I tended to increase with increase in age of subjects, whereas factor II tended to decrease. the relationship between age of subjects and GHQ scores is shown as mean and standard deviation values. the data obtained two years after the earthquake (second survey) are shown with the data obtained five months after the earthquake (first survey) a model consisting of the two factors showed a high level of goodness-of-fit in a survey of subjects who had experienced the Niigata-Chuetsu earthquake at five months after the earthquake. the proposed two-factor model also showed a good fit to the results of the survey of subjects two years after the earthquake. there has been debate as to whether GHQ is a uni-dimensional or multi-dimensional measure. cao et al. reported that the proportion of subjects with psychological distress was higher than non-exposed controls at five months after the 1988 Yun Nan Earthquake using the Chinese version of GHQ-28 [10] Carr et al. studied the time course of psychological distress over a period of two years after the 1989 Newcastle Earthquake. HK, MK, TE, MI, HH and NF contributed to acquisition of data. all authors read and approved the final manuscript."}
