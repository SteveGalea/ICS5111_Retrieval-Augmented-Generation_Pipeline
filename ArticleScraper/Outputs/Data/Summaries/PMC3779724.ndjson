PE is also an important constituent in cell membranes because it is the predominant phospholipid conjugated to LC3 marking an essential step of autophagosome formation. biotinylated PE to allow liposome purification over monomeric avidin-functionalized columns. we measured the percentage of unquenched, internalized phospholipid. lipid mixtures showed a substantial level of internalized fluorescent lipid. liposomes of lipid compositions 1:1:1, 3:1:2 and 3:2:1 were examined by cryoelectron microscopy. hydration of the lipid films of each mixture resulted in mostly unilamellar liposomes with a low background of double-membraned and multilamellar liposomes. we presume that the remaining lipids form small amorphous aggregates. percentage of single-, double-, and multimembraned liposomes was reduced from 60 to 30%. morphology of double-membraned liposomes formed in absence of 3AB protein differed. a few vesicles formed horseshoe structures, potential intermediates in the formation of double-membraned liposomes by invagination. quantitation of the numbers of liposomes of single-, double-, and multilamellar topology in the absence and presence of 3AB protein is shown. asterisk denotes a statistically significant difference. 3AB protein induced the formation of double-membraned structures. a single-membraned vesicle that is in the process of engulfing another vesicle will produce a double-membraned vesicle. a single-membraned vesicle that is in the process of engulfing another vesicle will produce a smaller liposome by a larger one. the 0o and 45o tilt images of four representative 3AB proteoliposomes show that the inner membranes of all four structures remained confined by the outer membranes. three of the four tilted images reveal a transformation of the inner membrane into a crescent shape. such structures are potential intermediates of double-membrane formation orchestrated by poliovirus 3AB protein. dilution method reconstituted 3AB proteoliposomes by mixing detergent-suspended 3AB with mixed micelles of lipid and detergent at a protein-to-lipid ratio of 1:25, followed by removal of the -octylglucoside detergent by dialysis. liposomes generated upon dialysis in the absence of protein were single-membraned and ranged from 21\u2013352 nm in diameter. changes in morphology upon liposome formation in the presence of 3AB are quantified in Fig. 4F. changes in vesicle diameter of the unilamellar, double-membraned and multilamellar liposomes are shown in Fig. 4F. data show significant statistical differences for single-, double-, and multimembraned vesicles. the effect of 3AB transduction on intracellular membranes was achieved using a protein transduction reagent (PULSin; Polyplus Transfection) cytoplasmic (A) and perinuclear regions (B) of HeLa cells transduced with inactivated 3AB protein. cytoplasmic (C) and perinuclear regions (D) of HeLa cells transduced with purified 3AB protein increased significantly (p = 0.008) from 1.2 (1.3) to 3.1 ( 2.3) invaginations/field. the anionic phospholipid PS is entirely localized to the inner leaflet of cellular membranes. it facilitates the membrane association of proteins containing cationic motifs. the last ratio was chosen because it has been used previously to prepare poliovirus 3AB-containing proteoliposomes. lipid mixtures showed a substantial level of internalized fluorescent lipid. 58, 48, and 50% of the lipids in the mixture were present in topologically closed liposomes. however, lipid mixtures composed of 4:1:1 and 19:1:0 PC:PE:PS resulted in only 19 and 12% internalized lipid. hydration of the lipid films of each mixture resulted in mostly unilamellar liposomes with a low background of double-membraned and multilamellar liposomes. the resulting populations revealed that the 3:2:1 PC:PE:PS ratio resulted in the highest percentage of single-membraned vesicles. a few vesicles formed horseshoe structures, potential intermediates in the formation of double-membraned liposomes by invagination. poliovirus 3AB protein can transform membranes from a single- to a double-membraned topology. this effect was not observed when the poliovirus polymerase protein 3Dpol was added to liposomes. the size distribution of single-, double-, and multimembraned liposomes spanned a smaller range (49\u2013232 nm) compared with liposomes that lacked protein (32\u2013350 nm) the decrease of the population of large single-membraned vesicles upon 3AB incubation was accompanied by the increase in double-membraned vesicles. three of the four tilted images reveal a transformation of the inner membrane into a crescent shape. a single-membraned vesicle that is in the process of engulfing another vesicle will produce a tilt series of images in which the \u201cinner membrane\u201d can shift outside of the outer membrane boundary. the outer membranes of all four structures remained confined by the outer membranes. s of double-membraned vesicles orchestrated by poliovirus 3AB protein. an electron beam coming from above the virtual vesicle would generate the two-dimensional projection shown in the 0o image in the right panel. modeled vesicle was rotated 0o, 30o, and 45o around a horizontal tilt axis. liposomes generated upon dialysis in the absence of protein were single-membraned and ranged from 21\u2013352 nm in diameter. liposomes formed in the presence of 3AB were smaller and displayed a more restricted size range, from 18\u2013130 nm in diameter. poliovirus 3AB protein induces the formation of double-membraned vesicles de novo, at least in part by stabilizing increased membrane curvature. arrowhead denotes the position of liposomes in the gradient at the 20\u201340% sucrose interface. data show significant statistical differences for single-, double-, and multimembraned vesicles. we transduced purified 3AB protein directly rather than the more toxic procedure of expressing 3AB from plasmids. direct transduction was accomplished using a protein transduction reagent (PULSin; Polyplus Transfection) the presence of 3AB protein caused the numbers of observed cytoplasmic inclusions to increase significantly (p = 0.008) from 1.2 ( 1.3) to 3.1 ( 2.3) invaginations/field. white arrows mark cytoplasmic inclusions. N, nucleus; M, representative mitochondrion. Scale bars = 500 nm. the last ratio was chosen because it has been used previously to prepare poliovirus 3AB-containing proteoliposomes (25). the purity of 3AB is shown by gel electrophoresis in Fig. 1B. each liposome mixture contained 5 molar percent carboxyfluorescein-labeled PE to facilitate liposome quantitation. 3AB protein reconstituted most efficiently into liposomes composed of 1:1:1, 3:1:2 and 3:2:1 by cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) lipid ratio resulted in only 19 and 12% internalized lipids. purified poliovirus 3AB protein induces the formation of double-membraned liposomes. a few vesicles formed horseshoe structures, potential intermediates in the formation of double-membraned liposomes by invagination. a few vesicles formed horseshoe structures, suggesting continuity with the outer bilayer. poliovirus 3AB protein can transform membranes from a single- to a double-membraned topology. this effect was not observed when the poliovirus polymerase protein 3Dpol was added to liposomes. asterisk denotes a statistically significant difference. to test this hypothesis, we measured the size distribution of single-, double-, and multimembraned liposomes in each population. the sizes of single-membraned vesicles that had been incubated with 3AB protein spanned a smaller range (49\u2013232 nm) compared with liposomes that lacked protein (32\u2013350 nm) a single-membraned vesicle that is in the process of engulfing another vesicle will produce a tilt series of images in which the inner membrane can shift outside of the outer membrane boundary. a single-membraned vesicle that is in the process of engulfing another vesicle will produce a tilt series of images in which the inner membrane can shift outside of the outer membrane. four proteoliposomes that contained 3AB were rotated 0o and 45o around a tilt axis perpendicular to the electron beam. the modeled vesicle was rotated 0o, 30o, and 45o around a horizontal tilt axis. the corresponding two-dimensional projections are shown in the right panel. liposomes were observed in the absence of 3AB protein. most liposomes generated upon dialysis ranged from 21\u2013352 nm in diameter. poliovirus 3AB protein induces the formation of double-membraned vesicles de novo. arrowhead denotes the position of liposomes in the gradient at the 20\u201340% sucrose interface. fractions obtained from the indicated sucrose gradient position were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining to detect poliovirus 3AB. as a control mock transduction, heat-inactivated 3AB was transduced into HeLa cells using PULSin. the presence of 3AB caused the numbers of observed cytoplasmic inclusions to increase significantly (p = 0.008) from 1.2 (1.3) to 3.1 ( 2.3) invaginations/field. we developed a synthetic model membrane system to determine the potential contribution of poliovirus 3AB protein to membrane rearrangement during poliovirus infection. poliovirus 3AB protein is a major factor in membrane remodeling because it is the interplay between lipids and proteins that determine how membranes are shaped. each liposome mixture contained 5 molar percent carboxyfluorescein-labeled PE to facilitate liposome quantitation and 0.2 molar percent biotinylated PE to allow liposome purification over monomeric avidin-functionalized columns. we first investigated which phospholipid composition was most suitable for the formation of topologically closed liposomes. however, lipid mixtures composed of 4:1:1 and 19:1:0 PC:PE:PS resulted in 3AB protein was diluted below the critical micellular concentration of the IGEPAL CA-630 detergent. 3AB protein reconstituted most efficiently into liposomes composed of 1:1:1 and 19:1:0 PC:PE:PS lipid ratios. hydration of the lipid films of each mixture resulted in mostly unilamellar liposomes with a low background of double-membraned and multilamellar liposomes. liposomes lacking and containing poliovirus 3AB protein were incubated with synthetic liposomes. morphology of the double-membraned vesicles formed in the absence of 3AB protein differed. poliovirus 3AB protein can transform membranes from a single to a double-membraned topology. Arrows indicate vesicles that are enlarged 2.5 in the inset. asterisk denotes a statistically significant difference. lacked protein (32\u2013350 nm) according to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (p 0.1 as determined by a D-value of 0.17 when Dp = 0.1 = 0.16 and Dp = 0.05 = 0.21) the decrease of the population of large single-membraned vesicles upon 3AB incubation was followed by the increase in double-membraned vesicles. a single-membraned vesicle that is in the process of engulfing another vesicle will produce a tilt series of images in which the \u201cinner membrane\u201d can shift outside of the outer membrane boundary. three of the four tilted images reveal a transformation of the inner membrane into a crescent shape, arguing that these structures contained invaginations. 3AB induction of double-membraned liposomes from preformed liposomes was quite evident. the amount of 3AB protein present, approximately one protein for every 100 lipid molecules, was limited by the dilution method used to increase the ratio of 3AB protein to lipid. a majority of the protein comigrated with lipids following reconstitution. liposomes formed in the presence of 3AB were smaller and displayed a more restricted size range, from 18\u2013130 nm in diameter. the relative amounts of double-membraned liposomes were greatly increased in the presence of 3AB. changes in morphology upon liposome formation in the presence of 3AB reduced the size and frequency of unilamellar samples. double-membraned vesicles are enlarged 2-fold in the right panel. white dots mark the presumed directionality of the membrane invagination. asterisk denotes a statistically significant difference. in mock-transduced cells, vesicular structures near the plasma membrane were occasionally observed. this effect was quantitated by an increase in the number of observed cytoplasmic inclusions from 1.2 ( 1.3) invaginations/field in mock-transduced cells to 3.1 ( 2.3) invaginations/field in 3AB-transduced cells. a single protein such as 3AB induces the formation of double-membraned structures via the invagination of larger single-membraned liposomes. this process resembles the invagination of small vesicles into liposomes demonstrated for the ESCRT I and II complexes. 3AB protein dimers displace lipids in the outer leaflet, generating a localized deformation of the bilayer. this localized deformation leads to lateral crowding and an imbalance in the leaflets of the bilayer, stabilizing curvature required for invagination. poliovirus protein 3AB is sufficient to induce the formation of double-membraned liposomes. the 2BC protein generates single-membraned vesicles, which are likely intermediates in poliovirus-induced double membrane formation. lipidated LC3 protein can, in isolation, induce membrane fusion. atg17-Atg31-Atg29 complex displays a curved double crescent that preferentially binds membranes with a distinct curvature (60) this complex is tethered to membranes by Atg1, whose mammalian homolog ULK1 is predicted to contain a long, intrinsically disordered domain (52)"}
