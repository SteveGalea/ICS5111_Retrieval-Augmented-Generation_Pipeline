{"summary": "the fecal panel consisted of 63 samples from dogs with diarrhea and 42 samples from dogs with formed, normal brown feces. all samples were kept at \u201320\u00b0C until processed. nucleic acid was extracted by using the QIAamp viral RNA mini kit. an 3.3-kb fragment from the RdRp region in ORF1 to the poly-A tail was generated by long-template RT-PCR. a 3,357-nt sequence including partial ORF1, full-length ORF2 and ORF3, and the 3\u2032 end noncoding region from the Viseu strain was obtained. all 105 nucleic acid extracts also tested by RT-PCR for the recently reported canine NoV strain (5), canine coronavirus ine norovirus, no. (%) dogs Canine parvovirus 2, no. (%) dogs Negative, no. (%) dogs Total no. dogs Yes 25 (40) 36 (57) 32 (51) 11 (17) 63 No. 4 (9) 22 (35) 2 (5) 18 (43) 42 *Detection by reverse transcription\u2013PCR. the Viseu strain forms tentatively a novel genogroup (GVI) with strains Ca/Bari/91/2007/IT and Hu/Chiba/2004/JP. tree topology was inferred by using neighbor-joining. zoonotic transmission between dogs and humans is not new, and the close and often intimate interactions between these two species have been suggested as a major disease risk for humans."}
