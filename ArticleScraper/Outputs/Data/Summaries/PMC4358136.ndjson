{"summary": "IBV is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Coronavirus genus (1, 2). the virus infects the upper respiratory tract of chickens, spreading progressively to the digestive and urinary tracts during the later stages of the infection. there are no IBV-specific therapeutics available on the market. the PLpro of SARS CoV is known to deubiquitinate interferon regulatory transcription factor 3. this stalls its migration to the nucleus, preventing the initiation of host antiviral responses. inhibition of PLpro by small molecules is considered a viable strategy to stall the life cycle of the virus. recombinant protein production was initiated by inducing the culture with 1 mm isopropyl d-thiogalactoside for 4 h at 28 \u00b0C under shaking conditions. cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 40 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT) crystals of native IBV PLpro were obtained in a solution containing 100 mm Bis-Tris, pH 6.5, 25\u201330% polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether 2000. crystals grew to maximum dimensions of 100 50 150 m in 3 days. the only selenium atom was located and refined. the single wavelength anomalous dispersion data phases were calculated and substantially improved. a model was manually built into the modified experimental electron density using Coot (29).

Fractions containing the protein were pooled, concentrated, and loaded onto a superdex 75 gel filtration column. the selenomethionine single wavelength anomalous dispersion data set of IBV PLpro at the selenium peak wavelength was collected at the beamline BL17U1 to 1.5- resolution. a model was manually built into the modified experimental electron density using Coot (29) and further refined in PHENIX. the rate of hydrolysis of peptide substrates carboxybenzyl-Leu-Arg-Gly-Gly-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (Z-LRGG-AMC), carboxybenzyl-Lys-Ala-Gly-Gly-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (Z-KAGG-AMC), and carboxybenzyl-Lys-Lys-Ala-Gly-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin reaction mixtures consisted of various concentrations of peptide substrate (10\u2013160 m) suspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT. intensity of the fluorescence observed was converted to the amount of substrate hydrolyzed by comparing it with the fluorescence of known standards. RESULTS Overall Structure IBV PLpro could be overexpressed as soluble protein in E. coli. the protein was purified to homogeneity using GST affinity, ion exchange, and size exclusion chromatography steps. amino acids 173\u2013310 fold into the finger and palm domains. this region of the protein consists of mostly -strands. one ion coordinated by four cysteine residues originating from two -hairpins is located between strands 6 and 10. BV PLpro cleaves the nascent viral polypeptide between nsp2 and nsp3 as well as between nsp3 and nsp4. the corresponding loop in IBV PLpro is much shorter (Asp245\u2013Val251) and connects 11 with 12. PLpro from IBV exhibits a BL1-like loop connecting strands 11 with 12. strand 16 of the palm domain of SARS CoV PLpro is missing in IBV PLpro. a feature shared between IBV and MERS CoV PLpros is the BL1-like loop. the PLpro from IBV, SARS, and MERS CoVs has a BL1-like loop at a location similar to that observed in IBV PLpro. the PLpro from IBV, SARS, and MERS CoVs shows some differences. the side-chain guanidinium group of Arg42 of ubiquitin forms a salt bridge with the side-chain carboxylate group of Glu168 of SARS CoV PLpro. a tryptophan (Trp156) occupies the position of Glu168 in IBV PLpro, whereas an arginine is located at a similar position in MERS CoV PLpro 2. ubiquitin (UB; blue schematic) was superimposed over the structure of PLpro from IBV (red schematic) the location of the diglycine motif (G-G) with respect to the catalytic triad (shown as sticks) and BL2 is shown (inset) interaction between the catalytic residues is shown by dashed lines. pro could degrade Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chains but not linear ubiquitin chains. protease from IBV showed a preference for Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains. oligomers such as triubiquitin, diubiquitin, and monoubiquitin could be degraded. the protease could not cleave linear ubiquitin under reaction conditions similar to those used for cleaving Lys48- and Lys63-linked tetraubiquitin. PLpro from IBV has been shown to cleave peptides at KAGG motifs. the catalytic efficiency of the PLpro toward KKAG-AMC was 5 times higher than that for LRGG-AMC. we then compared the catalytic efficiencies of PLpros from IBV and SARS CoVs against their preferred peptide substrates. the protein was purified to homogeneity using GST affinity, ion exchange, and size exclusion chromatography steps. the structure was solved by the selenomethionine single wavelength anomalous dispersion method. one Zn2+ ion coordinated by four cysteine residues originating from two -hairpins is located between strands 6 and 10 of the finger domain. the three long -strands of the finger domain protrude out of the protein. this facilitates formation of a hydrophobic cavity at the junction of thumb and finger domains. the corresponding loop in IBV PLpro is much shorter (Asp245\u2013Val251) and connects 11 with 12. the substrate binding site is larger in IBV PLpro than in USPs. this probably enables the enzyme to not only bind ubiquitin but also viral polyprotein and operate as a dually functional enzyme. strand 16 of the palm domain of SARS CoV PLpro is missing in IBV PLpro. the strand following this region (16) in IBV PLpro is much shorter. BL2 and the primary sequences of the PLpros corresponding to this region are shown. PLpro from IBV, SARS, and MERS CoVs has a BL1-like loop at a location similar to that observed in IBV PLpro. ubiquitin binds at a similar location, the junction of thumb, palm, and finger domains, in IBV PLpro. the nature of amino acids of PLpro from these CoVs interacting with ubiquitin is different. the side-chain carboxylate group of Glu168 of SARS CoV PLpro occupies the position of Glu168 in IBV PLpro, whereas an arginine is located at a similar position in MERS CoV PLpro 2. three hydrogen bonds are formed between ubiquitin and the PLpro from SARS CoV. PLpro was superimposed over the structure of PLpro from IBV. the location of the diglycine motif (G-G) with respect to the catalytic triad is shown. interaction between the catalytic residues is shown by dashed lines. B, comparison of amino acids of different PLpros interacting with ubiquitin (orange color) the protease from IBV showed a preference for Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains. the protease from IBV showed a preference for Lys63-linked tetraubiquitin chains. within 5 min of the incubation time, most of the oligomers were degraded to monoubiquitin. the protease could not cleave linear ubiquitin under reaction conditions similar to those used for cleaving Lys48- and Lys63-linked tetraubiquitin. we tested the catalytic ability of IBV PLpro to cleave at these motifs using peptide substrates KAGG-AMC, KKAG-AMC, and LRGG-AMC. IBV PLpro showed a catalytic efficiency of 3.23 0.72 s1 mm1 against KKAG-AMC. the catalytic efficiencies of the PLpros from IBV and SARS CoV are similar against their preferred peptide substrates. pure IBV PLpro crystallized in a number of crystallization conditions. the structure was solved by the selenomethionine single wavelength anomalous dispersion method. the final model consisting of residues 4\u2013304 was refined to 2.15- resolution. originating from two -hairpins is located between strands 6 and 10 of the finger domain. the conformation of the side chains of cysteines and the arrangement of the -hairpins are similar to those observed for members belonging to the zinc ribbon fold group. the corresponding loop in IBV PLpro is much shorter (Asp245\u2013Val251) and connects 11 with 12. this probably enables the enzyme to not only bind ubiquitin but also viral polyprotein and operate as a dually functional enzyme. the strand following this region (16) in IBV PLpro is much shorter. the location of BL2 and the primary sequences of the PLpros corresponding to this region are shown. ubiquitin binds at a similar location, the junction of thumb, palm, and finger domains, in IBV PLpro. ubiquitin binds at a similar location, the junction of thumb, palm, and finger domains, in IBV PLpro. the nature of amino acids of PLpro from these CoVs interacting with ubiquitin is different. inine is located at similar position in MERS CoV PLpro 2. three hydrogen bonds are formed between ubiquitin and the PLpro from SARS CoV. the main-chain amide nitrogen atom of Ala46 of ubiquitin hydrogen bonds with the side chain of Gln233. interaction between the catalytic residues is shown by dashed lines. B, comparison of amino acids of different PLpros interacting with ubiquitin (orange color) with corresponding amino acids of the PLpro from IBV (magenta sticks), SARS (blue sticks), and MERS (green sticks) CoVs are shown to illustrate the differences in residues of the ligand binding site of the PLpros from different sources. lower order oligomers of Lys48-linked ubiquitin seem to impose product inhibition on IBV PLpro. no cleavage of linear tetraubiquitin chains was observed even after prolonged incubation (4 h) the protease could not cleave linear ubiquitin under reaction conditions similar to those used for cleaving Lys48- and Lys63-linked tetraubiquitin. PLpro from IBV has been shown to cleave peptides at KAGG motifs. SARS CoV has been shown to cleave at LXGG sites. pro showed a catalytic efficiency of 3.23 0.72 s1 mm1 against KKAG-AMC. the catalytic efficiencies of the PLpros from IBV and SARS CoVs are similar against their preferred peptide substrates. the results further support the fact that PLpros from different sources are markedly different. the final model consisting of residues 4\u2013304 was refined to 2.15- resolution. the overall structure of the IBV PLpro consists of four distinct domains. the first 56 residues fold into a ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain. the three long strands of the finger domain protrude out of the protein. this facilitates formation of a hydrophobic cavity at the junction of thumb and finger domains. the location of BL1 and BL2 as well as the termini of the protein are marked. the substrate binding site is larger in IBV PLpro than in USPs. this probably enables the enzyme to bind ubiquitin but also viral polyprotein and operate as a dually functional enzyme. the location of BL2 and the primary sequences of the PLpros corresponding to this region are shown. the location of BL2 and the primary sequences of the PLpros corresponding to this region are shown. the location of BL2 and the primary sequences of the PLpros corresponding to this region are shown. we superimposed the structure of SARS CoV PLpro bound with ubiquitin over the structure of IBV PLpro. ubiquitin binds at a similar location, the junction of thumb, palm, and finger domains, in IBV PLpro. ubiquitin binds at a similar location, the junction of thumb, palm, and finger domains, in this model. the side chain of Gln49 forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Arg167. the equivalent residues of IBV PLpro interacting with ubiquitin, Asp223 (arginine in MERS CoV PLpro), Val199, and Asn155 (serine in MERS CoV PLpro) are all different (Fig. 3, B and C) amino acids of different PLpros interacting with ubiquitin are different from those of SARS CoV PLpro interacting with ubiquitin. similar to SARS CoV PLpro, IBV PLpro could degrade linear, Lys48- and Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains but not linear ubiquitin chains. oligomers of Lys48-linked ubiquitin seem to impose product inhibition on IBV PLpro. no cleavage of linear tetraubiquitin chains was observed even after prolonged incubation (4 h) under identical conditions. PLpro from IBV has been shown to cleave peptides at KAGG motifs. SARS CoV has been shown to cleave at LXGG (X represents any amino acid) sites. intriguingly, IBV PLpro could not cleave KAGG-AMC. catalytic efficiencies of the PLpros from IBV and SARS CoVs are similar against their preferred peptide substrates. the results further support the fact that PLpros from different sources differ in substrate specificities. the PLpro from IBV can cleave both the peptides, conceivably with different efficiencies. LRGG-AMC was degraded less efficiently when compared with KKAG-AMC. Phe151 (Leu163 in SARS CoV PLpro), Asp153 (conserved), Gly263 (conserved) and Cys265 (Tyr266 in SARS CoV PLpro) are involved in shaping the equally restricted S2 subsite, which again is specific for glycine. the residue of the peptide substrate occupying the S3 subsite is partially solvent-exposed. the location of the BL1-like loop and its proximity to the P4 residue are shown in C. the amino acids forming the S4 subsite are different in both PLpros to accommodate these very different side chains. the PLpro from IBV has BL1 located immediately adjacent to Ile290. the equivalent region in SARS CoV PLpro is rigid and made up of long -strands. differences are observed in the active site pocket, especially in the S3-S4 subsite region. differences in substrate specificities of PLpros are likely to shed more light on the roles of different PLpros. PLpros modulate immune responses, they also probably impact the virulence of viruses."}
