HeLa Rh cells were grown in minimal essential medium (catalog no. 41965-039, 500 ml/bottle; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FCS for regular subculturing and 2% FCS for antiviral assays (Integro), 5 ml of 200 mM l-glutamine, and 10 ml of 1 M HEPES (catalog no. 15630-056; Invitrogen) replicon RNA transcripts were synthesized in vitro using linearized DNA templates. replicon DNAs of PV (pRluc31), HAV (p18f-Luc) and EV71 (pACYC-EV71-RLuc) were also used as a control. cells were washed with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 0.15 ml of passive lysis buffer (Promega) after 24 h of incubation, the cells were washed with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. after freezing (80\u00b0C) and thawing (room temperature), the cell debris was removed by centrifugation (13,000 rpm, 1 min), and the the assay medium was aspirated by a plate washer (Hydroflex; Tecan), replaced with 75 l of a 5% MTS (Promega) solution in phenolsulfonphthalein-free medium (EVO200; Tecan), and incubated for 1.5 h (37\u00b0C, 5% CO2, 95 to 99% relative humidity) the absorbance (with the optical density [OD] cell control condition varying between an OD of 0.6 and an OD the EC50 represents the concentration at which 50% inhibition of viral replication would be observed. the CC50 represents the concentration at which the metabolic activity of the cells is reduced to 50% of the metabolic activity of untreated cells. all assay wells yielding a percent inhibition larger than 50 were inspected microscopically. coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) 3Cpro exhibits higher activity with the SARS-CoV Mpro substrate (SAVLQSGFRK) we also tested this substrate against EV68 3Cpro, but we could not detect any activity. the kcat and Km values of the protease using the substrate were determined as 0.54 s1 and 22.4 M, respectively. the crystal structure of the free enzyme was determined by molecular replacement using the structure of rhinovirus 3C protease (8) as a search model. all amino-acid residues were defined by electron density, including four histidines of the C-terminal His6 tag. alternative conformations were detected in the electron density for the side chains of active-site His40 and for Cys60. the distance between Cys147 S and His40 N2 is 3.3, and the one between His40 N1 and the carboxylate of Glu71 is 2.7. the imidazole of His40 is exposed to the solvent, with a distance of 6.8 between Cys147 S and his40 N2. ases occurs through a covalent tetrahedral intermediate resulting from attack of the active-site nucleophile onto the carbonyl carbon of the scissile bond. the oxyanion hole is formed by the main-chain amides of Gly145 and the active-site Cys147. in the structure of the free enzyme, the oxyanion hole is occupied by a water molecule that interacts with the first of these amides. the 3Cpro of EV71 (35), a member of the HEV-A subgroup, exhibits an RMSD of 0.74 for 174 C atoms. the relatively large distance between the enteroviruses on the one hand and hepatitis A virus (HAV) on the other is reflected in high RMS distances between the EV68 3Cpro and the proteases of these viruses. ray structures of inhibitor complexes determined to visualize ligand binding. these compounds first form a reversible encounter complex with the 3Cpro. then undergo a chemical step (nucleophilic attack by Cys147 leading to irreversible covalent-bond formation) the length of this hydrogen bond among all complexes is 2.8, indicating that this is a very stable and conserved interaction. Fig 4. Binding-mode analysis by X-ray crystallography of,-unsaturated ethyl ester inhibitors. the pocket is hydrophobic in nature, explaining the preference of the EV68 3C protease for hydrophobic residues such as Phe, Leu, or Val in position P2 of the substrates. the side chain of His40 has moved out of the catalytic site in all of the complexes. the phenylalanine side chain is ap in the structures of the complexes described here. the first inhibitors to contain P2 = Phe, SG75 (Cbz-Phe-GlnLactam-CH = CH-COOEt) and SG81 (Boc-Phe-GlnLactam-CH = CH-COOEt) span positions P3 to P1\u2032. the EV68 3Cpro has no S3 pocket and a large number of side chains in P3 are tolerated by the enzyme. however, there was an interesting correlation between the length of an aliphatic side chain in P3 and cell toxicity. a tert-butyl ester of glutamate in SG82 was slightly toxic to Huh-T7 cells. code Avg EC50 (M) SDa Echo11 (Gregory; BGM) EV71 (BRCR; RD) HRV02 (HeLa Rh) HRV29 (HeLa Rh) HRV70 (HeLa Rh) HRV85 (HeLa Rh) PV1 (Sabin; BGM) SG74 97 18 >307 57 28 >307 55 21 >307 242 >307 SG75 63 10 9.3 1.0 2.0 0.5 1.5 enviroxime, an inhibitor of the 2C NTPase of picornaviruses, can only tolerate small side chains, with alanine being the most favored one by the 3Cpro of EV68. the compound, which was an intermediate in the synthesis of other inhibitors, is both toxic and has low in vitro activity. SG85 inhibited the replication of the PV and EV71 replicons. SG85 and SG83 appear to be the most potent inhibitors of PV replicon replication (EC50 = 0.5 and 1.0) SG98 and SG75 were markedly less effective than SG98 and SG75. direct comparison of results of DNA and RNA replicon transfection in Huh-T7 cells excluded involvement of the cellular T7 RNA polymerase in inhibition. values represent means of quadruplicate wells the SD. antiviral activity of peptidic,-unsaturated esters against picornaviruses. effect of most compounds was also evaluated on replication of various picornaviruses in live-virus\u2013cell-based assays using EV71. activity against ECHO11 and PV1 was significantly less pronounced. most of the results of the cell-based assays show the same trends as those from the enzymatic assay and the replicons. coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) 3Cpro exhibits higher activity with the SARS-CoV Mpro substrate (SAVLQSGFRK) we also tested this substrate against EV68 3Cpro, but we could not detect any activity. the kcat and Km values of the protease using the substrate corresponding to the 2C3A cleavage site were determined as 0.54 s1 and 22.4 M, respectively. the crystal structure of the free enzyme was determined by molecular replacement using the structure of rhinovirus 3C protease (8) as a search model. all amino-acid residues were defined by electron density, including four histidines of the C-terminal His6 tag. alternative conformations were detected in the electron density for the side chains of active-site His40 and for Cys60. a likely reason for the occurrence of this second conformation is the low pH (4.6) of crystallization, at which part of the His40 side chains may be protonated, unable to interact with the sulfhydryl of Cys147. the catalytic triad consisting of Cys147, His40, and Glu71 is shown in stick mode. in EV68 3Cpro, the oxyanion hole is formed by the main-chain amides of Gly145 and the active-site Cys147. in the structure of the free enzyme, the oxyanion hole is occupied by a water molecule that interacts with the first of these amides. the identity between the EV68 3Cpro and the corresponding enzymes of HRV2, EV71, CVB3, EV93, and PV is 49, 53, EV71, a member of the HEV-A subgroup, exhibits an RMSD of 0.74 for 174 C atoms. the relatively large distance between the enteroviruses and hepatitis A virus is reflected in high RMS distances between the EV68 3Cpro and the proteases of these viruses. a five-membered lactam was chosen as a surrogate for the glutamine side chain amide in this position. the lactam occupies the S1 subsite, which involves residues Thr142, Arg143mc, Cys147, His161 and Gly163. the atom of his161 donates a hydrogen bond to the oxygen atom of the 3Cpro. the length of this hydrogen bond among all of the complexes is 2.8. the catalytic triad is shown in yellow, while other residues involved in the binding site are shown in pink. a stereo view of this figure can be found in the supplemental material. the EV68 3Cpro protease has moved out of the catalytic site in all of the complexes. however, the conformation of His40 corresponds to a third, totally different orientation. this conformation is stabilized by an ion-pair interaction (but not a hydrogen bond) between His40 and the carboxylate group of Glu71. the first inhibitors to contain P2 = Phe, SG75 (Cbz-Phe-GlnLactam-CH = CH-COOEt) and SG81 (Boc-Phe-GlnLactam-CH = CH-COOEt) span positions P3 to P1\u2032. SG75 exhibits significant inhibition (kobs/[I] = 3,246 M1 s1). a tert-butyl ester of glutamate in SG82 was slightly toxic to Huh-T7 cells. however, when we shortened the P3 side chain by one methylene group, the compound was nontoxic (CC50 = 295 M) EV71 (BRCR; RD) HRV02 (HeLa Rh) HRV14 (HeLa Rh) HRV29 (HeLa Rh) HRV85 (HeLa Rh) PV1 (Sabin; BGM) SG74 97 18 >307 57 28 >307 55 21 >307 242 >307 SG75 63 10 9.3 1.0 2.0 0.5 1.5 1.0 2.2 1.2 1.5 0.7 5 2 132 1 SG81 98 28 >211 enviroxime, an inhibitor of the 2C NTPase of picornaviruses, can only tolerate small side chains, with alanine being the most favored one by the 3Cpro of EV68. the compound, which was an intermediate in the synthesis of other inhibitors, is both toxic and has low in vitro activity. bs/[I] = 11,045 M1 s1] suggests that Cbz in P4 leads to stronger hydrophobic interactions. initial evaluation of the inhibitory activity of our compounds was performed at a 40 M concentration. SG84 exhibited strong cellular toxicity and was therefore not studied further. SG85 and SG83 proved more potent than SG98 and SG75. direct comparison of results of DNA and RNA replicon transfection in Huh-T7 cells excluded involvement of the cellular T7 RNA polymerase in inhibition. EV71 replication-competent replicon DNA by SG75, SG83, SG85, and SG98. effect of most compounds was also evaluated on replication of various picornaviruses in live-virus\u2013cell-based assays using EV71, multiple HRV types, and PV1. both compounds were shown to perfectly inhibit virus-induced cytopathic effects for at least one concentration in the HRV29 assay. activity against ECHO11 and PV1 was markedly less pronounced. most of the results of the cell-based assays show the same trends as those from the enzymatic assay and the replicons. enterovirus 68 shares properties with the rhinoviruses and the enteroviruses. a comparison of SG82, SG83, SG84, SG85, and SG98, which comprise residues P4 to P1\u2032, reveals variable inhibitory potency and cytotoxicity. SG85 showed the best inhibitory activity with (sub)micromolar EC50s in the PV and EV71 replicons. our next aim is to optimize our lead compound, SG85, further, to yield antivirals with improved stability, bioavailability, and activity."}
