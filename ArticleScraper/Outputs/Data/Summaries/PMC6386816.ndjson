{"summary": "engraftment often takes longer than with a standard allogeneic transplant. 179 infectious episodes occurred in 55 patients, 73 (41%) within 30 days post-UCBT. human herpesvirus 6 occurred in 28 episodes, was most common within 30 days. all adult patients 18 years of age who underwent UCBT at the 2 study centers were included in this study. medical records were reviewed to identify infectious complications from 6 months before UCBT and for 2 years after transplantation. demographic information, underlying hematologic diseases, conditioning regimens, prophylaxis, time to engraftment, episodes of infection, their treatment, and outcomes were collected. antifungal prophylaxis was initiated by day 5 posttransplant and continued for at least 1 year. routine prophylaxis for CMV was not given. lofibrosis 1 (1.8) Prior Hematopoietic Cell Transplant Autologous stem cell transplant 10 (17.5) Infections Within Prior 6 Monthsb 23 (40.4) Bacteremiac 12 (21.1) Clostridium difficile infection 9 (15.8) Pneumonia 5 (8.8) Intraabdominal infection 5 (8.8) Respiratory viral infection 1 (1.8) Conditioning Type Myeloablative 31 (54.4) Reduced-intensity 26 (45.6) Conditioning Regi twenty-three (40%) patients had an infection in the preceding 6 months before UCBT. a double-unit UCBT was received by 35 (61%) patients, and a single-unit UCBT was received by 21 (37%) patients. all patients received GVHD prophylaxis, with tacrolimus/mycophenolate mofetil (n = 52), tacrolimus alone (n = 1), or sirolimus/mycophenolate mofetil (n = 1). all patients developed profound neutropenia and thrombocytopenia post-UCBT. Graft-versus-host disease occurred in 35 (61%) patients. twenty-seven had acute GVHD (14 with skin involvement and 18 with gastrointestinal involvement) 5 additional patients had acute followed by chronic GVHD. adenovirus, coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza A, influenza B, parainfluenza, and respiratory syncytial virus. of the total of 32 episodes of CMV noted in 22 patients, 24 were characterized by viremia alone. pesvirus 6 was the most common infection noted within the first 30 days post-UCBT. the most common infection was viremia alone in 24 episodes, meningitis in 2 and pneumonia and posttransplant acute limbic encephalitis in 1 episode. Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus was the pathogen in 10 BSI episodes. Gram-negative bacilli accounted for another 7 BSI episodes. polymicrobial bacteremia was noted on 8 occasions. cIncludes Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp, Citrobacter spp, Enterobacter spp, and Proteus spp. Clostridium difficile infection accounted for 21 (26%) episodes in 16 patients. aspergillosis was defined as proven in 3, probable in 2, and possible in 4. 8 patients had pulmonary infection, 1 with spread to the central nervous system, and 1 isolated central nervous system infection. only 4 had documented recurrence of that same infection in the first 30 days post-UCBT. median time from UCBT to death from infection was 49 days (range, 18\u2013205), and the median time to death from malignancy relapse was 223 days (range, 21\u2013468). 7 of the 13 infections that led to death occurred in the first 30 days post-UCBT, and 4 patients who died developed infection between days 30 and 100 post-UCBT. only 1 death, in the patient with HHV-6 limbic encephalitis, was attributed to these viruses. 32 Mycobacterium chelonae pneumonia 45 55, M CML MA 22 99 HSV-2 meningoencephalitis 105 52, M MM MA 21 28 Disseminated HSV-1 97 54, F AML RIC 18 21 Escherichia coli and VRE bacteremia 38 54, M B-cell lymphoma RIC 16 83 Pulmonary tuberculosis 106 55, F AML RIC 7 120 HHV-6 limbic mean standard deviation 43.1 13.6 BMI (kg/m2), mean standard deviation 26.3 5.7 Hematological Malignancy Acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome 39 (68.4) Lymphomaa 12 (21.1) Multiple myeloma 4 (7.0) Chronic myeloid leukemia 1 (1.8) Myelofibrosis 1 (1.8) Prior Hematopoietic Cell Transplant Autologous stem cell transplant 10 (17.5) Umbilical cord twenty-three (40%) patients had an infection in the preceding 6 months before UCBT. Bacteremia and Clostridium difficile infection were the most common documented infections before UCBT. twenty-seven (47%) patients had at least 1 episode of febrile neutropenia. am were given secondary prophylaxis for infection that occurred before transplantation. all patients received antiviral prophylaxis with acyclovir, 400 mg twice daily. the remaining 10 patients did not have neutrophil engraftment. 82%) patients had neutrophil engraftment at a mean of 20.8 7.0 days. of the 10 patients who never achieved engraftment, 9 died within 100 days of UCBT. a total of 179 episodes of infection were reported in 55 patients. adenovirus, coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza A, influenza B, parainfluenza, and respiratory syncytial virus were the most common viral infections. of the total of 32 episodes of CMV noted in 22 patients over all time periods, 24 were characterized by viremia alone, and 8 involved end-organ disease, which included colitis in 3, pneumonia in 4. all 22 patients who developed CMV infection had antibodies to CMV before UCBT. the remaining 16 seropositive patients did not develop CMV infection. viremia alone in 24 episodes, meningitis in 2 and pneumonia and posttransplant acute limbic encephalitis in 1 episode. most common bacterial infection after UCBT was bloodstream infection (BSI), occurring in 41 episodes in 29 patients. most common bacterial infection after UCBT was bloodstream infection (BSI), occurring in 41 episodes in 29 patients. bIncludes Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp, Citrobacter spp, and Enterobacter spp. Clostridium difficile infection accounted for 21 (26%) episodes in 16 patients. Fungal Infections Eleven episodes of invasive fungal infections were recorded in 10 patients after UCBT. one patient had 2 episodes of Candida glabrata fungemia. median time from UCBT to diagnosis of aspergillosis was 16 days. adenovirus, coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza A, influenza B, parainfluenza, and respiratory syncytial virus were among the most common viral infections. 24 of the 32 episodes of CMV noted in 22 patients over all time periods, 24 were characterized by viremia alone, and 8 involved end-organ disease. all 22 patients who developed CMV infection had antibodies to CMV before UCBT. the remaining 16 seropositive patients did not develop CMV infection. human herpesvirus 6 was the most common infection noted within the first 30 days post-UCBT. the most common bacterial infection after UCBT was bloodstream infection (BSI), occurring in 41 episodes in 29 patients. the predominant organism was coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, accounting for 21 episodes, 17 of which were CLABSI. Clostridium difficile infection accounted for 21 (26%) episodes in 16 patients. there was a trend for VRE infections and C difficile infections to occur more often in the first 30 days posttransplant. Fungal Infections Eleven episodes of invasive fungal infections were recorded in 10 patients after UCBT. one other patient had 2 episodes of Candida glabrata fungemia. median time from UCBT to diagnosis of aspergillosis was 16 days. death from relapse occurred in 18 patients, including the 3 who died in year 2. complications of severe/refractory GVHD in 5, sinusoidal obstruction syndrome in 1, and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in 1. median time from UCBT to death from infection was 49 days (range, 18\u2013205) bacteremia 52 61, F B-cell lymphoma MA No 16 VRE bacteremia 26 34, F AML MA No 12 Disseminated aspergillosis 18 59, F MDS RIC No 12 CNS aspergillosis 20 33, F ALL MA No 20 Septic shock 22 44, F Follicular lymphoma RIC 25 32 Mycobacterium chelonae pneumonia 45 55, M CML MA 22 99 HSV-2 meningo positive CMV serostatus of the recipient and use of ATG or monoclonal T-cell antibodies during conditioning are known risk factors for CMV reactivation. previous studies of infection after UCBT found rates of CMV reactivation from 21% to 64%. HHV-6 was the second most frequent pathogen observed, consistent with prior reports. all 57 patients in our study were on standard-dose acyclovir. despite appropriate antiviral prophylaxis, 8 episodes of HSV reactivation were observed. acyclovir resistance was confirmed in 1 patient who died of disseminated HSV-1 infection. in some centers, VRE has become the most common cause of bacteremia in allogeneic HCT recipients. the reported frequency of nontuberculous mycobacterial infections is 0.4%\u20134.9% in several reports. most cases have been related to infection of central venous catheters. we observed a higher rate of acute GVHD than chronic GVHD in this population. it is possible that higher rates of acute GVHD after UCBT are associated with greater HLA mismatch. but the exact mechanisms remain unclear."}
