AB2, Braintree Scientific, Braintree, MA. blood sampling was performed under a safelight red lamp (120 V, 15 W, model B, catalog no. 152 1517, Kodak, Rochester, NY) to preserve the nocturnal melatonin surge. there were no complications due to anesthesia or cardiocentesis during the course of the investigation. plasma samples were stored at 20 \u00b0C until assayed for melatonin, corticosterone, insulin, leptin, and total fatty acids. melatonin levels were measured by using a 125I-melatonin rat radioimmunoassay kit (catalog no. BA 3500, Labor Diagnostika Nord, Nordham, Germany) arterial plasma samples were prepared in duplicate for the measurement of corticosterone, insulin, and leptin levels by using corticosterone (catalog no. 55-CORMS-E01, mouse\u2013rat, ALPCO, Salem, NH), insulin (catalog no. 80-INSRTH-E01, rat, high-range, ALPCO) chemiluminescent ELISA diagnostic kits. measurements of photometric illuminance (lux) and radiometric irradiance (W/cm2) from outside and inside the front of each cage type showed little to no intercage variability. the mean values were 131.59 4.17 lx (53.95 1.71 W/cm2 outside and at the front of the cage and 91.98 5.31 lx (37.71 2.18 W/cm2) inside at the front of the cage. in the short-wavelength portions of the human visible spectrum (390 to 550 nm) and amber and clear cages displaying larger peak amplitudes in the long-wavelength areas (550 to 700 nm), as expected. the measured interior radiometric and photometric values of the clear, blue, and amber cages used in this study. peaks Cage color 424 nm 480 nm (blue) 532 nm (amber) 605 nm Irradiance Clear 0.0171 0.0166 0.0649 0.0691 Blue 0.0181 0.0177 0.0669 0.0633 Amber 0.0131 0.0145 0.0605 0.0667 Difference between peaks Clear vs blue 5.9 6.7 3.0 8.4 Clear vs amber 23.0 12.6 6.9 3.4 Blue vs am melatonin levels of rats in amber cages were nearly 2-fold higher (P 0.05) than those of rats in clear cages. integrated mean levels for rats in amber cages were 1.3-fold higher (P 0.05) than those of rats in clear cages. calculated total TFA assessed over the 24-h day were significantly (P 0.05) different from one another at 29.1 mg/mL (clear cages), 26.7 mg/mL (amber cages), and 25.1 mg/mL (blue cages). a \u2018phase-advance\u2019 was defined as a shift in a group peak level to an earlier time (that is, from 1200 to 0800) as compared with those of rats in clear cages. phase-delay was defined as a shift in a group to a later time. daily rhythms for arterial glucose and lactate concentrations of rats in amber and clear cages followed near-identical patterns. major peaks in both blood glucose and lactate levels for rats in blue cages occurred at 0800. value is significantly (P 0.05) different from nonmarked values of the same group. daily rhythms for arterial pCO2 were nearly identical for rats in amber and clear cages, with peak values occurring late in the light phase (1600) and lowest values at the middle of the dark phase (2400). arterial pCO2 assessed over the 24-h day were not significantly different from one another. arterial blood pH, O2 saturation, and hematocrit were relatively constant for all groups over the 24-h day. plasma corticosterone levels revealed clear differences among all groups of rats. plasma (A) corticosterone (ng/mL), (B) insulin (ng/mL), and (C) leptin (pg/mL; mean 1 SD; n = 6 per group) in the arterial blood of female nude rats maintained in either standard polycarbonate translucent clear (black circles), polysulfone amber (amber squares), or polycarbonate blue (blue triangles) rodent cages. plasma leptin levels peaked sharply at middark phase (2400) in rats in both blue and clear cages. rats in blue cages had second similar peak amplitude in leptin levels 12 h later, at the midlight phase (1200) the secondary peak was significantly higher in rats in blue cages compared with amber and clear. illuminance (lux) and radiometric irradiance (W/cm2) from outside and inside the front of each cage type were made daily as cages were shifted left-to-right at the same level on the caging racks. the mean values were 131.59 4.17 lx (53.95 1.71 W/cm2 outside and at the front of the cage and 91.98 5.31 lx (37.71 2.18 W/cm2) inside at the the measured correlated color temperature of the fluorescent lamps in the room was 3250 K; there were no significant differences between the correlated color temperatures for the room and those for the rats in each type of cage. the recorded irradiance (W/cm2), illuminance (lux) and photon density values revealed minimal differences in light transmittance depending on the color of the cage. there were no significant differences in food or water intake or body growth rate among the various caging groups during the course of this study. daily food intake was 8.39 0.86 g per 100 g body weight, daily water intake was 12.30 2.01 mL per 100 g body weight daily, and daily weight gain was 2.20 0.40 g. the integrated mean levels of melatonin over the 24-h period for rats in blue cages were nearly 3-fold higher (P 0.05) than those of rats in amber cages. integrated mean levels for rats in amber cages were 1.3-fold higher (P 0.05) than those of rats in clear cages. at 29.1 mg/mL (clear cages), 26.7 mg/mL (amber cages), and 25.1 mg/mL (blue cages) the plasma total fatty acid value (g/mL; mean 1 SD; n = 6 per group) was the sum of myristic, palmitic, palmitoleic, stearic, oleic, linoleic, and arachidonic acids. major peaks in both blood glucose and lactate levels for rats in blue cages occurred at 0800 and appeared to be phase-advanced by 4 h as compared with those for rats in clear cages. total calculated areas under the glucose curves over the 24-h day were lowest for group B, as compared with groups A and C. daily rhythms in arterial pCO2 were nearly identical for rats in amber and clear cages. peak values occurring late in the light phase (1600) and lowest values at the middle of the dark phase (2400). compared with those is clear cages, rats in blue cages showed an apparent 8-h phase-advance of the major peak at 0800. arterial plasma corticosterone, insulin, and leptin concentrations revealed differences. a second, but lower-amplitude peak occurred near the end of the dark phase (0400) in rats in both amber and blue cages. a second, higher-amplitude, peak occurred at 0400 in rats in clear cages. rats were exposed to dark-phase lighting cycles from 1800 to 0600. values for arterial plasma insulin increased to highest levels 2 h after onset of the light-phase (0800), with a secondary minor peak prior to onset of the dark phase (1600) and lowest levels throughout the late light and early dark phases (1600 to 2400) arterial plasma leptin levels peaked sharply at middark phase (2400) in rats in both blue and clear cages. rats in blue cages had second similar peak amplitude in leptin levels 12 h later, at the midlight phase (1200) the secondary peak was significantly higher in rats in blue cages compared with amber and clear. photic environments within the 3 cage types investigated were significantly different from one another only in spectral transmittance of light (color) passing into the cage. photic environments within the 3 cage types investigated were significantly different from one another only in spectral transmittance of light (color) passing into the cage. nocturnal plasma melatonin signal in rats housed in blue-tinted cages was nearly 7-fold higher than in rats housed in clear cages. melatonin production during the dark phase was higher in rats exposed to natural bright sunlight during the day. in amber and blue cages compared with clear cages, the overall pattern of this circadian rhythm was virtually identical among these 3 groups in previous studies. dietary and water intake appear to be in good agreement with that determined for healthy, young female Hsd:RH-Foxn1rnu nude rats in previous studies. ticosterone levels evinced 2 major peaks, one near the end of the light phase and a second slightly higher peak near the end of the dark phase. the timing of the first and second corticosterone peaks were identical to those in clear cages, but the amplitudes of the second peaks were lower compared with those in rats in clear cages. female rats having somewhat higher daily concentrations but male rats showing a more consistent rhythm. this report is the first of a direct association between differences in standard laboratory cage hue and accompanying spectral transmittances, amplification of the normal nighttime melatonin signal, and disruptions in the circadian profiles of blood acid gases, glucose, lactate, corticosterone, insulin, and leptin in mammalian species. researchers in the development of future protocols and scientific publications may well be the basic laboratory animal cage type. the findings presented here make an important contribution to our understanding regarding the influence of the spectral quality of light during scientific investigations."}
