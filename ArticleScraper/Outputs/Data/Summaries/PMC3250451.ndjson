{"summary": "a large number of co-infected individuals may also be observed when two parasites share common risk factors. methods accounting for parasite risk factors must be used to correct for these \u201cfalse interactions\u201d. multiple infections are common in nature but usually more frequently encountered than infections by a single parasite. parasites can thus interact, either in a synergistic manner (parasite A favours infection by parasite B or worsens the symptoms caused by B) or antagonistic manner (parasite A decreases the infection risk by parasite B or reduces the symptoms caused by B) parasite interactions have been shown to affect the success of parasite vaccination strategies [31] and could be involved in disease (re)emergence [32] attempts to detect such effects in natural populations have generally been less successful. field studies are however essential as experimental systems are oversimplified and require an existing suspicion of interaction between the studied parasites. a variety of analytical approaches have been suggested to detect associations in parasite communities. however, they implicitly assume that the direction and strength of an observed association between parasite species reflects an underlying biological interaction. the adoption of a generalized linear mixed modelling approach has been suggested by Fenton et al. [49]. alternative methods have been proposed to determine the expected frequencies in a modified chi-square analysis. some are based on the estimation of \u201cpre-interactive\u201d species prevalences [53], which requires previous knowledge of dominance relationships between parasites species. others are based on log-linear models [e.g.], [54]\u2013[56]. regression analysis based on the idea that the coefficients of the logistic regression of the two viruses can be used to estimate the number of seronegative, single- and double-seropositive individuals expected if the two pathogens are independent. chi-square compares the observed (Oi,j) and theoretical (Ei,j) numbers of individuals with different combinations of status (seropositive or seronegative) for the two pathogens. step 1: Estimated seropositivity probabilities are used to generate in silico serological data for both pathogens independently. step 2: The corrected chi-square is calculated for this in silico dataset. step 1 and 2 were repeated 1000 times, leading to 1000 independent realisations. random seroprevalence datasets were generated assuming independent viruses. random data were always generated assuming that all individuals had an independent 0.5 probability of being seropositive for each pathogen. random data were always generated assuming that all individuals had an independent 0.5 probability of being seropositive for each pathogen. the feline viruses The Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) is a major non-traumatic cause of death in adult cats. it is associated with immunosuppression causing secondary infections. the retrovirus can infect other felids, most of which are threatened or endangered species e.g., the European wildcat (F. s. silvestris) [64]\u2013[66]. cats were anaesthetized, measured, and blood samples were taken from the jugular vein. none of the cats was vaccinated. between 467 and 474 cats were tested for each virus. logistic regression analysis A first way to test the interaction between two pathogens is to test the effect of the serological status to one virus on the probability of being seropositive to the other. the method allows correcting for common risk factors by adding known or suspected risk factors as correction variables. step 1: Estimated seropositivity probabilities are used to generate in silico serological data for both pathogens independently. step 2: The corrected chi-square is calculated for this in silico dataset. step 2: The corrected chi-square is calculated for this in silico dataset. logistic regression analysis a first way to test the interaction between two pathogens is to test the effect of the serological status to one virus on the probability of being seropositive to the other. the method allows correcting for common risk factors by adding known or suspected risk factors as correction variables. step 1: Estimated seropositivity probabilities are used to generate in silico serological data for both pathogens independently. step 2: The corrected chi-square is calculated for this in silico dataset. step 1 and 2 were repeated 1000 times, leading to 1000 independent realisations. random seroprevalence datasets were generated assuming independent viruses. random data were always generated assuming all individuals had an independent 0.5 probability of being seropositive for each pathogen. random data were always generated assuming that all individuals had an independent 0.5 probability of being seropositive for each pathogen. accreditation has been granted to the UMR-CNRS 5558 (accreditation number 692660703) for the program. the feline viruses The Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) is a major non-traumatic cause of death in adult cats. it is associated with immunosuppression causing secondary infections.

the logistic regression approach is much faster to run (less than a second versus 2.5 minutes for the corrected chi-square for a model with 6 factors in full interaction and 300 individuals, for 1000 bootstraps, using a desktop computer with an Intel(R) core(TM)2 quad CPU Q6600 processor) the corrected chi-square is more robust than the logistic regression, especially for small sample size. the logistic regression approach can be considered robust, at least for a 5% rejection threshold. three pairs of feline viruses out of six appeared to be significantly associated. the infection probability of all viruses increases with host' age [62], thus age must strongly participate in the generation of false interactions. in humans infected by feline AIDS, feline AIDS is characterised by a chronic immunodeficiency, allowing subsequent opportunistic infections. cats co-infected by FIV and FCV or FHV had more severe disease signs than non-FIV infected cats [87], [88], [88]. the presence of FHV was shown to accelerate FIV transcription through the activation of the FIV long terminal repeat [89], a phenomenon that was the persistence of FPV-antibodies can be longer than 7 years [98] and consequently, double seropositivity against FPV and FIV is not synonymous of co-infection. the persistence of FPV-antibodies can be longer than 7 years. the interaction between FPV and FPV is expected to be stronger than that between FCV and FPV. however, contrary to FPV, it would require that the FCV-infection occurs within the two weeks post-FPV infection. the association could also result from the existence of an unknown confounding factor common to FHV, FCV and FPV. the study of macroparasites on the field is most of the time limited to presence-absence data (i.e., serology), making the detection of associations between parasites more complicated from a methodological point of view. it has been attributed to variability in multiple genes that regulate virus cell entry, acquired and innate immunity. the corrected chi-square test must indeed be preferred for small sample size. a first solution would be to use the corrected chi-square as soon as simulation times are acceptable. the corrected chi-square is more robust than the logistic regression, especially for small sample size. two P-values have been proposed for the corrected chi-square. the first relies on the assumption that the corrected chi-square is proportional to a chi-square with one degree of freedom. the second simply counts the proportion of in silico datasets for which the value of the corrected chi-square is above the observed value. three pairs of feline viruses out of six appeared to be significantly associated. the logistic regression approach can be considered robust, at least for a 5% rejection threshold. age-dependence is due to both a biological effect and a mechanical effect. a sero-epidemiological study suggests that the identified risk factors explain by themselves the apparent increase of double sero-positive individuals. if experimental investigations suggest a synergy between FIV and FHV and between FIV and FCV towards a more severe disease, we did not find any significant association. FPV-FCV, FHV-FPV and FCV-FPV were significantly associated after correction by their known risk factors. the interaction between FPV and FPV is expected to be stronger than that between FCV and FCV. a similar association between FPV and FCV antibodies was described in free-ranging lions in east africa [99] this work pointed out new probable synergies between feline viruses that can now be further investigated in laboratory conditions. however, the associations could result from the existence of an unknown confounding factor common to FHV, FCV and FPV. if FPV-seropositive cats are more susceptible to infections, we cannot exclude the existence of another one. the study of microparasites on the field is most of the time limited to presence-absence data (i.e., serology), making the detection of associations between parasites more complicated from a methodological point of view. the corrected chi-square test must indeed be preferred for small sample size. the understanding of parasites interactions and of their consequences on diseases evolution, emergence and management is indeed a crucial challenge for human and animal epidemiologists of our time. the problem was coded 1 when the test was significant, 0 when not and the resulting logistic regression was drawn. three scenarios are considered: i) all factors are qualitative (A); ii) all factors are quantitative (B) and iii) a half of the factors is quantitative and the other half is qualitative (mixed scenario, C). the dashed horizontal line represents a type I error of 5%. file S4 is a generated dataset provided to test the R program. it is made of 4 risk factors (2 quantitative and 2 qualitative factors), 2 serological statuses and 100 individuals."}
