{"summary": "the Chinese WAAQ is a reliable and valid tool for assessing psychological flexibility in Chinese oncology nurses. the Chinese WAAQ had high internal consistency (Cronbach's = 0.920), with an item-total correlation coefficient of 0.702\u20130.828. a high incidence of anxiety, depression, and stress has been reported in nurses working in china and Hong Kong. oncology nurses have high levels of emotional exhaustion, and a large proportion of them are at risk of developing burnout. psychological flexibility was measured by the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire (AAQ)[25] and its revised version (AAQ-II). in 2013, Bond et al. developed the work-related AAQ (WAAQ) and then validated its good reliability and validity (mean coefficient = 0.83) data from the WAAQ were used to assess criterion validity, convergent validity, internal consistency, and split-half reliability. 244 of these nurses completed second assessments at 2\u20134-week intervals to obtain test-retest reliability. postgraduate students translated the English version into Chinese. the prefinal Chinese version of the WAAQ was pilot tested by a panel of experts. measures six instruments were used for data collection: the WAAQ (Chinese version), AAQ-II, general health questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12), general self-efficacy scale (GSES), Utrecht work engagement scale (GSES), and a general questionnaire. the items reflect the extent to which people can take goal-directed action in the presence of difficult internal experiences. higher scores indicate lower levels of psychological flexibility. the AAQ-II has better psychometric properties and a clearer factor structure than the first AAQ version. the Chinese version of GSES was administered to university freshmen in 1995. the internal consistency was 0.91, test-retest reliability is 0.71. a total of 244 nurses completed the second assessments 2\u20134 weeks later. content validity index (I-CVI) value can be computed for each item on a scale. the scale-level CVI (S-CVI) is comprised of S-CVI/UA and S-CVI/Ave (average I-CVI across items) a convenience sample of 417 nurses from a cancer tertiary hospital completed the questionnaire. data from the WAAQ were used to assess criterion validity, convergent validity, internal consistency, and split-half reliability. 244 of these nurses completed second assessments at 2\u20134-week intervals. two psychology experts, two ACT experts, two highly qualified nursing specialists, and three bilingual native Chinese postgraduate students majoring in English. the first five stages were completed by cooperation between two psychology experts, two ACT experts, two highly qualified nursing specialists, and three bilingual native Chinese postgraduate students. a panel of experts evaluated the degree of equivalence between the English version and Chinese version. the translated scale was pilot-tested twice with 30 nurses of different educational levels to check their understanding of the scale items and response options. misunderstandings were not found. ance and Action Questionnaire-II The AAQ-II[26] is a general measure of psychological inflexibility. it consists of seven items rated on a seven-point Likert-type scale. items reflect an unwillingness to experience unwanted emotions and thoughts. higher scores indicate lower levels of psychological flexibility. the GSES was developed by sherer et al. in 1982,[35] which comprises 10 items rated by a Likert-4 scoring system from 1 (\u201cabsolutely incorrect\u201d) to 4 (\u201ctotally correct\u201d) the factor loadings ranged from 0.59\u20130.77, with internal consistency coefficient 0.86. a total of 244 nurses completed the second assessments 2\u20134 weeks later to obtain the test-retest reliability. the test-retest reliability was undertaken by calculating the correlation coefficient (r) between the WAAQ scores acquired at test and retest times. interpreted correlation coefficients of 0.10, 0.30, and 0.50 can be classified as \u201csmall,\u201d \u201cmedium/moderate\u201d and \u201clarge\u201d effects. the principal component analysis was done using oblique rotation. the suitability of the data for the analyses were confirmed by a Kaiser\u2013Meyer\u2013Olkin Index of 0.6\u20131.0[47].

I-CVI and S-CVI were used to assess content validity. I-CVI values were between 0.83 and 1.00; S-CVI/UA and S-CVI/Ave were 0.86 and 0.98 respectively. experts did not recommend removal of any items, suggesting good acceptability of the items. the AAQ-II showed lower correlations than the WAAQ with work engagement as measured by the UWES and self-efficacy as measured by the GSES. the AAQ-II showed higher correlations than the WAAQ with psychological distress as measured by the GHQ-12. a clear one-factor solution was found according to the Kaiser criterion. this factor explained 67.86% of the variance in item scores. e Mean score (SD) Corrected item-total correlation Cronbach's if an item is deleted Item 1 5.1 (1.56) 0.702 0.914 Item 2 4.8 (1.51) 0.738 0.910 Item 3 4.7 (1.53) 0.828 0.901 Item 4 4.3 (1.54) 0.719 0.912 Item 5 5.3 (1.52) 0.765 0.907 Item 6 4.8 (1.51) 0.792 0.904 Item 7 bach's coefficients (0.920 for the total scale) and item-total correlation coefficients (0.786\u20130.878) the odd-even split-half reliability is generally considered to be satisfied. high test-retest reliability over 2\u20134 weeks (r = 0.772) was also found. the Chinese version of the WAAQ can measure the psychological flexibility for oncology nurses in workplace. however, the absence of longitudinal data did not allow for testing the responsiveness of the Chinese version of the WAAQ."}
