{"summary": "advanced technologies such as massively parallel or deep sequencing (MPS), broad-range PCR with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS; PLEX-ID platform) and virus microarrays have been used for research investigations of a variety of clinical samples, environmental materials, and some biological products. Detection of latent viruses [8,9] or novel viruses [10] has also been reported in some cell lines. assays can be used to activate latent viruses to enhance their detection. the PLEX-ID platform amplifies nucleic acids using broad-range PCR primers followed by electrospray mass-spectrometry to detect a variety of microbial agents. a genomic signature is generated and the target family is identified. ViroChip v.5 (University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA) can detect 2000 viruses [2,21,22]. PLEX-ID, virus microarrays, and reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR assays for detection of known viruses. we have developed a follow-up strategy for identification of a positive result detected by the PLEX-ID to determine the relevance and significance of the nucleic acid detection signal. set of virus dilutions (103\u2013107 for XMRV and 103\u2013106 for SFV-1) were tested three times by RT-PCR assays in a background of water and in 105 or 104 cell equivalents of Sf9 nucleic acids. the results of the LOD from the three assays were similar. the size of fragments in the 100 bp marker (M) is indicated in base pairs (bp) PLEX-ID ViroChip RT-PCR a RNA Dilution b TCID50/mL Particles/L c (-)Sf9 +105 (-)Sf9 +105 (-)Sf9 (-)Sf9 +105 103 101.5 312 + + + nt d nt + 104 100.5 PLEX-ID and virus arrays tested selected virus RNA samples for comparative LOD analysis. most samples were tested at least two times and a number of samples were independently tested in our laboratory using an on-site PLEX-ID machine and beta-test panels. LLMDA detected SFV-1 in the 105 RNA dilution, which corresponded to 0.312 virus particles per L. filtered supernatant from uninfected LNCaP cells and the complete medium used for virus propagation were tested by LLMDA. total nucleic acids were extracted from cell pellets and analyzed using PLEX-ID Biopharma Viral Assay Kits (Athogen, Ibis Biosciences, Carlsbad, CA, USA) biological raw materials such as complete medium, FBS, trypsin, PBS, and ultra-Pure dH2O were also tested by PLEX-ID. a BLAST search was performed using their respective PLEX-ID forward and reverse primer sequences. the analysis revealed multiple hits to human chromosomes, suggesting that the alpharetrovirus and betaretrovirus sequences detected were due to endogenous retroviral sequences known to be present in human DNA [26]. simian virus 40 (SV40) sequences were detected by PLEX-ID in 293T/17 cells. simian virus 40 (SV40) sequences were constitutively expressed in 293T/17 cells. adenovirus sequences in 293T/17 and HEK293 cells were not detected. a novel rhabdovirus that was reported in insect Sf9 cells [33] was not detected by PLEX-ID even though broad-range primers designed to detect members of the Rhabdoviridae family were included in the PLEX-ID biopharma Porcine origin viral assay used to screen the cell lines. a subset of cell lines tested by PLEX-ID (Raji, MDCK, VERO, Sf9, and SL2) was also analyzed rhabdovirus that was found in the Sf9 cell line was not detected by LLMDA. MDCK and VERO were also tested using the ViroChip. RD114 was not detected in MDCK cells. follow-up strategy for a positive hit by PLEX-ID. gammaretrovirus fragment amplified from total nucleic acids extracted from MDCK cells. alignment highlighting different areas of similarity between RD114, several chromosomal Canis lupus familiaris BAC clones. a maximum likelihood tree was constructed using a conserved region from BAC clones A\u2013L. sequence of the MDCK-RD114 PCR fragment to interrogate the Canis lupus familiaris database.

RNA dilution panels were used to determine the LOD of these viruses using PLEX-ID, RT-PCR assays, and virus microarrays. a subset of virus dilutions (103\u2013107 for XMRV and 103\u2013106 for SFV-1) were tested three times by RT-PCR assays in a background of water. MRV was 3.12 particles per L (Table 1) and for SFV-1 was 40.2 particles per L. in both cases virus detection was 10-fold less sensitive in the presence of 105 cell equivalents of Sf9 nucleic acids. sensitivity of SFV-1 detection was similar to virus detection in the absence of Sf9 nucleic acids. PLEX-ID and Virus Arrays Based upon the RT-PCR results, selected virus RNA samples were spiked into RNase/DNase free water [()Sf9] or present (+) in 105 or 104 cell equivalents of Sf9 total nucleic acids. c Calculated based upon RT activity determined by TSF-PERT assay; d Not tested. PLEX-ID detected XMRV in the RNA dilution of 105 both in the absence and presence of Sf9 total nucleic acids. SFV-1 was not detected due to the absence of virus family-specific primers in the PLEX-ID panels. negative results were obtained. only viral sequences with a threshold of at least five or more probes matching the viral genome with 94%\u2013100% identity were reported. PLEX-ID had the same LOD in the absence and presence of 105 cell equivalents of Sf9 total nucleic acids and RT-PCR had a similar LOD in the absence and presence of 104 cell equivalents of Sf9 total nucleic acids. an RT-minus PCR control (RT panels) was negative indicating the absence of cellular DNA contamination in the RNA preparations. the LOD in the absence of Sf9 nucleic acids for XMRV was 3.12 particles per L (Table 1) and for SFV-1 was 40.2 particles per L (Table 2); however, virus detection was 10-fold less sensitive in the presence of 105 cell equivalents of Sf9 nucleic acids. b Viral RNA dilution series were spiked into RNase/DNase free water or present (+) in 105 or 104 cell equivalents of Sf9 total nucleic acids. c Calculated based upon RT activity determined by TSF-PERT assay. PLEX-ID and virus arrays tested selected virus RNA samples for comparative LOD analysis. most samples were tested at least two times and a number of samples were independently tested in our laboratory using an on-site PLEX-ID machine and beta-test panels. results obtained using the PLEX-ID and virus arrays to analyze the XMRV RNA panel and the SFV-1 RNA panel are shown in Table 1 and Table 2 respectively. analysis of XMRV using the ViroChip indicated an LOD of 0.312 particles per L (RNA dilution 106) in the absence of Sf9 nucleic acids. only viral sequences with a threshold of at least five or more probes matching the viral genome with 94%\u2013100% identity were reported. the cell lines analyzed in this study and the PLEX-ID results are shown in Table 3. some of the peaks were found to be potential \u201cunidentified\u201d alpharetrovirus sequences, which were not present in Athogen\u2019s curated database. alpharetroviruses and betaretroviruses were found in all of the human cell lines. a BLAST search was performed using their respective PLEX-ID forward and reverse primer sequences. the analysis revealed multiple hits to human chromosomes. the analysis revealed multiple hits to human chromosomes. no unidentified BCs were found after in-depth mass spectrometry analysis. PLEX-ID analysis of the canine MDCK and Cf2Th cell lines identified RD114-like gammaretrovirus sequences. also, \u201cundistinguishable\u201d gammaretrovirus sequences were found in both cells whose BC matched several known gammaretroviruses. PLEX-ID analysis A subset of cell lines tested by PLEX-ID was also analyzed using virus arrays of which VERO and SL2 were tested at least two times. at a quantile threshold of 0.99, LLMDA detected HERV-K in VERO and Raji cells but other sequences detected by PLEX-ID such as SERV and BaEV-related in VERO and alpharetrovirus sequences (ALV- and RAV-related) in total nucleic acids were extracted from cell pellets and analyzed using PLEX-ID Biopharma Viral Assay Kits (Athogen, Ibis Biosciences, Carlsbad, CA, USA) biological raw materials such as complete medium, FBS, trypsin, PBS, and ultra-Pure dH2O were also tested by PLEX-ID. virus 2 (RAV-2)-like sequences were detected in Raji, A204, and HeLa cells. simian retrovirus 1 (SRV-1)-related sequences were detected in all of the human cell lines. a BLAST search was performed using their respective PLEX-ID forward and reverse primer sequences. SRV-1 and baboon endogenous virus sequences were detected in VERO cells. no unidentified BCs were found after mass spectrometry analysis. PLEX-ID analysis of the human cell lines identified RD114-like gammaretrovirus sequences. a novel rhabdovirus that was reported in insect Sf9 cells [33] was not detected by PLEX-ID even though broad-range primers designed to detect members of the Rhabdoviridae family were included in the PLEX-ID biopharma Porcine origin viral assay used to screen the cell lines. a subset of cell lines tested by PLEX-ID (Raji, MDCK, VERO, Sf9, and SL2) was also analyzed a follow-up strategy was developed to confirm and identify RD114 retroviral sequences detected by PLEX-ID in MDCK and Cf2Th cells. PCR primers targeted the same highly conserved region of the gammaretrovirus pol gene as in the PLEX-ID analysis. total nucleic acids extracted from MDCK cells were subjected to a nested PCR assay. comparison with the RD114 virus genome indicated 97% sequence identity. an alignment highlighting different areas of similarity between RD114, several chromosomal Canis lupus familiaris BAC clones and the MDCK PCR fragment are shown. a maximum likelihood tree was constructed using a conserved region from BAC clones A\u2013L and distant homologs, HTLV-1 and ALV [34]. PLEX-ID amplicon identified as RD114 and sequence shared strong sequence identity with several BAC clones. alignment was done with RD114 complete retrovirus genome (Genbank ID AB705392.1) as the query. PLEX-ID identified viral sequences belonging to RD114 gag and pol.

XMRV had 3.12 105 particles per L. the RNA was eluted in 200 L of DNase/RNase-free water. concentration and purity were determined by using UV absorbance. RNA panels were made in the presence and absence of background Sf9 cell nucleic acids. primers SFVgagF1 (5'-AACCTAGGTGGAGAGAGCTGAAGG-3') and SFVgagR2 (5'-ACCTGCTGAATGTGTGTGC-3') to generate a 947 bp fragment. cDNA (2 L) was used in a 50 L reaction containing 1.5 U Taq DNA Polymerase (Roche Applied Science), 0.5 mM primers, 0.2 mM dNTP mix cell pellets were resuspended in 200 L AVE buffer or 200 L of liquid sample were processed using the QIAamp\u00ae MinElute\u00ae Virus Spin Kit. a one-step 50 L RT-PCR reaction containing 5 L of total nucleic acids extract was performed as previously described. RNA, DNA, and nucleic acid samples were sent to LLNL and university of California, San Francisco. each RNA sample (10 L for the LLMDA and 11 L for the Virochip) was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using random primers and PCR-amplified prior to labeling with Cy3 fluorescent dye. viroChip v.5 was an 8-plex 60K format and updated to include 60,000 probes representing complete and partial sequences of all viral genomes in GenBank as of December 2010. PCR primers were developed using nested PCR assay and nucleotide sequencing. outer primers were 3417F (5'-TGGGGATTGGAAATTAC-3') and 3417R (5'-TGTTCTATTTCTCTAC-3') total nucleic acids (5 L) from MDCK cells were amplified in a PCR reaction of total volume 50 L containing 1.5 U Taq DNA Polymerase (Roche Applied Science, cat.

XMRV was equivalent to RT-PCR in the absence of background nucleic acids, and greater by one log in the presence of 105 cell equivalents of Sf9 total nucleic acids. but SFV-1 could not be detected by the PLEX-ID due to the absence of relevant primers. endogenous retrovirus sequences detected by PLEX-ID in canine cells were associated with defective endogenous gammaretroviruses. blast analysis and amplicon base count comparisons also revealed that endogenous retrovirus sequences were responsible for positive hits within the alpharetrovirus and betaretrovirus families detected in human cell lines."}
