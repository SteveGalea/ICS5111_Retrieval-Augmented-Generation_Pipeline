{"summary": "CAP is the leading cause of death worldwide, with a significant impact on morbidity rates. despite the vast diversity of respiratory microbiota, widespread dissemination of potentially pathogenic agents, the phenomenon of globalization, and viral epidemics, CAP remains the most prevalent pathogen among the etiologic agents. the SBPT Committee on Respiratory Infections summoned 13 members with recognized experience in CAP in Brazil who developed 12 questions. the questions were divided among the authors, who conducted a nonsystematic review of the literature, but giving priority to major publications in the specific areas. major ultrasound findings in CAP include consolidations, a focal interstitial pattern, subpleural lesions, and pleural line abnormalities. the specificity of CUS for consolidations is 100%, whereas chest X-ray reaches a sensitivity of 94% for this type of change. the use of chest CT in patients with suspected CAP resulted in 16% of the patients having alternative diagnoses or findings, such as pulmonary thromboembolism and neoplasia. the use of chest CT increases the rate of diagnosis in patients with CAP and normal chest X-rays, but it may also not confirm the disease in patients with opacities on chest X-rays. chest X-ray should be mandatory for patients with suspected CAP. 7 Chest X-ray is also recommended if there is doubt about diagnosis or differential diagnosis from lung cancer is required and if clinical response is unsatisfactory. the use of chest CT in patients with suspected CAP resulted in 16% of patients having alternative diagnoses or findings, such as pulmonary thromboembolism and neoplasia. some authors have suggested the use of chest CT as an intermediate ancillary test before the use of CT in the diagnosis of difficult-to-diagnose cases. in patients with severe CAP or CAP unresponsive to the initial empiric treatment regimen, as well as in ICU patients, remain valid. the development of new methods for microbiological identification in general has increased the chances of adequately choosing the spectrum of the antibiotic to be used in the treatment of pneumonia. xtag respiratory pathogen panel can identify 18 viruses, M. pneumoniae, and C. pneumoniae. the current recommendations for the use of molecular tests include: (1) highly accurate rapid testing for influenza; (2) rapid molecular testing for M. tuberculosis. studies have detected viruses in approximately one third of CAP cases in adults, 20, 21 with influenza being the most commonly isolated virus. other viral agents, such as rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, and metapneumovirus, are considered possible etiologic agents of CAP. ancillary tests, particularly molecular tests, are indicated for the diagnosis of viruses especially in cases of severe CAP. 37 - 40 Prognostic scoring systems measure severity and help predict prognosis in CAP. 22, 47 PSI The PSI comprises 20 items including demographic characteristics, comorbidities, abnormal laboratory test results, abnormal radiological findings, and physical examination findings. but the PSI may underestimate CAP severity in young patients without concomitant diseases because its scoring system gives too much weight to age and presence of comorbidities. CURB-65 is an acronym for the variables it assesses: mental Confusion (an Abbreviated Mental Test score 8) 48. Urea > 50 mg/dL; Respiratory rate > 30 breaths/min; blood pressure (systolic 90 mmHg or diastolic 60 mmHg); and age 65 years. the major limitation of CURB-65 and CRB-65 is the exclusion of comorbidities that may increase the risk of complications in CAP, such as alcoholism, heart or liver failure, and neoplasia. CURB-65 and CRB-65 are qualified by their simplicity, immediate applicability, and ease of use, whether in the hospital setting or elsewhere. systolic blood pressure 90 mmHg (11 points) and urea > 30 mg/dL (5 points); altered level of consciousness (5 points); age 80 years (5 points); and radiological findings of multilobar or bilateral infiltrate (5 points). systolic blood pressure 90 mmHg (13 points) and systolic blood pressure 90 mmHg (11 points) are more objective markers of CAP severity. in absence of severe CAP, socioeconomic indications for hospital admission, concomitant decompensated diseases, and hypoxemia, the attending physician should consider outpatient treatment for patients with CAP. the PSI comprises 20 items including demographic characteristics, comorbidities, abnormal laboratory test results, abnormal radiological findings, and physical examination findings. CURB-65 is an acronym for the variables it assesses: mental Confusion (an Abbreviated Mental Test score 8) 48. Urea > 50 mg/dL; Respiratory rate > 30 breaths/min; blood pressure (systolic 90 mmHg or diastolic 60 mmHg; and age 65 years) CURB-65: mental Confusion; Respiratory rate > 30 breaths/min; and age 65 years; and CAP: community-acquired pneumonia. major limitation of CURB-65 and CRB-65 is exclusion of comorbidities that may increase the risk of complications in CAP. the major criteria are pH 7.30 (13 points) and systolic blood pressure 90 mmHg (11 points) the minor criteria are RR > 30 breaths/min (9 points); urea > 30 mg/dL (5 points); altered level of consciousness (5 points); age 80 years (5 points); and radiological findings of multilobar or bilateral infiltrate (5 points). a score greater than 3 identified 92% of patients who required mechanical ventilation or vasoactive drugs during the course of CAP. it is recommended that patients with CAP should be objectively evaluated in the emergency room for initial disease severity and for early identification of risk of developing severe outcomes. CAP is a condition with intense inflammatory activity. 50, 51 C-reactive protein is secreted by hepatic cells in response to an increase in interleukin-6, interleukin-1, and TNF- levels. other recognized sources of C-reactive protein are lymphocytes, monocytes, neurons, and atherosclerotic plaques. a study of 191 patients with CAP admitted to the ICU showed that mortality was 4.8% among those in whom procalcitonin levels decreased rapidly (n = 66), 17.3% among those in whom procalcitonin levels decreased slowly (n = 81), and 36.4% among those in whom procalcitonin levels did not decrease (n = 44). it is important to emphasize that biomarkers should be used in complement to clinical evaluation rather than as a single criterion. procalcitonin as a guide for initiation and duration of antibiotic therapy resulted in a reduced risk of mortality, reduced antibiotic use, and a reduced risk of antibiotic-related side effects. 58 american, european, British, and Latin-American guidelines differ with regard to the treatment of outpatients. the 2007 ATS/IDSA guidelines advocate treatment of atypical pathogens and pneumococci and suggest macrolides or doxycycline if no antibiotic resistance is suspected. the drugs most associated with treatment failure were -lactams (in 25.7%), followed by macrolides (in 22.9%), tetracyclines (in 22.5%), and new fluoroquinolones (in 20.8%). loxacin or gemifloxacin 5-7 Treatment of ward patients Third-generation cephalosporins (ceftriaxone or cefotaxime) or amoxicillin + clavulanic acid + a macrolide

piperacillin/tazobactam, meropenem, polymyxin B (monotherapy or combined therapy) 10-14 Patients with suspected aspiration pneumonia Aspiration of gastric contents, necrotizing pneumonia, lung abscess, or severe periodontal disease. fluoroquinolones should be reserved for patients with risk factors and more severe disease. ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, or gemifloxacin, is not recommended for the treatment of CAP caused by community pathogens. ciprofloxacin, despite being a second-generation fluoroquinolone, is not recommended for the treatment of CAP. 68, 69 Studies comparing combination therapy with a -lactam and a macrolide with monotherapy with a fluoroquinolone have shown no differences in 90-day mortality, length of hospital stay, or prescription of an oral antibiotic. current recommendation is to use a -lactam plus a macrolide or a respiratory fluoroquinolone alone. the mortality rate was significantly lower in patients receiving combination therapy with different classes of antibiotics than in those receiving monotherapy or other antimicrobial combinations. the mortality rate was significantly lower in patients receiving combination therapy with different classes of antibiotics than in those receiving monotherapy or other antimicrobial combinations. combination therapy should be recommended for patients with severe CAP and an indication for ICU admission. antibiotics should be administered as early as possible, and antibiotic regimens should preferably include a macrolide and a -lactam, both administered intravenously. the 2007 ATS/IDSA

moxifloxacin, or gemifloxacin) or combination therapy with a -lactam and a macrolide has been guideline recommended for the treatment of ward patients with CAP. these regimens provide good coverage and produce good results in infections caused by S. pneumoniae, M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, or Legionella sp. 29, 51, 54 Res 68, 69 Studies comparing combination therapy with a -lactam and a macrolide with monotherapy with a fluoroquinolone have shown no differences in 90-day mortality, length of hospital stay, or prescription of an oral antibiotic. 67, 69, 70 The current

local epidemiology. rapidly progressive necrotizing pneumonia is a typical presentation of CA-MRSA. in these patients, MRSA, extended-spectrum -lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae have been common agents of pneumonia. the drugs of choice for the treatment of CA-MRSA infection are those that inhibit toxin production: clindamycin, linezolid, or vancomycin. the drugs of choice for the treatment of CA-MRSA infection are those that inhibit toxin production. linezolid has been shown to be superior to vancomycin in the treatment of severe MRSA infections. infections with drug-resistant strains of Pseudomonas sp. have been treated as monotherapy or combination therapy. intravenous 1-2 g 8 Ceftaroline Intravenous 600 mg 12 Ceftriaxone Intravenous 400 mg 8-12 Clarithromycin Oral 500 mg 12

antibiotic therapy for community-acquired pneumonia.a. authors. treatment duration sufficient to ensure CAP treatment success may vary based on CAP severity as defined by currently available severity scores. a meta-analysis evaluating the efficacy of short-term (less than 7 days) regimens in adult patients with mild to moderate CAP involving 2,796 patients in 15 selected studies. for mild CAP, monotherapy for 5 days seems to be sufficient. extending treatment should be considered if symptoms do not improve after 3 days. 96 strategies and procedures aimed at shortening the duration of antibiotic therapy have been tested by comparing short- and long-term treatments. treatment can be extended up to 14 days at the discretion of the attending physicians. a balance between activation of the immune response and control of inflammation is key to fighting the infection without adjacent tissue injury. the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is responsible for the production of cortisol. patients in the corticosteroid-treated group had shorter time to clinical stability than those in the control group. clinical stability was defined as a return to normal levels of temperature, HR, RR, SpO2, mental status, systolic blood pressure, and ability to tolerate oral food intake. patients who received methylprednisolone had a lower risk of treatment failure compared with those in the control group. corticosteroid use resulted in good tolerance without increasing incidence of adverse effects, except for hyperglycemia, which was more commonly reported in the group receiving corticosteroid therapy. influenza type A infection is associated with pandemics and with disease of greater severity. influenza type B infection is associated with regional epidemics. influenza type C infection is associated with small isolated outbreaks. two types of influenza vaccine are approved by the Brazilian National Health Oversight Agency. available for specific indications, through the Brazilian Unified Health Care System, during vaccination campaigns. available in private clinics and administered for the same indications. vaccination should be postponed until remission occurs In cases of a history of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome occurring within 6 weeks after a previous dose of the vaccine, careful medical evaluation is recommended. no precautions are needed before vaccination Cold compresses can relieve reactions at the vaccine injection site. a dose of PCV13 should be given first, followed by a dose of PPSV23 6-12 months later and a second dose of PPSV23 5 years after the first one. for those who have received two doses of PPSV23, it is recommended that a third dose be given after this age, at least 5 years after the most recent dose. 82, 115, 126 - 129 Indications for the vaccine Adults aged 60 years or older Individuals between 2 and 59 years of age with chronic heart disease, chronic lung disease, sickle cell disease, diabetes, alcoholism, liver cirrhosis, cerebrospinal fluid fistulas, or cochlear implants. influenza type A infection is associated with pandemics and with disease of greater severity; influenza type B infection is associated

Individuals who should not be vaccinated People with severe allergy to chicken eggs, with signs of anaphylaxis should receive the vaccine in a setting in which anaphylactic reactions can be treated. 124 PCV13 should be administered as a single dose to adults aged 50 years or older, including those previously vaccinated with the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. a dose of PCV13 should be given first, followed by a dose of PPSV23 6-12 months later and a second dose of PPSV23 5 years after the first one. the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine results in a 45.6% reduction in cases of vaccine-serotype CAP, a 45% reduction in cases of bacterial pneumonia, and a 75% reduction in cases of invasive pneumococcal disease."}
