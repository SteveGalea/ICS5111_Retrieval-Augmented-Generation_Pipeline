{"summary": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of severe lower respiratory tract diseases in infancy and early childhood. there is no licensed vaccine against RSV yet. attachment glycoprotein (G) of RSV is potentially important target for protective antiviral immune responses. in the 1960s, the immunization of children with formalin inactivated-RSV (FI-RSV) vaccine failed to protect, but also yielded enhanced pulmonary disease in vaccinated infants following RSV infection (4,5) studies with BALB/c mice have become a useful model for RSV pathogenesis. immunization with a recombinant baculovirus expressing the hemagglutinin gene of influenza virus elicited a strong innate immune response. it is known that there is no baculovirus-specific immunity in mammals that might interfere the action of baculovirus-based vaccine (17-19) the recombinant baculoviruses were purified from supernatants of infected insect cells with 25% (w/v) sucrose in 5 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA in a SW28 rotor. the pellet was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and centrifuged for 4 h at 24,000 rpm, 4\u00b0C. mice were lightly anesthetized by ether/chloroform inhalation. mice were challenged i.n. with 1106 PFU of live RSV A2 strain. all animal studies were performed according to the guidelines of our Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. the lungs were perfused with 5 ml of PBS containing 10 U/ml heparin. the tissue was then processed through a steel screen to obtain a single-cell suspension. freshly explanted BAL fluid or lung cells were purified by density gradient centrifugation. cells were stained for surface markers, washed, fixed, permeabilized with fluorescence-activated cell sorter buffer containing 0.5% saponin (Sigma-Aldrich, Seoul, Korea) the antibodies used were anti-IFN- (clone XMG1.2) or anti-IL-17A (TC11-18H10.1). Dead cells were excluded on the basis of forward and side light scatter patterns. both antibodies were purchased from BD PharMingen (San Diego, CA) after staining, cells were fixed in PBS-2% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde, and events were acquired using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer. subsets of mice were euthanized and the lungs were removed into Eagle's modified essential medium. recombinant baculoviruses were purified from supernatants of infected insect cells with 25% (w/v) sucrose in 5 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA. the pellet was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and centrifuged for 4 h at 24,000 rpm, 4\u00b0C. mice kept under specific-pathogen-free conditions for immunization. mice were lightly anesthetized by ether/chloroform inhalation. mice were challenged i.n. with 1106 PFU of live RSV A2 strain. rabbit anti-mouse total IgG, secondary antibody. plates were washed five times and developed with 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine. lungs were perfused with 5 ml of PBS containing 10 U/ml heparin. 2106 freshly explanted lung lymphocytes were cultured in a culture tube. cells were left untreated or stimulated with 10M G (183-195) peptide (WAICKRIPNKKPG) and then incubated for 5 h at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. cells were incubated for 15 min with anti-Fc receptor antibody (2.4G2). cells were stained with specific antibodies at final concentration of 1g/100l in PBS-3% FBS-0.09% NaN3. both antibodies were purchased from BD PharMingen (San Diego, CA) western blotting analysis was performed with sucrose gradient-purified baculoviruses. specific bands of 70 kDa to 90 kDa were detected in the purified Bac-RSV/G particles, but not in Bac-control virus particles. intranansal Bac-RSV/G immunization induces humoral immune responses. secretory IgA titers were measured in the BAL fluid for each immune group five days after RSV challenge. results represent log2 endpoint values from four to five individual mice. data are representative of at least three independent experiments. G-specific CD4+IFN-+cells were detected in the lungs of Bac-RSV/G-immunized group (2.5% of gated CD4 T cells on average), while few specific cells (0.2% of CD4 T cells) were observed in the lungs of Bac-RSV/G-vaccinated mice. 4 are shown in each dot plot and the percentages represent the frequency of G-specific IFN-positive cells. results are a representative of two independent experiments. immunization of Bac-RSV/G prevented any detectable RSV replication in the lungs during peak of infection. this might be due to nonspecific innate immunity induced by baculovirus inoculation. each group of immune mice was challenged with 1106 PFU of RSV A2 at 4 weeks after immunization. intranasal Bac-RSV/G immunization promotes neither lung eosinophilia nor vaccine-induced eosinophilia. results suggest that intranasal Bac-RSV/G immunization barely increase the risk of vaccine-induced eosinophilia. control of the polyhedrin promoter, Bac-RSV/G, was generated using a pFastBac-1 plasmid. western blotting analysis was performed with sucrose gradient-purified baculoviruses. specific bands of 70 kDa to 90 kDa were detected in the purified Bac-RSV/G particles, but not in Bac-control virus particles. secretory IgA titers were measured in the BAL fluid for each immune group five days after RSV challenge. results represent log2 endpoint values from four to five individual mice. data are representative of at least three independent experiments. G-specific CD4+IFN-+cells were detected in the lungs of Bac-RSV/G-immunized group. few specific cells (0.2% of CD4 T cells) were observed in the lungs of Bac-RSV/G-immunized group. cells gated for CD4 are shown in each dot plot. percentages represent the frequency of G-specific IFN--positive cells. results are a representative of two independent experiments. immunization of Bac-RSV/G prevented any detectable RSV replication in the lungs during peak of infection. this might be due to nonspecific innate immunity induced by baculovirus inoculation. each group of immune mice was challenged with 1106 PFU of RSV A2 at 4 weeks after immunization. intranasal Bac-RSV/G immunization promotes neither lung eosinophilia nor vaccine-induced eosinophilia. results suggest that intranasal Bac-RSV/G immunization barely increase the risk of vaccine-induced eosinophilia. baculovirus has been emerged as a new tool for vaccine vector development since it has many advantages as a vaccine platform. baculovirus has been used to overexpress recombinant proteins in insect cells. baculovirus is neither replication-competent nor pathogenic in mammalian cells. baculovirus has the ability to stimulate strong innate immunity, exhibiting strong adjuvanticity itself. it has been previously shown that inoculation of wild-type baculovirus alone can stimulate the secretion of inflammatory cytokines from innate immune cells. baculovirus-mediated stimulation of innate immunity might be associated with the induction of type I interferons. mice immunized with a recombinant vaccinia virus exhibit pulmonary eosinophilia induced by Th2 type cytokines after challenge RSV infection (6). cytokines are thought to promote eosinophil infiltration to the lungs of RSV-infected mice and may contribute to immunopathology associated with vaccine-enhanced diseases. vaccine could be developed as a mucosal RSV vaccine."}
