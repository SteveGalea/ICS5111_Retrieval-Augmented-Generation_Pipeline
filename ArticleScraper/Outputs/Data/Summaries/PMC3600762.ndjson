{"summary": "prepare Eagle's minimum essential medium containing 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids, 2 mM L-glutamine, and10 mM HEPES pH 7.4. thaw cells rapidly ( 1 min) in a 37 \u00b0C water bath. once with warmed 0.05% trypsin - 0.02% EDTA to remove excess medium and serum. remove the wash and add 1 ml of warmed trypsin per well to the cells. transfer the trypsinized cells to a 50 ml sterile conical tube. cells can take up to 3 weeks to reach 75-90% confluence. each transwell insert requires 2 105 cells. each transwell insert requires 2 105 cells. in a 50 ml sterile conical tube, dilute cells to a concentration of 2 106 viable cells/ml with EMEM-10%. to each of the remaining wells, add 100 l of resuspended cells. to each of the remaining wells, add 100 l of resuspended cells. from cell-free wells A1 and D1, remove basolateral medium from all wells. add 200 l of EMEM-10% to the apical compartment of cell-free wells. then to the seeded wells, directing the medium into the apical compartment. polarization is complete by performing a secondary assay. prepare non-fluorescent buffer (118 mM NaCl; 4.75 mM KCl; 2.53 mM CaCl2.2H2O; 2.44 mM MgSO4; 1.19 mM KH2PO4 in sterile water; sterile filter with 0.45 m filtration device) carefully remove medium from both the basolateral and apical compartments. add 600 l room-temperature sterile Dulbecco's PBS (D-PBS) to the basolateral compartments. add 100 l room-temperature sterile sterile D-PBS to the apical compartments. measure sample absorbance on an ELISA plate reader at 486 nm or 490 nm. measure sample absorbance on an ELISA plate reader at 486 nm or 490 nm. for uninfected wells, add 100 l of serum-free EMEM to the apical compartment of appropriate Transwells. for virus infection, dilute virus in serum-free EMEM and add 100 l to the apical compartments of appropriate Transwells. thaw cells rapidly ( 1 min) in a 37 \u00b0C water bath. transfer them to a 50 ml sterile conical tube. add 30 ml of warmed EMEM-20%+S. subculture from one well of a 6-well plate up to one T-25 cm2 flask. using 5 ml warmed trypsin per T-25 cm2 flask to detach cells, subculture from one T-25 cm2 flask up to one T-75 cm2 flask in a final volume of 5 ml of EMEM-20%+S. 105 cells contain 10% FBS (EMEM-10%) and warm in a water bath to 37 \u00b0C. prepare a 24-well Transwell plate for seeding. to maintain a homogeneous suspension of Calu-3 cells, gently agitate the cell suspension during this seeding step. incubate Transwell plate at 37 \u00b0C and 7% CO2 in air atmosphere. to improve the efficiency of polarization, do not stack plates on top of each other. trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) of Calu-3 LCC 30 min after medium changes. perform measurements with cell-free control wells A1 and D1 (the blanks) is the average measurement from a seeded well and blank is the average measurement from the 2 wells, A1 and D1, containing inserts and medium, but no cells. verify that polarization is complete by performing a secondary assay, measuring passive sodium fluorescein diffusion between the apical and basolateral compartments. incubate the plate at 37 \u00b0C for 1 hr. CO2 is not required during this incubation. prepare at least 8 different concentrations of sodium fluorescein, each in a final volume of at least 600 l. aspirate medium from cell-free wells A1 and D1, then from seeded wells. add 100 l of serum-free EMEM to the apical compartment of appropriate wells. add 100 l of serum-free EMEM to each well by angling the pipette against the wall of the compartment. the trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) of Calu-3 LCC reaches a plateau at or above 1,000 cm2 within 3 weeks after seeding. a modified sodium fluorescein equilibration assay is used to confirm polarization of Calu-3 LCC 15,17,18. the TEER of Calu-3 LCC plateaus at or above 1,000 cm2. the model is ready to be used to examine airway epithelial cell responses to respiratory pathogens. Exposure to RSV results in a more rapid decline in culture integrity compared to a mock-infection of cells. allow 2-3 weeks post-seeding for full resistance development Check the composition and pore size of inserts used, change if necessary Check the quality of the electrode, sanding gently to remove accumulated proteins from the tip, and replace if necessary Table 1. fluctuations in TEER measurements of Calu-3 LCC are normal from day to day. fluctuations in TEER are not expected until the culture naturally declines with age. the ability of Calu-3 LCC to polarize depends in part on how cells are maintained and subcultured before use in the Transwell system. the ability of the voltohmmeter to detect resistance in a culture that is actually polarized may also limited by protein buildup on the electrode leads. this build-up may be removed with gentle sanding, or may be corrected by replacing the electrode leads. Calu-3 LCC are ready for use as an in vitro model for characterizing host lung epithelial cell responses to respiratory infection. polarized epithelial cells respond in vitro to respiratory virus infection."}
