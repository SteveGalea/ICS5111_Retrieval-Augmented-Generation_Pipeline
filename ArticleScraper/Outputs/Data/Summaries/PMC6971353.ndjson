{"summary": "the environment, an essential composite of the life of poultry, can influence the efficiency of physiological response and the homeostasis balance. stress factors induce functional and morphological changes in birds. poor immune response is usually associated to stressor factors related to management conditions. some of the immunosuppressive viruses in turkeys are hemorrhagic enteritis virus (HEV), Marek\u2019s disease virus (MDV), Reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV), Orthoreovirus, Metapneumovirus, influenza virus, and Poult Enteritis Mortality syndrome (PEMS) resistance to the immunosuppression is interesting all Professionals of poultry industry are interested in better handling of immunosuppression. enteric viruses increase susceptibility of affected birds to secondary infections and others immunosuppressive diseases. in turkeys, most important enteric viral diseases are represented by hemorrhagic enteritis (HE), runting stunting syndrome (RSS) and PEMS. cytotoxic cells HE Siadenovirus -Atrophy BF -Hypertrophy of spleen -Depletion of B-cells -Apoptosis in spleen -Depletion of IgM bearing cells -Depletion of lymphoid organs -Depletion of B-cells and T-cells -Destruction of T and B-cells ND PMV-1 (Avulavirus) he is an acute disease of turkeys caused by siadenovirus (group II Aviadenovirus), immunosuppressive virus, which infect essentially animals at 4 weeks of age and older. in field outbreaks, mortality varied from 0.1% to 60%. virulent HEV strains are capable to induce apoptosis in spleen cells. transient immunosuppression has been reported during clinical phase of the disease. significant depletion of IgM-bearing B cells is observed in infected turkeys. depression in phytohemagglutinin (PHA) is also described in inoculated birds. hyperplasia of white pulp, lymphoid necrosis and intranuclear inclusion body within lymphoreticular body cells are the most described microscopic modifications. more severe lesions can be found in the gizzard, the proventiculus, the caeca tonsils and the bursa of Fabricius. RSS is a multifactorial syndrome affecting young chickens and turkeys. increased mortality, remarkable heterogeneity, aqueous diarrhea, and increased mortality are the most important alert clinical signs. many viruses are isolated from affected birds. poult enteritis-mortality syndrome PEMS is an infectious, transmissible, and multifactorial disease. it occurs in young turkeys aged from 1 week to weeks. etiology of the disease was attributed to toxins. Turkey coronavirus (TCoV) induces diarrhea, ruffled feathers and decreased feed and water consumption. villous atrophy and desquamation, catarrhal enteritis, and hemorrhagic infiltration. the implication of parvoviruses in complex enteric diseases has been reported in chicken and turkeys since 1980s. the cited viruses are detected in field cases of PEMS and \u201cLight Turkey syndrome\u201d in turkeys. MDV induces immunosuppression, involving humoral and cell-mediated immunity. effect is correlated with massive apoptosis of CD4+CD8+ thymocytes, leading to thymic atrophy and reduction in circulating CD4+ lymphocytes. the disease causes atrophy of the bursa of Fabricius and thymus. damage of T cells, reduction of lymphocyte T in peripheral blood, and suppression of splenic cells have been documented. aMPV is able to reduce reactions to phytohaemagglutinin and immune responses to sheep red cells in poults. infected animals showed lower thymus weight (Timms et al., 1986). aMPV can interfere with HEV vaccines and subsequently reduce immune response in turkeys. lymphoid organs masses (bursa, thymus, and spleen) contribute to objective evaluation. hematological investigations may provide heterophil:lymphocyte ration, as significant indicator of stress. determining cytokines levels to evaluate cellular immune response is well developed in mammals due to available commercial systems. microarray technology is performed to evaluate cellular immune response in poultry, by detecting genes involved in antiviral and pro-inflammatory cytokine responses. turkeys can be vaccinated against few immunosuppressive viral diseases, such as HE, ND, aMPV, and Reoviruses. the control of other immunosuppressive agents (bacteria, mycotoxins, parasites, and stress) must be considered. possible immunization of poults at the hatchery with Rispens strain is suggested. IFN- induces increase of antibody titer in turkeys immunized by NDV DNA vaccine. genetic resistance to MD is well documented, with focus on major histocompatibility complex. enteric viruses enteritis is a main problem in poultry, associated to considerable direct and indirect economic losses. enteric viruses increase susceptibility of affected birds to secondary infections and others immunosuppressive diseases. B-cell -Damage of T-cells -Suppression of cytotoxic cells HE Siadenovirus -Atrophy BF -Hypertrophy of spleen -Depletion of B-cells -Apoptosis in spleen -Depletion of lymphoid organs -Depletion of all lymphoid organs -Depletion of B-cells and T-cells - hemorrhagic enteritis and other adenoviruses HE is an acute disease of turkeys caused by Siadenovirus (group II Aviadenovirus), immunosuppressive virus. virulent HEV strains are capable to induce apoptosis in spleen cells due to the induction of interleukine-6 (IL-6) secretion in the spleen. immunosuppression is the consequence of the nitric acid production. a significant decrease in hemagglutination inhibition antibody titers is detected in infected turkeys. depression in phytohemagglutinin (PHA) is also described in inoculated birds. hyperplasia of the white pulp, lymphoid necrosis and intranuclear inclusion body within lymphoreticular body cells are the most described microscopic modifications. more severe lesions can be found in the gizzard, the proventiculus, the caeca tonsils and the bursa of Fabricius. enteric viruses increase susceptibility of affected birds to secondary infections and others immunosuppressive diseases. in turkeys, the most important enteric viral diseases are represented by hemorrhagic enteritis (HE), runting stunting syndrome (RSS) and PEMS. thymus and spleen -Destruction in early stages: B-cells and CD4+ T-cells -Transformation of T-cells RE Gammaretrovirus -Atrophy BF, thymus and spleen -Destruction of B-cells -Damage of T-cells -Suppression of cytotoxic cells HE Siadenovirus -Atrophy BF -Hypertrophy of hemorrhagic enteritis and other adenoviruses HE is an acute disease of turkeys caused by Siadenovirus (group II Aviadenovirus), immunosuppressive virus, which infect essentially animals at 4 weeks of age and older. in field outbreaks, mortality varied from 0.1% to 60%. cytokines (IL-6, interferon type I and II, and TNF) production. transient immunosuppression has been reported during clinical phase of the disease. a significant decrease in hemagglutination inhibition antibody titers is detected in infected turkeys. spleen may be smaller and pale because of blood loss and subsequent splenic contraction. hyperplasia of white pulp, lymphoid necrosis and intranuclear inclusion body within lymphoreticular body cells are the most described microscopic modifications. more severe lesions can be found in the gizzard, the proventiculus, the caeca tonsils and the bursa of Fabricius. virulent strains of avian Reovirus cause atrophy of lymphoid tissues and interfere with humoral immunity. effects on immune system are more severe when associated to aflatoxins. atrophy is not caused by Reovirus tropism specifically for lymphocytes. edema, hyperplasia of the epithelium, and lymphoid depletion are dominated. affected flocks appear with high heterogeneity, diarrhea, and increase in mortality. enteric coronavirus (TCoV) induces diarrhea, ruffled feathers, decreased feed and water consumption in addition to poor growth rate. a distinct group has been detected in the subfamily of Dependovirinae. genetic studies revealed differences between chicken and turkey\u2019s parvovirus strains. the implication of parvoviruses in complex enteric diseases has been reported in chicken and turkeys since 1980s. in chickens, parvoviruses are isolated from RSS outbreaks. transient immunosuppression is described from three to seven days post inoculation. the infection of T lymphocytes induces necrosis of cells and consequently an immunosuppression. this effect is correlated with massive apoptosis of CD4+CD8+ thymocytes. REV induces neoplastic disease, which may be similar to MD and lymphoid leucosis (LL) the disease sporadically appears to cause significant death and condemnation loss in commercial turkey flocks and is a potential contaminant of vaccine viruses. serotype 2 is isolated from normally chickens and contains pathogenic strains. serotype 3 includes apathogenic strains, represented particularly by the Herpes Virus of Turkey strain, used as heterologous vaccine. reticuloendotheliosis (REV) is an important immunosuppressive disease of turkeys and chickens. the disease sporadically appears to cause significant death and condemnation loss in commercial turkey flocks. Newcastle disease (ND) is a worldwide disease causing severe economic losses. aMPV is the causal agent of turkey rhinotracheitis (TRT) immunosuppression leads to degradation of performances, with poor feed conversion, decrease in growth rate, heterogeneity, low weight, and increased mortality. depressed animals are more susceptible to develop bacterial and parasitic secondary infections, which areaccompanied by increased mortality. in vitro lymphocyte proliferation response to mitogen is widely used to evaluate the integrity of cell-mediated immunity. lymphoproliferative response to phytohemagglutinin phosphate is performed as an indicator of a T-cell-induced delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction. control of viral-induced immunosuppression The main objective is to prevent economic losses caused by viral immunosuppressive infection. turkeys can be vaccinated against few immunosuppressive viral diseases, such as HE, ND, aMPV, and aMPV. the development of vaccination against aMPV interest chickens. TCoV was identified as the causative agent of bluecomb disease of turkey poults over 50 years ago. vaccines are not available to control the disease. genetic selection birds for optimal immune response to used vaccines may complete optimizing natural resistance to viral diseases. selection for enhanced innate immunity is possible because of the existence of toll-like receptors in chickens and turkeys. avian veterinarians are fundamental in term of early detection of immunosuppression. they will be challenged with emergent viruses and immunosuppressive in particular, in turkey industry. the development of new controlling methods is still being tested."}
