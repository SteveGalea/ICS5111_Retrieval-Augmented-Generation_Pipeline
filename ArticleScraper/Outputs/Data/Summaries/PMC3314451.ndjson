{"summary": "rat sarcoma cells grow well in mouse brain parenchyma but not when transplanted under the skin or into muscle. the view that the CNS is completely ignored by the immune system has turned out to be overly simplistic. this is in part because immune privilege is relative rather than absolute. the brain is the most highly protected organ in the body. it is protected from physical insult by the skull and associated tissues. the glia limitans form a further barrier between blood and neuronal tissue. cells share morphological characteristics, gene expression patterns, and ability to present antigen with splenic DCs. this all changes in the inflamed CNS or retina when myeloid (CD11b+) DCs flood into the site, amplify the immune response, and promote epitope spreading. the phenotype permits trafficking through extra-lymphoid tissue. Activated lymphocytes make formal contact with the BBB via 4-integrin and endothelial VCAM-1 (27) and cross the barrier by diapedesis. entry to the leptomeningeal compartment is dependent on further encounter with cognate antigen. the migration of leukocytes into the CNS may be modulated by sequestration of CXCL12 by other receptors. blockade of CXCR4 allows CD4 T cells to escape from their perivascular containment and penetrate deeper into brain parenchyma. treatment with natalizumab increases the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) caused by the John Cunningham (JC) Virus. the precise origin of the reactivation is difficult to determine. in animal models, latent virus can be detected in the trigeminal ganglion and hypothalamus (38). examples of viruses causing immunopathology in the CNS include eastern equine encephalitis virus in humans. a poor CD8 antiviral response to the virus results in a high number of infected and activated CD4 T cells. a high percentage of these cells is able to enter the CNS. the latter secrete inflammatory cytokines and metalloproteinases, and these cause tissue damage in a bystander fashion. anti-dsDNA antibodies can cross-react with NMDA receptor on the cell surface and induce apoptosis of neurons in the hippocampus and lateral amygdala (47). the integrity of the BBB and BCSFB means that this rarely manifests as a clinical feature of either the infection or autoimmune condition. similar findings have been described in animal models of herpesvirus infection. in this latter model, it was possible to demonstrate lytic granule-dependent degradation of viral protein without concomitant neuronal cell death. these studies suggest the immune system can control CNS infections using mechanisms that limit tissue damage. autoimmune diseases of the CNS are characterized by strong association with genes, usually class II, in the MHC (54); weak association with a range of other genes encoding proteins known to regulate immune responses (55); lymphocyte infiltration of the affected tissue (56); raised levels of class-switched autoantibodies in serum or the affected tissue (57); and suppression of disease progression through treatment with strong immune-suppressive drugs (59). MS is more common in populations of mixed European descent, whereas NMO is relatively more frequent in individuals not of mixed European descent. narcolepsy is an autoimmune disease of the CNS that shares some of the features with MS but is distinct both genetically and in immunopathology. a subtle, local bystander activation mechanism could account for the specific depletion of hypothalamic neurons producing hypocretin peptides. the available therapies for many autoimmune diseases are not curative and are often associated with unacceptable side effects. the available therapies for many autoimmune diseases are not curative and are often associated with unacceptable side effects. the holy grail for treatment of autoimmune disease is to design a drug that will selectively target the cells causing the disease, avoid nonspecific immune suppression, and have minimal adverse effects. there is no doubt that MS is an autoimmune disease associated with the adaptive immune response to myelin antigens. PML is caused by the reactivation of the JC Virus polyomavirus in the CNS of immune-compromised individuals (82). similar viral complications may also arise upon treatment with fingolimod (Gilenya), a sphingosine-1 phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator. fingolimod significantly lowered relapse rate in relapsing-remitting MS. high doses of APL, based on MBP peptide 83\u201399, caused allergic complications when injected subcutaneously (89) high-dose treatment with MBP peptide 82\u201398 led to a reduction in anti-MBP antibodies and delayed disease progression in the HLA-DR2/DR4 subgroup. depletion of immune cells may lead to virus reactivation. cross-reacting antibodies arise as a result of infection, autoimmune disease, or cancer."}
