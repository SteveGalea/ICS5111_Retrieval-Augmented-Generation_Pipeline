{"summary": "PDCoV is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus. it belongs to the subfamily Coronavirinae within the order Nidovirales. PDCoV could cause acute diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration and even lead to death in nursing piglets. the mortality rate of neonatal piglets comes up to 100%, especially in piglets no more than 2 weeks of age. swine farms in different cities broke out diarrhea diseases in different ages of pigs with high mortality in suckling piglets. farm C was a 300-sow breed-to-finisher farm in Zhoukou city of Henan Province. watery diarrhea and vomit was first found in sows, and by the following day the newborn piglets showed acute, watery diarrhea with high mortality rate. the disease spread to all pigs in the farms. three suckling piglets from each swine farm were chosen to necropsy. intestinal sections, small intestinal content (SIC), tissues of heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, intestines, inguinal lymph node and serum were collected. the samples were centrifuged at 1847 g at 4\u00b0C for 20 min. primers of PDCoV S gene were designed to amplify the 3692 bp of S gene on the conditions of 95\u00b0C for 3 min followed by 35 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s, 58\u00b0C for 15 s, 72\u00b0C for 4 min and finally 72\u00b0C for 5 min. a pair of primers and TaqMan probe were designed based on the M gene sequence of PDCoV in GenBank. the forward primer was 5\u2032-CTATGTCTGACGCAGAAGAGAGTG-3\u2032 and the reverse primer was 5\u2032-GATGTGCCTTATTGCA-3\u2032. the probe was 5\u2032-FAM-ATGGGTACATGTGTGCATTCCC-TAMRA-3\u2032. fixed tissues were embedded, sectioned, and stained with Mayer\u2019s H.E. the length of ten villi and crypts of jejunum was measured and the mean of jejunum villous height: crypt depth was calculated as described. clinical samples were collected from three swine farms with high mortality rate in suckling piglets. farm A was a 300-sow breed-to-finisher farm in Zhumadian city of Henan Province. farm B was a 300-sow breed-to-finisher farm in Zhoukou City of Henan Province. d pigs, 12 fecal samples of fattening pigs and 15 fecal samples of sows were collected from farm B. intestinal sections, small intestinal content (SIC), tissues of heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, intestines, inguinal lymph node and serum were collected during the suckling piglets necropsy. Primers of PDCoV, PEDV, TGEV and PoRVA/B/C were synthetized. the primers were shown in Table 1. Table 1. Primers used for amplification of viruses. sequenced S genes were assembled with DNAStar Lasergene 7.0. they were then used in sequence alignment and phylogenetic analyses. a pair of primers and TaqMan probe were designed to develop a TaqMan qRT-PCR method. the detection limit of TaqMan real-time RT-PCR was 3.7 log10 GE/mL for the original fecal sample. the small intestines (duodenum and ileum) and large intestines (cecum and colon) and other major organs, including lung, heart, kidney and spleen were examined grossly. fixed tissues were embedded, sectioned, and stained with Mayer\u2019s H.E. sections were incubated with biotinylated secondary antibodies at 37\u00b0C in a humidified chamber for 1 h. sections were washed three times with PBS after each incubation step. positive cells were visualized with the treatment of diaminobenzidine. fecal samples SIC of suckling piglets suckling piglets weaned pigs fattening pigs sows Farm A 8*/8 8*/10 10*/13 13*/16 8*/8 Farm B 8*/10 6*/12 6*/12 9*/15 5*/6 Farm C 12*/15 6*/13 8*/17 10*/16 6*/6 Total 28*/33 20*/35 24*/42 32*/47 19*/20 * the phylogenetic tree was constructed and analyzed using the neighbor-joining method of MEGA 6.0 software. the phylogenetic tree was constructed and analyzed using the neighbor-joining method of MEGA 6.0 software. PDCoV RNA distributed systemically with various copies among tissues. high PDCoV RNA copies were detected in ileum, inguinal lymph node, rectum and spleen. the highest PDCoV RNA copy was detected in ileum. PDCoV antigen was detected in cytoplasm of villous enterocytes in jejunum and ileum. duodenum and cecum also showed PDCoV positive by IHC staining slightly. five SIC samples of six suckling piglets were positive for PDCoV. in farm C, six SIC samples of six suckling piglets were positive for PDCoV. 36/61 fecal samples were positive for PDCoV which included 12/15 fecal samples of suckling piglets. the infected pigs had vomit and diarrhea symptoms, but some sows infected with PDCoV showed transient diarrhea only lasting for 1 day. RT-PCR results of PEDV, TGEV, SADS-CoV and PoRVA/B/C detection were all negative. piglets showed thin and transparent intestinal walls from colon to caecum (arrows) PDCoV distribution in different tissues of the piglets was examined by Taqman real-time RT-PCR. high PDCoV RNA copies were detected in ileum, inguinal lymph node, rectum and spleen. sections of middle jejunum to caecum showed diffuse intestinal villus blunting, fusion and enterocyte attenuation. no lesions were seen in other organs. PDCoV was reported in Ohio of U.S.A. in february 2014 that with diarrhea in sows and piglets. another PDCoV infection was reported in Thailand, with acute diarrhea in piglets, gilts and sows. PDCoV was the main pathogen of diarrhea in these swine farms. previous reports showed that PDCoV was observed mainly in the small and large intestines, like the PEDV and TGEV infection, and could be detected in multiple organs. PDCoV viral RNA was also detected in intestines, heart, spleen, lung, kidney and many other organs by Taqman real-time RT-PCR [30,31] coV can lead to diarrhea, wasting and other clinical symptoms. PDCoV could infect ages of farmed pigs with watery diarrhea. authors declare there are no competing interests associated with the manuscript."}
