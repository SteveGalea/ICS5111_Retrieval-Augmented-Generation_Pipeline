{"summary": "PCV2 triggers a weak and atypical innate immune response. key genes and mechanisms by which the virus interfere with host immunity have not yet been elucidated. genes that control the response of primary porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) were profiled in vitro. PCV2 may prevent apoptosis in PAMs by up-regulating SERPINB9 expression, possibly to lengthen the duration of PCV2 replication-permissive conditions. the observed gene expression profile may provide insights into the immunological response and pathological changes that occur in pigs. the presence of granulomatous inflammation and multinucleated giant cells in PMWS pigs suggests a significant role for secreted cytokines and other immune-related signaling factors. previous studies have investigated the cytokine and chemokine gene expression profile of PMWS by transcriptomic and genomic analyses. but these results can not fully illustrate the pathogenesis of PCV2. there were no significant differences in the levels of viral DNA or virus particles between the two time points. no significant differences in the levels of viral DNA or virus particles were detected in the mock-inoculated PAMs at any of the experimental time points. 266 and 175 genes were differentially expressed from baseline at 24 HPI and 48 HPI. the majority of these genes were related to Immune Response, Inflammatory Response, Antigen Processing and Presentation of Peptide or Polysaccharide Antigen via MHC Class II, Anti-viral Immune response, Cell Motility, and Negative Regulation of Apoptosis.

IL-8 (340.09 53.64 vs 77.43 13.15, by 46-fold; Figure 3D) levels were significantly higher in supernatants of PCV2-inoculated PAMs at 24 HPI (23-fold vs. mock-inoculated PAMs; Figure 3B-C). interferon-gamma (IFN), however, appeared to be significantly down-regulated (552.87 83.25 vs 889.99 141.0 an effective vaccine was created by merial in 2005 (Circovac\u00ae; Merial, France) [24] and entered into widespread use in 2009. molecular mechanisms underlying PMWS and porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS) caused by PCV2 remain largely unknown. monocytic CD14 signaling is usually activated upon exposure to bacterial LPS. this molecule\u2019s up-regulation may induce ineffective antibacterial immunity. similar mechanism has been demonstrated in human monocytic cells upon exposure to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus. apoptosis and growth arrest Apoptosis is considered to be an important host mechanism that interrupts viral replication and eliminates virus-infected cells. apoptosis and growth arrest Apoptosis is considered to be an important host mechanism that interrupts viral replication and eliminates virus-infected cells. actively proliferating fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells have low levels of ACTA2. inhibition of cell proliferation by density arrest or treatment with antimitotic agents induces the smooth muscle -actin promoter. same phenomenon was found in Rhabdomyosarcoma cells after EV71 infection. PMWS-affected pigs present with increased expression of MIP-1, CCL-2, IL-1, IL-8, and TNF-mRNA in lymphoid tissues and PBMCs. SAA1, TNF-, and IL-1 up-regulation after PCV2 infection suggests the occurrence of systemic inflammation following PCV2 infection. increased production of TNF- may induce fever and respiratory distress in PCV2-infected pigs. IL-8 is a chemoattractant for neutrophils and other polymorphonuclear leukocytes. it is also known to trigger tight adhesion of monocytes to vascular endothelium. repressed expression may be indicative of suppressed Th1 responses. at the late stage of in vitro infection, however, the IFN expression level increased. toll-like receptors are essential sensors of microbial infection that are involved in the recognition of a variety of microbial products. up-regulation may contribute to increased sensitivity of macrophages to other pathogens. but an over-stimulation of the innate response could result in tissue damage. however, only a few cell types express MHC class II molecules. SERPINB9 belongs to the superfamily of serine proteinase inhibitors. it acts to protect against granzyme B-mediated apoptosis. BNIP3 was also found to be increased in PCV2-infected PAMs. the same phenomenon was found in Rhabdomyosarcoma cells after EV71 infection. it has been implicated in tumorigenicity of human breast carcinoma cells. up-regulation of this gene may enhance growth arrest in PCV2-infected cells, thereby culminating in cell death. PCV2-infected pigs showed up-regulation of MIP-1, CCL-2, IL-1, IL-8 and TNF- mRNA expression. cytokine is known to be important chemokine for recruitment of monocytes from the blood. inflammatory cells in injured tissue are regulated by various cytokines and chemokines. interaction of IL-8 and MCP-1/CCL-2 is also known to trigger tight adhesion of monocytes to vascular endothelium under flow conditions. chemokine AMCF-II/CXCL5 is a powerful chemoattractant for monocytes and its activities can be further enhanced by IL-8 [61] expression of 266 and 175 PAM genes was altered after 24 and 48 hours of PCV2 infection. several genes related to the inflammatory response were up-regulated. this work established a comprehensive differential transcription profile of early and late PCV2 infection in PAMs. the cells were thawed and cultured for 48 h before treatment. the first was infected with PCV2-WH from the 11th passage. the second was mock-inoculated with DMEM to serve as a control. the reaction was run in a real-time thermocycler (7500 PCR System; Applied BioSystems Inc.) at 24 HPI and 48 HPI, the cells were collected for RNA extraction with the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies, USA) the extracted RNA was further purified with an RNA clean-up kit (Macherey-Nagel, Germany) a spot-exclusion method was adopted to filter out faint spots, with signal intensities in the lowest 50%, and exclude the corresponding genes from further analysis. each experiment was conducted with the corresponding dye swap. the score is the probability that a collection of proteins equal to or greater than the number in a network could be achieved by chance alone. a score of 3 indicates that there is a 1/1000 chance that the focus proteins are in a network due to random chance. the score of 3 or higher have a 99.9% confidence of not being generated by random chance alone. the secreted protein levels of IFN, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF were determined by testing culture supernatants with the respective commercial ELISA kits. all samples were tested in triplicate and read at 450 nm using an ELISA plate reader. differences between groups were assessed by one-way repeated measures analysis of variance followed by Tukey\u2019s multiple comparison tests. the cells were thawed and cultured for 48 h before treatment. the first was infected with PCV2-WH from the 11th passage. the second was mock-inoculated with DMEM to serve as a control. the reaction was run in a real-time thermocycler (7500 PCR System; Applied BioSystems Inc.) at 24 HPI and 48 HPI, the cells were collected for RNA extraction with the TRIzol reagent. the extracted RNA was further purified with an RNA clean-up kit (Macherey-Nagel, Germany) a spot-exclusion method was adopted to filter out faint spots. an intensity-dependent LOWESS program was used to normalize the two-channel ratio values. each experiment was conducted with the corresponding dye swap. the score is the probability that a collection of proteins equal to or greater than the number in a network could be achieved by chance alone. a score of 3 indicates that there is a 1/1000 chance that the focus proteins are in a network due to random chance. inoculated PAMs by using the formula of 2-delta-delta Ct described by Livak and Schmittgen [75] the secreted protein levels of IFN, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF were determined by testing culture supernatants with the respective commercial ELISA kits.
