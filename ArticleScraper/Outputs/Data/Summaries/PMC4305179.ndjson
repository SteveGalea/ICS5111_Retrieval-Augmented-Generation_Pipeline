{"summary": "mouse care and experimental procedures were performed under pathogen-free conditions in accordance with established institutional guidance. female mice were used for all studies. three to four mice were used in each experimental group. the antisera reacted specifically with the chemokine and blocked T-cell migration in vivo in previous studies. 34, 35 SCID mice were injected intraperitoneally with 0.5 mL of anti-CXCL9 or control rabbit serum every other day. three days later, mononuclear cells were purified from each group of mice. phorbol myristate acetate and ionomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) were incubated with PerCP-conjugated anti-CD3 mAb (clone 145-2C11), followed by fixation and permeabilization with Cytofix/Cytoperm Plus kit. cells were stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti\u2013IFN- (XMG1.2) or isotype control (R3-34) m sagittal sections of the brains were deparaffinized, subjected to antigen retrieval in a microwave oven. the slides were then incubated with polyclonal rat anti-T. gondii serum (from a Sprague-Dawley rat 2 months after infection with CT 1 strain38) mRNA was isolated from a half brain of each of the infected SCID and IFN-/ mice at the last day of sulfadiazine treatment. the total RNA was pretreated with DNase I to remove genomic DNA contaminating the RNA preparations and then applied for cDNA synthesis. immune T cells in combination with anti-CXCL9 or control serum, at 5 days after discontinuation of sulfadiazine. quantification of mRNA for tachyzoite-specific SAG1 and bradyzoite-specific BAG1 was performed as previously described. a total of 1 107 immune T cells were injected intravenously into sulfadiazine-treated SCID mice at 3 to 5 weeks after infection. antisera reacted specifically with the chemokine and blocked T-cell migration in vivo in previous studies. mAb to CD4 (clone RM4-5) and fluorescein isothiocyanate- or peridinin-chlorophyll-protein complex (PerCP)-conjugated mAb to CD8 (clone 53-6.7) as described previously. 37 Isotype control antibodies were used as negative controls. cells purified from the brains were stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate and ionomycin (Sigma- LB/c mice stained with perCP-conjugated mAb to CD3, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated mAb to CD4, phycoerythrin-conjugated mAb to CD8, and allophycocyanin-conjugated anti-CD183 mAb (clone CXCR3-173) as described. 37 Isotype control antibodies were used as negative controls. the slides were applied to incubation with peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rat IgG antibodies. three or four sections, at least 50 m apart, were stained in each brain. numbers of foci associated with at least three CD3+ T cells were counted microscopically. IFN-/ mice were injected in 0.2 mL of saline every other day. as a control, IFN-/ mice were injected in the same manner. RNA was isolated from their brains, and amounts of mRNA for the chemokines were measured in the same manner. IFN- is important for inducing migration of immune T cells into the brains of chronically infected BALB/c mice. it is possible that IFN- production by innate immune cells plays an important role in inducing expression of the chemokine(s) that mediates recruitment of the T cells into the brains of the infected mice. cerebral expression of mRNA for CXCL9, but not for CXCL10 and CCL5, require IFN- during reactivation of infection with Toxoplasma gondii. mRNA in the brains of SCID mice on day 5 were 30 times greater than amounts on day 0 (P 0.05), whereas IFN-mRNA were undetectable in the brains of IFN-/ mice. sulfadiazine-treated sulfadiazine-treated IFN-/ mice were treated with recombinant IFN-/ mice. sulfadiazine-treated IFN-/ mice were treated with recombinant IFN-. the cerebral expression of CXCL9, CXCL10, and CCL5 mRNA was measured at 1 day after the final treatment. mRNA amounts were five times greater in the mice treated with recombinant IFN- than in mice treated with saline. sulfadiazine-treated mice received 1 107 immune T cells. sulfadiazine-treated mice were treated with anti-CXCL9 serum every other day. 1 107 total T cells were injected intravenously into the SCID mice at 3 to 5 weeks after infection. Mice were also injected intraperitoneally with 0.5 mL of anti-CXCL9 serum or control rabbit serum every other day. three days after the T-cell transfer, sulfadiazine treatment was discontinued. number of IFN-+CD3+ T cells in the brains of mice treated with control serum were one-half of those in the brains of mice treated with anti-CXCL9. therefore, CXCL9 is important for recruiting immune T cells capable of producing IFN- into the brain during the early stage of reactivation of T. gondii infection. T. gondii infection up-regulates CXCR3 expression on both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the spleen. each of the splenic T cells purified from their brains did not have two distinct populations, CXCR3+ and CXCR3. it has been shown that CXCL9 and the two other CXCR3 ligands induce down-regulation of CXCR3 expression on T cells. the spleen cells were gated on CD3+CD4+ or CD3+CD8+ T cells. each of these gated cell populations was analyzed for their CXCR3 expression. mRNA in the former were 9.5 times less than those detected in the brains of mice that did not receive T cells (P 0.01) these results strongly suggest that T-cell recruitment mediated by CXCL9 is critical for preventing tachyzoite growth during reactivation of chronic infection with T. gondii in the brain. tachyzoite-containing foci associated with CD3+ T cells per sagittal section. a representative image of the foci contained destroyed tachyzoites. n = 4 mice in each experimental group. numbers of foci associated with tachyzoites were 4.2 times greater in the brains of SCID mice that had received immune T cells in combination with anti-CXCL9 serum treatment. only the latter had significantly fewer foci associated with tachyzoites than did control mice that had received no T cells (P 0.05) foci with tachyzoite proliferation in the anti-CXCL9 serum-treated mice were often associated with necrosis of brain tissue. CXCL9 is crucial for inducing an accumulation of immune T cells into the areas where tachyzoites started proliferating. cerebral expression of any of these three chemokines is induced by IFN- produced by innate immune cells during reactivation of cerebral T. gondii infection. expression of mRNA for CXCL9, CXCL10, and CCL5 and for IFN- and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- in their brains was examined on the last day of sulfadiazine treatment (day 0) and on day 3 and day 5. cerebral expression of mRNA for CXCL9, but not for CXCL10 and CCL5, require IFN- during reactivation of infection with Toxoplasma gondii. increased cerebral expression of mRNA for CXCL9, but not for CXCL10 and CCL5. the cerebral expression of CXCL9 and CXCL10 increased in a similar manner in both SCID and IFN-/ mice. no differences were found in the amounts of CCL5 mRNA between these two strains of mice on each of day 3 and day 5. TNF- mRNA amounts were 6.3 times greater in the brains of IFN-/ mice on day 5 than on day 0. no increase was found in CCL5 mRNA amounts with treatment with recombinant IFN-. this results further support the IFN-\u2013dependent expression of CXCL9 in the brains during cerebral infection with T. gondii. percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in mononuclear cells purified from the brain were significantly lower in the SCID mice treated with anti-CXCL9 serum. numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the cell preparations were five and three times less in the former than in the latter. sulfadiazine treatment was discontinued to initiate reactivation of cerebral infection with toxoplasma gondii. CD8+ T cells in the cell preparations were determined by flow cytometry. data are expressed as means SDs from triplicated staining in each experimental group. CXCR3 is expressed on the surface of both CD4+ and CD8+ T-Cell Populations in the Spleens of BALB/c Mice Chronically Infected with T. gondii CXCL9. we examined an expression of CXCR3 on the surface of splenic CD4+ and CD8+ immune T cells of chronically infected BALB/c mice. median fluorescence intensity for CXCR3 was close to the cutoff value to distinguish CXCR3+ and CXCR3 populations of the splenic T cells. it has been shown that CXCL9 and the two other CXCR3 ligands induce down-regulation of CXCR3 expression on T cells. most of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that migrated into the brains of infected mice were originally CXCR3+. neutralization of CXCL9 by anti-CXCL9 serum inhibited recruitment of immune T cells into the brain during reactivation of infection with T. gondii. we examined the amounts of mRNA for tachyzoite-specific SAG1 in the brains of infected SCID mice. a total of 1 107 total T cells were injected intravenously into the SCID mice at 3 to 5 weeks after infection. at 5 days after discontinuation of sulfadiazine, RNA was purified from their brains. numbers of foci associated with tachyzoites per sagittal section were counted microscopically. n = 4 mice in each experimental group. P 0.05, P 0.01, and P 0.001. mRNA for bradyzoite-specific BAG1 in brains of infected SCID mice. most of the foci associated with tachyzoites in the SCID mice contained only small numbers of tachyzoites or fragments of the parasite. those foci were often associated with inflammatory cells, including CD3+ T cells that infiltrated into the areas of tachyzoite growth. this chemokine is crucial for recruiting immune T cells into the brains of chronically infected wild-type BALB/c mice. the protein amount of the CXCL9 is the highest among these three chemokines in their brains,27. in infection with mouse hepatitis virus, CXCL9 is important for mediating T-cell recruitment and host defense against the virus. the expression of CXCL9 increases in the brain only during the later stage of T. gondii infection. mortality during the acute stage is associated with parasite growth in the peripheral organs. a recent study found that increased mortality to acute infection with the parasite occurs in CXCR3-knockout mice after oral but not intraperitoneal infection. despite sharing the identical receptor, each of CXCL9 and CXCL10 is important for resistance to infections in the brain with mouse hepatitis virus34, 50 and herpes simplex virus-251. each of these two chemokines is involved in the development of cerebral murine malaria, in which CD8+ T cells play an important pathogenic role. IFN- regulates T-cell infiltration into the brain by inducing an expression of both the adhesion molecule and the chemokine critical for the T-cell migration into the brain to prevent tachyzoite growth."}
