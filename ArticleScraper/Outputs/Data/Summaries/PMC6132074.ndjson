{"summary": "Inoculation with experimental neurotropic strains JHM and MHV-A59 induces a biphasic disease with acute meningoencephalitis (in first 10\u201314 days post inoculation) both JHM and MHV-A59 strains cause some subacute and chronic inflammatory demyelination in the brain. studies of isogenic recombinant strains RSA59 and RSMHV2 have elaborated the mechanisms of demyelination and axonal loss. MHV accesses the CNS through the olfactory nerve and spreads from the olfactory system into structures of the limbic system and their brainstem connections. this has led investigators to suggest that interneuronal transport is one mechanism of viral spread during acute encephalitis. delivery of large molecular weight biological therapies to the CNS via intranasal administration has been explored. spread of smaller peptides through rodent brain occurs rapidly, with diffuse brain distribution and greatest levels found in olfactory bulbs and trigeminal nerves. 66 proteins were detected in the vitreous and the optic nerve at markedly higher concentrations than in the brain. if such pathways are present, the rapid spread of virus could provide an additional mechanism for immune evasion. mice were inoculated with RSA59 and RSMHV2 as control. RSMHV2 (1000 PFU) were used to inoculate 4-week-old, MHV-free, C57BL/6J mice. mice were inoculated intracranially as a positive control for disease pathogenesis with RSA59. mice mock-infected with PBS were also inoculated intracranially. 0-no demyelination; 1-rare foci of demyelination; 2-a few foci of demyelination; 3-large (confluent) areas of demyelination. all slides were coded and read in a blinded manner. retinas were incubated for 1 h with alexa fluor-488 anti-goat secondary antibody diluted 1:500. retinas were then washed and mounted with vectashield mounting medium. images of RGCs were taken in 12 standardized fields at 1/6, 3/6, and 5/6 of the retinal radius from the center of the retina. mice mock-infected with RSA59 were inoculated intracranially. animals were euthanized at day 1 post-inoculation (p.i.) and day 26 p.i. mice mock-infected with RSA59 were also inoculated. serial sections from eye, optic nerve, and brain stained by avidin-biotin-immunoperoxidase technique (Vector Laboratories) using 3, 3- diaminobenzidine as substrate. 1:40 dilution of antiviral nucleocapsid antiserum (mouse monoclonal anti-N; nucleocapsid protein of MHV-JHM, monoclonal clone 1-16-1, Kind pathology was assessed from LFB stained cross-sections of spinal cord isolated from mice at day 26 (peak of demyelination) p.i. RSA59, when injected intracranially, induced significant myelin loss within formed demyelinating plaques. serial thoracic, cervical and lumbar cross sections of spinal cord from post-inoculation day 26 intranasally mock-infected (A\u2013C), RSA59-infected (D\u2013F) and RSMHV2-infected mice were stained with LFB. average demyelination score is 1.33 0.2357; (mean SE) (M); data comparisons were done by one-way ANOVA and Tukey's Multiple Comparison post-hoc testing s were observed in optic nerve sections of RSA59 infected mice when injected intranasally. s were comparable to RSMHV2 and mock infected mice. intracranially RSA59-infected mice had significantly fewer surviving RGCs compared to mock-infected mice. mice inoculated intracranially with either RSA59 (B) or RSMHV2 did not show RGC loss (D) mice were inoculated intranasally with 50% of the LD50 dose of RSA59 or RSMHV2. mice were isolated, sectioned, and immunostained with anti-viral nucleocapsid antisera. no significant staining was observed in retinas or optic nerves from mock-infected mice. EGFP fluorescence detected for virus presence in olfactory bulb sections shows no detectable viral antigen in retina or optic nerve. olfactory bulb sections stained with anti-iba-1 antibody showed some positive cells and clusters of cells in an RSA59 infected mouse. anti-viral nucleocapsid positive cells are present in the RGC layer (top arrow) and inner nuclear layer (bottom arrow) of the retina from a mouse intracranially-inoculated with RSA59 (N), but not mice inoculated with RSMHV2 (O). intracranial, but not intranasal, inoculation with RSA59 induces spinal cord demyelination Four week old C57BL6/J mice intranasally mock-infected mice and intracranially RSA59-inoculated mice were stained with LFB. average demyelination score is 1.33 0.2357; (mean SE); n = 9/group; data comparison was done by one-way ANOVA and Tukey's Multiple Comparison post-hoc testing. RSA59 induced significant myelin loss with demyelinating plaques in optic nerves. similar to spinal cord, little or no demyelinating plaques were observed in optic nerve sections of RSA59 infected mice. retinas were isolated from the same mice shown in Figure 1. intracranially RSA59-infected mice had significantly fewer surviving RGCs compared to mock-infected mice. mice inoculated intracranially with RSA59 (B) did not show RGC loss (D) the potential for MHV viruses to similarly spread to optic nerve and retina was assessed 1 day following intranasal inoculation. mice were inoculated intranasally with 50% of the LD50 dose of RSA59 or RSMHV2. mice were isolated, sectioned, and immunostained with anti-viral nucleocapsid antisera to detect viral spread. sections from mock-infected mice showed resting levels of microglial staining. Iba-1 staining did not reveal any increased numbers of microglia/macrophages in optic nerve sections following intranasal viral inoculation as compared to mock-infected. FP fluorescence detected for virus presence in olfactory bulb sections shows high background in mock-infected mice (J), which prevented this from being quantified. but demonstrates some positive cells and clusters of cells in an RSA59 infected mouse (K) the resting number and morphology of Iba-1 positive cells in mock-infected mice (C) spinal cord and optic nerve pathology observed after intracranial inoculation of RSA59 were not reported. intranasal infection by RSA59 at the same dose used for intracranial inoculation was not able to induce any neuropathogenesis in optic nerve or spinal cord. intranasal inoculation may be less effective for inducing optic neuritis and retinal lesions than intracerebral route. the precise mechanisms mediating spread of a virus or a drug from the nose to various CNS regions are not fully elucidated. at least three steps are necessary following intranasal administration. the path from there to optic nerve is not direct, and therefore may require much higher titers of virus to occur at a pathologic level. the drug ST266 and other small molecules can be found in optic nerve as early as 30 min post intranasal inoculation. this suggests that viral particle may be too large or complex to follow the same pathway. interest statement The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
