{"summary": "the newly emerged Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes severe pneumonia and renal failure in infected patients. the symptoms are similar to those caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the latter of which led to over 8,000 infections and a fatality rate of 10% during the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic. tensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) are comprised of a core structure and a receptor-binding motif (RBM) the core structures of these two RBDs are highly similar, but their RBMs are significantly different. following receptor binding, the S2 subunit of the spike protein undergoes a dramatic conformational change to fuse the viral and host membranes, allowing coronaviruses to penetrate cell membranes (10, 19) the monoclonal antibody, Mermab1, targets the MERS-CoV RBD and blocks MERS-CoV entry into host cells. we characterize the neutralizing potency of, RBD-binding specificity of, and epitopes recognized by Mersmab1. female BALB/c mice aged 6 to 8 weeks were used for MAb production. human DPP4 ectodomain with a C-terminal His6 tag (DPP4-His6) was expressed in insect cells using a Bac-to-Bac system. the protein was harvested from the cell culture supernatants and purified sequentially on a Ni-NTA column and a Superdex200 size exclusion column. 293T cells were cotransfected with a plasmid encoding Env-defective and luciferase-expressing HIV-1 genome (pNL4-3.luc.RE) and a plasmid expressing MERS-CoV spike protein. the produced pseudovirus particles were harvested 72 h posttransfection from the cell culture supernatant. after another 72 h, the cells were lysed with cell lysis buffer. an anti-SARS-CoV RBD MAb was used as a control (27) for the neutralizing assay using Calu-3 cells, the mixture of Mersmab1 and virus was incubated with Calu-3 cells at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. the efficacy of Mersmab1 in attenuating MERS-CoV-induced CPE was observed with an inverted microscope (Olympus 1X51) Mersmab1 inhibited the binding between MERS-CoV RBD and cell surface DPP4 (22). Briefly, DPP4-expressing Huh-7 cells were incubated with MERS-CoV RBD-Fc (0.5 g/ml) in the presence or absence of Mersmab1 at various concentrations at room temperature for 30 min. ELISA plates were coated with recombinant spike protein fragments (1 g/ml) at 4\u00b0C overnight and then treated with dithiothreitol (dTT) (10 mM; Sigma) at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. followed by the addition of iodoacetamide (50 mM; Sigma) at 37\u00b0C for 1 h to stop reaction. -nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) Superflow (Qiagen, CA) was expressed in insect cells using a Bac-to-Bac system. the protein was harvested from the cell culture supernatants and purified sequentially on a Ni-NTA column. entry of MERS-CoV spike-mediated pseudoviruses into target cells was inhibited by MAbs using a protocol as previously described. 293T cells were cotransfected with a plasmid encoding Env-defective and luciferase-expressing HIV-1 genome (pNL4-3.luc.RE) the produced pseudovirus particles were harvested 72 h posttransfection from the cell culture supernatant. the inhibitory capacity of each of the MAbs was assessed by determining the presence or absence of virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) the 50% neutralization dose (ND50) was defined as the concentration of the MAb that completely inhibited virus-induced CPE in at least 50% of the wells. MERS-CoV RBD-Fc (residues 377 to 588 containing a C-terminal Fc tag) was mixed with recombinant DPP4 in the presence of Mersmab1-Fab. the remaining AlphaScreen assay was carried out as described above. the substrate 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) was added. the reaction continued for 10 min and was stopped by adding 25 l of 1N H2SO4. the ELISA signal was measured using an ELISA plate reader (Tecan) Mersmab1 showed the most potent anti-MERS-CoV activities. a control, an anti-SARS-CoV RBD MAb, 33G4, did not exhibit any anti-MERS-CoV activities. anti-MERS-CoV MAbs were tested for their neutralizing activity against infection by authentic MERS-CoV (EMC strain) in vero E6 cells. the data are presented as mean percentages of inhibition standard deviations (SD) say was performed by incubating MERS-CoV RBD-Fc with Huh-7 cells in the presence of Mersmab1. the binding between MERS-CoV RBD and DPP4-expressing Huh-7 cells was blocked by Mersmab1. the anti-SARS-CoV MAb 33G4 was unable to inhibit the binding between MERS-CoV RBD and its receptor, DPP4. Flow cytometry assay shows that Mersmab1 inhibits the binding between MERS-CoV RBD and DPP4 in a dose-dependent fashion. the data in panels A and C are presented as means SD (n = 4) and those in panel C as percentages of inhibition. ELISA demonstrated that Mersmab1 specifically bound to MERS-CoV RBD but not to SARS-CoV RBD. Mersmab1 recognizes MERS-CoV spike protein RBD in a conformation-dependent manner. ELISA was carried out to detect the binding between Mersmab1 and MERS-CoV spike protein fragments in the presence or absence of DTT. an anti-Fc MAb (Sigma) was used as the control. the previously determined crystal structure of MERS-CoV RBD in complex with DPP4 (11, 12), we mutated a number of RBD key residues to alanines and then measured how each of these mutations affected the binding of Mersmab1. all of these RBD residues directly contact DPP4; they are L506, D510, R511, E513, D539, W553, and V555. these results suggest that the R511A mutation decreases the binding affinities of the RBD for DPP4 slightly and for Mersmab1 significantly. the mutation in the MERS-CoV spike protein slightly reduced the inhibitory effect of Mersmab1 on MERS-CoV spike-mediated pseudovirus entry. the neutralization mechanism of Mersmab1 is based on the competitive blocking of MERS-CoV RBD binding to DPP4. these recognizing epitopes appear to differ from the recognizing epitopes of anti-SARS-CoV RBD MAbs. recognizing epitopes of all three anti-SARS-CoV MAbs overlap the ACE2-binding region in SARS-CoV RBD. cyan complexed with anti-SARS-CoV MAb m396 Fab (PDB accession no. 2DD8) light chain and heavy chain of the MAb are in yellow and green respectively. Mersmab1 demonstrated the most potent anti-MERS-CoV activities. a control, an anti-SARS-CoV RBD MAb, 33G4, did not exhibit any anti-MERS-CoV activities. anti-MERS-CoV MAbs were tested for their neutralizing activity against infection by authentic MERS-CoV in vero E6 cells. the data are presented as mean percentages of inhibition standard deviations (SD) the binding between MERS-CoV RBD and DPP4-expressing Huh-7 cells was blocked by Mersmab1. the anti-SARS-CoV MAb 33G4 was unable to inhibit the binding between MERS-CoV RBD and its receptor, DPP4. these results suggest that Mersmab1 neutralizes MERS-CoV entry into host cells by blocking the binding of MERS-CoV RBD to its host receptor, DPP4. the data in panels A and C are presented as means SD (n = 4) and those in panel C as percentages of inhibition. ELISA demonstrated that Mersmab1 specifically bound to MERS-CoV RBD but not to SARS-CoV RBD. anti-SARS-CoV MAb 33G4 bound only to SARS-CoV RBD. Mersmab1 recognizes MERS-CoV spike protein RBD in a conformation-dependent manner. ELISA was carried out to detect the binding between Mersmab1 and MERS-CoV spike protein fragments (containing human IgG Fc) we mutated a number of RBD key residues to alanines and then measured how each of these mutations affected the binding of Mersmab1. all of these RBD residues directly contact DPP4; they are L506, D510, R511, E513, D539, W553, and V555. the R511A mutation decreases the binding affinities of the RBD for DPP4 slightly and for Mersmab1 significantly. we mapped the recognizing epitopes of Mersmab1 on the determined structural model of MERS-CoV RBD. the neutralization mechanism of Mersmab1 is based on the competitive blocking of MERS-CoV RBD binding to DPP4. recognizing epitopes of all three anti-SARS-CoV RBD MAbs overlap the ACE2-binding region in SARS-CoV RBD. recognizing epitopes of anti-MERS-CoV and anti-SARS-CoV MAbs provide a structural basis for studying the antigenicity of different corona the light chain and heavy chain of the MAb are in yellow and green respectively. the newly emerged MERS-CoV poses a continuing threat to human health. the high fatality rate (over 40%) associated with MERS-CoV infections is particularly worrying. the neutralizing epitopes recognized by Mersmab1 are located on one edge of the DPP4-binding surface in MERS-CoV RBD. the overlap between these neutralizing epitopes and the DPP4-binding region explains the mechanism by which Mersmab1 potently neutralizes MERS-CoV infection."}
