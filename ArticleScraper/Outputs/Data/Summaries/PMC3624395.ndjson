{"summary": "bunyaviruses are enveloped viruses with a tripartite, single-stranded RNA genome. genus Hantavirus infects rodents, their natural reservoir, and are transmitted to humans via feces and urine. zoonotic transmission of bunyaviruses to humans can be associated with severe disease. cytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is associated with infection by a new phlebovirus, SFTS virus (SFTSV) (6). phylogenetic analysis revealed that SFTSV is equally distant from the sandfly fever and the uukuniemi groups of phleboviruses. pathogenic hantaviruses employ 3 integrins as receptors (19, 20) and decay-accelerating factor (DAF) as a coreceptor for host cell entry (21), while nonpathogenic viruses seem to have different receptor requirements. rhabdoviral vector system suitable for safe and efficient analysis of SFTSV entry into host cells. suspension cells were maintained in modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) suspension cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (PAA) supplemented with 5 to 10% fetal calf serum (Biochrom or HyClone) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin sulfate. at least 95% of the cells were positive for DC-SIGN (CD209). all cells were grown in a humidified atmosphere at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. consensus sequence is identical to NCBI GenBank accession number ADZ04482.1. plasmid p96ZM651gag-opt, encoding human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Gag, was employed. plasmid p96ZM651gag-opt, encoding human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Gag, was removed. a monoclonal antibody directed against the VSV M protein was obtained from Kerafast. supernatants were harvested, passed through 0.45-m-pore-size filters, aliquoted, and stored at 80\u00b0C. rhabdoviral pseudotypes were normalized for infectivity by infection of U373 or Vero cells with different dilutions of virus. luciferase activity in cell lysates was determined using a commercially available kit (Promega) adherent cell lines were seeded and differentiated into either macrophages or dendritic cells in 96-well plates at a density of 7.5 104 cells/well. the cells were infected with 50 l of infectivity-normalized pseudotyped virus. luciferase activity in cell lysates was measured at 24 h postinfection. dynasore, wortmannin, wortmannin, CA074, CA074Me, CatL III, and AEBSF were diluted in solvent as recommended by the manufacturer. target cells were pretreated with the inhibitors for 30 to 60 min at 37\u00b0C and infected with infectivity-normalized pseudotypes in presence of inhibitor. adherent cells were cultivated in monocyte adherence medium for 24 h. each other, the culture medium was changed. at least 95% of the cells were positive for DC-SIGN (CD209) consensus sequence represents the most frequent SFTSV sequences found in patients. consensus sequence is identical to NCBI GenBank accession number ADZ04482.1. plasmid p96ZM651gag-opt was encoding human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Gag. the DC-SIGN/R-specific antibody 526 was described previously (28). lentiviral pseudotypes were generated as described previously (26). infection was carried out at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.5. targets cells were incubated with vector for 60 min at 37\u00b0C. cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with neutralizing polyclonal serum directed against VSV G. rhabdoviral pseudotypes were collected from the culture supernatant. 100 TCID50 of pseudotyped virus was incubated with different dilutions of positive serum samples (A, B, C, and D) in duplicate for 1 h at 37\u00b0C in a total volume of 150 l of growth medium in 96-well flat-bottom culture plates. freshly trypsinized 293T cells (104 cells in 50 l of growth medium) were added to each well. transfection of plasmid into 293T cells allowed robust expression of the SFTSV glycoprotein Gc. 58-kDa band corresponds to predicted size of Gc. expression of the SFTSV glycoprotein in human cells is efficient. cleavage site is indicated by an arrow, and consensus signals for N-linked glycosylation are indicated by triangles. incorporation of SFTSV Gc into virus-like particles was analyzed by expression of pCAGGS SFTSV Gn/Gc V5 or empty plasmid in combination with p96ZM651gag-opt encoding human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Gag (p55), followed by Western blotting of particles the infection of cells with particles bearing no glycoproteins resulted in luciferase activities close to background. all target cells tested were efficiently infected with particles pseudotyped with VSV G, as expected. infection of human monocyte-derived macrophages was inefficient. n/Gc in 293T cells followed by transduction with a VSVG-GFP/luc virus. infectivity was determined by luciferase assay. the results of representative experiments performed in triplicate are shown. cellular entry mediated by the glycoproteins of SFTSV is pH dependent. entry driven by the viral glycoproteins of SFTSV depends on low pH. lysosomotropic agents elevate the low endosomal pH. entry driven by the viral glycoproteins depends on low pH. infectious entry of Ebola virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus requires low pH (26, 40, 41) pH dependence is not due to protons triggering the membrane fusion activity of the viral glycoproteins. acidic pH is indispensable for the activity of cathepsins B and L. cleavage is a prerequisite for membrane fusion. the cells were infected with pseudotypes bearing glycoproteins of VSV, Zaire EBOV, SFTSV, or LACV as indicated, normalized for comparable infectivity. the averages of four (three for LACV Gn/Gc) experiments are shown; the error bars indicate standard errors of the mean. wortmannin treatment markedly inhibited entry of EBOV GP-bearing pseudotypes. clathrin-mediated endocytosis is required for efficient cellular entry of pseudotypes bearing the glycoproteins of SFTSV. sera from convalescent patients inhibited viral spread. sera from convalescent SFTS patients neutralize infectivity of SFTSV glycoprotein-bearing pseudotypes. a single serum dilution (1:10) was tested. similar results were obtained in an independent experiment. entry mediated by RVFV and LACV Gn/Gc was examined in parallel. the Raji cell lines analyzed were highly susceptible to VSV G-driven entry. entry efficiency was not modulated by lectin expression. DC-SIGN can serve as a host cell receptor for entry mediated by the glycoproteins of SFTSV. parental Raji B cells were infected with pseudotypes bearing the glycoproteins of VSV, SFTSV, LACV, or RVFV. the results are representative of three independent experiments using two different donors and three independent pseudotype preparations. the SFTSV glycoprotein Gc is efficiently expressed in 293T cells and incorporated into a heterologous viral envelope. transfection of the plasmid into 293T cells allowed robust expression of the SFTSV glycoprotein Gc. pCAGGS plasmid or pCAGGS encoding SFTSV Gn/Gc with a V5 antigenic tag. at 48 h posttransfection, cell lysates were prepared and analyzed for SFTSV Gn/Gc expression by Western blotting. the signal peptide (striped) and the transmembrane domain (black) are shown. cell tropism of SFTSV Gn/Gc-bearing pseudotypes was compared with that of pseudotypes harboring LACV and RVFV Gn/Gc. the G protein of VSV served as a positive control, and particles without glycoproteins were used as negative controls. infection of cells with particles bearing no glycoproteins resulted in luciferase activities close to background. VSV-derived vectors are suitable to analyze SFTSV Gn/Gc-driven host cell entry. rhabdoviral pseudotypes were generated by expression of VSV G or SFTSV, LACV, or RVFV Gn/Gc in 293T cells followed by transduction with a VSVG-GFP/luc virus. differences in cell tropism of SFTSV, LACV, and RVFV Gn/Gc-bearing pseudotypes also became apparent with animal cells. in sum, the Gn/Gc proteins of SFTSV can mediate entry into diverse cell lines of human and animal origin. infectivity was determined by luciferase activity in cell extracts. activity of a cellular serine protease is required for host cell entry driven by the glycoproteins of SFTSV and LACV. acidic pH is indispensable for the activity of cathepsins B and L, endosomal proteases that cleave the viral glycoproteins. observations were made with the human cell lines U373 and RPE (not shown) suggesting that a so-far-uncharacterized cellular serine protease activity might be required for infectious entry of SFTSV, LACV, and potentially other bunyaviruses. the cells were infected with pseudotypes bearing glycoproteins of VSV, Zaire EBOV, SFTSV, or LACV as indicated. EBOV GP were both inhibited by dynasore, according to previous reports. entry by SFTSV and LACV Gn/Gc was also blocked in a dose-dependent fashion. clathrin-mediated endocytosis is required for efficient cellular entry. sera from convalescent SFTS patients inhibited viral spread. luciferase activity was determined in cell extracts. error bars indicate SD. a single serum dilution (1:10) was obtained in an independent experiment. the glycoproteins of SFTSV can use the lectin DC-SIGN as a receptor for host cell entry. cells involved in pathogen recognition and cell-cell adhesion can be hijacked by viruses for entry into host cells. dendritic cells express high levels of endogenous DC-SIGN (54) and are susceptible to SFTSV Gn/Gc-mediated infection. inhibition of DC-SIGN by antibody 526 and mannan had no effect on VSV G-driven entry but markedly reduced infection mediated by SFTSV Gn/Gc. infection of dendritic cells in the absence of inhibitor was set as 100%. results are representative of three independent experiments using two different donors and three independent pseudotype preparations. DISCUSSION Emerging bunyaviruses endanger animal and human health. SFTSV Gn/Gc can use DC-SIGN as a receptor or entry factor for host cell infection. we used a VSV-based pseudotyping system to analyze host cell entry. supernatants from cells producing VSV-based pseudotypes generally showed higher infectivity than supernatants obtained from cells generating lentiviral pseudotypes. the presence of both proteins is required for efficient bunyavirus entry. we found that cell lines derived from different human organs are susceptible to SFTSV Gn/Gc-driven infection. these results suggest that the SFTSV receptor(s) is broadly expressed and that the virus might be capable of multiorgan spread. lysosomotropic agents block cellular entry driven by SFTSV Gn/Gc in a dose-dependent manner. inhibition stems from the blockade of the pH-dependent lysosomal cysteine proteases cathepsins B and L, which prime the viral glycoproteins for fusion. however, entry mediated by both SFTSV and LACV Gn/Gc proteins was markedly inhibited by the serine protease inhibitor A infected cells and in the endocytic pathway of uninfected target cells is mediated by different proteases. the processing of SFTSV Gn/Gc by an AEBSF-sensitive protease during entry into host cells remains to be demonstrated biochemically. however, the potential \u201cdouble processing\u201d of viral glycoproteins in infected and target cells is not without precedent. integrin usage and pathogenicity has been proposed (19\u201321, 65) phleboviruses can use the C-type lectin DC-SIGN for uptake into host cell endosomes. expression of DC-SIGN allowed SFTSV, RVFV, and LACV Gn/Gc-driven infection of DC-SIGN-expressing Raji B cells, which were otherwise nonsusceptible to infection."}
