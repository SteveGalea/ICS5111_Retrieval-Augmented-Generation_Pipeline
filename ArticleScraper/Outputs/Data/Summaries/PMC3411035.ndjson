{"summary": "conventional proteins are synthesized on the ribosome as topologically linear chains of amino acids that typically fold into complex three-dimensional shapes. circular proteins differ from linear proteins in that their backbones have one additional peptide bond that joins the N and C termini to make a topologically circular backbone. the most significant advantage is enhanced stability, including stability against unfolding at high temperatures, in presence of chemical chaotropes. we use the term circular proteins to emphasize their topology and proteinaceous nature, even though many are not much larger than cyclosporin. in the first minireview, G\u00f6ransson and colleagues focus on bacterial circular proteins, including pilins, bacteriocins, and cyanobactins. circular proteins have a range of potential applications. bacteriocins are highly toxic to bacteria other than the producing strain. some are used as food preservatives, others show potential in the medical or veterinary treatment of bacterial infections. cyclic peptide toxins have an LD50 of 0.1 mg/kg, so a single mushroom can kill a human. a single bite of such a mushroom is likely to be sufficient to deter natural herbivores. the key difference between the different classes of circular proteins is the absence of disulfide bonds in bacterial cyclic proteins. a thiol side chain at the N terminus of a peptide chain is the key element in the approach described by Tam and Wong. this approach is particularly effective for disulfide-rich peptides where the reaction is effectively accelerated by the presence of multiple intermediate cysteine thiols in a \u201cthia-zip\u201d process. recent advances in the ability to synthesize cyclic peptides will provide many opportunities to develop novel peptide-based therapeutic and diagnostic reagents."}
