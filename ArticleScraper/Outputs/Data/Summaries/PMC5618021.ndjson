{"summary": "the world health organization (WHO) has been notified of 2037 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV and at least 710 deaths related to MERS-CoV. since September 2012, 27 countries have reported cases of MERS-CoV globally while most cases were found in Saudi Arabia [8,9] three heptad repeat 1 (HR1)segments and three heptad repeat 2 (HR2) segments form a six-helix bundle (MERS-6HB) fusion core. this strong interaction of HR1s and HR2s brings the viral and cell membrane close to each other. this strong interaction of HR1s and HR2s brings the viral and cell membrane close to each other which triggers fusion. the gene of MERS-5HB was synthesized as a codon of HR1\u2013SGGRGG\u2013HR2\u2013GGSGGSGG\u2013HR2\u2013GGSGGSGG\u2013HR1 for expression in the Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3). the bacteria were grown at 37 \u00b0C in 2 to an optical density (OD600) of 0.8 and induced with 1 mM isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at the sequence of synthesized MERS-HR2P is Biotin-GGGSLTQINTTLLDLTYEMLSLQQVVKALNESYIDLKEL. an irrelevant peptide HIV-HR2P derived from HR2 in gp41 was used as control. ERS-HR2P and HIV-HR2P were added and incubated for 1 h. initial concentration was 1 M and the subsequent was diluted by a 5-fold gradient. absorption was recorded at 405 nm by a Synergy 2 Multi-Mode Reader. plasmid pNL4-3.luc.RE was cloned with 125 ng/well of the plasmid pcDNA3.1-MERS-S. pseudovirus culture was replaced with 100 L/well fresh medium for 72 h incubation. 100 TCID50 of MERS-CoV pseudovirus was pre-incubated with serially diluted MERS-5HB in quadruplicate from the highest concentration of 15 M at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. the virus\u2013protein mixture was then transferred to a 96-well white opaque plate seeded with Huh-7 cells (1 104/well) the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudovirus was prepared as a control. 293T cells (293T/MERS-S) and enhanced green fluorescent protein expression plasmid pEGFP-C3 (500 ng/well) were transfected to Huh-7 cells (Huh-7/EGFP) in a 24-well plate. six hours later, freshly trypsinized cells of Huh-7/EGFP and 293T/MERS-S were mixed at ratios of 1:1, 3:1, and 9:1. spectra from 190 nm to 260 nm were recorded on an Applied Photophysics spectrophotometer at 25 \u00b0C in a 0.1 cm path length cuvette. the spectra was recorded at 222 nm in temperatures ranging from 25 \u00b0C to 95 \u00b0C at a ramp-rate of 1 \u00b0C/min for evaluation of the thermodynamic stability. the bacteria were grown at 37 \u00b0C in 2 to an optical density (OD600) of 0.8. the cells were harvested and re-suspended in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) containing 500 mM NaCl. the supernatant was passed over a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column pre-equilibrated with PBS containing 500 mM NaCl. Binding of MERS-5HB to Immobilized Peptide A 96-well half-area plate coated with 100 ng/well (50 L) of Streptavidin. biotin-labeled MERS-HR2P and HIV-HR2P were pipetted into each well for 1 h of incubation at 37 \u00b0C. biotin-labeled MERS-HR2P and HIV-HR2P (100 ng/well) were pipetted into each well for 1 h of incubation at 37 \u00b0C. the absorbance was read at 405 nm with a Synergy 2 Multi-Mode Reader. biotin-labeled 500 ng/mL MERS-HR2P was loaded into streptavidin biosensors. then MERS-5HB was added at a series of concentrations. association and dissociation time were both set as 1200 s. 50 L/well pseudovirus was mixed with 50 L/well culture medium in quadruplicate in a 96-well white opaque plate. the plate was incubated at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO2 air environment for 12 h. then pseudovirus culture was replaced with 100 L/well fresh medium. vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudovirus was prepared as a control. inhibition of MERS-CoV pseudovirus was presented as percent inhibition. the 293T cells transfected with vector pcDNA3.1 were used as a negative control. the co-cultured cells were seeded in a 24-well plate, in absence or presence of MERS-5HB. after 48 h, the obvious syncytial formation was observed and photographed in light as well as a fluorescence field. thermo-induced unfolding measured by recording the spectra at 222 nm in temperatures ranging from 25 \u00b0C to 95 \u00b0C at a ramp-rate of 1 \u00b0C/min. the CD data were shown as mean residue ellipticity. MERS-5HB contains three copies of HR1 (residues 984 to 1062) and two copies of HR2 (residues 1245 to 1289) the predicted structure of MERS-5HB was similar to MERS-6HB although lacking one HR2. MERS-5HB contains three HR1 segments and two HR2 segments. the linker of HR1 to HR2 is SGGRGG and the linker of HR2 to HR1 is GGSGGSGG. as a solved crystal structure, the six-helix bundle contains three HR1 segments (shown in blue) and three HR2 segments (shown in cyan) which pack into the HR1 side grooves. interaction kinetics result showed that the KD value was 2.4 1010 M, the association rate constant was 5.26 104 1.41 102 M1 s1 and the dissociation rate constant was 1.26 105 7.78 107 s1. interaction between MERS-5HB and MERS-HR2P is strong and specific, which could make it possible for MERS-5HB to inhibit virus entry. MERS-5HB showed a notable inhibitory effect for the MERS-CoV pseudovirus but not for the VSV pseudovirus, even at the highest concentration (15 M), demonstrating the inhibitory specificity of MERS-5HB. no significant cytotoxicity to cell-growth was observed of MERS-5HB at the concentration up to 50 M. line 293T cells can instantaneously express MERS-CoV S protein (293T/MERS-S) were co-cultured with Huh-7 cells expressing EGFP (Huh-7/EGFP) as a reporter, using 293T cells with a transfected vector as the control (293T/vector) forty-eight hours later, effective cell\u2013cell fusion was observed. the inhibition effect was dependent on the concentration of MERS-5HB. the estimated 50% inhibition occurred at a concentration of 0.56 M. because MERS-5HB could effectively bind to the MERS-HR2P representative of viral HR2. HB at 1 mg/mL in PBS exhibited double negative peaks at 208 nm and 222 nm. as the temperature increased, the structure was slightly destroyed. this helical bundle showed strong thermal stability and appeared to be folded very well. heptad repeat 1 (HR1) (residues 984 to 1062) and heptad repeat 2 (HR2) (residues 1245 to 1289) are from the major parts of HR1 and HR2 domains in the S2 subunit. MERS-5HB contains three HR1 segments and two HR2 segments. the linker of HR1 to HR2 is SGGRGG and the linker of HR2 to HR1 is GGSGGS biolayer interferometry was conducted to determine binding affinity of MERS-5HB to MERS-5HB. interactions with MERS-5HB at six different concentrations were monitored. interaction kinetics result showed that the KD value was 2.4 1010 M, the association rate constant was 5.26 104 1.41 102 M1 s1, and the dissociation rate constant was 1.26 105 7.78 107 s1. MERS-5HB showed a notable inhibitory effect for the MERS-CoV pseudovirus but not for the VSV pseudovirus. the inhibitory effect was tested in cultured Huh-7 cells. syncytium formation was reduced when 293T/MERS-S cells decreased at the ratios of 1:1, 3:1, 9:1 and 293T/vector cells were tested as control. syncytium formation was reduced when 293T/MERS-S cells decreased. the highest concentration was 5 M, followed with three-times dilution. the inhibition effect was dependent on the concentration of MERS-5HB. the estimated 50% inhibition occurred at a concentration of 0.56 M. thermo-induced unfolding of MERS-5HB was monitored at 222 nm in temperatures ranging from 25 \u00b0C to 95 \u00b0C. as temperature increased, the structure was slightly destroyed but with no obvious S-shaped curve appearing. thermo-induced unfolding of MERS-5HB was monitored at 222 nm in temperatures ranging from 25 \u00b0C to 95 \u00b0C. as the temperature increased, the structure was slightly destroyed but with no obvious S-shaped curve appearing. this helical bundle showed strong thermal stability and appeared to be folded very well. MERS-5HB, lacking one HR2, could bind to native HR2. inhibition activity is similar to previously reported short peptide inhibitors.
