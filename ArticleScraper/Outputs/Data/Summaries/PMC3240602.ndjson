{"summary": "tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) is model plant RNA virus coding for two replication proteins, p33 and p92pol, which are sufficient to support TBSV replicon (rep)RNA replication in a yeast. p33 and p92pol are components of the membrane-bound viral replicase complex, which also contains the tombusviral repRNA serving not only as a template for replication, but also as a platform for the assembly of the viral replicase eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1A plays several roles during TBSV replication. eEF1A has been shown to facilitate the assembly of the viral replicase complex. eEF1B is an abundant, but not essential cellular protein. eEF1B plays a role by enhancing minus-strand synthesis by the viral replicase. the obtained data support the model that eEF1B opens up a \u2018closed\u2019 structure at the 3\u2032-end of the TBSV (+)RNA. EF4 yeast genes coding for eEF1B on TBSV repRNA accumulation in yeast and in a cell-free extract. TBSV replicase assay supports a role for eEF1B in minusstrand synthesis. in the nondenatured samples, the dsRNA product represents the annealed (-)RNA and the input (+)RNA, while the ssRNA products represents the newly made (+)RNA products. eEF1B stimulates TBSV repRNA synthesis in whole cell extract prepared from tef4. assay uncouples translation of viral proteins from viral replication. tef4 yeast supported only 29% of TBSV repRNA replication compared with wt yeast extract. dsRNA and ssRNA both decreased by 3-fold in CFE. eEF1B stimulates initiation of (-)RNA synthesis by a viral RdRp in vitro. the recombinant TCV RdRp preparation lacks co-purified eEF1B. the recombinant TCV RdRp preparation does not have a homolog. eEF1B in the absence of the TCV RdRp did not give a 32P-labeled RNA product, excluding that our eEF1B preparation contained RdRp activity. eEF1B promotes minus-strand synthesis by the closely-related TCV RdRp. eEF1B (20 pmol), eEF1B (20 pmol) and purified TCV RdRp (2 pmol) were used in these assays. one template was SL3-2-1 m(+) with a point mutation within the promoter sequence. the second template was RI-III(-) representing portions of the minus-stranded RNA. the mutation opens up the closed structure in the promoter region that leads to increased template activity. eEF1B did not stimulate RNA products when the negative-stranded RI-III(-) RNA was used as a template in the TCV RdRp assay. eEF1B binds to the 3\u2032 end of the TBSV (+)RNA. eEF1B - 32P-labeled free ssDNA and ssDNA/ssRNA duplex were separated on nondenaturing acrylamide gels. eEF1B is known to bind to A-rich single-stranded sequences [32], we mutagenized the tetraloop sequence to either CUUG or GUUU tetraloop sequences. eEF1B binding may be dependent on stabilizing effects of the GNRA tetraloop on the stem structure. eEF1B stimulates the RdRp activity of a viral polymerase on a TBSV template in vitro. mutated nucleotides are encircled, while the SL2 hairpin is not shown. each experiment was repeated three times. eEF1B co-purifies with the viral replicase complex and it binds to TBSV repRNA in yeast. eEF1B does not seem to bind to p33 or p92 replication proteins. eEF1B is likely to be co-purified with p33 via the viral RNA template. the purified HF-p33 and the co-purified His6-tagged eEF1B were detected with anti-His antibody. both the membrane and soluble yeast fractions were used for eEF1B purification and subsequent RT-PCR analysis. eEF1B did not facilitate the association of the TBSV (+)repRNA with the membrane when applied in the absence of p33/p92 replication proteins. eEF1B did not further increase the amount of TBSV (+)repRNA bound to the membrane in the presence of p33/p92 replication proteins. we found the largest stimulation of (-)-strand synthesis by the viral RdRp in a dual pre-incubation assay. pre-incubation of eEF1B with the viral RNA template (lanes 5\u20136) or pre-incubation of eEF1A with the viral RdRp (lanes 7\u20138) were half as efficient in stimulation of (-)-strand synthesis than the dual pre-incubation assay (lanes 3\u20134). eEF1B is essential for TBSV genomic RNA accumulation in N. benthamiana plants. eEF1B knockdown inhibits TBSV RNA replication in the natural plant hosts. eEF1B knockdown N. benthamiana plants 3 days post-inoculation. reduced accumulation of TBSV RNA in the systemically-infected leaves of eEF1B knockdown. deletion of eEF1B inhibits TBSV RNA accumulation in yeast model host eEF1B is coded by TEF3 and TEF4 nonessential genes in yeast. expression of eEF1B (Tef4p) in tef4 yeast increased TBSV replication to 80%. ef4 yeast with plasmid-based Tef4p (eEF1B) stimulates TBSV repRNA synthesis in whole cell extract prepared from tef4. purified recombinant p33 (12 pmol) and p92pol (1 pmol) replication proteins in combination with DI-72 (+)repRNA (4 pmol) were added to whole cell extract prepared from tef4 (lanes 1\u20132) or WT yeast strains esized 32P-labeled TBSV repRNA was measured on denaturing PAGE. the eEF1B added to the tef4 CFE is about 10-fold less than the total eEF1B present in the WT CFE. dsRNA and ssRNA both decreased by 3-fold in CFE obtained from tef4 yeast in comparison with those in the wt CFE (lane 3) the obtained data are consistent with the model that Tef4p (eEF1B) affects the level of (-)RNA production, which then leads to proportionately lower level of (+)RNA progeny. the recombinant TCV RdRp preparation lacks co-purified eEF1B. eEF1B in the absence of the TCV RdRp did not give a 32P-labeled RNA product. eEF1B in the absence of the TCV RdRp did not give a 32P-labeled RNA product. 1B promotes minus-strand synthesis by the closely-related TCV RdRp. the TBSV (+)RNA template was the short 3\u2032 end region [SL3-2-1(+), 20 pmol], which contain the promoter region (SL1) for initiation and the replication silencer element (within SL3) that down-regulates initiation. on the in vitro RdRp activity was due to binding of eEF1B to the (+)RNA template and/or to the TCV RdRp protein, we performed assays. pre-incubation of the purified eEF1B with the TBSV-derived SL3-2-1(+) RNA template led to a 4.5-fold increase in (-)RNA products. eEF1B binds to the 3\u2032 end of the TBSV RNA in vitro. eEF1B can stimulate (-)-strand synthesis by the RdRp on the wt 3\u2032 TBSV. eEF1B - 32P-labeled ssRNA complex was visualized on nondenaturing 5% acrylamide gels. eEF1B - 32P-labeled ssRNA complex was visualized on nondenaturing gels. tetraloop region of SL1 is an efficient binding site for eEF1B in vitro. the loop nucleotides may or may not be involved in protein-RNA contacts. binding of eEF1B to the 3\u2032 end of the TBSV RNA is required for stimulation of (-)-strand RNA synthesis. eEF1Bstimulates the RdRp activity of a viral polymerase in vitro. each experiment was repeated three times. eEF1B co-purifies with the viral replicase complex. the tombusvirus replicase purified the his6-tagged p33 (HF-p33) replication protein via flag-affinity purification from the membrane fraction of yeast. both the membrane and soluble yeast fractions were used for eEF1B purification and subsequent purification. eEF1B was expressed from a plasmid or not in yeast. we flag-affinity-purified his6-tagged eEF1B from the membrane fraction. eEF1B binds to the viral RNA in yeast. eEF1B and eEF1A bind to the 3\u2032-terminal region of the TBSV. it is possible that they could affect each other's functions during replication. eEF1B was known to stimulate (-)-strand synthesis the most when pre-incubated with the template RNA. eEF1B and eEF1A promote (-)-strand synthesis by the closely-related TCV RdRp assay. purified eEF1B (20 pmol) and eEF1A (20 pmol) were added to the TCV RdRp (2 pmol) assay. the lethal necrotic symptoms caused by TBSV in N. benthamiana were greatly attenuated in the eEF1B knock-down plants. eEF1B is essential for TBSV genomic RNA accumulation in N. bethamiana. we found that the severe symptoms caused by TMV were greatly ameliorated in eEF1B knock-down plants. Accumulation of TMV genomic RNA was also dramatically reduced in both inoculated (Figure 8B) and systemically-infected (Figure 8C) leaves of eEF1B knock-down plants. eEF1B is a permanent member of the tombusvirus replicase complex. eEF1B is likely recruited into the viral replicase via the viral (+)RNA. eEF1B is bound to eEF1B in both cytosolic and membranous fractions. eEF1B stimulates (-)-strand synthesis by binding to the viral (+)RNA template. pre-incubation of eEF1B and the TBSV-derived template RNA led to the highest level of stimulation of (-)RNA synthesis in vitro. gPR region is present in a \u2018closed\u2019 structure in the TBSV (+)RNA due to base-pairing of a portion of the gPR. eEF1B can bind to the tetraloop region of SL1 (and to an A-rich sequence in SL2) that leads to melting of the base-paired structure and opening the stem of SL1 and the RSE-gPR base-pairing. eEF1B stimulated (-)-strand synthesis on a (-)-strand template by the viral RdRp. eEF1B can melt only the local secondary structure, but cannot unwind more extended duplex regions. eEF1B protein stabilizes the unpaired structure, rather than implying that it actively \"opens\" the structure. arrow indicates middle-range RNA base-pairing that leads to a closed structure. new (+)-strand RNA progeny will not enter the replication cycle in absence of bound eEF1B within the original replicase complexes. this model suggests that eEF1B plays a key role in regulation of the use of (+)-strand RNAs in TBSV replication. many (+)-strand RNA viruses recruit translation elongation factors to facilitate and regulate replication in infected cells. eEF1B and eEF1A bind to p92pol RdRp and SL3 region of TBSV. binding of eEF1A-RdRp complex to the RSE may lead to proper positioning of the RdRp over the 3\u2032-terminal gPR promoter sequence opened up by eEF1B. eEF1B is required for TBSV replication in yeast and plant hosts. eEF1B is a highly conserved protein in all eukaryotes. deletion of either TEF3 or TEF4 genes reduced TBSV repRNA accumulation in yeast. eEF1B selectively enhances minus-strand synthesis by opening the \u2018closed\u2019 3\u2032-end of the template RNA. eEF1B selectively enhances minus-strand synthesis by opening the \u2018closed\u2019 3\u2032-end of the template RNA. eEF1B selectively enhances minus-strand synthesis by opening the \u2018closed\u2019 3\u2032-end of the template RNA. in vitro initiation of (-)-strand synthesis by the viral RdRp requires the gPR promoter consisting of a short 3\u2032-terminal single-stranded tail and a stem-loop (SL1) sequence. the gPR region is present in a \u2018closed\u2019 structure in the TBSV (+)RNA due to base-pairing of a portion of the gPR with the RSE present in SL3. eEF1B stimulated (-)-strand synthesis on a (-)-strand template by the viral RdRp. eEF1B could not efficiently bind to the 3\u2032-end of the TBSV RNA. eEF1B protein stabilizes the unpaired structure, rather than imply it actively \"opens\" the structure. displacement of eEF1B from the (+)RNA during RNA synthesis decreases the probability of new rounds of initiation by p92pol on the original (+)RNA templates. this could prevent efficient re-utilization of the original (+)-strand template and the switch to efficient (+)-strand synthesis on the (-)RNA intermediate. eEF1B plays a role in vimentin mRNA subcellular localization. eEF1B also binds to the tRNA-like structure at the 3\u2032 UTR of BMV. the actual role of eEF1B in the VSV replicase is currently not defined. eEF1A facilitates the proper and efficient binding of the RdRp to the 3\u2032 terminal gPR promoter sequence. binding of eEF1A-RdRp complex to the viral RNA might lead to proper positioning of the RdRp over the 3\u2032-terminal gPR promoter sequence opened up by eEF1B. more inhibition of TBSV RNA accumulation than deletion of eEF1B genes in yeast. this is likely due to the robust antiviral response (i.e., induced gene silencing) of the plant host. this could result in degradation of the small amount of viral RNA produced by the less efficient viral RNA replication. TKY680 strain in which both yeast encoded eEF1B, TEF4 and TEF3 were deleted. TKY678 (MATa ura3-52 leu21 his3200 trp1101 lys2-801 tef3::LEU2) and TKY 679 (mata ura3-52 leu21 his3200 trp1101 lys2-801 tef4::TRP1) were published earlier plasmid pYES-NTC2-GAL1-HisTef4 expressing his6-tagged Tef4p protein was digested with BamHI and XhoI restriction enzymes. then PCR product of the TEF4 gene was digested with the same restriction enzymes, followed by ligationto obtain pEsc-His/Cup-FLAG-TEF4. ef4), TKY678 (tef3) and wild type TKY677 yeast were transformed with plasmids pESC-GAL1-His33/GAL10-DI-72 and pCM189-TET-His92. Yeast was pre-grown at 23\u00b0C overnight in 3 ml synthetic complete dropout medium lacking relevant amino acids containing 2% glucose. TBSV replication was launched by replacing the media with 2% gal 32P-labeled RNA products were separated by electrophoresis in a 5% polyacrylamide gel (PAGE) containing 0.5x Tris-borate-EDTA (TBE) buffer with 8 M urea. the 32P-labeled RNA samples were divided into two aliquotes. one half was loaded onto the gel without heat treatment in the presence of 25% formamide. the other half was heat denatured at 85\u00b0C for 5 min in the the 86-nt 3\u2032 noncoding region of TBSV genomic RNA and its mutants were used as the template in the RdRp assay [24], [36]. RNA templates were generated with T7 transcription using PCR products amplified with primers #1662 and #1190. a duplex RNA was generated by hybridizing SL3-2-1(+) and SL3-2-ds1(-) made by T7 transcription of the PCR product using primers #4361 strain was co-transformed with pGBK-ADH-Hisp33/GAL1-DI72, pGAD-CUP1-Hisp92 and pESC-CUP1-HisFLAG-Tef4. different concentrations of HF-Tef4p protein were used for incubation with 0.2 pmol of 32P-labeled SL3/2/1(+) RNA or mutated RNAs at 25\u00b0 the transcription of DI-72 RNA was stopped by changing to the media containing 2% glucose after 8 h. the cultures were diluted to 200 ml and copper sulfate was added to a final concentration of 50 M. cells were re-suspended in 2 ml TG Buffer (50 mM Tris\u2013HCl [pH 7.5], 10% glycerol, 15% MgCl2 and 10 mM KCl) the membrane fraction was centrifuged at 35,000 g at 4\u00b0C for 15 min. the supernatant was added to the resin pre-equilibrated with TG buffer. the bound proteins were eluted with 150 l TG buffer without NaCl. yeast cultures were grown in SC-ULH- media containing 1% raffinose and 1% galactose with 5 M copper-sulfate for 4 days. co-purification of 6xHis-tagged Tef4p with HF-p33 (part of the viral replicase) was conducted by using anti-FLAG M2-agarose affinity resin as described above. the sequence of the N. tabacum eEF1B gene (GenBank: ACB72462.1) was derived via a BLASTP search based on the C- terminal domain (aa 252\u2013412) of the Saccharomyces cerevisie Tef4 protein. the selected sequence (TC64920) gave 98% identity with N. tabacum EF1B -like gene (GB#: EU580435.1). 32P-labeled complementary RNA probes were prepared for the 3\u2032-ends of the viral genomic RNAs based on T7 transcription. TBSV viral RNA is recruited to the membrane from the soluble fraction with the help of TBSV replication proteins and host factors present in the yeast CFE. TKY678 (MATa ura3-52 leu21 his3200 trp1101 lys2-801 tef4::LEU2) and TKY 679 (MATa ura3-52 leu21 his3200 trp1101 lys2-801 tef4::TRP1) were published previously. plasmids pESC-GAL1-Hisp33/GAL10-DI-72, plasmid pYES-NTC2-GAL1-HisTef4 expressing his6-tagged Tef4p protein was created with the same restriction enzymes using pYES-NT-C2. pEsc-His/Cup-FLAG plasmid [20] was digested with BamHI and XhoI restriction enzymes and then PCR product of the TEF4 gene was generated with primers #2089 and #2320 Yeast was pre-grown overnight in 2 ml synthetic complete dropout medium lacking histidine (SC-H- medium) containing 2% glucose and 1 mg/ml doxycyclin. cells were harvested at 48 h time point. expression and purification of eEF1B protein pEsc-His/Cup-FLAG-TEF4 plasmid was transformed into tef4 strain. the 32P-labeled RNA samples were divided into two aliquotes. one half was loaded onto the gel without heat treatment in the presence of 25% formamide. the other half was heat denatured at 85\u00b0C for 5 min in the presence of 50% formamide. a duplex RNA was generated by hybridizing SL3-2-1(+) and SL3-2-ds1(-) made by T7 transcription of the PCR product using primers #1662 and #1190. equal amounts of both RNAs were mixed in 1X STE buffer [0.1 M NaCl 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) 1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0)] followed by treatments. mutated RNAs at 25\u00b0C in a binding buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.2), 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM DTT, 10% glycerol, 2 U of RNase inhibitor (Ambion)] samples were incubated at 25\u00b0C for 15 min, then resolved in 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel [23] Similar experiments were also performed with 6xHis-affinity purified recomb cells were re-suspended in 2 ml TG Buffer (50 mM Tris\u2013HCl [pH 7.5], 10% glycerol, 15 mM MgCl2 and 10 mM KCl) the samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 4 min. the solubilized membrane fraction was centrifuged at 35,000 g at 4\u00b0C for 15 min. the supernatant was added to the resin pre-equilibrated with TG buffer. the bound proteins were eluted with 150 l TG buffer without NaCl. cDNA fragment of eEF1B was RT-PCR amplified from a total RNA extract of N. benthamiana. the sequence of the N. tabacum eEF1B gene (GenBank: ACB72462.1) was derived via. the selected sequence (TC64920) gave 98% identity with N. tabacum EF1B -like gene (GB#: EU580435.1). to confirm the silencing of the EF1B gene in N. benthamiana, we performed RT-PCR amplification with primer pairs. in vitro viral RNA recruitment assay The TBSV viral RNA is recruited to the membrane from the soluble fraction with the help of TBSV replication proteins and host factors present in the yeast CFE. the in vitro RNA recruitment reaction was performed according to [20], [23], except that 32P-labeled DI-72 (+)repRNA were used and rCTP, rUTP, 32P-labeled UTP, and Actinomycin D were omitted from eEF1B - 32P-labeled ssRNA complex was visualized on nondenaturing 5% acrylamide gels. eEF1B - 32P-labeled ssRNA complex was visualized on nondenaturing 5% acrylamide gels."}
