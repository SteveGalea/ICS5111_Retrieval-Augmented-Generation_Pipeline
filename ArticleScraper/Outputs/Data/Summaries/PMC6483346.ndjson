{"summary": "CIRD is an endemic syndrome with multiple viral and bacterial pathogens involved in disease causation. common clinical signs include nasal discharge, coughing, respiratory distress, fever, lethargy and lower respiratory tract infections. despite widespread use of vaccines to prevent CIRD, clinical disease is still common in vaccinated dogs. the role of other bacterial agents such as Mycoplasma canis has been questioned in recent years. it is unknown whether certain Mycoplasma species such as M. canis act as a commensal, primary or secondary agent. the detection of co-infections of CIRD pathogens in a single dog has been previously documented. clinical samples submitted to the AVDL are accompanied by a paper submission form, which asks questions regarding clinical history, vaccination records and clinical signs. submission forms are then scanned and partially transcribed to an electronic database. submission forms provided no information as to whether the animals had been previously kenneled. control animals had no history of respiratory clinical disease according to the referring veterinarians and available medical records. all the data collected in this study was part of routine diagnostic work-up in client-owned animals. no additional testing or diagnostic procedures were performed for this study. all assays were performed with a positive amplification control, negative amplification control, and an exogenous internal control (Qiagen Quantifast pathogen PCR and RT-PCR internal control kit) results were interpreted taking into consideration the MIQE guidelines. synthetic DNA plasmids were purchased from GENEWIZ (South Plainfield, NJ, USA) each colony-forming unit contained one copy of the plasmid. each dilution was plated on McConkey agar (Remel) in triplicate (100l) assay exclusivity included 7 different species of Mycoplasma spp. and 12 strains of bacteria and viruses associated with respiratory diseases. gene and species identification of strains isolated at AVDL were confirmed by Sanger sequencing as previously described. all microorganisms were tested in duplicates from AVDL clinical cases. signalment (age, sex), dates (seasonality), reported clinical signs and vaccination status were recorded for each animal. differences in the rate of detection of CIRD pathogens across life stages, seasons, clinical sign categories and sex were assessed by Fisher\u2019s Exact test using Stata statistical software (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX, USA, version 15.1). Pairwise comparisons between categories were performed using the exact method in Graphpad software. a 3D network analysis was performed to determine whether specific pathogens were more likely to be associated with severe clinical disease. potential predictors included sex, age, the total number of infections, and the presence of M. cynos, M. canis, B. bronchiseptica and CPIV single infections with clinical score as a binomial response. signalment, clinical presentation and history of vaccination were retrieved from 559 of these electronically stored paper-based forms. submission forms provided no information as to whether the animals had been previously kenneled. all the data collected in this study was part of routine diagnostic work-up in client-owned animals. no additional testing or diagnostic procedures were performed for the purpose of this study. the animals investigated were not identifiable in the retrospective records. multiplex real-time PCR assay was performed using CFX96 Touch system. Primers and TaqMan-probes were manually designed using Sequencher software. specificity of primers and probes was confirmed against GeneBank sequences with BLAST. isolated colonies were used to prepare a 10-fold serial dilution from a starting 0.5 McFarland concentration. each dilution was plated on McConkey agar (Remel) in triplicate (100l) each dilution was plated on McConkey agar (Remel) in triplicate (100l) microorganism Strain/source M. canis PCR M. cynos PCR Mycoplasma spp. Mycoplasma canis ATCC 19525 + - Mycoplasma cynos Synthetic DNA + - Mycoplasma bovis ATCC 2738 - Mycoplasma cavipharyngis# AVDL - Mycoplasma insons# AVDL - Mycoplasma haemofelis AVDL - My multiplex real-time PCR assay.\u2013Negative multiplex real-time PCR assay.\u2013Negative multiplex real-time PCR assay.\u2013Negative multiplex real-time PCR assay.

P-values 0.05 were considered significant. cynos+M. canis, CPIV+B. bronchiseptica, B. bronchiseptica+M. cynos+CPIV, CPIV+M. cynos+M. canis infections were assessed using binomial generalized linear models. potential predictors included sex, age, the total number of infections, and the presence of M. cynos, M. canis, B. bronchiseptica and CPIV (29%, 33/114), M. canis (23.6%, 27/144) and M. cynos (24.5%, 28/144) were the most commonly detected pathogens followed by influenza A (11.2%, 63/559), B. bronchiseptica (9%, 51/559), CoV (4.6%, 26/559), CAV (2.5%, 14/559) and CDV (2%, 11/559). CIRD pathogens were present in animals of all age categories. puppies were more commonly infected with B. bronchiseptica and CDV compared to other age groups. influenza A virus was less common in puppies (4.43%, 7/158) than in older age categories (P 0.001) zooepidemicus was not displayed in graphs B, C and D. all samples were negative for Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus. clinical signs were PCR positive for B. bronchiseptica (n = 9), CDV (n = 4), CPIV (n = 3) and influenza A (n = 1). the most common and strongest co-infection associations were M. cynos+CPIV, M. canis+CPIV, M. cynos+CPIV+M. canis, CPIV+B. bronchiseptica and M. canis+B. bronchiseptica standard curves were constructed using mean Cq values from triplicate 10-fold dilutions of M. canis and M. cynos synthetic DNA. for M. canis the LOD was 3.08 CFU/reaction, equivalent to approximately 2.6 copies of M. canis genome per reaction. clinical performance using M. canis and M. cynos primer/probes on previously stored DNA Monoplex and multiplex assays presented different results for 5/144 samples targeting M. canis and 5/144 samples when targeting M. cynos. thus, the comparison of these two PCR systems showed an individual agreement of 96.53% for each M. canis and M. cynos. CPIV (29%, 33/114), M. canis (23.6%, 27/144) and M. cynos (24.5%, 28/144) were the most commonly detected pathogens followed by influenza A (11.2%, 63/559), B. bronchiseptica (9%, 51/559), CoV (4.6%, 26/559), CAV (2.5%, 14/559) and CDV (2%, 11/559) influenza A virus was less common in puppies (4.43%, 7/158) than in older age categories (P 0.001) all assessed pathogens were found more frequently in animals with clinical signs (mild or severe) compared to asymptomatic dogs (P 0.01). asymptomatic dogs were only positive for B. bronchiseptica (n = 1/52), CoV (n = 1/52) and M. canis (n = 4/52). clinical score 0 (asymptomatic dogs, n = 52), score 1 (cough or sneeze or nasal discharge, n = 213), score 2 (signs from score 1 in addition to fever or lethargy/depression or inappetence or pneumonia, n = 223). young age was the most significant predictor of severe clinical signs. the presence of M. cynos or CPIV was retained in all top ranked models. but their effect on the severity of clinical signs was not significant. tiology and epidemiology of CIRD associated pathogens using a molecular surveillance approach in a veterinary diagnostic laboratory. we found a low occurrence of classical CIRD pathogens such as B. bronchiseptica, CAV and CDV while identifying a higher than expected detection of bacterial agents such as M. canis. in the united states, canine influenza is caused by two subtypes: H3N8 and H3N2. this strain developed from an equine H3N8 influenza strain that was transmitted from horses to dogs. between 2011 and 2017, we found 57 PCR positive samples for influenza A. cynos was most common in dogs with moderate signs of CIRD. the age of the animals was the most significant predictor of moderate to severe clinical signs. other studies have reached similar conclusions [2, 13, 44]. PCR-based assays could potentially yield false-positive results in dogs that recently received modified live vaccines containing the specific pathogens of interest. this assumption is supported by other studies showing that Bordetella pertussis persisted on inanimate surfaces for 3\u20135 days, influenza virus for 1\u20132 days and adenovirus for 7 days. the PCR assays may yield false-negative results if samples are collected at a point in the disease process when pathogens are not present at detectable levels. key findings were that younger dogs and those with a higher number of co-infections are more likely to develop severe clinical signs, underscoring the importance of vaccination against CIRD at an early age. top ranked binomial generalized linear models for severity of clinical signs (mild vs severe) as response in dogs with CIRD."}
