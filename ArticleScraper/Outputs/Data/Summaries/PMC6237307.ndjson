{"summary": "Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) leads to healthcare-associated transmission to patients and healthcare workers with potentially fatal outcomes. aim we aimed to describe the clinical course and functional outcomes of critically ill healthcare workers with MERS. a beta coronavirus was first recovered from a patient who died of a fatal pneumonia and multi-organ failure in 2012[1, 2]. a number of published cohort studies highlighted the variable clinical presentation of MERS, which ranges between minimal or no symptoms and severe, potentially fatal pneumonia that often complicates with multi-organ failure[2\u20135]. the majority of MERS cases were reported from Saudi Arabia and were linked to healthcare outbreaks[6]. performance status 1 (PS2): Unable to work, able to live at home, care for most personal needs with a varying degree of assistance needed. Institutional Review Board approval was obtained from the Institutional Review board of the Ministry of National Guard health Affairs, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Participating HCWs were de-identified and study codes were allocated to HCWs. interventions, including medications with antiviral activities and use of steroids, as well as respiratory parameters were documented. Outcomes including ICU and hospital mortality were recorded as well. ERS was defined as a confirmed MERS-CoV infection with a positive real time RT-PCR from a respiratory tract sample. the RT-PCR assay used for diagnosis confirmation targets the upstream of the E protein gene (upE) and the region within open reading frame (ORF)1b as previously described[12].

Cough was notably absent in 7/32 (22%) HCWs. oseltamivir was used as part of management of severe acute respiratory infection in 84% (27/32) HCWs pending influenza PCR results. no significant differences were noted between survivors and non-survivors in the use of potentially MERS-CoV active antiviral agents. the remaining 11 HCW, who responded to the questionnaire, resumed working after a median of 30 (IQR 22, 45) days after hospital discharge.

(%) 3 (23) Other, no. (%) 6 (46) Time mortality among critically ill HCWs with MERS was substantial [25% (8/32)], but lower than what has been reported in general ICU MERS patients. this is probably related to the relatively younger age of the HCWs cohort compared to that of the general population MERS SARI cohort [median age (Q1, Q3) of 39 (32, 48) compared to 58 (44, 69)] only one of the pregnancies resulted in intrauterine fetal demise. the remaining 3 pregnant HCWs survived. there are no data on their long-term functional outcomes. self-reported post recovery functional limitation in two previously healthy and young HCWs are very worrisome and warrants investigation. the self-reported post recovery functional limitation in two previously healthy and young HCWs are very worrisome and warrants investigation. a previous report of a confirmed MERS in a HCW has led to over 150 tests over 3 days. lack of response from 11 HCW is a limitation in our study. this is the largest cohort of critically ill HCWs with MERS to date.
