{"summary": "positive-strand RNA viruses are responsible for prevalent and epidemic diseases in a wide range of vertebrate hosts. the rapid evolution, host species movement, and diseases of positive-strand RNA viruses demonstrate the need to develop novel strategies to prevent and treat present and new diseases caused by these viruses. RNA virus proteases therefore have been high-profile targets for development of antiviral agents. MHV encodes two papain-like proteases (PLP1 and PLP2) responsible for cleavages of nsp1 to nsp3 and an nsp5 protease, also known as 3CLpro or Mpro, that mediates maturation cleavages of nsp4 to nsp16. replicase gene (gray) consists of two open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1ab) sequence alignment of MHV-A59 and HCoV HKU1 with nonconserved residues highlighted, catalytic residues boxed, and domain separations identified. nsp5 is a cysteine protease present in all known CoVs. in vitro studies show that nsp5 dimerization is required for proteolytic activity in vitro. amino acid residues that may regulate nsp5 activity are distinct from the active site cavity, substrate-binding pocket, or dimerization interface. these findings support the hypothesis that residues distant from catalytic and substrate-binding sites are important for regulating nsp5 protease activity. however, mechanisms of communication between residues and regulation of protease activity are unknown. MHV nsp5 mutant viruses were engineered through the infectious cDNA assembly strategy described previously by Yount et al. (48) the transcribed genome and N gene were electroporated into BHK-MHVR cells. all viruses were engineered by inserting specified amino acid substitution into the MHV infectious clone (MHVic) C fragment containing the nsp5 sequence. Sense and antisense primers were designed to be overlapping with nucleotide changes in the middle of the primer. the sequences of all mutant plasmids are listed in Table 1. a confluent monolayer of DBT-9 cells in a T25 flask was infected with viral mutant stocks at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 PFU per ml. supernatant was removed from each T25 flask containing isolated mutant virus. the cells were harvested in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) for isolation of total RNA. 10 plaques were picked for each virus sample and resuspended in gel saline. flasks were removed from nonpermissive temperatures when 70 to 95% of cells had formed syncytia. RNA was isolated as described above. a query of nsp5 sequences in GenBank resulted in the identification of 432 complete coronavirus nsp5 amino acid sequences. a perl script was used to generate a representative sequence from repetitive sequences. a final alignment of 130 unique, nonredundant sequences was prepared. antisera used include nsp2-specific (VU154), nsp5-specific (VU6) and nsp8-specific (VU123) antibodies (8, 27, 39) recovery of MHV mutant viruses. ucleotide primers used in mutagenesis of MHV cDNA C fragment plasmids Mutation(s) made Primer sequence (5\u2032 3\u2032)a S133A ACG CTT CGT AGT GCC CAT ACC ATA AAG S133A/H134Y ACG CTT CGT AGT GCC TAT ACC ATA AAG S133A/T129M TTC CAT ACC ATA AAG S133A/T129M cDNA was PCR amplified using Easy-A high-fidelity PCR cloning enzyme (Stratagene) and MHV genome oligonucleotides covering the nsp5 region. amplified regions were gel purified and analyzed by sequencing. samples of supernatant were acquired and prewarmed medium was added back to maintain a fixed volume of medium for the cells. immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out as previously described (40) RESULTS Domain 2 S133A is a novel temperature-sensitive mutant of MHV nsp5. previously identified two second-site mutations that suppressed the temperature-sensitive phenotype of MHV tsV148A. mutant viruses were compared with recombinant WT MHV and with tsV148A. the engineered H134A mutant had an EOP of 101, confirming the ts phenotype reported by Sparks et al. (40). the mutant had an EOP of 2.7 105, consistent with an independent ts phenotype. reversion of tsV148A had resulted in identification of an allele at S133 that could suppress the V148A ts phenotype (S133N), but with a conservative Ala substitution resulte DBT-9 cells were infected with tsS133A at 37\u00b0C, followed by a shift to 40\u00b0C. recovered supernatant virus was used to infect cells at 40\u00b0C. RT-PCR sequencing of the nsp5 coding regions from all 10 clones confirmed the retention of the S133A. mutations in nsp5 were identical to the cognate biologically recovered mutant. the mutations showed an EOP of 103, 2 log units greater than tsS133A. the results showed that H134Y was sufficient for suppression of the ts phenotype by itself. tsS133A and all three recombinant suppressor mutant viruses demonstrated exponential growth between 10 and 12 h p.i. and achieved peak virus titers of 108 PFU/cell by 30 h p.i. the replicate virus-infected monolayers were shifted from 30\u00b0C to 40\u00b0C at 6 h p.i. the tsS133A/T129M virus was still impaired compared to mutants containing tsS133A. tsV148A and tsS133A were able to suppress two distinct and independently derived nsp5 ts alleles, tsV148A and tsS133A. this suggests an important role for intra- or intermolecular communication involved in regulation of nsp5 activity. the engineered recombinant F219L mutant was recovered at 30\u00b0C. complete genome sequencing confirmed the 10864UU-to-CUA mutations as the only changes in the genome. titer and plaque morphology of the tsF219L mutant were indistinguishable from those of WT MHV at 30\u00b0C. the virus titers were determined by plaque assay on DBT-9 cells at 30\u00b0C. identification of second-site suppressor mutations of recombinant tsF219L mutant virus. no cytopathic effect (CPE) or productive infection occurred at 40\u00b0C. HH mutant was identified among the sequenced plaques. we engineered this combination to test for the capacity of the combination to suppress the ts phenotype. all viruses were recovered at 30\u00b0C with the engineered mutations detected. tsF219L and recombinant suppressor mutant viruses were grown in DBT-9 cells at 30\u00b0C or beginning at 30\u00b0C with a shift to 40\u00b0C at 6 h p.i. tsF219L showed no further replication for 10 h p.i. tsF219 mutants require a combination of at least two second-site mutations. this may be the explanation for the tight tsF219 mutant phenotype at 40\u00b0C. the results demonstrate cooperation of H134, E285, and H270 in nsp5 for efficient virus replication. immunoprecipitation with antibodies specific for nsp2 of all lysates from WT and mutant virus-infected cells with labeling at 30\u00b0C and 40\u00b0C resulted in detection of mature processed nsp2. the presence of mature nsp2 and the p150 bands at the nonpermissive temperature indicate that both PLP1 and PLP2 domains of nsp3 are active and are not affected by the nsp5 mutations expression and processing of pp1a proteins nsp5, nsp7, nsp8 and nsp9 are accelerated at 40\u00b0C in cells infected with WT MHV. cells were radiolabeled during viral infection or mock infection. Labeled proteins were immunoprecipitated using antiserum specific for nsp2, nsp5, and nsp8. the detection of nsp5-processed proteins was profoundly decreased. we were unable from multiple replicate experiments (more than 5 experiments) to demonstrate complete loss of nsp5 activity. the results suggest that the mutations do not directly affect the catalytic functions of nsp5 but rather modify protease activity in other ways. s were determined by analyzing the crystal structure of the nsp5 protease of a closely related human CoV, HKU1. all of the second-site suppressor residue positions in HKU1 nsp5 were greater than 10 distance from the ts residues in the monomeric structure with the exception that the H134 residue is 3.8 from the juxtaposed S133. a conservation map of 100% identical nsp5 residues (black) across 130 nonredundant CoV nsp5 sequences is shown on the HKU1 nsp5 protease monomer structure. the locations of identified ts alleles (red) and suppressor alleles (green) are indicated. a sequence logo of conservation of ts and suppressor mutations was generated using WebLogo. the height of each letter corresponds to the relative conservation of that amino acid at the position, and the height of the column corresponds to the sequence conservation at the position. the residue numbers are relative to the MHV amino acid positions. the viruses were compared with recombinant MHV and with tsV148A for virus titer at 30\u00b0C and 40\u00b0C. the efficiency of plating (EOP) was calculated (titer at 40\u00b0C/titer at 30\u00b0C) the previously described tsV148A virus exhibited an EOP of 3 105. recombinant tsS133A, suppressor mutants (S133A/H134Y and S133A/T129M/H134Y), and engineered mutants (S133A/T129M) grown at 30\u00b0C (B) or grown at 30\u00b0C and then shifted to 40\u00b0C at 6 h p.i. on DBT-9 cells (C) the virus titers were determined by plaque assay on DBT-9 cells at 30\u00b0C. both biologically derived suppressor mutants contained H134Y and there were subtle differences in the EOP values. all of the engineered recombinant mutants were readily recovered at 30\u00b0C. sequencing confirmed that the engineered changes were present and no other mutations had arisen in nsp5. compared the ability of mutant viruses to replicate at permissive (30\u00b0C) and nonpermissive temperatures (40\u00b0C) in single-cycle growth experiments, we infected replicate plates of DBT-9 cells with WT and recombinant mutant viruses at 30\u00b0C and multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 PFU/cell (18, 19) at 6 h p.i., one replicate plate for each virus was transferred to the nonpermissive temperature of 40\u00b0C. S133A/H134Y and S133A/T129M/H134Y mutant viruses showed onset of exponential growth and peak titers similar to those of the WT virus following the shift. however, the virus showed a significant delay in exponential growth before achieving titers similar to those of the WT virus by 6 h after the temperature shift. the mutation confers a subtle replication defect at 30\u00b0C that is not further impaired nor complemented by the suppressor mutations. we engineered the F219L codon change as a two-nucleotide mutation (10864UU to CUA) in the isogenic MHV clone, which would require a two-nucleotide change for reversion to Phe219 (UUU or UUC) the engineered recombinant F219L mutant was recovered at 30\u00b0C, and complete genome sequencing confirmed the 10864UU-to-CUA mutations recombinant tsF219L mutant virus shifted to 40\u00b0C at 6 h p.i. titers were determined by plaque assay on DBT-9 cells at 30\u00b0C. no cytopathic effect (CPE) or productive infection occurred at 40\u00b0C. 270HH (11016CAT to 11016CATCAT) with an EOP of 1.2 or (ii) H134Y (CAT to TAT)/E285V (11061GAA to 11061GTT) with an EOP of 2.9. the identified mutations were engineered with and without F219L, alone or in the combination seen in the recovered viruses. the biologically identified second-site substitution combinations were both necessary and sufficient to suppress the tsF219L phenotype. tsF219L and recombinant suppressor mutant viruses were grown at 30\u00b0C. titers at 10 h p.i. were consistent with the EOP data (103 to 105 compared to WT) the individual mutations were capable of improved viral replication compared to the tsF219L virus yet still were ts compared to WT. at 6 h p.i., replicate monolayers were maintained at 30\u00b0C or transferred to 40\u00b0C. immunoprecipitation with antibodies specific for nsp2 of all lysates from WT and mutant virus-infected cells with labeling at 30\u00b0C and 40\u00b0C resulted in detection of mature processed nsp2. with nsp5-specific antibodies at 30\u00b0C and 40\u00b0C resulted in detection of mature processed nsp5 and probable coprecipitation of nsp5 and the 10- and 12-kDa proteins. expression and processing of pp1a proteins nsp5, nsp7, nsp8, and nsp9 are accelerated at 40\u00b0C in cells infected with WT MHV. temperature-sensitive viruses tsS133A, tsF219L, and tsV148A showed profoundly impaired processing of nsp5 and nsp8 at 40\u00b0C compared to 30\u00b0C. this was consistent with decreased detection of the reciprocal coimmunoprecipitating protein (nsp8) and decreased detection of the 10- and 12-kDa proteins. analysis of ts and suppressor mutations in nsp5 structures showed a direct correlation of detection of proteins processed by nsp5 (nsp5 and nsp8) and restored growth fitness in culture and EOP analysis in plaque assay. the distance between ts and suppressor mutations in nsp5 structures was determined by analyzing the crystal structure of the nsp5 protease of a closely related human CoV, HKU1. ization failed to predict any clear pathways of side chain remodeling or perturbation between the ts residues and the protease active site. analysis of residue conservation using an alignment of 130 nonredundant CoV nsp5 amino acid sequences identified 100% identical residues that span the regions of nsp5 between each of the ts residues. second-site suppressor mutation selected for a tyrosine that is already present in several betacoronaviruses. conservation of distinct ts and suppressor alleles within the three genera suggest that there may be select combinations of alleles that are necessary for nsp5 activity. catalytic and functional determinants have been shown to be critical for protease activity (22, 34) the current study of MHV nsp5 (3CLpro) extends our understanding of RNA virus proteases by demonstrating that multiple nonconserved and structurally distant residues in the CoV nsp5 protease participate in long-distance communication within and between the protease structural domains. potential linkage by conserved residues in nsp5 tertiary structure would be similar to the model proposed by Ranganathan and coworkers. networks of distant residues are nodes for allosteric communication (22, 42) these networks may further demonstrate coevolution of residues that maintain the protease structure. several of the recovered EAV nsp4 interdomain loop mutants did not abolish nsp4 protease activity but rather altered the substrate specificity. it is possible that the ts mutants of nsp5 are acting in a similar manner. there was more conservation of specific residues within the betacoronavirus genus. bilitated virus whose phenotype was compensated for by a mutation in nsp5 (17) ts mutations in MHV nsp3 and nsp10 resulted in altered nsp5-mediated nsp5 processing (14, 41) nsp5-mediated nsp5 processing could account for rapid emergence of second-site revertants of ts viruses. nsp5 ts mutant viruses demonstrated a defect in nsp5-mediated processing and virus replication at the nonpermissive temperature. mature nsp5 cleavage products were still detected for all three ts mutant viruses at the nonpermissive temperature. nsp5 ts mutants did not abolish nsp4 protease activity. it is possible that the ts mutants of nsp5 are acting in a similar manner. it is possible that the residues that resulted in the nsp5 ts mutations are not conserved. ts mutations in MHV nsp3 and nsp10 resulted in altered nsp5-mediated nsp5 processing. a network of nonconserved and mutationally flexible residues could account for rapid emergence of second-site revertants of ts viruses. nsp5 activity is affected by changes within the structure of the protease. the application of this data set should allow dissection of the extent and mechanism of the communication network that regulates nsp5 activity during coronavirus replication."}
