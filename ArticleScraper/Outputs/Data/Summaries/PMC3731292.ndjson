{"summary": "Sac1 is an integral membrane protein containing a large N-terminal cytoplasmic domain and two transmembrane regions near its C terminus. the arrangement of the two transmembrane regions and their role in Sac1p localization has not been determined. the polarized distribution of Sac1 is critical for maintaining a steep PtdIns(4)P gradient at the Golgi complex. al domain promotes oligomerization of Sac1 during starvation. it is a central sorting organelle guiding soluble and membrane-bound proteins. passage through the ER is also required for post-translational processing of secretory proteins. medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Thermo scientific), 1 mM glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen) cells were incubated in humidified incubator at 37\u00b0C. anti-GM130 mouse mAb was purchased from BD Biosciences. pGFP-SAC1(512\u2013549) and pGFP-SAC1(501\u2013587) were amplified by PCR using pGFP-SAC1(512\u2013587) or pGFP-SAC1(501\u2013587) as templates respectively. cDNA encoding amino acid 73\u2013801 was amplified by PCR and cloned into expression vector pEGFP-C2. pGFP-SAC1(1\u2013549)TMtfr2 and pFlag-SAC1(1\u2013549) were digested with EcoRI and SalI. pGFP-SAC1(1\u2013549)TMtfr2 and pFlag-SAC1(1\u2013549) were subcloned into vector pEGFP-C2 by using the same restriction sites. 1.5105 HeLa cells were plated into each well of a 6-well plate (Corning) containing glass coverslips and allowed to attach for 18\u201320 h at 37\u00b0C. cells were transfected with 1 g of DNA mixed with 3 l lipofectamine2000 and incubated for 24 h at 37\u00b0C. images were visualized on a Zeiss LSM 700 laser-scanning confocal microscope with a 631.4 NA Plan-Apochromat objective lens. the depicted images are typical representatives of cells expressing a particular construct. pGFP-SAC1(478\u2013587)-K2A constructs were amplified by PCR using pGFP-SAC1(512\u2013549) or pGFP-SAC1(501\u2013587) as templates respectively. cDNA fragments were digested with BamHI and SalI and ligated into pEGFP-C1 vector digested with BglII and SalI. a chimera containing the TM1 region of SAC1 was generated by overlap extension PCR. the nucleotide sequence encoding TMtfr2 was substituted with the sequence encoding the entire 23-residue TM1 of SAC1. the cDNA was digested with EcoRI and SalI and ligated into pEGFP-C2 as described above. pGFP-SAC1(478\u2013549)ins3L, pGFP-SAC1-K2Ains3L were generated by mutagenesis using primers containing the desired mutations. QuikChange II XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit was purchased from Agilent Technologies. the images were analyzed using ZEN 2009 software. the depicted images are typical representatives of cells expressing a particular construct. all localization experiments were repeated at least twice. the intracellular localization of these mutants was analyzed by confocal microscopy and compared with either endogenous GM130 or endogenous GRASP65 as Golgi markers. GFP-SAC1(1\u2013518) displayed cytoplasmic distribution but also showed some localization at the Golgi. this suggests that the region from amino acid 478 to 549, which contains TM1 and short flanking sequences, was sufficient for Golgi retention. SAC1(478\u2013549) showed the GFP signal confined to the Golgi (83% 3%; mean SD from two experiments, 50 cells each) the short GFP-SAC1(478\u2013549) construct contains all the elements that are needed for efficient Golgi retention. pGFP-SAC1(501\u2013549) and pGFP-SAC1(512\u2013549) were constructed. a cytoplasmic flanking region of TM1 is required for ER export. TfR2 is an 801-residue type II membrane protein with a small cytoplasmic domain (amino acids 1\u201380), a putative 24-residue TM domain (amino acids 81\u2013104) and a large ectodomain (amino acids 105\u2013801) at steady state, wild-type TfR2 localizes mainly to the plasma membrane and intracellular endosomes. the indicated GFP-tagged TfR2 constructs lack the N-terminal endocytic sorting motif (green) they were costained with anti-GM130 antibodies (red) or WGA647 (red) TM1 mutant, GFP-SAC1(478\u2013549)ins3L, showed accumulation at the plasma membrane and reduced Golgi staining. to test this idea, we generated a construct in which the entire N-terminal region of Sac1 was fused to TMtfr2. accumulated at the Golgi and no plasma membrane localization was observed. this result suggests that the N-terminal region of Sac1 also functions in Golgi targeting. the mutant GFP-SAC1ins3L-K2A localized to the Golgi. the TM1 region of SAC1 is not strictly required for Golgi localization of the full-length SAC1 protein that lacks the COP-I retrieval motif. however, TM1 may play additional roles in the proper folding and arrangement of the two transmembrane segments. a series of GFP and flag-tagged truncation mutants was constructed. truncation mutant flag-SAC1(478\u2013587)-K2A contains the entire cytoplasmic N-terminal domain, the transmembrane domain TM1 and six amino acids predicted to face the lumen. truncation mutant flag-SAC1(1\u2013549) contains the entire cytoplasmic N-terminal domain, the transmembrane domain TM1. confocal immunofluorescence microscopy showed that GFP-SAC1(501\u2013549) localized at both the Golgi and the ER. pGFP-SAC1(501\u2013549) and pGFP-SAC1(512\u2013549) were constructed. a cytoplasmic region that flanks TM1 causes retention at the ER. this region contains the sequence 505-DELE-508, which resembles the classical COP-II binding motif DXE [15]. however, a GFP-SAC1(478\u2013549)-E2A mutant showed no ER retention. it remains unclear whether and how this portion of the protein is required for ER export. GFP-TfR2(73\u2013801) mutant was generated in which most of the cytoplasmic domain of TfR2 containing the YQRV endocytic motif was removed. the corresponding chimera GFP-TfR2(73\u2013801)TM1 was also constructed. two cysteine residues present within TM1 of human SAC1 (FLALPIIMVVAFSMCIICLLMAG) the corresponding GFP-SAC1(478\u2013549)C2S mutant showed the same strong colocalization with the unsubstituted GFP-SAC1(478\u2013549) and no cell surface labeling was detected. the elongated TM1 mutant, GFP-SAC1(478\u2013549)ins3L, showed accumulation at the plasma membrane and reduced Golgi staining. to test this idea, we generated a construct in which the entire N-terminal region of Sac1 was fused to TMtfr2. this result suggested that the entire N-terminal region of Sac1 also functions in Golgi targeting. TM1 region of SAC1 is therefore not strictly required for Golgi localization of the full-length SAC1 protein that lacks the COP-I retrieval motif. however, TM1 may play additional roles in the proper folding and arrangement of the transmembrane segments, which is a prerequisite for ER exit. the relevance of a transmembrane segment for Golgi localization is not unprecedented. one of the two transmembrane domains in human SAC1 is sufficient for partitioning into the Golgi. the predicted length of TM1 is 23 amino acids, which is longer than the common transmembrane spanning domains of Golgi enzymes. a specific distribution of human SAC1 within the Golgi is required to establish a cis-to-trans PtdIns(4)P gradient in proliferating cells. deletion of Vps74 in yeast does not abrogate Golgi localization of Sac1p. we have identified two specific regions in human SAC1 that are independently involved in Golgi targeting. a multi-step mechanism controlling distribution of SAC1 at the cisternal Golgi. HeLa cells were transfected with the indicated GFP-tagged SAC1 constructs (green), costained with anti-GM130 antibodies (red) and analyzed by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy."}
