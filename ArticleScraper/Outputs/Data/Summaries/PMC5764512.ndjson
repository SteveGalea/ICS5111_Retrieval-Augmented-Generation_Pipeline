{"summary": "infections can have a bewildering breadth of presentations, challenging the clinician always to consider them when assessing the etiology of patient complaints. rapid detection of the causative organism is a key to diagnosis and selection of the best therapy. VZV can be clinically inferred reliably when a typical dermatomal chickenpox rash is observed. it can now be etiologically linked with neurologic syndromes through VZV DNA detection even without the typical cutaneous manifestations. it has been associated with a challenging array of primary neurologic complications as well as vastly increased risks of previously uncommon opportunistic conditions. leukoencephalopathy has emerged as a serious challenge for development of immune-modulating therapies for various inflammatory and neoplastic conditions. the shrinking world we live in has given urgency to understanding and addressing global health problems. conditions for spread of tuberculosis have underscored the importance of supporting a worldwide approach to control of infectious diseases (Chin) neuroID training is only available at a handful of larger academic departments. current leaders regularly mentor trainees interested in this discipline. alternative pathways discussed include combining neuroID with hospitalist training, neurologic intensive care training, or global health careers. full disclosure form information provided by the authors is available with the full text of this article at neurology.org/cp."}
