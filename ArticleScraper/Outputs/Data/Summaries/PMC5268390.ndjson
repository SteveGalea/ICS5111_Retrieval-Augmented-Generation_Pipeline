{"summary": "chikungunya fever is caused by fever, headache, myalgia and arthralgia. but 10\u201320% affected individuals develop persistent arthralgia. the exact molecular mechanisms underlying these manifestations are not well understood. chikungunya fever is characterized by fever, headache, myalgia and arthralgia. a small proportion of 10\u201320% of affected individuals develop persistent arthralgia. molecular mimicry in macrophages of macaca species has been demonstrated. a clinical isolate of CHIKV (Chikungunya virus strain DRDE-06; GenBank accession number: EF210157.2) was used for all the in vivo experiments in this study. a multiple sequence alignment of the E1 glycoprotein of DRDE-06 sequences and CHIKV S27 revealed a 98% homology between the two strains. was approved by institute ethics committee at NIMHANS. written informed consent was obtained from all subjects themselves. eight day old mouse pups were procured from animal facility. polyethylene glycol was added to the mixture to obtain a final concentration of 10% (w/v) and the suspension stirred on ice bath for 20 minutes. the precipitate was dissolved in 1/100th of original infected cell culture fluid volume using GTNE buffer. the antigenic peptides from E1 region were deduced after considering hydrophilicity, surface probability, chain flexibility and secondary structure antigenic index. the results obtained from the server were combined to construct a graph using MS- EXCEL, which yielded putative epitopic regions of CHIKV E1 glycoprotein. the plate was washed three times with PBST and quenched using 1% skimmed milk powder in PBST for one hour at 37\u00b0C. the plates were washed with PBST and reacted with 100l of serum samples obtained from patients infected with CHIKV (n = 36) the samples were incubated for 90 minutes at 37\u00b0C, followed by five washes with 1X PBST. CHIKV control EMEM alone (10,000PFU/50l) Group 3: CHIKV Peptide A control Two doses of peptide A (50g/dose) emulsified in Freund's incomplete adjuvant and injected on day 0 and day 5 Group 4: CHIKV Peptide B control Two doses of peptide B (50g/dose) emulsified in Freund's incomplete adjuvant and injected on day 0 and CHIKV (105 PFU/50l) was inoculated into the foot pad of 8 day old mice. blood was collected from the mice through retro orbital plexus bleeding. mice euthanized to obtain the following organs- brain, thymus, heart, lungs, spleen, liver, kidneys and upper limbs.

NIMHANS/68th IEC/2010) adheres to ethical guidelines for biomedical research on human participants. written informed consent was obtained from all subjects themselves in the study. eight day old mouse pups were procured from NIMHANS central animal research facility. the mixture was incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C, and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 30 minutes to obtain the virus rich precipitate. the precipitate was dissolved in 1/100th of original infected cell culture fluid volume using GTNE buffer. CHIKV was purified using a discontinuous sucrose gradient. the antigenic peptides from E1 region were deduced after considering hydrophilicity, surface probability, chain flexibility and secondary structure antigenic index. the results obtained from the server were combined to construct a graph using MS- EXCEL, which yielded putative epitopic regions of CHIKV. the plates were washed three times with PBST and quenched using 1% skimmed milk powder in PBST for one hour at 37\u00b0C. samples were incubated for 90 minutes at 37\u00b0C, followed by five washes with 1X PBST. rabbit polyclonal anti-human antibodies tagged with HRP (Dako, Denmark) were diluted 1:1000 and 100l was added to each well.

Salient histopathological features in lower limbs in mice injected with CHIKV specific peptides A & B (Group 4 & 5). the sequence of the African prototype of CHIKV S27 EI glycoprotein (Q8JUX5) was obtained from the SWISSPROT database and subjected to immune epitope analysis using five algorithms in IEDB and EMBOSS programs. results are depicted in Fig 1. The scores obtained for the five algorithms were uploaded into an MS Excel sheet. a given peptide is considered immunogenic and capable of eliciting an immune response in the host system. the alignment revealed two motifs SKD and KCA present only in arthritogenic Alphaviruses (CHIKV,ONNV, RRV) and not in encephalitogenic Alphaviruses (EEEV) the output of the BLAST performed on the CHIKV E1 was limited to first 100 hits. further analysis of these human proteins was limited to those known to contribute to the inflammation and arthritic pathology. 1IGY: D Intact IgG monoclonal antibody 3II7:A Kelch like protein 3GC3:A Beta arrestin 1 (adaptor protein in trafficking, bind to clathrin) 2JK4:A Voltage dependent anion channel protein 1 (mitochondrial porin) 2FAU:A Vacuolar protein sorting 26 (has arrestin fold) 1VYH:S Platelet activating factor acetyl hydrolase IB panel A shows the 3D alignment of two proteins, while panel B represents the actual areas where the structural similarity occurs. the highlighted areas in the alignment indicate the areas of structural homology between the two proteins. the cut off value for each of the peptides was calculated using the formula Mean OD of control samples + 2SD. the OD values of CHIKV positive samples towards these peptides ranged from 1.501 to 0.11 for Peptide A, while it varied from 1.501 to 0.11 for Peptide B. all three patients with persistent arthralgia showed high OD values against Peptide A (open circles) and only 2 of these 3 showed high OD values against Peptide B. ELISA determined the possible synergistic role of peptides in the enhancement of pathology in CHIKV infection. the major muscles of the hip and the shoulder had multifocal lymphocytic infiltrate in the endomysium with myonecrosis. random and occasion muscle fibres close to inflammation revealed cytoplasmic basophilia and central nucleation with prominent nucleolus indicative of regenerative activity. some of the salient features noted in CHIKV infected mice are depicted in Fig 7. no virus (Groups 3 & 4) showed myositis, muscle necrosis, vasculitis and hyperplasia of the marrow (immune mediated inflammatory muscle and marrow reactive changes) the animals in groups 7 and 8 had the highest overall inflammatory score (4+) the animals in groups 7 and 8 had the highest overall inflammation score (4+) Fig 7.
