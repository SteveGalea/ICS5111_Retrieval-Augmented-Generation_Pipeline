{"summary": "the \u2018classic\u2019 diagnosis involves five days of fever and having four of the five following criteria. if left untreated, roughly one-quarter of children will have coronary artery inflammation, including aneurysms. epidemiology The etiology of KD is unknown [4,21,22] but there is a proposed relation to an infectious agent. there are seasonal peaks of KD during winter and spring months. there are seasonal peaks of KD during winter and spring months. if a ubiquitous childhood virus is the cause of KD, the mode of entry would likely be a common mode of infection such as fecal\u2013oral or respiratory spread. mild upper respiratory symptoms have been described in up to 35% of cases [36] with rare but more significant pulmonary disease also being reported. there is a growing body of literature implicating specific B cell responses in the pathogenesis [57] there is a growing body of literature implicating specific B cell responses in the pathogenesis [57] there are no adequately specific or sensitive tests available. genetic background There appears to be a genetic influence in exhibiting KD. incidence is higher in some genetic backgrounds and consistently appears in males greater than females within those backgrounds. by age five in the united states, 1 in 1000 African-American children and 1 in 2000 Caucasian children will have been affected [17,18,19] bocavirus, bocavirus, and bacterial infections have been independently associated with coronary aneurysm formation. some non-infectious agents have also been proposed such as carpet shampoos, mercury and living near bodies of water. if a ubiquitous childhood virus is the cause of KD, the mode of entry would likely be a common mode of infection such as fecal\u2013oral or respiratory spread. oligoclonal expansion of CD8+ T cells [50] and peripheral IgM+ B cell responses have been demonstrated [5,51], and IGG+ clonality is seen in studies from our own laboratory. there is a growing body of literature implicating specific B cell responses in the pathogenesis [57] refractory treatment are steroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies. success with anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies argues against a significant role of B cells. but calcineurin inhibition would have the opposite effect by limiting T-cell help to B cells. IVIG + pulsed steroids NCT00132080 3 Completed March, 2005 No difference, refractory lower number than expected [69]. IVIG without Aspirin NCT02951234 na Recruiting August, 2019 Proposal published [71]. z- score- standard deviation from the mean. a number of studies have noted lymphocytic infiltrates in samples from later timepoints. acute infiltrates develop over time with late fibrosis occurring in the intima and adventia layers. neutrophil infiltration was quickly followed by lymphocyte infiltrates, then mixed lymphocyte and plasma cell infiltrates were demonstrated. the largest study, relying on electron microscopic studies, suggests that there is an early necrotizing arteritis indicative of an acute viral infection, followed by a vasculitis, then luminal myofibroblast proliferation. a similar pathological response is seen in inflammatory conditions such as anti-n-methyl D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) encephalitis [85], primary sclerosing cholangitis, [86] multiple sclerosis, [ peripheral lymphocyte analysis did not indicate an increase in IgA+ cells in acute, subacute and convalescent KD samples. there was actually a relative paucity of IgA+ peripheral B cells from acute, subacute and convalescent KD samples compared to controls. specific recognition by T and B lymphocytes leads to stimulation, lymphocyte replication and clonal expansion. oligoclonal expansion is shown in peripheral IgM+ B cells in KD. cloning of antibody J and association with presence of spheroid ICIs. two other rare clones showed weak binding to the same spheroid ICIs. one of these weak binding antibodies (antibody E) also bound plasma cells directly. this highlights the non-specific autoimmune potential of antibodies from these types of pathologic infiltrates. recombinant antibodies synthesized from pathologic KD specimens are of viral origin. but it is possible that these ICIs are any number of host-derived functional structures that are typically observed as protein aggregates. cytokeratin cages are not definitive of aggresomes and their presence may depend on the cell type. anti-endothelial antibodies have been shown to cause upregulation of inflammatory cytokines and apoptosis of the endothelial cells. anti-endothelial antibodies have been shown to cause upregulation of inflammatory cytokines and apoptosis of the endothelial cells. anti-endothelial antibody responses in KD have also been shown without cytokine stimulation. the case report of anti-B cell monoclonal antibody success was proposed to be due to the downregulation of such an anti-endothelial invasive effect. it remains unknown if these anti-endothelial responses actually contribute to the vasculitis in KD. vated circulating peripheral PBs are not specific to infections, as they are elevated in a number of autoimmune diseases. PB quantities tend to be significantly higher in autoimmune conditions than levels achieved during vaccination or post-infection. if KD is caused by an infection, we should observe a predictable rise of PBs in the peripheral blood. we created a panel of 946 paired heavy and light chain sequences. from the PB rise of near 11% of circulating B cells seen in subject 24, we created a panel of 946 paired heavy and light chain sequences. we compared predicted germline antibody sequences (from IMGT, [151]). treatment with IVIG in KD patients can inhibit coronary aneurysm formation. it is unclear how IVIG actually functions in this setting and if specific antibody responses are responsible for pathogenesis. the main treatment modalities used for refractory treatment are steroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies. success with anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies seemingly argues against a significant role of B cells. however, calcineurin inhibition would have the opposite effect by limiting T-cell help to B cells. kinra NCT02179853 2 recruiting December, 2020 Anakinra NCT02390596 \u201cKawakinra\u201d 2 Recruiting April, 2019 IVIG doses NCT00000520 3 Completed November, 1989 Single dose of IVIG is better than splitting doses [68]. IVIG without Aspirin NCT02951234 na Recruiting August, 2019 Proposal published [71]. studies from human peripheral lymphocyte responses are variable and inconsistent. lack of robust studies on human pathological studies on cellular infiltrates in KD is likely explained by the necessary reliance on autopsy specimens. the lack of CD20+ B cells was theorized to be from early coronary infiltration of CD20+ B cells followed by immediate switching of these B cells to plasma cells [84]. this increase in infiltrative IgA+ plasma cells could not be explained by a generalized increase in peripheral IgA+ cell, as none was shown in acute or convalescent KD. it is unclear if the clonality of the IgA+ plasma cell infiltrates seen in KD represents a global inflammatory response or a specific antibody driven response against an invasive pathogen. there have also been few published reports on the peripheral blood dynamics during KD. there have also been few published reports on the peripheral blood dynamics during KD. specific recognition by T and B lymphocytes leads to stimulation, lymphocyte replication and clonal expansion. oligoclonal plasma cell infiltrates were created from non-native pairing of the most prevalent sequences from reported plasma cell infiltrates [101,104], leading to the cloning of antibody J. oligoclonal response with just six light chains duplicated. only the J heavy (3 times) and three other heavy chains duplicated. evidence of in situ maturation of antibodies, such as A and J, does not preclude such an antibody targeting a self-antigen. a lack of genetic specificity in the included RNA argues against these being related to the etiology of KD. the authors of these studies conclude that these inclusions are of viral origin, and specifically related to the etiological agent of KD. the ICIs observed in the limited bronchial epithelial samples were also partially composed of RNA. it is reasonable to conclude that if the ICIs observed in KD patients were related to one of these structures, they would positively stain for RNA. pathogenesis eliminated by clearing serum through anti-IgG and anti-IgM sepharose columns. this does not eliminate the potential role of intra-tissue IgA+ plasma cell development in pathogenesis as has been postulated. tetanus [141], influenza [132], and rabies [142] show PB have more consistent enrichment for specific antibodies, temporally peak 5\u201310 days after immunization, and are predictive of later sero-immunity [143]. PB quantities tend to be significantly higher in autoimmune conditions than levels achieved during vaccination or post-infection. ongoing studies are exploring heavy and light chain usage in B cells and PBs during KD with next generation sequencing techniques. from the PB rise of near 11% of circulating B cells seen in subject 24, we created a panel of 946 paired heavy and light chain sequences. from this sample, there are a number of clones with exact sequence repeats (roughly 5%) stitutions (%) VH R/S * CDR1 VH R/S * CDR2 VL & CDR3 length Nucleotide substitution ratios (%) VL R/S * CDR1 VL R/S * CDR2 VL & CDR3 length Nucleotide substitution ratios (R/S) pathological specimens and model systems are variably supportive or inconsistent with what is known from human studies. whether they are bystanders activated by a superantigen effect, are responding to a self-antigen revealed by inflammation, or specific against an infectious etiology is currently unknown. machinations seem more consistent in clinical trials and epidemiological studies. this potential selection bias may be negatively influencing reproducible findings. bronchial washings should be obtained and stored for potential molecular diagnostics."}
