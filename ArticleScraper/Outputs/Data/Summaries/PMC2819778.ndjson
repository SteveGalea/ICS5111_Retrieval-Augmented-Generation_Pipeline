{"summary": "Avian colibacillosis is an infectious disease of birds caused by Escherichia coli. it causes a variety of disease manifestations in poultry including yolk sac infection, omphalitis, respiratory tract infection, swollen head syndrome, septicemia, polyserositis, coligranuloma, enteritis, cellulitis and salpingitis. salmonella infection is one of the most important bacterial diseases in poultry. avian salmonellosis is the most devastating disease worldwide. the epidemiology of fowl typhoid and pullorum disease in poultry is closely associated with transmission from one generation to the next. the birds that survive from clinical disease when infected at a young stage may show few signs of infection but can become carriers. colibacillosis is a gram-negative, non-acid-fast, uniform staining, non-spore-forming bacillus that grows aerobically and anaerobically. some strains, such as those designated as avian pathogenic E. coli, spread into various internal organs and cause colibacillosis characterized by systemic fatal disease. a large number of different E. coli types is present in a single bird. the risk for colibacillosis increases with increasing infection pressure in the environment. a small-scale comparison of commensal and pathogenic isolates revealed 83% of pathogenic strains belong to only five clones. clonal relationships were found for O2:K1 isolates from humans and chickens. clonal relationships were found for O78 isolates from humans, cattle, sheep, pigs and chickens. a well-documented ability of avian E. coli to spread to human beings. potential for APEC to act as human UPEC or as a reservoir of virulence genes for UPEC. papC, papEF, papG, including papG, including papG alleles I, II, and III;

APEC causes yolk sac infections and embryo mortality. the chick can also be infected during or shortly after hatching. enteropathogenic E. coli (ETEC) isolated from chickens suffering from diarrhoea. APEC may cause enteritis in combination with coronavirus. in turkeys, experimentally inoculated EPEC can only cause enteritis. colibacillosis is a rare form of colibacillosis, but in affected flocks it may cause up to 75% mortality. pathogenicity depends on invasive properties and ability of the bacteria to survive and multiply within the cells, particularly macrophages. the main site of multiplication of these bacteria is the digestive tract. pullorum disease manifests itself predominantly as an enteric disease of chickens. fowl typhoid is indistinguishable from pullorum disease unless the etiological agent is isolated and identified. the virulence factors contributing to the pathogenesis of avian colibacillosis are summarized in Table 3. the virulence factors contributing to the pathogenesis of avian colibacillosis are summarized in Table 3. coli-induced oophoritis or salpingitis may infect the internal egg. the latter possibility is considered as the main route of infection for the egg. the chick can also be infected during or shortly after hatching. enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) isolated from chickens suffering from diarrhoea. in turkeys, experimentally inoculated EPEC can only cause enteritis. in layers, salpingitis can lead to the loss of egg-laying capacity. avian colibacillosis is a rare form of colibacillosis, but in affected flocks it may cause up to 75% mortality. pathogenicity depends on the invasive properties and the ability of the bacteria to survive and multiply within the cells, particularly macrophages. thelial tissues (RES), such as liver and spleen, are the main sites of multiplication [176]. in case of inadequate body defense mechanism, they may lead to second invasion and be localized in other organs, particularly ovary, oviduct, myocardium, pericardium, gizzard, yolk sac and/or lungs. the diagnosis is obtained by E. coli isolation from cardiac blood and affected tissues, like liver, spleen, pericard or bone marrow. isolation is possible from six hours to three days after infection. in subacute cases, isolation is only possible until seven days after infection. ISA test for the diagnosis of avian salmonellosis has been established. it is recommended to vent the incubators and hatchers to the outside. it is recommended to have as few breeder flocks as possible per breeding unit. vaccines based on killed or attenuated strains have been tested experimentally. they give sufficient protection against homologous strains, but protection against heterologous strains is less efficient. vaccines based on fimbriae also give a good homologous protection. a first step is the prevention of egg contamination by fumigating them within two hours after lay, and by removing cracked eggs or eggs soiled with faecal material. in chicks, contamination with APEC from the environment must be controlled by reduction and control of intestinal infection. this is possible by using mycoplasma-free birds and protecting the birds against mycoplasmas and viral diseases by vaccinations. a certain degree of heterologous protection obtained with an inactivated vaccine is obtained. vaccines based on virulence factors like fimbriae also give a good homologous protection against APEC possessing the same fimbriae. public health concerns of Avian Colibacillosis and Avian Salmonellosis E. coli of the O2:K1 serotype isolated from human urinary tract infections and from septicemic chickens are highly related. contrasting results were obtained in a study by caya et al. [197] the older the bird, the more restricted the colonisation and persistence were. all birds involved in the experiment remained clinically healthy. chicken meat was sometimes positive for VTEC. the risk of salmonellosis can be reduced through simple precautions. by wrapping fresh meats in plastic bags at the market to prevent fluids from dripping on other foods."}
