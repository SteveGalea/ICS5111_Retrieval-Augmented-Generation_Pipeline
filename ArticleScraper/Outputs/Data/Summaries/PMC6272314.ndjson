{"summary": "duchenne muscular dystrophy is a severe muscle wasting X-linked genetic disease. the disease is caused by the almost complete absence of the dystrophin protein due to out-of-frame mutations in the DMD gene. the disease is caused by the almost complete absence of the dystrophin protein due to out-of-frame mutations. the most widely used mouse model of DMD is the mdx mouse which has a point mutation in exon 23. this model exhibits an obvious skeletal phenotype including elevated creatine kinase plasma levels, irregular muscle histology, muscle necrosis and a decline in specific force and power with age. DMD patients generally receive early ventilatory intervention due to the rapid deterioration in respiratory function. this intervention would be likely to improve pulmonary hypertension and thus may compensate for RV dysfunction. this review focuses on the cardiac aspects of DMD. dystrophin is involved in signaling through its association to the dystroglycan complex (DGC) at the cysteine-rich domain and C-terminus and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) at its rod domain. absence of this protein renders both skeletal and cardiac cells more susceptible to damage upon muscle contraction. intracellular Ca2+ increases intracellular Ca2+ via SERCA and other cell membrane Ca2+-permeable channels. increased Ca2+ increases CaMKII and PKA which hyper-phosphorylate Ca2+ channels on the SR. increased [Ca2+]i elicits multiple detrimental events [24,30] increased intracellular Ca2+ in the heart leads to mitochondrial deregulation, protease calpain-mediated necrosis and NF-B activation. it activates Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM) and CaM kinase II (CaMKII) and protein kinase A (PKA) which hyper-phosphorylate Ca2+ channels. calsequestrin and sarcalumenin are involved in sequest membrane tears were suggested to arise from a fragile membrane due to the absence of dystrophin. this would make the membrane leaky, allowing the influx and efflux of ions and proteins [28,36]. membrane sealant lowered, but not abolished, increased Ca2+ influx and improved left ventricular end diastolic volume in mdx mice. the role of TRPC1 in the heart remains elusive. a more recent experiment did not see an involvement of TRPC1 channels in skeletal myotubes. 2+ channel is linked to F-actin by subsarcolemmal proteins including dystrophin and -actinin [61,62] and is thought to be involved in contraction [63]. in mdx mouse hearts, the l-type Ca2+ channel exhibits a delayed inactivation rate and interestingly, even though action potential duration is not affected, significant ECG abnormalities are observed. indirect evidence of RyR involvement in the mdx heart is seen. increased SR Ca2+ leak was observed in 3\u20134 and 12\u201315 month old mice. these events are also observed in arrhythmias and heart failure. iNOS is only expressed in the cell during inflammation and partly responsible for the inflammatory response seen in DMD [40,41] nNOS is displaced, with significantly lower nNOS activity levels in patients and mdx mice [49,50] the function of nNOS in the heart is currently being investigated. mitochondrial energy production is one of the first pathophysiological changes known to occur in mdx heart. mdx mice were assessed at 10\u201312 weeks of age, considered the pre-cardiomyopathic stage, and revealed a slight shift in energy consumption. oxidative capacity of the mitochondria is also disturbed in the mdx mouse model. the mitochondria are able to regulate intracellular Ca2+ and ROS balance. long-term opening of this channel is thought to be detrimental to the cell. but long-term opening of this channel is thought to be detrimental to the cell. membrane tears and stretch-activated channels (SACs) have been proposed as possible mechanisms. the initial intracellular Ca2+ increase brings about the activation of store-operated channels (SOCs) such as sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA), the ryanodine receptor (RyR) and the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) receptor (IP3) receptor (IP3R the increase in [Ca2+]i could be mediated by both direct entry of Ca2+ ions through SACs and indirect entry through the Na+/Ca2+-exchanger (NCX) or voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCC) that open due to Na+-induced membrane depolarization [38,53,55,56,57]. mdx cardiomyocytes exhibit increased TRPV2 expression at the plasma membrane. inhibition of these channels with non-specific blockers and targeted siRNAs reduced cellular Ca2+ influx upon osmotic stress. TRPC6 channels are also sensitive to stretch contraction. expression levels of SERCA in the mdx heart appear to be similar to that of wild-type (WT), though other reports have shown down-regulation [46,47]. this may be attributed to age, where older mice would exhibit a reduction in SERCA channels. hyper-phosphorylation of RyR leads to dissociation from calstabin 2, a stabilizing protein. membrane tears were suggested to arise from a fragile membrane due to the absence of dystrophin. this would make the membrane leaky, allowing the influx and efflux of ions and proteins [28,36]. this would make the membrane leaky, allowing the influx and efflux of ions and proteins [28,36] ions through SACs, and indirect entry through the Na+/Ca2+-exchanger (NCX) or voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCC) that open due to Na+-induced membrane depolarization. these channels include the mechano-sensitive transient receptor potential cation channels, namely TRPC1, TRPC3, TRPC6 and TRPV2. l-type Ca2+ channel is linked to F-actin by subsarcolemmal proteins including dystrophin and -actinin [61,62] and is thought to be involved in contraction [63] in mdx mouse hearts, the l-type Ca2+ channel exhibits a delayed inactivation rate and interestingly, even though action potential duration is not affected, significant ECG abnormalities are observed. hyper-phosphorylation of RyR leads to dissociation from calstabin 2, a stabilizing protein. this disrupts Ca2+ regulation whereby the SR becomes leaky. this in turn disrupts Ca2+ regulation whereby the SR becomes leaky. eNOS is associated with caveolin 3 on the sarcolemma and nNOS is associated with the sarcolemma. iNOS is only expressed in the cell during inflammation and partly responsible for the inflammatory response seen in DMD [40,41] nNOS is displaced, with considerably lower nNOS activity levels in patients and mdx mice [49,50] mitochondrial energy production is one of the first pathophysiological changes known to occur in mdx heart. mdx mice were assessed at 10\u201312 weeks of age, considered the pre-cardiomyopathic stage, and revealed a slight shift in energy consumption. mitochondrial function is also disturbed in the mdx mouse model. rising [Ca2+]i is thought to induce a sudden increase in mitochondrial membrane permeability through the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) short-term opening of these channels is thought to be beneficial as the mitochondria are able to regulate intracellular Ca2+ and ROS balance. however, long-term opening of this channel is thought to be detrimental to the cell and induces necrosis of the mitochondria. ACE inhibitors prevent the conversion of angiotensin-I to angiotensin-II (Ang-II), thereby reducing circulating levels of the Ang-II. beta-blockers prevent binding of catecholamines by interfering with -receptor binding, thus reducing sympathetic nervous system activity. the drugs losartan and pirfenidone have been investigated for their anti-fibrotic properties. the drugs losartan and pirfenidone have been investigated for their anti-fibrotic properties. the combination of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, ibuprofen, and an NO donor, isosorbide dinitrate, were capable of preventing morphological changes in the heart of mdx mice [105]. a recent phase 1 clinical trial using this combinatory therapy demonstrated an excellent safety profile in healthy patients [106]. this provides a solid basis for further trials in muscular dystrophy patients. therapy Specific Strategy Research Stage and Selected References Utrophin up-regulation Utrophin transgene Preclinical\u2014mdx/utrn/ Transgenic utrophin expression. treatment reduced pathology in quadriceps and diaphragm and improved pathology in TA. mdx RTC13 showed better efficacy (restored dystrophin in skeletal muscle and heart) than gentamicin, PTC124 and RTC14. improved muscle function and decreased serum CK. micro-dystrophin administration in young mdx induced dystrophin expression and slowed progression of cardiac phenotype. 10 mo mice expressed dystrophin and cardiac function improved. clinical: 6 mg/kg was maximal tolerated dose in patients. Phase III trial did not meet 6MWD endpoint. clinically: well tolerated and dystrophin present after 48 weeks. high dose IV illustrated impressive exon skipping notably in heart (72%) improvements in cardiac function, with preserved diastolic function after 6 months. long-term IV administration prevented deterioration in heart function in the event of exercise. utrophin appears to have many of the same binding proteins, including certain components of the DAPC and F-actin [173,174,176]. despite functional differences, it is believed that utrophin could partially compensate for dystrophin function. utrophin up-regulation is also seen in mdx skeletal muscle. utrophin compensation is unable to completely restore pathology. it is not yet clear if utrophin can fully compensate for the absence of dystrophin. utrophin up-regulation remains a very valuable therapeutic option. ataluren undergoing clinical trials whereby the drug was well tolerated and most importantly, read-through of normal stop codons did not occur. a sensitive small-molecule screen was performed, which identified compounds RTC13 and RTC14. these compounds were subsequently administered intramuscularly and intravenously in mdx mice. rAAV6 microdystrophin was successful at transfection and induction of dystrophin in young mdx mice. however, heart function did not recover even though dystrophin was restored in the heart and heart mass was normal [129] micro-dystrophin rAAV9 administration in young and adult mdx mice also induced dystrophin expression. viral vectors are promising candidates for the delivery of the dystrophin gene. however, immunosuppression may be implemented to reduce this risk. repeat administration is problematic due to the presence of neutralizing antibodies from the first administration. iPS cells were modified in vitro with the use of nucleases. they were used to induce exon skipping, shift the reading frame or insert the missing exon with successful results. the knock-in of the missing exon was most effective if done intramuscularly. therapy is capable of treating 83% of patients with dystrophin mutations, specifically 79% of patients with deletions, 91% with small mutations and 73% with duplications. a significant shortfall is that AONs can only specifically target one exon at a time. current efforts are focused on exons which would assist the greatest numbers of patients. Arginine rich CPPS conjugated to PMO were the first to show activity in the heart [163] and further showed that sustained treatment improved cardiac function and resistance to dobutamine stress [158] the phage peptides have been less successful in restoring cardiac dystrophin and function, with the exception of a 7-mer phage (conjugated to 2\u2032OMePS) utrophin up-regulation was one of the first therapeutic strategies developed to compensate for the lack of dystrophin in the cell. utrophin is a homologue of dystrophin with a molecular weight of 395 kDa and a similar amino acid composition. utrophin appears to have many of the same binding proteins, including certain components of the DAPC and F-actin. it is believed that utrophin could partially compensate for dystrophin function. utrophin up-regulation is also seen in mdx skeletal muscle and cardiac pathology. utrophin compensation is unable to completely restore pathology. it is not yet clear if utrophin can fully compensate for the absence of dystrophin. utrophin up-regulation remains a very valuable therapeutic option. the results from this clinical trial clearly show that a better understanding regarding subgroups of patients and their functional outcomes is needed. a sensitive small-molecule screen was performed, which identified compounds RTC13 and RTC14. these compounds were subsequently administered intramuscularly and intravenously in mdx mice treated with RTC13. rAAV6 microdystrophin was successful at transfection and induction of dystrophin in young mdx mice. however, heart function did not recover even though dystrophin was restored in the heart and heart mass was normal [129] micro-dystrophin rAAV9 administration in young and adult mdx mice also induced dystrophin expression. human population carries antibodies towards many prevalent viruses, such as AAV [182,187], though immunosuppression may be implemented to reduce this risk. repeat administration is problematic due to the presence of neutralizing antibodies from the first administration [180]. further research is needed to eliminate these concerns. iPS cells were used in vitro to induce exon skipping, shift the reading frame or insert the missing exon with successful results. iPS cells were differentiated into skeletal muscle cells and dystrophin expression was observed. the knock-in of the missing exon was most effective [193] phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs) [149] and 2\u2032O methyl phosphorothioate (2\u2032OMePS) both have shown promising results in the clinic. a new chemistry, tricyclo-DNA, has demonstrated marked preclinical success and was capable of restoring dystrophin in the heart. more recently, the Pip6 series has demonstrated dystrophin expression in the heart at very low doses (12.5 mg/kg) [166] and prevented exercise-induced cardiomyopathy following long-term treatment. the phage peptides have been less successful in restoring cardiac dystrophin and function, with the exception of a 7-mer phage. studies in dog models have highlighted inevitable obstacles due to our complex immune system. this is impossible to avoid given the requirement of a systemic approach to treat a disease which is devastating to the entire body. current pharmacological interventions can only delay or partially ameliorate the symptoms of this disease. improvements have been made to improve skeletal muscle phenotype. pharmacological treatments to stabilize cardiac function are in use. mortality from cardiorespiratory complications in patients remains high."}
