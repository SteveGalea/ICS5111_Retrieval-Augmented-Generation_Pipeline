{"summary": "the importance of disaster response has drawn more attention than ever in Korea. however, sufficient learning and legislature have exposed limitations in the disaster management system. the recent efforts to change the disaster response system has exposed many limitations. studies on disaster resilience have been increasing in recent years. the term \u201cresilience\u201d refers to a concept that demonstrates the attributes of the ecosystem as a system. after a disaster, our society requires resilience to return to normalcy following the disaster\u2019s physical and social impact. people worldwide, including in china, were infected and approximately 770 people died. however, Korea had only three confirmed SARS patients and no deaths. by 2015, however, more than 10 years later, the reputation regarding infectious disease response had been tarnished by systematic problems and the absence of disaster management and communication capacity. cholera patients were identified for the first time in 15 years in 2016. despite continued outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases, there have been no noticeable changes in prevention and response measures. experts have warned that this is only the beginning of the war against infectious diseases. studies in the medical field must precede the response to infectious diseases, so that information and knowledge about the infectious disease can be applied in response measures. if the national infectious disease response system is not ready when an actual infectious disease outbreak occurs, then medical determination and response, as well as crisis management and communication cannot be executed properly. factors that influence disaster response will be categorized from a system theory perspective to form a categorization framework. most of the studies on disaster response analyzed actual cases by applying analytical tools based on major variables presented in existing studies and theories. the present study aimed to organize factors and variables that influence disaster response from a comprehensive and systematic perspective. human resources included disaster response-related organizations and agencies, education and training of relevant organizations and the general public and utilization of specialists. the establishment of disaster response-related organizations or crisis management centers and the securement of specialists have a very significant influence on disaster response [49,51]. intergovernmental relationships and communication are also factors that influence disaster response. inter-organizational communication and coordination, network and cooperation were analyzed as factors that positively influence disaster response [54,63,64] SARS SARS stands for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. it has a latency period of 10 days after which the victim experiences high fever (38 \u00b0C), coughing and respiratory distress. it is transmitted by respiratory routes to medical staff and family members who come in close contact with the patient. a quarantine system was established by designating 41 hospitals as isolation treatment hospitals according to regions. a system through which patients suspected of being infected could be transported immediately for isolation. a meeting for city and provincial quarantine officials and experts was held on 23 April 2003. a 68-year-old male was returning home to the region after a visit to the middle east. he was treated at a clinic for a fever he developed seven days after arriving in the region. after his visit, he received inpatient treatment for three days. he was eventually admitted to a single-bed unit at the Samsung Medical Center in Seoul on 18 May 2015. the first MERS patient in Korea visited multiple clinics and large hospitals for treatment. the MERS outbreak exposed fundamental problems in the public healthcare system and vulnerabilities in the national quarantine system. the socioeconomic impact of MERS has not been accurately assessed. the entire Korean society has become more interested in infectious diseases. infectious diseases include Class 1\u20135 of infectious diseases, designated infectious diseases, bioterror infectious diseases, sexually transmitted diseases, zoonotic infectious diseases and healthcare-associated infections. despite continued outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases since the SARS outbreak, there have been no noticeable changes in prevention and response measures. studies in the medical field must precede the response to infectious diseases, so that information and knowledge about the infectious disease can be applied in response measures. if the national infectious disease response system is not ready when an actual infectious disease outbreak occurs, then medical determination and response cannot be executed properly. present study analyzed two cases of infectious disease outbreaks based on the factors that influence disaster response. the factors that influence disaster response have been identified through numerous studies over several years. most of the studies on disaster response analyzed actual cases by applying analytical tools based on major variables presented in existing studies. financial resources can be regarded as the disaster-related budget, the disaster management fund and financial support measures. human resources included disaster response-related organizations and agencies, education and training of relevant organizations and the general public and utilization of specialists. identification of disaster response-related organizations and agencies must come first to allow effective communication about disaster response. the president\u2019s level of interest in disaster management and response and the governance style in running an organization, were analyzed as factors that have significant influence on disaster response [61]. onsite leadership by the heads of organizations and agencies must be demonstrated in a timely manner. intergovernmental relationships and communication are also factors that influence disaster response. a study by Byun (2014) examined fire service organizations and thus effectiveness was determined by evaluating fire containment and rescue. efficiency was represented by reduction in damage and cost-effectiveness. other factors influencing disaster response include environmental factors, disaster characteristics and legislative factors. health institutions, including 12 national quarantine stations and 242 health centers, maintained a 24-hour emergency operation-ready status. a quarantine system was established by designating 41 hospitals as isolation treatment hospitals according to regions. additional isolation measures were implemented for people who came in contact with infected patients to prevent the disease from spreading further. the outbreak started on 24 April 2015 following its introduction into the middle east by a 68-year-old male. the patient was treated at a clinic for a fever he developed seven days after arriving in Korea but his condition did not improve. after his visit to the clinic, he received inpatient treatment for three days at Pyeongtaek St. Mary\u2019s Hospital and was subsequently discharged. there was confusion due to lack of clarity in the delegation of roles between the central and regional governments. the cooperation system between health authorities and medical institutions did not operate smoothly either. the outbreak exposed fundamental problems in the public healthcare system and vulnerabilities in the quarantine system. 305 patients with SARS had been identified in china between November 16, 2002 and 9 February 2003, five of whom had died. a total of 8098 suspected SARS cases from a total of 28 countries were identified. a total of 774 SARS related deaths were reported between November 2002 and July 2003. a meeting for city and provincial quarantine officials and experts was held on 3 April 2003. on 23 April 2003, a discussion was held on measures of blocking the importation of SARS and preventing its spread. the decision to implement government-wide response measures by setting up a central SARS measures headquarter was made. the first MERS patient in Korea visited multiple clinics and large hospitals for treatment over a 10-day period. the highest number of confirmed MERS cases outside of the Middle East region was found in Korea. the response to MERS completely exposed contradictions in the national quarantine system, as well the healthcare system. study design 3.1. Factor Categorization The objective of this study was to inductively explore the factors that influence response based on studies related to disaster and infectious disease response. the study also aimed to perform successive meta-analyses to present a model based on detailed explanation and revision of the previously established factors influencing disaster response. studies that presented communication, coordination, cooperation and network as the mediating variables for effective disaster response included those by [3,50,55,71] other studies selected the process level variable as one variable among many independent variables in analyzing the influence on effective disaster response. this model was presented because disasters act as a single system that includes the aforementioned factors, regardless of their type (natural or social disaster) the strength of the influencing factors may vary depending on the type of disaster but because they were described and analyzed by the factors that are presented below, analyzing or describing social and natural disasters using different frameworks is unnecessary. reier et al. listed theory building, theory explication and theory development as the three overlapping goals of qualitative meta-analysis. the protocol was constructed through data collection and analysis and effort was made to ensure reliability and validity of the study. all searched articles were tallied and data were selected through validity testing and unanimity with fellow researchers. the search process used the Naver news site and the official home pages of each newspaper. a total of 38 cases of audit reports for various organizations were selected for the analysis. the study aimed to perform successive meta-analyses to present a model based on detailed explanation and revision of previously established factors influencing disaster response. the incomplete preliminary theoretical framework represented simplification and categorization of major factors through existing studies. precedent studies previously examined in Chapter 2 were used to derive the factors influencing disaster response from a system perspective. independent variables influenced disaster response through cooperative decision-making processes, meaning open and honest exchange of opinions, shared model construction, negotiation and utilization of relevant knowledge and information. the proposed research model was used to conduct social network analysis through content analysis, in-depth case analysis on countries that were victims of terrorist attacks. qualitative meta-analysis is different from meta-analysis which integrates results from existing empirical studies using a quantitative method. qualitative meta-analysis involves interpretive analysis, which strives to include major concepts that appeared in individual qualitative studies. data were codified and categorized on the basis of the meta-analysis framework. for the factors identified from the data, the factor and source were recorded, and evidence of the correlation was identified. evidence included statistical data, media reports, interviews with experts and claims made by authors. a total of 38 cases of audit reports for various organizations were selected for the analysis (Table 1). a total of 38 cases of audit reports for various organizations were selected for the analysis. a total of 38 cases of audit reports for various organizations were selected for the analysis. this caused confusion in the response process because of the possibility of arbitrary decisions, it had a negative influence on onsite response. financial resources, human resources, physical resources, information and education and training were identified as the input factors influencing disaster response. agency in charge of the control tower emerged as a factor that interfered with infectious disease response. interest of local citizens, meaning regional self-centeredness, caused designation of SARS quarantine hospitals to be nullified, acting as a factor that interfered with infectious disease response. study conducted meta-analyses and in-depth interviews to analyze the correlations of factors influencing infectious disease response in a Korean context. the findings were identified through meta-analyses and in-depth interviews and should be considered in the improvement the infectious disease response system in Korea. the legislative factor indirectly influenced disaster response, making it an important factor that influences the overall disaster response process. the study also found that the establishment of legislation had an overall impact on infectious disease response. the results showed that most input factors, including physical resources, human resources and information were insufficient. nondisclosure of hospital names by the government had an impact on spread of infectious diseases and on failed initial response. the general public voluntarily shared information and made the effort to share accurate information. the interests of local citizens and departments also acted as a factor that interfered with effective infectious disease response."}
