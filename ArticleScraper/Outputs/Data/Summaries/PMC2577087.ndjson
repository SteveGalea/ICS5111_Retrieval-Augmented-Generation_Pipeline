{"summary": "more than 100,000 cases of HFRS are reported annually, with a mortality rate between 2% and 10%. HTNV is a spherical, enveloped virus with a genome composed of three segments of single-stranded, negative-sense RNA. the three segments are designated as large (L), medium (M) and small (S) segments that encode RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. IL-2 is one of the extensively studied cytokine adjuvants. it increased the development of antigen-specific immune response and protective immunity against challenge with the infectious agents. previous studies have shown that co-expression of IL-2 has also been shown to enhance the immune response to the HSV1 glycoprotein D antigen in DNA vaccines. eukaryotic expression plasmid DNA vector was amplified from plasmid PUC19-IL-2 (Department of molecular biology, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China) the full-length IL-2 DNA was amplified from plasmid PUC19-IL-2 (Department of molecular biology, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China encoding G2 gene by PCR using primers(forward, 5'- GGGGTACCTACGGGCTGCAAGTGCTTCTGAAAC -3'reverse, 5'- CCGCTCGAGTAGGACTATGCCTTCTTGTGC -3') designed to introduce KpnI and XhIrestriction sites at 5' and 3'ends of the amplicons, respectively, and subcloned into pcDNA3.1/IL-2 at the cell lysates were run on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and then transferred electrophoretically to a nitrocellulose membrane. the membranes were incubated with monoclonal antibody (MAb) against IL-2 (Santa Cruz, CA, USA, at 1:50 dilution) cells cultured at 37\u00b0C in a shaking incubator overnight. a final concentration of 0.3 mM of IPTG was added to the culture. the cells were harvested by centrifugation in 50 ml volumes. serum HTNV G2 and IL-2 specific antibodies Sera were collected from a retroorbital plexus puncture 10 days after last protein boost or an animal's tail vein puncture of immunized mice at weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 and 16. the sera were serially diluted and reacted with G2 and IL-2 antigen. HRP-SPA conjugate was used as secondary antibody. spleens were removed from immunized mice and purified by lymphocytes separation medium. the mice splenocytes suspension were applied in 96-well tissue culture plates and co-incubated for 68 h with HTNV G2 and IL-2 antigen. extinction coefficient was measured at 490 nm. transient expression experiments were performed with COS-7 cells (COS-7, GDC054, China Center for Type Culture Collection, China) all cell types were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) the reconstruct plasmids were introduced into transformation-competent E. coli DH5 (TaKaRa, Japan) and cultured overnight. the presence of the inserted DNA fragment was confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion and gel electrophoresis. the presence of the inserted DNA fragment was confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion. the transfected COS-7 cells were fixed in PBS containing 4% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 15 min at RT, followed by extensive washing with PBS. after blocking in PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin, the cells were incubated with anti-G2 Mab or polyclonal mouse anti-IL2 antibody for 1 h at RT. mice were immunized with 100 g of pcDNA3.1/HTNV-IL-2, pcDNA3.1/HTNV-IL-2, pcDNA3.1/HTNV-G2, pcDNA3.1/HTNV-IL-2-G2, pcDNA3.1 (+) plasmids (in 50 l of PBS) and pcDNA3.1 (+) plasmids (in 50 l of PBS) serum HTNV G2 and IL-2 specific antibodies Sera were collected from a retroorbital plexus puncture 10 days after last protein boost. the sera were serially diluted and reacted with G2 and IL-2 antigen. the titers were defined as the reciprocal of the positive highest serum dilution. spleens were removed from immunized mice and purified by lymphocytes separation medium. the mice splenocytes suspension were applied in 96-well tissue culture plates. they were co-incubated for 68 h with HTNV G2 and IL-2 antigen. the plasmid pcDNA3.1/IL-2 was constructed by inserting the HindIII and an KpnIdigested the PCR-amplified IL-2 DNA fragment into HindIII and an KpnIdigested pcDNA3.1. the plasmid pcDNA3.1/HTNV-IL-2-G2 was constructed by inserting the KpnI and XhIdigested HTNV G2 DNA fragment into the KpnI western blot analysis of protein expression of vaccine DNA in transfected COS-7 cells. Lane 1 and 2, lysate of transfected COS-7 cells with pcDNA3.1/HTNV-IL-2-G2 were incubated with mouse anti-IL-2 and anti-G2 Mab. Lane 3 and 4, lysate of IL-2 and G2 protein with mouse anti-IL-2 antibody and mouse anti-G2 Mab. neutralization test in vitro used to detect humoral immune response in immunized mice. ELISA results showed that the average titer of the specific antibody against HTNV G2 was 1:70. the specific antibody of the average titer of pcDNA3.1/HTNV-IL-2-G2 group against HTNV G2 and IL-2 was 1:100. pcDNA3.1/HTNV-IL-2-G2 immunized mice could elicit neutralizing antibodies with different titers. but the neutralizing antibody titers were low (Table 1). the detection of neutralizing antibody titers in the sera of immunized mice group of animals Animals No. the plasmid pcDNA3.1/HTNV-IL-2-G2 was constructed by inserting the HindIII and an KpnIdigested HTNV G2 DNA fragment into the KpnI and EcoRI sites of pcDNA3.1/IL-2 plasmid upstream and in frame with the IL-2 gene. the immunoblots showed a large protein band of about 72 kDa present in COS-7 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1 lysate of transfected COS-7 cells with pcDNA3.1/HTNV-IL-2-G2 were incubated with mouse anti-IL-2 and anti-G2 Mab. Lane 5 and 6, lysate of transfected COS-7 cells with pcDNA3.1(+)were incubated with mouse anti-IL-2 antibody and mouse anti-G2 Mab. ELISA and cell microculture neutralization test in vitro were used to detect the humoral immune response in immunized mice. the stimulation index of splenocytes to G2 was measured by MTT assay. the specific antibody of the average titer against HTNV G2 was 1:70. pcDNA3.1/HTNV-IL-2-G2 immunized mice could elicit neutralizing antibodies with different titers. but the neutralizing antibody titers were low (Table 1). the detection of neutralizing antibody titers in the sera of immunized mice Group of animals Animals No. a novel chimeric HTNV IL2-G2 DNA vaccine was developed by genetically linking IL2 gene to the full-length G2 segment DNA. RT-PCR and western blot analysis results proved by mRNA and protein levels that the recombinant vector was transiently expressed in COS-7 cells. the stimulation indexes of splenocytes to IL2 and IL-2 were measured by lymphocyte proliferation assay. ELISA results showed that the chimeric gene could simultaneously elicit specific antibody against IL-2 and G2. the chimeric gene could also evoke cellular immune response in mice. authors' contributions HH carried out molecular genetic studies, participated in the sequence alignment and drafted the manuscript.
