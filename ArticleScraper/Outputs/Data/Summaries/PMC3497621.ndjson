{"summary": "RVFV is a spherical enveloped virus with a diameter of 90 to 100 nm and a tripartite, single-stranded RNA genome in a negative and ambisense orientation. the envelope proteins, Gn and Gc, are arranged into pentameric and hexameric units to form a unique T=12 icosahedral structure (37) RVFV entry is thought to occur via endocytosis, since clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), caveola-mediated endocytosis (CavME) and macropinocytosis (67) the best-studied and most common method of virus entry is CME. the formation of clathrin-coated pits is a constitutive process but can also be actively initiated by its cargo. caveolae are highly structured lipid raft microdomains enriched in caveolin-1 (CAV-1), cholesterol, and sphingolipids. caveolins are scaffolding proteins, expressed on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane, that interact with gangliosides, integrins, and cholesterol. some viruses that are known to enter cells via CavME include nonenveloped viruses. macropinocytosis is mediated by phosphinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK-1) and macropinosome closure, facilitated by PI3K and PAK-1 phosphorylation of C-terminal binding protein 1 (CtBP-1). vaccinia virus (64, 66), ebola virus (71, 88), african swine fever virus RVFV MP-12 was derived from the wild-type Egyptian strain ZH548 by propagation for 12 serial tissue culture passages in presence of the mutagenic agent 5-fluorouracil (15). in vitro tropism of RVFV MP-12 seems not to be altered from that of WT RVFV, making it likely that cellular factors required for RVFV entry are also necessary. the recombinant RVFV vaccine strain MP-12 generated to carry a green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene (RVFV-MP-12-GFP) in place of the NSs gene has been described previously (47). the recombinant VacV expressing GFP (VSV-GFP) was obtained through the NIH Biodefense and Emerging Infections Research Resources Repository. p21-activated kinase peptide inhibitor (PAK18) (20 M), inactive control peptide PAK18-R192A (PAK-NC) (20 M), p21-activated kinase inhibitor III (IPA-3) (10 M), a Rac1 inhibitor (100 M), a cell-permeant 17-hydroxy analog of wortmannin (HWT), a PI3K inhibitor (0.5 M), cytochalasin D the lysosomotropic agent ammonium chloride (NH4Cl; 50 mM), the serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid (OA pre; 100 nM), and the cationic amphiphilic compound chlorpromazine (CPZ; 6.5 g/ml; Sigma) were also incubated with 50 M DMSO. untreated cells were incubated with the indicated virus for 1 h prior to and during incubation with RVFV-MP-12-GFP, VacV-GFP, or VSV-GFP at an MOI of 1 for 3 h at 37\u00b0C. untreated cells were incubated with the indicated virus for 2 h, washed with PBS, and then incubated with complete medium alone or with 100 nM OA for 1 h.

Alternatively, cells were incubated for 1 h with RVFV-MP-12-GFP. the inhibitors were present during the 3 h of incubation with authentic RVFV MP-12 (A, B, and C) or RVFV-MP-12-GFP (D) at an MOI of 1. (A) Infection of 293T cells was detected by flow cytometry using anti-RVFV polyclonal antibodies (green) and the nuclear dye DAPI (blue) alamarBlue reagent was added to cells in complete medium for 4 h. cells were then washed with PBS and incubated for 45 min at 37\u00b0C. fluorescence was measured at EX488/EM 510 after freeze-thawing. cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature (RT), then washed once with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) samples infected with authentic RVFV MP-12 were incubated with 300 nM 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) in PBS for 2 min at RT, washed twice with PBS, and left in PBS for imaging. images were taken with a DAPI filter (EX330 to 490/EM515) to capture infection; to visualize the nuclei, images were taken with a DAPI filter (EX330 to 385/EM420) data are representative of results from three similar experiments. cells were counted as infected if their FL-1 fluorescence was greater than that of untreated or DMSO-treated, uninfected cells. the quantity of infected cells relative to that of untreated or DMSO-treated, uninfected cells is given as the percentage of infection. the FlexiTube GeneSolution siRNAs were four different siRNA constructs that were resuspended at 20 M. the individual siRNAs were mixed together in 1 tube at a 1:1:1:1 ratio and were transfected into HeLa or HepG2 cells at a final concentration of 50 nM. the siRNAs that resulted in the specific maximum decrease in the expected target without altering cell viability were used. fluorescence was measured at EX570/EM590; then cells were washed with PBS. 50 l of the Thermo Scientific RIPA buffer with 1 Halt protease inhibitors was added per well. the percentage of infection was determined by taking cells transfected with SCMBLD siRNA as 100% infected. the data represent one of three experiments with similar results. rabbit anti-EPS15 (1:200), rabbit anti-PAK-1 (1:200), rabbit anti-PI3K p85 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology [SCBT]) for 1 h to overnight in a block. proteins were visualized with an HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-actin polyclonal antibody (Novus) at 1:1,000. the mCherry reporter gene was assembled similarly to WT-CAV-1. the sequence coding the first 81 amino acids was removed and replaced with a start codon (Cav1-81). control EPS15-mCherry (clone D3D2; control EPS15; control EPS15; DN-EPS15; control EPS15; DN-EPS15; control EPS15; DN-EPS15; control EPS15; DN-EPS15; control EPS15; DN-EPS15; DN-EPS15; DN-EPS15; DN-EPS15; DN-EPS15; DN-EPS15; DN-EPS15 cells were washed twice with PBS, put in a block for 1 h, then incubated with mouse anti-c-Myc or rabbit anti-GST (1:100) in a block for 1 h. all transfected cells were incubated with 300 nM DAPI in PBS for 2 min at RT, washed twice with PBS, imaged at a magnification of 40 using an Olympus IX70 microscope. images are representative of samples were incubated with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min prior to resuspension in PBS. untransfected and transfected cells were incubated with mouse anti-c-myc or rabbit anti-gST (1:100) in permeabilization buffer. gates were set using untransfected and uninfected controls. untransfected cells were similarly probed with anti-c-Myc, anti-GST, and an appropriate secondary antibody. the quadrants were set based on the FL-1 and FL-2 values of untransfected/uninfected controls. for each cell type, the gates were set based on the level of expression of each plasmid (FL-2) in the absence of infection. infected cells expressing low, medium, or high levels of WT-PAK-1 or DN-PAK-1 were incubated with RVFV-MP-12-GFP, VacV-GFP, or VSV-GFP at an MOI of 1 for 3 h. the quantity of infected cells expressing low, medium, or high levels of WT-PAK-1 is given as the percentage of infection. SV-GFP values were considered significant when they were 0.05 (single asterisk) and very significant when they were 0.01 (double asterisk). RESULTS Role of macropinocytosis and actin in RVFV entry. inhibitors were used at concentrations that have been shown previously to block target activity. pretreatment with the inhibitors at concentrations that are known to specifically block macropinocytosis significantly decreased VacV-GFP infection of HeLa and HepG2 cells. the inhibitors were also present during the 3 h of incubation with RVFV-MP-12-GFP at an MOI of 1 at 37\u00b0C. Alternatively, cells were incubated for 1 h with RVFV-MP-12-GFP at an MOI of 1 at 37\u00b0C. then cells were washed to remove unbound virus and were incubated with 10, 25, or 50 M EIPA (post) for 4 h. infection of HeLa and HepG2 cells with VacV-GFP was reduced by 60% 6.3% with 25 M EIPA and by 65% 7.0% with 50 M EIPA. the effect observed with EIPA was not specific to the entry of RVFV-MP-12-GFP. treatment with actin filament production inhibitor cytochalasin D (CD), actin monomer-sequestering drug latrunculin A (LA) and actin-stabilizing drug jasplakinolide (JP) has been shown to inhibit VSV endocytosis, suggesting that actin assembly is also important for CME (120). clathrin-mediated endocytosis and caveolin-mediated endocytosis in RVFV entry. VacV-GFP is partially sensitive to acidification inhibitors. VSV-GFP infection was reduced by 73% 3.4% in HeLa cells. RVFV-MP-12-GFP and VacV-GFP infection of HepG2 cells was unaffected. results suggest RVFV entry is dependent on dynamin II. PMA treatment reduced the level of RVFV-MP-12-GFP infection of HeLa cells by 79% 0.8% and of HepG2 cells by 61% 2.5%. in contrast, treatment of cells with PMA had no significant effect on infection with VacV-GFP or VSV-GFP. binding enhanced RVFV-MP-12-GFP infection of HeLa cells by 173% 19%, and that of HepG2 cells by an average of 165% 13.7%. VacV-GFP infection was unaffected by treatment with OA before, during, or after incubation with virus. this suggests that RVFV entry is distinct from VacV or VSV entry. inhibitors of CavME decrease the percentage of cells infected with RVFV-MP-12-GFP and authentic RVFV-MP-12. the recombinant RVFV vaccine strain MP-12 lacking the NSs gene is an extremely useful tool for rapid and sensitive screening of inhibitors of RVFV (47) flow cytometry was used to measure the percentage of cells infected with authentic RVFV MP-12 or recombinant RVFV-MP-12-GFP. treatment of 293T cells, HeLa cells, and HepG2 cells with CPZ and macropinocytosis inhibitors also had no effect on the percentage of cells infected with RVFV MP-12. the percentage of 293T cells infected with RVFV MP-12 was reduced by an average of 71% 2.2% with DYN, by 56% 6.0% with OA, by 64% 7.7% with Nys plus Prog, and by 77% 0.1% with PMA. the percentage of cells infected with RVFV MP-12 in the presence of these inhibitors was reduced to levels similar to those measured by IFA, flow cytometry, and GFP fluorescence. protein expression in siRNA-transfected cells was assessed by immunoblotting. expression of all target proteins was most consistently reduced between 60 h and 72 h posttransfection. in subsequent experiments, siRNA-transfected cells were infected with the virus at an MOI of 1at 60 h posttransfection. downregulation of PAK-1 and PI3K decreased VacV-GFP infection of HeLa cells by averages of 52% 8.0% and 51% 6.3%. expression of dominant negative caveolin-1 blocks RVFV infection. expression of dominant negative caveolin-1 overwhelms the wild-type proteins. at 24 h posttransfection, cells were incubated with RVFV-MP-12-GFP, VacV-GFP, or VSV-GFP at an MOI of 1 for 3 h at 37\u00b0C. cells were then washed and incubated overnight in complete medium. the cells were then fixed and processed for fluorescence microscopy or flow cytometry. expression of DN-EPS15 had no effect on RVFV-MP-12-GFP or VacV-GFP infection. but decreased VSV-GFP infection by an average of 57% 5.0% in HeLa cells. levels of RVFV-MP-12-GFP and VSV-GFP infection were the same in cells expressing DN-PAK-1. cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, treated with DAPI to visualize the nuclei (blue) infection of mCherry-expressing cells with a recombinant virus expressing GFP was observed using a 40 objective on an Olympus IX70 microscope. images were cropped, but relative cell sizes were maintained. infection of mCherry-expressing cells with a recombinant virus expressing GFP was observed using an Olympus IX70 microscope. images were cropped, but relative cell sizes were maintained. the images are representative of results from three independent experiments with similar results. RVFV entry, HeLa and HepG2 cells were pretreated with an inhibitor of Rac (RAC-I), PAK-1 inhibitors PAK-1 inhibitor peptide (PAK18) and PAK-1 inhibitor III (IPA-3) the pretreated cells were then infected at an MOI of 1 with the attenuated RVFV strain MP-12 expressing GFP. each virus used in these experiments is a recombinant strain that expresses GFP upon entry and replication. HeLa (A) or HepG2 (B) cells were either left untreated (NI) or pretreated with 50 M DMSO, 20 M PAK18, 20 M PAK-NC, 10 M IPA-3, 100 M Rac-I, 50 M Ly294002, or 0.5 M HWT for 1 h. the inhibitors were also present during the 3 h of incubation with RVFV-MP-12-GFP, VacV-GFP, or VSV- the percentage of infection was determined by taking untreated or DMSO-treated samples as 100% infected. another common method for analyzing the role of macropinocytosis is to treat cells with the Na+/H+ exchange inhibitor ethyl-N-isopropyl amiloride (EIPA) prior to and during infection. RVFV-MP-12-GFP was added 1 h after infection with RVFV-MP-12-GFP at an MOI of 1. blocking of endosomal acidification 1 h postinfection has no effect on infection. treatment of cells with 50 M EIPA reduced infection to the same extent as pretreatment. cells were treated with each inhibitor prior to and during incubation with RVFV-MP-12-GFP, VacV-GFP, or VSV-GFP at an MOI of 1. infection with VacV-GFP was significantly decreased with LA. RVFV-MP-12-GFP infection was unaffected by CD and LA. VacV-GFP infection was reduced by 41% 5.0% in NH4Cl-treated HeLa cells. treatment of cells with DYN decreased RVFV-MP-12-GFP infection by 73% 6.3% in HeLa cells and by 77% 2.0% in HepG2 cells. depletion of cholesterol from the plasma membrane reduces the number of invaginated caveolae (16, 43, 55) to address the role of CavME in RVFV infection, cells were treated with nystatin and progesterone (Nys plus Prog) and the PKC activator phorbol 12-myristate 13 acetate (PMA) prior to and during incubation with the viruses indicated in Fig. 2 (MOI, 1). cells were treated with okadaic acid (OA), a serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor. the addition of OA 1 to 2 h after virus addition promotes CavME of bound cargo. incubation with OA 1 h after virus addition has no effect on VSV infection. treatment with NH4Cl 40 min to 1 h postinfection had no effect on infection with UUKV or RVFV-MP-12. agents that specifically affect entry should have no effect on infection when added 1 h postinfection. we used a 96-well immunofluorescence assay (IFA) to quantitatively analyze the percentage of cells infected with authentic nonrecombinant RVFV MP-12. at 16 h postinfection, cells were fixed, and infection was visualized by IFA. cells treated with inhibitors resuspended in H2O were compared to untreated cells. treatment of 293T cells, HeLa cells, and HepG2 cells with CPZ and macropinocytosis inhibitors also had no effect on the percentage of cells infected with RVFV MP-12. treatment of 293T cells with CPZ and macropinocytosis inhibitors also had no effect on the percentage of cells infected with RVFV MP-12. to block CME and macropinocytosis, we used siRNA to dynamin II (DMN2) to specifically block CME, we used siRNA targeted to caveolin-1 (CAV-1), and to specifically block macropinocytosis. we also used siRNA targeted to vacuolar H+-ATPase (ATP6V1A) to block vacuolar acidification. decrease in RVFV-MP-12-GFP infection correlated well with decreased steady-state levels of CAV-1 at 60 h posttransfection. VacV-GFP and VSV-GFP infection of HeLa and HepG2 cells was unaffected by CAV-1 downregulation. function of endocytosis pathways in virus entry is to express DN mutant versions of cellular proteins in target cells. overexpression of mutants overwhelms the wild-type proteins and prevents their function. this approach has been used extensively to characterize the entry pathways of multiple viruses. flow cytometry was used to quantify the effect of the expression of DN mutants on infection with RVFV-MP-12-GFP, VacV-GFP, or VSV-GFP. in cells expressing DN-CAV-1, VacV-GFP infection was decreased by an average of 61% 6.3% in HeLa cells and by 52% 3.8% in 293T cells. VacV-GFP infection and VSV-GFP infection were unaffected by DN- expression of DN-PAK-1 decreased VacV infection by an average of 63% 0.6% in HeLa cells and by 40% 2.8% in 293T cells. these results confirm the specificity of the DN mutants and demonstrate that CavME is required for RVFV entry. expression of dominant negative caveolin-1 blocks RVFV infection. mCherry-expressing cells with a recombinant virus expressing GFP were incubated with RVFV-MP-12-GFP (A), VacV-GFP (B), or VSV-GFP (C) at an MOI of 1 for 3 h. mCherry-expressing cells with a recombinant virus expressing GFP were incubated with a recombinant virus expressing GFP. infected cells expressing low, medium, or high levels of control-EPS15-mCherry or DN-EPS15-mCherry are given as the percentage of infection. DISCUSSION Viruses are obligate parasites that have developed multiple ways to exploit host cell processes so as to support infection. treatment with dynamin II inhibitor dynasore or OA blocked both CavME and CME. inhibition of PP2A prevents endosome fusion with lysosome, which has a positive effect on SV40 infection. ant RVFV expressing GFP in place of NSs, as well as infection with authentic RVFV MP-12. similar results were obtained regardless of whether infection was measured by GFP fluorescence using a plate reader, by immunofluorescence microscopy, or by flow cytometry. suppression of DN-CAV-1 activity reduced RVFV infection but had no effect on CME or macropinocytosis. VacV infection observed by imaging and flow cytometry. CPZ, siRNA, and microscopy indicate a role for CME in the entry of bunyaviruses Hantaan virus, Oropouche virus, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus. the majority of UUKV particles were located in noncoated, small cytoplasmic vesicles (58), consistent with small caveolar vesicles. a recent study found that the majority of UUKV particles were located in noncoated, small cytoplasmic vesicles. this suggests that the three amino acid differences between MP-12 and wild-type RVFV strains are unlikely to change the entry mechanism of the virus. docytic pathway has been analyzed in mammalian cells. there are no studies of CavME as an entry pathway for viruses in insect cells. caveolins are evolutionarily conserved from humans to nematodes."}
