{"summary": "Nbs contain four constant regions, named framework regions (FRs) and three connecting variable regions, called complementarity determining regions (CDRs) FRs are responsible for maintaining the structural integrity of Nbs, while CDRs directly bind to antigen epitopes (3). MERS-CoV was first identified in June 2012. there is an urgent need to develop highly potent anti-MERS-CoV therapeutics and vaccines with the potential for large-scale industrial production. the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of MERS-CoV spike protein is a prime target for therapeutic antibodies. produced Nbs can overcome potential limitations, e.g., low binding affinity for the RBD and relatively short half-life in the body. we immunized llama with recombinant MERS-CoV RBD protein and constructed its human-Fc-fused version, NbMS10-Fc. this study reveals efficacious, robust, and broad-spectrum Nbs can be produced to target MERS-CoV S protein RBD. both NbMS10 and NbMS10-Fc were expressed in yeast cells. the estimated molecular weights were about 16 kDa for NbMS10 and 50 kDa for NbMS10-Fc. these MERS-CoV RBD-specific Nbs from llama, but not severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) were recognized by anti-llama antibodies. the identified VHH coding gene containing a C-terminal His6 or human IgG1 Fc was inserted into Pichia pastoris yeast expression vector pPICZA to construct NbMS10 and NbMS10-Fc respectively. the Nbs were subjected to SDS-PAGE or Western blotting, followed by detection using anti-llama antibody. Detection of NbMS10 and NbMS10-Fc neutralizing activity against MERS-CoV infection (EMC2012 strain) by a microneutralization assay. the measured 50% neutralization doses were 3.52 g/ml for NbMS10 and 2.33 g/ml for NbMS10-Fc. recombinant MERS-CoV RBD interacted with cell surface-expressed DPP4 in the presence or absence of recombinant Nbs. the binding to MERS-CoV RBD suggests that the Nb-binding site and the DPP4-binding site overlap on the MERS-CoV RBD. flow cytometry analysis of NbMS10 and NbMS10-Fc in inhibiting the binding between MERS-CoV RBD and cell-associated hDPP4 receptor. the percent inhibition was calculated as the RBD-hDPP4 binding in the presence or absence of Nbs according to the following formula: (1 RBD-hDPP4-Nb/RBD-hDPP4) 100. a significant difference occurred between NbMS10 and NbMS10-Fc in inhibition of RBD-hDPP4 binding. ELISA detected the binding between DPP4 and MERS-CoV RBD bearing the D539A mutation. the results showed that the D539A mutation significantly reduced the binding of the RBD to DPP4. the Nbs and DPP4 compete for the same region on MERS-CoV RBD. the data are presented as mean A450 values the SD (n = 4). a significant difference occurred between MERS-WT and MERS-D539A in binding to hDPP4 protein by ELISA. the Nbs recognize the conformational epitope on the RBD. in the absence of the Nbs, MERS-CoV RBD binds tightly to the DPP4 receptor. the Nbs bind tightly to the RBD in the same D539-containing region. cross-neutralizing activity of Nbs against divergent MERS-CoV strains. results showed both Nbs potently neutralized the cell entry of all of the MERS-CoV pseudoviruses. cross-neutralizing activity against existing MERS-CoV strains. a pseudovirus-based neutralization assay was performed to evaluate the cross-neutralizing activity of Nbs against divergent MERS-CoV isolates. b RBD residues mutated in the S protein of the respective pseudotyped MERS-CoV mutants are indicated. sera were collected from mice injected with NbMS10 (A), NbMS10-Fc (B), or PBS control (C), and then tested by ELISA for binding with the MERS-CoV S1 protein. compared to monomeric Nb, Fc-fused Nb has a significantly extended in vivo half-life likely due to its dimeric structure. mice treated with NbMS10-Fc had a 100% survival rate and steady weight. mice treated with trastuzumab on day 1 postinfection also had a 100% survival rate. hDPP4-Tg mice were treated with NbMS10-Fc 3 days before infection. Virus-challenged mice were monitored for 14 days to evaluate survival rate and body weight changes. significant differences (** and ***) are indicated between the NbMS10-Fc and control groups. MERS-CoV RBD-specific Nbs from llama, but not severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) RBD-specific MAbs from mice were recognized by anti-llama antibodies. so, the yeast-expressed Nbs maintained native conformation and antigenicity. RNA was extracted to synthesize cDNA via RT-PCR. SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses of purified NbMS10 and NbMS10-Fc. the plates were coated with MERS-CoV S1-His or RBD-Fd protein. the data are presented as mean A450 values the standard deviation (SDs) (n = 2). neutrtralizing activity of Nbs was recorded as the concentration of Nbs in complete inhibition of MERS-CoV-induced CPE in at least 50% of the wells (ND50) the data are expressed as mean ND50 the SD (n = 3) the experiments were repeated twice, and similar results were obtained. to investigate the mechanism underlying the neutralizing activities of Nbs, we evaluated the competition between the Nbs and hDPP4 for the binding to MERS-CoV RBD. recombinant MERS-CoV RBD interacted with cell-surface-expressed DPP4 in the presence or absence of recombinant Nbs. gray shading indicates the Huh-7 cell control. the blue line indicates the binding of MERS-CoV RBD to Huh-7 cells. the percent inhibition values are shown in each graph. the data are presented as the mean percent inhibition the SD (n = 2). To map the binding site of the Nbs on MERS-CoV RBD, we performed alanine scanning on the surface of MERS-CoV RBD. the results showed that NbMS10 demonstrated tight binding to the alanine-containing RBD mutants. the results demonstrate that Nbs recognize the epitope on MERS-CoV RBD. this epitope also plays an important role in DPP4 binding. mutations in this region can reduce binding of both the Nbs and DPP4. the binding between Nbs and MERS-CoV RBD was detected by ELISA. the plates were coated with RBD-Fd protein (2 g/ml) and treated with or without DTT. the data are presented as mean A450 values the SD (n = 2).

DISCUSSION MERS-CoV continues to infect humans with a high fatality rate. the constant and continuing transmissions of MERS-CoV from camels to humans make it difficult to eradicate MERS-CoV from the human population. values for NbMS10 and NbMS10-Fc to bind MERS-CoV RBD ranged from 7.12 108 M to 4.47 1011 M (29, 35, 36) ND50 values for RBD-specific conventional IgGs to neutralize various MERS-CoV strains ranged from micrograms/ml to nanograms/ml. the potential short half-life of Nbs can be overcome by adding the appropriate tag to the Nbs to increase their half-life. the MERS-CoV RBD-targeting Nbs potently neutralize MERS-CoV entry into host cells. the broad neutralizing spectrum of the Nbs results from the binding site of the Nbs on MERS-CoV RBD. mutations in this region can eliminate the binding of the Nbs to MERS-CoV RBD and thus lead to viral immune evasion. however, mutations in this region also reduce the binding of MERS-CoV RBD to receptor DPP4 and hence decrease the efficiency of viral entry. residues 484 to 567) derived from natural MERS-CoV isolates were aligned, and residues with natural mutations are shown. the numbers on the left indicate the counts of MERS-CoV-specific Nbs with the identical sequence in the analyzed region. they also overcome potential limitations of other Nbs by maintaining a high binding affinity for their target MERS-CoV RBD. cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) using a TransScript cDNA Synthesis SuperMix (TransGen Biotech, China), followed by PCR amplification of the N-terminal IgG heavy-chain fragment (700 bp) the VHH gene (300 to 450 bp) was amplified using the above DNA fragment as the template and the forward primer VHH-FR1-D-F (5\u2032-TTTCTATTACTAGGCCC recombinant MERS-CoV RBD-Fc and Fc of human IgG1 proteins were analyzed. one of five positive clones, CAb10, with the highest binding to MERS-CoV RBD, was selected for further analyses.
