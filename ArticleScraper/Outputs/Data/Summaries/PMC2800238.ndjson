{"summary": "the viral enzyme complex contains an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) as its core catalytic subunit for the production of negative strand RNA (\u2013RNA), new genome molecules and in many virus groups also subgenomic (sg) messenger RNAs (mRNAs) (1,3) the group is also known for its exceptionally large polycistronic genome of 30 kb. the arterivirus and CoV sg RNAs derive from a discontinuous step during minus-strand RNA synthesis that is guided by specific RNA signals. this mechanism produces a set of subgenome-length negative-strand templates from which the sg mRNAs are produced. the unusual genome size of CoVs and the complexity of their RNA synthesis hint at an RdRp that may have special properties. the 932-amino-acid subunit, now known as nsp12, was confidently aligned with the conserved motifs of well-known viral RdRps (22,23). biochemical information on the CoV RdRp has, however, remained scarce thus far, particularly since full-length nsp12 was refractory to expression in bacterial systems. ubiquitin generates a recombinant nsp12 protein containing its natural N-terminus. full-length nsp12 can readily synthesize RNA in a primer-dependent fashion on homo- and heteropolymeric RNA templates. this work provides a solid basis for the further biochemical characterization of the coronavirus nsp12. the ubiquitin-nsp12-His6 fusion gene (Ub-nsp12-CHis6) was subcloned into vector pASK3 (IBA) this ruled out the known risk of potential contamination with a tetracycline-inducible promoter. chloramphenicol (34 g/ml) was inoculated 1:1000 with 3 ml o/n precultures. cells were grown at 37\u00b0C to OD600 >0.7. cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS\u2013PAGE) found to be 80\u201385% pure. gel filtration on a superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) in 20 mM HEPES, 500 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 5 mM -mercaptoethanol and 0.1% Tween-20 was used to improve purity to 95%. western blotting Cells were lysed in Laemmli\u2019s sample buffer (28) blot membranes were blocked with 10% skimmed milk and 0.02% Tween-20 in PBS. blot membranes were blocked with 10% skimmed milk and 0.02% Tween-20 in PBS. oligonucleotide mixtures in annealing buffer were heat denatured, slowly cooled to room temperature and then purified from 15% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. glycerol and NaCl were introduced with the addition of enzyme due to their presence in the nsp12 storage buffer. a 102\u2013105 dilution series of the [-32P]ATP stock was spotted in triplicate on Whatman filter and exposed alongside the PAGE gel of interest. phosphorimager counts were converted into the amount of label incorporation and kinetic traces were fit to a linear function with the MATLAB 2008b Curve Fitting Toolbox. nsp12-coding region was amplified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from the genome of SARS-CoV Frankfurt-1 (AY291315) the ribosomal frameshift near the 5\u2032-end of the gene was corrected in a translationally silent manner. the PCR amplicon was digested with SacII and BamHI, and ligated into expression vector pASK3 (26) nsp12 expression vectors pKM596-nsp12 and pET102-Thio-nsp12 were used to transform cells. expression was performed using the auto-induction medium ZYM-5052. cell debris was removed by ultra-centrifugation at 20 000 g. the cleared supernatant was incubated with Talon beads (Clontech) for 2 h at 4\u00b0C. eluate was analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS\u2013PAGE) blot membranes were blocked with 10% skimmed milk and 0.02% Tween-20 in PBS. blots were washed with 0.02% Tween-20 in PBS, washed and subjected to chemiluminescence detection (GE Healthcare) UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUAUAACUUAAUCUCUCACAUAGC-3\u2032 and SAV556R 5\u2032-UCUCUCUCUCUCUCUCACAUAGC-3\u2032 were purchased from Eurogentec. oligonucleotide mixtures in annealing buffer were heat denatured, slowly cooled to room temperature and then purified. gels were run for 5 h at 2000 V and analyzed using phosphorimaging. a 102\u2013105 dilution series of the [-32P]ATP stock was spotted in triplicate on Whatman filter and exposed alongside the PAGE gel of interest. expression and purification of full-length SARS-CoV nsp12 A PCR amplicon encoding SARS-CoV nsp12 was first cloned into T7 expression vector pET26-Ub-CHis6, which provided the 932-aa viral protein with an N-terminal Ub tag (76 amino acids) the protease that was later used to remove the Ub tag was not co-expressed and the expression of the full-length expression of nsp12 was performed in the presence of the ubiquitin (Ub) protease Ubp1. this in vivo cleavage created the native nsp12 amino-terminus. similar results were reported by Cheng et al. (24) for a GST-nsp12 fusion protein. a native N-terminus is required for the proper folding of the RdRp\u2019s \u2018fingers\u2019 subdomain and the positioning of the 3Dpol active site. these findings suggest that N-terminal additions might also hamper the proper folding of the SARS-CoV RdRp and could thus be the principal cause of its subsequent degradation. we therefore co-expressed the C-terminal Ub protease Ubp1 (26), which specifically recognizes the cleavage non-denaturing gel filtration yielded a single peak corresponding to a size of about 140 10 kDa. this is different from the calculated mass of 106 kDa, but may be explained by, e.g. a very open or nonglobular structure of the protein. future structural studies involving electron microscopy or crystallography will hopefully allow us to address this question in more detail. oligonucleotide products of nsp8 activity would serve as primers for the viral \u2018main RdRp\u2019, i.e. nsp12. some observations were consistent with the possibility that the SARS-CoV main RdRp belongs to the class of primer-dependent polymerases. wild-type nsp12 was able to elongate the 20-mer primer. the mutant showed 8 3% residual activity (mean of three independent experiments) nsp12 variants were visualized by silver staining of an SDS\u2013PAGE gel. mutant protein displayed only 8 3% residual primer extension activity in our assays. further or complete knockdown of activity may be obtained under slightly different assay conditions or in combination with substitution of other active site residues. all subsequent experiments were performed at 30\u00b0C. however, the major extension product never matched the length of the primer plus 10 nt. this suggests that nsp12 generally terminates before reaching the end of the primed poly(U template. the presence of Mn2+ in an RdRp assay decreased the fidelity of the SARS-CoV nsp12 relative to Mg2+. the specificity for the nucleotide\u2019s sugar moiety seemed not affected, however, since deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP) was not incorporated when using an RNA template in the presence of Mn2+. manganese ions promote misincorporation of ribonucleotides. the selection against dATP remained unaltered. to establish the importance of pH, we tested nsp12 activity in the pH range of 6.0\u20138.5. quently, the percentage of bound template and the Hill equation were used to derive the enzyme\u2019s dissociation constants (Kd) for dsRNA the Kd was calculated at 0.13 0.03 M, whereas the Kd for ssRNA was estimated to be 0.10 0.02 M. on a primed U10 template we found relatively poor incorporation rates (1.2 0.4 nM/min) and a major product that was 2\u20133 nt shorter than the expected full-length product. we also observed minor products that were slightly longer than full length, suggesting slippage of the polymerase at the end of the template. U20 to a heteromeric (CU)10 increased the nucleotide incorporation rate by 34%, but also the behavior of nsp12 on the template. products of the expected full-length size (p + 20) were observed, but also products longer than the template, hinting at, e.g. template switching by nsp12. sp12 activity increased further (V(CU)10 = 45 2 nM/min) and reached a level comparable to that obtained for other viral RdRps on similar short templates (40). similar products extending beyond unit length have been often observed when short templates were used for PV 3Dpol (43) expression and purification of nsp12 fusion proteins resulted in the abundant and progressive fragmentation of the protein. expression and purification of nsp12 fusion proteins was performed in the presence of the ubiquitin (Ub) protease Ubp1. this in vivo cleavage created the native nsp12 amino-terminus with the sequence SADAS. nsp12-specific polyclonal antiserum identified a single band of the expected mass after purification of the in vivo cleaved expression product. similar results were reported by Cheng et al. (24) for a GST-nsp12 fusion protein. fusion protein is located between the Ub moiety and the N-terminus of nsp12. proteolytic cleavage of the fusion protein at this site liberated an nsp12-CHis6 product. expression of the Ubp1 protease was driven by the relatively weak constitutive ADH1 promoter (26) to ensure optimal release of nsp12 by the protease. essentially viral RdRps employ only two fundamentally different mechanisms during the first step of RNA synthesis. initiation can occur either de novo, when the 3\u2032 hydroxyl group of the first nucleotide is the \u2018primer\u2019 to which a second nucleotide is added. initiation can depend on an oligonucleotide or protein primer (32) we monitored the incorporation of nucleotides on a well-defined synthetic RNA template. this template consisted of a 20-nt duplex and a 3\u2032 overhang of 10 uridylates. primer extension was revealed by both the incorporation of [-32P]ATP and the extension of the 32P-labeled primer (Figure 2C) two nsp12 variants were visualized by silver staining of an SDS\u2013PAGE gel. it was previously concluded that the canonical aspartic acid residues responsible for the coordination of the divalent cation should be nsp12 residues 618, 760 and 761. the influence of reaction temperature on RdRp activity was tested within the range of 20\u201337\u00b0C. activity at 37\u00b0C was 40% higher than at 30\u00b0C, which is more commonly used in RdRp assays. the activity of nsp12 was positively correlated with the Mg2+ concentration and reached its optimum at 6 mM. higher concentrations (20 mM) ultimately abolished activity. the presence of Mn2+ in an RdRp assay decreased the fidelity of the SARS-CoV nsp12 relative to Mg2+ and facilitated transversional and transitional misincorporations. nucleotide incorporation fidelity of nsp12 was more important than the presence of a 2\u2032 hydroxyl group (40). the reactions were initiated with a limiting concentration of [-32P]ATP. after 10 min, different nucleotides were added to a final concentration of 50 M to allow elongation for another 30 min. ations, bovine serum albumin and spermidine were found. no negative influence of potassium or sodium ions was observed below a concentration of 50 mM. addition of spermidine, which binds to the phosphate backbone of nucleic acids, did not improve activity in the tested concentration range up to 5 mM. in vitro studies have defined biochemical properties that could not be determined or were largely obscured in in vivo assays. nsp12 nucleotide incorporation rates For various viral RdRps, in vitro studies have defined biochemical properties that could not be determined or were largely obscured in in vivo assays. gel analysis showed that the major accumulating product is the primer (p) extended by 7 nt (i.e. p + 7) and not the expected full-length product of n + 10. reactions were performed as in Figure 6A, but now using a DNA template. nsp12 was able to incorporate [-32P] deoxyadenosine monophosphate (dAMP) when using a DNA template. on average, a minor reduction (20%) in dAMP incorporation was observed. the size distribution of products was more different, and showed significantly less initiation than on an RNA template. y-state time courses were performed with 0.1 M nsp12 as described in Figure 6. y-state time courses were performed with 0.1 M nsp12 as described in Figure 6. y-state time courses were performed with 0.1 M nsp12 as described in Figure 6. SARS-CoV nsp12 is a relatively large protein (932-amino-acid residues), e.g. much larger than the well described RdRps of HCV (591 amino acids) and PV (461 amino acids) it remains to be tested whether there is any effect of the C-terminal His-tag on the activity of the enzyme. hepatitis c virus (NS5B) is present in many known de novo initiating RNA polymerases. it functions by partly obstructing the template binding cleft and is believed to be essential for association with the single-stranded 3\u2032 end of the template RNA (23,47,48). nsp12 binds to various other viral replicase subunits (50) and cellular cofactors (51) in vivo. it remains to be tested whether SARS-CoV nsp12 is also active on a longer single-stranded template, e.g. RNA templates based on the terminal sequences of the viral genome. it remains to be tested whether nsp12 is also active on a longer single-stranded template."}
