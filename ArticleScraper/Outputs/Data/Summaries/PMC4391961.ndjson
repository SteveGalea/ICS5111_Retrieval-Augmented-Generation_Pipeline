{"summary": "the impact of infection is often quantified as the cumulative incidence of infection or excess disease burden. it is determined by the transmissibility of the new strain, the seriousness of individual infections, and the degree to which any control measures are effective. a proxy measure of incidence of infection is derived from surveillance data. time-series regression models were used to model influenza-associated excess deaths based on a proxy measure of local influenza activity [1, 2, 4]. weekly type-/subtype-specific influenza activity was estimated by the product of the weekly proportion of outpatients reporting influenza-like illness. the influenza-associated excess mortality rates were calculated by subtracting the predicted mortality rate estimated from a fitted regression model based on the observed weekly influenza activity. the predominant strain in a given season was defined as any specific influenza type/subtype that comprised more than 30% of all laboratory detections of influenza in at least four consecutive weeks during an influenza season. regression model included influenza type/subtype activity as a covariate, lagged by 1 week to allow for a delay between infection and death. pandemic A(H1N1) virus replaced seasonal A(H1N1) virus after mid-2009. we combined seasonal A(H1N1) detections into a single A(H1N1) variable. influenza seasons were defined as time periods of at least two consecutive weeks when the proxy measure of influenza activity exceeded 0005. the predominant strain in a given season was defined as any specific influenza type/subtype that comprised more than 30% of all laboratory detections of influenza in at least four consecutive weeks during an influenza season. sH1N1, Seasonal influenza A(H1N1); sH3N2, seasonal influenza A(H3N2); pH1N1, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. a step change in coefficient for A(H3N2) in 2005 had the lowest AIC. coefficient for influenza virus B was relatively stable over time. sensitivity analyses found very similar results when fitting the model to the elderly (65 years) instead of overall cardio-respiratory death rates, and all-cause mortality rates instead of cardio-respiratory mortality rates. however, we did not observe a step increase in the regression coefficient for H3N2 in 2005. antigenic variant A/California/7/2004(H3N2)-like virus was responsible for a large epidemic in Hong Kong in 2005. it is less likely that this increase could be explained by pneumococcal vaccine because coverage was around 40% in children in 2005\u20132009 and only increased to higher levels after the vaccine was included in the Childhood Immunization Programme in 2009. changes in regression coefficient of A(H1N1) in 2006 and 2009, and A(H3N2) in 2004 were excluded in the present analysis. the changes in regression coefficient of A(H1N1) in 2006 and 2009, and A(H3N2) in 2004 were excluded in the present analysis."}
