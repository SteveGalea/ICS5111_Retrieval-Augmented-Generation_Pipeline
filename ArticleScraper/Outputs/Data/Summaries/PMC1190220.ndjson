{"summary": "the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) posed a great global threat. SARS was found to be caused by a novel coronavirus. the genome of SARS-CoV contains 11 to 14 open reading frames (ORF) and 5 to 8 potential non-structural proteins. pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) or p3b/EGFP-N1 showed a similar pattern of phase distribution in EGFP positive and negative cells transfected with pEGFP-N1 from 24 h to 72 h periods. however, for p3b/EGFP-N1 transfected cells, the phase distribution of positive cells was significantly different from that of negative cells. at 36 h, the increase in G0/G1 phase in positive cells p3b/EGFP-N1 positive and negative cells were gated with forward scatter. the middle and right rows were the assay of cell cycle in p3b/EGFP-N1 positive cells. COS-7 cells were transfected with pEGFP-N1 and p3b/EGFP-N1 separately. at 48 h after transfection, apoptosis analysis was carried out. percentages in apoptosis and necrosis were lower and comparable. in p3b/EGFP-N1 transfected cells (a), the percentage of apoptosis cells increased significantly, compared with negative ones. there were no changes between positive and negative cells transfected with pEGFP-N1 (b)"}
