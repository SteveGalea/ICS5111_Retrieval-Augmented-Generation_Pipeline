{"summary": "METHODS Children's Hospital Colorado has approximately 430 000 outpatient visits, 86 000 emergency department visits, and 4000 inpatient stays each year. the laboratory receives specimens from 5 satellite locations along the Colorado Front Range. specimens from children with respiratory symptoms were collected and sent to the CHCO Clinical Virology Laboratory. xTag Respiratory Virus Panel is able to detect, but not differentiate, between HPIV-4a and HPIV-4b. only patients with specimens positive for HPIV-1\u20134 were excluded. patients with concurrent viral infections (defined as a positive DFA, viral culture, or a positive bacterial culture from a normally sterile site) RESULTS Epidemiology From January 2009 to April 2012, 22 913 specimens were tested. of these, 11 380 specimens were tested by DFA, with 471 (4.1%) positive for HPIV. 65% of samples submitted were positive for at least 1 respiratory virus. patients with HPIV-1\u20134 had similar ages of presentation, sex distribution, daycare attendance rates, and prevalence of underlying medical conditions as patients with HPIV-1\u20133. children with HPIV-4 (61.6%), HPIV-1 (52.0%), and HPIV-2 (51.5%) were less likely to have underlying medical conditions. k) 18 (14.6) 6 (18.2) 13 (21.3) 12 (12.1).44 Asthma 18 (14.6) 7 (21.2) 3 (4.9) 13 (13.1) Pulmonarya 18 (14.6) 9 (27.3) 23 (37.7) 25 (25.3).01 Immunocompromised 11 (8.9) 1 (3.0) 13 (21.3) 11 (11.1).04 Data are presented as No. (%) unless otherwise specified. there were no differences in fever, pharyngitis, vomiting, diarrhea, cough, cough, congestion, or lymphadenopathy among the 4 groups. there were no differences in fever, pharyngitis, vomiting, diarrhea, cough, cough, congestion, or lymphadenopathy among the 4 groups. 0 (0) 0 (0) 3 (4.9) 9 (9.1).01 Lymphadenopathy 5 (4.0) 3 (9.1) 7 (11.5) 5 (5.1) Hypoxia (oxygen saturation 90%) 25 (20.3) 11 (33.3) 31 (50.8) 51 (51.5) patients with HPIV-4 had higher white blood cell counts (11.5\u20131000 cells/L) than patients with HPIV-1 (7.8\u20131000 cells/L), HPIV-2 (9.8\u20131000 cells/L), or HPIV-3 (7.7\u20131000 cells/L) more than half of samples collected were from hospitalized patients. patients with HPIV-4 (19.2%), HPIV-1 (3.3%), and HPIV-3 (16.4%) had lower rates of intubation compared to patients with HPIV-2 (27.3%) (P.01) patients with HPIV-4 (18.2%), HPIV-1 (33.3%), and HPIV-3 (18.0%) were less likely to receive corticosteroids than children with HPIV-2 (54.6%) there were 5 total deaths (1.6%). RVP was performed on 11 533 specimens, of which 752 (6.5%) were positive for HPIV-1\u20134. 65% of samples submitted were positive for at least 1 respiratory virus, including 6.9% that were positive for RSV. children with HPIV-4 (61.6%), HPIV-1 (52.0%), and HPIV-2 (51.5%) were less likely to have underlying medical conditions. there were no differences in underlying prematurity, cardiac conditions, or asthma between the 4 groups. clinical characteristics of patients with human parainfluenza Virus Types 1\u20134 Characteristics of patients with human parainfluenza Virus Types 1\u20134 Characteristics of patients with human parainfluenza. n = 33) HPIV-3 (n = 61) HPIV-4 (n = 99) P Value History and physical exam Fever (>38.0\u00b0C) 103 (83.7) 28 (84.9) 42 (68.9) 73 (73.7) Congestion 85 (69.1) 22 (66.7) 39 (63.9) 69 (69.7).88 Cough 100 (81.3) 24 (72.7) 47 (77.1) 66 (66.7) radiographic findings CXR obtained 53 (43.1) 24 (72.7) 43 (70.5) 68 (68.7).01 Airway disease or atelectasis 28 (22.8) 14 (42.4) 28 (45.9) 43 (43.4) patients with HPIV-4 presented most similar to HPIV-3, with similarly high rates of admission for hypoxia. patients with HPIV-4 (3 days), HPIV-1 (2 days) and HPIV-2 (2 days) had shorter lengths of stay than patients with HPIV-3 (6 days) patients with human parainfluenza Virus Types 1\u20134 Characteristic HPIV-1 (n = 123) HPIV-2 (n = 33) HPIV-3 (n = 61) HPIV-4 (n = 99) P Value Hospital admission 48 (39.0) 27 (81.8) 43 (70.5) 74 (74.8) Median duration of fever, d 2 4 1.5 3.5.17 Discharged home on oxygen 8 (6.5) 8 (24.2) 22 (36.1) 26 (26.3). no patients with HPIV-4 received racemic epinephrine. patients with HPIV-4 (18.2%), HPIV-1 (33.3%), and HPIV-3 (18.0%) were less likely to receive corticosteroids than children with HPIV-2 (54.6%) the rate of viral coinfection with HPIV-4 was high. the number of samples with 3 viruses detected was higher than previous studies have reported. previous studies have reached varying conclusions about its clinical relevance. HPIV-2 has previously been suggested to have biennial, annual, or biannual peaks. previous studies have reported that HPIV-3 tends to peak annually in spring. however, in years when HPIV-1 is low, HPIV-3 may show an extended season or have an additional autumn peak. the low level of HPIV-2 seen in our patient population is consistent with global epidemiologic data. our patients with HPIV-2 had a higher severity of illness than has previously been reported. this may be secondary to viral virulence. clinical presentation and severity of HPIV-4 infections most closely resemble those of HPIV-3 infections. however, HPIV-4 did not have the same predisposition for patients with underlying medical conditions as HPIV-3. supplementary Data supp_209_5_695__index.html (1.2KB, html)."}
