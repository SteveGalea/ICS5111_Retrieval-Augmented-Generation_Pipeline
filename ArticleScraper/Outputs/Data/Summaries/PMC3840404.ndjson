Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals. models for outcomes at day 30 following RSV LRD similarly showed RSV RNA detection as a risk factor for overall mortality and pulmonary death by day 90 following RSV lower respiratory disease. the median number of days was 0 (range 0\u201316), whereas the median number of days was 4 (range, 0\u201324) for patients without RSV RNA detected. overall mortality at day 30 and day 90 following RSV LRD was 39% (n = 46) and 47% (n = 56), respectively. the protective effect of aerosolized ribavirin was also demonstrated in multivariable models determining risk for pulmonary death. the protective effect was also demonstrated in multivariable models determining risk for pulmonary death. mortality by day 30 following respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) LRD showed similar results. abbreviations: BM/CB, bone marrow/cord blood; CI, confidence interval; HR, hazard ratio; LRD, lower respiratory disease; PBSC, peripheral blood stem cell; WBC, white blood cell. current practice guidelines involve treatment with aerosolized ribavirin in all patients with RSV LRD. analysis of shorter-term mortality showed similar results. BM/CB, bone marrow/cord blood; CI, confidence interval; HR, hazard ratio; LRD, lower respiratory disease; PBSC, peripheral blood stem cell; WBC, white blood cell. a significant proportion (30%) of patients with RSV LRD correlated RSV RNA detection with mortality in multivariable models. risk factors for RSV RNA detection in blood included mechanical ventilation, suggesting acute lung injury plays a role in pathogenesis of RSV infection and possibly in dissemination of viral nucleic acid into the bloodstream. ly practical method was performed to maximize detection of viral loads near the limit of detection. patients with duplicate positive samples had higher viral loads. patients with viral loads above the median have increased risk for death compared to patients with viral loads below the median. a pooled analysis by Shah and Chemaly suggested that HCT recipients treated with ribavirin had lower rates of mortality in a review of 21 separate studies. the study is the first analysis of a single cohort to show the protective effect of ribavirin on overall and pulmonary mortality in HCT recipients using multivariable models. lymphopenia has been suggested as a risk factor for progression from URD to LRD. low total WBC count did correlate with increased risk of death in multivariable analyses. monocytopenia correlated with increased death in univariate analysis. fectious Diseases online (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org).
