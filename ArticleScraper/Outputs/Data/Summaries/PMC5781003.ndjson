{"summary": "1, 2, 3 The most common causative pathogen of bacterial CAP is Streptococcus pneumoniae. 4 Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae are among the most common \u2018atypical\u2019 pathogens. infection with a new or progressive infiltrate on a chest radiograph and one of the following criteria: fever (temperature 380\u00b0C) or hypothermia (temperature 35\u00b0C), new cough with or without sputum production, abnormal percussion and altered breath sounds on auscultation, dyspnoea or tachypnea or hypoxia, and leucopenia. KI polyomaviruses (KIPyV and WUPyV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human rhinovirus (HRV), human coronaviruses (HCoV) (OC43, NL63, HKU and 229E), parainfluenza viruses (PIV), 1, 2, 3, 4 influenza viruses A and B (InfA, InfB), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Legionella pneumophila, My a pathogenic microorganism was cultured from blood samples. PCR of the throat swab or sputum samples yielded a positive result. a sputum sample was evaluated by using Gram staining and culture. realtime PCR procedures were performed as described in reference 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22. nucleic acids were extracted from throat swabs with the MagNa pure LC. cDNA was synthesized by using multiScribe reverse transcriptase (RT) and random hexamers. multiScribe RT (50 U/l), 2 l Rnase inhibitor (20 U/l) and 40 l of the isolated sample. RT was carried out for 30 minutes at 48\u00b0C, followed by RT inactivation for 5 minutes at 95\u00b0C. a pathogenic microorganism was cultured from blood samples. male 250 (613) Female 158 (387) Smoking status Smokers 169 (424) Comorbidity \u2013 no.

Coxiella burnetii, causing Q fever, was found in 37 patients. 117 of the 408 patients were positive for one or more viral pathogens. PIVs were the most frequently found viral agents in multiple infected patients. they were found in eight patients [PIV 1 (six times), PIV 2 (one time), PIV 3 (three times)], followed by coronaviruses in seven patients [HKU (one time), OC43 (two times), 229E (one time), NL63 (four times)] and InfB in four patients, InfA in three patients. HCoV OC43 the most detected coronavirus peaked in December 2008. 117 patients were positive for one or more viral pathogens. a bacterial pathogen was detected in 65 (555%) of these 117 patients. ichia coli 3 (0.9%) Human metapneumovirus 1 (0.6%) Human metapneumovirus 3 (0.7%) Other 8 (2.4%) Human rhinovirus 24 (14.7%) Human rhinovirus 19 (4.7%) Pneumococcal urinary antigen test (n = 408) Human coronaviruses Positive 60 (14.7%) OC43 8 (4.9%) OC43 12 (2.9%) Negative 348 (85.3%) NL63 2 (1.2%) NL63 5 ( Coxiella burnetii 17 (3.9%) Pseudomonas aeruginosa 3 (1.5%) Chlamydophila psittaci 4 (2.4%) Chlamydophila pneumoniae 0 Chlamydophila pneumoniae 0 Chlamydophila pneumoniae 2 (0.5%) Escherichia coli 2 (1.0%) Gramnegative bacilli 13 (6.4%) Streptococcus pneumoniae 97 (57.4% HRV was detected three times, PIV1, InfA, HCoV OC43 and RSV were each detected two times. hBoV, KIPyV and hBoV were each detected one time. Legionella was found in 15 patients. HRV was detected at the highest frequency, in 34 (83%) of the 408 patients. detection rates for the other viruses were 56% for InfA, 44% for PIV1, 29% for HCoV OC43, 22% for InfB, 20% for RSV, 15% for HCoV NL63, 12% for PIV3 and HCoV 229E.

Respiratory viruses were found as the only detectable pathogen in 52 patients. colonization is difficult even by quantifying the load. prior antibiotic therapy is of great influence on the growth of S. pneumoniae in sputum samples and blood cultures. in 29% of the patients with CAP, a virus was detected, including 13% of the patients in which only viruses were detected. the authors declare no conflict of interest. infect Dis Clin North Am. 2004;18:761\u2013776, vii.
