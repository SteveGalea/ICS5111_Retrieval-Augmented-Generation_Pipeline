{"summary": "NS3-5B proteins are each essential components of cytoplasmic replication complexes that are responsible for replication of the viral genome. NS5A is considered to be a critical regulator of both viral RNA replication in RCs and infectious virion assembly. but little is known about dynamics of RCs and their NS5A-dependent association with sites of virus assembly. single-membrane vesicles, double-membrane vesicles, and multimembrane vesicles are likely sites of efficient HCV RNA replication. this function of NS5A may be at least partially attributable to its ability to recruit and activate the lipid kinase phosphatidylinositol-kinase III alpha (PI4KIII) to stimulate the local production of phosphatidy newly synthesized NS5A is localized to foci that are smaller than and distinct from those of aged NS5A. for the first time, we have visualized the association of putative RCs with sites of virus assembly in living cells. we suggest weak and transient interactions of HCV core and NS5A proteins may link HCV replication and assembly pathways. siRNAs were purchased from Life Technologies (Silencer Select; catalogue numbers s4202 and 4390846, respectively) Huh-7.5 cells (21) were generously provided by Charles Rice (Rockefeller University, New York, NY) the biarsenical dyes FlAsH-EDT2 and ReAsH-EDT2 were synthesized as described previously. labeling of tetracysteine motif-tagged HCV proteins was performed as described previously. the cells were then washed twice with HBSS/glucose containing 2.8 mM 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanol (Sigma) the cells were then harvested by trypsinization and reseeded into 0.2% gelatin-coated 35-mm coverslip bottom dishes. labeling of SNAP-tagged NS5A with fluorescent SNAP-tag substrates was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. confocal microscopy was performed using a bio-Rad Radiance 2100 confocal system linked to an Olympus IX70 inverted microscope or a Zeiss LSM 700 confocal microscope system. samples were visualized using a 60/1.4NA water immersion objective lens (with a 2 to 3 zoom) images were acquired sequentially for each fluorophore. Statistical analysis was performed by using the Student t test or the Mann-Whitney U-test using Prism 5 (GraphPad Software), with P 0.05 considered statistically significant. pjc1/GFP (18) and pJFH1 (19) were generously provided by Ralf Bartenschlager and Takaji Wakita. details regarding the generation of stable Huh-7.5-derived cell lines are given in the supplemental material. cells were cultured in complete DMEM lacking phenol red. antibodies and chemical inhibitors are detailed in the supplemental material. labeling of TCM-tagged proteins with biarsenical dyes. labeling of tetracysteine motif-tagged HCV proteins was performed as described previously (24), with minor modifications. for each 35-mm dish of cells, 1 l of 1 mM FlAsH (or ReAsH) solution was mixed with 1 l of 25 mM 1,2-ethanedithiol (diluted in DMSO) and then incubated for 10 min at room temperature. labeling of SNAP-tagged NS5A with fluorescent SNAP-tag substrates was performed according to manufacturer's instructions. cells were first cultured on 0.2% gelatin-coated coverslips, fixed with ice-cold acetone-methanol (1:1) for 10 min at 4\u00b0C, permeabilized, blocked, and incubated with primary antibodies. samples were then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)\u20131% wide-field fluorescence microscopy was performed using a plan Apochromat 60 NA 1.4 oil immersion objective lens or a super plan fluor 40 NA 0.4 or plan fluor 10 NA 0.3 objective lens (Nikon) images were acquired sequentially for each fluorophore. to track NS5A localization with minimal disruption of the HCV life cycle, we used complementary fluorescent tagging approaches. first, we inserted an optimized tetracysteine motif (TCM; amino acids FLNCCPGCCMEP) within domain III of NS5A in the infectious HCV chimera Jc1 (25), to generate Jc1/5A-TCM and enable covalent labeling of encoded NS5A-TCM with fluorescent biarsenical dyes Jc1/Core-TCM:5A-GFP[K1402Q] displayed an 1.5-log impairment of infectious virus production compared to untagged Jc1 and delayed spread of infection through Huh-7.5 cell culture (Fig. 1B and C) neither TCM nor GFP insertions in NS5A nor the TCM insertion in core appreciably altered the localization of these proteins. normalized luciferase activity was significantly lower for SGRm-JFH1BlaRL/5A-TCM compared to SGRm-JFH1BlaRL at each time point (P 0.05). we next confirmed specific labeling of TCM-tagged HCV proteins with fluorescent biarsenical dyes. this revealed near-complete overlap between signals associated with FlAsH- and antibody-mediated labeling of NS5A-TCM. at 48 h postelectroporation with Jc1/5A-TCM RNA, Huh-7.5 cells were labeled with FlAsH (green; left panel), fixed, and processed for immunofluorescence with anti-NS5A antibody. images were acquired every 5.3 s for 2 min (see Movie S1 in the supplemental material) the insets depict the traffic of a motile NS5A-GFP structure. image sharpening (using a Gaussian blur filter with a radius of 1.5 pixels), background subtraction, and contrast stretching were applied. NS5A-GFP traffic in living cells during a productive HCV infection. typical motile NS5A-GFP foci display bidirectional traffic at peak velocities of 5 m s1 for runs of 2 m. these results show that in a productive infection TCM-tagged NS5A and core proteins can be specifically labeled with fluorescent biarsenical dyes. these results raise questions as to the mechanisms and purpose of NS5A motility and whether both motile and immotile NS5A foci represent RCs. images were acquired every 7.5 s for 3 min. image sharpening (using a Gaussian blur filter with a radius of 1.5 pixels), background subtraction, and contrast stretching were then applied. scales bars represent 10 and 5 m for main and inset images, respectively. luciferase assays revealed a ca. 40% reduction in normalized replicon-encoded RLuc activity for cells exposed to 100 M ciliobrevin D. luciferase assays revealed a ca. 40% reduction in normalized replicon-encoded RLuc activity for cells exposed to 100 M ciliobrevin D.

Rab5A regulates tethering and homotypic fusion of early endosomes and has been shown to interact with NS4B and influence the formation of sites of HCV RNA replication (35, 36). mCherry-Rab5A proteins in small mCherry-Rab5A-positive structures were excluded from enlarged mCherry-Rab5A(Q79L)-positive endosomes. colocalization of NS5A-GFP with mCherry-Rab5A was significantly lower than that of mCherry-Rab5A (S34N) mCherry-Rab5A cells were electroporated with mCherry-Rab5A, mCherry-Rab5A (S34N) or mCherry-Rab5A (Q79L) expression vectors (at 48 h) and analyzed by live cell imaging (at 72 h), collecting images every 6 s for 3 min. the indicated line scans were used to generate the inset kymographs NS5A-tagged NS5A localized to cytoplasmic foci of various sizes and motilities. but it was not clear whether NS5A-positive foci interacted and exchanged components with one another. this insertion minimally altered infectious HCV production. Huh-7.5 cells were electroporated or electroporated with Jc1 or Jc1/5A-SNAP transcripts and labeled with SNAP-Cell TMR-Star (red) at 3 days, immediately prior to fixation and immunofluorescent labeling of NS5A (green) live cell imaging of Huh-7.5 cells electroporated with Jc1/5A-SNAP transcripts and labeled with fluorescent SNAP-tag ligands. the 8.4-m line scan was used to generate the inset kymograph. NS5A-GFP localized to bright cytoplasmic foci of various sizes and motilities. NS5A-GFP and core-TCM were found in close proximity on core-TCM-capped LD-like structures. NS5A-GFP predominantly remained in distinct foci in contrast to core-TCM. Appel et al. reported a failure to detect core-NS5A interactions in the context of the complete HCV life cycle. Appel et al. reported a failure to detect core-NS5A interactions in the context of the complete HCV life cycle. this suggests that core-NS5A interactions may be unstable, transient, and/or indirect (15) z-sections were acquired and deconvoluted using the 3D AutoQuant Blind Deconvolution plug-in of NIS Elements AR v3.22. images are single representative z-sections. the frequency of PLA signals was significantly higher for uninfected cells. adaptive mutation K1402Q (11) encodes a GFP insertion in domain III of NS5A in Jc1 to generate Jc1/5A-GFP[K1402Q] compared to parent Jc1, incorporation of a TCM within NS5A had no appreciable effect on NS5A processing. incorporation of a TCM within NS5A in a Renilla luciferase (RLuc)-encoding JFH1- Huh-7.5 cells were electroporated with the indicated RLuc-encoding subgenomic replicon transcripts before determination of normalized luciferase activity (RLuc/FLuc) at the indicated time points, expressed as % 3 h (input). the data are means the SEM (n = 4). Huh-7.5 cells were electroporated with Jc1/5A-TCM RNA, cultured, and labeled with FlAsH, before fixation and immunofluorescent labeling of NS5A. this revealed near-complete overlap between signals associated with FlAsH- and antibody-mediated labeling of NS5A-TCM. cells were labeled with ReAsH and an anti-core antibody. at 48 h postelectroporation with Jc1/5A-GFP[K1402Q] RNA, Huh-7.5 cells were labeled with ReAsH (red; top left panel), fixed, and processed for immunofluorescent labeling of core (blue; top middle panel). NS5A-GFP epifluorescence was also captured (green; top right panel). images were acquired every 5.3 s for 2 min. Huh-7.5 cells were electroporated with Jc1/5A-TCM RNA. they were labeled with ReAsH and analyzed by live cell imaging. this labeling strategy was used to minimize background labeling and limit any unanticipated effects of labeling. NS5A traffic is dependent on the host microtubule network and cytoplasmic dynein. to confirm and extend this work, we observed the traffic of motile NS5A-positive structures in close association with -tubulin-RFP-positive microtubules during a productive infection. in close proximity to RFP-labeled microtubules is depicted in the inset images. scales bars represent 10 and 5 m for main and inset images. these treatments induced gross disruption of the microtubule network. the graph depicts the mean velocities of arbitrarily selected NS5A-TCM-positive structures over the course of 3 min. luciferase assays revealed a ca. 40% reduction in normalized replicon-encoded RLuc activity for cells exposed to 100 M ciliobrevin D. luciferase assays revealed a ca. 40% reduction in normalized replicon-encoded RLuc activity for cells exposed to 100 M ciliobrevin D. h-7.5+FLuc cells were coelectroporated with SGRm-JFH1BlaRL RNA (1 g) and either nontargeting or DYNC1H1-specific siRNAs (1 nmol of each) images were acquired every 3 s for 3 min prior to live cell imaging. cytoplasmic dynein plays an important role in long-range traffic of NS5A foci. NS5A colocalizes and cotraffics with proviral host factors. cytoplasmic dynein plays an important role in long-range traffic of NS5A. both relatively static and motile NS5A-positive structures were enriched with mCherry-VAP-A. motile NS5A-positive structures appeared to traffic along VAP-A-positive ER-like membranes. also, motile NS5A-positive structures appeared to traffic along VAP-A-positive ER-like membranes. inset 1 shows enrichment of mCherry-VAP-A in both relatively static and motile NS5A-TCM-positive structures. mCherry-VAP-A cells were electroporated with Jc1/5A-TCM RNA. inset 2 depicts the additional reticular localization of mCherry-VAP-A. h-7.5 cells expressing control- or VAP-A-specific shRNAs were transfected with lentiviral shRNA vectors, antibiotic selection, and enrichment by FACS. NS5A-GFP-positive cells serve as \u201cdonor only\u201d controls. the graph inset displays the mean DIF+SEM for individual NS5A-GFP-positive structures from control (n = 30) and NS5A/VAP-A (n = 33) groups. doxycycline-induced mCherry-Rab5A and mutant derivatives (S34N and Q79L), endogenous Rab5A, and -actin (loading control) mCherry-Rab5A, mCherry-Rab5A (S34N) and mCherry-Rab5A (Q79L) overexpression and GTPase activity on HCV RNA replication. NS5A-GFP extensively cotrafficked with wild-type, GDP-locked (S34N) or GTP-locked (Q79L) mCherry-Rab5A proteins in small m mCherry-Rab5A (Q79L) was significantly lower than that of mCherry-Rab5A (S34N) compared to the wild type, neither average nor peak velocities of NS5A-positive structures were significantly altered by the presence of GDP-/GTP-locked mCherry-Rab5A. however, manual tracking analysis revealed that neither average nor peak velocities of NS5A-positive structures were significantly mCherry-Rab5A (Q79L) expression vectors were analyzed by live cell imaging (at 72 h) the indicated line scans were used to generate the inset kymographs. the indicated line scans were used to generate the inset kymographs. NS5A-SNAP foci were 2-fold larger than their younger counterparts. aged NS5A foci were 2-fold larger than their younger counterparts. NS5A-SNAP ligands were labeled with fluorescent SNAP ligands. NS5A protein encoded by wild-type Jc1 and Jc1/5A-SNAP at 72 h postelectroporation. cells were electroporated with Jc1/5A-SNAP transcripts and labeled with SNAP-Cell 505 at 48 h, blocked (with SNAP-Cell Block), and returned to culture before labeling with SNAP-Cell TMR-Star at 72 h. fluorescently labeled core and NS5A proteins in living cells. NS5A plays a critical role in virus particle assembly. the dynamics of RC association with LDs are completely unknown. NS5A-GFP and core-TCM were found in close proximity on core-TCM-capped LD-like structures. NS5A-GFP predominantly remained in distinct foci in contrast to core-TCM. NS5A-GFP-positive foci were relatively immotile. ization of core-NS5A complexes by in situ proximity ligation assays (PLAs) allows for the detection of weak or transient protein-protein interactions. core-NS5A complexes minimally colocalized with bright NS5A-positive foci. these results confirm the interaction (40-nm proximity) of NS5A with core. the graph inset depicts an enumeration of core-NS5A PLA signals per cell (in central z-sections) in uninfected (n = 73), Jc1-infected (n = 20), and Jc1/5A-GFP[K1402Q]-infected (n = 13) cells. the frequency of PLA signals was significantly higher for Jc1- and Jc1/5A-GFP[K1402Q]-infected a functional microtubule network was dispensable for efficient mouse hepatitis coronavirus replication and virus production (39). both HCV NS3 and NS5A proteins directly interact with microtubules and actin filaments (40), and this may contribute to RC architecture, motility and/or functionality. however, it has been reported that both HCV NS3 and NS5A proteins directly interact with microtubules and actin filaments (40) NS5A motility inhibited the proportion of NS5A foci that displayed long-range motility. it is not clear whether NS5A motility directly contributes to efficient HCV RNA replication or whether disruption of dynein-dependent organellar/vesicular traffic indirectly limits HCV RNA replication. viral RCs must closely associate with sites of virus particle assembly, at least transiently, to enable transfer of progeny viral genomes to virus particle assembly complexe NS5A was detected in clusters at LD-proximal sites. core was more dispersedly embedded in the LD surface. it is important to examine how NS5A-targeted antiviral drugs alter localization. results uncover previously undescribed dynamics of NS5A in a productive HCV infection. they provide a foundation to further dissect mechanisms involved in RC biogenesis, motility, and association with sites of virus assembly for genome transfer and encapsidation."}
