{"summary": "the death rate due to ARI is mostly concentrated in developing regions like africa and Southeast Asia. the definition of ARI includes all infections of the respiratory tract. but a majority of respiratory deaths are attributed to acute lower respiratory infections (ALRIs) ARIs have become a global concern because of the emergence of an increasing number of multi-drug resistant bacteria. lack of information regarding etiological agents influences the use of inappropriate and broad spectrum antibiotics which in turn foster antimicrobial resistance. swabs were collected from enrolled participants by trained medical assistants. sterile cotton flocked swab was soaked in saline and then placed 1 to 1.5 cm into the nostrils. the procedure was repeated using another swab. bacterial pathogens were isolated using selective media including macConkey Agar, Blood Agar with Gentamicin, and chocolate Agar. colonies were identified by specific tests where necessary such as optochin sensitivity and bile solubility tests for Streptococcus pneumoniae. the results of RT-qPCR were considered positive if an exponential fluorescence curve could cross the assigned threshold at Ct40.0. Previously published primers and probes were used for viral pathogen detection by RT-qPCR [12\u201315] the study was conducted in the Institute for Developing Science and Health Initiatives (IDESHI), Dhaka, Bangladesh. a sterile cotton flocked swab was soaked in saline and then placed approximately 1 to 1.5 cm into the nostrils. the procedure was repeated using another swab. bacterial pathogens were isolated using selective media including macConkey Agar, Blood Agar with Gentamicin, and chocolate Agar. colonies were identified by specific tests where necessary such as optochin sensitivity and bile solubility tests. the results of RT-qPCR were considered positive if an exponential fluorescence curve could cross the assigned threshold at Ct40.0. two-tailed chi-square test was performed using http://www.openepi.com/ website to calculate the prevalence of the identified pathogens and coinfection frequencies in different age groups. rate of specimen collection was observed during the months of November, December, and January. Y-axis indicates the number of specimens, whereas X-axis indicates months of the year. after January, there was a gradual decline in specimen collection rate from February (8.5%; n = 17) to May (0%), followed by 2% (n = 4) and 1% (n = 2) collection rates in June and July. 46 bacterial pathogens were isolated from symptomatic children. the most commonly isolated bacteria were S. pneumoniae (18/46; 39%), followed by K. pneumaniae (11/46; 24%), Streptococcus spp. (10/46; 22%), E. agglomerans (4/46; 9%), and H. influenzae (3/46;6%) thromycin, 55% resistance against each of ceftriaxone, cefixime and ciprofloxacin. only carbapenem group of antibiotics including imipenem and meropenem showed 100% sensitivity against K. pneumaniae in vitro. antibiotic resistance patterns for the next predominating ARI agent Streptococcus species (n = 10) were also alarming because there was 30% to 80% resistance frequency for all antibiotics except ceftriaxone. two isolates of S. pneumoniae from asymptomatic ARI participants showed an antibiotic sensitivity pattern similar to that of S. pneumoniae isolates from symptomatic children. the most frequently detected virus was HRV (63/200; 31.5%), followed by HMPV, HBoV, HPIV-3 and adenovirus. bacterial culture positive patients described in Table 4, 17.5% (n = 35) had coinfections with viral pathogens. Table 3. Prevalence of different respiratory pathogens between 1 year and 1\u20135 years age group. 136 (67) 0.0034 1.374 [1.039\u20131.817] 3.123 [1.424\u20136.862] Presence of multiple pathogens 72 (36) 62 (39.5) 10 (23) 0.049 1.698 [0.954\u20133.022] 2.154 [0.991\u20134.682] NA = Not Applicable, Spn = S. pneumoniae, Kpn = K. pneumaniae, Ssp = Streptococcus spp. spp. 1 HPIV-3+ ADV 1 HRV+ HPIV-3+ S. pneumoniae 1 HRV+ HBoV+ HPIV-3 1 HMPV + Streptococcus spp. 1 HPIV-3+ ADV+ RSV 1 S. pneumoniae+ H. influenzae 1 HRV+ RSV+ K. pneumonia+ E. agglomerans 1 HBoV+ HMPV 1 HRV+ HBoV+ HMPV+ HPIV-3 the majority of HMPV (20/26), HBoV (17/22), adenovirus (10/14), HPIV-3 (19/21) and S. pneumoniae (14/18) and K. pneumaniae (8/11) were confined to less than 1 year old children. notably, pathogen detection rates dropped to almost 2% for all viruses for more than three-year old children. over all, the data suggest that under-one children are more likely to receive attention due to their vulnerability to infections by respiratory coinfection partners of adenovirus were mostly confined to viruses including 5 RSV, 4 HRV, 3HPIV-3, 1 influenza A, 1 HMPV, 1 HBoV. among 16 parainfluenza coinfection cases, 15 were HPIV-3 and 1 was HPIV-1. 5 out of 11 HMPV coinfection partners included bacteria like S. pneumoniae and one Streptococcus species. HRV was co-detected in 9 out of 10 K. pneumoniae infection cases. it was co-detected mainly with S. pneumoniae, K. pneumoniae, Streptococcus species, E. agglomerans, and H. influenzae. a total of 20 bacterial isolates had been found with RSV. other than co-detection with bacteria, RSV was also co-detected with adenovirus in 5 specimens, HP the numbers of cases where S. pneumoniae and K. pneumoniae had been found as coinfection partners were 17 (n = 18) and 10 (n = 11), respectively. Fig 3A compares the frequencies of each pathogen identified in single infections and coinfections. adenovirus was the most prevalent pathogen in both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. however, the difference in detection rates of HRV between symptomatic and asymptomatic cases did not generate a significant P-value (P = 0.404) seasonality of viral and bacterial pathogens in terms of hospitalization of ARI patients In Fig 1 we observed seasonal variation in terms of specimen collection rates but not the actual pathogen detection rates. from January to August, HRV circulation was roughly constant, indicating HRV transmission throughout the year. in 4A, Inf A = influenza A, Inf B = influenza B and in 4B, Spn = S. pneumoniae, Kpn = K. pneumaniae, HI = H. influenzae, Eag = E. agglomerans, Ssp = Streptococcus spp. HPIV-3 showed 2 peaks-1 in September and another in November, each representing 6 patients. hospitalization rates of adenovirus-infected patients were 36% ( the rest 6 of the 10 patients infected with Streptococcus species were hospitalized in august (n = 1), October (n = 1), November (n = 1), January (n = 1), and February (n = 2). Interestingly, circulation of all 3 (100%) H. influenzae isolates were confined in September. the rate of specimen collection reached a peak in September (30%; 60/200)) after October, a gradual increase in the rate of specimen collection was observed during the months of November, December, and January. after January, there was a gradual decline in specimen collection rate from February (8.5%; n = 17) to May (0%), followed by 2% (n = 4) and 1% (n = 2) collection rates in June and July. 46 bacterial pathogens were isolated from symptomatic children. the most commonly isolated bacteria were S. pneumoniae (18/46; 39%), followed by K. pneumaniae (11/46; 24%), Streptococcus spp. (10/46; 22%), E. agglomerans (4/46; 9%), and H. influenzae (3/46; 6%). 7% (2 out of 30) nasal swab specimens were culture positive. erythromycin, azithromycin, and cotrimoxazole showed resistance frequencies of 44%, 61%, and 89% respectively. only carbapenem group of antibiotics including imipenem and meropenem had exhibited 100% sensitivity against K. pneumaniae in vitro. Bacterial strains were identified as either sensitive or resistant to an antibiotic based on the diameter of inhibition zone interpretative. one of the K. pneumoniae isolates showed resistance to all available antibiotics including all the first line and second line antibiotics. two multi-drug resistant strains were resistant to an antibiotic based on the diameter of the inhibition zone interpretative, as manifested by CLSI. if in vitro antibiotic resistance patterns match in vivo resistance patterns, it can be concluded that the antibiotic resistance levels have possibly crossed the danger line for K. pneumoniae, Streptococcus species, E. agglomerans, and H. influenzae. among the bacterial culture positive patients described in Table 4, 17.5% (n = 35) coinfections with viral pathogens included influenza A in 3 specimens, Influenza B in 1 specimen and HPIV-1 in 1 specimen. 165 (82.5) 136 (87) 29 (67) 0.0034 1.374 [1.039\u20131.817] 3.123 [1.424\u20136.862] Presence of multiple pathogens 72 (36) 62 (39.5) 10 (23) 0.049 1.698 [0.954\u20133.022] 2.154 [0.991\u20134.682]. pneumoniae 2 ADV+ HBoV+ HPIV-3 1 HRV+ Streptococcus spp. 1 HPIV-3+ ADV 1 HRV+ HBoV+ HPIV-3 1 HMPV + Streptococcus spp. 1 HPIV-3+ ADV+ RSV 1 S. pneumoniae+ H. influenzae 1 HRV+ HBoV+ HBoV+ HPIV-3 1 RSV+ H. influenza 1 Influenza A+ HRV in 1 year age group of children, the detections of HRV (54/63) and RSV (54/62) were almost confined to this age group. however, a significant P value was found in case of RSV (P = 0.0473, RR = 1.167 [1.018\u20131.338], OR = 2.294 [0.995\u20135.29]) only but not for HRV. notably, pathogen detection rates dropped to almost 2% for all viruses for more than three-year old children occus species, E. agglomerans and H. influenza were 94%, 90%, 70%, 75% and 100% respectively. in 72 coinfected cases, 52 showed a pair-wise fashion of co-occurrences of pathogens. in two cases, up to four pathogens were detected in each specimen. the major coinfection viral partners of HRV included RSV (six), HPIV-3 (five) HMPV (four), adenovirus (four), HBoV (three), and Inf A (one) viruses. in addition, HRV was co-detected in 9 out of 10 K. pneumoniae infection cases, whereas it was co-detected in only five S. pneumoniae cases. a total of 20 bacterial isolates had been found with RSV. no significant differences in frequency were observed between single infections and coinfections for each viral agent. the numbers of cases where S. pneumoniae and K. pneumoniae had been found as coinfection partners were 17 (n = 18) and 10 (n = 11) asymptomatic Specimens n = 30 Symptomatic Specimens n = 200 P value HRV 7 (23) 63 (31.5) 0.404 RSV 2 (7) 62 (31) 0.004 HMPV 1 (3) 26 (13) 0.219 ADV 3 (10) 14 (7) 0.471 Spn 2 (7) 18 (9) 1.00 Specimens positive for adenovirus. two isolates of S. pneumoniae were detected in 30 asymptomatic cases. seasonality of viral and bacterial pathogens in terms of hospitalization of ARI patients. the number of RSV-infected patients reached its peak in September. Fig 4A shows the distribution of the detected viruses. in 4A, Inf A = influenza A, Inf B = influenza B and in 4B, Spn = S. pneumoniae, Kpn = K. pneumaniae, HI = H. influenzae, Eag = E. agglomerans, Ssp = Streptococcus spp. the number of second most prevalent bacterial pathogens showed its peak circulation in September, followed by 5 cases (46%) of K. pneumoniae-associated hospitalization in this month. Streptococcus species had a peak circulation in September with 4 (40%) hospitalized patients. antibiogram study was designed to know the condition of antibiotic resistance/sensitivity patterns of major ARI bacterial pathogens to avoid unnecessary use of antibiotics to treat ARI patients. bacterial coinfection, especially superinfection, associates with huge fatal outcomes and deaths of under-five ARI patients. the findings regarding winter seasonality of viral pathogens are thus consistent with previous studies of respiratory viral pathogen detections in Bangladesh. a community-based study conducted in Bangladesh could identify viral and/or bacterial pathogens in only 66% of ARI cases. however, the detection rate was lower than the detection rate calculated for this study. the presence of bacteria as coinfection partners with viruses may complicate clinical symptoms of ARI illness leading to fatal outcomes. our microbiological culture method could detect bacterial pathogens in 21.5% cases, although the majority of bacterial pathogens had been co-detected with viruses. colonization of pathogenic bacteria in airway stimulate topical immune responses [34]. colonization of pathogenic bacteria in airway may play important role in compromising host immune responses. most of the bacteria isolated during the study period fall in either community-acquired or nosocomical categories. single-plex reverse transcription real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) method could detect the presence 213 viruses in 158 (79%) children. the findings corroborate the concept of viruses being the most common causative agent of ARIs and the data are consistent with hospital-based findings in Bangladesh reported by Homaira et al. incidence reached 26% (Laos PDR), 33% (Mexico), 35% (Niger), 37% (Brazil), 51% (Germany), 57% (India), and 76% (Spain) after RSV, HMPV (13%), HBoV (11%) and HPIV-3 (10.5%) came out as the third, fourth, and fifth most prevalent viral agents. around 87% (54/62) of the cases were detected in children less than one year of age. the frequency of RSV infections in this age group seems to be a consequence of multifactorial complex events involving especially immunological factors. a case control study hypothesized that there could have a subclinical infection in asymptomatic cases which may act as a pathogen transmission source. despite differences in methodologies, the similarity in rates of hospitalized viral respiratory illness in different countries suggests that respiratory viruses indeed are important contributors of childhood hospitalization around the world. the nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) has been considered to be the best sampling technique. but the procedure of obtaining an NPA specimen is uncomfortable and often frightening for young children. pathogen detection sensitivity did not differ significantly between nasal swab and NPA approaches of specimen collection."}
