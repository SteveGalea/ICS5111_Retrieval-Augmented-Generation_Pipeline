{"summary": "the first modification tested was stratification by weekdays versus weekend days. a 7-day W2 baseline for weekdays contains the most recent 7 weekdays. the second modification tested was lengthening the baseline period. the test statistic adjusted for total visits was (n0 \u2013 e0)/s0, analogous to the C2 statistic (n0 \u2013 )/st, where and st are the mean and SD of ni, the counts on baseline days. the fourth modification tested was increased minimum value for SD. the mean count for each facility syndrome was calculated and categorized as follows: 0.5 to 2, 2 to 4, 4 to 6, 6 to 8, 8 to 10, 10 to 20, 20 to 40, and >40. no attempt was made to find and exclude real outbreaks from the data. yndrome day, determining whether the observed count plus additional counts is greater than or equal to the threshold value. a single computer run can calculate sensitivity as the percentage of days on which the additional counts would exceed the threshold value. of the 11 syndromes, respiratory visits comprise the highest percentage (16% of total facility\u2013syndrome days) and had the highest mean count (26.0 visits per facility per day) the doD data had a strong day-of-week effect. 16%\u201321% of total weekly visits occurred per day on weekdays. only 3%\u20134% of visits occurred per day on weekend days and holidays. sensitivity was 40.6% for the initial algorithm and increased to 43.9% when the rate method was used; 70.8% when the minimum SD was increased to 1.0; 79.4% when the baseline duration was increased to 28 days; and 82.0% when a stratified baseline was used. the number of additional counts varied according to categories of average count for each facility\u2013syndrome (0.5\u20132, 2\u20134, 4\u20136, 6\u20138, 8\u201310, 10\u201320, 20\u201340, and >40) to produce 40% sensitivity for the initial method. the difference between the initial and best algorithms was highest when sensitivity was 50% for the initial algorithm. sensitivity for detecting 8 additional counts was 47.2% for the initial and 70.9% for the best algorithm. over 632 days, the sensitivity for detecting 8 additional counts was 47.2% for the initial and 70.9% for the best algorithm. sensitivity was improved by using a higher minimum SD of 1.0, a longer baseline duration of 28 days, and adjusting for total visits. the best analytic methods depend on dataset characteristics, especially the day-of-week effect, and could be varied by manual or automated selection. Stratification by weekday versus weekend day improves expected value calculations. longer baseline durations have no effect on the accuracy of expected value calculation. a higher minimum SD avoids nuisance alerts that may be prompted by small fluctuations in the daily visit count. the utility of these systems has not been demonstrated for monitoring small- or intermediate-sized outbreaks or illnesses defined primarily by laboratory testing. the limitations of this study include using only data with a mean count >0.5 per day; analyses of sparser data might show different results. the field of electronic biosurveillance is in its infancy and is rapidly changing. early work focused on attempts to detect outbreaks by using broadly defined syndromes (e.g., respiratory syndrome) based on chief complaints and diagnoses."}
