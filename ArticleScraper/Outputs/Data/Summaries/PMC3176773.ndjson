{"summary": "new methods for pathogen detection and surveillance are usually dependent on prior knowledge of the etiologic agents involved. results show that high throughput sequencing of small RNA is feasible for identifying viral agents in wild-caught mosquitoes. novel viruses, particularly those causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and avian influenza A H5N1, have attracted international concern. these diseases represent only part of a rich tapestry of pathogens that have emerged to pose public health threats in recent years. there is a pressing need for rapid and accurate identification of viral etiological agents. high throughput sequencing techniques provide a powerful new opportunity for surveillance and discovery of novel pathogens. the techniques provide a cost-effective mechanism for massive parallel sequencing generating extreme sequencing depth, whilst providing multiplex analyses for etiologic agent identification. one to two thousand miRNA candidates were predicted using miRNA prediction software. samples Raw reads Mappable reads Known miRNA Predicted miRNA C. pipiens molestus 50,616,662 17,723,487 201 845 A.. sinensis 45,936,670 8,918,988 205 2462 Virus sequence detection. no significant amount of sequence was found that corresponded to any specific virus. a BLAST strategy was proposed in the literature [9] to ensure identification of viruses based on amino acid sequences. s had a peak distribution at 21 nt, while the endogenous siRNA in Drosophila [12], [13] and the total library small RNA in mosquitoes had a peak length of 2122 nt. the viral small RNA +/ strand ratio approximated 71 (3933/548), indicating that these molecules were largely derived from the viral RNA transcripts. the core sequences of the high frequency reads were 20\u201322 nt in length, with 3 or 4 adenosine bases located at the 5\u2032 terminus. the two most frequently occurring sequences were in the coding region of the viral capsid protein gene. the other two medium high copy number sequences were located in the NS1 and NS2 genes. no small RNAs were mapped to the untranscribed regions. the fact that reads mapped to the untranscribed regions were not unexpected. the fact that reads mapped to the untranscribed regions were not unexpected. genome as a whole is roughly 2% different to reference densovirus (EU233812) such high evolutionary conservation suggests that these sequences are of functional importance. a standard PCR was conducted using total DNA extracted from samples of the three mosquito species. the phylogenetic tree obtained infers that newly identified densovirus YN2009 is a close relative of the mosquito densoviruses prevalent in South and Southwest China. the phylogenetic tree was generated using Mega 4.0 with maximum parsimony and bootstrap 500. 3,479 11,781,779 192 2298 C. pipiens molestus 50,616,662 17,723,487 201 845 A.. sinensis 45,936,670 8,918,988 205 2462 Virus sequence detection We performed BLAST analysis (using the blastn program) to identify potential viral sequences in the cleaned unique sequences. small RNA sequence analysis of newly identified virus did not reveal viral sequences in any of the three mosquito samples tested. small RNA reads were assembled using three viral genomes as references. of the three viruses, A. gambiae densonucleosis had the most mapped reads (4481) and the longest assembled consensus sequence (3248 bp) the viral small RNA +/ strand ratio approximated 71 (3933/548) these molecules were largely derived from the viral RNA transcripts. the mechanism for biogenesis of the \u2013 strand small RNAs in mosquitoes is currently unknown. the two most frequently occurring sequences (with greater than 600 coverage) were in the coding region of the viral capsid protein gene. the other two medium high copy number sequences were located in the NS1 and NS2 genes respectively. reads mapped to the untranscribed 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 inverted repeat regions indicate that those inverted repeat regions may be transcribed by an unknown mechanism. transcripts from the stem-loop regions are involved in virus replication (e.g. as primers for genomic DNA synthesis) gel electrophoresis demonstrated that a DNA band of the appropriate size had been amplified in the C. pipiens molestus mosquito sample, but not from C. tritaeniorhynchus or A. sinensis. these results confirm the existence of a densovirus in C. pipiens molestus, but not in C. tritaeniorhynchus and A. sinensis. the phylogenetic tree was generated using Mega 4.0 with maximum parsimony. reference densovirus strains were selected after blasting the NCBI NT database with a 398 bp fragment assembled with the small RNAs. scale bar represents the number of nucleotide substitutions. ed RNA (dsRNA) sequence (and the siRNA mature forms generated from dsRNA) is reasonable to expect that only RNA viruses which contain dsRNA as genomic RNA or replicate via a dsRNA intermediate can be identified using this strategy. underlying mechanism of the biogenesis of these small RNAs is unclear. mosquito populations are the most important vector of WNV, DENV, CHIKV and YFV, and controlling mosquito populations is an important way of preventing epidemics of these life-threatening diseases. densoviruses have been considered as a biological control agents [20], [26], [27], [28], and most densoviruses take 2\u201320 days to kill their insect hosts. small RNA sequencing is able to identify RNA viruses, but also DNA viruses in wild-caught mosquitoes. the densovirus identified here was not a significant etiologic agent. this discovery proves that the approach is applicable not only for discovery of RNA viruses, but also for novel virus discovery. total RNA samples were size-fractionated on a 15% tris-borate-EDTA-urea polyacrylamide gel. RNA fragments 15\u201350 nt long were isolated, quantified, and ethanol precipitated. the ligated RNA fragments were reverse transcribed to single-stranded cDNAs. raw sequencing reads were obtained using the Illumina Pipeline v1.5 software. low-quality reads were removed from the raw reads. all sequences were mapped to miRNA sequences from miRNA database, miRBase 16.0. BLAST results were analyzed manually to screen for potential virus sequences. PCR confirmation of viral infection Total mosquito DNAs were extracted with TRIzol reagent (Introgen, Carlsbad, CA) the samples were stored in liquid nitrogen until RNA extraction. the samples were not privately owned or protected and did not involve endangered or protected species. PCR products were purified on a 12% tris-borate-EDTA polyacrylamide gel. a slice of gel containing cDNAs of 80\u2013115 bp was excised. this fraction was eluted and the recovered cDNAs were quantified. the concentration of the sample was adjusted to 10 nM and 10 L. all sequences were mapped to miRNA sequences from miRNA database miRBase 16.0 (http://www.mirbase.org/) all sequences were mapped to miRNA sequences from the miRNA database, miRBase 16.0 (http://www.mirbase.org/). PCR products were visualized on a 1% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. read alignment is saved in the ace file format and can be viewed with common read alignment program like tablet."}
