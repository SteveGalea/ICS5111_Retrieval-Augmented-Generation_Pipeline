{"summary": "study aims to explore risk perception and other factors associated with handwashing and wearing face masks to prevent AI. 520 cases of avian influenza (AI) had been reported around the world, resulting in 307 deaths, with a case fatality rate of 59.0%. human-to-human transmissions may begin to take place if there is a change in the viral genome. in Taiwan, people have the habit of shopping at traditional markets for live poultry [10], and such traditional markets with live chicken for sale provide a possible AI viral reservoir [11], thereby exposing shoppers to risk of contracting AI. handwashing and wearing face masks have been documented as effective preventive measures against respiratory disease in community settings. both handwashing and wearing face masks could be a cost-effective way of preventing AI in the general public. the current study aimed to estimate the prevalence of the recommended AI preventive behavior among traditional market workers and shoppers in northeastern and northeastern Taiwan. the current study aimed to explore the risk perception of the recommended AI preventive behavior among traditional market workers and shoppers in central and northeastern Taiwan. the study protocol and verbal consent procedure were reviewed and approved by the National Taiwan University College of Public Health. participants were first approached and informed of the study's goals and procedures. each attempt made to approach potential participants, whether it was successful or unsuccessful, was documented in order to calculate the response rate. the outcome measure of recommended AI preventive behavior was assessed by asking: \"When you are in a traditional market, do you wear a face mask and also wash your hands after any contact with poultry (yes/no)\" only participants who were wearing a face mask at the time of the interview would be coded as adopting the recommended AI preventive behavior as defined in this study. study aimed to explore the risk perception of AI among traditional market workers and shoppers in central and northeastern Taiwan. two traditional markets were selected in central and northeastern Taiwan, while two others were selected in northeastern Taiwan. purposive sampling was employed in traditional markets. the AI risk classification above takes into account the nearness in space to live poultry. pork vendors, beef vendors, etc. are classified as medium risk market workers. flower vendors and vegetable vendors are classified as low risk market workers. sociodemographic variables, knowledge, and risk perception of AI were cross-tabulated with AI preventive behavior. 2 comparisons were performed to test for group differences between participants who practiced the recommended AI preventive behavior and those who did not. the final model was adjusted for age and gender as control variables. participants with a university or higher degree (70.3%) were the most likely to adopt the recommended AI preventive behavior. participants with a senior high-school diploma (68.8% vs. 39.8%, 2 = 23.16, df = 1, p.0001) were more likely to practice the recommended AI preventive behavior. male 75 (56.8) 57 (43.2) Female 110 (50.0) 110 (50.0) Region of residence 23.19 (1).0001 Northeastern Taiwan 53 (37.1) 90 (62.9) Central Taiwan 132 (63.2) 77 (36.8) Education 37.71 (2).0001 Junior high-school or below 99 (69.2) 44 (30.8) Senior high-school 67 (46.2) 78 (53.8) University or above 19 (29.7) 45 (70.3) Market worker 0.72 (1).40 Yes participants who lived in northeastern Taiwan were 6 times as likely as those in central Taiwan to practice the recommended AI preventive behavior. male gender was found to interact with senior high-school education. females with a senior high-school diploma were more than 3 times as likely (AOR = 3.33, 95% CI = 1.56\u20137.07) the mean age was 43.9 years; 62.5% were female; 59.4% lived in central Taiwan; 18.2% had a degree from university or above; 41.2% had a senior high-school diploma. about half (49.7%) of the participants were shoppers; 22.7%, 18.2%, and 9.4% were market workers at low, medium, and high risk for AI. participants with a university or higher degree (70.3%) were the most likely to adopt the recommended AI preventive behavior. participants with a senior high-school diploma (68.8% vs. 39.8%, 2 = 23.16, df = 1, p.0001) were more likely to practice the recommended AI preventive behavior. 110 (50.0) Region of residence 23.19 (1).0001 Northeastern Taiwan 53 (37.1) 90 (62.9) Central Taiwan 132 (63.2) 77 (36.8) Education 37.71 (2).0001 Junior high-school or below 99 (69.2) 44 (30.8) Senior high-school 67 (46.2) 78 (53.8) University or above 19 (29.7) 45 (70.3) Market worker 0.72 (1).40 Yes 97 (54.8) 80 (45.2) No 88 (50.3) 87 ( participants who lived in northeastern Taiwan were 6 times as likely as those in central Taiwan to practice the recommended AI preventive behavior. male gender was found to interact with senior high-school education. females with a senior high-school diploma were more than 3 times as likely (AOR = 3.33, 95% CI = 1.56\u20137.07) knowledge about AI fatality rate Correct 4.18 2.25\u20137.75 Incorrect 1.00b Knew about AI outbreaks in Kaohsiung Yes 2.24 1.28\u20133.92 No 1.00b Senior high-school education by male genderc 0.34 0.12\u20130.98 a AI, avian influenza;
