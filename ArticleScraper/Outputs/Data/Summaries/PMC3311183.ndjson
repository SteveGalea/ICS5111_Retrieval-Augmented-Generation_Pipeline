{"summary": "interviewers approached 132 licensed live-poultry retail businesses. the final sample was 360 poultry workers (194 retailers and 166 wholesalers; response rate 68.1%). ninety-six (27.4%) workers were unsure whether avian influenza virus (H5N1) infection had occurred in humans in Hong Kong. 198 (58%) incorrectly believed that nearly everyone survives this infection. 110 (2.8%) incorrectly believed that a human vaccine for avian influenza was available. poultry workers in Hong Kong showed low risk perceptions for avian influenza, inadequate knowledge, and a wide range of compliance with preventive measures. only 129 (42.1%) respondents reported that poultry workers could realistically adhere to all government guidelines. the fight against global pandemics, such as those of avian influenza virus (H5N1), necessitates greater dialogue and collaborative leadership."}
