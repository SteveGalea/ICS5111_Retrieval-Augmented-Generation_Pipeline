{"summary": "digital array is a novel nanofluidic biochip [2], [3] where digital PCR reactions can be performed by partitioning DNA molecules, instead of diluting them. the chip is then thermocycled and imaged on Fluidigm's bioMark real-time PCR system. the positive chambers that originally contained 1 or more molecules can be counted by the digital array analysis software. whole genome studies have revealed the presence of large numbers of CNV regions in human and a broad range of genetic diversity among the general population. current whole-genome scanning technologies use array-based platforms (array-CGH and high-density SNP microarrays) to study CNVs. they are high throughput but lack resolution and sensitivity. our approach is built on well-known tools and techniques from statistics. it decomposes the problem into two parts. it turns out that the first question can be answered by applying sampling and estimation theories from statistics and probability. a digital array has 12 panels of 765 reaction chambers each. PCR mixes are loaded into each panel and single DNA molecules are randomly partitioned into the chambers. the digital array can be thermocycled, imaged on a biomark instrument. digital PCR analysis software can count the number of positive chambers in each panel. when two assays with two fluorescent dyes are used in a multiplex digital PCR reaction, two genes can be independently quantitated. this is the basis of the study using the digital array. derived a mathematical framework to calculate the true concentration of molecules from the observed positive reactions in a digital array panel. we also show how to perform statistical analysis to find the 95% confidence intervals of the true concentrations and the ratio of two concentrations. this paper differs from this prior work by Warren et al. in two different ways. first, we consider the parameter to be a fixed constant. second, in addition to providing the answer to the first question, we are interested in estimating the confidence interval of the ratio of two concentrations. p is an unknown population parameter. we will use the standard hat notation to denote sample estimators of population parameters. for example, p and will denote the estimators of p and, respectively, the number of molecules in each chamber as a Poisson process. it is referred to as binomial sign test when the test statistic can be approximated with the chi-square distribution, specifically through the use of the chi-square goodness-of-fit. an alternative and equivalent approximation is obtained by using the normal distribution and then the test is called the population proportion test. f(p) has very small due to very large number of chambers. higher order terms for all n>0 in the Taylor expansion are small. the only contributing term is when n = 0, which implies As C, approaches the true concentration of molecules. the green curve is the sampling distribution predicted by the theory. compared the metrics of histogram, shown in Figure 5, of number of positive chambers obtained in simulation with those predicted by the theory. a confidence ellipse in the two-dimensional plane can be constructed. consider the two lines which pass through the origin and the 2-D point. the intersection of these lines with the vertical line gives the desired confidence interval. a numerical projection algorithm computes the sampling distribution of ratio of two random variables with arbitrary probability distributions. most of the contribution would come from the confidence ellipse region. one can still use direct formulas, as an approximation, to compute confidence interval as follows. p 1,Low = p 11.96S 1, p 1,High = p 1+1.96S 1 p 2,Low = p 21.96S 2, p 2,High = p 2+1.96S 2,,,,,,,, and rHigh = p 2+1.96S 2. rHigh = p 1+1.96S 1 p 2,Low = p 21.96S 2, p 2,High = p 2+1.96S 2. there is significant overlap between 95% confidence intervals of certain ratios. there is no overlap when 3 or more panels are used. the known ratio lies within the computed 95% confidence interval. it is well known that p is an unbiased estimator of p and has expectation p and standard deviation and its sampling distribution f(p) is approximately normal for large C. a digital array panel is a finite sampling of this universe. expectation of estimation of Let a random variable X have probability density function fX(x) If h(x) is either increasing or decreasing in x, then U = h(X) has density function given by which follows from the fact that probabilities in any given differential area have to be invariant under change of variables, see [16]. for each of the panels, compute as an estimator of p and plot its histogram over all the K panels. the true value of should lie within the confidence interval. in 95% of the panels, the true value of should lie within the confidence interval. the goal is to determine ratio of true concentrations of two genes, one being reference gene and the other being test gene, and associated confidence interval. if these distributions were normal, then one can make use of Fieller's Theorem [18], [19] but, as mentioned earlier, one can not make this assumption in general. it is easy to see from the proof of Fieller's theorem and its geometric interpretation that one can compute sampling distribution q of the ratio estimator as follows. this can be interpreted as cutting out thin wedges in the joint distribution of and accumulating the probabilities inside the wedge to compute the function q. the confidence region is made of union of four quadrant-wise elliptic regions. the asymmetric confidence intervals for specified zc and the two concentrations are [, ] and [, ] and [, ]. using simple algebraic manipulations, it can be shown, as in symmetric case, that slopes of lines that will be tangents to this union of four quadrant-wise ellipses will be. simulation results on Estimation of Ratio We conducted simulation studies using a random number generator and a computer program. in 94.9% of the panels, the true chosen ratio did lie in the computed confidence intervals thereby showing the correctness of our mathematical analysis. the solution is an elegant application of statistical sampling and estimation theories to such an important real-world problem. we have shown how one can compute the ratio of true concentrations of multiple sequences and the associated confidence interval on this estimation. a 10-l reaction mix is normally prepared for each panel. the primers and probe were ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) both RPP30 synthetic construct and human genomic DNA NA10860 were quantitated using the RPP30 assay on a digital array. different amounts of RPP30 synthetic construct was then added into the genomic DNA so that mixtures with ratios of RPP30 to RNase P of 11 (no spike-in)"}
