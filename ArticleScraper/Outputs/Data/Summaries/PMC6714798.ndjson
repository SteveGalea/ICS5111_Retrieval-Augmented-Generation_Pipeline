{"summary": "multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory neurodegenerative disease characterized by multifocal regions of central nervous system (CNS) neuroinflammation, demyelination, and axonal loss. preclinical animal models indicate that CNS infiltration of neutrophils, monocyte/macrophages, and inflammatory T cells is important in disease initiation and maintaining demyelination. mice devoid of CXCR2 exhibit a paucity of OPCs and structural misalignments that persist into adulthood of the mouse. either genetic deletion or antibody-mediated targeting of CXCR2 increases myelin synthesis in demyelinated cerebellum slice cultures. the increase in white matter damage in anti-CXCR2-treated mice was associated with oligodendroglia apoptosis. the study was undertaken to better understand how selective deletion of Cxcr2 within oligodendroglia lineage cells in adult mice influences host defense and disease. ablation of Cxcr2 confirmed in oligodendrocyte lineage cells following ex vivo culture of oligodendroglia generated from the brains of postnatal day 1 (P1) Cxcr2-CKO mice. addition of (Z)-4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT; 100 nM) induced Cre-mediated recombination at the Cxcr2 locus. treatment of cultured oligodendroglia with 4-OHT resulted in expression of tdTomato in >90% of oligodendrocytes derived from P1 Cxcr2-CKO mice. tamoxifen treatment results in enriched tdTomato red expression in spinal cord oligodendroglia. the majority of tdTomato-positive cells in tamoxifen-treated Cxcr2-CKO mice were oligodendroglia, as defined by staining either oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2 (Olig2) (50, 51) or glutathione S-transferase (GST-), a marker of mature oligodendrocytes (52, 53) in tamoxifen-treated mice, 82% of tdTomato-positive cells present within the spinal cords of tamoxifen-treated mice most likely represent oligodendroglia cellular processes. tdTomato-positive cells present within the spinal cords of tamoxifen-treated mice (24%) most likely represent oligodendroglia cellular processes extending from the cell bodies in which neither Olig2 or GST- is detected. no defects in myelin formation/synthesis following Cxcr2 ablation in oligodendroglia. tamoxifen-mediated targeting of Cxcr2 in adult mice affected myelin integrity. in all experimental groups, the g ratios averaged 0.8, indicating normal myelinated axons in the spinal cord. these findings argue that inducible deletion of CXCR2 in oligodendroglia lineage cells in young (4-week-old) mice does not affect the myelin content in a nondisease state. intracranial (i.c.) instillation of the neuroadapted strain of mouse hepatitis virus results in acute encephalomyelitis followed by a chronic demyelinating disease characterized by viral persistence in white matter tracts. tamoxifen- or vehicle-treated Cxcr2-CKO mice were infected i.c. with JHMV (250 PFU), and clinical disease was monitored. topes M133-144 and S510-518 were detected within the brains of the experimental mice at day 7 p.i. there were no differences in either total T cell subsets, neutrophils (CD11b+ Ly6G+) or macrophages (CD45hi F4/80hi) at day 7 p.i. between vehicle- and tamoxifen-treated Cxcr2-CKO mice. flow cytometric data were derived from 2 independent experiments with a minimum of 3 mice per group for each experiment. RNA analysis revealed no changes in proinflammatory gene expression within the brains of the experimental groups at day 7 p.i. Flow cytometric data revealed no differences in spinal cord infiltration of T cells (CD4+ and CD8+ subsets) or macrophages (CD45lo F4/80+) at either day 21 p.i. (D) or day 28 p.i. (H) Flow cytometric data revealed no differences in spinal cord infiltration of T cells (CD4+ and CD8+ subsets) remyelination is enhanced upon silencing of CXCR2 in oligodendroglia. previous work has indicated that targeting of CXCR2 signals through either administration of receptor-specific small molecules (58) or genetic targeting (25) results in increased remyelination. tamoxifen-induced ablation of Cxcr2 on oligodendroglia resulted in increased remyelination. tamoxifen-treated Cxcr2-CKO mice showed a significant increase in myelin thickness in oligodendroglia. remyelination is increased following the ablation of Cxcr2 in oligodendroglia. in tamoxifen-treated mice, remyelinated axons were present. tamoxifen-treated Cxcr2-CKO mice (0.78 0.006, n = 5 mice; 493 axons randomly selected from a total of 34 fields) indicates a significant (P 0.05) reduction in the g ratios in tamoxifen-treated mice compared to the vehicle-treated controls. Cxcr2 ablation increases the numbers of mature oligodendrocytes in tamoxifen-treated mice compared to the controls. these findings argue that targeted ablation of Cxcr2 within oligodendrocytes increases the numbers of mature oligodendrocytes. this correlates with a diminished pool of OPCs and an increase in remyelination. the proteolipid protein (PLP) regulatory element promotes expression of Cre-ER(T) (42) and has previously been shown to accurately reflect endogenous PLP expression. ablation of Cxcr2 was confirmed within oligodendrocyte lineage cells following ex vivo culture of oligodendroglia generated from the brains of postnatal day 1 (P1) Cxcr2-CKO mice. recombination at the Cxcr2 locus was detected by PCR from oligodendroglia-enriched cultures derived from postnatal day 1 (P1) Cxcr2-CKO mice following addition of 100 nM (Z)-4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT). gDNA, genomic DNA. in response to tamoxifen treatment, there was a dramatic increase in tdTomato expression that was distributed throughout the cell body. in tamoxifen-treated mice, 82% of tdTomato-positive cells expressed nuclear-specific markers. MAP2-positive neurons accounted for 4% of tdTomato-positive cells (3.3% 0.8%) in tamoxifen-treated Cxcr2-CKO mice. tamoxifen treatment did not modulate CXCR2 expression in neutrophils. no differences were observed in surface expression of CXCR2 on splenic neutrophils. tamoxifen-induced targeting of Cxcr2 is highly specific to oligodendrocyte lineage cells. tamoxifen-treated Cxcr2-CKO mice were treated twice daily with either 1 mg tamoxifen or vehicle, followed by resting for 2 weeks. tamoxifen-treated Cxcr2-CKO mice were treated twice daily with either 1 mg tamoxifen or vehicle, followed by resting for 2 weeks. assessment of the g ratio is commonly employed as a structural index of myelin. we did not detect any changes in qualitative differences in myelin thickness between naive tamoxifen-treated Cxcr2-CKO mice and vehicle-treated Cxcr2-CKO mice. g ratios averaged 0.8, indicating normal myelinated axons in the spinal cord. the data were derived from two independent experiments with 2 to 4 mice per group. tamoxifen-treated Cxcr2-CKO mice had worse (P 0.05) clinical disease at 12 days postinfection. by day 21 p.i., virus was not detected in the brains of experimental mice. there were no differences in viral titers in the spinal cords of experimental mice. a similar frequency of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells specific for the immunodominant viral epitopes were detected within the brains of the experimental mice at day 7 p.i. Cxcr2-CKO mice were treated with either tamoxifen (n = 22) or vehicle (n = 10), rested for 2 weeks, and infected i.c. with 250 PFU of JHMV. no differences in disease severity or mortality out to day 28 p.i. between the experimental groups. evaluation of demyelination in vehicle- and tamoxifen-treated Cxcr2-CKO mice revealed no differences in the severity of demyelination. findings argue that tamoxifen-mediated targeting of Cxcr2 within oligodendroglia does not alter immune cell infiltration into the spinal cords of JHMV-infected mice. Flow cytometric data revealed no differences in spinal cord infiltration of T cells (CD4+ and CD8+ subsets) or macrophages (CD45hi F4/80+) at either day 21 p.i. (D) or day 28 p.i. (H) the data were derived from two independent experiments with 2 to 3 mice per group. in vehicle-treated Cxcr2-CKO mice, there was an overall increase of demyelinated axons and fewer remyelinated axons compared to tamoxifen-treated Cxcr2-CKO mice. to more accurately quantitate these differences, we quantified both the g ratio and the myelin thickness in infected mice. tamoxifen-induced ablation of Cxcr2 on oli analysis was performed in ventral and lateral white matter columns of spinal cords isolated from experimental mice. g ratios of individual axons from vehicle- and tamoxifen-treated mice as a function of axonal diameter. mediated targeting of Cxcr2 within oligodendroglia led to increase in remyelination, we stained for NG2 and GST-. this is normally associated with mature myelin-producing oligodendrocytes in the spinal cords of experimental mice. tamoxifen-treated mice were sacrificed and the spinal cords were removed. chemokine signaling networks that are associated with chronic CNS diseases are thought to amplify disease severity by attracting targeted populations of leukocytes into the CNS. chemokine pathway that is emerging as important in chronic CNS disease involves the CXCR2 receptor and its cognate ELR-positive chemokine ligands CXCL1, -2, and -3 and CXCL5, -6, -7, and -8. addition of IFN- to cultured OPCs derived from mouse neural progenitor cells results in apoptosis, while inclusion of the CXCL1 protein blocks OPC apoptotic death (14). CXCR2 also influences OPC proliferation and differentiation (21) and controls the migration of spinal cord OPCs during development (22) induced expression of CXCL1 resulted in increased demyelination mediated by neutrophils. blocking signaling in mice increases severity of demyelination, arguing for a protective role for CXCR2 in a model of virus-induced demyelination. anti-CXCR2 treatment of mice altered signaling responses on other CXCR2-positive mice. our present study used a more incisive genetic model to further our understanding of how CXCR2 signaling on oligodendrocytes affects neurologic disease in a preclinical animal model of MS. our findings indicate that targeted deletion of Cxcr2 occurs in oligodendrocytes both in vitro and in vivo. expression of proinflammatory genes within the CNS was not impacted in response to tamoxifen-mediated silencing of Cxcr2 on oligodendrocytes. we did not detect differences in the severity of demyelination in tamoxifen-treated Cxcr2-CKO mice from that in the controls. we observed increased numbers of mature GST- oligodendrocytes along with reduced numbers of NG2-positive cells representing OPCs authors showed enhanced remyelination in mice in which CXCR2 signaling in oligodendrocytes was inhibited. remyelination is observed in both toxin and viral models of demyelination. remyelination is observed in both toxin and viral models of demyelination. four-week-old Cxcr2-CKO mice received either 1 mg/ml tamoxifen or vehicle (control) twice daily for 5 days via intraperitoneal injection, rested for 2 weeks, and infected intracranially with JHMV (43, 44). viral titer analysis: one half of each brain or whole spinal cord was homogenized and used in a plaque assay as previously described (19, 67). oligodendroglia were transferred to a 1-ml conical tube and centrifuged at 300 g for 5 min. cells were counted and plated onto Nunc Lab-Tek II chamber slides. cells were cultured for an additional 6 days. 11b (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), and Ly6C (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) flow cytometric gating strategies were employed for following inflammatory cells isolated from the CNS. neutrophils (CD45hi CD11b+ Ly6G+), monocytes (CD45hi CD11b+ Ly6C+ Ly6G+), macrophages (CD45hi CD11b+ F4/80+), and microglia (CD45 cl19, Ccl2, Ccl20, Ccl22, Ccl24, Ccl3, Ccl4, Ccl5, Ccl7, Cx3cl1, Cxcl1, Cxcl10, Cxcl11, Cxcl12, Cxcl13, Cxcl16, Cxcl3, Cxcl5, Cxcl9, Pf4, Ppbp, and Xcl1 mice were euthanized at defined times points according to approved IACUC protocol no.16-09008. length of spinal cord extending from thoracic vertebrae 6 to 10 was cryoprotected in 30% sucrose, cut into 1-mm transverse blocks, processed so as to preserve craniocaudal orientation. the slides were deidentified and read independently by two investigators. spinal cords (ranging from thoracic vertebrae 6 to 10) were removed from experimental mice at defined times p.i. spinal cords from tamoxifen-treated mice were used to detect cells dual positive for tdTomato and cellular markers for neurons (MAP2), macrophage/microglia (IBA1), or oligodendroglia (Olig2 and GST-) mice were sacrificed and underwent cardiac perfusion with 0.1 M cacodylate buffer containing 2% paraformaldehyde\u20132.5% glutaraldehyde. a total of 297 axons were counted (n = 4 mice) from a total of 25 randomly selected fields. tamoxifen-treated mice received either 1 mg/ml tamoxifen or vehicle (control) twice daily for 5 days via intraperitoneal injection, rested for 2 weeks. age-matched 5- to 6-week-old Cxcr2-CKO mice were infected i.c. with 250 PFU of JHMV in 30 l of sterile Hanks balanced salt solution. sham-infected animals received 30 l HBSS via i.c. injection. cells were counted and plated onto Nunc Lab-Tek II chamber slides. cells were enriched via a 2-step Percoll cushion (90% and 63%) cells were incubated with anti-CD16/32 Fc block (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated rat anti-mouse CD4 and a phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated tetramer specific for the CD4 immunodominant epitope present within the JHMV matrix (M) glycoprotein spanning amino acids 133 to 147 (the M133\u2013147 tetramer) were used to determine total and virus-specific CD4+ cells. ukin/cytokine genes Il10, Il11, Il12a, Il12b, Il13, Il15, Il16, Il17a, Il17f, Il18, Il1a, Il1a, Il1b, Il1rn, Il21, Il23a, Il24, Il27, Il3, Il4, Il5, Il6, Il7, Il9, Adipoq (Acrp30), Ctf1, Hc, Mif, Spp1, Tgf eight-micrometer-thick coronal sections were cut, sections were stained with hematoxylin/eosin (H&E) and between 4 and 8 sections per mouse were analyzed. oligodendroglia cells were fixed for 20 min in 4% paraformaldehyde before being blocked with species-appropriate serum. rabbit anti-NG2 (1:500 dilution; millipore Corp., Temecula, CA), rabbit anti-MAP2 (1:200 dilution; millipore Corp., Temecula, CA), mouse anti-MAP2 (1:200 dilution; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) were used to stain the slides overnight at 4\u00b0C, the slides were then washed in PBS, and appropriate secondary fluorescently conjugated antibodies were used for experimental mice were sacrificed and underwent cardiac perfusion with 0.1 M cacodylate buffer containing 2% paraformaldehyde\u20132.5% glutaraldehyde. images at 1,200 magnification were analyzed for the g ratio and myelin sheath thickness. a log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test was used for survival curve analysis. comparisons of two groups were analyzed by two-tailed Student\u2019s t tests."}
