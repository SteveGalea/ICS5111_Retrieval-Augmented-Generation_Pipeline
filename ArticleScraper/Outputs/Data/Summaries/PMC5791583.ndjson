{"summary": "pneumococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is the major global etiological cause of pneumonia and accounts for 36% of overall childhood pneumonia. pneumococcus has become the leading cause of bacterial meningitis among children aged 5 years or below. more than 90% of pneumonia-related deaths in children under the age of 5 years occur in 40 countries, with the highest mortality rates in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan. the estimated annual number of cases was 250 for meningitis, 250,000 for pneumonia, and 2.5 million for AOM in Turkey. median (Q1-Q3) age was 29.10 months (13.43\u201343.67 months) median (Q1-Q3) values of direct costs and indirect costs were \u20ac3,346.38 (\u20ac941.82\u2013\u20ac11,700.86) and \u20ac829.18 (\u20ac483.65\u2013\u20ac3,255.39), respectively, for pneumococcal meningitis, \u20ac480.66 (\u20ac202.36\u2013\u20ac891.13) and \u20ac330.09 (\u20ac214.91\u2013\u20ac 156.53 1,270.62 2,848.92 0.056 NA NA \u2014 Median (Q1-Q3) 217.77 (175.60\u2013348.18) 438.28 (181.09\u2013999.65) Medication cost Mean SD 81.74 78.69 496.1 1,454.83 0.047 NA NA \u2014 Median (Q1-Q3) 53.11 (30.29\u201397.02) 113.66 (36.67\u2013388.87) Material cost Mean Pneumococcal Meningitis n = 10 Pneumonia n = 53 Acute Otitis Media n = 67 Direct costs, \u20ac Mean SD 9,299.98 13,762.01 1,317.76 3,179.1 20.57 7.64 Median (Q1-Q3) 3,346.38 (941.82\u201311,700.86) 480.66 (202.36\u2013891.13) 17.59 (17.59\u201317.59) Service cost Mean SD 6,88 median (Q1-Q3) values for direct and indirect costs were \u20ac351.33 (\u20ac197.24\u2013\u20ac505.41) and \u20ac441.31 (\u20ac406.89\u2013\u20ac475.73) for one patient who developed hearing loss as complication of AOM, the direct and indirect costs were \u20ac32.41 and \u20ac310,411.89, respectively. the total economic burden of pneumococcal infections in, excluding bacteremia, is therefore approximately 500 million Euros. AOM was significantly higher in the patients aged 36 months than those aged 36 months (p = 0.049) comparison of costs between genders revealed no difference between the groups. pneumococcal meningitis ranks fifth among the first 20 diseases causing death by 2.7% in 0\u201314 year age group in turkey. pneumococcal meningitis ranks fifth among the first 20 diseases causing death by 2.7% in 0\u201314 year age group. among pneumococcal infections, the highest total cost was estimated for the treatment of pneumococcal meningitis by \u20ac4,060.38 per patient. among pneumococcal infections, the highest total cost was estimated for the treatment of pneumococcal meningitis by \u20ac4,060.38 per patient. in southern Israel, sequential implementation of PCV7 and PCV13 was associated with decreases in otitis media caused by PCV7 serotypes plus serotype 6A and then by 5 additional PCV13 serotypes (5VT: 1, 3, 5, 7F, 19A) by 96% and 85% in the respective periods. the present study has also some limitations. direct costs for hospitalized patients with meningitis due to S. pneumoniae and with pneumonia included the costs of healthcare services, medications, and materials. data regarding costs of healthcare services were obtained from Hacettepe University Hospital, which uses the unit prices indicated in the national health practices statement. daily earnings determined to be \u20ac23.23 (\u20ac774.14 0.90/30 days) for fathers and \u20ac10.58 [(\u20ac774.14 0.41)/30 days] for mothers. fathers assumed to have one day of work loss per week over the course of a child's hospital stay. Mann-Whitney U test was used for non-normally distributed numerical variables. a p value 0.05 was considered statistically significant."}
