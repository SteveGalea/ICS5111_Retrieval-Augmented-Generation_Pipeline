{"summary": "the viral genomes of the Picornavirales order are characterized by a set of highly conserved genes, including an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) for viral RNA replication, a chymotrypsin-like 3C protease for proteolytic processing of picornaviral polyproteins into separate proteins. nonstructural protein 2C is one of the most conserved proteins within the Picornavirales order and has long been predicted to be a picornaviral 2C proteins are also involved in RNA binding (17), membrane anchoring (18, 19), intracellular membrane rearrangements (20), encapsidation and viral morphogenesis (15, 16), and autophagy inhibition (21). RNA helicases are highly similar to DNA helicases, contain ATPase activity, and use the energy provided by ATP hydrolysis to melt base pairs. RNA chaperones are the proteins that accelerate annealing of cRNA strands. annealers are the proteins that accelerate annealing of cRNA strands. many RNA viruses encode their own RNA helicases and/or chaperones. Iflaviridae is the family closest to Picornaviridae within Picornavirales. the two families share features of N-terminal structural proteins and the conserved C-terminal nonstructural 2CATPase-3CPro-3DPol module. iflaviridae comprises other insect picorna-like viruses. characterization of EoV 2C revealed that divalent metal ions, such as Mg2+ and Zn2+, inhibit 2C-mediated helix destabilization to different extents. we also determined that EoV 2C also contains ATPase activity similar to that of other picornaviral 2C proteins. the resulting plasmids were subjected to the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system to express the fusion proteins with an MBP tag at the N terminus of the EoV helicase domain (MBP-2C) the resulting plasmids were subjected to the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system to express the fusion proteins with an MBP tag. nucleotides substituted for mutagenesis are shown with lowercase characters. expression and purification of recombinant proteins were performed as previously described. unlabeled RNA strands were synthesized from the in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI) the posttranscriptional RNAs were electrophoresed in a 5% polyacrylamide\u20138 M urea gel and further purified by the use of a poly-Gel RNA extraction kit. the labeled release strand and unlabeled template strand were incubated at a proper ratio in a 10- oligonucleotides a RNA1 GUGUAGUAAUCGUCCAU RNA3 AUGGACGAUUACUACACCAACAGAUCAAUCCG RNA3-3 AUGGACGAUUACUACACCAACAGAUCAAUCCG RNA3-4 AUGGACGAUUACUACACCAACAACAC RNA3-4 AUGGACGAUUACUACAC RNA3-3 AUGGACGAUUACUACAC RNA3-3. 10 pmol of recombinant protein was added to 0.1 pmol of HEX-labeled helix substrate in a buffer containing 50 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 8.0), 2.5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.01% bovine serum albumin [BSA], 1.5 U/l RNasin, and 2.5 mM ATP. after incubation hybridization of 46-nucleotide (nt) and 146-nt RNA strands predicted by mfold. shorter HEX-labeled strand was 5\u2032-GCGGAUAAUUUCACACAGGAAUGACCAUGAUUACGA-3\u2032. longer unlabeled strand was 5\u2032-CGGCAAGUGGACGAUUAUCUCCAGAGGAUCGCCGGGAACCGAGGACGAGGACGAGGACGAGUUC a typical assay was carried out in 25-l reaction volumes containing 50 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 8.0), 25 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 2.5 mM NTP, and 10 pmol protein. the reaction mixtures were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min, and then 80 l of malachite green-ammonium molybdate reagent was added to the reactions for 15 min of incuba pFastBacHTA-MBP vector originated from the vector pFastBacHTA (invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) into which the maltose-binding protein (MBP) was N-terminally fused by our laboratory as previously described (45\u201348) point mutations were introduced into the corresponding templates via PCR-mediated mutagenesis with appropriate primers containing the desired nucleotide changes. expression and purification of recombinant proteins performed as previously described. expression and purification of recombinant proteins were performed as previously described. RNA helices/duplexes consisted of two complementary oligonucleotide strands. shorter one was labeled at the 5\u2032 end with hexachlorofluorescein (HEX) all unlabeled DNA strands were purchased from Invitrogen. helix substrates with different sizes of 3\u2032 tails were annealed with RNA1 and RNA4. helix substrates with different sizes of 3\u2032 tails were annealed with RNA3-3, RNA3-4, RNA3-5, and RNA3-6. all DNA and RNA oligonucleotides are listed in Table 2. the indicated amount of recombinant protein was incubated with 0.1 pmol of HEX-labeled helix substrate. helix destabilizing assays are indicated with boldface characters. labeled RNA strands at 37\u00b0C in buffer containing 50 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 8.0), 2.5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT, 0.01% BSA, and 1.5 U/l RNasin. sequences of HEX-labeled and unlabeled RNA strands were processed as indicated. the two complementary strands were mixed (0.1 pmol each) and reacted in the absence (lanes 3 to 6) or presence (lanes 7 to 10) of MBP-2C (5 pmol) for the indicated times (5 to 20 min) for panels B and C, the mixture was boiled (to prevent spontaneous annealing) or treated with a thermal cycler (lane 2) as a negative or positive control, respectively. HEX-labeled RNA (RNA1) and long nonlabeled RNA (RNA2) were annealed to generate a standard RNA helix substrate with both 5\u2032 (22 bases) and 3\u2032 (23 bases) single-stranded tails. helix destabilizing assay was performed by incubating the RNA helix substrate with purified MBP-2C in a standard destabilizing reaction mixture. boiled helix substrates were used as positive controls. results indicated that EoV 2C has RNA helix destabilizing activity. Lanes 1 and 2, boiled (lane 1) or native (lane 2) reaction mixtures without 2C addition; lane 3, complete reaction mixture with MBP-2C. we also sought to determine whether MBP-2C could destabilize helix substrates containing DNA. each helix substrate was incubated with MBP-2C under the same reaction conditions. the life cycle of picorna-like viruses does not involve a DNA stage. we used RNA helices as substrates in the following experiments. they contained a 3\u2032 single-stranded tail (23 bases), a 5\u2032 single-stranded tail (22 bases) and blunt ends (as illustrated in the top panels of Fig. 3A and B) each substrate alone (lanes 1 and 3) or boiled 5\u2032-tailed substrate (lane 5) was used as a control. the RNA helix destabilizing activity of EoV 2C is bidirectional. the helix destabilizing activity of EoV 2C is apparently distinct from the activity of known viral RNA helicases. RNA helix destabilizing activity of EoV 2C is NTP independent. standard RNA helix substrate (3\u2032 plus 5\u2032 tailed) (0.1 pmol) was reacted with MBP-2C in the absence or presence of indicated NTP (2.5 mM) native or boiled substrates without 2C addition were used as controls. ATP concentrations inhibited the helix destabilizing activity of EoV 2C. higher ATP concentrations had an inhibitory effect on the helix destabilizing activity. we further assessed the destabilizing activity of MBP-2C at various low ATP concentrations. a series of RNA helix substrates with increasing lengths of 3\u2032 single-stranded tails were generated and then reacted with MBP-2C in the absence of ATP or other NTPs. the length of the 3\u2032 tail of RNA helices showed no obvious effect on the helix destabilizing activity of 2C. RNA chaperones should have higher efficiency to destabilize a less stable helix (with lower energy) but have lower efficiency to destabilize a more stable helix (with higher energy) the shorter RNA helix contains 17 matched base pairs together with a 5\u2032 single-stranded tail (20 bases) and a 3\u2032 single-stranded tail (23 bases) ATP, HCV NS3 showed no activity to destabilize either the shorter or longer RNA helix. a 0.1-pmol volume of RNA helix substrate was reacted with 5 pmol MBP-2C in the absence of ATP. a 5-pmol volume of MBP-fusion HCV NS3 and MBP alone were used as controls for the RNA helix destabilizing assay. in the absence of 2C, little annealing was observed (lane 3 to 6), while the presence of 2C dramatically promoted the hybridization of the two strands. annealing stimulation by 2C was dose dependent, as the increasing dose of 2C resulted in an increase in hybrid formation. a shorter (46-nt) labeled RNA strand was incubated with a longer (146-nt) nonlabeled RNA strand. of MBP-2C reached 5 pmol (lane 5), and 10 pmol MBP-2C resulted in an even stronger annealing stimulation (lane 6). this results show that EoV 2C has annealing stimulation activity that is dependent on the dose of 2C. a 5\u2032-tailed RNA helix substrate (0.1 pmol) was reacted with MBP-2C in the presence of indicated divalent metal ions at 2.5 mM. the highest unwinding activity was observed at 0 mM Mg2+ (lane 3), while the increase in Mg2+ concentration from 0 to 15 mM resulted in a gradual decrease. helix destabilization by 2C was completely blocked when concentration of Zn2+ reached 1.5 mM. however, at lower (0.5 to 1 mM) Zn2+ concentrations, 2C was moderately inhibited. the inhibitory effects of Mg2+ and Zn2+ were rendered in a dose-response manner. ATP and GTP preference of EoV 2C is similar to that of poliovirus 2C. poliovirus 2C (61, 63) has NTPase activity. MBP-2C was reacted with the indicated NTP or dNTP. the absence of Mg2+ almost abolished the 2C ATPase activity. the optimal pH for both helix destabilizing and ATP hydrolysis was the same (pH 8.0); the helix destabilizing activity of 2C was Mg2+ dispensable (pH 8.0); the ATPase activity was Mg2+ indispensable (pH 8.0) a series of point mutations of conserved residues within motifs A, B, and C were constructed as indicated in Fig. 11A. the conserved residues correspond to canonical Walker A and B boxes, consisting of an NTP binding site and a divalent metal ion coordination site. the H1562A mutation almost blocked the RNA helix destabilization by MBP-2C. but moderately increased its ATPase activity. sequence analysis of the EoV 2C ORF and the mutagenesis strategy can be separated. both RNA helicase and RNA chaperone contain the activity to destabilize short RNA helices (27). a comparison of the predicted 2C domain (aa 1374 to 1789) of EoV polyprotein (Fig. 1A) with those of the 2C proteins from other picorna-like viruses in the Iflaviridae and Picornaviridae families indicated that EoV 2C contains all the three conserved SF3 signature motifs. boiled helix substrates were used as positive controls. the results indicated that EoV 2C has RNA helix destabilizing activity. mixture with negative-control MBP alone; lane 3, complete reaction mixture with MBP-2C; lane 4, complete reaction mixture with MBP-2C. we also sought to determine whether MBP-2C could destabilize helix substrates containing DNA. each substrate was incubated with MBP-2C under the same reaction conditions as were used for the experiment. the life cycle of picorna-like viruses does not involve a DNA stage. to determine directionality, we generated three different RNA helix substrates. a 3\u2032 single-stranded tail (23 bases), a 5\u2032 single-stranded tail (22 bases) and blunt ends. the RNA helix destabilizing activity of EoV 2C is bidirectional. this is apparently distinct from the activity of known viral RNA helicases that exhibit either 3\u2032-to-5\u2032 or 5\u2032-to-3\u2032 directionality (28). this observation led us to question whether EoV 2C is really an RNA helicase. standard RNA helix substrate (3\u2032 plus 5\u2032 tailed) (0.1 pmol) was reacted with MBP-2C in the absence or presence of indicated NTP (2.5 mM) native or boiled substrates without 2C addition were used as controls. the presence of 2.5 mM ATP dramatically inhibited the helix destabilizing activity of EoV 2C at the molar ratio of 10:1. the presence of 2.5 mM ATP dramatically inhibited the helix destabilizing activity of EoV 2C at the molar ratio of 10:1. helix destabilizing activity of 2C requires presence of a 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 single-stranded tail. previous studies showed that some viral RNA helicases prefer longer single-stranded tails for their helix destabilizing activity. length of 3\u2032 tail of RNA helices showed no obvious effect on the helix destabilizing activity of 2C. RNA chaperones should have higher efficiency to destabilize a less stable helix (with lower energy) but have lower efficiency to destabilize a more stable helix (with higher energy) the shorter RNA helix contains 17 matched base pairs together with a 5\u2032 single-stranded tail (22 bases) and a 3\u2032 single-stranded tail (23 bases), while the longer one contains 42 matched base pairs together with a 5\u2032 tail (20 bases) a 0.1-pmol volume of RNA helix substrate was reacted with 5 pmol MBP-2C in the absence of ATP or other NTP. a 5-pmol volume of MBP-fusion HCV NS3 (plus 2.5 mM ATP) and MBP alone were used as controls. 2C demonstrates helix destabilizing activity to \u201cunwind\u201d structured RNA strands and stimulate annealing. the presence of 2C dramatically promoted the hybridization of the two strands. the increasing dose of 2C resulted in an increase in hybrid formation. a shorter (46-nt) labeled RNA strand was incubated with a longer (146-nt) nonlabeled RNA strand for 30 min in the absence of MBP-2C. EoV 2C has annealing stimulation activity that is dependent on the dose of 2C. the 46-nt RNA strand is HEX labeled as indicated by an asterisk. the two strands were mixed (0.1 pmol for each strand) mM Zn2+ even abolished RNA helix destabilization. standard RNA helix substrate (3\u2032 plus 5\u2032 tailed) (0.1 pmol) was reacted with MBP-2C in the presence of indicated divalent metal ions at 2.5 mM. helix destabilization by 2C was completely blocked when concentration of Zn2+ reached 1.5 mM. however, at lower (0.5 to 1 mM) Zn2+ concentrations, 2C was moderately inhibited. however, at lower (0.5 to 1 mM) Zn2+ concentrations, 2C was moderately inhibited. the NTPase activity of EoV 2C was measured as nanomoles of released inorganic phosphate. the NTPase activity of EoV 2C was determined at the indicated pH (B), at the indicated concentrations of NaCl (C) orMgCl2 (D), or with indicated divalent metal ions at a concentration of 2.5 mM (E). for panels A to E, the complete reaction mixture with MBP alone was used as the negative control our data show that this ATPase activity is Mg2+ dependent. the absence of Mg2+ almost abolished the 2C ATPase activity. we found that EoV 2C has both RNA helix destabilizing and ATPase activities but that the helix destabilizing activity is independent of ATP. conserved motifs A and B correspond to canonical Walker A and B boxes. the conserved residues correspond to canonical Walker A and B boxes. the conserved motifs A and B correspond to canonical boxes. the RNA helix destabilizing and ATPase activities of EoV 2C can be functionally separated. mutagenesis strategy and sites of replacement with alanine indicated by a star. eukaryotic proteins were subject to 10% SDS-PAGE. a picorna-like virus 2C protein has the ability to ATP-independently destabilize RNA helix and stimulate annealing of cRNA strands. the role of an RNA chaperone is to facilitate the escape of locally misfolded RNA molecules from \u201ckinetic traps\u201d and promote the formation of most thermodynamically stable and functional structures of RNAs. poliovirus 3AB exhibited optimal nucleic acid chaperone activity at a protein-to-nucleic-acid ratio of approximately 30:1 to 100:1 (34, 35), and HIV-1 NC had optimal chaperone activity at a ratio of approximately 20:1 to 50:1 for minus-strand transfer (51). poliovirus 3AB exhibits its RNA chaperone-like activity in a manner that is the same as or similar to that of polio in the current study, EoV 2C was unable to shift ssRNA in a gel shift assay. the binding of 2C to RNA is too weak and transient to be detected by the gel shift assay. a possible explanation is that the binding of 2C to RNA is too weak and transient to be detected by the gel shift assay. many viral RNA chaperones, including HIV-1 NC, Vif, and Tat, hantavirus N, flavivirus core, and coronavirus N, have been predicted to contain intrinsic disordered regions (26, 67, 68) the disorder of hantavirus N was predicted by another algorithm (VL-XT) (68), and we recalculated it using DisProt Predictor VL3 and predicted similar disordered regions (data not shown) large positively charged regions have been predicted for EoV 2C. large positively charged regions could destabilize RNA structures. multivalent metal cations, such as Mg2+, could inhibit RNA destabilization and strand annealing by stabilizing RNA conformation and competing with RNA chaperones. 2C is the most conserved picornaviral protein. it is plausible that Zn2+ is able to directly bind EoV 2C. ATPase activity previously led to speculation that picornaviral 2C proteins are RNA helicases that utilize the energy provided by ATP hydrolysis to unwind the RNA helix. RNA chaperone-like activities of EoV 2C are independent of each other. rotavirus NSP2 also contains these two activities, as previously reported. multiple cis-acting elements may require RNA chaperone activities to aid proper folding. picornavirus 2C protein displays ATP-independent RNA helix destabilizing and strand annealing stimulation activity which is functionally separated from its ATPase activity. this should extend our understanding of Picornavirales and viral RNA chaperones."}
