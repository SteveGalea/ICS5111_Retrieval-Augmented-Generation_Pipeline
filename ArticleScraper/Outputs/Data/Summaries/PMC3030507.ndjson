{"summary": "we reported an outbreak of 70 cases of severe pneumonia with one death of infants in Shaanxi Province, China. adenovirus 7 (Ad7) was the primary pathogen with some co-infections. the entire hexon gene of adenovirus was sequenced and analyzed for the two adenovirus serotype 7 isolates. approximately one-fifth of all HAdV infections reported to the world health organization were attributed to HAdV-7[1,2], the diseases reported include respiratory tract illnesses and conjunctivitis. in infants and immuno-compromised populations, HAdV-7 can cause outbreaks of severe disease; in a few cases can lead to death[3]. endmic distribution was scattered in some villages with the most in Xixiang County without a central tendency. the admitting diagnosis was 56 with bronchopneumonia, 11 with bronchitis, two with acute tonsillitis, and one with lobar pneumonia. a characteristic adenovirus-like CPE was observed in the HEp-2 cells from two pharynx swabs samples. an enterovirus-like CPE was found for the two other samples. the entire hexon genes were amplified from the two adenovirus isolates using adenovirus-specific primers. strain 0901 HZ was identified as a HAdV-7 strain belonging to the B1 species. the phylogenetic tree of strain 0901 HZ compared to other reference strains of adenovirus. the CCID50 was determined to be approximately 105.0 CCID50s/50. conventional neutralization tests were performed using 12 pairs of paired serum samples. the neutralization titers of the convalescent-phase samples were four times higher than those of the acute-phase samples. by 9 February 2009, the outbreak affected a total of 70 children in the Hanzhong area. PCR or RT-PCR PCR or RT-PCR was performed with five pharynx swabs specimens. xon genes were amplified from the two adenovirus isolates using PCR with adenovirus-specific primers to obtain the predicted product of 3,162 bp. a viral strain designated HAdV7-0901 HZ was isolated from the pharynx sample of the dead patient. the coding sequence for the hexon was 2,805 bp, 96.3-99.8% with HAdV-7 prototype and vaccine strains comparing strain Ad7 0901 HZ was identified as a HAdV-7 strain belonging to the B1 species. the phylogenetic tree of strain 0901 HZ compared to other reference strains of adenovirus. more cases of upper respiratory tract infectious disease occurred from 1 January to 6 February in 2009 (389 cases) than in 2008 (261 cases), an increase of 48.8%, from the Xixiang Chinese Medicine Hospital and Hanzhong Central Hospital (unpublished data). we found climate factors changed such as drought showed little rain and lower temperature in this area. in the early 1980s, a new genome type Ad7d became the dominant dominant strain. in a long-term survey of adenoviral pneumonia in Beijing (1958-1990), HAdV-7 was associated with a higher fatality rate than HAdV-3[11]. serotype 7 isolates in this study have not been performed because reference strains were unavailable. comparison of the predicted amino acid sequences with other adenovirus 7 genotypes shows strain 0901 HZ lost glutamine at site 253 similar to the Korean strain. the role of these changes in the adenovirus antigenicity is not known. the index case was a one-year-old female from Xixiang County, Hanzhong, Shaanxi Province. she had an onset on 15 January with an admission to Hanzhong Central Hospital with complaints of cough, expectoration asthma with a fever for 5 days. the clinical diagnosis was acute bronchitis with heart failure and toxic encephalopathy where the patient died on 30 January. dilutions of serum samples (1:8 to 1:1,024) were prepared. 50 l of each dilution was added to four wells of a 96-well microplate. the entire virion of the HAdV strain isolated and identified was used as the neutralization virus. the PCR reaction was performed using a GeneAmp 9700 thermal cycler. the amplification products were analyzed by electrophoresis of the samples in 1% agarose gels. the primers of human respiratory syncytial virus, human parainfluenzavirus, human rhinovirus and enterovirus were donated by colleagues. bronchopneumonia + HAdV-7 Cell swallon +/- 1:8 /d 7 female 1y 07/02/2009 bronchopneumonia + / ND - 1:32 /d 8 male 10m 28/01/2009 congenital cardiopathy +a / - + 1:128 /d 9 male 9m 31/01/2009 bronchopneumonia + HAdV-7 - - 1:32 /d 12 female 8 the nucleotide sequence homology was inferred from the identity scores obtained using the BLASTn program. the reliability of the tree was estimated with 1,000 bootstrap pseudo-replicates. hep-2 cells were cultured in a maintenance medium at 37\u00b0C in a closed system without added CO2. primary identification of positive isolates was performed using adenovirus-specific primers. the 11 RNA respiratory viruses include influenza A and B virus, human respiratory syncytial virus A and B, human metapneumovirus, human parainfluenzavirus, human metapneumovirus, human parainfluenzavirus, human coronavirus 229E/NL63 and OC43. the DNA respiratory virus was human adenovirus[19] and species-specific PCR of species B described by Pring-.kerblom. 2009 bronchopneumonia + HAdV-7 - + 1:32 1:128 2 male 2y 31/01/2009 bronchopneumonia +a HAdV-3 - - 1:128 1:128 3 female 2y 31/01/2009 bronchopneumonia + HAdV-3 - + 1:8 1:128 4 male 2y 09/01/2009 bronchopneumonia + HAdV-7 cell swallon +/- 1:8 /d bronchopneumonia + / cell lysis +/- 1:8 1:128 17 male 2y 22/01/2009 bronchopneumonia + HAdV-3 - + 1:8 1:32 18 male 8m 28/01/2009 bronchopneumonia -b / - + 1:512 1:128 19 female 1y 09/02/2009 bronchopneumonia + HAdV-7 - +/- 1:8 1:512 20 male 2 authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors' contributions LT and XT performed the experiment."}
