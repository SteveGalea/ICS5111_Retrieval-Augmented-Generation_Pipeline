{"summary": "the pandemic would lead to 1.2% to 2.7% loss of medical work time. most workdays would be lost due to illness, followed by hospitalisation. most workdays would be lost in the peak week, and 3% over a more compressed six-week period. new Zealand's primary health care strategy puts primary care at the centre of the country's health system. it defines a future where primary care and public health strategies are expected to be coordinated and intermeshed. the model assumes no public health interventions are used to control disease spread. the default values used in fluAid were used for the mortality rates, hospitalisation rates and rates of illness. the default values for the incidence rates of clinical illness were also used. working doctors are likely to be in better health than the general population. the fluAid model does not consider the time frame of the pandemic within an affected region. for the baseline analysis the distribution of cases and a duration of eight weeks was used. the proportion of cases in the peak week was raised to 40% (from 32.3%), the upper limit of the days of hospitalisation was used. working doctors are likely to be in better health than the general population. they have fewer risk factors associated with severe sequelae from influenza infection. the proportion of doctors assumed to be in the \"high-risk\" category was arbitrarily halved. the pandemic wave was assumed to last only six weeks. the upper range \"maximum\" values from the FluAid model were used. the proportion of cases in the peak week was raised to 40%. 142 0.4 \u2013 0.9% 3 0.2 1 \u2013 3 59 \u2013 137 2 12 \u2013 25 126 \u2013 294 139 \u2013 321 0.9 \u2013 2.1% 4 0.3 2 \u2013 4 77 \u2013 180 3 15 \u2013 33 165 \u2013 386 184 \u2013 422 1.2 \u2013 2.7% 5 0.2 1 \u2013 2 43 \u2013 101 4 9 \u2013 19 93 \u2013 217 106 \u2013 240 0.7 \u2013 1.6% a mortality rate of 65 per 100 000 is predicted for the \"more severe\" scenario. the result suggests that the major contributor to lost workdays will be episodes of uncomplicated illness that do not require hospitalisation. health authorities and doctors themselves could stockpile and then use antivirals at the appropriate time. pandemic planning needs to include specific measures to maintain the functional capacity of health care workers. rapid action at the start of the pandemic to cancel elective procedures could also enhance workforce capacity. a review of the foundations for a SARS preparedness and response plan has highlighted the importance of appropriate staffing and support. improving health sector surge capacity now would be desirable as the health sector is often running at stretched capacity (e.g., especially emergency departments) a greater focus on the primary care nursing workforce would be of benefit. a review of nosocomial outbreaks reported a health care worker incidence rate to be as high as 60%. other parameters used in the modelling may have been overly conservative. there was also no consideration in the model of absenteeism effects from fear of infection. for the \"more severe\" scenario a mortality rate of 65 per 100 000 is predicted. this is much less than the total population rate for the 1918 pandemic in new Zealand. the results suggest that the major contributor to lost workdays will be episodes of uncomplicated illness that do not require hospitalisation. general practices and health authorities can consider plans to provide care for the ill dependents of their medical staff so as to reduce absenteeism rates. rapid action at the start of the pandemic to cancel elective procedures could also enhance workforce capacity. strategies are needed to manage the psychological impact of pandemic influenza on health care workers. this trend raises the possibility of increasing substitution of GP work roles by nurses. this has occurred for a decade or more in community-governed non-profit practices. a recent review of the medical workforce in new Zealand highlights potential efficiencies from some role shifting from doctors to other health workers. there are still plausible reasons why they could be overestimate. these include: various international and national public health interventions may reduce the impact of pandemic influenza. improved treatment could lower hospitalisation and mortality rates."}
