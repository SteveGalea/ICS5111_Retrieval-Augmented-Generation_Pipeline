Molecular Interactive Collaborative Environment (MICE)-1998 The Molecular Interactive Collaborative Environment (MICE) is an application that provides collaborative, interactive visualization of complex scientific data in 3-D environments. users can view molecular scenes on their own computer, but to distribute these scenes and interact with other users anywhere on the Internet. iSee offers saved view states, but it is not quite a scientific wiki because of its prepackaged annotation system. key features include 2-D image and 3-D molecular structure annotation support in real-time. the annotation system is not limited to predefined ontological categories. research and development of scientific collaboratories has been a tool-centric approach. collaboratories can move beyond developing general communication mechanisms to evaluating and supporting data sharing. social network services are an example of a novel communication channel that has attracted large numbers of participants. researchers must use data organization and workflow management tools to share the context of their data. the ability to quickly search and retrieve complex 3-D data in real time is critical to the efficiency and productivity of large-scale research work. Molecular Interactive Collaborative Environment (MICE)-1998 The Molecular Interactive Collaborative Environment (MICE) provides collaborative, interactive visualization of complex scientific data in 3-D environments within which multiple users can examine complex data sets in real time. iSee-2006 iSee is a software tool that allows users to leverage structural biology data by integrating data from many sources into a single data file and browser. users can browse annotated structures, add new annotations, and evaluate existing ones. the files are small enough to be sent as an e-mail message. the browser runs under Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems. the C-ME backend architecture enables these features and is built on Windows Server 2003, Microsoft SQL Server 2005, and Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 (MOSS 2007). C-ME includes a public domain client application for the Windows XP and Vista operating systems that can be downloaded from http://c-me.scripps.edu. the user can access this information with C-ME which uses Web services to read and write data to and from the MOSS 2007 server. the user also has the option to access that data through a standard Web browser (Figure 2). a MOSS 2007 entity site accessed using the Firefox web browser on a Linux computer. the data and annotations used in C-ME reside in various MOSS 2007 portal project and entity web sites (bottom\u2013orange) each project and entity has its own site for data and annotations (bottom\u2013red) the rapid prototyping has enabled us to review iterations of the prototypes in two-week cycles. the rapid prototyping has enabled us to review iterations of the prototypes in two-week cycles providing bug and usability feedback to the developers for the next cycle of development. a 3D Community-Based Collaboratory System allows multiple participants to jointly create and edit web pages. the wiki is essentially an encyclopedia collaboratively written by volunteers [10], [11]. by allowing researchers to publish their data sets to a larger community through a publicly or privately available data portal, a \u201cwiki-like\u201d research community. data management & information Hierarchies C-ME organizes data into a hierarchical structure that displays the organization of a data set at three abstraction levels. each layer of the hierarchy contains one or more instances of the layer below it. each project can have an associated image to provide context for any data to be added to the project. user interface C-ME presents a user with an intuitive interface that reflects the three levels of information within the system. individual windows on the left side of the screen reflect the selections made by the user at each level of the system. the top left window reflects the projects that are currently established on the system. annotations provide additional information and points of discussion for a molecular structure. text notes, URLs, files, screen captures and discussions are all types of annotations that can be added to a structure or image. annotations provide additional information and points of discussion for a molecular structure. Notes General text descriptions can be added as a Note annotation. URL A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) annotation is an HTML link that can be attached to an entity. screen capture annotation allows an arbitrary rectangle of the user's screen to be captured as an image. relying on industry-standard commercial off-the-shelf software products, C-ME addresses three areas of concern related to security: authentication and information access, data backup, and data transport. system administrators or lab directors can control access and grant varying levels of privilege\u2014from \u201cRead Only,\u201d to \u201cContribute,\u201d to \u201cDesign Pages\u201d. visp.scripps.edu is an NIH-funded project that requires the production of over 30 SARS virus proteome proteins. the second project is the Cancer Bioengineering Research Project (CBRP) this project is focused on detecting rare circulating tumor cells in blood specimens from cancer patients. trainees can also add modules to C-ME as they pursue special interests in one disease or another, eventually creating a training \u2018wiki\u2019 for future year trainees. the application will be enhanced to increase its utility. researchers can create wiki-style collaborations for internal or distributed laboratory environments. it provides collaborators real-time access to data organized at the molecular and project levels. it complements existing visualization and collaboration software tools such as iSee, Kinemage, MICE, and BioCoRE. data organization\u2013Data entered into C-ME is organized in a hierarchical system that allows creation of projects containing multiple sub-projects. data consistency\u2013All data is stored in one location so that all users access the same data from the C-ME application. annotations are anchored to specific locations in the 2-D or 3-D entities. an annotation is always placed in a specific context and in a precise relationship to related annotations. the application does not provide advanced molecular viewing features. annotations to molecule entities can be attached to the entire molecule, a set of user-defined amino acid residues, or a set of user-defined atoms. a user can either double-click the annotation from the list in the lower left window or select the annotation flag from the graphical window to open that annotation. commonly used file annotations include generic text files, images, audio or video media files, and PDF files. commonly used file annotations include generic text files, images, audio or video media files, and PDF files. a window appears to enter the subject of the discussion and the actual text of the discussion. another user can double-click this discussion and select a particular subject. other users with access to that entity can view all the entries in the discussion and contribute if desired. new annotations can be added on the spot. the reader can step through the annotations extracted from the paper. a guided display feature of C-ME will also be used to share ideas, concepts and data with external collaborators. instructors can present molecular-based material to students at a level of detail not available in print textbooks. instructor prepares appropriate annotations ahead of class time, and students reviewing the material after class can add comments or leave questions for the instructor. a user would be able to perform searches within and across projects or entities to find relevant documents, notes, and other annotations related to the search criteria. this would allow users to send an email or initiate an instant messenger session to discuss annotations and results if the other users or collaborators are currently using C-ME. .82 MB SWF) Click here for additional data file."}
