{"summary": "several elegant reviews have recently emerged describing the importance of cysteine cathepsins in both normal physiology and human diseases. the focus of this review is specifically on human cathepsin L, a ubiquitously expressed endopeptidase whose involvement in several human diseases has emerged. a detailed and up-to-date report on existing cathepsin L-targeting small molecule inhibitors and functional probes with their mechanistic details is described. the coding space includes the regions of a N-terminal signal peptide, two pro-peptides, and two mature peptides comprising of a heavy (H) chain and a light (L) chain. the resulting 41 kDa pro-cathepsin L is translocated the trans Golgi network recognize the M6P-pro-cathepsin peptide and deliver the pro-cathepsin L peptide to the lysosome via the endolysosomal pathway. the weakly acidic environment of endosome/lysosome releases M6P receptors and the phosphate group from mannose sugars is removed by a lysosomal acid phosphatase. Activation to mature ca pro-cathepsin L is shuttled to lysosome by endolysosomal pathways. propeptides act as an important regulatory on/off switch and a folding catalyst in cathepsin activation. the dominant pathway of regulation of activated and mature cathepsin L is by endogenous protein inhibitors, cystatins. the dominant pathway of regulation of activated and mature cathepsin L is by endogenous protein inhibitors, cystatins, that like propeptide compete with the physiological substrates for binding to the enzyme active site. cathepsin L degrades two autophagosomal markers, LC3-II and GABARAP-II. the specialized podocyte cells in the kidney play a critical role in the retention of various proteins required to be maintained in blood plasma. early investigation by Stypmann et al. on a year old Ctsl/ mice showed that they developed many key traits of dilated cardiomyopathy. the newborn Ctsl/ mice acquired increased number of acidic organelles, although with altered morphology and function. this was corroborated by an overexpression study of cathepsin L in mice cardiomyocytes that showed cardioprotective effect by inhibiting the Akt signaling pathway. cathepsin L cleaves trypsinogen to produce enhanced levels of active trypsin promoting pancreatitis. regulated secretory vesicles house many mature function-ready enkephalin opioid peptides. regulated secretory vesicles of the neuroendocrine system house many mature function-ready enkephalin peptides. early studies by Gottesman revealed extracellular cathepsin L levels can increase up to 200-fold in transformed cells. in the ECM environment, they can rapidly degrade several structural components and significantly increase the migratory/invasive potential of these cells, promoting metastasis. a selective substrate and substrate-based inhibitor of cathepsin K was developed by Choe et al. in a seminal study, shenoy et al. studied substrate specificity using a highly diversified positional scanning synthetic combinatorial library comprised of 160,000 fluorogenic tetrapeptides. this allowed to differentiate individual enzymes\u2032 binding propensity based on their distinct amino acid preferences. different ligands may find slightly altered binding interactions with the enzyme subsites. this finding has been corroborated by other studies that suggest structural features of ligands can influence the subsite composition of the cathepsin L enzyme. epoxysuccinyl-leucylamido(4-guanidino)butane) contains an epoxide ring as an electrophilic warhead. it traps the active site catalytic cysteine residue of the protein. e-64 showed only a marginal selectivity towards cathepsin L compared to cathepsin B and a moderate 24-fold selectivity over cathepsin H.

three of the developed CLIK inhibitors were hydrolytically stable and showed highly selective inhibition for hepatic cathepsin L in vivo. three of the developed CLIK inhibitors were hydrolytically stable and showed highly selective inhibition for hepatic cathepsin L in vivo. this class of inhibitors occupied the active site of the enzyme and irreversibly inactivated cysteine cathepsins. the free enzyme activity was not recovered when the enzyme-inhibitor complex was exposed to exhaustive ultrafiltration (up to an enzyme/free inhibitor ratio of 1:0.05) papain, a prototypical cysteine protease, and peptidyl hydroxamate inhibitors covalently modified active-site Cys residue via sulfenamidation. this class of inhibitors covalently modified active-site Cys residue via sulfenamidation, like in their N-peptidyl-O-acyl hydroxamate counterparts. authors developed a library of inhibitory compounds with a general sequence, Z-Phe-X-CH2OCO-R. they systematically varied the amino acid residue at P1 (denoted as X) and P1\u2032 (denoted as R) positions. authors found five most selective non-covalent, peptidyl inhibitors of cathepsin L, and transformed them into irreversible inhibitors. this class of inhibitors found wide-spread utilities in detecting protease activity. a reversible cathepsin L inhibitor was transformed to an irreversible one by strategically galvanizing an electrophilic warhead. peptidyl aziridines is a very interesting class of inhibitors. type-I inhibitors resemble classic aziridine scaffold, N-unsubstituted aziridines with aziridine as N-terminal amino acid, analogously to E-64 where nitrogen of aziridine remained unsubstituted. this class of inhibitors lacks practical utility as the catalytic cysteine of cathepsin L starts to lose its activity below pH 4. type III inhibitor class is comprised of N-acylated bispeptidyl derivatives of aziridine, where aziridine ring rests in the middle of the peptide. both exhibited only a marginal selectivity over cathepsin B with diminished eudysmic ratio. authors superimposed and analyzed structures of certain epoxide and aziridines. peptidyl aryl vinylsulfones is an irreversible inhibitor of cysteine cathepsins. the scaffold was first introduced by Palmer et al. as an irreversible inhibitor of cysteine cathepsins. the authors developed a structurally novel library of 20 peptidyl 3-aryl vinylsulfones. peptidyl aryl vinylsulfonate esters, a superior Michael acceptor than vinyl sulfone. they served as potent inhibitors of cruzain\u2014a parasitic cysteine protease from T. cruzi that is homologous to cathepsin L. they also designed a hybrid inhibitor, KD-1, by strategically appending the 4-bromophenyl vinylsulfonate moiety as electrophilic warhead to a reversible peptidyl cathepsin L-selective inhibitor, KD-1, was tethered to a known reversible peptidyl cathepsin L-selective inhibitor. this inhibitor likely binds to both prime- and non-prime sites of the enzyme. amide A and its analogs effectively inactivated cruzain, a homologous cysteine protease from T. cruzi. this led to the discovery of the most potent analog of this series. the authors found that this class of compounds effectively inactivated cruzain. the most potent cathepsin L inhibitor of this series was Z-Phe-Phe-H (IC50 = 0.74 nM) that showed more than 90-fold selectivity over cathepsin B. their data showed the importance of aromatic amino acids, such as phenylalanine and tyrosine, at the P1 position. the substituent at P1 position does not interact with S1 position residues. the substituent at P1 position preferred a hydrophobic and moderate-size group. -branched alkyl chains but not the bulkier groups like phenylalanine. the authors crystallized the glyoxal inhibitor with cathepsin L. the -aldehyde forms a tetrahedral thiohemiacetal and -keto oxygen atom is stabilized by the oxyanion hole. this class of inhibitors has successfully been deployed in the functional biology of cathepsin L. replacement of cathepsin K inhibitor with bulkier hydrophobic aromatic groups yielded an improved potency and selectivity towards cathepsin L. molecular docking studies further supported this observation as cathepsin K was found to have a shallower S2 pocket than cathepsin L. inclusion of bulkier napthyl group at P2 position favored cathepsin L inhibition but not cathepsin K. hardegger et al. used nitrile warhead and examined the effect of halogen bonding in protein\u2013ligand interactions. they developed a series of compounds and performed a thorough SAR analysis in which the nitrile electrophile faced towards S1 site and trapped the catalytic cysteine. the authors synthesized a diverse set of triazine-nitrile compounds with a diversified heteroarenes targeting the S3 pocket. 2-benzothienyl analog (Entry 21, Table 2) exhibited maximum inhibitory potential; 2-benzofuranyl, 2-benzothiazolyl, and 2-imidazopyridinyl followed a similar inhibitory pattern. the authors developed a series of 36 analogs by varying only S2 substituents and keeping S1 and S3 fixed. they found that the FEP method was superior over other well-established methodologies. this method predicted the most relevant ligands but also identified the topological requirements of the substituents for a more effective engagement. the most active class of inhibitors were comprised of one meta-bromo substituted aryl ring and another with optimally substituted functionalities. the inhibitor places itself in the active site cleft of cathepsin L where meta-bromo substituted aryl ring occupies the active site. thiosemicarbazone motif lies near the active site cysteine. a series of synthesized tripeptidyl compounds mimicked cathepsin L inhibitory propeptide [95]. a moderate truncation of the full-length propeptide drastically lost all activities. authors propose to evaluate its in vivo efficacy in a preclinical setup. thiocarbazate, Oxocarbazate and Azapeptides are small molecule inhibitors of cathepsin L. they identified 2,5-disubstituted oxadiazoles as potent hit compounds. this showed the presence of impurities resulting from an acid-catalyzed ring-opening reaction of thiocarbazate. oxocarbazate showed a fairly improved IC50 value (7 nM) towards cathepsin L. the azapeptide was at best only a modest inhibitor (IC50 = 3 M) the oxocarbazate showed a fairly improved IC50 value. oxocarbazate inhibited propagation of malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum [IC50 = 15.4 M], and Leishmania major [IC50 = 12.5 M], and did not exhibit any significant toxicity against human aortic endothelial cells and zebrafish. the lack of reasonable stability and only modest inhibitory activity in cell-based assays probably ceased any further development of the scaffold. xocarbazate inhibitors have historically played a crucial role in deciphering the cysteine protease biology. this class contains an epoxide ring as an electrophilic warhead that traps the active site catalytic cysteine residue of the protein. xocarbazate inhibitors showed only a marginal selectivity towards cathepsin L compared to cathepsin B. 2nd Order (103 M1 s1) 73 Cat S: 89 Irreversible (In

this was intended to investigate its effect in determining selectivity toward cathepsin L or S. s-Arg-OBzl (Entry 2, Table 2) showed a significant 89-fold selectivity for cathepsin L over cathepsin S. three of the developed CLIK inhibitors were hydrolytically stable. the specificity toward cathepsin L was attributed to the existence of phenylalanine residue at the S2 site. Peptidylhydroxylamines were first introduced as mechanism-based inhibitors of serine and cysteine proteinases. this class of inhibitors occupied the active site of the enzyme and irreversibly inactivated cysteine cathepsins. this class of inhibitors exhibited rapid and selective inactivation of several lysosomal cysteine proteinases. the active site Cys residue attacks the carbonyl of the hydroxamate and forms a tetrahedral intermediate. the nitrogen of the hydroxamate, which remains deprotonated, engages in electrostatic interaction with the active site His159 residue. peptidyl acyloxymethanes is a class of peptidyl inhibitors that span the active site and utilizes the catalytic machinery of cathepsin L for effective attenuation of enzyme activity. the authors discovered five most selective non-covalent, peptidyl inhibitors of cathepsin L, and transformed them into irreversible inhibitors. the attachment of the AOMK group drastically impacted the selectivity profiles of these inhibitors. this class of inhibitors found wide-spread utilities in detecting protease activity. they were used to develop activity-based probe; this will be discussed in the later sections. type II inhibitors resemble classic aziridine scaffold, N-unsubstituted aziridines with aziridine as N-terminal amino acid, analogously to E-64 where nitrogen of aziridine remained unsubstituted. this class of inhibitors thus lacks practical utility as catalytic cysteine of cathepsin L starts to lose its activity below pH 4. zi-Leu-OBzl (Entry 13, Table 2) inactivated cathepsin L with higher second-order rate constant than EtO-(S,S)-Azi-Leu-OBzl. the latter showed better selectivity over cathepsin B. the type III inhibitor class is comprised of N-acylated bispeptidyl derivatives of aziridine. peptidyl aryl vinylsulfones Another promising scaffold that acts as a Michael acceptor is peptidyl aryl vinylsulfones. the scaffold was first introduced by Palmer et al. as an irreversible inhibitor of cysteine cathepsins. authors postulated that strong anti-cancer candidates could be harnessed by cultivating this scaffold. scaffold was explored by Dana et al., who determined the superiority of aryl vinylsulfonate ester over aryl vinylsulfonate ester and aryl vinylsulfonamide counterparts towards cathepsin L inhibition. reversible peptidyl cathepsin L-selective inhibitor, KD-1 binds to both prime- and non-prime sites of the enzyme. the peptidyl backbone of the inhibitor spans the active site while the side chains engage in favorable interactions with different active site pockets. the authors found that this class of compounds effectively inactivated cruzain, a homologous cysteine protease from T. cruzi, using cell-based assay. they found that this class of compounds effectively inactivated cruzain, a homologous cysteine protease from T. cruzi. the most potent cathepsin L inhibitor of this series was Z-Phe-Phe-H (IC50 = 0.74 nM) that showed more than 90-fold selectivity over cathepsin B. their data showed the importance of aromatic amino acids, such as phenylalanine and tyrosine, at the P1 position. the configuration of the stereogenic center (S-configuration is favored over R-configuration) at the P1 position, and not the steric factor, was key to the inhibitory efficacy. a further modification of this scaffold was reported by Lynas et al. the compound Z-Phe-Tyr(OBut)-COCHO (Entry 18, Table 2) turned out as highly potent and selective inhibitor of cathepsin L with Ki value of 0.6 nM. the authors crystallized the glyoxal inhibitor with cathepsin L; the -aldehyde forms a tetrahedral thiohemiacetal and -keto oxygen atom is stabilized by the oxyanion thepsin L inhibitor exerted remarkable selectivity over cathepsin K and fairly modest selectivity over both cathepsin B and S. Molecular docking studies further supported this observation as cathepsin K was found to have a shallower S2 pocket than cathepsin L. inclusion of bulkier napthyl group at P3 position favored cathepsin L inhibition but not cathepsin K. nitrile group-containing inhibitors forms an unstable thioimidate bond with the cat. nitrile's tunable target engagement nature has been adapted to target other relevant enzymes, including cathepsin. aryl groups were screened and evaluated to harness favorable halogen-protein interaction. the authors synthesized a diverse set of triazine-nitrile compounds with a diversified heteroarenes targeting S3 pocket of cathepsin L. the authors developed a series of 36 analogs by varying only S2 substituents. this method predicted the most relevant ligands but also identified the topological requirements of the substituents for a more effective engagement in the S2 pocket. catalytic cysteine residue of cathepsin L forms a covalent and reversible bond with the thiosemicarbazone group rendering the inhibited enzyme. thiosemicarbazone motif lies near active site cysteine. the phosphate prodrug showed a 600-fold increase in solubility over the parent drug. this compound did not disintegrate in aqueous solution, even after prolonged exposure at the physiological temperature. authors have proposed to evaluate its in vivo efficacy in a preclinical setup. the methionine residue showed optimal interaction within S1\u2032 pocket. the biphenyl acetyl group extended to the S3\u2032 pocket for favorable interactions. this class provides a wealth of information on inhibitor binding to cathepsin L. oxocarbazate showed a fairly improved IC50 value (7 nM) towards cathepsin L, whereas the azapeptide was at best only a modest inhibitor (IC50 = 3 M). the azapeptide was at best only a modest inhibitor (IC50 = 3 M) hibitor complex showed a slow-binding kinetics and reversibility of inhibition. thiocarbazate motif showed promise as an inhibitory scaffold. oxocarbazate inhibited propagation of malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. an activity-based cysteine cathepsin probe showed reduced cathepsin L labeling when assessed by a Western-blot analysis. this further corroborated the results obtained from the virus pseudotype infection assay. the concept of Activity-Based Probes (ABPs) has emerged as a valuable chemical biology tool. the use of ABPs has established cathepsins as key diagnostic marker for various disease conditions. a thorough overview of cathepsin probe development could be found elsewhere [10,159,160,161]. the peptidyldiazomethane scaffold inhibited both cathepsin L and B. this scaffold showed improved inhibition profile upon iodination. the developed probe was used to detect both cathepsin L and B in Kirsten-virus-transformed KNIH 3T3 cells. probes enabled the detection of active cathepsin enzymes with their cellular location, thereby advancing the knowledge of cathepsin L biology.

KDP-1 also interfered with the hatching process of post-fertilized zebrafish embryos. newly developed probes exerted promising selectivity toward both recombinant proteases and proteases from cancer cell lines, HCT-116 and MDA-MB-231. each of the protease-specific probes exerted a similar labelling efficiency in HCT-116 cells. inhibitors of cathepsin B and S are currently being evaluated in clinical trials. recent failure of cathepsin K inhibitor Odanacatib in late stage clinical trial has made pharmaceutical industries wary of targeting cathepsins. key challenge remains gaining inhibitor selectivity with respect to the other members of cathepsins and directing them to the targeted cell types for selective functional perturbation. ray 1.50 [186] 2XU1 X-ray 1.45 [121] 2XU3 X-ray 0.90 [121] 2XU4 X-ray 1.60 [121] 2YJ2 X-ray 1.15 [97] 2YJ8 X-ray 1.30 [97] 2YJ9 X-ray 1.40 [97] 2YJB X-ray 1.40 [97] 2YJC X-ray 1.14 [97] 3BC3 ethering a cytotoxic drug with an antibody via a protease-sensitive module for targeted delivery. the protease-cleavable prodrug strategy has also inspired the development of cathepsin B selective probe and even enabled real-time monitoring of drug release."}
