{"summary": "conventional influenza vaccines that are available to prevent seasonal flu outbreaks depend mainly on the surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) (1, 2). HA- and NA-based conventional influenza vaccines sometimes fail to prevent flu epidemics because the HA and/or NA in the vaccine strains is a mismatch with that in circulating virus strains (3\u20137) mice immunized with DNA vaccines based on PB1 from PR8 or BJ95 were protected against sublethal PR8 challenge. mice immunized with PB2-based DNA vaccines were not. recent studies suggested vaccines based on NP conferred protection in mice challenged with a lethal virus dose. alternate prime-boost strategies were used to develop combination vaccines for stable and long-term protection. a DNA prime-adenovirus boost strategy greatly improved cross-protection induced by NP-based vaccines. the prime-boost strategy provided protection against the homologous virus.

SMNC suspensions were treated with 4 g/ml NP147\u2013155 (TYQRTRALV), PB1317\u2013325 (MFLAMITYI), or M195\u2013106 (KAVKLYRKLKRE) for 30 h at 37\u00b0C. the choice of peptides used was PR8 is a mouse-adapted influenza strain that was propagated on 9-day-old chick embryos at 34\u00b0C for 48 h. the allantoic fluid was collected and stored at 70\u00b0C until use. one LD50 is equal to 103.6 50% tissue culture infective doses. universal forward primer for influenza A virus, 5\u2032-AGCAAAAGCAGG-3\u2032, and total RNA were used to generate full-length cDNA transcripts for influenza A virus BJ95 using a ThermoScript reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) system. the cDNA corresponding to the PB1 gene was generated using the forward primer 5\u2032-ACGGATCCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCAT the entire open reading frames of the NP, PB1 and M1 genes in pMD18T were digested using BamHI, BamHI, and SmaI, respectively, and inserted into the shuttle vector pSCA. the plasmids were propagated in Escherichia coli strain DH5 cells, purified using Qiagen-tip 500 kits. a virus Tiantan strain contains two back-to-back promoters (p11 and p7.5) the plasmid contains the lacZ gene downstream of the late p11 promoter. the early and late promoter p7.5 was empty loaded for the insertion of foreign genes. recombinant vaccinia virus (rVV-c) was generated using same method with empty pJSA1175 vector. expression of NP, PB1, and M1 proteins confirmed using indirect immunofluorescence. expression of target proteins confirmed 24 to 36 h later using immunoblotting. mice were bred under specific-pathogen-free conditions at the Institute of Occupational Health and Poison Control (IOHPC), Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC). groups of mice were intramuscularly (i.m.) inoculated with vaccines in the bilateral gastrocnemius without the use of any reagent or equipment. none rVV-PB1 (107) 9 M1 None rVV-M1 (107) 10 NP + PB1 + M1 None rVV-NP/PB1/M1 (10:10:10) pSCA-NP/PB1/M1 (10:10:10) pSCA-NP/PB1/M1 (10:10:10) rVV-NP/PB1/M1 (10:10:10) rVV-NP/PB1/M1 (10:10: the combined immunization group was injected with 10 g of pSCA-NP, 10 g of pSCA-PB1 and 10 g of pSCA-M1 mixed in a total volume of 100 l of PBS. the second group was immunized with rVV alone (rVV) the third group was immunized with a DNA prime-rVV boost (DNA + rVV) mice immunized with DNA-c (pSCA-c) and rVV-c were used as the control group. blood samples were collected from all mice in each group on week 8, the sera were separated by centrifugation. serum IgG titers were determined, and the spleens were removed aseptically and ground through a 200-mesh sieve. the antibody levels in serum were expressed as endpoint titers and had an optical density at 450 nm (OD450) that was >2.1-fold higher than the mean OD450 of serum samples from the unvaccinated mice. the choice of peptides used was based on previous reports and our previous experiments. plasmids pSCA-NP, pSCA-PB1 and pSCA-M1 were generated using the cDNAs from pMD18T-NP, pMD18T-PB1 and pMD18T-M1 respectively. expression of NP, PB1, and M1 in MDCK cells transiently transfected with pSCA-NP, pSCA-PB1 and pSCA-M1 proteins was confirmed using indirect recombinant vaccinia virus expressing influenza A virus NP, PB1 and M1 from H3N2 BJ95 virus could protect against influenza A virus PR8 challenge in mice. plasmids containing influenza A virus NP, PB1 and M1 were verified by sequencing and restriction enzyme digestion. expression of NP, PB1, and M1 in rVV-NP-, rVV-PB1-, and rVV-M1- immunoblotting revealed the presence of proteins with molecular masses of 56, 86.5, and 28 kDa that were recognized by rabbit polyclonal NP-specific antiserum, goat polyclonal PB1-specific antibodies, and goat polyclonal M1-specific antibodies. the bottom shows the cDNA fragments of influenza virus BJ95 (H3N2) PB1, NP, and M1 after restriction digestion with BamHI or SmaI, as appropriate, NP, and M1 from rVV-PB1 (lane 1)-, rVV-NP (lane 2)-, and rVV-M1 (lane 3)-infected CEF cell lysates stained with polyclonal or monoclonal antiserum indicated in Materials and Methods. mice were vaccinated intramuscularly with the DNA plasmids, rVV, or DNA prime-rVV boost. pSCA-M1 prime-rVV-M1 boost immunization induced a slightly, but not significantly, higher ELISA IgG titer than that of rVV-M1 alone. DNA prime-rVV boost immunization induced the highest IgG titer among the three groups. three mice in each group were euthanized at week 8. pSCA-NP and rVV-NP induced a cellular immune response. pSCA-PB1 prime-rVV-NP boost immunization induced a stronger cellular immune response. pSCA-PB1 and rVV-PB1 vaccines induced a PB1-specific cellular immune response (68 47.7 SFC/106 SMNCs) NP-PB1-M1 combination vaccines induced only NP-specific cellular immune responses. DNA prime-rVV boost immunization induced the strongest immune response (P 0.01) in contrast, NP-PB1-M1 combination-based vaccines and DNA prime-rVV mice immunized with pSCA-NP + rVV-NP began to gain weight on day 6 postchallenge. mice were challenged with 1.7 LD50 of influenza virus PR8 at week 8. mice were monitored daily for 17 days after challenge. survival rates were calculated following challenge. mice immunized with pSCA-M1 + rVV-M1 had a 40% survival rate. this was significantly higher than those immunized with rVV-M1. 80%, 80%, and 100% of the mice immunized with combined DNA, rVV, and DNA+rVV survived. combination immunization with pSCA-NP, pSCA-PB1 and pSCA-M1 induced strong protection. rVV-M1 exhibited poorer protective efficacy than did rVV-PB1. highest protective efficacy was induced by rVV-NP. all mice immunized with pSCA-NP or rVV-NP showed weight loss and died. those immunized with pSCA-NP + rVV-NP showed only 15% weight loss and began to gain weight by day 6 postchallenge. 100% of the mice in this group survived, which was significantly higher than the survival rates in the other two groups (P 0.001) mice were immunized with vaccine control (A), NP (B), PB1 (C), M1 (D) or a combination of the NP, PB1, and M1 (E) DNA, rVV, or prime-boost DNA-rVV vaccines (Table 1) at the times indicated in Fig. 3. mice were monitored daily for 17 days after challenge. control groups succumbed to infection, as did mice immunized with pSCA-NP or rVV-NP. mice immunized with pSCA-NP + rVV-NP exhibited 17% weight loss. mice immunized with combination NP-PB1-M1 vaccine succumbed to infection with 10 LD50 of PR8. mice were weighed daily to detect morbidity. the mean weights in each treatment group were followed for the duration of the study. the percentage of the original body weight was calculated based on the mean weight of each group at day 0. cDNA fragments of influenza viruses pSCA-PB1, NP, and M1 flanked by pSCA-PB1 and pSCA-M1. recombinant vaccinia viruses were then generated by homologous recombination with vaccinia virus Tiantan strain. plasmids containing influenza A virus NP, PB1 and M1 were verified by sequencing and restriction enzyme digestion. a plaque-purified clone matching the exact cDNA of the target gene sequence was used in all subsequent experiments. the expression of NP, PB1, and M1 in rVV-NP-, rVV-PB1-, and rVV-M1-infected cells was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence (Fig. 2B) and immunoblotting. plaques formed in rVV-PB1-, rVV-NP-, and rVV-M1-infected HeLa cells stained with the polyclonal or monoclonal Abs indicated in Materials and Methods. the bottom images show the expression of influenza PB1, NP, and M1 from rV-PB1 (lane 1)-, rVV-NP (lane 2)-, and rVV-M1 (lane 3). rVV-NP vaccination induced robust serum IgG titers compared with those of the control groups (P 0.001) pSCA-NP prime-rVV-NP boost immunization induced a higher IgG titer than that of the two above-mentioned groups (P 0.001). however, no obvious IgG response was induced by the PB1-based vaccine, regardless of whether it was applied alone or in the prime-boost pSCA-NP (60 25.9 [mean SD] SFC/106 SMNCs) and pSCA-NP (60 25.9 [mean SD] SFC/106 SMNCs) were used as stimulants in ELISPOT assays. pSCA-PB1 prime-rVV-PB1 boost immunization induced a stronger cellular immune response. pSCA-PB1 prime-rVV-PB1 and rVV-PB1 vaccines induced a PB1-specific cellular immune response. NP-PB1-M1 combination vaccines induced only NP-specific cellular immune responses. control groups treated with pSCA-c, rVV-c, or pSCA-c + rVV-c showed significant weight loss beginning on day 4 and peaking on day 9 postchallenge. mice immunized with pSCA-NP, rVV-NP, and pSCA-NP + rVV-NP had 80%, 100%, and 100% survival rates, respectively, which were not significantly different (P > 0.05) in the PB1-based vaccine groups, mice immunized with pSCA-PB1, rVV-PB1 and pSCA-PB1 + rVV-PB1 had survival rates of 20%, 50%, and 40% respectively. the mice immunized with pSCA-PB1 + rVV-PB1 had a 40% survival rate, which was significantly higher than those immunized with rVV-M1. 80%, 80%, and 100% of the mice immunized with combined DNA, rVV, and DNA+rVV survived after challenge with 1.7 LD50 of PR8 respectively. pSCA-PB1 had the least protective efficacy, followed by pSCA-M1; optimal protection was afforded by pSCA-NP immunization. rVV-M1 exhibited poorer protective efficacy than did rVV-PB1 vaccines conferred partial protective immunity against infection with 1.7 LD50 of influenza A virus PR8 in mice. the protective efficacy of NP-, PB1-, and M1-based vaccines was poorer than that of the NP-based vaccines. the mice in control groups showed significant weight loss and succumbed to infection by day 9 after challenge. only pSCA-NP + rVV-NP immunization resulted in optimal protection. only the DNA + rVV vaccination strategy completely protected the mice. ization with three-antigen-based DNA or rVV vaccines conferred fair protection against challenge with 1.7 LD50 and 5 LD50 of PR8. DNA prime-rVV boost immunization protected mice completely against challenge with 1.7 LD50 and 5 LD50 of PR8. pSCA-NP or rVV-NP immunization did not protect against challenge with 10 LD50. nine groups of mice were immunized with the vaccine control (A), NP (B), or a combination of the NP, PB1, and M1 (C) DNA, rVV, or prime-boosted DNA-rVV vaccines. mice were challenged with 10 LD50 of influenza virus PR8 at week 8. the mice were monitored daily for 17 days after challenge. PB1- and M1-based vaccines induced only limited protection against challenge with 1.7 LD50 of PR8. PB1- and M1-based vaccines induced only limited protection against challenge with 1.7 LD50 of PR8. NP is preferred candidate antigen in the research and development of UIVs. 80% of mice immunized with NP-PB1-M1 combination vaccines survived challenge with 10 LD50 of PR8. this suggests that the addition of PB1 and M1 reduced the immune response and protection induced by NP. there are several possible reasons for this: interference among the candidate antigens. several combination vaccines that yielded less interference have been generated. adenovirus-based vaccines contain a fusion of NP to M1. rVV-based vaccine contains multiple T epitopes of the M1, nonstructural 1 (NS1), NP, PB1 and polymerase acidic (PA) influenza virus proteins. DNA prime-adenovirus boosting strategy significantly improves NP-induced cross-protective effect. pSCA-PB1 prime-rVV-NP boost strategy induced effective protection against PR8 challenge. pSCA-NP prime-rVV-NP boost strategy induced stronger cellular immune response. immunity with NP, PB1 or M1 does not elicit the production of neutralizing antibodies. protective immunity is mediated by NP-, PB1-, or M1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) immune responses. this suggests that the NP-specific humoral and cellular immune responses, PB1-related cellular response, and M1-related humoral response might play roles in protection against heterologous challenge. BALB/c mice were also used in the present study to confirm the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of the NP-, M1-, and PB1-based universal vaccines. other mouse strains, such as CBA and C57/BL6, mount stronger responses against PB1 or M1 (72) s used single intraperitoneal inoculations in mice (64, 75) vaccinia virus-vectored vaccines induced a stronger immune response with intraperitoneal than with intramuscular administration. intramuscular inoculation is preferred for routine use in humans."}
