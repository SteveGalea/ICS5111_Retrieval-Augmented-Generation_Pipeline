{"summary": "gene-culture coevolution mediated by domestication of plants and animals has been argued to provide some of the clearest and most spectacular examples of niche construction. in the history of Homo sapiens sapiens, a particularly important event that triggered a new and striking gene-culture-coevolution cycle was the development of agriculture and animal domestication during the Neolithic period. studies with Native American populations can provide useful information for better understanding gene-culture coevolution and the niche construction processes. studies with Native American populations can provide useful information for better understanding gene-culture coevolution and the niche construction processes. the 230Cys allele (Arg230Cys, rs9282541) of the ABCA1 gene was exclusively present in Native American and mestizo individuals. this variation in HDL-C concentration was the highest one associated with a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) among different continental populations in these genome-wide association studies. new data for Arg230Cys polymorphism were generated for 19 Amerindian populations (n = 229) from Meso/Central America and South America (Table 1). additional information about these tribes can be found in Bortolini et al. [25], [26], Wang et al. [27], and Mazi\u00e8res et al. [29], [29].

[39] domestication origin from the wild grass teosinte (Zea mays ssp. parviglumis) in the Ro Balsas region, southwestern Mexico, approximately 6,300\u201310,000 calendar years before present [44]\u2013[53]. to test the connection between maize culture and the ABCA1*230Cys variant, we used allele frequencies from Mesoamerica/Central America populations. a molecular analysis of variance (AMOVA) test was performed to quantify the level of population structure observed within and between the 3 subdivisions adopted here. a significant difference was observed between the subdivisions (FCT = 0.036; p = 0.000); on the other hand, the highest FST among populations within subdivisions was observed in the South American hunter-gatherers/foragers. a comparison of south american hunter-gatherers/foragers and andean agriculturalists revealed no significant differences (p = 0.351) the allele age estimates were 12,097 YBP and 19,409 YBP. but the allele age obtained using the observed LD and a Bayesian approach, is relatively younger, 7,540 YBP, with a posterior probability of 99%. these results suggest that the ABCA1*230 allele frequencies in Mesoamerica are incompatible with a simple neutral model. each dot indicates a SNP (listed in item c.2 in the Materials and Methods section) only the ABCA1 locus showed significance at the 5% level (filled blue circle) a significant correlation was observed between the ABCA1*230Cys allele frequencies and the distribution of the Zea pollen relics in Mesoamerica. this indicates an opposite trend from what would be expected if the level of admixture with non-Indians was influencing our findings. a significant difference was observed between the subdivisions (FCT = 0.036; p = 0.000) on the other hand, the highest FST among populations within subdivisions was observed in the south American hunter-gatherers/foragers. a value 5 times lower was found among Mesoamerican agriculturalists. selection has increased the frequency of the allele to higher levels than expected by random genetic drift [54]. the joint distributions of the ABCA1*230 locus and 20 other SNPs were examined to test whether the ABCA1*230 locus and these SNPs departed from neutral expectation. the values obtained indicated that only the ABCA1*230 polymorphism departed significantly from neutral expectation. global and pairwise FST were higher for the ABCA1 region. the empirical dataset containing the ABCA1*230 polymorphism presented a poorer fit to neutrality than the putative neutral region dataset. a significant correlation was observed between the ABCA1*230Cys allele frequencies and the distribution of the Zea pollen relics. the maya and Guaym showed the highest and the lowest numbers of individuals with some level of recent admixture, respectively. this indicates an opposite trend from what would be expected if the level of admixture with non-Indians was influencing our findings. the values obtained indicated that only the ABCA1*230 polymorphism departed significantly from neutral expectation (p = 0.02; Figure 1). however, when the comparisons excluded the Mesoamericans (e.g., Andean agriculturalists vs. South American hunter-gatherer/forager subdivisions), no significant departure from the expected under neutrality was found. these results suggest that the ABCA1*230 allele frequencies in Mesoamerica are incompatible with a simple neutral model the empirical dataset containing the ABCA1*230 polymorphism presented a poorer fit to neutrality than the putative neutral region dataset. a significant correlation was observed between the ABCA1*230Cys allele frequencies and the distribution of the Zea pollen relics in Mesoamerica. maize is considered the most important native crop of the Americas. the date of its entry, as well as the dispersion pattern of this crop into and throughout South America remain controversial. bioarcheologists and paleopathologists have also detected a deterioration in Mesoamerican health indices from 8,000 to 500 years before present-YBP. domestic crops are more vulnerable than wild ones, crowding promotes crop diseases, and storage systems often fail. a diet based on one or only a few crops should have been deleterious to health in the pre-Columbian era [65] these findings can be considered as additional causal factors to the ABCA1*230Cys selective sweep associated with agricultural development. a sedentary village lifestyle with a corresponding growth in the density of the local population can promote an increase in the mortality rate, particularly in children under 5 years of age. south America presents much more diversity in relation to habitats, people, and culture than Mesoamerica. the level of consumption seen in Mesoamerica/Central America was not comparable to that of Mesoamerica/Central America [71]\u2013[73].
