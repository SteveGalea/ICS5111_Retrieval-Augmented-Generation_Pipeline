{"summary": "adaptive evolution in the tripartite motif-containing protein family is reminiscent of this prey\u2013predator-like \u2018arms race\u2019 between virus and host. gene expression differences rather than protein-coding changes may underlie some of the anti-retroviral immune mechanism. TRIM members that provide a post-entry defence against retroviral infection have been reported its signatures of positive selection were discovered in coiled-coil and B30.2 protein domain [9]. however, some TRIM members such as TRIM19/PML confers resistance to a broad range of DNA and RNA viruses [9], it did not show a signature of positive selection acting on the gene's coding region. extensive maps of DHSs have been created in over 140 cell types and high-resolution DNase I footprints in over 30 cell types [14] as part of the ENCODE Project and Roadmap Epigenomics Project, we analysed DHS in the TRIM region identified in the Encode Project [12] and fibroblasts of human, chimpanzee and macaque beside lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) of human and chimpanzee. we identified 26 474, 31 724 and 27 138 DHSs in the TRIM family region from human, chimpanzee and macaque fibroblasts. as a result, we identified 16 561 human-specific DHSs, 20 880 chimpanzee-specific DHSs, 17 069 macaque-specific DHSs and 11 239 common DHSs. ACC\u2019 LRT tested for distinguishing the evolutionary rate of DHS only in human lineage compared with the neutral sequence. results were evaluated by p-value, if the absolute value of the p-value is less than 0.05, then considered this DHS is significantly accelerated or conversed. we searched all single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the haDHSs identified by us from the 1000 genomes project. results indicated most of SNPs within haDHSs had low allele frequency, but still there was difference between different populations. each dot represents the allele frequency of SNP in AFR and EUR. the majority of TRIM genes, along with their DHSs, remain uncharacterized. the regulatory region of four antiviral host restriction factors, including TRIM8, TRIM11, TRIM13 and TRIM14, is undergoing positive selection, but there is no positive selection evidence in the protein coding region. human-specific losses were defined as cases where the sequence was a perfect match to the consensus sequence in the human branch only. as a result, we detected 31 potential transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) that were human-specific gained within 25 haDHSs. human-specific TFBSs in TRIM and MHC haDHS did not act as human-specific gain binding sites. however, SOX9 and GATA1 binding sites were detected both in TRIM and MHC haDHS. this indicates that SOX9 and GATA1 binding sites may undergo the selection pressure on a genome scale. tBR2 has been found to play a pivotal role in HIV-associated immune activation through regulation of the activity of CD8+ T lymphocytes. AP2 [52], SP1 [31], TGIF [34] and KROX [41] also have interaction with HIV viral proteins. human-specific sequence differences in transcription factor motifs found in these haDHSs are linked with these transcription factors. this suggests that fine-tuning regulatory networks by tinkering with the sequences that govern the expression of regulatory proteins has been an important target of positive selection during human evolution. LINE transposable elements showed the variant distribution of transposable elements associated with TRIM haDHS and con-DHS. the icons \u2018simple-rep\u2019 and \u2018low-com\u2019 represent simple repeats and low complexity transposable elements, respectively. we used experimentally defined maps of DHSs from 130 cell types identified in ENCODE. we identified 16561 human-specific DHSs, 20880 chimpanzee-specific DHSs, 17069 macaque-specific DHSs, and 11239 common DHSs. the results of these tests were evaluated by p-value, if the absolute value of the. 375 haDHSs were identified based on the \u2018ACC\u2019 and \u2018CON\u2019 test. results suggest most regulatory sequences have been selectively maintained through millions of years of primate evolution. only few DHSs are rapidly evolved in human lineage and conserved in other non-human primates. the allele frequency of SNP (within haDHS) in africa (AFR) and European (EUR) populations. each dot represents the allele frequency of SNP in AFR and EUR. human-specific losses were defined as cases where the sequence was a perfect match to the consensus sequence in the human branch only. human-specific losses were defined as cases where the sequence was a perfect match to the consensus sequence in five non-human primates' branches. chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, macaque and marmoset (electronic supplementary material, table S1). we found 31 potential transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) that were human-specific gained within 25 haDHSs. this included potential transcription factor binding sites of 28 transcription factors. however, none of the human loss motifs were found in the human-specific branch. X9 and GATA1 binding sites were detected in TRIM and MHC haDHS. both act as a human-specific gain binding sites. a significant fraction of regulatory variation can be attributed to changes in cis-regulatory sequences. AP2 [52], SP1 [31], TGIF [34] and KROX [41] also have interaction with HIV viral proteins. the corresponding haDHS was correlated with the antiviral factor TRIM23 (table 1). these data will provide us with further insights into the functional significance and potential regulatory roles of haDHSs. s are linked with these transcription factors, suggesting that fine-tuning regulatory networks by tinkering with the sequences that govern the expression of regulatory proteins has been an important target of positive selection during human evolution. our data provide substantial new insights into sequences that have experienced human-specific adaptive regulatory evolution. able elements associated with TRIM con-DHS and haDHS. icons \u2018simple-rep\u2019 and \u2018low-com\u2019 represent simple repeats and low complexity transposable elements, respectively. in the surrounding 50 kb, we additionally masked all segmental duplications (UCSC table browser), coding exons (UCSC RefSeq genes) padded by 10 bp to remove splice sites, promoters (500 bp upstream of transcription start sites), other DHSs, and phastCons Eutherian mammal and primate conserved elements (UCSC phyloP46way) phyloP was run with the parameters\u2014method LRT\u2014mode CON after removing the human sequence from the alignment. for this test, we used the same neutral model of evolution, this time using the same neutral model of evolution. s annotation files from UCSC identified transposable elements that overlapped with TRIM DHSs. we counted the transposable elements in different DHS regions and made a comparison. all peaks were called, using the hotspot algorithm [61] and represent the 150 bp region of maximal DNase I signal. we filtered any DHS in which either less than 90% of the bases remained unmasked in the DHS or less than 15 kb remained unmasked in any of the six primates in the neutral region. phyloFit was run on the neutral alignment of the surrounding 50 kb with the parameters\u2014nrates 4\u2014subst-mod SSREV\u2014EM. DHSs that were conserved at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 1% were then tested for human acceleration. for this test, we used the same neutral model of evolution, this time using the parameters. TRIM DHSs defines transposable elements in different DHS regions. we counted the transposable elements in different DHS regions and made a comparison using a chi-squared test to determine if the difference of transposable elements between different DHS regions is significant."}
