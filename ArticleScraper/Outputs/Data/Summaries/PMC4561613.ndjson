{"summary": "three airlines agreed to have their staff distribute a questionnaire to travelers during flights from australia to Christchurch, new Zealand. there were 302 flights eligible to take part in the study. the questionnaire sought information on symptoms, travel history, and background demographic variables. asyPlex Influenza A+B Kit, Cat.
