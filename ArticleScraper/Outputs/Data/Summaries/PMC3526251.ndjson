{"summary": "METHODS PubMed was searched using each of the following terms: respiratory virus, respiratory syncytial virus, metapneumovirus, parainfluenza, rhinovirus, enterovirus, picornavirus, coronavirus, polyomavirus, bocavirus. published studies were identified and reviewed in august 2011. majority of publications are retrospective observational studies. VIC is performed using conventional and/or shell vial cell culture techniques. DAD has a good clinical specificity, and a short turn-around time of 4 hours, but has a comparatively long turn-around time of 2\u20135 days. NAT is often preferred because of a higher sensitivity. sputum production, hypoxia, or pulmonary infiltrates together with identification of CARVs in respiratory secretions. meeting clinical criteria of RTID and laboratory criteria Clinical criteria New onset of symptoms AND at least 1 of the following 4 respiratory symptoms: Cough Sore throat Shortness of breath Coryza. diseases follow the community activity and reflect an increased risk of community-acquired, household, and nosocomial transmission. in the past, the standard diagnostic assays have been DAD and VIC. but these techniques have been replaced or complemented by NAT in many centers [14, 28] study suggests treating URTID in HSCT and leukemia at risk for LRTID and treating manifest LRTID with ribavirin and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) improves outcome. it should be recognized that proper meta-analyses were not possible, and the results should therefore be interpreted with caution. in HSCT recipients with URTID and LRTID, HPIV-3 is most commonly detected type in children. URTI has been associated with significant airflow decline in 40% of patients [37], which may progress to LRTID in 13%\u201337% and a fatal outcome in 10%\u201330%. metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a paramyxovirus closely related to RSV. rates range from 2.5% to 9% during the first 2 years after allogeneic HSCT. asymptomatic and prolonged shedding has been reported in HSCT patients. cases of LRTID with rhinitis, pharyngitis, and laryngitis have been reported in very young (age 1 year) and/or in immunodeficient patients. asymptomatic shedding may be as high as 41%. LRTID with frank pneumonia is rare and may occur in 10% of allogeneic HSCT infected with HRhV. the role of HRhV treatment is limited by the lack of agents and clinical trials. other human enteroviruses (HEnV), encompassing at least 66 serotypes, also belong to the Picornaviridae family. HPyV RTIs include KIPyV and WUPyV, which have been detected in 0.2% and 1.4% of children with acute URTID. in symptomatic children with leukemia or HSCT, higher viral loads in BAL have been reported [87] leukemia patients should avoid contact with individuals with RTI in the hospital and in the community. young children should be restricted from visiting patients and wards because of the higher risk of CARV exposure, prolonged shedding, and ease of transmission (BII) ECIL-4 Recommendations for Diagnosis of CARV Infection To balance costs and clinical benefit, screening all patients for CARVs is currently not indicated unless indicated in the context of an infection control investigation of nosocomial transmission and prevention. laboratory testing should focus on symptomatic patients. human parainfluenza virus; HSCT, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; LRTID, lower respiratory tract infectious disease; URTID, upper respiratory tract infectious disease. ECIL-4 Treatment Recommendations for CARV Infection Reflecting the clinical impact compared to other CARVs, the working group distinguishes the need of treatment for influenza A and B [10], RSV and HPIV, taking into account the higher risk for poor outcome in specific patient groups the working group is cautious about the use of intravenous monoclonal antibody specific for the RSV-F protein. only very young (age 2 years) allogeneic HSCT patients with LRTID or at high risk for progression to RSV LRTID might be considered for treatment with intravenous monoclonal antibody specific for the RSV-F protein. systemic ribavirin can be administered orally (BIII) or intravenously for patients unable to take oral medication (10\u201330 mg/kg body weight in 3 divided doses) patients on systemic ribavirin should be monitored and treated for adverse events including hemolysis, abnormal liver function tests, and declining renal function. no recommendation can be givenb a Modified after [14]. some experts use 200 mg once daily under close clinical and laboratory monitoring. withholding treatment for RSV infection might be considered for selected stable leukemia and HSCT patients. NAT is used as a generic term to describe molecular genetic tests such as polymerase chain reaction and others for the detection of viral DNA or RNA. direct antigen detection (DAD), used as a generic term to describe direct detection of antigens in a specimen using specific antibodies in different assay formats. URTI disease was defined as the detection of CARVs above and including the larynx (eg, in samples from nose, pharynx, larynx, conjunctivae, or sinuses) LRTI disease (LRTID) was defined as pathological sputum production, hypoxia, or pulmonary infiltrates together with identification of CARVs in respiratory secretions. RSV infections occur in 0.3%\u20132.2% of pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia. in 1%\u201312% of adult patients with hematological malignancy and HSCT. risk factors for LRTID include infection during preengraftment, lymphopenia, older age, allogeneic HSCT, and severe immunodeficiency. varying thresholds of lymphopenia have been reported in clinical studies. rapid diagnostics, infection control measures, and deferral of chemotherapy and/or HSCT are important considerations. corticosteroid treatment is a risk factor in leukemia patients. human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) species -1, -2, -3, and -4 cause mild URTID throughout the year. type-specific seasonal increases of URTID and LRTID with laryngotracheitis, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia are seen in 15% of infected children during autumn and spring. some centers consider treating HPIV URTID in patients with risk factors for LRTID and HPIV LRTID, with ribavirin and/or IVIG. asymptomatic and prolonged shedding has been reported in HSCT patients [36, 69, 70]. HCoVs are divided into group 1\u2013like (CoV-229E and -NL63) and group 2\u2013like (CoV-OC43 and -HKU1) agents that are molecularly distinct. most centers use NAT in multiplex formats, reporting rates of 5.7% among acutely symptomatic patients. URTID with rhinitis, pharyngitis, and laryngitis is the most common manifestation. in allogeneic HSCT recipients, HRhVs have been identified as the most frequent CARVs, reaching a cumulative incidence as high as 22.3% by day 100. prolonged shedding over 4 weeks is frequent, with coinfections with other CARVs occurring in 19% of patients. human bocavirus (HBoV) and human polyomavirus (HPyV) infections have been detected in patients with hematological malignancies or HSCT. however, studies of cases with a well-documented clinical course and proven disease by histopathology are missing. risk factors for disease and the need for therapy are not well defined. graft-vs-host disease, cytomegalovirus reactivation, neutropenia, lymphopenia, hospitalization, or death. there are currently no data supporting the treatment of KIPyV or WUPyV LRTID. infections occur year-round but peak during cold season. varying thresholds of lymphopenia have been reported in clinical studies. corticosteroid treatment is a risk factor in leukemia patients. but the role of corticosteroids is controversial, since improving respiratory function has been seen. human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) species -1, -2, -3, and -4 cause mild URTID throughout the year. type-specific seasonal increases of URTID and LRTID with laryngotracheitis, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia are seen in 15% of infected children during autumn and spring. risk factors for LRTID are higher corticosteroid exposure, neutropenia, lymphopenia, infection early after allogeneic HSCT, a higher APACHE II score. some centers consider treating HPIV URTID in patients with risk factors for LRTID and HPIV LRTID. no general recommendation for treatment can be made. some centers consider treating HMPV LRTID with IVIG. cases of rhinitis, pharyngitis, and laryngitis are reported. HRhVs circulate throughout the year and are the most common cause of URTID (rhinorrhea, postnasal drip, cough) and occasionally (tracheo-bronchitis) the incubation period has been estimated as 1.9 days (95% CI, 1.4\u20132.4) [50] human bocavirus (HBoV) and human polyomavirus (HPyV) infections have been detected in patients with hematological malignancies or HSCT. however, studies of cases with a well-documented clinical course and proven disease by histopathology are missing. graft-vs-host disease, cytomegalovirus reactivation, neutropenia, lymphopenia, hospitalization, or death were associated with detection. routine testing for KIPyV and WUPyV cannot be recommended. there are currently no data supporting treatment of KIPyV or WUPyV LRTID. administration of IVIG preparations to HSCT and leukemia patients with hypogammaglobulinemia 4 g/L may reduce the risk of morbidity or mortality secondary to CARV RTIDs. ECIL-4 Recommendations for Diagnosis of CARV Infection. first-line diagnostic testing should be performed for influenza A and B, RSV, and HPIV (AII) patients with LRTID should be considered for BAL and broader diagnostic testing including lung biopsy. deferral of conditioning therapy should be considered for patients with CARV RTID planned for allogeneic HSCT. patients with RSV URTID undergoing allogeneic HSCT should be treated with aerosolized or systemic ribavirin and IVIG (BII) allogeneic HSCT patients with RSV LRTID or at high risk for progression to RSV LRTID may be considered for treatment with intravenous monoclonal antibody specific for the RSV-F protein (eg, palivizumab 15 mg/kg body weight) this drug should not be considered in other patient groups. hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; IVIG, intravenous immunoglobulin; LRTID, lower respiratory tract infectious disease; respiratory syncytial virus. some experts use 200 mg once daily under close clinical and laboratory monitoring. ral of conditioning/chemotherapy should be considered for patients with CARV-RTID scheduled for autologous HSCT or chemotherapy for hemato-oncological diseases (BIII). treatment of CARV RTID other than influenza is not generally recommended for patients undergoing autologous HSCT or chemotherapy for hemato-oncological diseases (CIII). well-designed studies are lacking that evaluate diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for CARV.
