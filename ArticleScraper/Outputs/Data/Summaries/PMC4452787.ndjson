{"summary": "PCV2 is a member of the genus Circovirus in the family Circoviridae. it is now accepted as the primary causative agent of naturally occurring PMWS. this disease primarily affects weanling piglets and is clinically characterized by fever, unthriftiness, respiratory distress, enlarged lymph nodes, and occasional jaundice and diarrhea. the virus was predicted to possess 11 overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) on the viral strand, there is the ORF1 (nucleotides 51\u2013995) gene, which encodes the Rep and Rep' proteins essential for PCV2 replication [22] on the complementary strand, there are the ORF2 (nucleotides 1735\u20131034), ORF3 (nucleotides 671\u2013357) and ORF4 (nucleotides 565 a new putative viral gene (designated ORF5 in this study) overlaps the ORF1 gene and is read in the same direction. the gene is approximately 180 bp (spanning nucleotides 553\u2013732) and encodes a polypeptide that is predicted to be of 6.5 kDa in molecular weight. no data exist that confirms the existence of a novel ORF5-encoded protein or its potential biological implications. a novel ORF5 protein is not essential for PCV2 replication at either the transcription or translation level. we then demonstrated for the first time that the PCV2 ORF5 protein both prolongs the S-phase of the cell cycle and induces a signaling cascade that results in the activation of NF-B. this NF-B activation leads to the upregulation of interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8) and Cyclooxygenase-2 RT-PCR and Quantitative Real-time PCR Total cell RNA was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen, USA) reverse transcription of the RNA was conducted using the PrimeScript RT reagent Kit with gDNA Eraser (TAKARA, China) the resultant PCR product was electrophoresed in 1% agarose gel.

RNA was isolated from PCV2-infected cells and copied into cDNA. positive fragment was amplified from the PCV2 genome using RT-PCR. at 48 h after transfection, ORF5 protein expression was determined by western blot analysis using the mouse anti-ORF5 polyclonal antibody. to test viral infectivity, the collected total lysates from genome-transfected PK-15 cells were used to infect PCV-free PAMs at an MOI of 1.0. primer pairs were used to amplify a segment of porcine -actin. the primers F-actin and R-actin were used to amplify a segment of porcine -actin. cell proliferation assay performed using cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8/WST-8). cells transfected with either pEGFP-ORF5 or pEGFP-C1 for 48 h were fixed with 75% ethanol for 3 days at 4\u00b0C. a set of control cells were also subjected to the same experimental conditions. data analysis was performed using the CXP Software (Beckman) on the basis of the FSC-SSC (forward light scatter-side scatter) dot plot. data analysis was performed using the CXP Software (Beckman) on the basis of the FSC-SSC (forward light scatter-side scatter) dot plot. the Y2H yeast strain was transformed simultaneously with pGBKT7-ORF5 and the prey plasmid pGADT7. plasmid pGADT7 contained a PAM cDNA library of 2 106 clones. total cellular RNA extracted from wPCV2-infected and mock-infected PAMs was subjected to RT-PCR and northern blot hybridization. a total of four RNA bands of approximately 950 bp, 750 bp, 300 bp and 180 bp were found. no hybridized band was detected in mock-infected cells. IFA analysis was used to demonstrate that the PCV2 ORF5 protein initiates expression during the early stage of infection. positive control cells expressing the PCV2 Cap protein were also analyzed at 48 hpi and no signals were detected in either mock-infected cells. however, the ORF5-specific mouse pAbs could not detect a signal for the ORF5 protein in wPCV2-infected PAM lysates. Lane f, pEGFP-C1-transfected PAMs were probed with the pAb against PCV2 ORF5 protein. at 48 h after infection, the cells were fixed and labeled with the rabbit anti-Cap pAbs (panel b) or mouse anti-ORF5 pAbs (panel c) wPCV2, rPCV2 and PCV2 were harvested at 12, 24, 36, 48, 72 and 96 h post-infection. viral DNA and virus titers were quantified by real-time PCR and IFA. however, PCV2 replicated at a slightly reduced rate prior to 36 hpi. mRNA copies of ORF1, ORF2, ORF3, ORF4 and ORF5 were examined by qRT-PCR. expression levels of ORF1 and ORF2 transcripts in PCV2-infected cells were significantly lower than those measured in wPCV2-infected cells from 12 hpi to 72 hpi. cellular total mRNA was harvested at six time points from 12 to 96 h post infection. it was treated with gDNA eraser and tested by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. the protein inhibits cell proliferation via prolongation of the cell cycle. the proliferation of GFP-ORF5-expressing cells and control cells was measured by CCK8 assay. in a recent study, PCV2 replication has been found to be both S- and G2/M-phase dependent [38], indicating the possibility that the ORF5 protein might be involved in cell cycle progression. the cells expressing GFP-ORF5 protein and control cells were subjected to western blot using anti-GFP antibody. the qRT-PCR and western blot assays were employed to measure CycA mRNA and protein levels. the GFP-tagged PCV2 ORF5 protein has no effect on cell apoptosis. the effect of the ORF5 protein on apoptosis was assessed in PAMs. the effect of the ORF5 protein on apoptosis was assessed in qRT-PCR. the results are mean SD from three independent experiments. the GFP-tagged PCV2 ORF5 protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), whereas the GFP protein was predominantly located in the nucleus and to a lesser degree in the cytoplasm. all the cells were stained by Hoechst33342 and ER-Tracker Red. the GFP-tagged PCV2 ORF5 induces ER stress in PAMs. mRNA levels of IL-6, IL-8, and COX-2 in GFP-ORF5 expressing cells were significantly higher than in control cells. expression of GFP-ORF5 promoted a relative upregulation of the expression of IL-6, IL-8, and COX-2 expression in PAMs. analysis of IL-6, IL-8 and COX-2 mRNA levels were normalized to the corresponding CT value for porcine -actin mRNA. results are mean SD and representative of three independent experiments. pEGFP-ORF5 was treated with 10 M MG132, 30 M BAPTA-AM, 50 M E64, or 20 mM NH4Cl starting at 24 h after transfection. a total of 16 positive clones were rescued, sequenced and analyzed. number of cDNA clones found Description of cDNA clones and best hits of homolog proteins identified in databases 5 Partial cDNA encoding aa 2\u2013208 of porcine transmembrane glycoprotein NMB precursor. yeast strain Y2H was co-transformed with pGBKT7-based bait and pGADT7-based bait. interaction of the ORF5 protein with the five cellular proteins GPNMB, CYP1A1, YWHAB, ZNF511 and SRSF3 was indicated by growth of blue colonies on QDO/X plates. total cellular RNA extracted from wPCV2-infected and mock-infected PAMs was subjected to RT-PCR and northern blot hybridization. no immunoreactive signal was observed between the pAbs and ORF1-encoded protein expressed from either E. coli or PAMs. to verify whether the protein was expressed in replicating PCV2, PAMs were infected with wPCV2 or PCV2 as described in the Materials and Methods. coli was detected by the pAb against PCV2 ORF5 protein. Lane c to e, the lysates of GST-ORF5-expressing, GST-expressing and blank E.coli were detected by rabbit anti-GST pAb. pAMs infected with each virus were harvested at 12, 24, 36, 48, 72 and 96 h post-infection. viral DNA and virus titers were quantified by real-time PCR and IFA. however, PCV2 replicated at a somewhat reduced rate prior to 36 hpi. these results suggest that the lack of ORF5 protein expression might block viral replication during the early stages of infection. PCV2-infected PAMs were assayed for viral DNA copy number by real-time PCR. expression of ORF1, ORF2, ORF3, ORF4 and ORF5 at the transcriptional level. expression levels of ORF1 and ORF2 transcripts in PCV2-infected cells were significantly lower than those measured in wPCV2-infected cells. PAMs were infected with wild-type PCV2 (wPCV2), recombinant PCV2 (rPCV2) or a start codon mutant PCV2 (PCV2) at an MOI of 1.0. cellular total mRNA was harvested at six time points from 12 to 96 h post infection. pEGFP-ORF5 and pEGFP-C1 plasmids expressed proteins of approximately 33.5 kDa and 27 kDa respectively. as expected, the negative control cells did not produce any immunostaining signal. thereafter, the proliferation of GFP-ORF5-expressing cells and control cells was measured by CCK8 assay. qRT-PCR and western blot assays were used to measure proliferation of 3 103 cells from PAMs transfected with pEGFP-ORF5 and control cells over time. each data set represents the mean SD of three replicates. both the transcription and translation of CycA were significantly down-regulated in pEGFP-ORF5-transfected cells relative to control cells. both the inhibition of CycA transcription and the acceleration of CycA degradation may be responsible for GFP-ORF5-induced S-phase prolongation. the GFP-tagged PCV2 ORF5 protein has no effect on cell apoptosis. the results are mean SD from three independent experiments. the GFP-tagged PCV2 ORF5 protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum. the amount of the IB protein measured from PAMs transfected with pEGFP-ORF5 decreased obviously while the amount of the nuclear p65 protein increased considerably. these findings indicated that GFP-ORF5 induces NF-B activation by promoting degradation of IB and nuclear translocation of p65. inflammatory factors IL-6, IL-8, and COX-2 are tightly regulated by activation of NF-B. mRNA levels of IL-6, IL-8, and COX-2 in GFP-ORF5 expressing cells were significantly higher than in control cells. expression of the protein promoted a relative upregulation of the expression of IL-6, IL-8, and COX-2 expression in PAMs. RNA was extracted from cells expressing either GFP alone, GFP-ORF5 fusion, or untransfected cells. RT-PCR analysis of IL-6, IL-8 and COX-2 mRNA levels were normalized to the corresponding CT value for porcine -actin mRNA. pEGFP-C1 or pEGFP-ORF5 were treated with 10 M MG132. the cells were collected 12 h later and GFP-ORF5 proteins were detected by immunoblotting using anti-GFP antibody. a total of 16 positive clones were rescued, sequenced and analyzed by a BLAST search for homology to human and porcine proteins. number of cDNA clones found Description of cDNA clones and best hits of homolog proteins identified in databases 5 Partial cDNA encoding aa 2\u2013208 of porcine transmembrane glycoprotein NMB precursor (Sus scrofa NP_001092054.1, E value = 2e-69; Homo sapiens NP_001005340.1, E value = 1e-49) yeast strain Y2H was co-transformed with pGBKT7-based bait and pGADT7-based prey plasmids. interaction of the ORF5 protein with the five cellular proteins GPNMB, CYP1A1, YWHAB, ZNF511 and SRSF3 was indicated by growth of blue colonies on QDO/X plates. if possible, the natural existence of ORF5 protein during PCV2 infection needs to be further confirmed by independent experiments. further investigation indicated that ORF5-deficient PCV2 replicates slowly in PAMs. the maximum DNA copies and viral titers are comparable to wPCV2 [21]. iviruses (CSFV NS2 protein and HCV NS2 protein) and coronaviruses (PEDV N protein and SARS-CoV N protein) can induce cell cycle arrest at a particular phase. a recent study showed that PCV2 replication is both S- and G2/M-phase dependent and that CycA expression levels play an important role during the PCV2 life cycle. PCV2 ORF5 activates the NF-B signalling pathway in PK-15 cells. this is consistent with previous results demonstrating that PCV2 infection activates the NF-B signalling pathway in PK-15 cells [53]. the upregulation of IL-6, IL-8 and COX-2 further confirmed this hypothesis. previous work has suggested that PCV2 NS0 is more abundant than PCV1 NS0 and that the differential splicing and relative expression levels of NS0 RNAs may contribute to the pathogenesis of PCV2 [54] contradictory evidence has also shown that introducing a stop codon into NS0 RNA did not have any effect on viral protein synthesis. RNAs transcribed to right (Rep, Rep' and ORF5) are annotated on top of the sequence. initiation codons are in oval circles and termination codons are in boxes."}
