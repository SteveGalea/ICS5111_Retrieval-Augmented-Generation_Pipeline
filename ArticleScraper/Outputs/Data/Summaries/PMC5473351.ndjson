{"summary": "the most common sources of air pollution include particulate matter (PM), ozone, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide [1,3,5,6]. PM can be defined by their different size ranges, including coarse (10 m), fine (2.5 m) and ultrafine particles (UFPs, 100 nm) reductions in PM2.5 were associated with lower premature mortality and improvement in life expectancy. china, india and the middle east countries have shown alarming increases in air pollution, along with increased mortality and disease burden in those countries. despite progress in understanding of air pollution-induced diseases, much research remains to be done. the addition of ceria to diesel fuel resulted in ceria-concentration-dependent emission reductions of CO2, CO, total particulate mass, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acrolein and several polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. however, it also led to decreases in the size of emitted particles and a substantial increase in the number of UFPs. further research is needed to evaluate the risks associated with these tiny particles. a reduction of 10 g/m3 was associated with an increase of 0.61 years in life expectancy. early evidence linking ambient PM to mortality came from well-documented short-term extreme air pollution episodes in the 1930s to 1950s. more than 3.2 million deaths per year could be attributed to outdoor PM2.5 exposure. the majority of the mortality happened in Asia, which strongly influenced the global mortality rate. there are no conclusive data yet available for the human health impacts of ambient ultrafine particles and engineered nanoparticles. the data were derived from a global atmospheric chemistry model linking premature mortality to outdoor air pollution. in 2010, outdoor air pollution leads to 3.3 million premature deaths per year worldwide, predominantly in Asia. children are more susceptible to air pollution because they have smaller airways, higher breathing rates per body mass, immature detoxification and metabolic systems. elderly population and people with chronic diseases are susceptible likely because of less efficient particle clearance in the lung. nano-sized particles could even translocate out of the lung to other tissues and organs, which induce pathological changes in blood, vasculature, heart and brain. iological studies from both developing and developed countries have shown the association between outdoor PM exposure and COPD. an increase in ambient PM2.5 could induce acute exacerbations and mortality from COPD. improvement in air quality decreases the incidence of COPD. two recent epidemiological studies showed associations between air pollution (TRAP and ozone) and acute respiratory infections. a 10-year longitudinal study of 23,704 adults from eight european countries showed an association between TRAP exposure and increased incidence of asthma. outdoor air pollution and PM were classified as a group I carcinogen. this was determined based on the most recent data from human, animal and mechanistic studies. each 10 g/m3 increase in PM1 is associated with 45% increased risk of lung cancer. PM10 is referred to the mass of particles collected with 50% efficiency for particles with an aerodynamic diameter equal to or less than 10 m. at this size range, the mass fraction of inhaled particles could penetrate beyond the larynx to the airways. ultrafine particles are found to a large extent in urban air as both singlet and aggregated particles. studies have shown that UFPs were more toxic than larger counterparts. however, more research is needed to clarify the role of UFPs. NPs and PM including UFPs could both generate ROS or release toxic ions through dissolution. metal fume fever is a real-world example of this toxicity, commonly for welders. Particle type PM2.5 UFPs NPs Size 2.5 m exist alone or as a component of PM2.5 100 nm for at least one dimension Sources Incidental (combustion) Incidental (combustion) Engineered (controlled synthesis) Morphology Irregular (chain-like structure) Regular (sphere, tube, cube, rod, wire, plate, small fraction of particles that could pass through upper airways into the alveolar region could be easily endocytosed and removed by alveolar macrophages. however, for large particles including PM10 and PM2.5, the majority deposited in the upper airways could be removed with the mucociliary escalator. PM2.5 sticks to the airway, where they are cleared by mucociliary escalator. the remaining PM2.5 particles that get inside the alveoli will be phagocytosed by resident macrophages. however, for UFPs and NPs, the majority of the particles will get inside the alveoli. oxidative stress has been identified as a major mechanism for PM10-, PM2.5- and UFP-associated health effects. some NPs, including carbon nanotubes, silver nanoparticles, ZnO, CuO, etc., have also been shown to be able to generate ROS and oxidative stress. oxidative stress hypothesis: Nrf2 interaction with the antioxidant response element leads to heme oxygenase 1 and other phase II enzyme expression at lower levels of oxidative stress. at a intermediary level of oxidative stress, activation of the MAPK and NF-kB signaling cascades can induce pro-inflammatory responses (e.g. cytokine and chemokine production) ocytosis of PM, UFPs and NPs, NADPH oxidase is activated to generate ROS. over-production of mitochondrial ROS could lead to release of mtDNA and cardiolipin. potassium efflux induced by particles could also induce mitochondrial and cellular ROS production leading to NLRP3 inflammasome activation. ultrafine carbon black was selected as the model particle. ultrafine carbon black caused systemic pro-inflammatory responses in the lung. quinones are byproducts of fossil fuel combustion, as well as the conversion of PAH in the lung. OH radical is more reactive than O2 and hydrogen peroxide by several orders of magnitude. transition metals also have the ability to directly perturb the function of the mitochondrial permeability transition (PT) pore [24,44,60] inducing factor (AIF), etc., are released into the cytosol where they activate a number of apoptotic pathways, ultimately leading to programmed cell death [18,24,44,48,60,62]. cellular oxidative stress can generate a wide range of responses that can be experimentally detected. oxidative stress can generate a wide range of responses that can be experimentally detected, including damaged DNA. physicochemical characteristics of NPs that may have health implications include particle size, shape, surface characteristics and functionality. future screening could also include DNA damage and mutagenesis tests to assess their carcinogenic potential. NP composition or modification may affect particle surface reactivity such as the ability to generate ROS. a recent study found that ceO2 NPs could lead to a decrease in cell viability. this case, ceO2 NP exposure leads to autophagy and inhibition of autophagy partially reverses cell death by ceO2 NPs. pulmonary exposure of ZnO nanoparticles could lead to transient increases in acute lung inflammation. toxicity of ZnO depends on particle dissolution property and shedding of toxic Zn ions, which induce oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory effects in vitro and in vivo [58,68,71]. lysosomal protein cathepsin B activates NLRP3 inflammasome and produces IL-1. IL-1 plays a major role in inflammation and fibrosis by activating epithelial mesenchymal transition in the lung. other long-aspect-ratio ENMs also showed similar effects. biotransformation of REOs could lead to dephosphorylation of phospholipids on the lysosomal membrane, leading to lysosomal damage. released cathepsin B from lysosomes to the cytosol will activate NLRP3 inflammasomes to produce IL-1. this leads to accumulation of activated NLRP3 inflammasomes because autophagy is the major homeostatic mechanism to remove activated inflammasome toxicological approach with the goal of linking particle physicochemical properties to their toxic effects [18,48,53] there are five major requirements to establish this predictive toxicological paradigm. the first is to comprehensively characterize their physicochemical properties that may lead to biological injury. the second requirement is to develop in vitro cellular screening assays that reveal particle-induced injury mechanisms. UFPs and NPs may be more potent in causing adverse health effects in humans because of their high deposition rate in the alveolar region, impaired clearance by alveolar macrophages and higher surface reactivity. therefore, it is imperative to focus future research on the health effects of nano-scale pollutants so preventive strategies and regulatory guidelines can be developed."}
