{"summary": "women\u2019s health and disease news articles were collated from a popular news website between 1993 to 2015. the resultant articles were preprocessed using gynecological medical terminology, Korean words and nouns. the resultant articles (N = 7,710) were analyzed using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm and major topics were extracted. studies on health-related articles focused on only 1 health-related issue. in 2008 Jung analyzed the news framing journalism perspectives of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and human immunodeficiency virus in the 1990s. the concept of framing expands the research by focusing on the essence of the issues at hand rather than on a particular topic. text mining is a type of big data analysis methodology for discovering abstract topics that repeatedly occur in a collection of documents. textual documents and time series can be mined concurrently to predict the movements of stock prices based on the contents of news articles. the results of the present study may be used as basic data for effective introduction of women\u2019s health policies and financial management. the results of the present study may be used as basic data for effective introduction of women\u2019s health policies and financial management. 3 search terms were used to collect online news articles in a test search. analysis revealed that search terms \u201cwomen disease\u201d and \u201cwomen illness\u201d were not satisfactory because more advertising articles were retrieved than news articles. in the present study, the number of topics was extracted and analyzed from 5 to 30 to determine the appropriate number. the top 20 most frequent words were extracted for each topic using the collapsed Gibbs sampling technique. in step 2, the saved data were preprocessed using the LDA algorithm. in step 4, the major topics of health-related online news were extracted from the LDA analysis. article titles and full-text were extracted after removing irrelevant text. the number of total collected articles was 7,710. the articles had been published over a 23-year period between 1993 to 2015. the top 20 most frequent words were extracted for each topic using the collapsed Gibbs sampling technique. the number of topics was set at 10, taking into account interpretability and meaningfulness. in the present study, the number of
