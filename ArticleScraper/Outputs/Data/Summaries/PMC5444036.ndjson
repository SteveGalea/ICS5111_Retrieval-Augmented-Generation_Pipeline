{"summary": "seven patients presented with multiple evanescent white dot syndrome (MEWDS) within a 3-month period in central Israel. data collected from patients' medical records on clinical, multimodal imaging, and viral serology findings. results Six women and one man of mean age 31.5 7.2 years. a prodromal flu-like illness has been reported in up to 50% of cases. one report described a patient with elevated levels of total serum IgG during the disease course and negative findings for IgM to herpes zoster, herpes simplex, mumps, and measles. the volume scan option was used to acquire multiple SD-OCT scans (25\u201349 horizontal scans over a 6 mm region covering the area of pathology) the dual-beam laser eye-tracking system enabled rescanning in areas of interest. spectralis follow-up function automatically places subsequent scans on the same location as the previous ones. three patients reported a prodromal virus infection. the best corrected visual acuity ranged from 6/9 to 6/30 in the affected eye. tab 22-year-old female with visual acuity of 6/20 in her left eye. FA of the left eye shows mild optic disc leakage at late phase (4 min 56 seconds) SD-OCT shows disrupted ellipsoid zone more pronounced at the fovea. OCTA was performed following convalescence stage; VA: visual acuity of affected eye; BAF: blue autofluorescence; IR: indocyanine green; OCTA: optical coherence tomography angiography; EZ: ellipsoid zone. 3.2. multimodal imaging Findings Patients who underwent imaging less than 2 weeks from onset of symptoms had most typical findings. ICGA images corresponded to the areas of disruption of the ellipsoid zone, on the SD-OCT scans. FA demonstrated nonspecific early punctate hyperfluorescent lesions, with slight staining during the early phase, in four patients (patients 2, 3, 6, and 7) these lesions did not correspond to the findings by either the clinical or other imaging modalities. patients 6 and 7 underwent imaging with OCT angiography at convalescence stage. patients 7's right eye (a-b) and 6's left eye (c-d) showed no flow impairment in retinal and choroidal vasculature. the best corrected visual acuity ranged from 6/6 to 6/6.6 (Table 2). 3.1. Demographics and Clinical Findings There were one male and six female patients of mean age 31.5 7.2 years (range 22\u201341 years) FA of the left eye shows mild optic disc leakage. SD-OCT shows disrupted ellipsoid zone more pronounced at the fovea. BAF revealed hyperautofluorescent lesions in the macula between and along the arcades in four patients (patients 1, 3, 6, and 7) IR photos showed dark lesions in similar, though not identical locations. patients 1 and 6 who underwent ICGA had hypofluorescent lesions in numbers typically exceeding those detected by both clinical and other imaging modalities. no pathology was noted in the foveal area despite the presence of typical foveal granularity. no pathology was noted despite the presence of typical foveal granularity. patients 6 and 7 underwent imaging with OCT angiography at convalescence stage. patients 7's right eye (a-b) and 6's left eye (c-d) OCTA findings demonstrated no flow impairment in the retinal and choroidal vasculature. the atypical presentation in most of our patients could suggest that MEWDS is underdiagnosed. however, it may be in line with the speculation that sometimes atypical findings may simply reflect the moment in time in which the patients were examined. IR and the BAF findings faded in concurrence with the anatomical resolution of the disruption in the ellipsoid zone and the foveal hyperreflective lesion on SD-OCT. IR images may provide an easy, widely available imaging modality for follow-up of patients with MEWDS. OCTA findings showed no flow impairment in retinal and choroidal vasculature of patients scanned after convalescence stage. the clinical signs of MEWDS are subtle, such that the diagnosis relies on a high index of suspicion."}
