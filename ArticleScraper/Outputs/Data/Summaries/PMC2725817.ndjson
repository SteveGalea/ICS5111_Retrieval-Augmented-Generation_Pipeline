{"summary": "the study participants were children 10 years of age who were hospitalized from November 3, 2005, to April 3, 2006. all children were admitted 2\u20136 days after the onset of ARTI. sequences of canine minute virus (MVC) and bovine parvovirus (BPV) were used as the outgroup. a TaqMan real-time PCR targeting the NS1 region of HBoV was conducted. two HBoV-positive patients (patient 7 and patient 10) had coinfection with human coronavirus 229E. the most common clinical signs and symptoms were cough (86%), fever (33%), wheezing (33%), and diarrhea (29%). most HBoV-positive patients had no other underlying illness, with exception of 1 (patient 3) who had intracranial infection. clonism NR 4.3 104 5 (M) 10 15 BP Cough BA-ILM 2.5 1010 6 (F) 2 2 BP Dyspnea, cyanosis RLZ-AS 4.7104 7 (M) 4 11 BP Cough, diarrhea BA-ILM 1.6 105 (1.2 105) 8 (M) 120 10 P Fever, cough BA-ILM 4.4 104 9 (M) 9 19 B Cough, wheeze NR HBoV viral loads in NPA specimens ranged from 2.4 104 to 2.5 1010 copies/mL. most specimens had HBoV viral loads close to 104 copies/mL. but 5 (24%) NPA specimens had viral loads >109 copies/mL. phylogenetic trees were constructed by the neighbor-joining method. bootstrap values were determined by 1,000 replicates. the sequences generated from the present study were deposited in GenBank. the viral loads in serum specimens were similar to those from HBoV-positive patients who had both serum and NPA specimens. in our study, 29% of patients had diarrhea, which was also reported in 16% of HBoV\u2013positive patients in the united states (10)."}
