{"summary": "the ratio of young to old people in germany is shifting towards the elderly. we used selected diseases or therapies as a proxy for blood supply. results The number of persons older than 65 years will rise from by about 30% until 2030. patient blood management (PBM) is a comprehensive initiative in quality management focused on improving patients outcome by diagnosing and treating preoperative and perioperative anaemia. the ICC PBM took place in Frankfurt/Main, Germany on April 24, 24 and 25, 2018. the centre for evidence-based practice (CEBaP) developed search strategies in four different biomedical databases. CEBaP screened approx. 18,000 papers and included more than 140 relevant papers within the three PBM topics. results Consensus statements with the supporting evidence will be presented during the lectures. DTDB has collected data on transfusions, diagnoses, and biochemical tests since 2000. the first annual report was published in 2002. DTDB is now undergoing reprocessing; hence the last report was published in 2016. partial D indicates qualitative changes of the antigen with epitope loss. 82.3% carry it in almost normal strength (\u00abRhD positive\u00bb) the remaining donors possess weakly expressed or variant proteins. anti-D anti-D immunization in D positives was much rarer than immunization to some other blood group antigens. new techniques are emerging (molecular typing without serologic information) and entering widespread use (fetal typing from maternal blood) surface CD71 expression and ECP inhibition can be detected as early as 7\u201316h after ECP in contrast to the laborious CFSE-assay that needs a minimum culture time of 4\u20135 days. expression of CD11b had a tendency to rise over the period of 48 h. time to unstimulated ROS production on slides was unchanged by storage. NETosis response time was found not to be affected by prolonged storage. four working groups discussed examples of solutions for implementation of GAMP5 and GMP Guide in the routine for hospitals, transfusion facilities, as well as medical facilities. the first solutions for illustration in the guideline are to be presented and discussed. Ziele Qualifizierung und Validierung der Roche Cobas 8800/ 6800 PCR Automaten an den Standorten Frankfurt, Plauen und Ulm, Qualifizierung und Validierung der ABBOTT Alinity S Analyzer an den Standorten Frankfurt und Plauen und Qualifizierung und Validierung der Roche Cobas e801 Module am Standort Frankfurt Methoden \u00dcber ein geregeltes Change Control Verfahren bei dem sowohl der Projektplan und die Risikoanalyse die Grundelemente f\u00fcr die Qualifikation und Validierung dar the irradiation of blood preparations is intended to prevent a graft-versus-host reaction from immunocompetent residual leukocytes in blood preparations in immuno-incompetent specimen recipients. the radiation device with source of an X-ray tube \u00abQuaStar X-ray Tube\u00bb is to be established in the institute Berlin, Hindenburgdamm in the future for the irradiation of blood products (Abb. 1). irradiation of preparastions is more homogeneous Lower requirements with regard to radiation protection The risk of a terrorist attack is lower. irradiation with X-ray tube as radiation source is equally good with regard to the equivalent dose. devices is defined for each site in the enterprise network. results After successfully assessing the accuracy, precision, linearity, and reproducibility in the central laboratory of the group of companies. a chimeric gene was fused to the CDS of a mutant FKBP12 protein destruction domain, rapidly leading to the degradation of the fusion protein. after complete selection and outgrowth of Shield1 treated iTF expressing progenitor cells, the inducible transcription factor (iTF) was stabilized. our study aims to establish culture conditions that allow for the differentiation of K562 cells into enucleated erythroid cells. the duffy FyB receptor was stably introduced into the K562 by lentiviral gene transfer. the duffy receptor expression was already higher in clone C26a-30a. the duffy receptor expression was stable in stimulated cells of the clone. co-cultivation with macrophages did not further enhance the MIT-induced hemoglobin production. the new protocol further led to a homogenous 98% GPA positive population with a remarkably high mean enucleation rate of 40%. formation of blistered EBs stromal layers seemed crucial to gain these results. IAT was performed using the micro-column gel card (ID-LISS/Coombs, BioRad) plasmas with previously identified red blood cell antibodies of different specificities were titrated to a minimal reactivity of +1. samples of daratumumab treated patients were tested to confirm the results in \u00abreal life\u00bb material. Daratumumab is the first anti-CD38 antibody approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma. more patients benefit from this new therapy, but it has become an increasing challenge for blood bankers to supply these patients with compatible red blood cell concentrates. antibody screening tests were similarly performed using untreated, DTT-treated, or DaraEx-treated test erythrocytes. results Out of 12 samples, 11 had weakly positive cross-matches with untreated donor RBC (a), 2 were still positive using the DTT method (b) and all were negative in the DaraEx method (c) fusion protein containing extracellular domain of CD38 was expressed in mammalian cells, purified and concentrated as soluble CD38. anti-CD38 spiked donor plasma (containing alloantibodies or not) were mixed and incubated for 15 minutes at 37\u00b0C. sCD38 allows identification of a mixture of anti-Fya and anti-Cob antibodies in the presence of anti-CD38 in plasma. results show inhibition of therapeutic plasma concentrations of daratumumab using a novel highly concentrated sCD38 at small volumes without interference in the detection of irregular antibodies. antibodies digested for 16 hrs at 37\u00b0C using immobilized papain. column was centrifuged, washed with 100 l PBS and flow-throughs pooled and stored at 20\u00b0C. dara-Fab (15 l) prevented red blood cell agglutination by plasma spiked with daratumumab for all concentrations. 15 l dara-Fab could override daratumumab-induced panreactivity. serological investigations were performed for a median follow up of 28 days (range 1\u2013483) and 176 days (range: 3\u2013218) after administration of daratumumab and isatuximab. all interferences could be negated using DTT-treated red blood cells. haemolysis is solely attributed to antibody and/or complement-mediated destruction and clearance of RBCs. Eryptosis is the suicidal death of red blood cells similar to apoptosis of nucleated cells. it has been unknown whether eryptosis may play a role in AIHA. the large european collaborate study is in the process of developing hyperimmune anti-HPA-la IgG (NAITgam) for the prevention of HPA-la immunization and fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (FNAIT) in HPA-la positive children born by HPA-la negative women. the ability of NAITgam to eliminate HPA-la positive platelets transfused to HPA-la negative healthy individuals will be tested in the targeted populations of HLA A2 or HLA A9 positive platelets were identified in a dot plot using FITC conjugated anti-HLA A2,28 IgG2a or anti-HLA A9 IgG2b monoclonal antibodies. parameters to be validated were: selectivity, carry-over, lower limit of detection (LLOQ), calibration curve, accuracy, precision, and robustness. the population of mature MK was defined as CD41 and CD42b double positive by flow cytometry (FC) the ploidy state of the cells was determined after propidium iodide (PI) staining. the changes in glycan pattern were assessed by FC using lectins. plasmapheresis(PP) started in the transfusion medicine as a manual procedure and has made great progress in the automated version for the last 40 years. this reflect the number of plasma donations as preparative plasmapheresis(PPP) of all blood donations, the quality of the produced plasma and the technical development of automated plasma separators. the results of the PEI-data in 2017 demonstrates that 38% of all blood donations in Germany were plasma donations. 66.9% of the collected PfF was Source Plasma(SP) from PPP. the goal of national SS has never been achieved in MS with strong activities on PP like Netherlands, France and Italy using a non compensated plasma donation. material & Methods 6667 donors with IgG caused deferrals from an 8-year period (2001\u20132009) were selected from the donor data base. three IgG-levels were extracted: IgG at the first donation (IgG1), IgG at the first control after expired deferral period (IgG3) and IgG at the first control after expired deferral period (IgG3) only donors with initial IgG lower than acceptable also excluded. \u201310 g/L \u00e0 1/week > 10 g/L \u00e0 2/week Individualized deferral rules and times are required according to IgG2 levels (at deferral) to avoid unnecessary donor deferral, to allow donations according to the donor capacities. the donation rate for plasma donations is highly dependent on the donor IgG & TP concentrations. the TP showed an analogous behavior in the short term, but in the long term a level decrease in both groups. the general regeneration effect is not significant in the long term. group I consisted of whole blood donors (4 donations per year at most) group II included low frequency plasma donors (maximal 10 plasma donations per anno) group III and IV included donors with a higher frequency of plasma donations. donors of group IV frequently donate plasma for more than 5 years. long-time plasma donors with more than 11 plasmapheresis sessions per year showed a decrease in TP and an increase in bone metabolism markers pointing towards activated bone turnover. further studies on a larger blood donor cohort are of high interest, including analysis of bone mineral density. an average of about 158 mL citrate was used for the plasma donation. about 133 mL citrate went into the product, 26 mL into the donor. a total volume loss of 473 mL of TBW (about 1%) was found. an alternative to pathogen reduction methods could be the implementation of a bacterial screening method. ATP measurement, BacTx, BacT/ALERT, Bactiflow, FACS, NAT, Haemonetic eBDS, Scansystem, Spetifast and Verax PGD were compared with each other. a new tab Conflict of interest none Background The risk and importance of transfusion-transmitted hepatitis E virus infections by contaminated blood products is currently a controversial discussed topic in transfusion medicine. the infectious dose remains an unknown quantity. more than 70 transfusion-transmitted cases have been reported indicating an importance of HEV also in blood transfusion. the working party proposed a minipool screening in pools of 96 (sensitivity of 2000 IU/ml) but not required for the release of blood components. in 11,589 donations tested in pools of 16 three HEV RNA positive donations were identified. from 1\u201d248 donations tested in minipools of 12 one positive donation was identified. there are still several points which need to be clarified related to the implementation of this additional molecular screen. a screening of postmortal tissue donors for antibodies of hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus and Treponema pallidum in the blood is mandatory. a preanalytical testing of the blood sample would be helpful. a careful selection of an inactivation technique and its profound validation are necessary. the objective of this study is to determine if CLIC1 supports cell adhesive processes that are relevant for endothelial proliferation. a significant increase of cell surface CLIC1 in 5 day old platelet concentrates suggesting increased platelet activation at the end of their shelf life. a sensitivity of platelets to adenosin diphosphate (ADP) has been suggested to contribute to a hypercoagulable state in MPN through increased thrombin generation. in vitro thrombin generation in platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and platelet-poor plasma (PPP) was assessed using the Calibrated Automated Thrombogram (CAT) assay. a higher ADP-induced peak thrombin concentration (Cpeak) was observed in MPN patients. the activity of the prothrombinase complex is not up-regulated by MPN-associated alterations of the resting platelet membrane. for this reason, a sensitive and easy-to-use method to determine platelet activation in whole blood is necessary. a slightly but not significant increase of CD45 signal was observed using ADP. no difference in cytometric signal measured directly or 3 days after fixation for platelet activation with TRAP. patients were divided into 2 groups: I. with HAD (ECMO or ECLS) and II. without HAD-implementation. inclusion criteria were a positive rapid immunoassay and an intermediate to high pretest probability of HIT (4Ts score 4). sera from both groups were tested by the functional assay, HIPA (Heparin-induced platelet Activation) mAb IV.3 may help distinguish antibody-mediated platelet activation from unspecific reaction in the functional assay. macrophages play an important role in hemophilia, which is associated with delayed tissue regeneration and bleeding-induced joint inflammation. a functioning coagulation system promotes the regenerative capacity of macrophages in normal macrophages. monocytes were embedded in clotted plasma in the presence of cytokine leptin. this suggests that a functioning coagulation system promotes the regenerative capacity of macrophages in normal macrophages. highly adhesive U87MG and U373MG glioblastoma cells invade and sprout after embedding in 3D matrices of clotted plasma and fibrin. poorly adhesive cells failed to invade and sprout in 3D blood clot even though they readily proliferate in conventional 2D culture plates. real-time deformability cytometry (RT-DC) is a label-free functional platelet assay based on cell mechanical properties. RT-DC allows for a clear differentiation between RT and 4 \u00b0C stored plates. the cytoskeleton of 4 \u00b0C stored platelets was assessed to be rapidly degraded. this strongly indicates that cold stored platelets might increase the risk for micro-thromboembolism. RT-DC allows capturing underlying alterations in the platelet cytoskeleton after day 1. PLT activation was determined measuring the expression of CD62P and CD63 after storage by FC. s was investigated performing an aggregation assay using a 4-channel-aggregometer and collagen as inductor. we performed an extended study to assess cold-stored platelet concentrates produced under standard care GMP conditions. we found that platelet function was better compared to those stored at room temperature. this suggests cold storage of PLTs in PAS may become a suitable alternative to the current standard of care. concentrations of DKK-1, CCL5, TGF1 and TSP-1 increased to two-fold more in RT PCs than in CS PCs. the frequency of detectable CRP concentrations was significantly higher in PPCs than APCs and in RT PCs than in CS PCs. this could possibly be a new approach to reduce transfusion-associated adverse events in neonates. females showed no significant difference in return rates between the CG and QG. the intervention of research with FTDs after their first donation resulted in an increased return rate in male but not in female donors. the conventional shotgun-like analyses (preTAILS) unraveled a stable general proteome of platelets after blood donation. however, the TAILS analyses provided a total of 276 peptides with twofold changed abundance after blood donation. in 2014, participants judged eight potential incentives for blood donation as acceptable or not. the incentives were refreshments (e.g. coffee), physical check-ups (e.g. blood pressure), free testing, free medical treatment, non-cash items (e.g. first aid kits), monetary travel reimbursements, cash amounts additionally to reimbursements. conflict of interest none Objective Antibodies against human neutrophil (HNA) and leukocyte (HLA) antigens can lead to transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) frequency of alloimmunization against HNA and HLA was found to be very high in female donors. 19217 apheresis platelet concentrates were transfused after the implementation of this screening strategy. no fatale TRALI has been reported. s were leukoreduced and analyzed for in vitro characteristics of metabolism, hemolysis and microparticles during storage at 4 \u00b0C at days 1, 14, 35, 42, 49. additional 12 RBCs were irradiated at day 10 with 30 Gy. PCs showed equivalent outcomes regarding platelet count, metabolism, hypotonic shock response, aggregation and activation response. DINCH based blood containers are promising candidate substitutes for DEHP blood containers. the plasticiser di-2-ethylhexylphthalate (DEHP) is added to blood bags to keep the bags soft and flexible. the DEHP improves the storage quality of the RBCs. the formation of stomatocytes is associated with the expansion of the inner leaflet relative to the outer leaflet. the formation of stomatocytes appears to be mediated by the action of DEHP as a synthetic scramblase, mixing up lipids from the inner and outer leaflets. ddPCR was performed by amplification of rHCE-specific exon 3 and SPEF1 sequences as internal control. no discrepancies were observed by enumeration of rWBC using leucoCount and ddPCR. study population consisted of 12 heterozygous FVL carriers with a history of unprovoked venous thromboembolism (VTE+) and 13 without (VTE-) none of the subjects was under anticoagulant treatment. plasma levels of free thrombin and APC were quantified using oligonucleotide-based enzyme capture assays. after rFVIIa injection, from 0.63 (0.54\u20131.16) to 2.94 (2.52\u20133.57) pmol/L (p = 1.4 104) in the controls, from 1.48 (1.23\u20132.05) to 7.98 (7.39\u201312.68) pmol/L (p = 3 105) in the VTE+ cohort, and from 1.27 (1.00\u20131.52) to 5.28 (4.61\u20137.68) pmol/L (p = 2.8 105) in PCs were spiked with bacteria (enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis Pseudomonas fluorescens, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus bovis) for inactivation kinetics, two PCs were pooled and inoculated with bacteria to a final concentration of approximately 0.3 CFU/mL. PCs treated by THERAFLEX UV-Platelet system remained sterile during storage for 7 days. bacteria grew to high titers of 106\u201310 9 CFU/mL in non-treated PCs. results suggest UVC-based pathogen inactivation technology can significantly improve the bacterial safety of platelet transfusions. PCs (n = 6, 350 mL) were then UVC-irradiated on the Macotronic UV machine (Macopharma) samples were taken after spiking (load and hold sample) and after illumination with different light doses. the titre of FCV was determined as tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) by endpoint titration in microtitre plate assays on feline kidney cell line CRFK. if PI may reduce therapeutic efficacy of frozen plasma, we compared the influence of PI techniques on factor I and factor VIII, clotting time, clot stability after 30 minutes (A30) and endogen thrombin potential (ETP) in comparison to untreated plasma. ETP in nmol/min was comparable and not significantly different between all groups. clotting time and ETP combined with a higher clotting amplitude after 30 minutes(A30) for inactivated plasma demonstrates that remaining coagulability of those plasma units is sufficient for clinical use. anti-HBc positive findings were confirmed by anti-HBc neutralisation test using recombinant HBcAg. 62/78 anti-HBc positive donors were reassessed using archived samples. infections with HDV occur only as co-infection in line with a hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. HBsAg is an integral part of the surface of HDV and essential for host cell entry. in nine out of 167 anti-HBc true positive donors, four could not be tested for anti-HDV due to lack of material. no HBsAg and/or HBV DNA were detectable in these seven donors. new alleles included 202 HLA class I (55 HLA-A, 69 HLA-B, 78 HLA-C) and 105 HLA class II (52 HLA-DPB1, 24 HLA-DQB1, 25 HLA-DRB1, 1 HLA-DRB3, 3 HLA-DRB4) variants. splicing defect occurring from nucleotide changes 1 to 5 bases apart from the exon boundary. the majority of these new alleles carry single nucleotide alterations in introns 1, 2, 3 or 4. whole blood, blood components, lyophilized plasma and some blood products are used. there is no uniform agreement on the optimal treatment yet. 164,404 patients received a total number of 725.709RBCs. the total annual number of RBC units increased since 2004 (43.263 units) reaching a plateau from 2009 until 2013(49.000) the number of transfused RBC units correlatesstrong with the number of persons in the age groups 65\u201369, 70\u201374 an 75\u201379. the number of diagnosis prone to receive a RBC-transfusion is also dependent on the number of persons within the population. the results can be grouped by Major Diagnostic Categories (MDCs) and by basic DRGs. between 2010 and 2017, we observed a 17-percent decline of the number of annually transfused RBCs. this decrease was almost exclusively restricted to inpatients whose diagnoses and procedures were grouped to the MDC 0. invasive procedures (e.g. amniocentesis) are often conduced to obtain fetal cells. maternal blood is used to extract cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from the plasma. different methods, mostly based on realTime-PCR, have been developed for the detection of fetal DNA in maternal cfDNA. assays were tested on cfDNA by typing of samples with known homozygous and heterozygous genotypes. each test resulted in approx. 20,000 evaluable signals and up to 0.05 % of the signals were false positive. DNA from maternal samples was isolated with the PureGene Kit. total DNA was amplified in a multiplex PCR with fluorogenic primers. negative mothers are at increased risk of fetal anemia and potentially fetal loss. the standard treatment consists of intrauterine transfusion. however, this treatment is associated with relevant procedure related risks. fetal death could not be prevented in one case with distinct fetal hydrops five hours after an IUT in gestational week 28. no signs of fetal anemia have yet been observed in the remaining fourth case. severity of FNAIT was compared between compatible and incompatible pregnancies. no statistically significant difference in distribution of ABO phenotypes among immunized women, neonates and controls. a, 1 case Anti-HPA-15a were treated with IVIG every week without additional corticosteroid therapy. fetal incompatibility was determined by assessing cell-free fetal DNA from maternal plasma and subsequent fetal genotyping before starting IVIG administration. graft versus leukaemia (GvL) effect is mediated by NK cells that express inhibitory killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) missing their corresponding HLA ligand in the patient. sorted KIR+ NK cells showed lytic activity and higher degranulation activity against KIR-HLA matched target cells compared to bulk NK cells. this technology allows sorting of alloreactive KIR+ NK cells by negative isolation of all KIR-expressing NK cells. donor distribution for haploidentical or HLA-matched family (FD), HLA-matched stem cell (SCD) and unrelated haploidentical T-cell registry donors was very similar. flow cytometry analyses on WBC counts, viability and IFN-+ positive T-cells. antiviral T-cells became detectable in 80% of the patients after transfer. FD might be slightly inferior to other donor groups. cyclophosphamide (metrCyc) will be used to deplete regulatory T-cells (Treg) the DC-vaccine is injected intra-dermally four times in weekly intervals. the vaccination response will be boosted by intradermal application of glioma lysate. non-irradiated or irradiated iPSC-derived MKs were analysed for polyploidy, phenotype and proPLT production. results Differentiation of MKs in presence of microcarriers resulted in a 8-fold increase of MKs per iPSC in comparison to only aggregates. rradiation of MKs did not affect their phenotype and capability to form proPLTs or PLTs after transfusion into NOD/SCID/IL-2Rc\u2013/\u2013 mice. this may facilitate the use of iPSC-derived MK for ex vivo production of PLTs, direct transfusion or for innovative MK-based regenerative therapies. a 2nd generation CAR was designed by cloning of T\u00dc165 scFv into a CAR backbone with CD3 and 4\u20131BB signaling domains. short (12AA) and long (229AA) extracellular spacer domains were tested. functionality of engineered T cells in response to target cell recognition was determined using a new outgrowth assay. es in a TCR-like manner enable engineered T cells to effectively respond to target cells expressing EBV-restricted, PTLD-associated antigens. patients treated with mTOR inhibitor, e.g. sirolimus, may exhibit favorable outcomes of CMV infection following transplantation. flow-cytometric analysis using monoclonal anti-HLA antibodies (mAbs) provides a stable and feasible platform for monitoring chimerism in antigen-specific T cells. PBMCs from HLA-A01+/02- (donor 1, D1) and A01-/02+ (donor 2, D2) donors were restimulated with CMVpp65 peptide pool. analysis by STR PCR showed similar HLA distributions. sensitivity was proven to be comparable to the STR PCR chimerism analysis. SLA I was permanently silenced during normothermic ex vivo perfusion. lentivirally transduced non-specific shRNA was used in both groups. grafts silenced for MHC I expression are immunologically invisible. platelet factor 4 (PF4) plays an important role in innate immunity. antibodies recognizing a neoepitope on PF4/polyanion (P) complexes opsonize bacteria via binding to PF4 bound to bacterial surface polyanions. anti-PF4/P-antibodies activating platelets only in the presence of polyanions show much higher binding forces 100pN. PF4/P antibodies mediate an innate bacterial defense mechanism. glycan modification of GPs induced by AAbs from ITP sera was analyzed using lectin binding assay (LBA) the impact of PLT desialylation was confirmed in vivo using the NOD mouse model. the injection of ITP AAbs resulted in accelerated clearance of human PLTs from the mouse circulation. 2,000 donors were screened for 37 blood group, 10 HPA and 10 HNA antigens. allele frequencies were similar to non-Finnish Europeans in the ExAC database except for the S, HPA-3b and HNA-4b antigens. the miSeq system (Illumina) enables typing of 768 donors in parallel. results 768 DNA samples were typed in parallel, coming to 25,344 PCR amplicons. 80 of these reactions failed or gave low reads for data analysis. VEL genotypes and 1 discrepant YT genotype were found to be correctly typed by the new NGS method. the new test system was found to be suitable, reliable, and cost effective. a total of 25 platelet samples (2.4%) showed a CD36 negative phenotype in flow cytometry. another eight samples (0.8%) had borderline MFI values. the molecular reason for the CD36 negative phenotype on platelets in these cases could not be finally elucidated. a multi-center study has been undertaken to gain further insights into the molecular basis of the HNA-2null phenotype and the differential neutrophil subsets. a total of 64 samples with HNA-2 negative or questionable phenotype from 9 centers were analyzed in this study. cDNA samples with a positive neutrophil subset of more than 40% preferentially exclusively carried the WT, whereas samples with a lower proportion of positive neutrophils predominantly were heterozygous. some cases remain unresolved. deletions in predefined S\u2013s\u2013U\u2013 samples revealed deletions exact molecular positions. deletions were used to design specific diagnostic PCRs using sequence-specific priming (PCR-SSP) overall haplotype-frequency was estimated to be 11.0%, consistent with the 1.2% S\u2013s\u2013U\u2013 phenotype frequency reported in black africans. hemizygous involvement of such GYPB deletions may be expected in about 19.5% of all black Americans. the mother, father, a healthy brother, and the boy (extended trio) were examined by exome sequencing by NGS. this showed that the boy was compound heterozygotic with two variants in the erythrocytic spectrin alpha 1 gene, a very rare missense mutation, and a novel stop mutation. clinical side effects were observed in 63/316 autologous procedures (20%) and included citrate reactions (n = 5), vasovagal reactions and/or nausea (n = 15), pain (n = 35), and agitation (n = 8). side effects were recorded in 50/105 procedures (48%) and included citrate reactions (n = 15), vasovagal reactions and/or nausea (n = 15), pain (n = 20), and agitation (n = 8). sensitivity of antibiotic chemotherapy was tested automatically by the VITEK 2 XL device. 65.8% of samples were contaminated with gram-positive bacteria. 41.6% of CB samples contained gram-negative bacteria. antibiotic sensitivity testing methods were performed. the classification of CSLI criteria was applied. the use of contaminated CB samples in cellular research needs validation of efficient antibiotic protocols. umbilical cord blood (CB) is used for treatment of more than 80 different diseases. the number of CB stem cells is limited due to the low blood volume and therefore mainly used in pediatrics. data referring to acute GvHD are available for all 51 patients including 31 without a reaction or grade I. 20 patients experienced acute GvHD grade II, among them 7 showed grade III. survival probability depends on the MRD status. tumor cells were detected in apheresis and in the corresponding bone marrow. apheresis procedure may work as a kind of purging. Luminometry allows for quantification of cellular ATP. it has been suggested as an alternative tool to investigate proliferation potential of HPCs in grafts. HALO-CFU-GM, -CFU-MK, -BFU-E and -CFU-GEMM were highly correlated. graft quality parameters CD34+ HPCs and ATP measured with HALO-GEMM significantly affected WBC and MK reconstitution in univariate analysis. the mini-ECP with 100\u2013200 ml of whole blood was used to treat 14 patients. the median age at start of treatment was 7 years (range, 1\u201317 years), the median body weight 20kg (range, 8\u201353kg). a total of 703 mini-ECP treatments were performed. GB1 (10ng/ml, 60ng/ml, 300ng/ml), THBD (100ng/ml, 300ng/ml) and THPO (150ng/ml, 450ng/ml) in physiological (PTCH) concentrations for different times to analyse the effect on proliferation, migration and cytokine secretion of MSC. PTCH, PTCL or IL1B stimulation led to significant up- or downregulation of 470, IL1B stimulation and PTCH stimulation induced secretion of IL6, CXCL1, CXCL8, VEGFA, MMP1, MMP2 and MMP10 in a similar way. RNA sequencing as well as cytokine secretion profile of MSC revealed that IL1B mimics the effect of a more complex PT cocktail. therefore, IL1B stimulation of MSC might be a valid in vitro model to investigate the role of MSC in trauma proliferating tumour cells in vitro possess platelet receptors. primary cells in vitro also develop such receptors upon entering the cell cycle. these receptors gradually disappear when the primary cell lines end their log phase of cell growth. lysed platelets were thawed for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C. released soluble factors from lysed platelets were obtained by 10 minute centrifugation at about 5000 g. activity of HPL was measured by assessing the proliferation of HeLa cells cultured in DMEM. clinical application is considered safe. Thromboembolism and instant blood-mediated inflammatory reactions have been reported as minor side effects. previous studies focusing on plasmatic coagulation described both pro- and anticoagulatory activities of MSCs. adenosinergic pathway emerges as key mechanism by which MSCs exert hemostatic and immunomodulatory functions. replacement of the joint often remains the only possibility to overcome immobility, causing high costs for hospitalization and rehabilitation therapy. the cell count of 2 SVF was out of specification and 9 lipoaspirates and one culture were tested positive for bacterial contamination. despite SVF was negative in 8 cases with microbial contamination of the lipoaspirate, cell culture was stopped. doses of 10 106 ASC were successful, as far as lipoaspirate passed microbial testing and allowed the harvest of up to 298 106 ASC. implementation of further corrective actions to reduce contamination remains a key challange. immunomodulatory potential MSC were plated in 24-well plates 24h prior to co-culture with PBMC from healthy donors. each MSC donor was analyzed by co-culture assays with PBMC from at least 2 donors. the aim of the present study is to recruit and retain donors for multiple, ideally long-term regular donations. even among repeatedly active voluntary blood donors, a substantial fraction does not return for further donations. the study was to assess underlying reasons for not returning for another donation. online survey is being conducted in Germany from April through September 2018. participants are asked to report type and year of donation, time to symptoms onset, and whether they had to undergo medical treatment in an outpatient / inpatient setting. participants are asked to assess the severity (non-serious) of the experienced adverse reaction as well as the quality of informed consent. more than 600 blood donors with a migration background have been recruited for a blood cell donation in this project. a number of ten Fy(a-b-) donors were found, which corresponds to a percentage of 1.6%. study aims to close this research gap by collecting quantitative data from whole blood donors to measure attributions of guilt. genetically caused illnesses lead to the highest willingness to donate blood whereas behaviorally caused illnesses lead to the lowest willingness to donate. Illnesses which are described as behaviorally caused evoke a higher perceived degree of guilt (= 4.51, = 0.13) than illnesses which cannot be related to any misbehavior in advance (= 1.65, = 0.10) phlebotomies for iron depletion are performed until normal levels for iron storage parameters are reached. each consecutive blood donation iron storage parameters are determined. the donation is only accepted for transfusion to patients if iron storage parameters are within normal range. a special group were long-time repeat donors, whose changes in ferritin-values were analyzed in comparison to the first-ever ferritin value before the first donation. Interestingly, there are much more iron-depleted females in the control group than there are iron-depleted males. a study was conducted to evaluate the storage quality of processed RBCs. results were compared with quality control data of the CQ41470 whole blood system. tests were performed with a top-bottom two-component system (donation/plasma bag) connectable to a second two-component system containing a filter (transfer/red blood cell (RBC) bag) test blood components are generally produced in complex ready-for-use whole blood (WB) bag systems. quality data of test and control pooled platelet concentrates were negative in all cases. comparison of quality data obtained from conventionally produced blood components with those processed in a modular bag system did not reveal any significant differences. the plant comprises a conveyer belt, four camera-scanners for barcode- and product-type recognition, a balance, one labelling robot and two sorting robots. the host system processes the print- and sorting commands. the exchange of a data-telegram requires 14 ms. colourmetric indicators for 50 Gy radiation have recently become available. the RC-Scale indicators are designed to turn light blue following exposure to 25 Gy and dark blue on exposure to 50 Gy irradiation. irradiation is the current gold standard of irradiation devices. irradiation is the current gold standard of irradiation devices. irradiation is the current gold standard of irradiation devices. all PRBCs were effectively leukocyte-reduced and the WBC contamination was less than 1 106 WBC per unit. mean volume of P-PCs was 272 11 mL (n = 15) and of A-PCs 237 4 mL (n = 15) stored RBCs were tested over 42 days of storage for hemolysis rate. results In total we included 1,673 expired stored RBCs from 1,033 male and 640 female blood donors. male and female donors tend to a decrease of hemolysis at higher HDL levels. this tendency indicates that HDL could help to reduce hemolysis. LDL and triglycerides promote hemolysis in RBCs. we used Camptothecin-incubated samples as positive control. testing procedures and acceptance criteria were set in advance. results In this validation accuracy, intra-assay and inter-assay precision and stability of samples were verified. the aim of this study was to compare ADP-mediated responsiveness of stored platelets in both milieus. PRI levels remained stable and comparable to WB under continued storage. bacterial contamination and emerging pathogens remain a threat to transfusion safety. amotosalen levels and in vitro function of platelets were functional over 7 days storage. the response to hypotonic stress decreased from 101% [d1] to 84% [d7] the response to hypotonic stress decreased from 101% [d1] to 84% [d7] platelet adhesion to collagen surfaces was found to some extent under static and shear stress conditions. plasma concentrations of RANTES and CXCL7 were increased after shear stress. plasma concentrations of RANTES and RANTES were increased after shear stress. 121 whole blood and 99 apheresis plasma units were collected and analysed. 121 whole blood and 99 apheresis plasma units were collected and analysed. an extraction method was developed and validated. the applied method can be used for plastic extractions from human or animal tissues without remarkable effects on the plastics. DTT disrupts the disulphide bonds in the CD38 molecule, thereby denaturing the protein. a new reagent, DaraEx (Inno-Tran), inhibits the reactions between DARA and the test cells without negatively influencing other blood group antigens. specificities such as anti-D, anti-Fy(a), anti-Fy(b) and strong anti-K could be detected by both methods. weaker reaction observed with DTT-T cells was due to the DTT-T, but also the less sensitive method. we used selected Grifols antisera to find a time window for the most reliable result interpretation. results were statistically evaluated by the Mann-Whitney test using Graphpad Prism software. allo-/autoanti-LW antigens are denatured when treated with dithiothreitol. 61-year-old woman with autoanti-LWa in need of several peri- and postoperative transfusions. the patient was transfused with 16 O rr RBC products not to overlook an alloanti-D. however, the genotyping showed the predicted phenotype LW(a+b-) suggesting the diagnosis of an autoanti-LWa. a series of 63 cases were assessed by MDmulticard\u00ae. the results were compared with standard test methods, either serologically (Erytra\u00ae Grifols, Duedingen, CH or BioRad, Cressier, CH) or by molecular typing using PCR SSP (inno-train GmbH, Kronberg i. T., D). the results were confirmed by alternative methods or known pre-values. patients with autoantibodies having a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT) and recently transfused patients need testing of clinically significant blood antigens. Molecular techniques such as PCR have become a crucial tool but are on the one hand expensive and on the other hand time consuming. manual assays are labor intensive and prone to errors making it difficult to obtain fully reproducible results for clinical applications such as monitoring the production of IgG antibodies during pregnancy or to determine the time course of antibody concentration change. the need for an automated, more standardized method remains high. alloantibody titration prototype assays on the NEO IrisTM provide a fully automated, standardized solution to generate reproducible and consistent titer results for a wide range of clinically significant red cell IgG antibodies. the patient had hemoglobine values of 8.2\u201310.8 g/dl during pregnancy. she received an oral iron substitution and prednisolone therapy with 10 mg/d. there was no clinical or sonographic evidence of anemia in fetus. the clinical course in the newborn was unremarkable. two weeks after suffering from gastroenteritis of unknown cause, the patient was hospitalized because of symptomatic hemolytic anemia. laboratory tests revealed hemoglobin of 6.2g/dl, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, reticulocytes and bilirubin as well as decreased haptoglobin. the overall results confirmed autoanti-D causing the hemolysis. autoantibodies are generally considered irrelevant for transfusion management. but become crucial when causing acute hemolysis. ccddee genotype of the child, intrauterine and postnatal blood transfusions were performed with O Rh pos. (CCD.ee) erythrocytes. compatible cc blood would have been eliminated due to the high anti-c-titer. due to rupture of membranes a caesarean section was performed 30+2 weeks of gestation. deficiency, mental retardation, dysmorphic features, and growth retardation. the patient presented with growth retardation (140 cm, 35 kg), unusual facial appearance. pan-reactive antibodies were detected both in saline and indirect Coomb\u00bbs test. a human intestinal organ culture model allows studying the onset of an inflammatory response in resident LP immune cells. in this model, the depletion of epithelial cells leads to the activation of resident LP immune cells as well as their emigration out of the LP. the model reflects many features of intestinal inflammation in vivo. emigrated MOs and mDCs upregulated CD40, CD80, CD86 and HLA-DR. both cells showed reduced expression or lacked the innate response receptors CD11b, CD14, CD16. the latter receptor was expressed on all activated myeloid populations. anti-D and weak anti-C antibody were detected in the patient's pre-transfusion sample. three days later, the reactivity of anti-D was significantly reduced in the indirect antiglobulin test (DAT) and eluate. the aim of our study was to analyze a novel surgery blood suction system with an automatic control setup. blood cell counts, hemolysis levels according to free hemoglobin (fHb) and platelet functions were measured to determine the integrity of the three blood fractions. patient blood management (PBM) has been developed as evidence-based clinical tool. clinicians can optimise preoperative anaemia, manage peri-operative bleeding, avoid unnecessary blood transfusion and improve patient outcome (1)(2). many hospitals still seek guidance with the implementation of PBM in clinical routine. mechanisms underlying anemia of CKD are diminished production of erythropoietin, dysfunctional iron metabolism and shortened erythrocyte survival. anemia has been mentioned by clinical practice guidelines (CPG) as a criterion for referral to specialist nephrological services. a large proportion of the packed red blood cells (PRBCs) ordered and prepared for surgical interventions is not transfused. a new patient- and surgery-specific Blood Ordering Algorithm (psBOA) PS-3B-4 developed. the number of PRBCs, sent to the OR, was limited to 2 PRBCs. the number of PRBCs, preoperatively tested and stored in the blood depot, was calculated on the basis of two parameters: the 85% percentile of PRBCs transfused between 2012 and 2015. the results of the psBOA were compared to the predictions of the traditional Maximum Surgical Blood Ordering Schedule (MSBOS) GMP compliant design qualification (DQ) and installation qualification (IQ) was initiated considering all components of the automation (bulk sorter, input-/output module, tube transport, centrifuge, analysers, sample storage) the analyser for donor testing was installed in a separate location to be operated in manual, front loading mode. the test system is suitable for infectious disease testing of blood donors with an adequate test sensitivity and specificity. the instrument itself has several disadvantages, such as frequent technical problems, high amount of waste, lack of automated re-testing procedures for initially reactive samples etc. from November 2017 to February 2018 8011 first-time donors were tested on both systems. in total 18 repeat reactive samples for HCV (2 confirmed positive), 11 repeat reactive samples for HIV (none confirmed positive) and 13 HBsAg repeat reactive samples (9 confirmed reactive) were found on alinity s. cobas\u00ae MPX-test and cobas\u00ae DPX-test were used for detection of viral nucleic acids in whole blood and plasma donations. the DPX-test is a duplex real-time RT-PCR-test for detection of HBV, HCV, HIV-1, and HIV-2. NAT testing was carried out in pools of 96 donations. NAT screening of blood donations has become standard in developed countries. but only a handful of countries worldwide perform ID-NAT. different algorithms are currently in use to eliminate false reactive results. 229 of these samples were repeat reactive (RR: 18 HIV, 61 HCV, 150 HBV) only 229 of these samples were repeat reactive (0.12% nonRR) of these 2'223 IR but nonRR donations follow-up data were available from 1'267 donors for further analysis. repeated donors were more frequently affected by active HCV infection than first time donors. NAT+ donors are younger than NAT-: 50% NAT+ are younger than 35 years compared to 39% NAT-. syphilis cases have increased in the group of male RD from 5.7 to 8.6/100,000 and from 1.8 to 2.6/100,000 among female RD. between 2006 and 2016, the trend of reported syphilis infections per 100,000 population was stable. the most affected risk population for syphilis infections is deferred from donating. information on transmission categories was incomplete. for 30% of syphilis positive donors an unlikely transmission category was reported. results Of all enrolled blood donors (n = 220) we could evaluate 219 donors. from these 17.8% (n = 39) were HEV anti-IgG positive, 2.7% (n = 6) HEV anti-IgG and anti-IgM positive and 0.5% (n = 1) anti-IgM positive only. total of 10,141 allogenic blood donations from 7,650 individual german blood donors were screened for the presence of HEV RNA using a MP-NAT in pools of 96 samples. the presence of HEV-specific IgM and IgG antibodies in HEV RNA positive samples was determined using the anti-HEV IgM/IgG ELISA. the clinical relevance of and need of identification of these low level HEV positive donors still requires further investigation. the clinical relevance of and need of identification of these low level HEV positive donors still requires further investigation. results Of 1549 donors tested for anti-PB19 IgG 1197 (77.3%) were found positive. there is a significant increase of IgG-positive donors with increasing age. there seems to be a higher IgG positive rate in rural donors. die Einreichung des Abstracts erfolgt unabh\u00e4ngig von der Firma Mikrogen. die auch keinen Einblick in die Daten und auch keinen Einfluss auf deren Auswertung hatte. mL in -PCs and 344 14.9mL in UVC-PCs with platelet counts of 3.1 0.3/ unit, 3.2 0.3/unit and 3.0 0,2/unit, respectively. at the end of shelf life, the pH value of UVC-PCs was comparable to -PCs (7.31 0.08) and AP-PCs (7.29 0.09). pooling, gamma-irradiated (30 Gy) PCs and untreated PCs. for statistical analysis, we analyzed product volume, residual erythrocytes, residual leukocytes, platelet content, total protein concentration, pH and sterility. the titer of MERS-CoV (strain HCoV-EMC, Ron A. Fouchier), SARS-CoV (strain Frankfurt 1) and Zaire EBOV (strain Mayinga-76) was determined as tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) after spiking, a virus titer of 5.9\u20136.1 (MERS-CoV), 5.4\u20135.6 (SARS-CoV) or 6.9\u20137.0 (EBOV) was the THERAFLEX UV-Platelets system (Macopharma) uses UVC light only without the need of any additional photoactive compound. PCs (n = 2 for each virus, 375 mL) were then UVC-irradiated on the Macotronic UV machine (Macopharma) sam received project grants from the forschungsgemeinschaft der DRK-Blutspendedienste e.V. and work together with MacoPharma on the development of pathogen inactivation systems for blood products. sam received project grants from the forschungsgemeinschaft der DRK-Blutspendedienste e.V. 10,721 general hospitalized patients and 998 chronically transfused patients were screened for natural S-303-specific antibodies. assay was used during a randomized, controlled, double-blind, non-inferiority, two-period, two-treatment, crossover study to evaluate S-303/GSH-treated RBC in Thalassemia major subjects. the Protac-based mode of PC activation differs from endothelial cell-dependent PC activation through the thrombin-(FIIa)-thrombomodulin (TM) complex. however, PC activity levels measured with Protac-based assays might not capture the true enzyme function in patients with mutations in the gene for PC (PROC) the results of the Protac-based assay and the FIIa-TM-based assay correlated well with PC activity levels of the automated coagulation analyzer. no PC deficient patient showed PC activity levels within the normal range in any of the three assays. the authors do not have a financial interest/arrangement or affiliation that could be perceived as a real or apparent conflict of interest. the patient was diagnosed with dysfibrinogenemia. it is best-practice to substitute fibrinogen and applicate low-molecular-weight heparins simultaneously to prevent bleeding, thrombosis, and pregnancy loss. twenty-three consecutive cardiac surgery patients underwent hemostasis management. results were compared with TEG\u00ae6s parameters, which were concurrently determined using its multi-channel microfluidic cartridge system. a complete loss of this integrin expression usually cause autosomal recessive Glanzmann thrombasthenia. rarely, ITGB3 gene mutations may cause autosomal dominant macrothrombocytopenia. those patients may develop severe mucocuteneous bleeding. silico analysis suggests gain of function mechanism brought about by formation of non-native contacts. p.Leu738Arg mutation was not detected in two further family members with regular platelet count and function. discordant results were only detected in the Bethesda assay negative results (0,4 BU) the clinical relevance of the immunoassay positive and functional Bethesda assay negative samples needs to be further investigated. the reverse grouping detected a strongly reactive anti-B (++++) but no reactivity with A1, A2 and 0 test cells. commercial PCR-SSP clearly indicated the genotype O1vA1 predicting the phenotype A1. several alleles, most as a result of single nucleotide polymorphisms, have been reported. one case of compound heterozygosity has been reported, leading to severe nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia and kernicterus. the mutation c.636C>G leads to a premature stop codon at amino acid 212 (Y212Ter) in front of the C-terminal zinc finger DNA-binding domains. adsorption-elution test with a polyclonal anti-Lu(b) gave a very weak positive result, which is in accordance with the In(Lu) phenotype. the pregnancy was closely monitored by analysing the antibody titer and sonographic assessments of the middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity of the foetus. the baby was born at 38+3 weeks of gestation without complication. the \u2013D\u2013/\u2013D\u2013patient with allo-anti-Rh17 and her child were successfully treated. conflict of interest none Background An obviously Rh D neg female patient with an anti-D of unknown origin was subsequently typed rare RHD (147delA) allele. this allele, causing a frameshift mutation, could permit the production of trace amounts of functional protein, was described as phenotype RH DEL. a possible anti-LWa antibody was excluded using O Rh neg and O Rh pos cord blood erythrocytes. the family analysis showed that her brother shares the same mutation, but without anti-D antibody development. the ongoing rapid and constant anti-D antibody titer rise remains unclear. the most frequent alleles were RHD*08N.01 (RHDpsi, n = 11), RHD*04.01 (DIVa), RHD*03.04 (DIII type 5), RHD*10.03 (DAU-3; DAU-0 not included due to artefacts) and RHD*09.03.01 (weak D Type 4.0) the status of these SNPs was compared to other samples carrying L62F, A137V, N152T, T201R, F223V or 819G>A including RHD*09.03.01 and RHD*04.01. SNPs in the region 25275003 to 25293530 were present in a large proportion of samples homozygous for L62F, A137V or N152T including RHD*04.01. serologically pre-typed samples were genotyped for 26 individuals with pre-existent blood group serotypes. 23 of these 26 samples were also typed for ABO (RBC-FluoGene ABO Basic, inno-train Diagnostik GmbH) only two assays are required for parallel molecular testing of ABO, RhD, RhCE, Kell, Kidd, Duffy, MNS, Dombrock, Lutheran, Lutheran, Lutheran, Lutheran, Cartwright, Diego, Vel, Colton and Knops. a total of 90 \u00abrare donors\u00bb could be detected by genotyping. 59 of 90 \u00abrare donors\u00bb could be confirmed by genotyping. the human platelet alloantigens (HPA) are located on glycoproteins on the platelet surface. the antigens are defined by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the glycoprotein genes. the antigen status can be determined by genotyping the SNPs. EVA values from heterozygotes were significantly lower compared to HPA-1a or HPA-5b homozygotes (p0.0001 each) however, discrimination between the two genotypes was not possible on the basis of the EVA values. alleles should be part of the DRB1*15:01 DQA1*01:02/DQA1*01:13 haplotype. results The full-length sequence analysis unraveled a quite high similarity to the DQA1*01:01 allele. LR-PCR and NGS including phased sequence analysis revealed the unambiguous full-length sequence of DQA1*01:01 and DQA1*01:13 alleles. conflict of interest Es bestehen keine Interessenkonflikte. the patient, a 73 years old woman, was transplanted without any preformed HLA-Antibodies with a kidney of a 79 years old donor. a new analysis for DSA at that time revealed a de novo allel-specific antibody against HLA-DQB1*06:01 with the recipient's HLA-typing being DRB1*04:01, 15:01, DQB1*03:01, 06:02. the aim of our study was to investigate whether quantifying donorspecific T-cells by IFN-g ELISpot non-invasively detects T-cell mediated rejection. all patients displayed no evidence of immunization before transplantation. IgE is a chronic, inflammatory condition of the skin that includes symptoms like erythema, scaling and pruritus in affected areas. some patients with severe AD show high serum IgE levels. in total, IA selectively depleted 80,6% of IgE until the end of each treatment cycle. in total, IA selectively depleted 80,6% of IgE until the end of each treatment cycle. the average SCORAD index from all patients showed a significant reduction until the end of the study period. 16G venous indwelling cannulas (Vasofix grey, inner diameter 1.7mm, Braun) were used for inlet access. a single lumen (NuPort CTP- 009CP, id 1.6 mm), a double lumen port (C-Port-DL, id 1.18 mm) were validated. using the dual lumen CDL and 18G needles for inlet and return up to 70ml/min could be achieved, first alarms occurring at 115ml/min. on the return side 142ml/min could be reached without any alarms (350mmHg return line pressure) indication for immunoadsorption was high inhibitor titer (n = 4; 57%) and/or severe bleeding. Triggering cause was not evident (idiopathic) in 6 patients (86%) blood donation services have a great challenge in CCs because all responsible persons (management, divisional director, head of department, head of quality control, head of production and qualified persons) must be involved in general changes. a complete CC including all attachments is electronically archived in Saperion. the entire CC is electronically available (including all attachments as PDF) the entire CC is electronically available (including all attachments as PDF) the overall workload could be reduced due to the easily achievable general CCs. the program is available via Eurocode IBLS (headquarters@eurocode.org) it is nearly impossible to monitor in a multi-site company of 4 hospitals with distances up to 273km that are provided with drug products by 3 different pharmacies and 2 blood donation centres. a bidirectional laboratory information-ward communication system was implemented to digitally map the entire process. the first training for the digital modules was attended by 46% of the staff. it was possible to track each drug product and evaluate sufficiency and quality of the therapy protocols subjected to patient and staff. system errors occurred due to lack of communication about gathering products from the depots. both erythrocytes and thrombocytes have their own Raman profile. the spectra of leukocytes should be different when compared to erythrocytes and thrombocytes."}
