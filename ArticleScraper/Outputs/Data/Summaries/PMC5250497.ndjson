{"summary": "Sprague\u2013Dawley rats (Rattus norvegicus; n = 36; weight, 387.6 2.1 g; Charles River, Wilmington, MA) were free of Kilham rat virus, rat Theiler virus, rat coronavirus, rat minute virus, Toolan H1 virus, rat parvovirus, reovirus type 3, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, murine adenovirus types 5% isoflurane in 100% O2 by mask. each rat was placed in sternal recumbency. a 1-cm longitudinal incision through skin and fascia was made. Exp1 (n = 8; 1 mg/kg SC local infiltration once, 0.03 mL; Exparel, 13.3 mg/mL, Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Parsippany, NJ); or Exp6 (n = 8; 6 mg/kg SC local infiltration once, 0.17 mL; Exparel, 13.3 mg/mL, Pacira Pharmaceuticals) all experimental compounds were administered 5 min prior to skin incision. each mechanical stimulus was administered for 1 s on various locations of the plantar surface. withdrawal responses were defined as the number of times a rat lifted his paw off the mesh after von Frey stimulation during 10 applications of monofilaments. Sentinel animals were free of Kilham rat virus, rat Theiler virus, rat minute virus, rat parvovirus, reovirus type 3, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, mycoplasma pulmonis, pneumonia virus of mice. all rats were fed a commercial diet (Teklad Global 18% Protein Rodent Diet 2018, Harlan Laboratories, Madison, WI), provided bottles with reverse-osmosis\u2013purified water. each rat was placed in sternal recumbency, and the plantar surface of the left hindpaw was surgically prepared and draped. the plantaris muscle was identified, elevated, and incised longitudinally without interrupting the muscle attachments. the incision was closed with 2 interrupted horizontal mattress sutures. all experimental compounds were administered 5 min prior to skin incision. local anesthetics were injected into the plantar surface of rats\u2019 hindpaws. digital pressure was applied to the injection site for 5 s. mechanical hypersensitivity was defined as a significant increase in paw withdrawal frequency after focal thermal stimuli. the right (contralateral) hindpaw of each rat served as a control. Bup HCl rats did not differ between day \u20131 (383 2.7 g) and day 4 (382 5.0 g), nor did body weight differ between groups prior to the experiment.

Bup HCl remains a cornerstone of effective rodent postoperative analgesia. its advantages include its control of mild to severe pain, multiple routes of delivery, relatively long duration of action (6 to 12 h in most species), and minimal cardiorespiratory depression. liposomal bupivacaine effectively attenuated mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity on all 4 d of testing. liposomal bupivacaine attenuated mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity for 4 d. liposomal bupivacaine did not attenuate both hypersensitivities in a dose-dependent manner. somal bupivacaine is based on the volume required to cover the surgical site. a ceiling effect may occur20 once all local nociceptors have been exposed to the minimal amount of local anesthetic necessary for analgesia. the 6-mg/kg dose of liposomal bupivacaine would be effective if infiltrated in a larger surgical site. other possible factors contributing to the variability of our findings include injection pressure, speed of injection, and liposomal bupivacaine is currently under review for the veterinary market. a single dose of liposomal bupivacaine (1 mg/kg local infiltration) is recommended for 4 days of postoperative analgesia in a rat incisional pain model. infiltration volumes, to suggest dosages for larger surgical sites, to examine its application in different surgical pain models and with other laboratory animal species. to perform sequential histologic examinations of surgical infiltration sites."}
