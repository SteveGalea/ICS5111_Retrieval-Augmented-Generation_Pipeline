{"summary": "ribosome is a type of intracellular machinery responsible for protein biosynthesis in all cells. ribosome components include ribosomal proteins (RPs) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in eukaryotes, the biogenesis of ribosomes occurs within the nucleolus and requires the coordinated assembly of 4 rRNAs (5S, 5.8S, 18S, and 28S rRNAs) RPs play critical roles in the life cycle of viruses. in virus-infected cells, virus may usurp an endogenous translation pathway. translation of cellular mRNA is selectively suppressed, whereas translation initiation of RPs mRNA increases. internal ribosome entry site 1 (IRES-1) depends on RPS25 for 40S subunit recruitment, mRNA loading and 60S joining. no eIFs are required in this process; in ribosomal shunting, RPS25 is also indispensable. IRES is a cis-element in 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of viral mRNA. it can recruit ribosomes to initiate the synthesis of viral proteins. it recruits the 40S and 60S subunits to form functional 80S complexes in the absence of any eIFs. IRES-1 and IRES-2 both induce conformational change in the ribosome upon binding. binding to 40S subunit of IRES-2 is regulated by RPS5 with its -hairpin structure. RPS25 is non-essential in viral cap-dependent translation, but it plays a critical role in all viral IRES-mediated translation. RES-2-mediated translation, and the effect of RACK1 may associate with eIF3 to assemble a translation preinitiation complex. 40S subunit is recruited to the 5\u2032 end of viral RNA through a cap-dependent manner. 40S subunit is fastened to mRNA by either base pairing with 18S rRNA. -1 ribosomal frameshifting (-1PRF) is also a widely used translation recoding mechanism by virus. a part of translating ribosomes slip back one nucleotide site so that the translation continues in a new ORF. virus can translate one mRNA template to produce two different proteins, which expands the utilization of viral limited genetic information. a flood of viruses has been shown to induce phosphorylation of RPs. a flood of viruses has been shown to induce phosphorylation of RPs. a phosphorylation of RPs is a famous representative. phosphorylation of RPS6 is a nonspecific response to virus. phosphorylation occurs in cells transformed by completely inactivated PRV. phosphorylation of viral genome is not required for virus eliciting phosphorylation. the cap-independent Turnip mosaic virus requires RPS6 and RPS6K for viral accumulation in plant cells. accumulation of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) with the 5\u2032 m7Gppp cap is independent of RPS6 and RPS6K. the molecular mechanisms underlying the diverse effects of RPS6 phosphorylation on virus infection in cells are widely reported. RPL18 of Arabidopsis thaliana interacts with P6 of CaMV in complexes. reduced expression of RPL18 effectively inhibits Ebola virus infection in 293T cells [81]. n of rice stripe tenuivirus interacts with RPL18 of insect vector. pro can interact with translation factors both eIF4E and eIF(iso)4E [89], while RPL10 (P0) promotes translation of Potato virus A by interacting with VPg and eIF(iso)4E [90]. HCpro is also a vector transmission helper factor, mediating the retention of virions to aphid mouthparts. RPL4 IBDV VP3 S Modulation of IBDV replication [93] Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) EBNA1 NS Establishing persistent B-lymphoblastoid cell infection [94] 5. RPL7 Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Gag S As a helper contributing to the start of Gag assembly [84] White spot syndrome virus (WSSV) VP51 S Involving in WSSV infection [95] RPLP1 and RPLP2 strongly reduced early DENV protein accumulation. global protein synthesis is relatively stable in cells, suggesting a requirement for RPLP1/2 heterodimer in viral translation. eIF-5A uses the 5S rRNA cellular transport system through partnering with eIF-5A. fibrillarin and nucleolin are two major components of the nucleolus involved in ribosome biogenesis. the nucleolus entry of AIBV N protein results in specific changes of the nucleolar proteome and delay of the cell cycle. some RPs have been shown to take part in viral genome replication or transcription in host. encoded RNA 1 (EBER-1), a noncoding RNA, recruiting human RPL22 mediates relocalization of RPL22 in EBV-infected cells. the predominant translation initiation pathway of cellular mRNA is cap-dependent, which requires recognition of mRNA 5\u2032 cap by the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) many viral mRNAs have no 5\u2032 cap structures. IRES-2 (from hepatitis C virus) relys on RPS5 to bind 40S subunit with the participation of eIFs. RPS25 is required in subsequent mRNA loading and 60S joining process. in ribosomal frameshifting, RPL3 controls translational fidelity. IRES-2 needs a subset of canonical eIFs (eIF3) and Met-tRNA to bind to 40S subunit. this group is mainly from Flaviviridae family that infects mammal. IRES-3 (including Encephalomyocarditis virus) and IRES-4 (including poliovirus and rhinovirus, etc.) the propagation of HCV and poliovirus is impaired in cells depleted of RPS25 [31,34,36] RPS25 likely functions in a downstream step. the 5\u2032 leader of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 genomic RNA can fold into IRES to recruit 40S subunit and drive translation initiation of viral Gag protein. 40S subunit is recruited to the 5\u2032 end of viral RNA through a cap-dependent manner. after scanning 5\u2032 UTR or translating a short open reading frame, 40S subunit jumps from a shunt donor region to the downstream acceptor region. ribosome shunting by adenovirus tripartite leader is impaired in RPS25-deficient cells. the ratio of Gag to Gag-Pol is strictly maintained for efficient virus assembly and maturation [51,52]. Shiftless is an inhibitor of -1PRF, which interacts with -1PRF signal of HIV-1 mRNA and translating ribosomes. in yeast, RPL3 mutations lead to rapid loss of M1 killer virus. tyrosine-specific protein kinase of Vaccinia virus can phosphorylate RPS2 [65,66], and tyrosine-specific protein kinase of Abelson murine leukemia virus enhances RPS6 phosphorylation by activating RPS6K and/or inactivating RPS6 phosphatase [67]. despite a large number of reports on the increasing phosphorylation of RPs induced by viral infection phosphorylation is always correlated with efficient translation of RPs mRNA. a reduction of RPS6 level diminishes the expression of viral mRNA. a reduction of RPS6 level diminishes the expression of viral mRNA, but does not impair host cellular translation. characterized roles of interactions on positive regulation of virus infection can be roughly divided into 3 classes. class 1 belongs to ribosomal function, in which Sin nombre hantavirus (SNV) N-RPS19 interaction is a typical case. it could combine with 40S subunit, mRNA cap and unphosphorylated eIF2. RPs exercise these functions depending on the specific localization outside of ribosome. RPL22 translocates from the nucleoli to the nucleoplasm to interact with HSV-1 ICP4 for regulating viral DNA synthesis and late gene expression. RPS19 Sin nombre hantavirus (SNV) N S Facilitating N-mediated translation initiation mechanism [76,77,78] RPL18 Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) P6 NS Translational transactivation [79,80] Rice stripe tenuivirus (RSV) N S Promoting viral translation and replication [82] Dengue virus (DENV) NS1 NS Required for viral translation and replication [83] Potato virus A (PVA) HCPro the interaction of eIF-5A with HIV-1 Rev trans-activator mediates the nuclear export of viral unspliced mRNA. eIF-5A uses the 5S rRNA cellular transport system through partnering with RPL. the accumulation of TBSV is dependent on RPL19, RPL13, RPL7 and RPS2. this phenomenon is considered as a result of the virus\u2013host interaction. the modulation of ribosome biogenesis in the nucleolus by coronaviruses might be a better case. a few RPs can bind viral noncoding RNA to maintain their viral functions. RPs interact with viral proteins to inhibit virus transcription or translation. RPs interact with viral proteins to inhibit directly virus transcription. rPS10, 18S rRNA and lesser tRNAs bind to Nef protein of HIV-1 to from a complex, decreasing viral protein synthesis. second, RPs as immune factors activate antiviral defense signaling pathways. RPs have huge therapeutic potential as targets. the antiviral mechanism of PAP is poorly understood. it is proposed that PAP may inhibit virus translation by binding and depurinating capped viral RNAs. however, PAP does not depurinate uncapped viral RNAs (such as TBSV) and IRES-containing RNA (such as poliovirus), but PAP inhibit translation of these viral RNAs [135] PA and FU exhibit effective antiviral and preventive activities for a series of DNA and RNA virus by disrupting ZFP domain of RPS27. many viruses encode ZFP-containing viral proteins for replication, such as HIV-1 Np7, HSV-1 ICPO, IVA M1, HCV NS2 and Reoviruses -3. HP (2-20) is an antibacterial sequence with a membrane-disruptive property from RPL1 of Helicobacter pylori. the novel virus\u2013cell fusion inhibitory peptide to defense virus infection."}
