{"summary": "enteroviruses are viruses that infect humans (species A to D), bovines (species E and F), swine (species G), and nonhuman primates (species A, B, D, H, and J). Currently, EV species G (EVG) is divided into 11 types, EV-G1 to EV-G11 (2\u20134). intratypic recombinants are produced about 100 times more often than intertypic recombinants (18). a cross-order recombinant in which an exogenous papain-like protease (PLP) gene of torovirus (order Picornavirales) naturally recombined into the 2C/3A junction of the genome of enterovirus G (order Picornavirales), generating a chimeric virus designated EVG 08/NC_USA we characterized the novel recombinant virus EVG 08/NC_USA/2015. we elucidated the DUB function of the EVG ToV-PLP protein. we investigated its effect on host cell innate immune responses. our study reveals a novel cross-order recombination event. 9 large plaques were selected for sequencing analysis of the foreign gene insertion region. the recombinant viruses obtained from these 9 plaques contained only the 582-nt insertion, which was determined to be stable in 10 passages in ST cells. we also directly passaged the original sample (without plaque purification) on ST cells for 10 passages and sequenced the foreign gene insertion region. phylogenetic analysis shows that the novel recombinant virus EVG 08/NC_USA/2015 is most closely related to a group of EVGs detected in 2012 in pigs in the ThanhBinh and CaoLanh areas of Vietnam. the single ORF is flanked by a long 5\u2032 UTR (812 nucleotides) and a short 3\u2032 UTR (72 nucleotides) nt 2,265 nt 77.0 3\u2032 UTR 71 nt 72 nt 88.4 Full length 7,981 nt 7,335 nt 75.4 Protein regions P1 VP4 69 aa 69 aa 91.3 VP2 246 aa 246 aa 82.9 VP3 280 aa 277 aa 71.8 VP1 243 aa 243 aa 60.1 P2 2Apro BLAST search results showed that this foreign gene is most homologous to the PLP gene located in the nsp3-like region of the torovirus genome. phylogenetic analysis further showed that this foreign PLP forms a well-supported clade with PLPs of other toroviruses, including bovine, porcine, and equine toroviruses. iterative modeling using I-TASSER (42) pinpointed sequence and structural similarities between EVG ToV-PLP and the leader protease of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV-Lpro) iterative modeling pinpointed sequence and structural homology between this PLP and other viral proteases. mmalian deubiquitinating enzymes lack the primarily -stranded \u201cfinger domains\u201d that bridge the N- and C-terminal subdomains. a major distinction is that the minimal protease domains of ToV-PLP (and FMDV-Lpro) lack the primarily -stranded \u201cfinger domains\u201d in the catalytic folds of coronaviral proteases and eukaryotic deubiquitinases. the secondary structures of toV-PLP and FMDV-Lpro are shown in black above the sequences. the catalytic residues are marked with purple stars and a DUB-specific \u201csignature\u201d motif in the protease catalytic sites is indicated with a light blue box (21). HEK-293T cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing hemagglutinin (HA-Ub) and a plasmid expressing wild-type ToV-PLP or a catalytic-site mutant of ToV-PLP. an empty plasmid vector and a plasmid expressing the PLP2 domain of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus were used as controls. HEK-293T cells were cotransfected with plasmid DNAs expressing HA-Ub and FLAG-tagged ToV-PLP or PRRSV-PLP2 or their catalytic-site mutants. the expression of FLAG-tagged PLPs was detected by anti-HA MAb M2. cell-free deubiquitination activity was analyzed by using K48-linked polyubiquitin chains (Ub3\u20137) (C), K63-linked polyubiquitin chains (D), or M1-linked polyubiquitin chains (E) as the substrates and incubation with serially diluted GST-PLP (1 g, 0.5 g, and 0.25 g) the mature form of ISG15 was visualized by SDS-PAGE. to confirm the deISGylation activity of this recombinant PLP, we carried out an in vitro proteolytic assay using an ISG15 precursor (proISG15) as a cleavage substrate. a mutant that contains mutations in the putative catalytic triad exhibits no deISGylation activity. the expression of PRRSV-PLP2 significantly inhibited luciferase gene expression. a strong reporter signal was observed in cells transfected with the empty plasmid. a strong reporter signal was observed in cells transfected with the plasmid. luciferase activity is defined as the ratio of firefly luciferase reporter activity to Renilla luciferase activity. each data point represents the mean value from three experiments. expression of PLPs was detected by Western blotting using anti-FLAG MAb M2. vEVG genome contains C14, T2029, and G7724 mutations. compared to the genome sequence of the parental virus, the DNA sequence of pEVG contained 3-nt differences at the following genome positions: T14, G2029, and A7724. BHK-21C cells were initially transfected with plasmid DNA of the full-length cDNA clone pEVG or its mutant. ST cells were infected with the cloned viruses rescued from BHK cells. expression of toV-PLP and structural protein VP1 was detected by specific MAb 128-28 and MAb 115-5, respectively. the toV-PLP knockout recombinant enterovirus shows a reduced ability to inhibit innate immune gene expression in infected cells. the amount of Ub-conjugated proteins was decreased by about 95% in both EVG 08/NC_USA/2015- and vEVG-infected cells. the amount of Ub-conjugated proteins in vPLP-KO-infected cells was elevated 8.7-fold compared to that in cells inf HEK-293T cells were transfected with plasmid DNAs expressing HA-Ub. hek-293T cells were cotransfected with plasmid DNAs expressing FLAG-tagged ISG15 and its conjugation enzyme E1/E2/E3. the expression of the GAPDH housekeeping gene was detected as a loading control. EVG-infected cells showed 6.6-, 5.3-, and 4.1-fold increased expression levels of type I IFN (IFN-), type III IFN (IL-28B) and ISG15 in vPLP-KO-infected cells respectively. vPLP-KO showed reduced ability to antagonize expression of both type I interferons and type III interferons. ST cells were infected with the parental virus EVG 08/NC_USA/2015, the cloned virus vEVG, or the PLP knockout mutant vPLP-KO at an MOI of 3. Mock-infected cells were used as a control. total RNAs were then extracted from cell lysates to perform real-time RT-PCR. BLAST search results showed that this 66-nt sequence has little or no homology to any other sequences in GenBank. this virus was purified by using a plaque assay. nine large plaques were selected for sequencing analysis of the foreign gene insertion region. the recombinant viruses obtained from these 9 plaques contained only the 582-nt insertion. full-length genome sequences of EVG 08/NC_USA/2015 show 75.4% nucleotide identity to the sequence of prototypic EVG strain PEV9 UKG/410/73. phylogenetic analysis shows that the novel recombinant virus EVG 08/NC_USA/2015 is most closely related to a group of EVGs detected in 2012 in pigs in the ThanhBinh and CaoLanh areas of Vietnam. /73 Gene regions 5\u2032 UTR 812 nt 756 nta 87.5 Polyprotein-coding region 7,098 nt 6,507 nt 73.5 P1-coding region 2,514 nt 2,505 nt 68.1 P2-coding region 1,734 nt 1,734 nt 77.9 P3-coding region 2,265 nt 2,265 nt 77.0 3\u2032 UTR 71 nt 72 nt enterovirus, rhinovirus, porcine enterovirus, simian enterovirus, coxsackievirus, and poliovirus are denoted EV, RV, PEV, OEV, SEV, CV, and PV respectively. BLAST search results showed that this foreign gene is most homologous to the PLP gene located in the nsp3-like region of the torovirus genome. recombinant EVG ToV-PLP functions as a deubiquitinase and deISGylase to suppress host cell innate immune responses. iterative modeling using I-TASSER (42) pinpointed sequence and structural similarities between this PLP and other viral proteases. toV-PLP exhibits sequence and structural homology to the N- and C-terminal subdomains of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and MERS-CoV (MERS-CoV) PLPs. the minimal protease domains of ToV-PLP (and FMDV-Lpro) lack the primarily -stranded \u201cfinger domains\u201d that bridge the N- and C-terminal subdomains, e. sequences and numbering correspond to the following GenBank protein accession numbers: CAA25416.1 for the FMDV leader protease, AEA10817.1 for SARS coronavirus PLP, YP_009047202.1 for MERS coronavirus PLP, AAU06353.1 for murine hepatitis virus (MHV) PLP, AFD98833.1 for human coronavirus NL63 PLP, ABI26421.1 for infectious bron HEK-293T cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing hemagglutinin (HA-Ub) and a plasmid expressing wild-type ToV-PLP or a catalytic-site mutant of toV-PLP. the expression of each PLP and HA-Ub in transfected cells was confirmed by Western blotting. HEK-293T cells were cotransfected with plasmid DNAs expressing ISG15 and its conjugation enzyme E1/E2/E3, ToV-PLP, or PRRSV-PLP2 or their catalytic-site mutants. the expression of FLAG-tagged PLPs was detected by anti-HA MAb. cell-free deubiquitination activity was analyzed by using K48-linked polyubiquitin chains (Ub3\u20137) (C), K63-linked polyubiquitin chains (D), or M1-linked polyubiquitin chains (E) as the substrates. the molecular mass of Ub6 (51 kDa) is close to that of GST-PLP (50.4 kDa) ubiquitin deconjugation assays using recombinant ToV-PLP purified from Escherichia coli. both K48- and K63-linked polyubiquitin chains are efficiently cleaved to monomeric ubiquitin by recombinant ToV-PLP. to confirm the deISGylation activity of this recombinant PLP, we carried out an in vitro proteolytic assay using an ISG15 precursor HEK-293T cells were cotransfected with plasmids that express wild-type or mutant ToV-PLP, p125-Luc, and Renilla luciferase (pRL-SV40) at 24 h posttransfection, cells were infected with Sendai virus (SeV) to induce luciferase production. catalytic-site mutant (PLP mut and PLP2 mut, respectively) cells were stimulated by SeV at 24 h posttransfection. the expression of PLPs was detected by Western blotting using anti-FLAG. the pEVG construct contains a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter at the 5\u2032 terminus of the viral genome, the 7,981-nucleotide full-length genome of EVG 08/NC_USA/2015. compared to the genome sequence of the parental virus, the DNA sequence of pEVG contained 3-nt differences at the following genome positions: T14, G2029, and A7724. a synthesized HDV ribozyme gene was assembled into the pACYC177 vector by using the NEBuilder HiFi DNA assembly method. the pACYC177 vector was assembled by using the NEBuilder HiFi DNA assembly method. both the parental virus and the cloned virus reached titers at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 hpi. vPLP-KO was impaired in growth in ST cells, with an 1-log-lower virus titer at 12 hpi. recombinant EVGs were initially inoculated with the recombinant virus at an MOI of 0.01. the cell culture supernatant was serially harvested at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 hpi. proteins in cells infected with vPLP-KO were elevated 47-fold. no significant difference in the DUB/deISGylation abilities of parental and cloned viruses. similar levels of Ub/ISG15-conjugated host proteins were detected by Western blotting using anti-HA MAb. vEVG, or vPLP-KO, and innate immune gene expression was analyzed at 10 hpi. similar levels of IFN-, interleukin-28B (IL-28B) and ISG15 expression were observed in cells infected with EVG 08/NC_USA/2015 and vEVG. expression levels were increased by 8.3- and 12.7-fold in vPLP-KO-infected cells compared to vEVG-infected cells. we also observed increased expression levels of ISGs, including IRF7 (7.4-fold increase) and ISG15 (17.9-fold increase), in vEVG-infected cells. the discovery of PV recombination may date as far back as the 1960s (51) the widely used oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) contains a cocktail of three attenuated serotypes. the intertypic recombination of PV with human enterovirus C (HEV-C) species also appears to occur under natural conditions (16, 17, 52, 57) enteroviral genome backbone was modified to overcome potential nucleotide- and protein-level incompatibilities. recombination event may have occurred within a host animal that was simultaneously infected with enterovirus and torovirus. 582-nt toV-PLP gene segment inserted into enterovirus genome encodes an enzyme with deubiquitinase activity. the catalytic domains of these PLPs assume folds similar to the core papain fold. this is intriguing given that toroviruses belong to the Coronaviridae. tov-PLP and FMDV-Lpro contain additional acidic residues located immediately C terminal to the catalytic Asp residues. proteolytic target sequences may bind to the toV-PLP and FMDV-Lpro active sites in a different manner than the extended, flexible C-terminal sequences of ubiquitin/ISG15 that are also cleaved. the ubiquitin/ISG15 C termini may follow a path to the active site of toV-PLP and FMDV-Lpro. it is not yet clear exactly where the principal and/or secondary binding surfaces for the globular domains of polyubiquitin and ISG15 are located on the minimal catalytic domains of toV-PLP. a recombinant mutant virus was rescued in cell culture, suggesting that ToV-PLP is not absolutely essential for viral replication. a recombinant mutant virus was rescued in cell culture, suggesting that ToV-PLP is not absolutely essential for viral replication. infected ST or HEK-293T cells were maintained in 2% horse serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. fecal sample was obtained from a piglet diarrhea case submitted to KSVDL in 2015. isolated virus was plaque purified and designated EVG 08/NC_USA/2015. phylogeny was inferred by using the maximum likelihood algorithm. disorder prediction of the ToV-PLP sequence using GlobPlot (86) suggested that PLP is comprised primarily of a single core domain. 2 was constructed by RT-PCR amplification of the region spanning nt 1340 to 2218 of the PRRSV SD95-21 genome. the PCR products were cloned into a prokaryotic expression vector, pFLAG-CMV-24 (Sigma-Aldrich, MO), and designated pFLAG-ToV-PLP and pFLAG-PRRSV-PLP2 respectively. specific mutations in the catalytic sites
