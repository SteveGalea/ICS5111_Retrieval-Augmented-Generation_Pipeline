{"summary": "MERS-CoV has a large (about 30 kb) positive-sense RNA genome characteristic of coronaviruses, encoding conserved replicase and structural genes, and lineage-specific accessory genes are found in the 3\u2032 10 kb of the genome 4. this review will examine several of these areas to assess the state of the field as of mid-2017. seropositive rates among dromedary camels exceeding 90% have been detected in several sub-Saharan africa countries in addition to the Middle East. in 2016, sampling of more than 1,000 individuals in Kenya identified two seropositive individuals 6, although most of the individuals tested had little contact with camels. in 2013, ithete et al. 15 described a short, 816-nt fragment of coronavirus RNA isolated from a Neoromicia zuluensis bat in south africa that differed by only one amino acid from the equivalent MERS-CoV fragment. the virus shares 85% nt identity with MERS-CoV across the entire genome and more than 90% amino acid identity, placing the two viruses within the same species. seropositivity for MERS-CoV in dromedary camels dates back to 1983. in 2014, M\u00fcller et al. 25 reported 81% seropositivity for dromedary camels. this supports extensive circulation of MERS-CoV in dromedary camels long predating known human cases. autopsy report identifies type 2 alveolar pneumocytes and respiratory multinucleated syncytial cells of uncertain origin as primary targets of MERS-CoV. no evidence of systemic dissemination of MERS-CoV was found. lone autopsy report that MERS-CoV targets primarily alveolar pneumocytes. they conflict on whether lung endothelial cells are infected. this has been observed in cell culture and could facilitate systemic dissemination. the common marmoset appears to be a useful model organism for studying the pathogenesis of severe MERS-CoV disease. the rhesus macaque may be appropriate for studying milder, likely under-reported human disease as well as vaccine studies. both this group 35 and Yu et al. 36 have compared MERS-CoV infection of marmosets with that of rhesus macaques. they observed more severe disease, more robust viral replication, and more severe pathology and inflammatory cell lung infiltration in marmosets than in rhesus macaques. mouse models of MERS-CoV MERS-CoV do not replicate in mice. mouse DPP4 (mDPP4) does not support MERS-CoV entry 38. this is due to two amino acid differences relative to human DPP4 (DPP4) in the region that interacts with Spike 39. three models using transgenic mice that appear to better recapitulate severe human disease have been published. the first of these uses mice with the full-length mouse Dpp4 gene replaced by its human equivalent. these mice support robust MERS-CoV replication in the lungs. chimeric mDPP4 with substitutions of amino acids 288 and 330 were required to achieve lethality, significant declines in respiratory function, and severe lung pathology. despite the robust replication, 15 serial passages of virus were required to achieve lethality, significant declines in respiratory function, and severe lung pathology. nsp1 55, nsp3 papain-like protease domain 56, 57, and the structural M protein 58, 59 may also counteract the host immune response. the lineage-specific accessory proteins lack homology to known viral or host proteins, making them of particular interest. NS4a antagonism of IFN gene expression has been demonstrated by three research groups using very similar luciferase reporter assays 58, 60, 61. NS4a binds the dsRNA mimic polyI:C and co-localizes with dsRNA during actual virus infection. ectopically expressed NS4b inhibited IFN promoter-driven luciferase expression, a result confirmed by Yang et al. 63 in 2015. the authors identify, but do not characterize, an IFN antagonist function mediated specifically in the nucleus. no virus directly ancestral to MERS-CoV, or containing a Spike S1 subunit with high similarity to MERS-CoV, has been isolated or identified by sequence. a hallmark feature of a virus-reservoir host interaction is that for the virus to be maintained it should cause minimal to no disease in that host. the development of MERS-CoV mouse models is an impressive scientific achievement. differences in infection outcome between mice expressing hDPP4 and mice expressing chimeric DPP4s require further study. a side-by-side comparison of these models will help in elucidating and reconciling these differences. some studies using live virus are more cumbersome and require biosafety level-3 containment. the referees who approved the final version are listed with their names and affiliations but without their reports on earlier versions."}
