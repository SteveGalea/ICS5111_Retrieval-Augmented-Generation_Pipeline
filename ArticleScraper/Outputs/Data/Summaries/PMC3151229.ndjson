{"summary": "an individual space-time Activity-based Model (ISTAM) was applied to simulate the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical control measures including: (1) refraining from social activities, (2) school closure and (3) household quarantine, for a hypothetical influenza outbreak in an urban area. results Among the set of control measures tested, refraining from social activities with various compliance levels was relatively ineffective. avian influenza (bird flu) and H1N1 influenza (swine flu) have emerged repeatedly amongst the human population raising public concerns. the transmission of an infectious disease amongst the human population is a complex process involving the time lines of infectious diseases, infection probability, contacts between individuals, demographic dynamics that determine the contact pattern and the occasional imported infection. at both the micro (for a single infection) and macro levels there exist a plethora of factors, objects and processes that combine to create agent-based models (ABM) provide powerful means to increase understanding of infectious disease transmission. they are computational models for simulating the actions and interactions of autonomous individuals within a heterogeneous population. they can be applied to simulate the outbreak of infectious diseases and bio-terror attacks, and to explore the efficacy of control measures. the first two are straightforward and widely accepted by both the public and decision-making agents. the last two are controversial due to the high social and economic costs from closing schools and public places for certain periods. some research conclusions are contradictory. this paper presents an analysis in which control measures are tested for a hypothetical influenza outbreak in a small city in the Netherlands. ISTAM was applied to simulate an influenza outbreak for the same city in an earlier study. the analysis included the spatial distribution of infection within the city, infection distribution at different types of locations and network analysis. there are social rules for how close humans can approach each other. the values of the above distances vary between populations from different cultures, ages, genders etc. the model should focus on changing distances between individuals and, specifically, when the distances are small enough for infection. ISTAM was previously applied to simulate hypothetical influenza outbreaks. for the latter case, the first requirement was to build the population and the spatial structure of the city of Eemnes. properties such as family structure, number of cars and income level were assigned to every household. a series of compliance levels (25%, 50%, 75% and 100%) were tested for both A and H. the scenario with no control measures (denoted by N) was also tested for comparison purposes. on average, it took 31 days for the number of new infection cases to reach the peak, that is, 308 cases per day. the total number of cases during the outbreak was 5703. the total number of cases was 5703. 5240-5648 222 72.1 192-253 39 125.8 30-51 AH 50%, 50% 97 5000 87.7 4754-5244 243 78.9 209-276 35 112.9 23-51 HS 50%, 100% 97 4494 78.8 4219-4781 134 43.5 107-160 48 154.8 36-71 AHS 50%, 50%, 100% 97 4453 78.1 4008-4753 135 43.8 104-162 51 16 the three properties of the outbreak under each scenario are given in Table 1. the proportion of infected individuals was plotted against time in Figure 2 for scenarios N, S, H and SH. compliance level is 50% for H: the peak number. the effectiveness of S in reducing the total number of cases was small, a reduction of 4.2%. HS (and AHS) were the most effective control strategies. the peak number of cases decreased by 56% to 57%, the total number of cases decreased by 21% to 22%.

ISTAM was used to quantify the efficacy of three of the social control measures recommended by the CDC. model, analysed the results and drafted the paper.
