{"summary": "IAV2 is a common pathogen that causes respiratory tract infections and acute severe pneumonia. in response to viral infection, the host produces chemokines, proinflammatory cytokines, and immunoregulatory cytokines. the role of other cytokines or chemokines have also been investigated. IL-27 is composed of the T-cell cytokine receptor (TCCR/WSX-1) and the signal transducer glycoprotein 130. IL-27 activates the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, which drives rapid clonal expansion of naive but not memory CD4+ T cells. IL-27 synergizes with IL-12 to trigger IFN- production of naive CD4+ T cells. IL-27 is significantly up-regulated in IAV-infected lung epithelial cells and freshly isolated PBMCs. we also show that IAV triggers IL-27/EBI3 promoter activity and IL-27 expression through a protein kinase A (PKA)-CREB signaling pathway. circulating IL-27 levels are closely associated with PGE2 levels.

PBMCs infected with IAV expressed IL-27 in a time-dependent manner. IL-27 was significantly up-regulated at 6 h post-infection (hpi) the decrease of IL-27 expression was not caused by the decline of cell viability. mRNA levels of both EBI3 and P28 were significantly up-regulated at 6 hpi. however, the expression levels were still significantly up-regulated compared with 0 hpi. IL-27 levels (D) or two IL-27 subunits EBI3 (open bars) and P28 (solid bars) mRNA levels (E) were detected by real-time PCR. results are expressed as mean S.E. (n = 3) and from three independent experiments (*, p 0.05) luciferase assay results showed that truncation or mutation at the CREB site significantly reduced IL-27/EBI3 promoter activity induced by IAV. eNOS, whose expression is constitutive and CREB-dependent was used as a positive control. -27/EBI3-Luc and pRL-TK were co-transfected into A549 cells with various doses of siRNA that specifically bind CREB (800, 1000, or 1200 ng) or irrelevant siRNA control. cells were harvested and luciferase activity was measured. IL-27 expression induced by IAV was down-regulated. similar results were observed that IL-27 expression stimulated by IAV was down-regulated when PKA was knocked down by specific siRNA. smids pIL-27/EBI3-Luc and pRL-TK were then transfected into A549 cells with IAV infection at 1 m.o.i. after 48 h, cells were harvested and ELISA was conducted to measure IL-27. data are expressed as mean S.E. from three independent experiments. EGTA (0.5, 1, and 2 mm) or BAPTA/AM (2 mm) significantly reduced IL-27/EBI3 promoter activity resulting from IAV infection in A549 cells. EGTA (2 mm) reduced the expression of IL-27 from 289 22 to 117 38 pg/ml (p 0.05), whereas BAPTA/AM (2 mm) reduced the nuclear translocation of CREB in A549 cells. we then tested whether IL-27 expression and PKA-CREB signaling were dependent on COX-2 by administering the selective COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 during IAV infection of PBMCs or A549 cells. addition of PGE2 was able to compensate for NS-398-mediated inhibition, restoring expression of IL-27.

ELISA was performed to measure the IL-27 concentration in the culture supernatant. freshly isolated PBMCs were incubated for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C in 48-well plates. IL-27 levels (D) or two IL-27 subunits EBI3 and P28 mRNA levels (E) were detected by real-time PCR. the IL-27/EBI3 promoter contains several consensus cis-elements, including binding sites for NF-B, CREB, and AP1. the promoter reported in that study was short and lacked some cis-element information. we then transfected these plasmids into A549 cells, infected the cells with IAV. pIL-27/EBI3-Luc, a series of truncated or CREB-mutated promoter constructs, and pRL-TK were co-transfected into A549 cells. pRL-TK was used as internal control. IL-27 expression induced by IAV was down-regulated when PKA was knocked down by specific siRNA. pGL3-IL-27/EBI3 promoter activity was significantly decreased. IL-27 expression stimulated by IAV was down-regulated. A549 cells were pre-treated with one of several kinase specific inhibitors. pIL-27/EBI3-Luc and pRL-TK were then transfected with IAV. after 48 h, cells were harvested and luciferase activity was measured. blot is representative of three experiments with similar results. densitometric analysis relative to lamin A levels were expressed as fold-change. calcium influx has been reported to play an important role in mediating PKA/CREB activation.

IL-27 Inhibits IAV Replication through Activation of PKR. recombinant IL-27 (50 ng/ml) for 12 h before IAV infection (m.o.i. = 1).

ELISA was used to quantify IL-27 levels in serum samples from 115 healthy individuals, 20 patients infected with 2009 pandemic H1N1 and 85 patients infected with seasonal H3N2. each sample was tested in duplicate. data supporting previously unrecognized mechanism for IL-27 expression in response to IAV infection. IL-27/P28 is induced more quickly than IL-27/EBI3 for about 12 h. peak of EBI3 expression is at 24 h, a time point where IL-27 secretion is declining. IL-35 may compete with IL-27, a subunit of which is also EBI3. EB are among the host factors required for influenza virus replication. the PKA-CREB signaling pathway is also functional in IAV-mediated IL-27/EBI3 promoter activation and IL-27 expression. ERK can also activate CREB signaling as PKA does. IL-27/EBI3 promoter activation and IL-27 expression are activated during IAV infection. calcium-PKA-CREB and COX-2/PGE2-PKA-CREB signaling pathways are activated during IAV infection, leading to IL-27/EBI3 promoter activation and IL-27 expression. the antiviral role of IL-27 has been demonstrated in HIV and HCV infections.
