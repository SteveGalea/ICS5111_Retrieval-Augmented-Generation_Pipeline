{"summary": "the paramyxoviridae subfamily includes parainfluenza viruses (PIVs), measles virus (MV), mumps virus (MuV), Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus (HeV), while the Pneumovirinae subfamily includes respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and metapneumovirus (MPV) the 15.2 kb RSV genome is composed of 10 genes arranged sequentially on the template that encodes for 11 proteins. the large polymerase protein (L), the phosphoprotein (P) and the nucleoprotein (N) form the helical ribonucleoprotein complex which encapsidates the genomic RNA. replication are regulated by a unique promoter in the 3\u2032 leader (Le) region. the RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase composed of L and P proceeds directly from the negative sense (3\u2032-5\u2032) genome through the production of capped/polyA monocistronic mRNAs. SV has evolved mechanisms to hijack the IFN antiviral response. this includes the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, the stress granule response, and oxidative stress. the ER is a cellular organelle essential for the control of several cellular functions. RSV-mediated activation of ER stress has been shown in primary human tracheobronchial epithelial cells and in the A549 cell line. the response is associated with an incremental induction of the ER chaperones, binding immunoglobulin protein (GRP78) and calnexin, and caspase 12. the exact mechanism triggering ER stress during RSV infection remains elusive. an early event required for the activation of the UPR response is the dissociation of ATF6/IRE1/PERK from the BiP/GRP78 [20,21] this is a likely mechanism that might at least in part contribute to RSV-induced UPR response. virroporins alter ER function in infected cells through the induction of ER Ca2+ leakage. ER stress induction is associated with activation of the inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) and activated transcription factor 6 (ATF6) branches of the unfolded protein response. increased protein folding and degradation capacity are induced as a result of X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) splicing variant XBP1s production by IRE1 endonuclease activity and IRE1-endonuclease activity. IRE1 appears to act as a restriction factor during RSV infection [25]. IRE1-dependent mRNA decay may result from the nuclease activity of IRE1 that promotes the degradation of specific mRNAs to alleviate the rate of mRNA translation. additional functions of IRE1 involve its kinase activity, which is known to trigger a TRAF2/ASK1/MAPK signaling cascade. IRE1 is generally known to induce pro-survival autophagy through mechanisms involving XBP1 splicing and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation. however, during RSV infection, the IRE1 branch exhibits intricate regulatory interactions with autophagy. this suggests that autophagy contributes to a negative feedback loop to lessen the RSV-induced ER stress response. SGs were consistently detected in a maximum of 30% of RSV-infected Hep-2 or A549 cells up to 24 h post-infection. ssRNA transiently localizes within SGs, but is mainly associated in IBs. the 5\u2019 extragenic trailer sequence (5\u2019 Tr) of the RSV genome interferes with SG assembly. eIF2 phosphorylation is limited by the interaction of RSV N with PKR. a possible mechanism is that the Tr region binds to the TIA1-related protein involved in SG assembly. a thorough quantification of RSV-induced SG formation in the absence of TIAR is required to conclude appropriately on TIAR/5\u2032 Tr interaction as an interference mechanism. the incapacity of RSV to fully inhibit SG formation might reflect the lack of expression of the C protein from the RSV genome. cytoplasmic IBs are sites of N, P, L, M2-1 accumulation, which is consistent with a role in the viral ribonucleocapsid assembly and viral RNA synthesis and replication. occurrence of cytoplasmic IBs observed at an early stage of RSV infection seems to prevent the formation of SGs. low ROS levels act as redox switch for cellular signaling cascades. oxidative stress refers to the damaging side of excessive ROS levels. RNA virus-induced oxidative stress contributes to cell death and loss of immune function. stress marker levels in the lung and blood were positively correlated with the severity of the bronchiolitis [73,74]. oxidative stress markers MDA and 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) are increased in the bronchoalveolar lavages of RSV-infected mice [72]. a mouse model of RSV infection also showed a decline in the active levels of SOD 1-3, catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), GST, peroxiredoxin (Prx) 6, heme oxygenase 1 (OH-1) and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) at a late time of infection [73]. nuclear histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity is upregulated leading to nuclear Nrf2 deacetylation and proteasome-mediated degradation. blocking HDAC activity using trichostatin A increases Nrf2 acetylation and prevents its degradation, thereby restoring RSV-induced AOE gene expression. ROS act as a redox switch required for efficient RSV-mediated activation of the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-B), activator protein-1 (AP-1) and interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 3 activation pathways and downstream IL-8, CCL5/RANTES and CCL2/monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) transcriptional expression [86,87,88,89,90,91 despite decades of research, an integrated picture of RSV-host interaction is still missing. the role of the ATF6 branch of the UPR and whether/how it synergize with the antiviral function of the IRE1 pathway remains unknown. a detailed analysis of the kinetics of SG formation/dissociation throughout the course of RSV infection has not been addressed. a bimodal effect of the oxidative stress response is observed during RSV infection. the identification of NOX2 and DUOX2 as sources of ROS and Nrf2 as a major culprit in the downregulation of the antioxidant defense."}
