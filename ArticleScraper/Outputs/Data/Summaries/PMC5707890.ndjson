{"summary": "polio, measles, diphtheria, haemophilus influenzae type B and rubella are common infectious diseases. vaccine development in the twenty-first century has changed greatly over the past 30 years from an empirical approach to one that is rational and supported by both basic and applied science. however, there has been a continual increase in quantity and quality of data needed to support the vaccine development pathway. there have been more veterinary vaccinology success stories with over 300 vaccines licensed around the world. this situation is made even more difficult by society\u2019s expectations that a vaccine must be 100% effective, 150% safe and cost US$1 (or less for veterinary vaccines) development and testing of vaccines in 2014\u20132015 is one that immediately comes to mind. it is not just a case of \u2018research and development\u2019 of a vaccine, there is also the question of educating people to take a vaccine, particularly new ones. 20 years of preclinical development can be rapidly translated into clinical evaluation with the joint efforts of funders, developers and regulators. ebola in 2014\u20132015 has been replaced by Zika in 2015\u20132016. the progress on this emerging disease has been nothing short of amazing. there is no doubt emerging diseases will continue to be public health threats in the future. major efforts are in stockpiling vaccines, which will be replenished at the end of their shelf life if they are not used. non-infectious disease vaccine research is focused on \u2018difficult\u2019 childhood diseases and the application of childhood vaccines to adults and the elderly. npj Vaccines is a multidisciplinary journal dedicated to publishing the finest, high-quality research and development on human and veterinary vaccines. the goal of npj Vaccines is to highlight the most important scientific advances in human and veterinary vaccine research and development. pandemic H1N1 influenza vaccine and an associated comment.11,12 We are encouraged by the high quality of the content of papers received to date."}
