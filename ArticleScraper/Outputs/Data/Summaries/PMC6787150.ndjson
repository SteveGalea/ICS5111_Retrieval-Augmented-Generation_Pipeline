{"summary": "development of antiviral resistance of hepatitis C virus (HCV), influenza A virus (IAV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other viruses is a major concern. the world health organization (WHO) and the united nations have urged for better control of viral diseases. meta-analysis of host-virus protein-protein interactions of multiple viruses and functional RNAi screens would provide novel insights for developing broad-spectrum antiviral strategies. for this, we assembled a host-virus protein-protein interactome of 5,781 host-virus interactions (hereafter called \u201chvPPI\u201d) covering 183 viral proteins from 17 different viruses and 2,381 host proteins. works were extracted using the Cytoscape plugin MCODE. gene-set enrichment analysis was performed using IUPred2A software. annotation of human proteins was mapped from UniProt ID to ENSEMBL. approximately 4 104 human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells were seeded per well in 96-well plates. the cells were grown for 24 h in DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 0.35% NaHCO3, and 100 g/ml streptomicine. effectiveness of the drug was quantified as the selectivity index ( S I = C C 50 E C 50 ). hvPPI Data, Network Analysis, and Data Visualization Host-virus protein interactions were downloaded from published studies (15\u201317, 25, 31\u201334) protein identifiers were mapped to UniProt IDs. localization of host targets was mapped using COMPARTMENTS (39), filtered for a minimum evidence score of 3 in the knowledge channel, excluding non-experimental based localization predictions. evidence for all protein was divided by the absolute number of host-targets per viral protein. the compounds were added to the cells in 3-fold dilutions at seven different concentrations starting from 50 M. the cells were mock- or virus-infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of one. after 48 h of infection, the medium was removed from the cells. hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1), human papilloma virus 8 (HPV8), human papilloma virus 11 (HPV11), human papilloma virus 16 (HPV16), human papilloma virus 18 (HPV18), human papilloma virus 33 (HPV33), Merkel cell polyomavirus 40 (SV40), and Vaccinia virus ( this topological property shows how viruses having small genomes achieve the maximum effect in rewiring the human interactome to benefit viral survival and replication. we propose that this could be a general principle for all viruses. a statistically significant enrichment (p-value 6.246 1006) of IDRs in the host proteins targeted by viruses. the top five proteins with large IDRs include CD44 antigen (CD44), Serine/arginine repetitive matrix protein 2 (SRRM2), BAG family molecular chaperone regulator 3 (BAG3) and Mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS). in the hvPPI, MAVS is targeted by several proteins from dsDNA viruses such as EBV and HPV. the IDR-high part of the human proteome is an essential part of the viral evasion strategy. however, the very flexible protein structure of disordered proteins also makes them also difficult to target with drugs. hvPPI includes two different strains of IAV\u2013 PR8 (H1N1) and Udorn (H3N2) the hvPPI includes two different strains of IAV\u2013 PR8 (H1N1) and Udorn (H3N2). NS1 of Udorn has a histone mimicry motif that suppresses host antiviral response. er targets common to HPV18 and HPV11 E5 protein were enriched for unfolded protein response, N-linked glycosylation and protein folding involving host proteins. the non-canonical function of STT3A and STT3B is required for DENV replication. the non-canonical function of STT3A and STT3B is required for DENV replication and that NS1 protein of DENV interacts with these proteins. top 50 proviral genes are also targeted by the viral proteins. hvPPI is one of the three vesicular carrier systems involved in the early secretory pathway (70\u201372) azacytidine, lopinavir, nitazoxanide, itraconazole, oritavancin, dibucaine, gefitinib, minocycline, and pirlindole mesylate are novel anti-HCV agents with SI > 3. azacytidine, lopinavir, nitazoxanide, itraconazole, and oritavancin are novel anti-HCV our meta-analysis approach of the hvPPI could provide novel and faster approaches for the re-purposing of existing drugs as antiviral agents. the measurements were repeated three times (p0.05). evasion mechanisms we performed a meta-analysis of the host-virus interaction landscape. this dataset covered 17 different viruses including adeno-associated virus 5 (AAV5), dengue virus (DENV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), influenza A virus PR8 (IAV-PR8), influenza virus Udorn (IAV-Udorn), hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1), human papillo the context of the human protein interactome examined two important parameters. the targets of all the viruses showed higher betweenness centrality and degree as compared to an average protein in the human interactome. this shows that viruses, by targeting \u201chubs\u201d and proteins that serves as key communication nodes, have evolved the best way to disrupt the scale-free human interactome. we analyzed the host proteins from the hvPPI for presence of IDRs using the prediction software IUPred (56) it is estimated that the human proteome more than 100,000 short linear binding motifs in IDRs (57, 58) NS1 protein from influenza B virus has also been reported to interact with SRRM2 (64). protein of the MARCKS family are involved in a range of cellular processes including cell adhesion and migration (65). we identified highly connected subnetworks within the hvPPI network. we constructed a host\u2013host interaction network based on the host targets in the hvPPI and identified a number of highly connected subnetworks/clusters. we then performed a gene-set enrichment analysis of significantly enriched biological processes. non-structural protein 1 (NS1) from both strains had the highest number of nuclear targets. NS1 of Udorn was enriched for a large number of histones compared to NS1 of PR8 that had large number of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins. this corroborates with the observation that NS1 protein has short linear histone mimicry motifs that suppress the host antiviral response. two independent CRISPR/Cas9 screening studies identified multiple ER associated components including STT3A and STT3B. the non-canonical function of STT3A and STT3B is required for DENV replication and that NS1 protein of DENV interacts with these proteins. host targets from the hvPPI were spread across the spectrum of genes with proviral as well as antiviral phenotype. we then investigated the top 50 proviral genes that are also targeted by the viral proteins as seen in the hvPPI. top hits including the COPI system could serve as targets for developing therapeutic antiviral intervention strategies for a broad group of viruses. top proviral genes from RNAi screens also targeted by multiple viral proteins. our test identified azithromycin, cidofovir, oritavancin, dibucaine, gefitinib, minocycline, and pirlindole mesylate as novel anti-HCV agents with SI > 3. hvPPI could provide novel and faster approaches for the re-purposing existing drugs as antiviral agents. our analysis of the hvPPI network revealed that all viruses have evolved to target proteins that are central and have strong control over the human interactome. hvPPI data-based drug re-purposing screen identified novel activities for various broad-spectrum antivirals against HMPV and HCV. further detailed analysis would provide novel insights as well as deeper understanding of how small sequence features are involved in the hijacking of the host machinery. integration of such data with known drug-gene interactions provides a clear estimate of the druggable proportion in the hvPPI. we tested 40 BSAs against HMPV, HCV, Sindbis virus (SINV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and hepatitis B virus (HBV). dibucaine is an FDA-approved amide local anesthetic. it is experimental anti-HEV-A, HEV-B, HEV-D, and EBOV agent. it has also antiviral activity against BKV, CMV, and VACV. the most effective and tolerable compounds could expand the available therapeutics for the treatment of viral diseases, improving preparedness and the protection of the general population from viral epidemics and pandemics. all authors contributed, read, and approved the manuscript. conflict of interest Statement The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
