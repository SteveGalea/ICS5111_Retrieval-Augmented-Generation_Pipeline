{"summary": "RESULTS Recombinant RBD proteins of representative human and camel MERS-CoV strains in 2012 to 2015 maintained good conformation and antigenicity. the mutations are summarized in Table 1. s 400 424 431 434 457 460 482 506 509 510 511 513 513 520 522 530 534 582 EMC-RBD 2012 Human K T A A S S A L D D D R E A Q V V V N 2012-RBD 2012 Human F G A 3 2013-RBD 2013 Human P V F V I 5 2014-RBD 2014 Human I H 2 2015-RBD 2015 Human G RBD-FGGAA 2012 Human F G 5 2015 ELISA plates were coated with respective human and camel RBD proteins or human Fc (hIgG-Fc) control. they then incubated with neutralizing mouse MAb Mersmab1 and human MAbs m336, m337, and m338 (1.25 g/ml) the data are presented as mean A450 standard deviation (SD) (n =4) of RBDs binding to MAbs. hDPP4 in the absence of RBD was recognized only by anti-hDPP4 antibody, not by anti-MERS-CoV-RBD antibody. rRBD proteins of representative human and camel MERS-CoV strains in 2012 to 2015 bound efficiently to soluble and cell-associated hDPP4 receptors. rRBD proteins (40 g/ml) or hIgG-Fc control and FITC-labeled anti-human IgG antibody followed by analysis for binding. data are presented as means SD (n = 4) of RBD binding to hDPP4 receptor. ELISA and flow cytometry assays were then carried out to quantify binding between RBD and DPP4. 2013-RBD still elicited strong IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies specific to S1 of the EMC2012 strain. phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) control induced only background levels of MERS-CoV-specific antibody. we then tested the ability of the aforementioned RBD-immunized mouse sera to prevent infection of these pseudoviruses in Huh-7 cells. all pseudoviruses efficiently expressed MERS-CoV RBD and HIV-1 p24, which are recognized by anti-RBD antibody (Fig. 4A), and had sufficient infectivity in hDPP4-expressing Huh-7 cells. packaged MERS pseudoviruses were tested for expression of MERS-CoV S and HIV-1 p24 proteins by Western blotting using anti-MERS-CoV RBD (1:1,000, top) and anti-HIV-1 p24 antibodies. Detection of infectivity of MERS pseudoviruses in DPP4-expressing Huh-7 cells. we generated 5 pseudoviruses expressing S proteins of MAb escape mutants with single or multiple mutations in RBD (Fig. 4) (31\u201334) and examined their sensitivity to the antibodies generated in the aforementioned RBD-immunized mice. except for 2013-RBD, which induced a slightly lower level of neutralizing antibodies, all other RBDs, including EMC-RBD, 2012-RBD, 2014-RBD, 2015-RBD, and Camel-RB ERS-CoV strains EMC2012 and London1-2012 were immunized in 2012 (1, 39) all RBDs, including EMC-RBD, 2012-RBD, 2013-RBD, 2014-RBD, 2015-RBD, and Camel-RBD, induced cross-neutralizing antibodies against both human MERS-CoV strains. RBDs with single or multiple natural mutations derived from representative strains in 2012 to 2015 had no significant changes in antigenicity, functionality, and neutralizing immunogenicity. to test whether deliberate mutation of multiple key residues in the RBM would affect hDPP4-binding ability, we expressed two additional mutant proteins, RBD-FGG and RBD-FGGAA. EMC-RBD wild-type (WT) was included as a control. the data are presented as means SD (n = 4) of each RBD (40 g/ml) binding to hDPP4 or cDPP4 protein in Huh-7 cells. mutant and WT pseudoviruses were significantly inhibited from entering Huh-7 cells. these mutant pseudoviruses were significantly inhibited from entering Huh-7 cells. the MERS-CoV RBD with mutations of multiple key residues in the RBM showed reduced antigenicity and neutralizing immunogenicity. serum IgG antibody titers are expressed as the endpoint dilutions that remain positively detectable. ND50 and NT50 represent the 50% neutralizing dose (for MAbs) and 50% neutralizing antibody titers (for sera) the results showed that pseudoviruses with these mutations were significantly less sensitive to neutralization than wild-type pseudoviruses. similar results were obtained when the pseudoviruses were exposed to mouse sera containing polyclonal neutralizing antibodies. the five mutants of native (nonboiled) proteins had twice the molecular mass of those that were boiled (denatured) proteins. all RBD proteins of human and camel MERS-CoVs reacted strongly with antibodies targeting the RBD of MERS-CoV EMC2012. key residues in the RBM of the RBD are in bold. ELISA plates were coated with respective human and camel RBD proteins or human Fc (hIgG-Fc) control and then incubated with neutralizing mouse MAb Mersmab1 and human MAbs m336, m337, and m338 (1.25 g/ml), which recognize conformational epitopes in MERS-CoV EMC2012. all mutant and wild-type rBDs bound strongly to mouse MAb Mersmab1 and human MAbs m336, m337, and m338. a coimmunoprecipitation assay was initially performed to identify whether the rRBD proteins of representative human and camel MERS-CoV strains could bind to DPP4 receptor. ELISA plates were coated with hDPP4 or cDPP4 protein (2 g/ml) and then incubated with dilutions of rRBD proteins or hIgG-Fc control. the data are presented as means SD (n = 4) of RBD binding to hDPP4 or cDPP4 protein. results from flow cytometry analysis also revealed strong binding of these rRBD proteins to the hDPP4 receptor. results confirm binding specificity and potency between human or camel MERS-CoV RBDs and the hDPP4 receptor. the antibody titers are expressed as the endpoint dilutions that remain positively detectable. they are presented as mean antibody titers SD for five mice in each group. 2012-RBD, 2013-RBD, 2014-RBD, 2015-RBD represent MERS-CoV strains isolated from humans in 2012 to 2015 and from camels. the RBDs of human MERS-CoV isolates elicited similarly high titers of neutralizing antibodies against these pseudoviruses. 2013-RBD contains 5 mutations in multiple sites of RBD from 4 human MERS-CoV strains in 2013. however, these antibodies could still efficiently cross-neutralize all MERS pseudoviruses tested. sera of mice immunized with EMC-RBD (A), 2012-RBD (B), 2013-RBD (C), 2014-RBD (D), 2015-RBD (E), Camel-RBD (F), or PBS control (A) were collected at 10 days after the third immunization and analyzed. Neutralizing activity was expressed as 50% neutralizing antibody titers (NT50) MERS pseudoviruses expressing RBD MAb escape variants were generated as specified above and tested for cross-neutralizing ability of human and camel RBD proteins. sera of mice immunized with EMC-RBD (A), 2012-RBD (B), 2013-RBD (C), 2014-RBD (D), 2015-RBD (E), or PBS control (A) were collected at 10 days after the third immunization and analyzed. human and camel MERS-CoV RBD proteins induced cross-neutralizing antibodies against different human MERS-CoVs. mice were immunized with the indicated RBD or PBS as a control. sera were collected at 10 days after the third immunization. the results revealed that RBD-FGG and RBD-FGGAA exhibited significantly reduced binding activity to recombinant hDPP4 (Fig. 8B), cDPP4 (Fig. 8C), and cell-associated hDPP4 (Fig. 8D) proteins. the effects most obvious when 5 residues were mutated. the data are presented as means SD (n = 4) of each RBD (40 g/ml) binding to hDPP4 in Huh-7 cells. the infectivity of EMC2012 WT pseudovirus in Huh-7 cells was set as 100% entry. ELISA plates were precoated with rRBD proteins (1 g/ml) binding was detected using rBD-specific neutralizing MAbs Mersmab1 and m336 (1.25 g/ml) binding was detected using RBD-specific neutralizing MAbs Mersmab1 and m336 (1.25 g/ml) (A) antibody titers are expressed as mean SD for five mice in each group. the neutralizing antibody titers are expressed as mean NT50 SD for five mice in each group. DISCUSSION Development of safe, effective, and broad-spectrum vaccines is urgently needed to combat the continuing threat posed by MERS-CoV. compared with other vaccine types, including those based on viruses and viral vectors, subunit vaccines are safer since viral genomic components are absent. mel-RBD contain single or multiple mutations in the RBD of representative MERS-CoV strains isolated from humans and camels in 2012 to 2015. all five mutant RBDs maintained good conformation and antigenicity, reacting strongly with polyclonal and MAb neutralizing antibodies that recognize neutralizing epitopes in the RBD of strain EMC2012. antibody titers of 1:119 completely protect highly susceptible hDPP4-transgenic (hDPP4-Tg) mice from lethal MERS-CoV challenge. all of them induced neutralizing antibody titers of 1:120 against two live MERS-CoV strains (EMC2012 and London1-2012) two additional key residues in the RBM are also responsible for virus-DPP4 binding and play a role in inducing MAb escape mutant virus strains. simultaneous mutations of these three or five key residues in the RBM of the RBD led to significant changes in the neutralizing immunogenicity of MERS-CoV RBD. viral S protein since decreased neutralization is accompanied by reduced binding to DPP4. rRBD proteins covering different mutations in the RBD of MERS-CoV that circulated during the course of the 2012-2015 outbreaks. key residues in the RBM of the RBD were demonstrated. their antigenicity to bind MERS-CoV RBD-specific neutralizing antibodies was demonstrated. this study also explored the broad-spectrum capability of the RBDs containing naturally scattered mutations. id was used to generate 2012-RBD, 2013-RBD, 2014-RBD, 2015-RBD, and Camel-RBD with point or multiple natural mutations. id was used to generate RBD-FGG and RBD-FGGAA with simultaneous multiple mutations of key RBM residues. expression of MERS-CoV spike and HIV-1 p24 in generated pseudoviruses was identified by Western blotting.
