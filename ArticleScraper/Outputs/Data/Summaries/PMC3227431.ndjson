{"summary": "the human zona pellucida (hZP) is an extracellular matrix surrounding eggs. it consists of four sulfated glycoproteins designated as ZP1, ZP2, ZP3 and ZP4. hZP glycoproteins mediate several critical events during fertilization process. five BCE peptides45\u201364, 93\u2013110, 137\u2013150, 172\u2013190 and 334\u2013341 of hZP3 have been mapped [15\u201317]. additional two epitopes corresponding to aa residue 23\u201330 and 301\u2013320 of hZP3 have also been predicted. the identification of minimal motif of mapped BCEs on hZP3 has been hampered. the sera against r-hZP322\u2013176 (hZP3a) and r-hZP3177\u2013348 (hZP3b) were made, which reacted with human oocyte [21]. the immunogenicity of two chemically synthesized peptides171\u2013186 and 301\u2013315 of hZP3 conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) has also been evaluated in rabbits. peptide P3 was used as unrelated control peptide in ELISA. a set of biosynthetic peptides (numbering P4\u2013P11) corresponding to P4 (QPLWLLQG), P5 (ECQEATLMVMVSKDLPGTGK), P6 (EVGLHECGNSMQVTDDAL), P7 (PIECRYPRQGNVSS), P8 (FSLRLMEENW), P9 (SFSKPSNS protein were transformed into the BL21(DE3)(pLysS) E. coli strain. each recombinant clone was first grown in 3 mL of Luria Broth (LB) containing 100 g mL1 ampicillin at 30\u00b0C with continuous shaking at 200 rpm overnight. next day, 60 L of cell suspension was inoculated in 3 mL of fresh LB and grown until the cell density reached 0.6\u20130.8 at rabbit antisera against r-hZP3a and r-hZP3b (1 : 300 dilution in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 1% skim milk powder) or immune sera against P1 or P2 (1 : 2000 dilution). blot was developed by using 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine (DAB) in 50 mM PBS containing 0.05% H2O2. nonimmune sera from two animals (number 077-078) who only received CFA and P3 as unrelated peptide antigen were used as negative controls in the ELISA. unbound synthetic peptide was washed off with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) human oocytes that had failed to fertilize during in vitro fertilization were kindly donated. a signed written consent for use of oocytes was obtained from all participants. oocytes were washed thrice with PBS containing 1 mg mL1 of polyvinylalcohol. Peptides FSLRLMEENWNAEKRS (P1) and SFSKPSNSWFPVEGP (P2) corresponding to hZP3172\u2013187 and hZP3301\u2013315 as well as PETQPGPLTLELQIAKDK (P3) corresponding to hZP4308\u2013325 were produced on an APEX396 synthesizer by Sangon Co. (Shanghai, China) annealed DNA fragments encoding each P4 to P46 peptides corresponding to the hZP3 cDNA sequence [22] were inserted into the BamH I and Sal I sites downstream of the Stv108 or GST188 gene. the resultant recombinant plasmids expressing each target short peptide fused with Stv108 or GST188 protein were transformed into the BL21(DE3)(pLysS) E. coli SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting Cell pellets obtained from 3 mL culture were boiled in 400 L of 1x sample loading buffer for 5 min. gels either stained with Coomassie brilliant blue G-250 for analyzing bands of fusion proteins or processed for Western blot by electrotransferring proteins onto 0.2 m nitrocellulose membrane. six rabbits weighing 2.0 0.5 kg were immunized intramuscularly with 0.5 mg of chemically synthesized peptide P1 or P2 conjugated with KLH (Sigma) the animals were boosted three times intramuscularly with 0.25 mg of same peptide antigen emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant (Sigma) at multiple sites on the rabbit's back. all wells were treated with 0.4 mg mL1 o-phenylenediamine and 0.015% (v/v) H2O2 after washing as before and the reaction was stopped with H2SO4. the same amount of unrelated P3 synthetic peptide was used for coating the wells. rabbit preimmune serum was also used as negative control 2.6.2. oocytes were treated with 1 : 500 dilution of Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen, Calif, USA) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. after washing, the treated oocytes in PBS-PVA were examined under a Nikon TE300 inverted microscope. human oocytes that had failed to fertilize during in vitro fertilization were kindly donated. a signed written consent for use of oocytes was obtained from all participants. 301\u2013320 BCE peptides could be recognized by rabbit sera to r-hZP3a and r-hZP3b. the peptides fused with truncated GST188 were constructed with DNA recombinant technology. the electrophoretic mobilities of some short peptides did not seem to match their molecular weight. the results confirmed three BCE peptides (P6, P9, and P11) of hZP3 out of five BCE peptides identified previously. all three predicted BCE peptides also reacted with antibodies against r-hZPa/r-hZP3b. the synthetic 6/8mer peptide sequences from hZP3 protein are 100% conserved in mZP3 and hZP3 at the amino acid level. however, they did not generate a blotted brown band at the position of Stv108-P8 fusion protein when initially using DAB coloration due to its relatively lower sensitivity. a set of P4\u2013P11 peptides fused with GST188 was again constructed, which were suited to chemo peptides P8 and P9 were recognized by serum to r-hZP3b. so, the minimal motif178\u2013181 of peptide P9 was finally defined. each rabbit (number 073-074 and number 075-076) was immunized with synthetic peptide P1 or P2 antigen. the serum against P1 did not react with Stv108 and GST188 carrier proteins. so does the serum against P2 (data not shown) suggesting there was no cross-reactive antibodies with Stv108 and GST188 proteins in their immune sera. rabbit serum to P1 or P2 diluted to 1 : 50 showed a strong positive reaction with the human ZP. g\u2013j matching light images for the human oocytes imaged by immunofluorescence in panels g\u2013j. representative immunofluorescence patterns are shown for (g) preimmune serum; (h) immune serum only received CFA (i-j) immune serum to P1 or P2. Western blotting of each BCE peptide using a mixture of sera to r-hZP3a and r-hZP3b. the results confirmed three BCE peptides (P6, P9, and P11) of hZP3 out of five peptides identified previously. to P46 peptides were expressed in E. coli at a higher level. three (b-c), two (d), as well as four and six (e) overlapping 6\u20138mer peptides fused with GST188 were recognized by serum against r-hZP3a or r-hZP3b. these 36 constructs shared sequences of 6 aa (P4 and P6), 7 aa (P9), as well as 5 aa the mapped epitope sequence171\u2013180 of mZP3 [25] is 100% conserved among mZP3 and hZP3 at the amino acid level. however, they did not generate a blotted brown band at the position of Stv108-P8 fusion protein when initially using DAB coloration due to its relatively lower sensitivity. therefore, a set of P4\u2013P11 peptides fused with GST188 was again constructed, which were the antibody levels were determined by ELISA using synthetic P1 () and P2 () peptide as antigens. normal rabbit serum () and or P3 (not shown) were used as negative controls. the antibody levels were determined using synthetic P1 () and P2 () peptide as antigens. hZP3 protein has been an interesting target antigen for the development of a contraceptive peptide vaccine. two BCEs137\u2013150 and 334\u2013341 on hZP3 were first identified with serum to each synthetic peptide. ELISA suggests that it might not be a self-epitope peptide of hZP3. it could elicit antibodies capable of binding to native mstZP, bmZP, and hZP. the antiserum might be used as a marker for the identification of hZP3 protein. 301\u2013320 is highly conserved between mstZP3 and bmZP3 sequences. the bm-serum to bmZP3300\u2013322 conjugated to diphtheria toxoid failed to show any significant decrease in sperm-zona binding in hemizona assay. the Western blotting was carried out with two sets of 8 mer peptides (P27P33 and P34P46) the rabbit serum to P1 could recognize peptides P28 and P29. the serum to P2 only recognized peptides P42 and P43, but did not recognize other peptides (P43\u2013P46) reacted with serum to r-hZP3b. some studies on expression of single 4\u201312mer BCE peptides fused with Stv118 core protein [34] and epitope mapping with several purified short peptides fused with GST226 [35, 36], suggested the possibility of using biosynthetic peptides to map linear BCEs on a protein. however, not like the above studies using mAb, chicken sera to SARS-CoV, and SARS convalescent sera, it needs to solve a blotted bands of the GST188-short peptides were to be located in a weak antigenic area of bacterial proteins on blotted membrane. this avoided two blotted bands of bacterial protein with 21 kDa and 31 kDa bands. this study is the first to use biosynthetic peptides and sera against r-hZP3a and/or r-hZP3b to map BCEs and their minimal suggest that the biosynthetic peptide strategy used in this study could be used to map all BCEs and precise linear epitopes on other entire ZP proteins."}
