{"summary": "both the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as an essential receptor for cell entry. ACE2 is present in the vesicular endothelial cells of all organs, but these viruses are highly pathogenic only in the lungs. the distribution of ACE2 does not strictly correlate with viral cell tropism. TMPRSS2 enhances the release of viral particles into the culture fluid (25) in contrast, SARS-CoV spike (S) protein is predicted to be cleaved by TMPRSS2 following receptor binding for virus cell entry. the multiple protease cleavage sites within the SARS-S protein are reportedly located closer to the C-terminal region than other coronaviruses. the aim of the present study was to identify an inhibitor of TMPRSS2 from commercial drugs that could prevent SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63 infection in cell culture as well as in humans. the study was to identify an inhibitor of TMPRSS2 from commercial drugs that could prevent SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63 infection. the cDNA fragment of the full-size S protein was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR and cloned into the mammalian expression vector pTargeT. the transfection reagent (Mirus Bio, Madison, WI) was used to transfect 293T/17 cells, obtained from the ATCC (CRL-11268) with the expression plasmid, followed by incubation at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. 103 IU of virus was then used to infect 105 cells in the presence of the inhibitors. the cells were then cultured at 37\u00b0C for 20 h. mRNAs for ACE2, HAT, and TMPRSS2 were compared in Calu-3 cells and human lung cells. human lung cell total RNA was isolated from three male and three female Caucasians ages 32 to 61 years. PCR analysis was performed in a lightCycler instrument. the mRNA copy number was calculated based on a calibration line obtained by 10-fold stepwise dilution of plasmid DNA. Knockdown of TMPRSS2 or HAT was estimated by real-time PCR. the mRNA9 of HCoV-NL63 was amplified using the oligonucleotide pair 5\u2032-CTCGATCTCTCTTGTAGATCTG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-TCTAAGTTCCTCCTCTTGCCAT-3\u2032. hybridization was detected with the probes 5\u2032-TTATTACCCTCTCTCTCTCTACTC-3\u2032 (3\u2032-FITC labeled) and 5\u2032-CCAAAACAGCGCCGACCCCAAGGTTTA Authentic SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63 were inoculated onto HeLa-ACE2 and HeLa-ACE2-TMPRSS2 (black bars) cells. infectivity was quantified by real-time PCR to measure viral mRNA9 of these viruses. Calu-3 cells were infected with SARS-CoV at an MOI of 0.01 for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. five hours later, cellular RNA was isolated and infectivity was quantified by real-time PCR. mRNA levels for a housekeeping gene (GAPDH) and for the virus receptor were measured to evaluate the nontoxicity of camostat and EST in the same Calu-3 cells. mRNA9 using real-time PCR as previously described (20). cells expressing both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (HeLa-ACE2) were prepared by transfecting the cells with a plasmid harboring the human ACE2 gene. the cells were grown and maintained in modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Nissui, Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FCS) the cDNA fragment of the full-size S protein was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and cloned into the mammalian expression vector pTargeT. the transfection reagent (Mirus Bio, Madison, WI) was used to transfect 293T/17 cells. the cells were then infected with VSV[Delta]G-G, which encodes the VSV-G protein. 103 IU of virus was used to infect 105 cells in the presence of the inhibitors. the cells were then cultured at 37\u00b0C for 20 h. human lung cell total RNA was isolated from three male and three female Caucasians ages 32 to 61 years. the TMPRSS2 mRNA fragment was amplified using the oligonucleotide pair 5\u2032-CTCTACGGACCAAACTTCATC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CCACTATTCCTTGGCTAGTAA-3\u2032. hybridization was detected with the probes 5\u2032-CCTGTTACATAAGCCAGGTGGAAT-3\u2032 (5\u2032-LC PCR analysis was performed in a lightCycler instrument. mRNA copy number was calculated based on a calibration line obtained by 10-fold stepwise dilution of plasmid DNA. Knockdown of human TMPRSS2 or HAT was estimated by real-time PCR. the mRNA9 of HCoV-NL63 was amplified using the oligonucleotide pair 5\u2032-TTAGACTTTGTGTCTACTC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-TACGCCAACGCTCTTGAAC-3\u2032 (5\u2032-LCRed640 labeled) the mRNA9 of HCoV-NL63 was amplified using the oligonucleotide pair 5\u2032-TTAGACTTTGTGTCTACTC-3\u2032 and 5 infectivity was quantified by real-time PCR to measure viral mRNA9 of these viruses. Error bars indicate the SD of the means from six independent samples. the cells were transiently transfected with siRNAs targeting TMPRSS2 (TM2-target) or HAT (HAT-target) mRNA levels for a housekeeping gene (GAPDH) and for the virus receptor (ACE2) were measured to evaluate the nontoxicity of camostat and EST in the samples at 6 days postinfection. infectivity was quantified by real-time PCR measurement of the amount of viral mRNA9. RESULTS Cell entry of pseudotyped viruses in the presence of exogenous trypsin or TMPRSS2. a high concentration of trypsin (1 mg/ml) inactivated pseudotyped virus bearing NL63-S, it activated SARS-S-bearing virus. TMPRSS2 or ACE2-TMPRSS2 cells were infected with pseudotyped viruses. udotyped virus entry increased 5-fold in the presence of TMPRSS2. pseudotyped NL63-S entry increased by 2.5-fold in the presence of TMPRSS2. cell entry by authentic SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63 also tested. the specific inhibitory effects of chemicals on TMPRSS2 were examined by observing their ability to suppress cell entry by pseudotyped virus. only camostat blocked the entry of pseudotyped SARS-S and NL63-S into TMPRSS2-expressing cells since TLCK inhibited pseudotyped SARS-S and NL63-S. amidine (Benz), 10 M aprotinin (Apro), 10 M gabexate (Gabex), 10 M camostat (Camo) or 50 M TLCK. infectivity was quantified by counting GFP-positive cells 20 h after viral inoculation. plasmid encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was transfected with plasmid encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) after 20 h, the cells were fixed with 4% formalin and stained with DAPI. syncytia in absence or presence of 0.1, 1, 10, or 100 M camostat were quantified by counting the number of nuclei in the fused cells. SS2-negative cells (white bars) by pseudotyped SARS-S were inhibited about 80% by LIII. infection by pseudotyped NL63 was only inhibited by 15%. inhibition of NL63-S cell entry by bafilomycin A1, EST, and MDL was similar to that of SARS-S cell entry by the same compounds. SS2-expressing cells with pseudotyped SARS-S were inhibited by 30 to 40% in the presence of cathepsin inhibitors and bafilomycin A1. this was not observed for NL63-S infection, except in case of cathepsin L inhibitor III, which inhibited infection by about 15%. however, 100% of NL63-S viruses utilize TMPRSS2 rather than cathepsins. heLa-ACE2 and HeLa-ACE2-TMPRSS2 cells were infected with pseudotyped viruses bearing SARS-S, NL63-S, or VSV-G. infectivity was quantified by counting GFP-positive cells 20 h after viral inoculation. error bars indicate the SD of the means from four independent wells. cells were counted for untreated cells, and error bars indicate the SD of the means from four independent wells. the following experiments were performed in artificially constructed cells expressing TMPRSS2. however, Calu-3 cells are not susceptible to VSV pseudotypes because the innate immunity of the cells is thought to suppress the early stages of viral infection. nontargeting siRNA nonspecifically reduced ACE2, TMPRSS2 and HAT mRNA levels. the decrease in TMPRSS2 mRNA obtained with a HAT-specific siRNA was not evaluated because the amount of remaining transcript was too low to be detectable. treatment of the cells with HAT-specific siRNA had no effect on SARS-CoV entry. simultaneous treatment with EST inhibitors (i.e., camostat and EST) was also measured. a nonenzymatic cell dissociation solution (C5914; Sigma) was used for passaging cells. exogenous trypsin may lead to an overestimation of the level of human coronavirus infection. Pseudotyped virus entry increased 5-fold in the presence of TMPRSS2. pseudotyped NL63-S entry increased by 2.5-fold. VSV infection was not affected by TMPRSS2. the specific inhibitory effects of chemicals on TMPRSS2 were examined by observing their ability to suppress cell entry by pseudotyped virus. only camostat blocked the entry of pseudotyped SARS-S and NL63-S into TMPRSS2-expressing cells. cells were infected with pseudotype viruses bearing SARS-S, NL63-S or VSV-G. infected cells were infected with 10 M benzamidine (Benz), 10 M aprotinin (Apro), 10 M gabexate (Gabex), 10 M camostat (Camo) syncytium formation was moderately inhibited by camostat at concentrations of 0.1 M and 1 M. the results indicated that camostat prevents the activation of S protein at the cell surface. infection of TMPRSS2-negative cells by pseudotyped SARS-S was inhibited about 80% by LIII. infection by pseudotyped NL63 was only inhibited by 15%. inhibition of NL63-S cell entry by bafilomycin A1, EST, and MDL was similar to that of SARS-S cell entry by the same compounds. infection of TMPRSS2-expressing cells with pseudotyped SARS-S was inhibited by 30 to 40% in the presence of cathepsin inhibitors and bafilomycin A1. this was not observed for NL63-S infection, except in the case of cathepsin L inhibitor III, which inhibited infection by about 15%. HeLa-ACE2 and HeLa-ACE2-TMPRSS2 cells were infected with pseudotyped viruses bearing SARS-S, NL63-S or VSV-G in the presence of 10 M EST, 10 M camostat (Cam), 100 nM bafilomycin (Baf), both EST and Cam. the results are presented as a percentage of infection. the results are presented as a percentage of infection. error bars indicate the SD of the means from four independent wells. the following experiments were performed in artificially constructed cells expressing TMPRSS2. however, the innate immunity of the cells is thought to suppress the early stages of viral infection. the suppression of target mRNAs was analyzed by real-time PCR. a nontargeting siRNA served as the negative control. however, nontargeting siRNA nonspecifically reduced ACE2, TMPRSS2 and HAT mRNA levels. the decrease in TMPRSS2 mRNA obtained with a HAT-specific siRNA was not evaluated. simultaneous treatment with siRNA and 10 M EST blocked infection by 10-fold. effect on Calu-3 cells of simultaneous treatment with the inhibitors was also measured. simultaneous treatment with serine and cysteine protease inhibitors effectively blocked SARS-CoV infection in a human airway epithelial cell line. DISCUSSION The interaction of SARS-CoV with host proteases is receptor mediated since the protease cleavage site of S protein is exposed only after receptor binding (17, 19, 30) TMPRSS2 enhances cell entry of both SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63. NL63 appears to favor TMPRSS2 rather than cathepsin. in TMPRSS2-expressing cells, pseudotyped NL63-S entry was not inhibited by cathepsin inhibitors. cleavage of SARS or NL63-S protein by TMPRSS2 would be difficult to detect by Western blot analysis. we previously reported that a considerable amount of cleavage of SARS-CoV S protein was not detected. we hypothesized that only a small amount of S protein needs to be cleaved to enable viral or cell-cell membrane fusion by TMPRSS2. camostat treatment caused a 5-fold decrease in SARS-CoV entry into Calu-3 cells. viral entry was not blocked by EST. it is unclear whether endosomal cathepsins or cell surface proteases are mainly used during viral entry."}
