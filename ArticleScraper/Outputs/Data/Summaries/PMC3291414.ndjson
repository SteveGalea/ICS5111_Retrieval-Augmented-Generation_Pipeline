{"summary": "transmission of influenza viruses is based on older experimental studies, inference from observations during outbreaks, and studies with other objectives. the \"infectiousness\" of patients is virtually always inferred on the basis of viral shedding from the upper respiratory tract rather than from directly observed transmission. the relationship between preexisting influenza antibody status of study participants is not reported. in 1 report, at least 4 illnesses (8% of the total) in children were associated with presymptomatic shedding. median duration of virus detection is typically 7\u20138 days after illness onset. shedding for up to 21 days has been recorded. large-droplet and aerosol Respiratory Transmission Animal studies and most influenza outbreaks among humans suggest that virus-laden large droplets (particles >5 mm in diameter) generated when infected persons cough or sneeze are the predominant mechanism of influenza virus transmission (8). experimental studies suggest that the infectious dose for humans exposed by aerosol is lower than that seen with experimental instillation (10). virus concentration fell by 100- to 1,000-fold within 5 min after transfer. titers can be found in nasal secretions at an early stage of illness. incubation period for influenza averages 2 days (range 1\u20134 days) and serial interval 2\u20134 days. titers peak during the first 24\u201372 h of illness and decline within several days, with titers usually low or undetectable by day 5. peak shedding in children occurs during the first 1\u20133 days of illness, but absolute levels may be higher than those in adults. influenza-like illnesses developed in 3 persons within 24 to 48 h. a person considered to be the probable index patient had felt unwell during work. an influenzalike illness began to develop 6 h after he finished work. virus on nonporous surfaces could be transferred to hands 24 h after the surface was contaminated. tissues could transfer virus to hands for 15 min after the tissue was contaminated. virus concentration fell by 100- to 1,000-fold within 5 min after transfer. some island countries enacted maritime quarantines that appear to have delayed or prevented the introduction of pandemic influenza. authorities could require ships to anchor in harbors or at quarantine stations on offshore islands, thus minimizing contact with persons on shore. the first cases of pandemic influenza in australia were reported in January 1919. ships with ill passengers arrived regularly at Sydney from October 1918 to January 1919. of 326 passengers or crew treated at the quarantine hospital, 49 died. two cases were in nurses who had contracted influenza while caring for patients at the quarantine hospital. quarantine of a ship in Accra, Ghana, known in advance to be carrying persons with influenza was not successful. in 1918, closing roads at the northern land border of Ghana was not feasible. substantial measures, including police checkpoints and interruption of road and rail traffic, did not prevent or appear to delay spread of infection between Canadian provinces or Australian states. at least 31 million health alert notices were distributed to entering international travelers in several countries, but follow-up information is limited. the 5 persons with SARS who entered Canada did not have signs or symptoms at international airports. the possible effect of entry screening for pandemic influenza has been estimated for the united kingdom. 1 case detected among 1.8 million departing passengers completing health questionnaires. no cases among 7 million persons who underwent thermal scanning on departure. measures to limit Influenza Virus Transmission on Conveyances Influenza has been transmitted on airplanes. influenza outbreaks have been reported on cruise ships during international voyages. a large summertime outbreak involved both international travelers and crew during 3 cruises of 1 ship. control measures included surveillance, isolation of ill crew, immunization of the crew, and use of antiviral drugs for treatment and prophylaxis of crew and passengers. 79 \"infected vessels\" containing 2,795 patients, 48,072 passengers, 10,456 crew and 149 \"uninfected vessels\" from October 1918 through may 1919, a total of 79 \"infected vessels\" containing 2,795 patients, 48,072 passengers, and 10,456 crew arrived at Australian ports. the first cases of pandemic influenza in australia were reported in January 1919. outbreaks in eastern and southern africa reported beginning in September to December 1918. contact between Madagascar and south africa was limited to a single coastal steamboat (20,21) in the Pacific, American Samoa implemented quarantine measures and was spared infection. nearby islands were severely affected (22) quarantines appear to have delayed or prevented the introduction of pandemic influenza. some islands enacted maritime quarantines that appear to have delayed or prevented the introduction of pandemic influenza. authorities could require ships to anchor in harbors or at quarantine stations on offshore islands. ships with ill passengers arrived regularly at Sydney from October 1918 to January 1919. of 326 passengers or crew treated at the quarantine hospital, 49 died. two cases were in nurses who had contracted influenza while caring for patients at the quarantine hospital. quarantine of a ship in Accra, Ghana, known in advance to be carrying persons with influenza was not successful. in 1918, closing roads at the northern land border of Ghana was not feasible. substantial measures, including police checkpoints and interruption of road and rail traffic, did not prevent or appear to delay spread of infection between Canadian provinces or Australian states. entry screening of air-travel Passengers during 2003 SARS Outbreak. data from 4 Asian locations and canada indicated body temperature-sensing devices did not detect anyone with SARS among >35 million entering travelers screened. at least 31 million health alert notices were distributed to entering international travelers in several countries. 813 incoming air-travel passengers from affected areas were quarantined. none of these 21 cases had been detected by entry screening (26,29) no additional spread of SARS through air travel was documented from countries with exit screening. influenza outbreaks have been reported on cruise ships during international voyages. a large summertime outbreak involved both international travelers and crew during 3 cruises of 1 ship. control measures included surveillance, isolation of ill crew, immunization of crew, and use of antiviral drugs for treatment and prophylaxis of crew and passengers. 9% of people infected by influenza who were asymptomatic on departure would be estimated to develop influenza symptoms en route to the united kingdom. symptoms would develop in an estimated mean of 17% (range 12%\u201323%) of infected persons traveling from Asian cities. entry screening would fail to detect 83% of infected persons (28). on a 75-seat aircraft, 15 passengers traveling with an influenza-infected person became ill. the most extensive investigation included 3 flights on which an index passenger had SARS. on 1 of these flights, 22 (18.3%) of 120 other passengers and crew became infected. the spread of pandemic influenza depends on transmission characteristics of the virus. if a substantial proportion of transmission occurs during the incubation period or during asymptomatic infection, the population impact of health screening and case-patient isolation will be diminished. monitoring over time is also needed to assess possible changes as the virus becomes more adapted to humans. fewer people would need to be screened, the positive predictive value for ill persons detected would be higher, and transmission on conveyances, such as aircraft, would be reduced. exit screening is disruptive and costly, but will not be fully efficient as influenza viruses can be carried by asymptomatic persons who will escape detection during screening."}
