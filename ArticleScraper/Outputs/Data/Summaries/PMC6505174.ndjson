{"summary": "the founders of the CC include five classical strains, A/J (AJ), C57BL/6J (B6), 129S1/SvImJ (129S1), NOD/ShiLtJ (NOD), NZO/HlLtJ (NZO), and three wild-derived strains, CAST/EiJ (CAST), PWK/PhJ (PWK), and WSB/EiJ (WSB). mice were housed in standard 20 30-cm ventilated polysulfone cages with standard laboratory grade bed-O-Cob bedding. water and Purina Prolab RMH3000 were available ad libitum. all animal rearing and breeding was conducted in strict compliance with the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals. enarcic et al. 2012 performed this estimation for continuous phenotypes. we reimplemented the BayesDiallel Gibbs sampler as a generalized linear mixed model. let y i be the number of pups born to litter i, where y i is a positive integer (zeros are not observed) the linear predictor i is composed of the following: an intercept. a litter (parity) order effect, modeled as the combination of a fixed effect slope, r. a batch effect, batch h N ( 0, batch 2 ) and a linear predictor, d ( j, k ) T. m k parental sex + I j = k ( inbred + b j ) inbred penalty + I j = k ( v j k + S j k w j k. inbred models an overall effect, I A is an indicator and equal to 1 if A is true and 0 otherwise, S A is a sign variable equal to 1 2 if A is true and 1 2 otherwise. epistatic effects are modeled as strain-pair specific deviations. \"symmetric\" effects v j k N stz ( 0, v 2 ) representing the overall deviation from the rest of the model induced by the (unordered) strain combination j with k. the inbred penalty ( inbred, b) is comparable to dominance measures defined in, for example, Hayman (1954) the parental sex effects (m) are akin to the maternal effects of Topham (1966) and the \u201cextranuclear\u201d effects in the \u201cbio\u201d model of Cockerham and Weir (1977) and Zhu and Weir (1996) the VarP is a heritability-like measure that partitions the overall phenotypic variance of an idealized future diallel experiment into additive, parent-of-origin (parental sex), inbred (dominance), epistatic, and other random/fixed effects categories. the VarP uses the estimated effects themselves, both fixed (e.g., inbred ) and random (i.e., the best linear unbiased predictors, or BLUPs data Availability File S1 contains all breeding data used for the analysis in this study. the data and code used to analyze the data are available at https://github.com/mauriziopaul/litterDiallel, with a static version available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2580307. tested effects included a season effect (average weaned litter size in each month over every year), non-seasonal factors (average weaned litter size for all months across all years) and a litter order effect (average weaned litter size in each subsequent dam litter) the effect of parental strains on y i was modeled using an overdispersed zero-truncated Poisson (ZTP) regression. y i ZTPois denotes a Poisson distribution with an expected value E [ y i ] = i 1 e i. i is composed of the following: an intercept. a litter (parity) order effect, modeled as the combination of a fixed effect slope, r. and a random effect with an independent level for each litter order, i.e., order r N ( r, order 2. a batch effect, batch h N ( 0, batch 2 ). the a (\u201cadditive\u201d) class represents strain-specific dosage effects, with a 1,..., a 8 modeled as a j N stz ( 0, a 2. a positive value of m j implies that strain j increases litter size more when inherited through the maternal line. the difference between maternal and paternal is 2 m j. dam j = a j + m j sire j = a j m j. dam j = a j + m j sire j = a j m j. posterior samples of these quantities were obtained as a post-processing step. ameterization to indirectly estimate dam and sire effects was proposed by Comstock and Robinson (1948, 1952) priors were chosen to be minimally informative. for fixed effects we used an inverse gamma distribution with scale and shape both equal to 0.001. the VarP calculation involves ratios of sums-of-squares in similar fashion to R 2 but for an idealized diallel that is both complete and balanced. the VarP is reportable for both fixed and random effects and includes confidence intervals arising from posterior uncertainty in those effects\u2019 values. data Availability File S1 contains all breeding data used for the analysis in this study. data and code used to analyze the data are available at https://github.com/mauriziopaul/litterDiallel. for all 62 genetic inbred and hybrid crosses, we recorded the following information: mated pairs, wean dates, litter size at weaning, including total and sex-specific counts (File S1). this diallel cross was originally designed and maintained for the generation of F1 mice for several experimental projects. we measured litter size and report the mean number of weaned pups per litter for the 62 viable crosses in the diallel. a wide distribution of litter sizes was observed, from an average of 3.6 weaned pups for WSB WSB crosses to an average of 9.1 weaned pups for NOD PWK crosses. previous research suggests that the first litter can be significantly smaller than subsequent litters due to various biological factors. this effect was consistent in the diallel: we observed significant reduction in litter size in the first litter (P 0.0001) compared to the overall linear effect that parity has on reducing litter size. thick horizontal lines represent 95% and 50% highest posterior density intervals of effects. vertical break and dash give posterior median and mean, respectively. effects are shown as the log, or latent, scale effects on the mean litter size attributable to each strain or strainpair and inheritance group. inbred litters are on average slightly smaller than their heterozygous counterparts. the most prominent is a negative asymmetric epistatic effect for PWK NOD. the mother vs. the father strain increase litter sizes by 1.26 fold. the overall mean for sex bias was 0.4979. for the eight inbred founders, 129S1 is the only strain that departed significantly from expectation. correction for multiple testing shows no significant sex ratio bias of any inbred strain. a total of 4,448 litters were evaluated for this analysis. the shading within each box corresponds to the average number of weaned pups per litter in each cross, with averages ranging from 3.6 to 9.1 pups per litter. a modeled \u2018year.month\u2019 covariate significantly affected litter size. two founder strains, 129S1 and WSB, had significantly larger average litter sizes at the Hillsborough facility than at UNC GMB. a Bayesian regression model decomposes the phenotypic variation in the diallel into genetic and parent-of-origin contributions. the percentage of the variance in litter size explained by diallel effects was 17.73%, with additive effects explaining 9.18%, the fact of being inbred (VarP[inbred.overall]) accounting for 5.77%. labels with 'v' or 'w' refer to symmetric or asymmetric epistatic effects. general effects comprise strain-specific additive effects (additive), strain-specific and overall inbred (inbred) and strain-specific parent-of-origin (parental sex) effects. we reparameterized the BayesDiallel model to capture effects specific to dam.strain and sire.strain. the dam.strain has a much larger influence on the variation of litter size compared with the sire.strain. correction for multiple testing shows no significant sex ratio bias of any inbred strain. the outbred crosses have substantially fewer litters and offspring than the inbred matings. but when multiple testing is accounted for, they also show no significant deviations from expected sex ratios. a similar pattern is observed here, but these effects are determined to be specifically through the maternal strain. two of the wild-derived strains, CAST and PWK, are from a different subspecific origin than the other six CC founders. this likely contributes to decreased productivity through subspecific incompatibilities. we did observe a significant effect on litter size after the transfer of the mice to the UNC GMB facility. this may have been due to the use of Fenbendazole during the time of the transfer. other factors, such as the sex of the laboratory personnel interacting with the animals, are generally known to influence rodent behavior. meterized our strain-specific additive and parental-sex effects in the original BayesDiallel model. we collapsed the additive and parental-sex effects into \"dam.strain\" and \"sire.strain\" effects in a post-processing step. this allowed us to run the original model while also viewing our data from the perspective of dam strain and sire strain contributions. future multiparental research populations should test for strain incompatibilities, reproductive phenotyping, and other health traits in a full diallel before the recombinant inbreeding begins. this type of regression is explicit in its framework accounting for discrete observations, and allows for parameterization of excess variance observed. the vertical red lines indicate the mean values. for the ZTP, the first two moments (mean and variance) are given by: E [ y i ] = i 1 e i (5) V [ y i ] = i 1 e i (5) V [ y i ] = i 1 e i (5) V [ y i ] = i 1 e i (5) V [ y i ] = i 1 the vertical red lines correspond to the mean of the values shown in Figure 4. Diallel effect estimates are obtained using an MCMCglmm (Hadfield 2010) implementation of BayesDiallel (BayesDiallel-glmm, henceforth), with 1.515 10 6 iterations, 1.5 10 4 iterations of burn-in, and thinning by 500 (saving only every 1/500th iteration) the model is formulated for binomial GLMM regression. the proportion of weaned pups that are male, or equivalently, the proportion of weaned pups that are female, is approximated."}
