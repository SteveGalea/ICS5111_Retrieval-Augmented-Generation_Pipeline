{"summary": "infection with an upper respiratory tract virus, such as rhinovirus or parainfluenza virus, typically results in a self-limited illness in a normal host. this type of infection can result in significant morbidity and mortality in an immunocompromised host. the severity of illness in this population is typically attributed to the frequent development of secondary infection with bacteria, fungi, or other viruses. the filmArray respiratory panel is a multiplexed, fully automated PCR assay. it is capable of detecting 18 viral respiratory pathogens and three atypical bacterial pathogens with a turnaround time of approximately 1 h (12) the performance of this assay on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) samples in the immunocompromised host population has been described. both filmArray and verification PCR testing were performed retrospectively such that the results had no impact on clinical decision making. electronic medical records were reviewed for clinical details of patients who contributed respiratory samples. the filmArray RP system reported a cycle threshold for each positive PCR assay. the research use only version of the filmArray RP system reported a cycle threshold for each positive PCR assay. three separate sample preparation methods were used for verification testing. twenty-four samples underwent verification testing using the standard RNA preparation for multiple pathogens. the assays used a chemistry (real-time, singleplex PCR with hydrolysis probes) and targeted sequences for each organism, their primer and probe sequences, and the limit of detection 95 (LoD95) verification testing was performed on coded samples without knowledge of the clinical testing or the filmArray RP assay results. patients were considered not to be infected if clinical testing and filmArray RP testing both yielded negative results. if no verification testing was available for a particular pathogen, discordant results could not be resolved. clinical testing and the filmArray RP assay were compared using the exact two-sided McNemar's test. the cPPV and cNPV (as defined above) were calculated separately for clinical testing and the filmArray RP assay. electronic medical records were reviewed for clinical details of patients who contributed respiratory samples, including gender, age, underlying malignancy, type of transplant, and the reason for the respiratory virus testing. all study BAL and NPA samples were tested for one or more respiratory viruses based on clinical indications determined by the patient's clinical providers. the filmArray instrument and pouch system have been described in detail elsewhere (11\u201313) the research use only version of the filmArray RP system reported a cycle threshold for each positive PCR assay. study samples for which clinical respiratory virus testing and filmArray RP assay results were discordant. six samples underwent verification testing using the standard RNA preparation for RSV. the assays used a chemistry (real-time, singleplex PCR with hydrolysis probes) the targets for each organism, their primer and probe sequences, and the limit of detection 95 (LoD95) patients were considered not to be infected if clinical testing and filmArray RP testing both yielded negative results. if verification testing was concordant with the positive clinical test result or the filmArray RP result, then the patient was considered not to be infected with the respiratory virus. the cPPV and cNPV were calculated separately for clinical testing and filmArray RP testing. RESULTS Ninety samples were obtained from 87 immunocompromised patients undergoing respiratory viral testing for clinical indications. clinical indicationsa Sample characteristic No. (%) of samples Type of sample NPA 34 (38) BAL 56 (62) Clinical indication for test URI 28 (31) LRI 42 (47) Surveillance 20 (22) a Samples obtained from 87 patients. the filmArray RP assay was significantly more likely to detect a respiratory virus than routine clinical testing at DFCI/BWH. results for routine testing at DFCI/BWH for all samples (n = 90) results for filmArray RP assay for NPA samples (n = 34) results from clinically indicated testing,a FilmArray RP testing, and verification testing for samples where a respiratory viral disease was considered present. results from clinically indicated testing,a FilmArray RP testing, and verification testing for samples where respiratory viral disease was not confirmed No. of samplesb Clinical result FilmArray RP result Verification result 58 Negative \u2014c 1 PIV2 Negative \u2014d 1 PIV3 Negative \u2014d 2 Negative Rhinovirus/enterovirus Negative 1 Negative HMPV; rhinovirus/enterovirus Negative 1 Negative Bocavirus Negative a Including samples collected for clinical symptoms the filmArray RP assay still identified a viral pathogen significantly more often than clinical testing (McNemar P = 0.002) results between the filmArray RP and DFCI/BWH clinical testing were discordant. 33 samples (37%) underwent verification testing. the median cycle threshold for the viruses detected by FilmArray RP in these four samples was higher than the median cycle threshold for the other 27 viruses detected by filmArray RP assay. two samples tested positive by clinical testing for parainfluenza virus 2 and parainfluenza virus 3 but tested positive for rhinovirus/enterovirus by filmArray RP assay and verification testing. cPPV and cNPV of the FilmArray RP assay and clinical testing overall did not change much when only the first samples obtained from each patient in the cohort were considered. the low cPPV of the filmArray RP assay can be attributed to the four samples described above that tested positive by the FilmArray RP assay. parainfluenza virus 2 and parainfluenza virus 3 were detected by clinical testing but not by filmArray RP assay. the majority of additional pathogens identified by the filmArray RP assay included those not available by routine testing at DFCI/BWH (rhinovirus/enterovirus, coronavirus, and bocavirus) the overall number of BAL samples with any respiratory viruses detected was relatively low (9/56 [16%]) the cNPVs of the filmArray RP panel on BAL samples were higher than those of routinely available clinical testing at DFCI/BWH. in contrast, all NPA samples in the present study except one were collected from a symptomatic immunocompromised host. the median cycle threshold for these viruses in the filmArray RP assay was much higher than that for viruses detected by the filmArray RP assay in other samples and confirmed by validation testing. this difference in median cycle threshold suggests that there may have been very small amounts of virus present in these samples, leading to false-negative validation testing. this issue also highlights the difficulty of studying the performance of novel respiratory virus diagnostics where there is no diagnostic gold standard test for many viral pathogens."}
