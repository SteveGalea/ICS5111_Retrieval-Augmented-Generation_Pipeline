{"summary": "there is little known and very little, if any, published on this topic. the IHR (2005) core capacity requirements have been poorly implemented in most countries, particularly in those that are resource-poor and vulnerable. there is now a demonstrated need to embed the IHR (2005) core capacities into health systems. recent global health crises, including H1N1 influenza (2009), Ebola (2014) and Zika (2016) have resulted in pointed criticisms of the international health community\u2019s ability to deal with such threats. but crises also offer opportunities for learning and improvement. the IHR (2005) represent a binding instrument on the 196 \u2018States Parties\u2019. they rest responsibility for acquiring the core capacity for surveillance and response required under the IHR (2005). a concerted effort is underway to ensure that the IHR requirements are an integral part of essential public health operations. the existing IHR (1969), which was a framework for reporting only three infectious diseases: cholera, plague and yellow fever (smallpox was removed in 1981 following its official eradication in 1980) the revised IHR (2005) came into force in 2007. the review highlighted a number of positives but concluded more was required for the world to respond adequately to sustained public health emergencies. the IHR (2005) also require some core capacity for designated airports, ports and ground crossings. there are further expectations around countries\u2019 capacity for coordination (multisectoral action, eg, between health, transport, food, agriculture, the environment, etc) joint external evaluation (JEE), simulation exercises and after-action reviews help assess gaps to develop a national action plan to strengthen country IHR capacity. much of the data and feedback can also be related to how well the health system itself is functioning. a stronger legal basis to overcome the lack of a formal enforcement mechanism could help to address some of the implementation gaps and failings already identified. a stronger legal basis to overcome the lack of a formal enforcement mechanism and to ensure coordinated and rapid action through the health system could help address some of the implementation gaps and failings already identified. strong health systems, resilient to health crises, and with robust emergency policies are central to UHC. research has highlighted that a resilient health system is indeed one that is moving towards UHC. 23 24 WHO can help ensure that countries work towards meeting the Sustainable Development Goals in line with global emergency preparedness activities. a recent review of leading health system frameworks found that surveillance capacity was in general insufficiently integrated, and in some cases even non-existent as a dedicated function. surveillance was in turn indicator-based, highlighting the need for more event-based surveillance for quicker risk and event detection as called for under the IHR (2005). national health information systems need to be able to \u2018speak to\u2019 and have interoperability with other sectors in terms of data exchange. this includes being able to capture local specificities and connect with affected communities and actors. the ability to quickly activate other health system building blocks are priorities both during emergencies and for securing the health system itself. for emergency preparedness and response, there is a raft of profiles required from the health workforce. for IHR (2005) purposes, there is a raft of profiles required from the health workforce. there is a raft of profiles required from the health workforce. a stronger legal basis to overcome the lack of a formal enforcement mechanism could help to address some of the implementation gaps and failings already identified. the US framework was borne of the need to serve a federal structure, but there is a need for something similar in countries in order to mandate obligatory multisectoral responses. strong health systems, resilient to health crises, and with robust emergency policies are central to UHC. research has highlighted that a resilient health

raft of profiles required from the health workforce. this includes epidemiologists, clinicians, public health specialists, laboratory personnel, health information experts and biostatisticians, risk communication professionals, sociologists and anthropologists, as well as doctors, nurses and veterinarians. the importance of financing cannot be understated. implementation of the IHR (2005) is often done in a vertical manner, outside the health system strengthening effort at national level. the situation traditionally reflects a similar issue within WHO. there are key interlays with public health functions that need to be developed. such a group would minimise silos and will introduce the IHR (2005) at all levels of WHO. the paper has made an initial case for better embedding the IHR (2005) into health systems. the need for a global strategy for local investment in core capacity to detect, report and respond rapidly to outbreaks is the first recommendation of the Harvard-LSHTM Independent Panel on the global response to Ebola. governments need to see the IHR as \u2018theirs\u2019 and as part of the national health system, such that investment can be sustained."}
