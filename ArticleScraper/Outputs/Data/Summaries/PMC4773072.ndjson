{"summary": "the novel coronaviruses responsible for both SARS and MERS infections are zoonotic viruses. both viruses spread to an intermediate mammalian host from which humans are infected. previous studies also indicated that HCP were a major high-risk population for infections with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. a laboratory-confirmed case with MERS-CoV was defined as either detection of viral nucleic acid or confirmation by serology. a laboratory-confirmed case with MERS-CoV was defined as either detection of viral nucleic acid or confirmation by serology. all laboratory-confirmed MERS cases were obtained from various publicly available sources from April 1 of 2012 to July 7 of 2015. all laboratory-confirmed SARS cases were reported to the WHO from Taiwan during November 1 of 2002 to December 31, 2003. case definitions were confirmed by several different laboratory tests. we used the ggplot function from the R package \u201cggplot2\u201d to draw the boxplots of age distribution between MERS and SARS cases. quantitative measurements are presented as the mean and range of the observed values. quantitative measurements are presented as the mean and range of the observed values, and qualitative measurements are presented as relative and absolute frequencies. der Yes Yes NA NA Cluster size NA 2.3 (126) NA NA 8 (0125) NA NA Outbreak areas Hospitals (Hosp) Hosp, Households (HH) NA Hospitals Hosp, HH, Communities NA NA NA Animal Sources No Bat and camel No NA Human Cases Percent of HCP cases NA 13.37% (183/1368) NA 21.07% (1706/8096) NA 0.000 NA Mean age (yr) 40 (2474) 49 (290) 0.035 35 (2 the denominator is the cumulative number of total cases with MERS-CoV; Pie represents the percentage of HCP and non HCP among the total cases. as of 31 December 2003, 8096 laboratory-confirmed global human SARS-CoV cases had been reported to the WHO. the denominator is the cumulative number of total cases with SARS-CoV; Pie represents the percentage of HCP and non HCP among the total cases. the mean age in worldwide total 174 MERS cases was 49 years (range: 290 years), of which 143 MERS-HCP cases were aged 40 years (range: 2474 years), significantly younger than in 31 MERS-non-HCP cases. 101 MERS-HCP and 69.55% of 1258 MERS-non-HCP were male respectively. males accounted for 46.93% (3778/8050) of total global SARS cases. 58.82% (10/17) of MERS-HCP cases worked in an intensive care unit. the occupational categories of hospital-associated MERS infections (n = 169) in Korea, 2015 and SARS infections (n = 227) in Taiwan, 2003. the percentage of severe MERS cases in HCP was significantly lower than those in non-HCP. clinical comparisons of laboratory-confirmed human infections with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV between healthcare personnel (HCP) and non-HCP. comparisons of the laboratory-confirmed human infections with MERS-CoV. 0.001 0.001 Sore throat 17.07% (22/128) 14.00% (13/92) 0.541 3.06% (3/98) 3.21% (8/249) 0.942 0.001 0.001 Runny nose 9.76% (12/128) 0.00% (0/92) 0.006 1.02% (1/98) 1.20% (3/249) 0.884 0.007 0.686 Haemoptysis 0.00% (0/128) 17.00% (16/92) hea 4.88% (6/128) 5.43% (5/92) 0.082 0.00% (0/98) 0.00% (0/249) NA: No available data *SARS-CoV Data were obtained from Taiwan. p2: comparison of HCP and Non-HCP cases infected with MERS-CoV. time periods for clinical progress Three time periods useful for public health surveillance were evaluated. in MERS groups, incubation period showed no differences between MERS-HCP and MERS-non-HCP [7 (311) vs 5 (2.015), p = 0.150] or between SARS-HCP and SARS-non-HCP cases. 10 fatal MERS-HCP cases from Saudi Arabia, UAE and Jordan, as well as 13 fatal SARS-HCP cases in Taiwan were included. the mean age of fatal MERS-HCP cases was 50 (2667), 70% of them were male, and 40% (4/10) had comorbidities.
