{"summary": "KD is also called mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome, because it involves lymph nodes, skin, and mucous membranes inside the mouth, nose, and throat. in the united states, about 5500 cases of KD were estimated in 2009. no laboratory test can accurately diagnose KD and atypical cases that are approximate KD but do not meet all diagnostic criteria for KD. the real number of undertreated and misdiagnosed cases is unknown. the prevalence of CAA is reduced to as few as 1% and no more than 5% of cases. several microbial agents have been studied in connection with KD. additional possible causes include prior respiratory disease. nic blacks, non-Hispanic whites, and hispanics are 17.5, 12, and 15.7 cases per 100,000 hospitalizations. no laboratory test can accurately diagnose KD and atypical cases that are approximate KD but do not meet all diagnostic criteria for KD. the prevalence of CAA is reduced to as few as 1% and no more than 5% of cases. treatment within 10 days after onset of fever is essential to decrease risk of heart problems. untreated recurrences can lead to aneurism of the coronary arteries, myocarditis,25 toxic shock, and sudden death. Continuing medical education has become increasingly important to the management of KD because of the serious and sometimes fatal consequences of delayed treatment caused by erroneous diagnoses. effective management of KD would substantially benefit public health. it is imperative to educate physicians and other clinicians to recognize the signs and symptoms of KD. delay or erroneous diagnoses delay treatment and sometimes lead to death."}
