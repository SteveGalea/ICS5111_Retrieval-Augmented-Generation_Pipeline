{"summary": "the root cause of the problem stems from our reliance on culture-based diagnostic tests that are neither sensitive nor fast enough to guide precise and timely treatment. the root cause of the problem stems from our reliance on culture-based diagnostic tests that are neither sensitive nor fast enough to guide precise and timely treatment. the ability to efficiently and precisely target antibiotics is an unmet critical need in the care of severe pneumonia in the ICU. this has fueled my interest in leveraging the lung microbiome study tools for this purpose. 16S sequencing has given us first-time surveys of the composition of the diagnostic \u201cblack box\u201d that culture-negative cases represent. in our cohort, about 20% of communities are dominated by common pathogens (yet missed by cultures), and the remaining majority show high abundance of bacteria with probable oral origin. metagenomics/transcriptomics can expand our knowledge of pathogenic organisms (16), characterize poorly defined clinical syndromes (17, 18) and help identify emerging disease entities (19) across the spectrum of human pathology. shotgun approaches have yet to be optimized for application in respiratory samples with overwhelming amounts of human DNA compared to microbial DNA that compromise signal and analyses (11). metagenomics is a far more sensitive technology, but conventional sensitivity/specificity analyses contrasting metagenomics with cultures are meaningless. the main prerequisite is knowledge of the true pathogen(s) in pneumonia, which can be unavailable in up to 60% of cases despite systematic workup (3). observational studies of culture-confirmed cases can help develop statistical models and/or train machine-learning algorithms for sequencing-based definitions of pneumonia (pneumonia index) in culture-negative cases, the true pathogen (if any) is unknown, and diagnosis is syndromic based on clinical constellations. metagenomics-based diagnostic tests have to be compared against standard-of-care microbiologic cultures in randomized clinical trials. the main prerequisite is knowledge of the true pathogen(s) in pneumonia. culture-positive cases also offer the opportunity to refine predictive algorithms of antibiotic resistance gene detection versus clinical antibiograms. metagenomic profiles can be translated into probabilities of pneumonia diagnosis. the output has to be simple and binary in order to be clinically usable. the idea of \u201cgenetic exceptionalism\u201d did not prove to be conducive for clinical translation of genomics. ongoing technological and bioinformatic innovations will bring to the bedside the next-generation diagnostic tools for timely, targeted and precise antibiotic use in the ICU."}
