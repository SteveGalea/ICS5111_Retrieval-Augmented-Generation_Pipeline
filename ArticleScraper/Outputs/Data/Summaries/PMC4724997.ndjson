{"summary": "we have developed molecular clones for several highly pathogenic swine and human coronaviruses. the highly virulent PC22A strain was sequenced and synthesized as six contiguous PEDV subclones designated A to F. subclones A/B, B/C, C/D, and D/E are joined by unique SapI restriction endonuclease cleavage sites. PEDV genome, including ORF1a, ORF1b, and the spike (S), ORF3, envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) genes. restriction sites were used to replace ORF3 with tomato-red and the ORF3 transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) capped PEDV-N gene transcripts were mixed with full-length genomic transcripts prior to electroporation into vero cells. within 24 to 48 h postelectroporation, subgenomic recombinant-virus mRNA could be detected via reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) wild-type and recombinant viruses replicated to titers that approached or exceeded 1 104 PFU/ml in vero cells. recombinant viruses cloned and expressed PEDV-S and PEDV-N in equine encephalitis virus strain 3526 virus replicon particles. the VRP were inoculated into the footpads of mice, and polyclonal PEDV-N and PEDV-S antisera were collected after a day 21 boost. recombinant viruses have protein expression phenotypes similar to those of the parental virus. the transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) in the leader region of PEDV subgenomic transcripts is conserved between the wild type and icPEDV. to further confirm the presence of the recombinant virus postelectroporation, we reverse transcribed genomic RNA from virions in the culture media and then sequenced them to demonstrate the presence of the distinguishing BsaI cloning site in infectious-clone viruses. all three viruses replicated to similar peak titers (11 to 13 log10 genomic equivalents [GE]/ml) PC22A and icPEDV group pigs had more-severe diarrhea (highest fecal score of 3) than icPEDV-ORF3-RFP group pigs (highest score of 2). days of harvest varied between virus types and within virus groups. icPEDV mimics wild-type PEDV infection in gnotobiotic piglets. piglets were infected orally with 2 ml of the PEDV supernatant. an uninoculated piglet was cohoused with them to determine transmission. RT-qPCR titers showed severe villous atrophy in PEDV PC22A- and icPEDV-inoculated pigs and moderate-to-severe villous atrophy in icPEDV-ORF3-RFP-infected pigs. the villous height/crypt depth ratio of the jejunum of a mock-inoculated pig was significantly higher than those of PC22A-, icPEDV-, and all images show representative histological slides of jejunum specimens from mock-infected or infected animals. icPEDV- or icPEDV-ORF3-RFP-infected animals showed H&E staining and immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining for PEDV nucleocapsid protein using mouse anti-PEDV-N. icPEDV-ORF3-RFP replicated the clinical phenotypes of parental PC22A in vivo. icPEDV-ORF3-RFP infection resulted in partial attenuation in pigs based on lower diarrhea scores. rapid infection of contact pigs suggests efficient transmission of icPEDV and icPEDV. PEDV fragments were digested using restriction sites designated in Fig. 1. they were digested using a 1% agarose gel, excised, and purified using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen) the fragments were mixed and ligated overnight at 4\u00b0C using T4 DNA ligase (Roche) sk in growth medium at 37\u00b0C for 2 h. trypsin was added to the culture at 5 g/ml 12 h postelectroporation. cDNA from viral RNA transcripts was generated using superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies) blots were denatured in 4 Laemmli buffer (Bio-Rad) at 95\u00b0C for 6 min and then separated on gradient 4 to 15% mini-protean precast gels (Bio-Rad) to detect PEDV antigens, blots were first blocked with 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (TBST) and then probed with a polyclonal mouse serum (diluted 1:200) a stainless steel divider contained small holes which allowed only indirect contact between the groups. pigs were monitored daily for clinical signs of disease, including diarrhea and vomiting. antigen retrieval and unmasking were performed by treatment with 0.05% pronase E (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 20 min. sections were incubated in power block solution (BioGenex) for 30 min at room temperature."}
