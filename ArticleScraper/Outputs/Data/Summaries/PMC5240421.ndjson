{"summary": "Background Tuberculosis (TB) caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis is one of the leading causes of death from infectious diseases worldwide. Sputum smear microscopy remains the most widely available pulmonary TB diagnostic tool particularly in resource limited settings. a highly sensitive diagnostic with minimal infrastructure, cost and training is required. specificity of LAMP and smear microscopy in series was high. sensitivity of LAMP was insufficient for smear negative sputum samples."}
