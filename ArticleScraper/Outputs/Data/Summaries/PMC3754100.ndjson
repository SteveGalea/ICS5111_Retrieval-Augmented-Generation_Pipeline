{"summary": "influenza virus is characterized by a high mutation rate and the ability to reassort its genome segments with other viruses (3, 7) these two properties allow the virus to constantly evolve and sustain in its original host and to adapt to new hosts (5, 8) annual outbreaks in humans are currently caused by influenza A viruses of the H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes. despite a limited number of cases of human-to-human transmission, H5N1 influenza virus remains a pandemic threat. mutations altering pH at which the HA protein is activated for membrane fusion have been associated with altered virulence in mice and interspecies adaptation (35\u201340). an HA2-K58I mutation (K to I at position 58) decreases the HA activation pH of A/chicken/Vietnam/C58/2004 (H5N1) from 5.9 to 5.4 supports enhanced and prolonged replication in the murine upper respiratory tract. a decrease in the HA activation pH also coincided with enhanced replication of NS1 deletion mutant H5 and H3 influenza viruses in the URT of mice. a decrease in the activation pH of the HA protein was found to be necessary for airborne transmissibility of H5 viruses in mice and ferrets. the goal of the current study was to determine how a single acid-stabilizing HA protein mutation influences in vivo infection in mice and ferrets. this is important in conducting surveillance, performing risk assessment of currently circulating avianlike H5N1 influenza viruses. rg-VN1203-HA-WT and rg-VN1203-HA2-K58I viruses were generated by using reverse genetics (rg) as previously described. eight pHW2000 plasmids, each containing an individual gene of the eight influenza A virus genes, were transfected into cocultured MDCK and 293T cells. phosphate-buffered saline plus calcium and magnesium (PBS+) treated for 5 min with 500 l PBS+ that was adjusted to the desired pH using 0.1 M citric acid. cells were then neutralized with DMEM and incubated for another 2 h at 37\u00b0C. pH of conformational change was determined by using a monoclonal antibody. plates were washed 3 times with PBS before the addition of a biotinylated sialylglycopolymer containing either an (2,3) (Neu5Ac2,3Gal1,4GlcNAc1-pAP) or an (2,6) (Neu5Ac2,3Gal1,4GlcNAc1-pAP) sialic acid. the reaction was stopped with 50 l of 50 mM HCl. the acid stabilities of the viruses were measured by determining the susceptibility of each virus to acid inactivation. the titer of remaining infectious virus was determined in MDCK cells by using the 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) assay. cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated with 5 mg/ml fluorescein-TMR (tetramethylrhodamine)-tagged dextran (Invitrogen) for 20 min at 37\u00b0C. cells were imaged on a Nikon TE2000 E2 confocal scan head. mice were infected with 50 l or 5 l of PBS+ containing 1 MLD50. mice were then weighed and observed daily. mice showed severe weight loss or illness were euthanized for humane reasons. serum was collected from contact ferrets on day 20 postcontact. all work with highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza was performed in an enhanced animal biosafety level 3 laboratory. staff are required to shower upon exit and comply with a quarantine policy to prevent outside contact with birds or immunocompromised hosts. the ABSL3+ laboratory is inspected biannually by the USDA. it meets or exceeds all standards outlined in biosafety in microbiological and biomedical Laboratories (58). the laboratory manager controls access to the virus inventory. rg-VN1203-HA-WT and rg-VN1203-HA2-K58I viruses were generated by using reverse genetics (rg) as previously described. rg-VN1203-HA-WT and rg-VN1203-HA2-K58I viruses were generated by using reverse genetics (rg) as previously described. HA-expressing vero cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline plus calcium and magnesium (PBS+) and treated for 5 min with 500 l PBS+ that was adjusted to the desired pH using 0.1 M citric acid. the cells were then neutralized with DMEM and incubated for another 2 h at 37\u00b0C. the cells were then fixed and stained by using a Hema 3 stat pack staining kit. the amount of bound erythrocytes was determined by measuring the absorbance of clarified lysate at 415 nm by using a Synergy-2 multimode microplate reader (BioTek) plates were coated with 10 mg/ml fetuin (Sigma) overnight at 4\u00b0C and then washed with PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) at room temperature for 1 h. the acid stabilities of the viruses were measured by determining the susceptibility of each virus to acid inactivation. the titer of remaining infectious virus was determined in MDCK cells by using the 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) assay. cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated with 5 mg/ml fluorescein-TMR (tetramethylrhodamine)-tagged dextran (Invitrogen) for 20 min at 37\u00b0C. cells were imaged on a Nikon TE2000 E2 microscope equipped with a confocal scan head. female mice were infected with 50 l or 5 l of PBS+ containing 1 MLD50. mice were then weighed and observed daily. mice showed severe weight loss or illness were euthanized. serum samples were treated with receptor-destroying enzyme (Seiken) overnight at 37\u00b0C to destroy nonspecific receptors, heat inactivated at 56\u00b0C for 30 min. the HI assay was performed using VN1203 virus and 0.5% chicken red blood cells. all work with highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza was performed in an enhanced animal biosafety level 3 laboratory. the ABSL3+ laboratory is inspected biannually by the USDA. it meets or exceeds all standards outlined in biosafety in microbiological and biomedical Laboratories (58). the lab manager controls access to the virus inventory. HA2-K58I mutation was previously found to decrease by 0.5 pH units the HA activation pH of the related isolate A/chicken/Vietnam/C58/2004 (H5N1). both HA proteins had similar binding avidities to chicken and turkey red blood cells. rg-VN1203-WT and rg-VN1203-HA2-K58I were exposed to buffers ranging in pH. rg-VN1203-WT and rg-VN1203-HA2-K58I were exposed to buffers ranging in pH. titers of HA2-K58I virus were quantified using TCID50. the virus retained its infectivity upon exposure to buffers with pH values as low as 5.5. the virus lost 90% (1 log10) of its infectious titer at pH 5.5. the rg-VN1203-HA2-K58I virus had wild-type-like growth kinetics in MDCK and NHBE cells. rg-VN1203-HA2-K58I virus grew to significantly lower virus titers (P values of 0.01, two-way ANOVA) than the wild-type after 24 h of infection in A549 cells. a plot of the red/green ratio on the calibration curve revealed that MDCK cells had an endosomal pH of 5.4 and A549 cells had an endosomal pH of 5.9. this results are consistent with the HA2-K58I virus being attenuated in rg-VN1203 wild-type (WT) and mutant viruses. a higher fluorescence intensity of pHrodo correlates with a lower pH value. cells were incubated with fluorescein-TMR double-conjugated dextran to allow uptake of the dye into the endosomes and then were washed and imaged by using confocal microscopy. only 13% of mice infected with HA2-K58I virus survived infection. this difference was not statistically significant. only wild-type and HA2-K58I viral loads were detected in lungs. low viral loads of rg-VN1203-HA2-K58I in the murine nasal cavity were unexpected. the HA2-K58I mutation increased the viral load of the C58 isolate in the URT of mice (35). however, the C58 isolate is highly attenuated in mammals compared to the infectivity of VN1203 (52) the HA2-K58I virus was found to enhance VN1203 virus growth in the murine URT. the control group was inoculated with 5 l PBS only. the detection limit was 1 log10 EID50/ml. we inoculated groups of 5 ferrets intranasally with 0.5 ml of PBS containing 1,000 TCID50 of either rg-VN1203-WT or rg-VN1203-HA2-K58I. after 5 days of infection, three of the five directly inoculated ferrets were euthanized so that tissues could be recovered. on day 5, 3 of the 5 directly inoculated ferrets were euthanized to collect tissues. one ferret each from the WT and the HA2-K58I group died from illness. both wild-type and HA2-K58I virus-infected ferrets had similar viral loads in their nasal washes. by day 5 postinoculation, both groups had similar viral loads in their nasal tissues. the brains and large intestines from the wild-type and HA2-K58I virus-infected ferrets had comparable viral loads. the wild-type group, none of the four contact ferrets seroconverted. an HA2-K58I mutation decreases the HA activation pH without altering other properties. in ferrets, these two properties of VN1203 contribute to robust virus growth in the lungs. both HA proteins bound exclusively to sialic acid receptors and not to (2,6)-linked sialic acid receptors. the mutation did not result in substantial differences in HA protein expression, cleavage, or receptor binding. wild-type HA protein was activated for membrane fusion after buffer pulses of pH 6.0 or lower. the K58I mutant was not triggered for membrane fusion unless the pH pulse was reduced to pH 5.5 or lower. the average HA activation pH values for wild-type and K58I HA proteins were 5.95 and 5.45 respectively. in vitro growth of HA2-K58I virus is reduced in A549 cells due to a relatively high endosomal pH. rg-VN1203-HA2-K58I virus had wild-type-like growth kinetics in MDCK and NHBE cells. 2-K58I virus in a549 cells but not in MDCK cells. the fluorescence intensity of pHrodo increased as endosomal pH decreases. the mean fluorescence intensity of the pHrodo probe was 2-fold higher in MDCK cells than in A549 cells. rg-VN1203 WT or HA2-K58I virus titers were determined at the indicated time points in MDCK cells by using TCID50 assays. the detection limit was 1 log10 TCID50/ml. the HA2-K58I mutation does not alter the virulence of VN1203 in C57BL/6J mice. we inoculated mice with 50 l of PBS containing 150 EID50 of either rg-VN1203-WT or rg-VN1203-HA2-K58I. euthanized the mice after 4 days of infection to measure tissue titers. the control group was inoculated with 50 l PBS containing 1 MLD50 of the rg-VN1203 WT or HA2-K58I viruses. the detection limit was 1 log10 EID50/ml. a 5-l inoculation with either the WT or HA2-K58I virus resulted in little (10%) to no weight loss. a 5-l inoculation with either the WT or HA2-K58I virus resulted in little (10%) to no weight loss. the control (PBS) group was inoculated with 5 l PBS only. the detection limit was 1 log10 EID50/ml. ferrets directly inoculated with the HA2-K58I virus succumbed to infection within 7 days due to severe weight loss or were euthanized because of hind limb paralysis. two of the 5 directly inoculated ferrets and all contact ferrets (n = 4) were observed for (A) weight loss and (B) survival. the differences in the titers of HA2-K58I viruses in the left lower lung were statistically significant (P 0.01) the viral loads of the HA2-K58I virus in ferret nasal washes were 100- to 1,000-fold higher (P 0.01) than those of the wild-type virus on days 1 and 2 postinfection. no HA2-K58I virus was detected in the livers of inoculated ferrets. none of the four naive contact ferrets from either the wild-type or the HA2-K58I virus-infected group were observed to lose weight, die, have neurological symptoms, or shed virus. this human isolate from clade 1 has an avian preferred receptor binding specificity but a mammalian-adapted polymerase (i.e., PB2-E627K) (52) the results bear directly on the potential of a single, acid-stabilizing mutation to enhance the capability of a circulating H5N1 virus to grow, disseminate, and transmit in mammalian hosts. an HA2-K58I mutation in a/chicken/Vietnam/C58/2004 (H5N1) is attenuating in mallards (39) but enhancing in mice (35). a single acid-stabilizing mutation in the HA protein can switch the preference of a nonadapted/nonreassorted H5N1 virus. one study introduced mutations known to switch the receptor binding specificity of the H5 HA protein to (2,6)-linked sialic acid. yet the engineered H5N1 virus still failed to transmit, implying other molecular changes are needed. a single mutation in the HA protein that lowers the HA activation pH to 5.5 is not sufficient to promote contact transmission in ferrets. the results from the present study suggest a lower risk that circulating avian-like H5N1 influenza viruses will jump species to humans. eight mutations in H5 viruses have already been reported to decrease the HA activation pH. these residues are located throughout the prefusion HA protein in four broad regions that undergo dramatic changes in secondary and tertiary structure after acid-induced, irreversible activation. HA protein identifies the locations of acid stabilizing mutations. HA1 subunits are colored blue, HA2 is red, and HA2 is black. HA2-K58I is a gain-of-function mutation. the VN1203-HA2-K58I virus is susceptible to oseltamivir. a vaccine containing the parental VN1203 HA protein is available (44) the virus was not actively adapted during experiments in ferrets. tissues were destroyed after titers were measured. knowledge of the results described here may benefit public health in several ways. this work provides a preferred HA activation pH (5.5) for H5N1 and specific HA mutations that enhance its acid stability. understanding interspecies adaptation will assist in risk assessment, prepandemic vaccine selection, and decisions to cull animals or quarantine humans."}
