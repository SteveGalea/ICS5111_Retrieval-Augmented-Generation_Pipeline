{"summary": "Achromobacter xylosoxidans is the most prevalent pathogen in cystic fibrosis (CF) (1, 2, 4) studies investigating the diversity of Achromobacter spp. isolated from the airways of CF patients showed that Achromobacter spp. mostly originate from sporadic acquisition rather than from cross-transmissions or from diffusion of a limited number of clones with epidemic success. two studies dedicated to searching for A. xylosoxidans were conducted on environmental samples of various origins but not in CF patient households. in those studies, Achromobacter appeared to be widely distributed in natural hydrosystems, houses, and hospitals. the performance of the Achromobacter selective agar medium described by Amoureux et al. has not been fully validated. the strategy performed in this study was to screen cultures obtained on a nonselective medium by applying the genus-specific PCR before cultivating the samples onto the selective medium. the prevalence of members of the genus Achromobacter was 33.7% in the collection of 273 samples from CF patient houses. isolates were isolated by culture from only 16.5% of the PCR-positive samples. mucicolens 349 A. radiobacter A. mucicolens 349 A. mucicolens 349 A. mucicolens 349 a Sample identification (ID) is composed of the patient number followed by the sample number. the majority of PCR-positive samples came from indoors (82.5%), mostly from wet sites (78%) the majority of positive samples came from the kitchen for P5 and P12 (28.5% and 50% respectively) and from the garden for P2 (35%). water-containing evacuation systems were contaminated by Achromobacter spp. but also by several other known CF opportunistic pathogens (17\u201320), including Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Bordetella, Ochrobactrum, and Agrobacterium/Rhizobium. obacter mucicolens was isolated from various types of samples. strains of 2 STs differing by 2 alleles were coisolated in a soil sample. xylosoxidans ST175 was identified in 4 samples and associated with A. xylosoxidans ST169 in the floor cloth water sample. in our study were considered minor CF-associated species in several studies. in contrast, A. xylosoxidans, the major species identified in CF patients, chronically colonizing 80% of the CF patients in our center (7), was recovered from only one house. ciprofloxacin- and/or imipenem-resistant A. xylosoxidans strains from non-CF domestic environments in france (100% and 10% of 9 isolates, respectively) 15. antimicrobial susceptibility results for Achromobacter strains isolated from domestic environment samples and from the respiratory tract of the 3 CF patients.

CF patients were chronically colonized by burkholderia cepacia complex bacteria. a study of toothbrushes showed no relationship between pulmonary colonization and toothbrush contamination. Achromobacter-specific PCR in silico performances. only three regions allowing primer design (20 to 30 bp) showed sequences conserved among members of the Achromobacter genus and distinct from those of other genera. the performance of the Achromobacter selective agar medium described by Amoureux et al. has not been fully validated. the strategy performed in this study was to screen cultures obtained on a nonselective medium by applying the genus-specific PCR before cultivating the samples onto the selective medium. a total of 316 colonies corresponding to different morphotypes were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization\u2013time of flight mass spectrometry ( bacteria identified by MALDI-TOF P2-20 Bathroom Right sink siphon water A. aegrifaciens 350 A. radiobacter, P. nitroreducens A. aegrifaciens 350 P2-97 Garden Inside water hose swab A. animicus 360 Bordetella sp., Pseudomonas sp.

(15) consisting of MacConkey agar (MCK; BD) supplemented with 5 g/liter of xylose, 10 mg/liter of aztreonam, 5 mg/liter of amphotericin B, and 5 mg/liter of vanco PCR was performed in 50 l containing 20 pM each primer, 0.2 mM each deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP), 2.5 mM MgCl2 and 1 l of DNA extract from a TS-cultivable community. the conditions for amplification were initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 3 min followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 1 min. the corresponding selective agar plates were screened for Achromobacter cultivation. one colony per morphotype (mainly pink and beige) was isolated. the results obtained for environmental isolates were deposited in the Achromobacter PubMLST database."}
