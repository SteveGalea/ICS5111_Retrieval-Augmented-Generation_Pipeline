{"summary": "in 1990, the gold laboratory first described a process, termed Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX) [1], which identifies one or few molecular recognition elements (MREs) with high affinity and specificity toward their intended targets. all types of MREs are capable of binding to user-defined targets with high affinity and specificity. nucleic acid MREs with high specificity and affinity toward their targets can be identified. a random library consisting of up to 1015 single-stranded nucleic acids molecules are incubated with the target of interest. those that do not bind to negative targets are retained, amplified, and subjected to further rounds of in vitro selection. ssDNA MREs with known sequences can be chemically synthesized at low cost and without batch to batch variations. different modifications such as thiol or amino functional groups can also be easily incorporated onto the 3\u2032 and/or 5\u2032 ends of oligonucleotides during synthesis. labeling molecules such as biotin or FITC can also be covalently attached and serve as reporters in sensing applications. the SELEX process begins by incubating up to 1015 different ssDNA molecules with the target of interest. a round of negative selection is typically performed prior to the start of the first round of positive selection. magnetic beads have also been used to immobilize a wide range of targets. asymmetric PCR, biotin-streptavidin separation, lambda exonuclease digestions, and size separation on denaturing urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. asymmetric PCR uses a different ratio of forward and reverse primer in the reaction mixture to generate biotinylated dsDNA. the dsDNA is then excised and purified using sodium hydroxide. general process of SELEX has been modified over the past two decades. modifications focus on increasing the efficiency in separating bound and unbound MREs, increasing specificity of selected MREs, eliminating the need for immobilization. negative or counter selection is incorporated into the normal SELEX process by introducing negative targets that have structural similarity to the target of interest. berezovski and coworkers were the first to use Non-SELEX to identify a high affinity MRE (K d: 0.3 nM) specific for hRas protein [22]. park and coworkers developed an immobilization-free SELEX method based on - stacking interaction between DNA and graphene oxide (GO-SELEX) FluMag-SELEX was developed by Stoltenburg and coworkers by immobilizing targets on magnetic beads using fluorescently labeled forward primer. however, the overall binding capacity of the library can be monitored precisely with the presence of fluorescence tag. the selection process can then be terminated when the overall library binding affinity toward the target reaches a plateau. multiple pathogenic bacteria genera, such as Salmonella, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, Listeria, and Escherichia have been chosen as a selection target. single-stranded DNA MREs targeting bacteria can be classified into two general categories, (1) targeting whole cells with known or unknown molecular targets.

Upon target binding, the linked AuNPs are released. in a sandwich assay, biotinylated MREs can be immobilized on streptavidin plate. this is followed by the addition of the protein target, HRP linked antibody, and enzyme substrate. this detection method is mostly limited to clinical laboratory settings. a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) is an acoustic wave resonator based on the piezoelectric property of quartz crystal. the binding between target and MRE increases the mass on the surface of the crystal. the detection principle of surface acoustic wave based biosensor is similar to QCM. ssDNA MRE is usually immobilized on a gold electrode via thiol-gold linkage. a redox label, such as methylene blue, can be used to detect binding between MRE and the target. a \u201csignal off\u201d system behaves similarly, but the binding of target causes the redox label to move away from the electrode. in this system, MREs are immobilized on SWCNTs and SWCNTs are sandwiched between a source and a drain electrode. when the immobilized MREs bind to the target, there is a measurable change in the conductance of the system. gold nanoparticles (AuNP) are also widely used as signal enhancers. principle of fluorescence detection is based on the generation or quenching of fluorescence signals upon target binding. Various fluorescence molecules and quantum dots can be linked to ssDNA MREs. conformational changes induced by target binding can alter the fluorescence signal generated by the fluorophore. AuNPs aggregate in salt solution and appear in purple color. when targets are introduced into the system, MRE preferably bind to the targets, thus causing AuNPs to aggregate. ssDNA MREs can be used to link AuNPs functionalized with probe strands. biotinylated MREs can be immobilized on streptavidin plate and then followed by the addition of the protein target, HRP linked antibody, and enzyme substrate. this detection method is mostly limited to clinical laboratory settings and detection of protein targets for which antibodies have been isolated. one study reported a portable SPR biosensor based on ssDNA MREs. when targets bind to immobilized MREs, a change in plasmon resonance and plasmon angle will be detected and translated into a real-time response unit. a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) is an acoustic wave resonator based on the piezoelectric property of quartz crystal. fluorescence detection is based on the generation or quenching of fluorescence signals upon target binding. Various fluorescence molecules and quantum dots can be linked to ssDNA MREs. the same principle can also be applied for a \u201csignal off\u201d system. colorimetric gold nanoparticles (AuNP) have been widely used in various colorimetric assays. auNPs aggregate in salt solution and appear in purple color. when targets are introduced into the system, MRE preferably bind to the targets, thus causing AuNPs to aggregate. absorbance Nucleic acid MREs have been used in modified enzyme linked immunoassays. in a direct oligonucleotide enzyme link assay, often the protein target is adsorbed on plate. biotinylated MREs can be immobilized on streptavidin plate and then followed by the addition of the protein target, HRP linked antibody, and enzyme substrate. a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) is an acoustic wave resonator based on the piezoelectric property of quartz crystal. the binding between target and MRE increases the mass on the surface of the crystal and leads to a detectable decrease in the resonance frequency. the development of ssDNA MRE based biosensors is becoming an increasingly diverse field. a nanometer scale deflection in the cantilever can be detected optically. ssDNA MREs have several advantages over antibodies, in terms of stability, reusability, and production cost. portable ssDNA MRE based biosensors may be used in food safety, environmental monitoring, and health care. the commercialization of these devices should continue to increase in the future."}
