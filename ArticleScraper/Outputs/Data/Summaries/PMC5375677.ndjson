{"summary": "genus consists of nine recognized virus species, including the prototypic species vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and Isfahan virus (ISFV) (2). transmission to susceptible hosts occurs via biting insects, most likely sandflies. virus is found only in the Americas and is an important pathogen of domesticated animals, mostly ungulates. the VSV and ISFV genomes consist of a nonsegmented, single-strand, negative-sense RNA 11 kb in length containing five genes in the order 3\u2032-N-P-M-G-L-5\u2032. the particles are bullet-shaped (80 nm by 200 nm) and comprise a ribonucleoprotein core of genomic RNA and N (nucleocapsid) protein surrounded by a matrix (M) the safety of rVSIV vectors initially was a concern because both VSIV and the new jersey serotype of VSV are known to have neurotropic properties in young mice. the most promising strategy was a combination of N gene translocation with a truncation of the cytoplasmic tail (CT) of the G protein. rVSIV-N4CT1HIVgag1 demonstrated safety at a dose as high as 108 PFU and immunogenicity at a dose as low as 104 PFU (42) an important target of biodefense vaccines are members of the genus Alphavirus of the family Togaviridae. the two aquatic alphavirus complexes are not known to utilize arthropods in their transmission cycles. new world alphaviruses such as WEEV, EEEV, and VEEV can cause fatal encephalitis. human case fatality rates for EEEV range from 40 to 80%, whereas those for WEEV and VEEV infections range from 1 to 5% (1). there are no licensed antiviral treatments or vaccines for alphaviral diseases. list of rhabdovirus sequences used in analyses Species Abbreviation GenBank accession no.

VEEV PRNT80 titers of 20 were detected in 60% and 80% of mice at days 14 and 21 postvaccination. EEEV-neutralizing antibody responses were also detected at both time points in all mice. all sham-vaccinated mice had PRNT80 values below the limit of detection. short- and long-term protection induced by rISFV- and rVSIV-VEEV vectors was assessed by vaccinating cohorts of 10 CD-1 mice with 108 and 107 PFU/mouse of each vaccine vector. antibody responses were measured via a PRNT80 assay at days 25, 35, and 245 postvaccination. titers were maintained for the duration of the study. animals were vaccinated with 108 or 107 PFU and challenged with lethal VEEV-ID at 35 and 245 days postinfection. neutralizing antibody response measured by a PRNT80 assay following vaccination. survival following lethal VEEV-ID challenge via the s.c. route. rhabdovirus sequences used in analyses Species Abbreviation GenBank accession no.

ISFV is more closely related to CHNV, JURV, PERV, PIRV, and MSPV than to VSIV and VSNJV. in vitro characterization of wild-type (wt) isolates of ISFV and VSIV were compared. assays of replication kinetics (C) of all viruses were performed at an MOI of 10 PFU/cell in triplicate. the assembly of a full-length rISFV genomic cDNA and plasmids expressing the ISFV proteins was carried out in a manner similar to that used previously for the generation of rVSIV and mumps virus. the full-length viral genome was cloned in 5 fragments flanked by restriction sites. the 3\u2032 leader and 5\u2032 trailer were flanked by the T7 RNA polymerase promoter and terminator. the hepatitis delta virus ribozyme sequence was used to generate a precise 5\u2032 trailer nucleotide sequence. the gene of rISFV-VEEV, rISFV-EEEV, and rVSIV-VEEV vectors was relocated to the fourth position of the genome. the rVSIV-VEEV vector also has a 28-amino-acid truncation in the cytoplasmic tail of the G protein. animals were challenged subcutaneously (s.c.) with 104 PFU/mouse of VEEV-ID. weight loss was observed by as early as 2 days postchallenge in sham-vaccinated animals. by day 8 postchallenge, all mice showed signs of severe illness. sham-vaccinated mice succumbed to disease starting at day 5 postchallenge. 60% met euthanasia criteria, while none of the vaccinated mice showed any signs of disease. an attenuated rISFV-EEEV vector expressing E3-E1 antigens could protect mice against lethal VEEV and EEEV challenges following a single i.m. vaccination. VEEV PRNT80 titers of 20 were detected in 60% and 80% of mice. sham-vaccinated mice succumbed to infection and were euthanized within 7 days of challenge, while vaccinated mice remained free of detectable disease. a single dose of blended rISFV-VEEV and -EEEV vaccines can provide complete protection from lethal VEEV and EEEV challenges. short- and long-term protection induced by rVSIV and rISFV-VEEV vectors was assessed by vaccinating cohorts of 10 CD-1 mice with 108 and 107 PFU/mouse of each vaccine vector. antibody responses were measured via a PRNT80 assay at days 25, 35, and 245 postvaccination. rISFV and rVSIV vaccine vectors could elicit a durable neutralizing antibody response. outline of the study design in CD-1 mice. animals were vaccinated with 108 or 107 PFU and challenged with lethal VEEV-ID at 35 and 245 days postinfection. rVSIV-N4CT1gag1 vector demonstrated safety and immunogenicity in phase I clinical trials. this vaccine candidate was included in our studies as a comparator to the novel rISFV vector(s) and as a candidate stand-alone vaccine(s) to prevent alphavirus-induced disease. unmodified wt ISFV was 1,000-fold more attenuated than wt VSIV. this was based on the amount of infectious virus required to provide a measureable 50% lethal dose (LD50), presumably due to inherently lower-virulence properties and likely reducing the need for extensive attenuation. the latter is also supported by the absence of any clinical signs of disease after vaccination of mice. rISFV vectors expressing VEEV/EEEV E3-E1 were selected for expression by rISFV vectors because they contain major virus neutralization epitopes. the complete E3-E1 polyprotein was expressed from a single rISFV transcription unit in each case. the additional expression cassette was positioned in the fifth position of the rISFV vector in each case to limit the amount of the E3-E1 protein expressed. western blot analysis indicated that the level of rISFV-VEEV protein expression was lower than that expressed by rVSIV-VEEV. a single i.m. dose of either rISFV-VEEV or rISFV-EEEV elicited neutralizing antibody responses and provided complete protection from disease following lethal challenge with VEEV or EEEV. rISFV and rVSIV dose-down study indicated a more durable neutralizing antibody response may be elicited by a higher vaccine dose. but protection from disease was still achieved following challenge at 245 days postvaccination. rVSIV-VEEV vector demonstrated 100% protection of mice from lethal VEEV challenge following a single i.m. vaccine dose. VEEV ZPC 738 and EEEV FL93-939 were obtained from the world reference center for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses at the University of Texas Medical Branch. the vero cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Bethesda, MD) cDNA for nucleotide sequencing and assembly of a full-length genomic cDNA was generated by reverse transcription (RT) using the superscript III system (Invitrogen, alameda, CA), using random hexamers. PCR products were purified by using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen) each cDNA fragment was cloned into pBluescript (Invitrogen) in a stepwise manner. rISFV genomic cDNA was also manipulated in a similar fashion to translocate the N gene from position 1 to position 4 in the genome. an expression cassette was then inserted at position 5 between the N and the L genes to accommodate VEEV and EEEV E2/E1 ORFs. rISFV and rVSIV vector genomes were engineered to contain discrete transcriptional start and stop signals flanked by XhoI and NotI restriction sites. all rISFV and rVSV vectors were rescued by electroporation of cDNA plasmids into vero cells. all rISFV and rVSV vectors were rescued by electroporation of cDNA plasmids. cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended at 107 cells per 700 l in 1 DMEM containing sodium pyruvate (1 mM), 0.4% 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% (vol/vol) nonessential amino acids, and DMSO. DNA mixture (250 l) and Vero cells (700 l) were then mixed by gentle pipetting. electroporation was performed at 140 V, the pulse length was 70 ms, the cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.5 PFU/cell. cell supernatant was clarified by centrifugation at 3,000 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. titration was performed on 100% confluent vero cell monolayers seed. duplicate wells were infected with 0.1-ml aliquots of serially 10-fold-diluted virus in growth medium. 0.4 ml of growth medium was added to each well to prevent cell desiccation. cells were incubated at 32\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 1 to 3 days. the virus inoculum was adsorbed for 15 min at room temperature, followed by 30 min at 37\u00b0C. additional growth medium was then added, and cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C. at 24 hpi, cells were scraped into the suspension and collected by centrifugation at 3,000 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. mice were challenged with a lethal dose (104 PFU) of either VEEV-ID or EEEV-NA by s.c. injection. mice were euthanized with the onset of neurological disease. RStudio (version 0.97; RStudio, Boston, MA) running R (version 3.0.1; R Development Core Team, Vienna, Austria) software was used for statistical analysis. significant differences in mean titers between wt viruses and attenuated vaccine constructs were determined by using two-way analysis of variance. an infectious rISFV cDNA clone was generated by amplifying the genome in five DNA fragments flanked by compatible unique restriction enzyme sites. the full-length ISFV genome nucleotide sequence was determined from viral RNA isolated from the cell culture supernatant by using the QIAamp viral RNA minikit (Qiagen, Alameda, CA) rVSIV-N4CT1gag1 cDNA was used as the starting template. positions of the N gene and the GCT-1 gene were switched. the expression cassette in position 1 was relocated to position 5 between the N and L genes of this vector. rISFV genomic cDNA was also manipulated in a similar fashion. rISFV and rVSIV vectors were rescued by electroporation of cDNA plasmids into vero cells. all rISFV and rVSIV vectors were rescued by electroporation of cDNA plasmids into vero cells. cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended, and washed in 20 ml of 1 DMEM containing 10% (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum (FBS), sodium pyruvate (1 mM), 1% (vol/vol) nonessential amino acids, and 0.4% 2-mercaptoethanol (Invitrogen) cell growth medium was replaced at 2 days postelectroporation with 1 DMEM containing 2% (vol/vol) FBS, sodium pyruvate (1 mM), 1% (vol/vol) nonessential amino acids, and gentamicin (50 g/ml) flasks monitored for CPE for 14 days postelectroporation. tant was underlaid with 14 ml of 10% (wt/vol) sucrose in a Beckmann Ultraclear tube. after centrifugation, supernatants were aspirated, and the virus pellet was resuspended in PBS. titration was performed on 100% confluent Vero cell monolayers seeded overnight in six-well plates. incubation, the inoculum was removed, monolayers were rinsed five times with room-temperature DMEM to remove any unbound virus. 0.5-ml of growth medium was added to each flask, and 0.5 ml of growth medium was added to each flask. antisera were diluted 1:1,000 in diluent provided in the western Breeze kit. color was allowed to develop after the addition of a chromogenic substrate. nitrocellulose membrane was then rinsed with distilled H2O and air dried. mice were challenged with a lethal dose (104 PFU) of either VEEV-ID or EEEV-NA. mice were subsequently challenged with 105 PFU by i.p. injection."}
