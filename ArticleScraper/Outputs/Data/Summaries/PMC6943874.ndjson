{"summary": "clinical significance of respiratory viruses (RVs) as an etiology of pneumonia in liver disease patients with cirrhosis is usually underestimated. a prospective study was conducted in a tertiary care CCU. cirrhotic patients with pneumonia were included, viral and bacterial etiology of pneumonia was identified. pneumonia in cirrhotic patients which include acute on chronic liver failure, multiple organ failure, sepsis, prolonged hospitalization, and mortality. majority of the studies focused on bacterial pneumonia as the most common cause of pneumonia in cirrhotic patients. there is no published study showing the influence of respiratory viruses (RVs) in clinical outcome of cirrhotic patients in CCU. TS and NS were collected from nonventilated patients with pneumonia. TS and NS were collected from nonventilated patients. data were presented as mean standard deviation or an absolute number and percentage. data were recorded and analyzed using SPSS (version 21.0; SPSS) the exclusion criteria included: (1) under 18 years; (2) pregnancy; (3) patients with immunosuppression as a result of cytotoxic or corticosteroids. TS and NS were collected from nonventilated patients with pneumonia. all samples were stored at 80\u00b0C till further processing. commercial kit capable of detection and quantification of 33 different pathogens. results expressed as copies/ml, and linear range of assay is 102\u2013109 copies/ml. multiplex quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was done using commercial kit capable of detection and quantification of 33 different pathogens. results were expressed as copies/ml, and linear range of the assay is 102\u2013109 copies/ml. Coronavirus OC43 Haemophilus influenzae Coronavirus HKU1 Mycoplasma pneumoniae Human metapneumovirus Rhinovirus Respiratory syncytial virus Adenovirus Enterovirus Enterovirus Parechovirus Bocavirus. 88 patients (65.1%) underwent bronchoscopy BAL for etiologic diagnosis of pneumonia. overall prevalence of RVs was found in 30 (22.2%) cirrhotic patients with pneumonia. both viral and bacterial coinfections were seen in 16 (11.8%) cirrhotic patients with pneumonia. the proportion of RV infections were little higher in HAP group than in the CAP group. patients with median ICU stay of cirrhotic patients with pneumonia were 11 days (interquartile range [IQR]: 2\u201323 days) there was no significant difference in median length of stay of patients in viral infections and viral\u2013bacterial coinfection (9.0 [IQR: 2\u201330] and 10 [IQR: 5\u201332] days, respectively). HAP (n=86) P Isolated viral etiology 30 13 17 0.47 RhV 9 3 6 0.85 Flu A 5 4 1 0.85 HCOV 3 0 3 0.19 RSV 3 0 3 0.19 HPIV 2 1 1 0.69 HAdV + RhV 2 1 1 0.69 HMPV 1 1 0 0.18 HAdV + HPIV 1 1 1 0.45 HCOV + RSV 1 0 1 0.45 Legionella pneumophila 1 1 in the current study, the proportion of RVs detected from BAL samples was more than TS/NS though not significant. however, in the current study, the proportion of RVs detected from BAL samples were more than TS/NS though not significant. this is due to ease of specimen collection in comparison to bronchoscopy collected BAL sample. mixed viral and bacterial infections are widely described in pneumonia patients in CCUs. however, the presence of these coinfections on the cirrhotic patients\u2019 clinical outcome remains poorly studied."}
