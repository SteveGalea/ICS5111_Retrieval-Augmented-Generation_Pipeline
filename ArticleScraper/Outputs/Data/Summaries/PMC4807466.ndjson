{"summary": "investigators have speculated about a role for local lymphoid aggregates in protective immunity to Chlamydia. this concept is not featured in working models of Chlamydia immunopathogenesis. it is unclear whether cytokine polarization is the appropriate framework for understanding. TISSUE-RESIDENT MEMORY T CELLS Trm were originally described for CD8 T cells in the setting of recurrent herpes simplex virus reactivations. when HSV reactivates due to UV exposure or stress, it travels back down the nerve axon and infects the stromal cells adjacent to nerve endings at the site of the original infection. trachoma conjunctival biopsy specimens showed conjunctival follicle architecture consisting of prominent B cell component. baboons transcervically infected with C. trachomatis serovar E and macaque salpingeal pockets repeatedly infected with C. trachomatis serovar D showed germinal center formation (follicles) that included plasma cells on routine histology of the cervix and salpingeal tissue the CD4 T cell clusters in the endometrium had a significant B cell component early and some macrophages with rare CD8 T cells. they were no longer detectable in clusters at late time points based on staining for B220 and CD19, which do not detect plasma cells. INE POLARIZATION Chlamydia pathogenesis research has shown that the IFN- pathway plays an important role in protective immunity. in the mid-1990s, it was shown that IFN- and T cell contact resulted in upregulated epithelial inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) genes and nitric oxide production sufficient to kill intracellular mouse and human Chlamydia. iNOS gene knockout mice clear C. muridarum because they still have the Plac8 gene-dependent mechanism. earliest came from adoptive transfer of Chlamydia-specific T cell clones. antigens and adjuvants that generated multifunctional cytokine responses were protective. trachoma immunoepidemiology suggested the importance of the Th1/Th2 framework (41), later studies failed to support the concept. IL-13 production as measured by transcriptomics was epidemiologically correlated with protection in the latter study. guinea pigs that clear a GPIC ocular infection cannot be reinfected ocularly and have no immunopathology on rechallenge. the primary ocular infections left behind a local memory response. a characteristic feature of Trm is expansion in their nonlymphoid tissue residence during recall responses. y et al. (49) showed that mucosal but not systemic immunization with an experimental Chlamydia vaccine resulted in the seeding of the mucosa with effector T cells that established Trm and protective immunity. we propose a working model for protective immunity to Chlamydia infections of the eyes and genital mucosal surfaces based on Trm. lamydia explain the protection seen in our sex worker cohort study in 2005. the alternative cytokine polarization narrative would be that protected individuals harbor distinct Chlamydia-specific Th1 and Th2 responses. instead, we favor a model in which protective immunity is mediated by Trm. uterine c-MLC contain almost exclusively CD4 T cells in the mouse model. trachoma isolates (serovars A to C) have nonfunctional tryptophan synthesis operons (52), suggesting that the presence of IFN-induced indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase is not consequential to Chlamydia replication in the eye. chlamydial forms in splenic APC could be a source for persistent presentation of a subset of chlamydial antigens that include that encoded by the PmpG gene. a unique feature of c-MLC is that immune B cells may be a (or) critical APC. a B cell-centered c-MLC model would predict that B cell-deficient mice would have impaired recall immune responses due to an altered MLC. protective immunity occurs when epithelial surface area protected by Trm reaches critical mass as a result of prolonged or repeated infections. it is possible that the Trm within MLC induced by trachoma and genital tract infections are different, possibly mirroring different microenvironments. edward et al."}
