{"summary": "a lack of robust laboratory systems can impede disease detection, control and prevention efforts (7\u20139). these circumstances highlight the importance of building sustainable national health laboratory systems. such systems require laboratory leaders who can lead and manage laboratories under any circumstances including potentially turbulent environments. this CF will facilitate the development of training programs for laboratory leaders to acquire the knowledge, skills and abilities to successfully build sustainable national health laboratory systems. the CF embodies a One Health approach and considers a \u201cNational Health Laboratory System\u201d as a network including human, animal, environmental, agricultural, food, aquatic and chemical laboratories in support of health systems. the CF specifically integrates competencies applicable to laboratory experts and current leaders and managers from different sectors addressing and aligning disparate terminology. Competencies Description The CF was designed to outline the nine essential competencies needed for laboratory leaders to build sustainable national health laboratory systems. the individual analyses and independently applies principles, concepts and/or methodologies related to the competency as attained through education or training. the individual has demonstrated significant success in performing the most demanding assignments requiring the competency. Competency 1: Laboratory System A laboratory system and the network of laboratories that make up the system are key to the provision of laboratory services in support of a health system. this competency encompasses the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed to develop, maintain and strengthen a complete and functional health laboratory system capable of producing high quality results with efficient procedures, administration and policies. Competency 2: Leadership Leadership is essential for success in the fast-paced, changing environment of health laboratory systems. Competency 6: Biosafety and biosecurity Strong leadership is needed to ensure the necessary safeguards are in place to protect laboratory personnel and the population from biohazards. Competency 7: Disease Surveillance and Outbreak Investigation Laboratory data is essential for accurate disease surveillance, detection and investigation. Competency 8: Emergency Preparedness, Response and Recovery Emergencies provide unique challenges to a laboratory system. national health laboratory system Is defined as network that Includes human, animal, environmental, agricultural, food, aquatic, and chemical laboratories in support of health systems. each partner's expertise, experience and lessons learned in the field. the Workgroup designed the structure of the framework, developed descriptions of each competency and defined competency domains, subdomains, and areas of activity. the action verbs that describe the levels of proficiency for each area of activity were developed based on the Structure of the Observed Learning Outcome (SOLO) (22) and Bloom's (23) taxonomies. some modifications of the verbs were incorporated to represent learning outcomes specifically related to leadership. the individual has advanced knowledge of the principles, concepts and/or methodologies related to the competency as attained through education or training. the individual analyses and independently applies principles, concepts and/or methodologies related to the competency as attained through education or training. the individual has demonstrated significant success in performing the most demanding assignments requiring the competency. competency includes the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed to develop, maintain and strengthen a complete and functional health laboratory system capable of producing high quality results with efficient procedures, administration and policies throughout all levels of the health system. Competency 2: Leadership Leadership is essential for success in the fast-paced, changing environment of health laboratory systems. competency includes the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed to communicate laboratory findings and laboratory system related information across sectors and disciplines. competency includes the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed to plan, conduct and analyze hypothesis-driven investigations. competency includes the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed to plan, conduct and analyze hypothesis-driven investigations. the complete CF can be found here: https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/311445/9789241515108-eng.pdf. the full Framework can be accessed on the World Health Organization website Competency 1. Laboratory System Knowledge, skills, and abilities needed to develop, maintain and strengthen a complete and functional national health laboratory system. the CF is designed to allow for the incremental development of skills from the developing to expert levels. it can be used at institutional and individual levels for: Workforce development: as a foundation for laboratory leadership curricula and programs. the CF addresses environmental aspects but recognizes that the integration of environmental health input has been limited to date. the incorporation of environmental considerations remains ongoing. the CF serves as a foundation for the GLLP, a comprehensive program encompassing the nine laboratory leadership competencies. CF and development of other learning programs Ideally, the nine competencies will be taken in their entirety with activity areas in each competency reinforcing other competencies. each competency is designed to allow complementary learning opportunities for individual and specific competency development as needed. the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
