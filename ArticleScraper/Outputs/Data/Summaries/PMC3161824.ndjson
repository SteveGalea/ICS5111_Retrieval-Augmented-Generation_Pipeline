{"summary": "identifying host factors and pathways exploited in virus replication represent major challenges and opportunities for understanding and controlling viruses. positive-strand RNA viruses comprise over one third of all virus genera. positive-strand RNA viruses comprise over one third of all virus genera. doxycycline (dox)-repressible library of 900 yeast strains. each of which allows repressing the expression of a selected essential gene. these host factors are involved in protein homeostasis, protein trafficking, and translation. pB3BG29, based on pB3Rluc [9], uses a truncated promoter to express RNA3 with the coat protein ORF replaced by the Renilla luciferase (Rluc) ORF. pB3MS82 expresses a BMV RNA3 derivative in which the coat protein gene has a four-nucleotide insertion and a point mutation, abolishing expression of the coat protein. pB12VG1 and pB3BG29 were used in reporter gene-based primary screens. pB12VG1 and pB3MS82 were used in secondary validation testing. PTET essential yeast strains were grown to saturation overnight at 30\u00b0C in 96-well plates. Strains were grown in 96-well plates for luciferase assays. 2.5 l of cells were lysed in 1 Passive Lysis Buffer. 25 l of Luciferase Assay Substrate was injected and read for 1 s. s were detected using 32P-labeled probes specific for positive- or negative-strand BMV RNA3 and RNA4 as previously described [24] the 18S rRNA probe was derived from pTRI RNA 18S templates (Ambion, Austin, TX) one-sided t-statistics were used to identify the dox-treated strains whose RNA replication was statistically significantly altered compared to untreated strains. p-values from t-statistics were converted to q-values to control for false discovery rate. pB3MS82 expresses a BMV RNA3 derivative in which the coat protein gene has a four-nucleotide insertion and a point mutation. the coat protein gene has a four-nucleotide insertion and a point mutation, abolishing expression of the coat protein. 96-well plates of transformed yeast were re-formatted to contain 48 strains in duplicate per plate. strains were grown overnight in medium containing raffinose. cells were analyzed at 24 hr and 48 hr post gal-induction of virus expression. for each pass of the 741 PTET strains, we calculated BMV-directed Rluc expression. the dox-treated to untreated ratio of ratios was calculated and converted to fold change. RNAs were detected using 32P-labeled probes specific for positive- or negative-strand BMV RNA3 and RNA4 as previously described. mouse anti-BMV 2aPol at 13,000, and mouse anti-Pgk1p at 110,000 using HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. log transformation was applied to [RNA4/18S rRNA]dox-treated/[RNA4/18S rRNA]untreated ratios from Northern blotting data. p-values from t-statistics were converted to q-values to control for false discovery rate [37] pB12VG1 expresses BMV RNA replication proteins 1a and 2aPol. pB3BG29 expresses an Rluc reporter-expressing BMV RNA3 cDNA derivative. DNA-dependent transcription produces an initial (+)RNA3 transcript that serves as a template for 1a- and 2aPol-dependent RNA3 replication. 892 yeast strains, each with a single essential gene promoter replaced by a doxycycline (dox)-repressible promoter, were transformed with BMV expression plasmids. transformants were re-formatted on 96-well plates with duplicates of each strain present on the same plate. expression levels from the substituted TET promoter are often different than expression levels from the endogenous gene promoter [27] each treated strain was compared to its untreated counterpart. strains were sub-cultured into galactose-containing selective medium 10 g/ml dox. strains in this library exhibit growth defects in the presence of dox (20% of which exhibit growth defects even in the absence of dox) stringent growth requirements were employed to minimize false positives. each strain was required to double at least twice between 0\u201324 hr in galactose-containing media. a 6-fold cutoff was used in the primary screen in response to our observation that some strains in this essential gene library showed more luciferase assay variability than in our previous screen of non-essential genes. this increased variability is likely due to the fact that these genes are essential for cell growth. UTP18 11 50 YGR251W N/Ab 33 150 a RIO2 was identified at the 24 hr time point. all other genes were identified at the 48 hr time point. the 42 candidate genes identified in the reporter gene-based primary screens were transformed with the 1a- and 2aPol-expressing plasmid pB12VG1 and with a plasmid expressing RNA3 retaining the BMV coat protein ORF. the levels of RNA3 and RNA4 replication products then were measured by northern blotting. RNA4 level is the parameter most closely related to the Rluc expression measured in the primary screen. 19 of the 23 genes (83% confirmation) at the commonly applied false discovery rate of 5%. false discovery rate analysis is a robust statistical method that controls multiple test variables by calculating an adjusted, more stringent p-value. levels of ()RNA3 were increased 1.4- to 5-fold in the 19 confirmed strains. 19 confirmed dox-repressed genes that enhanced BMV RNA accumulation encode proteins with functions in varied cellular processes. the 19 confirmed dox-repressed genes that enhanced BMV RNA accumulation encode proteins with functions in varied processes. naJ family J-protein that functions with Hsp70 in Fe-S cluster biogenesis in mitochondria PRE1 Beta 4 subunit of the 20S core of the 26S proteasome PFY1 Binds profilin, actin and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. naJ family J-protein that functions with Hsp70 in Fe-S cluster biogenesis in mitochondria PRE1 Beta 4 subunit of the 20S core of the 26S elongation factor required for the maintenance of chromatin structure during transcription SWD2 Required for methylation of histone H3 and RNA polymerase II transcription termination Cell Cycle/DNA Maintenance ADE13 Adenylosuccinate lyase involved in the purine nucleotide synthesis CDC53 A scaffolding subunit (cullin) required for SPB duplication a Bold font indicates genes whose repression inhibits viral RNA accumulation. dox-treated (10 g/ml) essential yeast strains expressing BMV 1a, 2aPol and RNA3 were detected by Northern blotting using probes specific for BMV RNA3 and RNA4. equal loading of total RNA was verified by probing for 18S rRNA. values represent the mean of four independent experiments. BMV 2aPol levels were significantly increased in PTET-HSF1, PTET-PRE1 and PTET-RPT6 dox-treated strains. in PTET-JAC1 dox-treated cells, 2aPol levels were elevated in the absence of dox, but reduced to near wild type levels in the presence of dox. this results suggest that viral protein regulation is unlikely to be the cause of altered viral RNA replication phenotypes upon depleting the products of this collection contains 900 yeast strains, each with a single endogenous essential gene promoter replaced by a tetracycline-repressible promoter. expression of the essential gene is repressed, and the protein depleted. to assess the role of essential genes in BMV RNA replication, we co-transformed each of the 900 strains. yeast genetic screen used to identify essential host factors affecting BMV RNA replication. pB12VG1 expresses replication factors 1a and 2aPol. pB3BG29 expresses Fluc and RNA3. chemiluminescent Renilla luciferase assay at 24 hr and 48 hr post-virus induction. cell viability and promoter launching were monitored with a chemiluminescent firefly luciferase assay at 24 hr and 48 hr post-virus induction. we measured Rluc at 24 hr and 48 hr post-virus induction for every strain. dox-induced growth defects were also assayed at 24 hr and 48 hr post-virus induction. dox-treated strains were closely monitored. analyzed strains showed >90% overlap between pass 1 and 2 at the 24 hr time point and >80% overlap between passes at the 48 hr time point. a more stringent 6-fold cutoff was used in the primary screen in response to our observation that some strains in this essential gene library showed more luciferase assay variability.

RNA4 was used as the primary measure of BMV RNA synthesis. unlike RNA3, RNA4 is only produced by viral RNA-dependent synthesis. RNA4 level is the parameter most closely related to the Rluc expression measured in the primary screen.

RNA3 was inhibited 5.5-, 1.8-, and 5.5-fold in these strains respectively. dox-induced repression of five essential yeast genes inhibits RNA replication. accumulation of BMV RNA replication proteins 1a and 2aPol was assayed by Western blotting. addition of dox to growth medium had no detectable effect on BMV 1a and 2aPol accumulation in wild type strains. for 20 of 24 confirmed hits, BMV 1a levels were comparable to their untreated sample. dox-repressible yeast strains identified 99 genes that inhibited or enhanced BMV RNA replication. dox-repressible library is powerful tool for analyzing the effects of essential genes on virus replication. over 70% of the strains exhibit growth defects in the presence of dox. the lower confirmation rate for the 19 candidate genes that inhibited BMV-directed Rluc expression may be because these primary screen candidates included false positives. the lower confirmation rate may be because these primary screen candidates included false positives arising from the tendency of essential gene depletion to produce non-specific inhibitory effects. depleting genes involved in processing cellular mRNA 3\u2032 ends (RNA15), regulating transcription (SPT6), modulating cellular gene expression (SWD2) and controlling nucleocytoplasmic trafficking (NUP57) may increase availability of ribosomes and/or alter levels of specific proteins, preferentially stimulating BMV RNA replication. further studies are necessary to define the role of these mRNA metabolism genes in BMV RNA replication. repressed cells may alter cell cycle signal transduction pathways. changes in isomerase activity can alter the structure, stability, or intracellular localization of client proteins. changes in isomerase activity can alter the structure, stability, or intracellular localization of client proteins. knockdown of cyclophilin A and loss of its PPIase activity severely inhibits hepatitis c virus replication [46], [47], [48], [51]. Conversely, siRNA-mediated knockdown of cyclophilin G mRNA stimulates hepatitis c virus replication [49]. repressing PTET-RPT6, one of six ATPases of the 19S regulatory particle of the 26S proteasome, resulted in an 90% reduction in BMV RNA replication. repressing PTET-PRE1 and PTET-RPT6 dox-repressed cells also showed a substantial increase in BMV 2aPol levels. dox-repression of Hsp70 cofactor JAC1 or heat shock protein transcription factor HSF1 significantly inhibits BMV RNA replication. arabidopsis encodes 18 Hsp70 family members and Hsp70s have been shown to affect the replication of other (+)RNA viruses in plants. viral activity against multiple diverse viruses has been through multiple clinical trials. many of the genes identified function in pathways utilized by other viruses and thus may present potential cellular targets for developing broad-spectrum antivirals."}
