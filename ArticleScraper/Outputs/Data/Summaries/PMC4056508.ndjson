{"summary": "infection control practices are geared towards reduction of occurrence and transmission of infectious diseases. a self-administered questionnaire was used to assess students' knowledge and attitudes regarding infection prevention and control and their sources of information. the prevalence of HIV in Namibia is 18.8% among ante-natal clinic attendees (MoHSS, 2010) and 56% among TB patients (MoHSS, 20113). Namibia has an alarmingly high TB burden reporting 12625 TB patients in 2010 with a notification rate of 589 cases per 100,000 population, one of the highest in the world. the university of Namibia was established in 1986 after a need was identified to train professional nurses in Namibia instead of depending on south africa. the Faculty offered mainly nursing sciences programmes until 1996 when the National Diploma in Radiography was introduced with the assistance of the world health organization. a new Faculty of Health Sciences and particularly a new School of Medicine to monitor and continually assess the knowledge acquired by the students in different subjects. a pre-designed, pre-tested, anonymous self-administered questionnaire was given to each student who had an informed consent to take part in the study. the questionnaire was pretested with more than ten respondents that included all students categories at the Faculty of Health Sciences of the University of Namibia. the least square difference method (LSD) was used as a post-hoc test to assess the significance of difference of the infection prevention and control score among the different groups of students. all p-values were two sided and considered statistically significant if 0.05. the mean scores for Medicine students were higher than both Radiology and Nursing (p0.05) by ANOVA with LSD post hoc test. the mean scores for Medicine students were higher than both Radiology and Nursing (p0.05) by ANOVA with LSD post hoc test. 24.1 48.4 6.0 20.2 Advanced age or very young age increases the risk of nosocomial infection 74.1 93.5 71.0 69.3 Invasive procedures increase the risk of nosocomial infection 86.4 96.8 70.6 86.0 Precaution standards - Include the recommendations to protect only the patients 89.5 84.0 88.2 91.2 Precaution standards - Include the recommendations to protect the patients. the health worker should: Should facility does not have autoclave, disinfection alone can make equipment safe, 71.0 77.4 58.8 71.1 The care of equipment involves the appropriate disposal of waste, contaminated laundry and sharp; the cleaning, sterilization and disinfection of equipment, instruments and devices. the health worker should: Should follow manufacturer and facility protocols in all instances 71.0 77.4 58.8 71.1 The care of equipment: The care of equipment involves the appropriate disposal of waste, contaminated health workers who believe they have been contaminated with an infectious agent should not Know and review their immunization status with their primary health care provider. only 24.1% of all respondents gave a correct answer to the question related to the environment (air, water, inert surfaces) as the major source of bacteria responsible for Nosocomial infection. study shows that there is higher knowledge among medical students compared to nursing/radiography students. there is an increasing number of health care workers in developed and developing countries who have been exposed to infection to blood-borne pathogens while caring of patients. knowledge of guidelines has been associated with better hand-hygiene practices. research has consistently identified improvement in overall hand-hygiene practices by interventions targeting at improving knowledge among healthcare workers. social services should intensify hand washing in clinical settings. teaching methods should be improved or modified to increase knowledge of infection control."}
