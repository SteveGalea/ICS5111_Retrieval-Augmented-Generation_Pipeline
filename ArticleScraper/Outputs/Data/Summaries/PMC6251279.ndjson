{"summary": "Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a severe, often lethal zoonosis caused by the intracellular protozoa L. infantum. the presence of domestic dogs in endemic areas is a known risk factor for human infection. a single dose of plasmids encoding the two aforementioned L. longipalpis salivary proteins (LJM17 or LJL143) was followed by two booster doses of rCanarypoxvirus expressing one of the two aforementioned L. longipalpis salivary protein genes. a single dose of plasmids encoding the two antigens was followed by two booster doses of rCanarypoxvirus expressing animals were housed at the Experimentation Kennel facility in the region of Monte Gordo. all dogs received routine vaccinations and were dewormed. no dogs showed any detectable levels of antibodies against Leishmania, L. longipalpis saliva, Ehrlichia canis, Borrelia burgdorferi or Dirofilaria immitis. a randomized placebo-controlled study was performed using 30 beagle dogs randomly divided into two treatment groups. each group consisted of 10 dogs. an initial immunization was performed using 250 g of plasmid DNA encoding the L. longipalpis salivary protein LJM17 (pNBO002) or LJL143 (pNBO003) injected intramuscularly. leishmania parasites were isolated from a naturally infected dog. the experimental infection challenge employed a previously described protocol. canine cytokine magnetic bead panel was used to measure a variety of cytokines and chemokines (IFN-, IL-10, TNF, IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-15, IL-8, GM-CSF) the kit was used in accordance with the manufacturer protocol, as previously described (15). real-time PCR was performed to quantify parasite load as previously described. ear skin biopsies and aspiration punctures from bone marrow, popliteal lymph nodes and spleens were collected as previously described. no dogs showed any detectable levels of antibodies against Leishmania, L. longipalpis saliva, Ehrlichia canis, Borrelia burgdorferi, or Dirofilaria immitis. animals were kept under surveillance and received veterinary medical care, a balanced feed, water ad libitum, and were housed in covered kennels with stalls protected by thin netting. unization was performed using 250 g of plasmid DNA encoding the L. longipalpis salivary protein LJM17 (pNBO002) or LJL143 (pNBO003), injected intramuscularly. a second immunization containing 108 recombinant canarypoxvirus expressing the gene encoding LJL143 proteins (vCP2389) or LJM17 (vCP2390) was also administered by dogs were inoculated intradermally 30 days after the final immunization using a 29-gauge needle at a volume of 200 l in the right ear with 107 stationary-phase promastigotes. all dogs were housed in a kennel protected by anti-insect netting. levels of anti-Leishmania IgG antibodies were measured every 2 months until 10 months after infection by (ELISA) we measured cytokines and chemokines in the serum of immunized (T0) and infected dogs 2 and 4 months after infection (T1 and T2). ELISA evaluation of IFN- and IL-10 production was assessed by stimulation with LJM17 or LJL143 in the PBMCs of immunized and control dogs. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism v5.0 (GraphPad Software, USA) group comparisons were made considering levels of antibodies, parasite load, and cytokines using the non-parametric Mann Whitney U-test. sera collected at T0 (15 days after the last immunization) were used to detect total IgG (A) anti-LJM17 or (B) anti-LJL143 and (C) specific IgG1/IgG2 subclasses. PBMCs of immunized and control animals were stimulated with 4 g/mL of rLJM17 or rLJL143, and/or SGH of L. longipalpis immunization found that the groups immunized with salivary proteins presented higher levels of IFN- and IL-10 (Figures 1E,F; Supplementary Table 2). a pro-inflammatory response profile was observed, as evidenced by significantly higher IFN- production in the LJM17-immunized group (P 0.0002). an ELISA assay was performed to detect anti-Leishmania antibodies in canine sera at zero (T0), and every 2 months after infection. sera from the immunized and control animals were collected at T0 (15 days after immunization), and every 2 months until 10 months after infection. the dotted line represents the cutoff point obtained from sera of healthy dogs prior to infection. LJM17-immunized dogs present elevated IFN- in both canine sera and PBMCs. no differences were observed between the immunized and control dogs. sera from immunized and control animals were collected at T0, T1 and T2. PBMC IFN-, (B) PBMC IFN-, (D) PBMC IL-10, (D) sera IFN- AUC, (E) sera IL-10 AUC, (F) sera Luminex technique. significant differences in GM-CSF, IL-7 and CXCL1 were seen only in the LJL143-immunized group as compared to controls. no significant differences were detected with respect to IL-10 and chemokines IL-8 and CCL2 chemokines. the dogs immunized with either salivary protein presented higher levels of IFN-, IL-6, IL-18, GM-CSF, IL-7, IL-15, TNF, and CCL2 when compared to controls. both experimental groups exhibited decreased CXCL10 and IL-2 in comparison to T1 (Figure 4C). ELISA was performed to detect anti-LJM17 and LJL143 IgG, IgG1 and IgG2 subclasses in the sera of immunized and control dogs at baseline and T0 (15 days after the last immunization) the immunized groups showed significant production of specific antibodies against the two proteins (P 0.0001). PBMCs from immunized dogs stimulated with SGH or one of the recombinant proteins showed higher IFN- production compared to controls. no IL-10 production was observed in any of the experimental groups. a pro-inflammatory response profile was observed, as evidenced by significantly higher IFN-:IL-10 ratio. ELISA assay was performed to detect anti-Leishmania IgG in canine sera at zero (T0) and every 2 months after infection, anti-Leishmania antibodies had already been detected in all animals. at 4 months after infection antibody concentrations decreased and all animals exhibited negative serology. analysis was performed using the Kruskall-Wallis test with Dunns post-test. parasite load was assessed by real time PCR during the 10 months of follow up. only at 2 months after infection, no parasites were detected in any biological samples. PBMCs from immunized and control animals were collected at T0 (15 days after immunization), and every 2 months until 8 months after infection. sera from immunized and control animals were collected at T0, T1 and T2 to detect IFN- and IL-10 by the Luminex technique. chemokines were detected in immunized dog sera following infection. we measured the production of different cytokines (IFN, IL-10, IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-15, IL-18, and CCL2) in the sera of immunized and infected animals. immunoized and control animal sera were collected at T0 (15 days after immunization), T1 and T2 (2 and 4months after infection) to detect cytokines and chemokines in the sera. at T1, 2 months post-infection, the LM17- and LJL143-immunized dogs showed higher levels of IFN-, IL-6, IL-18, CXCL10, GM-CSF, IL-7, IL-15, and CCL2 immunization with LJL143 resulted in an immediate inflammatory response. the expression of most of these molecules was lower at 2 and 4 months after infection. control animals did not present any increases in the inflammatory molecules evaluated, even at T1 and T2. both LJM17 and LJL143-immunized dogs showed elevated production of specific IgG1 and IgG2. this indicates the induction of a mixed (Th1/Th2) immune response. cytokine production plays an essential role in the host inflammatory process. infected dogs showed higher levels of IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-15, IL-18, and TNF upon infectious challenge. increased levels of IL-2, TNF, and IFN- were detected in the sera of LJM17-immunized dogs. this suggests that immunization in presence of this salivary protein has the potential to improve protection of dogs against Leishmania infection. cytokines originating from myeloid cells, such as IL-15 and IL-18, have been associated with the activation of mature NK cells, which in turn produce IL-12 (32, 33) all of the immunized infected animals presented higher levels of GMCSF and CXCL10 when compared to controls. the role of GMCSF has been widely studied in the context of infection by several leishmania species (34, 35) intradermal, subcutaneous, intravenous, intraperitoneal, and intracardiac routes are often employed as inoculation routes for challenge strategies with Leishmania. each bite by a L. infantum-infected L. longipalpis sand fly can inject up to 104 parasites into host skin, along with immunogenic molecules. our results indicated that LJM17 induces a stronger and longer lasting immunity than LJL143 when compared to control dogs. however, protective efficacy of a vaccine containing the LJM17 antigen against CVL clinical disease remains to be further explored by exposure of immunized dogs. conflict of interest statement The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
