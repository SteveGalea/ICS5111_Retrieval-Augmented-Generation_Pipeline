{"summary": "the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV Coronaviruses of the genus Coronavirus can be divided into 3 antigenic groups. group 1 includes human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV). civet SARS-CoV-like virus Early human SARS-CoV Late human SARS-CoV Transmission Animal-to-animal Animal/human-to-human Outbreak No No/local Local/global Causes disease No Mild Severe Representative strains SZ3, SZ16 GD03T0013 Tor2, Urbani, BJ01, GZ02 Source Palm civets SARS patients during 2003\u20132004 epidemic. inactivated virus expresses several structural proteins, including nucleocapsid, membrane, envelope, and spike (S) proteins. recombinant RBD may be used as an efficacious and safe vaccine for preventing infection by SARS-CoV strains with distinct genotypes. the inactivated virus vaccine should be replaced by vaccines based on fragments containing neutralizing epitopes. the first inactivated virus vaccine is being tested in the clinical trials in china. safety of the inactivated vaccine is a serious concern. infection by SARS-CoV is initiated by binding of RBD in the viral S protein S1 subunit to ACE2 on target cells. this forms a fusogenic core between the HR1 and HR2 regions in the S2 domain that brings the viral and target cell membranes into close proximity. this scenario indicates that the S protein may be used as a vaccine to induce antibodies for blocking virus binding. immunization of green monkeys with attenuated parainfluenza virus resulted in production of neutralizing antibodies and protective responses in immunized animals. peptides spanning the entire sequence of the SARS-CoV S protein suggest that the S protein can induce neutralizing antibodies. the ACE2-binding domain mediates the antibody-dependent enhancement of civet SARS-CoV\u2013like virus entry (6). some antibodies to the ACE2-binding domain may enhance infection if these antibodies closely mimic the receptor ACE2. removal of the aa 1153\u20131194 region may abrogate induction of virus infection\u2013enhancing antibodies (6). van den Brink et al. identified 3 human neutralizing anti-S MAbs from antibody phage display libraries by using inactivated SARS-CoV as the target. these findings suggest that RBD contains the major neutralizing epitopes in the S protein and is an ideal SARS vaccine candidate. inactivated Vaccines SARS-CoV expresses several structural proteins. all may serve as antigens to induce neutralizing antibodies and protective responses. vaccine should be replaced by vaccines based on fragments containing neutralizing epitopes. a fragment located in the middle region of the S1 subunit (aa 318\u2013510) is the receptor-binding domain (RBD) for ACE2 (17\u201319) the cleavage site between these subunits has not been clearly defined. major and minor neutralizing epitopes are located in the S1 and S2 subunits, respectively. other groups also found neutralizing epitopes in the S2 subunit (27,28) antibodies against some immunodominant epitopes in the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein could neutralize infection by the relevant late SARS-CoV strains. however, these antibodies enhanced infection by an early human SARS-CoV isolate (GD03T0013) and the civet SARS-CoV\u2013like viruses. rabbits and mice immunized with RBD produced high titers of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV with 50% neutralizing titers at a >1:10,000 serum dilution (37). the antibodies purified from the antisera significantly inhibited RBD binding to ACE2 (9,36\u201338) 1 human MAb (CR3014) specific for RBD can effectively bind to most RBDs of the early and late SARS-CoV strains. recombinant proteins containing RBD or vectors encoding RBD may be used as vaccines for preventing infection by a broad spectrum of viral strains. safety is the major concern for this type of vaccine. recombinant RBD or vectors encoding RBD may be used as safe and efficacious vaccines for preventing infection by SARS-CoV with distinct genotypes."}
