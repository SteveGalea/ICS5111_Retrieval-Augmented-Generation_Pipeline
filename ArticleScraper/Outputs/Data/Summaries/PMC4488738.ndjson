{"summary": "viroporins are a class of small pore-forming proteins that have been shown to aid in multiple stages of the viral life cycle. viroporins have at least one trans-membrane domain (TMD) and sometimes an extracellular membrane region that interacts with viral or host proteins. IAV M2 97 Genome uncoating Glycoprotein processing/trafficking Delay protein trafficking through TGN Viral release [8,9,10,11,11,12,13,14,15,16] HIV-1 Vpu 77\u201386 Degradation of CD4 and trafficking of Env proteins Viral release [17,18,19,20,21,22,23] HCV P7 63 Viral morphogenesis Viral polyprotein processing [24,25,26 viroporins with three-pass TMD have been proposed. the non-structural protein 4 (NSP4) of rotavirus [49] and 3a of severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS-CoV [31] have been shown to be essential for the activation of the protein via protonation. class IIA viroporins have both the N- and C-termini in the lumenal side. class IIB have them facing the cytosol. a putative class III viroporin with three TMDs is depicted in this figure. viruses first have to bind to and penetrate the host plasma membrane to deliver the genetic elements into the cytoplasm for replication to take place. Upon binding of its hemagglutinin glycoprotein (HA) to the host surface sialic acid, IAV is internalized via the endosomal trafficking. fusion of the endosomal and viral membrane leads to the release of the nucleoprotein complex. VP2 and VP3 are proposed to be responsible for the escape of the virus into the cytosol as they are able to integrate into the ER membranes. mutant viruses lacking VP2 and VP3 pore-forming activities showed impaired viral infection [46] n channel activity prevents the acidification of the trans-Golgi, resulting in delay of protein trafficking through the TGN. the Vpu viroporin is only present in HIV-1 and absent from the type 2 HIV virus genome. the cytoplasmic domain of Vpu is responsible for the interaction with and degradation of CD4. poliovirus thwarts host immune response against viral infection by shutting off nascent MHC class I trafficking and down-regulating cytokine release. release of ER calcium into the cytosol can also trigger an immune response via the activation of inflammasomes as well as autophagy. viruses have evolved to hijack protective mechanisms to benefit their own replication. NSP4 is synthesized as an ER trans-membrane glycoprotein. it can also exist in secreted form as enterotoxin to induce diarrhea. the viroporin domain responsible for the increase of cytosolic Ca2+ is the viroporin domain from residue 47 to 90. viroporin appears to be encoded by the small envelope membrane (E) proteins [124,125,126]. conflicting results have been obtained for the structural determination of E protein in different coronaviruses. co-expression of the E protein and another membrane glycoprotein, M, were sufficient for the assembly and release of viral envelope particle. p7 has been shown to interact with three other structural proteins. mutations in the p7 cytoplasmic loop led to retention of core in the LD. p7 can also affect the processing of the viral polyprotein between E2/p7 and p7/NS2. a model has been proposed whereby 2B alters the permeability of the ER and plasma membrane to facilitate viral release by affecting the calcium content. VP4 of SV40 induces membrane perforation by forming toroidal pores, fusing outer and inner leaflets to initiate viral release. tion of this region resulted in a defect in viral release. a phenotypic beads-on-a-string budding pattern is seen due to incomplete scission. a second viroporin, 3a, was identified in SARS-CoV. the underlying molecular mechanism involved is yet to be determined. Vpu may be able to modulate the fate of other host proteins by hijacking the clathrin-dependent trafficking pathways. viruses first have to bind to and penetrate the host plasma membrane to deliver the genetic elements into the cytoplasm for replication to take place. a new inhibitor has been developed against M2 to antagonize its ion channel function in host cells. rimantadine is believed to bind and stabilize M2 in the closed conformation. the virus encodes up to three known pore forming proteins, VP2, VP3 and VP4, each of which is activated at a different stage of the life cycle. VP2 and VP3 are proposed to be responsible for the escape of the virus into the cytosol as they are able to integrate into the ER membranes. expression of M2 delayed its presentation at the cell surface. this could be prevented using a viroporin inhibitor, amantadine. the Vpu viroporin is only present in HIV-1 and absent from the type 2 HIV virus genome. a viroporins can inhibit the cellular protein secretion pathway by disassembling the Golgi complex or blocking the secretory pathway. poliovirus thwarts the host immune response against viral infection by shutting off the nascent MHC class I trafficking and down-regulating cytokine release. the viral protein responsible for the fluctuation of calcium store is the viroporin domain from residue 47 to 90. the enterotoxin form of NSP4 binds to integrins and activates calcium mobilization. the cytoplasmic tail of NSP4 can directly interact with the - and -tubulin. viroporin appears to be encoded by the small envelope membrane (E) proteins. in the family of Coronaviridae, viroporin appears to be encoded by the small envelope membrane (E) proteins [124,125,126] conflicting results have been obtained for the structural determination of E protein in different coronaviruses. p7 has been shown to interact with three other HCV structural proteins. a study by Gentzsch et al. showed that mutations in the p7 cytoplasmic loop led to retention of core in the LD and subsequent defects in virus production. p7 can also affect the processing of the viral polyprotein between E2/p7 and p7/NS2. a model has been proposed whereby 2B alters the permeability of the ER and plasma membrane to facilitate viral release by affecting the calcium content. VP4 of SV40 induces membrane perforation by fusing the outer and inner leaflets of the lipid bilayers to initiate viral release. a defect in the budding of infectious particles led to a defect in the budding of infectious particles. deletion of this region resulted in a defect in viral release. a phenotypic beads-on-a-string budding pattern is seen due to incomplete scission. a second viroporin, 3a, was identified in SARS-CoV. a crystal structure of a protein complex containing both Vpu-tetherin and the core of the clathrin adaptor protein complex 1 (AP1) was obtained recently. this opens up the possibility that Vpu may be able to modulate the fate of other host proteins by hijacking the clathrin-dependent trafficking pathways. a virus hijacks the host molecular machinery and turns it into a virus factory. viroporins from several viruses have been shown to trigger apoptosis in a caspase-dependent manner but the mechanism involved differs between each virus. the HIV-1 Vpu protein also induces apoptosis via both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. autophagy occurs through intracellular membrane trafficking system. cellular components are sequestered into a double-membrane vesicle called an autophagosome. degradation of the autophagosomes is inhibited, leading to accumulation of these vesicles in the infected cells. ic calcium concentration activates the calcium-dependent autophagy pathway. inflammasome is a caspase-activating complex that upon induction results in caspase-1 activation and pro-inflammatory cytokines secretion. hRSV SH viroporin also induces NLRP3 inflammasome activation. EMCV encodes a viroporin, 2B, similar to the poliovirus 2B viroporin. treatment with the calcium ion chelator BAPTA-AM completely inhibited the release of IL-1. 2B is solely responsible for EMCV-induced inflammasome activation. apoptosis prevents activation of NF-B and suppresses expression of several NF-B-dependent anti-apoptosis genes. RNA viruses include 6K of Sindbis virus, M2 of IAV, 2B and 3A of poliovirus, p7 of HCV, and E protein of mouse hepatitis virus A59. a cell death pathway that is often activated during an insult is autophagy. formation of autophagy-like double-membrane vesicles is induced by 2BC and 3A viral proteins [170,171,172] formation of autophagy-like double-membrane vesicles is induced by 2BC and 3A viral proteins. the 3A viroporin then further inhibits the movement of these vesicles along the microtubules. several respiratory viruses are known to activate NLRP3 inflammasome in the lung during infection by causing disturbances to the cellular potassium and calcium ion homeostasis via viroporins. the hRSV SH viroporin also induces NLRP3 inflammasome activation in a similar manner. the poliovirus 2B viroporin encodes a viroporin, 2B. the first inhibitory drug developed against adamantane compounds (amantadine or rimantadine) was used to treat influenza infections [188,189,190]. adamantane compounds (amantadine or rimantadine) has been found against other viruses. mutants, Pielak and colleagues were able to determine the mechanisms of inhibition of the M2 inhibitors as well as the mechanism of resistance conferred by the mutations. this information would be useful for the future development of viroporin inhibitors with improved binding and mechanism of inhibition."}
