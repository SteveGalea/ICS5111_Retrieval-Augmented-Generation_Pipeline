{"summary": "Background Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus (HeV) represent the highly pathogenic zoonotic agents in the paramyxovirus genus Henipavirus with human case fatality rates ranging between 40 and 75%. there are currently no vaccines or postexposure treatments licensed for combating human NiV infection. henipaviruses can be transmitted to many mammalian species including humans. there are two distinct strains of NiV: the Malaysia strain (NiVM) discovered in 1999 during an outbreak on pig farms. evidence suggests human to human transmission is possible [5]. sicular stomatitis virus vectors have been developed as vaccine candidates against many important human pathogens such as papillomavirus [15,16], human immunodeficiency virus [17-19], influenza virus [20], measles virus [21,22], respiratory syncytial virus [23,24], severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [25], chikungunya virus [26], and hemorrhagic fever viruses such as Lassa, rVSV-G-NiVB/F-GFP and rVSV-G-NiVB/G-GFP virus stocks were able to reach titers of up to 3 108 PFU/ml. rVSV-G-NiVB/F-GFP and rVSV-G-NiVB/G-GFP virus stocks were able to reach titers of up to 3 108 PFU/ml. group 1: rVSV-G-GFP expressing no glycoprotein; produces \u2018bald\u2019 virions, Group 2 GInd*rVSV-NiVB /F-GFP expressing the NiVB G protein (yellow); produces virions with G on the surface. group 4 made from co-infection in Vero cells resulting in combination of rVSV-NiVB /F-GFP and rVSV-NiVB /G-GF we were able to detect IgG directed at NiV F in sera of the Group 2 and 4 vaccinated cohorts 28 days after vaccination. animals in Group 3 had higher levels of circulating anti-NiV G IgG when compared to Group 4. animals in group 3 had higher levels of circulating anti-NiV G IgG when compared to Group 4. we challenged ferrets intranasally with a lethal challenge dose of NiVM. the specifically vaccinated animals in Groups 2-4 did not lose weight over the course of the study. clinical scores were recorded each day after challenge for each animal. varying severity of heavy, wet, diffusely mottled with dark pin point foci throughout the pulmonary parenchyma, multifocal pin point raised foci throughout the renal parenchyma. each animal had diffuse hemorrhagic interstitial pneumonia (Figure 4C) and splenomegaly with multifocal necrosis (Figure 4D, +) ++/6, ++/8 Thrombocytopenia (d8); Lymphopenia (d6,8); >3-fold increase in BUN (d8); hypoalbuminemia (d6,8); ecchymotic rash on ventral surface of neck; lungs with severe congestion and hemorrhage of all lobes; enlarged spleen; darkened liver. animal euthanized on d7. ++/6, ++/7 Thrombocytopenia (d7); Lymphopenia (d6-7); hypoalbuminemia (d7). lungs with severe congestion and hemorrhage of all lobes; enlarged spleen. ferrets in control group 1 also had detectable NiV antigen systemically. the endothelium, scattered mononuclear cells and syncytial cells (endothelial and epithelial) of the lung (Figure 5D), spleen (Figure 5H), kidney (Figure 5L) and brain (Figure 5P) had strong immunolabeling for NiV antigen. NiVM genome equivalents (GEq) were detected in all blood samples from day 6 p.c. none of the specifically vaccinated animals had any detectable NiVM RNA in terminal blood samples on day 21. ral load in ferrets as detected by genome equivalents (GEq) by qRT-PCR from (A) blood as GEq/ml and (B) from tissues a GEq/g. animal 4-1 was negative for NiVM antigen in spleen. circulating antibodies lacked neutralizing antibody titers before and after vaccination. antibody titers reduce virus infectivity are shown for all groups on the (A) day of vaccination showing a lack of neutralizing antibody for all groups except Group 1. on the terminal bleed days showing high levels of neutralizing antibodies for Groups 2-4 and low neutralizing antibodies for Group 1. the rVSV-G-NiVB/F-GFP and rVSV-G-NiVB/F-GFP virus stocks were able to reach titers of up to 3 108 PFU/ml. infection of Vero cells with these stocks resulted in syncytia formation. group 1 received GInd* rVSV-G-GFP; group 2 received GInd* rVSV-NiVB/F-GFP; group 3 received GInd* rVSV-NiVB/F-GFP; and group 4 received the rVSV-G-NiVB/F-GFP. as expected, we did not detect NiV F-specific Ig in sera before vaccination. animals in Groups 2-4 and not Group 1 generated humoral immune response to the rVSV-G-NiVB antigens delivered in a single injection. the animals were closely monitored over the course of 22 days post challenge (p.c.) for clinical signs of illness. each animal using a scoring system based on coat grooming, social behavior, and provoked behavior. the clinical scores for each animal correlated with the survival data as seen with the mean clinical score for each animal having no score on any day p.c. clinical description and outcome of Nipah virus challenged ferrets Group-subject no. Clinical illness a Viral b load Clinical and gross pathology 1-1 Fever (d5-7); depression (d6-7); lethargy (d6-7); loss of appetite (d6-7); labored breathing (d6-7). animal euthanized on d7. ecchymotic rash on ventral surface of neck; lungs with severe congestion and hemorrhage of all lobes; enlarged spleen; darkened liver. animals euthanized due to complications from NiV-induced disease. ferrets in control group 1 also had detectable NiV antigen systemically. ferrets in group 1 also had syncytial cells (endothelial and epithelial) of the lung. representative H&E stained tissues (A, C, E, G, I, K, M, and O) and immunohistochemistry of tissues labeled with a NiV N protein-specific polyclonal rabbit antibody (B, D, F, H, J, L, N, and P). none of the specifically vaccinated animals had any detectable NiVM RNA. NiVM RNA was also detected systemically in the tissues of all animals that succumbed to infection in control Group 1 and in the spleen of one animal from Group 4 on the study end date. however, no NiVM antigen was detected by immunohistochemistry, whereas NiVM RNA was not detected in the tissues of the remaining animals in Groups 2-4. overall, the level of detection of NiVM RNA in tissues and blood correlated with outcome gross pathology, and histology. animals from control group 1 did not have neutralizing antibody titers against NiVM. all ferrets from groups 2-4 had neutralizing antibodies against NiVM. all animals from terminal bleeds had lower neutralizing antibody titers against NiVM. the ferret model was chosen for the initial evaluation of our rVSV-G-NiVB-F/G-GFP vectors. these models recapitulate what is seen during human infection with severe respiratory and neurologic disease and a generalized vasculitis. the ferret model should be considered as the initial small animal screening model for vaccines against NiV. anti-NiV F or anti-NiV G IgGs did not produce significant neutralizing antibody titers against NiVM. animals in group 2 vaccinated with GInd* rVSV-G-NiVB/F-GFP generated anti-NiV F and anti-NiV G IgGs. ferrets in group 4 vaccinated with GInd* rVSV-G-NiVB/F-GFP generated rVSV-G-NiVB/G-GFP vaccinated ferrets have never detected cross-reactivity against NiVM F. cross-reactivity may be a single-cycle replicating vaccine observation. a preventive vaccine would be important for several populations. to date, this is the first study to show efficacy of a vaccine against NiV using a single administration in the ferret model. rVSV vaccine vectors (rVSV-G-NiVB/F-GFP and rVSV-G-GFP) were recovered using methods previously described. Vero cells were co-infected with G*rVSV-G-NiVB/F-GFP and G* rVSV-G-NiVB/G-GFP. supernatants were collected 24 h.p.i. and titered on BHK-21 cells. tainment at the UTMB at galveston approved by the UTMB Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) twenty female ferrets weighing 0.75-1 kg were housed in groups of 3 and 2 animals per vaccine group. animals were anesthetized with KAX and vaccinated with 1 107 PFU. 96-well filter plates were primed with PBS. test sera were diluted in PBS at 1:10 for pre vaccination time points. biotinylated goat anti-ferret IgG and streptavidin-phycoerythrin were also diluted. samples were assayed for mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) across at least a 100 bead region performed on the BioPlex-200 machine. 125 L of PBS was added to each well and incubated for 2 minutes. samples included right lung upper lobe, right lung middle lobe, right lung lower lobe, left lung middle lobe, liver, spleen, kidney, adrenal gland, pancreas, and brain (frontal cortex) all blood samples were inactivated in AVL viral lysis buffer, and tissue samples were homogenized and inactivated in RLT buffer prior to removal from the BSL-4 laboratory. all blood and serum samples were processed and analyzed immediately after collection. histopathology and immunohistochemistry Necropsy was performed on all subjects. NiV RNA was detected using the CFX96 detection system (Bio-Rad) in one-step probe qRT-PCR kits (Qiagen) with following cycle conditions: 50\u00b0C for 10 minutes, 95\u00b0C for 10 seconds, and 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 10 seconds and 59\u00b0C for 30 seconds. to create the GEq standard, RNA from NiV challenge stocks was extracted. rVSV-G-NiVB/F-GFP and rVSV-G-GFP were recovered using methods previously described. rVSVG viruses were propagated on BHK-21 cells transfected with 2 g of pCAGGS-GInd expressing the VSV glycoprotein (GInd) diluted 1:10 in Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) Reagent Water (LRW) per manufacturer\u2019s directions and endotoxin levels were tested in LAL Endosafe\u00ae-PTS cartridges as directed by the manufacturer. positive controls showed that the tests were valid. pfu of NiVM in 1 ml of DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich, MO) 28 days after vaccination. animals assessed daily for weight, respiration quality, blood collection. animals scoring 7 or greater were euthanized per IACUC protocol. 100 L of diluted test sera was added to each well and incubated. liquid was removed by vacuum and 100 L of strep-PE (1:1000) was added to each well. 125 L of PBS was added to each well and again incubated for 30 minutes. 100 l of blood was added to 600 l of AVL viral lysis buffer (Qiagen) for RNA extraction. tissues were homogenized in 600 l RNAlater (Qiagen) for 7 days. RNA was isolated from blood and swabs using the RNeasy minikit. mean corpuscular volumes and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentrations were analyzed from blood collected in miniCollect EDTA tubes (Greiner Bio One) using a Hemavet HV950FS instrument per manufacturer\u2019s instructions. blood and serum samples were processed and analyzed immediately after collection. non-immune rabbit IgG was used as a negative staining control. Detection of NiV load RNA was isolated from blood or tissues and analyzed using primers/probe targeting the N gene and intergenic region between N and P of NiV. KMV cloned, recovered, characterized, and propagated the vaccines. RWC carried out animal vaccination and infection studies, processed animal tissues and blood, and participated in manuscript preparation."}
