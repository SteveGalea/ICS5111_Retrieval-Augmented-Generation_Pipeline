{"summary": "viruses are highly efficient and typically encode proteins with multiple functions. well studied examples of viral manipulation of host systems include viral transcription factors that also regulate cellular gene expression. viral proteins that inactivate p53 to circumvent cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. the SUMO System Over the last 15 years, a new post-translational modification system has been defined that is enzymatically analogous to, but functionally distinct from the classical ubiquitin system. the human SUMO-1 gene encodes a 101 amino acid polypeptide with 50% relatedness to the S. cerevisiae SMT3 protein and 18% sequence relatedness to ubiquitin. SUMO proteases, the heterodimeric activating enzyme, and Ubc9 are all specific for SUMO usage and do not function with ubiquitin. transfer of SUMO to target proteins can occur directly from Ubc9, apparently without an absolute requirement for substrate-specific E3-type ligase enzymes that are necessary for ubiquitin addition. the existence of multiple mammalian desumoylating enzymes suggests that sumoylation is likely to be a complex process that contributes to the regulation of activity of SUMO substrates. more recently, significant non-nuclear functions of sumoylation have been identified in regulation of ion channel activity [41,42] and metabolic pathways. innate response is triggered by recognition of pathogen-specific molecules by the Toll-like receptor (TLR) system. the activated IRFs turn on interferon transcription. innate response is triggered by recognition of pathogen-specific molecules. sumoylation of both murine IRF3 and IRF7 in response to viral infection has been reported. a subsequent study examining endogenous human IRF3 came to the opposite conclusion. sumoylation of human IRF3 competed with ubiquitination. there are not yet examples of viruses specifically targeting the sumoylation of TLRs or their signaling pathways. several viruses can alter global cellular sumoylation. intrinsic immunity operates through pre-existing proteins that act to repress viral infection. PML has anti-viral activity against both DNA and some RNA viruses. a large number of viruses specifically target PML NBs for disruption and/or degradation. abrogation of this viral function typically impairs viral reproduction. SUMO1 and SUMO2/3 could serve as the platform for SIM binding. ubc9 knockdown also results in greatly enhanced replication of the ICP0 null mutant. sumoylated proteins assemble on the viral genomes and serve as signal to recruit PML and other SIM containing NB proteins to viral replication complexes. SUMO moieties are critical signals that mediate localization of ICP0 to the viral genomes in order to counteract the repressive effect of PML and NB proteins. the role of SIM motifs for targeting these proteins has not been reported; further discussion of NB disruption can be found in section 4.4. sumoylation appears to be a highly important component of viral strategies for overcoming host defenses early in infection. pathogens could mimic or co-opt any step in the sumoylation process in order to alter the sumoylation status of viral or host proteins. there are now excellent examples for many steps in the sumoylation pathway. Xanthomonas campestris uses a type III secretion system to inject effector proteins into host cells during infection. XopD resembles the yeast SUMO protease, Ulp1, can deconjugate SUMO from substrates in vitro and in vivo. a second Xanthomonas protein, AvrXv4, causes desumoylation in plants. K-bZIP acts as a SUMO2/3-specific SUMO ligase that enhances sumoylation of its binding partners, including p53 and pRB. the adenovirus E1B-55K protein appears to be a SUMO1-specific SUMO ligase. -55K is itself sumoylated at lysine 104. mutation also impaired E1B-55K association with PML NBs. also demonstrated that sumoylation of p53 reduced its intracellular mobility. the discrepancy between the two-hybrid and pull-down assay results was not resolved. together they support the interpretation that ICP0 may make interactions with all the SUMO isoform. ICP0 can specifically ubiquitinate poly-SUMO chains in vitro. adenovirus adenovirus is critical for CELO replication [81]. it was quickly shown that GAM1 expression decreased sumoylation of the HDAC1 histone deacetylase. a subsequent study revealed that GAM1 expression leads to a dramatic decrease in total SUMO conjugated products in the cell, that GAM1 binds the SAE1/2 SUMO activation enzyme. the HPV E6 binds the PIASy SUMO ligase to inhibit sumoylation of PIASy substrates. the inhibition of activity was restricted to the high risk HPV 16 E6 protein and was absent in the low risk HPV11 E6 protein. the ability of the 16E6 protein to overcome PIASy induced senescence was not dependent upon p53. lysine 406 mutant suggests VP35 is causing promiscuous sumoylation of this target to ensure its transcriptional repression. pathogen proteins affecting Ubc9 are more numerous, suggesting that Ubc9 is a very effective cellular target for manipulating sumoylation. reducing intracellular Ubc9 levels with no effect on SAE was observed in an infected mouse model. an aspartyl protease inhibitor partially restored Ubc9 levels in the presence of LLO, suggesting that LLO may be acting through a cellular protease that can target Ubc9. E6 targets two sumoylation enzymes, Ubc9 and PIASy. it suggests modulation of sumoylation is important to the viral life cycle. however, it is possible that both up and down regulation of sumoylation are required at different stages of the viral cycle. a similar global increase in sumoylation was observed during influenza A virus infection of HEK293, A549, MDCK, and Vero cells. the viral target that causes this increase in sumoylation is unknown. however, the increase in sumoylation could not be mimicked by interferon treatment alone. SUMO binding by Ubc9 is critical for formation of SUMO chains (poly-sumoylation) wild type E1A is able to restore efficient growth while a Ubc9 non-binding mutant cannot. authors conclude that while E1A does not appear to grossly alter the mono-sumoylation pattern that it can inhibit poly-sumoylation which may affect the function of specific host proteins. pathogens and pathogen proteins targeted sumoylation enzymes to cause broad effects on multiple host SUMO substrates. target proteins identified to date include critical host cell regulators of growth or pathogen resistance. pathogens have developed strategies to dysregulate these proteins through modulation of their sumoylation status. sumoylation of pRB decreases its repressive activity on an E2F driven promoter. p53 is another cellular tumor suppressor that can elicit cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to infection. p53 is a primary target for many viral proteins that seek to limit p53\u2019s functions. phosphorylation of serine 824 reduces sumoylation at all three lysines. the viral kinase could phosphorylate KAP-1 leading to decreased KAP-1 sumoylation. many viruses have developed mechanisms to disrupt sumoylation of PML. a lysine 12 mutant of BZLF is impaired in dispersing PML bodies. the herpes simplex ICP0 protein appears to be a SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase. unlike ICP0, the varicella zoster virus ORF61 protein also possesses SIM motifs. SUMO2/3 modification of PML is known to promote degradation of PML due to ubiquitination by the cellular RNF4 ubiquitin ligase [111] suggesting that this may be the pathway triggered by LANA2 expression. a subsequent study found that LANA2 is sumoylated preferentially by SUMO2 and that a sumoylation deficient mutant of LANA2 was impaired for NB disruption. a study by sourvinos et al. found that targeting of IE2 to NBs was via association with viral genomes. some of these proteins use SIM motifs to facilitate their interaction with sumoylated PML. some of these proteins affect the sumoylation status of PML to promote dissemble of the NBs. pp71 did not interact with Ubc9 so it is unclear if pp71 is acting as a SUMO ligase for Daxx or stimulating Daxx sumoylation. pp71 could still induce degradation of a Daxx SUMO site mutant so sumoylation is not required for that activity. XopD is a virulence factor in tomatoes. a second Xanthomonas protein, AvrXv4, resembles a cysteine protease. but in vitro SUMO protease activity by AvrXv4 could not be demonstrated. the adenovirus E1B-55K protein appears to be a SUMO1-specific SUMO ligase. it was reported that E1B-55K enhanced p53 sumoylation in vivo. however, a subsequent study showed both in vivo and in vitro enhancement of p53 sumoylation confirming that E1B-55K is itself SUMO ligase. pathogen proteins that act as STUbLs are a group of ubiquitin ligases that contain SIM motifs that target the ligases to sumoylated proteins. in yeast two-hybrid assays ICP0 interacts in a SLS-4 dependent manner with SUMO2/3 but not SUMO1. expression of ICP0 in a stable cell line resulted in a decrease in global SUMO conjugates, including sumoylated forms of PML. this activity was reduced though not entirely eliminated in an SLS-4 mutant. a large number of pathogen proteins have been shown to target the sumoylation system in order to modulate overall sumoylation levels in the host cell. AM1 binds the cullin proteins, Cul2 and Cul5, and recruits the Cul2/5-EloB/C-Roc1 ubiquitin ligase complexes to SAE1/2. invitro the recruitment of the ubiquitin ligase causes enhanced ubiquitination of SAE1 and implicating ubiquitin mediated proteasomal degradation. the net result of GAM1 action on SAE1 is dramatic reduction in levels of the ability of the 16E6 protein to inhibit sumoylation-promoted induction of senescence through the pRB pathway would be of value for viral infection and possibly transformation. PIAS1 is an endogenous SUMO ligase for IRF7. VP35 was found complexed to both PIAS1 and IRF7. most sumoylated proteins, including pathogen proteins, interact with Ubc9 as part of the sumoylation process. however, the focus in this section will only be on interactions that alter or potentially alter Ubc9 function. both scenarios apparently can provide benefit in a pathogen-specific manner. protease inhibitor partially restored Ubc9 levels in the presence of LLO. toxins from Clostridium perfringens and Streptococcus pneumonia also reduced Ubc9 levels. high risk HPV E6 proteins, 16E6 and 18E6, also reduced both intracellular Ubc9 levels and overall sumoylation. LMP1 oncoprotein targets Ubc9 and causes enhanced global sumoylation. it is possible that both up and down regulation of sumoylation are required at different stages of the viral cycle. EBV showed that LMP1 binds Ubc9 through CTAR3. an intriguing but more limited viral effect on Ubc9 has recently been reported for the adenovirus E1A oncoprotein. the interaction motif on E1A is the sequence EVIDLT in the conserved region 2 (CR2) domain. however, sumoylation of Ubc9 was not required for the interaction with E1A. a specific viral protein mediator has not yet been established. it is worth mentioning another example by which host sumoylation could be perturbed. pathogens have evolved diverse mechanisms to target Ubc9. pRB is a tumor suppressor that inhibits cell cycle progression by blocking E2F activity until phosphorylation of pRB releases E2F. p53 is another cellular tumor suppressor that can elicit both cell cycle progression by blocking E2F activity. the adenovirus E1B-55K protein is a SUMO ligase that specifically targets p53 and enhances its sumoylation with SUMO1 [74] this viral enhanced sumoylation contributes to p53 localization and tethering in PML NBs. this clearly constitutes viral hijacking of the sumoylation system to suppress the activity of a host defense protein. many viruses have developed mechanisms to disrupt sumoylation of PML. this is a prominent feature of the herpesvirus family. a lysine 12 mutant of BZLF is impaired in dispersing PML bodies. ICP0 contains SIM motifs that direct it to PML. the ubiquitin ligase activity conjugates ubiquitin to PML. the ORF61 protein is not sufficient to degrade PML. the precise mechanism for PML dispersal remains uncertain. the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) has two early proteins, IE1 and IE2, that are both localized to PML NBs. IE1 induces disruption of NBs without degradation of PML [112], but with the loss of sumoylated forms of PML [113,114]. however, IE1 has no SUMO protease activity in vitro. a cytomegalovirus tegument protein, pp71, enhances sumoylation of Daxx. pp71 does not lead to a general increase in cellular sumoylation. a cytomegalovirus tegument protein, pp71, enhances sumoylation of Daxx. viruses have evolved strategies to dysregulate host cell proteins through modulation of their post-translational modification with the SUMO paralogs. this has been most thoroughly explored for PML and related NB proteins that have anti-viral activity, but clearly occurs for other important cellular regulatory proteins such as p53 and pRB. global changes in sumoylation induced by pathogens are more dramatic. some pathogen proteins act by mimicking sumoylation enzymes. others function by binding to and altering the activity of the endogenous host sumoylation enzymes."}
