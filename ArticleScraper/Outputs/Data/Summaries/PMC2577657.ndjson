{"summary": "Background Tuberculosis (TB) detection under the national TB control program in china follows passive case-finding guidelines. one intriguing topic is the correlation between men and women's knowledge on TB and their health-care seeking behaviors. china has the world's second largest number of TB cases. the progress in TB control was slow during the 1990s, resulting in the detection rate stagnating around 30%, far below the target set by the world health organization. studies have proved that lack of knowledge to TB is likely to hinder positive health-care seeking behavior while better knowledgeable on TB was significantly related to health-care seeking action. gender disparity is focused world-wide as higher notification rates of TB among men than women have been observed in many countries. study was conducted in YZ County, an island locating on the middle of Yangtze River in the southeast part of china. the county TB dispensary is affiliated to CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention), which was formerly called Anti-Epidemic Station. 'free' means no charges for sputum smear test, chest X-ray examination and anti-tuberculosis medications are not available in these facilities. questionnaire referred to questionnaire designed by china CDC. a stratified cluster sampling method was used to select sample units for TB screening. 20 villages were randomly sampled from 5 towns. seeking behaviors included buying drugs in pharmacies and visiting private practitioner, village health workers, physicians in town, county or upper level hospitals and the County TB Dispensary. 'free' means no charges for sputum smear test, chest X-ray examination and anti-tuberculosis medications distributed by government. 'free' means no charges for sputum smear test and chest X-ray examination. two cross-sectional studies were conducted in the study site. knowledge on TB among general population Sampling strategy followed the guidelines designed by china CDC. at the third stage, 100 households were systematically sampled from each village based on householders' names. 'system delay' refers to the time between the first utilization of a health provider and a confirmed diagnosis of TB. the study followed the guidelines designed by china CDC. 2 towns were selected at the first stage by using a systematic sampling technique. at the third stage, 100 households were systematically sampled from each village based on the list of householders' names. 'system delay' refers to the time between the first onset of symptoms and first utilization of a healthcare provider.'system delay' refers to the time between the first utilization of a health provider and a confirmed diagnosis of TB [7]. about 15.6% of them actively acquired information about TB. 13.1% of them shared it with others on their own initiatives. more men than women actively learned knowledge about TB. don't know 44(4.1) 20(4.0) 24(4.1) No 11(1.0) 9(1.8) 2(0.3) Severe 250(23.1) 113(22.5) 137(23.6) Very severe 778(71.8) 360(71.7) 418(71.9) 4.

Do you believe TB is a curable disease? the median of delay from the onset of symptoms to the first visit at health facility was 10 days. there was no gender disparity on the patient delay among TB suspects. 153 TB suspects were further rechecked. the proportion of men and women were 46.4% and 53.6% respectively, with the average age of 43.1 12.9 years. the median annual income per capita was around 4000 CNY (Chinese Yuan) only 73.6% (men 78.5% vs. women 69.4%) believed TB was a curable disease at the present time. don't know 55(5.1) 22(4.4) 33(5.7) 15(3.0) 16(2.8) Yes 997(92.1) 465(92.6) 532(91.6) 3.

Is it free for TB diagnosis in your county\" 190 subjects were notified with a prolonged cough within the past three months. 67.3% of them had sought for health-care during the current cough episode. 59.6% of them firstly visited village clinics or drugstores after the onset of cough. there was no gender disparity on the patient delay among TB suspects. 128 (74.9%; men/women: 74.7%/75.0%) traveled to CDC for free chest X-ray examination. 8 (7 men and 1 woman) were ultimately diagnosed with pulmonary TB. in rural areas, the lowest level of TB control system is the county TB dispensary where patients with cough and/or other TB symptoms do not routinely visit. the accessibility of DOTS in china relies on referral by doctors in general hospitals, and/or self-referral by patients. sputum smear test, chest X-ray and anti-tuberculosis medicines. a compromise to the vertical TB control system. if patients know TB diagnosis and treatment should be free, they would have more chances to ask why they should pay for TB care and what cost should be covered by the free care. only 16% knew that cough lasting for more than 3 weeks was a suspicious symptom for TB. less than half knew the free policy for TB diagnosis and treatment. gender disparity of knowledge towards TB among men and women inconsistent with health-care seeking behaviors. women were more likely to seek health-care for TB suspicious symptoms. this may not help shorten the health system delay due to the weakness in diagnosis in non-formal health facilities. one might be the deficient knowledge on TB. another might be the special role of women in china. women are more likely to seek health-care after the onset of prolonged cough. women usually visit village clinics or drugstores while men prefer to seek health-care in upper level hospitals."}
