{"summary": "human infections caused by avian-origin H7N9 IAVs have been reported in china. human infections with H7N9 IAVs have a high mortality rate. avian IAVs generally prefer binding to 2,3-linked sialosides. human viruses preferentially bind to glycans containing 2,6-linked SIAs. the novel H7 protein prefers binding to avian-type receptors (2,3-linked sialosides) the NA proteins of several avian IAVs (N1, N2, and N9) have been shown to display hemadsorption activity (23\u201326), which was attributed to the presence of a 2nd SIA-binding site. X-ray crystallography (27) revealed that the 2nd SIA-binding site is a shallow pocket composed of three surface peptide loops located adjacent to the catalytic site. previously, we compared the HA receptor-binding properties of a human isolate of the novel H7N9 virus isolated in 2013 with those of a closely related avian H7N9 virus from 2008. the H7 of the novel H7N9 virus displayed modestly increased binding to 2,6 sialosides and reduced, but still dominant, binding to 2,3-linked SIAs compared to the H7N9 virus from 2008 (15). mutations in the 2nd SIA-binding site may have enabled the acquisition of altered receptor-binding properties of HA. previously, we compared the HA receptor-binding properties of a novel H7N9 virus isolated from a human patient in 2013 with those of a closely related avian virus from 2008. the resulting proteins (referred to as TE-N9) displayed the expected electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 1B) and higher specific activity than the GCN4-N9 proteins (Fig. 1C). specific activities for MUNANA were similar for the N9 Anhui and Spain proteins. TE-N9 proteins on multivalent, surface-coated fetuin and transferrin glycoprotein substrates better resemble the multivalent in vivo substrates of NA. transferrin contains two biantennary N-linked glycan chains with only 2,6-linked SIAs. the resulting cleavage of SIAs was quantified by probing the 96-well plates with lectins with different binding specificities. both TE-N9 proteins displayed higher specific activity when fetuin was used as a substrate than with transferrin. this substrate preference corresponds to both proteins preferring cleavage of 2,3-linked (determined with fetuin-MAL I) over 2,6-linked (determined with fetuin-SNA and transferrin-SNA) SIAs. specific activity of TE-N9 Spain as determined by ELLA using different glycoprotein-lectin combinations normalized to that of fetuin-ECA. specific activity of TE-N9 Anhui as determined by ELLA using different glycoprotein-lectin combinations normalized to that of fetuin-ECA. ELLA using fetuin (E) or transferrin (F) in combination with ECA normalized to that of TE-N9 Spain. the results of three or four independent experiments performed in duplicate/triplicate are shown for the ELLA. standard deviations are indicated. the binding specificities of the N9 proteins were studied in a hemagglutination assay. the N9 span protein displayed efficient binding to a large number of 2,3-linked sialosides and weak or no binding to 2,6-linked sialosides. glycan array analysis of binding specificities of N9 Spain (A) and Anhui (B) in the presence of 1 M OsC. binding to nonsialylated glycans was evaluated. two residues are located in the NA stalk domain. another 6 residues are located in the NA head domain. the 5-amino-acid NA stalk deletion observed in N9 Anhui is indicated by the green rectangle. Thr401 in the 2nd SIA-binding site is important for binding to and cleavage of multivalent substrates. mutant and wild-type proteins subjected to different binding assays. mutations abolished (Spain-T401A) or established (Anhui-A401T) binding of the N9 proteins. fetuin-binding (A), hemagglutination (B) and glycan array (C and D) assays in presence of 1 M OsC is shown. only binding to nonsialylated (glycans 1 to 10) and 2,3-SIA (glycans11 to 79) glycans is shown. the T401A mutation preceded a small, 5-amino-acid deletion in the stalk, which has been described previously as being characteristic of the novel H7N9 viruses (41) the phylogenetic analyses indicate that only after the acquisition of these NA mutations are the substitutions in H7 at positions 186 and 226, which are associated with the altered receptor-binding properties of these viruses (15), observed.

TE-N9 proteins displaying the highest specific activity were used in all subsequent analyses. transferrin contains two biantennary N-linked glycan chains with only 2,6-linked SIAs (34, 35), which was confirmed by linkage-type-specific enzyme-linked lectin-binding assays (ELLA) both TE-N9 proteins displayed higher specific activity when fetuin was used as a substrate. potential fine specificity was investigated in detail by assessing cleavage of SIA from a large number of sialylated glycans on a glycan array. both TE-N9 proteins prefer cleavage of 2,3- over 2,6-linked sialosides. TE-N9 Anhui protein indeed had higher specific activity than the TE-N9 Anhui protein. glycan array analysis of the cleavage specificities of TE-N9 Spain (C) and Anhui (D) was detected by ECA binding. the colors of the bars correspond to the types of SIA. Mutations in the 2nd SIA-binding site of N2 were previously shown to affect the catalytic efficiency of NA against multivalent, but not monovalent substrates. differences in specific activities for multivalent substrates of the two N9 proteins may therefore be caused by differences in their abilities to bind to multivalent substrates. glycan structures lacking SIAs did not bind (Fig. 4A; see Table S1 in the supplemental material) no binding was observed for the N9 Anhui protein (Fig. 4B; see Table S1 in the supplemental material). sequence alignment showed that the Anhui and Spain N9 proteins differ at only 8 amino acid positions, in addition to a small deletion of 5 amino acids in the stalk. Thr401 (N2 numbering) is part of a loop that forms an H bond via Asn400 with SIA bound to the 2nd SIA-binding site (Fig. 5B to D) crystal structure of N9 from A/tern/Australia/G70C/75 in complex with Neu5Ac (PDB accession no. 1MWE) (27) depicted using PyMol software. the NA active site (6) and the residues in the 2nd SIA-binding site that have direct interaction with SIA (27) are colored red and blue, respectively. mutant and wild-type proteins subjected to different binding assays. mutant and wild-type proteins either abolished (Spain-T401A) or established (Anhui-A401T) binding of the N9 proteins to fetuin. hemagglutination (B), and glycan array (C and D) assays in presence of 1 M OsC. only binding to nonsialylated (glycans 1 to 10) and 2,3-SIA (glycans11 to 79) glycans is shown. an H7 protein tree was constructed as described in Materials and Methods. key residues that differ between different branches are indicated. the mutation at position 401 and the deletion in the stalk are boxed in green. hai/JS01/2013 A G Q A/Shanghai/1/2013 A + G Q A/chicken/Zheijang/SD007/2013 A + V Q A/pigeon/Wuxi/0405007/2013 A + V Q A/environment/Guangdong/30/2013 A + V Q A/Bejing/1/2013 A + V L A/environment/Guangdong/25/2013 A + V L A/Anhui a single T401A mutation in the 2nd SIA-binding site of novel H7N9 viruses appears to functionally mimic the substitutions found in the 2nd SIA-binding site of NA proteins of IAVs that managed to cross the host species barrier to become human viruses. the presence of a 2nd SIA-binding site in NA was already demonstrated in the 1980s. the biological function of the NA 2nd SIA-binding site has long remained elusive. only a single study showed that the ability of NA to bind red blood cells corresponded to the cleavage efficiencies of other multivalent substrates. the 2nd SIA-binding site may enhance catalytic efficiency against the same substrate. mutations in the 2nd SIA-binding site may also be observed for avian IAVs. the decreased ability of the N9 protein of novel H7N9 IAV to bind and cleave sialosides correlate well with the low receptor-binding avidity of the corresponding HA protein (15). genes, expression vectors, and protein expression and purification have been described. sequences encoding the NA head domain (amino acids 76 to 470) of N9 Anhui and N9 Spain were preceded by sequences encoding a CD5 N-terminal signal sequence, a double Strep tag for purification and a GCN4-pLI (47) tetramerization domain. etrabrachion tetramerization domain (31, 48) (referred to as TE-NA) mutants of interest were introduced into the corresponding NA genes. HA and NA expression plasmids were transfected into HEK293T cells. recombinant soluble NA or HA proteins were purified from the cell culture supernatants. the binding of ECA, PNA, SNA, and MAL I was detected using horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated streptavidin and tetramethylbenzidine substrate (TMB) in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (EL-808; BioTek) reading the optical density (OD) at 450 nm. the data were fitted by nonlinear regression using Prism 6.05 software (GraphPad) the binding abilities of HA and N9 proteins were analyzed using fetuin solid-phase binding and hemagglutination assays. the binding abilities of HA and N9 proteins were analyzed using fetuin solid-phase binding and hemagglutination assays similarly to what was described previously (40, 51). the binding and hemagglutination assays were performed at least twice in duplicate. glycan array values shown are the means and standard errors of 6 glycan spot intensities. sequences encoding the NA head domain (amino acids 76 to 470) of N9 Anhui and N9 Spain were preceded by sequences encoding a CD5 N-terminal signal sequence, a double Strep tag for purification and a GCN4-pLI (47) tetramerization domain (referred to as GCN4-NAhead) 96-well Nunc MaxiSorp plates were incubated with either biotinylated ECA (1.25 g/ml; Vector Laboratories), biotinylated PNA (1.25 g/ml; Galab Technologies), biotinylated SNA (1.25 g/ml; Vector Laboratories), or biotinylated MAL I (2.5 g/ml; Vector Laboratories) etramethylbenzidine substrate (TMB) in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (EL-808; BioTek) reading the optical density (OD) at 450 nm. the data were fitted by nonlinear regression using Prism 6.05 software. the mean values of 2 to 4 experiments, with independently generated protein preparations, were graphed. dilutions on fetuin-coated (50 g/ml) or asialofetuin-coated (50 g/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) 96-well Nunc MaxiSorp plates at 4\u00b0C for 2 h.
