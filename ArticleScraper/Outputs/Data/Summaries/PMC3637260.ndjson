{"summary": "mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common human respiratory tract pathogen. it causes 6\u201330% of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) cases in adults all over the world. clinical and laboratory manifestations do not differentiate between pneumonia caused by typical or atypical pathogens [4,5] and the commonly described -lactams are not effective because M. pneumoniae lacks a cell wall. paired sera showing a fourfold increase in IgG antibody titer has been considered as a more reliable method for the diagnosis of current M. pneumoniae infection. adults and adolescent patients with radiographically confirmed CAP were enrolled consecutively. from October 2010 to September 2011, adults and adolescent patients (14 years of age) with radiographically confirmed CAP were enrolled consecutively. DNA was extracted from 200 l of throat swab sample by manual nucleic acid extraction (Qiagen QIAmp DNA Mini Kit, Valencia, CA) the results were displayed as qualitative. the etiology was considered definite if one of the following criteria was met. the etiology was considered definite if one of the following criteria was met. a prospective study was conducted in 12 teaching hospitals. from October 2010 to September 2011, adults and adolescent patients with radiographically confirmed CAP were enrolled consecutively. from October 2010 to September 2011, adults and adolescent patients with radiographically confirmed CAP were enrolled consecutively. DNA was extracted from 200 l of throat swab sample by manual nucleic acid extraction (Qiagen QIAmp DNA Mini Kit, Valencia, CA) the results were displayed as qualitative. the etiology was considered definite if one of the following criteria was met: (1) positive bacterial culture; (2) positive urinary antigen for L pneumophila. detection of respiratory viruses by RT-PCR using a Seeplex RV Detection Kit. acute M. pneumoniae infection was diagnosed in 27/125 (median 47 years) patients showed a fourfold or greater increase in IgG antibody titer of paired sera. twenty-three patients had causative pathogens other than M. pneumoniae. 0.58 39.22 0.57 39 0.58 0.113 Cough 114 (91.2) 27 (100.00) 87 (88.78) 0.119 Sputum production 83 (66.4) 20 (74.07) 60 (61.22) 0.37 Dyspnea 22 (17.6) 7 (25.93) 15 (15.31) 0.253 Chest pain 17 (13.6) 4 (14.81) 13 (13.27) 0.761 Digestive symptoms 11 (8.8) 5 (18.52) 6 (6.12) 0.052 78 0.841 Antibiotic usage before admission within 1 week 77 (61.6) 18 (66.67) 59 (60.2) 0.657 Site of care (n = 125) 0.667 Outpatient 51 (40.8) 10 (37.04) 41 (41.84) Hospitalization 74 (59.2) 17 (62.96) 57 (58.16) Duration of hospitalization (days) 14 (10\u201318) 13 (6.5-19) 14 (11\u201318) 0.549 Days after onset at the IgM testing 4 (1\u2013 eight patients showed a fourfold or greater increase in IgG titers. four were positive by both FQ-PCR and culture. one was positive by culture and IgM test, one was positive by culture and IgM test. PPV and PLR were lowest in IgM antibody testing (7.4%, 28.6% and 1.45 respectively), intermediate in FQ-PCR (40.7%, 50% and 3.63 respectively), and highest in culture (55.6%, 75% and 10.9 respectively). sensitivity of the IgM assay was 33.3% in diagnosis of acute M. pneumoniae infection in adult CAP patients. sensitivity of culture from respiratory specimens has turned out to be as low as 61.5% [19] compared with PCR, the sensitivity of culture from respiratory specimens has turned out to be as low as 61.5%. compared with PCR, culture was unacceptably insensitive for diagnosing M. pneumoniae infection. four patients (one positive by FQ-PCR and culture, and three positive by FQ-PCR or culture and IgM test) showed 2.5\u20133.8 fold increase of IgG response, which could be explained by an inadequate time interval. the remaining three patients (only positive by FQ-PCR) were 69, 73 and 74 years old. as the diagnosis for M. pneumoniae pneumonia, the sensitivity decreased to 61.9% and specificity increased to 74.7%. the limitations of the study included: 1) because of cost consideration, we evaluated only one FQ-PCR kit approved by state food and drug administration of china; and 2) in patients who had received antibiotics, the positive rates of culture and FQ-PCR may have been decreased. this work was supported by Beijing Science and Technology Project (D101100049810002) for Dr. Wang C, New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET-10-0006) for Dr. Cao B."}
