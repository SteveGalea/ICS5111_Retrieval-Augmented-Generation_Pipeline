{"summary": "enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection activates autophagy, which promotes viral replication in vitro and in vivo. the effects of autophagy on EV71-related pathogenesis and viral load were evaluated after intracranial inoculation of mouse-adapted EV71. 4 infected mice, including body weight loss, disease symptoms, and mortality, were increased compared to those of the uninfected mice. we further blocked EV71-induced autophagy with the inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA), which attenuated the disease symptoms and decreased the viral load in the brain tissues. EV71 is a non-enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Enterovirus genus. autophagy is a biological process involving the degradation of aggregated proteins and damaged organelles to maintain homeostasis. autophagosome fuses with endosome to form autolysosome. autophagosome may fuse with endosome to form vesicle known as amphisome. poliovirus, rhinovirus, coronavirus, Epstein-Barr virus, dengue virus, hepatitis C virus, HIV, coxsackievirus B3 and EV71 induce autophagic activity [29]\u2013[36]. Virus-mediated autophagy may enhance viral replication or evade immune surveillance [37]. the EV71 strain 4643 was isolated from a patient in Taiwan. the mouse-adapted strain MP4 was provided by Dr. Chun-Keung Yu. the virus was titrated in RD cells by plaque assay. cells were immersed with SuperBlock\u00ae Blocking Buffer in PBS for 1 hr at RT. after incubation, cells were washed with PBS six times per 10 min. then incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies for 1 hr at RT. the samples were investigated under a confocal microscope.

LC3 puncta (Green, a marker of autophagosome) abundantly colocalized with the EV71 structural protein VP1 and nonstructural protein 2C. the EV71 VP1 and 2C proteins colocalized with the MPR protein (Mannose-6-phosphate receptor, a marker of late endosome) the cells were treated with anti-LC3 rabbit polyclonal antibody and either anti-EV71 2C rat polyclonal antibody or anti-EV71 VP1 mouse monoclonal antibody. the cells with or without EV71 infection were then treated with LC3 mouse monoclonal antibody and EV71 2C mouse monoclonal antibody. autophagic flux was induced in EV71-infected SK-N-SH cells. SK-N-SH cells were infected with EV71 for various times at MOI of 10. expression levels of LC3-II were increased as compared to levels in the EV71-infected group without NH4Cl treatment. EV71 infection of the ICR suckling mice caused physiopathological changes and mortality. we previously reported that dengue virus type 2 and mouse-adapted EV71 (MP4 strain) infection induce autophagy in the brain tissues of ICR mice [36],[38] to further clarify the effect of EV71 infection-induced autophagy on pathogenesis as well as viral titer. seven-day-old ICR suckling mice were inoculated with the EV71 mouse-adapted strain MP4 (5 105 PFU/mouse) expression of EV71 VP1 in the brain tissues of control and suckling mice at day 2 p.i. was detected by immunohistochemical staining using anti-VP1 antibody. fected brain tissues were investigated by immunofluorescence staining under confocal microscopy. LC3 puncta, which represent autophagosomes, were colocalized with EV71 VP1 protein in the brain tissues of EV71-infected mice at 24 hr p.i., suggesting that EV71 infection can induce autophagosome formation. d 55% by 3-MA in Sham control mice without infection. EV71-induced LC3-II expression was suppressed about 73% at 24 hr p.i. in the presence of 3-MA compared with that of the EV71-infected group without 3-MA treatment. seven-day-old ICR suckling mice were inoculated intracranially with EV71 MP4 (5 105 pfu/mouse) mice were sacrificed at 24 hr p.i.. EV71 infection-induced autophagy in mice increased disease severity and viral titer. the effects of EV71-induced autophagy on disease symptoms, mortality, and viral replication in vivo remain undetermined. EV71 infection-induced autophagy increased viral titer and disease severity. seven-day-old ICR suckling mice were inoculated intracranially with 3-MA. the body weight and disease symptoms were monitored daily after inoculation for 6 and 7 days. e autophagosome, amphisome and autophagic flux are induced in EV71-infected cells. LC3 puncta (Green, a marker of autophagosome) abundantly colocalized with EV71 structural protein VP1 and nonstructural protein 2C. cells were treated with anti-LC3 rabbit polyclonal antibody and either anti-EV71 2C rat polyclonal antibody or anti-EV71 VP1 mouse monoclonal antibody. cells with or without EV71 infection were then treated with LC3 mouse monoclonal antibody and EV71 2C mouse monoclonal antibody. autophagic flux was induced in EV71-infected SK-N-SH cells. SK-N-SH cells were infected with EV71 for various times at MOI of 10. expression levels of LC3-II were increased as compared to levels in EV71-infected group without NH4Cl treatment. intensity of EV71 infection without NH4Cl as 1 at each time point. EV71 infection of the suckling mice caused physiopathological changes and mortality. previously reported that dengue virus type 2 and mouse-adapted EV71 (MP4 strain) infection induce autophagy in the brain tissues of ICR mice. EV71 infection caused physiopathological changes and mortality of the suckling mice. seven-day-old ICR suckling mice were inoculated with the EV71 mouse-adapted strain MP4. expression of EV71 VP1 in the brain tissues of control and suckling mice at day 2 p.i. was detected by immunohistochemical staining using anti-VP1 antibody. LC3 puncta, which represent autophagosomes, were colocalized with EV71 VP1 protein in the brain tissues of EV71-infected mice at 24 hr p.i. this finding is consistent with the results of our previous TEM investigation that showed VP1 protein colocalized with autophagosome-like vesicles. EV71 infection-induced LC3-II and VP1 expression was detected and increased in the brains of the mice LC3-II expression was suppressed 55% by 3-MA in mice without infection. EV71-induced LC3-II expression was suppressed about 73% accompanied with VP1 level was suppressed about 24% at 24 hr p.i. in the presence of 3-MA, EV-71-induced autophagy could be blocked by 3-MA, suggesting that autophagy plays a supportive role in EV71 replication. seven-day-old ICR suckling mice were inoculated intracranially with EV71 MP4 (5 105 pfu/mouse) mice were sacrificed at 24 hr p.i.. EV71-induced autophagy in mice increased disease severity and viral titer. the effects of EV71-induced autophagy on disease symptoms, mortality, and viral replication in vivo remain undetermined. suckling mice were inoculated intracranially with 3-MA (0.3 mg/mouse) 2 hr before inoculation with EV71 MP4 (5 105 pfu/mouse) the body weight and disease symptoms were monitored daily after inoculation. EV71-induced autophagy could trigger the autophagic flux and amphisome formation in human neuronal SK-N-SH cells. however, blocking autophagic flux by NH4Cl or vinblastine decreased VP1 expression, indicating that autophagic flux is beneficial for EV71 replication. a protein induces LC3 cleavage and translocation in epithelial cells. we compared viral structural protein VP1 and nonstructural protein 2C for their relationship with autophagosome and amphisome. EV71 2C protein is associated with host membrane vesicles, which form viral replication complexes. inhibition of autophagy may either inhibit or enhance apoptosis. further research is needed to establish whether EV71-induced autophagy enhances EV71 replication by suppressing apoptosis. this indicates that autophagy is involved in EV71-related pathogenesis and promotes viral replication in vivo. this suggests that autophagy increases EV71 infection-related pathogenesis of the mice, at least partially, through the promotion of viral replication. however, blockage of autophagy by 3-MA showed no significant increase of the survival rate of EV71-infected mice. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors' contributions YRL conducted this project and wrote the manuscript. the tissue sections were treated with anti-LC3 rabbit polyclonal antibody and anti-EV71 VP1 mouse monoclonal antibody and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. autophagosome formation was then investigated under a fluorescence microscope."}
