{"summary": "measles is an exceptionally contageous viral infection with a substantial degree of morbidity and significant mortality. the first scientific description of measles and its distinction from smallpox and chickenpox is credited to the Persian physician Rhazes (860\u2013932) this type of receptor mediated entry confined the tropism of MV to humans. nonhuman primates and some rodents are permissive to MV. no other animal reservoirs are known to exist. subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is another late complication of MV that leads to death. MV is implicated in the development of the neurological diseases SSPE. a progressive cerebral dysfunction occurs over a course of months. increased immunization has led to a 60\u201375% drop in measles deaths. the mortality rate as a consequence of measles is declining. many risk factors remain unsolved. MV is implicated in the development of the neurological diseases SSPE. it is characterized by an insidious onset of a progressive cerebral dysfunction occurring over a course of months. initial symptoms can involve the alteration in personality and deteriorating performance with periods of remissions. measles is declining, many risk factors remain unsolved. children with immunodeficiency due to HIV or AIDS, leukemia, or malnourished regardless of immunization status. infants who lose passive antibody before age of routine immunization. uated vaccines were less reactogenic and more suitable for use in vaccination campaigns without concomitant administration of gamma globulin. children are immunized against measles by the age of 18 mo, generally as part of the MMR vaccine (measles, mumps, and rubella) the vaccination is generally given at this age to avoid the interaction of the vaccine with maternal anti MV antibodies. globally, measles fell significantly from an estimated 873,000 deaths in 1999 to 345 000 in 2005. globally, measles fell significantly from an estimated 873,000 deaths in 1999 to 345 000 in 2005 and to 56 000 in 2014. measles vaccine is highly immunogenic when it is given in the correct dose to children of appropriate age. vaccines are live attenuated, they have the ability to infect and replicate in the host without causing symptoms of the wild type strain. re-exposure to the wild-type strain stimulates a secondary response in which IgG levels rise rapidly. the vaccine should be given whether the child is HIV-infected or not. it is less effective in HIV-infected infants than in the general population. but early treatment with antiretroviral drugs can increase its effectiveness. measles vaccines are usually administered subcutaneous of the freeze-dried vaccine reconstituted in saline solution or sterile/distilled water. the reconstituted vaccine is administered in 0.5 mL dose containing not less than 1000 TCID50 (tissue culture infectious doses) cinated persons re-infection with the wild-type will only cause subclinical boost of antibody levels. the development of techniques that allow the rescue of MV from cDNA was lagging due to the lack of essential tools to understand, attenuation, intracellular transport and assembly. the 3\u2032UTR of the M gene as well as the 5\u2032UTR of the F gene have a cross-regulatory function on the magnitude of F and M expression, thus inhibiting/compromising MV replication. the function of the M protein was addressed either by elimination of the ORF or by replacing this ORF by that of SSPE mutant. recombinant MVs expressing single or multiple genes of HIV61,62,64,65 in two distant MV vaccine backbones and different HIV-gene inserts induced significant immune responses. many other important rMVs were developed in these labs, inducing neutralizing antibodies (IgG) and cellular immune responses (CD8+ T cells) against MV. a revolutionary approach was done after the rescue of MV from cDNA. this technology allowed genetic engineering of the MV genome \u201cat will\u201d to generate a mutant that is fully replicating. a primordial step toward engineering a targeted MV was to determine whether envelope swaps or modification of attachment proteins H and/or is feasible. the role of the long untranslated region (UTR) of the Fusion (F) or Matrix (M) genes on virus replication and pathogenesis were studied by genetic manipulation of the full-length MV genome. a large deletion of 504 nucleotides of the 5\u2032 UTR of the F gene did not show any propagation deficit in cell culture. recombinant MVs expressing single or multiple genes of HIV61,62,64,65 in two distant MV vaccine backbones and different HIV-gene inserts induced significant immune responses (humoral and cellular) against the vector (MV) and the inserted antigens (HIV env and gag) upon immunization of transgenic mice. an alternative route to application of rMV to circumvent pre-existing antibodies would be the aerosol route. a revolutionary approach was done after the rescue of MV from cDNA. this technology allowed genetic engineering of the MV genome \u201cat will\u201d to generate a mutant that is fully replicating. clinical trials led by Mayo Clinic-USA showed positive impact and a promising prospective for the use of MV vector against cancer."}
