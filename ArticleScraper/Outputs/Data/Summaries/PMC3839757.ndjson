{"summary": "MCPIP1 inhibits HIV-1 production in both Transfection and Infection Systems. the inhibition was not observed in HSV-1 infection (Fig. S1) the knockdown was achieved on exogenously expressed GFP-tagged MCPIP1 in HIV-1 provirus-transfected HEK293 cells. a similar observation was made when the knockdown was achieved on exogenously expressed GFP-tagged MCPIP1. MT2 and MT4 human T-cell lines were induced to express GFP-MCPIP1 and then infected by NL4.3 virus. at 48 h postinfection, supernatants were collected for determination of the production of infectious virus and the release of p24. the production of HIV was nearly abolished after MCPIP1 induction in the HIV preinfected CEM-SS cells and the pNL4.3-transfected HEK cells. pGL3 reporter containing LTR or UTR (LTR + PBS + Psi) was transiently cotransfected into HEK293T cells with construct expressing MCPIP1 or control vector. the firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured 24 h after transfection. the cells were induced with various amount of Dox to express GFP-tagged MCPIP1 or GFP. at 48 h postinduction, the infectivity of culture supernatant was quantified. previously, MCPIP1 was shown to be an RNase that degrades cytokine mRNAs (24, 25) and cleaves precursor microRNAs (26). mutations that abolish the RNase activities of MCPIP1 also nullify its anti-HIV activity. cells were electroporated with siRNA against MCPIP1 (construct B) or scrambled siRNA (si-CTRL) at 100 nM. after 2 d of incubation, cellular RNA were isolated and subjected to quantitative RT-PCR analysis. thymus, spleen, lung, intestine, and adipose were significantly induced by LPS and other stimuli in macrophages. the endogenous level of MCPIP1 is slightly up-regulated in virus-infected A549 or HeLa cells. however, it remained unchanged in CEM-SS cells infected with HIV-1. endogenous MCPIP1 was detected by Western blotting. primary human PBMCs and purified CD4+ T cells were stimulated with PMA/Iono for 6 h. inhibition was not observed in HSV-1 infection (Fig. S1). MCPIP1-mediated restriction was also observed in both T- and M-tropic prototype viruses (89.6, NL4.3, NL4.3 with Env from AD8, and LAI.2) p24 (capsid protein) or TZM-bl assay to measure the production of infectious virus (B). p24 (capsid protein) or TZM-bl assay to measure the production of infectious virus (B) to identify the stage of the viral life cycle during which MCPIP1 restricts HIV-1, we generated CEM-SS\u2013 and HEK293-stable clones that express MCPIP1 in a doxycycline-inducible manner. the levels of intracellular viral proteins, including Gag, Env, and Nef, also decreased accordingly. however, copy numbers of provirus DNA did not change in the MCPIP1-expressing cells. mL Dox overnight to induce GFP-MCPIP1 or GFP. 48 h later, the culture supernatants were analyzed for the infectivity measured by TZM assay. the comparative number of viral RNA was quantified by real-time RT-PCR. at 24 h posttransfection, cells were induced with various amount of Dox to express GFP-tagged MCPIP1 or GFP. at 48 h postinduction, the infectivity of culture supernatant was quantified by TZM assay. the corresponding level of GFP-tagged MCPIP1 was measured by immunoblotting. MCPIP1 is known to localize to GW bodies where RNAs are stored. it is possible that MCPIP1 may affect both RNA stability and translation of viral proteins. HEK293T cells were transiently cotransfected with pNL4.3. hek293T cells were transiently cotransfected with pNL4.3. TZM assay measured the infectivity of the culture supernatant. culturing primary CD4+ T cells in phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and IL-2 also decreased MCPIP1 at the protein level. the decrease of MCPIP1 on PMA/Iono stimulation was reversed in the presence of MG132. CD4+ cells from three donors were nucleofected with pNL4.3. then treated with MG132 for 1 h followed by stimulation of PMA/Iono for 24 h before collection of supernatants. a primary block has long been noted to limit the reverse transcription of incoming virions. MCPIP1-mediated HIV-1 inhibition resembles that conferred by zinc-finger antiviral protein in the resistance both factors decrease viral mRNA species. if MCPIP1 directly recognizes and binds viral RNA, degrades viral RNA requires future investigation. the loss of MCPIP1 restriction during T-cell activation is likely to contribute to HIV-1 evasion and thus, AIDS pathogenesis. the human kidney epithelial cell line HEK293 (ATCC CRL-1573) and the baby hamster kidney fibroblast cell line BHK-21 (ATCC CCL-26) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection. the cytotoxicity of overexpression of MCPIP1 was also determined using the CellTiter-Glo Cell Viability Luminescent Assay Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega) plasmids, including mutants, have been previously constructed (21) EMCV was purchased from American Type Culture Collection. YFV-17D (NR-115; BEI Resources) and HCoV-OC43 (ATCC VR-1558) were propagated on vero cells. the transfection efficiency was nearly 100% under such conditions as monitored by transfecting a Cy3-labeled 27mer siRNA from OriGene (SR30002). PBMCs and purified CD4+ T cells were cultured at a density of 1 106/mL for 3 d in complete RPMI supplemented with 10 g/mL PHA (Roche) quantitation of HIV cDNA integration by real-time PCR was done by following a published protocol (37). the PCR conditions were 2 min at 50 \u00b0C and 10 min at 95 \u00b0C followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 \u00b0C and 1 min at 60 \u00b0C. ed, 4-kb mRNAs; multiply spliced, 1.8-kb mRNAs. relative mRNA levels of gag (unspliced), vif (singly spliced) and tat-rev (multiply spliced) were measured by a reporter assay. lysates containing equal amounts of protein were loaded onto 4\u201320% (vol/vol) TrisHCl gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. bar graphs were plotted to show mean SD. the human T-cell lines were cultured in RPMI-1640. TZM-bl, HEK293, BHK-21, and Vero were maintained in DMEM. the doxycycline-inducible cell lines were established using the Retro-X Tet-on 3G-inducible expression system (Clontech) anti-MCPIP1 (GTX110807; GeneTex), anti\u2013actin (4970; Cell Signaling), p24 (ab9071; Abcam) and anti\u2013HCoV-OC43 N (MAB9013; Chemicon) reagents were obtained through the National Institute of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program. the infectivity of YFV-17D\u2013 and HCoV-OC43\u2013containing samples was determined by cytopathic effect-based end-point dilution assay on vero E6 and BSC-1 cells. viral titers were expressed by TCID50/mL. 106/mL for 3 d in complete RPMI supplemented with 10 g/mL PHA (Roche) cells were then washed three times with cold PBS (DPBS) followed by total RNA isolation with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) Quantification of RNA was conducted using the QuantiFast SYBR Green RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen) doxycycline inducible system allows analysis of MCPIP1 on HIV RNA degradation in the context of infection but not transfection. blotting was performed according to a published protocol (21). HEK293T cells in 24-well plates were transfected with 0.2 g reporter plasmids and 0.2 g pCMV-MAT-Tag-FLAG-MCPIP1 or 0.2 g control plasmid. lysates were prepared with RIPA buffer. lysates containing equal amounts of protein were loaded onto 4\u201320% (vol/vol) TrisHCl gels. membranes were blocked in 5% (vol/vol) nonfat dry milk."}
