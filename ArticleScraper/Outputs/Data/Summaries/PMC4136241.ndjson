{"summary": "a cap-1 structure is typically generated by an RNA 5\u2032-triphosphatase (RTPase), which removes the -phosphate from the 5\u2032 end of the mRNA. a guanylyltransferase (GTase), which conjugates GMP to the mRNA through a 5\u2032-5\u2032 linkage. a ribose-2\u2032-O-methyltransferase (2\u2032-O-MTase 2\u2032-O-MTases catalyze methyl transfer through a catalytic Lys-Asp-Lys-Glu tetrad (10\u201312) viral capping enzymes may be found as independent entities with discrete activities or as components of multifunctional, multidomain proteins. rotavirus virion encapsidate 11 segments of dsRNA and several copies each of VP1, the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and a 98-kDa protein, VP3. VP3 binds covalently and reversibly to GMP, which it can transfer to pyrophosphate or GDP (19\u201321). VP3 also has affinity for single-stranded RNA. VP3 domain is predicted to resemble 2H-phosphoesterase superfamily members. it may contribute to virulence by antagonizing RNase L or methylating viral RNA at the 2\u2032-O position. a structure of the capping enzyme, VP4, from the orbivirus bluetongue virus type 10 (BTV10) has been reported (7). our findings suggest that the capping region of VP3 structurally resembles that of BTV10 VP4. we present biochemical evidence supporting our identification of the VP3 GTase domain. several of our predictions remain to be tested empirically.

I-TASSER assigns each model a confidence (C) score in the range of 5 to 2 for estimating the quality of a predicted model. the region of VP3 spanning amino acids 39 to 634 was modeled with an estimated precision score of 75%. each model was assigned >95% confidence, suggesting a 75% chance that BTV10 VP4 is a true structural homolog. Molecular graphics and analytical data were obtained using the UCSF Chimera package, v1.8.1 (Chimera) Chimera was developed by the Resource for Biocomputing, Visualization, and Informatics at the University of California, San Francisco. domains are colored gray (N terminus), green (N7-MTase), purple (2\u2032-O-MTase) or blue (GTase/RTPase) the most highly conserved positions are colored maroon, and the least conserved are colored cyan. locations of sequence motifs conserved among rotavirus and orbivirus capping enzymes and identified by sequence alignment are indicated. white squares highlight residues of the BTV10 VP4 2\u2032-O-MTase KDKE motif. predicted H(T/S) motifs in the PDE domain of rotavirus VP3 are outlined. a codon-optimized gene encoding the amino acid sequence of rotavirus strain RRV VP3 was synthesized by GenScript. the VP3 open reading frame was cloned into the Gateway vector pENTR-1A using engineered restriction sites to make plasmid RRV VP3 pENTR-1A. mutant VP3 sequences were verified by sequencing of purified plasmid DNA. radiolabeled VP3 was visualized and quantified using a Typhoon Trio+ variable-mode imager and ImageQuant (v5.1) software. the results of two replicate experiments from each of two batches of baculovirus-infected Sf9 lysates were quantified. the best available substitution model was selected by use of the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) program (v5.05) to be WAG+ +I (35). the ML tree was visualized using the FigTree program (v1.4.0; http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/).

Arg117 did not align precisely with a conserved arginine in the VP3 model. amino acid conservation in the predicted N-terminal and 2\u2032-O-MTase domains was notably higher in structure-based versus sequence-based alignments. rotavirus and orbivirus capping enzymes share a similar GTase/RTPase domain structure and a disrupted N7-MTase domain with a conserved SAH-binding site. high-confidence models were generated for two distinct regions of RRV VP3. the VP39 ligands SAH (yellow) and 7N-methyl-8-hydroguanosine-5\u2032-diphosphate (light blue) are shown. side chains of residues in the KDKE motif are shown (A to H) and indicated (H) structure-based alignment of AKAP7 central domain and the three models shown in panels A to C. residues that are identical (red) or similar (orange) for all sequences in the alignment are colored. HT motifs are outlined. structure-based sequence alignments of the RRV VP3 homology and threading models with BTV10 VP4 (PDB accession number 2JH8) revealed residues in the KDKE catalytic tetrad were similarly conserved. clade A rotavirus VP3 and RVH VP3 contain a 2\u2032-O-MTase domain. AKAP7 central domain (PDB accession number 2VFY) was identified as a homolog. confidence scores were only 46% (RVG 03V0567) and 35.8% (RVB CAL-1) we engineered baculoviruses expressing RRV VP3 with mutations in the predicted GTase domain. we quantified their capacity to covalently bind [32P]GMP. arginine or histidine can also form phosphoamide bonds and might theoretically serve this function (50) s of Arg591 and His650 failed to restore covalent GMP binding. the K541I substitution had a modest effect on VP3 autoguanylation. these findings provide support for our predictions about VP3 domain architecture. rotavirus species occupied distinct branches, consistent with previous phylogenetic analyses. RVA VP3 sequences were most highly represented in the ML tree. a tree of the amino acid sequences of rotavirus VP3, orbivirus VP4, and seadornavirus VP3 is shown. clade A rotavirus VP3 proteins shared 25 to 90% amino acid identity (39 to 95% similarity) clade B rotavirus VP3 proteins shared 25 to 90% amino acid identity (38 to 100% similarity) orbivirus VP4 proteins shared 33 to 50% identity (50 to 67% similarity) conserved residues are found throughout the region that align with the GTase/RTPase domain of BTV10 VP4. conserved residues include (VP4 numbering) Ser527, Arg531, Trp571, His610, and an SGH motif spanning residues 552 to 555. we wanted to map residues and sequence motifs onto the BTV10 VP4 structure. some loops were unresolved in the reported BTV10 VP4 structure. we used I-TASSER to generate a high-confidence model of the full-length protein. the three sequence motifs identified in the alignment correspond to an -helix that lines the deep depression in the GTase/RTPase domain (SGH) and the major SAH-binding surface in the N7-MTase domain (GxxxE(S/T) and LxL(S/T)NxxN) Arg122, which is conserved among all sequences in the alignment (Fig. 3C) simian RVA strain RRV is a VP3 structure and domain organization. we input the sequence of simian RVA strain into PHYRE (42) to search for homologs within a fold library generated from entries in the Structural Classification of Proteins database (46) and Protein Data Bank (PDB) (47) Arg117 did not align precisely with a conserved arginine in the VP3 model. amino acid conservation in the predicted N-terminal and 2\u2032-O-MTase domains was notably higher in structure-based versus sequence-based alignments of the BTV10 VP4 and the RRV VP3 models. rotavirus and orbivirus capping enzymes share a similar GTase/RTPase domain structure and a disrupted N7-MTase domain with a conserved SAH-binding site. high-confidence models were generated for two distinct regions of RRV VP3. VP39 ligands SAH (yellow) and 7N-methyl-8-hydroguanosine-5\u2032-diphosphate (light blue) are shown as stick representations. side chains of residues in the KDKE motif are shown (A to H) and indicated (H) structure-based alignment of AKAP7 central domain and the three models shown in panels A to C. residues that are identical (red) or similar (orange) for all sequences in the alignment are colored. HT motifs are outlined. structure-based sequence alignments of RRV VP3 homology and threading models with BTV10 VP4 revealed residues in the KDKE catalytic tetrad were similarly conserved. clade A rotavirus VP3 and RVH VP3 contain a 2\u2032-O-MTase domain. AKAP7 central domain (PDB accession number 2VFY) was identified as a homolog. confidence scores were only 46% (RVG 03V0567) and 35.8% (RVB CAL-1) we engineered baculoviruses expressing RRV VP3 with mutations in the predicted GTase domain. we quantified their capacity to covalently bind [32P]GMP. arginine or histidine can also form phosphoamide bonds and might theoretically serve this function (50) Arg591 and His650 failed to restore covalent GMP binding. the K541I substitution had a modest effect on VP3 autoguanylation. these findings provide support for our predictions about VP3 domain architecture. a viral mRNA would next encounter the conserved SAH-binding pocket of the N7-MTase domain, followed by the conserved SAH- and cap analog-binding clefts of the VP4 2\u2032-O-MTase domain. the pattern of VP3 amino acid conservation observed among clade A rotaviruses is similar to that of orbiviruses. RRV VP3 Arg577, His612 and His650 all contributed significantly to autoguanylation. RRV VP3 Arg591 fails to align precisely with a BTV10 VP4 residue but aligns with a region of BTV10 VP4 comprising a flexible surface loop. BTV10 VP4 (7) exhibits RTPase activity (56), but this activity has not been observed for hypotonically disrupted rotavirus subviral particles. additional studies are needed to unambiguously identify the sites of autoguanylation and RTPase mechanisms for both orbivirus and rotavirus. observed interactions with SAH in VP4 structures provide strong evidence that the N7-MTase architecture is conserved among orbivirus and rotavirus capping enzymes. the positional conservation of LxL(S/T)N or the entire LxL(S/T)NxxN motif in both BTV10 VP4-based VP3 models and the presence of amino acids conserved among clade A rotavirus VP3 proteins. methyltransferases (12), was also conserved across all of the modeled structures (Fig. 5) and BTV10 VP4 (Gly197) these findings reinforce the utility of homology modeling to predict the functions of proteins that share little sequence identity. the presence of a C-terminal PDE domain in some members of each rotavirus clade is consistent with the notion that it is a nonessential virulence determinant. the presence of a C-terminal PDE domain in some members of each rotavirus clade may have been lost from some rotavirus species over time. s in the future."}
