{"summary": "the combination of a specific anti-influenza compound with the broadly active antiviral polymer has huge potential for the treatment of respiratory infections. the combination of the specific anti-influenza drug Zanamivir together with carrageenan in a formulation suitable for intranasal application was evaluated in-vitro and in-vivo. influenza is an acute respiratory disease resulting in hospitalizations and deaths mainly among high-risk groups. worldwide, annual epidemics result in about three to five million cases of severe illness, and about 250,000 to 500,000 deaths. for this reason, there is a high medical need for a broadly acting antiviral therapy. carrageenan is a high molecular weight sulfated polymer derived from red seaweed. it is widely recognized as safe by the FDA (GRAS) three main forms of carrageenan are commercially used: kappa, iota and lambda. they differ from each other in the degree of sulfation, solubility and gelling properties. the use of carrageenan nasal spray was associated with a reduction of the influenza viral load in nasal fluids and a significant increase in the number of virus free patients within the treatment period of 7 days. the majority of influenza virus infected patients suffered from a concomitant respiratory viral infection (66%) as determined by real-time PCR. 156 of these participants got intranasally applied Zanamivir at different doses (daily dose levels from 6.4 mg to 96 mg) for prophylaxis or therapy. treatment starting before and up to 36 hours post virus inoculation was associated with prevention of laboratory confirmed influenza and febrile illness. the stock solution was diluted to a mixture containing 1.2 mg/ml iota-carrageenan and 0.4 mg/ml kappa-carrageenan. the identity and purity was confirmed by NMR analysis. for in-vivo studies all Zanamivir containing solutions were freshly prepared. i/2/68 (H3N2) was purchased from the ATCC. all influenza viruses were propagated in MDCK cells at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 in influenza medium. a semi-liquid plaque assay was developed. immunostaining cells were stained with 0.005% crystal violet solution. reduction represents a reduction in plaques and indicates suppression of viral replication during infection and cultivation. mice were purchased from Janvier Labs, France and maintained under standard laboratory conditions. treatment was performed intranasally either with 50 l therapeutic solution or placebo twice per day for 5 days. carrageenan and kappa-carrageenan are used at non-toxic concentrations. this 2x stock solution was sterile filtered through a 0.22 m filter. for further testing the stock solution was diluted to a mixture containing 1.2 mg/ml iota- and 0.8 mg/ml kappa-carrageenan. the identity and purity was confirmed by NMR analysis. all influenza viruses were propagated in MDCK cells at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 in influenza medium. 1.7x104 MDCK cells/well were seeded and infected at 90% confluence. serial dilutions of carrageenan and Zanamivir were prepared in assay medium. cells were incubated at RT for 45 min before inoculum removal. evolving plaques were evaluated after methanol/acetone cell fixation. mice were purchased from Janvier Labs, France. for infection experiments, 3\u20135 weeks old female mice were intranasally inoculated with 50 l influenza virus solution (25 l/nostril) treatment started 24 or 72 hpi, as indicated for the different experiments. the IC50 of Zanamivir and carrageenan against influenza A viruses of human and animal origin was determined using semi-liquid overlay in MDCK cells [60,61] using this method, we determined the sensitivity of various influenza virus strains to Zanamivir and carrageenan. the IC50 values of Zanamivir ranged from 0.18 M for H5N1 to 22.97 M for H7N7 and that of carrageenan from 0.39 g/ml to 118.48 g/ml for H1N1(09)pdm and H7N7, respectively. these results demonstrate that carrageenan and Zanamivir target individual influenza strains to different extent. isobolograms show synergistic interaction of carrageenan and Zanamivir. in both cases the combination provides synergistic activity with higher protection against a broader spectrum of influenza viruses than the individual compounds. the combination therapies led to 50% and 90% survival, depending on the Zanamivir concentration. both Zanamivir concentrations experienced significant benefit in survival by the combination with carrageenan (p0.0001) placebo or a combination of carrageenan and Zanamivir. treatment started either 48 hpi or 72 hpi and continued for 5 days. on the y-axis the survival of mice [%] and on the x-axis the time post infection [days] is given. placebo treated mice showed 100% survival in both experiments. in the following experiment the therapeutic potential of the combination with a therapy start 48 or 72 hpi was investigated in comparison with the respective placebo treatment. there was no difference in survival between the two therapy starting points, 48 or 72 hpi, which both resulted in 80% survival on day 15. sensitivity of various influenza virus strains to Zanamivir and carrageenan in adapted plaque reduction assay with semi-liquid overlay in MDCK cells [60,61]. IC50 values of carrageenan and carrageenan were calculated in comparison to untreated infected cells. the IC50 values of Zanamivir ranged from 0.18 M for H5N1 to 22.97 M for H7N7 and that of carrageenan from 0.39 g/ml to 118.48 g/ml for H1N1(09)pdm and H7N7, respectively. these results demonstrate that carrageenan and Zanamivir target individual influenza strains to different extents so that they may complement each other. a combination of Zanamivir and carrageenan synergistically protects mice from lethal influenza H7N7 infection. the combination provides synergistic activity with higher protection against a broader spectrum of influenza virus strains than the individual compounds. the combination synergistically protects mice from lethal influenza H7N7 infection. combination therapies led to 50% and 90% survival, depending on the Zanamivir concentration. mono-therapy with 1 mg/kg BW/day did not show significant benefit. mono-therapy with 3 mg/kg BW/day significantly increased survival rate. enan with Zanamivir (3 mg/kg BW/day) treatment started either 48 hpi or 72 hpi and continued for 5 days. on the y-axis the survival of mice [%] and on the x-axis the time post infection [days] is given. placebo treated mice showed 100% survival in both experiments. the survival rates of mice treated with the combination therapy were highly significantly increased in comparison to the placebo group (p0.0001) there was no difference in survival between the two therapy starting points, 48 or 72 hpi, which both resulted in 80% survival on day 15. combination of iota- and kappa-carrageenan (designated as carrageenan) was used for further evaluation. the combination showed a synergistic inhibition of virus replication in in-vitro assays with all tested influenza viruses. this indicates that the physical interaction of the polymer with the virus does not disturb the inhibition of the neuraminidase by Zanamivir. this indicates that the physical interaction of the polymer with the virus does not disturb the effects of the treatment on mortality is assessed in comparison to placebo-treated control mice. of all in-vitro tested influenza strains the H1N1(09)pdm and the LP H7N7 are particularly interesting for two reasons. the lowest effective dose for Zanamivir at a treatment start 24 hpi was found to be between 1 to 3 mg/kg BW/day for both viruses. this concentration range is relatively high in comparison to other published studies. however, a higher dose of NI is needed for an effective treatment when the therapy starts 24 hpi is already known for Oseltamivir [68] a combination of antiviral strategies has led to impressive achievements in the combat against other viral disease like HIV. in the last decade concerns have been raised about the increased emergence of Oseltamivir resistant influenza viruses. in contrast to Oseltamivir, resistance to Zanamivir is less frequent. patients would benefit from the fast and efficient treatment of uncomplicated influenza in the upper respiratory tract. due to the faster influenza virus clearance from the upper respiratory tract and the independent antiviral mechanism of carrageenan and Zanamivir the likelihood to develop escape mutations against Zanamivir will be reduced. treatment started 24 hpi and continued for 5 days. on the y-axis the survival of mice showed 100% survival. on the x-axis the time post infection [days] is given."}
