{"summary": "the aim of this study was to identify and define a set of public health emergency preparedness (PHEP) indicators to advance performance measurement for local/regional public health agencies. the study was conducted in canada with a national panel of 33 experts and completed in 2018. the world health organization (WHO) has called for all countries to create resilient integrated systems that can be responsive and proactive to any future threat. the ability to define and measure essential elements of public health emergency preparedness (PHEP) is important for local and regional public health agencies. the precise ways measurement and reporting influence health systems, however, remains unclear [10] PHEP aims to achieve preparedness for a range of possible hazards, both infectious (i.e. influenza) and non-infectious (i.e. natural disasters) the all-hazards approach is viewed as essential for public health system-level readiness. framework for resilience includes eleven essential elements and constitutes evidence-based approach to defining PHEP for local/regional public health agencies. the aim of this study is to identify and define a set of PHEP indicators aligned with the framework to advance performance measurement. a steering committee of knowledge users defined as professionals likely to use the results was consulted at key milestones [32]. a national study was conducted in Canada, where health services and programs are provided at the provincial/territorial level for ten provinces and three territories. leaders involved in PHEP in Canada include local public health officials, provincial public health and health emergency management partners. the final Delphi panel was comprised of 33 experts representing senior-level positions spanning all jurisdictional levels across 12 of 13 provinces and territories. self-reported areas of expertise included public health preparedness, response and management (63.6%) and health services

develop and refine lists of indicators for inclusion in the round one survey by framework element. panel members were asked to rate each indicator based on criteria for quality indicators. new indicators suggested by the panel during round 1 were extracted and analyzed using thematic analysis. a group of new indicators were developed for rating in round two. indicators with unclear consensus were retained, discarded or deemed unclear consensus. we used a modified Delphi technique with two rounds of online surveys based on a scoping review and indicators suggested by the panel. the use of existing literature to inform the first round is an established modification to the Delphi which enhances the efficiency of a time-consuming open-ended question only round [31]. the final Delphi panel was comprised of 33 experts representing senior-level positions across 12 of 13 provinces and territories. self-reported areas of expertise included public health preparedness, response and management (63.6%) and health services emergency preparedness, response and management (57.6%) orial jurisdictional level 22 (66.7) Federal jurisdictional level 3 (9.1) Other jurisdictional

from the final group of articles were synthesized with a hybrid approach of deductive and inductive thematic analysis, using NVivo 10. themes were identified from extracted indicators, corresponding with each framework element. ratings of agreement (5\u20137) and disagreement (1\u20134) were calculated into a percentage reflecting the level of panel consensus for each criterion statement by indicator. an a priori cut-off for consensus of 70% was used based on published ranges. new indicators suggested by the panel during round 1 were extracted and analyzed using thematic analysis. results Search results The librarian-assisted search yielded 4,516 articles and 117 grey literature sources. a total of six peer-reviewed articles and thirteen grey literature sources were included in the final group for indicator extraction. 41 of the 62 indicators proposed for rating, 41 achieved consensus agreement of 70% on importance and actionability. nineteen indicators achieved consensus agreement of 70% on importance but not actionability. a total of 35 indicators were incorporated into the round 2 survey. round one achieved a 100% response rate. feedback on the 12 indicators was reviewed and revised accordingly. the public health agency\u2019s policies define the conditions and procedures for using incident management structures and processes to coordinate agency activities in emergencies. the public health agency\u2019s policies define the conditions and procedures for escalating response to an emergency, including processes for declaring an event multi-jurisdictional. the public health agency has defined leadership competencies for individuals that may act as agency leaders in an emergency. these may include established effective relationships, local knowledge, credible, flexible, trusted, ethical. the public health agency reviews its emergency plans and/or protocols with involved departments and/or programs internal to the agency. the public health agency uses locally relevant data to inform risk assessment. examples of data sources may include communicable diseases, vector-borne diseases, food and water testing, population health determinants, non-communicable diseases such as injuries. the public health agency conducts a comprehensive risk assessment for all-hazards emergencies at regular intervals (e.g. annually, or when a new threat is identified) to adapt to emerging risks. the public health agency has dedicated financial resources to support planning and preparedness activities for emergencies. 7 (2) 28 84.8 5 (2) 24 72.7 Collaborative Networks (4 indicators) 30. the public health agency has mechanisms for contacting network partners in the event of an emergency. the public health agency has a mechanism to formally or informally coordinate joint messaging with relevant network partners in a timely manner. the public health agency has capacity for redundancy in communication platforms in the context of an emergency; for example, using alternate platforms in power outages or if regular communication channels are down. the public health agency has a roster of its workforce available for the management of emergencies on a 24/7/365 basis. the public health agency has established policies and procedures for supporting staff during an emergency. the public health agency has a structure and/or mechanism to

emergencies in a timely manner. the public health agency has the capability to conduct rapid health risks and/or needs assessments for communities recently impacted by emergencies. the self-assessment process is used to identify capabilities, strengths and/or assets to describe successes relevant to emergency management. health agency management and staff have demonstrated the ability to adjust plans and protocols for emergencies in the context of new knowledge, uncertain science, and/or differences in professional opinions. the public health agency has sufficient resources to practice plans and protocols relevant to emergency management; for example, the emergency response plan, the business continuity plan. 62 indicators were identified for round one panel rating. PHEP Framework Element Theme No. of Indicators Governance and leadership. the response rate for round one by indicator was 100%. of the 62 indicators proposed for rating, 41 achieved consensus agreement of 70% on importance and actionability. the remaining 21 indicators had unclear consensus. round three meeting, participation ranged from 22\u201328 members (67\u201385%) at the meeting, three indicators reached consensus and two indicators were discarded. seven indicators were deemed to be important but not actionable. the public health agency\u2019s policies define the conditions and procedures for escalating response to an emergency, including processes for declaring an event multi-jurisdictional. the public health agency is a member of a local/regional multidisciplinary structure that aims to reduce community risks to emergencies and disasters. network partners involved in this structure may include transportation, planners, industry, local/regional elected officials. the public health agency has a process to support priority-setting decisions in the allocation of limited resources in the context of emergencies. 6 (1) 29 87.9 6 (3) 24 72.7 17. The public health agency\u2019s emergency management plans relate to all phases of a disaster (i.e. Prevention/mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery) public health agency has or has access to a dedicated emergency preparedness coordinator, or similar position, led by an individual experienced in emergency management. 7 (1) 32 97 5 (1) 26 78.8 26. the public health agency has or has access to a dedicated emergency preparedness coordinator, or similar position, led by an individual experienced in emergency management. the public health agency provides and/or endorses education programs directed at the public to raise awareness about preparedness for local risks. the public health agency dedicates time for the continuous development of relationships with community organizations relevant to preparedness for local risks. the public health agency has or participates in an established structure to facilitate inclusion of community considerations in relevant aspects of public health emergency management. the public health agency has access to communications personnel dedicated to the emergency and appropriately trained in crisis communication. 6 (1) 31 93.9 6 (1) 26 78.8 45. the public health agency communication strategy includes plans and/or procedures for ensuring cultural competency and/or sensitivity to impacted communities for relevant risks and the emergency context. the public health agency has a workforce professional development plan for training its staff that is specific to emergency management topics. 6 (1) 30 90.9 6 (1) 25 75.8 53. the public health agency has an up to date inventory of staff trained in emergency management topics. the public health agency self-assessment process is used to identify capabilities, strengths and/or assets to describe successes relevant to emergency management. 6 (2) 28 84.8 6 (2) 27 81.8 62. the self-assessment process is used to inform improvement actions; for example, identifying responsible groups for corrective actions and establishing timelines for change. the number of indicators per other element ranged from five to seven. 76 indicators were proposed for rating across all three rounds. a total of 67 were considered to be important and actionable PHEP indicators. our set of indicators aligns with a PHEP framework comprised of essential elements identified based on empiric data for local/regional public health agencies. the indicators correspond with the essential elements and were assessed through this study as relevant to PHEP. this additional group of indicators is highly relevant to PHEP practice due to the high importance ratings. however, these seven indicators highlight the complexity around measuring PHEP and the PHEP system. the 67 indicators represent important and actionable dimensions of PHEP practice that can be used and validated by local/regional public health agencies to assess readiness and measure improvement. the indicators are situated in a framework that includes empirically-derived essential elements for PHEP for local/regional public health agencies.
