{"summary": "polymorphisms of RANTES, IP-10 and Mig affect the susceptibility to and outcome of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) results RANTES -28 G allele was associated with SARS susceptibility in Hong Kong Chinese (P 0.0001, OR = 2.80, 95%CI:2.11\u20133.71) we have demonstrated that genetic haplotypes associated with low serum mannose-binding lectin are associated with SARS[4] and our findings were confirmed in another independent study [5]. other susceptibility genes, such as liver/lymph node-specific ICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin (L-SIGN) and myxovirus resistance 1 were also identified. RANTES -28 G allele was associated with disease susceptibility and severity of SARS. the mean SD age was 40.74 15.73 years with 211 males and 284 females. at least 95% of the patients were documented with SARS-CoV antibody seroconversion. 20 patients were classified as severe group, which were identified by their admissions to intensive care units or deaths from SARS (mean SD age = 39.45 12.8, 11 male and 9 female) the remaining 336 patients were classified as mild group (mean SD age = 34.57 13.5, 189 male and 147 female) a mixture of 0.2 L of hME buffer, 0.3 L of shrimp alkaline phosphatase (1 unit/L, Sequenom) and 1.5 L of ddH2O was added to the PCR products. mass-extend reactions were performed in four groups of different terminations according to the design rationale (ddACG, ddACT, ddAGT and ddCGT, respectively) TTGGATGTGGTTGAAAAAAGCAACCCC Extension CCTGCTGCTATGCATTC IP-10 nt2867 Forward ACGTTGGATGTCAACCATGAAAGACTTGGG Reverse ACGTTGACCCTGATTACCAGTCAACC Extension TCAACCTTGAAGTACAGCTATAAC Mig nt367 Forward ACGTTGGATGTCAACCATGAAAGACTTGGG Reverse ACGTTGACCCTGATTACCAGTCAACC Extension T the genes between the death group and the survival group of SARS patients were tested by a 3 2 chi-square test and a 2 2 chi-square test respectively. the genotype frequencies of all the SNPs were tested separately in SARS patients and controls by chi-square test. a total of 367 ethnically matched healthy individuals served as controls. RANTES -28C/G (rs2107538) was genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) as described previously. PCR conditions included initial hot-start for 15 min at 95\u00b0C, 45 cycles of amplification (20 sec at 95\u00b0C, 30 sec at 56\u00b0C and 1 min at 72\u00b0C) and final extension for 3 min at 72\u00b0C. PCR products were treated with alkaline phosphatase to dephosphorylate residual amplification nucleotides.

RANTES -28 G allele was a risk factor that associated with severe clinical outcomes in both Hong Kong and Beijing Chinese SARS patients. the RANTES -28 G allele was associated with death in patients with SARS. it was associated with admission to intensive care units or deaths due to SARS. it has been suggested that Chinese in southern and northern China may be genetically distinct [20,21], accounting for the different observations. the Research Fund for the Control of Infectious Diseases (03040302) from the health, welfare and food Bureau of theHong Kong SAR Government."}
