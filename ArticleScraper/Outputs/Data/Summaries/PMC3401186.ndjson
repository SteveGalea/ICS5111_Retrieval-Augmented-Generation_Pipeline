{"summary": "by June 11, the world health organization raised the pandemic alert level to its highest level. the novel H1N1 pandemic strain (H1N1pdm) tended to affect younger healthier populations and had an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. a fatal viral pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome occurred in approximately 18,000 cases. ferrets have been used as an animal model of influenza infection and pathogenesis since 1934. ferrets can be infected by human isolates without adaptation. ferret has long trachea, large lung capacity, and bronchiolar branching. new studies have shown the utility of the [18F]-FDG in assessment of infectious disease burden in animal models of schistosomiasis and tuberculosis [28]\u2013[30]. the uptake of [18F]-FDG in humans and animals suggests the predominant presence of activated neutrophils [32]\u2013[35] in mice infected with influenza A virus, neutrophils play a critical role in protection and recovery from infection. in vivo imaging with these modalities suggests increased pulmonary inflammation as the amount of circulating virus becomes undetectable. these results suggest that molecular imaging will be a great asset in gaining insight into the temporal and spatial progression of the inflammatory process caused by influenza virus infection. the pandemic H1N1 isolate KY/180 employed in these studies was isolated from nasal swab sample provided by the Severe Influenza Surveillance project. two animals in each group were euthanized on days 2, 14 and 18 to determine virus and HI titers in blood, lung and several additional organs at 2 DPI. body weight showed a drop on day 2 where the weight remained for the remainder of the study. a cohort of six control and six KY/180-infected ferrets were examined for A) body weight and B) temperature over a period of 10 days. a cohort of six control and six KY/180-infected ferrets were examined for the presence of HI and antibody titers. FDG-PET and CT images of the thorax were successfully obtained and fused for two ferrets on days 1, 2, 3 and 6. volumes of interest (VOI) and corresponding maximum standardized uptake values (SUVMax) were generated for any metabolically active lesions in the lung. day 0 shows background activity in the lung with minimal uptake in the mediastinal and subcarinal lymph nodes. day 1 post-infection demonstrates an area of developing consolidation in the right caudal lobe and into the left caudal lobe. by day 3, the consolidation has spread in the right caudal lobe and into the left caudal lobe. each day each ferret was swabbed in the nasal, throat and fecal passages and the viral titer was measured by TCID50. the highest levels of viral shedding were measured in the throat swabs. four sections were taken per lobe to provide greater insight into the spread of the virus in the tissue. high levels of virus were detected in all nasal turbinate samples at 1, 2, and 3 DPI (95% C.I. = 5.43+/1.00 TCID50/mL) vir was also detected in a majority of lung sections from 1, 2, and 3 DPI. the right caudal lobe of each ferret was divided into 4 sections. sections were taken for histopathology from the right and left cranial lobes, left caudal lobe and the middle accessory lobe. the ferrets in the control group had intact bronchiolar walls with very minimal infiltration by neutrophils. on day 3, a bronchiole with necrosupprative exudate is highlighted at 10 for animal 2212. muscle (M) defines the bronchiole from which the epithelium has been sloughed and the lumen is filled with neutrophils (necrosuppurative bronchiolitis) on day 7, a bronchiole with necrosupprative exudate is highlighted at 10 for animal 2212. the SUVMax of lesions in the right and left lung of each ferret was compared with the cumulative histopathology scores assigned by the veterinary pathologist. on average, the SUVMax was higher in the right lung than the left lung but the slopes and Spearman\u2019s correlation coefficients were similar between the two sides. a weaker positive correlation was seen between the cumulative bronchiolitis score and SUVMax. the 50% infectious dose in female ferrets was determined to be 100.07 TCID50. in group 1, six ferrets were mock infected with PBS. in group 2, six ferrets were mock infected with KY/180 with a 0.5 ml dose of 0.5105.7 TCID50 per naris. on day 2, viral titers were the highest in the nasal turbinates (106.25 TCID50/g) followed by the caudal lung (106.0 TCID50/g) and trachea (103.75 TCID50/g). the lowest levels of virus were observed in the cranial lobe of the lung (103.2 TCID50/g). group animalID Day 0 Day 1 Day 2 Day 3 Day 6 Day 7 1 2206/7 \u00a3 2210/3 2 2208 \u00a3, 2209 \u00a3, 3 2202 \u00a3, 2204 \u00a3, 4 2211

developing consolidation in the right caudal lobe corresponding to increased radiotracer uptake. by day 3, the consolidation appears in the right caudal lobe and into the left caudal lobe. by day 6, there are multiple lesions in the lung parenchyma bilaterally with intense radiotracer uptake. each day each ferret was swabbed in the nasal, throat and fecal passages. the highest levels of viral shedding were measured in the throat swabs. 0 3.5 0 Throat 4.5 4.3 3.5 Rectal 1.0 0 0 5 2213 Nasal 3.8 4.3 3.5 1.5 Throat 5.5 2.7 5.0 2.0 Rectal 0 0 0 5 2214 Nasal 4.0 3.7 3.3 0 Throat 6.7 3.7 5.3 0

part of the epithelial layer. mixed cell alveolitis surrounds the bronchiole. more extensive infiltration of neutrophils can be seen within the bronchiolar lumen, along with necrosupprative bronchiolitis and mixed cell alveolitis. at day 7 lesions continued to exhibit an increased severity compared to the majority of lung lesions seen at 1 and 2 DPI. clinical isolate KY/180 has a change in the HA1 gene, D222G. the change in H1N1pdm correlates with increased severity of disease. studies in mice and ferrets infected with pandemic influenza viruses have shown that the D222G mutation are lethal in mice, but not ferret. the ferret lung demonstrated progressive consolidation on CT and FDG uptake on PET predominantly in the right caudal lobe. by day 6, the diffuse metabolically active lesions seen on PET/CT were similar to what has been reported in the human literature during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. progressive nature of the pulmonary lesions corroborated radiologic data. inflammation tended to be patchy or multifocal and an entire lung lobe was never uniformly affected. our study aims to correlate FDG uptake measurements with histology. we plan to explore additional radiotracers that might reveal potential differences in host responses in the immune system. future studies will assess differences in presentation of those who recover from infection versus those who eventually succumb to infection such as with more lethal isolates such as H5N1. the facility where this research will be conducted is fully accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International. all female ferrets were obtained from Triple F Farms (Sayre, PA) ferrets measured viral titers in blood, lung, brain, trachea, nasal turbinates, spleen, kidney, thymus, liver, duodenum, jejuno-ileum, large intestine, and rectum. at 14 and 28 days post-infection two additional ferrets from each group were analysed for viral titers and pathology in the lung. four ferrets were imaged with CT and PET on hardware designed for preclinical animal studies. each day, four ferrets were euthanized and necropsied to obtain tissue samples for virologic and histopathologic analyses. for each ferret, 2 mCi of 18F-FDG was administered (i.p.) with a 60\u201390 min uptake period. radioactive dose was confirmed with an Atomlab 500 Dose Calibrator. PET images were co-registered with the CT images. for all VOIs, maximum SUV (SUVMax) and average and standard deviation of all pixels in the volume (SUVMean SD) were calculated. image interpretation was performed by a radiologist having more than ten years of diagnostic experience. ground-glass opacity (GGO) is defined in this study as hazy increased lung opacity. each sample was analyzed in quadruplicate following incubation in 96-well plates. supernates were collected from each well were assayed for hemagglutination activity using 0.5% turkey red blood cells as an indicator of infection. sections were mounted on glass slides and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. sections were examined for presence of abnormal findings including supprative and necrosupprative inflammation; epithelial hyperplasia and cytokaryomegaly; and fibrinous and exudative changes. the allantoic fluid was harvested 72 h after inoculation, pooled and stored in stored aliquots at 80C until use. the infectious virus titer of the resulting seed stock was determined by TCID50 (50% tissue culture infectious dose) and the titer calculated by Reed and Muench [46] and confirmed by plaque assay on MDCK cells. six animals were inoculated intransally (i.n.) with 0.5 mL of infectious virus per naris as a bolus with PBS (mock) on day 2 post-infection, two ferrets were taken to measure viral titers in blood, lung, brain, trachea, nasal turbinates, spleen, kidney, thymus, liver, duodenum, jejuno-ileum, large intestine anesthetic induction and maintenance were achieved with 1\u20133% isoflurane. blood glucose levels were checked prior to administration of the radiolabeled tracer to ensure that they were within normal limits. glucose was provided to animals to compensate for body fluids lost during imaging. the inveon PET detector provided an axial field of view (FOV) of 12.7 cm with a spatial resolution of 1.44 mm. for each ferret, 2 mCi of 18F-FDG was administered (i.p.) with a 60\u201390 min uptake period. uclide half-life set at 6586.2 sec for 18F-FDG. automatic isocontour detection was used to refit the VOI. for all VOIs, maximum SUV (SUVMax) and average and standard deviation of all pixels in the volume (SUVMean SD) were calculated. swab and tissue samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80\u00b0C until analyzed for virus titer by TCID50. tissue homogenate and swabs were serially diluted 10-fold in DMEM with 2 g/mL TPCK-Trypsin, 0.2% BSA, 4.5 g/L glucose, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 25 HI positive wells were scored based on a diffuse sheet of agglutinated RBCs. if they showed a well circumscribed button of nonagglutinated RBCs, they were incubated for 1 h."}
