{"summary": "alphaherpesviruses have a much broader host range and are able to infect a wide variety of cell types. beta and gamma herpesvirinae subfamilies exhibit restricted or limited cell-type tropism. alphaherpesviruses have a much broader host range and are able to infect a wide variety of cell types. nectin-1 is an immunoglobulin (Ig)-like cell adhesion molecule. it is highly conserved in mammalian animals. gD proteins of these alphaherpesviruses bind to nectin-1 with nanomolar affinities. the receptor, with three Ig-like domains arranged into a rod-shaped structure, projects its membrane-distal IgV domain for gD engagement[21\u201323] it is notable that the whole gD footprint in nectin-1 overlaps extensively with the nectin-1 dimerization interface. gD is also believed to play a key role in triggering the membrane fusion cascade. PRV gD infects host cells via both human and swine nectin-1, but not with human HVEM. gD variant lacking the C-terminal membrane-proximal residues exhibited much higher affinity for nectin-1. swine nectin-1 (SW-nectin-1) serves as a cellular receptor for PRV. CHO-K1 cell lacks any known alphaherpesvirus receptors and is therefore resistant to PRV infection. transient expression of HU- and SW-nectin-1 in CHO-K1 cells suffices cells for PRV entry. luciferase activity was calculated and quantitatively compared with that observed for SW-nectin-1. results of three independent experiments were histogrammed as means standard deviations (SD) runcated PRV gD protein spanning residues 1\u2013337 (hereafter referred to as gD337) using a baculovirus expression system. the residue numberings for PRV gD amino acids in previous structural studies are based on the mature protein. the boundaries of the domain elements, including the signal peptide (SP), the ectodomain, the transmembrane domain (TM) and the cytoplasmic domain (CP), were determined by bioinformatic predictions using the SignalP4.1 and TMHMM web-server. the protein was truncated (aa 1\u2013337 for gD337 and aa 1\u2013284 for gD284), engineered with a GP67 signal peptide the resultant protein was similarly prepared via the baculovirus expression system. the calculated Kds of gD284 to the human and swine receptors were 16.1 nM (Kon, 7.25 105 M-1s-1; Koff, 1.17 102 s-1) and 18.4 nM (Kon, 1.15 106 M-1s-1; Koff, 2.11 102 s-1) gD337 contains 244 amino acids spanning from P7 to P250. the terminal residues (A1 to V6 in the N-terminus and R251 to S337 in the C-terminus) were untraceable. we believe these two parts are flexible and most likely disordered loops. core-domain, which spans from D38 to V164, contains a nine-stranded (A', B, C, C', C'', D, E, F, and G) -barrel in the center, leading to two strand halves connected with a distorted loop. similar kinked strand has also been observed in both HSV-1 and HSV-2 gD structures. structure-based sequence alignment for PRV gD and its HSV homologs. sequences of the signal peptide sequence, the C-terminal membrane-proximal loop, and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains were not included for the comparison. despite the low sequence identity, a majority of the secondary structure elements were parallel-formed in PRV and HSV gDs. however, the PRV structure contains an extra 2' helix in the C-terminal extension. in-1 obtained a complex crystal that diffracts to 2.7 resolution. the complex structure contains gD residues P9-D241 and nectin-1 amino acids D37-M143. similar proportion of the gD residues were successfully traced in both the free gD and the gD/nectin-1 complex structures. the gD molecule is colored as in Fig 3A, and the membrane-distal IgV domain of SW-nectin-1 is shown in cyan. the free PRV gD structure was aligned to the complex structure in (B) to highlight the reorientation of the gD N-terminal loop upon receptor binding. a shift-distance of about 3.5 was observed between the PRV and HSV gDs. the receptor CC' loop also showed quite different conformations when bound to the viral ligands of PRV and HSV. F11 of gD is located in the N-loop region that was shown to undergo large conformational changes after receptor binding. the subsequent interactions of F11 with nectin-1 K61 and F129 are the major forces stabilizing the observed N-loop orientation in the complex structure. interface residues in the receptor are absolutely conserved between HU- and SW-nectin-1. the interface components in PRV gD, including the N-loop, the 1' helix in the IgV-like core, and the 2', 3', 3 helices and the 3'/3 intervening loop in the C-terminal extension, are highlighted. the nectin-1 residues locating within a distance of 4.5 from the bound ligand were selected and compared in detail. the subsequent interface-residue list revealed 31 amino acids interacting with PRV gD, 22 with HSV-1 gD and 26 with HSV-2 gD. of these residues, 20 were utilized for contacting all the three viral ligands, contributing more than 90% of the total inter-molecule contacts with either ligand. the nectin-1 amino acids locating within a distance of 4.5 from the bound ligand (PRV gD) were selected, and then listed in a pairwise manner. the number of Van der Wa. the key interface residues in nectin-1 were individually mutated and tested for their interactions with PRV gD337. mutation of the key interface residues in nectin-1 undermines the interaction with PRV gD. the results are expressed as means SD from three independent experiments. the affinities of the nectin-1 N77 and M85 for gD337 were determined to be 3.4 M and 2.8 M, respectively. nectin-1 has been shown to mediate the cell entry of multiple alphaherpesviruses. both human (HU-nectin-1) and swine nectin-1 (SW-nectin-1) serve as a cellular receptor for PRV. CHO-K1 cell lacks any known alphaherpesvirus receptors and is therefore resistant to PRV infection. CHO-K1 cells expressing PRV gD/gB/gH/gL and T7 luciferase were mixed and incubated with those expressing T7 polymerase in combination with HU-/SW-nectin-1 or HU-HVEM. results of three independent experiments were histogrammed as means standard deviation (SD) the entire ectodomain of PRV gD could be yielded as a recombinant protein in the soluble form [13] using a baculovirus expression system. the ecto-domain proteins of both HU- and SW-nectin-1 prepared from E. coli were individually immobilized on the chip and tested for the interaction with gD337. d values are also in good accordance with a previous study reporting an affinity of 130 nM for the PRV-gD/HU-nectin-1 interactions. the boundaries of the domain elements, including the signal peptide (SP), the ectodomain, the transmembrane domain (TM) and the cytoplasmic domain (CP), were determined by bioinformatic predictions using the SignalP4.1 and TMHMM web-server. this new construct spans the gD amino acids 1\u2013284 (hereafter referred to as gD284). the resultant protein was similarly prepared via the baculovirus expression system. the calculated Kds of gD284 to the human and swine receptors were 16.1 nM. gD337 and gD284 were subjected to intensified crystallization screenings. the solved structure was refined to Rwork = 0.169 and Rfree = 0.192. the terminal residues (A1 to V6 in the N-terminus and R251 to S337 in the C-terminus) were untraceable. the overall PRV gD structure is expectedly composed of an IgV-like core and the long N- and C-terminal extensions. the core-domain, which spans from D38 to V164, contains a nine-stranded (A', B, C, C', C'', D, E, F, and G) -barrel in the center. similar kinked C'' strand has also been observed in both HSV-1 and HSV-2 the shaded circles and the arrows mark the variant secondary structure elements. the right panel is rotated along a vertical axis for about 135 degrees. a structure-based sequence alignment for PRV gD and its HSV homologs. the structure of PRV gD is quite similar to those of its HSV homologs. despite the low sequence identity, a majority of the secondary structure elements were parallel-formed in PRV and HSV gDs. the PRV structure contains an extra 2' helix in the C-terminal extension. the structure of PRV gD bound with swine nectin-1 is 2.7 resolution. the complex structure contains gD residues P9-D241 and the nectin-1 amino acids D37-M143. similar proportion of gD residues were successfully traced in both the free gD and the gD/nectin-1 complex structures. structure of the PRV-gD/SW-nectin-1 complex is labeled. the gD molecule is colored as in Fig 3A. the membrane-distal IgV domain of SW-nectin-1 is shown in cyan. the nectin-1 binding mode of PRV gD resembles its HSV counterparts. a shift-distance of about 3.5 was observed between the PRV and HSV gDs. the receptor CC' loop also showed quite different conformations when bound to the viral ligands. in the N-loop, two aromatic residues F11 and W22 were projected outwards for receptor binding. they were packed against nectin-1 amino acids K61, Q64, I80, N82, M85-S88, and F129. the subsequent interactions of F11 with nectin-1 K61 and F129 are the major forces stabilizing the observed N-loop orientation in the complex structure. PRV gD interacting with SW-nectin-1 Q76, N77 and A91, gD P206 with nectin-1 Q64, and gD Y208 with nectin-1 T63 and A127. residues in the receptor are absolutely conserved between HU- and SW-nectin-1. gV domains that are recognized by PRV gD are marked with black stars. only those that contribute >2 inter-molecule Van der Waals contacts were selected. comparison of their footprints in nectin-1 reveals the same surface patch in the receptor. 66 (1 contact) T66 (1 contact) Q68 (1 contact) Q68 (12 contacts) A70 (1 contact) \u2014\u2014\u2014 G73 (5 contacts) \u2014\u2014 G73 (4 contacts) S74 (11 contacts) \u2014\u2014 S74 (3 contacts) K75 (24 contacts) K75 (7 contacts) Q76 (14 contacts) N77 (29 contacts) N77 (42 contacts) I80 (11 contacts) I80 (11 contacts) Y81 (1 contact) Y81 (1 contact) Y81 (1 mutation of key interface residues in nectin-1 undermines interaction with PRV gD. amino acids used to contact all three viral ligands were highlighted in boldface. CHO-K1 cells expressing PRV gD/gB/gH/gL and T7 luciferase were mixed and incubated with those expressing T7 polymerase in combination with wild type or mutant HU-nectin-1. the results are expressed as means SD from three independent experiments. nectin-1 is likely the most effective in terms of its wide usage by different viruses. the structures of both the free HSV gD and its complex with nectin-1 are reported at high resolution [6, 21, 22, 25]. a large C-terminal region of the gD molecule is untraceable in the free gD and the nectin-1 bound structures. a flexible N-loop which experiences rearrangement or is structurally stabilized upon receptor binding has also been observed for HSV gDs. a total of 20 residues were recognized by all the three viral ligands. it is notable that these amino acids contribute the majority of the inter-molecule interactions. the remaining nectin-1 residues provided additional and supplementary contacts for engagement of gD. a short gD protein lacking PFD is about 100-fold more competent than the long gD form in terms of receptor binding. the affinity of PRV gD284 for nectin-1 is also dramatically (12\u201316 folds) higher than that of gD337 (a long gD form containing the whole ectodomain) this argues against a prelocation of the membrane-proximal loop in PRV gD. it may indicate a novel mechanism of the loop interfering with nectin-1 binding. this may indicate a novel mechanism of the loop interfering with nectin-1 binding. CHO-K1 cells were incubated with pcDNA4.0-HU-nectin-1, pcDNA4.0-HU-HVEM or pcDNA4.0-SW-nectin-1 expression plasmids. after 24 h, cells were incubated with PRV bartha-K61 solution (100 TCID50/ml PRV in DMEM) fragments were then individually cloned into the prokaryotic expression vector pET21b (Invitrogen) the proteins were expressed as inclusion bodies in E. coli BL21 (DE3) and the inclusion bodies were prepared in a buffer composed of 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 400 mM L-Arginine, 2 mM EDTA, 5 mM reduced glutathione and 1 mM oxidized glutathione the resultant DNA fragments that contain a C-terminal 6his coding sequence were then individually cloned into a previously modified pFastBac1 vector. the pFastBac1 construct for gD (residues 1\u2013285, gD285) was engineered to incorporate a baculovirus gp67 signal sequence at the N-terminus [39\u201341] gD and nectin-1 proteins were purified by gel filtration using superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) about 1,200 response units of nectin-1 were immobilized on the chip. a serial of concentrations up to 2,500 nM were designed for the experiment. diffractable crystals were finally obtained by mixing 1 L of the protein complex with 1 L reservoir solution consisting of 0.2 M sodium chloride, 0.1 M sodium acetate pH 5.5, 20% w/v PEG 10,000. diffraction datasets were collected at beamline BL19U1 using the synchrotron radiation at 100K. the plasmids for PRV gB, gD, gH, gL and the plasmids for nectin-1 and the T7 polymerase were separately co-transfected into CHO-K1 cells using Lipo2000 (Invitrogen) after 24 h of transfection, the cells expressing gB/gD/gH/gL and nectin-1 were mixed and incubated for cell fusion. expression plasmids and preparation of proteins DNAs encoding the ectodomains of the human and swine nectin-1 (amino acids 30\u2013335) were obtained by PCR using primer pairs of human-Nectin1-F (5'-CGCGGATCCCGCGCGCTTCTGTGATGAAC -3') and porcine-Nectin1-F (5'-AAGGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA gD284) and 1\u2013337 (gD337) were amplified by PCR using the same forward primer of PRV-gD-F (5'-CCGGAATTCAGGACGTGGACGCCGCG-3') the resultant DNA fragments that contain a C-terminal 6his coding sequence were then individually cloned into a previously modified pFastBac1 vector. all the proteins were expressed with the Bac-to-Bac the proteins were purified from the hi5 cell supernatants first by nickel affinity chromatography (GE Healthcare) and then by gel-filtration chromatography using a superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) the mutant proteins of human nectin-1 ectodomain were prepared as previously described. free PRV gD crystal was finally obtained by mixing 1 l of the concentrated gD337 protein at 10 mg/ml with 1 L reservoir solution consisting of 0.1 M ammonium acetate, 0.1 M bis-tris pH 5.5, 17% w/v polyethylene glycol 10,000. two proteins (gD284 and SW-nectin-1 IgV) were separately purified by gel-filtration chromatography, mixed at 1:1 molar ratio. fusion mediated by HSV gB/gD/gH/gL and receptors has been validated in various cell types. the genes of PRV gB, gD, gH, and gL and nectin-1 were cloned into the pcDNA4.0-myc-his vector to yield respective plasmids for protein expression in mammalian cells."}
