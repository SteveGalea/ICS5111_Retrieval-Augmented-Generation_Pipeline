{"summary": "about 20% of bovines submitted to the Danish Veterinary Laboratory for necrosy originate from cattle with a history of respiratory symptoms. BRSV has a predilection for the lower respiratory tract and may damage the respiratory tract epithelium directly followed by changes induced by, i.e. inflammatory mediators. cattle herds, each producing approximately 1000 calves a year were included. in herd A, new calves, aged 2\u20134 weeks were purchased from different sources every second month. in herd B, the calves were purchased and reared as described for herd A. necropsied calves and nasal swabs tested for presence of BRSV, bovine corona virus (BCV), bovine parainfluenza-3 (PI-3) virus, and bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) tests for infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) virus are not routinely performed. activated vaccine contained at least 0.80 SN.U (1 SN.U is the quantity necessary to obtain 1 log10 sero-neutralising antibodies in the guinea-pig. in both herds all calves received 2 subcutaneous vaccinations (2 ml per calf per vaccination), 4 and 7 weeks after arrival. on indication, the rectal temperature was measured. on indication, the veterinarian inspected the calves and eventually initiated treatment with antibiotics. paired serum samples were tested for antibodies against BCV and PI-3. no adverse effects were seen in any of the calves in the 2 herds following vaccination. in both herds, severe outbreaks of respiratory disease started in 1998. virological and serological findings in vaccinated calves during acute outbreak of respiratory disease in herd A (a) and herd B (b) none of the calves showed rise in PI-3 specific antibodies. paired serum samples were taken at the acute phase and one month later (18/19 Feb) the results of the virological and serological analysis are detailed in table 1b. no virus specific antigen was detected in nasal swabs from any of the 10 sampled animals. 5 of the 10 calves died. paired serum samples were available from only 5 calves. four of the 10 tested calves had IgM and/or IgA antibodies. 3 out of 5 calves had low levels of IgA one month later. histological examinations revealed a fibrinous-necrotizing pneumonia in 2 cases. the remaining three cases were diagnosed as suppurative bronchopneumonias. the calf died between the two sampling dates. the lungs were examined macroscopic and microscopic and samples were tested for the presence of the lungs. the lungs were examined macroscopic and microscopic. animal ID Virus Bacteria Mycoplasm Histopathology 1408 Negative M. haemolytica U. diversum M. dispar Fibrino-necrotizing bronchopneumonia 2131 Negative M. haemolytica U. diversum M. bovirhinis Fibrino-necrotizing bronchopneumonia. none of the tested calves had IgM or IgA antibodies against BRSV. 4 out of 8 calves had moderate levels of IgA one month later. all surviving calves had significant titer rise in BRSV specific IgG1 and IgG2 antibodies. significant change in antibody titers were defined as either sero-conversion (from 0 to any titer) or at least four-fold rises. Dead: the calf died between the two sampling dates. the results of the virological and serological analysis are detailed in table 1b. no virus specific antigen was detected in nasal swabs from any of the 10 sampled animals. as 5 of the 10 calves died between the 2 sampling days, paired serum samples were available from only 5 calves. three out of 5 calves had significant rise in BCV specific antibodies. one seroconverted to PI-3 virus (titer 0 8) at necropsy, acute bronchopneumonia characterized by red consolidated tissue, interstitial edema and marked interstitial emphysema was observed. gA, IgG1, IgG2 isotypes) and neutralising antibodies (SNT), BCV (Ab) and PI-3 (Ab) were defined as either sero-conversion (from 0 to any titer) or at least four-fold rises. the lungs were examined macroscopic and microscopic and tested for the presence of bacteria, mycoplams and virus. samples were tested for the presence of bacteria, mycoplams and virus. BRSV antigen was detected in nasal swabs from 2 out of 10 sampled animals of which one died. none of the tested calves had IgM or IgA antibodies against BRSV at the first sampling day. 4 out of 8 calves had moderate levels of IgA one month later. serum samples were analysed for the presence of antibodies against BRSV (IgM, IgA, IgG1, IgG2 isotypes) and neutralising antibodies (SNT), BCV (Ab) and PI-3 (Ab) significant change in antibody titers were defined as either sero-conversion (from 0 to any titer) or at least four-fold rises.

BRSV was involved, and probably initiated, both outbreaks of BRD despite prior vaccination with an inactivated BRSV vaccine."}
