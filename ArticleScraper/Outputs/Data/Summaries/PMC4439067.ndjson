{"summary": "study describes the economic burden on patients with tuberculosis. identifies related factors by comparing two areas with different management models. a total of 590 patients were interviewed with a response rate of 81%. china has the world's second largest tuberculosis epidemic, accounting for 12% of the total number of cases. the rising multidrug-resistant tuberculosis is increasing an already heavy burden on china\u2019s health system. each year in china, more than 1 million tuberculosis patients receive DOTS therapy. the free-service policy was only performed for sputum smear-positive patients. now it has expanded to sputum smear-negative patients. the government has taken more measures to reduce the patient burden. tuberculosis diagnosis and treatment is integrated into a general hospital. the integrated model is similar to the dispensary model, but a specialized hospital is also responsible for treating the patients. the study describes the economic burden on patients with tuberculosis. first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs, four liver function tests, three chest X-ray examinations and all sputum smear microscopy tests. each patient could receive a reimbursement of 150 CNY for liver protection drugs. each migrant patient with tuberculosis could receive an additional subsidy of 120 CNY. erculosis management models in TX recruited patients were limited to those who had finished anti-tuberculosis treatment prior to 2012. a total of 590 patients (316 patients from ZJG and 274 patients from TX) were successfully interviewed and involved in the analysis with a response rate of 81%. indirect costs depended on daily income; the number of sick leaves; the average daily income of each patient's companion; and the duration of absence from work resulting from nursing and caring for the patient. in 2010, the per capita GDP was 129535 Chinese Yuan (CNY) in ZJG. in the same year, the per capita GDP was 30567 CNY in china. tuberculosis patients are diagnosed and treated at the local CDC (tuberculosis dispensary) each patient could receive a reimbursement of 150 CNY for liver protection drugs. three hundred and forty patients who were diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis since January 2010 were recruited for the investigation. patients with pulmonary tuberculosis since January 2010 were excluded from the study. the hospitalization cost of the patients was computed based on the cost they paid when being discharged from the hospital. indirect costs depended on daily income; the number of sick leaves; the average daily income of each patient's companion; and the duration of absence from work resulting from nursing. 316 (53.6%) resided in ZJG, and 274 (46.4%) resided in TX. proportion of hospitalized patients and patients taking liver protective drugs was also higher in ZJG than TX. the median (IQR) ratio of total out-of-pocket cost to the annual family income was 20.5% (7.5%-58.7%) in ZJG and 5639.2 CNY in TX. the median (IQR) ratio of total out-of-pocket cost to the annual family income was 20.5% (7.5%-58.7%) in ZJG and 10.3% (3.9%-31.2%) in TX. 3.1 200(100\u2013400) 1.79 0.074 Accommodation and food 837.1 100(0\u2013800) 165.2 0(0\u20130) 10.60 0.001 Out-of-pocket direct costs 7448.0 3315(1200\u20138570) 3024.0 1086(480\u20132456) 9.768 0.001 Outpatient 2551.0 1100(500\u20133000) 1219.0 700(300\u20131245) 5.45 0.001 Hospitalization 3423.4 0(0 in TX, the indirect costs averaged 2615.2 CNY [median (IQR): 500 (250\u20132025)], including the productivity loss by patients (mean: 2151, median: 250, IQR:150\u20131500) Factors contributing to the total out-of-pocket costs in these two areas were diagnosis delay, hospitalization, and intake of liver protective drugs and second-line drugs. 61 310 2133(888\u20135700) 0.316 0.752 Migrant patient 125 6518(3030\u201316400) 6 2280(2050\u20132750) Sputum smear test Positive 102 5999(2900\u201315350) 0.972 0.331 182 2474(1045\u20136150) 1.803 0.071 Negative 172 8650(2340\u201320100) 134 1663(730\u20135400) treatment history Yes 21 significant factors related to total out-of-pocket costs were study setting (t = -3.10, P = 0.002), age (t = -4.04, P 0.001), number of clinical visits (t = 4.46, P 0.001), residence (t = 3.19, P = 0.002), diagnosis delay (t = 3.47, P = 0.001), intake of liver protective drugs (t = 2.78, P = 0.006) and intake of second-line drugs (t = 2.87, Migrant patient 0.433 0.166, 0.700 3.19 0.002 Diagnosis delay 2 weeks Ref. 2 weeks 0.341 0.148, 0.700 3.19 0.001 Hospitalization No Ref.

Table 6. Multivariate linear regression analysis on factors related to the total out-of-pocket costs stratified by study setting*. the government pays sustainable funds per person for the prevention of disease. most patients complain about paying a major part of the treatment cost through out of pocket payments. the integrated tuberculosis management model can shorten the delay time of diagnosis and treatment. clinical doctors in china usually prescribe protective drugs. these drugs include herbals, manufactured herbal products, and combinations of vitamins and other non-herbal substances. over-prescription of these medications also increases the patients\u2019 out-of-pocket costs. a significant interaction was found between clinical visits and study setting. the number of clinical visits was more important in TX as compared with ZJG. the relatively small sample size in ZJG may reduce statistical power. the financial burden remains heavy on tuberculosis patients. policy makers need to consider appropriate steps to lessen the burden of out-of-pocket costs."}
