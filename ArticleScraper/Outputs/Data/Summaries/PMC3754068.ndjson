{"summary": "as of 7 June 2013, 55 cases have been laboratory confirmed. as with SARS-CoV, patients affected by the virus suffer from severe and often lethal lower respiratory tract infection. a number of reported clusters indicate limited human-to-human spread. the known RBD in the S1 subunit of the MHV and SARS-CoV S proteins and their homologous regions in MERS-CoV S are indicated. the border between the S1 and S2 subunits of the S protein is represented by a vertical white line. binding to the C-terminal 300 amino acids of the spike protein (11, 12) and binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor (13) maps to residues 323 to 502 of S1 (14, 15) the RBD is the most important target of neutralizing antibodies (11, 16, 17), preventing virus-receptor interaction. a soluble form of human DPP4 (residues 39 to 766) was made that was C terminally tagged with the Fc region. these proteins were expressed in HEK-293T cells after transfection of the respective expression plasmids. the Fc region of purified soluble DPP4 (sDPP4)-Fc was proteolytically removed with trypsin. isolated by protein A-Sepharose affinity, stained with GelCodeBlue reagent. the positions of the S1-Fc proteins and sDPP4 are indicated. individual proteins were loaded as controls. a representative experiment was carried out twice, and the data from a representative experiment are shown. Error bars indicate the standard errors of the means. the experiment was carried out twice, and the data from a representative experiment are shown. encompassing residues 1 to 747 and 358 to 588, but not the residue 1-to-357 S1-Fc variant, inhibited infection. polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits against the 1-to-747, 1-to-357, and 358-to-588 S1-Fc variants. this indicates that neutralizing epitopes within S1 are localized primarily in the RBD region. the RBD in the MERS-CoV S1 protein localizes in the same region where the SARS-CoV S protein interacts with its ACE2 receptor (25). compared to SARS-CoV, the RBD contains a relatively conserved core domain but a highly variable loop region, tentatively explaining the differential receptor usage (25). MHV, V, and MHV have been confirmed by crystallography. gray boxes indicate the transmembrane domains."}
