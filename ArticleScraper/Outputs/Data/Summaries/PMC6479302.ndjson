{"summary": "the majority of the global human population is latently infected with HCMV. the seroprevalence of a given group depends on the age, gender, and socioeconomic status of its members. HCMV inevitably establishes a state of life-long latency, causing recurrent episodes of virus shedding. HCMV co-infections are associated with enhanced HIV progression and early-onset of age-related diseases. the most dangerous constellation is the presence of HCMV infection in the absence of HCMV-specific immune cells. HCMV is classified as one of the so-called TORCH infections (toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, and other organisms including syphilis, parvovirus, Zika, and Varicella HCMV is an enveloped virus with an icosahedral capsid with a 235 kbp double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) genome. the genome is composed of a unique long (UL) and a unique short (US) region. the nucleoside analogues Ganciclovir (GCV) and its oral prodrug Valganciclovir exhibit side-effects including hematologic toxicity manifest as leukopenia, neutropenia, anemia, or thrombocytopenia. a lipid-conjugated form of Cidofovir was developed under the name Brincidofovir (CMX001) the pUL97-specific kinase inhibitor Maribavir stimulated great expectations in the field [27] there may be a beneficial effect of Maribavir treatment for HCMV infections refractory or resistant to (Val-) Ganciclovir, Foscarnet, and Cidofovir. the nucleoside analogues Ganciclovir (GCV) and its oral prodrug Valganciclovir exhibit side-effects including hematologic toxicity manifest as leukopenia, neutropenia, anemia, or thrombocytopenia [20]. a lipid-conjugated form of Cidofovir was developed under the name Brincidofovir (CMX001) the pUL97-specific kinase inhibitor Maribavir stimulated great expectations in the field. it did not reach the primary endpoint to reduce HCMV-associated diseases in a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, multicenter phase three study in recipients of stem-cell transplantation. janus kinases (Jak) secreted IFNs to their cell surface receptors. signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins engaged. tyrosine phosphorylation activates STATs. the use of IFNs is declining with the development of effective direct acting antiviral drugs, e.g., against hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the case of HCMV, IFNs are not used as antiviral drugs. Ubiquitination is a concerted and stepwise process, catalyzed by successive activities of a Ub-activating enzyme (\u2018E1\u2032), a Ub-conjugating enzyme (\u2018E2\u2032), and a Ub ligase (\u2018E3\u2032) the human genome encodes only a handful of enzymes with E1 activity [50,51], around 40 E2 enzymes, and several hundred E3 ligases. the exact Ub code is far from being solved, but it is clear that certain types of ubiquitination are mostly associated with defined down-stream events. the proteasome is a large multi-protein protease complex [57] usually composed of the 19S regulatory lid-like particle and the barrel-like 20S core particle. subunits Rpn1, Rpn10, and Rpn13 recognize ubiquitinated proteins targeted for proteasomal degradation. target protein becomes partially unfolded and deubiquitinated in order to fit into the core. proteasome can be inhibited by several different compounds. Cullin RING Ubiquitin ligases (CRLs) and their Regulation by Nedd8 Conjugation Ub ligases are divided into three classes. RING and U-box E3 ligases act as adaptor proteins, whereas HECT E3 ligases transiently accept and bind the Ub. the first-in-class inhibitor MLN4924 (also called Pevonedistat) takes advantage of a regulation mechanism. the cullin protein is conjugated with the molecule Nedd8 in a process called neddylation. neddylation is a three-step process executed by a specific set of E1, E2, and E3 enzymes. DDB1-Cullin 4A/B-RocA Complexes As indicated by its name, DDB1 was initially identified as one of two components of the UV-DNA damage-binding complex. later it turned out that DDB1 is an important adapter protein for Cullin 4A (Cul4A) and Cullin 4B (Cul4B) DDB1 is an essential protein conserved from yeasts to humans. in mice, a null mutation results in embryonic lethality, while organ-specific deletions are associated with a loss of the respective tissue. in vitro, cells also die upon DDB1 ablation. the MCMV-encoded protein pM27 does not affect the MCMV replication in IFN-nave fibroblasts in cell culture. the severe attenuation associated with the lack of M27 results from the inability to counteract STAT2-dependent signaling. pM27 interferes with STAT2-dependent IFN signaling. pM27 only affects IFN induction indirectly in cell types. phenotype of the deletion virus can be reverted by addition of pharmacologic inhibitors of IFN-Jak-STAT signaling. inhibition of Nedd8 conjugation by MLN4924 counteracts CRL activity [71] and restores STAT2 levels in the presence of pM27. pE27 interacts with DDB1 and Cul4A/B, while pR27 only weakly interacts with DDB1 and Cul4B. pUL27 is dispensable for the HCMV-mediated STAT2 degradation. the deletion of the gene UL35 severely affects HCMV replication in cell culture. the two pUL35 isoforms physically interact with each other, with other viral proteins, and with several host proteins. pUL35 and pp71-pUL82 are functionally relevant for modulating the activity of the viral major immediate early promoter. pUL145 is highly conserved among different HCMV strains. the UL145 gene gives rise to monocistronic as well as polycistronic transcripts. pUL145 is responsible for a proteasomal degradation of HLTF. pUL145 assembles a functional CRL complex to degrade the host restriction factor HLTF very early during HCMV infection. HCMV-induced degradation of HLTF was found to be sensitive to MG132. these data highlight HLTF as an important host restriction factor. pM27 interferes with STAT2-dependent IFN signaling. pM27 only affects IFN induction indirectly in cell types. phenotype of the deletion virus can be reverted by addition of pharmacologic inhibitors of IFN-Jak-STAT signaling. inhibition of Nedd8 conjugation by MLN4924 counteracts CRL activity [71] and restores STAT2 levels in the presence of pM27. pE27 interacts with DDB1 and Cul4A/B, while pR27 only weakly interacts with DDB1 and Cul4B. pUL27 is dispensable for the HCMV-mediated STAT2 degradation. the protein p75-UL35 is a component of the virion. the deletion of the gene UL35 severely affects HCMV replication in cell culture. pUL35 and pp71-pUL82 interact with host proteins. pUL145 is highly conserved among different HCMV strains. the UL145 gene gives rise to monocistronic as well as polycistronic transcripts. this suggests its relevance for viral replication as well as the conservation of its interaction partner(s) pUL145 deletion virus lost the capacity to downregulate the HLTF protein levels. pUL145 assembles a functional CRL complex to degrade the host restriction factor HLTF very early during HCMV infection. HCMV-induced degradation of HLTF was found to be sensitive to MG132. the barrier for resistance mutations to occur is far higher in the case of IAAs. targeting host proteins is more likely to cause cytotoxicity. this is consistent with the finding that viral proteins preferentially target cellular hub and bottleneck proteins. the FDA for the treatment of myelomas [153,154] is using treatment regimens with alternating phases of drug administration followed by drug-free recovery intervals. the exaggerated proteasome-dependency of tumor cells is exploited to outweigh detrimental effects on healthy cells. however, proliferation is essential for various aspects of effective immune responses. MLN4924 has profound anti-tumor activity against acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in cell culture models, primary patient specimens, and in animal xenograft models. a phase III study is currently recruiting participants. the most common side-effects observed in a phase I trial were fatigue and nausea, and 15% reported adverse events. MLN4924 has profound anti-tumor activity against acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in cell culture models, primary patient specimens, and in animal xenograft models. a phase III study is currently recruiting participants. the UPS and CRLs regulate the abundance of numerous proteins. up to 19,000 sites in 5000 proteins are ubiquitinated. the abundance of >80% of all proteins increases upon blockade of the proteasome. if the antiviral activity is defined by a binding interface present in a cellular protein, viral resistance should be rather difficult to achieve. toxicity should also be limited if the cellular functions of the CRL are largely retained."}
