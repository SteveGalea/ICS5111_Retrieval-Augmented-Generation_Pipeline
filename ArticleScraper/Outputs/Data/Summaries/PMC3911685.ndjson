{"summary": "hantaviruses are negative-strand, single-stranded RNA viruses with three segments, denoted small (S), medium (M), and large (L) Hantaviruses predominantly infect microvascular endothelial cells and create a vascular leakage-based disease by altering the barrier properties of the endothelium (5). the lack of disease associated with hamster infection with the aforementioned hantaviruses, except ANDV, limits our understanding of the pathogenesis of these viruses. development of disease models for these viruses is an important step to expand the capability of evaluating potential therapeutics for hantavirus disease. hantavirus strain CC107 (23) was propagated in vero E6 cells. cells were maintained in Eagle's minimum essential medium with salts containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, penicillin-streptomycin and cyclophosphamide monohydrate. blood samples were collected in lithium heparin capillary blood collection tubes. concentrations of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were determined using a comprehensive metabolic reagent disc and an abaxis Piccolo xpress chemistry analyzer. real-time PCR was conducted on a bio-Rad CFX thermal cycler using an invitrogen Power SYBR green RNA-to-CT one-step kit according to the manufacturer's protocols. tissues were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, trimmed, processed, embedded in paraffin, cut at 5 to 6 m. slides were rinsed, and a substrate-chromogen solution (3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine; Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) was applied for 30 min. the slides were stained with hematoxylin and rinsed. survival curves were compared with Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. 107 (23) was propagated in vero E6 cells (Vero C1008, ATCC CRL 1586) cells were maintained in Eagle's minimum essential medium with Earle's salts containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 1, and gentamicin sulfate (50 g/ml) at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 incubator blood samples collected in lithium heparin capillary blood collection tubes were analyzed using an Advia 120 hematology analyzer. the dog setting was used for the complete blood count (CBC) and the guinea pig setting was used for the differential. cycling conditions were 30 min at 48\u00b0C, 10 min at 95\u00b0C, and 40 cycles of 15 s at 95\u00b0C and 1 min at 60\u00b0C. Tissues were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, trimmed, processed, embedded in paraffin, cut at 5 to 6 m. the substrate-chromogen solution was rinsed off the slides. the slides were stained with hematoxylin and rinsed. survival curves were compared with Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. the combination of dexamethasone and cyclophosphamide elicited the most immunosuppressive activity of the three treatment groups. the combination of dexamethasone and cyclophosphamide also resulted in consistently reduced lymphocyte counts. x 16 (3), 8 (2, 1) 4 (0\u201313) CyP 140 (3) 100 (1, 1, 4, 7, 10, 13) No treatment NA NA a Dexamethasone (Dex) and cyclophosphamide (CyP) were administered by i.p. injection. groups of 3 hamsters were treated with dexamethasone and cyclophosphamide, alone or in combination. hamsters in the cyclophosphamide-treated and dexamethasone/cyclophosphamide-treated groups displayed clinical signs including staggered gait, tachypnea, dyspnea, lethargy, and severe pulmonary edema. clinical signs of disease were not observed in any surviving hamster. dexamethasone/cyclophosphamide immunosuppression allows SNV to be uniformly lethal in hamsters. groups of 8 hamsters were treated with dexamethasone and cyclophosphamide, alone or in combination, according to the schedule outlined in Table 1. in the lung, slightly higher levels of viral genome were detected in immunosuppressed hamsters than in immunocompetent hamsters. but there was a statistically significant increase in infectious virus in the cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone/cyclophosphamide hamster groups compared to untreated controls. xamethasone/cyclophosphamide-treated hamster lungs showed interstitial inflammation and vascular leakage consistent with changes normally seen in hamsters infected with ANDV. immunohistochemistry performed on lung sections from each of the treatment groups showed widespread immunoreactivity in the alveolar septa and endothelial cells of larger vessels. hamsters in the untreated, SNV-infected group showed scattered, minimal immunoreactivity of inf images were acquired at a magnification of 20 (inset magnification, 40). despite repeated serial passaging of SNV through hamsters does not increase its pathogenicity in immunocompetent hamsters. to this end, 2,000 PFU of SNV isolated from a dexamethasone/cyclophosphamide-treated, SNV-infected hamster was used to infect immunocompetent hamsters. these hamsters all hamsters not receiving -SNV antibodies developed disease and succumbed 12 to 13 days postchallenge. 3 hamsters either succumbed or were euthanized on days 17 to 18. the remaining 5 hamsters survived to day 28 (P = 0.0001) dexamethasone and cyclophosphamide, alone and in combination, resulted in statistically significant reductions in WBC counts compared to no-treatment controls. combination of dexamethasone and cyclophosphamide elicited the most immunosuppressive activity of the three treatment groups. dexamethasone and cyclophosphamide immunosuppress Syrian hamsters without toxicity. group of 3 hamsters were treated with dexamethasone and cyclophosphamide, alone or in combination, according to the schedule outlined in Table 1. hamide-treated and dexamethasone/cyclophosphamide-treated groups displayed clinical signs including staggered gait, tachypnea, dyspnea, lethargy, and severe pulmonary edema. clinical signs of disease were not observed in any surviving hamster. half of the hamsters receiving cyclophosphamide alone developed HPS approximately 16 days postchallenge, with a range of 12 to 19 ide immunosuppression allows SNV to be uniformly lethal in hamsters. groups of 8 hamsters were treated with dexamethasone and cyclophosphamide. hamsters were challenged with 2,000 PFU SNV i.m. on day 0. levels of viral genome were detected in immunosuppressed hamsters. however, there was a statistically significant increase in infectious virus in the cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone/cyclophosphamide hamster groups compared to untreated controls. immunohistochemistry performed on lung sections from each treatment group showed widespread immunoreactivity in the alveolar septa and endothelial cells of larger vessels. hamsters in the untreated, SNV-infected group showed scattered, minimal immunoreactivity of infected endothelial cells, a finding consistent with previous results. images were acquired at a magnification of 20 (inset magnification, 40). despite the fact that repeated serial passaging of SNV through hamsters does not increase its pathogenicity in immunocompetent hamsters. to this end, 2,000 PFU of SNV isolated from the pleural effluent of a dexamethasone/cyclophosphamide-treated, SNV-infected hamster was used to infect immunocompeten not receiving -SNV antibodies developed disease and succumbed 12 to 13 days postchallenge. 3 hamsters either succumbed or were euthanized on days 17 to 18. the remaining 5 hamsters survived to day 28 (P = 0.0001) both SNV and ANDV are new world hantaviruses that cause HPS in humans. the kinetics and pathology of SNV in an immunocompromised hamster and ANDV in an immunocompetent hamster are remarkably similar. viremia can be detected in immunocompromised, SNV-infected hamsters. gment RNA copies were detected in lung tissue 10 days postinfection in hamsters treated with dexamethasone, cyclophosphamide, or the combination. however, only hamsters receiving cyclophosphamide showed signs of pathology. this may suggest certain components of the cellular immune response regulate pathogenesis following SNV infection. treatment of animals with cyclophosphamide did not result in increased neutrophil numbers compared to untreated animals. dexamethasone is a glucocorticosteroid which can downregulate proinflammatory cytokine expression, induce anti-inflammatory cytokines and proliferation, and induce apoptosis in multiple cell types. dexamethasone delays or even prevents neutrophil apoptosis. this is due in part to the stabilization of the anti-apoptotic Mcl-1L protein (55) dexamethasone-treated animals did not exhibit a more significant decrease in neutrophil numbers. the presence of dexamethasone at the time of challenge may allow the virus a better opportunity to replicate and disseminate by reducing both innately (e.g., skeletal muscle, smooth muscle, and endothelial cells) derived and cellularly (e.g., dendritic cells, NK cells, neutrophils) derived sources of type I interferon are important in early clearance of SNV in immunocompetent hamsters. hantavirus-specific T cells are found in human HPS cases (6, 66, 67) lymphocyte numbers are significantly reduced in animals treated with the combination of cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone. cyclophosphamide treatment of ANDV-infected hamsters significantly reduced the number of T cells in the blood and lungs of hamsters. the dexamethasone/cyclophosphamide approach described here differs from the use of transgenic knockout animals with defective innate and/or adaptive immune systems. immunosuppression is transient and can be restored upon cessation of treatment. it will be of interest to determine whether this same approach can be used to develop disease models for hantaviruses that cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome."}
