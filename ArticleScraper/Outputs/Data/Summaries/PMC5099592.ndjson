{"summary": "MERS-CoV was first isolated from a patient in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 2012. MEDLINE and PubMed searched for the keywords: Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus, MERS-CoV, pediatric, children, childhood, infancy and pregnancy. despite increased number overtime and multiple health care associated outbreaks, the number of pediatric cases remained low during the study period[18]. the initial description of 47 cases included only a 14-year-old child[4]. the largest report of childhood MERS-CoV cases included eleven, of which two patients were symptomatic and nine were asymptomatic[18]. statistical review of the study was performed by a biomedical statistician. of all the cases, thirteen (13) or 42% were asymptomatic. there were 17 males, 10 females and 4 unreported (a male to female ratio of 1.7:1). female KSA Family contact 2014 Asymptomatic None none NPS 37 ND No No [18] 3 Female KSA Family contact 2013 Asymptomatic None none NPS 38 ND No No [18] 13 Female KSA Contact 2014 Asymptomatic None none NPS 36 ND No No [18] 0.75 Male KSA Not known 2014 ICU Nephrotic syndrome Respiratory distress Tracheal aspirate NA Diffuse bilateral haziness Yes Yes [35] 4 Male KSA NA 2013 Mild respiratory symptoms None NA rRT-PCR Screening of pediatric patients for MERS-CoV infection using real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction showed that only 9 out of 552 (1.6%) were positive in KSA[23]. the effect of MERS-CoV infection on the fetus was described in eight cases. the mean age of the mothers was 32.25 + 3.4 years. the mean gestational age was 28.4 + 6.3 wk. about one half of the cases were reported in 2014, and 29% were reported in 2013 and 22.6% in 2015 (Table 2). About one half of the cases were reported in 2014, and 29% were reported in 2013 and 22.6% in 2015.
