Statistical analysis Data were analyzed using SPSS version 21.0 statistical software. participants with >5 years of clinical experience had statistically significant knowledge score 6.22.3 which was even higher as compared to participants with 5 years 5.52.5. participants with >3 years of clinical experience at the tertiary care hospital had significantly higher knowledge score compared to participants with 3 years 7.11.5 versus 5.72.4. the 3 highest MeanSD familiarity scores for EPIQ were achieved by \u201cethical issues in triage\u201d 3.91.1, followed by \u201cemergency preparedness terms and activities\u201d 3.80.8 and \u201cdecontamination\u201d 3.71.1. the dimension that attained the lowest MeanSD familiarity score for EPIQ was \u201caccessing critical resources and reporting\u201d 3.11.1. attitudes towards disaster and emergency preparedness Table 2 demonstrates participants agreement regarding disaster and emergency preparedness. around 12 (6.3%) participants were not interested in being aware of the emergency (disaster) operational plans, and approximately 21 (11%) agreed that disaster management and planning is for a few people in the hospital. 66 (34.9%) participants believed disasters are unlikely to happen in their hospital. physicians and nurses revealed a satisfactory level of knowledge in disaster preparedness 6.22.5. most of the participants expressed their positive attitude towards disaster management. only 8 (12.7%) disagreed to the need of frequent disaster simulations in the hospital.
