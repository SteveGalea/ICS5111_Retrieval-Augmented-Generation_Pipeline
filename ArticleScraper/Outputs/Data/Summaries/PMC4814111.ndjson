{"summary": "Coronaviruses have a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome. they are classified into four genera of alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and deltacoronaviruses. this propensity has contributed to the existing diversity of coronaviruses. a small portion of cats develop FIP during the course of FECV infection and succumb to the disease. a small portion of cats develop FIP during the course of FECV infection and succumb to the disease. studies support that FIP arises in individual cats through mutation of the virus to gain tropism for macrophages. lymphopenia associated with massive apoptosis of uninfected T-cells is a prominent feature of both experimental and natural FIP [11, 17, 21, 22] and implicated with cytokines secreted by the virus-infected macrophages and other immune cells. fatality to FIP is virtually 100% [17, 23\u201325] and the median survival time from the time of diagnosis to death is about 8\u20139 days [23, 24]. GC376 is a 3CLpro inhibitor which is previously reported to be active against the 3CLpro of multiple coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV [28] but with highest potency against FIPV in cell culture. antiviral treatment caused a rapid reversal of clinical signs and lymphopenia and reduction in viral titers. active infection was no longer apparent after 14\u201320 days of antiviral treatment. treated cats have remained normal under observation for as long as eight months. a 3CLpro inhibitor is effective at reversing disease progression. dehyde forms of GC376 or NPI64 were measured in the plasma samples. GC376 is rapidly absorbed after s.c. administration and plasma level reached within 2 hr after injection. plasma drug concentrations following injection of 5 mg/kg NPI64 remained above EC50 value for 18 hrs post injection. GC376 and NPI64 are readily converted into aldehyde forms in the blood. the red triangles and black circles indicate the plasma concentrations of the aldehyde forms of GC376 and NPI64, respectively. in the safety study, four healthy SPF cats were subcutaneously given GC376 at 10 mg/kg/dose daily at 9 AM and 5 PM for 4 weeks. plasma drug concentrations at 16 hr post administration were determined from blood collected immediately before next drug administration. highest determined drug concentrations were well below the EC50 value which is greater than 150 M in cell culture. experimental infection of cats with serotype I FIPV that induce wet FIP has been reported previously [12, 17, 34] eight cats from both studies developed jaundice, inapparent to profound ascites, absolute lymphopenia (134676/l, reference range 1,200 to 8,000/l) and high fever (up to 41.1\u00b0C) all six remaining cats showed rapid improvement in attitude and resolution of fever. all cats that received antiviral treatment for 14\u201320 days appeared normal by clinical observation and laboratory testing. the six recovered cats from both studies have remained healthy showing no signs of relapse during an observation period up to 8 months. arrows and forward slashes indicate antiviral treatment duration and euthanasia, respectively. colored arrows located between panels B and D indicate treatment duration for each cat. antiviral treatment significantly reduced viral load in cats with FIP. was 1,595.7 in P15 that received 4 day-antiviral treatment. was 171,755.9 in P16 that received 7 day-antiviral treatment. reduction in viral RNA levels in P15 and P16 seems to correlate with necropsy findings of mild or no FIP lesions in those cats. a decrease in antiviral activity of GC376 against FIPV was not observed at up to 20 passages. GC376 effectively inhibited the replication of NPI52-resistant viruses in cell culture as wild-type viruses, indicating that the mutation does not confer cross-resistance to GC376. 3CLpro of TGEV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV have low amino acid sequence identity of about 50%. activity of GC376 against 3CLpro of various coronaviruses in a fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay is unknown. GC376 is converted into an aldehyde form by the removal of the bisulfite group. the aldehyde form forms a reversible covalent bond with the nucleophilic cysteine residue of 3CLpro. the PK study results indicate that GC376 is rapidly absorbed after s.c. administration. the maximum detected plasma drug concentration following NPI64 administration was substantially lower than that of GC376 by 9.5-fold. GC376 was more easily absorbed than NPI64 via the tested route, even when the lower dose of NPI64 (5 mg/kg), compared to GC376 (10 mg/kg), was taken into account. plasma drug concentrations were measured at 2 and 16 hr post-injection. the dotted red line indicates the EC50 value of GC376. the 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) value of GC376 (>150 M) is greater than the dotted blue line. serotype I FIPV is responsible for the majority (80\u201390%) of naturally-occurring FIP. an absolute lymphopenia, fever, weight loss, jaundice and inapparent to mild ascites appear within 2\u20133 weeks after infection. all the cats that develop lymphopenia and clinical signs following experimental infection do not spontaneously recover but succumb to the disease. the eight cats from both studies developed jaundice, inapparent to profound ascites, absolute lymphopenia (134676/l, reference range 1,200 to 8,000/l) before antiviral treatment was started. they also lost body weight up to 13.6% of their pre-infection weight during this same period. antiviral treatment of symptomatic cats with FIP significantly reduced viral load in the cats with FIP. arrows and forward slashes indicate antiviral treatment duration and euthanasia, respectively. ascites rapidly decreased with antiviral treatment. we determined viral load in two cats prior to and during antiviral treatment. both cats had severe pancreatitis, a possible complication of meloxicam treatment, but no lesions or mild lesions typical of FIP were found. GC376 can effectively reduce the virus load in the macrophages from the ascites and the omentum of cats with FIP. changes in the viral RNA levels in P15 and P16 before and during antiviral treatment are shown. of GC376 against FIPV was not observed at up to 20 passages. a single mutation of serine to cysteine at the position of 131. GC376 effectively inhibited the replication of NPI52-resistant viruses in cell culture as wild-type viruses. the results are summarized in Fig 5. Activity of GC376 against 3CLpro of various coronaviruses in a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay. the upper graph shows the percent activity of GC376 against 3CLpro of FIPV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV in the presence of GC376, determined by a FRET assay. the lack of potent antiviral compounds against coronaviruses has made it difficult to investigate the effects of antiviral treatment in animals with lethal coronavirus infection. our 3CLpro inhibitors were previously reported to be potent against FIPV in the in vitro assays [28, 30] but have not been tested in cats. GC376 is active against the 3CLpro of coronaviruses belonging to alphacoronavirus (FIPV) or the multiple clades in betacoronavirus (MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV) despite the low sequence identity of 3CLpro among FIPV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. a majority of reported protease inhibitors that are shown to have inhibitory effects against various coronaviruses in GC376, a dipeptidyl compound, consists of a warhead, a Gln surrogate structure in a position that corresponds to the P1 position, Leu in the P2 position and a cap structure. GC376, a tripeptidyl compound, has homologous structural elements with GC376, except that NPI52 has an additional residue of 1-naththylalanine. the 3CLpro gene of NPI52-resistant virus has a single mutation of S131C. this mutation located between the cII and dII strands in the domain II. the role of this mutation in the 3CLpro in conferring resistance to NPI52 is not clear. however, the fact that serine at this position is conserved among all feline coronaviruses whose sequences are available. a representative compound, GC376, of our dipeptidyl 3CLpro inhibitor series was shown to be safe by the dosage regimen used in cats. this compound may have the potential to be developed into a safe and effective drug for FIP. the results suggest similar intervention approaches targeting virally-encoded 3CLpro warrant investigation for other existing and emerging coronavirus infections. four healthy SPF cats of 6\u20139 months of age were injected s.c. with a daily dose of GC376 (10 mg/kg/dose dissolved in 10% EtOH, 50% PEG400 and 40% PBS) plasma samples were prepared for determination of drug concentrations at 2 or 16 hrs (immediately before the next dose) P03 and P07 were given GC376 at 5 mg/kg/dose for 4 or 8 days. all other cats received GC376 at 10 mg/kg/dose during antiviral treatment. animals were observed daily for clinical signs and body weight. the omentum using RNeasy mini kit (Life Technologies) and real-time qRT-PCR was conducted. the primers and a probe targeting the 3\u2019-UTR region of FIPV are 5\u2019-GGAGGTACAAGCAACCCTATT-3\u2019 (a forward primer), 5\u2019-GATCCAGACGTTAGCT CTTCC-3\u2019 (a reverse primer) and FAM-AGATCCGCTATGACGAGCCAACAA-Iowa Black (a probe) dilutions of GC376 or NPI52 were added to confluent monolayers of CRFK cells in 24-well plates or cells were mock-treated. cells were immediately infected with NPI52-resistant virus at an MOI of 0.05\u20131. expression and purification of each 3CLpro were conducted following standard method described previously by our group. FRET assay was performed using a fluorogenic substrate (dabcyl-KTSAVLQ/SGFRKME-edans) derived from the cleavage sites on viral polyproteins of SARS-CoV. 3CLpro of FIPV, MERS-CoV, or SARS-CoV were incubated with GC376 for 30 min and the edans/dabcyl FRET substrate derived from the clea two healthy SPF cats of 6\u20139 months of age were subcutaneously injected with 10 mg/kg GC376 or 5 mg/kg NPI64 dissolved in 10% EtOH and 90% PEG400. blood samples were collected from each cat at 2, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 48 hrs following injection. four cats (P02, P03, P07 and P10) in the first study did not receive any medication other than GC376. five doses of oral or subcutaneous meloxicam at 0.3 mg/kg/dose (once a day) as well as fluids were given to four cats (P15, P16, P17 and P24) cell pellets were incubated with 500 l RNAlater (Life Technologies, NY, USA) for overnight at 4\u00b0C. samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 13,000 rpm to remove supernatant. tissues were stored at -70\u00b0C until analysis. cDNA encoding the full length 3CLpro of FIPV-m3c-2 was amplified by RT-PCR using the omentum tissue from the cats infected with FIPV-m3c-2. cDNA encoding the full length 3CLpro of FIPV-m3c-2 was amplified by RT-PCR. the expression and purification of each 3CLpro were conducted following a standard method described previously by our group [28, 30] method for FRET assay was performed using a fluorogenic substrate (dabcyl-KTSAVLQ/SGFRKME-edans) 3CLpro of FIPV, MERS-CoV, or SARS-CoV were incubated with GC376 for 30 min. the surface representation of the active sites of TGEV (PDB ID: 4F49) and MERS-CoV (PDB ID: 4WME) were created with PyMol (DeLano Scientific) [57]. Various blood chemistry values or blood cell counts over time are expressed as means and standard error of the means. the residue (S131) mutated in the 3CLpro of FIPV resistant to NPI52, an aldehyde form of NPI64, is shown in purple. the residues in the S1 and S2 pockets of MERS-CoV 3CLpro are shown in yellow."}
