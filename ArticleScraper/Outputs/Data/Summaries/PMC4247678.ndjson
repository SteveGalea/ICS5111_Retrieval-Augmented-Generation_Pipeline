{"summary": "systemic orbital fat-derived stem cell transplantation was effective in ameliorating lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced extensive acute lung injury (ALI) in vivo mainly through paracrine regulation of macrophage-mediated cytokine-storm. expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in macrophages were investigated. miR-671-5p was identified as a critical microRNA in regulation of multiple immune-modulating factors in OFSCs response to macrophages. down-regulation of miR-671-5p in OFSCs selectively enhanced the IL-1 RA and sTNF RII expression."}
