{"summary": "MERS-CoV was identified in patients with severe lower respiratory tract infections with almost 50% of cases resulting in lethal lower respiratory tract infections (1\u20135) there are no vaccines or effective therapies currently available for clinical cases of MERS-CoV infection. anti-CD26 polyclonal antibody (pAb) was used to inhibit in vitro MERS-CoV infection. pAbs to the MERS-CoV S1 domain effectively neutralize MERS-CoV infection (8). Fig. 2A, 2F9 inhibited full binding of MERS-CoV S1-Fc to JKT-hCD26WT. other anti-CD26 MAbs showed some inhibition (1F7 and YS110) or no significant inhibition (4G8, 16D4B, 9C11, and 14D10) the blocking effect of 2F9 was dose dependent. anti-CD26 MAb 2F9 has greater therapeutic potential than recombinant MERS-CoV S1-Fc to prevent viral entry into susceptible cells. anti-CD26 MAb 2F9 inhibits binding of MERS-CoV S1-Fc in parental Jurkat cells and CD26 Jurkat transfectants. mouse MAb 4G8, 1F7, 14D10, 2F9, 16D4B, or control IgG (black) for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. after being washed, cells were stained with Alexa Fluor 488-labeled MERS-CoV S1-Fc. results representative of three different experiments are shown as mean MFI. red bars at 0 g/ml of preincubated control IgG or anti-CD26 MAbs were plotted using the same data. the black and dark-gray bars at 0 g/ml of preincubated MERS-CoV S1-Fc or control Fc were plotted using the same data. the epitope of the anti-human CD26 MAb 2F9 was estimated to be located near the ADA binding region of CD26. the epitopes of the other anti-CD26 MAbs tested, including 1F7 and YS110, did not involve the ADA binding region (16). binding of exogenous ADA was detected on JKT-hCD26WT but not on CD26-negative parental Jurkat cells. MERS-CoV S1-Fc binding to JKT-hCD26-ADA was clearly observed at concentrations of 5 g/ml or greater. binding intensity appeared to be lower than that observed with JKT-hCD26WT (Fig. 1B), suggesting that the region where CD26 binds to MERS-CoV S1-Fc partially overlaps with its ADA binding regions. osine deaminase 1) in CD26 are involved in binding of MERS-CoV S1-Fc to human CD26. ADA was incubated with 10 g/ml of Alexa Fluor 488-labeled ADA or ADA2 as a fluorescence control. results representative of three different experiments shown as mean MFI. ADA2 or msIgG-488 as a fluorescence control. JKT-hCD26-ADA cells were stained with Alexa Fluor 488-labeled MERS-CoV S1-Fc (black) at the indicated concentrations. gray histograms show results for staining with Fc-488. the black and gray bars at 0 g/ml of preincubated ADA or vehicle were plotted using the same data. results representative of three different experiments are shown. binding efficiency was significantly decreased in comparison to that of the full-length human CD26 (Fig. 6a and black bars in graph) binding efficiency was significantly decreased in comparison with that of the full-length human CD26 (Fig. 6a and black bars in graph), which was at levels similar to those in mock-transfected cells. rat CD26 has been estimated not to bind to MERS-CoV. the full-length rat CD26 or rat-human swap mutant consisting of aa 1 to 739 of rat CD26 with aa 740 to 766 of human CD26 showed no binding to MERS-CoV S1-Fc, 2F9, or YS110. cDNAs with full-length human CD26 (a), the indicated deletion (b through f), human/rat swap mutants (h through j) or vector control (g) were cotransfected with GFP-expressing plasmids to COS-1 cells. TM indicates a transmembrane region of human CD26. amino acids (aa) derived from human (H) or rat (R) are represented in white or dark-gray boxes. 2F9 recognizes between 248 and 449 aa, including the ADA binding regions. 1F7 and YS110 recognize between 248 and 358 aa, excluding the ADA binding regions. humanized anti-CD26 MAb YS110 is being evaluated in patients with CD26-expressing cancers. no apparent adverse effects of YS110 have been reported besides the injection reaction. YS110 may be an immediate therapeutic candidate for clinical use. the humanized anti-CD26 MAb YS110 is ready for testing as a potential treatment for MERS-CoV infection in the present outbreaks."}
