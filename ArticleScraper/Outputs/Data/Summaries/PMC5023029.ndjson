{"summary": "eosinophils may have an underappreciated antiviral role in respiratory tract infections in humans. eosinophils may have an underappreciated antiviral role in respiratory tract infections in humans. mice were infected with parainfluenza (2.8 104 TCID50 Units) intranasally on day 27. lungs were lavaged and homogenized using real-time RT-PCR. eosinophils were inoculated with parainfluenza for 2 hours, washed to remove unbound virus, and maintained in fresh medium for 72 hours. RNA in culture supernatants was quantified every 24 hours by real-time RT-PCR and immunofluorescence. mice were sensitized by intraperitoneal injection with 0.04 g and 0.2 g ovalbumin. mice were anesthetized with ketamine (45 mg/kg) and xylazine (8 mg/kg) and challenged with intratracheal 2% ovalbumin. Viral infectivity was quantified in RMK cells by hemadsorption assay. infectious titers are expressed as TCID50 U/ml of culture supernatant. eosinophils were exposed to parainfluenza or synthetic TLR7 agonist. eosinophils promote parainfluenza Virus Clearance in the Lung In Vivo NJ.1726 mice (Eos IL-5) constitutively express IL-5 in the pulmonary epithelium and have elevated numbers of eosinophils in the lungs. eosinophil-deficient PHIL mice were congenitally devoid of eosinophils. parainfluenza RNA content in the lungs of IL-5 was similar to that in wild-type mice. eosinophil-deficient PHIL mice alone had parainfluenza RNA levels comparable to infected wild-type mice. NJ.1726 mice (Eos IL-5) had significantly reduced parainfluenza RNA compared with control mice (WT) no eosinophils were detected in the bronchoalveolar lavage in PHIL (Eos) or NJ.1726-PHIL mice (Eos IL-5) Sensitized and challenged wild-type and eosinophil peroxidase\u2013deficient mice had significantly elevated airway eosinophils relative to nonsensitized wild-type and eosinophil peroxidase\u2013deficient mice. parainfluenza RNA from eosinophil supernatants was quantified by real-time RT-PCR every 24 hours. the virus is capable of infecting eosinophils and producing viral transcripts. despite replication, the parainfluenza virus titers remained undetectable at these time points. eosinophils significantly decreased parainfluenza virus titers compared with virus-inoculated cultures without eosinophils. eosinophils significantly decreased parainfluenza virus titers compared with virus-inoculated cultures without eosinophils. fusion, nucleoprotein (NP) were quantified in eosinophil supernatants by real-time RT-PCR 2 hours after inoculation. no differences were detected between any of the three genes, suggesting that the reduction in parainfluenza infectivity was not due to viral RNA degradation by eosinophil granule RNases. l-NAME treatment prevented parainfluenza-induced nitric oxide production by eosinophils. l-NAME treatment prevented parainfluenza-induced nitric oxide production by eosinophils. sinophils were cultured with or without IFN overnight. IFN increased eosinophil TLR7 expression relative to unstimulated eosinophils. eosinophils were treated with or without IFN overnight. eosinophils were loaded with an intracellular nitric oxide\u2013detecting fluorescent probe and stimulated with synthetic TLR7 agonist R837. IFN pretreatment potentiated the R837-induced fluorescence. C57BL/6 mice were sensitized (intraperitoneal, Days 1 and 14) and challenged (intratracheal, Days 24, 26, and 28) with ovalbumin. parainfluenza virus RNA was quantified by real-time RT-PCR 4 days after infection. expressing eosinophil-deficient NJ.1726-PHIL mice (Eos IL-5) was similar to that in wild-type mice. eosinophils, not IL-5, were mediating the antiviral effect. eosinophil-deficient PHIL mice alone had parainfluenza RNA levels comparable to infected wild-type mice. NJ.1726-PHIL mice (Eos IL-5) and PHIL mice (Eos IL-5) had parainfluenza RNA levels comparable to WT. no eosinophils were detected in the bronchoalveolar lavage. eosinophil peroxidase is not required for eosinophils\u2019 antiviral effect in vivo. WT mice and eosinophil peroxidase knockout mice were sensitized and challenged (S/C) with ovalbumin and infected with parainfluenza virus. parainfluenza-infected eosinophils produce viral progeny that are not infectious. parainfluenza RNA from eosinophil supernatants was quantified by real-time RT-PCR every 24 hours. eosinophils were isolated from the peripheral blood and infected for 2 hours. eosinophils significantly decreased parainfluenza virus titers compared with virus-inoculated cultures without eosinophils. a further reduction in virus titers was seen when eosinophils were pretreated with IFN. however, the quantities of RNA for all three parainfluenza virus structural proteins were similar. za infectivity was not due to viral RNA degradation by eosinophil granule RNases. eosinophils significantly decreased parainfluenza virus titers compared with parainfluenza incubated in media without eosinophils. eosinophils treated with l-NAME lost their ability to reduce virus titers. human eosinophils isolated from peripheral blood were cultured overnight with IFN. IFN increased eosinophil TLR7 expression relative to unstimulated eosinophils, both quantitatively by real-time RT-PCR. eosinophils treated for 1 hour with the synthetic TLR7 agonist, R837, had significantly increased fluorescence compared with vehicle-treated controls. l-NAME and the oligonucleotide TLR7 antagonist blocked R837-induced nitric oxide production. inophils were loaded with an intracellular nitric oxide\u2013detecting fluorescent probe. eosinophil fluorescence increased in response to R837. eosinophils appear to mediate their antiviral effects via passive and proactive mechanisms. findings expand on prior eosinophil studies (12\u201314, 17, 18, 27) by establishing an antiviral role for eosinophils against parainfluenza virus. previous studies proposed that eosinophils inhibit RSV and pneumonia virus in mice, in part via the degradation of viral RNA genomes by eosinophils\u2019 granule RNases. the ability of eosinophils to produce nitric oxide has been suspected for some time. eosinophils generate nitric oxide in response to virus infection. eosinophils generate nitric oxide in response to stimulation with synthetic TLR7 agonist. nitric oxide may alter host cell function through nitrosylation of tyrosine and thiol groups. eosinophils\u2019 attenuation of parainfluenza virus infection was not dependent on the release of eosinophil peroxidase. eosinophil peroxidase has been shown to have virucidal effects against human immunodeficiency virus in vitro. transgenic mice (Eos IL-5) with an abundance of airway eosinophils had reduced parainfluenza virus in the lung, NJ.1726-PHIL mice (Eos IL-5) with elevated IL-5 in the absence of eosinophils did not. this is pertinent given the presence of IL-5 receptors on leukocytes other than eosinophils. eosinophils have beneficial antiviral effects during respiratory virus infections. despite considerable evidence linking viruses to asthma exacerbations, we cannot conclude that eosinophils\u2019 antiviral effects result in fewer exacerbations."}
