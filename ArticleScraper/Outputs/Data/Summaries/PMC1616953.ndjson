{"summary": "translational recoding has been identified in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. it includes stop codon readthrough, ribosome hopping and 1 programmed frameshifting. ribosomes are induced to shift to an alternative reading frame 1 nt 3\u2032-wards (+1 frameshifting) or 5\u2032-wards (1 frameshifting) of the mRNA. a single case of programmed +1 frameshifting is known in prokaryotes (10,11) while in eukaryotes, including humans, several genes regulated by this recoding event have been described previously. only two examples in prokaryotes (12\u201314) and few others in eukaryotes (15\u201317). lobus solfataricus is putatively expressed by programmed 1 frameshifting (24) this gene is organized in the open reading frames (ORFs) SSO11867 and SSO3060 of 81 and 426 amino acids. the region of overlap between the two ORFs had the characteristic features of the genes expressed by programmed 1 frameshifting. the rare codons are boxed and the arrows indicate the stems of the putative mRNA secondary structure. arrows indicate the stems of the putative mRNA secondary structure. the functionality of the product of the mutant gene fucA1A does not provide direct experimental evidence that programmed 1 frameshifting occurs in vivo and in S.solfataricus. nomenclature and characteristics of the -fucosidase genes Gene name Status Name of the recombinant protein Slippery heptamera fucA1 wild type 1 frameshifted. equal amounts of E.coli cultures expressing the wild-type and mutant genes, normalized for the OD600, were resuspended in SDS\u2013PAGE loading buffer. oPure anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) from Pierce Biotechnology (Rockford, IL, USA) western blot analyses were developed by following manufacturer's indications. the molecular weight markers used were the ECL streptavidin\u2013HRP conjugate. expression and characterization of mutant Ss-fucB were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis from the vector pGEX-11867/3060. the synthetic oligonucleotides used were FucA1sm-rev and fucA1tm. the mutant gene, named fucA1sm, was completely re-sequenced. the supernatant containing peptides was analysed by MALDIMS on an Applied Biosystem Voyager DE-PRO mass spectrometer using -cyano-4-hydroxycynnamic acid as matrix. mass calibration was performed by using the standard mixture provided by manufacturer. peptide ions were selected in the collision cell and fragmented. fucA1 gene was completely re-sequenced to check if undesired mutations were introduced by PCR. plasmids expressing mutant genes fucA1A, fucA1sm and fucA1tm were prepared by substituting the KpnI\u2013NcoI wild-type fragment containing the slippery site. ricus tRNA, 2 l of [35S]methionine (1200 Ci/mmol at 10 mCi/ml) and 10 pmol of each mRNA were incubated at 70\u00b0C for 45 min. after this time, the synthesized proteins were resolved by electrophoresis 12.5% acrylamide\u2013SDS gels. for each amplification of the fucA1 gene was used 2500-fold more cDNA than that used for the amplification of the 16S rRNA gene. PCR conditions were 15 min at 95\u00b0C for initial denaturation, followed by 40 cycles of 10 s at 95\u00b0C, 25 s at 56\u00b0C and 35 s at 72\u00b0C. fucA1B, fucA1sm and fucA1tm as fusions of glutathione S-transferase (GST) and purification of the recombinant proteins were performed. the nomenclature used in this paper for the different -fucosidase genes is listed in Table 1. bond-P polyvinylidenfluorid filters were diluted 1:5000 and 1:40 000. the filters were washed and incubated with the anti-Ss-fuc antibody. the antibody was conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. synthetic oligonucleotides used were FucA1tm-rev, 5\u2032-AGGTGATATTGGTGTTCTGGTCTATCTGGC-3\u2032. plasmid containing desired mutations and mutant genes fucA1sm and fucA1tm were completely re-sequenced. enzymatic characterization of Ss-fucB was performed as described previously. the gel pieces were washed several times with the buffer, resuspended in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate and incubated with 100 ng of trypsin for 2 h at 4\u00b0C and overnight at 37\u00b0C. the supernatant containing peptides was analysed by MALDIMS on an Applied Biosystem Voyager DE-PRO mass spectrometer using -cyano-4-hydroxycynnamic acid as matrix mRNAs encoding wild-type fucA1 and its various mutants were obtained by in vitro run-off transcription. about 2 g of each plasmid was linearized with BssHII and incubated with 50 U of T7 RNA polymerase for 1 h 30 min at 37\u00b0C. the transcription mixtures were then treated with 10 U of DNAseI (RNAse free) for 30 min. the samples (25 l final volume) contained 5 l of S.solfataricus cell extract, 10 mM KCl, 20 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 7.0, 20 mM acetate, 3 mM ATP, 1 mM GTP, 5 g of bulk S.solfataricus tRNA, 2 l of [35S]methionine (1200 Ci/mmol at 10 mCi/ml) and cDNA was amplified in a Bio-Rad LightCycler using the DyNAmo HS Syber Green qPCR Kit (Finnzymes Oy, Espoo, Finland) for each amplification of the fucA1 gene was used 2500-fold more cDNA than that used for the amplification of the 16S rRNA gene. PCR conditions were 15 min at 95\u00b0C for initial denaturation, followed by 40 cycles of 10 s at each cDNA was used in triplicate for each amplification. the wild-type fucA1 gene produced trace amounts of -fucosidase activity (2.3 102 units mg1 after removal of GST), suggesting that a programmed 1 frameshifting may occur in E.coli (24). 7% SDS\u2013PAGE showing (line 1) the recombinant Ss-fuc and (line 2) the purified products of the wild-type split fucA1 gene. the protein concentration of the latter sample could not be quantified because of the scarcity of the purification yields. polypeptide A results from a shift in a site A and it is identical to Ss-fuc prepared by site-directed mutagenesis (24), suggesting that the expression occurred with the simultaneous P- and A-site slippage. instead, polypeptide B, named Ss-fucB, is generated by frameshifting in a second site B as the result of a single P-site slippage. the slippery sequence in fucA1 A-AAA-AAT was mutated in A-AAG-AAG-T. the new mutant gene was named fucA1B. the first G, producing the conservative mutation AAAAAG, was made to disrupt the slippery sequence and thus reducing the shifting efficiency. the second G was inserted to produce the frameshifting that results in the amino acid sequence of Peptide B. rhamnoside, 4-nitrophenyl--d-glucoside, -xyloside, -galactoside and -mannoside were not substrates of Ss-fucB as shown previously for Ss-fuc (24). this suggests that the different amino acid sequence did not significantly affect the active site. both enzymes showed an identical profile of specific activity versus temperature with an optimal temperature higher than 95\u00b0C. the mutations disrupt the slippery sequence, but maintain the 1 frameshift between the two ORFs (Table 1). Interestingly, the expression of fucA1sm in E.coli produced a full-length polypeptide that showed the same electrophoretic migration of Ss-fuc and Ss-fucB. the blot was probed with anti-GST antibodies. it produced the mutation AAAGAA (LysGlu) in the 1 frame of the ORF SSO3060. the mutation cancelled the frameshifting site A and enhanced frameshifting efficiency of site B. no full-length protein could be detected in western blots probed with either anti-GST or anti-Ss-fuc antibodies. western blot analysis of recombinant Ss-fuc (lanes 1, 2, 5 and 6, 0.14 g) and of extracts of S.solfataricus cells grown on YSM (lanes 3, 4, 7 and 8, 153 g) samples in lanes 1, 3, 5 and 7 were not denaturated before loading. samples in lanes 1, 3, 5 and 7 were not denaturated before loading. western blot analysis of recombinant Ss-fuc (lane 1, 0.1 g) incubated at 100\u00b0C for 5 min, 1 h and 2 h. molecular weight markers were: phosphorylase b (97 000), albumin (66 000), ovalbumin (45 000), carbonic anhydrase (31 000) and trypsin inhibitor (20 100) the inset shows the corresponding products found in the real-time PCR visualized by ethidium bromide staining. rRNA16S was amplified after 17 cycles while the amplification of fucA1 mRNA was observed after 38 cycles. this indicates that the gene fucA1 is transcribed at very low level. a promoter of T7 polymerase was inserted ahead of the gene of interest to obtain RNA transcripts endowed with the short 5\u2032-untranslated region of 9 nt observed for the natural fucA1 mRNA (24). the wild-type fucA1 transcript produced a tiny but clear band whose molecular weight correspond to that of the full-length Ss-fuc obtained by site-directed mutagenesis (24) sized proteins were revealed by autoradiography. lane 1, no mRNA added; lane 2, fucA1sm; lane 3, wild-type fucA1; lane 4, fucA1A; lane 5, fucA1tm. heptanucleotide is essential for the expression of the fucA1 gene in S.solfataricus. overlapping region of the two ORFs confirmed by liquid chromatography online tandem mass spectrometry (LCMSMS) analysis of the peptide mixtures. results demonstrate that the protein containing the Peptide A is produced in E.coli by a frameshifting event that occurred exactly within the slippery heptamer predicted from the analysis. markers were -galactosidase (175 000), paramyosin (83 000), glutamic dehydrogenase (62 000), aldolase (47 500) and triosephosphate isomerase (32 500). a second Peptide B is absent in the spectra of the Ss-fuc control protein. 1.2 kDa, which is not expressed by the mutant gene fucA1A, was fused to the polypeptide encoded by the ORF SSO11867 solely. this polypeptide originated from the translational termination of the ribosome at the OCH codon of the fucA1 N-terminal ORF. the calculated ratio of frameshifting to the termination products was 5%. gel filtration chromatography showed that in native conditions Ss-fucB had the same nonameric structure of Ss-fuc with an identical molecular weight of 508 kDa. the two enzymes have high affinity for 4-nitrophenyl--l-fucoside (4NP-Fuc) substrate at 65\u00b0C. the KM is identical within the experimental error (0.0287 0.005 mM) while the kcat of Ss-f pHs above 6.0, which is close to the intracellular pH of S.solfataricus (30).. a single peptide encompassing the overlapping region between the ORFs with a. the sequence of peptide C was Glu-Phe-Gly-Pro-Val-Thr-Asp-Phe-Gly-Tyr-Lys. it is identical to that of peptide B produced from fucA1. the presence of a Glu instead of Lys was not unexpected. western blot of partially purified protein samples expressed in E.coli fused to GST from wild-type and mutant fucA1 genes. extracts of E.coli cells expressing parental plasmid pGEX-2TK were used as the negative control (pGEX) the blot was probed with anti-GST antibodies. the extracts of S.solfataricus cells grown on YSM revealed by western blot a band of a molecular mass >97 kDa. the different molecular mass may result from post-translational modifications occurred in the archaeon or from the incomplete denaturation of a protein complex. to test which hypotheses were appropriate, cellular extracts of S.solfataricus were analysed by western blot extending the incubation at western blot analysis of recombinant Ss-fuc (lanes 1, 2, 5 and 6, 0.14 g) and of extracts of S.solfataricus cells grown on YSM (lanes 3, 4, 7 and 8, 153 g) samples in lanes 1, 3, 5 and 7 were not denaturated before loading. a band corresponding to the region of overlap between the ORFs SSO11867 and SSO3060 was observed in the RNA extracted from cells grown on YSM and YGM media. rRNA16S was amplified after 17 cycles while the amplification of fucA1 mRNA was observed after 38 cycles. this indicates the gene fucA1 is transcribed at very low level. significant differences in the fucA1 mRNA level were observed in cells grown in YSM or YGM media. this is further confirmed by the analysis by western blot of the extracts of the same cells of S.solfataricus used to prepare the total RNAs. mRNAs obtained by in vitro transcription of the cloned wild-type fucA1 gene and the mutants thereof were used to program an in vitro translation system prepared as described by Cond ribosomes of S.solfataricus can decode split fucA1 gene by programmed 1 frameshifting. ribosomes of S.solfataricus can decode the split fucA1 gene by programmed 1 frameshifting. a split gene encoding a putative -fucosidase could be expressed through programmed 1 frameshifting (24) it is a common strategy to study recoding events from different organisms in E.coli. the expression in E.coli of the wild-type split gene fucA1 led to the production by frameshifting. a full-length polypeptide expresses the same molecular mass of the recombinant protein. this demonstrates that the translational machinery of S.solfataricus is fully competent to perform programmed frameshifting. it seems likely that the observed discrepancy in molecular mass might arise from post-translational modifications that cannot be produced by the translation in vitro. single mutant fucA1sm showed an even increased frequency of frameshifting (10%) if compared to the wild-type and produced only one polypeptide by shifting specifically in site B. the single mutation in the slippery sequence of fucA1sm inactivated the simultaneous P- and A-site tRNA re-positioning and, in the same time, encouraged the shifting efficiency of the tRNA in the P-site. programmed frameshifting is used to set the ratio of two polypeptides of the -fucosidase from S.solfataricus. this is the only fucosidase gene expressed by programmed 1 frameshifting. a gene encoding for a (1,2)-fucosyltransferase from Helicobacter pylori is interrupted by a 1 frameshifting (38) the expression by programmed frameshifting would lead to a functional enzyme synthesizing components of the surface lipopolysaccharides to evade the human immune defensive system. experiments are currently in progress to knockout the wild-type fucA1 gene. 34 interrupted genes present in the genome of S.solfataricus. 11 of these genes are composed by two ORFs separated by 1 frameshifting. this finding is the missing piece in the puzzle of the phylogenetic distribution of programmed frameshifting."}
