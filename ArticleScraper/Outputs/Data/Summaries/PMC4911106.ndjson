{"summary": "early stages of the disease are characterized by transient inflammation and compensatory remyelination. endogenous myelin repair is not sustainable and ultimately gives way to a stage of chronic neurodegeneration and progressive accumulation of disability. current FDA-approved disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) target the immune component of MS and have demonstrated effectiveness in reducing relapse rates. intraspinal injection of NPCs derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) using a direct differentiation method (DD-NPCs) promotes neurologic recovery in mice afflicted with virus-induced immune-mediated demyelination. recovery was facilitated by the emergence of immunosuppressive CD4+/CD25+/FOXP3+ regulatory T cells. hNPCs derived by different methods correlate with clinical effectiveness of the cells in a model of MS. despite these differences, hNPCs derived using these distinct methods promote the generation of anti-inflammatory Tregs. hiPSCs formed embryoid body-like structures (EBs) on fifth day of culture in hESC medium. 20\u201350 EBs were transferred to each well of a Geltrex-coated 6-well dish. resulting columnar rosette structures were collected using Accutase. EB-NPCs were seeded on Geltrex-coated slides, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, stained with rat anti-Nestin (1:500; Millipore), rabbit anti-Sox2 (1:50; Epitomics), or rabbit anti-Pax 6 (1:50; BioLegend) slides were cover-slipped and mounted using a DAPI inverted microscope. RNA was quantified using the mirVana miRNA Isolation Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) the RNA quality of each sample was determined using the 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) to obtain an RNA integrity Number (RNA integrity Number) samples with acceptable RINs (9.0\u201310.0) were amplified, labeled and hybridized onto Illumina HumanHT-12 v4 Expression Beadchips according to manufacturer's instructions. clinical evaluation was based on the following scoring system: 0, asymptomatic; 0.5, ruffled fur; 1, limp tail; 2, waddling gait without righting difficulty; 3, hind-limb weakness and extreme righting difficulty; 3.5, complete hind limb paralysis; and 4, death. animals previously inoculated with JHMV were injected with 250,000 EB-NPCs or human fetal fibroblasts resuspended in 2.5 l HBSS Flow Cytometric Analysis of Spinal Cords Animals were euthanized via inhalation of a lethal dose of isofluorane and cardiac perfusion with PBS. single-cell suspensions were filtered, washed, and counted before being blocked with anti-mouse CD16/32 (1:200; BD Biosciences), anti-CD4 (FITC-conjugated GK1.5; BD Biosciences), anti-CD45 (AP spinal cords were dissected and fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde. the total area of the white matter was quantified and compared to the area of demyelinated regions using ImageJ software. mice were injected intraperitoneally with 150 g of a rat monoclonal antibody specific for CD25 (rat anti-mouse CD25, clone PC61.5 [20, 21]) or control rat immunoglobulin G (Sigma) as previously described. TGF-2 production by EB-NPCs and DD-NPCs was determined using human Quantikine ELISA Kits. unless otherwise noted, comparisons were performed using one-way analysis of variance. hiPSCs formed embryoid body-like structures (EBs) on fifth day of culture in hESC medium. 20\u201350 EBs were transferred to each well of a Geltrex-coated 6-well dish. resulting columnar rosette structures were collected using Accutase. EB-NPCs were cultured in neuronal differentiation medium (Neurobasal, 1X B27, 1X GlutaMAX), or astrocyte differentiation medium (DMEM [Thermo Fisher], 1X N2, 1X GlutaMAX, 1% FBS [Atlanta Biologicals]) for at least 14 days before being fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with mouse anti-beta-III-tubulin (1:500; Mill the RNA quality of each sample was determined using the 2100 Bioanalyzer. samples with acceptable RINs (9.0\u201310.0) were amplified, labeled and hybridized onto Illumina HumanHT-12 v4 Expression Beadchips according to manufacturer's instructions. asymptomatic; 0.5, ruffled fur; 1, limp tail; 2, waddling gait without righting difficulty; 3, hind-limb weakness and extreme righting difficulty; 3.5, complete hind limb paralysis; and 4, death. animals previously inoculated with JHMV were injected with 250,000 EB-NPCs or human fetal fibroblasts in 2.5 l HBSS. single-cell suspensions were filtered, washed, and counted before being blocked with anti-mouse CD16/32 (1:200; BD Biosciences), anti-CD4 (FITC-conjugated GK1.5; BD Biosciences), anti-CD8 (PE-Cy7-conugated Ly-2; BD Biosciences), anti-CD45 (APC-conjugated 30-F11; eBioscience), anti-F4/80 ( the total area of the white matter was quantified and compared to the area of demyelinated regions using ImageJ software (NIH) the total area of the white matter was quantified and compared to the area of demyelinated regions using imageJ software. rat monoclonal antibody specific for CD25 (rat anti-mouse CD25, clone PC61.5 [20, 21]) or control rat immunoglobulin G (Sigma) was determined by collection of peripheral blood from the peri-orbital sinus of anesthetized animals. EB-NPC co-culture and Treg induction Spleens were dissected from nave age-matched C57BL/6 mice. ELISA Kits from R&D Systems were analyzed using Prism software (GraphPad) unless otherwise noted, comparisons were performed using one-way analysis of variance, followed by post hoc analysis using Tukey\u2019s procedure where appropriate. sorted EB-NPCs were subjected to directed differentiation conditions for 14 days. markers indicative of neurons (Tuj1), astrocytes (GFAP) and oligodendrocyte lineages (NG2 and Olig2) were detected, confirming multipotency (S1D\u2013S1G Fig). in vivo bioluminescence imaging revealed transplanted EB-NPCs were present in the spinal cords of mice at day 1 post-transplant (p.t.) however, a marked reduction in luciferase activity was detected at day 4 p.t., and by day 8 p.t., EB-NPCs were undetectable by IVIS imaging. JHMV-infected animals that received an intraspinal transplant of EB-NPCs at day 14 p.i. did not exhibit clinical benefits as compared to animals transplanted with human dermal fibroblasts. Flow cytometric analysis of the 12 mm spinal cord region spanning the injection site revealed a significant (p0.01) reduction in CD4+ T cell frequency within the CNS of EB-NPC transplanted animals compared to controls. the frequency of CD4 and CD8 T cells was significantly reduced in EB-NPC-transplanted animals compared to animals injected with human fibroblasts or HBSS. data represents two independent experiments with n = 6 (EB-NPC), n = 4 (fibroblast) and n = 5 (HBSS) animals per group. brightfield images of coronal spinal cord sections stained with luxol fast blue (LFB) and counter-stained with hemotoxylin and eosin (H&E) showed significantly reduced demyelination at the injection site in the spinal cords of EB-NPC-injected mice. Tregs induced in the CNS following transplantation of DD-NPCs [14] were critical for clinical and histologic improvement in mice persistently infected with JHMV. we evaluated the levels of CD4+/FOXP3+ Tregs in the draining cervical lymph nodes (CLNs) and CNS of animals transplanted with EB-NPCs at days 5, 7 and 21 p.t. n = 4 (EB-NPC), n = 6 (Fibroblast) and n = 4 (HBSS) animals per group. data is presented as average SEM and was analyzed using one-way ANOVA. EB-NPCs were co-cultured with T cells enriched from splenoctyes. T cells were mixed with EB-NPCs at varying T cell-to-EB-NPC ratios. the frequency and number of FOXP3-expressing CD4+ T cells increased. treatment with anti-CD25 depletes CD4+FoxP3+ Tregs. n = 8 (EB-NPC alone), n = 9 (EB-NPC + IgG control), n = 9 (EB-NPC + PC61.5), and n = 8 (HBSS) animals per group. EB-NPCs are distinct cell type compared to previously published DD-NPCs. DD-NPCs from iPSCs and ESCs cameled as one group, while undifferentiated PSCs and EB-NPCs had distinct gene expression profiles. this result was also observed a hierarchically-sorted heat map was examined. EB-NPCs are significantly different than our previously differentiated NPCs. luciferase-expressing iPSCs were differentiated to NPCs. this method results in heterogeneous cultures of neural stem and precursor cells. differentiated cells were enriched for NPCs via flow cytometric sorting. iPSCs were transduced with a lentiviral vector containing the Photinus pyralis luciferase gene and puromycin resistance cassette. photon emission in response to D-luciferin could be detected in transduced puromycin-selected iPSCs but not in non-transduced iPSCs in vitro. specific cytoplasmic marker confirmed the loss of EB-NPCs in the spinal cords of transplanted mice. iPSC-derived NPCs are rapidly rejected following intraspinal transplantation in JHMV-infected mice. timeline highlighting the relationship of T cell infiltration and demyelination in response to JHMV infection of the CNS. Flow cytometric analysis of the 12 mm spinal cord region spanning the injection site revealed a significant (p0.01) reduction in CD4+ T cell frequency within the CNS of EB-NPC transplanted animals compared to controls. however, no differences in the frequencies of CD8+ T cells, virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, macrophages, (CD45hiF4/80+) or microglia (CD45lowF4/80+) were quantification confirmed a significant difference in demyelination at the transplant site of EB-NPC-transplanted animals (28.6% 5.4%, n = 11) compared to HBSS-injected controls (58.4% 7.3%, n = 7). but the observed reduction in demyelination was not sustained along the rostro-caudal axis relative to the injection site. axon diameter vs. total fiber diameter confirmed enhanced remyelination at the transplant site of EB-NPC-injected mice compared to controls. for (B) and (C), data represents two independent experiments with n = 11 (EB-NPC), n = 8 (Fibroblast) and n = 7 (HBSS) animals per group. d animals compared to fibroblast and HBSS injected controls at day 5 p.t. increased Treg accumulation in the CLNs and spinal cord was not detected in EB-NPC, fibroblast, or HBSS injected animals at day 7 and 21 p.t. T cells were co-cultured with splenoctyes of non-infected mice. increased frequency and number of CD4+FOXP3+ Tregs was observed. treatment with the monoclonal antibody PC61.5 (anti-murine CD25 rat IgG1) depletes CD4+FoxP3+ Tregs and is widely used to characterize Treg function in vivo. mice were injected with PC61.5 at days -2, 0, and 2 p.t. treatment with anti-CD25 resulted in increased demyelination compared to non-treated EB-NPC-transplanted animals. n = 8 (EB-NPC alone), n = 9 (EB-NPC + IgG control), n = 9 (EB-NPC + PC61.5), and n = 8 (HBSS) animals per group. EB-NPCs shared many characteristics with previously published DD-NPCs. but they were unable to promote significant clinical recovery in transplanted mice. DD-NPCs derived from both iPSCs and hESCs expressed high levels of TGF-2, while EB-NPCs and undifferentiated PSCs did not. EB-NPCs cluster away from pluripotent stem cells and NPCs derived from both ESCs and iPSCs. the use of fetal-derived NPCs for transplantation may be restricted by the consistency and quality of donor tissue. the use of fetal-derived NPCs for transplantation may be restricted by the consistency and quality of donor tissue. EB-NPCs were rapidly rejected following injection into the spinal cords of immunocompetent mice. no cellular migration to peripheral immune organs was observed in the CNS of EB-NPC-transplanted mice. xeno-antigens alone are not sufficient to promote the focal remyelination induced by EB-NPCs. xeno-antigens alone are not sufficient to promote the focal remyelination induced by EB-NPCs. models of demyelination is leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) LIF promotes Treg induction mainly by suppressing differentiation of conventional CD4+ T cells to a pro-inflammatory phenotype. besides TGF-, human LIF could not be detected in EB-NPC supernatants. thus, it is likely that the methods used to generate and isolate EB-NPCs may have yielded a population of cells that lack the appropriate characteristics to confer differentiated EB-NPCs expressed markers restricted to neurons (Tuj1+) astrocytes (GFAP)+ astrocytes, and the oligodendrocyte lineage (NG2 & Olig2).
