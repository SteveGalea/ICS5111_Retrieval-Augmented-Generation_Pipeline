{"summary": "the use of bacteriophage as an alternative to antibiotic therapy for bacterial disease is reappraised in the western world. the use of phage technologies in the field of treatment of various bacterial infections has shown significant success in studies in Eastern Europe. a large number of M. tuberculosis bacteriophages have been observed and complete genomes are now available. in 1991, Zemskova and Dorozhkova reported that DS-6A could have a beneficial effect in guinea pigs with disseminated tuberculosis. but its action was observed to be less than that of isoniazid monotherapy (70). in 2002 Broxmeyer et al. proved that the lytic phage TM4 can kill intracellular pathogens (M. avium and M. tuberculosis) clinical trials are being considered for an aerosol variant for use in patients with cystic fibrosis. there is no evidence that aerosol delivery of phage would result in more phage reaching the lung than other routes such as injection and intranasal administration. phages tend to be rapidly inactivated by the reticuloendothelial system. both 7H9 and 7H10 broth contained 10% (vol/vol) oleic acid-albumin-dextrose-catalase (OADC); the plates showed confluent lysis. the top agar in these plates was scraped into a tube, followed by the addition of 10 ml of suspension medium (SM containing 100 mM NaCl, 8.5 mM MgSO47H2O, 50 mM Tris-Cl [pH nebulizer is the gold standard for laboratory bioaerosol generation (49) the concentration of phage D29 suspension in the nebulizer was 108 PFU/ml. the nebulizer is an all-glass instrument with a 50% cut size of 0.3 m (44) the spray medium that resulted in highest fraction of culturable D29 was selected in the following experiments. this generation method was used to test for the most efficient collection fluid, sampler, and the influence of relative humidities on phage D29 culturability. the genome extraction and real-time PCR assay were both operated using the same protocol as that used to generate a standard curve. the sequences were as follows: forward primer, 5\u2032-AGC TAC GCG GGT TCG ATTC-3\u2032; reverse primer, 5\u2032-CCG GTC CTC GGG CTA AAA-3\u2032; and probe, 5\u2032-FAM-CCG TCG CCC GCT CCA-3\u2032-NFQ-MGB. the survivability of the aerosol was evaluated in different RHs. the effect of RH on the variation in phage culturability was determined by calculating the logarithm of recovery rates. each collected sample was serially diluted 10-fold. each solution was plated on duplicate plates and incubated at 37\u00b0C. effect of storage conditions on phage D29 culturability was evaluated. 104 phages were mixed with 300 l of bacterial stock and 3 to 5 ml of 7H9 top agar. the mixture was plated on a 90-mm petri dish containing Middlebrook 7H10 agar. both 7H9 and 7H10 broth contained 10% (vol/vol) oleic acid-albumin-dextrose-catalase (OADC; BBL Middlebrook OADC Enrichment; BD Inc.) the nebulizer is the gold standard for laboratory bioaerosol generation (49) the concentration of phage D29 suspension in the nebulizer was 108 PFU/ml. a port was used to supply the chamber with make-up air. the optimal spray liquid was first evaluated based on the fraction of culturable phage particles in the sampled aerosol to that in the suspension pre-aerosolization. the spray medium that resulted in highest fraction of culturable D29 was selected in the following experiments. the biosampler (SKC, Inc.) is an all-glass instrument, similar in concept and shape to the AGI-30 impinger, but with three angled nozzles. both the AGI-30 and the Biosampler were filled with 20 ml of SM buffer and ran simultaneously at the recommended operational flow rate of 12.5 liters min1. PCR cycling protocol was as follows: initial step to active polymerase at 95\u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 40 amplification cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s (denaturation) and 60\u00b0C for 1 min (annealing and extension) Genomic DNA extraction from pure culture of D29 with the TIANamp virus DNA kit was performed according to the manufacturer's guidelines. each collected sample was serially diluted 10-fold. each solution was plated on duplicate plates and incubated at 37\u00b0C. the effect of storage conditions on phage D29 culturability was evaluated. a one-way analysis of variance was used to compare the recovery rates of three spray media. the difference between AGI-30 and Biosampler was investigated using paired t tests. each column represents the mean value of at least three experiments. a significant difference was not detected between SM buffer and nutrient broth or between PBS and deionized water. the evaporate volumes of the four media were not significantly different in 5-min samplings. the total recovery rates of phage D29 after it decayed for 15 min in high-RH (85% 5%), medium-RH (55% 5%), and low-RH (25% 5%) conditions were 0.81 102, 0.41 102, and 2.12 102, respectively. after 30 min of decay in the test chamber the total recovery rates were 0.24 102, 0.09 102, and 1.82 102. the maintenance of their integrity and infectivity depends on the nature of nebulizers or spray liquids. in the present study, Collison nebulizer was used and three spray liquids were evaluated. the results showed that deionized water is better than PBS and normal saline. the properties of generated aerosols with three spray liquids were identical as a function of particle size distribution. the stresses cause injury to organisms and lead to the loss of viability. a good sample medium should be selected to limit the injury. the results proved that SM buffer and nutrient broth are excellent in collecting phage D29. AGI-30 and SKC Biosampler are both liquid impingers. they work by accelerating airborne particles through narrow orifices. this is consistent with the findings of Rule et al. (49) and Lin et al. (31) able, and cultivable were 10- to 100-fold greater than that using the plaque assay method. a direct comparison was obtained between the total number with the number of cultivable phage. SM buffer and nutrient broth as optimal collection media were used. culturability of phage D29 did not change in both media when stored at 4 or 25\u00b0C. up to 24 h, it still did not change in nutrient broth when stored at 4\u00b0C."}
