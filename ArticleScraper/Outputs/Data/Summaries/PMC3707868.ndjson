{"summary": "multiple antibody display formats have been proposed and implemented in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems. the majority of these efforts have focused on the use of antibody fragments as surrogates for mAb lead identification and maturation rather than full-length immunoglobulin G proteins. these approaches necessitate conversion and reformatting in order to express the identified leads in the preferred production hosts. technologies for full-length mAbs in yeast were developed to enable display and secretion in the same cell. this method preserves co-secretion of full-length unmodified bivalent mAbs into culture medium while utilizing the natural antibody biogenesis pathway. this allows simultaneous selection of an antibody sequence with desired binding properties and its subsequent production in the same host. Strains, reagents, plasmids and Pichia transformation DNA recombination and cloning were performed with restriction endonucleases and DNA modification enzymes. PCR reactions were performed with pfuTurbo from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) NAc transferase I, Rattus norvegicus -1,2-GlcNAc transferase II, Drosophila melanogaster MnsII, Saccharomyces cerevisiae Gal epimerase, H. sapiens -1,4-galactosyl transferase Empty parent and control YGLY13979 YGLY8316 TRP2::AOX1p-anti-PCSK92- plasmid was ligated in frame to EcoRI-SalI pGLY3033 backbone. enables delivery of the FC-ScSED1 cassette under the control of the Pichia pastoris AOX1 promoter sequence. it contains the Pichia pastoris URA6 gene sequence, which serves as an integration locus in the genome. cell labeling After induction on methanol, 2 OD600 of cells( 107 cells) were collected into a 1.5-ml microfuge tube and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) then suspended in 100 l of PBS containing 1 l of goat anti-human Fc DyeLight 488 or anti-human Kappa light chain APC 635. Purification of mAbs mAbs were purified using a one-step, 96-well format STREAMLINE rProtein A methods described in [26]. Glycan characterization PNGase F, 2-aminobenzamide (2-AB) labeling and high performance liquid chromatography analysis of glycans has been described previously [22]. a codon optimized sequence of human IgG1 Fc fragment was synthesized using an EcoRI forward PCR primer containing the nucleic acid sequence of S. cerevisiae -mating factor signal sequence fused upstream of the sequence encoding the IgG1 Fc N-terminus. a SalI reverse primer encoding the C-terminus terminated in a sequence encoding a GGGG linker. a plasmid containing the human IgG1 gene sequence was used as a PCR template for amplification of an EcoRI--mating factor signal sequence-Fc-GGGG-SalI fragment. the plasmid enables delivery of the FC-ScSED1 cassette under the control of the Pichia pastoris AOX1 promoter sequence. each flowcell was regenerated between each analyte injection with 3 M MgCl for 40 s at 10 l/min. cell labeling After induction on methanol, 2 OD600 of cells( 107 cells) were collected into a 1.5-ml microfuge tube and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. mAbs were purified using a one-step, 96-well format STREAMLINE rProtein A methods described in [26] Purification of mAbs mAbs mAbs were purified using a one-step, 96-well format STREAMLINE rProtein A methods described in [26]. cSed1p-Fc(Hc+Lc) coupled to the association between the heavy chain and the light chain (Lc) within the antigen binding fragment (Fab) results in the secretion of fully assembled antibody molecules. soluble full length IgG occurs with equal probability resulting in secretion of the bivalent (H2+L2) in the culture medium. cells were labeled with anti-human IgG Kappa chain. fluorescence intensity was analyzed using flow cytometry. eluents were resolved by electrophoresis to establish presence of full-length IgGs. non-display parent strains without \"Fc bait\" can display monovalent antibodies. the secreted IgGs are modified with human-type N-glycans. same strains as in (I) were incubated with anti-Kappa antibodies. cell co-expressing anti-PCSK9 and Fc-Sed1p fusion were induced and incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature in 1XPBS buffer (solid); 1XPBS buffer containing 6 M Urea (dotted); 1XPBS buffer containing 0.5 M DTT (dashed); or 1XPBS containing 0.5 M DTT (dashed); or 1XPBS containing 0.5 M DTT (dashed); or 1XPBS anti-PCSK9 (Hc+Lc) antibody was used as a negative control. we incubated both display strains with fluorescently labeled anti-human Fc and biotinylated human PCSK9. cells displaying anti-PCSK9 reacted with both biotinylated PCSK9 antigen and anti-human Fc antibody. both heavy chain and light chain libraries were introduced separately into haploid Pichia pastoris strains containing the Fc-ScSed1p expression cassette. to create a full-length antibody library, haploid libraries of the heavy and light chains were combined by mating to generate a diploid full-length IgG library. this confirmed both the presence of heavy and light chains, and the amino acid sequence diversity in the library. d in 96-well plates to produce full-length secreted IgG for in vitro PCSK9 binding studies. diploids were cultured to express full length IgG library. cultured using 20nM biotinylated human PCSK9 and APC 635 labeled antihuman Kappa. single-point (2.5 nM rhPCSK9) SPR was used to isolate a novel mAb against PSCK9 with affinity similar to the original anti-PCSK9 lead. the anti-Kappa ELISA protein titers for novel leads reached up to 30 g/mL compared with 10 g/mL for the mAb1 control. the affinity values for lead S2-15 appeared lower in the 96-well experiment (Table 2). this is primarily due to the nature of the biacore data obtained by assaying crude supernatants from 96-well plates using the antigen. this assay can only be used for highthroughput clone selection. the combination of display and secretion in the same clone enables the continuity and fidelity of the antibody discovery process. this technology takes advantage of the antibody dimerization in the ER to achieve capture of the Fc region of a half mAb to an anchored Fc molecule. previous methods have utilized Fab anchoring through pairing of protein partners in the ER. eukaryotic antibody production cell line could be used to display monovalent (Hc+Lc) while simultaneously secreting full-length IgGs. a fungal system enables co-evolving the cell line and molecule of interest in the same experiment to generate \u201cgenetically-customized\u201d production hosts for each discovered lead. the development of a dual antibody surface display concept simplifies the process of therapeutic antibody discovery and development. it also has the potential to shorten development timelines and increase the probability of success."}
