Novimmune generated dual targeting bispecific antibodies (biAbs) allowing selective blockade of CD47 on malignant cells expressing CD19 or mesothelin. the anti-CD47/CD19 biAb NI-1701 enhances the phagocytic activity of tumor macrophages and limits suppressor cell infiltration in vitro. a major challenge for biologics that specifically target neurodegenerative diseases is the requirement to cross the blood brain barrier to engage the target. the next two talks will cover different approaches for potential treatment of other types of degenerative diseases such as Huntington's disease and ischemic heart disease. antibodies inhibiting CTLA4 and PD1-PD-L1 have shown remarkable clinical benefit. many clinical trials testing novel checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., anti-LAG3, anti-TIM3), alone, in combination, or with other targeted therapies. a novel recombinant protein disrupts the PD1 pathway while simultaneously activating tumor-reactive T cells. the protein disrupts the PD1 pathway while simultaneously activating tumor-reactive T cells. details of this CD80-Fc fusion protein will be presented. the two dominant display platforms (yeast and phage) were described almost twenty and thirty years ago, respectively. both approaches now being used by numerous investigators to generate antibodies of clinical and research utility. bury will discuss the inherent problems of accessing the diversity present in display libraries. UCB Celltech will describe approaches to isolate the memory B, plasma, cell repertoires, and novel fluorescence-based proximity secretion assay. all the approaches described above isolate antibodies on the basis of their binding properties. but it is well known that not all antibodies binding a target have similar activities. IONTAS will describe the creation of new antibody forms able to recognize inherently difficult targets. these are based on small biologically active cysteine-rich peptides identified in a variety of plants and toxins. this approach has been used to generate antibodies able to block ion channels. data will be presented with a CD30 specific CAR-T that effectively eliminates CD30+ lymphoma cells, but does not attack CD30 positive hematopoietic stems or progenitor cells. this ground-breaking approach could address some of the challenges of solid tumor targeting by CAR-T cells. in the final talk, David Gilham will introduce the topic of exploiting natural killer cell receptors for the development of CAR approaches. NK-CAR-T cells facilitate the interaction with multiple tumor antigens, potentially reducing the likelihood of antigen-negative tumor escape variants. pre-clinical models with this innovative and exiting new approach suggest that pre-conditioning is not required for therapeutic efficacy. al modifications (PTMs) involves the anchored in vivo site-specific modification of a specific target. the selection of functional antibodies against acetylated and conformational targets will be described. a multifunctional antibody (BI-1206) identified using this platform recognizes FcRI. a new microcapillary screening approach can be interrogated using a number of different methods. the platform isolates individual cells in minute capillaries. this approach can also be applied to proteins that are secreted and not physically linked to the cells producing them. the morning talks will address the latest developments with the chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) approach. the afternoon session will be centered on bispecific antibody approaches redirecting T cells to engage them in target cell killing. data will be presented on allo-antigen CAR-Tregs v. polyclonal Tregs in in vitro and in vivo efficacy of GVHD prevention.
