{"summary": "canine infectious respiratory diseases (CIRD) and viral enteritis pose notable threats to dog health. CIRD are complex and include canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2), canine distemper virus (CDV), canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV), canine herpesvirus (CHV), canine reovirus, Bordetella bronchiseptica and other pathogenic agents. canine circovirus (CanineCV), a newly discovered mammalian circovirus, was first reported by Kapoor et al. in 2012 [20], was first reported by Kapoor et al. in 2012 [20]. canineCV has been detected in dogs with severe hemorrhagic diarrhea, and it is more common in puppies than in adults [21, 22] the samples were obtained from the live vaccine Nobivac DHPPi. the rabies virus was obtained from the inactivated vaccine Nobivac Rabies. the positive canineCV, CCoV, and H3N2 CIV strains used in this study were maintained in our laboratory. Virus Primer name Primer sequence (5\u2019 to 3\u2019) PCR products CAV-2 CAV-2-Fa CGCTGARCAYTACTACCTTGTCTCTATATTATG 1020 bp CAV-2-Rb GGTAGAGCWCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTACC aF. the RNA extracted from positive controls and clinical samples was reverse transcribed to cDNA using random primer (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) the cDNA and DNA were stored at -20\u00b0C until PCR amplification. the reaction for each virus was performed in a 20-l volume that contained 10 l of 2 Taq Master Mix. mPCRs were optimized separately for CRV and CEV. two mixtures containing standard plasmid were used as templates. reaction for detection of CRV was performed in 20-l volume. both reaction procedures were as follows: initial denaturation at 97\u00b0C for 5 min. 30 cycles of denaturation at 97\u00b0C for 30 s, varied Ta for 45 s and 72\u00b0C for 1 min. 10 l of mPCR product loans were evaluated by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis. similar procedures were used to detect cross-reaction of CRV and CEV primers with RNA/DNA extracted from MDCK cells. plasmid mixtures (pMD-CAV-2/pMD-CDV/pMD-CIV/pMD-CPIV for CRV and pMD-CanineCV/pMD-CCoV/pMD-CPV for CEV) were diluted from 1109 to 1101 copies/l. the calculation method of copy number of individual plasmid was the same as the previous one. each individual plasmid was diluted from 11010 to 1101 copies/l each swab sample was extracted with a volume of 200 l according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. the template was a mixture of 1 l DNA extracted from each sample and 1 l cDNA obtained by RT. the primers were synthesized by Tianyihuiyuan Gene Technology Co., Ltd. (Guangzhou, China) the primers were synthesized by Tianyihuiyuan Gene Technology Co., Ltd. RNA extracted from positive controls and twenty nasal swabs (NS) and 20 anal swabs (AS) were extracted using the RaPure Viral RNA/DNA Kit (Magen, Guangzhou, China) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol, the extracted TNA was divided into two parts. the cDNA and DNA were stored at -20\u00b0C until PCR amplification. agarose gel electrophoresis ligated plasmids into pMD-18T simple vector. mPCRs were optimized separately for CRV and CEV. reaction for detection of CRV was performed in 20-l volume. mPCR was performed for each mixture to optimize the reaction with gradient annealing temperatures (Ta) ranging from 55\u00b0C to 65\u00b0C. 10 l of mPCR product loans were evaluated by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis. the plasmid mixtures were diluted from 1109 to 1101 copies/l. each individual plasmid was diluted from 11010 to 1101 copies/l. dilutions were used to determine the minimum detection limits of the mPCR methods. all swabs were placed in 1 ml ice-cold DMEM containing 10,000 U/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4\u00b0C to remove impurities. each swab sample was extracted with a volume of 200 l according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Lanes 112, gradient annealing temperatures were 55.0\u00b0C, 55.5\u00b0C, 56.0\u00b0C, 57.0\u00b0C, 58.2\u00b0C, 59.4\u00b0C, 60.6\u00b0C, 61.8\u00b0C, 63.0\u00b0C, 64.5\u00b0C, and 65.0\u00b0C, respectively. specificity of mPCRs was evaluated using other pathogens (RABV, E. coli and Salmonella enterica) and MDCK cells as templates. Sensitivity of mPCR methods Each plasmid was used as a template to evaluate the sensitivity of the mPCRs. the minimum detection limits for pMD-CAV-2, pMD-CDV, pMD-Cv and pMD-CPIV were 1103 (Fig 3A), 1103 (Fig 3B), 1104 (Fig 3C) and 1103 (Fig 3D) viral DNA copies. pMD-CAV-2, pMD-CanineCV, pMD-CCoV and pMD-CPIV were diluted from 11010 to 1101 copies/l. mixed plasmids (pMD-CAV-2/pMD-CDV/pMD-CIV/pMD-CPIV) were used to determine the minimum detection limit of the mPCR method. the detection mPCRs for both CRV and CEV were performed as three independent mPCR assays by using three different PCR instruments at different times. mixed CRV and CEV plasmids were diluted as templates from 1105 to 1103 copies/l to amplify specific fragments. CRV and CEV were tested on 20 NS and 20 AS clinical samples. the statistics are shown in Table 2. Detection of CRV and CEV in clinical samples using mPCRs. 85% (17/20) of the samples were virus positive. CPV and CCoV coinfection represented 5% (1/20) of AS samples. only one sample showed triple infection (CAV-2, CPIV and CDV coinfection) Lanes 112, gradient annealing temperatures were 55.0\u00b0C, 55.5\u00b0C, 56.0\u00b0C, 57.0\u00b0C, 58.2\u00b0C, 59.4\u00b0C, 60.6\u00b0C, 61.8\u00b0C, 63.0\u00b0C, 64.0\u00b0C, 64.5\u00b0C, and 65.0\u00b0C, respectively. specificity of mPCRs was evaluated using other pathogens (RABV, E. coli and salmonella enterica) and MDCK cells Sensitivity of mPCR methods Each plasmid was used as a template to evaluate the sensitivity of the mPCRs. for CRV, the minimum detection limits for pMD-CAV-2, pMD-CDV, pMD-CCoV and pMD-CPIV were 1104 viral copies. mixed plasmids (pMD-CAV-2, pMD-CanineCV, pMD-CCoV and pMD-CPIV) diluted from 1109 to 1101 copies/l, were used to determine the minimum detection limit of the CRV mPCR method. the detection mPCRs for both CRV and CEV were performed as three independent mPCR assays by using three different PCR instruments at different times. mixed CRV and CEV plasmids were diluted as templates from 1105 to 1103 copies/l to amplify specific fragments. CRV and CEV were tested on 20 NS and 20 AS clinical samples. 80% (16/20) of the samples were virus positive. both CAV-2 and CIV were detected in 5% (1/20) of the samples. infections, CDV and CPIV coinfection were identified in 5% (1/20) of NS samples. only one sample showed triple infection (CAV-2, CPIV and CDV coinfection) two dogs with particularly severe respiratory symptoms were demonstrated to be infected with CAV-2, CDV, CIV and CPIV. mPCR methods were tested on 20 NS and 20 AS samples collected from dogs with symptoms of respiratory disease or enteric disease. the ratio of positive samples to total samples was 80% (16/20) for CRV detection and 85% (17/20) for CEV detection. CPV and CDV clearly remain two of the more serious and epidemic diseases in dogs in worldwide at present. mPCR methods provide an efficient, sensitive, specific and low-cost testing tool for the detection of CRV (CAV-2, CDV, CIV and CPIV) and CEV (CAV-2, CanineCV, CCoV and CPV) this method is superior to other mPCR detection methods."}
