{"summary": "the first is whether the primary focus of the study is on viral and/or host transcripts. the second is whether the goal is to document the diversity of RNAs present or quantify the relative abundance of specific transcripts. the final decision is whether to incorporate multiple infection or reactivation time points (i.e., to profile early or late stages of infection) this Gem highlights the major challenges that can arise when studying viral transcriptomes with the leading RNA-Seq technologies. the limitations are most evident for viruses with large gene-dense double-stranded DNA genomes such as herpesviruses, poxviruses, and adenoviruses. the majority of short-read RNA-Seq studies document host responses to different perturbations or compare different cell types and tissues. standard short-read RNA-Seq pipelines generate tens of millions of paired-end reads that are aligned to the host genome and/or transcriptome. transcripts per million (TPM) is used to specify the relative abundance of a given transcript in a population. gene annotations specify the limits of individual transcribed mRNAs, the coding sequence (CDS) within, and known splicing patterns. alternative transcript structures can easily go undetected. RNA-seq of polyadenylated RNAs (A) or total RNA after rRNA depletion (B) enables profiling at a high resolution but requires a well-curated reference genome for analysis. cDNA sequencing on the PacBio platform enables full-length sequencing from 5\u2032 cap to the 3\u2032 RNA cleavage site. high error rates require dedicated correction and analysis pipelines. a schematic transcriptome plot denotes how different methodologies may impact data interpretation. polyadenylated transcripts (blue bars) are consistently represented regardless of protocol choice. nonadenylated transcripts (gray bars) are underrepresented/absent when using protocols that incorporate poly(A) selection or a cDNA priming step using poly(T) adaptors. scRNA-Seq protocols vary in degrees of throughput and sensitivity. the approach requires the sorting of dissociated cells into individual wells on a plate or chip or into individual oil droplets. each primer sequence incorporates a cell-specific barcode so that all subsequent reads from that one cell can be analyzed together. the current iteration of long-read RNA-Seq enables the sequencing of polyadenylated mRNAs from the 3\u2032 poly(A) tail toward the 5\u2032 cap. the current iteration of long-read RNA-Seq enables the sequencing of polyadenylated mRNAs from the 3\u2032 poly(A) tail toward the 5\u2032 cap. the generation of long sequence reads obviates the need to computationally stitch together sequence fragment single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing of cDNA using the Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) platform represents the most popular approach but faces stiff competition from nanopore array sequencing (Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION platform) of either cDNA or, most excitingly, the RNA itself. both approaches suffer from high error rates (47), although both suffer from high error rates. a sequencing adapter is ligated to the poly(A) tail, enabling first-strand synthesis to produce a stable RNA:cDNA hybrid. a motor protein is then attached to the polyadenylated RNA strand, which is unwound from the cDNA. as each nucleotide is drawn through the pore, it disrupts the current, enabling the sequence to be read. RNA populations of interest will broaden sequencing capabilities beyond polyadenylated mRNAs, as evidenced by the recent direct genome sequencing of RNA viruses such as influenza A virus (50) long-read sequencing is less useful when viral RNA yields are low. the requirement for micrograms of total RNA as the input material will limit the infection models that are compatible with current long-read RNA-Seq methodologies. the existence of polycistronic arrays in herpesviruses limits scRNA-Seq gene expression analyses, because all transcripts generated across the polycistronic unit share the same 3\u2032 end. scRNA-Seq software packages will discard reads that map identically against the 3\u2032 ends of multiple transcripts. this can significantly impact the alignment of viral reads to a transcriptome. the ability to directly sequence full-length RNAs within individual infected cells seems like science fiction. the speed at which nanopore and single-cell transcriptome sequencing technologies are developing seems certain to make this a reality. the use of NGS approaches to follow sequence variation within viral populations is advancing at a breath-taking pace. long-read sequencing presents fresh challenges in terms of read alignment, experimental validation, and, ultimately, the determination of the biological significance of rarer transcript isoforms. the speed of developments within the long-read sequencing field will soon yield new approaches to working with smaller amounts of input RNA."}
