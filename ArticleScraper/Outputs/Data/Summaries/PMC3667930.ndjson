{"summary": "influenza is an acute respiratory illness that manifests itself in the form of a typical seasonal epidemic during winter. it is responsible for a high consumption of healthcare resources (direct costs), reduced productivity (indirect costs) and intangible costs such as suffering and impairment of quality of life. influenza is responsible for increased recourse to general medical care, increases in hospitalisations and excess mortality. the need for ever more immunogenic and efficacious influenza vaccines has prompted the development of adjuvanted vaccines. adjuvants are agents which enhance the immunogenicity of their antigens by activating and/or prolonging their stimulatory effect. infants, children and adolescents were the subjects most affected by influenza. only 9.4% fell into the over-64 y age-class. the predominant circulating influenza virus was A/California/07/09pdm (67%), followed by B virus (B/Brisbane/60/2008) (23.5%) and A/H3N2 (9.3%). charACTERISTICS CASES (187) N\u00b0 (%) CONTROLS (187) N\u00b0 (%) P VALUE Mean age SD. 78.6 8.3 77.7 8.0 Gender: male 104 (55.6%) 104 (55.6%) Smokers 34 (17.6%) 36* 19 (10.2%) 0.009 Drinkers 18 (9.6%) 38* 9 (4.8%) 0.022 Pneumococcal vaccination 17 (9.1%) 105** 45 (24.1%) 70** only 3 of the vaccinated cases had no high-risk medical conditions. 23 (26.4%) had 1 high-risk medical condition, 32 (36.8%) had 2 conditions, 14 (16.1%) had 3 conditions, 11 (12.6%) had 4 conditions, 3 (3.4%) had 5 conditions and 1 had 6 conditions. fourteen (16.1%) vaccinated cases were smokers and 11 (12.6%) were drinkers. 78 37 (47.4%) 41 (52.6%) 44 35 (79.5%) 9 (20.5%) Hypertension 120 63 (52.5%) 57 (47.5%) 118 99 (83.9%) 19 (16.1%) Respiratory disease 58 31 (53.4%) 27 (46.5%) 17 15 (88.2%) 2 (11.8%) Diabetes 46 24 (52.2%) 22 (47.8%) 32 27 (84.4%) 5 (15.6%) Renal disease 40 24 (60.0%) 16 (40.0%) 16 12 (75.0%) 4 (25.0 Crude Odds Ratio Adjusted Odds Ratio Value (95% CI) P Effectiveness (IVE) Influenza vaccination* 0.029 (0.007\u20130.117) 0.000 97.1 (88.3\u201399.3) 0.052 (0.012\u20130.229) 0.000 94.8 (77.1\u201398.8) Inflexal V\u00ae vaccine effectiveness was 98.0% (85.2\u201399.7%) and the adjusted value was 95.2% (62.8\u201399.4%) in the elderly, the adjuvanted influenza vaccines (Fluad\u00ae considered together with Inflexal V\u00ae) were associated with a significant reduction in the risk of hospitalization for influenza or pneumonia. our study is the first to provide information on the effectiveness of the vaccine in terms of reducing hospitalization for influenza or pneumonia among subjects > 64 y. a case-control study performed by Herrera in 2003\u201304 showed 90% vaccine efficacy against influenza hospitalization. however, it is probable that the vaccines used were inactivated non-adjuvanted vaccines. other studies have shown 30% to 63% vaccine efficacy/effectiveness with regard to hospitalization. authors have tried to limit the variability of the findings of different studies by using the meta-analysis methodology. in 1995 Gross et al. performed a meta-analysis of 20 studies and found a 50% rate of efficacy in preventing hospitalization for pneumonia and influenza. CIRI-IT - Respiratory viruses (influenza viruses included) isolated during 2010\u201311 influenza season in Genoa. we selected our cases in the two largest hospitals in Genoa. the GPs of these subjects were then identified. the 2010\u201311 vaccination might have had a potent booster action. both the adjuvanted vaccines considered in our study showed very good levels of effectiveness. however, the results showed statistical significance only for Inflexal V\u00ae. the synergism between influenza infection and a greater susceptibility to Streptococcus pneumoniae is well established. our results also show that vaccination against S. pneumoniae was significantly more frequent among controls than cases. cases were recruited among hospitalized subjects by choosing patients with discharge diagnoses of influenza or pneumonia. the controls were subjects who were not hospitalized for influenza or pneumonia in the study period. the study took into account only the period of maximum incidence of ILI. the information obtained was validated by GPs\u2019 medical records. subjects were asked about their smoking and drinking habits. the influenza and pneumococcal vaccination status was checked by using the vaccination registers of GPs. p 0.05 was considered statistically significant. case-control study was performed in the elderly population (> 64 y of age) residing in Genoa (Italy) GPs randomly selected control subjects among patients registered in their databases. the study took into account only the period of maximum incidence of ILI. the 2010\u20132011 influenza season was considered. the characteristics of the study population were described as means standard deviation (SD) for continuous variables and as proportions for categorical ones. Vaccine effectiveness was calculated as IVE = [(1-OR)x100] and crude odds ratios with relative 95% Confidence Interval (CI) were estimated by conditional logistic regression models."}
