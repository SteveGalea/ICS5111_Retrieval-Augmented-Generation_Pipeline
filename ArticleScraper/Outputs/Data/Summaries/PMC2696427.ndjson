{"summary": "Background Anatid herpesvirus 1 (AHV-1) is an alphaherpesvirus associated with latent infection and mortality in ducks and geese. it is currently affecting the world-wide waterfowl production severely. a fluorescent quantitative real-time PCR (FQ-PCR) method was developed for fast measurement of AHV-1 DNA based on TaqMan MGB technology. AHV-1 is grouped in the alphaherpesviridae subfamily of the herpesvirus family. the viral genome is a linear, double-stranded DNA molecule approximately 180 kb in size. it is the highest reported for any avian herpesvirus in the alphaherpesviridae. TaqMan MGB probe contains a quencher dye that does not emit fluorescence within the detectable wavelength range. a TaqMan MGB-based real-time PCR method for detection and quantitation of AHV-1 is developed to serve as an alternative and improvement of the previously developed ordinary TaqMan real-time PCR method. standard curve of the AHV-1 fluorescent quantitative real-time PCR. dilutions of standard DNA ranging from 1.0 109 to 1.0 102 copies/L were used. the correlation coefficient and the slope value of the regression curve were calculated and are indicated. the results showed that the established FQ-PCR method was characterized by a wide dynamic range (8 logarithmic decades) of detection from 1.0 109 to 1.0 102 pAHV-1 plasmid copies/L with high precision. however, at lower and higher dilutions quantitation was not always reproducible compared to other properly diluted samples. 1.8 106 20.8 0.33 1.6 20.9 0.40 1.9 105 24.7 0.37 1.5 24.7 0.49 2.0 104 28.6 0.49 1.7 28.7 0.77 2.7 103 32.3 0.52 1.6 32.2 0.90 2.8 102 35.4 0.81 2.3 35.3 1.16 3.3 101 37.2 2.31 6.2 37.5 2.51 6.7 Test of established AHV-1 FQ-PCR using specimens. the MgCl2 concentration was balanced to 6 mM that provided optimal AHV-1 amplification. the optimized 25-L real-time PCR reaction system could be summarized as follows. the corresponding cycle threshold (CT) values are presented on the y-axis. each dot represents the result of triplicate amplification of each dilution. the correlation coefficient and the slope value of the regression curve were calculated. 102 pAHV-1 plasmid copies/L increased to more than 4% at viral DNA loads more than 1.0 109 pAHV-1 plasmid copies/L. the results demonstrated that the established fluorescent quantitative real-time PCR method was characterized by a wide dynamic range (8 logarithmic decades) of detection from 1.0 109 to 1.0 102 pAHV-1 plasmid copies/L with high precision. however, at lower and higher dilution tests were quantifiable without the need for further sample dilution or concentration. def cell culture supernatant 5.67 106/L DEF cell culture 1.05 109/L Allantoid fluid 2.85 106/L Liver 2.73 109/g Brain 2.20 107/g Bursa of Fabricius 9.47 109/g Thymus 1.09 109/g Spleen 3.59 109/g Esophagus 9.56 109/g Du the PCR is a rapid, sensitive and specific nucleic acid amplification technique. many conventional qualitative PCR methods for revealing merely the presence or absence of AHV-1 pathogen have been developed. however, the conventional PCR assays are not sufficient in a variety of clinical situations. they frequently encountered problems including the risk of cross-contamination (leading to false positives) and poor quality of extracts (leading to false negatives) the established AHV-1 detection method is more sensitive and reliable. it was able to detect as few as 1.0 101 DNA copies of template. the high quality hot start Taq DNA polymerase could minimize unspecific amplifications and increase the PCR cycling efficiency. the AHV-1 assay was highly reproducible and linear over a range of eight orders of magnitude from 102 to 109 copies. the results for intra- and inter-assay precision indicate that both intra-assay and inter-assay CVs were satisfactorily low and the assay is reproducible. the method described in this study is especially helpful for high throughput analysis such as evaluating the efficacy of antiviral drugs and experimental vaccines for AHV-1. anatid herpesvirus 1 (AHV-1, CHv virulent strain) was obtained from the Avian Disease Research Center of Sichuan Agricultural University (Yaan, Sichuan, China) the maximum virus titers could be obtained 48 h postinfection. DNA extraction from AHV-1 infected DEF cells and tissues of AHV-1 infected ducks was performed by using TIANamp Genomic DNA extracting kit. ctgggtacaagcgc 16 383\u2013398 Real-Ra Reverse ggccgggtttgcagaagt 18 399\u2013416 Con-Rb Reverse acaaatcccaagcgtag 20 246\u2013265 498 Con-Rb Reverse acaaatcccaagcgtag 17 727\u2013265 498 Con-Rb Reverse acaaatcccaag real-time PCR was performed in 25 L reaction mixture containing 1 PCR buffer, 0.2 mmol/L dNTPs, 1 U Taq and 1 L DNA template. the mixture was subjected to initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 50 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 15 s. the amplified 498 bp product underwent electrophoresis on 1.0% agarose gels. electrophoresis was carried out at 100 V in a mini-sub (Bio-Rad Corp., Hercules, CA, USA) gel electrophoresis was carried out at 100 V in a mini-sub gel electrophoresis unit. quantitative real-time PCR standard curve establishment The 498 bp conventional PCR target amplicon band on agarose gel was cut and the DNA was recovered and purified by TIANquick DNA Purification system (Tiangen Corp., Beijing, China) the product was ligated into pGM-T vector and transformed into E.coli DH5 competent cells. FQ-PCR sensitivity, specificity, reproducibility and dynamic range analysis Different 32 AHV-1 strains were examined with the established FQ-PCR method to test the sensitivity and compatibility of this method. the sensitivities of the conventional PCR and FQ-PCR were each determined using triplicates of different concentrations of recombinant plasmid pAHV-1. the assay was conducted by assessing the agreement between the replicates in five replicates (within-run precision) and in five separate experiments (between-run precision) of the serially diluted pAHV-1 recombinant plasmid samples. the lower and upper limits of quantification were defined by the pAHV-1 sample concentrations possessing reasonable precision.
