{"summary": "spinal cord injury is the highest cause of death in young people (15\u201329 years of age) there are currently no treatments which have a proven positive effect on neurological outcome [2, 3], following acute SCI. secondary damage due to early inflammatory responses after spinal cord injury is the main cause for neurological defects. NF-B is a dimer, typically a P50 / P65 heterodimer, and is the main component of the NF-B family involved in gene transcription. PPAR- could inhibit NF-B activation and promote proliferation and inhibit neural differentiation of endogenous neural stem cells. cAMP (Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate) was discovered in 1958 by Earl [20]. increased levels of cAMP lead to transient enhancement of transmitter release [21] and regulation of cAMP and cGMP together ensure coordinated development of one axon and multiple dendrites. PKA is implicated in the growth of axons and survival of newborn neurons [19, 23] animal experiments will be initiated to determine whether simultaneous activation of PPAR- and PKA could inhibit inflammation and promote neuronal formation. we aimed to determine the mechanisms underlying this recovery, as well as the balance between inflammatory cascade and generation of endogenous spinal cord neurons. the cells were proliferated and expanded in vitro for 1 passage. each time medium is changed and every passage flasks were changed to discard adherent cells. cDNAs were reverse-transcribed using the Trizol\u00aeRNA isolation reagent. the target gene fragments were amplified using real time-PCR. the target gene expression was normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. the membranes were developed using the ChemiDoc-It TM TS2 Imaging System (Bio-Rad) the membranes were developed using the ChemiDoc-It TM TS2 Imaging System (Bio-Rad), and relative optical density was analysed using the ImageJ2x software. cAMP levels were determined using an ELISA kit (GBD, Co.) SD rats exposed spinous lamina with sterile surgical instruments and spinal cord. rats were fixed on an operating table and subjected to instant impact against the spinal apparatus. the lower limbs shook, with the lower limbs bouncing and tail cocking and quickly falling. RNA was detected by electrophoresis before reverse transcription. OD260/280 was between 1.8 and 1.9. cDNA was used as a template for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis. samples were electrophoresed onto a 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel (SDS/PAGE) after blocking with 10% BSA in TBST at room temperature for 2 h, the membranes were incubated with the following primary antibodies at 4\u00b0C overnight. the membranes were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5000; Abcam) three sets of eye scissors and tweezers were prepared in sequence and placed in beakers with 75% alcohol. the skin was cut using the first scissors and both sides of the spine were cut from the rib fossa, from the bottom up, to remove the modified fascia and fat tissue attached to the spine. the spinal cord was then cut into 2\u20133 pieces by using the third pair of scissors. 105/ml spinal cord-derived stem cells were inoculated onto the surface of a sterile-10 Petri dish and incubated in medium containing DMEM/F12 + 2% B27 + 20 ng/ml b FGF + 20 ng/ml EGF. each time medium is changed and every passage flasks were changed to discard the adherent cells. the purity and quality of NSC were calculated by staining with Nestin/DAPI the target gene expression was normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) the membranes were then incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody, washed again, and exposed to ECL color development reagents. cAMP level was determined using an ELISA kit (GBD, Co.) three sets of eye scissors and tweezers were prepared in sequence. the skin was cut using the first scissors, and both sides of the spine were cut from the rib fossa, from the bottom up. derived stem cells were proliferated and expanded in vitro for 1 passage. the cells were separated mechanically by using 200-mesh sieve and centrifuged for 5 min (1000r/min) the supernatant was discarded and 2105/ml spinal cord-derived stem cells were inoculated onto the surface of a sterile-10 Petri dish. the target gene fragments were amplified using real time-PCR. the membranes were then incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody, washed again, and exposed to ECL color development reagents. cAMP was determined by ELISA after rosiglitazone treatment. the supernatants from the neural stem cell cultures were harvested. cAMP level was determined using an ELISA kit (GBD, Co.) the animals' bodies shook, with the lower limbs rapidly retracting and bouncing and tail cocking and quickly falling. the impacted local spinal cord surface was dark purple, and hind limbs appeared completely paralyzed postoperatively. cDNA was used as a template for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis. the target gene expression was normalized to that of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) membranes were incubated with anti-GAPDH (1:1000; Abcam), anti-MAP2 (1:800; Abcam), anti-NF-B (1:400; Abcam), and anti-NeuN (1:500; Abcam) the membranes were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5000; Abcam) for 2 h at 4\u00b0C. rosiglitazone was injected i.p., at 5 min, 6 h, and 24 h after SCI. forskolin (0.1 mg/kg/d; Abcam) was injected continuously for 7 days. rats were fixed on an operating table and subject to instant impact against the spinal apparatus. cDNA were reverse-transcribed using Revert Aid-First Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Thermo Scientific) cDNA was used as a template for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis. the membranes were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5000; Abcam) for 2 h at 4\u00b0C. the membranes were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5000; Abcam) statistical analysis All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS 14.0 software. the BBB scores for each animal were averaged and used to determine the group mean each day. comparisons between groups were performed by one-way analysis of variance. second generation of NSCs were selected from each group and cultured after adding rosiglitazone (1 mol/L) or G3335 (0.1 mol/L) cells were cultured for 3 days. NSC proliferation in the rosiglitazone group was significantly greater than that in the negative control group. tazone group (0.55 0.04) was lower than that in the vehicle (1.00 0.08) the expression of MAP2 mRNA in the rosiglitazone group (0.40 0.04) was lower than that in the vehicle (1.00 0.08), and when the activation of PPAR- is blocked, this inhibition could be partly reversed in rosiglitazone + G3335 (1.00 0.08) groups. 0.05, compared with vehicle group, and # P 0.05, compared with rosiglitazone group (one-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey\u2013Kramer multiple comparisons posttest) the activation of PPAR- could inhibit PKA expression (Figures 3(d) and 3(j) expression. rosiglitazone group showed significantly higher BBB scores. on day 28, all the groups showed the highest BBB scores since SCI. data were expressed as means SD (n = 3) PPAR- agonist rosiglitazone negatively regulates the neuronal formation. the rosiglitazone group (0.63 0.08; P 0.01, n = 3) showed the lowest expression of MAP2. azone group (1.58 0.07) were higher than other groups. forskolin alone showed no protective effect on mature neuron survive. lowest expression of NeuN was found in the forskolin group (0.92 0.41) NF-B expression between forskolin + rosiglitazone and rosiglitazone groups has no significant differences. rosiglitazone has the best protective effect on mature neuron survival. azone group and rosiglitazone + forskolin (R+F) group (0.470.04) showed the effects of PPAR- and representative western blots. each experiment was repeated at least three times. second generation of NSCs were selected from each group and cultured after adding rosiglitazone (1 mol/L) or G3335 (0.1 mol/L) cells were cultured for 3 days. the NSC proliferation in the rosiglitazone group was significantly greater than that in the negative control group. the expression of NF-B mRNA in the rosiglitazone group was lower than that in the vehicle (1.00 0.08) the expression of MAP2 mRNA in the rosiglitazone group was lower than that in the vehicle (1.00 0.08), and when the activation of PPAR- is blocked, this inhibition could be partly reversed in rosiglitazone + G3335 (1.00 0.08) groups (P 0.01; n = 3). expression level was significantly decreased in the rosiglitazone group. cAMP levels in cells treated with rosiglitazone (rosiglitazone group) are lower than vehicle group (5380.88367.74) cAMP levels in rosiglitazone + forskolin group were higher than rosiglitazone group. at 24 h point, the BBB scores of all groups were still not >2. on day 3, compared with the vehicle and rosiglitazone + forskolin groups, the group showed significantly higher BBB scores. mRNA expression of MAP2, NeuN, and NF-B was higher in the forskolin group (1.85 0.14) than in the other three groups (P 0.01, n = 3). PPAR- agonist rosiglitazone negatively regulates the neuronal formation, but the rosiglitazone group (0.63 0.08; P 0.01, n = 3) showed the lowest expression of MAP2. forskolin + rosiglitazone group (1.610.13) and the rosiglitazone group (1.58 0.07) were higher than other groups. PPAR- and PKA are simultaneously activated in forskolin + rosiglitazone groups. PPAR- and PKA are simultaneously activated in forskolin + rosiglitazone groups. NF-B expression between forskolin + rosiglitazone and rosiglitazone groups has no significant differences. rosiglitazone combined with forskolin has the best protective effect on mature neuron survival. rosiglitazone has the best protective effect on mature neuron survival. no difference was found between rosiglitazone and rosiglitazone + forskolin (R+F) group (0.470.04) and forskolin groups (0.250.04) each experiment was repeated at least three times. PPAR- can inhibit the activity of NF-B by binding to the subunits P65 and P50 of NF-B and competing for common transcription coactivators. PPAR- could also indirectly inhibit NF-B by activating transcription factor Nrf2 which reduces generation of prooxidative molecules that are required for NF-B activation. changes in cAMP levels in cells were measured by ELISA. we found a corresponding increase in the expression of PPAR- and PKA after applying rosiglitazone and forskolin. this suggests that rosiglitazone inhibits inflammation and promotes neuronal formation. neuroprotection by genistein against oxidative stress injury in cortical neurons occurs via inhibition of NF-B, JNK, and ERK signaling pathway. forskolin could attenuate the adverse effects of long-term Schwann cell denervation on peripheral nerve regeneration in vivo. in the present study, we found that forskolin could improve the number of nerve dendrites (MAP2 marker) in a SD rat spinal cord injury model. simultaneous activation of PPAR- and PKA elicited the best results in terms of BBB score. however, simultaneous activation of PPAR- and PKA was not as efficacious as activating PKA alone in promoting the generation of newborn neurons."}
