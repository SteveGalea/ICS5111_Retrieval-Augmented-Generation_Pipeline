{"summary": "innate immunity works by detecting pathogen-associated molecular patterns on invading viruses. all TLRs have N-terminal leucine-rich repeats that recognize pathogens and a C-terminal toll-interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain that mediates intracellular signaling to downstream TIR domain-containing adaptors. myD88 inhibits hepatitis B virus replication and restricts west Nile virus replication and spread in central nervous system neurons (29, 30) myD88 promotes adaptive immunity and enhances the CD8 T cell responses to vaccinia virus (31\u201333). virions are produced to regulate cellular signaling pathways with high expression of viral genes. high levels of RTA transcripts are detected within 2 h postinfection, followed by a dramatic decline 24 h later (41). During latency, a few gene products are expressed to limit the number of antigens that can be sensed by the immune system. RTA possesses ubiquitin (Ub) E3 ligase activity and targets IRF7 for proteasome-mediated degradation. RTA also degrades TRIF through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway to suppress double-stranded RNA-initiated activation of TLR-3 signaling. s were amplified from a BCBL1 cell cDNA library, inserted into pCMV-hemagglutinin (HA) at EcoRI and KpnI sites. pCR3.1-RTA encodes the full-length RTA. s were subcloned into the expression vector pCDH-flag.

GST-Sepharose beads were incubated with 1 mM PMSF at 4\u00b0C. pCR3.1-RTA was translated in vitro with a TNT-coupled transcription/translation system. iSLK cells harboring WT BAC16 were induced with 1 g/ml DOX for 5 days. well-grown TRE-BCBL1-RTA cells were induced by 1 g/ml DOX. cells were treated with 10 M MG132 for 24 h and lysed with denaturing lysis buffer. nM UBE1, 1 g GST-MyD88, 2 mM DTT, 2 mM energy regenerating solution containing ATP, and 5 mM MgCl2 in ubiquitination buffer for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. RESULTS RTA downregulates MyD88 expression. RTA decreased the level of endogenous MyD88 in a dose-dependent manner. iSLK cells were induced by DOX to induce RTA expression. qRT-PCR results showed that RTA did not change the MyD88 mRNA level. RNA was collected for reverse transcription and used to quantify MyD88 and actin by qRT-PCR. RTA alters MyD88 stability and degrades MyD88 through the proteasome pathway. previous experiments showed that RTA did not regulate MyD88 at the posttranscriptional level. anti-flag and anti-HA antibodies were used for Western blotting. values are calculated from the experiments shown in panel A. signal intensities first were normalized to the corresponding tubulin value and then normalized to the signal at 0 h. 293T cells were cotransfected with strep-tagged MyD88, His-tagged ubiquitin, and pCR3.1-RTA. after 24 h, cells were treated with MG132 for 16 h. RTA antibody coimmunoprecipitated endogenous MyD88 from the cells with DOX induction but not from the cells without induction. we further tested whether RTA bound to MyD88 directly. RTA synthesized in vitro interacted with full-length MyD88 fused with GST immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads. bacterially expressed GST alone and GST-MyD88 attached to beads were incubated with in vitro-translated RTA (lane 1). RTA binding to beads was detected by Western blotting. a previous study reported that RTA has E3 ligase activity. 293T cells were cotransfected with HA-tagged MyD88, WT RTA, and RTA mutants. proteins were collected for Western blotting. expression of MyD88 is impaired at early stages of primary de novo infection. KSHV miR-K5 was reported to inhibit MyD88 expression 7 days after KSHV infection of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) miR-K5 was expressed at a very low level 2 h and 6 h after KSHV infection, while it increased highly at 24 h. TRE-BCBL1-RTA cells were induced with DOX for 24 h and 48 h. RNA from BCBL1 cells was a positive control. TRE-BCBL1-RTA cells were mock induced or DOX induced for 24 h and 48 h.

RTA synthesized in vitro interacted with full-length MyD88 fused with GST immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads. blotting with anti-MyD88 antibody detected GST affinity binding. bacterially expressed GST alone and GST-MyD88 attached to beads were incubated with in vitro-translated RTA (lane 1). 145 failed to produce polyUb-conjugated bands that were as rich as those of wild-type RTA. results indicated that RTA functioned as an E3 Ub-ligase for MyD88. 293T cells were cotransfected with HA-tagged MyD88, WT RTA, and RTA mutants. KSHV miR-K5 was reported to inhibit MyD88 expression 7 days after KSHV infection of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) miR-K5 was expressed at a very low level 2 h and 6 h after KSHV infection, while it increased highly at 24 h.

DISCUSSION TLRs are important in microbe recognition. our results describe an efficient strategy for KSHV to impair the transmission of TLR signals by degrading the adaptor MyD88. a previous study found that KSHV infection of endothelial cells suppressed TLR4 transcription by viral G protein-coupled receptor (vGPCR), vIRF4 and ERK signaling (65), we also checked the TLR4 mRNA level in KSHV-infected primary HUVECs. ICP0 reduces MyD88 levels (74) but the mechanism by which ICP0 reduces MyD88 levels is unknown. a previous study found that MyD88 is downregulated by miR-K5 of KSHV 7 days after the infection. miR-K5 was expressed weakly at 2 h and 6 h postinfection. the expression increased as high as 20 times at 24 h compared with that at 2 h. this result suggested that miR-K5 levels were too low to repress MyD88."}
