{"summary": "102 volunteers experienced upper airway infection were recruited over the winter and early spring of 2008/2009. ninety-nine EBCs were successfully obtained and screened for 14 commonly circulating respiratory viruses. haled breath condensate (EBC) analysis has been explored as a new and non-invasive method to monitor lung inflammation and pulmonary disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, cystic fibrosis, lung cancer etc. 102 EBCs were collected from otherwise healthy volunteers showing respiratory or flu-like symptoms. the patient was instructed to breath orally at tidal volumes into a mouthpiece attached to a condenser for 10 minutes. saliva contamination was avoided by the presence of a one-way valve and the T-shaped section of the mouthpiece. the RTubeTM was connected by a custom made connecting-piece to the ECoVent (Jaeger, Germany) the device registers ventilatory parameters such as the exhaled volume, breathing frequency and tidal volume. a NS was obtained in parallel with the condensate collection from each patient. three specimens were excluded from the study due to incorrect condensate collection. amplification reaction mix contained 0.5 M forward primer (AdFW) and reverse primer (AdRV), 0.4 mM dNTPs, 10 l Buffer C and 1 U Taq polymerase in a final volume of 50 l. reactions were carried out in a T3000 Thermocycler 48 (Westburg, Leusden, The Netherlands) with an initial reverse transcription step for RNA viruses at 50\u00b0C for 30 min, followed by PCR activation nucleotide sequences have been deposited to GenBank under accession numbers [HM74039 to HM747056] reference HRSV RT-PCR primers HRSV-AF F 669-695 ctgtgatagarttccaacaaaagaaagaaaagaaca [8,9] HRSV-AF F 718-745 agttacacctgcattaacactaaattcc [8,9] HRSV-BN [4] PIV2 RV HN 1291-1310 argtcagacaatgggcaaat [4] PIV3 FW HN 762-781 ctgtaaactcagacttggta [4] PIV4 FW P 531-552 gaaagaggcttgggttacaca [21] PIV4 RV P 1147-1168 gctcttatcacagtctccaaa [6] a multiplex mix was prepared in a final volume of 25 l using 5 l extracted RNA, 12.5 l of Eurogentec one-Step Reverse Transcriptase qPCR master mix containing ROX as a passive reference. cRNA standards were constructed using the MEGAshortscript T7 kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) samples were collected using a commercially available condenser. the patient was instructed to breath orally at tidal volumes into a mouthpiece. saliva contamination was avoided by the presence of a one-way valve. RTubeTM was connected by a custom made connecting-piece to the ECoVent. the device registers ventilatory parameters such as exhaled volume, breathing frequency and tidal volume. a NS was obtained in parallel with the condensate collection from each patient. amplification reaction mix contained 0.5 M forward primer (AdFW) and reverse primer (AdRV), 0.4 mM dNTPs, 10 l Buffer C and 1 U Taq polymerase in a final volume of 50 l. PCR primers were located in conserved regions of the genomes of the respiratory pathogens. the VP4/VP2 partial region was amplified to confirm rhinovirus infection. the nucleotide sequences have been deposited to GenBank under accession numbers [HM74039 to HM747056].
