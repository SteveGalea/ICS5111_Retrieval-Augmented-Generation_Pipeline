{"summary": "the afp gene is a member of the family of albuminoid genes. the albuminoid genes evolved from a common ancestor. human AFP and human serum albumin share 40% identity with highly conserved cysteine residues. the present study is the first to report a high yield of recombinant human AFP (R-AFP) in a Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system. we also detected the bioactivity of R-AFP in the human liver cancer cell line Bel 7402. 10 millilitres of P1 baculovirus were added to 8 ml of Sf9 cells. secreted R-AFP was harvested in the medium at 72 h after infection. analysis of cytoplasmic R-AFP was analysed by SDS/PAGE. supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 13000 rpm for 60 min. supernatant containing R-AFP protein was further purified and analysed. purity of prepared AFP was 92.7% as determined recently. antibody against AFP and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody were purchased from Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd. (Shanghai) and Jackson ImmunoRes Lab, Inc., (U.S.A.) the eluted 6 His-tagged proteins were concentrated and purified by gel filtration chromatography using a Superdex 200 column. the proteins were analysed with a nanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (at 280 nm) and SDS/PAGE as described recently. laser confocal microscopy to observe expression of human AFP receptor in cells Expression of the human AFP receptor (AFPR) in the cell line was examined using a laser confocal microscope as described previously. a control group without AFP or HSA was also paralleled to be done. a total of 1.5 104 Bel 7402 cells per well were plated in 96-well plates. the cultured cell medium was replaced with medium without FBS for another 24 h. the cells were treated with human AFP (20 mg/l) for 48 h. the baculoviruses were harvested after the transfected Sf9 cells were incubated at 27\u00b0C for 7 days. one hundred microlitres of P1 baculovirus were added to 8 ml of Sf9 cells. secreted R-AFP was harvested in the medium at 72 h after infection. cell pellets were resuspended in 40 ml of HBS buffer, sonicated on ice for 15 min with 3 s/9 s intervals and then centrifuged at 13000 rpm for 60 min. supernatant containing R-AFP protein was further purified and analysed to determine expression level of secreted R-AFP. extraction of human cord blood AFP was precipitated by ammonium sulfate. purity of prepared AFP was 92.7% as determined by SDS/PAGE. target protein was electrophoretically separated by SDS/PAGE. the proteins were captured by Ni-charged resin (GE Healthcare Company, U.S.A.) and eluted with 300 mM imidazole in HBS buffer. eluted 6 His-tagged proteins were concentrated and purified by gel filtration chromatography using a Superdex 200 column. the results of the ELISA and Western blot assay showed the specific binding of the monoclonal antibody to human AFP and a lack of reaction to human albumin. the cells were incubated with a mouse anti-human AFPR antibody for 12 h, followed by incubation with secondary goat anti-mouse antibodies conjugated to FITC. ibre filter 4 h later using an LKB 1209 Rackbeta liquid scintillation counter. we used E-AFP as a positive control; blockage of anti-AFP and HSA as structural analogues was also assessed. a control group without AFP or HSA was also paralleled to be done. bacmid contained the pFastBac 1\u2013afp vector and confirmed homologous recombination occurred in the bacmid. analysis of baculovirus expression secreted R-AFP (in the insect medium) and cytoplasmic R-AFP (in the lysed insect cells) were assessed by SDS/PAGE. lane 1, native secreted R-AFP; lane 2, reduced secreted R-AFP; lane 3, reduced cytoplasmic R-AFP; lane 4, reduced cytoplasmic R-AFP. western blot analysis of baculovirus expression of R-AFP. R-AFP protein expression reached the highest level at a 1:100 volume of the infectious baculovirus inocula. n=10, *P0.05 compared with different infectious baculovirus. inoculas 1:500 volume groups examined the effects of R-AFP on cellular proliferation. we selected the human liver cell line Bel 7402 to examine the effects of R-AFP on cellular proliferation. the results showed that anti-AFP (40 mg/l) antagonized the effects of R-AFP and E-AFP. effects of R-AFP, E-AFP, anti-AFP and HSA on the incorporation of 3H-TdR into DNA and proliferation of Bel 7402 cells. the effects of R-AFP, E-AFP, anti-AFP and HSA on the incorporation of 3H-TdR into DNA and proliferation of Bel 7402 cells. analysis of expression vectors confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. pFastBac 1\u2013afp vector digested by BamHI and HindIII restriction enzymes. recombinant bacmid contained the pFastBac 1\u2013afp vector. non-reduced or native secreted R-AFP band tilted at approximately 67 kDa. reduced protein band was at approximately 69 kDa, consistent with the size of the afp gene. molecular mass of the cytoplasmic R-AFP bands was similar to that of the secreted R-AFP bands. luted chromatography position of R-AFP is shown in Figure 3(A) at a elution volume 15.0 ml. highest peak showed a high concentration of R-AFP (fraction C) purification process was successful. inocula has statistical difference compared with 1:500 volume groups. n=10, *P0.05 compared with different infectious baculovirus inoculas 1:500 volume groups. the peak of the increase reached 123.0% compared with the control group. anti-AFP (40 mg/l) antagonized the effects of R-AFP and E-AFP. as the concentration of R-AFP or E-AFP increased, the antagonizing effect decreased. control, 2. R-AFP (20 mg/l), 3. E-AFP (20 mg/l), 4. R-AFP (20 mg/l) + anti-AFP (40 mg/l), 5. HSA (20 mg/l), $P>0.05 compared with control groups. effects of anti-AFP to R-AFP and E-AFP on the proliferation of Bel 7402 cells were analysed by the MTT method. human AFP expressed in yeast was indistinguishable immunologically from authentic human AFP. the human AFP produced in yeast contains seven extra amino acid residues at the N-terminus that are not present in mature human AFP. this finding will aid clinical research on the immunomodulatory function of this protein. AFPR might activate cAMP and Ca2+ to stimulate the transduction of cellular signals to stimulate N-ras and c-myc expression. this leads to proliferation of NIH 3T3 cells and Bel 7402 cells. cytoplasmic human AFP could interact with signal molecules, such as caspase-3 [7], retinoic acid receptor- [23] and phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) all authors read and approved the final manuscript.
