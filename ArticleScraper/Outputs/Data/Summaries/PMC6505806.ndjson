{"summary": "feline infectious peritonitis is one of the most important viral diseases of wild and domestic cats worldwide. it is caused by the mutant FIP virus (FIPV) which originated from feline enteric coronavirus (FECV), a widespread agent associated with subclinical or transient gastrointestinal disease. cases that had tissue sections of telencephalon with basal nuclei, thalamus, brainstem, and cerebellum available were reviewed. all information was collected from the submission forms and autopsy reports, and archived histology slides were reexamined. the main neurologic signs included ataxia (8 cases, 31%), depression (7 cases, 27%), seizures (5 cases, 19%), head tilt (3 cases, 12%), urinary incontinence, incoordination, opisthotonus, muscle rigidity, recumbency (2 of 26 each, 8%), nystagmus, aggressiveness, anisocoria, and miosis (1 of 26 each, 4%). the main neurologic signs included ataxia (8 cases, no NE 11 12 MN DSH Ataxia, recumbency, depression, miosis Cerebellar herniation No Mixed 12 12 MN Ragdoll Nystagmus, head tilt, seizures, aggressiveness Hydrocephalus (lateral) and cerebellar herniation Yes NE 13 10 MN Siamese Ataxia, urinary incontinence Flattening of gyri Yes NE 15 6 MN DSH Head tilt Hydrocephalus the most common distribution of pathologic changes in the brain was periventricular encephalitis (12 cases, 46%) followed by rhombencephalitis (8 cases, 31%), and diffuse leptomeningitis with superficial encephalitis (6 cases, 23%) perivascular accumulations of lymphocytes and plasma cells were admixed with a variable number of foamy or epithelioid macrophages and neutrophils. the most common pattern was A. periventricular encephalitis, followed by B. rhombencephalitis, and C. diffuse leptomeningitis with superficial encephalitis. ent Absent LP LP LP/VL Absent SS Periventricular encephalitis B (\u2013) + 6 N/Hi MX LP/Hi N/Hi Absent MX/AC/MG/SS Absent Periventricular encephalitis UO (+) + 7 LP/Hi/VL LP/Hi/VL LP/Hi Absent Absent Absent Rhombencephalitis NA + 9 MX/VL MX/VL LP Absent SS Absent Absent Absent Rhombencephalitis B (+) + 17 LP/N/EM/VL LP/N/EM Absent LP/SS Absent Absent Absent Rhombencephalitis B (+) + 18 LP/N/FM/VL LP/VL LP/VL LP/N/EM N/Hi LP/N/SS Absent Absent Absent Absent Absent Absent Absent Absent Absent Absent Absent Absent the leptomeninges are markedly expanded by fibrin and inflammatory infiltrate that extends into the overlying neuroparenchyma. the leptomeninges are markedly expanded by fibrin and inflammatory infiltrate that extends into the overlying neuroparenchyma. the wall of the leptomeningeal venule is expanded by fibrinoid change and cell debris. there is extensive neuronal necrosis with astrocytosis and areas of neuronophagia. periependymal macrophages exhibit strong immunostaining for feline coronavirus antibody. age of FIP-affected cats varied from 2 to 36 mo (mean 12.3 mo) no sex or breed predisposition was noted. 2,001 cats were submitted for autopsy between 2005 and 2015. the most common of such changes was hydrocephalus (10 cases) the fact that 7 of these 10 cases were classified in the periventricular encephalitis group suggests inflammation within or around the ventricular system has a major role in the development of ventricular obstruction and secondary hydrocephalus. three distinct distributions of neurohistopathologic changes were observed. periventricular encephalitis, rhombencephalitis, diffuse leptomeningitis with superficial encephalitis. the reason for these 3 variations remains elusive. antibody detection in blood, effusion, and CSF, or direct viral detection by FAT of effusion samples have been widely used to support a clinical diagnosis of FIP. but laboratory tests have been shown to be unreliable given the frequent false-negative results."}
