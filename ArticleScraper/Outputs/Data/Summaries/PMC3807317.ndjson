{"summary": "a total of 108 cases of infection with MERS-CoV have been confirmed. most infections were geographically linked to the Middle East. the virus is suspected to persist in animal reservoirs and cause zoonotic infections in humans. studies suggest cleavage of mature full-length S glycoprotein into an amino-terminal domain (S1) and an 85-kDa carboxy-terminal domain (S2) that is putatively anchored to the membrane. cDNA containing the entire gene sequence encoding MERS-CoV S was obtained by DNA synthesis. pIIIH5red-S and -SHA, the S coding gene sequences (MERS-S/SHA) are placed under transcriptional control of the vaccinia virus promoter PmH5. repetitive sequences are designed to remove the mCherry marker by intragenomic homologous recombination (marker gene deletion) anti-HA tag monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies from cynomolgous macaques suggested synthesis of recombinant SHA and S proteins in CEF and vero cells. recombinant viruses could be handled under biosafety level 1 conditions. monoclonal anti-HA tag antibody confirmed the production of a protein doublet of 200 to 210 kDa in cells infected with MVA-MERS-SHA. the molecular masses of the 200- to 210-kDa polypeptides detected by SDS-PAGE were significantly higher than the 149 kDa predicted for MERS-CoV S protein. peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) or endoglycosidase H (endo H) was treated with PNGase F, which removes all N-linked oligosaccharide chains from glycoproteins. this treatment reduced the 210-kDa protein doublet to a protein band of 150 kDa. serum samples tested for their capacity to neutralize MERS-CoV in tissue culture infections by using 200 50% tissue culture infective doses. even a single application of MVA-MERS-S induced low levels of virus-neutralizing antibodies in all eight animals tested. ERS-CoV virus-neutralizing titers (VNT) were determined 20 days after primary immunization (A) and 10 days after the second immunization (B and C) using Huh7 (A and B) and Vero cells (C) sera obtained after the second boost were also tested against SARS-CoV on Vero cells (D). the proP1.0 server indicated three possible furin cleavage sites at amino acid positions 751, 887, and 1113 of MERS-CoV S. we favor putative cleavage at amino acid 887 since this cleavage would produce a predicted S2 subdomain of 54.5 kDa. prominent endo H resistance of the 85-kDa S2 subdomain suggests that S cleavage occurs predominantly during or after passage through the Golgi apparatus. the safety and protective capacity of MVA-MERS-S immunization should be tested in animal models that reproduce MERS-CoV infections in humans. however, the current absence of suitable preclinical models recommends the development of an MVA vaccine delivering MERS-CoV S. MVA-MERS-S and MVA-MERS-SHA were isolated in plaque passages by screening for transient coexpression of the fluorescent marker gene mCherry. repetitive sequences (del) are designed to remove the mCherry marker by intragenomic homologous recombination (marker gene deletion) polyclonal antibodies from a cynomolgous macaque (anti-MERS-CoV) detected a protein with an estimated molecular mass of about 200 kDa in lysates from. MERS-CoV-infected cynomolgous macaque (anti-MERS-SHA) detected a protein with an estimated molecular mass of about 200 kDa in lysates from. MERS-CoV a protein doublet of 200 to 210 kDa was confirmed in cells infected with MVA-MERS-SHA. a second protein of about 85 kDa was also confirmed. the molecular masses of the 200- to 210-kDa polypeptides were significantly higher. peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) or endoglycosidase H (endo H) was treated with PNGase F, which removes all N-linked oligosaccharide chains from glycoproteins. this treatment reduced the 210-kDa protein doublet to a protein band of 150 kDa. serum samples were tested for their capacity to neutralize MERS-CoV in tissue culture infections by using 200 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID50) in vero cells or 100 TCID50 in Huh-7 cells. even a single application of MVA-MERS-S induced low levels of virus-neutralizing antibodies. iters (VNT) were determined 20 days after primary immunization (A) and 10 days after the second immunization (B and C) using Huh7 (A and B) and Vero cells (C) sera obtained after the second boost were also tested against SARS-CoV on Vero cells (D). we considered furin cleavage sites because spike proteins of some betacoronaviruses and all gammacoronaviruses are typically activated by intracellular furin-dependent cleavage. the proP1.0 server indicated three possible furin cleavage sites at amino acid positions 751, 887, and 1113 of MERS-CoV S. we favor putative cleavage at amino acid 887 since this cleavage would produce a predicted S2 subdomain the safety and protective capacity of MVA-MERS-S immunization should be tested in animal models that reproduce MERS-CoV infections. the current absence of suitable preclinical models recommends the development of an MVA vaccine delivering MERS-CoV S."}
