{"summary": "Xpert flu/RSV XC and Xpert Xpress flu/RSV assays are rapid, random-access molecular tests capable of detecting and differentiating influenza A, influenza B, and RSV viruses from nasal wash fluid samples/aspirates and NP swabs. the Xpress test targets multiple segments of RNA for each influenza virus to increase sensitivity and specificity. nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs tested (n = 201) were collected from 197 symptomatic patients. patients were seen as inpatients (n = 69), in outpatient clinics (n = 66), and in the emergency department (n = 66). nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs tested (n = 201) were collected from 197 symptomatic patients. patients were seen as inpatients (n = 69), in outpatient clinics (n = 66), in the emergency department (n = 66), 11 to 18 (n = 9), 19 to 64 (n = 81), 65 to 74 (n = 19) and 75 (n = 17) years. the influenza A/B virus and RSV A/B LDTs used primer and probe sequences previously described for influenza A and influenza B viruses (5) and separately for RSV A and RSV B (6). the sample tube was vortexed for 5 s rather than inverted 5 times to reduce the risk of contamination. KU1, parainfluenza 2, and parainfluenza 3. TABLE 1. Xpert Flu/RSV and Xpress assays versus LDT, all analytes Assay and result LDT result (no. of samples) (n = 200) + \u2013 Flu/RSV XC + 142a 0 \u2013 8b 50 Xpress + 150 0 \u2013 0 50 a Influenza A 2009 H1N1 (n = 29), influenza A this difference was found to be significant (unpaired t test, P 0.0001). the mean LDT CT value of the 57 concordant RSV-positive results was 22.39 (95% CI, 21.1 to 23.7); for the 4 specimens that tested negative only by Xpert Flu/RSV XC assay, it was 35.1 (95% CI, 32.8 to 37.5). compared data from package inserts for each test reveals lower limits of detection for the Xpress test for each virus. the Xpress cartridge provides a result in 63 min, while the Xpress test provides a result in only 32 min."}
