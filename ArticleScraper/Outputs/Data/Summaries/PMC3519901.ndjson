{"summary": "a cell's proteome is dependent on the location of the cell, different stages of its life cycle or environmental conditions. a cell's proteome is dependent on the location of the cell, different stages of its life cycle or environmental conditions. a cell's proteome reflects the specific alterations of the pathways induced by infection. SILAC involves labeling two separate cultures, one light (L) and one heavy (H) with isotopically differentiated essential amino acids. an advantage with SILAC is the early mixing of samples, which reduce sample-to-sample variability. SILAC has been recently used in virus studies to explore secretory pathway of host cells in coronavirus replication [11], and examining influenza virus [13]. host ribosomes produce viral proteins to produce progeny virions. interactions with host interferon-regulated proteins help to switch production of transcripts needed for replication to production of progeny virions. infection of the cell with reovirus will cause differential regulation of many host proteins. a small percentage of these proteins were significantly differentially regulated at each time point. biological functions and network analysis were performed using DAVID bioinformatics resource [24], [25], as well as Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. cell death, cell growth and proliferation, molecular transport, gene expression, and inflammatory response pathways are most affected by MRV infection. SILAC Infection Approximately 107 L-labeled cells in T75 flasks were infected with T1L at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 PFU per HEK293 cell. titers of samples were determined by plaque assays as previously described. cells were harvested at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 24, 30, 36, 48 and 72 hours post infection. aliquots were combined with Trypan Blue solution (Sigma, cat#T8154-100ML) at 1 1 ratio. a hemocytometer was used to count a total of 200 cells. xio Observer Z1 inverted microscope using 20 objective and fluorescence illumination using Exfo Xcite. both L and H cells were mixed, and mixed cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS. samples were digested with 6 g of sequencing grade trypsin overnight at 37\u00b0C. a different protein standard was used in the first experiment compared to the second and third experiments. protein quantitation Within each experiment, proteins identified with L:H ratios were normalized using z-score analysis, described previously [13] each protein's ratio was then converted to a z-score using the formula: where b represents a single protein in the dataset. z-score measures standard deviation units (a ratio is from the mean) focus proteins were overlaid onto a global molecular network developed from information contained in the Ingenuity Pathways Knowledge Base. networks of these focus genes were then algorithmically generated based on their connectivity. the network genes associated with biological functions and/or diseases were considered for the analysis. the secondary antibodies were the appropriate horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit (Cell Signaling, cat#9176) and -BAD (Santa Cruz, cat#sc-8044) the viruses were grown and titrated in mouse L929 cell monolayers in Joklik's Suspension Modified Minimal Essential Medium (J-MEM) supplemented with 5% feta SILAC Infection Approximately 107 L-labeled cells in T75 flasks were infected with T1L at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 PFU per HEK293 cell. flasks were incubated at 4\u00b0C for one hour, with gentle rocking every 10\u201315 minutes. SILAC Infection Approximately 107 L-labeled cells in T75 flasks were infected with T1L at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 PFU per HEK293 cell. titers of samples were determined by plaque assays as previously described. cells were infected with either T1L or T3Dc, mock infected, or treated with 100 g/ml puromycin to act as a positive control. cells were harvested at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 24, 30, 36, 48 and 72 hours post infection. anti-fade reagent (Invitrogen, cat#D1306) was added to each spot before slides were covered with coverslips. slides were examined on a Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 inverted microscope. 100 g of each digested protein sample was loaded onto a 1100 mm XTerra C18 column. both eluents contained 20 mM ammonium formate pH 10. a different protein standard was used in the first experiment compared to the second and third experiments. concatenated fractions collected from the first dimension high pH reversed-phase (RP) fractionations were analyzed separately by low-pH RP LC with on-line ESI/TOF Quadupole MS/MS detection (QStar Elite) as previously described. protein quantitation Within each experiment, proteins identified with L:H ratios were normalized using z-score analysis. proteins determined differentially regulated by statistical analysis were tabulated in Excel. each gene identifier was mapped to its corresponding gene object in the Ingenuity Pathways Knowledge Base. each gene identifier was mapped to its corresponding gene object in the Ingenuity Pathways Knowledge Base. focus proteins were overlaid onto a global molecular network developed from information contained in the Ingenuity Pathways Knowledge Base. network genes associated with biological functions and/or diseases were considered for the analysis. the secondary antibodies were the appropriate horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit (Cell Signaling, cat#9176) and -BAD (Santa Cruz, cat#sc-8044) reovirus successfully infects HEK293 cells. each of five different cell lines (L929, A549, HEK293, CaCo2 and Hela) were infected at MOI = 1 PFU/cell with T1L (a) or T3D (b) cell lysates were harvested at 0, 24, 48 and 72hpi and titrated. hek293 cells were then re-analyzed as in (a) and (b) after infection. both strains generated similar final titers by 48 hpi. this is within the time frame we elected for SILAC analysis. HEK293 cells were examined microscopically. cells were stained for f-actin (red), reovirus (green), and DAPI (blue) at 8, 12, 18 and 24 hpi, 5.31%, 64.0%, 83.2% and 100% of cells were infected, respectively. an MOI of 5 T1L would infect the majority of HEK 293 cells. overlapping numbers represent those proteins identified in more than one biological replicate. most proteins are seen at a 11 ratio after infection, indicated by the peak of the population distribution indicated at 0. For clarity, only experiment 1 at 24hpi is shown. 200 proteins were observed differentially regulated in at least one experiment at 6 hpi. 153 proteins were differentially regulated at 24hpi. up-regulated proteins found in more than one experiment are listed in Table 1 and Table 2. several proteins, such as SCG2, IFIT2, OAS3 and BAD, were identified in only two experiments but were significantly up-regulated in both experiments. more focus was placed on those proteins identified in more than one experiment; however, proteins identified in only one experiment were also used to analyze infection-induced alterations in host pathways. 55959029 UBE2T ubiquitin conjugating enzyme 2.03 1.19 22671717 HBA2 hemoglobin alpha-2 2.02 3.58 55660909 SC23B Sec23 homolog B (S. cerevisiae) 2.00 1.21 29792115 SMAD3 SMAD, mothers against DPP homolog 3 (Drosophila) 1.99 2.01 48734878 Q6IPH7 RPL14 protein 1.97 1.85 7020506 UB2 gene trap locus 3 (mouse) 1.50 0.95 54696534 ATPO ATP synthase, H+ transporting, mitochondrial F1 complex, O subunit (oligomycin sensitivity conferring protein) 1.50 1.59 7705411 YTHDF2 YTH domain family, member 2 1.47 0.99 9623363 DPOE3 DNA polymerase epsilon p17 subunit 1.46 55962775 S10AD S100 calcium binding protein ynein light intermediate chain 2, cytosolic) (LIC53/55) (LIC-2) 0.93 1.56 31652283 ACO13 thioesterase superfamily member 2 0.87 1.65 31880783 PELO pelota homolog 0.77 1.40 18490917 SCG2 Secretogranin II (chromogranin C) 7.62 4731861 OAS3 2\u2032\u20135\u2032oligoadenylate synthetase 3 5.46 14550514 59 0.80 9295343 MRRP1 HNYA 0.61 1.31 13112017 Q9BTT9 GYS1 protein 0.62 0.88 45501009 Q6NWZ1 CKAP4 protein 0.62 0.91 13938553 KAD6 TAF9 RNA polymerase II, TATA box binding protein (TBP-associated factor), 32kDa 0.63 0.91 30354279 AKTS1 AKT1S1 protein 0.63 1.02 48855 kinase 2) (p164 ROCK-2) 0.81 0.67 36122 RPB2 RNA polymerase II 140 kDa subunit 0.84 0.62 27503838 TPPC5 Trafficking protein particle complex 5 0.85 0.58 15559560 BGLR Glucuronidase, beta 0.87 0.69 56203612 ARFG3 OTTHUMP00000028526 0.88 0.70 50415798 Q6DC98 LMNB1 protein 0.89 0.53 SG15, OAS3, SCG2, PTPN12 and STAT1 were seen at a 11 infected to mock ratio in all three experiments. HnRNPA1, another protein shown by SILAC not to be differentially regulated, with ratios of 1.020.14, was seen in Western blot with ratios of 1.36 and 1.02 at 6 and 24hpi. all of the proteins tested by Western blot were also identified at 24hpi in SILAC. most of the Western blot results correlated to the regulation of the proteins observed in SILAC (whether or not they are up or down regulated) we obtained metabolic and biological functions that are enriched for each list of proteins uploaded at 95, 99, and 99.9% confidence cutoffs respectively. at 6hpi, the top functions that were most affected by the differentially regulated proteins included transforming growth factor -receptor, activation of pro-apoptotic gene products, cis-trans isomerase activity, late endosome functions and serine protease inhibitor processes. top network functions generated using Ingenuity protein analysis for HEK293 cells infected with reovirus at (a) 6hpi and (b) 24hpi. Graphs represent host cell functions with highest score (x-axis) based on the number of differentially regulated proteins observed in that particular function network. the proteins seen up-regulated in this canonical pathway are those having a role in the early phase of virus infection, functioning in antiviral innate immunity. reovirus successfully infects HEK293 cells. each of five different cell lines (L929, A549, HEK293, CaCo2 and Hela) were infected at MOI = 1 PFU/cell with T1L (a) or T3D (b) each of five different cell lines (L929, A549, HEK293, CaCo2 and Hela) were harvested at 0, 24, 48 and 72hpi and titrated. reovirus strains generated similar final titers by 48 hpi. both strains generated similar final titers by 48 hpi. a recent study indicates that T1L may also have oncolytic relevance. HEK293 cells were infected with MRV strain T1L at MOI 5. cells were stained for f-actin (red), reovirus (green), and DAPI (blue) at 8, 12, 18 and 24 hpi, 5.31%, 64.0%, 83.2% and 100% of cells were infected. 1296 and 1026 proteins were identified, with a total of 2992 unique species and 1194 (39.9%) found in two or more replicates. more proteins were identified in the first experiment because of greater sample loading. lower sample loading led to a decrease in the numbers of proteins identified in the second and third replicates. z-score analysis used 95%, 99% and 99.9% cutoffs. 200 proteins were observed differentially regulated in at least one experiment. 153 proteins were differentially regulated at 24hpi (104 up and 49 down regulated) proteins identified in all three experiments at 24hpi were significantly up-regulated in two of the three experiments, and slightly up-regulated in the third. there were also numerous proteins, such as SCG2, IFIT2, OAS3 and BAD. amyloid beta peptide-binding protein 2.22 1.86 4885217 XPF excision repair cross-complementing rodent repair deficiency, complementation group 4 2.08 55959029 UBE2T ubiquitin conjugating enzyme 2.03 1.19 22671717 HBA2 hemoglobin alpha-2 2.02 3.58 55660909 SC23B Sec23 homolog B (S. cerevisiaee) 2.00 1.21 29792115 SMAD beta'-actin 1.53 1.46 56205198 SNAPN SNAP-associated protein 1.53 1.01 55962100 B1AN89 eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 gamma, 3 1.51 0.94 13477351 CP080 Gene trap locus 3 (mouse) 1.50 0.95 54696534 ATPO ATP synthase, H+ transporting, mitochondrial F1 complex, O subunit (oligomycin sensitivity conferring protein) 1.

SILAC:WB discrepancies may have been caused by inherent differences in sampling. infected cells were harvested at 24hpi, lysed with 0.5% NP-40, and 20\u201380 g of each cytosolic fraction resolved in each lane of 106.50.1 cm 10% SDS-mini-PAGE. most of the Western blot results correlated to the regulation of the proteins observed in SILAC (whether or not they are up or down regulated) functional categories were obtained from both GO and Panther terms. we obtained metabolic and biological functions that are enriched for each list of proteins uploaded at 95, 99, and 99.9% confidence cutoffs respectively. top biological processes included transforming growth factor -receptor, activation of pro-apoptotic gene products, cis-trans isomerase activity and late endosome functions. top networks generated for each of the separate biological experiments were molecular transport, DNA replication and repair, post translational modification and infectious disease. this indicates that the host cell proteome changes, signifying host-virus interactions are continuously shifting depending on the stage of the virus life cycle. the higher the score, the greater the number of proteins differentially regulated in that particular function network. 105 based on the average z-score analysis at 24hpi. a number of proteins were identified by SILAC, and many were up-regulated. a number of proteins were identified by SILAC, and many were up-regulated. the host cell's response to infection changed during the virus life cycle. at 24hpi, molecular transport, DNA replication and repair, post-translational modification and inflammatory response are more prominently affected. the host response to viral infection produced more up regulated proteins than down regulated ones. cytosolic pattern recognition receptors pathway was shown to be significantly altered after 24 h indicating this pathway is important in reovirus infection. up-regulated proteins in this pathway are RIG-1, ISG15, MAVS, STAT1 and ISG-54 (also known as IFIT2). reoviruses are currently being explored as oncolytic therapy because the virus preferentially replicates in cells with abnormal Ras-signaling pathways and induces apoptosis significantly more in these cells. reoviruses are currently being explored because the virus preferentially replicates in cells with abnormal Ras-signaling pathways. ubiquilin 1 (UBQLN1) and cullin 4A (CUL4A) were up-regulated and down-regulated respectively. in HEK293 cells, ubiquilin 1 decreases degradation of p53 [46] and cullin 4A increases degradation of p53. another hub at 6hpi in network 2 is of interest with respect to MRV and cancer therapy. all except PTPN12 are associated with other viral infections. the only protein identified in the TNF alpha hub that was down-regulated, namely PTPN12, is also the only protein that has not yet been reported in any other viral infections. OAS3, identified in Network 1 at 24hpi, may also have an important role in T1L infection. it has antiviral properties in other viral infections, such as dengue, tick-borne encephalitis and chikungunya virus. we have used SILAC to identify a number of new candidate proteins. ISG15 has not previously been identified as affected by MRV infections, but has been identified in numerous other viral infections [35], [36]. numerous other ISG-like proteins have been observed for reovirus [34]. reoviruses are currently being explored as oncolytic therapy because the virus preferentially replicates in cells with abnormal Ras-signaling pathways and induces apoptosis significantly more in these cells. the possible role of MRV-induced p53-mediated oncolysis is only partially understood. a hub at 6hpi in network 2 is of interest with respect to MRV and cancer therapy. the protein plays a role in other viral diseases such as SIV encephalitis [49]. APOE (isoform 4) is protective against some infections, such as chronic hepatitis C. it allows faster disease progression for HIV, and worse disease symptoms for herpes simplex latencies. APOE is essential for initial HCV infectivity [57] SILAC analysis of up (a, b) or down regulated (c, d) proteins using average z-scores from all three biological replicates. at 6hpi (a, c) top biological processes included positive regulation of interferon-alpha production, defense response to virus by host, interferon-mediated immunity and procollagen-lysine 5-dioxygenase activity. table shows individual protein z-scores found for each of the three biological replicates, as well as the average L:H ratios for all three experiments. a protein is included in this table if at least half of the biologic z-score values are 1.960. there are no major disagreements between biological replicates."}
