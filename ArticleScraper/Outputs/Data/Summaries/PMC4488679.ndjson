{"summary": "the use of antibodies as therapeutics was conceived long before the development of MAb technology. passive immunity, i.e., the transfer of antibodies from the serum of an immunized person or animal to a non-immunized one, was first demonstrated more than 120 years ago in a pioneering experiment by Behring and Kitasato. human-derived or humanized MAb-based preparations exhibit significantly decreased incidence of side effects and viral contamination. despite the potential of MAbs as powerful tools in the fields of infectious diseases and toxins, only one MAb has been approved for the prevention of a viral infection (RSV) and one MAb has been approved for the treatment of bacterial toxin (anthrax) MAbs exhibit unprecedented specificity to their antigenic target, but this extreme specificity may hamper the efficacy of any individual MAb in the case of the absence or modification of its target epitope in a mutant or subtype of the infectious agent. this inferior neutralizing potency of individual MAbs may be attributed to the differences in the functional impact of specific antigenic epitopes. the standard treatment for botulism relies on equine or limited amounts of human PAb-based antitoxin therapy. there is a need for safe and reliable anti-BoNT MAb-based pharmaceutical drugs. the importance of Ab affinity, the molecular structure of IgGs involved in MAb-antigen ICs clearance, and the unexpected contribution of individual non-neutralizing MAbs to the synergistic neutralizing effect. 4 100 in vivo [8] 2\u20135 10,000 c in vivo [23] 2\u20134 >100 in vivo [24] 2 10 in vivo [25] 2 1 in vitro [26] 2 40 in vivo [27] 7 150 in vivo [16] 2 d 166 in vivo [28] Botulinum B 2\u20134 No e in vivo [29] 2\u20133 30 in vivo [30] 2\u20137 the combination of three MAbs enabled protection of the mice 7.5 h after exposure compared with 1 h for each MAb alone. the combination of three MAbs enabled protection of the mice 7.5 h after exposure compared with 1 h for each MAb alone. the interaction between two MAbs is considered synergistic if the FIC index is 1.0, additive if the FIC index is equal to 1, indifferent if the FIC index is between 1 and 2, and antagonistic if the FIC index is >2. a synergistic drug combination should facilitate the reduction of drug doses while maintaining efficacy. the best combination for anti-serotype E MAbs displayed a very high synergistic neutralizing activity of up to 400-fold over that of its components. the best combination for anti-serotype E MAbs, which protected against 125,000 MsLD50 of toxin A, had a 154-fold improvement over that of its components. anti-serotype E MAb panel: seven [B-4, B-2, B-1, B-3, B-6, B-5, and B-7], two (B-1) [B-4 and B-1], and two (B-5) [B-4 and B-5] anti-serotype E MAb panel: eight [E-2, E-3, E-4, E-5, E-6, E-7, E-8, and E-1], four-EP [epitope recognition-based MAbs E the induction of neutralizing synergism might be explained by at least three putative mechanisms. the simultaneous binding of interfering MAbs to multiple functional sites on the toxin. this binding alone is generally considered as \u201cneutralization\u201d. functional neutralizing epitopes Toxin neutralization has been considered to be primarily due to the binding of the Ab to the toxin, blocking its activity. this simultaneous blockade increases the probability that these MAbs will interfere with interactions between the toxin and its target cell, ultimately resulting in either additive or synergistic neutralization. a tripartite exotoxin composed of protective antigen (PA), lethal factor (LF) and edema factor (EF) showed that PA-binding antibodies effectively limit B. anthracis pathogenicity. it was demonstrated both for PA and for LF that binding of specific protective epitopes is required for neutralization [47,64,65,66] in rare cases, a single MAb can be as protective as a PAb-based preparation [53,70] via the blockade of a pivotal epitope that results in complete neutralization. interfering with more than one such epitope might be highly beneficial for toxin neutralization. a combination of MAbs that recognize distinct functional domains on BoNTs may represent the general principle for a potent synergistic effect. a combination of MAbs that recognize different functional domains on BoNTs is more likely to synergize than a combination of MAbs recognizing the same functional domain. ricin subunit contains two galactose binding sites that function independently and are distant from one another [34,73]. a single RTB-specific MAb may block both galactose binding pockets by binding to similar conformational epitopes sharing both domains. the 50 kDa LC acts as a zinc-dependent endopeptidase. the 100 kDa HC is composed of two distinct functional domains. TeNT acts via a dual receptor model in which gangliosides and glycosylated proteins are involved. a pair of protective and non-protective MAbs were shown for a pair of a protective and non-protective MAbs against anthrax. the protective MAb inhibited furin cleavage and subsequent oligomer formation, whereas the enhancing MAb did the opposite. the enhancing MAb did the opposite. chimeric simian-human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (SHIV-vpu1) is a chimeric simian-human immunodeficiency virus. the most potent neutralization of triple combinations evaluated was attained using three MAbs directed against three different domains. a combination of four MAbs found higher neutralization potency and a higher degree of synergy than any of the triple combinations. a combination of two human MAbs neutralized SARS-CoV in a synergistic manner by recognizing different epitopes on the receptor-binding domain. fHBP has proved to be a virulence factor for N. meningitidis and a target for functional bacterial antibodies. combination of MAbs that individually do not display neutralizing activity may exert a synergistic neutralizing effect due to either the steric hindrance of adjacent neutralizing epitopes or partial or full epitope redundancy that is overcome by simultaneous binding. several findings suggest that certain combinations of MAbs bind to a toxin much more strongly than each MAb alone. anti-BoNT/A-Hc neutralizing MAbs examined were very high affinity [81]. the most potent anti-Hc scFv showed the highest affinity for its epitope [82] Scott characterized a panel of anti-tetanus toxin scFvs and found that 14/15 clones neutralized toxin activity based on a ganglioside binding assay. the strength of multivalent interactions (functional affinity or avidity) usually exceeds, sometimes greatly, the corresponding intrinsic affinity [85,86] multivalent links within ICs can be formed between either the same epitope expressed on separate antigens and Ab molecules of the same specificity (MAb) or between diverse epitopes and Abs with two or more specificities (such as in case of natural immune reactions), which may have cooperative interactions between them. a conformational change in the antigen upon the binding of anti-E1 MAb to a multisite antigen may result in a substantial increase in overall affinity via two basic mechanisms. the binding of anti-E1 MAb to a multisite antigen facilitates cross-linking, thereby increasing the probability that an anti-E2 MAb would bind to two sites instead of to only one site. scFvs exhibited synergistic binding based on competitive binding studies. scFvs reduced toxin activity without recognizing the Hc domain. scFvs reduced toxin activity without recognizing the Hc domain. yousefi et al. detected synergistic neutralizing effects of one pair of MAbs, but not other pairs, that recognized two distinct but very close or overlapping epitopes within the GT1b-binding fragment of TeNT. one MAb promoted bivalent binding of another MAb to PA, presumably by bridging two PA monomers. this phenomenon would substantially increase antibody avidity, i.e., the combined strength of multiple bonding interactions, resulting in syn low affinity FcRs on resident macrophages may be more relevant than high affinity FcRs. in human liver, low affinity FcRII and FcRIII were detected on both Kupffer cells and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. high affinity FcRI is not expressed in liver macrophages. the clearance of ICs following a polyclonal response occurs via two pathways. one is mediated by Fc-receptor (FcR) binding. the other is mediated by the complement system, which plays a crucial role in IC handling. the elimination of foreign Fc from equine antitoxin preparations serves to lower immunogenicity. however, polyclonal F(ab')2-based preparations protect against toxin challenge without activating Fc-mediated effector functions. a high dose of F(ab')2 may compensate for the lack of Fc-mediated mechanisms and may induce neutralization solely via toxin blocking. et al. showed that F(ab')2 fragments of an anti-PA MAb were 10- to 100-fold less potent than the complete IgG in neutralizing anthrax toxin in vitro. the addition of FcR-blocking antibodies greatly reduced the activity of this MAb. in vivo, significantly higher concentrations of F(ab')2 did protect against anthrax toxin cytotoxicity. authors hypothesize that MAb PA-FcRs ICs are endocytosed and sorted to lysosomes for degradation. but the differences in efficacy between the isotypes implied a difference in Fc-mediated effector functions rather than defective endocytosis in mice deficient in FcRs. chimeric mouse/human variant indicating that mouse Fc regions perform better than human Fc in mice. findings indicated that neither the Fc region nor the presence of an FcR on the target cell influence the Ab-mediated protection of individual cells. however, in vivo, the presence of an FcR enhanced their protective efficacy. several studies conducted by the lab of Charles Shoemaker directly investigated the phenomenon of synergistic neutralization mediated by increased Fc valence. Sepuldeva et al. proposed a novel concept in which BoNT neutralization is exerted by combinations of high-affinity epitope-tagged scFvs against BoNT/A, serving as the \u2018blocking\u2019 arm, and anti-tag MAbs containing Fc, serving as the \u2018clearing Fc\u2019 arm an anti-tag clearing Fc was comparable to that of a polyclonal antitoxin serum. the clearance occurs via FcR and CR pathways, both involve antibody Fc. a MAb cocktail might mimic a polyclonal reaction by forming large ICs with multiple Fc toxin decoration. izing monomeric VHH units, each containing two tags instead of one, enabled the simultaneous binding of four Fc domains to the toxin. the resulting clearance dramatically enhanced the protection of mice from virtually no protection in the absence of the clearing Fc to complete protection against 1000 MsLD50 of BoNT/A. the significance of Fc valence for toxin clearance from the circulation was recently shown using red blood cells (RBCs) mediated toxin sequestration. this immune adherence may prevent pathogens from leaving the bloodstream. this immune adherence may prevent pathogens from leaving the bloodstream. independent of whether the HP pair contained a CR1-binding or nonbinding control MAb. this may indicate that enhanced BoNT clearance from the blood circulation by fixed tissue macrophages is attributed to the opsonization of multiple Fc domains in the HP complexes. toxins have been believed to be neutralized by antibodies not by indirect mediated measures but rather by a direct \u201cinterfering\u201d antibody-dependent mechanism. neutralization has been considered to be primarily due to the binding of the Ab to the toxin, blocking its activity. a combination of MAbs may facilitate the binding of multiple IgG molecules to the target cell, thus potentially blocking various essential functional domains. this simultaneous blockade increases the probability that these MAbs will interfere with interactions between the toxin and its target cell. PTx-neutralizing Abs bind to its S1 and S2/3 subunits. epitope specificity is the primary determinant of the ability of an antibody to neutralize ricin. non-neutralizing MAbs targeted random loops and coils largely localized to domain 3 [69] the potency of an individual MAb is substantially lower than that of a PAb. the combination of protective MAbs targeting different epitopes on a toxin molecule can synergize protective efficacy. the concurrent blockade of these types of epitopes might synergistically \u201cshut down\u201d essential functional pathways of the toxin, such as binding to its receptor target. a pair of MAbs recognized different non-overlapping epitopes of BoNT/B synergized with the other two MAbs that recognized non-overlapping epitopes in Syt II (the protein receptor) the combination of the latter two MAbs did not exert a synergistic effect [30]. a single RTB-specific MAb may block galactose binding pockets by binding to similar conformational epitopes sharing both domains. the authors speculated that MAbs might bind to domains that interrupt the transport of RTA from the ER to the cytosol. they also determined that the synergistic effect of the MAb pairs depended on different ricin neutralization activities. gangliosides and glycosylated proteins, such as the synaptic vesicle proteins SV2A and SV2B, are involved. in one pioneering study, Volk et al. evaluated the effect of MAbs on different TeNT subunits and found that all neutralizing MAbs bound to epitopes on the HC of TeNT (approximately half of them to the C-terminal region and half to the N-terminal region protective and non-protective MAbs act in concert to abrogate PA oligomerization, thus preventing translocation of LF and EF into the cell to cause subsequent toxicity. the protective MAb inhibited furin cleavage and subsequent oligomer formation, while the enhancing MAb did the opposite. bs against SEB and evaluated different pairs of MAbs. only one or none of the MAbs individually protected against SEB toxicity. this was the first report in which enhanced protection against SEBILS was demonstrated in mice. fHBP is a virulence factor for N. meningitidis and a target for functional bactericidal antibodies. the MAbs recognized two overlapping epitopes that were part of the hFH binding site on the N-terminus of the hFBP. they did not elicit complement mediated bactericidal activity against MenB. a combination of MAbs may facilitate the binding of multiple IgG molecules to the target toxin. this blockade increases the probability that these MAbs will interfere with interactions between the toxin and its target cell. it has been demonstrated that particular domains on different toxins are associated with enhanced neutralization. pertussis toxin (PTx) is a major virulence factor. PTx-neutralizing Abs bind to its S1 and S2/3 subunits. epitope specificity is the primary determinant of the ability of an antibody to neutralize ricin. a combination of protective MAbs targeting different epitopes on a toxin molecule can synergize protective efficacy. the concurrent blockade of these types of epitopes might synergistically \u201cshut down\u201d essential functional pathways of the toxin, such as binding to its receptor target. this phenomenon is expected to be more prominent when important neutralizing epitopes perform redundant functions. three neutralizing MAbs recognized different non-overlapping epitopes of BoNT/B. a MAb that responded to the ganglioside receptor binding site synergized with the other two MAbs that recognized non-overlapping epitopes in Syt II (the protein receptor) a combination of the latter two MAbs did not exert a synergistic effect. a single RTB-specific MAb may block galactose binding pockets by binding to similar conformational epitopes sharing both domains. the authors speculated that MAbs might bind to domains that interrupt the transport of RTA from the ER to the cytosol. they also determined that the synergistic effect of the MAb pairs depended on different ricin neutralization activities that were more related with their epitope specificities than their ricin-binding sylated proteins, such as the synaptic vesicle proteins SV2A and SV2B, are involved [74] in a pioneering study of MAb combinations against toxins. the authors hypothesized that the large number of epitopes found to be involved in neutralization suggested that different antibodies block distinct steps in toxin function. the combination of a protective and non-protective MAbs abrogates PA oligomerization. the protective MAb inhibited furin cleavage and subsequent oligomer formation. however, the enhancing MAb did the opposite. the authors reported that protection was achieved when these MAb combinations were administered simultaneously. these MAbs recognized non-continuous residues that likely contribute to conformational epitopes. the phenomenon of synergistic neutralization due to blockade of functional non-overlapping epitopes is not restricted to toxins. fHBP is a virulence factor for N. meningitidis and a target for functional bactericidal antibodies. the MAbs recognized two overlapping epitopes that were part of the hFH binding site on the N-terminus of the hFBP. they did not elicit complement mediated bactericidal activity against MenB. adherence to the toxin would be more efficacious if the binding of the antibody to its epitope were stronger, thus prolonging the duration that this epitope is occupied. adherence to the toxin would be more efficacious if the binding of the antibody to its epitope were stronger. anti-tetanus toxin scFvs found that 14/15 clones neutralized toxin activity based on a ganglioside binding assay. this effect was strongly related to the affinity of these clones. this results suggest that high affinity may be a necessary but not sufficient parameter of neutralizing potency [16]. the binding of one bivalent MAb to two epitopes on two soluble antigens, thereby facilitating their cross-linking, increases the probability that a second MAb, specific for an independent epitope, could bind to two sites instead of to only one site. this phenomenon was demonstrated 30 years ago by Moyle et al. for antibodies against human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) a conformational change in the antigen on the binding of anti-E2 MAb increases the probability that an anti-E2 MAb would bind to two sites instead of to only one site. nowakowski et al. elegantly linked synergistic toxin neutralization to enhanced affinity of MAbs to boNT/A HC. the authors reported a synergistic effect resulting in a more than 20,000-fold increase in potency for the three-MAb combination compared with any individual MAb. the authors suggested that the synergy in binding stems from conformational changes in the toxin upon binding of one scFv that favors binding of the next. binding of the first antibody thermodynamically facilitated binding of the second antibody. one MAb promoted bivalent binding of another MAb to PA, presumably by bridging two PA monomers. bridging via one MAb promotes bridging via the other. a common characteristic of all anti-BoNT/A-Hc neutralizing MAbs examined was a very high affinity for its epitope [82]. a panel of anti-tetanus toxin scFvs showed that 14/15 clones neutralized toxin activity based on a ganglioside binding assay. this effect was strongly related to the affinity of these clones. 'functional affinity' refers to higher order complexes between bivalent or multivalent Abs and a number of binding sites per antigen. the strength of multivalent interactions (functional affinity or avidity) usually exceeds, sometimes greatly, the corresponding intrinsic affinity [85,86] multivalent linkages within ICs can be formed between either the same epitope expressed on separate antigens and Ab molecules of the same specificity (MAb) or between diverse epitopes and Abs with two or more specificities binding of the first antibody may induce a more stable conformation of the antigen that thermodynamically favors the binding of a subsequent antibody. binding of multiple MAbs to a multisite antigen facilitates cross-linking, thereby increasing the probability that an anti-E2 MAb would bind to two sites instead of to one site. xin neutralization potency was demonstrated by determining the functional binding affinities for each single MAb, each pair of MAbs, and the mixture of all three MAbs. the resulting affinity of the MAb combination was 200-fold higher than the individual MAbs alone. the equimolar cocktail of all three MAbs further increased the affinity by 4-fold. yousefi et al. detected synergistic neutralizing effects of one pair of MAbs, but not other pairs, that recognized two distinct but very close or overlapping epitopes within the GT1b-binding fragment of TeNT. one MAb promoted bivalent binding of another MAb to PA, presumably by bridging two PA monomers. this phenomenon would substantially increase antibody avidity, i.e., the combined strength of multiple bonding interactions, resulting in syn c-decorated antigen is the basis for the effective clearance of ICs. low affinity FcRII and FcRIII were detected on both Kupffer cells and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. adherence of individual MAbs to an antigen (such as a toxin) would be expected to form relatively small ICs. the clearance of ICs following a polyclonal response occurs via two pathways. one mechanism is mediated by Fc-receptor (FcR) binding. the second mechanism is mediated by the complement system. these two mechanisms can act independently. the elimination of foreign Fc from equine antitoxin preparations serves to lower immunogenicity. however, polyclonal F(ab')2-based preparations protect against toxin challenge without activating Fc-mediated effector functions. this protection suggests that a high dose of F(ab')2 may compensate for the lack of Fc-mediated mechanisms. xin neutralization activity was abrogated by blockers for PAb and MAb treatment. it is unclear whether this potency reduction in vivo is also attributed to the shorter half-life of the F(ab')2 fragments. the authors hypothesized that MAb PA-FcRs ICs are endocytosed and sorted to lysosomes for degradation. the differences in efficacy between the isotypes implied a difference in Fc-mediated effector functions rather than defective endocytosis in mice deficient in FcRs. b protected more strongly than its chimeric mouse/human variant, indicating that mouse Fc regions perform better than human Fc in mice. compared the neutralizing and protective activity of anti-SEB MAbs in vivo and in vivo. studies conducted by the lab of Charles Shoemaker directly investigated the phenomenon of synergistic neutralization mediated by increased Fc valence. in this manner, the investigators elegantly illuminated the critical contribution of Fc-mediated clearance of BoNTs to synergistic neutralization. the authors showed that for individual non-neutralizing scFvs, the addition of additional clearing Fcs synergically increased the level of protection against BoNT/A. scFvs combined with an anti-tag clearing Fc were comparable to that of a polyclonal antitoxin serum. the clearance of ICs occurs via FcR and CR pathways, both involve antibody Fc. ing of two non-neutralizing monomeric VHH units enabled the simultaneous binding of four Fc domains to the toxin. the resulting clearance dramatically enhanced the protection of mice from virtually no protection in the absence of the clearing Fc to complete protection against 1000 MsLD50 of BoNT/A. the significance of ricin clearance from the circulation was recently shown using red blood cells (RBCs) mediated toxin sequestration. this immune adherence may prevent pathogens from leaving the bloodstream. this immune adherence may prevent pathogens from leaving the bloodstream. ICs are formed when soluble IgGs bind to a target antigen. they are removed rapidly in part by the reticuloendothelial system (fixed mononuclear phagocyte system) and by certain circulating leukocytes that express receptors for the ICs. the clearance of ICs is thought to play an important role in toxin neutralization. the antibody is thought to be protected from degradation, thereby increasing the half-life of IgG in serum. the use of antitoxin agents that do not bear Fc would be expected to exhibit reduced efficacy due to a rapid decrease in the concentration of the antitoxin agent in the bloodstream. the elimination of foreign Fc from equine antitoxin preparations serves to lower immunogenicity. the generation and characterization of an FcR-humanized mouse was described. this model may enable the accurate prediction of the consequences of linking human FcRs to IgGs for a particular biological response. experiments conducted by Arturo Casadevall and colleagues have broadened our understanding of the function of Fc in anti-PA antibodies. they found that the efficacy of antibody-mediated neutralization was dependent on the isotype and that this neutralization activity required a competent FcR. they showed that the IgG2a MAb prevented lethal toxin cytotoxicity more efficiently than the IgG1 MAb and that passive immunization with IgG2a MAb protected wild the authors obtained similar results for a MAb directed against the B subunit of Stx2. they compared the in vitro and in vivo effects of intact Ig and Fab fragments derived from PAb and anti-A chain MAb preparations. IgG MAb and its F(ab')2 fragment (50 pmol/mouse) were incubated with increasing amounts of BoNT/A ranging from 10 to 100 MsLD50. the intact IgG MAb protected 100% of the mice from a challenge of up to 50 MsLD50 BoNT/A, whereas its F(ab')2 fragment protected against only 10 MsLD50 of the toxin. thus, the protective efficacy of F the improvement achieved by the inclusion of an additional tag resulted from further Fc decoration of the toxin. the definitive role of Fc-mediated clearance in synergistic activity was demonstrated by pharmacokinetic studies. authors generated small (12 kDa) and stable camelid heavy-chain-only Ab VH (VHH) domains against BoNT/A. co-administration of recombinant anti-BoNT tagged VHH and an anti-tag clearing Fc was insufficient to induce efficient clearance. authors compared neutralizing or non-neutralizing binding VHHs administered with or without clearing Fc. the addition of a clearing Fc agent to double-tagged VHH heterodimers significantly increased the protection of mice from ricin toxicity, likely via the promotion of toxin clearance. the presence or absence of an anti-tag clearing Fc linked to a high affinity heterodimer consisting of two non-neutralizing VHHs afforded the mice no protection against ricin challenge. two HPs given in combination had 166-fold greater potency than un-modified MAbs. the ICs formed with an HP and an un-modified MAb were less potent than those formed with two HPs. this may indicate that enhanced BoNT clearance from the blood circulation by fixed tissue macrophages is attributed to the opsonization of multiple Fc domains in the HP complexes. studies have shown that different combinations of MAbs against various toxins and other infectious agents indeed exhibit enhanced efficacy. in many cases, this enhancement is synergistic, occasionally exceeding the efficacy of the PAb-based preparations that are generally used. screening for toxin-neutralizing MAbs should involve high-affinity MAb combinations to avoid overlooking them. the synergistic activity of a MAb combination may depend on the presence of Fc and on the Fc isotype."}
