RBI was determined using the GelDoc Imaging System Band Quantification Software. Error bars indicate the range of values obtained from two independent experiments. cell viabilities are expressed as mean SD. images were obtained at 24 hpi (200 magnification). titrations are expressed as mean SD. cell viabilities were determined by trypan blue exclusion. hek293T cells were treated with DMEM containing 10% FBS alone. hek293T cells were incubated at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2. supernatants were dispensed into the murine IFN- and IL-6. blot analyses were performed using whole cell lysates of extract-treated RAW264.7 cells. epimedium koreanum Nakai significantly upregulated the phosphorylation of IRF-3, STAT1, TBK1, p65, p38 and ERK. phosphorylation of IRF3 is a key indicator of interferon signal transduction. treatment with the epimedium koreanum Nakai extract can induce potent IRF3 phosphorylation at 8 hpt. this increased STAT1 phosphorylation indicates the active functions of the ISGs. phosphorylation of these molecules is comparable to that obtained with LPS treatment. an IFN- real-time PCR assay was performed to monitor time-dependent changes in mRNA expression. after normalization to GAPDH, the extract-treated cells displayed a seven-fold increase in the level of IFN- mRNA at 8 hpt and a nine-fold induction level at 12 hpt compared with untreated cells. the transcriptional levels of various antiviral genes were up-regulated by Epimedium koreanum Nakai at 12 hpt, including Mx1, GBP-1 and PML. at 8 hpt, the IL-6 and OAS-16 transcriptional levels were up-regulated by 15-fold and 8-fold, respectively. mice were orally treated with Epimedium koreanum Nakai at 20 g per head in a total volume of 200 L before infection with lethal doses of influenza A subtypes. the untreated mice showed a 20% body weight loss between 5 and 7 dpi and had begun to recover their lost weight by 8 dpi, returning to their normal state by 13 dpi. 5-week-old female mice were orally administered with 0.1 mg/mL Epimedium koreanum Nakai (EKN) in a total volume of 200 L (20 g/head) at 1, 3 and 5 days before infection with 5 MLD50 (A) H1N1; (B) H5N2; (C) H7N3; and (D) H9N2 Influenza A subtypes. mL and 1.5 log TCID50/mL, at 3 dpi and 5 dpi, respectively. epimedium koreanum Nakai induced the antiviral state, which is sufficiently strong to inhibit viral replication and promoted the survival of mice against lethal infections of diverse influenza A viruses. RAW264.7 cells treated with media alone, 5.0 g/mL Quercetin, or 1000 unit/mL recombinant mouse IFN-, 12 h prior to infection with PR8-GFP at an MOI of 1.0 The GFP expression images were obtained at 24 hpi. plants as medicines date to the earliest years of man\u2019s evolution [31,32,33], therefore poses less safety-related concerns. a larger number of these plants have shown beneficial preventive and therapeutic effects, including anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, anti-bacterial, and immune-modulatory properties. in particular, the anti-influenza virus effects of several herbal extracts have been reported. virus in immune cells (RAW264.7) and epithelial cells (HEK293T) increased survival rate of mice subjected to lethal challenges with different influenza A virus subtypes, including H1N1, H5N2, H7N3 and H9N2. all of the mice in control groups displayed more than 25% losses within 9 dpi. interferon and pro-inflammatory cytokine production can have both beneficial and harmful effects depending on the amount, timing and duration of cytokine release. robust cytokine production (cytokine storm), excessive inflammatory infiltrates, and virus-induced tissue destruction all contribute to morbidity and mortality. however, an induced antiviral state by tight regulation will be a very important defense mechanism against virus infection [50] phosphorylation can lead to the rapid production of type I IFNs and various inflammatory cytokines that play a pivotal role in stimulating the antiviral state and subsequent clearance of viruses. endotoxin (LPS) is a known immunomodulator and is often a contaminant in biological preparations. this may be due to contamination from bacterial endotoxin (LPS or lipid A-associated protein) 293T cells are epithelial cells which are less known for their relationship with the immune system. it is known that HEK293T cells have less prominent pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), especially toll-like receptors (TLRs) this suggests that for activating the HEK293T cells, an active compound/s must penetrate the cell membrane and activate the receptors present in the cytoplasm. treatment with total aqueous extract of Epimedium koreanum Nakai showed a striking anti-viral effect both in vitro, and in in vivo animal models. the optimum dosage of Epimedium koreanum Nakai for practical application and the longevity of the effect within the host should be examined. extracts inhibited the replication of VSV-GFP (MOI = 0.005) and HSV-GFP (MOI = 2.0) by 50% at EC50 values of 1.12 0.31 g/mL and 1.41 0.41 g/mL in HEK293T cells. the selection indexes of Epimedium koreanum Nakai (SI) for PR8, VSV, NDV and HSV on HEK293T cells were 15.5, 17.8, 29.8 and 23.5 respectively. the extract could be broadly useful as a prophylactic or therapeutic agent. the expression of the Matrix gene mRNA in the extract-treated cells was decreased in a time-dependent manner compared with the untreated group at 6\u201324 hpi. the total aqueous extract of Epimedium koreanum Nakai is able to reduce the replication of the VSV, PR8, and HSV viruses in RAW264.7 cells. the relative band intensity (RBI) of M-mRNA expression from the same experiment was determined using the GelDoc Imaging System Band Quantification Software. Error bars indicate the range of values obtained from two independent experiments. cell viabilities are expressed as mean SD. koreanum Nakai (EKN), or 1000 unit/mL recombinant human IFN-, 12 h prior to infection with (A) VSV-GFP; (B) HSV-GFP at an MOI of 1.0 and 3.0, respectively. titrations are expressed as mean SD. cell viabilities were determined by trypan blue exclusion. epimedium koreanum Nakai induced the secretion of IFN- and IL-6 in HEK293T cells. the secreted amount was significantly high, and in line with human IFN-treated positive controls. the results suggest that Epimedium koreanum Nakai can stimulate immune cells and epithelial cells. immunoblot analyses were performed using whole cell lysates of extract-treated RAW264.7 cells. epimedium koreanum Nakai significantly upregulated the phosphorylation of IRF-3, STAT1, TBK1, p65, p38 and ERK. phosphorylation of IRF3 is a key indicator of interferon signal transduction. rylated IRF3 translocated into the nucleus and initiated the transcription of type I interferons (IFNs) the produced type I interferons (IFNs) binds to the JAK-STAT pathway, leading to the phosphorylation of STAT1 and the transcriptional activation of interferon-stimulated gene (ISGs) these activated ISGs are involved in controlling viral infection. an IFN- real-time PCR assay was performed to monitor time-dependent changes in mRNA expression. the extract-treated cells showed a seven-fold increase in the level of IFN- mRNA at 8 hpt and a nine-fold induction level at 12 hpt compared with untreated cells. the transcriptional levels of various antiviral genes were up-regulated by Epimedium koreanum Nakai at 12 hpt using specific primers. the results suggest that Epimedium koreanum Nakai has the capacity to up-regulate the transcription levels of IFN-. a minimum effective dose of 20 g per head was chosen based on our previous in vivo experiments with various herbal extracts. the mice were orally treated with Epimedium koreanum Nakai at 20 g per head in a total volume of 200 L before infection with lethal doses of influenza A subtypes. the control group succumbed to death by 9 days post infection. 5-week-old female mice were orally administered with 0.1 mg/mL Epimedium koreanum Nakai (EKN) in a total volume of 200 L (20 g/head) at 1, 3 and 5 days before infection with 5 MLD50 (A) H1N1; (B) H5N2; (C) H7N3; and (D) H9N2 Influenza A subtypes. extract-treated groups had significantly reduced viral titers 2.1 log TCID50/mL and 1.5 log TCID50/mL, at 3 dpi and 5 dpi, respectively. results indicate that Epimedium koreanum Nakai induced the antiviral state, which is sufficiently strong to inhibit viral replication. treatment of quercetin (5.0 g/mL) had marked increase in cytokine secretion in RAW264.7 cells. these data strongly suggest that quercetin might induce the antiviral state in cells and subsequent inhibition of virus replication. the use of plants as medicines dates to the earliest years of man\u2019s evolution [31,32,33], and therefore poses less safety-related concerns. a larger number of these plants have shown beneficial preventive and therapeutic effects, including anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, anti-bacterial, and immune-modulatory properties. in particular, the anti-influenza virus effects of several herbal extracts have been reported. the total aqueous extract of Epimedium koreanum Nakai inhibited the replication of influenza (Figure 1B), VSV (Figure 1A and Figure 2A), NDV (Figure 1C), and HSV (Figure 1D and Figure 2B) viruses in immune cells (RAW264.7) and epithelial cells (HEK293T) the majority of mice in the control groups displayed more than 25% losses within 9 dpi. interferon and pro-inflammatory cytokine production can have both beneficial and harmful effects depending on the amount, timing and duration of cytokine release. robust cytokine production (cytokine storm), excessive inflammatory infiltrates, and virus-induced tissue destruction all contribute to morbidity and mortality. an induced antiviral state by tight regulation will be a very important defense mechanism against virus infection [50] phosphorylation can lead to the rapid production of type I IFNs and various inflammatory cytokines that play a pivotal role in stimulating the antiviral state. endotoxin (LPS) is a known immunomodulator and is often a contaminant in biological preparations. this may be due to contamination from bacterial endotoxin (LPS or lipid A-associated protein) human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cells are less known for their relationship with the immune system. it is known that HEK293T cells have less prominent pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), especially toll-like receptors (TLRs) for activating the HEK293T cells, an active compound/s must penetrate the cell membrane and activate the receptors present in the cytoplasm. treatment with total aqueous extract of Epimedium koreanum Nakai showed a striking anti-viral effect both in vitro, and in in vivo animal models. optimum dosage of Epimedium koreanum Nakai for practical application should be examined to obtain a better protection against viral infections. s and therapeutic applications in humans and livestock."}
