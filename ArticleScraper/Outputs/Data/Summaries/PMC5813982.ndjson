{"summary": "the respiratory viral profile of the patients with healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) has not yet been elucidated. the prevalence and clinical impact of respiratory virus infection in adult patients with HCAP has not been elucidated. recent studies have indicated that many patients defined as having HCAP were not infected with MDR pathogens [6\u201310], indicating that HCAP settings might present unique risks of pneumonia. incidence of viral pneumonia has increased during the past decade [13], in part, this apparent increase reflects improved diagnostic techniques. CAP from January 1 to December 31, 2016 were prospectively recruited. patients excluded from the study if they had pneumonia related to witnessed aspiration during eating or vomiting, obstructive pneumonia related to airway obstruction by a tumor, or ventilator-associated pneumonia. patients who did not undergo any microbiological studies before antibiotic administration were also excluded. all patients were tested for respiratory virus by multiplex reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) if the patients had no sputum, RT-PCR was conducted on a nasopharyngeal specimen. patients excluded from the study if they had pneumonia related to witnessed aspiration during eating or vomiting, obstructive pneumonia related to airway obstruction by a tumor, hospital-acquired (HAP) or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) patients who did not undergo any microbiological studies before antibiotic administration were also excluded. urinary antigen tests for Streptococcus pneumoniae and PCR tests for Mycoplasma pneumoniae were performed when indicated by the attending physician. all patients were tested for respiratory virus by multiplex reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR), using all available respiratory specimens. 55 patients who visited the emergency department due to pneumonia were excluded from the study because the microbiological specimens obtained prior to antibiotic administration were unacceptable (n = 37), or due to absence of RT-PCR results (n = 9); or withdrawal of informed consent (n = 3) the baseline characteristics of 452 patients (HCAP: 224 patients; CAP: 228 patients) are shown in Table 1. male sex 279 (62.7) 142 (63.4) 137 (60.1) 0.470 Age, years 70.5 (15.0) 72.4 (11.5) 68.6 (17.6) 0.006 BMI, kg/m2 21.8 (4.2) 21.1 (4.1) 22.4 (4.3) 0.002 Ever-smoker 120 (26.5) 49 (21.9) 71 (31.1) 0.026 Alcoholism 52 (11.5) 16 (7.1) 36 (15.8) 0.004 In the army 7 0.001 Pneumonia severity index 105.6 (36.3) 123.0 (29.8) 88.3 (34.0) 0.001 CURB-65 2 234 (51.8) 137 (61.2) 97 (42.5) 0.001 CURB-65 3 81 (17.9) 50 (22.3) 31 (13.6) 0.016 qSOFA 2 57 (12.6) 46 (20.5) 11 (4.8) 0.001 Direct sub-ICU admission 35 (7.7) 24 (10.7) significant differences between patients with CAP and HCAP were tested using chi-square, or Fisher\u2019s exact test. data are mean (SD), number (%) patients, or median (range) in both HCAP and CAP groups, influenza A was the most common respiratory virus, followed by entero-rhinovirus. the general viral profile of patients with HCAP and CAP were similar, except for influenza A and adenovirus. virus 3 5 (2.1) 3 (2.2) 2 (2.0) 1.000 Adenovirus 8 (3.4) 0 (0.0) 8 (7.9) 0.001 Coronavirus 7 (3.0) 5 (3.7) 2 (2.0) 0.702 Coronavirus 229E 1 (0.4) 1 (0.7) 0 (0.0) 1 (1.0) 0.430 +Coronavirus OC43 5 (2.1) 4 (3.0) 1 (1.0) 0.394 Bacterial Multi-bacterial 27 (11.5) significant differences between patients with CAP and HCAP were tested using chi-square, or Fisher\u2019s exact test. data are mean (SD), number (%) patients, or median (range) seasonal variation curve of viral infections was similar to that in the CAP group, except for adenovirus and human metapneumovirus. more than half (63.6%) had a history of influenza vaccination. x-axis shows each month and y-axis shows the number of observed pneumonia events. viral infection did not affect the clinical prognosis in the HCAP group. the hospital LOS (p = 0.377), mortality (p = 0.930) and discharge rate to a nursing home (p = 0.184) pathogens related to pneumonia were identified in 235 (52.0%) patients. among them, 107 (23.7%) patients had bacterial pneumonia. 87 (19.2%) patients had viral, and 41 (9.1%) patients had viral\u2013bacterial coinfection. chronic kidney disease 35 (7.7) 21 (9.4) 14 (6.1) 0.198 Ischemic heart disease 74 (16.4) 46 (20.5) 28 (12.3) 0.018 Congestive heart failure 18 (4.0) 10 (4.5) 8 (3.5) 0.603 Chronic lung disease 109 (24.1) 35 (15.6) 74 (32.5) 0.001 Bronchiectasis 25 (5.5) 5 (2.2) 10 (0.4) 0.002 COPD 62 (13.7) 23 (10.3) 39 significant differences between patients with CAP and HCAP were tested using chi-square or Fisher\u2019s exact test. data are mean (SD), number (%) patients, or median (range) 430 (95.1%) patients were tested for respiratory viruses in sputum or endotracheal aspirates. the remaining 22 (4.9%) patients underwent RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal specimens. 4 (0.9%) patients underwent pleural effusion RT-PCR. otracheal aspirate RT-PCR. the viral profiles, according to respiratory specimens, are shown in S2 Table. 0.149 Pseudomonas aeruginosa 24 (10.2) 20 (14.9) 4 (4.0) 0.006 MRSA 21 (8.9) 18 (13.4) 3 (3.0) 0.005 MSSA 16 (6.8) 8 (6.0) 8 (7.9) 0.557 Escherichia coli 12 (5.1) 2 (2.0) 0.059 Haemophilus influenzae 8 (5.2) 1 (1.0) 0.142 Enterobacter cloacae 6 (2.6) bacterial pneumonia was significantly higher in patients with HCAP than in those with CAP. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were more frequently observed in HCAP than in CAP patients. seasonal variation curve of viral infections was similar to that in the CAP group. median length of hospital stay (LOS) was 8.2 (range: 0.0\u2013120.0) days. patients with HCAP had significantly longer LOS than did patients with CAP. CAP group had a higher mortality than did the CAP group. to date, only limited studies have evaluated the viral profile of patients with HCAP. however, these studies only included patients with severe pneumonia requiring ICU care focusing on the CAP. however, these studies only included patients with severe pneumonia requiring ICU care focusing on the CAP. however, they did not strictly control the respiratory sampling time. the CAP group may have had a higher chance of infection by respiratory viruses, especially influenza. more than half of the patients (63.6%) had a history of influenza vaccination. influenza subtype H3N2 was detected in 5 (11.4%) patients. bacterial pathogens identified in 35.7% of patients with HCAP and 11.8% of patients with CAP. PCR detected significantly more Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. HCAP is the most important predictor for MDROs (OR 14.2, 95% CI 1.734\u2013115.9, p = 0.013) unlike previous studies. a limited number of invasive respiratory specimens was available in this study. sputum RT-PCR showed a similar effectiveness as the BAL fluid RT-PCR. pneumonia patients in an outpatient setting were not included. a prospective multicenter study of HCAP and CAP is needed to confirm out findings."}
