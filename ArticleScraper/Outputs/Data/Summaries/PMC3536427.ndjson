{"summary": "eukaryotic cells are cytoplasmic foci composed of stalled translation preinitiation complexes. they are postulated to play a critical role in regulating mRNA metabolism during stress via so-called \u201cmRNA triage\u201d (2). eIF2 reduces the amount of eIF2-GTP-tRNA complex and inhibits translation initiation. domain-binding protein (G3BP) is self-oligomerized with the stalled initiation factors. SG assembly begins with the simultaneous formation of numerous small mRNP granules. aggregation of TIA-1 or TIAR is regulated by molecular chaperones. stress-induced translational arrest plays an important role in host antiviral defense. vaccinia virus induces cytoplasmic \u201cfactories\u201d in which viral translation, replication, and assembly take place. these factories include G3BP and Caprin-1 to promote transcription of viral mRNA (11). the genus Flavivirus belongs to the family Flaviviridae. a mutant JEV carrying a core protein incapable of binding to Caprin-1 exhibited lower propagation in vitro and lower pathogenicity in mice. these results reveal a novel strategy of JEV to inhibit SG formation through an interaction with Caprin-1 and facilitate viral propagation. cDNA of human Caprin-1 was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR. cloned into pCAGPM-N-HA (20) and pGEX 6P-1 (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) cDNAs of human G3BP1 and USP10 were also amplified by RT-PCR. all plasmids were confirmed by sequencing with an ABI Prism 3130 genetic analyzer. mammalian cell lines, Vero (African green monkey kidney), 293T (human kidney), Huh7 (human hepatocellular carcinoma) and HeLa (human cervical carcinoma) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimal essential medium (DMEM) anti-JEV core rabbit polyclonal antibody (PAb) and anti-JEV NS3 mouse monoclonal antibody (MAb) were prepared as described previously (20, 23) anti-DENV core protein rabbit PAb was prepared by using a GST-fused protein containing amino acid residues 2 to 100 of the DENV core protein. anti-FLAG mouse MAb (M2) and rabbit PAb and anti-actin mouse MAb were purchased from Sigma.

GST-fused Caprin-1 was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells transformed with pGEX-. the supernatant was mixed with 200 l of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. the beads were washed five times with bacteria lysis buffer. mice were inoculated with 5 104 FFU (100 l) of the viruses. cDNA of core protein of pCAGPM-FLAG-Core was amplified from pCAG/FLAG-DEN2C-HA plasmid by PCR and cloned into pCAGPM-N-HA. cDNA of human Caprin-1 was amplified from 293T cells by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and cloned into pCAGPM-HA-Caprin-1 and pGEX- nucleotide residues of the adenine at 384, adenine at 385, cytosine at 387, and guanine at 388 of the JEV genome in pMWATG1 were replaced with guanine, cytosine, guanine, and cytosine. the cDNA of the mutant core protein was also cloned into pCAGPM-N-FLAG and pET21b. edes albopictus was grown in leibovitz's L-15 medium with 10% FBS. cells were transduced with a lentiviral vector expressing Caprin-1-AcGFP and AcGFP. cells were treated with sodium arsenite at a final concentration of 1.0 mM. anti-hnRNP Q mouse MAb (ab10687), anti-USP10 rabbit PAb (ab70895), and anti-eIF4B rabbit PAb (ab78916) were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, United Kingdom) anti-eIF2, anti-phospho-eIF2 and anti-eIF3A rabbit PAbs were purchased from cell signaling technology (Danvers, MA) nuclei were stained with 4\u2032,6\u2032-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) the samples were examined by a fluoview FV1000 laser scanning confocal microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) transfection, immunoprecipitation, and immunoblotting. EP-Tactin Sepharose (IBA, Gottingen, Germany) equilibrated with cell lysis buffer for 2 h at 4\u00b0C. the proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by Coomassie brilliant blue (CBB) staining using CBB Stain One. each fraction was trypsinized and subjected to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis to identify coi supernatant containing core-His was subjected to ammonium sulfate fractionation. eluted core-His recombinant protein was dialyzed with 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer containing 150 mM NaCl at 4\u00b0C overnight. mice were inoculated with 5 104 FFU (100 l) of the viruses. mice were euthanized and the cerebrums were collected. RESULTS JEV infection confers resistance to SG induction. expression level of TIA-1 in cells infected with JEV was comparable to that in mock-infected cells. accumulation of TIA-1 in the perinuclear region was not observed. a few TIA-1-positive foci were observed in the JEV-infected cells. Huh7 cells infected with JEV at an MOI of 0.5 were treated with or without 1.0 mM sodium arsenite for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. levels of expression of G3BP and JEV core protein/NS2B were determined at 24 h postinfection. cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue) anti-NS2B PAb, goat anti-TIA-1 PAb, AF594-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, and AF633-conjugated anti-goat IgG. cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue) and stained with DAPI (gray) each SG-associated factor forms SGs under oxidative stress. cells were treated with 1.0 mM sodium arsenite for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. infection with WNV or DENV confers resistance to SG formation. mechanisms of the viral circumvention of SG formation in cells infected with JEV are different from those in cells infected with WNV and DENV.

Subcellular localizations of the SG-associated proteins during DENV infection. a plasmid, pCAGPM-HA-Core, was treated with or without 1.0 mM sodium arsenite for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). pCAGPM-HA-Core was treated with 1.0 mM sodium arsenite for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. the inhibition of SG formation takes place downstream of eIF2 phosphorylation. we focused on Caprin-1 as a key factor involved in the inhibition of SG formation in cells infected with JEV. PKR and Caprin-1 are indicated in red. lysates harvested at 24 h posttransfection were treated with or without micrococcal nuclease for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. the precipitates were subjected to immunoblotting (IB) to detect coprecipitated counterparts. the precipitates were coexpressed with HA-Caprin-1 in 293T cells. prin-1 fused with AcGFP (Caprin-1-AcGFP), Caprin-1, actin, or AcGFP in lentivirally transduced Huh7 cells was determined by immunoblotting using appropriate antibodies. subcellular localization of Caprin-1-AcGFP or AcGFP (green) and endogenous Caprin-1 (red) in cells treated with/without 1.0 mM sodium arsenite for 30 min at 37\u00b0C was determined by immunofluor knockdown of Caprin-1 increased number of granules colocalized with SG-associated factors, including TIA-1 and eIF4B. knockdown of Caprin-1 cancels SG inhibition during JEV infection and suppresses viral propagation. infection by immunofluorescence analysis with mouse anti-G3BP MAb and rabbit anti-NS2B PAb, rabbit anti-eIF4B PAb, or goat anti-TIA-1 PAb followed by AF633-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and AF594-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG. lines, boxes, and error bars indicate the means, 25th to 75th percentiles, and 95th percentiles. double replacing both Lys97 and Arg98 with Ala (9798A) completely abrogated the interaction with Caprin-1. the importance of these two amino acids in the interaction with Caprin-1 was confirmed by GST pulldown assay. FLAG-Core mutants in which the hydrophobic amino acid residues in the 1 helix (M1) or 4 helix (M4) were replaced with alanine were coexpressed with HA-Caprin-1 in 293T cells. the precipitates obtained by GST pulldown assay were subject to immunoblotting with anti-His antibody. anti-HA and anti-actin antibodies were also subjected to immunoblotting. cell lysates were also subjected to immunoblotting with anti-Caprin-1 and anti-actin antibodies to evaluate the knockdown efficiency of Caprin-1. the infectious titers in C6/36 and Vero cells infected with the 9798A mutant were 6.1- and 12.6-fold lower than those infected with wild-type JEV at 48 h postinfection respectively. the numbers of foci in cells infected with the 9798A mutant were higher than those infected with the wild-type JEV. -1-AcGFP cells were infected with either WT or 9798A at an MOI of 1.0. cellular localizations of Caprin-1-AcGFP, G3BP (blue) and JEV NS2B (red) were determined at 24 h postinfection by immunofluorescence analysis with mouse anti-core PAb and rabbit anti-NS2B PAb. infectious titers in the cerebrums of mice at 7 days postintraperitoneal inoculation with 5 104 FFU/100 l of either WT or 9798A virus were determined in Vero cells. the detection limit is 102 FFU/g of cerebrum. a few TIA-1-positive foci were observed in the perinuclear region. the accumulation of G3BP and the aggregation of TIA-1, indicating SG formation, appeared at 24 h postinfection. we further examined the dynamics of other SG-associated factors in cells infected with JEV. cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue) cellular localizations of G3BP and JEV NS2B in 293T and HeLa cells infected with JEV were determined at 24 h postinfection by immunofluorescence analysis. AF488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, AF594-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, and AF633-conjugated anti-goat IgG Huh7 cells infected with JEV were immunostained at 0, 12, and 24 h postinfection (hpi) with mouse anti-G3BP MAb or goat anti-TIA-1 PAb and rabbit anti-NS2B PAb. AF488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG followed by AF594-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG. infection with WNV or DENV confers resistance to SG formation induced by sodium arsenite (15) cells were treated with 0.5 mM sodium arsenite for 30 min at 24 h postinfection. accumulation of G3BP in the perinuclear region was observed. dsRNA and viral components (red, AF-594-conjugate secondary antibody) in Huh7 cells infected with DENV were determined by immunofluorescence analysis using the appropriate antibodies at 48 h postinfection. the expression of the core protein alone induced the accumulation of G3BP in the perinuclear region. AF488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and AF594-conjugated anti-rat IgG. cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). JEV core protein directly interacts with Caprin-1, an SG-associated cellular factor. FLAG-JEV core protein and HA-Caprin-1 were coexpressed and immunoprecipitated with anti-HA or anti-FLAG antibody in the presence or absence of nuclease. the interaction between JEV core protein and Caprin-1 was not coprecipitated with HA-Caprin-1. FLAG-DENV core protein was coexpressed with HA-Caprin-1 in 293T cells. his-tagged JEV core protein was incubated with either GST-fused Caprin-1 or GST for 2 h at 4\u00b0C. precipitates obtained by GST pulldown assay were subject to CBB staining and immunoblotting. with/without 1.0 mM sodium arsenite for 30 min at 37\u00b0C was determined by immunofluorescence assay with rabbit anti-Caprin-1 PAb and AF594-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG. cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue) and cellular localizations of JEV and DENV core (red) were determined at 24 h and 48 h postinfection. knockdown of Caprin-1 cancels SG inhibition during JEV infection. levels of expression of Caprin-1 in cells transfected with either siCaprin-1 or siNC were determined by immunoblotting using anti-Caprin-1 and anti-actin antibodies. at 48 h posttransfection, the infectious titers in the supernatants were determined by focus-forming assay in vero cells. numbers of G3BP-positive foci in 30 cells prepared as described in panel B were counted. lines, boxes, and error bars indicate the means, 25th to 75th percentiles, and 95th percentiles. significance of differences between the means was determined by a Student's t test. interactions of the core protein with SG components were examined by immunoprecipitation assay. the wild-type but not mutant 9798A core protein was associated with G3BP1 and USP10. the knockdown of Caprin-1 weakened the interactions of core protein with G3BP1 or USP10. FLAG-Core mutants in which the Met78, Lys79, Lys85, Arg86, Ile92, and Asp93 (7893A) or Lys97 and Arg98 (9798A) in the 4 helix domain were replaced with alanine were coexpressed with HA-Caprin-1 in 293T cells. the precipitates obtained by GST pulldown assay were subjected to immunoblotting. interaction of the JEV core protein with Caprin-1 plays crucial roles in viral propagation in vitro. 9798A mutant core protein was localized in the nucleus and the perinuclear region. however, the 9798A mutant core protein was not colocalized with Caprin-1. mmalian cells infected with the 9798A mutant induced SGs containing both G3BP and Caprin-1. the numbers of foci in cells infected with the wild-type JEV were higher than those infected with the wild-type JEV. titers in the culture supernatants harvested at the indicated times were determined by focus-forming assays in vero cells. titers in the culture supernatants harvested at the indicated times were determined by focus-forming assays. vaccinia virus subverts SG components to generate aggregates containing G3BP, Caprin-1, eIF4G, eIF4E, and mRNA of the virus. TIA-1 and TIAR bind to the 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of the negative-stranded RNA of WNV. a mutant JEV carrying a core protein incapable of binding to Caprin-1 exhibited reduced replication in vitro and attenuated pathogenicity in mice. a mutant JEV carrying a core protein incapable of binding to Caprin-1 exhibited reduced replication in vitro and attenuated pathogenicity. in cells infected with hepatitis C virus, several SG components were colocalized with the core protein in the perinuclear region. in those infected with WNV or DENV, SG components were accumulated in a replication complex composed of viral RNA and nonstructural proteins. phosphorylation of eIF2 induced by arsenite was completely canceled by the infection with WNV or DENV, whereas suppression of the phosphorylation was limited in it was shown that activation of PKR was suppressed (40) or only induced in the late stage of WNV infection (41) and impaired by the expression of HCV NS5A (42\u201344) flavivirus core protein interacts with Caprin-1 and inhibits SG formation downstream of the phosphorylation of eIF2 in the late stage of infection."}
