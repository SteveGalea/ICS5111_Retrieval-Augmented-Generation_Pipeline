{"summary": "the international health regulations of 2005 advocate enhanced surveillance of events that may constitute a \u201cpublic health emergency of international concern\u201d. the threats of novel agents of respiratory infection (particularly SRAS in 2003, and a new coronavirus in 2012) and the emergence of influenza A(H1N1)pdm2009 virus have also focused attention on influenza surveillance capabilities worldwide. the 4S network uses health service-based indicators and mostly focuses on fever syndromes and diarrhea. a steering committee was set up by the Ministry of Health (MoH), the Pasteur Institute in dakar (IPD) and the WHO local office. sentinel surveillance system in Senegal was based on clinical pre-diagnostic data. fever (the inclusion criterion was an axillary temperature of more than 37.5\u00b0C) was the first symptom targeted. three diseases associated with fever were selected. data analysis Data were available for analysis shortly after the patient's initial visit. a medical epidemiologist reviewed the output from all 11 primary health centers on a daily basis. separate analyses were carried out for each syndrome category of interest. sentinel surveillance system was able to document peaks in the incidence of febrile syndromes. if baseline levels were not available, the identification of aberrations was empirical. each increase was reported immediately by phone to regional health officials and public health officials at the MoH. sentinel fever network has been expanded from three ILI sentinel sites in 2011 to 11 sentinel sites in 2013. each participating SGP reported the number of cases that met the criteria, including the total number of patient visits on each reporting day. sentinel surveillance system in Senegal was based on clinical pre-diagnostic data. fever (the inclusion criterion was an axillary temperature of more than 37.5\u00b0C) was the first symptom targeted. three diseases associated with fever were selected for surveillance. data analysis Data were available for analysis shortly after the patient's initial visit. a medical epidemiologist reviewed the output from all 11 primary health centers on a daily basis, and noted any changes in community-wide incidences of fever. fluctuations in values at a sentinel center can be monitored on a daily basis. increases are reported immediately by telephone to the moH. the first step in any outbreak investigation is to confirm the signals. the national ethics committee has previously approved the work of the national Influenza Center. the patients included in this study were of all ages and consulted the sentinel sites due to influenza-like symptoms. the patients, or parents in case of minors, accept the tests for respiratory viruses largely because they are free and safe. 1,101 (5.7) 616 (9.9) DAKAR SUD 30 May 2012 46,089 (45.3) 10,880 (23.6) 5,249 (48.2) 1,217 (23.2) 21 (0.2) 2,554 (23.5) 2,001 (4.3) 187 (1.7) FATICK 15 May 2013 1,064 (1.0) 157 (14.8) 34 (21.7) 6 (17.6) 3 (1.9) 54 (34.4) 57 (5.4) 12 (7.6) KAOLACK 2 July 203 (29.3) 20 (9.9) 71 (10.2) 443 (63.8) 192 (3.5) 63 (9.1) TOTAL 101,640 (100.0) 22,662 (22.3) 9,019 (39.8) 1,630 (18.1) 770 (3.4) 5,157 (22.8) 5,577 (5.5) 1,372 (6.1) * number of visits by sentinel site reported to the number of all the visits.
