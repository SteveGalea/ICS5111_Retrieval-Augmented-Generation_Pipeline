{"summary": "intraluminal pH, which becomes increasingly acidic as proteins move from the Golgi (pH 6.7) into mature secretory granules (pH 5.2), is a key factor governing interactions among soluble cargo and granule membrane proteins and lipids. more than half of the peptide products require an essential -amidation reaction at their C terminus to make them biologically active. the major splice variant, PAM-1, is subject to cleavage by prohormone convertases, generating soluble PHM (sPAM) and membrane PAL. after granule exocytosis, PAM-1 that is deposited on the cell surface is either recycled or degraded (14\u201316) the luminal domain of PAM is again exposed to environments of descending pH. the imidazole side chain of His, with a pKa of 6.0, is an ideal candidate to exhibit dual conformational states upon protonation/deprotonation events. a conformational change in the vesicular-stomatitis virus due to His protonation brings about membrane fusion (26, 27) the linker region in PAM-2 includes only 36 amino acids. the linker region in PAM-1 includes an additional 105-amino acid segment encoded by exon 16. this region plays an important role in the sorting, trafficking, and turnover of PAM (16) \u00b0C with HRV3C protease (80 units/500 ml of culture) washed with 20 mm NaTES (pH 7.0) to retrieve the recombinant protein. further purification was accomplished by binding the eluate to a Q-Sepharose column equilibrated with 20 mm NaTES (pH 7.0) followed by elution with a gradient to 0.5 m NaCl in the same buffer over 60 min a 50-l sample of 0.2\u20130.5 mg/ml of recombinant protein in 5 mm HEPES, 10 mm MES (pH 7.5) was titrated to pH 5.5 by adding a pre-determined amount of 0.125 n HCl. the supernatants were removed and the entire solubilized pellets were subject to SDS-PAGE. k were transfected with 30 g of pCI-Neo-Kr PAM-1/H3A vector using Lipofectamine. drug-resistant lines were selected based on their ability to secrete active PHM. two stable clonal cell lines were chosen for further analysis. intracellular pH gradients were collapsed by treating PAM-1 and PAM-1/H3A atT-20 cells with alkalinizing drugs in complete serum-free medium for 24 h. concanamycin A (Sigma) in dimethyl sulfoxide was used at 1 nm to block the vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) cells were incubated with antibody JH629 1:250 in DMEM/HEPES/BSA for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C, rinsed with DMEM/HEPES/BSA at 4 \u00b0C, then chased in culture medium at 37 \u00b0C. cells were fixed with 2.5% glutaraladehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide and 1.5% potassium ferrocyanide sections were systematically scanned to give 73 multivesicular bodies. gold particles within 20 nm of the membrane of the multivesicular body were classified as external. gold particles within 20 nm of the membrane of the multivesicular body were classified as external. cell lines expressing PAM-1 or PAM-1/H3A were incubated for 30 min in CSFM/air. minus medium was replaced with Met minus medium containing [35S]Met (1 mCi/ml;

PAM activity was quantified using [125I]-Acetyl-Tyr-Val-Gly. samples were assayed in duplicate after addition of optimal amounts of exogenous copper and ascorbate. intracellular pH gradients collapsed by treating PAM-1 and PAM-1/H3A atT-20 cells with alkalinizing drugs. antibodies were visualized using Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (code 715-166-151; Jackson ImmunoResearch) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (code 711-096-152, Jackson ImmunoResearch) cells were fixed with 2.5% glutaraladehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, post-fixed with 1% osmium tetro incubated in DMEM/HEPES with protein A/15 nm colloidal gold (University of Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands) for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C, rinsed in DMEM/HEPES at 4 \u00b0C, then chased in culture medium at 37 \u00b0C. sections were systematically scanned to give 73 multivesicular bodies from two experiments in each cell line. cell lines plated into 4-well dishes were allowed to reach 70\u201380% confluence. cells were incubated in medium lacking Met for 5 min. cells were extracted into TMT for analysis of PAM and into 5 n acetic acid. surface biotinylation was carried out for 10 min at 37 \u00b0C. the reaction was quenched by replacing the buffer with CSFM/air with 2 mg/ml of BSA for 5 min. cells were either extracted immediately or chased for up to 4 h. catalytic core of PHM (PHMcc) is followed by a well conserved cluster of three His residues (Fig. 1, A and B) this His cluster is included in the final exon (rat exon 13; exon 14 is included only in a rare splice variant) encoding PHMcc and is followed by a poorly conserved, protease-sensitive region encoded by a short exon present in each of the major splice variants of P the plot of []200 nm versus pH revealed a half-maximal effect at approximately pH 6.5, consistent with a role for His protonation in the response. the far UV CD spectrum of the H3A linker was not altered when the pH was dropped from pH 7.0 to pH 5.0. inset shows the wavelength of maximum relative fluorescence intensity value (max) as a function of pH. aggregation of recombinant WT and H3A linker was assessed at pH 7.5 or 5.5 in triplicate. supernatant (an aliquot representing 20% of the sample used) and pellet fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. PAM-1/H3A and PAM-1 were expressed in HEK293 cells. both proteins were expressed at similar levels in the HEK293 clones selected. only a protein the size of full-length PAM-1 (120 kDa) was detected. the HEK293 line expressing PAM-1 was generated previously (44). a single protein of the same mass (120 kDa) was identified in both samples. the pH optimum for PHM in lysates of PAM-1 and PAM-1/H3A cells was assessed. atT-20 cells expressing PAM-1 or PAM-1/H3A were incubated for 1 h in basal medium. cell extracts (CE) and spent media (Med) were subjected to Western blot analysis using an antibody to PHM. sPHM is produced only in the regulated secretory pathway. atT-20 cells expressing PAM-1 lacked extensive cellular processes filled with ACTH-containing secretory granules. proteolytic processing of PAM-1 and PAM-1/H3A was first compared by analyzing cell lysates using antisera to the PHM, exon 16 and cytosolic domains of PAM. sPHM accounted for a smaller percentage of the total PAM protein in PAM-1/H3A cells than in P intact PAM-1 was the only PAM protein detected in both cell lines. sPHM was created only in the regulated secretory pathway. newly synthesized sPHM was first detected after a 1-h chase. newly synthesized sPHM disappeared more quickly than newly synthesized PAM-1. at the end of the 4-h chase, over 40% of the newly synthesized PAM-1 remained intact. only about 50% of the newly synthesized PAM-1/H3A was recovered as sPHM/H3A. bifunctional sPAM was first detected in the medium of PAM-1 cells after the 2-h chase. 5\u20136% of the newly synthesized PAM-1 was recovered from the medium as sPAM after the 4-h chase. 2% of the newly synthesized PAM-1/H3A was recovered as sPAM/H3A. western blot analysis revealed similar amounts of intact PAM-1 and membrane PAL on the surface of PAM-1 and PAM-1/H3A cells at steady state. a, cells chilled to 4 \u00b0C were exposed to cell-impermeant activated biotin for 10 min. the reaction was quenched and biotinylated proteins isolated from cell lysates were fractionated and probed for PAM using affinity purified exon 16 antibody. biotinylated PAM-1 was converted into sPAM and sPHM. no production of biotinylated sPAM/H3A or biotinylated sPHM/H3A was detectable. NH4Cl/methylamine treatment had no discernible effect on the morphology of PAM-1 or PAM-1/H3A AtT-20 cells. increased amounts of sPAM in lysates prepared from concanamycin A-treated PAM-1 AtT-20 cells. this response was not seen in PAM-1/H3A cells and was not seen in either cell line in response to NH4Cl/methylamine treatment. different responses observed in PAM-1 and PAM-1/H3A reflect the change in luminal pH and the role of the V-ATPase in additional events. PAM was visualized using an antibody specific to PHM (*, nonspecific band) processing was evaluated by plotting the sPAM/PAM-1 (B) and sPHM/PAM-1 (C) ratios from duplicate samples from two independent experiments. sf-CD was detected in MG-132-treated PAM-1 cells. the presence of MG132 had a more pronounced effect on levels of intermediate 2 and sf-CD. the decreased levels of intermediate 2, the substrate for -secretase, in PAM-1/H3A cells could contribute to decreased production of sf-CD. the proportion of gold particles at the outer membrane versus intraluminal vesicles of multivesicular bodies was not cell-type specific. clathrin-mediated internalization of PAMantibody complexes followed by the entry of PAM-1antibody complexes into intraluminal vesicles of multivesicular bodies. trafficking of the PAMantibody complexes that reached the multivesicular bodies into intraluminal vesicles was not altered in PAM-1/H3A cells. morphology of early endosomes containing PAMantibody complexes not altered in PAM-1/H3A cells. non-transfected AtT-20 cells tend to grow in groups of 10\u201315 polygonal cells (32) atT-20 cells expressing PAM-1/H3A at similar levels had the spindle-shaped morphology of non-transfected AtT-20 cells. att-20 cells expressing PAM-1/H3A at similar levels had the spindle-shaped morphology of non-transfected AtT-20 cells. transmission EM shows condensation of protein in the cisternae of the TGN in a trans-most cisterna of the TGN in a PAM-1 cell. PAM staining in the tubulovesicular structures of the TGN was similar in WT PAM-1 and PAM-1/H3A cells (middle) non-transfected AtT-20 cells where mature ACTH accumulated in the tips of the processes. steady state distribution of ACTH was compared with that of a cis-Golgi marker (GM130) in non-transfected cells. extensive cleavage of newly synthesized POMC occurred in all three cell lines during the first hour of chase. extensive cleavage of newly synthesized POMC occurred in all three cells during the first hour of chase. -1 and PAM-1/H3A AtT-20 cells were incubated with control medium (Basal) or challenged with medium containing 2 mm BaCl2 for 30 min. lysates and aliquots of medium were subjected to Western blot analysis using an antibody specific for the MSH region of POMC. the steady state signal for the 16-kDa fragment in WT PAM-1 cells was significantly lower than in both non-transfected and PAM-1/H3A cells. this decreased accumulation of 16-kDa fragment in the medium after a 30-min barium stimulation. the effects of this change were first evaluated in the context of the linker region alone. purified GST fusion proteins encoding the wild-type linker (WT linker) and the mutated linker (H3A linker) were cleaved and ion exchange chromatography was used to purify both proteins. the effect of pH on the far UV CD spectrum of each protein was determined. er was much less sensitive to changes in pH over this range. his cluster in WT linker is responsible for its pH-dependent properties. inset shows pH-dependent changes monitored by changes in ellipticity at = 200 nm for the WT and H3A linker proteins. purified PAM-3 showed a strong homophilic aggregation (35%, at pH 5.8) when mixed with globin and more extensive aggregation when mixed with adrenal chromaffin granule proteins. a pH 7.5 stock solution of each purified protein was left untouched or titrated to pH 5.5. a stably transfected HEK293 cell line expressing PAM-1/H3A was generated previously. the pH optimum for PHM in lysates of HEK293 cells was assessed by measuring activity from pH 3.0 to 8.0. T-20 lines expressing PAM-1 or PAM-1/H3A were fixed and stained simultaneously for PAM (6E6, specific for the C terminus of PAM) and ACTH (JH44, specific for the C terminus of ACTH) cell morphology differed substantially, but PAM was localized to the TGN area in both lines. atT-20 cells expressing PAM-1 lacked extensive cellular processes filled with ACTH-containing secretory granules. sPHM and membrane PAL accounted for a smaller percentage of the total PAM protein in PAM-1/H3A cells than in PAM-1 cells. sPHM, which is produced only in the regulated secretory pathway, and sPAM, which is produced only in the endocytic pathway, were the major PHM proteins identified in spent media from both cell lines. increased secretion of sPHM by PAM-1/H3A cells would contribute to their decreased cell content of sPHM. sPHM and sPAM were the major proteolytic cleavage products. total recovery was calculated by taking 120-kDa PAM present after the pulse as 100%. newly synthesized PAM-1/H3A disappeared more quickly than newly synthesized PAM-1. newly synthesized sPHM generated from PAM-1/H3A was secreted at a much higher rate than newly synthesized sPHM generated from PAM-1. sPHM was secreted at a much higher rate than newly synthesized sPHM generated from PAM-1 cells after the 2-h chase. less than 2% of the total PAM-1 is on the surface at steady state. surface biotinylation analyses revealed similar amounts of intact PAM-1 and membrane PAL on the surface of PAM-1 and PAM-1/H3A cells at steady state. cells were quenched and harvested immediately or chased in growth medium for the indicated amount of time. biotinylated proteins were isolated from cell extracts and spent media, fractionated, and probed for PAM. nched and cells were harvested or chased in growth medium for the indicated amount of time. NH4Cl/methylamine treatment had no discernible effect on the morphology of PAM-1 or PAM-1/H3A AtT-20 cells. lysates and spent media prepared from control were examined using an antibody specific for the PHM domain of PAM. spm/PAM ratio in PAM-1 cells was reduced by NH4Cl/methylamine and by concanamycin. PAM-1/H3A cells reflect both the change in luminal pH and the role of the V-ATPase in additional events such as membrane fission and fusion. the processing and trafficking of PAM-1/H3A is less sensitive to dissipation of intracellular pH gradients than PAM-1. sf-CD production is facilitated by preincubation with MG132, a proteosomal inhibitor. sf-CD was detected in both lysates in the absence or presence of MG-132. decreased levels of intermediate 2 and sf-CD in PAM-1/H3A cells could contribute to decreased production of sf-CD. cell lysates were analyzed using an antibody specific for the C terminus of PAM. two treated samples for each cell type are compared with controls. internalization of PAMantibody complexes decreased dramatically in PAM-1/H3A cells. trafficking of the PAMantibody complexes that reached the multivesicular bodies into intraluminal vesicles was not altered in PAM-1/H3A cells. expression of PAM-1/H3A does not alter secretory pathway function in AtT-20 cells. morphology of AtT-20 cells stably expressing PAM-1/H3A resembled non-transfected AtT-20 cells more than PAM-1 AtT-20 cells. morphology of mature secretory granules seen near the plasma membrane was indistinguishable in AtT-20 cells expressing PAM-1 and PAM-1/H3A. a phase image of non-transfected (NT), WT PAM-1, and PAM-1/H3A expressing AtT-20 cells shows altered cell morphology. the morphology of mature secretory granules was indistinguishable in both lines. mature ACTH accumulated in puncta located at the tips of the spindle-shaped non-transfected AtT-20 cells. in AtT-20 cells expressing PAM-1, ACTH accumulated in punctate structures located at the tips of cellular processes, with little ACTH signal in the Golgi region. POMC processing and secretion are not inhibited in AtT-20 cells expressing PAM-1/H3A Pulse-chase metabolic labeling followed by immunoprecipitation with an antibody that recognizes the N-terminal region of ACTH. cleavage of newly synthesized POMC at pairs of basic residues generates ACTH biosynthetic intermediate followed by ACTH. non-transfected and PAM-1/H3A AtT-20 cells were incubated with [35S]Met for 30 min. cells and media were harvested immediately (Pulse) or after a 1-, 2-, or 4-h chase. ACTH-containing peptides were immunoprecipitated using an antibody specific for the N-terminal region of ACTH (JH93) a pH-dependent conformational change in the luminal domain of PAM alters the ability of its unstructured, multiply phosphorylated C-terminal region to interact with cytosolic proteins. a striking effect of PAM-1 expression in AtT-20 cells is its ability to diminish secretagogue-stimulated release of POMC products. this His cluster is included in the final exon (rat exon 13; exon 14 is included only in a rare splice variant) encoding PHMcc. the non-catalytic linker region between PHM and PAL can end at exon 15, as in PAM-2, or can include a 315-nt exon (rat exon 16), as in PAM-1 (Fig. 1, A and B) (42). the plot of []200 nm versus pH revealed a half-maximal effect at approximately pH 6.5. the far UV CD spectrum of the H3A linker was not altered when the pH was dropped from pH 7.0 to pH 5.0. aggregation of recombinant WT and H3A linker was assessed at pH 7.5 or 5.5 in triplicate. supernatant (an aliquot representing 20% of the sample used) and pellet fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. D, the amount of linker protein in each fraction, at pH 7.5 and 5.5, was quantified by densitometric scanning. PAM-1/H3A and PAM-1 were expressed in HEK293 cells. both proteins were expressed at similar levels in the HEK293 clones selected. HEK293 cells lack the regulated secretory pathway endoproteases that cleave PAM. analysis of total cell lysates using an affinity purified antibody specific for PHM (JH 1761) identified a single protein of the same mass (120 kDa) in both samples. the pH optimum for PHM in lysates of PAM-1 and PAM-1/H3A HEK293 cells was assessed by measuring activity from pH 3.0 to 8.0. atT-20 cells expressing PAM-1 or PAM-1/H3A were incubated for 1 h in basal medium. cell extracts (CE) and spent media were subjected to Western blot analysis using an antibody to PHM. the basal secretion rate of sPHM was calculated from these Western blots. proteolytic processing of PAM-1 and PAM-1/H3A in AtT-20 cells was first compared by analyzing cell lysates using antisera to the PHM, exon 16 and cytosolic domains of PAM. sPHM accounted for a smaller percentage of the total PAM protein in PAM-1/H3A cells than in PAM-1 cells. intact sPHM was the only PAM protein detected in both cell lines. sPHM was created only in the regulated secretory pathway. sPHM was first detected after a 1-h chase in both cells. secretion of newly synthesized sPHM was calculated by dividing sPAMmdm by PAM-1cell after the pulse. newly synthesized PAM-1/H3A disappeared more quickly than newly synthesized PAM-1. bifunctional sPAM was first detected in the medium of PAM-1 cells after the 2-h chase. 5\u20136% of the newly synthesized PAM-1 was recovered from the medium as sPAM after the 4-h chase. 2% of the newly synthesized PAM-1/H3A was recovered as sPAM/H3A. internalized PAM-1/H3A cells chilled to 4 \u00b0C were exposed to cell-impermeant activated biotin for 10 min. the reaction was quenched and biotinylated proteins isolated from cell lysates were fractionated. the total lanes represent 0.5% of the amount analyzed after biotinylation. biotinylated PAM-1 was converted into sPAM and sPHM. no production of biotinylated sPAM/H3A or biotinylated sPHM/H3A was detectable. NH4Cl/methylamine treatment had no discernible effect on morphology of PAM-1 or PAM-1/H3A atT-20 cells. sPAM in lysates prepared from concanamycin A-treated PAM-1 AtT-20 cells was reduced by NH4Cl/methylamine and by concanamycin. this ratio was lower in PAM-1/H3A cells and was not altered by either treatment. the different responses observed in PAM-1 and PAM-1/H3A reflect both the change in luminal pH and the role of the V-ATPase in additional events such as membrane fission and fusion processing was evaluated by plotting the sPAM/PAM-1 (B) and sPHM/PAM-1 (C) ratios from duplicate samples from two independent experiments. data are expressed as % sPHM secreted/h. the presence of MG132 had a more pronounced effect on levels of intermediate 2 and sf-CD, products thought to be generated in the regulated secretory pathway. the decreased levels of intermediate 2 and sf-CD in PAM-1/H3A cells could contribute to decreased production of sf-CD. the proportion of gold particles at the outer membrane versus intraluminal vesicles of multivesicular bodies was not cell-type specific. clathrin-mediated internalization of PAMantibody complexes followed by the entry of PAM-1antibody complexes into the intraluminal vesicles of multivesicular bodies. trafficking of the PAMantibody complexes that reached the multivesicular bodies into intraluminal vesicles was not altered in PAM-1/H3A cells. morphology of the early endosomes containing PAMantibody complexes was not altered in PAM-1/H3A cells. the chase time was reduced to 10 min. AM-1 AtT-20 cells tend to grow in groups of 10\u201315 polygonal cells. atT-20 cells expressing PAM-1/H3A at similar levels had the spindle-shaped morphology of non-transfected AtT-20 cells. transmission EM studies previously revealed an accumulation of secretory protein in the TGN area. PAM staining in the tubulovesicular structures of the TGN was similar in both lines. line scans revealed some ACTH in the Golgi region of AtT-20 cells expressing PAM-1 and PAM-1/H3A. ACTH localization was compared with that of a cis-Golgi marker (GM130) in non-transfected (NT), WT PAM-1 and PAM-1/H3A AtT-20 cells. in PAM-1/H3A AtT-20 cells, ACTH accumulated at the tips of cellular processes (arrows) extensive cleavage of newly synthesized POMC occurred in all three cell lines during the first hour of chase. extensive cleavage of newly synthesized POMC occurred in all three cell lines during the first hour of chase, with the appearance of ACTH biosynthetic intermediate. lysates and aliquots of medium were subjected to Western blot analysis using an antibody specific for the MSH region of POMC. BaCl2 stimulated the secretion of the 16-kDa fragment secretion by non-transfected and PAM-1/H3A AtT-20 cells. the steady state signal for the 16-kDa fragment in WT PAM-1 cells was significantly lower than in both non-transfected and PAM-1/H3A cells. this reduced accumulation of 16-kDa fragment in the medium after a 30-min barium stimulation (Fig. 10C) the protease-resistant catalytic core of PHM is followed by a well conserved cluster of three His residues. GST fusion proteins encoding the wild-type linker (WT linker) and the mutated linker (H3A linker) were cleaved and ion exchange chromatography was used to purify both proteins. at physiological pH, the CD spectrum, with a negative maximum () at 200 nm, revealed the unstructured nature of this region. a concentrated stock of purified recombinant protein was diluted to 6 m with 20 mm buffers varying in pH and incubated for 2 h before recording far UV-CD spectra. inset shows pH-dependent changes monitored by changes in ellipticity at = 200 nm for the WT and H3A linker proteins. a pH 7.5 stock solution of each purified protein was left untouched or titrated to pH 5.5. as much as 11% of the WT linker precipitated at pH 5.5. only 6% of the H3A linker precipitated under these conditions. PAM-1/H3A exhibited the same pH optimum, but slightly lower activity from pH 5.5 to 7. when enzyme activity at pH 4.5 was normalized to the amount of PAM protein present in the lysates based on Western blot signal, PAM-1/H3A exhibited slightly lower PHM and PAL specific activity. sPHM levels were lower in PAM-1/H3A cells than in PAM-1 cells. sphM levels were lower in PAM-1/H3A cells than in PAM-1 cells. atT-20 cells expressing PAM-1 lacked extensive cellular processes filled with ACTH-containing secretory granules. sPHM accounted for a smaller percentage of the total PAM protein in PAM-1/H3A cells than in PAM-1 cells. sPHM contains the His cluster, whereas membrane PAL does not. sPHM, which is produced only in the regulated secretory pathway, and sPAM, which is produced only in the endocytic pathway, were the major PHM proteins identified in spent media from both cell lines. increased secretion of sPHM by PAM-1/H3A cells would contribute to their decreased cell content of sPHM. sPHM and sPAM were the major proteolytic cleavage products (indicated by arrows) in both cell types. total recovery was calculated by taking 120-kDa PAM present after the pulse as 100%. sized PAM-1 was converted into smaller products. 82% of the initially labeled PAM-1 had been converted into sPHM. only about 50% of the PAM-1/H3A was recovered as sPHM/H3A. this result suggests that newly synthesized sPHM is subject to degradation. less than 2% of the total PAM-1 is on the surface at steady state (39, 51, 53) surface biotinylation analysis revealed similar amounts of intact PAM-1 and membrane PAL on the surface of PAM-1 and PAM-1/H3A cells at steady state. cells incubated with cell-impermeant biotin for 10 min at 37 \u00b0C were quenched and harvested immediately or chased in growth medium for up to 4 h before extraction. cells incubated with cell-impermeant biotin for 10 min at 37 \u00b0C were quenched and harvested immediately. NH4Cl/methylamine treatment had no discernible effect on the morphology of PAM-1 or PAM-1/H3A AtT-20 cells. lysates and spent media prepared from control and drug-treated cells were examined using an antibody specific for the PHM domain of PAM. the processing and trafficking of PAM-1/H3A is less sensitive to dissipation of intracellular pH gradients than PAM-1. cells were treated with alkalinizing agents or concanamycin A for 24 h. equal amounts of protein (5 g) from control (C), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) vehicle (D), 2.5 mm ammonium chloride and 5 mm methylamine (N) and 1 nm concanamycin A (CA att-20 cells expressing PAM-1 or PAM-1/H3A were harvested under control conditions or after a 4.5-h pre-treatment with MG132. sf-CD was detected in both lysates in the absence or presence of MG-132. levels of intermediate 2 and sf-CD in the absence and presence of MG-132 were quantified. two treated samples for each cell type are compared with controls. B, signals for sf-CD, 19- and 22-kDa intermediates were quantified. internalization of PAMantibody complexes decreased dramatically in PAM-1/H3A cells. trafficking of the PAMantibody complexes that reached the multivesicular bodies into intraluminal vesicles was not altered in PAM-1/H3A cells. expression of PAM-1/H3A does not alter secretory pathway function in AtT-20 cells. morphology of AtT-20 cells stably expressing PAM-1/H3A resembled non-transfected AtT-20 cells more than PAM-1 AtT-20 cells. att20 cells expressing PAM-1/H3A at similar levels had spindle-shaped morphology of non-transfected AtT-20 cells. morphology of mature secretory granules seen near the plasma membrane was indistinguishable in AtT-20 cells expressing PAM-1 and PAM-1/H3A. a phase image of non-transfected (NT), WT PAM-1, and PAM-1/H3A expressing AtT-20 cells shows altered cell morphology. line scans revealed some ACTH in the Golgi region of AtT-20 cells expressing PAM-1. in atT-20 cells expressing PAM-1/H3A, ACTH accumulated in punctate structures located at the tips of cellular processes, with little ACTH signal in the Golgi region. cleavage of newly synthesized POMC at pairs of basic residues generates ACTH biosynthetic intermediate followed by ACTH. cells incubated in medium containing [35S]Met for 30 min were harvested or chased for 1, 2, and 4 h. peptides were immunoprecipitated using an antibody specific for the N-terminal region of ACTH. expression of PAM-1 reduced POMC cleavage and increased secretion of ACTH biosynthetic intermediate (ABI) in non-transfected and PAM-1/H3A AtT-20 cells, POMC was cleaved into ACTH and glycosylated ACTH. a pH-dependent conformational change in the luminal domain of PAM alters the ability of its unstructured, multiply phosphorylated C-terminal region to interact with cytosolic proteins. another striking effect of PAM-1 expression in AtT-20 cells is its ability to diminish secretagogue-stimulated release of POMC products. a single His residue controls the interaction of lysosomal membrane protein type 2 (LIMP-2) with its lysosomal cargo protein, -glucocerebrosidase (60), and a single His residue serves as the pH sensor that regulates furin activation in the secretory pathway. a single His residue serves as the pH sensor that regulates furin activation in the secretory pathway (61). unfolding and refolding studies of bovine serum albumin showed a similar dip in ellipticity at acid pH, reflecting protein compressibility (64). the decreased negative ellipticity and blue-shifted max observed upon protonation of His residues in the WT linker suggest that its structure is more tightly packed at low pH (61). a clear role for the PAM-1 His cluster in responding to luminal pH is supported by the ability of both NH4Cl/methylamine and concanamycin treatment to diminish sPHM levels in PAM-1. the V-ATPase acts as a proton pump and as a pH sensor, relaying luminal pH information to cytosolic interactors. PAM-4, a natural splice variant that encodes a soluble PHM protein that includes the His cluster, is stored more efficiently in regulated secretory granules than PHMcc. the diminished ability of PHM/H3A to enter the regulated secretory pathway is also reflected in its increased basal secretion from PAM-1/H3A cells. a conformational change triggered by the His cluster when internalized PAM-1 reaches an appropriately acidified endosome plays an essential role in its endocytic trafficking. the inability of PAM-1/H3A to traverse the endocytic pathway normally eliminates production of sf-CD. expression of similar levels of PAM-1 does not alter POMC processing, secretagogue responsiveness, or cytoskeletal organization. the inability of low luminal pH to alter the conformation of the cytosolic domain of PAM-1/H3A as it traverses specific subcellular locations could alter its ability to interact with essential cytosolic proteins like Kalirin and Uhmk1 (16. lacking the ability to traverse the endocytic pathway, PAM-1/H3A may never be exposed to the enzymes that allow PAM-1 to undergo the sequential cleavages. histidine Cluster Imparts pH Sensing Capability to PAM Linker. a single His residue controls the interaction of lysosomal membrane protein type 2 (LIMP-2) with its lysosomal cargo protein, -glucocerebrosidase (60), and a single His residue serves as the pH sensor that regulates furin activation in the secretory pathway. recombinant wild-type PAM linker responds to a shift from pH 7 to 5. this response is lost in the H3A linker. unfolding and refolding studies of bovine serum albumin showed a similar dip in ellipticity at acid pH. the decrease in specific activity could reflect an increased level of immature PAM-1/H3A protein due to its limited endocytosis. a clear role for the PAM-1 His cluster in responding to luminal pH is supported by the ability of both NH4Cl/methylamine and concanamycin treatment. newly synthesized PAM-1 and PAM-1/H3A first enter a cleavage competent compartment at the same time. newly synthesized PAM-1/H3A is more likely to undergo degradation. soluble PHM/H3A is more likely to undergo basal secretion. ing and surface biotinylation revealed the almost total absence of sPAM/H3A in PAM-1/H3A cells. lack of access to its normal endocytic trafficking pathway, internalized PAM-1/H3A is rapidly degraded. the trafficking of PAM-1 through multivesicular bodies is regulated by phosphorylation. expression of similar levels of PAM-1/H3A does not alter POMC processing, secretagogue responsiveness, or cytoskeletal organization. differences could be a direct reflection of altered properties of PAM-1/H3A or an indirect effect of the inability of PAM-1/H3A to traffic normally, generate sf-CD, and alter gene expression. a pH-dependent conformational change in the linker domain of PAM-1 may trigger a different cytosolic response than a pH-dependent conformational change. a single His residue controls the interaction of lysosomal membrane protein type 2 (LIMP-2) with its lysosomal cargo protein, -glucocerebrosidase (60) the presence of a conserved cluster of His residues in the linker region of mammalian and Xenopus PAM led us to investigate the possibility that this region could serve as a pH sensor. if the single His residues found in Acropora, Schistosoma, and Chlamydomonas PAM serve a similar function, this role is ancient. ary and adrenal lysates, which interact with other cargo proteins, also aggregate at low pH (1). ary and adrenal lysates acquire more helical structure. additional studies will be required to determine the effect of pH on the structure of the linker region when constrained by its attachment to PHM and PAL. newly synthesized PAM-1 and PAM-1/H3A cells secreted sPHM more quickly than PAM-1 cells. but sPHM secretion by both cell lines was decreased following prolonged exposure to NH4Cl/methylamine or concanamycin. this result indicates that additional regions of PAM-1 contribute to its pH sensitivity. cleavage of PAM-1 at a site close to its transmembrane domain produces sPAM and an 19-kDa C-terminal fragment. both metabolic labeling and surface biotinylation revealed the almost total absence of sPAM/H3A in PAM-1/H3A cells. lacking access to its normal endocytic trafficking pathway, internalized PAM-1/H3A is rapidly degraded. expression of PAM-1 causes changes in gene expression, inhibits POMC processing, reduces the ability of secretagogue to stimulate secretagogue. expression of similar levels of PAM-1/H3A does not alter POMC processing, secretagogue responsiveness, or cytoskeletal organization. expression of similar levels of PAM-1/H3A does not alter POMC processing, secretagogue responsiveness, or cytoskeletal organization. changes in phosphorylation at specific subcellular locations may occur. a pH-dependent conformational change in the linker domain of PAM-1 may trigger a different cytosolic response. a single His residue controls the interaction of lysosomal membrane protein type 2 with its lysosomal cargo protein, -glucocerebrosidase (60) the a2-subunit of mouse V-ATPase are needed to sense endosomal pH and trigger the conformational change that transmits this information to its cytoplasmic domain. the presence of a conserved cluster of His residues in the linker region of mammalian and Xenopus PAM led us to investigate the possibility that this region could serve as a pH sensor. in test tube assays, purified soluble PAM-3 undergoes pH-dependent aggregation (1). PAM in pituitary and adrenal lysates, which interact with other cargo proteins, also aggregates at low pH (1). in the presence of trifluoroethanol, WT linker acquires more helical structure. the interaction of the V-ATPase with Arf6 and ARNO depends on luminal acidification. the increased accumulation of sPAM in concanamycin, but not in NH4Cl/methylamine, treated PAM-1 cells indicates that this response is not solely due to altered luminal pH. cleavage of PAM-1 at a site close to its transmembrane domain produces sPAM and an 19-kDa C-terminal fragment. a conformational change triggered by the His cluster when internalized PAM-1 reaches an appropriately acidified endosome plays an essential role in its endocytic trafficking. ase catalyzed intramembrane proteolysis of the 19- and 22/24-kDa TMD/CD fragments of PAM-1 generates sf-CD. this fragment accumulates in the nucleus in a phosphorylation state-dependent manner and is thought to play a role in controlling gene expression. expression of PAM-1 causes changes in gene expression, inhibits POMC processing, reduces the ability of secretagogue to stimulate secretory gran tic pathway, PAM-1/H3A may never be exposed to enzymes that allow PAM-1 to undergo sequential cleavages needed to produce sf-CD and signal from the lumen to the cytosol. changes in phosphorylation at specific subcellular locations may occur."}
