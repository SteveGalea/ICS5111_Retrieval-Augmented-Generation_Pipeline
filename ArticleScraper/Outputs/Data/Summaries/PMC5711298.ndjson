{"summary": "GRRT is an agencywide asset mandated to strengthen emergency response capacity. a total of 18 dedicated responders with public health emergency response expertise can immediately mobilize and remain in the field for extended periods. GRRT surge capacity comprises >400 CDC staff members from around the agency. international experience of the surge staff is a median of 2 years (mean 5 years), totaling 1,577 years combined. more than half have emergency response experience and 13% have expertise in >1 foreign language. surge staff are on call 2 months each year for emergency mobilizations. GRRT has designed a comprehensive training curriculum for surge staff that includes safety, security, soft skills, and technical training. GRRT is also developing training focused on the principles of field team leadership in international response. GRRT supported the agency response by mobilizing 117 responders to 9 countries and territories for 151 mobilizations and 6,597 person-days. a total of 69 mobilizations and more than half of the response time (3,556 person-days) were in the CDC EOC. the GRRT roster facilitated the rapid identification of appropriate responders to fill response needs. GRRT will support CDC Zika virus response until no longer needed. fluent speakers of Portuguese and French were identified for mobilization to Angola and DRC. fluent Spanish speakers partially filled the language gap. hurricane Matthew made landfall in southwestern Haiti, causing major damage and flooding. 1,302 person-days were spent responding to hurricane Matthew. GRRT responders supported the response in a diversity of roles. the response demonstrated successful coordination of international and domestic response activities across the agency without burdening EOC staff. GRRT supported the agency response by mobilizing 117 responders to 9 countries and territories for 151 mobilizations and 6,597 person-days. a total of 69 mobilizations and more than half of the response time (3,556 person-days) were in the CDC EOC. the needs for assistance resulted in 90% of GRRT response time occurring in affected US territories and freely associated states. GRRT mobilized 15 responders to angola for 742 person-days and 7 responders to DRC for 211 person-days. four responders mobilized to WHO headquarters to coordinate with and support the WHO yellow fever outbreak response. by august 2016, the last confirmed cases of yellow fever were reported, and the disease did not spread to additional countries. GRRT and ERRB implemented the Incident Management System in the field and in ERRB workspace at CDC headquarters. GRRT mobilized the first wave of responders to Haiti 2 days after the hurricane struck. GRRT mobilized 31 responders to Haiti, 26 members to the Atlanta-based Incident Management System structure. GRRT support for CDC staff preparation and deployment readiness improves the speed at which qualified responders can be mobilized. despite progress, several challenges remain. the zika virus and yellow fever responses highlighted the need for strengthened language capacity. lessons learned from the establishment of GRRT at CDC can serve as a model for the creation of similar response units in other countries. GRRT has been actively engaged in strengthening agency and partner emergency response capacity by developing a capable emergency workforce."}
