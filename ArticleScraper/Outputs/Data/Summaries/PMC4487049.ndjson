{"summary": "HCT has antiviral, antibacterial, immunostimulant and other anti-inflammatory effects (1), which have led it to being widely used in the pharmaceutical industry and folk medicine (2\u20135) aqueous extract of HCT showed a significant stimulatory effect on the proliferation of mouse splenic lymphocytes. this effect was found to be dose-dependent (11). the results clearly indicate that HCI has anti-inflammatory activity against the SARS coronavirus. aqueous extract of HCT (HCWE) had anti-herpetic activity against HSV-2 and HSV-1 infection. this activity was associated with an inhibitory effect on NF-B pathway activation. Piglets infected with PrV die within a few days (17) enterovirus 71 (EV71) and coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16) are the two main pathogens of HFMD, which accounted for >70% of the total cases during an outbreak in china in 2008 (6). there have been no microbiological studies validating the usefulness of HCT for treating HFMD. aqueous extract of HCT had anti-herpetic activity against HSV-2 and HSV-1 infection. this activity was associated with an inhibitory effect on NF-B pathway activation. the results clearly indicate that HCI has anti-inflammatory activity against the SARS coronavirus. in a study conducted in chicken embryos and chickens (18), it was found that HCT inhibited IBV infection by >90% in chicken embryo kidney cells and reduced IBV-induced apoptosis by >90% in vivo and in vitro. dengue virus Dengue virus causes dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. aqueous extract of HCT showed a significant stimulatory effect on the proliferation of mouse splenic lymphocytes. HCT also showed an inhibitory effect on symptoms such as fever, sore throat and cough presented in early stage of SARS (12). the strongest inhibitory effect occurred at a dose of 0.54 ml/100 g. the results clearly indicate that HCI has anti-inflammatory activity against the SARS coronavirus. antibacterial activity Staphylococcus aureus Houttuynin is a keto-substituted aldehyde. houttuyfonate (SH), an addition compound of sodium bisulfite and houttuynin, exhibited antibacterial activity against 21 strains of Staphyloccus aureus grown in planktonic culture in vitro. the levels of autolysin atl, sle1, cidA and lytN transcripts in the SH-treated strain were decreased compared with those in the control strain. also, Lu et al (21) found that SH demonstrated in vitro antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates. other anti-inflammatory activity Membranous glomerulonephritis Pan et al (23) investigated the effect of SH on the membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN) induced by cationic bovine serum albumin (C-BSA) in mice. the C-BSA-induced increases in urinary protein were attenuated by treatment with SH. Houttuynia cordata supercritical extract (HSE) was able to reduce production of tumor-necrosis factor (TNF)- and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in a carrageenan-air pouch model of inflammation in mice. HSE exerts anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting TNF- and cyclooxygenase II-PGE2 pathways (25,26) HCWE increased intracellular level of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and markedly reduced mast cell activator-induced cAMP expression. results indicate that HCWE may be useful for the prevention of mast cell-mediated anaphylactic response. nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been shown to be significantly efficacious in the treatment of various inflammatory disorders. the expression levels of nuclear NF-B and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) were inhibited by SH in a dose-dependent manner. this study indicated that SH acted against C-BSA-induced MGN in the mice by suppressing the activation on NF-B and the expression of MCP-1. studies have indicated that HCT is able to efficiently inhibit IL-6, IL-8 and TNF- production (27,28). the continuous ingestion of a probiotic fermented four-herb combination (PFH) including HCT has been found to increase lysozymal activity in the serum and spleen, in addition to increasing peripheral blood mononuclear cell proliferation. RA is the most common inflammatory arthritis. it affects 0.5\u20131% of the general population worldwide (32,33)"}
