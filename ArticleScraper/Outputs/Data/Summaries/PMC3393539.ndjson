{"summary": "current influenza vaccines are prepared annually on the basis of the world health organization (WHO) forecasts on the most probable influenza virus strains thought to be circulating in the next seasonal outbreak (1). predicting the next pandemic virus, including when and where it will arise, is currently impossible. subclade 2.2 is further divided into subclades 2.3.1, 2.3.2.1, 2.3.3, 2.3.4, 2.3.4.1, 2.3.4.2, and 2.3.4.3 (38, 39). circulating HPAI H5N1 viruses fall into clades 0, 1, 2, and 7 (40, 42), and other clades that are circulating in avian species may be transmitted to humans either directly from avian species or indirectly through so-called \u201cmixing-vessel\u201d species. forrest et al. (18) compared single-versus multiple-clade H5N1 vaccines to induce cross-protection in ferrets. a DNA vaccine encoding multiple H5 HA elicited antibody responses in mice and chickens that could neutralize multiple strains of HPAI H5N1 when given in combination. mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium. mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium. HPAI H5N1 viruses A/Shenzhen/406H/06 and A/Cambodia/P0322095/05 were originally isolated from human patients at the Donghu Hospital in Shenzhen, China. a total of 17 codon-optimized H5 HA genes were synthesized by recursive PCR and overlap PCR. pSX (subclade 7.2), pHN (clade 8), and pST (clade 9), respectively. if the World Health Organization recommended candidate vaccine strains, we selected them. for other clades and subclades, we compared amino acid sequences of several strains for a given clade or subclade and then selected relatively conservative strains. 293 T packaging cells were cotransfected with 14 g of pHR\u2032CMV-Luc, 14 g of pCMVR8.2, and 5 g of DNA plasmid encoding vesicular stomatitis virus protein (VSV-G) to generate a panel of corresponding H5N1 pseudotypes. the cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and cultured in 10 ml of complete DMEM. the cells were then cultured in 10 ml of complete DMEM. the pseudotype-containing supernatants were harvested after 16 to 20 h. the cells were stained with human monoclonal antibody F10. HA and NA pseudotype-based neutralization assay used here was described previously. an HA and NA pseudotype-based neutralization assay was described previously. IC50 values were normalized as described previously (5). an outlier antigen or antiserum was defined as distant from its counterparts by more than two units, i.e., by >4 log2. 12 naive female BALB/c mice were i.p. injected with 700 l of immune sera. another 12 naive female BALB/c mice were i.p. injected with the same amount of sera collected from naive mice. mice were monitored and recorded daily for signs of illness, such as lethargy, ruffled fur, and weight loss. spleens were harvested from triclade DNA- and empty vector-vaccinated mice. they were stimulated with two HA peptides (IYSTVASSL and LYEKVRLQL [11, 19, 25], 2.5 g/ml for each peptide) and anti-CD28 and anti-CD49d antibodies (BD Pharmingen, 1 g/ml) in 24-well tissue culture plates. the response of each mouse was counted as an individual data point. differences were considered significant at P 0.05. animal experiments carried out at biosafety level 3 (BSL3) containment facilities. 95/05 were originally isolated from human patients at the Donghu Hospital in shenzhen, china, and at the Institut Pasteur in Cambodia. the 50% tissue culture infection doses (TCID50) and the 50% mouse lethal doses (MLD50) of the viruses were determined in MDCK cells and in BALB/c mice, respectively, and were calculated by the method of Reed and Muench (28). if the World Health Organization recommended candidate vaccine strains, we selected them. we compared amino acid sequences of several strains for a given clade or subclade. for other clades and subclades, we selected relatively conservative strains. 293 T packaging cells were cotransfected with 14 g of pHR\u2032CMV-Luc, 14 g of pCMVR8.2, and 5 g of DNA plasmid encoding vesicular stomatitis virus protein. after overnight incubation, the cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and cultured in 10. ml of complete DMEM supplemented with 100 M sodium butyrate for 8 h. the cells were then cultured in 10 ml of complete DMEM. the pseudotype-containing supernatants were harvested after 16 to 20 h. an HA and NA pseudotype-based neutralization assay was described previously (34). serially 2-fold-diluted serum samples were seeded onto 96-well culture plate in complete DMEM overnight. the different amounts of HA among the input H5N1 pseudotype panel were within the acceptable range described by Yang et al. an outlier antigen or antiserum was defined as distant from its counterparts by more than two units, i.e., by >4 log2. for active immunization and challenge experiments, female BALB/c mice were randomly divided into two groups. twelve naive female BALB/c mice were i.p. injected with 700 l of immune sera. 12 naive female BALB/c mice were i.p. injected with 700 l of sera. six mice per group were challenged i.n. with 100 MLD50 (5,623 TCID50) of A/Shenzhen/406H/06 strain in a volume of 50 l. splenocytes (106 cells/well) were stimulated with two HA peptides (IYSTVASSL and LYEKVRLQL [11, 19, 25], 2.5 g/ml for each peptide) and anti-CD28 and anti-CD49d antibodies (BD Pharmingen, 1 g/ml) in 24-well tissue culture plates at 37\u00b0C. after 6 h of incubation, the cells were refrigerated overnight cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibody responses and antigenic clusters among all H5 clades and subclades. we first constructed DNA plasmids expressing codon-optimized HA from 17 representative strains covering all reported clades and subclades of HPAI H5N1 viruses. we then used DNA plasmids to elicit corresponding immune sera in mice. al cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibody responses among clades 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 9 and among (sub)clades 0, 2.1.3.2, 2.2.1, 2.4, 2.5, and 8, suggesting that the antigenicity and immunogenicity of subclades and subclades within each of these two reciprocal groups correlate well with each other. 16 2,088 \u2013 pVN 4,265 3,620 3,097 322 1,253 \u2013 50 370 844 851 563 3,482 482 \u2013 405 1,861 \u2013 pCA 2,228 447 957 1,222 351 \u2013 757 \u2013 373 1,429 865

against autologous pseudotyped viruses are indicated in boldface. in the graph, one grid represents a 2-fold change in the pseudotype-based neutralization assay. the virus is represented by strain-(sub)clade, and the abbreviations for the H5N1 strains are listed in Table 1. similar trends were observed when a panel of H5N1 viruses were examined. immune sera elicited with the triclade DNA vaccine neutralized all H5N1 pseudotypes. the IC50 ranged from 1,062 against pSZ (subclade 2.3.4) to 9,311 against pHK156 (clade 0), and the IC90 ranged from 105 against pGX (subclade 2.4) and pHN (clade 8) to 933 against pHK156 (clade 0), respectively. splenocytes from triclade DNA- and empty vector-immunized mice were assayed against the two HA peptides using intracellular cytokine staining for IFN-, IL-2, and TNF-. triclade DNA vaccine also elicits HA-specific CD8 T-cell responses. the percentages of activated CD8+ T cells that produce IFN- (A), IL-2 (B) and TNF- (C) are shown. the percentages of activated CD8+ T cells that produce IFN- (A), IL-2 (B) and TNF- (C) are shown. triclade DNA vaccine confers protection against HPAI H5N1 viruses. mice were immunized three times with triclade DNA or with an empty vector. body weight (A and C) and survival (B and D) were recorded for 14 days. sera from naive mice became sick on day 3 after the challenge, developed all of the symptoms mentioned above, lost weight rapidly, and died between days 7 and 9. mice that had been passively immunized with sera from the triclade DNA vaccine group did not exhibit any sign of illness nor weight loss. triclade DNA vaccine elicits both broadly neutralizing antibody and HA peptide-specific CD8 T-cell responses. we first constructed DNA plasmids expressing codon-optimized HA from 17 representative strains covering all reported clades and subclades of HPAI H5N1 viruses. then used DNA plasmids to elicit corresponding immune sera in mice. we then performed an across-the-board pseudotype-based neutralization assay. we further analyzed the antigenic cartography based on IC50 values. subclades 2.3.4 and 7.1 neutralized most of immune sera except for sera from (sub)clades 1, 2.2.1, 2.3.2.1, 2.4, and 7.2, suggesting that the antigenicity and immunogenicity of subclade 2.3.4 or 7.1 do not correlate with each other. subclades 2.3.2.1 and 7.2 each stands on its own. 489

Figure 1 shows antigenic cartography based on IC50 values. accordingly, (sub)clades 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.1, and 9 were grouped into antigenic cluster 1, (sub)clades 2.1.3.2, 2.3.4, 2.4, 2.5, and 8 were grouped into another, with subclade 2.2.1 loosely connected to it. this is why immune sera elicited with pHK pSZ (subclade 2.3.4) to 9,311 against pHK156 (clade 0) and the IC90 ranged from 105 against pGX (subclade 2.4) and pHN (clade 8) to 933 against pHK156 (clade 0), respectively. in contrast, the empty vector immunized sera did not exhibit any neutralizing activity. CD8 T cells from empty-vector-immunized mice exhibited statistically significant peptide-specific responses against peptide I, peptide II, or both. on average, 2.2, 0.13, and 1.6% of the CD8 T cells from triclade DNA-immunized mice secreted IFN-, IL-2, or TNF- in response to peptide II. mice immunized with the triclade DNA were assessed. immune responses measured 10 days after the final boost. triclade DNA vaccine confers protection against HPAI H5N1 viruses. immunized mice were challenged with 100 MLD50 (50 TCID50) of A/Cambodia/P0322095/05 (A and B) and 100 MLD50 (5,623 TCID50) of A/Shenzhen/406H/2006 (C and D) after virus challenge, body weight (A and C) and survival (B and D) were recorded for 14 days. ambodia/P0322095/05 and slightly lost weight between days 4 and 9. triclade DNA vaccine elicits both broadly neutralizing antibody and HA peptide-specific CD8 T-cell responses. broadly neutralizing antibody responses alone could confer protection from a lethal-dose challenge of heterologous HPAI H5N1 viruses in mice. Vaccine candidates based on consensus, ancestral, mosaic, and multiclades of H5 HA sequences have been designed (7, 13, 27, 30) for reverse vaccinology, several broadly neutralizing antibodies against HA in influenza vaccinated and/or infected humans have been isolated. triclade vaccine consists of HA from (sub)clades 0, 2.3.2.1, and 7.2. it elicits neutralizing antibody responses against representative strains of all H5 clades and subclades. this does not imply that only this combination can elicit broadly neutralizing antibody responses against all H5 clades and subclades. cluster A contained subclade 2.1 and 2.4 viruses. cluster B contained clades 1, 4, 5, 7, and 9, cluster C contained subclades 2.2, 2.3.2, and 2.3.3, and cluster D contained subclades 2.3.2 and 2.3.4. similar findings were described in another study using HI assays using ferret or chicken polyclonal sera. subclade 2.3.2.1 tends to be more likely to be N-linked glycosylated at the amino acid position 181 than other clades and subclades at the same position. subclade 7.2 is very likely to have two additional N-linked glycosylations at positions 88 and 178. we speculate that the uniqueness in immunogenicity and antigenicity of subclades may be due to their differences in N-linked glycosylation pattern."}
