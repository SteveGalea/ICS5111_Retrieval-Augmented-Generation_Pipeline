{"summary": "a genetic association study of DC-SIGNR in a well-characterized cohort of 197 HIV-infected mothers and their infants recruited in Harare, Zimbabwe. the implicated H1 and H3 haplotypes share two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in promoter region (p-198A) and intron 2 (int2-180A) that were associated with increased risk of both IU and IP. disproportionately affecting the expression of membrane-bound isoforms compared to infant noncarriers. the rate of HIV-1 mother-to-child transmission is approximately 15\u201345%. MTCT of HIV-1 is responsible for one third of all deaths among children under the age of five. DC-SIGNR can internalize and mediate proteasome-dependant degradation of viruses that may differently affect the outcome of infection. a genetic association study of DC-SIGNR in a well-characterized cohort of HIV-infected mothers and infants recruited in Zimbabwe identified specific DC-SIGNR variants associated with increased risk of HIV transmission. samples were drawn from two groups: 97 HIV-1-positive mother/HIV-1-positive child pairs and 100 HIV-1-positive mother/HIV-negative child pairs. infants were considered to be infected if they were HIV-1 seropositive at 18 months or older. 57 infants were infected IU, 11 were infected IP and 17 were infected PP. htSNPs were genotyped in the 197 infants by direct PCR sequencing analysis. the DC-SIGNR exon 4 repeat region genotype was determined by PCR amplification followed by migration in 1.5% agarose gels. luciferase assays were performed using 20 g of protein extract. 0 g, 0,5 g or 1 g CMV-Tat vector was transfected with LTR-Luc. major PCR products from the second PCR reaction were gel extracted with the Qiagen Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen Canada inc, Mississauga, ON, Canada) for each placenta, 15 different clones were randomly selected and amplified with M13 primers and sequenced with ABI PRISM 3100 capillary automated sequencer (DNA Stars, Madison, WI, USA) standard curves (50\u2013500 000 copies per reaction) were generated using serial dilution of a full-length DC-SIGNR or commercial GAPDH (Invitrogen) plasmid DNA. all qPCR reactions had efficiencies ranging from 99% to 100%. first-term placental tissues were obtained from abortions following voluntary interruption of pregnancy at CHUM H\u00f4pital Saint-Luc (Montreal, Canada) 197 mother-child pairs co-enrolled immediately postpartum in the ZVITAMBO vitamin A supplementation trial. 57 of the 97 HIV-1-infected infants were infected IU, 11 were infected IP. infants who were DNA PCR positive at birth were infected IU. infants with negative PCR results at birth and 6 weeks of age were infected IP. the DC-SIGNR exon 4 repeat region genotype was determined by PCR amplification followed by migration in 1.5% agarose gels [10]. DNA sequences in the promoter region were analysed with the TESS interface (http//:www.cbil.upenn.edu/tess) 0 g, 0,5 g or 1 g CMV-Tat vector was transfected with LTR-Luc as a positive control. results are expressed as meanstandard error of the mean (S.E.M) sequences were aligned with GeneBank reference sequence NM_014257. quantitative expression of DC-SIGNR isoforms 1,5 g of placental RNA was reverse transcribed using 2.5 mM of Oligo dT20 and Expand RT in 20 l volume according to the manufacturer. samples from 2 subjects in each group were used because RNA quality of others was not suitable for a qRT-PCR analysis. the ratio of membrane-bound isoforms was calculated as E3/E5. soluble isoforms were calculated by subtracting membrane-bound from total isoforms. 197 infants born to untreated HIV-1-infected mothers recruited in Harare, Zimbabwe. 97 infants were HIV-1-infected and 100 infants remained uninfected. 57 were infected IU, 11 were infected IP, and 17 were infected PP. 0.18b 47 (7) 0.47c Gestational age (weeks) 37 95 (94) 98 (55) 0.34 (0.04\u20133.00) 80 (8) 4.70 (0.78\u201328.2) 94 (16) 1.18 (0.13\u201310.7) 37 5 (5) 2 (1) 0.42b 20 (2) 0.12b 6 (1) 1.00b Membrane rupture (hours) 0 \u2013 3 57 (56) 49 (26) 1.39 (0.71\u20132.71) 50 (5) 1.33 (0.36 b 65 (11) 0.005c CI, Confidence interval; F, female; M, male; OR, odds ratio; SD, standard deviation. Fifteen haplotype-tagged SNPs (htSNPs) corresponding to the 15 major DC-SIGNR haplotypes were genotyped in our study samples. homozygous infants for the p-198A and int2-180A variants had increased risk of IU (OR: 2.07 P = 0.045, OR: 3.78, P = 0.003, respectively) and IP (OR: 2.47, P = 0.17, O.R: 5.71, 95% CI = 1.40\u201323.3, P = 0.025, respectively) HIV-1 infection compared to heterozygote infants or noncarriers. a 18 (2) 0.11a 24 (4) 0.016a Haplotype H3-other/other-other 99 (98) 98 (50) 1.96 (0.12\u201332.0) 100 (11) NA 100 (17) NA H3-H3 1 (1) 2 (1) 1.00a 0 1.00a 0 1.00a Haplotype H1-H3 H1-other/H3-other/other-other 91 (90) 74.5 (38) 3.42 (1.35\u20138.68) splicing of the DC-SIGNR gene in the placenta produces both membrane-bound and soluble isoform repertoires. the relative proportion of membrane bound and soluble DC-SIGNR could plausibly influence the susceptibility to HIV-1 infection [11]. the deletion of exon 3 eliminates the trans-membrane domain of the protein. the abundance of membrane-bound isoforms in placental tissues of the H1 homozygotes appears to be lower than that observed in samples from WT individuals. homozygous H1 (int2-180AA) and homozygous WT (int2-180GG) placental samples estimated by qRT-PCR assays. differences between isoform proportions among the homozygous H1 and homozygous WT (int2-180GG) were calculated by the 2 test. the total number of DC-SIGNR transcripts was determined to be 685213 (DC-SIGNR copiesS.E.M per 105 GAPDH copies) in the placental samples from homozygous H1 infants was 4-fold lower compared to that found in placentas from WT individuals (2781638, P = 0.011) the effect of these mutations was more pronounced on the membrane-bound isoforms with an 8-fold decrease (H1 = gene constructs corresponding to the DC-SIGNR promoter region from \u2013715 to \u20131, spanning with either C (WT) or A at position 198. expression of the DC-SIGNR promoter constructs was calculated relatively to this value. two mutations shared by haplotypes H1 and H3 were associated with vertical transmission of HIV-1. the int2-180A was associated with a 4-fold increased risk of IU and 6-fold increased risk of IP after adjustment for the maternal factors. however, this mutation reduces DC-SIGNR transcriptional activity in vitro and produces lower level of DC-SIGNR transcripts in placental tissues. many studies have focused on the potential role of DC-SIGNR in trans infection of HIV-1 in vitro [2], [10]. however, the multiple mechanisms involved in trans infection and redundancy among C-type lectin functions make it difficult to determine the actual participation of DC-SIGNR in this mode of infection in vivo. the int2-180A variant contained in the H1 and H3 haplotypes was associated with IP transmission suggesting that DC-SIGNR also affect transmission of HIV-1 during delivery. the int2-180A variant was associated with IP transmission suggesting that DC-SIGNR also affect transmission of HIV-1 during delivery. suppressive ligand for CCR5 are associated with higher chemokine production and lower risk of MTCT of HIV-1 among infants. the presence of DC-SIGNR at the placental endothelial cell surface may protect infants from HIV-1 infection by capturing virus. interval; htSNPs, haplotypes-tagged single nucleotide polymorphisms; N, number; OR, odds ratio, NA; not applicable, Del; deletion. a P-value as determined by the Chi-square test.
