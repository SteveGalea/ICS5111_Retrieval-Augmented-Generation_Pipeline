{"summary": "early studies on the prevalence of respiratory viruses in asymptomatic individuals had limited sample sizes and focused on children (1\u20135) the detection rate of respiratory viruses in asymptomatic children exceeds 30% in some reports (6, 7), with even higher rates in infants (8). NP swab samples were prospectively collected from adults with and without ongoing symptoms of RTI during 12 consecutive months. the study subjects were recruited from three different primary care centers and three hospital emergency inpatient wards at a 2,000-bed teaching hospital in western Sweden. inclusion of study subjects was made by the study nurse. inclusion criteria were 18 years and symptoms consistent with RTI for a duration of 10 days. URTI was defined as an acute illness, usually with cough as the main symptom and at least one of the following symptoms from the lower respiratory tract. in-house multiplex PCR panel targets 16 viruses and four bacteria. the panel included influenza A (IFA) and influenza B (IFB) virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus (RV), enterovirus (EV), coronavirus (CoV) of four different types. nasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples were prospectively collected from adults with and without ongoing symptoms of RTI during 12 consecutive months (June 2015 to June 2016). a specially trained study nurse performed sampling and collection of baseline data. at 1 week postenrollment, asymptomatic study subjects underwent a telephone-based interview regarding the development of any symptoms of RTI within 4 days after sampling. individuals who were unable to accurately provide a history developed symptoms of RTI within 4 days after enrollment, had a history of fever, diarrhea, or antibiotic treatment in the preceding 2 weeks. NP swab samples were analyzed for presence of respiratory pathogens. the panel included influenza A (IFA) and influenza B (IFB) virus. the frequency of detection was compared with Pearson chi-square or Fisher\u2019s exact test, as appropriate. Factors associated with detection of virus or bacteria with a P value of 0.2 were considered statistically significant (2-sided) any chronic medical conditiond 286 (64) 62 (60) 0.4 Chronic heart disease 101 (23) 25 (24) 0.7 Diabetes mellitus 96 (22) 11 (11) 0.01 Chronic kidney disease 14 (3) 1 (1) 0.3 Chronic liver disease 4 (1) 0 0.6 Malignancy 21 (5) 11 (11) 0.02 IBD 12 (3) 4 (4) 0.5 Rheumatic disease 33 (7) 8 (8) 0.9 Immunodeficiency 29 (7) 6 (6) 0.8 Other chronic disease 62 (14) a respiratory pathogen was detected in 49 of 444 (11%) asymptomatic subjects. a respiratory pathogen was detected in 49 of 444 (11%) asymptomatic subjects. the most common virus was RV, followed by CoV. any pathogen (including bacteria) 49 (11) 51 (50) 0.0001 Any virus 19 (4.3) 37 (36) 0.001 >1 virus detectedb 0 0 Rhinovirus 14 (3.2) 23 (22) 0.001 Influenza A virus 0 2 (1.9) NC Coronavirus 2 (0.5) 6 (5.8) 0.0008 Enterovirus 1 (0.2) 0 NC Adenovirus 0 0 NC Parainfluenzavirus 1 (1.0) NC Bocavirus 1 (0.2) no other predictive factors associated with detection of virus or bacteria was identified in asymptomatic subjects or in reference patients with respiratory symptoms. a trend toward lower pathogen load was observed in asymptomatic compared with symptomatic subjects, but the difference was not statistically significant for any of the three pathogens. the most common virus was RV, followed by CoV. Streptococcus pneumoniae was found in 5.6% of the asymptomatic subjects. a bacterium in 5.7% (n = 7 Streptococcus pneumoniae and 1 Haemophilus influenzae) there were no significant differences in detection rates between the asymptomatic group and the group that was lost to FU. the detection rate was significantly higher among symptomatic subjects than among asymptomatic subjects. 51 out of 103 (50%) patients with RTI were positive for any respiratory pathogen, and in 37 cases (36%), a virus was detected. no one in this group had multiple virus detections. the difference was not statistically significant for any of the three pathogens. in 17 (43%) cases, a virus was detected (11 RV, 1 IFB virus, 1 CoV, 1 MPV, 1 PIV, and 1 RSV) thirty-one patients (78%) with LRTI reported treatment with antibiotics in the last 2 weeks compared to 3 (8.6%) cases with URTI. a relatively large proportion (43%) of the symptomatic subjects age 65 years stated having previous vaccination against IFA. more recent studies have reported a high frequency of respiratory viruses in asymptomatic children. in immunocompetent subjects, RV infections and concomitant virus shedding commonly resolve within 1 to 2 weeks. in immunocompetent subjects, RV infections are less frequent in adults without symptoms of RTI than what was reported by Granados et al., who found RV in about 8% of asymptomatic students. pneumococcal colonization in the elderly has been reported to be low (5%), with detection based on culture methods from nasopharyngeal samples. PCR-based finding of 4.1% pneumococcal carriage in adult nonsmokers is lower than in these previous reports. we used the WURSS score and CAP-Sym, both validated questionnaires, for symptom scoring in symptomatic cases (21, 23) 78% of patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria had been administered antibiotics in the last 2 weeks, compared to 8.6% of the patients with URTI."}
