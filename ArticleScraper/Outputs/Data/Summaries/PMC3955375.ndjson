{"summary": "systematic review of event-based surveillance was conducted by a national scientific institute. previous work included a systematic review of 17,510 peer-reviewed articles and 8,088 websites on surveillance systems for the early detection of bioterrorism. list of event-based systems Identified No. System name (literature reference) Category Country Country where the system started 4 Year started The year the system started operating 5 Coordinating organization The unit that operates the system 6 Purpose The purpose of the system 7 Geographic scope The geographic area covered 8 Language The number of languages the system covers or gets information from 9 Disease type Type of diseases covered by the system; >3 as \u201cmultiple infectious diseases\u201d 10 Accessibility The type of access: freely accessible to the general public vs restricted access 11 automatic or moderated systems can be classified as news aggregators, automatic systems, or moderated systems. the system overwhelmingly rely on media sources for data input, including local and national newspapers, news broadcasts, websites, news wires, or even short message service. ten of the systems are intended to improve early detection. Argus, BioCaster, GOARN, GODSN, GPHIN, healthMap, InSTEDD, MedISys, MiTAP, and Proteus-BIO. language five of the systems use English only. accessibility varies from system to system, depending on scope of the system and intended audience. some sensitive information (eg, personal data or other confidential data) is often filtered in specific ways. proMED-mail is the only system obtaining firsthand information from its subscribers. most of the systems we studied function as news aggregators. many systems use text-mining technology to extract only relevant data. the system aggregates the extracted events into outbreaks across multiple documents and sources before returning the extracted information to the system. the large amount of \u201cinformation noise\u201d also may be a hindrance, since users are then required to sift through it manually. articles are filtered into a category and stored in a database. 6 systems were disseminated through a secured or restricted portal. automatic systems can be classified as news aggregators, or moderated systems. two systems are meant to enhance communication or collaboration. one system supplements another (EpiSPIDER for ProMED-mail) most of the event-based systems are based in the united states, followed by the EU, and only 1 each is based in Canada and Japan. language five of the systems use English only (epiSPIDER, EWRS, GODSN, InSTEDD, and Proteus-BIO), though other systems are multilingual. InSTEDD is one of the few systems using information to advise organizations on strategic implementation. such systems provide timely information for preparedness, early warning, and responses. ten systems collect from the Internet (eg, RSS feeds or electronic mailing lists) EWRS uses an informatics tool that filters and relays information to users via a web-based system that links contact members of the EWRS network. inSTEDD and GPHIN incorporate human input and review, allowing users to add comments, tags, and ranks during the data-processing phases. healthMap alleviates noise by integrating data from a variety of electronic sources. the data is fed into a classification engine (ie, a parser), which uses the information to produce disease and location output codes. 4 systems are disseminated through a secured or restricted portal. systems often use automatic programming interfaces (APIs), a type of filter through which the data are passed in order to extract specific information. these APIs process, extract, augment, and compile the epidemiological attributes in the data (ie, metadata) from multiple sources. event-based systems often receive a high volume of information per day. new information about health events or probable cases is not always disseminated efficiently. event-based systems filter and organize information before it is presented to users. recent work has begun in this area to seek out information on health threats using mobile phone technology, Internet-scanning tools, email distribution lists, or networks that complement the early warning function of routine surveillance systems. the majority of event-based surveillance systems are based in North America and Europe, with fewer local, event-based systems monitoring epidemic threats in Africa, Asia, the South Pacific, and South America. the new IHR require the WHO to develop real-time event management systems for addressing public health risks and emergencies of international concern. innovative methods for screening information will no doubt become a priority as definitions of event-based surveillance are established and grow. the benefits to epidemiologists clearly are the data retrieved for analysis and potential public health warnings and intervention. the data's value to the early warning and detection of outbreaks needs to be demonstrated by evaluating the content found in social media and other Internet data sources. a usability study over time is needed to show how useful primary content would be. this is a circular dilemma, since the willingness to integrate is rooted in the lack of effectiveness studies. the number of factors necessary for integrating such services should not be underestimated. this includes time-consuming and costly collaboration with statisticians, internet and media experts, and computer scientists. studies of human behavior and Internet interaction may also clarify social and behavioral effects on content generated by social media and the Internet. health authorities who intend to use content from social media and other Internet data also need to consider protection and privacy. it remains unclear what data may be freely accessed and used and whether privacy laws and related issues will prevent the structured analysis of new data. the final keyword list was reviewed and agreed upon in collaboration with surveillance epidemiologists. the search was a combination of all the key terms generated by using Boolean functions of \"and\" and \"or\" the combined search terms retrieved 39,000 articles. 123 articles were identified as providing \u201cBackground\u201d information only. 166 articles were identified as describing an \u201cIndicator-Based System\u201d. our inclusion criteria were topics dealing with bioterrorism, security, sentinel surveillance, or any surveillance not based on human health and infectious diseases. the first stage of abstraction included applying our inclusion criteria only to titles. the combined search terms retrieved 39,000 articles. 123 articles were identified as providing \u201cBackground\u201d information only. 166 articles were identified as describing an \u201cIndicator-Based System\u201d."}
