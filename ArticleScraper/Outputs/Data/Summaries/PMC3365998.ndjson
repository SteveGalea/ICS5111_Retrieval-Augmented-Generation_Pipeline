{"summary": "type I interferons (IFNs) are cytokines that activate host pathways to inhibit the replication of viruses. humans deficient in components of type I IFN signaling are particularly vulnerable to viral disease. IFITM3 expression has been described to expand acidic cellular compartments (11) that stain positive for endolysosomal and autophagosomal markers, LAMP1, Rab7, and LC3. incoming influenza virus colocalizes with this acidic compartment and IFITM3 and is eliminated by 6 h post-infection. Western Blots HeLa cells, HEK293T cells, DC2.4 cells, and WT and ATG5/ MEFs were grown in DMEM supplemented with 4.5 g/liter d-glucose, 110 mg/liter sodium pyruvate, and 10% FBS (Gemini Bio-Products) cells were grown in 12-well plates to 50% confluence and transfected with 1 g of the indicated plasmids per well using Lipo for retroviral transduction of MEFs, IFITM3-HA coding sequence was cloned into pRetroX-IRES-ZsGreen1 using BglII and BamHI restriction sites. western blotting was performed with anti-HA antibody (Clontech, 631207) at 1:1000. typhimurium infections, strain IR715 were used. cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min. cells were stained using anti-HA anti-antibody (Covance, clone 16B12) directly conjugated to Alexa-488, -555, or -647 using kits for 100 g of antibody available from Invitrogen. proteins were immunoprecipitated and subjected to click chemistry reactions. proteins were subjected to click chemistry reactions containing 100 m azido-rhodamine (az-Rho), 1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP), 100 m tris[(1-benzyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methyl]amine (TBTA) and 1 cellular fractionation experiments were performed using freshly harvested cells and the Qiagen Qproteome Cell Compartment Kit followed by acetone precipitation and loading of 20 g of protein per lane for SDS-PAGE. cells were grown in 12-well plates on glass coverslips to 50% confluence and transfected with 1 g of the indicated plasmids per well using Lipofectamine 2000. western blotting was performed with anti-HA antibody at 1:1000. anti-GAPDH (Abcam, ab70699), anti-calnexin (Abcam, ab22595), anti-IFITM3 (Ab15592) and anti-ubiquitin (Covance) were also used at 1:1000 dilutions. anti-NP (Abcam, ab20343) was directly conjugated to Alexa-647. anti-myc (Clontech, 631206) was conjugated to Alexa-488. all conjugated antibodies were used at a 1:200 dilution in 0.2% saponin. LC-MS/MS analysis was performed on immunoprecipitated HA-IFITM3 peptides recovered from trypsin-treated gel slices with a Dionex 3000 nano-HPLC coupled to an LTQ-Orbitrap ion trap mass spectrometer. cells were grown in 12-well plates to 50% confluence and transfected with 1 g of the indicated plasmids per well using Lipofectamine 2000. the pCMV-H-IFITM3 construct has been described previously (10) Primers for generation of HA-IFITM3-Palm were previously described (10), and primers used to generate IFITM3 lysine mutants. anti-HA antibody (Clontech, 631207) at 1:1000 was used. anti-GAPDH (Abcam, ab70699), anti-calnexin (Abcam, ab22595), anti-IFITM3 (Ab15592) and anti-ubiquitin (Covance) were also used at 1:1000 dilutions. anti-calreticulin (Abcam, ab2907) was used at a 1:1000 dilution in PBS for 30 min. toPRO-3 (Invitrogen) was used at a 1:1000 dilution in PBS for 10 min. s recovered from trypsin-treated gel slices with a Dionex 3000 nano-HPLC coupled to an LTQ-Orbitrap ion trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher) cells were grown in 12-well plates to 50% confluence and transfected with 1 g of the indicated plasmids per well using Lipofectamine 2000. pSELECT-GFP-LC3 was purchased from Invivogen. Plasmids encoding GFP-Rab5, GFP-Rab7, and LAMP1-GFP have been previously described. infections, fluorescence microscopy, and Flow Cytometry Influenza virus A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) were propagated in 10-day embryonated chicken eggs for 40 h at 37 \u00b0C. cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min followed by a 10-min permeabilization with 0.2% saponin in PBS and a 10-min blocking step with 2% FBS in PBS. LC-MS/MS analysis performed on immunoprecipitated HA-IFITM3 peptides recovered from trypsin-treated gel slices with a Dionex 3000 nano-HPLC coupled to an LTQ-Orbitrap ion trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher) Peptides identified using SEQUEST Version 28 searched against the mouse (v3.45) and human (v3.56) protein sequence databases. IFITM3 is polyubiquitinated with Lys-48 and Lys-63 linkages. Western blot analysis showed additional higher molecular mass IFITM3-specific bands. ubiquitin was selectively identified in the upper bands. Western blotting was performed using -HA antibodies to visualize IFITM3 and ubiquitinated species. asterisks indicate modification with one, two, or three ubiquitin molecules. asterisks indicate the one lysine of four that is not mutated to alanine. analysis of lysine mutants using polyubiquitin linkage-specific antibodies showed that IFITM3 is ubiquitinated with Lys-48 linkages on all four lysine residues and most robustly on Lys-24. we examined potential interplay between palmitoylation and ubiquitination. immunoprecipitated proteins were reacted with az-rho via click chemistry. transfected cells were labeled with alkynyl palmitic acid reporter, alk-16, for 2 h. HA-IFITM3-Ub behaved similarly to HA-IFITM3, whereas the Palm mutant showed less partitioning into the membrane fraction compared with WT protein (Fig. 2D). HA-IFITM3 is primarily membrane-associated but is also present in cytoplasmic fractions at lower levels. wild type HA-IFITM3 signal decayed during the 4-h chase period. HA-IFITM3-Ub signal was relatively stable (Fig. 2, E and F) ubiquitination regulates IFITM3 stability, but the Ub mutant is not observed at higher levels than wild type protein. HA-IFITM3-Ub showed a distinct distribution to a perinuclear site away from calreticulin positive regions. human IFITM3 has also been reported to induce enlarged acidified compartments that stain positive for endolysosomal markers. immunofluorescence with -HA antibodies allowed IFITM3 visualization. -calreticulin staining allowed visualization of the ER. toPRO-3 was used to visualize nuclei. d down in IFITM3 expression or overexpressing IFITM3 constructs (8\u201311) infection rates are assessed using quantitative methods such as flow cytometry. HA-IFITM3-Palm has decreased activity compared with HA-IFITM3. increased antiviral activity of the Ub mutant was less pronounced on the Palm mutant background. p values were determined using Student's t test. data are representative of more than five experiments. HA-IFITM3 expression induces phosphatidylethanolamine modification of GFP-LC3. we overexpressed IFITM3 in both WT and ATG5/ cells. both cell types responded normally in terms of decreased infection. alteration of the GFP-LAMP1-positive compartment could still be observed. results are representative of at least three experiments. E, ATG5+/+ or ATG5/ MEFs were transfected with LAMP1-GFP. an Intramembrane Protein IFITM3 is proposed to be a dual-pass transmembrane protein with N and C termini both facing the lumen of the ER or endolysosome (8, 10, 11, 14) this topology model has not been conclusively established, nor is it consistent with observations regarding IFITM3 biochemistry and localization. we then engineered additional N-linked glycosylation sites at the N terminus (S38N), predicted cytoplasmic loop (D92N), and C terminus (H136T) each of the mutants showed antiviral activity similar to WT IFITM3, demonstrating these constructs are active and not significantly perturbed in function. HEK293T cells expressing IFITM3 constructs were analyzed for the percentage of cells that were infected. antiviral activity was calculated based on the difference in percentage of infection in HA-IFITM3-positive cells compared with vector control. palm indicates mutation of Cys-71, Cys-72, and Cys-105 to alanine. we reasoned that both ends of the molecule were accessible to cytoplasmic enzymes while retaining activity. if modified, these irreversible lipid modifications would tether the protein ends to the cytoplasmic face of the membrane bilayer. LVL showed largely overlapping localization when compared with a myc-tagged WT IFITM3. these irreversible lipid modifications rescued the membrane partitioning of the Palm mutant to a membrane:cytoplasmic ratio similar to the WT protein. both termini of active IFITM3 face the cytoplasm and the inherent membrane affinity of IFITM3 is likely due to intramembrane domains. ubiquitin blots were also seen for endogenous IFITM3 immunoprecipitated from MEFs and DC2.4 cells. two recent global proteomic studies of ubiquitinated proteins identified ubiquitinated peptides from endogenous IFITM3. ubiquitination is most prevalent on Lys-24 but can also occur on Lys-83, Lys-88, and Lys-104. analysis of lysine mutants using polyubiquitin linkage-specific antibodies showed that IFITM3 is ubiquitinated with Lys-48 linkages on all four lysine residues. orescence gel scanning along with Western blotting showed that IFITM3 deficient in S-palmitoylation (Palm) (10) was effectively ubiquitinated. IFITM3 that is both ubiquitinated and S-palmitoylated can be visualized by fluorescence gel scanning. fected cells were fractionated into membrane and cytosolic compartments. -Calnexin (CNX), -GAPDH, and -caveolin-1 (CAV1) Western blotting provided membrane, cytoplasmic, and intramembrane controls. transfected cells were labeled with homopropargylglycine (HPG; 250 mm) or alk-16 (50 m) for 2 h followed by chase. we analyzed turnover of wild type and ubiquitination-deficient IFITM3. we found that although wild type HA-IFITM3 signal decayed during the 4-h chase period, HA-IFITM3-Ub signal was relatively stable. ubiquitination regulates IFITM3 stability, but the Ub mutant is not observed at higher levels than wild type protein. non-ubiquitinated IFITM3 localizes to endolysosomal comparativtments. we also evaluated the cellular localization of the ubiquitination mutant. HA-IFITM3 colocalized with calreticulin similar to wild type HA-IFITM3. non-ubiquitinated IFITM3 localizes with endocytic and lysosomal markers. Ub indicates mutation of Lys-24, Lys-83, Lys-88, and Lys-104 to alanine. the scale bar indicates 10 m. IFITM3 has been shown to inhibit the influenza virus infection process before virus/endosome fusion (14) HEK293T cells were transfected overnight with indicated plasmids. ub indicates mutation of Lys-24, Lys-83, Lys-88, and Lys-104 to alanine. HA-IFITM3 expression induces phosphatidylethanolamine modification of GFP-LC3. phagy protein 5 (ATG5)-dependent pathway is required for antiviral activity. to test for antiviral activity, we targeted IFITM3 with siRNA. Knockdown of IFITM3 resulted in increased infection rates for both WT and ATG5/ cells. cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting with -HA, -GFP, and -ATG5 antibodies. B and C, ATG5+/+ or ATG5/ MEFs were treated with control siRNA targeting IFITM3 for 24 h. IFITM3 is proposed to be a dual-pass transmembrane protein with N and C termini facing the lumen of the ER or endolysosome (8, 10, 11, 14). however, this topology model has not been conclusively established, nor is consistent with observations regarding IFITM3 biochemistry and localization. IFITM3 N-terminal tags can be colocalized with lysosomal compartments. HA-IFITM3 levels are not increased by inhibiting lysosomal acidification. this non-glycosylated protein is protected from degradation by facing the cytoplasm. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmid expressing HA-tagged mannose 6-phosphate receptor (M6PR-HA) and the indicated HA-IFITM3 constructs. samples were split in two for mock treatment or treatment with peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) for 1 h. -Calnexin (CNX) and -GAPDH Western blotting provided membrane (M) and cytoplasmic (C) controls for blotting with -HA antibodies. numbers below the blots indicate the percentage of HA signal in that fraction for each IFITM3 construct. HA-IFITM3-Palm-CLVL construct is both myristoylated and prenylated. this construct maintained calreticulin colocalization similar to wild type IFITM3. anti-ubiquitin Western blot analysis of immunoprecipitated HA-IFITM3 confirmed that IFITM3 is modified with one, two, and three ubiquitin molecules. higher molecular weight IFITM3 species and positive anti-ubiquitin blots were also seen for endogenous IFITM3 immunoprecipitated. Western blotting was performed using -HA antibodies and antibodies specifically recognizing Lys-48- or Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains (-Lys-48 Ub and -Lys-63 Ub) asterisks indicate modification with one, two, or three ubiquitin molecules. asterisks indicate modification with one, two, or three ubiquitin molecules. ubiquitination and S-palmitoylation of IFITM3 have distinct roles. we examined potential interplay between palmitoylation and ubiquitination. IFITM3 deficient in S-palmitoylation (Palm) (10) was effectively ubiquitinated. 293T cells were transfected overnight with the indicated plasmids. ub indicates mutation of Lys-24, Lys-83, Lys-88, and Lys-104 to alanine. transfected cells were labeled with alkynyl-palmitic acid reporter, alk-16, for 2 h at 50 m. HA-IFITM3-Ub behaved similarly to HA-IFITM3, whereas the Palm mutant showed less partitioning into the membrane fraction compared with WT protein. we analyzed turnover of wild type and ubiquitination-deficient IFITM3. ubiquitination regulates IFITM3 stability, but the mutant is not observed at higher levels than wild type protein. we also performed a pulse-chase experiment using alk-16 to determine whether S-palmitoylation of IFITM3 is dynamic or irreversible. GFP-tagged LAMP1, Rab7, and Rab5 showed partial colocalization with HA-IFITM3-Ub. this colocalization is specific to a subset of endocytic markers. this colocalization is specific to a subset of endocytic markers. non-ubiquitinated IFITM3 localizes with endocytic and lysosomal markers. A, HeLa cells were transfected with empty vector or plasmids encoding HA-IFITM3 or HA-IFITM3-Ub along with the indicated GFP-tagged protein constructs. the increased antiviral activity of the Ub mutant was less pronounced on the Palm mutant background (Ub/Palm, Fig. 5) indicating that membrane interaction is still crucial even for non-ubiquitinated IFITM3. we suggest that IFITM3 targeting to the endolysosomal membrane is a critical determinant of antiviral potency. HA-IFITM3 expression induces the phosphatidylethanolamine modification of GFP-LC3 that enhances its clustering upon induction of autophagy. lipidated form of LC3 could be elevated by the addition of chloroquine, indicating that autophagic flux, i.e. maturation of IFITM3-induced autophagosomes, is occurring. we hypothesized that virus particles may be targeted to IFITM3-induced autophago types responded normally in terms of decreased infection when treated with IFN. alteration of the GFP-LAMP1-positive compartment could still be observed in ATG5/ MEFs expressing IFITM3-Ub. results are representative of two experiments. E, ATG5+/+ or ATG5/ MEFs were transfected with LAMP1-GFP. analyzed by flow cytometry for the percentage of infected cells. IFITM3 possesses two glycosylation motifs. one being at the N terminus predicted to be lumenally localized. there has been no report of IFITM3 glycosylation in the ER. lycosidase F had no effect on the mobility of IFITM3 regardless of the mutant tested. a control protein, HA-tagged mannose 6-phosphate receptor, known to be glycosylated, showed a band collapse upon digestion of N-linked glycans. each mutant showed antiviral activity similar to WT IFITM3, demonstrating these constructs are not significantly perturbed in function. cells were labeled with alkynyl-myristoylation (alk-12) or alkynyl prenylation (alk-FOH) reporters for 4 h at 50 m. immunoprecipitated proteins were reacted with az-rho via click chemistry. insertion of an N-terminal myristoylation motif and C-terminal CAAX box would allow us to assess accessibility of the termini to cytoplasmic myristoyl and prenyl transferases. if modified, these irreversible lipid modifications would tether the protein ends to the cytoplasmic face of the membrane bilayer similar to the alternative topology we propose. IFITM3 is polyubiquitinated with Lys-48 and Lys-63 Linkages. both termini of active IFITM3 face the cytoplasm and the inherent membrane affinity of IFITM3 is likely due to intramembrane domains rather than transmembrane domains as had been postulated. immunoprecipitation was performed on cell lysates using -HA agarose. Western blotting was performed using -HA antibodies. asterisks indicate modification with one, two, or three ubiquitin molecules. ubiquitination is most prevalent on Lys-24 but can also occur on Lys-83, Lys-88, and Lys-104. analysis of lysine mutants using polyubiquitin linkage-specific antibodies showed that IFITM3 is ubiquitinated with Lys-48 linkages on all four lysine residues and most robustly on Lys-24. ubiquitination and S-palmitoylation of IFITM3 have distinct roles. A, MEFs were treated for 6 h with IFN before an additional 2 h treatment with IFN and alkynyl palmitic acid reporter, alk-16. glycine (HPG; 250 mm) or alk-16 (50 m) for 2 h followed by chase with media containing either 5 mm methionine or 100 m palmitate. fluorescence signal was normalized to Western blots to control protein loading. values were plotted relative to 0 h of chase. nonradioactive pulse-chase method utilizing an alkynyl methionine surrogate. HA-IFITM3-Ub signal decayed during the 4-h chase period. HA-IFITM3-Ub signal was relatively stable (Fig. 2, E and F) lysine mutants of HA-IFITM3 colocalized with calreticulin similar to wild type HA-IFITM3 K24A. in contrast, HA-IFITM3-Ub showed a distinct distribution to a perinuclear site away from calreticulin positive regions. non-ubiquitinated IFITM3 localizes with endocytic and lysosomal markers. -HA antibodies allowed IFITM3 visualization, and -calreticulin staining allowed visualization of the ER. IFITM3 has been shown to inhibit the influenza virus infection process before virus/endosome fusion (14), antiviral activity is determined by comparing rates of infection for control cells and cells knocked down in IFITM3 expression or overexpressing IFITM3 constructs (8\u201311). infection rates are assessed using quantitative methods such as flow cytometry and staining with virus protein-specific antibodies. cells expressing IFITM3 constructs were analyzed for the percentage of cells that were infected using influenza-specific anti-NP antibodies. p values were determined using Student's t test. data are representative of more than five experiments. Knockdown of IFITM3 resulted in increased infection rates for both WT and ATG5/ cells. overexpression of IFITM3 resulted in decreased infection rate for both WT and ATG5/ cells. p values were determined using Student's t test. results are representative of at least three experiments. IFITM3 is proposed to be a dual-pass transmembrane protein with N and C termini both facing the lumen of the ER or endolysosome (8, 10, 11, 14). however, this topology model has not been conclusively established. to evaluate the membrane protein topology of IFITM3 we generated several constructs with N-linked glycosylation sites in different regions of the protein. we then engineered additional N-linked glycosylation sites at the N terminus (S38N), predicted cytoplasmic loop (D92N), and C terminus (H136T) each of the glycosylation site insertion mutants showed antiviral activity similar to WT IFITM3. HA-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated and samples were split in two for mock treatment or treatment with peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) for 1 h. western blotting showed that IFITM3 does not undergo a band shift characteristic of glycosylation. antiviral activity was calculated based on the difference in percentage of infection in HA-IFITM3-positive cells compared with vector control. insertion of an N-terminal myristoylation motif and a C-terminal prenylation site would allow us to assess accessibility of the termini to cytoplasmic enzymes. the diffuse staining reported for HA-IFITM3-Palm (10) was not observed. G-HA-IFITM3-Palm-CLVL showed largely overlapping localization. these irreversible lipid modifications rescued the membrane partitioning of the Palm mutant to a membrane:cytoplasmic ratio similar to the WT protein. non-ubiquitinated and S-palmitoylated IFITM3 represent the most active protein population for sequestration and degradation of incoming virus particles. the discovery of IFITM3 ubiquitination may also resolve some conflicting observations and raises questions regarding protein to vesicle targeting mechanisms. a portion of IFITM3 fractionates with cytoplasmic proteins and membrane association is enhanced by S-palmitoylation. this fractionation pattern is similar to what has been observed for the palmitoylated intramembrane protein caveolin (21). a recent bioinformatics study has suggested that IFITMs make up a larger family of proteins with dual-pass transmembrane segments than was previously appreciated. dysspanin may be a more appropriate moniker for this family, although a nomenclature change in general is premature until the topology of additional IFITM family members can be ascertained. lacking all IFITM isoforms possess normal germ cells and are fertile (41) the role of IFITM3 in tumor progression is unknown. identification of cellular pathways that modulate IFITM3 activity may provide important insight into these areas."}
