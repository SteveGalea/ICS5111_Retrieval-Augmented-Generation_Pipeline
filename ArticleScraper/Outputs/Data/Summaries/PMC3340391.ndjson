{"summary": "the family is divided into two subfamilies: paramyxoviridae and Pneumovirinae. all paramyxoviruses isolated from avian species are classified into the genus Avulavirus, except avian metapneumoviruses. APMVs encode a nucleocapsid protein (N), a phosphoprotein (P), a matrix protein (M), a fusion protein (F), a hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein (HN) and a large polymerase protein (L) APMVs encode a nucleocapsid protein (N), a phosphoprotein (P), a matrix protein (M), a fusion protein (F strains are categorized into three main pathotypes: lentogenic (avirulent), mesogenic (moderately virulent), and velogenic (virulent), based on their pathogenicity in chickens. APMV-2 and -3 have been reported to cause significant disease in poultry. pathogenic potential of APMV-4 to -9 is generally unknown. the pathogenicity of APMV-2 and APMV-3 has been studied in experimentally infected chickens. however, replication, pathogenicity, and neurovirulence of APMV serotypes 2 through 9 have not been comprehensively studied. we characterized in vitro replication of APMVs and their in vivo replication and tropisms. all of the viruses were grown in 9-day-old embryonated specific-pathogen-free chicken eggs inoculated by the allantoic route. the ability of viruses to produce plaques was tested on vero and DF1 cells under 0.8% methylcellulose overlay. APMV-1 LaSota, APMV-3, -8, and -9 were supplemented with protease. supernatants were collected and replaced with an equal volume of fresh medium. titers were expressed as 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50/ml) 0.05 ml of fresh infective allantoic fluid for each virus was inoculated into group of 10 1-day-old SPF chicks. the birds were observed for clinical symptoms and mortality once every 8 h for a period of 10 days. neuronal cells were determined by collecting supernatants at 12-h intervals until 72 hpi. ten 1-day-old SPF chicks were inoculated with 110 dilution of fresh infective allantoic fluid for each virus via intracerebral route. two birds were sacrificed daily until 5 days post-infection (dpi) spleen, and brain were collected and processed for immunohistochemistry. tissue samples were also inoculated into 9-day-old embryonated chicken eggs. the remaining birds were observed daily for 10 days for any clinical signs. chicken embryo fibroblast cell line (DF1, ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) was grown in Eagle\u2019s minimum essential medium (EMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and maintained in DMEM with 5% FBS. viruses used in this study were nine prototype strains of APMV serotypes 1 to 9. all of the viruses were grown in 9-day-old embryonated specific-pathogen-free chicken eggs inoculated by the allantoic route. the ability of viruses to produce plaques was tested on vero and DF1 cells under 0.8% methylcellulose overlay. exogenous protease was supplemented into the cells for replication of APMV-1 LaSota, APMV-3 and -9 (10% allantoic fluid) and APMV-8 (1 g/ a series of 10-fold dilutions of infected allantoic fluid (0.1 ml) was inoculated into the allantoic cavities of five 9-day-old eggs per dilution and incubated at 37\u00b0C. the eggs were examined once every 8 h for 7 days, and the time of embryo death was recorded. the ICPI is the mean of the score per bird per observation over the 8-day period. highly virulent velogenic viruses give values approaching 2. avirulent or lentogenic strains give values at or close to 0. two birds were sacrificed daily until 5 days post-infection. brain tissue samples were collected from the sacrificed birds. virus titers were determined by limiting dilution and immunoperoxidase assay. dpi, virus growth was determined by HA assay. six birds were infected with 500 l of individual APMVs. the remaining birds were observed daily for 10 days for any clinical signs. APMVs in cell culture Syncytium formation is a hallmark of the cytopathic effect (CPE) caused by many paramyxoviruses, including APMV-1, in cell culture. APMVs produced distinctive CPE with syncytium formation similar to those of APMV-1 strain BC. APMVs produced single cell infections leading to cell rounding and detachment of infected cells but a lack of evident syncyt APMV-1 strain BC and APMV-1 lentogenic strain LaSota grew better than any other APMVs. APMV-3 replicated relatively well, reaching 107 TCID50/ml at 32 and 60 hpi. pathogenicity of APMVs was evaluated with the standard pathogenicity tests used for APMV-1. strain BC is neurovirulent (MDT 58 h and ICPI 1.55), whereas strain LaSota is avirulent (MDT 112 h and ICPI 0.00) and is used as a vaccine strain. 0.00 APMV-2 Yucaipa Chicken KPASRF >144 h 0.00 APMV-3 Netherlands Parakeet RPRGRL 117 h 0.53 APMV-4 Hong Kong Duck APEPRL >144 h 0.00 APMV-7 Tennessee Dove LPSSRF >144 h 0.00 APMV-8 Delaware Goose YPQTRL >144 h 0.00 APMV-9 New York Duck IREGRI >144 h 0.00 a Mean MV-1 strain BC failed to replicate in neuronal cells even after supplementation with allantoic fluid as a source of protease. APMV-3 was able to replicate well without the addition of allantoic fluid. the presence of APMV-7 and -8 antigens in infected cells was sporadically detected. viral titers were determined by limiting dilution on DF1 or Vero cells. APMV serotypes were able to replicate in chicken brains by inoculating 1-day-old chicks via intracerebral route. infected chicks infected with neurovirulent APMV-1 strain BC, virus reached the highest titer in the brain at 2 dpi. ten 1-day-old chicks were inoculated with APMVs via intracerebral route. two birds in each group were sacrificed daily until 5 dpi. neurotropism of APMVs in 1-day-old chicks also evaluated by immunohistochemistry analysis. chicks infected with APMV-1 strain BC began to show clinical signs on 1 dpi and distinctive neurological signs on 2 dpi. chicks infected with other APMVs had no apparent clinical signs during the 3-day post-infection. trachea, lung, spleen, and brain were harvested for quantitative virology. dilution in DF1 cells and immunostaining with polyclonal antibodies raised against the respective N protein. APMV-1 strain BC replicated in the trachea, lungs, and spleen, but not the brain. APMV-3 replication was detected only in the trachea and the brain. on 10 dpi, none of the APMVs were detected in any of the sampled tissues from any of the birds. clinical signs of illnesses in any of the infected groups were not found up to 10 dpi. Table 2. Replication of APMVs in 2-week-old chickens. lymphocytic tracheitis, mild to moderate multifocal mucosal attenuation and loss of tracheal alveolar mucous glands exhibit moderate, multifocal, lymphocytic to lymphohistiocytic bronchitis with mild to moderate perivascular and peribronchial interstitial inflammation. microscopic lesions were not found in any of the brain tissues. trachea (A) showed mild lymphocytic tracheitis, mild to moderate multifocal mucosal attenuation, and loss of tracheal alveolar mucous glands. the presence of antigens for most APMVs was detected in the epithelial lining of trachea (C) and in the epithelium surrounding the medium and small bronchi of the lungs (D) APMVs were detected in some of the samples of trachea, lung, and spleens. none of the APMVs (including APMV-1) were detected in any of the brain samples. APMV-1 strains BC and LaSota were the only APMVs detected in all three ducks in their respective groups. replication was mostly restricted to the trachea. 0/3 3/3 0/3 0/3 APMV-2 0/3 1/3 0/3 0/3 APMV-4 0/3 2/3 2/3 0/3 APMV-8 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 APMV-1 strain BC was known to be independent of protease supplementation. APMV-3 and -5 produced distinctive CPE with syncytium formation similar to those of APMV-1. in contrast, the rest of APMVs produced single cell infections leading to cell rounding and detachment of infected cells. the highest titers of APMV-2 and -5 also were detected at 72 hpi. their titers were 4.0 log10 lower than those of APMV-1. in general, replication of other APMV viruses was limited in DF1 cells. APMV 2\u20139 were even more avirulent based on these assays than strain LaSota. the one exception was APMV-3, which had a MDT value (117 h) that is similar to that of the LaSota strain, but had an ICPI value (0.53) that was higher than that of the LaSota strain (0.00), but nonetheless remained in the avirulent range. pathotype definition for APMV-1: virulent strains, 60 h; intermediate virulent strains, 60 to 90 h; avirulent strains, >90 h. b Intracerbral pathogenicity index: evaluation of disease and death following intracerebral inoculation in 1-day-old SPF chicks. APMV-3 in neuronal cells increased gradually and reached 5.5 and 3 log TCID50/ml. other APMVs, including APMV-1 strain LaSota, were not detected in the supernatants of neuronal cells. APMV-3 strain reached a titer of 5 log10 TCID50/g on 3 dpi. the non-neurovirulent LaSota strain was detected at low titer on day 1. APMV-8 was identified as the only neurotropic virus among APMV serotypes 2\u20139. APMV-1 strain BC replicated to high titers (>5.0 log10 TCID50/g) in each of the samples. APMV-3 replicated to moderate titers (>4.0 log10 TCID50/g) replication of other APMVs was restricted to the trachea, lungs, and spleen. chicks infected with APMV-1 strain BC began to show clinical signs on 1 dpi and distinctive neurological signs on 2 dpi. chicks infected with other APMVs had no apparent clinical signs during the 3-day post-infection. APMV-3 replication was detected only in the trachea and the brain. APMV-2 was also able to replicate in trachea of 2-week-old chickens. however, replication of the other APMVs was not detected in any of the harvested tissue samples. APMV-3 2/3 3/3 3/3 2/3 APMV-4 0/3 1/3 0/3 0/3 APMV-6 0/3 2/3 0/3 APMV-8 0/3 2/3 0/3 0/3 APMV-8 0/3 2/3 0/3 0/3 APMV-8 0/3 2/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 APMV-9 0/3 3/3 1/3 0/3 0/3. deparaffinized sections of the virus-infected and uninfected control tissue were immunostained using polyclonal antibodies against the N protein of the respective APMV. the presence of antigens for most APMVs was detected in the epithelial lining of trachea. the presence of antigens for most APMVs was detected in the epithelial lining of trachea (C) and in the epithelium surrounding the medium and small bronchi of the lungs (D) the Mock infected panel of Figure 7A and the Mock infected panel of Figure 7B are excluded from this article's CC-BY license. APMV-3 was found only in the trachea of a single duck. APMV-8 and -9 were not detected in any duck. APMV-7 was the only serotype detected in the spleen of a single duck. each sample (100 l) in the collected samples was inoculated into three eggs. APMV-5 was not analyzed because it does not replicate in the allantoic cavity of chicken eggs. APMV-1 (NDV) is the most extensively characterized member of the APMV serotypes. APMV-1 strain BC readily forms syncytia in cell culture and replicates more efficiently in vitro than any of the other APMVs. the cleavage site of APMV-3 (RPRGRL) lacks the furin motif. efficient growth and syncytium formation depended on supplementation with exogenous protease, resembling an avirulent APMV-1 strain. the level of replication of APMV-5 in cell culture was very similar to that of APMV-2, which lacks a furin motif (KPASRF), does not form syncytia, and whose replication and lack of ability to form syncytia are independent of exogenous protease. the other APMVs (types 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9) have one or two basic amino acids in their cleavage site sequences. APMV-3 was categorized as avirulent by the standards of these assays. the other types were less virulent than the well-known avirulent vaccine strain APMV-1 laSota. APMV-5 did not correlate with virulence in vivo, nor did the ability of APMV-2 to replicate to moderate titers. the lack of neurotropism of the APMV-1 strain LaSota is consistent with this idea. however, APMV-3 appears to be an exception, since it lacks a furin cleavage site and is dependent on added protease in cell culture. however, while APMV-3 was clearly neurotropic, it caused no disease or death and thus was not neurovirulent. in 1-day-old chicks, only the APMV-1 strain BC and APMV-3 were able to spread to the brain and replicate, demonstrating neuroinvasiveness and neurotropism. replication of the other APMVs was mostly detected the in trachea of chicks, and the virus titers were moderate. the serologic assay of chickens that had been inoculated with APMV-5 also showed the development of virus specific antibodies detected by virus plaque reduction neutralization assay. this suggests a low level of virus replication in chickens. APMV serotypes 2\u20139 replicated to low-to-moderate titers in trachea of chickens. only APMV3 replicated systemically and was neuroinvasive and neurotropic, although not neurovirulent. APMV-5 was the only one of serotypes 2\u20139 to have a furin site. genetics will enhance our understanding of overall APMV pathogenesis."}
