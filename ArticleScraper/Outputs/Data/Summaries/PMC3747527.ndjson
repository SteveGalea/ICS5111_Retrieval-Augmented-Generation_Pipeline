{"summary": "technical guidelines on prevention and control of hospital-acquired human infection with influenza A (H7N9) virus are developed to guide the health care providers to improve the prevention and control for hospital-acquired human infection with influenza A (H7N9) virus. the health care providers should establish early-warning system and develop emergency preparation plan and workflow based on following considerations. 2.1. Fever clinic A workflow consisting of isolation, transfer, and management of suspected and confirmed cases should be established. the medical staff must follow the standard prevention principles during the diagnosis. medical staff must wear surgical masks when contacting each patient. the suspected or confirmed patient should be managed and cared by a special team of medical staff. medical staff who are not directly involved in the management should be restricted from entering the ward. terminal disinfection should be performed according to the technical Specifications for Implementing Disinfection in Hospitals. medical staff must timely perform hand hygiene before and after each contact with the patients in accordance with the standard protection principles. the medical staff must wear non-sterile gloves when contacting blood, other body fluids, secretions, excretions, and vomit of the patients and the contaminated items. the medical staff must wear surgical masks, goggles, and gowns. terminal disinfection should be performed according to the Technical Specifications for Implementing Disinfection in Hospitals. the corpse should be bounded with a double-layer fabric, wrapped into a double-layer plastic bag, and then sent directly to a designated place for cremation. if cremation is not feasible due to ethnic or religious concerns, the corpses should be buried deep as required after having been handled as described above. s from the diagnosis and treatment of patients with human H7N9 virus infection should be properly managed and disposed according to the Medical Waste Management Regulations and Medical Waste Management Methods in Health Care Institutions. 2.1. Fever clinic A workflow consisting of isolation, transfer, and management of suspected and confirmed cases should be established. the suspected or confirmed patient should be managed and cared by a special team of medical staff. medical staff who are not directly involved in the management should be restricted from entering the ward. the patients should be treated in negative pressure rooms or transferred to a special hospital. medical staff must take contact and droplet precautions based on the transmission pathways of the infection. medical staff must timely perform hand hygiene before and after each contact with the patients. medical staff must wear non-sterile gloves when contacting blood, other body fluids, secretions, excretions, and vomit of the patients. terminal disinfection should be performed according to the Technical Specifications for Implementing Disinfection in Hospitals. the corpse should be bounded with a double-layer fabric, wrapped into a double-layer plastic bag, and then sent directly to a designated place for cremation. if cremation is not feasible due to ethnic or religious concerns, the corpses should be buried deep as required after having been handled. general wards Contingency isolation rooms should be available in the general wards for the isolation and management of suspected/confirmed cases. medical staff must carry out personal protection and hospital environment management in strict accordance with the standard prevention principles. medical staff must put on or take off protective equipment correctly according to the best medical management practices for Isolation. a patient needs to leave the isolation ward or isolation zone, he/she must take appropriate protective measures (e.g., wearing a surgical mask) to avoid cross-infection; Stethoscope, thermometer, blood pressure monitors, and other medical devices for the suspects and cases must be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected. the medical staff must take contact and droplet precautions based on the transmission pathways of the infection in accordance with the standard protection principles. medical equipment and instrument must be properly cleaned and disinfected according to the Technical Specifications for Implementing Disinfection in Hospitals. 2.6. patient management The suspects and cases must be timely isolated, and be specifically guided to enter the isolation wards via the assigned route. the avian influenza virus subtypes are identified by the presence of proteins on the surface of the virus. there are 16 different H antigens (H1 to H16) and nine different N antigens (N1 to N9) the virus can also cause disease in humans, swine, equine, mink, and marine mammals. clinical manifestations Currently the high-risk populations include individuals involved in the slaughter, processing, and sale of poultry products and those who have exposed to birds one week before disease onset. the typical incubation period of influenza A (H7N9) virus is 7 days. the disease progresses rapidly in critically ill patients, showing multiple ground-glass opacities and pulmonary consolidation in both lungs. a small amount of pleural effusion may be found in some cases. the clinically diagnosed and confirmed patients with H7N9 avian influenza human infection must be properly isolated and treated 5.2. oseltamivir or zanamivir has shown certain efficacy in treating H5N1 and H1N1 avian influenza human infections. the recommended oral dose of zanamivir for adult is 75 mg (150 mg for severe cases) twice daily for 5-7 days. Decoction was orally taken once or twice (every 4-6 hours) a day with water. for patients with severe cough, Loquat leaf and Zhejiang Fritillaria can be added. the antimicrobial drugs are used only when there is confirmed secondary bacterial infection or when there is sufficient evidence prompting the presence of secondary bacterial infection. patients with respiratory dysfunction should be provided with oxygen inhalation and other respiratory supports. avian influenza (AI) virus belongs to the genus of the orthomyxoviridae family. they are highly pleomorphic and enveloped, with the spherical virions ranging in size from 80-120 nm in diameter. there are 16 different H antigens (H1 to H16) and nine different N antigens (N1 to N9) virus may be transmitted through the respiratory tract or by exposing to the secretions or excretions of the infected birds. direct exposure to the virus can also result in infection. there is apparently no evidence of human-to-human transmission. the disease progresses rapidly in critically ill patients, manifested as severe pneumonia. the patients can rapidly develop acute respiratory distress syndrome, mediastinal emphysema, sepsis, shock, unconsciousness, and acute kidney injury. patients develop acute respiratory distress syndrome, mediastinal emphysema, sepsis, shock, unconsciousness, and acute kidney injury. the disease progresses rapidly in critically ill patients, manifested as severe pneumonia. prognostic factors may include age, underlying disease, and complications. diagnosis may be made based on clinical manifestations, auxiliary examinations, and laboratory test results. 9 avian influenza human infection may be made based on epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory findings. diagnosis may be made based on clinical manifestations, auxiliary examinations, and laboratory test results. patients with unknown epidemiological history must be properly isolated and treated 5.2. the recommended oral dose of zanamivir for adult is 75 mg (150 mg for severe cases) twice daily for 5-7 days. the recommended dose of zanamivir for adult is 10 mg, inhaled, twice daily. the ion channel M2 blockers should not be applied alone. treatment: clearing Lung, detoxication, elimination of pathogen, and support of resistance. angongniuhuang Pill may be added for patients with high fever, trance, and even coma and delirium. mechanical ventilation for severe cases may follow the principles of mechanical ventilation for ARDS: non-invasive positive pressure ventilation. severe cases respond poorly to non-invasive ventilation and must undergo invasive ventilation as early as possible. laboratory experiments have shown that the virus is resistent to both amantadine and rimantadine. the ion channel M2 blockers should not be applied alone. symptoms: fever, cough with little phlegm, headache, muscle and joint pain. nasogastric tube may be added once or twice (every 4-6 hours) a day. for patients with high fever, trance, and even delirium, angongniuhuang Pill may be added. for patients with hemoptysis, Radix paeoniae rubra, Agrimony, and Chinese arborvitae twig and leaf may be added. prone ventilation or high-frequency oscillatory ventilation may be applied. complications, particularly hospital-acquired infections, must be prevented and timely treated."}
