{"summary": "enveloped viruses initiate infection by attaching to receptors on host cells. the fusion process is mediated by a specialized surface glycoprotein. some type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs) are responsible for cleavage of the hemagglutinin (HA) protein of influenza A virus (IAV) in the human airway. HPIV2 (2331-Yamagata-2009 strain) and HPIV3 (1835-Yamagata-2009 strain) were used in the present study. in the absence of trypsin, none of these HPIV strains produced plaques in Vero cells. all HPIVs showed plaque formation clearly in Vero/TMPRSS2 cells. peptides from cell lysates were blotted and treated with the ECL Plus reagent (Amersham Biosciences) chemiluminescence signals on the membrane were detected and visualized with a VersaDoc 3000 imager (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) to generate SeV-RFP(wt), the RFP gene was inserted into the 3\u2032-end-proximal first locus of the SeV genome. possessed uncleaved F proteins were incapable of entering cells. so, TMPRSS2 proteolytically activated the F protein of the incoming SeV particles, as was observed for IAV (17). this data demonstrated that TMPRSS2 proteolytically activated the SeV F protein intracellularly during the process of seV assembly. cells were infected with SeV-RFP(wt) at an MOI of 0.01, cultured in the presence or absence of trypsin. virus particles released from these cells were purified and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting for detection of the F proteins. mutated hexanucleotide sequences correspond to amino acid residues at positions 114 and 115 of the Q114A, Q114S, Q114V, S115R, and S115V mutants. infectious SeV mutants were generated by using a reverse-genetics technique (15) Q114S, -RFP/Q114A, -RFP/Q114V, and -RFP/S115V also showed impaired replication capacities that were reduced by 10-fold. however, pulse-chase labeling followed by immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE showed little, if any, effects of the mutations on the cleavage of the F proteins of the recombinant SeVs in Huh7/TMPRSS2-18 cells. monolayers of Huh7/TMPRSS2-18 and Huh7/TMPRSS2m-4 cells were infected with wt and mutant-SeV-RFPs. monolayers of wt- and mutant-SeV-RFP-infected cells were infected at an MOI of. 0.01, cultured in the absence of trypsin, and observed daily using a fluorescence microscope. cells were infected with wt and mutant SeV-RFPs at an MOI of 0.001. cells were examined for their virus titers (CIU) at 5 days postinfection. TMPRSS2 and matriptase are responsible for activation of the IAV HA (22) in Calu-3 and Caco-2 cells, TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4 are responsible for activation of the IAV HA (22) mutant seVs also underwent multiple rounds of infection in both cell lines. many proteases have been shown to activate respiratory viruses. trypsin is commonly used for the propagation of IAV, HMPV, SeV, and HPIVs in cultured cells. TMPRSS2 knockout mice showed no developmental, physiological, or pathological changes from wild-type mice. accumulated evidence has revealed that TMPRSS2 acts as an activating protease for a broad range of respiratory viruses."}
