{"summary": "the frequency of respiratory viral infection in patients with pulmonary acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is not uncommon, but clinical significance remains to be further elucidated. the purpose of this study was to compare characteristics and outcomes of patients with pulmonary ARDS infected with respiratory viruses. influenza viral infection in pulmonary ARDS has gained attention to intensivists. but little data comparing characteristics and outcomes of patients with pulmonary ARDS. data from laboratory (neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, hemoglobin, platelet, C-reactive protein [CRP] level, total protein level, albumin level, etc.) and clinical outcomes (length of stay in ICU and hospital, mortality) were analyzed. ngeal swab or sputum were obtained for RT-PCR analysis. data from laboratory (neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, hemoglobin, platelet, C-reactive protein [CRP] level, total protein level, albumin level, etc.) were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. one hundred sixty-seven patients with pulmonary ARDS were admitted to the medical ICU. one hundred and twenty-six patients with pulmonary ARDS (75.4%) underwent multiplex RT-PCR. sex 41 (70.7) 19 (67.9) 22 (73.3) 0.647 BMI, kg/m2 23.14.3 23.93.8 22.34.6 0.286 DM 19 (32.8) 11 (39.3) 8 (26.7) 0.306 CHF 4 (6.9) 2 (7.1) 2 (6.7) >0.999 CKD 6 (10.3) 1 (3.6) 5 (16.7) 0.195 CLD 7 (12.1) 6 (21.4) 1 (3.3) 0.048 CVD 11 (19) 5 there was a trend toward higher hemoglobin and CRP levels in patients with influenza and those with other viruses. there was a trend toward higher hemoglobin and CRP levels in patients with influenza and those with other viruses. influenza was the most common virus (21 cases) and other respiratory virus infection (10 coronavirus, 5 RSV, 4 parainfluenza virus, 4 rhinovirus, 3 adenovirus, 3 metapneumovirus, and 1 bocavirus) co-infection was common in patients with influenza virus (39.3% vs. 10%) patients with influenza virus were treated with neuraminidase inhibitor such as oseltamivir or peramivir. overall ICU mortality and hospital mortality rates were 51.7% and 55.2% respectively.

ARDS is a common reason of admission to the ICU in critically ill patients. pulmonary ARDS has been known as the most common etiology of pulmonary ARDS13. the co-infection of respiratory virus was found in patients with severe pneumonia admitted to ICU ranging from 13.4% to 49%3,4,5. current study is consistent with previous studies that influenza virus infection was commonly complicated with co-infection by bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae22,23. this supports the use of empirical antibiotics in cases of ARDS infected with influenza virus."}
