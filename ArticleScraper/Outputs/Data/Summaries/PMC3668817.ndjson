{"summary": "viral latency, high rates of mutation during viral replication, and emergence of drug-resistant strains pose problems for highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) despite the ongoing development of newer drugs (1\u20133) an effective vaccine against HIV-1 remains a top priority in the fight against this pandemic virus. PD-L1 is constitutively expressed on T cells, B cells, macrophages, and DCs. PD-L2 is found on DCs and activated monocytes and macrophages (19, 20) blockade of the PD1/PD-L pathway using anti-PD1 antibody or a soluble form of PD1 (sPD1) that contains only the extracellular domain rescues exhausted T cell responses. sPD1-based DNA/EP vaccination strategy is uniquely immunogenic in its ability to induce high frequencies of durable, polyfunctional, cytotoxic, and protective CD8+ T cells. the rabbit Fc helps protein detection and purification but does not contain its receptor-binding domain (FcR) all constructs contain a tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) signal sequence. rabbit Fc was used as a tag for purification and detection purposes. upper and lower blots show proteins detected by anti-HIV GAG or anti-rabbit Fc antibody. 3 vaccinations with sPD1-p24fc/EP were essential for eliciting stronger p24-specific T cell responses. increased splenocytes (greater than 2-fold) against the H2-Kd\u2013restricted CD8 epitope GAG A-I (approximately 900 spot-forming units [SFUs] per 106 cells; Figure 2B) mice were immunized with sPD1-p24fc, sPD1-p24fc, and p24fc at a dose of 20 g DNA delivered via i.m./EP. mice were sacrificed 2 weeks after each immunization to collect spleen and blood for analysis of cellular and humoral immune responses. sPD1-p24fc/EP vaccination performed immunization using a 100-g dose of DNA following the same immunization schedule. compared with the 20-g dose, we found a 2-fold increase in both CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses. we also found a greater than 10-fold increase in IgG1 and IgG2a antibody responses. more than 13% and 22% of CD8+ T cells in the spleen were positive for H2-Kd-GAG A-I tetramer binding in the 20-g and 100-g sPD1-p24fc dose groups of BALB/c mice. sPD1-p24fc/EP DNA vaccination elicited robust CD8+ T cell immunity with extended epitopic breadth of p24 specificity. IFN-producing CD8+ and (B) CD4+ cells were measured by ELISPOT assay. IgG1 (Th2) was tested in both strains of mice. IgG2a was detected in both strains of mice. CFSE signals on CD8+ T cell populations were detected by flow cytometry. sPD1-p24fc/EP vaccination elicited substantially higher frequencies of p24-specific IFN-+CD8+ T cells. the frequencies of p24-specific CD4+ T cells producing either IFN- alone (21.0%), dual IFN-/TNF- (22.3%), or triple IFN-/TNF-/IL-2 (4.7%) were elevated as well with the sPD1-p24fc/EP vaccination. column graphs depicting subpopulations of single-, double-, or triple-positive CD8+ or (C) CD4+ T cells releasing the cytokines IFN-, TNF-, and/or IL-2 induced by DNA vaccination of sPD1-p24fc and sPD1-p24fc. column graphs represent the mean values of 2 independent experiments with 3 mice per group. total splenocytes isolated from sPD1-p24fc/EP\u2013immunized mice showed stronger target cell killing effects. a high percentage of dead target cells was detected after coculture with CD8+ T cells from sPD1-p24fc/EP\u2013immunized mice. to our surprise, purified CD4+ T cells after sPD1-p24fc/EP showed cytotoxic function starting from a 1:1 ratio. virulent vaccinia Western Reserve strain expressing HIV-1 gagpol (WRgagpol) challenged mice immunized with a 100-g DNA vaccine. mice immunized with sPD1-p24fc/EP showed greater than 25% body weight loss within 8 days. FUs WRgagpol weighed daily for 8 days after immunization. mice were sacrificed on day 8 and virus titers in the lungs were evaluated. data represent the SEM of 2 independent experiments with 5 mice per group. the EP/no-fusion group induced levels of T cell (IFN-+CD8+ or IFN-+CD4+) and antibody responses comparable to those in mice vaccinated with rabbit Fc-containing counterparts in group 1. the fusion DNA construct of sPD1-p24fc is essential and is the best strategy for eliciting greatly enhanced CD8+ T cell and antibody responses. sPD1-p24fc/EP is more effective than anti\u2013DEC205-p24/EP at enhancing CD8+ T cell immunity. sPD1-p24fc/EP is more effective than anti\u2013DEC205-p24/EP at enhancing CD8+ T cell immunity. anti-DEC205 antibody has been previously used to develop DC-targeting vaccines (15, 16) sPD1-p24fc/EP and anti\u2013DEC205-p41/EP were similar for both IgG1 and IgG2a. statistically significantly higher frequencies of CD8+ T cells were evident with sPD1-p24fc/EP than with anti\u2013DEC205-p41/EP across 4 subpopulations. sPD1-p24fc/EP vaccination uniquely enhances IL-12\u2013producing DCs in vivo. sPD1-p24fc/EP vaccination uniquely enhances IL-12\u2013producing DCs in vivo. p24fc protein bound to splenic CD11c+ DCs in vitro at similar and much higher levels than did p24fc protein (Supplemental Figure 4A), indicating proper binding with their respective receptors. the detection of p24 antigen intracellularly after sPD1-p24fc or anti\u2013DEC205-p24 (12%) binding suggests that antigen uptake had taken place. no changes were found in PD-L1/L2 expression on DCs or PD1 expression on T cells in vivo. the frequency of IL-12\u2013producing CD11c+ DCs was found to be significantly higher in the sPD1-p24fc/EP group than in the anti\u2013DEC205-p41/EP or p24fc/EP groups. sPD1-p24fc/EP displayed a unique advantage in the activation of IL-12\u2013 splenic lymph node CD11c+ DCs were treated with the proteins sPD1-p24, anti\u2013DEC205-p24, or p24 for 15 minutes and 1 hour. sPD1-p24fc, but not anti\u2013DEC205-p41/EP, engages the antigen cross-presentation pathway in DCs. cross-presentation of exogenous antigen by DCs can drive the subsequent CD8+ T cell response independent of CD4+ T cell help (49, 50) it has been documented that cross-presentation of exogenous antigen by DCs can drive the subsequent CD8+ T cell response independent of CD4+ T cell help (49, 50) sPD1-p24 uniquely used the cross-presenting MHC class I (Rab14) endosome compartments that likely underlie the enhanced CD8+ T cell response following vaccination. sPD1-p24fc, sPD1-p24fc, and sPD1-p24fc were designed and generated to test our working hypothesis. constructs encompassing soluble form of PD1 (sPD1) or with 2 amino acid deletions essential for binding with PD-L1/L2 (sPD1), p24, and rabbit Fc under the CMV promoter. all constructs contain a tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) signal sequence. 3 vaccinations with sPD1-p24fc/EP were essential for eliciting stronger p24-specific T cell responses. increased splenocytes against the H2-Kd\u2013restricted CD8 epitope GAG A-I. p24-specific CD8+ T cell responses were consistently more than 10-fold higher than those of CD4+ T cells among all animals tested. p24-specific memory CD4+ T cells and enhanced IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies against HIV-1 p24 in sera detected by ELISA. mice were sacrificed 2 weeks after the last immunization to collect spleen and blood for analysis of cellular and humoral immune responses. we performed immunization using a 100-g dose of DNA following the same immunization schedule. compared with the 20-g dose, we found a 2-fold increase in CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses in immunized mice 2 weeks after the last vaccination. ELISPOTs per 106 splenocytes were detected with p24 pool 3. the variable levels of responses to p24 pools 1 and 2 were probably due to the genetic differences between BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice. more than 13% and 22% of CD8+ T cells in the spleen were positive for H2-Kd-GAG A-I tetramer binding. sPD1-p24fc, sPD1-p24fc, and p24fc were administered to BALB/c mice at a dose of 100 g DNA i.m/EP. IFN-\u2013producing CD8+ and (B) CD4+ cells were measured by ELISPOT assay in splenocytes stimulated using the specific peptides GAG A-I and GAG 26 respectively. CFSE signals on CD8+ T cell populations were detected by flow cytometry. sPD1-p24fc/EP vaccination elicited substantially higher frequencies of p24-specific IFN-+CD8+ T cells. cells with up to 47.1% of total splenic CD8+ cells produced either IFN- alone (21.0%), dual IFN-/TNF- (22.3%), or triple IFN-/TNF-/IL-2 (4.7%) were elevated as well with the sPD1-p24fc/EP vaccination. column graphs depicting subpopulations of single-, double-, or triple-positive CD8+ or (C) CD4+ T cells releasing the cytokines IFN-, TNF-, and/or IL-2 induced by DNA vaccination of sPD1-p24fc and sPD1-p24fc. line graphs show percentages of dead cells as a result of cell-mediated killing. total splenocytes isolated from sPD1-p24fc/EP\u2013immunized mice showed stronger target cell killing effects. a high percentage of dead target cells was detected after coculture with CD8+ T cells from sPD1-p24fc/EP\u2013immunized mice. to investigate whether cellular immunity elicited by sPD1-p24fc/EP leads to protection, groups of BALB/c mice were first challenged intrana virulent vaccinia Western Reserve strain expressing HIV-1 gagpol (WRgagpol) challenged mice immunized with a 100-g DNA vaccine. mice immunized with sPD1-p24fc/EP showed greater than 25% body weight loss within 8 days. with 100-g DNA vaccines were challenged with 2 106 PFUs WRgagpol three weeks after immunization. mice were sacrificed on day 8 and virus titers in the lungs were evaluated. data represent the SEM of 2 independent experiments with 5 mice per group. the EP/no-fusion group elicited noticeably less T cell (IFN-+CD8+ or IFN-+CD4+) and IgG2a antibody responses than group 1. the fusion protein was necessary for effective DC targeting. sPD1-p24fc is the best strategy for eliciting greatly enhanced CD8+ T cell and antibody responses. sPD1-p24fc/EP is more effective than anti\u2013DEC205-p24/EP at enhancing CD8+ T cell immunity. sPD1-p24fc/EP is more effective than anti\u2013DEC205-p24/EP at enhancing CD8+ T cell immunity. anti-DEC205 antibody has been previously used to develop DC-targeting vaccines (15, 16) sPD1-p24fc/EP and anti\u2013DEC205-p41/EP were similar for both IgG1 and IgG2a. statistically significantly higher frequencies of CD8+ T cells were evident with sPD1-p24fc/EP than with anti\u2013DEC205-p41/EP across 4 subpopulations. splenocytes stimulated with the specific epitopes GAG A-I and GAG 26 respectively. splenocytes stimulated with the specific epitopes GAG A-I and GAG 26. splenocytes stimulated with the specific epitopes GAG A-I. both anti\u2013DEC205-p24 and sPD1-p24fc protein bound to splenic CD11c+ DCs in vitro at similar and much higher levels than did p24fc protein. the detection of p24 antigen intracellularly after sPD1-p24fc or anti\u2013DEC205-p24 (12%) binding suggests that antigen uptake had taken place. expression on CD11c+ DCs at 24 hours despite lack of statistical significance. for comparison, no changes were found in PD-L1/L2 expression on DCs or PD1 expression on T cells in vivo. further, we examined the production of Th1 cytokines IL-12 and IFN- by CD11c+ DCs (47). splenic CD11c+ DCs were treated with the proteins sPD1-p24, anti\u2013DEC205-p24, or p24 for 15 minutes and 1 hour. sPD1-p24fc, but not anti\u2013DEC205-p24, engages the antigen cross-presentation pathway in DCs. cross-presentation of exogenous antigen by DCs can drive subsequent CD8+ T cell response independent of CD4+ T cell help (49, 50) cross-presentation of exogenous antigen by DCs can drive the subsequent CD8+ T cell response independent of CD4+ T cell help (49, 50) sPD1-p24fc/EP DNA vaccination elicits remarkably enhanced cellular and humoral immune responses against HIV-1 GAG antigen. sPD1-based vaccination displays unique advantages when compared with anti-DEC205\u2013based DC targeting in its capacity to induce a higher frequency of IL-12\u2013producing DCs. sPD1-p24fc/EP DNA vaccination elicited approximately 900 SFUs per 106 splenocytes at the 20-g DNA dose. sPD1-p24fc/EP elicited approximately 900 SFUs per 106 splenocytes at the 20-g DNA dose. sPD1-p24fc/EP elicited approximately 900 SFUs per 106 splenocytes the 22% CD8+ GAG A-I tetramer\u2013positive T cell response elicited with the 100-g dose of sPD1-p24fc/EP was comparable to that obtained with rAd5-GAG vaccines in BALB/c mice immunized 3 times at a high dose of 1010 virus particles. up to 47.1% of total splenic CD8+ T cells were p24 specific and were releasing IFN-+ sPD1-p24fc/EP vaccination depends on the functionality of sPD1. sPD1-p24fc differs from sPD1-p24fc by 2 essential amino acids in the functional IgV domain of sPD1 (35, 36, 60) this renders the protein unable to interact with PD1 ligands expressed on either transfected cells or DCs. sPD1-p24fc/EP resulted in consistently higher levels of CD40, CD80, and MHC class II expression. sPD1-p24fc/EP resulted in consistently higher levels of CD40, CD80, and MHC class II expression. sPD1-p24fc/EP resulted in consistently higher levels of CD40, CD80, and MHC class II expression. sPD1-p24fc/EP and anti\u2013DEC205-p41/EP achieved comparable levels of antigen uptake (Supplemental Figure 5A), costimulatory molecule expression (Figure 8A), and a similar frequency of IFN-\u2013producing DCs (Figure 8D). a noticeably higher frequency of IL-12\u2013producing DCs was only detected with sPD1-p24fc/EP vaccination, suggesting that an IL-12\u2013mediated mechanism underlies the increase the coding sequence for the extracellular domain of murine PD1 (sPD1) was obtained by nested PCR from mouse cDNA. a linker GGGGSGGGG (nt sequence: GGTGGTGTCAGGAGGAGGA) was applied between the sPD1 and HIV1 p24 gene. sPD1 does not react with PD1 ligands due to an in-frame deletion of 2 essential amino acids in the IgV domain. 293T cells (106 cells) transiently expressing PD-L1 and PD-L2 were incubated with 2 g of purified sPD1-p24fc, sPD1-p24fc, or p24fc fusion protein. FITC-rat anti-mouse PD-L1 or PD-L2 antibodies (eBioscience) and FITC-rat IgG1 isotype served as positive and negative controls va and splenocytes were collected for immune response analysis. two weeks after each immunization, mice were sacrificed. splenocytes were collected for immune response analysis. cells stimulated with 500 ng/ml phorbol 12-mystrate 13-acetate (PMA; Sigma-Aldrich) plus 1 g/ml calcium ionocycin. cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 and 100% humidity for 20 hours. splenocytes were stimulated with an HIV-1 p24 peptide pool. BM-DCs from BALB/c mice were obtained from bone marrow extracts. cells were cultured with CD3-APC/Cy7, CD4-PE/Cy5, CD8-PerCP/Cy5.5 antibodies. retrovirus-containing supernatants were collected and used to infect AB1 cells followed by puromycin selection. purified CD4+ and CD8+ T cells isolated from vaccinated mice were cocultured for 2 hours at 37\u00b0C then analyzed for the percentage of dead target cells in total AB1-HIV-1-GAG cell populations. vaccinia WR strain was purchased from ATCC (ATCC VR-1354) and propagated in vero cells. the virus was modified to express HIV-1 gag and pol genes in place of the hemagglutinin gene. groups of animals were sacrificed 3 days or 8 days after challenge by VTTgagpol or WRgagpol, respectively, to measure viral titers in their lungs. CD11c+ splenic DCs (1 106) were treated with purified sPD1-p24fc or anti\u2013DEC205-p24, p24fc proteins for 20 minutes at room temperature. FITC-rat anti-mouse PD-L1 or PD-L2 antibodies (eBioscience) were used to confirm the expression of PD1 ligands on the surface of DCs. DNA vaccines of sPD1-p24fc or sPD1-p24fc, anti\u2013DEC205-p41, and p24fc were administered i.m. with EP to mice at a 100-g dose. mice were sacrificed at 4, 8, 16, 24, and 72 hours after injection. cells were stained with surface antibodies: anti-CD11c-APC/Cy7; anti-MHC II-PE; anti\u2013CD80-APC; anti\u2013 the next day, 2 106 CFSE-labeled OT-I or OT-II T cells were adoptively transferred into B6 mice by tail vein injection. draining lymph nodes were harvested and the extent of CFSE dilution determined among OT-I or OT-II T cells by flow cytometry. sPD1-p24fc, sPD1-p24fc, and p24fc on a background of pVAX1. the coding sequence for the extracellular domain of murine PD1 (sPD1) was obtained by nested PCR from mouse cDNA. sPD1 does not react with PD1 ligands due to an in-frame deletion of 2 essential amino acids in the IgV domain. all plasmids contained a rabbit Fc tag to facilitate protein purification and characterization. mouse immunization was approved by the Committee on the use of live animals in teaching and research at the laboratory animal unit of the university of Hong Kong. mice were housed in cages under standard conditions with regulated temperature and humidity, fed with pelted food and tap water, and cared for according to the criteria outlined in the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals. ten micrograms per milliliter of HIV-1 p24 peptide or peptide pools were used to stimulate splenocytes in vitro. splenocytes were stimulated with an HIV-1 p24 peptide pool (2 g/ml for each peptide) cells were washed and incubated with 2.4G2 mAb for 15 minutes at 4\u00b0C to block Fc. cells were permeabilized in 100 l of Fixation/Permeabilization solution (BD Biosciences) cells were then stained intracellularly with anti\u2013IFN--PE, anti\u2013IL-2-PE-Cy7, and anti\u2013TNF--FITC (eBiosciences) AB1 cells were bought from the European Collection of Cell Cultures. cells were cultured in RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, L-glutamine, and antibiotics. the cell line was maintained in vitro at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere. vaccinated mice were challenged intranasally by 4 107 PFUs of a modified vaccinia Tian Tan strain or 2 106 PFUs of the WR strain. the virus was modified to express HIV-1 gag and pol genes in place of the hemagglutinin gene. groups of animals were sacrificed 3 days or 8 days after challenge by VTTgagpol or WRgagpol. protein expression of these plasmids from transfected 293T cells was detected at similar levels by Western blot analysis. the DNAs psc-DEC-p41, psc-Cont-p41, sPD1-p24fc, and p24fc were used to immunize mice via i.m./EP at a dose of 100 g. the immune response analysis was the same as described above. goat anti-rabbit IgG stained with DCs cultured in medium only served as a negative control. 1 106 splenic CD11c+ DCs were cultured with 2 g of purified sPD1-p24fc or sPD1-p24fc. stained cells were permeabilized in 100 l of Fixation/Permeabilization solution (BD Biosciences) for 20 minutes at 4\u00b0C. stained intracellularly with FITC-conjugated mouse anti\u2013HIV-1 p24 antibody. sPD1-OVAfc and sPD1-OVAfc were replaced with ovalbumin. anti\u2013DEC205-p41 proteins at 37\u00b0C for 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, and 2 hours. cells were briefly centrifuged and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 40 minutes at room temperature. permeabilization using blocking buffer PBS with 5% FBS, 3% BSA, and 0.5% Triton X-100 was performed for 20 minutes at 4\u00b0C before incubation with primary antibodies against Rab5, Rab7, Rab9, Rab14, Lamp Supplementary Material Supplemental data JCI64704sd.pdf (823.3KB, pdf)."}
