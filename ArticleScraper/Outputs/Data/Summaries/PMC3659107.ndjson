{"summary": "bats were shown to be involved in several emergent viral diseases. bats serve as reservoirs of 10 of the 11 Lyssavirus species described. two new recently described tentative of the three novel Lyssavirus species further enlarged the genetic diversity of lyssaviruses found in bats. most EBLV-1\u2013positive European bats were identified during passive surveillance and diagnosed in the Serotine bat (Eptesicus serotinus) [14] few data are available on the infection incidence in other European bat species. the role of these species in EBLV-1 epidemiology, particularly Lyssavirus cross-species-infection dynamics, remains unknown. bat colonies were sampled throughout the year, avoiding hibernation and birthing periods. black circles indicate localities where seropositive bats or individuals with EBLV-1 RNA were found. black circles indicate previously sampled localities. blood samples (0.1\u20130.5 mL, depending on the bat's size) were obtained by a small puncture made in median artery. pressure with a sterile towel was applied to the wound until the bleeding stopped. a sterile absorbent sponge impregnated with gelatin was placed on the site. the bats were offered 10% glucose\u2013water orally to prevent dehydration. titers are expressed as the arithmetic means of two independent repetitions. RNA was extracted from individual blood clots and organs and tested by nested real-time polymerase chain reaction. negative controls were performed individually for each step and were negative. Statistical analyses analyzed the probability of being ELBV-1\u2013seropositive as a function of five explanatory variables: taxon, month, sex, colony size and species richness. the taxon variable included four families of bats sampled in Europe. we used a generalized linear-mixed model and assumed a binomial distribution to investigate relationships between EBLV-1 seroprevalence and the five explanatory variables. the 74 distinct sampling times were distributed over 16 localities and 10 years. all analyses were conducted using the R package version 2.14.2 [31]. models were run with the \u2018glmer\u2019 function in \u2018lme4\u2019. probability ratio tests between models were calculated using the R-function \u2018anova\u2019. insectivorous bats were captured inside the roosts with long-handled butterfly nets during the day or with mist nets at sunset. the latter nets were used only when access to the interior was not possible. individuals were sexed and aged as juveniles or adults based on the degree of epiphyseal fusion. serum samples and clot pellets were frozen at 20\u00b0C and \u201380\u00b0C respectively, before analysis. the 45 carcasses analyzed during the study were dead bats found during fieldwork or those that died during handling. none exhibited any symptoms associated with rabies. RNA was extracted from individual blood clots and organs and tested by nested real-time polymerase chain reaction (nRT-PCR) RNA was extracted from individual blood clots and organs, and tested by nested real-time polymerase chain reaction (nRT-PCR). negative controls were performed individually for each step (extraction, reverse transcription, first and second PCR) accurate colony-size estimates were only available for some localities. we categorized colonies not exceeding 100 individuals small, those harboring 100\u2013500 individuals medium and those home to 500 individuals large. for each sampling time, we also calculated the number of species (species-richness variable) present in the refuge that form clusters. analysis, we used 2,144 sera from 12 bat species. we excluded the few bats captured more than once within the same month. all models considered for analysis included the fixed additive effects of the five explanatory variables. 17 of the 25 localities harbored positive bats.

EBLV-1 seroprevalence was significantly higher in medium and large colonies than small colonies. bats living in medium (ORs = 1.96) or large colonies had nearly two and more than four times greater probability of being seropositive. in these cases, bats had more twice higher probability of being seropositive (ORs = 2.42) than in monospecific colonies. in these cases, bats had more twice higher probability of being seropositive (ORs = 2.42) than in monospecific colonies. 0.511 3 species 0.883 0.234 2.419 1.527\u20133.831 3.767 0.001 colony size Small* medium 0.674 0.214 1.962 1.289\u20132.896 3.146 0.002 large 1.506 0.209 4.501 2.994\u20136.786 7.214 0.001 random effects 2 error locality 0.000 0.000 year 1.344 1.159 * Reference. the model that includes the variable sex was not better than the best model. sex-ratio changes observed during the year did not influence EBLV-1 seroprevalence. this variability might be explained by different susceptibilities to infection. rabies virus (RABV) seroprevalence in common vampire bats was independent of bat-colony size. multispecies, large colonies, especially those with three or more different bat species, had a higher probability of EBLV-1 infection. colony size alone could not explain all the variability observed. cross et al [54] showed that the probability of a pandemic event depended on the interaction between colony size and movement of groups. they suggested that large groups and frequent movements were more heavily impacted by acute diseases than hosts with small groups and infrequent movement. this could explain the high EBLV-1 seroprevalence observed in large multispecific colonies comprising M. schreibersii and, sometimes, M. capaccinii, both species being considered regionally migratory [15 the integration of ecology and epidemiology is a relatively new area of research. the results provide a number of novel insights and improve our understanding of complex multi-host epidemiological systems for bat lyssaviruses."}
