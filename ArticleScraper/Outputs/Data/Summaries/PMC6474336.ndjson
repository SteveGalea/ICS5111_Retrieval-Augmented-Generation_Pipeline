{"summary": "BLAST was used to identify the sequence of tyrosine decarboxylase in the transcriptome of Lycoris aurea (L\u2019H\u00e9r) Herb. the related productive contents of tyramine were detected using high performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) the expression levels of miR396 and LaTYDC1 were measured using a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) plants generate and accumulate secondary metabolites in response to a wide variety of biotic and abiotic stresses. these secondary metabolites have developed as resources of natural drugs because of their biological activities. many others have become commercially important and beneficial in the treatment of human diseases. TYDC is the first committed step in isoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis. tyrosine is converted into tyramine by an undefined tyrosine decarboxylase. TYDC is involved in the proposed biosynthetic pathway for galanthamine. methyl jasmonate (MeJA) signal regulates plant response to many biotic and abiotic stresses by coordinating production of abundant of defense-related protein and secondary metabolites. microRNAs (miRNAs) are commonly found in both plants and animals, these small regulatory RNAs with 20\u201324 nucleotides have been recognized for their participation. 154 miRNAs expressing differently in comparison to vehicle-treated ones were identified. 32 genes from different plant processes were validated and then targeted by 49 miRNAs. we found that miR396 regulates expression level of transcriptional factors. each treated sample was collected for further analyses. total RNA extraction, cDNA first-strand synthesis and qRT-PCR 100 mg of fresh tissue were fully ground in liquid nitrogen and 1 ml RNAiso was added following the RNA extraction protocol described in the instructions (Takara, Dalian, China) real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR was performed using qTPWER (Analytik Jena, Jena, Germany) the L. aurea U6 gene was used for normalization. each qPCR was repeated three times. expressing cells were observed under an LSM 780 confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) with the 488 nm excitation and 505\u2013530 nm band-pass emission filter. expression and purification of recombinant LaTYDC1 Heterologous expression and protein purification were carried out as described by Zhang et al. (2011) with some modification. fusion protein was eluted by elution buffer, which contains 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 0.01 M reduced glutathione. catalytic activity of the purified GST-LaTYCD1 protein followed the method of lehmann & Pollmann (2009). the injection volume was 10 L, and dopamine was detected at 275 nm. determination of tyramine in plants by HPLC Fresh plant materials were weighted. NnTYDC2 (Nelumbo nucifera, XP_010245171.1); QsTYDC1 (Quercus suber, SXP_023871760.1); AcTYDC (Aristolochia contorta, DQ986331.1); AcTYDC (Ananas comosus, PKA66030.1); JrTYDC1 (Rosa chinensis, XP_024161133.1 Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 13.0. differences were analyzed with one-way ANOVA test or t-test. qRT-PCR program started at 95 \u00b0C for 5 min, then took place in a condition of 95 \u00b0C for 15 s, 56 \u00b0C for 15 s, 72 \u00b0C for 20 s, for 40 cycles. qRT-PCR protocol was as follows: 95 \u00b0C for 30 s, 40 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 5 s, 56 \u00b0C for 15 s, 72 \u00b0C for 20 s. the ligation of 5\u2032 RACE adapter and oligo RNA were performed following the manual of the kit. by using the 5\u2032 RACE outer or inner primer, nested PCR was performed. the PCR products were purified and cloned into pGEM-T vector. isopropyl thio-b-D-galactopyranoside (IPTG) at a final concentration of 0.5 mM was added. cells were harvested by centrifugation (4,000 rpm) for 10 min, suspended in 10 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) then sonicated on ice for 30 min. to measure tyramine, the solvent composition was: mobile phase A, water with 0.1% phosphoric acid; mobile phase B, 100% acetonitrile. the injection volume was 10 L, and tyramine was detected at 275 nm. the eluent gradient was: 5% B for 15 min, then the eluent from 5% B to 100% B in 5 min, kept for 10 min, then from 100% B to 5% B in 5 min, kept for 10 min, 0.8 mL/min flow rate. the injection volume was 10 L, and tyramine was detected at 275 nm. results MeJA treatment resulted in more tyramine accumulation in L. aurea plants. the control sample accumulate 19.32 mol g1 tyramine in the roots. the content of tyramine in root was 30.31 mol g1, almost two-folds the amount in the control samples. after 24 h, the content of tyramine in root was 7.7 mol g1. the accumulation of LaTYDC1 increased almost 200 folds after 100 M MeJA treatment. similar results were observed after 24 h treatment. laTYDC1 was fused with a 26.8 kDa GST tag in E. coli BL21. fusion protein showed a predictable molecular weight (MW) of 83.5 kDa. the optimal temperature for laTYDC1 enzyme activity is 50 \u00b0C. when the pH value is above 55 \u00b0C, enzyme activity rapidly declines. the substrate affinity was determined by calculating the Km we used tyrosine and 3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine (Dopa) as the substrate for LaTYDC1. miR396 is responsive to MeJA treatment, and the predicted target is LaTYDC1. qRT-PCR were used to determine the expression level of miR396 in different tissues. miR396 was the lowest in roots, and was mainly expressed in leaves. the expression in plants without MeJA was used as a reference of basal expression level. Statistical difference was estimated using the Least Significant Difference test compared with the 0 h control. the content of tyramine in root under MeJA treatment decreased to 7.7 mol g1 almost one half of the control samples. the seedlings were treated with 100 M MeJA for 6, 12 and 24 h. accumulation of laTYDC1 increased almost 200 folds after 24 h treatment. similar results were observed after 24 h treatment. the laTYDC1-GST fusion protein was fused with a 26.8 kDa GST tag in E. coli BL21. the fusion protein showed a predictable molecular weight (MW) of 83.5 kDa. the optimal temperature for laTYDC1 enzyme activity is 50 \u00b0C. when the temperature is below 30 \u00b0C or above 55 \u00b0C, enzyme activity rapidly declines. the optimum pH of laTYDC1 is 8.5; when the pH value is above 9, enzyme activity sharply declines. miR396 is responsive to MeJA treatment, and the predicted target is LaTYDC1. qRT-PCR were used to determine the expression level of miR396 in different tissues. the expression of miR396 was the lowest in roots, and was mainly expressed in leaves. expression in plants without MeJA was used as a reference of basal expression level. difference is significant with p value 0.01(**) and p-value =0.006 at 24 h. aromatic amino acid tyrosine is converted to tyramine by TYDC. TYDCs use tyrosine and dopa as substrates, but are not able to catalyze L-phenylalanine. TYDCs use tyrosine and dopa as substrates. laTYDC1 could convert tyrosine to tyramine and have a higher substrate specificity for tyrosine over dopa. in previous reports, when the gene RsTYDC was overexpressed, the content of tyramine and salidroside in transgenic seedlings was higher than in the wild type. the expression of miR396 was elevated to a higher level as the control. however, with the treatment alone, the expression of miR396 was decreased to only one half of the 6-h treatment samples. in arabidopsis, seven of the GRFs contain the cleavage sites recognized by miR396. the phenomenon that RLM-RACE mapped the cleavage sites beyond the predicted target region was also observed for other miRNAs. it is likely that these fragments that result from miRNA cleavage are very susceptible to degradation induced by RNA decay proteins.
