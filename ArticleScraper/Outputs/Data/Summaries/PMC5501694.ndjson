{"summary": "MERS-CoV caused global pandemics in 2003[1] and 2012[2]. outbreak of MERS-CoV in the Republic of Korea highlighted the newly emerged CoVs remain a major concern for the public health. effective vaccine and drug against CoVs are still missing. nsps encode two replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab. nsps assemble into membrane-associated replication-transcription complexes. helicases unwind DNA or RNA duplexes in an NTP hydrolysis dependent manner. nidovirus helicases share many structural features with the eukaryotic Upf1 helicase, a key factor in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay in cells[24,25]. nidovirus helicases share many structural features with the eukaryotic Upf1 helicase, a key factor in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay in cells[24,25]. coV helicase is one of the three evolutionary most conserved proteins in nidoviruses[27], thus making it an important target for drug development[28]. nsp13 exhibits multiple enzymatic activities, including hydrolysis of NTPs and dNTPs, unwinding of DNA and RNA duplexes with 5\u2019-3\u2019 directionality. a335V mutation in the helicase core of nsp13 causes the attenuation of MHV replication both in vitro and in vivo. despite extensive efforts, three-dimensional structural characterization of nsp13 remained absent. helicase assay shows that MERS-CoV nsp13 can unwind RNA partial duplex with 5\u2019 overhang, but cannot unwind RNA partial duplex with 3\u2019 overhang. helicase assay shows that MERS-CoV nsp13 can unwind RNA partial duplex with 5\u2019 overhang. helicase assay showing MERS-CoV nsp13 can utilize different NTPs and dNTP to separate RNA strands with a preference to ATP. incubation with a 5\u2019-triphosphate-15T DNA (ppp-15T) greatly improved diffracting power of nsp13 crystals. 90.00 120.00 90.00 90.00 120.00 X ray source SLS X06DA SSRF BL19U1 Wavelength (Peak) 1.2831 (Infl) 1.2810 (Hrem) 0.9784 (native) Data range () 49.06\u20133.12 49.09\u20133.12 49.05\u20133.12 48.95\u20133.00 Reflections unique 63859 64027 63771 71207 Rsym a (last shell) 0.29 Ihkl is the average of symmetry-related observations of a unique reflection b Rwork = hkl ||Fobs(hkl)|-|Fcalc(hkl)|/hkl|Fobs(hkl)|. d 100th percentile is the best among structures of comparable resolution. structural superposition showed that while the helicase portion of these three proteins aligns well, the N-terminal CH (or ZBD) and 1B domains adopt various conformations relative to the helicase core. Fig 2. Overall structure of MERS-CoV nsp13. secondary structure elements or subdomains of MERS-CoV nsp13 are labeled with regular font, secondary structure elements of EAV nsp10 and Upf1 helicase are labeled with regular font. three zinc atoms of each CH domain are indicated (italic fonts) the CH domain of MERS-CoV nsp13 (residues 1\u2013112) is a compact domain with three zinc-binding motifs stabilizing the fold. the CH domain contains an N-terminal RING-like module (1-46aa, 1\u20135 and 1) with two zinc fingers and C-terminal RING-like module with single treble-clef zinc finger. nuckle on a hairpin loop between 5 and 6 strands provides Cys50 and Cys55 for Zn3 coordination. Cys72 from the C-terminal region of 7 strand and His75 from the loop between 7 and 8 strands provide two more ligands for the zinc. all Cys/His involved in zinc coordination are invariant in CoVs. the interaction between the CH domain and the helicase region is significantly different between nidovirus helicases and Upf1. however, the interaction between the CH domain and the helicase region is significantly different between nidovirus helicases and upf1 and similar between nidovirus helicases. vs Upf1 20.9 3.6 nsp13: MERS-CoV nsp13, (B) EAV nsp10-DNA PDB ID: 4N0O, (C) Yeast Upf1-RNA PDB ID: 2XZL and (D) Human Upf1 without RNA PDB ID: 2WJV colored by different functional domains. two hydrophobic pockets on surface of nsp13 CH equivalent to upf2 RecA2 (444-596aa) has a five-stranded parallel -sheet surrounded by four helices on one side and three helices on the opposite side. RecA1 contains motifs I, Ia, II and III, whereas RecA2 includes motifs IV, V and VI. sulfate, crystallization condition precipitant, was found bound to the P-loop mimicking binding of the phosphate moiety. model of nsp13-ssRNA was generated based on the superposition of the helicase domain of nsp13 with the helicase domains of hUpf1, scUpf1[26] and EAV nsp10[25]. model shows that while the 3\u2019 end of single-stranded RNA is located in the channel formed by 1B, Stalk and RecA1 domains. helicase domain on nsp13 with helicase domains of human Upf1-RNA (PDB ID: 2XZO, orange), yeast Upf1-RNA (PDB ID: 2XZL, red) and EAV -DNA (PDB ID: 4N0O, yellow) surface and electrostatic potentials of the recombinant protein are indicated. helicase activity of recombinant MERS-CoV nsp13 is dependent on ATP hydrolysis. MERS-CoV nsp13 hydrolyzed different NTPs and dNTPs to support unwinding of RNA substrate. helicase assay showing MERS-CoV nsp13 can utilize different NTPs and dNTP to separate RNA strands with a preference to ATP. incubation with a 5\u2019-triphosphate-15T DNA (ppp-15T) greatly improved diffracting power of nsp13 crystals.

Domain composition of Upf1-related helicases. RecA2 (444-596aa) has a five-stranded parallel -sheet surrounded by four helices on one side and three helices on the opposite side. seven helicase motifs conserved in SF1/SF2 families are located in the cleft between RecA1-RecA2. model of nsp13-ssRNA based on the superposition of the helicase domain of nsp13 with the helicase domains of hUpf1, scUpf1[26] and EAV nsp10[25]. model shows that while the 3\u2019 end of single-stranded RNA is located in the channel formed by 1B, Stalk and RecA1 domains; the 5\u2019 end of the RNA lies on top of RecA2 domain RNA complex was generated based on the superimposition of the helicase domain on nsp13 with helicase domains of human Upf1-RNA (PDB ID: 2XZO, orange), yeast Upf1-RNA (PDB ID: 2XZL, red) and EAV -DNA (PDB ID: 4N0O, yellow) the functional domains and the putative nucleic acids binding channel are indicated. coVs nsp13 does not contain a C-terminal domain homologous to the C-terminal portion of EAV nsp10 (C-terminal 65 residues) the sequence conservation analysis showed that the C-terminal domain of arteriviruses and CoVs is indeed poorly conserved[25]. previous mutagenesis studies of nsp13 have identified a collection of residues essential to the activity of nsp13. s/His substitutes can be attributed to the disruption of zinc-binding and the integrity of the CH domain. Zn3 is the most distantly located zinc from the helicase core. our current study presents the first structural insight into the multiple functionality of the coV nsp13. the structure of the individual domains of nsp13 is closely related to their eukaryotic equivalents in Upf1 helicase. the high resemblance between the CH domains of MERS-CoV nsp13 and Upf1 helicases is remarkable. nsp13 protein was overexpressed in high-5 insect cells using baculovirus. cells were harvested by centrifugation. nsp13 was purified using size-exclusion chromatography. crystallization of nsp13 protein was achieved by mixing equal volume of sample and reservoir buffer (1.0l) nsp13 protein was grown in a hanging-drop vapor-diffusion system at 18\u00b0C. oligonucleotide synthesis was synthesized and purified according to previously published procedures. highly redundant multi-wavelength anomalous diffraction data were collected using the X-ray with wavelengths close to the absorption edge of zinc. crystal belonged to the space group P6122, and contained two molecules per ASU. the plates were dried and analyzed using storage phosphor screen and Typhoon Trio Variable Mode Imager (GE healthcare).
