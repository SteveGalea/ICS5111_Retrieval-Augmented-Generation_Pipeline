{"summary": "the coalescent model (4) allows the joint estimation of dated evolutionary trees and the underlying parameters of the mutational model for all genes for which sequence data are available. the authors reexamine three key lineages of the hemagglutinin gene by drawing on recent extensions to the coalescent model that allow the average rate of evolution to vary within the same tree for viral populations assumed to be circulating. neuraminidase and internal genes were circulating in humans for 10 y or more before the start of the pandemic. the same robust analysis of the neuraminidase and internal genes indicates that these genes jumped to humans from wild birds and poultry just before 1918. the authors mention two immunological mechanisms that have been used to link the seroepidemiology of influenza and age-specific case incidence in previous studies. t al. refine antigenic imprinting to suggest a mechanism that can act for individual surface proteins. an individual born in 1969 would have some of the lifelong protection from severe disease during future pandemics with an H3 HA and some to pandemics with an N2 NA. but there are interesting data that are not consistent with it being a strong driver of population-level severity. the combination of NA and internal genes that jumped from birds must have had such a substantial impact on fitness. the strain was able to cause a pandemic, despite 10 y prior exposure to the usually dominant antigenic sites."}
