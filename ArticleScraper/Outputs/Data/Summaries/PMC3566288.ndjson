{"summary": "hygromycin (100 g/mL) and G418 (100 g/mL) were cultured using standard techniques. a clone stably expressing FLAGIFITM1 and another expressing empty pRev vector were selected and maintained by selection in hygromycin (100 g/mL) rabbit and mouse antioccludin (HECD1; Abcam, Cambridge, NY); antiCD81 (mouse JS81; BD Pharminogen, San Diego, CA); and mouse antiHCV NS5a 9E10 (a gift from C. Rice). a Huh7 clone stably expressing FLAGIFITM1 and another expressing empty pRev vector were selected and maintained by selection. mouse antiIFITM1 (Proteintech, Chicago, IL); rabbit antiIFITM1 (FL125; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma); rabbit and mouse anti\u2013ZO1, rabbit anti\u2013claudin1, and rabbit antioccludin (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY); antiCD81 (mouse JS81, BD Pharminogen, San Diego, CA; rabbit H121 and mouse 5A6, Santa Cruz Bio ribavirin therapy followed by those with early virologic responses. nonresponders were patients in which HCV serum RNA dropped by less than 2 log10 IU/mL by week 12 of therapy. IFITM2 and IFITM3 are family members of IFITM1. qRTPCR was used to compare IFITM1 levels before and after therapy. we knocked down IFITM1 expression by stably expressing an shRNA that targets IFITM1. in the absence of IFN, the knockdown of IFITM1 expression had no effect on HCV infection. clonal Huh7 cells stably harboring an HCV subgenomic replicon did not exclude viral protein expression. IFITM1 expression is fourfold higher than in Huh7 cells treated with 100 IU/mL IFN. the effect of IFITM1 was not due to defects in a single clone of IFITM1expresing Huh7 cells. a bulk population of Huh7IFITM1 also demonstrates reduced HCV protein accumulation. IFITM1 (Huh7IFITM1) or vector control (Huh7vector) were infected with HCV (MOI = 0.1) and tested for HCV copy number (via qRTPCR) (B) and HCV protein levels (determined via immunoblot assay with antiHCV NS5a and antiHCV patient serum) (C) SV and MLV pseudoparticles were not significantly reduced in the presence of IFITM1. the effect is not as strong as expected by the earlier reduction of HCV infection itself. Huh7IFITM1 and Huh7vector were bound with HCV at 4\u00b0C for 1 hour. cells were harvested for RNA to assess binding (B) or shifted to 37\u00b0C for 5 hours, followed by proteinase K cleavage of external virus. total cell lysates from Huh7IFITM1 and control cells were immunoprecipitated as indicated. mock and IFN\u2013treated Huh7 cells harboring nontargeting vector (NTV) or IFITM1specific shRNA (shIFITM1) were immunoprecipitated with antiCD81. d cells resulted in increased association of CD81 with occludin. IFITM1 expression stimulates CD81 redistribution and a stable association between CD81 and occludin during the IFN response. liver tissue from chronically infected patients treated with IFN for 24 hours was costained for IFITM1 (green) and ZO1 (red) samples were visualized using confocal microscopy. IFITM1 was identified as a potential antiHCV effector molecule. we validated the enhanced induction of IFITM1 by consensus IFN compared with IFN2a via immunoblot analysis. high levels of IFITM1 induction in liver tissue from chronically infected patients correlated strongly with favorable therapeutic outcome of viral load suppression. IFITM1 protein expression was detected via immunoblot assay. RNA was harvested from patients 24 hours after IFN therapy. patients were categorized as rapid virologic responders. IFITM1 has antiviral activity and contributes to global antiviral IFN response during HCV infection. extracts of cells treated with or without 50 U/mL IFN were probed for IFITM1 expression. clonal Huh7 cells stably harboring an HCV subgenomic replicon did not exclude viral protein expression. the effect of IFITM1 was not due to defects in a single clone of IFITM1expresing Huh7 cells. fewer cells were infected per focus compared with those in vectorcontrol samples. Huh7 cells stably harboring the K2040 HCV subgenomic replicon were transiently transfected with FLAGtagged IFITM1 followed by HCV infection (MOI = 1). images were captured at 60 magnification. a recent report identified IFITM1 as a restriction factor of HCV replication but not viral entry. the primary effect is upstream at the level of binding and/or entry due to the lack of inhibition of HCV replicon. HCV entry was blocked by ectopic IFITM1 expression to a level similar to the blockade imposed by antiCD81 antibody treatment. the reduction of HCV entry to levels corresponding to an antiCD81 control suggests that CD81dependent HCV entry is regulated by IFITM1. 7 cells by immunoprecipitation/immunoblot assay, as well as an association of IFITM1 with occludin, another required HCV coreceptor. we found that IFITM1 associates with the tight junction marker ZO1, but not adherens junction marker Ecadherin30,31. antiCD81 immunoprecipitation/immunoblot analyses in the presence or absence of ectopic IFITM1. expression of IFITM1 led to a redistribution of CD81 into occludincontaining complexes. IFITM1 promotes the association of CD81 with a complex associated with tight junctions in polarized cells. IFITM1 was distributed in liver tissue in a pattern consistent with hepatic tight junction localization and fully overlapped with the tight junction marker ZO1. liver tissue from chronically infected patients treated with IFN for 24 hours was costained for IFITM1 (green) and ZO1 (red) IFITM1 localizes to hepatic tight junctions following IFN treatment of uninfected chimeric mice or HCVinfected patients. the failure of the current therapy to achieve sustained viral inhibition drives the need for more effective and targeted treatments. IFITM1 is an important antiHCV effector ISG. these actions impart control of HCV by disrupting the assembly of HCV coreceptor complexes to suppress the HCV entry process. the viruses studied do not share major viral entry receptors with HCV. we propose that IFITM1 might in part affect HCV replication, but that the primary effect occurs at the level of viral entry, as in the case of other viruses studied. one could propose that IFITM1 alters complexes involved in tight junctions and may affect these other viruses. existing antiHCV therapies to increase sustained virologic response rates. supporting information Additional Supporting Information may be found in the online version of this article."}
