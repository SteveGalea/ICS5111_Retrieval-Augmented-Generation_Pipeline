{"summary": "many viral diseases have been eradicated, such as smallpox in 1979. shingles, genital herpes, chickenpox, infectious mononucleosis, up to herpes keratitis, neonatal disseminated infections, or viral encephalitis. but for some of today\u2019s most pressing viral pathogens, there is still no vaccine available. advances in antiviral therapy have led to the discovery and characterization of molecules required for viral replication and to the development of antiviral agents to inhibit them. most viruses are provided by an extraordinary genetic adaptability, which has enabled them to escape antiviral inhibition and in certain cases to regain advantage over the host. the entry inhibitor has been approved by the fda. this is enfuvirtide (T-20), a synthetic peptide that targets the HIV gp41 envelope protein to prevent fusion. the site of action of the inhibitor is likely to be extracellular and therefore relatively accessible. the use of nanoparticles can be extended to the development of antivirals that act by interfering with viral infection. nanoparticles are properly defined as particles with at least one dimension less than 100 nm. their singular physical (e.g., plasmonic resonance, fluorescent enhancement) and chemical (e.g., catalytic activity enhancement) properties derive from the high quantity of surface atoms. silver nanoparticles have been analysed and found to be extremely appealing. silver nanoparticles have been shown to be effective against a wide range of pathogens. antimicrobial activity of silver nanoparticles was shown to be effective mainly as antibacterial. low concentrations of silver nanoparticles were able to consistently inhibit E. coli [5] while the growth-inhibitory effect on S. aureus was minor. gold nanoparticles have been exploited as antimicrobial agents against fungal pathogens. metal nanoparticles can be effective antiviral agents against HIV-1 [37,38,39,40], hepatitis B virus [41], respiratory syncytial virus [42], respiratory syncytial virus [42], respiratory syncytial virus [42], herpes simplex virus type 1 [43,44], monkeypox virus [45], influenza virus [46] and Tacaribe virus [47]. anti-retroviral therapy has significantly improved the quality of life and life expectancy of millions of HIV-infected individuals. HIV eventually develops resistance to these drugs, resulting in a need to change medication regimens and increase in the cost of treatment. the integrated proviral DNA is transcribed to generate full-length progeny viral RNA and a number of spliced mRNA transcripts. the integrated proviral DNA is transcribed to generate full-length progeny viral RNA and a number of spliced mRNA transcripts. they are transported to the site of virus particle assembly at the plasma membrane, where the virus gains access to the extracellular milieu upon budding events. nanoparticles within the range of 1\u201310 nm were able to bind to the virus. the most probable sites for interaction were found to be the sulfur-bearing residues of the gp120 glycoprotein knobs. silver nanoparticles showed to possess a slightly lower inhibition efficacy. silver nanoparticles coated with PVP were effective virucidal agent against cell-free virus. silver nanoparticles inhibit the initial stages of the HIV-1 infection cycle by blocking adsorption and infectivity in a cell-fusion assay. silver nanoparticles inhibit post-entry stages of HIV-1 infection by blocking viral entry, particularly the gp120-CD4 interaction. silver nanoparticles inhibit post-entry stages of the HIV-1 life cycle. 0.025 to 0.15 mg/mL of PVP-coated silver nanoparticles prevented transmission of cell-associated HIV-1 and cell-free HIV-1 isolates. silver nanoparticles exhibited potent cytoprotective and post-infected anti-HIV-1 activities toward Hut/CCR5 cells in a dose-dependent fashion. symptomatic diseases caused by HSV-1 (prototypic -herpesvirus) are generally limited to cold sores of the mouth and keratitis in the eyes. but HSV-1 is capable of causing life-threatening diseases in immunocompromised individuals, including newborns, patients with HIV or patients undergoing immunosuppressive treatment. baram-Pinto et al. have described the potential of exploiting metal nanoparticles for viral inhibition. their strategy was proved valid against HSV-1, but was probably intended and may prove useful against other viruses, such as papillomaviruses. the inability of soluble MES and unmodified metal nanoparticles to control viral infectivity stressed the importance of spatially oriented functional groups anchored on a nanoparticle core for viral inhibition. however, other core materials could also be efficient as long as they are not toxic to the host cells. silver nanoparticles seemed to interact with RSV but without a specific association or spatial arrangement. RF 412-conjugated silver nanoparticles appeared to be floating freely with no proof of regular attachment. silver nanoparticles were able to bind to the viral surface with a regular spatial arrangement. HEp-2 cells were infected with anti-RSV silver nanoparticles mixed with BSA-, PVP- and RF 412-coated silver nanoparticles. infectivity inhibition was evaluated by microscopic examination for syncytia formation and by immunofluorescence microscopy. authors conclude that when silver nanoparticles are conjugated to the PVP protein and mixed with RSV, they bind to the G protein on the viral surface. monodisperse silver nanoparticles were prepared from AgNO3 in HEPES. they measured dimensions of 10 nm (Ag10Ns), 50 nm (Ag50Ns) and 800 nm (Ag800Ns) silver nanoparticles with particle diameters of 800 nm were too toxic for being evaluated as antiviral compound. helical capsid is covered by a lipid envelope containing mainly two virally-encoded glycoproteins. the virus binds to the cell plasma membrane through an interaction between HA and sialic acid residues present on glycoproteins and lipids. this is followed by a mechanism of receptor-mediated endocytosis that brings the enveloped virus particle inside the cytoplasm. the same trend was observed in influenza virus inhibition assays. the sialylated particles of 14 nm size were found to be effective for influenza virus inhibition, whereas the 2 nm analogues did not show significant impact. therefore, they proved that sialic-acid-functionalized gold nanoparticles are able to effectively inhibit viral infection. silver nanoparticles may intervene in early steps of binding and penetration by blocking virus-host cell binding by physical obstruction or disrupt intracellular pathways important for virus replication. some of the nanoparticles analysed in the study promoted an increase in the mean number of MPV plaques/well at the highest concentrations used. silver nanoparticles appear to interact with TCRV prior to cellular exposure resulting in a decrease in viral infectivity with 10 and 25 nm Ag-NPs. silver nanoparticles have been shown to bind easily to the thiol groups [78] which are found in cysteine residues. this interaction can prevent the internalization of the silver nanoparticle together with the virus and produce an inhibitory effect on viral replication. silver nanoparticles bound to the viral glycoproteins may prevent the virus uncoating in the endosome. adenovirus, norovirus, rotavirus, and hepatitis A commonly occur in both surface and groundwater sources [79,80,81] and must be effectively inactivated to provide safe water. silver doping TiO2 significantly enhanced the photocatalytic inactivation of viruses primarily by increasing hydroxyl free radicals production. a considerable removal of MS2 could be obtained in 45 seconds, rendering feasible the goal of achieving virus removal from drinking water using photoreactors exploiting metal nanoparticles. HAART has significantly improved the quality of life and life expectancy of millions of HIV-infected individuals. a conformational change of gp41 leads to membrane fusion and delivery of the capsid to the cytoplasm. the integrated proviral DNA is transcribed to generate full-length progeny viral RNA and a number of spliced mRNA transcripts. the integrated proviral DNA is converted to a double-stranded DNA. silver nanoparticles were not randomly attached to the virus, but all three species established regular spatial relationships with the viral envelope. the most probable sites for interaction were found to be the sulfur-bearing residues of the gp120 glycoprotein knobs. the capacity of silver nanoparticles to inhibit infectivity was determined by in vitro assays. silver nanoparticles inhibit HIV-1 with a therapeutic index 12 times lower than silver nanoparticles. silver nanoparticles inhibit the initial stages of the HIV-1 infection cycle. silver nanoparticles inhibit post-entry stages of the HIV-1 life cycle. silver nanoparticles inhibit post-entry stages of infection by blocking viral entry. virucidal candidate drug has been investigated as a potential topical vaginal microbicide to prevent transmission of HIV-1 infection. the drug was formulated into a non-spermicidal gel (Replens) at a concentration of 0.15 mg/mL. when pre-treatment was carried on for 20 minutes followed by extensive washing the drug conferred almost total protection against HIV-1 transmission. all members of the herpesvirus family cause life-long latent infections. all have a linear, double-stranded DNA genome packaged into an icosahedral capsid. HSV-1 is capable of causing life-threatening diseases in immunocompromised individuals. baram-Pinto et al. have described in two consecutive works the potential of exploiting metal nanoparticles for viral inhibition. their strategy was proved valid against HSV-1, but was probably intended and may prove useful against other viruses, such as papillomaviruses. silver and gold nanoparticles inhibit HSV-1 infections by blocking the attachment and thereby the entrance of the virus into the cells. inability of soluble MES and unmodified metal nanoparticles to control viral infectivity stressed the importance of spatially oriented functional groups anchored on a nanoparticle core for viral inhibition. silver nanoparticles were poly(N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone) (PVP); bovine serum albumin (BSA); and (3) a recombinant F protein from RSV (RF 412). silver nanoparticles were able to bind to the viral surface with a regular spatial arrangement, suggesting a possible interaction with G proteins. HEp-2 cells were infected with RSV silver nanoparticles mixed with BSA-, PVP- and RF 412-coated silver nanoparticles. infectivity inhibition was evaluated by microscopic examination for syncytia formation and by immunofluorescence microscopy. silver nanoparticles bind to the G protein on the viral surface and interfere with viral attachment to the HEp-2 cells resulting in the inhibition of viral infection. monodisperse silver nanoparticles target primarily the viral polymerase reverse-transcriptase. they were prepared from AgNO3 in HEPES and measured dimensions of 10 nm (Ag10Ns), 50 nm (Ag50Ns) and 800 nm (Ag800Ns) silver nanoparticles with particle diameters of 800 nm were too toxic for being evaluated as antiviral compound. this is an orthomyxovirus containing a helical capsid with a genome of eight RNA segments. the capsid is covered by a lipid envelope containing two virally-encoded glycoproteins. the virus binds to the cell plasma membrane through an interaction between HA and sialic acid residues present on glycoproteins and lipids on the surface of the host cell. sialic-acid-functionalized gold nanoparticles are able to effectively inhibit viral infection. the silver nanoparticles used in this work were 25 (Ag-NP-25), 55 (Ag-NP-55) and 80 (Ag-NP-80) nm nanoparticles were coated with polysaccharide, 10 (Ag-PS-10), 25 (Ag-PS-25) and 80 (Ag-PS-80) nanoparticles. silver nanoparticles may intervene in early steps of binding and penetration by blocking virus-host cell binding by physical obstruction or disrupt intracellular pathways important for virus replication. some of the nanoparticles analysed in the study promoted an increase in mean number of MPV plaques/well at the highest concentrations used. the arenaviruses are included in the category A list of potential bio-weapons [75]. the arenaviruses are not a human pathogen, but exhibits a close antigenic relationship with Junin and Guanarito viruses. they could serve well as a model virus for arenavirus derived diseases without human pathogenic potential. binding may favour the internalization of the silver nanoparticle together with the virus. other possible mechanism of action could be related to the fact that the silver nanoparticles bound to the viral glycoproteins may prevent the virus uncoating in the endosome. silver doped titanium dioxide is used for inactivating microorganisms under UV radiation. silver doping significantly enhanced the photocatalytic inactivation by P25 TiO2. a considerable removal of MS2 could be obtained in 45 seconds. metal nanoparticles can alter cellular uptake, protein binding, translocation to target site, and most of the biological interactions with the possibility of causing tissue injury. silver nanoparticles are a major consideration: even if they inhibit viral infections, it would not be beneficial if there are adverse effects to humans or animals. silver nanoparticles were found to be highly cytotoxic to mammalian cells. they interact with biological molecules within mammalian cells and can interfere with the antioxidant defence mechanism leading to the generation of reactive oxygen species. such species can cause damage to biological components through oxidation of lipids, proteins, and DNA. silver nanoparticles production nanoparticles are nanoscale clusters of metallic atoms. different wet chemical methods have been used for the synthesis of metallic nanoparticles. strong reductants lead to small monodisperse particles, while the generation of larger size particles can be difficult to control. enlargement of particles in secondary step from about 20\u201345 nm to 120\u2013170 nm. despite the stability, biological nanoparticles are not monodispersed and the rate of synthesis is slow. despite the stability, biological nanoparticles are not monodispersed and the rate of synthesis is slow. microbial cultivation methods and extraction techniques have to be optimized. nanotechnology has emerged giving the opportunity to re-explore biological properties of known antimicrobial compounds, such as metals, by the manipulation of their sizes. in most cases, a direct interaction between the nanoparticle and the virus surface proteins could be demonstrated or hypothesized. the future holds many surprises, especially considering that the capping molecules that could be investigated are virtually unlimited. additional research is needed to determine how to safely design, use, and dispose products without creating new risk to humans or the environment."}
