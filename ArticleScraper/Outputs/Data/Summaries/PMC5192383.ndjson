{"summary": "Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arthropod-borne virus transmitted by aedes mosquitoes. the virus belongs to the Flavivirus genus, which also includes other pathogens. the virus was first isolated from a sentinel monkey in the Zika forest in 1947. a human volunteer reported low-grade fever, headache, rash, conjunctivitis, arthritis, and myalgia during infection with the African ZIKV strain [13]. in rare cases, infection with the Asian ZIKV is associated with cases of Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome [14] and meningoencephalitis [15]. there is no vaccine or specific therapeutic approaches to prevent or treat ZIKV infections. endothelial cells (hBMEC) were a kind gift from Dr. Julio Scharfstein. cells were cultured in DMEM High Glucose supplemented with 20% FBS. iPSC colonies were manually passaged every 5\u20137 days until they reached 70%\u201380% confluence. human iPSCs were exposed to the serum-free neural induction medium (GIBCO) containing neurobasal medium (GIBCO) and pluripotent stem cell neural induction supplement (GIBCO) the medium was changed every other day until day 7 when initial NSCs are split and grown on neural expansion medium. the cells were infected with ZIKV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01. after 1 h, the inoculum was removed and replaced with DMEM high-glucose (Vero) and Leibovitz L-15 (C6/36) growth media supplemented with 2% FBS. cells were incubated with 4G2, a pan-flavivirus antibody raised against the ZIKV envelope E protein produced in 4G2-4-15 hybridoma (ATCC) cells were labeled with donkey anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 antibody, diluted 1:5 in PBS with 5% FBS. the 4G2 antibody was diluted 1:4 in PBS with 3% BSA. cells were incubated with secondary antibodies coupled to Alexa fluorochromes. samples were imaged using either leica SP5 or leica SPE (Leica Biosystems, Wetzlar, Hesse, DE) these data were plotted and Hill 4 parameter sigmoidal regression was performed on Sigma Plot v.12.0 (Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA, USA) drug Cytotoxicity Assay Vero cells, hBMEC, and NSC were incubated with medium containing chloroquine. RNA was extracted from 200 L supernatant of infected cells using QIAmp miniElute Virus Spin (QIAgen, Hilden, D\u00fcsseldorf,DE) the supernatant was evaluated by plaque assay. human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMEC) were a kind gift from Dr. Julio Scharfstein. cells were cultured in DMEM High Glucose supplemented with 20% FBS. human iPSCs were exposed to the serum-free neural induction medium (GIBCO) containing neurobasal medium (GIBCO) and pluripotent stem cell neural induction supplement (GIBCO) the medium was changed every other day until day 7 when initial NSCs are split and grown on neural expansion medium. geu Magalhes was isolated from a patient presenting classical symptoms of ZIKV infection [28]. the cells were infected with ZIKV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01. after 1 h, the inoculum was removed and medium containing chloroquine (6.25 to 50 M) was incubated at 37 \u00b0C. cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma Aldrich) in phosphate buffered saline. cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma Aldrich) in PBS. cells were incubated with 4G2, a pan-flavivirus antibody raised against the ZIKV envelope E protein produced in 4G2-4-15 hybridoma (ATCC) the 4G2 antibody was diluted 1:4 in PBS with 3% BSA. cells were incubated with secondary antibodies coupled to Alexa fluorochromes. samples were imaged using either leica SP5 or leica SPE. in order to calculate the 50% cytotoxicity concentration (CC50), MFI values were normalized over the untreated control. these data were plotted and Hill 4 parameter sigmoidal regression was performed on Sigma Plot v.12.0 (Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA, USA) infected cells were infected with ZIKV MR766 or ZIKV BR strain at an MOI of 2 for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C. RNA was collected and analyzed by relative quantification by RT-qPCR. the supernatant was also evaluated by plaque assay to quantitate the infectious virus particles. chloroquine treatment decreased the number of ZIKV-infected cells in a dose-dependent manner. Flow cytometry analysis showed a reduction of 35% and 65% in ZIKV-infected cells when cultures were treated with 25 M and 50 M chloroquine. ZIKV infection was evaluated by immunofluorescence staining with 4G2 antibody (green) and DAPI (blue); infectious (C) or total (D) virus particles were quantified on the supernatant 48 h post-infection. supernatant was quantified as a direct measurement of ZIKV infection. treatment with 25 M chloroquine led to a 16-fold reduction in the level of viral RNA detected in the supernatant. chloroquine added at 24 h post-infection had a greater impact on the production of ZIKV particles, decreasing viral RNA 64-fold over the controls. however, chloroquine added at 24 h post-infection had only a minor effect on viral production. these results were confirmed by quantification of ZIKV infectious particles released after chloroquine treatment. chloroquine reduces the number of ZIKV-infected human brain microvascular endothelial cells. hBMECs were infected with MR 766 at an MOI of 2 followed by chloroquine treatment for 5 days. hBMECs were incubated with chloroquine for 5 days. Chloroquine treatment decreased the number of NSCs infected with ZIKV MR766 by 57%. hNSCs were infected with the Brazilian strain. hNSCs were infected with ZIKV MR766 at an MOI of 2. neurospheres infected with ZIKV strain MR766 showed convoluted and misshapen neurites. newrite extension was evaluated in chloroquine treated cultures by microtubule-associated protein 2 (Map2) staining and phase contrast microscopy. Flow cytometry analysis showed a reduction of 35% and 65% in ZIKV-infected cells when cultures were treated with 25 M and 50 M chloroquine. chloroquine decreased production of infectious (Figure 1C) and total (Figure 1D) virus particles, including defective viral particles, by ZIKV-infected cells. the dashed line represents no reduction in RNA levels. cell viability of uninfected cells treated with increasing concentrations of chloroquine was evaluated by fluorescence measurement at 560/590 nm. the supernatant was collected 30 h post-infection and virus production was evaluated by relative quantification of viral RNA over the untreated control. the addition of chloroquine from 30 min to 12 h post-infection had only a minor effect on viral production. chloroquine interferes with the early stages of the ZIKV replication cycle. early stages of infection are inhibited by chloroquine. vero cells were infected with ZIKV MR766 at an MOI of 10 and 50 M. hBMECs were infected with ZIKV MR 766 at an MOI of 2 followed by chloroquine treatment for 5 days. cell viability was analyzed; protection against ZIKV infection was measured through cell viability in chloroquine-treated cells. hNSCs were infected with ZIKV MR766 at an MOI of 2. hNSCs were incubated with increasing concentrations of chloroquine for 4 days. cytotoxicity was assessed by viability of uninfected hNSCs treated with chloroquine. Chloroquine inhibits ZIKV infection in mouse neurospheres. mouse neurospheres were infected with ZIKV MR766 (2.5 105 PFU) mice were treated with chloroquine for 3 days. the EC50 or concentration of chloroquine protected 50% of the cells from ZIKV infection assessed by cell viability. the values of EC50 obtained for ZIKV MR766 are lower than those obtained for DENV inhibition (25 M) and HIV inhibition (100 M) one of the trials evaluated the benefits of chloroquine treatment for 3 days in patients infected with DENV. however, a trend towards a reduction in the number of dengue hemorrhagic fever cases was noticed in the chloroquine-treated group. the antiviral effect of chloroquine may be insufficient to produce a decrease in viral load or improvement of the disease progression. chloroquine is widely distributed to body tissues as well as its analogue hydroxychloroquine. the concentration of hydroxychloroquine in the brain is 4\u201330 times higher than in the plasma. chloroquine in the plasma reached 10 M when a daily intake of 500 mg was prescribed to arthritis patients [47]. different mechanisms for the chloroquine inhibition of viral infection have been described [49,50,51] different mechanisms for the chloroquine inhibition of viral infection have been described. our data showed that chloroquine inhibits the infection of human neural stem cells. the protective effect of chloroquine on stem cells and committed progenitors is potentially a groundbreaking feature of this compound."}
