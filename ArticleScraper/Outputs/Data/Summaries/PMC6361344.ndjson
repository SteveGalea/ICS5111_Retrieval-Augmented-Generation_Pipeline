{"summary": "increased intracranial pressure (ICP) has been suggested in legal settings as an alternative cause of retinal hemorrhages (RHs) in children with increased ICP. infants who were premature, neonates, and suspected survivors of abusive head trauma were excluded. study was approved by the Wills Eye Hospital Institutional Review Board and by the institutional review boards of each of the 9 participating sites. eligible patients with increased ICP were identified by an on-site investigator or contact person in the neurosurgical service, general pediatric service, or PICU within 24 hours of admission. a direct ICP measurement of 25 cm H2O was used as a quantitative criterion for inclusion. there was no definitively established threshold for abnormally high ICP in infants and toddlers at the onset of the study. infants 1 year of age born before 36 weeks\u2019 gestation, neonates 4 weeks postpartum, and children diagnosed as survivors of AHT independent of the eye findings were excluded. informed consent was obtained from at least 1 parent or guardian for all enrolled children who met the study criteria to allow for the disclosure of the deidentified data from their ophthalmic and neurosurgical care providers to the data collection site. the consent discussion included the disclosure of the possibility of an investigation for AHT. hypertension has not been reported as a cause of isolated RHs. no child had a confounding condition, such as hyponatremia, hypernatremia, or coagulopathy. all 56 children met the clinical criteria for increased ICP defined above. we had no children who presented with increased ICP caused by trauma. imaging findings revealed hydrocephalus or ventriculomegaly in 45 children. etiologies of elevated ICP are summarized in Table 4. shunts had been placed previously for hydrocephalus caused by an intracranial cyst. elevation in ICP was attributed to the shunt obstruction rather than the cysts. 9 children were noted to have papilledema (a clinical sign of increased ICP) by a nonophthalmologist. results from an evaluation conducted by an ophthalmologist revealed optic disc swelling in 1 child who did not have any RH. a view of the entire retina was obtained in 91% of children. we believe it is unlikely that RHs would be present in this most anterior zone yet absent in the other 3 zones that comprise the majority of the retina. the most frequent cause of increased ICP in their study was idiopathic intracranial hypertension (70% of patients), whereas we had no patients with this etiology in our study. the prevalence of RHs and papilledema appears to be higher in older children with fused cranial sutures; the age range of children in our study was 1 to 43 months (mean 15.4 months). authors of 1 study of increased ICP found postmortem optic nerve sheath hemorrhages in 87% of eyes (40 of 46) and intraocular hemorrhages in 37% of eyes (17 of 46). authors found no significant association between raised ICP (as determined by using direct measurement or clinical and/or radiologic signs) and RHs. authors note that they cannot establish causation. all of the systemic diagnoses involved significant cerebral compression (severe cerebral trauma, spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage, ruptured berry aneurysm, and internal carotid occlusion resulting in cerebral swelling without hemorrhage) these diagnoses are far more common in adults and were not seen in any of our patients. children included in this study are unlikely to represent biased selection. we did not include children with AHT who had increased ICP to avoid confounding etiologies. study of 56 children with increased ICP found no cases of increased ICP causing RH regardless of the etiology of increased ICP, age of the child, or duration of ICP elevation."}
