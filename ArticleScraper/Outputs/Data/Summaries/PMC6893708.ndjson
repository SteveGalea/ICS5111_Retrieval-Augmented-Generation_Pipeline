{"summary": "HIV-1 has the ability to rapidly mutate in infected individuals [3] and take advantage of host genes like C-C chemokine receptor type 5 [4], therefore it is imperative to know whether certain variations confer any survival advantage to the virus. the basic domain of Tat (49\u201372 aa) is involved in binding to TAR [16], nuclear localization [17] and plasma membrane permeability [18]. Tat is involved in RNAi silencing suppressor (RSS) activity [20] and induction of cell death in T cells [21]. RNA silencing is a eukaryotic posttranscriptional gene regulation mechanism. in-vitro studies have shown that Tat promotes cell death during HIV-1 infection via intrinsic pathway in human cell lines [32] the glutamine-rich region of HIV-1 Tat protein is involved in the Tat-mediated cell death of T-cells [35] IL) activation of cyclin-dependent kinases, microtubule alteration and inhibition of expression of manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase have been shown. however, the subtype-specific abilities of Tat and natural Tat variants for RSS activity and cell death have not been explored. the Jurkat cells were maintained in RPMI supplemented with l-glutamine, 10 mM HEPES, 23.8 mM sodium carbonate, penicillin (100 U/mL) and streptomycin (0.1 mg/mL) all cell types were transfected with lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) in serum free DMEM media. cells were harvested after 24 h post-transfection. total protein was extracted using RIPA lysis buffer (Invitrogen) total protein was extracted using phosphatase inhibitor tablets (Invitrogen) RNA was isolated from the transfected cell lysates using Trizol (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and reverse transcribed using a RT-PCR kit. a g of template RNA and 1 M terminal primers were combined in a 5 L reaction volume. the mix was thermally denatured at 70 \u00b0C for 5 mins and subsequently chilled on ice for 3 mins. shRNA for luciferase (an unrelated shRNA control referred as shRNA-luc) was used as a control, while shRNA for green fluorescence (nucleotide [nt] positions 973 to 994 referred as shRNA-GFP) was used to abrogate GFP expression. the negative control was un-transfected cells, the positive control was transfected cells with shRNA-luc and the RSS control was transfected cells with shRNA infected cells were collected and washed in 1 PBS containing PI. cells were re-suspended in 1 PBS containing PI at a final concentration of 10 g/mL. cells were analyzed on flow-cytometer (BD-LSRII) for PI incorporation to measure cell death. TatC (93IN905 GenBank accession number AF067158) received from NIH AIDS Reagent Program and Indian Tat variants (TatN12, TatD60, TatVT6) were cloned into mammalian expression vector pCMV-Myc (Clonetech, Mountain View, CA, USA) under the cytomegalovirus promoter for functional characterization described in this study. all cell types were transfected with lipofectamine 2000 (invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) in serum free DMEM media. for each transfection, 1 g of vector DNA was diluted in 250 L media. empty control vector DNA was used to normalize equal amounts of vector DNA (Tat cloned into) in each transfection. the membranes were incubated with Tat antibody (1:2000 dilution), anti-cytochrome C antibody (1:2500 dilution) and GAPDH (1:5000 dilution) overnight at 4 \u00b0C after one hour of blocking with nonfat milk of 5%, and then washed three times with PBS with 0.1% Tween 20. RNAi Silencing Suppressor Assay To study the RSS activities of Tat subtypes and our Tat variants, we used a similar mammalian system vector, a bi-cistronic gene vector Retro-Q. in this vector, shRNA for luciferase (an unrelated shRNA control referred as shRNA-luc) was used as a control, while shRNA for green fluorescence (nucleotide positions 973 to 994 referred the shRNA-GFP (0.5 g in 1 mL) was co-transfected either with Tat variants (TatN12 or TatVT6 or TatD60) or empty pCMV-Myc vector in HEK293T cells (1 g plasmid DNA/well in 1 106 cells) after 24 h of co-transfection, cell lysates were analyzed for GFP expression. the number of cells stained with PI were counted and expressed in percentage. the level of cell death was measured by comparing the empty pCMV-Myc vector with subtype TatB, C and Tat variants. the experiment was repeated three times for confirmation of the results. the empty pCMV-Myc vector was used as a control to measure the relative protein intensity. all Tat variants and subtypes were well expressed (p 0.0005) at the translational level which were normalized to the expression levels of control GAPDH. panel (B and C) Tat variants (TatN12 or TatVT6 or TatD60) or Tat subtypes (TatB or TatC) or empty pCMV-Myc vector were checked for intracellular expression by transfecting on human embryonic kidney 293. the relative protein and RNA intensity of Tat variants was calculated by normalizing with the amount of beta-actin expressed in the corresponding Tat variants. the level of GAPDH was used as a loading control and the empty pCMV-Myc vector was used as a negative control. TatV6 and TatD60 showed 11% RSS activity compared to TatC. the results indicate the role of Tat as a RSS activator in our system. the cells treated with shRNA-GFP vector + empty pCMV-Myc vector were used as a control to make gating for the transfected cells. the cells treated with shRNA-GFP vector were used as a control to show that there was no effect of pCMV-Myc vector in RSS activity. cells treated with shRNA-GFPvector + empty pCMV-Myc vector were used as a control for the transfected cells. the cells treated with shRNA-GFPvector + empty pCMV-Myc vector were used as a control for the transfected cells. in-vitro cell death analysis was carried out using HEK293T cells transfected with Tat variants. cell death was measured 24 h after transfection by PI staining followed by flow-cytometry with empty pCMV-Myc vector. cell death induced by Tat variants and subtypes was measured by PI staining followed by flow-cytometry with the empty pCMV-Myc vector was used as a control. cells treated with empty pCMV-Myc showed similar levels of cell death to that of un-transfected cells. the untreated control Jurkat T-cells showed no cytoplasmic release of cytochrome\u2013C. the untreated control Jurkat T-cells showed no cytoplasmic release of cytochrome\u2013C. TatD60 was expressed at a higher level than other TatC variants. all Tat variants and subtypes were well expressed (p 0.0005) at the translational level. the relative protein intensity was calculated from the control pCMV-Myc vector. our TatC variants, TatN12 (accession No. HQ110625), a subtype C variant with Leucine35Proline and Glycine44Serine. TatD60 (accession No. HQ110614), a subtype C variant with Glutamic_acid9Lysine, Serine46Phenylalanine and Serine61Arginine. multiple-group comparisons were performed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by student t-test. NS is non-significant; all experiments were repeated three times. the relative GFP intensity of Tat variants was calculated by normalizing with the expression of empty pCMV-Myc vector. all Tat variants and subtypes were found to show varying levels of RSS activity depending on the types of Tat. c vector was used to show that there was no effect of pCMV-Myc vector in RSS activity. multiple-group comparisons were performed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by student t-test. 93T cells were co-transfected with shRNA-GFP (0.5 g in 1 mL) and Tat variants (TatN12 or TatVT6 or TatD60) or empty pCMV-Myc vector. cells treated with shRNA-GFPvector + empty pCMV-Myc vector were used as a control for the transfected cells. the level of cell death induced by TatN12 was 24%. TatVT6 induced cell death by 42%, which was higher (p 0.005) than TatC. all Tat variants and variants showed varying levels (p 0.0005) of cell death. the relative cell death of Tat variants was measured by subtracting empty pCMV-Myc vector values. the cells treated with empty pCMV-Myc showed similar levels of cell death to that of un-transfected cells. the untreated control Jurkat T-cells showed no cytoplasmic release of cytochrome\u2013C. the untreated Jurkat T-cells showed no cytoplasmic release of cytochrome\u2013C. the study aimed to find the role of natural Tat variants. TatB showed more potent RSS activity than TatC and other Tat variants. this could be due to variation in the cysteine-rich and glutamine-rich regions. this study elucidates the importance of unique polymorphisms in Tat variants (TatN12 and TatD60) as well as subtype-specific variations in cysteine and glutamine regions of TatVT6. augmentation in these activities could greatly enhance HIV fitness."}
