{"summary": "pneumomediastinum is the term which defines the presence of air in the mediastinum. it refers to the presence of air into the mediastinum in otherwise healthy subjects without an obvious causative factor such as an operation. pneumomediastinum is a rare entity, diagnosed in 1/44,500 of accident and emergency attendances or 1/100,000 of natural births. many authors believe that the occurrence of pneumomediastinum has a more favorable outcome compared to secondary pneumomediastinum. stinum is more frequent than initially believed due to underdiagnosis (3,4). infrequently the pathology may not be indentified on the chest radiograph. consequently related symptoms may be attributed to musculoskeletal pain or other insignificant causes. presenting signs include rhinolalia (nasally sounding voice), hoarseness and neck swelling. clinical evaluation may also identify tachycardia, tachypnea or anxiety. a specific sign with an infrequent appearance (6,9,10) should be sought for. the presence of a pneumothorax missed on a plain chest X-ray in cases with severe subcutaneous emphysema may also be confirmed with a CT scan. a detailed information of the patient\u2019s previous health status is of paramount importance and cannot be emphasized enough. management Pneumomediastinum is generally considered a benign entity of little clinical importance with good prognosis. following diagnosis patients are usually hospitalized for at least 24 hours merely for observation. physical activity should be discouraged and bed rest must be ensured. air can dissect between the mediastinum and the upper spine causing pneumorrhachis (free air in the spinal canal) in rare situations air can dissect between the mediastinum and the upper spine causing pneumorrhachis (free air in the spinal canal)"}
