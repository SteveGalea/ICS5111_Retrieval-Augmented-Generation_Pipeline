{"summary": "platelets are small, anucleate fragments derived from megakaryocytes that are vital for maintaining hemostasis. they also contribute to other pathophysiological processes, including atherogenesis,1 inflammation,2 wound repair,3 angiogenesis,4 blood-lymphatic vessel separation,5 and cancer metastasis. understanding how platelets undergo this transition has broad implications for a number of diseases. two of the most powerful platelet inhibitors are prostacyclin (PGI2) and nitric oxide (NO), which are released by healthy endothelia. they act by elevating intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate and cyclic guanosine monophosphate levels in the platelet via adenylate cyclase and soluble guanylate cyclase. these cyclic nucleotides in turn activate protein tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM)-containing receptors provide a more specialized, cell-intrinsic inhibition compared with PGI2 and NO by targeting ITAM-containing receptors. all ITIM-containing receptors belong to the immunoglobulin receptor superfamily and carry at least 1 consensus ITIM sequence in their cytoplasmic tail. phosphatases are able to dephosphorylate and inactivate key components of the ITAM-containing receptor signaling pathway. a third ITIM-like motif, termed an immunoreceptor tyrosine\u2013based switch motif, confers activating and/or inhibitory properties to a receptor. KO mice lacking LAIR-1 exhibit a mild thrombocytosis and increased proplatelet formation in vitro. two ITSM-containing SLAM family members, CD150 and CD84, have been identified in platelets. the main structural features are shown, including the extracellular IgC2-like and IgV-like domains. the main intracellular signaling motifs are ITIMs (consensus sequence I/V/LxYxxL/V), ITSMs (consensus sequence TxYxxV/I), and PRRs (consensus sequence PxxP) shp1, Shp2, SHIP1, p85 (PI3K), Lyn Hemostasis: tail bleeding Thrombosis: onset, size, stability in laser and ferric chloride injury models G6b-B Expression: megakaryocyte and platelet specific Constitutive and Pf4-Cre KO Attenuates GPVI- and ADP-induced aggregation and Ca2+ release. constitutive KO Augments platelet aggregation to multiple agonists 20, 75, 77, 78, 80 Isoforms: sTLT-1 (shed extracellular domain) Platelet count: 20% Associates with ERM proteins, potentially linking fibrinogen to the cytoskeleton MW: 38 kDa Platelet volume: unknown Ectodomain: single IgV-like domain. platelets, intestinal tissue crypt epithelia, kidney, testis, and several brain nuclei Constitutive KO Attenuates GPVI- and CLEC-2\u2013mediated platelet activation 22, 84 Isoforms. most dominant in platelets is CEACAM2-2L Platelet count: normal Augmented phosphorylation of PLC2, Src, and Syk in response to CRP and rhodocytin in ceacam2/ platelets MW: 52 k we focus on PECAM-1, G6b-B, and TLT-1, which together illustrate the old, the new, and the nonconventional members of this family of receptors in platelets. we compiled this review to summarize structural and functional features, landmark discoveries, controversies, and intriguing new findings. PECAM-1 is expressed on the majority of nonerythroid hematopoietic cells, including platelets, monocytes, neutrophils, T cells, and vascular endothelial cells. this 130-kDa receptor has a large, highly glycosylated extracellular domain comprised of 6 immunoglobulin constant 2 (IgC2)-like domains. the 15 isoform is the most prevalent in human platelets. platelet PECAM-1 serves to limit thrombus size,35. heterophilic binding partners include the integrin V336 and neutrophils CD17737 and CD38,38. tyrosine residues are numbered according to the mature protein after cleavage. primary function of platelet PECAM-1 is to inhibit platelet activation and thrombosis at sites of vascular injury by attenuating signaling from the ITAM-containing receptor complex GPVI-FcR -chain when it engages collagen. this inhibition can, however, be overcome with high concentrations of GPVI agonists. e phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.44 PECAM-1 also contributes to integrin IIb3 outside-in signaling,45 and to GPIb internalization in an IIb-dependent manner. phenotype could be due to upregulation of compensatory mechanisms that limit platelet spreading on fibrinogen in the absence of PECAM-1. the use of bone marrow chimeric mice proved this to be primarily due to loss of platelet, rather than endothelial, PECAM-1. a separate study reported no difference in thrombus formation or bleeding between wild-type and Pecam1/ mice. however, there is little if any collagen exposure in this thrombosis model. PECAM-1\u2013deficient megakaryocytes exhibit aberrant spatial distribution in the bone marrow after antibody-mediated platelet depletion. many studies have highlighted the importance of PECAM-1 in a broad range of cell types, including endothelial, hematopoietic and immune cells. thrombosis models support this hypothesis because platelet PECAM-1 serves to limit thrombus size,35. but low-affinity interactions under resting conditions cannot be discounted. heterophilic binding partners include the integrin V336 and neutrophils CD17737 and CD38,38. conserved tyrosine residues are numbered according to the mature protein. primary function of platelet PECAM-1 is to inhibit platelet activation and thrombosis at sites of vascular injury by attenuating signaling from the ITAM-containing receptor complex GPVI-FcR -chain. this inhibition can, however, be overcome with high concentrations of GPVI agonists. PECAM-1 can sequester activating SH2 domain\u2013containing proteins. PECAM-1 also contributes to integrin IIb3 outside-in signaling,45 and to GPIb internalization in an IIb-dependent manner. the use of bone marrow chimeric mice proved this to be primarily due to loss of platelet, rather than endothelial, PECAM-1. tail bleeding times were increased in Pecam1/ mice due to a loss of endothelial PECAM-1. however, there is little if any collagen exposure in this thrombosis model. this impairment is attributed to a lack of polarity of the leading edge of migrating megakaryocytes, mediated by the polarized compartmentalization of stromal-derived factor-1 chemokine receptor CXCR4. however, PECAM-1\u2013deficient megakaryocytes exhibit aberrant spatial distribution in the bone marrow after antibody-mediated platelet depletion. the main structural features are shown, including the IgV domain, ITIM, ITSM, and PRR. G6b-C, -D, and -E are predicted to be secreted because they lack the transmembrane domain. the ectodomain of heparin has a theoretical isoelectric point >10. the best-known function of heparin is as a cofactor of antithrombin III. both mouse and human G6b-B are very similar in terms of expression. reduced platelet recovery after antibody-mediated platelet depletion. increased platelet clearance due to platelets being preactivated. 80% to 90% reduction in platelet count has only mild bleeding and thrombotic consequences in mice. this was further demonstrated by using Gp6+/G6b+/ mouse platelets. antibody-mediated depletion of CLEC-2 in addition to deletion of Gp6 only partially rescued the G6b/ phenotype. this suggests that G6b-B has undefined functions in megakaryocytes and platelets. a family that exhibited an autosomal recessive thrombocytopenia. patients exhibited severe thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly, an increased number of megakaryocytes, and fibrosis in bone marrow biopsies. patients harboring this mutation were not reported to have a bleeding diathesis. a pool of active SFKs can rapidly phosphorylate the GPVI-FcR -chain receptor after ligand engagement. active Lyn and Fyn are constitutively associated with the GPVI membrane\u2013proximal PRR via their SH3 domain. the biological function of G6b-B extends beyond that of inhibiting ITAM-containing receptor signaling in platelets. the identification of G6b-B came almost a decade after that of PECAM-1,55. it is likely that the elucidation of its endogenous ligand will greatly enhance our understanding of its function. all G6b isoforms have a single variable-type IgV domain. they are N-glycosylated (1 predicted site in humans and 2 in mice) two PRRs in the juxtamembrane region may provide docking sites for SH3 domain\u2013containing proteins. the best-known function of heparin is as a cofactor of antithrombin III. the best-known function of heparin is as a cofactor of antithrombin III. both mouse and human G6b-B are very similar in terms of expression. platelet surface receptor levels were also altered to varying degrees in G6b/ mice, particularly GPVI. this was most likely attributable to increased receptor shedding mediated by the metalloproteinase ADAM10. reduced platelet counts alone cannot fully explain bleeding diathesis. G6b-B has undefined functions in megakaryocytes and platelets. this is independent of its inhibitory effect on ITAM-containing receptor signaling. this function is to positively regulate integrin-mediated spreading. mice expressing human and mouse G6b-B do not exhibit any of these defects. this supports the hypothesis that human and mouse G6b-B perform the same physiological functions and are critical regulators of platelet homeostasis. a pool of active SFKs can rapidly phosphorylate the GPVI-FcR -chain receptor after ligand engagement. active Lyn and Fyn are constitutively associated with the GPVI membrane\u2013proximal PRR via their SH3 domain. this interaction is important for the kinetics of GPVI signaling. TLT-1 is a type I single IgV-containing surface receptor with an intracellular ITIM- and ITSM-like sequence. TREM-1 recruits the ITAM-containing adaptor protein DAP12 via a positive lysine residue in its transmembrane domain. however, its expression in blood cells is restricted to megakaryocytes and platelets. expression PECAM-1 9400 42.45 5566 358.61 G6b-B 13700 638.61 29637 54.31 TLT-1 14200 568.68 154769 1118.59 CEACAM1 Not detected 0.01 868 45.21 CEACAM2 N/A N/A not detected 0.41 LILRB2 (PIR-B) not detected 0.63 not detected 0 LAIR-1 Not detected 0.88 not detected 0 CD84 2900 7.60 9261 KO mouse model of TLT-1 revealed a critical role for this receptor in dampening the inflammatory response and facilitating platelet aggregation at sites of vascular injury. TLT-1\u2013deficient mice also exhibit a 20% reduction in platelet count, suggesting a role in platelet production and/or clearance. TLT-1 is a type I single IgV-containing surface receptor with an intracellular ITIM- and ITSM-like sequence. it is localized specifically in -granules in resting platelets, and is upregulated on the surface after thrombin-mediated activation. despite containing an ITIM and a nonconsensus ITSM, TLT-1 is localized specifically in -granules in resting platelets. TLT-1 inhibits aggregation.78 Table 3. Platelet ITIM- and ITSM-containing receptor protein and RNA expression levels Receptor Human Mouse Protein expression Gene expression PECAM-1 9400 42.45 5566 358.61 G6b-B 13700 638.61 29637 54.31 TLT-1 14200 568.68 154769 1118.59 CEACAM1 Not detected 0.01 868 45.21 CEACAM2 N/A N/A Not detected 0.41 KO mouse model of TLT-1 revealed a critical role for this receptor in dampening the inflammatory response and facilitating platelet aggregation at sites of vascular injury. TLT-1\u2013deficient mice exhibit a 20% reduction in platelet count, suggesting a role in platelet production and/or clearance. several key questions remain, including the functional role of TLT-1 in platelets and megakaryocytes, how it signals, and whether platelet TLT-1 regulates leukocyte localization and function. several other ITIM-containing receptors have been shown to regulate platelet activation and thrombus formation. the close proximity of the Ceacam1 and Ceacam2 genes on chromosome 7 makes generation of double-deficient mice technically challenging. CEACAM1 is not detected in human platelets by proteomics-based approaches and at a low copy number in mouse platelets (868 copies per platelet) the reason for this discrepancy is not known, but it may simply be a reflection of low abundance. KO and transgenic mouse models have been pivotal in establishing the physiological functions of these receptors in the megakaryocyte lineage. despite all platelet ITIM-containing receptors interacting with Shp1 and Shp2, phenotypic analyses of mouse models indicate additional roles beyond exclusively inhibiting ITAM receptor signaling. the authors declare no competing financial interests."}
