{"summary": "the viral factories that are assembled after viral infection serve as such sites. animal-derived RNA viruses often form viral inclusion bodies. negative-strand RNA viruses are known to generate inclusion bodies. BDV is a non-segmented negative-strand (NNS) RNA virus that belongs to the family Bornaviridae of the order Mononegavirales. almost all eukaryotic RNA viruses replicate in the cytoplasm of infected cells. this virus is believed to be the only animal RNA virus that can establish a parasitic infection within the nucleus. vSPOTs contain spherical structures with pores of 100 nm in diameter. the viral RNPs rapidly relocate to condensed mitotic chromosomes. the regulated dynamics of the viral factories may be critical to maintaining the unique persistent infection of BDV in the host cell nucleus. uridine analog FU was added to the culture medium of BDV-infected OL cells. immunofluorescence staining was performed with an anti-N monoclonal antibody. DNA was counterstained with DAPI. it is not known whether these viral proteins assemble into isomorphic vSPOTs within the nucleus. new microscopic imaging techniques have been developed to overcome the resolution limit of light microscopy (17) anti-X polyclonal/anti-N monoclonal antibodies (D and E), anti-X polyclonal/anti-P monoclonal antibodies (F and G), and anti-M polyclonal antibodies (H and I) vSPOTs were observed in the form of variably sized structures in infected nuclei. vSPOTs are assembled intranuclear porous structures formed by N. the ring formed by N contained small gaps of apparently 100 nm in diameter. X and M were also found within the vSPOTs. vSPOTs were mainly localized on the edges of vSPOTs, as was observed with SIM. the same images reconstructed with a 120-nm resolution were very similar in appearance to the images obtained by SIM. the sizes of gaps were large enough compared with the resolution limit of dSTORM. viral components are relocated to condensed chromosomes concurrently with the disruption of the nuclear envelope at prometaphase. as shown in Fig. 5, we investigated the distribution of viral proteins on metaphase chromosomes. X rarely colocalized with N during mitosis. the arrowheads in F indicate co-localization of N and X. vSPOTs contain genome-sense RNA (13) vSPOTs require viral replication for their formation. uridine analog FU was added to the culture medium of BDV-infected OL cells and incubated for 2 h. DNA was counterstained with DAPI. the specific signals were observed by using CLSM. new microscopic imaging techniques have been developed to overcome the resolution limit of light microscopy (17) structured illumination microscopy (SIM) has a spatial resolution that is twice that of conventional microscopy (18, 19) SIM revealed that N formed a thin ring constituting the rim of each vSPOT. arrowheads in B indicate regions on the edges of the vSPOTs. vSPOTs were observed in the form of variably sized structures in infected nuclei. ring formed by N contained small gaps of apparently 100 nm in diameter. X and M were also found within the vSPOTs, but they were more randomly distributed than P. vSPOTs are assembled intranuclear porous structures formed by N. the same images reconstructed with a 120-nm resolution were very similar in appearance to the images obtained by SIM. the sizes of gaps (59\u2013180 nm) were large enough compared with the resolution limit of dSTORM (here we conservatively used 30-nm Gaussian spots for reconstruction) dSTORM revealed that the outer layers of vSPOTs seemed to be composed of filamentous structures. viral RNPs relocated to condensed chromosomes in the form of vSPOT-like structures. vSPOT-like structures stayed closely on mitotic chromosomes. intense N and P signals stayed very closely on mitotic chromosomes. X rarely colocalized with N. arrowheads in F indicate co-localization of N and X. vSPOTs are the viral replication factors of BDV. vSPOTs contain both structural and non-structural proteins of BDV. the average number of vSPOTs per cell was 4.6 (S.D. 5.0) and the average diameter of vSPOTs was 0.66 m (S.D. 0.2) super-resolution microscopic imaging techniques have been developed to overcome the resolution limit of light microscopy (17) structured illumination microscopy (SIM), one type of super-resolution microscopy, has a spatial resolution that is twice that of conventional microscopy (18, 19). SIM revealed that N formed a thin ring constituting the rim of each vSPOT. vSPOTs were observed in the form of variably sized structures in infected nuclei. arrowheads in B indicate regions on the edges of the vSPOTs. vSPOTs were observed in the form of variably sized structures. X and M were also found within the vSPOTs, but they were more randomly distributed than P (Fig. 3, B\u2013D). together, these observations demonstrated that vSPOTs are assembled intranuclear porous structures formed by N. same images reconstructed with a 120-nm resolution were very similar in appearance to the images obtained by SIM. the sizes of gaps (59\u2013180 nm) were large enough compared with the resolution limit of dSTORM. dSTORM revealed that the outer layers of vSPOTs seemed to be composed of filamentous structures. C\u2013F, SIM analyses of the metaphase chromosomes of BDV-infected OL cells. the cells were stained with anti-P polyclonal/anti-N monoclonal antibodies (A and D) and with anti-X polyclonal/anti-N monoclonal antibodies (E and F) vSPOTs are the Viral Replication Factories of BDV Previous studies have revealed that the expression of N or phosphoprotein (P) alone is insufficient for the formation of vSPOT-like structures. vSPOTs require viral replication for their formation and contain viral RNAs. vSPOTs contain both structural and non-structural proteins of BDV. the average number of vSPOTs per cell was 4.6 (S.D. 5.0) and the average diameter of vSPOTs was 0.66 m (S.D. 0.2) imaging techniques, called super-resolution microscopic techniques, have been developed to overcome the resolution limit of light microscopy (17). we therefore applied SIM to the structural analysis of the vSPOTs in BDV-infected nuclei to investigate the locations of the viral proteins in the vSPOTs. the arrowheads in B indicate regions on the edges of the vSPOTs. vSPOTs were observed in the form of variably sized structures in infected nuclei. vSPOTs are assembled intranuclear porous structures formed by N. X and M were also found within the vSPOTs, but they were more randomly distributed than P (Fig. 3, B\u2013D). together, these observations demonstrated that vSPOTs are assembled intranuclear porous structures formed by N. dSTORM revealed that the outer layers of vSPOTs seemed to be composed of filamentous structures. rosary-like thin filaments were observed protruding from the outer frames of the vSPOTs. arrowheads in A indicate the gaps observed in SIM. we investigated the distribution of viral proteins on metaphase chromosomes. vSPOT-like structures exist as filamentous structures, not ring-like structures, in association with metaphase chromosomes. intense N and P signals stayed very closely on mitotic chromosomes. structural analyses of the inclusion bodies of some NNS viruses have been conducted by using CLSM and immuno-EM techniques. however, the precise distribution, as well as the interaction of each viral protein in these structures, has not been demonstrated. this lack of information is due in large part to the limitations of conventional methods, such as the resolution of microscopy and the difficulties of immunostaining. newly synthesized RNAs of NNS viruses have been detected in infected cells. an exoskeleton consisting of N might play a role in protecting nascent viral RNAs against degradation and/or the host-sensing of these RNAs. in previous studies, inclusion bodies have been identified as the replication sites of NNS viruses. EM analysis has shown that the rims of the vSPOTs contain RNP-like helical structures. this suggests that the RNPs in the vSPOTs might have at least two different functions. HMGB1 directly interacts with P in infected cells. vSPOTs are rapidly deconstructed during prometaphase and that BDV RNPs relocate to the condensed chromosomes. vSPOT formation is controlled by host factor(s) whose expression or association with BDV RNPs may change concurrently with the disruption of the nuclear envelope at prometaphase. the mechanism by which vSPOTs are rapidly deconstructed coordinately with the disruption of the nuclear envelope is still unknown. in this study, we showed that BDV RNP assembles a virus-specific porous cage-like viral factory. microscopy was performed using an A1 confocal laser-scanning microscope (Nikon) with a CFI Apo Lambda S 60 objective lens (N.A. = 1.4, Olympus) raw SIM images were obtained with a deltaVision OMX imaging system (GE Healthcare) equipped with a UPlanSApo 100 oil-immersion objective lens. dSTORM images were obtained in wide-field mode with a DeltaVision OMX imaging system. the samples were illuminated with a 633-nm laser at maximum power. 20,000\u201330,000 images (256 256 pixels) were recorded at a frame rate of 33 Hz. first 1,000\u20133,000 images were not used for reconstruction because too many fluorescent molecules were observed in them. the cells were washed sequentially with 4 SSC, 2 SSC containing 2 g/ml of RNase A, and 0.2 SSC. the cells were incubated for 2 h in a CO2-containing incubator. the cells were cultured under the same conditions as the parental cell line. confocal microscopy was performed using a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Nikon) with a CFI Apo Lambda S 60 objective lens (N.A. = 1.4, Olympus) super-resolution images were reconstructed using the built-in software program softWoRx. the DAPI signals that bled through the green and red channels were used as references to correct these aberrations. dSTORM images were obtained in wide-field mode with a DeltaVision OMX imaging system. the samples were illuminated with a 633-nm laser at maximum power. cDNAs representing the 5\u2032 of the BDV genome were amplified by PCR. in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase was performed to synthesize digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes according to manufacturer's instructions. cells were cultured on coverslips with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. antibody was used to detect nascent RNA signals. cells were incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h. dSTORM images were obtained in wide-field mode with a deltaVision OMX imaging system. the samples were illuminated with a 633-nm laser at maximum power, and 20,000\u2013. 30,000 images (256 256 pixels) were recorded at a frame rate of 33 Hz. first 1,000\u20133,000 images were not used for reconstruction because too many fluorescent molecules were observed in them. each peak was rendered as a Gaussian peak with its full width at a half-maximum of 30 nm. the cells were washed sequentially with 4 SSC, 2 SSC containing 2 g/ml of RNase A, and 0.2 SSC. the cells were incubated for 2 h in a CO2-containing incubator. an anti-digoxigenin-POD antibody was used to detect the nascent RNA signals. confocal microscopy was performed using an A1 confocal laser-scanning microscope (Nikon) with a CFI Apo Lambda S 60 objective lens (N.A. = 1.4, Olympus) super-resolution images were reconstructed by using the built-in software program softWoRx. dSTORM images were obtained in wide-field mode with a deltaVision OMX imaging system. the samples were illuminated with a 633-nm laser at maximum power. 20,000\u201330,000 images (256 256 pixels) were recorded at a frame rate of 33 Hz. the first 1,000\u20133,000 images were not used for reconstruction because too many fluorescent molecules were observed in them.
