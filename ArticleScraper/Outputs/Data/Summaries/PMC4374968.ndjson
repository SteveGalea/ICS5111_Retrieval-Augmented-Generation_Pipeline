{"summary": "rabies virus (RABV) has successfully adapted to terrestrial carnivores on multiple occasions. majority of rabies cases in humans are caused by bite of infected domestic dogs. but rabies can persist in both domestic dog and wildlife reservoirs. cost is incurred through necessity for provision of post-exposure prophylaxis and surveillance in rabies endemic areas. many countries in the Middle East collate and report human rabies cases. but routine surveillance and reporting of animal rabies is less systematic. there are multiple historical reports of disease consistent with rabies in the Middle East. endmic dog rabies had been almost eliminated from western Europe by the beginning of the 20th century. in the second half of the 20th century an epidemic of fox rabies spread through Europe, attributed to spill-over from dogs. in the Middle East rabies has been reported in foxes, but also in golden jackal and wolf (Canis aureus) a panel of 183 RABVs were selected for analysis from over 20 countries spanning the years between 1972 and 2014. samples were collected as part of routine rabies sampling. the majority of sequences will be from a laboratory-confirmed subset of ad-hoc reports of disease suspicion. PCR products were purified (QiaQuick PCR Purification kit, Qiagen) and sequenced using chain-termination (Sanger) sequencing (Big Dye Sequencing kit, ABI) at least one forward and one reverse primer were used to generate a consensus sequence for each virus. sequences were aligned using ClustalX2 (version 1.2) a strict molecular clock and Bayesian skyline population prior gave the lowest AICM. a neighbour joining tree was derived from p-distances with 1000 bootstrap replicates. a neighbour joining tree was derived from p-distances with 1000 bootstrap replicates. the maximum clade credibility tree was chosen using TreeAnnotator(v1.8.0) and visualised using FigTree (v1.2). posterior support is given at key nodes, and lineages are labelled according to previous studies [32] with the four main Middle East clades A-D labelled and coloured by region corresponding to Fig. 4. regional groupings for phylogeographic analyses COUNTRIES EUROPE Bosnia, Germany, Serbia, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Montenegro, Russia CAUCASUS Georgia, Azerbaijan IRAN Iran TURKEY Turkey \u2018MIDDLE EAST\u2019 Iraq, Jordan, Syria, Israel CENTRAL ASIA Mongolia, Kazakhstan ARABIAN PENINSULA Saudi Arabia, Oman, United Arab Emirates AFRICA South Africa, Tanzania, Guinea, Egypt, Morocco, Ivory Coast, Algeria AI for the null data set gives an indication of the strength of association between genetic and spatial information. low AI ratios imply a strong association between location and phylogenetic relationships. Branches are coloured by the most probable host species (dogs or wildlife) of the progeny node, with inset plots of relative probability at key nodes. approximate distribution of each detected RABV lineage is displayed using ArcGis (ESRI ArcGis version 10.0) RNA was quantified by spectrophotometer and a 582 base pair region of the nucleoprotein (N) gene amplified by reverse transcriptase chain reaction (hn-RTPCR) as described previously. a combination of smaller RT-PCRs were used to generate a contiguous 948 base pair region of the nucleoprotein (Vienna, primer sequences are available on request) Molecular clock and population coalescent models were compared using a modified Akaike information criterion (AICM) in Tracer v1.5. maximum clade credibility trees were annotated using TreeAnnotator (v1.8.0) after 10% of trees were discarded. a strict molecular clock and Bayesian skyline population prior gave the lowest AICM. MCMC chain length of 100 million iterations using 137 representative sequences in BEAST. maximum clade credibility tree was chosen using TreeAnnotator(v1.8.0) and visualised using FigTree (v1.2). the same nucleotide substitution (TN93+G+I), strict molecular clock and Bayesian skyline population coalescent models were used. probable locations of each ancestral node were then reconstructed in the ensuing Bayesian MCMC analysis. a null data set was created by randomisation of phylogeny and location data. an index of association between phylogeny and location in the observed data was compared to the equivalent from the null data set. the posterior set of trees produced by the Bayesian simulation was analysed with BaTS software. maximum clade credibility tree was annotated with TreeAnnotator (v1.8.0), visualised with FigTree (v1.4.0) and coloured by host species with the highest posterior probability. Branches are coloured by the most probable host species (dogs or wildlife) of the progeny node, with inset plots of relative probability at key nodes. only two sequences from Iran (\u2018DQ521212_sheep_iran_2000\u2019, \u201813158_Iran_wolf_1991\u2019) cluster with the Arctic-like lineage. none of the \u2018Cosmopolitan\u2019 viruses have been detected in Afghanistan and Pakistan. all the viruses from the Arabian Peninsula lie in this lineage, suggesting a single introduction of rabies into the Arabian Peninsula 40 years ago. the host analysis strongly supports this clade being predominantly in wildlife, again with multiple introductions into dogs. a third lineage appears to have been introduced into Turkey from Europe and maintained in Turkey with little evidence of trans-boundary movement for 50 years. phylogeographic analyses support introduction of the \u2018Cosmopolitan\u2019 lineage into Iran at least once. majority of virus sequences from Iran occur in this Cosmopolitan lineage. there are two sequences from Iran in the Arctic-like lineage. all other viruses from Israel and Jordan occur in clade B and appear to be introductions from Iran and the Arabian Peninsula. the host analysis and epidemiological data support the represented viruses from Israel and Jordan being largely wildlife derived. a symmetrical network was assumed in the BSSVS procedure. however, these strongly support the picture of spread of rabies from Europe, Iran and Turkey into the other regions of the Middle East. only two sequences from Iran cluster with the Arctic-like. the evolution and spread of rabies west of this apparent barrier at 60 degrees longitude is complex. four well supported clades (A, B, C and D in Figs. 1, 4) currently or recently circulating in the Middle East and surrounding countries. the first, clade A (Fig. 2), has an ancestor that occurred in Europe (location probability 91%) within the past 90 years (95% HPD 60\u201393), and has been introduced into the Caucasus region. clade includes dog and wildlife isolates interspersed within three well supported sub-clades. one of these sub-clades has an ancestral virus with a high probability of originating in a dog, but the host origin of the others shares approximately equal probability of originating in dog or wildlife. majority of represented strains from Iraq, including the most recent strains from Baghdad in 2011, are apparently due to incursion within the last 50 years. mopolitan\u2019 viruses have been detected in the Middle East and eastern Europe (\u2018Cosmopolitan\u2019 lineage\u2019) the evolution and spread of rabies west of this apparent barrier at 60 degrees longitude is complex. four well supported clades (A, B, C and D in Figs. 1, 4) currently or recently circulating in the Middle East and surrounding countries, which share a common ancestor predicted to have occurred 80\u2013127 years ago. the fourth lineage (Clade D, Fig. 2) has a well-supported ancestor that occurred in Iran or Turkey within the last 75 years. the majority of the represented strains from Iraq, including the most recent strains from Baghdad in 2011, are therefore apparently due to incursion within the last 50 years. the majority of viruses sampled in Iran were detected in wildlife or presumed spill-over hosts. the bulk of the viruses represented occur in one clade (clade C) but viruses from the other clades are circulating contemporaneously suggesting maintenance of distinct virus variants. the majority of the virus sequences from the Arabian Peninsula are from wildlife, as is the case for the rest of clade B. Caucasus (countries included: azerbaijan, Georgia) the majority of the virus sequences from the Arabian Peninsula are from wildlife, as is the case for the rest of clade B. Caucasus. the bulk of the viruses represented occur in one clade (clade C) but viruses from the other clades are circulating contemporaneously suggesting maintenance of distinct virus variants. a single exception in clade C is highly similar to a cluster of 18 viruses isolated in northern Israel between 2004 and 2006. the sample of RABVs showed a strong association between geographical origin and phylogenetic relationships (AI ratio 2.11/11.52), p0.01. Statistical support for migration events Inference of non-negligible rates of migration through Bayesian stochastic search variable selection procedure (BSSVS) detected seven events within the study region, with Bayes Factor support over 90. these include migration between the Caucasus and other regions (Iran, Europe and Central Asia), and migration between Turkey rabies continues to be a significant public and animal health issue in the region almost 4000 years later. estimates of the origin of all RABVs currently circulating in non-flying mammals are as recent as 1000 years ago. there is a clear and strongly supported distinction between those viruses circulating in Pakistan and Afghanistan and those further west. the east of Iran is much less densely populated than the west, with large tracts of uninhabited land. human movements are likely to play a role in the Middle East. human movements are likely to play a role in the region. rabies control is a critical question in rabies control in parts of africa. elimination of rabies in domestic dogs has led to the reduction of rabies in dogs. rabies in dogs are not as distinct as could be expected from this Western European experience. the large size and ferocity of rabid wolves may lead to a disproportionate number of people and domestic animals affected. however, the large size and ferocity of rabid wolves may lead to a disproportionate number of people and domestic animals affected, but also increase the likelihood of the event being detected and reported. phylogenetic tree of 171 rabies virus partial nucleoprotein gene sequences inferred using the same TN93 +G +I evolutionary model as used in the Bayesian analyses. the analysis was limited by available sequence length, with many of the sequences from historical samples having only a partial nucleoprotein gene sequence available. est-neighbour inference heuristic and 100 bootstrap replicates (MEGA6). bootstrap values are shown at selected key nodes."}
