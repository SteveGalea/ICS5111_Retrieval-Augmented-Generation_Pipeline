{"summary": "patient 1, who imported SARS from Hong Kong, was admitted on march 1 and isolated after 5 days. patient 2, a nurse who looked after patient 1, was initially misdiagnosed as having dengue and was isolated 3 days after her admission. from march 6 onwards, HCWs were using N95 masks, gowns, and gloves for personal protection when nursing patient 1 and any persons suspected of having SARS. serum samples were tested serologically for SARS-CoV total antibodies. the conjugate was goat antihuman immunoglobulin (Ig)A, IgG, and IgM conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. the specificity of our ELISA was 100%, as tested in 50 serum samples from patients admitted to a non-SARS hospital for illnesses other than respiratory problems. 105 asymptomatic HCWs were identified by the outbreak team. 98 (93%) consented to answer the questionnaires. 80 of these 98 (82%) also consented to have SARS serologic tests performed. the antibody titer for the asymptomatic cases was significantly lower than that for the pneumonic SARS cases. a higher proportion of those who had asymptomatic SARS (50%) had used masks compared to those in whom pneumonic SARS developed (8%) (p = 0.025) 0.025 21 (40) 0.002 No. who used gloves (%) 1 (17) 10 (26) >0.999 24 (46) 0.090 No. who washed hands (%) 4 (67) 29 (76) 0.63 47 (90) 0.110 No. who were close to a SARS patient (3 ft), % 5 (83) 35 (92) 0.456 48 (92) 0.747 Median contact time in minutes (range) 67.5 (10\u2013360) 60 (10\u2013480) 0.863 a large proportion of our cohort was in close, unprotected contact to SARS patients before infection control measures were in place. the extent of exposure in our cohort also contributed to the high attack rate that we observed (57%). a rate of 13% for asymptomatic SARS cases is lower than the rate of asymptomatic cases of many other viral respiratory diseases. the extent of exposure to SARS may have been lower, possibly resulting in a lower viral load of SARS-CoV, associated with less severe symptoms. a correlation with viral load and disease severity has been suggested (13); however, this hypothesis remains controversial as the development of severe respiratory distress is also thought to be due to an overwhelming immunologic response. asymptomatic SARS-CoV infection was associated with lower SARS antibody titers and better protective measures (masks) compared to pneumonic SARS."}
