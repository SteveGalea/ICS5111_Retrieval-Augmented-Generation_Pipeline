{"summary": "a global pandemic posed by outbreaks of influenza H5N1 (1997) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS, 2002) provoked interest in improving early warning systems. it led to the use of search query data from search engines such as google and Yahoo! as an indicator of when and where influenza was occurring. this methodology has subsequently been extended to other diseases and has led to experimentation with new types of social media for disease surveillance. social media and search behavior produce vast new data sources of largely untapped scientific potential. the threat of a global pandemic posed by outbreaks of influenza H5N1 (1997) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS, 2002), both diseases of zoonotic origin, provoked interest in improving early warning systems. the aim of this scoping review was to formally assess the current state of knowledge regarding the use of social media for disease surveillance. the review team consisted of all 6 co-authors with multidisciplinary expertise in epidemiology, infectious diseases, food safety and zoonoses, social media, and knowledge synthesis methods. search strategy was implemented in SciVerse Scopus (2002-2011) on august 16, 2011. the search strategy used a targeted combination of 17 social media and Internet-based tool terms (eg, blog, Internet), five disease terms (eg, outbreak), and five surveillance terms (eg, monitor). the search strategy was limited to 2002 and onward to coincide with the wide use of Web 2.0 applications. a priori developed data characterization and extraction form consisted of 20 closed (n=15 questions) and open (n=5) questions. the closed questions captured the article type and format, sector and targeted audience, definitions of social media and surveillance method description. conflicts between reviewers were resolved by consensus or with the assistance of the corresponding author, when required. thematic analysis was conducted by 2 independent reviewers (AR and IY) using an inductively developed form and code list (see Multimedia Appendix 1). the form and codes were informed by discussions from the workshop about the use of social media for disease surveillance and from reviewing a sample of five relevant articles. disease surveillance was defined as the ongoing systematic collection and analysis of data and the provision of information that leads to action being taken to prevent and control a disease [13]. Threats were limited to biological (viruses, parasites, bacteria, and their toxins) and chemical agents (melamine, pesticides) data characterization and extraction form was also pretested on five articles by 3 reviewers (TB, KR, and TB) a high agreement and only minor editorial discrepancies were observed for a couple of open-ended questions. the most practical yet robust data characterization and extraction process was determined. thematic analysis was conducted by 2 independent reviewers (AR and IY) using an inductively developed form and code list. the form and codes were informed by discussions from the workshop about the use of social media for disease surveillance. peer-reviewed journal article 29 90.6 Book chapter 1 3.1 Conference proceedings abstract 1 3.1 Year of publication

articles investigated social media in the context of foodborne disease or gastroenteritis (Table 1). none of the articles provided a definition for social media. two articles referred to the term \u201cinfodemiology\u201d which is defined as \u201cthe science of distribution and determinants of information in an electronic medium, specifically the Internet, or in a population\u201d [1]. thematic analysis Four thematic areas were identified as key characteristics of social media-based surveillance in the context of infectious disease. the first theme relates to the methodological aspects of the programs. the first theme relates to the methodological aspects of the programs. social media programs can allow international networks of food safety, public health, and other professionals to communicate via virtual networks. one example is virtual situation rooms using a three-dimensional interface, where public health professionals can collaborate and discuss surveillance data in real-time [15,21]. however, government and public health officials must be adequately trained and skilled in order to utilize these tools. 32 primary research articles and 19 reviews and case studies were identified as relevant. the full list of relevant articles from data characterization and extraction is available in Multimedia Appendix 1. dOther diseases included scarlet fever, tuberculosis, Lyme disease, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, chickenpox, and ophthalmologic conditions. most relevant citations were peer-reviewed journal articles published in 2010 and 2011. only four primary research articles investigated social media in the context of foodborne disease or gastroenteritis. the most commonly reported weaknesses were the potential for false positive (16/32, 50%) and false negative (11/32, 34%) results. most authors (24/32, 75%) recommended that social media programs should primarily be used to support existing surveillance programs. a variety of ontologies and search algorithms is used to synthesize and filter unstructured information from a variety of Web-based sources [15-21]. data sources can be characterized further as supply-based (eg, blogs and social media) or demand-based (eg, search behaviors) [18]. a second identified theme was the necessary capacity for developing these programs in practice. multiple challenges to the use of social media programs for infectious disease surveillance were identified. one of the most important challenges relates to the validity and reliability of the data analysis. several authors discussed the need to properly filter out background noise. the earliest article identified by this scoping review by Eysenbach [1] was published before search query data were widely available. he devised a clever method to circumvent this restriction and acquired data on searches related to influenza through a strategic combination of bids for targeted Google keywords and placement of an influenza-related advertisement. a model was created based on the top 45 queries most correlated with CDC data on influenza-like illness. it consistently estimated the level of weekly influenza activity in each region of the united states with a 1-day reporting lag, which was 1-2 weeks ahead of reports by the CDC\u2019s US Influenza Sentinel Provider Surveillance Network. 570 million tweets were analysed by Culotta (2010) [33]. researchers included geolocation as a possible use. the prevalence of tweets with geolocation data was only 2%. but city and state could be determined for 17% of user profiles. gomide et al proposed a method for dengue surveillance in Brazil. they looked at the proportion of tweets expressing personal experience with dengue. social media is a breakthrough technology because it reduces cost and difficulty of forming and working in groups. Detection and investigation of \u201crumors\u201d from news feeds and websites formed the basis of the Global Public Health Intelligence Network in 1997 [1,15] there is a growing body of evidence for the utility and accuracy of search queries in tracking diseases. the textual content of a tweet, however, differentiates it from search query data. newkirk et al [41] make the case for using real-time data from social media to bypass significant delays in traditional foodborne surveillance activities. newkirk et al [41] make the case for using real-time data from social media to bypass significant delays in traditional foodborne surveillance activities. earliest article identified by this scoping review by Eysenbach [1] was published before search query data were widely available. earliest article identified by this scoping review by Eysenbach [1] was published before search query data were widely available. a study by Polgreen et al found the frequency of searches for influenza had predictive potential in the united states. they were able to predict an increase in positive cultures for influenza 1-3 weeks before the increase occurred (P.001) and an increase in mortality attributable to pneumonia and influenza up to 5 weeks in advance (P.001) a study by Zhou et al used both Baidu search queries and Baidu news articles to track infectious diseases including dysentery. they were able to reduce the distorting effect of disease-related news reports by using a combination of search frequency data and news count data. they were published 10-40 days ahead of the release of official reports from the Chinese government CDC. two mapping systems were launched in 2006, BioCaster [16] and HealthMap [23] that monitor news feeds in multiple languages to provide real-time intelligence on emerging diseases around the world. healthMap currently invites user input on missing outbreaks and includes a feature that solicits user contributions on influenza illness symptoms. social media is a breakthrough technology because it reduces the cost and difficulty of forming and working in groups, making it possible for loosely affiliated people to accomplish things that once were only possible through formal organizations [40]. potential for Adoption Official reports by governments and international organizations were the primary source of disease intelligence during the 20th century. new developments in digital disease surveillance have the potential to improve sensitivity and specificity. most of the identified research to date is associated with using google search queries to detect seasonal or pandemic influenza days to weeks in advance of existing surveillance programs. but there are other promising areas for improvement. the growing evidence base regarding the utility of social media for disease surveillance will hopefully encourage academia, industry, the public service and international organizations to consider social media in a serious light. the primary challenge is to refine the data signal by reducing surrounding noise."}
