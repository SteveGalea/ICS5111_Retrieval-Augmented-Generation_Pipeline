{"summary": "a well-characterized laboratory strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV) can cause severe encephalomyelitis and demyelination in adult mice. central nervous system (CNS) infection with JHMV provides well-accepted models for (i) viral-induced encephalomyelitis, (ii) evaluating molecular and cellular mechanisms that oversee neuroinflammation. two sequential sections of paraffin-embedded brain from infected mice were probed with 35S-labeled antisense riboprobes. signal was detected by autoradiography after a 5-day exposure to film. GFAP-positive astrocyte (purple) cells express CXCL10 mRNA in the CNS of MHV-infected mice. persistent JHMV infection results in an immune-mediated demyelinating disease. viral titers within the CNS peak between 5 and 7 days p.i., and then decline below levels of detection as a result of infiltrating virus-specific T cells. administration of type I interferons impedes viral spread throughout the CNS. antiviral effector mechanisms associated with viral clearance within the CNS include the elevated expression of MHC class I and MHC class II on antigen-presenting cells. CD4+ T cells were depleted resulting in reduced CD8+ T cell expression of IFN- and granzyme B combined with elevated CD8+ T cell apoptosis (67). these findings support earlier studies (80,103), demonstrating that CD4+ T cells play a crucial role in both enhancing peripheral activation of CD8+ T cells and prolonging their antiviral function within the CNS. virus-specific Tregs dampen proliferation of virus-specific effector CD4+ T cells. depletion of Tregs increases mortality (2,102). a hallmark feature of JHMV infection of the CNS is viral spread into the spinal cord. electron microscopy reveals extensive loss of myelin sheath at (D) day 28 p.i. compared with (C) noninfected control mice in which thick myelin sheaths are present. axonal degeneration occurs in the ventral side of JHMV-infected mice (F) spinal cords when compared with control (E) spinal cords at day 7. fected mice are not the result of induction of an autoimmune response against neuroantigens. transfer of T cells from JHMV-infected animals into nave recipients results in demyelination (95) a recent report has suggested that infection with mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 promotes activation of autoreactive T cells specific to myelin basic protein. CD4+ T cells secrete the chemokine CCL5, a potent chemoattractant for inflammatory macrophages. Activated CD4+ T cells not specific to defined viral antigens have also been shown to contribute to demyelination in JHMV-infected mice. the chemokine CXCL10 and JHMV-induced Acute Encephalomyelitis Chemokines are divided into four subfamilies based upon the number and spacing of conserved cysteine residues present within the amino terminus of the protein. chemokines are now considered critical mediators of a variety of biological processes, including development, tissue homeostasis, and coordinated immune responses during viral infection. XC chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3) has been shown to influence migration/homing of macrophages, dendritic cells, NK cells, and activated T cell subsets to areas of inflammation. previously, numerous cytokines had been shown to be increased in response to CNS infection, yet it was unclear whether chemokines were expressed. the early expression of CXCL10 following CNS infection by JHMV argued for a potential role as a key sentinel molecule in host defense. the findings were further supported by subsequent studies employing JHMV infection of germline CXCL10/ mice (13) that resulted in decreased entry of IFN--positive T cells into the CNS and reduced ability for JHMV replication. a recombinant virus strain of MHV (MHV-CXCL10) was generated through targeted recombination using a reverse genetic approach (86) for both viruses, the exogenous gene was inserted into open reading frame (ORF4) of the MHV-A59 parental virus. MHV ORF4 encodes for a nonstructural protein that is not essential for growth in tissue culture or within the mouse CNS. CXCL10/ mice i.c. infected with MHV-CXCL10 exhibit 100% survival. only 60% of MHV-infected mice survive to day 12 p.i. expression of CXCL10 in noninfected tissues is important in host defense. transcripts in CXCL10/ mice infected with MHV-CXCL10 were selectively expressed in the CNS and liver. surprisingly, CXCL10/ mice infected with control virus showed reduced viral titers within the brains and livers. optive transfer of splenocytes from MHV-immunized CXCL10/ mice into MHV-infected RAG1/ mice resulted in T cell infiltration into the CNS, reduced viral burden, and demyelination comparable with RAG1/ recipients of immune CXCL10+/+ splenocytes. understanding how these cells migrate into the CNS is critical with regard to understanding host defense mechanisms associated with viral persistence within the CNS. mice were treated with anti-CXCL10 or control antisera beginning on day 12 p.i. to determine the role of CXCL10 in contributing to demyelination in mice persistently infected with MHV. blocking CXCL10, but not CXCL9, resulted in a dramatic reduction in clinical disease severity. anti-CXCL10-treated mice showed axons (a) within the ventral column with thin myelin sheaths surrounding axon (a) characteristic of remyelination. mice treated with control sera displayed numerous inflammatory foci and robust demyelination throughout the ventral, lateral, and dorsal columns. the reduction in demyelination correlated with reduced CD4+ T cell and macrophage infiltration. blocking CXCL10 signaling results in a reduction in white matter damage by specifically inhibiting CD4+ T cells gaining access to the CNS. overexpression of IFN- within the CNS of transgenic mice results in severe behavioral deficits associated with deleterious consequences on oligodendrocytes. these studies highlight the potential detrimental effect of sustained IFN- expression by inflammatory leukocytes infiltrating into the CNS. treatment of OPC cultures for 6 days with CXCL10 showed a significant increase (*p 0.05; ***p 0.0001) in TUNEL positive cells. treatment of OPC cultures for 6 days with CXCL10 (10 ng/mL) showed a significant increase (*p 0.05; ***p 0.0001) in TUNEL positive cells compared with untreated cultures. early expression of CXCL10 is beneficial as it serves to attract CXCR3-positive T cells into the CNS. sustained expression of CXCL10 also contributes to JHMV-induced demyelination through attraction of CD4+ T cells."}
