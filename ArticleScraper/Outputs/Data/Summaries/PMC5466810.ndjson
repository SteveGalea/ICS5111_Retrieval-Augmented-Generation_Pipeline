{"summary": "the neem (Azadirachta indica A. Juss.) showed potential inhibition of DENV-2 replication. a second DENV infection may lead a life-threatening dengue shock syndrome (DSS) f. septica burm. f. could be a potential medicinal plant against DENV. a pathogenic picornavirus causes gastroenteritis. the plants are Alisma orientalis (Sam.) Juz., Asparagus cochinchinensis (Lour.) Merr., Broussonetia papyrifera (Lour.) L\u2032Herit. ex Vent., Cinnamomum insulari-montanum Hayata, Cornus officinalis Torr. ex Dur., Euonymus japonicas Thunb., Elaeocarpus sylvestri plant extracts Materials of plant species were ground, extracted with the indicated solvent for one week. plant materials of the species no. 13 (leaves) were subjected to an additional one-step extraction with ethyl acetate (EtOAc) and filtered and dried. dilution doses of leaf methanol extract of F. septica (FS-(L)-M) for 1 h at room temperature. mixture of virus plus plant extract was then used to infect A549 cells. the viruses were propagated in mosquito cell line C6/36 (ATCC: CRL-1660) grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) the human Aichi virus (AiV) was isolated from a newborn with diarrhea in Taiwan. plant extracts Materials of the species no. 13 (leaves) were ground, extracted with the indicated solvent for one week. the extracts were concentrated under vacuum. cells were triedpsinized and resuspended in culture medium. cells were incubated with 10l WST-1 reagent for 2 h. cell viability was quantified by multi-well spectrophotometry. de for 30 min, then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min. cells infected with DENV or AiV were detected by antibody against NS3 or anti-AiV VP1 antibody. extracts from other 23 plants showed no cytotoxicity effect at the maximum tested concentration, 100 g/ml. IC50 of plant crude extracts against dengue virus type 2 infection. leaf extracts showed anti-DENV-2 effect, with IC50 from 3.05 0.75 to 37.46 12.3g/ml.

FS-(L)-M, 3.125 50g/ml, or DMSO solvent control (Ctrl) for 3 h before dengue virus type I and type II (DENV-1, DENV-2) and Aichi virus (AiV) infection at MOI = 2.5. after 2 h of virus adsorption and 42 h incubation, the immunofluorescence assay was performed to detect the viral infected cells. leaf methanol extract of Ficus septica inhibits enveloped viral infection. f. septica extracts had promising anti-DENV-1 and -DENV-2 effect. thus, F. septica would be a possible antiviral drug candidate against enveloped virus, such as DENV. ficuseptine, 4,6-bis-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1,2,3-trihydroindolizidinium chloride and antofine isolated from methanolic extracts of F. septica leaves showed strong antibacterial and antifungal activities. some alkaloids, including dehydrotylophorine, dehydroantofine and tylophoridicine, isolated from methanolic extracts of F. s cytotoxicity of plant crude extracts in A549 cells. click here for additional data file. authors declare there are no competing interests. ung-Hsien Chang conceived and designed the experiments, analyzed the data, wrote the paper, prepared figures and/or tables, reviewed drafts of the paper. raw data for Table 1, Figure 1 and Figure 2 has been supplied as Supplementary Files."}
