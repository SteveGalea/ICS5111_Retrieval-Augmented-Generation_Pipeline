{"summary": "the human coronaviruses (hCoV) 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1 are adapted to spread in the human population and circulate globally. these viruses cause the common cold, although immunocompromised patients and the elderly occasionally develop more severe disease. the emerging coronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) were relatively recently transmitted from bats expression of IFITM3 is essential for efficient control of influenza A virus (FLUAV) [23,24] and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [25] infection in mice. polymorphisms in the IFITM3 locus were found to be associated with the severity of influenza in humans. 293T cells were transduced with retroviral vectors bearing the hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza A virus (FLUAV), the glycoprotein of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G), the envelope protein (Env) of murine leukemia virus (MLV) or the MACV-GPC glycoproteins of Machupo virus (MACV-GPC) and Lassa virus (LASV-GPC) as expected lysates were determined by Western blot analysis, using a myc-specific antibody. expression of beta-actin was assessed as a loading control. similar results were obtained in an independent experiment. entry driven by IFITM3 was reduced to about 50% upon expression of IFITM2. we then analyzed the effects of an IFITM3-specific siRNA on S protein-mediated transduction. transfection of parental A549 control cells with IFITM3 siRNA significantly increased transduction efficiency compared to cells transfected with scrambled, control siRNA. transduction efficiency was determined at 72 h post inoculation by measuring luciferase activity in cell lysates. the average of three independent experiments carried out with triplicate samples is shown. entry driven by the S proteins of globally circulating and emerging coronaviruses is differentially susceptible to inhibition by IFITMs. however, entry into 293T cells driven by the S proteins of the globally circulating hCoV-NL63 and 229E and the emerging MERS-CoV was comparably inhibited by U18666A. inhibition of SARS-S-driven entry was most efficient (Figure 3A) clomiphene and terconazole reduced 293T cell entry driven by all coronavirus S proteins studied. the relative inhibition efficiencies did not correlate with the sensitivities to inhibition by IFITMs, which were measured in the same cellular system. to express the viral receptors were treated with the indicated concentrations of clomiphene (A) or terconazole (B), which increase endosomal cholesterol levels. entry driven by IFITM proteins is inhibited by IFITM proteins. despite high sensitivity to blockade by IFITM3, these observations identify MERS-CoV as a target for the antiviral activity of IFITM proteins. this suggests that modulation of endosomal cholesterol levels might not be the only mechanism by which IFITM proteins block viral entry. treatment can increase host cell entry of the human coronavirus OC43 in an IFITM2/3-dependent fashion [30]. entry into 293T cells driven by the S proteins of hCoV-NL63 and hCoV-229E was uniformly and efficiently inhibited by expression of all IFITM proteins. entry driven by the S proteins of the emerging coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV was only appreciably reduced by expression of IFIT a reduction of IFITM3 expression in 293T and A549 cells notably augmented entry driven by all S proteins examined. results suggest that human coronaviruses and emerging coronaviruses might be differentially susceptible to control by IFITM proteins. expression of IFITM proteins can inhibit the host cell entry of many enveloped viruses. 98.9% 0.4% inhibition at 5 g/mL U18666A, as expected. but not sensitive to inhibition by terconazole and clomiphene. the inhibitory activity of U18666A was not due to induction of cholesterol accumulation. Plasmids encoding viral envelope proteins from vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G), murine leukemia virus (MLV-Env), EBOV, Lassa virus (LASV-GPC), Machupo virus (MACV-GPC), influenza A virus (strain A/WSN/33 (FLUAV-HA)) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-S), human coronavirus NL63 (NL cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. membranes were blocked with 5% milk powder in PBS/0.1% Tween. expression of untagged IFITM proteins was analyzed using an antibody directed against the myc-tag [45] cells were seeded in T-25 cell culture flasks and then cotransfected with plasmids encoding for MLV gag-pol (3 g), a firefly-luciferase harboring MLV vector (6 g), and a plasmid encoding for the viral envelope protein (3 g). culture supernatants were harvested as described above, normalized for comparable transduction of untreated 293T cells. 293T cells transfected to express coronavirus receptors were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 104 cells per well. one hour before transduction the culture medium was removed and cells were treated with 50 L of DMEM containing twice the final inhibitor concentration or DMSO as control. luciferase activity in cell lysates were determined at 72 h post transduction. 30,000 Cos7 cells per well were seeded in 24-well-plates containing glass cover slides. cells were then fixed with 4% PFA for 1 h at room temperature. cells were then incubated in 50 g/mL filipin III (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h. cells were transfected with 1.2 pmol siRNA and 0.2 L Lipofectamine RNAiMAX per well. transduction with pseudotypes or Western blot analysis of IFITM3 expression was performed at 48 h after siRNA transfection. retroviral pQCXIP vectors for expression of IFITM1, 2 and 3 have also been described. cat gene was PCR amplified from pDM128-CMV [44] and cloned into pQCXIP-Cat. expression of untagged IFITM proteins was analyzed with an antibody directed against the myc-tag [45]. -actin antibody was detected with horseradish peroxidase-(HRP-)-conjugated secondary antibody (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) 293T cells were seeded in a T-75 cell culture flask at 60%\u201370% confluency and then cotransfected by calcium-phosphate-precipitation with plasmids encoding for MLV gag-pol (9 g), VSV-G (9 g) and pQCXIP preparations of IFITM encoding vectors were spinoculated [46] onto the cells by centrifugation at 4000 g for 30 min, followed by 48 h of incubation at 37 \u00b0C. thereafter, 50 L of supernatants containing infectivity normalized, luciferase encoding vectors bearing different viral envelope proteins were added. 293T cells were preincubated with a medium containing U18666A or DMSO at twice the final concentration. after 1 h the same volume of medium was added to reach the final inhibitor concentrations. the cells were then incubated for 8 h in the presence of the inhibitor. siRNA knockdown of IFITM3 expression was performed according to manufacturer\u2019s protocols. cells were then transfected with 1.2 pmol siRNA and 0.2 L Lipofectamine RNAiMAX per well. cellular entry driven by the S protein of the novel MERS-CoV is sensitive to inhibition by IFITM proteins.
