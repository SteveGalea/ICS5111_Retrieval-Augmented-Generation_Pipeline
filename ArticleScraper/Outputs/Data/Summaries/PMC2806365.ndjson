{"summary": "Backgrounds Urokinase (UK) 2 200 U/kgh for 12 hours infusion(UK-12 h) is an ACCP recommended regimen in treating acute pulmonary embolism (PE) it is unclear whether this dose and time can be reduced further. it is unclear whether this dose and time can be reduced further. reliable efficacy and safety, as well as the low cost have made UK a valuable agent in pulmonary embolism (PE) thrombolytic therapy. a loading dose of 4400 IU/kg followed by 2200 IU/kg/hour for 12 hours (UK-12 h) is recommended for acute PE treatment. a central steering committee was formed in charge of study design, protocol development and standardization. patients enrolled in the study were centrally randomly assigned to the treatment group with a standard computerized randomization program. the clinical information and images of each patient were reviewed independently by the members of the steering committee. a subcutaneous injection of low molecular weight heparin (nadroparin, 86 anti-factor Xa IU/kg) was given every 12 hours. nadroparin was stopped 4-5 days after warfarin was added. warfarin was continuously used for at least 3-6 months. subsequent doses were adjusted to maintain the INR at within 2.0-3.0 range. each anatomic segment of the lung was reviewed and the defect within each segment was scored according to the level of perfusion reduction. CTPA The location and severity of thrombus obstruction of the pulmonary vascular bed were reviewed and evaluated by helical CTPA score system described in previous studies. compared using chi-square test and Fisher's test. changes in the measurements of Echocardiograms, V/Q scan, and CTPA over time were analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance. subgroup analysis was also conducted base on the homodynamic status of massive PE. patients were excluded if they had received parenteral heparin for more than 72 hours or had thrombolytic contraindications. written informed consent was obtained from all the patients. right ventricular function was analyzed by the improvement of (1) right and left ventricular end-diastolic diameter ratio in the parasternal long-axis view. (2) right/left ventricular dimension ratio (RV/LV dimension); (3) estimated systolic pulmonary artery pressure (SPAP), in the absence of left ventricular disease or mitral valve disease as previously reported[10,11]. SPAP was 4 (VTR)2 + right atrial pressure (RAP) each anatomic segment of the lung was reviewed and the defect within each segment was scored according to the level of perfusion reduction. CTPA The location and severity of thrombus obstruction of the pulmonary vascular bed were reviewed and evaluated using the methods described previously. onset of thrombolysis with 80% power and a two-sided level of significance of 0.05, assuming a standard deviation of 10 points. a post hoc subgroup analysis was conducted base on the homodynamic status of massive PE. hypertension, n (%) 17(24.3) 18(31.0) Diabetes mellitus, n (%) 6(8.6) 4(6.9) COPD, n (%) 4(5.7) 5(8.6) Malignancy, n (%) 2(2.9) 3(5.2) Systolic blood pressure mean SD (mmHg) 80.9 12.3 74.2 13.9 PaO2 (mmHg) 72.9 20.3 70.8 16.5 PaCO2 (mmHg results were performed in 96 (74%) patients, 51 in the UK-12 h group and 45 in the UK-2 h group. both treatment groups showed significantly progressive improvements of right ventricular functions determined by all three measurements. no change 8(11.4) 8(13.6) 3(4.3) 2(3.4) Worse 12(17.1) 4(6.8) 3(4.3) 1(1.7) Any improvement = (significant + slight)/total, which indicates the percentage of overall improvement. comparison of adverse events during the first 14 days after treatment between the two treatments Adverse events UK-12 h(n = 70) UK-2 h(n = 59) P Death 1(1.4) 2(3.4) Due to PE 1(1.4) 1(1.7) 0.462 Due to Bleeding 0(0) 0(0) 0(0) Bleeding complications 10(14.3) 8(13.6) 0.332 Major bleeding 4(5.7) 6(10.2) Fatal bleeding 0(0) 0(0) 7.2 14.7 7.6 0.523 24 -hour 13.1 7.7 13.5 11.7 0.899 10.5 6.9 10.9 8.1 0.783 14- day 6.9 7.3 5.2 9.8 0.527 4.5 5.2 3.7 4.6 0.452 Adverse events Death 0 (0) 2 (10.0) 0.487 1(2)**** 0(0) 1.000 Due to PE 0(0) 1 (5.0)** 0(0) 0(0) 0(0) Recurrent PE 0 (0) 0 Baseline characteristics Characteristics UK-12 h (n = 70) UK-2 h (n = 59) Gender (male/female) 41/29 37/22 Age mean SD (y) 55.1 16.1 56.5 14.1 Weight mean SD (kg) 67.7 11.9 68.2 10.4 BMI mean SD(kg/m2) 24.4 4.2 24.6 3.5 Prior DVT or PE, n (%) 3(4.3) 5(8.6) CVD, n lic arterial pressure 90 mm Hg or a drop in systolic arterial pressure of at least 40 mm Hg for at least 15 minutes. pulmonary artery obstruction > 2 lobes on CTPA or >7 segments on V/Q scan combined with RVD and PH. the distributions of significant improvement, slight improvement, no change and worse were similar between the two treatments (Table 2). Table 2. Comparison of the pulmonary artery obstruction improvement scales between the two treatments 24 hour 14 day Qualitative Change UK-12 h (n = 70) only one patient with major bleeding episodes in UK 2 h group and one patient in UK 12 h group were directly associated with UK. no other episode of recurrent symptomatic PE was reported in either group. two treatments showed similar efficacy and safety in patients with massive pulmonary vascular obstruction combined with RVD. comparison of efficacy and adverse events between the two treatments in hemodynamically and anatomically massive PE. the patient died due to the commodities of acute myocardial infarction. study showed that the UK-2 h regimen exhibited similar efficacy as the UK-12 h regimen in PE thrombolytic therapy. the two regimens had similar bleeding incidences and death rates. subgroup analysis did not have enough power to draw conclusive data. however, future studies with anticoagulation control in patients with intermediate risk PE will be valuable to determine whether thrombolytic therapy is indeed beneficial in these patients. recurrence in our study was similarly low in both groups. one patient in the UK-12 h group died of recurrent PE at day 4 after initial treatment. study suggests a 2-h regimen of streptokinase can be routinely used in patients with massive PE and maintained cardiac output without obviously compromising efficacy or safety. thrombolytic therapy may be considered in selected patients with intermediate risk PE after thorough consideration of conditions increasing the risk of bleeding[3,27]. the subgroup analysis in our present paper was not pre-defined in the protocol. however, we did not have enough power to draw the conclusive data. future studies with anticoagulation control in patients with intermediate risk PE will be valuable to determine whether thrombolytic therapy is indeed beneficial. a patient in the UK-12 h group died of recurrent PE at day 4 after initial treatment. thrombolytic therapy may reduce the incidence of embolism. further studies with prolonged observation are desirable to compare the recurrence between these two different regimens. the study suggested that a 2-h regimen of streptokinase can be used in patients with massive PE. it showed similar efficacy and safety as the UK-12 h regimen in treating acute PE with either hemodynamic instability or massive pulmonary artery obstruction. the authors declare that they have no competing interests.
