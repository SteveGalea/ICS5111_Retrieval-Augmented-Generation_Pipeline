{"summary": "oral care gel, REFRECARE-H\u00ae, was applied as a thin layer on the oral membrane, after each meal and at bedtime for 30 days. VAS scores of dry mouth, breath odor, oral freshness, and sleep disorder were significantly increased 30 days after application of REFRECARE-H\u00ae (P = 0.01) HCV is the major cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Japan, with 70% of cases being HCV-related. the number of patients with HCV-related HCC is increasing worldwide. the visual analogue scale (VAS) is a simple and frequently used method for evaluating variations in pain intensity. we investigated the VAS and effects of REFRECARE-H\u00ae on patients with OLP associated with HCV-related liver disease. informed consent was obtained from each patient. a salivary flow rate 2 g/2 min was judged as decreased salivary secretion. the patients ranged in age from 55 to 76 years, with an average age of 67.9 7.6 years. the types of OLP included erosive (6 patients) and reticular (3). all patients were treated with topical administration of steroids. a salivary flow rate 2 g/2 min was judged as decreased salivary secretion. the patients marked on the line the point that they felt represented their perception of their current state. the VAS score was determined by measuring in millimeters from the left hand end of the line to the point that the patient had marked.

FN therapy for a maximum of 105 days should be managed by intensive oral care because of lower resistance to infection during the therapy. it is necessary for a hepatologist to educate patients regarding oral hygiene as well as provide treatment of liver disease."}
