{"summary": "the noninvasive imaging of atherosclerotic plaque progression and therapeutic response is very important. in atherosclerosis, macrophage accumulation initiates lesion development and triggers clinical events. however, conventional anatomic measurements of advanced lesions do not necessarily correlate with macrophage content. mannan\u2013dextran-coated USPIO (DM-USPIO) is prepared in-house by adding alkali-treated mannan to dextran-coated USPIO (D-USPIO), prepared in-house by adding alkali-treated mannan to dextran-coated USPIO. DM-USPIO is incorporated into the body\u2019s iron store and used in hemoglobin manufacture. the particle size of the D-USPIO used in this study is different from that of SPIO but its composition is similar. we prepared DM-USPIO by adding alkali-treated mannan to D-USPIO. the reaction mixture was subjected to centrifugation at 2500 g for 1 hour. the reaction mixture was then subjected to ultrafiltration (MWCO: 100,000) to obtain 1 L of DM-USPIO. each rabbit was 9\u201312 months old and weighed approximately 3 kg. all scans were obtained using a 1.5T MRI system, using a transmit-receive coil (Magnetom Sonata; Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany) the parameters used were: TR, 4.3 ms; TE, 1.7 ms; flip angle, 25\u00b0; field of view (FOV), 320 200 mm; matrix size, 512 320; and slice thickness, 1 mm. imaging was achieved using the three-dimensional (3D) first-spoiled GRASS protocol. parameters used were TR, 11.8 ms; TE, 4.1 ms; flip angle, 30\u00b0; FOV, 5 5 cm; matrix size, 512 512. two rabbits treated with either D- or DM-USPIO were the controls. the cells were stained with Prussian blue. the cells were stained with Prussian blue. we used SPSS for Windows software (SPSS Japan, Tokyo, Japan) for statistical analysis. differences in the uptake of D- and DM-USPIO in the arterial wall, in the uptake of iron by cultured macrophages, and in the SNR values from MRA scans obtained in vivo and in vitro were determined. 84 g of carboxydextran (molecular weight: 2500, approximately) was dissolved in 150 mL of water. reaction mixture was subjected to centrifugation at 2500 g for 1 hour. reaction mixture then subjected to ultrafiltration to obtain 500 mL of DM-USPIO. the rabbits were fully anesthetized with ketamine (Ketalar; Daiichi Sankyo, Tokyo, Japan), at 25 mg/kg body weight, and medetomidine (Domitor; Nippon Zenyaku Kogyo, Koriyama, Fukushima, Japan) for each MRI session, the rabbits were fully anesthetized with ketamine (Ketalar; Daiichi Sankyo, Tokyo, Japan), at in vitro MRI Of the twelve WHHL rabbits, ten were divided into two equal groups. ten were injected with D- or DM-USPIO at three different doses. the animals were euthanized 5 days post-injection. es immunohistochemically with RAM11 compared Prussian blue- and RAM11-stained areas. we measured the Prussian blue-stained area in one FOV (magnification, 200) in three different lesions for each histological section of the lower intrathoracic aorta. the amount of iron per unit weight (300 g) was measured by nuclear magnetic resonance. fetal calf serum supplemented with 10% bovine fetal calf serum by volume. mixed penicillin and streptomycin solution (Nacalai Tesque) the medium was replaced with fresh medium. s was significantly greater in rabbits treated with DM- rather than D-USPIO. in vivo MRI, the difference between pre- and post-administration SNR values was significantly greater than in those treated with D- or DM-USPIO. at dose 2 DM-USPIO, the SNRs obtained from three ROIs on three different aortic images were significantly lower than those of the rabbit treated with an equivalent dose of D-USPIO. at dose 1, there was no statistically significant difference (P > 0.1) iron uptake was dose-dependent in rabbits injected with either type of USPIO. iron uptake was significantly larger in rabbits treated with dose 3 DM- than in those treated with dose 3 D-USPIO (P 0.05). iron-positive areas were significantly larger in different sections of the aorta from the rabbit injected with DM- or DM-USPIO. at dose 3 (0.8 mmol Fe/Kg), the areas were significantly larger in different sections of the aorta. the values determined by Prussian blue staining in tissues of the spleen were 40,088 10,480 vs 43,607 9456 for D- and DM-USPIO, respectively. in the liver and lung, these values tended to be higher in DM- than D-USPIO-treated rabbits. the difference between the SNR obtained before and after the injection of nanoparticles was significantly greater in rabbits treated with DM- rather than D-USPIO. the difference between the SNR obtained before and after the injection of nanoparticles was significantly greater in rabbits treated with DM- rather than D-USPIO. in vitro MRI The aortic walls of the control animals were smooth. signal strength decreased in a dose-dependent fashion in rabbits injected with DM- or DM-USPIO. at dose 3, the SNR tended to be lower in rabbits injected with DM- or DM-USPIO (P 0.1) there was no significant difference at dose 1 (P > 0.1) in the rabbit treated with an equivalent dose of D-USPIO. iron uptake was dose-dependent (Figure 4). the Prussian blue-stained area increased in both the D- and DM-USPIO group in a dose-dependent manner. iron-positive areas were significantly larger in different sections of the aorta from the rabbit injected with DM- or DM-USPIO. there was no statistically significant difference in the biodistribution of D- and DM-USPIO in tissues from the spleen and kidney. the values determined by Prussian blue staining in tissues of the spleen were 40,088 10,480 vs 43,607 9456. both D- and DM-USPIO particles were phagocytosed by macrophages embedded in atherosclerotic plaques. this leads to a susceptibility-induced signal reduction in the atherosclerotic vessel wall on T1-weighted 3D gradient echo (GRE) images. this leads to a predominant T2/T2* shortening at higher concentrations. mannosylated liposomes target macrophages and dendritic cells for delivery of anti-inflammatory agent dexamethasone palmitate and the CpG DNA complex. mannosylation significantly improved liposome internalization by macrophages. the presence of activated M1 macrophages in atherosclerosis remains unknown. the distribution of DM-USPIO in the liver and lung tended to be higher than that of D-USPIO in these organs. this suggests that receptor-mediated endocytosis had a strong role in the internalization of DM-USPIO by macrophages. insufficient preparation of uniform homogenate samples may have impacted our NMR measurements. the number of rabbits was too small to confirm reproducibility of the observed aortic wall changes, and assessment of inter-individual differences was not possible. DM-USPIO is superior to D-USPIO for the study of atherosclerotic lesions."}
