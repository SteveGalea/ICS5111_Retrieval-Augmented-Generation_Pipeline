{"summary": "autophagy is a ubiquitous mechanism involved in the maintenance of homeostasis in response to cellular stress by recycling of long-lived proteins and cytoplasmic organelles. autophagy is a major component of the autophagosome, and its intracellular localization and conversion from the cytoplasmic form, LC3-I to its membrane-bound cleavage product, LC3-II. the signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM) is expressed on the surface of activated T and B lymphocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. CD46, a regulator of complement activation, is used only by attenuated and certain wild-type measles viruses (47) the CDV wild-type strain 5804P and its enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP)-expressing derivative 5804PeH were used in this study. the eGFP-expressing MeV vaccine strain Onderstepoort (OSeN) (34), the eGFP-expressing MeV wild-type strain IC323 (IC323-EGFP) (11, 35), and the MeV vaccine strain Moraten (MeVvacgreen) were used in this pCG-NiV and HeV glycoprotein expression plasmids pCG-NiV/F, pCG-NiV/attachment (G) protein, pCG-HeV/F, and pCG-HeV/G were provided by Bevan Sawatsky. the muV glycoprotein expression plasmids pCG-MuV/F and pCG-MuV/hemagglutinin-neuraminidase verodogSLAMtag cells were transfected with control or Atg7 siRNA 48 h previously or pretreated with chloroquine for 20 h. after 1 h, the viral inoculum was removed and cells were washed, triedpsinized, and mixed at a 1:16 ratio with verodogSLAMtag cells. lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes and blocked overnight at 4\u00b0C in 0.5% blocking reagent (Roche) bands were visualized either directly or washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Invitrogen), fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature, and then washed twice with PBS. fluorescent images were captured using either a standard fluorescence microscope or a confocal laser microscope (MRC 1000; Bio-Rad). all results shown represent the mean of at least three independent experiments. the virus was recovered as described previously (1, 28) all viruses were propagated in VerodogSLAMtag cells. cells were seeded at approximately 80% confluence in 12-well plates. titers were determined by limited dilution method. s targeting human Atg7 (116182, 116184, 173705) and negative-control siRNA (12935) were purchased from Invitrogen. protein knockdown was evaluated 48 h after siRNA transfection. next day, cells were treated with 50 M chloroquine or 10 mM 3-methyladenine (3-MA; Sigma) to inhibit autophagy. ing, the medium was removed and cells were overlaid with DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen) and 5% methylcellulose (Sigma) inactivation and stock titers were determined by parallel titration of UV and mock-inactivated samples. bands were visualized either directly or washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Invitrogen) cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 (Sigma) in PBS for 10 min, washed twice with PBS, and blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) in PBS. an increased number of GFP-LC3 puncta was found in rapamycin-treated positive-control and infected samples starting as early as 3 h and reaching a peak at 20 h after infection. confocal microscopy imaging revealed a colocalization of GFP-LC3 puncta with lysosomes in rapamycin-treated samples. the localization of autophagosomes is indicated by green puncta, and lysosomes are marked in red. for each sample, the total number of GFP-expressing foci and the number of foci with GFP puncta were counted in four separate fields. infection of GFP-LC3-expressing VerodogSLAMtag cells led to GFP-LC3 punctum formation in about 80% of GFP-LC3-expressing cells and syncytia. subsequent confocal microscopy analysis revealed that GFP-LC3 puncta did not colocalize with CDV replication complexes in infected cells. autophagy induction alone is not required for efficient replication. verodogSLAMtag cells were mock treated with 50 M chloroquine or with 10 mM 3-methyladenine for 20 h prior to infection with different CDV and MeV strains at an MOI of 0.01. twenty hours later, cell-associated virus titers were quantified and expressed as TCID50s/ml. infected foci and smaller syncytia were observed for atg7 siRNA- or chloroquine-pretreated cocultures. the distribution of endogenous LC3 in control siRNA-pretreated cells changed from a diffuse to a punctate cytoplasmic pattern. no relocalization was observed in Atg7 siRNA-pretreated cells. LC3 punctum formation in control or Atg7 siRNA-treated VerodogSLAMtag cells after inoculation with infectious or UV-treated CDV or MeV strains at an MOI of 2. three hours after infection, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained for endogenous LC3. LC3 puncta were visualized using fluorescence microscopy at a 1,000-fold magnification. GFP-LC3 was relocalized in puncta in 75% of rapamycin-treated cells. only 30% of GFP-positive cells displayed a punctum in mock-transfected samples. expression of the ER-retained F protein failed to induce autophagy. LC3-I and -II distribution in verodogSLAMtag cells transfected with meV Edm or CDV 5804P glycoprotein expression plasmids. a CDV F-protein expression plasmid carrying an ER retention signal was used to assess the importance of F-protein surface expression. 5804P glycoprotein-mediated fusion was SLAM dependent. a relocalization as puncta was observed in up to 85% of cells treated with rapamycin or transfected with the MeV Edm glycoproteins. error bars represent the standard deviation, and statistically significant differences are indicated by asterisks. all paramyxovirus glycoproteins induced syncytium formation. the observed membrane fusion-mediated autophagy induction may be common among viruses with fusogenic viral glycoproteins. the observed membrane fusion-mediated autophagy induction may be common among viruses with fusogenic viral glycoproteins. autophagy has been observed in the context of both meV and CDV infections (8, 14) but its role in the morbillivirus life cycle remains to be characterized. we first investigated the LC3 distribution in GFP-LC3-transfected cells at different times after infection with the CDV wild-type strain 5804P and the MeV vaccine strain MeVvac at an MOI of 0.01. analysis of verodogSLAMtag cells infected with a GFP-LC3 expression plasmid. cells were stained with Lysotracker red, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. results for the 20-h time point are shown. infection of GFP-LC3-expressing VerodogSLAMtag cells with SHmChL led to GFP-LC3 punctum formation in about 80% of GFP-LC3-expressing cells and syncytia. subsequent confocal microscopy analysis revealed that GFP-LC3 puncta did not colocalize with CDV replication complexes in infected cells. however, subsequent confocal microscopy analysis revealed that GFP-LC3 puncta did autophagy induction alone is not required for efficient morbillivirus replication. cells treated with autophagy inhibitors (A) or atg7-specific siRNAs (B and C) a marked reduction in the number of infected foci and smaller syncytia were observed for Atg7 siRNA- or chloroquine-pretreated cocultures. compared the distribution of endogenous LC3 in control and Atg7 siRNA-pretreated cells exposed to infectious or UV-inactivated viruses. LC3 punctum formation in control or Atg7 siRNA-treated VerodogSLAMtag cells after inoculation with infectious or UV-treated CDV or MeV strains. three hours after infection, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained for endogenous LC3. LC3 puncta were visualized using fluorescence microscopy at a 400-fold magnification after 20 h of incubation. coexpression of F and H proteins resulted in same punctate LC3 distribution pattern observed in rapamycin-treated cells. LC3 distribution in cells expressing only one of the glycoproteins remained unchanged. only 30% of GFP-positive cells displayed a punctum in mock-transfected samples. for each sample, the total number of GFP-expressing foci and the number of foci with GFP puncta were counted in four separate fields. errors represent the standard deviation, and statistically significant differences are indicated by asterisks. vaccine meV Edm glycoproteins resulted in syncytium formation in vero cells. wild-type CDV 5804P glycoprotein-mediated fusion was SLAM dependent. a statistically significant increase in LC3-II level was observed only in presence of syncytia. total number of GFP-expressing foci and number of foci with GFP puncta were counted in four separate fields. error bars represent the standard deviation, and statistically significant differences are indicated by asterisks. all paramyxovirus glycoproteins resulting in a statistically significant increase in LC3-II (Fig. 6B and C) the observed membrane fusion-mediated autophagy induction may be common among viruses with fusogenic viral glycoproteins. autophagy plays an important role in cellular homeostasis, cell survival under stress conditions, and cellular defense against pathogens (21, 29). however, an increasing number of viruses have been recognized to use autophagy pathways to their own benefit (6, 49) a rapid redistribution of LC3 in a punctate cytoplasmic pattern and a corresponding increase in LC3-II indicates that autophagic processes are triggered by virus-cell or cell-cell fusion. however, autophagy induction alone was not required for efficient replication, as illustrated by similar cell-associated virus titers obtained in control and Atg7-knockdown cells. fusion-mediated autophagy induction may be a widespread phenomenon. a similar mechanism may also be involved in morbillivirus leukopenia and immunosuppression. further investigations in immune cells will be needed to confirm dual role of autophagy in morbillivirus pathogenesis. a rapid redistribution of LC3 in a punctate cytoplasmic pattern and a corresponding increase in LC3-II indicates that autophagic processes are triggered by virus-cell or cell-cell fusion. however, autophagy induction alone was not required for efficient replication, as illustrated by similar cell-associated virus titers obtained in control and Atg7-knockdown cells. protein gp41 induces autophagy in bystander CD4+ T lymphocytes through contact with CXCR4 and subsequent fusion (3). this facilitates efficient infection of or initiates apoptosis in these bystander cells. similar mechanism may also be involved in morbillivirus leukopenia and immunosuppression. induction."}
