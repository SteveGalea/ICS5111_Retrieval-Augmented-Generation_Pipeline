{"summary": "EBOV tropism toward antigen-presenting cells is thought to play an important role in viral pathogenesis. EBOV productively infects APCs, including monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs), in vitro (3\u20139) and tissue sections from EBOV-infected humans and nonhuman primates contain APCs positive for EBOV antigen/nucleic acid. additional host factors have also been implicated as regulating entry. this includes components of the homotypic fusion and vacuole protein-sorting complex. s are nonpermissive for EBOV GP-mediated entry unless differentiated into macrophage-like cells. cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% l-glutamine. plasmids used in transfections included pcDNA BLA-VP40, which expresses a -lactamase-Zaire EBOV VP40 chimera. monocytes were plated (0.7 106 to 1 106 cells/ml) in DC medium. they were plated with 100 U of penicillin/ml, 10 g of streptomycin/ml. the 293T cell spent supernatant was layered over 10 ml of 20% sucrose in NTE buffer (100 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-hydrochloride [pH 7.5] and 1 mM EDTA [EDTA]) the VLPs were finally resuspended in a total of 150 l of NTE and stored on ice at 4\u00b0C. titers were determined using an agarose plaque assay. agarose cells were plated in six-well plates to 90 to 100% confluence. fivefold dilutions of stock virus were prepared. d (spinoculated) at 1,850 rpm for 45 min at 4\u00b0C before incubation at 37\u00b0C in 2% RPMI medium for the indicated times. an LSR II (BD Bioscience) flow cytometer equipped with a violet laser was used to excite the CCF2-AM substrate. events were assayed for green and blue fluorescence after sorting for live cells. day 3 spent supernatants from infected and noninfected control cells were analyzed. total RNA was harvested using Tri-Reagent, which was added to each well containing (infected) cells. cDNA was extracted from the aqueous phase of the Tri-Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) samples using an RNeasy micro kit.

RESULTS EBOV GP-mediated entry into monocytes is restricted. several published studies report the productive replication of EBOV in primary human monocytes. monocytes, macrophages, and human monocytes previously cultured for 5 days in the presence of M-CSF, M-CSF+ IL-4, M-CSF + TGF- (TGF-b), GM-CSF+ IL-4, GM-CSF + TGF- (TGF-b), GM-CSF + IFN- (IFN-g) (E) we first tested whether EBOV VLP entry into freshly isolated undifferentiated mon monocytes are typically differentiated into immature DCs by incubation with GM-CSF plus IL-4 (54) for 5 to 7 days (50, 51, 55, 56), therefore, we treated monocytes with these cytokines for periods of 0, 18, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h before testing for entry. at 18 h after cytokine treatment, 10% of the monocytes permitted entry. freshly isolated blood monocytes were cultured in the presence of GM-CSF+IL-4 for 0, 18, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h. EBOV titers were determined on veroE6 cells. cells were harvested at day 2 (C) and day 3 (D) postinfection. monocytes become permissive for EBOV entry in the absence of supplemental cytokines. freshly plated and cultured ex vivo monocytes slowly and spontaneously differentiate (65\u201367) therefore, monocytes become permissive for EBOV entry as they differentiate. s were incubated together for 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h before testing for penetration into the cytoplasm. freshly isolated monocytes, 24-h-cultured monocytes and differentiated DCs were stained with antibodies against CD1c, CD14, ICAM-1, and CD44. the cells were then harvested and tested for penetration into the cytoplasm. undifferentiated THP-1 cells were permissive for entry by VSV G, but not by EBOV GP VLPs. only expression of ICAM-1, previously shown to be upregulated on monocytes cultured for several days, was significantly upregulated on PMA-treated THP-1 cells. we also tested whether a 24-h incubation with VLPs would rescue EBOV GP-mediated entry into THP-1 cells and included primary monocytes as a positive control. GP-F159A mutants were previously shown to be entry defective. GP-F159A VLPs were used in entry assays to exclude the possibility that differentiated monocytes or THP-1 cells might indiscriminately take up any GP-expressing VLPs. EBOV transcription is delayed in monocytes compared to DCs. previous studies have shown that EBOV productively infects monocytes. RNA was harvested from cells grown in medium supplemented with PMA. poly(A)-derived cDNA was used as a template for quantitative RT-PCR analysis of EBOV nucleoprotein (NP) mRNA. EBOV GP VLPGFPs (green) were incubated with monocytes for 0, 1.5, and 4 h before fixation. cells were stained (red) using wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to a fluorochrome. monocytes secrete limited levels of cytokines upon EBOV infection. a multiplex assay was performed on supernatants harvested 3 days after EBOV infection of monocytes, macrophages, and DCs. PBMCs, monocytes, macrophages, or DCs were mock infected with EBOV at MOI of 5. concentrations of IL-12, IL-6, IL-8, MIP-1, MCP-1, RANTES, IFN-, IP-10, and G-CSF were determined by using a human 30-plex cytokine assay. expression levels of host factors critical for entry change during monocyte differentiation and EBOV infection. EBOV infection hastens downregulation of entry restriction factors. mRNA levels of EBOV entry factors were assayed for monocytes. lower levels of mRNA correspond to lower levels NPC1 protein expression in monocytes and higher levels in DCs and macrophages. overexpressing NPC1 partly rescued EBOV GP-mediated entry. this suggests low levels of NPC1 in monocytes may determine resistance to EBOV entry. VLPs pseudotyped with either EBOV GP or control VSV glycoprotein (VSV-G) are incubated with a target cell for a defined period of time after which entry is assayed. successful entry results in the delivery of -lactamase into the target cell cytoplasm where it cleaves a preloaded cytosolic fluorescent substrate. we first tested whether EBOV VLP entry into undifferentiated monocytes was restricted compared to macrophages and DCs that were differentiated from M-CSF or GM-CSF+IL-4 cytokine-treated monocytes. EBOV GP-mediated entry was restricted in human (Fig. 1B and D) and mouse (Fig. 1C) monocytes. monocytes are typically differentiated into immature DCs by incubation with GM-CSF plus IL-4 (54) for 5 to 7 days. at 18 h after cytokine treatment, 10% of the monocytes permitted entry. increased EBOV GP-mediated entry efficiency was associated with increased duration of cytokine exposure. EBOV infection of monocytes is delayed compared to DCs. a recombinant EBOV expressing GFP was used to test infection efficiency in monocytes and DCs. at 48 h postinfection, there was an 3-fold difference in the number of GFP+ monocytes and DCs. this difference was no longer apparent by 72 h postinfection. VLPs were incubated with target cells for 3.5 h before testing for cytoplasmic penetration. at 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after the addition of VLPs, monocytes and DCs were tested for entry. however, monocytes never achieved the same level of infection as the DCs. antibodies against CD1c, CD14, ICAM-1, and CD44 compared to background staining. no significant differences in expression levels on freshly isolated monocytes compared to monocytes cultured for 24 h of any of the markers tested. only expression of ICAM-1, previously shown to be upregulated on monocytes cultured for several days, was significantly upregulated on PMA-treated THP-1 cells. the combination of significant ICAM-1 expression and adherence suggests that the THP-1 cells have differentiated into a macrophage-like cell. we tested whether a 24-h incubation with VLPs would rescue EBOV GP-mediated entry into THP-1 cells. an increased VLP-cell incubation time in blood monocytes but not in THP-1 cells eventually allows EBOV GP entry. THP-1 cells allow EBOV GP mediated entry only in the presence of PMA. thus, entry into monocytes correlate with differentiation. viral nucleoprotein (NP) mRNA levels were measured at 0, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after EBOV infection. EBOV infection, like EBOV VLP entry, is delayed in undifferentiated monocytes compared to differentiated cells. RNA was harvested from cells at 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 postinfection. the percentages of EBOV GP VLPGFPs were scored as entering beyond the cell periphery (taken up) by monocytes if the VLP was inside the cell and not associated with the membrane. totals of 39, 351, and 21 VLPs were scored at time points 0, 1.5, and 4 h. a multiplex assay was performed on supernatants harvested 3 days after EBOV infection of monocytes, macrophages, and DCs. to test for the presence and levels of several inflammatory cytokines, a representative panel of secreted cytokines is presented in Fig. 6. the relative mRNA levels of select host entry factors were compared by quantitative RT-PCR between undifferentiated monocytes and DCs. of the mRNAs examined, only the mRNA levels of cathepsin B, NPC1, IFITM1 and IFITM3 showed a >10-fold difference between monocytes and DCs. monocytes > DCs AXL Monocytes > DCs ITGB1 Similar LSECTin ND L-SIGN ND DC-SIGN Similar Located intracellularly NPC1 Monocytes DCs* VPS33A Similar VPS11 Similar VPS18 Similar GNPTAB Monocytes > DCs Cat B Monocytes DCs* IFITM1 Monocytes > DCs* IFITM2 Monocytes > DCs IFITM3 Monocytes > DC monocytes are productively infected by EBOV but are nonpermissive for EBOV GP-mediated entry (4, 20\u201323) overexpressing NPC1 partly rescued EBOV GP-mediated entry. studies with infectious EBOV suggest that monocytes are not incompetent for EBOV entry. however, entry is substantially delayed and somewhat less efficient compared to DCs. primary monocytes spontaneously differentiate in culture. a dramatic downregulation of the mRNA for each of these proteins was accelerated in EBOV-infected monocytes. however, essential entry factors cathepsin B and NPC1 are dramatically upregulated during monocyte differentiation. if NPC1 facilitates entry directly, by acting as a receptor, or by some indirect mechanism remains to be determined. previous studies implicated cell adherence versus nonadherence as a determinant of EBOV entry into THP-1 and 293 cells. adherence correlates with the translocation of an RBD binding activity from an intracellular compartment to the cell surface. there are multiple potential consequences for the delayed entry of EBOV into monocytes. EBOV infection appears to accelerate transcriptional regulation of entry-relevant host factors compared to uninfected, plated monocytes. EBOV can trigger signaling in macrophages within 1 h postinfection. EBOV VLPs stimulate APCs in a GP-dependent manner."}
