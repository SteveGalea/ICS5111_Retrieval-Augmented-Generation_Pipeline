{"summary": "human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections and is a major cause for hospitalization of infants in the first year of life. re-infection occurs frequently and sterilizing immunity is never firmly established. a successful RSV vaccine should induce protective immunity, but no immunopathology. the fusion protein is a type I membrane protein that is synthesized as an inactive precursor protein (F0) that assembles into trimers (reviewed by [1]. the F protein appears to be a more efficient neutralizing and protective antigen compared to G [5], which may shield the protein from immune recognition [6], [7]. the structure of the F protein in its postfusion conformation has recently been elucidated [19], [20]. we made use of innovative immunostimulatory carriers that consist of peptidoglycan spheres produced from the food-grade bacterium Lactococcus lactis. the bacterium is killed at low pH and high temperature, which generates bacterium-like particles (BLPs) that are non-living and deprived of intact surface proteins and intracellular content. recombinant soluble variants fused to a peptidoglycan binding moiety. different variants of F were analyzed with respect to their conformation and reactivity with neutralizing antibodies. antibody specific for the prefusion form of F account for most of the neutralizing activity found in human sera [29] one cDNA clone encodes the wild-type F protein ectodomain. the other clone encodes a F protein ectodomain in which the arginine residues in the two multibasic furin cleavage sites are mutated into lysines. each cDNA was cloned into the pCD5 expression vector for efficient expression in mammalian cells. RSV F proteins lacking the transmembrane domain (TM) and cytoplasmic tail (CT) were genetically fused to a CD5 signal peptide (CD5) and to a carboxy-terminal tag (tag) the tag either consisted of a triple Strep-tagII, a LysM peptidoglycan binding domain, or of a combination of the two. the concentration of Strep-tactin purified protein was determined by using a nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer. antibodies secreted in the cell culture supernatant were bound to protein A sepharose beads (GE Healthcare), after which they were eluted using 0.1 M citric acid pH 3.0. the eluates were immediately neutralized using 1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.8. TPCK treated trypsin (0.04\u20130.005 g range per 10 l reaction volume) from bovine pancreas (Sigma) for 30 min at 23\u00b0C. protein bands were visualized by using a Colloidal Blue Staining kit (Invitrogen) cells of an overnight culture of L. lactis strain MG1363acmA1 were harvested and washed once with sterile distilled water. the cells were resuspended in 10% trichloroacetic acid and placed in a hot water bath of 99\u00b0C for 30 min. the acid and heat treatment kills the bacteria and generates the so-called BLPs. group 1 and 2 were vaccinated intranasally with either 10 g Flys-GCN with a C terminal LysM domain bound to 0.3 mg BLPs. group 3 received formaldehyde inactivated RSV (FI-RSV) 4 weeks after the second booster vaccination, blood samples were drawn by orbital puncture. eighteen balb/c mice (6\u20138 weeks) were immunized with prime vaccination on day 0, and a booster on day 28. group 1 and 2 were (mock-)vaccinated intranasally with either PBS (group 1, mock; 10 l per dose), or BLP-F (group 2, 10 g Flys-GCN bound to 0.5 mg of BLP per 10 l dose) group 1 and 2 were (mock-)vaccinated intranasally with either PBS (group 1, mock; 25 l per dose), or BLP-F (25 g Flys-GCN bound to 1.25 mg of BLP per 25 l dose) group 3 received FI-RSV (1/100 diluted, 50 l per dose; prepared according to [36] in both their quadriceps equally divided over both injection sites. mouse IgG (Sigma) diluted in triplicate (first well 0.5 g/ml) was used to generate a calibration curve. plates were incubated for 1.5 hrs at 4\u00b0C, followed by 3 washing steps. plates were incubated with appropriate conjugate (anti-mouse IgG, IgG1 or IgG2A conjugated with HRP, Southern Biotech, USA) cells were overlayed with 0.75% methylcellulose medium. plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 incubator. cells were fixed with 0.1% crystal violet stain for one hour, then rinsed, and air dried. fluent HEp-2 monolayers infected with 50 l per well starting with undiluted samples followed by diluted homogenates in 24-well plates. after 4 days of incubation the inocula were removed and the cells were fixed with 0.1% crystal violet stain for one hour, then rinsed, and air dried. virus titers are expressed as pfu per gram of tissue. the study was carried out in strict accordance with the guidelines provided by the Dutch Animal Protection Act or National Institutes of Health. one cDNA clone encodes the wild-type F protein ectodomain, the other encodes a F protein ectodomain in which the arginine residues in the two multibasic furin cleavage sites are mutated into lysines. codon-optimized DNA fragments encoding the variable heavy and light chains of antibody D25 [34] and AM22 [35] were synthesized by GenScript USA Inc. pCAGGS mammalian expression vectors containing human IgG1 heavy and light constant domains were cloned in-frame into pCAGGS mammalian expression vectors. antibodies secreted in the cell culture supernatant were bound to protein A sepharose beads (GE Healthcare), after which they were eluted using 0.1 M citric acid pH 3.0. anti-Strep-tag antibody conjugated with horse radish peroxidase (HRP), palivizumab (Synagis, Abbott Laboratories) followed by HRP-conjugated anti-human IgG antibody. samples were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer (LSB) they either did or did not contain 5% 2-mercaptoethanol (ME; Sigma), and heated at 96\u00b0C for 5\u201315 minutes when indicated. protein bands were visualized by using a Colloidal Blue Staining kit (Invitrogen) Detection of HRP reactivity was performed using tetramethylbenzidine substrate (BioFX) and a ELISA plate reader (EL-808 from Biotek) all experiments were repeated 2\u20133 times. all animals were immunized with prime vaccination on day 0, a booster vaccination on day 10 and a second booster on day 20. group 1 and 2 were vaccinated intranasally with either 10 g Flys-GCN with a C terminal LysM domain bound to 0.3 mg BLPs (10 l per dose) the stock of virus is stored at 80\u00b0C and has been characterized in vivo using the cotton rat model for replication of RSV in the upper and lower respiratory tract. eighteen Balb/c mice (6\u20138 weeks) were purchased from Harlan (USA) and maintained and handled underveterinary supervision. Sigmodon hispidus cotton rats were immunized with prime vaccination on day 0, and a booster on day 28. group 1 and 2 were (mock-)vaccinated intranasally with either PBS (group 1, mock; 25 l per dose), or BLP-F (25 g Flys-GCN bound to 1.25 mg of BLP per 25 l dose) the plates were blocked with blocking buffer (50 mM carbonate-bicarbonate pH 9.7 with 2,5% Protifar\u00ae plus w/w) samples were applied to the plates in serial triple-fold dilutions using a multichannel pipette. a mouse control serum sample, positive for RSV F was included in each plate. heat inactivated serum samples were incubated with EMEM for 1 hour. cells were inoculated onto confluent HEp-2 monolayers in 24-well plates. cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 incubator. the amount of infection was calculated by determining the total area of infected cells using imageJ. the neutralizing titers were determined at the 50% reduction point of the virus control. the per protocol (PP) population was defined as all subjects who received the full amount of treatments and had blood drawn for serology testing on indicated days. the difference between BLP-F and the other groups present in the experiment was assessed. signal peptide-encoding sequence followed by sequences coding for the GCN4 isoleucine zipper trimerization motif. the tags consisted either of a triple Strep-tag (ST3) for easy purification, a LysM peptidoglycan binding domain [21] for binding of the F proteins to BLPs. for yet unknown reasons, GCN4-containing F constructs were expressed to higher levels when also the LysM domain was present. the cleaved and non-cleaved proteins migrated with different electrophoretic mobilities corresponding to the absence or presence of the GCN4-LysM sequence. the majority of the F proteins migrated at a much higher position in the gel when the furin-cleavage sites had been mutated. soluble, cleaved F ectodomains adopt a stable postfusion conformation. the stable postfusion form of F is not formed, however, when the F proteins are not cleaved. western blot analysis of recombinant F proteins. treatment of the non-cleaved F proteins (Flys and Flys-GCN) with trypsin resulted in the appearance of F proteins migrating at a much higher position in the gel. the formation of the SDS-resistant higher-order structures was more apparent for Flys than for Flys-GCN, indicative of the formation of the putative postfusion conformation being impaired. F proteins were subsequently analyzed by SDS-PAGE using non-reducing conditions. Fwt and Flys contain a C-terminal LysM domain and ST3 tag. the size of the molecular mass markers is shown on the left of each panel. trypsin treatment of Flys and Flys-GCN resulted in reduced AM22 reactivity. reactivity of Palivizumab with the F proteins was not affected by trypsin treatment. reactivity of D25 with different F protein preparations was similar to that of AM22. Binding of the antibodies was detected using HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. Fwt-GCN and Flys-GCN contain a C-terminal LysM domain and ST3 tag. in contrast to the BLPs carrying Flys-GCN, the BLPs displaying Fwt-GCN aggregated. this result is in agreement with the Fwt-GCN protein adopting a postfusion conformation. the hydrophobic fusion peptide becomes exposed, which results in aggregation of the F protein-bound BLPs. mice were immunized three times either intranasally with BLP-F or with unadjuvanted Flys-GCN protein. mice were also immunized three times intranasally with unadjuvanted Flys-GCN protein or intramuscularly with FI-RSV. all vaccinated animals displayed F-specific IgG levels. samples were taken 28 days after the last vaccination. juvanted flys-GCN4 or intramuscularly with FI-RSV. results indicate that BLP-F is able to induce protective immunity. intranasally is capable of inducing protective immunity in mice. pulmonary histopathology examination showed no scores of interstitial pneumonia and alveolitis in the mice vaccinated with BLP-F. as expected high levels were scored in lungs of animals vaccinated with FI-RSV. cotton rats were vaccinated intranasally with BLP-F or with FI-RSV. only the cotton rats showed detectable and high virus neutralization titers. the virus neutralization titers plateaued after the first boost prime-boost vaccination. titers in cotton rat sera before (day 0), 1 (14 days), 2 (28 days) and 3 (42 days) immunizations. limit of detection is 200 pfu/gr. interstitial pneumonia and alveolitis were scored. based on recombinant soluble F protein ectodomains bound to the surface of the immunostimulatory BLPs. previously, others have shown that expression of fully cleaved, soluble F protein gives rise to multimeric forms that are either in the postfusion conformation [18], [37], [38] or in a pre-triggered state that easily adopts a postfusion conformation. inhibition of the furin-cleavage of F appears to prevent the protein from peptidoglycan binding domain [21] for binding of the F proteins was expressed to higher levels when also the LysM domain was present. expression vectors encoding F proteins with non-modified furin-cleavage sites were achieved by transfection of the expression plasmids into HEK293T cells. expression vectors encoding F proteins with modified furin-cleavage sites were substituted by lysines (Flys and Flys-GCN) the migration of the non-cleaved F proteins did not appear to be much affected. the difference in electrophoretic mobility between the cleaved and non-cleaved proteins was most likely explained by the dissociation of the glycosylated p27 sequence [18] from the cleaved proteins. ation is not prevented when the ectodomain is extended with an artificial trimerization domain. the stable postfusion form of F is not formed when the F proteins are not cleaved. treatment of the non-cleaved F proteins (Flys and Flys-GCN) with trypsin resulted in the appearance of F proteins migrating at a much higher position in the gel under non-reducing conditions. the formation of the SDS-resistant higher-order structures was more apparent for Flys than for Flys-GCN. MAbs Palivizumab, AM22 and D25, although specific for RSV F, were previously shown to exhibit very little reactivity to cleaved, soluble F protein ectodomains. however, intermediate binding was observed when the cleaved protein was extended with the trimerization motif (Fwt-GCN) Fwt, which presumably adopts the postfusion conformation, is least detected by AM22 and D25, while the highest reactivity was observed for Flys-GCN. reactivity of recombinant F proteins with neutralizing antibodies was analyzed. infectivity is graphed. the error bars indicate the standard deviations. the binding of recombinant soluble RSV F proteins to the BLPs. the amount of F protein bound to the BLPs was determined by incubation of an equal amount (28 g) of the F proteins with 1 mg of BLPs using standard conditions. the amount of F protein bound to the BLPs was determined by comparative SDS-PAGE analysis. mice were immunized three times either intranasally with BLP-F or with unadjuvanted Flys-GCN4 or intramuscularly with FI-RSV. the highest levels (15\u201324 fold higher) were observed for the animals vaccinated with BLP-F. no such antibodies were observed after immunization with \u201cempty\u201d BLPs. the error bars indicate the number of responders per group. mice were vaccinated three times intranasally with BLP-F. animals (mock-)vaccinated with PBS or FI-RSV (intramuscularly) were included as controls. cotton rats were (mock-)vaccinated intranasally with BLP-F or with PBS, or were vaccinated intramuscularly with FI-RSV. only the mock-vaccinated cotton rats were vaccinated intranasally with BLP-F or with FI-RSV. the virus neutralization titers plateaued after the first boost prime-boost vaccination. fourteen days after the last vaccination, the cotton rats were challenged with RSV/A/Long (106 pfu) at day 5 post challenge, the animals were euthanized and viral titers in the lungs were determined. 2 weeks after each immunization the lungs were harvested for pulmonary histopathology examination. interstitial pneumonia and alveolitis were scored as described in the Materials and Methods. the group receiving BLP-F was compared with the other groups using a Mann-Whitney U test. intranasal vaccination of mice or cotton rats with BLPs loaded with these recombinant F proteins (BLP-F) induced high RSV F-specific IgG and SIgA levels and significantly decreased RSV titers in the lung upon RSV challenge. different recombinant soluble F protein preparations were analyzed in this study. s carrying Fwt-GCN were found to aggregate, which can be attributed to the hydrophobic interactions between fusion peptides exposed in the postfusion conformation. the ability of the majority of Fwt-GCN to adopt the postfusion conformation is remarkable as the addition of the GCN4 trimerization motif to several other class I fusion proteins was sufficient to keep these proteins in the prefusion conformation. non-cleaved F proteins do not form rosettes that result from hydrophobic interactions between the fusion peptides. however, the F proteins of two other paramyxoviruses (PIV3 and PIV5) were shown to adopt a postfusion conformation even in the absence of F protein cleavage [54], [55]. intranasal vaccination of mice and cotton rats with BLP-F resulted in induction of F-specific IgG levels in sera and SIgA titers in nose lavages that were higher than those observed in animals vaccinated intramuscularly with FI-RSV. high serum levels of virus neutralizing antibodies were only observed after vaccination with BLP-F, both in cotton rats and mice. intranasal administered influenza vaccine mixed with BLPs resulted in superior protection against homologous and heterologous influenza virus infection compared to conventional intramuscular immunization. results suggest a role of local immunity in the protective capacity of intranasal BLP-based vaccines [24]. intranasal immunization with BLPs mixed with influenza subunit vaccine elicited Th1 skewed immune responses compared to those induced by intramuscular and intranasal administered influenza subunit vaccine alone. the role of TLR-2 in BLP dependent immune stimulation was recently confirmed by in vivo experiments using TLR2/ mice. the triple Strep-tagII (ST3; italic, green), GCN4 trimerization domain (red, bold) and the LysM domain (underlined, including LysM linker sequences) are shown in blue."}
