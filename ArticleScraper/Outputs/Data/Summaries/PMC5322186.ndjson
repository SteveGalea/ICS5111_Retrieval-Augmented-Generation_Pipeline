{"summary": "LPAI includes nearly all influenza subtypes, and wild bird migration can bring viruses to new areas and species. the virus most likely originated in wild bird populations [7,8], was introduced into domestic ducks and chickens. transmission to humans occurs primarily at live bird markets (LBMs), where direct contact between humans and infected poultry leads to spillover transmission. human cases serve as a sentinel proxy for infection rates among domestic poultry. this approach uses surveillance data during the early exponential growth period of an outbreak to provide retrospective estimates of R0 [15,16] a Bayesian approach [17] provides continuous estimation of all system parameters without specific assumptions. model-inference framework combines a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) compartmental model of influenza A(H7N9) virus transmission among poultry and the ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (EAKF) a total of 526 human influenza A(H7N9) cases were extracted from official reports of the national health and family planning Commission in China. the basic reproductive rate, R0, is calculated from the infection rate and mean infectious period as R0 = D. the effective reproductive rate is also determined from susceptibility as Re = R0 S / N. we used human influenza A(H7N9) case data as a proxy for infection among poultry. simulations of influenza A(H7N9) transmission and incidence among poultry and spillover transmission to humans were run using a 300-member ensemble of simulations. each simulation (i.e. ensemble member) was randomly assigned an initial combination of state variables and parameters from specified uniform distributions. each initialised ensemble member was then integrated through time using the model equations. initialisation and simulation with the SIR-EAKF framework. optimisation of three variables (S, Ic and Ih) and two parameters (D and R0) the 300-member ensemble simulations were repeated 10 times each season to account for stochastic effects due to the random selection of initial conditions. the average of the 10 repeated runs, each made up of a 300-member ensemble simulation, was used to derive mean posterior estimates of the model parameters. data From 19 February 2013 until 19 September 2015, a total of 526 human influenza A(H7N9) cases were extracted from official reports of the national health and family planning commission in China. the basic reproductive rate, R0, is calculated from the infection rate and mean infectious period as R0 = D. the effective reproductive rate is also determined from susceptibility as Re = R0 S / N. we used human influenza A(H7N9) case data as a proxy for infection among poultry. simulations of influenza A(H7N9) transmission and incidence among poultry and spillover transmission to humans were run using a 300-member ensemble of simulations. each simulation (i.e. ensemble member) was randomly assigned an initial combination of state variables and parameters from specified uniform distributions. each initialised ensemble member was then integrated through time using the model equations. initialisation and simulation with the SIR-EAKF framework. optimisation of three variables (S, Ic and Ih) and two parameters (D and R0) 300-member ensemble simulations were repeated 10 times each season to account for stochastic effects due to the random selection of initial conditions. the average of the 10 repeated runs, each made up of a 300-member ensemble simulation, was used to derive mean posterior estimates of the model parameters. in each season, variables and parameters were adjusted from the beginning of the season to the two-week period with the last recorded case. both the prior and posterior mean estimates are shown; EAKF adjustment at a given time is the difference of the mean posterior minus the mean prior. actual shifts in parameter value can occur as the pathogen moves through different subpopulations and/or geographical areas. model-inference system was again implemented using 300-member ensembles. simulations and forecasts were reinitialised with random selection of parameter and variable values at the beginning of each season. forecasts were generated beginning with the two-week period of the first recorded case. a ranking approach was used to identify the scaling with the lowest error. the scaling with the highest overall rank, i.e. = 300, was selected and used in all simulations and forecasts presented here. AKF system was coded in R. the mean posterior estimates of human influenza A(H7N9) incidence produced by the model-inference system matched the observed influenza A(H7N9) human case counts well. the posterior means and IQR of the number of chicken infections (Ic), chicken-to-chicken contact rate (), the infectious period (D) and the basic reproductive rate (R0) were estimated at maximum epidemic forcing (maximal Re) the susceptibility of the chicken population was high in earlier outbreaks and dropped to around 65% in more recent outbreaks. the scale factor, selected by the rank correlation approach, mapped the observed human cases to simulated poultry infections. the daily poultry-to-human spillover transmission rate was low, around 3.3 10-3 per infected LBM chicken. however, there was an apparent decrease in R0, Re, and susceptibility from the first to the third outbreak in the eastern region. forecasts predicting peak week within 1 week increased sharply from 6 weeks ahead of the observed peak week. accuracy was 43% and 63% at 2 weeks lead time and 61% and 98% at 0 weeks lead time for peak timing and magnitude, respectively. data assimilation methods and a simple epidemic model can produce accurate predictions of the peak timing and magnitude of human infections. the estimated potential of chicken-to-human spillover transmission was low, even with the high transmission rate among poultry. our estimates of R0 were similar to those of past pandemic influenza viruses in humans. in the eastern region, approaches such as closing of LBMs and halting live poultry trade were implemented during the early stages of the outbreaks. this probably reduced chicken-to-human exposure and chicken-to-chicken mixing and consequently may have attenuated the severity of the outbreak. the mean estimate of D was lower (3.95) than for the later outbreaks. our model only simulated chicken-to-chicken and chicken-to-human transmission (Formulas 1\u20133) and did not consider environmental transmission. prior attempts to simulate these different pathways suggest that the rates of chicken-to-environment shedding are low."}
