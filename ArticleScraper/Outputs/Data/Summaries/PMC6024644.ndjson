{"summary": "imaging studies under experimental in vitro conditions revealed exciting details of the replication cycle of many different viruses. viruses such as the model virus simian virus-40 allowed researchers to unravel basic concepts in cell biology such as caveolar endocytosis, endosomal trafficking, and cellular transformation. in vivo imaging studies with cellular and subcellular resolution intravital fluorescence microscopy has been applied. multi-photon intravital microscopy (MP-IVM) has been used to directly visualize viral pathogens in different tissues. for two-photon excitation, a GFP molecule must absorb two photons of half of the energy (i.e., double wavelength) within femtoseconds for excitation and subsequent light emission. the absorption of a single, lower energy photon with 960 nm is not sufficient to completely excite the GFP molecule. thus, the GFP molecule will return within femtoseconds to the ground state after absorption without photon emission. absorption of photons by heme-containing proteins such as oxygenated hemoglobin, pigment proteins such as melanin, water and lipids is minimal. penetration depths of MP-IVM can be diverse and even change within the same tissue. brain tissue allows fluorophore excitation of up to 1 mm depth. image quality of the liver and spleen deteriorates below 100 m because of the high density of heme-containing proteins particularly of red blood cells multi-photon excitation generates second harmonic signals to visualize tissue structures such as collagen of the lymph node capsule, blood vessels, stromal cell networks and follicular conduits. multi-photon excitation also supports the analysis of the cellular metabolic state by visualizing the cellular co-factors FAD and NADH. cell-to-cell transmission of the retroviruses human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and murine leukemia virus (MLV) [47,48,49,50,51] could be followed in vitro in real time. more complex experimental conditions consisting of mixture of primary cells derived from homogenized host tissue have been used to study virus infection under more physiological conditions. in vivo studies include intravital microscopy are crucial for our understanding of virus dissemination and pathogenesis. small animal models but also non-human primates have been extensively used to study viral pathogenesis. each tissue compartment is unique with respect to physiology, anatomical structure and host immune response. MP-IVM of HIV-infected humanized mice revealed syncytia formation of infected CD4+ T cells in the lymph node and spleen of infected mice. in vitro experiments using a mix of ECM proteins showed formation of HIV-induced syncytia depending on the stiffness of the surrounding 3D environment. a major challenge for in vivo imaging studies thereby is to maintain experimental conditions as close as possible to the physiological state imaging at the skin requires minimal specimen preparation. chemical or mechanical hair removal can cause local irritations that influence tissue physiology. complex surgeries are necessary to access other tissues such as lymph nodes, lung, and brain. anesthetic-mediated reduction of blood pressure was observed to impair kidney function and second messenger concentration. thermoregulation of the experimental animal is impaired during anesthesia. hydration of the experimental animal must be maintained through subcutaneous application of depots or continues intraperitoneal administration. the implantation of an internal window chamber allowed the analysis of lymphoma cell influx into inguinal lymph nodes for up to 14 days. an externally positioned chronic lymph node window was developed for longitudinal intravital imaging of the inguinal lymph node in mice without the need for serial surgeries. fluorescent proteins are expressed as fusion with viral or host cell proteins. the formation of oligomers can readily be observed when fluorescent proteins are expressed in cells. oligomerization of fluorescent proteins may interfere with the physiological function of the structural capsid protein Gag. pulsed labeling of cells with vital dyes in vitro has limitations for certain MP-IVM studies including long-term imaging. many different mouse lines are available that contain reporter genes for cytoplasmic fluorescent proteins such as EGFP and mCherry [97,98]. mouse strains with cell lineage-specific expression of the Cre recombinase are available for inducible expression of fluorescent proteins by target gene insertion in the ROSA26 locus using the Cre/LoxP system. the extent of manipulation is influenced by the accessibility of the tissue and range from simple fixation of the animal to complicated microsurgical procedures to expose the relevant organ. imaging at the popliteal lymph node and the brain requires fixation of the hind leg and skull. in contrast, intra-abdominal organs such as the gut and spleen are readily accessible because they can be exteriorized from the body cavity and directly immobilized to external fix points. anesthesia is supported by cardiorespiratory monitoring using transcutaneous pulse oximeters for non-invasive recordings of oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, and heart rate. hydration of the experimental animal must be maintained through subcutaneous application of depots or continues intraperitoneal administration. the quality of acquired data depends strongly on the preparation and monitoring of the experimental animal. multi-photon microscopy is a powerful technique to study viral infections in vivo. the spectral range between 650\u2013950 nm is described as the first optical window [89] fluorescent proteins are targeted to the membrane of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. the homo-oligomerization of proteins on opposing ER membranes restructures the tubular ER network into organized smooth ER whorl structures. this might resemble the conditions when fluorescent proteins are expressed as fusion with viral proteins such as the retroviral capsid protein Gag. cells can be isolated from knock-in mice that express cytoplasmic fluorescent proteins driven e.g., by the chicken -actin promoter with cytomegalovirus enhancer (CAG) long-term tracking of dividing cells without extensive bleaching is possible. some limitations exist that must be evaluated for each experiment. M have been used to drive expression of fluorescent proteins in dendritic cells (YFP), monocytes/DCs (EGFP) and monocytes/neutrophils (EGFP), respectively. neuronal cells in the central nervous system can be visualized in mice that express fluorescent proteins under the control of a modified Thy1 promoter region for specific neuronal expression. migratory T cells can form Syncytia in vivo and contribute to systemic dissemination of HIV. migratory T cells can exit peripheral lymph nodes via the efferent lymphatics. the HIV accessory factor Nef is a multifunctional protein that has been shown to modulate the activity, localization, and abundance of host cell proteins. in vitro experiments revealed that Nef can mediate downregulation of many surface proteins such as CD4 and MHC-I [115,116,117], counteract the host restriction factors SERINC-5 and -3 [118,119] and inhibit cellular motility and chemotaxis in vitro. MP-IVM reveals that HIV-1 Nef effectively interferes with diapedesis of T lymphocytes from HEVs into lymph nodes. a reduced homing efficiency but moderate effects on parenchymal motility. retroviruses such as HIV and MLV can disseminate from an infected cell. full-length MLV encoding for a capsid fusion with GFP (Gag-GFP) revealed a polarized distribution in static MLV-infected cells indicating the existence of VSs. in vivo synapses are dependent on the viral envelope glycoprotein. studies suggest multiple pathways of MLV transmission are evident in vivo strictly depending on the physiological context of the tissue. VS and trans-infection events could be observed in vivo for HIV and MLV in vivo. a subpopulation of HIV-infected cells in the spleen of humanized mice revealed an elongated morphology because of syncytia formation. the role of cellular syncytia for the replication and pathogenesis of HIV infection is still elusive and needs to be determined in vivo. PRV infection in mice shows symptoms of acute peripheral neuropathy. a subset (10\u201320%) of HIV-infected central memory-like T cells was shown to form syncytia with elongated cell morphology. HIV-infected human CD4 T cells revealed a reduced migration dynamic compared to uninfected cells. the migratory T cell population was shown to contribute to the systemic dissemination of HIV. recirculation of T lymphocytes into lymph nodes requires a functional actin network for extravasation through high endothelial venules. expression of HIV Nef in primary mouse CD4+ T cells caused a significant reduction in the homing efficiency of T lymphocytes into lymph nodes. retroviruses such as HIV and MLV can disseminate from an infected cell by diffusion through the extracellular space or efficiently spread by direct contact between virus-presenting donor cells and target cells. non-permissive cells can capture virus particles and transfer them to a target cell for infection. IVM revealed how lymph- and blood-derived MLV can establish infection at secondary lymphoid tissues such as lymph nodes and the spleen. Resident macrophages at the subcapsular sinus floor of the popliteal lymph nodes bind and concentrate lymph-derived MLV particles for trans-infection of target B1 cells. in vitro studies revealed that cell-cell transmission of HIV results in co-transmission of multiple copies of the HIV genome across VS [129,130,131] cell-cell transmission leads to a reduced sensitivity of HIV to antiretroviral drugs [132,133] and resistance to certain broadly neutralizing antibodies. a subpopulation of HIV-infected cells in the spleen of humanized mice revealed an elongated morphology because of syncytia formation. the role of cellular syncytia for the replication and pathogenesis of HIV infection is still elusive and needs to be determined in vivo. MP-IVM allows minimal invasive studies of viral infections in real-time at cellular and subcellular resolution. multi-photon excitation enables 3D imaging of cellular dynamics and even the diffraction-limited visualization of fluorescent viral particles in vivo. two-photon microscopy has the unique capability to initiate highly localized photochemical reactions. photochemical processes such as photo-uncaging and photo-conversion can be specifically triggered under in vivo conditions with spatial and temporal precision. LOV domains can be used to cage bioactive peptides by steric inhibition of protein binding sites for the control of endogenous protein activity. a new approach was developed to define cellular and molecular composition of niches within the tissue of interest. single-cell RNA-seq analysis of rare cell subpopulations and unique gene programs of cells can be analyzed and set into the defined tissue context. this novel approach represents a powerful method to study local events during virus infection since immune function but also virus pathogenesis depends on the dynamic interaction of heterogeneous cell types within the tissue microenvironment. non-channel optogenetics is based on natural photoreceptors with chromophores for photon absorption leading to conformational changes of the receptor. non-channel, light-controlled modules have been used to manipulate signaling cascades, stimulate DNA binding, alter cell polarity, and trigger cell motility with high temporal and spatial precision. cell composition and tissue-specific factors create a highly structured and spatially organized environment that is critical for the physiological function of the tissue and cells within. a new approach was developed to define cellular and molecular composition of niches within the tissue of interest [162] reporter viruses for cytoplasmic GFP expression have been used to study the dynamic behavior of retrovirus-infected cells in vivo. the effects of PRV infection on neuronal signaling could be visualized after expression of calcium indicators in infected neurons. apoptosis-mediated contraction of CD4+ T cells could be visualized in vivo. similar approaches could be helpful to study HIV-induced bystander cell death. visualizing collagen by label-free SHG could be a valuable tool to study lymphoid tissue fibrosis in response to HIV infection. activation of cell signaling networks at immune cell contacts was recently shown to be essential for signaling-dependent enhancement of HIV dissemination in vivo. MP-IVM of cell signal proteins during viral infection in vivo is another exciting research field."}
