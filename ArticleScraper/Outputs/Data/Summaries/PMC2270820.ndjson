{"summary": "virus isolates are sometimes obtained which cannot be typed by current methods. the novel strain was likely the result of recombination between structural protein genes of an ancestor of contemporary HPeV1 strains and nonstructural protein genes from an unknown ancestor. LP (VIDISCA) uses cell culture supernatants treated by DNase digestion in modified cDNA analysis. AFLP uses restriction enzyme digestion sites in an unknown DNA sequence to ligate oligonucleotide adaptors. this method has been described in the context of the discovery of a novel human Coronavirus in 2004. the genome of the prototype strain was characterised in the 1960s. it was isolated in the 1960s. for more recent strains, only limited sequencing has been done. a 188 nucleotide DNA fragment was homologous in a nucleotide BLAST search with the capsid (P1) protein region of HPeV strains. no specific RT-PCR was done because these viruses are known to occur almost exclusively in children, and this patient was an adult. the evolutionary histories were inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method. the scale shows evolutionary distance from each root. the tree was rooted against a murine parechovirus. the predicted secondary structure of the 3'-nonconding region is also shown in Figure 3. the predicted secondary structure of the 3' UTR of BNI-788st is also shown in Figure 3. a conserved repeat structure as recently described for prototype HPeV [14] was also present.

VIDISCA [8] is a virus identification method which has not yet been widely applied. we found a contemporary HPeV type 1 strain and analysed its full genome. the targeted technical search for novel viral agents has become a focus in virology. the entire procedure including virus particle enrichment, nuclease digestion, nucleic acids preparation, double stranded cDNA synthesis, restriction digestion, adapter ligation and two stages of PCR amplification took two full working days to be completed. the finding of evidence for a potentially recombinant ancestry of our contemporary strain was rather interesting. phylogenetic analysis of the whole non-structural gene portion placed BNI-788st and both HPeV3 strains behind a common ancestor with 88% bootstrap support. recombination in the 5'-proximal part of the non-structural protein genes would have been a basal, non-recent event. the 5'-noncoding region of BNI-788st could have been acquired from an HPeV4. the secondary structure prediction of the 5'-noncoding region will help following this up. however, it cannot be analysed from available data whether this has occurred before or along with acquisition of VP0. centrifugation at 38.000 g for 4 h. pellets were treated with 2 U of DNase 1 (Ambion) in 1X buffer, 100 l reaction volume, at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. cDNA synthesis primed by random hexamer oligonucleotides was performed. PCR product under a touchdown cycling protocol: 95\u00b0C, 4 min, followed by 10 cycles of 94\u00b0C/30s, 65\u00b0C, 30s, 72\u00b0C 1 min, followed by 25 cycles of 94\u00b0C/30s, 56\u00b0C, 30s, 72\u00b0C, 1 min. products were analysed by agarose gel electrophoresis. patients and samples A cell culture supernatant from GMK-AH1 cells showed a cytopathogenic effect (CPE) was obtained during routine testing for agents of viral enteritis. cDNA-Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism analysis (VIDISCA) was performed as described by van der Hoek et al. the first amplification stage (20 cycles, 50 l reaction volumes) used 300 nM of primers CTCGTAGACTGCGTACGATG and GACGATGATCGC at 56\u00b0C annealing temperature with Platinum Taq polymerase. the resulting 16 different combinations of forward and reverse primers were each used on 2 l of the first stage PCR product. pCR4 vectors (Invitrogen) were designed specifically for determined sequences. sequences were confirmed from virus RNA by direct sequencing. RNA secondary structure was predicted by Mfold, version 3.2. Vo\u00df, and B. Liedigk for excellent technical assistance."}
