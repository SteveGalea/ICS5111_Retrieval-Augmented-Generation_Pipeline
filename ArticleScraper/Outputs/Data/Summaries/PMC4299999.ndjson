{"summary": "infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and Newcastle disease virus (NDV) are the most important viruses of poultry worldwide. similar respiratory signs of infectious bronchitis (IB) and Newcastle disease (ND) make differential diagnosis difficult. the duplex RT-PCR has the ability to amplify and differentiate multiple specific nucleic acids. the aim of the present study was to detect and differentiate two common avian viral pathogens using duplex RT-PCR. the thermal profile for duplex-RT-PCR included an initial denaturation in 94 C for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94 C for 45 sec, 55 C for 45 sec, and 72 C for 45 sec. the duplex-RT-PCR products visualized by gel electrophoresis was 433 bp for IBV and 121 bp for NDV. the specificity of developed duplex-RT-PCR assay for detection and differentiation of IBV and NDV was validated examining 12 clinical samples as shown in Fig. 2. RT-PCR developed in the present study using clinical samples. developed duplex RT-PCR was able to detect and differentiate two important viral respiratory diseases of poultry and more importantly the technique was able to simultaneously detect infected birds with both viruses. the rapid detection of viral infectious agents in intensive poultry production system is very important."}
