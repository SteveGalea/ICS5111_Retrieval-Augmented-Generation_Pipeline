{"summary": "HCoV NL63 is a large-envelope virus with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome of approximately 28 kb in length. it contains a cap structure at its 5 end and a poly(A) tail at its 3 end. the genome consists of 5 and 3 noncoding regions (NCRs), the 1a and 1b genes that encode the nonstructural polyproteins divided by host and viral proteases. primers consisting of oligo(dT) and 3-untranslated region (UTR) reverse primer and performed with PCR using 20 pairs of primers amplifying 10 overlapped fragments. the primers were designed using CLC Main Workbench version 7.0.3 (Qiagen) based on the sequence of the HCoV NL63 isolate CBJ 037 genome."}
