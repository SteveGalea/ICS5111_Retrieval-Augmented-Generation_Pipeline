{"summary": "116 travellers arriving from Mexico by direct or connecting flights would have been necessary for every one traveller at risk of transporting A(H1N1)pdm09 out of Mexico. screening at just eight airports would have resulted in the assessment of 90% of all air travellers at risk of transporting A(H1N1)pdm09 out of Mexico in the early stages of the pandemic. world health assembly ratified changes to the 1969 international health regulations. aims were to prevent, protect against, control and provide a public health response to the international spread of disease. these aims can be achieved by addressing local conditions that contribute to the emergence of epidemics. international experts evaluated the performance of the 2005 international health regulations during the influenza A (H1N1) 2009 pandemic. they highlighted the need for stronger evidence to justify any public health measures that could substantially disrupt international travel and trade. the panel recommended that the world health organization review and assess the effectiveness and impact of the border measures that were implemented during the A(H1N1) 2009 pandemic. all assumptions that were made in the analysis are shown in box 1. Fig. 1. Conceptual framework for airport-based screening of travellers for infectious disease. screening of travellers at other airports before they boarded flights out of Mexico would have been considered \u201cat-risk\u201d. an estimated 95% of the world\u2019s commercial air traffic over this period. we then quantified the weekly numbers of A(H1N1) pandemic-related news stories recorded in 2009 by the global public health intelligence network. trends in the weekly numbers were then compared with the deviations (from the \u201cusual\u201d traffic observed in the pre-pandemic years of 2007 and 2008) seen in international air traffic over Mexico in 2009. median travel times and interquartile ranges were calculated using 2009 flight schedules. median times between at-risk travellers starting their international trips were determined. indiscriminate entry screening and exit screening were calculated. analysis of flight itineraries of 583 774 at-risk travellers flew out of Mexico in may 2009 revealed exit screening would have caused the least disruption to international air traffic. only 6017 (1%) of the international air travellers who left Mexico in may 2009 were categorized as being at low risk of infection with A(H1N1)pdm09. at-risk travellers who flew out of Mexico in April 2009 would have had to be assessed to ensure that every at-risk traveller from Mexico was screened. the results for the at-risk travellers who flew out of Mexico in April 2009 were generally similar. dm09 in humans is about 2 days (range: 1\u20137),25. 78% and 91% of at-risk travellers who flew from Mexico in may 2009 should have ended their air travel within 6 and 12 hours. even the longest direct flights from Mexico should have taken less than one day. in the A(H1N1) 2009 pandemic, assessment of health status of travellers at 99.3% of the world\u2019s international airports could have been foregone at the expense of very few missed opportunities to prevent or delay the spread of A(H1N1)pdm09. in 2009, most international flights took less than 12 hours, with most such flights occurring within the same global region or between neighbouring regions. traveller numbers tend to be inversely correlated with travel distance and flight duration. but the full, global public health benefits of targeted entry screening are only likely to be observed if all destination airports implement such screening in unison. targeted entry screening could mitigate the impact of imported disease. based on the results of the present, retrospective evaluation, we developed a decision-support tool for national authorities confronted with the formidable challenge of making rational, timely and defensible decisions. the present study has several limitations. we did not address the issues of whether international air travellers should be screened at all or when the screening programmes should be initiated and discontinued. the findings are drawn from the experience of a pandemic emerging in Mexico. the prevalence of detectable disease would decline unless international transit travellers could easily be separated from other international travellers within the hub. for the present evaluation, we used static definitions of \u201cat-risk\u201d and \u201clow-risk\u201d travellers based on the presumption that the international spread of A(H1N1)pdm09 out of non-Mexican cities was negligible. interventions to mitigate the international spread of infectious disease would have the greatest global impact if implemented as close as possible to the sources of future epidemic threats."}
