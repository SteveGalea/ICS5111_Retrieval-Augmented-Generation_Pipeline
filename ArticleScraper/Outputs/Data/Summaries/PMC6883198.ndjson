{"summary": "more than 50% of mortality in preweaned calves has been related to diarrhea. the biggest cause for diarrhea in calves is the rapid reduction in antibodies in the colostrum after birth. Viruses, bacteria, and protozoans are known to cause infectious diarrhea. the clinical symptoms of diarrhea are very similar in spite of the differences in the causative agents. however, in Korea, only a few small-scale studies have been performed on the causative agents of diarrhea in KNC. fecal samples were classified as pasty, watery, mucous, and hemorrhagic. DNA and RNA were extracted from fecal samples using Patho Gene-spin DNA/RNA Extraction kit. fecal samples were inoculated in 9 mL of Rappaport-Vassiliadis (RV) R10 broth (BD, USA) and incubated at 42\u00b0C for 24 h. a loopful of RV culture was streaked onto CHROMagar Salmonella Plus (CHROMagar, France) the 18S rRNA of Cryptosporidium spp. was amplified using primer set 18SiF/18SiR. nested PCR was performed with two primer sets G7/G759 and G7n/G759n. a total of 207 diarrheal KNC below 210 days of age from 96 farms were studied from July 2014 to June 2016. the mean and median ages of 207 calves were 33.73 42 and 20 42 days respectively. the breeding environment of Korean native cattle is different from the isolation during artificial feeding of cow calves. rotavirus using an i-BD Multi Detection Kit (iNtRON Biotechnology, Inc.) RT-PCR for adenovirus, norovirus, kobuvirus, parvovirus, and torovirus was performed as previously described. fecal samples were inoculated on macConkey and blood agar. samples were mixed with 100% alcohol, allowed to stand for 1 h at room temperature, subjected to alcohol shock, and centrifuged at 3,800 g for 10 min. the pellet was inoculated in approximately 1 mL of TCCFB (cycloserine-cefoxitin fructose broth containing 0.1% taurocholate sodium) and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 7 days. causative agents were detected in 164 of 207 diarrheal calves (79.2%) the remaining diarrheal calves were placed in abomasal impaction (n = 6), abomasal ulcer (n = 3), abomasal impaction (n = 6), abomasal ulcer (n = 3), and others. rotavirus, Eimeria spp., Giardia spp., E. coli, Cryptosporidium spp., BVDV, and coronavirus were the main causative agents in KNC. a total of 95 from 164 calves (57.9%) were infected with a single causative agent, while 69 calves (42.1%) were infected with multiple causative agents. in cases of mixed infection, 53 calves (32.3%) were infected with double causative agents and 9 (5.5%), 6 (3.7%), and 1 (0.6%) were infected with triple agents, quadruple agents, and quintuple agents. most causative agents were related to mixed infection rather than single infection. norovirus 1 Parvovirus, torovirus 1 Parvovirus, Eimeria spp. 1 Kobuvirus, Eimeria spp. 1 Kobuvirus, Eimeria spp. 1 Kobuvirus, Giardia spp. 1 Torovirus, Eimeria spp. 1 BVDV, adenovirus, Eimeria spp. 1 BVDV, adenovirus, Eimeria spp. 1 BVDV causative agents No. of calves with single agent No. of calves with mixed agents Virus Rotavirus 57 28 29 BVDV 14 3 11 Coronavirus 13 5 8 Torovirus 11 3 8 Parvovirus 9 5 4 Norovirus 8 3 5 Kobuvirus 3 1 2 Adenovirus 2 0 2 Subtotal (%) 117 (45.5) 48 (18.7) 69 (26.8) Bacteria E. coli 36 13 23 C. difficile 16 4 12 Salmonella spp 22 4 3 0 1 0 4 4 10 1 4 0 1 0 38.6% 30.8% 21.4% 0.0% 11.1% 0.0% 50.0% 36.4% 27.8% 100.0% 25.0% 0.0% 8.3% 0.0% 1\u20132 weeks (n = 26) 17 3 1 0 1 1 2 2 7 0 3 0 1 2 2 29.8% 23.1% 7.1% 0.0% 11.1% 33.3% 25.0% 18.2% 19.4% 0.0% 18.8% 0.0% 8.3% 8.7% 1 0 2 0 0 6 0 0 0.0% 15.4% 7.1% 0.0% 22.2% 0.0% 0.0% 18.2% 5.6% 0.0% 0.0% 11.5% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% Total (n = 164) 57 13 14 2 9 3 8 11 36 1 16 52 12 23 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% Diarrhea caused by Giardia spp. occurred in KNC between 2 and 10 weeks of age. the occurrence of diarrhea by Giardia spp. differed significantly with onset age (p = 0.002) Viral and bacterial causative agents were mainly detected in KNC within 3 weeks of age. the 2 test was used to analyse the differences in the prevalence of diarrhea caused by each causative agent across seasons. seasonal mortality rate caused by diarrhea in diarrheal calves was 46.3% (76 out of 164 calves) in spring. calves were 7.9% (13 out of 164 calves) in spring, 6.7% (11 calves) in winter, 3% (5 calves) in summer, and 0.6% (1 calves) in fall. mortality rate caused by diarrhea was the highest in winter. rovirus, coli, C. difficile, and Eimeria spp. caused the most severe hemorrhagic diarrhea. rovirus, coli, coli, c. difficile, and spp. caused the most severe hemorrhagic diarrhea. causative agents were detected in 164 of 207 diarrheal calves. rotavirus, Eimeria spp., Giardia spp., BVDV, and coronavirus were the main causative agents in KNC. a total of 95 from 164 calves (57.9%) were infected with a single causative agent.

Diarrhea caused by Giardia spp. occurred in KNC between 2 and 10 weeks of age. seasonal prevalence of diarrhea in diarrheal calves was 46.3% (76 out of 164 calves) in spring, 32.3% (53 out of 164 calves) in winter, 13.4% (22 out of 164 calves) in summer, and 7.9% (13 out of 164 calves) in fall. seasonal mortality rate caused by diarrhea in diarrheal calves was 7.9% (13 out of 164 calves) in spring, 6.7% (11 calves) in winter, 3% (5 calves) in summer, and 0.6% (1 calves) in fall. mortality rate caused by diarrhea was the highest in winter. calves with rotavirus, coronavirus, parvovirus, torovirus, torovirus, E. coli, C. difficile, and Eimeria spp showed fecal forms very similar to those of calves with only rotavirus infection. in most cases, rotavirus and E. coli induced severe watery diarrhea. oeal calves involved in this study found six with abomasal impaction and three with abomasal ulcers. it was difficult to identify the cause of diarrhea for the other calves because of the following reasons: 1) Insufficient fecal volume of the sample; 2) The fecal volume was sufficient, but the causative agent may be other than the 14 causal agents selected in the experimental design. isolated from 7.6% of diarrheal calves from south area of Gyeongnam. only one case of Salmonella spp. was identified as a very rare causative agent in single suckle beef calves. in the present study, protozoan and viral causative agents were found to be the predominant causative agents. a previous study in south Korea, Giardia spp. was detected in 13.1% of diarrheal calves using PCR [33], consistent with the results of the present study. the peak time for the identification of rotavirus in diarrheal calves is from 0 to 2 weeks of age. rotavirus was the most common pathogen identified in each age group of Australian dairy calves. in the present study, the prevalence of diarrhea was 46.3% in spring, 13.4% in summer, 7.9% in fall, and 32.3% in winter. calf diarrhea increased in proportion to the number of calf births in spring. in winter, the ratio of diarrheal calves to calf births was doubled. spp. and Giardia spp. mainly occurred in summer (warm and humid season) it was difficult to distinguish between different causes of diarrhea in calves by gross observation. however, a specific difference in diarrheal feces was observed based on the causative agents."}
