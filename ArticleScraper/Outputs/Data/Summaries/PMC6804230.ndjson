{"summary": "the most advanced stage of HIV infection is the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), which can take from two to 15 years to develop. the most advanced stage of HIV infection is the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), which can take from two to 15 years to develop. HIV-2 is estimated to be more than 55% genetically distinct from HIV-1. the transmission rate is much lower in HIV-2 than in HIV-1. the attachment of HIV in any of the above mentioned ways can increase the efficacy of infection because it brings Env into close proximity with the viral receptor CD4 and co-receptor. a progressive decline of CD4 + cells consequently leads to the failure of the immune system function and the development of opportunistic infections that usually lead to death. fusion inhibitors are the first FDA approved fusion inhibitor for the treatment of HIV-1/AIDS acting through the binding to the gp41 subunit of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein. some restrictions, such as a low genetic barrier for drug resistance and a short in vivo half-life, limit its clinical use. the established latent pro-viral reservoirs in the patient\u2019s body can stochastically begin to reproduce viral particles. none of these compounds have led to a promising cure. a number of rare and long-term remissions of HIV cases are described in the literature. marine organisms make up to two-thirds of Earth\u2019s species and produce unique and structurally diverse metabolites. the highest share of marine metabolites (up to 70%) are obtained from marine sponges, corals, and microorganisms. mollusks, ascidians, and algae metabolites form only a minor part. glycan structures on the surface of gp120 alter the gp120 structure or its oligomeric state. this interaction relies on the trimeric \u201csugar tower,\u201d including N295 and N448 [27] Griffitshin can also prevent infections caused by other glycoprotein-enveloped viruses such as the Ebola virus, hepatitis C virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. chitosan and its derivatives, sulfated polysaccharides, lectins, bromotyrosine derivatives, peptides, alkaloids, diterpenes, phlorotannins, and xanthones, as well as fish oil as an auxiliary to HAART therapy. chitosan is loaded with saquinavir, an anti-HIV drug with a protease inhibitor oligomers are conjugates of chitosan and the Gln-Met-Trp peptide. they suppress syncytium formation, which occurs as a fusion of infected cells with neighboring cells, induced by HIV in a dose-dependent manner. however, after a certain period, the number of syncytia once again increased. both oligomers showed high potency when applied immediately upon the HIV-1 infection of cells. the effect of these oligomers was highest when applied immediately upon the HIV-1 infection of cells. sulfated polysaccharides are the most studied class of antiviral polysaccharides. negatively charged sulfated polysaccharides on the HIV-1 entry into cells may be due to 1) their binding onto the positively charged V3 domain of gp120, thereby preventing the virus attachment to the cell surface [43,44,45] or 2) the masking of the docking sites of gp120 for sCD4 on the surface of T lymphocytes, thereby disrupting the CD4-gp120 interaction [46,47,48] and subsequently inhibiting the expression of sulfated fucan polysaccharides, ascophyllan (4, Figure 4), and two fucoidans (S and A) significantly inhibit the early step of HIV-1 (R9 and JR-Fl) infection. they also inhibit the VSV-G-pseudotype HIV-1 infection in HeLa cells. depolymerized fucosylated CS has shown in vitro activity against a range of viral strains, including the resistant ones. the depolymerized fragments seem to maintain a similar anti-HIV action at the early stages of infection. other polyanionic HIV entry inhibitors failed to prove effective against the heterosexual HIV-1 transmission. a relatively new strategy in inducing immunity and developing an HIV vaccine is to use carbohydrates. the major difficulty of such an approach lies in mimicking the specific glycan protective epitope. most of the vaccines for HIV-1 in preclinical trials are based on a Man1-2Man oligomannosyl epitope. lectins have become promising agents for antiretroviral therapy. their antiretroviral activity is manifest through an alteration of the interaction between HIV gp120 or gp41 and the corresponding receptors [81], which inhibit the HIV cell function, HIV infectivity, and the formation of the syncytium, multi-nucleated cells. two KAA recombinants inhibited the HIV-1 entry at IC50s. authors concluded that the majority of marine peptides have strong anti-HIV activity. they are usually isolated from marine organisms through the process of enzymatic hydrolysis. stellettapeptin A and stellettapeptin B have an unexpected polyketide subunit, 3-hydroxy-6,8-dimethylnon-4-enoic acid, 3-OHGln, and 3-OHAsn residues. their high potency is witnessed through low EC50 values (inhibition of the cytotoxic effect upon HIV infection) newly discovered anti-HIV constituents derived from marine sponges Verongula rigida and Aiolochoria cras aeroplysinin-1 (10), 19-deoxyfistularin 3 (15), purealidin B (16), fistularin 3 (17) and 3-bromo-5-hydroxy-O-methyltyrosine (18) influenced the nuclear import of the HIV virus with around or more than 50% of inhibition.

0.3; 0.6 g/mL) the early step of HIV-1 (R9 and JR-Fl) infection. CS, extracted from the sea cucumber, has shown in vitro activity against a range of viral strains, including the resistant ones. FuCS is effective in blocking the laboratory strain HIV-1IIIB entry and replication by inhibiting the p24 antigen production. also effective in T-20-resistant strains. a relatively new strategy in inducing immunity is to use carbohydrates. the major difficulty of such an approach lies in mimicking the specific glycan protective epitope. most of the vaccines for HIV-1 in preclinical trials are based on a man1-2Man oligomannosyl epitope. the acidic sulfate groups on heparin (3, Figure 3) can inhibit HIV through electrostatic interactions with basic amino-acid residues of the transcriptional activator Tat protein. the main anti-infectious activities documented for the fucose-containing SP are those against viruses [54], 55,56]. depolymerized fucosylated CS has shown in vitro activity against a range of viral strains, including the resistant ones. they also inhibit the VSV-G-pseudotype HIV-1 infection in HeLa cells. sulfated fucose branches appear necessary for antiviral activity, which is also affected by molecular weight and carboxylation. other polyanionic HIV entry inhibitors failed to prove effective against the heterosexual HIV-1 transmission. inadequate mimicry of the glycan shield, tolerance mechanisms, and/or the inability to induce a domain-exchange are reflecting difficulties in creating proper specificity of Abs. most of the vaccines for HIV-1 in preclinical trials are based on a Man1-2Man oligomannosyl epitope [72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79] only Hirayama et al. (2016) reported about the new high-mannose specific lectin and its recombinants that possess anti-HIV activity. authors confirmed KAA-1 and KAA-2, two KAA mannose-binding lectin isomers, as potent anti-HIV agents. most marine peptides have strong anti-HIV activity. stellettapeptin A and stellettapeptin B have an unexpected polyketide subunit, 3-hydroxy-6,8-dimethylnon-4-enoic acid, 3-OHGln, and 3-OHAsn residues. these compounds have previously undescribed nonproteinogenic amino-acid parts on peptides that are rarely found in nature. aeroplysinin 1 (15), 19-deoxyfistularin 3 (15), purealidin B (16), fistularin 3 (17) and 3-bromo-5-hydroxy-O-methyltyrosine (18) were the most potent in their anti-HIV activity. lysinin-1 (10), 19-deoxyfistularin 3 (15), purealidin B (16), fistularin 3 (17) and 3-bromo-5-hydroxy-O-methylty -O-methyltyrosine 73% of inhibition at 80 M. all compounds were active in a dose-depended manner, with the highest results of inhibition obtained for 3,5-dibromo-N,N,N,O-tetramethyltyraminium (13), from 14% to 30%. authors stressed structural similarity of these compounds with the HIV integrase and protease inhibitors.
