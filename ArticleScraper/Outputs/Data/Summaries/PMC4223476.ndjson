HEK 293-T cells were transfected with pCI, pCI-GBF1WT, or pCI-GBF1M832L. at 24 h post-transfection, cells were reseeded into 6-well plates. the following day, cells in representative wells were counted to ensure that infections were set up at the same moi. immunoprecipitations were performed with the following antibodies: rabbit IgG (control), rabbit polyclonal anti-BIG1 and rabbit polyclonal anti-GBF1. inputs and eluates shown in the same horizontal row are from the same film exposure. a representative result from three independent experiments is shown. intracellular RNA was harvested when the 12 h sample was harvested. the cells were washed to remove extracellular virus, and medium with either DMSO or GCA was added as for the 12 h sample. the normalized level of NS2A was set to 1 for each experiment. the presence of intracellular DENV RNA at 30 min postinternalization showed that similar amounts of DENV internalized into both GCA- and DMSO-treated cells. for each experiment, an additional well was infected and treated in parallel and allowed to incubate for 16 h. thus, GCA inhibits a postentry step of DENV infection. GCA-pulses failed to have any effect on intracellular levels of DENV RNA. the requirement for GBF1 is satisfied within the first 24 h of infection. we turned to shRNA-mediated gene silencing. representative wells of each cell line were detached by trypsinization. cell viabilities were also determined by trypan blue exclusion. cells were then infected with DENV (moi = 1) and incubated for 16 h. after synthesis of cDNA, the amounts of DENV NS2A and GBF1 were quantified by qPCR and normalized to the internal control RPL13A. cells were infected with deNV (moi = 1\u20132) after which time viral inoculum was removed. after synthesis of cDNA, deNV NS2A RNA and GBF1 mRNA were quantified by qPCR and normalized to internal control RPL13A. cells from the experiment described in Fig. 6B were seeded onto cover slips and treated with DMSO or GCA (1 m) after 16 h, cells were fixed with formaldehyde, permeabilized, and immunolabeled with anti-GM130 primary antibodies followed by Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies. reducing the level of GBF1 sensitizes DENV infection of cells to GCA, indicating that KD of GBF1 and GCA inhibit DENV infection in a concerted manner. this observation reinforces the idea that GBF1 is a specific host factor used by DENV, and supports a proviral role for GBF1. the I-DIRT technique discriminates high affinity prelysis interactions from nonspecific postlysis interactions. cells transfected with each GFP-tagged viral construct produced approximately equal levels of ectopically expressed fusion protein and virally expressed untagged protein. NS5-GFP exhibited a similar subcellular localization to native NS5 in DENV-infected cells. aliquots of mixed lysate IP inputs were saved for each experiment. aliquots of mixed lysate IP inputs were saved for each experiment. a large number of proteins were associated with NS3-GFP. metabolically heavy cells were generated by passaging in medium containing exclusively heavy lysine and arginine (Lys8 and Arg10) until incorporation was verified to be >95%. lysine and arginine were substituted for their isotopically heavy counterparts. mixed lysate inputs and proteins associated with GFP-tagged protein complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie dye.

NS5-GFP and NS3-GFP interaction networks included some expected host proteins, such as exportin-1 (CRM1) and fatty acid synthase (FASN), an enzyme involved in fatty acid biosynthesis that has been shown to the 53 high confidence NS5-GFP interactors (A) and the 41 high confidence NS3-GFP interactors (B) were entered into GeneMANIA to generate interaction networks. significantly enriched GO annotations of interest, and their corresponding proteins, are labeled. the NS3-GFP interaction network was most enriched in protein folding and the unfolded protein response. the NS3-GFP interaction network was also significantly enriched for the viral infectious cycle, the viral reproductive process, and major histocompatibility complex class I protein binding. treatment with either compound reduced the level of intracellular DENV RNA 10-fold. the drug concentrations were not significantly toxic to cells at the incubation times. we overexpressed either wild-type GBF1 (GBF1WT) or a GCA-insensitive version harboring an M832L mutation (GBF1M832L) the amount of DENV RNA in DMSO-treated cells was set to 1. Data are expressed as means S.D. of relative quantification values of NS2A (n = 3 for HepG2; n = 4 for HEK293) HepG2 cells were prechilled at 4 \u00b0C and then infected with DENV (moi = 2) for 1 h. cell lysates were prepared at 24 h postinfection. a representative result from three independent experiments is shown. the cells in the 12 h sample were incubated 12 h in the presence of DMSO or GCA. the cells in the 24 h sample were washed to remove extracellular virus. NS2A in DMSO-treated cells at 12 h was set to 1 for each experiment. deNV virions rely wholly on clathrin-mediated endocytosis for uptake into cells (44) however, we confirmed that GCA did not interfere with virus entry in our system. for each experiment, an additional well was infected and treated in parallel. the levels of intracellular DENV RNA still increased almost 100-fold between 12 h and 24 h postinfection. after 24 h of infection, GCA-pulses failed to have any effect on the intracellular levels of DENV RNA. the requirement for GBF1 is satisfied within the first 24 h of infection. cell lines were obtained with puromycin selection (1.5 g/ml) and were generated fresh for each experiment. cells in at least two representative wells of each cell line were detached by trypsinization and counted at least in duplicate to ensure that infections were set up at the same moi. cell viabilities were also determined by trypan blue exclusion. hepG2 cells with stable integration of tetracycline-inducible shRNA directed against GBF1 were generated as above. cells were then incubated either in the absence or presence of doxycycline (2 g/ml) for 48 h. before DENV infection, cells in at least two representative wells were detached by trypsinization. doxycycline-mediated induction of shRNA expression effectively reduced the level of GBF1 mRNA to 30% that of non-induced cells. cells from the experiment described in Fig. 6B were seeded onto cover slips and treated with DMSO or GCA (1 m) cells were seeded onto cover slips and treated with DMSO or GCA. the IC50 value was 50-fold higher in control cells compared with GBF1-KD cells. reducing the level of GBF1 sensitizes DENV infection of cells to GCA. this indicates that KD of GBF1 and GCA inhibit DENV infection in a concerted manner. 10 m GCA is sufficient to fully disrupt Golgi morphology (Fig. 6C), but not sufficient to inhibit DENV infection. we strove to reduce background, exclude contaminant proteins, and identify bona fide interactions by: 1) isolating complexes from infected cells; 2) appending affinity tags to the viral baits (NS5 and NS3); 3) incorporating an isotopic labeling-based approach, the I-DIRT technique (42), to metabolically light cells were transfected with constructs driving expression of NS5-GFP, NS3-GFP, or GFP and then infected with DENV. aliquots of mixed lysate IP inputs were saved for each experiment. the DIRT approach allows IPs to be performed in relatively nonstringent conditions. it allows the discrimination of specific from nonspecific interactors (42). mixed lysate inputs and proteins associated with GFP-tagged protein complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie dye. in-gel trypsin digestion was performed prior to LC-MS/MS analysis to identify and quantify the heavy to light ratios of proteins associated with the tagged viral baits. all peptides matching to all members of a family were reported in supplemental Table S1C. each independent replicate thus yielded its own unique cutoff value, specific to its mixed lysate input. for each set of IPs (NS5-GFP, NS3-GFP, or GFP), the ratio counts used for quantitation of each protein, average light to heavy ratios of each protein, and light to heavy ratio SDs for each protein are given in supplemental Table S1. of these host proteins, 13 were shared by both NS5 and NS3. Associated host proteins (41 in total) whose light to heavy ratio was higher than the appropriate cutoff in each of three biological replicates. the NS3-GFP bait is also shown in yellow circles with purple borders. target proteins were immunoprecipitated out of lysates from DENV-infected HepG2 cells. the eluates were immunoblotted for the target proteins and either NS5 or NS3. of the interactions tested, only HEATR2 yielded inconclusive results. cells, and immunoprecipitations with antibodies cross-linked to Protein G-Dynabeads were performed as in Fig. 1. bound proteins were eluted in loading sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were then immunoblotted with the designated antibodies. results shown are representative of at least three independent experiments for each antibody. panel of 8 KD cell lines generated by lentiviral transduction. cells were incubated in doxycycline (2 g/ml) for 96 h to induce shRNA expression. cells were then infected with DENV (moi = 1). doxycycline-mediated induction of shRNA expression. cells were infected with DENV and intracellular RNA was harvested at 24 h postinfection. host genes whose silencing affected DENV infection to the greatest extent were DHCR7, SERPINH1 and ZW10. 0.05, NS5 and NS3) all significantly enriched (Fig. 4 and supplemental Table S4) both interactions were also enriched in transmembrane transporter activity for carboxylic acids and organic acids. derived membranes (59), NS5 also undergoes both nuclear import (55) and export (56) the NS3-GFP interaction network was most enriched in protein folding and the unfolded protein response (q 0.001 for both. we infected cells with DENV and then incubated cells for 16 h. the levels of intracellular DENV RNA were then quantified by qPCR. treatment with either compound reduced the level of intracellular DENV RNA 10-fold. hepG2 or HEK293 cells were infected with DENV for 1 h. after 16 h, the levels of DENV NS2A were quantified by qPCR. results are expressed as means S.D. of relative quantification values of NS2A. experiments performed as in B, except that equal amounts of protein in cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. membranes were then probed with anti-GBF1, anti-NS5 and anti-tubulin antibodies. inoculum was replaced with prewarmed medium (24, 36, and 48 h samples) for the 12 h sample, cells were incubated 12 h in the presence of DMSO or GCA, and then intracellular RNA was harvested. NS2A in DMSO-treated cells at 12 h was set to 1 for each experiment. DENV virions rely wholly on clathrin-mediated endocytosis for uptake into cells. NS5 was also absent from the IgG control. NS5 was also absent from the IgG control. the presence of GCA in the first 12 h postinfection significantly inhibited DENV infection. if, however, the infection was allowed to proceed for 12 h before the GCA pulse, infection was inhibited to a lesser extent. the levels of intracellular DENV RNA still increased almost 100-fold between 12 h and 24 h postinfection. cells were transduced with nonreplicating lentiviral vectors harboring either nonsilencing control shRNA, or shRNA targeting GBF1. t-tests were performed on the 2CT values, as described under \u201cExperimental Procedures\u201d. n.s., not significant; RQ, relative quantification. n.s., not significant; RQ, relative quantification. the IC50 values were significantly different between the two cell lines. the IC50 values were calculated by calculating the IC50 value of each experiment. reducing the level of GBF1 would affect the ability of GCA to inhibit DENV infection. we performed dose-response experiments to determine the half maximum inhibitory concentration (IC50) of GCA to inhibit DENV infection in control versus GBF1-KD cells. reducing the level of GBF1 sensitizes DENV infection of cells to GCA. the extent of Golgi dispersal in cells treated with 1 m GCA was the same as that in cells treated with 10 m GCA (data not shown) the extent of Golgi dispersal in cells treated with 1 m GCA was the same as that in cells treated with 10 m GCA (data not shown). thus, 1 m GCA is sufficient to fully disrupt Golgi morphology, but not sufficient to inhibit DENV infection. the I-DIRT approach is a powerful technique for discriminating interactions occurring prelysis from those occurring postlysis. metabolically light cells were transfected with constructs driving the expression of NS5-GFP, NS3-GFP, or GFP. in parallel, metabolically heavy cells were mock-transfected and then infected with DENV. we relied on the I-DIRT method to address interaction specificity. it allows IPs to be performed in relatively nonstringent conditions. it allows the discrimination of specific from nonspecific interactors. mixed lysate inputs and proteins associated with the tagged viral baits were resolved by SDS-PAGE. in-gel trypsin digestion and C18 clean-up were then performed prior to LC-MS/MS analysis. high confidence interactors were considered to be proteins that passed this cutoff in each of three independent experiments. minimum thresholds required for data to be processed included at least one heavy to light ratio count for each protein group. acceptable peptide and protein FDRs were set to 1% each. complete quantification results for protein groups are shown in supplemental Table S1C. the glu-Fib +2 ion (m/z = 785.8421) was monitored and verified to be within 3 ppm error for all standards. for each set of IPs (NS5-GFP, NS3-GFP, or GFP), the ratio counts used for quantitation of each protein, average light to heavy ratios of each protein, and light to heavy ratio SDs for each protein are given. a mixed lysate input of each NS3-GFP IP is shown in blue triangles. each biological replicate is shown in a different shade of blue. the NS3-GFP bait is also shown. 2, anti-XPO7, anti-SURF4, anti-DHCR7, anti-UBXD8, and anti-HSPD1 were excluded from further analysis. the 12 remaining candidates were involved in diverse processes, including membrane trafficking between the ER and the Golgi (GBF1 and ZW10), nuclear transport (IPO4 and XPOT), the unfolded protein response (SERPINH1, HSP70, HSP27, HSP90, and HSP90), and transcriptional regulation cell lysates were prepared from deNV-infected HepG2 cells. immunoprecipitations with antibodies cross-linked to Protein G-Dynabeads. bound proteins were eluted in loading sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE. membranes were then immunoblotted with the designated antibodies. a panel of 8 KD cell lines inducibly expressed shRNA against a high confidence NS5 and/or NS3 interactor was generated by lentiviral transduction. cells were incubated in doxycycline (2 g/ml) for 96 h to induce shRNA expression and then infected with DENV. CAD, DHCR7, only NS5-GFP (MTOR, SPTLC1), and only NS3-GFP (DPM1, HSPD1, SERPINH1 and ZW10) were transduced with nonreplicating lentiviral vectors harboring shRNA targeting one of the host genes. the extent of host gene silencing in each KD cell line was determined by qPCR. acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis (q 0.05, NS5 and NS3), fatty-acyl-CoA metabolism (q 0.05, NS3) and long-chain fatty-acyl-CoA metabolism (q 0.05, NS5 and NS3) all significantly enriched. deNV subverts fatty acid biosynthetic pathway for RC biogenesis (3). NS5 and NS3 RCs are assembled on remodeled host ER membranes. NS5 also undergoes both nuclear import (55) and export (56) both the nuclear pore and the nuclear envelope were significantly enriched (q 0.02). BFA targets multiple ARF-GEFs, including GBF1 (62), whereas GCA specifically targets GBF1 (63). treatment with either compound reduced the level of intracellular DENV RNA 10-fold. treatment with either compound reduced the level of intracellular DENV RNA 10-fold. hepG2 or HEK293 cells were infected with DENV for 1 h (moi = 2\u20135) and then treated with DMSO, BFA (5 g/ml) or GCA (10 m) after 16 h, levels of DENV NS2A were quantified by qPCR. results are expressed as means S.D. of relative quantification values of NS2A (n = 4). n = p 0.05. NS5 interacts with GBF1 but not BIG1. deNV replication is most sensitive to GCA at early time points in infection. cells were prechilled at 4 \u00b0C and then infected with DENV. the presence of coimmunoprecipitated NS5 was analyzed by immunoblotting. GBF1 was efficiently immunoprecipitated from the deNV-infected cell lysate. BIG1 was effectively immunoprecipitated out of the lysate. NS5 was also absent from the IgG control. the presence of GCA in the first 12 h postinfection significantly inhibited DENV infection (p = 0.042) if, however, the infection was allowed to proceed for 12 h before the GCA pulse, infection was inhibited to a lesser extent. the levels of intracellular DENV RNA still increased almost 100-fold between 12 h and 24 h postinfection. DENV infection in GBF1-KD cells is sensitized to GCA in a manner independent of Golgi disruption. the results support the idea that GBF1 plays a proviral role in the DENV life cycle. n.s., not significant; RQ, relative quantification. n.s., not significant; RQ, relative quantification. IC50 values were obtained using log10[GCA] and relative NS2A values using GraphPad Prism. error bars represent the standard error of the mean. the IC50 values were significantly different between the two cell lines. results are representative of two experiments in which cells were incubated in the presence of drugs for 16 h. one experiment in which cells were incubated in the presence of drugs for 1.5 h. we investigated whether reducing the level of GBF1 would affect the ability of GCA to inhibit DENV infection. DMSO-treated cells exhibited a tight, compact Golgi structure. the extent of Golgi dispersal in cells treated with 1 m GCA was the same as that in cells treated with 10 m GCA. this is indicating that GCA-mediated Golgi disruption by itself does not inhibit DENV infection. we focused on DENV NS5 and NS3 proteins essential for DENV replication. only 53 high confidence NS5 interactors, 52 of which were novel, and 41 high confidence NS3 interactors passed our I-DIRT threshold in each of three independent experiments. a dynamically associating contaminant protein should exhibit a constant light to heavy ratio over time. however, such a rapidly exchanging protein is expected to display a decrease in its light to heavy ratio over time until equilibrium is reached. despite these caveats, the frequency with which we validated interactions by reciprocal-coimmunoprecipitation gives us great confidence that although our interactions are not exhaustively comprehensive, they are likely to consist of bona fide interactors. NS5-GFP interaction network identified here was significantly enriched in proteins involved in retrograde Golgi-to-ER transport, including GBF1. discrepancy between magnitudes of DENV inhibition by GCA treatment versus GBF1 KD is caused by incomplete GBF1 KD (Fig. 6A versus Fig. 6A) this model is also in agreement with studies showing that BFA inhibits hepatitis C virus (HCV) to a weaker extent as infection becomes established (73). this model is also in agreement with studies showing that BFA inhibits hepatitis C virus (HCV) to a weaker extent as infection becomes established (73). the requirement for GBF1 is strongest early in DENV infection, and disappears as infection progresses. we also note that ZW10, a validated interactor of NS3 whose knockdown inhibited DENV replication by 70% (Fig. 3) is also involved in trafficking between the ER and the Golgi (77), further supporting the importance of this pathway in DENV infection. a small proportion of the total cellular pool of GBF1 is recruited to DENV RCs. this is because mislocalization of the entire population of GBF1 would presumably drastically affect the integrity of the secretory pathway. only a small proportion of the total population of DENV NS5 resides in RCs. HCV NS5A binds phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase III (PI4KIII) and stimulates its activity (98, 99); PI4KIII is essential for recruiting GBF1 to golgi membranes (100). however, KD of PI4KIII has been shown to have no effect on DENV infection (98). truncated immediately after the HUS domain (residues 1\u2013709), and did not observe any effect. thus, GBF1 likely plays a different role in DENV infection than it does in enterovirus infection. future studies will aim at determining the contribution(s) of GBF1 and/or ARFs to DENV RC biogenesis. GCA-pulse experiments support a model in which GBF1 is required early in DENV infection. the later in infection that BFA is added, the lesser the extent to which virally induced membrane structures are disrupted. this model is in agreement with studies performed with Kunjin virus showing that the later in infection that BFA is added, the lesser the extent to which virally induced membrane structures are disrupted. sphingomyelin (75) is a lipid that has been shown to be up-regulated in DENV-infected cells. the pathogenic bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis co-opts GBF1 and ARF1 to acquire sphingomyelin for its intracellular membranous compartments. another possibility is that NS5 interaction with GBF1 allows DENV to co-opt membrane trafficking pathways to obtain lipids NS5 interactions with regulators of LD metabolism may affect the balance between energy storage and utilization at LDs. current work is focused on addressing these questions. we did not observe any dramatic differences in GBF1 localization in DENV-infected cells compared with mock-infected cells. however, we expect that only a small proportion of the total cellular pool of GBF1 is recruited to DENV RCs. this is because mislocalization of the entire population of GBF1 murine norovirus RCs appear to be derived from cellular membranes originating from the ER (93) the latter is especially interesting, as murine novovirus RCs appear to be derived from cellular membranes originating from the ER (93). the observation that BFA-mediated inhibition of infection is not a property common to all +ssRNA viruses argues against general toxicity and/or broadly inhibitory effects on cellular trafficking being responsible for BFA-mediated inhibition of DENV poliovirus and coxsackie B3 virus express a protein termed 3A that has been shown to bind to the N-terminal portion of GBF1 and recruit it to viral RCs (95, 96, 102, 103). Interestingly, the BFA sensitivity of poliovirus infection could be rescued by a truncated version of GBF1 lacking the Sec7 domain (46) we attempted to rescue the GCA sensitivity of DENV infection by over cells underwent apoptosis as indicated by the accumulation of a poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage product. this observation is consistent with a previous study in which silencing of GBF1 in HepG2 cells was shown to result in cell cycle arrest and extensive apoptotic cell death. however, our data suggest that the essential role of GBF1 in DENV infection 1) occurs early in infection and sphingolipids can induce negative curvature in membranes. sphingomyelin is another lipid that has been shown to be up-regulated in DENV-infected cells. NS5 interaction with GBF1 allows DENV to co-opt pathways to obtain lipids required for RC biogenesis. GBF1 interacts with adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), a lipolytic enzyme required for the metabolism of stored triglycerides. the NS5-GFP interaction data set also contains another interactor of ATGL, UBXD8, which negatively regulates ATGL by dissociating its co-activator (83). however, NS5 interactions with regulators of LD metabolism may affect the balance between energy storage and utilization at LD some +ssRNA viruses, such as HCV (73), poliovirus (89), and deNV (87, 88) are highly sensitive to BFA. but BFA has little to no effect on infection by other +ssRNA viruses. the latter is especially interesting, as murine novovirus RCs appear to be derived from the ER (93) GBF1 has been proposed to contribute to the production of inositol phospholipids, such as phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate, at the viral RC (101) this local lipid production has been shown to also rely on other COPI components, such as ARF1 (101). however, KD of PI4KIII has been shown to have no effect on DENV infection (98). the discrepancy between magnitudes of DENV inhibition by GCA treatment versus GBF1 KD (Fig. 5A versus Fig. 6A) is caused by incomplete GBF1 KD. at later time points, cells underwent apoptosis as indicated by the accumulation of a poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage product. the best characterized function of GBF1 is to activate ARF proteins. NS5 recruits GBF1 to DENV RCs, where GBF1-activated ARF indirectly influences the lipid composition of the surrounding membranes. one possibility is that NS5 recruits GBF1 to DENV RCs. NS5-GFP interaction data set also contains another interactor of ATGL. this negatively regulates ATGL by dissociating its co-activator. NS5 interactions with regulators of LD metabolism may affect the balance between energy storage and utilization at LDs. the entire population of GBF1 in deNV-infected cells would presumably drastically affect the integrity of the secretory pathway. only a small proportion of the total population of DENV NS5 resides in RCs, with the rest localizing to the nucleus (55, 59) poliovirus (46, 94, 95), coxsackie B3 virus (related to poliovirus) (96), and mouse hepatitis coronavirus (97) do not all appear to usurp GBF1 in the same manner. no interactions between any HCV protein and GBF1 have been described. for the enteroviruses, GBF1 appears to play some role in viral RNA replication. GBF1 likely plays a different role in DENV infection than it does in enterovirus infection. future studies will aim at determining the contribution(s) of GBF1 and/or ARFs to DENV RC biogenesis."}
