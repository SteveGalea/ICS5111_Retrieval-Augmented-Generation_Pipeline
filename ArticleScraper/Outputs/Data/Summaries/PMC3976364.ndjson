{"summary": "the novel H7N9 virus causes severe illness, including pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, with high rates of mortality. two radiologic scores were calculated, one using chest radiography and one using CT. follow-up CT scans at discharge were analyzed in 12 patients of the survival group. the first documented case of human infection with the avian-origin influenza virus, H7N9, occurred in the spring of 2013. the world health organization (WHO) reported 131 laboratory-confirmed cases, including 32 deaths. on admission, 108 patients (97.3%) had findings consistent with pneumonia. 22 patients who fulfilled the clinical criteria for H7N9 influenza infection were hospitalized in the above 6 different institutions. the patient was positive test for H7N9 viral RNA, in throat-swab specimens collected by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) all patients were in-hospital and had undergone chest radiographs and CT scans. three chest radiologists reviewed the images independently initially. findings included ground glass opacity, consolidation, and nodular opacities. hazy areas of increased opacity were defined as focal round opacities. 0 as normal, 1 as 25% abnormality, 2 as 25\u201350% abnormality, 3 as 50\u201375% abnormality, and 4 as >75% abnormality. the four-point scale of the lung parenchyma distribution was then multiplied by the radiologic scale described above (Figure 1). Points from all zones were added for a final cumulative score, with value ranging from 0 to 72. a receiver operating characteristic curve was plotted to determine the appropriate cut-off value with maximum sensitivity and specificity for the endpoint of death. all analyses were considered significant at p values of less than 0.05 (two-tailed) 22 patients who fulfilled clinical criteria for H7N9 influenza infection were hospitalized in the above 6 different institutions. the types of scanners and protocols used for the CT scans varied since they were from 6 different institutions. the technical parameters included 0.75 mm or 1 mm collimation at 5\u20137 mm intervals. follow-up scans were obtained at discharge from 12 patients. images were obtained with both mediastinal and parenchymal window settings. the hounsfield units of normal attenuation, ground-glass attenuation and consolidation areas were measured. each lung zone, with a total of six lung zones in each patient, was assigned a following scale according to distribution of the affected lung parenchyma. the four-point scale of the lung parenchyma distribution was then multiplied by the radiologic scale described above. Statistical analysis All data were expressed as mean standard deviation (SD), or median and interquartile range (IQR) for the continuous variables. the comparison of continuous variables between groups was performed using the Mann-Whitney U test. all the patients in mortality group developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and required mechanical ventilation. survival group 33% (5/15) developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (P = 0.004) and 27% (4/15) required mechanical ventilation (P = 0.005) only two patients in mortality group required invasive mechanical ventilation. the predominant chest radiographic findings at presentation consisted of a bilateral mixed pattern of ground glass opacity and areas of consolidation in 18 patients (82%), air bronchograms in 11 patients (50%), and both central and peripheral distribution in 21 patients (95%). a small pleural effusion was found in 9 patients (41%). the mediastinal lymphadenopathies, pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum were not seen on chest radiographs. the mean chest radiographic score of the mortality group (Figure 2) was 50% higher compared to survival group (Figure 3). there was no statistically significant difference in the frequency and distribution of the chest radiographic findings between the survival and mortality groups. CT features all patients Survival Group Mortality Group N = 22 N = 15 N = 7 Symptom onset before CT, median(IQR), days 7(3\u20139) 7(4\u20139) 6(4\u20138) GGO 1(5) 1(7) 0 Consolidation 1(5) 0 1(14) Both of GGO and consolidation 20(91) 14(93) 6(86) CT score, median(IQR) 21(15\u201324) 18(11\u201323) 27(21\u201333) the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.833 (95% confidence interval: 0.659, 1). there was no statistically significant difference in the frequency and distribution of the CT findings between the survival and mortality groups. Lymphadenopathy 1(8) 1(8) Pleural effusions 7(58) 9(75) Unilateral 4(33) 8(67) Bilateral 3(25) 1(8) Anatomic sides involved Unilateral 1(8) 2(17) Both central and peripheral 12(100) 10(83) Involved zone Upper 10(83) 8(67) Middle 12(100) 11(92) Lower 12(100) 12(100) *P0.05 versus survival group. patients with H1N1 pneumonia or SARS who died were significantly older than those who survived. acute respiratory distress syndrome is a strong predictor of mortality. overall initial chest radiographic and CT scores were 50% higher in mortality group than in survivors. mixed pattern of ground glass opacities and consolidation, air bronchogram, and small pleural effusion were of consistent common radiographic and CT features in both survival and mortality group. findings consistent with the first report indicating that all three patients had coexisting ground glass opacities and consolidation on radiographs or CT on day 7 after the onset of illness. in this study, we evaluated the prognostic implication of both chest radiographic and CT scores assessed by determining the extent of patchy areas of ground-glass attenuation mixed with consolidation. the chest radiographic and CT scores could help perform risk stratification. high initial chest radiographic or CT score in patients with avian influenza H7N9 pneumonia is associated with mortality. risk stratification based on air-space disease may help triage patients, guide treatment, and monitor disease progression and treatment response."}
