{"summary": "the first 79 SARS patients who lived at Amoy Gardens were admitted to the united Christian Hospital in Hong Kong. their initial clinical signs and symptoms and progress have been previously reported (7). nasopharyngeal viral load was measured as previously described (7,8) in block E unit 7 (E7, floor 16) infected his brother (4), our first patient. Factor E block patients (n = 53) Non-E block patients (n = 26) p value Age, y, mean (SD) 40.6 (11.9) 37.1 (10.6) 0.21 Male:female ratio 25:28 13:13 0.81 Duration of symptoms to admission (days), mean (SD) 2.4 (1.2) 2.5 (1.2) 0.72 Coexisting conditions including chronic hepatitis B, no. (%) 11 (19.6) 8 (30.8) 0.33 Chronic hepati median nasopharyngeal viral load in nasopharyngeal patients (5.09 log10 copies/mL) was much higher than in non-E block patients (0 log10 copies/mL) on admission, no statistically significant differences were found between E block and non-E block patients. number of days from onset of symptoms to collection of nasopharyngeal samples was 3.22 (1.5) no correlation was found between initial nasopharyngeal viral load and time elapsed from symptom onset date to the day of sample collection. the highest rate was in block E, which accounted for 79% of all deaths. the death rate in patients living in E7 was 70% (7 patients) this rate is significantly higher than in other units (p = 0.001 by 2 test) the highest nasopharyngeal viral load was detected in patients residing in E7 and E8, which were near the unit inhabited by the index patient. more patients and higher viral load were found in patients living in block D than block F, in block C than block G, and in block B than blocks A and H. patients living in block D had a lower viral load than those living in blocks B and C. this distribution may be the result of a dilution effect as the virus-laden plume rose from the middle floors to the higher floors. however, the death rate was higher in block E patients. the overcrowded housing complex, unconnected pipes, a southwestward wind, rodent pests, and arrival of the SARS index patient all created an environment favorable for the transmission of this disease. the possibilities of different modes of spread alert us to the importance of a multicomponent infection control policy."}
