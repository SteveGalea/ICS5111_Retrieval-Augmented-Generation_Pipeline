{"summary": "Hantaan virus (HTNV) is among the most prevalent HFRS-causing hantaviruses with a case fatality rate of between 1\u201315%. there are currently no FDA licensed vaccines or therapeutics for either HFRS or HPS. ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) have become a popular animal model for a number of respiratory pathogens. they have recently been described as a disease model of two hemorrhagic fever viruses. most hantavirus-related human disease occurs by aerosolized transmission of the virus from the excreta or secreta of infected rodents. marmosets have been used as a disease model for other viral agents including dengue virus [22], Hepatitis C virus [23], influenza virus [24], Lassa fever virus [25], orthopox viruses [26\u201328], Rift Valley Fever virus [29], Eastern Equine Encephalitis virus [30], and filoviruses [31]. this is the first report of hantavirus infection in marmosets. HTNV and PUUV strain K27 were aliquoted and stored at -60\u00b0C or colder. Virus identity has been confirmed by sequencing of the stocks. previously stated methods of anesthesia were limited to 7% of a hamster\u2019s total blood volume per week. animals were housed in small animal pans, not exceeding four animals to a pan. animals had pelleted food and water provided ad libitum. animals were monitored daily during the experiment. adult, female neutered and descented ferrets were anesthetized by inhalation of vaporized isoflurane. intraperitoneal injections consisted of 1 ml delivered with a 3 mL syringe and a 23-guage needle. microchips were used to identify and ascertain temperature during ferret experiments. the experiment will have odds about 9:1 in favor of producing at least one diseased ferret. failure to observe any diseased ferret in a group of four will yield a 95% confidence interval extending from 0\u201350%. for each experiment pre-sera from animals served as a negative control. animals were observed daily by trained personnel in addition to general husbandry assessments. animals found moribund would be euthanized under humane endpoint criteria. no additional pain relief, aside from anesthesia, was necessary. a sample was considered positive if its peak optical density (OD) value was greater than either 0.025 or the background value whichever was higher. HTNV-infected monolayers were fixed 7 days post-infection, while PUUV-infected monolayers were fixed 10 days post infection by 2 mL of 10% formalin per well. immunoostaining was performed as previously described. for HTNV, primer sequences were 594F 5'-AAG CAT GAA GGC AGA AGA GAT -3' and 830R 5'-TAG TCC CTG TTT GTT GCA GG-3' for PUUV, primer sequences were 181F 5'-AGG CAA CAA CAA ACA GTG TCA GCA-3' and 334R 5'-GCA TTC ACA TCA AGG ACA TTT CCA TA the volume of cEMEM in the flask was raised to 3.5 mL with fresh media. Approximately 200 g of organ tissue were homogenized in 1 mL of cEMEM media. HTNV-infected monolayers were fixed 7 days post-infection, while PUUV-infected monolayers were fixed 10 days post infection by 2 mL of 10% formalin per well. paraffin embedded tissue sections of 5\u20136 m were cut and mounted on glass slides, stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), and mounted under a glass coverslip for routine histologic evaluation. the paraffin-embedded tissues used for producing the slides were also used for immunohistochemistry (IHC) studies in the hamsters. ferrets were administered a loading dose of 30 mg/kg on day 41 post infection. maintenance doses of 30 mg/kg were administered every other day until euthanasia. guinea pig setting was used for the white blood cell differential (WBC) in hamsters. luciferase is pseudotyped with the Hantaan glycoprotein. first, heat-inactivated sera was diluted 1:10. followed by five-fold serial dilutions. this mixture was mixed with an equal volume of Eagle\u2032s minimum essential medium. t-test and Mann-Whitney tests were used to compare white blood cell levels pre- and post-Cyp administration. standard deviation of data was assessed to ensure data was normally distributed prior to use of Student\u2019s t-test. hamster procedures Female Syrian hamsters 6\u20138 wks of age were anesthetized by inhalation of vaporized isoflurane using an IMPAC 6 veterinary anesthesia machine. intramuscular injections consisted of 0.2 ml delivered with a 1ml syringe with a 25-gauge, 5/8 in needle. hamster sample size justification Groups of 10 hamsters were used to determine the infectious dose 50% (ID50) and 99% (ID99) a minimum of 3 groups spanning infection rates 0\u2013100% with 10 animals per group yield stable estimates of the values. animals were randomized upon receipt into experimental groups. ferrets were socially housed in metal caging, two to a cage. each cage had a nesting box with bedding material, and numerous tubes and shelfs for play. animals were injected with the indicated concentration of virus diluted in PBS. blood sampling from a femoral vein occurred under previously stated methods of anesthesia. animals were housed in containment as previously described. ELISA The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) used to detect nucleocapsid protein (N) specific antibodies (N-ELISA) was described previously. a sample was considered positive if its peak optical density (OD) value was greater than either 0.025 or the background value. RNA was homogenized in 1.0 mL of TRIzol (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA) reagent. RNA was extracted from TRIzol per manufacturer\u2019s protocol. real-time PCR was conducted on a BioRad CFX thermal cycler. the volume of cEMEM in the flask was raised to 3.5 mL. on days 7, 11, 14, 17, 21 and 28 1.2 mL of culture supernatant was collected and frozen down. the protocol was identical except for equivalent amounts of virus being spiked into either media alone (control), or the 1:10\u20131:1,000 dilution of organ homogenate. PUUV-infected monolayers were fixed 10 days post-infection by 2 mL of 10% formalin per well. hamsters and ferrets had samples of intestine, adrenal gland, pituitary gland, and eye. tissue sections were pretreated with proteinase K for 6 min at room temperature, rinsed, and then covered with primary antibody. slides were rinsed, and substrate-chromogen solution (3,3\u2019-diaminobenzidine; Dako, Santa Clara, CA) was applied for 5 min. ferrets were injected i.p. with water soluble Cyp (Baxter Health Care Corporation, Deerfield, IL) with the indicated dosages per body weight hematology Blood samples of 0.5 mL were collected in lithium heparin capillary blood collection tubes. the dog setting was used for the complete blood count (CBC) and the guinea pig setting was used for the white blood cell differential (WBC) in hamsters. the values were graphed using GraphPad Prism (version 7) and used to calculate the percent neutralization normalized to cells alone and pseudovirions alone as the minimum and maximum signals. the percentage neutralization values for duplicate serial dilutions were plotted. 20 hamsters were exposed to serial ten-fold dilutions of either HTNV or PUUV through either the i.m. or i.n. route. between 28\u201335 days post infection hamsters were terminally bled with infection status monitored by N-ELISA titers. from these data the doses required to infect 50% (ID50) and 99% (ID99) were calculated. groups of three hamsters were euthanized to monitor viral and serological parameters. seroconversion occurred, at least partially, by day 17 post HTNV infection and day 24 post PUUV infection. viral genome was recovered from all hamsters euthanized that day. hamsters were infected either 10 PFU HTNV i.m., 500 PFU HTNV i.n., 1000 PFU PUUV i.m. or 1000 PFU PUUV i.n. hamsters were terminally bled at various points post infection. spleen samples from i.m. and i.n. infected hamsters were spiked with HTNV prior to RT-PCR. no significant inhibition of the spiked RNA was noted. HTNV infection does not result in virus dissemination to the spleen. s was transient after i.m. infection, occurring between day 11\u201317 for the heart, liver, kidney and brain, with no virus detected in the spleen. a small amount of viral genome detected in the brain of a PUUV i.n. infected hamster, 28 days post challenge, is the only viral genome detected in any organ at any time point post PUUV i.n. infection. infected hamsters were markedly lower, with infectious virus detected only in the kidney on day17 and 28 post infection. no infectious virus was recovered from the organ of any PUUV infected hamster. HTNV infection does not result in viral dissemination to the spleen. patients infected with HFRS hantaviruses exhibit leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia during infection. at every time point post infection, EDTA-treated whole blood from HTNV and PUUV exposed hamsters was evaluated. no significant histopathological findings were noted in the kidney or brain. an additional hamster had minimal alveolar edema but not pulmonary infiltrates. such findings suggest a response to antigenic stimulus. immunohistochemistry staining was uniformly negative in all tissues on day 1 post challenge. 0 806 0 0 0 0 0 7 807 0 0 0 0 0 1+/m 0 808 0 0 0 0 0 809 1+/e 0 0 11 810 2+/e 0 2+/e,p 0 1+/m 2+/e,p 0 0 0 0 812 1+/e 1+/m 0 0 0 17 813 3+/e four ferrets were exposed to either 2,000 PFU HTNV or PUUV K27 i.n. no seroconversion occurred within 35 days post infection. the same animals were re-exposed to either 200,000 PFU HTNV, 94,000 PFU PUUV Beaumont or 164,000 PFU PUUV Seloignes by i.m. EDTA treated blood was analyzed weekly for evidence of leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia. none was observed nor serum viremia detected by RT-PCR. the same animals were challenged with either 2,000 PFU HTNV i.n. or 2,000 PFU PUUV i.n. the organs of infected ferrets were analyzed for viral load by RT-PCR. the lung, liver, spleen, intestine and urine of HTNV infected ferrets were negative for viral genome. the heart, lung, kidney, intestine and urine of PUUV infected ferrets were negative for viral genome. ferrets were infected with 94,000 PFU PUUV Beaumont i.m. on day 0. HTNV and PUUV infected ferrets experienced weight loss. no further immunosuppression studies were carried out in ferrets. PUUV infection occurs in between 94\u2013100% (proteinuria) and 58\u201385% (hematuria) of human clinical cases. no prolonged proteinuria or hematuria was observed in infected ferrets. blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels in the sera remain unchanged. two of four ferrets had proliferative cortical cells in either the adrenal capsule or adrenal cortex that were likely clinically silent as they lack clinical signs consistent with adrenal\u2013associated endocrinopathy. alveolar mineralization was noted in all four ferrets as was eosinophilic and lymphoplasmacytic enteritis, and hepatitis. three marmosets were infected with 1,000 PFU HTNV i.m. Sera was collected weekly to monitor seroconversion. no infectious virus or viral genome was detected in the heart, lung, liver, spleen, kidney, intestine or brain. groups of 10 to 20 hamsters were exposed to serial ten-fold dilutions of either HTNV or PUUV by either the i.m. or i.n. route. between 28\u201335 days post infection, hamsters were terminally bled with infection status monitored by N-ELISA titers. from these data the doses required to infect 50% (ID50) and 99% (ID99) were calculated. hamsters were challenged with either 10 PFU (3 ID99) HTNV i.m., 500 PFU (1.5 ID99) HTNV i.n., 1,000 PFU (1 ID99) PUUV i.m., or 1,000 PFU (1 ID99) PUUV i.n. on various days post infection, groups of three hamsters were euthanized to monitor viral and serological parameters. HTNV and PUUV infected hamsters were seronegative by the i.m. route. infection via the i.m. route led to a more robust neutralizing antibody response than then i.n.route. low levels of viral genome were detected between days 11 and 24 post infection in the liver of HTNV i.m. but not i.n. infected hamsters. spleen samples from i.m. and i.n. infected hamsters were spiked with HTNV. a small amount of viral genome detected in the brain of a PUUV i.n. infected hamster, 28 days post infection, is the only viral genome detected in any organ at any time point post PUUV i.n. infection. the presence of viral genome was sporadically detected in the urine of HTNV infected hamsters between days 17\u201328. hamster after 17 days post infection, infectious virus was recovered from the lung, liver, brain and spleen in only a portion of hamsters at each time point. no infectious virus was detected in the heart at any time point. HTNV infection does not result in viral dissemination to the spleen. all samples whose cell supernatant became RT-PCR positive post infection were positive for infectious virus by plaque assay. the one sample whose cell supernatant did not convert to RT-PCR positive, remained negative for infectious virus by plaque assay. 4 post infection 66% (12/18) hamsters exhibit minimal (likely subclinical) respiratory lesions consisting of interstitial neutrophilic and histiocytic infiltrates in the lungs. 44% (8/18) also exhibit minimal alveolar edema but not pulmonary infiltrates. 0 0 0 0 0 802 0 0 0 0 0 803 0 0 0 0 0 804 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 805 0 1+/m 0 0 0 806 0 0 0 0 7 807 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 809 1+/e,p 0 0 1+/e,p 0 1+ ferret model of HTNV and PUUV infection No published studies detail if ferrets are susceptible to hantavirus infection. four ferrets were exposed to either 2,000 PFU HTNV or PUUV K27 i.n. no seroconversion occurred within 35 days post infection. EDTA treated blood was analyzed weekly for evidence of leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia. none was observed nor serum viremia detected by RT-PCR. the same animals were challenged with either 2,000 PFU HTNV i.n. or 2,000 PFU PUUV i.n. animals were euthanized between 3 and 7 days post administration of Cyp. the organs of infected ferrets were analyzed for viral load by RT-PCR. no infectious virus was found in the organ of any ferret by plaque assay. immunosupression was discontinued and 5 mg/kg enrofloxicin was given twice daily for a week. on day 11 immunosupression resumed for two doses with prophylactic enrofloxicin. ferrets spiked fevers within a few days post the second round of immunosuppressive treatment. dotted line represents the limit of dectection for the PRNT assay (20), the PsVNA assay (20) and the N-ELISA (2log10) no signs of renal impairment were observed. proteinuria and hematuria are hallmarks of PUUV infection occurring in between 94\u2013100% (proteinuria) and 58\u201385% (hematuria) of human clinical cases. one ferret had mild neutrophilic and histiocytic inflammation centered on the bronchioles and expanded alveolar septa. a number of other common or age-associated lesions were observed in the ferrets. two of four ferrets had proliferative cortical cells in either the adrenal capsule or adrenal cortex. three marmosets were infected with 1,000 PFU HTNV i.m. sera was collected weekly to monitor seroconversion. no infectious virus or viral genome was detected in the heart, lung, liver, spleen, kidney, intestine or brain. the use of adult animal models to evaluate anti-HTNV and anti-PUUV medical counter measures has been limited. the ability of passively administered neutralizing antibodies has been evaluated in the high-dose hamster model of HTNV and PUUV. in PUUV challenged cynomolgus macaques PUUV. the lower ID99 doses suggest that HTNV is more infectious than PUUV in the hamster. lethal infection of hamsters with ANDV leads to extensive organ dissemination, with infectious virus recovered in the lung, liver, kidney, spleen and heart. low dose HTNV hamster model mimics infection pattern of virus in host species. virus is detectable by RT-PCR around day 11 post infection. virus is cleared from all organs except the lung by day 24. the PRNT assay was slightly more sensitive than the N-ELISA assay. detecting neutralizing antibodies in all animals with N-ELISA titers. the increased time, sample, and biosafety requirements necessary for a PRNT assay make the N-ELISA a better choice. ferrets were exposed to PUUV K27, a commonly used laboratory isolate. repeated passaging of hantavirus is known to cause mutations. despite the high challenge dose and use of recent isolates, no elevation in white blood cells was observed. lack of viral antigen and pathology in any of the ferret organs examined is surprising. lack of viral antigen and pathology suggests either a transient infection cleared prior to Day 35 post infection. the animals gained weight until 3 days post challenge, at which point a gradual weight loss occurs, regardless of if HTNV or PUUV was the challenge virus. PUUV infected ferrets exhibited the same gradual weight loss. no prolonged signs of clinical kidney failure were observed. the cause of the weight loss remains undetermined. marmosets represent an attractive model for testing vaccines and therapeutics against HFRS-causing hantaviruses due to genetic similarities to humans and small size. marmosets represent an attractive model for testing vaccines and therapeutics against HFRS-causing hantaviruses. marmosets develop exceptionally high neutralizing antibody titers. serum viremia is significantly lower than in hamsters infected with HTNV. hamsters infected with ANDV showed RT-PCR titers of >7log10. hamsters infected with ANDV showed titers of >7log10. HTNV has an ID50 of >10,000, making it a much less effective route of infection. the lower ID99 doses suggest that HTNV is more infectious than PUUV in the hamster. the mechanism for this difference between these closely related hantaviruses remains unknown. low dose HTNV hamster model mimics the infection pattern of the virus in its host species, the striped field mouse (Apodemus agrarius), with viral genome being detected in the lung, liver and kidney but not the spleen. in PUUV i.m. infected hamsters virus is detectable by RT-PCR around Day 11 post infection. the distribution of PUUV in the hamster differs somewhat from its host species the bank vole. it is found to persist in the lung, spleen and kidney, and was not detected in the heart or the brain. the PRNT assay was slightly more sensitive than the N-ELISA assay. detecting neutralizing antibodies in all animals with N-ELISA titers make the N-ELISA a better choice. s to 2,000 PFU i.n. (greater than the ID99 for both viruses in hamsters) failed to result in a productive infection and seroconversion. instead i.m. challenge doses of 100,000\u2013200,000 PFU were needed. PUUV K27 has been in cell culture for over 15 years. acute kidney injury and vision disturbances including blurred vision, myopic shift, and lens thickening. pulmonary involvement including pleural effusion and vascular effusion occurred less frequently. lack of viral antigen and pathology in any of the ferret organs examined is rather surprising. the use of Cyp is well documented in ferrets, primarily given at a high dose as an emetic, and no dosage for long term immunosuppression was found. the dosages used in this study successfully reduced white blood cell levels, in ferrets, and demonstrate that Cyp can be used to induce long-term immunosuppression if antibiotics are given to control for secondary infection. marmosets represent an attractive model for testing vaccines and therapeutics against HFRS-causing hantaviruses. the marmoset model is more similar to the ferret HFRS-causing hantavirus infection model than the hamster. marmosets develop exceptionally high neutralizing antibody titers (10,240\u201320,480 by PRNT50 and 14,866\u2013221,557 by PsVNA50) the serum viremia is significantly lower than in hamsters infected with HTNV, where some animals displayed RT-PCR titers of >7log10. no sera was available for one hamster in the day 28 HTNV i.m. group. hamsters sacrificed on days 17\u201328 had their sera screened for neutralizing activity by PRNT. the mean titer is displayed for each group and the limit of detection for the assay (20) is depicted by a dashed line. HTNV and PUUV infection do not lead to changes in hematological parameters. hamsters were infected either 10 PFU HTNV i.m., 500 PFU HTNV i.n., 1000 PFU PUUV i.m. or 1000 PFU PUUV i.n. representatives images of organs from normal and day 28 are shown. HTNV or PUUV infection does not cause any changes in white blood cell levels. ferrets were challenged with either 200,000 PFU HTNV, 94,000 PFU PUUV Beaumont, or 164,000 PFU of PUUV Seloignes i.m. POS is virus spiked into water to serve as a control. Ferrets were challenged with either 200,000 PFU HTNV, 94,000 PFU PUUV Beaumont or 164,000 PFU of PUUV Seloignes i.m. and immunosuppressed with 30 mg/kg Cyp every other day beginning on day 41. for a standard plaque assay the limit of detection, 1.7 log10, is depicted as a dashed line in (A) the line is amount of HTNV plaques obtained when spiked into media rather than organ homogenate. in (B) the line is amount of HTNV plaques obtained when spiked into media rather than organ homogenate. ferrets were infected with 94,000 PFU PUUV Beaumont i.m. heart (A), lung (B), liver (C), spleen (D), kidney (E), intestine (F), brain (G), and eye (H) were collected on day 35 post infection and assayed for viral genome by RT-PCR. ferrets were euthanized 35 days post a 94,000 PUUV Beaumont i.m. challenge. heart, lung, liver, kidney, spleen, small intestine, adrenal gland, pituitary gland, cerebellum and cerebrum were evaluated by H&E. the limit of detection, 1.7 log10, is depicted as a dashed line in (A) three marmosets were infected with 1,000 PFU HTNV i.m. on day 30 organs were harvested. the presence of viral genome was determined by RT-PCR."}
