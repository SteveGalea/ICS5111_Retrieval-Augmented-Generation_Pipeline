{"summary": "the health stakeholders are under continuous pressure to improve the efficiency of healthcare systems through quality assurance evaluations of clinical, governmental, and operational key performance indicators. this task demands concentrated efforts geared toward: (1) development of health policies, (2) maintenance of public health promotion/disease prevention programs, (3) conduct of health-related research and (4) delivery of health education training. dual-degree MD-MPH programs offer concurrent solid core training in medicine and public health. dual-degree MD-MPH programs extend numerous benefits to its matriculating medical students, specifically, and communities at large. the curriculum of dual-degree MBBS-MPH programs in Saudi Arabia should not be viewed as an impossible mission and get rejected immediately. the basic curriculum of dual-degree MBBS-MPH programs should be modeled based on the well-established MD-MPH programs elsewhere in the united states. the length of the dual-degree program may be extended for one more year if needed (a total of 7 years), although it is not necessarily required. the MBBS-MPH degree requirements will be horizontally integrated throughout the MBBS program and will include three components. Getting into specifics, the core public health courses should be completed during the pre-clerkship phase. dual-degree MD-MPH programs offer concurrent solid core training in medicine (clinical skills) and public health (basic academic research skills and the art of disease treatment/prevention) dual-degree MD-MPH programs extend numerous benefits to its matriculating medical students, specifically, and communities, at large. MBBS-MPH programs should be modeled based on the well-established MD-MPH programs elsewhere in the united states. the curricular design of dual-degree programs will not experience a dramatic deviation from the traditional 6-year MBBS program. the length of the dual-degree program may be extended for one more year if needed. the public health concentration areas should be specifically tailored to the ones that meet the country-specific healthcare challenges and priorities. the practicum experience should take place during the clerkship years, through organized activities during family medicine/preventive medicine clinical rotations. the thesis should reflect culmination of the entire MPH educational experience, that is, applying the knowledge gained from course work and practicum experience into a scholarly communication. dual-degree MBBS-MPH programs imply an arduous educational training in both medicine and public health. enrollment into such programs may be limited to a very finite number of students, at least during the initial implementation stages. dual-degree MBBS-MPH programs are the way forward. they are expected to encourage more positive tendency toward pursing family, community, and rural medicine careers to meet the country's demands for primary healthcare."}
