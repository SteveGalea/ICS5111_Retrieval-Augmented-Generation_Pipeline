{"summary": "a substantial portion of febrile episodes in sub-Saharan africa are likely caused by pathogens other than Plasmodium. emerging and reemerging infectious diseases are caused by a variety of pathogenic organisms, are increasing in frequency, and often occur in areas with limited disease surveillance. xenosurveillance is a sensitive and effective means of detecting pathogens in blood samples collected by mosquitoes at clinically and operationally relevant concentrations and timescales. the ability of this method to detect human parasites and bacteria remains unknown. larvae were reared at 28\u201331\u00b0C and fed fish food daily. adults were held in 80% relative humidity on a 14:10 light:dark photoperiod. mosquitoes were anesthetized with triethylamine and bloodmeals were removed from the abdomen. forceps were used to push the blood bolus onto the FTA card. each FTA card was left to dry overnight at room temperature and moved to storage in a 80\u00b0C freezer for 2 weeks. qRT-PCR analysis of RNA extracted from 50 L of undiluted stock agent. the volume of 2 L was chosen because it is the approximate volume of a mosquito bloodmeal. mosquitoes were sampled at 6-hour time points up to 24 hours to determine how long pathogen RNA could be detected. qRT-PCR was chosen over quantitative PCR. extracted RNA from each pathogen culture/stock was reverse transcribed with a forward primer containing a T7 transcription site on the 5\u2032 end. subsequent DNA was transcribed using the MEGAscript T7 Transcription kit (ThermoFisher) in a bloodmeal (i.e., bacteremia, parasitemia, and viremia) to be detectable by xenosurveillance 50% of the time. qRT-PCR = real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; T.b.g. = Trypanosoma brucei gambiense. Mosquitoes and microbes. o mosquitoes were derived from the laboratory G3 strain (origin The Gambia) or from a recently colonized field strain from Burkina Faso. adult mosquitoes were reared at 28\u201331\u00b0C and fed fish food daily. mosquitoes were anesthetized with triethylamine and bloodmeals were removed from the abdomen. forceps were used to push the blood bolus onto the FTA card. each FTA card was left to dry overnight at room temperature and moved to storage in a 80\u00b0C freezer. qRT-PCR analysis of RNA extracted from 50 L of undiluted stock agent. the volume of 2 L was chosen because it is the approximate volume of a mosquito bloodmeal. mosquitoes were sampled at 6-hour time points up to 24 hours to determine how long pathogen RNA could be detected. qRT-PCR was chosen over quantitative PCR to detect all pathogens assessed using the same methodology. extracted RNA from each pathogen culture/stock was reverse transcribed with a forward primer containing a T7 transcription site on the 5\u2032 end. subsequent DNA was transcribed using the MEGAscript T7 Transcription kit (ThermoFisher) value reflects the amount of pathogen required in a bloodmeal (i.e., bacteremia, parasitemia, and viremia) to be detectable by xenosurveillance 50% of the time. value reflects the amount of pathogen required in a bloodmeal to be detectable by xenosurveillance. xenosurveillance using an. gambiae mosquitoes fed blood containing serial 10-fold dilutions of B. anthracis, T. b. gambiense, MERS-CoV, and ZIKAV. in all cases, genetic signatures of pathogens were detectable by xenosurveillance. input N = 1, dried blood spots N = 3, mosquito DBS N = 5 for each pathogen. vertical dashed lines demarcate each pathogen:blood dilution. shaded areas show reported clinical ranges of parasitemia, bacteremia and viremia. an. gambiae mosquitoes fed blood containing serial 10-fold dilutions of B. anthracis, T. b. gambiense, MERS-CoV, and ZIKAV. genetic signatures of pathogens were detectable by xenosurveillance. input N = 1, dried blood spots N = 3, mosquito DBS N = 5 for each pathogen. vertical dashed lines indicate the lower limit of the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay. xenosurveillance is a useful tool for detecting genetic signatures of human infecting bacteria and parasites. for xenosurveillance to be a useful tool, mosquitoes must feed on a pathogenemic host. transcripts or genomes from these pathogens must be detectable in mosquito bloodmeals. trypanosoma brucei gambiense detection by xenosurveillance resulted in the highest 50% end-point of 1.16 105. xenosurveillance can reliably detect genetic signatures from three separate taxa of pathogens at or below clinically reported pathogenemia. anopheles gambiae mosquitoes were used in this experiment to best replicate field conditions in sub-saharan africa. we demonstrated that xenosurveillance can be used to detect parasites and bacteria in a laboratory setting. recent outbreaks of infectious diseases have demonstrated the need for improved surveillance and pathogen detection strategies. the majority of these systems are dependent on a clinician or health-care provider to report into a larger network. this is problematic in areas like sub-Saharan Africa where less than 20% of febrile episodes come to the attention of any formal health-care system."}
