{"summary": "immune responses to infections of the central nervous system need to be highly regulated in order to limit tissue damage. to control immune function, the CNS displays specialized features, including lack of lymphatic drainage, parenchymal dendritic cells and MHC (major histocompatibility complex) expression, as well as the presence of the BBB (blood brain barrier) MMP inhibition has been associated with leukocyte retention within the perivascular space. decreased MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity by inhibition of extracellular MMP inducer is correlated with higher perivascular cuff density and decreased EAE (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis) severity. cytokines, chemokines and MMPs regulate immune cell migration into the CNS parenchyma. both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells participate in viral clearance, as well as tissue damage. TIMP-1 was not upregulated in astrocytes but specifically expressed by CD4+ T cells within the CNS parenchyma. this suggests that TIMP-1 delays CD4+ T cell migration across the glia limitans. however, virus clearance was not altered in the absence of TIMP-1. the study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations in the National Institute of Health Guide for the care and use of laboratory animals. all procedures were performed in compliance with the Cleveland Clinic Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved protocol number 2011-0553. clinical disease severity was graded daily according to the following scale: 0, healthy; 1, hunched back and ruffled fur; 2, partial hind limb paralysis or inability to maintain the upright position. cells were recovered from the 30/70% interface and washed with the RPMI medium. CNS-derived cells were then resuspended in FACS buffer. cells were incubated with anti-CD45 (clone Ly-5), anti-Ly6G (clone 1A8), anti-CD11b (clone M1/70), anti-F4/80 (Serotec), anti-CD4 (clone GK1.5), anti-CD8 sections were incubated with rabbit anti-mouse laminin and rat anti-mouse CD4 (BD Pharmingen) for 1 h at room temperature, mounted with Vectashield mounting media. brains (at least three per group) were embedded in Tissue-Tek OCT (Sakura Finetex), flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. sections were stained with LFB (Luxol Fast Blue) to quantify areas of demyelination within the white matter tracks. sections at all six levels were analyzed in a blinded manner, scanned with an Aperio ScanScope (Vista) at 40 and digitally imaged at high resolution. percentage of myelin loss within white matter areas was quantified using Aperio Software. ELISA CCL5 and CXCL10 protein levels were measured on brain supernatant using quantikine ELISA. gels were incubated in 1 renaturing buffer (Bio-Rad) for 30 min at room temperature. gels were then stained in 0.25% (w/v) Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Bio-Rad) Graphs were plotted using GraphPad Prism 4.0c software. mouse and virus Homozygous TIMP-1 deficient (TIMP-1/) mice were purchased from the National Cancer Institute. cell pellets were resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.2) and adjusted to 30% Percoll (Pharmacia) a 1 ml 70% Percoll underlay was added prior to centrifugation at 800 g for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. brains were dissected, fixed in 4% PFA for 1 h and incubated in 15% (w/v) sucrose for 30 min at room temperature (20\u00b0C), 20% sucrose for 30 min at 4\u00b0C and 30% sucrose overnight at 4\u00b0C. sections were stored in cryoprotection solution until 30 m sections were prepared using a sliding microtome (Leica Microsystems) Counts from the three regions were totaled and expressed as percentage perivascular CD4/total CD4 for analysis of demyelination. spinal cords were fixed in 10% (w/v) zinc formalin, divided in six sections (from cervical, thoracic and lumbar regions) ELISA CCL5 and CXCL10 protein levels were measured on brain supernatant using quantikine ELISA. lysates were then separated on 10% (w/v) acrylamide gels containing 1% (w/v) gelatin (Bio-Rad) gels were incubated in 1 renaturing buffer (Bio-Rad) for 30 min at room temperature. gels were then stained in 0.25% (w/v) Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Bio-Rad) and destained with the destain solution (Bio-Rad) until bands appeared. RESULTS TIMP-1 deficiency decreases clinical disease without altering virus clearance. data represent the mean of seven experiments with 15\u201320 mice per experiment, **P0.01 and ***P0.001. data represent the averageS.E.M. of six individual mice per group per time point combined from two experiments. decreased disease severity in TIMP-1/ mice may be explained by accelerated parenchymal CD4+ T cell infiltration mediating accelerated local T cell activity and virus control. similar peak virus replication at day 5 p.i. and decline of virus titers at day 7 p.i. with a drop below detection levels by day 14 p.i. decreased CNS IFN production in TIMP-1/ mice was mainly due to limited CD4+ T cell responses. however, this contradicts our initial hypothesis that the absence of TIMP-1 would facilitate CD4+ T cell access into, and thus their effector function, within the CNS parenchyma. TIMP-1 deficiency does not alter CNS inflammation. numbers of total inflammatory leukocytes (CD45hi), neutrophils (ly6G+), monocytes (F4/80+), CD8+ and CD4+ T cells per brain in WT and TIMP-1/ infected mice. CD4+ T cell retention within the perivascular space was nearly increased by 30% in TIMP-1/ mice at day 7 and 10 p.i. however, preferential perivascular accumulation was sustained to day 10 p.i. in the absence of TIMP-1. accumulation of CD4+ T cells in the perivascular space of TIMP-1/ mice correlated with dysregulated chemokine and/or MMP/TIMP expression. but we could not detect significant differences in expression of CXCL10 or CCL5 mRNA or protein, two major chemoattractants of T cells during JHMV infection. TIMP-2, -3 and to a lesser extent TIMP-4 mRNA were constitutively expressed at high levels within the CNS of nave WT mice. TIMP-2 expression in the CNS was reduced after JHMV infection. however, stable TIMP-3 and -4 mRNA expression after JHMV infection was also not altered by the absence of TIMP-1. only a restricted number of MMPs are induced following JHMV infection. the absence of TIMP-1 did not alter the kinetics or levels of MMP-3 and -12 mRNA expression. however, accumulation of CD4+ T cells in the perivascular space of TIMP-1/ mice suggests that CD4+ T cell retention is MMP independent. disease severity was significantly decreased in infected TIMP-1/ compared to WT mice. despite similar virus clearance and extent of demyelination, both groups displayed similar disease severity after day 12 p.i. more severe clinical symptoms, despite accelerated virus control coincident with increased IFN in B7-H1 deficient mice. the participation of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in JHMV clearance and tissue damage constitute additional layers of complexity. limited early IFN levels within the CNS were associated with prolonged attenuated clinical disease in TIMP-1/ mice. reduced IFN implied local T cell stimulation by viral antigen was specifically reduced in the absence of TIMP-1 at the time of maximum T cell migration to the CNS. TIMP-1 deficiency does not alter CNS inflammation. number of total inflammatory leukocytes (CD45hi), neutrophils (ly6G+), monocytes (F4/80+), CD8+ and CD4+ T cells per brain in TIMP-1/ infected mice. decreased IFN, despite similar CD4+ T cell recruitment, suggested reduced CD4+ T cell effector function. this notion was tested by immunohistologic analysis of the distribution of CD4+ T cells in the perivascular space versus parenchyma. the perivascular space versus parenchyma analyzed in WT and TIMP-1/ mice at day 7 and 10 p.i. data represent the meanS.E.M. of six mice per group combined from two separate experiments. CD4+ T cell retention within the perivascular space is not associated with compensation by TIMPs or altered MMP and chemokine expression. expression of MMP inhibitors in the CNS was evaluated in both groups. nave mice express TIMP-1 mRNA at very low levels. peak Timp-1 mRNA at day 7 p.i. correlates with CNS CD4+ T cell recruitment. transcript levels depict the averageS.E.M. of three individual brains per group per time point representative of two separate experiments. MMP9 activity determined by zymography of CNS mononuclear cells isolated from infected WT and TIMP-1/ mice at days 3 and 7 p.i. DISCUSSION Migration of leukocytes into the CNS parenchyma requires penetration of the endothelial layer as well as the glia limitans. this two-step process is highly regulated at several distinct levels involving, integrins, chemokines and MMPs. similar expression patterns of chemokines and MMPs and TIMPs in TIMP-1/ and WT mice support an MMP independent function of TIMP-1 in regulating CD4+ T cell access to the CNS parenchyma. despite a correlation between imbalanced MMP/TIMP activity with several neuroinflammatory disorders, the role of TIMP-1 remains elusive. ases may inactivate function of molecules essential in CD4 T cell migration within the CNS parenchyma. CD63 is upregulated by activated human T cells and acts as a co-stimulatory molecule. however, restimulation of CD4+ T cells upon entry into the CNS might be altered in the absence of TIMP-1 and CD63 complexes. CD4+ T cell helper function to CD8+ T cells thus appeared to be preserved despite altered CD4+ T cell distribution in the absence of TIMP-1. difference between the MMP-independent function of TIMP-1 during JHMV infection and its role in limiting leukocyte access through the BBB. -1 in regulating CD4+ T cell migration across the glia limitans during viral encephalitis. reduced CD4+ T cell access to the CNS parenchyma did not affect viral control, disease severity was reduced. targeting TIMP-1 may represent a therapeutic target to reduce pathogenesis, without altering virus clearance."}
