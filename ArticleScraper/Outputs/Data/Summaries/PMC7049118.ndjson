{"summary": "around 70% of EIDs, and almost all recent pandemics, originate in animals. disease emergence is driven by anthropogenic changes such as deforestation and expansion of agricultural land. the origins of SARS and Ebola viruses have been traced back to bats. goal 3 of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development aims to \"ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all at all ages\" ignoring EID risk might mean overlooking important synergies in the achievement of other goals. policies that promote sustainable land-use planning, reduced deforestation, and biodiversity protection, provide ancillary benefits by reducing the types of wildlife contact that can lead to disease emergence. intact ecosystems may play an important disease regulation role by maintaining natural disease dynamics in wildlife communities and preventing the risk of disease transmission to humans. intact ecosystems may play an important disease regulation role by maintaining natural disease dynamics in wildlife communities and reducing the probability of contact and pathogen transmission among humans, livestock, and wildlife. not controlling epidemics can contribute to the dismantling of societal functions, leading to the exacerbation of violence, sexual exploitation, educational disruption, and corruption. one health strategy has already attracted interest from several developing countries. it can provide a global platform for integrating EID risk mitigation. measures directed at risk mitigation and epidemic threat resilience are mainstreamed through coordination in program design and standards. socioeconomic scenario analysis is widely used in sustainability, biodiversity, and agricultural research. this approach could be built into environmental and social safeguard frameworks, to better anticipate and mitigate the risks and adverse impacts of disease. current economic approaches mostly focus on pandemic insurance. this integration will require a deeper, mechanistic understanding of the complex drivers of disease emergence and more accurate, fine-scale assessment of the regions at highest EID risk. this integration will require a deeper, mechanistic understanding of the complex drivers of disease emergence."}
