{"summary": "increased number of outbreaks of H5 and H7 low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) and high pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) viruses in poultry has major public and animal health implications. serological surveillance represents a powerful and sensitive approach for detecting the presence of avian influenza antibodies in a population. serologic cross-reactivity with antigenically distinct influenza viruses can occur as a consequence of precedent vaccination or exposure, resulting in a more complicated interpretation of the serological findings. lentiviral pseudotypes bearing HA and NA envelope glycoproteins devolved from the rest of the virus are ideal tools to monitor the effects of viral evolution on serological outcomes. izing antibodies against influenza HAs belonging to Influenza Group 1 (HPAI H5N1 clade 1 A/Vietnam/1194/2004 and HPAI clade 2.1.3.2 A/Indonesia/5/2005) and Group 2 (HPAI H7N1 A/chicken/Italy/13474/1999) the presence of neutralising antibodies against two influenza HAs has been evaluated within a single serum sample. sera were provided by the FAO, OIE, and National Reference Laboratory for Newcastle Disease and Avian influenza (Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie) ten sera H5 positive collected from chickens vaccinated with the inactivated H5N2 vaccine (no. 1\u201310) ten sera H7 positive (no. 11\u201320) collected from turkeys during an Italian outbreak caused by an LPAI H7N3 virus (A/turkey firefly Luciferase and Renilla Luciferase H5/H7 Pseudotypes Lentiviral vector (carrying the luciferase reporter gene, pCSFLW) were produced as described previously [23, 24], except that the neuraminidase activity was provided by a cognate NA plasmid in lieu of exogenous bacterial NA addition. the same batch of HEK 293T/17 producer pCSLZW was used in conjunction with the clade 1 A/Vietnam/1194/2004 HA and exogenous bacterial NA to produce lacZ pseudotype viruses. infection of HEK 293T/17 cells was detected using the X-gal substrate as described by us previously. twofold serially diluted serum samples (5 L) were dispensed together with cell culture medium. the neutralizing antibody responses against each subtype were detected by using the Dual-Glo reagent (Promega) the antibody titres for each influenza pseudotype were expressed as geometric mean titer (GMT) radial tree and HA amino acid identity grid were constructed with MATLAB (MathWorks) All avian sera employed in the study were tested by HI at FAO, OIE, and National Reference Laboratory for Newcastle Disease and Avian influenza. ten sera H5 positive collected from chickens vaccinated with the inactivated H5N2 (A/chicken/Hidalgo/28159-232/1994) vaccine. h5n2 (A/turkey/Italy/1980), H7N3 (A/turkey/Italy/9289/V02), H7N9 (A/chicken/Italy/22A/1998), and H7N1 (A/chicken/Italy/1067/1999) were routinely used for avian influenza surveillance in Italy. standard protocols were used as described previously [22]. the titres of influenza pseudotypes were quantified by luminescence expression, expressed as relative luminescence units (RLU) measured by luminometer (GloMAX 96, Promega) two controls were required for the titration: a negative control (cell only) and the -envelope glycoprotein control (No HA and NA) the 50% inhibitory doses (IC50) were determined as the reciprocal of serum dilution resulting in a 50% reduction of a single round of infection (reporter gene mediated signal) the serum dilution resulting in a 50% neutralizing activity reduction for each serum sample was transformed to logarithmic scale. the radial tree and HA amino acid identity grid were constructed with MATLAB (MathWorks) the radial tree and HA amino acid identity grid were constructed with MATLAB (MathWorks) the radial tree and HA amino acid identity grid were constructed with MATLAB (MathWorks) if these assays are to be adopted in these regions in the future, it is assumed that lacZ will be the reporter gene of choice and that these laboratories may have frequent disruptions to ideal pseudotype storage conditions. the initial titre of the H5 lacZ pseudotype was 4.3 105 IFU/mL and >80% infectivity remained after five cycles of freeze-thaw. stability of H5N1 lacZ pseudotypes was evaluated by subjecting aliquots of virus to 5 cycles of freeze-thaw. results for pseudotypes bearing the rabies virus (CVS-11) and HIV-1 envelope proteins are shown for comparison. a panel of ten sera collected from chickens vaccinated with a monovalent inactivated vaccine was run in order to more comprehensively evaluate the utility of this assay in an avian serological setting. ten sera positive by HI test using an H5N2 A/chicken/Italy/1080 reference antigen were also confirmed positive.

GMTs mirrored those obtained with H5N1 pseudotypes (GMTs from 1 : 40 to 1 : 453) with one serum sample (n. H5+7s3) negative (GMT = 10) and two sera at the proposed positive threshold of 1 : 40. values for H7 A/chicken/Italy/13474/99 tested in monoplex and multiplex are reported. the panel of sera was additionally tested against A/Indonesia/5/05. IC50 values for each sera tested by monoplex and multiplex pp-NT assays. rying firefly luciferase and Renilla luciferase gene were calculated and plotted. results were subsequently analyzed by performing Student's t-test. antibody responses against H7 A/chicken/13474/1999 tested in monoplex and multiplex assays. a radial tree shows the relationship between the full-length HA genes of vaccine and serological antigens (MATLAB Software) the phylogenetic relationship between these pseudotype serological antigens and the other antigens used in this study can be visualized on a radial tree in Figure 1. the initial titre of the H5 lacZ pseudotype was 4.3 105 IFU/mL. in parallel, pseudotypes bearing rabies CVS-11 and HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins were subjected to the same freeze-thaw regimen. in parallel, pseudotypes bearing rabies CVS-11 and HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins were subjected to the same freeze-thaw regimen and were found to lose approximately 4% and 9% activity. monoplex pp-NT assay using HPAI H5 and H7 Influenza Pseudotypes. three panels of sera (H5 positive, H7 positive, and 40 negative serum samples) were initially tested using a monoplex pseudotype-based format. an initial pilot study was carried out where H5N1 hyperimmune (SH454) and H7N1 (02/294) sheep sera were tested for the ability to neutralize influenza pseudotypes bearing the HAs from H all ten sera positive by HI test using an H5N2 A/chicken/Italy/1080 reference antigen were also confirmed positive by pp-NT assays. six of ten sera were also found positive with GMT ranging from 1 : 28 to 1 : 113 (Table 1). titres obtained via HI correlated strongly with titres obtained using HPAI H5 pseudotypes belonging to two different clades. clade 1 A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (r = 0.87, P 0.0001) and clade 2.1.3.2 A/Indonesia/5/2005 (r = 0.87, P 0.0002) the absolute titers (expressed as mean SD) of H5 A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (222.96) were significantly lower than those obtained for the same panel tested by A/Indonesia/5/2005 (1206.2). a panel of ten sera (no. 11 to no. 20) were found positive when tested against H7 pseudotypes with GMT range from 1 : 28 to 1 > 2560. only one serum sample was positive (GMT of a comparative serological approach was undertaken to assess whether the results obtained with the pseudotype neutralization assay reflected those obtained with HI test. the correlation coefficient between pp-NT and HI for the panel of H7 positive was 0.72 (Figure 6). pp-NT assays were undertaken against H5 A/Vietnam/1194/2004 and H7 A/chicken/Italy/13474/1999 pseudotypes. 9/10 sera were confirmed positive when tested by the monoplex assay against H5 A/Vietnam/1194/2004 with titres (expressed as GMT) only one serum sample (n.

HIV envelope glycoprotein was significantly more sensitive to the freeze-thaw procedure than the viruses bearing influenza or rabies virus glycoproteins. pp-NT assays were performed in monoplex and multiplex from both H5 (P = 0.001) and H7 (P = 0.0002) influenza strains. influenza viruses and drift variants faster and more accurately than laborious wild-type virus microneutralization. the major limitations to the use of HI assay are that it is not practical for general influenza A screening with significant level of intralaboratory variability. the authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding publication of this paper. edward et al."}
