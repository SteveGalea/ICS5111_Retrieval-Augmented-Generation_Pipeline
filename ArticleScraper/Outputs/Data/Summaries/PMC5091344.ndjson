{"summary": "the first large multiplex PCR panel for infectious diseases targeted 12 respiratory viruses and was FDA approved in 2009. clinical laboratories may also validate other specimen types such as bronchoalveolar lavage fluid or nasal washes/aspirates to run off-label. multiplex testing may also be cost-effective for children with influenza-like illness evaluated in the emergency department. a recent example of the utility of multiplex testing for epidemiology was the enterovirus D68 outbreak that occurred in the summer of 2014. the use of multiplex molecular panels for the detection of GI pathogens has also been a hot area of commercial product development in recent years. the rapidity of multiplex tests compared to that of conventional methods is one of the major advantages of molecular testing. many of the multiplex Campylobacter DNA detections were true positives given the high specificity of these assays. similar, though less dramatic, trends were seen with other targets across multiple platforms including salmonella, Shigella/enteroinvasive Escherichia coli, and Shiga-like toxin\u2013producing E. coli. clinical implications of coinfection with specific pathogen combinations have not been defined. unexpected organism detections also provide unique opportunities to expand our understanding of rare pathogens and for seasonal outbreaks. conventional microbiologic testing for the evaluation of diarrheal illness has historically been viewed as low cost. the filmArray meningitis/encephalitis panel tests for 14 bacterial, viral, and yeast pathogens using a 200-L sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in about an hour. the panel tests for 14 bacterial, viral, and yeast pathogens using a 200-L sample of cerebrospinal fluid in about an hour. 84.4% positive and >99.9% negative agreement between the ME panel and conventional methods. previous reports observed that the Cryptococcus targets were less sensitive than antigen testing [34], and the ME panel had a limit of detection on the order of 100 colony-forming units/mL. bacterial culture is required to detect organisms not covered by the panel. patients with a very high clinical suspicion for bacterial meningitis or herpes encephalitis should still receive empiric therapy even when the ME panel is negative. multiplexed molecular diagnostics are powerful tools for patient care, epidemiologic studies, and, potentially, infection control. it is highly likely that panel testing will be increasingly used in clinical microbiology in the future. this is highly likely that panel testing will be increasingly used in clinical microbiology in the future. there is a clear understanding of test characteristics, results interpretation, and appropriate utilization. consulttation with the clinical laboratory is also useful to help interpret unexpected or confusing results."}
