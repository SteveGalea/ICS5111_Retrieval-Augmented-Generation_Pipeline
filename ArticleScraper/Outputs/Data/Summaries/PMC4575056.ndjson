{"summary": "Lonicera. macranthoides (L. macranthoides) is a plant distributed widely in south china. it belongs to Caprifoliaceae and is often used in traditional Chinese medicine. the entire plant of L. macranthoides, and particularly the buds and leaves, is used as medicine. a phenylpropanoid generated from the shikimic acid pathway of plant aerobic respiration. PAL, C4H and 4CL are key enzymes involved in the first three steps of CGA biosynthesis. HQT gene may be indispensable in CGA synthesis in L. japonica. genes involved in the biosynthesis of the active ingredients in L. japonica were screened by transcriptome analysis of the flower and leaf tissues using 454 pyrosequencing. there is no transcriptome-wide analysis of L. macranthoides, and molecular mechanisms underlying the biosynthesis of important active components remain a mystery. determination of CGA Content by HPLC Tissue samples was processed in a series of steps, including lyophilization, grinding and passage through a 40 mesh sieve before CGA extraction. the mixture was then centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min. the supernatant was filtered through 0.45 M microfiltration membrane for CGA analysis. cDNAs were end-repaired, A-tailed and ligated with sequencing adaptors. overlapping reads of a certain length were assembled into contigs. the paired-end reads were mapped to contigs, and the different contigs in the same transcript were identified. the best alignment result was used to determine the direction of the unigene sequence. GO classifications for all unigenes were visualized using WEGO software. false discovery rate (FDR) was used to determine the p-value threshold. for GO enrichment analysis, all DEGs were mapped to different terms in the GO database. the number of genes mapped to each term was noted. qPCR detection system using 95\u00b0C incubation for 10 min, then 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s and 60\u00b0C for 60 s. the raw transcriptome reads were deposited in the NCBI Short Read Archive under accession Nos. SRX1003341. no endangered or protected species were involved in this study. HPLC was performed on a Shimadzu LC-20A HPLC analyzer. separation was carried out using a Shimadzu Shim-PackVP-ODS C18 column (5 m, 2504.6 mm) and 2% formic acid (in methanol, 80:20, V/V) as the mobile phase at a 1.0 mL/min flow rate. first, overlapping reads of a certain length were assembled into contigs. then, the paired-end reads were mapped to contigs. the final set of unigenes was obtained using homologous clustering. GO categories were obtained using Blast2GO software. pathway analysis was performed with KEGG database. GO classifications for all unigenes were visualized using WEGO software. all DEGs were mapped to different terms in the GO database (http://www.geneontology.org/), and the number of genes mapped to each term was noted. for pathway enrichment analysis, all DEGs were mapped to the KEGG database, and pathways with Q value 0.05 were considered significantly enriched in DEGs. SRX1003358 (YL) and SRX1003352 (YS) ethics Statement Experiment carried out in the field own by College of Forestry and Life Science. no specific permissions were required for these locations/activities. 66.3% of the unigenes (50,701) were annotated using BLASTx. 50561, 31450, 28077 and 17183 unigenes could be annotated in the Nr database, swissprot database, KEGG database and COG database. 3767 unigenes were mapped to 33 pathways associated with the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. phenylpropanoid biosynthesis is the largest family (447, 11.9%), followed by zeatin biosynthesis (262, 7.0%), flavonoid biosynthesis (249, 6.6%) and stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid and gingerol biosynthesis [Ko00945] (235, 6.2%). biosynthesis 29 Ko00966 Glycosaminoglycan degradation 88 Ko00531 Indole alkaloid biosynthesis 56 Ko00901 Isoflavonoid biosynthesis 60 Ko00943 Isoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis 68 Ko00950 Limonene and pinene degradation 232 Ko00903 Monoterpenoid biosynthesis 30 Ko00902 Nicotinate and pinene degradation 232 Ko00903 Monoterpenoid biosynthesis three libraries including MF, YS and YL were established for RNA-Seq analysis. total reads of MF, YL and YS ranged from 3,550,236 to 3,720,194. only reads aligning entirely inside exonic regions could be matched. 87.10%) Perfect match 2599383(73.22%) 2598665(72.18% 2697153(72.50%) Unique match 2361848(66.53%) 2438931(67.74%) 2495081(67.07%) Multi-position match 710030(20.00%) 683362(18.98% 745375(20.04%) between the MF and YL libraries, there were 3093 up regulated genes and 3738 down regulated genes. between the YS and YS libraries, there were 2848 up regulated genes and 3241 down regulated genes. a total of 691 genes were differentially expressed among the MF, YL and YS libraries. the two different routes of CGA biosynthetic are labeled 1 and 2. each enzyme is annotated with the number of corresponding unigenes shown in parentheses. some of the genes predicted to be involved in CGA synthesis were differentially expressed among YL, YS and MF. compared to YL, except for CL3820.contig2, all 4CL genes were up-regulated in YS. the other six genes showed significantly lower expression in MF than in YL excepted for Unigene13576.

YL and YS of L. macranthoides were measured using HPLC. the CGA content differed significantly between the three tissues (P 0.05), YL (69.7333 0.0378, Mean SE mg/g FW) and MF (37.4027 0.2437). a total of 28,044 unigenes in L. macranthoides were mapped to 128 KEGG pathways. the most represented pathways are metabolic pathways (6514), biosynthesis of secondary metabolites (3194) and plant-pathogen interaction (1633). a total of 80 genes encoding five enzymes involved in CGA biosynthesis were identified by transcriptome analysis in L. macranthoides Hand.-Mazz. this data set is a crucial genetic resource for gene engineering studies on L. macranthoides. inate and nicotinamide metabolism 30 Ko00760 Phenylalanine metabolism 186 ko00360 Phenylpropanoid biosynthesis 447 Ko00940 Porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism 142 Ko00860 Riboflavin metabolism 49 Ko00740 Sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis 235 Ko00945 Steroid biosynthesis 97 Ko00100 Thiamine metabolism 28 Ko00730 Tropane, the total reads of MF, YL and YS ranged from 3,550,236 to 3,720,194. the percentage of clean reads in each library was more than 99.4%. only reads aligning entirely inside exonic regions could be matched. 58(13.47%) 478077(13.28%) 479738(12.90%) DEGs in Different Tissues Gene coverage is the percentage of a gene covered by unique mapping reads. the distribution of each tissue in the reference genome's coverage and sequencing depth are listed in are listed in S1. a total of 691 genes were differentially expressed among the MF, YL and YS libraries. the number of genes involved in CGA synthesis in L. macranthoides was greater than the number in L. japonica. RNA-Seq showed some of the genes predicted to be involved in CGA synthesis were differentially expressed among YL, YS and MF in L. macranthoides. these genes included six PAL, six 4CL, four C4H, one C3H and seven HCT/HQT genes. seven HCT/HQT genes were differentially expressed in different tissues. the other six genes showed significantly lower expression in MF than in YL excepted for Unigene13576. expression of one C3H gene (Unigene23258) was down-regulated in MF compared with YL. contig1 and Unigene13202 share relatively high sequence homology with the HCT sequences in Pyrus bretschneideri and Camellia sinensis. unigene13576, Unigene29578 and Unigene34376 did not show high sequence homology with HCT/HQT genes in other species. qPCR was performed on five candidate genes associated with CGA biosynthesis. qPCR was performed on six genes randomly selected from the expression profile data. results provide reliable transcriptome and expression profile data. we used the Illumina HiSeqTM 2000 platform to investigate gene expression profiles and key pathways for CGA biosynthesis in L. macranthoides. the RNA from MF, YS and YL samples of L. macranthoides was mixed in equal amounts for transcriptome sequencing. 76,453 unigenes were obtained. two possible pathways for CGA biosynthesis and candidate genes related to CGA biosynthesis in L. macranthoides were identified in previous studies. the third pathway, in which caffeoyl glucoside serves as an activated intermediate, has only been reported in sweet potato [49]. phenylpropanoid pathway and other metabolic pathways are not key rate-limiting enzymes in L. macranthoides [23] HQT and HCT are homologous genes involved in the phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway. HQT can use shikimate and quinate as substrates, whereas HQT only uses quinate. peng et al. [26] showed that tissue distribution of HQT was in accordance with the pattern of CGA content, indicating its essential role in CGA biosynthesis. our results strongly support the forward view. -Seq libraries still generated over 3.5 million clean reads in each library. percentage of clean reads among raw tags in each library over 99.4%."}
