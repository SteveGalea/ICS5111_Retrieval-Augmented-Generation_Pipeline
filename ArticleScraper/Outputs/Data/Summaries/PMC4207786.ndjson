{"summary": "classic swine fever virus (CSFV) is a member of the Flaviviradea family. it also contains dengue fever virus, west Nile virus and hepatitis c virus. transmission depends on contact spread, but infected boars could transmit CSFV in semen. integrin 3 mediates extracellular signals by recognizing and delivering different molecules into cells, resulting in changes in calcium, Pyk2 (proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2) and PI-3K (Phosphoinositide 3-kinase) activity [18]\u2013[26]. integrin 3 is a receptor or co-receptor for many viruses, such as Rotavirus [27]\u2013[30], Hantavirus [31]\u2013[33 shRNA-mediated depletion of integrin 3 in EC cells dramatically decreased the rate of CSFV proliferation. results suggest targeted inhibition or depletion of integrin 3 could be a therapeutic treatment for CSFV infection. cells for all assays relating to CSFV infection were cultured to a confluent of 60% in 35 mm cell-culture dishes in MEM containing 10% fetal serum and then incubated with 1.5 ml CSFV liquid (100 CCID50/0.1 ml) at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 for 1 h. a 242-bp DNA was synthesized through reverse transcription from the synthesized 242-bp DNA, and then quantified by the reaction mixture includes: 2 one-step RT-PCR Buffer III, 12.5 l; TaKaRa Ex Taq HS (5 U/l), 0.5 l; Prime Script RT Enzyme Mix II, 0.5 l; PCR forward primer (10 M), 0.5 l; PCR reverse primer (10 M), 0.5 l; total RNA, 2 g; RNase free H2O, added to 20 l. primers of -actin F and -actin R were designed based on the porcine -actin coding sequence (GenBank accession number: AF091507.1) total RNA from different samples was harvested with Trizol reagent and was reversely transcribed to cDNA by using gDNA Eraser (Perfect Real Time) total RNA from the four cell lines with CSFV challenge for 24 h, 48 h or 72 h were harvested and extracted as described before. procedure for the subsequent reverse transcription and two-step qPCR were the same with that mentioned in section 2 of materials and methods. two-step qPCR was performed using primers of 3 qPCR F and 3 qPCR R (Table 1) designed based on the swine integrin 3 coding sequence (GenBank accession number: AF282890.1). Briefly, total RNA from four cell lines with or without CSFV infection were extracted and reversely transcribed to cDNA. integrin 3 function-blocked cell EC cells were incubated with mouse-anti-swine integrin 3 monoclonal antibody for 2 h to functionally block integrin 3 before CSFV challenge. cells were then washed with PBS and infected with CSFV following the protocol. G418 is an aminoglycoside antibiotic used in cell selection. cells with fluorescence were seeded into 24-well plates. at least 5 cell spots per well were picked up and seeded to a new 24-well plate. two-step qPCR was used to determine the deficiency-efficiency on integrin 3 in ICDC or the cells with shRNA transiently transfected. procedure for RNA extraction and reverse transcription as well as the system of two-step qPCR were the same as that mentioned in section 2 of materials and methods. membranes were washed thrice in PBS-T for 10\u201315 min each time. then incubated for 2 h at room temperature with 15,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody of goat-anti-mouse antibody. SYBR Premix Ex Taq II (Perfect Real Time), Prime Script RT reagent kit with gDNA Eraser (Perfect Real Time) and One-step Prime Script RT-PCR kit (Perfect Real Time) were purchased from Takara (Dalian, China) minimum essential medium (MEM) and G418 were products of Gibco (Carlsbad, CA, USA) the standard CSFV RNA was obtained through reverse transcription from the synthesized 242-bp DNA, and then quantified by Nano-Drop (ND-1000) the standard CSFV RNA was diluted in gradient liner ranging from 10\u00b0 to 108. the reaction mixture includes: 2 one-step RT-PCR Buffer III, 12.5 l; TaKaRa Ex Taq HS (5 U/l), 0.5 l; Prime Script RT Enzyme Mix II primers of -actin F and -actin R were designed based on the porcine -actin coding sequence. total RNA from different samples was harvested with Trizol reagent and was reversely transcribed to cDNA by using Prime Script RT reagent kit. two-step qPCR was performed using SYBR Premix Ex Taq II (Perfect Real Time) in Thermal Cycler Dice Real Time System (Takara Bio., Dalian China) with the following procedures: 95\u00b0C (denature) for 3 min followed by 35 cycles of 95\u00b0C (denature) for 10 sec; 60\u00b0C (anneal) for 20 sec and 72\u00b0C (extend) for 20 sec. samples were treated with 0.1% triton X-100 for 10 min at RT. swine serum was added as primary antibody to these prepared samples. secondary antibody of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-swine IgG was then added to the primary-antibody labeled samples. trypsin-digestion adhesion assay was performed to reveal different adhesion abilities of the four cell lines. cell lines were individually cultured to a density of 90% confluence in six-well plates one day before the digestion. cells were then incubated with trypsin solution for 2 min at 37\u00b0C. RNA samples from cells incubated with monoclonal antibody or non-specific IgG for 24 h, 48 h or 72 h p.i. were then extracted and reversely transcribed to cDNAs. two-step qPCR was used to evaluate CSFV proliferation in these antibody-pretreated cells. EC cells with shRNA or nc constructs transfected were cultured in the medium containing 1 mg/ml of G418 for at least 2 weeks. mono-colony cells with fluorescence formed small cell spots. one week later, mono-colony cells with fluorescence formed small cell spots. 11 Western blot Cells from four cell lines and ICDC were harvested and pelleted by centrifugation at 1,000 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. the cells were washed once with PBS, and resuspended in lysis buffer that contained 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) the supernatant samples were loaded and separated by 12% SDS gel. Statistical analysis Data from one-step qRT-PCR and two-step qPCR were collected in triplicate and assessed using 2Ct relative quantitative analysis. differences between means of two groups were calculated using student\u2019s t-test. copy number = (45.665 - CT value)/3.4692. difference between ST group and EC, IEC or PK groups at same time point. Fig. 1B, C, D reveal that CSFV proliferates better in ST cells. CSFV also has the highest amount in cell culture liquid from infected ST cells. this high affinity of CSFV in binding to ST cells may due to high amount of integrin 3 expressed on ST cell membrane. 3 Integrin 3 has the highest amount in ST cells and is up-regulated after CSFV infection. the amount of integrin 3 mRNA in all four cell lines was evaluated using two-step qPCR. integrin 3 mRNA was up regulated in all four cell lines after CSFV infection. ITGB3 denotes integrin 3. *** marked above ST column denotes extremely significant difference between ST and EC, IEC or PK. nc denotes the cell without CSFV infection. results from two-step qPCR, Western blot and trypsin-digestion adhesion assays confirm that ST cells have the highest amount of integrin 3 among all the tested four cell lines. integrin 3 has different expression levels in different cell lines and can be up-regulated post CSFV infection. s denotes relative absorbance value at 570 nm while the absorbance value at 12 h was set as 1. 5 CSFV proliferation rate decreases in integrin 3 function-blocked cell Integrin 3 can be functionally blocked by mouse-anti-swine integrin 3 monoclonal antibody. the amount of CSFV proliferation in cells blocked by mouse-anti-swine integrin 3 monoclonal antibody decreased to half of that observed in non-specific IgG shRNA976, shRNA1110, shRNA1755 were designed to interfere integrin 3 mRNA on specific gene positions. as a control, the nc plasmid generates non-specific small RNAs targeting none of the swine integrin 3 genes. neomycin gene for G418-dependent cell-selection were added to each construct. shRNA1110 and shRNA1755 could decrease integrin 3 mRNA to a moderate level at 48 h post shRNA transfection. nc denotes the negative-control construct which generates non-specific interfere RNA. the expression of integrin 3 decreased to 31% and 20% of that of the negative control group. the efficiency of shRNA in reduction of integrin 3 is significant at both the mRNA and integrin protein levels. one-step qRT-PCR minimized RNA degradation significantly. CSFV had the lowest CT value in cell-culture liquid from infected ST cells at every time point. copy number = (45.665 - CT value)/3.4692. difference between ST group and EC, IEC or PK groups at same time point. *** marked above ST-24 column denotes extremely significant difference. Fig. 1B, C, D reveal that CSFV proliferates better in ST cells. CSFV also has the highest amount in cell culture liquid from infected ST cells. this suggests that CSFV could be secreted into extracellular environment more easily by ST cells than by the other three cells. 3 Integrin 3 has the highest amount in ST cells and is up-regulated after CSFV infection. the amount of integrin 3 mRNA in ST cells was notably higher than that in the other three cell lines. integrin 3 mRNA was up regulated in all four cell lines. ITGB3 denotes integrin 3. *** marked above ST column denotes extremely significant difference between ST and EC, IEC or PK. nc denotes the cell without CSFV infection. results from two-step qPCR, Western blot and trypsin-digestion adhesion assays confirm that ST cells have the highest amount of integrin 3 among all the tested four cell lines. integrin 3 has different expression levels in different cell lines and can be up-regulated post CSFV infection. in integrin 3 function-blocked cell Integrin 3 can be functionally blocked by mouse-anti-swine integrin 3 monoclonal antibody. the amount of CSFV proliferation in cells blocked by mouse-anti-swine integrin 3 antibody decreased to half of that observed in non-specific IgG blocked cells. the decline most obvious at 24 h p.i. shRNA976, shRNA1110, shRNA1755 were designed to interfere integrin 3 mRNA on specific gene positions. as a control, the nc plasmid generates non-specific small RNAs targeting none of the swine integrin 3 genes. nc denotes the negative-control construct which generates non-specific interfere RNA. fluorescence pictures of cells transiently transfected with shRNA976, shRNA1110, shRNA1755 or nc for 48 h. integrin 3 decreased to 31% and 20% of that of the negative control group. the efficiency of shRNA in reduction of integrin 3 is significant at both the mRNA and integrin protein levels. integrin 3 is a cell-surface binding site for many viruses [27], [51]\u2013[58] but little is known about the role of integrin 3 during CSFV infection and proliferation in vitro. integrin 3 plays a critical role in CSFV infection and proliferation. integrin 3 is up-regulated in all four swine cell lines (EC, IEC, PK and ST) during DV infection. integrin 3 is a receptor for foot-and-mouth disease virus [54]\u2013[56], coxackievirus A9 [51], echovirus 9 [52] and rotavirus [27], [61]. integrin is responsible for cell adhesion, so its depletion would lead to loss of adhesion and subsequent apoptosis. the results from our study and Tang, etc. confirm that integrin 3 is up-regulated post CSFV infection. this suggests that integrin 3 is up-regulated post CSFV infection. edward et al."}
