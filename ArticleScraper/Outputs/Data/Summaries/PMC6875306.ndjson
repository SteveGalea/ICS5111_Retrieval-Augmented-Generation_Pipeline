{"summary": "a relationship between HBS/JHS and Clostridium perfringens type A has been established. affected cattle typically present with profound depression, dehydration, melena, and decreased intake decreased milk production, tachycardia, ruminal stasis, abdominal distention, and dark clotted blood in the feces. report highlights successful non-surgical treatment of hemorrhagic bowel syndrome in beef cattle. findings suggest aggressive initial medical therapy may lead to surgery for successful outcomes in cases of HBS in beef cattle. arrhythmias auscultated, and respiratory rate was 40 breaths per minute. bull was negative to withers pinch and bar (grunt) tests for cranial abdominal pain. serum chemistry indicated hypokalemia (3.5; reference range 3.7\u20135.3 mEq/dL), hypochloremia (81; reference range 94\u2013109 mEq/dL), hypocalcemia (7.7; reference range 8.2\u201310.1 mg/dL), metabolic alkalosis with a bicarbonate of 43.0 (reference range 19.5\u201330.3 mEq/dL), hypoalbuminemia (2.4; reference range 3.2\u20133.9 mg/dL), plasma protein 6.9\u20137.7 gm/dL 6.5 \u2014 6.4 \u2014 5.8 \u2014 5.1 5.7 Fibrinogen 100\u2013500 mg/dL 600 \u2014 800 \u2014 600 \u2014 600 400 Sodium 133\u2013147 mEq/L 135 136 139 143 \u2014 139 137 \u2014 Potassium 3.7\u20135.3 mEq/L 3.5 3.0 3.7 4.5 \u2014 4.2 4.8 \u2014 Chloride the second day of hospitalization revealed a specific gravity of 1.014. the bull's attitude and appetite were not improved, and no significant passage of manure was noted. a thoracic ultrasound revealed comet tails in lung tissue. fecal culture was positive for Clostridium perfringens. on fourth day, improvement was seen by presence of a 15 10 cm deposit of loose manure in the stall and resolution of proteinuria. CBC showed an increasing, but still low hematocrit and mildly increased fibrinogen. on the eighth day, IV fluid therapy, penicillin G potassium, flunixin meglumine, and thiamine were discontinued. bull responded well to medical management of intravenous fluid therapy, parenteral antibiotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, lidocaine CRI and pantoprazole. it is debated whether intravenous lidocaine improves intestinal motility by anti-inflammatory or prokinetic effects. the sequence of intoxication in sheep is reported as convulsion, hypotension, respiratory arrest, and finally, circulatory collapse. one previous study reports the use of lidocaine intravenously to cattle with HBS, but in that study all cattle treated medically died [1]. Currently there are no studies evaluating the use of pantoprazole in cattle. multiple drugs in this case report, including pantoprazole, were used in an extralabel fashion. the detection of C. perfringens type A is present in the majority of cases. the 2 toxin is responsible for inflammation of the intestine and partial loss of the mucosa. this is the first report to use penicillin G potassium (22,000 IU/kg IV every 6 hours) for the treatment of HBS. this is the first report to use penicillin G potassium (22,000 IU/kg IV every 6 hours)"}
