{"summary": "HCV replicates its genome in the cytoplasm of the host cell. its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and other nonstructural proteins implicated in genome replication are found in association with rearranged cellular membranes. two viral proteins, NS4B and NS5A, appear to play a major role in induction of membrane rearrangements. f1 activation, it participates in regulation of COPI-dependent vesicular transport, phospholipid metabolism, actin cytoskeleton dynamics at the Golgi membrane, and lipid droplet metabolism. inhibition by BFA or golgicide A (GCA) leads to inhibition of secretion and disassembly of the Golgi complex. GBF1 function in HCV replication is mediated by the pair Arf4 and Arf5. its function in the regulation of the secretory pathway is mediated by the pair Arf1 and Arf4 (33, 34). RESULTS NS3 interacts with GBF1. pGBKT7 plasmids carrying full-length NS3 (Con1 strain) or pGBKT7 alone were cotransformed into yeast strain AH109. transformants were plated onto nonselective medium or onto plates lacking histidine (His) to monitor expression of reporter His3. a hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged version of NS3-4A from the Con1 or JFH-1 strain was coexpressed with a FLAG-tagged version of YFP-GBF1 in HeLa cells. as a control, we used an HA-tagged version of human 1-COP, a COPI subunit previously shown to interact with GBF1 (36). under control conditions, a band of low intensity was observed with NS3 but not 1-COP, localization is altered in cells overexpressing NS3-4A. we made use of U-2 OS cells with inducible expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) (UGFP-9.22) (37), of NS3/4A (UNS3-4A-24) (38), of NS5A (UNS5Acon-6) (39), or of the entire HCV polyprotein (UHCV-11) (40) the expression of NS3 was induced in UNS3-4A-24 and UHCV-11 cells for 24 or 48 h. the cells were lysed and GBF1, NS3, and actin expression was analyzed by immunoblotting. we then analyzed the intracellular localization of GBF1 and NS3 in cells treated with GBF1 inhibitor BFA. structures were observed for both UNS3-4A-24 and UHCV-11 cell lines. the colocalization of NS3 and NS3 was increased in both cells. NS3 interacts with GBF1 in cells treated with BFA or GCA. HeLa cells were cotransfected with pCMV-GLuc and increased amounts of pcDNA3.1-HA-NS3-4A. at 16 h posttransfection, the culture medium was changed and the cells were further incubated for 4 h. promoter stimulator protein 1) contains an NS3 cleavage site. when coexpressed with NS3, a 41-residue C-terminal peptide was removed from the substrate. this proteolytic cleavage was visualized by immunoblotting with an anti-GFP antibody. only very few fluorescent dots were observed in replicon-containing cells. a signal-to-background ratio superior to 10 was calculated after quantification. a significant interaction occurred between NS3 and endogenous GBF1 in cells replicating HCV. mutants were screened by reverse two-hybrid analysis to isolate yeast clones growing on nonselective medium but not on selective medium lacking histidine (His) growth on His medium requires expression of the His3 reporter gene, which only occurs upon interaction of the two protein domains expressed in the yeast two-hybrid system. the pGBKT7-NS3 protease plasmids of these clones were isolated and sequenced. mutated plasmids were reintroduced into yeast cells to confirm their phenotype. all the mutants had a growth defect on selective medium. the localization of the mutated residues in the 3D structure of the protease domain of NS3 was analyzed. in vitro-transcribed replicon RNAs were electroporated into Huh-7.5 cells. genome replication was assessed by measuring luciferase activity over a 96-h time course. kinetics of replication of 4 mutants was very similar to that of the WT replicon. sates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-HA and anti-GFP antibodies. the luciferase activity was measured at 48 h postelectroporation. the replication was inhibited by BFA in a dose-dependent manner. a partial cleavage was observed for mutants L104P, L106S, and I153T. a partial cleavage was observed, suggesting that their protease activity was reduced. a partial cleavage was observed, suggesting that their protease activity was reduced. reduced expression was observed for mutants L104P, L106S, and I153T. MG132 treatment revealed the presence of a band migrating slightly slower than mature NS3 in lysates of cells transfected with inactive or partially active mutants. this result suggests that mutations L82P, C97R, L104P, L106S, G141D, and I153T induced folding defects. the proteolytic cleavage of GFP-IPS in both cell lines was quantified. the results showed a better proteolytic activity for partially active mutants in HeLa cells than in Huh-7 cells. NS3 protease domain mutants are isolated using the yeast reverse two-hybrid screen. a reduction of coimmunoprecipitated NS3 protein was observed with mutant N77D. this result confirmed that the N77D mutation altered the interaction between NS3 and GBF1 in human cells. the residue Ser77 of NS3 is important for JFH1 genome replication. E1E2 JFH-1 containing the indicated mutations was electroporated in Huh-7.5 cells. cells were lysed at the indicated times postelectroporation and luciferase activity was measured. data represent means from 3 independent experiments performed in triplicate. a similar kinetics of infectious virus generation was observed in each experiment. we sequenced the nonstructural protein-coding region of the viral genome. we found a reversion to a Ser residue at position 77 of NS3. S77D coimmunoprecipitation signal was similar to or slightly better than that of the WT. mutated NS3 bound to GBF1 in this assay. an 50% decrease of the signal was observed for S77D. NS3 interacts with the catalytic Sec7 domain of GBF1. pGBKT7 plasmids carrying full-length NS3 were cotransformed into yeast strain AH109 with pGADT7 plasmids carrying full-length NS3 (Con1 strain), the indicated fragments from the con1, H77, and JFH1 strains. the lysate (10 l) and the material bound to beads were analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-GBF1 antibody. deletion mutants were used to further map the interaction within NS3. the interaction between the sec7 domain of GBF1 and the protease domain of NS3 was observed with strains con1, H77, and JFH-1. a lysate was incubated with GST-pro, or GST as a control, coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads. the material bound to the beads was analyzed by immunoblotting using an anti-GBF1 antibody. this result confirmed the capacity of GBF1 to interact with the protease domain of NS3. GBF1 localization is altered in cells expressing HCV NS3-4A. cells were induced for 24 h and processed for immunofluorescence detection of GBF1 (green) and NS3 or NS5A (red) as indicated. white stars indicate cells expressing NS3 and NS3. in uninduced UNS3-4A-24 cells, GBF1 was localized to structures corresponding to the ER-Golgi fused compartment. in BFA-treated cells, a mixed pattern of association with ER-Golgi membranes and with NS3-positive structures was observed. in both cells, the colocalization of GBF1 and NS3 was increased in both cells. as a control, cells were treated with 1 g/ml BFA during this 4-h secretion period. a modest (10%) reduction of GLuc secretion was measured with the highest expression level of NS3. BFA almost completely inhibited GLuc secretion. this results indicated that NS3 has a limited impact on GBF1 function. to quantify NS3 protease activity, we used a GFP-IPS construct (43) as a substrate. enhanced GFP (EGFP) is fused to the C-terminal sequence of MAVS (mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein), which contains an NS3 cleavage site. when coexpressed with NS3, a 41-residue C-terminal peptide was removed from the substrate. this proteolytic cle the two proteins did not appear to be fully colocalized in the same structures. we then performed a proximity ligation assay (PLA) in Huh-7 cells containing a subgenomic replicon using NS3 and GBF1 antibodies. in naive cells, only very few fluorescent dots were observed. a yeast two-hybrid approach was used to isolate NS3 mutants with reduced interaction to GBF1. mutants were screened by reverse two-hybrid analysis to isolate yeast clones growing on nonselective medium but not on selective medium lacking histidine (His) mutants of the NS3 protease domain were grown on nonselective and selective media to monitor reporter expression. mutated residues are shown in red, NS3 active site is shown in pink, NS4A is in yellow, and other NS3 residues are in blue. mutants were reintroduced into yeast cells to confirm their phenotype. asn-77 and Ile-114 are located on different faces of the domain. it is therefore unlikely that they could be part of a single interaction area. in vitro-transcribed replicon RNAs were electroporated into Huh-7.5 cells. NS3-4A or indicated mutants were coexpressed with YFP-GBF1 or YFP-GBF1-FLAG in HeLa cells. cells were lysed and lysates precipitated with anti-FLAG beads. luciferase activity was measured at 48 h postelectroporation. NS3 mutants were coexpressed with GFP-IPS in Huh-7 cells. cleavage efficiency was very similar to that of the WT protease. nonreplicative mutants yielded 3 phenotypes. 5% of lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-HA and anti-GFP antibodies. expression levels of NS3 mutants were also monitored by immunoblotting. expression levels of NS3 mutants were also monitored by immunoblotting. mutants L82P, C97R, G141D, and L143P were inactive for both GFP-IPS cleavage and autoproteolytic processing. mutants V36A, L44Q, N77D, V107A, and I114T appeared as active as the WT construct. asn Ser 20 + + 82 LeuPro Leu Leu 97 CysArg Cys Cys 15 104 LeuPro Leu Leu 106 LeuSer Leu 107 ValAla Val + + + 114 IleThr Ile Ile 4 + + + 141 GlyAsp Gly 143 LeuPro Leu Leu Leu a +, similar to WT; not active, not replicative, or partially active; partially active. we also assessed the protease activity of mutant S77D using the GFP-IPS construct. we observed no difference between WT and S77D cleavage efficiency. these results indicated that the phenotypes of Con1 N77D and JFH-1 S77D mutants are similar. the mutation was inserted into the full-length JFH-1 genome. in vitro-transcribed RNA was introduced into Huh-7 cells by electroporation. after approximately 2 weeks of culture, a few positive cells began to appear. mutations in NS3 of revertant viruses Expt no. Position Mutation 1 77 AspAsn 221 GlnLeu 2 77 AspSer We then assessed the impact of the mutation S77D on the interaction between NS3 and GBF1 by coimmunoprecipitation. this could be explained by slightly higher expression levels of the mutated protein. an alteration in the intracellular localization of GBF1 was observed in inducible NS3-4A-expressing cells and in replicon-containing Huh-7 cells expressing higher levels of NS3. this change in GBF1 intracellular localization is consistent with an alteration in Golgi structure, which has already been reported for HCV-infected cells (53\u201355). GBF1 is not a component of mature HCV replication complexes. inhibition during early times of the replication period strongly inhibits HCV infection. this suggests that GBF1 fulfills an essential function during the onset of genome replication that is not required later during the HCV life cycle. interaction was mapped to protease domain of NS3 and the sec7 domain of GBF1. NS3-4A protease activity might help in genome replication by facilitating the generation of the polyprotein. interaction domains were not mapped to the sec7 domain but to the N-terminal part of GBF1. difference of interacting domains correlate with a difference of function of GBF1 during HCV and enterovirus genome replication. poliovirus replication is not supported by the N-terminal region of GBF1. the future identification of effectors of class II Arfs implicated in viral replication might open the way to defining novel mechanisms of action of GBF1. the future identification of effectors of class II Arfs implicated in viral replication might lead to developing new antiviral therapies.
