{"summary": "the stability of six potential reference genes was examined in eight tissues of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) the relative transcription levels of genes encoding 18S rRNA, S20 ribosomal protein, -actin, glyceraldehyde-3P-dehydrogenase (EF1AA and EF1AB) were quantified in gills, liver, head kidney, spleen, thymus, brain, muscle, and posterior intestine the ideal endogenous control should be expressed at a constant level among different tissues of an organism, at all stages of development and should be unaffected by the experimental treatment. however, data normalization in real-time RT-PCR remains a real problem. a large number of genes have been selected for normalization of mRNA expression data. eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A, formerly elongation factor 1 alpha) plays an important role in translation by catalyzing GTP-dependent binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the acceptor site of the ribosome. in human, cDNAs of two actively transcribed isoforms have been cloned (eEF1A-1 and eEF1A-2) geNorm has been used to select the most stable reference genes in several recent studies (e.g. [4,17,18]). the aim of this work was to evaluate the usefulness of six potential reference genes in the Atlantic salmon. two 'classic' reference genes encoding GAPDH and -actin. two genes encoding 18S rRNA and S20 ribosomal protein. two paralog genes encoding elongation factor 1A (EF1AA and EF1AB) six individuals were analyzed for six potential reference genes in eight tissues of Atlantic salmon. mRNA expression of the selected genes was examined in gills of salmon going through smoltification. the 18S gene had the lowest individual raw Ct variation. most individual raw Ct variation of the studied genes is seen in the presmolt and smolt groups. ribosomal 18S gene emerges as the second worse, whereas paralog EF1A genes became the most stable. qRT-PCR analysis of six genes in gills of six smoltifying salmon. the same data as in Figure 1 but now normalized against an index of the three best genes. for -actin, there was a significant difference between the presmolt and the desmolt groups (n0.01) and between the smolt and desmolt groups (p 0.05). geNorm calculates the gene expression stability measure M for a control gene as the average pairwise variation V for that gene with all other tested control genes. we tend to get PCR efficiencies that are too high in some samples with low A260/230 ratios. after DNase treatment, the A260/280 ratio increased from 1.8 to 2.1. 0.992 -3.27 0.998 S20 -3.28 0.996 -3.21 0.991 -3.29 0.990 -3.07 0.993 -actin -2.73 0.994 -3.36 0.997 -3.11 0.997 -3.05 0.996 -3.13 0.996 EF1AA -3.06 0.996 -3.05 0.993 -3.05 0.994 -3.05 0.994 -3. muscle had the lowest CVs of the studied genes, compared to higher CVs in more active tissues like thymus, intestine, head kidney and spleen. the 18S and S20 genes had the lowest CVs, based on raw Ct values. in all tissues, except intestine, the gene had the highest CV. we did not analyze our data with the bestkeeper software. the bestkeeper tool gave results that slightly deviated from, but nevertheless corresponded to those obtained using geNorm. geNorm ranks the stability of the six genes from 24 fish going through smoltification in order: EF1AB>EF1AA>-actin>S20>18S rRNA>GAPDH. most individual raw Ct variation of the studied genes is seen in the presmolt and smolt groups. qRT-PCR analysis of six genes in gills of six smoltifying salmon. the same data as in Figure 1 but now normalized against an index of the three best genes. for -actin, there were significant differences between the presmolt and the desmolt groups (n0.01) and between the smolt and desmolt groups (p 0.05). geNorm calculates gene expression stability measure M for a control gene as the average pairwise variation V for that gene with all other tested control genes. PCR poisoning We see a correlation between the A260/230 absorbance on the NanoDrop and the PCR efficiency.

PCR was achieved with a 10 min activation and denaturation step at 95\u00b0C, followed by 50 cycles of 15 s at 95\u00b0C and 60 s at 60\u00b0C. the gene expression stability (M) was calculated with the geNorm applet for Microsoft Excel. after smoltification, one group was kept and desmoltified in freshwater. the other group was transferred to seawater (n = 6 in each group) all fish were treated and euthanized according to Norwegian national legislation for laboratory animals. a 260/280 nm absorbance ratio of 1.8 \u2013 2.0 indicates a pure RNA sample. we used the RNeasy MinElute Cleanup kit from Qiagen to purify our most troublesome samples. EF1AA assay was based on a cDNA clone that we reported to the GenBank previously (AF321836). the EF1AB assay was based on the EST BG933853. the chosen primers were used to confirm that the salmon genes contained an intron between the same sites as deduced from the alignment with zebrafish.
