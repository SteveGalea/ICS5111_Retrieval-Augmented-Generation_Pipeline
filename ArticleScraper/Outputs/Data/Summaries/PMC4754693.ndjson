{"summary": "the most distinguishable differences between the active and inactive structures were in the conformational changes of residues Ser139-Phe140-Leu141. in inactive enzymes, this short peptide forms a short 310-helix that twists the oxyanion hole of the S1 subsite. the most distinguishable characteristic of the R298A mutant is the formation of a short 310-helix instead of an active-site loop. we mutated Leu141 to Thr141, a residue with strong -structure and low helix tendency. the triple-mutant G11A/R298A/Q299A (GRQ) was confirmed to be a monomer. tetra-mutant G11A/L141T/R298A/Q299A was a monomer with enzyme activity as designed. we derived kcat and Km of GLRQ using the Lineweaver-Burk plot. kcat was 0.68 0.04 mM and kcat was 0.09 0.001 min1 in the wild-type enzyme20. introducing Thr at position 141 to disrupt the 310-helix can indeed recover proteolysis activity in GLRQ. proteins with low concentrations (0.52 mg/ml for 3CLpro and GRQ, 0.58 mg/ml for GLRQ) are indicated by a solid line. a sedimentation velocity experiment was conducted at 20 \u00b0C in PBS. a single peak was observed for both GRQ and GLRQ at approximately 2.7 s. a previous study has shown upward curvature in the reaction rate versus enzyme concentration plots for 3CLpro23. we measured the enzyme activity of GLRQ at different enzyme concentrations. this result indicates that the enzyme is active as a monomer with no occurrence of substrate-induced dimerization. four simulation systems were constructed (Table 1): the wild type (WT, PDB ID 1UK2), the inactive monomer R298A (Monomer, PDB ID 2QCY), the GLRQ mutant structure built from the active monomer of the wild-type structure (MutantW) we used several criteria to quantify the catalytic machinery of the enzyme, as in previous studies on 3CLpro16,17. in the Monomer system, the distance between His163 and Phe140 is approximately 9. in the first chain of the WT system, the side chains of His163 and Phe140 are well packed. the cosine is close to 1, which means that the rings adopt a face-to-face conformation. the catalytic site collapses due to the formation of a 310-helix at the Ser139-Phe140-Leu141 residues12. in the Monomer system, the 310-helix was well preserved. in WT Chain A, however, all residues had non-helical conformations. the most distinguishable differences between the active and inactive structures were in the conformational changes of residues Ser139-Phe140-Leu141. in inactive enzymes, this short peptide forms a short 310-helix that twists the oxyanion hole of the S1 subsite. this same conformational change is also observed in the collapsed 3CLpro of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV-3CLpro)5. mutated leu141 to Thr141, a residue with strong -structure and low helix tendency. the triple-mutant G11A/R298A/Q299A (GRQ) was confirmed to be a monomer. the tetra-mutant G11A/L141T/R298A/Q299A was a monomer with enzyme activity as designed. kcat is 6.4 2.0 min1 in the wild-type enzyme20. introducing Thr at position 141 to disrupt the 310-helix can indeed recover proteolysis activity in GLRQ. sedimentation velocity experiment was conducted at 20 \u00b0C in PBS with 1 mg/ml concentrations for 3CLpro, GRQ, and GLRQ. a single peak was observed for both GRQ and GLRQ at approximately 2.7 s. two peaks were observed at the monomer and dimer positions. a previous study has shown upward curvature in the reaction rate versus enzyme concentration plots for 3CLpro23. we measured the enzyme activity of GLRQ at different enzyme concentrations. the reaction rate increases proportionally with a positive slope that goes through the origin. the inactive monomer R298A (Monomer, PDB ID 2QCY) and the GLRQ mutant structure built from the active monomer of the wild-type structure (MutantW) used several criteria to quantify the catalytic machinery of the enzyme, as in previous studies on 3CLpro16,17. in the Monomer system, the distance between His163 and Phe140 is approximately 9. in the first chain of the WT system, the side chains of His163 and Phe140 are well packed. the distance is approximately 4 and the cosine is close to 1. the catalytic site collapses due to the formation of a 310-helix at the Ser139-Phe140-Leu141 residues12. To determine whether the L141T mutation disrupts this helix, we compared the backbone dihedrals of these residues. in the Monomer system, the 310-helix was well preserved. the percentages of hydrogen bond formation in the MutantM and MutantW systems were 4.8% and 3.3%, respectively. the Y-X-H motif contains a hydrogen bond between the OH atom of Tyr161 and the ND1 atom of His163. the Y-X-H motif stabilizes the P1 substrate binding site. the distribution in MutantW is between the distributions in WT chains A and B, with two minima at cosine values of 1 and 1 respectively. MutantM system has a local minimum at a distance of 6 and a cosine of 0. This minimum may represent an intermediate state of the inactive-active transition. MutantM system, the helical conformations of S139 and T141 were partially disrupted. a sub-stable helical conformation of residue T141 was observed. these results suggest that the L141T mutation partially disrupts the 310-helix. kcat/Km of GLRQ did not change with changes in enzyme concentration. the short 310-helix formed by Ser139-Leu141 has also been found in the inactive 3C protease (3Cpro) mutant of the hepatitis A virus. the successful design of an active monomer of SARS-3CLpro demonstrates the importance of the ser139-Leu141 loop conformation, as the loop 310-helix transition serves as a switch for enzyme activity. our study shows that the monomer can also be evolved into an active enzyme via mutations. all resulting plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. all resulting plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. one mg/ml 3CLpro, GRQ, or GLRQ was loaded into the centrepieces. absorbance scans were collected at 286 nm with a speed of 56,000 rpm. 5 M GLRQ in 40 mM of phosphate buffer (pH 7.3) were also loaded and analysed at 240 nm. molecular dynamics simulations were conducted with the Gromacs package27. the simple point charge model of water was used to solvate the protein in a periodic dodecahedron box extending 10 from the nearest protein atom. the solvated system then was neutralized with Na+ and Cl ions, minimized by the steepest descent method (5000 steps), and equilibrated with a 100-ps constant volume simulation. mutants were prepared using a colorimetric substrate, Thr-Ser-Ala-Val-Leu-Gln-pNA. substrate (200 M) was mixed with 18 M GRQ, 1.8 M GLRQ, or 1.8 M 3CLpro at 37 \u00b0C to compare their reaction rates. values of Km and kcat were calculated by the Lineweaver-Burk plot. 3CLpro, GRQ, or GLRQ were loaded into the double-sector centrepieces. absorption scans were collected at 286 nm with a speed of 56,000 rpm. 5 M GLRQ in 40 mM of phosphate buffer (pH 7.3) were also loaded and analysed at 240 nm. the production runs were conducted in the constant pressure ensemble (NPT) the temperature was set to 300 K and controlled with a modified Berendsen thermostat29. the pressure was coupled to 1 bar with the Parrinello-Rahman method31."}
