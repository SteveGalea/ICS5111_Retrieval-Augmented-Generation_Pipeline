{"summary": "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have become a global health threat following the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) a new related coronavirus emerged in 2012, and the new respiratory virus has become an endemic problem in the Middle East. MERS-CoV-like viruses have been isolated from masked palm civets, bats, and camels. these are considered some of the many reservoirs of the virus, which sustain transmission in humans and animals. infection in dromedaries can result in either asymptomatic or symptomatic disease. the genome of the virion encodes two polyproteins (pp1ab and pp1b) and nested subgenomic mRNAs. the genome of the virion is contained within the nucleocapsid. it encodes four nonstructural proteins (ns) in ORFs 3, 4a, 4b, and 5, which have vital functions to the virus life cycle. vage sites expose the fusion peptide, stimulating the fusion process inside acidified endosomes. within the endosome, MERS-CoV disassembles, releasing the inner genomic material into the cytoplasm. the replication-transcription complex is formed by further protease cleavage of polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab producing nsp1 and nsp16 template genomic RNA. transmission occurs primarily via dromedary camels, a large source of interaction for Middle Eastern populations. immunocompromised populations have increased susceptibility to MERS-CoV. symptoms may progress to gastrointestinal symptoms, myalgia, shortness of breath, general malaise, abdominal pain, wheezing, palpitations, and confusion. serology tests include Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbant Assay (i.e., ELISA), whole virus indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) testing. many of these isolation and identification methods begin with a viral culture grown from a clinical isolate (i.e., sputum or respiratory samples isolated from the patient) this long wait period makes these current diagnostics laborious and time-consuming, precluding rapid turnaround of results. two immediately noted differences were the incubation period and reservoir transmission. the median incubation period of MERS-CoV infection is 5 days. the average time from onset of symptoms to hospitalization is approximately 4 days. many potential reservoirs are in daily contact with populations in the middle east. many cases of ourocomial MERS-CoV infection and transmission are documented. this is not surprising because of overcrowding and inadequate infection control measures. the primary source of information regarding pathologies associated with MERS-CoV and disease progression comes from medical imaging, which are few and open to interpretation. this gap in information makes current diagnostic trends, infection patterns, and transmission maps only partially complete, making full interpretation difficult for future infectious disease outbreaks. the quick end of the outbreak was partially attributed to efficient quarantine and isolation methods. this included where to seek medical attention and protective measures individuals could take to protect themselves from infection. this included where to seek medical attention and where to seek medical attention. the ity rate of the outbreak has been estimated to range from 36\u201346% between 2012 and 2014. the south Korean outbreak began with a single infected individual, and lasted only 2 months, with the government declaring the outbreak over on July 6 2015. differences in lifestyle of citizens, personal belief systems, and healthcare response to the outbreak are all suspected to have influenced the duration of the outbreak. many people who relied on camels denied correlation between camels and MERS-CoV infections, kicking off the Kiss Your Camel campaign. panic quickly followed the announcement of the outbreak, leading to the dismissal of the Saudi Arabian Health Minister, Abdullah al-Rabeeah [55] isolation practices instilled in hospitals very soon after outbreak. this included mandatory masks, gloves, and gowns for workers and visitors. this helped to regulate, monitor, and standardize the effort to reduce and eventually stop cases within hospitals and the surrounding community. two-thirds of the nearly 2000 participants responded as \"not concerned\" or \"slightly concerned\" about contracting MERS. dromedary camels are the only currently cited animal source of transmission to humans. dromedary camels are the only currently cited animal source of transmission. incubation periods in south Korea were reported as slightly longer, averaging 6 days. this delay also contributes to sustained transmission of MERS-CoV. higher mortality rates in Saudi Arabia compared to south Korea are likely in part due to these differences. south Korean patients who were MERS-positive sought and embraced medical attention much faster than did Saudi Arabian patients. this brings about the previously discussed problem of visiting a variety of healthcare environments prior to diagnosis, exacerbating spread. this brings about the previously discussed problem of visiting a variety of healthcare environments prior to diagnosis. a 2018 study found that many medical professionals working in hospitals with infected patients were unaware of how the disease spreads. only 25% of respondents realized that close contact with an infected patient effectively transmits disease. a problem noted previously among hospitals and clinic settings is visiting multiple doctors before being admitted to hospital [50] dromedary camels are the only currently cited animal source of transmission to humans. a primary reason for sustained transmission of MERS-CoV is the constant presence and interaction with dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia. dromedary camels are the only currently cited animal source of transmission to humans. the first was the open relationship between healthcare professionals and patients seen in south Korea. patients felt more comfortable with their healthcare workers, and were more willing to go to the hospital or clinic if they felt unwell. there was more stringent training for healthcare professionals in south Korea. the future of MERS outbreak prevention is in the hands of government policy makers, hospital workers, and a well-informed general population. better infection control practices, improved communication of protection knowledge to the general public are the primary ways to improve outbreak outcomes."}
