{"summary": "as of 3 February 2015, there have been 965 confirmed cases and 357 deaths. for SARS-CoV, the virus emerged from a reservoir in bats, replicated in an intermediate host (civet cats) and spread to humans. coronaviruses are RNA viruses that encode a replicase polyprotein at the 5\u2032 end of the positive-strand genome. Upon virus entry, the genomic RNA is translated to produce replicase polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab), which are processed by virally encoded proteases. the pp1a encodes one or two papain-like proteases (PLPs) and one 3C-like proteinase (3CLpro or Mpro the catalytic activity of PLP1 is required for efficient virus replication (23). the LXGG recognition site is similar to the RLRGG recognition site of cellular deubiquitinating enzymes. further studies revealed that coV PLPs could be multifunctional enzymes with both protease and deubiquitinating activity (25). MHV-A59 Ubl-2 domain influences papain-like protease activity. the role of the Ubl domain in modulating the enzyme activity of MHV PLP2 is unknown. hek293T cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2% l-glutamine. hek293T cells were cultured in minimal essential medium (MEM) with 10% FBS, 2% l-glutamine, and 10% tryptose phosphate broth (TPB) the Flag-Ub plasmid was provided by Ralph Baric (University of North Carolina) the Flag-Ub plasmid was provided by Ralph Baric (Loyola University Chicago). HEK293T cells were transfected with 250 ng nsp2/3-GFP plasmid and 300 ng pCAGGS-PLP2-V5 expression plasmids. at 24 h posttransfection, cells were lysed with 300 l of lysis buffer A containing 4% SDS and 3% dithiothreitol (DTT) membrane was washed 3 times for 15 min in TBST buffer, followed by incubation with secondary donkey-anti-rabbit-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) antibody. membrane then washed 3 times for 15 min in TBST buffer. plasmid encoding the MHV B subclone was mutagenized using primers described in Table 1. RNA was electroporated into BHK-R cells, and the electroporated cells were seeded onto DBT cells. the supernatant was harvested 36 h postelectroporation, and plaque assay was performed as described previously. the sequence was cloned from pCAGGS-MCS-PLP2 into ligation-independent cloning vector pEV-L8, which is a modified pET-30 plasmid. wild-type PLP2 was induced at 25\u00b0C for 6 h, while the V787S mutant was induced at 18\u00b0C overnight. the protein was eluted through a gradient of 5% to 100% buffer B in 30 column volumes (CV) the protein was eluted through a gradient of 5% to 100% buffer B in 30 column volumes. at each time point, the specific activity of both enzymes was measured at 25\u00b0C using a Synergy multimode microplate reader. the assay buffer used contained 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 2 mM DTT. similar experiments were carried out when the enzymes were incubated at 30\u00b0C. mice were anesthetized with ketamine-xylazine prior to intracranial injection with 600 PFU of wild-type icMHV A59 or AM2 mutant. mice were sacrificed when they lost 25% of their initial body weight. mice infected with wild-type icMHV or AM2 were harvested and homogenized at days 3 and 5 postinfection. RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini (Qiagen) one l of cDNA was used to set up quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. codon-optimized synthetic PLP2 sequence was cloned into pCAGGS-MCS vector. overlapping PCR strategy was used with the primers described in Table 1. HEK293T cells in 12-well CellBIND plates were transfected with 25 ng nsp2/3-GFP plasmid and 300 ng pCAGGS-PLP2-V5 expression plasmids. the cells were transfected with 600 ng Flag-Ub plasmid and pCAGGS-PLP2-V5 expression plasmids. cells were lysed with 300 l of lysis buffer A containing 4% SDS and 3% dithiothreitol (DTT) at 24 h posttransfection, cells were lysed with 300 l of lysis buffer A. proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. membrane was blocked using 5% dried skim milk in TBST buffer. mouse anti-calnexin antibody at a dilution of 1:2,000 was used as a loading standard. hek293T cells were transfected with 37.5 ng pGlo-RLKGG construct and 50 ng of PLP2 expression plasmids. PCR was performed using replicase primers (Table 1). AM2 and AM3 were plaque purified, and AM2 was subjected to deep sequencing. at 2, 4, or 6 h postinfection, cells were moved to 39.5\u00b0C. the supernatant was resuspended in 40 ml buffer A (25 mM Tris, pH 7.0, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, 5 mM ME) the supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-m membrane (Millipore) and loaded onto a 5-ml Ni HiTrap HP column (GE Health Care) preequilibrated with buffer A. ex-75 HiLoad 26/60 column (GE Healthcare) preequilibrated with buffer D (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM dithiothreitol [DTT]) eluted at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. wild-type and V787S purified protein incubated at 25\u00b0C for different time periods. thermal melting analyses of wild-type and V787S mutant MHV PLP2 were carried out with a Chirascan circular dichroism (CD) spectrometer by monitoring the CD signal at 220 nm while increasing the temperature at a step interval of 0.4\u00b0C and at a rate 0.5\u00b0C/min. mice were anesthetized with ketamine-xylazine prior to intracranial injection with 600 PFU of wild-type icMHV-A59 or AM2 mutant. survival and weight loss were monitored daily. mice were sacrificed when they lost 25% of their initial body weight. the engineered AM2 strain was subjected to deep sequencing. the sequence was deposited in GenBank under accession number KP887098. to identify domains and residues within nsp3 that modulate protease activity, we generated a synthetic codon-optimized parent construct. V785S, and V787S showed the highest defect in protease activity, while D786K showed an intermediate phenotype. these results implicated the Ubl-2 domain as a modulator of viral protease activity in MHV. we determined the deubiquitinating (DUB) activity of the mutants. iter and pinpoint plaques generated by AM1 likely are due to the quadruple mutation in PLP2. however, we cannot rule out the possibility that additional mutations outside PLP2 contribute to this phenotype. we infected DBT cells with isogenic wild-type MHV-A59 or AM2 virus at an MOI of 0.1. the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C, supernatant was harvested, and virus titer was determined by plaque assay. at 37\u00b0C, AM2 replicated with kinetics similar to those of wild-type virus. DBT cells were infected at an MOI of 0.1 at 37\u00b0C with AM2 or the WT. at the indicated time point postinfection, cells were moved to 39.5\u00b0C until 14 hpi. the error bars represent standard deviation within single experiments. wild-type and PLP2-V787S mutant PLP2 enzymes were expressed and purified from E. coli. temperature-dependent inactivation of wild-type and PLP2-V787S mutant PLP2 enzymes was measured after incubation at 25\u00b0C and 30\u00b0C for different time periods. thermal denaturation experiments using circular dichroism (CD) analysis to determine the melting temperatures (Tm) of each enzyme. the determined melting temperature was 6.8\u00b0C lower for the V787S mutant protein than for wild-type PLP2. the mutant PLP2 is less stable and unfolds at a lower temperature than wild-type PLP2. RNA levels for viral replicase gene and cellular IL-6 were determined using qRT-PCR in livers at day 5 postinfection (n = 6). RNA levels were normalized to actin, and the amount of transcript in WT-infected mice was set to 1. Error bars represent standard errors of the means (SEM). AM2-immunized and age-matched naive mice infected with 6,000 PFU of wild-type virus at 9 weeks after primary infection. naive mice lost significantly more weight than 4-week-old mice, so as expected, no wild-type- or AM2-infected mice succumbed to the infection. we found that substitution of specific residues within the ubiquitin-like domain 2 adjacent to PLP2 consistently affected protease activity. we found that, consistent with transcleavage assay results, all Ubl-2 mutants had decreased protease activity. however, VDVL/SSSS, V785S, and V787S showed the highest defect in protease activity. the presence of the mutations was confirmed by sequencing within the PLP2 domain. MHV-AM1 was highly impaired, generated pinpoint-sized plaques, and grew to low titer (1 103 PFU/ml) the presence of the mutations was confirmed by sequencing within the PLP2 domain. AM2 produced small plaques at 39.5\u00b0C (about 50% reduction compared to the level for the wild type) but was unable to generate plaques at 40.5\u00b0C. AM3 also produced plaques that were slightly smaller than those of the wild type but bigger than AM2 plaques at 39.5\u00b0C (about 20% reduction compared to the wild type) nsp3-V787S substitution impairs PLP2 thermal stability. nsp3-V787S substitution impairs PLP2 thermal stability. nsp3-V787S substitution impairs PLP2 thermal stability. wild-type and V787S mutant PLP2s were incubated at 25\u00b0C. the specific activity of the enzymes decreased rapidly over time. the wild-type protein maintained full activity (Fig. 4B) mutant at 30\u00b0C is 0.025 0.001 min1, and half-life (t1/2) is 27.7 1.1 min. (C) CD melting curves of WT and PLP2-V787S mutant PLP2 was determined by measuring the CD signal at 220 nm as a function of temperature at a step interval of 0.4\u00b0C and at a rate of 0.5\u00b0C/min. mutation in AM2 was maintained upon mouse infection by sequencing within the PLP2 domain of recovered AM2. MHV AM2 is attenuated and generated protective immunity in mice. titers in brains of mice infected with 600 PFU WT icMHV or AM2 mutant were determined at the indicated time points p.i. by plaque assay. levels of viral replicase and IL-6 were reduced in the livers of AM2-infected mice at day 5 postinfection compared to those of wild-type MHV-infected mice. there was no difference in CCL2 or alpha interferon (IFN-) also, we analyzed livers for changes in pathology and observed a reduction in the size of the lesions, hepatocyte necrosis, and inflammation in AM2-infected mice. ubiquitin-like domain (Ubl) is highly conserved in coronaviruses. mutation of the ubiquitin-like domain destabilizes the adjacent protease domain. mutant virus replicates efficiently in cell culture at 37\u00b0C. the Ubl domain of USP14 is required for targeting this cellular DUB to the proteasome. at the proteasome, USP14 removes ubiquitin molecules from proteins modified with K48-linked ubiquitin. Alternatively, the Ubl may regulate function of DUB activity by interacting with other cellular proteins, such as GMP synthetase. the destabilization of the PLP2 catalytic domain has an important impact on virus pathogenesis. a superposition of the Ubl-2 domains from MHV PLP2 (blue) and SARS-CoV PLpro (orange; PDB code 2FE8) is shown as a stereo view. the most dramatic reduction in AM2 viral titer in the mice was in the liver, not the brain. the arterivirus equine arteritis virus (EAV) PLP DUB activity has been shown to be involved in inhibition of innate immune response in transfected cells. further studies are needed to determine the role of DUB activity in viral replication and pathogenesis in vivo. nsp16 activity required to evade viral mRNA detection by pattern recognition receptor MDA5. deletion or introduction of inactivating mutation in ns2 in MHV results in activation of the RNase L pathway."}
