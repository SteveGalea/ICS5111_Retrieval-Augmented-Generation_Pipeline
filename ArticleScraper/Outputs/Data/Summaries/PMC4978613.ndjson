During human RSV infection, the incubation period is 5 days (range, 3 to 8 days) (42) 5% between HBV genotypes and 2.8% within HBV genotypes (46) as a blood-borne virus, HBV can be transmitted by sexual contact, needle sharing, blood transfusions, or maternal transmissions. the incubation period of HBV infections is 90 days (range, 60 to 150 days) papillomaviruses have been widely found in birds, reptiles, marsupials, and mammals. cross-transfer between species is rare. worldwide prevalence of HPV in women without cervical abnormalities is 11% to 12%. HCMV infections are associated with high morbidity and mortality rates in solid-organ transplant and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. prevalence of congenital HCMV at birth is estimated to be 0.64% (range, 0.60 to 0.69%). in 2012, 140 million and 417 million people between 15 and 49 years of age lived with HSV-1 and HSV-2. a VZV particle, which is 150 to 200 nm in diameter (77), contains a linear double-stranded DNA genome carrying 73 genes (78) the nine human viruses have caused devastating infectious diseases. a high level of genetic variation has been observed in the HIV genome. a high level of genetic variation has been observed in the HIV genome. patients can become infected with HIV by sexual contact, needle sharing, blood transfusions, or maternal transmissions. many clinical complications have been reported: lymphoma, psychiatric disorders, gingivitis, cardiovascular disease, lung cancer, kidney disease, osteoporosis, papulosquamous disorders. influenza viruses from the Orthomyxoviridae family caused the first recognizable influenza pandemic in the summer of 1510 (29, 30), and they were isolated for the first time in 1933. influenza viruses are divided into strains but not subtypes. influenza viruses have been discovered in a broad spectrum of animal reservoirs (36). the typical incubation period is 1 to 4 days (average, 2 days) influenza viruses cause 250,000 to 500,000 deaths every year. 3 million to 5 million cases of severe illnesses reported in 2014. an HBV particle, which is 42 to 46 nm in diameter (45), contains a circular double-stranded DNA genome encoding 6 viral proteins. it has been estimated that the nucleotide diversity of HBV genomes is 14.5% between HBV genotypes and 2.8% within HBV genotypes (46). HPV strains can be classified into >200 types based on the sequence variation of a late region encoding the capsid protein L1 (54). high-risk HPV type 16 (HPV-16) and HPV-18 are known to cause 70% of cervical cancers. low-risk HPV-6 and HPV-11 cause 90% of external genital warts (56) and most cases of respiratory papillomatosis (57) HCMV infections are associated with high morbidity and mortality rates in solid-organ transplant and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. HCMV infections are associated with high morbidity and mortality rates in solid-organ transplant recipients. genital herpes infections cause pain during urination and blistering sores. incubation period of HSV-1 or HSV-2 is 4 days (range, 2 to 12 days) (75) 30% of humans have been infected with herpes zoster over their lifetime (83), and the seroprevalence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody to varicella-zoster virus is >86% in children and adults (84). in the united states, VZV infections give rise to 1 million cases or more each year (83, 85) idoxuridine and trifluridine are now used for topical treatment of HSV keratitis. they must be phosphorylated by cellular kinases to either the 5\u2032-triphosphate (TP) form (i.e., idoxuridine) or the 5\u2032-monophosphate form (i.e., trifluridine), both of which actively inhibit viral and cellular DNA synthesis. triphosphate of brivudine targets the viral DNA polymerase for the inhibition of viral DNA synthesis. dsDNA and foscarnet inhibit DNA synthesis at the active site of HCMV DNA polymerase. dsDNA is placed in the center, where foscarnet inhibits DNA synthesis. BVDU has been approved in many countries all over the world. brivudine is used as eye drops for the treatment of HSV-1 epithelial keratitis. treatment with brivudine at 14 days was at least as effective as acyclovir and ganciclovir, two acyclic guanosine analogues. vidarabine was the first of the FDA-approved nucleoside analogues to be administered systemically in clinics. since June 2001, vidarabine has been discontinued in the united states. for the treatment of HBV infections, the following compounds have been licensed. telbivudine is superior to lamivudine in terms of higher rates of undetectable viremia and less resistance (111). telbivudine, lamivudine, and adefovir dipivoxil are not recommended because they have a low barrier to resistance (114). trisodium phosphonoformate, known as foscarnet, was discovered as a new antiviral compound in 1978 (116) the novelty of foscarnet depends on the fact that these compounds are unlike other classical antiviral agents (i.e., BVDU and acyclovir), because they do not have to be phosphorylated (i.e., metabolized to their active metabolite) before their binding to drug targets (i.e., viral DNA foscarnet is used exclusively in the treatment of HCMVs or HSVs that have become resistant to the classical nucleoside analogues such as acyclovir. foscarnet-based regimens may eradicate viremia rapidly. common side effects with foscarnet are nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, headache, renal impairment, or ionized hypocalcemia. the group of NRTIs were approved to treat HIV or HBV infections. dsDNA and zidovudine triphosphate targets the drug-binding pocket. nevirapine targets the drug-binding pocket to inhibit the activity of HIV-1 RT during DNA synthesis. all NRTI compounds are known as 2\u2032,3\u2032-dideoxynucleoside analogues. after their phosphorylation to the 5\u2032-TP, NRTIs act as chain terminators. all NRTI compounds are known as 2\u2032,3\u2032-dideoxynucleoside analogues. NRTIs are commonly administered with other drugs in highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) to target multiple stages of the HIV life cycle (139, 140) both lamivudine and emtricitabine are backbones in 9 approved combination drugs. the most common side effects with NRTIs are reversible peripheral neuropathy, nausea, headache, rash, anemia, leukopenia, pancreatitis, gout, or hypersensitivity. the FDA-approved agent zalcitabine has been discontinued since December 2006. patent expiration thus stimulates broad marketing worldwide, making NRTIs popular first-line agents against HIV infections in resource-limited areas. etravirine (Intelence) and rilpivirine (Edurant) are now on the market. Delavirdine is currently rarely used due to its high toxicity, relatively low potency, and complex drug interactions (155) unlike NRTIs, NNRTIs do not need any metabolic processing to inhibit HIV reverse transcription. the most common side effects with NNRTIs are rash, central nervous system toxicity, or elevation of liver enzyme levels (143). the most common side effects with NNRTIs are rash, central nervous system toxicity, or elevation of liver enzyme levels (143). s compete with natural substrates of HIV protease as the peptidomimetic scaffold (169), amino acid variations near this scaffold and within the cleavage sites of protease substrates. other protease inhibitors are still widely used for HIV infections. common side effects with PIs are nephrolithiasis, hypertension, rash, diarrhea, elevation of liver enzyme levels, ingrown toenails, benign hyperbilirubinemia, and different PI-based treatments have been recommended for HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections to take resistance-associated mutation patterns into account. current U.S. and European treatment guidelines recommend the use of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r), saquinavir/ritonavir (SQV/r), or darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r) for patients infected with HIV-2. cobicistat has been approved as asunaprevir, boceprevir, paritaprevir, simeprevir, telaprevir, vaniprevir, and grazoprevir were discontinued for commercial reasons. combination drugs of asunaprevir plus daclatasvir and vaniprevir plus pegylated interferon alfa 2b (PegIFN-2b) plus ribavirin have been approved in Japan. paritaprevir is now used in combination with ombitasvir plus ritonavir (Viekira Pak) or ombitasvir plus dasabuvir plus ritonavir (Technivie) to treat HCV genotype 1 or 4 infections, respectively. many experimental NS3/4A protease inhibitors have been (or still are) under clinical development. hydroxyethylene bond acts as the peptidomimetic scaffold, including saquinavir, ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir, lopinavir, atazanavir, fosamprenavir, and darunavir. the only exception is tipranavir, which is built on the coumarin scaffold (168) cobicistat is a pharmacoenhancer used with HIV protease inhibitors. but cobicistat alone shows no antiviral activity. cobicistat inhibits intestinal transport proteins. cobicistat is now coadministered with the PIs darunavir (Prezcobix) and atazanavir (Evotaz) as well as other anti-HIV drugs (Stribild and Genvoya), which are elucidated below. despite fundamental differences in their structures and modes of replication, HIV and HCV share some similarities. boceprevir, telaprevir, asunaprevir, simeprevir, paritaprevir, vaniprevir, and grazoprevir in the group of HCV protease inhibitors. all approved NS3/4A protease inhibitors are used for treatment of infection by HCV genotype 1, the most prevalent genotype in HCV-infected populations (182). viral integrases insert proviral DNA into host genomes through multistep process. diketo acids (i.e., L-870812) could actively suppress replication of simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) in rhesus macaques (185). raltegravir was added to an optimized background regimen (186), offering better virus suppression than the OBR alone (187). raltegravir, elvitegravir, and dolutegravir in the group of HIV integrase inhibitors. elvitegravir effectively inhibited the DNA strand transfer reaction of HIV-1 integrase (190) elvitegravir can be used in combination with nucleos(t)ide analogues. elvitegravir requires only once-daily dosing, compared with twice-daily dosing for raltegravir (196) elvitegravir is usually well tolerated, while the most common side effects are diarrhea and nausea (197) dolutegravir is the third integrase inhibitor on the market. integrase inhibitors are superior to NRTIs, NNRTIs, and protease inhibitors (200) the most common side effects with integrase inhibitors are nausea, diarrhea, hepatitis, or hypersensitivity (200) integrase inhibitors are under investigation in clinical trials. the use of raltegravir was effective, particularly for the treatment of HIV-infected patients with high HIV-1 RNA levels, low CD4 cell counts, and low genotypic or phenotypic sensitivity scores. there is no raltegravir-based combination approved by the FDA, the effectiveness of such combination drugs has yet to be elucidated. elvitegravir inhibited strains of various HIV-1 subtypes. elvitegravir can be used in combination with nucleos(t)ide analogues. elvitegravir was approved as the first once-daily four-drug pill in 2012. dolutegravir and raltegravir share similar efficacies and safety profiles. once-daily dolutegravir provides a better virologic response than twice-daily raltegravir in antiretroviral-experienced patients (201) integrase inhibitors are superior to NRTIs, NNRTIs, and protease inhibitors (200). the potent anti-HIV activity of therapy with cabotegravir plus rilpivirine was shown in a randomized, phase 2b, dose-ranging trial (207), but more evidence is still required to support its clinical use. integrase inhibitors have offered good tolerability, a favorable safety profile, and an absence of significant drug interactions (200) only anti-HIV drug that must be injected subcutaneously twice daily. enfuvirtide has high drug efficacy with minimal systemic toxicity. long-term application is limited due to subcutaneous administration. maraviroc is the first FDA-approved chemokine receptor antagonist or CCR5 inhibitor that targets the chemokine receptor CCR5 on the surface of CD4+ cells and macrophages. despite its poor oral bioavailability, the principle of attacking CCR5 was proved to be a success when maraviroc showed promising antiviral activities in cell lines (220) and clinical trials (221, 222) zumab and RSV-IGIV are sterile human immunoglobulin produced from adult plasma with high titers of neutralizing antibodies to RSV (227) these neutralizing antibodies can prevent RSV surface glycoproteins F and G from anchoring to host cells (227) palivizumab (Synagis) marked the discontinuation of RespiGam in 2004 (231) VariZIG is a detergent-treated, sterile, lyophilized preparation of IgG purified from human plasma harboring high levels of anti-VZV antibodies. it is administered intramuscularly to high-risk patients who lack evidence of immunity to VZV and are ineligible for VZV vaccination. enfuvirtide and maraviroc Enfuvirtide (also known as T20) are a polypeptide homologous to the heptad repeat region of HIV-1 GP41 (208) enfuvirtide mimics the helix in heptad repeat 2 (HR-2) to prevent the interaction between HR-1 and HR-2 (209, 210) enfuvirtide is still the only anti-HIV drug that must be injected sub chemical formula of enfuvirtide and tertiary structure of the HIV-1 GP41 trimer (PDB accession number 2X7R) tertiary structure of the prefusion RSV glycoprotein F trimer in complex with the antibody motavizumab (PDB accession number 4ZYP) aplaviroc, vicriviroc and vicriviroc were two antagonists. maraviroc showed promising antiviral activities in cell lines and clinical trials (221, 222) maraviroc does not inhibit R4 viruses, and half of patients infected with R4 viruses fail maraviroc-based treatments (214, 215) palivizumab prophylaxis is recommended only for preterm infants with chronic lung diseases or congenital heart diseases. despite promising outcomes from clinical trials, systematic reviews suggest that the limited clinical and social benefits are insufficient to justify the high cost of palivizumab prophylaxis. docosanol docosanol is a 22-carbon, saturated, primary alcohol that inhibits a broad spectrum of lipid-enveloped viruses (e.g., HSV, RSV, HCMV, and VZV) based on in vitro experiments (241, 242) clinical evidence suggests that 10% docosanol topical cream is safe and effective to reduce the healing time and duration of symptoms. acyclovir was originally designed as an inhibitor of adenosine deaminases to enhance the antiviral activity of vidarabine. acyclovir owed its selectivity against HSV to specific phosphorylation by viral thymidine kinases. a few months later, acyclovir showed potent activity against herpesviruses (248) acyclovir, famciclovir, valacyclovir, ganciclovir, penciclovir, and valganciclovir can be phosphorylated by HSV thymidine kinase and cellular enzymes. acyclovir continues to be the gold standard for the treatment of HSV infection. the mortality rate of patients with herpes simplex encephalitis who received acyclovir is 14 to 19% (253). valacyclovir has superseded acyclovir for the treatment of HSV or VZV infections (254). famciclovir offers significant benefits, such as cost-effective therapy and accelerated rates of lesion resolution. in 1986, (S)-HPMPA was first reported as a new broad-spectrum anti-DNA virus agent by De Clercq et al. (258) it could be considered the prototype ANP, from which emanated a series of ANP analogues. cidofovir was approved for the treatment of HCMV retinitis in AIDS patients. monotherapy is comparable to therapy with TDF plus ()FTC (263, 267) or TDF plus ETV (268, 269) because of its potency and high barrier to resistance, TDF monotherapy is currently recommended as the first-line treatment against chronic hepatitis B. the optimal combination drug achieves a sustained loss of serum hepatitis B virus surface antigen has yet to be discovered. ofovir (now generic), (ii) adefovir dipivoxil (Hepsera), (iii) TDF (Viread), (iv) TDF and ()FTC in combination with efavirenz (Atripla), (vi) TDF and ()FTC in combination with elvitegravir and cobicistat (Stribild) phase 3 clinical trials suggest >90% of treatment-naive HIV-infected this combination drug could achieve virological success in 1,732 (94.9%) of 1,825 patients at 48 weeks of treatment (275, 277). this is because HIV-infected patients show fewer renal and bone effects after receiving Genvoya (275, 277) two units of the HCV NS5A dimer are shown in pink and orange. velpatasvir is an experimental inhibitor currently in phase 3 clinical trials. beclabuvir is a forthcoming inhibitor in the combination drug of daclatasvir plus asunaprevir plus beclabuvir. daclatasvir can specifically bind to the HCV nonstructural protein NS5A (282) NS5A inhibitors can block HCV RNA replication by interrupting the formation of the membranous web. NS5A inhibitors can block HCV RNA replication by interrupting the formation of the membranous web. treatment with daclatasvir (60 mg, once daily) plus asunaprevir (100 mg, twice daily) reached a high rate of SVR12 of up to 86.4% (n = 864) phase 4 trial is currently underway to investigate safety and efficacy of daclatasvir plus asunaprevir in patients with chronic hepatitis C infection and chronic renal failure. the combination of grazoprevir (100 mg) plus elbasvir (50 mg) showed a success rate of SVR12 of up to 95.8% (n = 464) the combination of grazoprevir (100 mg) plus elbasvir (50 mg) has been shown to be an effective pangenotypic drug (Zepatier) against HCV genotype 1 or 4 infection. the combination has been dubbed Harvoni, which is administered as a once-daily oral pill containing sofosbuvir (400 mg) and ledipasvir (90 mg) the treatment duration could eventually be shortened to 12 weeks (293), providing high rates of sustained virologic response in patients coinfected with HIV-1 and HCV genotype 1 or 4. phase 3 HALLMARK-DUAL trial enrolled patients with HCV genotype 1b infection, including 307 treatment-naive patients; 205 nonresponders; and 235 ineligible, intolerant, or ineligible and intolerant patients (285). phase 3 trial enrolled 135 interferon-ineligible/intolerant patients and 87 nonresponder patients showed high SVR12 rates. svir plus asunaprevir was approved by the FDA to treat HCV genotype 1 or 4 infection. elbasvir and grazoprevir inhibit HCV nonstructural protein NS5A and NS3/4A protease. grazoprevir (100 mg) plus elbasvir (50 mg) showed a success rate of SVR12 of up to 95.8% (n = 464) the combination of grazoprevir (100 mg) plus elbasvir (50 mg) has been shown to be an effective pangenotypic drug (Zepatier) against HCV genotype 1 or 4 infection. a real \u201ccure\u201d of a chronic virus infection is unheard of in the medical history of infectious diseases. current development of anti-HIV drugs requires lifelong treatments, while anti-HBV therapies may lead to a real cure only in a small percentage of HBV-infected patients. RNA polymerase of influenza virus is a tetramer (480) but the complete tetramer structure of the RNA polymerase in complex with its inhibitors is still lacking. amantadine and rimantadine Amantadine were the first antiviral compound approved in 1966 to treat influenza A virus infections (297) this compound blocks the transport of H+ ions through the M2 protein channels, thus preventing the uncoating of influenza virus particles within the end amantadine and rimantadine do not contribute to the prevention, treatment, or reduced duration of influenza A virus infection in children and the elderly. there is growing interest for the use of amantadine in the early symptomatic treatment of Parkinson disease and levodopa-induced dyskinesia. intravenous peramivir and inhalational laninamivir are used as a single-dose treatments for influenza A and B viruses. but this application is limited in a few countries (laninamivir in Japan and peramivir in the united states, Japan, South Korea, and China) it is the first synthetic nucleoside analogue that has ever been reported against a broad spectrum of RNA viruses. ribavirin in the triphosphate form effectively inhibits the RNA polymerase of influenza virus (322) ribavirin is used in the therapy of some hemorrhagic fever virus infections (e.g., Lassa fever [323]) but ribavirin has never been licensed for this medication. favipiravir effectively inhibits Ebola virus infections in mouse models (335, 336) but further investigations are still needed. favipiravir can inhibit the replication of human norovirus (325, 326) and human arenaviruses (338, 339), but these new applications require further evidence from clinical trials. amantadine was the first antiviral compound approved in 1966 to treat influenza A virus infections (297) zanamivir is a highly selective inhibitor of influenza A and B virus neuraminidases. zanamivir prevents influenza infections by impeding virus release. zanamivir administered by inhalation was soon joined by oseltamivir. two neuraminidase inhibitors were later launched for the treatment of influenza infections. ribavirin inhibits inosine-5\u2032-monophosphate (IMP) dehydrogenase. inhibits inosine-5\u2032-monophosphate (IMP) dehydrogenase. ribavirin is used in the therapy of some hemorrhagic fever virus infections. ribavirin has never been formally licensed for this medication. avipiravir (also known as T-705) has been pursued for the treatment of influenza infections (329\u2013331) favipiravir is converted intracellularly to its ribofuranosyl monophosphate form by the phosphoribosyl transferase. two phosphorylations convert the ribofuranosyl monophosphate form to the triphosphate form, the active metabolite of favipiravir. interferon alfacon 1, pegylated interferon alfa 2a (PegIFN-2a) and pegIFN-2b (Table 2). these approved drugs share one thing in common: they exert specific inhibitory effects without targeting viral proteins directly. interferon alfacon 1 has been discontinued since September 2013. pegIFN-2a and PegIFN-2b mainly interfere with viral replication in two aspects. they stimulate immunity cells (CD8+ cells and natural killer T cells) to enhance the noncytolytic clearance of viruses by cytokines or cytolysis of infected cells. second, they stimulate the expression of innate antiviral genes and proteins to block viral replication. ferons should or should not be combined with other antiviral compounds (e.g., lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil, TDF, or entecavir) pegIFN-2a with TDF-based therapies at 48 weeks does not increase the seroconversion rate of HBeAg-positive patients coinfected with HBV and HIV. a 15% sinecatechin ointment (Veregen) is the first FDA-approved botanical drug for the topical treatment of external genital warts (357). the clearance rate with 15% sinecatechin ointment reaches 54%, and the recurrence rate is 7% at 12 weeks (356). podofilox is a cytotoxic drug with specific pharmacological actions against the formation of the mitotic spindle at metaphase. the internal use of podofilox in either the vagina or the anus is not recommended. the most common side effects with podofilox are inflammation, burning, erosion, pain, or itching. interferon alfacon 1, pegylated interferon alfa 2a (PegIFN-2a) and PegIFN-2b (Table 2). interferon alfacon 1 has been discontinued since September 2013. interferon-free drugs are now effective against HCV infections. amino acid K23 in interferon alfa 2a and amino acid R23 in interferon alfa 2b mark the only sequence difference between interferon alfa 2a and interferon alfa 2b. catechin is the major ingredient of the botanical drug sinecatechin. 5% imiquimod cream (Aldara) is a patient-applied immune response modifier. it stimulates macrophages to secrete cytokines (e.g., interferon alpha, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1 [IL-1], IL-6, and IL-8) for wart regression and local inflammatory reactions (352, 353) veregen is a purified product of catechins from leaves of Chinese green tea containing >80% catechins and polyphenols. catechins are known for their antiangiogenic activity, anti-inflammatory and immunostimulatory activities, and antimicrobial potential (358). antisense oligonucleotides Fomivirsen is the first FDA-approved antisense oligonucleotide harboring a 21-nucleotide phosphorothioate oligonucleotide. the binding of fomivirsen to this region inhibits the gene expression of essential HCMV proteins. the combination of sofosbuvir (400 mg) plus velpatasvir (100 mg) has been recognized as an effective pangenotypic therapy against infections by HCV genotypes 1 to 6 (375, 376) the combination of sofosbuvir (400 mg) plus velpatasvir (100 mg) has been recognized as an effective pangenotypic therapy against infections by HCV genotypes 1 to 6. combination drug of sofosbuvir plus velpatasvir was superior to therapy with sofosbuvir plus ribavirin. ASTRAL-1 trial enrolled 740 patients with noncirrhotic or compensated cirrhosis. two randomized clinical trials enrolled 321 and 377 patients, respectively. phase 3 clinical trials were established to study a fixed-dose combination of daclatasvir (60 mg, once daily) plus asunaprevir (100 mg, twice daily) (285) and a twice-daily fixed-dose combination of daclatasvir (30 mg) plus asunaprevir (200 mg) plus beclabuvir (75 mg) (381, 382) combination of the HCV protease inhibitor asunaprevir with daclatasvir was daclatasvir plus asunaprevir plus beclabuvir achieved promising rates (>85%) of SVR12 (383) the most common side effects with this combination drug were headache, diarrhea, fatigue, and nausea (381, 382) results of a phase 3 trial recruiting 985 patients will be released by the end of 2016. letermovir Letermovir is a 3,4-dihydro-quinazoline-4-yl-acetic acid derivative that targets the pUL56 subunit of the HCMV terminase complex to block viral DNA processing and/or packaging. the combination of sofosbuvir (400 mg) plus velpatasvir (100 mg) has been recognized as an effective pangenotypic therapy against infections by HCV genotypes 1 to 6 (375, 376) the combination of sofosbuvir plus velpatasvir was submitted to the FDA as new drug application on 28 October 2015. treatment with sofosbuvir (400 mg) plus velpatasvir (100 mg, once daily) showed a success rate of SVR12 of up to 97.4% (n = 1,221) treatment with sofosbuvir (400 mg, once daily) plus velpatasvir (100 mg, once daily) showed a success rate of SVR12 of up to 97.4% (n = 1,221). phase 3 clinical trials were established to study daclatasvir daclatasvir is an FDA-approved inhibitor targeting HCV NS5A. beclabuvir is an experimental inhibitor targeting HCV NS5B. combination of the HCV protease inhibitor asunaprevir with daclatasvir was approved in japan, but the FDA has not approved this combination as of April 2016. aprevir (200 mg) plus beclabuvir (75 mg) showed a success rate of SVR12 of up to 91.5% (n = 546). aprevir (200 mg) plus beclabuvir (75 mg) showed a success rate of SVR12 of up to 91.5% (n = 546) letermovir Letermovir is a 3,4-dihydro-quinazoline-4-yl-acetic acid derivative. it targets the pUL56 subunit of the HCMV terminase complex to block viral DNA processing and/or packaging. the first proof-of-concept trial identified virus clearance in 6 of 12 patients (50%) who received 14 days of letermovir. ic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients will show the efficacy and safety of 240 mg letermovir in preventing HCMV infections 24 weeks after transplant actions. results of this clinical trial will be released in 2017. there is growing interest in developing new treatments against emerging infectious diseases (394) two live-attenuated VZV vaccines were licensed against varicella in 1995 and against herpes zoster in 2006. the mean effectiveness of a single dose of the varicella vaccine is 80 to 85% against all levels of disease severity (397). three vaccines have been approved for different HPV types. a significant variation of influenza virus strains may cause resistance to antiviral agents. optimal antiviral treatments are yet to be discovered (399, 401) Viruses Targeted by antiviral drugs but not by Vaccines. approved vaccines are available for 13 infectious diseases. but their antiviral drugs are still lacking. cidofovir can effectively inhibit viral infections with human adenovirus. no antiviral compound is formally approved for HEV. preliminary clinical observations suggest that pegylated interferon and ribavirin alone might offer a sustained virological response. in vivo evidence from clinical trials is lacking (413) as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human parvovirus B19 (419, 420), human norovirus (421), human rhinovirus (422), human coronavirus (423), human astrovirus (423), human sapovirus (425), chikungunya virus (426), dengue virus (426), west Nile virus (427), Hendra virus (328), Nipah virus (328), Marburg virus (MARV), Lassa virus (430), Juni human herpesvirus 6 was first isolated in patients with lymphoproliferative disorders in 1986 (437) there is no vaccine or drug licensed for human herpesvirus 6 but one experimental compound (R)-9-[4-hydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)butyl]guanine (H2G) and four drugs approved for other clinical uses are under investigation. most infections by human parvovirus B19 in immunocompetent patients do not require any treatment. 0.95% of Zika virus infections in pregnant women may lead to microcephaly (abnormally small head) in infants (441). a vaccine, antiviral compound, or good serological test is not available for Zika virus today (442). a safe and effective vaccine will probably take 3 to 10 years (443, 444) dengue virus, discovered in the 1960s, is the cause of several pandemics (426) many experimental inhibitors have been designed to target the NS4B and NS5 proteins of dengue virus (450, 451) but it remains a challenge to develop dengue virus vaccines with optimal efficacy against all 4 dengue virus serotypes. astrovirus and sapovirus are transmitted primarily through the fecal-oral route (424, 425) both zoonotic viruses were originally transmitted from bats to humans (458) as of April 2016, there is no vaccine or antiviral drug licensed for EBOV and MARV. only 7 human Hendra virus infections have been reported since 1994 (462) ribavirin can efficiently inhibit henipavirus replication (328) ribavirin may be used as an off-label treatment for henipavirus infections in the absence of other therapies (328). three HBV vaccines have been approved for all HBV genotypes. effectiveness of universal HBV vaccine coverage is 75%. influenza vaccines have their limitations (399, 400) after influenza vaccination, it takes up to 2 weeks in adults and 6 weeks in children to develop immunity. the effectiveness of influenza vaccination is impaired by many factors (e.g., vaccine mismatch, immunosuppression, or lack of compliance) x and Varivax were licensed against varicella in 1995 and against herpes zoster in 2006. mean effectiveness of a single dose of the varicella vaccine is 80 to 85% against all levels of disease severity (397). three vaccines have been approved for different HPV types. the significant variation of influenza virus strains may cause resistance to antiviral agents. optimal antiviral treatments are yet to be discovered (399, 401) vaccines are available for 13 infectious diseases, but their antiviral drugs are still lacking. cidofovir can efficiently inhibit viral infections with human adenovirus, but clinical evidence is still lacking. cidofovir can effectively inhibit viral infections with human adenovirus. rabies infections are generally treatable by using postexposure prophylaxis with the administration of rabies immunoglobulin and vaccine (414) for viral infections like polio, yellow fever, and measles, adequate protection can be achieved by vaccination in some circumstances. cidofovir might be an off-label prescription to treat various DNA virus infections such as human polyomavirus, adenovirus, and smallpox (416) human polyomavirus 6 (127), human coronavirus (423), human astrovirus (424), human sapovirus (425), chikungunya virus (426), dengue virus (426), west Nile virus (427), Hendra virus (328), Nipah virus (328), Ebola virus (428, 429), Marburg virus (MARV), Lassa virus (430), Junin virus (430), Machupo virus (431), and, most recently human parvovirus B19, discovered in 1975, is the best-known virus in the group of ssDNA viruses. most infections by human parvovirus B19 in immunocompetent patients do not require any treatment, because the symptoms are transient. intravenous immunoglobulin therapy substantially increases reticulocyte counts and hemoglobin levels, but 33.9% of treated patients may have a relapse at a mean of 4.3 months (438) a vaccine, antiviral compound, or good serological test is not available for Zika virus today. a safe and effective vaccine will probably take 3 to 10 years. human norovirus was first identified in stored human stool samples in 1972. dengue virus, discovered in the 1960s, is the cause of several pandemics (426) many experimental inhibitors have been designed to target the NS4B and NS5 proteins of dengue virus (450, 451) veterinary vaccines have been licensed for use in horses and dogs (454, 455) and small-molecule inhibitors (456, 457) against human west Nile virus are still under investigation. bola, marburg, Hendra, Nipah, Lassa, Junin, and Machupo viruses were first discovered in 1976 and 1967. both zoonotic viruses were originally transmitted from bats to humans. as of April 2016, there is no vaccine or antiviral drug licensed for EBOV and MARV. ribavirin can efficiently inhibit henipavirus replication (328) preliminary clinical observations suggest that ribavirin may inhibit human Hendra and Nipah virus infections. ribavirin might be used as off-label treatment for henipavirus infections in the absence of other therapies. human polyomavirus was first discovered by Ludwik Gross in 1953. the best-known types of human polyomaviruses are JC and BK viruses. human monoclonal antibodies target viral protein 1 of JC virus to inhibit JC virus infections. intravenous immunoglobulin therapy significantly increases reticulocyte counts and hemoglobin levels, but 33.9% of treated patients may have a relapse at a mean of 4.3 months (438) cidofovir at 500 M could significantly reduce virus infectivity in vitro, but clinical evidence is still required (439) many antiviral agents (e.g., EV71, ribavirin, and favipiravir) effectively inhibit norovirus protease or RNA polymerase. their development is still at an early stage (325, 326) human coronavirus, discovered in the 1960s, is known to cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) veterinary vaccines have been licensed for use in horses and dogs (454, 455) and small-molecule inhibitors (456, 457) against human west Nile virus are still under investigation. the development of vaccines and antiviral agents against human astrovirus and sapovirus is slow. a recent study suggests that AVI-7288, which is a phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer, acts as postexposure prophylaxis for MARV infections in humans (461) the efficacy of antiviral candidates against MARV has yet to be fully proven in clinical trials (327). ribavirin can efficiently inhibit henipavirus replication (328) favipiravir can effectively inhibit viral replication of arenaviruses (Junin, Machupo, and Pichinde viruses) for vaccine development, human HLA class I-restricted epitopes have been explored for human arenaviruses. vaccine development for Lassa virus and filoviruses is hindered by a lack of commercial interest (464) as of April 2016, many antiviral drugs and/or vaccines have been approved for the treatment of 22 infectious diseases. however, there is still no antiviral drug or vaccine for more than 200 infectious diseases that are afflicting human populations worldwide. no Off-label druga Poxviridae Variola virus (smallpox) Yes Off-label druga II (ssDNA) Reoviridae Rotavirus Yes No IV [(+)ssRNA] Astroviridae Human astrovirus No No Caliciviridae Human coronavirus No No Flaviviridae HCV No Yes Yellow fever virus Yes No Japanese encephalitis virus Yes No Dengue, West Nile, Zika viruses No antiviral compounds with broad-spectrum activity against different virus genotypes or subtypes are still welcome. many antiviral drugs (e.g., amprenavir) inhibit only HIV-1 but not HIV-2 (173). many antiviral drugs have been approved only for HCV genotype 1 but not for other genotypes. efficient antiviral treatments against viral coinfections require further investigations. sixth, access to and delivery of costly new therapies are becoming problematic in resource-limited settings (474) political and financial commitment is also vital to eliminate substandard and counterfeit antiviral drugs."}
