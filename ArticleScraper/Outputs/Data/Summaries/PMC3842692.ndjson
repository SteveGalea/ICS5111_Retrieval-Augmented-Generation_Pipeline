{"summary": "objective Cineole has mucolytic, bronchodilating and anti-inflammatory properties. a total of 242 patients with confirmed acute bronchitis were randomly selected to participate. the primary outcome measure was a Bronchitis Sum Score, which summarises the relevant symptoms of acute bronchitis. the primary goal should be the reduction of the frequency of cough fits. treatment with antitussives is not recommended and should be reserved for specific exceptions. the main constituent of eucalyptus oil is Cineole, which has been proven to be effective in the treatment of respiratory diseases. each group amounted to 1 capsule, taken 3 times daily, resulting in a total dose of 600 mg of Cineole per day. all patients were instructed to take the capsules with mineral water, half an hour before meals. all capsules were organoleptically identical and sealed in blister stripes. scores 0 = no coughing fits per day, 1 = one coughing fit per day, 2 = 2 \u2013 3 coughing fits per day, 4 = 4\u20139 coughing fits per day, 5 = > 15 coughing fits per day (unbearable often) symptom-scores were determined for dyspnea frequency and intensity during rest. randomisation Randomisation was sequentially assigned in balanced blocks of 4 from a computer-generated list (random, idv Data-Analysis& Study Planning, Krailling, Germany) control visits were carried out after 4 and 10 days, when adverse events were recorded. control visits were carried out after 4 and 10 days, when adverse events were recorded and compliance with the treatment plan. patients were randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups. each group amounted to 1 capsule, taken 3 times daily, resulting in a total dose of 600 mg of Cineole per day. coughing fits were documented according to patients diary with the scores 0 = no coughing fits per day, 1 = one coughing fit per day, 2 = 2 \u2013 3 coughing fits per day, 3 = 4\u20135 coughing fits per day, 4 = 4\u20139 coughing fits per day. complaints, 2 = in the morning with complaints, 3 = in the morning and over the day (moderate), 3 = in the morning and over the day (severe), 5 = continuously during whole day (moderate complaints) and 6 = continuously during whole day (relevant complaints) randomisation was sequentially assigned in balanced blocks of 4 from a computer-generated list (random, idv Data-Analysis& Study Planning, Krailling, Germany) both treatment groups were well matched with respect to the baseline characteristics. the mean age of the participants at entry was 41.0 and 43.9 years in the respective groups. the medication generally was not changed during the 10 days treatment period. difference was calculated as 6.82 or 6.52. comparisons of other single parameters of the Bronchitis-Sum-Score generally failed to show a statistically significant difference between both treatment groups. the frequency of coughing fits was 0.64 (0.87) 1.18 (1.12) 0.0001. bDefinition of cough documentation is specified by scores: 0 = no cough, 1 = in the morning without complaints, 2 = in the morning with complaints, 3 = in the morning and over the day. a further AE was interpreted as being related to an intolerance of the study medication (i.e. heartburn and burning mouth) after 4 days of treatment the mean decrease was 3.55 score-points in the Cineole group, and 2.91 score-points in the placebo-group. the difference between both treatment groups was found to be distinctive, yet not statistically significant at the 3rd control-visit after 10 days. the predominant parameter \u201ccough\u201d did not show a characteristic difference between both treatments. therefore, comparing coughing, or rather the cough frequency requires the correct definition, in order to show the different progress of symptoms. bDefinition of cough documentation is specified by scores: 0 = no cough, 1 = in the morning without complaints, 2 = in the morning with complaints, 3 = in the morning and over the day, 4 = continuously during whole day (moderate complaints) a further AE was interpreted as being related to an intolerance of the study medication. the difference between the two treatment groups was neither clinically relevant, nor statistically significant. a controlled clinical trial, based on Cineole as the main constituent of eucalyptus oil, had not yet been carried out on acute bronchitis. this is a major concern in practice, because only a minority of patients will visit their physician immediately, following the recognition the first symptoms of acute bronchitis. the difference between the two groups, following 10 days of treatment with the study medication, no longer showed to be statistically significant. the difference between the two groups, based on the symptom-sum-score and the frequency of coughing fits, decreased after 10 days. chitis is the main and predominant criterion for the definition of acute bronchitis. but other parameters have only minor influence on the results. the findings are complementary with these former results."}
