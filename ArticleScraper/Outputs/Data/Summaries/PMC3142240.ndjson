{"summary": "quantitative real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) is currently the most accurate and sensitive method used for quantitative gene expression analysis. RT-qPCR is currently the most accurate and sensitive method used for quantitative gene expression analysis. several other insect genomes have been completed since the report of the fruit fly genome sequence in 2000 [1]. several other insect genomes have been completed including three mosquitoes species, silkworm, honeybee, red flour beetle, pea aphid, three closely related parasitoid wasps and human body louse [2-5]. a considerable number of other insect genomes are in progress [6] MRCV causes the most important maize disease in Argentina. no planthopper genonome sequencing project has yet been announced. a robust RT-qPCR platform was set up for analyzing changes on gene expression upon MRCV infection in individual planthoppers. the RC MRCV isolate from the endemic disease area was maintained on oat plants through successive transmissions by D. kuscheli. oligonucleotides were designed from conserved regions of publicly available insect sequences of the actin (ACT), -1-tubulin (TUB), elongation factor 1- (EF1A), ribosomal protein S18 (RPS18), gliceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and polyubiquitin C (UBI) genes. all Delphacodes kuscheli sequences were purified using QIAquick gel extraction kit (QIAGEN, Germany) they were cloned into pGemT Easy (Promega, USA) and sequenced. the sequences of primers used for RT-qPCR analysis are listed on Table 1.

RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis Total RNA was extracted from each planthopper using the Trizol basic protocol. previous to the extraction the sample was pulverized by freezing in liquid nitrogen and homogenized in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. second, during the isopropanol precipitation 20 g of glycogen was added as a carrier. all Delphacodes kuscheli sequences were purified using QIAquick gel extraction kit (QIAGEN, Germany) they were cloned into pGemT Easy (Promega, USA) and sequenced. the sequences of primers were deposited in the GenBank database. kuscheli selected candidate genes for RT-qPCR Name Symbol Function GenBank Accession Primer sequences (5' to 3') A (bp) E (%) Actin ACT Cytoskeleton/Muscle contraction HM565964 FW: AGCGTGGTTTTTCCTTCACAAC RV: GGCCATTTCCTCTTCTC100 82 Elongation factor 1- EF1A Translation HM565967 FW: TTGAGGCTGGTATCTC Quantitative real time PCR and data analysis RT-qPCR experiments were carried out using the QuantiTec SYBR Green PCR kit (QIAGEN, Germany) the results were exported as raw data, and introduced to the LinReg software [36] for baseline correction and PCR efficiency calculations. only 4 out of 50 independently evaluated insects were capable of successfully transmitting MRCV to wheat plants. RNA extraction was performed from each planthopper using a Trizol protocol adapted to the small size of the samples. i sequences showed 95%, 86%, 92%, 92%, 92%, 90% and 84% identity to Nilaparvata lugens ESTs sequences. the 18S rRNA primers were based on an available Laodelphax striatellus sequence [GenBank: AB085211] the calculated PCR efficiency means ranged from 82% for UBI and TUB to 55% for 18S. RT-qPCR experiments carried as described in Methods. ACT was the most stable gene with M= 0.4738, followed by UBI, GADPH, 18S and RPS18 with similar M coefficients. EF1A and TUB were listed as the most stable genes with M > 1.2. the pair-wise variation V of two consecutive normalization factors (NF) resulted from stepwise introduction of another gene (the one with the lowest M remaining) if we consider the generally adopted threshold of V = 0.15 [37,41,42], the inclusion of a third, fourth and fifth gene does not result in appreciable improvement of the normalization factor. the threshold was only reached when adding the two most stable genes (Figure 2B) Normfinder ranked GAPDH as the most stable gene, whereas geNorm considered it the third most stable. bestKeeper Excel tool analyzes each gene's expression variability by calculating the Ct set standard deviation (SD) and coefficient of variance (CV). bestkeeper index calculates the correlation between the genes and with the bestkeeper index. ACT and 18S are the most reliable reference gene for quantitative analysis of MRCV-infective planthopper mRNA levels by RT-qPCR. the ACT gene has been recently employed as an internal control for the spotted wilt virus quantification in individual thrip vectors. ACT second lowest Ct is in agreement with the usually abundant actin mRNA in cells. expression levels of candidate reference genes in nave versus MRCV-infective planthoppers were statistically evaluated by the Mann-Whitney t test. differences between treatments were calculated by the Mann-Whitney t test using the Graphpad Prism 5 software. one-to-one transmission assays were performed to obtain MRCV-infective insects. only 4 out of 50 independently evaluated insects were capable of successfully transmitting MRCV to wheat plants. ethanol storage was chosen for further experiments because it was a simpler procedure. osomal protein S18 (RPS18), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and polyubiquitin C (UBI) sequences showed 95%, 86%, 92%, 92%, 92%, 90% and 84% identity to Nilaparvata lugens ESTs sequences. RT-qPCR oligonucleotides were designed for each of the D. kuscheli RT-qPCR assay carried out to examine expression stability of the 7 candidate genes. total RNA was extracted from the previously obtained MRCV-infective planthoppers along with control (nave) individuals. the concentration was precisely quantified with a spectrophotometer. geNorm found that the most stable pair of reference genes was ACT/GAPDH (Figure 2A) which displayed the first and third place in the individual stability ranking. the program calculates the pair-wise variation V of two consecutive normalization factors (NF) that result from stepwise introduction of another gene (the one with the lowest M remaining) [37,41,42], the inclusion of a third gene does not result in appreciable improvement of the normalization factor. Normfinder ranked GAPDH as the most stable gene followed by 18S, ACT and RPS18. this is in accordance with geNorm results, which situated UBI as the second most stable gene after ACT. Normfinder ranked GAPDH as the most unstable gene. a group of a low variability and high stability composed of UBI, ACT, 18S and RPS18 and a second one more variable and unstable composed of EF1A and TUB. the results indicate that UBI is the most reliable reference gene for quantitative analysis of MRCV-infective planthopper mRNA levels. whiskers represent the maximum and minimum values. the genes were ordered from the least (higher Ct, to the left) to the most abundantly expressed (lower Ct, to the right). differences between treatments were statistically evaluated for each gene. the EF1A gene was upregulated in MRCV-infected planthoppers so it shouldn't be used as an internal control. RT-qPCR platform developed along this work will also be useful for normalizing viral titers in insect vectors. authors declare that they have no competing interests. total RNA was frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -70\u00b0C. next total RNA was extracted and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. additional file 2 Analysis of the performance of the designed primers."}
