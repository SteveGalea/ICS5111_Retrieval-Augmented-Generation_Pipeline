NN-align method is designed to deal with unaligned peptide data. it identifies a core of consecutive amino acids within the peptide sequences that constitute an informative motif. NN-align was originally developed with the unaligned nature of peptide-MHC class II interaction in mind. the user can submit quantitative peptide data to the web server at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NNAlign. a trained method can be used to predict the occurrence of the learned motif in one or more concurrently submitted peptide sequences or FASTA format sequences. the default settings will in most cases allow the user to define a motif length. the results page provides links to a scatter-plot showing the correlation between measured and predicted values. a sequence logo gives a visual representation of the identified sequence motif. a section of the results will report the predictions of this evaluation set. the estimated performance of the trained method is expressed in terms of root Mean Square Error, Pearson and Spearman correlation. a visual representation of the correlation can be obtained from the scatterplot of predicted versus observed values. if an evaluation set is uploaded, an additional section shows performance measures and core alignment for these data. the predictive performance of NNAlign on 12 human MHC class I alleles is shown in Table 1. the benchmark data sets contain quantitative binding data of a given length (9 amino acids) covering the whole spectrum from non-binding to strong-binding peptides. the overall performances of the three methods are comparable. 0.845 A*2902 160 0.911 0.935 0.920 DRB1*0802 1017 0.698 0.689 0.641 0.714 A*3101 1869 0.930 0.928 0.931 DRB1*0901 1042 0.713 0.696 0.745 A*6801 1141

flanking region length, and an ensemble of 2, 3, 5, 9 and 12 hidden neurons for each of 10 initial random configurations. in bold is highlighted the best performing method for each MHC allele. the difference with the original NN-align method is small and not significant (p>0.2, binomial test) the server competes with comparable state-of-the-art methods. the best motif length is the one that yields the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) between observed and predicted values. for the 14 HLA-DR molecules included in the benchmark, only one was found to have a single consistent optimal motif length. however, all motif lengths fell in the range of 7 to 10 amino acids. in all cases a 9-mer motif was compatible with being the optimal motif length. different networks from the ensemble trained on binding data are shown in panels A through D. each network identifies the same strong primary anchor residues and positions. however, each single network identifies different ends. the weak C-terminal primary anchor residue of HLA*DRB1-04:01 probably explains why the boundaries are difficult to determine. peptide length and flanking region length, and PFRs of 3 amino acids, homology clustering at threshold 0.8 using all data points, 20 hidden neurons and a 5-fold cross-validation without stopping on the best test set performance. each network is aligned to a common register using the offset correction strategy previously described. the sequence logos reflect the overall consensus of the binding motifs for HLA-DR molecules. peptide sequences were synthesized using the theme Ac-GAGAXXXXGAGA. peptide sequences were synthesized using the theme Ac-GAGAXXXXGAGA. the peptide sequences were synthesized using the theme Ac-GAGAXXXXGAGA. the correlation scatterplot feature of the NNAlign web-server output reveals two major populations of peptides. few (0.7%) of the former peptides contained Arginine, whereas most (97.1%) of latter peptides contained Arginine. this is exactly what one would have expected from a peptide digestion with trypsin, known to cleave at the C-terminal side of amino acids Arginine. the protease has recognized the protease as a substrate and cleaved it somewhere. the image is a magnified segment of the peptide chip used in trypsin cleavage analysis. a high-density peptide microarray containing about 50,000 peptides was generated according to the theme Ac-GAGAXXXGAGA. the resulting data was used to train an NNAlign method. the correlation scatterplot of the measured versus predicted values exhibits a very strong linear correlation with a Pearson of r = 0.943. alleles on 14 HLA-DR MHC class II alleles (Peters data set) and on 14 HLA-DR MHC class II alleles. alleles on 14 HLA-DR MHC class II alleles. 0.765 B*5301 254 0.882 0.899 0.875

found in predicted performance. identifying the binding motif and binding register for binding peptides is therefore a problem that inherently requires simultaneous alignment and binding affinity identification. the performance of NNAlign on the Wang set is compared to other publicly available methods for MHC class II prediction. the difference with the original NN-align method is small and not significant. NNalign will report the length associated with the lowest RMSE value as the optimal motif length. the method identified more than one possible optimal motif length. for the 14 HLA-DR molecules included in the benchmark, only one was found to have a single consistent optimal motif length. a single consistent optimal motif length of 9 amino acids is found. for DRB1*0101 a single consistent optimal motif length 8\u201311 had statistically indistinguishable performance (paired t-test) off-set correction is included as an integral part of the method to enhance motif visualization. sequence logos for HLA*DRB1-0401 are shown in panels a to d. offset correction was used to realign the logos to a common register. motifs of DRB1*0301 and DRB1*1101 have strong preference for charged amino acids at P4 and P6 respectively. some dramatic deviations from this general pattern exist. a peptide microarray containing >100,000 peptides was digested with protease trypsin. the resulting data was log-transformed and rescaled to obtain a data distribution covering the spectrum between 0 and 1, which was used to train an NNAlign method. the prediction method yielded a Pearson correlation between measured values and predictions of r = 0.971 and a Spearman correlation of = 0.910. the correlation scatterplot feature of the NNAlign web-server output, which compares predicted vs. observed values, further supports the validity of both the some (97.1%) of latter peptides contained Arginine. this is exactly what one would have expected from a peptide digestion with trypsin. RP sequences are resistant, RA sequences are quite susceptible, and RR sequences appear extremely susceptible to trypsin digestion. proline (P) is known to prevent cleavage after arginine (R) whereas cleavage is observed with other amino acids such as R and A. c) Chymotrypsin peptide-chip data. values are binned by their x,y proximity, so that the scatterplot represents the density of data in each bin. the amount of data deposited in genomic and proteomic databases has been growing exponentially for many years [36] due to recent technological advances that have enabled whole-genome sequencing and made whole-proteome analysis a realistic goal. sequence data will accumulate at an even faster pace in the future where single laboratories, even single experiments, can generate data at the \u201comics\u201d level. motif discovery, MEME [39], can perform searches for un-gapped sequence patterns in DNA or protein sequences. the method is not designed for quantitative data, such as peptide-MHC binding or peptide microarray data. it is the first web-based bioinformatics solution that allows non-expert users to discover short sequence motifs in quantitative peptide data. quantitative peptide-MHC class I binding affinity data published by Peters et al. contains data from 48 different human, mouse, macaque and chimpanzee alleles. we selected 12 representative human alleles, and extracted binding data for 9-mer peptides maintaining the subset of the original benchmark. oc-groups were removed in 20% piperidine in NMP and replaced by NPPOC groups coupled as the chloroformate in DCM with 0.1 M DIEA. final cleavage of side protection groups was performed in TFA1,2-ethanedithiolwater 9424 v/v/v for 2 h at room temperature. peptide array slides were washed in the incubation buffer without fluorochrome. images were recorded using a MVX10 microscope equipped with a MT10_D fluorescence illumination system. the excitation wavelength was 530\u2013550 nm and the emission filter was 575\u2013625 nm. data into n subsets randomly; ii) homology clustering, uses a Hobohm 1 algorithm [44] to identify sequences that share an ungapped alignment with more than a specified fraction of matches. similar sequences are grouped together in the same subset, but it is possible to choose to only include one representative for each group. multiple runs of ANN training are performed on the different lengths. the length that produces the best cross-validated performance in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) is chosen for the final ensemble. each architecture is trained multiple times, starting from different initial random configurations. each network has been evaluated on data not included in cross-validation training. only the top N for each cross-validation step will be included in the final ensemble, with N specified by the user. the final network ensemble can be downloaded to local disk, and used for predictions on new data. the ANN final ensemble and selecting the 1% peptides that obtain the overall best score can be uploaded to the NNAlign Server as an evaluation set. the results are sorted by prediction value, so that the best candidates are displayed at the top of the list. polar amino acids (C, G, S, T, Y) are shown in green and (N, Q) pink, basic (K. R, H) in blue, acidic (D, E) in red, and hydrophobic (A, L, I, V, F, M, P, W) in black. quantitative peptide-MHC class I binding affinity data published by Peters et al. contains data from 48 different human, mouse, macaque and chimpanzee the couplings were made using standard Fmoc-amino acids activated with HBTU/DIEA in NMP. all Fmoc-groups were removed in 20% piperidine in NMP and replaced by NPPOC groups coupled as the chloroformate in DCM with 0.1 M DIEA. the procedure was repeated until all amino acids had been added to the growing peptide chains. amino groups exposed by enzyme cleavage made by incubation the slides for 10 min in 1 mM 5(6)-TAMRA activated with 1 eq HBTU, 2 eq DIEA in n-methylpyrrolidone. images were recorded using a MVX10 microscope equipped with a MT10_D fluorescence illumination system and a XM10 CCD camera. rypsin dissolved in 0.1 M Tris/Acetate pH 8.0. slides were washed in 1 mM 5(6)-TAMRA activated with 1 eq HBTU, 2 eq DIEA in n-methylpyrrolidone and air-dried. images were recorded using a MVX10 microscope. the parameters for the rescaling function are defined separately on each of the training sets used in cross-validation. n subsets are created from the complete dataset, and at each step n-1 subsets are used for training and 1 subset for testing. common motif clustering looks for stretches of identical amino acid between pairs of sequences. the method selects the optimal n-mer core (and potential peptide flanking residues) for each of the peptides within the training set. the network weights are next updated to lower the sum of squared errors between the observed and predicted score. the cores are redefined based on the new network configuration. n-fold cross-validation (CV) consists of a nested CV procedure. at each step, 1 subset is left out as evaluation set. the remaining subsets are used to generate a network ensemble in an n-1 CV training. the re-aligned cores from the 1% scoring of 100,000 peptides are finally used to generate a combined sequence logo with the WebLogo program [48] the user is given the option to apply a logarithmic transformation to the raw data, if its distribution appears to be too squashed towards low. outliers deviating more than 3 standard deviations from the average are set at a value of exactly 3 standard deviations. the rescaling function produces ideal data for artificial neural network (ANN) training, with all values in the range [01] and the bulk of the data in the central region of the spectrum. neural network training is performed as described by Nielsen et al. [20]. the method selects the optimal n-mer core (and potential peptide flanking residues) for each of the peptides within the training set. the cores are redefined based on the new network configuration. n-fold cross-validation (CV) consists of a nested CV procedure. at each step, 1 subset is left out as evaluation set. the remaining subsets are used to generate a network ensemble in an n-1 CV training. this \u201coffset correction\u201d step is obtained by repeatedly attempting to shift the starting position of randomly chosen PSSMs. the process assigns to each PSSM, and to its relative network, an offset value that quantifies the shift distance from other networks. the re-aligned cores from the 1% scoring of 100,000 peptides are finally used to generate a combined sequence logo with the WebLogo program. the height Ri of each column i in the logo is given as the information content in bits of the alignment at that particular position. for a sufficiently large number of sequences and a 20-letter alphabet it is calculated as: where fa,I is the frequency of amino acid a at position i."}
