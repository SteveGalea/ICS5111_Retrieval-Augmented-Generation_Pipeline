{"summary": "polymerase chain reaction (PCR) invented by Kary Mullis and honoured with the noble prize is still the most relevant nucleic acid amplification technolo gy. PCR could be established in-house in many laboratories worldwide with little effort and reasonable costs. internal controls could be included and discriminated from the target sequence by labelling with different fluorophores. a congressional investigation committee on HIV infections through blood and blood products was established. 60% of infections among recipients of blood and blood products in Germany could have been prevented [13] a list of recommendations was suggested on how to increase blood safety. NAT testing of batches of clotting factors, immunoglobulins, and production pools revealed high HCV contamination rates. the findings promoted the idea of testing donor blood by NAT in addition to antibodies and antigen testing before the manufacturing process begins. PCR was well established for patient diagnostics; however, screening of thousands of healthy and mostly negative blood donors per day required quite different approaches. in 1998, the first data were published on the routine screening of mini pools of up to 600 donations for HCV, HBV, and HIV-1 by PCR. the PEI mandated from July 1, 1999 the HCV NAT testing of labile blood components in Germany with a detection limit of 5,000 IU/mL per individual donation [25]. commercial assays for HIV-1 and HBV were not available and not all blood banks had access to in-house methods. real-time PCR enabled detection of the amplicons without opening the reaction tube. if laboratories were contaminated, the blood supply was in danger. this problem could be solved by the invention of real-time PCR. the highest yield has been obtained with HCV NAT according to the long pre-seroconversion window, the explosive ramp-up phase, and high plateau phase concentration of HCV. the first comprehensive data on the NAT yield were reported in 2008 from Germany and revealed 23 HCV, 7 HIV-1, and 43 HBV NAT-only positives among 30 million tested donors. only 1 HCV and 2 HIV-1 transmissions observed in Germany since NAT testing has commenced. only the HCV transmitting donation had a low viral load which was even below the LOD of the most sensitive single donation test kits. one NAT company introduced a triple target HIV-1 PCR. the rapid provision of sensitive and specific diagnostic tests was of utmost importance to halt the epidemic. only NAT tests could instantly be developed and provided for patient and blood donor diagnostics. recent studies revealed a high percentage of hepatitis E virus (HEV)-infected blood donors and frequent transmission of the virus by blood components. samples taken from late antibodies against hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc)-positive tail end phase were 100-times less infectious. hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc)-positive tail end phase was 100-times less infectious. anti-HBc testing is highly sensitive and sufficiently specific in detecting chronic occult carriers with low level viremia. discontinuing HBsAg testing would save money since HBV NAT is included in all commercial NAT test kits designed for blood screening. NAT precedes array detection to increase sensitivity. amplification with subsequent array detection prolongs the time to result. costs are far higher than with NAT alone and most likely will not come down to same level. a number of alternative NAT methods have been developed, mostly isothermal. none have been developed to a similar maturity for blood screening as PCR and TMA. this may include increased multiplexing capabilities and total lab automation. NAT for blood donor testing: the Triggers In the early 1980s data accumulated indicating that AIDS is an infectious disease caused by an unknown virus preferably spreading in the male homosexual community. such alarming data triggered studies on the residual risk of transfusion-transmitted HCV, HIV-1, and hepatitis B virus infections. a congressional investigation committee on HIV infections through blood and blood products was established. 60% of infections among recipients of blood and blood products in Germany could have been prevented [13] a list of recommendations was suggested on how to increase blood safety. the CPMP pushed HCV NAT for manufacturing plasma pool testing. the detection limit should be equivalent to a run control with an HCV RNA content of 100 IU/mL. manufacturers implemented pretesting of mini pools consisting of samples from hundreds of donations. in 1998, the first data were published on the routine screening of mini pools of up to 600 donations for HCV, HBV, and HIV-1 by PCR. a further study performed on smaller pools of 96 samples reported no viremic seronegative donation among 332 thousand tested. the first data demonstrating the reliability and feasibility of blood donor screening by PCR were published in 1999 after the testing of 373 thousand donations. NAT testing of labile blood components in Germany with a detection limit of 5,000 IU/mL per individual donation. the PEI wisely abstained from mandating a pool size for blood screening with the intention to leave open the field for different technological and logistical approaches. commercial assays for HIV-1 and HBV were not available. blood banks were the first to adopt the technology for their in-house NAT. real-time PCR also paved the way to an increasing degree of automation and noticeable cost reduction. the group focused on the development of international standards for blood screening with the first HCV WHO standard for NAT assays established in 1997. the first comprehensive data on the NAT yield were reported in 2008 from Germany and revealed 23 HCV, 7 HIV-1, and 43 HBV NAT-only positives among 30 million tested donors. in the USA, 244 HCV and 32 HIV-1 NAT-only positives were identified among 66 million tested, as reported in 2010. the HIV-1 transmissions were due to mutations in the primer/probe binding sites resulting in false negative NAT test results. one NAT company introduced a triple target HIV-1 PCR. the impact of NAT testing on blood safety was not restricted to the well-known transfusion-relevant viruses. recent studies revealed a high percentage of hepatitis E virus (HEV)-infected blood donors and frequent transmission of the virus by blood components. some countries have already introduced HEV NAT screening of blood donations, including the UK, Ireland, the Netherlands, and recently Switzerland. NAT tests for many more emerging and re-emerging viruses have been developed suitable for blood screening. the infectious dose for HIV-1 was calculated by reverse probit analysis of the viral load of transmitting and non-transmitting donations. the minimal infectious dose of HBV assessed in the chimpanzee and humanized mouse models was in good accordance. the frequent occurrence of chronic occult HBV infection occurs as well. sAg testing doubles screening for the virus with no obvious advantage in sensitivity compared to NAT testing [55] alternative technologies science and technology has advanced rapidly since the introduction of virus NAT testing in transfusion medicine. amplification with subsequent array detection prolongs the time to result and increases costs. sensitivity is not yet competitive with high-throughput digital droplet PCR. high-throughput digital droplet PCR is 1,000 times more sensitive than conventional ELISA. it is 1,000 times more sensitive than conventional ELISA. NAT has already reached the ultimate goal in diagnostics of detecting 1 DNA/RNA molecule if present in the reaction tube. this may include increased multiplexing capabilities and total lab automation. for small- and medium-sized blood banks, small bench-top devices with high flexibility and broad range of assays would be preferable. plasma fractionators were the first to introduce NAT testing of their production pools to make, in conjunction with pathogen inactivation, blood products as safe as possible. it took years until the industry developed commercial test kits that were suitable for blood screening and that covered sufficiently broad range of transfusion-relevant viruses."}
