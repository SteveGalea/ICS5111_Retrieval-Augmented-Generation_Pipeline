{"summary": "many virulent and pathogenic organisms can be used individually or together as weapons. this use could cause high rates of morbidity and mortality among the population but also significant societal disruption and cost. a suspected bioterrorist attack, rapid diagnosis is critical for effective public health responses. large multiplex PCR assays have the advantage of detecting many pathogens from the same clinical sample in only a few hours while being highly sensitive and specific. the bioT DNA multiplex PCR-enzyme hybridization assay (BioT DNA mPCR-EHA) was developed for simultaneous detection of: VM, BA, YP, and FT. the LOD of genomic DNA for Variola major was at 1101 copies/mL for BA pX01 and FT, 1102 copies/mL for BA pX02 and 1100 copies/mL for YP. the analytical sensitivity for FT, YP and VM were 1103, 2.5102 and 5102 copies/mL. le Virus Copies/mL Copies/rxn Concentration Copies/rxn Ebola 1 106 1500 1 103 1.5 1 105 copies/mL 1200 RVF 1 106 1500 1 103 1.5 1 106 copies/mL 12000 Lassa 1 105 150 1 103 1.5 1 105 copies/mL 1200 Hanta SN 1 104 15 1 103 1.5 1 105 copies/mL 1200 Dengue 1 1 104 LD50/ specificity of bioT DNA and BioT RNA assays was tested against different pathogens. the organism, dilution and the result of the specificity testing for bioT DNA multiplex assay. pneumoniae Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Mycoplasma pneumoniae 103dilution Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Respiratory syncytial virus A 103 TCID50/mL Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Bacillus anthracis 104dilution >3.0 Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Yersinia pestis 104dilution Neg Neg Neg >3.0 Neg Neg Varicella-Zoster virus 103 TCID50/mL 71 103TCID50 /mL Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Neg Detection control 3.502 3.980 2.454 3.954 3.903 3.876 4.000 Neg = negative. swabs, 45 skin swabs, 15 serum, 7 sputum, 1 tracheal were tested with the DNA assay. the results were shown in Table 4A.

The sensitivity and specificity of BioT DNA and BioT RNA assays in spiked clinical specimens. surrogate clinical tests were shown in Table 4A. the results were shown in Table 4A. one sample tested very low positive for VM (OD=0.434) in the BA pX01 spiked samples. re-probing of the PCR product continued to show the sample to be positive. therefore, this represented a true false positive (1/400 samples) Varicella zoster virus while not a category \u201cA\u201d agent was chosen as a target for the bioT DNA assay in order to positively identify a possible cause of rash or lesions. it is presumed virtually all of the patients coming in to a hospital emergency room with a concern for VM will not actually have this virus. positive signals for both primers and probe sets will be considered 'positive' for BA. pX01 and pX02 primers demonstrated excellent LOD (1\u201310 input copies for all analytes) and no significant cross reactivity with large number of agents that might be in clinical samples. real-time PCR and microarray are currently two of the most commonly reported molecular diagnostic methods. real-time PCR and microarray are currently two of the most commonly reported molecular diagnostic methods. two commercial triplex (multiplex) real time PCR kits and machines were developed by cepheid [13] and Idaho Technology, Inc. possible advantages over published methods include increased number of analytes per test (5 vs. 1 or 3), stability of reagents, use of common technology and cost. real-time reagents have shorter shelf lives than our HRP labeled reagents because of their use of fluorescent probes. our laboratory is to develop fully contained, automated hands-off devices that can extract nucleic acid, amplify a target, and detect it while being fast, accurate and inexpensive. this technology must be robust and flexible to different targets and matrix material (transport medium and clinical material) Yersinia pestis YP-1F VA 195 bp

for pathogenicity. synthetic RNA standards were generated from linearized target sequence plasmids. the quantity of DNA and RNA transcripts were measured by the absorbance at 260 nm and the purity of the DNA or RNA by the ratio at A260/280. cDNA was synthesized in a 20 uL reaction mixture containing 2.5 mM random hexamers (Applied Biosystems), 4 mM dNTPs (Applied Biosystems), 4mM MgCl2 (Applied Biosystems), 1U/L RNase inhibitor, 2.5U/L MuLv reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems) and 3 l RNA. a total of 65 L of 10 nM horseradish peroxid the plate was washed 10 times with a 1X Wash Buffer. then 200 L of Tetramethyl benzidine substrate was added to each experimental well. the positive cut off value was chosen to be four times greater than the value of the negative control. the RNA and plasmid controls diluted in water were used as a template in RT-PCR to determine the limit of detection without extraction. the RNA controls diluted in water were used as a template in RT-PCR to determine the limit of detection (LOD) without extraction. 264 clinical samples (196 NP swabs, 45 skin swabs, 15 serum, 7 sputum, 1 tracheal) were collected from 264 subjects. of the 264 subjects, 130 presented with respiratory symptoms and 134 presented without respiratory symptoms. 139 were females and 125 were males for the RNA assay. the recombinant positive controls of FT and BA pX01 were spiked into NP swab specimens at the concentration 1104 copies/mL. the recombinant positive control of VM was spiked into skin swab samples at the concentration 1104 copies/mL. organisms listed in

the L gene for the Lassa, the S segment for Hanta and the 3\u2032UTR for dengue. all four serotypes of dengue virus were obtained from ATCC. the RNA transcripts were diluted in RNase and DNase free water with RNase Inhibitor (Applied Biosystems), frozen at 80\u00b0C in 30 L aliquots. serial dilutions of the plasmids and RNA transcripts were used to establish the analytical sensitivity and specificity of bioT DNA and RNA multiplex assays. the reaction mixture was incubated for 5 min at 25\u00b0C and for 30 min at 42\u00b0C. then the transcriptase was inactivated at 95\u00b0C for 5 min. 10 L of cDNA were amplified by adding 39.5 L of a Multiplex Supermix. cDNA was synthesized in 20 uL reaction mixture containing 2.5 mM random hexamers (Applied Biosystems), 4 mM dNTPs (Applied

Supermix. the final concentration of primer is 250nM for each forward primer and 500nM for each reverse primer. PCR products from both DNA and RNA assays were purified using the QiaQuick PCR purification Kit (Qiagen) previously extracted from whole organisms and plasmid DNA controls were made (104 to 101 or 101 copies/mL) in M4 medium (Remel, Lenexa, KS), extracted using the high pure viral nucleic acid kit (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) the analytical sensitivity of the assay for dengue was determined using serial dilutions of all four serotypes of dengue virus. ATCC bacterial and viral strains tested by the DNA assay were diluted to 1103 CFU/mL, 1104 CFU/mL, 1103 TCID50 /mL or 1104 cells/mL respectively. plasmid DNA controls and whole virus were then tested at 1 to 2 log higher than the LOD using the same method. 302 samples were from subjects with respiratory symptoms and 247 from subjects with no respiratory symptoms. 258 were from females and 291 were from males. any sample with OD value between 0.300\u20130.399 was considered indeterminant and was reprobed to confirm the results. 20 serum samples were spiked with whole organism of each serotype of dengue virus (80 total) 6 serum samples were run as negative specimens with each serotype of dengue virus (24 total) dengue 1 and dengue 2 were spiked at 1102 dilution, the concentration of which was 2 logs higher than the LOD of dengue 1."}
