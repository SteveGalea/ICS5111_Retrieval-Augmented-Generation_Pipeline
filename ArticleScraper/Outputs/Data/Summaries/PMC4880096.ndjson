{"summary": "analysis of questionnaire indicators enabled systematic analysis of information unavailable from WHO sources. all countries that transitioned from capacity-building to the 5-year sustainability cooperative agreement and returned the completed questionnaire were included in our analysis. ating Centers for influenza receive influenza specimens or viral isolates from NICs to analyze for seasonal influenza vaccine strain selection (14,15) the change in the number of countries with NICs that shared specimens at the start of the program, compared with those sharing specimens in 2013. data were double entered and analyzed by using Epi Info version 7.1.2. data were double entered and analyzed by using Epi Info version 7.1.2. change in number of countries designated as WHO NICs. the 2013 retrospective questionnaire was available in English, French, and Spanish. it was piloted in 3 countries before implementation. the questionnaire was available in English, French, and Spanish. results Of 39 countries that partnered with CDC to improve influenza surveillance capabilities, 36 (92%) transitioned to CDC\u2019s 5-year sustainability cooperative agreement, and 35 (97%) completed the questionnaire. no respondent had 1 year of experience. of countries conducting routine virologic surveillance for influenza increased from 19 at the start of the capacity-strengthening program to 35 in 2013. the total annual number of specimens tested increased substantially, from 81,851 at the start of the program to 542,235 in 2013. most growth occurred during the year after the pH1N1 pandemic. EQAP panels increased from 36% (4/11) in 2007 to 85% (30/34) in 2013. the median percentage of weeks reported per year increased from a baseline of 21% (IQR 0%\u201398%) to 100% (IQR 79%\u2013100%) after 5 years of support. 35 countries used CDC program support to strengthen their ability to report national virologic data to WHO fluNet on a weekly basis, by rank order*. a total of 39 countries partnered with CDC for influenza surveillance capacity strengthening during different years. countries with sentinel sites capable of collecting specimens 1 time per week from patients screened for ILI or SARI in WHO regions*. 39 countries partnered with CDC for influenza surveillance capacity strengthening. 25 (97%) of the 26 believed capacity strengthening played a critical (n = 16) or major (n = 9) role in their pandemic response. 15 countries noted improvements to influenza laboratory diagnostics, which made possible identification of pH1N1 and influenza A(H5N1) viruses. 39 countries partnered with CDC for influenza surveillance capacity strengthening during different years. 35 countries responded to a 2013 questionnaire and are included in our analysis. a total of 39 countries partnered with CDC for influenza surveillance capacity strengthening during different years. the measure was completed before or during the 10-year CDC capability-strengthening program. specimens tested increased from 81,851 (median 37, IQR 0\u20132,411) at the start of the program to 542,235 (median 2,826, IQR 1,282\u20135,052) in 2013. most growth occurred during the year after the pH1N1 pandemic. of 19 countries with no NIC at the start of the program, 12 (63%) fulfilled the required criteria and received official NIC designation. the median percentage of weeks reported per year increased from a baseline of 21% (IQR 0%\u201398%) to 100% (IQR 79%\u2013100%) after 5 years of support, when all countries transitioned to the sustainability cooperative agreement. a total of 39 countries responded to a 2013 questionnaire and are included in our analysis. 39 countries partnered with CDC for influenza surveillance capacity strengthening. 35 countries responded to a 2013 questionnaire and are included in this analysis. 39 countries partnered with CDC for influenza surveillance capacity strengthening during different years. 35 countries responded to a 2013 questionnaire and are included in our analysis. the most common was establishment of routine sentinel SARI or ILI surveillance systems. 15 countries noted improvements to influenza laboratory diagnostics. other key capacities described were ability to understand seasonal trends. 39 countries partnered with CDC for influenza surveillance capacity strengthening during different years. 35 countries responded to a 2013 questionnaire and are included in our analysis. 35 countries responded to a 2013 questionnaire and are included in our analysis. the measure was completed before or during the 10-year CDC capability-strengthening program. 34 countries reported that they were mostly or very able to meet their countries\u2019 needs through the program. the increase in influenza testing since the start of the program may be driven in part by the growth in ILI and SARI sentinel sites that collect weekly samples. in the united states, the Influenza Virologic Surveillance Right Size Project was launched in 2010 to help determine the optimal amount of surveillance needed. the increase in the number of countries submitting specimens for seasonal vaccine strain selection is critical for selecting the most representative strains currently circulating. the recent emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in Saudi Arabia (24) and the devastating outbreak of Ebola in West Africa (25) have tested the flexibility of existing surveillance platforms. 32 (91%) countries felt ownership of capacity-strengthening offers encouraging evidence for the program\u2019s approach. the perception of increased effects of funding on laboratory strengthening is unsurprising. some responding countries perceived training and technical advice from experts, objective assessments of capacity, and the ability to share experience as having even greater effects than funding. progress has been made in laboratory and sentinel surveillance capacities. countries are translating these capabilities into better decision making."}
