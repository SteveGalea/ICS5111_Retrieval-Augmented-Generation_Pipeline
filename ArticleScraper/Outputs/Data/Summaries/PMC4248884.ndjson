{"summary": "Until 2012, five human coronaviruses (HCoVs) were known. the first two human coronaviruses, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, were discovered in the mid-1960s as the causative agents of mild respiratory infections. in 2003, a new human coronavirus was identified as the causative agent of the first global pandemic of the new millennium. so far, there have been 837 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection in 20 countries. the first case in the united states, in Indiana, reported in 2 May 2014. the complete genome sequence has been obtained, animal models are being developed, and phylogenic, evolutionary, receptor interaction, and tissue tropism analyses are now becoming available. human-to-human transmission has been reported, with a higher prevalence in immunocompromised patients or patients with underlying diseases. the host immune response to viral infection has been linked directly to MERS-CoV outcomes in patients (25). coronaviruses encode proteins that can actively antagonize cellular signaling pathways associated with the host establishment of an antiviral state. the PLpro domain from MERS-CoV exhibits both DUB and deISGylating activities in host cells. these activities block the production of IFN- in transfected cells (42). Similarly, Yang et al. showed that MERS-CoV PLpro blocks the signaling pathway that leads to the activation of IFN- regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) (41). transfections were performed with 70% confluent cells in cell culture plates (Corning) for BHK-21 cells, using Lipofectamine 2000, and in cell bind plates (Corning) for HEK293T cells, using TransIT-LT1 reagent (Mirus) according to manufacturer's protocols. pEF-BOS MDA5 (Addgene) expression plasmid was a gift from Kate Fitzgerald (University of Massachusetts Medical School) the epitope-tagged constructs for the DUB and deISGylation assays, including pcDNA3.1-Flag-Ub (provided by Adriano Marchese), pcDNA3-myc6-mISG15 (a gift from Min-Jung Kim, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang the membrane was blocked using 5% dried skim milk in TBST buffer. the membrane was washed 3 times for 10 min in TBST buffer. the membrane was then incubated with mouse anti-mouse\u2013horseradish peroxidase (HRP) antibody. firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using a passive lysis buffer (Promega) results were normalized to the Renilla luciferase expression control. Approximately 29 g of cells were harvested by centrifugation. resuspended cells were lysed on ice via sonication. lysate was loaded at 2 ml/min onto 5-ml hisTrap FF column. MERS-CoV PLpro was eluted with a linear gradient of 0% to 60% buffer D (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM ME, and 10% glycerol) the PLpro catalytic domain of nsp3 from SARS-CoV was expressed and purified according to our previously published methods (28). leos MALS instrument (Wyatt Technology) and an Optilab rEX instrument (Wyatt Technology) were used to determine the weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of oligomers and protein complexes. the number-average molecular weight (Mn) was also determined to calculate the polydispersity index (Mw/Mn) of each peak. concentrations after complete hydrolysis of the peptide substrates by PLpro were carried out in triplicate. the reactions were initiated by the addition of PLpro to assay buffer. the reactions were initiated by the addition of 140 nM SARS-CoV PLpro. the associated error in kcat/KM values was calculated from the following equation; (kcat/KM) = (kcat/KM)[(kcat/kcat)2 + (KM/KM)2]1/2. when the response of PLpro catalytic activity was linear over the substrate concentration range investigated, the apparent kcat/KM values were determined by fitting the initial velocity data as function of substrate concentration. a total of 20 nM enzyme was incubated at room temperature with 12 g of different ubiquitin chain substrates, including K48-linked Ub(4), K48-linked Ub(5), K63-linked Ub(6), and linear Ub(4). a total of 20 nM enzyme was incubated at room temperature with 12 g of different ubiquitin chain substrates. products were performed on a NuPAGE Bis-Tris gel (Life Technologies) each gel was then visualized using a proteinSimple FluorChem E system. each substrate was then photographed using a proteinSimple FluorChem E system. pcDNA-MERS-PLpro (designated N20, N40, and N60 respectively) with an in-frame C-terminal V5 tag were generated by PCR amplification from pcDNA-MERS-PLpro. we used a forward primer (N20-Fwd, AGTGAATTCACCATGGATACTTATCGGTCTC; or N60-Fwd, AGTGAATTCACCATGGATGAGACGAG) and the reverse primer c5 expressing the E1, E2, and E3 ISG15-conjugating enzymes were used. for deISGylation assay, HEK293T cells in 24-well plates were cotransfected with 200 ng of pISG15-myc, 250 ng pISG15-myc, 125 ng pUbcH8, 125 ng pUbe1L, and 125 ng pHerc5. ish peroxidase (HRP) antibody at a dilution of 1:10,000 (Amersham) for 1 h at ambient temperature. membrane probed with mouse anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen) at a dilution of 1:5,000. the gene was inserted into bio Basic's standard vector pUC57. the PCR amplicon was then inserted into the pEV-L8 vector. the resulting plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). the clarified lysate was loaded at 2 ml/min onto a 5-ml HisTrap FF column (GE Healthcare) precharged with Ni2+. unbound proteins were washed with 5 column volumes of buffer A. the PLpro catalytic domain of nsp3 from SARS-CoV was expressed and purified according to our previously described methods. the PLpro catalytic domain of nsp3 from SARS-CoV was expressed and purified. the rates of hydrolysis of a peptide substrate, Z-RLRGG-AMC (Bachem), were determined by monitoring the increase in fluorescence of the 5-aminomethyl coumarin (AMC) group released. the reactions were initiated by the addition of 140 nM SARS-CoV PLpro or 1.6 M MERS-CoV PLpro. the reaction mixtures were made in half-area, 96-well black microplates from corning. the reactions were initiated with enzymes to yield final concentrations of 32 nM for SARS-CoV PLpro and 80 nM for MERS-CoV PLpro. 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 150 mM NaCl, and 2.5 mM DTT at 25\u00b0C. inhibition assays and IC50 (Ki value) determination. final enzyme concentrations were 32 nM for SARS-CoV PLpro and 80 nM for MERS-CoV PLpro. the ability of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV PLpros to process polyubiquitin chains was determined using assay mixtures containing 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.01 mg/ml BSA, 100 mM NaCl, and 2 mM DTT. a total of 20 nM enzyme was incubated at room temperature with 12 g of different ubiquitin chain substrates, including K48-linked Ub(4), K48 plasmid for a region of nsp3 (residues 1485 to 1802) produced an active form of PLpro. this expression construct contains both the PLpro catalytic and UBL domains. we truncated the N terminus by 20, 40, and 60 amino acids within the UBL domain. pro catalytic cysteine 1594 mutant (CA) was unable to process the substrate. these results strongly suggest that the UBL domain of MERS-CoV PLpro is not required for proteolytic processing. the strong bands indicate ISGylated (C) and ubiquitinated (D) proteins. we then tested whether the UBL domain was required for deubiquitination and deISGylation of host cell proteins in cell culture. the role of the UBL domain in interferon antagonism is controversial. however, the role of the UBL domain in interferon antagonism is controversial. we investigated whether MERS-CoV PLpro without its UBL domain can inhibit MDA5-mediated induction of IFN-. fected with plasmids expressing IFN-luciferase, Renilla luciferase, and stimulator MDA5. at 16 h posttransfection, cells were lysed and luciferase activity was measured. results of the UBL deletion analysis of MERS-CoV PLpro suggested that we could potentially express and purify a version of MERS-CoV PLpro without its UBL domain. a total yield of 20 mg per liter of cell culture can be obtained by this method. a total yield of 20 mg per liter of cell culture can be obtained. we used size-exclusion chromatography coupled with multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS) to determine the oligomeric state of MERS-CoV PLpro. each sample eluted at the same retention time. the calculated molecular mass was 38.4 3.3 kDa for each peak. the assays with Z-RLRGG-AMC were performed at substrate concentrations of no higher than 50 M. the kinetic responses of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV PLpro to increasing concentrations of the 3 substrates are shown in Fig. 4A. data were fit to the equation v/[E] = kcat/KM[S], where [E] and [S] are the concentrations of enzyme and substrate, respectively. error bars represent the standard deviations for a minimum of triplicate samples. the responses of the PLpro enzymes from both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV to increasing concentrations of the substrate Ub-AMC were hyperbolic over a concentration range of 0.03 M to 16 M. therefore, the kinetic responses of both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV PLpro to increasing concentrations of the substrate Ub-AMC were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation to derive the Vmax and KM values. SARS-CoV PLpro catalyzes the turnover of the Ub-AMC and ISG15-AMC substrates approximately 4-fold (75.9 min1 versus 18.8 min1) and 14-fold (436 min1 versus 32.6 min1) faster than MERS-CoV PLpro does. the differences for the Z-RLRGG-AMC and ISG15-AMC substrates cannot be ascribed to either kcat or KM. the higher activity of SARS-CoV PLpro for ISG15-AMC stems from the more significant differences in the kcat values (436 min1 for SARS-CoV PLpro versus 32.6 min1 for MERS-CoV PLpro) the affinity of free Ub for MERS-CoV PLpro is substantially higher than that for SARS-CoV PLpro (IC50 = 18.4 12.2 M) the differences in IC50s suggest that MERS-CoV PLpro binds Ub significantly more tightly than SARS-CoV PLpro does. MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV PLpros, at a concentration of 1.6 nM, were first incubated overnight with 1 g each of the Ub-based substrates: K48-linked Ub(5), K63-linked Ub(6), and linear Met1-Ub(4). the low activity of MERS-CoV PLpro was the first indication that the enzyme has poorer catalytic activity toward polyubiquitin chains than that of the SARS-Co in vitro cleavage of K48-linked Ub(5) (A) and Ub(4) (D) by MERS-CoV PLpro and SARS-CoV PLpro, respectively, and of K63-linked Ub(6) by MERS-CoV PLpro (B) and SARS-CoV PLpro (E) is shown. processing of the substrates is shown by the production of lower-molecular-weight bands at progressive time points, in minutes (\u2032) or cleavage of K48-linked polyubiquitin chains resulted in an increase of mono-Ub. cleavage of K48-linked Ub(5) produced Ub(4), Ub(3), Ub(2), and mono-Ub over time. however, recognition of polyubiquitin chains by MERS-CoV PLpro occurs primarily through a bivalent recognition mechanism. the inhibitory activity of 28 compounds was tested against MERS-CoV PLpro, SARS-CoV PLpro, and HCoV-NL63 PLP2. the results suggest a low level of sequence conservation may exist between inhibitor-binding sites that is not necessarily related to the coronavirus group specification. the percent inhibition of SARS-CoV PLpro, HCoV-NL63 PLP2 and MERS-CoV PLpro activity in the presence of SARS-CoV PLpro inhibitors is shown by a graph. the difference between each independent measurement was less than 10% for the entire set of data. highlights include the best SARS-CoV PLpro inhibitor candidates. the homology model was then compared to the recently reported X-ray crystal structure of unliganded MERS-CoV PLpro (61). the structures were found to be very similar, with the exception of the active site loop, which is missing in the X-ray structure. amino acids involved in SARS-CoV PLpro\u2013Ub C terminus interactions are shown in blue font. the predicted corresponding amino acids in MERS-CoV PLpro are shown in black font. residues highlighted in bold are the nonconserved amino acids in MERS-CoV PLpro. oV-NL63 PLP2, aa 1 corresponds to amino acid 1480 in the polyprotein. for MERS-CoV PLpro, amino acid 1 corresponds to amino acid 1480 in the polyprotein. a structural superposition between the refined homology model of MERS-CoV PLpro (yellow cartoon) and the recently reported X-ray crystal structure yields a C- root mean square deviation (RMSD) value. only 8 of 12 hydrogen bonds (H bonds) are likely to be conserved in the MERS-CoV PLpro\u2013Ub C terminus interactions. loss of 4 H bonds is due to nonconserved changes of E168, Y265, and W107 from SARS-CoV PLpro to R170, F271, and L108, respectively, in MERS-CoV PLpro. amino acid differences occur within the hydrophobic pocket comprising P248-P249 and at the flexible -turn/loop (BL2 loop or Gly267-Gly272) known to participate in an induced-fit mechanism of inhibitor association. more conserved substitutions are predicted for HCoV-NL63 PLP2. the presence of a smaller amino acid residue in the oxyanion hole of HCoV-NL63 PLP2 could render a larger cavity at the S\u2032 subsites of the enzyme. we have shown that MERS-CoV PLpro does not share SARS-CoV PLpro substrate specificity at the SUb2 site for distal Ub molecules. a longer helix 2 (56) may exist at the SUb2 site. expression construct contains both the PLpro catalytic and UBL domains (also known as the UB2 domain [53] of MERS-CoV nsp3, with the addition of 2 amino acids at the N terminus (methionine and alanine) to allow efficient translation, and a V5 epitope tag on the C terminus, for V5 antibody detection. HEK293T cells were transfected with each of the UBL-deleted mutants, HEK293T cells were transfected with a c-myc-ISG15, E1, E2, and E3 ISGylating machinery plasmids to test the deubiquitinating (D) activity of each PLpro construct. the strong bands indicate ISGylated (C) and ubiquitinated (D) proteins. we harvested cell lysates at 18 h posttransfection to evaluate the presence of ISGylated proteins. we found that both WT PLpro and UBL-deleted mutants deconjugated ISG15 from multiple cellular substrates. the catalytic cysteine was required for the deconjugation of ISG15. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing IFN--luciferase, Renilla luciferase, pEF-BOS-MDA5 and either the MERS-CoV PLpro WT or catalytic mutant protein. at 16 h posttransfection, cells were lysed and luciferase activity was measured. PLpro suggested that we could express and purify a version of MERS-CoV PLpro without its UBL domain. however, we previously attempted to express and purify a version of SARS-CoV PLpro without its UBL domain. however, we found it to be unstable during purification, as it lost catalytic activity over time. SDS-PAGE analysis of whole-cell lysate and purified MERS-CoV PLpro at different protein concentrations. MERS-CoV PLpro at 4.2 mg/ml, 2.1 mg/ml, and 1.0 mg/ml eluted at same retention time from a SEC column. 3.3 kDa is consistent with both the apparent molecular mass (37 kDa) on SDS-PAGE and the expected molecular mass for a monomer (38.1 kDa) the results indicate that MERS-CoV PLpro exists almost exclusively as a monomer in solution, with no detectable higher-order oligomers or aggregates. the activity of MERS-CoV PLpro with the peptide substrate Z-RLRGG-AMC was significantly lower (100-fold) than that of SARS-CoV PLpro. this result suggests significant differences between the enzyme's active sites in terms of recognition and catalysis of the peptide substrate. MERS-CoV PLpro kcat/KM (M1 min1) 0.003 0.0001a 1.3 0.2 9.9 1.6 kcat (min1) 18.8 1.2 32.6 1.8 KM (M) 14.3 2.0 3.3 0.5 IC50 (M)b 21.3 4.0 54.4 17.7 SARS-CoV PLpro kcat/KM (M1 min1) 0.3 0.1a 1.5 0.3 29 5.3 kcat (min1) 75.9 over a concentration range of 0.08 M to 25 M, SARS-CoV PLpro exhibited a curvilinear response to increasing concentrations of Ub-AMC. the downward curvature becomes apparent after a concentration of 5 M, suggesting that the response of SARS-CoV PLpro to Ub-AMC follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics but that the enzyme is still undersaturated at a concentration of 25 M. MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV PLpros are equally efficient in hydrolyzing the ISG15-AMC substrate (kcat/KM = 29 M1 min1 versus 9.9 M1 min1) however, their kcat/KM values are each about 1.3 M1 min1 due to an 4-fold equivalent difference between the KM and kcat values between each enzyme. higher activity of SARS-CoV PLpro for ISG15-AMC stems from the more significant differences in the kcat values (436 min1 for SARS-CoV PLpro versus 32.6 min1 for MERS-CoV PLpro) if one assumes that the KM values reflect the relative affinities of the enzymes for the substrate, i.e., KM = Kd (dissociation constant), then both ISG15-AMC and Ub differences in IC50s suggest that MERS-CoV PLpro binds Ub significantly more tightly than SARS-CoV PLpro does and that SARS-CoV PLpro binds ISG15 more tightly than MERS-CoV PLpro does. recent X-ray structural and kinetic studies have revealed the complexity behind SARS-CoV PLpro substrate specificity toward polyubiquitin and ISG15 substrates. the low activity of MERS-CoV PLpro was the first indication that the enzyme has poorer catalytic activity toward polyubiquitin chains than that of the SARS-CoV PLpro enzyme. in order to detect any patterns in the products cleaved by MERS-CoV PLpro, the PLpro enzyme concentration was increased to 5 nM. after 18 h, the reactions were almost complete. processing of the substrates is shown by the production of lower-molecular-weight bands at progressive time points, in minutes (\u2032) or hours (h). the locations of the different Ub species are shown. Lane M, molecular size marker. inhibitors of SARS-CoV PLpro and HCoV-NL63 PLP2 do not inhibit MERS-CoV. these newer inhibitors have improved inhibitory potency and antiviral activity. none of the compounds show off-target inhibitory activity toward a number of human DUB enzymes or cysteine proteases. no significant inhibition of HCoV-NL63 PLP2 was observed for any of the compounds at a concentration of 100 M. HCoV-NL63 PLP2 is from the more distantly related group 1 coronaviruses and shares only about 30% homology with SARS-CoV PLpro. a low level of sequence conservation may exist between inhibitor-binding sites that is not necessarily related to the coronavirus group specification. homology model of MERS-CoV PLpro was analyzed by overlaying it with the structures of SARS-CoV PLpro in complex with Ub and the inhibitor 3k (28). the domains of SARS-CoV PLpro and MERS-CoV PLpro share 52% overall homology. homology model of the active site loop continues with the homology model. we indicate any major differences with the X-ray structure, which were few in the structural regions of interest. ridge region of the thumb domain is positioned onto the Ub-binding domain. the amino acid residues important for SARS-CoV PLpro\u2013inhibitor interactions are shown (blue font), along with the predicted corresponding amino acids in HCoV-NL63 PLP2 and MERS-CoV PLpro (black font). the residues highlighted in bold are the nonconserved substitutions in MERS-CoV PLpro. the 2Fo Fc electron density map from PDB entry 4P16 is contoured at 1. the residues comprising the -turn in the 4P16 structure are missing in the X-ray structure due to the lack of associated electron density. the refined homology model contains this loop region and therefore serves as a useful structural model for understanding the interactions between the loop and substrates or inhibitors. kinetic studies showed that SARS-CoV PLpro is 100-fold more active than MERS-CoV PLpro with the peptide substrate Z-RLRGG-AMC (Table 2). therefore, unlike SARS-CoV PLpro, greater binding energy is likely provided by interactions outside the Ub C-terminal RLRGG residues. other potential amino acid differences within the enzyme subsites may also explain the lack of inhibition by compounds designed to be inhibitors. oxyanion hole of HCoV-NL63 PLP2 is occupied by the small amino acid T96. the presence of a smaller amino acid residue in the oxyanion hole of HCoV-NL63 PLP2 could render a larger cavity at the S\u2032 subsites. coV PLpro substrate specificity at the ridge region of the thumb domain. a longer helix 2 (56) may exist at the SUb2 site. the model suggests that a longer helix 2 (56) may exist at the site. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV encode only one PLpro domain within nsp3. this is an ortholog to the PLP2 domain from other CoVs encoding two PLpro domains. recent studies on the substrate specificities of SARS-CoV PLpro demonstrate the uniqueness of SARS-CoV PLpro among other CoV PLpros studied so far in terms of recognizing and processing ubiquitin chains. the activity of MERS-CoV PLpro toward the Z-RLRGG-AMC substrate is 100-fold lower than that with SARS-CoV PLpro. the activity of MERS-CoV PLpro toward the Z-RLRGG-AMC substrate is 100-fold lower than that with SARS-CoV PLpro. this suggests that the enzymes differ in substrate recognition at the subsites. a comparison of the amino acids within the -turn/loop indicates little to no conservation. HCoV-NL63 PLP2 has the same number of residues within the -turn/loop. phenylalanine (F255) in a position equivalent to that of the tyrosine residue (Y269) in SARS-CoV PLpro. the structural elements were generated using the X-ray crystal structure of SARS-CoV apo-PLpro (PDB entry 2FE8). -Helix 2 (highlighted with a green box), containing the amino acid residues important for interactions with SARS-CoV PLpro inhibitors is highly divergent among CoV PLpros. TGEV-CoV PLP21487\u20131783, CAA83979.1; FCoV PLP21441\u20131920, AFX81090; BCoV PLP221562\u20131870, NP_150073; and MHV-A59 PLP21606\u20131915, NP_068668.2. the great topological diversity postulated by 8 different types of polyubiquitin chains provides additional regulatory elements of Ub recognition by DUB enzymes MERS-CoV PLpro loses its ability to rapidly cleave K48-linked polyubiquitin chains over time. this phenomenon stems from the fact that SARS-CoV PLpro prefers to bind K48-linked di-Ub molecule chains via a bivalent interaction with the enzyme's zinc finger domain and the ridge region of the thumb domain. these two distal Ub/UBL subsites are capable of interacting simultaneously with K48-linked di- diagrams show two mechanisms for the recognition of the distal Ub (B and C) from K48-linked Ub(4) (A) the distal Ub-interacting subsites SUb1 and SUb2 are shown for a bivalent mode of recognition. analysis of amino acid sequence conservation shows very little conservation. bivalent recognition of K48-linked Ub(2) may be a unique feature of SARS-CoV PLpro. but more research is required to understand the potential implications of different polyubiquitin recognition patterns during the PLpro-mediated antagonism of the innate immune response. mono-Ub is a slow step in the kinetic mechanism of K48-polyubiquitin chain processing. processing occurs stepwise, with equal opportunities for endo- and exo-trimming of the chain. cleavage site for linear ubiquitin would be R-L-R-G-G|M-Q-I-F-V. PLpros from MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV do not have specificity for linear polyubiquitin chains. both enzymes are capable of cleaving and hydrolyzing fluorophores from the C termini of RLRGG peptide, Ub, and ISG15 substrates. but both enzymes are capable of cleaving and cleaving K48-linked and K63-linked polyubiquitin chains. using structure-guided mutagenesis, we diminished the ability of SARS-CoV PLpro to preferentially bind di-Ub and ISG15 over mono-Ub. these results suggest subtle differences in polyubiquitin chain cleavage specificity may have functional ramifications for viral pathogenesis."}
