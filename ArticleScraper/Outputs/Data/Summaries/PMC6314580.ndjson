{"summary": "glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is an X-linked inheritance. gene consists of 13 exons with approximately 18kb and is situated on the distal long arm of X chromosome (Xq28) 9.8% of males and 21.0% of females possess the G6PD mutation. in Myanmar, the prevalence is 11.1% and 4.2% in adult males and females respectively [11], while it is 15.0% and 2.1% in healthy children males and females respectively [12]. dengue is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in children living in tropical and sub-tropical regions. patients with a positive NS1 antigen and/or dengue IgM result were enrolled. complete blood count (CBC), reticulocyte count (RC) and G6PD activity were measured within 24 hours after collection of acute sera. both acute and convalescent samples were stored at -80\u00b0C. clinical trials Registry (TCTR) website, number # TCTR20180720001. The data that support the findings are available in protocols.io with the https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io. G6PD activity Sample was stored at 4\u20138\u00b0C. then transported to laboratory in Yangon Myanmar and processed within 24 hours. normal and deficient controls were used. genetyping PCR was performed using 25 L reactions containing 12.5 L of iQ Multiplex Power Mix, 0.75 L each of forward and reverse primers, 0.5 l each of SNP and WT probes, 9 L sterile distilled water, and 1 L genomic DNA. fluorescence and Ct values using the CFX Manager software were used to determine genotypes. warning signs included abdominal pain or tenderness, persistent vomiting, clinical fluid accumulation, mucosal bleed, lethargy/restlessness, liver enlargement > 2cm and increase in haematocrit (44%) concurrent with rapid decrease in platelet count (100 103 per l) data were analysed using IBM SPSS statistics software package. paediatric patients with a fever for 1\u20137 days were screened. written informed consent and verbal assent were taken from caregivers and children. the protocol was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of the Department of Medical Research, Myanmar (approval number 64/Ethics 2015) and the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Thailand (approval number was 2016-0808-01). the study was also registered following the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO-ICTRP) on Thai Clinical Trials Registry (TCTR) website, number # TCTR20180720001. The data that support the findings are available in protocols.i assays were performed according to manufacturer\u2019s protocol. a positive control provided from the kit; negative control (healthy donor sera); and no template control were included. a positive PCR was defined as when one or both duplicates had a signal above a fixed threshold of 200 for all the respective targets. three G6PD variants previously reported in G6PD-deficient individuals in Myanmar were detected by real-time PCR with the BIO-RAD CFX 96 Real-Time System and C1000 Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad, USA) the samples were run together with the plasmid control for each targeted mutation. dengue, zika and chikungunya virus detection using reverse transcriptase PCR assay RNA was isolated from acute patient serum samples (140 L) using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany) RNA extractions were performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. no PD 2617 for deficient and Cat no PD 2618 for normal, Randox Laboratories Ltd., Crumlin, UK) were used. the results were considered valid if the measured activities of the controls were within the reference range. the samples were run together with the plasmid control for each targeted mutation. each sample\u2019s result was verified by examining the PCR curve generated to eliminate false-positive results due to aberrant light emission. class I-V are defined as: class I 1% (associated with chronic non-spherocytic haemolytic anaemia), class II 1- 10%, class III 10-60%, class IV 60\u2013150%, and class V > 150%. the adjusted median enzyme activity in males was determined as 100% activity of the study population. in this study, G6PD deficiency was classified as severe, moderate, or normal if enzyme activity was 10%, 10\u201360%, or > 60%, respectively. the adjusted median enzyme activity in males was determined as 100% activity of the study population [22]. 196 patients with laboratory confirmed acute dengue infection included in study. 51 (26.0%) were classified as severe dengue while 145 (74.0%) were non-severe dengue. 115 (79.3%) presented with warning signs and 30 (20.7%) were without. severe dengue also had significantly higher haematocrit, higher leukocyte counts, and lower platelet counts than non-severe dengue patients. p-value Baseline Characteristics Male 23 (45.1) 80 (55.2) 0.215 Age (year),median (IQR)* 6.3

in Myanmar, mahidol, Kaiping and Mediterranean was performed in 128 of 196 dengue-confirmed samples. 25/128 (19.5%) had recognised SNPs, (13/64 (20.3%) were males while 12/64 (18.8%) were females. twenty-four patients had the Mahidol mutation (96%), and one female (4%) had the Kaiping mutation. females with genotypic mutations have varying degrees of the G6PD deficient phenotype being classified as WHO class II to WHO class IV. females with genotypic mutations have varying degrees of the G6PD deficient phenotype being classified as WHO class II to WHO class IV. gene mutation absent

and severe dengue (p = 0.977) patients with severe dengue were significantly younger (p = 0.001) and were hospitalised for a longer time (p 0.001) compared to non-severe dengue patients. majority of

Class II (severe G6PD deficiency) females with genotypic mutations have varying degrees of the G6PD deficient phenotype being classified as WHO class II to WHO class IV. males with genotypic mutations have varying degrees of the G6PD deficient phenotype being classified as WHO class II to WHO class IV. the majority of children in the present study, 84.2%, had secondary dengue infection possibly due to the four dengue serotypes circulating in this endemic area, which leads to subsequent infections. the result of this study is consistent with a meta-analysis of 40 studies in Asia that described the association between severity of dengue infection and G6PD enzyme deficiency or G6PD mutation was detected. in this study, 17 out of 72 patients had G6PD deficiency in 89 male paediatric patients. two in vitro studies showed that human monocytes from G6PD-deficient individuals had higher replication of dengue virus serotype 2 [5, 6], and these studies suggested that the likelihood of severe dengue was likely to increase in G6PD-deficient individuals. the findings from our study did not support this hypothesis, but viral load was not assessed in our study. a significant association between G6PD mutation, in predominantly the Mahidol variant, and dengue infection was not found. the effect of other G6PD gene mutations on dengue infection cannot be excluded based on our current study. patients with severe dengue had significantly higher haematocrit and lower platelet count than those with non-severe dengue. findings reinforced the applicability of the warning signs outlined in the 2009 WHO guidelines to detect severe dengue infection in children in Myanmar. more research is needed to explore other factors related to dengue severity such as dengue virus viral load, dengue virus DEN serotypes and genotypes."}
