{"summary": "BACKGROUND In 1999 the Communicable Disease Prevention Law of Japan was completely revised into the \"New\" Infectious Disease Control Law. it reiterated the importance of surveillance and information dissemination and re-organized the surveillance system. the current surveillance system is described before and after the revision. culosis prevention law since 1951 and the AIDS Prevention Law since 1989. no. of reported cases Incidence rate* 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 Legally defined communicable diseases Cholera 92 90 306 40 89 61 0.90 Diphtheria 5 1 1 1 1 3 0.02 Dysentery 1,120 1,042 1,062 1,218 1,301 1,749 9.94 Meningococcal meningitis 7 6 3 4 5 6 0.04 Epidemic typhus 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 anthem subitum 35.73 36.76 35.02 34.69 35.66 34.92 35.46 Group A streptococcal pharyngitis 29.02 32.98 24.55 31.00 34.77 33.94 31.04 Hand, foot and mouth disease 38.15 22.59 65.04 10.17 30.98 52.06 36.50 Herpangina 29.87 36.94 32.61 40.03 36.25 32.62 34.72 Infect chlamydial infection 23.13 23.91 22.74 23.80 25.97 28.50 24.68 Genital herpes 9.65 9.82 9.44 10.15 9.81 9.43 9.72 Gonorrhea 11.28 10.48 11.06 13.04 14.19 16.36 12.73 Syphilis.... 1.46 1.46 Trichomoniasis 6.52 6.12 4.99 4.51 3.93 3.77 4.97 Sentinel hospital (monthly report) national epidemiological surveillance for infectious disease (NESID) was revised and incorporated as the national epidemiological surveillance for infectious disease (NESID) in combination with national notifiable diseases, effective and timely feedback of such information to the general public and those working in medical fields are proposed. the previous Category IV infectious diseases, except those included in the new Category IV, have been placed under the new category V. 0 0 0 0.00 (0.00) Category II (all cases to be notified promptly after diagnosis)* Acute poliomyelitis 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0.00 (0.01) Cholera 39 58 50 51 25 86 56 0.43 (0.90) Paratyphoid fever 30 20 22 35 44 88 20 0.30 (0.39) Shigellosis 620 843 844 699 473 594 553 5.24 Typhoid 27 50 57 57 69 77 90 0.52 Amebiasis 276 378 429 465 520 610 698 4.05 Acute encephalitis 12 166 188 0.48 Congenital rubella syndrome 0 1 1 1 1 10 2 0.02 Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease 92 108 133 147 118 175 152 1.09 Cryptosporidiosis 4 3 11 109 8 92 12 0.31 Giardiasis 42 no. of reported cases per sentinel, sentinel reporting disease, Japan, 1999-2005. no. of reported cases per sentinel Average* 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 Influenza sentinel. acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis 1.84 2.29 2.11 1.60 1.61 1.21 1.12 1.66 (5.63) Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis 40.65 65.40 62.30 54.53 48.51 44.02 45.78 53.42 (7.08) Sexually transmitted disease sentinel (monthly report) Condyloma acuminatum 3.73 5.08 5.68 6.22 6.80 7.17 7.30 6. 66 15.03 10.41 Sentinel hospital (monthly report) methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection 24.92 39.42 40.19 43.47 45.52 46.64 48.01 43.88 Multi-drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection 0.98 1.21 1.33 1.54 1.62 1.43 1.48 1.44 Penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae infection 4.78 9.46 11.47 13.19 13. 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.00 Hepatitis A 761 381 491 502 303 139 170 2.60 Hepatitis E 0 3 0 16 30 37 42 0.17 Herpes B virus infection 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.00 Japanese encephalitis 5 7 5 8 1 5 7 0.04 (0.05) Legionellosis 56 154 86 167 146 161 281 1.30 Lep incidence rate is per year per 1,000,000 population in 2000-2005. the rate in 1993-1998 is in parentheses DESCRIPTION OF CURRENT SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM Surveillance flow and function required at each level are shown in the Figure 1. data are compared with those under the old law. syphilis and AIDS data are obtained from the statistics based on the report on the Venereal Disease Prevention Law. cases with dysentery decreased under the new law, but dysentery in the old era included both disease entities caused by Shigella dysentery and entamoeba histolytica. the number of sentinels under the new law increased because of the change in selection criteria. from April to December, 1999, many sentinel reporting diseases increased in terms of the number of reports per sentinel. but several vaccine preventable diseases including measles, rubella and pertussis decreased dramatically in the last 7 years. a far greater number of reported cases in the sentinel system than in the mandatory system. incidence rates of 1993-1998 are calculated using 1995 census population and those of 1999-2005 are based on the 2002 population. annual case numbers per sentinel, and number of sentinels are compared for the two periods. most of the diseases have declining trends in the new law period compared with before.
