{"summary": "the farm managers reported outbreaks of diarrheal disease in sows and piglets. clinical signs were similar to those associated with PEDV infection. the death rate in piglets was lower than that typically observed with PEDV infection. all samples from farm 1 were positive for deltacoronavirus by the 2 RT-PCR assays for M and N genes. 99% nt identity with porcine coronavirus HKU15 (PorCoV HKU15)-155. porcine epidemic diarrhea virus detected by real-time reverse transcription PCR. 39 (92.9%) of the 42 samples were positive for classical US PEDV instead of a recently reported variant PEDV (7). none of the samples tested were positive for transmissible gastroenteritis virus.

PEDV, virus and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus; PRCV, porcine respiratory coronavirus; TGEV, transmissible gastroenteritis virus; SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome. surveillance should be conducted in other states to define distribution of the virus among the pig population. whole-genome sequence analysis should be performed for other strains from different locations to determine whether the virus was introduced into the united states by a single entry or by multiple entries."}
