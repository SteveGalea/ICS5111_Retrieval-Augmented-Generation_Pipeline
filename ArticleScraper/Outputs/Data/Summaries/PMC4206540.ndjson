{"summary": "autophagosomes are sequestered by double-membrane vesicles called autophagosomes. the autophagic mechanism is constitutive and generally occurs at a basal level in all cells. it is upregulated in response to extracellular or intracellular stress and pathogen infection. a mammalian ortholog of yeast Atg8 was originally characterized as a microtubule-associated protein20. it has been extensively studied as a part of the autophagy machinery. some recent studies have provided evidence for an autophagy-independent role of LC3 in cellular processes. autophagy-deficient neuronal cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts show increased viral replication and titers. viral replication complexes marked by JEV NS1 and the replicative intermediate dsRNA also contain markers of the ERAD tuning LC3-I. more than 75% of cells that were JEV-infected showed a punctate distribution of GFP-LC3 compared with 20% of mock-infected cells. there were 40 to 50 GFP-LC3 puncta per cell in JEV-infected and serum-starved cells compared with 10 in mock-infected cells. autophagosome accumulation was further validated by western blotting. western blots were done using LC3, JEV, NS5 and GAPDH antibodies. lysates were analyzed by western blotting with LC3, JEV, NS5 and GAPDH antibodies. qPCR was performed using gene-specific primers and total RNA from serum-starved, mock-, or JEV-infected Neuro2a cells. as a control, qPCR was performed for genes that did not show any deregulation. increased LC3-II accumulation was also observed in JEV-infected Vero cells. 5/ MEFs showed higher basal levels of LC3-I compared with WT MEFs. autophagy restricts JEV replication and influences viral yields. autophagy restricts JEV replication and influences viral yields. western blot showing levels of ATG5 in WT and atg5/ MEFs. WT and atg5/ MEFs were infected with JEV. this enhancement in JEV RNA levels was also observed in WT and atg5/ MEFs. increase in virus replication by Torin 1 is independent of autophagic induction. autophagosomes fuse with late endosomes and lysosomes to form autolysosomes. autophagy-deficient cells are highly susceptible to virus-induced cell death. autophagy-deficient cells are highly susceptible to virus-induced cell death. in mock-infected cells treated with bafilomycin A1 or pepstatin A, we observed accumulation of autophagosome cargo SQSTM1. by 48 h pi increased levels of SQSTM1 are seen in JEV-infected cells indicative of accumulation of misfolded proteins and a block in autophagosome maturation. autophagy operates as a survival pathway in JEV-infected cells. it is possible that autophagy operates as a survival pathway. this is similar to what is observed in case of influenza and chikungunya viruses. all 3 NS proteins showed significant overlap with dsRNA. atg5/ MEFs showed very well-defined, numerous vesicular structures that represent viral replication complexes. the Pearson coefficient of colocalization of NS1 and dsRNA ranged from 0.43 to 0.5. 1 structures are neither acidic nor late endosomal structures. we further checked the colocalization of NS1 with GFP-LC3. ectopically expressed GFP-LC3 does not. overexpression of HA-fused NS1 in neuro2a cells did not lead to its accumulation in LC3-positive structures. LC3 puncta in these cells represent LC3-I and not LC3-II. NS1-LC3 complexes showed a punctate distribution in both neurons. the presence of LC3-positive puncta and vesicular membranes in atg5/ MEFs demonstrates that LC3-I form is associated with NS1 containing replication complexes. the presence of LC3-positive puncta and vesicular membranes in atg5/ MEFs demonstrates that LC3-I form is associated with NS1 marking viral replication complexes. lysates from JEV treated Neuro2a cells revealed significant enrichment of virus nonstructural proteins. these fractions were clearly separated from the lighter autophagosomal/late endosomal fraction containing LC3-I and LAMP1 that floated to the top of the gradient (fraction 1). significant overlap was also observed between EDEM1 and dsRNA in neuro2a cells, WT and atg5/ MEFs. s were collected from top to bottom of the gradient and probed with antibodies against LC3, EDEM1, LAMP1, NS1, and NS5. EDEM1 localization in mock-infected cells was both ER as seen by colocalization with ectopically expressed Myc-GRP78 (Pearson coefficient 0.65), and as several discrete independent vesicles in the cytosol. LC3 downregulation was confirmed by western blotting with LC3B antibody (Fig. 8A; Fig. S10E) and by qRT-PCR with LC3A- and LC3B-specific primers (data not shown). LC3 levels resulted in nearly 70% decrease in JEV RNA accumulation. this decrease also manifested as reduced levels of JEV proteins. the mouse neuroblastoma cell line Neuro2a was transfected with LC3-I. it was set up for serum-starvation or JEV-infection. more than 75% of cells that were JEV-infected showed a punctate distribution of GFP-LC3. neuro2a cells transfected with GFP-LC3 were mock-infected (A), infected with JEV (MOI 5, 24 h) (B), or serum-starved for 12 h (C) cells were fixed and stained with JEV-E antibody (blue, middle panels) qPCR was performed using gene-specific primers and total RNA from serum-starved, mock-, or JEV-infected Neuro2a cells. increased LC3-II accumulation was also observed in NT-2 (pluripotent human testicular embryonal carcinoma), N18 and Neuro2a. atg5/ MEFs showed accumulation of LC3-I in response to serum-starvation and JEV infection. atg5/ MEFs showed higher basal levels of LC3-I compared with WT MEFs. autophagy restricts JEV replication and influences viral yields. autophagy restricts JEV replication and influences viral yields. titers in control nontargeting and Atg7 siRNA-transfected Neuro2a cells were observed consistently in cells infected across different multiplicities of infection (MOIs) this enhancement manifested in a significant increase (3.5-fold) in JEV titers in atg5/ MEFs. we further tested whether pharmacological induction of autophagy also gives a similar effect. we used a highly potent and selective MTOR inhibitor. in mock-infected cells, bafilomycin A1 and pepstatin A treatment led to rapid accumulation of LC3-II. this suggests that at 24 h post-infection lysosomal proteolysis was not completely blocked. by 48 h pi, no further accumulation of LC3-II could be observed in response to bafilomycin A1 and pepstatin A treatment. TG7-depleted neuro2a cells were infected with JEV at 48 h pi. percentage of cell death was analyzed at 24 and 48 h pi. neuro2a cells depleted of ATG7 showed greater cell death. this enhancement was consistently seen in cells infected across different MOI and at different time pi. a similar increase in the number of apoptotic and secondary necrotic cells (2-fold) was also seen in atg5/ MEFs compared with WT MEFs. dsRNA stained as discrete puncta in virus-infected Neuro2a cells. all 3 NS proteins showed significant overlap with dsRNA. dsRNA stained as discrete puncta in cells that represent sites of viral replication. overlap between endogenous LC3 and NS1 was detected very early during infection (10 to 12 h pi) and was maintained throughout the infectious cycle (48 h pi) NS1 was significantly concentrated in LC3-positive compartments, but not in LAMP1 and LysoTracker Red compartments. color merged images are shown in the third panels. bar graph shows extent of colocalization of JEV NS1 with LC3, LAMP1, LysoTracker Red and GFP-LC3-positive compartments. NS1-LC3 complexes showed a punctate distribution in Neuro2a cells. staining pattern was more defined and vesicular in MEFs. LC3-I form is associated with NS1 containing replication complexes. autophagosomes are associated with LC3-II and can be marked with LC3-II. NS1 and EDEM1 localize with EDEM1 containing membranes in neuro2a cells and MEFs. EDEM1 localization in mock-infected cells was both ER as seen by colocalization with ectopically expressed Myc-GRP78. EDEM1 showed enrichment in viral replication complexes and its overlap with ER was reduced as seen. JEV-envelope protein predominantly localizes to the ER in infected cells55,56. this suggests enrichment or mobilization of EDEM1 in replication complexes compared with mock-infected cells. however total levels of EDEM1 did not appear to vary significantly between mock and JEV-infected cells. LC3 is an essential host factor for JEV replication. neuro2a cells transfected with control nontargeting (NT) or Lc3 (Lc3a and Lc3b), Sel1l and Edem1 siRNA were lysed 48 h post-transfection. vesicle formation in infected cells can be driven by recognition of viral RNA by immune sensors, virus binding to receptors, expression of viral proteins that usually leads to the induction of UPR due to ER stress and/or production of ROS. two earlier studies have shown that JEV induces autophagy33,34 but have primarily implicated autophagy as a positive regulator of virus replication. some cells like neurons have reduced type I IFN-dependent innate responses and are heavily reliant on an alternative prosurvival pathway like autophagy. further studies need to be done to determine the relative contribution of interferon vs. autophagy in neuronal cells and fibroblasts. autophagy inhibits viral replication and reduces virus titers in neuronal cells. studies in influenza and chikungunya have shown that the ability of virus to induce apoptosis is increased in autophagy-deficient cells. increased levels of LC3-I in these cells confer a replication advantage to the virus. a process known as ERAD tuning involves selective sorting of EDEM1 and other short-lived ER chaperones in 200 to 800 nm vesicles called EDEMosomes. LC3-I, EDEM1 and SEL1L play a crucial role in viral replication. a fine balance exists between autophagy modulation and its effect on outcomes of viral infection. the role of JEV nonstructural proteins in subverting the ERAD machinery remains interesting avenues to be explored. cells were grown in DMEM with 10% FBS. all media were supplemented with 100 g/ml penicillin/streptomycin and 2 mM L-glutamine. plasmids obtained from Addgene: Plasmid EGFP-LC3 (11456 deposited by Karla Kirkegaard) and BIP-Myc (27164 deposited by Ron Prywes) all antisera reacted with proteins of the expected sizes in JEV-infected but not in mock-infected cells. the inoculum was removed and 3 washes were given with PBS. plates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 4 to 5 d until plaques became visible. cells were serum-starved, treated with inhibitors, mock- or JEV-infected. western blots are representative of infection in a majority of the cell population and not a fraction of cells. qRT-PCR of JEV RNA, end point plaque assays and cell death assays were done across MOIs 0.1 to 5. homogeneous amounts of protein extracts were separated on polyacrylamide gels and transferred to PVDF membranes for immunoblotting.
