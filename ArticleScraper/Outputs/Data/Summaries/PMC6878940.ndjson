{"summary": "IFN-1 (IL29), IFN-2 (IL28A), IFN-3 (IL28B) and IFN-4. all IFN-s signal through a unique IFNLR1:IL10R receptor complex. both type I and III IFNs activate the transcription of hundreds of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) (1) that exhibit numerous autocrine and paracrine antiviral roles. human macrophages, not monocytes, are a dominant, physiologically relevant IFN- responsive population capable of orchestrating tissue inflammation. this is achieved through a direct immuno-stimulatory response to IFN-3 and subsequent NK and T cell chemotaxis and activation. macrophages are responsive to IFN-3 and accumulate in inflamed human liver. we measured mRNA expression of the IFN- receptor, IFNLR1, in blood leukocytes by digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) ddPCR enables the precise quantification of RNA transcripts by performing the PCR reaction within >10,000 oil droplets. ddPCR enables the precise quantification of RNA transcripts by performing the PCR reaction within >10,000 oil droplets. LR1 expression was significantly higher than monocyte, NK and T cell populations. time course analysis showed that IFNLR1 expression quickly rises following monocyte plating, reaching a 30 increase at 24 h even in the absence of GM-CSF addition (p 0.001, n 5) (B) monocytes were differentiated for 7 days with GM-CSF or M-CSF alone. resulting M populations are differentially responsive to inflammatory stimuli. the resulting M populations are thus M1- or M2-shifted. M-CSF and GM-CSF differentiated macrophages respond differently to IFN- and IFN-3. western blot of IFNAR1 and IFNLR1 from four healthy subjects confirmed these findings (B) monocytes did not phosphorylate STAT1 in response to IFN-3. both M-Ms and GM-Ms were highly sensitive. all measured ISGs were significantly increased by both IFNs. monocyte differentiation with IFN-3 drives a pro-inflammatory macrophage phenotype. RNA sequencing (n = 3/treatment) showed that GM-CSF Ms were significantly more responsive to IFN-3. GM-Ms were significantly more responsive to IFN-3, up-regulating 463 genes 2-fold compared to 184 genes in M-Ms. GM-Ms down-regulated 467 genes 2-fold compared to 252 genes in M-Ms. gene induction was confirmed by qPCR from a larger group of donors. m-Ms were considerably more sensitive to IFN-, whereas GM-Ms responded strongly to IFN-. inflammatory mediators including CCL2, IL1B, and TNF transcripts were increased by IFN- in both M subsets. metacore gene networks up-regulated by IFN-3.

GM-Ms differentiated with IFN-3 significantly increased NK cell cytotoxicity as measured by CD107a expression. NK cells were incubated with Ms overnight, removed, and co-cultured with K562 cells. NK cell IFN- production was also increased following co-culture with IFN-3 treated GM-Ms. phagocytosis was examined by flow cytometry. is of K562 cells (30% increase) and E. coli bacteria (10% increase) in M-M alone. M-M DAPI MFI, representing bacterial engulfment, was significantly higher than M-Ms. M-Ms were more phagocytic than GM-Ms toward K562 cells. IFN-3 increased E. coli engulfment in M-Ms only. TRAIL expression was up-regulated by IFN-3 in GM-Ms only. qPCR for apoptosis markers Caspase 3 (Casp3), Caspase 7 (Casp7) and Bax were performed. GM-Ms differentiated with IFN-3 stimulated an increase of early apoptotic (Annexin V+, PI) cells, by 20 and 90%, respectively, compared to mock treated controls. IFNLs were increased in both viral (>10-fold IFNL1, IFNL2/3 HCV vs. healthy) and non-viral (e.g., 2-fold IFNL1, IFNL2/3 NAFLD/NASH vs. healthy) liver disease. chronic inflammatory conditions can increase hepatic IFN- expression. NK (CD56+), NKT (CD3+, CD56+), and T cells (CD3+, CD56+) (D) were cultured with 100 ng/ml IFN-3 for 10 h. ISG mRNA expression was compared to mock treated cells (E) express IFNLR1 compared to liver NK (CD3 and CD56+), NKT (CD3+ and CD56+), and T cells (CD3+ and CD56+) hepatic T cell enrichment negatively correlated with blood white blood cell count (r = 0.678, p 0.05) increased abundance of IFNLR1 was confirmed following monocyte to macrophage differentiation using seven datasets from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (35). expression of the IFNLR1 transcript was quickly increased as early as 16 h post-plating, reaching a 30-fold increase at 24 h. pDCs were highly responsive to IFN-3, whereas monocytes and NK cells were not (n 5) data are representative of two (B,C) and three independent experiments (A,D) Ms express elevated surface expression of CD14 and CD16, reduced CD1C, and adhere strongly to culture dishes. differentiation increases the abundance of the type I IFN receptor, IFNAR1 transcript (Figure 2A), and protein (Figure 2B) 2-fold as compared to monocytes irrespective of stimulus. ISG transcripts for ISG15, viperin, CD80, and TRAIL were examined to measure M sensitivity to IFN- (50 U/ml) and IFN-3 (100 ng/ml) (D) monocytes did not phosphorylate STAT1 in response to IFN-3, while both M-Ms and GM-Ms were highly sensitive. GM-Ms were more sensitive to IFN-3, increasing the expression of both ISG15 and viperin compared to M-Ms. monocyte differentiation with IFN-3 drives a pro-inflammatory macrophage phenotype. GM-CSF M ISG induction was significantly stronger, as demonstrated by heat map of gene log 2-fold change (logFC). IFN-3 increased transcript abundance of numerous ISGs and transcription factors (TFs) in both M sets, as well as numerous chemokines, cytokines, and genes responsible for antigen (Ag) presentation. a Th1 chemokine profile (CCL3, 4, and 5 and CXCL9, 10, and 11) was found in response to maturation with IFN-3, with stronger induction in GM-Ms. a 2-way ANOVA was performed to assess the role of differentiation (M- vs. GM-CSF), interferon treatment (IFN- and -3) a significant interaction between IFN treatment and differentiation was observed for all measured genes (CXCL10, CCL8, IL15; p 0.001, CD80; p 0.01, TRAIL, TNF; p 0.05) apart from IL1B and CCL2. a significant interaction between IFN treatment and differentiation was observed for all measured genes. IFN-gamma signaling 2.07E-07 Leucocyte chemotaxis 2.55E-07 Interferon Lambda promotes lymphocyte migration and NK cell degranulation. transwell migration assays were performed using autologous PBMCs. autologous NK cells were incubated with Ms for 16 h a ratio of 1:1. GM-Ms differentiated with IFN-3 significantly increased NK cell cytotoxicity. NK cells were incubated overnight, removed, and co-cultured with K562 cells. phagocytosis was examined by flow cytometry. phenotype is highly phagocytic and efficient at presenting antigen (40), a phenotype that can be replicated in vitro. IFN-3 stimulates macrophage phagocytosis of apoptotic cells. apoptotic K562 cells or E. coli were added to M cultures for 1 h. IFN-3 stimulated GM-M cytotoxicity, increasing the percentage of early (Annexin V+) and late (Annexin V+, PI+) apoptotic cells. early apoptosis alone was affected in M-Ms (D) low expression of TRAIL in untreated Ms may explain lack of apoptosis following co-culture. no nitric oxide production by M- or GM-Ms was found in response to IFN-3, bacterial or infected cell stimulus. IFNL1, IFNL2/3, and IFNLR1 expression were measured in healthy, autoimmune hepatitis, and HCV infected liver tissue (n 9/group) (A) biopsy sections obtained from healthy, autoimmune hepatitis were labeled with monocyte/M markers CD11b and CD68 as well as IFNLR1 antibodies. biopsies were labeled with IFNLR1 and CD68 or CD11b antibodies. all CD68+ and a fraction of CD11b+ cells were labeled with IFNLR1. immuno-labeling was performed using CD68 or CD11b in combination with CD3. macrophages are highly sensitive to IFN- through the induction of IFNLR1 expression. monocytes likely become IFN- responsive upon movement into tissue and subsequent differentiation. subsequent effects of IFN- on Ms can be categorized into direct and indirect effects. IFN-s are necessary for epithelial barrier protection in the lungs, liver and gastrointestinal tract, but their dysregulation has been associated with a number of diseases that lack an obvious association with microbial infection. the effectiveness of direct acting antiviral therapy has ultimately overshadowed the antiviral role of IFN-s in the liver. in response to IFN-, GM-Ms potently express Th1 chemokines including CXCL 9, 10, and 11 as well as IL-15 and IL-27, notable drivers of T and NK cell activation and proliferation. DDX58 [RIG-I] can increase antigen recognition, as we have shown in Figure 5. cytotoxicity, suppression of tumor growth and metastases have been further validated using murine models of Th2 diseases where IFN- alleviated symptoms of airway disease (60), intestinal inflammation (61), and conjunctivitis (62). Interestingly, GM-Ms were significantly more responsive to IFN-, whereas M-Ms where more responsive to IFN-. neutrtrophils are the only other immune cell subset with a defined IFN- response. these data support a pro-inflammatory role for IFN-s. they are likely implicated in the elimination of acute infection and the promotion of tissue damage in chronic disease.
