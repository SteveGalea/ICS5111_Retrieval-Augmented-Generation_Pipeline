{"summary": "steroid therapy is a key component of the treatment regimen for SARS Charles D Gomersall SARS is a potentially life-threatening disease caused by infection with SARS coronavirus. the early phase of the disease appears to be due to the virus itself whereas the later phase is thought to be due to an inflammatory response. despite this you worry about the adverse effects of steroid therapy, especially in critically ill patients. corticosteroids may have a beneficial effect in those who fail to improve by day 7 of respiratory failure. other ARDS data suggest that steroids do not worsen outcome despite the inclusion of patients with ARDS due to sepsis. steroids have been used in the treatment of SARS based on the hypothesis that disease manifestations are in part due to the host's inflammatory response. steroid therapy causes significant adverse effects, and this remains true in patients with SARS. the appropriate timing of steroid therapy causes significant adverse effects. steroids have been advocated for the late immune-mediated phase of the disease. the appropriate dosing of steroid therapy for SARS is unknown. in the Toronto cohort only 40% of patients received steroids. mortality was similar to that in reports from Hong Kong [17,21] where high doses were commonly used. steroids are often used in desperate and life-threatening situations. no benefit has been proven for this disease or related conditions such as ARDS or viral pneumonias."}
