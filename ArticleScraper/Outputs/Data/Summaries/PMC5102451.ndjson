{"summary": "a respiratory syndrome of shingleback lizards has been anecdotally described since the 1990s. clinical signs consistent with URTI are reportedly one of the main drivers for shingleback lizard admissions at Kanyana. a dedicated facility was built in 2004 to provide intensive care and quarantine capacity for affected individuals. tiologic agent treatment consisted of broad-spectrum antibiotic (Enrofloxacin, 10mg/kg, im), nebulisation with distilled water, an antiprotozoal (Metronidazole, 40mg/kg, oral), and supportive care including oral rehydration with 0.9% sodium chloride. prevalence and epidemiology of respiratory disease in wild shingleback lizards, and thus the conservation implications, are also currently unknown. there are few systematic and targeted epidemiological studies of respiratory diseases in wild reptile populations except in the case of mycoplasmosis (Mycoplasma agassizii) and herpesviral disease in chelonians. there are few systematic and targeted epidemiological studies of respiratory disease in lizards, captive or wild, in the peer-reviewed literature. the nidovirales are classified into the families Arteriviridae, Coronaviridae, Mesoniviridae and Roniviridae. the family is represented by the Coronavirinae and Torovirinae subfamilies. these include significant zoonotic pathogens such as SARS and MERS coronaviruses. cases were categorised initially by dedicated shingleback lizard rehabilitation staff. samples were then confirmed or re-classified by a wildlife veterinarian. sterile neonatal flocked swab (FLOQSwabsTM; Copan) was used to collect secretions from the oral cavity. sample, 10 L of Protoscript II buffer (New England BioLabs) and 2 L of Protoscript II First Strand cDNA enzyme (New England BioLabs) under the following reaction conditions: 25\u00b0C for 5 min, 42\u00b0C for 60 min and 95\u00b0C for 3 min. double-stranded DNA products were amplified using primer NGS1 (CCTTGAAGGCGGACTGTGAG) at a final concentration of 1 M. RT-PCR reactions were performed using one Taq one-Step reaction mix. primers LnF (CGGAGTGGACAAGTCGTGAA) and LnR (GGACTCAGTGCGGTGAGAAA), and the probe Lnprobe (FAM- CGTCGCCGGTCAGACAGCGAGCC-BHQ1) targeting a region. the presence of conserved domains in the replicase polyprotein was predicted using Geneious v9.1.5. a discrete Gamma distribution was used to model evolutionary rate differences among sites. trees were rooted on the polyprotein 1ab gene or RdRp domain sequence of Cavally virus. a sterile neonatal flocked swab (FLOQSwabsTM; Copan) was used to collect secretions from the oral cavity at the level of the glottis. samples were stored at -20\u00b0C, and transferred to an -80\u00b0C freezer within two weeks. individuals were treated according to their health status. samples underwent reverse transcription using 1 L primer NGS1random (CCTTGAAGGCGGACTGTGAGN8) at a concentration of 100 M, 7 L of purified sample, 10 L of Protoscript II buffer (New England BioLabs) and 2 L of Protoscript II First Strand cDNA enzyme (New England BioLabs) PCR clean up was performed using a Wizard SV gel and PCR kit (Promega) primers BTnidoF (CGCGCAGAGTCATTTGACGTG) and BTnidoR (CCGACGATGATGATCTTTGCTGC) were developed based on an overlap sequence present in 5 of the contigs. the primers amplified a 391 bp product within ORF 1b. read data was imported into CLC Genomics Workbench V7.5 (Qiagen) and demultiplexed, before de novo assembly was performed. contigs were searched for homology to viral agents using BLASTn and BLASTx algorithms through the NCBI server. the presence of conserved domains in the replicase polyprotein was analysed using interProScan [37] and HHpred [38]. the resultant numbers for testing according to the case definition were therefore 49 \u2018cases\u2019 and 33 \u2018healthy\u2019 individuals. one individual considered healthy on admission was unable to be assigned as it was in poor body condition. smallest contig was 1109 nucleotides (nt) in length and largest was 9534 nt in length. a single pool had a small number of contigs return hits to Bearded dragon parvovirus NSP1. mapping the reads back to this genome only resulted in 54 reads being mapped to a very short segment of approximately 80 nucleotides. the odds of being RT-PCR positive for \u2018cases\u2019 was significantly higher than \u2018healthy\u2019 individuals (OR = 5.0, 95%CI: 1.5\u201316.4, p = 0.006). normalised samples were tested by qRT-PCR to determine if there was a difference in Ct values between \u2018cases\u2019 and \u2018healthy\u2019 individuals. nidoviruses produce a large polyprotein, designated polyprotein 1ab (pp1ab) this is produced via a -1 ribosomal frameshift occurring at the slippery sequence resulting in a protein coded by both replicon ORFs 1a and 1b. the spike protein amino acid sequence was found to have 27% similarity to python nidovirus (AII00826) across 99% of the sequence. the membrane amino acid sequence was found to have 37% similarity to Ball python nidovirus (YP_009052479.1) across 90% of the sequence. the virus appears most closely related to the recently described nidovirus species found in pythons. it is proposed that this virus be designated Shingleback nidovirus 1. the sequence has been deposited in GenBank under the accession number KX184715. 83 individuals were entered into the study, including 48 \u2018cases\u2019 and 35 \u2018healthy\u2019 individuals based on assessment at admission. one individual considered healthy on admission was unable to be assigned as it was in poor body condition, however did not have clinical signs of oculonasal discharge. category N RT-PCR +ve RT-PCR -ve Prevalence (95% CI) OR (95% CI) p-value Case 49 20 29 41% (27\u201356%) 5.0 (1.5\u201316.4)

RT-PCR positive were prepared as above for miSeq sequencing. this produced a further three contigs with sizes of 2639, 7739 and 13,813 nt demonstrating low-level homology to ball-python nidovirus (KJ935003.1) with BLASTn query coverage and identity percentages of 7/79, 5/22 and 13/70 respectively. normalised samples were tested by qRT-PCR to determine if there was a difference in Ct values between \u2018cases\u2019 and \u2018healthy\u2019 individuals. the average Ct \u2018cases\u2019 was 33.98 and for \u2018healthy\u2019 36.05. conserved nidovirus domains and their position within pp 1ab are indicated in an expanded view of the amino acid sequence below. a key feature of nidoviruses is the production of a large polyprotein, designated polyprotein 1ab (pp1ab) this is produced via a -1 ribosomal frameshift occurring at the slippery sequence resulting in a protein coded by both replicon ORF 1a and 1b. ython nidovirus (AII00826) across 99% of the sequence. the membrane amino acid sequence was found to have 37% similarity to ball python nidovirus (YP_009052479.1) across 90% of the sequence. the size of the membrane protein is within the range reported for other nidoviruses. pp1ab sequences of members of the Torovirus genus, Bafinivirus genus, suggested Barnivirus genus and possum nidovirus. tree with highest log likelihood is shown. a significant association between a novel virus found in oropharyngeal secretions, and cases of an enigmatic respiratory disease of wild shingleback lizards admitted to rehabilitation in the Perth region of Western Australia. the study describes a significant association between a novel virus found in oropharyngeal secretions, and cases of an enigmatic respiratory disease. phylogenetic analysis of this nidovirus shows that it clusters with the recently discovered Ball python nidovirus and python nidovirus. similarity across the pp1ab between the putative Shingleback nidovirus 1 and the python nidoviruses of approximately 50% is greater than that between Shingleback nidovirus 1 and members of the Bafinivirus and we found a significant association between respiratory disease and the RT-PCR detection of the novel nidovirus. we also found RT-PCR positive individuals that were apparently healthy, and case-positive individuals that were not RT-PCR positive. we minimised observer bias by using same rehabilitation staff member to assign cases. there is evidence the described respiratory syndrome is widespread in wild shingleback lizards of the Perth region. it is critical to determine the distribution and impact of this virus in wild shingleback lizards and related genera. more widespread screening of related genera and sympatric lizard species is also important to determine if there are alternate species that may act as reservoirs or spillover hosts. pathogen discovery tools are increasingly being used in wildlife disease investigations [10, 17, 53, 54], although uptake is considered slow comparative to health research in humans and domestic animals. a relative lack of baseline information on normal viruses and host ecology in wild reptiles can limit epidemiological interpretation of infectious disease findings for these species."}
