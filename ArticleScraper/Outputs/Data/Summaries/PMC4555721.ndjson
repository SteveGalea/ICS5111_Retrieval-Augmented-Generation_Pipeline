{"summary": "VTE represents a spectrum of conditions that include pulmonary embolism (PE), chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) and deep venous thrombosis (DVT) the high morbidity, mortality and misdiagnosis rate render VTE as a worldwide health problem. study was undertaken to detect the mRNA expression levels of NK cells in PBMCs isolated from PE patients. the whole human genome microarray and Gene Ontology analysis was performed to investigate the changes in NK cells in PE patients. in the control group, 20 patients (11 males and 9 females) with a mean age of 7214 years (4491 years) were enrolled during the same period. no significant difference in age was found between PE patients and controls. RNA was reversely transcribed into double strand cDNA. modified aaUTP can interact with Cy3 NHS ester forming fluorescent products. hybridization mixture was pre-pared with Agilent oligonucleotide microarray plus kit. independent-samples t test was used to compare mRNA levels in samples from PE patients and controls. independent-samples T Test was used to compare mRNA levels in samples from PE patients and controls. the pulmonary artery pressure was 50-108 mmHg in CTEPH patients. the proportion of CD16+CD56+ NK cells in VTE patients was all compared with the detection intervals of normal population (8.6-21.1%) the functions of more than 70% of genes in the microarray have been known. all patients of both groups were subjected to microarray analysis. sample marking and hybridization Indirect approach was applied to mark samples. gene expressions of target genes normalized by that of GAPDH (2-Ct) RT-PCR was consistent with microarray analysis. differentially expressed genes were identified from whole genomes. independent-samples T Test was used to compare mRNA levels. toxicity, were remarkably down-regulated compared with control group (P0.05), while the difference of KIR receptors, KLRC2, KLRC4, NCR2 and NCR3 between two groups had no statistical significance. mRNA expression of KIR receptors was lower than that of controls consistently. four inhibitory receptors (KLRB1, KLRD1, KLRF1, KLRG1) and four activating receptors (KLRC1, KLRC3, NCR1 and KLRK1) were uniformly down-regulated compared with control group. difference of KIR receptors, KLRC2, KLRC4, NCR2 and NCR3 between two groups had no statistical significance. +CD56+ NK cells were decreased in 16 out of 41 patients. compared with the detection intervals of normal population (8.6-21.1%) the proportion of activated NK cells declined. influenza virus [14], herpes simplex virus [15], cytomegalovirus [17], human immunodeficiency virus [18] have high tendency to VTE this decade. a case-control study involving 1,454 adults enrolled in 11 french centers concluded that influenza vaccination was associated with a reduced risk of VTE. patients with compromised NK cell function are susceptible to infection, especially viral infection, which is a high risk factor for VTE. the current study provided a new insight into a novel role for NK cells in the pathogenesis of venous thrombosis."}
