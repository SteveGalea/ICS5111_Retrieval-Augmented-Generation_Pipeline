{"summary": "coronaviruses require host proteins to aid in the stages from virus entry to progeny release. entry of the virus particle into a host cell requires the recognition of specific cell surface proteins. ribonucleocapsid releases the 5\u2032-capped viral genome, a single-stranded positive-sense RNA. transcripts are destined to be packaged into progeny virions. subgenomic, positive-sense transcripts are being translated into four structural proteins, spike (S), nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M) and envelope (E) proteins. in virus RNA synthesis, the replicase complex is indispensable but not an exclusive participant. the RNA-binding domain of MADP1 and the RNA secondary structure responsible for the interaction were mapped and defined. Upon silencing of MADP1 using siRNA, viral RNA synthesis on general has been affected, resulting in a lower replication efficiency and infectivity. template DNAs were removed by digestion with RNase-free DNase I (Roche Applied Science) and the labeled RNAs purified with UltraPure Phenol:Chloroform:Isoamyl Alcohol (Invitrogen) then solubilized in nuclease-free water. nucleotide sequences of primers used to amplify DNA templates for in vitro transcription. pT_EGFP_F 5\u2032-TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGG-3\u2032 T7_EGFP_510-528R 5\u2032-TGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCTGCCGTCCTCGATGTTG-3\u2032 LDX30 5\u2032-UTR1 T7_i1-27 pT_i140-121 5\u2032-UTR2 T7_i1-27 pT_i99- l yeast tRNA (Ambion) and 1 U/l Protector RNase Inhibitor (Roche Applied Science) were incubated with 40 l (50% slurry) of streptavidin agarose beads (Sigma Aldrich) at room temperature for 30 min. beads were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with RNase P (RP) buffer. cells were infected with recombinant IBV-Luc at a multiplicity of infectivity of 1 (MOI 1) and incubated for 2 h at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2. infected cells were subjected to lysis either through three freeze\u2013thaw cycles (at 80\u00b0C and room temperature, respectively) the TCID50 of the infected cells at each time point was determined by using the freeze\u2013thawed infected cells. for each sample, a 10-fold serial dilution was performed and five wells of Vero cells on 96-well plates were infected with each dilution. RT was performed with Expand reverse transcriptase (Roche) 14931-F and the antisense primer IBV15600-R were used for PCR. if replication of viral RNA occurred, a 670-bp PCR fragment would be expected. construction and selection of stable knockdown cell lines Oligonucleotides were designed based on siMadp1 sequence. Biotin-RNA pull-down assay Template DNA was amplified from plasmid DNA encoding the 5\u2032 end of IBV genome with various sets of primers targeting different regions of the 5\u2032-UTR. biotinylated RNAs were in vitro transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science) at 37\u00b0C for 2 h. anti-sense primer IBV 5\u2032-UTR (+ T7_i1-27 pT_i507-528R 5\u2032-UTR1 T7_i1-27 pT_i140-121 5\u2032-UTR2 T7_i1-27 pT_i99-80 5\u2032-UTR3 T7_i30-51 pT_140-121 5\u2032-UTR4 T7_i30-51 pT_140-121 5\u2032-UT the mixtures were incubated with 40 l (50% slurry) of streptavidin agarose beads (Sigma Aldrich) at room temperature for 30 min. the beads were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with RNase P (RP) buffer. cells were infected with recombinant IBV-Luc at a multiplicity of infectivity of 1 (MOI 1) and incubated for 2 h at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2. cells were either harvested immediately (0 h) or continued to be incubated at 37\u00b0C until specific time points post infection. cells were subjected to lysis either through three freeze\u2013thaw cycles. the luciferase activity was used as an indication of viral activity for the recombinant virus. an end-point dilution assay was used as a measurement of virus titer. a 415-bp PCR product corresponding to the 5\u2032-terminal region of subgenomic mRNA 5 and a 648-bp fragment corresponding to the 5\u2032-terminal region of subgenomic mRNA 4 would be expected. RT was carried out with the sense primer IBV14931-F (5\u2032-14931GCTTATCCACTAGTACATC14949-3\u2032) to detect negative-stranded genomic RNA. virus RNA was a yeast-based three-hybrid (34) screen against a human cDNA library using the 5\u2032-UTR of SARS-CoV RNA as bait. each screen yielded about six to eight colonies which were sequenced and non-sense sequences of the candidates were eliminated. ribosomal protein L27a was reported to function as an anti-apoptotic protein, which was not the focus of our screen. -expressed MADP1 was found to be able to interact with the 5\u2032-UTR of IBV and SARS-CoV RNA. over-expressed protein was used to facilitate detection. there was no commercially available antibody to the protein at that time. over-expressing Flag-tagged IBV N protein were added to mixtures of a fixed concentration of biotinylated IBV 3\u2032-UTR RNA and unlabeled IBV 3\u2032-UTR or EGFP RNA. total cell lysates containing Flag-tagged MADP1 were incubated with 0.1 M biotinylated IBV 5\u2032-UTR in the presence of increasing concentrations of either unlabeled specific competitor RNA probe (IBV 5 over-expressed flag-tagged MADP1 translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm MADP1 was identified as a component of the 18 S U11/12 snRNP. its subcellular localization was determined to be in the nucleoplasm (35). flag-tagged MADP1 was over-expressed in cultured Vero cells, which were then infected with IBV and treated with actinomycin D to inhibit host transcription. ected cells probed with Flag antibody showed negative staining for the over-expressed protein. similar colocalization patterns were also observed in IBV-infected H1299 cells. stem\u2013loop I\u2013III of the 5\u2032-UTR (5\u2032-UTR1 and 5\u2032-UTR2) abolished the interaction with MADP1. the rest region of the 5\u2032-UTR (5\u2032-UTR4) did not interact with MADP1. mutant RNAs spanning stem\u2013loops I\u2013III were assessed for its ability to bind MADP1. stem\u2013loop disrupting mutation (5\u2032-UTR2M1) failed to interact with MADP1. RNA recognition motif (RRM) of MADP1 is responsible for its interaction with IBV 5\u2032-UTR. the first three mutants, Madp1n which contains the RRM domain, Madp1m spans the zinc finger domain and Madp1c contains mostly phosphorylation sites, were assessed for their ability to interact with IBV 5\u2032-UTR. only Madp1n retained a low level of the RNA-binding activity. mutants were used in a biotin-RNA pull-down assay with the full-length IBV 5\u2032-UTR. an extension of 14 or 31 amino acid residues was made for Madp1x and Madp1z respectively. a truncation at the N-terminus by 40 residues as well as an extension by 14 amino acid residues was made for Madp1x. lysates were assessed for their respective RNA-binding affinities for full-length IBV 5\u2032-UTR. all mutants resulted in a reduction in RNA-binding affinity for the biotinylated RNA molecule. the reduction was most dramatic for triple residue mutant YVF. RT-PCR analysis of the effect of MADP1 knockdown on IBV RNA replication. H1299 cells were transfected twice with siRNA targeting either Madp1 (+siMadp1) or EGFP (\u2013siMadp1) and infected with IBV-Luc recombinant virus 3 days after the first transfection. four additional siRNA duplexes targeting different regions of MADP1 were used to check their effect on IBV infection. all six combinations of five different siRNA duplexes resulted in a reduction in the luciferase activity of the infected cells by either 70% (siCombi 3 and 4), without siMadp1 or more than 90% (siCombi 1, 2, 5 and 6) with siMadp1. this implies that knocking down MADP1 the expression of MADP1 and the effect of MADP1-knockdown on IBV infection were tested using northern blot. the results showed that silencing of MADP1 with shRNA reduced the amount of viral mRNA production before 16 h post-infection. the amount of virus mRNA is higher in shMadp1 cells compared to shNC cells beyond 16 h of infection. 1 stable cell clone was transfected with constructs expressing flag-tagged wild-type MADP1 (FM) and its triple mutant [FM(YVF)], siRNA-resistant MADP1 (FMmut) and its triple mutant [FMmut(YVF)], negative controls EGFP (E) and empty vector control (F), respectively. western blotting results showed an obvious increase in the amount of IBV N expression in cells over-expressing silencing-resistant wild-type MADP1 an assessment of the luciferase activity of total cell lysates showed that over-expression of triple residue mutants FM(YVF) and FMmut(YVF) resulted in a slight increase of the luciferase activity in shMadp1 cells. over-expression of silencing-resistant wild-type MADP1 (FMmut) resulted in a more drastic increase of the luciferase activity in shMadp1 cells the 5\u2032 UTR of IBV, SARS-CoV and HCoV-OC43 was interacted with MADP1. total cell lysates prepared from H1299 cells over-expressing Flag-tagged MADP1 were mixed with biotinylated RNA probes of full-length 5\u2032 UTRs of the three coronaviruses. the predicted secondary structures of stem\u2013loop I from IBV, SARS-CoV and HCoV-OC43 were HAX1 was reported to function as an anti-apoptotic protein. the 5\u2032-UTR of coronavirus genomic RNA interacts specifically with MADP1. over-expressed flag-tagged MADP1 was used to facilitate detection. DP1 were mixed with 0.1 M of biotinylated IBV and SARS-CoV 5\u2032-UTR. unbound complexes to the beads were eluted with gel loading buffer. increasing concentrations of unlabeled specific competitor RNA led to decreasing co-purification of MADP1 with the biotinylated RNA probe. however, increasing concentrations of unlabeled non-specific competitor RNA did not result in detectable change to the efficiency of MADP1 co-purification. newly synthesized viral RNA was labeled with BrUTP. cells were fixed at 10 h post-infection to allow sufficient labeling. flag-tagged MADP1 appeared to be present in the cytoplasm as well. four truncated mutant RNA fragments were synthesized by in vitro transcription. 5\u2032-UTR1 contains stem\u2013loops I\u2013IV (38), 5\u2032-UTR2 and 5\u2032-UTR3. 5\u2032-UTR4 spans the rest of the 388 nucleotides. total cell lysates prepared from H1299 cells over-expressing Flag-tagged MADP1 were mixed with RNA probes spanning different regions of IBV 5\u2032-UTR. the RNA\u2013protein complexes were purified with streptavidin beads, resolved by SDS\u2013PAGE and probed with antibody to Flag tag for the presence of flag-tagged MADP1 protein. stem\u2013loop restoring mutation at nucleotide residues 25 and 26 from UC to AG was able to restore partially the interaction (5\u2032-UTR2M2) this result affirmed the conclusion that the secondary structure of stem\u2013loop I of IBV 5\u2032-UTR is indispensable for its interaction with MADP1. lysates prepared from H1299 cells over-expressing Flag-tagged wild-type MADP1 or its truncation mutants were used for biotin-RNA pull-down assay using the full-length IBV 5\u2032-UTR. both the crude lysates (labeled C) and protein bound on the streptavidin beads (labeled E) were resolved by SDS\u2013PAGE and detected by Western blot with anti-Flag antibody. extension beyond the RRM (Madp1x) may have been required to preserve the integrity of the protein structure. information available on this domain indicated three amino acids at its active site, which interact with nucleic acid residues via their aromatic and hydrophobic side chains. the identified active site was composed of phenylalanine 55 and valine 53, respectively, while tyrosine 13 may have acted as an anchor for the phosphate backbone via electrostatic interactions. IBV-infected samples were harvested at 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 h post-infection. mock-infected cells were harvested at 24 h post-infection. levels of negative stranded genomic RNA and both the positive and negative stranded subgenomic RNA were assessed by RT-PCR. luciferase gene activity measured for the cell lysate indicated a dramatic drop in viral activity in the Madp1 silenced H1299 cells. western blot analysis also noted a reduction in the expression of viral structural genes, between 50% and 90% reduction for S and N proteins, with a reduction between 40% and 80% of MADP1 protein. two hundred and fifty pico moles (250 pmol) of either siRNA to EGFP or siRNA pools against Madp1 were transfected twice and infected with recombinant luciferase-IBV at 72 h after the first transfection. luciferase activity of the infected cells measured at 20 h post-infection showed a decrease in viral activity after silencing Madp1 with the different siRNA pools. 99 cells stably transfected with either negative control shRNA (shNC) or short hairpin RNA to MADP1 (shMadp1). total RNA was prepared from the two stable clones and separated on 1% agarose gel and probed by a Dig-labeled specific MADP1probe. madp1 cell line was transfected with constructs expressing wild-type MADP1 (FMmut) and triple residue mutant (FMmut(YVF)) the two siRNA-resistant mutants were constructed by mutating the siRNA-targeting sequence with degenerate codons. these transfected cells were subsequently infected with IBV-Luc and harvested at 19 h post-infection. a third coronavirus, HCoV-OC43, was assessed for its binding to MADP1. it was also noted that the predicted stem\u2013loop I structure of HCoV-OC43 contained a bulge which encompassed a larger area of the stem compared to SARS-CoV. there was a lack of sequence similarity as well. MADP1 contains two conserved RNA-binding domains, the RNA recognition motif (RRM) 1 and universal minicircle sequence binding protein (UMSBP) domains (a zinc finger CCHC-type) (35) the latter was determined to be the domain responsible for the interaction between MADP1 and the SARS-CoV and IBV 5\u2032-UTR. encing of MADP1 resulted in a marked reduction in syncytium formation upon IBV infection. the synthesis of both genome- (gRNA) and subgenome-length RNAs (sgRNA) was compromised, resulting in a drastic reduction of viral structural protein expression and release of viral progeny (titers) IBV stem\u2013loop I has shorter stem and absence of bulges. the structure may be as unstable thermodynamically as that of SARS-CoV and HCoV-OC43. a weaker binding of MADP1 to the stem\u2013loop I restoring mutant (5\u2032-UTR2M2) may play a certain role in this interaction. gammacoronavirus IBV can bind to MADP1 albeit with different affinities. it is yet to be demonstrated if this weaker binding dictates less dependency on MADP1 in RNA replication and infectivity. over-expression of silencing-sensitive MADP1 was unable to cause an increase in virus infection. compared to that observed for silencing-resistant MADP1 (FMmut) in shMadp1 cells. this lends further support to the conclusion that MADP1 is actively involved in the replication and infectivity of IBV. grant from Nanyang Technological University (SUG M58080000), Singapore. conflict of interest statement."}
