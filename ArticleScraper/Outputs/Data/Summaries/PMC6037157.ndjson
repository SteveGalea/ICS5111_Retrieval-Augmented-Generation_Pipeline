{"summary": "xylometazoline hydrochloride (HCl) is a nasal decongestant that causes vasoconstriction in the nasal submucosa. it is used as the active component in the antiviral nasal spray Coldamaris prophylactic (1.2 mg/mL iota-carrageenan in 0.5% NaCl) and other medical device nasal sprays approved and marketed in the EU. iota-carrageenan demonstrated that the substances do not influence each other. xylometazoline hydrochloride (HCl) is a well-established nasal decongestant. it acts selectively on -adrenergic receptors (alpha-adrenergic agonists) three main forms of carrageenan are commercially used: iota-, kappa- and lambda-carrageenan. they differ in the degree of sulfation, solubility and gelling properties. the antiviral mechanism of carrageenan is based on the interference with viral attachment: carrageenan forms a barrier on the mucosal surface. the intranasal (i.n.) topical application provides reliable and fast relief from the symptoms of nasal congestion and facilitates breathing during common cold/flu-like illnesses and allergic rhinitis. also facilitates drainage of the secretion during sinusitis and can be used as an adjuvant treatment of mucosal swelling due to otitis media. all animals were bred for experimental purposes according to art. 9.2, No. 7 of the German Act on Animal Welfare. the studies were authorized under the BSL BIOSERVICE GmbH licenses to conduct repeated dose toxicity studies granted by the government of Upper Bavaria, Germany. ometazoline HCl 0.5 Carr_0.12% Base formulation Iota-carrageenan 1.2 Xylo_0.05%/Carr_0.12%

ATCC and propagated in the same medium. the stocks were frozen at 80\u00b0C and virus titer was determined by TCID50 assay. the virus was pre-incubated with a dilution series of the test items for 10 minutes at room temperature before a suspension of chicken red blood cells was added. positive control RBCs in the absence of the test sample were fully agglutinated by the virus. inhibition of hemagglutination was observed in wells containing a sufficient amount of iota-carrageenan to inhibit virus binding to RBCs. study was performed by ThioMatriX GmbH (innsbruck, Austria) with the test solutions described in Table 1. aliquots of 2 110 L were withdrawn from the acceptor compartment every 60 minutes. the integrity of the bovine nasal mucosa was proven by transepithelial electrical resistance measurements. the integrity of the bovine nasal mucosa was proven by transepithelial electrical resistance measurements. a full histopathology was carried out only on nasal cavities (including turbinates, left and right nostrils), brain (including bulbus olfactorius, medulla/pons cerebellar and cerebral cortex) a statistical assessment was performed for each sex using a one-way ANOVA. the human cervical epithelial carcinoma cell line (HeLa) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) the cells were cultivated in Dulbecco\u2019s minimal essential medium (Sigma-Aldrich, Vienna, Austria) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1% antibiotic\u2013antimycotic mix (Sigma-Aldrich) in an incubator at 37\u00b0C a medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotic\u2013antimycotic mix was used. human coronavirus OC43 (hCoV OC43) vero (embryonic African green monkey kidney) cells were purchased from ATCC. the virus was pre-incubated with a dilution series of test samples and controls for 10 minutes. after an infection period of 30 minutes, cells were washed and further cultivated in the presence of the test samples at the same concentrations as during the virus pre-incubation period. fertilized eggs were placed in a motor-driven egg incubator at 37.5\u00b0C to start embryonic development. on embryo development day, 5 eggs were rotated and stored with blunt end up. on EDD 6, 1\u20131.5 mL of albumen was extracted from a punctured hole near the pointed end of the egg. 6 H2O, 4.56 mM KCl, 119.8 mM NaCl, 15 mM NaHCO3, 10 mM D-glucose and 50 mM HEPES buffer pH 7.2 was added to the donor and acceptor chamber. the permeation medium in the donor chamber was substituted by mixtures of 500 L buffer and 500 L xylometazoline HCl test samples. the control group was 140 L per application, 420 L per day (three applications per day) the dosage of the Xylo_0.05%/Carr_0.12% formulation contained the same amount of xylometazoline HCl but no iota-carrageenan. the control comprised the base formulation as described in Table 1. a dilution series of Xylo_0.05%/Carr_0.12%, Carr_0.12% and the assay reference Carr_0.12% in 0.5% NaCl was prepared in the base formulation and 0.5% NaCl. cells were washed and further cultivated in the presence of the test samples at the same concentrations as used during the virus pre-incubation period. the virus was pre-incubated with a dilution series of the test items for 10 minutes at room temperature before a suspension of chicken red blood cells (RBCs) was added. positive control RBCs in the absence of the test sample were fully agglutinated by the virus. inhibition of hemagglutination was observed in wells containing a sufficient amount of iota-carrageenan to inhibit virus binding to RBCs. samples with a size of 3\u20134 cm2 of freshly excised bovine respiratory mucosa of the nasal cavity were inserted in ussing-type chambers displaying a permeation area of 0.64 cm2.28 The apical side of the tissue was therefore facing the donor compartment. the integrity of the bovine nasal mucosa was proven by transepithelial electrical resistance measurements. all studies and tests were carried out in fivefold at least. the wet weight of a set of tissues was taken, and a set of organs/tissues was preserved. a full histopathology was carried out only on nasal cavities (including turbinates, left and right nostrils), brain (including bulbus olfactorius, medulla/pons cerebellar and cerebral cortex) xylometazoline HCl was tested against hRV1a and hRV8. a maximum xylometazoline HCl concentration of 16.7 g/mL was obtained. all iota-carrageenan-containing solutions showed a comparable antiviral effectiveness. the ability of hCoV OC43 to agglutinate chicken erythrocytes can be dose dependently inhibited by iota-carrageenan. this is used in the HAI assay to evaluate the antiviral efficacy of iota-carrageenan-containing test samples. iota-carrageenan retains its antiviral effectiveness in the presence of xylometazoline HCl. the CAM is a highly vascularized membrane that surrounds the developing chicken embryo. the CAM is a highly vascularized membrane that surrounds the developing embryo. the CAM was photographed before and in a time course of 15 and 30 minutes after the application of 300 L test sample Xylo_0.05%/Carr_0.12%. the results are shown as the mean vessel diameter as the percentage of the initial diameter SD of the indicated number of samples per group. the permeation of xylometazoline HCl in the presence (Xylo_0.05%/Carr_0.12%) was evaluated on freshly excised bovine nasal mucosa. Na-Flu was used as the positive control, and fluorescein-labeled dextran with a molecular mass of 500 kDa (FD-500) was used as the negative control. xylometazoline HCl was quantified using ussing-type chambers. after 180 minutes, samples from apical and basolateral buffer reservoirs were collected. xylometazoline HCl was quantified. alanine-aminotransferase, aspartate-aminotransferase or glutamate dehydrogenase were observed in single animals treated with Xylo_0.05%/Carr_0.12%. a slightly higher thymus, epididymides, prostate and ovary weight was also associated with treatment with Xylo_0.05%. xylometazoline HCl does not affect the antiviral effectiveness of iota-carrageenan standardized assays. both assays have already been described elsewhere21,27 and are described in brief in the \u201cMaterials and methods\u201d section. a and hRV8 Effectiveness against hRV1a IC50 95% CI (g/mL) Carr_0.12%/Xylo_0.05% 6.2 2.48 Carr_0.12% 16.5 10.19 Carr_0.12% in 0.5% NaCl 7.3 2.53 Effectiveness against hRV8 IC50 95% CI (g/mL) tested iota-carrageenan concentration of 3 g/mL, a maximum xylometazoline HCl concentration of 1.25 g/mL was obtained. all iota-carrageenan-containing solutions showed the same antiviral effectiveness, namely a MIC of 0.024 g/mL. antiviral effectiveness of iota-carrageenan formulations against hRV1a and hRV8 IC50 95% CI (g/mL) Carr_0.12%/Xylo_0.05% 6.2 2.48 Carr_0.12% 16.5 10.19 Carr_0.12% in 0.5% NaCl 7.3 2.53 Effectiveness against hCoV OC43 The ability of hCoV OC43 to agglutinate chicken erythr a maximum xylo-metazoline HCl concentration of 1.25 g/mL was obtained. all iota-carrageenan-containing solutions showed the same antiviral effectiveness. a MIC of 0.024 g/mL was obtained. fertilized hen\u2019s eggs are incubated under optimized conditions for 9 days. on the 10th day, the eggs are opened and the CAM is exposed. after a defined exposure period, the CAM is evaluated for development of irritant endpoints. effects in the CAM blood vessels and albumen are subjectively assessed and scored. the CAM was photographed before and in a time course of 15 and 30 minutes after the application of 300 L test sample Xylo_0.05%/Carr_0.12% and Xylo_0.05%. the results are shown as the mean vessel diameter as the percentage of the initial diameter SD of the indicated number of samples per group. only 0.71% 0.15% of FD-500 passed the nasal mucosa within 3 hours. xylometazoline HCl without iota-carrageenan (Xylo_0.05%) permeated the tissue. Xylo_0.05%/Carr_0.12% was applied three times/day at a dose/application of 70 g xylometazoline HCl and 168 g iota-carrageenan. a three-time daily administration of neither Xylo_0.05%/Carr_0.12% nor Xylo_0.05% was associated with any clinical symptoms in male or female rabbits. no gross pathological abnormalities or abnormal organ weights of toxicological concern were found in animals treated with Xylo_0.05%/Carr_0.12% or Xylo_0.05%. a slightly higher thymus, epididymides, prostate and ovary weight was also associated with treatment with Xylo_0.05%. iota-carrageenan is effective against a wide range of viruses, enveloped (herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2, human cytomegalovirus, vesicular stomatitis virus, Sindbis virus, influenza virus and human immunodeficiency virus9) and non-enveloped (hRV,21 human papillomavirus10) ones. this rules out a specific interaction of iota-carrageenan with viral nasal mucociliary clearance (NMC) time was determined in 5 healthy volunteers. two nasal spray formulations containing glycyrrhizin as a taste marker with and without 0.18% iota-carrageenan were prepared and blinded. investigations on the compatibility of xylometazoline HCl and iota-carrageenan demonstrated that iota-carrageenan does not impair the efficacy and safety of xylometazoline HCl."}
