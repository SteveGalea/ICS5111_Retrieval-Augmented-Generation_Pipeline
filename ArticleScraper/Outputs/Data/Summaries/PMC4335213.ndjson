{"summary": "norovirus is the major cause of non-bacterial gastroenteritis in the developed world (1\u20133) worldwide, noroviruses are responsible for an estimated 218,000 deaths per annum in children under the age of 5 years and 1.1 million hospital admissions. it is estimated that norovirus infection results in a loss of \u00a3110 million to the united kingdom national health service every year due to more than 45,000 hospital bed closures. eIF4E is thought to be limiting for translation by altering the function of eIFs. eIF4E is regulated by the eIF4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs) which inhibit translation initiation by competing with eIF4G for a cellular mRNA. the interaction of 4E-BP with eIF4E is prevented when 4E-BP is phosphorylated by mTOR, a downstream kinase within the phosphatidylinositol 3\u2032 kinase-Akt-mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K-Akt-mTOR) pathway. poliovirus and vesicular stomatitis virus induce the dephosphorylation of 4E-BP calicivirus RNA lacks the canonical cap structure recognized by eIF4E. previous studies have shown that the norovirus VPg proteins act as a \u201ccap substitute\u201d to mediate translation by interacting with initiation factors. this process is mediated by a high affinity interaction between eIF4G and the C-terminal domain of VPg (39). regulation of eIF4E activity plays a role during MNV1 infection. this could induce translational control of specific host mRNAs. cells were infected with MNV1 at an MOI of 10 TCID50. the cells were washed twice with 1 ml of PBS before harvesting them in 100 l of NLB buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, 25 mm disodium -glycerophosphate, complete protease inhibitor mixture), followed by centrifugation for 3 min at 595 g in a benchtop centrifuge. the samples were adjusted to the same antibodies against eIF4E and MNV1 NS7 (41, 42) have been described previously. antibodies to eIF4E, 4E-BP1 (Thr-36/47, Ser-65, and Thr-70), eIF2 (Ser-52), and corresponding total antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. the effect of signaling inhibitors on viral replication was determined by treating confluent monolayers of cells in 35-mm dishes with increasing concentrations of SCH772984 (ERK1/2;

GCCATCACTC Cells and Viruses Mouse leukemic monocyte-macrophage (RAW264.7) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 4.5 g/liter d-glucose + l-glutamine + pyruvate (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS and 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, 25 mm disodium -glycerophosphate, complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, followed by centrifugation for 3 min at 595 g in a benchtop centrifuge. samples were adjusted to the same concentration of between 20 and 50 g of protein. signal was detected on radiographic film (Fuji RX) and quantified using ImageJ software. antibodies against eIF4E, 4E-BP1 (Thr-36/47, Ser-65, and Thr-70), eIF2 (Ser-52), and corresponding total antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. to measure the effect of inhibitors on viral replication, cells were stimulated with LPS at a concentration of 10 ng l1 harvested as before at 2 and 12 h after stimulation. to measure the effect of inhibitors on viral replication, the cells were infected at an MOI of 0.3 TCID50/cell with MNV1 for 1 h. lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 19,000 g for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C. samples were centrifuged in an SW40Ti rotor at 38,000 rpm for 2 h. cycloheximide was omitted from the lysis buffers and replaced with 10 mm EDTA. first strand cDNA synthesis was performed using equivalent amounts of starting RNA from all samples. for qPCR analysis, the cDNA was analyzed using the PCR Master Mix (Promega) the cDNA was analyzed with the MESA BLUE qPCR MasterMix Plus for SYBR. eIF4E Phosphorylation is important for MNV1 translation in vitro and in vivo. eIF4E is a proteinaceous cap substitute to initiate translation by interacting with eIF4E in vitro and in vivo. 4E2RCat has been identified by high-throughput screening as an eIF4E-eIF4G inhibitor with an IC50 of 13.5 m. it blocks cap-dependent translation in vitro and in cells and inhibits coronavirus replication (45, 46). eIF4E-eIF4G interaction is important for calicivirus replication. cell viability in the presence of 4E2Rcat is expressed as a percentage of the DMSO control set to 100%. results show the means S.E. (error bars) from three separate experiments. e, RAW264.7 cells were infected with MNV1 at an MOI of 10 TCID50/cell. cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting. the infection was monitored by visualization of the viral non-structural protein-7 (NS7). several viral infections induce accumulation of phosphorylated eIF4E that correlate with inhibition of cellular protein synthesis. other infections can lead to eIF4E dephosphorylation (20). phosphorylation status of eIF4E in cells infected with MNV1 by immunoblotting. lysates from mock- and MNV1-infected RAW264.7 cells at 2 or 12 hpi were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immmunoblotting. to further investigate the role of Mnk1 in eIF4E phosphorylation, we analyzed the effect of inhibiting Mnk1 function. lysates were harvested at 2 and 12 hpi and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. lysates were harvested at 2 and 12 hpi and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting for eIF4E. main p38 isoform, p38, shows strong activation during MNV1 infection. p38 and p38 showed no significant change. we used chemical inhibitors of p38 and ERK1/2 kinase activity, SB203580 and SCH772984. the addition of SCH772984 did prevent eIF4E phosphorylation during infection. these data further support a role for eIF4E phosphorylation during infection, driven by p38 rather than ERK. p-eIF4E regulates interferon production by controlling the translation of Nfkbia mRNA, thereby modulating sensitivity to viral infections. p-eIF4E regulates interferon production by controlling the translation of mRNAs. lysates from mock- or MNV1-infected cells were prepared and subjected to a 10\u201350% sucrose gradient centrifugation. a typical polysome profile pattern was obtained, as shown in Fig. 4A. p-eIF4E was associated with polysomal fractions from MNV1-infected cells but not mock-infected cells. mRNA translation status was determined using RT-qPCR. we compared the relative abundance of a set of mRNAs. a TS of >1 represents a translational activation of a particular mRNA. previous studies have demonstrated that the translational activation of Nfkbia mRNA is dependent on p-eIF4E. this in turn impairs interferon production by up-regulating the translation of the NF-B inhibitor IB. this in turn impairs interferon production by up-regulating the translation of the NF-B inhibitor IB and leads to increased sensitivity to viral infection. ribosomal subunit, 60 S (large ribosomal subunit), 80 S (monosome) and polysome peaks are labeled. the mean polysome/monosome ratio was calculated and normalized. phosphorylated eIF4E is detected only in polysomal fractions. qPCR amplification was carried out using a transcriptor first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Roche Applied Science) qPCR results from three independent biological isolates of both mock- and MNV1-infected cells. the bars represent the mean, and the error bars show the S.E. 4E2RCat did not affect the viability of the host cells. at the concentrations used in our studies, from 10 to 25 m, no effect was detected on RAW264.7 cell viability. the efficacy of cap Sepharose pull-down in the presence of 4E2Rcat was determined using immunoblotting for eIF4E and eIF4G. results show the means S.E. (error bars) from three separate experiments. lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting. the infection was monitored by visualization of the viral non-structural protein-7 (NS7), the 3D polymerase. the lysates from mock- and MNV1-infected RAW264.7 cells were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting at the 6 and 14 hpi time points of the 18-h replication cycle. the lysates from mock- and MNV1-infected RAW264.7 cells were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting. the steady-state levels of Mnk1 in cells at 2 or 12 hpi were not affected. however, MNV1 infection led to an increase in Mnk1 phosphorylation. eIF4E phosphorylation by Mnk1 is important for MNV1 replication. eIF4E phosphorylation can regulate the phosphorylation of eIF4E. at both 2 and 12 hpi, ERK1 and p38 are activated during MNV1 infection. RAW264.7 cells were then treated with SB203580 or SCH772984. they were infected at an MOI of 0.3 TCID50/cell with MNV1 for 12 h. the addition of SCH772984 also impaired the phosphorylation of eIF4E. eIF4E signaling through p38 is important for MNV1 replication. phospho-MAPK array (R&D Systems) was used to compare relative quantities of phosphorylated ERK and p38 between 2 and 12 hpi. the results were analyzed using ImageJ software. p-eIF4E regulates interferon production by controlling the translation of a subset of mRNAs. p-eIF4E regulates interferon production by controlling the translation of Nfkbia mRNA, thereby modulating sensitivity to viral infections. p-eIF4E was associated with polysomal fractions from MNV1-infected cells but not mock-infected cells. the association of p-eIF4E with polysomes was impaired when run-off of polysomes was induced with EDTA. p-eIF4E relocates to polysomes during MNV1 infection. mRNA, and other mRNAs previously proposed to be controlled by p-eIF4E (SRp20, CDK9, Casp4, rpS19, and rpL32) using RT-qPCR, we measured the abundance of target mRNAs, in pooled polysome or non-polysome fractions. a TS of >1 represents a translational activation of a particular mRNA, whereas a TS of 1 rpS19 and rpL32 were also translationally activated. no activation was detected for CDK9, Casp4 and SRp20. p-eIF4E alone is not sufficient for translational activation. phosphorylated eIF4E is detected only in polysomal fractions from MNV1-infected lysates. polysome run-off was induced as indicated using EDTA. the change in TS has been calculated using the formula, (mock/MNV1)poly/(mock/MNV1)mono, where (mock/MNV1)poly and (mock/MNV1)mono represent the changes of individual mRNAs in polysomal and monosomal RNA, respectively. the VPg protein of caliciviruses acts as a proteinaceous cap substitute to initiate translation by interacting with eIF4E both in vitro and a different inhibitor of the eIF4E-eIF4G interaction has been shown to induce eIF2 phosphorylation, leading to decreased translation independently from its effect on eIF4E. we then measured the effect of 4E2RCat on MNV1 replication by infecting RAW264.7 cells at an MOI of 0.3 TCID50/cell with MNV1. a percentage of the DMSO control set to 100% and normalized to the eIF4E pull-down efficacy. the results were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance with Dunnett's multiple comparisons test. the formation of a complex between eIF4E and eIF4G is also important for the regulation of eIF4E phosphorylation (31, 48). phosphorylation occurs only when eIF4E is complexed with eIF4G because Mnk1/2 lack the ability to bind eIF4E directly. level of p-eIF4E increased from 1 to 1.56 and 1.98 when compared with mock infection. eIF4E phosphorylation via MAPK signaling pathways is important for MNV1 replication. the addition of 10 or 20 m CGP57380 impaired MNV1 replication. eIF4E phosphorylation by Mnk1 is important for MNV1 replication. lysates were harvested at 2 and 12 hpi and analyzed. p38 and ERK1/2 can activate Mnk1 to regulate the phosphorylation of eIF4E. at both 2 and 12 hpi, ERK1 and ERK2 are activated during MNV1 infection. we used chemical inhibitors of p38 and ERK1/2 kinase activity. addition of SB203580 resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of eIF4E phosphorylation and MNV1 titer. the addition of SCH772984 also impaired the phosphorylation of eIF4E. however, we could not detect any significant effect on MNV1 replication upon ERK1/2 inhibition. the results were analyzed using ImageJ software. the spots were normalized to control spots on the arrays. values for relative phosphorylation (activation) of the ERK and p38 isoforms are presented. p-eIF4E regulates interferon production by controlling translation of mRNAs. cell lysates from mock- or MNV1-infected cells were prepared and subjected to a 10\u201350% sucrose gradient centrifugation. p-eIF4E is involved in the translational control of specific mRNAs involved in cell survival and inflammation. al subunits is no longer engaged in mRNA translation during MNV1 infection. we analyzed the association of p-eIF4E with translationally active polysomes. p-eIF4E was associated with polysomal fractions from MNV1-infected cells. the abundance of target mRNAs was normalized to an added-in exogenous RNA control. a TS of >1 represents a translational activation of a particular mRNA. this could correlate with the relocation of p-eIF4E to polysome fractions. lysates from mock-infected or MNV1-infected cells were prepared as detailed under \u201cExperimental Procedures\u201d following 8 h of infection. lysates from mock-infected or MNV1-infected cells were prepared as detailed under \u201cExperimental Procedures\u201d following 8 h of infection. total RNAs were isolated from the pooled translationally active polysomal fraction and inactive free fraction of mock- or MNV1-infected cell lysates. PCR amplification was carried out using a Transcriptor first strand cDNA synthesis kit. caliciviruses acts as a proteinaceous cap substitute to initiate translation by interacting with eIF4E both in vitro and in vivo. however, it plays little to no role in MNV translation in vitro or in murine microglial cells. 4E2RCat has been identified as an eIF4E-eIF4G inhibitor with an IC50 of 13.5 m. eIF4E-eIF4G interaction is important for calicivirus replication. cell viability expressed as percentage of DMSO control set to 100%. efficacy of eIF4G pull-down is expressed as a percentage of DMSO control set to 100%. 264.7 cells were pretreated for 1 h with 10\u201325 m 4E2RCat or 30 min with 0.5 mm sodium arsenite (Ars) the cells were subsequently infected at an MOI of 0.3 TCID50/cell with MNV1. phosphorylation of eIF4E occurs only when eIF4E is complexed with eIF4G. several viral infections induce accumulation of phosphorylated eIF4E. other infections can lead to eIF4E dephosphorylation (20) eIF4E phosphorylation via MAPK signaling pathways is important for MNV1 replication. lysates from mock and MNV1-infected RAW264.7 cells at 2 or 12 hpi were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immmunoblotting. the addition of 10 or 20 m CGP57380 impaired MNV1 replication. eIF4E phosphorylation by Mnk1 is important for MNV1 replication. lysates were harvested at 2 and 12 hpi. ERK1 and ERK2 are activated during MNV1 infection. the main p38 isoform, p38, shows strong activation during MNV1 infection. p38 and p38 showed no significant change. p38 selectively targets Mnk1 (50) although both upstream kinases ERK and p38 are activated, only the activation of p38 is required for MNV1 replication. the addition of SCH772984 did prevent eIF4E phosphorylation during infection. o\u00ae luminescent cell viability assay (Promega) results show the means S.E. (error bars) from three separate experiments. D, RAW264.7 cells were treated with the same range of concentrations of inhibitor as used for the viability assay with SB203580. p-eIF4E regulates interferon production by controlling translation of Nfkbia mRNA, thereby modulating sensitivity to viral infections (33). a recent study showed that p-eIF4E could play a role during MNV1 infection by altering the translation of a subset of mRNAs. p-eIF4E was associated with polysomal fractions from MNV1-infected cells. the association of p-eIF4E with polysomes was impaired when run-off of polysomes was induced with EDTA. results suggest that p-eIF4E relocates to polysomes during MNV1 infection. a TS of >1 represents a translational activation of a particular mRNA. a TS of 1 represents translational repression. previous studies have demonstrated that the translational activation of Nfkbia mRNA is dependent on p-eIF4E. this in turn impairs interferon production by up-regulating the translation of the NF-B inhibitor IB. a normalized (by A254) amount of lysate was separated on a 10\u201350% sucrose gradient and fractionated into 1-ml fractions. the displayed trace represents absorbance at 254 nm (vertical axis) throughout the gradient from top (left) to bottom (right) PCR amplification was carried out using a Transcriptor first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Roche Applied Science) total RNAs were isolated from the translationally active polysomal fraction and inactive free fraction of mock- or MNV1-infected cell lysates and subjected to reverse transcription using a transcriptor first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Roche Applied Science) eIF4E-eIF4G interaction with eIF4G affects MNV1 replication. eIF4E-eIF4G interaction has no effect on MNV1 replication. eIF4E-eIF4G interaction has been shown to be important for the replication of some viruses. eIF4E inhibitor 4E-binding proteins, 4E-BPs, limits the phosphorylation of eIF4E. phosphorylation of serine 209 mediates eIF4E phosphorylation during infection. p-eIF4E can stimulate translation of specific mRNAs. mRNAs involved in proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis. loss of eIF4E phosphorylation in cells expressing mutant S209A is associated with impaired translation of the Nfkbia mRNA, which encodes the NF-B inhibitor IB. the expression of the Nfkbia mRNA was up-regulated during infection. other p-eIF4E-sensitive mRNAs, rpS19 and rpL32, were translationally activated. this would support a model in which additional factors, like RNA-binding proteins or microRNAs, would contribute to the translational activation of p-eIF4E-sensitive mRNAs in a specific biological context. phosphorylation of eIF4E negatively regulates interferon production. human astrovirus activates ERK1/2 and inhibition of MEK1/2 impairs viral replication. p-eIF4E plays a key role during MNV1 replication. 4G-bound eIF4E requires the interaction of Mnk1/2 with eIF4G (48) this would explain why both the eIF4E-eIF4G interaction and the activation of the MAPK signaling pathways are required for MNV1 replication. the association of phosphorylated eIF4E with actively translating ribosomes during MNV infection could facilitate the translation of as yet unidentified cellular mRNAs."}
