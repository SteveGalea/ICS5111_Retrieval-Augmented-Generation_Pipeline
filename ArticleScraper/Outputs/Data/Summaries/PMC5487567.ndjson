{"summary": "type I IFNs are potent inhibitors of viral replication. they act as such by promoting apoptosis of infected cells. they act as such by stimulating surrounding cells to induce transcription of IFN-related genes. negative regulatory molecules restrain activity of IRF3 via proteasomal degradation or dephosphorylation. some negative regulatory molecules restrain activity via proteasomal degradation or dephosphorylation. Rubicon specifically interacts with IRF3 and this interaction leads to inhibition of the dimerization of IRF3. RESULTS Knockdown of Rubicon increases type I IFN secretion and inhibits viral replication. control and Rubicon knockdown RAW 264.7 cells were exposed to poly(IC) and 5\u2032-triphosphate double-stranded RNA (5\u2032ppp-dsRNA) and IFN- and IL-6 secretion was measured by ELISA. the results demonstrate that Rubicon negatively regulates virus-induced IFN- production in RAW264.7 cells. 93T cells obtained by transfection of Rubicon-specific siRNA showed lower Rubicon expression levels than control cells. hek293T cells were then infected with PR8-GFP. rubicon knockdown also reduced poly(IC)-induced production of IFN- and IL-6. rubicon expression in BMDMs transfected with control siRNA (lane 1; BMDM-Scramble) or Rubicon siRNA (lane 2; BMDM-si-Rubicon) was measured by immunoblotting. -Actin was used to confirm equal loading of proteins. the data are representative of the results of at least two independent experiments. overexpression of Rubicon inhibits type I IFN secretion and increases viral replication. overexpression of Rubicon inhibits type I IFN secretion and increases viral replication. overexpression of Rubicon was confirmed by immunoblotting of HEK293T cells stably transfected with an IRES vector (lane 1; RAW-Control) or Rubicon-Flag (lane 2; RAW-Rubicon). -Actin was used to confirm equal loading of proteins. the data are representative of the results of at least two independent experiments. Rubicon inhibits type I IFN signaling and transcription of IFN-related genes. expression of mRNA-encoding IFN and IFN-related genes was higher in Rubicon knockdown RAW264.7 cells than in control cells. the results indicate that suppressed and enhanced antiviral responses were related to overexpression and knockdown of Rubicon. this in turn means that Rubicon acts as a negative regulator of the type I IFN signaling pathway and inhibits transcription of IFN and IFN-related genes. luciferase assays were performed by stimulating type I IFN signaling. first, we transfected cells with an IFN- luciferase reporter plasmid. we stimulated type I IFN signaling by overexpression of downstream molecules. Rubicon inhibits IFN- promoter activity induced by virus and IRF3-mediated type I IFN signaling molecules. HEK293 cells were transfected with an IFN- reporter plasmid and increasing amounts of a Rubicon plasmid. the cells were then infected with PR8-GFP (MOI = 3) or stimulated with poly(IC) (20 g/ml) at 24 h posttransfection. control and Rubicon-overexpressing HEK293T cells were transfected with GFP-tagged IRF3. the percentage of cells containing IRF3 in the nucleus increased to 80% at 16 hpi. rubicon-Flag was then detected by an anti-Flag antibody. lysates of HEK293 cells transfected with control vector (IRES-Flag or PCMV-HA) were subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-Flag antibody, followed by immunoblotting with an anti-HA antibody. WCL were immunoblotted with anti-Flag and -GFP antibodies. Rubicon-IRF3 was immunoprecipitated and then detected by immunoblotting. cells were cotransfected with flag-tagged RIG-I, TRIF, TRAF3 or NLRX1. phosphorylated IRF3 was then detected by immunoblotting at indicated times. we induced phosphorylation of IRF3 by overexpressing TBK1. we then examined the inhibitory effect of Rubicon on IRF3 dimerization. the results showed that Rubicon interacted with GST-IAD, but not with GST-DBD. IRF3 dimerization in Rubicon knockdown and -overexpressing cells was higher than that in control RAW 264.7 cells. overexpression of Rubicon in HEK293T and RAW 264.7 cells almost completely blocked IRF3 dimerization. competition assays were performed by coexpressing GST-IRF3 and GFP-IRF7 proteins. TBK1-Flag and HA-IRF3 were coexpressed in HEK293T cells. increasing levels of Rubicon-Myc were overexpressed in HEK293T cells. lysates were then resolved in native polyacrylamide gels. Immunoprecipitation of GST-IRF3 from the cell lysates was conducted in a GST pulldown assay. WCL were immunoblotted with anti-HA, -Flag, and -GST antibodies. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with control vector (PCMV-GFP), GFP-IRF7, HA-IRF3, and increasing doses of Rubicon-Flag plasmids. Knockdown of Rubicon increases type I IFN secretion and inhibits viral replication. rubicon knockdown led to increased levels of IFN- and IL-6. control and Rubicon knockdown RAW 264.7 cells were exposed to poly(IC) and 5\u2032-triphosphate double-stranded RNA (5\u2032ppp-dsRNA) and IL-6 secretion was measured by ELISA. Rubicon knockdown HEK293T cells showed lower Rubicon expression levels than control cells. hek293T cells were then infected with PR8-GFP. knockdown also reduced poly(IC)-induced production of IFN- and IL-6 in HEK293T cells. BMDM-Scramble and BMDM-si-Rubicon cells were measured by ELISA at 12 and 24 hpi. rubicon expression in BMDMs transfected with control siRNA (lane 1; BMDM-Scramble) or Rubicon siRNA (lane 2; BMDM-si-Rubicon) was measured by immunoblotting. the data are representative of the results of at least two independent experiments. overexpression of Rubicon inhibits type I IFN secretion and increases viral replication. results suggest overexpression of Rubicon inhibits type I IFN secretion. overexpression of Rubicon was confirmed by immunoblotting of HEK293T cells transfected with an IRES vector (lane 1; RAW-Control) or Rubicon-Flag (lane 2; RAW-Rubicon). -Actin was used to confirm equal loading of proteins. levels of IFN- and IL-6 in the supernatants were measured by ELISA. the data are representative of the results of at least two independent experiments. Rubicon inhibits type I IFN signaling and transcription of IFN-related genes. expression of mRNA-encoding IFN and IFN-related genes was higher in Rubicon knockdown RAW264.7 cells than in control cells. the results indicate that suppressed and enhanced antiviral responses were related to overexpression and knockdown of Rubicon. rubicon inhibits the type I IFN signaling pathway and inhibits expression of IFN-related genes. luciferase assays were performed by stimulating type I IFN signaling with several stimulants and proteins. first, we transfected cells with an IFN- luciferase reporter plasmid and stimulated them with PR8-GFP or poly(IC)-mediated IFN- promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner. Rubicon inhibits IFN- promoter activity induced by virus and IRF3-mediated type I IFN signaling molecules. HEK293 cells were transfected with an IFN- reporter plasmid and increasing amounts of a Rubicon plasmid. the cells were then infected with PR8-GFP (MOI = 3) or stimulated with poly(IC) (20 g/ml) at 24 h posttransfection. control and Rubicon-overexpressing HEK293T cells were transfected with a virus. the percentage of cells containing IRF3 in the nucleus increased to 80% at 16 hpi. rubicon-Flag was then detected by an anti-Flag antibody. HEK293 cells were cotransfected with the control vector (IRES-Flag or PCMV-HA) and Rubicon-Flag and HA-IRF3 plasmids. lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody, followed by immunoblotting with an anti-HA antibody. WCL were then immunoblotted with anti-Flag and -HA antibodies. hemagglutinin (HA)-IRF3 was immunoprecipitated and then detected by immunoblotting with an anti-IRF3 antibody. a band corresponding to IRF3 was detected. cells were cotransfected with flag-tagged RIG-I, TRIF, TRAF3 or NLRX1. Rubicon overexpression had no effect on IRF3 phosphorylation. we examined the inhibitory effect of Rubicon on IRF3 dimerization. the results showed that Rubicon interacted with GST-IAD, but not with GST-DBD. IRF3 dimerization in Rubicon knockdown and -overexpressing cells was higher than that in control RAW 264.7 cells. overexpression of Rubicon in HEK293T and RAW 264.7 cells almost completely blocked IRF3 dimerization. competition assays were performed by coexpressing GST-IRF3 and GFP-IRF7 proteins, along with increasing amounts of Rubicon-Flag. control (Scramble) and Rubicon knockdown (sh-Rubicon) RAW264.7 cells were infected with PR8-GFP (MOI = 2) and harvested at the indicated times (0, 2, 4, 8, and 16 hpi) TBK1-Flag and HA-IRF3 were coexpressed, along with increasing levels of Rubicon-Myc, in HEK293T cells. IRF3, or GST-IRF3, was coexpressed with increasing levels of Rubicon-Flag in HEK293T cells. immunoprecipitation of GST-IRF3 from the cell lysates was conducted in a GST pulldown assay. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with control vector (PCMV-GFP), GFP-IRF7, HA-IRF3, and increasing doses of Rubicon-Flag plasmids. DISCUSSION Rubicon engages the Beclin-1/Vps34-PI3K/UVRAG complex and inhibits the fusion of endosomes and autophagosomes with lysosomes. rubicon interacts with IRF3 and the IAD of IRF3 blocks translocation of IRF3 into the nucleus. this interaction leads to inhibition of the dimerization of IRF3 and blocks the translocation of IRF3 into the nucleus. this interaction leads to inhibition of the dimerization of IRF3 and blocks the translocation of IRF3 into the nucleus. viruses can also inhibit IRF3 activation to defend themselves against host type I IFN responses. severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus PLpro interacts with IRF3 to prevent its phosphorylation. bovine herpesvirus bICP0, rotavirus NSP1 and classical swine fever virus Npro target IRF3 for proteasomal degradation. Rubicon inhibits dimerization of IRF3 by binding to IRF7. IRF7 is highly homologous with IRF3 and is known as a key regulator of type I IFN gene expression upon virus infection. Rubicon acts as a negative regulator of type I IFN signaling by inhibiting the dimerization and nuclear translocation of IRF7. the novel cellular molecule inhibits dimerization of IRF3 or IRF3/IRF7. this could contribute to understanding of negative regulatory mechanisms acting on the type I IFN pathway to maintain cellular homeostasis. bone marrow was differentiated into BMDMs with 10% FBS DMEM and 10 ng/ml granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) all animal experiments were managed in strict accordance with the Guide for the care and use of laboratory animals. plasmids (psPAX2 and pMD2.VSV-G, purchased from Addgene) were transfected into HEK293T cells using Lipofectamine 2000. after 72 h, virus-containing supernatants were collected and used to infect RAW264.7 cells with 8 g/ml Polybrene (Sigma) after filtration (0.45-m filter; Millipore) this lentivirus has the ability to express GFP in extracellular virus was removed and replaced with 10% FBS DMEM. supernatants of growing cells or freeze-thawed cells were used for titration of VSV-GFP or PR8-GFP.
