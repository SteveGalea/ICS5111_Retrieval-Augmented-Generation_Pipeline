{"summary": "swab types (1, 6, 9, 10) and transport medium (7) optimal for identification of viruses. but often they do not assess variables such as transit times and holding temperatures between sample collection and testing. wabs with amies gel containing charcoal (catalogue E114) were prepared in minimum essential medium (MEM) containing 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco, Auckland, New Zealand) were immersed in the virus for 2 s. those with associated transport media were immediately placed in that medium. cDNA was linearized at 65\u00b0C for 10 min, quenched on ice, added to 12 l reverse transcription master mix. PCR used 4 l DNA and 16 l ABI Fast master mix containing primers at 0.9 M and probes at 0.2 M. CT values obtained for influenza virus under the conditions evaluated are shown. the difference between dry swabs held at 4\u00b0C and those at 37\u00b0C was statistically significant (P 0.001). a CT of 45 indicates a result was not detected for both replicates. each of the swab/transport medium combinations produced an amplifiable enterovirus, HSV-2, or adenovirus product. dry swabs used for clinical sampling showed utility for several respiratory viruses, although no direct comparison was made. we did not evaluate the impact of swabs, transport media, or transport conditions on virus isolation."}
