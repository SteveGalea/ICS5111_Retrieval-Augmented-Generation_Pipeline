{"summary": "lycorine, littoraline, hippeastrine, lycorenine, tazettine, pretazettine, macronine, homolycorine, lycoramine, vittatine, and haemanthamine are known to exhibit a wide range of pharmacological activities. lycorine, a pyrrolophenanthridine alkaloid, is one of the major alkaloids found in H. littoralis [ in vitro propagation is an important tool for rapid multiplication of medicinal plants [17, 18] as well as for the production of secondary metabolites. the number of wild plants will not be effected due to overharvesting of the respective plants. the medicinal properties of a plant can be retained or increased via in vitro techniques. standard lycorine was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA) methanol used for extraction and HPLC grade acetonitrile and methanol used for analysis were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) 2,4-D and BAP were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, USA) plant, callus culture samples were obtained via tissue culture method. for each concentration, four explants were cultured on the semisolid MS medium in a single culture jar (59 mm 66 mm) it was repeated three times which made up to a total of 16 replicates. the working standard solutions at different concentrations were injected into HPLC from the highest to the lowest concentrations. the concentration with the smallest detectable peak, at a noise-to-signal ratio of 3, was taken as the limit of detection. the lowest concentration with acceptable accuracy and precision at noise-to-signal ratio of 8 was taken as the limit of quantification. samples were filtered through 0.45 m syringe filter and kept in fridge at 20\u00b0C prior to HPLC analysis. lycorine was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA) the stock solution was then diluted with methanol in twofold (50 g/mL) dilutions to obtain a series of working standard solutions. all working standard solutions were stored in freezer at 20\u00b0C prior to analysis. temperature of 25 2\u00b0C using methanol as the solvent (plant materials-solvent ratio of 1 : 5 to 1 : 10) after filtration, the filtrates were dried using a rotary evaporator (Buchi, Switzerland) at 40\u00b0C to obtain the respective extracts. dried callus was then powdered using a mortar and pestle and extracted by sonication method. the working standard solutions at different concentrations were injected into HPLC from the highest to the lowest concentrations. the concentration with the smallest detectable peak, at a noise-to-signal ratio of 3, was taken as the limit of detection. the lowest concentration with acceptable accuracy and precision at noise-to-signal ratio of 8 was taken as the limit of quantification. the second part involved the quantification of the compound lycorine in callus extracts produced by using different combinations and concentrations of plant growth regulators (PGRs) samples were then filtered through a 0.45 m syringe filter and kept in fridge at 20\u00b0C prior to HPLC analysis. acetic acid or formic acid was added into the mobile phase to suppress the ionization of the compounds. aqueous phase was replaced with 10 mM of phosphate buffer or 1% ammonium acetate buffer. the mobile phase chosen for the subsequent analysis was acetonitrile-1% ammonium acetate (15 : 85 v/v) lycorine in H. littoralis wild plant and tissue culture extracts was compared to previous methods reported on analysis. the present method had a lower LOQ compared to previous methods reported on analysis of lycorine. the contents of lycorine in extracts of callus samples were calculated using external standard method. the wild plant extract and callus (initiated from 4.5 M 2,4-D alone and 9.00 M 2,4-D with 4.5 M BAP combination) were statistically analyzed. lycorine absorbed maximum UV wavelength at 325 nm, which was selected as detection wavelength. the wavelength selected differs from previous reports which ranged between 287 and 292 nm [2, 7, 14]. acetic acid ranging from 0.25 to 1% and formic acid ranging from 0.25 to 0.5% were added into the mobile phase. the aqueous phase was replaced with 10 mM of phosphate buffer or 1% ammonium acetate buffer. the mobile phase chosen for the subsequent analysis was acetonitrile-1% ammonium acetate (15 : 85 v/v) lycorine was calculated using external standard method and summarized in Table 2. the contents of lycorine in extracts of callus samples are given in Table 3. the wild plant extract and callus (initiated from 4.5 M 2,4-D alone and 9.00 M 2,4-D with 4.5 M B) there was significant production of lycorine in the extracts of different parts of H. littoralis wild plant. the highest content of lycorine was found in the extracts of all different parts of H. littoralis. study of extracts of callus culture of H. littoralis revealed some interesting findings. lycorine content increased when the amount of 2,4-D was increased from 2.25 to 4.50 M. callus culture may be supplemented with only 4.50 M 2,4-D or a combination of 9.00 M 2,4-D with 4.5 M BAP to obtain a good yield of lycorine. this may be due to the effect of plant growth regulators (PGRs) such as the auxin and cytokinin used herein. lycorine production in initiated callus at 4.5 M 2,4-D alone and 9.00 M 2,4-D with combination of 4.5 M BAP is not significantly different. this indicates that the callus formed from these 2 different plant growth regulators is having high amount of lycorine compared to wild type plant. authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding publication of this paper."}
