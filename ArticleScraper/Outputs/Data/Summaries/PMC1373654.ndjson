{"summary": "fluorescently labeled Oligo DNA probes were prepared for multiple nucleic acid templates. the precipitate emitted fluorescence corresponding to the amplified nucleic acid templates can be detected easily by naked eye on a conventional UV illuminator. LAMP is considered to be effective as a gene amplification method for use in gene point-of-care testing (g-POCT) devices. first, since LAMP can amplify genes isothermally, the amplification reaction can be carried out with a simple heater. this characteristic greatly facilitates detection of the LAMP reaction. probes (probe F and probe B, respectively) can hybridize to the loop segment. as the cycle reaction progresses, an elongation and recycling step takes place. elongated products (8, 13, etc.) with an inverted repeat structure are generated. we investigated whether it was possible to perform bound/free separation of fluorescently labeled probes. we report the novel visual detection methods of the presence of sequences of HBV and HCV cloned to plasmid as a model experiment. structure 11, which is a complementary strand of structure 6, is generated. this means that an auto cycle reaction was established between structure 6 and structure 11. products bound by an inverted repeat with two amplified regions, like structures 8 and 13, are generated in association with the auto cycle reaction. precipitate with no fluorescence was obtained, and visible precipitate was not generated in a sample not containing a template. the amplification method is so sensitive that it is possible to create an amplification reaction from only six copies of template nucleic acid [1]. oligo DNA probes labeled with fluorescent dye hybridize to a specific LAMP product. when an optimized amount of PEI is added, the positive charge of PEI neutralizes the negative charge of the DNA to form an insoluble LAMP product-PEI complex. when the precipitation titration progresses, the probe will sequentially hybridize to the loop segment generated during the reaction. probes unrelated to the sequence of the amplified LAMP product are not taken up by the LAMP-PEI complex because they are not hybridized to the LAMP product. oligo DNA probes and PEI cannot interact sufficiently to form an insoluble complex. therefore, unrelated probes remain in the supernatant. 0.4 mol to 0.8 mol of PEI was added as a monomer. however, the amount of precipitate in this case was so small that it was impossible to confirm it visually. almost all of the PEI molecules added were consumed in the precipitation of unrelated LAMP products. effect of the Mw of PEI on sequence-specific incorporation of ROX-labeled lambda DNA recognition probes by DNA-PEI complex increased from 1,800 to 10,000. the fluorescence intensity of supernatant decreased in the absence of a LAMP reaction since the formation of insoluble PEI-oligo DNA probe complex occurred. solution with specific amplification (lambda DNA) is lower than that with unrelated amplification (PSA) as the Mw of PEI increased, however, almost all probes in LAMP reaction negative solution formed an insoluble PEI-oligo DNA complex. this result means that the LAMP reaction negative solution cannot be distinguished from the LAMP reaction positive solution, which successfully amplifies the targeting sequence if PEI with a high molecular weight is used. this finding is further indication that this detection method is based on neutralization of the negative electric charge of DNA by the positive electric charge of PEI. the effect of ionic strength on the LAMP reaction has been investigated and found that the presence of 200 mM or more of KCl markedly delayed the LAMP reaction. this detection method will function without trouble if the solution used has a composition optimized for the LAMP reaction. spacer of few thymidines was inserted between F1c or B1c and F2 or B2 in the inner primer (FIP or BIP) the spacer was not used in this study because the LAMP reaction can progress with the use of inner primers without the spacer. the starting structure (structure 6) is generated from the template nucleic acid in the starting material production step. this characteristic of the LAMP reaction plays an important role in the detection method described here. a combination of LAMP amplification and this detection method makes possible sequence-specific visual presentation of the presence of trace amounts of nucleic acid. a sequence-specific visual detection method uses precipitation titration of LAMP products by adding PEI. results of sequence-specific visual detection after adding PEI to solution. fluorescently labeled probes hybridized to LAMP products are taken up by the LAMP product-PEI complex together with the LAMP products. when the generated insoluble complex is pelletized by centrifugation and the pellet is irradiated with excitation light, the labeled fluorescent dye hybridized to LAMP products produces fluorescence. oligo DNA probes for lambda DNA were captured in the precipitate. 0.2 to 1 mol of PEI was added to 25 L of LAMP reaction solution. when the amount of PEI is too low, the PEI-DNA complex becomes anionic. the amount of PEI added was fixed at 0.2 mol for the following experiments. 0.2 mol to 1.0 mol of PEI was added as a monomer. almost 100% of labeled probes hybridized to the LAMP products for lambda DNA was taken up by the DNA-PEI complex. normal LAMP reaction solution (control) contains 10 mM of KCI. effect of amount of LAMP product for lambda DNA on sequence-specific incorporation of ROX-labeled lambda DNA recognition probe by LAMP product-PEI complex. we conducted a similar experiment using spermine, which is a polyamine with a lower molecular weight. in that experiment, an adequate amount of insoluble complex was not generated compared with PEI of an average molecular weight of 600. it is well known that spermine can also make DNA insoluble, as indicated in many other reports. system was sensitive enough to be used in simple g-POCT devices. all of the 1 pmol of probe added hybridized to 1 g (= 3 nmol nucleotide) of LAMP product. one molecule of probe bound to every 1,500 base pairs of LAMP products. this finding reflects well the fundamental characteristic of this reaction. this detection method effectively utilizes the characteristics of the LAMP method. a large amount of amplification product can be synthesized in a short time while maintaining high specificity. the amount of the amplification product is large means that the range of the optimum amount of PEI necessary to generate the insoluble complex is wide. we tried carrying out the BF separation using chilled ethanol. since the addition of chilled ethanol lowered the temperature of the LAMP solution, there was a strong tendency for nonspecific probes to weakly hybridize to LAMP products and precipitate. therefore, low-molecular-weight PEI, which is efficiently insolubilizes amplicons with only a small amount, is the best option for high BF separation. genetic testing is kept within the walls of specific institutions or university laboratories with special equipment and trained engineers. the combination of the LAMP method and the new detection method described here can overcome several factors that have prevented true practical application of super-simple g-POCT devices for genetic testing. lambda DNA solution (Takara
