{"summary": "the majority of FCoV infections are asymptomatic or are associated with mild enteric disease. however, approximately 5-12% of infected cats develop the invariably fatal disease, feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) 1058L substitution distinguished 4% of FIP from non-FIP associated FCoVs in 92% of cases. a second substitution distinguished 4% of FIP from non-FIP associated FCoVs. it is reasonable to think that amino acid substitutions within this peptide may alter the tropism of the virus. the university of Bristol has collected a large number of post-mortem tissue and faecal samples from a cohort of thoroughly examined cats. these include cats with a definite diagnosis of FIP, confirmed by the presence of the typical histological FIP lesions. this long-term study has enabled both faecal and tissue samples to be collected from cat with and without FIP. the tissues collected comprised primarily mesenteric lymph node, liver, kidney, spleen and omentum. other tissues (e.g. intestine, brain, lung, pericardium, pancreas or other lymph nodes) were included. the formalin-fixed tissue samples were subjected to standard processing for histopathology. nine microlitres of total RNA solution were combined with 4 L ImProm II 5 Reaction Buffer, 2.4 L 25 mM MgCl2, 1 L dNTPs (10 mM each), 1 L random hexamers (0.5 g/L) and 1 L ImProm II reverse transcriptase. the reaction was made up to a total volume of 20 L with RNase-free water. randomly selected samples were checked for inhibition using an RNA internal ACTACTGCCACRGGAT 26655..26674 P010 qPCR reverse primer GGAAGGTTCATCTCCCCAGT 26826..26802 CAACGC-BHQ-1 F614 Forward pyrosequencing primer GCHCARTATTAYAATGGCAT 23436..23460 AATGG R766 Biotinylated reverse pyrosequencing primer BIO-AAGYCTRGCYTGYACT 23588.. qRT-PCR was done using a MJ Mini Gradient Thermal Cycler. a PCR mix was made that included 12.5 L 2 GoTaq Master Mix, 0.5 L of 10 M forward and reverse primer (F614/R766), 2 L of randomly primed cDNA reaction products and water to a volume of 25 L. control oligonucleotide (a self-sequencing oligonucleotide) mix contained 0.75 L 10 M oligonucleotide C4 and 24.25 L annealing buffer (Qiagen) twenty five microlitres of the sequencing primer mix was added to the appropriate wells of a pyrosequencing plate. all primers used in the pyrosequencing assay were designed using a combination of PyroMark assay design software (Qiagen), Primer 3\u2019 software [23] and MFold [24]. the primer positions were based on those used by Chang et al. [13], and numbered according to the FCoV C1Je genome [GenBank:DQ848678]. a non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test was compared between the FIP and non-FIP samples for tissue and faecal samples combined, for faecal samples only, and for tissue samples only. the findings were in full agreement, so the simpler Mann-Whitney U test analysis is presented here. formalin-fixed tissue samples were subjected to standard processing for histopathology. they were embedded in paraffin wax and sections prepared and stained by haematoxylin-eosin. sections were examined by a board-certified veterinary pathologist at the university of Bristol. the reaction was made up to a total volume of 20 L with RNase-free water. the following thermal profile was used; 20 \u00b0C for 5 min, 42 \u00b0C for 30 min, 70 \u00b0C for 15 min and 4 \u00b0C hold. the resulting 20 L of cDNA was added to 30 L of RNase-free water and stored at -20 \u00b0C.

[13], and numbered according to the FCoV C1Je genome. the location of the primers optimised, based upon a sequence alignment comprised of all available type I FCoV genomes copy numbers were compared between the FIP and non-FIP samples for tissue and faecal samples combined, for faecal samples only, and for tissue samples only. the project has been approved under ethical review by the university of Bristol Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Board (VIN/14/013) non FIP 52 Faeces None Not applicable Tissue Noneg Not applicable Non FIP 54 Faeces None Not applicable Nonec Not applicable Nonec Not applicable Non FIP 56 Tissue 35.9b UUG (Leu) Noned Not applicable Nonec Not applicable Nonec Not applicable Non FIP 59 Faeces 33.6 AUG (Met) Tissue Noneb Not applicable Non FIP 60 Faeces 35.6 AUG (Met)/CUG (Leu) Tissue Noneb Not applicable Non FIP UUG (Leu) FIP 36 Tissue 31.1l UUG (Leu) FIP 37 Faeces 15.8 AUG (Met) Tissue 16.2o AUG (Met)2 FIP 42 Faeces 19.9 AUG (Met) Tissue 20.4l UUG (Leu) 21.6b UUG (Leu) FIP 43 Tissue 24.1a CUG (Leu) FIP 44 Faeces 30.0 AUG (Met) Tissue 19.0p UUG (Le 33.1b UUG (Leu) 34.0j UUG (Leu) 36.9d UUG (Leu) FIP 70 Faeces None Not applicable Tissue 23.3b AUG (Met)1 30.3l AUG (Met)1 31.0j UUG (Leu) Tissue types are defined by superscripts: 1UCU (Ser) and 2GCU (Ala) 44 347; 0-16 547 217) were significantly higher (U = 241.0, P 0.001) than in the non-FIP group (0, 0-10 090) relative copy numbers in the FIP group were also significantly higher than those in the non-FIP group (0-2 146) the peaks represent a sequence of GCCTTGGG. the relative peak heights suggest that the methionine and leucine encoding RNAs were present in approximately equal amounts. ine codon was found in all 6 faecal samples from cats without FIP. 1 sample in 1 cat had a leucine codon (1/6; 17%, which also had a methionine as a mixed infection) no mixed infections were found in tissue samples. a leucine codon was found in the majority (8/9; 89%) of tissue samples from cats without FIP. a minority (1/9; 11%) had a methionine codon. a total of 26 faecal samples were analysed by FCoV qRT-PCR. relative copy numbers in pooled faecal and tissue samples in the FIP group were significantly higher than those in the non-FIP group (0, 0-10 090) relative copy numbers in pooled faecal and tissue samples in the FIP group were significantly higher than those in the non-FIP group (0, 0-2 146) faeces showed a mixed population of RNA coding for either methionine (AUG) or leucine (CUG) at this position. peaks represent a sequence of GCCTTGGG. a methionine codon was identified in 6 samples from 6 cats without FIP. 1 sample in 1 cat had a leucine codon (1/6; 17%, which also had a methionine as a mixed infection) ine codons were identified in RNA from tissue samples from both cats with and without FIP. a leucine codon was identified in 39 samples from 23 FIP cats. a methionine codon was identified in 4 samples from 2 faeces. the peaks represent a sequence of GCCTTGGG. the relative peak heights suggest that the methionine and leucine encoding RNAs were present in approximately equal amounts. ecal samples from cats without FIP and 1 sample in 1 cat had a leucine codon (1/6; 17%, which also had a methionine as a mixed infection) a leucine codon (44 UUG, 3 CUG) alone was found at position 1058. a leucine codon was found in the majority (8/9; 89%) of tissue samples from 6 cats without FIP. a minority (1/9; 11%) had a methionine codon. a significant number (9%) of tissue samples had a methionine codon at this position. we believe that the M1058L substitution is more likely to be a marker of systemic FCoV infection, as opposed to a marker of FIP or the development of disease. we cannot exclude the possibility that the 6 cats without FIP would have gone on to develop FIP if they had not been euthanized due to other reasons. IHC, a detection method of low sensitivity, did not detect FCoV antigen anywhere in the PCR-positive tissues from cats without FIP. findings are in accordance with recent in vivo and in vitro studies that showed only the virulent form of FCoV can effectively and sustainably replicate in monocytes [9,28,29] 77%) of faecal samples from cats with FIP had a methionine codon at position 1058 in the FCoV S protein gene. it seems reasonable to suggest that these cats were infected with an enteric, and a systemic, virulent form of the virus. it has been proposed that the severe immune dysregulation in cats with end-stage FIP might create an opportunity for super-infection by enteric FCoV circulating in surrounding carriers. a faecal sample from a cat without FIP showed a mixed population of RNAs encoding for either methionine or leucine at position 1058. there was no evidence of FCoV RNA in the single tissue sample taken from cat 60. this interpretation could be that the M1058L substitution in the faecal sample was a relatively recent event. we have used a pyrosequencing assay to determine the distribution of a specific M1058L substitution in the S protein of FCoV RNA obtained from a large number of post-mortem tissue and faecal samples. the results contribute to a better understanding of FCoV genomic mutations and how they may, or may not, be used as markers of the virus phenotype. e, Louise Dawson and debra Fews at the Feline Centre and the Veterinary Pathology Unit, University of Bristol, have assisted in obtaining post mortem samples. we would like to thank members of the Histology Laboratory, Veterinary Laboratory Services, School of Veterinary Science and University of Liverpool for technical assistance."}
