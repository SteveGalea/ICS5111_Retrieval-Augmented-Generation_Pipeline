{"summary": "chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has re-emerged as one of the many arthropod-borne viruses that can pose serious international public health threats. CHIKV is an Alphavirus that belongs to the Togaviridae family and is transmitted mainly by two species of mosquitoes, namely, Aedes albopictus and Aedes aegypti [3]. CHIKV can be classified into three different lineages with distinct genotyp one-third of 785,000 residents of la R\u00e9union were infected with CHIKV. CHIKV-infected patients experience a sudden onset of fever of about 40 \u00b0C. arthralgia in the ankles, elbows, knees, and wrists within 2 to 12 days of infection. a significant portion of patients experience persistent and/or recurrent joint pains for months or years after contracting CHIKV [36,37]. despite the significant healthcare threat posed by the CHIKV, there are still no available vaccines or therapeutics for CHIKV infections. CHIKV is an enveloped, spherical virus with a diameter of about 60\u201370 nm. the CHIKV genome consists of a single-stranded, positive-sense, linear RNA. the 5\u2032 end of the positive-sense RNA genome possesses a 7-methylguanosine cap. the CHIKV envelope is studded with 80 sets of trimeric spikes. each spike contains three E1-E2 heterodimers, which mediate entry into host cells. the CHIKV particle is endocytosed by the host cell via the clathrin-mediated pathway. structures known as spherules are proposed to be localized near the neck of these spherules. as the infection progresses, the spherules become internalized and contribute to the formation of a membranous structure called virus-induced type 1 cytopathic vacuoles (CPV-I) the 26S subgenomic RNA encodes only the structural proteins. capsid proteins then oligomerize, packaging the viral genome into the nucleocapsid core. the capsid protein is able to recognize the full-length genomic viral RNA. the viral envelope glycoproteins (E1 and E2) have been found to be arranged in a hexagonal lattice and packed in arrays of helical tube-like structures. in the late phase of infection, another type of cytopathic vacuole called CPV-II can be observed in infected cells. the capsid proteins of CHIKV (an Old World arthritogenic alphavirus) do not seem to be involved in the shutting down of the host transcriptional processes. regions 1 (1\u201380 aa) being highly basic in nature (Arg-, Lys-, and Pro-rich) are proposed to be able to bind RNA in a non-specific manner. region 2 (81\u2013113 aa) binds specifically to the full length viral RNA genome. the CHIKV capsid protein has been reported to possess one nuclear import (NLS) and two nuclear export signals (NES) both host proteins, karyopherin (Kar) and chromosomal maintenance 1 (CRM1), have been found to be involved in the active nuclear import and export of the CHIKV capsid protein. E3 proteins carry a signal peptide (a series of polar residues) at their N-terminus. it is crucial for targeting the structural polyprotein towards the endoplasmic reticulum for initial processing. despite being only 64 amino acids long (7.4 kDa), it is necessary for the stabilization and maturation of the E2 glycoprotein. no bona fide receptor has been identified for CHIKV. however, there are host factors that have been reported to aid in viral entry. for example, prohibitin was identified to aid in the binding of CHIKV to CHME-5 microglial cells. containing proteins 1 (hTIM1) or AXL receptor tyrosine kinase (also known as UFO) promoted entry of CHIKV by at least 8-fold in HEK293T cells. this suggests that CHIKV entry is phosphatidylserine (PS)-dependent. the blocking of hTIM1 receptors was less effective in preventing CHIKV entry in Huh7 cells. TF (8.3 kDa) protein possess the same N terminus as 6 K (61 amino acids 6.6 kDa) but differs by having a shorter basic C terminus (15 residues) instead of a shorter hydrophobic C terminus found on 6 K. studies on other alphaviruses suggest these viral accessory proteins mediate membrane permeability and viral budding. nweg and colleagues performed a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening on a human brain cDNA library. the screen was able to identify 5 interacting host proteins that interact with the virus. the biological significance and exact mechanisms of the interactions have yet to be explored. CHIKV capsid protein is a compact multifunctional protein of 261 amino acids. capsid protein is made up of three main regions (regions 1, 2, and 3) [105,106] capsid protein is made up of three main regions (regions 1, 2, and 3) [105,106] the CHIKV capsid protein has been reported to possess one nuclear import (NLS) and two nuclear export signals (NES) both host proteins, karyopherin (Kar) and chromosomal maintenance 1 (CRM1), are required to be intact for CHIKV capsid to be exported. mutating the nucleolar localization sequence (NoLs) within the N-terminus results in an attenuated phenotype with smaller plaques and reduced virulence in mice while still being able to elicit an immune response. the exact location of the CHIKV capsid protein has yet to be confirmed. no other host factors that interact with the E3 protein have been reported. the CHIKV exhibits a wide tropism by being able to replicate in many invertebrate and vertebrate cells. no bona fide receptor has been identified for CHIKV. CHIKV entry is phosphatidylserine (PS)-dependent, as the PS binding deficient hTIM1 variant did not support viral entry. this suggests that the CHIKV is exposed on the membrane of the CHIKV, similar to other enveloped viruses. binding of CHIKV with soluble GAGs was found to inhibit CHIKV infection by up to 90%. only domain A was able to bind to cell-surface glycosaminoglycans-deficient cells. domain B was found to interact exclusively with cells expressing GAGs on their cell surface [132] a single mutation of Ala 226 to a valine residue on the E1 glycoprotein enhanced the dissemination of CHIKV into the secondary organs of Aedes albopictus mosquitos. this mutation coincided with the emergence of Aedes albopictus as a second transmission vector during the Indian Ocean epidemic in 2004 [15]. bone marrow stromal antigen 2 (BST-2 or tetherin or CD317) was able to restrict and trap CHIKV on the surface of the host plasma membrane by engaging the E1 glycoprotein [142] another study showed that the longer isoform of BST-2 was found to specifically block the exit of alphaviruses efficiently [143] omic RNA caps the viral RNA in a non-canonical manner. it first attaches a methyl group (hijacked from the host S-adenosyl-methionine (AdoMet) to a GTP before transferring the guanylate residue to the nsP2-processed 5\u2032 end of the viral RNA. triphosphates on the 5\u2032 end of the viral RNA need to be cleave covalent palmitoylation of the nsP1 (417\u2013419 aa) was discovered in a relatively well-studied, close alphavirus relative, the semliki forest virus. this crucial interaction allows the nsP1 to direct and anchor the replication complex to the cell plasma membrane [152]. Similarly, there is also a lack of studies on the interaction with host proteins. the subsequent two domains (168\u2013470 aa) possess characteristic RecA-like domains of superfamily 1 (SF1) group of helicases. the remaining portion (471\u2013605 aa) holds the protease domain, which can be separated into two smaller sections. the nsP2 is capable of performing at least four enzymatic functions. the last known enzymatic function is the protease activity of the nsP2. the nsP2 has been long known to enter the host nucleus during infection. nsP2 can be detected in the nuclear region at 4 h post infection (h.p.i) before translocating to the cytoplasm at a later time point. the exact mechanism of this dephosphorylation phenomenon is still unknown. nsP2 and nsP3 were also found to exhibit RNA interference activity. the promiscuous alphavirus nsP2 is able to bind to a number of host factors. nsP3 (530 amino acids, 60 kDa) protein possesses three domains, a highly conserved macro domain (160 aa), followed by a zinc2+ binding domain (165 aa) the macro domain is believed to function mainly as an ADP hydrolase that removes mono or poly ADP-ribose marks on proteins. the nsP3 is able to recognize and hydrolyse the ADP-ribose groups from mono ADP the loss of the hydrolase significantly compromised the ability of CHIKV to replicate in both baby hamster kidney and Aedes albopictus cells. CHIKV infectious clones encoding hydrolases with impaired activities were found to replicate more slowly in mouse neuronal NSC-34 cells with a significant decrease in fitness in neonate mouse model [182]. stress granules are believed to have anti-viral properties. stress granules are involved in the inhibition of RNA translation. but the depletion of the G3BPs was found to be unfavorable for CHIKV replication. the bulk of the nsP4 protein consists of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (500 aa), with the characteristic GDD motif, responsible for viral RNA synthesis at its C-terminus. the remaining 100 aa at its N-terminus is still important for the normal function of the nsP4 in SINV [200] the nsP4 protein was found to interact with another Hsp90 protein, Hsp90. inhibition of Hsp90 resulted in a decrease in both viral RNA and protein levels. the mechanism behind this interaction remains to be discovered. the nsP2 triphosphatase is believed to be a strategy to confer protection against degradation by the host exonucleases. it has been suggested that the capping domain spans across at least the first 400 aa residues from the N terminus. however, it is important to note that the sequence (or structural) homology between SINV and CHIKV nsP1 is low. the nsP2 protein is one of the more well-studied and also the largest nsP. there are no reports of high resolution crystal structures of the entire nsP2. nsP2 is hypothesized to have three structural domains. the CHIKV nsP2 is only able to unwind double-stranded RNA that have a 5\u2032 overhang of at least 12 bp in and also only in the 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 directionality [160] the same active site used for the NTPase activity has also been found to perform RNA 5\u2032triphosphatase activities. CHIKV nsP2 can be detected in the nuclear region at 4 h post infection (h.p.i) before translocating to the cytoplasm at a later time point of 12 h.p.i. the nsP2 protein has also been found to be responsible for the suppression of host cellular translation processes without affecting viral protein translation. Rana and colleagues performed an extensive study on the host factors interacting with the nsP2 using a yeast two-hybird screen and ELISA. only heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP-K) and ubiquilin 4 (UBQLN4) were observed to play a significant role in CHIKV replication upon gene silencing [175]. nsP3 (530 amino acids, 60 kDa) protein possesses three domains, a highly conserved macro domain (160 aa), followed by a zinc2+ binding domain (165 aa) the macro domain is believed to function mainly as an ADP hydrolase that removes mono or poly ADP-ribose marks on proteins. the zinc binding domain of CHIKV nsp3 was inferred from the crystal structure of the SINV by Shin and colleagues. mutations in the zinc-binding region of SFV nsp3 resulted in defects in neurovirulence. the depletion of the G3BPs was found to be unfavorable for CHIKV replication. the proposed pro-viral activity of the G3BPs includes aiding the switch from the translation of non-structural proteins to viral RNA replication. in mosquito cells, the G3BP homolog, Rasputin (Rin), was found to exhibit similar phenomenon. the bulk of the nsP4 protein consists of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (500 aa), with the characteristic GDD motif responsible for viral RNA synthesis at its C-terminus. the remaining 100 aa at its N-terminus is still important for the normal function of the nsP4 in SINV [200] overexpression of CHIKV nsP4 suppressed phosphorylation of alpha subunit (eIF2), which in turn antagonizes the host unfolded protein response during infection. the mechanism behind this interaction remains unexplored. a number of host factors have been identified via different screening methods. the authors also reported four anti-viral factors (Rho family GTPase 3 (Rnd3), DEAD box helicase 56 (DDX56), polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1), and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2C (UbcH10)) which were down regulated during CHIKV infection. the exact mechanisms remain to be discovered. the synergistic effect resulted in a therapeutic antiviral effect in both in vivo and in vitro studies. however, the exact mechanism and role played by these host pathways in CHIKV replication warrants further work.
