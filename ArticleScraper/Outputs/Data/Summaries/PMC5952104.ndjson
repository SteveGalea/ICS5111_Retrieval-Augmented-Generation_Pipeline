{"summary": "ALI is caused by direct lung damage or indirect injury, including via bacterial infection of the blood. ALI may also be caused by collagen vascular diseases, drugs, ingestants, inhalants, shock, acute eosinophilic pneumonia, immunologically mediated pulmonary hemorrhage and vasculitis. gene expression data set GSE10474, generated by Howrylak et al (9) were retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus database (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) these data were obtained from whole blood of 34 patients, including 13 with ALI and sepsis (6 males and 7 females; mean age, 54.2 years) and 21 patients with sepsis alone. raw data with k-dimension subspace were mapped to n dimensions space (kn) using SIMCA version P10.0 (Umetrics; Satorius Stedim, Umea, Sweden) for DEGs. differential co-expression networks (CEN) are typically constructed based on co-expression between gene pairs. data were obtained from whole blood of 34 patients, including 13 with ALI and sepsis (6 males and 7 females; mean age, 54.2 years) and 21 patients with sepsis alone within 48 h of admission. all patients were recruited from the Medical Intensive Care Unit of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (Pittsburgh, PA, USA) between February 2005 and June 2007. Clue GO was used for GO term and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs. terms with P0.05 and a score of 0.4 were regarded as significantly enriched terms. co-expression networks are typically constructed based on co-expression between gene pairs. raw array data were preprocessed using the R Bioconductor package \u2018affy\u2019 (version 1.30.0; Affymetrix; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) as previously described (10) using three steps: Background-adjustment, quantile normalization and log2 transformation. multiple probe sets were mapped to a single transcript and the mean expression value of all probe sets was then calculated. modules obtained from gene differential co-expression analysis were assessed using GO biological process (BP) using the Biological Networks Gene Ontology tool (psb.ugent.be/cbd/papers/BiNGO/; version 2.3) (15). the differential co-expression network (DCEN) was constructed with the absolute value of correlation coefficient 0.9. BP terms, as well as the enriched genes in each term, are presented in Fig. 3. DEGs are involved in pathways associated with antigen processing and presentation, glycerophospholipid metabolism, transcriptional misregulation in cancer, thyroid hormone synthesis and pathways associated with diseases, such as asthma. the size of pathway nodes is associated with the significance of enrichment. larger nodes indicate smaller P-values. different colored nodes represent their different functional classes. Interactions between DEGs and different drugs are presented in Table I. these included interactions between HSP90B1 and adenosine-5\u2032-diphosphate and radicicol; HLA-DQB1 and amoxicillin, HLA-DQB1 and amoxicillin, HLA-DQB1 and insulin, porcine; HSPA5 and antihemophilic factor; and CD86 and abatacept as well as antithymocyte glob ine N/A DrugBank CD86 molecule Abatacept N/A TEND Abatacept Binder TTD Abatacept Antagonist DrugBank Antithymocyte globulin N/A DrugBank HSPA5 Heat shock 70 kDa protein 5 (glucose-regulated protein, 78 kDa). total 209 DEGs including 107 upregulated and 102 downregulated genes were screened. the size of BP nodes represents the significance of gene enrichment; bigger nodes indicate a smaller P-value. different colored nodes represent the different functional classes of genes. different colored nodes represent their different functional classes. the nodes with the corresponding color represent the names of the functional classes in each color class. Edges between pathway nodes and gene nodes represent the ownership of them. HLA-DQB1 and amoxicillin, HLA-DQB1 and insulin, porcine; HSPA5 and antihemophilic factor; and CD86 and abatacept as well as antithymocyte globulin. interactions mean that DEGs may target the corresponding drugs. total 209 DEGs including 107 upregulated and 102 downregulated genes were screened. the majority of circles are separate, which indicates that all DEGs were able to distinguish between samples from patients with ALI and sepsis. the size of BP nodes represents the significance of gene enrichment. larger nodes indicate a smaller P-value. Edges between BP nodes and gene nodes represent ownership. ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2D 4 (UBE2D4; putative; degree=529), (tubulin, complex associated protein 3, (TUBGCP3; degree=271) and centromere protein O (CENPO; degree=269) were the top three genes in the network. the red nodes represent upregulated genes; green nodes represent downregulated genes; the blue nodes represent normally expressed genes in samples taken from patients with ALI. Gene name Drug Interaction type Source HSP90B1 Heat shock protein 90 kDa (Grp94) member 1 Adenosine 5\u2032-diphosphate N/A DrugBank 2-(3-amino-2,5,6-trimethoxyphenyl)ether 5-chlor-2,4-dihydroxybenzoate N/A DrugBank 1-methocy-2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethane N/A DrugBank 2-chlorodide a total of 209 DEGs, including 107 upregulated and 102 downregulated genes, were screened. DEGs, including HSPA5, HSP90B1 and HLA-DRA, and GO terms, were identified. a DCEN containing UBE2D4 and TUBGCP3 was constructed. the protein encoded by UBE2D4 introduces covalent attachment of the E1 complex to other proteins and promotes polyubiquitination (28). the results of the current study indicated that protein misfolding and the unfolded protein response were enriched by DEGs, including HSPA5, HSP90B1 and HYOU1. previous study showed that ALI was associated with inflammation (36). antihemophilic factor was found to target HSPA5, whereas abatacept, which inhibits T lymphocyte activation (37), was found to target CD86. adenosine-5\u2032-diphosphate that acts on HSP90B1 acts on HSP90B1."}
