{"summary": "the exact role of B cells and Ab in MS remains controversial. but multiple B cell phenotypes are implicated in MS pathogenesis. the exact role of B cells and Ab in MS remains controversial. tertiary lymphoid organs or ectopic lymphoid follicles (ELF) are locally inducible within chronically inflamed sites. these structures contain the organizational, cellular, and molecular features found in SLO essential for propagating immune cell activation and antigen-driven selection. similar to SLO, ELF contain B cell-rich infiltrates. both infiltrating immune cells and CNS-resident cells produce B cell-related chemoattractants and trophic factors in the CNS. however, the relative contribution of ELF in fostering CNS compartmentalized B cell responses during acute models of MS remains controversial. in adoptive transfer EAE models, ELFs have been noted within the meninges and express some characteristic lymphoid factors including IL-17, LT, and chemokines involved in leukocyte hom chronic TMEV infection of the CNS in susceptible strains of mice produces a progressive clinical disease course exemplified by accrued disability. phenotype of accumulating B cells and role of ELF in supporting prolonged CNS compartmentalized inflammation and Ab production in TMEV-IDD has yet to be determined. mice were intracranially infected with 10 106 plaque forming units (PFU) of TMEV (BeAn strain) in 30 l final volume. all mice were housed under pathogen-free conditions at an accredited facility at Dartmouth College.

TMEV-IDD spinal cords showed no evidence of GL7 immunopositivity within immune cells containing IgG+ B cells. modest GL7 expression was observed on a small proportion of spinal cord-infiltrating B cells. GL7 expression analysis identified 10% or approximately 800 infiltrating B cells as expressing an \u201cactivated\u201d GL7int phenotype. in TMEV-IDD spinal cords, GL7int B cells were mostly IgD. otype GL7hi (red box) with the same gating applied to the smoothed dot plot of B cells isolated from the chronic TMEV-IDD spinal cord. histogram depicts CD80 expression among CLN CD19+ B cells (blue) at day 27 p.i. analysis of CD80 surface expression among CD45hi CD19+ B cells revealed expression on approximately 80% of infiltrating B cells. 80% of infiltrating B cells were an IgD phenotype, indicating CD80+ B cells include highly-activated, transitional, and/or Bmem phenotypes. gene expression analysis of these factors revealed constitutive expression of IL-21, IL-6, BAFF, and APRIL within spinal cords. sham-treated and TMEV-IDD mice showed modest upregulation of IL-21 (p = 0.06), with significant upregulation of APRIL (p = 0.01) and BA. mRNA levels in TMEV-IDD spinal cords were twice as high as shams. IL-21, APRIL, and BAFF mRNA levels in TMEV-IDD spinal cords were twice as high as shams. TMEV-IDD CSF samples compared to controls and overall low expression ranging from 10-30 pg/ml. further analysis of B cell trafficking and organizing chemokine protein levels revealed a modest increase in CXCL9 production in TMEV-IDD CSF (mean = 227 pg/ml) compared to sham. pg/mL and (B) CSF/serum ratios of B cell supporting cytokines in sham (n = 3\u20134) and chronic TMEV-infected mice (n = 11\u201312) at day 130 post-infection (p.i.) collected from three independent experiments. significant differences between sham and TMEV-infected mice are indicated (*P 0.05; **P 0.005) flow cytometry was used to examine infiltrating B cells in spinal cords. results revealed prominent CD45hi immune cell infiltration in TMEV-IDD spinal cords. sham-treated mice showed minimal presence of CD45hi-expressing cells. representative gating strategy for CD45hi CD19+ B cells (P2) and (D) scatter plots displaying CD19+ B cell percentages and numbers within CD45hi cells for individual TMEV-IDD mice with mean SEM for the group. gating strategy for B cell subpopulations was initially established in the CLN and then applied to spinal cord-infiltrating B cells. an unpaired Student's t-test determined the differentiation state of spinal-cord infiltrating B cells. we identified nave/early activated, activated, transitional or isotype-unswitched ASC/Bmem, isotype-switched ASC/Bmem, utilizing IgD and IgM surface expression. dotted line denotes cutoff for positive gating of MHCII+ cells. total percentage of MHCII+ (bottom) among CD45hi CD19+ CD138+ cells. B cells were comprised of an isotype-switched B cell phenotype. previous studies have documented elevated CSF Ab in TMEV-IDD. the findings led us to investigate if the presence of differentiated B cells associated with itAb production in the CSF. B cells were identified via B220, a surface marker present on immature and mature B cells but downregulated on terminally differentiated plasma cells. IgG was used to identify isotype-switched B cells, including IgG expressing ASC and Bmem. both B220+ and IgG+ B cells accumulated proximal to the central canal, within the ventral midline vasculature. ates Accumulate in the Absence of Ectopic Lymphoid Follicle Markers B220+ and IgG+ B cell accumulation within perivascular and meningeal regions led us to examine if these cellular aggregations displayed hallmark SLO-like ELF characteristics. spatial organization was examined by identifying the localization of T cells, key immune cells involved in initiating and organizing ELF formation. CD3 or B220 (green), IgG (red) and DAPI (blue) were co-stained to assess co-aggregation and organization of infiltrating immune cells. inset within IgG B220 costained representative shows B220+IgG+ double-positive B cell. ure, mature, and isotype-switched B cells in meningeal and perivascular spaces of TMEV-IDD spinal cords were apparent. to further evaluate whether immune cell aggregates expressed common features of SLO-like ELF, we utilized markers of proliferation and cell death. proliferation was assessed using Ki-67 and active caspase-3 was used as an indicator of apoptosis. flow cytometry showed minimal evidence for spinal cord-infiltrating B cells expressing a conventional GL7hi GC phenotype. modest GL7 expression was observed on a small proportion of spinal cord-infiltrating B cells. observed GL7int expression among a proportion of B cells within the spinal cord implied these B cells had acquired an activated phenotype.

IL-21, IL-6, BAFF, and APRIL are cytokines produced by astrocytes within the CNS during viral infection and autoimmunity (19, 75\u201377). sham-treated and TMEV-IDD mice showed modest upregulation of IL-21 (p = 0.06) transcript levels were comparable to sham-treated mice. overall, IL-21, APRIL, and BAFF mRNA levels in TMEV-IDD spinal cords were twice as high as shams. a modest increase in CXCL9 production in TMEV-IDD CSF (mean = 227 pg/ml) compared to sham (mean = 143 pg/ml), although results did not approach significance. CCL19 and CXCL13 both displayed significantly increased expression, with CCL19 reaching an average of 689 pg/ml in TMEV-IDD CSF. CSF levels are expressed as mean SEM for each group. CSF/serum ratios are expressed as dot plots showing individual values. significant differences between sham and TMEV-infected mice are indicated. elucidating B cell phenotypes and factors promoting persistent accumulation in the CNS compartment during chronic TMEV-IDD. previous studies have shown a prominent involvement of the B cells in the CNS compartment during TMEV-IDD. a high proportion of accumulating B cells expressed an isotype-switched, differentiated phenotype (70%), yet only 20% of total CD19+ were CD138+ ASC. other viral-induced encephalitic models have confirmed high percentages of CNS-infiltrating CD138+ MHCII phenotype B cells in the inflamed CNS (24). future studies validating the presence of Bmem during chronic TMEV-IDD are required to assess conventional surface molecules present on murine Bmem. m in chronic TMEV-IDD will be essential for our understanding of B cells in chronic demyelinating disease, including MS. meningeal inflammatory aggregates lacked several conventional features of SLO-like ELF necessary for driving local B cell differentiation into antigen-specific Bmem or ASC. spatial organization, heightened proliferation and cell death indicative of antigen-driven selection, FDC stromal networks, and detectable GL7 expression were all absent in chronic TMEV-IDD. the characteristics of the meningeal and perivascular clusters of inflammatory cells in TMEV-IDD may present insights into the controversial issues surrounding the existence and role of ELFs in MS. however, the presence of leukocyte aggregations does not confirm the meninges provide a niche for SLO-like ELF formation. the meninges are known to be a niche for harboring cells essential for promoting ongoing T cell activation. the abundance of T cells in meningeal and perivascular aggregates in the CNS during chronic TMEV-IDD resembles immune aggregates described in other viral infections of the CNS. GL7 and CD80 expression suggests most infiltrating B cells during chronic TMEV-IDD showed a contact-dependent CD4 T cell \u201chelped\u201d phenotype. further studies are needed to determine if T cell secreted factors are essential for sustaining persistent B cell accumulation and activation within the CNS compartment. the data show the ability for the CNS to foster isotype-switched B cell accumulation, ItAb synthesis, and production of B cell related chemokines and trophic factors. data Availability All raw data and protocols used to generate datasets for this study will be made available by the authors upon request."}
