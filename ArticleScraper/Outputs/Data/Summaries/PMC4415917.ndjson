{"summary": "eukaryotic proteasome is a 2MDa cylindrical shaped protease complex located in the cytoplasm and nucleus. it comprises a 20S proteolytic core and one or two 19S regulatory subunits. ubiquitin-tagged proteins are fed into the 20S core of the proteasome to be cleaved into smaller peptides. the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) has been described to play a role in non-degradative processes such as cell survival, cell survival, apoptosis, cell division, NF-B activation, DNA repair, transcriptional regulation, signal transduction, endocytosis and intracellular trafficking. many viruses have been implicated in utilizing or modulating the UPS to establish a productive infectious cycle [3,7\u201313]. quine encephalitis virus (VEEV) is a new world alphavirus belonging to the togaviridae family. VEEV is endemic to south America but has extended to the southern regions of the united states [16,18\u201320]. VEEV can easily be weaponized as exhibited in the past [21] and is therefore considered an important biodefense pathogen and select agent. capsid protein has unraveled as a multi-functional viral protein with cytoplasmic and nuclear distribution in infected cells. capsid protein has unraveled as a multi-functional viral protein with cytoplasmic and nuclear distribution in infected cells. virulent IAB Trinidad donkey strain (TrD) underwent an initial passage in chick embryos, then 78 passages in guinea pig heart cells to yield TC-78. one plaque was selected for further passage again in fetal guinea pig heart cells. the cells were seeded at 10,000 cells per well in a 96-well plate. they were infected for 1 hour to allow for viral adsorption at 37\u00b0C. the cells were infected for 1 hour to allow for viral adsorption. the cells were infected for 1 hour to allow for viral adsorption. cell viability was measured using a cell-titer-Glo luminescent cell viability kit. cells were seeded in 96-well white wall plates at 10,000 cells per well. the next day they were treated with varying concentrations of Bortezomib or MG132. cells were infected with TC-83 at an MOI of 5 and maintained at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2. at 2 or 6 hours post infection, cells were collected and lysed in a buffer containing Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), NaCl (120 mM), EDTA (5 mM), NP-40 (0.5%), NaF (50 mM), Na3VO4 (0.2 mM), DTT (1 mM) and one tablet anti-ubiquitin (linkage-specific K48) antibody (Abcam, ab140601) were incubated with respective secondary HRP-coupled antibody. membranes were visualized by chemiluminescence using superSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate Kit (ThermoScientific) and a BIO-RAD Molecular Imager ChemiDoc XRS system. the digested peptides were eluted using ZipTip purification (Millipore) the column was washed for 5 minutes at 200 nl/min with 0.1% formic acid. peptides were eluted using a 50-minute linear gradient from 0 to 40% acetonitrile and an additional step of 80% acetonitrile for 5 minutes. cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 minutes, washed, and placed in 70% ethanol overnight at 4\u00b0C. samples were then processed for RNA FISH using the Stellaris TC-83 viral RNA probes. cells were washed with a PBS solution containing DAPI. slides were incubated with primary antibody for 1 hour in the dark at room temperature. slides were then washed three times with PBS and incubated with DAPI. co-localization was confirmed with Z-stacks taken at 0.1m increments. q-RT-PCR assays were performed using bioRad iTaq universal Probes one-step 2x mix. the absolute quantification was calculated based on the threshold cycle (Ct) relative to the standard curve. supernatants from VEEV infected VERO cells were collected 48 hours post infection. RNA FISH experiment was performed as 2 independent experiments in duplicate. unless otherwise stated, graphs are the average of 2 independent experiments. all experimental results were expressed as the arithmetic mean. all select agents used are registered with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. human astrocytoma cells and African green monkey kidney epithelial cells (VERO cells) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin and 1% L-Glutamine at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2. the plates were rinsed with diH2O and the agarose plugs removed. visible plaques counted and viral titers determined as PFU/mL. cell viability was measured using a cell-Titer-Glo luminescent cell viability kit. ubiquitin plasmid with a HA tag (HA-Ub) was a kind gift from Dr. Benhur Lee. transfections were performed using Attractene Transfection Reagent (Qiagen, 301005). Western Blot Analysis Whole cell lysates were separated on a 4\u201320% Tris-Glycine Gel and transferred to a polyvinyl difluoride membrane using the iBlot gel transfer system (Invitrogen) primary antibodies to VEEV Capsid, Ubiquitin (Abcam, ab7780), and Anti-Ubiquitin (linkage-specific K48) antibody were used according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. beads were washed twice with TNE300 + 0.1% NP-40, followed by a single wash with TNE150 + 0.1% NP-40. LC-MS/MS analysis was carried out as previously described. samples were first lysed in 8M urea, after which they were reduced using DTT and acetylated using iodoacetamide. a probe set of 48 individual probes was generated and each probe was tagged with a Quasar 570 fluorophore. cells were seeded onto #1.0 coverslips in 24-well plates at a density of 54,000 cells per well. cells were pre-treated with 0.1M Bortezomib or DMSO for 2 hours. after 1 hour incubation, cells were replaced with the conditioned media. immunofluorescence U87MG cells were seeded at a density of 20,000 cells per well in an 8-well chambered slide. cells were either Bortezomib treated or DMSO treated, uninfected (Mock) or infected as described above. viral RNA was quantitated using q-RT-PCR with primers and probe for nucleotides 7931\u20138005 of VEEV TC-83. q-RT-PCR conditions were as follows: 1 cycle at 50\u00b0C for 30 minutes, 1 cycle at 95\u00b0C for 2 minutes and 40 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 15 seconds and 61\u00b0C for 1 minute.

Fig 1. Bortezomib inhibits TC-83 multiplication in U87MG cells. U87MG cells were seeded in a 96-well plate at a density of 10,000 cells per well. conditioned media were removed prior to infection with TC-83. the viral inoculum was removed and replaced with conditioned media. at 6, 12, 18 and 24 hours post infection supernatants were collected and analyzed by plaque assay. supernatants were collected 24 hours post infection and analyzed by plaque assay. a significant decrease in TC-83 multiplication was observed in Bortezomib treated cells at all time points investigated. at 24 hours post infection supernatants were collected and analyzed by plaque assay. we hypothesized that if the drug was provided post exposure, the longer the drug was available, the greater would be the extent of inhibition. if Bortezomib was removed, viral multiplication would resume. the peptide aldehyde MG132 inhibits the 20S proteasome activity by binding to the active sites of the beta subunits thus blocking proteolytic activity of the 26S proteasome [36]. MG132 reduced viral titers similar to the reduction observed with Bortezomib. supernatants were collected 24 hours post infection and analyzed by plaque assay. U87MG cells were seeded in a 96-well plate at a density of 10,000 cells per well. cells were treated with either DMSO or varying concentrations of MG132. supernatants were collected 24 hours post infection and analyzed by plaque assay for infectious viral particles (PFU/mL) the results suggest that Bortezomib is a broad spectrum inhibitor of virulent new world alphaviruses. the early stages of the infectious process in the cytoplasm of drug-treated cells were lysed at various time points post infection for analysis of intracellular viral RNA. we used RNA FISH with probes designed specifically to detect intracellular VEEV genomic copies in Bortezomib treated cells. VERO cells were fixed and processed for RNA FISH stained with VEEV vRNA specific FISH probes (red) we did not observe any co-localization of VEEV capsid with viral RNA in the TC-83 infected cells. however, the VEEV RNA FISH probes were specific to VEEV. cells were ed onto #1.0 coverslips in 24-well plates at a density of 54,000 cells per well. cells were pretreated with Bortezomib for 2 hours and then infected with TC-83. after 8 hours of infection, cells were fixed and processed for RNA FISH. the observed reduction was due to the inhibition of a viral protein(s) such as capsid that would normally be post translationally modified with ubiquitin. a total of 86 cells were counted of which 38 cells were infected. this translates to 61% of infected cells. panels E\u2013H serve as examples of infected cells in a given field of view. co-localization was confirmed by Z-stack analysis, quantified and tabulated below Fig 7B. cells were infected with TC-83 (MOI: 5) for 1 hour. at 6 hours post infection, cell lysates were collected and quantified. confocal microscopy with -K63 ubiquitin did not reveal a clearly discernable signal with the capsid protein. at 2, 5 and 6 hours post infection, cells were fixed and probed for K48 ubiquitin and capsid. co-localization was confirmed by Z-stack analysis, quantified and tabulated. cells were fixed and probed for capsid and K48 ubiquitin. at 2 hours post infection, cells were either infected or uninfected with TC-83. co-localization was confirmed by Z-stack analysis, quantified and tabulated. U87MG cells were seeded in an 8-well chambered slide at 20,000 cells per well. the cells were uninfected (Mock) or infected with TC-83 at an MOI of 10. images were taken using Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U. U87MG cells were treated with Bortezomib (0.1M) or DMSO for 2 hours. at 2 hours post infection cell lysates were collected, lysed and quantified. equal amounts of total protein were immunoprecipitated with capsid antibody and resolved by SDS-PAGE. cipitation with capsid antibody and an isotype IgG antibody as a control. the subsequent blot was probed for ubiquitin and capsid. the image is representative of duplicate immunoprecipitation runs. Fig 1A shows that in the presence of Bortezomib, TC-83 multiplication decreased in a dose-dependent fashion when compared to the DMSO control. at 1M Bortezomib a 4-log decrease was observed at 1M. a decrease in viral structural proteins was observed in the presence of Bortezomib. the observed decrease in capsid and glycoprotein expression was not affected by the increase in MOI. the graphs are representative of 2 independent experiments performed in triplicate. standard deviations were calculated from 2 independent experiments performed in triplicate. U87MG cells were infected with TC-83 at MOI: 0.1 (B), MOI: 1 (C) or MOI: 5 (D) for 1 hour. supernatants were collected 24 hours post infection and analyzed by plaque assay for infectious viral particles. at 0, 2, 3, 5, and 6 hours post infection the conditioned media were removed and replaced with culture media. as controls infected cells were treated with DMSO. at 24 hours post infection supernatants were collected and analyzed by plaque assay. MG132 inhibits the 20S proteasome activity by binding to the active sites of the beta subunits thus blocking proteolytic activity of the 26S proteasome [36]. MG132 was found not to be toxic to the cells at all concentrations tested. cells were seeded in a 96-well plate at a density of 10,000 cells per well. supernatants were collected 24 hours post infection and infectious viral titers (PFU/mL) were assessed by plaque assay. U87MG cells were pre-treated with DMSO or Bortezomib. they were then infected with VEEV TrD, EEEV strain GA97, or WEEV California 1930 strain for 1 hour. conditioned media were replaced and supernatants were collected 24 hours post infection. mib-treated cells revealed less infectious virus to be present in the supernatant of drug-treated cells. we quantified the amount of intracellular viral RNA during the early stages of the infectious process in the cytoplasm of drug-treated cells by q-RT-PCR using VEEV specific primers. VEEV RNA FISH probes were specific to VEEV and it did not interact with MP-12 RNA. the VEEV RNA FISH probes were specific to VEEV and it did not interact with MP-12 RNA. RT-PCR using VEEV specific primers is described in the methods section. the graphs represent an average of 2 independent experiments where each experiment was performed in triplicate. nuclei were detected using DAPI. images are shown as condensed Z-stacks. the images are representative of 2 independent experiments performed in duplicate. co-localization of capsid with ubiquitin was observed in 23 infected cells. this translates to 61% of infected cells displaying co-localization. panels E\u2013H (Fig 7B) serve as examples of infected cells in a given field of view. U87MG cells were seeded in an 8-well chambered slide at 20,000 cells per well. the cells were uninfected or infected with TC-83 at an MOI of 10. at 2 hours post transfection, cells were fixed and processed as described in the materials and methods section. confocal microscopy with -K63 ubiquitin did not reveal a clearly discernable signal with the capsid protein. confocal microscopy with -K63 ubiquitin did not reveal a clearly discernable signal with the capsid protein. we hypothesized that Bortezomib pre-treatment will decrease the available pool of free ubiquitin in the infectious process. confocal microscopy showed a decrease in K48 ubiquitination of capsid. cells were pre-treated with DMSO, Bortezomib or untreated. at 2 hours post infection, cells were fixed and probed for capsid and K48 ubiquitin. densitometric counts represented graphically illustrated a 31% decrease in K48 mono-ubiquitination and a 23% decrease in K48 poly-ubiquitination with Bortezomib treatment. at early time points of infection capsid was K48 ubiquitinated which was affected by Bortezomib treatment. images were taken using DAPI to observe the nuclei. images were taken using Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U with a 60X objective. six fractions were analyzed by plaque assay to determine the fraction with the purest viral suspension. Fraction 3 depicting the highest titer of sucrose purified virus was chosen for immunoprecipitation with capsid antibody and an isotype IgG antibody as a control. the subsequent blot was probed for ubiquitin and capsid and is shown in Fig 9B. a functional host proteasome system was used as a proteasomal inhibitor to demonstrate broad spectrum efficacy against the attenuated TC-83 strain and the virulent strains of VEEV, EEEV and WEEV at non-toxic concentrations. a functional UPS at early stages of the viral life cycle is necessary for efficient viral multiplication. Bortezomib inhibited mouse hepatitis coronavirus replication early in the infectious process. the inhibition was likely due to the inhibition of viral entry and/or viral RNA synthesis. ubiquitination of viral targets may also be dependent on tropism. VEEV capsid was K48 ubiquitinated early in infection. this may allow for release of the viral RNA for efficient RNA translation and replication. however, over time a modest decline in K48 ubiquitination of capsid was recorded. VEEV capsid is ubiquitinated and requires a proteasome system for degradation. further studies are needed to elucidate if other viral proteins require ubiquitination to ensure translation and synthesis of VEEV RNA."}
