{"summary": "the term 'translational recoding' describes the utilization of non-standard decoding during protein synthesis and encompasses such processes as ribosomal frameshifting, codon redefinition, translational bypassing and StopGo (1\u20137). the term 'translational recoding' describes the utilization of non-standard decoding during protein synthesis. recoding can also be used for the diversification of protein products encoded by a single gene. a presumed constant ratio of frameshifting in dnaX ensures a fixed stoichiometric balance between these two subunits. recoding also provides a mechanism for the translation of downstream ORFs on polycistronic RNAs. otide sequences may promote re-arrangements of tRNA molecules in mRNA inside the ribosome or affect recognition of tRNAs or release factors in the ribosomal A-site. many recoding signals act in the form of RNA secondary structures, such as simple stem-loops or more complex pseudoknots. some recoding events require the presence of additional machinery such as selenocysteine insertion. a similar situation occurs in bacterial insertion sequence (IS) elements. a certain group of IS elements utilize transcriptional slippage to produce ORFA\u2013ORFB fusions. many other IS elements utilize ribosomal frameshifting for the same purpose. the schema of the postgreSQL database is shown in Figure 1. The database stores information on individual genes that utilize recoding, the mechanisms and stimulatory signals involved, and references to the original literature sources that describe the recoding events. the database handles batch importation of properly designed RecodeML entries into the postgreSQL database. a short format that includes organism name, kingdom, genus, type of recoding event, status of the entry in the database and a link to the full database entry. the full description includes the following additional information: (i) the common name of the gene and the validation status of the recoding event. a large proportion of new data are still populated manually or semi-manually. the database will expand in accordance with the growth of available sequence information that will be scanned by one of the existing programs for recode annotation.
