{"summary": "type 1 VWD is the least serious subtype accounting for 70% of diagnosed cases. it is defined as a partial deficiency of functionally normal VWF. in most cases it shows dominant inheritance [1]. CLEC4M is a lectin receptor with a cytoplasmic domain, a transmembrane domain, a highly polymorphic neck region and a carbohydrate recognition domain. the neck region consists of a 23 amino acid long motif that is repeated from three to nine times in different variants of CLEC4M. variants in this gene contribute to the variation in the VWF level observed both in normal individuals [4] and in type 1 VWD patients. the study aimed to screen comprehensively for genetic variation in the CLEC4M gene in individuals from 106 unrelated type 1 VWD families by re-sequencing the gene region (excluding exon 4) and genotyping the polymorphic neck region (exon 4) of the gene. the overall goal of the study was to investigate whether genetic variants in CLEC4M are associated with type 1 VWD. 126 families mutation analysis identified 20 families with type 2 mutations. more than two-thirds of patients had a family history of bleeding, the remaining were individual patients with low VWF levels. PCR reactions contained 0.125 mM KAPA Taq DNA polymerase (KAPA Biosystems, Cape Town, South Africa), 1X KAPA Taq Extra Buffer, 1.75 mM. the PCR products were visualized using gel electrophoresis on 30 x 40 cm 3% agarose gels (Seakem LE, Lonza, Rockland, ME, USA) using separation for 2 h at 10 V/cm. the genotyping results were validated in several ways. 0.5X Big Dye sequencing ready reaction premix (Big Dye Terminator v 2.0, Applied Biosystems), 0.5X Big Dye Sequencing buffer and 3.2 pmol of the sequencing primer. sequence reactions were purified using Xterminator (Applied Biosystems) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. the type 1 study population was recruited at the Department for Coagulation Disorders, Malm\u00f6 University Hospital (Malm\u00f6, Sweden) the population represented the majority of all families diagnosed with type 1 VWD in Sweden during this time period. patients were characterized with respect to their VWF mutations in manderstedt et al. [18] of these 126 families mutation analysis identified 20 families with type 2 mutations. 106 families were analyzed in the present study. n (%) 75 (71%) VWF:Ag (IU/dL), median (IQR) 39 (30\u201345) aVWD1, the Swedish type 1 VWD population (n = 106); IQR, interquartile range Primer design The Ensembl Genome Browser (http://www.ensembl.org) contributed all DNA sequences that were used for primer design. the PCR products were visualized using gel electrophoresis on 30 x 40 cm 3% agarose gels (Seakem LE, Lonza, Rockland, ME, USA) using separation for 2 h at 10 V/cm. the genotyping results were validated in several ways: 1) The proper inheritance of alleles was confirmed by the analysis of three sets of trios (mother, father and child) genetic analysis Identified variants in the CLEC4M gene were compared to publicly available data in dbSNP and 1000Genomes databases. variants were obtained from the Integrated Variant Set, release April 2012, of the 1000Genomes Project. single nucleotide variants tested for association with disease status with a 2 test as implemented in PLINK [20] using the 106 type 1 VWD index cases and the C1 and C2 individuals as controls. the functional consequences of missense variants were evaluated using SIFT [22], PolyPhen-2 [23] and MutationTaster [24]. upstream T/C 0.350 nd 0.279 0.293 0.250 0.290 NEW 7827590.
