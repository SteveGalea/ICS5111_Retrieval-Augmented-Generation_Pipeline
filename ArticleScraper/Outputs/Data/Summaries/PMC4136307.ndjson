{"summary": "EBOV is a filamentous, nonsegmented, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus. it causes a severe hemorrhagic disease in humans and nonhuman primates. EBOV is considered a global health concern (2). genome-wide expression studies have provided useful information regarding the host response to EBOV infection. EBOV suppressed host antiviral responses including toll-like receptor (TLR)-, interferon (IFN) regulatory factor 3-, and protein kinase R (PKR)-mediated pathways in human hepatocytes. the aim of this study was to investigate the temporal host kinome response to EBOV infection in human hepatocytes. we used HUH7 liver cells as hepatocytes are targeted by EBOV during infection (20, 30) and HUH7 cells are permissive to EBOV infection (24). the in vitro results provide evidence of the power of this approach to rapidly identify therapeutic targets during EBOV infection. we propose a role for TGF-mediated signaling responses and epithelium-to-mesenchyme transition during EBOV infection that may have broader implications. HUH7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM) all cultures were maintained at 37\u00b0C in a humidified 5% (vol/vol) CO2 incubator. chemical inhibitors. SB431542 and LY294002 were purchased from SelleckChem. EBOV-infected and mock-infected cells were scraped and pelleted. cell pellets were prepared and incubated with human kinome arrays. a 70-l aliquot of the cleared supernatant was mixed with 10 l. Kinome arrays were incubated on a kinome array for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. arrays were washed once with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100. gamma irradiation to inactivate remaining virus (5 Mrad) the specific responses of each peptide were calculated by subtracting background intensity from foreground intensity. for each of the 297 peptides in a single treatment, the intensities induced by the treatments were subtracted from the intensities from the time-matched biological control. pathways are assigned a probability (P) value based on the number of genes present for a particular pathway, as well as the degree to which they are differentially expressed or modified relative to a control condition. proteins with known protein symbols and their corresponding phosphorylation values were uploaded and mapped to their corresponding protein objects in the IPA Knowledge Base. ines in the supernatants were analyzed using a millipore human 19-plex panel. supernatant samples were transferred to a 96-well plate and incubated with antibody-coated beads directed against different cytokines or chemokines. the beads were washed, incubated with anti-cytokine and anti-chemokine antibodies. h prior to removal from BSL4 conditions according to approved standard operating protocols and for an additional 24 h under BSL2 conditions with fresh 10% NBF. the effects of kinase inhibitors on HUH7 cell proliferation were evaluated using the WST-1 proliferation assay (Millipore) the RML is accredited by the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (PHS/OLAW Animal Welfare Assurance A4149-01) all procedures were carried out under ketamine anesthesia by trained personnel under supervision of veterinary staff. all efforts were made to ensure the welfare of the animals and to minimize their suffering. d secondary antibodies (Pierce) were visualized using a Syngene G:Box Chemi (Syngene) conditioned medium experiments. HUH7 cells were infected with EBOV-GFP or mock infected. cells were scraped into supernatant, and supernatants were clarified by centrifugation. vero E6 cells were infected with EBOV at a 1:1,000 dilution in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and monitored daily for cytopathic effect. supernatants were pooled and overlaid over 20% sucrose solution, and virus pellets were resuspended in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. SU1498 was purchased from EMD. all other inhibitors were purchased from Enzo Life Sciences. EBOV-infected and mock-infected HUH7 cells were scraped and pelleted. cell lysates were prepared and incubated with human kinome arrays. aliquot of the cleared supernatant was mixed with 10 l of activation mix. Array images were acquired using an Axon 4000B microarray scanner at 532 to 560 nm with a 580-nm filter to detect dye fluorescence. images were acquired using an Axon 4000B microarray scanner at 532 to 560 nm. eptide phosphorylations were subjected to paired t tests to compare their signal intensities. three tests were done for each peptide, as previously described. each treatment vector was considered a singleton at the initial stage of the clustering. rylation values were uploaded and mapped to their corresponding protein objects in the IPA Knowledge Base. proteins are represented as nodes, and the biological relationship between two nodes is represented as an edge (line) the intensity of the node color indicated the degree of up- or downregulation.

EBOV infection resulted in induction of fibronectin, matrix-metalloproteinase 9 and N-cadherin. EBOV infection resulted in upregulated phosphorylation of TAK1, SMAD3, ERK1/2, and p38. phosphorylation was downregulated in EBOV-infected cells compared to levels in mock-infected cells. cells were harvested 24 h postinfection and analyzed by Western blotting. values for fold change differences in expression are displayed as EBOV values relative to those of mock treatment following normalization based on -tubulin. infection of hepatocytes results in the modulation of specific cellular markers of epithelial cells. h p.i., TGF-1 secretion was significantly induced from EBOV-infected cells compared to mock-infected control cells. we observed a similar stimulatory effect on TGF-mediated signaling responses in hepatocytes after infection with either crude virus preparations or with purified virus. EBOV infection resulted in the upregulation of several TGF-regulated signaling pathways. phosphorylation of ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, SMAD3 and TAK1 was increased in EBOV-infected cells compared to levels under mock treatment conditions 24 h p.i., providing evidence for a role of these downstream signaling events in EBOV-induced TGF- signaling. regulatory roles for TGF- in VEGF secretion from epithelial cells, angiogenesis, and vascular permeability have been reported. so, the activation of TGF--mediated signaling during EBOV infection may contribute to viral pathogenesis through both local phenotypic effects on hepatocytes. the proposed model of EBOV-mediated TGF- activation and modulation of mesenchyme-like cell marker expression occurs over four stages. stage 1, Ebola virus infects epithelial cells; stage 2, dissociation of cell-to-cell contacts; stage 3, infected cells release various cytokines and chemokines that can have autocrine or paracrine effects. the inhibition of downstream PI3K/AKT and PKC signaling resulted in a greater reduction in EBOV lethality in vivo. this may reflect a protective effect from secreted VEGF from infected hepatocytes, as well as broader roles for the VEGF signaling pathway in EBOV infection. host responses of hepatocytes to EBOV infection have been modulated. kinomics has shown a role for the modulation of TGF--mediated signaling pathways in hepatocytes."}
