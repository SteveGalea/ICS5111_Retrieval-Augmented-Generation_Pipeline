{"summary": "fitness is a complex parameter often used by evolutionary biologists and ecologists. most studies only measure one or more fitness components as proxies to total fitness. fitness is just the relative ability of a viral strain to produce stable infectious progeny in a given host (cell type, organ, individual, or species) when resources have to be shared with a competitor. differences in viral fitness should also matter in genome-wide studies. it has been argued that an integrative systems biology approach would result in a better understanding of pathogenesis and in the identification of common targets for different viruses. the fitness of a given viral genotype depends on its own genetic background. differences in viral fitness reflect differences in the virus\u2013host interaction. viruses need to utilize all sort of cellular factors and resources, reprogram gene expression patterns into their own benefit. mutant genotypes differ from wild-type (WT) genotype in a rather limited number of nonsynonymous mutations (1 or 2). fitness values and severity of symptoms induced differ widely. mutant PC95 contains a point mutation in the replicase NIb protein (Revers and Garca 2015) occupies an intermediate position in the fitness scale (fig. 1B) eight-day postinoculation (dpi) symptomatic tissues were collected for all mutants except for the very low fitness mutant AS13. RNAs were extracted, normalized, and used to hybridize N. tabacum Gene Expression 4 44 K Microarrays (Agilent) TEV genotypes clustered (UPGMA) according to the similarity of the mean expression profiles of plants infected with each one of them. the heat-map represents the value of the Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient between pairs of mean profiles. arrow represents a putative trajectory of increasing viral fitness. the first cluster is constituted by the three viral genotypes with the higher fitness values, that is, WT, PC55, and PC48. plants infected with AS13 show the most dissimilar gene expression profile. low fitness AS13 is characterized by a positive third pc and a negative first pc while high fitness viruses are characterized by the opposite sign. over- or under-expressed genes are not progressively accumulated as long as viral fitness changes. these genes will be evaluated in the following sections. the number of down-expressed DEGs ranges between 531 (for AS13) and 2,809 (for CLA11), while in up-expressed DEGs the range is slightly narrower. the number of shared DEGs within each of these modules is > 75% of total. PC48, PC55, and PC95 alter the same genes, though in a different magnitude. the number of genes that are not in common with WT increases from CLA11 (502), CLA2 (969), and AS13 (2001) metabolic process (GO: 0008152) contains the largest number and photosynthesis (GO: 0015979) the smallest. regulation of response to biotic stimulus (GO: 0002831), defense response (GO: 006952), immune system process (GO: 0002376), protein modification process (GO: 0036211), hormone-mediated signaling (GO: 0009755), and cell death (GO: 008219) are all enriched in up-expressed DEGs. the second fitness plane corresponds to genotypes PC48 and PC55. the most remarkable difference between these two genotypes and the rest of genotypes is the significant enrichment in up-expressed DEGs related to signal transduction and regulation of gene expression. no significant enrichment in the hormone-mediated signaling module was found in plants infected with AS13 or for the other HC-Pro mutant genotypes CLA2 and CLA11. this observation motivated us to identify genes whose expression significantly correlates with viral fitness. however, it may provide a list of candidate genes to be considered as determinants of viral fitness. functional categories and molecular functions, if any, were enriched among these two subsets of DEGs. results are shown in figure 5B and functional annotations are all reported in the supplementary file S4, Supplementary Material online. positively correlated DEGs play a role in the transcriptional regulation of host defenses. negative correlation between expression and TEV fitness participate more in catalytic and transport activities than genes with positive correlation. this suggests a redirection of resources by host that is not independent of viral fitness. GASA1 encodes for a lipase/lipoxygenase that promotes abiotic stress tolerance. the negatively correlated DEGs selected for validation are the adenosine kinase 2 gene (ADK2; rS = 0.857), the AGAMOUS-like 20 gene (AGL20; rS = 0.786), the factor of DNA methylation 1 gene, and the granule-bound starch synthase 1 GBSS1 is involved in glucan biosynthesis and responsible of amylase synthesis that is essential for plant growth and other developmental processes. RT-qPCR-based relative expression data were calculated using the CT method normalized by each one of the two reference genes. the right panel shows the relationship between normalized (z-score) expression levels measured by transcriptomics with microarrays and RT-qPCR (y-axis) the solid line represents the null hypothesis of equal expression values. the closer the slopes of both lines, the more similarity between microarray and RT-qPCR expression data. the observed correlations between gene expression and viral fitness are consistent for both experimental methods used to evaluate levels of gene expression. we further delineated a picture of virus\u2013plant interactions reflected in precise alterations of transcriptomic profiles and regulatory networks. from the plant perspective, activation of basal defenses, immunity, hormone-regulated pathways, and RNA-silencing will result in an immediate benefit to control virus replication and spread. kinases 2 and 7, brassinosteroid BAK1 BRI1-associated receptor kinase, ethylene response factors, and members of abscisic acid perception pathway. genes involved in methylation-mediated stress responses, such as ADK2, FDM1 or the methionine adenosyltransferase MAT3 reduce their expression as virus replication is more efficient, thus resulting in less methylation. genes involved in actin cytoskeleton organization such as ADF4 and PFN3 are negatively correlated with TEV fitness. the expression of genes involved in actin cytoskeleton organization such as ADF4 and PFN3 is negatively correlated with TEV fitness. ubiquitin-protein ligase 1, UPL1; ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 2, UBC2; ubiquitin E2 variant 1B, MMZ2; ubiquitin E2 variant 1B, MMZ2; ubiquitin E2 variant 1B, MMZ2; ubiquitin E2 variant 1B, MMZ2; ubiquitin E2 variant 1B, MMZ2; EIN3-binding F box eIF4E, known to be exploited by TEV for its own translation, is unperturbed. eIF3A and eIF4G expression is positively correlated with TEV fitness. this picture of virus\u2013plant interaction may be biased by the limited number of viral genotypes analyzed in this work. RNA silencing and methylation are functions involved in defense against pathogens that are quantitatively regulated. complexity at molecular level is astonishing both in terms of possible elements (genes, functional RNAs, proteins, and metabolites) and of interactions among them. symptoms are generally uncoupled from magnitude of the perturbation at the molecular level in the host (with respect to a healthy state) we studied the use of viral fitness as an indicator of the molecular changes occurring in the host upon infection. the progress of a viral infection depends on the fitness of the virus mutant swarm. fitness differences among genotypes are due to several causes. fitness is a good indicator of how a given mutant reprograms gene expression patterns, to its own benefit or as a consequence of cellular defenses. evolution experiments simulating the spillover of TEV from its natural host into a novel, poorly susceptible one, Arabidopsis thaliana, have shown that adaptation of TEV to the novel host was associated with a profound change in the way the ancestral and evolved viruses interacted with the plant\u2019s transcriptome. the more virulent strain mainly altered stress responses and transport functions compared with the mild one. both transcriptomes differed in many aspects, including repression of photosynthesis-related genes, genes involved in the RNA silencing pathway, the jasmonic acid signaling pathway, and auxin signaling transduction. the fitness of each mutant genotype was estimated as the ratio of Malthusian growth rates of the mutant and the WT. significant differences existed among the fitness values of the seven selected viral genotypes. a Bonferroni post hoc test classifies the seven genotypes into five groups. point mutation in the replicase NIb protein occupies an intermediate position in the fitness scale. arrows point to symptoms induced by each one of the seven genotypes. no correlation exists between virus fitness and symptoms. eight-day postinoculation symptomatic tissues were collected for all mutants except for the very low fitness mutant AS13. total RNAs were extracted, normalized, and used to hybridize N. tabacum Gene Expression 4 44 K Microarrays (Agilent) the heat-map represents the value of the Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient between pairs of mean profiles. the three first PCs explain up to 93% of the total observed variance. the arrow represents a putative trajectory of increasing viral fitness. the first cluster is constituted by the three viral genotypes with the higher fitness values. plants infected with AS13 show the most dissimilar gene expression profile. the heat-map is shown with viral genotypes ordered according to the UPGMA clustering. low fitness AS13 is characterized by a positive third pc and a negative first pc while high fitness viruses are characterized by the opposite sign. over- or under-expressed genes are not progressively accumulated as long as viral fitness changes. the number of down-expressed DEGs ranges between 531 (for AS13) and 2,809 (for CLA11), while in up-expressed DEGs the range is slightly narrower. the number of shared DEGs within each of these modules is > 75% of total. the number of shared DEGs between modules drops 60%. PC48, PC55, and PC95 alter the same genes, though in a different magnitude. the number of genes that are not in common with WT increases from CLA11 (502), CLA2 (969), and AS13 (2001). of particular interest is the similarity between PC95, a mutant of the replicase NIb gene, and CLA11, a mutant of the VSR HC-Pro gene. metabolic process (GO: 0008152) contains the largest number and photosynthesis (GO: 0015979) the smallest. regulation of response to biotic stimulus (GO: 0002831), defense response (GO: 006952), immune system process (GO: 0002376), protein modification process (GO: 00036211), hormone-mediated signaling (GO: 0009755), and cell death (GO: 008219) are all enriched in up-expressed DEGs. the second fitness plane corresponds to genotypes PC48 and PC55, both of mild effect and carrying mutation in the CI gene. the most remarkable difference between these two genotypes and the rest of genotypes is the significant enrichment in up-expressed DEGs. signaling module was found in plants infected with AS13, or for other HC-Pro mutant genotypes CLA2 and CLA11. correlation between gene expression and viral fitness varies with the fitness of the virus being inoculated. a total of 326 DEGs show a significant positive correlation while 154 show a significant negative one. functional categories and molecular functions, if any, were enriched among these two subsets of DEGs. results are shown in figure 5B and functional annotations are all reported in the supplementary file S4, Supplementary Material online. negative correlation between expression and TEV fitness suggests a redirection of resources by the host that is not independent of viral fitness. four positively correlated and five negatively correlated DEGs that cover the entire range of observed significant significant correlation coefficients. they represent different biological functions and are expressed at different developmental stages and under different environmental situations. GASA1 encodes for a lipase/lipoxygenase that promotes abiotic stress tolerance. the negative correlated DEGs selected for validation are the adenosine kinase 2 gene (ADK2; rS = 0.857), the AGAMOUS-like 20 gene (AGL20; rS = 0.786), the factor of DNA methylation 1 gene, and the granule-bound starch synthase 1 GBSS1 is involved in glucan biosynthesis and responsible of amylase synthesis that is essential for plant growth and other developmental processes. RT-qPCR-based relative expression data were calculated using the CT method normalized by each one of the two reference genes and then averaged. the right panel shows the relationship between the normalized (z-score) expression levels measured by transcriptomics with microarrays and by RT-qPCR (y-axis) the solid line represents the null hypothesis of equal expression values. the closer the slopes of both lines, the more similarity between microarray and RT-qPCR expression data. gene expression and viral fitness consistent for both experimental methods. plant\u2013virus interactions result from confrontation of two players with opposed strategies and interests. activation of basal defenses, immunity, hormone-regulated pathways, and RNA-silencing will result in an immediate benefit to control virus replication and spread. genes involved in methylation-mediated stress responses, such as ADK2, FDM1 or the methionine adenosyltransferase MAT3 reduce their expression as virus replication is more efficient. in this way, the overexpression of genes that modulate histone acetylation or chromatin organization, such as the histone acetyltransferase HAC1 and the chromatin remodeling factor R17 (CHR17) would regulate differentiation, metabolism whose repression correlates with viral fitness, such as GBSS1, photosystem components, or assembly factors (e.g., LHCB1.3 and HCF136), Rubisco subunits and ATPases, catalases, transketolases, nucleotide and phosphate transporters, synthases involved in flavonoid, isoprenoid, ascorbate, or tryptophan biosynthesis, and GAPDH. reprogramm ubiquitin-protein ligase 1, UPL1; ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 2, UBC2; ubiquitin E2 variant 1B, MMZ2; ubiquitin E2 variant 1B, MMZ2; ubiquitin E2 variant 1B, MMZ2; ubiquitin E2 variant 1B, MMZ2; ubiquitin E2 variant 1B, MMZ2; EIN3-binding F box eIF4E, known to be exploited by TEV for its own translation, is unperturbed. eIF3A and eIF4G expression is positively correlated with TEV fitness. this picture of virus\u2013plant interaction may be biased by the limited number of viral genotypes analyzed in this work. RNA silencing and methylation are functions involved in defense against pathogens that are quantitatively regulated. complexity at the molecular level (i.e., the lowest level of biological organization) is astonishing both in terms of possible elements (genes, functional RNAs, proteins, and metabolites) and of interactions among them. we studied the use of viral fitness as an indicator of the molecular changes occurring in the host upon infection. the progress of a viral infection depends on the fitness of the virus mutant swarm. mutated viral components may interact in nonoptimal ways with the complex network of genetic and biochemical interactions of the cell as a whole. evolution experiments simulating the spillover of TEV from its natural host into a novel, poorly susceptible one, Arabidopsis thaliana. adaptation of TEV to the novel host was associated with a profound change in the way the ancestral and evolved viruses interacted with the plant\u2019s transcriptome. genes involved in the response to biotic stresses, including signal transduction and innate immunity pathways, were significantly underexpressed in plants infected with the evolved virus. a virulent strain of turnip mosaic potyvirus also showed profound differences in genes and functional categories altered. the more virulent strain mainly altered stress responses and transport functions compared with the mild one. both transcriptomes differed in many aspects, including repression of photosynthesis-related genes, genes involved in the RNA silencing pathway and the jasmonic acid signaling pathway. pMTEV-derived plasmids contain a unique BglII restriction site. each plasmid was transcribed with mMESSAGE mMACHINE SP6 kit (Ambion) each transcript was confirmed by sequencing of a ca. 800-bp fragment. the 5\u2032-capped RNA transcripts were mixed with a 1:10 volume of inoculation buffer (0.5 M K2HPO4, 100 mg/ml Carborundum) batches of 8-week-old N. tabacum plants were inoculated with 5 g of RNA of each viral genotype by abrasion of the third true leaf. plants were maintained in a greenhouse chamber at 25\u00b0C under a 16-h natural sunlight. the concentration of total plant RNA extract was adjusted to 50 ng/l. each RNA sample was resequenced again at this stage to ensure the constancy of the genotypes. fitness evaluations Total RNA was extracted and virus accumulation quantified by RT-qPCR as described earlier and detailed previously.
