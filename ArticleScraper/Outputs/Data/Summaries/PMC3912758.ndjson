{"summary": "etiology is \u2018the cause or causes of a disease or abnormal condition\u2019. etiology is \u2018the cause or causes of a disease or abnormal condition\u2019. by characterizing bacteria as the etiological agents of periodontal diseases, we are stating that they cause these diseases. man (266) expanded this model to acknowledge the contributions of genetic and acquired risk factors. the concept of multiple causes is clearly not unique to periodontal diseases. but it is also clear that by itself it is not a sufficient cause. vitis classical study performed by L\u00f6e et al. (213) was cited as an example of \u2018lowlevel\u2019 evidence that infection leads to destructive periodontal disease. it was argued that the study was flawed because it had a small sample size of 12 subjects, used an acute model to make inferences on a chronic disease and the findings were extrapolated to periodontitis that, according to the author, was \u2018a huge leap\u2019. 'experimental gingivitis' has become a standard model for examining the effects of different antiplaque agents and in the study of risk factors for the development of gingivitis. the criticism that the model has an acute onset quite distinct from the chronic nature of gingivitis is valid. human studies have documented the resolution and prevention of recurrence of naturally occurring gingivitis following mechanical plaque removal. the original experimental gingivitis studies have been presented in the periodontal literature as evidence of a causeandeffect relationship between dental plaque and gingivitis. this finding suggested a less robust association between dental plaque accumulation and attachment loss compared with the association between dental plaque accumulation and gingivitis. this finding suggested a less robust association between plaque accumulation and attachment loss compared with the association between dental plaque accumulation and gingivitis. a recent longitudinal study followed a cohort of 223 Norwegian subjects over 26 years. the study population initially comprised 1,037 children. oral examinations were repeated at ages 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 18, 21, 26 and 35 years. periodontal diseases are infections caused by bacteria. these agents, in contrast to other classes of antibiotics, have no known antiinflammatory effects. a study by socransky & Haffajee in 1994. patients were examined every 2 months for 12 months to detect periodontal disease progression by changes in clinical attachment level. the antibiotic regimen (amoxicillin 500 mg and metronidazole 250 mg, three times daily for 7 days) was administered at baseline, and at 4 and 8 months. antibiotics group had statistically significantly better clinical outcomes at all 2month intervals. cases of localized aggressive periodontitis, where clinically distinct periodontal diseases were associated with different subgingival microbiotas. the accepted dogma became that specific microorganisms were associated with different periodontal diseases. the idea of specificity in the etiology of periodontal diseases launched an extremely prolific era of research in periodontal microbiology. ycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis and Tannerella forsythia as periodontal pathogens. these efforts are still ongoing and will probably require a few decades of intensive research before we have identified all periodontal pathogens. if we are to fully examine the pathogenic potential of yetuncultured species, methods to grow them in the laboratory will have to be in place. the search for periodontal pathogens has engrossed periodontal research workers for close to 100 years. they described the search as another example of cycles of lessons learned and unlearned in the field of periodontal microbiology. they detailed a series of difficulties encountered by microbiologists in the study of periodontal pathogens. cytophaga gingivalis, Treponema denticola, Treponema socranskii, Eubacterium nodatum and Campylobacter rectus (126, 141, 222, 271, 273, 308, 382, 383, 405) other species have been reported to be associated with periodontal diseases. a criterion of temporality can be used in support of an etiological role for A. actinomycetemcomitans in cases of localized aggressive periodontitis. however, it can be argued that increased levels and proportions of certain species in diseased sites occur as a consequence of the environmental changes resulting from the disease process. the microbial composition of the subgingival microbiota is examined to determine species potentially involved in disease progression. the concept of temporality is further complicated by the concept of \u2018induction period\u2019, defined as the time from causal action to disease initiation (297). the terms \u2018initiator\u2019 and \u2018promoter\u2019 have been used in carcinogenesis to describe component causes of cancer that act early or late in the causal mechanism. in the context of periodontitis, bacteria could be described as the initiator and the inflammatory response as the promoter. the final mechanisms that result in bone resorption might be defined as promoters. studies have tried to establish temporality in an effort to implicate specific bacterial species in the etiology of periodontal diseases. however, it can be argued that the detection of increased levels of putative periodontal pathogens after tissue destruction has occurred is not evidence against its pathogenic role. study subjects are monitored clinically every 2 months, bacterial samples are collected at baseline and when disease progression is diagnosed. a limitation of early studies was the low throughput of existing microbiological techniques. these studies have helped implicate several subgingival species in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases. in our current model of periodontal disease pathogenesis, it is well accepted that immune pathology is a major mechanism of tissue destruction. the terms \u2018initiator\u2019 and \u2018promoter\u2019 have been used in carcinogenesis to describe component causes of cancer that act early or late in the causal mechanism. periodontal diseases are viral\u2013bacterial infections In the 1990s a potential role of viruses in the etiology of periodontal diseases was proposed. the hypothesis was based primarily on association studies that showed an increase in the load of Epstein\u2013Barr virus type 1. coinfection with murine cytomegalovirus and P. gingivalis resulted in a significantly higher rate of mortality compared with mice monoinfected with either pathogen alone. recent studies have suggested that this coinfection could also enhance the pathogenicity of the virus. human cytomegalovirus IL10 can suppress the transcription of tumor necrosis factoralpha and interleukin1 (250). viruses may induce the release of catabolic inflammatory mediators or other immunopathological mechanisms, causing indirect damage to periodontal tissues. the elevated frequency of detection of herpesviruses in periodontitis lesions has been reported by studies examining samples from different geographic locations. sites with active periodontitis also carry significantly higher numbers of lymphocytes with latent viruses than do stable sites (409) sunde et al. (350) reported on the treatment of a subject with refractory periodontitis using the antiviral drug valacyclovirHCl, 500 mg twice daily for 10 days. the therapy resulted in the suppression of Epstein\u2013Barr virus for up to 1 year. the levels of the chronic periodontitis/human T lymphotropic virus1 and control groups were similar in samples from the chronic periodontitis/human T lymphotropic virus1 and chronic periodontitis groups. the authors concluded that human T lymphotropic virus1 might alter the local cytokine milieu, resulting in an increased immunoinflammatory response to a similar bacterial challenge. if viruses are involved in the pathogenesis of periodontal infections, it is anticipated that viral replication would occur before periods of disease activity or progression. if viruses are involved in the pathogenesis of periodontal infections, it is expected that viral replication would occur before periods of disease activity or progression. more than 65% of all bacterial infections in humans are associated with biofilms. it is estimated that 0.1% of the total microbial biomass lives in the planktonic mode of growth (37) biofilms are characterized by heterogeneous microenvironments within their structure, determined by the gradients of nutrients, oxygen and metabolic waste. the dental field was decades ahead of the medical field in recognizing chronic biofilm infections. detailed descriptions of the structural features of supragingival and subgingival dental plaque have already been in place since the late 1960s and 1970s. invivo biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa do not form highly structured mushrooms. the biofilm mode of growth implies that bacteria live and behave as integrated communities, rather than independent entities. this notion also calls into question the role of certain species in pathogenesis of chronic biofilm infections. preliminary data comparing transcriptomic profile from healthyassociated biofilms with that of diseaseassociated biofilms indicate putative periodontal pathogens seem to be more \u2018active\u2019 in diseased than healthyassociated microbial communities. the concept of a community as pathogen does not discard the possibility that certain components of that community have a more relevant role in the disease process. biofilms are not more resistant to antibiotics, but more tolerant to them. the protection granted by the biofilm mode of growth to the subgingival microbiota does not render them immune to the effects of systemic antibiotics. a subset of persistent cells within the biofilm community is the main mechanism that guarantees their survival after exposure to antibiotics. persisters can be readily killed by antiseptics, but their use in most infections is precluded by the systemic effects of these compounds. a simple strategy could be devised where the regimen of systemic antibiotics would be followed by the local application of antiseptics to the base of the residual pockets. environmental conditions such as temperature, osmotic pressure, concentration of iron, magnesium or calcium, redox potential, pH and availability of nutrients can alter patterns of gene expression and possibly pathogenic potential of certain bacterial strains. the notion that properties of microhabitats impact biofilm development has permeated the literature on periodontal microbiology. a series of papers from our department and collaborators have examined the changes in the microbiota from different oral habitats over time. these papers also examined the impact of environmental forces on microbial succession and greatly expanded our understanding of the interplay between the oral microbiota and the local environment. supragingival samples were taken from 38 periodontally healthy subjects. subjects refrained from oralhygiene procedures for the 7day test period. samples were removed, precleaning and immediately postcleaning from the mesiobuccal aspect of each tooth. complexes of mainly Streptococcus (yellow complex) and Actinomyces species, similar to those described for subgingival biofilms (337), could be identified. the other complexes (i.e. green, purple, orange and red) were similar to those described for subgingival biofilms. a loose association of redcomplex species with A. actinomycetemcomitans, Eubacterium saburreum, P. micra and P. melaninogenica in the longterm redevelopment biofilms. diagram was based on the results of nine cluster and two community ordination analyses using the baseline data from 187 subjects. the presence of gingival recessions also seemed to enhance the accumulation of supragingival biofilm. this was possibly because of an increased surface area for plaque retention or differential adherence of specific species to cementum and/or dentin. the samples were divided into 10 groups using the 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 60, 70, 80 and 90th percentiles of the total counts as cutoff points. xaxis values represent the mean values for totalDNA probe counts of each group and the yaxis represents the sum of the proportions comprised by the species in each microbial complex. the composition of supragingival biofilms and their rate of redevelopment are also influenced by the nature of the surface being colonized and the access to gingival crevicular fluid as source of nutrients. this was demonstrated in recent publications that have examined the composition and development patterns of supragingival biofilms. the rate of biofilm redevelopment on natural teeth was far more rapid than on denture teeth. however, previous invivo studies have shown that protein adsorption to surfaces and bacterial adherence are mostly determined by surface roughness rather than by other physicochemical properties of those surfaces. samples were obtained from up to seven teeth in randomly selected quadrants at 1, 2, 4 and 7 days after tooth cleaning. species counts in the samples were averaged within each subject at each time point and were then averaged across subjects in the two clinical groups. species were ordered and colorcoded according to previously described microbial complexes. fusobacteria might have favored the growth of certain facultative/anaerobic nonsaccharolytic species, including members of the orange and red complexes (70, 305, 362) colonization of the supragingival environment is initiated by members of the yellow complex, such as S. mitis and S. oralis. the first wave of growth, from 0 to 2 days, was associated with a sharp increase in levels of members of the Actinomyces, purple and green complexes. the second wave of growth, from 4 to 7 days, was characterized by a sharp increase in the levels of orangecomplex species. changes in the levels of oxygen, nutrient availability or pH might no longer be conducive to the early colonizers but may facilitate the growth of other species. the faster redevelopment of subgingival biofilms in periodontitis subjects than in periodontally healthy subjects. a greater number of residual cells left within periodontal pockets after mechanical debridement could contribute to the repopulation of that environment. baseline visit occurred 21 days after a preparation phase to achieve gingival health and minimal plaque accumulation (Day 0) days 3, 7, 10, 14 and 21 correspond to different time points after interruption of oralhygiene practices (experimental gingivitis phase), and Day 35 corresponds to the resolution of the experimental gingivitis. all subjects were enrolled in a 3year preventive program. levels of redcomplex species were also increased in sites constantly exposed to inflammation compared with 'gingivitis free' sites. the species were ordered and grouped according to the complexes described by Socransky et al. ( 38 ). the figure was generated from data from Bogren et al. ( 38 ). microbial analysis of 13,261 plaque samples posited colonization of the subgingival environment was required for the establishment of the socalled redcomplex species. authors suggested that this knowledge could be used in prevention strategies where orangecomplex species would be targeted, resulting in the inhibition of the more pathogenic species. alteration of the local environment leads to an altered ecosystem and additional changes in the composition of the subgingival microbiota. therapy is to \u2018set the clock back\u2019 for the development of the mature biofilm, requiring the subgingival microbiota to go through timeconsuming changes necessary to trigger disease recurrence. recolonization of the supragingival environment occurs fast, with counts reaching precleaning levels within 2 days (373). despite a significantly higher baseline mean bacterial count of supragingival bacteria in subjects with periodontitis compared with periodontally healthy subjects, the 7day recolonization on the supragingival habitat presented similar patterns. the subjects refrained from oralhygiene procedures for the 7day test period. samples were removed, precleaning and immediately postcleaning from the mesiobuccal aspect of each tooth. species counts in the samples were averaged within each subject at each time point. the species were ordered and colorcoded according to previously described microbial complexes. capnocytophaga ochracea appeared to be associated more with members of the orange complex than with members of the green complex. N. mucosa and N. mucosa appeared to comprise a new \u2018purple\u2019 complex in which N. mucosa replaced Actinomyces odontolyticus. diagram was based on the results of nine cluster and two community ordination analyses using the baseline data from 187 subjects. modified with permission from Haffajee et al. ( 136 ). ochracea and C. gingivalis examined the impact of plaque mass and tooth position on the composition of supragingival biofilms. the proportions of species of green and orange complexes increased markedly in samples with a high plaque mass. the proportions of members of Actinomyces and purple complexes decreased. the xaxis values represent the mean values for totalDNA probe counts of each group. the yaxis represents the sum of the proportions comprised by the species in each microbial complex. the composition of supragingival biofilms and their rate of redevelopment are also influenced by the nature of the surface being colonized. this was demonstrated in recent publications that have examined the composition and development patterns of biofilms that formed on denture teeth compared with natural teeth (299, 360). vivo studies have shown that protein adsorption to surfaces and bacterial adherence are mostly determined by surface roughness. with increased roughness more plaque was accumulated and the complexity of the composition of these biofilms also seemed to increase. the rate of biofilm regrowth would be faster on denture teeth than on natural teeth. the plots present the cumulative mean values at each time point in each clinical group. the species were ordered and colorcoded according to previously described microbial complexes. colonization of supragingival environment is initiated by members of the yellow complex, such as S. mitis and S. oralis, while accumulation of Actinomyces species is somewhat slower. development and composition of supragingival microbiota is influenced by the presence of inflammation and deep pockets in adjacent tissues. changes in levels of oxygen, nutrient availability or pH may no longer be conducive to the early colonizers but may facilitate the growth of other species, suggesting a pattern of autogenic microbial species succession (336). microbial species were ordered and colorcoded according to previously described microbial complexes. plaque accumulation was examined for 21 days using checkerboard DNA\u2013DNA hybridization (412) the data for day 0 showed low mean counts for the 40 species tested. levels of members of Actinomyces, greencomplex and orangecomplex species increased. Counts of 40 subgingival species were measured for each sample using checkerboard DNA\u2013DNA hybridization. data were averaged within a subject and then averaged across subjects at each time point separately. the species were ordered and grouped according to the complexes described by Lee et al. chia buccalis, Propionibacterium acnes and S. noxia were associated with the presence of longstanding gingivitis. levels of redcomplex species were also increased in sites constantly exposed to inflammation compared with \u2018gingivitis free\u2019 sites. the ecological plaque hypothesis provides an excellent framework to explain the effects of periodontal antiinfective therapies. a longheld misconception in the field of periodontal microbiology is that recolonization occurs fast (within weeks), resulting in the need for continuous reinstrumentation to maintain the results obtained with therapy. treatment of periodontal diseases does not involve the reduction of a single bacterial species, but rather the alteration of an ecosystem to one in which pathogenic species remain below the threshold required for disease initiation or progression. therapy results in a reduction of the deep periodontal pockets that foster colonization of redcomplex and orangecomplex species. the subgingival microbiota seems to require a longer period of time to recompose itself. it is also conceivable that a stronger antimicrobial effect might allow for a better and faster healing of the periodontal tissues. the subgingival microbiota seems to require a longer period of time to recompose itself. the specific plaque hypothesis seems to have reached a certain level of consensus in the scientific community since the 1970s. however, the use of molecular techniques to examine the microbiota of different body sites has raised awareness of the high degree of intraspecies genetic diversity. some microbiologists question the existence of bacterial species (101) ribosomal RNA sequences have been favored for determining the closest relatives of an isolate. this is particularly relevant in the context of biofilm infections, where high cell density and close contact might enhance horizontal gene transfer. horizontal gene transfer has been proposed as a mechanism that allows strains to obtain rapid access to genetic material carrying virulence factors and antibiotic resistance, impacting on the pathogenic potential of the recipient cells. a beneficial mutation would allow selection of the strains that acquired this trait, eliminating genetic variability from the population. a beneficial mutation would allow selection of the strains that acquired this trait, eliminating genetic variability from the population. natural selection would help to control the accumulation of neutral diversity that does not confer any additional benefit to the bacterial strains. despite these mechanisms, horizontal gene transfer occurs between bacterial species. but lateral gene transfers involving phylogenetically distant bacteria are infrequent. a recent study showed that natural competence mechanisms are present in multiple strains of P. gingivalis (370) phenotypes argue that bacterial species can be rationally identified and named, despite their genetic variability. the core genome hypothesis reconciles the existence of dynamic genomes conferred by horizontal gene transfer with the existence of clusters of isolates that exhibit similar phenotypic traits. the infectious nature of the disease led to an interest in determining the epidemiology of periodontal pathogens. a number of studies used restriction endonuclease analysis (113, 218), restriction fragment length polymorphism (216), multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (217) and arbitrarily primed PCR (239) to measure the relatedness of bacterial strains isolated from different individuals. the same clonal types were often found in closely related individuals. it was shown that typically only one or two clones would colonize any given individual (11, 20, 219) some authors suggest that P. gingivalis is a commensal organism that can become an opportunistic pathogen. but the lack of distinct pathogenic clones within bacterial species does not define commensalism (20) different researchers have also sought genotypic and phenotypic traits that could be involved in pathogenesis of periodontal diseases. multilocus sequence typing is a nucleotide sequencebased approach for genetic characterization of bacterial isolates. patients with periodontitis could harbor up to four clonal types of P. gingivalis. patients with refractory periodontitis could be colonized by up to eight clonal types. hypothesis could explain events of disease initiation and its bursts of activity. clonal stability exists in P. gingivalis colonization over time, or if new (and more pathogenic) clones would arise and coincide with onset of periodontitis. the association between the stably colonizing clones and disease progression was not examined. however, the relationship between the presence of the posttherapy isolates found by Valenza et al. (374) and the response to periodontal treatment was also not tested. however, inferences regarding their association with the progression of periodontitis and periodontal therapy outcomes could not be made. the description of a core set of genes present in a species is a first step. the core genome of P. gingivalis has been found to be 46% of the average core genome. the core genome of E. coli has been found to be 46% of the average core genome. no set of clones harboring a set of genes has been implicated in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases. molecular techniques, rather than culture, are required to study the microbiota of periodontal diseases. s appeared to be associated with periodontal diseases as the percentage of total isolates increased with increased disease severity. the checkerboard DNA\u2013DNA hybridization technique (339, 341) came to fulfill such a need and allowed the enumeration of a multitude of taxa in many samples simultaneously. it allowed the enumeration of a multitude of taxa in many samples simultaneously. a subset of the taxa known to colonize the oral cavity was included in the probe panel routinely used. only cultured species could be included because of the requirement to grow bacteria for DNA extraction and probe preparation. reactions with F. nucleatum ssp. nucleatum and F. nucleatum ssp. polymorphum exhibited virtually no crossreactions except for expected reactions with C. rectus. crossreactions observed could be eliminated with subtraction hybridization and PCR probes, as well as with competitive hybridization. over 50% of morphotypes present in plaque samples can be grown in the laboratory. it is a testimony to the quality of the work of the pioneers in periodontal microbiology. a highly sensitive method (PCR) (122) would allow the identification of all microbial taxa present in a given sample. a few groups began using cloning and sequencing to explore the microbial diversity in the oral cavity of patients with periodontitis. the authors estimated that 500 taxa could colonize the oral cavity. novel phylotypes include desulfobulbus clone R004 and Eubacterium clone PUS9.170. cultured pathogenic periodontal species were also detected and associated with periodontitis. five uncultured/unnamed phylotypes were associated with periodontal diseases. the most striking finding of early studies was the infrequent detection of recognized periodontal pathogens such as P. gingivalis and T. forsythia. new concepts tend to replace old dogmas as new knowledge is obtained. differences between data obtained from cloning and sequencing may have clouded differences between periodontal health and disease. closeended approaches using real timePCR have been able to routinely detect classical periodontal pathogens even when few samples were collected or pooled (41, 55), suggesting that other procedures associated with cloning and sequencing could be the source. several aspects of the PCR amplification of multitemplate samples, including template concentration, number of amplification cycles, annealing temperature and chimera formation, could alter the microbial profiles of the sample. the nature of the cell wall of the species present in the sample will affect cell lysis and DNAextraction protocols. bacterial species showed primer and DNAisolation biases and an overestimation of diversity. the data from clinical and mock samples allowed the authors to devise an experimental and analytical framework that should facilitate the design and interpretation of future highthroughput sequencing studies. this is particularly important when using new techniques or exploring new environments. the authors used four sets of primers targeting different regions of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene to amplify subgingival biofilm samples from 10 patients with periodontitis. the authors observed significant differences across the microbial communities generated by different target regions. the authors found a total of 692 species, and the number of species per individual ranged from 100 to 300. uncultured subgingival species have been implicated in the etiology of periodontal diseases since the late 1800s. early studies using microscopy identified high levels and proportions of spirochetes in deep pockets. a taxon was found in gingivitis sites and corresponded to 1% of the total bacteria. this taxon was found in gingivitis sites and corresponded to 1% of the total bacteria. but it was detected in all gingivitis sites and comprised >10% of the total bacteria. a number of additional studies are needed in order for the role of these novel taxa to be elucidated, including intervention studies to test whether the prevalence of those new \u2018putative pathogens\u2019 would decrease in successfully treated patients and sites. longitudinal studies are also necessary to confirm the consistent presence of these taxa in the subgingival habitat. the human oral microbial identification microarray is a 16S ribosomal RNA-based microarray method that allows the simultaneous detection of about 300 of the most prevalent oral bacterial taxa. the major advantage of the human oral microbial identification microarray over sequencing and cloning is its relatively high throughput, affording the examination of a much larger number of samples. spp. HOT 134 and HOT 442 were associated with attachment loss. uncultured taxa previously associated with disease were also more prevalent in poor responders. differences did not reach statistical significance. Fusobacterium sp. HOT 203, Peptostreptococcaceae sp. HOT 113, a cluster of Synergistetes phylotypes, Treponema spp. HOT 242 and HOT 237 and TM7 spp. HOT 349 and HOT 346 were significantly reduced after therapy. the effects of therapy on the microbiota implicated a number of other taxa as candidate pathogens. the detection of bacterial taxa detected at significantly different frequencies before and after therapy (P 0.05) sites with a pocket depth of 4 mm are shown in blue, those with a pocket depth of 4\u20136 mm are shown in orange and those with a pocket depth of >6 mm are shown in red. only taxa that presented a significantly different prevalence across site categories were plotted. a potential role in health and disease could be suggested for cultured taxa not typically sought in studies of the subgingival microbiota, such as D. pneumosintes, F. alocis, P. denticola and Fusobacterium naviforme. RNAoligonucleotide quantification technique is a highthroughput method to quantify a wide range of uncultured and unnamed taxa in oral biofilms. it involves the use of digoxigeninlabeled oligonucleotide sequences targeting the 16S ribosomal DNA gene that are hybridized with the total nucleic acids. the RNAoligonucleotide quantification technique targets primarily the ribosomal RNA molecule, which is far more abundant than the ribosomal RNA gene. the second benefit of this approach is that it targets primarily the ribosomal RNA molecule, which is far more abundant than the ribosomal RNA gene. the number of ribosomal RNA copies will differ across taxa and their stage of growth, which complicates the conversion of pM units into cell counts. the ribosomal RNA content might change over at least one order of magnitude during the bacterial cell cycle (13). the role of the ribosomes as protein factories is so crucial that changes in the cellular ribosomal RNA of specific populations are highly significant. the human oral microbiome database (http://www.homd.com) (51) was developed to provide a provisional naming scheme where each human oral taxon is given a unique number. this HOT number is linked to their source, curated sequence information, synonyms, taxonomic hierarchy, bibliographic information and status (i.e. cultured, or unnamed cultured/uncultured) the human oral microbial identification microarray is a 16S ribosomal RNA-based microarray method that allows the simultaneous detection of about 300 of the most prevalent oral bacterial taxa. the major advantage of the human oral microbial identification microarray over sequencing and cloning is its relatively high throughput. sp. HOT 113, Desulfobulbus sp. HOT 041, Fusobacterium sp. HOT 203 and Selenomonas spp. HOT 442 were associated with attachment loss. additional, uncultured taxa previously associated with disease, including Mitsuokella (Acidaminococcacea sp. HOT 131), were also more prevalent in poor responders. the authors used the human oral microbial identification microarray to compare the changes on the subgingival microbiota of the two clinical groups of periodontitis patients described earlier in this paragraph. the authors observed that Fusobacterium sp. HOT 203, Peptostreptococcaceae sp. HOT 113, a cluster of Synergistetes phylotypes, Treponema spp. HOT 242 and HOT 237 bulbus sp. HOT 041, Peptostreptococcacea spp. HOT 103 and HOT 369 and Treponema spp. HOT 237 and HOT 242 were detected at greater frequencies in deep sites. acidaminococcaceae (Veillonellaceae sp.) sp. HOT 150 was more prevalent in healthy sites. spp. HOT 363, HOT 453 and HOT 452 were more prevalent in deep residual sites. other taxa that were also found at a higher prevalence in that category of sites included P. gingivalis and E. nodatum. ergistetes, Megasphaera, Selenomonas, Desulfobulbus, Peptostreptococcacea and Acidaminococcacea were previously associated with periodontal diseases. a potential role in health and disease could be suggested for cultured taxa not typically sought in studies of the subgingival microbiota. RNAoligonucleotide quantification technique is a highthroughput method. it involves the use of digoxigeninlabeled oligonucleotide sequences targeting the 16S ribosomal DNA gene that are hybridized with the total nucleic acids extracted from biofilm samples. sequences used in the RNAoligonucleotide quantification technique are the same sequences used in the human oral microbial identification microarray. in order to permit quantification, sequences complementary to the probes are used as standards and are added to the membranes. the first benefit of this approach is that an abundant target molecule obviates the need for the PCRamplification step. the number of ribosomal RNA copies will differ across taxa and their stage of growth, which complicates the conversion of pM units into cell counts. the ribosomal RNA content might change over at least one order of magnitude during the bacterial cell cycle. the human oral microbiome database (http://www.homd.com) contains 645 taxa. about 50% are named species, about 16% are unnamed cultured taxa. about 34% represent uncultured phylotypes. culture and culture techniques are required to study the microbiota of periodontal diseases. it is probable that at least two techniques combined will be necessary (e.g. culture and molecular methods) samples were collected from a wide range of ecosystems, including root canals, caries lesions, lakes and oceans. the largest overlap between the two approaches was 30% in caries samples and 20% in endodontic samples. the study could not demonstrate that molecular approaches captured a wider spectrum of microbial diversity. checkerboard DNA\u2013DNA hybridization data from 2,565 individual subgingival plaque samples were used to validate the algorithms used in the correlation network analysis. many of the modules identified by DuranPinedo et al.

(337) study is using RNAoligonucleotide quantification technique to identify prominent, uncultured, but currently unnamed, subgingival taxa associated with periodontal health or disease. the secondary objective of this study is to recover in pure culture \u2018easy\u2019toculture taxa. in the process, we will determine which taxa are truly \u2018unculturable\u2019. 92 probes included in our probe panel are listed in decreasing order of prevalence in periodontitis patients. the top 10 probes detected their targets in more than 16% of subjects evaluated. 25 probes never yielded a positive signal.

HOT 081, Megaesphera sp. HOT 123, and unnamed cultured taxa, such as p. HOT 274 were more abundant in deep periodontitis sites than in the shallow sites of healthy individuals (P 0.0001) the magnitude of the differences was comparable to that of P. gingivalis. only taxa with significantly different prevalence between the site categories were plotted. isolates will be dispersed, serially diluted, plated on five isolation media and grown in three different atmospheres. colonies that give positive signals on each medium/atmosphere combination will be counted and the data used to select the three best media/atmosphere combinations that provided the greatest recovery of unnamed taxa. the model was built based on the frequency of the simultaneous occurrence of a group of taxa irrespective of their spatial distribution within the biofilm. the physical interaction and the spatial distribution of the species identified are disrupted and therefore they cannot be inferred using this technique. study of subgingival microbiota prevented a comprehensive study of microbial community organization. limitations in current technologies have prevented a comprehensive study of microbial community organization (375) cells of prevotella and Actinomyces showed the most interspecies associations, suggesting a central role for these genera in establishing and maintaining biofilm complexity. work is underway at The Forsyth Institute, in collaboration with Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratories (Woods Hole, MA, USA) to expand the probe panel used initially and explore the spatial organization of the oral microbiome to include biofilms associated with different oral surfaces. the study of the microbial challenge will not be sufficient. the immunoinflammatory response that accompanies the bacterial challenge is clearly part of the constellation of minimal causes that lead to periodontal tissue destruction. some authors hypothesize that they might outweigh bacteria as determinants of periodontal disease onset and severity (266) a host response is mediated entirely by the host or by the host response. a host response is not present in the periodontium without elimination of radicular plaque infections. bacterial products, such as proteases and lipopolysaccharides, can cause direct tissue damage (282) and stimulate bone resorption (84), hostderived molecules, such as matrix metalloproteinases and interleukin1, are more potent mediators of these catabolic processes. most of the tissue destruction observed in periodontal diseases results from indirect damage mediated by the immunoinflammatory response. the most efficient strategies in place for the prevention and treatment of periodontal diseases are antiinfect the only therapeutic adjunct on the market for periodontal disease therapy that interferes with the host response is lowdose doxycycline (Periostat\u00ae) the mechanism by which this drug is understood to control periodontal tissue destruction is through its anticollagenolytic activity. however, it has been demonstrated that the use of lowdose doxycycline also results in changes in the proportion of subgingival bacterial species that are resistant to doxycycline. the use of fluorides is a good example of how interfering with pathogenesis, rather than etiology, might lead to a successful strategy for disease control. the analogy is flawed because the pathogenesis of dental caries involves a biochemical reaction, rather than an immunoinflammatory response. rabbit model of periodontitis demonstrated topical applications of resolvin E1 prevented the onset and progression of destructive periodontal disease. resolvin E1 was capable of inducing regeneration of periodontal tissues, including new periodontal ligament, cementum and alveolar bone. resolvins may have promoted the release of antimicrobial peptides, such as defensins and bactericidal/permeabilityincreasing protein. findings highlight the intimate relationship between the composition of the microbial community and the local environment. the authors concluded that proresolving mediators had antiphlogistic actions, enhanced the containment of infectious agents and lowered the dose of antibiotic required for bacterial clearance. the effects of resolvins on the prevention of destructive periodontal diseases might be explained by indirect antimicrobial mechanisms. polarization of Thelper cells into Thelper 1, Thelper 2 or Tregulatory cell subsets is a major determinant of the nature of Tcell responses. bacterial antigens from Bacteroides fragilis, S. mitis and P. acnes primed human dendritic cells to induce Thelper 1 cell. a. actinomycetemcomitans can also modulate Tcell immunity by downregulating the expression of cytokines such as interferon, interleukin12 and interleukin8 (296). also, A. actinomycetemcomitans is capable of modulating Tcell responses through several mechanisms, including induction of Tcell apoptosis (252), expression of superantigens (406) and preferential stimulation of Tcells secreting interleukin4 interleukin6 knockout mice and the neutralization of interleukin6 using antibodies resulted in significantly higher periapical bone resorption (29) the lessons learned from the studies on sepsis might be quite relevant. the lessons learned from the studies on sepsis might be quite relevant. examining the functions of cytokines solely under the \u2018protective vs.

immunoinflammatory response in periodontal diseases. the same statement would apply to the study of the immunoinflammatory response in periodontal diseases. transcriptome of gingival tissues during experimental gingivitis has also been recently characterized (262) 131 immune response related genes were significantly upregulated or downregulated during the induction and/or resolution of gingivitis. new candidate genes and pathways were identified as being altered during experimental gingivitis, including neural processes, epithelial defenses, angiogenesis and wound healing. the bottom bars represent the entire spread of the data points for the participants, excluding \u2018extreme\u2019 points. the filled triangle indicates the mean value, and the open triangle indicates the median value. the study of the microbiota of periodontal health and disease has been \u2018limited\u2019 to its composition. the key to assess expression analysis in whole microbial communities is the linear amplification of small quantities of RNA extracted from the bacterial assemblages. the final amplified RNA is a direct representation of the relative abundance of mRNA in the original sample. pyrosequencing techniques now allow for the sequencing of large amounts of DNA. pooled samples from 74 sites from a periodontally healthy subject were pooled. phylogenetic assignments of metatranscriptomic reads were performed using blat results. the figure shows the comparison between reads from healthy patients and patients with periodontal disease. phylogenetic assignments of metatranscriptomic reads were performed using software for analyzing metagenomes. numbers of reads were normalized to database size. reads from healthy patients are in white and reads from patients with periodontal disease are in red.
