{"summary": "three gene therapies have been approved by the fda. non-viral systems are less immunogenic than viral systems. a more transient regulation of gene expression may be preferred in other contexts. nucleic acids vary in size and contain either ribose or deoxyribose. lipids and polymers are the most common materials used for delivery of nucleic acids. lipids and polymers are the most common materials used for delivery of nucleic acids. cationic polymers poly-L-lysine (PLL) and polyethylenimine (PEI) were the earliest polymers used for condensing DNA. cationic polymers poly-L-lysine (PLL) and polyethylenimine (PEI) were the earliest polymers used for condensing DNA. I into mixed polymer NPs allows for effective gene delivery in vivo. the neutral polymer polyethylene glycol (PEG) has also been used to reduce electrostatic interactions of both polymer and lipid-based NPs in vivo. 155 PEGylated polymeric NP (polypeptide) Galactose 100 +5 Liu L. et al., 2017 siRNA CSF-1R PEGylated cationic phospholipid monolayer ApoA 1-mimetic -helical peptide linked to M2 macrophage binding protein 20 nr Qian et al., 2015b siRNA MIF Polymeric NP (glucan) Glucan 80\u2013120 n yl anisamide 50 +25 Miao et al., 2015 pDNA soluble TRAIL PEGylated cationic liposome Amino-ethyl anisamide 70 +25 Miao et al., 2017b pDNA PD-L1 and CXCL12 traps PEGylated cationic liposome Amino-ethyl anisamide 70 nr Miao et al., solid tumors also have stroma that contains non-cancerous constituents that include fibroblasts, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), endothelial cells and extracellular matrix components. delivery to tumor-associated cells in the TME may be beneficial for local and sustained release of drug. TME cell types, their role in cancer biology, and surface markers commonly used to target them are summarized in Figure 1. Targeting the tumor microenvironment (TME) ionizable lipids are positively charged in mildly acidic conditions where they can complex with nucleic acids. polymers can occur as a single repeating unit (homopolymers) or multiple unit types. polymers with discrete segments consisting of different repeating units can be made with a variety of useful properties. cationic polymers poly-L-lysine (PLL) and polyethylenimine (PEI) were the earliest polymers used for condensing DNA. target cell type Type of nucleic acid Target gene(s) Formulation material Targeting moiety Size (nm) Surface charge (mV) Reference Macrophage siRNA PPIB Amphipathic triblock copolymers (polymeric micelle) Mannose nr nr +20 Ortega et al., 2015 siRNA IB Amphipathic triblock copolymers (polymeric micelle) Mannose nr nr +20 Ortega e na nr nr Cubillos-Ruiz et al., 2009 siRNA SOCS1 Polymeric NP (PLGA-PLL) na 150\u201329 Heo et al., 2014 siRNA or CpG oligonucleotide IL-10 Polymeric NP (PLGA-PLL) na 100\u2013200 \u201320 Heo et al., 2015 miRNA miR-155 Polymeric NP (PEI anti-miR miR-132 Cationic liposome V3 ligand 100\u2013200 nr Anand et al., 2010 miRNA miR-200a and b Polymeric NP (Chitosan-TPP) RGD 100\u2013200 +40 Hood et al., 2002 siRNA CD31, Tie2 PEGylated cationic liposome na 100\u2013200 nr Santel et al., 2006 siRNA non-cancerous constituents include fibroblasts, tumor-associated macrophages, endothelial cells and extracellular matrix components. delivery to NPs loaded with small molecule drugs may be beneficial for local and sustained release of drug. caution is warranted. many barriers to gene delivery are universal to all oligonucleotide species. stability in circulation, cell uptake, and endosomal escape. DNA must additionally be delivered to the nuclear compartment to permit access to transcriptional machinery. the robust immunostimmulatory effect of CpG DNA makes it a potentially useful vaccine adjuvant. Alternatively, the immune effects of CpG can be removed by altering the DNA sequence to replace CpG-S motifs. no therapies have been approved by the FDA thus far, several non-viral DNA strategies are being evaluated clinically. non-viral DNA therapeutics will pave the way for non-viral DNA in cancer therapy and other diseases. mRNA The goal of mRNA delivery is the same as DNA delivery. mRNA delivery does not pose the risk of insertional mutagenesis. commercial kits are available to synthesize mRNA with all necessary structural components from plasmid DNA. there are over a dozen clinical trials using mRNA for vaccines, adjuvants, or to express antigens either in dendritic cells ex vivo or by direct injection. gene replacement therapy is still in pre-clinical development. each miRNA can target hundreds of unique mRNAs. miRNAs are critical regulators of cell identity and state. synthetic double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) carrying the same sequence as the endogenous mature or precursor miRNA can be used. miRNA siRNAs are 21 nt dsRNAs that interact in the cytoplasm with the RISC complex to degrade target mRNAs. in structure, siRNAs are identical to miRNAs and can be modified and encapsulated in the same way. the primary difference between miRNAs and siRNAs is the sequence specificity. miRNAs cause translational repression of target mRNAs by association with other Argonaut complexes devoid of nuclease activity. pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of miRNA mimics and siRNAs are the same, since their chemical structure is identical. stimulation of immune responses by exogenous RNA can induce an inflammatory cytokine response that is greater than either component alone. therapeutic delivery of non-coding RNAs will face similar challenges to other types of RNA, such as stability and uptake into appropriate cells and intracellular compartments. the enthusiasm surrounding genome editing technology is reminiscent of that generated by the discovery of RNAi. CRISPR-Cas9 is being used to remove the CCR5 receptor from hematopoietic stem cells as a therapeutic strategy for HIV. removing this receptor is expected to reduce the ability of HIV to infect transplanted cells. application of this technique to other cell-based therapies could soon follow. important safety concerns for DNA delivery are immune stimulation and risk of insertional mutagenesis. the risk of insertional mutagenesis is much higher for viral delivery systems but cannot be excluded for episomal pDNA. non-viral DNA therapeutics will pave the way for non-viral DNA in cancer therapy and other diseases. mRNA delivery is the same as DNA delivery, to deliver a therapeutic gene that will be translated into protein within target cells. mRNA delivery does not pose the risk of insertional mutagenesis. the structure of mRNA is critical for recognition by the immune system. a 5\u2032 methyl cap and a 3\u2032 poly adenosine tail book-end the mRNA and are necessary for efficient translation. commercial kits are available to synthesize mRNA with all necessary structural components from plasmid DNA. the mature 22 nucleotide miRNA associates with the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), and one or both strands guide RISC to complementary sequences within target mRNA. target sequences complimentary to the 2\u20137 nucleotide \u201cseed\u201d region of the miRNA sequence are frequently found in the 3\u2032 UTR of mRNAs. nucleic acid based inhibitors of miRNAs include locked-nucleic acids (LNAs), antagomirs, anti-miRs, and miR-sponges. therapeutic strategies modulating miRNA function are already in clinical trials. inhibition of miR103/107 is in clinical trials for alcoholic fatty liver disease. siRNAs are identical to miRNAs and can be modified and encapsulated in the same way. miRNA mimics are based on endogenous genes while siRNAs are synthetically designed. the primary difference between miRNAs and siRNAs is the sequence specificity. dozens of clinical trials of siRNA-based therapies have been completed. non-coding RNAs include piwi-interacting RNAs, endogenous siRNAs, long-non-coding RNAs, and circular RNAs. therapeutic approaches to modulate non-coding RNAs will be of increasing interest. CRISPR-Cas9 is a highly specific gene editing tool. it requires the presence of a Cas9 protein and single guide RNA (sgRNA) to be present in the same cell. the first use of CRISPR-Cas9 in clinical trials has already taken place. macrophages are characterized by high levels of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, pro-inflammatory cytokines and inducible nitric oxide synthase 2 (Nos2) Conversely, M2 macrophages express low levels of these markers and instead express high levels of arginase-1 and scavenger receptors like the mannose receptor (MR) macrophages take up both 300 nm PEG hydrogel NPs and 30 nm quantum dots. this phenomenon does not extend to microparticles. single cell pharmacokinetics of NPs within tumors has revealed that TAMs can serve as reservoirs for NPs, releasing small molecule drugs. the uptake of chitosan NPs with charges ranging from -40 to +35 was examined for murine macrophages. large NPs 300\u2013500 nm in size are taken up more efficiently than 150 nm particles by murine macrophages. however, further cell-type specificity can be achieved with targeting moieties. mice with fewer TAMs have reduced tumor uptake of MR-targeted nanobodies. mannosylated polymeric micelles are able to deliver siRNA and mediate TAM gene silencing in vitro and in vivo. the galactose-type C lectin receptor has also been targeted for macrophage nucleic acid delivery. anti-CSF-1R siRNA targeted to TAMs reduced tumor growth by 87%. non-targeted particles also inhibited tumor growth, but not as dramatically. pro-inflammatory miR-155 was delivered in redox and pH sensitive NPs. recruitment of IMs relies on the chemokine CCL2 or its cognate receptor CCR2. inhibition of CCR2 in monocytes reduced tumor size and number of TAMs. however, the ability to silence genes in monocytes has demonstrated clear therapeutic potential. NPs from 20 nm to 3 m are readily taken up by dendritic cells. the size of NPs and their ability to present multivalent antigens clearly points to vaccine applications. an increasing number of NP-based vaccines with or without additional immune agonists are being designed for cancer therapy. MR and DEC-205 are commonly used for NP or vaccine targeting. other targets have also been tested, including targets that enhance uptake in subsets of DCs. PLGA (R837/STAT3 siRNA) NPs were taken up efficiently by DCs, elicited cytokine response, antigen cross-presentation, and trafficking of DCs to draining lymph nodes. IL-10 is an immunosuppressive cytokine and its inhibition further enhanced the immune response. tDCs have a particularly tolerogenic role in ovarian cancer models. delivery of miR-155 mimics produced potent anti-tumor effects. about 33% of mice showed no disease progression 80 days after controls had succumbed to disease. a bulged dsRNA that required processing by DICER was most effective at gene silencing. respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was delivered in chitosan NPs targeted with anti-DEC-205 antibody. NP DNA delivery successfully stimulated IgG and IgA antibodies against SARS-CoV nucleocapsid, in contrast to naked DNA, which produced no detectable antibody response. this approach could be translated to cancer immunotherapy as well. cisplatin NPs with or without targeting are taken up by CAFs in desmoplastic pancreatic tumors. damage to fibroblasts initially reduces their supportive role. however, chronic exposure induces expression and release of soluble factors such as Wnt16. T-cells are important mediators of anti-tumor immunity. receptors PD-1 and CTLA4 expressed on T-cells promote exhaustion. new approaches to further harness the power of T-cells are being developed. transient permeabilization is achieved by adding gold NPs to CD8+ T-cells. this strategy had lower cytotoxicity than nucleofection with comparable siRNA-mediated gene knockdown. NP delivery of mRNAs to T-cells effectively removed the ability of T-cells to produce their own TCRs. despite more than 200 clinical trials for CAR-T cells, none currently use NP-based methods. these NP systems rely on antibodies to surface proteins expressed on T-cells. b7 targeting antibody was used to deliver lipid-based NPs containing siRNAs to leukocytes. healthy vasculature is quiescent due to a controlled balance between pro- (e.g., VEGF and FGF) and anti- (e.g., angiostatin and thrombospondin) angiogenic factors that regulate endothelial cell proliferation and migration. tumors hijack this regulation and permanently shift the balance to a pathologic, pro-angiogenic state during the \u201cangiogenic switch\u201d. chitosan NPs have been shown to co-localize to both tumor and endothelial cells in vivo and effectively deliver siRNAs to both cell types. chitosan NPs carrying siRNAs targeting human EZH2 or murine EZH2 inhibited tumor growth. however, the NPs carrying murine targeting siRNA had more potent therapeutic effects than targeting cancer cells directly. -200 family members using this approach reduced angiogenesis by direct and indirect mechanisms. RGD-chitosan mediated delivery of siRNA targeting PLXDC1 has been shown to effectively silence target gene expression in endothelial cells. the V3 integrin also facilitates uptake of viral genomic material. mononuclear cells macrophages Tumor-associated macrophages are often pro-tumoral by promoting angiogenesis, invasion, metastasis, and immune tolerance. macrophages are often characterized by the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory characteristics as \u201cM1\u201d or \u201cM2\u201d macrophages, respectively. mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS), also called reticuloendothelial system (RES), considered a critical obstacle to NP drug delivery. one example of this is the first FDA approved NP drug Doxil, a nanoliposome formulation of doxorubicin. macrophage NP uptake can occur through micropinocytosis, phagocytosis, and receptor-mediated endocytosis. a positive surface charge facilitates uptake by many types of cells having a negative membrane potential. a positive surface charge facilitates uptake by many types of cells having a negative membrane potential. cell surface receptors can be used to decorate the NP surface. MR, MR, cluster of differentiation 163 (CD163), legumanin, galactose-type C-type lectins, and cluster of differentiation 11b (CD11b) MR is upregulated in M2-like TAMs with decreased MHC II expression. nanocomplexes incorporating glucan, a PAMP associated with fungi, were shown to target TAMs. further targeting with receptor specific ligands or antibodies can facilitate uptake. discrimination between macrophages and other mononuclear cells has not been demonstrated. oligonucleotide delivery can be used to reprogram TAMs from an M1 to M2 phenotype to promote anti-tumor effects. recruitment of IMs relies on the chemokine CCL2 or its cognate receptor CCR2. inhibition of CCR2 in monocytes reduced tumor size and number of TAMs. dendritic cells recognize foreign materials through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) or compliment binding leading to phagocytosis. cross presentation of antigens from DCs to CD8+ T-cells is required for anti-tumor immunity. the size of NPs and their ability to present multivalent antigens clearly points to vaccine applications. antibodies against DEC-205 fused with a tumor antigen induced humoral and cellular immunity in patients with advanced malignancies. however, in some cases the material composition of the NP carrier may be more important than targeting ligands. et al. (2014) used polymeric micelles to deliver a tumor antigen and siRNA for the immunosuppressive Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 (SOCS1) to dendritic cells in vitro. delivery of SOCS1 siRNA increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by cultured DCs. miRNA can also be delivered to tDCs to induce anti-tumor immunity. NP delivery of XBP1 or IRE1 siRNA reduced metastasis and increased survival in ovarian cancer models. miR-155 mimics produced potent anti-tumor effects. mRNAs encoded in the DNA or mRNA can be expressed in myocytes or keratinocytes at the injection site. proteins encoded in the DNA or mRNA can be expressed in myocytes or keratinocytes at the injection site, and then translated into protein. macrophages Tumor-associated macrophages are often pro-tumoral by promoting angiogenesis, invasion, metastasis, and immune tolerance. macrophages are often characterized by the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory characteristics as \u201cM1\u201d or \u201cM2\u201d macrophages, respectively. most NP platforms are in the size range of viruses (20\u2013250 nm) and bacteria (0.2\u201310 m), and therefore they are readily taken up by phagocytic cells of the immune system. the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS), also called the reticuloendothelial system (RES), has been considered a critical obstacle to NP drug delivery. macrophage NP uptake can occur through micropinocytosis, phagocytosis, and receptor-mediated endocytosis. a positive surface charge facilitates uptake by many types of cells having a negative membrane potential. a positive surface charge facilitates uptake by many types of cells having a negative membrane potential. cell surface receptors can be used to enhance macrophage uptake. apolipoprotein A1 mimetic (-peptide A1 mimetic) can be used to decorate the NP surface. apolipoprotein A1 mimetic has also been targeted for macrophage nucleic acid delivery by attaching its ligand galactose to the surface of NPs. a ligand for SR-1B was linked to a M2 macrophage binding protein (M2pep) to deliver NP-encapsulated siRNAs. nanocomplexes incorporating glucan, a PAMP associated with fungi, were shown to target TAMs. further targeting with receptor specific ligands or antibodies can facilitate uptake. oligonucleotide delivery can be used to reprogram TAMs from an M1 to M2 phenotype to promote anti-tumor effects. inflammatory monocytes (IMs) can give rise to TAMs and other myeloid suppressor cells which promote angiogenesis and subsequent metastasis. dendritic cells recognize foreign materials through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) or compliment binding leading to phagocytosis. cross presentation of antigens from DCs to CD8+ T-cells is required for anti-tumor immunity. antibodies against DEC-205 fused with a tumor antigen induced humoral and cellular immunity in patients with advanced malignancies. however, in some cases the material composition of the NP carrier may be more important than targeting ligands. peptides and adjuvants to DCs can further enhance anti-tumor immune responses. multifunctional polymeric NPs carried tumor model antigen OVA, dendritic cell activator imiquimod (R837), and siRNAs for STAT3. tDCs have a particularly tolerogenic role in ovarian cancer models. miRNA can also be delivered to tDCs to induce anti-tumor immunity. NP delivery of XBP1 or IRE1 siRNA reduced metastasis. DNA vaccines have relied on non-specific targeting of injected DNA. this approach could be translated to cancer immunotherapy. but consideration of particle size may be critical to induce a cytotoxic T-cell response. multifunctional NPs are designed to deliver antigens and adjuvants to DCs. they are intimately involved in the anti-tumor response. these qualities have generated increased interest in NP-based vaccines. several studies have shown that delivery of pDNA encoding \u201ctraps\u201d can be successfully delivered to CAFs in vivo for cancer therapy. fusion proteins are secreted and ultimately bound to soluble factors in the TME, such as chemokines and cytokines. by inhibiting these factors, metastasis and immunosuppression have been shown to be reduced. new approaches to further harness the power of T-cells are being developed in many areas, including nanomedicine. the incorporation of efficient and transient gene expression with NP platforms to produce engineered T-cells holds promise for improved immunotherapies. TAL nuclease mediated elimination of the T-cell receptor alpha constant region (TRAC) effectively removed the ability of T-cells to produce their own TCRs and resulted in the specific expression of the CAR. this approach may foreseeably reduce off-target immune responses, but was not tested in vivo. internalization, not endosomal escape, may be the limiting factor for T-cell gene delivery. intriguingly, CD4 subsets with high or low CD4 expression had different rates of internalization and subsequent gene silencing. moffett et al. report NP delivery of mRNAs to T-cells using anti-CD3 and anti-CD8 antibody targeting. delivery of megaTAL nuclease mediated elimination of the T-cell receptor alpha constant region effectively removed the ability of T-cells to produce their own TCRs. integrin targeting antibody was used to deliver lipid-based NPs to leukocytes. delivery of siRNAs to CCR5, a critical receptor for HIV entry, decreased susceptibility of humanized mice to HIV infection. lipid NPs can specifically deliver siRNA to T-cells in vivo. chitosan NPs have been demonstrated to co-localize to both tumor and endothelial cells in vivo and effectively deliver siRNAs to both cell types. chitosan NPs have been demonstrated to co-localize to both tumor and endothelial cells in vivo. second-generation NPs rely on incorporation of ligands to target endothelial cell-specific surface proteins. ligands to integrin V3 can be used to facilitate NP uptake into neo-vasculature. chitosan-mediated delivery of siRNA targeting PLXDC1 has been shown to effectively silence target gene expression in endothelial cells. ligand-based targeting is chemically modified dendrimers that can specifically target the endothelium. 7C1 NPs are another type of NP that localize faithfully and specifically to the endothelium in multiple models of aberrant vascular function. biology has taught us that non-transformed cells can act as accessories to cancer growth and spread. but strategies to reprogram the TME could lead to revolutionary therapies."}
