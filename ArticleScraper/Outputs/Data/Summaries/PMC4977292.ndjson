{"summary": "ZIKV has been detected in the placenta and amniotic fluid of fetuses born with microcephaly. it has also been detected in the brain of a fetus died of severe brain defects. retinol is a non-peptide small lipophilic molecule derived from retinol. it is converted to retinal and further into retinoic acid by the action of dehydrogenases. retinoic acid is taken to the nucleus by the cellular retinoic acid binding protein (CRABP) retinoic acid is a teratogen and can cause the neural tube defect and other brain malformations if provided in abnormal doses. retinoic acid is also a teratogen and can cause the neural tube defect. fetal microcephaly ZIKV mediated retinoic acid signaling dysregulation. cDNA is reverse-transcribed into cDNA by reverse transcriptase. if inserted DNA sequences match regulatory regions of certain host genes then they may influence expression in a way that the developing fetus manifests. retinoic acid-mediated mechanism involved in ZIKV-microcephaly association. the virus might act through disruption of normal retinoic acid signaling mediated by incorporation of these sequences into the DNA of developing host brain cells. retinoic acid is a non-peptide small lipophilic molecule derived from retinol. any dysregulation of this intricate molecular process at any step can lead to various degrees of neural tube defects and brain malformations. the RARE sequence is also spread all over human genome through commonly found ALU repeats which contain RARE sequence. retinoic acid enjoys the stature of being the initial-most molecular factor involved in the determination of the neural axis. disruptions in the retinoic acid signaling pathway have been implicated in ensuing brain defects in developing fetus involving all the above mentioned structures. retinoic acid is also a teratogen and can cause the neural tube defect and other brain malformations if provided in abnormal doses to developing fetus. current understanding of the ZIKV-microcephaly association is improving. many recent studies strongly agree to the notion that ZIKV-microcephaly may be a developmental brain malformation rather than a mere brain destruction by the virus. we also screened some other viruses and subjected them to the same analysis. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank screened for the presence of RARE consensus sequence (5\u2032\u2013AGGTCA\u20133\u2032) among the viruses other than ZIKV, selection was made under four groups. a Perl script was written and executed. a PERL script was generated in order to find and count the RARE sequences from the ZIKA virus genome. the PERL script was based on the window shift algorithm. the complete PERL script for this study is available as Supplementary Material. Result The ZIKV strains associated with microcephaly contained RARE consensus sequence repeats. the number of repeats correspond to the virulence of each strain. number of RARE consensus sequence (5\u2032\u2013AGGTCA\u20133\u2032) repeats in genomic sequence of other viruses. other Viruses Strains (GenBank accession number in brackets) Type Length of reading frame Number of RARE Sequences (5\u2032\u2013AGGTCA\u20133\u2032) repeats in genomic sequence of other viruses. ssRNA, linear 10862 bp 3 + Findlay and Stern, 1935; Guimard et al., 2009 Estern Equine encephalitis Virus (KJ659366.1) (+)ssRNA, linear 11613 bp 5 + Ludlow et al., 2016 *Human cytomegalovirus (Human herpesvirus 5) (NC_006273.2) ds-DNA, linear 235646 bp Koyuncu et al., 2013 Hepatitis C virus (subtype 1 g) AM910652 (+)ssRNA, linear 9490 bp 4 + + Forton et al., 2001; Grover et al., 2001; Koyuncu et al., 2013 human Corona virus HKU1 KF430201.1 (+)ssRNA, linear 29934 bp 3 + Lau et al., 2006 SARS Corona virus fetal loss and/or non-evaluation of the dead still birth baby for brain defects. the genome of the Brazilian ZIKV strain was found to share near 100% homology to the polynesian strain. the retrieved strain had a close homology to the polynesian strain. the presence of the RARE consensus sequence repeats revealed in the known neurotropic viruses could be an indication that retinoic acid signaling may have an important role to play in neurotropism. the presence of the RARE consensus sequence repeats revealed in the known neurotropic viruses (Table 3) could be an indication that retinoic acid signaling may have an important role to play in neurotropism. the high frequency of RARE consensus repeats in some double stranded DNA viruses may be because of larger reading frame length. this index could be an appropriate measure for representing potency of a virus for causing congenital brain malformation or neurotropism. the reason behind these striking resemblances could be that the retinoic acid signaling is crucially involved in development of the dorsal brain structures (Wilson et al., 2007; including cerebellum and brain stem), midline forebrain structures (Gupta and Sen, 2015; including choroid plexus which synthesizes CSF). the presence of microcephaly or other brain malformations in the fetuses born of the ZIKV infected mothers may also depend on the time-point of the fetal infection during neural tube formation. microcephalic features were detected on ultrasound beyond 20th week (Calvet et al., 2016; Hazin et al., 2016; Mlakar et al., 2016) a virus which contains RARE consensus sequence repeats shows neurotropism. it also shows neurotropism but its causal handcuff to microcephaly depends on its ability for maternal-fetal transmission. the mouse model study of a well-known fetal anomaly syndrome called \u201cCHARGE\u201d reported some anomalous features very similar to that found in fetal brains suspected of ZIKV microcephaly. the widespread cortical anomalies in ZIKV microcephaly get explained by an interesting study involving retinoic acid (Siegenthaler et al., 2009) neurospheres or brain organoids developed from human induced pluripotent cells. ZIKV has also been shown to induce cell death and attenuate growth mediated through vast transcriptomic alterations. disruption of the normal retinoic acid signaling in developing forebrain has been shown to induce death of neural precursor cells. our claim that ZIKV-microcephaly may involve retinoic acid signaling dysregulation is further bolstered by the fact that many of the toxins that involve retinoic acid also have microcephaly as a presenting feature. these malformations match to almost all the features described under ZIKV-microcephaly spectrum including enlarged cistern magna and calcifications in brain parenchyma. retinoic acid signaling dysregulation not able to explain multifocal calcifications widespread in basal ganglia, thalamus and cortical regions. retinoic acid signaling dysregulation is not able to explain multifocal calcifications widespread in the basal ganglia, thalamus and cortical regions. calcifications found in the ZIKV affected fetal brain are punctiform and appear as destroyed neuronal structure on histological examination. calcifications are due to the deposition of calcium compounds in the accumulation of viral invaded dead neurons (Mlakar et al., 2016) as the process of degeneration. Fetal brain defects in ZIKV-microcephaly closely resemble to brain malformation caused by dysregulation of retinoic acid signaling. retinoic acid signaling dysregulation has also been implicated as a common mechanism in many environmental or developmental reasons of microcephaly. retinoic acid signaling dysregulation may result in malformations similar to that noted in ZIKV caused microcephaly. the defect should be occurring in rostrocaudal sequencing of the brain structures in the developing neural tube. the presence of microcephaly or other brain malformations in the fetuses born of the ZIKV infected mothers may also depend on the time-point of the fetal infection during neural tube formation. a disruption at this stage would essentially result in features typically seen in ZIKV microcephaly (Calvet et al., 2016; Hazin et al., 2016; Mlakar et al., 2016) due to striking resemblance to the embryological malformations, the recent reports have stressed upon considering the fetal brain damage as a developmental problem rather than the brain destruction caused by viral invasion of neuronal cells. Japanese encephalitis virus ((+)ssRNA, linear, 10970 bp: Table 3) has no known evidence of maternal-fetal transmission in humans. but having shorter frame length and more number of RARE consensus sequence repeats (numbering to six) is known to show neurotropism. cranial meninges are a source of retinoic acid to the developing cortex. retinoic acid signaling has been extensively implicated in cortical genesis. many contemporary reports have confirmed that ZIKV has detrimental effects on human cortical progenitor cells. dysregulation of retinoic acid signaling has also been implicated in some demyelinating pathologies. many of the toxins that involve retinoic acid also have microcephaly as a presenting feature. pregnant women to the isotretinoin match to almost all features described under ZIKV-microcephaly spectrum. these malformations match to almost all the features described under ZIKV-microcephaly spectrum including enlarged cistern magna and calcifications in brain parenchyma. a plausible mosaic of a justified picture comes up supporting our proposition that ZIKV interferes with retinoic acid signaling in the developing brain. IKV infected fetuses show no abnormality of brain structures until 20th weeks of gestation is a mystery and needs to be explained. retinoic acid signaling dysregulation is not able to explain multifocal calcifications widespread in the basal ganglia, thalamus and cortical regions. the ZIKV strains which contain either equal or less number of RARE sequences than Brazilian strain can also cause microcephaly or not. but further availability of knowledge on the ZIKV strains implicated in microcephaly is indispensable. the immediate application of our study are immense.
