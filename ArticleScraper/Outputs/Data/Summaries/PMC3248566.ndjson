{"summary": "bluetongue is a major infectious disease of ruminants caused by an arbovirus (BTV) transmitted by biting midges (Culicoides spp.) [1]\u2013[3]. Historically, bluetongue has been endemic almost exclusively in temperate and tropical areas of the world where the climatic conditions favour both the spread of the susceptible insect vector population and the virus replication cycle within the vector. RNA dependent RNA polymerase, VP4 (capping enzyme and transmethylase) and VP6 (RNA dependent ATPase and helicase) are contained within the core that is transcriptionally active in infected cells. NS1 and NS2 are highly expressed viral proteins and their multimers are morphological features of BTV-infected cells. the ORFX putative initiation codon has a strong Kozak context suggesting that this protein might be translated by leaky scanning [29]. alternative reading frames are expressed in a variety of RNA viruses and they can play fundamental roles in viral replication and virus-host interaction. KC cells were grown in Schneider's insect medium and supplemented with 10% FBS. pNS47\u201377-GFP, pNS413\u201377-GFP and pNS419\u201377-GFP maintain the methionine and valine residues in position 1 and 2 of NS4. each BTV genome segment was amplified by RT-PCR using the AccuScript PfuUltra II RT-PCR Kit (Agilent) from either BTV-1 or BTV-8 dsRNA preparations. resulting PCR products were gel-purified (Qiagen) and cloned into either pUC57 (Fermentas) or pCI. oort Veterinary Institute was adapted to cell culture by passing it twice in embryonated eggs and 9 times in BHK21 cells. supernatants were clarified by centrifugation at 500 g for 5 min. resulting virus suspensions aliquoted and stored at 4\u00b0C for short term usage and at 70\u00b0C for long term storage. monolayers of 95% confluent BSR cells grown in 12 well plates were transfected twice with BTV RNAs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) monolayers of each of the BTV segments encoding VP1, VP3, VP4, NS1, VP6 and NS2 were diluted in Opti-MEM I Reduced Serum Medium. after 25 min of incubation, the mixture was added to the cells. IFNT was produced in Pichia pastoris and purified as described previously. BFAE cells and CPT-Tert cells were treated with 1000 AVU of IFN 20 h prior infection with BTV recombinants at a MOI of 0.1 (BFAE and CPT-Tert), 0.01 or 0.001 (CPT-Tert) we used Image-Pro Plus (MediaCybernetics) to quantify in each well the percentage of the monolayer that was disrupted after BTV replication. results were expressed as the percentage of destroyed monolayer by calculating for each well the following formula: X 100. secondary antibodies were conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen, Molecular Probes) or Alexa Fluor 594 (Invitrogen, Molecular Probes) slides were mounted using a leica TCS SP2 confocal microscope. electron microscopy BSR cells were infected with BTV-1, BTV-8 or the corresponding deletion mutants at a MOI of 0.05 in 35 mm dishes. transgenic mice deficient in the type I interferon receptor were inoculated intraperitoneally with 100 PFU of either BTV-1, BTV-8, BTV-1NS4 or BTV-8NS4. survival plots were constructed using data collected from two experimental groups (n = 10) with the exception of a mock infected group that was constituted by a single group of 6 mice. simian virus 40 (SV40) T antigen and human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) cells were grown in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (IMDM), supplemented with 10% FBS. mammalian cell lines were cultured at 35 to 37\u00b0C, in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. residues in position 1 and 2 of NS4 differ for a single amino acid residue in position 6. total RNA was extracted from infected cells using Trizol (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. each BTV segment was cloned downstream of a T7 promoter. antibodies against B23 and -tubulin were obtained commercially (Sigma Aldrich) the reference strain of BTV-1 was originally isolated from a naturally infected sheep during the 2006 outbreak in northern Europe. the virus was passaged once in KC cells and once in BHK21 cells. plasmids containing genomic segments of BTV-1 or BTV-8 or resulting mutants were linearized with appropriate restriction enzymes. ssRNAs were purified sequentially by phenol/chloroform extraction. monolayers of 95% confluent BSR cells grown in 12 well plates were transfected twice with BTV RNAs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) RNA was extracted from infected cells using Trizol (Invitrogen) the ssRNA fraction was precipitated using lithium chloride. dsRNA fraction was precipitated using isopropanol in the presence of sodium acetate. cells were plated in 24-well plates and treated for 20 h with 1000 AVU/ml of IFNT or UIFN. the medium was replaced 2 h after infection and the cells maintained in the presence of either IFNT or UIFN at the original concentration. at 72 h post-infection, the cells were washed once with phosphate buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4). cells cultured in two-well glass chamber slides were transfected with appropriate plasmids or infected with various BTV strains at a MOI between 0.01 and 1.5. the fixed cells were processed as described previously and incubated with the appropriate antisera. mice were inoculated intra-cerebrally with 103 TCID50 of either BTV-1, BTV-8, BTV-1NS4 or BTV-8NS4. mice were euthanized at three weeks p.i. or earlier if showing advanced clinical signs of encephalitis. a stretch of 11 basic amino acid residues is present in the N terminal portion of the protein (residues 3 to 20) the C terminal helix (residues 34 to 75) contains a conserved leucine zipper domain, with leucine residues at positions 49, 56, 63 and 70. samples were analyzed at 48 h post-infection by western blotting. western blotting employed antisera against NS1, VP6, VP7, ORFX (NS4) and -tubulin as indicated. no expression of NS4 is detected in negative control mice mock-inoculated with cell culture media. we detected VP6 in both the cellular and the viral fraction. unlike VP7, VP6 appeared to be relatively more abundant in cell lysates compared to the viral pellets. the absence of ORFX in the viral pellet strongly suggested that this is a non-structural protein expressed by BTV. at 24 h post-infection, cells were fixed and analyzed by immunofluorescence as for expression of NS4 as indicated in panel A. NS4 does not have a canonical nuclear localization signal (NLS) but possesses a stretch of basic amino acid residues, at the amino terminus portion of the protein, that could drive nuclear localization [41]. BFAE cells infected with either pNS413\u201377-eGFP or pNS419\u201377-eGFP revealed that NS4 expression was evident as early as 2 hours post infection. NS4 expression was evident as early as 2 hours post infection, similar to that observed for other BTV structural and non-structural proteins. mutations were designed to leave the VP6 amino acid sequence unaltered. viable BTV1-NS4 and BTV8-NS4 were rescued with similar efficiency to wild-type (wt) viruses. as expected, viable BTV1-NS4 and BTV8-NS4 were rescued. western blotting of cellular extracts (lysate) of BSR cells infected at a MOI of 0.01 was collected at 72 h post-infection. cells were analyzed 36 h post-infection and blots were incubated with antisera against VP7, NS4 and -tubulin as indicated. in cells infected by BTV1-NS4 or BTV8-NS4, we found by electron microscopy all the ultrastructural features of BTV-infected cells. we then assessed the replication kinetics of the rescued viruses in a variety of mammalian and insect cell lines, including those corresponding to the natural hosts. dilution analysis and the virus titers expressed as log10 (TCID50/ml) each virus preparation was re-titrated by limiting dilution analysis to control that equal amounts of input virus was used in each experiment. NS4 confers a replication advantage to BTV-8, but not BTV-1 in mammalian cells treated with interferon BTV. wt consistently induced a more pronounced CPE than BTV8-NS4. only minor differences were observed in the CPE induced by both wt BTV-1 and BTV-1NS4. t and NS4 mutant viruses were observed when the input viruses were used at a MOI of 0.1 and 0.001 in CPT-Tert or in BFAE cells treated with UIFN and infected at a MOI of 0.1. cells were treated (solid line) or mock treated (dashed line) with 1000 AVU/ml of interferon (Tau, IFNT or Universal, UIFN) for 20 h prior and 2 h after being blots were incubated with antisera against NS1, VP7, VP6, NS4 and -tubulin. cells were treated with 1000 AVU/ml of Universal interferon (UIFN) for 20 h prior and 2 h after being infected by the recombinant viruses indicated in the panel. cytopathic protection assays and multistep growth assays clearly showed that BTV-8/1S9 replicated more efficiently than BTV-8/1S9NS4 in the presence of IFN. no major differences were observed between BTV-8/1S4 and BTV-1/8S9NS4 in cells pre-treated with IFN. newborn NIH-Swiss mice inoculated intracerebrally are also susceptible to BTV infection [47], [49]. 129sv IFNAR(/) mice with either BTV-1, BTV-8 or the corresponding NS4 mutants were killed by day 8 post-infection. a stretch of 11 basic amino acid residues is present in the N terminal portion of the protein (residues 3 to 20) in addition, there are two putative alpha helices. the VP6 protein (dark gray) is encoded by nucleotides 16 to 1002. western blots of viral pellets and cell protein extracts of BFAE cells infected by BTV-1 at a MOI of 0.05. samples were analyzed at 48 h post-infection by SDS-PAGE and western blotting employing antisera against NS1, VP6, VP7, ORFX (NS4) and -tubulin. we detected NS1 and ORFX in the cellular fraction. unlike VP7, VP6 appeared to be relatively more abundant in cell lysates compared to the viral pellets. NS4 was also expressed in vivo, as shown by immunohistochemistry of brain sections of mice inoculated intracerebrally with BTV. cells were fixed and analyzed by immunofluorescence using antibodies against NS4 and as indicated the nucleolar marker B23. at 24 h post-transfection, cells were fixed and analyzed by immunofluorescence as for expression of NS4 as indicated in panel A. pNS4-GFP and pNS47\u201377-eGFP transfected cells showed a strong nuclear localization of NS4. these data suggest that the amino terminal basic domain of NS4 may play an important role in the nuclear localization of this protein. NS4 expression was evident as early as 2 hours post infection. plasmids containing segment 9 of BTV-1 and BTV-8 were designed to leave the VP6 amino acid sequence unaltered. all the mutations introduced were designed to leave the VP6 amino acid sequence unaltered. viable BTV1-NS4 and BTV8-NS4 were rescued with similar efficiency to the respective wild-type (wt) viruses. BSR cells infected at a MOI of 0.01 were collected at 72 h post infection. western blotting of cellular extracts of BSR cells infected at a MOI of 0.01. blots were incubated with antisera against VP7, NS4 and -tubulin. in cells infected by BTV1-NS4 or BTV8-NS4 we found by electron microscopy all the ultrastructural features of BTV-infected cells. we then assessed the replication kinetics of the rescued viruses in a variety of mammalian and insect cell lines, including those corresponding to the natural hosts and vector (midges) supernatants collected at 8, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h after infection. supernatants were then titrated on BSR cells by limiting dilution analysis. each virus preparation was also re-titrated by limiting dilution analysis. absence of IFN treatment significantly reduced BTV-induced CPE. only minor differences were observed in the CPE induced by both wt BTV-1 and BTV-1NS4 in the presence of IFN. there was no discernable difference in the replication growth of BTV-1 and BTV-1NS4 after treatment with either IFNT or UIFN. similar patterns with both BTV-1 and BTV-8 wt and the NS4 mutant viruses where observed when the input viruses were used at a MOI of 0.1 and 0.001 in BFAE cells treated with UIFN. the NS4 of BTV-1 displays similar biological properties to the homologous BTV-8 protein. blots were incubated with antisera against NS1, VP7, VP6, NS4 and -tubulin as indicated. cytopathic protection assays and multistep growth assays clearly showed that BTV-8/1S9 replicated more efficiently than BTV-8/1S9NS4 in the presence of IFN. no major differences were observed between BTV-8/1S4 and BTV-1/8S9NS4. 129sv IFNAR(/) mice are susceptible to infection and disease induced by BTV inoculated by various routes [46], [48] newborn NIH-Swiss mice inoculated intracerebrally are also susceptible to BTV infection. NS4 confers a replication advantage to BTV-8 in cells pre-treated with type I IFN. the nucleolus is a dynamic sub-nuclear structure that plays crucial roles in ribosome subunit biogenesis. the retroviral Rev and Rev-like proteins shuttle between the nucleolus and cytoplasm. avian reovirus A protein localizes in viral factories in the cytoplasm of infected cells. it localizes in the nucleoli, suggesting that dsRNA binding and nucleolar targeting may be strictly linked. we cannot exclude completely that small amounts of NS4 are present in viral particles. the organization of VP6/NS4 ORFs in segment 9 of BTV mirrors that of NSP5/NSP6 in the rotavirus segment 11 [71] the rotavirus NSP6 is not essential for virus replication but unlike the BTV NS4 does not localize in the nucleus of infected cells [72] to date, limited information is available on the interplay between BTV and the host innate immune system. viruses use NSP1 protein to promote proteasome-dependent degradation of IRF proteins [75]\u2013[77] and mediate repression of NF-kB, resulting in a reduction of IFN induction [78]. the blocking of host cell protein synthesis is another likely strategy used by some RNA viruses to counteract the IFN response. more in vivo experiments will be needed in order to determine the role of NS4 in the interplay with the natural host of BTV infection. we observed no differences between wild type BTV-8 and BTV8-NS4 in experimental mouse models, although it remains possible that differences could be identified in sheep."}
