{"summary": "health care-associated infections can occur during a patient\u2019s treatment process or many surgical procedures and pose a major threat to patient safety and care. in 2015, 186 Korean cases of MERS-CoV occurred, mostly due to inappropriate infection control within the hospital [6] the incidence of health care-associated infections has been reported to occur in 5% to 10% of hospitalized patients. adherence to standard precautions includes hand hygiene, sharps safety, use of personal protection, respiratory hygiene, safe management of blood and body fluid spillages, and decontamination of equipment, waste, linen, and laundry. the standard precaution adherence rates of Korean nurses have been reported to range from 60% to 80%. study used a convenience sample of hospital nurses employed in a tertiary teaching, university-affiliated hospital in Seoul, Korea. the inclusion criteria were as follows: nurses with a minimum of one year of clinical experience in hospital settings. the CSPS was assessed using the Compliance with standard precaution Scale. the tool was carried out in a forward\u2013backward translation procedure. the translated CSPS was evaluated by ten nurse experts with more than 10 years of clinical experience. nurses\u2019 perception of patient safety management was assessed using the perception of Importance on Patient Safety Management scale (PI-PSM) each item was rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5 (1 = \u201cstrongly disagree\u201d, 2 = \u201cdisagree\u201d, 3 = \u201cneither\u201d, 4 = \u201cagree\u201d and 5 = \u201cstrongly agree\u201d). the primary investigator contacted the hospital\u2019s nurse managers and explained the aim of the study and data collection process. two research assistants were then trained to assist with both the distribution and collection of the questionnaires. participants were informed about the study\u2019s purpose and asked to provide their written consent. adherence to standard precautions was assessed using the Compliance with standard precaution Scale (CSPS) [25]. the tool was carried out in a forward\u2013backward translation procedure. a third researcher compared the two versions and selected the best translation. Cronbach\u2019s coefficient was 0.86 when the scale was developed and 0.93 in this study. permission to use the CSPS was obtained from the original author via email. the translated CSPS was evaluated by ten nurse experts with more than 10 years of clinical experience. the four attributes of the questions were rated on a 4-point scale (1 = \u201cnot relevant\u201d; 4 = \u201chighly relevant\u201d). the content validity index was 0.87, with good congruence with the original version. each item was rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5. higher scores indicated recognition of the importance of patient safety management was high. the Cronbach coefficient was 0.86 when the scale was developed. participants were female, the average age was 29.48 4.50 years, and 242 (73.6%) were single. the majority were university graduates (73.9%) and staff nurses (83.0%). the average for the nurses\u2019 total clinical experience was 6.74 4.72 years. the average score of the standard precaution adherence was 10.71 4.39. the item with the highest adherence was \u201cI put used sharp articles into sharps box\u201d (94.8%), whereas the item with the lowest adherence was \u201cI wear a gown or apron when exposed to blood, body fluids, or any patient excretions\u201d (17.9%). a nurse caring for 5 to 9 patients was more likely to adhere to standard precautions than a nurse looking after 15 or more patients (p = 0.046). a nurse caring for 5 to 9 patients was more likely to adhere to standard precautions than a nurse looking after 15 or more patients (p = 0.046). years in

53.5%. the average scores for standard precaution adherence were 12.93 points for nurses and 9.75 points for student nurses. standard precaution adherence rates were relatively high in units with fewer than 20 nurses, such as newborn nurseries, delivery rooms, and psychiatric wards. adherence to standard precautions was significantly lower among nurses who worked in settings where there were more than 15 patients per RN per shift. the average estimated patient-per-RN rate per shift in general hospitals from 1996 to 2013 was 16.3 to 21.8. adherence to standard precautions among hospital nurses was only significantly associated with adherence to standard precautions. despite no observed significant relationship between nurse-to-patient ratio and adherence to standard precautions, low adherence to standard precautions may be caused by inappropriate work conditions. study suggests that supportive, specialized training in wearing personal protective equipment has to be executed well. nurse educators should develop an integrated undergraduate curriculum linked to clinical nurse education."}
