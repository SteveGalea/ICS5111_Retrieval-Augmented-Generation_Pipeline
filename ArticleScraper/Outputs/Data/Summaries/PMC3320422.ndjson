{"summary": "the study we searched the electronic archive of the new Zealand Herald for a 3-month period beginning with WHO's first global alert (March 13\u2013June 11, 2003). the search was confined to the news section of the newspaper's web site because stories on SARS in the business and sports sections rarely provided information on health aspects. cOther signs and symptoms included loss of appetite, malaise, rigor, vomiting, sore throat, dizziness, sputum, night sweat, coryza, abdominal pain, neck pain, nausea, arthralgia. information on SARS no. (%) of articles (N = 261) of articles (N = 261) SARS transmission and control measures reported in the new Zealand Heralda. information attributable to health officials in new Zealand was compared to the information on the ministry of health's web site and its media releases (n = 19) (6). the rate of articles mentioning SARS (87 per month) was greater than that for smoking and tobacco (59 per month), cancer (43 articles), diabetes (12 articles), heart disease (10 articles), and asthma (6 articles). 26% of articles, and the terms \"pneumonia\" or \"flu\" were also commonly used. more detailed information on symptoms was rare; 3% of articles mentioned the specific temperature of 38\u00b0C. some comments reported were overly pessimistic. headlines include \"doctor dies of killer virus,\" \"nature's terrorism strangles Hong Kong\" and \"sARS deaths leap,\" \"panicking crowds flee,\" and \"creeping panic over epidemic\" this finding suggests the need for health authorities to use simple language. a range of newspapers could be studied, along with key interviews with health reporters. this particular major daily newspaper provided generally useful and accurate information to the public on SARS. this finding highlights the potential value of the media for communication about public health issues."}
