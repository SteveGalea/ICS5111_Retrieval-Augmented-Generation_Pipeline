{"summary": "rabies has been diagnosed on the Arabian Peninsula in dogs, cats, sheep, goats, foxes, dromedaries, and in a horse. the first cases were reported in 1992/1993.3. in 1992/1993 the disease entered the united arab Emirates via al-Ain. four months later it reached Abu Dhabi and Dubai where rabies killed 17 more dromedaries and one sheep. rabies viruses cluster together in a European/Middle East lineage,6 segregated into 2 distinct branches. the reference method of making a diagnosis of rabies is to demonstrate rabies virus antigen in impression smears of fresh brain by immuno fluorescence. the major pandemic of 19182 named the Spanish flu was hypothesized to have arisen as a result of spontaneous mutation within an avian H1N1 virus. in 2009 and 2014, 49 strains of H1N1 were isolated from sick human patients in the united arab Emirates. the virus can be transmitted by the dromedary (Camelus dromedarius) through nasal and eye secretions to humans. it is now confirmed that the virus can be transmitted through nasal and eye secretions to humans. thirty species of ticks, particularly the genus Hyalomma, act as reservoir and vector. humans become infected by tick bites or through close contact with infected animals and humans. another viral hemorrhagic disease has emerged in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the mid 1990\u2019s. the west Nile virus (WNV) was first isolated in the west Nile district of Uganda in 1937 from a woman with mild febrile illness. since then, WNV outbreaks have been reported all over the world. the genus Flavivirus, to which WNV belongs, comprises over 70 viruses. human brucellosis remains one of the most common zoonotic diseases worldwide with more than 500,000 new cases annually. in humans, the disease referred to as undulant fever or Malta fever is a very serious public health problem. in 2003 in. Saudi Arabia alone 4534 human brucellosis cases were reported. in 2003 in. Saudi Arabia alone 4534 human brucellosis cases were reported. glanders are associated with extensive contact with equids. the disease was recently demonstrated for the first time in the Bahrain outbreak. dromedaries became infected by close contact with positive horses. yersinia pestis was cultured from the bone marrow of the sick camel and from jirds (Meriones lybycus), a small rodent as well as fleas (Xenopsylla cheopis) captured in the camel coral. the patients reported that several of their camels had died, most probably from plague. leishmania is widely distributed in arid and savannah rodents. the viscerotropic strains of leishmania infantum causes the zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis (ZVL) the disease is endemic on the Arabian Peninsula. hydatid cysts have been found in different organs of dromedaries and small ruminants. offals containing the cysts and abandoned carcasses may infect canines. zoonotic diseases have been introduced from africa and Asia into the Arabian Peninsula, but also other diseases such as foot-and-mouth with severe consequences for the livestock industry. there is an urgent need for interdisciplinary collaboration between health, agricultural, and environmental ministries of all countries of the Arabian Peninsula."}
