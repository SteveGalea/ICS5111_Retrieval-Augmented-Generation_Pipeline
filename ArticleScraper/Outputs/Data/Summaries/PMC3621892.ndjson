{"summary": "a total of 937,990 high quality reads (308.63 Mb) with an average read length of 329 bp were generated. total RNA was isolated from leaves with sodium nitroprusside (SNP), salicylic acid (SA) or methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment, stems, and flowers. the genus Lycoris is an important group of Amaryllidaceae. it is composed of approximately 20 species of flowering plants native to the moist warm temperate woodlands of eastern and southern Asia. most of the Lycoris species are commonly cultivated in china, Korea, Japan and Vietnam as bulbous plants. lycorine causes a rapid turnover of protein levels of myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) which may play an important survival role in a variety of tumor cells including leukemia were reported [10] lycorine is an active component in the alkaloid portion and a good candidate for the development of new antiviral medicine in the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome. a large number of plants [26], [34], [40]\u2013[42] have been performed for transcriptome analyses by Roche 454 pyrosequencing. this study was to characterize the transcriptome of L. aurea in Lycoris species using high-throughput Roche 454 pyrosequencing. studies have reported that L. aurea is a good material for extraction of galantamine and other alkaloids [55], [57]. however, little research has been performed to address the Amaryllidaceae alkaloids biosynthesis-related genes. to date, there are only less than 9,000 ESTs available for Lycoris. cDNA Synthesis and Normalization In order to achieve L. aurea transcriptome, total RNA was extracted from a variety of adult organs and tissues, including the leaves, stem, and flowers. it has been reported that the content of galanthamine in some plants would have been affected after treating with sodium nitroprusside (SNP), salicylic acid (SA) or meJA. the reads produced by the Roche 454 GS FLX were used for clustering and assembly. a total of 937,990 high-quality transcriptomic reads with a total size of 308,633,593 bp were obtained. length of these reads ranged between 150 and 854 bases with an average length of 329 bp per read. all transcriptomic reads 937,990 total number of bases 308,633,593 bp average read length 329 bp No. of contigs 24,604 No. of singletons 116,507 GC Content and Alternative Splicing The content of GC was 40.42% and 39.58% in contigs and singletons, respectively, giving rise to an overall GC content of 40.03%. a total of 36,188 unigenes could be assigned to one or more ontologies based on their similarity to sequences with previously known functions. a total of 36,188 unigenes could be assigned to one or more ontologies based on their similarity to previously known functions. in total, 196, 451 GO terms were retrieved, 22.38%, 40.65% and 36.97% in the molecular function, in the cellular component and in the biological process category. GO annotations for the unigenes showed fairly consistent sampling of functional classes. 2,142 unique sequences had a COG functional classification. 'translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis' represented the most common category (426, 19.89%) followed by \u2018posttranslational modification, protein turnover, chaperones\u2019 (362, 16.90%) and \u2018General function prediction only\u2019 (254, 11.86%) the most represented subcategories were phenylpropanoid biosynthesis (226), terpenoid backbone biosynthesis (161), tropane, piperidine and pyridine alkaloid biosynthesis (112), carotenoid biosynthesis (99), limonene and pinene degradation (96), flavonoid biosynthesis (84), stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid and gingerol biosynthesis (76), and chloroalkane and chloro at present, over 100 alkaloids have been isolated from different Amaryllidaceae plants. these alkaloids are classified into 9 skeleton types, for which the representative alkaloids are: norbelladine, lycorine, homolycorine, crinine, haemanthamine, arciclasine, tazettine, montanine and galanthamine. plant cytochromes P450 (P450s) catalyze monooxygenation/hydroxylation reactions in primary and secondary metabolism. they participate in a variety of biochemical pathways to produce primary and secondary metabolites. phenylpropanoids, alkaloids, terpenoids, lipids, cyanogenic glycosides, and glucosinolates, as well as plant hormones. tyrosine decarboxylase (TYDC), OMT, P450s, N-Methyltransferase (NMT) and other potential candidates were identified. 91 unique sequences were identified as PAL1, PAL2, and PAL3 with similarities ranging from 62%100%, respectively. di-nucleotide repeats (19.83%), tetranucleotides (6.98%), pentanucleotides (2.77%) and hexanucleotides (2.05%) were the three predominant types among the di-nucleotide repeats motifs. in the 20 types of tri-nucleotide repeats, CTT (19.39%) was the most common motif, followed by AAG (13.47%), G a total of 937,990 high-quality transcriptomic reads were obtained. a large number of SNPs and SSRs were predicted and can be used for subsequent marker development, genetic linkage and QTL analysis. quality of the RNA was found to be suitable for cDNA synthesis. equal quantities of RNA from different samples were mixed together. normalization of the cDNA greatly reduces the frequency of abundant transcripts, and increases the rate recovery of unique transcripts. the number of ESTs that are available from Lycoris is less than 9,000. so far, the number of ESTs that are available from Lycoris is less than 9,000. this is the first comprehensive study of the transcriptome of L. aurea. 66,197 (46.91%) L. aurea unigenes including 18,397 contigs and 47,800 singletons were significantly matched to known genes in the public databases. previous studies have shown that approximately 87% of Arabidopsis 454-derived ESTs could be aligned to predicted genes [43]. GO Assignments GO provides a structured and controlled vocabulary for describing gene products in three categories: molecular function, biological process and cellular component [72] a total of 36,188 unigenes could be assigned to one or more ontologies based on their similarity to sequences with previously known functions. the assigned sequences were divided into 58 functional terms. \u2018metabolic processes\u2019 (27.88%) and \u2018cellular process\u2019 (27.29%) were among the most highly represented groups under biological functions category. this might be indicating the analyzed tissues were undergoing rapid growth and extensive metabolic activities. genes encoding these functions may be more conserved across different species and are thus easier to annotate in the database. ortholog assignment and mapping of contigs and singletons to biological pathways were performed using KEGG automatic annotation server (KAAS) EC numbers for 3,222 contigs and singletons were mapped onto a total of 295 predicted metabolic pathways, representing compound biosynthesis, degradation, utilization and metabolism. KEGG pathway analysis and COG analysis are helpful for predicting potential genes and their functions at a whole transcriptome level. the predicted metabolic pathways, together with the COG analysis, are useful for further investigations of gene function in future studies. the presence of the enzyme phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) has been demonstrated in Amaryllidaceae plants. the elimination of ammonia mediated by this enzyme is known to occur in an antiperiplanar manner to give trans-cinnamic acid, with loss of the -pro-S hydrogen. CYP719 families, known to catalyze reactions (such as C-O and C-C phenol-coupling reaction) atypical for P450s, function in benzylisoquinoline alkaloids biosynthesis [85]\u2013[88]. many genes might be involved in Amaryllidaceae alkaloids synthesis, including phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), tyrosine decarboxylase (OMT in total, 9,740 SSRs were obtained from the transcriptomic dataset. of these, the most frequent repeat motifs were tri-nucleotides, followed by di-nucleotides, tetranucleotides, pentanucleotides and hexanucleotides. a total of 55,800 SNPs were identified from alignments of multiple sequences used for contig assembly. a total of 5,160 indels were putative indels (In), 32,440 were putative transitions (Ts) and 18,220 were putative transversions (Tv) samples were collected from a variety of adult organs and tissues. the stem and flowers collected for the RNA extraction were at their bud, blooming, and wilting stages respectively. the samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u201380\u00b0C until use. the quality control of a double DNA library was performed using high-sensitivity chip (Agilent Technologies) the concentration and proper ligation of the adapters were examined by using TBS 380 Fluorometer. the initial assembly comprised 937,990 reads. potential SNPs were extracted using VarScan (http://varscan.sourceforge.net) with the default parameter only when both alleles were detected. plants were collected from a variety of adult organs and tissues, including the stem, flowers, and leaves. od were treated with 500 M sodium nitroprusside (SNP), 250 M salicylic acid (SA), or 100 M methyl jasmonate (MeJA) for 1, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h. all of the samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u201380\u00b0C until use. cDNA library was constructed using the CreatorTM SMARTTM cDNA library construction kit. sequencing reads were assembled using the newbler software package. all of the ESTs from the Roche 454 were used to run the final assembly of L. aurea. potential SNPs were extracted using VarScan (http://varscan.sourceforge.net) with the default parameter only when both alleles were detected from 454 reads."}
