{"summary": "the effective virucidal concentration (EC) of CPC was determined using a hemagglutination assay and tissue culture infective dose assay. the effect of CPC on viral envelope morphology and ultrastructure was evaluated using the PR8 murine influenza model. annual influenza epidemics in the united states result in nearly 600,000 life-years lost, 3.1 million days of hospitalization, and 31.4 million outpatient visits. current prevention strategies for influenza depend on the use of anti-influenza medications and vaccines. current coverage estimates are well below the Healthy People 2020 goal of 70%. CPC and other quaternary ammonium compounds are commonly employed in the prevention of bacterial and fungal infections within healthcare settings. however, there is little evidence demonstrating their effectiveness against the prototypical respiratory influenza virus. diluted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) were added to media and incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes. cells were washed 3 times in DMEM to remove residual CPC. cells were returned to 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2. the concentration of chicken RBCs was standardized using a hemocytometer. a concentration of 50 g/mL was employed to ensure adequate visualization of CPC activity on TEM analysis while still remaining below CC50 toxicity levels. wildtype mice were infected intranasally (LD50, 8.0 x 103 pfu/mouse) with the mouse-adapted influenza strain A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 H1N1 (PR8, ATCC) mice were treated with ARMS-1 (5 L, applied orally) for 2 hours followed by secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody for 2 hours. survival and body weight measurements were used to evaluate the effect of ARMS-1. all experiments were approved by case Western Reserve university institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC) protocol #2011-0200. the therapeutic index (CC50/EC50) of CPC ranges between 7.7 and 19.2 (Table 1). the therapeutic index (CC50/EC50) of CPC ranges between 7.7 and 19.2 (Table 1). tination data showed that CPC conferred a 2 log reduction in influenza virus by TCID50 (EC2log) at 20 g/mL (EC2log) for all influenza strains tested. influenza B appeared more susceptible to CPC than influenza A (4 g/mL vs 20 g/mL respectively) Isolate 40 is a clinical strain of influenza A (H1N1pdm09) virus propagated from a patient sample. no difference in CPC susceptibility was seen between strains. ed envelope or cavitation (arrows) of viral units indicates membrane permeabilization. we quantified the number of intact and disrupted viruses after treatment. we found that 86% (172/200) of the viruses were disrupted while in untreated samples only 4.5% (9/200) were disrupted. Influenza A (H1N1, H3N2) and Influenza B strains were continuously grown in 3 sub-inhibitory concentrations of CPC for 10 passages. no development of resistance to CPC was seen in any strain of influenza at any tested concentration of CPC. clinical efficacy met statistical significance. but this study was not powered to address efficacy against specific pathogens. ARMS-1 containing 0.1% CPC w/v reduced influenza-associated pathogenicity in vivo. the ARMS-I and oseltamivir groups were treated 15 minutes before the challenge and then twice a day for 5 consecutive days. animals treated 4 hpi with ARMS-I did not have significant weight loss in contrast to animals treated 24 hpi. survival analysis showed that ARMS-I treatment 24 hpi significantly increased survival compared to untreated mice. this was well below the 50% cytotoxic concentration of CPC (CC50) of 96 g/mL (Figure 1). hemagglutination assay titer performed with n = 6 experimental replicates. CC50 was determined to be 96g/mL by neutral red assay Figure 1. the cell viability was determined using the neutral red assay and the absorbance was measured at 450 nm, n = 4 experimental replicates. time-kill curves of influenza exposed to EC50 concentrations of CPC at increasing exposure times are shown. Fifty percent of infectious virus was inactivated in the first 5 minutes of exposure for all isolates except for FluB. 86% (172/200) of the viruses were disrupted or lacked the envelope in CPC-treated samples. 4.5% (9/200) of untreated virus preparations displayed disrupted or non-enveloped morphologies. untreated influenza virus treated with 50 g/mL CPC for 5 minutes. s above 7.5 g/mL produced significant elevations in nucleoprotein release compared to control, n = 8 experimental replicates, shown as mean SD. exposure to CPC does not induce the development of resistance in influenza virus. influenza virus exposed to sub-inhibitory concentrations of CPC. influenza B susceptibility to CPC continued to be comparable to that of influenza A. the clinical formulation of CPC named \u201cARMS-1\u201d is used prophylactically for upper respiratory infections. this study was not powered to address efficacy against specific pathogens. survival analysis showed that ARMS-I-treated mice showed increased survival compared to untreated mice. there was no significant difference in survival between the ARMS-I-treated vs oseltamivir-treated groups. asterisk (*) indicates P 0.05 between indicated ARMS-1 and either vehicle or no treatment group in prophylactic (A, B) and therapeutic (C, D) studies. one of 2 similar experiments is shown CPC exhibits direct virucidal activity against influenza viruses. clinical Isolate 40 6 g/mL (6 - 6 g/mL)* 16 Oseltamivir Resistant Influenza A 8 g/mL (6 - 6 g/mL)* 12 EC50 was calculated by hemagglutination assay titer performed with n = 6 experimental replicates. data represent mean SD. the EC50 for resistant influenza A and B viruses were both 8 g/mL. the EC50 for susceptible isolates ranged between 5 and 12.5 g/mL. this suggests that CPC is equally effective against both susceptible and resistant viral strains. sure of influenza virus to CPC for more than 5 minutes caused 50% decrease in viability in all viral strains tested except H3N2. continued exposure to CPC for 90 minutes led to 90% decrease in influenza titer. TEM analyses showed that while the viral envelope of untreated influenza viruses was intact, exposure to CPC led to disruption of the envelope and gross distortion of viral ultrastructure. exposure of virus to increasing concentrations of CPC resulted in significantly increased levels of viral nucleoprotein into the media supernatant. the level of released nucleoprotein reached a plateau at CPC concentrations above 10 g/mL. exposure to CPC concentrations above 7.5 g/mL produced significant elevations in nucleoprotein release compared to control. no development of resistance to CPC was seen in any strain of influenza at any tested concentration of CPC, n = 3 experimental replicates, shown as mean SD. no increase in EC50 was noted at any concentration for either H1N1 or H3N2. BS-treated mice were significantly reduced at 3, 4, 5, and 6 days post infection (dpi) the increase in relative body weight between ARMS-I-treated and untreated mice ranged between 14% on day 3 and 24.8% on day 6 post-infection. there was no significant difference in survival between the ARMS-I-treated and untreated mice. ARMS-I treatment 24 hpi significantly increased survival compared to untreated mice. however, this difference was not statistically signifi-cant (P = 0.08, Figure 6D) these in vivo studies provide physiological evidence that CPC-based treatments may be efficacious in the prevention and treatment of influenza-associated morbidity and mortality. it is assumed that CPC has direct action against lipid bilayer membranes, particularly the cytoplasmic membrane, leading to leakage of cytoplasmic contents. this mechanism allows for a broad but varied spectrum of activity among different types of microorganisms. there have been no studies published to date on the effectiveness of CPC against respiratory viral pathogens such as influenza. cytotoxicity testing of CPC in human-derived cells, such as A549 cells, may add to our understanding of potential toxicity. we expect that longer exposure may also portend increased toxicity. extensive safety studies have already been conducted with CPC. potential activity of CPC against non-enveloped pathogens remains unclear. but further evaluation of effectiveness against viral pathogens other than influenza has potential clinical value. overuse of NAIs has quickly led to the spread of neuraminidase resistance. mice treated with ARMS-1 either before or following infectious challenge showed significantly increased survival compared to vehicle control mice. no toxicity was detected in the mice treated with ARMS-1 in our experimental mouse model. this protection was most prominent when ARMS-1 was given 15 minutes before or 4 hours after infection.
