{"summary": "the pigs are slaughtered at commercial abattoirs other commercial units have varying levels of biosecurity, feed commercial pig rations and the pigs are slaughtered at commercial abattoirs. the pigs are slaughtered informally for special events and contribute to food security for those with a low socio-economic status. south africa has a very-good-to-excellent border-control system but shares lengthy borders with six contiguous countries. exotic diseases (serotype O foot and mouth disease), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) and classical swine fever (CSF) have entered South Africa. between 1993 and 2009, the south African pig industry coordinated 11 rounds of serological and sometimes virological testing for pig diseases. the results were validated in international reference laboratories to validate the results. the provincial veterinary services are the first line of defence against disease incursions. a colour-coded risk-estimate table was provided for the pig veterinarians to comment on their perception of the likelihood of occurrence and level of risk posed by 11 selected pig diseases. the provinces operate a six-Directorate system including the Animal Health, Laboratory Services & Quality Assurance, Veterinary Public Health, Export Control, Veterinary Clinical Services and Epidemiology. a set of questions were adapted from the work of Geering and Lubroth (2002). the questions included: what is the current geographic distribution and incidence of the disease nationally, regionally and internationally. the inclusion criteria for participants were as follows: (1) being a state veterinarian or a pig consultant, (2) having provision of pig-related veterinary services within the last 3 years. the criteria were: (1) being part of the study-group membership, (2) specialisation in other species or (3) having other interests that could potentially bias the study. d for estimating the risks of GMOs was provided for the pig veterinarians to comment on their perception of the likelihood of occurrence and level of risk posed by 11 selected pig diseases (ASF, FMD, Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV), CSF, PRRS, brucellosis, swine influenza (SI), porcine respiratory coronavirus (PCRV), transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE), swine vesi questionnaire was developed and tested amongst six pig veterinarians to assess ease of understanding of the question and validity of the testing instrument. participants were as follows: (1) being a state veterinarian or a pig consultant, (2) having had provision of pig-related veterinary services within the last 3 years. a total of 65 questionnaires were administered and 57 (87.69%) were returned. a total of 45 responses (69.23%) were entered into an excel data sheet. a descriptive analysis and a rotated factor loading analysis (RFLA) were conducted on the data using the online WESSA statistical software. the rapidity of sample transportation to the national testing laboratory and the flow of information between the provincial and national veterinary authorities were perceived to be the least difficult operations to perform. a total of 76.19% perceived that the routine inspection of pork and other pig products was performed at all abattoirs, but only 21.00% confirmed that enough funds were made available annually. logistic problems and inadequate manpower were perceived to be significant deficiencies that needed immediate attention within the provinces. farmers 1 2 3 4 5 3.77 0.91 1 Livestock disease information flow between pig farmers 1 2 3

important variable that influences the risk of pig diseases. failure of these services will produce a negative effect on policy supporting livestock services and drive pig disease intensification in South Africa. undetected cases may be reintroduced to other farms, sold at auctions or spread locally through home slaughter or be slaughtered at the local abattoir. detecting at this level may stop further spread of the disease; however, in case of non-detection, the industry may suffer widespread outbreaks following this event. veterinary drugs were perceived to be easily accessible at provincial level (51.16%) but black-market drugs and vaccines were perceived to be somewhat of a problem. supporting infrastructures were perceived to be available within the provinces (47.50%); however, movement control of pigs within certain provinces was perceived to be deficient. Rank 12 is the least difficult activity, while Rank 1 is the most difficult activity, based on the state veterinarians\u2019 perception ranking. significant difference exists between the 10 most difficult pig-related veterinary services provided by the veterinary officers. veterinary drugs easily accessible within the province 43 22 51.16 36.39, 65.78 21 48.84 34.22, 63.61 Black-maketeering is a problem for veterinary drugs within the province 41 17 34.15 20.93, 49.54 27 65.85 50.46, 79.07 Supporting infrastructure within the province for veterinary services is available 40 19 47.50 32.47. latent variables for risk of pig diseases Factors that were identified as influencing the risk of pig diseases in south africa included: transport, access, livestock policy/Animal Diseases Act (Act 35 of 1984) implementation and resources/budget allocations. variables factor 1 Factor 2 Factor 3 Factor 4 Province collects reports of unusual death patterns from farmers. 0.021 0.725 0.046 Provincial Veterinary Department has vet officers/animal health assistants in all the pig auction sites and markets. provincial Veterinary Department encounters logistic problem associated with veterinary services within the province. failure of any one of the factors above will tend to lead to a failure of the correlated factors. the second factor is access related, which is primarily a measure of gaining rapid access to all areas under veterinary jurisdiction. the second factor is access related, which is primarily a measure of gaining rapid access to all areas under veterinary jurisdiction. Aujeszky\u2019s disease was the least significant disease, with a score of 7.71/25 each. other diseases of importance for South Africa, based on perceived risk of introduction, include: PRRS, Brucella suis, swine influenza, transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) and porcine respiratory coronavirus. lack of complete reporting within the country and also in the neighbouring countries will continue to pose a risk of disease introduction and spread to South Africa. veterinary services should strengthen interdependence amongst the provinces and the national services, including an enabling law that mandates a province with infection to inform other contiguous provinces. veterinary services should strengthen interdependence amongst the provinces and the national services, including an enabling law that mandates a province with infection to inform other contiguous provinces. swine fever and FMD remain significant threats to the south africa pig population. changes in environmental ecology and movement of vectors may be expanding the reach of these infectious agents. a comprehensive animal healthcare plan can be made for south africa. risk profiling of pig diseases and those of other animals will need to be periodically conducted and evaluated. there are needs for location-specific and targeted training of provincial and national veterinary officers and their staff, as well as production-related and biosecurity-type training for farmers. private veterinary services must be encouraged to be involved in clinical veterinary healthcare delivery systems, especially at the smallholder and rural levels. the presence and spread of transboundary diseases of animals in a country is a constant threat to pig and other animal populations in contiguous countries. it is well established that the presence and spread of transboundary diseases of animals in a country is a constant threat to pig and other animal populations in contiguous countries. it is important to fully integrate emerging, small-scale and middle-scale farmers into the industry, give them adequate livestock education, encourage the importance of farm-level biosecurity and encourage disease reporting among themselves. a contingency document will need to be put in place at national level and adapted at provincial level. F.O.F. carried out the statistical analysis. all authors participated in the drafting, reading and review of the final manuscript."}
