{"summary": "human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) spreads fast and the HIV/AIDS pandemic still stands as a serious public health problem worldwide. current situation clearly indicates the necessity of developing new anti-HIV agents which can be used for prevention of HIV/AIDS dissemination. natural antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are widely expressed and rapidly induced on epithelial surfaces to repel invasion from diverse infectious agents including bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites. most AMPs maintain certain common features such as being small (10\u201350 amino acids) Scorpion venom is a cocktail of peptides and proteins with diverse bioactivities. five scorpion venom peptides and their derivatives were screened for their anti-HIV-1 activities. three of them (mocroporin-M1, BmKn2 and Kn2-7) showed potent anti-HIV-1 activity, in which Kn2-7 showed the highest level of anti-HIV-1 activity. we speculated that Kn2-7 might be a potential lead peptide. information of mucroporin, mucroporin-M1 and mucroporin-S1 were described by our previous study [38]. the charge, first and predict secondary structure of scorpion venom peptides. croporin-M1, BmKn2 and Kn2-7 could significantly decrease infectivity of an HIV-1 clade B b12-resistant pseudotyped virus CAAN5342. peptide Kn2-7 showed the highest level of anti-HIV-1 activity. this gave us a hint that peptide Kn2-7 is the most potential for developing anti-HIV agent. activity of Kn2-7 against HIV-1 PV was dependent on concentration. inhibition of 40.1% was achieved at a concentration of 2 g/ml. up to 98.7% inhibition could be achieved when concentration rose to 16 g/ml. inhibition could be up to 42.3% when Kn2-7 was incubated with HIV-1 PV for only 3 min. the time needed for Kn2-7 to act on HIV-1 PV was very short and the activity peaked at the time point of 60 min. the interaction time and order among Kn2-7, HIV-1 PV and TZM-b1 cells were varied by four different ways described in Materials and Methods. mucroporin-S1 were prepared in the same manner and set as mock group. cells were infected with mixture of HIV-1 PV and 10 g/ml peptides. they were pre-incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. the inhibitory effects of different groups were determined in TZM-bl detection system. sensors were associated with 10 g/ml and 40 g/ml of Kn2-7 or mucroporin-S1 for 900 s. the negative control of mucroporin-S1 showed no inhibitory effect. the negative control of mucroporin-S1 showed no inhibitory effect. incubated with different strains of HIV-1 PV (200 TCID50) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. then added to TZM-bl cells. negative control peptide, mucroporin-S1, did not show any inhibitory effect. luciferase activities of infected TZM-bl cells were measured after 48 h incubation. similar trends of inhibitory effect were observed. but 15 g/ml of Kn2-7 inhibited virus replication completely. both 10 and 15 g/ml of Kn2-7 showed completed suppression by p24 assay. samples were measured for p24 protein by ELSIA. the scorpion venom peptide derivative Kn2-7 has antiviral effect against replication-competent HIV-1 virus with broad-spectrum. the five peptides were synthesized on an abimed AMS 422 synthesizer. the purities of all five peptides showed reliable quality of more than 95%. the molecule weights measured by mass spectrometry were completely matched with the calculated molecule weights of these peptides. mucroporin-S1 was chosen as a negative control for the further study. the antiviral effect of the peptides against HIV-1 PV was performed by TZM-bl detection systems. inhibition could be up to 42.3% when Kn2-7 was incubated with HIV-1 PV for only 3 min. inhibition could be up to 42.3% when Kn2-7 was incubated with HIV-1 PV for only 3 min. TZM-bl cells were treated with several concentrations of Kn2-7 peptide for 24 hours. viability of TZM-bl cells was measured using the MTS assay. CC50 of Kn2-7 on TZM-bl cells was 38.46 g/ml, which is 13.93 times over the EC50 value. in Fig. 3, Kn2-7 incubating with HIV-1 PV for 1 h before inoculating to TZM-b1 cells (peptide/virus pre-incubation group) showed prominent inhibitory effect. neither the peptide pretreated group, in which TZM-bl cells were infected with HIV-1 PV first and then treated with Kn2-7 showed any antiviral effect. we assumed that the anti-HIV activity of Kn2-7 attributed to its interaction with HIV-1 viral particle directly. a binding assay based on biolayer interferometry was performed to study the interaction between HIV-1 PV and HIV-1 PV. panel of HIV-1 subtype B isolates were measured using TZM-bl detection system. mucroporin-S1 was used as the negative control. negative control of mucroporin-S1 show no inhibitory effect. serial dilutions of Kn2-7 or mucroporin-S1 were incubated with 20 l X4-tropic proviral DNA (pKS242) derived HIV-1 virus (15 ng p24) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. supernatant and cell samples were collected at day 7, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17. infectivity was further detected by TZM-bl detection system. g/ml of Kn2-7 showed completed suppression by p24 assay. results further demonstrated that the Kn2-7 can inhibit HIV infectivity. cytotoxicity of peptides on CEM174 cells was measured from 5 g/ml to 100 g/ml. the quest for effective anti-HIV-1 microbicides is essential for countering the spread of the diseases worldwide when there is no effective prophylactic HIV vaccine available at present. an effective microbicide against HIV should be efficient with anti-HIV-1 activity, safe with low cytotoxicity to host cells and broad-spectrum against both R5-tropic and X4-tropic HIV-1 [6],[43],[44]. Kn2-7 was modified from BmKn2 by enhancing the net positive charge of the hydrophilic side and the amphiphilic helix through amino acid replacing (G3K, A4R, and S10R) we found Kn2-7 had higher anti-HIV-1 activity than BmKn2 but with similar CC50 to cells and even decreased toxicity response by the mouse skin model test. Kn2-7 was proven to be active to both cell-free and cell-associated replication-competent HIV-1 exhibited by its suppressing capability on infected TZM-bl cells. 15 g/ml of Kn2-7 almost completely inhibited viral replication-competent HIV-1. we assumed that Kn2-7 may implement the inhibition of HIV-1 with the similar mechanism. a rationally designed peptide, Kn2-7, shows potent antiviral activities against 13 strains of HIV-1 subtype B strains by direct interaction with virus regardless of their tropism with low cytotoxicity. the data presented here suggest that Kn2-7 is a potential microbicide candidate against HIV-1 and even become a powerful anti-HIV-1 drug component when it is conjugated with HIV-1 specific antibodies. mucroporin-M1 is an 11-amino peptide by removing 6 N-terminal amino acids from mucroporin as a control in this study. all peptides were purified on a C18 column (Elite HPLC, China) using a linear gradient and peaks were detected by the absorbance at 215 nm.
