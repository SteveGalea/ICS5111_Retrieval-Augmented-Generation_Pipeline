{"summary": "influenza is a vaccine-preventable acute respiratory viral infection that causes epidemics annually around the globe. a regional influenza stakeholder network (MENA-ISN) comprised of experts assessed the status of influenza prevention and control using a structured survey. virological data collected from member states through GISRS enable the WHO to make recommendations for vaccine composition annually. several countries in various regions of the world have not established influenza surveillance systems. the collected data explored the existence of surveillance systems, vaccine recommendations, and influenza programs in each country. one MOH official was available to confirm the data. the data was collected using a survey questionnaire to obtain information in four categories from each participating country. seven out of 10 countries had a WHO-accredited laboratory designated as a national influenza center. Libya and KSA reported having only regional laboratories that had not yet been accredited by the WHO. in eight out of 10 countries, a reimbursement policy existed for vaccine-recommended groups. in six out of 10 countries, pharmacies were the retailers. in six out of 10 countries, pharmacies were the retailers. all countries with defined risk groups except Iran and Turkey had set a target rate for vaccination at varying levels depending on the risk group. all countries with defined risk groups except Iran and Turkey had set a target rate for vaccination at varying levels. the target rate ranged from 10.0% to 75.0%, 20.0% to 90.0%, 100%, 90.0 to100%, 5.0% to 90.0% respectively. for countries like Turkey and Oman, published data were available on drivers and barriers. rs not always recommending strongly Libya High awareness No barriers Morocco Health care workers not convinced No public awareness campaign at the national level Disease severity is under-recognized Negative media coverage about the vaccine Fear of side effects Distrust in vaccine effectiveness UAE Knowledge of disease and its severity Lack of effectiveness The negative effect of media WHO: world health organization. influenza disease burden data concerning only the incidence of influenza confirmed severe acute respiratory illness cases for Iran, Egypt, and Tunisia. in the same issue of the EMHJ, influenza outbreak characterization from other regional countries such as Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, and Yemen were also published. despite the recommendations and reimbursement schemes, vaccination coverage remains low (3%) in the surveyed countries. the WHO launched global action plan for influenza Vaccines in 2006. a recently-launched platform, eastern mediterranean flu for sharing epidemiological and virological data on influenza in the WHO eastern Mediterranean region may help in better dissemination of surveillance data in the region. survey provides information on areas that need to be improved to document disease burden, increase influenza awareness, and vaccination coverage rates."}
