Interestingly, there is experimental evidence that the rate of cytosine deamination is faster (>100 times) in the single stranded than in nucleotides and tetra-nucleotides show strong biases (lzl > 3.29) in 31 RNA viruses. for di-nucleotides, all 16 (100%) show strong biases in part of or all 31 RNA viruses. tetra-nucleotide bias Inspection of the tetra-nucleotide usage pattern for RNA viruses

sequence was included because these regions in RNA viruses are submitted to a strong selective pressure to ensure successful replication of their own RNA in the host cell. the SARS-CoV is found to be at the basal position of other CoronaVirus types and remains closest to the Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus (TGV) and Feline CoronaVirus (FCoV) both distance trees suggested that the Bovine CoronaVirus (BCoV) and the Mouse Hepatitis Virus (MHV) should be grouped together whereas the Human CoronaVirus 229E (HCoV) is the closest to the Porcine epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PD the negative strand ssRNA viruses stemmed clearly from the positive strand ssRNA viruses. this is most obvious when the axes of projection were the 1st and 3rd eigen-vectors. this indicated that both types of viruses have a complex component of tetra-nucleotide usage patterns. for the top figure, the order for 'o' is [15,17,12,16,8,14,9,11,13,4,7,3,10,6,2,2,5,1]* (left to right), whereas 'x' is [24,27,25,28,26,18,23,20,19,21]* (left to right) for the middle figure, the order for 'o' is [15,17,12,16,8,14,9,11,13 'o' represents positive strand ssRNA virus, 'x' represents negative strand ssRNA virus. for the top figure, the order for 'o' is [3,7,1,4,2,5,6,17,13,20,10,16,9,8,11,15,12,14,18,19]* (left to right), whereas 'x' is [26,22,30,23,24,28,31,27,25,29,21]* tetra-nucleotide usage patterns (entire genome) for each virus on the 1st, 2nd and 3rd eigen-vector axes showed a different outcome when V was derived from the entire genome. it is particularly interesting that all viruses in the upper left corner corresponded to the viruses originating from the CoronaVirus family. the highest base count is 28.4% G in the Yellow Fever Virus (YFV), 38.9% A in the Respiratory Syncytial

a remarkable deviation from the expected frequencies occurs for the di-nucleotide pairs CpG and UpA (suppression or under-representation, z -50) and di-nucleotides pairs CpA and UpG (enhancement or over-representation, z > 40) these di-nucleotide biases, together with mono-nucleotide bias [13], have a direct impact on the codon usage of -104.39 566 1235 -121-14 486 976 -109.69 487 979 -95.94 684

di-nucleotide bias as defined in equation 1. the last column is the average z value across 31 RNA viruses. the deficiency in di-nucleotide CpG is often due to the fact that they are the targets for methyltransferase activity that leads to cytosine deamination. it is however unlikely that the mechanism of deamination that alters the genetic contents at the DNA level would affect the viral RNA content of most RNA viruses without a DNA stage. upA dinucleotide is chemically the most unstable among the 16 dinucleotides. this lability would create a selection pressure against di-nucleotide UpA in RNA viruses. all di-nucleotides show some kind of bias in their usage pattern across 31 different viruses. 19.5 PRV 93.8 15.6 SFV 93.8 16.0 FCoV 75.0 11.7 EV1 87.5 14.5 TBV 75.0 11.7 AEV 93.8 11.7

'x' is [26,22,30,23,24,28,27,25,29,21]*. 'o' represents positive strand ssRNA virus; 'x' represents negative strand ssRNA virus) the order for 'o' is [3,7,1,4,2,5,6,17,13,20,10,16,9,8,11,15,12,14,18,19]*. 'x' is [26,22,30,23,24,28,31,27,25,29,21]*. all viruses belong to a specific family were clustered together closely. vector corresponded to the tetra-nucleotide usage pattern for positive strand ssRNA viruses. it is important to realize what factor analysis will provide and how this analysis is different from the previous method of relationship tree generation using correlation coefficient. each eigen-vector represents the embedded component of RNA word usage patterns communalised by a group of viruses presumably under the same selection pressures. family of positive strand ssRNA viruses and 11 species from the family of negative strand ssRNA viruses are included in a common study. the coverage included the viruses that are known to cause diseases to their corresponding hosts. the acronym for each virus is shown in the table and is mentioned throughout this study. positions 6\u20139 are omitted because they overlap with 'GAGA' position 4\u20137 and 13\u201316. position 3\u20136 would also be registered as position 4\u20136 already recorded when counting tetra-nucleotide 'GAGA' ucleotides must show a prominent bias (over/under-representation) that is unique for a family of viruses. tetra-nucleotides provide 256 vector components (additional file 2). the bias in word usage is influenced by the bias of word with sizes less than n. z value is a measure of the bias of a word, with values close to zero meaning no bias, negative values meaning under-representation and positive values meaning over-representation of the word w in the RNA text. w is a word of size m; N(w) is observed count in actual viral RNA; E(w) and Var(w) are expected count and variance for w derived from the 100 artificial chromosomes. the distance between the tetra-nucleotide usage patterns of virus i and virus j is defined as follows: Distance Dij = 1 - rij; (3) where Dij is the distance between the tetra-nucleotide usage patterns of virus i and virus j; rij is the correlation coefficient between the tetra-nucleotide usage patterns of virus i. each eigen-vector represents the embedded RNA word usage patterns communalised by a group of viruses presumably under the same selection pressures. the original usage pattern V was re-mapped for each virus onto the new coordinate system based on these eigen-vectors. dataset 1 covered the entire genome and dataset 2 covered only their replicase open reading frame. the flowchart for studying the tetra-nucleotide usage pattern in 31 viruses is shown in Figure 7. tetra-nucleotides have overlapping subwords (e.g. 'UAGA' and 'GACA') the nucleotide composition has been suggested to be a specific characteristic in different virus phylogeny [25]. the number of components (k) in V increases exponentially with word size (n) - k = 4n. for the first criteria, there are pros and cons for choosing either longer or shorter words. nucleotides provide 256 vector components (additional file 2) and account for correlation of sub-words up to the order three. the bias in word usage (of size n) is influenced by the bias of word with sizes less than n [26]. the bias in word usage (of size n) is influenced by the bias of word with sizes less than n. correlation coefficient r measures the degree of linear relationship between two vectors. the two vectors are the tetra-nucleotide word usage pattern V corresponding to each viral genome. the magnitude of r is always between -1 and +1 and the relationship between the two variables will approach perfect linearity. neighbor-joining method (NJ) algorithm was used to construct a relationship tree. the neighbor-joining method is based on minimum-distance principle. the neighbor-joining method is based on minimum-distance principle. the original usage pattern V was re-mapped for each virus onto the new coordinate system based on these eigen-vectors. the difference between approach two and approach one is discussed in the results and discussion section. authors read and approved the final manuscript. we wish to thank Dr Ralf Altmeyer for his critical interest for this work. he came at the head of the HKU-Pasteur research centre."}
