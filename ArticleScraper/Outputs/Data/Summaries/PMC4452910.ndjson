{"summary": "Coronaviruses are divided into four genera named Alpha-, Beta-, Delta-, and Gammacoronavirus, based on the phylogenetic distance of highly conserved domains. the four viruses are responsible for mild upper-respiratory tract infections, yet cause more severe respiratory pathologies. the first isolation of HCoV-OC43 from a nasopharyngeal wash was reported in 1967. the genome of HCoV-OC43 consists of a positive sense, single-stranded RNA molecule, which is 30,738 bases in length, encoding 11 ORFs. the last third towards the 3' end containing genes coding the hemagglutinin esterase (HE), the spike glycoprotein (S), the envelop in 2006, Vabret et al. observed the co-circulation of genetic variants inside the species HCoV-OC43 by analysing the partial S gene (nt 23,449 to 26,332, reference to HCoV-OC43 ATCC-VR759 AY391777) they observed four genetically distinct subgroups. one of the subgroups constitutes an outlier group located between HCoV-OC43 and Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) this study focuses on the sequences of the nsp12, S, and N genes of 15 HCoV-OC43s detected in respiratory specimens sampled from 2001 to 2013. results 2.1. Sequencing of nsp12, S, and N genes of the 15 HCoV-OC43s and the prototype strain VR759.

Genotypes B and C are predicted to have emerged in 1982 (95% HPD, 1980 to 1983). the sequences of HCoV-OC43s were named according to the following nomenclature: Virus/FRA-EPI/location of sampling/year of sampling/specimen number. for the prototype strain, the specimen number is replaced by VR759.

Lau and his colleagues were the first to propose a genotypic classification of HCoV-OC43. four genotypes\u2014A, B, C, and D\u2014were identified. the infections were located in upper and lower respiratory airways. the presence of associated gastrointestinal symptoms should be noted. the prototype strain HCoV-OC43 ATCC VR759 was used as a control. alignments of complete sequences of three genes\u2014nsp12, S, and N\u2014of the 15 HCoV-OC43s used in this study were generated and enriched by the addition of the corresponding sequences of several complete HCoV-OC43 genomes available in GenBank. these sequences correspond to 41 HCoV-OC43s identified in the USA between 1983 and 2000. a comparative study of the topology of phylogenetic trees corresponding to several genes of the same virus is often used in phylogeny to define recombinant viruses. from here, we defined 13 different genotypes, of which four were non-recombinant (AAA, BBB, CCC, and EEE) the nine remaining genotypes correspond to different recombinant genotypes. the limited number of sequences studied in time and space does not allow for conclusive evidence of a possible temporal and spatial distribution of different genotypes HCoV-OC43. data suggest that cluster E has been circulating since the 1940s after being the first known group to differentiate from BCoV. this deletion is expressed in all BCoVs, and described in bovine coronaviruses associated with both enteric and respiratory tropisms. the deletion of 12 nucleotides is found in only 27 of these 27 sequences. four correspond to HCoV-OC43s detected in france. two correspond to HCoV-OC43s deposited by Browlin et al. under patent in the united kingdom. the authors proposed an alternative theory of origin for all coronaviruses. they estimate the tMRCA of coronaviruses infecting mammalian species. they estimate the tMRCA of coronaviruses at about 293 million years. the evolution of circulating HCoV-OC43 epidemic strains would have been marked by the occurrence of an insertion of four amino acids, TQDG, in the N-terminal region of the S1 attachment protein. the pursuit of this study should lead to a means of determining the functional impact of this insertion. HK04_02 strain defined by Lau et al. as a genotype D, referring to a recombination virus belonging to the B cluster on the nsp12 sequence and to the C cluster on the S and N sequences. the UNT1 cluster or \"Untyped 1\" corresponds to a group close to the preceding cluster. the UNT1 cluster includes only five HCoV-OC43s. HCoV-OC43 was detected using a real-time quantitative RT-PCR. a culture supernatant of the prototype strains VR759 was used as reference. this study OC43_P_13896R rev TTCACCAATTTGTCCGCAAAC RdRp 13907-13889 this study OC43_P_13645F fwd GCCACACATTGTACGCAAGG RdRp 13649-13668 this study OC43_P_14511R rev CCGCTTGTTATAGCGGCAAC RdRp 14515-14496 this study OC43_P1_4375F this study OC43_S_24384R rev GTGAAAGYGCCATGCCTAAA S 24391-24372 this study LPW 6447F fwd CTTCAAAGAACTATGGCATT S 24198-24217 Lau et al. 2011 LPW 2095F fwd TGATGCTGCTAAGATATATGG S 24804-24824 Lau et al. 2011 OC43_S_24569R rev AACCTC RNA Extraction and Quantitative RT-PCR Total nucleic acids of 300 L of clinical specimens and VR759 cultures supernatant were extracted using the QiAsymphony automate and the QIAsynphony virus/bacteria kit. a set of 17 overlapping RT-PCR products, from 600 to 900 nucleotides, were generated. twelve primers were used to amplify and sequence the nsp12 gene. this gene is located in the last third of the HCoV-OC43 genome.
