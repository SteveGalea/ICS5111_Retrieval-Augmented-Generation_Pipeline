{"summary": "the use of DNA microarrays has created robust molecular phenotypes for many tumours, including brain [1,2], breast [3-10], colon [11,12], gastric [13], kidney [14], leukaemia [15-17], lymphoma [18-20], lung [21-23], mela-noma [24], ovary [25-28], prostate [29-32] and small, round blue-cell tumours of childhood [33]. the microarray comparing van't Veer and van de Vijver prognostic signature to St Gallen criteria Avon Foundation Daniel Haber, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA Breast cancer. the encouraging early results from the DNA microarray technology have inspired the development of a variety of array-based platforms. a system-wide study of proteins -- the field of modern pro-teomics -- is developing quickly. proteome-based strategy is being used for early detection of ovarian cancer in high-risk women. a reliable screening test would represent a major step forward in the diagnostic capabilities of the physicians who treat them. a reliable screening test would represent a major step forward in the diagnostic capabilities of the physicians who treat them. the first study by van't Veer et al [6] identified a molecular profile of 70 genes that could be used to predict which patients, in a group of young women diagnosed with stage I-II breast cancer who did not have axillary lymph nodes, will develop distant metastases within five years. nearly 20% of women treated appropriately for their primary breast cancer will develop metastatic disease and, thus, are the best candidates for adjuvant therapy. van't Veer and colleagues applied the 70-gene expression profile to the patient cohort in their study. the application allowed them to accurately differentiate between low-risk and high-risk women. the prognostic value of the 70-gene expression profile was an accurate predictor of the risk of distant metastases within five years than the conventional consensus criteria. the Dutch team is ready to use this information in a trial of 5,000 women with stage I-II breast cancer. it will be interesting to learn whether or not the gene expression profile will be validated in a larger group of women. a small percentage of women will be misclassified as having a 'good-prognosis signature' a proteomics approach is being used for early detection of ovarian cancer. a proteomics approach is being used for early detection of a variety of cancers. the development of dependable serum markers for early detection of ovarian cancer would improve survival rate. clinical trials using proteomic analysis Sponsor principal investigator, centre Disease, application NCI Elise Kohn, Warren Grant Magnuson Clinical Center, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA Breast and ovarian cancer. protein microarray to assess response to EGFR inhibitors and Gleevac NCI Susan Bates, Warren Grant Magnuson Clinical Center, NIH. validation of 116 unknown serum samples resulted in a highly accurate classification of patients without ovarian cancer. the positive predictive value for the sample set was 94 per cent, compared with 35 per cent for the CA-125 serum marker for the same samples. the results of the trial will be important for a better understanding of epithelial ovarian tumours. clinical application at the NCI involves a phase II clinical trial studying the type III receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib mesylate, for the treatment of women with epithelial ovarian cancer. biopsies are taken from the primary tumour prior to the initiation of therapy; four weeks into the treatment regimen, a protein microarray is used to determine whether the receptor tyrosine kinase pathways are active."}
