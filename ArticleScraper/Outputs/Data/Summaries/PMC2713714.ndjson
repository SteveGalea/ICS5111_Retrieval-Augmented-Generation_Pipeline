{"summary": "the invasive cancer incidence decreased by 47.8% during 1995\u20132006. the carcinoma in situ incidence increased 1.7-fold during 1995\u20132000, and decreased by 19.6% during 2000\u20132006. the national Cervical Cancer Screening Registry was launched in 1995. all Pap smears were reviewed according to 2001 Bethesda system. any high-grade lesion or worse detected was automatically referred to the follow-up system. 5.6 million eligible women participated in the screening programme at least once. in situ per 100 000 women increased from 23.9 in 1995 to 69.2 in 1999. the age-adjusted incidence of invasive cancer and carcinoma in situ rapidly reduced in 2003 and rebounded in 2004 might be due to reduction in screening and confirmatory diagnosis. the incidence of invasive cervical adenocarcinoma decreased from 2000 to 2006 showing a reduction percentage of 15.4% (from 2.6 to 2.2), 31.3% (from 6.4 to 4.4), 21.0% (from 6.2 to 4.9), 31.9% (from 4.7 to 3.2) and 7.9% (from 3.8 to 3.5 per 100 000), respectively. the reduction in cervical adenocarcinoma incidence was not observed in all regions where extended tip spatula was used. the awareness of adenocarcinoma in situ as precancerous lesions facilitated early detection of malignant lesions."}
