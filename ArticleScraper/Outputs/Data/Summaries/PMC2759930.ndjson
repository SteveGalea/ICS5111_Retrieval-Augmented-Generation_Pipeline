{"summary": "fusion peptide-like domain positioned at residues 264 to 290 within envelope glycoprotein E1 mediates binding of the virus to target cell receptors. mutants with Ala and Asn substitutions for residues conserved between HCV and E proteins of flaviviruses or the fusion proteins of paramyxoviruses were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis. hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an enveloped, positive-stranded RNA virus. more than six distinct genotypes exist, with genotypes 1a and 1b the most prevalent worldwide. the viral genome is translated into a 3000-amino acid (aa)-long polyprotein. oplasmic reticula (ER) is proposed site for HCV assembly and budding. transmembrane domains of E1 and E2 also play a role in assembly of an E1E2 heterodimer. various pseudotype viruses (HCVpp) were developed in the past as mimics to study virus-cell interactions. occludin was recently shown to play a critical role in viral entry. the entry of both HCVpp and HCVcc is mediated by E1 and E2 in a pH-dependent manner [15,21,25-27,44]. proteins lead to transition from a prefusion, dimeric E protein to a fusion-competent -sheet trimer. fusion loop is exposed to and inserts into target endosomal membranes to initiate the fusion process. predictions of which protein (E1 or E2) acts as the HCV fusion protein remain controversial. segments in E1 and E2 suggest that both E1 and E2 participate in the fusion process. the group recently identified six regions in E1 and E2 with features of fusion peptides. they proposed that at least three regions, i.e., residues 270 to 284, which constitute the fusion peptide-like domain of E1, and residues 416450 and 600620 in E2 play a role in membrane fusion. mouse monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) directed against HCV E1 (cat. # C65198M) and E2 (cat. # C65167M) were purchased from Biodesign (Saco, ME), and the rabbit anti-HCV E2 peptide antibody (cat. # GB10416) was from Genesis Biotech (Xindian, Taipei County, Taiwan) these primers encoded the junction sequence between E1 and E2. the KpnI- and XbaI-cut DNA fragment was cloned in same sites in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). pCAGGS-sCD81/LEL-Ig encoded the large extracellular loop (LEL) of human CD81 (residues 123201) flanked by the 25-aa-leader peptide of alkaline phosphatase and the CH2 and CH3 domains of the human IgG Fc receptor. the PCR fragments were digested with XhoI and BamHI, and then used to replace the homologous sequence 3 106 293T cells were seeded into 10-cm Petri dishes and cultured for 24 h prior to transfection. pcDNA3.1-hCD81-V5-His-Topo [68] was used to amplify the coding sequences indicated above in an assembled PCR. two days after transfection, cells were detached with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.05% EDTA and washed twice with PBS containing 0.2% FBS. cells were then incubated with 100 l of FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. stained cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry. 293T cells grown in 10-cm dishes were transfected with 10 g of pCAGGS-sCD81/LEL-Ig. cell-free culture supernatants were concentrated 100-fold by centrifugation. two days after transfection, cells were lysed with cold PBS containing 0.5% CHAPSO. 2 days after transfection, 293T cells expressing WT or mutant E1E2 proteins were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine (NEN Life Science Products; Boston, MA) for 30 min and chased with excess cold methionine as described previously [72] for 4 h. 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 5 mM EDTA, and 0.15 M NaCl were boiled in 30l of Laemmli buffer. the immunoprecipitates were examined by nonreducing 10% SDS-PAGE. fusion assay 293T (5 105/well) and Huh7 (2 105/well) cells were seeded in 6-well plates 1 day prior to the assay. as effector cells, 293T cells were cotransfected with 2 g of pCAG-T7pol [74], a plasmid carrying the T7 RNA polymerase gene under control of the CAG promoter. cells were incubated with a 1:100 concentration of FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG. cells were fixed with 300 l of 4% paraformaldehyde on ice for 30 min. after washing, cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with rabbit anti-e2 or anti-p24. doma 183 (clone H12-5C) secretes an MAb that specifically recognizes HIV-1 capsid protein p24 as previously described. affinity-purified fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) was purchased from Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories (Gaithersburg, MD) Oligonucleotides 5'-CCATGTCACCAATGATTGCC-3' and 5'-CCTTCGCCCCCCCCCC-3' were used as the outer sense and antisense primers. mutants were used as the outer sense and antisense primers. pCAGGS-sCD81/LEL-Ig encoded the large extracellular loop (LEL) of human CD81 (residues 123201) flanked by the 25-aa-leader peptide of alkaline phosphatase and the CH2 and CH3 domains of the human IgG Fc receptor at the N- and C-termini. pcDNA3.1-hCD81-V5-His-Topo [68] 1E2, 3 106 293T cells were seeded into 10-cm Petri dishes. they were cotransfected with 10 g of wild-type (WT) or mutant E1E2-expressing plasmids. 293T cells were cotransfected with 10 g each of an env-defective, pNL4-3R-E-Luc reporter provirus. cells were washed with 100 l of FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG at a 1:100 concentration in PBS containing 0.2% FBS at 4\u00b0C for 1 h. cells were then incubated with 10 g/ml of the E1 MAb and FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. stained cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry. cell lysates were incubated with or without 100 l of concentrated sCD81/LEL-Ig. co-precipitated proteins were eluted from protein A-Sepharose beads. eluted proteins were resolved by 10% sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 293T cells expressing WT or mutant E1E2 proteins were labeled with [35S]methionine (NEN Life Science Products; Boston, MA) for 30 min and chased with excess cold methionine. at indicated chase times, cells were lysed with PBS containing 1% CHAPSO and the complete protease inhibitor mixture. viral pellets were resuspended in DMEM containing 2.5% FBS. the viral particles were normalized by reverse transcriptase (RT) activity. each infection assay was performed in triplicate wells. 293T effector cells were detached from the dishes by treatment with 0.05% EDTA in PBS and resuspended in DMEM containing 10% FBS. the cocultures were bathed in PBS at pH 5.0 for 2 min at 37\u00b0C. each cell fusion assay was performed in triplicate wells. the immunostained cells were stained with rabbit anti-E2 or anti-p24. we characterized the effects of amino acid substitutions for conserved residues in this region on viral infection. this internal hydrophobic region bears similarities to the predicted fusion peptide from E proteins of flaviviruses. fusion protein of paramyxoviruses is similar to the predicted fusion peptide of flaviviruses. the spacing of Gly residues is similar to those within the fusion peptides of paramyxoviruses. mutants were constructed by substitutions of Ala or Asn for conserved residues. ly residues located in the C-terminal segment of this region were constructed by oligonucleotide-directed PCR overlap extension mutagenesis. 293T cells were transfected with each of the WT and mutant plasmids, and cell lysates were subjected to reducing SDS-PAGE followed by blotting. 293T cells in two sets were transfected with pcDNA3 (marked as the control) or with each of the WT and mutant proteins. one set of cells was assessed for total E1 expression (B) and the other for E1 cell surface expression (C) using an E1 MAb. the total and cell surface expressions of E2 expressed by these mutants did not affect levels of intracellular or cell surface-bound E2. the low levels of E1 and E2 detected on the cell surface were not unexpected since HCV E1 and E2 are predominantly retained in ER after synthesis. these results together indicate that mutations in this region did not greatly affect the synthesis of or processing into E1 and E2 proteins. fusion peptide-like domain affected the cell fusion ability of E1E2 by a cell-based luciferase reporter gene activation assay. 293T cells transfected with the WT E1E2 plasmid without pCAG-T7pol did not show cell fusion either even cocultured cells were bathed at pH 5.0. the G267A mutant showed a higher level of cell fusion than did the WT protein. two days post-transfection, cells were detached, resuspended, and added to transfected Huh 7 cells. cells were treated with PBS at pH 7.0 and pH 5.0, respectively, and then incubated for an additional 5 h. the mean values of luciferase activities from three separate analyses with standard deviation are shown. plasmid was transfected into 293T cells to produce secreted sCD81/LEL. cell lysates containing mutant proteins were incubated with equal amounts of concentrated sCD81/LEL followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose beads. the precipitated proteins were analyzed by Western blotting using E1 and E2 MAbs. 293T cells were transfected with pcDNA3 (marked as the control), pHCMV-E1HA, pHCMV-E2HA, and WT pcDNA3-E1E2 plasmids. the isolated proteins were resolved by reducing SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using E2 and E1 MAbs. lysates of [35S]methionine-labeled cells expressing envelope glycoproteins were precipitated with H53, an E2 conformation-dependent MAb. similar levels of E2 were detected from WT and mutant plasmid transfections. also, comparable levels of E1 were coprecipitated with E2 from WT and mutant protein expressions. the G278A and G288A mutants showed reduced trans-complementation abilities to 9% and 40%, respectively, of that mediated by WT E1E2. the actual luciferase activities of pseudotypes generation from pcDNA3 or with WT or mutant E1E2 plasmid cotransfection are shown in Fig. 5B. amounts of intracellular E1 and E2 proteins were detected for all mutants compared to those of WT proteins. the three G267A, C272A, and C281A mutants showed comparable amounts of E1 and E2 incorporation into the virus. mutations at these residues resulted in decreased E1 and E2 assembly into the virus. virions were isolated by sedimenting culture supernatants through a cushion containing 20% sucrose. equal volumes of cell and virion lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. binding of HCVpp with alternative mutant E1E2 proteins to Huh7 cells was performed in the absence of permeabilization. the relative binding ability of mutant pseudotypes is expressed as a percentage of that of the WT pseudotype. results were quantified from three individual experiments with the standard deviation shown (B). binding of HCVpp to Huh7 cells may involve receptor-independent and -dependent routes. two Cys residues located at positions 272 and 281 are highly conserved among HCV genotypes. an Asp residue at position 279 is present in all HCV genotypes and some flavivirus E sequences. fusion protein of paramyxoviruses is similar to the predicted fusion peptide of flaviviruses. the spacing of Gly residues is similar to those within the fusion peptides of paramyxoviruses. mutants were constructed by substitutions of Ala or Asn for conserved residues. ly residues located in the C-terminal segment of this region were constructed by oligonucleotide-directed PCR overlap extension mutagenesis. 293T cells were transfected with each of the WT and mutant plasmids, and cell lysates were subjected to reducing

percentage of that of the WT pseudotype. results were quantified from three individual experiments with the standard deviation shown (B). some mutations in the E1 fusion peptide-like domain may affect cell fusion and viral entry of HCV. the other two mutants, Y276F and G282A, showed inhibited fusion ability as well as an impaired entry capacity. the role of this fusion peptide-like domain in viral infection still remains to be determined. mutations in this domain neither affect the overall conformation of E2 nor alter the assembly of E1 and E2 into a non-covalent heterodimer. similar levels of E1 and E2 were coprecipitated by an E2 conformation-dependent H53 MAb from mutant plasmid transfections. the differential viral entry examined by these mutants should not be solely attributed to their difference in binding to host cells, but rather to their differential fusion ability. the severity of reductions in cell fusion and viral entry of the mutants paralleled the conserved nature of these residues among HCV genotypes. these two highly conserved Cys residues located in this domain may directly play a crucial role in cell fusion and virus entry. this characteristic of the G267A mutant is consistent with the fact that Gly-267 is not conserved in HCV genotype 2 (Fig. 1A) grants from the Genomics and Proteomics Program Project (94M001-2) and Foresight Research Grants (AS97FP-L15-1 and
