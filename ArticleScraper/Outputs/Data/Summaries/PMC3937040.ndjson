{"summary": "feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) and feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) can infect cats and other members of the Felidae family. an infection with FECV is usually sub-clinical, except in young kittens where it may cause mild to severe diarrhoea. is, macropinocytosis, clathrin-mediated internalisation and caveolae-mediated internalisation. these latter pathways are distinguished from one another by their dependence on rafts, dynamin and Rho-GTPases. a second dynamin-dependent non-classical pathway is actin and Rho-kinase dependent but independent of rafts. transport in the cell periphery and short-range transport inside the cell is mediated by actin and its associated motor proteins, myosins. endosomes can be pushed forward by polymerising actin filaments forming an \u201cactin tail\u201d or can be transported by myosins over actin filaments. formation of actin tails has been described in a variety of internalisation pathways. myosins from classes I, II, V, VI, VII, XI and X are known to play a role during one or more internalisation pathways. but these myosins are associated with the first steps of internalisation being membrane remodelling and pinching off of the vesicles. FITC-labelled polyclonal anti-FIPV antibodies were purchased from VMRD, Pullman, Washington, USA. monoclonal antibody E22-2 recognising the N protein was purchased from VMRD. non-adherent cells were removed by washing the dishes two times. the adherent cells consisted for 86 7% of monocytes. between 20 and 60 cells were analysed per assay. the working concentration of each reagent was optimised qualitatively in internalisation assays with control ligands. Viability of the cells during the inhibition assay was tested for each inhibitor using ethidium bromide monoazide (Molecular Probes-Invitrogen) and was always over 99%. after pre-treatment, cells were incubated with polyclonal biotinylated anti-FIPV antibodies in presence of one of the given inhibitors for 30 min at 37 monocytes seeded on glass coverslips were pre-incubated for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. cells were incubated with biotinylated transferrin or fluorescent 1 m polystyrene microspheres. all cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. cells were incubated with phalloidin-Texas Red to visualise actin filaments. polyclonal rabbit anti-tubulin antibodies were tagged with anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 594 Zenon reagent. to visualise myosin 1, monoclonal anti-myosin 1 was used, followed by goat anti-mouse Texas Red. images were obtained with leica confocal software and processed with the GIMP. argon and Helium/Neon laser lights were used to excite FITC (488 nm line) and Texas Red (543 nm line) fluorochromes, violet diode laser was used to excite Alexa Fluor 405 (405 nm line) clonal antibodies against non-muscle myosin 1 were purchased from abcam (Cambridge, UK), rabbit polyclonal antibodies against non-muscle myosin 2a, 2b and 9b from Sigma-Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany) goat anti-mouse Texas Red, streptavidin FITC, streptavidin Alexa fluor 405, anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 594 Zenon reagent were purchased from Molecular Probes monocytes seeded on glass coverslips were pre-incubated for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2 in the presence of one of the given agents dissolved in RPMI. the working concentration of each reagent was optimised qualitatively in internalisation assays with control ligands. the glass coverslips were mounted on microscope slides using glycerine-PBS solution (0.9:0.1, vol/vol) with 2.5% 1,4-diazabicyclo(2,2,2)octane (DABCO) and analysed with confocal microscopy. percentages of cells with fully internalised complexes were calculated relative to the total amount of cells which showed antibody binding. monocytes were incubated with phalloidin-Texas Red (Molecular Probes-Invitrogen) for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C to visualise the lamellipodia. the glass coverslips were mounted on microscope slides using glycerine-DABCO. monocytes were scored analogously as FIPV-infected cells. infected monocytes were incubated with anti-FIPV polyclonal antibodies. cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 and MLCK was visualised with goat anti-mouse FITC. the internalising antigen-antibody complexes were visualised with goat anti-mouse Texas Red. internalisation of viral antigens is regulated by myosin light chain kinase. internalisation of viral antigens remained unaffected in the presence of bisindolylmaleimide I (a PKC-inhibitor), H-89 (a PKA-inhibitor), PKG-inhibitor and KN-93 (a CaMK II-inhibitor) MLCK inhibitor ML-7, could inhibit the internalisation of viral antigens to 12 21% of the untreated control. uptake of beads, the control ligand, was equivalently reduced to 11 5%. MLCK regulates myosin 2 both by phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain and by binding to it. cortical actin was stained (red) to visualise whether or not the lamellipodia were closed around the beads. results are given relatively to a control of untreated cells. asterisk marks results that are significantly different from the untreated control. myosin 2a, 2b and MLCK (red) during antibody-induced internalisation of surface expressed viral antigens (green) infected monocytes at some time points after antibody addition. Arrow heads in the MLCK row indicate antigen-antibody complexes were colocalisation was lost. all images show a single optical section through a monocyte. the images in panel h1 and h2 are actually different sections through the same cell. at later time points, cells with co-localisation were still found, but never below the actin cortex. we suggest that those co-localisations represent antigen-antibody complexes that just started to internalise at the moment of fixation. if cells are treated with ML-7, the association of the antigen-antibody complexes with myosin 1 was strongly affected. at 30 min post antibody addition, a small fraction remains associated with myosin 1. this is probably shortly before the association with myosin 1 is also lost. confocal images of the internalisation process at different times post antibody addition. the antigen-antibody complexes was visualised with FITC (green signal), myosin 1 with Texas Red (red) and MLCK with Alexa Fluor 405 (blue) the images show a single optical section through a monocyte. scale bars represent 5 m and arrowheads indicate vesicles which have lost the association of MLCK. almost no filamentous actin can be seen in the image of the monocyte internalising a fluorescent bead. the reason for this apparent discrepancy is that Jasplakinolide impedes phalloidin-Texas Red from binding to actin filaments resulting in a vaguely red cell. treatment of monocytes with Jasplakinolide gave a small but significant reduction in internalisation (76 15% of the untreated control) this suggests that a stabilised cortical actin network might hamper or slow down the internalisation of antigen-antibody complexes. the internalisation in the presence of both inhibitors was reduced to 3 5%. it is not significantly different from the inhibition assay with ML-7 alone. MLCK plays a role in the initiation of the internalisation process. quantification revealed a decrease in internalisation when monocytes were treated with Colchicine or Nocodazole, to 28 15% and 18 3% of the untreated control respectively. treatment with Paclitaxel also led to a decrease in internalisation. internalisation of surface expressed viral antigens is regulated by myosin light chain kinase but not by myosin 2 The serine/threonine kinases are the biggest group of kinases. internalisation of viral antigens is regulated by myosin light chain kinase. the internalisation of viral antigens remained unaffected in the presence of bisindolylmaleimide I (a PKC-inhibitor), H-89 (a PKA-inhibitor), PKG-inhibitor and KN-93 (a CaMK II-inhibitor) the internalisation of a control ligand was reduced to 25 13%, 33 29%, 14 7% and 23 16% respectively. the internalisation of the antigen-antibody complexes could not be blocked by blebbistatin, while the uptake of beads could. no indication of a role for myosin 2a nor 2b were found while MLCK clearly colocalized before the addition of antibodies. after 30 min, the association was lost. the internalisation of antigen-antibody complexes is mediated by MLCK but not myosin 2. results are given relatively to a control of untreated cells. myosin 1 was highly enriched at the plasma membrane, right underneath the viral proteins. as the antigen-antibody complexes moved further into the cell, they maintained their association with myosin 1. at 10 min after antibody addition, a loss of interaction was first observed (e.g. in the centre of the cell depicted in panel e of Figure 3A) myosins were visualised in red with Texas Red (Myo1) or Alexa Fluor 594 (myo6). the effect of ML-7 on the recruitment of myosin 1 (B) or myosin 6 (C) in the internalisation of antigen-antibody complexes. all images show a single optical section through the cell. the internalising antigen-antibody complexes resembles the MLCK pattern. the previous experiment indicated that recruitment of myosin 1 was most affected by the inhibition of MLCK. at 30 min post antibody addition, vesicles appear which still carry myosin 1 but MLCK association was lost. this is probably shortly before the association with myosin 1 is also lost. monocytes treated with Cytochalasin D or Latrunculin B showed internalised viral antigen-antibody complexes in a pattern similar to that in untreated control cells. monocytes treated with Jasplakinolide also internalised viral antigen-antibody complexes, however, the typical pattern of randomly distributed internalised complexes was not observed. cortical actin was stained (red) to visualise whether or not the lamellipodia were closed around the beads. confocal images show an infected monocyte at 30 min post antibody addition during treatment with Latrunculin B and ML-7. vesicles that have passed through the cortical actin network were still associated with actin in a way that resembles actin tails. this association of internalised vesicles with actin was still observed at 10 min after initiation of the internalisation, but was lost at 30 min. the internalisation in the presence of both inhibitors was reduced to 3 5%, which is not significantly different from the inhibition assay with ML-7 alone. internalised antigen-antibody complexes can be found in the centre of the cell. the primary route for vesicles to move from the plasma membrane to the cell centre runs over the microtubules. microtubules were visualised during internalisation of surface expressed viral antigens in FIPV-infected monocytes. the activity of each inhibitor was tested with internalisation assays of transferrin. a fraction of the expressed spike (S) protein and membrane (M) protein can be found in the plasma membrane in half of the infected cells. the plasma membrane was cleared from visually detectable viral antigens. the internalisation of these antigen-antibody complexes occurred via a new clathrin- and caveolae-independent pathway which did not require dynamin, rafts nor rho-GTPases. myosin 1 is involved in the formation of internalising vesicles. it could be that the binding of antibodies on the viral proteins induces a conformational change. co-localisation stainings also indicated a role for myosin 6 in the first steps of the internalisation process. myosin 1 co-localises with MLCK isoform before and during internalisation process. finding that recruitment of myosin 1 to the antigen-antibody complexes is hampered by treatment with ML-7. MLCK blocks catalytic activity of MLCK, preventing phosphorylation of its substrate: myosin [61]. the internalised vesicles are transported over microtubules. association with myosin 6 was lost while association with myosin 1 was maintained. the internalisation process could be effectively blocked, which enables the immune system of the host to recognise and eliminate the infected cells. such an anti-immune evasion therapy is a whole new approach to treat chronic infectious diseases and has some important advantages over classical anti-viral therapy. authors' contributions HLD and HJN conceived the study.
