{"summary": "SARS-CoV is classified as a risk group level 4 pathogen in australia. all procedures performed with the virus, including infecting cell lines and viral lysis before RNA extraction, were carried out in a physical containment level 4 (PC4) laboratory. cell lines investigated for their susceptibility to SARS-CoV are shown in the Table. in RPMI 1640 medium, confluent cells were infected with SARS-CoV. an additional flask was prepared in which the original inoculum was incubated under same experimental conditions but within a cell-free environment. cells were tested for virus-specific antigens with an indirect immunofluorescence assay 11 days after infection with SARS-CoV if no CPE was observed. cell lines negative for indicators of viral replication were blind-passaged twice for 7 days by adding 100 L culture supernatant to the cells in question as well as to the highly susceptible Vero E6 cells. a 10-L volume of eluate was treated for 10 min at 65\u00b0C. a 10-L volume of eluate was added to 12 L reverse transcription master mix. cDNA products were stored at 4\u00b0C until analyzed. PCR, 5 L template cDNA was added to ABI TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) containing 0.9 mol/L each primer and 0.2 mol/L probe in a total volume of 45 L. negative changes in Ct values of 3.6 represented increases in virus titer of 1.0 log10. Virus An isolate of SARS-CoV was passaged on 2 occasions in vero E6 cells to establish a high-titer stock. all procedures performed with the virus, including infecting cell lines and viral lysis before RNA extraction, were carried out in a physical containment level 4 (PC4) laboratory. CV-1, Hep-2, LLC-Mk2, MEK, and RK-13 cells were maintained in 199 medium with 5% FBS. confluent cells were infected with SARS-CoV, which resulted in a multiplicity of infection of 1.7. an additional flask was prepared in which the original inoculum was incubated within a cell-free environment. cells were tested for virus-specific antigens with an indirect immunofluorescence assay 11 days after infection with SARS-CoV if no CPE was observed. cell lines negative for indicators of viral replication were blind-passaged twice for 7 days by adding 100 L culture supernatant to the cells in question. 300-L volume of lysis buffer containing guanidinium thiocyanate and Triton X-100 (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) was added to 200 L supernatant from cell cultures that had either been infected with SARS-CoV or were mock-infected. samples were removed from the PC4 laboratory to a PC2 laboratory. 5 L template cDNA was added to ABI TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) containing 0.9 mol/L each primer and 0.2 mol/L probe in a total volume of 45 L. negative changes in Ct values of 3.6 represented increases in virus titer of 1.0 log10. Virus-specific immunofluorescence was read by using an Axioskop UV microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) the final results for the indirect immunofluorescence assay were based on the observations of 2 independent readers. the results obtained on 21 lines are indicated: 14 were tested for the first time, and 7 had been previously reported by others (15). cell-free sample had an initial Ct of 31, which rose to 40 by day 11. a cell-free preparation had an initial Ct value of 31 by days 7 and 11. this input Ct increased to a Ct value of 40 by day 11 after infection. titer increases 3.3\u20134.7 log10/mL above the input virus for these cells. blind passaging of supernatant fluid from these cell lines confirmed these results. in contrast, Ct values for COS cells did not change over the course of the experiment. this suggests that viral replication occurred at a low level, sufficient to maintain similar viral titers to those of input levels through several medium changes. this suggests that viral replication occurred at a low level, sufficient to maintain similar viral titers to those of input levels. input virus titers were 3.9\u20134.7 log10/mL above input virus titers. the ability of SARS-CoV to replicate efficiently in kidney-derived cell lines is not surprising given that its functional receptor, the metalloprotease angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2), is highly expressed in kidney tissue (16) the results for these 2 cell lines highlight the unreliability of CPE as a measure of SARS-CoV replication. we suspect human kidney\u2013derived cell lines might also support SARS-CoV replication. until the study by Gillim-Ross et al. (15), no human cell lines had been shown to be productively infected by the virus."}
