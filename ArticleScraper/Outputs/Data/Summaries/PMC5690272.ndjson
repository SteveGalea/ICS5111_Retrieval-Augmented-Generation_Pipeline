{"summary": "new approaches to research synthesis provide a much broader range of review alternatives available to health and social science students and researchers. public health emergencies have been identified worldwide, particularly related to infectious diseases. research synthesis methodologies have been developed to address the time-sensitive evidence needs of policy makers and practitioners in all areas of health care, including public health. research synthesis is relatively new in public health but has a long history in other fields dating back to the late 1800s. each synthesis methodology draws on different types of findings depending on the purpose and product of the chosen synthesis. each synthesis methodology draws on different types of findings depending on the purpose and product of the chosen synthesis. the final set of 197 texts included in our review comprised theoretical, empirical, and conceptual papers, books, editorials and commentaries, and policy documents. the team inductively developed a framework of the important elements of each method for comparison. each text was read carefully, and data for these elements were extracted into a table for comparison on the points of: key characteristics, purpose, methods, and product. quantitative synthesis Combining, aggregating, or integrating qualitative empirical research with data expressed in numeric form Qualitative studies Other types of data e.g., theoretical literature Narrative expression and summary Tables, charts, graphical displays, diagrams and maps Theory, theoretical/conceptual frameworks, or conceptual maps A definition Meta-synthesis [31]\u2013[44] Concept analysis [45]\u2013[47] Grounded formal theory [37],[48]\u2013[52] Meta-study [31], review [67]\u2013[68] Realist synthesis [68]\u2013[69] Critical interpretive synthesis [71]\u2013[74] Other types of mixed-research synthesis [49],[72],[75]\u2013[79] Additional File 1 presents one or more selected types of synthesis that represent the broad category. each type within a category has unique characteristics, which may differ from the overall group similarities. interpretive syntheses involve induction and interpretation, and are primarily conceptual in process and outcome. both quantitative and qualitative studies can be either integrative or interpretive. quality appraisal This is a contested issue within and between the four synthesis categories. there are strong proponents of quality appraisal in the quantitative traditions of systematic review and meta-analysis. however, there is no consensus on pre-defined criteria. the issue of quality appraisal is unresolved across the terrain of research synthesis. the aim of the research syntheses is to synthesize, synthesize, or integrate research findings from diverse studies. this helps readers stay abreast of burgeoning literature in a field. quantitative systematic reviews combine, aggregate, or integrate empirical research to be able to generalize from a group of studies and determine the limits of generalization [27]. the focus of quantitative systematic reviews has been primarily on aggregating the results of studies evaluating the effectiveness of interventions using experimental, quasi-experimental, and more recently, observational designs. the purpose of a realist synthesis is to find key concepts, examine the range of research in an area, and identify gaps in the literature. the purpose of a rapid review is comparable to that of a scoping review, but done quickly to meet the time-sensitive information needs of policy makers. the most systematized are quantitative systematic reviews and meta-analyses. the lack of systematization in conventional literature synthesis was the reason for the development of more systematic quantitative [17],[20] and qualitative [45]\u2013[46],[61] approaches. some authors in the field [18] have clarified processes for integrative reviews making them more systematic and rigorous. but most conventional syntheses remain relatively unsystematic in comparison with other types. theory can be produced from formal grounded theory, meta-study, meta-ethnography, and realist synthesis. concepts for use within theories are produced in concept analysis. narrative description and summary is used to present the products resulting from all methodologies. contextual features may form categories by which the data can be compared and contrasted to facilitate interpretation. meta-narrative synthesis [67],[84], because it draws on diverse research traditions and methodologies, may incorporate context into the analysis and findings. authors of emerging synthesis approaches have been very explicit about their assumptions and philosophical underpinnings. realist synthesis is philosophically grounded in critical realism or, as noted above, a realist logic of inquiry [93],[99],[106]\u2013[107]. meta-narrative synthesis is a construction of a construction, or a meta-construction. it is the storyline in diverse research traditions; in rapid review or scoping review, it depends on the focus but could be a concept; and in real world, it depends on the focus. units of analysis range from specific statistics for systematic reviews to effect size of the intervention for meta-analysis. in quantitative synthesis, the units of analysis range from specific statistics for systematic reviews to effect size of the intervention for meta-analysis. in all types of synthesis, the quantity of data can be considerable. the quantity of available data also has implications for the size of the research team. omission of key documents can influence the results of all syntheses. review standards have been developed for some types of reviews. but there are no agreed upon standards for qualitative reviews. conventional reviews include diverse study designs and data types. complexity inherent in combining results with diverse methodologies can result in bias. systematic reviews and meta-analyses do not provide a way of including complex literature. only certain types of design are considered and qualitative data are used in a limited way. limitations are that network meta-analysis has only been used in medical/clinical applications [119] and not in public health. qualitative syntheses aim to produce a theoretically generalizable mid-range theory. this makes them more useful than single primary studies, which may not be applicable beyond the immediate setting or population. the concept of saturation provides a sound rationale for limiting the number of texts to be included thus making reviews potentially more manageable. emerging synthesis methodologies were developed to address some limitations inherent in other types of synthesis but also have their own issues. a unique strength of critical interpretive synthesis is that it takes a critical perspective on the process that may help reconceptualize the data in a way not considered. the evolving nature of the approaches and their developmental stage present challenges for novice researchers. when to choose an appropriate approach to synthesis will depend on the question you are asking, the purpose of the review, and the outcome or product you want to achieve. defining characteristics of integrative syntheses are that they involve summarizing the data achieved by pooling data. defining characteristics of integrative syntheses are that they involve summarizing the data achieved by pooling data [49]. the enhancement model is reflected in systematic reviews and meta-analyses that use qualitative data to enhance interpretation and explanation. the epistemological model assumes that quantitative and qualitative data are equal and each has something unique to contribute. the epistemological model assumes that quantitative and qualitative data are equal and each has something unique to contribute. there are strong proponents of quality appraisal in the quantitative traditions of systematic review and meta-analysis. there is no consensus on pre-defined criteria; many scales exist. this has methodological implications for the credibility of findings. the issue of quality appraisal is unresolved across the terrain of research synthesis. defining characteristics of integrative syntheses are that they involve summarizing the data achieved by pooling data. interpretive syntheses include systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and scoping and rapid reviews. both quantitative and qualitative studies can be either integrative or interpretive. enhancement versus epistemological applies to approaches that use multiple data types and sources [80] the requirement for a well-defined question cuts across at least three of the synthesis types. there are strong proponents of quality appraisal in the quantitative traditions of systematic review and meta-analysis. there is no consensus on pre-defined criteria. the issue of quality appraisal is unresolved across the terrain of research synthesis. our discussion here is at the level of the four categories of synthesis. the aim here is to set the stage for a study by identifying what has been done, gaps in the literature, important research questions. quantitative systematic reviews have focused on aggregating results of studies evaluating effectiveness of interventions using experimental, quasi-experimental, and more recently, observational designs. a meta-analysis always takes place within the context of a systematic review. the aim of qualitative syntheses is broadly to synthesize complex health experiences, practices, or concepts arising in healthcare environments. synthesis uses a modification of the analytic strategies of meta-ethnography [61] but goes beyond the use of these to bring a critical perspective to bear in challenging the normative or epistemological assumptions in the primary literature [72]\u2013[73]. the unique purpose of a realist synthesis is to amalgamate complex empirical evidence and theoretical understandings within a diverse body of literature to uncover the operative mechanisms and contexts that affect the outcomes of social interventions. the lack of systematization in conventional literature synthesis was the reason for the development of more systematic quantitative [17],[20] and qualitative [45]\u2013[46],[61] approaches. some authors in the field [18] have clarified processes for integrative reviews making them more systematic. but most conventional syntheses remain relatively unsystematic in comparison with other types. the lack of systematization in conventional literature synthesis was the reason for the development of more systematic quantitative [17],[20]

meta-narrative and critical interpretive syntheses. concepts for use within theories are produced in concept analysis. contextual features may form categories by which the data can be compared and contrasted to facilitate interpretation. the findings in a qualitative synthesis are abstracted from the original reports and taken to a higher level of conceptualization. there is not an explicit step in the process that directs the analyst to consider context. authors of some emerging synthesis approaches have been very explicit about their assumptions and philosophical underpinnings. realist synthesis is philosophically grounded in critical realism or, as noted above, a realist logic of inquiry. meta-narrative synthesis is a construction of a construction, or a meta-construction. it is the storyline in diverse research traditions; in rapid review or scoping review, it depends on the focus but could be shared with those of primary studies in the genre. the units of analysis range from specific statistics for systematic reviews to effect size of the intervention for meta-analysis. in quantitative synthesis, the units of analysis range from specific statistics for systematic reviews to effect size of the intervention for meta-analysis. in all types of synthesis, the quantity of data can be considerable. the quantity of available data also has implications for the size of the research team. omission of key documents can influence the results of all syntheses. the quality of reporting in primary studies of all genres is variable. there may be flaws in the original study, or journal page limitations may necessitate omitting important details. there is a demand for more rigour, with more attention to developing comprehensive search strategies and more systematic approaches. systematic reviews and meta-analyses do not provide a way of including complex literature. only certain types of design are considered and qualitative data are used in a limited way. limitations are that network meta-analysis has only been used in medical/clinical applications [119] and not in public health. qualitative syntheses aim to produce a theoretically generalizable mid-range theory that explains variation across studies. this makes them more useful than single primary studies, which may not be applicable beyond the immediate setting or population. emerging synthesis methodologies were developed to address some limitations inherent in other types of synthesis but also have their own issues. a unique strength of critical interpretive synthesis is that it takes a critical perspective on the process that may help reconceptualize the data in a way not considered. the number of applications in the literature is growing with publications by new users helping to develop the science of synthesis. the evolving nature of the approaches and their developmental stage present challenges for novice researchers. the availability of syntheses helps researchers, practitioners, and policy makers keep up with the burgeoning literature in their fields. omission of key documents can influence the results of all syntheses. this issue can be addressed, at least in part, by including a library scientist on the research team as required by some funding agencies. it is possible to miss key texts. systematic reviews and meta-analyses have been important in launching the field of evidence-based healthcare. they provide a systematic, orderly and auditable process for conducting a review and drawing conclusions [25] despite their strengths, such approaches have limitations. new developments in meta-analysis can be used to address these limitations. network meta-analysis has only been used in medical/clinical applications [119] and not in public health. disadvantage is that many clinicians are unfamiliar with it and may incorrectly interpret results [117] qualitative syntheses aim to produce a theoretically generalizable mid-range theory that explains variation across studies. this makes them more useful than single primary studies, which may not be applicable beyond the immediate setting or population. they provide a contextual richness that enhances relevance and understanding. many emerging synthesis types are helpful to policy makers and practitioners because they are usually involved as team members in the process to define the research questions, and interpret and disseminate the findings. quality and publication standards have been developed to guide researchers, reviewers, and funders in judging the quality of the products. if the concern is about whether an intervention is effective with different populations under diverse conditions in varying contexts, then a realist synthesis might be the most appropriate. if the aim is to track the development and evolution of concepts, theories or ideas, then meta-narrative synthesis would be most appropriate. 5.1. Quantity of Data We raise the question of whether it is possible or desirable to find all available studies for a synthesis that has this requirement (e.g., meta-analysis, systematic review, scoping, meta-narrative synthesis [25],[27],[63],[67],[84]\u2013[85]. research or knowledge synthesis is an integral component [130]. but with few exceptions [131]\u2013[132], very little of the research synthesis literature mentions the relationship of synthesis to KT nor does it discuss strategies to facilitate the integration of synthesis findings into policy and practice. research synthesis neither makes research more applicable to practice nor ensures implementation. a limitation was that we searched the literature over the course of 4 years (from 2008\u20132012), necessitating multiple search updates. however, we did not do a comprehensive search of the literature after 2012. however, we did not find any new features of the synthesis methodologies covered in our review. there is no single answer to our question about the possibility or necessity of finding all available articles for a review. there may be no agreement about appraisal criteria in a given tradition. the decision to appraise is often grounded in ontological and epistemological assumptions. burgeoning field of knowledge translation has taken up this challenge. however, the research-practice gap continues to plague us [133]\u2013[134]. research synthesis remains relatively new to public health, health care, and social sciences in general. new approaches to research synthesis and new analytic methods provide a much broader range of review alternatives for public health, health care, and social science students and researchers. a SR is a review of literature that uses systematic and explicit methods to identify, select, and critically appraise relevant research. a SR is identified as the highest form of evidence in support of interventions. a meta-analysis is always a SR, but a SR is not always a meta-analysis. a number of studies have been published that do this [13],[75],[78],[135]\u2013[138]. some researchers are developing standard reliable and valid quality appraisal tools to judge the quality of primary studies. the reviewer is also seeking to discover the limits of generalization [27] a SR may include a statement about the relative \u201ceffectiveness\u201d of health care interventions, or about the appropriateness, feasibility, or meaningfulness of findings for particular purposes. the product might be a statement about the convergence of theoretical perspectives on a topic. the main concern is to explain the variation in effect sizes. if effect sizes are not reported, identify articles for information to calculate these. combine effects using several measures of central tendency. a meta-ethnography entails selecting relevant empirical studies to synthesize through repetitive reading while noting metaphors. a meta-ethnographic synthesis is the creation of interpretive (abstract) explanations that are essentially metaphoric. meta-ethnography is a form of synthesis for ethnographic or other interpretive studies. some researchers choose to follow pre-determined criteria based on critical appraisal. others do not critically appraise. a grounded formal theory (GFT) is a synthesis of substantive grounded theories to produce a higher order, more abstract theory that goes beyond the specifics of the original theories. the focus is on the conditions under which the primary study data were collected and analyzed to develop a more generalized and abstract model. theoretical sampling - sample size is determined through purposive and theoretical sampling strategies to answer emerging questions [37],[51]. Constant comparative analysis -the analyst identifies concepts and their relationship with other data, and compares theoretical ideas to prior and subsequent data. Saturation - the point at which continued data collection and analysis brings only repeated concepts or ideas. concepts are cognitive descriptive meanings used for theoretical or practical purposes. concept analysis generates a definition of a concept that may be used to operationalize phenomena for further research study [143] or theory development [144]. a scoping review assesses a much broader range of literature with a wide focus. includes studies using any data type or method. includes empirical, theoretical or conceptual papers. exclusion and inclusion criteria are inductively derived. rapid review of the literature provides a quick, rather than comprehensive, overview of the literature on a narrowly defined issue. the literature is often narrowly defined, focusing on a specific local, regional, or federal context. MNS is a new form of systematic review that addresses the issues of synthesizing a large and complex body of data from diverse and heterogeneous sources. the approach moves from logico-scientific reasoning (which underlies many approaches to synthesis) to narrative-interpretive reasoning. a realist synthesis is a review of complex social interventions and programs that seek to unpack the mechanisms by which complex programs produce outcomes. this is in contrast to systematic reviews, which aim to synthesize studies on whether interventions are effective. the logic of realist review is based on principles. the review question is carefully articulated, prioritizing different aspects of an intervention. it rejects a hierarchical approach to quality because multiple methods are needed to identify all aspects of the context, mechanisms and outcomes. a realist review combines theoretical understanding with empirical evidence. the result is a series of contextualized decision points that describe the contingencies of effectiveness. a realist review provides an explanatory analysis that answers the original question of what works for whom, in what circumstances, and how. CIS uses data from quantitative and qualitative empirical studies, conceptual and theoretical papers, reviews and commentaries. the process is highly iterative and may not be finalized until the end of the review. synthesis is based on meta-ethnography strategies of reciprocal translational analysis, refutational synthesis, and lines of argument synthesis. the aim of the analysis is to produce a synthesizing argument, beginning with a detailed inspection of papers, gradually identifying recurring themes and developing a critique."}
