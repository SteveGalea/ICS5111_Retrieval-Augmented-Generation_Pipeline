{"summary": "hyperplasia of the synovial lining cells, inflammatory cell infiltration and angiogenesis in the sublining cell layer. hyperplastic synovial lining cells overproduce such matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) as MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9 and MT1-MMP. IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor alpha are reported as key regulators of matrix degradation in RA. the study was designed to investigate the expression of CD147 on FLS and THP-1 cells derived from human monocytic leukemia cells [11], from monocytes/macrophages of peripheral blood and from synovial fluid in RA. patients and methods Patients Synovium tissues were obtained from ten patients (six with RA, four with osteoarthritis [OA] at joint replacement surgery or synovectomy. cells were cultured in 75 cm2 culture flasks (Costar, Cambridge, MA, USA) with DMEM supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 2% L-glutamine (Gibco), and with 10% FBS at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. when the cells had grown to confluence they were detached with 0.25% trypsin, split in a 1:3 ratio. THP-1 cells in RPMI 1640 without PMA were used as control (undifferentiated) cells. monocytes from heparinized synovial fluid of RA patients were isolated by the Dynal magnetic human CD14 monocyte isolation kits. the positive cell count and mean fluorescence intensity were determined by flow cytometry. expression of CD147 on surface of differentiated or undifferentiated THP-1 cells was also detected. total RNA was isolated from FLS and from THP-1 cells using Trizol. PCR analysis was performed under conditions: denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 2 minutes and then 25\u201330 cycles of denaturation for 30 seconds at 94\u00b0C. renaturation for 60 seconds at 56\u00b0C for MMP-2, at 58\u00b0C for MMP-9 and at 57\u00b0C for CD147 and glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase. hepatoma monoclonal antibody HAb18 is a hepatoma-associated antigen cloned by hepatoma monoclonal antibody from a human hepatocellular carcinoma cDNA library. hepatoma monoclonal antibody has identical nucleotide acid and amino acid sequences with those of CD147. the gels were stained with 0.5% Coomassie blue (R-250) and destained with buffer consisting of 20% methanol, 10% acetic acid and 70% distilled water for 30 minutes. zymography gels were scanned and analyzed using US National Institutes of Health Image 1.6 software. the cells that invaded through the filter in five microscopic fields were counted in each filter. the data were expressed as the average cell number of 15 fields. the same method was used to detect the invasive ability of FLS co-cultured with human monocytes/macrophages. the cells were cultured in 75 cm2 culture flasks (Costar, Cambridge, MA, USA) with DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) the cells were cultured in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. the cells used for our experiments were at the third to fifth passage. cells (5 105 to 106 per ml) were seeded in RPMI 1640 serum medium with 200 nM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) for 24 hours. monocytes from heparinized synovial fluid of RA patients were isolated by the ficoll\u2013Hypaque gradient centrifugation method. anti-CD147 monoclonal antibody IgG1 or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated mouse IgG1 used as the isotype control. cells were washed with PBS and then analyzed by a flow cytometry. expression of CD147 on surface of differentiated or undifferentiated THP-1 cells was also detected. PCR analysis was performed under conditions: denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 2 minutes and then 25\u201330 cycles of denaturation for 30 seconds at 94\u00b0C. renaturation for 60 seconds at 56\u00b0C for MMP-2, at 58\u00b0C for MMP-9 and at 57\u00b0C for CD147. the binding site of AP-9 was confirmed to be the HAB18G/CD147 molecule in the infected 293 cells. AP-9 effectively blocked the binding sites of HAb18G/CD147 on the cytomembrane and on the unit membrane in the cytoplasm of the 293 cells. hepatoma monoclonal antibody HAb18 from a human hepatocellular carcinoma cDNA library. gels were stained with 0.5% coomassie blue (R-250) and destained with 0.5% coomassie blue (R-250) for 30 minutes. zymography gels were scanned and analyzed using US national institutes of health image 1.6 software. a dried layer of matrigel matrix was rehydrated with medium without FBS (450 l) the cells were then cultured for 24 hours at 37\u00b0C in a CO2 incubator. the cells remaining in the upper compartment were completely removed with gently swabbing. 147 on RA FLS and OA FLS was no different (P > 0.05; Table 1).

Glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as the inner parameter. values (ratio of density = experiment/GAPDH) are the means standard error. the value of proMMP-2 and MMP-2 activity of RA FLS was higher than that of OA FLS. the value of proMMP-9, MMP-9 and proMMP-2 activity of differentiated THP-1 cells was higher than that of undifferentiated THP-1 cells (uTHP-1) (n = 6, P 0.05) secretion and activation of proMMP-9, MMP-9 and MMP-2 of human monocytes/macrophages from synovial fluid of RA patients were higher than those of human monocytes from normal peripheral blood. cells were cultured in serum-free media for 24 hours, and the conditioned media were collected and analyzed for matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity. value of proMMP-9, MMP-9, proMMP-2 and MMP-2 activity of RA FLS co-cultured with Mo-SF was higher than that of co-cultured cells treated by AP-9 (n = 6, P > 0.05) no inhibitory effects were found in irrelevant peptide SSP (n = 6, P > 0.05) rheumatoid arthritis (RA) fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) and monocytes/macrophages or THP-1 cells, and RA/osteoarthritis (OA) FLS alone. cells were suspended in serum-free media supplemented with or without AP-9 or SSP (200 g/ml) and seeded into upper side of the matrigel (5 g/ml)-coated chambers. invasive potential of RA FLS co-cultured with monocytes/macrophages from synovial fluid of RA patients (Mo-SF) and monocytes from peripheral blood of healthy humans (Mo-PB) no inhibitory effects were found in irrelevant peptide SSP (n = 10, P > 0.05) RA FLS co-cultured with undifferentiated THP-1 cells and RA FLS co-cultured with differentiated THP-1 cells. inhibitory rate of invasive potential in RA FLS was 39.53% and 22.8%. no inhibitory effects were found in irrelevant peptide SSP. expressions of CD147, MMP-2 and MMP-9 of differentiated THP-1 cells are higher than those of undifferentiated THP-1 cells or monocytes from peripheral blood of healthy humans. cytokines in the synovial fluid of RA patients may also enhance expression of CD147 on differentiated THP-1 cells. RA FLS and monocytes/macrophages from synovial fluid of RA patients were co-cultured with RA FLS in this study. the results suggest that the overexpression of CD147 on RA FLS and the monocyte/macrophage lineage may accelerate the production of MMPs and the invasive ability of RA FLS. CD147 antagonistic peptide was added in the condition medium of co-cultured cells. inhibition of MMP-2 and MMP-9 production indicates that CD147 may induce MMP-2 and MMP-9 production. the mechanism by which CD147 regulates MMP-2 and MMP-9 production is unclear. a correlation between CD147 and progressive joint destruction in RA is suggested in this study. this study based on the findings that the overexpression of CD147 on monocytes can facilitate enhancement of the production of MMPs. the authors declare that they have no competing interests. gel zymography assays, and drafted the manuscript, and is one of the co-first authors. he is one of the co-first authors."}
