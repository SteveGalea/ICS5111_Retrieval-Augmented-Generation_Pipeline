{"summary": "innate immune system has evolved molecular sensors and signaling pathways to detect, contain and clear viral infections [1]\u2013[4]. Viruses are sensed by a subset of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that recognize evolutionarily conserved structures known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) classically, viral nucleic acids are the predominant PAMPs detected by these receptors during infection. polyubiquitin binding has been shown to induce formation of RIG-I tetramers that activate downstream signaling by inducing the formation of prion-like fibrils composed of the MAVS adaptor [20] MAVS triggers the activation of IRF3 and NF-B transcription proteins through the IKK-related serine kinases TBK1 and IKK [10], [21]\u2013[23], leading to the primary activation of the antiviral program. characterization of the RNA structure demonstrated that blunt base pairing at the 5\u2032 end of the RNA was also important for RIG-I signaling. short dsRNA (300 bp) triggered RIG-I, while long dsRNA (>2000 bp) such as poly I:C and lacking 5\u2032ppp failed to trigger RIG-I, but was recognized by Mda5 [35]. intravenous delivery of the RNA agonist stimulated an antiviral state in vivo that protected mice from lethal influenza virus challenge. this report highlights the therapeutic potential of naturally derived RIG-I agonists as potent stimulators of the innate antiviral response. the capacity to mobilize genes essential for the generation of efficient immunity against multiple infections. 5\u2032pppRNA stimulates an antiviral and inflammatory response in lung epithelial A549 cells. a homologous RNA without a 5\u2032ppp terminus abrogated stimulation over a range of RNA concentrations. a homologous RNA without a 5\u2032ppp terminus abrogated stimulation over a range of RNA concentrations. ELISA was performed on cell culture supernatants to quantify release of IFN and IFN over time. kinetics of downstream RIG-I signaling were measured at different times (0\u201348 h) after stimulation of A549 cells. 5\u2032pppRNA induction of the antiviral response requires an intact RIG-I pathway. 5\u2032pppRNA activated the IFN promoter 60-fold and the IFN promoter 450-fold in wt MEF. promoter activity was dependent on RIG-I since these promoters were not stimulated in RIG-I/ MEFs. generation of knock down by transient transfection of short RNA did not activate immune signaling. generation of the knock down by transient transfection of short RNA did not activate immune signaling. A549 cells were either left untreated or transfected with a control siRNA or RIG-I siRNA. after 48 h, 5\u2032pppRNA (10 ng/mL) was transfected. at 8 h after treatment, pIRF3 ser-396, IRF3, pSTAT1 Tyr 701, STAT1, IFIT1, and -Actin were immunoblotted. some genes were highly expressed early at 6\u201312 h, including IFNB1 and the IFN family (IL29, IL-28A, IL28B), but expression was not sustained throughout the time course and decreased at 24\u201348 h. a second subset of genes associated with the antiviral response were induced early at 6\u20138 h, but expression was markedly augmented at 24\u201348 h. genes among the top up-regulated genes were selected based on three different expression patterns: early, sustained, late. a functional clustering of 5\u2032pppRNA-induced DEGs was performed. at 6 h, expression of several cytokine and chemokine genes were also up-regulated. the contribution of type I IFN to the antiviral response stimulated by 5\u2032pppRNA is unquestionable. other factors may also augment the antiviral state established by 5\u2032pppRNA. gene expression profiles of cells stimulated with 5\u2032pppRNA for 6 and 24 h. gene expression profiling of differentially expressed genes in response to 5\u2032ppppRNA and IFN-2b. samples were transfected with 10 ng/ml of 5\u2032pppRNA using Lipofectamine RNAiMax or treated with IFN-2b (100 IU/ml or 1000 IU/ml) the spectrum of genes differentially expressed by IFN-2b treatment were virtually all contained within the transcriptome induced by 5\u2032pppRNA treatment - 57 at 6 h and 134 at 24 h. some of the genes characteristically activated as part of the IFN signature and maximally induced by 5\u2032pppRNA are MX1, IFIT1, ISG15 (Fig. 5A, black portion) agent To determine if the RIG-I agonist was capable of inducing a functional antiviral response, a549 cells were treated with 5\u2032pppRNA. all viruses established infection in untreated cells as assessed by flow cytometry. in 5\u2032pppRNA-treated cells, VSV and DENV infectivity was reduced to 0.5%, while infection with vaccinia was reduced to 10%. 5\u2032pppRNA also had an antiviral effect against HCV in hepatocellular carcinoma cell line Huh7. the antiviral effect was fully dependent on RIG-I. PBMCs from three different donors were transfected with 100 ng/ml 5\u2032pppRNA prior to infection with dengue virus at an MOI of 5. the percentage of dengue infected cells in the CD14+ population was evaluated by intracellular staining of DENV E protein expression. in A549 cells pre-treated with decreasing concentrations of 5\u2032pppRNA (10\u20130.1 ng/ml) prior to 0.2MOI influenza challenge, 5\u2032pppRNA significantly blocked influenza replication at a concentration of 1 ng/ml. at 24 h post-treatment, cells were infected with an increasing MOI of H1N1 Influenza virus for 24 h. expression of influenza NS1, RIG-I, IFIT1 and -Actin was evaluated by western blotting.
