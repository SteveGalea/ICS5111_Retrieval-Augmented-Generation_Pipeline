{"summary": "zanamivir, another neuraminidase inhibitor, is currently regarded as the first line of defence against a pandemic until a suitable vaccine can be produced in sufficient quantities. zanamivir, another neuraminidase inhibitor, is currently regarded as the first line of defence against a pandemic until a suitable vaccine can be produced. 50 l of virus at a concentration of 100 50% tissue culture infectivity dose (TCID50) was added to each well and the plate incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 for 2 days. FITC-labeled anti-nucleoprotein monoclonal antibody was used to stain the remaining cell monolayer and viewed under an ultraviolet light microscope. chloroquine has a clinically useful inhibitory activity against influenza A virus replication. the IC50 and IC90 for both the H1N1 and H3N2 viruses are lower than the plasma concentration of chloroquine that can be attained with dosages used in the prophylaxis. chloroquine demonstrates an inhibitory effect against the replication of human influenza A virus H1N1 and H3N2 in vitro. it would also be interesting to determine the activity of chloroquine against the highly pathogenic H5N1 subtype."}
