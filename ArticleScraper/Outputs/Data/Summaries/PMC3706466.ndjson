{"summary": "the drugs currently available or in development for treating HIV-1 infection target the virus itself and its replication mechanisms and thus risk selecting resistant variants. studies of a simian model and more recently of human HIV-1 show that treatment during the acute phase of infection improves the immune response to the virus. dendritic cell immunoreceptor or DCIR [16] allows HIV-1 to attach to DCs and enhances HIV-1 infection in both phases [17] unlike DC-SIGN (dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non integrin), which is only involved in the early phase [18], [19]. interaction between DCIR and HIV-1 is a major factor in HIV-1 pathogenesis since DCIR expression in CD4TL is induced by HIV-1 or by DCIR is the product of the human gene CLEC-4A, which encodes a protein 237 amino acid residues in length. it contains an intracellular signalling consensus sequence known as i mmunoreceptor t yrosine-based i nhibition m otif or ITIM [25], a neck domain important for HIV-1 binding that includes a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) extracellular portion [26], and an EPS motif (Glu-Pro virtual screening has helped to find ligands and inhibitors based on crystallographic [31] and homology models of target proteins [33], [33]. ligands and inhibitors often yield enrichment of known ligands as good as that obtained by docking to a crystal structure of the actual target protein [32], [34], [35]. cells were grown routinely in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin G (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100 g/ml), and L-glutamine (2 mM) the culture medium was made of DMEM (Invitrogen, Burlington, ON, Canada) supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin G (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100 g/ml), genetic optimization Ligand Docking (GOLD) version 3.3 [43] was used to estimate the change in free energy that occurs upon ligand binding to a protein. a subset of 128,000 compounds with drug-like properties were selected for further analysis. seven top-scoring compounds identified by virtual screening were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Oakville, ON, Canada) or ChemBridge (San Diego, CA) for in vitro screening using our DCIR-expressing cell model. a stock solution of each compound in 10 mM in DMSO was prepared, and inhibitor concentrations up to 10 M were tested. NL4-3 (X4) and NL4-3/Balenv (R5) were produced upon transfection of HEK293T cells. 1106 parental Raji-CD4 cells were pre-treated with the indicated amount of a chemical inhibitor for 10 min. cells were then pulsed with NL4-3 as described previously [48] HIV-1 Binding/Entry, Infection and Transfer Experiments with CD4TL Apoptosis was induced in PHA-L/IL2-activated CD4TL treated with 30 M H2O2 for 16 h. to assay binding/entry, cells (1106) were incubated for 60 min at 37\u00b0C with NL4-3 (100 ng of p24) after three thorough washes with PBS to remove un-adsorbed virus, HIV cells were grown routinely in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin G (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100 g/ml), and L-glutamine (2 mM). the culture medium for HEK293T cells was made of DMEM (Invitrogen, Burlington, ON, Canada) supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin G (100 U/ml), streptomycin the proper histidinyl tautomer was selected manually to maximize hydrogen bonding. the proper histidinyl tautomer was selected manually to maximize hydrogen bonding. all aspartyl, glutamyl, arginyl and lysyl residues were treated usually as charged species. a subset of 128,000 compounds with drug-like properties were selected for further analysis. the database was used for virtual screening for the selected docking sites of DCIR. compounds were ranked according to their ChemScore and hydrogen bonding potential. CD14+ cells and CD4+ T cells (CD4TL) were then isolated from fresh PBMCs using a monocyte-positive selection or negative selection kit. cells were solicited from anonymous, healthy volunteers who had signed an informed consent approved by the CHUL research ethics review board. cells were kept in complete RPMI 1640 supplemented with GM-CSF and IL-4 in 96-well plates, in a final volume of 200 l. every three days over a nine-day period, half of the conditioned medium was collected and kept at 20\u00b0C until assayed. virus production was estimated as above by measuring p24 levels. the data are presented with SEM in order to hi-light differences from the mean. the data are presented with SEM in order to hi-light differences from the mean. virtual screening was performed for site A within a sphere delimited by a 10- radius around the OE1 atom of residue Glu231 and for site B within a 10- radius around the NE1 atom of Trp176. the top 100 compounds selected for site A and the three for site B are represented in Figure 2A. inhibitors decrease HIV-1 attachment to DCIR cells. cells were treated with one of four site-A inhibitors or one of three site-B inhibitors. cells were then exposed to NL4-3 virus for 60 min. binding to DC-SIGN is consistent with the selected inhibitors being specific for DCIR and inactive with DC-SIGN. these data are consistent with the selected inhibitors being specific for DCIR and inactive with DC-SIGN. both lectins are C-type and closely related with DC-SIGN. PBMC (2105 cells/200 l) were pre-incubated with DCIR inhibitors (10 M) (or vehicle) before mitogenic stimulation with PHA-L/IL-2 (1 g/ml and 30 U/ml) cell proliferation was stopped at day 3 by adding MTT reagent and SDS as described in \u201cMaterials and Methods\u201d. cells were then exposed to NL4-3 for 2 h, rinsed and maintained in culture for 3d. data correspond to means SEM from 3 independent experiments performed with triplicate samples. pre-treatment of CD4TL with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) mimics the apoptosis. expression of DCIR is also associated with this state and promote trans infection as we have shown previously [21]. cell-free supernatants were collected on day 3 and assayed for p24 content. data correspond to mean SEM of 4 independent experiments performed in triplicate for panel A. toxicity of our molecules is minimal compare to protease inhibitor or maraviroc, both molecules currently used in clinic. a model of the carbohydrate-binding domain defined by residues 166 to. 233 of DCIR was built from CLEC4M and refined using the SWISS MODEL website interface. about 33% of the amino acid residues correspond to the DCIR sequence. the proposed tridimensional model has four beta sheets and two alpha helices. the four compounds selected for site A and the three for site B are represented in Figure 2A. a statistically significant decrease in HIV-1 attachment to cells pre-treated with inhibitors A1, A4 and B2. inhibitors A2, A3 and B3 are the least efficient blockers of HIV-1 attachment. these latter three were excluded from further study in order to focus our attention on four molecules A1, A4, B1 and B2 for complete validation in more physiological model of primary cells. these compounds resulted from disrupted interaction with DCIR. dose response was also performed and toxicity was observed for concentration over 50 M for all four inhibitors. potential side effects of these inhibitors on cells expressing a large amount of DCIR were tested. this observation strengthens the conclusion that these inhibitors seem specific and not toxic. none of the inhibitors had any effect on the replication of HIV-1 in DCIR-expressing cells. no significant inhibition was observed six or nine days post infection. s were treated with four chemical inhibitors or DMSO for 10 min at 37\u00b0C. in some experiments, similarly treated IM-MDDCs were pulsed with NL4-3balenv for 2 h at 37\u00b0C, rinsed thoroughly, and maintained in complete culture medium supplemented with GM-CSF and IL-4 for up to 9 days. target CD4+ T cells (1106) were treated for 16 h with H2O2 (30 M) to induce apoptosis and the surface expression of DCIR. cell-free supernatants were collected on day 3 and assayed for p24 content. we have modelled the absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination and toxicity (ADMET) properties of our first four lead compounds using ADMET predictor. the results show that toxicity of our molecules is minimal compare to protease inhibitor or Maraviroc, both molecules currently used in clinic. the introduction of antiretroviral therapy in the mid 1990s had a strong impact on the course of HIV-1 infection throughout the world. presently available treatments target different steps of the viral propagation cycle, such as entry into the host cell, reverse transcription, integration and protein maturation. these have led to significant reduction in HIV-related mortality [56]. molecules targeting DCIR interfere with HIV-1 binding through interaction with viral gp120. this mannose-binding lectin is expressed on cells in mucosal tissue. this mannose-binding lectin is expressed on cells in mucosal tissue. in vitro experiments with Raji-CD4 transfected with either DCIR or vector only. compounds A2 and A3 were only weakly inhibitory to HIV-1 binding. compounds A1, A4 and B1 and B2 were relatively strong inhibitors. these inhibitors had no impact on expression of the HIV-1 co-receptors CXCR4 and CCR5. the results of the present study demonstrate that the selected DCIR-targeting inhibitors are effective in this model resembling the chronic phase of HIV-1 infection. we can predict that inhibitors designed to bind specifically to the CRD domain and EPS motif of DCIR can decrease HIV-1 attachment to DCs in primary infection."}
