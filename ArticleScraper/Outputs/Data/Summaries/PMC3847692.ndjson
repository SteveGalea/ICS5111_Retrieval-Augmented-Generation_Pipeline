{"summary": "the aim of this laboratory-enhanced, hospital-based surveillance was to characterise the epidemiology of respiratory virus infections among refugees living on the Thailand-Myanmar border. the camp provides shelter for 45,000 refugees. IPD treatment documented in 702/708 cases. all but one patient received antimicrobials, most commonly a beta-lactam. development of immunisations targeting common respiratory viruses is likely to reduce the incidence of pneumonia in children living refugee camps. 99% of deaths from either influenza\u2013or RSV\u2013associated LRTI occurred in developing world. other viral pathogens associated with childhood pneumonia include adenoviruses, human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and parainfluenza viruses [5,9]. Approximately one-third of the worldwide refugee population of 15 million live in camps [10] laboratory-enhanced respiratory surveillance was undertaken at the in-patient department of the maela PU-AMI hospital. trained local health workers reviewed IPD admission logs on six days each week to identify patients with an admission diagnosis of pneumonia. enrolled patients, health workers completed a brief symptoms questionnaire by patient interview and record review. laboratory methods NPA specimens were transported daily to the SMRU microbiology laboratory, which is located in the town of Mae Sot, approximately 50 km from Maela. Specimens were placed into an insulated cool box immediately after collection and were transported back to the laboratory within eight hours of collection. cT values of 35-39 were repeated only if the cT was 40 in both runs was the virus PCR considered positive. logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) laboratory-enhanced respiratory surveillance was undertaken at the in-patient department (IPD) of the maela PU-AMI hospital. trained local health workers reviewed IPD admission logs on six days each week to identify patients with an admission diagnosis of pneumonia. laboratory methods NPA specimens were transported daily to the SMRU microbiology laboratory in the town of Mae Sot, approximately 50 km from Maela. Specimens were placed into an insulated cool box immediately after collection and were transported back to the laboratory within eight hours of collection. data were recorded on paper-based case record forms and entered into an Access 2003 database. logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) forty patients (90.4%) were aged 5 years (Table 2). there were significantly more males in the 1 year age group compared with the older patients (64.7% vs. 52.2%, p = 0.001) children aged 1-4 years were less likely to have severe or very severe pneumonia compared with those aged 1 year (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4-0.9, p = 0.03) the rank order of detection was RSV (176, 24.9% of NPA), adenovirus (133, 18.8%), influenza A (58, 8.2%), hMPV (33, 4.7%), and influenza B (10, 1.4%). patients aged 5 years were more likely to have viral nucleic acid detected in the NPA compared with those five years or older. adenovirus (AOR 0.5, 95% CI 0.3-0.9, p = 0.01) or an influenza virus (AOR 0.5, 95% CI 0.3-1.0, p = 0.05) were associated with a lower likelihood of severe or very severe pneumonia diagnosis. multiple viruses were detected in 4.0% (28/708) specimens. influenza A (H1N1) accounted for 88.0% of all influenza virus detections in 2009. influenza B was not found in 2009, but in subsequent years accounted for up to 25.0% of influenza virus detections. nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens were positive for the virus by month. patients presented at a median of 4 days after symptom onset (IQR 2-6) eighty five percent of pneumonia episodes in the patients aged 5 years were classified as severe or very severe. children aged 1-4 years were less likely to have severe or very severe pneumonia compared with those aged 1 year. the rank order of detection was RSV (176, 24.9% of NPA), adenovirus (133, 18.8%), influenza A (58, 8.2%), hMPV (33, 4.7%), and influenza B (10, 1.4%). patients aged 5 years were more likely to have viral nucleic acid detected in the NPA compared with those five years or older. adenovirus (AOR 0.5, 95% CI 0.3-0.9, p = 0.01) or an influenza virus (AOR 0.5, 95% CI 0.3-1.0, p = 0.05) were associated with a lower likelihood of severe or very severe pneumonia diagnosis. multiple viruses were detected in 4.0% (28/708) specimens. influenza A (H1N1) accounted for 88.0% of all influenza virus detections in 2009. influenza A (H3N2) detections increased from 0% in 2009 to 73.7% of influenza viruses in 2011. influenza B was not found in 2009, but in subsequent years accounted for up to 25.0% of influenza virus detections. adenovirus, hMPV, influenza A/B, parainfluenza virus 1-3, or adenovirus were the commonest virus detected in the nasopharynx of half of the cases. the majority of hospitalised SARI cases were children less than five years of age. the majority of infections were in young children and only two infections occurred in patients aged five or older. influenza viruses were detected in almost 10% of hospitalised pneumonia cases. the role of adenoviruses in the aetiology of pneumonia remains unclear. in maela, almost all patients were treated with at least one antimicrobial drug. over a third (excluding adenovirus) had proven viral infection. the enhanced surveillance system had several limitations. not all hospitalised pneumonia episodes were captured. studies using multiplexed virus PCR assays have detected both an increased proportion of children with single and multiple viral lower respiratory infections. both human bocavirus and rhinoviruses may be detected in a large proportion of pneumonia cases, although data regarding causality from case\u2013control studies are still limited. all authors read and approved the final manuscript.
