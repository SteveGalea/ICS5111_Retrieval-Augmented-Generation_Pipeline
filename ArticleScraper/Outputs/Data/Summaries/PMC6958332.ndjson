{"summary": "the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program began in 1991. it funded work in several former Soviet Union republics, including Kazakhstan. since the early 2000s, the US doD has funded and implemented a Biological Threat Reduction Program (BTRP) the Russians recognized the need for \u201csentries\u201d which served in the network to respond and mitigate outbreaks by deploying teams to the field by horse, covered wagon, and rail. some of the institutes from the AP system in Kazakhstan, which included the lead Almaty AP station, supported the Soviet bioweapons program. the number of publications did increase in Kazakhstan during the period from 1996\u20132014. challenges remain among research programs in Kazakhstan including limited funding, improvement of infrastructure, need for development of programs that focus on merit-based advancement, fostering peer-reviewed quality research. the list of participating institutes in Kazakhstan has grown along with the number of projects and studies. the list of participating institutes has grown along with the number of projects and studies since the BTRP program started. in 2005\u20132007, the initial CBR projects centered on studies involving select agents including anthrax, plague, tularemia, highly pathogenic avian influenza, and brucellosis. from 2009\u20132014, five CBR projects were funded with up to $ 1M each, which covered labor hours, materials, travel, and infrastructure overhead. the BR program was not developed through a traditional, competitive grant-based system. from 2015\u20132018, later CBR projects were also developed and funded without earlier direct project links. from 2015\u20132018, later projects were also developed and funded without earlier direct project links. the project was successful in obtaining many tick and human samples made available by the Kazakhstani scientists. the downside for the project was a lack of sequencing capability on site and collaborators were unable to transfer any genomic material out of the country. KZ-29 and TAP-2 were performed concurrently and leveraged the same project resources to fulfill both studies. the study was designed to apply molecular methods to confirm the identification of ticks to the level of genus and species when the conventional visual identification was questionable due to inconclusive morphology. the number of peer-reviewed publications is often used to judge scientific merit. however, publications are often developed well after a project has ended. the number of citations from these publications also grew over time. Kazakhstani scientists gave at least one presentation for each project. the publications listed reflects those authored by Kazakhstani, US, and UK collaborators. ins J, Lukhnova L, Aikimbayev A, Pazilov Y, Van Ert M, Blackburn JK. modeling the potential distribution of Bacillus anthracis under multiple climate change scenarios. 66th annual Brucellosis Research Conference, 7\u20138 December 2013, Chicago, IL.

Yerubayev T, Nurmakhanov T, Meka-Mechenko T, Abdirassilova A, Yeskhojayev O, Vilkova A, Ussenbekova D, BTRP has specific objectives for reducing biological threats especially WMD. the research funded is a hybrid of pathogen research and disease surveillance. BTRP has specific objectives for reducing biological threats. the nature of the respective collaborations is important to consider as it often influences future outputs such as when publications are made and how further work is proposed and implemented. limited feedback from Kazakhstani CBR participants also stated the opportunity to receive external funding for research and publishing this work were likely the primary reason. a unified top-down and bottom-up approach that is focused on capability maturity also needs to be employed to ensure that funder and recipients agree on expectations and science objectives. the BTRP program continues to align outputs for long-term sustainability such as encouraging partner countries to establish their own external funding. the degree of collaboration in Kazakhstan is emphasized especially in teamwork to develop strategies and cooperate effectively. the ability to link consecutive projects through effective collaboration and funding pursuits builds greater capability and avoids one-off studies. vision is required to advocate a strategy and can be implemented through strong leadership."}
