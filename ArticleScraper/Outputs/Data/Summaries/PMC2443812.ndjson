{"summary": "improved estimates equip epidemiologists and virologists to begin to correlate these important establishing events with historical demographic changes, geographical invasions and zoonoses. archeological sequence data can furnish accurate dates and show substantial genomic changes associate with geographical invasion and zoonosis [7,1,25] the most commonly employed approach determines the divergence time of subtypes using a molecular clock assumption (MCA) over an entire phylogeny. current algorithms then estimate the rate of nucleotide substitution over all taxa in a given set. adherence to a MCA prevents direct inference of the rate during subtype divergence. the rate of substitution for portions of the phylogeny between the subtypes equals the mean rate in the initial host species population. this method may accurately reflect the rate within avian and human hosts but neglects any additional changes in the rate of substitution are due to the process of zoonotic adaptation. tinin gene generally and the hemagglutinin-esterase gene when referring specifically to the subtype C sequences. our estimator derives from the triplet statistic developed in [26,22,13], where each sequence member of the triplet draws from a different subtype. in this manner, each triplet member draws from a different subtype. the unobservable true values Dij of the pairwise distances differ from their estimates Kij. to understand this difference, we associate each Dij with an error ij. for time measurements, we assume that each sequence is labeled by a sampling time ti given in consistent units. p i j ( k ) is p i j ( k ) = K i k K j k t i t j ( 1 i j ). the factor i j = 1 + ( t i t j 1 ) log ( t i t j t i t j 1 ) + ( t i t j t i t j + 1 we have D i k = p i j ( t i ) + p k u ( t k + ) D j k = p i j ( t i j ) + p k u ( t k + ) D j k = p i j ( t k + ) + p k u ( t k + ) the above derivations express our rate and time estimates for a single triplet of sequences. for discussion, we label subtypes A, B and C (which are only incidentally the same as the labels for influenza) for discussion, we label subtypes A, B and C. global divergence time estimator is a variance-weighted average over i j ( k ) sub-stituting p A B ( C ) for the rate, = 1 P i, j, k i j ( k ) var [ i j ( k ) (6) where P is the sum of the inverse variance of each estimate, p i j ( k ). phylogeny of 60 influenza hemagglutinin nucleotide sequences from subtypes A-H3N2, B, and C. we reconstruct the phylogeny in (a) under a strict molecular clock via TREBLE [26]. the subtype A-H3N2 rate is 1.57 ( 0.38) 10-4s/s/yr. the subtype B rate is 2.20 ( 0.48) 10-3s/s/yr and the subtype C rate is 1.31 ( 0.33) 10-3s/s/yr. for the NS gene, the rates are similar to those of the MP gene. all genes are similar in dating the TMRCA for A-H3N2 to approximately 1965 (1964, 1965, and 1962 for HA, MP and NS genes, respectively) both the MP and NS genes date the TMRCA of subtype B to 1943, while the HA rate places the TMRCA at 1953. each of these estimates has a standard error of approximately 2 years. data from the hemagglutinin gene yields a pairwise rate of substitution between subtypes A-H3N2 and B, p A H 3 N 2, B C, of 8.66 (0.26) 10-3 s/s/yr. the date of divergence between the two subtypes is then 1905 ( 20) years. discrepancy between the two sets of estimates of the TMRCA likely owes to the inability of the MCA to integrate information from the period of evolution between the two subtypes. a substantial underestimate of the rate of substitution, and consequent underestimation of the date of the TMRCA. the phylogenetic divergence between subtypes A-H3N2 and B corresponds to a subspeciation event for the virus. previous studies using the MCA generally place a time of divergence of several hundred years ago, ranging from the 16th to early 19th centuries. serological analysis indicates that the 1897 pandemic was likely due to subtype A-H2N2. however, the pandemic of 1900 is of uncertain type, although it is commonly reported in the literature as being due to A-H3N2 [4] the triplet method requires an outgroup subtype to function as an origin relative to the subtypes under consideration. the structure of the triplet statistic requires an outgroup set of sequences, usually a closely related subtype. this method provides a simple and widely applicable way to calculate the dates of divergence of rapidly evolving organisms without the pitfalls of the MCA. p i j ( k ) = D i k D j k t i i t j + j = K i k i k i k j k + j k t i t j + j = ( i j k i k i k i k i k i k i k i k i k i k p i j ( k ) = p i j ( k ) = p i j ( k ) = p i j ( k ) = p i j ( k ) = p i j ( k ) = p i j ( k ) = p i j.
