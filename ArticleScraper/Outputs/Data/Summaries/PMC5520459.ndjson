{"summary": "some viruses use caspases to perform proteolytic processing of viral components. caspase-3 and -7 predominate, although caspase-6 cleavage is also used. caspase 14 appears to function only in keratinocyte differentiation (cornification) capsases 16\u201318 have not yet been ascribed functions. in these non-apoptotic processes, the extent of caspase activation is restricted in order to prevent cell death. apoptosis is a common response to viral infection. there is a selection pressure in favor of viruses which have evolved mechanisms to block apoptosis. some viruses actually exploit host cell caspase activity to facilitate their own replication. NS5A Modulates host gene transcription and inflammatory response 3 TELD/154, SAVD/389 (447) Exposure of nuclear localization sequence, removal of cytoplasmic localization sequence. papillomaviridae Human papillomavirus E1 DNA helicase 3/7 DMVD/49 (629) Facilitates viral genome amplification. amdovirus is a small, nonenveloped, ()ssDNA virus. it harbors a 4.7 kbp genome encoding two open reading frames. infection leads to rampant, permissive replication, causing apoptosis. cleavage is essential for nuclear re-entry of full-length NS1. a pool of uncleaved NS1 remains throughout the infection cycle. it has been postulated that the NLS-bearing NS1 fragment oligomerizes with full-length NS1. caspase activity is required for replication of several pathogenic H7N7, H3N2 and H1N1 strains. z-DEVD causes significant replication deficiencies in the highly pathogenic A/Bratislava/79 strain propagated in kidney epithelial cells. avian-like influenza A strains lack the NP caspase motif, instead harboring a D16>G substitution. a caspase-3-like cleavage motif is highly conserved. this protein is also cleaved in cells infected with the B/HK/72 strain. expression of the HCV core protein induces host caspase activity. 44 Activated caspase-3 then cleaves the nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) cleavage is ablated by treatment of cells with the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD.FMK. amdovirus The Aleutian mink disease parvovirus (AMDV, Amdovirus) is a small, nonenveloped, ()ssDNA virus. it harbors a 4.7 kbp genome encoding two open reading frames. in newborn minks, infection leads to rampant, permissive replication. cleavage is essential for nuclear re-entry of full-length NS1. a pool of uncleaved NS1 remains throughout the infection cycle. caspase activity is required for replication of several pathogenic H7N7, H3N2 and H1N1 strains. a lipid outer envelope, a capsid shell and a genomic ribonucleoprotein complex are also required for caspase activity. avian-like influenza A strains lack the NP caspase motif, instead harboring a D16>G substitution. this is important for host range determination, as substitution of the avian-like sequence into a mammalian H1N1 isolate reduced lethality by 68-fold. the virion is assembled on the surface of the viral factory membrane. the virus is released via a non-lytic mechanism. the virus is released via a non-lytic mechanism. NS5A alters host gene expression to force the host cell into a state of proliferation, while also disrupting the host apoptotic response. there exist more than 100 HPV subtypes, although only a subset of these cause are pathogenic. the HPV-31 helicase protein E1 is cleaved by host caspase-3 at (DMVD/49), both in a cell-free system with recombinant caspase-3 and in apoptotic cells transfected with E1.58 Cells transfected with uncleavable mutant E1 genomes showed a substantial inhibition in genomic replication. the presence of a caspase cleavage site may be useful as a diagnostic marker for differenti treatment of infected HeLa cells with pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD.FMK substantially increased viral production. infection is observed after 72 h in z-VAD-treated cells, compared to 48 h in control cells. pathogenic variants are grouped into two categories. low-risk (LR) subtypes cause benign or squamous papillomas. high-risk (HR) subtypes can cause malignant cancers. the presence of a caspase cleavage site may be useful as a diagnostic marker for differentiating high- and low-risk strains. there are more than 50 known pathogenic subtypes of human adenovirus, which are classified into seven species, A\u2013G. adenoviral E1A gene products, 12S and 13S, are cleaved by caspase-3. caspase cleavage occurs at (HLVD/24), removing an N-terminal sequence, then at (FQLD/150), then at (STLD/205) and (SILD/243).66 E1A gene products have several roles during adenovirus infection. the virus enters the host cell through receptor-mediated endocytosis. in the cytoplasm, the virus uncoats and the genome is released. caspase cleavage induces dissolution of viroplasm inclusion factories in the cytoplasm. this leads to mature virion formation and viral egress. the virus enters the host cell through receptor-mediated endocytosis. caspase-3 is responsible for proteolytic processing of capsid protein VP90 to its mature form, VP70. blocking caspase activity using z-VAD.FMK inhibits this cleavage event, while treatment with the apoptotic stimulus TRAIL enhances VP90 processing. the virus quickly spreads through all tissues, particularly the skin and musculature, inducing focal skin hemorrhages, arthritis, and stunted growth. the NS of ARV has an important role in the formation of viral factories. classical swine fever virus (NS5A) belongs to the Flaviviridae. infection causes fever-like symptoms and skin lesions. cleavage is blocked by caspase-6-specific inhibitor z-VEID.FMK. the function of NS5A cleavage is not yet known. this protein has roles in viral genomic translation and replication. it also appears to be involved in folding of translated proteins through its interaction with Hsp70. ascoviruses are a family of large dsDNA viruses which infect noctuid moths. each of the four members of this family encodes a caspase-like protein. each of the four members of this family encodes a caspase-like protein. the caspase induces a modified apoptotic response. nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) harbors a typical caspase cleavage motif at (DTTD/272), which is cleaved by caspase-6 in swine testes cells. this cleavage is blocked by the caspase-6-specific inhibitor z-VEID.FMK, and also by shRNA-mediated downregulation of caspase-6. several viruses utilize host caspase activity as a tool to penetrate the nuclear membrane. the parvovirus Minute Virus of Mice induces host caspase-3 activity. this activity leads to cleavage of nucleoporin 153 and enlargement of nucleoporin 153. e.92 The Heliothis virescens ascovirus (HvAV-3e) caspase does not induce apoptosis, but is required for viral replication. this process is required for host cell vesiculation and cytopathology. it is possible that the HvAV caspase is responsible for driving this actin reorganization. caspase cleavage inhibits intracellular viral replication. some examples exist of viral proteins which are cleaved by host caspases. the nucleoprotein (NP) of the TMEV is cleaved by caspase-3. a balance between apoptosis inhibition and caspase activation. many viruses have adapted to use this proteolytic activity for their own benefit. latent viruses generally prevent the death of the host cell. encephalomyocarditis virus induces the formation of LC3-II+ autophagic vesicles. treatment with 3-methyladenine or siRNA-mediated inhibition of Atg7 or LC3 suppresses viral replication. a third strategy is the use of host caspase activity to perform final maturation steps in viral assembly and release. the penton capsomere proteins of the murine encephalomyelitis virus are cleaved by caspase-3 activity. expression of NP suppresses the activity of caspase-3 in camptothecin-treated cells. this is taken to indicate that NP can act as a decoy substrate for caspase-3. sub-lethal caspase activation can be used to achieve non-apoptotic outcomes such as cell differentiation. other modalities of cell death are also \u2018hijacked\u2019 to facilitate viral replication. the individual reports are encouraging, but sporadic. a systematic survey of caspase cleavage of viral proteins is warranted. a cleavage event requires the present of a cleavage motif.
