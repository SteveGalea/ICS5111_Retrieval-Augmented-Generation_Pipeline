{"summary": "respiratory syncytial virus vaccine candidate RSV F (Novavax) was successful in a placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial involving 1600 older U.S. adults. it prevented 64% of severe RSV infections, 44% of all symptomatic RSV cases, and 46% of lower respiratory tract symptoms. the authors compared national health insurance claims record of 1994-5 and 2006-12. they found that the 2-dose vaccination correlated with fewer hospitalizations than both the pre-vaccination period and the 1-dose schedule recommended in 1996-2006. notably, age groups not targeted for vaccination were also protected due to herd immunity. the first candidate is an engineered antigen based on structural information about viral S glycoprotein. it was administered to mice and monkeys as a primer injection followed several weeks later by a booster. the second candidate is a collaborative effort of Inovio and researchers from U.S. and Canada. the better the match, the lower the mortality, morbidity and healthcare costs. a synthetic consensus anti-spike protein DNA vaccine induces protective immunity against Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in nonhuman primates. single-dose vaccine could have prevented 1.1-1.2 times more cases of cholera. single-dose vaccination can also translate into more people being immunized. the proportion of teens vaccinated against HPV increased in 2014, according to the CDC. 60% of girls aged 13-17 years and 42% of boys received at least one dose. 60% of girls and 22% of boys received at least three doses. combination-vaccine group reported slightly increased mild adverse events. recombinant seasonal influenza vaccine candidate (Novavax) was safe and immunogenic in phase 2 clinical trial."}
