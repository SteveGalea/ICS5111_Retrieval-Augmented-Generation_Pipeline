{"summary": "a protein related to hAT transposases was cleaving the MATa locus. two loci, one on chromosome A and one on chromosome D, shared homology with Tfo1. the kat1 strain displayed a normal growth rate. boxes denote genes and the Left (L) and Right (R) repetitive elements. MATa::URA3, HMRa::URA3 and two independently generated kat1 strains. arrows represent the SEM from three independent measurements. in the kat1 strain, a more sensitive assay was used (5). this assay relies on a uracil requiring URA3 gene inserted into the MATa locus. mating-type switching results in the loss of URA3 and resistance to 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) the ribosome can accommodate purine clashes in certain circumstances. a glutathione S-transferase (GST)\u2013Kat1 slippery site\u2013maltose binding protein (MBP) fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli because bacteria can use eukaryotic frameshifting signals. the frameshift-correcting mutation (KAT1+G) was introduced at the endogenous KAT1 locus in a MATa strain. the resulting strain was grown for 16 overnight passages in nutrient-limited conditions. after 10 passages the majority of the cells had switched to the MATa genotype. the results showed a dose-dependent cleavage of the substrate. cat1 generated two DSBs in the substrate, resulting in products of 45 and 145 bp. labeled products migrated with an apparent size twice that on the native gel. genemic DNA from mre11 containing plasmid alone or pKAT1+G was subjected to inverse/control PCR using the primers depicted in C followed by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. the active site of transposases contains a DDE motif (21), which is critical for the catalytic activity. expression of WT Myc\u2013Kat1+G results in a rapid switch of mating type to the MAT genotype. the precipitated DNA was analyzed using two primer pairs in the MATa1\u2013MATa2 intergenic region. the data were normalized to a primer pair from a locus not expected to be bound by Kat1. cat1 is an endonuclease that generates two DSBs in MATa. the transposon was circularized at two sequences that were recognition sites for the AccI endonuclease (GTATAC) in 18 (72%) of the clones, the two AccI sites either were intact or lacked a single base pair. sequence of cloned inverse PCR fragments covering circle junctions. alignment of 26 bp of DNA from TIR-L with the reverse complement of TIR-R. a putative consensus Kat1 site is depicted below. strains carrying exact deletions of the AccI sites in TIR-L and/or TIR-R. both sites are essential for switching under normal conditions. either one of them suffices when switching is induced by Mts1 overexpression. messenger RNA was prepared from an mts1 strain containing empty plasmid. level in the strain containing empty plasmid was set to 1.0. expression level was normalized to actin (ACT1) using comparative threshold (Ct) method. BLAST searches revealed genes encoding long (>700-aa) proteins highly homologous to S. cerevisiae HO in four species. the genes did not coexist in the same genomes, as is consistent with the idea that a KAT1-mediated switching mechanism has replaced an ancestral HO-mediated mechanism. a mutation of the first base of the octamer reduces frameshifting by 20-fold in the dual-luciferase assay. the reduced frameshifting in the C to T mutant suggests a potential role for the exit-site tRNA in KAT1 frameshifting. there are numerous examples of TEs becoming domesticated to perform functions that are beneficial for the host. cat1 cleavage generates hairpin-capped ends similar to RAG1/2 (34) and Hermes (13) during V(D)J recombination the hairpins are opened and then joined by nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) to generate mature V(D)J joints. the hairpins in K. lactis are channeled into a gene-conversion pathway dependent on the RAD50 group of homologous recombination (HR we speculate that in an ancestor of the Kluyveromyces yeasts an active KAT1-related TE was inserted between the MATa1 and MATa2 genes. this insertion may have rendered the ancestral HO gene redundant. since then, the KAT1-related element has deteriorated, but the signals for excision have been maintained. E. coli strain DE3 harboring GST\u2013KAT1+G or DDE mutants was induced by the addition of 1 mM isopropyl -d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) proteins were purified from 1 L of culture using glutathione Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) the reactions were terminated by the addition of EDTA (10 mM) and were resolved on 6% native/denaturing PAGE. cat1 cleavage reaction was performed by incubating the end-labeled 579-bp DNA substrate with increasing concentrations of Kat1+G. reactions terminated by the addition of EDTA (10 mM)"}
