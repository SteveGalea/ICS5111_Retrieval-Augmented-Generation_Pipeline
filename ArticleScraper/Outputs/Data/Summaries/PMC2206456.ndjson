{"summary": "combination of markers, as opposed to single ones, may improve diagnosis. 151 patients were eligible for analysis. of these, 96 had bacterial infections. sTREM-1, sTREM-1 and MIF had limited value as single markers. PCT and CRP exhibited acceptable diagnostic characteristics. studies have shown that high concentrations of suPAR portend a poor clinical outcome in diverse infections such as tuberculosis, malaria and pneumococcal bacteraemia. the use of sTREM-1, suPAR and MIF to diagnose community-acquired bacterial infections in medical patients has not yet been studied. all evaluable patients were included in the main analysis. the only protocol-driven procedures were blood sampling, collection of data for later calculation of admission Simplified Acute Physiology Scale II and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores. Mortality rates at 30 days and 6 months after inclusion were recorded. reviewers were blinded to PCT, suPAR, sTREM-1 and MIF values. the panel was instructed to disregard CRP levels and neutrophil counts. the panel was instructed to disregard CRP levels and neutrophil counts. mal sTREM-1, suPAR, MIF, and three-marker and six-marker cutoff values were determined using Youdens Index [26] because of a lack of reference literature. statistics Measurements of suPAR, sTREM-1, MIF, CRP and PCT were transformed using the logarithmic function to obtain normality of distribution within disease groups. prospective observational study was conducted from February 2005 to February 2006 at an 800-bed university hospital. all consecutive newly admitted ( 24 hours) adult patients who fulfilled at least two criteria for SIRS [6] were asked to participate. the study protocol is registered on the internet (NCT00389337) all patients were grouped into one of the following four groups: no infection present, bacterial infection, viral infection, or parasitic infection. classification was based on clinical findings, on laboratory findings, response to treatments, radiographic and other imaging procedures. blood leucocyte and neutrophil counts were measured using the Avida 120 device (Bayer Diagnostics, Tarrytown, NY, USA) margins of error for both the PCT and CRP assays were 3.3% and 4.8%. standard errors of the AUCs were obtained using the method reported by Xiong and coworkers [27], based on Fisher's Z transformation. all tests were two sided, and P 0.05 was considered statistically significant. results A total of 161 patients fulfilling at least two SIRS criteria were included in the study. 117 patients classified as infected: 96 with a bacterium, 16 with a virus and five with a parasite. from all but three patients, blood cultures were obtained at admission. a pathogenic bacterium was isolated from blood in 22 patients (15%). oedema, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation with no signs of infection, embolus of the lung. respiratory distress (n = 8), malignant disease (n = 8), intracranial haemorrhage (n = 2), allergic reaction (n = 2), noninfectious pancreatitis (n = 1), gout (n = 1), use of impure intravenous drugs (n = 1), ruptured mitral four patients had two sites of infection; two had pneumonia and urinary tract infection. one had meningitis and pneumonia, and one had staphylococcal skin infection and malaria. bClassified by two specialists in infectious diseases based on typical clinical presentation. recruitment, exclusion and subsequent grouping of all patients included in the study are shown in Figure 1. Flowchart describing the number of patients included in the study, the reasons for subsequent exclusions, the final diagnoses of the patients, and the ability C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT) and the three-marker and six-marker combined tests to correctly diagnose patients as having bacterial infection. individual admission plasma concentrations of the markers. shown are individual admission plasma concentrations of (a) C-reactive protein (CRP), (b) procalcitonin (PCT), (c) neutrophil count, (d) soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR), (f) macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) in patients with no infection (circle), bacterial (triangle, apex up), viral ( aSensitivity and specificity of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (sTREM-1), soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) were computed using optimal cutoff values determined using Youdens Index. optimal cutoffs were 59 mg/l for CRP, 0.28 g/l for PCT, 8.5 109 cells/l for neutrophil count, 0.81 g/l for MIF, 3.5 g/l for sTREM-1, 2.7 g/l for suPAR, 6.1 for the three-marker test and 4.1 for the six-marker test. dSix-marker test = 0.160 neutrophil count + 0.981 log(CRP this analysis identified AUCs of 0.83 (95% CI 0.76\u20130.90) and 0.77 (95% CI 0.69\u20130.85) for CRP and PCT, respectively, with regard to discrimination between bacterial and nonbacterial causes of inflammation. a ancillary analysis was conducted in which 38 patients with solid tumours, haematological malignancies, HIV infection, leucocyte counts below 1 109 cells/l were excluded. in this analysis the ability of the markers to diagnose bacterial sTREM-1, MIF and suPAR as single markers have limited diagnostic power to discriminate between bacterial and nonbacterial causes of inflammation. if combined with CRP, PCT and neutrophil count a high AUC of 0.88 is achieved. the majority of studies of new sepsis biomarkers examine these biomarkers one at a time. psis in patients with SIRS may be applicable to other complex diseases. only few studies have applied the statistical techniques developed by Su and Liu [27,34] the half-life of sTREM-1 in plasma is short (1.5 hours), and so our handling procedures in the present study might have been too slow. recent findings on plasma sTREM-1 in patients with pneumonia, COPD and asthma indicate no difference in admission levels of sTREM-1 between COPD and pneumonia patients. combining information from several sepsis markers is simple. it may significantly improve clinicians' ability to differentiate patients with bacterial infections from those with systemic inflammation of nonbacterial origin when they are admitted. single measurements suPAR, sTREM-1 and MIF appear to have limited power as diagnostic markers for bacterial infection. the diagnostic accuracy of CRP, PCT and neutrophil count was higher in the subgroup of patients suspected of having pneumonia than in the group as a whole. JE contributed to planning of the study and the analysis of suPAR, sTREM-1 and MIF. MT was responsible for the analyses of PCT and helped to draft the manuscript. all authors read and approved the final manuscript."}
