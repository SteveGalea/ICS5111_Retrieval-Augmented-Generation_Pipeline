{"summary": "functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of FcR genes (FCGR) are associated with human asthma and allergy. the aim of current study was to investigate whether functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of FcR genes are associated with human asthma and allergy. mediated inhibitory signals are a risk factor for atopy (P = 0.0031, OR 1.758, 95% CI: 1.209\u20132.556) but variants of activating FcRIIIA (rs396991), and FcRIIIB (NA1 and NA2) are not associated with asthma, BHR, and atopy (P>0.05). in humans, five genes (FCGR2A, FCGR2B, FCGR2C, FCGR3A, and FCGR3B) in the 1q23 chromosome region code for five classical low affinity Fc receptors (FcRIIA, FcRIIB, FcRIIC, FcRIIIA, and FcRIIIB) in humans, five genes (FCGR2A, FCGR2B, FCGR2C, FCGR3A, and FCGR3 the 27 multigenerational Caucasian families were recruited in Minnesota. they had 169 asthmatic members, 347 who were not asthmatic. the study was approved by the institutional review board of human study at the University of Minnesota. atopy, and IgE levels were analyzed in the current genetic study. FCGR family member genes were generated through duplication and divergence during evolution. a modified FCGR SNP TaqMan assay used gene-specific PCR fragments as templates instead of genomic DNA. TaqMan genotyping assays were carried out according to the standard protocol on an ABI 7500 Real-Time PCR System using Genotyping Master Mix. the specificity and accuracy of individual TaqMan assays were validated by the perfect match (100%) with at least 300 genotyped human subjects published previously [8], [9], [15]. the association between log-transformed IgE levels and FCGR genotypes was analyzed using one-way analysis of variance. the association between log-transformed IgE levels and FCGR genotypes was analyzed using one-way analysis of variance. the null hypothesis was rejected at 0.05/number of tests. study subjects were recruited from 27 multigenerational families with multiple asthmatic members. the inclusion criteria for each family consisted of each of the two asthmatic siblings having met the following criteria. the 27 multigenerational Caucasian families were recruited in Minnesota as previously described [13]. these families had 169 asthmatic members, 347 who were not asthmatic and 129 for whom the diagnosis was unavailable. annealing to the FCGR2C intron 2 and antisense primer (5\u2032-AAC AGA AAG AGA AGA GGC AGG GCT TA-3\u2032) annealing to the FCGR2C intron 6. the TaqMan assays for FCGR2A SNP (FcRIIA-131His>Arg), FCGR2B SNP (FcRIIB-187Ile>Thr), FCGR2C SNP (FcRI the FCGR3B alleles and genotypes were determined based on the published reference [16], [17]. Statistical Analysis The levels were determined based on the published reference [16], [17]. family-based association tests (FBAT) were used to examine whether individual FCGR SNPs are associated with phenotypes of human subjects in the asthma family cohort. conditional logistic regression analysis estimated an OR of 0.732 (P = 0.027, 95% CI: 0.555\u20130.965) for FCGR2A SNP with atopy. FCGR2A and FCGR2B SNPs are associated with atopy in family-based association tests (FBAT) logistic regression analysis also showed that FCGR2A SNP is significantly associated with atopy and that the FcRIIA-131His is a protective allele against atopy. the FCGR2B SNP is not associated with asthma, BHR, and atopy. the FcRIIB-187Thr (allele frequency = 0.088) is a risk allele for atopy (P = 0.003, OR 1.758, 95% CI: 1.209\u20132.556) FcRIIB genotypes are significantly associated with serum IgE levels. human subjects carrying rare FcRIIB-Thr allele produced significantly more IgE than homozygous subjects carrying common allele (187-Ile/Ile) FCGR2A SNP (FcRIIA-131His>Arg, rs1801274) is associated with atopy in the family-based association test (FBAT) (P = 0.003) the association was not significant in logistic regression analyses adjusted for age and sex. FCGR2A SNP (FcRIIA-131His>Arg, rs1801274) is significantly associated with atopy in family-based association tests (FBAT) logistic regression analysis also demonstrated that FCGR2A SNP is significantly associated with atopy and that the FcRIIA-131His (allele frequency: 0.488) is a protective allele against atopy. 2C SNP (FcRIIC-13Gln>Stop, rs10917661) are not associated with asthma, BHR, and atopy in family-based association test (FBAT) analyses. conditional logistic regression analyses showed that FCGR2B SNP is significantly associated with atopy and that the FcRIIB-187Thr is a risk allele for atopy. the rare FCGR2B-187Ile>Thr carriers produced significantly more IgE than the homozygous subjects for common allele (187Ile) in Mann-Whitney tests. no significant differences were found between FCGR2A-131Arg carriers and the 131His homozygous subjects. the functional FcRIIA-131His>Arg SNP affects the receptor binding affinity for IgG. it affects the functions of bacterial phagocytosis [23], [24] and immune complex handling [22], [25], [26]. the protective effect of the FcRIIA-131His>Arg on atopy is possibly due to the increased capacity of this allele to efficiently internalize and destroy allergen-IgG2 immune complexes. the low function FcRIIB-187Thr allele is significantly associated with elevated IgE levels. the low function FcRIIB-187Thr allele is also associated with protection against malaria [49], signifying FcRIIB. a GWAS identified the FCER1A functional variants strongly associated with total IgE levels. a dysfunctional FcRIIB-187Thr allele was found to be a risk factor for atopy. a decreased activation threshold for immune cells carrying FcRIIB-187Thr allele may be responsible for the increased sensitivity to allergens that trigger the allergic responses. the functional SNPs of the other three activating FcRs (FcRIIIA, FcRIIIB, and FcRIIC) were not associated with asthma, BHR, and atopy, suggesting that functions of the restrictively expressed activating FcRs may not play prevailing roles in the development of allergy"}
