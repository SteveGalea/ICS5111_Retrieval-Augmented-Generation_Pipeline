{"summary": "RCA synthesizes many copies of repeated sequences from circular DNA and RNA templates. it detects single nucleotide polymorphisms using a circularized DNA probe called a padlock probe. microwave effect is debated to be the \u201cThermal-effect,\u201d \u201cNon-thermal effect\u201d and \u201cSpecific microwave effect\u201d[19, 20]. MW-RCA was performed using a circular DNA template and four thermostable DNA polymerases with strand displacement activity. microwave selectivity heating is thought to alter molecular motion state compared with conventional heating. RCA template and primers were designed to amplify sequences encoding a zinc finger protein for the expression of an artificial repetitive protein. template oligonucleotide (0.1 nmol) was phosphorylated using T4 polynucleotide kinase (10 U) in 100 L of solution at 37\u00b0C for 60 min. the DNA concentration of the final sample used for RCA was determined using a nanoDrop 2000c (Thermo Scientific) all RCA reactions were performed in a final volume of 50 L at the optimum temperature of each enzyme in a 0.2-mL polypropylene tube (QSP) using a thermal-cycler (TaKaRa) the 96\u20137 DNA polymerase (Nippon Gene) was incubated in the 96\u20137 reaction buffer (8 mM Mg2+) at 55\u00b0C for 10\u2013180 min. a thermal-cycler was used to inactivate each DNA polymerase. microwave applicator was equipped with a fiber-optic probe for internal online temperature control. temperature measurements of RCA and buffer components were measured using a fiber-optic probe in the cold room for 10 min beginning at 13\u00b0C. the data used to plot the temperatures represent the average of three measurements. the samples (5 L) and a DNA marker (OneSTEP Marker 5, Nippon Gene) were electrophoresed for 30 min at 100 V. fluorescence measurements The intensity of SYBR Green I fluorescence emission was measured using a fluorescence plate reader (FluoroCount, Packard) primers and templates were designed to amplify sequences encoding a zinc finger protein for the expression of an artificial repetitive protein. the primer\u2013template mixture was precipitated from the phenol\u2013chloroform\u2013isoamyl alcohol extraction mixture and suspended in RNase-free water. the DNA concentration of the final sample used for RCA was determined using a nanoDrop 2000c (Thermo Scientific) pol Buffer (20 mM Tris\u2013HCl, 10 mM (NH4)2SO4, 10 mM KCl, 2 mM MgSO4, and 0.1% Triton X-100; NEB) was incubated in the Bst reaction buffer (8 mM Mg2+) at 60\u00b0C for 20\u201360 min. the 96\u20137 DNA polymerase (Nippon Gene) was incubated in the 96\u20137 reaction buffer (8 the temperature of the MW-RCA reaction mixture was raised from 13\u00b0C to 60\u00b0C in 2 min. the microwave applicator was unable to maintain the reaction volume at 60\u00b0C over 30 min. the average microwave output at 60\u00b0C during the 30-min incubation was 2 W. electrophoresis RCA products were electrophoresed in 1.5% agarose gels. the electrophoresis buffer contained 222 mM Tris\u2013borate buffer and 5 mM EDTA. gels were analyzed using an ultraviolet filter (605DF40, Fujifilm) Bst DNA polymerase-LF, 10\u201360-min rolling circle amplification and 10\u201330-min microwave-assisted (MW)-RCA. fluorescence intensity showed a 4-fold increase than conventional RCA in 30 min. the fluorescence intensity in MW-RCA using the 96\u20137 DNA polymerase was higher by a factor of 30 at 30 min compared with conventional RCA. MW-RCA using the 96\u20137 DNA polymerase showed diffuse migration of high molecular weight DNA molecules at 20 min. the fluorescence intensity of the conventional RCA reaction products at 90 min was twice as that of MW-RCA at 30 min. four samples (dNTPs with 46 L of RNase-free water, circularized template with primers in 50 L of RNase-free water, and 8 U of the Bst DNA polymerase in 50 L of RNase-free water) reached a maximum temperature of 42\u00b0C by microwave heating in 10 min. the temperature of 40 mM (NH4)2SO4 reached 60\u00b0C after 195 seconds and that of 40 mM KCl plateaued at 55\u00b0C. the maximum temperature of 80 mM Tris\u2013HCl was 46\u00b0C. RCA reactions containing a 4-fold excess concentration of dNTPs incubated under conventional or microwave heating did not amplify repetitive DNA. MW-RCA reaction mixtures containing template\u2013primers at a 4-fold excess concentration were most effectively replicated by the other seven sample pairs. a power profile of microwave is a value obtained by subtracting reflected power from incident power. conventional RCA and MW-RCA reactions were sampled at intervals from 10 to 60 min and 10 to 30 min respectively. the use of the microwave applicator ended in 30 min under high temperature conditions. the fluorescence intensities of the MW-RCA reaction sampled at 20 and 30 min and those of the conventional RCA reaction sampled at 60 min showed that the former plateaued at 20 min. MW-RCA using the 96\u20137 DNA polymerase was almost equal to that of conventional RCA at 60 and 90 min. dNTPs, dNTPs, ThermoPol Buffer, Bst-LF, and RNase-free water attained 60\u00b0C using a 60\u00b0C heating block. four samples reached a maximum temperature of 42\u00b0C by microwave heating in 10 min. HCl, 10 mM (NH4)2SO4, 10 mM KCl, and 2 mM MgSO4) were heated from 13\u00b0C to 60\u00b0C for 10 min. the temperature increase of 10 mM (NH4)2SO4 was the highest (47\u00b0C) the temperatures of 20 mM Tris\u2013HCl and 2 mM MgSO4 were nearly identical to the temperature of the RNase-free water. all reactions were performed for 30 min at 60\u00b0C using a thermal cycler. MW-RCA of the control and all seven types of MW-RCA reactions effectively amplified 75-bp circular templates compared with each control RCA. RCA reactions containing a 4-fold excess concentration of each RCA component were accelerated by conventional as well as microwave heating. assisted rolling circle amplification reaction mixtures containing 4-fold increased concentrations of one component. a microwave applicator avoided the problem of temperature measurement under microwave irradiation. we compared the products of MW-RCA and conventional RCA. a study using thermostable -glucosidase under microwave irradiation at frequencies of 2.45 and 5.8 GHz suggested that 5.8 GHz irradiation affected only the water molecules in the buffer solution. 2.45 GHz acted on both water molecules and buffering ions. a substantial change in concentration of the ThermoPol buffer is impossible. microwave selective heating could be observed with heating of only one of each buffer component under microwave irradiation. we prepared four samples of one-fold ThermoPol buffer components and four samples of ThermoPol buffer components in four-fold excess concentrations. temperature measurements of ThermoPol buffer components at four-fold excess concentrations showed an increase in temperature compared with one-fold concentrations. buffer solutions of (NH4)2SO4 and MgSO4 showed large temperature increases per 1 mM under microwave irradiation. this suggests a link between the amplification of MW-RCA and the temperature increase of (NH4)2SO4 and MgSO4 under microwave irradiation. d) 96\u20137 DNA polymerase, 10\u201330-min MW-RCA. d) 96\u20137 DNA polymerase, 10\u201330-min MW-RCA. temperature profiles of MW-RCA reaction mixtures from each containing a 4-fold increased concentration of each RCA component at 60\u00b0C. control_MW-RCA (b) 10 mM dNTP_MW-RCA (c) 32 U Bst DNA polymerase-LF_MW-RCA (d) 4 Template & primer_MW-RCA (e) 80 mM Tris\u2013HCl_MW-RCA (f) 40 mM KCl_MW-RCA (g S1 File shows the profiles of temperature (S1 Fig) and power (S2 Fig) to support the results of Fig 4.
