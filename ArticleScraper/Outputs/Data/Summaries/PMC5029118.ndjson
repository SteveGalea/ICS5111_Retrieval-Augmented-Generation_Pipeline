{"summary": "there is a single AP2/ERF domain in each member of the EREBP subfamily. the members of the AP2 subfamily contain two AP2/ERF domains is further classified into two monophyletic groups. there are seven conservative domains in a typical AP2 group gene. the AP2-R2 domain in these three genes is not the same as AP2, TOE3, and TOE1. the remaining five genes act redundantly as flowering repressors. mRNA abundance and translation of TOE1-2, AP2, SMZ, and SNZ in Arabidopsis are regulated by miR172. 105 spermatophyte AP2 group genes from 56 spermatophytes were examined by phylogenetic analyses. the results revealed that the AP2 group genes experienced background purifying selection throughout evolution. however, analyses also showed that the AP2 group genes have also undergone positive selection. orthologs of AP2 group genes from spermatophytes differ and can be classified into two types and six clades. it is well known that the Arabidopsis AP2 group has six members. only some species in Brassicaceae contain five or six AP2 group members. the genes AP2, TOE1, TOE2, SMZ/SNZ, and AP2L from gymnosperms are well clustered into form six independent clades. the two sub-branches of Pinaceae in the AP2L cluster c adequately reflected the duplication of AP2 genes in gymnosperms. papaya, Vitis vinifera, and Betula platyphylla with unisexual flowers formed a branch with lower bootstrap value (bootstrap value = 25) however, the branch of unisexual flower didn't appear in the TOE1 clade. there were 105 spermatophyte AP2 group genes. the first EAR domain (DLNxxP or LxLxL), NLS domain, AP2-R1 domain, linkage domain, AP2-R2 domain, miRNA172 target site are conserved in amino acid sequences. EAR domains are missing in orthologs from the Poaceae family. AP2-R2 domain was incomplete in the amino acid sequence of the TOE2 clade lacking a 15-residue insertion. the TOE2 clade has a closer phylogenetic relationship to the SMZ/SNZ clade, forming a TOE type with the TOE1 clade. 25 motifs including the AP2-R2 domain of the SMZ/SNZ clade, i.e., Motif the different clades and species could be characterized based on the distribution of motifs. each clade contained its own unique motifs: AP2 clade, Motifs 1 and 9\u201317; AP2L clade, Motif 18; TOE1 clade, Motifs 21 and 24; TOE2 clade, Motif 25; SMZ/SNZ clade, Motifs 7, 8, and 22) AP2 clade from Brassicaceae and Poaceae contain unique motifs. Motif 19 is present in clades AP2L and TOE1 but not in clade AP2. -values of >1, 1 and 1 imply positive selection, neutral evolution and purifying selection. the dN of the TOE1 clade was higher than that of the AP2 clade (Figure 3B) the dN of the TOE1 clade was higher than that of the AP2 clade (Figure 3B), implying that more amino acids changes accumulated in TOE1 during evolution. the sliding-window -tests on clades AP2, AP2L, and TOE1 showed similar curves in the different clade lineages toe1 contained more positive-selection peaks, implying that the purifying selective pressure on the TOE1 clade was relatively weak. the free-ratio model fit the data better than the one-ratio model for the protein-coding sequences from clades AP2, AP2L, and TOE1. all AP2 group genes were analyzed by the free-ratio and one-ratio models. results also suggested that varied among branches. genes of different clades experienced different selective pressures. selection models M2a and M8, respectively, identified positive selection ( > 1) at the level of posterior probability >0.99. all 9 positively selected sites detected by M8 were also identified by M2a at the level of posterior probability >0.99. negative selection was only detected in clade AP2 by the two positive selection models (M2a and M8) positive selection was only detected in clade AP2 by the two positive selection models (M2a and M8) no such positively selected sites were discovered in AP2. the positively selected sites in clade AP2 were not identified by the M3 (discrete) model because was 1, which was similar to the results for all AP2 genes. the number of positively selective sites was four and two in M2a and M8, respectively, at posterior probability >0.99. the parameters from the six models were quite similar between clades AP2L and TOE1.

AP2L and TOE1 experienced similar adaptive evolutionary processes. only one site belonging to the second category suggested that AP2 evolved faster than TOE1. a region in intron 5 of AtTOE2 was very similar to exon 6 of AtAP2, AtTOE1 and AtTOE3. a region in intron 5 of AtTOE2 was very similar to exon 6 of AtAP2, AtTOE1 and AtTOE3. this suggests that exon 6 was lost in the course of AtTOE2 evolution. pCLV3:YFPer signal was only observed in the epidermal layer of the mutant ap2 (2-132) mutant at levels comparable to wild-type. at the seedling stage, ap2 (2-132) plants failed to develop a wild-type like shoot meristem. a single-base exchange in intron 6 of AtAP2 was identified (Image 4E), which affected pre-mRNA splicing and led to loss of exon 6 of AtAP2 in 2-132. this lost exon is homologous with exon 6 of AtAP2 (Figure 6 and Image 4G) the orthologs of AP2 group genes from spermatophytes differ. all genes were categorized as two types: the AP2 type, which included the three clades TOE3, AP2-like and AP2, and the TOE1 type, which included the three clades TOE1, TOE2, SMZ/SNZ. for each ortholog, most of the sequences clustered together to form an independent clade, except in gymnosperms. in the branches of AP2 and TOE1, the phylogenetic trees are very similar to the structure of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group system. in the AP2 clade, the dicots such as Ricinus communis, Manihot esculenta, Jatropha curcas, Populus trichocarpa, Carica papaya, Vitis vinifera, and Betula platyphylla formed a branch with lower bootstrap enetic tree of every clade was shown in Image 2. the scale bar indicates the branch length that corresponds to 0.5 substitutions per site. species and accession numbers are listed in Data sheet 1. complete protein-coding genes in the AP2L clade contain two EAR motifs. the EAR domains are of two types, namely DLNxxP and LxLxL. the amino acid sequence of the first EAR domain in the AP2 type was DLNxxP. most AP2- and TOE-type proteins contained more motifs (15/25) but there was only one motif (Motif 4) in toE3 clade proteins. differences in numbers of motifs were seen mostly in one region. phylogenetic relationship between AP2 group proteins agreed with results of the phylogenetic analysis by MEGA. all sequences were from gymnosperms and contained five or six motifs. Motif 19 is specific to clades AP2 and AP2L, and clades TOE1 is also specific to clades. dN and dS values were obtained for each family (order) AP2 group genes (A) and different clades (B) the dN of the TOE1 clade was higher than that of the AP2 clade (Figure 3B) the sliding-window -tests on clades AP2, AP2L, and TOE1 showed similar curves in the different clade lineages. the peaks above the line that marks dN = dS in Figure 4 suggest the existence of positive selection, primarily on either side of the two AP2 domains. there were more dN > dS peaks in the graph of the AP2L clade because fewer AP2 ortholog sequences are available for gymnosperms. the values of for these AP2 group genes were similar (0.2083\u20130.2897) and substantially less than 1. however, the free-ratio model fit the data better than the one-ratio model for the protein-coding sequences from clades AP2, AP2L, and TOE1. genes from these three clades experienced different selective pressures. no positively selected sites were identified by the M3 model because 1, but two models (M2a and M8) allowed for positive selection. positively selected sites identified simultaneously by models M2a and M8 in Codeml were defined as positively selected. 81346.4866 0.3541 p0 = 0.4298, p1 = 0.2336 (p2 = 0.3365), 0 = 0.0223, 1 = 0.3017 2 = 0.8143 12965.9972 (P = 0.0000) Not allowed M2a (PositiveSelection) 82283.7557 0.5952 p0 = 0.5014, p1 = 0.4197 (p2 = 0.0789), 0 = 0.0594 positive selected sites identified with posterior probability p > 0.95. positive selection was only detected in clade AP2 by the two positive selection models (M2a and M8). negative selection was only detected in clade AP2 by the two positive selection models (M2a and M8). clades AP2L and TOE1 experienced similar adaptive evolutionary mechanisms. only the AP2 clade underwent positive selection. results revealing a lack of positive selection in the AP2 group genes of Brassicaceae. not allowed M8 (beta&) 30475.8695 0.2654 p0 = 0.9713 (p1 = 0.0287) 298D 303D 306A 307G p = 0.2195, q = 0.0466, = 1.5340 AP2L M0 (one-ratio) 11582.3172 0.3853 p0 = 0.2811, p1 = 0.5226 (p2 = 0.1963), 0 = 0.0063, 1 11597.7023 0.3896 p0 = 0.9625 (p1 = 0.0375) p = 0.4627, q = 0.9010, = 1.6976 3.388152 (P = 0.1838) None TOE1 M0 (one-ratio) 31052.6234 0.2710 = 0.2710 None M3 (discrete) 29048.0536 0.3427 p0 = 0.3819, p1 = 0.3179 (p2 = 0. positive selected sites in AP2 and AP2L clades were identified with posterior probability p > 0.95. certain amino acid residues in common homeodomains reflect evolutionary relationship from AP2L to AP2 and TOE1. AP2L and TOE1 experienced similar adaptive evolutionary processes. arrows marked clade-specific sites in homeodomains identified in AP2Ls, AP2s, and TOE1s sequences. alignment of AP2 group gene homolog sequences from A. thaliana demonstrated expanded mode of spermatophyte AP2 group. ap2 is involved in the regulation of the stem-cell niche in the shoot meristem. atSMZ, AtSNZ, AtTOE1, and AtTOE3 redundantly affect flowering time. gene duplication was an important cause of the expansion of the Brassicaceae AP2 group. pCLV3:YFPer signal was only observed in the epidermal layer of the mutant ap2 (2-132) mutant. at the seedling stage, ap2 (2-132) mutants failed to develop a wild-type like shoot meristem. at the seedling stage, ap2 (2-132) plants also were late flowering with abnormal flower phenotype and abnormal CLV3 expression in the stem-cell niche of shoots. a protein containing two AP2 domains has been identified in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. it does not cluster with the AP2 subfamily, though the amino acid composition of its AP2 domain is very similar to the AP2 group. AP2L from gymnosperms were identified in searching orthologs of AP2 group genes. AP2 group genes were also detected in basal angiosperms (Amborella trichopoda, AmtAP2; Gnetum parvifolium, GpTOE1; Nymphaea hybrid cultivar, NhTOE1) and respectively clustered into the AP2 and TOE-type lineages. the whole-genome duplication in ancestral angiosperms was the likely basis of AP2 group gene differentiation. the first EAR domain transformed from DLNxxP to LxLxL in the TOE type disappeared in the TOE3 clade. these changes caused AP2 and TOE1 orthologs to diverge into the AP2 and TOE types. the analysis demonstrated there are AP2 and TOE1 orthologs in most angiosperms except Brassicaceae. selective pressures analysis of all and each clade of the AP2 group genes in spermatophyte suggested that complex selective pressures drove the evolution of the AP2 group. as DNA-binding proteins containing two AP2 domains, AP2 group genes needed to maintain high conservation in the AP2 domains and NLS i.e., to facilitate nuclear translocation and DNA binding. all -values were 1 in the one-by-one comparison of AP2 AP2 clade genes retained ancestor gene function of AP2 group Phylogenetic analysis showed that all orthologs of AP2 group genes (AP2L) belong to the AP2 type and are most closely related to the AP2 clade. the ancestor of seed plants had AP2-like genes but no TOE1-like genes. overexpression of AtAP2 affects floral patterning in gymnosperms. AP2Ls are also expressed during somatic embryogenesis in gymnosperms. AP2 clades genes have been constantly evolving by structural changes. phylogenetic tree of the Brassicaceae AP2 group reflects evolutionary relationship. the TOE3 clade is a sister to the AP2 clade belonging to the AP2 type. AP2 group proteins from Arabidopsis are control factors of flowering. overexpression of AtSMZ, AtSNZ, AtTOE1 or AtTOE2 causes late flowering. quadruple (smz snz toe1 toe2) and sextuple (ap2 toe3 smz snz toe1) mutants flower earlier than any single or double mutant. mutation analysis showed changes in AP2-R1 and R2 lead to loss of stem-cell maintenance. atTOE3 and AtTOE1 do not function in stem-cell maintenance. AP2 group genes first appeared in gymnosperms and evolved into AP2 and TOE types through whole-genome and gene duplication in angiosperms. AP2 domain was previously considered a plant specific core construct of the AP2 family, but it has more recently been found in cyanobacterium, ciliates, and viruses. a protein containing two AP2 domains has been identified in physcomitrella. AP2 and EREBP subfamilies diverged before the Chlorophyta lineage diverged from the Streptophyta lineage. AP2L from gymnosperms were identified in searching orthologs of AP2 group genes. AP2L from gymnosperms were also detected in basal angiosperms. fern supports the argument that the AP2 group first appeared in gymnosperms. the whole-genome duplication in ancestral angiosperms was the likely basis of AP2 group gene differentiation. in this process, there were more new motifs in AP2-type than TOE-type genes. the AP2 group was different in AP2 domain and motifs than the ANT group. the deletion and amino acid changes mainly occurred in the TOE2 and SMZ/SNZ AP2-R2 domains but TOE3 was formed by the removal of motifs. different selective pressures drove the evolution of different clades in spermatophyte AP2 group. AP2 clade genes retained ancestor gene function of AP2 group. phylogenetic analysis showed that all orthologs of AP2L in gymnosperms belong to the AP2 type and are closely related to the AP2 clade. but some functions might be conserved in the most recent common ancestor of extant spermatophytes. expression patterns of AP2Ls in gymnosperms have been examined in previous studies. AP2Ls are expressed in female and male cones, leaves, stems and roots. AP2Ls are expressed in female and male cones, leaves, stems and roots. anum lycopersicon (Karlova et al., 2011), Solanum tuberosum (Martin et al., 2009), Actinidia deliciosa (Varkonyi-Gasic et al., 1999, 2001), and Crocus sativus (Tsaftaris et al., 1999, 2001) have been linked to AP2Ls. they function in floral organ identity and development, fruit development, single mutant and overexpression of AtTOE3 showed no visible phenotypic effects. expression pattern was different from other AP2 group genes in arabidopsis. US and CLV3 of shoot meristem stem-cell niche are regulated by AP2 and TOE3. the function of maintaining the stem-cell niche was conserved in the spermatophyte AP2 and AP2L clades. giosperm AP2 group expect Brassicaceae. current data suggested TOE2s, TOE3s, SMZs, and SNZs only exist in Brassicaceae. AP2s are the main function genes in AP2 group. phylogenetic tree of AP2 group genes was obtained by using ML (maximum likelihood) (MEGA 6.0) methods. 105 aligned AP2 group genes sequences, isolated from different clades, were selected to test whether they were under purifying selection. M1a assumes two classes of sites in proteins in proportions p0 and p1 (1\u2013p0) with 0 0 1 (purifying selection) and 1 = 1 (neutral sites) p2a adds a proportion (p2) to account for a class of sites where 2 is estimated from the data. ap2-1 and ap2-2 mutants have been described. the 2-132 mutation was mapped using plants with a wild-type-like phenotype in the pCLV3:YFPer generation. phylogenetic tree of AP2 group genes was obtained by using ML (maximum likelihood) methods. 105 aligned AP2 group genes sequences were selected to test whether they were under purifying selection. M1a assumes two classes of sites in proteins in proportions p0 and p1 (1\u2013p0) with 0 0 1 (purifying selection) and 1 = 1 (neutral sites) implemented in M2a and M8 was used to determine the positively selected sites by calculating the posterior probabilities (p) of classes for each site. the sites with high posterior probabilities (p > 0.95) coming from the class with > 1 were believed to be under positive selection. conflict of interest statement The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. image 3 phylogenetic analysis of AP2 group protein in brassicaceae. phylogenetic analysis of AP2 group protein in brassicaceae. the ML tree was constructed based on the whole protein sequences of spermatophyte AP2 Group gene using MEGA6.0 with 1000 bootstrap replications. the ML tree was constructed using the whole protein sequences of spermatophyte AP2 Group gene using MEGA6.0 with 1000 bootstrap replications. the number of rosette leaves in 2-132 homozygous mutant during flowering time is more than wild-type but the height growth is less. the number of rosette leaves in 2-132 is more than wild-type but the height growth is less."}
