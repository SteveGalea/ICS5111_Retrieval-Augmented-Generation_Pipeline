{"summary": "invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a particularly severe disease in immunocompromised patients. it is often based on a body of arguments built around host, clinical, radiological and mycological criteria. the detection of Aspergillus DNA in blood samples by real-time polymerase chain reaction has a long history of use. non-invasive aspergillosis can occur in non-immunocompromised patients. other clinical forms include chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) and allergic diseases as allergic broncho-pulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) no analyses were performed on stored sample. clinical and radiological data were collected retrospectively. we thereafter excluded from analyses patients for whom data were lacking. the final PCR result was expressed in numbers of copies per mL of sample. an internal control was used in the assay for all wells (TaqMan exogenous Internal Positive Control) as an extraction control (albumin gene) for each sample. a single positive well was considered a positive result. clinical and radiological data were collected retrospectively. we thereafter excluded from analyses patients for whom data were lacking. the study was focused on patients with proven/probable IA. the final PCR result was expressed in numbers of copies per mL of sample. an internal control was used in the assay for all wells (TaqMan exogenous Internal Positive Control) as an extraction control (albumin gene) for each sample. a p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. clinical data were available for 613 patients (785 BAL samples) clinical data were available for 613 patients (785 BAL samples) ticoid therapy and ten patients (28.6%) were neutropenic (absolute neutrophil count 500/L) at the time of diagnosis. underlying conditions were mainly solid organ transplantation (n = 12; 34.2%: heart = 6, liver = 2, kidney = 2, liver/kidney = 1), haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (n = 6; 17.1%) and hematological malignancies (n = 6; 17.1%) 1 (7.7) 1 (5.3) 0.47 1 (7.7) terminal cirrhosis (%) 2 (5.7) 0 2 (10.5) 0 Bronchopulmonary disease (%) 1 (2.9) 0 1 (5.3) 8 (61.5) ICU ECMO (%) 5 (14.3) 2 (15.4) 3 (15.8) 0 Neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count 500/L) 10 (28.6) 4 (30.8) 5 (26.3) 1 0 Corticosteroid therapy ( performance of the Galactomannan Index, mycological examination and PCR on BAL for the Diagnosis of Invasive Aspergillosis Proven/probable invasive aspergillosis was diagnosed in 35 patients. PCR was positive in 31 of these 35 patients, but the three methods were performed on a same BAL sample for 32 patients. bMycological examination (\u2018mycology\u2019 in the table) included microscopic analysis and a 28-day Sabouraud agar culture of respiratory samples. sensitivity for PCR, the GM index and BAL mycological examination of 87% (95% CI, 75.2\u201398.8%), 62% (95% CI, 44\u201380%) and 70% (95% CI, 53\u201387%). index and mycology examination were 95.5% (95% CI, 93.8\u201397.2%), 97.6% (95% CI, 96.3\u201398.9%) and 94.5% (95% CI, 92.6\u201396.4%), respectively. decreasing the GM index positivity cut-off led to an increased sensitivity (68.7% [95% CI, 52.6\u201384.8%]), but still lower than PCR (p = 0.04). non-neutropenic patients' specificities were 94.1% (n = 16/17), 100% (n = 17/17) and 100% (17/17) in neutropenic patients and 95.5% (n = 536/561), 97.5% (n = 514/527) and 94.3% (515/546) in non-neutropenic patients, respectively. sensitivity of PCR (76.9% CI, 54\u201399.8%) was considerably superior to that of the GM index the three methods provided a high NPV (between 95.4 and 99.6%), whatever the clinical form of aspergillosis. 17 patients were free from antifungal therapy at the time the BAL was sampled. 18 others patients were receiving an antifungal treatment. real-time PCR can quantify fungal load, with results expressed as the number of Aspergillus gene copies per mL of BAL. results suggest that fungal load might be useful to discriminate between aspergillosis and contamination/clinically irrelevant colonization. p 0.005 by t-test; p 0.0005 by t-test. Error bars represent mean and standard deviation. a cut-off of 500 copies/mL was the optimal threshold. aspergillus PCR performed in BAL is highly predictive of 90-day mortality in invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. patients with initial fungal loads below 1.5 (n = 15; 80% survival) have more favorable outcomes than other patients (n = 19; 31.6% survival) the overall, invasive and chronic aspergillosis incidences were respectively 7.8, 5.7, and 2.1% over the study period. the overall, invasive and chronic aspergillosis incidences were respectively 7.8, 5.7, and 2.1% over the study period. the overall 3-month mortality of invasive aspergillosis was 54.3% (19/35). invasive aspergillosis Non-invasive aspergillosis All (n = 35) A. fumigatus IPA (n = 32) 500 copies/ml 500 copies/ml 500 copies/ml p Patients (n) 35 13 19 13 Median age (years) 59 57 54 0.8 63 Sex ratio (Male/Female) 23/12 10/3 10/9 0.27 10/3 Underlying disease Hematological malignancy (%) clinical forms were CPA for 9 patients (69.2%), including chronic cavitary pulmonary aspergillosis (n = 5; 38.5%), aspergilloma (n = 3; 23.1%) and chronic necrotising pulmonary aspergillosis (n = 1; 7.7%). three-month mortality was 7.7% (1/13), a rate significantly lower than that of invasive forms (p 0.01 by Fisher\u2019s exact test). in 19/31 of these IA patients (sensitivity of 61%). diagram shows data for patients for whom PCR products, galactomannan and mycological analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were available on a same sample. two patients, all tests were negative. bMycological examination (\u2018mycology\u2019 in the table) included microscopic analysis and a 28-day Sabouraud agar culture of respiratory samples. sensitivity for BAL PCR, BAL GM index and BAL mycological examination were 87% (95% CI, 75.2\u201398.8%), 62% (95% CI, 44\u201380%) and 70% (95% CI, 53\u201387%) PCR was the only positive test in BAL for 6 IA patients, whereas it was never the case for GM and mycological examination. excluding PCR from the combination led to a decreased sensitivity (Figure 2). Neutropenic Versus Non-neutropenic No statistically significant differences were observed between neutropenic and non-neutropenic patients. PCR yielded 54.4% PPV (95% CI, 41.5\u201367.3%) and 99.3% negative predictive value (NPV) GM index yielded 58.1% PPV (95% CI, 40.7\u201375.5%) and 97.4% NPV (95% CI, 96.1\u201398.7%) PCR sensitivity in BAL was not different between the groups. 88.2% (15/17) for non-treated group and 88.9% (16/18) for patients under antifungal treatment (p = 1). the only parameter affected between patients with and without a previous mold-active antifungal therapy, was the BAL culture. fungal load assessed by Aspergillus PCR in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid can discriminate between aspergillosis and contamination/clinically irrelevant colonization. patients with either invasive or chronic forms of aspergillosis had higher Aspergillus copy numbers compared to patients for whom aspergillosis was excluded. the test had a hazard ratio of 0.23 (95% CI of ratio: 0.08\u20130.65). the characteristics of the patients (i.e., age, sex ratio, underlying diseases or antifungal therapy) as well as the interval between sampling and the start of targeted antifungal therapy were not different between these two groups. GM index in BAL supernatant also permitted this kind of discrimination with a 1.5 index cut-off. aspergillus DNA detection for the diagnosis of aspergillosis has been the subject of studies for more than 20 years. many authors, having demonstrated sensitivities ranging from 72 to 88% and specificities from 75 to 98.7%, are now stating that aspergillus PCR in blood is an interesting tool for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis. the rate for sensitivity observed for PCR in BAL was superior to those observed for the GM index whatever the cut-off used (0.5 or 1). sensitivity was 96.9% when the analysis was limited to cases of invasive aspergillosis with pulmonary involvement and A. fumigatus as the causative species. fungal load can distinguish between aspergillosis and non-aspergillosis pathologies. this finding was not surprising as both invasive and chronic pathologies may involve a high fungal burden. bronchoalveolar lavage is an endoscopic procedure. the PCR we use is specific to the A. fumigatus species and thus cannot amplify the genomes of other important species such as A. flavus, or A. niger. only one case of non-fumigatus (A. nidulans) diagnosed in our series. in cases of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, a threshold of 500 copies/mL is useful to discriminate between aspergillosis and contamination or clinically irrelevant colonization. this cut-off might be used on one hand to identify patients needing particularly intensive care and on the other to design further clinical studies."}
