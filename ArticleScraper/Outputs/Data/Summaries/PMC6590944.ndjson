{"summary": "the pathophysiology of bipolar 1 disorder (B1D) is of great interest to researchers. pro-inflammatory biomarkers and specific gene expression play pivotal roles in B1D development, and IFN- has emerged as an important inflammatory marker. 0.5% of total proportion of disability adjusted life years (DALYs) is related to B1D. the pathophysiology and treatment of B1D are of great interest to researchers. previous studies illustrated biological aspects including immune dysregulation, inflammation, and genetic factors. a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the first intron of the human IFN- gene is associated with several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. the T allele is seen in high, while the A allele is seen in low, plasma IFN-. one hundred and six randomly-selected ethnic Iranian euthyroid BID patients aged 18-70 and 109 Iranian healthy control subjects were enrolled in the study. the inclusion criteria were: age 18-70, negative medical history of psychotic or mood disorders, thyroid dysfunction, or autoimmune disease. the internal control and primer sequences were verified by primer blast program. the polymorphisms, product sizes, and primer sequences were detected with gene runner software. the amplification refractory mutation system\u2013polymerase chain reaction was performed as follows. the amplified products were electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. the presence of a control band with an allele-specific band indicated the absence of that allele. the results were analyzed by descriptive statistics, logistic regression test, independent sample t-test, one-way ANOVA, and one-way ANOVA. overdominant inheritance model analysis indicated that T/A genotype patients were at a lower risk than T/T-A/A patients for B1D compared with controls. however, no significant difference in allele distribution was found between the two groups (P = 0.25) patients N=106 (%) P value Odds ratio (95% CI) Codominant T/T 23 (21.7%) 6 (5.5%) 0.0006 1.0 (reference) T/A 67 (63.2%) 92 (84.4%) 0.19 (0.07-0.49) A/A 16 (15.1%) 11 (10.1%) 0.38 (0.12-1.24) Dominant T/T 23 (21.7%) 6 (5.5%) 0.0005 1.0 (reference) T/A-A/A 74 positive patient\u2019s history of suicide 74 (69.8%) 17 (23%) 47 (63.5%) 10 (13.5%) Negative patient\u2019s history of psychosis 18(17%) 2 (11.1%) 13 (72.2%) 3 (16.7%) 0.48 Positive patient\u2019s history of psychosis 88 (83%) 21 (23.9%) 54 (61.4%) 13 (14.8%) Discussion Due to the cognitive impairment and social and financial consequences caused by B1D. IFN- activates and induces MHC expression in microglial cells and macrophages, release of TNF- and IL-1 from macrophages, and stimulates leukocyte adhesion (27). IFN- also has a regulatory T cell function that can be used to treat GBS (28). a study of chronic hepatitis patients reported that those with the IFN- +874 T/A polymorphism T allele had higher cirrhosis rates than healthy controls. a case-control study of IFN- +874 T/A polymorphisms reported that IFN- SNPs and their haplotypes are associated with pneumonia-induced sepsis. different loci."}
