HCV assays HCV infection was documented in all patients by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and PCR test. the most common SNPs in Mx1 gene (chromosome 21) and OAS1-3 genes (chromosome 12) were selected using the databases of HapMap Project (http://snp.cshl.org/cgi-perl/gbrowse/hapmap_B35/) and NCBI (dbSNP) the selection criteria were: (i) SNPs located in putative regulatory regions, or splicing control elements (SCE), or missense variant pairwise linkage disequilibrium patterns for genetic polymorphisms of MX1 and OAS1-3 were discarded for the analysis of individual association. each diagonal represents a different SNP, with each square representing a pairwise comparison between two SNPs. each logistic regression test was only adjusted by the most significant co-variables associated with each outcome variables. the covariables used were gender, age, alcohol intake at biopsy study, BMI, HOMA, nadir CD4+ T-cells, AIDS, undetectable HIV-RNA (50 copies/ml), CD4+ T-cells, time on cART, type of cART, HCV-RNA 500,000 IU/ml, time of HCV infection, study population We performed cross-sectional study in 219 HIV/HCV-coinfected patients that underwent a liver biopsy between September 2000 and November 2008. patients gave their written consent for the study. the duration of HCV infection for patients with a history of intravenous drug use was estimated starting from the first year they shared needles and other injection paraphernalia. there was no patient with HCV viral loads below the limit of detection. UI/ml was chosen as cutoff for low vs. high viral load (circulating HCV RNA)30,31. the samples were always evaluated by the same pathologist, who was unaware of the patients\u2019 clinical or laboratory data. intron 2, OAS3 rs739903 in 3\u2032UTR, OAS3 rs2285933 in exon 6 (missense), and OAS3 rs2010604 in 3\u2032UTR. five polymorphisms were selected as tagSNPs according to linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns for genetic polymorphisms of MX1 and OAS1-3. we select the IBS (Iberian populations in Spain) population that included 107 individuals. primary outcome variables were related to severity of liver disease: significant fibrosis (F 2) and moderate activity grade (A 2). these analyses were tested according to the goodness of fit evaluated by Akaike information criterion (AIC) value and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) these analyses were performed by using the IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 21.0. jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations."}
