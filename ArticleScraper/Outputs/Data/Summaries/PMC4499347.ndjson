{"summary": "monoclonal gastric cancer 7 antigen (MG7-Ag) is a tumor-associated antigen with high specificity and selectivity. MG7-Ag expression in gastric mucosa is closely associated with high risk of gastric atypical hyperplasia and malignant change. the classic TLR7 agonist has also been reported with immunostimulatory capacity. it lacks the chemical group to couple with proteins or peptides. we adopted another well-studied TLR7 agonist (T7; chemical structure is shown in Figure 1). 2-Chlorotrityl chloride resin (GL BIO Company, Shanghai, China) was the solid support loaded at 1.0 mmol/g. the following N-protected Fmoc amino acids were applied as the functionalized amino acids. BMDCs and lymphocytes were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 5 104 cells per well. a cytokine quantification of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-, interferon (IFN)-, and IL-12 p70 ELISA Ready-SET-Go reagent sets were performed. female 4-wk-old BALB/c mice weighing 15-20 g were purchased from the medical laboratory animal center. mice were housed in constant laboratory conditions of a 12 h light/dark cycle and specific pathogen-free conditions. each mouse was subcutaneously challenged with 1 107 Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC cells) ELISA plate coated with BSA-MG1 (peptide sequence is BSA-KPHVHTK) overnight at 4 \u00b0C, then incubated successively with block solution for 2 h, serum samples (1:50 diluted), and detection antibody for 1 h at room temperature. p-NPP substrate and stop solution were added to each well, and the optical density was measured at 405 nm with a spectrophotometer. peptides were synthesized by solid phase using an Fmoc strategy. the peptides were synthesized by solid phase using an Fmoc strategy. peptides were dissolved with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water/acetonitrile and lyophilized. electrospray mass spectrometry was performed to further identify the peptides. BMDCs and lymphocytes were seeded in 96-well plates. female 4-wk-old BALB/c mice weighing 15-20 g were purchased from the Medical Laboratory Animal Center (Guangzhou, Guangdong, China) each mouse was subcutaneously challenged with 1 107 Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC cells) antibody titers in serum were determined by ELISA using an alkaline phosphate-conjugated detection antibody for total IgG. blood samples were collected from the mice and centrifuged at 3000 g for 15 min to obtain serum samples. eAC tumor cells were used as target cells and incubated with lymphocytes for 4 h at an effector-to-target cell ratio of 100:1. the difference was considered statistically significant at P 0.05. BMDCs and spleen lymphocytes were exposed to vaccines at indicated concentrations. the levels of two cytokines (TNF- and IL-12) remained unchanged when the BMDCs were incubated with MG1 or MG3 alone. however, T7 displayed dose-dependent increases of TNF- release in the range of 0.1 mol/L to 10 mol/L. MG3: Monoclonal gastric cancer 7 antigen mono-epitope; MG3: Monoclonal gastric cancer 7 antigen tri-epitope; T7: Toll-like receptor-7 agonist. protection of vaccines against tumor challenge EAC cells were used to challenge the mice to investigate the protective ability of tumor vaccines. serum antibody induced by vaccines Serum antibody titers against MG7-Ag were determined by ELISA assay. six or nine weeks after first immunization, MG7-Ag antibody increased significantly in T7+MG3 and T7-MG3 groups compared to PBS control. on the other hand, T7, MG1 or MG3 alone exerted little impact on MG7-Ag antibody. antisera obtained by immunization with MG3 showed stronger cytotoxicity. however, antisera obtained by immunization with T7+MG3 and T7-MG3 did not induce more CTL in BALB/c mice than in PBS control. no remarkable ADCC effect was found when mouse breast cancer 4T1 cells were used as target cells for negative control. no CTL effect of vaccines was detected with 4T1 cells as negative control. lymphocytes were separated from the spleens of mice immunized with vaccines. T7-Ag epitope was conjugated to T7 (T7-MG1 or T7-MG3). 0.1 mol/L T7-MG3, rather than 0.1 mol/L T7-MG1, increased levels of IFN- and IL-12. similar results were demonstrated for cytokines released in lymphocytes. protection of vaccines against tumor challenge EAC cells was used to challenge the BALB/c mice to investigate the protective ability of tumor vaccines. we also confirmed the expression of MG7-Ag in EAC cells by Western blot. serum antibody induced by vaccines Serum antibody titers against MG7-Ag were determined by ELISA assay. six or nine weeks after first immunization, MG7-Ag antibody increased significantly in T7+MG3 and T7-MG3 groups compared to PBS control. difference of immune effect was negligible between chemical conjugation (T7-MG3) and simple commixture (T7+MG3). antisera obtained by immunization with T7+MG3 and T7-MG3 were able to markedly increase cell lysis compared to PBS or MG3 alone. no remarkable ADCC effect of vaccines was found when mouse breast cancer 4T1 cells were used as target cells for negative control. Vaccines induced antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. effect of vaccines was detected with 4T1 cells as negative control. cytotoxic T lymphocyte activities were indicated by lysis of Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) cells using the lactate dehydrogenase method. data are presented as mean SE (n = 5); bP 0.01 vs control group; cP 0.05 vs T7+MG3 group. MG7-Ag is one kind of gastric cancer-associated antigen. it is expressed at a high level in the serum and tissue of gastric cancer patients. a fusion protein containing MG7-Ag antibody and superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin B has been constructed with the ability to kill human gastric cancer cells. MG7-Ag mono-epitope and tri-epitope peptides were used as antigens and expected to achieve specific antitumor effect. neither MG1 nor MG3 alone had much impact on immunity enhancement of BALB/c mice, displayed as a minimal change of antibody titers, ADCC, CTL (in vivo) and cytokine induction (in vitro) cellular immunity made a greater contribution than humoral immunity to the vaccination of T7-MG3. no significant effect of T7+MG1 or T7-MG1 was observed on either the promotion of immunity or the reduction of tumor. effective tumor vaccine targeting MG7-Ag has been constructed by chemical conjugation of T7 with MG3. it could elicit nonspecific antitumor responses and strengthen the specific humoral and cellular immune responses. this concept of vaccine construction can be further applied in other types of tumors, either as single immunotherapy or combined with other therapies. the applications of toll-like receptor (TLR) ligand as an adjuvant in vaccine development are under intensive investigation. the authors constructed tumor vaccines by covalent attachment of MG7-Ag and a TLR7 agonist (T7). a simple commixture of T7 and MG3 inhibited tumor growth in tumor-bearing mice because of the immune enhancement. study aims to develop a vaccine against gastric cancer by conjugating multi-repeat epitopes of gastric cancer antigen MG7-Ag and a TLR7 agonist. authors demonstrate that this conjugate elicits specific humoral, natural killer, and cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses in mice. MG7-Ag tri-epitope (T7-MG3) significantly increased the release of tumor necrosis factor- and interleukin (IL)-12 in bone marrow dendritic cells and interferon- and IL-12 in mouse lymphocytes in vitro. a simple commixture of T7 and MG3 was able to inhibit tumor growth in tumor-bearing mice because of the immune enhancement. but the effects of T7-MG3 were greater this conjugate elicits specific humoral, natural killer, and cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses in mice. this paper is clearly presented and is of potential interest and clinical relevance."}
