{"summary": "since the first outbreak of H5N1 in Hong Kong,1 the virus has spread to the Middle East, Africa and Europe. from January 2003 to March 2015, a total of 784 H5N1-infected human cases with 429 deaths were reported to the WHO. the four fragments were constructed by fusing HA1 fragment with Fd and Fc. IL2ss induces expressed proteins to culture supernatants. vaccines immunized through the intranasal pathway are expected to induce strong local and mucosal immune responses. recombinant proteins containing HA1 of H5N1 fused with Fc with or without Fd induced neutralizing antibodies via traditional subcutaneous route. recombinant proteins expressing HA1 of H5N1 fused with Fc with or without Fd (HA1-Fd, HA1-His) induced neutralizing antibodies via traditional subcutaneous route. HA1 of A/Anhui/1/2005(H5N1) (AH/1) was fused with foldon (HA1-Fd), human IgG1 Fc (HA1-Fc), foldon and Fc (HA1-FdFc) to form the recombinant vaccine candidates. all 4 recombinant proteins were expressed in the culture supernatant of transfected 293T cells, followed by purification of the proteins using protein A columns. mice were immunized 10 days post-last vaccination to detect HA1-specific IgG by ELISA. HA1-FdFc, HA1-Fc and HA1-Fd proteins induced stronger HA1-specific IgG antibody response than HA1-His protein. significant differences were observed between poly(I:C) and CpG groups for HA1-Fc. mouse sera and lung wash were collected to detect IgG, IgA, and neutralizing antibodies. ELISA plates were coated with HA1-FdFc, HA1-Fc, HA1-Fd, or HA1-His protein, respectively (A), or full-length HA1-His protein (B) no IgG1 or IgG2a antibody response was found in mouse sera of PBS control. ability of IgG1 (A) and IgG2a (B) antibodies to bind H5N1 HA1 protein was detected using sera from 10 days post-last vaccination. HA1-Fc, HA1-FdFc and HA1-Fd induced strong HA1-specific IgA antibody response in lung wash and sera. compared with other proteins, HA1-FdFc alone without adjuvants was able to induce IgA antibody response in both lung wash and sera. the ability of IgA to bind H5N1 HA1 protein was detected using mouse lung wash (A) and sera (B) from 10 days post-last vaccination. intranasal immunization of H5N1 HA1 proteins fused with Fc and/or Fd induced strong neutralizing antibodies. no neutralizing activity was detected in the PBS control group. the results showed the ability of HA1 fusion proteins to induce strong neutralizing antibodies through the intranasal pathway. the molecular weight of the major band of the nonboiled HA1-Fd is about 3-fold higher than that of the major band of boiled sample. however, both the nonboiled and boiled HA1-His protein remained in monomeric form. the results confirm that the purified HA1s fused with Fc maintain dimeric or trimeric structures. significant differences were observed between poly(I:C) and CpG groups for HA1-Fc. HA1-FdFc protein was still able to elicit stronger IgG antibody response. no IgG antibody response was detectable in mouse sera of PBS control. IgG1 and IgG2a subtypes induced by HA1 fusion proteins were investigated in the mouse sera collected at 10 days post-last vaccination. HA1-FdFc, HA1-Fc and HA1-Fd elicited similarly high levels of HA1-specific IgG1. h5N1 HA1 protein plus Fc and Fd has adjuvanticity in inducing humoral immune responses. HA1 fusion proteins fused with Fc and/or Fd induced strong mucosal immune responses in immunized mice. compared with other proteins, HA1-FdFc alone without adjuvants was able to induce IgA antibody response in both lung wash and sera. IgA antibody was detected by HA1-Fc, HA1-Fd and HA1-His proteins without adjuvants. mucosal adjuvants Poly(I:C) and CpG play an important role in inducing mucosal IgA antibody responses. HA1-FdFc alone without adjuvant showed 72% inhibitory activity in lung wash. the rate of inhibition induced by HA1-Fd plus Poly(I:C) was 84% in lung wash. proteins plus Poly(I:C) adjuvants induced a significantly higher level of neutralizing antibodies than proteins without adjuvants. recombinant protein-based subunit vaccines are considered safer than other vaccine types, such as inactivated virus-based vaccine, VLP-based vaccine and viral vector-based vaccine. as a mucosal pathogen, influenza virus infects humans mainly through the mucosal route. studies have also demonstrated that poly(I:C) and CpG enhanced mucosal and humoral immune responses in vaccinated mice. this study aimed to investigate the possibility of inducing mucosal immunity using recombinant Fc- and Fd-fused full-length H5N1 HA1 proteins. d and Fc without adjuvant showed inhibitory activity in these samples, suggesting that HA1-FdFc itself has adjuvanticity. this study identified promising recombinant H5N1 mucosal subunit vaccines, demonstrated their ability to induce strong local mucosal and humoral immune responses. it also proved the importance of mucosal adjuvants in the promotion of the aforementioned immune responses. a 6 Histidine tag was added at the C-termini of HA1 (HA1-His) for easy purification of the proteins. the amplified gene fragments were digested and inserted into the pFUSE-hIgG1-Fc2 expression vector. recombinant plasmids were transfected into 293T cells using the calcium phosphate method. mice were i.n. immunized with the aforementioned HA1 proteins for 3 times at 3-week intervals (10 g/200 l/mouse) mice were i.n. injected with the same amount of PBS with or without Poly(I:C) and CpG, respectively. lung wash was collected to detect IgA and neutralizing antibodies. 293T cells were cotransfected with a plasmid encoding Env-defective, luciferase-expressing HIV-1 genome (pNL4-3.luc.RE) and the plasmid encoding HA of homologous AH/1 (AH-HA) supernatants were harvested 72 h post-transfection for single-cycle infection. genes encoding full-length HA1 containing residues 13-325 of A/Anhui/1/2005(H5N1)(AH/1) were amplified by PCR using a recombinant HA1 plasmid fused with Fd and human IgG1 Fc (HA1-FdFc) as the template. a 6 Histidine (His) tag was added at the C-termini of HA1 (HA1-His the blots were incubated with HA-7 mAb (1:3,000)16 for 1 h at room temperature. signals were visualized with ECL Western blot substrate reagents. mice were i.n. immunized with the aforementioned HA1 proteins for 3 times at 3-week intervals (10 g/200 l/mouse) anti-mouse IgG (1:2,000, Invitrogen), anti-mouse IgG2a (1:2,000, Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX), anti-mouse IgG2a (1:2,000, Invitrogen) at 37\u00b0C for 1 h for 1 h. reaction was visualized by substrate 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) and stopped by 1 N H2SO4. neutralizing antibody was calculated and presented as percentages of inhibition of virus infection Disclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest The authors declared no conflict of interest."}
