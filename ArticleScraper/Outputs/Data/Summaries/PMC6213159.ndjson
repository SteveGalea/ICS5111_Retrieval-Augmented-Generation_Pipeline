{"summary": "Zika virus is a positive strand RNA ((+)RNA) virus belonging to a group of mosquito-borne flaviviruses that includes dengue viruses, west Nile virus, yellow fever virus, Japanese encephalitis virus and a growing number of other less-known viruses. the virus emerged in the spotlight after major outbreaks in the south Pacific in 2007, 2013\u20132014 and the most recent one in Brazil and other South American countries. the areas where Zika virus co-circulates with dengue viruses since cross-reactivity of dengue and Zika virus antibodies has been demonstrated in cell culture and animal studies to lead to antibody-dependent mutual enhancement of infection. rapidly replicating (+)RNA viruses, including mosquito-borne flaviviruses, are notorious for their ability to develop resistance to compounds targeting viral proteins. the detailed understanding of the involvement of cellular secretory machinery in Zika (and related flaviviruses)-infected cells could open novel avenues for the development of better infection control strategies. the detailed understanding of this critical virus-cell interaction could open novel avenues for the development of better infection control strategies. se Dengue 2, 4, West Nile, Zika Involved in maintaining the tubular dynamic structure of the ER Required for the formation of viral vesicle packets Calreticulin Calnexin GRP78 Multiple flaviviruses ER lumen chaperones involved in protein folding Facilitate proper folding of viral proteins. RNA stability or translation SPCA1 Dengue 2, West Nile, Zika TGN localized calcium transporter that regulates the activity of furin Necessary for maturation of viral glycoproteins. the nascent polyprotein contains an ER-localization signal that promotes rapid association of ribosomes translating the viral RNA with the ER membranes. cytoplasmic side of the ER with several transmembrane sequences present in NS2A, NS2B and NS4B traversing the ER membrane bilayer. red triangles designate cleavages performed by the viral protease complex NS2B-NS3 on the cytoplasmic side of the ER. brown triangles indicate cleavages performed by cellular proteases inside the ER lumen; green star shows final maturation secretory pathway operates in all eukaryotic cells and is an essential housekeeping process facilitated by a set of highly conserved molecules. in multicellular organisms the secretory pathway is further specialized to perform cell-specific functions and the adaptation to transport specific cargos are significantly different among different cell types. the human genome encodes several orthologs of yeast proteins, specialized for handling different types of cargos. secretory cargos are synthesized in the ribosome-studded ER, exit the ER at ERES in COPII-coated (brown) vesicles. transport to the PM is mediated by transport tubules. the Golgi is a stack of membranous cisternae arranged in a cis, medial and trans orientation, with the cis side facing the ER and the trans side facing the plasma membrane. two models have been proposed for the movement of cargo proteins through the Golgi stack. one states that the proteins are transferred between the cisternae via vesicles, similar to the trafficking between the ER and the ERGIC. EM images of Zika-infected cells reveal infection-specific modifications of the ER membranes. the ER architecture likely disturb normal balance of secretory trafficking factors. the RNA translation and initial polyprotein processing are believed to be associated with so-called convoluted membranes (CM) individual replication invaginations are often clustered together to form vesicle packets. formation and morphology depends on recruitment of a cellular protein reticulon 3.1A. expression of only the viral integral membrane protein NS4A is sufficient to induce invaginations morphologically similar to those observed in infected cells. virion formation sites have capsid protein C associated with the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane and viral surface glycoproteins prM and E lining the luminal side of the ER membrane. the correct folding of the flavivirus glycoproteins appears to be facilitated by the host chaperones such as calreticulin, calnexin and GRP78. ESCRT-0 recognizes ubiquitylated proteins; ESCRT-I, ESCRT-I and ALIX play roles in the concentration of the proteins into a \u201cpatch\u201d and the deformation of membranes by inducing inward curvature. ESCRT-III constitutes the fission machinery necessary to release the nascent vesicle into the endosomal lumen. CREB3L1-mediated upregulation of specific transport factors could be important for the adaptation of the secretory pathway in infected cells to facilitate virion trafficking. virions accumulated within the ER lumen expected to engage the cellular secretory machinery to be delivered to the next secretory compartment. the formation of COPII vesicles is initiated by the association of an activated (GTP-bound) form of a small GTPase Sar1 with ERES membranes. the formation of COPII vesicles is initiated by the association of an activated (GTP-bound) form of a small GTPase Sar1 with the ERES membranes. all signals responsible for flavivirus virion interaction with the cellular secretory machinery are localized in the prM-E region of the polyprotein. mutations in the non-structural protein NS2 of west Nile and yellow fever virus were shown to affect assembly and secretion of infectious virions but not empty virus-like particles containing prM-E. the interaction of deNV 1\u20133 prM with KDELRs is mediated by three, positively charged, N-terminal amino acids on prM, H2, R19 and K21. this interaction is mediated by three, positively charged, N-terminal amino acids on prM, H2, R19 and K21. this role for KDELRs is significantly different from its function in non-infected cells. the formation of these modified COPII structures requires the expression of specific isoforms of the GTPase Sar1 and the cargo-interacting Sec24. cTAGE5 is a transmembrane protein that acts as a receptor for specific large cargo molecules, like collagen fibrils. cTAGE5 is a TANGO1 homologue that is also anchored in the ER membrane. the expression of cTAGE, TANGO1, Sar1b and the Sec24d isoform in cells secreting large cargos is under CREB3L1 transcriptional control. these large cargo-specialized factors are also upregulated in flavivirus-infected cells. however, in EM images of infected cells, the well-defined stacks of the Golgi cisternae are no longer detectable. cells infected with diverse arthropod-borne flaviviruses are known to secrete virions containing both furin-cleaved and non-cleaved prM glycoproteins. the level of prM maturation determines such important parameters of infection as virion interaction with antibodies and infectivity. the redistribution of the Golgi enzymatic machinery to the ER-derived compartments containing clusters of virions may account for the generation of GBF1-activated Arfs recruit the COPI coatomer complex to initiate COPI vesicle formation for Golgi-to-ER recycling (Figure 2). Several studies have identified GBF1 as an important cellular factor for Zika virus infection. inhibition of flavivirus replication requires much higher concentrations of GBF1 inhibitors BFA and GCA than those sufficient to block the functioning of the secretory pathway in uninfected cells. a significant portion of flavivirus virions is delivered to the plasma membrane via GBF1-requiring but COPI-independent secretory mechanisms [44,86,87,107]. this may suggest that GBF1 is involved in the early steps of virion assembly by regulating the availability of the capsid protein but also may support Zika RNA replication directly, as has been described for many diverse (+)RNA viruses. large vesicles would be expected to have ER-Golgi membranes around them. they would originate from a common compartment after the virus-induced redistribution of Golgi proteins to the replication membranes. virions accumulate in the ER-Golgi hybrid compartment where viral surface glycoproteins undergo final glycosylation and proteolytic maturation. the majority of virions secreted via fusion of large versus small vesicles with the plasma membrane should undergo repackaging into individual membranous carriers. the mechanism of such repackaging is unknown but may be related to the trans-Golgi-dependent generation of secretory granules operating in some specialized cell types. this pattern is highly reminiscent of massive discharge of secretory granules. expression of another EXOCYST component, EXO70, has been shown to increase from 18 h post infection with dengue virus. inhibition of EXOCYST function reduced virion secretion, but the reduction never reached more than 75%. the suboptimal virion secretion at the mammalian body temperature could be a consequence of infection-induced alterations of the cellular secretory machinery. infected skin fibroblasts and keratinocytes would traffic Zika virions differently than infected monocytes used by the virus to build viremia. so, virion release pathways in distinct cell types may have distinct bottlenecks and vulnerable points."}
