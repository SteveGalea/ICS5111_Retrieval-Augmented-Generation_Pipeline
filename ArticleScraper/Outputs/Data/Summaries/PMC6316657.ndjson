{"summary": "despite the global burden from RSV infection, there are no available RSV-specific vaccines or effective therapeutic agents at present. the cellular innate immune system utilizes various sensors including Retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I) and Toll-like receptors (TLR3) to detect viral infection and activate antiviral immune signaling pathways. several viral proteins target TRIM25 to evade RIG-I-mediated antiviral responses. NS1 of influenza A virus interacts with TRIM25 to inhibit its oligomerization and subsequent RIG-I ubiquitination. NS1 protein is also known to co-localize with MAVS, suggesting its role in suppressing antiviral responses. pEBG-GST-RIG-IN (N-terminal 2 Cards domain of RIG-I), pEF-IRES (pIRES)-V5-TRIM25 and MAVS-CARD-proline rich domain (PRD)-FLAG were described in a previous study. the total plasmid content for each sample condition was adjusted using the empty vector. co-IP and GST-Pulldown assay Cells were collected and lysed in triton X-100 cell lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 5mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100) tagged fusion proteins, the cell lysates were incubated with glutathione-conjugated beads (Sigma) at RT for 1\u20132 h. target proteins on the gel were transferred to a PVDF membrane. the membrane was incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C with the indicated antibody in 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA, RMBio, Missoula, MT, USA) transfected HEK293T cells were lysed in passive lysis buffer. cell lysates were then analyzed by a dual-luciferase assay. cDNAs were generated from RNAs (1 g) using superscript III reverse transcriptase and oligo20(dT) primers. cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged RSV NS1 and V5-tagged TRIM25. cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde followed by blocking and permeabilization in permeabilization buffer at RT in 5 min. cells were extensively washed and incubated with FITC- and PE-labeled secondary antibodies at RT for 2 h. pEBG-GST-RIG-IN (N-terminal 2 Cards domain of RIG-I), pEF-IRES (pIRES)-V5-TRIM25 and MAVS-CARD-proline rich domain (PRD)-FLAG were described in a previous study [20]. pIRES-V5 -RING, pIRES-V5-B-box/CCD, pIRES-V5-SPRY and pIRES lysates were incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C with the indicated antibody. protein A/G resin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) was added to samples and further incubated for 2 h. anti-V5 rabbit antibody (Cell signaling, Denvers, MA, USA, #13202), anti-V5 mouse antibody (E-bioscience, San Diego, CA, USA, #14-6796-80), anti-HA mouse antibody (SantaCruz, Santa Cruz, CA, USA, #sc-7392), anti-FLAG mouse antibody (Sigma, #F7425), anti-ubiquitin (P4D1) mouse antibody (Cell signaling, #3936) real-time PCR was conducted using synthesized cDNA (2 L) the mRNA levels of interferon- and interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) were determined using the following primers and normalized to those of -actin. cells were seeded onto fibronectin coated coverslips in a 24-well plate. after 24 h, cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged RSV NS1 and V5-tagged TRIM25 and a value of p 0.05 was considered to be significant. NS1 inhibited interferon- promoter activity that was induced by NS1. similar results were obtained from experimental settings. luciferase reporter plasmids were transfected with RIG-IN together with increasing amounts of NS1 (63 and 250 ng/well) total RNAs were prepared 24 h after transfection and subjected to RT-qPCR to determine mRNA levels of IFN- and ISG15. NS1 is capable of interfering with TRIM25-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination. hek293T cells were transfected with vector (pEBG-GST; 7 g/dish) or GST-RIG-I-2Cards (GST-RIG-IN; 10 g/dish) and incubated for 24 h. interaction between TRIM25 and NS1 was investigated. however, we could not detect any interaction. NS1 targets TRIM25 to suppress RIG-I ubiquitination. whole cell lysates were subjected to co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) and immunoblotting using indicated antibodies. HEK293T cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged NS1 and V5-tagged TRIM25 expression plasmids. TRIM25 truncated mutants including V5-tagged RING, B-box/CCD and SPRY domain constructs were expressed in HEK293T cells together interaction between FLAG-tagged MAVS-CARD-PRD and GST-tagged RIG-IN was detected by co-IP. however, RSV infection resulted in decrease of both RIG-IN ubiquitination and the subsequent RIG-I interaction with MAVS. the effect of NS1 ectopic expression on RIG-I interaction with MAVS was examined. ubiquitination by NS1 is not due to inhibition of TRIM25 oligomerization. cells were transfected with RSV (moi=4) as indicated. lysates were subjected to GST-pulldown and immunoblotting. interaction between NS1 and TRIM25 contributes to interferon-suppressive effect of NS1. interferon-promotor activity was suppressed by ectopic expression of TRIM25. suppression of interferon- promoter activity by NS1 was also reversed. RSV NS1 inhibits RIG-I-Mediated interferon signaling. NS1 inhibited interferon- promoter activity that was induced by NS1. similar results were obtained from experimental settings using HEK293T cells. HEK293T (B) A549 (C) and HEp-2 (D) cells were transfected with RIG-IN together with increasing amounts of NS1 (63 and 250 ng/well) total RNAs were prepared 24 h after transfection and subjected to RT-qPCR to determine mRNA levels of IFN- and ISG15. all experiments were repeated at least three times. HEK293T cells were transfected with vector (pEBG-GST; 7 g/dish) or GST-RIG-I-2Cards (GST-RIG-IN; 10 g/dish) and incubated for 24 h. cell lysates were subjected to GST-pulldown and immunoblotting. NS1 interacts with RIG-IN similar to NS2. interaction between ectopically expressed TRIM25 and NS1 was detected by the co-immunoprecipitation assay. TRIM25 was also co-precipitated with NS1, supporting that RSV NS1 targets TRIM25. HEK293T cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged NS1 and V5-tagged TRIM25 expression plasmids. localization of NS1 and TRIM25 were visualized by primary antibodies and FITC- and PE-labeled secondary antibodies. arrowheads indicate bands with correct size of each construct. proline rich domain (PRD) and GST-tagged RIG-IN were detected by co-IP. however, RSV infection resulted in decrease of both RIG-IN ubiquitination and the interaction between RIG-IN and MAVS-CARD. NS1 expression diminishes the interaction between RIG-I and MAVS by interfering with TRIM25-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination. cells were transfected with GST-RIG-IN or GST vector as indicated. cells were subjected to GST-pulldown and immunoblotting. lysates were analyzed by co-IP and immunoblotting using indicated antibodies. interferon- luciferase promoter assays investigated effect of NS1. effect of NS1 was abrogated by overexpression of TRIM25. suppression of interferon- promoter activity by NS1 was reversed by ectopic expression of TRIM25. NS proteins target diverse proteins related to type-I interferon induction and signal transduction. for example, NS1 upregulates SOCS1 and SOCS3 and triggers STAT2 degradation. NS2 also degrades STAT2 to downregulate interferon-mediated JAK-STAT signaling responses. NS1 targets TRIM25, an E3-ubiquitin ligase responsible for RIG-I ubiquitination. several viruses utilize their proteins to interfere with TRIM25 activation and subsequent RIG-I activation. the Influenza NS1 binds to TRIM25 and inhibits TRIM25 multimerization. a biochemical domain mapping study revealed that the SPRY domain of TRIM25 is responsible for interaction with NS1. a possible molecular mechanism is that NS1 binds to TRIM25 and sequesters it to prevent its interaction with RIG-I. however, we could not observe a significant reduction in interaction between RIG-I and TRIM25 by NS1. RSV NS1 interacts with TRIM25 and suppresses TRIM25-mediated RIG-I activation to evade antiviral responses. further studies including structural analysis of protein interaction and analysis of the interaction modes between RIG-I, TRIM25, NS1 and NS2 need to be conducted."}
