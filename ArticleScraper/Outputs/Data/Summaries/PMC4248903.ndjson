{"summary": "this piece is written to provide insights into the entire process, from the initial report of a problem to resolution, in the fictional country of Tomainia (1). to save on production costs, I will play myself and the Greek chorus. to save on production costs, I will play myself and the Greek chorus. a common confounder is the lack of samples suitable for molecular discovery. we are reluctant to invest in unbiased high-throughput sequencing with materials that have not been stored at 80\u00b0C or in buffers designed to preserve nucleic acid integrity. patient confidentiality receives less emphasis in some countries than others. we recommend the deidentification of samples to obviate institutional review board concerns. microbial nucleic acid enrichment, library preparation, high-throughput sequencing (HTS) and downstream bioinformatics analysis require state-of-the-art infrastructure. in the 5- to 10-year time frame, discovery is likely to require a blend of work at the site of the outbreak and in a reference laboratory. in an effort to identify clusters of disease, laboratorians frequently oversimplify clinical data. in the ideal circumstance, cases within clusters are clearly related with respect to timing of onset, geography, subject age, and syndromic features. however, even in the absence of a classical cluster, one can frequently tease out which samples can be considered together. in bacterial microbiome projects, we simultaneously profile bacterial populations of cases and controls based on the assumption that neither cases nor controls are sterile. this is not because controls are sterile, but because the lower number of viral sequences in most clinical samples allows one to more easily sift through them to identify candidates that can be tested for relationship with disease. assays for viremia facilitated regulation of immunomodulatory therapy. most often, the only available CNS sample is cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in bacterial CNS infections, the rate for resolution of viral CNS infections is 50% or less (13) we build a luciferase immunoprecipitation system (LIPS) assay (14) and test for changes in antibody titer in acute- and convalescent-phase sera. we can also use this assay to determine the prevalence of infection in the general population. no real clustering was found, just a mix of what appear to be opportunistic infections in association with HIV-cryptococcus, toxoplasma, and Epstein-Barr virus"}
