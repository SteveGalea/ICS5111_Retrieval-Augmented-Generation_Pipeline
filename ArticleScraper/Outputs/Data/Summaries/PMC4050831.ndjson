{"summary": "PHLIP data is detailed, standardized influenza testing information, reported in near real-time. this was due in large part to increased adoption of HL7 messaging via PHLIP. five laboratories are being piloted for the use of their PHLIP influenza ELSM data in the NREVSS surveillance system. this would eliminate manual reporting for these sites through the NREVSS system at no additional expense or effort from reporters. surveillance epidemiologists have had to gain informatics proficiencies in order to interpret and troubleshoot the PHLIP system. be easily employed for other pathogens using the lessons learned from the ID and applying them to other situations."}
