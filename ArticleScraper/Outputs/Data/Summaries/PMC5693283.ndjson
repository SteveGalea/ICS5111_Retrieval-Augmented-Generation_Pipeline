{"summary": "lyssavirus taxonomy includes 14 lyssavirus species of the Rhabdoviridae family, order Mononegavirales [15] of which 12 species have been isolated in bats (reservoirs of the Mokola virus (MOKV) and Ikoma lyssavirus (IKOV) still remain to be identified. lyssavirus was documented for the first time in 1954 in Hamburg, Germany. from 1977 to 2016, 1,175 bat lyssavirus cases were recorded from the north to the south of the continent. a putative Lleida bat virus was detected in Spain in Miniopterus schreibersii. bat lyssavirus was identified for the first time in 1989 in the Lorraine region (North-East France) from 1989 to present, 78 bat lyssavirus cases\u201475 EBLV-1 cases in common serotine bats, 1 EBLV-1 case in common pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pipistrellus) and 2 cases of BBLV in Natterer's bats\u2014have been diagnosed in France. multi-state models are a category of capture-recapture analysis. they can also be used directly to estimate disease-associated mortality. data were analyzed using a multi-state capture-recapture approach. this is the first attempt of describing EBLV-1 exposure. both sites were chosen following the detection of bat cadavers in 2009 and 2012 for site A and 2011 for site B. infection was shown to be caused by the EBLV-1b variant, which is endemic in the region. they were the first detection of EBLV-1 infections in these municipalities. synthetic fiber swabs were soaked with saliva to assess EBLV-1 virus excretion as well as viral RNA detection. blood was collected from the antebrachial vein along the propatagium and more recently on the uropatagium. monitoring was undertaken following local authorization by the Prefect of the Lorraine Region [59]. the legal framework for using under experimentation purposes is governed by Regulation 2010/63/EU of the European parliament and of the council of 22 September 2010. ssavirus primers (JW12-N165-146) allow the detection of the nucleoprotein gene of all known lyssaviruses. rabies specific and sensitive with a limit of detection (LOD95%) of 20 copies/L of RNA [62] capture session, captured animals were classified into different serological states. the \u201cPOS\u201d state included EBLV-1 seropositive individuals. seropositive animals were defined as animals that had been in contact with the virus and seroconverted. both sites were maternity colonies mainly composed of females with roost site fidelity. males were consequently discarded from the dataset to avoid bias in the survival analysis. survival, recapture, transition and judgment probabilities were all computed by considering the serological status \u201eS\u201d as explanatory variable. a correction for small sample sizes (AICc) was used to assess the relative model fit. the model with the lowest AICc was selected as the model that fitted the data best. a logistic regression was used to assess the effect of season and year on the estimated prevalence. on site A, 6 dead animals in 2009 and one dead animal in 2012 tested positive for lyssavirus. infection was shown to be caused by the EBLV-1b variant, which is endemic in the region. dry synthetic fiber swabs were soaked with saliva to assess EBLV-1 virus excretion as well as viral RNA detection. blood was collected from the antebrachial vein along the propatagium and more recently on the uropatagium. laboratory testing Saliva analysis One saliva sample was collected per trapped individual in order to assess if animals were excreting EBLV-1. RNA was extracted from 200 l of saliva sample using the Iprep Pure LineR Virus kit (Invitrogen, France) a modified fluorescent antibody Virus Neutralisation test (mFAVNt) [64] was performed with an EBLV-1b virus strain (ANSES, N\u00b0121411, France, 2000) in order to detect EBLV-1b-specific neutralizing antibodies in blood samples. controls included uninfected BHK-21 cells, OIE positive dog serum [65], negative dog serum (ANSES collection) and back-titration of the specific EBLV-1 virus. on murine neuroblastoma cells (ATCC-CCL31) to detect any infectious lyssavirus [49, 60] and by RT-PCR to identify viral EBLV-1 RNA. the conventional hnRT-PCR technique previously described by Picard-Meyer et al. [61] was used between 2009 and 2011 for site A and in 2011 for site B. samples were tested in a threefold dilution on BHK-21 cells. controls included uninfected BHK-21 cells, OIE positive dog serum [65], negative dog serum (ANSES collection) and back-titration of the specific EBLV-1 virus. the threshold of antibody detection was calculated using the Spearman-Karber formula and set at 1.67 log D50 [41] an extension of the multievent model was used to address this particular issue. when an individual is observed in the field, its status can still remain unknown or uncertain, e.g. sex status [68], reproductive status [69] but also epidemiological status [42, 47] and such a model accounts for uncertainties in the assessment of a state. survival, recapture, transition and judgment probabilities were all computed by considering the serological status\u201cS\u201d (POS/NEG/INC) as explanatory variable. age class \u201ca\u201d (juvenile/adult) was also considered as a potential explanatory variable. a logistic regression was used to assess the effect of season and year on the estimated prevalence. for each site, a logistic regression was used to assess the effect of season and year on the estimated prevalence. the number of positive and negatives cases was used as the response variable. 156 captured bats were females (71%) while 65 were males (30%). 156 captured bats

during the study. serotine bats infected with EBLV-1 were indeed detected in 2009 and 2012 on site A and in 2011 on site B. this study focuses on a long term capture-recapture study of two serotine bat maternity colonies exposed to EBLV-1. serological transition scenarios and virus excretion EBLV-1 virus-neutralizing antibodies have been found in various bat field studies. this study is the first extensive longitudinal analysis of 2 mono-species serotine colonies, a species currently considered as the main EBLV-1 reservoir. ate positive from negative animals was determined to minimize the risk of false positive results. caution was taken to provide reliable identification of positive individuals. but could have resulted in an underestimation of seroprevalence. cobo at al. (2013) found a significantly higher antibody prevalence in summer when maternity colonies are present in most localities. the pattern was magnified by the presence of multi-species colonies compared to mono-specific colonies, with social contacts between bats. site A data showed higher prevalence in summer than in spring. hibernation of serotine bats occurs between October and end of March. but very little is known about the mating behavior. the relationship between the incubation period, hibernation season and annual birth pulse could generate complex dynamics that should attract more attention. adult female serotine bats appear to be a good indicator of EBLV-1 epizootic dynamics. this raises the question of whether adult female bats are more exposed to the virus due to the mating period in September. this raises the question of whether adult female bats are more exposed to the virus due to the mating period in September. only one experimental study of EBLV-1 infection in caged serotine bats was carried out in 2009 through different means of inoculation. it appeared that the environmental contamination of bats is unlikely as none of the intranasally-inoculated bats seroconverted. despite living in close proximity to humans, human contacts with serotine bats are rarely reported. elucidating zoonotic virus persistence in bats concomitant to unaffected survival could help solve human health challenges. survival and recapture probabilities for seropositive and seronegative animals were not correlated to the serological status. seroprevalence varied greatly according to the site location, species and time (month and year) this study is the first extensive longitudinal analysis of 2 mono-species serotine colonies, a species currently considered as the main EBLV-1 reservoir. EBLV-1 longitudinal study found 5 individuals from site A were found with viral RNA in saliva in July 2009. one was demonstrated as effectively infectious, showing that RNA in the mouth cavity can be concomitant to virus excretion. RNA in the mouth cavity can be concomitant to virus excretion. site A data revealed higher prevalence in summer than in spring. a peak of infection was observed on site B in 2013. females formed maternity colonies at the middle of April. hibernation of serotine bats occurs between October and end of March. however, very little is known about this period. the relationship between the incubation period, hibernation season and annual birth pulse could generate complex dynamics that should attract more attention. reproductive status of adult females could potentially drive inter-individual exposure. it would be valuable to consider reproductive status as \u2018pregnant\u2019, \u2018lactating\u2019 and \u2018non reproductive\u2019 for further studies. such age-related rabies dynamics we detected could also reflect greater difficulties in characterizing EBLV-1 dynamics in juveniles due to their lower occurrence than adults in the population. only one experimental study of EBLV-1 infection in caged serotine bats was carried out in 2009 through different means of inoculation [97] despite living in close proximity to humans, human contacts with serotine bats are rarely reported. despite living in close proximity to humans, human contacts with serotine bats are rarely reported. we pointed out differences of serological statuses between adult female and juveniles. elucidating zoonotic virus persistence in bats concomitant to unaffected survival could help solve human health challenges."}
