{"summary": "both the influenza A-like H17 and H18 proteins do not bind to canonical sialic acid receptors. the crystal structure of H17 and H18 revealed that these proteins possess a distorted putative sialic acid binding site. we suggest that HAs from both H17 and H18 influenza A-like viruses should be named as \u201cHA-like\u201d (HL) proteins (HL17 and HL18) internal proteins of HL17NL10 and HL18NL11 are compatible with conventional IAVs. internal proteins of HL17NL10 and HL18NL11 seem to be highly compatible with conventional IAVs. this is mainly based on results from viral polymerase reconstitution experiments. serological surveys indicate that influenza A-like viruses of the HL17 or HL18 subtypes circulate in various bat species in central and south America. up to 50% of tested samples collected from different bat species in south America are seropositive to HL18 or NL11, and specific antibodies to HL17 are found in 38% of samples collected from nine bat species in central and south America. all efforts to isolate an infectious virus from bat species have failed to date. the challenge in isolating infectious influenza A-like viruses could be related to the atypical surface proteins of these viruses. recombinant bat chimeric viruses encoding HA and NA of classical IAVs were highly infectious. conventional IAV coding regions are flanked with noncoding regions. the major packaging sequences of conventional IAV are located within these regions [14,15] and vary only slightly, thereby allowing reassortment of viral genomes between different IAVs. HL17NL10 or HL18NL11 generated by reverse genetics failed to infect human cells. this correlates with the general inability of the bat HAs and NAs to mediate cell entry into these cells. coinfection experiments demonstrated no reassortment between bat chimeric viruses and conventional IAVs."}
