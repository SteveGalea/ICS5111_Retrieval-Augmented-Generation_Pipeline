{"summary": "medical schools in the uk and the u.s. have not one evolutionary biologist on the faculty. many medical students do not even accept the theory of evolution. a review of 24 proposals for medical curriculum reform found that they consistently focused on values, especially the social nature and self-regulation of the medical profession. the challenge is to instill as much useful knowledge as possible in just a few years. evolutionary biology is not just another narrow topic, but a fundamental basic science. it can help make medical education more coherent by giving students a framework for organizing the required 10 000 facts. not many evolutionary biologists are eager to teach medical students; the best are working hard on their own research. a critical review assesses progress and directions. the examples are organized into three categories. some use well-established applications, some are new, and some remain mostly opportunities. bilirubin Understanding jaundice illustrates why both proximate and evolutionary explanations are essential. textbooks describe bilirubin as a potentially toxic metabolite of hemoglobin that can be excreted in bile only after it is made water soluble by conjugation with glucuronic acid in the liver. biliverdin is a chemical that is more soluble than bilirubin. no comparative study has investigated bilirubin levels in other primates. high bilirubin levels in the first days of life could be merely a result of the changeover to adult hemoglobin, but they could also help protect against oxidative damage from higher levels of oxygen and free iron exposure. evolution helps doctors make sense of why a disease exists at all, what environments increase the risk, and how treatments work. it has direct applications to medical research, but also provides an otherwise missing paradigm for understanding why our bodies are vulnerable to disease. many questions are about why all humans are all the same; many are about why we differ. the second major target of explanation is the evolution of pathogens. the large issues are the same, but they evolve much faster. influenza phylogenies suggest which strains are likely to spread in future epidemics. current avian influenza pandemic appears to have originated via reassortment between avian influenza strains circulating in eastern Asia. phylogenetic methods have a remarkable reach, back even into prehistory. researchers in every area of medicine use phylogenetic methods to analyze genetic data. sometimes they are used in conjunction with evolutionary theory, but they are also used independently to construct phylogenies with new applications in an era of genetic medicine. many physicians think of genes that cause disease as abnormalities in an otherwise \u2018normal\u2019 genome. the genome is a collection of genes that have tended to increase reproductive success (or hitchhiked on the success of other genes) while interacting with each other and the environment to construct a functional organism. phylogenetic analysis also used to falsify the hypothesis that HIV was introduced into Africa via polio vaccine. influenza phylogenies suggest which strains are likely to spread in future epidemics. phylogenies have a remarkable reach, back even into prehistory. two tumors that are histologically identical can have very different proteonomic signatures that make it possible to assess the level of cellular differentiation. if a tumor is all derived from the one line of cells, or from different origins arising during the tumor\u2019s growth may also be an important indicator. many physicians think of genes that cause disease as abnormalities in an otherwise \u2018normal\u2019 genome. this is a nonevolutionary view on two counts. first, it tacitly views the genome as a product of design with a blueprint that defines \u2018normal\u2019. evolutionary genetics Established principles of population genetics are being augmented by new ideas and techniques. many new methods are applied to genome scan data to identify loci subject to directional and balancing selection. early overestimates of the number of loci of interest are now being corrected. selection has increased the rates of the ApoE3 allele (Sapolsky and Finch 2000) selection has also been proposed as an explanation for cystic fibrosis. the CF gene also prevents entrance of salmonella typhus into gastrointestinal mucosal cells. gene-level selection is highlighted in the work of Trivers and others. the best known examples are the T-allele in mice and Segregation Distorter in fruit flies. the role of selfish genetic elements in human disease, including cancer, is an especially exciting area that is starting to be elucidated. 'knock-out' studies are about the evolutionary functions of a gene. they are modern equivalents of the old physiological method of extirpation. this does not mean that the gene is useless, only that its effects are covered by redundant systems, or that its benefits are manifest only in special situations. the field now seeks evolutionary explanations for why aging mechanisms exist at all. aging was a life history trait shaped by natural selection. for many species, senescence in the wild is a deleterious trait. in every culture at every age through late adulthood, mortality rates are higher for men. in modern societies, for every woman who dies at reproductive maturity, three men die. in modern societies, for every woman who dies at reproductive maturity, three men die. the economic burden of antibiotic resistance is estimated at about $80 billion annually in the USA. the economic burden of antibiotic resistance is estimated at about $80 billion annually in the USA. many doctors view antibiotics as human discoveries. individuals without the duffy antigen are less susceptible to malaria. the receptor on white blood cells allows HIV to enter. the receptor is absent in about 1% of Europeans; they do not get AIDS. steady pertussis vaccination for 40 years may have selected for more virulent strains of the whooping cough bacteria. decreased vaccination may be responsible for the increased incidence. imperfect vaccines can create selection pressures for increased virulence. the \u2018smoke detector principle\u2019 applies signal detection theory to yield quantitative predictions about how selection shaped defense regulation mechanisms. it has clinical relevance because so much everyday medicine involves prescribing medications that block defenses such as fever, pain and cough. this tends to be safe because the body has redundant defense mechanisms. anti-inflammatory drugs will increase death rates, if latter is true it will decrease them. the central defense against pathogens is, of course, the immune system. virulence is shaped to whatever level maximizes transmission. virulence is shaped to whatever level maximizes transmission. many new methods are applied to genome scan data to identify loci subject to directional and balancing selection. many new methods are applied to genome scan data to identify loci subject to directional and balancing selection. early overestimates of number of loci of interest are now being corrected. selection has increased the rates of the ApoE3 allele (Sapolsky and Finch 2000) selection has also been proposed as an explanation for cystic fibrosis. the CF gene also prevents entrance of salmonella typhus into gastrointestinal mucosal cells. the best known examples are the T-allele in mice and Segregation Distorter in fruit flies. the role of selfish genetic elements in human disease, including cancer, is an especially exciting area that is starting to be elucidated.

'thrifty phenotype' refers to the benefits of weight gain and other mechanisms that conserve calories in environments characterized by erratic nutrition. 'fetal programming' may have shaped mechanisms that adjust metabolic systems to cope with different nutritional environments. studies have called attention to the importance of the physiological state of mother and infant for the prevalence of lifestyle diseases later in life. early term miscarriage rate is over 60%, and siblings tend to be more different in their HLA immunological types than expected by chance. new evidence suggests helminths evolved a capacity to make a protein (ES-62) that down-regulates Type-II immunity that would otherwise attack them. the cross reactivity between antibodies on schistosomes and dust mites may help to explain higher rates of asthma in people of African origins. short telomeres also shorten life-span. melatonin levels increase in the dark. melatonin levels increase in the dark. melatonin levels increase in the dark. obesity has doubled in the past 40 years in the u.s., so that two-thirds of adults are now overweight or obese. diabetes and obesity are strongly correlated (Neel et al. 1998a) evolutionary view suggests two conclusions about diet, both unwelcome. most of us have built in tendencies to overeat and under-exercise when good food is available without much effort. evolution does offer a way to ground the otherwise faddish area of nutrition research. a serotonin-related polymorphism found that its strong effects on depression vulnerability were almost all mediated via an interaction with the number of severe life events. there are good theoretical reasons for thinking that low mood escalates to depression when an unreachable major life goal cannot be given up. the case has not yet been proved. research ranges from well-established applications of population genetics and phylogeny to new applications of evolution to specific medical problems such as infectious disease and aging. the fastest growth is in two disparate areas. first are those where evolution helps to make sense of new genetic data. a new framework, perhaps one based on questions such as those in the Table in the Introduction, may emerge. the boundary between basic science and applied medicine offers another challenge. lack of evolutionary understanding among physicians fosters misunderstanding about issues as important. we want doctors to have a deep knowledge base so their decisions are informed by understanding the body and disease. we want doctors to understand the ecology of immune responses, the evolutionary reasons for polygenic diseases, and the origins of antibiotics. many of the findings reviewed here suggest the answer is yes. a deep understanding of the body as a body is perhaps evolution\u2019s greatest single contribution to medicine. a deep understanding of the body as a body is perhaps evolution\u2019s greatest single contribution to medicine. giving up the machine metaphor gives medicine a stronger foundation in biology. a special issue devoted to the topic is planned for 2009. discussions are underway to organize a society for evolution and medicine. a proposal to be funded by the IARU will provide research training. the modernization of medical education will be helped by curriculum recommendations from advisory bodies such as the Institute of Medicine. the logical outcome will be evolutionary questions on the examinations like the MCATS in the USA that are used to screen applicants to medical schools. the IARU has budgeted funds for a founding meeting in 2009. a proposal to be funded by the IARU will provide research training in evolutionary medicine at six universities including the University of Copenhagen, which is recruiting a professor of evolutionary medicine. the modernization of medical education will be helped by curriculum recommendations from advisory bodies such as the Institute of Medicine. the logical outcome will be evolutionary questions on the examinations like the MCATS in the USA that are used to screen applicants. a special issue devoted to the topic is planned for 2009. it is intended to meet the need for a central source of information about new research and opportunities in the area of evolution and medicine. the modernization of medical education will be helped by curriculum recommendations from advisory bodies such as the Institute of Medicine. the modernization of medical education will be helped by curriculum recommendations from advisory bodies such as the Institute of medicine."}
