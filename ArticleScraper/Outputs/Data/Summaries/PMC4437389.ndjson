{"summary": "neopterin is produced from guanosine triphosphate via guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH I) at its first isolation in the 1960s neopterin was detected in the pupae of bees by anion exchange. gas chromatographic-massfragmentographic methods were described allowing measurement in urine. neopterin was detected in serum, urine, and other body fluids. chromatography followed by paper chromatography allowing measurement in urine. in measles vaccination neopterin levels were observed to rise at a median of 5 days after vaccination about 7 days before the appearance of antibodies. the magnitude of the elicited neopterin levels could be put into relation to incidence of the disease immunised against the population of immunised children. neopterin levels were found to increase early in the course of HIV infection preceeding CD4+-T-cell decline and clinical manifestations of AIDS [23, 24]. plasma neopterin levels were found to predict HIV related mortality [26, 27]. a retrospective study compared 2 microglobulin, immunoglobulin A, G, and M, adenosine deaminase, and neopterin levels above normal range. neopterin may be a particularly useful surrogate marker for monitoring of control of HIV replication in settings where HIV RNA viral load measurement is not available. neopterin may be a cheaper alternative especially if semiquantitative dip stick tests are used for urine samples. the first study investigating the role of neopterin in specific forms of viral hepatitis tested urinary levels in 51 patients with acute viral hepatitis 49 patients had elevated urinary neopterin levels. neopterin levels were not a reflection of hepatocellular damage. neopterin concentrations were evaluated in 260 patients treated by pegylated interferon combined with ribavirin. the rate of response was twofold higher among patients with sustained virological response than in nonresponders. neopterin levels had a mean of 14.5 nmol/L in replicative versus 8.8 nmol/L in nonreplicative HBV carriers. cirrhosis patients had significantly higher serum neopterin levels than patients with chronic hepatitis (P = 0.004) positive correlations were detected between serum neopterin levels and inflammatory score in patients with chronic hepatitis and cirrhotic patients (r = 0.41, P = 0.004) investigators used the CRP/neopterin ratio (C/N ratio) to discriminate viral and bacterial etiology of respiratory tract infections. the median of the C/N ratio was 10 times higher in patients with bacterial aetiology than with viral aetiology. pterins have a low permeability across the blood brain barrier with a serum-to-CSF distribution at a quotient of 1/40. individual normal CSF neopterin concentrations were found to be invariant to the variation of the albumin quotient, QAlb. patients with viral meningitis had elevated CSF neopterin levels compared to healthy controls. no significant difference in CSF neopterin concentrations was found between those treated with protease inhibitor- and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase based regimens. this would support the idea that viral replication within or close to the CSF, at least to some extent, is partly driving the inflammatory response. in acute varicella zoster virus infection peak neopterin levels were observed at the end of the appearance of the rash and in measles virus infection one to three days after appearance of the rash. in measles vaccination neopterin levels were observed to rise at a median of 5 days after vaccination about 7 days before the appearance of antibodies. p24 antigen positive had elevated neopterin levels (>10 nmol/L) 6/216 (2.8%) samples, which were both HIV-1 and p24 antigen negative, had elevated neopterin levels. studies investigated markers of immune activation for their usefulness as prognostic markers in HIV infection. RT inhibitor treatment decreased circulating levels of neopterin (mean of 15.6 for treated versus a mean of 22.3 ng/mL for untreated HIV patients, P 0.04) neopterin levels in patients who discontinued HAART became similar to untreated HIV patients. blood, urine Levels declined on twice weekly measurements in all monitored patients with pulmonary tuberculosis on treatment. neopterin levels normalized rapidly within 10 weeks of treatment. in 51 patients with acute viral hepatitis 49 patients had elevated urinary neopterin levels. transfusion significantly more patients with histologically proven chronic hepatitis had elevated blood neopterin levels compared to patients with siderosis of the liver [45]. serum neopterin levels were found to be a useful predictor of response to treatment of chronic HCV infection with pegylated interferon combined with ribavirin. hepatitis the mean SD serum neopterin levels were 14.2 5.6 nmol/L, 20.3 7.9 nmol/L in patients with liver cirrhosis and 5.2 1.4 nmol/L in the control group. serum neopterin levels were significantly higher in patients with chronic hepatitis (P = 0.005) than in control subjects. patients on steroid therapy had significantly lower neopterin levels. measured neopterin in isolation and in relation to other inflammatory markers like procalcitonin and C-reactive protein. elevated neopterin levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with aseptic meningitis and herpes simplex and measles virus encephalomyelitis. pterins have a low permeability across the blood brain barrier with a serum-to-CSF distribution at a quotient of 1/40 [55] patients with systemic virological failure exhibit a substantial reduction of CSF neopterin concentrations, though above that of virologically suppressed patients. no significant difference was found between those treated with protease inhibitor- and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase based regimens in combination with 2 nucleoside analogues. neopterin levels were found to have a specificity of 78% for discriminating infectious and noninfectious etiology of critical illness. neopterin levels were found to have a specificity of 78% for discriminating infectious and noninfectious etiology of critical illness. infection with Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum (syphilis) was not associated with elevated neopterin levels. in brucellosis neopterin levels were with a mean 52.5 mmol/mL significantly higher than healthy controls. the elevation of neopterin in patients with tuberculosis was more pronounced in urine than in serum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. the elevation of neopterin in patients with tuberculosis was more pronounced in urine than in serum or bronchoalveolar lavage. urinary neopterin levels declined on twice weekly measurements in all monitored patients with pulmonary tuberculosis on treatment and fell to below tolerance limits within 10 weeks of treatment. neopterin levels were higher than the baseline levels of HIV negative tuberculosis patients and levels were higher in patients with lower CD4 count. matched controls for every extent of pulmonary disease and correlated with its extent. higher levels of neopterin in serum and pleural effusions of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis compared to controls. neopterin levels declined on twice weekly measurements in all monitored patients with pulmonary tuberculosis on treatment and fell to below tolerance limits within 10 weeks of treatment. neopterin levels remained above the baseline levels of HIV negative tuberculosis patients and levels were higher in patients with lower CD4 count. all patients had elevated urinary neopterin levels compared to uninfected controls to a level of 664 to 5189 micromol neopterin/mol creatinine. levels in nonimmune patients and young children were higher than semiimmune individuals. CSF IgM and neopterin were the best in discriminating between the two stages (S1 and S2) of disease with 86.4% and 84.1% specificity. neopterin correctly classified 88% of S1 and S2 patients, confirming its high staging power. 5.26% of 1767 donors with increased neopterin levels were positive for CMV IgM indicating acute infection. neopterin is a nonspecific marker of activated cell mediated immunity involving release of interferon gamma. longitudinal serial measurements in the same individual could overcome difficulties with interpretation in settings where chronic parasitic infections may elevate the baseline neopterin level. this could allow monitoring of response to antiretroviral, antituberculous, and antiparasitic treatment in the absence of resistance testing. this is particularly important in the current context of emerging multiple drug resistance of HIV and mycobacterium tuberculosis."}
