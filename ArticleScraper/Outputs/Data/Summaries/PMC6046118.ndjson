{"summary": "aims This article discusses the impacts of SARS in 2003 and H7N9 in 2013 in china. results Both outbreaks of SARS and H7N9 have had an impact on China. the social and economic impacts of H7N9 were not as serious as in case of SARS because the response to H7N9 was more effective. study drew on literature review, document analysis, and in-depth interviews. results 3.1. Impacts of SARS in 2003 and H7N9 in 2013 in china. worldwide, in just 6 months, there were more than 8000 infected individuals. the psychological impact of SARS was also very serious. the distress was more prominent among nurses who were working with patients with SARS. panic spread from Guangzhou to shenzhen, Zhuhai, and other areas. people began to believe the rumors and the buying of antiviral drugs. a 72-year-old retired surgeon wrote to the media criticizing the health department for hiding the epidemic situation. the epidemic brought great harm not only to peoples' physical and mental health, but also to the economy. it was estimated that Asian states lost USD 12\u201318 billion as the SARS crisis depressed travel, tourism, and retail sales. families reduced their demand for food, clothes, travel, and entertainment; the numbers of guests in hotels declined sharply. the 2003 SARS outbreak caused losses of USD 12.3-28.4 billion and an estimated decrease of 1% in GDP in China and 0.5% in Southeast Asia [15]. the social burden of SARS in Guangzhou meant less income and spending. there are 589 laboratory-confirmed cases of H7N9 that had been reported, with 259 deaths in China in 2017. the influenza H7N9 virus remains a large threat due to its virulent nature in poultry. the significance still remains over whether H7N9 could be the next pandemic strain of influenza [24] more than 80% of respondents expressed satisfaction with the government's prevention and control of human infection with H7N9 avian influenza. more than 50% believed that the prevention and control of human infection with H7N9 avian influenza had changed their health habits. more than 50% believed that the prevention of human infection with H7N9 avian influenza had changed their health habits. the avian influenza outbreak caused the price index of meat and poultry to fall to 101.5 on a year-on-year basis. the high mortality of H7N9 changed the attitude of the public towards chickens. the virus resulted in serious economic losses to farmers. the health, societal, and economic impacts of the two infectious disease outbreaks were quite different. Table 1. impact on health, society, and economy of SARS and H7N9 in china. by 11 July 2003, the virus had spread to 29 countries and regions. worldwide, in just 6 months, there were more than 8000 infected individuals. the psychological impact of SARS was also very serious. the distress was more prominent among the groups of nurses working with patients with SARS. in 2003, people were wearing masks everywhere on the streets in Guangzhou. panic spread from Guangzhou to shenzhen, Zhuhai, and other areas. people began to believe the rumors, and the buying of antiviral drugs began in Beijing. asian states lost USD 12\u201318 billion as the SARS crisis depressed travel, tourism, and retail sales. families reduced their demand for food, clothes, travel, and entertainment, and the numbers of guests in hotels declined sharply. the international tourism, transport, and business sectors were seriously affected. the 2003 SARS outbreak caused losses of USD 12.3-28.4 billion. the social burden of SARS in Guangzhou meant less income and spending. the influence of SARS also spread to the manufacturing industry. rumors about the epidemic spread through word of mouth, mobile phone short messages, social media transmission, and other ways. the spread of all kinds of rumors exacerbated the spread of social panic. one rumor was that Banlangen (Radix isatidis) could prevent and control SARS. the lack of understanding of SARS by authorities or the media caused a number of experts to become dissatisfied. a 72-year-old retired surgeon wrote to the media criticizing the health department for hiding the epidemic situation. on the same day, an academic from the Chinese Academy of Engineering questioned the information provided by government about control of the epidemic. the global macroeconomic impact of SARS was estimated at USD 30\u2013100 billion. the 2003 SARS outbreak caused losses of USD 12.3-28.4 billion and an estimated decrease of 1% in GDP in China and 0.5% in Southeast Asia. interviews with 71 households in Qinling Mountain in Shaanxi Province indicated that in the second quarter of 2003 SARS caused the average annual household income to decline to US$175.44, 22.36% below what was expected [18]. health Effects H7N9 avian influenza is another infectious disease that has caused severe illness and death in humans in China. the significance still remains over whether H7N9 could be the next pandemic strain of influenza [24]. there were rumors that people could be infected with H7N9 from eating chicken and that pickled peppers and onions can prevent H7N9. there were no impacts on the city life in Beijing during H7N9. the timeline from first hospitalization of a case to confirmation and notification of H7N9 in 2013 is shown in Figure 1. the government management of the health and agriculture sectors was completely open, so I completely believed them and I felt no panic. the fast and effective countermeasures by Chinese authorities to H7N9 avian influenza were not only highly considered by the inspection mission of WHO. the health, societal, and economic impacts of the two infectious disease outbreaks were quite different. the economic impacts of H7N9 were less serious than SARS but still important to characterize. the price index of meat and poultry and their products fell to 101.5 on a year-on-year basis. cases of H7N9 avian influenza were confirmed on the Chinese mainland, Taiwan and Hong Kong area, where 48 died. a case fatality rate of 32.43% was 32.43%. the global macroeconomic impact of SARS was estimated at USD 30\u2013100 billion or around USD 3\u201310 million per case. there are 589 laboratory-confirmed cases of H7N9 that had been reported, with 259 deaths in China in 2017. there is no H7N9 vaccine available, although some vaccine manufacturers are conducting clinical evaluations of a H7N9 vaccine. the influenza H7N9 virus remains a large threat due to its virulent nature in poultry. more than 80% of respondents expressed satisfaction with the government's prevention and control of human infection with H7N9 avian influenza. more than 50% believed that the prevention and control of human infection with H7N9 avian influenza had changed their health habits. more than 50% of respondents believed that the prevention of human infection with H7N9 avian influenza had changed their health habits. the avian influenza outbreak caused the price index of meat and poultry to fall to 101.5 on a year-on-year basis. the high mortality of H7N9 changed the attitude of the public towards chickens and it became apparent that few cared for chickens in the market. a total of 148 cases of H7N9 avian influenza were confirmed on the Chinese mainland, Taiwan and Hong Kong area. by 11 July 2003, the virus had spread to 29 countries and regions, with a cumulative number of confirmed cases of 8096 people. by 11 July 2003, the virus had spread to 29 countries and regions. china's emergency management of the two epidemics varied. despite similarities of SARS and H7N9, mortality of H7N9 was much higher than in the case of SARS. an effective and efficient emergency response can reduce avoidable mortality and morbidity. data Availability The datasets generated and/or analysed in this study are available from the first author or corresponding author on reasonable request.
