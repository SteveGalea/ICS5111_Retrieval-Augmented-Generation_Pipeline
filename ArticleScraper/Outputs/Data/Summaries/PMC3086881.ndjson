CHIKV is an arthropod\u2013borne virus which can be transmitted to humans by Aedes mosquitoes [2], widespread in some tropical regions [3]\u2013[8]. CHIKV is an arthropod\u2013borne virus which can be transmitted to humans by Aedes mosquitoes [2], widespread in some tropical regions 82% of residents in the village with the largest number of reported cases, shows a 10.2% of protected individuals [18]. higher prevalences were observed in la Reunion Island and in mayotte, Indian Ocean, 38.2% and 37.2% respectively. a set of interventions were undertaken to control the epidemic spread. a population dynamics model accounting for seasonal temperature variations was used to estimate vector abundance. temperature plays a very significant role as it affects development and mortality rates of Aedes albopictus [10], [21], influencing vector abundance and distribution over time [22]. the population dynamics model was then coupled to an epidemic transmission model describing the spread of the epidemic in both humans and mosquitoes. the model simulates the abundance of the vector in the four life stages of Aedes albopictus, namely eggs (), larvae (), pupae (), female adults () as follows: (1) where, and are the temperature dependent developmental rates; is the average number of eggs laid in one oviposition; is the carrying capacity of eggs; the term in the fourth equation accounts for the sex ratio (sex ratio is 11, as reported in [21]. a latent vector enters the infectious class after an average latent period of days and remains infectious for the rest of its life. the 4th Eq. of system (1) is replaced by the following three equations: (2) where (3) Moreover, as we assume that the infection does not affect oviposition, the first Eq. of system (1) becomes: (4) A susceptible host enters the latent class following the bite of an infectious vector at the per capita rate. the probability that a major outbreak of the disease would occur after the introduction of a single infective host is given by (9) where the terms and are defined in Eq. (6) and (7). to estimate, for example, the length of the egg hatching period is reported in [21]. the same technique was used to estimate the length of larval and pupal development and the length of the gonotrophic cycle. Fig. 2b shows a comparison between observed and modeled data. c Mortality rates of eggs at temperatures, as reported in [21]. vertical bars represent 95% CI of predicted values. other colors refer to mortality rates of larvae (green), pupae (blue) and adult females (orange) 5% CI) 0.092 506 (43.4,925) 506 (43.4,925) 27.3 (18.3,30.8) 0.012 0.029 (0.017,0.041) 858 (20.6,973) 43.4 (39.7,43.5) 0.005 0.021 (0.018,0.026) 37 (14.8,57) 36.8 (35.8,37.2) 0.003 0.031 (0.028,0.04) 95820 (2954,98553) 50.4 the exact number of breeding sites in the area at the time of the epidemic is unknown. in this study we considered different values of, namely 50, 100, 150 and 200 ha, in order to describe different (high) densities of mosquitoes. these different scenarios are thus characterized by average values of the carrying capacity in the range. the time step was chosen short enough to obtain, on average, results comparable with those obtained by simulating the deterministic version of the model. infections occur with probability where is the force of infection (see for example [38]\u2013[40]). the optimal parameter set was chosen as the one minimizing the score function. we repeated the above described procedure 100 times. this allowed us to estimate distributions of model parameters. the index case was recorded on June 23 2007. the four developmental rates correspond to egg hatching (), pupation (), adult emergence () and gonotrophic cycle (). the number of eggs laid at each gonotrophic cycles is not significantly different within a range of temperature between and [21]. the number of eggs laid at each gonotrophic cycles does not depend on temperature. a latent host becomes infectious after an average latent period of days. a latent host develops symptoms with probability and then, after an average infectious period of days, recovers. the epidemic transmission process in humans can be modeled by the following system of ordinary differential equations. the probability that a major outbreak of the disease would occur after the introduction of a single infective host is given by (9) where the terms and are defined in Eq. (6) and (7). daily air temperature and relative humidity, measured two meters above ground, were obtained from the urban weather station of Ravenna, the closest city to the two italian villages affected by CHIKV. average daily air temperature is reported (green line), showing that water temperature is hardly comparable to air temperature (RMSE = 2.8) we estimated mortality rates of eggs, larvae and pupae as a function of temperature. the same procedure was used to estimate the mortality rates of eggs at different temperatures. parasitism and deficient nutrients have been found to cause a 35% increase in larval mortality. mortality rates for immature stages ( and ) and adults () were multiplied by a factor. the average number of eggs per oviposition is not significantly different at each gonotrophic cycle between and and in our simulations was uniformly chosen in the interval eggs eggs. since 2008 a monitoring activity has been carried out in order to estimate the water temperature of breeding sites. most of Aedes albopictus life stages develop in aquatic micro\u2013environment. a linear regression model was used to estimate the daily mean water temperature as a function of daily mean, maximum and minimum air temperature and daily mean air relative humidity. the time step was chosen short enough to obtain, on average, results comparable with those obtained by simulating the deterministic version of the model. we sample from a binomial distribution with probability, where is given in Eq. (3), and sample size, where is the number of susceptible mosquitoes. results of the optimization procedure are shown in Fig. S1. 100 simulations are sufficient to obtain meaningful distribution of parameters and quantities of interest. most cases (161) occurred in the two neighboring villages of Castiglione di Cervia and Castiglione di Ravenna. a distribution (2.5%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 97.5% percentiles) of the probability of observing a major outbreak for different numbers of breeding sites. c Average effective reproduction number (black line, scale on the left) and 95% CI (grey area) over time by assuming = 200 ha and no interventions. s to humans depends on the number of vectors which substantially varies over time as a result of seasonal meteorological factors. we estimated to be 3.3 on average (95% CI 1.8\u20136, see Fig. 4e) the estimated biting rate increases by decreasing the number of breeding sites. the index case was a man of Indian origin from Kerala living in Castiglione di Cervia. he only reported contact with a relative of his, who had arrived in Italy on June 21 2007 from Kerala, India. he visited him in Castiglione di Cervia village while feverish. therefore, having the human index case being identified, we can reasonably exclude the contemporaneous introduction of infected vectors. cities like Cesena (96,000 inhabitants), Rimini (141,000 inhabitants) and Bologna (377,000 inhabitants) and Ravenna (157,000 inhabitants) did not experience any epidemic outbreak, though sporadic CHIKV cases were recorded in the same period [1], [42]\u2013[44]. these results support the hypothesis that outbreaks of Chikungunya virus in temperate climate countries are probable after the importation of an index case from abroad. c and d As a and b respectively but for assuming an intervention resulting in the following reductions. as for the undertaken interventions, breeding sites and eggs were removed on august 23 2007, larvicides were used on august 23. adulticides were used from august 23 to august 25 2007. the number of cases drastically decreased in late august while the effective reproduction number would have fallen below the epidemic threshold in late September. this proves that a combined strategy resulted in a drastic reduction of the epidemic impact, despite the relatively large value of. reduction of 40% as for breeding sites and eggs, 90% as for larvae and 95% as for adults, and ha. the horizontal dashed red line represents the observed percentage of symptomatic cases. results are shown only for ha. the two affected villages account for 2.1% of the population of the municipalities of Cervia (27,000 inhabitants) and Ravenna (157,000 inhabitants). the exact number of commuters for Castiglione di Cervia and Castiglione di Ravenna is unknown but it should not exceed 2.1% of the overall number of commuters. the two most affected villages are located in the municipalities of Cervia and Ravenna. our results suggest that the transmission potential of CHIKV in Italy was similar to the one observed in tropical regions where Chikungunya fever is widespread. the proposed model has several limitations. we assume exponential distribution for all parameters of model related to the length of the different periods (e.g. latency, infectiousness, etc.) but it would be preferable to use multiple classes within each group to give more realistic gamma distributed lifetimes. the inset shows the minimum of for the 100 replicates (red points) the blue vertical line represent the number of notified cases reported to the surveillance system before intervention, namely 132. b As a but for ha.
