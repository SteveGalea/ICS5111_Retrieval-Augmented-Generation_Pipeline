{"summary": "animal i in disease state X, a value TX(i) is defined, describing the expected time that animal i spends in category X given progression to X at a previous time step. each individual has its predefined shedding rates D(i) and C(i) associated with the diseased and the carrier state. shedding occurs at average rates r k = i X r X ( i ) = 1 / T X ( i ) from a state X (X = S, L, D, C, or R) to the next state in the SLDCRS sequence. pathogen shedding rates D(i) and C(i) and bacterial decay rates rB = 1/TB. the model was parameterized for footrot in sheep, with Dichelobacter nodosus bacteria as the primary infectious agent. in the benchmark model there was no variation between individuals in any of the host-specific epidemiological parameters (TS, TL, TD, TC, TR, D, and C) defined. the value for TS was chosen to yield footrot prevalences similar to those reported in field studies. there are no estimates of the duration of the asymptotic carrier state in the literature. values for the host-specific epidemiological trait in question were drawn from a two-parameter continuous gamma distribution with shape parameter and scale parameter. the individual transition rates between successive disease states in the epidemiological model are then the inverse of the corresponding gamma-distributed time periods. a large number of genes each with an infinitesimally small effect would correspond to a symmetric distribution, whereas the presence of few loci with large effects on the trait of interest could give rise to a skewed distribution. distributions for each epidemiological trait for which variation was assumed were generated with the same trait mean () as that of the benchmark model for homogeneous populations. the impact of host heterogeneity was assessed by four different epidemic characteristics. we calculated the probability of the disease to exist in the population at different time points. we recorded disease incidence, the total number of new infections over the simulated time period, as measure of disease severity. animal i in disease state X, a value TX(i) is defined, describing the expected time that animal i spends in category X given progression to X at a previous time step. each individual has its predefined shedding rates D(i) and C(i) associated with the diseased and the carrier state. in the population as a whole we define the average rate of infection of susceptible individuals as r 1 = i S r S ( i ) E, where E is the environmental bacterial load, r S ( i ) = 1 / T S ( i ) and the sum is taken over all susceptible individuals. shedding occurs at average rates r 6 = i D k D ( i ) and r 7 = i C k C ( i ). the model was parameterized for footrot in sheep, with Dichelobacter nodosus bacteria as the primary infectious agent. in the benchmark model there was no variation between individuals in any of the host-specific epidemiological parameters (TS, TL, TD, TC, TR, D, and C) defined. there are no estimates of the duration of the asymptotic carrier state in the literature. only a small proportion of animals per flock become carriers. a short duration of 1 day was assumed for this state (TC = 1 day) gamma distributions can adopt a variety of shapes, such as concave ( 1), nearly symmetric ( large), or unimodal and strongly right skewed ( 1). smaller values indicate greater heterogeneity as well as a greater degree of asymmetry and peakedness. distributions for each epidemiological trait for which variation was assumed were generated with the same trait mean () as that of the benchmark model for homogeneous populations. to assess the influence of the source of genetic variation, outputs corresponding to distributions for different epidemiological traits of the same shape were compared (i.e., different and the same mean value. infected individuals are individuals of categories L, D, or C. observable phenotypic infection characteristics, such as the frequency of infections, and the number of days that an individual was infected, were calculated for each individual. TB = 12 days (Figure 2, A, C, and E), 0.31 when TB = 1.5 days (Figure 2, B, D, and F), and 0.03 when TB = 1 day (not shown) the probability of disease prevalence at time t was calculated as the proportion of replicates with at least one infected individual at time t. positively skewed variation in host susceptibility tends to increase the probability of footrot establishment (Figure 2, A and B) for TB = 1.5 days, the risk of footrot persistence in populations with the same degree of variation in TD and D decreases from 0.31 to 0.08. there is little difference between the probabilities of disease establishment associated with host variation in TD or D. skewed distribution with great dispersion for host susceptibility (TS) and duration of immunity (TR) tend to increase disease prevalence (Figure 3, A, B, E, and F), while similarly skewed distributions for the duration of the diseased period (TD) and for the duration of immunity (TR) tend to increase disease prevalence (Figure 3, A, B, E, and F) influence of host variation on the predicted overall footrot severity in the population was found to depend similarly on the degree of dispersion and on environmental conditions as was observed for disease risk and prevalence profiles. for TB = 1.5 days, the average number of incidences increased from 4387 for homogeneous populations to 13,776 in populations with large variation in TS ( = 0.25). individual variation in observable infection characteristics occurs for homogeneous population due to stochasticity. TB = 12 days TB = 1.5 days TB = 12 days TB = 1.5 days TB = 1.5 days TB = 1.5 days TB = 1.5 days. the scale parameter was chosen so that the population mean is the same as for homogeneous populations. the predicted impact of variation on the predicted infection characteristics was found to be negligible. heterogeneity in TS mainly affects averages and variances in the observable infection characteristics when environmental contamination is low. for homogeneous populations the probability of footrot persistence was 0.86 when TB = 12 days (Figure 2, A, C, and E), 0.31 when TB = 1.5 days (Figure 2, B, D, and F) and 0.03 when TB = 1 day (Figure 2B) positively skewed variation in host susceptibility tends to increase the probability of footrot establishment. variation in the duration of the diseased period (TD) and in shedding rates (D) tends to decrease the risk of footrot establishment in the population. for TB = 12 days, the probability of disease persistence for 3 years decreases from 0.86 for homogeneous populations to 0.46 and 0.45, for variation in TD and D with = 0.25, respectively. for TB = 1.5 days, the risk of footrot persistence in populations with the same degree of variation in TD and D decreases from 0. the average prevalence at time t was determined from all replicates avoiding extinction at time t. skewed distribution with great dispersion for host susceptibility tend to increase disease prevalence. variation in host susceptibility may affect disease progression in the population at the early stages. variable in the duration of the diseased period (TD) and shedding rate (D), as well as in the duration of immunity (TR), affect predicted disease prevalence only in environmental conditions favoring bacterial survival. a large proportion of individuals with fast recovery (low TR) decreases prevalence levels compared to those observed for homogeneous populations with the same mean recovery rate at any stage of the epidemics. populations with large variation TR experienced a substantially higher average number of incidences (i.e., 24,465 incidences) the impact of host heterogeneity, when expressed in different environments, on the frequencies and number of days that animals are infected per year. with some exceptions, standard deviations in these characteristics were also higher for higher values of TB. values and parameters are defined in Table 1 for other epidemiological parameters (e.g., TS, TD, and TR) the predicted impact of variation on the predicted infection characteristics was found to be negligible. positively skewed host variation in susceptibility and immunity has a detrimental effect on observable infection characteristics. heterogeneity in TS mainly affects averages and variances in the observable infection characteristics when environmental contamination is low. heterogeneity in TD and TR shows their impact on infection characteristics in all simulated environments. variation in other epidemiological parameters, in particular shedding rates, was found to have no significant effect on average or variation in host infection characteristics simultaneously. the presence of few high shedders does not necessarily increase disease risk if the majority of individuals have low pathogen shedding rates. the impact of variation in a particular trait depends strongly on the role of this trait in the progression of the disease in the population. heterogeneity in host susceptibility was found to increase disease risk and severity in all modeled environments. but its impact was much stronger when environmental contamination was low. previous studies often differ in their predictions for the effect of host variation owing to different definitions of host genetic heterogeneity. variation in infectiousness tends to decrease disease prevalence at all times. compared to directly transmitted diseases, the influence of few highly infectious individuals on the spread of disease is diffused when transmission occurs through an environmental source. the impact of genetic variation on the risk of disease emergence depends on to the source of genetic heterogeneity. heterogeneous populations with a large proportion of highly susceptible individuals have a higher risk of disease emergence, but the emergence risk will not decrease if the majority of individuals are resistant. a significant role in the persistence of the disease in the population has been attributed to these carriers. variation in different epidemiological traits can influence very differently disease risk and severity. the question therefore arises whether genetic variation in these alternative traits can be identified using currently available disease data and statistical methods. the results of our study elucidate that the choice of the most appropriate selection strategy would depend on the parent and offspring environment. selection against high susceptibility would be the most efficient means to reduce disease risk and prevalence in environments with low contamination risk."}
