{"summary": "a set of 2.6 M 15-mers that are more than 1 nucleotide different from all 15-mers in the human genome could be used as probes to detect microbes. the human genome is significantly more compact in sequence space than a random genome. chromosomes 1, 2, 9, 12 and 14 have a relatively high proportion of coding DNA without high entropy. chromosome 20 is the opposite with a low frequency of coding regions but relatively high entropy. this information may be used to detect novel microbes in human tissues. the set of all oligos of length n defines an n-dimensional discrete space, Sn where each point is a possible n-mer and each dimension has only four states (A, C, G or T) we have also measured the frequency of unique n-mers in those species and the compactness of the human genome in n-mer space. we have identified all 5- to 20-mers that appear in the human genome more than 30,000 times. the n-mer space coverage for each genome is plotted against oligo length n. the human genome includes all 8-mers, and less than 0.21% of all 16-mers. the human genome has a much higher coverage than the yeast genome for every oligo length. the space coverage of each genome listed above is plotted against the length of the oligomer analyzed, ranging from 1 to 20. the coverage analysis of genomes can be used to analyze the complexity of any fully sequenced genome. the human and mouse genome has only 5% unique hits among all the 13-mers they contain, while Drosophila, Arabidopsis, and yeast have only a single copy of more than 50% of their 13-mers. the percentage of n-mers that appeared exactly once (unique hits), out of all the n-mers detected in each genome. .308% 84.633% 84.444% 15 62.041% 61.865% 62.217% 62.124% 16 37.065% 36.934% 37.197% NA2 17 16.156% 16.058% 16.254% NA 18 5.332% 5.278% 5.386% NA 19 1.529% 1.508% 1.551% NA 20 0.382% 0.369% 0.396% NA 1100,000 n-mers were used to estimate coverage. oligonucleotide array hybridization experiment uses these 2.6 M non-human 15-mers to determine the likelihood of detecting any of the fully sequenced microbes. this hypothetical array would detect 75% (2314 of 3065) viruses with a median of 3 positive non-human 15-mers (range: 0 to 1,705) and 100% (of 433) bacterial species with a median of 3,873 positive non-human 15-mers.

the pseudo-human genome has much higher space coverage than the true human genome for every oligo length. this leads to the hypothesis that human genome has much higher space coverage than the true human genome for every oligo length. for each of the n-mers found in the human genome, we generated its 3n different 1 bp variants and then scanned the human genome for the presence of these variants. the same is true for 2\u20134 bp variants of human oligos. the human genome is more compact in sequence space than a random genome. entropy was calculated from either the entire chromosome, for chromosomes 130 Mb, or the first 130 Mb of longer chromosomes. this is sufficient to generate stable estimates of the entropy. the entropy calculation converges after 10 million bases. n-mer space coverage for each genome is plotted against oligo length n. the human genome includes all 8-mers, and less than 0.21% of all 16-mers. the true human genome has less coverage of n-mer space than the pseudo-human genome. the pseudo-human (pseudo-hs) genome is a random genome generated with the same length and dinucleotide frequencies of the human genome. the space coverage of each genome listed above is plotted against the length of the oligomer analyzed, ranging from 1 to 20. a histogram for the proportion of the 10-mer sequence space covered by each of the 433 fully sequenced microbial genomes. the human and mouse genome has only 5% unique hits among all the 13-mers they contain. a PCR primer for human and mouse genomes should be greater than 17 bp. space n-mer Mean Coverage from

pseudo-human genome has much higher space coverage than the true human genome for every oligo length. for each of the n-mers found in the human genome, we generated its 3n different 1 bp variants and then scanned the human genome for the presence of these variants. thus, the human genome is more compact, or dense in sequence space than a random genome. entropy rate Previous studies have examined the entropy within regions of a genome. we calculated the information content of each human chromosome. this facilitates comparisons between chromosomes. chromosomes 1, 2, 9, 12, and 14 have a lower information content than might be expected for the percent of those chromosomes occupied by protein coding regions. chromosome 20 appears to have a higher entropy than would be expected given its gene poor content. whiteford et al. have analyzed a measure of the frequency of unique oligos in a variety of genomes [23] but their measure is subtly different from ours. the measure of uniqueness essentially shatters a genome into n-mers and asks what proportion of those n-mers only occur once in the genome. this is appropriate for analyzing high throughput, short sequencing reads, since high copy-number n-mers will represent a large chromosomes 13, 18, 21 and the Y chromosome appear to have relatively low entropy compared to the rest of the genome. the correlation between nucleotides at varying distances is also known to be higher in coding regions than non-coding regions. chromosome 20 has a relatively low proportion of coding regions without relatively low entropy. 35 of the human genome was missing 225 Mbp of the human sequence (7% of the genome), 200 Mbp of which is made up of heterochromatin. the remaining 25 Mbp of euchromatic gaps are often associated with segmental duplications and copy number variations between subjects used for the reference sequencing [30]. a panel of 2.6 M 15-mers that are at least 2 SNPs different from human 15-mers could easily detect all bacterial genomes and 75% of fully sequenced viruses. this approach is inspired by the negative selection algorithm used by the immune system: generate random amino acid sequence (peptide) detectors. this was used to identify the SARS virus as a coronavirus[42,43], though the array may not identify novel viruses that are dissimilar from the known viral families. a brute force metagenomics approach involves sequencing all the DNA or RNA in the sample and removing any sequences that match the human genome. we searched the genomes for all possible 1- to 15-mers. the algorithm follows: 1. Given oligo length n, create a boolean array of size 4n. for each chromosome, create a boolean array of size 4n. the algorithm is guaranteed to find all n-mers that appear at least 30,000 times in the human genome. we counted the number of times the 4K (n+1)-mers appear in the human genome. if a 20-mer occurs > 30,000 times in the human genome, then all prefixes of that 20-mer must occur at least as many times as the 20-mer. the algorithm parses the string sequentially to produce a dictionary of new phrases. the four phrases corresponding to the single nucleotides 'A', 'C', 'G' and 'T' form the first entries in the dictionary of phrases. the parsing procedure proceeds recursively finding each new phrase in the sequence in turn. the probability of evenly covering sequence space in a random genome decreases as the frequency of nucleotides is skewed from a uniform distribution. both variables and their interaction were significant at p 0.01. only one of the five genomes had a 10-mer coverage value that fell outside the 99.9% prediction range. oligomers of length 10\u201320 bp appear > 30,000 times in the human genome. oligomers of length 10\u201320 bp appear > 30,000 times in the human genome. oligomers of length 10\u201320 bp appear > 30,000 times in the human genome. all 20-mers that appear > 30,000 times are identified by the algorithm. this algorithm can be extended to arbitrary length oligomers for any positive lower bound on the frequency of the oligomers. the algorithm requires no priori knowledge of source statistics (hence is \"universal\") d(n) denotes the number of dictionary items that have been generated after parsing n consecutive symbols in the genome string. the number of bits needed to describe the dictionary up to this point provides a simple compression mechanism. theoretical entropy analysis of random pseudo-human genome converges very quickly as seen in Figure 5. it is informative to consider the n-mer coverage of a random pseudo-human genome of the same length as the human genome and with the nucleotides A, C, G, and T appearing with equal frequency. the n-mer space coverage of the pseudo-human genome will bound from above the corresponding n-mer space coverage of the human genome. the simplest model of a random pseudo-human genome is a sequence of nucleotides drawn by independent sampling from the alphabet A, C, G, T. the number of n-mers that are absent in the sequence follows the classical coupon collector's paradigm [52] the probability that exactly m n-mers are excluded in the random sequence is approximately given by P 0 e e c ( e m c m! ) for large values of t. a small positive c will result in a probability close to one that all n-mers are present while a small negative c will result in gaps in coverage with overwhelming probability. a phase transition in n-mer coverage in the random pseudo-human genome occurs around the critical value of n-mer coverage for actual distribution of nucleotide (or dinucleotide) frequencies is bounded below by the coverage of n-mer space by a uniform random sequence over an alphabet of size 5. the probability 1/5 = 0.2 of selecting a given nucleotide (or probability 1/25 = 0.04 of selecting a given dinucleotide) from an alphabet of size 5 lies below the observed nucleotide frequencies in the human genome. random pseudo-human genomes with nucleotide and dinucleotide frequencies show an essentially complete coverage of n-mers with n up to 13. gaps in coverage occurring abruptly for n-mers of size 14 and beyond. the n-mer coverage of a random pseudo-human genome will manifest themselves in a lower coverage of sequences in n-mer space than can be accounted for by chance. this model is equivalent to a sequence of dinucleotides chosen by independent sampling from the set of sixteen dinucleotides AA, AC,..., TG, TT. this allows a more refined comparison with the human genome in view of features such as the marked depletion of CG dinucle the number of n-mers that are absent in the random sequence follows the classical coupon collector's paradigm [52] the probability that exactly m of the possible n-mers is absent in the random sequence is given by P m = k = 0 4 n m ( 1 ) k ( m + k k ) ( 1 m + k ) ( 1 m + k ) t. probability that all n-mers are present in the sequence is approximately given by P 0 e e c. a small positive c will result in a probability close to one that all n-mers are present while a small negative c will result in gaps in coverage with overwhelming probability. the results are not materially affected if the uniform nucleotide frequencies in the random pseudo-human genome are replaced. random pseudo-human genomes with nucleotide and dinucleotide frequencies matching that of the human genome exhibit an essentially complete coverage of n-mers with n up to 13, with gaps in coverage occurring abruptly for n-mers of size 14 and beyond. n-mer space coverage is bounded below the observed nucleotide frequencies in the human genome. the NCBI genome sequence accession ID for 433 fully sequenced microbial. click here for file (4.6KB, txt) Additional file 2 Supplementary-2. the 10-mer space coverage for 433 fully sequenced microbial with genomes GC content and genome sizes."}
