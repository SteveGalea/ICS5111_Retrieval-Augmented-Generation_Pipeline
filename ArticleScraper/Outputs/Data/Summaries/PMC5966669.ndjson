{"summary": "viral infection involves a large number of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between virus and its targeted host. these interactions range from the initial binding of viral coat proteins to hijack the host transcription machinery by virus proteins. so far, there is no specific vaccine or effective treatment for Ebola virus disease. a recent SVM model called DeNovo can exceptionally predict virus-host PPIs with a shared host. the method is applicable to new viruses or hosts using amino acid repeat patterns and composition. Feature F2 is defined by (2). it appears to be similar to F1, but there are two differences: (1) for F2, the sum of squared length of SARs is computed for every window of size 6 instead of a whole protein sequence. (2) the maximum of the sum of squared length of SAR in a window is selected for F2. with a window of size 6, different patterns of single amino acid repeats lead to 15 different values for feature 2. feature F1 represents the repeat patterns and global composition of amino acids in the whole protein sequence. for feature F3, we partition a protein sequence into 5 segments of equal length except the last one. the second training dataset is composed of PPIs between human and +ssRNA viruses, including HCV and SARS virus. the training dataset was tested on PPIs of new hosts: Mus musculus, Bos taurus, Rattus norvegicus, Sus scrofa, and Escherichia coli. proteins and 116 virus proteins TS7: 125 PPIs between 87 Bos taurus proteins and 34 virus proteins TS8: 86 PPIs between 79 Rattus norvegicus proteins and 24 virus proteins TS10: 78 PPIs between 64 Escherichia coli K-12 proteins and 27 virus proteins. negative dataset includes 2,819 interactions between 90 virus proteins and 2,819 human proteins. several features of proteins have been used to predict PPIs from protein sequences. for each amino acid, we compute its F2 score by selecting the maximum of the sum of squared length of the SAR in a window of size 6: F 2 SAR =. the maximum repeat size of single amino acid repeats is 3, which is observed in the windows starting at 4, 5, 6, 7, 13, 14, and 15. the maximum repeat size of amino acid S is 3, which is observed in the windows starting at 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 13, 14, and 15. a window larger than 6 residues generates a same score for different repeat patterns. first training dataset consists of PPIs of human with positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) viruses except hepatitis C virus (HCV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus. the first training dataset consists of PPIs of human with positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) viruses. training and test datasets constructed in our study can be summarized as follows. training (TR) and test (TS) datasets for Assessing the Applicability of the Prediction Model to new Viruses TR1: 638 PPIs between 499 human proteins and 25 +ssRNA virus proteins TS1: 515 PPIs between 423 human proteins and 11 HCV proteins TS2: 30 PPIs between 27 human proteins and 12 SARS virus proteins TS3: 377 PPI our negative dataset includes 2,819 interactions between 90 virus proteins and 2,819 human proteins. the training and test datasets constructed in this study are available in Additional files 1 and 2. 2.3. False positives (FP) are noninteracting host proteins that are incorrectly predicted as interacting with a virus protein. results of cross validation of the SVM model were performed with several datasets which contain different ratios of positive to negative PPIs between +ssRNA viruses and human. 58.31 97.57 84.48 92.31 82.4 0.646 0.886 3 63.64 96.08 85.27 89.04 84.09 0.661 0.891 mean SD 62.28 2.85 97 0.65 85.42 0.84 91.25 1.57 83.74 0.98 0.67 0.02 0.89 0.00 1 : 3 1 46.24 98.28 85.27 89.94 84.58 0.58 0. a window size of 10 residues is the biggest available window size. but a window size of 6 residues does the same thing for the single amino acid repeat. features Sn (%) Sp (%) Acc (%) PPV (%) NPV (%) MCC AUC F1 81.66 97.02 89.34 96.48 84.10 0.796 0.916 F2 69.75 85.11 77.43 82.41 73.78 0. for features F1 and F2, we tried both single amino acid repeats (SARs) and double amino acid repeats (DARs) along with different partitions of a protein sequence. the results of 10-fold cross validation of SVM model on different combinations of the three features we used in our method. results were obtained by using SAR for features F1 and F2, but with different partitions for feature F3. a protein sequence into 5 segments showed the best performance in all performance measures except sensitivity. a feature vector will require 360 elements (20 elements for F1, 20 elements for F2, and 20 7 = 180 elements for F3 for each of the virus and host proteins) 0.829 0.926 7 partitions 83.60 81.18 82.41 82.30 82.54 0.648 0.907 9 partitions 84.27 79.53 81.95 81.17 82.84 0.639 0.902 Barman dataset F3 Sn (%) Sp (%) Acc (%) PPV (%) NPV (%) MCC AUC 5 partitions 73.72 83.48 78.60 81.69 the average sequence similarity between proteins in TR and those in TS was analyzed using EMBOSS Needle tool [20] to assess the independence of the test data from the training data. target virus proteins in the test datasets showed a very low sequence similarity in the range (3.12% to 5.20%) to the virus proteins in the training datasets. SVM model showed a higher sensitivity (94.37% and 96.67%) for HCV and SARS virus, which are +ssRNA viruses. it is interesting to note that HPV-16 showed the highest specificity of 94.04% and accuracy of 87.93%. the model trained with PPIs of human with +ssRNA viruses was tested on PPIs of five new hosts with the viruses. the average sequence similarity of the human proteins in the training dataset to the new hosts is low, ranging between 8.04% and 9.76%. the SVM model showed the largest area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.959 for the PPIs of E. coli K-12 with viruses. it is interesting to note that proteins of new hosts have a higher average sequence similarity to those in training datasets than proteins of new viruses. this can be explained by the number of partner proteins of the target proteins shared by training and test datasets. we ran our SVM model on the datasets of two other methods for virus-host PPIs: Barman's method [22] and DeNovo [9]. in a 5-fold cross validation with virus-host PPIs from VirusMINT [23], their Random Forest (RF) and SVM showed a better performance. the dataset used for comparison of our SVM model with Barman's SVM and Random Forest models is available in Additional file 5. the dataset used for comparison of our SVM model with DeNovo's SVM model is available in Additional file 5.

Figure 4 shows the ROC curves of independent testing of the SVM model on PPIs of new viruses with human. the SVM model showed the largest area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.970 for the PPIs of the SARS virus with human. the average sequence similarity of the human proteins in the training dataset to the new hosts is low, ranging between 8.04% and 9.76%. despite the low sequence similarity and species difference, testing the model on PPIs of new hosts showed a relatively good performance. model showed the largest area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.959 for the PPIs of E. coli K-12 with viruses. protein of new hosts have a higher average sequence similarity to those in training datasets. but the SVM model showed a lower performance for new hosts. this can be explained by the number of partner proteins of target proteins shared by training and test datasets. 68 (22.1%) 22 (7.4%) 122 (11.6%) Dataset TR2 TS6 TR2 TS7 TR2 TS8 TR2 TS9 TR2 TS10 #PPIs 689 191 689 125 689 86 689 57 689 78 #Virus proteins 35 116 35 34 35 24 35 10 35 27 #Virus proteins common to TR and TS 9 (7.8%) 1 (2.9%) 4 (16.7%) 0 (0.0%) 0 (0.0%) Method Sn (%) Sp (%) Acc (%) PPV (%) NPV (%) MCC AUC F1 (%) Our SVM 73.72 83.48 78.60 81.69 76.06 0.575 0.847 77.50 Barman's SVM 67.00 74.00 71.00 72.00 \u2014 0.440 0.730 69.41 Barman's Random Forest 55.66 89.08 72.41 82.26 \u2014 86.47 86.56 86.39 0.729 0.926 DeNovo's SVM 80.71 83.06 81.90. we tested the prediction model on independent datasets of virus-host PPIs. despite a low sequence similarity between proteins in training datasets, our method outperformed the others. additional file 4: sequence similarity of each protein pair (x, y) for x in the training dataset and y in the test dataset. additional file 5: training and test datasets of virus-host PPIs from deNovo [22]."}
