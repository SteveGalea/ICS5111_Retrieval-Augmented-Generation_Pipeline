{"summary": "in a proportion of patients and animals suffering from disease, no pathogens can be detected using a range of sensitive diagnostic assays. new viruses were identified by standard molecular detection methods, virus replication in tissue culture or animal experiments. in order to discover and characterize new viruses, metagenome sequencing is increasingly being used to identify viral pathogens. a large fraction of the metagenome consists of sequences of other organisms than the viral targets, including host sequences, archaea, bacteria, and bacteriophages. untargeted metagenomic approaches have enabled the identification of numerous newly emerging or previously unidentified viral pathogens. in some cases, the number of reads in the sample is sufficient to permit enough read overlaps to establish longer contiguous sequences (contigs) but direct assembly of complete viral and bacterial genomes from metagenomes can involve a large amount of manual curation. most pathogen genomes are not completely represented by reads and most viral communities are highly diverse. a highly divergent rhabdovirus, called red fox fecal rhabdovirus (RFFRV) was identified during a metagenome survey of feces of red foxes from Spain (Vulpes vulpes) the last metagenome dataset was from a dead Indian python (Python molurus) with pneumonia. it was the first description of a reptile nidovirus (py the resulting singletons and contigs were iteratively assembled by CAP3 until no new contigs were formed. the resulting singletons and contigs were iteratively assembled by CAP3 until no new contigs were formed. BLAST hits were categorized by assigning a taxonomic category. the percentage of viral reads in the sequence datasets and read coverage of the target genome using different assembly methods were determined by mapping trimmed reads to reference genomes with a minimum overlap identity of 80%. pfam02723, pfam01601, pfam01600, pfam00937, pfam08779, pfam12383, pfam12379, pfam12133, pfam12124, pfam12093, pfam11501, pfam11395, pfam11289, pfam10943, pfam09401, pfam06 the first metagenome dataset was obtained from a cell culture supernatant (CCS) containing a rhabdovirus-like virus isolated from tissue collected from a white-beaked dolphin (Lagenorhynchus albirostris) it was closely related to rhabdoviruses of the genera Perhabdovirus and Vesiculovirus found in fish (Siegers et al., 1993; Siegers et al., 2014) a reptile nidovirus (python nidovirus, PNV) and phylogenetic analysis placed this virus in the subfamily Torovirinae. these datasets were acquired using a random sequence amplification and deep sequencing approach on a 454 GS Junior instrument (Roche) full-length genomes (DRV) or expected complete coding sequences (PNV, RFFRV) are available. omics Workbench 6.0.4 assembler (CLC bio, Aarhus, Denmark) was run with 40 iterations and otherwise default values. newbler 2.5 (Roche) was run with default values. pfam14314, pfam00945, pfam02484, pfam03216, pfam03342, pfam03397, pfam04785, pfam05554, pfam00922, pfam00974, pfam06326) were used to search the translated contigs of the metagenome datasets with rhabdoviruses with HMMER3.1. pfam03620, pfam03617, pfam03187, pfam03187, pfam01635, pfam09399, pfam01831, were used to search the translated contigs of the PNV metagenome. the best scoring detected motif distributed over the seed contig was then used to search the motif in the collection of all contigs longer than 500 bases. the three 454-sequencing datasets obtained from a CCS, a red fox fecal (RFF) metagenome, and a tiger python lung tissue (TPLT) metagenome contained 69,358, 56,174, and 135,812 sequence reads. these reads were analyzed with an automatic analysis pipeline that included stringent quality and length trimming, exhaustive iterative assembly, and low complexity filtering. unassigned 0.04 0.19 0.97 Virus 68.05 30.21 0.72 Unknown 3.90 10.35 49.39 Eukaryota 27.40 37.90 35.22 Bacteria 0.61 21.34 13.64 Archea 0 0 0.06 Taxonomic composition per read in percentage of cell culture supernatant. retrospective mapping of reads to the viral target genomes showed that a large percentage of the sequences identified as \u201cunknowns\u201d were actually derived from the target genome. panels contain information on read coverage and contigs matching the viral genomes of DRV (A), RFFRV (B), and PNV (C), produced by different assembly algorithms. the contigs were assembled from trimmed reads by iterative assembly and iterative assembly. a very small overlap of only five nucleotides between position 4356 and 4356. a 24.7 kb contig had a stretch with an average identity of 29% amino acid identity to the replicase polyprotein of Berne virus, subfamily Torovirinae. this contig was used as seed contig. for further analysis we used the set of contigs produced by iterative assembly. a combination of different assembly algorithms may result in a higher level of completeness of target genomes if not complete genome assembly. the TPLT metagenome did not give any hits. for Coronaviridae in the TPLT metagenome, 44 HMMs were present in PFAM. however, in all three datasets, all identified domains were already identified in contigs with BLAST sequence homology to a closely related virus. contigs were selected if they contained one or several occurrences of the motif at an e-value smaller than 0.01. in the TLPT metagenome, four additional RFFRV contigs were identified. in the TLPT metagenome, one additional PNV contig exhibited the detected pattern (Figures 1B\u2013C) coverage of each contig of (A) of cell culture supernatant containing Dolphin rhabdovirus, (B) red fox feces containing red fox fecal rhabdovirus and (C) python lung tissue containing python nidovirus. the first bar in the last panel is truncated for visibility (47%). shown are only contigs larger than 1 kb. coverage profile binning identified additional contigs in two of the datasets. low ranking contigs have a similar k-mer frequency profile as the seed contig, while high ranking contigs differ in their k-mer frequency profile. k-mer frequency ranking identified an additional part of DRV, and two large RFFRV contigs. all high-ranking contigs were unrelated to PNV. the analysis showed a high variety among almost all taxonomic categories in the three different datasets. the overall viral content determined by homology search was relatively low (0.72%) in dataset 3 (TPLT metagenome), and high (30.21 and 68.05%) in datasets 1 and 2 (CCS and RFF metagenome, Table 2). CCS RFF TPLT Total number of reads 69358 56174 135812 Assembled metagenome (%) 40.67 57.78 36.83 Reads identified by homology search as obtained from target virus (%) 27.67 iterative exhaustive assembly resulted in assembled metagenomes containing between 40\u201360% of the original total amount of obtained reads. the viromes of the RFF metagenome showed a much smaller percentage of the RFFRV indicating the presence of multiple different viruses. small black boxes mark stretches of low sequence complexity. \"ORF\" indicates the genome organization as described below. \"BLAST\" shows regions with sequence homology as determined by BLASTX. large contigs (>1 kb) produced by iterative assembly covered the target genomes more completely than any other set of contigs obtained with other assembly algorithms. none of the assemblers tested here was able to completely assemble the viral genomes from the reads into a single contig. iterative assembly seems to perform best in terms of production of large contigs and coverage of target genomes compared to other assemblers. however, using different assembly algorithms may result in a higher level of completeness of target genomes if not complete genome assembly. remote homology search In absence of BLAST-detectable sequence homology to previously described viruses for some stretches of the target genomes we attempted to use methods that are able to detect remote homologs. motif search A sequence motif is a DNA pattern that occurs repeatedly in a genome or in a group of related sequences. the highest scoring motif was then used to screen all available contigs of the deep sequencing datasets. the e-value for the respective other rhabdovirus genome was relatively low (0.62 and 0.015), suggesting those motifs might be conserved among both rhabdovirus genomes. the detection sensitivity was restricted by the number of contigs that contained the motif. in the TPLT metagenome, the seed contig of RFFRV was covered by 0.5 reads per base. in the TPLT metagenome, the seed contig of RFFRV was covered by 0.5 reads per base. low ranking contigs have a similar k-mer frequency profile as the seed contig. the two largest contigs (>3.5 kb) of RFFRV had the highest rank when compared to the frequency profile of the seed contig. the retrospective nature of this study allowed us to compare the success of the strategies in retrieving three novel viral genomes from 454 metagenome data. a growing number of metagenome studies apply other next-generation sequencing techniques (e.g., Illumina), but 454 sequencing is still widely applied in viral metagenome studies. common random amplification methods are known to produce strong amplification biases leading to highly uneven coverage depths. coverage profile binning was successfully applied to assemble viral genomes across a number of human gut metagenomes without the need of a reference. many metagenome assemblers to date were designed to handle short-read data. only very few assemblers are dedicated to assembly of longer reads without any further information such as paired-end or mate-pair information. none of these strategies lead to a full reconstruction of the genomes of the novel viruses. the strategies described in this study can aid in identification of missing segments or contigs. the strategy with the highest specificity was de novo motif discovery in the seed contig and subsequent motif search in all contigs of the assembled metagenome. the development of more efficient and dedicated metagenome assemblers will lead to improved retrieval of viral pathogen genomes from metagenome sequences. the number of identified target virus reads and the level of viral genome completeness can be increased by combining data generated with different assembly algorithms. authors were involved in the revision of the draft manuscript and have agreed to the final content. conflict of interest statement Drs.
