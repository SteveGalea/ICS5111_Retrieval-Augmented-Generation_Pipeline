{"summary": "members of the genus Orthoreovirus contain 10 genome segments. they have been isolated from a wide range of mammalian, avian and reptilian hosts. orthoreoviruses are divided into two subgroups fusogenic and nonfusogenic. a patient with acute influenza-like illness was investigated in 2006. there was no associated dyspnoea, tachypnoea, haemoptysis or chest pain on coughing. there was no associated dyspnoea, tachypnoea, haemoptysis or chest pain on coughing. the vomitus consisted of food taken and was not bile-stained. the stool was described as watery without excessive mucous and it was non-malenic. his illness was not relieved with self-medication of antipyretics. a throat swab was taken from the index case patient (S1) and sent in viral transport medium (VTM) to the national public health laboratory for virus isolation. a syncytial cytopathic effect (CPE) was noted in MDCK and Vero cells, but not in Hep-2 cells. CK cells were able to replicate and cause syncytial CPE in all types of mammalian cell-lines available in the laboratory. the virus was named Kampar virus (KamV) after the location of the index case. due to the similar CPE morphology (Figure 1) and cell line susceptibility patterns between KamV and Melaka virus (MelV), immunofluorescent antibody testing was conducted to examine cross reactivity. mango trees, coconut palms and natural wild fruiting trees are found around his house and between neighbouring houses. a tall fruiting mango tree is planted close to the house which is of less than three feet from the side wall of the house. fruit bats were noted to use this mango tree to feed on the ripened mangoes. venous blood samples were taken from his wife (S3) and the doctor (S2) who examined him on august 21. all sera were tested for the presence of antibodies against KamV. the index case patient showed the highest level of IgG antibodies. a four way cross-neutralization was conducted as described in the Materials and Methods. it is clear that all of the four viruses share significant antigenic relatedness as evident from the cross-neutralization activities of each serum. the failure of any of the four sera to neutralize the control virus, mammalian reovirus 3 (MRV3), and of the MRV3 serum to neutralize any of the four viruses confirmed the specificity of the assay. genome segments encoded by the four small (S) genome segments of these viruses are very similar in size and share significant levels of sequence identity. one S-class genome segment of orthoreoviruses may be polycistronic, and its coding arrangement is used as a useful molecular marker for differentiation of different species groups. phylogenetic trees of orthoreoviruses based on deduced amino acid sequence of the major inner capsid or sigma 1 (A) and outer capsid or sigma 2 (B) proteins. in 2006, a patient with acute influenza-like illness was investigated in Kampar, a town in the north-western part of peninsular Malaysia. he developed sudden onset of high fever with chills and rigor. there was no associated dyspnoea, tachypnoea, haemoptysis or chest pain on coughing. a provisional diagnosis of influenza-like illness was made at which he was given a higher dose of anti-pyretic. his white blood cell and platelet counts were within normal limits although there was a relative lymphopenia in the blood sample taken at first examination. subject 1 (S1) was well until 19 august 2006 when he developed high fever with chills and rigor. he had generalized body aches, myalgia and severe malaise. on the following day, he developed nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. he sought medical treatment at the government health clinic in Kampar. a provisional diagnosis of influenza-like illness was made at which he was given a higher dose of anti-pyretic. his illness was noted to resolve on 23 August 2006 although he still appeared weak and lethargic. a throat swab was taken from the index case patient (S1) and sent in viral transport medium (VTM) to the national public health laboratory for virus isolation. after 3 days of culturing, a syncytial cytopathic effect (CPE) was noted in all types of mammalian cell-lines available in the laboratory inclusive of C6/36 (ATCC CRL-1660) cell-line which is of mosquito cell in origin. panels A and B are mock and MelV infected cells stained with human anti-MelV serum. panels C and D are mock and MelV infected cells probed with human anti-KamV serum. a preliminary survey of bat sera collected in peninsular Malaysia indicated a low prevalence of KamV-specific antibodies in at least two different bat species. it is not clear at the present time whether KamV is carried by a specific fruit bat species or by multiple bat species circulating in the region. a four way cross-neutralization was conducted to establish the antigenic relationship between KamV and three other known orthoreoviruses in the NBV species group. the failure of any of the four sera to neutralize any of the four viruses confirmed the specificity of the assay. the close genetic relationship between KamV and MelV was confirmed by the comparison of genome segment mobility or electropherotypes using SDS-PAGE. the genetic relatedness of KamV and three other viruses in the NBV species group was further corroborated by molecular characteristics. phylogenetic trees based on deduced amino acid sequences of the major outer capsid protein and the major inner capsid protein are shown in Figure 5A and 5B, respectively. it is evident that KamV is a close member of the NBV species. similar trees were obtained based on other proteins (data not shown) phylogenetic trees of orthoreoviruses based on deduced amino acid sequence of the major inner capsid or sigma 1 (A) and outer capsid or sigma 2 (B) proteins are given in brackets next to the abbreviated virus name. a large number of new coronaviruses have been detected in many different bat species. a large number of new coronaviruses have been detected in many different bat species. it is important to conduct similar serological and virological surveillance studies for bat orthoreoviruses to better understand their geographic distribution. the partial S segment sequences of a new orthoreovirus were made available in the GenBank by a group in Hong Kong. reovirus strain HK23629/07 was isolated from a patient suffering an acute respiratory infection. phylogenetic analysis of the available sequences confirmed that the HK strain is very closely related to other members of the NBV group. the discovery and characterization of KamV corroborate our previous work on MelV. this further highlights the urgent need to systematically survey bat-borne viruses in the international community. IFAT and virus neutralization assay were conducted as previously described. infected cells were harvested, washed four times and suspended in sterile PBS. aliquot of the infected cell suspension was carefully spotted onto each well of Teflon coated slides. serial 2-fold dilutions of serum samples were then added to detect specific reactivity. sequence information was obtained by PCR using primers designed from conserved regions of MelV, PulV and NBV. the majority of sequence information was obtained by PCR with primers designed from conserved regions of MelV, PulV and NBV. a two-step PCR strategy was used to obtain the genome segment terminal sequences. supernatant from cultures with visible syncytial cytopathic effect (CPE) after 3 days was taken for further analysis by serial passage in different cell lines available in the laboratory. the investigation conducted in this study was approved by the ethics committee of the Malaysian National Public Health Laboratory. pre-incubated virus/serum mix was added to confluent cell monolayers. monolayers washed three times with PBS and cell media replaced. ability of sera to neutralize virus was determined by scoring extent of CPE observed in duplicate wells three days later. in GenBank under accession numbers EU448334 to EU4488337 for S1, S2, S3 and S4 segments."}
