{"summary": "more than 70% of emerging infectious disease agents are caused by microbes jumping from animals into humans. this has been well exemplified by the highly fatal human infection due to avian influenza A H5N1 in 1997. the human SARS coronavirus was traced to caged civets in the market. the sampling of live animals were approved under permit no. 1048-05 (bats and monkeys) and 2284-10 (stray dogs and cats) all sampling were performed by licensed veterinarians. anesthesia was given where appropriate; every effort was made to minimize suffering. rectal swabs were collected from bats with medium-moistened cotton swab immersed in viral transport medium. the samples were collected for a routine surveillance study by AFCD. the strays dogs and strays cats were kept at AFCD under standard facilities. sample preparation The viral transport medium (in which the rectal swab specimens were immersed) were pooled, 100 l each, and centrifuged at 10000g for 5 min. the supernatant was then filtered through a 0.22 m filter (Millipore) the filtrates were treated with DNaseI (Roche) and RNaseA (QIAGEN) analysis of sequence reads Sequences were trimmed based on quality score of 99.9%. any sequences less than 30 bp long were deleted using 454 duplicate clustering workflows based on the CDHIT program. genomes and the nr database from NCBI using tBLASTx and BLASTx, respectively, with an E-value cutoff of 105 to assign taxonomy. specific primers were designed to fill the gaps for the completion of this viral genome. only the early (E) ORFs E1 and E2 and the late (L) ORFs L1 and L2 were included as only these ORFs are ubiquitous present in all characterized PVs. theoretical isoelectric points and molecular masses were estimated using BLASTP. sample collection was performed in strict accordance with local ordinance. the sampling of live animals were approved under permit no. 1048-05 (bats and monkeys) and 2284-10 (stray dogs and cats) all sampling were performed by licensed veterinarians. rectal swabs were collected from bats with medium-moistened cotton swab immersed in viral transport medium. the samples were collected for a routine surveillance study by AFCD. the strays dogs and strays cats were kept at AFCD under standard facilities. sample preparation The viral transport medium (in which the rectal swab specimens were immersed) were pooled, 100 l each, centrifuged at 10000g for 5 min. the supernatant was then filtered through a 0.22 m filter (Millipore) the filtrates were treated with DNaseI (Roche) and RNaseA (QIAGEN) sequences were trimmed based on quality score of 99.9%. any sequences less than 30 bp long were deleted using 454 duplicate clustering workflows.

JQ692938. the majority of the viral-like sequences were similar to single-stranded, negative-sense, circular DNA viruses, with the largest proportion of the sequences showing homology to porcine circovirus. not assigned contains those reads that are not assigned by the least common ancestor algorithm. the complete genome of MscPV1 was 7,531 bp in length with a G+C content of 45.8%. the MscPV1 genome contains the typical PV ORFs. the MscPV1 E7 contained one slightly modified domain (CXXCX30CXXC) but no pRB-binding domain (LXCXE) [37]. the E1 ORF codes for the largest MscPV1 protein (669 aa) phylogenetic analysis confirms that MscPV1 forms a genetic lineage that is distinct from previously reported PVs with complete genome. comparison of L1 gene showed that MscPV1 had 60% nucleotide and 58.6% amino acid identity to the closest related PV, Canine papillomavirus 6. caretta caretta papillomavirus; CgPV, Colobus guereza papillomavirus; CPV, canine papillomavirus; EePV, Erinaceus europaeus papillomavirus; FdPV, Fringilla coelebs papillomavirus; FdPV, francolinus leucoscepus papillomavirus; Virusa GenBank accession no Genus L1 L2 E1 E2 nt aa nt aa nt aa nt aa CPV6 FJ492744 Lambda 60.0 58.6 45.7 35.4 54.9 44.4 48.0 40.3 CPV1 D55633 Lambda 59.2 57.4 47.8 37. 3.2 48.7 41.3 PlpPV1 AY904724 Lambda 59.2 59.5 45.4 37.3 52.7 42.4 47.8 39.4 PlPV1 AY763115 Lambda 59.0 59.1 46.4 36.9 54.5 46.1 51.0 45.3 EdPV1 AY684126 Sigma 58.9 58.3 44.5 32.0 49.9 37.4 45.5 34.6 FdPV1 AF480 the majority of the viral-like sequences were similar to single-stranded, negative-sense, circular DNA viruses. the next large group of the sequences matched to another member of the Circoviridae family, torque teno virus. teno sus virus 1 and torque teno canis virus shared homology to canary circovirus, anellovirus and densovirus. the majority of these sequences were related to porcine circovirus in animal samples. these hits cover about 70% of the viral genome. us schreibersii papillomavirus type 1 (MscPV1) contains two conserved zinc binding domains (CXXCX29CXXC), separated by 36 amino acids. the E1 ORF codes for the largest MscPV1 protein (669 aa) the MscPV1 gene is located in the E region and overlaps with E2. downstream from the leucine-rich region is a proline-rich region. both L1 and L2 contain a series of arginine and lysine residues. MscPV1 shared only 52.4% nucleotide identity to another PV isolated from an Egyptian fruit bat. it represents the first member of a novel PV genus, Dyolambda-papillomavirus. inus leucoscepus papillomavirus; HPV, Human papillomavirus; LrPV, Lynx rufus papillomavirus; MaPV, Mesocricetus auratus papillomavirus; MmiPV, Macaca fascicularis papillomavirus; MmiPV, micromys minutus papillomavirus; MnPV, mul Virusa GenBank accession no Genus L1 L2 E1 E2 nt aa nt aa nt aa nt aa nt aa nt aa nt aa CPV6 FJ492744 Lambda 60.0 58.6 45.7 35.4 54.9 44.4 48.0 40.3 CPV1 D55633 Lambda 59.2 57.4 47.8 37 PV1 DQ180494 Lambda 58.8 58.4 45.3 38.2 52.5 42.9 47.1 40.5 SfPV1 K02708 Kappa 58.7 55.9 43.7 31.8 51.5 40.8 44.7 35.6 LrPV1 AY904722 Lambda 58.6 58.4 45.0 36.4 53.5 46.0 47.8 39.2 HPV41 X56147 Nu 58.1 56.4 43.8 34.1 the advent of high-throughput sequencing has allowed the discovery of many novel animal viruses such as porcine circoviruses, astroviruses and bocaviruses. the advent of high-throughput sequencing has allowed the discovery of many novel animal viruses such as novel species of porcine circoviruses. the second bat PV, MscPV1, with only 52.4% nucleotide identity to the Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus) papillomavirus RaPV1. compared to other PVs, the highest nucleotide and amino acid identities were only 60% and 58.6%. BPV6, CPV2, CPV7, CcaPV1, HPV4, HPV65, HPV95 and HPV116 exhibit the classical CXXCX29CXXC motif. the E1 of MscPV1 contains the conserved ATP-binding site of the ATP-dependent helicase. in comparison, the motif is GPPNTGKS in EdPV1 and CPV6, and GPSDTGKS in HPV41. a more recent study showed that recombination of PV contributes significantly to the evolution of PV. this is concordant with the current study, in which nucleotide and amino acid sequence analysis showed a higher degree of similarity between our novel MscPV1 and EdPV1 in north american porcupine. however, our findings may only represent an additional exception and do not refute the generalization that PVs evolve mainly by co-evolution with hosts. M. schreibersii is a cave-dwelling bat with body weight ranged from 11 to 18 g. it roosts in abandoned mines, water tunnels, drainage and weep holes of the water catchment. it is considered as common and widespread throughout Hong Kong countryside. tree constructed by PhyML using E1 was used to estimate divergence times in MEGA5.
