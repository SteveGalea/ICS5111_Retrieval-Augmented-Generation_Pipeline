{"summary": "the most recognized inflammatory disease is HTLV-1\u2013associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) patients with HAM/TSP exhibit higher HTLV-1 proviral load in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) than asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers ( 14, 15 ). HTLV-1\u2013specific CTLs are thought to be a key factor in the pathogenesis of HAM/TSP ( 18, 19 ). skinner et al visualized antigen-specific T cells with nonfrozen tissues. method has not been adapted to frozen tissue samples. fresh-frozen spinal cord samples were cut into 8-m-thick sections. the sections were incubated with a primary monoclonal antibody (mAb) for 60 minutes at room temperature. the sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and analyzed by light microscopy. sections were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C in the presence of proteinase inhibitors. sections were fixed with PBS-buffered 0.1% PFA for 10 minutes and washed with PBS after each step. sections were incubated with goat anti-rabbit Ab labeled with Alexa Fluor 488. sections were incubated with any of anti-CD8 mAb, anti\u2013granzyme B mAb, anti\u2013interferon- (IFN-) mAb, or Lt-4 mAb. sections were incubated with rabbit anti-PE Ab for 60 minutes at RT. immunodominant epitopes are restricted to HLA-A*02 and HLA-A*24. the cells were also detected with dUTP nick end labeling method. sections were incubated with a primary monoclonal antibody (mAb) for 60 minutes at RT. sections were treated with 3% H 2 O 2 in PBS for 20 minutes. sections were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase\u2013labeled polymer-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Ab) reagent. etramer or HLA-A*2402/Tax301-309-tetramer (MBL, Japan) diluted to 1.0 g/mL. sections were fixed with PBS-buffered 0.1% PFA for 10 minutes. sections were incubated with tetramer overnight at 4\u00b0C. Detection of HTLV-1\u2013Infected Cells in the Tissues Fresh-frozen spinal cord sections were used to detect HTLV-1 proteins. sections were dried and fixed with 4% PFA for 20 minutes at RT. cells were detected with anti\u2013active caspase-3 Ab or anti\u2013single-stranded DNA Ab. myelin pallor in Luxol fast blue staining was observed in the affected long tracts, lateral cerebrospinal fasciculus, ventral and dorsal spinocerebellar fasciculi, spinothalamic fasciculus in the lateral column, and fasciculus gracilis in the posterior columns. the essential histopathologic feature was a chronic progressive inflammatory process with marked parenchymal exudation of lymphocytes and macrophage cerebellar fasciculus, lateral spinothalamic fasciculus in the lateral column (arrowhead), anterior spinothalamic fasciculus in the anterior column (thick arrow), and fasciculus gracilis in the posterior column (thin arrow) there is marked atrophy, particularly of the lateral column. we could not detect HTLV-1\u2013specific CTLs at all with tax-tetramer or -pentamer in frozen samples using a reported procedure for nonfrozen samples. we tested several modified staining procedures and finally found that prefixing the frozen sections at a very low concentration of PFA was optimal. PBMCs from a patient with HAM/TSP are stained with the tetramer. HLA-A*0201/Tax11-19-tetramer\u2013positive cells are scattered in the spinal cord parenchyma (Patient 8624) cells stained with the tetramer are found around the vessel in the spinal cord leptomeninges (red) tax-specific CTLs in CD8-positive cells were 22.1% (62 of 280) and 31.1% (96 of 309) in patients with HLA-A*02\u2013positive and HLA-A*24\u2013positive patients. the fluorescence of Tax-pentamer exactly colocalized with that of anti-CD8 mAb. the frequency of tax-pentamer\u2013positive cells in CD8-positive cells was 31% in the lesion. HTLV-1\u2013specific CTLs are observed in the parenchyma and comprise 29% of CD8-positive cells in the field. the CTLs comprise 25% of CD8-positive cells in the field. HTLV-1 gene has been detected in CD4-positive lymphocytes. but its viral protein has not been detected in freshly isolated lymphocytes. HTLV-1 tax showed a patchy staining pattern in the nuclei of a human cell line. the HTLV-1\u2013positive cells in infiltrating CD4-positive cells were 60.3% and 82.4% in patients 8624 and 6315. more than 50% of infiltrating cells were infected with HTLV-1. HTLV-1\u2013infected cells had a greater tendency to undergo apoptosis. double staining for HTLV-1 Env (green) and HTLV-1 Tax (red) revealed that both proteins were detected separately in the same cells. the nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. white bars indicate 20 m. functional Molecules of HTLV-1\u2013Specific CD8-positive CTLs. double staining with HLA-A*2402/Tax301-309-tetramer (green) and anti\u2013granzyme B monoclonal antibody (mAb) (red) reveals a GzB-positive HTLV-1\u2013specific CTL in the parenchyma of the spinal cord. a cell expressing HTLV-1 tax protein is in contact with a CD8-positive cell in the spinal cord of Patient 8614. spase-3 was detected in the cell cytoplasm in those samples. the 3 staining methods showed frequent apoptosis in the spinal cord. some small cells are apoptotic (DAB; brown, arrowheads) detected by anti\u2013active caspase-3 antibody. double staining revealed that apoptotic cells were CD4-positive or CD68-positive cells. oligodendrocytes were not stained with anti-HTLV-1 Tax mAb. this finding is consistent with the occurrence of demyelination in the spinal cords of HAM/TSP patients. double staining with anti-CNPase mAb (green) and anti-HLA-ABC mAb (red) revealed no oligodendrocyte expresses HLA-ABC. there is no double-positive signal (yellow) in merged image. patients with HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) showed marked atrophy in the lateral columns; original magnification is 40. a number of infiltrating cells are scattered throughout the section of the spinal cord. HTLV-1 tax\u2013specific CTLs in the CNS were counterstained with hematoxylin. PBMCs of HAM/TSP were fixed on slides and stained with tetramer. the fluorescence pattern of the tetramer exactly colocalized with that of anti-CD8 mAb on the PBMCs. no cells were detected by HIV Gag-tetramer and influenza-tetramer as tetramer controls. double staining with anti-CD8 monoclonal antibody (red) and HLA-A*0201/Tax11-19 tetramer (green) was performed with confocal laser scanning microscopy. HTLV-1 tax-specific CTLs stained with tax-tetramer were frequently noted in the lesions. double staining revealed that the fluorescence of Tax-tetramer colocalized with that of anti-CD8 mAb in all 3 patients. double staining with anti-CD8 monoclonal antibody (mAb) (red) and HLA-A*0201/Tax11-19 or HLA-A*2402/Tax301-309 tetramer (green) was performed with confocal laser scanning microscopy. DAPI (blue) was used for counterstaining the nuclei. no cells are stained with the tetramer. fluorescence of the HLA-A*02/Tax11-19 pentamer is colocalized with that of CD8. percentage of tax pentamer\u2013positive cells in CD8-positive cells is 31% of the cells in the field. tax was found in the cells near vessels and in the leptomeninges. the nuclear protein showed a patchy staining pattern in the nuclei. Env and Gag were detected in the cell membrane or cytoplasm. double staining revealed that the cells expressing Tax, Env, or Gag were CD4-positive lymphocytes. infected cells were undergoing apoptosis in patient 8624. cells expressing HTLV-1 tax protein were found near the vessels of the spinal cord of patient 6315. double staining for CD4 (purple) and HTLV-1 Tax (green) revealed that HTLV-1 Env is costained with CD4 on the cell surface. FN-\u2013positive cells were detected in both parenchymal and perivascular areas. double staining revealed that CD8-positive cells sometimes were in contact with HTLV-1\u2013infected cells. human T-lymphotropic virus type-1 tax\u2013specific CTLs were not positive for Ki-67. active caspase-3\u2013positive cells were frequently observed near CD8-positive cells in the parenchyma of the spinal cord. some of them were in contact with CD8-positive cells in the parenchyma of the spinal cord. apoptotic cells (DAB; brown) are detected in the spinal cord of a patient with HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (Patient 8624) the apoptotic cells are barely detectable in the control spinal cord from an HTLV-1\u2013seronegative patient with hepatoma. a higher magnification picture in the inset shows apoptotic cells. neurons identified by their size as well as several particles within the neuronal body induced strong autofluorescence but were not positive for active caspase-3. apoptotic cells were stained with anti\u2013glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) antibody (Ab), anti\u20132\u2032,3\u2032-cyclic-nucleotide 3\u2019-phosphodiesterase (mAb) or anti\u2013active caspase-3 Ab, respectively, in the spinal cord of Patient 8624 HTLV-1 tax11-19\u2013specific and HTLV-1 tax301-309\u2013specific CTLs were detected in PBMCs. the frequency of HTLV-1 tax\u2013specific CTLs was higher in CSF than in PBMCs. oligodendrocytes underwent apoptosis in the affected lesions. infected CD4-positive T cells, but not oligodendrocytes, are the main targets of HTLV-1\u2013specific CTLs in the CNS. an interaction between these infected CD4-positive cells and CTLs may cause bystander damage in oligodendrocytes that is associated with demyelination. HTLV-1\u2013infected cells can express viral antigens anywhere in the body of the infected individuals. this is consistent with previous reports in which HTLV-1\u2013infected cells were determined to be CD4-positive lymphocytes in the CNS by in situ hybridization for HTLV-1 mRNA and in situ polymerase chain reaction for HTLV-1 DNA.
