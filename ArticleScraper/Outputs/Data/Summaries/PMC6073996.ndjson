{"summary": "occupationally-acquired infection of laboratory personnel is referred to as a laboratory-acquired infection (LAI) there has been growing concern in the global scientific community and the general public regarding the potential for bioterrorism and accidental escape of pathogens from research laboratories. the study used online search engines including PubMed, Google, google, and the American Biological Safety Association (ABSA) LAI database to locate open sources of information on LAI reports or publications. the study aimed to summarize LAI reports from the Asia-Pacific region and to raise awareness of laboratory personnel of their occupational health and safety risks. the database was restricted to papers published in English up to 22 February 2018, combining the search terms \u2018Asia\u2019, \u2018Pacific\u2019 and \u2018zoonosis\u2019, \u2018veterinary\u2019 and \u2018laboratory-acquired infection\u2019 or \u2018accidental infection\u2019. the full texts of located articles were assessed to determine their suitability for inclusion. unknown Graduate student Research 2006 PR China Seoul virus and hantavirus (Z) Possible aerosol 8 postgraduate students

33% (9/27) and fungi for 7% (2/27) of LAIs. the most commonly reported pathogens causing LAIs were dengue virus (3 reports), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (3 reports), Brucella spp. (3 reports), Arthroderma spp. (2 reports), Mycobacterium spp. (2 reports), Ricke the risk of infection is greatly increased by necropsy procedures, sample collection, clinical treatment, sample processing, and in vitro propagation. examples of emerging and zoonotic infectious diseases of high risk potential in Asia-Pacific region are presented in Table 2. existing wild type H5N1 viruses were reported to have a limited ability for human to human transmission. the risk of the viruses crossing species boundaries to become a pandemic threat in humans was considered to be low [25,26]. a HPAI H5N1 strains, first detected in china in 2008, had undergone genetic re-assortment resulting in new NA subtypes (including N2, N3, N5, N6, and N8). of 167 potential Brucella-exposed workers, 71 developed LAI brucellosis. brucellosis is endemic in the Asia-Pacific region. predicted prevalence of the disease in livestock ranges between 3% for South East Asia and 16% for South Asia. major transboundary livestock diseases including swine fever virus (CSFV), foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV), porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome (PRRS) are also endemic in South and Southeast Asia requiring laboratory diagnosis, propagation, and certain conditions increasing the risk of accidental exposures and release. students Research 2004 Taiwan Dengue type 1 Mosquito bite

viruses have recently caused disease outbreaks in poultry in Malaysia during 2017 [20] and Cambodia, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan during January 2018 [21] a HPAI H5N1 strain was first detected in china in 2008. the virus recurred annually and caused 1589 human cases with 616 deaths. it is unclear how mutation and re-assortment occur in nature. rabies has been estimated to infect as many as 31,000 humans annually in Asia [37] in india alone, there were approximately 20,000 cases annually, which was one-third of the rabies cases reported worldwide. high disease prevalence combined with increased exposure risk through diagnostic activities with poor biosafety practices could increase the potential of LAIs to laboratory personnel. high-pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) viruses have recently caused disease outbreaks in poultry in Malaysia during 2017 [20] and Cambodia, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan during January 2018 [21]. animal disease surveillance and monitoring activities have been routinely performed throughout Asia with a focus on HPAI virus and other transboundary diseases that affect international trade. viruses recurred annually and caused 1589 human cases with 616 deaths. it is unclear how mutation and re-assortment occur in nature. there is a possibility that these viruses could undergo genetic assortment and infect humans leading to a potential pandemic strain. pre-exposure vaccination, good laboratory practices, effective biosafety measures, and post-exposure prophylaxis treatment are key to protecting those who work with the rabies virus. zoonotic pathogens of viral origin have recently emerged or are endemic in South Asia, Southeast Asia and Oceania. a series of landmark studies of LAI occurrence and cause were performed in the USA by Sulkin and Pike between 1935\u20131978. the majority of LAIs were caused by bacterial pathogens with lower numbers of viral and rickettsial infections. however, these were based mostly on LAIs from research and animal laboratories. lack of awareness could result in low or no LAI reporting in some laboratories. lack of awareness could result in low or no LAI reporting in some laboratories. a registry documenting the near-miss incidents would help to improve laboratory safety. a literature review of LAI reports in the USA during 2000\u20132009 revealed that there was a total of 34 cases with four deaths. there were six cases of brucellosis, four cases of Francisella tularensis and one case of Coccidioides immitis/posadasii. a risk-based approach should be applied for all biosafety programs focusing on pathogen-based factors. the factors to be considered are routes of infection, infectious dose, quantity and concentration of the agent. annual health checks and vaccinations, post-exposure prophylaxis and symptom monitoring are recommended."}
