{"summary": "the combination of large population sizes, very short generation times, and lack of proof-reading mechanisms during genome replication confer viral populations with an extremely high evolutionary plasticity. this tremendous evolvability coupled with densely populated animal and plant susceptible hosts are the reasons for the persistence and emergence of new viral diseases. this cloud of mutants is usually known as a viral quasi-species and it constitutes the target of selection, instead of the individual viral genomes. mutation is often modelled as a \u2018flow\u2019 between populations of initial wt individuals and emerging mutant individuals [18\u201321] in the mathematical theory of population genetics, mutation is often modelled as a \u2018flow\u2019 between populations of initial wt individuals and emerging mutant individuals [18\u201321]. a number of studies employ fitness to investigate the survival of a population in dynamical systems that present competition or coexistence. the evolution of virulence for coexisting viral strains has received great attention from theoreticians. many of the models brought forward to explain the evolution of virulence take into consideration the processes of coinfection and superinfection. this approach is to illustrate the conditions for coexistence of viral strains that consider both a wt viral strain and its mutants. the bifurcation analysis is based on a nonlinear system of five ordinary differential equations. the model is based on a nonlinear system of five ordinary differential equations. the model is based on a nonlinear system of five ordinary differential equations. w mutation from wt to mutant w y w = w z w x growth of wt infected cells. decay of wt infected cells 2.1b y w = w z w x growth of wt infected cells. z i = i i y i lytic release of type i virions by infection i z i, degradation of type i virions with the wt strains infect the host cells at rates m and w respectively. the model is based on the same assumptions of the classic Lotka\u2013Volterra equations. the main role of infected cells is viewed in the scope of the processes of the lytic cycle. the absence of a mechanism for virus replication makes multiplication of viral strains entirely dependent on the machinery of the infected cells. however, the overall number of virions produced in one lytic cycle must be proportional to the virulence and the number of virions produced by a single-infected cell. non-dimensionalization The model (2.1) can be simplified by introducing dimensionless variables that are based on characteristic timescales and population sizes. the quantity describes the effective growth rate of uninfected cells and its inverse, ( )1 is used to define the characteristic time scale of

understand how the dynamics change under parameter variation. the second equilibrium v 1 := x = 1, y m = 0, y w = 0, z m = 0, z w = 0. 3.2 describes, whenever stable, a virus-free state whereby only the uninfected cells persist. the maximum population of uninfected cells is equal to one. the coexistence state v3 can only be biologically meaningful if the burst size of wt strain satisfies > w(1 + /w) this inequality is a generalization of that derived for the mutant virus (m 1) which accounts for mutation. directional mutation prevents the existence of an equilibrium point that is analogous to v2 whereby only the wt virus exists. linear stability analysis is carried out to determine the behaviour of the system close to the equilibrium points. the polynomial det ( v 1 ) I = 0 can be regrouped into the form of three factors P 1 ( ) P 2 ( ) = 0, where P 1 ( ) = + 1, 3.7a P 2 ( ) = 2 + ( w w + w + w ) 3.7b and P 3 ( ) = 2 + ( m m + m + m m ) + m m. transcritical bifurcations occur when two equilibria collide non-destructively, exchanging their stability and resulting in the Jacobian matrix having a single eigenvalue equal to zero. by solving P2( = 0) = 0, we find R 0 w = 1, where R 0 w := m m ( 1 m ). the Jacobian has a double zero eigenvalue at this point, indicating the onset of a non-degenerate or degenerate bifurcation. the equilibria and their eigenvalues are real, ruling out the possibility of a branch of Hopf bifurcations emanating from the DBT point. t-free state v2 and coexistence state v3 are unstable, meaning the virus-free state is achieved. v1 becomes unstable, v3 becomes locally asymptotically stable, and v2 remains unstable. stability in the region R 0 m > 1 and R 0 w > 1 is governed by the transcritical bifurcation occurring along the curve R 0 m = R 0 w. the value of a basic reproduction number is proportional to the number of new infections arising in a following generation of virions from an infected cell. we can interpret the quantities R 0 m and R 0 w as basic reproduction numbers for the mutant and wt viral strains. to obtain conditions for Hopf bifurcations of v2, we search for a purely imaginary pair of eigenvalues. setting Q3( = i) = 0, we obtain the critical condition for a Hopf bifurcation, ad = bc. for all biologically meaningful solutions of ad = bc, the mutant strain of virus has the potential to gain periodic behaviour through the creation of a stable PO. a curve of global transcritical bifurcations of POs (TPO bifurcation) emanates from the DZH point rather than a curve of torus bifurcations [66]. the detailed stability and bifurcation analysis of v2, v3, as well as the DZH point, will be performed numerically. solid circles represent maxima and minima of stable POs. blue and orange lines denote equilibria that exist in biologically meaningful phase space. the parametric dependence of the population of healthy cells x is used. free state v1 and the wt-free state v2 undergo a transcritical bifurcation at m = 1.55. the two critical values of m divide the parameter space into three distinct regions. for 0.44 m 1.55, the wt-free state v2 is stable, corresponding to Region II. one-dimensional bifurcation diagrams shown in figure 3 can be rebuilt using the infection rate of the wt virus w as the bifurcation parameter for fixed values of m that lie on opposite sides of R 0 m = 1. but the resulting diagrams are qualitatively similar to those in figure 3, with the exception that the wt-free state v2 is switched with the coexistence state v3 and vice versa. the supercritical Hopf bifurcation now occurs from Figure 4a reveals a complicated bifurcation scenario that is largely centred on DBT and DZH bifurcations occurring at w = 1.04, m = 0.44 and w = 3.62, m = 1.55, respectively. the DBT bifurcation lies at the intersection of three curves of transcritical bifurcations satisfying R 0 w = 1, R 0 m = 1. cation curve associated with the wt-free state v2 does not depend on the infection rate of the wt virus w and thus appears as a straight line given by m = 1.55. one-dimensional bifurcation diagrams are obtained by setting w = 8 and treating m as a bifurcation parameter. the transcritical and Hopf bifurcations in figure 4a do not represent boundaries between the five characteristic regions and are not shown in figure 4b. for sufficiently small values of m, the system is in Region V, and there is a stable PO around the coexistence state v3. this PO is created by the Hopf bifurcation that defines the boundary between Regions III and V. supercritical Hopf bifurcations separate Regions IV from IV and III from V. the curve of transcritical bifurcations separates Regions II and III. despite the system exhibiting a range of complex dynamics, they can be elegantly classified and organized in terms of the regions shown in figure 4b. the infection rates are chosen to be from the different regions of the stability diagram shown in figure 4b. the other parameters are fixed to = 0.1, = 1, m = w = 0.5, m = w = 0.2222. from the definition of R 0 m given by (3.9), we see that the basic reproduction number of the mutant is independent of the virulence. w = ( w w w 1 + w ) 1 1. 3.15 The above equation is the condition for a transcritical bifurcation between the virus-free state v1 and the coexistence state v3. only for values of w > w crit will the virus persist in the system for this choice of infection rates. a transition between Regions II and III can occur via the transcritical bifurcation between the wt-free and coexistence states v2 and v3. the critical condition for this transcritical bifurcation is given by equation (3.10), and depends only on the virulence of the wt viral strain. this scenario corresponds to the so-called bubble bifurcation. virulence of the mutant strain, w, strongly controls the dynamics and the persistence of the wt strain. the survival of the wt strain, w, does not appear to depend on m. the effect of heterogeneity in mutation rates has been fixed to = 0.1. this is a key parameter that has been investigated within the framework of the error threshold [69,70] and lethal mutagenesis [71] in quasi-species theory. the stability diagram changes drastically, becoming that shown in figure 7b and contains only three regions: I, II and IV. as the mutation rate increases, the DBT bifurcation shifts to the right, eventually tending to infinity. we have used w = 3.0 and m = 1.0, along with the parameters in (3.12), in both panels. the equilibrium populations of infected cells and viral strains change with increasing mutation rate. this phenomenon is similar to the error threshold defined in quasi-species theory. the mutation rate of the wt virus is set to w = 0.1 and we consider two values of the mutation rate of the mutant virus. first, we take m = 103 w, so that the new form of mutation can be considered as a small perturbation to the original system of equations. the behaviour of the system can be described using three main states. co-dimension two bifurcation diagrams in terms of the wt and mutant virus infection rates w and m when backwards mutation is possible. the mutation rates are (a) m = 103 and w = 101 and (b) m = 101 and w = 101. all other parameters are given by (3.12) the second equilibrium v 1 := x = 1, y m = 0, y w = 0, z m = 0, z w = 0. 3.2 describes, whenever stable, a virus-free state whereby only the uninfected cells persist. there is no wt strain of the virus and the viral population is only composed of mutant genotypes. this equilibrium point involves, whenever stable, a state of coexistence for the wt and mutant strains. the coexistence state v3 can only be biologically meaningful if the burst size of wt strain satisfies > w(1 + /w) linear stability analysis is carried out to determine the behaviour of the system close to the equilibrium points. the Jacobian matrix for equations (2.4) is given by J =. straightforward calculations for the trivial solution v0 yield eigenvalues. the first factor, P1, provides a constant eigenvalue, = 1, which reserves the possibility for stability of v1. the next two factors P2 and P3 do not provide obvious eigenvalues, but they enable the identification of critical parameter groups for which v1 undergoes a bifurcation. v1 cannot undergo a Hopf bifurcation because the coefficients of the linear terms are strictly positive. transcritical bifurcations occur when two equilibria collide non-destructively, exchanging their stability and resulting in the Jacobian matrix having a single eigenvalue equal to zero. the Jacobian has a double zero eigenvalue at this point, indicating the onset of a non-degenerate or degenerate bifurcation. the equilibria and their eigenvalues are real, ruling out the possibility of a branch of Hopf bifurcations emanating from the DBT point. stability in the region R 0 m > 1 and R 0 w > 1 is governed by the transcritical bifurcation occurring along the curve R 0 m = R 0 w, which leads to an exchange of stability between wt-free and coexistence states, v2 and v3. the value of a basic reproduction number is proportional to the number of new infections arising in a following generation of virions from an infected cell. we can interpret the quantities R 0 m and R 0 w as basic reproduction numbers for the mutant and wt viral strains, respectively. to obtain conditions for Hopf bifurcations of v2, we search for a purely imaginary pair of eigenvalues. setting Q3( = i) = 0, we obtain the critical condition for a Hopf bifurcation, ad = bc, with = d / b being the angular frequency of the emerging POs. for all biologically meaningful solutions of ad = bc, the mutant strain of virus has the potential to gain periodic behaviour through a curve of global transcritical bifurcations of POs (TPO bifurcation) emanates from the DZH point rather than a curve of torus bifurcations. the detailed stability and bifurcation analysis of v2, v3, as well as the DZH point, will be performed numerically. w lie on opposite sides of curve of transcritical bifurcations involving v1 and v3. solid circles represent maxima and minima of stable POs. blue and orange lines denote equilibria that exist in biologically meaningful phase space. the two critical values of m divide the parameter space into three distinct regions. for 0.44 m 1.55, the wt-free state v2 is locally asymptotically stable, corresponding to Region II of figure 2. for m > 1.55, there is a new region, termed Region IV, where stable POs exist about the equilibrium v2. the supercritical hopf bifurcation now occurs from v3 and thus gives rise to Region V, characterized by the periodic coexistence of the viral populations. not all of the bifurcations shown in figure 4a lead to a biologically meaningful change in the dynamics, i.e. they do not represent a boundary between two distinct regions. Figure 4a reveals a complicated bifurcation scenario that is largely centred on DBT and DZH bifurcations occurring at w = 1.04, m = 0.44 and w = 3.62, m = 1.55, respectively. the bifurcation structure around the DBT point is identical to that predicted from the local stability analysis. one-dimensional bifurcation diagrams are obtained by setting w = 8 and treating m as a bifurcation parameter and then setting m = 2 and treating w as the bifurcation parameter. the resulting diagrams are shown in figure 5, with open circles denoting unstable POs. bifurcations in figure 4a do not represent boundaries between the five characteristic regions. the system is in Region V, and there is a stable PO around the coexistence state v3. as m is increased, the unstable POs around the wt-free state grow in size. this unstable PO collides and exchanges stability with the stable PO around v3. supercritical hopf bifurcations separate Regions IV from IV and III from V. the curve of transcritical bifurcations separates Regions II and III from V. despite the system exhibiting a range of complex dynamics, they can be elegantly classified and organized in terms of the regions shown in figure 4b. the infection rates are chosen to be from the different regions of the stability diagram shown in figure 4b. the other parameters are fixed to = 0.1, = 1, m = w = 0.5, m = w = 0.2222. from the definition of R 0 m given by (3.9), we see that the basic reproduction number of the mutant is independent of the virulence. critical value of the virulence of the wt virus is obtained w crit = ( w w 1 + w ) 1 1. 3.15 The above equation is the condition for a transcritical bifurcation between the virus-free state v1 and the coexistence state v3. only for values of w > w crit will the virus persist in the system for this choice of infection rates. the resulting stability diagram in terms of the virulence is shown in figure 6b. the choice of m = 1 along with the values of the parameters in (3.14) leads to R 0 m = 2.25. a transition between regions II and III can occur via the transcritical bifurcation between the wt-free and coexistence states v2 and v3. virulence of the mutant strain, w, strongly controls the dynamics and the persistence of the wt strain. the survival of the wt strain, w, does not appear to depend on m either. the effect of heterogeneity in mutation rates In the previous analyses, the mutation rate has been fixed to = 0.1. this is a key parameter that has been investigated within the framework of the error threshold [69,70] and lethal mutagenesis [71] in quasi-species theory. equation (3.18) defines a critical, finite mutation rate at which coexistence no longer becomes possible due to extinction of the wt virus due to the outcompetition by the mutant strains. the stability diagram changes drastically, becoming that shown in figure 7b. infected cells and viral strain populations change with increasing mutation rate. we have used w = 3.0 and m = 1.0, along with the parameters in (3.12), in both panels. this phenomenon is similar to the error threshold defined in quasi-species theory. the mutation rate of the wt virus is set to w = 0.1 and we consider two values of the mutation rate of the mutant virus. first, we take m = 103 w so that the new form of mutation can be considered as a small perturbation to the original system of equations (2.1) the two-dimensional bifurcation diagrams in figure 8a,b reveal that backwards mutation results in several important changes to the dynamics. the wt-free state can no longer occur due to the creation of the wt virus through backwards mutation. the mutation rates are (a) m = 103 and w = 101 and (b) m = 101 and w = 101. all other parameters are given by (3.12). the population of the mutant-type virus exists as long as the mutation rate of the wt strain is positive. the growth of the wt virus population jeopardizes its persistence in the system by creating its own competitor: the mutant-type virus. however, the larger the mutation rate, the greater the infection rate of the original wt strain should be. authors revised the manuscript and gave final approval for publication.
