{"summary": "human bocavirus (hBoV), human rhinovirus (hRV), polyomavirus-WU (WUPyV) and \u2013KI (KIPyV) and human coronaviruses (CoV)-OC43, -NL63, -HKU1 and -229E among children hospitalized with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) the newly tested viruses were detected at high frequency in association with other respiratory viruses, including previously-investigated viruses. the high frequency of viral co-infections illustrates the complexities in attributing causality to specific viruses in the aetiology of LRTI. human metapneumovirus (hMPV) [9], human bocavirus (hBoV) [10], human coronavirus NL63 (CoV-NL63) [11] and HKU1 (CoV-HKU1) [12] and WU and KI polyomaviruses (WUPyV, KIPyV) [13]\u2013[15]. human rhinovirus (hRV), previously associated with mild URTI, has increasingly been 9) efficacy trial and subsequent retrospective analysis of study participants were approved by the human research ethics committee. the main study did not have a clinical trials number since it was undertaken prior to registration of clinical trials having been made mandatory. the ethics committee did not require additional consent for this study. RNA was reverse transcribed with High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Life Technologies) and primed with oligo-dT primers. real-time PCR was done in an ABI 7500 RT-PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies) reactions were performed in 20 l using TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies) the previously developed respiratory index of severity in children (RISC) score was used to compare disease severity between single and multiple viral infections. chi-square or Fisher's exact tests were used to compare categorical variables and mean or median of continuous variables were compared by two-tailed Student t-test. hospital-based surveillance for all-cause hospitalization was undertaken at Chris Hani-Baragwanath Hospital, the only public hospital in the study community. hospital-based surveillance for all-cause hospitalization was undertaken according to the study protocol. LRTI was defined as any episode with clinical diagnosis of pneumonia or bronchiolitis done by a study physician. children were categorized as having clinical pneumonia if they had evidence of alveolar consolidation on chest x-ray (CXR-AC) or if they fulfilled the clinical diagnosis of LRTI without wheeze on chest auscultation but had rales and/or bronchial breathing. a p-value0.05 was considered significant. a total of 2147 hospitalizations for LRTI, including 2094 (97.5%) in which NPA had been collected. the same proportion of samples were available for RT\u2013PCR analysis. 0.762 Viral RT-PCR performed in this study 1460 (69.7) 699 (69.2) 761 (70.2) 0.621 517 (75.3) 232 (78.2) 285 (73.1) 0.130 943 (67.0) 467 (65.5) 476 (68.6) 0.218 1 : patients 2 years old, with diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infections, hospitalized between 1 February 2000 and 31 January 2002. children, 943 specimens were available for RT-PCR analysis, including 49.5% from PCV9-recipients and 50.5% from placebo-recipients. children were more likely to present as pneumonia (88.8% vs. 49.6%; p0.001).
