{"summary": "large-scale genome sequencing projects first advanced knowledge of the theoretical composition of proteomes. Using genome sequence data to guide the direct examination of proteomes then enabled the study of host-pathogen interactions occurring beyond the level of gene transcription. ideally suited to serve this purpose and have enormous potential applications in biomarker discovery, diagnosis, vaccine development, and drug discovery for infectious diseases. xMAP technology developed by Luminex Corporation (Austin, TX, USA) uses 5.6 micrometer polymer beads infused with two fluorescent dyes. binding measurements are performed by flow cytometry with two lasers. bead-based arrays are very useful for standardizing assays. antigen arrays find applications in serodiagnosis of disease, antibody-response profiling, and evaluation of immunity after vaccination. RPPMs were successfully used for the screening of cell-signaling pathways and posttranslational modifications of proteins [20\u201322] genomic DNA of the Copenhagen (NC_001559.1) vaccine strain (Dryvax) was used as the template for PCR amplification of the 273 open reading frames (ORF) all DNA clones were sequence-verified through the entire length of their inserts. fluorescent images were captured by scanning with a confocal laser. a high level of reproducibility with a very low background was apparent in repetitive assays. antibody interactions with all other proteins were insignificant, requiring no further treatment to suppress non-specific signals. a previous report analyzed the serological response to vaccinia and smallpox. a significant amount of the antibody response to vaccinia was not involved in the virus neutralization. a later report evaluated an attenuated smallpox modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) an alternative to Dryvax. antibodies from vaccination recognized a small number of proteins shared with pathogenic viral strains. the proteome of Y. pestis KIM encodes approximately 3885 proteins. the proteome of Y. pestis KIM contains 4202 individual proteins. new candidates for antibody biomarkers of bacterial infections and patterns of cross-reactivity with a panel of other gram-negative pathogens. a protein microarray consisting of 4% of Y. pestis proteins was used by Li et al. to profile antibody responses to live plague vaccine in rabbits [30], sentinel animals [31], and plague patients [32]. ella tularensis proteins derived from a larger chip were identified. a similar protein microarray approach was employed to find immunodominant antigens in mice vaccinated with killed F. tularensis vaccine and challenged with a virulent. a protein array produced from the outer membrane proteins of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was constructed [38] to study the immune response in patients. several antibody-binding antigens were identified by this group as potential diagnostic markers. the development of new proteomics methods has been driven in part by the need to identify new types of infection biomarkers. a protein microarray was probed with human fibronectin, fibrinogen, and C4 binding protein, all well-known targets of gram-positive bacteria. the high level of quality control required to sequence, purify, and characterize elements of a proteome microarray may not be as important for provisional screening purposes. antigens in the VZV proteome were identified from human sera. the protein array produced from an E. coli expression system was later used to detect antibodies in human sera reactive to VZV viral proteins. Luminex xMAP was used to study serological responses to 27 antigens of human papilloma virus. a protein array constructed from six coronaviruses was used for screening serum samples for virus-specific antibodies. the microarray data predicted SARS infection in 90% of patients correctly with a specificity of 93%. antibody microarrays Antibodies are a natural choice to be used as capture molecules due to their specificity, affinity, ease of production, and potential for engineering. antibody arrays are routinely used in the field of biomarker. antibody-based microarray was developed for the multiplexed detection of cholera, diphtheria, staphylococcal enterotoxin B, tetanus toxins, anthrax protective antigen, and lethal factor. the major drawback of capture microarrays is that few well-defined and high-quality antibodies against microorganisms are available. microarray printing Thin-layered nitrocellulose or chemically modified 2-D surfaces are generally used for immobilization of microarrayed proteins. glycerol, polyethylene glycol, or sugars that prevent drying of proteins should be carefully selected to match the type of surfaces used for arraying. gel-based 3-D surfaces made from polyacrylamide or agarose provide a hydrophilic environment. a new continuous flow microspotting method uses microfluidic channel networks to continuously circulate protein samples over a spot to achieve uniform and maximum protein adsorption. this technique may be especially useful for dilute and crude protein sample arraying. quantitative dot (QDs) nanoparticles are one alternative to fluorescent dyes. each contains an inorganic fluorescent core coated with a shell of another semiconductor such as CdS or ZnS. becton Dickinson markets a cytometric bead array (CBA) system. it includes flow cytometry for cytokine, chemokine, mouse isotyping. label-free detection methods are used for real-time monitoring of binding events. surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS) has been used as a low throughput method for on-chip purification of proteins, ionization, and detection. but this approach was not very successful in identifying biomarkers in parasitic diseases, and most markers found in the study were intact host proteins. invitrogen/Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA, USA) developed a data analysis package (ProtoArray Prospector) specifically designed for protein antigen microarrays, including a suite of statistical methods. bioArray software environment (BASE) addresses some of the issues we have outlined."}
