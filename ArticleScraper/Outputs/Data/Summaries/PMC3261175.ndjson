{"summary": "dendritic cell-specific intracellular adhesion molecular-3-grabbing nonintegrin (CLEC4L) and L-SIGN related (CLEC4M) are C-type lectins involved in both innate and adaptive immunity. CLEC4L (also called CD209) is expressed primarily on phagocytic cells, such as dendritic cells and macrophages. the neck-region is involved in assembling the lectin into a tetrameric protein conformation on the cell surface. the length variation of this neck-region had been proposed to affect the pathogen-binding properties of the CRD of these proteins. but this property is controversial [9]. the sequence identity of each repeat subunit of different VNTR alleles is determined by sequencing after cloning the PCR product. the haplotype of subunits of the same VNTR (from 4 to 9 repeats) sampled from different continents were virtually identical. this implied the different VNTR alleles in CLEC4M gene had existed for a long time, at least before the date of \u201cout-of-Africa\u201d event. different numbers of these subunits assemble to form the VNTR alleles of different length. the most prevalent subunit structures of each VNTR are described in Figure 2. the 7-repeat allele is formed by one H1, three H2, one H3, one H4 and one H5. the consensus configurations of other VNTR alleles are also shown in table 1. for 7-repeat allele, the remainder has one variant configuration which accounted for less than 4%. the difference between two subunits is due to a single base change which also represents a transition change. it signifies that the rearrangement cannot be caused by a single sporadic mutation. the 7-repeat was the dominant allele and was composed of five haplotype subunits in between the terminal subunits. the 6-repeat, 8-repeat and 9-repeat had the same haplotype subunit order as the 7-repeat. a dominant consensus configuration can be found in most VNTR alleles. genetic distance from non-African to East African declines monotonically with the geographical distance away from East Africa. the genetic distance between the other 25 non-African populations significantly correlated with their geographical distance to East Africa. the evolution of VNTR in CLEC4M gene was influenced mostly by genetic drift. the VNTR of CLEC4M gene plays an important role in innate immunity as pathogen receptor. the CLEC4M gene was studied as susceptibility gene to infectious and generated conflicting results [11]\u2013[13], [15], [16], [18], [19]. as the VNTR is the focus at issue, the study about it is urgent. in this study, we analyzed the sequence identity of each subunit among VNTR of 4 to 9 repeats alleles of 145 samples from different continental populations by clonal sequencing. only eight different haplotypes account for all sequence variations of all subunits. s has H1 and H4 followed by H5 (or their transition variants) in these two locations. 96.5% of alleles showed identical haplotype and arrangement of subunits. consensus configurations of other VNTR alleles are also shown in table 1. minor variant: difference between two subunits is due to a single base change which also represents a transition change. minor variant: the difference between two subunits is due to a single base change which also represents a transition change. a dominant consensus configuration can be found in most VNTR alleles. it is found that only less than 2.5% of alleles have major rearrangement. a dominant consensus configuration can be found in most VNTR alleles. we divided the individuals of the human Genome Diversity Panel into 26 populations according to Barreiro et al.[20]. we used the VNTR locus as a marker to calculate genetic distances between populations. the genetic distance between the other 25 non-African populations significantly correlated with their geographical distance to East Africa. the VNTR of CLEC4M gene plays an important role in innate immunity as pathogen receptor. it was studied as susceptibility gene to infectious and generated conflicting results [11]\u2013[13], [15], [16], [18], [19]. as the VNTR is the focus at issue, the study about it is urgent. no evidence was found to support the notion of multiple independent mutation events at this VNTR due to natural selection. a sample of 145 individuals composed of 21 Africans, 20 Middle Easterns, 35 Europeans, 38 Asians, 13 Oceania, and 18 Americans were chosen from the HGDP-CEPH panel. recruitment of all the individuals met the criteria set by the HGDP ethics committee. PCR was performed in a 50 l volume with 50 ng genomic DNA as template, 5 l PCR 10 buffer, 4 l dNTP mix (2.5 mM), 2 l primers (10 pM), 1.25 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (Takara) thermal cycler was performed at 95\u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 20 s, 59\u00b0C for 30 s, 72\u00b0C for 60 s and extension at the clonal sequence of the 290 chromosomes of the worldwide population sample then called according to the subunit haplotype (H1 to H8). the common 7-repeat VNTR allele is formed by one H1, three H2, one each of H3, H4, and H5 in order of H1-H2-H2-H2-H3-H4-H5. this sample set covered all types of repeats (4- to 9-repeat) in VNTR locus in each continent based on the data of the CLEC4M neck-region variation in the HGDP-CEPH panel. the genotype was determined by separating the PCR products in 3% agarose gel with ethidium bromide staining. the purified PCR products were cloned into PMD 18-T Vector (Takara, Japan) and transferred into an ultracompetent cell (Takara, Japan) at least 5 clones were chosen at random and sequenced in order to reduce artifactual error leading to single nucleotide variants and artificial recombination due to PCR. locus in CLEC4M gene were used to calculate the genetic distance between populations. first, the samples of the human genome diversity panel were divided into 26 populations. the population from northeastern Bantu of Kenya was defined as the human origin region population."}
