{"summary": "bovine coronavirus (BCoV), bovine respiratory syncytial virus, bovine parainfluenza virus 3 and bovine herpesvirus type 1 (1, 2). a nearly full-length genome of a bovine rhinitis B virus (BRBV) was identified. between six and nine million reads were obtained per sample. the BRBV identified in this study (BRBV_SWE1) clustered together with a BRBV strain (Mexb10) collected from beef cattle in Mexico in 2015 (6). the nucleotide similarity between the two sequences varied between 71 and 75%."}
