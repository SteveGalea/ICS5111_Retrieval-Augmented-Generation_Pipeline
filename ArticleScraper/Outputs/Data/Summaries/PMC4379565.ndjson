{"summary": "hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is an important global public health problem. the prevalence of hepatitis C varies significantly worldwide, imposing an important burden in highly endemic countries. hepatitis C is commonly associated with chronic liver disease. the high mutation rate is characteristic of HCV replication, resulting in a high degree of intrahost genetic diversity. this remarkable genetic variability is one of the main factors that have prevented the development of a successful vaccine. Molecular surveillance of hepatitis C is of the utmost importance for identification of HCV transmission networks. hepatitis a (HAV) [24] and hepatitis B viruses (HBV) [25] were discovered in the late 1960s and early 1970s. this event was followed by the discovery of the hepatitis A (HAV) [24] and hepatitis B viruses (HBV) [25] in the late 1960s and early 1970s. this event was followed by the discovery of the hepatitis virus in the late 1980s. the most relevant discoveries related to the study of HCV are shown in chronological order. an important advance for drug development was the generation of human hepatoma cell lines capable of replicating HCV. in 2009, ge et al. reported a strong association between polymorphisms in the promoter region of the interleukin-28B gene (also known as IFN-3) and the antiviral response based on IFN [75]. work conducted by other groups further confirmed the relationship between the IL-28B genotype and sustained viral response (SVR) [76,77] the time of initial spread of HCV into western countries can only be indirectly inferred. the restriction of HCV transmission through primarily parenteral routes implicates unsafe injections as the main vehicle for HCV transmission. cultural traditions, such as tattooing and scarification, were likely to have played an important role in the spread of HCV. the size of circles represents fluctuations in the size of viral populations over time. Upon transmission, HCV undergoes a series of events that affect the architecture of the viral population. genetic bottlenecks are so intense following transmission that very few variants are able to establish infection in the new host. this staging is likely to affect HCV transmission because different viral variants that most likely possess different degrees of transmissibility are available at different time points during the course of the infection. genetic relatedness can be successfully established in many instances if transmission has occurred relatively recently. the limitations of HCV molecular studies are depicted when not all individuals belonging to the transmission network are included. artificially linked cases can be observed when not all members of the transmission network are sampled. several single nucleotide polymorphisms in immune-related genes have been associated with HCV disease outcomes. several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in immune-related genes have been associated with HCV disease outcomes. IFN- is a multifunctional cytokine produced by effector T and NK cells. it inhibits HCV replication in vitro, and intrahepatic levels are associated with viral clearance in animal models. IL-10 inhibits IFN- production, resulting in an imbalance in the T helper response. patients exhibiting an AA genotype showed poor SVR rates and progressed to more severe disease. a SNP in the mannan-binding lectin gene (MBL) has been related to HCV infection. IFN-s inhibit viral replication and modulates immune-related functions, such as the maturation and differentiation of immune cells [164,165,166]. the SNPs in IL-28B have been recognized as strong predictors for both spontaneous and antiviral-induced clearance of HCV. new technologies based on NGS platforms allow a finer resolution and are more affordable. the analysis of the composition of HCV intrahost populations requires nucleotide sequencing of as many variants as possible in the patient. complexity, cost and reliability are some of the factors that play a role in the choice of methods. the 5'-UTR region has been widely used for detection. the NS5B region is the most common target for HCV genotyping. rapid divergence in this region represents a challenge for molecular epidemiological studies. sensitivity is another major limitation of SSCP. only variants present in >3% of the viral population can successfully be identified. sensitivity is another major limitation of SSCP. amplification of the region of interest followed by cloning of the amplicons into a plasmid vector and transformation of bacteria. the bacteria are assumed to carry only one plasmid, and the presence of only one viral variant sequence is confirmed by colony PCR and sequencing. the exact number of clones necessary to achieve a given level of confidence depends on the frequency of each incorrect nucleotide at any given nucleotide position in the sequence. EPLD-PCR relies on the isolation of individual coexisting sequence variants in clinical samples using a limiting-dilution approach followed by sequencing. real-time-based EPLD-PCR is superior to conventional population sequencing methods for the detection of HCV viral variants. however, implementation of EPLD-PCR is cumbersome and time consuming. the identification of nucleotide polymorphisms comprising >10% of the amplicon population depends on the proper representation of such variants in the reference database required for base calling [196] the advent of (NGS) has revolutionized the diagnostics of infectious diseases [197] the low abundance of nucleic acids is a major problem for the molecular characterization of viruses from clinical samples. the low ratio of viral RNA/host RNA commonly observed in clinical samples is one of the main obstacles to using NGS methods. study of viral genetics in the era of next generation sequencing promises to help to unveil the most intimate details of the virus-host interface. the 5'-UTR region has been widely used for detection owing to its degree of conservation across genotypes. NS5B region is the most common target for HCV genotyping. sensitivity is another major limitation of SSCP, because only variants present in >3% of the viral population can successfully be identified. other factors affecting the performance of SSCP include DNA concentration and GC content. the bacteria are assumed to carry only one plasmid, and the presence of only one viral variant sequence is confirmed by colony PCR and sequencing. the exact number of clones necessary to achieve a given level of confidence depends on the frequency of each incorrect nucleotide at any given nucleotide position in the sequence. sequencing 99 clones has been proposed to identify 95% of all variants present at a frequency of at least 3% in the population. however, others have suggested that sequencing 20 clones is sufficient to cover 95% of the major variants. EPLD-PCR relies on the isolation of individual coexisting sequence variants in clinical samples using a limiting-dilution approach followed by sequencing. real-time-based EPLD-PCR is superior to conventional population sequencing methods for the detection of HCV viral variants. however, implementation of EPLD-PCR is tedious and time consuming, resulting in a rather expensive methodology. the advent of (NGS) has revolutionized the diagnostics of infectious diseases. new approaches have overcome the issue associated with short reads. newer approaches have overcome the issue associated with short reads. low ratio of viral RNA/host RNA commonly observed in clinical samples is one of the main obstacles to using NGS methods. viral enrichment and concentration have been used as alternative methods to improve sequencing quality and depth. increasing the depth of sequencing for an optimized sample preparation can decrease the level of detection. increasing number of viral sequences available in public and private databases has promoted the development of novel ways to analyze considerably large data sets. virology has recently drawn the interest of the bioinformatics community, which in turn led to the development of a variety of tools. despite the growth in viral bioinformatics, a number of questions remain unanswered. phylogenetic trees derived from HCV sequence analyses cannot faithfully represent complex evolutionary relationships relevant to HCV. significant differences in evolution rates (high over the short term and much lower over the long term), gene transfer, evolutionary virus-host relationship, and lack of physical \u201cfossil records\u201d of viruses remain difficult obstacles to overcome. initiatives such as the Viral Bioinformatics Resource Center (VBRC) aim to close the gaps between massive viral sequencing and bioinformatics are a welcome addition to the set of on-line bioinformatics tools available to the scientific community. these tools provide comprehensive web-based genomics resources that are useful for basic and applied virology research. tools designed for the dynamic alignment of viral sequences in the HIV database were easily adapted for the HCV database. the information is accessed via an interface allowing for advanced searches with sorting and graphical overview capabilities. the viPR resource provides the scientific community with friendly tools capable of performing complex analytical workflows. the requirement for the establishment of a database-type of molecular surveillance network that is feasible for international surveillance networks is the standardization of the input data. the introduction of NGS in routine diagnostics is likely to further boost HCV integrative surveillance. comprehensive analyses including human genetics, phylogenetics and data mining could be easily attained locally by researchers in the field. the main components required for advanced molecular surveillance of HCV are listed. global databases containing comprehensive information about transmission events are used as a source of information to draw conclusions about viral spread. bioinformatics a variety of computational challenges are commonly encountered in the field of virology owing to the high diversity of viruses, their compact genome organization and their rapid rate of evolution. virology has recently drawn the interest of the bioinformatics community, which in turn led to the development of a variety of tools. the ultimate goal in HCV genetics is the prediction of the course of HCV evolution that in turn could lead to the customized management of the patient and hepatitis C treatment. phylogenetics are an important area in virology, particularly in HCV molecular epidemiology. database is a collection of data that is organized so that its contents can easily be accessed, managed, and updated. many databases for infectious diseases compile data obtained from clinical and/or public health laboratories, aiding the monitoring of infectious disease trends and surveillance. VBRC consists of relational databases and web applications for data storage, annotation, analysis, and information exchange. the HCV database contains HCV-associated genetic data and provides access to the central database via web-accessible search interfaces. the information is accessed via an interface allowing for advanced searches with sorting and graphical overview capabilities. cross-referencing data and integrated computational tools into the online ViPR resource allow complex analyses. ViPR captures data from external and internal sources and makes them accessible through custom searches. an HCV integrative molecular surveillance tool should ideally be web-based. the ideal HCV integrative database should be enriched with data from ongoing molecular surveillance projects and outbreak investigations. comprehensive analyses including human genetics, phylogenetics and data mining could be easily attained locally by researchers in the field. decision-tree analysis relies on a tree-shaped structure representing decision \u201ccalls\u201d with classifying power. each internal node denotes an attribute, each branch represents an outcome of the test, and each terminal node a class. other approaches, such as linear progression and Bayesian network analyses, have also been shown to produce robust predictions for the progression to fibrosis. a journey and the future of HCV control looks more promising than ever before."}
