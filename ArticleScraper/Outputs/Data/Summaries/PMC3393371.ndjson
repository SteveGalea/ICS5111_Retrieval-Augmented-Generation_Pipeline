{"summary": "the coronavirus hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHE-CoV) infects mainly piglets under the age of 3 weeks and causes vomiting, exhaustion, and obvious neurological symptoms. the mortality rate ranges from 20 to 100% (11) in 1962, the pathogen was isolated from suckling pigs suffering from encephalomyelitis in Canada. the natural host of PHE-CoV is the pig, but the virus has been adapted experimentally for replication in mice and Wistar rats. the virus is neurotropic in mice, but susceptibility was found to be influenced by age and the route of inoculation. pig industry cannot ignore the potential hazards of PHE. development of a PHE-CoV vaccine to control PHE-CoV infection will be economically and medically significant. the viruses were propagated by passage in porcine kidney epithelial cells (PK-15 cells) (9), purified by sucrose density gradient centrifugation, and stored at 80\u00b0C until use. the inactivated virus was then diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and was mixed with Alhydrogel diluted 9:1 according to the reference protocol in \u201cthe Veterinary Biological Products Quality Standard in China\u201d. RT-PCR was performed in a total reaction volume of 25 l using the One-Step RT-PCR kit (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) PCR was performed with an initial denaturation at 96\u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 50 s, 50\u00b0C for 50 s, and 72\u00b0C for 2 min. the gene fragment was recovered from pTS1 by double-enzyme cleavage using EcoRI/ the gene was amplified from PHE-CoV genomic RNA and was subcloned into pVAX1 to construct recombinant plasmid pVAX1-S1. group 1 consisted of mice (10 per vaccine group) that were immunized at 0, 2, and 4 weeks, sacrificed at 6 weeks. the virus neutralization (VN) assay is a more reliable measure than the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test for the detection of PHE-CoV infection. the serum for the VN assay was inactivated at 56\u00b0C for 30 min and was diluted with minimum essential medium (MEM) anti-mouse IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG3 and IgA antibodies were added to the wells, and the plates were incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. after four washes with PBST, the plates were incubated with a peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:4,000; Sigma) 100 l of RPMI 1640 was used as a control. plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C under 5% CO2 for 48 h. 10 l of 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide was added to each well. ens were collected; single-cell suspensions stimulated with inactivated PHE-CoV were prepared. levels of cytokines interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-) and gamma interferon (IFN-) were detected by using an ELISA kit. the viruses were propagated by passage in porcine kidney epithelial cells (PK-15 cells) (9), purified by sucrose density gradient centrifugation, and stored at 80\u00b0C until use. the inactivated virus was then diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and was mixed with Alhydrogel diluted 9:1 according to the reference protocol in \u201cthe Veterinary Biological Products Quality Standard in China\u201d.

DISCUSSION Pigs are the only species known to be naturally susceptible to PHE-CoV infection. most of the infections in this species are subclinical, and the overall economic impact of the disease is low. the development of safe, high-performance vaccines for the prevention and treatment of PHE-CoV has important practical significance. the immunization protocols were used to evaluate the ability of the vaccines to induce serum neutralizing antibodies and cellular immune responses. the addition of alum to the IPV preparation was found to increase the serum VN activity significantly. the addition of alum to inactivated PHE-CoV increased the time over which the immune animals could effectively stimulate a humoral immune response. previous studies have shown that the protective effect of DNA vaccines is not dependent on higher doses but that immune boosters designed to improve the antigen expression level could induce a high level of antibody response. combined immunization groups are generally divided into cytotoxic T (Tc) cells, suppressor T (Ts) cells, delayed-type hypersensitivity T (TD) cells, and helper/inducer T (Th) cells. the distribution of CD4+ on the Th cell surface can increase the number of memory cells. cytokines divide the T cells into Th1 and Th2 cell subsets. the main role of these cytokines is to promote antibody production. the IPV group induced mainly IL-4 and did so at a higher level than the IP group. al and cellular immune responses are known to contribute to protection against coronavirus infection (26), though T cells may also play a role in exacerbating the pathology of some animal coronavirus infections (35). mice that were vaccinated twice with DNA vaccines and were then boosted with IPV could activate both B and T cells to induce specific humoral and cellular immune responses."}
