{"summary": "a number of viruses in plants, animals, fungi and bacteria have been described as pathogens. many are commensals and some are mutualists. the most extreme cases of virus mutualism are really symbiogenic relationships. the most well studied mutualistic viruses are the polydnaviruses. most of the viral genes reside in the nuclear genome of the wasp. the virions package wasp genes suppress the immune response of the caterpillar. ichnovirus relationship to an as yet unclassified insect virus was also suggested. polydnaviruses are obligate symbionts of their braconid (bracoviruses) or ichneumonid (ichnoviruses) parasitoid wasp hosts. most of the viral genes reside in the nuclear genome of the wasp. most of the viral genes reside in the nuclear genome of the wasp. the best example of endogenous retroviruses leading to speciation is in the evolution of placental mammals [15\u201317] there are also speculations that endogenous (and exogenous) retroviruses played a role in the evolution of adaptive immunity [18] for the endogenous viruses, there is very limited population variation for the virus outside of the dynamics of the host. population dynamics could be driven by either of these forces, or a third, its double-stranded (ds) RNA genome. there have been few reported studies on the population dynamics of these viruses. for ssRNA viruses these populations are often called quasispecies. fidelity of dsRNA virus polymerases has only been measured for the bacteriophage 6 and it is in the range of one in 106 [30] studies with this virus suggest replication occurs in a stamping machine method, such that all the progeny in a burst are derived directly from the infecting virus genome. ian immunodeficiency virus, endemic in chimpanzees and only rarely pathogenic [34], and more recently Severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS) that apparently emerged from wild civet cats [35,36]. in wild animals these viruses would be called persistent viruses. there is a general conception that quasispecies are large in recently emerged viruses like HIV that are still adapting to their hosts. virulence is associated with high levels of variation. a commensal or mutualistic virus may be more likely to maintain its lifestyle if its variation level is kept low. this implies something beyond random error-prone virus replication controlling the degree of variation in a quasispecies. human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) apparently emerged numerous times from the closely related Simian immunodeficiency virus, endemic in chimpanzees [33] and only rarely pathogenic [34], and more recently Severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS) that apparently emerged from wild civet cats [35,36] there are no studies that directly compare within-host populations of viruses that are both pathogens and mutualists under different circumstances. virulence is associated with high levels of variation in a quasispecies. a commensal or mutualistic virus may be more likely to maintain its lifestyle if its variation level is kept low. at least one persistent plant virus encodes a gene for its legume plant host that can affect nodulation. the exception is the conditional mutualism of ssRNA acute plant viruses in plants found under extreme conditions of drought or cold. for animals, most of the mutualistic viruses are dsDNA viruses that tend to have much lower population variation, although persistent viruses in animals can have any genome type."}
