{"summary": "HEV genotypes HEV-3 and HEV-4 are the cause of sporadic cases of hepatitis E in developed countries. consumption of processed pork products in the united kingdom has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of acquiring HEV. a direct immune-regulation in infected pigs could not be confirmed for genotype 1 PRRSV [12]. less pathogenic strains of genotype 1 PRRSV seem to cause a more persistent infection than highly pathogenic ones which are better resolved by the immune response. pigs were from farms in England (81.7%), followed by northern Ireland (13.4%), Scotland (4.5%), and Wales (0.3%). antibody to PRRSV had been detected in 362 of 621 plasma samples. only 610 of these plasma samples were also analyzed for the presence of antibodies to HEV. PCR amplicons were purified using the Beckman AMPure solid phase reversible immobilisation (SPRI) technique. cycle sequencing was performed using forward and reverse primers and ABI BigDye chemistry. samples were sequenced on an ABI capillary electrophoresis DNA analyser (Applied Biosystems Ltd., Warrington, UK) collated data for PRRSV active infection (RNA in tonsil) and seropositivity and active infection for HEV were available for 358 pigs. all PCR-positive samples were of genotype 1 (European), which is endemic in the UK, and no genotype 2 virus was detected. two PCR-positive tonsils were not suitable for sequencing as there was insufficient viral nucleic acid in the samples. six samples did not yield useable sequence data. only three of the sequences may be considered to originate from the currently licensed attenuated vaccine. the 23 ORF5 sequences obtained from the PCR-positive samples are shown in the context of 431 other UK ORF5 sequences dating from 1991 to 2014. the black triangles indicate samples that were also positive for hepatitis E virus by PCR. pathogen RNA Status HEV Seropositive n (%) RNA + Plasma and/or Cecum n (%) RNA + Plasma n (%) PRRSV PCR negative (n = 327) 311 (95.1) 55 (16.8) 12 (3.7) 48 (14.7) PCR positive (n = 31) 26 (83.9) 6 (19.4) 2 (6.5) 5 (16.1) p = 0.01 p = 0.73 p = 0.45 p = 0.83. almost two-thirds of the PCR-positive pigs were from farms in east Anglia or east Riding and north Lincolnshire. prevalence of PRRSV RNA-positive tonsils was similar across the age groups. only three of the sequences may be considered to originate from the currently licensed attenuated vaccine. all of the 23 sequences are found in clades where other UK strains were already identified. no distinct clustering is observed in the clade in which the PRRSV strains belong. pathogen RNA Status HEV Seropositive n (%) RNA + Plasma and/or Cecum n (%) RNA + Plasma n (%) PRRSV seropositive animals were less likely to be HEV PCR positive in plasma or cecum. PRRSV seropositive animals were less likely to be HEV PCR positive in plasma or cecum. PRRSV PCR positive animals were less likely (83.9% vs. 7.8%, p = 0.05) to be HEV seropositive in plasma (Table 3). discussion It has been suggested that infection with PRRSV renders pigs more susceptible to secondary bacterial [7,8,10,22] or viral [9,23] infections. a proportion of healthy pigs from PRRSV-infected units may be infectious at slaughter. if still shedding virus, may be able to transmit the virus to other farms. these findings triggered the genetic characterization of the viruses in order to further evaluate the potential risks associated with their presence. the sequences from the abattoir samples did not cluster separately from those from clinical cases submitted for diagnostic testing. we found no evidence that exposure to, or infection with PRRSV enhanced HEV infection rates in pigs entering the food chain. however, pigs exposed to PRRSV were less likely to be viremic (p = 0.05) the simultaneous co-infection resulted in delays to both the latent period (13.4 vs. 7.1 days with HEV alone) and the humoral response (43.1 vs. 26.3 days) to HEV, as well as increasing the infectious period (48.6 vs. 9.7 days), in association with an increased HEV viral load. some studies have failed to show any association between PRRSV and other viral infections. no association was found between PRRSV and HEV infections in slaughter-age pigs. there was no difference in strain diversity of PRRSV sampled from clinically unaffected pigs in this study."}
