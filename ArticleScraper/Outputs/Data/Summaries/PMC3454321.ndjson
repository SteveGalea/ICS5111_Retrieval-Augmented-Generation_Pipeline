{"summary": "the etiological agent of SARS disease was determined to be of the coronavirus (CoV) family; the largest family of single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genomes known. the overall mortality rate of SARS corona virus (SARS-CoV) infection was 10% but this rate was 50% in patients over 65. the promiscuity of coronaviruses coupled with the tendency for mutations to occur gives reason for concern that another CoV outbreak is likely. the mechanisms by which the virus evades host immune responses causing generalized inflammation, increasing viral burden, and severe lung pathology still remain a significant scientific problem. ferrets are susceptible to wild-type SARS-CoV infection from strains isolated from humans. ferrets display many of the symptoms and pathological features as seen in infected humans. ferrets were immunized with a SARS-CoV vaccine and then challenged to compare immunological profiles with the reinfected animals. ferret, Mustela putorius furo, displays many of the symptoms and pathological features seen in SARS-CoV infected humans. sneezing was not observed in ferrets from the control group (A), nor in group (C) at any time post-infection. neutralizing antibody titers rose above baseline from 6 DPI to maximum post-infection levels at 15 DPI. the TOR2 strain of SARS-CoV replicated well in the upper respiratory tract and lung within the first week post-infection. a second spike in neutralizing antibodies (1300U) above levels was observed within a week. this second peak in neutralizing antibodies was coincident with restricted viral replication. inverse neutralization titre is represented on y-axis vs. day of study on the x-axis. ferrets were infected on study day 1 and reinfected ferrets were also innoculated on study day 30. ferrets that received infection-reinfection were protected from lung histopathology (C) three ferrets at each time point were profiled and gene expression signatures associated with pulmonary immunopathology during SARS were identified. a heat map overview containing 3454 genes identified as significantly differentially expressed across all time points. EDGE analysis across all time points identified 3454 genes as significantly differently expressed (2-fold change in at least one time point, p0.05, and q0.1) genes were then one-way hierarchically clustered by gene using Pearson correlation and average distance metrics. gene expression patterns showed strong activation of inflammation-related genes, activation of MAPK, JAK-STAT and Wnt signaling pathways. among the upregulated genes on 2DPR, lysosomal degradation was the only among the KEGG pathways to be significantly enriched. results suggest that there are differential gene expression profiles corresponding to SARS infection compared to reinfection. protein catabolic process 64 6 16 G-protein coupled receptor protein signalling pathway 63 4 17 Protein kinase cascade 53 5 11 Inflammatory response 45 6 10 KEGG Pathways MAPK signaling pathway 44 5 7 Wnt signaling pathway 26 4 3 Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction 24 0 4 Jak-STAT signaling pathway 19 3 4 Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) ation was correlated to the transition from innate to specific immune responses and clearance of SARS-CoV during primary infection. expression of selected significantly changed genes over time in infected\u2013reinfected ferret lungs. s complement component 1, s subcomponent Cfa.10821 1.72 1.93 1.53 1.48 0.37 0.49 0.75 0.59 0.91 0.05 0.42 0.18 0.001 C3 complement component 3 Cfa.12240 2.26 1.63 0.14 0.13 0.05 0.32 0.01 1.72 0.52 0.56 0.32 0.015 C3 complement component 3 CfaAffx.27491 1.03 0.98 0.57 0.10 0.57 0.92 0.64 0.73 0.68 IL-6 Signaling GRB2 growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 Cfa.16367 1.58 1.50 0.83 0.29 0.67 0.49 0.69 0.60 0.52 0.50 0.22 0.52 0.034 IL6 interleukin 6 Cfa.3528 0.17 0.35 1.44 1.71 0.28 0.16 0.17 0.19 0.61 0.28 0.19 0.12 0.001 JUN jun oncogene CfaAffx.28854 1.68 1.33 AKR1B1 aldo-keto reductase family 1, member B1 Cfa.7651 1.23 1.44 0.89 0.48 0.84 0.62 0.66 0.82 0.77 0.33 0.33 0.38 0.039 ATP1B3 ATPase, Na+/K+ transporting, beta 3 Cfa.9984 1.44 1.98 1.60 1.04 0.88 0.37 0.53 0.68 0.26 0.72 0.005 CASP4 caspase 4 Cf CSNK1D casein kinase 1, delta Cfa.19594 1.11 1.44 1.44 1.13 0.84 0.56 0.04 0.26 0.16 0.22 0.36 0.72 0.12 0.001 CXCL10 chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 10 Cfa.16590 0.60 0.39 0.01 1.11 0.11 0.05 0.10 0.01 0.12 0.07 0.00 0.09 0.044 EIF3A eukaryotic translation 0.031 guanine nucleotide binding protein, beta 1 Cfa.3773 1.20 1.32 0.54 0.08 0.55 0.42 0.34 0.20 0.41 0.40 0.33 0.26 0.029 GPX1 glutathione peroxidase 1 Cfa.4561 0.96 1.07 1.08 0.57 0.65 0.24 0.23 0.28 0.44 0.03 0.18 0.004 HIF1A hypoxia-inducible factor 1, alpha subunit Cf IFI6 interferon, alpha-inducible protein 6 Cfa.20456 1.32 1.04 1.08 0.60 0.11 0.55 0.12 0.31 0.27 0.74 0.82 0.75 0.001 IRF1 interferon regulatory factor 1 Cfa.18304 1.59 1.56 0.83 0.03 0.60 0.50 0.30 0.23 0.47 0.40 0.60 0.45 0.007 IRF2 interferon regulatory factor 2 Cfa.19144 0.73 0.91 1.11 0.29 0.001 PLSCR1 phospholipid scramblase 1 CfaAffx.13019 0.65 0.52 1.02 0.71 0.28 0.34 0.21 0.32 0.24 0.28 0.30 0.36 0.002 PMPCB peptidase (mitochondrial processing) beta Cfa.290 1.78 1.93 1.62 0.92 0.82 0.68 0.62 0.68 0.73 0.63 0.61 0.62 0.015 PSMB8 proteasome (prosome,mac fa.10605 1.48 1.69 1.59 0.99 0.89 0.85 0.69 0.94 0.95 0.60 0.79 0.043 SLBP stem-loop binding protein Cfa.12597 1.14 1.30 1.12 0.93 0.58 0.47 0.72 0.51 0.34 0.33 0.34 0.22 0.020 STAT1 signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 Cfa.20754 1.38 1.21 1.78 1.32 0.15 0.01 0.63 0.16 0.12 0.08 0. the expression of IL-6 and seven IL-6 signaling-associated genes was increased in ferret lungs as early as 2 DPI and until 7 DPI. IL-6 and STAT3 gene expression was confirmed by QRT-PCR. hyper innate IFN and IFN response gene (IRG) activity could be identified in acutely-infected SARS-CoV patients. fifty IRGs were significantly upregulated in ferret lung tissue during the first 2\u20137 DPI with SARS-CoV relative to mock-infected ferrets. time points performed using only the 28 DPI through 28 DPR identified only 29 significantly increased genes relative to 28 DPI. the integrated expression of innate immune genes, IRGs, and IFN-mediated chemokines in the lungs of viremic SARS-CoV infected ferrets reflected the antiviral responses that correlate with only the acute phase of SARS. ferret also shows promise in the evaluation of candidate SARS vaccines. 8 of the 42 IRGs were downregulated at least two-fold at 2 or 7 DPC in ferrets previously immunized with SARS FCP-A relative to the mock-vaccinated group. these 8 IRGs included: ISG15 (QRT-PCR shown in Figure S1), GPX1 (an antioxidant enzyme), and PSME1 and 2 (roles in MHC class I antigen processing) ferrets were assigned to three treatment groups for this study. the infected groups were innoculated intranasally (IN) with 103 TCID50 (50% tissue culture infective dose) of SARS-CoV TOR2 strain. sneezing was not observed in ferrets from the control group (A), nor in group (C) at any time post-infection. the boost in antibody titer may have contributed to the lower viral burden observed during the reinfection phase. this second peak in neutralizing antibody titres was coincident with restricted viral replication. the TOR2 strain of SARS-CoV replicated well in the upper respiratory tract and lung within the first week post-infection. ferrets were infected on study day 1 and reinfected ferrets were also innoculated on study day 30. values shown represent group means of 3\u20134 ferrets per group. three ferrets at each time point were profiled and gene expression signatures associated with pulmonary immunopathology during SARS were identified. a heat map overview containing 3454 genes identified as significantly differentially expressed across all time points and classified by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis into three clusters of functionally related genes. EDGE analysis across all time points identified 3454 genes as significantly differently expressed. genes were then one-way hierarchically clustered by gene using Pearson correlation and average distance metrics. the most significant canonical signaling pathways according to IPA for the resulting clusters are noted. lysosomal degradation was the only among the KEGG pathways to be significantly enriched. this scenario is suggestive of the presence of relevant phagocytosis-mediated immunity but without triggering a significant inflammatory response. a cluster enriched in complement system genes, including C1NH, C1QA/B/C, C1R/S, C3, C4A, C8B, CFB, CR1, FCN1 and MASP1 was significantly upregulated during the first 2 weeks post-reinfection. complement activation was correlated to the transition from innate to specific immune responses and clearance of SARS-CoV during primary infection. gene Expressiona Gene Name Ferret-likeGene IDc Days Post Infection Days Post Reinfection EDGE p valueb 2 3 5 7 14 28 2 3 5 7 14 28 Complement System C1NH C1 inhibitor Cfa.3117 1.31 1.74 0.97 1.41 0.25 0.11 0.03 0.03 0.02 0.39 0.54 0.42 0.51 0.001 C1QA complement component 1, q subcomponent, A chain Cfa.1379 1.57 1.58 1.58 1.58 complement component 3 Cfa.12240 2.26 1.63 0.14 0.00 1.13 0.05 0.32 0.01 1.72 0.52 0.56 0.32 0.015 C3 complement component 3 CfaAffx.27491 1.03 0.98 0.57 0.10 0.57 0.92 0.64 0.73 0.68 0.54 0.58 0.32 0.044 C4A complement component 8. 0.83 0.29 0.67 0.49 0.69 0.60 0.52 0.50 0.22 0.52 0.034 IL6 interleukin 6 Cfa.3528 0.17 0.35 1.44 1.71 0.28 0.16 0.17 0.19 0.61 0.28 0.19 0.12 0.001 JUN jun oncogene CfaAffx.28854 1.68 1.33 1.20 0.35 0.19 0.37 0.30 0.18 0.07 0.07 0.07 0.05 0.41 0.001 0.89 0.48 0.84 0.62 0.66 0.82 0.77 0.33 0.33 0.38 0.039 ATP1B3 ATPase, Na+/K+ transporting, beta 3 Cfa.9984 1.44 1.98 1.60 1.04 0.88 0.37 0.53 0.68 0.26 0.55 0.24 0.72 0.005 CASP4 caspase 4 Cfa.3589 0.91 0.82 1.86 1.36 0.54 0.00 0.35 0.29 0.12 0.28 0.19 0.40 ligand 10 Cfa.16590 0.60 0.39 0.01 1.11 0.11 0.05 0.10 0.01 0.12 0.07 0.00 0.09 0.044 EIF3A eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3, subunit A Cfa.16750 1.33 1.43 1.01 0.37 0.87 0.60 0.41 0.49 0.48 0.43 0.25 0.46 0.016 EPRS glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetase Cfa.222 0.63 GPX1 glutathione peroxidase 1 Cfa.4561 0.96 1.07 1.08 0.57 0.65 0.24 0.23 0.28 0.44 0.03 0.18 0.004 HIF1A hypoxia-inducible factor 1, alpha subunit CfaAffx.24079 1.66 1.72 1.65 0.90 1.02 0.95 0.85 0.96 0.89 0.90 0.37 0.70 0.012 ID3 inhibitor of DNA binding 3 Cfa.64 1.76 1. 0.001 IFI6 interferon, alpha-inducible protein 6 Cfa.20456 1.45 1.36 1.53 0.85 0.85 0.48 0.48 0.48 0.58 0.58 0.73 0.63 0.31 0.20 0.45 0.001 IRF1 interferon regulatory factor 1 Cfa.18304 1.59 1.56 0.83 0.03 0.60 0.50 0.30 0.23 0.47 0.40 0.60 0.45 0.007 IRF2 interferon regulatory factor 2 Cfa.19 0.002 PMPCB peptidase (mitochondrial processing) beta Cfa.290 1.78 1.93 1.62 0.92 0.82 0.68 0.62 0.68 0.73 0.63 0.61 0.62 0.015 PSMB8 proteasome (prosome,macropain) subunit, beta, 8 Cfa.12298 0.89 1.48 1.50 1.22 0.33 0.28 0.71 0.69 0.28 0.02 0.31 0.01 0.001 PSME1 proteasome ( epsilon Cfa.19484 1.53 1.70 1.20 0.93 0.58 0.58 0.47 0.72 0.51 0.34 0.33 0.34 0.22 0.020 STAT1 signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 Cfa.20754 1.38 1.21 1.78 1.32 0.15 0.01 0.63 0.16 0.12 0.08 0.09 0.001 STAT1 signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 CfaAffx.15419 3.49 3.07 IPA canonical complement system pathway analysis at 2 DPI. all genes are significantly differently expressed. expression of IL-6 and seven IL-6 signaling-associated genes increased in ferret lungs as early as 2 DPI and until 7 DPI. fifty IRGs were significantly upregulated in ferret lung tissue during the first 2\u20137 DPI with SARS-CoV relative to mock-infected ferrets. this included CD274, IFI30, IFI44, IFI44L, IFI6, IRF1, IRF2, ISG15, MNDA, OAS2 and PSMB8 genes. ferrets were mock-vaccinated as control or vaccinated using an inactivated whole virus SARS-CoV vaccine candidate formulated with or without Al(OH)3, SARS FCP-A and SARS FCP respectively. edg microarray analysis was then preformed on lung RNA collected at 2, 7 and 28 days post SARS-CoV challenge. of the 3717 significantly altered genes resulting from this combined time course analysis, 42 were identified as IRGs by IPA s were downregulated at least two-fold at 2 or 7 DPC in ferrets previously immunized with SARS FCP-A relative to the mock-vaccinated group. these 8 IRGs included: ISG15 (QRT-PCR shown in Figure S1), GPX1 (an antioxidant enzyme), and PSME1 and 2 (roles in MHC class I antigen processing); and myxovirus resistance 1 (MX1, a potent antiviral) adaptive immunity in the form of SARS-specific antibody production quickly appeared at 3 DPR. a period of IFN-driven innate antiviral responses mediates acute SARS-CoV infection. a protective role for complement in SARS-CoV pathogenesis has been proposed. expression of IL-6 and IL-6 signaling-associated genes increased in ferret lungs for longer period of time than complement genes (2 DPI to 7 DPI) IL-6-regulated genes are mainly induced by IL-6/IL6 receptor signaling via JAK2:STAT3 and the RAS/MAP/NF-IL6 pathway [37] IRF1 is rapidly induced by IFNs and binds to the upstream regulatory region of type I IFN and IFN-inducible MHC class I genes. IRF2, conversely, binds to the interferon consensus sequence and represses IRF-mediated genes. we previously identified dysregulated IFN activity in patients with severe clinical course. antiviral ISG15 derivatives have been shown to be preferred substrates for the deubiquitinating activity of the SARS-CoV papain-like protease [50]. innate immunity correlates are not influenced by tissue viral loads, but that may participate in the IFN-mediated transition from innate to adaptive immunity. the selective abrogated expression of IRGs in vaccinated, vaccinated ferrets reflect the infection-reinfection results. the expression of these genes early in the natural course of infection suggested IRGs to be indicative of an early stage in SARS-CoV disease. the ferret model of SARS-CoV infection showed a two step temporal paradigm of host immune responses in the lung. the lack of repeat robust innate immune responses in the ferrets when reinfected with SARS-CoV suggested that the post-reinfection gene signatures may reveal immune correlates related to successful immunization. ferret studies were approved by the Southern Research Institute\u2019s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. LLRI has Veterinary Medicine tasked to monitor and support all animal experiments. 57 ferrets were assigned to groups: (1) mock vaccine with SARS-CoV challenge (n = 18), (2) SARS-CoV vaccine with no adjuvant and SARS-CoV challenge (n = 18), (3) SARS vaccine with adjuvant and SARS-CoV challenge (n = 18), and (4) mock vaccine\u2013challenge (n = 3). six ferrets from groups one, two, and three were sacrificed at 2, 7 and 28 DPC. all procedures were in accordance with the NRC Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, the Animal Welfare Act, and the CDC/NIH Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories. EDGE was used to identify significantly differentially expressed genes in each of groups one, two, and three using the 2 DPC group 4 datasets as baseline. this included functional pathway analysis, functional pathway analysis and gene annotation. animals were euthanized and the upper and lower left lobes of the lung tissues were harvested and formalin-fixed by perfusion followed by paraffin embedding and sectioning. animals were then stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histopathology assessment. work was reviewed and approved by the LRRI Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee under protocol number 06\u2013017. all infections and sample collections were performed under 5% isofluorane anesthesia. s were assigned to groups: mock vaccine with SARS-CoV challenge (n = 18), mock vaccine\u2013challenge (n = 3) ferrets received a double-inactivated whole virus SARS-CoV vaccine candidate (Baxter Innovations GmbH, Vienna, Austria, Bulk Drug Substance: SA/O/05/01/R/PBDS). RNA quality from one infection-reinfection group four ferret\u2019s 3 DPR lung was insufficient for arraying. EDGE [25] was used to identify significantly differentially expressed genes over all time points for groups two and four (2 DPI \u201328 DPR) using the 2 DPI mocks as baseline, the results of which were combined. animals were euthanized and the upper and lower left lobes of the lung tissues were harvested. the upper and lower left lobes of the lung tissues were harvested and formalin-fixed by perfusion followed by paraffin embedding and sectioning.
