{"summary": "IBV replicates primarily in tracheal epithelial cells, inducing mucosal pathological changes, including ciliary loss, degeneration and necrosis of epithelial cells. viraemia and IBV secondary replication are also found in other respiratory tissues. a recent study has observed differential early immune response after infection with IBV. specific genes, including genes related to innate immune response, were found to be differentially expressed in each chicken line. the innate immune response is the first line of host defense against infections. the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS or NOS2) is responsible for the production of nitric oxide (NO) by macrophages in response against microbial infections. increased levels of this enzyme were associated with high degree of disease severity in chickens infected with avian influenza H5N1 [18], and virulent Newcastle disease [20]. high levels of IL6 gene expression were detected in an IBV-susceptible chicken line compared to the disease-resistant chicken line [22] high level of IL6 gene expression were detected in renal samples of chickens challenged with a nephropathogenic IBV strain. the local cell-mediated immune response was associated with CD3+, CD8+ and other CMI related genes were markedly upregulated later, at 5dpi. IBV field strains were genotyped by automated DNA sequencing of a 1059 bp portion of the S1 gene amplified as described. the deduced amino acid sequences of S1 protein of IBV A and B isolates have 93.16% of identity. birds from groups A, B and NC were randomly euthanized by cervical dislocation, at 1, 5 and 8 day post-infection (dpi) tracheal and renal samples were collected from each group; a portion of each tracheal sample and a fragment of distal left kidney were frozen in liquid nitrogen. the scores of microscopic lesions in the kidney samples were determined as previously described. the parameters evaluated included tubular degeneration and necrosis. the scores ranged from 0 to 3 according to the severity of lesions. the PCR reactions contained 20 ng of cDNA, 7.5 L of 2X Quantifast SYBR Green Master Mix (Qiagen) and 3 M of each primer (Table 1) in a final volume of 15 L. a melting curve analysis was performed by raising the incubation temperature from 65\u00b0C to 95\u00b0C in 0.2\u00b0C increments.

Absence of injury was classified as 0, while mild, moderate and severe were scored as grades 1 to 3. two-step RT-qPCR was used for amplification of the 3 UTR genome region of IBV. samples presenting Cq 36 were classified as positive for IBV. cDNAs were synthesised according to instructions provided with high capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit. mRNAs were digested with 2 L DNAse I (Promega) before cDNA synthesis. efficiency of each specific Real-time PCR was calculated using two-fold serial dilutions of cDNA pooled from all tested animals. 83.64 32.958 Reverse: AGCCATAGCACTTCAACTGTGC TOP2B Forward: AAGGCCAAGAAGATGGAAACTG NM_205082.1 4748\u20134934 187 bp 35/36 91.46 30.668 Reverse: TCTTGGATTTCTTGCATGGTGT TLR3 Forward: TCCATGGTGCAGGAAGTTTAAG NM_001011691.3 2448\u20132575 128 bp 3/4 the relative expression of all tested genes (Table 1) was quantified as the fold change relative to the non-infected group. the stability of the reference genes was tested using four candidates (TOP2B, HPRT1, GAPDH and Histone H3) the best genes were selected using Bestkeeper and Normfinder softwares. the microscopic pathological changes consisted of lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory infiltrate in the mucosa, ciliary loss and epithelial hyperplasia (7 1B) at 8 dpi, lesions were mild, tending to tissue recovery. no relevant microscopic tracheal alterations were observed in the NC group. micrographs show kidney histopathology from chickens infected with IBV. distal fragment of right kidney from the group challenged with IBV. tracheal and renal microscopic lesions showed relevant tracheal. log10 of IBV RNA copies in tracheas from chickens challenged with IBV A isolate and IBV B isolate, collected at 1dpi, 5dpi and 8dpi. log10 of IBV RNA copies in kidneys from chickens challenged with IBV A isolate. all chickens from the challenged groups were IBV positive, with similar virus loads to those detected at 1dpi. the presence and quantity of IBV genome in renal samples decreased at 8dpi in tracheal samples from all IBV challenged groups (A and B) mRNA expression data for TLR3, TLR7, MyD88, iNOS, IFN and IFN in tracheal samples are illustrated in Fig 4. TLR3 was significantly upregulated and peaked at 1dpi in IBV challenged groups. at 5dpi, TLR3 transcripts also remained upregulated in challenged groups. at 8dpi, TLR3 mRNA dropped markedly in challenged groups. the iNOS gene showed a significant increase in mRNA expression at 1dpi. at 5dpi and 8dpi, these transcripts dropped to basal levels. inflammatory responses in trachea IL1 transcripts were significantly upregulated. samples from challenged groups showed upregulation of CD3 and CD4 expression. highest levels of expression of these genes were detected at 5dpi. tracheal lesions observed in groups challenged with IBV isolates at 1 dpi. the most prominent lesions were observed at 5 dpi, with lesion scores ranging from 20 to 30 consisting of tracheitis. the main histopathological changes were degeneration of the mucous glands, lymphocytic infiltration in the mucosa and epithelial hyperplasia. score 3 was only observed in the challenged groups (A and B), at 8dpi. tubular necrosis was not observed in any renal sample from all experimental groups. log10 of IBV RNA copies in tracheas from chickens challenged with IBV A isolate and IBV B isolate, collected at 1dpi, 5dpi and 8dpi. log10 of IBV RNA copies in kidneys from chickens challenged with IBV A isolate and IBV B isolate. tracheal samples were positive at 1 dpi for the presence of IBV genome from chickens challenged with IBV strains. at 5dpi, all chickens from the challenged groups were IBV positive, with similar virus loads to those detected at 1dpi. the presence and quantity of IBV genome in renal samples differed significantly from those of NC group. significantly higher means of IBV genome load (10 to 1000 times higher) were detected in group challenged with IBV B isolate, at 5dpi interval in tracheal samples (P = 0.0041) and at 8dpi in renal samples (P = 0.0041). mRNA expression data for TLR3, TLR7, MyD88, iNOS, IFN and IFN in tracheal samples are illustrated in Fig 4. the iNOS gene showed a significant increase in mRNA expression at 1dpi. at 5dpi and 8dpi, these transcripts dropped to basal levels. inflammatory responses in trachea IL1 transcripts were significantly upregulated. at 5dpi and 8dpi, all tracheal samples from challenged groups showed upregulation of CD3 and CD4 expression. highest levels of expression of these genes were detected at 5dpi. tracheal samples from chickens experimentally infected with IBV. in this study, we found a suppressive effect on expression of early innate and adaptive cell-mediated immune genes in the primary site of virus replication (trachea) from chickens infected with one of the tested IBV isolates (B) this possibly contributed to an exacerbated pathogenicity of this IBV isolate, especially for kidney tissues, but not for A isolate. the authors concluded that other cellular receptors and post-virus binding activation steps could be involved and play a role in the development of IB disease. the attachment of IBV to host cells is considered as the first important step in virus infection and for determining the tissue tropism for this virus. the adapter MyD88 and the pro-inflammatory cytokine gene showed lower levels of expression in the birds from the group challenged with B isolate compared to the group challenged with isolate A. this results demonstrate a differential profile of early type of innate immune responses induced by IBV B isolate compared to the IBV-induced innate immune responses of another study [16]. we hypothesize that the suppressive effect on TLR7 pathway could be associated with enhanced viral replication and induction of lesions for both tracheal and renal tissues. a reduction of expression of CMI-genes for adaptive immune responses was also observed only in the group challenged with IBV B isolate. all cell-mediated immune related genes analyzed here have unaltered expression. ugroup challenged with IBV A isolate showed unaltered levels of CD3 and CD4 mRNA, while IFN and Granzyme homolog A transcripts were significantly upregulated. further studies are required to confirm this association. it remains to be further investigated the differences in the immune responses triggered by the IBV infection with more distinct genotypes of IBV strains. docx)."}
