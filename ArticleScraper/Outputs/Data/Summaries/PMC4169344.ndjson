{"summary": "zoonotic filovirus causes hemorrhagic fever syndrome in humans, with a high case-fatality rate 5. over half of all Ebola infections that have ever been documented have occurred in the context of the current outbreak. occurrence of cases in very large, well-connected urban centers has fueled concerns about the international spread of disease via air travel. nential Adjustment model can be used as a descriptive and prognostic tool for epidemic processes when only limited data (e.g., cumulative incidence curves) are available 1. this model describes epidemic processes both in terms of exponential growth and in terms of simultaneous decay. a discrete-time susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) compartmental model is available when R0 is low or moderate. the model can identify multi-wave epidemics or abrupt changes in control based on sudden changes in the value of the control parameter d (as described below) the model uses the following functional form: where t is scaled in generation time, with R0 the basic reproductive number. the initial reported case count was 42 cases on march 22, 2014. previous reports of R0 for Ebola have ranged from 1.5 to 2.7 2, 4. this cumulative case count was consistent with that seen in approximately the fifth generation of an epidemic process with R0 2. our best fit model identified Ro as 1.78, and d as 0.009. a peak in the epidemic would not occur until April 2015, and continue until mid-2016, with a final size greater than 140,000 cases. however, epidemic size and duration are projected to be extremely sensitive to incremental increases in the size of d. the graph plots best fit values of R0 (blue curve) and d (pink curve) for the IDEA model. a 15 day serial interval is assumed, and first reported cases are assumed to have been reported in generation 5. Graphs show good agreement between the base-case model, fit to overall cumulative incidence data (all countries combined, solid gray curve) vs. summed outputs (solid black curve) from models fit to country-level data from Guinea (dashed black curve), Liberia (thin black curve), and Sierra Leone (dashed gray curve). the \"decay\" parameter (d) defines slowing of growth. this parameter describes the observed tendency of epidemics and outbreaks to end. negligible values for d, as observed in liberia, have been distinctly unusual. under-reporting resulted in very little change in best-fit model parameters. for almost all scenarios evaluated, and for all countries except for Sierra Leone evaluated by single-country models, we found estimates of R0 similar to those that have been reported previously for Ebola outbreaks 2."}
