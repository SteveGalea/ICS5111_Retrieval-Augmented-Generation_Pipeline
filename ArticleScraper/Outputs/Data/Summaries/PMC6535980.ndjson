{"summary": "3.9 billion individuals live in a location endemic for common mosquito-borne diseases. the emergence of Zika virus in south America in 2015 marked the largest known outbreak and caused hundreds of thousands of infections. internet data have shown promise in identifying human behaviors relevant for tracking and understanding other diseases. we have studied the recent outbreak of Zika virus, a mosquito-borne virus that has recently been linked to birth defects and other disorders. we have used a combination of content analysis and supervised machine learning techniques to understand first-person accounts of travel-related decisions during the outbreak. the first outbreaks occurred in 2007 in Gabon and the Federated States of Micronesia. the subsequent emergence of Zika in south America in 2015 marked the largest known Zika outbreak. for the overwhelming majority, Zika is a mild infection; the majority of cases are asymptomatic. studies describe imported cases of diseases that led to large outbreaks as early as the 1500s. genetic data from the 2009 H1N1 outbreak show that the movement of swine around Mexico was responsible for outbreaks in various provinces. study finds air travel could have dramatically changed the 1968 pandemic influenza in Hong Kong [29] et al used tweets from the first 3 months of the outbreak to characterize discourse around Zika. they found that twitter users tended to use public health organizations to find information and did not generally use Twitter as a way to interact with organizations directly. et al investigated information dispersion on Facebook and specifically noted that inaccurate or misleading posts were more popular than those with scientifically sound information. a long-term goal of this study is to incorporate behavior change data into disease-forecasting models. social media data have been used extensively in recent years to study health patterns and better understand infectious disease outbreaks. a particularly successful area of research has used internet data to improve the forecasting of disease outbreaks. an estimated 3.9 billion people live in a location endemic for common mosquito-borne diseases, for example, dengue, chikungunya, and now, Zika [18] we have answered these questions by analyzing a collection of 29,386 English-language tweets filtered for keywords describing Zika and travel. the world health organization (WHO) and PAHO issued alerts in December 2015 about the association between Zika, neurological syndromes, and birth defects. the united states responded to these alerts in mid-january 2016 by issuing a travel advisory for pregnant women. genetic evidence further indicates that H1N1 was probably introduced to the united states from both countries. studies have found evidence that users publicly discuss a variety of ailments. signorini et al observed discussions of behaviors such as hand washing and wearing masks to prevent the flu. zer et al used Instagram to look at image-sharing practices around Zika. they found that health-related images were predominately about transmission and prevention. they suggested that Instagram could be used to track sentiment with regard to Zika. s from march 1, 2015, to October 31, 2016, with about 7 million in English. this collection includes all tweets mentioning Zika and related terms during this time period. a number of English-language tweets describing personal or shared experiences with Zika. the filters also captured tweets that were neither first person nor about travel. we constructed 3 binary classifiers: First person: Tweets where someone makes their own comment related to Zika. this category does not include headlines, promotion or solicitation for articles or events, or generic requests for congresspersons to fund Zika. annotators disagreed on whether promotion or solicitation of articles or events should be in the first-person category. after discussion, we clarified the criteria to exclude those types of tweets. the final labels were selected. the best results were obtained when all features were used (first person and travel consideration) and when the top 70% of features were used (travel change; see Multimedia Appendix 2). the best results were obtained when all features were used. we show both F1 using the pipelined approach (the final classifier) as well as the F1 score if each classifier is built independently. a single bootstrapped estimate of the desired statistic is estimated by resampling the dataset with replacement (bootstrapping) and calculating the statistic from the randomly sampled version of the dataset. a set of 100 users sampled at random for each of the 3 classification categories. for each group, we collected the Twitter timelines of the users and the list of individuals they follow (their followees) using Tweepy [57] to construct comparison groups. tweets were filtered for those that contained (1) at least one of a set of first-person pronouns to target personal behaviors and (2) at least one of a large set of travel-related terms. we included all major airlines in the united states and all airlines with flights to south America [48,49] travel consideration tweets that explicitly express the desire to change travel. tweets that explicitly said the user would not change travel would be labeled as travel change. each category applies to tweets positively labeled with the previous category. we clarified the criteria to exclude those types of tweets. the final labels were selected. the best results were obtained when all features were used. performance results on the held-out test data are shown in Table 2. multimedia Appendix 2 was generated using cross-validation on the training data. the final metrics were generated using the testing data. however, this method resulted in significantly worse F1 scores. a single bootstrapped estimate of the desired statistic is estimated by resampling the dataset with replacement (bootstrapping) the middle 95% of the estimates are taken as a 95% CI for that statistic. using this method, we are able to account for the uncertainty present in the classifier. tweets were preprocessed in the same manner as described in the Classification section. results Applying the classifiers to the keyword-filtered tweets resulted in a final dataset of 13,225 first-person tweets, 3083 travel consideration tweets and 1567 travel change tweets. the spike aligns in time with evidence of local Zika transmission in Florida that was first identified in July 2016 [58] there is an additional peak in the international change tweets in September 2016. these tweets primarily discuss canceling travel to Singapore. we excluded both the Pacific Islands and Caribbean Islands from this analysis because there were not enough tweets classified in these regions. as tweet volume varies by location, we created a type of per-capita estimate to adjust for the overall popularity of Twitter in each region. regions 1, 7, 8, and 10 have the highest relative volume of tweets considering and changing travel plans. Gender was inferred using the Demographer tool [62] which infers gender of Twitter users with an estimated 94% accuracy based on character n-grams of the persons\u2019 names. bars show 95% weighted bootstrapped confidence intervals.

advisories, rather than sustained interest in travel throughout the course of the outbreak. the traditional HHS Regions are regional groupings of states in the united states that are commonly used to aggregate states for health studies. we modified the HHS Regions as follows: R1: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont. regions that included states where Zika transmission occurred were among the lowest in weighted volume of tweets. it could be that individuals in these locations were not tweeting about travel change because they were at a more acute risk of infection. we modified the HHS Regions as follows: R1: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont. we excluded both the Pacific Islands and Caribbean Islands from this analysis because there were not enough tweets classified in these regions (fewer than 50 tweets each) individuals in these locations were not tweeting about travel change because they were at a more acute risk of infection. it is also possible that more granular observations are obscured by aggregation to the HHS level. for each user timeline, we calculated the percentage of tweets that contain a term from the category. we excluded the tweets mentioning Zika so that the analysis does not reflect the same data used to select users. 0.0470 0.0633 0.0680 a Psychological processes Biological

Linguistic Inquiry Word Count) ka followees in each group as well as the number of tweets those followees tweeted that were about Zika. we divide the number of zika followees and number of zika tweets by each user\u2019s total number of followees. this allows us to measure both the raw number of Zika tweets an individual could have been exposed to and the relative likelihood of exposure based on the proportion of their feeds that contained Zika content. individuals who follow many accounts that appear in the dataset are more likely to appear in the travel change group. we did find that those who considered or changed their travel plans had a higher number of followees and tweets that they could have been exposed to in the sample. we find significant differences in the gender distribution of users tweeting about travel consideration and change compared with the general population of Twitter. we also find that the relative proportion of women engaging in conversation indicating travel change behaviors on Twitter is higher than men. a third of women surveyed were not aware of the travel advisories in place during their travel. travel consideration and change users have a statistically higher fraction of zika-related followees and tweets in the sample. this is evidence that exposure to information about Zika may play a role in this decision-making process. limitations of the data and our methodology must also be considered. the data are additionally biased in that data only includes tweets in English. data can be viewed as motivations for larger survey experiments to confirm findings. future work could also aim to validate behavior estimates indirectly by verifying their utility in an external task such as disease forecasting. results of this study show that people do describe first-person behavior changes on Twitter. our behavior change classifier produces a dataset that corresponds to events during the outbreak and shows evidence of geographic and gender-based differences in the behavior change. these data support hypotheses that social media can play a role in an individual\u2019s health choices. we present supervised classifiers that identify evidence of behavior changes with regard to concerns and changes in travel plans owing to Zika on twitter. this is the first work to study a specific behavior change in depth. we examined temporal and demographic patterns in travel behaviors. a third of women surveyed were not aware of the travel advisories in place during their travel. a relatively large number (about one-third) did not know they were pregnant at the time of travel. this is evidence that exposure to information about Zika may play a role. s to the vast literature that uses the Twitter platform to understand health behaviors [4,10,69] the data are additionally biased in that data only includes tweets in English, which are predominately from the united states. we believe our framework could be applied to other behaviors that are only applicable in places with local transmission. we chose not to scale up the annotation process with crowdsourcing. but it is possible that a larger training set could lead to better classifier performance. however, small sample sizes may affect the power of the analyses. research has found that the ways infectious diseases are framed contribute in important ways to the public perception of the event\u2019s severity [76]"}
