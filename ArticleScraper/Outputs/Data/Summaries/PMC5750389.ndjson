{"summary": "this is particularly problematic for RNA viruses because of their high mutation rates, propensity to undergo recombination and/or reassortment, and the establishment of viral quasispecies upon infection. recent advancements in metagenomics and next-generation viral genomic sequencing have exacerbated the problem because of the magnitude of new viral sequences discovered in a multitude of hosts and environmental samples. all python nidovirus and 25.4 kb (Porcine deltacoronavirus HKU15) to 31.8 kb (Bottlenose dolphin coronavirus HKU22) are able to infect a diverse array of vertebrate species. they have a distinct genomic architecture and replication strategy shared with other members of the Nidovirales order. CCoV is a widespread enteric virus of dogs and can occur in highly pathogenic forms. the virus does not manifest itself with FIP-like clinical signs. the coronavirus spike (S) envelope glycoprotein is the main determinant of virus entry. serotype I FCoV and CCoV originated from a common ancestor. a recombination event occurred between a serotype I CCoV and an unknown coronavirus. TGEV appears to have originated from a serotype II CCoV (17) serotype I S proteins contain a cleavage site, the S1/S2 site, not present in serotype II or other alphacoronaviruses. this site has been shown to be important for cell culture adaptation and pathogenesis of FCoV. we propose a classification of Alphacoronavirus 1 strains into two clades (Alphacoronavirus 1 clades A and B) phylogenetic analyses of alphacoronaviruses based on complete genome and ORF1ab protein sequence. trees were aligned with MHV-A59 or the complete protein sequences of the ORF1ab polyprotein of the corresponding viruses (B) CCoV-1-71 prototype strain showed no reactivity to any of the serotype II-specific monoclonal antibodies tested. the whole-genome and ORF1ab phylogenetic tree analyses again show their limitations. a different partitioning of alphacoronavirus 1 strains is revealed. the recombinant CCoV-A76 strain is more closely related to clade A viruses due to its recombinant S protein. a characteristic feature of serotype I FCoV and CCoV is an S cleavage site containing a polybasic furin recognition motif at the junction between the S1 receptor-binding domain and the S2 fusion domain, S1/S2. the lack of an S1/S2 furin site in CCoV-A76 S protein sequence is in good agreement with the complete S, S1 and S2 phylogenetic tree analyses. we propose that the Alphacoronavirus 1 species be subclassified as clade A, corresponding to serotype I FCoV and CCoV, and clade B, corresponding to serotype II FCoV. clades contain FCoV and CCoV strains, while TGEV belongs only to clade B. the proposed classification scheme for alphacoronaviruses is similar to that used to characterize lineages and clades of avian influenza viruses. our alignment analysis of the S1/S2 cleavage site of alphacoronaviruses and its agreement with phylogenetic analyses suggest that the presence of a furin motif consisting of a stretch of basic residues only at the S1/S2 site of clade A viruses could be used for rapid determination of clade inclusion in samples. current criteria based on analyses of key replicase domains allow the definition of coronavirus species. CCoV-23/03 (AKZ66481.1), CCoV-KYNL63-9a (NC_032107.1), HCoV-NL63 (AY567487.2), BatCoV-HKU2 (NC_009988.1), and MHV-A59 (AY700211.1). the following S protein sequences were used to perform phylogenetic analyses based on the spike (S) protein. the following sequences were used to perform phylogenetic analyses based on the spike (S protein) sequence. PhyML was used to generate maximum-likelihood trees based on whole-genome nucleotide, ORF1ab protein, and S protein complete and partial (S1 and S2 domain) alignments. whole-genome, ORF1ab protein, and S protein sequences of the betacoronavirus MHV-A59 were used for rooting phylogenetic trees. minkCoV-WD1127 (HM245925.1), MinkCoV-WD1133 (HM245926.1), BatCoV-HKU8 (NC_010438.1), BatCoV-CDPHE15 (NC_022103.1), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV)-CV777 (AF353511.1), BatCoV-HKU10 (JQ989270.1), BatCoV-KY229E-1 (KY0737 the following S protein sequences were used to perform phylogenetic analyses based on the spike (S) protein. the following sequences were used to perform phylogenetic analyses based on the spike (S protein) sequences. the above-mentioned nucleotide or protein sequences were aligned with Multiple Alignment using Fast Fourier Transform (MAFFT) for each coronavirus species, S protein sequence alignments enabled us to determine the demarcation between S1 and S2 domains."}
