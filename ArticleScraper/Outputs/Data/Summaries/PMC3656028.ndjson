{"summary": "about 25% of transcripts from the GP gene produce the virion-attached or envelope spike GP that is important for entry. EBOV GP contains an unstructured 150-residue mucin-like domain that is heavily modified with O-linked glycans (80 sites) GP1 contains receptor-binding site for host cell attachment. GP2 contains a helical heptad-repeat region, transmembrane anchor (TM) and a 4-residue cytoplasmic tail. each protein has a different C-terminus, leading to different functions. the EBOV GP core structure reveals a surface covered in oligosaccharides. the dense clustering of glycans creates an unfavorable environment for the interaction of otherwise neutralizing antibodies. a number of neutralizing antibodies have been generated against the mucin-like domain. EBOV-infected cells secrete two glycoproteins (secreted GP and shed GP) into an infected person's sera. most of the transcripts encode the 110-kDa, dimeric, secreted GP (ssGP) sGP lacks regions found in GP that have been shown to be important in the neutralization of the virus. most of the antibodies derived from EBOV survivors or macaques are directed towards sGP rather than the virion-attached GP [17], [18] shed GP inhibits the neutralizing activity of EBOV antibodies. retrovirus-derived syncytin-2 retains the immunomodulatory activity associated with the viral envelope glycoproteins. the closely related syncytin-1 is implicated in both cell\u2013cell fusion during placental development and in maternal\u2013fetal tolerance, clearly pointing to a role in immune evasion. soluble recombinant CD74 ectodomain is responsible for increased infectivity of HIV-1. siRNA knockdown of CD74 effectively curbs HIV-1 infectivity [29]. more extensive research is required to generate complete description of viral fusion glycoprotein-associated immunosuppression. the interferon-induced innate viral restriction factor BST-2 (also called tetherin and CD317) is a common target of viral glycoprotein modulation. EBOV and HIV-2 both downregulate BST-2 by interactions mediated through their respective viral glycoproteins [32], whereas HIV-1 makes use of the accessory protein Vpu to achieve this same outcome. perspectives Viruses have developed remarkable mechanisms to inhibit the adaptive and innate immune systems of their hosts. many of these roles and biological pathways are poorly defined. closer examination of viral entry glycoproteins as targets is warranted."}
