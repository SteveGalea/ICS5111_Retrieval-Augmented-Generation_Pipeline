{"summary": "contaminated feed was proposed as a risk factor for PEDV. however, data were not available to support this theory. we provide proof of concept that contaminated complete feed can serve as a vehicle for PEDV infection. contaminated feedstuffs have been proposed as a route of PEDV transmission to nave pigs but its current status is unclear [7] despite lack of evidence, dietary modifications to enhance the biosecurity of feed have been recommended to reduce this perceived risk. all 3 farms experienced an unexpected feed outage from January 6\u20139, 2014. clinical signs became apparent only in the animals that had consumed this feed, i.e. no other signs were noted in other animals consuming other feed from other bins. synthetic woven paint roller pads, 23 cm in length, 0.95 cm nap length, were attached to 3.6 m extension poles to access the cylindrical surface area of bin walls at multiple heights. a 4.4 L plastic bag (Ziploc, SC Johnson & Son Inc, Racine, WI, USA) covered the roller during ascension of the bin ladder. after completion of sampling, the bag was replaced over the roller and the entire sampling apparatus was removed from the bin. a cycle threshold (Ct) of less than 38 was considered PEDV positive. animals were sourced from a PEDV-nave herd and tested on arrival to the ARW via blood sampling and collection of rectal swabs from each pig. 30 grams of feed material from the PCR-positive bin samples were pooled and diluted in 30 mL of sterile phosphate buffered saline. the solution was vortexed for 2 minutes and centrifuged at 16,000 g for 2 minutes. the supernatant was used in the PCR extraction and was then mixed with 454 grams of documented PEDV-free feed. samples were nucleic acid sequenced. tests were conducted using protocols developed and validated by the animal disease research laboratory. monolayers were infected at 0.1 moi of PEDV in MEM containing 2.5ug/ml TPCK-treated trypsin. flasks were frozen at 80\u00b0C until needed. fragments of the PEDV S1 domain were amplified from extracted RNA. clinical history During the period of January 9\u201313, 2014, clinical Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea was diagnosed in 3 breeding herds following acute outbreaks of anorexia, diarrhea and vomiting in isolated groups of sows. all 3 herds emphasized strict biosecurity, using protocols previously validated to reduce the risk of PRRSV infection. feed was collected during the investigation. it was planned to sample the designated bin on each farm to determine if PEDV could be detected in \"at-risk feed\" across all 3 sites, the majority of feed defined as \"at-risk\" had been consumed, leaving the designated bins nearly (or completely) empty. 2% phosphate buffered saline was poured into the bag, immersing the pad and promoting absorption of liquid. liquid was then forced from the pad into the bag and a 10 mL aliquot was decanted into a 15 mL plastic Falcon tube. 8 feed bins across 4 PEDV negative farms were also sampled. negative control group: 4 piglets to be challenged with feed spiked with stock PEDV. piglets were offered free-choice access to challenge material on day 0. feed was withheld from all piglets for 12 hours prior to challenge. piglets across all 3 groups monitored for clinical signs of PED. personnel moved from the Negative control group to the Positive control group. rectal swabs were collected, along with swabs of any detectable diarrhea and vomiting. the one-step real-time RT-PCR amplification conditions started with 15 minutes at 48\u00b0C followed by 2 minutes at 95\u00b0C. the final cycles consisted of 5 seconds at 95\u00b0C and then 40 seconds at 60\u00b0C (data collection step). Positive and negative controls were included on each run. three-day old confluent monolayers of vero 76 cells in 150 cm2 flasks were washed 3 times with serum free minimum essential media. monolayers were infected at 0.1 moi of PEDV in MEM containing 2.5ug/ml TPCK-treated trypsin. flasks were frozen at 80\u00b0C until needed. primer pair 3 and 4 obtained a PCR product size of 678 bp. primer pair 5 and 6 obtained a PCR product size of 565 bp. primer pair 7 and 8 obtained a PCR product size of 745 bp. index cases were located in the west farrowing room of farm B. all samples from on-farm control bins and samples from bins on PEDV-negative sites were PCR-negative. all samples from on-farm control bins and samples from bins on PEDV-negative sites were PCR-negative. farms A, B and C resulted in challenge material having a Ct value of 20.65. PEDV-RNA was detected in a rectal swab from this animal. 1 other piglet displayed clinical signs of diarrhea and vomiting. rhea 18.94 15.48/29.63* Diarrhea 23.19 neg neg 1/22 5 28.89 Diarrhea 16.23 15.79 neg neg neg 1/23 6 15.01/18.94* Vomit 14.59 16.94 neg neg neg 1/24 Nx 5/5 pigs PCR/IHC (+) 4/4 pigs PCR/IHC (+) 2/2 pigs PCR/IHC (+) Nx = Necropsy, small intestinal tracts. DPI a photomicrograph of a jejunal section from a Treatment group piglet shows lesions secondary to PEDV infection. PCR-positive feed challenge material was completed on PCR-positive feed challenge material from both the Positive control group and the Treatment group. no obvious breaches in any of the biosecurity protocols were detected across all 3 herds. index cases were located in the west farrowing room of farm B. the exterior row of stalls in the north gestation room housed index cases for Farms C. all samples from on-farm control bins and samples from bins on PEDV-negative sites were PCR-negative. shedding and clinical signs were observed in the index piglet on day 2 post-consumption with subsequent evidence of viral shedding to 2 other piglets on days 3 and 4. clinical signs, viral shedding or PEDV-positive intestinal tract samples were not observed in the Negative control group. piglets showed loss of condition, rough hair coats, along with clinical signs of PED. piglets demonstrated loss of condition, rough hair coats, along with clinical signs of PED (diarrhea and vomiting) a photomicrograph (400x) illustrates the presence of PEDV antigen in multiple enterocytes following application of immunohistochemical staining. this photomicrograph shows lesions secondary to PEDV infection, i.e. degeneration of enterocytes. the ability to complete a successful swine bioassay using a small number of animals cannot be ignored. however, the fact that our at-risk feed samples were collected from large commercial production sites adds to the credibility of this first attempt to investigate this risk factor. shedding was first detected in an index case and spread occurred throughout the group of piglets. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors\u2019 contributions SD: Developed study, co-wrote paper."}
