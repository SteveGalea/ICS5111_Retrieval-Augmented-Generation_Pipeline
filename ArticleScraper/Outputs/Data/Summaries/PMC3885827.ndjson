{"summary": "mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are a potential source of stem cells that have been shown to be effective in a range of cellular therapies in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. consensus in the field has proposed three minimal criteria to distinguish MSCs from other hematopoietic stem cells. potential functional roles for CD13 in these cells have not been investigated. phenotypically and functionally characterized bone marrow-derived MSC from wild type and CD13KO mice. it is a multifunctional protein with both enzyme-dependent and independent functions that contribute to adhesion, cell migration, angiogenesis, inflammatory trafficking, adhesion, antigen presentation, and endocytosis. 7\u20138 weeks old mice were used for all experiments. bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells isolation and culture MSC were isolated and cultured. Flow cytometric assessment of cellular infiltration was used to characterize the phenotypes of the MSCs. about 1 105 cells were incubated with monoclonal antibodies against mouse CD29, CD49e, CD34, CD45, CD11b at 4\u00b0C for 30 min. the media was changed 2 times per week for 3 weeks. cells were fixed with 10% formalin for 20 min at RT and stained with Alizarin Red, pH 4.1 (Sigma) for 20 min at RT. cell migration and invasion assays were performed using a BD FluoroBlok 24-multiwell insert system. the inserts contain a fluorescence-blocking, 8-m pore size membrane. the fluoroBlok allow quantification of the number of cells that have migrated through the pores by microscope. images were acquired at 20X magnification (2X objective) using a Nikon T-BPA camera attached to the Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U. the software used was SPOT version 4.1. for F-actin staining cells were incubated with TRITC-phalloidin. overnight followed by fluorescence secondary antibody (dilution 1/1000) for 1 h at room temperature. human MSCs were labeled with calcein for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. cells were lysed in 1.0% NP-40 lysis buffer (20.0 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, and 1.0% NP-40) with protease inhibitor cocktail and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail. the right femoral artery was ligated proximal to the deep femoral artery. the deep femoral artery, superficial branches and bifurcation of the popliteal artery were cauterized. postoperative analgesia was provided with buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg) in vivo assessment of impaired use of the ischemic limb (ambulation score) was performed using the following criterion: 3 = most severe, unable to use the foot, dragging foot; 2 = no dragging; and 1 = positive plantar flexion; and 0 = able to flex toes to grasp cage in response to gentle traction on the tail. mice were generated at the Gene Targeting and Transgenic Facility at the University of Connecticut Health Center. all animals were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions with 12 h light/dark cycle and controlled temperature at the University of Connecticut Health Center animal facilities. PCR amplification was performed using invitrogen Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase and other reagents according to manufacturer's instructions. all of the primer sequences were determined using established GenBank sequences. the media was changed 2 times per week for 3 weeks. cells were fixed with 10% formalin for 20 min at RT. cells were stained with 0.5% oil red O (Sigma) for 20 min at RT. MTT proliferation assay of MSCs Cells were plated at a density of 6000 cells/ well/ 200 l in a 96 well plate. cell migration and invasion assays were performed using a BD FluoroBlok 24-multiwell insert system. axiocam MRC camera was attached to Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope. images were taken using a 10x objectives and counted them. the antigen-antibody complexes were detected using a chemiluminescence reagent kit. cells were incubated with SL-13 (dilution 1/500) for mouse CD13 staining; 452 mAb (dilution 1/250) for human CD13 staining; pFAK397 and pFAK925 (cell signaling) for pFAK staining cells were incubated with TRITC-phalloidin (Sigma-Aldrich, 1/100 dilution) for 1 h. fluorescence images were photographed using a 10x, 20X, 40X or 63X objectives. for fluorescence quantification all of the images were acquired at the same exposure. proteins or immunoprecipitates were diluted with 4X sample buffer. resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and electrotransfered onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. blot also stripped for tFAK and -Actin detection. dlimb perfusion was obtained before and 21 days after ligation using a laser doppler perfusion imager. each time point, an average of 4 measurements per animal was made on anesthetized (1.5% isofluorane on an isothermal heating pad) the results were expressed as a ratio of perfusion in the right (ischmic) vs. left [non-ischemic (NI)] limb. ischemic hindlimbs were harvested after 7 days. five fields from four tissue sections were randomly selected. the number of labeled cells was counted in each field. CD13 is not necessary for the formation of MSC in the bone marrow or their short-term survival in vitro after isolation. however, CD13 is required for MSC to differentiate toward some but not all cell lines. lack of CD13 hinders MSC functions in vitro, consistent with a loss in adhesive properties. lack of CD13 hinders MSC functions in vitro, consistent with a loss in adhesive properties. 1 104 cells were seeded in FluoroBlok chambers after 4 h incubation. after 6 h. incubation the cells were counted. CD13 activation induces adhesion and FAK activation in human MSCs. crosslinking of hMSC CD13 with activating mAb 452 induces cell-cell adhesion and FAK phosphorylation in human MSCs. the lack of CD13 on exogenously administered MSCs impairs perfusion recovery in an in vivo hindlimb ischemia model. we removed the femoral artery and collateral vessels from single flanks of WT mice and injected randomized animals with purified WT or CD13KO MSCs or PBS control into the surgery site. mice injected with CD13KO MSC are shown graphically as ratios of blood flow in ischemic limb (I) to that in the non-ischemic limb (NI) at each time point. cumulative results are shown graphically as (C) the ambulatory impairment score; (D) ischemic tissue damage score. a significant increase in muscle regeneration (average) was observed in ischemic gastrocnemius muscles compared with other groups, PBS and KO-MSC. a significant increase in muscle regeneration (average) was observed in WT-MSC group compared with other groups, PBS and KO-MSC. we directly transplanted 2 106 differentially PKH dye-labeled cells of each genotype into the ischemic region of the hindlimb injury. 7 days post-injury/transplantation, hindlimb tissues were collected and analyzed for the number of dye labeled cells remaining in the wound. CD13 regulates the function of transplanted MSCs in the wound. cultured cells of both genotypes expressed equivalent levels of the characteristic cell surface MSC markers. characterization of cultured wild type and CD13KO MSCs showed comparable capacities to form adipocytes and osteoclasts under conditions reported to induce adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation. adipocytes were detected by oil red O staining and osteoblasts by alizarin red staining (Bar = 200 m) 1 105 cells were seeded on Matrigel coated 6-well plates and incubated for 12 h. CD13KO mesenchymal stem cells are functionally impaired. lack of CD13 impairs MSC functions in vitro. lack of CD13 impairs adhesion, proliferation, migration, and invasion. a nearly complete absence of focal adhesions clearly indicate severely disordered adhesion processes. CD13 activation induces adhesion and FAK activation in human MSCs. hMSC CD13 is also prominently expressed in human MSCs. CD13 activation increases monolayer adhesion and FAK phosphorylation in human MSCs. human mesenchymal stem cells express CD13 by immunofluorescence (green); Objective 63X (Bar = 20 m) and immunoblot of human cell lysates. data represents mean s.e.m. n = 3 from two independent experiments. sion in vitro predicts reduced MSC function in vivo. lack of CD13 impairs perfusion recovery in in vivo hindlimb ischemia model. femoral artery removal results in hypoxia that triggers a robust angiogenic response. femoral artery removal results in hypoxia that triggers a robust angiogenic response. femoral artery removal results in hypoxia that triggers a robust angiogenic response. the ratio of capillary density per fiber was measured in ischemic gastrocnemius muscles compared with other groups, PBS and KO-MSC. values are shown as mean s.e.m. (*P 0.05) CD13 was originally identified as a marker of myeloid leukemia and normal hematopoietic cells of the myeloid lineage. it was later discovered to be identical to the cell surface peptidase Aminopeptidase N (Look et al., 1989) unchallenged mice are healthy and fertile with essentially normal hematopoietic profiles and physiologic myeloid functions. this finding is in agreement with previous work demonstrating that CD13 regulates angiogenesis by transducing signals important to the formation of endothelial filopodia. phosphorylation of the critical focal adhesion kinase FAK and subsequent adhesion of CD13KO MSCs to the extracellular matrix is also significantly reduced. phosphorylation of the critical focal adhesion kinase FAK and subsequent adhesion of CD13KO MSCs to the extracellular matrix is also significantly reduced. studies in cardiac cell therapy suggest that only a fraction of the donor cells actually integrate long-term, but rather function more short-term. by 7 days post-injection, ischemic muscles receiving CD13KO MSCs contained significantly fewer labeled cells. this is consistent with reduced survival or retention of cells lacking CD13 at the site of injection. conflict of interest statement The authors declare that research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
