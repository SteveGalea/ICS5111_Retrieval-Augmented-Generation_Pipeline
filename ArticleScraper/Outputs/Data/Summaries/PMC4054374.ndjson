{"summary": "biting insects appear to be the major vector for VSV (1, 2). lesions may result in lameness and weight loss due to difficulty in feeding. transmission of virus from animal to animal is not efficient (4). the virus G protein forms trimeric spike-like projections on the particle surface that enable the virus to dock with a host cell receptor. when the endosome reaches a pH of 6.1, the G protein undergoes a conformational change that fuses viral and endosomal membranes, releasing viral nucleocapsid and associated viral RNA polymerase into the cytoplasm. secondary VmRNA transcription then provides an abundant supply of viral proteins needed for assembly and maturation of a small, simple genome organized in discrete TU has facilitated insertion and robust expression of foreign genes. a strictly cytoplasmic site of replication that does not involve a DNA intermediate greatly reduces the possibility of viral nucleic acid insertion into the host cell genome. the immunogenicity and potential protective efficacy of rVSIV vaccine vectors for a range of human pathogens have been demonstrated. rVSIV/HIV-1 vector and closely related variants were insufficiently attenuated for clinical evaluation (51) rVSIV/HIV-1 vectors were able to elicit cell-mediated immune responses that were similar in magnitude to those induced by the much more virulent rVSIV vector. the wt VSV used in this work as a virulence marker in NV studies was the San Juan isolate, Indiana serotype. all of the attenuated rVSV vectors described for these studies were derived from the rVSV Indiana serotype (27), modified by G gene switching to generate the new Jersey (NJ) serotype (61) where appropriate for immunogenicity studies. p55 open reading frame into an XhoI/NheI expression cassette. to construct vectors encoding temperature-sensitive (ts) mutations in the N and L genes (rVSVtsN+Lgag1), the N and L genes in vector genomic cDNA were replaced with the corresponding genes from mutant viruses. the methods used in this work for recovery of replication-competent rVSV vectors and the propagation-defective rVSVGstem-gag1vector have been described in detail previously. the appearance of cytopathology characteristic of VSV 2 to 7 days posttransfection indicated that rescue had occurred. the purified virus pellet was resuspended in PBS (pH 7.0), flash frozen in an ethanol-dry ice bath, and titrated on i.t. inoculation of rVSV vectors was determined to be free from bacterial and mycoplasma contamination by culture in LB broth and by real-time, quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis. group of six 2- to 3.5-year-old cynomolgus macaques were inoculated i.t. with 107 PFU of virus in 0.2 ml of PBS per animal. 3 animals from each group were necropsied and standard sections of the CNS, including frontal cortex, occipital cortex, thalamus, basal ganglia, cerebellum, and cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spinal cord, were collected and prepared for histological examination as previously described (51). Changes in brain histology profiles were independently scored and peer reviewed by three board-certified veterinary pathologists in blinded fashion. groups of 5 animals anesthetized with ketamine (5 to 10 mg/kg of body weight) and inoculated intramuscularly (i.m.) with 107 PFU of purified virus in 2 ml of PBS (1 ml in each thigh) eight weeks later, animals were boosted by either i.m. or i.n. inoculation with 107 PFU of the corresponding NJ serotype switch vector. a goat anti-monkey horseradish peroxidase antibody (Pierce) diluted 1:10,000 in 1 PBS containing1% BSA was added to each well. color was developed with 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine (Sigma) for 10 min at room temperature, followed by termination of the reaction with 1 N sulfuric acid. color intensity was read at 450 nm, and endpoint titer was defined as the reciprocal of the last serum rVSVn2CT1, rVSVN3CT1, and rVSVMNCPCT1 vectors were modified to express HIV-1 strain HXBc2 gag p55 from an extra TU inserted in the first position of the virus genome. rVSVGstem-gag1 lacking the G gene was generated as described previously (62). rVSVtsN+L vector was cloned back into genomic cDNA. ts phenotype was verified by plaque assay and growth kinetics studies. rVSVtsN+L vector was then modified to express gag gene from first TU in the genome. purified virus pellet was resuspended in PBS (pH 7.0), flash frozen in an ethanol-dry ice bath, and titrated on Vero cell monolayers. NV and immunogenicity studies were performed at Charles River Laboratories, Inc., Preclinical Services. six 2- to 3.5-year-old cynomolgus macaques were inoculated i.t. with 107 PFU of virus in 0.2 ml of PBS per animal. half of the inoculum was delivered to the right and half to the left thalamic region by 25-gauge needle. animals were monitored twice daily for clinical signs of disease, including inactivity, dyspraxia, tremors, and weakness. in the first NV study, total lesion severity was scored on a scale of 0 to 4 as follows: 0, no lesions; 1, slight lesions; 2, mild lesions; 3, moderate lesions; and 5, severe lesions. this altered scale allowed greater scoring sensitivity throughout the range of observed lesions. both inflammatory and necrotic lesion types were separately catalogued. eight weeks later, animals were boosted by either i.m. or i.n. inoculation with 107 PFU of the corresponding NJ serotype switch vector. blood was drawn at weeks 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 9, and 12 postinoculation. nm, and endpoint titer was defined as the reciprocal of the last serum dilution resulting in an optical density at 450 nm (OD450) that was equal to the mean plus 3 standard deviation from that of naive sera. RESULTS Clinical signs of disease following i.t. inoculation of NHPs. only day 7 data are shown for comparative purposes. the effects of combining specific N gene translocations and G gene truncations on viral replication in the absence of foreign gene expression was investigated. in animals receiving wt VSV, abundant viral genomes (109 copies/gram of tissue) were detected proximal to the site of inoculation at day 7 (Fig. 2A), persisting at 6 106 copies/gram of tissue on day 21. SVCT1, rVSVN2CT1 and rVSVN3CT1 genomic RNA detected in the CNS at day 7 postinoculation. by day 21, viral genomic RNA was barely above the level of detection close to the inoculation site in animals receiving rVSVN2CT1. genome copies of the rVSVN2CT1 and rVSVN3CT1 in CNS sections were lower than for rVSVCT1 at day 7. infectious wt VSV was detected in CNS sections at day 7 (1 102 to 1 106 PFU/gram of tissue) and in CSF at day 3 (2.5 102 to 3.9 103 PFU/ml) no infectious virus was detected in CNS sections at days 7 and 21 and in macaques receiving attenuated vectors at days 3, 7 and 21. macaques receiving wt VSV became seriously ill and either died on days 6 to 7 or were sacrificed on schedule at day 7. the data for wt VSV include the findings from five macaques at day 7 and only one macaque at day 21. the individual lesions occurring throughout the CNS were often quite severe. at day 7, macaques receiving the three attenuated vectors had mild to moderate inflammatory responses in brain sections and very slight responses in the spinal cord. inflammatory responses to rVSVCT1 and rVSVN3CT1 were very mild and lower, on average, in brain sections than those on day 7. necrotic lesions predominantly involved ependymal cells lining CSF-filled ventricular canals. inflammatory responses to the further attenuated vectors at days 7 and 21 were typically slight to mild throughout the CNS and little greater than those produced by UV-inactivated virus. each of the rVSV vectors tested expressed HIV-1 gag from gene position one. no significant increase in response above peak postprime levels was observed for any vector except rVSVN4CT1gag1. peak gag-specific CMI response elicited by rVSVN4CT9gag1 and rVSVN4CT1gag1 after i.m. inoculations trended higher than those elicited by the other attenuated vectors. titers for rVSVN4CT9gag1 and rVSVN4CT1gag1 were detected in all but a few animals 22 days postprime, except in those receiving tsN+Lgag1 by the i.n. route. titers were not determined after boosting with the new jersey serotype of each vector. levels of infectious virus and vRNA present in different tissue sections of the CNS at days 7 and 21 postinoculation and in CSF at days 3, 7 and 21 were measured to compare replication efficiency, spread, and persistence among the attenuated vectors. only day 7 data are shown for comparative purposes. the effects of combining specific N gene translocations and G gene truncations on viral replication in the absence of foreign gene expression was investigated. the levels of rVSVCT1, rVSVN2CT1 and rVSVN3CT1 genomic RNA detected in the CNS at day 7 were greatest proximal to the site of inoculation. by day 21, viral genomic RNA was not detected in any brain section from animals receiving rVSVN3CT1. genome copies of the rVSVN2CT1 and rVSVN3CT1 in CNS sections were lower than for rVSV rVSVN2CT1, rVSVN3CT1, and other attenuated vectors were modified to express HIV-1 gag from the first TU in the genome as potential clinical vaccine candidates. the second NV study protocol included animals inoculated with wt VSV for analysis at day 7 but not day 21. no viral RNA was detected in animals receiving UV-inactivated rVSVN4CT1Gag1. macaques receiving wt VSV either died on days 6 to 7 or were sacrificed on schedule at day 21. one macaque had the highest average scores for necrotic lesions. macaques receiving wt VSV had either no lesions or very slight lesions in only a few brain sections. inflammatory responses were greatest at day 7 in animals receiving wt VSV. at day 21, inflammatory responses to rVSVCT1 were higher in spinal cord sections. both animals displayed mild to moderate necrotic lesions, including neuronal necrosis, and inflammatory lesions throughout the CNS. in contrast, all of the further attenuated rVSV vectors caused minimal necrotic lesions localized mainly proximal to the inoculation site and occasionally in spinal cord sections at days 7 and 21. after i.m. priming, most of the highly attenuated rVSV vectors elicited a CMI response that was similar in magnitude to that elicited by rVSVgag5 after either i.n. or i.m. inoculation. however, after i.m. boosting, no significant increase in response above peak postprime levels was observed for any vector except rVSVN4CT1gag1 at study week 0 and boosting at study week 8, the more virulent prototypic rVSVgag5 vector induced a robust gag-specific humoral immune response. postboost humoral responses elicited by the attenuated rVSV vectors were higher following i.m. inoculation than after i.n. inoculation, except for tsN+Lgag1 and rVSVN4CT1g some of the resulting highly attenuated vectors were no longer able to cause disease in a sensitive murine i.c. lethal dose (LD50) model but elicited immune responses in mice that were either equivalent to or greater than those induced by the more virulent prototypic vector (60). the first NV study was designed to determine if the synergistic attenuating effect of N gene translocation combined with G protein cytoplasmic tail (CT) t rVSVN2CT1 and rVSVN3CT1 vectors produced less viral genomic RNA in the CNS than wt VSV. most attenuated rVSVN3CT1 vector tested in this study caused a low level of neurological injury in the CNS. the gag gene was added to rVSVN2CT1, rVSVN3CT1, and rVSVN3CT9 as the first TU in the genome. the rVSVn4CT1gag1, rVSVN4CT9gag1, and rVSVMNCPCT1gag1 vectors caused the lowest level of neuropathology overall. the attenuation of vectors containing combinations of N gene translocations and G gene truncations (rVSVN2CT1, rVSVN3CT1, rVSVN3CT1, rVSVN3CT1gag1) is a methionine-to-alanine amino acid change at position 51 in the M protein prevents the M protein from blocking nuclear export of cellular mRNAs. combination of the MNCP mutation with the CT1 G protein truncation further enhances attenuation. the resulting vector can undergo only a single round of infection in vivo. rVSVGstem-gag1, rVSVN4CT1gag1, and rVSVN4CT9gag1, express either an altered M protein (MNCP) or likely reduced levels of M gene product(s) may be subject to greater control by IFN-mediated pathways and other innate antiviral responses. some of the highly attenuated vectors elicited peak gag-specific CMI responses following i.m. inoculation compared to postprime for each rVSV vector (except for rVSVN4CT1gag1) gag-specific humoral responses were typically boosted above postprime levels. the use of fully heterologous prime-boost vaccination regimens with rVSV and either plasmid DNA or other viral vectors may have restricted replication of boosting virus. rVSVN4CT1gag1, rVSVN4CT9gag1, and rVSVGstem-gag1 vectors elicited gag-specific CMI responses that were similar in magnitude to those induced by the much more virulent prototypic rVSV vector. rVSVN4CT1gag1 and rVSVN4CT9gag1 demonstrated similar attenuation phenotypes and immuno"}
