{"summary": "pigs have the potential to act as a \u201cmixing vessel\u201d for creating novel reassortant influenza viruses that may cause influenza pandemics (6). pigs have the potential to act as a \u201cmixing vessel\u201d for creating novel reassortant influenza viruses that may cause influenza pandemics (6). a pig imported from canada during animal quarantine is not considered a circulating strain in Japan. circulating SIVs have not been monitored closely enough. the ancestral virus lineages had not been isolated from pigs. however, it is critical that the surveillance be globally facilitated. human embryonic kidney 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium. both the gene for human -2,6-sialyltransferase and the PB2 gene from the influenza A virus laboratory strain A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) stably expressed. one of the vRNA-expressing plasmids was transfected into 293T cells with TransIT-293 (Mirus, Madison, WI) and the vRNA-expressing plasmids for the GFP gene-expressing recombinant gene (16) the recombinant gene contains the WSN-derived 3\u2032 PB2 noncoding region, 120 nucleotides of the PB2 coding sequence at the 3\u2032 end, the GFP coding sequence, and culture supernatants containing transfectant viruses were harvested, clarified, aliquoted, and stored at 80\u00b0C until use. the cells were also cotransfected with plasmids for the expression of WSN-derived PB2, PB1, PA, and NP proteins. the neutralizing activity of serum specimens from pigs was determined by using PB2KO virus-based microneutralization assays. pig sera were inoculated into the allantoic cavity of 9- to 11-day-old embryonated chicken eggs and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2 to 3 days. fluorescent immunochromatography-based influenza diagnostic device was specifically modified for detection of influenza A viral nucleoprotein. original device was specific for the H5 HA detection (17) RNAs in the virus-positive allantoic fluids were aliquoted and stored at 80\u00b0C until use. 129 blood specimens were collected from pigs ranging in growing stages from 30-day-old piglets to sows experiencing farrows more than four times in a pig farm. a total of 129 blood specimens were collected from pigs ranging in age from. serum specimens studied Pig growth stage No. of serum specimens collected in: July 2012 November 2012 Growing pig (days old) 30 5 6 60 5 6 90 6 6 120 6 6 150 5 6 180 5 6 210 5 6 Gilt 5 Farrowing sow Once 5 5 twice 5 5 3 times 5 5 4 times 5 5 5 Cells. no pigs involved in this study received SIV vaccines. laboratory strain A/WSN/33(H1N1) (WSN)-based PB2KO gene-knockout (PB2KO) green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing influenza viruses with hemagglutinin (HA) genes from various SIV-related strains. plasmids for the expression of HA viral RNA (vRNA) either from A/duck/Alberta/35/76(H1N1) (the reference strain for H1 subtype the recombinant gene (16) contains the WSN-derived 3\u2032 PB2 noncoding region, 120 nucleotides of the PB2 coding sequence at the 3\u2032 end and the 5\u2032 PB2 noncoding region. the cells were also cotransfected with plasmids for the expression of PB1, PA, NP, NA, M, and NS genes from the WSN strain. pig sera were treated with receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE II; Denka Seiken Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) to remove inhibitors of influenza virus replication and serially diluted (2-fold dilutions, from 10- to 10 27-fold) RNAs in the virus-positive allantoic fluids were aliquoted and stored at 80\u00b0C until use. RNAs were extracted with a high pure viral nucleic acid kit. nucleotide sequences of the HA genes from all avian and swine viruses were trimmed by the closest-neighbor trimming method. 201 sequences for H1 and H3 HA genes were phylogenetically analyzed by using the maximum likelihood method in MEGA 6 software. the nucleotide sequences determined globally were deposited in GenBank under the accession numbers shown in Table 3. the primary target of neutralizing antibodies against influenza viruses is one of the surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA). the HA antigenicity allows influenza A viruses to be classified into 16 HA subtypes (20) in contrast, H4 viruses were sporadically isolated from pigs (22, 23). sera from healthy and nonvaccinated pigs from a broad range of growing stages were collected on farm A, Japan, in 2012. totals of 62 and 67 specimens were collected in July and November, respectively. the neutralizing activity of the pig sera against each PB2KO virus was determined based on the GFP expression in the inoculated cells. most sera from sows showed relatively high neutralizing activity against at least one of the PB2KO viruses. parity numbers showed a positive correlation with neutralizing activity and a positive ratio. a previous report noted that maternal antibodies against SIVs were detectable in pigs up to 10 weeks old. pigs in this particular age population are suitable for SIV isolation in any season. nasal swabs were isolated from a total of 11 specimens from three pig farms. pigs were isolated from a total of 11 specimens from three pig farms. isolates from farms B and L were antigenically indistinguishable by HI assays. the isolates from farm B were the H3 subtype and the rest were the H1 subtype. the isolates from farms C and L were the H1 subtype. a swine virus isolated in 2000 shows the highest homology (94.8%) to MD4 virus in the HA gene sequences. this suggests that the ancestor of the HA gene of MD4 virus was introduced from human populations around the end of the 20th century and has circulated and evolved in pig populations in Japan for more than a decade. the HA genes of both HY5 and YG5 viruses belong to the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus lineage in the phylogenetic tree of the H1 HA genes. however, these viruses share only 95.7% homology with each other and 97.8% homology with the genetically closest isolates in the database in the HA gene sequences. these findings suggest that the ancestor of the HA genes of HY5 and YG5 viruses were introduced we isolated SIVs from this particular age group at a higher incidence than previous reports. we propose that the 90-day-old growing pig-targeted nasal swab collection presented in this study might facilitate global SIV surveillance. the primary target of neutralizing antibodies against influenza viruses is one of the surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) possessed the HA gene from the reference strains of the H1, H3 or H4 virus subtype (Table 2). we also prepared the PB2KO virus counterparts with the HA gene from the H1 or H3 subtype SIV vaccine strain or from an early isolate of the A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses. this improved assay allows not only efficient but also biologically contained detection of neutralizing antibodies. sera of pigs from various stages of growth (Table 1) were collected in July (A and B) and November (C and D) 2012 on farm A. the neutralizing activities of the sera against PB2KO viruses were determined by microneutralization assays in AX4/PB2 cells. seroprevalence data suggest 90-day-old growing pigs are suitable for SIV isolation in any season. nasal swabs were isolated from pigs ranging in age from 90 to 120 days in 11 pig farms. Nasal swab specimens were collected from pigs ranging in age from 90 to 120 days on farms B to K (A) in may and August to September 2013. all SIV-positive specimens from farm L were collected at a single time point, although the specimens in farm L were collected five times over 70 days. these results suggest that active SIV transmission occurs intermittently, rather than continuously, among naive pig populations. the phylogenetic tree of the H3 HA genes revealed that MD4 virus is genetically distinct from general swine H3 virus lineages. a swine virus isolated in 2000, A/swine/Nagano/2000(H3N2), was also genetically close to the contemporary human isolates. the nucleotide sequence of the HA genes from the H3 subtype influenza virus isolated in this study was phylogenetically analyzed with counterparts from the representative swine (), avian () and human () viruses. the licensed H3 SIV vaccine strain A/swine/Wadayama/3/69(H3N2) is indicated by the white arrow. pigs at 90 days old are most susceptible to SIV infection. growing pigs at 90 days old are an ideal age group for SIV isolation."}
