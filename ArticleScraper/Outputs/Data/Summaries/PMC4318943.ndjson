{"summary": "study was part of a prospective longitudinal study of infants in the first year of life. subjects were prescreened for polymorphisms of tumor necrosis factor (TNF308) and interleukin 6 (IL-6174), which we previously found to be associated with AOM susceptibility. study personnel who made AOM diagnosis were trained and experienced otoscopists. UTMB electronic medical record provided optimal capture of URTI, AOM, or lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) episodes. NP swab specimens were available for testing by high-throughput, quantitative, multiplex PCR (HT-qPCR) assay developed for 13 respiratory viruses. adenovirus, bocavirus, coronaviruses 229E, NL63, and OC43; enterovirus; parainfluenza viruses 1 and 3; respiratory syncytial virus (RSV); and rhinovirus. each subject in the study contributed >1 specimen, we used a generalized mixed model with logit link to analyze outcomes of symptomatic episodes. other outcomes of viral detection, multiple viral detection, and AOM were also modeled and tested using the same modeling framework. swabs were collected at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 months, and at 9 months if the subject remained in the study. parents were instructed to report to the study team when the subject developed cold (URTI) symptoms. otoscopic examination and tympanometry were performed. monthly visit with Symptom History Specimens collected during monthly visit without URTI symptoms but history of URTI documented 7 days before or after specimen collection. Asymptomatic Viral Infection Presence of virus(es) in monthly visit specimen without history of symptoms within 7 days of specimen collection, excluding cases with the same virus detected within the previous 30 days. NP swab specimens were collected by trained personnel during the monthly visit by introducing a flocked swab into the nose until resistance was met. the swab was rotated 180\u00b0 and then placed in a 1-mL tube of ESwab transport medium. an aliquot was sent for bacterial culture; the remaining aliquots were kept frozen at 80\u00b0C until testing. a total of 362 subjects (aged 0\u201312 months) yielded 2153 NP swabs or NPS specimens. a retrospective chart review showed that URTI symptoms were present within 7 days before or after specimen collection. 62 Male 195 54 Race White 275 76 Black 82 23 Asian 5 1 Ethnicity Hispanic/Latino 180 50 Breastfed, any duration 237 65 Cigarette smoke exposure 71 17 Daycare attendance 3 1 TNF-308 polymorphism (358 tested) 104 29 IL-6-174 polymorphism (359 tested) 165 46 Subjects followed for 6 mo 41 11 Subjects followed 6 to 12 mo 118 33 Subjects followed for 12 mo 203 56 Total a total of 1079 viruses were detected in 795 (39%) URTI or monthly visit specimens. multiple virus detection occurred more often during URTI samples than samples collected during asymptomatic visits (P.0001) Rhinovirus was the most common and accounted for 40% of all detected viruses. in 567 (71%) specimens, a single virus was detected. 2 viruses were detected in 181 (23%) specimens. 3 viruses were identified in 47 (6%) specimens. 421 specimens from 242 infants were positive for 529 viruses. 328 specimens contained 1 virus, 79 had 2, and 14 had 3. the remaining 403 specimens with positive viruses collected during asymptomatic visits were considered new asymptomatic viral infections. 343 Coronavirus OC43 19 Human metapneumovirus 15 Enterovirus 11 Bocavirus 11 Coronavirus 229E 10 RSV 7 Influenza A 2 Influenza B 0 Infections with 4 viruses 1 Total viruses 502 AOM within 28 d of asymptomatic viral infections 9 AOM attributed to asymptomatic viral infections 0 Abbreviations: AOM, acute otitis media; RSV, respiratory syncytial virus. there were 9 AOM cases within 28 days of specimen collection. the subjects developed URTI 8\u201322 days after asymptomatic specimen collection. however, URTI episodes were attributed to URTI and not from prior asymptomatic viral detection. viral load in URTI specimens with AOM complication, URTI without AOM, monthly visits with symptom history, and asymptomatic monthly visit specimens was 2.85 105, 3.63 105, 2.5 104, and 2.00 104 copies/mL respectively. there was no significant difference in viral load in URTI groups (with or without AOM), compared with the other groups (P.00001). in 125 of 394 (32%) URTI episodes, NP swab or NPS specimens were collected twice (average of 4 days apart) because subjects developed AOM or continued to have symptoms. a retrospective chart review showed that URTI symptoms were present within 7 days before or after specimen collection. symptomatic 147 9 Monthly specimens, asymptomatic 1487 91 Total number of specimens tested for viruses 2153 Total URTI and monthly visit eventsa 2028 Abbreviations: IL-6, interleukin 6; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; URTI, upper respiratory tract infection. a Virus results were combined for 125 episodes for which 2 specimens were collected. a total of 1079 viruses were detected in 795 (39%) URTI or monthly visit specimens. multiple virus detection occurred more often during URTI than samples collected during asymptomatic visits. both positive virus detection and multiple virus detection increased with age. Detection of RSV, influenza, rhinovirus, metapneumovirus, and adenovirus were highly associated with symptoms, with odds ratios >4. asymptomatic Respiratory Viral Infections Characteristics of 403 asymptomatic viral infections in 237 infants are shown in. there is a higher rate of asymptomatic virus detection during the galveston non-RSV season (April to August, P =.04); this high rate is more pronounced in late spring and early summer (April to June, P =.000087). symptomatic infection includes upper respiratory tract infection episodes and monthly visits with symptom history. characteristics of infants in these 4 groups shown in Supplementary Table 3A. factors not associated with symptoms included race, ethnicity, TNF308 and IL-6174 polymorphisms, breastfeeding vs formula feeding, cigarette smoke exposure, and daycare attendance. symptomatic Viral Detection Type of Viral Infection Total Cases AOM % Average Days After URTI Median Days By Virus AOM % Average Days After URTI Median Days By Virus AOM % Average Days After URTI After URTI After URTI episode 394 105 27 6 4 Positive 86 29 5 4 Negative 19 20 6 5 Monthly visits, symptom history 147 6 4 10 7 Positive 2 3 7 7 Negative 4 5 12 9 Monthly visits asymptomatic viral infection was associated with young age, male sex, low viral load, bocavirus, enterovirus, and single virus detection. to our knowledge, this is the largest series describing asymptomatic respiratory viral infections in infants. URTI symptoms in infants associated with host and virus factors. infants 6\u201312 months of age expressed more symptoms than younger infants. ages of 6\u201312 months were a risk factor for symptoms. bocavirus may partially explain lack of association between symptoms and this virus detection. asymptomatic viral infection did not lead to AOM. a necessary step in pathogenesis of AOM is inflammation of the nasopharynx and the Eustachian tubes severe enough to cause URTI symptoms.
