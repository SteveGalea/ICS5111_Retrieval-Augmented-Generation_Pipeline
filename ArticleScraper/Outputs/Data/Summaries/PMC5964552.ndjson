{"summary": "TB is one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide [1]. it spreads from person to person through the air. many scientists studied codon usage patterns [2], promoter architecture of toxin-antitoxin systems [3], drug-resistance [4], molecular epidemiology [5], protein function and immunogenicity [6], and drugs for the treatment [7] of TB. the codon usage index (CBI), the effective number of codons (ENC), the overall GC content, the codon adaptation index (CAI) and the Frequency of Optimal Codons (FOP); (2) mutation and evolution characteristics via the relationship between ENC and the GC3 of the whole 12 Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes. a total of 12965 coding sequences for Mycobacterium tuberculosis are selected. ENC was calculated using the following formula [19]: E N C a l c u l a t i e d = 2 + 9 f 2 + 1 f 3 + 5 f 4 + 3 f 6, (1) where f - k (k = 2,3, 4,6) is the mean of fk values for the k-fold degenerate amino acids; f - k denotes the average homozygosity for the amino acid RSCU values represent the ratio between the observed usage frequency of one codon in a gene sample and the expected usage frequency in the synonymous codon family. the synonymous codons with RSCU values > 1.0 have positive codon usage bias and were defined as abundant codons. those with RSCU values 1.0 have negative codon usage bias and were defined as less-abundant codons. the value of the CAI falls between 0 and 1; larger value denotes the larger bias of the codon usage. the codon bias index reflects the presence of components with high codon usage in a particular gene. the value of CBI has been widely used for it can more clearly describe the foreign gene expression in the host. neutral evolution analysis could be performed to determine and compare the extent of influence of mutation pressure and natural selection. in this work, the neutral evolution analysis of the codon usage pattern of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is conducted and analysed by plotting the GC12 values of the synonymous codons. fk is the mean of fk values for the k-fold degenerate amino acids; f - k denotes the average homozygosity for the amino acid class whose degree of codon degeneracy is k. the coefficients 9, 1, 5, and 3 denote the number of amino acids belonging to different classes. codons with RSCU values > 1.0 have positive codon usage bias. those with RSCU values 1.0 have negative codon usage bias. the value of the CAI is between 0 and 1; larger value denotes the larger bias of the codon usage. Nran represents the sum of the number of occurrences of the superior codon when all the synonymous codons are random in a certain protein; Ntot represents the occurrence number of the amino acid corresponding to the superior codon in the gene. in this work, the CBI of genes for mycobacterium tuberculosis genome is calculated and analyzed. bacterium tuberculosis is conducted and analyzed by plotting the GC12 values of the synonymous codons against the GC3 values. in order to minimize the effect of amino acid composition on codon usage, the three stop codons and two particular amino acid codons, AUG and UGG, are excluded. every point represents one coding gene in Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes. the value 20 denotes the codon usage bias using only one possible synonymous codon to correspond to an amino acid. the frequency of using all possible synonymous codons may tend to be equal. each point shown in Figure 3 represents one separate gene for the Mycobacterium tuberculosis. the distribution of most GC12 rate is between 0.5 and 0.65. most of the GC3 rate is during 70%\u201390%. the overall RSCU values of 12 Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes are calculated. the codon usage bias shows that the red bars in those RSCU values are more than 1.5, which could be regarded as the abundant codons. the blue bars in Figure 4 are showing the opposite characteristics which could be called the less-abundant codons. RSCU values of 12 separated Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes are separately shown in Figure 5. There is some difference between all genomes especially in the usage of CUU, GUG, ACC, GAU, CGG, GGC, and so on. the GC3 content of either GC12 or GC3 tends to increase slightly. but within the lengths between 1000 and 2000 nucleotide residues, the GC-contents (GC12 and GC3) are not obviously varied with the gene length. only proteins of less than 1500 amino acids in length are considered. previous studies indicated that genetic diversity exists in Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated from different tuberculosis [35] when the samples are from different areas. many studies also revealed that the host is an important factor that can affect the codon usage characteristics. codon usage patterns in mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes are influenced by GC3 bias. correlation between codon bias index and GC3 (=0.618) shows that codon usage bias exists in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes."}
