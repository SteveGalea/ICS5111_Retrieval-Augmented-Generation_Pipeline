{"summary": "a monogamous continuous-breeding system was used to generate pups for this study. 22 clinically normal rice rats were selected for this study. all rats were housed in static filter-top cages with pine shavings. sentinels and randomly chosen rice rats were euthanized and necropsied every 4 wk to monitor for the presence of clinical disease, pathogens, and antibodies to infectious agents. rats were moved to a conventional facility and continued to be monitored by using a quarterly cycle sentinel program. rats were exposed to soiled bedding from rice rat cages for a minimum of 6 wk before necropsy, serology, and parasitology analysis. is, Encephalitozoon cuniculi, and Helicobacter spp monitored for fur mites and pinworms annually. superficial skin scrapes, perianal tape tests and zinc sulfate fecal flotation preparations were routinely examined microscopically. direct pelt and cecal content examinations were performed in euthanized rice rats and sentinels. ketamine\u2013midazolam (greater than 50 mg/kg IP, greater than 5 mg/kg IP) produced unpredictable acute mortality and respiratory distress in surviving animals. after these observations, procedures were suspended. veterinary staff was consulted regarding recommendations to improve survival and reduce respiratory distress. male and female rats were consolidated into a single group because no sex-associated differences were observed. the anesthetics were administered in the following order: 1) isoflurane, 2) ketamine\u2013dexmedetomidine (50 mg/kg IP, 0.125 mg/kg IP), and 3) ketamine\u2013xylazine (50 mg/kg IP, 4 mg/kg IP) only 3 rats were tested each day. procedure was divided into stages previously defined in genus Rattus6. induction, time from administration of the anesthetic to loss of the righting reflex. surgical tolerance, time from absence of TP reflex to point when isoflurane-treated rats were withdrawn from inhalant. rice rats were anesthetized with isoflurane by using a laboratory animal anesthesia machine (VetEquip, Vivermore, CA) rats were placed in an induction chamber which was filled with isoflurane (4% v/v) and oxygen until loss of the righting reflex (1.5 to 2 min) rats were placed on the surgical platform and a nasal cone was placed on their noses. rats were anesthetized with isoflurane at 4% (v/v) for induction and 2% to 3% (v/v) for maintenance. the second maxillary molar (M2) was extracted by using dental explorers and toothed tissue forceps as previously described for genus Rattus4 but with minor modifications. each tooth extraction procedure lasted 20 to 30 min. rats were placed in sternal recumbency in a clean recovery cage. rats ate pelleted rodent chow (Teklad LM485; weight, 28 g or greater; body condition score, 3.0 or greater)53 were selected for this study. all rats were housed in static filter-top cages with pine shavings as bedding and continuous access to food and water. sentinels were exposed to soiled bedding from rice rat cages for a minimum of 6 wk before necropsy, serology, and parasitology analysis. at least once every quarter, we surveyed for mycoplasma pulmonis by serology and for fur mites and pinworms through tape tests. fate fecal flotation preparations were routinely examined microscopically for the presence of ecto- and endoparasites in breeders and experimental animals. direct pelt and cecal content examinations were performed in euthanized rice rats and sentinels. justification for the selected anesthetics and doses were selected according to data published for other rodent species. atropine had the longest half-life (3 h) among the drugs used in this study. atropine had the longest half-life (3 h) among the drugs used in this study. rats were placed on a warmed surgical platform in dorsal recumbency. the TP reflex was monitored after anesthesia induction by using forceps to pinch the skin between the toes of the hindlimbs and observing whether the limb was withdrawn. the TP reflex was monitored every approximately 2 min throughout the procedure. the time from the end of the surgical tolerance stage to the time when rats regained the righting reflex and first became ambulatory. rectal temperature (in \u00b0C), SpO2 (SpO2 as percentage) and heart rate (bpm) were monitored. rats were placed in an induction chamber filled with isoflurane (4% v/v) and oxygen. a nasal cone was placed on their noses to continue isoflurane administration. rats were weighed and subcutaneously injected with atropine sulfate. rice rats were anesthetized with isoflurane at 4% (v/v) for induction and 2% to 3% (v/v) for maintenance. rats received a subcutaneous injection of meloxicam (2 mg/kg daily) to reduce postoperative pain. the head was secured by placing a surgical wire caudal to the maxillary incisors. rice rats that underwent tooth extractions were examined daily for signs of pain or distress for 72 h after extraction. moist chow and purified soft diet were offered to the rats during the first 5 d after extraction. ketamine\u2013dexmedetomidine treatment showed a trend towards a longer nonsurgical tolerance stage than isoflurane. rats recovered faster (P 0.05) after isoflurane administration (4 1.2 min) compared with ketamine\u2013xylazine (11.1 7.4 min) but not ketamine\u2013dexmedetomidine (8.4 6.3 min; Figure 1). rice rats were considered to be in the surgical tolerance stage as soon as the TP reflex was negative (red rectangles) only 5 rats elicited sporadic, positive TP reflex events (green rectangles), which were abolished by temporarily (less than 2 min) increasing the concentration of isoflurane from 2% to 3.5%. ketamine\u2013xylazine-injected rats displayed isolated or consecutive positive TP reflex events throughout the surgical tolerance stage. one rat died that was treated with ketamine\u2013dexmedetomidine and that received supplemental ketamine after a positive TP reflex. another rat, treated with ketamine\u2013xylazine, also died. ketamine\u2013dexmedetomidine (orange) resulted in sustained rectal temperature until the end of the procedure. rectal temperature was significantly decreased under ketamine\u2013dexmedetomidine (orange) and ketamine\u2013xylazine (gray) at the last 2 time points of the surgical tolerance period. rice rats were placed on a heated surgical platform in dorsal recumbency and stabilized by using a custom-made support device. the head was stabilized by placing surgical wire affixed to 2 magnetic stabilizers caudal to the maxillary incisors. a pulsimeter was placed on the foot to measure SpO2 and heart rate. ketamine\u2013dexmedetomidine treatment showed a trend toward a longer nonsurgical tolerance stage than that for isoflurane. rats recovered faster (P 0.05) after isoflurane administration (4 1.2 min) compared with ketamine\u2013xylazine (11.1 7.4 min) but not ketamine\u2013dexmedetomidine (8.4 6.3 min; Figure 1). only 5 rats elicited sporadic, positive TP reflexes (green rectangles) only 5 rats elicited sporadic, positive TP reflexes (green rectangles) ketamine\u2013dexmedetomidine and ketamine\u2013xylazine-injected rats showed isolated or consecutive positive TP reflex events throughout the surgical tolerance stage. rice rats were treated with ketamine\u2013dexmedetomidine and received supplemental ketamine after a positive TP reflex. another rat, treated with ketamine\u2013xylazine, also died. ketamine\u2013dexmedetomidine (orange) and ketamine\u2013xylazine were stable. SpO2 was within 96% to 99% in all rats with the 3 anesthetics during the complete surgical tolerance stage. ketamine\u2013dexmedetomidine- and ketamine\u2013xylazine-treated rats were lower than isoflurane-treated rats. isoflurane produced a shorter induction time and more rapid entry into the surgical tolerance phase of anesthesia. ketamine\u2013dexmedetomidine and ketamine\u2013xylazine anesthesia were partially reversed by injecting atipamezole to block the effects of dexmedetomidine and xylazine. rice rats were considered to be at a surgical level of anesthesia when the TP reflex was negative (red rectangles) 55% of rats treated with ketamine\u2013dexmedetomidine and 60% of ketamine\u2013xylazine-injected showed isolated or consecutive positive TP reflex events throughout the surgical tolerance stage. ketamine\u2013dexmedetomidine and ketamine\u2013xylazine induced significant, sustained decreases in rectal temperature after 35 min. for all anesthetic regimens, SpO2 values were consistently 95% to 99% in all rats throughout the entire surgical tolerance stage. both respiratory and heart rates were consistently stable throughout the surgical tolerance phase regardless of anesthetic modality. isoflurane is the most effective and reliable among the 3 modalities to use for surgical procedures lasting 30 to 35 min in rice rats. we performed maxillary tooth extraction in a group of female rice rats to determine feasibility of isoflurane administered through a nasal cone. isoflurane is the most reliable and effective anesthetic modality for maintaining a surgical plane of anesthesia for as long as 30 min in rice rats. compared with ketamine\u2013dexmedetomidine and ketamine\u2013xylazine, isoflurane had a shorter period of induction and rats recovered faster. rane exerts only a moderate cardiodepressive effect compared with the more pronounced depression induced by injectable agents. isoflurane levels of 1.5% (v/v) result in mean arterial pressure and heart rate values comparable to those of alert, unanesthetized C57BL/6 mice. isoflurane caused mild hypotension, whereas ketamine\u2013xylazine was less suppressive on blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature. ketamine\u2013dexmedetomidine and ketamine\u2013xylazine did not provide a consistent surgical depth level of anesthesia in many strains of mice and some rat strains. ketamine\u2013dexmedetomidine and ketamine\u2013xylazine effectively maintained the surgical depth stage of anesthesia in only 45% and 40% of the rats. postmortem examination of the rats that died during the preliminary test revealed the presence of foamy fluid in the lumen of the tracheas and lung. histopathologic examination revealed congestion of kidneys, liver, and lungs. veterinary staff recommended the addition of atropine, which reduces bronchial secretions and protects the heart from vagal stimulation. ketamine and atropine could have induced receptor sensitization in the rats that influenced subsequent sedation. frequent use of 2-adrenoceptor agonists can mask pain responses in some species. carryover analgesic effects at peripheral, spinal, and brainstem sites might have been present during the second exposure. dexmedetomidine and ketamine\u2013xylazine, isoflurane anesthesia administered through a nasal cone is a reliable and effective anesthetic modality. our study demonstrates variability in these anesthetic modalities."}
