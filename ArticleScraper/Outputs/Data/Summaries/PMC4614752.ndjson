{"summary": "disproportionate contributions to acquiring or spreading pathogens have been termed \u2018super-receiving\u2019 [4] and \u2018super-spreading\u2019 [5], respectively. there is growing interest in identifying which individuals will be super-receivers or super-spreaders in both human and wildlife populations. house finches (Haemorhous mexicanus) has been host to an emerging clade of MG. MG causes severe conjunctivitis and has been associated with population declines. this pattern is strongly associated with the social behaviour of non-breeding house finches. gregarious individuals likely come into contact with more conspecifics. agonistic interactions are the primary source of direct contact during the non-breeding season. we predicted that finches using feeders more often would be more likely to show conjunctivitis if indirect transmission is most important. we estimated the local population size to be 364 (see the electronic supplemental material), suggesting that we marked roughly 49% of the population. 32% of the population (n = 117 detected via RFID) contributing to our social network. birds were housed overnight for a separate study. house finches in the eastern US depend heavily upon feeders. these sites are the primary source of contact during the non-breeding season. flock membership inferred from feeders predicts the spread of information through populations. adjusted group size was defined as the number of marked individuals in each foraging flock divided by the total number of marked individuals detected that day. for each individual, we calculated the average number of total displacements in which that bird was involved per day. we also calculated the average number of unique individuals per day with which a focal bird was involved in displacements. model-averaged parameter estimates and relative importance of variables in generalized linear models of the risk of mycoplasmal conjunctivitis in the wild. the dependent variable was whether an individual was ever detected as diseased (1) or not (0). eigenvector centrality 3.30 (22.62 to 16.04) 0.33 relative dominance 0.55 (4.33 to 5.43) 0.25 number of unique individuals w/which interacted aggressively per day 0.61 (3.78 to 2.55) 0.24 sex (males) 1.09 (2.89 to 0.71) 0.18 (unknown, n = 1) 14.13 (4800 to 4772)) feeders visited per day 0.61 (10.60 to 9.39) 0.09 feeding bouts per day we quantified transmission dynamics in 10 single-sex flocks that differed only in the behaviour of the initially infected individual. in the other half, we infected the individual that spent the least time on the feeder. no birds showed clinical signs of mycoplasmal conjunctivitis, which has not been reported in this region. we inoculated either the bird that spent the most time on the feeder (high-feeding index flocks) or the bird that spent the least time on the feeder (low-feeding index flocks) because within-group variation in time spent on the feeder differed among flocks, we balanced our treatments across low-, mid- and high-variance flocks. qPCR analyses defined initial transmission as the first day on which any non-index bird showed pathogen load above a given number of copies of the mgc2 gene. the first cut-off value was one copy; the second was 1349 copies, which reflects an estimate of the minimum infectious load in this system. this distribution makes minimal assumptions about the risk of transmission over time [56] s were close enough that birds could use all six (maximum distance between sites = 2.3 km), though most individuals used fewer (median = 2, range = 1\u20133) we estimated the local population size to be 364 (see electronic supplemental material), suggesting that we marked roughly 49% of the population, with 32% of the population contributing to our social network. behavioural metrics from radiofrequency identification data were quantified using our RFID data. house finches depend heavily upon feeders during non-breeding season. behavioural interactions at feeders are particularly relevant to pathogen transmission. these metrics reflect a bird's local connectedness and network-wide connectedness, respectively, and are predictive of information acquisition [38] and infection in other wildlife systems [6\u20138]. we calculated each bird's average adjusted group size. the dependent variable was whether an individual was ever detected as diseased (1) or not (0). we used generalized linear models with binomial error distributions in R [46]. number of captures 0.82 (0.25 to 1.89) n.a.; contained in all models time spent on feeders per day 0.17 (0.019\u20130.32) 0.87 weighted degree 3.30 (7.46 to 0.87) 0.53 average adjusted group size 21.90 (28.54 to 72.34) 0.34 eigenvector centrality 3.30 (22.62 to 16.04) 0.33 relative dominance 0.55 (4.33 to 5.43) 0.25 number of unique individuals w/ we captured and marked 180 individuals, of which 117 were detected via RFID at least once and 35 were physically recaptured. the local population size is estimated to be 364 (see the electronic supplemental material), suggesting that we marked roughly 49% of the population. feeders were tube-type, with two feeding ports. below each port, we placed an RFID antenna, connected to a reader. the reader logged one data-point per second. we calculated each bird's position within the social network using weighted degree and eigenvector centrality in the sna package for R. these metrics reflect a bird's local connectedness and network-wide connectedness, respectively, and are predictive of information acquisition [38] and infection in other wildlife systems. we limited our final analysis of disease risk to individuals detected by RFID on 7 or more days (n = 76, 35 of whom were also physically captured multiple times) the dependent variable was whether an individual was ever detected as diseased (1) or not (0). we used generalized linear models with binomial error distributions in R. parameter model-averaged parameter estimate (95% CI) relative importance normalized model-averaged parameter estimate (95% CI) intercept 4.29 (8.04 to 0.54) n.a. contained in all models number of captures 0.82 (0.25 to 1.89) n.a.; contained in all models number of captures 0.82 (0.25 to 1.89) n.a. experimental epidemics in captivity designed to test whether time spent on feeders also predicted super-spreading. we quantified transmission dynamics in 10 single-sex flocks that differed only in the behaviour of the initially infected individual. index birds were chosen based on the time they spent at the feeder during the prior week. we inoculated either the bird that spent the most time on the feeder (high-feeding index flocks) or the bird that spent the least time on the feeder (low-feeding index flocks) al swabbing for quantification of MG load by qPCR using previously published methods. first, based on eye scores, initial transmission was defined as the first day on which any non-index bird showed eye score above 0. second, because it is unknown whether transmission of MG can occur when birds are subclinical and because low false-positive values can occur with our highly sensitive qPCR assay. experimental design Because time spent on feeders was the most important predictor of super-receiving in this system, we designed experimental epidemics in captivity to test whether time spent on feeders also predicted super-spreading. we quantified transmission dynamics in 10 single-sex flocks that differ only in the behaviour of the initially infected individual. isepticum inoculation and treatment groups After two weeks in flocks, one bird per flock (\u2018index\u2019) was inoculated in each conjunctiva with 40 l of a solution of Frey's medium containing 2 105 colour changing units of MG. index birds were chosen based on the time they spent at the feeder during the prior week. some flocks had consistent high-feeders, while others had consistent low-feeders. PCR used previously published methods to determine initial transmission event within each flock. first, based on eye scores, initial transmission was defined as the first day on which any non-index bird showed eye score above 0. second, because it is unknown whether transmission of MG can occur when birds are subclinical and because low false-positive values can occur. social network position We found limited support, in the opposing direction of our prediction, that social network position predicts risk of mycoplasmal conjunctivitis. weighted degree had a relative importance of 0.53 (table 1; electronic supplementary material, table S3) but the 95% confidence interval for this variable overlapped zero. the total time that free-living house finches spent on feeders per day positively predicted the probability of mycoplasmal conjunctivitis. total time spent on feeders was the only variable whose 95% confidence interval did not overlap zero. exclusion of the rightmost point yielded nearly identical model predictions. epticum progress more rapidly in flocks where the bird spending the least time on the feeder is experimentally inoculated. when pathogen transmission is defined as the first occurrence of clinical signs (a) or the first detection of the estimated minimum infectious pathogen load (b) in an originally naive animal, this pattern is highly significant. however, when transmission is defined as any detectable pathogen load, no differences between groups appear (c) social network position predicts risk of mycoplasmal conjunctivitis. weighted degree had a relative importance of 0.53. but the 95% confidence interval for this variable overlapped zero. foraging behaviours We found strong support for our prediction that foraging behaviours are important for disease risk in this system. the total time that free-living house finches spent on feeders per day positively predicted the probability of mycoplasmal conjunctivitis. male flocks tended to have more rapid transmission than female flocks. epidemics of M. gallisepticum progress more rapidly in flocks where the bird spending the most time on the feeder is experimentally inoculated. however, when transmission is defined as any detectable pathogen load, no differences between groups appear (c). individual birds were consistent in their relative levels of feeder use both before and after inoculation (ICC; (experimentally inoculated birds only) = 0.67; electronic supplementary material, figure S2; ICC (including all birds) = 0.67. in addition, high- and low-feeding index birds did not differ in the magnitude or time course of eye score or pathogen load. eigenvector centrality did not occur in any of the top three models. the signs of the parameter estimates were opposite, suggesting weak or inconsistent effects. results from social network metrics suggest that birds in larger groups may have had higher risk of mycoplasmal conjunctivitis. high-feeding index flocks showed a significantly shorter time to initial transmission than low-feeding index flocks. male flocks tended to have more rapid transmission than female flocks. individual birds were consistent in their relative levels of feeder use both before and after inoculation (ICC; (experimentally inoculated birds only) = 0.67; electronic supplementary material, figure S2; ICC (including all birds) = 0.67, data not shown. high- and low-feeding index birds did not differ in magnitude or time course of eye score or pathogen load. the presence of tube-style bird feeders was associated with increased prevalence of mycoplasmal conjunctivitis at the backyard scale. the extent to which a house finch interacts with feeders in the wild predicts its likelihood of displaying mycoplasmal conjunctivitis. we found little evidence to suggest aggressive interactions were strongly predictive of disease risk. study of captive house finches showed healthy individuals prefer feeding near MG-infected conspecifics. another study found finches can avoid birds actively mounting an inflammatory immune response. time spent on bird feeders plays a more critical role in MG dynamics in wild birds than social network position or aggressive interactions. feeding behaviour of infected individuals also predicts the likelihood of transmitting MG to susceptible flockmates. differences in pathogen load or pathology could have influenced pattern of transmission, but neither factor differed between high- and low-feeding index birds. however, dominance status correlated with time spent on feeders. field and captive results suggest that in this system, the same behaviour (feeder use) is important for both acquisition and transmission. the highest risk of both acquiring and spreading a pathogen would be concentrated in the same individuals. the highest risk of both acquiring and spreading a pathogen would be concentrated in the same individuals. authors' contributions J.S.A., S.C.M. and D.M.H. designed and executed observations and experiments and wrote the paper.
