{"summary": "picornaviridae family consists of 35 genera and 80 species, mainly including Enterovirus, Hepatovirus, Cardiovirus, Aphthovirus, and Rhinovirus. EV71, CVA16, and CVA10 cause hand, foot, and mouth disease in millions of children in Asia-Pacific region each year. viroporins are proteins found in a variety of viruses and are generally comprised of 50 to 120 amino acids. each viroporin contains a highly hydrophobic domain capable of forming at least one amphipathic -helical structure. the 2B protein plays a key role in the picornavirus life cycle by inducing a series of cytotoxic reactions. the 2B protein belongs to the type II family of viroporins. in type IIA viroporins, the N- and C-termini stretch to the organelle lumen. the N- and C-termini of type IIB viroporins face the cytoplasmic matrix. the majority of 2B proteins are localized to organelles, with predominant co-localization with the Golgi apparatus and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) the majority of 2B proteins are localized to organelles, with predominant co-localization with the Golgi apparatus and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resulting in an obvious decrease in Ca2+ of the ER and the golgi complex, along with a decrease in calcium uptake by the mito the 2B protein may change the membrane permeability of target cells. changes in membrane permeability have also been suggested to be regulated by the content of specific membrane phospholipids. however, the role of the 2B protein in Ca2+ homeostasis remains unclear. the 2B protein may change the Ca2+ concentration to regulate autophagy and apoptosis. the 2B protein is capable of binding to the membrane and inducing target membrane remodeling to form a unique membrane structure that can serve as a viral replication site. the 2B protein is capable of binding to the membrane and inducing target membrane remodeling. viroplasm is generated from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 2B protein regulates autophagy and apoptosis. mitochondrion takes up Ca2+ from the ER, leading to cytochrome cis. the 2B protein regulates apoptosis by altering calcium homeostasis. it also regulates apoptosis through the endogenous pathway. the 2B protein has also been shown to regulate apoptosis through the endogenous pathway. the EV71 2B protein was localized to the mitochondria and induced apoptosis by activating the proapoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2-associated X (BAX) protein without a significant uptake of Ca2+ by the mitochondria. the 2B protein mainly affects the host immune response through inflammasome activation and by direct antagonism of the host immune response. the EMCV, PV, EV71, and HRV 2B proteins all activate the NLRP3 inflammasome but use distinct mechanisms [12,69] the 2B protein can stimulate the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway to activate caspase-1, which catalyzes the proteolysis of pro-IL-1 to IL-1, leading to its secretion from across the plasma membrane by inducing a Ca2+ efflux from intracellular storage. inhibition of protein transport may be related to changes in the Ca2+ concentration. 2B protein antagonizes RIG-I-mediated antiviral responses by inhibiting expression of RIG-I as an FMDV-specific reaction. proteins can affect the host immune response, thereby promoting viral amplification or the release of viral particles. changes in membrane permeability have also been suggested to be regulated by the content of specific membrane phospholipids [11,40]. however, the role of the 2B protein in Ca2+ homeostasis remains unclear. the 2B protein may change the Ca2+

studies on the structure and function of the 2B protein could open up new avenues for the prevention and control of picornaviruses. genetically engineered vaccines are considered more suitable options to overcome these shortcomings of inactivated viral vaccines. the EV VP1 protein is located outside the viral membrane and is thus exposed to the greatest amount of immune stress. however, DNA constructs containing the VP1 gene of EV71 showed low levels of antigenicity. adamantane, amiloride, alkyl iminosugar, and spirane amine are main inhibitors of viroporin activity. spirane amines, such as BL-1743, also inhibit the influenza A virus M2 channel. viroporin inhibitors include 1,3-dibenzyl-5(2H-1,2,3,4-tetraazol-5-yl) hexahydropyrimidine (CD), N-(1-phenylethyl)-2-[4-(phenylsulfonyl)-1-piperazinyl]-4-quinazolinamine (LDS25), and 6-methyl-1,3,8-trihydroxyanth-raquinon Xie et al. [102] found that 4,4\u2032-diisothiocyano-2,2\u2032-stilbenedisulfonic acid blocked a chloride-dependent current, mediated by the EV71 2B protein, and suppressed viral amplification. further research is needed to uncover the underlying mechanism. new technologies such as fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and design of molecular dynamics analogs are expected to greatly contribute to genetically engineered vaccines are considered more suitable options to overcome these shortcomings of inactivated viral vaccines. the EV VP1 protein is located outside the viral membrane and is thus exposed to the greatest amount of immune stress. however, DNA constructs containing the VP1 gene of EV71 showed low levels of antigenicity. adamantane, amiloride, alkyl iminosugar and spirane amine are main types of inhibitors of viroporin activity. adamantane inhibits the M2 channel of influenza A virus by destroying the transmembrane network of hydrogen-bonded water molecules. amiloride is a composite of two drugs, 5-(N,N-hexamethylene) amiloride and a novel inhibitor, BIT225. viroporin inhibitors include spirane amines, BL-1743, hexahydropyrimidine, hexahydropyrimidine, n-(1-phenylethyl)-2-[4-(phenylsulfonyl)-1-piperazinyl]-4-quinazolinamine, and 6-methyl-1,3,8-trihydroxyanth-raquinone (Emodin), among others.
