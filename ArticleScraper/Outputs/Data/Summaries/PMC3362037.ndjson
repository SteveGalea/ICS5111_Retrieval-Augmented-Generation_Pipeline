{"summary": "three pathways can deliver cytoplasmic components into the lumen of the lysosome. they are commonly referred to as autophagy (cell \u201cself-eating\u201d) and include chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), microautophagy, and macroautophagy. the molecular mechanism underlying this pathway remains largely unknown. unique features of the pathway include the double-membrane structure of the autophagosomes. the lysosomes were originally characterized over 50 years ago from detailed electron microscopy studies. new studies have highlighted the intricate vital role that autophagy plays in the physiology of cells and multicellular organisms. autophagy was considered a non-selective pathway induced as a survival mechanism in response to cellular stresses. over the past several years, it has become increasingly evident that autophagy is a highly selective process involved in clearance of excess or dysfunctional organelles, protein aggregates and intracellular pathogens. atg1/ULK complex consists of Atg1, Atg13, and Atg17 in yeast. phosphorylation state of Atg13 modulates its binding to Atg1 and Atg17. phosphorylation state of Atg13 modulates its binding to Atg1 and Atg17. complex I is required for the induction of autophagy and through its fourth component, Vps15, and Atg6. complex II contains Vps38 as the fourth subunit and it is involved in endosomal trafficking and vacuole biogenesis. complex II contains Vps38 as the fourth subunit. class III PI3K complexes contain three common components: hVps34, p150 (Vps15 ortholog), and Beclin 1 (Atg6 ortholog) the counterparts of Atg14 and Vps38 are called Atg14L/Barkor and UVRAG. Atg9 is the only conserved transmembrane protein that is essential for autophagy. it is distributed to the PAS and multiple additional cytoplasmic tubulovesicular compartments derived from the Golgi [35\u201337]. Atg9 is also essential to recruit the PI3K Complex I to the PAS. mAtg9 localizes to the TGN and late endosomes and redistributes to autophagosomal structures upon the induction of autophagy. as in yeast, cycling of mAtg9 between locations also requires the Atg1/ULK complex and kinase activity hVps34 [39, 43] tg16 complex localizes to the phagophore and acts as an E3-like enzyme, determining the site of Atg8/LC3 lipidation. tg16 complex localizes to the phagophore and acts as an E3-like enzyme, determining the site of Atg8/LC3 lipidation. some evidence suggest these two conjugation systems also function together during the expansion and closure of the phagophore. a series of new studies have implicated several cellular organelles as the possible source for the autophagosomal lipid bilayers. the plasma membrane and elements of the trafficking machinery to the cell surface have been linked to the formation of an early autophagosomal intermediate, perhaps the phagophore. the discrepancy between the conclusions of the various studies has not allowed yet drawing a model about the membrane dynamics during autophagosome biogenesis. a third possibility is that the source of phagophore membrane could depend on the nature of the double-membrane vesicle cargo. additional investigations are required to shed light on these issues. the Function of the Atg Proteins Autophagosomes are formed by expansion and sealing of a small cistern known as the phagophore or isolation membrane. once complete, they deliver their cargo into the hydrolytic lumen of lysosomes for degradation. a diverse set of components are involved in the biogenesis of autophagosomes. increased activity of the Atg1/ULK kinase is the primary event that determines the acute induction and upregulation of autophagy. it is important to note that ULK1 is part of a protein family and two other members, ULK2 and ULK3, have been shown play a role in autophagy induction. complex II contains Vps38 as the fourth subunit and it is involved in endosomal trafficking and vacuole biogenesis. atg14L is thought to be present on the ER irrespective of autophagy induction. atg14L is thought to be present on the ER irrespective of autophagy induction. UVRAG-containing class III PI3K complex regulates autophagy, impairs formation of autophagosomal precursor structures, and inhibits autophagy. UVRAG associates with the BAR-domain protein Bif-1, which may regulate mAtg9 trafficking from the trans-Golgi network. atg9 is the only conserved transmembrane protein that is essential for autophagy. it is distributed to the PAS and multiple additional cytoplasmic tubulovesicular compartments derived from the Golgi [35\u201337]. Atg9 is also essential to recruit the PI3K Complex I to the PAS [9] atg8/LC3 is cleaved at its C terminus by the Atg4 protease to generate the cytosolic LC3-I with a C-terminal glycine residue. this lipidated form of LC3 (LC3-II) is then conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in a reaction that requires Atg7 and the E2-like enzyme Atg3. a series of new studies have implicated several cellular organelles as the possible source for the autophagosomal lipid bilayers. it is possible that early endosomal- and/or Golgi-derived membranes are also key factors in the initial steps of autophagy. two electron tomography studies have demonstrated the existence of a physical connection between the ER and the forming autophagosomes. these analyses have revealed that the ER is connected to the outer as well as the inner membrane of the phagophore through points of contact. it has also been proposed that the outer membrane of the mitochondria is the main source of the autophagosomal lipid bilayers. small molecules inhibiting autophagy include wortmannin and 3-methyladenine, which hamper the activity of the PI3K; bafilomycin A and chloroquine, which impair the degradative activity of lysosomes. there are no compounds that exclusively block this pathway without affecting other cellular processes. selective types of autophagy perform a cellular quality control function. they must be able to distinguish their substrates from their functional counterparts. molecular mechanisms underlying cargo selection and regulation are still unknown. eight amino acids long sequence can be written D/E-D/E-D/E-W/F/Y-X-X-L/I/V. the terminal L-site is occupied by a hydrophobic residue, either L, I, or V. not all LIR-containing proteins are autophagy cargo receptors. at this location, Atg11 tethers the Atg proteins essential for the Cvt vesicle formation. p62 and NBR1 bind with ubiquitinated cargos via their ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain. p62 interacts with both autophagy-linked FYVE protein (ALFY), which serves to recruit Atg5 and to bind PI3P. the three vacuolar hydrolases, aminopeptidase 1 (Ape1), aminopeptidase 4 (Ape4) and -mannosidase (Ams1) transpose into the vacuole. Ape1 is synthesized as a cytosolic precursor (prApe1), which multimerizes into the higher order Ape1 oligomer. a series of studies have revealed that Atg11 levels could regulate the rate of selective autophag autophagy receptors p62 and neighbour of BRCA1 gene (NBR1) bind both ubiquitinated protein aggregates through an ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain and to LC3 via their LIR motifs. p62 and neighbour of BRCA1 gene (NBR1) also contain an N-terminal Phox and Bem1p (PB1) domain. p62 has been implicated in autophagic degradation of other ubiquitinated substrates such as intracellular bacteria [105], viral capsid proteins [106], the midbody remnant formed after cytokinesis [107], peroxisomes [108, 109], damaged mitochondria [110, 111], and bacteriocidal precursor proteins [112]. the PB1 domain was recently found to be required for p62 to localize to the autophagosome formation site adjacent to the ER [ the fact that the core Atg machinery is required for both nonselective and selective types of autophagy gives raise to the question of whether these two types of autophagy may compete for the same molecular machinery. phosphorylation of autophagy receptors might be a general mechanism for the regulation of selective autophagy. phosphorylation of the PKA site inhibits recruitment of LC3 into autophagosomes. the role of ubiquitin in autophagy has so far been ascribed as a signal for cargo degradation. the in vivo specificity of p62 and NBR1 toward ubiquitin signals remains to be established under different physiological conditions. the role of ubiquitin-like proteins as SUMO and Nedd in selective autophagy is also unexplored. the role of ubiquitin-like proteins as SUMO and Nedd in autophagy is also unexplored. selective types of autophagy perform a cellular quality control function. pathogens (xenophagy), ribosomes and aggregate-prone proteins are specifically targeted for degradation by autophagy. molecular mechanisms underlying cargo selection and regulation of selective types of autophagy are still unknown. the LC3 recognition sequences (LRS) is an eight amino acids long sequence that can be written D/E-D/E-D/E-W/F/Y-X-X-L/I/V. the terminal L-site is occupied by a hydrophobic residue, either L, I, or V. it should be pointed out that not all LIR-containing proteins are autophagy cargo receptors. autophagy receptor p62/sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1) is synthesized as a cytoplasmic precursor protein with a propeptide and rapidly oligomerizes into dodecamers. at this location, Atg11 tethers the Atg proteins essential for the Cvt vesicle formation and the direct binding of Atg19 to Atg8 permits the transport of the Cvt complex into the vesicle. the Cvt pathway is a biosynthetic process mediating the transport of the three vacuolar hydrolases, aminopeptidase 1 (Ape1), aminopeptidase 4 (Ape4) and -mannosidase (Ams1), and the Ty1 transposome into the vacuole [90, 91]. Ape1 is synthesized as a cytosolic precursor (prApe1), which multimerizes into the higher order Ap studies have revealed that Atg11 is also involved in other types of selective autophagy such as mitophagy and pexophagy. the autophagy receptors involved in different types of selective autophagy are different as Atg32 is required for mitophagy [97, 98], whereas Atg30 is essential for pexophagy [99]. the PB1 domain was recently found to be required for p62 to localize to the autophagosome formation site adjacent to the ER [113] p62 has been implicated in autophagic degradation of other ubiquitinated substrates such as intracellular bacteria [105], viral capsid proteins [106], the midbody remnant formed after cytokinesis [107], peroxisomes [108, 109], damaged mitochondria [110, 111], and bacteriocidal precursor proteins [11 lational modifications like phosphorylation and ubiquitination are involved in the regulation of the activity of proteins involved in autophagy. the fact that the core Atg machinery is required for both nonselective and selective types of autophagy gives raise to the question of whether these two types of autophagy may compete for the same molecular machinery. phosphorylation of the PKA site inhibits recruitment of LC3 into autophagosomes. the role of ubiquitin in autophagy has so far been ascribed as a signal for cargo degradation. the role of ubiquitin in autophagy has so far been ascribed as a signal for cargo degradation. the role of ubiquitin-like proteins as SUMO and Nedd in autophagy is also unexplored. the role of ubiquitin-like proteins as SUMO and Nedd in autophagy is also unexplored. selective autophagy operates constitutively at low levels even under nutrient-rich conditions. these proteins mediate the elimination of ubiquitinated structures. defects in these pathways lead to the disruption of tissue homeostasis. such abnormalities might be involved in tumorigenesis and Paget's disease of bone. lipid droplets are probably degraded by autophagy selectively. impairments in lipophagy are known to cause accumulation of lipid droplets in hepatocytes and reduced production of AgRP in neurons. mice showed age-dependent muscle atrophy [141, 142]. Podocyte-specific deletion of Atg5 caused glomerulosclerosis in aging mice. these animals showed increased susceptibility to proteinuric diseases caused by puromycin aminonucleoside and adriamycin. autophagy p62/SQSTM1 is the best-characterized disease-related autophagy receptor. p62 is a ubiquitously expressed cellular protein conserved among metazoan but not in plants and fungi. p62-positive inclusion bodies have been detected in numerous neurodegenerative diseases. p62 interacts with the Nrf2-binding site on Keap1, a component of the Cullin 3-type ubiquitin ligase for Nrf2, resulting in stabilization of Nrf2 and transcriptional activation of Nrf2 target genes. mutations of the p62 gene cause an impairment in the interaction between p62 and ubiquitinated TRAF6 and/or CYLD, which in turn enhances the activation of the NF-B signaling pathway accumulation of p62, at least partially, contributes to tumor growth because the size of the Atg7/ liver tumors is reduced by the additional deletion of p62 [162], which may cause a dysregulation of NF-B signaling. p62 and NBR1 act as autophagy receptors for ubiquitinated cargos such as protein aggregates, mitochondria, midbody rings, bacteria, ribosomal proteins and virus capsids. ubiquitin conjugates in atg7 deficient liver and brain suppressed by knockout of either p62 or Nrf2. accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in tissues defective in autophagy may be attributed to p62-mediated activation of Nrf2. mitochondria also generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) which cause damage through the oxidation of proteins, lipids and DNA often inducing cell death. reticulocytes by treatment with an uncoupling agent results in restoration of mitophagy [172], emphasizing the importance of Nix/Binp3L for the mitochondrial depolarization. the mitochondrial content is regulated during the development of the T cells as well. the high mitochondrial content in thymocytes is shifted to a low mitochondrial content in mature T cells. ubiquitinated mitochondria are recognized by the autophagosome remains unknown. elimination occurs normally in p62-deficient cells. ubiquitin also serves as a tag during xenophagy. x virus-1 (HSV-1) express an inhibitor (ICP34.5) of Atg6/Beclin1. a mutant HSV-1 strain lacking ICP34.5 becomes degraded by selective autophagy in a p62-dependent manner into lysosomes. this function appears to be selective, suggesting that selective autophagy plays an important role in our immune system. autophagy in the neurons also responds to increased circulating levels of free fatty acids after fasting and then induce autophagy to degrade the lipid droplets [192]. autophagy in the neurons supplies endogenous free fatty acids for energy production and seems to be necessary for gene expression of AgPR. g7 knockout mice showed age-dependent muscle atrophy [141, 142]. Podocyte-specific deletion of Atg5 caused glomerulosclerosis in aging mice. proximal tubule-specific Atg5 knockout mice were susceptible to ischemia-reperfusion injury. autophagy p62/SQSTM1 is the best-characterized disease-related autophagy receptor. p62 is a ubiquitously expressed cellular protein conserved among metazoan but not in plants and fungi. p62-positive inclusion bodies have been detected in numerous neurodegenerative diseases. p62 interacts with the Nrf2-binding site on Keap1, a component of the Cullin 3-type ubiquitin ligase for Nrf2, resulting in stabilization of Nrf2 and transcriptional activation of Nrf2 target genes. mutations of the p62 gene cause an impairment in the interaction between p62 and ubiquitinated TRAF6 and/or CYLD. p62 and NBR1 act as autophagy receptors for ubiquitinated cargos such as protein aggregates, mitochondria, midbody rings, bacteria, ribosomal proteins and virus capsids. p62 and NBR1 act as autophagy receptors for ubiquitinated cargos such as protein aggregates, mitochondria, midbody rings, bacteria, ribosomal proteins and virus capsids. ubiquitin conjugates in the Atg7 deficient liver and brain are completely suppressed by additional knockout of either p62 or Nrf2 [169] accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in tissues defective in autophagy might be attributed to p62-mediated activation of Nrf2. mitochondria also generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), which cause damage through the oxidation of proteins, lipids and DNA often inducing cell death. reticulocytes exhibited severe anaemia and lymphopenia. mutant erythrocytes markedly accumulated degenerated mitochondria. mitochondrial content is regulated during the development of the T cells. mitochondrial content is shifted to a low mitochondrial content in mature T cells. ubiquitinated mitochondria are recognized by the autophagosome. elimination occurs normally in p62-deficient cells [182, 183]. ubiquitin also serves as a tag during xenophagy. three proteins have been proposed to be autophagy receptors linking ubiquitinated bacteria and LC3. a mutant HSV-1 strain lacking ICP34.5 becomes degraded by selective autophagy in a p62-dependent manner into lysosomes. a different antimicrobial function has been assigned to autophagy. this function appears to be selective, suggesting that selective autophagy plays an important role in our immune system. autophagy in the neurons also responds to increased circulating levels of free fatty acids after fasting and then induce autophagy to degrade the lipid droplets. this is a conceivable hypothesis because this process allows the cell to survive stress conditions and the casual elimination of cytoplasmic structure in the same scenario could lead to the lethal depletion of an organelle crucial for cell survival. the selective types of autophagy, and this information will be important to determine if indeed bulk autophagy exists."}
