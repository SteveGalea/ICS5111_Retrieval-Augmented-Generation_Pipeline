{"summary": "the IMDx influenza A/B virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) assay is an FDA-approved molecular assay for influenza A virus, influenza B virus, and combined RSV A/B testing on the Abbott m2000 platform. the assay requires minimal operator manipulation; total nucleic acid extraction and molecular detection are performed on the same platform. Specimens positive for other respiratory virus targets (Luminex RVP classic) were run in parallel for each assay to determine specificity. no cross-reactivity was observed for specimens positive for adenovirus (n = 8), human coronavirus 229E (n = 4), OC43 (n = 5), parainfluenza (PIV 1 (n = 6), PIV2 (n = 5), PIV4 (n = 3), rhino/enterovirus (n two approaches were used to calculate sensitivity and specificity. comparison of IMDx and Luminex RVP classic assay against rRT-PCR. sensitivity, specificities, and 95% confidence intervals were determined. detected was not significantly different between the LDT and the IMDx for overall influenza A virus detection and detection of influenza A virus subtype pdm09 (Fisher's exact test; GraphPad QuickCalcs, 2014) IMDx assay showed equivalent sensitivity and specificity for influenza A virus, influenza B virus, and RSV compared to both LDTs and Aggstds. wide ranges in some 95% confidence interval (CI) values were likely due to small numbers of specimens tested. replacement of our LDT with the IMDx assay to include RSV in the front-line screening assay is estimated to remove approximately one-fifth of specimens from further testing. this represents a significant cost savings to the laboratory."}
