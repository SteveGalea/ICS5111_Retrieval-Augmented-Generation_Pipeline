{"summary": "seasonality of total newly notified pulmonary TB cases from 2004 to 2013 in Wuhan, china. seasonal amplitude was calculated and compared within the subgroups. seasonal amplitude was calculated and compared within the subgroups. spring peak was most likely caused by increased reactivation of latent TB due to vitamin D deficiency and high PM2.5 concentration. summer peak was mainly resulted from enhanced winter transmission due to indoor crowding in winter, overcrowding of public transportation and health care seeking delay in winter. Wuhan city with 10 million residents is the fourth largest city in china. there are only a few studies reporting the seasonal variation of TB in China. the first one was conducted in Hong Kong from 1991 to 2002. the second one was about the whole country from 2004 to 2012. the TRAMO-SEATS program is an advanced seasonal adjustment program paralleled with X-12-ARIMA program. the original time series is decomposed into three basic components: trend component, seasonal factor and irregular noise component. the trend component is the long-term and medium-to-long term variation tendency of the time series. annual spring and summer seasonal amplitude difference was defined as a fraction with the numerator being the spring-peak-to-summer-peak difference between the months with the highest spring or summer and the lowest case counts. the denominator being mean case counts for that year was defined as the fraction with the numerator being the spring-peak-to-summer-peak difference. the TRAMO-SEATS program is an advanced seasonal adjustment program paralleled with X-12-ARIMA program. the original time series is decomposed into three basic components: trend component, seasonal factor and irregular noise component. the trend component is the long-term variation tendency of the time series, including up or down trend and important break points. annual spring-summer amplitude difference was defined as a fraction with the numerator being the spring-peak-to-summer-peak difference between the months with the highest spring or summer and the lowest case counts. the denominator being mean case counts for that year was defined as the fraction with the numerator being the spring-peak-to-summer-peak difference. there were a dominant spring peak (March), summer (June\u2013September), autumn (October\u2013November), and winter (December\u2013February) there were a second summer peak (September), along with the trough (December). there were a dominant spring peak (March) and a second summer peak (September) the original time series of pulmonary TB cases. Figure 2, 3 and 4 showed the three components produced by TRAMO-SEATS program which were trend component, seasonal and irregular noise component. seasonal amplitude decreased each year from 2004 to 2013 from 2004 to 2013. group spring peak/trough month Seasonal amplitude(%) SE(%) 95%CI(%) lower 95%CI(%) upper P value All PTB cases Mar/Dec 56.81 6.29 41.93 71.69 Period Year 2004\u20132008 Mar/Dec 73.17 5.00 59.29 87.05 0.001 Year 2009\u20132013 Mar/Dec 40.45 4.40 28.24 52.66 Sex Male Mar/Dec 58.01 6.18 43.39 72 two-tailed two dependent samples Student's t-test for difference in seasonal amplitudes. an annual mean of 43.40% (95% CI, 28.88%\u201357.92%) more pulmonary TB cases were notified in the summer peak month (September) 93 0.389 Female Sep/Dec 49.83 4.98 38.05 61.61 Age(years) 0\u201314 July/Dec 100.09 14.91 64.83 135.35 0.003 15\u201324 Sep/Dec 73.69 9.38 51.51 95.87 25\u201344 Sep/Dec 36.05 6.09 21.65 50.45 45\u201364 Aug/Dec 44.19 7.65 26.10 62.28 65+ Aug/Dec 44. all PTB cases Mar/Sep 15.53 21.17 9.13 12.03 Period Year 2004\u20132008 Mar/Sep 17.98 24.50 12.97 11.53 Year 2009\u20132013 Mar/Sep 13.08 20.05 7.85 12.19 Sex Male Mar/Sep 17.84 25.21 14.17 11.04 Female Mar/Sep 5.66 12.99 0.17 12.82 Age(years)0\u201314 Apr/July 6.34 35.63 44.32 79.94 15\u201324 in china, pulmonary tuberculosis is one of the legal infectious diseases. a procedure that filters seasonal fluctuations from a time series is called a seasonal adjustment program. TRAMO does the pre-adjustment of the series and stands for \"Time Series Regression with ARIMA Noise, Missing Observations and Outliers\" the summer peak month was September for the total pulmonary TB cases. poor ventilated room crowded with people could increase transmission in winter. crowding and poor ventilated public transport plays an important role in the transmission of pulmonary TB. the weather in winter is moderately cold in Wuhan. the cold weather may be a possible cause leading to health care seeking delay in winter. this delay contributes to diagnosis delay which may increase the risk of disease transmission. reactivation of tuberculosis is associated with HIV infection, immunosuppressive therapy or complex factors such as poor nutrition and socioeconomic status. vitamin D deficiency could impair cell mediated immunity and reduce function of macrophages. several studies showed that after a time of exposure to diesel exhaust inhalation, the expression levels of interleukin (TNF)-, IL-12, interferon (IFN)- in marine decreased significantly [36], [37]. a recent study suggested a potential association between the exposure to particulate matter (PM) and pulmonary TB [39]. in rainy season, the temperature is high and the continuous heavy rain is infrequent. there was no significant difference between the males and females in the spring and summer seasonal amplitude. this observation was similar to many studies on the seasonality of TB over the world. lack of clinical data was a major limitation of this study. there were no data on other clinical characteristics such as culture result, cavity, retreatment or new case. all of the explanation of the seasonality was just the speculation."}
