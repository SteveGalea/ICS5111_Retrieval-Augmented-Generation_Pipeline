{"summary": "the novel pandemic influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 virus was first identified in Mexico in April 2009. it spread worldwide over a short period of time. mutations in specific regions of the viral genome could result in more virulent virus stains, leading to a more severe pathogenicity. influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 emerged and spread rapidly around the world [1,2], causing the world to declare a pandemic in June. one particular amino acid substitution aspartic acid to glycine at position 222 (D222G) (225 in H3 numbering) has appeared sporadically in 20 countries, including Norway, Mexico, Ukraine and the USA [3-5] lutamic acid 374 to lysine acid (E374K) mutation located at the stalk of HA2 in the cavity where the fusion domain of mature HA molecules might have an impact on the antigenicity or neutralization activity of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. samples are also received from community, hospitalised and fatal cases are forwarded to the Tunisia National Influenza Centre for diagnostic and further characterisation. a total of 3836 out of 7350 respiratory specimens with ILI coming from the sentinel physicians network were positive for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (95%) in 2010\u20132011 season, 146 out of 894 of the cases were positive for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (70%). in 2010\u20132011 season, 146 out of 894 cases were positive for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (70%). HA subunit of viral haemagglutinin was found in clinical specimens from 3 out of 42 cases analyzed in Tunisia with severe outcome (7%). this patient died after 3 days, suffering of severe respiratory symptoms of flu. autopsy revealed pulmonary oedema, large mucosis secretions but no cardiac inflammation. a genetic analysis of HA of influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus showed that this virus was a reassortant containing gene segments from ancestor viruses of human, swine and avian sources. polymorphism at position 222 within the haemagglutinin molecule may have remarkable impact on viral host range, replication, and pathogenicity. the frequency of D222G substitution is higher in severe cases than mild cases. 222 G/E polymorphisms in the haemagglutinin gene of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus have been associated with cases of mild to severe illness from different countries or geographical areas. influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 mutants with 222 G/E polymorphisms showed increased clinical virulence. detection of such mutants in the next epidemics is mandatory for better management of ILI in individual patients."}
