{"summary": "new assay methods are available that allow for relatively rapid detection of multiple virus types including influenza. the study used singleplex RT-PCR (SRT-PCR) to detect influenza virus. the study was designed to determine the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine. in toto, 1171 specimens were collected and tested for presence of influenza using SRT-PCR. funding was available to analyze with MRT-PCR all specimens SRT-PCR-positive for influenza and a random sample of specimens SRT-PCR-negative for influenza. the eSensor RVP MRT-PCR assay (GenMark Diagnostics) used in this study is currently approved for clinical use in Europe. for influenza B, kappa = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.91\u20130.99, and Chi-square P 0.001. the sensitivity was 96% and 91% and specificity was 99.8% and 100%, respectively, for influenza A and influenza B. among the SRT-PCR positives but MRT-PCR negatives for influenza A, the Ct values ranged from 21.7 to 39.3. most (8 of 10 where data were available) being above 32.4 (which was 1 sd above the influenza A mean), suggesting that these were weak positives. the multiplex corresponded well with singleplex RT-PCR with high kappa values. sensitivity (96% for influenza A and 91% for influenza B) and specificity (100% for influenza A and 100% for influenza B) were higher in the present study than previously reported. conflict of interests Dr. Zimmerman has research funding from Sanofi Pasteur, Inc., and Pfizer, Inc."}
