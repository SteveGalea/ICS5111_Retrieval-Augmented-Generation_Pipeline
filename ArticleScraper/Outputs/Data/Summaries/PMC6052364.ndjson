{"summary": "the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infects the epithelial cells of the porcine intestine, leading to acute diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration. PEDV possesses genes encoding structural spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins in the 3' one-third of the genome. the IFN- family in humans consists of four members. swine expresses only IFN-1 and IFN-3. the molecular mechanism by which PEDV proliferation is inhibited by IFN- has not yet been determined. PEDV N protein was shown to block IFN- production in HEK-293T cells. only N protein and papain-like protease 2 (PLP2) of PEDV have been demonstrated as IFN antagonists. it remains to be determined whether the N protein of PEDV functions as an IFN- antagonist. the supernatants were then filtered through a 0.22-m-pore filter. the supernatants were then used as inoculum for virus isolation. the inoculum was replaced with DMEM supplemented with antibiotics and trypsin (5 g/ml) 01 was cloned into the pcDNA3.1-flag using ClonExpress II One Step Cloning Kit (Vazyme, China) to produce the pcDNA3-N expression vector. all primers used in this study are listed in Table 1. the purified PCR products were cloned into the pEASYBlunt plasmid. the nucleotide sequences of N genes from ten isolates were submitted to GenBank. cDNA was synthesized using a Reverse Transcription kit (TOYOBO, Japan) qPCR was performed in a 20-l reaction mixture with SYBR qPCR mix. transcriptional level of housekeeping gene -actin was used to normalize that of the target genes. cells at 24 h post transfection were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 \u00b0C overnight, and then washed with 1phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 15 min and blocked with PBS containing 10% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h. samples were labeled with mouse monoclonal anti-PEDV N protein IgG Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE; 10% (0.1 g/ml)) was used to separate proteins, which were then electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) and 5% nonfat milk was used to block the blots before they were probed with primary the IPEC-J2 cell line was kindly provided by Prof. Jie FENG. the PEDV strains were isolated from clinically diseased pigs in china. the supernatants were then filtered through a 0.22-m-pore filter. the 1517-bp promoter region of pGL3-PIFN-3 was predicted by an online prediction server. the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3.1-flag vector was constructed and maintained by our laboratory. the nucleotide sequences of N genes from ten isolates were submitted to GenBank (accession numbers MF118911\u2013MF118920) the nucleotide sequences of N genes from ten isolates were aligned and an amino acid phylogenetic tree was constructed using MEGA6.0 software and the ClustalW method. IPEC-J2 cells were seeded in 24-well plates and co-transfected with 0.5 g poly(I:C) and 1 g pcDNA3-N. cell transfected only with lipofectamine, only with the pcDNA3.1 vector. those without any treatment were taken as lipofectamine control, vector control, and blank control. centrifugation at 13 800g for 5 min and homogenized in 100 l 1passive lysis buffer. cell lysates (20 l) were added to a 96-well fluoroscopy plate. cell nuclei were stained with 4',6-di. Western blotting Cell lysates were prepared in 50 l of radio-immunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) lysis buffer (Beyotime, China) containing 1 mmol phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) protein concentrations were quantified using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Sangon Biotech, China) a phylogenetic tree was constructed based on multiple sequence alignment of 11 sequences. most of the PEDV recent strains share N protein amino acid identities of 98.2% to 100.0%. western blots revealed that the N protein began to be expressed in IPEC-J2 cells at 24 h post transfection. pcDNA3-N immunofluorescence validated this result and showed that the N protein was expressed in the cytoplasm. this suggests that transfected cells could successfully express nucleoprotein. the IFN transcriptional factor IRF3, but not IRF7, showed a similar downward trend. the results indicated that PEDV N protein might inhibit the induction of IFN-3, but not of other IFNs in IPEC-J2 cells. PEDV nucleocapsid protein transfection Cells only transfected with pcDNA3.1 vector were taken as vector control. NF-B, the key cellular transcription factor in the IFN pathway, was examined after PEDV N protein was expressed in poly(I:C)-induced IPEC-J2 cells. phylogenetic tree was constructed based on multiple sequence alignment of 11 sequences. the recent PEDV strains shared N protein amino acid identities of 98.2% to 100.0%. ten strains isolated between 2013 and 2017 from different farms in china. nucleoprotein expression detected after transfection began to express at 24 h post transfection in IPEC-J2 cells. cells only transfected with lipofectamine and those without any treatment were taken as lipofectamine control (Lipo) and blank control (blank), respectively. expression of nucleoprotein in almost all the cells at 24 h post transfection could be detected in the transfected cells cytoplasma (in the white box) nucleoprotein All the three types of IFN expression could be induced after poly(I:C) induction. but only IFN-3 expression was decreased after PEDV nucleoprotein transfection compared with that in pcDNA3.1 vector transfection group. cells only transfected with pcDNA3.1 vector were taken as vector control. NF-B was in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells after induction of poly(I:C) it was translocated into the nuclei, but when PEDV N protein was co-expressed, the NF-B distribution returned to the same as in unstimulated cells. NF-B was not affected by transfection with the backbone vector pcDNA3.1. the majority of PEDV strains recently isolated in china shared the same N amino acid identity. the recently discovered IFN- has been reported to play a critical role in antiviral defense at the mucosal surface. we first increased IFN production in IPEC-J2 cells by adding poly(I:C) the type I IFN inhibitory mechanism of PEDV was extensively investigated in previous studies. however, Ding et al. (2014) found that PEDV N protein significantly inhibited the production of type I IFN in HEK 293 cells. NF-B or IRFs of epithelial cells were activated and then moved into the nuclei and up-regulated the transcription level of IFN-. NF-B failed to move into the nuclei in the PEDV N protein-expressing cells, resulting in a significant decrease in mRNA level of IFN-. reagents and vaccines."}
