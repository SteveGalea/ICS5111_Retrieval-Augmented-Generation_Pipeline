{"summary": "human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a major causative agent of acute respiratory infections especially in young children, older people, and patients with underlying conditions. the virus is a member of the family Pneumoviridae and has a non-segmented negative sense RNA genome containing 8 genes in the order: 3\u2032-N-P-M-F-M2-SH-G-L-5\u2032. the genome encodes 9 viral proteins including three surface glycoprotein HMPV replicates only in a limited number of cell lines. the virus requires trypsin to be cultivated in cell lines. the cytopathic effect (CPE) is often mild and needs to be present for at least 2 weeks to be detected. the original study describing the discovery of HMPV also demonstrated poor infectivity of A549 cells with HMPV. re-evaluated and compared the cell line specificity of recently isolated clinical strains of HMPV. LLC-MK2 derivative cells (ATCC CCL-7.1) were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and antibiotics. all cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. trypsin activates proteolytically the HPMV F protein. pMXs-TRES-Puro retroviral vector was cotransfected with pMXs-IP. three days later, retrovirus vectors in culture supernatants were collected. A549/hSLAM cells stably expressing influenza virus NS1 protein were selected in medium containing 5 g/ml puromycin. clinical samples and clinical isolates of HMPV strains were used. Isolation procedures and clinical isolates of HMPV strains have also been previously reported. reagent for rHMPV-Rluc/GFP was kindly provided by Dr. Bin Gotoh. reagents for rHMPV-Rluc/GFP were kindly provided by Dr. Ron A.M. Fouchier. the amplified DNAs of the F-M2-SH-G region were fragmented and tagged with index adaptors by using NEBNext dsDNA Fragmentase and NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina. prepared libraries were verified with gel electrophoresis and quantified with Quantus Fluorometer (Promega) before loading on the sequencing chip. reads with the same index sequences were grouped together and subjected to de novo assembly Sequencing libraries were prepared from the amplified DNA by using SMRTBell template prep kit 1.0 reagents (Pacific Biosciences) without fragmentation. the libraries were sequenced on a PacBio RSII instrument with the DNA sequencing reagent 4.0 (Pacific Biosciences) and SMRT Cell 8 Pac V3 (Pacific Biosciences) at 72 hpi, cells infected with clinical isolates of HMPV strains were subjected to an indirect immunofluorescent assay with mouse anti-HMPV-F monoclonal antibody (clone 1G3). at 72 hpi, the number of HMPV-infected cells was counted under fluorescent microscopy. s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FCS and antibiotics. LLC-MK2 derivative cells (ATCC CCL-7.1) were grown in a 1:1 mixture of DMEM and Ham\u2019s F-12 medium supplemented with 10% FCS and antibiotics. the coding sequence of influenza virus NS1 protein (PR8 strain) was FLAG-tagged and inserted into a murine leukemia virus-based retroviral vector. three days later, retrovirus vectors in the culture supernatants were collected, and A549/hSLAM cells [37] were infected with the retrovirus vectors. two HMPV strains, IA3-2002 and IA10-2003, were obtained from ZeptoMetrix. the full-length genome cDNA of the hMPV/Sendai/0256/2015 strain was cloned into pBluescript vector (Stratagene) an additional transcription unit for EGFP was created between the N and P genes. GFP-expressing recombinant CAN97-83 strain (rHMPV-GFP) [20] was obtained from Vira Tree. reagent for rHMPV-Rluc/GFP was provided by Dr. Bin Gotoh. the amplified DNAs of the F-M2-SH-G region were fragmented and tagged with index adaptors by using a miSeq v3 600-cycle kit (Illumina) the index libraries were pooled and sequenced using a miSeq v3 600-cycle kit (Illumina) after the sequencing run, reads with the same index sequences were grouped together. halves of synthesized cDNA were amplified separately using PCR with PrimeSTAR GXL DBA Polymerase (TaKaRa Bio) and two pairs of viral gene specific primers, HMPV_full2_A_F1 and GNR2_mod2. libraries were sequenced on a PacBio RSII instrument with the DNA sequencing reagent 4.0 (Pacific Biosciences) recombinant HMPV strains were incubated with serially diluted virus stocks in DMEM supplemented with 5% FCS and antibiotics at 33\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. no trypsin was added to the culture media to prevent the second round of infection. at 48 hours post-infection, the number of cells infected with clinical isolates of HMPV strains was counted under fluorescent microscopy. a phylogenetic analysis was performed using the G gene sequences of the 41 HMPV strains and previously reported HMPV strains. the data showed that all the A2b180nt-dup and A2b111nt-dup strains previously detected in Yokohama city, japan, and Barcelona city, Spain. a phylogenetic analysis was performed to obtain the highest resolution of phylogenetic relationships of subtype A2b strains. the full-length genome sequence of hMPV/Sendai/0256/2015 was successfully determined directly from the clinical specimens. tree was constructed using the G gene sequences of 41 A2b HMPV strains detected in Sendai and 97 strains obtained from the NCBI nucleotide sequence database. tree was rooted with A2a HMPV strain HMPV/Yokohama.JPN/P7877/2015 and tested with bootstrapping (100 replicates). a phylogenetic tree was constructed using the full genome sequences of 9 HMPV strains isolated in Sendai. the tree was tested with bootstrapping (100 replicates) genome sequence of hMPV/Sendai/0256/2015 was determined directly from the clinical specimen. the sequence would reflect the original virus sequence in the patient. data showed no nucleotide change in the virus genome during the isolation and passages in MNT-1 and veroE6/TMPRSS2 cells. TMPRSS2, Vero-ATCC, and LLC-MK2 cells were isolated and subjected to full-length genome sequencing. the nucleotide sequence of this region was successfully determined directly from the clinical specimens of the 4 patients. 2 out of the 4 strains acquired no amino acid changes in all 3 surface glycoproteins (F, SH, and G) and the M2 protein during the isolation and passages in cell lines. the first nucleotide of the initiation codon of each gene and the first methionine of each protein are deemed nucleotide position 1 and amino acid position 1 respectively. the first nucleotide of the initiation codon of each gene and the first methionine of each protein are shown. the hMPV/Sendai/0256/2015 strain was isolated using MNT-1 and VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells. the recombinant MG0256-EGFP strain was generated based on the sequence of the hMPV/Sendai/0256/2015 strain. the infectivity titers of all clinical strains were the greatest when determined using veroE6 or LLC-MK cells. the infectivity titer of each strain in each clinical strain was set to 100% for comparison. o, HeLa, MNT-1, HEK293, BEAS-2B, and A549) with thirteen clinical HMPV strains was analyzed. relative infectivity is presented as the average and standard errors from triplicated experiments. CAN97-83GFP was purchased from ViraTree and propagated in veroE6/TMPRSS2 cells. the subtypes of the parental strains of six recombinant strains were greatest. the infectivity titer of each HMPVGFP strain in veroE6 cells was set to 100% for comparison. a lack of the type I interferon gene [49] is a possible reason for why HMPV showed the highest infectivity titers in veroE6 cells. a lack of the type I interferon gene [49] is a possible reason for why HMPV showed the highest infectivity titers. infectivity of various cell lines with recombinant HMPVGFP strains was set to 100%. the numbers of HMPV infected cells in veroE6 cells were set to 100%. copies are presented as the average and standard errors from triplicated experiments. the numbers of HMPV-infected cells in veroE6 cells were set to 100%. a phylogenetic analysis was performed using the G gene sequences of the 41 HMPV strains. the 20 A2b180nt-dup strains detected in Sendai were located in a cluster together with 3 A2b111nt-dup and 24 A2b180nt-dup strains previously detected in Yokohama city, japan, and Barcelona city, Spain. six HMPV A2b strains without nt-dup duplication in the G gene were also observed in this cluster. cluster formed together with a HMPV A2b strain isolated in 2016 in Albuquerque, new Mexico, USA. these data indicate that the A2b180nt-dup strains isolated in Sendai between 2014 and 2016 were closely related to the HMPV strain isolated in Albuquerque. however, the Albuquerque strain (HMPV/USA/NM009/2016) does not have 180nt-dup. phylogenetic tree of HMPV full genome sequence was constructed using the. full genome sequences of 9 strains isolated in Sendai and 140 strains obtained from the NCBI nucleotide sequence database. the tree was tested with bootstrapping (100 replicates) the tree was tested with bootstrapping (100 replicates) each one of nonsynonymous and synonymous mutations was found in the G and M2 genes, respectively, after the passages in veroE6 cells. one nonsynonymous mutation was found in the F gene after the passages in MNT-1, veroE6/TMPRSS2, and LLC-MK2 cells. this data demonstrated that virus selection does not necessarily occur during the isolation and passages in these cell lines. patient # Virus Strain Nucleotide and amino acid substitutions in each viral gene and protein* F M2 SH G 1 hMPV/Sendai/0256/2015 none none none none none 2 hMPV/Sendai/0587/2014 none none none TT92,93CC (L31P) T32C (I11T) T102C (-) T54C (-) T269C (I90T) T82C (F28L the first nucleotide of the initiation codon of each gene and the first methionine of each protein are deemed nucleotide position 1 and amino acid position 1 respectively. the recombinant MG0256-EGFP strain was generated based on the sequence of the hMPV/Sendai/0256/2015 strain. the infectivity titers of all clinical strains were the greatest when determined using veroE6 or LLC-MK cells. the infectivity titers of all clinical strains were the greatest when determined using veroE6 or LLC-MK cells. infectivity of various cell lines with clinical isolates of HMPV was analyzed. the numbers of HMPV infected cells in veroE6 cells were set to 100%. relative infectivity is presented as the average and standard errors from triplicated experiments. parental strain of MG0256-EGFP (MG0256EGFP) was isolated and propagated in MNT-1 and VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells. CAN97-83GFP was purchased from ViraTree and propagated in veroE6/TMPRSS2 cells. all six recombinant strains showed reasonably high titers in LLC-MK2 cells. the infectivity titer of other four HMPVGFP strains was intermediate between those of JPS02-76GFP and NL/1/00GFP. a lack of the type I interferon gene is a possible reason for why HMPV showed the highest infectivity titers in veroE6 cells. strain Recombinant strain Name Isolation cell Propagation cell Reference NL/1/00 tMK tMK 2001 A1 [4] NL/1/00-gfp BHK/T7-9 VET [23] CAN97-83 L, V 2003 A2a [26] MPV-GFP1 BSR T7/5 L, VET [20] JPN03-1 L L 2003 A2a [48] rHMPV-Rluc/GFP BHK at 6 hpi, total RNAs were extracted from VSV-infected or mock-infected cells. levels of mRNA of IFN-, MX1 and OASL were determined by qPCR. the values were normalized to levels of the control gene HPRT1. LLC-MK2 cells retain a functional IFN system and produce IFN in response to virus infections and exhibit an antiviral state. the quality or condition of the IFN system is not the main factor that determines the infectivity of each cell line with HMPV. no significant difference has been observed in clinical presentations among HMPV strains. the variations may be produced by mutations during isolation and passages of HMPV strains in specific cell lines. this study demonstrated that no amino acid change was required in the surface glycoproteins or even in the entire genome of HMPV to propagate in specific cell lines. previous studies have only detected the virus genomes in clinical samples by RT-PCR. the full-genome sequence analysis of A2b180nt-dup strains showed that 180nt-dup was maintained in the virus genome during the process of virus isolation and passages in cell lines. oE6 and LLC-MK2 cells show the highest infectivity with clinical isolates and commonly used recombinant HMPV strains. the consensus is that veroE6 and LLC-MK2 cells have the highest infectivity for all the HMPV strains. however, the infectivity of other cell lines with HMPV is significantly lower than that of veroE6 and LLC-MK2 cells and varies significantly among HMPV strains. nucleotide and amino acid changes of MG025-EGFP strain during passages in each cell line."}
