{"summary": "Bocavirus is a single-stranded DNA virus belonging to the family Parvoviridae, subfamily Parvovirinae, genus Bocavirus. it contains a third ORF between the non-structural and structural coding regions. the genus bocavirus includes viruses that infect bovine, canine, feline, porcine and some simian species as well as sea lions. asopharyngeal aspirates and swabs and relies mostly on classical [10], [18], [21], [22], [26] and real-time PCR [23], [29]. current study aims to screen epidemiological status and molecular phylogeny of HBoV isolates prevailing in pediatric patients with respiratory infection in Saudi Arabia. 7 yr 4 0 >7\u201310 yr 4 1 Sex Male 39 8 Female 41 10 Clinical symptoms Fever 80 18 Nasal discharge 80 18 Watery 70 16 Purulent 10 2 LRTIa 41 15 URTIb 39 3 Diarrhea 20 3 Nervous manifestations 2 0 Rash 6 0 a Lower respiratory tract infection. b Upper respiratory tract infection. Table 2. Common respiratory viruses among HBoV infected children. in previous studies, none of the nasal swabs obtained from healthy children yielded a positive HBoV test. this suggests that HBoV is not a frequent commensal virus inhabiting the respiratory tract. in the current study, only one case was found to be infected only by HBoV as a single virus entity. most of isolates (17/18) showed coinfection with other viral pathogens. phylogenetic tree with 1,000 bootstrap replicates was generated using the Clustal W program in the MEGA 4.0 software package. samples obtained in the current study from children with acute respiratory distress in Saudi Arabia are in red. real-time PCR assay was performed using commercial, TaqMan hydrolysis probe based, real time PCR bocavirus detection kit. amplification reactions were performed in a volume of 25 l containing 2.5 l of DNA template, 21.5 l reaction mix, 0.4 l enzyme mix, 1 l internal control according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. nucleotide sequences of the NS1 gene were compared with those of HBoV strains available at the GenBank site. the 3/18 partial sequences of the NS1 gene were submitted to GenBank. HBoV positive samples were screened for presence of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A virus (IAV), parinfluenza virus 1(PIV-1) and parainfluenza virus 3(PIV-3) the reaction mix contained 20 pmol of each primer and DNA master mix. 2978)."}
