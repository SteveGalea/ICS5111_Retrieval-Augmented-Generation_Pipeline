{"summary": "despite advances in diagnostic technologies, many patients receive empiric antimicrobial therapy rather than appropriate therapy dictated by the rapid identification of the infectious agent. the result is overuse of our small inventory of effective antimicrobials, whose numbers continue to dwindle due to increasing levels of antimicrobial resistance. new tests are needed that can identify a specific pathogen or at a minimum distinguish between bacterial and viral infections. federal funding agencies should prioritize diagnostics R&D through innovative funding mechanisms and clinical research infrastructure. NIH should ensure that the peer review process for diagnostics grant submissions includes study sections with appropriate expertise to evaluate feasibility and clinical applicability. congress should support increased appropriations for diagnostics activities. the 21st Century Global Health Technology Act (H.R. 1515) will strengthen health R&D programs at the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and require no new funding. federal incentives to stimulate diagnostics R&D should focus on tests with characteristics: Performed directly from accessible, minimally invasive clinical specimens, such as blood, respiratory samples, urine, and stool. Congress should fund information technology solutions for data integration and dissemination. healthcare systems should use clinical guidelines from IDSA and other professional societies to guide patient management decisions regarding the use of diagnostics. the FDA Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) should revise the guidance for research use only/investigational use only (RUO/IUO) devices and permit use in cases where there are no other diagnostic options. the FDA should exempt companies from redemonstrating the clinical validity of a novel diagnostic product. Congress and the health resources and services administration should work with professional societies to support the recruitment and retention of clinical microbiologists and medical technologists. Educate healthcare providers on the Use of Diagnostics AHRQ and HRSA should fund and encourage healthcare institutions and professional societies to strengthen educational programs that disseminate the results of diagnostics-focused health sciences research. the SBIR diagnostics program at the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases (NIAID) and the Point-of-Care Technologies Research Network at the national Institute of biomedical imaging and bioengineering. the center for disease control and prevention (CDC) for the advanced development of innovative infectious diseases diagnostics should enact. federal incentives to stimulate diagnostics R&D should focus on tests with characteristics: Performed directly from accessible, minimally invasive clinical specimens, such as blood, respiratory samples Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) should encourage healthcare systems to improve electronic medical record systems, including electronic reporting of laboratory results to health departments. healthcare systems should use clinical guidelines from IDSA and other professional societies to guide patient management decisions regarding diagnostics use. nhs should withdraw draft proposal to institute a new informed consent requirement for research with de-identified residual clinical samples. Congress should provide incentives and support for institutions to save de-identified specimens when possible for the purposes of new test development, FDA clinical evaluations, and assay verification and validation. Congress should enact the Diagnostic Innovation Testing and Knowledge Advancement Act of 2013 (H.R. 2085 in the 113th Congress) the 113th Congress should enact the Diagnostic Innovation Testing and Knowledge Advancement Act of 2013 (H.R. 2085 in the 113th Congress) diagnostics are not being integrated into clinical care optimally. integration is influenced by the clinical syndrome, the availability of appropriate diagnostics, the place of service, and the experience and knowledge of the healthcare provider. the goal of infectious diseases diagnostics has been to detect the source of the infection and enable an appropriate response. monoclonal antibodies, tagged with fluorescein, enable microbiologists to visualize organisms such as Legionella pneumophila that do not stain well with conventional stains. a major disadvantage of culture-based methods is the time needed for culture growth. antibody detection by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays is enhanced by the use of analytic detectors. the specificity of antigen detection is increased by the use of monoclonal antibodies and recombinant antigens. modern antibody panels can detect multiple antigens and/or antibodies within hours of specimen submission. microscopy, with or without staining, permits the diagnosis of many infectious diseases, for example, acute gonococcal urethritis, primary syphilis, differentiation of gram-positive or gram-negative pathogens on sputum smears. monoclonal antibodies, tagged with fluorescein, enable microbiologists to visualize organisms such as Legionella pneumophila that do not stain well with conventional stains. antibody detection by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays is enhanced by the use of analytic detectors, such as the spectrophotometer, fluorometer, luminometer, and radioactive counter. the specificity of antigen detection is increased by the use of monoclonal antibodies and recombinant antigens. hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and BK virus revolutionized the development of antiretroviral drugs. diagnostics clarify the etiology of the patient's illness, influence treatment modalities, and enable public health surveillance. current antigen and nucleic acid detection tests meet some, but not all of these idealized criteria. diagnostics are to identify disease and enable management of the individual patient. the number of commercially available tests and their uses continues to increase logarithmically. class I and II analytes are considered to have a low (I) or moderate (II) risk of harm and require a 510(k) submission to be sent to the FDA for premarket clearance. nucleic acid amplification methods for viral targets are on the whole faster, more sensitive, and more cost-effective than traditional culture methods. ganciclovir-resistant CMV mutations can be rapidly identified using nucleic acid amplification coupled with sequencing. research assays can detect nucleic acid of viruses heretofore unrecognized and/or not cultivatable in vitro. viral load determines the risk of perinatal and sexual transmission. quantitative assays have had a particularly significant impact on the discovery of previously unrecognized or uncultivable pathogens. pyrosequencing is used to classify mycobacteria and nocardia into clinically important groups. pyrosequencing is used to classify mycobacteria and nocardia into clinically important groups and to identify yeast and filamentous fungi. rifampin resistance in M. tuberculosis is used as a marker for multidrug resistance. a new generation of antimicrobial and antiviral agents highlights the need for diagnostic tests to identify the subpopulations of patients who will benefit from therapy. tests are classified as \u201cmoderately complex\u201d or \u201cwaived\u201d under CLIA regulations. simple, low-risk tests can be performed in physicians\u2019 offices and other locations without routine regulatory oversight. results are available within 1\u20132 hours and hence can inform critical patient management decisions. in the last 2 years, the FDA has cleared (through the 510[k] pathway) or approved (through the premarket approval pathway) numerous molecular diagnostic tests. the number of commercially available tests and their uses continues to increase logarithmically. class III analytes are considered to have a high or unknown risk. 510(k) submission must be sent to the FDA for premarket clearance. nucleic acid amplification methods for viral targets are on the whole faster, more sensitive, and more cost-effective than traditional culture methods. the risk of progression to AIDS and ultimately death is directly related to the magnitude of the HIV-1 RNA level in plasma. viral load determines the risk of perinatal and sexual transmission. genotyping by molecular methods also has prognostic value. pyrosequencing or ultradeep sequencing enables the detection of multiple strains of HIV-1 within a single individual and identification of minority mutants in the quasispecies. pyrosequencing is used to classify mycobacteria and nocardia into clinically important groups. pyrosequencing is used to classify mycobacteria and nocardia into clinically important groups. thicillin resistance genes in Staphylococcus aureus isolates can be achieved with new assays. a new generation of antimicrobial and antiviral agents highlights the need for diagnostic tests to identify the subpopulations of patients who will benefit from therapy. complex tests can be performed by laboratory assistants or other healthcare personnel (such as nurses or clinical personnel) results are available within 1\u20132 hours and therefore can inform critical patient management decisions. for example, whether to initiate antiviral therapy for influenza, begin therapy for tuberculosis, or initiate antibiotic prophylaxis for pregnant women for carriage of group B streptococci. are healthcare providers inadequately informed about the availability and utility of many tests. outpatients are most often not seriously ill, but may have an infection that would benefit from antimicrobial therapy. some studies document that 50% or more of adult and pediatric outpatients who present with acute upper respiratory tract infections receive antibiotics [1\u20133]. the cost of fully automated molecular platforms will decrease as a result of manufacturing advances and free market competition. ED physicians are often managing patients who are sicker, and with whom they do not have an ongoing relationship or means for follow-up. the diagnosis and management of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) illustrates the need for rapid results and tests with high prognostic value. current panels detect only atypical bacteria and not typical bacterial pathogens. procalcitonin (PCT) is a promising biomarker that can be used in addition to fever, leukocytosis, and clinical syndrome as a predictor of bacterial infection. many EDs are associated with inpatient facilities. current infectious diseases diagnostics fall short. meningoencephalitis can be challenging because the differential diagnosis is often extensive and includes infectious, postinfectious, and noninfectious causes. acute organ dysfunction secondary to infection is a medical emergency with increasing incidence. approximately 20%\u201330% of patients with severe sepsis receive inadequate empiric antimicrobial therapy. indiscriminate use of multiple antibiotics may have detrimental effects, such as adverse events, C. difficile infection, and a rise in antimicrobial resistance. indiscriminate use of multiple antibiotics may have detrimental effects. multiplex PCR panels are available to identify a small number of microorganisms in positive blood culture bottles within a few hours. pathogen-specific tests are needed to guide antimicrobial management in septic patients. clinical significance of specimens positive only by PCR remains difficult to interpret. hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia are common healthcare-associated infections that manifest high morbidity and mortality. the frequency of specific multidrug-resistant pathogens is likely to vary across institutions and different patient populations. there are currently no commercially available pathogen-specific assays for HAP or VAP. future assay development should include simultaneous assessment of key drug resistance genes. rapid identification of antibiotic resistance is central to timely isolation of patients harboring drug-resistant organisms. PCR-based detection indicates active infection and transmissibility, when postexposure prophylaxis is necessary, and which pathogen is primary in a dual detection is important both clinically and for cohorting purposes. recent outbreaks have highlighted the need for a solution. net enables the detection of foodborne outbreaks through the characterization of DNA fingerprints using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Isolates with indistinguishable DNA patterns can be identified, thus linking patients and ultimately the source of the infection. development of alternative surveillance strategies is a crucial long-term goal. current regulations allow for development and deployment of diagnostic assays. use of the EUA had its first real test during the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic (A[H1N1]pdm09) the CDC developed a PCR assay and the FDA cleared its use under the EUA. a novel rapid test for diagnosis of drug-resistant tuberculosis, rapid antigen testing for malaria, and a novel rapid test for early diagnosis of leprosy are examples of emerging technologies with applications in the developing world. the development of technology suitable for diagnostic assays for resource-limited countries, as in case of tuberculosis or malaria, may create opportunities for novel applications in countries with more abundant resources. different amplification-based strategies have been evaluated for the diagnosis of invasive Candida and Aspergillus infections in high-risk hematology patients with varying results. recent meta-analyses highlight the lack of assay standardization combined with inconsistent testing algorithms as sources of heterogeneity across studies. new options for the diagnosis of emerging fungal diseases in addition to Candida and Aspergillus are urgently needed, and test development should be paired with robust laboratory standardization efforts. a term newborn has approximately 300 mL of total blood volume and premature infants can have significantly less. testing validated for less invasive clinical samples is also desired. pediatrics is almost always a smaller diagnostic market than that for adult testing. overuse of antibiotics is a significant problem among outpatients. some studies document that 50% or more of adult and pediatric outpatients who present with acute upper respiratory tract infections receive antibiotics [1\u20133] despite the fact that the majority of these illnesses are caused by viruses. molecular platforms will decrease as a result of manufacturing advances and free market competition. ED physicians are often managing patients who are sicker, and with whom they do not have an ongoing relationship or means for follow-up. diagnosis and management of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) illustrates the need for rapid results and tests with high prognostic value. current panels detect only atypical bacteria and not typical bacterial pathogens. the challenge with these typical bacteria is the need to determine if the identified pathogen is colonizing or invading. procalcitonin is a promising biomarker that can be used in addition to fever, leukocytosis, and clinical syndrome as a predictor of bacterial infection. more sensitive molecular-based assays for the detection of viral pathogens directly in CSF have been developed. but currently the only FDA-cleared tests are for enteroviruses. timely access to enterovirus reverse transcription PCR results facilitate shorter hospital stays, reduces antibiotic use, and lessens ancillary laboratory testing. indiscriminate use of multiple antibiotics may have detrimental effects, such as adverse events, C. difficile infection, and a rise in antimicrobial resistance. indiscriminate use of multiple antibiotics may have detrimental effects, such as adverse events, C. difficile infection, and a rise in antimicrobial resistance. multiplex PCR panels are available to identify a small number of microorganisms in positive blood culture bottles within a few hours. pathogen-specific tests are linked to a rapid assessment of drug resistance determinants. hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) are common healthcare-associated infections that manifest high morbidity and mortality. the frequency of specific multidrug-resistant pathogens is likely to vary across institutions and different patient populations. there are currently no commercially available pathogen-specific assays for HAP or VAP, although off-label studies have shown some success for detection of S. aureus infections. future assay development should include simultaneous assessment of key drug resistance genes. novel approaches, such as detection of specific virulence determinants, are needed. sepsis Acute organ dysfunction secondary to infection is a medical emergency with increasing incidence. indiscriminate use of multiple antibiotics may have detrimental effects, such as adverse events, C. difficile infection, and a rise in antimicrobial resistance. a highly sensitive test would be required to confidently withhold broad-spectrum antibiotics from a critically ill patient with systemic signs of infection. pathogen-specific tests are needed to guide antimicrobial management in septic patients. multicenter clinical trials are necessary to define the diagnostic accuracy of molecular assays performed on blood. well-designed multiplex PCRs appear to have value as sepsis diagnostics when used in conjunction with conventional culture and routine antibiotic susceptibility testing. timely reporting of key drug resistance determinants, such as the mecA gene associated with S. aureus methicillin resistance, is essential for optimum impact on antimicrobial selection and infection control practices. quantitative cultures of lower respiratory tract specimens have been advocated to improve diagnostic specificity. however, quantitation did not improve outcomes for intubated patients. there are currently no commercially available pathogen-specific assays for HAP or VAP. tests to identify organisms that produce extended-spectrum -lactamases and carbapenemases are recently available or on the horizon. the increased sensitivity of PCR and the introduction of large pathogen panels have significantly increased the number of hospitalized patients in respiratory isolation. testing to support surveillance activities may occur in clinical laboratories. tests must provide sufficient information to distinguish between strains or serotypes. but currently they rely on cultured organisms to support such characterization. the development of stand-alone assays in routine use for more common infectious diseases is likely to be pursued. current regulations allow for development and deployment of diagnostic assays in the case of a public health emergency through an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) the CDC developed a PCR assay and the FDA cleared its use under the EUA. resource-constrained settings present unique challenges relative to traditional secondary and tertiary care settings. sensitivity and specificity are considerations regardless of setting. differences in prevalence of disease and the potential for a larger differential diagnosis may render predictive values less clinically useful in particular applications. diagnostic uncertainty unnecessarily delays initiation of appropriate antifungal therapy, which is linked to poor outcomes for a variety of invasive fungal infections. new options for the diagnosis of a variety of emerging fungal diseases in addition to Candida and Aspergillus are urgently needed. pediatrics is almost always a smaller diagnostic market than that for adult testing and there is often little incentive for test validation in children. invasive testing may not be effective in the face of neutropenia or immunosuppressive therapy. different amplification-based strategies have been evaluated for the diagnosis of invasive Candida and Aspergillus infections in high-risk hematology patients with varying results. new options for the diagnosis of a variety of emerging fungal diseases in addition to Candida and Aspergillus are urgently needed, and test development should be paired with robust laboratory standardization efforts. a term newborn has approximately 300 mL of total blood volume. premature infants can have significantly less. testing validated for less invasive clinical samples is also desired. the advances will continue to accelerate in the near future. these technologies rely on a variety of established and novel applications to detect nucleic acids and/or proteins, from the pathogen and/or the host. these technologies rely on a variety of established and novel applications to detect nucleic acids and/or proteins, from the pathogen and/or the host. single-step molecular cartridge-based tests Influenza, tuberculosis, malaria Handheld devices for molecular testing, single-step molecular cartridge-based tests Syndromic testing Sepsis, pneumonia (HAP, VAP, CAP), meningitis, diarrheal diseases Highly multiplexed single-step molecular cartridge-based tests. rapid antigen tests are only available for select pathogens. results depend on the analyte, sensitivity of the test, type of sample collected, age of the patient, and time of testing after onset of clinical symptoms. multiplex amplification platforms can be located in central/referral clinical laboratories, rapid response laboratories, and CLIA-certified mini-laboratories. the majority of older molecular diagnostic assays were developed as single-analyte tests. this trend is the result of sophisticated technologies that enable the detection of >1 analyte at a time. enteric disease panels target common bacterial pathogens such as salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, Vibrio, and Campylobacter species. the selection of assay analytes must be clinically relevant; more analytes is not always better. multiplex amplification platforms will replace some activities (viral culture) but will supplement other testing (antibiotic in vitro susceptibility testing) nucleic acid amplification technologies have evolved from traditional and real-time PCR to newer methods such as loop-mediated amplification (LAMP), transcription-mediated amplification, nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA), and strand displacement amplification (SDA). traditional labor intensive nucleic acid isolation and purification methods are now replaced by automated platforms or incorporated directly into 1-step cartridge-based devices. the ESI-TOF interrogates the amplicon weight to determine the base compositions of complementary DNA strands. a small number of possible base compositions are consistent with each measured mass. this technology has been used to identify viral respiratory and biothreat pathogens, including novel variants of influenza. sequencing can provide a genus identification for generally >90% of the strains. some isolates are either misidentified due to high sequence similarities to other pathogens. others are either misidentified due to high sequence similarities to other pathogens. the development and implementation of standardized methods will be critical to the success of NGS as a public health tool for outbreak detection and response and surveillance. new platforms can be used routinely in clinical microbiology laboratories for the rapid identification of bacteria, fungi, mycobacteria, and parasites. the time to first result is approximately 10\u201320 minutes and each subsequent result is available within 1 minute. the MALDI-TOF MS systems have the essential characteristics for success: rapid and accurate results, minimal technical time, and simple sample preparation. resistance detection applications of MALDI-TOF MS are in the early stages of development. the ultimate goal is to couple rapid susceptibility testing with MALDI-TOF MS identification within 24\u201336 hours of receipt in the laboratory. biosensors A biosensor is an analytical device comprised of 2 elements in physical proximity. the physical transducer can be optical, electrochemical, thermometric, piezoelectric, magnetic, or micromechanical. this interaction generates a signal that is amplified and proportional to the concentration of the target analytes. successful POC biosensor diagnostic devices will need to combine miniaturization using, for example, microfluidics. sensitivity and timeliness of culture results are influenced by many factors, especially for hospitalized patients with previously administered and/or concurrent antimicrobial treatment. nucleic acids detected may be from nonviable organisms or from commensal (nonpathogenic) viruses or viruses that are noncontributory to the disease. an incorrect diagnosis based on the presence of nucleic acids could obscure the determination of the real pathogen. mecA gene nucleic acids are detected in a febrile patient with appropriate risk factors. a diagnosis of MRSA bacteremia is not so straightforward when CMV viremia is detected in a patient with fever in the ICU. the detection of antibiotic resistance genes directly from clinical samples is challenging, as mere presence may not always correlate with gene expression and clinical resistance to therapy. how genotypic data relate to phenotypic data may also be unknown. complex tests may require complex data analysis, and algorithms for analysis are incomplete. the majority of testing for infectious diseases is laboratory based. single-step, cartridge-based molecular test devices target pathogens. these assays can be performed on-demand, require minimal hands-on time. some systems only allow 1 test to be performed at a time, often requiring multiple expensive separate platforms or additional modules. multiplexed cartridge-based systems can detect the majority of bacterial pathogens that cause community, ventilator-associated pneumonia within 1\u20132 hours. these systems can detect >20 antibiotic resistance genetic markers. the intent is not to replace culture, as additional characterization of isolates still needs to be performed on cultured samples. the addition of new primers and probes to detect an additional target will require validation of the newly added target. the results depend on the analyte, sensitivity of the test, type of sample collected, age of the patient, and time of testing after onset of clinical symptoms. single-step, cartridge-based molecular test devices target pathogens. these assays can be performed on-demand, require minimal hands-on time. some systems only allow 1 test to be performed at a time, often requiring multiple expensive separate platforms or additional modules. multiplexed cartridge-based systems can detect the majority of bacterial pathogens that cause community, ventilator-associated, and hospital-acquired pneumonia within 1\u20132 hours. these systems can detect >20 antibiotic resistance genetic markers. the intent is not to replace culture, as additional characterization of isolates still needs to be performed on cultured samples. new primers and probes to detect an additional target will require validation of the newly added target and demonstration that the performance for existing targets is not affected. the experimental evidence required demonstrating performance is limited to key points that can be addressed through in-house studies. FDA encourage assay developers to archive specimens used during the clinical evaluation for future use. nucleic acids isolated from clinical samples are amplified with broad-range primers targeting highly conserved genomic regions. the nucleic acid strands move through the electrospray phase and are pulsed under high vacuum. each time an amplicon is detected, the mass spectrum increases. future systems need enhanced sensitivity so as to allow direct detection of pathogens from clinical samples. sequencing can establish a microbial etiology in cases where no pathogen was identified by traditional cultures or due to previous antimicrobial therapy. identifying procedures such as biochemical testing and sequencing could detect virulence determinants and the genetic markers of antimicrobial resistance. this will require companies to perform extensive phenotypic/genotypic comparisons and may in addition require gene expression analysis for detecting complex phenotypes. this will require extensive phenotypic/genotypic comparisons. nucleic acid detection methods rely on fluorometric probes. turbidity, chemiluminescence, or solid-based or liquid bead-based microarrays. nucleic acids are detected directly using sensitive signal amplification. pathogen detection is dependent on accuracy of the ESI-TOF database. current platforms are too large and costly to be practical in a clinical laboratory. new instruments will be significantly reduced in size, cost, and complexity. compact NGS systems have been developed with a small footprint and fast turnaround time. sequencing could replace complex microbiological identification procedures such as biochemical testing. sequencing could detect virulence determinants and the genetic markers of antimicrobial resistance. tof MS platforms can be used routinely in clinical microbiology laboratories. they can be used for the rapid identification of bacteria, fungi, mycobacteria, and parasites. the initial cost for the MALDI-TOF MS is 10\u201320 minutes. reagent cost per id ($.10\u2013$.50) plus savings in technical time (about 1 minute per id) and clinical benefit of providing an organism identification in about 20 minutes. peptide nucleic acid fluorescence in situ hybridization and NAAT systems can provide identification of an organism within 24\u201348 hours. resonance has demonstrated that Candida species can be detected directly from as little as 1 mL of whole blood with a sensitivity ranging from 1 to 3 colony-forming units/mL. this technology may overcome the major limitation of the current detection assays that can only be performed once a blood culture bottle is flagged as positive, thereby reducing detection time from days to hours. biosensors A biosensor is an analytical device comprised of 2 elements in physical proximity. direct biosensor quantification of bacterial 16S RNA was developed to monitor bacterial growth for antibiotic susceptibility testing. low-cost power requirements, compatibility with different matrices, ease of use, and interpretation are essential for clinical applications. ideally, biosensors would be able to detect the target of interest without an amplification step. the inoculated well is covered with a chemical matrix, generally -cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, dried, and the target plate is loaded into the instrument. in the ionization chamber, positively charged molecules are accelerated through an electric field and then enter the time-of-flight mass analyzer. smaller particles travel faster through the tube to the particle detector. peptide nucleic acid fluorescence in situ hybridization and NAAT systems can provide identification of an organism and some susceptibility data within hours. however, these tests are currently limited by the number of pathogens detected, cost per test (on average $25\u2013$75) and technical time required to perform the testing. the biological recognition element may be naturally occurring (eg, microorganism, enzyme, antibody, antigen, nucleic acid sequence, cell receptor), or a biomimic. the physical transducer can be optical, electrochemical, thermometric, piezoelectric, magnetic, or micromechanical. this interaction generates a signal (electrochemical, optical, acoustical, mechanical, calorimetric, or electronic) that is amplified and proportional to the concentration sensitivity and timeliness of culture results are influenced by many factors, especially for hospitalized patients with previously administered and/or concurrent antimicrobial treatment. the nucleic acids detected may be from nonviable organisms or from commensal (nonpathogenic) or colonizing bacteria or viruses that are noncontributory to the disease. the detection of nucleic acids of a coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species is very different than detection in an immunocompetent 30-year-old with community-acquired pneumonia. the answer is not so straightforward when CMV viremia is detected in a patient with fever in the ICU whose blood cultures are negative for bacteria. novel molecular technologies may lead to new insights into disease pathogenesis. sequencing, mass spectrometry, and other complex tests bring their own challenges. how genotypic data relate to phenotypic data may also be unknown. the potential market for a new diagnostic product is estimated, research and development costs are anticipated, the costs of clinical trials and regulatory requirements are calculated, and the potential return on investment is determined. the next phase is technical feasibility, which progresses as a function of multiple factors, including creativity, availability of materials, and freedom to operate. the number of microbiology laboratories willing to take part in clinical trials of new products has shrunk over the last decade, limited even further by conflict of interest rules, institutional regulations, and overhead costs. the company has likely had multiple interactions with the FDA, resulting in agreement on reference methods to be used in clinical trial design. bidirectional sequencing of target nucleic acids from organisms or directly from clinical samples is used as the ultimate arbitrator of positivity or negativity [71] cost of nucleic acid sequence analysis can add >$100 000 to the cost of a clinical trial. cost of nucleic acid sequence analysis can add >$100 000 to the cost of a clinical trial. a current infectious diseases biorepository contains prospectively collected and archived samples from at-risk subjects. the repository can provide companies that are developing diagnostics for aspergillosis with a source of positive and negative clinical samples. a second approach is an on-demand model where access to prospectively collected samples is made available to companies with a demonstrated product. small companies often underestimate the effort and expense required to coordinate the manufacture of parts, kit production, shipping of product, and subsequent technical support. laboratory-developed tests (LDTs) are in vitro diagnostic tests that are developed, validated, and used primarily for in-house pathology and diagnostic testing. high-risk LDTs be assured to provide clinically relevant information to clinicians and their patients. it is incumbent upon the laboratory that is submitting samples for testing using an LDT to substantiate the accuracy and performance of the test prior to sending samples. the global Regulatory Environment The united states is not the only country that has regulations for the marketing of in vitro diagnostic products. private partnerships, venture capital companies, and pharmaceutical companies have been more fruitful, yielding a number of successful products. the SBIR program and public\u2013private partnerships between industry and the federal government have been more fruitful, yielding a number of successful products. there would be considerable synergy between pharmaceutical and diagnostics companies that could share the costs of both development and clinical trials. the next phase is technical feasibility, which progresses as a function of multiple factors, including creativity. conflict of interest rules impact the ability of a company to get independent validation of novel test methods in a real-world laboratory setting. even clinical trials to evaluate new products under the auspices of an institutional review board may now be considered conflicts of interest if the laboratory is compensated. bidirectional sequencing of target nucleic acids from organisms or directly from clinical samples is used as the ultimate arbitrator of positivity or negativity [71] cost of nucleic acid sequence analysis can add >$100 000 to the cost of a clinical trial, which may be prohibitive for smaller companies. there are challenges to successful implementation of repositories, as acknowledged by TATFAR. the key issues are the costs of maintaining thousands of samples that may or may not be used, and that may or may not be the appropriate specimens for a given assay in development. commercialization of well-established PCR assays, such as an assay for HSV to diagnose meningoencephalitis from CSF, is quite difficult. small companies often underestimate the effort and expense required to coordinate the manufacture of parts, kit production, shipping of product, and subsequent technical support. many diagnostic molecular tests are not available commercially and therefore are being used at geographically distant states from where the clinical specimen was obtained. the global Regulatory Environment The united states is not the only country that has regulations for the marketing of in vitro diagnostic products. many small companies seek funding from a variety of sources, including government grants, public\u2013private partnerships, venture capital companies, and pharmaceutical companies to finance their research and development efforts. the SBIR program and public\u2013private partnerships between industry and the federal government have yielded a number of successful products. a conflict begins to emerge between the diagnostic company that wants to develop a product with broad clinical utility and marketability (ie, one that detects multiple infectious agents) and the pharmaceutical company that is interested in both a limited panel of infectious agents (often a single organism) and a limited financial commitment. a major barrier to adoption of diagnostic tests is that tests may not address the needs of a given clinical setting. testing results require knowledge of principles of PCR Collaboration between clinical microbiology laboratory and clinical specialties. testing results require knowledge of principles of PCR Collaboration between clinical microbiology laboratory and clinical specialties; additional training of healthcare providers Abbreviations: IDSA/ATS, infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society. clinician education is a key requirement for successful uptake and appropriate use of new diagnostic tests. clinician education is a key requirement for successful uptake and appropriate use of new diagnostic tests. challenges in resource-limited settings may impact availability of diagnostic tests in both resource-limited settings around the world as well as rural settings in the united states. new technologies may be too complex for all levels of healthcare. codes for diagnostic tests are developed under the CPT system maintained by the American Medical Association (AMA) the international classification of diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification are used in combination with CPT codes in billing. applications for new CPT codes must be submitted to the AMA CPT Editorial Panel according to a specific schedule 3 times per year. novel diagnostics are a challenge given that CMS may not easily be able to determine whether to use cross-walking or gap filling to set reimbursement. compliance and billing remain challenges for clinical laboratories and may also limit the availability of testing. molecular tests with increased sensitivity compared to an EIA led to better detection of C. trachomatis infections in women. cost of the molecular test was significantly higher than the cost of the EIA. multiple studies have shown a reduction in antibiotic use, hospital costs and ancillary tests. MALDI-TOF MS instruments are recently available for use in clinical microbiology laboratories. combining the use of MALDI-TOF MS for the identification of bacteria and yeast provided results several days earlier compared to standard identification methods with a substantial reduction in reagent and labor costs. more work needs to be done to assess the cost-effectiveness of diagnostic tests. microbiologists are faced with supporting classical culture and other methods with less than ideal performance characteristics. some of the tests on current molecular platforms take an entire day to perform and require technologists who are highly trained in molecular techniques. the crisis in medical technology education, an aging workforce, and the difficulty in recruiting and retaining technologists have resulted in less technical specialists. tests are not difficult for organisms that are prevalent, but for the rare pathogen or disease, finding clinical material may be difficult. the laboratory may need to find enough specimens containing 12\u201322 different pathogens. this requires tremendous resources and can significantly delay assay implementation. newer assays often are more sensitive than the existing reference method. the problem then becomes how to resolve results that are positive by the new method, but negative by the \u201cgold standard\u201d in some cases the old gold standard is called into question. many laboratories with extensive experience in conducting FDA trials may not have the infrastructure to obtain consent. sputum culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing Typically ranges from 24 to 72 hours Rapid testing, eg, molecular diagnostics, MALDI-TOF MS Lack of outcomes data Rapid molecular testing Limited data on morbidity and mortality benefit of molecular panels for respiratory pathogens. clinician education is a key requirement for successful uptake and appropriate use of new diagnostic tests. clinicians will not understand the potential value and appropriate use of new tests. clinical guidelines and professional society guidelines influence how diagnostic tests are incorporated into clinical practice for infectious diseases. infectious diseases clinicians serve as a critical liaison between healthcare providers and the clinical microbiology lab. in many cases, rapid molecular tests cost is high and thus the tests are not available as standard of care, or they may not be billed as a reimbursable test. tests are best performed near the patient as either POC tests or in rapid response laboratories. results data with clinically relevant parameters are critical for providers to effectively use any laboratory assay. clinical guidelines and professional society guidelines influence how diagnostic tests are incorporated into clinical practice. clinician education is a key requirement for successful uptake and appropriate use of new diagnostic tests. recent changes and developments in rapid molecular tests have outpaced clinician awareness and uptake. new technologies may be too complex for all levels of healthcare. the robustness of technology breakage and the needs for maintenance are too onerous for many settings. distance of reference laboratories and specimen transport remain a significant barrier for resource-limited settings. applications for new CPT codes must be submitted to the AMA CPT Editorial Panel according to a specific schedule 3 times per year. coverage of these tests may vary by insurer, and current coding and payment mechanisms often do not reflect the value of new diagnostic tests. reimbursement does not cover the cost of the test, which limits lab interest in offering the test. in other cases the charge may be high but leave considerable cost to the patient, thus limiting clinicians from ordering the test routinely. cost-effectiveness is another important consideration for use of a diagnostic test. the cost of the molecular test was significantly higher than the cost of the EIA. multiple studies have shown a reduction in antibiotic use, hospital costs, ancillary tests, and/or length of hospital stay. a 2010 historically controlled study illustrated the importance of ensuring clinical response to rapid testing. the success of diagnostic tests requires that the test be performed in a timely manner with rapid communication of results to the team providing care to the patient. concerns regarding reimbursement for new or expensive diagnostic tests may hamper innovation and are a significant challenge to the widespread use of these technologies. Medicare pays for outpatient laboratory tests according to fee schedules. but most reimbursement decisions are made locally rather than at the national level. new diagnostics are a challenge given that CMS may not easily be able to determine whether to use cross-walking to set reimbursement. cost-effectiveness is another important consideration for use of a diagnostic test. the newer molecular tests may increase the cost to the laboratory while leading to decreased length of stay, reduced antibiotic use, or other savings that more than offset the additional cost of the test. reus and MRSA were performed on blood cultures with Gram stain results showing gram-positive cocci in clusters. the results were immediately paged to both the responsible physician and an infectious diseases pharmacist. the results were immediately paged to both the responsible physician and an infectious diseases pharmacist. diagnostic microbiology laboratories are unique in the variety of specimens submitted and processed. the more difficult it is to collect, process, and transport a specimen, the lower the likelihood it is to be done correctly. the more difficult it is to collect, process, and transport a specimen, the lower the likelihood it is to be done correctly. retaining technologists has resulted in fewer technical specialists in anaerobic bacteriology, mycology, mycobacteriology, and parasitology. many facilities outsource this work to large reference laboratories, compromising specimen integrity and potential recovery. the consequence is that less knowledge about the biology of infectious diseases is found in the laboratory. the laboratory may need to find enough specimens containing 12\u201322 different pathogens. this requires tremendous resources and can significantly delay assay implementation. the problem is how to resolve results that are positive by the new method, but negative by the \u201cgold standard\u201d. a laboratory may need to find enough specimens containing 12\u201322 different pathogens. this requires tremendous resources and can significantly delay assay implementation. the laboratory faces a dilemma when a target on a panel becomes positive. a new virus in a respiratory panel is yet to be verified. the laboratory cannot offer the test (or report the specific analyte) or must go through great expense and effort to validate the analyte. in some cases the old gold standard (eg, C. trachomatis culture or C. difficile EIA testing) is called into question. one technology, MALDI-TOF MS, is poised to completely change the identification of bacterial and fungal pathogens, allowing for identification within a few minutes after growth on media. but despite these extraordinary technological advances, challenges remain. to NIH for diagnostics research, including the SBIR diagnostics program at NIAID and the Point-of-Care Technologies Research Network at NIBIB To the CDC AMD initiative Unmet Needs, R&D Challenges (Section IV) Congress Enact legislation to support a tax credit to cover 50% of clinical research costs. the metric Point-of-care diagnostic testing allows for use in varied clinical settings Unmet Needs, new technologies (Sections II, III) Expedite integration of improved diagnostic tests into patient care CMS. healthcare systems should use clinical guidelines from IDSA and other professional societies to guide patient management decisions regarding diagnostics use. Congress Provide incentives and support for institutions to save de-identified specimens when possible for the purposes of new test development, FDA licensing trials, and assay verification and validation R&D Challenges, Adoption Challenges (Sections IV, V) CDRH should revise the guidance for RUO/IUO devices and permit use in cases where there are no other diagnostic options CDRH should exercise its flexibility. diagnostic companies Convert highly complex assays to moderately complex tests that can be performed in a variety of clinical settings using \u201cwalk-away technology\u201d Promote industry training in new technologies for the laboratory workforce Adoption Challenges (Section V) Congress and HRSA, with professional societies Support the recruitment and retention of clinical microbiologists. progress will require the engagement and coordination of a number of stakeholders including funding agencies, regulatory agencies, public health agencies, diagnostic companies, healthcare systems, clinical microbiology laboratory professionals, clinicians, and professional societies. congress must play a role in increasing funding for diagnostics research and enacting legislation that addresses identified challenges."}
