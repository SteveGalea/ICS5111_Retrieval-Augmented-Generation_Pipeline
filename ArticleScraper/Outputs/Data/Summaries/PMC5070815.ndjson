{"summary": "polyadenylation process involves two discrete phases. synthesis of a short poly(A) tail of nearly 10 nucleotides (nts) depends on interaction between polyadenylation-related proteins and the polyadenylation signal (PAS) hexamer AAUAAA or its variant (AGUAAA, AUUAAA or UAUAAA) ovirus uses homopolymeric stretch on negative-strand as template for polyadenylation. hexamer AAUAAA in bamboo mosaic virus and domain upstream of poly(A) tail in coxsackievirus B3 have been shown to function as cis-acting elements involved in both negative-strand RNA synthesis and polyadenylation. a regulated poly(A) tail length during the coronaviruses life cycle has been suggested. the results presented here provide the first genetic evidence that will help in elucidating coronaviral polyadenylation. the results presented here provide the first genetic evidence that will help in elucidating coronaviral polyadenylation. the resulting PCR product was cloned into the TOPO XL vector (Invitrogen) and digested with SpeI and MluI. the digested fragment was then cloned into SpeI- and MluI-linearized pW-25A to generate the mutant pR-25A. pR-5A, pR-8A, pR-12A, pR-15A, pR-18, pR-20A, pR(C)-25A, pR-25U, pR-25C, and pR-25G were linearized with MluI. the linearized DNA was transcribed in vitro with the mMessage mMachine T7 transcription kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen) at the indicated times after transfection of DI RNA constructs into BCoV-infected HRT-18 cells. the virus within the transfected cells is referred to as virus passage 0 (VP0) RNA was phenol-chloroform-extracted, dissolved in 25 l of water, heat-denatured at 95\u00b0C for 5 min and quick-cooled. head-to-tail ligation was then performed by adding 3 l of 10X ligase buffer and 2 U (in 2 l) of T4 RNA ligase I. superScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) is able to transcribe poly(A) tails HRT-18 cells were seeded in 35-mm dishes at 80% confluency (8 105 cells/dish) for RNA stability assay, 3 g of DI RNA transcript was transfected into the cells. Tthe supernatant was harvested at 48 hpt (VP0) and 500 l was used to infect freshly confluent HRT-18 cells in a 35-mm dish. pR-25A was replaced with 301-nt 3\u2019 UTR and 25-nt poly(A) tail of mouse hepatitis virus-A59. oligonucleotides TGEV 7() and R(+) and pW-25A DNA in the first PCR, and oligonucleotides TGEV 7() and pW-25A DNA in the second PCR. each PCR product was cloned into the TOPO-XL vector (Invitrogen) and digested with SpeI and MluI. the digested fragment was then cloned into SpeI- and MluI-linearized pW-25A to generate the mutant pR-25A. mutants pM1-15A, pM2-15A, pM3-15A, pM4-15A, pM5-15A, pPAS-R-15A and pPAS-PAS-15A were transcribed in vitro. the linearized DNA was transcribed in vitro with the mMessage mMachine T7 transcription kit (Ambion) RNA was extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen) at the indicated times after transfection of DI RNA constructs into BCoV-infected and DI RNA transfected HRT-18 cells. the virus within the transfected cells is referred to as virus passage 0 (VP0) ligation was performed by adding 3 l of 10X ligase buffer and 2 U (in 2 l) of T4 RNA ligase I. superScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) was used for the RT reaction. oligonucleotide BCV29-54(+) binds to nts 29\u201354 of leader sequence of the BCoV positive strand. 3 g of DI RNA transcript was transfected into the HRT-18 cells. cDNA prepared from head-to-tail ligation RNA collected at 1 and 24 hpi of VP1 was used for real-time PCR amplification. coronaviral poly(A) tail length is increased in the early stage of infection. the poly(A) tail length is decreased after the peak tail length in the later stage of infection. a series of bovine coronavirus DI RNAs with various poly(A) tail lengths were constructed and tested. qRT-PCR was applied for the evaluation of the replication efficiency of the DI RNAs. the intensity of RT-PCR product shown in S2 Fig may not represent the replication efficiency of the DI RNAs. qRT-PCR was applied for the evaluation of the replication efficiency of the DI RNAs. the intensity of RT-PCR product was increased with the time of infection in VP1. the results were confirmed by qRT-PCR (S3A and S3B Fig, lower panels) suggesting that the detected poly(A) tails of DI RNA W-15A were not from input DI RNAs but from replicating DI RNAs. coronaviral poly(A) tail length of DI RNA increased from 8 nts at 48 hpt (VP0) to 10 nts at 8 hpi of VP1. the level of lengthening was found to be correlated to the initial length of the poly(A) tail. the level of lengthening was found to be correlated to the initial length of the poly(A) tail. xamer AGUAAA and poly(A) tail length on coronaviral polyadenylation Interactions between consensus polyadenylation signal (PAS) hexamer AAUAAA or its variant (AGUAAA, AUUAAA or UAUAAA) located10\u201330 nts upstream of the poly(A) cleavage site. eukaryotic mRNAs are 3\u2019 polyadenylated and subgenomic amer AGUAAA only had a minor effect on coronavirus polyadenylation when the tail length of the input R-25A was 25 nts. the replication efficiency of R-25A was impaired in comparison with that of W-25A. to exclude the possibility that the detected poly(A) tail is from the potential recombination between the DI RNA and BCoV genome. the UCAUUU sequence in DI RNA mutant R-25A did not revert back to the wild-type AGUAAA at 24 hpi of VP1. the RNA stability (Fig 2C), replication efficiency (Fig 2D) and recombination between DI RNA and BCoV genome may not be the major factors in determining the poly(A) tail length. recombinant DNA of 1,639 nts between DI RNA and BCoV genome shown in lane 4 was produced by overlap PCR and used as a size marker. hexamer AGUAAA may not be required for coronaviral polyadenylation when the tail on input DI RNA is 25 nts long. hexamer AGUAAA-deficient R-25A was not synthesized for W-0A. the level of poly(A) tail synthesis for hexamer AGUAAA-deficient R-25A was similar to that for hexamer AGUAAA-containing W-25A. to test our hypotheses and further elucidate the role of the AGUAAA hexamer in coronaviral polyadenylation, we created a series of DI RT-PCR products were observed for AGUAAA-deficient R-12A. however, no clear poly(A) tail was identified. after sequencing, the poly(A) tail length of W-12A was found to be 9 nts. the synthesized poly(A) tail length for the AGUAAA-deficient DI RNA was similar to that of packaged DI RNA in infected cells. we also applied RT-PCR and sequencing to identify the poly(A) tail length of R-20A at 48 hpt (VP0) the length of poly(A) tail for R-20A was determined to be 18 nts at 48 hpt. hexamer AGUAAA was substituted with UCAUUU or maintained. RT-PCR products synthesized using the method described in Fig RNA samples were collected at 24 hpi of VP1 from cells treated with the supernatant from DI RNA-transfected BCoV-infected cells. the stability of selected DI RNA variants is almost the same. for the factor of replication efficiency, DI RNA was not detectable by Northern blot assay from R-15A and R-20A. however, the poly(A) tail length for both constructs was different. poly(A) tail was first replaced with the same length of a poly(U), poly(C) or poly(G) tail to create mutants W-25U, W-25C or W-25G. mutants were then transfected into BCoV-infected cells to examine whether a poly(A) tail is synthesized and where on the DI RNA it is added if the tail is identified. poly(A) tail can be synthesized from DI RNA without a poly(A) tail sequence such as W-25U, W-25C and W-25G. if the hexamer AGUAAA is mutated, lack of poly(A) tail synthesis may reinforce the important role of the AGUAAA in coronaviral polyadenylation. hexamer AGUAAA-deficient DI RNA constructs with a poly(A) tail or other non-poly(A) sequences immediately downstream of the 3\u2019UTR. dissection of hexamer AGUAAA by mutagenesis to further characterize its role in coronaviral polyadenylation. the effect on poly(A) tail synthesis was evaluated. the poly(A) tail length decreases with the increased mutations within the hexamer. these results further support our finding that the AGUAAA hexamer functions as a cis-acting element in coronaviral polyadenylation. the function of the hexamer AGUAAA in polyadenylation is position dependent Based on the data presented here, this hexamer AGUAAA is involved in coronaviral polyadenylation. the sequence in W-15A between 37 and 42 nts upstream of the poly(A) tail site was replaced with UCAUUU. mutant PAS-PAS-15A was also constructed in which the sequence between 49 and 54 nts upstream of the poly RT-PCR products were observed for all constructs at 24 hpi of VP1. the poly(A) tail lengths were determined to be 5, 15, 4 and 13 nts for PAS-R-15A, PAS-PAS-15A, R-15A and W-15A respectively. these results suggest the sequence substitution between 49 and 54 with hexamer AGUAAA in PAS-PAS-15A did not affect the efficiency of polyadenylation. the function of the hexamer AGUAAA in coronaviral polyadenylation is position dependent. the number above the sequence indicates the position of nt counted from poly(A) tail. the hexamer AGUAAA or its variants are found among coronaviruses. the hexamer AGUAAA is located between 37 and 42 nts upstream of the poly(A) site in BCoV. other hexamers have also been identified in alphacoronavirus, betacoronavirus B, betacoronavirus D, and gammacoronavirus. the hexamer has similar functions in coronaviruses other than BCoV.

RT-PCR products with the size of less than 200 bp (S2 Fig) were detected and subjected to sequencing to determine the poly(A) tail length. the MHV-specific primer can be used for RT-PCR to determine the length of the DI RNA poly(A) tail. the intensity of RT-PCR product shown in Fig 1B may not represent the replication efficiency of the DI RNAs. qRT-PCR was applied for the evaluation of the replication efficiency for DI RNAs W-0A and W-5A at different time points of VP1. similar results were obtained for DI RNA W-25A (with an initial poly(A) tail length of 25 nts) but increased to 31 nts at 8 hpi of VP1 and then gradually decreased to 24 nts and 19 nts at 24 and 48 hpi of VP1 respectively. the level of lengthening was found to be correlated to the initial length of the poly(A) tail. poly(A) tail lengths synthesized at 48h of VP0 and 8h of VP1 for these DI RNA constructs during infection. poly(A) tail lengths for DI RNA constructs at different times, as determined by sequencing the RT-PCR products shown in Fig 1A. the hexamer in BCoV DI RNA W-25A was mutated from AGUAAA to UCAUUU; the resulting DI RNA was designated R-25A. RNA was collected at 24 hpi of VP1, and the RT-PCR product was detected and subjected to sequencing analysis. the replication efficiency of R-25A was impaired in comparison with that of W-25A. the synthesized poly(A) tail may originate from genome of helper virus BCoV. it is possible that the synthesized poly(A) tail may originate from genome of the helper virus BCoV via homologous recombination in this region. the mutated nt C was still maintained at 24 hpi of VP1. lengths of R-25A and W-25A poly(A) tails at 24 hpi of VP1. transcripts were transfected and RNA was extracted at the times indicated. the amount of each DI RNA at 24 hpt was quantitated and compared with that at 1 hpt. hexamer AGUAAA may not be required for coronaviral polyadenylation when the poly(A) tail on input DI RNA is 25 nts long. both the hexamer AGUAAA and poly(A) tail may contribute to coronaviral polyadenylation through concerted action when the tail is shorter than 25 nts on input DI RNA. RT-PCR products were observed for W-5A- or W-8A-transfected cells at the same time point with poly(A) tail lengths of 5 and 8 nts. however, an RT-PCR product was detected for AGUAAA-deficient R-12A, but subsequent sequencing revealed a poly(A) tail length of 3 nts. poly(A) tail length in AGUAAA-deficient DI RNA is shorter than that in AGUAAA-containing DI RNA. hexamer AGUAAA is not required for coronaviral polyadenylation when the tail length on input DI RNA transcript reached 20 nts. hexamer AGUAAA is not required for polyadenylation when the tail length on input DI RNA transcript reached 20 nts. hexamer AGUAAA is involved in coronaviral polyadenylation. the poly(A) tail length plays an important role in coronaviral polyadenylation. the initial length of poly(A) tail length is shorter than 18 nts. this conclusion, therefore, supports our hypothesis. recombinant DNA of 1,639 nts between DI RNA and BCoV genome shown in lane 6 was produced by overlap PCR and used as a size marker. the stability of selected DI RNA variants is almost the same, suggesting replication efficiency may not play a major role in polyadenylation. poly(A) tail in DI RNAs originates from the helper virus BCoV. the length in DI RNAs is expected to be longer than 40 nts. the longest length is 31 nts in W-25A at 8 hpi of VP1. poly(A) tails with lengths of 18 and 21 nts were found on W-25U and W-25C. the position where the tail was added was not at the 3\u2019 terminus of the 3\u2019 UTR but at the 3\u2019 terminus of the 3\u2019 UTR. a poly(A) tail was not found until 48 hpi of VP1. poly(A) tail was not synthesized for R-25U and R-25C at 24 and 48 hpi of VP1. hexamer AGUAAA-deficient DI RNA constructs with a poly(A) tail or other non-poly(A) sequences immediately downstream of the 3\u2019UTR. decreased poly(A) tail synthesis efficiency was found for M3-15A (8 nts) and M4-15A (10 nts) the resulting poly(A) tail length was 3 nts, the same as that obtained for R-15A in which the entire hexamer was substituted. amer AGUAAA is an important cis-element in coronavirus polyadenylation. hexamer AGUAAA is involved in coronaviral polyadenylation. hexamer AGUAAA was replaced with UCAUUU. RT-PCR products were observed for all constructs at 24 hpi of VP1. the poly(A) tail lengths were determined to be 5, 15, 4 and 13 nts for PAS-R-15A, PAS-PAS-15A, R-15A and W-15A respectively. the sequence substitution between 49 and 54 with hexamer AGUAAA in PAS-PAS-15A did not affect the efficiency of polyadenylation. hexamer AGUAAA in coronaviral polyadenylation is position dependent. substitution mutation between 49 and 54 nts or 37 and 42 nts upstream of poly(A) site has only minor or no effect on polyadenylation. RNA samples were collected at 24 hpi of VP1. hexamer AGUAAA or its variants are found among coronaviruses. hexamer AAUAAA is one of the cis-acting elements responsible for eukaryotic mRNA polyadenylation. s can be from 24 to 57 nts upstream of the poly(A) tail. it remains to be determined whether the hexamer has similar functions in coronaviruses other than BCoV.

increased to 62 nts at 8 hpi of VP1. results led us to ask the question of what the minimum poly(A) tail length required to initiate tail lengthening of coronavirus. hexamer AGUAAA and hexamer AGUAAA are involved in coronaviral polyadenylation. a poly(A) tail length shorter than 20 nts was consistently found for coronaviral RNA. hexamer AGUAAA and poly(A) tail contribute to virus survival. a MHV-A59 poly(A) tail length of less than 20 nts was also frequently found in persistent infection. hexamer AGUAAA along with poly(A) tail may be required to restore efficient polyadenylation for subsequent translation and replication. the size of poly(A) tail in BCoV varies at different time points of infection. small alternations in poly(A) tail size from 5 to 10 nts and from 25 to 45 nts in coronavirus dramatically increase the efficiency of viral replication and translation. however, the small changes in the poly(A) tail length may increase the efficiency of viral replication and translation. replication efficiency was similar to that of W-15A at the stage of 24 hpi of VP1. however, the synthesized poly(A) tail length was different. this suggests replication efficiency may not play a major role in poly(A) tail synthesis. the unidentified poly(A) tail may be attributed to the undetected RT-PCR product. it is reasonable to speculate that the hexamer AGUAAA may not play a role in the replication. however, the results suggest that the replication efficiency is decreased in DI RNA R-25A with mutated hexamer AGUAAA. coronavirus polymerase uses positive-strand viral RNA as a template to synthesize negative-strand viral RNA with a poly(U) tract. the negative-strand viral RNA serves as a template for synthesizing the positive-strand viral RNA. the nascent negative-strand RNA serves as a template for synthesizing positive-strand RNA. hexamer AGUAAA on positive-strand RNA is copied. binding of related proteins to the positive strand and that of polyadenylation-related proteins to the poly(U) tract on the negative strand is a key step in coronaviral polyadenylation. a poly(A) tail was synthesized from poly(A)-deficient DI RNA constructs W-25U, W-25C, and W-25G. polyadenylation-related protein binding to RNA elements at the 5\u2019 end of negative-strand viral RNA is not sufficient to form a stable RNA-protein complex. if polyadenylation-related protein binding to RNA elements at the 5\u2019 end of negative-strand viral RNA is not sufficient, assistance from interactions between the AGUAAA motif and proteins may be required for polyadenylation. the results led us to ask the question of what the minimum poly(A) tail length required to initiate tail lengthening of coronavirus DI RNA is. in order to precisely identify the minimum requirement to initiate the lengthening of poly(A) tail, only a small variation in poly(A) tail length from these DI RNA constructs was expected in the process of infection. hexamer AGUAAA and hexamer AGUAAA are involved in coronaviral polyadenylation. a poly(A) tail length shorter than 20 nts was consistently found for coronaviral RNA collected from (i) BCoV-infected HRT-18 cells at 2 hpi and (ii) mouse brain at 5 days postinfection with MHV-A59. a MHV-A59 poly(A) tail length of less than 20 nts was also frequently found. the AGUAAA along with the poly(A) tail may be required to restore efficient polyadenylation for subsequent translation and replication, contributing to virus survival under these conditions. coronavirus has short poly(A) tail length ranging from 13 to 68 nts. ts in coronavirus dramatically increase the efficiency of viral replication. ts in coronavirus may increase the efficiency of viral replication. the replication efficiency for both R-15A and R-20A was similar. however, both were detected by RT-PCR. the unidentified poly(A) tail from R-5A may be attributed to the undetected RT-PCR product. hexamer AGUAAA is located between 37 and 42 nts upstream of poly(A) tail. it is reasonable to speculate that the deletion of nts 30\u2013170 upstream of poly(A) tail may not play a role in the replication. however, the results suggest that the replication efficiency is decreased in DI RNA R-25A with mutated hexamer AGUAAA. negative-strand viral RNA serves as a template for synthesizing positive-strand viral RNA. after hexamer AGUAAA is copied, cytoplasmic polyadenylation-associated factors may interact with the hexamer on the positive strand. this hexamer-protein complex may interact with (an)other complex(es) formed by interactions between proteins and the poly(U) tract on the negative strand. poly(A) tail was synthesized from poly(A)-deficient DI RNA constructs W-25U, W-25C, and W-25G, rather than poly(A)-deficient DI RNA W-0A. a poly(A) tail was found for R-15A and R-18A, but not R-25U, R25C and R25G, despite the fact that they all lack the hexamer AGUAAA. negative-strand viral RNA is not sufficient to form a stable RNA-protein complex. the hexamer AGUAAA motif was able to bind to poly(A), poly(G) or poly(C) on the negative strand of R-25U, R-25C or R-25G. this model may be extended to explain why different levels of hexamer AGUAAA mutation decreased the efficiency of polyadenylation on DI RNA.
