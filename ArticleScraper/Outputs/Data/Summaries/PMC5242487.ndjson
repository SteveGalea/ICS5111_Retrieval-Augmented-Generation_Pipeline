{"summary": "the virus is a highly contagious and deadly coronavirus that was only observed in Asian and European swine herds prior to 2013. the virus is a highly contagious and deadly coronavirus that was only observed in Asian and European swine herds prior to 2013. the FSRC is a biosafety level-2 (BSL-2) laboratory with pilot scale feed manufacturing equipment. the FSRC includes a containment mode, where a separate air handling system with HEPA filtration and biosafety protocols restrict pathogen exit during operation of equipment. the swab tubes were vortexed briefly before 50 L of fluid was transferred to a 96-well plate. each 96-well RT-qPCR plate included an extraction positive control (PEDV inoculum) and an extraction negative control (1x PBS). PCR positive control (known PEDV-positive RNA sample) and a PCR negative control (water) results were analyzed using the CFX ManagerTM Software (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) 500 mL of the thawed virus was mixed with 4.5 kg of the corn-soybean meal-based diet. the previously prepared inoculum was added to 45 kg of a corn-soybean meal-based diet in a 0.113 m3 electric paddle mixer. the feed was then discharged at a rate of approximately 4.5 kg per minute into the leg of the bucket elevator (Universal Industries, Cedar Falls, IA) a temperature of 60\u00b0C or higher was maintained for a minimum of 48 hours. a temperature of 60\u00b0C or higher was maintained for a minimum of 48 hours. the facility was allowed to cool back to ambient temperature. each 96-well RT-qPCR plate included an extraction positive control (PEDV inoculum) and an extraction negative control (1x PBS) a duplex real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) targeting the Spike gene of PEDV and host 18S rRNA (internal control) was used for the detection and quantification of PEDV. the virus was divided into three, 500 ml aliquots with one aliquot used in each replication. 500 mL of the thawed virus was mixed with 4.5 kg of the corn-soybean meal-based diet. the feed exited the bucket elevator through a downspout, collected, and then converted to pellets using a pilot-scale single pass conditioner and pellet mill (Model CL5, CPM, Waterloo, IA). Upon completion of converting the inoculated mash into pellets, remaining organic material on all equipment and surfaces was physically removed followed by a 5% sodium hypochlorite solution (5% solution in water; Chlorox, Oakland, CA) results were analyzed using the proc GLM procedure of SAS. all interactions were considered, but non-significant interactions were removed from the model statement. results were considered significant at P 0.05. all collected environmental swabs were categorized by decontamination step, surface collected from (concrete, metal, plastic, or rubber), surface type (equipment or structural) and zone (1, 2, or 3) the main effects of decontamination step, surface (concrete, metal, plastic, or rubber), are shown in Table 3. factor P = Main effects Decontamination stepa 0.0001 Surfaceb 0.0018 Typec 0.0010 Zoned 0.0001 Two-way interactions Decontamination step surface 0.0001 Decontamination step type 0.0002 Surface type 0.0002 Type zone 0.0002 Three-way interactions Decontamination step surface type zone 0.0001 Four-way interactions Decontamination step surface type zone 0.0001 aCompared samples collected at each of the 5 decontamination steps. 6 of 157 (3.8%) of the collected samples were positive for PEDV RNA. swabs collected after decontamination were negative for PEDV RNA. the percentage contamination of PEDV on each surface type (concrete, metal, plastic, or rubber) from baseline to final decontamination step was significant (P = 0.0018; Table 3). concrete and metal surfaces were not significantly different from each other. all swabs collected from equipment surfaces contained PEDV RNA. the quantity of viral RNA between the equipment and structural swabs was statistically different. this was expected due to the equipment being in direct contact with the contaminated feed. the majority of collected structural swabs were positive. positive swabs were obtained after decontamination during replication 2. the same overall trend was observed when looking at swabs collected from the different zones (1, 2, or 3). positive rates followed by facility heating were effective measures to reduce PEDV in feed manufacturing facilities and equipment. findings may provide solutions for biological hazard reduction on specific equipment or problem areas."}
