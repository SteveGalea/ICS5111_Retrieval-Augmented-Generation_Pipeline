{"summary": "delays between disease onset and laboratory confirmation (disease identification delay) and between notification and reporting to the national institute for public health and the environment (reporting delay) were analysed for 28 notifiable diseases. there were substantial reporting delays for four of six investigated diseases. report delay on local level is the result of (i) the incubation time, (ii) the time until the patient decides to seek medical care, (iv) delayed laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis and (v) delayed notifications by physicians and laboratories to the local health department (LHD) or municipal health services (MHS) in the Netherlands. the timeframe for reporting from the MHS to the NHS, the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM); D6 in Figure 1) was reduced for some group B and C diseases: from 7 to 3 days for hepatitis A, Q fever and psittacosis, and from 1 month to 7 days for pertussis and malaria. hepatitis C and chronic hepatitis B were excluded as date of disease onset was not known. we also excluded rare diseases with less than 10 notifications in the full study period. ns of D1X, D3 and D6 were calculated for all cases per disease and for all diseases together, for each of three periods: period 1 (P1): notification to the MHS between July 2003 and January 2009 (former law), period 2 (P2) between January 2009 and January 2013 and period 3 (P3) between January 2013 and November 2017. midpoints of the ranges of incubation periods for 10 person-to-person transmissible diseases were retrieved from the national guidelines of the RIVM. a timeframe for outbreak control was calculated by Bonai et al. for six person-to-person transmissible diseases based on the proportion (PIR2) of expected new infections produced by each secondary case at the time of notification of the index case to the MHS. six national outbreaks, including rubella (October 2004\u2013January 2006), measles (March 2013\u2013March 2014), meningococcosis W (March 2016\u2013November 2017), hepatitis A (October 2016\u2013November 2017) and mumps (two outbreaks periods: December 2009\u2013January 2014 and April 2015\u2013January 2016) group A diseases (polio, smallpox, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and viral haemorrhagic fever) were excluded as they were notifiable upon suspicion. we also excluded rare diseases with less than 10 notifications in the full study period. medians of D1X, D3 and D6 were calculated for all cases per disease and for all diseases together, for each of three periods: period 1 (P1), period 2 (P2) between January 2009 and January 2013 and period 3 (P3) between January 2013 and November 2017. a timeframe for outbreak control was calculated by Bonai et al. for six person-to-person transmissible diseases based on the proportion (PIR2) of expected new infections produced by each secondary case. the number of cases produced by each secondary case is PIR2 multiplied by the reproduction number. our study period (2003\u20132017) addressed in the signalling reports and (laboratory)inf@ct alerts. 144,066 notifications of 28 different infectious diseases included. median disease identification delay D1X, notification delay D3 and reporting delay D6, per disease and for all cases are displayed for each period in Table 1. for all three delays, the medians for all cases together decreased over time. the mathematical averages of median delays of all individual diseases decreased as well. 0 NA 130 19 NA

most variation between diseases. medians ranged between 2 days (meningococcosis in period 1 and tetanus in period 2) and 55 days (brucellosis in period 3). median notification delay decreased in period 2 for most diseases (10/18, with 4/10 statistically significant), see Table 1. a significant decrease was observed for pertussis, malaria, leptospirosis and psittacosis. in period 3, this delay decreased further (12/18 diseases, with 6/12 statistically significant) a IQR: 25th\u201375th percentile in boxes, values between 1.5 IQR (lines) and outliers > 20 were removed to allow the medians and interquartile ranges to be visible in the graph. in 2016\u20132017, the performance threshold of at least 80% timely notification was met, as 82.3% of all 14,447 included notifications were made

Netherlands in the period 2003\u20132017. legal adjustments for mandatory notification to the MHS and reporting to the RIVM led to shorter delays. the decrease of reporting delay observed in 2009 was the result of legal adjustments, as the electronic reporting system between MHS to RIVM did not alter. cquired meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and STEC have in common that they are rare and may need additional laboratory tests after initial confirmation. this delay is of special concern as early identification of a common source is important as early identification of a common source is important. short delays, as those achieved in the Netherlands, are also observed in other european countries. increased awareness during outbreaks and provision of guidance on laboratory testing and notification criteria shortened disease identification. hepatitis A, hepatitis B and measles were only met for the first time in the period 2013\u20132017. this was probably a consequence of the outbreak in 2013\u20132014, when the disease identification delay was reduced by the RIVM alert systems. the performance threshold of measles was close to the threshold of 80%. in some countries such as the united states, specimen collection dates are recorded in the laboratory surveillance system, which gives an indication of laboratory delay. however, dates of doctor\u2019s consultation and laboratory test initiation are not routinely collected in European Union countries. the importance of this information has been highlighted before for pertussis surveillance and control in the Netherlands [20] legal timeliness thresholds overall were achieved, although notification delays can still be shortened for some diseases. also disease identification delays need to be reduced, especially for measles and bacterial gastroenteritis. notification delays Notifications by physicians and laboratories to the MHS are now also timely. the delay is of special concern as early identification of a common source is important. we recommend that MHS monitor notification delays in their region and identify ways of improvement together with local laboratories and involved physicians. however, other developments such as faster notification systems probably contributed. both german and the uk have reported a majority of notifications arriving at LHD within 1 day. increased awareness during outbreaks and provision of guidance on laboratory testing and notification criteria shortened disease identification and notification delays for some diseases. the performance threshold of measles was close to the threshold of 80%. we recommend enhancing doctors\u2019 awareness and optimising laboratory confirmation procedures to achieve early detection of measles cases for optimal outbreak control. in some countries such as the uk and the u.s., specimen collection dates are recorded in the laboratory surveillance system, which gives an indication of laboratory delay. however, dates of doctor\u2019s consultation and laboratory test initiation are not routinely collected in European Union countries. to achieve outbreak control thresholds, disease identification delays need to be reduced. also disease identification delays need to be monitored by the MHS."}
