{"summary": "a total of 872 diarrheic fecal samples from pigs of different ages were collected from 12 districts of Sichuan Province in the southwest of china. RT-PCR was done with PToV S gene specific primers to detect the presence of PToV positive samples. the highest prevalence was observed in piglets aged from 1 to 3 weeks old. the first identified torovirus was isolated from a horse with diarrhea in 1972. in 1983, EToV was found to be able to adapt and grow in equine cells. the genome was found to be 28,301 bp long [13], sharing 79% identity with bovine torovirus (BToV) a total of 872 fecal samples were collected from pigs with diarrhea across different districts of Sichuan Province, china. most of the sampled piglets were 1 to 3 weeks old, 7 to 11 weeks old or over 11 weeks old. cDNA was synthesized from RNA using reverse transcriptase. mol of each primer, 1.0 U Taq DNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), and 1.5 mM MgCl2 in a total volume of 40 l. PCR was performed at 94\u00b0C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles of amplification. all specimens were also tested for the presence of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) and group A rotavirus (R bORF: S: spike protein; VP6: viral protein 6. cF: Forward primer for RT-PCR; nR: Reverse primer for RT-PCR. PCR products were gel-purified using a gel Extraction Kit. logenetic tree was constructed using the Neighbor-Joining method on Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) software version 5.0. the transition/transversion bias (R) and substitution rates were estimated using the Kimura 2-parameter model. nucleotide frequencies of A = 25.00%, T/U = 25.00%, C = 25.00%, and G = 25.00% were eliminated. 26% (4/39) were detected for Ya\u2019an, Leshan, Dazhou, Zigong, Luzhou and Ziyang. the positive rates of PEDV, TGEV, RVA were 62.5% (545/872), 12.5% (109/872) and 66.9% (583/872), respectively. the PToV Co-infected with RVA, TGEV and PEDV positive rate was 4.1% (36/872) /136) 47.1%(64/136) 12.5%(17/136) 3.7%(5/136) Leshan 5.77%(3/52) 71.1%(37/52) 78.8%(41/52) 78.8%(4/52) 5.77%(3/52) 5.77%(3/52) 15.4%(8/52) 3.8%(2/52) Mianyang 51.9%(69/133) 74.4%(99/133) 73.7%(98/133 4%(1/25) 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Suining 42.1%(32/76) 63.2%(48/76) 65.8%(50/76) 25%(19/76) 35.5%(27/76) 42.1%(32/76) 25%(19/76) 9.2%(7/76) Zigong 27.8%(10/36) 47.2%(17/36) 0 5.6%(2/36) 22.2%(8/36) 0 0 0 no.

ELISA reactivity values and rates of seroprevalence rose markedly in piglets from 3 to 11 weeks. RT-PCR cannot reflect infections completely due to swine developing their own immune response to the virus. further immunological methods should be established to develop a more robust serological surveillance of PToV. studies conducted on pigs farmed in Spain reported that the seroprevalence against PToV was > 99% indicating that PToV was endemic in piglets in Spain [17]. most PToV infections appear to be subclinical [5], but there is a potential threat that a much more serious outcome will appear in concurrent infections with other enteric pathogens. the paper: LZ.
