{"summary": "multicellular organisms such as mammalians have evolved sophisticated and complex mechanisms to make themselves immune to invasion by a huge number of opportunists they encounter on a daily basis. for survival, these microorganisms have had to develop strategies to at least suppress their prospective host\u2019s defensive mechanisms. brucellosis is a cause of huge economic losses worldwide. it is known that factors from the bacteria either directly, by changing the BCV properties, or indirectly, by controlling and changing the expression of various host factors, help the intracellular pathogen survive within the host cells. it is expected that this difference should maintain the factors that help the pathogenic strain survive within the host cells. previous research works show that Brucella and Mycobacterium survive within macro-phages by limiting the fusion of lysosomes with the phagosomes harboring the bacteria. for therapeutic purposes it would be interesting to verify whether, regardless of pathogen type, common pathways may be triggered by these intracellular pathogens. THP-1 cells were maintained and cultured in RPMI 1640 (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 M 2-mercaptoethanol, 5 M L-glutamine and 100 IU/100 g/ml penicillin/streptomycin. the cells were split before the cell number reached 1 106/ml. the bacteria (B. melitensis) were grown to late logarithmic phase (OD600 = 1) in tryptic Soy Broth (Merck, Germany), centrifuged at 12000 RPM for 10 min and resuspended in warm RPMI 1640 without antibiotic. the cells were gently washed thrice with complete RMPI containing 100 g/ml gentamicin followed by 2 h of incubation in the same medium to kill extra 300 ng RNA with 25 picomole oligodT and 50 picomole random hexamer in 10 L final volume was reverse transcribed. the cDNA product was diluted one in half and transferred to -20\u00b0C in aliquots until used. all primer pairs were designed to have similar melting temperatures. quantitative PCR was conducted on a miniopticon instrument (BioRad, USA) using the SYBR Premix Ex Taq II. qPCR cycling conditions were as follows: 30 s pre-incubation at 95\u00b0C, 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C/5 s and 58\u00b0C/30 s. qPCR data for EMP2, ST8SIA4, HCP5 and FRMD5 showed that these genes are significantly dysregulated upon THP-1 infection with B. melitensis. compared to uninfected cells, three of them were significantly upregulated while one gene was significantly downregulated. several of the genes that had earlier shown their downregulation by RNAi suppressed the progress of the infection were indeed upregulated in the infected cells. this implys that M. tuberculosis induces changes in the host\u2019s transcriptome in favour of its survival and replication. we chose B. melitensis with similar life cycle to that of Mycobacterium. this gene is upregulated in THP-1 cells infected with B. melitensis. it is a member of the GAS3/PMP22 subfamily that is involved in the delivery of certain proteins such as integrin isoform. es infected with Mycobacterium and activated with INF show enhanced killing activity. INF stimulation of cells results in downregulation of EMP2 expression. ST8SIA4 encodes for a protein involved in the synthesis of polysialic acid. our data show that HCP5 gene is upregulated in THP-1 cells infected with B. melitensis. some genomic variations in this locus have been associated with viral load in HIV infection. FRMD5 shares 51% identity with another family member, i.e. FRMD3 (Susana et al., 2013 ). if a similar pro-apoptotic function could be attributed to FRMD5, the notion that infection of human monocytes with B. suis inhibits apoptosis can best be used to envision the interrelationship between bacterial infection, FRMD5 downregulation and apoptosis."}
