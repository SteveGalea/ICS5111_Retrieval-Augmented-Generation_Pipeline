{"summary": "y2H is based on the fact that many sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs) increase the rate of transcription of target genes by binding to cis-acting regulatoring elements (CREs) and activating RNA-polymerase (Pol) II at the corresponding promoters. a functional TF can be reconstituted by bringing DB and AD into close physical proximity. a few growing yeast colonies can be identified on plates lacking the corresponding amino acid. such positive selections have been used to identify a great number of specific protein\u2013protein interactions by screening of cDNA libraries. conceptually, protein\u2013protein interactions can also be inhibited by the use of cis-acting mutations in one partner. y2H and RY2H generate a huge quantity of positive clones. each positive clone is sequenced and the user gets the results back in one or several fast-all sequence files. the sequencing product contains part of the cloning vector and a specific primer tag. conventional sequencing only works well for up to roughly 500\u2013800 base pairs (bp) 2HybridTools is a handy software which simplifies and speeds up these steps by opening several sequencing FASTA files at the same time. it does not support multiple sequences, neither assembly of sequencing products using forward and reverse sequencing. a commercial suite does exist (DNADynamo), but it does not support multiple sequences. 2HybridTools requires BioJava (Holland et al., 2008) 1.5. the application is entirely open source. Binaries and example files for Y2H as well as RY2H can be obtained freely at GitHub under https://github.com/pc297/2HybridTools. gene sequences are translated into proteins which are aligned. overlapping sequences are then displayed in comparison to sequence model. a File menu allows saving open reading frame analysis, fragment overlapping. this option allows choosing the number of bases in which the protein is in frame downstream of the vector sequence. however, all bases prior to the start of the protein sequence are discarded. this is achieved by catching a StringIndexOutOfBounds exception when not returning the index of a vector tag sequence. ORF and strand are user-defined except in the case of automatic ORF analysis in which these parameters are set up automatically. the result will be designated as X but will, however, not be treated as a mutation. overlap is found between two sequences with the specified minimum overlap. the resulting sequence will be labeled \"AD-TERM OVERLAPPED\" if a corresponding N-terminus is not found for a given C-terminus, the latter will be labeled \"TERM NON-OVERLAPPED\" only alignment scores greater than the specified or default alignment score, which corresponds to 5 model sequence length 80%, are kept. results are then summarized above the sequence of reference with the precise mutation nature and counts and can be obtained by clicking the Graph button. CAP3 was not written specifically for the purpose of Y2H/RY2H analysis. 2HybridTools features vector-trimming and multiple sequence Blast. CAP3 does not implement protein translation, which renders protein Blast impossible and thus would incorrectly align a DNA sequence containing a deletion to a reference sequence. 2HybridTools is a portable Java application which requires BioJava 1.5. the application is entirely open source. Binaries and example files for Y2H as well as RY2H can be obtained freely at GitHub under https://github.com/pc297/2HybridTools. multiple sequence files can be loaded or appended to the current project. overlapping sequences are then displayed in comparison to sequence model. a File menu allows saving open reading frame analysis, fragment overlapping, translation, Blast and model alignment. this option allows choosing the number of bases in which the protein is in frame downstream of the vector sequence. however, all bases prior to the start of the protein sequence are discarded. this is achieved by catching a StringIndexOutOfBounds exception when not returning the index of a vector tag sequence. strand and ORF are user-defined except in the case of automatic ORF analysis. the result will be designated as X but will not be treated as a mutation. the minimum overlap is set to 6 amino acid residues or 18 bp. if a corresponding N-terminus is not found for a given C-terminus, the latter will be labeled \u201cTERM NON-OVERLAPPED\u201d. the sequence is then reverse-complemented from its vector tag onwards. we perform a Smith-Waterman alignment (by calling a SmithWaterman object from BioJava) with low substitution penalties and high insertion, deletion and gap penalties. only alignment scores greater than the specified or default alignment score, which corresponds to 5 model sequence length 80%, are kept. y program and one of the most widely used tool, can be used for the purpose of clone re-construction as it implements sequencing quality cut-off, clone identification using the latter. CAP3 was not written specifically for the purpose of Y2H/RY2H analysis. CAP3 does not implement protein translation, which renders protein Blast impossible. a yeast two-hybrid screening of the transcription factor SP1 was performed at the two-hybrid platform, CRCM (Inserm UMR891, Marseille, France) using a previously described protocol. the screen was performed using a human colon cDNA library, in order to discover potential new partners for SP1 involved in apoptosis. the proteins CDX1 and RPL23 were overrepresented in the sequencing results. interaction with RPL23 suggests that this interaction is cytoplasmic and could involve the synthesis or transport processes of the SP1 protein. we set the vector tag sequence as STHAS and the field \u201cDistance to ORF\u201d, the distance of the vector tag sequence, to the ORF as 6 amino acids (Vector/Define 5\u2032 Vector) since positive clones were sequenced from both ends, we also input a 3\u2032 vector tag sequence as DPAFL (Vector/Define 3\u2032 Vector), leaving the field Distance to ORF to 0 as the ORF ends directly upstream of this sequence (Fig. S3D, screen was performed at the two-hybrid platform, CRCM (Inserm UMR891, Marseille, France) using a previously described protocol. we read the resulting FASTA sequencing files into 2HybridTools using the File/Open Sequence(s) drop-down menu. interaction with RPL23 suggests that this interaction is cytoplasmic and could involve the synthesis or transport processes of the SP1 protein. we have also performed a RY2H screening using the SARS non-structural proteins (Nsp) Nsp10 and Nsp16. positive clones were sequenced from both ends. we also input a 3\u2032 vector tag sequence as DPAFL (Vector/Define 5\u2032 Vector), leaving the field Distance to ORF to 0 as the ORF ends directly upstream of this sequence. we then hit the Go button in the main interface. 2HybridTools is also platform-independent and thus easily accessible to Y2H/RY2H end-users. the ability to identify specific mutations from RY2H also provides the basis for focused study of interaction residues. a further development to this software would entail the use of NGS sequencing results. optional sorting of Blast! output in 2HybridTools. drop down menu showing (A) file options, (B) vector options, mismatches and (C) overlap options.
