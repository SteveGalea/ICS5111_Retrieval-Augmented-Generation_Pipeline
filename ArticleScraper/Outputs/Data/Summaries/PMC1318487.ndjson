{"summary": "human respiratory disease associated with influenza A subtype H5N1 has been documented in Hong Kong, and more recently in Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia. compared with human influenza virus subtype H1N1, the H5N1 viruses in 1997 were more potent inducers of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. tumor necrosis factor-a) and chemokines (e.g. IP-10) from primary human macrophages in vitro. H5N1/97 and H5N1/04 subtype influenza A viruses are more potent inducers of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in primary human respiratory epithelial cells than subtype H1N1 virus. we suggest this hyper-induction of cytokines may be relevant to the pathogenesis of human H5N1 disease. influenza virus infection of human macrophages and porcine alveolar macrophages has been shown to result in induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines. compared to human H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses, infection of H5N1/97-like viruses leads to hyper-induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines in human primary macrophage cultures in vitro. human influenza A viruses have been reported to induce interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 8 (IL-8) and RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted) in vitro from the transformed bronchial epithelial cell line (NCI-H292). cytokine profiles induced by H5N1/97 and H1N1 viruses in respiratory epithelial cells. primary human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) were grown according to suppliers instructions in serum-free and hormone supplemented bronchial epithelial growth media. cells reached confluency in approximately 9 to 10 days, and nearly confluent cells were subcultured using trypsin/EDTA (Cambrex) at a ratio of 1:5. human type II pneumocytes were isolated using a modified method. the tissue was digested twice for 15 min at 37\u00b0C in a shaking water-bath. the tissue was digested using a combination of trypsin and elastase. coll density gradient was collected and centrifuged at 25 g for 20 min. the cell suspension was incubated with magnetic beads coated with anti-CD-14 antibodies. the cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere (5% CO2, 37\u00b0C) ultra-thin sections (80 nm) mounted on copper grids were electron contrasted with uranyl acetate (1.5 hours, 30\u00b0C, Electron Microscopy Sciences) and lead citrate (40 minutes, 20\u00b0C, Electron Microscopy Sciences) each cell preparation was also stained with antibody specific for monocyte/macrophage surface antigen (CD14 conjugated with FITC, MCA2185F; Serotec). cDNA was synthesized from mRNA with poly(dT) primers and superscript II reverse transcriptase. cDNA was synthesized from mRNA with poly(dT) primers and superscript II reverse transcriptase. the mRNA for IP-10, interferon beta, IL-6, RANTES and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha were quantitated using real-time RT-PCR. the oligonucleotide primers and methods used for real-time quantification of cytokines, viral matrix gene and the housekeeping gene product -actin mRNA have been described previously. primary human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) were grown according to suppliers instructions in serum-free and hormone supplemented bronchial epithelial growth media (BEGM) cells reached confluency in approximately 9 to 10 days, and nearly confluent cells were subcultured using trypsin/EDTA. human non-tumor lung tissue was isolated from 13 patients undergoing lung resection in Grantham Hospital, Hong Kong. the research protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the University of Hong Kong and Hospital Authority Hong Kong West Cluster. the tissue was digested using a combination of trypsin (0.5%, GIBCO BRL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) and elastase (2 units/ml, Worthington Biochemical Corporation, Lakewood, NJ, USA) the non-adherent cells were layered on a discontinuous Percoll density gradient (densities 1.089 and 1.040 g/ml) and centrifuged at 25 g for 20 min. the cell suspension was incubated with magnetic beads coated with anti-CD-14 antibodies at room temperature for 20 min under constant mixing. transmission electron microscopy Cells were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences), washed three times in phosphate buffered saline and serially dehydrated in acetone. semi-thin sections (1 m) were cut using an ultra-microtome (Reichert Ultracut S, Leica Aktiengesellscharft, Wien, Australia) with a diamond knife. freshly isolated cells were spun down on glass slides, air-dried, and stained for 20 min at room temperature. stain was prepared by dissolving 10 mg naphthol AS bi-phosphate (Sigma) in 40 l DMSO. slide was washed and counterstained in 1% methylene green (Sigma) for 30 seconds. Flow cytometry The expression of cell surface antigen was measured by staining purified type II pneumocytes with optimal dilution of rabbit anti-human surfactant protein-C (SP-C), followed by a fluorescein isothiocyanate. each cell preparation was also stained with antibody specific for monocyte/macrophage surface antigen. RNA was extracted from cells for analysis of cytokine gene expression. cDNA was synthesized from mRNA with poly(dT) primers and superscript II reverse transcriptase. quantified by real-time RT-PCR using real-time RT-PCR. alveolar epithelial cell supernatants were measured by a specific ELISA assay. samples were irradiated with ultraviolet light (CL-100 Ultra Violet Cross linker) for 15 min to inactivate any infectious virus before the ELISA assays were done. previous experiments had confirmed that the dose of ultraviolet light used did not affect cytokine concentration as measured by ELISA. human type II pneumocytes isolated were stained with anti-CD14 FITC-conjugated antibodies to check for any contaminant macrophage. the cells were scraped off the culture flask, fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde and embedded in Araldite resin. alveolar epithelial cells were infected with human influenza viruses. the infectious virus yield (log10TCID50/ml) was determined in aliquots of supernatant collected at various times. inactivation of the virus by ultraviolet irradiation prior to infection of the alveolar epithelial cells abolished cytokine induction. mRNA profile of cytokine

concentrations of cytokine and chemokine mRNA were normalized to those -actin mRNA in the corresponding samples. the H5N1/97 and H5N1/04 viruses differentially up-regulated the transcription of IP-10, interferon beta, RANTES and IL-6 to significantly higher levels than the human H1N1 virus. none of the viruses induced TNF alpha in these cells. mRNA concentrations of cytokine and chemokine mRNA were assayed 3 h and 6 h after infection with bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells. mRNA concentrations of cytokine and chemokine mRNA were normalized to those -actin mRNA in the samples. at 24 hours post infection, levels of IP-10 induced by H5N1/97 and both H5N1/04 viruses were comparable. however, at 6 hours post-infection, the recent H5N1/04 viruses 1194/04 and 3046/04 appeared to be even more potent at inducing IP-10 than H5N1/97 virus (p 0.05) RANTES protein secreted from bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells at 6 hours post infection was significantly higher than that induced the IP-10, Interleukin-6 and RANTES mRNA levels were assayed at 3 h and 6 h post infection. the results from bronchial epithelial cells represent the means and standard deviation of three independent experiments. the results from bronchial epithelial cells represent the means and standard deviation of three independent experiments (from the same donor) al epithelial cells represent the means and standard deviations of three independent experiments (from the same donor) the results from alveolar epithelial cells are based on experiments from six separate donors. the means and standard

purity. the contaminating cells were predominantly fibroblasts with monocyte/macrophage cells being less than 2%. alveolar epithelial cells that constitutively reside in the lung can be infected with avian and human influenza viruses in vitro. the cells were infected with influenza A subtypes H5N1 (483/97, 1194/04 and 3046/04) and H1N1 (54/98) at a MOI of 2 and the proportion of cells expressing influenza A virus protein was analyzed at 10 hours post-infection by immunofluorescent staining. the infectious virus yield (log10TCID50/ml) was determined in aliquots of supernatant collected at various times. data are the means and the standard errors of independent experiments from three separate donors. the mRNA of several cytokines and chemokines were quantified using quantitative RT-PCR

levels (p 0.001). these differences were not explained by a difference in proportion of cells infected as indicated by immunofluorescence for viral antigen or differences in virus titre. cytokine mRNA up-regulated from 3 hr post-infection onwards included IP-10, interferon beta and IL-6. RANTES mRNA was only up-regulated at 6 hr post-infection. identity of cells in culture as human bronchial epithelial cells confirmed. transmission electron micrographs of human bronchial epithelial cells in vitro at low (A) and high (B) magnification. the cells were scraped off the culture flask, fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde and embedded in Araldite resin. both H5N1/04 viruses significantly up-regulated MCP-1 and IL-8 to levels higher than H1N1 and H5N1/97 infected cells. mRNA concentrations of cytokine and chemokine mRNA were normalized to those -actin mRNA in the corresponding samples. we failed to detect any interferon-beta proteins secreted from the supernatants of bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells after influenza viruses infection. the limit of detection of the interferon-beta ELISA was high (250 pg/ml) IP-10, Interleukin-6 and RANTES production by primary human bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells infected with A/Hong Kong/483/97 (H5N1/97), A/Vietnam/1194/04, A/Vietnam/3046/04. culture supernatants from influenza virus-infected human respiratory epithelial cells collected at 3 h, 6 h and 24 h after infection. culture supernatants from influenza virus-infected human respiratory epithelial cells were tested for IP-10, interleukin-6 and RANTES. the IP-10, Interleukin-6 and RANTES mRNA levels were assayed at 3 h and 6 h post infection. the results from bronchial epithelial cells represent the means and standard deviation of three independent experiments (from the same donor) the results with 3046/04 (H5N1/04) were generally similar to 1194/04 (H5N1/04) with the exception that the levels of RANTES protein in type II pneumocytes was not significantly elevated when compared with H1N1 virus infected cells. our inability to detect any interferon-beta proteins in spite of marked induction of mRNA is probably related to the limited sensitivity of the interferon beta ELISA. studies on transformed bronchial epithelial cell line A549 previously demonstrated that toll-like receptor 3 (TLR-3) is involved in the influenza virus A initiated cytokine responses. it remains to be determined whether H5N1 viruses also act via TLR-3 signaling in primary human epithelial cells. chemokines such as IP-10 and MCP-1 mediate the inflammatory response by further recruitment of circulating leukocytes into the inflamed tissue. cytokines such as IL-1, TNF-alpha and IL-6 are hyper-induced in macrophages. the differential up-regulation of IL-6 expression in human epithelial cells and the cytokines induced by H5N1 viruses may contribute synergistically to the pathogenesis of human H5N1 disease. cytokine profiles of 1918 recombinant viruses are more potent than human H1N1 virus at inducing proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines from human primary alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells infected in vitro. previous findings showed that H5N1/97 viruses also hyper-induce cytokines from macrophages and that patients with H5N1 disease have high levels of IP-10 and other chemokines in the serum. the Research Fund for the Control of Infectious Diseases (RFCID 03040712) and the Small Project Funding. research grants to JSM Peiris from the Research Fund for the Control of Infectious Diseases (RFCID 01030172), the Research Grants Councils of Hong Kong (HKU 7459/03M) and The University of Hong Kong Research Achievement Award, 2005."}
