{"summary": "the study compares the kinetics of [18F]FDG and three other PET tracers with relevance for infection imaging. for clinical applications, [18F]FDG remains the first-choice PET tracer. positron emission tomography (PET) allows imaging of molecular uptake. drawback is the nonspecific uptake of [18F]FDG in metabolically active tissues. static imaging shows only the uptake at a given time interval. methionine is a naturally occurring essential amino acid. it can be labelled with the positron-emitter 11C to obtain the chemically identical PET tracer. a high uptake of [11C]methionine has been observed after acute myocardial infarction. osteomyelitis was induced in the right hind limb of juvenile pigs by intra-arterial injection of S. aureus (porcine strain S54F9). the injection was performed into the right femoral artery, allowing for selective infection of this hind limb. osteomyelitis was allowed to develop for one week, after which the pig was scanned and then euthanized. pigs number 1\u20134 had body weights of 39\u201342 kg (initial model) pigs number 5\u201311 had body weights of 19\u201323 kg (refined model) pigs number 1\u20134 had body weights of 39\u201342 kg (initial model) tracers and lesionsa have been studied in the [15O]water paper. in pig number 3, inoculation failed to produce infection. cTwo soft tissue lesions within the FOV (pig number 4) the PET scans at Aarhus included 11C-labelled tracers in pigs number 1\u201310 and [18F]FDG in pig number 11. at hus, the PET data were acquired on a biograph TruePoint 64 PET/CT scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) the scan field covered 21 cm in the axial direction and was positioned over the pelvic region and the hind limbs. for [68Ga]Ga-citrate, the animals were scanned for an additional 6 600 s. the static PET/CT scans have been described in previous papers [3\u20135] and will not be further discussed here. plasma samples were counted in a Packard Cobra gamma counter. an energy window from 400 to 1400 keV was used. no signs of interference between consecutively administered radionuclides were seen. function The blood plasma rather than full blood was considered to be the reference fluid for tracer delivery. the decay-corrected plasma sample data were used as the input function. metabolite products are not expected to be found in the blood. the measured input function can be biased by delay and dispersion effects due to the differences in distance between the blood sampling site (carotid artery) and the infection sites in the hind limbs. a delay can be determined by applying a series of possible delay-correction values, fitting the data with each value, and selecting the delay-correction resulting in the best fit [25]. tissue compartment model with irreversible uptake (irr2TCM) and 2TCM with reversible uptake (rev2TCM) the rate constants were fitted as K1 (unit mL/min/cm3 or mL/min/100 cm3), the ratio K1/k2 (unit mL/cm3), k3 (unit min1), and the ratio k3/k4 (no unit) the theoretical net uptake rate is K i = K 1 k 3 k 2 + k 3 for i r r 2 T C M. the net uptake rate may also be determined as the slope of a Patlak plot. dcf is the decay-correction factor, calculated from the radionuclide half-life and frame time interval. optimal weighting should be 1/2 = L/R for non-decay-corrected data. noise in the weighting factors can severely degrade parameter estimation. tracers used uncorrected input function and metabolite-corrected input function. k2 was fitted as ratio K1/k2 (corresponding to the distribution volume of the first compartment) k4 was fitted as ratio k3/k4 (corresponding to the binding potential BP if the first and second compartments are considered to represent unspecific and specific uptake, resp.) osteomyelitis was induced in the right hind limb of juvenile pigs. intra-arterial injection of S. aureus (porcine strain S54F9) was performed into the right femoral artery. the injection was performed into the right femoral artery. pigs number 5\u201311 had body weights of 19\u201323 kg (refined model) blood perfusion in the lesions in these pigs has been described previously [6], including 17 osteomyelitic (OM) lesions and 8 soft tissue (ST) lesions. other OM lesions were also found in pedal bones but were too small for robust volume of interest (VOI) drawing. bThe[15O]water paper presents an exhaustive list of the lesions studied. in pig number 3, inoculation failed to produce infection [3]. cTwo soft tissue lesions within the FOV (pig number 4) image reconstruction parameters were 6 iterations, 21 subsets, 336 336 matrix in 109 slices, voxel size 2 2 2 mm3 and a 2 mm Gaussian filter. the scan field covered 15 cm in the axial direction and was positioned over the pelvic region and the hind limbs. the 15 cm FOV at the Aalborg scanner (versus 21 cm FOV at the Aarhus scanner) was a limitation. the fixation device facilitated symmetric limb positioning and the avoidance of limb movement during the scan sessions. in the 40 kg pigs (pigs number 1\u20134), 37 blood samples were drawn per tracer. each 5 seconds for 1 minute (12 samples), at 70, 80, 90, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180, 210, 240, 270, and 300 seconds (12 samples) for [68Ga]Ga-citrate, blood samples were also drawn at 75, 90, 105, and 120 minutes (four samples) the ga-citrate complex quickly dissociates into Ga3+ and citrate3- within the blood, but the gallium ion attaches to transferrin. metabolite correction was performed for [11C]methionine and [11C]donepezil. a fractionated HPLC analysis was used to separate the metabolites from the parent tracer. applied this procedure for each tracer in each animal, using input function offsets from 60 s to +60 s in 1-second steps. using full FOV data ensures that the statistical noise is low. first, this focuses on the part where the input function changes fast and the delay therefore is important. physiologically, the 1TCM corresponds to the tracer entering and leaving the tissue with no binding or other specific uptake. the rev2TCM corresponds to uptake in the tissue followed by reversible binding (or reversible metabolism of the tracer) DV may be used as an indicator of the degree of long-term uptake. for the 1TCM and rev2TCM, the theoretical distribution volumes are D V = K 1 k 2 for 1 T C M. the weights are noise-free, at the cost of ignoring the statistical effects from variation in tracer concentration due to kinetics. kinetic modelling of PET data was reasonably robust against some misrepresentation of the variance in (noise-free) weighting, with only severe misrepresentation being a problem. the three models were compared with the corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc), which rewards a good fit but punishes the use of a model with many fitting parameters. for a given data set, AICc favours the model resulting in the lowest AICc value [34, 35] [11C]methionine and [11C]donepezil showed an unexpected tendency of slightly rising values after typically 20 minutes. possible reasons like unresolved background counts were investigated, but no sign of such problems was found. all individual corrections were numerically smaller than initial PET frame length (15 seconds). 3.3. Modelling The overall results for the different models are summarized in Table 2. the majority of fitted ratios k3/k4 were above 2 (median value 4 for all VOIs, 5 if restricted to infected side); overall k4 was considerably lower than k3. the values of K1 were overall very similar for irr2TCM and rev2TCM. [11C]methionine The AICc values favoured rev2TCM and sometimes favoured irr2TCM, but, from mean the and median values, rev2TCM was favoured. only a small difference was observed between using the uncorrected or the metabolite-corrected input function with the rev2TCM. model fits for [11C]donepezil in pig number 6 (same animal as in Figures 6 and 8) Using the uncorrected input function, even the model with the least parameters (rev2TCM) gives a good fit. the black squares represent infection foci and the grey circles represent the corresponding noninfected positions. the plots include both bone and soft tissue data. the data for [68Ga]Ga-citrate did not correlate with perfusion (R2 = 0.03). the difference was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). for [68Ga]Ga-citrate, the difference was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). for [18F]FDG and [68Ga]Ga-citrate, the difference was not statistically significant. the minor difference seen for [11C]donepezil was not significant (p > 0.05) for tracers showing reversible uptake: [11C]methionine (a) and [11C]donepezil (b). the line is the identity line (y = x). the line is the identity line (y = x). the curves correctly represent the activity concentration in the plasma. after metabolite correction, the curves decreased as expected. the scale of the vertical axis has been chosen to emphasize the curve tails. good fits with 1TCM, only slightly improved by 2TCM (irr or rev) for irr2TCM, the fit was improved over the uncorrected input function. irr2TCM has fewer parameters than rev2TCM. model fits for [68Ga]Ga-citrate in pig no. 1 using 1TCM (a), irr2TCM (b), and rev2TCM (c) models. red and blue: OM lesion in the distal femur and the corresponding noninfected tissue. only a small difference was observed between using the uncorrected or the metabolite-corrected input function with the rev2TCM. only the k3/k4 values differed markedly, being lower for the corrected than the uncorrected input function. further analysis of [11C]donepezil will be based on the 1TCM with a metabolite-corrected input function. model fits for [11C]donepezil in pig number 6 using 1TCM (a), irr2TCM (b), and rev2TCM (c) models. the model with the least parameters (rev2TCM) gives a good fit. the model with the least parameters (rev2TCM) gives a good fit. [68Ga]Ga-Citrate Overall, the AICc values indicated nearly equal quality of fits for irr2TCM and rev2TCM. further analysis will assume the simplest model: irr2TCM. model fits for [11C]donepezil in pig number 6 (same animal as in Figure 6), using uncorrected plasma data as the input function. Legend as in Figure 6. Fits with a metabolite-corrected input function were visually very similar. plotting K1 as a function of perfusion gives a measure of extraction. if the extraction fraction is independent of perfusion, the plot will show proportionality between K1 and perfusion. if the extraction fraction is independent of perfusion, the plot will show proportionality between K1 and perfusion. Irreversible Net Uptake Rate (Ki) for [18F]FDG and [68Ga]Ga-Citrate. good agreement was observed between Ki calculated from the Patlak plots and from the irr2TCM model. Figure 11 shows Ki as a function of plasma perfusion. the lack of agreement was due to the rev2TCM giving unrealistically high values in some cases (e.g., >100 mL/cm3) the slope of the Logan plot was used as a robust measure of DV. Figure 13 shows DV as a function of plasma perfusion. modelling of PET data is restricted by the length of the acquisition, the number of data points, and statistical noise. the efflux level from a compartment may be practically zero relative to the length of the PET acquisition. kinetic modelling of [18F]FDG uptake appears only to have been performed in lung studies. the correlation with perfusion seen for both first-pass uptake (Figure 10) and net uptake (Figure 11) indicates uptake of [18F]FDG to be more flow-limited than diffusion-limited. no literature is available on early imaging times of [67Ga]Ga-citrate SPECT. the porcine osteomyelitis model is a Ga3+ ion with chemical similarities to the Fe3+ ion. a different reason may be indicated by Figure 12: maybe the tracer is able to differentiate infected soft tissue from healthy tissue (despite the slow uptake rate) distribution volume (DV) for [11C]methionine was higher in the infected tissue than in the noninfected tissue. difference between infected and noninfected tissue appeared more clear for soft tissue than for bone. affinity of the M1 metabolite for AChE is almost as high as the affinity of donepezil for AChE; the M1 metabolite is radioactive when the parent tracer is [5-11C-methoxy]donepezil. meier-Davis et al. [47] also found the overall level of metabolites to be higher in the pigs. kinetic modelling of [18F]FDG appears only to have been performed in lung studies and in a single study of an acute viral infection [39] all of these studies focus on irreversible uptake models, generally the irr2TCM, although some lung studies included a separate reversible compartment. no literature is available on early imaging times of [67Ga]Ga-citrate SPECT. we found the uptake of 68Ga to be well described by the irr2TCM. however, first-pass uptake (K1) of 68Ga was small compared to that of the other tracers. a rat model found uptake in bone lesions in a rat model. the model represents haematogenous osteomyelitis without bone trauma. despite the slow uptake rate, the tracer is able to differentiate infected tissue from healthy tissue. the difference between infected and noninfected tissue could point to [11C]methionine having a role in infection imaging (regardless of the role of perfusion in causing the distinction) in line with the results from static imaging, the distinction between infected and noninfected tissue appeared more clear for soft tissue than for bone. meier-Davis et al. [47] also found the overall level of metabolites to be higher in the pigs. this species difference may explain why we found relatively fast metabolization of [11C]donepezil. the correlation with perfusion indicated that the tracer is mainly flow-limited. the difference between infected and noninfected sites appeared to be higher in soft tissue rather than bone lesions. imaging at 120 minutes p.i. appears a good compromise. [68Ga]Ga-citrate and [11C]donepezil were not useful for imaging of osteomyelitis. too few soft tissue data on [11C]donepezil were available to draw any conclusions."}
