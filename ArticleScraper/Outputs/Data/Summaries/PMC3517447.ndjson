{"summary": "trade includes live and dead wildlife of multiple species that are captured, poached, and sold for food, medicine, pets and trophies. vast illegal trade remains largely unmonitored and underground. a second study used wildlife trade market surveys to more accurately estimate the number of illegally traded animals. an automated, real-time, comprehensive, global system monitoring official and unofficial reports of illegal wildlife trade activity has not previously been put into practice. automated digital surveillance system was developed to monitor reports on illegally traded wildlife and wildlife products. the system collects reports based on the keyword search strings described below and uses text-mining algorithms to classify reports on the illegal wildlife trade by location and species. reports were gathered from around the world but were limited to English for this proof-of-concept development. the system is available at http://www.healthmap.org/wildlifetrade. the system capitalizes on news indexers that draw from over 50,000 possible web-based resources. the development and utilization of key search terms allows information on the global wildlife trade network to be monitored in near real-time. the time of illegal wildlife trade activity was not included in statistical analysis. each report collected was reviewed manually to ensure the most accurate information was displayed on the website. the analyst ensured that duplicate reports were hidden from display.

Tiger bone made into tonics to treat joint problems and lessen pain Bear bile for inflammation and infection Pangolin scales to reduce swelling Manta ray gills to remove toxins. CITES data showed that Elephas genera imports averaged 13,661 from 2008\u20132010. the Loxodonta genera averaged 89,523 from 2008\u20132010. it is a comprehensive digital surveillance system for aggregating, organizing, and displaying illegal wildlife trade reports. healthMap\u2019s wildlife trade site covers the illegal trade for all species of wildlife worldwide. the Tiger Tracker shows 13 tiger product seizures from 7 countries. the Tiger Tracker plots official data and flows of wildlife products seized upon entry into the united states. freeland allows the general public to contribute information on suspected wildlife trafficking in Southeast Asia. submissions to the healthMap wildlife trade site are later reviewed by trained staff. the system detected reports involving numerous species of concern including the near-threatened pangolin for its scales. a majority of emerging infectious diseases were caused by zoonotic pathogens. over 70% originated in wildlife, with the number of events increasing significantly over time. the trade contributes to the potential for increasing numbers of emerging diseases. underreporting is inherently limited by the clandestine nature of the activity. a wealthy country may have more resources than a less economically developed country. a lack of resources may prevent detection and reporting of illegally traded wildlife. the number of reports incorrectly categorized is likely minimal. previous literature has shown Asia to be a focal point of illegal wildlife trafficking. it would be beneficial to include non-English language reports from additional RSS feeds. the illegal wildlife trade continues to grow, and new challenges are consistently emerging. the illegal industry is worsened by urbanization and global development that commercializes subsistence hunting and fishing. surveillance of the illegal wildlife trade is necessary to protect biodiversity, prevent endangerment of species and control the introduction of infectious diseases."}
