{"summary": "zika virus (ZIKV) is a vector-borne virus belonging to the genus Flavivirus of the family Flaviviridae. it is responsible for congenital malformations and other neurological and ophthalmological disorders. the virus has been isolated from various mosquito species. ZIKV is a neurotropic virus with a wide tissue tropism [10,11,12], including reproductive tissues and organs. in males, it can infect testes, the prostate, and seminal vesicles [12,13], and in females it can infect vagina, uterus, vaginal epithelium, uterine fibroblasts, Hofbauer cells, trophoblasts, and endothelial cells from the some commonly used drugs, such as acetylsalicylic acid, are contraindicated in ZIKV-infected patients. they increase the risk of internal bleeding, and other arboviruses (dengue or chikungunya viruses) that can co-infect the patients may produce hemorrhages. current search for ZIKV antivirals is being conducted with different approaches. those searching for compounds directed to viral targets (direct-acting antivirals) and those targeting cellular components needed for the viral life cycle (host-directed antivirals) administration of therapeutic antibodies seems to be a potential strategy against ZIKV. the NS1 [34,35], an immuno-modulator, or the envelope glycoprotein [36,37,38] constitutes a major target for neutralizing antibodies, and could be also the target for virucidal compounds. this strategy can be directed to host factors implicated in infection, pathogenesis, and in the immune response, as it has been shown for DENV and the west Nile virus (WNV). this kind of approach could lead to the discovery of broad spectrum antivirals that could provide low cost but effective tools for the control of flaviviral threats. s of the Tyro3/Axl/Mer (TAM) family of receptor tyrosine kinases, T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain (TIM) and dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) are expressed in different neuronal and non-neuronal permissive cell types. these molecules are also receptors for other viruses, including flaviviruses such as DENV and R448 (an AXL kinase inhibitor) and MYD1 (an AXL decoy receptor) compromises, but do not abolish, ZIKV infection of glial cells. curcumin, a widely used food additive and herbal supplement, reduces ZIKV infection in cell culture inhibiting cell binding while maintaining viral RNA integrity. the viral genome is internalized through clathrin-mediated endocytosis. it is transported to the endosomes with the involvement of cellular actin and microtubules. it is released inside the cytoplasm by fusing the viral envelope with the membranes of the cellular endosomes. the acid endosomal pH triggers rapid conformational changes on viral envelope protein. anti-neoplastic and pro-apoptotic inhibitor of the Bcl-2 impairs ZIKV endocytic uptake by reducing the pH of the endosomal vesicles in cell culture. hematological and myeloid diseases have not produced satisfactory results in clinical trials. compounds that interfere with the endocytic pathway, such as dynasore, were either toxic for the cells used or did not show any anti-ZIKV activity. these contradictory results are probably explained by the different methodologies, cell types, and, to a lower extent, viral strains used to analyze the antiviral activities of the compounds. a series of new 2,8-bis(trifluoromethyl)quinoline and N-(2-(arylmethylimino)ethyl)-7-chloroquinolin-4-amine derivatives have been proved to inhibit ZIKV replication in vitro with a higher potency than chloroquine or mefloquine. niclosamide decreases ZIKV production, partially restores differentiation, and prevents apoptosis in human induced N iron salt ferric ammonium citrate (FAC) also inhibits ZIKV infection through inducing viral fusion and blocking endosomal viral release by promoting liposome aggregation and intracellular vesicle fusion. a natural compound isolated from the plant Aglaia foveolata exerts a significant inhibition of ZIKV replication in primary human hepatocytes. osomiasis, hirsutism, and some cancers, as well as diethylnorspermine (DENSpm) limit viral replication in BHK-21 cells. ER-membrane multiprotein complexes, such as oligosaccharyltransferase, have been reported to be critical host factors for flavivirus multiplication. rotavirus and norovirus gastroenteritis, chronic hepatitis B, chronic hepatitis C, and influenza also inhibit virus infection targeting a post-attachment step, most likely virus genome replication. emricasan, a pan-caspase inhibitor, restrains ZIKV-induced increases in caspase-3 activity. the need for specific host lipids for flavivirus replication and particle envelopment make lipid metabolism a potential target for an antiviral search [66,99] the need for specific host lipids for flavivirus replication and particle envelopment make lipid metabolism a potential target for an antiviral search. adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a master regulator of lipid metabolism. adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase is a master regulator of lipid metabolism. adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase is a master regulator of lipid metabolism. PF-06409577 or metformin reduced ZIKV infection by impairing viral replication [112,113] targeting lipid metabolism could provide therapeutic alternatives for the discovery of host-directed antivirals against ZIKV. two other inhibitors of IMPDH, merimepodib and mycophenolic acid (MPA) also inhibit ZIKV-RNA replication in different cell types, including Huh-7 cells, human cervical placental cells, and neural stem and primary amnion cells. azathioprine, another inhibitor of purine synthesis and immunosuppressant, impaired ZIKV replication in HeLa and JEG3 cells. 6-azauridine and finasteride have been shown to have anti-ZIKV activity by inhibiting viral entry and/or RNA synthesis. among them are antiparasitics such as ivermectin and pyrimethamine. antibiotics such as azithromycin that prevents infection, replication, and virus-mediated cell dead [55] hippeastrine hydrobromide (HH), an active component of traditional Chinese medicine, and amodiaquine dihydrochloride dihydrate (AQ) inhibit ZIKV infection of human pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical NPCs and in adult mouse brain in vivo. the first step of ZIKV infection is its binding to the cellular receptor (Figure 1). drug targeting attachment (1); entry (2); endosomal fusion (3); translation/transcription (3); replication (5) by affecting the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (5.1), the lipid metabolism (5.2), the pyrimidine and the purine biosynthesis (5.3); assembly or maturation of the virions (6); or innate immune response (7). curcumin, a widely used food additive and herbal supplement, reduces ZIKV infection in cell culture inhibiting cell binding while maintaining viral RNA integrity. suramin, an anti-parasitic that interferes with attachment to host cells and with virion biogenesis by affecting glycosylation and maturation. l, a broad-spectrum antiviral and immunomodulatory use for human influenza A and B infections, inhibits ZIKV multiplication in cell culture probably because it intercalates into membrane lipids leading to the inhibition of membrane fusion between virus particles and plasma membranes. Chlorpromazine, an antipsychotic drug that also inhibits clathrin-mediated endocytosis, reduced ZIKV infection, confirming the requirement for clathrin-mediated endo saliphenylhalamide (SaliPhe) targets vacuolar adenosine triphosphatase enzyme (ATPase) and blocks the acidification of endosomes. inhibits ZIKV multiplication in human retinal pigment epithelial cells [71] that are natural targets for ZIKV infection [12] similar results were found by Adcock et al. (2017) with SaliPhe using a different screening [73] a series of new 2,8-bis(trifluoromethyl)quinoline and N-(2-(arylmethylimino)ethyl)-7-chloroquinolin-4-amine derivatives have been proved to inhibit ZIKV replication in vitro with a higher potency than chloroquine or mefloquine. a series of new 2,8-bis(trifluoromethyl)quinoline and N-(2-(arylmethylimino) niclosamide decreases ZIKV production, partially restores differentiation, and prevents apoptosis in human induced NSCs. tenovin-1, which represses cell growth and induces apoptosis in cells expressing p53 by inhibiting the protein-deacetylating activities of SirT1 and SirT2. iron salt ferric ammonium citrate (FAC) also inhibits ZIKV infection through inducing endosomal Fusion Once ZIKV binds to the cell receptor, it is internalized through clathrin-mediated endocytosis and transported to the endosomes. the viral genome is released inside the cytoplasm by fusing the viral envelope with the membranes of the cellular endosomes, a process triggered by acidic pH inside them. the optimal pH for conformational rearrangements and viral fusion is 6.3\u20136.4. clathrin-mediated endocytosis confirms requirement for clathrin-mediated endocytosis of ZIKV. 25HC is increased in human embryonic cells and brain organoids. also reduces viremia and viral loads without affecting viral binding, but blocking internalization and suppressing viral and cell membrane fusion. similar results were found by Adcock et al. (2017) with SaliPhe using a different screening. however, other compounds that interfere with the endocytic pathway, such as dynasore, were either toxic for the cells used or did not show any anti-ZIKV activity. contradictory results are probably explained by the different methodologies, cell types, and, to a lower extent, viral strains used to analyze the antiviral activities of the compounds. a series of new 2,8-bis(trifluoromethyl)quinoline and N-(2-(arylmethylimino)ethyl)-7-chloroquinolin-4-amine derivatives have been proved to inhibit ZIKV replication in vitro with a higher potency than chloroquine or mefloquine. niclosamide, a category B antihelmintic drug approved by FDA, was capable of inhibiting ZIKV infection. -1 represses cell growth and induces apoptosis in cells expressing p53 by inhibiting the protein-deacetylating activities of SirT1 and SirT2. iron salt ferric ammonium citrate (FAC) also inhibits ZIKV infection through inducing viral fusion and blocking endosomal viral release. drugs targeting the polyamine biosynthetic pathway, such as difluoromethylornithine (DFMO or eflornithine), limit viral replication in BHK-21 cells. ER-membrane multiprotein complexes, such as the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex, have been reported to be critical host factors for flavivirus multiplication. emricasan, a pan-caspase inhibitor, restrains ZIKV-induced increases in caspase-3 activity. bortezomib, a dipeptide boronate proteasome inhibitor approved for treatment of multiple myeloma and influenza, also inhibits virus infection targeting a post-attachment step. cell non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma has also been described as a ZIKV inhibitor. different cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, such as (alphaS)-4-(Acetylamino)-alpha-methyl-N-(5-(1-methylethyl)-2-thiazolyl)benzeneacetamide, reduced ZIKV-infection and propagation. methyl nordihydroguaiaretic (M4N or terameprocol) inhibit the infection of ZIKV and WNV, likely by impairing viral replication. sphingolipid metabolism has been involved in flavivirus infection [66]. imipramine, an FDA-approved antidepressant, inhibits sphingolipid metabolism. adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a master regulator of lipid metabolism. its activation by PF-06409577 or metformin reduced ZIKV infection by impairing viral replication. targeting lipid metabolism could provide therapeutic alternatives for the discovery of host-directed antivirals against ZIKV. further studies have confirmed an inhibitory activity of ribavirin against ZIKV strains of different geographical origin in various types of cells. the drug was shown to abrogate viremia in ZIKV-infected mice [121], which lack type I IFN signaling. other authors have described that MPA have little effect on ZIKV replication and showed significant cell toxicity. several other compounds have been shown to have anti-ZIKV activity by inhibiting viral entry and/or RNA synthesis, although their mechanisms of action have not been fully elucidated. antiparasitics such as ivermectin (used mostly against worms infections) and pyrimethamine (a folic acid antagonist that inhibits the dihydrofolate reductase and thus, DNA and RNA synthesis), are being tested for benign prostatic hyperplasi nephrotic syndrome, and in organ transplants, is believed to lower the activity of T-cells. hippeastrine hydrobromide (HH) and amodiaquine dihydrochloride dihydrate inhibit ZIKV infection of human pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical NPCs. lipid metabolism a potential target for an antiviral search [66,99] two compounds that disturb the lipid metabolism inhibit the infection of ZIKV and WNV, likely by impairing viral replication, as did other structurally unrelated inhibitors of the SREBP pathway. the dependence on cholesterol for different processes during flavivirus infection also provides a suitable target for antiviral strategies. adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a master regulator of lipid metabolism. its activation by PF-06409577 or metformin reduced ZIKV infection by impairing viral replication. targeting lipid metabolism could provide therapeutic alternatives for the discovery of host-directed antivirals against ZIKV. the drug was shown to abrogate viremia in ZIKV-infected mice [121], which lack type I IFN signaling, are highly sensitive to ZIKV infection. other authors have described that MPA have little effect on ZIKV replication and showed significant cell toxicity. however, other authors have described that MPA have little effect on ZIKV replication and showed significant cell toxicity. other compounds have been shown to have anti-ZIKV activity by inhibiting viral entry and/or RNA synthesis. antiparasitics such as ivermectin and pyrimethamine have been shown to have anti-ZIKV activity by inhibiting viral entry. hippeastrine hydrobromide (HH), an active component of traditional Chinese medicine, and amodiaquine dihydrochloride dihydrate (AQ), an FDA-approved drug for treatment of malaria, inhibit ZIKV infection of human pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical NPCs and in adult mouse brain in vivo. there are compounds that can prevent undesirable effects of ZIKV infection. innate immunomodulation IFNs play a key role in the elimination of pathogens. they are release upon the activation of the innate immune response by infecting viruses. IFN-, IFN-, and IFITM3 impair early stages of ZIKV infection. the virus is capable of evading type I IFN responses by acting over the JAK/STAT signaling pathway [114,138,139,140], and that type I IFNs might be mediators of pregnancy complications. in any case, use of IFN against ZIKV should further studies. many of the already tested drugs are directed against viral structural and enzymatic proteins, including anticancer and anti-inflammatory molecules, antibiotics, and antiparasitics. many of the already tested drugs are directed against viral structural and enzymatic proteins, including anticancer and anti-inflammatory molecules."}
