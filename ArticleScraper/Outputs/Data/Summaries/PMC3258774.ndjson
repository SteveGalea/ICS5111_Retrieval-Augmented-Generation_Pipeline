{"summary": "study included 16 patients of different clinical subtypes of psoriasis. interleukin-18 gene expression analysis was performed using real time quantitative PCR. three biopsies were obtained from each patient. interleukin (IL)-18 induces low levels of IFN-, but in the presence of costimulants, IFN- production is greatly enhanced. IL-18 suppresses the production of IL-10 and does not induce the production of IL-1R. a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the promoter of the IL-18 gene is associated with the presence of psoriasis, but not atopic dermatitis. this suggests that the SNP is associated with the presence of psoriasis vulgaris, presumably by affecting the production of IL-18. three patients were hypertensive, 3 had psoriatic arthropathy, 1 had hepatitis C virus (HCV) with anaemia of chronic disorder type and 1 had diabetes mellitus with hypertension. a positive family history was encountered only in one case. only 5 of the studied patients were not affected by predisposing factors. patients receiving systemic methotrexate were subjected to monitoring liver blood tests monthly. eight patients with mild to moderate degrees of psoriasis were maintained on topical steroid creams and ointments in form of betamethasone dipropionate, twice daily. third psoriatic lesional skin biopsy was taken from all patients. each PCR reaction contained 1 of TaqMan universal PCR master mix. 50 nM to 900 nM of forward primer, 50 nM to 900 nM of reverse primer, 250 nM of TaqMan probe labelled with 6-carboxyfluorescein. gene expression was determined for each sample. RNA extraction and complementary (c)DNA synthesis Total RNA was extracted using QIA amp RNA extraction kit provided by QIAGEN worldwide companies. cDNAs were stored at \u201320\u00b0C until real-time quantitative PCR was performed. glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), a constitutively expressed housekeeping gene, was performed on all samples. all genes were subsequently normalized against GAPDH levels. range of PASI score in different types of psoriasis Type of psoriasis PASI score grades Mild* Moderate* Severe* Total (%) Plaque-type 3 2 1 6 (37.5) Erythrodermic 1 1 (6.3) Guttate 1 1 (6.3) Flexural 1 1 (6.3) Palmoplantar 2 2 (12.5) Plaque and gutt 2 2 (12.5) Plaque and p.p 1 1 (6.3) Plaque and 2675 IL-18 LB 16 3.24 5.63 0.17-22.70 0.4900 0.9050 4.9000 IL-18 LA 16 1.78 2.72 0.01-8.10 0.2750 0.4600b 1.5250 Patients on TS IL-18 NL 8 0.26 0.44 0.01-1.3 0.014 0.051c 0.337 IL-18 LB 8 1.59 2.1 0.17-6.4 0.2275 0.53 2.53 IL-18 LA 8 0.61 0.58 0.012-1.6 the IL-18 expression in the psoriatic skin lesions after treatment was significantly lower than lesional skin before treatment (p = 0.023) the highest expression level was noted in plaque and nails clinical subtype of psoriasis. a significant correlation was obtained between IL-18 expression levels in psoriatic lesions and severity of psoriasis expressed by PASI score (r = 0.72 and p = 0.001) and disease duration (r = 0.40 and p = 0.01) no significant correlation could be revealed between IL-18 expression levels in psoriatic lesions and patients\u2019 age, smoking state, predisposing factors or coexisting diseases. 0.745 7.26 IL-18NL \u2013 IL-18 in non-lesional skin, IL-18LB \u2013 IL-18 in lesional skin before treatment, IL-18LA \u2013 IL-18 in lesional skin after treatment, TS \u2013 topical steroids, MTX \u2013 methotrexate a significantly lower than lesional skin before treatment. the highest expression level was noted in plaque and nails clinical subtype of psoriasis. significantly lower IL-18 expression was detected in non-lesional skin than lesional skin before treatment (p = 0.012) and after treatment (p = 0.012) no statistical significance could be obtained when comparing the change of expression before and after topical treatment (p = 0.069) psoriasis patients showed significantly increased IL-18 expression in keratinocytes from non-lesional skin. this supports the concept of psoriasis as a T cell mediated autoimmune disease. mRNA expression levels in lesional psoriatic skin were reduced after 14 days. but the reduction became statistically significant only after 28 days. this is further supported by studies demonstrating a decrease of IL-18 levels. trinquet et al. [28] studied the influence of disease duration on gene expression profiles in psoriasis. they did not reveal any correlation between IL-10 expression levels and age. but, they did not find any correlation between IL-10 expression levels and age."}
