{"summary": "human alphaherpesvirus 1 (HHV-1) and human alphaherpesvirus 2 (HHV-2) are highly prevalent and are associated with cold sores and genital ulceration. HHV-1 is associated with chronic and recurrent ocular disease, characterized by conjunctivitis, corneal ulceration, and epithelial and stromal keratitis. raltegravir was approved by the fda in 2007 for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and functions as an integrase inhibitor (15) it specifically binds to an aspartic acid-aspartic acid-glutamic acid (DDE) motif located in the catalytic core domain of HIV integrase. the region targeted is structurally homologous to the RNase H domain of eukaryotic recombin raltegravir could also inhibit replication of HHV-1, but they mapped its activity to UL42, the DNA polymerase accessory factor, by sequencing a raltegravir-resistant HHV-1 strain (21). this suggests that raltegravir might be a useful drug for treatment of herpesvirus infection but that it may function differently. raltegravir targets multiple stages of the FeHV-1 life cycle. e function targeted both DNA replication initiation and late gene expression. RESULTS FeHV-1 did not develop raltegravir resistance in vitro. wild-type (F0) FeHV-1 was passaged for 15 passages in the presence of increasing concentrations of raltegravir (F15-Ralt), DMSO (F15-DMSO), or acyclovir (F15-Acyc) and plaque purified. drug susceptibility was assessed by infecting CRFK cells with the viruses at an MOI of 0.01 for 2 h. only 9 SNPs were detected in protein-coding genes. 6 conferring synonymous mutations and 3 conferring nonsynonymous mutations. all of these mutations have been previously identified in other FeHV-1 isolates. raltegravir-passaged (F15-Ralt) and acyclovir-passaged (F15-Acyc) viruses were sequenced on the Illumina platform. raltegravir partly inhibits viral DNA replication. raltegravir targeted a second stage of the virus replication cycle. we hypothesized that raltegravir targeted a second stage of the virus replication cycle. raltegravir does not inhibit FeHV-1 terminase activity. cells were infected with FeHV-1 at an MOI of 3 for 1 h, treated with raltegravir 1 h later, and processed for electron microscopy at 7 hpi. we observed no difference in the number of capsids with versus without DNA. however, we did observe a statistically significant reduction in the total number of cells with viral capsids in raltegravir-treated infected cell cultures. agarose gel electrophoresis was used to identify plasmid cleavage. raltegravir does not inhibit FeHV-1 terminase-mediated genome cleavage. raltegravir inhibits early stages of DNA replication. ICP8 is a multifunctional viral protein essential for viral replication. it is required for DNA replication as a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding protein. it also plays a separate role in the initiation of late gene expression. the inoculum was removed, the cells were rinsed with low-pH citrate buffer, and viral titers were determined by plaque assay on CRFK cells. raltegravir did not interfere with ICP8's ability to bind ssDNA. ICP8-bound and unbound probes were resolved by native PAGE electrophoresis. the percentage of shifted probe, normalized to the 0-M raltegravir samples, was calculated. cells were infected and treated with a high dose of phosphonoacetic acid (PAA) for 12 h. this results in the initiation of DNA replication, but not DNA elongation. raltegravir, both alone and in combination with CHX, did not affect genome replication. to determine the effects of raltegravir on late gene expression, we adopted a methodology similar to that used to define the effects of ICP8 on late gene expression. to this end, cells were infected at a high multiplicity of infection (MOI), treated with raltegravir, and collected at 6 hpi for quantitative reverse transcription (qRT)-PCR analysis. at this time point, we found that raltegravir had no effect or drove a slight up raltegravir-treated cells were treated with 200 g/ml PAA. gD protein expression was reduced upon raltegravir treatment. raltegravir also inhibited viral DNA replication. raltegravir also inhibited viral DNA replication. primary feline corneal epithelial cells (FCECs) were infected with FeHV-1 at an MOI of 10 and treated at the time of infection with 200 g/ml PAA. cells were collected at 6 hpi, RNA was isolated, and expression of select late genes relative to DMEM-treated controls was assessed. a standard, unbiased approach to identify targets of antiviral drugs is to select for drug resistance, deep sequence the resultant virus, and then identify mutations associated with the drug resistance. we used a similar methodology to select for a raltegravir-resistant FeHV-1 strain by culturing the virus in increasing concentrations of raltegravir for 15 passages. wild-type (F0) FeHV-1 was passaged for 15 passages in the presence of increasing concentrations of raltegravir (F15-Ralt), DMSO (F15-DMSO), or acyclovir (F15-Acyc) and plaque purified. drug susceptibility was assessed by infecting CRFK cells with the viruses at an MOI of 0.01 for 2 h. extended passage in the presence of raltegravir did not produce any nonsynonymous mutations, consistent with the absence of selection of a raltegravir-resistant virus. no mutations were identified in UL42, as had been described previously for raltegravir-resistant HHV-1 (21), or in the FeHV-1 terminase (UL15), as proposed for HHV-5 (18). raltegravir-passaged (F15-Ralt) and acyclovir-passaged (F15-Acyc) viruses were sequenced on the Illumina platform. the virus was aligned with the FeHV-1 strain C-27 reference genome (NC_013590.2). raltegravir partly inhibits viral DNA replication. CRFK cells were infected with FeHV-1 at an MOI of 0.01 for 2 h. the cells were rinsed with low-pH citrate buffer. raltegravir does not inhibit FeHV-1 terminase activity. we did observe a statistically significant reduction in the total number of cells with viral capsids in raltegravir-treated cell cultures compared to DMSO-treated infected cell cultures. raltegravir does not block terminase-mediated genome cleavage. raltegravir does not block terminase-mediated genome cleavage. raltegravir does not inhibit FeHV-1 terminase-mediated genome cleavage. raltegravir inhibits early stages of DNA replication. replication as a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding protein plays a role in the initiation of DNA replication in conjunction with the origin binding protein UL9 (36\u201340) it also plays a separate role in the initiation of late gene expression (41, 42) and is thought to be important for viral recombination (43). raltegravir did not interfere with ICP8's ability to bind ssDNA. we recombinantly expressed FeHV-1 ICP8. raltegravir does not block ICP8 ssDNA binding activity. the inoculum and PAA were removed and replaced with cell line medium containing no drugs. the cells were cultured for an additional 16 h, at which point they were processed for relative genome replication using qPCR. raltegravir, both alone and in combination with CHX, did not affect genome replication. this indicates that it must impact DNA replication at an early stage. raltegravir specifically downregulates late gene expression independently of DNA replication. cells were infected at a high multiplicity of infection (MOI), treated with raltegravir, and collected at 6 hpi for quantitative reverse transcription (qRT)-PCR analysis. at this time point, we found that raltegravir had no effect or drove a slight upregulation of the two early genes that we tested, including the gC and gD genes. we also observed a significant downregulation of 7 out of the 9 late genes that we assessed, including the fluorophore was fused to the C terminus of glycoprotein D (FeHV-1\u2013gD\u2013DsRed) (48) the virus was suitable for these experiments, as gD expression was downregulated by raltegravir, but not PAA, treatment. in contrast, gD protein was produced at approximately the same rate in PAA-treated infected cells and DMSO-treated control cells. cells were collected at 6 hpi, RNA was isolated, and expression of late genes relative to DMEM-treated controls was assessed by qRT-PCR. raltegravir was infected with gD\u2013DsRed at an MOI of 3. raltegravir targets the ICP8 protein of FeHV-1, similar to the hydrazide-based integrase inhibitor XZ45 (35). both ICP8 and HIV integrase belong to the DDE recombinase class of enzymes that coordinate divalent metal cations within an RNase H-like fold (18, 50) raltegravir specifically inhibited an early stage of DNA replication prior to processive DNA elongation mediated by the DNA polymerase and its accessory factor. this early-stage inhibition is due to raltegravir blocking the ability of ICP8 to either bind to or activate UL9 helicase activity. this result does not exclude the possibility that ICP8 impacts other proteins necessary for DNA replication initiation. alphaherpesvirus DNA replication may involve a recombination-dependent replication stage due to the presence of genome concatemers that form complex structures. it has been suggested that the strand invasion activity mediates the transition from theta form replication to rolling-circle DNA synthesis. raltegravir inhibited HHV-1 pUL15-C-mediated DNA cleavage. raltegravir inhibited HHV-1 replication without apparent effects on pUL15-C activity. raltegravir also inhibited HHV-1 pUL15-C activity. raltegravir could have impacted UL30 and/or UL12 function. but effects on the RNase H activity of UL30 and/or UL12 cannot be excluded. repurposing raltegravir to inhibit ICP8 may be a novel strategy to treat herpesvirus infections. a recombinant FH2CS FeHV-1 strain (FeHV-1\u2013gD\u2013DsRed) was used for all experiments. compared with the recombinant strain C-27 (64) for sequencing and drug susceptibility. three passages were performed in 500 M raltegravir, 160 M acyclovir, or DMSO. stocks of the 15th passage (F15) were prepared. drug resistance was evaluated by infecting confluent CRFK cells. a nanogram of DNA was quantified using a Qubit DNA HS assay kit. it was used for library preparation with a Nextera XT library prep kit. initial de novo assemblies, using SPAdes, did not produce full-length FeHV-1 genome sequences. confluent CRFK cells were infected with FeHV-1 at an MOI of 0.01 for 2 h. the inoculum was removed and replaced with cell line medium containing DMSO or 500 M raltegravir. lycine in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer; fixed in 2% OsO4 in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer in the dark for 1 h; then washed 3 times, for 5 min each time, in water. cells were dehydrated through a series of increasing ethanol concentrations (50%, 70%, 80%, and 90% for 15 min each and 100% for 20 min; 3 times) the bacteria were cultured overnight (approximately 16 h) at 15\u00b0C. then centrifuged at 5,800 g at 4\u00b0C for 30 min and resuspended in collection buffer. protein was desalted and concentrated using a centriprep centrifugal filter. andigested pET-20b(+) plasmids included as negative and positive controls. nuclease activity was terminated by addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 40 mM. Sf9 insect cells were transfected with recombinant bacmids using pFastBac1-FH2CS ICP8. the supernatant from the transfected cells was collected and designated the P1 stock. the P2 stock was then used to infect High Five (Trichoplusia ni) cells. buffer exchanged into water on a PD Minitrap G-25 column (GE Healthcare) buffer washed with wash buffer containing increasing concentrations of imidazole (0 to 400 mM) buffers containing ICP8 were combined and buffer exchanged into water on an Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter (50 kDa) unit (EMD Millipore) into ICP8 storage buffer. the percentage of probe that was shifted was determined using ImageJ (version 1.51k) and normalized to untreated controls. the inoculum and PAA were removed to release the cells. all viral sequences were designed to evaluate viral gene expression during a single-step infection. all viral sequences were designed based on the C-27 FeHV-1 strain. the cells were lysed with a QIAshredder column (Qiagen), the lysates were passed through a gDNA eliminator column to remove gDNA, and RNA was then isolated using an RNeasy Plus minikit (Qiagen). cDNA was synthesized using MMLV reverse transcriptase. data were statistically evaluated using GraphPad Prism version 6.04 for Windows. students t tests were used to compare 2 groups, and one-way ANOVA with a Tukey HSD post hoc test was used. all experiments were performed at least three times. as9 genome engineering to express DsRed Express 2 fused to the C-terminal end of glycoprotein D (48) all viral stocks were grown and their titers were determined on CRFK cells, as previously described (26). all viral stocks were grown and their titers were determined on CRFK cells. confluent CRFK cells were infected with 2 l of F0, F15-DMSO, F15-Ralt, or acyclovir-passaged (F15-Acyc) FeHV-1 at an MOI of 0.01 for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. the cultures were then rinsed with ice-cold, low-pH citrate buffer to reduce cell-associated virus. initial de novo assemblies did not produce full-length FeHV-1 genome sequences. reads were subsequently mapped to the FeHV-1 reference genome (NC_013590.2) with Geneious (version 10.2.2; Biomatters Ltd., Auckland, New Zealand) the inoculum was removed and replaced with cell line medium containing DMSO or 1,000 M raltegravir. the cells were harvested by scraping, pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in an equal amount of 3% agarose, and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. cells were infiltrated with 1:1 ethanol-LR white resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences), covered in resin, and incubated for 24 h at 65\u00b0C. sections were stained with 2% uranyl acetate for 5 min, followed by 2% lead citrate for 3 min, and 10 independent sections for each condition were photographed. lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 24,500 g at 4\u00b0C for 1 h. protein was desalted and concentrated using centriprep centrifugal filter. nuclease activity was assessed as previously described for HHV-1. the percentage of plasmid that was nicked or linearized was determined using ImageJ (version 1.51k) the full-length FeHV-1 strain FH2CS ICP8 gene was amplified. a 6His tag was added to the ICP8 N terminus. the supernatant from the transfected cells was collected and designated the P1 stock. this was used to infect new Sf9 cells to generate a P2 stock. the P2 stock was then used to infect high five (Trichoplusia ni) cells. unit (EMD Millipore) into ICP8 storage buffer consisting of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) adjusted to pH 7.4. single-stranded-DNA binding capacity was assessed similarly to a previously described protocol (67) the inoculum and PAA were removed to release the cells from PAA block and replaced with cell line medium containing no drugs. the cells were cultured for an additional 16 h, at which point they were collected. gDNA was isolated using a Qiagen blood and tissue kit.
