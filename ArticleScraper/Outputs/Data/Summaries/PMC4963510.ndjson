{"summary": "the 2009 H1N1 pandemic revealed the need for better diagnostic tests for influenza viruses. overlapping clinical presentations impede clinicians' ability to predict causative pathogens (whether bacterial or viral) and may lead to unnecessary antimicrobial use. filmArray RVP replaced the combination of other viral diagnostic methods for nasopharyngeal swab or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens in the NYP/WC microbiology laboratory. the current study sought to evaluate the clinical impact of a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of respiratory virus in patients 18 years old tested within 48 h of arrival at the hospital. clinicians were able to order any of the available tests, all of which were performed on site except for Luminex PCR (sent out) in season 1, clinicians could order a full-panel FilmArray, limited testing for influenza virus/RSV, or individual influenza virus or RSV FilmArray, which were available 24 h a day, 7 days a week. Prodesse PCR Rapid antigen testing and Prodesse PCR were the two most commonly used viral diagnostic tests in season 1 Luminex PCR Detection of 12 viruses (influenza A virus, influenza A H1 virus, influenza A H3 virus, influenza B virus, parainfluenza 1 virus, parainfluenza 2 virus, parainfluenza 3 virus, parainfluenza 3 virus, RSV, adenovirus, rhinovirus) data were reviewed retrospectively after patients were discharged from NYP/WC. data were collected from inpatient and outpatient electronic medical records (EMR) systems. data were entered into an open-source, password-protected electronic database. ancillary testing included radiologic testing, bronchoscopies, and types of abnormalities when present. ancillary testing included radiologic testing, bronchoscopies, and types of abnormalities when present. the full panel was revealed in the EMR to include results for all viruses. the turnaround time for negative rapid antigen tests followed by positive reflex Prodesse tests was defined as the time from specimen receipt in the laboratory. the time to discharge or admit was defined as the time of first entry to the ED. multivariate logistic and linear regression models were used to evaluate key outcomes among patients tested with FilmArray (season 2) relative to those tested using conventional methods (season 1). a P value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant. the available diagnostic tests for respiratory viruses during each influenza season are summarized in Table 1. patients excluded if they had a known positive test for a respiratory virus before being tested at NYP/WC or if their respiratory specimen was received more than 48 h after hospital arrival. all positive rapid antigen tests were reflexed to Prodesse PCR due to low sensitivity of rapid antigen test. infrequently performed in our laboratory Viral culture Detection of 8 viruses (influenza A virus, influenza B virus, parainfluenza 1 virus, parainfluenza 2 virus, parainfluenza 3 virus, parainfluenza 3 virus, human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, adenovirus, adenovirus) a rapid antigen test result was followed by positive reflex Prodesse testing. the decision to admit or discharge a patient before or after the test result became available was documented. a rapid antigen test result was followed by positive reflex Prodesse testing. the name of and indication for any antimicrobial administered during the hospital visit or prescribed on discharge for coverage of the acute respiratory or febrile episode were documented. data on antivirals used for respiratory viruses while in the hospital and on discharge were also captured. turnaround time was defined as the difference from the time of specimen receipt in the clinical microbiology laboratory to the time of result availability in the EMR. the duration of antimicrobial use was the time from administration of the first antimicrobial dose until administration of the last antimicrobial dose during the hospital stay. in influenza virus-positive patients, the time to oseltamivir was the time of specimen receipt in the microbiology laboratory until the first administration of the last antimicrobial dose. patients tested positive using the individual orders for filmArray PCR. the groups were generally comparable in demographics, illness severity, and laboratory parameters. patients in season 2 who had an order placed for an individual influenza virus were included in the \u201cnon-influenza virus\u201d group analysis.

metapneumovirus (19%) in season 2 (Table 3). the majority of patients had nasopharyngeal swab testing; in season 1, there were 3/198 (1.5%) patients with BAL fluid positive for respiratory viruses. no patients had a positive rapid antigen test followed by a negative Prodesse PCR. 73 were positive for influenza virus (60 were discordant, 13 concordant) and 5 were positive for RSV (4 were discordant and 1 was concordant) influenza patients tested by FilmArray had a trend toward higher discharge rates from the ED than the rapid antigen test group. this difference in discharge rates became more pronounced and significant when comparing the influenza patients tested by FilmArray to the influenza patients with discordant results in season 1. the most common reasons for admission for the patients tested on the wards were related to their acute respiratory illness. n (%) 101 (64) 31 (57) 0.39 18 (45) 32 (38) 0.43 Discharged from ED, n (%) 50 (50) 19 (61) 0.25 3 (17) 14 (44) 0.067 After

no statistically significant difference between the time of the viral test order and the start time for any antimicrobial (including a one-time order) between the two seasons (P = 0.70) or in the start time of a standing antimicrobial course (P = 0.94). the median duration of use of antimicrobials in influenza patients was 48.1 h in season 1 versus 23.7 h in season 2 (P = 0.24). there was no significant difference in the numbers of patients with bacterial coinfections between seasons 1 and 2: 29/198 (14.6%) versus 15/139 (10.8%), respectively (P = 0.70) the rates of antiviral treatment in patients with influenza were similar in seasons 1 and 2, with 61% of patients in both groups receiving at least 1 dose of oseltamivir. patients with influenza virus positive by FilmArray had a significantly lower LOS (P = 0.040), antimicrobial duration (P = 0.032), and number of chest radiographs (P = 0.005). all outcomes in multivariate analyses were adjusted for age, immunosuppressed status, asthma, and ICU admission. stay, duration of antimicrobial use, and time to anti-influenza treatment were analyzed using the natural log of data due to nonnormal distributions. the number of chest radiographs was analyzed using negative binomial regression. patients positive for non-influenza viruses who received antimicrobials, n = 96 of 119 due to logarithmic transformation. individual

non-influenza viruses were discharged from the ED before arrival on the ward. the most common reasons for admission for the patients tested on the wards were related to their acute respiratory

patients being discharged from the hospital before a positive influenza test result became available in the rapid antigen group. rates of antimicrobial use in the hospital were similar between groups in the influenza and non-influenza virus categories. in both seasons 1 and 2, 56% of patients testing positive for influenza virus received at least 1 antimicrobial dose in the hospital. the most common indications for antimicrobials were pneumonia (including empirical therapy), sepsis (including empirical therapy), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation/bronchitis. the rates of antiviral treatment in patients with influenza were similar in seasons 1 and 2, with 61% receiving at least 1 dose of oseltamivir or inhaled zanamivir in the hospital. the discordant subgroup with influenza in season 1 had a significantly longer median time to the first dose of an antiviral.

DISCUSSION We compared outcomes for adult patients with positive tests for respiratory viruses at a tertiary-care center. the median turnaround time was 1.4 h (comparable to the medians of 1.5 and 1.7 h in our study for influenza and non-influenza viruses, respectively) 44/97 (45%) of these patients had a positive test result available before ED discharge, compared to 13/19 (68%) of patients tested by FilmArray in our study. the cost-effectiveness of rapid multiplex PCR was $115,556 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) for children 3 to 36 months old and $228,000 per QALY for older children 3 to 18 years old. a major limitation of our study is the retrospective, nonrandomized design."}
