{"summary": "a sentinel surveillance project on the viral aetiology of acute respiratory infection was initiated in 2011. 4617 cases of respiratory infections were identified during 2011-2013. 45 were identified as adenovirus-positive from sporadic and outbreak cases of respiratory infection. HAdV-7, HAdV-4, HAdV-7, and HAdV-55 were co-circulating. intraspecies recombination was identified in strain BJ04 and BJ09. recombinants carrying penton base gene of HAdV-1 and hexon and fiber genes of HAdV-2 might be a novel type of HAdV worthy of further study. novel HAdV genotypes may arise from mutations or recombination among the different types of HAdVs. HAdV can cause a variety of clinical diseases such as acute respiratory disease [7], gastroenteritis [8], and keratoconjunctivitis [9]. viruses in species HAdV-B (HAdV-3, 7, 11, 14, 16, 21, 50, 55), species HAdV-C (HAdV-1, 2, 5, the only human material used in this study was throat swab specimens collected from cases with respiratory tract infection during the implementation of the surveillance project on viral aetiology of acute respiratory infection. written informed consent for the use of the clinical samples has been obtained from all patients involved in this study. the viral DNA was extracted from infected cells by using a QIAamp DNA mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) the primer pairs designed to amplify and sequence the penton base, hexon, and fiber gene sequences are listed in Table 1. penton-1R GGTGCTGGGTAGAGCGTATG 15,630\u201315,649 HAdV4-Penton-1F ATGTGGGACGATGAGGATTC 13,567\u201313,586 HAdV4-Penton-1R GTCAATGACGGCGTCCAC 15,608\u201315,625 HAdV7-Penton-1F GATGATAGCAGCGTGTTGGA 13,699\u201313,718 HAdV7 HAdV4-Hexon -2R AGAGGGCAACATTGGCATAG 19,545\u201319,791 HAdV4-Hexon -2R ACCGGCCGTATTGACGAT 19,334\u201319,353 HAdV4-Hexon -2R ACCGGCCGTATTGACGAT 21,138\u201321,155 HAdV7-Hexon -1R CTGAACAGCATCGTGGGTCT 18,219\u201318, GGTGTA 32,419\u201332,438 HAdV-4-Fiber-1F CTTCCCAGCTCTGGTACTGC 31,349\u201331,368 HAdV-7-Fiber-1F GAAATTTTCTCTCCCAGCAGCA 31,100\u201331,119 HAdV-7-Fiber-1R ATTGGCTCTCTGAAACTG 32,392\u201332,411 HAdV-55-Fiber-1R AGATTGGCTCT adenovirus-positive specimens were cultured and further analysed. the culture was used to inoculate fresh cells for up to 2 passages. the culture was used to inoculate fresh cells for up to 2 additional passages.

HAdV-3 strains from 2011 to 2013 also had the highest sequence similarity. HAdV-55 infections (2 cases) and HAdV-7 infections (4 of 6 cases) seemed led to patients of severe symptoms (pneumonia), while HAdV-3 and HAdV-4 infection caused minor symptoms (symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection or bronchitis), with only one HAdV-3 infection causing pneumonia. strains BJ04 and BJ09 were close to the sequences of the HAdV-1 strains in the GenBank database. strains BJ04 and BJ09 are a little more like HAdV-1 sequences. recombination was not found among any of the other strains of HAdV-2 available in the GenBank database. phylogenetic analysis of species HAdV-E strains (HAdV-3, 7, 55) collected in Beijing. the phylogenetic trees were generated by using the maximum-likelihood method. adenovirus isolates were obtained from sporadic and outbreak cases of respiratory infection. 21 adenovirus isolates were obtained from sporadic and outbreak cases. penton base, hexon, and fiber genes from virus isolates were successfully amplified.

HAdV-3 strains from 2011 to 2013 also had the highest sequence similarity. 9 representative HAdV strains were selected to deposit in the geneBank nucleotide sequence database. hexon base: hexon base: KM458622- KM458630; fiber: KM458622- KM458630; fiber: KM458622- KM458630; fiber: KM458622- KM458630; fiber: KM458622- KM458630; fiber: KM458622; gene sequences were used to analyse the relationship of species HAdV-C strains collected in Beijing. strains BJ04 and BJ09 were close to the sequences of the HAdV-1 strains in the GenBank database. strains BJ04 and BJ09 clustered with that of HAdV-2. penton base, hexon, and fiber gene sequences of 7 representative Beijing HAdV strains were aligned and analyzed with sequences identified in the mainland of China. sequences from other countries and regions exhibited the highest similarity between those sequences. the phylogenetic trees were generated by using the maximum-likelihood method with 1000 replicates. the HAdV-3 strain (GenBank accession number DQ099432) with blue triangle was used as an outgroup. penton base, hexon, and fiber gene sequences between HAdV-3, HAdV-4, HAdV-7 and HAdV-55 strains indicated significant conservation and stability of the sequences within the genome across time and space. the genome stability of HAdV-3, 4, and 7 was also reported in earlier studies, showing that HAdV-3 has displayed a relatively stable genome for more than 50 years. two patients who were affected with HAdV-55 also appeared to have relatively severe symptoms (clinical diagnosis was pneumonia), highlighting the significance of HAdV-55 as being an increasing cause of respiratory illness especially pneumonia. efforts should be focused on a HAdV-55 vaccine because of its stable genome. the pathogenicity remains unclear and the virus has the potential to cause serious symptoms because of its infection of children below 1-year old. further studies will be required to elucidate the characteristics of this novel HAdV type."}
