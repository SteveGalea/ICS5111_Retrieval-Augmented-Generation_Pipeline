{"summary": "the nomenclature and taxonomy of CoVs have been revised by the Coronavirus Study Group of the international committee for taxonomy of Viruses. they are now classified into three genera, Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, and Gammacoronavirus, replacing the three traditional groups. novel CoVs, which represented a novel genus, Deltacoronavirus, have also been identified (4, 5) a total of 49 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection have been reported with 27 deaths (36), giving a crude fatality rate of 55%. a macaque model for MERS-CoV infection has also been established which showed that the virus caused localized-to-widespread pneumonia in all infected animals. the source of this novel CoV is still obscure, which has hindered public health and infection control strategies. mammalian cell lines, including primate, porcine, bat, and rabbit cells, may be explained by the use of the evolutionarily conserved dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) as its functional receptor (46, 47) these results suggested that MERS-CoV may possess broad species tropism and may have emerged from animals. studies on genetic diversity and evolution of lineage C betaCoVs in bats would be important. RNA was extracted from the respiratory and alimentary specimens using a QIAamp viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAgen, Hilden, Germany) the RNA was eluted in 50 l of AVE buffer (QIAgen) and was used as the template for reverse transcription-PCR. the PCR products were gel purified using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (QIAgen, Hilden, Germany) both strands of the PCR products were sequenced twice with an ABI Prism 3700 DNA Analyzer. sequences of the PCR products were compared with known sequences of the RdRp genes of CoVs in the GenBank database to identify lineage C betaCoVs. the heptad repeat regions were predicted by using the coiled-coil prediction program MultiCoil2 (55). the heptad repeat regions were predicted by using the coiled-coil prediction program MultiCoil2 (55) TGCAATAAAA-3\u2032 LPW3899 5\u2032-TCTCTTACTAATACATCGGCT-3\u2032 LPW3900 5\u2032-AAGACCTGACCATCTTCAGAAA-3\u2032 LPW3712 5\u2032-CTAGCGCTATAACTTCTAAAAGTA-3\u2032 LPW3712 5\u2032-CTAGCGCTATAACTTCTAAAAGTA-3\u2032 LPW3720 5\u2032-CTAGCGCTATAACTTCTAAAAGTA-3\u2032 AATTGTGTGAACTGTACTGAT-3\u2032 LPW3387 5\u2032-ATATATCTCGAAGTAACGATCAA-3\u2032 LPW3172 5\u2032-GTCCTCTGGCAACTTAATAAAGATT-3\u2032 LPW3130 5\u2032-CTAATATGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGA-3\u2032 LPW1507 5\u2032-GGTTGGGACTATCCTAAGTAAGATT-3\u2032 LPW1508 5\u2032-CCATCAT the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site, Ks, and the number of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site, Ka, were calculated using the Nei-Gojobori (Jukes-Cantor) method. positive selection for a site was considered statistically significant if the P value was 0.1 for the SLAC and FEL methods or the posterior probability was at the 90% level for the REL method. dRp sequence data of lineage C betaCoVs from European bats. one parametric model (Constant Size) and one nonparametric model (Bayesian Skyline with five groups) tree prior were used for the inference. analysis was performed using a relaxed clock model with Uced. Viral RNA was extracted from the respiratory and alimentary specimens using a QIAamp viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAgen, Hilden, Germany) the RNA was eluted in 50 l of AVE buffer (QIAgen) and was used as the template for reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) the mixtures were amplified in 60 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 1 min, 48\u00b0C for 1 min, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min. standard precautions were taken to avoid PCR contamination. sequences of the PCR products were compared with known sequences of the RdRp genes of CoVs in the GenBank database to identify lineage C betaCoVs. PCR products were assembled manually to produce the complete RdRp, S, and N gene sequences. phylogenetic trees were constructed using the maximum-likelihood method (51), with bootstrap values calculated from 100 trees. prediction of transmembrane domains was performed using coiled-coil prediction program MultiCoil2 (55).

Detection of positive selection in S genes. the S genes of Pi-BatCoV HKU5 possessed more positively selected sites than the S genes of Ty-BatCoV HKU4. the tMRCA of MERS-CoV, Ty-BatCoV HKU4 and Pi-BatCoV HKU5 was estimated at 1520.09 (HPDs, 745.73 to 1956.12) the tMRCA of MERS-CoV and three European bat CoV strains was estimated at 1859.32 (HPDs, 1636.67 to 1987.55) DISCUSSION In this study, Ty-BatCoV HKU4 and Pi-BatCoV HKU5 were found to be highly prevalent among lesser bamboo bat and Japanese pipistrelle in Hong Kong. the genetic distance between MERS-CoV and the various strains of MERS-CoV was still large, with their S proteins having 67.4% aa identity. nsp14 sequence shared 85.7% nucleotide and 95.5% amino acid identity with that of MERS-CoV (45) compared to 81.9% and 83.4% to 84.2% nucleotide and 88.6% and 92% amino acid identity differences between Ty-BatCoV and Pi-BatCoV. the divergent sequences of the S genes of Pi-BatCoV HKU5 may suggest that the virus has a better ability to generate variants to occupy new ecological niches. the divergent sequences of the S genes of Pi-BatCoV HKU5 may suggest that the virus has a better ability to generate variants. a much higher number of positively selected sites were observed in the S gene of Pi-BatCoV HKU5 than in that of Ty-BatCoV HKU4. this suggests that the S1 region of Pi-BatCoV HKU5 may have been under functional constraints in its host species, Japanese pipistrelle. partial sequences closely related to those of MERS-CoV detected in bats from Europe also originated from Pipstrellus bats (P. pipistrellus, P. nathusii, and P. pygmaeus) the difference between this BatCoV and MERS-CoV within the partial nsp14 sequence was also found to be mainly due to substitutions in the third nucleotide positions. roost in bamboo stems may reflect lower mutation rate observed in the S gene of Ty-BatCoV HKU4 and Pi-BatCoV HKU5, as well as other lineage C betaCoVs in bats, utilize the same receptor as MERS-CoV. this suggests these betaCoVs belonging to lineage C may utilize a receptor(s) different from those of other CoVs. bats harbor diverse CoVs, which is likely the result of their species diversity, roosting behavior, and migrating ability (16, 18, 29, 31, 32, 89) it remains to be ascertained if bats could also be the animal origin for the emergence of MERS-CoV either directly or via an intermediate host."}
