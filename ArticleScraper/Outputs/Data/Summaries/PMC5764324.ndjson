{"summary": "influenza virus is a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus belonging to the Orthomyxoviridae family. it has 8 genome segments that encode 10\u201312 different proteins. the virus is classified as types A, B and C. the development of antiviral drugs that target these factors can overcome the development of drug resistance that limits the use of current anti-influenza virus drugs. iCRT14 is an inhibitor of Wnt/-catenin signaling that disrupts the direct interaction between -catenin and TCF4/LEF1[13]. iCRT14 does not affect non-canonical Wnt signaling or other pathways such as Hedgehog, JAK/STAT or notch signaling. studies have documented the interaction of the Wnt/-catenin signaling pathway with viruses, including the human immunodeficiency virus. mice were pretreated with Wnt3a_CM and then infected with A/PR/8/34. increases in mRNA levels of HA, MP and NP in the lungs were also observed. influenza virus infection of HEK293 cells with A/PR/8/34 or A/WSN/33 increased the activities of the Wnt/-catenin signaling reporter. HEK 293 cells were co-transfected with a TOPflash reporter plasmid. the cells were normalized to pRL-TK Renilla luciferase activity. results of 4 independent experiments are displayed as mean SE. titers in the iCRT14-treated cells were significantly reduced at 48 h post-infection (hpi) compared to the control cells. similar results were observed with A/WSN/33 virus. iCRT14 had no effect on cell viability. culture medium was collected at various times post-infection. cell viability was measured using the CellTiter Glo kit (Promega) results of 3 independent experiments are displayed as the mean SE. iCRT14 significantly inhibited influenza viral proteins, NS1 and NP expression. iCRT14 acts at the early stages of viral infection at or before gene transcription. the cells were treated with iCRT14 (12.5 M) or vehicle control at various times before or after infection. the culture medium was collected 12 h post-infection. the results of 3 independent experiments are displayed as the mean SE. iCRT14 markedly reduced the levels of vRNA, cRNA and mRNA of all 8 segments of viral RNA, including polymerase basic 1 (PB1), polymerase basic 2 (PB2), polymerase acidic (PA), HA, NP, NA, MP and non-structural protein (NS) iCRT14 reduced the levels of vRNA, cRNA and mRNA of the NP gene in vero cells. results suggest that IFNs may not play a major role in the antiviral activity of iCRT14. iCRT14 reduces influenza virus infection in primary mouse alveolar epithelial cells. iCRT14 reduces influenza virus infection in primary mouse alveolar epithelial cells. mice were treated with iCRT14 at doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg or vehicle control daily for 9 days and sacrificed at day 10. iCRT14 partially protects mice from challenge with a lethal dose of influenza virus A/PR/8/34. the mice were challenged with influenza virus A/PR/8/34 (1,000 pfu/mouse) iCRT14 significantly reduced virus titers in the lung tissues at 5 days\u2019 post-infection. iCRT14 does not improve alveolar leakage, cell injury or inflammation. mice were infected with a sublethal dose of influenza virus A/PR/8/34. mice received either iCRT14 (50 mg/kg) or vehicle control daily. arrowheads in panels A, C, E, G represent major airway degeneration/necrosis, histiocytic and neutrophil infiltration. at day 2 post-infection iCRT14 equivocally reduced epithelium and loss of cilia in the lungs of animals that received iCRT14 treatment. mouse epithelial cells were pretreated with Wnt3a and then infected with influenza virus A/PR/8/34. the pretreatment with Wnt3a increased influenza virus titer in culture medium. increased mRNA levels of HA, MP and NP in the lungs were also observed. mouse epithelial E10 cells were pretreated with different concentrations of recombinant human Wnt3a protein for 24 h. the cells were infected with influenza virus A/PR/8/34 at an MOI of 0.1 for 18 h. results of 3 independent experiments are displayed as the mean SE. inhibition of Wnt/-catenin signaling reduces progency influenza virus production. iCRT14 inhibits Wnt/-catenin signaling by preventing binding of -catenin to the LEF/TCF transcription factor [13,19] was used in this study. iCRT14 reduces progeny influenza virus production. A549 cells were cotrasnfected with a pRL-TK normalization vector. iCRT14 reduces progeny influenza virus production. rat lung epithelial L2 cells were treated with adenoviral shRNA targeting -catenin (shCat) or a control vector (shCon) at an MOI of 100 for 48 h. the cells were then infected with A/PR/8/34 (MOI 0.01) for 48 h. iCRT14 reduces influenza virus RNA synthesis in the host cell. iCRT14 had no effect on virus titer when it was added at 7 or 9 hpi. iCRT14 reduces influenza virus RNA synthesis. the cells were treated with iCRT14 (12.5 M) 1 h prior to infection. RNA was extracted at 5 h post-infection. iCRT14 reduced levels of vRNA, cRNA and mRNA of all 8 segments of viral RNA. iCRT14 inhibits viral gene replication and transcription. interferons and antiviral activity of iCRT14 interferons are first line of defense against influenza virus. the cells were treated with iCRT14 (12.5 M) or vehicle control 1 h prior to infection. the cRNA, vRNA and mRNA levels of the NP gene were determined at 5 h post-infection. iCRT14 reduces influenza virus infection in primary mouse alveolar epithelial cells. mouse AECs were isolated and cultured for 6 days. iCRT14 reduces influenza virus infection in primary mouse alveolar epithelial cells. twenty-five mice were treated with iCRT14 (50 mg/kg body weight) one day prior to infection and daily thereafter until day 6 after infection. 0 mice survived, 5 mice died before reaching 30% body weight loss. 20 mice were euthanized according to criteria for euthanasia. iCRT14 attenuates the clinical signs associated with challenge with a sublethal dose of influenza virus A/PR/8/34. we challenged mice with a sublethal dose of A/PR/8/34 (100 pfu/mouse) and examined the resulting virus loads and lung pathology. body weight and animal survial were observed for 5 days. infection until day 2 or day 5 after infection. iCRT14 equivocally reduced epithelial degeneration/necrosis, histiocytic and neutrophil infiltration. at day 5 post-infection, there was decreased attenuation of epithelium and loss of cilia in the lungs of mice that received iCRT14 treatment. there was a subtle decrease in the severity of the lung lesions in the treatment group compared to the control group. iCRT14 acted at or before viral RNA synthesis. iCRT14 also showed a partial protective effect in a mouse model of influenza virus infection. Various host signaling pathways are altered during influenza virus infection. the current study demonstrates that the activation of Wnt/-catenin signaling enhances influenza virus replication. we showed that Wnt3a enhances viral gene expression in H1N1 A/PR/8/34- and A/WSN/33-infected human lung epithelial A549 cells. addition of Wnt3a or overexpression of -catenin and LEF1 inhibits H7N7 virus replication. discrepancy likely due to differences in strains used. mechanisms how Wnt/-catenin signaling regulates influenza virus infection are unclear. iCRT14 selectively snatches cell cycle-related cellular mRNAs. the nucleocapsid protein of Coronavirus is more mobile in proliferative cells. iCRT14 maintains its ability to inhibit influenza virus replication in IFN-deficient Vero cells. toxicity to organs, including lung, liver, kidney, brain, heart and eyes. iCRT14-treated mice showed less severe clinical signs at 5 days post infection. iCRT14 reduced virus loads and improved clinical signs. fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin and streptomycin (PS) were maintained in DMEM:F12K (1:1;
