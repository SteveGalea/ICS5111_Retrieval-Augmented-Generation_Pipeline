{"summary": "lectins are omnipresent proteins that are possibly there in all eukaryotic and numerous bacterial species as well as in several viruses. they are carbohydrate-binding proteins of non-immune temperament. they are extensively dispersed in nature and ample in plants. valis RCA Ricinus communis Agglutinin, Ricinus communis AIL Jacalin Artocarpus integrifolia VVL Hairy vetch lectin Vicia villosa WGA Wheat Germ agglutinin Triticum vulgaris SNA Elderberry lectin Sambucus nigra MAL Maackia amurensis leukoagglutinin Maackia amurensis the legume lectins are a family of carbohydrate binding lectins found in the seeds of plants belonging to the Fabacaea family. the accurate role of the legume lectins in vivo is unknown but they are perhaps implicated in the defense of plants against predators. application of lectin in the biomedical field are mitogenic activity on human lymphocytes, antifungal activity, and antimicrobial properties. the lectin from Moringa oleifera seeds show coagulant properties, antioxidant activity, and antimicrobial properties. concanavaline-A found to be the first lectin mitogen whose activity might be eagerly inhibited in a reversible way by low concentrations of simple sugars. a number of lectins have been accepted to have mitogenic activity, including Wistaria floribunda, Hura crepitans, Lathyrus sativus, Abrus precatorius. the defensive effect of ricin,51,52 Con A,53 and Griffonia simplicifolia lectin54 against tumor growth has been depicted. the shielding effect of ricin and abrin in humans against tumor growth and in grouping with anticancer drugs has also been illustrated. the chitin-binding lectins are projected to have a role in the plant's protection against fungi from stinging nettle (Urtica dioica) the plant lectins ease can be considered fungicidal proteins. plant lectins are persuasive inhibitors in vitro of animal and human viruses, which have glycoproteins in their virions. lectin inhibited syncytium formation in the HTLV and HIV-1. ula delica lectin73 are capable to inhibit HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. lectins are potential drugs for treatment of AIDS. some plant lectins may have an indirect antiviral role. the antibacterial activity of these lectins may provide an effective defense against invading microbes in the amphibian Bufo arenarum. the lectins from seeds of Canavalia brasiliensis, Dioclea grandiflora, D. rostrata, and Cratylia floribunda were shown to protect artificial seeds against the beetle callosobruchus maculatus. the first lectin has been reported to possess insecticidal activity was haemagglutinating lectin (PHA) the presence of PHA, the haemagglutinating lectin in the seeds protects the seeds of Phaseolus vulgaris from the attack of cowpea bruchid beetle. plant lectins may have antitumor and anticarcinogenic activities that could be beneficial in cancer treatment. some types of plant lectins have been identified which induce apoptosis activity in tumor cells. the fungal lectins exhibit antitumor activities, e.g., Volvariella volvacea against sarcoma cells. the lectin from Agrocybe aegerita exerts its effects via apoptosis induction and DNase activity. the quaternary structure of concanavaline A is having tetrameric form. it contains multiple binding sites, which play important role in the biological activities of plant lectins. the number of vander Waals and hydrogen bonding involve in the dimmers formation. lectins isolated from Sophora japonica, Calpumea aurea, and Dolichos biflorus show specificity to Blood group A and B and Lectin from Erythrina velutina seeds is A, B, and O blood group-specific. the earliest mitogenic activity of lectin was demonstrated in PHA from Phaseolus vulgaris. the ability to build up suppressor cell activity leading the conduct with Con A, in humans seems to be a variety of normal lymphoid cells. the production of suppressor cells is reduces in side-line blood lymphocytes of patients with immunodeficiency diseases. lectin mediated cytotoxicity may take place in vivo, by intraperitoneal injection of Griffonia simplicifolia. the precise identification concerning phagocytes and their targets can be consummate by using lectins on the surface of cell that unite with definite sugar on the surface of another cell resembling a lock and key model. source of lectin Fungal species inhibited Amaranthus viridis Botrytis cinerea, Fusarium oxysporum Astragalus mongholicus Borrytis cinerea, Colletrichum sp, Droschslara turia, Fusarium oxysporum Capparis spinosa. plant lectins exhibited anti-coronaviral activity in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. extra long autumn purple bean lectin72 and mushroom Russula delica lectin73 are capable to inhibit HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. lectins strongly interact with muramic acid, N-acetylmuramic acid, and muramyl dipeptide. the cell wall of bacteria can recognize the glycoconjugates and carbohydrate-binding proteins on their membrane. the many strains of E. histolytica express a surface lectin that are immunogenic. the seeds of leguminous plants are promising sources of primary metabolites, especially lectins and trypsin inhibitors. the plant lectins are the most potent agents against insect pests of variety of crops including wheat, rice, tobacco, and potatoes. lectin exhibited anti-insect activity toward the second instars larvae of B. cucurbitae. emergence of Helicoverpa armigera larvae into adults inhibited by Dioscorea batatas lectin by avidly binding to larval brush border and peritrophic membrane. the dark red kidney bean hemagglutinin exerted an antitumor activity toward leukemia L1210 cells. lectin has excellent antitumor activity that includes Banana lectin retarded proliferation of (L1210) cells and hepatoma (HepG2) cells. lectin is well-studied plant proteins that subsisted a significant prototype of evenness and variability of their binding regions. the high concentration of lectin causes toxicity, food poisoning and tissue damage."}
