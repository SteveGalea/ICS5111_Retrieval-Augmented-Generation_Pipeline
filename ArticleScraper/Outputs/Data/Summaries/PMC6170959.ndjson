{"summary": "plantar fascia (PF inflammation) is a flat band of ligament-like tissue that connects one\u2019s heel bone to toes. this tissue helps to sustain body weight and is subject to large mechanical loads during daily activities. it accounts for 11% to 15% of the foot symptoms requiring professional care among adults. adult stem cells from human anterior cruciate ligaments (ACL) and medial collateral ligaments (MCL) have been identified. mechanical overloading leads to tendon inflammation by inducing over-expression of cyclooxygenase (COX) and increased production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). PF may contain stem cells, which may also play a vital role in the development of plantar fasciitis. human PF tissue samples free of pathology were obtained from two adult donors of 39 and 44 years old. the protocol for obtaining PF tissue samples was approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board (IRB#: 14060471). stained tissue sections were examined under a light microscope (Nikon eclipse, TE2000-U, Nikon Instruments Inc., Melville, NY, USA) for immunohistochemical staining of CD31, CD34, collagen type I, and collagen type IV, sections were incubated with 0.05% trypsin at 37\u00b0C for 1 h for antigen retrieval treatment. sections were washed three times with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and re the proportion of positive staining was calculated by dividing the stained area by the view area. wet tissue samples (each about 200 mg) were digested in 1 mL of PBS containing 3 mg of collagenase type I and 4 mg of dispase. fixed cells were seeded in 12-well plates at a density of 3 104 cells/well. fixed cells were seeded with 0.1% of Triton X-100 for 30 min. fixed cells were treated with 0.1% of Triton X-100 for 30 min. PF-S and PF-C cells were seeded into 12-well plates at the density of 1 105/well. at day 3, cells were separately cultured with adipogenic differentiation medium (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA), chondrogenic medium (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) positively stained adipocytes were examined for red lipid droplets under a microscope. rocytes were fixed in chilled 70% ethanol for 1 h, rinsed with distilled water twice each for 5 min, and stained with Alizarin Red S (Millipore, Temecula, CA, USA) at room temperature for 30 min. stained mineral deposits in osteoblasts appeared orange-red. cells without stretching were used as control. media was collected to measure IL-6 and PGE2 production. total RNA of cells in each dish was extracted. type I, CD105, collagen type IV, LPL, collagen type II, Runx-2, MMP-1, and MMP-2 were synthesized by Invitrogen. at least three replicates were performed for each experimental condition. human tissue samples and ethics statement Human PF tissue samples free of pathology were obtained from two adult donors of 39 and 44 years old. the protocol for obtaining PF tissue samples was approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board. sections were washed three times with phosphate buffered saline for 1 h for antigen retrieval treatment. sections were then washed three times in PBS and incubated with 0.05% trypsin. staining results were analyzed by semi-quantification. wet tissue samples (each about 200 mg) were digested in 1 mL of PBS containing 3 mg of collagenase type I and 4 mg of dispase. cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, and stained with methyl violet for 30 min. fixed cells were treated with 0.1% of Triton X-100 for 30 min. fixed cells were treated with 0.1% of Triton X-100 for 30 min. fixed cells were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with either rabbit anti-human. PF-S and PF-C cells were seeded into 12-well plates at the density of 1 105/well and cultured with growth medium for 2 days. at day 3, cells were separately cultured with adipogenic differentiation medium (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA), chondrogenic medium (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and osteogenic medium (Life Technologies) for 21 days, changing media every 3 days. semi-quantification of positively stained cells was determined by a semi-quantitative method. the ratio of positive stained cells in total cells was calculated by dividing positive stained cell numbers by the H33342 positive stained cell number. qRT-PCR analysis RNA extraction was performed on PF-S and PF-C cells using the RNeasy Mini kit. a total of 100 ng of RNA (2 L cDNA solution) were amplified using the QIAGEN QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Kit (Qiagen) in a Chromo 4 Detector. at least three replicates were performed for each experimental condition. a p-value less than 0.05 was considered to be significantly different for RT-PCR results. human PF tissue consisted of two different types of tissues with different structures. one is the central part called \u201ccore\u201d (PF-C) and the other loose \u201csheath\u201d that surrounds the core (PF-S) horizontal sectioning showed distinct sheath and core parts (Figure 1(a), blue and yellow boxes, respectively) the core is a ligament-like tissue with well-organized collagen fiber bundles. the core is a ligament-like tissue with well-organized collagen fiber bundles. the core is a ligament-like tissue with well-organized collagen fiber bundles. enlarged images clearly showed sheath with a loose crosslinked network of collagen and the presence of blood vessels. enlarged images of core tissue showed well-organized collagen bundles. PF tissue contains distinct sheath and core tissues by staining for endothelial cell markers. semi-quantification shows significantly high staining for CD34 and CD31 in PF-S compared to PF-C cells. the expression of endothelial cell markers is much higher in the sheath compared to the core in human PF tissue. immunostaining experiments were used to analyze collagen content of each tissue type in human PF tissue. PF consists of two distinct types of tissue with different structural properties. enlarged image shows sheath tissue has crosslink network of collagen fibers negatively stained by collagen type I. semi-quantification shows significantly high collagen I in PF-C compared to PF-S and significantly high collagen IV in PF-S compared to PF-C cells (g). after 7 days in culture, PF-S cells exhibited faster growth and assumed a cobblestone shape. after 4 weeks in culture, PF-S cells produced larger colonies and higher cell numbers. PF-S cells grow faster and form larger colonies compared to PF-C cells. average colony size of PF-S cells is significantly greater than PF-C cells.

MMS does not alter the collagen I expression in PF-S stem cells. but there is significant increase in PF-C stem cells. IMS increased MMP-1 expression in both PF-S and PF-C cells. at IMS only, MMP-2 was significantly enhanced in both PF-S and PF-C cells. however, MMS did not change expression of non-ligament-related genes.

PF-S cells have twice the amount of IL-6 compared to PF-C cells (c) study characterized human PF tissue in detail at histological, cellular, and mechanobiological levels. PF tissue consists of two distinct sheath and core tissues with differential structural and compositional properties. the sheath tissue is a loose array of random, thin collagen fibers with blood vessels. PF-C cells are of ligament origin and their main function may be to maintain homeostasis of the tissue. PF-C cells maintain elongated shape in culture, similar to the shape observed in original tissue. PF-S cells are multi-shaped and associated with mesh-like structure of PF-S. collagen necrosis, angiofibroblastic hyperplasia, chondroid metaplasia, and matrix calcification are present in surgical biopsy PF specimens. intensive mechanical loading also induces the expression of MMP genes, increases COX-2 gene expression, and increases IL-6 and PGE2. this prediction by this study should be examined in future clinical studies of plantar fasciitis. human PF consists of two distinct types of tissues, sheath and core. these sheath and core stem cells exhibit different biological properties."}
