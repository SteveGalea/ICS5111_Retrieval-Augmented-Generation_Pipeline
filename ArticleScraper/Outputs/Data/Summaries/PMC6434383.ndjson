{"summary": "diabetes is often accompanied by the development of complications that affect most major organ systems (2). diabetes is often accompanied by the development of complications that affect most major organ systems (2). diabetes can cause long-term kidney disease and end-stage renal disease. all patients were diagnosed and treated for the first time. patients with other more severe diseases were excluded. blood samples from 48 healthy control patients included as a control group. qPCR reaction systems were prepared using SYBR\u00ae Green master mix. lncRNA PRINS forward, 5\u2032-TCCACATCCGGATTTACCTAAAC-3\u2032 and reverse, 5\u2032-CTGACGCACCCCTGACAGTCAG-3\u2032 and reverse, 5\u2032-AAGTGTTCAG-3\u2032 and reverse, 5\u2032-AGTACTTGCGCTCAGGAGGA-3\u2032. lipofectamine\u00ae 2000 reagent was mixed with expression vectors (10 nM) to form transfection reagent-vector complexes, prior to transfection. cells were transfected with transfection reagent-vector complexes at 37\u00b0C for 6 h. Western blot analysis Total protein was extracted from cells using xTractorTM buffer (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.) total protein was quantified using a bicinchoninic acid assay. patients Blood samples were collected from patients with diabetes, including patients without obvious complications (n=43), diabetic nephropathy (n=33), diabetic retinopathy (n=37), diabetic cardiomyopathy (n=29) and diabetic lung disease (n=38) all patients were diagnosed and treated for the first time. total RNA concentration was measured using a nanodropTM 2000 Spectrophotometer. RNA samples with a ratio of 1.8\u20132.0 were reverse transcribed into cDNA using SuperScript IV Reverse Transcriptase. qPCR reaction systems were prepared using SYBR\u00ae Green master mix. the PRINS cDNA fragment was obtained by PCR amplification and cloned into the pEGFPC3 vector. cells were transfected with transfection reagent-vector complexes at 37\u00b0C for 6 h. 10 l MTT (Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) was added to each well and incubated for a further 4 h at 37\u00b0C. protein bands were visualized using ECLTM Detection Reagent. all statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software. one-way analysis of variance followed by the least significant difference test was used to analyze comparisons among multiple groups. the current study was approved by the Ethics Committee at the Peace Hospital of Changzhi Medical College (Changzhi, China) all participants provided written informed consent. blood sample collection, RNA extraction and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) lncRNA PRINS and Smad7 mRNA expression levels were quantified using the 2Cq method (14) and normalized to the internal control -actin. cDNA fragment was obtained by PCR amplification and cloned into the pEGFPC3 vector. mouse podocoyte cells were collected and single-cell suspensions at a density of 4104 cells/ml were prepared using the MTT assay. cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 4103 cells/well and 30 mM D-glucose was added to each well. cells were incubated for a further 4 h at 37\u00b0C. the membranes were incubated with anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody for 2 h at room temperature. protein bands were visualized using ECLTM Detection Reagent. expression level of PRINS was significantly increased in patients with diabetes. expression level of Smad7 was detected by RT-qPCR in blood samples from patients with diabetes and healthy controls. expression level of Smad7 was significantly increased in patients with diabetic nephropathy compared with other diabetes-related complications. treatment with high glucose upregulated expression level of lncRNA PRINS. concentrations of 5 mM (control), 10, 20 and 30 mM D-glucose were used to treat mouse podocyte cells for 6, 12 and 18 h. LncRNA PRINS, long non-coding RNA psoriasis-susceptibility-related RNA gene induced by stress; Smad7, SMAD family member 7. overexpression of PRINS reduces cell viability and enhances expression of Smad7 protein in mouse podocytes. expression level of PRINS increases in patients with diabetes Differential gene expression indicates whether a specific gene is involved in a particular biological process or disease. expression level of PRINS was significantly increased in all patient groups compared with healthy controls. expression level of PRINS was significantly increased in patients with diabetic nephropathy compared with other diabetes-related complications. treatment with high glucose upregulates expression level of PRINS in mouse podocyte cells. concentrations of 5 mM (control), 10, 20 and 30 mM D-glucose were used to treat mouse podocyte cells for 6, 12 and 18 h. correlation analysis between serum levels of lncRNA PRINS and Smad7 mRNA in patients with diabetes. overexpression of PRINS reduces cell viability and enhances expression of Smad7 protein in mouse podocytes. mouse podocyte cell viability under 30 mM D-glucose was examined. relative expression level of PRINS was determined by western blot analysis. cell viability was examined by MTT assay in mouse podocyte cells following transfection with PRINS expression construct. expression level of PRINS was significantly increased in all patients compared with healthy controls. expression level of Smad7 increased in patients with diabetic nephropathy. expression level of Smad7 was significantly increased in patients with diabetes. no significant difference in expression level of Smad7 was observed in patients with diabetes with other diabetes-related complications. treatment with high glucose significantly upregulated expression level of PRINS. lncRNA PRINS, long non-coding RNA psoriasis-susceptibility-related RNA gene induced by stress. RNA psoriasis-susceptibility-related RNA gene induced by stress; Smad7, SMAD family member 7; RT-qPCR, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. overexpression of PRINS significantly enhanced the expression of Smad7 protein in mouse podocyte cells. treatment with high glucose can affect normal metabolism in patients with diabetes. expression patterns of lncRNAs can change depending on whether they accelerate or inhibit disease progression. upregulation of PRINS was observed following acute tubule damage in rat kidney transplantation (15). the current study showed that overexpression of PRINS decreased the viability of mouse podocyte cells, which are critical for renal function (22), and enhanced Smad7 protein expression. however, no correlation was observed in patients with diabetic nephropathy."}
