{"summary": "infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a single stranded, enveloped RNA virus. it causes infectious bronchitis (IB), a contagious disease associated with huge economic loses in poultry industry worldwide. emergence of variant IBV strains that differ in terms of tissue tropism, pathogenicity, and cross protection. a large binding groove of BF22101 MHCI molecule identified in B21 chicken line is thought to confer conformational flexibility to the crucial Arg9 residue. a large binding groove of BF22101 MHCI molecule identified in B21 chicken line is thought to confer conformational flexibility to the crucial Arg9 residue. this allows remodeling of key peptide-binding sites and play a role in the resistance against poultry viral infections. nucleotide sequences containing complete S1-gene of homologous to M41 and CR88 IBV strains were retrieved from NCBI database. the criteria used for the selection of M41 and CR88 were simply based on epidemiological relevance of the two strains. conservancy analysis was carried out using IEDB tools available at http://tools.immuneepitope.org/tools/conservancy/iedb_input [25]. proteasome and immune-proteasome were set at 5% threshold by MHC class I and only peptides with proteosomal cleavage site at the C terminus were considered. prediction criteria were set at 75% classifier specificity and 20 epitope lengths with an overlap. only epitope present at the surface of the membrane was selected and further analysed for antigenicity. conservancy analysis was carried out using IEDB tools available. the M41 IBV isolates were found to have an average nucleotides sequence length of 1614 (537 aa) while CR88 isolates had an average length of 1653 (553 aa). only YTSNETTDVTS175\u2013185 peptide was found to be antigenic. a total of six antigenic epitope peptides were predicted in CR88 IBV strains. however, three of these peptides were shown to be antigenic. conservancy analysis showed that the three CR88 associated antigenic B-cell peptides had 39.44%, 84.5%, and 43.66% conservancy rates. 15 of these peptides were found to be antigenic at various conservancy rates (98.82\u2013100%). most of the epitopes have conservancy rate ranging from 52.11% to 94.37% except peptide occurring at position S69. MHCI associated antigenic peptide predicted on the S1 glycoprotein of CR88 IBV strains. 86 M41 and 72 CR88 IBV isolates were considered in this study. a total of six antigenic epitope peptides were predicted in CR88 IBV strains. a total of six antigenic epitope peptides were predicted in CR88 IBV strains. epitope position Peptides Length Antigenicity S33\u201344 AFRPGPGWHL 10 0.1545 S54\u201369 NETNNAGSVSDCTAGT 16 0.4237 S83\u201392 MTVPPNGMSW 10 0.0306 S279\u2013290 VSNASPNSGGVD 12 0.7396 S328\u2013338 HPKCNFRPENI 11 1.9437 S405\u2013414 KSDGSRIQTR 10 0.3178 Peptides in italic represent LLLVTL 98.82 0.8935 19 TPLLLVTLL 9882 0.7935 176 VNNLTSVYL 98.82 0.6575 208 GGPITYKVM 100 1.3364 214 KVMREVKAL 80.00 0.4479 356 WFNSLSVSI 98.82 1.1016 387 AYSYGGPSL 49.41 0.9013 462 NVTDSAVSY 100 0.6936 465 DSAVSYNYL 100 a total of 21 MHCI peptides were predicted at different amino acid positions. 15 of these peptides were found to be antigenic at various conservancy rates (98.82\u2013100%). 18 MHCI epitope binding peptides were predicted. of these, 11 peptides were found to be antigenic. most of the epitopes have conservancy rate ranging from 52.11% to 94.37%. es responsible for virus neutralization have been mapped to be located within the first and third quarters of the linear S1 glycoprotein [13, 16]. predicted antigenic B-cell epitopes were found to be highly conserved and demonstrated strong transmembrane potentials. the regions through which B-cells and T-cell epitope were predicted in this study correspond to the IBV receptor binding domain (RBD) the regions through which B-cells and T-cell epitope were predicted correspond to the IBV receptor binding domain which play a role in sufficient binding as well as entry of IBV viruses."}
