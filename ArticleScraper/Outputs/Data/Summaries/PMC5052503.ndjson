{"summary": "study of the Function and Dysfunction of Saliva Saliva Formation Saliva is produced by three pairs of major glands and numerous minor salivary glands located in the oral cavity. the parotid, submandibular, and sublingual salivary glands contribute to 90% of total saliva secretions, while minor salivary glands contribute to the remaining 10%. ion is mainly controlled by the autonomous nervous system. parasympathetic stimulation produces abundant quantities of watery saliva. sympathetic stimulation produces more viscous saliva. salivary peroxidase has antibacterial, antiviral, and antiviral properties. histatins have been associated with antibacterial and antiviral properties. other enzymes could serve as indicators in diagnosis. the burning mouth syndrome is a set of painful and burning sensations in the mouth experienced even when clinical investigation of the mucosa proves to be normal. it is assumed that a large number of agents can be responsible for this condition. it is assumed that a large number of agents can be responsible for this condition. polypharmacy is the most common cause of xerostomia (complaint of dry mouth) and salivary glands hypofunction (objective evidence of reduced saliva flow rate) in the elderly. the most common types of medication with xerogenic potential are those with anticholinergic and sympathomimetic actions. SS patient has recurrent episodes of acute pseudomembranous candidiasis due to her extreme salivary gland hypofunction. the four most common questions are: Is the saliva flow rate too reduced, exaggerated or you can\u2019t discern a difference\" salivary levels of alcohol (ethanol), tobacco (nicotine, cotinine), cocaine, marijuana, opiate and methadone correspond well with their concentrations in serum. salivary biomarkers for diabetes, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, oral cancer, preterm labor and exposure to the coronovirus in severe acute respiratory syndrome have been the focus of several research activities in recent years. biofeedback is a therapeutic method that involves the amplification of a human biological signal. the biofeedback method allows both patient and therapist to observe subtle changes in internal activity. biofeedback training is aimed at reducing inappropriate psycho-physiological stimulation (i.e.: muscle inhibition)"}
