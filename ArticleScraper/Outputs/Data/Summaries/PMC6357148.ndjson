{"summary": "both viruses are members of the family Filoviridae of the order Mononegavirales. the genus Marburgvirus consists of a single species, Marburg marburgvirus. EBOV and MARV are responsible for some of the most devastating infectious diseases. there is currently no approved cure or commercially available vaccine for any filovirus. vesicular stomatitis virus-EBOV vaccine was approved for emergency use in Guinea in 2016 and the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2017\u20132018. phase III trial results showed an estimated efficiency of 100% when contacts and contacts-of-contacts were vaccinated as soon as possible. a monoclonal antibody cocktail, \u2018Zmapp\u2019, and a chimpanzee adenovirus-derived vaccine, \u2018cAd3-ZEBOV\u2019 are undergoing Phase the filovirus genome encodes the viral proteins NP, VP35, VP40, VP30, VP24, L and several forms of GP, each transcribed from monocistronic RNA. the individual genes are sequentially transcribed, resulting in more abundant transcription of genes located near the 3\u2019 terminus [12,13] viral proteins 35 (VP35), 40 (VP40), 30 (VP30), and 24 (VP24), the polymerase (L) and four glycoproteins (GP) each transcribed from monocistronic RNA. the GP gene encodes four products, three of which are generated by transcriptional stuttering at a centrally located polyuridine (poly-U) domain. nucleocapsids and GP1,2 are independently transported to the plasma membrane, nucleocapsids by hijacking endosomal sorting complexes. VP40 assembles into dimers and subsequently into hexamers as it moves towards the plasma membrane. replication occurs within the nucleocapsid complex and is catalysed by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity of the L polymerase. ocapsids are transported to the plasma membrane by hijacking endosomal sorting complexes. the major matrix protein, VP40, oligomerises as it moves towards the plasma membrane. the full length glycoprotein is sent to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and golgi apparatus (GA) filovirus genome encodes viral proteins NP, VP35, VP40, VP30, VP24, L and several forms of GP, each transcribed from monocistronic RNA. GP gene encodes four products through transcriptional stuttering at a centrally located polyuridine domain [14]. a 110 kDa secreted form of GP (sGP) that forms dimers via a unique C-terminal domain [14] and a 100 kDa secreted GP (ssGP) that is also dimeric [18,19] there is a 5 kDa secreted -peptide representing the C-terminal cleavage product of pre-sGP [11]. nucleocapsids are eventually released into the cell cytoplasm, requiring the cooperation of a number of factors. endosomal acidification also promotes removal of the GP1,2 glycan cap [22] by host cathepsins [23,24,25], subsequently exposing the receptor binding domain [26] that is required for binding to the critical intracellular receptor Niemann-Pick C1 [27]. VP40 assembles into dimers and then into hexamers as it moves towards the plasma membrane. the nucleocapsid, containing genomic RNA, is released into the host cell cytoplasm (2) and transcription of filovirus genes (3) and genome replication occurs. VP40, the filoviral major matrix protein, is the most abundant of the structural proteins. VP40 links the nucleocapsid to the cytoplasmic side of the cell membrane and facilitates the budding event that completes the viral replication cycle. the EBOV VP40 (eVP40) L-domain is unique, harbouring overlapping PTAP and PPxY motifs arranged as PTAPPEY. the PPxY motif, whilst not essential for VLP egress, improves budding efficiency by up to 70%. ubiquitin protein ligase (ITCH) and BCL2 associated athanogene 3 (Bag3) interact with the L-domain of eVP40 via their WW-domain. in so doing impact the efficiency of viral budding [48,49,50] through a number of different mechanisms. eVP40 Oligomerisation and Membrane Binding Motifs Localisation and attachment of VP40 to the plasma membrane is necessary for filovirus budding. ination [42] 10PP11 Ubiquitination [42] Y13 Ubiquitination [42] P53 Membrane localisation [57] A55 Dimerisation [51] H61 Dimerisation [51] W95 Oligomerisation [55] 96LPLGVA101 Membrane localisation and structural stability [62] P108 Dimerisation [51] 112TA113 Dimerisation [51] 116ML117 Dimerisation [51] F134 Oligo increasing levels of cholesterol in the plasma membrane positively affects MARV budding through mVP40 association. this effect is defined as increasing cholesterol levels in a lipid membrane, resulting in tighter packing of the phospholipid molecules. eVP40 is unable to localise to the plasma membrane of PSA-3, a CHO mutant cell line with approximately 30% less plasma membrane phosphatidylserine than is normally present [73] cationic patches of eVP40 monomers come together to form a larger cationic domain. mVP40 cationic patch is more extensive than that of eVP40. interactions with phosphatidylserine promotes eVP40 hexamerisation. interactions between PI(4,5)P2 and eVP40 are much weaker in the absence of phosphatidylserine. this supports evidence that prior interactions with phosphatidylserine are needed for subsequent PI(4,5)P2 binding. the details of this process of eVP40-lipid interaction, and membrane insertion and oligomerisation, remain unclear. tis virus (VSV) nor GPTACE protease-cleaved GP (GPTACE) affect EBOV budding. budding promotion by eNP requires the protein to be recruited to the plasma membrane by eVP40. mNP contains an N-terminal PTAP motif and a C-terminal PSAP motif. the ability of VP40 to form viral particles is dependent on its oligomerisation state, binding to the plasma membrane, and the presence of key internal motifs. VP40 Late Domain VP40 contains two distinct domains, a C-terminal membrane-binding domain and an N-terminal domain responsible for oligomerisation and budding. WW domains are unusually small, being composed of approximately 40 amino acids. these proline-rich motifs are named for their two conserved tryptophan (W) residues, which are separated by 20\u201322 amino acids. a wide range of proteins have been identified as containing WW domains. alanine mutagenesis studies have identified a proline at position 53 in the C-terminal domain that is essential for localisation of VP40. alanine mutagenesis studies have identified a proline at position 53 in the C-terminal domain that is essential for localisation of VP40 at the plasma membrane and subsequent budding from the cell.

EBOV hijacked host cytoskeleton to facilitate assembly and budding of their virions. ymerising drugs, cytochalasin-D and latrunculin-B, results in significant decreases in the number of VLPs and infectious viral particles that are released from the cell surface. overexpression of host promoters of filopodia assembly, cell division cycle 42 (Cdc42) and myosin 10 is associated with increased efficiency of MARV VLP budding. Nedd4 is most widely researched in the context of filovirus budding. the protein has a modular structure that is a characteristic of all Nedd4-like ubiquitin ligases. the protein has a membrane binding domain, four central WW domains and a C-terminus homologous to the E6-AP Carboxyl Terminus ubiquitin ligase domain. mutation of the HECT domain of Nedd4 enhances the budding efficiency of EBOV VLPs, possibly due to changes in Nedd4 protein conformation that allow for better access to the WW domain by eVP40 [95]. the same enhancing effect is not observed in the case of mVP40 [45]. knockdown of ITCH through the application of ITCH-specific siRNAs results in a 75\u201380% reduction in EBOV VLP egress. c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-mediated phosphorylation of ITCH is essential for its ligase function, with JNK1 interacting with ITCH at a region neighbouring the first WW domain. WWP1 contains four WW domains. all four are able to interact with the eVP40 PPxY motif. the WW1 is the most critical for the interaction with eVP40. ESCRT pathway drives the formation of vesicles, used in a metabolic context to sort proteins for transportation to various cellular locations. protein sorting is a highly complex and convoluted process, with cargo reaching its destination by one of several routes. ESCRT proteins that have been identified as being hijacked by filoviruses to drive the formation and release of viral particles. eVP40 can recruit Tsg101 from the endosomes to accrue at the plasma membrane at the site of eVP40 localisation. the eVP40-Tsg101 interaction is mediated through the vestigial E2 enzyme active site (UEV binding pocket) in Tsg101 [112], with mutations to PPxY and PTAP motifs yielding contradictory data. mVP40 does not possess a PTAP motif. mVP40 also interacts directly with the PSAP domain in the mNP. mVP40 reduces recruitment and incorporation of Tsg101 into viral particles by 20%. IQGAP1 trails behind nucleocapsids as they move towards the plasma membrane. the function of Tsg101 in this context is dependent on its interaction with VP40 in the case of EBOV, and VP40 in the case of MARV. deletion of eVP40 PTAPPPEY domain reduces VLP release by only 40% compared to wild-type eVP40. eVP40 enhances budding only when the PPxY domain of eVP40 is mutated. this enhancement is increased from 2\u20133 fold to 4\u20137 fold when the Alix Bro1-V fragment is used in place of the wild-type molecule. Vps4 is a type I AAA ATPase capable of dissociating class E vacuolar protein-sorting proteins from endosomes when assembled into a dodecameric complex by its cofactor. Vps4 is responsible for a 54% reduction in EBOV VLP budding compared to the wild-type control. calcium and the calcium-binding protein calmodulin are associated with the budding of HIV-1 and filoviruses. the presence of eVP40 and mVP40 promotes the accumulation of calcium in the intracellular space. egress is significantly enhanced by ionomycin, which recruits calcium into the cytoplasm from the extracellular environment and cytosolic stores. siRNA-mediated suppression of STIM1 in cells results in a 10-fold reduction in eVP40 VLP budding. single amino acid mutations to Orai1 subunits, and Orai1 inhibitors all negate increases in calcium cytoplasmic levels. budding is dependent on the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signalling pathway, with inhibitors of calmodulin significantly reducing the budding of both eVP40 and mVP40. the interaction between actin filopodia and mVP40 VLPs has been observed through immunofluorescence assays. mVP40-containing bodies and actin bundles co-localised in filopodia. this effect has also been observed through transmission electron microscopy of monolayers of MARV-infected cells. biquitin ligases are used by filoviruses to mono-ubiquitinate VP40. transport is mediated by the ESCRT pathway, discussed in section 3.3. it has not been clarified whether or not ubiquitin ligases use the L-domains as the site of ubiquitination of VP40. distinct WW domains facilitate the interaction of Nedd4 with eVP40 from different filoviruses. mVP40 binding most strongly with WW domain 1 and mVP40 with WW domain 3. mutation of the C2 domain of Nedd4 enhances the budding efficiency of EBOV VLPs. ITCH interacts with eVP40 PPxY exclusively through a highly specific interaction with its first WW domain. the interaction results in the mono-ubiquitination of eVP40 and enhancement of VLP egress by a factor of 2 to 3-fold. a selective inhibitor of JNK has been utilised to examine the relevance of JNK in the context of EBOV. the evidence that eVP40 interactions with ITCH influences eVP40 binding suggests that eVP40 binding does not interfere with the interaction of JNK to its WW domain 1-neighboring binding site. WWP1 contains four WW domains, and while all four are able to interact with the eVP40 PPxY motif, the WW1 is the most critical for the interaction with eVP40 [91]. SOCS3 ubiquitinates eVP40 and enhances the egress of both VLPs and infectious virions by a factor of 3\u20134 fold. eVP40 is mediated by the C-terminal SOCS-box domain of eGP. the protein has a modular structure, consisting of a membrane binding domain. study of Nedd4 found distinct WW domains facilitate interaction of Nedd4 with eVP40 from different filoviruses. mVP40 binding most strongly with eVP40 with WW domain 3 [45], suggesting that WW domain 3 is preferentially used, but not essential in this context. ubiquitin ligase is one of nine identified Nedd4-like E3 proteins. it is one of nine identified Nedd4-like E3 proteins demonstrating strongest binding to eVP40. ITCH interacts with eVP40 PPxY exclusively through a highly specific interaction with its first WW domain. a selective inhibitor of JNK, SP600125, has been utilised to examine the relevance of JNK in the context of EBOV. eVP40 binding does not interfere with the interaction of JNK to its WW domain 1-neighboring binding site. SOCS3 ubiquitinates eVP40 and enhances the egress of both VLPs and infectious virions by a factor of 3\u20134 fold. ESCRT pathway drives the formation of vesicles, used in a metabolic context to sort proteins for transportation to various cellular locations. ESCRT proteins that have been identified as being hijacked by filoviruses to drive their egress from the cell surface. a number of ESCRT proteins have been shown to be critical for efficient viral budding. eVP40 can alternatively recruit Tsg101 from the endosomes to accrue at the plasma membrane at the site of eVP40 localisation in order to facilitate budding. mutations to PTAP cause a budding defect of an equivalent magnitude to deletion of the entire eVP40 N-terminus [109]. this contradiction may be due to differences in the experimental design between these studies. mutations to PTAP cause a budding defect of an equivalent magnitude to deletion of the entire eVP40 N-terminus [109]. mNP localisation reduces recruitment and incorporation of Tsg101 into viral particles by 20%. Tsg101 co-localises with IQ motif containing GTPase activating protein 1 (IQGAP1). IQGAP1 trails behind nucleocapsids as they move towards the plasma membrane. Alix is well recognised as having a role in promoting the egress of other viruses, particularly in the context of HIV-1 budding [116]. Alix contains three domains: Bro1, V, and PRD, with the latter containing a PPxY motif. the YPx(n)L motif gives Alix the capability to rescue viral budding in the absence of a functional PPxY domain that interacts with Tsg101 [116]. a subsequent search for a motif in filoviruses that interact with Alix identified YPx(n)L/I in the VP40 N-terminus of all Ebolavirus strains except RESTV and TAFV [118]. Mutation of this YPx(n)L/I motif abrogates the enhancing effect of Bro1-V on EBOV VLP budding [118]. Vps4 is localised to endosomes in the absence of eVP40. in the presence of eVP40 it is re-localised to plasma membrane. eVP40 can recruit Tsg101 from endosomes to accrue at the plasma membrane. the eVP40 L-domain mediating this binding interaction has not been confirmed. mutations to PPxY and PPxY motifs of eVP40 are functionally redundant. this contradictory data may be due to differences in experimental design. mVP40 residues identified the PPxY motif as critical for interacting with Tsg101. localisation of Tsg101 does not occur in systems expressing Tsg101 and either mVP40 or mVP40. mVP40 co-expression is necessary for Tsg101 localisation to the plasma membrane. Alix ALG-2-interacting protein X (Alix), also known as AIP1, is an ESCRT-associated protein, which functions as a critical recruiter of ESCRT complexes and associated proteins. Alix is well recognised as having a role in promoting the egress of other viruses, particularly in the context of HIV-1 budding [116] eVP40 enhancement is increased from 2\u20133 fold to 4\u20137 fold when the PPxY domain of eVP40 is mutated. this enhancement may be as a result of conformational changes in Alix which occur when the proline-rich domain is removed. there has not been any data published on the effect of Alix on EBOV budding. Vps4 is a type I AAA ATPase capable of dissociating class E vacuolar protein-sorting proteins from endosomal membranes. Vps4 is localised to endosomes in the absence of eVP40, whereas in the presence of eVP40 it is re-localised to plasma membrane. intracellular calcium ion chelator 1,2-bis(2-amino-5-phenoxy)ethane-N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetraacetic acid was used to demonstrate that decreasing levels of free calcium significantly reduces EBOV VLP budding. egress is significantly enhanced by ionomycin, which recruits calcium into the cytoplasm from the extracellular environment and cytosolic stores. calcium is involved in a number of signalling pathways, which have been inhibited. budding is dependent on the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signalling pathway. inhibitors of calmodulin (W7, trifluoperazine and W13) and MEK (U0126) significantly reduced the budding of both eVP40 and mVP40. tetherin is a relatively non-polymorphic type II protein. it is composed of three structural domains: a transmembrane domain, a coiled-coil ectodomain, and a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. this protein was able to effectively tether HIV-1 virions in a manner homologous to human tetherin, indicating that structure, rather than sequence, is the critical factor eGP does not alter the localisation profile of tetherin by removing it from lipid rafts. deletion of either terminal domain prevents tetherin functioning. eGP is also capable of rescuing HIV particles from restriction by human tetherin [153], indicating that this protein is unusually diverse in its antagonism. eGP functions in the late stages of its maturation at the cell surface. mutations to the eGP transmembrane domain also negatively impacts on the ability of eGP to block tetherin function. eVP40-tetherin interactions are inhibited when eVP40 is co-expressed with eGP. evidence supports an interaction between ISG15 and Nedd4 rather than targeting of eVP40 itself, preventing Nedd4 from participating in normal interactions with eVP40. co-immunoprecipitation of cells with plasmids expressing Nedd4, ISG15 and eVP40 significantly decreases levels of free ISG15 when compared to cells expressing eVP40 alone. in-like protease (PLpro), and E3, respectively [161,162,163]. there are no reports of a viral antagonist that targets ISG15 to restore EBOV budding. however, the precedent set by Influenza B, SARS-CoV, and Vaccinia viruses makes it an intriguing possibility worthy of further investigation. a number of small quinoxaline-based molecules have been identified as targeting the PPxY domain. the presence of a conserved PPxY domain in a number of RNA viruses provides a target for a broad-spectrum antiviral drug. tetherin inhibits viral spread by tethering mature virions to the surface of host cells and to each other [135,136,137,138,139] at lipid raft domains at the plasma membrane. tetherin is a relatively non-polymorphic type II protein 141,142. tetherin monomers form parallel dimers during entrapment of HIV-1 particles. deletion of either terminal domain prevents tetherin functioning. eGP is also capable of rescuing HIV particles from restriction by human tetherin [153] eGP does not alter the localisation profile of tetherin by removing it from lipid rafts. eGP does not inhibit the incorporation of tetherin into virion envelope membranes. tetherin interacts exclusively with lower molecular mass forms of eGP. ISG15 is a broad-spectrum antiviral protein induced by type I IFN. the antiviral properties of ISG15 rely on a ubiquitination-like mechanism (ISGylation), which conjugates ISG15 to a target protein at lysine rich residues. evidence supports an interaction between ISG15 and Nedd4 rather than targeting of eVP40 itself. the presence of ISG15 inhibits interactions between Nedd4 and the E2 enzymes required to promote the ubiquitination function of Nedd4 [160] the potential interference of ISG15 on MARV budding has not been explored. there are no reports of a viral antagonist that targets ISG15 to restore EBOV budding. expression of Bag3 during VLP and virus budding significantly decreases the egress of both EBOV and MARV particles in a dose-dependent manner. preliminary evidence suggests that its function relies on a mechanism consistent with its homeostatic role in chaperone-based aggresome targeting and autophagy. human cell-permeable antibodies (transbodies) specific to eVP40 have been generated as a preliminary attempt at a cell-penetrable immune-based treatment agent. these transbodies effectively inhibited egress of EBOV VLPs [167]."}
