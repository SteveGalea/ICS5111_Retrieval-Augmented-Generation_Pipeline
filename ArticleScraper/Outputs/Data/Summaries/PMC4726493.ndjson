{"summary": "the virus has a 28 kb genome containing a 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR), a 3\u2032 UTR, and at least seven open reading frames (ORFs) the ORFs encode four structural proteins (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) and two polyproteins (1a and 1b), in the order of 5\u2032UTR\u2014ORF 1a/1b\u2014S\u2014ORF 3\u2014E\u2014M\u2014N\u20143 the PEDV strains detected in these countries were grouped as US-like PEDV strains based on phylogenetic analysis using whole-genome sequences. the high similarity of whole-genome sequences among these PEDV strains led to the hypothesis that the origin of these virulent strains may be common. 119 PEDV strains, including 36 japanese and 83 foreign PEDV strains, were used in this study. the origins of and the date of detection were summarized in S1 Table. sequence motif A motif is generally defined as a nucleotide sequence that has some biological significance, such as a binding site on a regulatory protein. to find motifs based on our definition, we developed an original motif mining program using R software version 3.1.1 (R Core Team (2014), Vienna, Austria) the presence of each combined motif was tested for all 119 PEDV strains. starting and ending sites for each motif were identified with reference to the whole genome sequence of the referential PEDV strain, Colorado/USA/2013. 119 PEDV strains, including 36 japanese and 83 foreign PEDV strains, were used in this study. the origins of and the date the pig illness was diagnosed at the farm as PED (for Japanese PEDV strain) or the date of detection (for foreign strains) are summarized in S1 Table. the process of identifying motifs is further detailed here. first, we removed identical sites among the 119 PEDV strains. then defined the remaining 1,071 sites as single nucleotide polymorphism sites (SNPs) this window was determined to be a candidate motif region. the first strain to have a particular motif was determined as the reference strain for each motif. starting and ending sites for each motif were identified with reference to the whole genome sequence of the referential PEDV strain, Colorado/USA/2013. sequence motifs identified within the genomes of 119 PEDV strains isolated from 2013\u20133014. the first isolated strain has the sequence motif. phylogenetic tree of whole genomes from all 119 PEDV strains shows presence of motifs in each strain. motifs M1, M2, M3, and M8 were found in both the non-INDEL and INDEL strains, while M4, M5, and M6 exclusively appeared within INDEL strains. in Indiana12.83/USA/2013, nucleotides that were identical to those found in the reference strain were clearly consistent with the presence of the corresponding motif. motifs M7 and M8, which were not found in Indiana12.83/USA/2013, were found at the position of these motifs. the difference between the reference strain and the strain ZMDZY at these three motifs was between 0\u20133 nt (i.e., 99.8\u2013100% identical) for the M6 motif, some global INDEL strains [9] such as virulent DR13 (JQ023161) detected in Korea in 1999 [38], CH/S (JN547228) detected in China in 1986 [37], and CV777 detected in Belgium in 1977 [39] were found nearest among the the position of the detected motifs was identified in the reference genome of the USA PEDV strain, Colorado/USA/2013. all eight motifs were distributed along with the ORF 1a, 1b, S, and ORF3 genes. M6 was the only motif spanning different genes. a position in Colorado/USA/2013; b Number of sites with one or more inconsistency within the 119 strains. the numbers on the x-axis represent the position of the motifs in the genome as the number of nucleotides from the 5\u2019UTR. motifs M7 and M8 were found in only two strains from the USA and Korea. the presence of nucleotides was graphically compared with the actual nucleotide sequences within PEDV strains using the strain Indiana12.83/USA/2013 as a reference. BLAST search for the identified motifs Since the strain Indiana12.83/USA/2013 had six motifs (M1\u2013M6) it was provisionally defined as the reference strain for the six motifs in the BLAST search. differences between the reference strain and the strain ZMDZY at these three motifs were between 0\u20133 nt (i.e., 99.8\u2013100% identical) phylogenetic tree analysis and whole-genome sequencing are the most recent tools for deciphering this relationship. but the interpretation of the results obtained from phylogenetic analyses can be controversial, especially when results were compared between different regions of the genome or between results using partial and whole genome sequences [9,19,22]. strains included in this study, 72 strains from the USA and 2 strains from Mexico were already analyzed by phylogenic tree analysis in a previous study. all eight strains grouped as a single clade named US INDEL strains by phylogenic analysis were also found to have the same motif M6 in this study. the difference between these five strains and the other strains in the same clade was not clear. Indiana12.83/USA/2013 was the first strain detected (in June 2013) among the 119 strains included in this study, this strain may be the source of all six motifs. there were strains that were detected in the USA earlier than Indiana12.83/USA/2013. elucidation of relationship between motifs and viral features should be a target for future study. some things should be considered when attempting to utilize sequence motifs as an indicator of epidemiological relationship between causative agents of infectious diseases. the reason for this is that such strains may increase the number of inconsistent sites. the analysis of sequence motifs shown here is a novel tool to evaluate the relationship between strains of causative agents using whole genome sequence data. the analysis of sequence motifs shown here is a novel tool to evaluate the relationship between strains of causative agents using whole genome sequence data. click here for additional data file.
