{"summary": "all tissues were collected from animals euthanized under approval of the university of Iowa IACUC. all IACUC-approved animal protocols were performed in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act,3 Animal Welfare Regulations,4 the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals. lung mouse C57BL/6a 2 M 10 mo liver, spleen, lung Mouse C57BL/6a 2 M 10 mo liver, spleen, lung Mouse C57BL/6a 2 M 17 mo liver, spleen, lung Mouse BALB/c 1 F 11 mo liver, spleen, lung Rat Fischer 344 1 M 6 mo liver, spleen, lung Rat Fischer 344 1 M 6 mo liver, spleen, lung Rat Fischer 344 1 M 6 mo liver the collection and use of human lung tissue was approved by the Institutional Review Board (University of Iowa); these de-identified samples were collected from archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks. from these samples, regions of inflamed and noninflamed lung were identified. al antibody (DAB Plus, Dako) was applied to tissues for 5 min (room temperature), followed by DAB enhancer (Dako) for 3 min, and then counterstain (Surgipath Hematoxylin, Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) for 1 min. tissue morphology was examined by 2 reviewers, one of whom is a veterinary comparative pathologist. masked observer ranked images (n = 12) from least (1) to most (12) activated according to macrophage activation based on morphology. ranked scores (n = 2 per animal) were averaged for each animal for subsequent statistical analysis. spleen, lung mouse 129a 2 F 5 mo liver, spleen, lung mouse 129a 2 F 5 mo liver, spleen, lung mouse 129a 2 F 5 mo liver, spleen, lung mouse 129a 2 F 5 mo liver, spleen, lung mouse C57BL/6a 2 F 4 mo liver, spleen, lung mouse C57BL/6a 2 F 4 mo liver, spleen, lung mouse C57BL/6a 2 liver, spleen, lung Rat WKY 1 M 2.5 mo lung Rat SHR 1 M 2.5 mo lung Rat SHR 1 M 2.5 mo lung Rat SHR 1 M 2.5 mo lung Rat SHR 1 M 2.5 mo lung Rat LE 2 F 17 mo liver, spleen, lung Rat LE 1 M 22 mo liver, spleen, lung Rat LE 1 M 18 mo liver, spleen, lung Ferret Wild type 2 F 6 mo liver, spleen, lung Ferret Wild type immunohistochemistry for AIF1 was performed as previously validated for the detection of microglia in the brains of humans and pigs. formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues were sectioned (thickness, approximately 4 m), placed on glass slides, baked (60 \u00b0C, 60 min; Isotemp Oven, Fisher Scientific), and hydrated through a series of alcohol and xylene baths. staining intensity of AIF1 in the spleen was evaluated by using a semiquantitative scoring system: 0, absence of brown staining; 1, mild brown staining that did not obstruct viewing of the blue cytoplasmic counterstain; and 3, strong, robust dark brown staining that completely obstructed viewing of the blue cytoplasmic counterstain. liver samples showed multifocal, moderate to robust, AIF1 immunostaining in scattered interstitial macrophages. hepatocytes were negative for AIF1 immunostaining across species. in spleen, moderate to robust AIF1 cellular immunostaining was detected in the red pulp. es reveals more intense staining in red pulp than white pulp in mice. differences in ferrets and pigs did not achieve statistical significance. a papillary adenoma in the lung of a mouse had scattered robust AIF1 immunostaining in macrophages within the tumor. chromogen and hematoxylin counterstain; magnification: 200 (A through C), 100 (D), 400 (C and D). we examined samples of noninflamed and inflamed human lung tissue to determine whether AIF1 immunostaining was similar between these conditions. in noninflamed lung, AIF1+ macrophages had similar localization patterns as in samples from animal models. immunocytochemistry of alveolar macrophages obtained through bronchoalveolar lavage of SHR and WKY rats did not show any staining or morphologic differences. however, AIF1 immunostaining of WKY alveolar macrophages showed mild to moderate immunostaining in a diffuse cytoplasmic pattern, whereas SHR alveolar macrophages were often increased in size (cytoplasm and nuclei) with central pallor. ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 or even IFN-responsive transcript 1, but AIF1 is currently the preferred nomenclature for the marker. ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 or even IFN-responsive transcript 1 is the preferred nomenclature for the marker. prospective use of a polyclonal primary antibody was advantageous and supported increased likelihood of marker detection across several species. the prospective use of AIF1 in the same platform (that is, technique) offers cost savings to the research laboratory and facilitates increased importance and immediacy of translation."}
