{"summary": "one third of the population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. IL-12, IFN-, and TNF signaling pathways are strongly associated with increased susceptibility to mycobacterial disease. IL-12 stimulates differentiation and activation of CD4+ Th1 cells to release IFN- (11\u201313) T cell proliferation (24) and IFN- production (24, 25) from PBMCs obtained from PTB patients have been shown to be impaired in response to M. tuberculosis stimulation by endogenous IL-10. production of IL-10 by human macrophages infected with M. tuberculosis has also been shown to inhibit phagosome maturation. overexpression of IL-10 increases host susceptibility to TB by limiting Th1 cell responses and macrophage bactericidal functions. IL-10 can be produced by almost all cell types of both the innate (e.g., macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, dendritic cells [DCs] and adaptive (e.g., T and B cells) immune response. IL-10 expression is detected early in Ly6C+ monocytes and after day 21 postinfection in T cells. increased control of M. tuberculosis infection was observed in Il10-deficient mice. female mice were used between 8 and 16 wk of age. all protocols for breeding and experiments were performed in accordance with home office (U.K.) requirements. cells were pretreated for 10 min with anti-FcgRI/FcgRII (anti-CD16/CD32) Ab. cells were then stained with anti-Thy1.1 (HIS51; eBioscience) and other Abs against the following extracellular markers to identify myeloid cells and lymphocytes. ulated ex vivo with M. tuberculosis tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD; 20 g/ml; Statens Serum Institute) and anti-CD28 (2 g/ml, clone 37.51; Harlan) for 20 h. stained samples were fixed with stabilizing fixative (BD) and refrigerated overnight. primer probes (Applied Biosystems) for Il10 (Mm00439616_m1), Ifng (Mm01168134_m1), Csf2 (Mm01290062_m1), and Hprt1 (Mm00446968_m1) were used. p 0.05 was considered significant. experimental infection M. tuberculosis experiments were performed under BSL-3 conditions. mice were infected via the aerosol route using a three-jet nebulizer unit. mice were euthanized by CO2 inhalation and the lungs were aseptically excised, individually homogenized. myeloid cell markers included Ly6G (1A8; eBioscience), Ly6C (HK1.4; eBioscience), Thy1.2 (53-2.1; eBioscience), CD11c (HL3; BD), CD11b (M1/70; BD), F4/80 (BM8; eBioscience), and MHC class II (M5/114.15.2; eBioscience). in some experiments, anti-CD44 (1M7; eBioscience) Ab was all stained samples were fixed with stabilizing fixative (BD) and refrigerated in the dark overnight before being acquired on a CyAN ADP analyzer (Dako, Ely, U.K.) data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star). quantitative real time-PCR CD4+ cells from infected WT, Il27ra/, and Ifnar1/ mice were enriched from lung homogenates using anti-CD4 microbeads (L statistical tests were used to compare experimental groups. p 0.05 was considered significant. specific cellular sources of IL-10 during M. tuberculosis infection are still undetermined. a small proportion (5\u201320%) of CD11b+ DCs, alveolar and interstitial macrophages, and Ly6C and Ly6C+ monocytes expressed detectable levels of IL-10 already at the steady-state. despite this increased frequency in IL-10+ cells, relatively low numbers of alveolar and interstitial macrophages and CD11b+ DCs expressing IL-10 were detected in the lungs. cytometry plots show concatenated data of five lungs at day 28 postinfection. the percentage (middle panel) and the total number (right panel) of Il10 (Thy1.1)-expressing cells in the lungs for each indicated population are shown as mean SEM. results are representative of three or more independent experiments with individual mice. 10BiT IL-10 reporter mice were infected with M. tuberculosis HN878. at indicated days postinfection, lung cell suspensions were prepared and stained. 10BiT IL-10 reporter mice were infected with M. tuberculosis HN878. bacterial loads in the lungs were determined after 60 d of infection. mRNA levels are significantly diminished/almost abrogated in all of the respective specific cell types from Il10fl/fl LysM-Cre+, Il10fl/fl CD11c-Cre+, Il10fl/fl CD4-Cre+, and Il10fl/fl CD19-Cre+ mice. Tnf or Ifng mRNA expression was unaffected at day 60 postinfection. M. tuberculosis infection with nearly 60% inhibition of bacterial growth compared with Cre control mice. IL-10\u2013producing CD11c+ cells, such as DCs and/or alveolar or interstitial macrophages, may partially limit the control of M. tuberculosis infection. all T cell subsets analyzed after days 14 and 21 postinfection. IL-10\u2013producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were detected in large numbers in infected lungs. IL-10\u2013producing T cells and \u201cother\u201d double-negative T cells were detected at lower numbers. 10BiT IL-10 reporter mice were infected with M. tuberculosis HN878. Flow cytometry plots show concatenated data of five lungs at day 28 postinfection. percentage (middle panels) and total number (right panels) of Il10 (Thy1.1)-expressing cells in the lungs for each indicated population are shown as mean SEM. expression of CD44, Tbet, and IFN- by IL-10 suggests highly activated effector T cells are the major source of T cell\u2013derived IL-10 during M. tuberculosis infection. 10BiT IL-10 reporter mice were infected with M. tuberculosis HN878. differences were tested for significance by an unpaired Student t test. IL-27 and type I IFN enhance Il10 expression in CD4+ T cells during M. tuberculosis infection. 4+ T cells were significantly reduced in both Il27ra/ and Ifnar1/ mice. expression of Il10 mRNA remained slightly reduced in CD4+ T cells. similar levels of Ifng mRNA expression were detected in CD4+ T cells from WT, Il27ra/, and Ifnar1/ mice. cells were isolated from infected mice at days 28 and 60 postinfection. IL-10 expression in 10BiT reporter mice was determined by comparing its staining profile with that seen in WT C57BL/6 control mice. newtrophils expressed very low levels of IL-10 at the steady-state (day 0) and throughout the course of infection. a small proportion (5\u201320%) of CD11b+ DCs, alveolar and interstitial macrophages expressed detectable levels of IL-10 already at the steady-state. frequency of IL-10\u2013expressing cells increased 2- to 3-fold among Ly6C+ monocytes and interstitial macrophages. Flow cytometry plots show concatenated data of five lungs at day 28 postinfection from one representative experiment. percentage (middle panel) and total number of Il10 (Thy1.1)-expressing cells in the lungs for each indicated population are shown as mean SEM. results are representative of three or more independent experiments with individual mice. IL-10\u2013expressing T cells are detected in high numbers in the lung during the adaptive immune response to M. tuberculosis infection. 10BiT IL-10 reporter mice were infected with M. tuberculosis HN878. 10BiT IL-10 reporter mice were infected with M. tuberculosis HN878. at indicated days postinfection, lung cells were analyzed for the expression of Il10 (Thy1.1+) selective deletion of Il10 in LysM+ cells (monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils), CD11c+ cells (mostly DCs and macrophages), or B cells could reproduce the phenotype observed in fully deficient Il10/ mice. we infected WT, Il10/, Il10fl/fl LysM-Cre+, Il10fl/fl CD11c-Cre+, Il10fl/fl CD4 mice deficient in IL-10 (Il10fl/fl CD4-Cre+) showed a significant decrease in lung bacterial loads after 60 d of M. tuberculosis infection, with nearly 60% inhibition of bacterial growth compared with Cre control mice. IL-10\u2013producing CD11c+ cells, such as DCs and/or alveolar or interstitial macrophages, may also partially limit the control of M. tuberculosis infection. IL-10 expression was barely detected under steady-state conditions. despite the low frequency of IL-10+ cells among these T cell subsets, IL-10\u2013producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were detected in large numbers in infected lungs after day 21 postinfection. IL-10\u2013producing T cells and \u201cother\u201d double-negative T cells were detected at lower numbers at all time points analyzed. 10BiT IL-10 reporter mice were infected with M. tuberculosis HN878. at indicated days postinfection, lung T cell subsets were analyzed. percentage (middle panels) and total number of Il10 (Thy1.1)-expressing cells in the lungs for each indicated population are shown as mean SEM. higher frequencies of IFN-+ cells were detected among IL-10\u2013expressing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells compared with their respective IL-10 counterparts. expression of CD44, Tbet, and IFN- by IL-10\u2013expressing CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets suggests highly activated effector T cells are the major source of T cell\u2013derived IL-10 during M. tuberculosis infection. one representative experiment out of four (for CD8+ T cells) or six (for CD4+ T cells) independent experiments. percentage of IFN-expressing cells among Il10+ (Thy1.1+) or Il10 (Thy1.1) cells is shown as mean SEM. differences were tested by an unpaired Student t test. bacterial loads were detected in the lungs of Ifnar1/ mice. expression of Il10 mRNA in purified CD4+ T cells was significantly reduced. CD4+ T cells from Il27ra/-infected mice showed increased levels of mRNA. 1/ mice were infected with M. tuberculosis HN878. IL-10 is expressed by cells from both the innate (predominantly by monocytes) and adaptive (predominantly by T cells) immune response during M. tuberculosis infection. the total number of IL-10+ cells in the lungs of M. tuberculosis\u2013infected mice greatly increased until day 28 postinfection. this kinetic of IL-10 expression is in line with the levels of IL-10 produced upon ex vivo stimulation of cells isolated from the lungs of M. tuberculosis\u2013infected mice reported previously (52) Neutrophils have been shown to produce IL-10 in response to M. tuberculosis infection in vitro expression of IL-10 during M. tuberculosis infection was not restricted to innate cells. specific deletion of Il10 in these cells showed no effect in bacterial clearance. mice with specific deletion of Il10 in T cells were more resistant to M. tuberculosis infection. CD4+ cells represented only a minor population of IL-10\u2013expressing CD4+ T cells. despite the potential of Treg cells to produce IL-10 during M. tuberculosis infection, protective phenotype observed in T cell\u2013specific IL-10\u2013deficient mice is unlikely to be a result of partial loss of the regulatory function of Treg cells. our findings suggest a role for IL-10 derived from IFN-+ T cells in suppressing host-protective immune response to M. tuberculosis infection in mouse. the role of IL-27 in regulating T cell production of IL-10 during M. tuberculosis infection is still unclear. we have previously reported that type I IFN induces IL-10 and IL-27 production by M. tuberculosis\u2013infected macrophages in vitro. however, the effect of type I IFN on CD4+ T cells seems to be independent of its induction of IL-27."}
