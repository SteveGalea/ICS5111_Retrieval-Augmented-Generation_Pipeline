{"summary": "objective was to assess the impact of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak on the use of emergency resources. results Following the MERS outbreak, there was an increase in overall ED visits by febrile patients and the proportion of visits by febrile patients. overcrowding occurs when the number of patients exceeds the physical or staffing capacity of the department. overcrowding occurs when the number of patients exceeds the physical or staffing capacity of the department. data for patients visiting three emergency facilities were extracted from the national emergency department information system (NEDIS) the unified medical language system was used for data extraction from the NEDIS database and data transfer from each hospital to the national emergency medical center. data for the period between September and December were collected between 2012 and 2014. the total number of febrile patients and the proportion of febrile patients out of the total number of ED attendances was normalized with the proportion in 2012 for each hospital as a relative proportion. the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients after the outbreak were compared with data for the three years preceding the outbreak. data for the equivalent period in 2015 were collected for patients with febrile symptoms. data were collected using a computerized electronic database format from each hospital. personally identifiable information, including name, identification number, and address, was not collected. key's honest significant difference test was used to compare the relative proportions, mean age, duration of symptoms before ED visit, length of ED stay, vital signs, and clinical outcome variables. chi square test was used to compare the relative proportions, mean age, duration of symptoms before ED visit, length of ED stay, and clinical outcome variables, among the four years. the proportion of febrile patients, 6.01%, 6.82%, 6.57%, and 9.58%, respectively, between 2012 and 2015, accounted for an average relative proportion of 1.23 for each hospital in 2015. this means that the use of emergency facilities by febrile patients was significantly increased, above the annual increment of all ED patients.

UF patients with mild fever used emergency services at an earlier stage. the pulse rate did not change in both age groups. admission rates were 0.31%, 0.30%, 0.37% and 0.35% for OF patients. a total of 17,662 patients used selected emergency medical centers during the study period, after the outbreak. this was greater than the average number of patients during the preceding three years (P=0.03) the proportion of febrile patients was defined as the proportion of febrile patients out of all patients normalized for each year after the outbreak to the proportion in 2012 for each hospital. 9,485 - Age (yr) 35.9 1.2 36.5 1.1 39.9 1.1 33.0 0.9 0.001 1.3 0.0 1.4 0.0 1.3 0.0 1.6 0.0 0.001 Sex, male (%) 4,000 (50.5) 3,796 (52.6) 5,122 (68.1) 5,457 (59.5) 0.001 3,374 (54.7) 3,746 (54.8) 4,440 (53.3) 5,064 (53.4) 0.11 Length of ED 0.0 0.001 38.4 0.0 38.3 0.0 38.3 0.0 38.3 0.0 0.001 Respiration rate (/min) 21.6 0.1 21.7 0.1 21.1 0.2 21.4 0.1 0.001 25.6 0.2 25.7 0.1 26.8 0.2 26.5 0.1 0.23 Admission rate (%) 30.1 36.9 35.4 36.6 0.35 16.5 13.9 16.2 15.8 0.78 Hospital days 10.9 12.6 11.3 13.0 12.2 14.4 arrival was 2.21 days in 2015, with no difference in the duration during previous years (P=0.05). UF patients visited the ED after an average duration of fever of 1.66 days in 2015, which was significantly longer than the average duration in previous years. ED length of stay increased to 3.48 hours for all patients. the pulse rate showed no change after the outbreak in all groups. bar heights indicate mean values and the error bars represent the 95% confidence interval for the means. admission rates were 0.31%, 0.30%, 0.37%, and 0.35% for OF patients and 0.17%, 0.14%, 0.16%, and 0.16% for UF patients. air droplets from patients with highly transmittable respiratory illness can turn emergency rooms into vectors for transmission. ED crowding can accelerate airborne transmission in busy ED rooms without appropriate isolation. many researchers and societies have developed measures to prevent ED crowding. a previous study reported the adverse impact of Ebola on the health system in Sierra Leone, with a strong decrease in the use of healthcare facilities in pediatric and maternal groups. a cross sectional study on healthcare utilization after a respiratory transmittable disease outbreak reported a trend of increased medical resource use and hospitalization for publicly insured patients. the mortality of MERS was less than that of Ebola and the outbreak of MERS in Korea was limited to hospital-to-hospital or intra-hospital transmission. this indicates that more patients with milder symptoms use emergency resources and more patients seek emergency care. the impact of an outbreak of a transmittable respiratory illness on ED crowding has not been assessed because it is uncommon to obtain serial data for patients visiting the ED to make comparisons before and after the outbreak."}
