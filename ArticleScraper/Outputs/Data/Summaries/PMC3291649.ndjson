{"summary": "human immunodeficiency virus type 1 gag encodes a polypeptide Pr55gag that can self-assemble into virus-like particles (VLPs) During or soon after virus release from cells, Pr55gag is cleaved by viral protease (PR) into four major products: matrix (MA, p17), capsid (CA, p24), nucleocapsid (NC, p7), and p6 domains. RT deletion mutations can lead to severely impaired PR-mediated Gag processing. efavirenz, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, enhances RT dimerization in vitro [27], [28], reduces virus production due to markedly enhanced PR-mediated Gag cleavage [31]. to test this possibility, we removed the RT and IN sequences and placed a leucine zipper (LZ)-coding sequence at the C-terminus of PR. results indicate that LZ placement significantly reduced virion release due to enhanced Gag cleavage. indicated are the HIV Gag protein domains MA (matrix), CA (capsid), NC (nucleocapsid), p6, pol-encoded p6pol, PR, and RT. the \u201cX\u201d in D25 denotes a PR-inactivated mutation. cellular Pr55gag and p24gag levels were quantified by scanning Pr55gag and p24gag band densities from immunoblots. values were determined for the wt and each mutant (panel A, bottom), or normalized to those of wt in parallel experiments (panel B). values were derived from three independent experiments; bars indicate standard deviation. cellular p24gag/Pr55gag ratios compared to those found in wt and mutants. this suggests that the virus-associated Gag precursor was significantly reduced when D25 escaped PR-mediated cleavage. the virus-associated Gag precursor that we detected may reflect, at least, the release of assembled Gag molecules. similar results were observed when the PRWz or PRWWz was coexpressed with a wt HIV-1 expression vector. similar results were observed when the PRWz or PRWWz was coexpressed with a wt HIV-1 expression vector. the PRWwz transfectant frequently expressed a lower Gag level compared to other constructs. the PRWwz assembly defect is PR activity-dependent. cells and culture supernatant were collected, prepared, and subjected to Western immunoblot analysis. cells and culture supernatant were treated with the HIV-1 protease inhibitor (PI) Saquinavier at concentrations of 0.01 (lanes 2 and 6), 0.1 (lanes 3 and 7), or 1.0 M (lanes 4 and 8) at 48\u201372 h post-transfection, cells were collected, prepared, and subjected to Western immunoblot analysis. chimeras were introduced into a PR-inactivated HIV-1 Pr160gag-pol-expression plasmid GPfs [4], with gag and pol in the same reading frame. chimeras with predicted molecular weights were detected in both supernatants and cell lysates following transient expression in 293T cells. a non-myristylated (myr-) Gag mutant [32] known to be severely defective in both membrane binding and multimerization served as a negative control. our data indicate that most of the wt Gag was recovered at fractions 3 to 5; in contrast, most of the wt Gag and substantial amounts of MoGag were recovered at fractions 1 and 2. fused leucine zipper domains wt (Wz) or mutant (Kz) at the PR C-terminus are indicated. x denotes substitution mutations in CA, NC (NC15A) and PR that blocked either Gag assembly or PR activity. sD multimerization via PR dimer interaction produced VLPs at a relatively lower level compared to WtGag. this may have been due to its lack of p6gag, which is required for efficient virus budding [33], [34] indicated are domains for HIV-1 Gag and pol-encoded p6pol, PR, and RT. wild-type (Wz) and mutant (Kz) leucine zipper domains are indicated as described above. 293T cells were transfected with designated constructs containing a normal myristylation or myristylation-minus (myr-) mutation (lanes 5\u20138) at 4 h post-transfection, equal amounts of cells were placed on two dish plates. at 4 h post-transfection, equal amounts were placed on two dish plates. unprocessed Gag (the precursor Pr55) and incompletely processed Gag (the intermediate p41gag) represent two major Gag products compared to wt in our supernatant and cell samples. this is consistent with a report stating that a deletion in a downstream pol sequence significantly impairs PR-mediated virus maturation [23]. cellular Pr55gag, p41gag, and p24gag levels were quantified by scanning Pr55gag and p24gag band densities from immunoblots. natants were collected at 48\u201372 h post-transfection and subjected to Western immunoblotting. VLP levels produced by PRWKz and PRKWz (lanes 7 and 8) were in-between those produced by PRWKz and PRKWz (lanes 7 and 8). wt LZ fusion-containing constructs exhibited higher ratios of cellular p24gag to Pr55gag compared to those found in Gag/PR cell lysates. this suggests that the virus-associated Gag precursor that we detected may reflect, at least, the release PRWz or PRWWz were coexpressed with wt or the HIV-1 protease-defective mutant D25. similar results were observed when the PRWz or PRWWz was coexpressed with either PRWz or PRWWz at a 11 ratio. the PRWz transfectant frequently expressed a lower Gag level compared to other constructs. 293T cells were transfected with wt or mutant plasmids. at 4 h post-transfection, cells were either left untreated or treated with the HIV-1 protease inhibitor (PI) Saquinavier at concentrations of 0.01 (lanes 2 and 6), 0.1 (lanes 3 and 7), or 1.0 M (lanes 4 and 8). ions with cone-shaped cores were only detected in non-PI-treated wt transfectant samples. some vesicles lacking cores were noted, but virion-size particles containing electron-dense cores were not detected in mock-transfected samples. these data support the hypothesis that the LZ-incurred assembly defect is PR activity-dependent. sWz transfectants produced more chimeric VLPs than MoGagfsD or MoGagfsKz. a non-myristylated (myr-) Gag mutant [32] known to be severely defective in both membrane binding and multimerization served as a negative control. most of the wt Gag was recovered at fractions 3 to 5; in contrast, most myr- Gag and substantial amounts of MoGag were recovered at leucine zipper domains wt (Wz) or mutant (Kz) at the PR C-terminus are indicated. x denotes substitution mutations in CA, NC (NC15A) and PR that blocked either Gag assembly or PR activity. moGag molecules were mostly sedimented at fractions 3 to 5. p6pol-PR contributed to moGag multimerization via PR dimer interaction. this may have been due to p6gag, which is required for efficient virus budding. g/Pr55gag ratios compared to MoGag/PR, but slightly lower compared to PRWWz. it suggests that the multimerization-defective Gag mutation reduced the enhancement of Gag cleavage. it supports the proposal that the Gag assembly domain plays a role in PR activation. effect of LZ on Gag cleavage is independent of myristylation. 293T cells were transfected with designated constructs containing a normal myristylation or myristylation-minus (myr-) mutation. at 4 h post-transfection, equal amounts of cells were placed on two dish plates. cellular Pr55gag was barely detected in PRWWz at 12 and 24 h post-transfection. most Pr55gag remained unprocessed in wt transfectants 12 h post-transfection. these results suggest that LZ-enhanced Gag cleavage is associated with premature Gag processing due to premature. myr- Gag-Pol can effectively cleave Pr55gag in trans and be packaged into Pr55gag VLPs. the multimerization defect as a result of membrane binding apparently does not compromise the LZ enhancement of PR-mediated Gag cleavage. RT homodimerization domain has no enhancement effect on Gag cleavage [48] unless EFV is added to culture medium. a single RT amino acid substitution (W402A) that is not known to have major impacts on in vitro RT dimerization [50] markedly enhances Gag processing [31] inactivated PR dimer interface mutations can be compensated for to some extent by extra PR sequences in the Gag-Pol context. studies are underway to determine if LZ sufficiently compensates for the inactivation of PR dimer interface mutations. the human CREB LZ sequence is 284-RECRRKKKEYVKCLENRVAVLENQNKTLIEELKALKDLYCHKSD-327. the underlined amino acid residues E298, R300, E305, Q307, I312, E314, and L321 were mutated to Lys, and N308 was mutated to His. the backbone of all expression constructs is the HIV-1 proviral plasmid HIVgpt [57]. transfected 293T cells were trypsinized, split 110 and seeded onto 10-cm dish plates 24 hours before transfection. samples were subjected to microcentrifugation at 4\u00b0C for 15 min at 13,700g (14,000 r.p.m.) electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. membrane-bound Gag proteins were immunodetected using an anti-p24gag antibody at a 15,000 dilution from ascites. five 0.8-ml fractions were collected from the top of the centrifuge tubes. the proteins present in aliquots of each fraction were precipitated with 10% TCA and subjected to western blot analysis. the human CREB LZ sequence is 284-RECRRKKKEYVKCLENRVAVLENQNKTLIEELKALKDLYCHKSD-327. the underlined amino acid residues E298, R300, E305, Q307, I312, E314, and L321 were mutated to Lys, and N308 was mutated to His. the backbone of all expression constructs is the HIV-1 proviral plasmid HIVgpt [57]. transfected 293T cells were trypsinized, split 110 and seeded onto 10-cm dish plates 24 hours before transfection. samples were subjected to microcentrifugation at 4\u00b0C for 15 min at 13,700g (14,000 r.p.m.) electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. membrane-bound Gag proteins were immunodetected using an anti-p24gag antibody at a 15,000 dilution from ascites. five 0.8-ml fractions were collected from the top of the centrifuge tubes. the proteins present in aliquots of each fraction were precipitated with 10% TCA."}
