{"summary": "acutely behaving interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) comprise several diseases with both known and unknown causes. a common feature in these acute manifestations is the appearance of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) in the lung. the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying each of these disorders and their acute exacerbations are largely unknown. catenstein and co-authors presented their findings in their comprehensive review article. they concluded that DAD is a nonspecific reaction of the lung to a multitude of injurious agents, and that endothelial and alveolar cell injury leads to fluid and cellular exudation. autopsy findings of 17 patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) of which most had DAD in their lungs cytomegalovirus. Idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIP) comprise a disease group that belongs to the ILDs. the classification of IIPs has changed several times in the past five decades. idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIP) comprise a disease group that belongs to the ILDs. IPF AIP NSIP Age/sex 50\u201370 years, more common in females than in males 40\u201360 years, also in children. most of the patients had died after 2\u20134 years after diagnosis In-hospital mortality 12%\u201350%, 70% mortality in 6 months 5 year survival 74%\u201382 % Course of disease Usually slowly progressive over within years. no or scant honeycombing Histopathology Heterogenous appearance with areas of normal parenchyma, fibrosis and honeycomb cysts, which is termed as UIP. AE of UIP show also DAD in addition to UIP. NSIP was described in 1995 by Katzenstein and Fiorelli. it is the most common type of interstitial pneumonias associated with many CVDs. children may also suffer NSIP as an idiopathic disease or a CVD-associated disease. histological pattern of AIP is typically DAD with hyaline membranes, edema, and interstitial acute inflammation. the prognosis of AIP is dismal and the mortality high. NSIP NSIP was described in 1995 by Katzenstein and Fiorelli. it is a disease that may be idiopathic, although it is the most common type of interstitial pneumonias associated with many CVDs. it occurs more often in women than in men than in men. fibrotic form of NSIP may include more advanced fibrosis. prognosis of fibrotic type of NSIP is dismal. AE and DAD are very similar to in the above described disease. radiological and histological findings of a patient who was actively treated by mechanical ventilation and high doses of corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs. HRCT and Chest-X-ray have been taken 2-3 days before taking the lung biopsy by VATS. a recent study showed that one-year and three-year incidence of AE of IPF was 14.2% and 20.7%, respectively. previous or concurrent diagnosis of IPF Unexplained worsening or development of dyspnea within 30 days HRCT with new bilateral ground-glass abnormality. AE of IPF showed significant elevations in markers of type II alveolar epithelial cell injury and/or proliferation, endothelial cell injury, and coagulation. akira and co-authors studied 58 IPF-patients with AE [44] two radiologists evaluated the features with high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) a study evaluating the use of pirfenidone in patients with IPF had to be terminated prematurely because in the placebo-control group the patients suffered more AEs than occurred in the pirfenidone group. this indicates that the drug might have some efficacy in the prevention of AE of IPF. 83 biopsied patients with CVD and ILD experienced a clinical course similar to that of AE of IPF. all cases resulted either in death of the patient or lung transplantation. the prognosis of the patients with CVD is generally significantly better compared to IPF. current invasive/intensive treatment has no definitive role in AE of IPF. intensive treatment should be considered in acute exacerbations of the other ILDs. however, it is often very difficult to exclude infections of the IPF patients experiencing an acute deterioration. the most common histological pattern of ARDS is AFOP. a retrospective study on 58 patients with DAD lung histopathology revealed that 60% of them were immunocompromised and 90% of them fulfilled the ARDS criteria at the time of the lung biopsy. the overall mortality for the lung diseases was 53%, with the exception of AE of IPF, in which the mortality was higher, being 86%. the histology of DAD is not able to reveal the cause of alveolar damage, although a recent study depicted two forms of DAD in patients with ARDS. the most extensive manifestations of H1N1-influenza will be observed in the lungs and there is a risk for the development of DAD. the viruses include hepatitis C [84], Ebstein Barr [85], cytomegalo, and other herpes viral infections [86]. many factors in the pathogenesis of DAD remain unresolved. if one could understand the mechanisms underlying the reaction, it might be possible to use this novel information to develop improved treatment for many lung diseases. most experimental studies have been conducted with animals exposed to toxins, lipopolysaccharide, and so forth. these reactions cannot be extrapolated to human lung because lung reactions occurring in mice and rats do not resemble exactly those encountered in human lung. a systematic collection of human lung tissue and cell material would significantly improve the clinical-radiological-histopathological interpretation."}
