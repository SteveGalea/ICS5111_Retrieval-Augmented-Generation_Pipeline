{"summary": "the world health organization estimates the burden of influenza at 3\u20135 million cases of severe illness and >300,000 deaths annually. each year, influenza virus causes 65 million illnesses and 25,000 deaths in the united states alone. NF-B signaling, PI3K/Akt pathway, MAPK pathway, PKC/PKR signaling, and TLR/RIG-I signaling cascades are altered following influenza infection. NF-B is a nuclear factor B, a transcriptional factor which plays a central role in promoting the expression of more than 150 genes. IKK2 degrades the IB and activates NF-B, while IKK1 phosphorylates the other factors of the NF-B family, such as p100/p52 [15]. HA, NA, M1, NEP, M2, PB1-F2 are late proteins and synthesize in 5\u201310 h.p.i. this process leads to the virus production in between 5\u201312 h.p.i. viral proteins are sufficient to transcriptionally activate NF-B by involving the generation of oxidative radicals which activate IKK as a signal transduction intermediate. PI3K \u2013 Akt pathway Influenza A virus infection also activates the PI3K/Akt pathway. class II PI3K is composed of 3 catalytic subunits (C2, C2, and C2) but no regulatory subunit. they catalyze the generation of phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PIP), phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate (PIP2) and phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3). the NS5A protein of HCV directly binds to the SH3 domain of p85 and induces PI3K/Akt-mTOR signaling to control cell survival. other viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) manipulate PI3K activity for efficient viral replication. four distinct subgroups of the MAPK family have been well studied. p38 MAPK, p38 MAPK, c-jun N-terminal or stress-activated protein kinases (JNK/SAPK) and p38 MAPK are involved in apoptosis. the upstream Raf controls the phosphorylation of MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) 12. RANTES is induced by bonding of NF-IL-6. hepatitis C virus up regulates the p38 MAPK signaling. ERK and JNK are involved in the expression of inflammatory mediator cytooxygenase. p38 MAPK activation regulates the expression of RANTES production [47,60] and chemokines by influenza virus infection [54] IL-1 stimulates activation of p38 MAPK with prostaglandin E2 production. the p38 inhibitor decreases the release of prostaglandin E2 [57] and also reduces the virus titer. ERK can regulate the expression of TNF-, IL-12, IL-1, and inhibition of ERK by U0126 inhibitor [64] can also reduce the rate of influenza replication by nuclear retention of vRNPs. if there is inadequate transport of HA from cytoplasm to cell surface, this could be a possible reason for the low activation of ERK [65] genes encode proteins that inhibit the IFN pathway by targeting PKR[72,73]. non-structural 5A protein of hepatitis C virus causes repression of PKR activation. NS1 blocks activation of PKR, causing inhibition of kinase activity. dsRNA viruses recognize TLR3 and retinoic-acid-inducible protein. a cytoplasmic RNA helicase plays a crucial role in detecting ssRNA. dsRNA viruses recognize TLR3 and retinoic-acid-inducible protein. the NS1 protein of influenza virus is known to interfere with IFN production by binding to TRIM25. this process suppresses the RIG-I signaling and IFN production in infected cells. it is believed that NS1 sequesters intracellular dsRNA like nucleic acids produced during viral replication."}
