{"summary": "letters sequence representation (LSR) of DNA sequences represents each base by a letter of four different letters such as A, T, G, and C. gene sequences can be represented in different dimension spaces. for example, G-curve and H-curve were first proposed by Hamori and Ruskin before thirty years. the first visualization protein model was proposed by Randi et al. until 2004 [19] some researchers have studied on graphical representation of protein sequences from different perspectives. DV-curve graphical representation of protein sequences based on the detailed hydrophobic-hydrophilic (HP) model of amino acids. sequence S = S 1 S 2 S n with length n, where S i is the letter in the ith position among the protein sequence (i = 1,2,..., n) we define a primary protein sequence as a symbolic sequence which includes four letters according to the following rule: b i = B 1, if S i np, B 2, if S i nep, B 3, if S i up, B 4, if S i pp. the representation of four alphabets of DV-curve: (a) B 1, (b) B 2, (c) B 3, and (d) B 4. We connect adjacent dots with lines and then obtain a dual-vector curve form. this process is shown in Figure 2. Figure 2. The DV-curve of sequence \u201cWTFESR\u201d. the coordinate of each point (x i, y i) can be calculated. then we connect all the points with beelines, and the DV-curve is obtained. we can also obtain the coarse-grained description of the protein sequence. a well-known model of protein sequences is the hydrophobic (H or nonpolar)-hydrophilic (P or polar), that is, the HP model may be too simple and lack enough consideration on the heterogeneity and complexity of the natural set of residues. this is called the detailed HP model, which can provide more information than the original HP model. the representation of four alphabets of DV-curve: (a) B 1, (b) B 2, (c) B 3, and (d) B 4. we connect adjacent dots with lines and then obtain a dual-vector curve form. the representation of four alphabets of DV-curve: (a) B 1, (b) B 2, (c) B 3, and (d) B 4. x 2 i 1 = 2 i 1, i = 1, 2,..., n, x 2 i = 2 i, i = 1, 2,..., n, y 2 i = 2 i, i = 1, 2,..., n, y 2 i 1 = y 2 i 2 + 1, if b i = B 1 or B 2, y 2 i 2 = 1, y 2 i y 2 i 2 = 1, y 2 the simplified protein sequence G(S) = b 1 b 2 b n can be recovered. here b i B 1, B 2, B 3, B 4 with length n. we will give numerical characterization of graphical curve as the descriptor. a protein primary sequence can be characterized by a 24-component vector. we can obtain the similarities of the two vectors by calculating Euclidean distance. if two sequences are similar, the distance between two points should be small. we construct a 24-component vector to characterize any protein sequence. the other is evolutionary homology analysis based on the numerical characterization of DV-curve. chimpanzee (NP_008197), wallaroo (NP_007405), harbor seal (H. seal) (NP_006939), gray seal (G. seal) (NP_007080), rat (AP_004903), and mouse (NP_904339) the same data set was used in [26, 27]. the DV-curve representation reflecting similarities of sequences is more simple, intuitional, and visible. the spike (S) protein is common to all known coronaviruses. the protein is crucial for viral attachment and entry into the host cell. to illustrate the use of DV-curve, we will construct the phylogenetic tree of 35 coronavirus spike proteins. oV29 1255 IV 30 AAQ01597 SCoV30 1255 IV 31 AAU81608 SCoV31 1255 IV 32 AAS00003 SCoV32 1255 IV 33 AAR86788 SCoV33 1255 IV 34 AAR23250 SCoV35 1255 IV. a protein sequence can be associated with a 24-component vector. a closer look at the subtree of the first branch shows coronavirus from three different species. a closer look at the subtree shows coronavirus from three different species. a closer look at the subtree of the first branch shows coronavirus from three different species. DH dehydrogenase subunit 6) proteins were downloaded from GenBank: human (YP_003024037.1), gorilla (NP_008223), chimpanzee (NP_008197), wallaroo (NP_007405), harbor seal (H. seal) (NP_006939), gray seal (G. seal) (NP_007080), rat (AP_004903), and mouse (NP_904339). the spike (S) protein is common to all known coronaviruses. it is crucial for viral attachment and entry into the host cell. previous phylogenetic analysis based on sequence alignments shows that SARS-CoVs come from a new group distantly related to the above three groups. a protein sequence can be associated with a 24-component vector. given two species i and j, we can calculate the distance between them. a 35 35 real symmetric matrix D = (d ij) is obtained. the group 3 coronaviruses, including oV2, CCoV6, TGEV4, FCoV1, and PEDV3, tend to cluster together in another branch. the resulting monophyletic clusters agree well with the established taxonomic groups. the conclusion is similar to that reported by other authors. approach is applied in two aspects: one is similarity intuitive analysis of ND6 protein sequences of several species. the other is phylogenetic analysis among 35 coronaviruses based on their spike proteins."}
