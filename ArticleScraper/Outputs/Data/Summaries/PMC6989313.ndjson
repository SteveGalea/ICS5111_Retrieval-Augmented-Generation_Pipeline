{"summary": "a total of 359 serum samples were collected from 55 backyard chickens and tested using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits to determine the seroprevalence of Newcastle disease virus (NDV), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), influenza type A, mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) and mycoplasma synoviae (MS) mixed infection of E. coli and MG reported in 9.1% of broiler flocks. MG was detected in 14.5% of backyard flocks and 9.1% of broiler flocks. MS was detected only in 3.6% of backyard chickens mixed with E. coli. more than 200 avian species can be infected by various NDV strains. most severely affected species by NDV strains are chickens, turkeys, pheasant, and other gallinaceous species. hyaluronic acid (HA) cleavage may encourage concurrent bacterial infection by various mechanisms [26-29]. coli infection before, after, or concurrently with H9N2 virus infection could exacerbate the adverse effects of the H9N2 virus. the samples consisted of serum (n=359), tracheal swabs (TS), cloacal swabs (n=1242), and internal organs (n=1256), including trachea, lungs, liver, spleen, kidney, and brain after necropsy. samples from each flock were pooled and treated separately. on provent. and cecal tonsils 799 300 5 10 7 23.3 + Congestion in lung, kidney, and ovary 739 80 5 10 15 37.5 + Tracheitis, airsacculitis 826 100 5 10 4 29 + + Tracheitis and congestion of lung and kidney 771 80 7 14 20 87.5 + + Hemorrhagic laryngitis, tracheitis 874 45 7 10 20 46.7 + + Laryngitis, tracheitis on provent. and cecal tonsils 1040 70 5 10 15 71.4 + Tracheal exudate, nephrosis 37 50 5 10 10 18 + Tracheal exudate 1058 150 5 6 6 33.3 + General congestion 35 110 5 12 12 21.8 + + Petich. on provent. and cecal tonsils, 104 350 6 10 10 15.7 + + Petich. on provent. and cecal tonsils 322 30 4 8 6 33.3 + + Petich. on provent. and cecal tonsils 515 100 5 10 8 5 + Tracheitis and airsacculitis 459 60 6 10 10 45 + + Petich. on provent. and cecal tonsils 551 10 5 10 8 5 + Tracheal exudate, general congestion 978 1000 7 7 - 0.3 + Tracheal congestion, general congestion 623 150 12 24 24 46.7 + + Laryngitis, tracheitis, and petch. +IB (1, 12 day) 60 60 11.3 + + Tracheal pluges, airsacculitis, nephrosis, thymus congestion 1009 26066/15 ND+IB (1, 12 day) 50 80 12.4 + + Tracheal pluges, airsacculitis, nephrosis, thymus congestion 1054 10000/24 ND+IB (1, 12 day) 20 28 1.2 + + Congestion, fibrin specific antibodies against NDV, IBV, influenza type A, MG, and MS were detected using commercial ELISA kits (IDEXX, USA) extracted viral RNAs were stored at 80\u00b0C until used in subsequent molecular techniques.

MR in non-vaccinated backyard flocks ranged from 12.8% to 44%. MR in backyard flocks suffering from a concurrent infection of NDV and E. coli ranged from 15% to 87.5%. MR in backyard flocks has mixed NDV and IBV infection ranged from 25% to 71.4%. mortality rate reached up to 71.4% and 60 % in flocks concurrently infected with IBV, H9N2 and E. coli respectively three hundred fifty-nine serum samples from 55 non-vaccinated backyard chicken flocks were examined for antibodies to NDV, IBV, AI, and MS. the prevalence of NDV in backyard chickens was 56.4%, of which 34.5% were positive for NDV antibodies only, and 21.8% flocks had specific antibodies for NDV, IBV, and AIV (type A) the prevalence of MG and MS in backyard chicken flocks was 14.5% and 3.6%, respectively, mixed with common respiratory viruses (NDV, IBV, and LPAIV H9N2). mixed infections of pathogenic bacteria and common respiratory viruses represent 9.1% of respiratory troubles in backyard chicken flocks. coli IB+AI +E. coli IB+AI +MG IB+AI +MS IB+AI +Staphylococcus Total E. coli Staphylococcus MG+ E. coli MS+ E. coli Total ND Total viral infected flocks yard 14 - - 5 - 2 5 5 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 0 Total/(%) yard. single bacterial infection represents 1.82% of the causative agent of respiratory affection, mixed infection of E. coli and MG represents 5.5%. in examined commercial chicken flocks with respiratory manifestation, 81.8% were infected with IBV and LPAIV (H9N2) the prevalence of IBV and LPAIV (H9N2) infection was 81.8% and 54.5%, respectively. NDV was not detected in any examined flocks. MR mixed infection of common respiratory viruses, pathogenic bacteria, and/or MG leads to the magnification of MRs, increasing economic losses. MR in non-vaccinated backyard flocks infected with NDV ranged from 12.8% to 44%. MR in backyard flocks suffering from a concurrent infection of NDV ranged from 15% to 87.5%. MR in vaccinated broiler flocks coinfected with IBV and LPAIV ranged from 13.3% to 27% (Tables-1 and 2). serological assay Three hundred fifty-nine serum samples from 55 non-vaccinated backyard chicken flocks were examined for antibodies to NDV, IBV, AI (type A), MG, and MS. the prevalence of MG and MS in backyard chicken flocks was 14.5% and 3.6%, respectively, mixed with common respiratory viruses (NDV, IBV, and LPAIV H9N2). mixed infections of pathogenic bacteria and common respiratory viruses (NDV, IBV, and LPAV H9N2) were recorded in 29 flocks (40%). pathogen Single infection Mixed viral and bacterial infection Total ND IB AI ND +IB +AI ND +AI +E. coli IB+AI +MG IB+AI +MS IB+AI +Staphylococcus Total E. coli Staphylococcus MG+ E. coli MS+ E. coli Total ND Total viral infected flocks yard 14 - - 5 - 2 5 5 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - pathogenic E. coli, respiratory viruses (NDV and IBV) and mycoplasma were detected concurrently in 40% of examined backyard chicken flocks. single bacterial infection represents 1.82% of the causative agent of respiratory affection. mixed infection of E. coli and MG represents 5.5%, while E. coli and MS represents 1.82%. common respiratory viruses (IBV, NDV, and low pathogenic avian influenza] H9N2) were detected in 50 backyard chicken flocks and nine broiler flocks. the most prevalent respiratory viruses in clinically infected broiler flocks were IBV (81.82%), these results are consistent with previous studies. single infection with LPAIV (H9N2) was recorded in one out of 55 examined backyard chicken flocks suffering from decreased feed intake. interaction between LPAI and NDV can replicate in upper respiratory and intestinal epithelial cells by binding to the sialic acid-containing receptors on the cell surface. this pattern of virus replication might be influenced by the previous replication of the other virus in the same site through active antiviral immune responses. the synergistic interaction between respiratory viruses (NDV, H9N2, and IBV) and avian pathogenic E. coli and S. aureus results in high losses in infected flocks, up to 87.5% in E. coli infection and 60% in S. aureus infection. viral infections induce mechanical damage of ciliated epithelium and goblet cells, which enhance the bacterial adherence and colonization [26,27] or impairment of the phagocytic function and alteration of the immune response [28] mixed infection involving one or more common respiratory viruses, mycoplasma, S. aureu s, and avian pathogenic E. coli combined with immunosuppressive agents, and unfavorable environmental conditions, are more commonly prevalent. viral interaction The infection of chickens with heterologous viruses mostly results in virus interference or synergism. the synergistic effect between IB viruses and H9N2 explained and discussed by Liu et al. and Zainab et al. [50,51] suggested that the exacerbation of pathogenicity of H9N2 AIV might be due to enhancing of HA cleavage. the most frequently detected mixed infection was IBV and E. coli in 23.6% of tested broiler flocks resulting in severe clinical outcomes and an increased MR up to 27.8%. the synergistic interaction between respiratory viruses (NDV, H9N2, and IBV) and avian pathogenic E. coli and S. aureus results in high losses in infected flocks. viral infections induce mechanical damage of ciliated epithelium and goblet cells, which enhance the bacterial adherence and colonization [26,27] or impairment of the phagocytic function and alteration of the innate immune response [28] concurrent inoculation of chickens with MG has important impacts on formation of tracheal plugs, increasing pathogenicity of LPAIV (H9N2). concurrent E. coli and MG infection-induced more severe respiratory manifestation, including severe airsacculitis, fibrinous pericarditis, and pneumonia. chicken flocks act as reservoir for most infectious pathogens disseminated to the environment. more efforts should be directed to educate backyard chicken owners to encourage them to implement preventive measures, vaccinate, and apply standard biosecurity issues."}
