{"summary": "the new society was founded in 2016 to provide support for the virology research community, including basic, clinical, government, and industry researchers working on a broad range of viruses. a satellite workshop was planned in conjunction with the annual American Society for Virology meeting in blacksburg, Virginia in June 2016. anecdotes from the 1918 pandemic and how factors such as the impact of exposure to past circulating viruses may have influenced pathogenic outcome to the 1918 pandemic. he discussed the circumstances of other pandemics of the past two centuries, and the unpredictable evolution of pandemic viruses. RISPR-Cas technology introduced the audience to a wide variety of newly discovered anti-CRISPR proteins that will be the subject of intense investigation for years to come [2,3]. he also described his efforts to bring CRISPR-Cas technology to the undergraduate laboratory curriculum at Universit\u00e9 Laval [4]. the stress of white-nose syndrome leads to a dramatic increase in corona virus replication in little brown bats. long-term viral persistence followed by stress-induced reactivation could be modeled in tissue-culture. studying interactions between bat viruses and their natural host may provide key information to prevent future zoonoses. guinea pig, rhesus and cynomolgus macaque models made-in-Canada. the Lassa fever vaccine performed well in guinea pig, rhesus and cynomolgus macaque. two conserved viral proteins, pUL31 and pUL34, assemble into an oligomeric nuclear egress complex (NEC) on the inner nuclear membrane and facilitate capsid recruitment and budding into the perinuclear space. the protein is sufficient to promote nuclear envelope vesiculation and drive nucleoplasmic invagination of the inner nuclear membrane. virions bearing the full complement of twelve trimeric 1 attachment protein complexes on their surfaces are relatively stable in the natural enteric environment. accelerated uncoating and replication in cancer cells and increased oncolytic potency in a mouse melanoma model. trainee attendees were treated to a Writing Workshop designed by science writer Alan Dove, PLoS Pathogens editor Karen Mossman and PLoS ONE senior editor Eileen Clancy. due attention was paid to making a compelling case for the importance of your research, articulation of a clear take-home message and considering the audience for your research. MTs are increasingly used to treat human intestinal diseases including ulcerative colitis [26] and antibiotic-resistant Clostridium difficile infections [27]. but little is known about how transferred phage affect the recipient microbiome. crAssphage was recently discovered by metagenomic sequencing. a single slide, Ali Zhang (McMaster University), Briti Saha (University of Ottawa) and Mariel Kleer and Andrea Monjo from Dalhousie University clearly and concisely presented their respective research projects. this was followed by a panel discussion about the future of antiviral and vaccine discovery and development. this panel provided insight into how new targets are selected and pursued. the actual Soapbox Science event launch at the Halifax Seaport Farmers\u2019 Market featured twelve scientists and attracted 600 members of public over 3 h. the event is intended to boost the visibility of female scientists and inspire the next generation. the PERCH study identified the frequency of etiologic association of different viruses with severe childhood pneumonia, widely recognized as a major cause of childhood mortality worldwide. the first scientific session focused on flow virometry was chaired by Dr. Marceline C\u00f4t\u00e9 (University of Ottawa) and led off by Dr. Roger Lipp\u00e9. this approach enabled characterization of individual HSV-1 particles harvested from different cellular compartments. Flow virometry also enables the analysis by mass spectrometry of highly enriched viral particles isolated along the egress pathway to monitor their maturation. large (10\u201330 kilobase pair) fragments of DNA were recombined into a 212 kilobase pair live synthetic chimeric virus in cells infected with Shope fibroma virus. scHPXV was safe and effective in pre-clinical studies; it produced smaller plaques in cell culture and was less virulent in mice than VACV. the Sagan (McGill University) and Wilson (University of Saskatchewan) groups investigated whether miR-122 binding to the HCV genome affects PRR binding and activation of antiviral signaling pathways. miR-122 does not affect recognition by protein kinase R (PKR), retinoic acid inducible protein I (RIG-I)-like receptors, or interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats. d viral RNA (vRNA) genome segments to the cell nucleus, each bound to the tripartite viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex simultaneously binds to host RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and 5\u2019-cap structures on nascent host pre-mRNAs. it remains unclear whether there is some selectivity in this process, or the RdRp simply \u201csnatches\u201d these primers from the most abundant nearby this week in virology podcast was created in 2008 by Columbia University professors Vincent Racaniello and Dickson Despommier to discuss science in an informal and informative manner. ten years later, the hosts got down to business with an interview of Drs. grandvaux and McCormick, who discussed their motivation in founding the CSV, the current research funding climate in Canada, and plans for the new society. internal ribosome entry sites can start translation in alternative reading frames. a subset of ribosomes recruited to the CrPV IRES can undergo a bypass mechanism to initiate translation downstream at the +1 frame 13th non-AUG codon. this suggests that ORFx plays a role in viral pathogenesis. plant virus proteases are grouped according to conserved catalytic active site residues: cysteine, serine or aspartic acid. RNA1 encodes a cysteine protease that is related to the canonical 3C protease of picornaviruses and cleaves at multiple locations on polyproteins. class A scavenger receptors (SR-As) play diverse roles in immunity in lower vertebrates. in mammals the SR-As include five family members that play diverse roles in immunity, aiding macrophage clearance of pathogens and apoptotic cells. SR-As appear to be surface receptors for dsRNA, a virus-derived innate immune stimulant. MARCO does not bind dsRNA, a unique finding in vertebrates. a cell line derived from chSE-214 appears to lack functional SR-As. the ducks rapidly mounted interferon and cytokine responses that peaked on the first day of infection. the ducks rapidly mounted interferon and cytokine responses that peaked on the first day of infection and declined thereafter. further characterization of the duck immune responses to lethal and sub-lethal infections could advance our understanding of virus\u2013host interactions in the reservoir host. oral presentation awards to Hannah Stacey from McMaster University and Carolyn Robinson from Dalhousie University. poster presentation awards to Ali Zhang and Jonathan Mapletoft from McMaster University, Shirley Qiu, Graham Gould Maule and Adrian Pelin from the University of Ottawa. a good time was had by all, including Drs. Grandvaux and Nathalie Grandvaux. a good time was had by all, including Drs. grandvaux and McCormick."}
