{"summary": "chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by a persistent airflow limitation usually associated with an increased inflammatory response. among these cells, CD8+ T-lymphocytes, neutrophils, and macrophages are prevalent. studies in stable-state COPD have observed a direct correlation between airway inflammation and the bacterial load. some studies in stable-state COPD have observed a direct correlation between airway inflammation and the bacterial load. some studies in stable-state COPD have observed a direct correlation between airway inflammation and the bacterial load. patients, 55 with normal blood 1-antitrypsin levels, 62 with severe 1-antitrypsin deficiency, and 43 with idiopathic bronchiectasis. a higher bacterial load was correlated to more severe bronchial obstruction, higher dosage of inhaled corticosteroids, and a higher C-reactive protein level. a significant bacterial load was found in all subjects without significant differences. in some smokers with normal lung function, the authors found a lower diversity of lung microbiota. it could be either an \u201ceffect\u201d of the lung inflammation or, in part, a \u201ccause\u201d of disease onset and progression. in the very severe COPD group, there was a shift in the relative abundance of a few bacterial populations without any one becoming dominant. the authors speculated that changes in the lung microbiome in more severe COPD patients could be due either to alterations of the airways typical of very severe diseased patients or to the repeated use of antibiotics. the discrepancy could be due to the small number of patients analyzed in these studies and differences in study design (Table 1). we suggest a 3-month washout period for antibiotic treatment, and at least 1-month washout for oral or inhaled corticosteroids should be considered when evaluating COPD patients in stable conditions. the airways of COPD patients have a different microbiome and a larger number of bacteria compared with normal subjects. the role of bacterial pathogens during COPD exacerbations has recently been further investigated. exacerbations of COPD are associated with changes in respiratory microbiota and airway inflammation. samples were obtained from endotracheal aspirates. the authors hypothesized the presence of two bacterial microbiota related to exacerbated COPD. a decreased bacterial diversity was correlated with the length of intubation. the microbiota members that resulted increased during exacerbations were mostly of the Proteobacteria phylum. treatment with antibiotics alone decreased the Proteobacteria, whereas treatment with corticosteroids alone enriched the Proteobacteria and other phyla. lower airways in COPD patients are colonized by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. lower airways in COPD patients are colonized by Streptococcus pneumoniae, and in patients with more severe disease, by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. a significant bacterial load was found in all subjects without significant differences between groups. in some smokers with normal lung function, the authors found a lower diversity of lung microbiota and speculated that this relative reduction could be persistent. the burkholderia genus represented more than 5% of the bacterial community. the increased presence of Lactobacillus in the lung could be related to an inflammatory state associated with the formation of tertiary lymphoid follicles developing near the small airways. Sze et al27 examining 40 lung samples from five COPD subjects have confirmed the reduction in microbial diversity with a relative increase of Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria. the authors reported a significant association between the alterations of the microbiome, the extent of emphysema, remodeling of bronchi and alveoli and their infiltration by CD4+ T-cells. a well-defined washout period from antibiotic and corticosteroid use is not reported in these studies. some studies considered COPD patients in a stable state after 4 weeks had lapsed from the last exacerbation. some studies considered the antibiotics used during the exacerbation phase of the patients. bacterial community Out na 0 6 tissue 4 In 23 16 8 Tissue 4 Total bacterial community Out na 25 10 10 Sputum na Strep, Kleb, Pseud Out na 26 0 17 Sputum 2\u20133\u20134 Total bacterial community Out na 28 0 8 Endotracheal aspirates 4 (exacerbated) Total bacterial community Out na 30 0 12 Sputum 2\u20133 (stable vs exacerbations of COPD are associated with changes in respiratory microbiota and airway inflammation. in 2002, sethi et al22 followed 81 patients for 56 months. the isolation of new strains of pathogens was associated with an increased risk of exacerbations. millares et al29 analyzed paired sputum specimens from patients with COPD at baseline and during exacerbations. they found that exacerbations were associated with a selective increase in the relative abundance of bacteria typically associated with exacerbations (eg, Haemophilus, Pseudomonas, and Moraxella) studies are needed to characterize the microbiome during COPD exacerbations. some authors suggest that in stable COPD, virus colonization could play a role in maintaining elevated inflammatory background. a et al.37 study by mallia et al37 shows antibiotics courses and exacerbations in the last year before the enrolment of patients documented. a similar study has been reported by mallia et al:37. 60% of COPD patients experienced a secondary bacterial infection after being infected with rhinovirus. the predominant cause of death was a bacterial superinfection resulting in secondary bacterial pneumonia. the infection increases the susceptibility to bacterial respiratory infections such as S. pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and H. influenzae. the induction of a highly polarized type 1 T helper immune response by respiratory viruses leads to a reduction of MARCO expression. the fine balance of IL-10 production and Th17 response during a viral infection could explain the excessive susceptibility to the bacterial superinfection observed after influenza virus infection. nonrespiratory viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus can change the lung microbiome facilitating colonization by pathogenic gastrointestinal bacteria in infected patients. a et al37 also showed a significant inverse relationship between the forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity ratio and the number of macrophages and neutrophils in the small airways. the relationship between the degree of inflammation and viral load needs to be studied in patients under well-standardized therapeutic conditions. the authors suggested that rhinovirus infection in COPD alters the respiratory microbiome and may induce secondary bacterial infections. there is a parallel increase in the inflammatory response after concomitant bacterial and viral infections in COPD. influenza virus causes apoptosis and alters the function of alveolar macrophages. the macrophages\u2019 reduced production of cytokines and chemokines alters the response of other cells to pathogens. natural killer cells are also affected by influenza virus. frequent exacerbators had higher serum levels of IL-6 and CRP in comparison to infrequent exacerbators. the authors suggested these higher inflammatory indices could be related to the faster forced expiratory volume in 1 second decline. the microbiome in the airways of COPD patients is altered with increasing disease severity, and during the exacerbation process. bacteria and viruses play a pivotal causal role in COPD exacerbations and disease progression."}
