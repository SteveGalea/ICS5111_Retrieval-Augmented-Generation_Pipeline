{"summary": "a total of 186 cases were confirmed, 38 deaths occurred, and 16,693 patients were quarantined. south Korea became the country with the highest number of MERS cases, apart from Saudi Arabia. the government and non-governmental organizations expressed concerns that these cases could turn into a pandemic. the government recommended wearing face masks and handwashing as preventive measures during the outbreak of MERS in 2015. no study has been performed yet investigating to what extent these measures were practiced. the study used the results of two surveys conducted by Gallup Korea in June 2015 during the outbreak. the survey was conducted by trained interviewers using computer assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) the first survey had 1004 respondents with a response rate of 15.5%; the second survey had 1000 respondents with a 17.7% response rate. Variables 2.2.1. Nonpharmaceutical Preventive Behaviors Measures aimed at preventing MERS practiced at the individual level were investigated by dividing them into reducing transmission behaviors and risk avoidance behaviors. respondents classified as metropolitan residents or non-metropolitan residents. political orientation was classified based on support for the president and the political parties. support for the president was assessed using options of \u201capproval\u201d, \u201cdisapproval\u201d or \u201cno opinion\u201d. study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Seoul Metropolitan Government\u2013Seoul National University Boramae Medical Center. the need for informed consent was waived by the board. the second survey assessed risk avoidance behaviors (June 23\u201325th) using the following questions: (a) Did you reduce or avoid outdoor activities or attending meetings this week because of MERS? (b) Did you reduce or avoid using public transportation such as the bus or the subway this week because of MERS? a response of 3\u20134 points was classified as \u201cworried\u201d and a response of 1\u20132 points was classified as \u201cnot worried\u201d. the second survey investigated the respondents\u2019 education levels and predictions regarding the MERS epidemic. political orientation, and anxiety level were also investigated. respondents were classified as metropolitan residents or non-metropolitan residents. support for the president was assessed using options of \"approval\", \"disapproval\" or \"no opinion\" logistic regression analysis was performed to explore factors influencing nonpharmaceutical preventive behaviors. y = 1 was used when one or more reducing transmission or risk avoidance behaviors were practiced, otherwise y = 0 was used. female subjects had higher practice rates of reducing transmission behaviors than male subjects.
