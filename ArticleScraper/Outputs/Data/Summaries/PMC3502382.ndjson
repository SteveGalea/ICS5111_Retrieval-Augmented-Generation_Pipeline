{"summary": "METHODS Sources of data Age-specific weekly deaths from 1998 to 2009 were obtained from the Census and Statistics Department of the Hong Kong Government. we selected 7 of the leading major causes of death in Hong Kong that might potentially be related to influenza. these causes of death included cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, malignant neoplasm, diabetes mellitus, kidney disease, chronic liver disease and degenerative disease of the nervous system. linear regression models were chosen to reflect the assumption that increases in influenza activity would lead to corresponding additive increases in mortality, rather than multiplicative increases. influenza activity was estimated by the weekly proportion of consultations for influenza-like illness at sentinel clinics multiplied by the weekly type/subtype-specific influenza detection rate in the local public health laboratory. the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for excess mortality rates were estimated with a bootstrap approach. to permit comparison with other countries, mortality rates were directly standardized to the World Standard Population [21]. the age-specific midyear population sizes for each year from 1998 through 2009 were obtained from official statistics published by the Census and Statistics Department. the public health laboratory receives specimens for diagnostic and surveillance purposes from sentinel outpatient clinics and local hospitals. sensitivity analyses explored the effect on excess mortality estimates of no lag, or a 2-week lag. influenza-associated excess mortality rates were estimated by subtracting the predicted mortality rate estimated from the fitted regression model based on the reported weekly influenza activity. influenza was associated with an annual excess mortality rate of 11.1 per 100 000 person-years from all causes in 1998\u20132009. the age-standardized mortality rate was 8.5 (95% CI, 5.6\u201311.4) per 100 000 person-years through the period. the annual influenza-associated all-cause mortality rates ranged between 7.4 and 14.4 per 100 000 person-years through the period. influenza activity was estimated by the weekly proportion of consultations for influenza-like illness at sentinel clinics multiplied by the weekly influenza detection rate in the local public health laboratory. influenza seasons were defined as periods of at least 2 consecutive weeks with influenza activity exceeding 0.005 (gray dashed line) sH1N1), B 2.55 (.55, 5.62) 4.27 (2.64, 5.81)...... 3.50 (.73, 7.62) 10.33 (5.53, 14.54) Summer A(sH3N2), A(sH1N1) 0.29 (.06,.64) 1.50 (.92, 2.04)...... 0.09 (.02,.21) 1.88 (1.27, 2.48) 2001 One season A(sH1N1), B 3.85 (.83 1.82 (.38, 3.95) 3.43 (.89, 5.77) Summer A(sH1N1) 2.70 (.59, 5.95) 0.03 (.02,.04) 1.87 (.37, 6.13) 2007 One season A(sH3N2) 0.12 (.03,.26) 9.00 (5.56, 12.25)...... 2.32 (.49, 5.05) 11.43 (6.96, 15.35) 2008 Winter A(sH1N1), B 0.70 influenza A(H1N1) was not detected by local public health laboratory. from 1998 through 2009, the annual excess all-cause mortality rates associated with seasonal influenza A(H3N2), A(H1N1), and B averaged 6.9, 1.6, and 2.5 per 100 000 person-years. influenza was associated with an average of 1.3, 3.3, and 89.7 deaths per 100 000 person-years in younger adults, older adults, and the elderly. Approximately 95% of the influenza-associated excess mortality occurred in the elderly, accounting for 2.6% of all-cause deaths in that age group. 0\u20134 y (95% CI) 5\u201314 y (95% CI) 15\u201344 y (95% CI) 45\u201364 y (95% CI) 65 y (95% CI) All Ages (95% CI) Cardiovascular disease 0.28 (.65, 1.27) 0.03 (.19,.28) 0.09 (.17,.40) 0.85 (.56, 2.35) 18.96 (9.61, 31.18) 0.05 (.63, 3. disease 0.17 (.39,.04) 0.04 (.33,.12) 0.87 (.45, 1.28) 23.01 (17.05, 29.26) 2.62 (1.98, 3.29) Malignant neoplasm 0.45 (1.09,.23) 0.11 (.50,.24) 0.12 (.37,.60) 1.59 (3.69,.29) 9.90 (3.90, 16.15) 0.79 (.12, 1.68) Diabetes mellit influenza-associated excess deaths from these 7 major causes together accounted for 88% (9.71/11.08) of the estimated influenza-associated excess deaths from these 7 major causes together accounted for 88% (9.71/11.08) of the estimated influenza-associated deaths from all causes. associated excess mortality rates for pneumonia and influenza were similar to those for chronic lower respiratory diseases. the negative control used in the model, deaths caused by femoral fracture, was not associated with influenza virus infection. respiratory and cardiovascular diseases are often identified as the 2 most common causes of death associated with influenza virus infections. the contribution of cardiovascular diseases to influenza-associated mortality may be due to the possible relationship between infection and atherosclerosis [23, 24]. winter epidemic tended to have a greater impact on excess mortality than summer epidemic. increased pneumococcal vaccination coverage among elderly could be an effective way to reduce influenza-associated hospitalizations and deaths. a strategy could reduce all-cause deaths in the elderly by as much as 35% [46]. the current model only explained 83% of the variation in the all-cause deaths. other factors such as changes in chronic diseases, epidemics of infectious diseases, or other environmental factors could also affect mortality rates in Hong Kong. the higher influenza-associated mortality in the elderly indicates further improvements in influenza control measures are needed to reduce the impact of this infectious disease in Hong Kong. supplementary data is available at the journal of infectious diseases online."}
