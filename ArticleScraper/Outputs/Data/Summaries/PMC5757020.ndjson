{"summary": "acute rejection of the pulmonary allograft remains a potential cause of acute graft failure. acute rejection is responsible for 3.6% of deaths among adult lung transplant recipients in the first 30 days, and 1.8% in the period from 1 to 12 months post-transplant (1). recipient, immunological and environmental factors predicting ACR are less well studied. ISHLT registry data suggests a protective effect of the interleukin-2 receptor antagonists (basiliximab and daclizumab) when compared to no induction, or the use of alemtuzumab. mechanism of ACR ACR is a response driven by T lymphocytes that recognises foreign major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens. function of MHC is to bind foreign antigenic peptides and display them on the surface of antigen presenting cells for presentation to T cells. the advent of calcineurin inhibitors was a revolutionary advance in this area. effective blockade of T cell activation and proliferation is required to prevent rejection. monary function tests Spirometry is an easily performed, non-invasive, safe and repeatable test, routinely performed at follow-up visits or even by patients themselves at home. a decline in FEV1 of 10% from a stable baseline that persists for more than 48 hours should generally trigger the need for further investigations. the need to make a confident tissue diagnosis of ACR cannot thus be overemphasised. the usual practice is to only biopsy one lung in heart-lung or bilateral lung recipients. transbronchial biopsies are routinely obtained from the lower lobe. trans-bronchial lung biopsies demonstrate different grades of rejection. perivascular inflammation, termed \u201cA-grade\u201d, evaluates presence and extent of mononuclear cell invasion. grades range from A0 (no rejection) to A4 (severe) rejection only after the rigorous exclusion of infection (28,29). other processes that can confound the diagnosis of ACR include drug toxicity, aspiration, ischaemia/reperfusion injury, recurrent primary disease (26). cryobiopsy is a relatively new interventional bronchoscopic technique that yields larger specimens with better representation of airways, alveoli and vascular structures. a recent study of cryobiopsy in lung transplant recipients found more representative specimens, with less crush artefact, and without a higher rate of complications when compared to conventional biopsies. choscopy or clinically-indicated biopsy did not find a difference in acute rejection, the development of CLAD or survival (35). other biomarkers The identification of an objective, repeatable and specific non-invasive test that could replace trans-bronchial biopsy remains an attractive but elusive goal. current practice has also been to use serum drug levels of calcineurin inhibitor as a proxy for the degree of immunosuppression. microRNAs (miRNA) are small non-coding RNA molecules that are critical controllers of post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. miRNA profiles that detect cardiac ACR have been found in peripheral blood, and the potential of miRNA as a blood-based marker of ACR is an exciting future field of study. the cornerstone of treatment for ACR is the steroid pulse. but there are no study data to guide the dose or duration of therapy. most centres advocate pulsed-dose methylprednisolone for 3 days with transition to a tapering oral steroid wean. a third of patients will have at least one episode of treated rejection in the first year after transplantation. acute rejection is responsible for 3.6% of deaths among adult lung transplant recipients in the first 30 days, and 1.8% in the period from 1 to 12 months post-transplant (1). systematic review could not conclusively demonstrate a benefit (8). infections, particularly community-acquired viral infections, may stimulate alloimmune responses and precipitate ACR. non-immunological processes, like reperfusion injury or pulmonary infection may cause non-specific activation of local innate immunity which stimulates acute rejection through mechanisms that have not been completely elucidated. peripheral blood eosinophil count can precede clinically significant ACR in both lung and heart transplants. the differential count can be used to guide diagnosis, with an absolute eosinophil count greater than 0.4109 cells, absolute lymphocyte greater than 1.5109 cells, and a relative basophil count greater than 2% favouring rejection, and a neutrophil count greater than 9109 favouring infection. the presence of bilateral ground-glass opacities with a lower lobe predominance, in association with interlobular septal thickening, had a positive predictive value of 90% for acute rejection (21). a presumptive diagnosis of ACR requires intensification of immunosuppression, which could potentially be hazardous in the presence of an alternative diagnosis, particularly undiagnosed opportunistic infection. the LRSG recommends a minimum of 5 pieces of evaluable, well-expanded alveolar parenchyma to provide adequate sensitivity for diagnosing ACR. a study has shown that this amount can reliably be obtained by performing 10 to 12 biopsy specimens, with a resultant low complication rate. d \u201cB-grade\u201d rejection evaluates the lymphocytic response in the submucosa of bronchioles. the LRSG advises grading both A- and B-grade rejection only after the rigorous exclusion of infection. other processes that can confound the histological diagnosis of ACR include drug toxicity, aspiration, ischaemia/reperfusion injury. sensitivity of trans-bronchial lung biopsy for diagnosing ACR is only 70%. cryobiopsy is a relatively new interventional bronchoscopic technique that yields larger specimens with better representation of airways, alveoli and vascular structures. s for surveillance bronchoscopies vary, but generally involve monthly biopsies in the immediate post-transplant period (when the incidence of ACR is the highest), and continue at less regular intervals for the period from 3 to 12 months after transplant. prospective cohort studies have shown that the incidence of high-grade perivascular or airway inflammation on routine surveillance biopsies is 16% and 14%, respectively (25,34) ddcfDNA is an exciting blood-based biomarker in solid organ transplantation. ddcfDNA levels are associated with both acute and chronic rejection. pulmonary infections also increase FeNO (38,39) some centres will elect not treat in the latter situations, rather repeating the biopsies in 4\u20136 weeks\u2019 time. but considering that minimal rejection has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of CLAD comparable to higher grades of rejection. lymphocytic bronchiolitis (B-grade rejection) has also been shown to be independently associated with increased risk of CLAD and death. the management of persistent or refractory ACR is not well established. failure to respond to treatment for persistent ACR should trigger investigations for concomitant AMR. the first consensus document on pulmonary AMR has been published by the ISHLT. it provides much needed standardisation of the criteria used to define AMR. this document will facilitate universal interpretation of future research. testing ranges from 10\u201361% of patients within 1 year post lung transplant (62-66), and their detection in post-transplant serum is associated with a significantly increased risk of AMR (67-69) and CLAD (62,65,66,68,70-73). pre-formed DSA have also been reported to promote de novo DSA development early after transplant and impact patient survival (64,78,79). non-complement binding and IgG3 and IgG1 bind complement with the former having the strongest affinity to the Fc receptor. all IgG subclasses have the ability to activate complement (81) this may be a case of a \u201cwolf in sheep\u2019s clothing\u201d where DSA that may previously have been considered relatively benign can become pathogenic depending on changes within immunological environment such as inflammatory responses to certain triggers. resulting local inflammatory response exposes SAGs such as Col-V and K1T. second \u2018hit\u2019 is a result of down-regulation of regulatory T cells. this loss of inhibition of self-reactive lymphocytes against SAGs. this ultimately leads to SAG autoimmunity Bharat (91,93) pathophysiology of AMR (67-69) and CLAD (62,65,66,69-72) is considered the \u2018gold standard\u2019 for diagnosis of ACR. the appearance of \u2018capillary injury\u2019 with neutrophil margination, neutrophil capillaritis, and arteritis are considered by pathologists to be suggestive of AMR. pulmonary AMR is rarely seen in patients with a diagnosis of pulmonary AMR based on other criteria (26,100), and there is poor inter-pathologist agreement when it comes to recognising a positive stain on trans-bronchial biopsy (101). notably, C4d is not specific to pulmonary AMR, can be found in any process that is associated with complement activation such as reperfusion injury and infection (86). studies have shown no little or correlation between positive staining and the presence acute AMR can occur at any time after transplantation (104) a more chronic and indolent form for AMR is thought to contribute to the development of CLAD due to BOS or even r-CLAD. there are insufficient data to confirm this association (97) trans-bronchial biopsy is undertaken as the \u2018gold standard\u2019 in diagnosing ACR. serology for the detection of DSA using SAB is also requested. the identification of DSA has evolved over time from the provision of a rather crude measure of the presence of DSA. a mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) represents the amount of fluoro-labelled anti-IgG in complex with anti-HLA antibody. the MFI is not an accurate quantitative measurement of the amount of antibody concentration which requires measurement of the antibody titre (108-110) some studies using low MFI thresholds showed no negative effect on transplant outcome with pre-existing DSA (62,111) some studies have shown that HLA class II antibodies may be more significant than HLA Class I antibodies (73,112) patients who develop class II DSA or have persistent DSA despite antibody-depleting therapy have worse long term outcomes after transplantation. classification of AMR AMR is classified into clinical and sub-clinical AMR. clinical AMR indicates that there is allograft dysfunction. subclinical AMR is then sub-classified into definite, probable and possible AMR. X, absent; O, present. AMR, antibody-mediated rejection; DSA, donor-specific antibodies. adapted from 2016 pulmonary AMR consensus document of the ISHLT. IVIG causes B-cell apoptosis, reduces B-cell numbers, blocks binding of donor reactive antibodies and may inhibit complement activation (122). bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor that reduces DSA by depleting plasma cells by causing plasma cell apoptosis. ung transplantation is unique to other solid organs in that it is open to the environment and undergoes continuous stimulus from infectious and non-infectious stimuli. current immunosuppression strategies targeting the T-cell responses do not seem to control CLAD."}
