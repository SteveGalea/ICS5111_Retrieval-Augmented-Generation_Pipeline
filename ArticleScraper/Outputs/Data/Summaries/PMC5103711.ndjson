{"summary": "the lack of effective therapy for ONFH is a difficulty that needs to be overcome in clinical practice. previous studies have described the use of mesenchymal stem cells to promote local bone repair and healing (5,6) we implanted HIF-1 transgenic MSCs into the necrotic area of the femoral head. this treatment resulted in improved osteogenic and angiogenic capacity in vitro and in vivo. however, the risks of lentivirus vectors, such as tumorigenesis (20, should be seriously considered before clinical application. adipose tissues were harvested and digested with 0.1% collagenase I (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h. the complex was filtered with a 100-m nylon mesh. cells were then resuspended with modified Eagle's medium. the protein concentration was measured using a bicinchoninic protein assay kit. proteins (10 g) from each sample were then separated using 12% SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA) they were then blocked in 5% non-fat milk at room temperature for 1 h. the rabbits with early-stage ONFH were randomly divided into four groups. group I (n=11) did not receive any therapy. group III (n=11) only received core decompression of the femoral head. group IV (n=11) received core decompression and normal ASC transplantation. a drill with an diameter of 1 mm was inserted at the flare of the greater trochanter and into the necrotic area of the femoral head. the necrotic tissue was then removed completely, and the cell-hydrogel composites were transplanted into the necrotic area through the bone tunnel made by drill for Groups III and IV. animals received gentamicin intramuscularly as prophylaxis for 3 days. micro-CT scan performed using a micro-CT scanner (SkyScan 1076; Bruker micro-CT, Kontich, Belgium) sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and observed under a light microscope. image-Pro Plus 6.0 software was used to evaluate new bone formation at 100 magnification in six randomly selected fields per section. animals were kept in single cages at a controlled temperature (15\u201325\u00b0C) under a 12-h light/dark cycle and fed with a standard diet. animals were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (3 mg/100 g; Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) the cells were seeded on six-well plates at 3105 cells/well and regular medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum) after 1, 3 and 7 days, total protein was harvested from the cultured cells according to standard protocols. the transplanted composite was prepared by mixing cells with the hydrogels according to the manufacturer's protocol. in brief, 1107 ASCs were suspended in 1 ml sucrose solution (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.) the cell suspension was mixed with the hydrogels in an equal volume and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. rabbits with early-stage ONFH were randomly divided into four groups. group I (n=11) did not receive any therapy and served as controls. group III (n=11) only received core decompression of the femoral head. group IV (n=11) received core decompression and normal ASC transplantation. a silicone injection compound (MICROFIL MV-122; Flow Tech, Inc., Carver, MA, USA) was injected into the vasculature. the animals were then stored at 4\u00b0C to ensure polymerization of the contrast agent. after 1 h, the proximal parts of the femurs were harvested and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. the vessels were included at each two-dimensional section by built-in \u2018Contouring Program\u2019 for automatic reconstruction of three-dimensional images. the axial slices through the samples were visualized, and the volume of the vessels in the necrotic area was calculated. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software, version 12.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) Animals Healthy New Zealand rabbits weighing 2.5\u20133 kg and aged 2\u20133 months were provided by the Experimental Animal Centre of Shanghai Jiao Tong University affiliated Sixth People's Hospital (Shanghai, China) the cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. the culture medium was replaced every 3 days, and non-adherent cells were removed. the cells of four to six passages were used for the following experiments. primary antibodies against HIF-1 (1:800; ab1; abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) were added to incubate with the membranes at 4\u00b0C overnight. infrared-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:10,000; ab97040; Abcam) were added to incubate with the membranes for 1 h at room temperature. rabbits with early-stage ONFH were randomly divided into four groups. one injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 10 g/kg; Sigma-Aldrich) was administered intravenously at day 1, then three injections of methylprednisolone (MPS; 20 mg/kg; Pfizer, Inc., New York, NY, USA) were administered intramuscularly at days 2, 3 and 4. animals received gentamicin (80 MU/day; Shanghai no.1 Biochemical & Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) intramuscularly as prophylaxis for 3 days. four weeks after the surgery, animals were anesthetized with intravenous pentobarbital. the necrotic area of the femoral head was selected as the region of interest (ROI) with the aid of preoperative MRI. the parameters of bone volume/total volume (BV/TV) and bone mineral density (BMD) of ROI were calculated, which indicated the bone regeneration of the necrotic area. samples were then decalcified with 10% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid at 37\u00b0C for 3 weeks. immunohistochemistry was performed using antibodies specific for CD31 (1:200; ab24590; Abcam) and HIF-1 (1:100; ab8366; Abcam) sections were rehydrated and incubated with primary antibodies at 4\u00b0C overnight, then incubated with biotinylated secondary IgGs (1:500; BA1001; Wuhan Boster Biological Technology, Ltd., Wuhan, China) Western blot analysis showed that DMOG increased the protein levels of HIF-1 in ASCs in a dose-dependent manner at least for 7 days. DMOG, dimethyloxalylglycine; ASCs, adipose-derived stem cells; HIF-1, hypoxia inducible factor-1. micro-CT images of the femoral head taken 4 weeks after cell implantation. BMD and BV/TV of the necrotic area in Group IV was significantly higher than in the other three groups (*P0.05). reconstructed three dimensional images showed the morphology of regenerated vessels in the necrotic area. in group I, there was nearly no vascular architecture in the necrotic area. in group II, only some blood vessels were observed. HIF-1 expression in ASCs in vivo Immunohistochemistry for HIF-1 was performed to evaluate HIF-1 expression in ASCs in vivo. positive cells were apparent in group IV, which indicated sustained release of DMOG could enhance expression of HIF-1 in ASCs in vivo. otic area Bone regeneration in the necrotic area of each group was initially analyzed using micro-CT scanning. the samples of group I, which received no treatment, showed few destroyed trabeculae in the necrotic area of the femoral head. in group II, there was less granulation tissue and fewer fat cells in the necrotic area. in group III, there was some disordered trabecular tissue in the necrotic area. in group IV, there was substantial trabecular tissue, and large osteocytes were distributed along the trabeculae. immunohistochemistry for CD31 was performed to evaluate newly formed vessels in the necrotic area of Group IV. blood vessels were defined with positive CD31 stain and their typical round or oval structure. results showed more vessels in Group IV than the other three groups. Western blot analysis was performed to detect the protein expression of HIF-1 in rabbit ASCs treated with different concentrations of DMOG. the data showed the expression of HIF-1 protein was increased in response to DMOG treatment in a dose-dependent manner. after treatment for 1 day, the levels of HIF-1 protein in cells respectively increased by 2-, 4- and 5-fold. the trabeculae in the necrotic area appeared intact and well distributed. quantitative analysis indicated nearly no new bone formation in the necrotic area of Group I. in group III, there were numerous fat cells and rare trabecular tissue. histomorphometric analysis confirmed that new bone in Group IV was more than that of other three groups. reconstructed three dimensional images showed the morphology of regenerated vessels in the necrotic area. micro-CT reconstructed three-dimensional microangiography of the necrotic area in groups (A) I, (B) II, (C) III and (D) IV. core decompression is reported to be effective for early-stage ONFH. it acts to reverse the natural process of ONFH by providing a conduit for angiogenesis to revascularize subchondral bone and reducing elevated intraosseous pressures. however, the majority of studies about the effectiveness of core decompression suggest that the results of this approach are not satisfactory. previous study showed that HIF-1 transgenic MSCs had improved osteogenic and angiogenic capacity in vitro and better potential to promote bone regeneration in the necrotic area of the femoral head. however, the risks of gene transduction, such as tumorigenesis and permanent overexpression of the transduced gene, limited its clinical application. an animal model of steroid-induced ONFH is important for evaluation of the effects of various methods of treating ONFH. it has been reported that this inductive protocol has a high incidence of ONFH, and resulted in nearly no death. the steroid-induced rabbit model may be effective for testing the efficacy of the method developed for treatment of steroid-associated ONFH. DMOG-treated ASCs markedly increased vascularization and bone regeneration in the necrotic area of the femoral head in ONFH rabbits. findings suggest that DMOG could enhance the osteogenic activity of ASCs in vivo, and therefore provide a novel therapeutic option for early-stage corticosteroid-induced ONFH."}
