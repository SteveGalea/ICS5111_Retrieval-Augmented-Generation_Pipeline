{"summary": "pandemic and trivalent 2009-2010 seasonal vaccines were effective in preventing influenza-like illness (ILI) during the 2009 A(H1N1) pandemic in france. we also compare vaccine effectiveness against ILI versus laboratory-confirmed pandemic A(H1N1) influenza. valent 2009-2010 seasonal vaccines had a statistically significant effectiveness in preventing ILI and confirmed pandemic influenza. but they were not better in preventing confirmed pandemic influenza than in preventing ILI. this lack of difference might be indicative of selection bias. adults over 18 year-old without a risk factor were called in week 53. 63,295,000 people had been called to vaccination centers to receive a pandemic influenza vaccine. pandemic vaccination targeted different at-risk groups, which were called in turn. in the first weeks of the pandemic, the sharpest increase in ILI incidence was observed in children under five year-old. the biggest difference between age-specific incidence rates was observed at the peak of the epidemic. adults over 65 year-old were almost unaffected by the pandemic wave in France. influenza vaccines were not given to children under six months-old. individuals with missing age or vaccination status were also excluded. study period began three weeks after start of vaccination campaign. corsican Sentinelles GPs swabbed patients presenting with ILI. the viral strain was known for laboratory-confirmed influenza cases. gps swabbed patients presenting with acute respiratory infection. w, for age group g, was calculated as: with the number of people in age group g vaccinated with the pandemic vaccine before or during week w, and popg the population size of age group g in 2009 in france. the database contained all people vaccinated with a pandemic vaccine, so that no random fluctuation was present. a similar database was not maintained by the national health insurance. the predicted coverage of seasonal vaccines and co-vaccinations, were constrained to remain stable respectively from week 5 and week 11 of 2010. in practice, for pandemic and seasonal influenza vaccines, individuals were considered vaccinated for more than three weeks at week t. trivalent 2009\u20132010 seasonal vaccines were expected to be less specific of 2009 A(H1N1) than pandemic vaccines. effectiveness of the seasonal vaccines was calculated only using individuals that did not receive pandemic vaccination. if only 50% of ILI cases are caused by influenza, a hundred percent effective influenza vaccine will have at most 50% effectiveness in preventing ILI. influenza vaccine effectiveness in preventing ILI should be null outside the influenza-circulation period, if no bias was present. we therefore calculated VE against laboratory-confirmed A(H1N1) influenza outside the influenza-circulating period. corsican laboratory-confirmed influenza cases were reported by Sentinelles GPs. swabs were collected through a randomized selection routine. only patients presenting between 0 and 7 days after symptom onset were swabbed. the viral strain was known for laboratory-confirmed influenza cases. pandemic vaccine coverage at week w, for age group g, was calculated as: with the number of people in age group g vaccinated with the pandemic vaccine before or during week w. data show that very few pandemic vaccinations were completed after winter. weekly coverage of seasonal vaccines was calculated as: Estimation of field vaccine effectiveness. age was divided into nine strata (6 month- to 4 year-old, 5\u201314, 15\u201324, 25\u201334, 35\u201349, 50\u201364, 65\u201369, 70\u201374 and 75 year-old) if only 50% of ILI cases are caused by influenza, a hundred percent effective influenza vaccine will have at most 50% effectiveness in preventing ILI. if only 50% of ILI cases are caused by influenza, a hundred percent effective influenza vaccine will have at most 50% effectiveness in preventing ILI. vaccinated with influenza vaccine consulted differently than the rest of the population for an influenza episode. this could be a confusion factor when estimating VE. influenza vaccine effectiveness in preventing ILI should be null outside the influenza-circulation period, if no bias was present. 67% (29/43) of the 6 month- to 4 year-old ILI cases were vaccinated in the three weeks preceding the pandemic. none of the two vaccinated ILI cases 65 year-old reported by Sentinelles GPs during the pandemic had been vaccinated for more than three weeks. most cases aged15 year-old and over received the Pandemrix\u00ae vaccine (43/71 i.e. 61%); four had the Panenza\u00ae most cases received one dose of vaccine (154/172 i.e. 90%) eight cases received two doses of vaccines: three children below 15 year-old and five 35 to 64 year-old adults. seasonal vaccines for the purpose of estimating the effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccines, 9564 cases were eligible. the GROG and Sentinelles samples provided 838 laboratory-confirmed pandemic A(H1N1) influenza cases 6 month-old that were described for pandemic vaccination and age. we did not include those influenza isolates that were not typed (18), were of not-subtyped type A (26), or were of subtype A(H3N2) (one) no B strain was present in the sample. the pandemrix\u00ae vaccine was done in the three weeks preceding the consultation for 20 of the 25 vaccinated cases (80%), before that delay for two cases (8%), or at an unknown date for three of them (12%). 87 percent (11/13) of the 6 month- to 4 year-old laboratory-confirmed cases were vaccinated in the three weeks preceding the consultation. all confirmed pandemic A(H1N1) cases 65 year-old included in the study had received the seasonal vaccine. five (10%) of the cases vaccinated with a seasonal vaccine had also received a pandemic vaccine, while 43 (84%) had not. all vaccinees are considered vaccinated, regardless of the injection date 6 m\u20134 y 53 (36\u201366) 5\u201314 59 (46\u201370) 15\u201364 49 (33\u201362) 65 30 (124\u201388) All ages 54 (45\u201361) ILI, post-epidemic period Vaccinated for 3 weeks or at an unknown date are considered unvaccinated. 4 y 44 (4\u201370) 5\u201314 44 (4\u201373) 15\u201364 69 (19\u201392) All ages 49 (25\u201367) Table 6.

Sentinelles GPs reported 7586 ILI cases above 6 month-old. information on age and pandemic vaccine status included in pandemic vaccines analysis. 172 (2%) were vaccinated. 67% of the 6 month- to 4 year-old ILI cases were vaccinated in the three weeks preceding the consultation. none of the two vaccinated cases 65 year-old reported by Sentinelles GPs during the pandemic had been vaccinated for more than three weeks. most cases aged15 year-old and over received the Pandemrix\u00ae vaccine (43/71 i.e. 61%); four had the Panenza\u00ae, four the Q-Pan H vaccination had been done in the three weeks preceding the consultation for 115 cases (21%), more than three weeks before consultation for 401 cases (74%), or at an unknown date for 24 of them. sixty-one of them (11%) were also vaccinated with the pandemic vaccine, while 465 (86%) were not, the remaining 14 patients having not answered the pandemic vaccination question. none of the five confirmed A(H1N1) cases aged 65 year-old had received a pandemic vaccine. four of the nine vaccinated children between five and fourteen year-old were given the Panenza\u00ae vaccine (44%); three receive the Pandemrix\u00ae vaccine (33%); two received a pandemic vaccine of unknown brand. 4 year-old laboratory-confirmed cases were vaccinated in the three weeks preceding the consultation for 10 of the vaccinated cases (20%). all confirmed pandemic A(H1N1) cases 65 year-old included in the study had received the seasonal vaccine. laboratory-confirmed pandemic A(H1N1) influenza cases 6 month-old were described for pandemic vaccination and age. we did not include those influenza isolates that were not typed (18), were of not-subtyped type A (26), or were of subtype A(H3N2) (one) no B strain was present in the sample. twenty-five of the included A(H1N1) cases were vaccinated (3%) vaccination had been done in the three weeks preceding the consultation for 20 of the 25 vaccinated cases (80%), before that delay for two cases (8%), or at an unknown date for three of them (12%). eighty-five percent (11/13) of the 6 month- to 4 year-old laboratory-confirmed cases were vaccinated in the three weeks preceding the consultation. all confirmed pandemic A(H1N1) cases 65 year-old included in the study had received the seasonal vaccine. five (10%) of the cases vaccinated with a seasonal vaccine had also received a pandemic vaccine. 43 (84%) had not received the seasonal vaccine. 5\u201314 59 (46\u201370) 15\u201364 49 (33\u201362) 65 30 (124\u201388) All ages 54 (45\u201361) ILI, post-epidemic period Vaccinated for 3 weeks or at an unknown date are considered unvaccinated. 6 m\u20134 y 56 (2\u201385) 5\u201314 28 (45\u201370) 15\u201364 11 (38\u201347) 65 100 \u2013 All ages 31 (1\u201353) All vaccinees are considered pandemic vaccine recipients Including pandemic vaccine recipients Age group FVE (%) 95% CI FVE (%) 95% CI ILI, epidemic period Vaccinated for 3 weeks or at an unknown date are considered unvaccinated.

Adjustments We adjusted by age to take into account different vaccine responses with age. the results are in accordance with the theoretical principle which stipulates that as the specificity of the outcome decreases, so should the measured vaccine effectiveness [14]\u2013[16]. a few studies have used ILI as an endpoint for evaluating influenza vaccine effectiveness on the field [38]\u2013[41], although laboratory-confirmed influenza is a more common endpoint. orenstein et al demonstrated that poorly sensitive outcomes could lead to underestimation of field vaccine effectiveness in three different observational designs [16]. a cross-sectional survey at GPs offices will be carried out to assess the vaccine coverage among Sentinelles GPs patients. a case-control study conducted in seven european countries found VE = 72% [8], [23] and above the VE found by a Korean study. however, they are below the estimates from a Scottish cohort study (95%) [25], a german study based on the screening method (83\u201397%) [26] and a Canadian test-negative incident case-control study (>90%) [7]. seasonal vaccines were not significantly better in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza: VE = 60% (41\u201374) versus VE = 61% (56\u201366). seasonal vaccines were not significantly better in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza: VE = 60% (41\u201374) versus VE = 61% (56\u201366). in a literature review by Viboud et al, four studies of the 2008\u20132009 seasonal vaccines found no protection against 2009 pandemic A(H1N1) influenza. a subsequent paper evidenced a moderate effectiveness of the 2008\u20132009 seasonal vaccines against pandemic A(H1N1) mild outcomes (VE = 42%, 29\u201353%). pandemic VE was not calculated by vaccine trademark. we used a three week delay between vaccination and consultation to differentiate vaccinated influenza cases fully immunized from those still unprotected. we do observe a lower effectiveness of pandemic vaccines in preventing ILI after the epidemic period (VE = 33%, 4\u201355) unlike in Nichol et al, the effectiveness remains significantly above zero. asymptomatic cases, subclinical cases and presentations different from the chosen definition are missed. vaccine effectiveness against ILI was computed after the influenza circulation period. effect of pandemic vaccine during this period was significantly above zero (33%, 4\u201357), although not significant in most age subgroups except in the six to fourteen year-old group. we do observe a lower effectiveness of pandemic vaccines in preventing ILI after the epidemic period. however, unlike in Nichol et al, the effectiveness remains significantly above zero. asymptomatic cases, subclinical cases and presentations different from the chosen ILI definition are missed. effectiveness of pandemic vaccine during this period was significantly above zero (33%, 4\u201357), although not significant in most age subgroups except in the six to fourteen year-old group."}
