{"summary": "2B proteins of poliovirus, coxsackievirus, and other picornaviruses (PVs) have been extensively studied. the predicted structure of FMDV 2B contains two hydrophobic regions and inserts itself into the membrane of the ER with its N and C termini oriented toward the cytosol. the predicted structure of FMDV 2B contains two hydrophobic regions. 2B is encoded within a tract of 462 nucleotides of the FMDV genome. it has one of the lowest percentages of nucleotide substitutions. only 39% of nucleotide positions and 24% of amino acids can tolerate some change. FMDV 2B is a 154-amino-acid protein containing 117 invariant residues. a similarity of sequences for the 2B protein across all genotypes suggests its structure and base composition have a critical and specific role in the process of virus replication. residues in red are changes from the original amino acid sequence. residues in red are changes from the original amino acid sequence. 850 s CH2

membrane permeability measurements investigating its pore formation mechanisms had not yet been performed. results presented in Fig. 2 describe the ion channel activity of the FMDV 2B peptides. current recordings measured in 150 mM CaCl2 at 50 mV. traces showing \u201copening\u201d and \u201cclosing\u201d events were observed for planar bilayers treated with 2B2 or 2B4. this pattern of changes in conductance was unaffected when an equimolar 2B2-2B4 mixture was added. a single-vesicle approach based on the use of ER-GUVs compare untreated ER-GUVs (negative control) with those treated with the pore domain of classical swine fever virus viroporin p7 (p7C) (positive control) (11) or the different FMDV 2B peptides. negative-control vesicles and those treated with the 2B1(28\u201356) or 2B3(79\u2013106) peptid bars represent the degree of filling of individual ER-GUVs with Alexa Fluor 488 (dark green) and Alexa Fluor 647 (light green) after a 4-h incubation with the 2B peptides. er-GUVs treated with the 2B2(55\u201382) or 2B4(99\u2013147) peptide mostly showed levels of permeabilization approaching 100%. pore stability assays showed that ER-GUVs remain in a permeabilized state after the first permeabilization event has occurred. peptide 2B4c(119\u2013147) possesses channel activity with characteristics similar to those of the complete 2B4(99\u2013147) sequence.

recorded with incident light polarized parallel () and perpendicular () to the membrane normal. a panel of 13 cDNA constructs containing the desired amino acid substitutions was designed to assess the importance of the integrity of the area between amino acid residues 28 and 147 of 2B. a total of 13 cDNA constructs containing the desired amino acid substitutions were designed in the context of a full-length cDNA, pO1C, covering the amino acid residues described in Table 2. ected with construct 83P showed the presence of cytopathic effect by the fifth blind passage. description of amino acid

cells transfected with the pO1C (wild-type) construct continued to be detected with each successive cell passage. the presence of virus RNA was detected by real-time RT-PCR. transfected cells were assessed by immunocytochemistry using the same monoclonal antibody. no 2B expression could be detected in any of the 5 blind passages of any of the other 12 infectious clone constructs harboring mutations in 2B. current recordings in 150 mM KCl, at a potential of 50 mV, after addition to ER-like lipid bilayers of 2B2 or 2B4 peptide variants incorporating the mutations. micrographs illustrate individual cells coexpressing several GFP constructs and the ER marker mCh-Sec61. mutants 2B.1, 2B.3, 2B.11 and 2B.13 colocalized with ER marker mCh-Sec61 beta in 293T cells. mutants 2B.2, 2B.2 and 2B.12 targeting 2B2 and 2B4 areas, respectively, colocalized with Sec61 to the same extent, suggesting the correct insertion of these transmembrane variants into the ER membrane. cells were

vesicles. results presented in Fig. 2 describe the ion channel activity of the FMDV 2B peptides assayed in planar lipid mixtures. open channels were recorded in the cases of the peptides 2B2 and 2B4, spanning residues 55 to 82 and 99 to 147. the most frequent events corresponded to single-channel currents of 7 4 and 5 3 pA for 2B2(55\u201382) and 2B4(99\u2013147), respectively. this pattern of changes in conductance was unaffected when an equimolar 2B2-2B4 mixture was added to the supported bilayers. in principle, channels formed under these conditions should permit the simultaneous transport of water molecules, solvated ions, and even small solutes. incubation with positive control p7C, 2B2(55\u201382) or 2B4(99\u2013147) resulted in green labeling of internal ER-GUV compartments. results confirm pore-forming activity of 2B2(55\u201382) and 2B4(99\u2013147) sequences, which evolve according to a mechanism that preserves the integrity of the lipid bilayer. the presence of both probes inside vesicles can be observed in the merged images. the \u201cControl\u201d panel displays an intact vesicle incubated in the absence of peptide. the level of permeabilization (percentage) of a single ER-GUV could be further determined by analyzing the balance of fluorescence intensities inside and outside the vesicle. second dye clearly indicates that most ER-GUVs remain in a permeabilized state after the first permeabilization event has occurred. the design of the 2B4(99\u2013147) sequence, with an approximate length of 50 amino acids, was performed with the consideration that we did not expect to observe pore activity in this region. micrographs of ER-GUVs treated with 2B4-derived peptides (C) and their distributions (D) according to the percentage of permeabilization per vesicle. conditions are otherwise described in the legend of Fig. 3. models considering single, continuous helices are accompanied by models considering kinked helical structures. the spectra of 2B1, 2B2, 2B4, and 2B4c in the amide I region showed single peaks at ca. 1,656 cm1 compatible with the adoption of a helical conformation for the inserted peptides. potential infectious RNAs were in vitro transcribed from each of the cDNA constructs. all transfected cell cultures were further blind passaged six times. the presence of FMDV cytopathic effect was first detected. 79RSKDP83 79AAAAA83 79RSKDP83 79RS80 79AA80 79RS80 83P 83A 83P Helix 2 (84\u2013104) 89ML90 89AA90 89ML90 92DTG94 92DTG94 99DSTF102 99AAAA102 92N/96Q/99N 92Lys/96Lys/99Lys 92N/96Q/99N Helix 3 total RNA was isolated from either transfected BHK-21 cells or LFBK-V6 cells used for the third (p.3) and sixth (p.6) blind passages of transfected extracts. data are expressed as CT (cycle threshold) values for all infectious clone constructs described in Table 2. expression of nonstructural protein 2B in cells transfected with different infectious clone constructs was assessed by Western blotting. a reversion to the native sequence took place in the virus isolated in the fifth blind passage of cells transfected with the 83P construct. results confirm that amino acid substitutions in areas of 2B previously characterized as being critical for mediating membrane interactions are also important for virus replication. control GFP labeled the complete cell but was excluded from the ER. GFP-2B constructs were excluded from the nucleus and colocalized with mCh-Sec61. bars represent mean values standard errors (SEs) thapsigargin-induced calcium release from the ER was significantly reduced. compared to cells expressing GFP-2B.12, 2B.2-expressing cells showed an intermediate effect. thapsigargin-induced calcium release from the ER was significantly reduced. mutations RLSxAAA and GLxAA targeting midway residues of helices 1 and 3 interfered with the 2B viroporin function. this can be due to the fact that the mean free energy for transfer and the tendency for adopting a defined helical structure were not affected by the Ala residues in these positions. the observation of a -like extended structure for the sequence spanning residues 79 to 106 may reflect a structure similar to that adopted in the context of the complete protein. this may reflect a structure similar to that adopted in the context of the complete protein or be consistent with the inability of this sequence to penetrate the core of the acyl chains when disconnected from the preceding transmembrane helix 1 (15, 16) transmembrane helix 2 (H2) and helix 3 (H3) would be connected through an amphipathic short helix. the second model assumes that the N- and C-terminal ends of the 2B protein are oriented toward the cytosol. the presence of a structural motif found in other 2B proteins of picornaviruses seems to favor the first model. the insertion of helix 3 does not occur until a time after the proteolytic cleavage that generates 2B and 2C products. it could be speculated that the release of a free C terminus after proteolytic processing could allow the insertion of helix 3 at some stage posttranslationally and concomitant with the formation of an oligomeric pore. mutations in the infectious clone disrupting critical areas in either of these pore-forming regions were nonviable. this could explain the observation that FMDV 2B proteins contain an insertion and are larger than related enterovirus 2B proteins. previous studies have shown that in the same virus, two separate individual proteins both form pores. pnI to leave only the newly amplified plasmid, transformed into XL10-Gold ultracompetent cells, and grown on Terrific Broth plates containing ampicillin. the obtained full-length infectious clones were completely sequenced with FMDV-specific primers by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (25). EPES with KCl (pH 7.4) at both sides of Teflon chambers partitioned by a 15-m-thick Teflon film with 70- to 100-m-diameter orifices. lipid bilayers formed by a monolayer apposition on the orifices previously treated with a 1% solution of hexadecane in pentane. 60 recordings comprising 10 traces with a duration of 20 s were analyzed for each histogram. the data were normalized to a value of 1, using the number of events in each case. the fluorescence intensity value outside the vesicle is considered 100%. the intensity inside vesicles reflected the degree of dye diffusion of the percentage of probe entry into the vesicle lumen. the entry of both probes into vesicles was analyzed in pictures taken after an additional 2-h incubation. 293T cells (2 105 cells) were cotransfected with plasmids encoding GFP fusions and mCh-Sec61 beta (1 g each) using calcium phosphate (32) at 36 h posttransfection, cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with Hoechst dye. tries to produce genetically modified viruses were performed by transfecting BHK-21 cells (ATCC CCL-10) with in vitro-transcribed RNA by electroporation. 0.5 ml of BHK-21 cells at a concentration of 1.5 107 cells/ml in PBS was mixed with 10 g of RNA in a 4-mm-gap BTX cuvette. cells were then pulsed once (330 V with infinite resistance and a capacitance of 1,000 F) samples were harvested using radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer and the NuPAGE LDS sample buffer system (Invitrogen) they were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. vRNA was detected by real-time reverse transcription-PCR (rRT-PCR) on the ABI 7500 system. full-length pO1Ca was used as a template in which native amino acids were substituted by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit. the full-length plasmid was amplified by PCR, digested with DpnI to leave only the newly amplified plasmid. the obtained full-length infectious clones were completely sequenced with FMDV-specific primers. two lipid monolayers were made from pentane solutions of a lipid mixture. they were buffered with 5 mM HEPES with KCl (pH 7.4) at both sides of Teflon chambers partitioned by a 15-m-thick Teflon film. an in-line low-pass Bessel filter at 10 kHz and directly saved into the computer memory with a sampling frequency of 50 kHz. the membrane chamber and the head stage were isolated from external noise sources with a double metal screen. the current jump amplitude analysis was performed using Clampfit 10.6 software. fluorescence microscopy images of individual GUVs were obtained using a commercial Nikon D Eclipse TE2000-U fluorescence microscope (Nikon Instruments, Tokyo, Japan) Extents of permeabilization were calculated for each vesicle after 2 h of incubation with Alexa Fluor 488 and 2B peptides. the entry of both probes into vesicles was quantitated after image processing. a total of 150 IR spectra were collected under each condition. the dichroic ratio of the amide I bond absorption was computed for parallel (0\u00b0) versus perpendicular (90\u00b0) polarized incident light relative to the membrane normal. argin was added at a final concentration of 10 M in culture. time-lapse images of cells displaying 2B-GFP expression levels comparable to those of GFP controls were collected on a Nikon d-Eclipse C1 Si digital camera. pO1C or its mutant versions were linearized at the EcoRV site. FMDV 2B was detected with a monoclonal antibody specifically developed for this work. transfected BHK-21 cells or infected LFBK-V6 cells were harvested using radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer. western immunoblots were visualized using a superSignal West Dura extended-duration substrate. protein 3D (38)."}
