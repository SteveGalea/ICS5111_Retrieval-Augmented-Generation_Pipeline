{"summary": "in 2003, a reassorted H1N2 swine influenza virus subtype appeared and became prevalent in swine. the reassortant H1N2 subtype was characterised genetically and the infection dynamics compared to an \u201cavian-like\u201d H1N1 virus by an experimental infection study. the reassorted \u201cavian-like\u201d H1N2 subtype is a reassortant between circulating swine \u201cavian-like\u201d H1N1 and H3N2. the Danish H1N2 has an \u201cavian-like\u201d H1 and differs from most other reported H1N2 viruses. European H3N2 SIV are human-avian reassortants retaining the HA and NA genes from human H3N2 virus. the remaining gene segments originate from \u201cavian-like\u201d H1N1 SIV [6]. H1N2, which is the most recently recognized new European SIV subtype, was first reported from Great Britain in 1995 [7] \u201cavian-like\u201d H1 has been reported previously from france and Italy. the reassorted \u201cavian-like\u201d H1N2 subtype was first recognized in a lung tissue sample from a pig with coughing, fever and panting. the detected virus (A/swine/Denmark/12687/2003(H1N2) had an \u201cavian-like\u201d H1, and this reassorted H1N2 subtype has since been detected from lung tissue and the identity of the HA gene between the Danish H1N2 viruses and the reference virus A/swine/Scotland/410440/1994(H1N2) and contemporary European human-like H1N2 viruses from Germany was 73%. the nucleotide sequence comparisons of all gene segments are shown in Table 3 and phylogenetic trees for the internal genes are shown in Figure 3. enmark/13608/2004(H1N2) had a very high nucleotide identity (HA gene 96%, NA gene 96%) to H1N2 reassortant viruses detected in 2009 and 2010. seven N-glycosylation sites were predicted for A/swine/Denmark/13608/2004(H1N2) in the HA protein, whereas only 4 sites were predicted in A/swine/Denmark/12687/2003(H s of the Danish H1N2 viruses showed no indication of resistance to NA-inhibitors. all the Danish M sequences deduced resistance against amantadine.

N1 followed by H1N2, group 2: H1N2 followed by H1N1 showed haptoglobin and CRP responses following each of the inoculations, peaking on PID 4 and 35 (group 1) or 4 and 39 (group 2). no SAA response was seen for group 2 after the H1N2 infection. results from the HI-test using A/swine/Denmark/19126/1993 (H1N1) as antigen. stapled lines indicate day of inoculation respectively post infection day (PID) 0 and PID 28. group 1 pigs (1\u20136) were reinoculated post inoculation (PID) 0 with A/swine/Denmark/19126/1993 (H1N1) and reinoculated PID 28 with A/swine/Denmark/10074/2004 (H1N2).

Neighbour Joining trees were calculated with a bootstrap value of 1000. pigs were randomly divided into two groups of 6 pigs, denoted group 1 and group 2. two pigs were euthanized on PID 4 with a titer of 105.9 TCID50 per ml. the remaining four pigs were re-inoculated with 4 ml of A/swine/Denmark/10074/2004 (H1N2). the experimental design was similar except that the pigs were inoculated on PID 0 with the H1N2 isolate. samples taken on PID 0 and 28 were collected prior to inoculation. at post mortem, samples were collected and frozen at -80\u00b0C. study was carried out in strict accordance with the Danish legislation on animal experiments. cross-reactivity of the anti human CRP antibody with porcine CRP was demonstrated. the detection limit was 1416 ng/mL (human equivalents) chicken erythrocytes were used as standard blood cells. a 1% suspension of erythrocytes in PBS with 0.005% gelatine was used. RNA purification RNA was purified from nasal swabs and lung tissue samples. the amplification temperature profile was 50\u00b0C for 30 min for reverse transcription followed by 95\u00b0C for 15 min and 45 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 20 s, 60\u00b0C for 20 s and 72\u00b0C for 30 s. the fluorescence signal was measured at 72\u00b0C during each PCR cycle and at each temperature increment step during the melting analysis. the real time RT-PCR was performed in a Rotor-Gene 3000 machine (Corbett Research, Australia) the amplification temperature profile was 50\u00b0C for 30 min for reverse transcription followed by 95\u00b0C for 5 min and 45 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s, 55\u00b0C for 30 s and 72\u00b0C for 20 s. the fluorescence signal was measured at 55\u00b0C during each PCR cycle and at each temperature increment step during the melting analysis. Viruses Viruses were propagated in either Madin-Darby Canine Kidney Epithelial Cells (MDCK) or primary swine kidney cell cultures. isolation was achieved from routine diagnostic samples, nasal swabs or lung tissue samples. full genome sequencing of all 8 gene segments was performed as previously described by bragstad et al. 2005 [36] 30 known swine pathogens including porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (SIV), porcine respiratory coronavirus, Actinobacillus pleuropneumonia and mycoplasmas were used for the experiment. each group was housed in separate isolation units (biosafety level 3). blood samples obtained on PID 0 and 28 were left on ice to coagulate for 15 minutes and centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C. swabs were placed in 1 ml phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.5) and stored at -80\u00b0C until analysis. sandwich ELISA assay based on anti-human monoclonal antibodies. detection limit was 125 g/ml (porcine SAA equivalents) cross-reactivity of anti human CRP antibody with porcine CRP demonstrated previously. in the HI-test, 25 l PBS was added to each well of a microtitre plate. then 25 l of the antigen (4 HA units) were added to each well. the plate was shaken for 10 sec and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature. RNA was stored at -80\u00b0C until analysis. RNA was extracted from all nasal swabs and lung tissue samples. all positive samples were further tested in a quantitative real time RT-PCR assay. real time RT-PCR was performed in a Rotor-Gene 3000 machine (Corbett Research, Australia) with a total reaction volume of 25 l using the RNA UltrasenseTM One-Step Quantitative RT-PCR System (Invitrogen), 5 l of extracted RNA, 0.4 M of forward primer, 1.0 M of FAM-labelled reverse primer, and 1.0 M of Cy5-labelled probe. a standard curve for the real time RT-PCR assay was obtained using a ten-fold dilution series made from an initial concentration of 107.8 TCID50 per ml of the virus A/swine/Denmark/1993 (H1N1). the efficiency of the PCR was 92% and the range of quantification spanned 6 log10 dilutions from dilution 10-1 to 10-7. study funded by the Danish Agriculture & Food Council, Axelborg."}
