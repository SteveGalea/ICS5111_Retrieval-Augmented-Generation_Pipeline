{"summary": "we have extended the loss assessment to include a valuation of the lives lost as a result of the increases in mortality resulting from influenza-pandemic risk. the inclusion of such a valuation increased the estimated loss attributable to modelled pandemic risk several fold. pandemic severity Excess death attributable to a given influenza pandemic. estimated probabilities that, in any given year, pandemics of varying degrees of severity will occur. expected annual losses Defined in the probabilistic sense as the sum, across severities, of the losses associated with a pandemic. a pandemic of the same severity as the 1918 influenza pandemic might reduce global gross domestic product by about 5%. a severe scenario would lead to income losses of over 12% of gross national income worldwide, including losses of over 50% of lower-income countries. studies have assessed the burden of specific environmental risk factors. the value of a statistical life is sometimes expressed as the value of a standardized mortality unit (SMU), i.e. an increase in the annual risk of death of 1 in 10 000, varies by both the age and income of the individual involved. only one19 of the 10 studies included in a systematic literature review on the costs of influenza,26 took account of the value of mortality risks. value of a statistical life is derived either from questionnaires that canvass how much compensation an individual would demand, to accept a small increase in the probability of their death. a pandemic of the same severity as the 1918 influenza pandemic may reduce global gross domestic product by about 5%. a severe scenario would lead to income losses of over 12% of gross national income worldwide, including losses of over 50% of lower-income countries. the value of mortality risks has been included in estimating costs of vaccine-preventable diseases28 and in evaluating the economic burdens posed by rheumatic heart disease. the value of a statistical life is sometimes expressed as the value of a standardized mortality unit (SMU), i.e. an increase in the annual risk of death of 1 in 10 000, varies by both the age and income of the individual involved. the insurance industry estimates so-called exceedance probability functions. these functions generate estimates of the probability losses from an uncertain event would exceed any specified level. a modelling exercise for the insurance industry concluded that the annual risk of an influenza outbreak on the scale of the 1918 pandemic lies between 0.5% and 1.0%. r(s) is the complementary cumulative of the density for s. we would have expected value of: Expected value of s =0r(s) d(s) d(s) d(s) r(s) = [1 + m(1 \u2013 f)s] \u2013 [1 + 1/(1 \u2013 f)] (2) where f indicates the fatness of the tail, with smaller values implying a fatter tail. a 1918-type pandemic would have killed 21 million to 33 million people in 2015. we defined risk, r(s) in terms of the annual probability of a pandemic having a severity exceeding s SMUs and the return time for s as the expected number of years before a pandemic of at least severity s will occur. for example, if the annual probability of a pandemic of severity at least s is 1%, then its return time will be 100 years. to be conservative, we estimated an expected annual excess mortality rate of 0.93 SMUs. r(s) = [1 + m(1 \u2013 f)s] = [1 + 1/(1 \u2013 f)] (2) where f indicates the fatness of its tail, with smaller values implying a fatter tail. we calibrated this model using historical estimates of the frequency and severity of influenza pandemics. for mortality data relating to the 1918 pandemic, we found two main influenza pandemic scenarios in terms of aggregate mortality: moderate and severe. bolic function in terms of its expectation and the fatness of its tail. r(s) = [1 + m(1 \u2013 f)s] \u2013 [1 + 1/(1 \u2013 f)] (2) where f indicates the fatness of the tail, with smaller values implying a fatter tail. the expected loss combines the risk of a moderate or severe pandemic and the losses from that event. we estimated the expected number of pandemic-related deaths to be about 720 000 per year. most of the expected loss from influenza pandemics results from extreme events. many studies on the potential costs of climate change46 have been hampered by the wide variation in estimates of the so-called social cost of carbon. if this cost is set at about US$ 120 per tonne, the cost of the carbon dioxide emissions in 2013 would have been about 1% of global income. the mortality-associated costs of climate change may be relatively small, but the slowness of climate change should allow for compensatory human adaptation. estimates the losses associated with uncertain and rare events across the full range of potential outcome severities. this could lead to appropriate and beneficial adjustments to each policy-maker\u2019s sense of risk and sense of value and to improved national policies on pandemic preparedness."}
