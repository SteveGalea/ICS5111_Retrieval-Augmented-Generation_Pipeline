{"summary": "diversse genomic- and proteomic databases have been developed to facilitate research using human and rodent models. current porcine gene databases lack the robust annotation to study pig models that are relevant to human studies. a literature-based survey was conducted to identify certain selected genes that have demonstrated function in humans, mice or pigs. electronic supplementary material available to authorized users. additional files Additional file 1: (112.2KB, xlsx) Porcine genes missing in Ensembl build 10.2 of the porcine genome."}
