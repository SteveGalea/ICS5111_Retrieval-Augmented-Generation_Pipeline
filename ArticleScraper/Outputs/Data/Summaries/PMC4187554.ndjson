{"summary": "NGF is the first member of the neurotrophin family discovered by LeviMontalcini. it is involved in the development, growth, and survival of sympathetic nerves. it is involved in the development of several airway diseases, such as asthma. a large body of evidence supports the notion that NGF can alter ion transport in nonpulmonary cells. in PC12 cells, NGF has been demonstrated to increase Na+ current (Pollock et al. 1990), increase Na+/K+pump activity (Boonstra et al. 1983), induce type II/IIA Na+ channel gene expression (D'Arcangelo et al. 1993) NHBE cells were seeded and expanded (20 doublings) in a T75 flask supported by bronchial air\u2013liquid interface (ALI) growth media containing recommended supplements. cells were grown to 80\u201390% confluence. after trypsinization, the cells were transferred to semipermeable rat tail collagen. membrane inserts were fixed in 10% buffered formalin, rinsed in Hank's balanced salt solution (37\u00b0C), dehydrated in graded series of ethanol, cleared in xylene, infiltrated, and embedded in paraffin. membrane inserts were stained apically with a 1% alcian blue solution (3% acetic acid, pH 2.5) for 30 sec. the samples were imaged on a Hitachi 4800 field emission scanning electron microscope (Chiyoda, Tokyo) for TEM, the samples were fixed in Karnovsky's fixative (2.5% gluteraldehyde, 2.5% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 mol/L sodium cacodylic buffer), postfixed in osmium tetroxide, mordanted in 1% tannic acid, and stained en bloc in 0.5% ur agents were due to a change in transcellular as opposed to paracellular ion transport. agents were due to a change in transcellular as opposed to paracellular ion transport. to investigate whether trkA mediates the effects of NGF on ion transport, cells were incubated for 30 min with the nonspecific tyrosine kinase inhibitor, K252a. apical membrane was permeabilized with nystatin (50 mol/L, N6261; SigmaAldrich) responses to ouabain generated in the absence or presence of NGF were compared. results are expressed as a percent change in baseline Isc. cells were washed with PBS (4\u00b0C) and lysed with Pierce RIPA buffer (89901, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) cell lysates were sonicated for two rounds of 10sec pulses, centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min. protein concentrations were determined using a BCA protein assay (23227, Thermo Fisher Scientific) Statistical comparisons between groups containing multiple donors were performed with SAS/STAT software (v9.2) for Windows. results are expressed as a percent of control. cells were allowed to grow for 21 days under ALI culture conditions. growth to confluence was monitored by measuring transepithelial resistance (Rt, EVOM2; World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) cells were used after 21 days of growth. tubulin was detected using immunofluorescence on a microscope equipped with a Pixera Pro 150ES camera. for tubulin immunofluorescence membrane inserts were washed with PBS, fixed with apically applied methanol (4\u00b0C), and stained using a monoclonal antitubulinFITC antibody. epithelial cells were bathed in modified KrebsHenseleit solution. cells were stabilized under opencircuit conditions before applying a 0 mV voltageclamp using an automatic voltage/current amplifier. cells were incubated for 30 min with the nonspecific tyrosine kinase inhibitor, K252a (10 nmol/L, apical, K1639; SigmaAldrich), or DMSO. responses to the ion transport inhibitors were obtained in the absence or presence of NGF. cell lysates were prepared from NHBE cells cultured under ALI culture for 21 days. cells were washed with PBS (4\u00b0C) and lysed with Pierce RIPA buffer (89901, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) Membranes were washed three times with TBST20 (28360, Thermo Fisher Scientific), incubated with the secondary antibody, IRDye 680LT (92668021, LiCor), and then developed and analyzed on an Odyssey infrared imaging system. results are expressed as a percent of control. NHBE cells grew into a welldifferentiated airway epithelium resembling that of in situ tissue. production of mucus was confirmed using alcian blue staining. TEM imaging revealed presence of a 9 + 2 doublet in cilia. after 21 days of ALI culture, cells placed into a Ussing chamber displayed a Vt value of 7.1 3.4 mV. Basal Isc was 5.9 1.0 A/cm2 (average of 4 donors) preliminary NGF concentration\u2013response curves were generated to investigate whether NGF could elicit bioelectrical responses in airway epithelial cells. amiloride reduced the Isc by 4.6%, but in the presence of NGF, amiloride reduced the Isc by 41.6 3.0%. NGF had no effect on the response to the Cl channel inhibitor, NPPB or the Na+/K+ATPase inhibitor, ouabain. responses to amiloride were generated after 30min incubation with 1 ng/mL NGF. cells were incubated for 30 min with the nonspecific tyrosine kinase inhibitor K252a (10 nmol/L; apical) or DMSO as the vehicle control. cells were either incubated apically with the nonspecific tyrosine kinase inhibitor, K252a, or DMSO for 30 min prior to generating responses to (A) NGF, (B) amiloride, (C) NPPB, and (D) ouabain in the absence or presence of NGF. trkA receptor, when activated by NGF, can activate several intracellular signaling cascades. cells were either incubated apically and basolaterally with the specific Erk 1/2 inhibitor, PD98059, or DMSO for 30 min prior to generating responses to (A) NGF, (B) amiloride, (C) NPPB, and (D) ouabain in the absence or presence of NGF. NGF does not affect Na+/K+ATPase activity. in the presence of nystatin, apically applied NGF had no effect on Isc. there was no significant difference in the responses to ouabain between the vehicle control and NGFtreated groups. this results suggest that the NGFinduced Erk 1/2 activation is a localized signaling event. NGF did not reduce the amiloridesensitive Na+ transport in cells incubated for either 24 or 48 h. responses to known ion transport inhibitors were generated after incubating cells 24 h (A\u2013C) and 48 h (D\u2013F) with 1 ng/mL NGF. epithelial proteases or NGF were internalized into the cells with the trkA receptor. reductions in NGF concentration were observed in inserts lacking cells. apical NGF mediates ENaC phosphorylation through a trkAErk 1/2 signaling pathway. the increases in Erk 1/2 activity and ENaC phosphorylation were blocked by K252a and PD98059 (30 mol/L, apical and basolateral; Fig. 11C) ng/mL, 5 min, resulted in a twofold increase in ENaC phosphorylation. blots incubated with NGF for 5 min showed a threefold increase in phosphorylatedENaC (76 kDa) cells were stripped and probed for ENaC (75 kDa) and Actin (42 kDa) differentiation of NHBE cells was confirmed through several imaging techniques. these structures were confirmed to be cilia through the use of (D) transmission electron microscopy, which revealed the presence of a 9 + 2 doublet of microtubules, and (E) immunofluorescence for tubulin. after 21 days of ALI culture, cells placed into a Ussing chamber displayed a Vt value of 7.1 3.4 mV. on transport inhibitors were added apically or basolaterally as appropriate. in the absence of NGF, amiloride (3.5 105 mol/L, apical) caused a 55.3 4.6% reduction in Isc. in the presence of NGF, amiloride reduced the Isc by 41.6 3.0%. responses to (A) amiloride, (B) NPPB, and (C) ouabain were calculated as a percent change from baseline (4 donors). NGF significantly reduced the amiloride response (P = 0.0127). K252a attenuated the NGFinduced reduction in Na+ transport. there were no significant changes in the responses to NPPB or ouabain. trkA receptor mediates bioelectric responses to NGF. cells were either incubated apically and basolaterally with the specific Erk 1/2 inhibitor, PD98059, or DMSO 60 min prior to generating responses to ion transport inhibitors in the absence or presence of NGF. PD98059 significantly reduced the response to NGF, and also attenuated the NGFinduced reduction in amiloridesensitive Na+ transport. errero et al. 2001) and activity (Lei et al. 2008) in alveolar epithelial cells. it is possible that NGF could affect Na+/K+ATPase activity in addition to Na+ transport. cells incubated for 24 h or 48 h with apically applied NGF (1 ng/mL) or MKHS were placed into the ussing system to measure responses to amiloride. the reduction in Na+ transport is a transient, nongenomic cellular response to NGF. there were no detectable levels of endogenous NGF in any transwell inserts with or without cells incubated with MKHS. however, after 5min incubation on inserts which contained cells, the NGF concentration was reduced by 93%. epidermal growth factor (EGF) also activates an Erk 1/2mediated pathway. this activation was inhibited by K252a and PD98059. apical NGF (1 ng/mL, 5 min) resulted in twofold Erk 1/2 activation and threefold increase in ENaC phosphorylation. mediated activation of Erk 1/2 resulted in ENaC phosphorylation. blots for Erk 1/2 (42 and 44 kDa), phosphorylated Erk 1/2 (PErk; 44 and 45 kDa), phosphorylated ENaC (76 kDa) and the loading control, actin (47 kDa). NGF acting through a trkAErk1/2 mediated signaling pathway leads to ENaC phosphorylation. results suggest that NGF reduces Na+ transport in airway epithelial cells. the regulation of ENaC can be controlled through a variety of factors. trkA occurs within 1 min, with maximum trkA activation occurring after a 5min incubation with NGF. phosphorylation of Thr613 and Thr623 on ENaC results in much higher binding affinity between the WW domain on the E3 ubiquitinprotein ligase Nedd4. amiloride was blunted and was no longer significant. the fact that there was a trend toward an effect on responses to amiloride could suggest that NGF had initiated a longer term, \u201chit and run\u201d effect during the first 5 min of incubation with NGF."}
