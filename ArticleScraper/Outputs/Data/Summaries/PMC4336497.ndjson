{"summary": "mRNA and protein levels of IFITM1, PLSCR1, STAT1, STAT2, and IRF-7 in AI-resistant breast cancer cells and AI-resistant tumors. suppression of IFITM1 significantly enhanced estradiol-induced cell death in AI-resistant MCF-7:5C cells. suppression of IFN dramatically reduced IFITM1, PLSCR1, p-STAT1 and p-STAT2 expression in the resistant cells. results demonstrate that constitutive overexpression of ISGs enhances the progression of AI-resistant breast cancer."}
