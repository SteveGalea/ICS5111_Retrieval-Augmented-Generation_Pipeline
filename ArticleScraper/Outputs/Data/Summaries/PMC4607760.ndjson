{"summary": "mice were anesthetized with an i.p. injection of 150 L of a mixture of ketamine and xylazine. clinical severity was assessed by blinded investigators using a previously described four-point scoring scale. single cells were resuspended in modified Eagle\u2019s medium:F12 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen), insulin-transferrin-selenium-X (Invitrogen), penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen), 40 ng/mL T3 (T67407; Sigma, St. Louis, MO), and 20 ng/mL human recombinant epidermal Western Blot Analysis NPCs were plated on Matrigel-coated 6-well plates. they were treated with either 100 nmol/L FTY720 phosphate or vehicle for 5 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, and 4 hours. the cells were then lysed using radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer. mouse Olig 2 (1:200; Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany), mouse\u2013anti-mouse Map2 (1:750; Sigma), Alexa-594 anti-rabbit (1:500; Invitrogen), and anti-mouse (1:1000; Invitrogen) were used as secondary antibodies. the percentage of immunopositive cells for each stain was determined by dividing the total number of immunopositive cells by the total number of DAPI-positive cells. spinal cords were isolated at defined time points and fixed overnight with 4% paraformaldehyde at 4\u00b0C. individual spinal cords were divided into sections, and twelve coronal sections (1 mm thick) were cryoprotected in 20% sucrose and embedded in OCT. images at 1200 magnification were analyzed for g-ratio using ImageJ software. a minimum of 150 axons were analyzed per mouse. g-ratio was calculated by dividing the axon diameter by the total fiber diameter. rat\u2013anti-mouse CD4-allophycocyanin (1:50; Biolegend, San Diego, CA), rat\u2013anti-mouse CD8-allophycocyanin (1:50; Biolegend, San Diego, CA), rat\u2013anti-mouse CD8-allophycocyanin (1:50; Biolegend, San Diego, CA), rat\u2013anti-mouse CD8-allophycocyanin (1:50; Biolegen ethyl]-1,3-propanediol, hydrochloride, and FTY720P were purchased from Cayman Chemical Co (Ann Arbor, MI) the vehicle was administered by daily i.p. injections of 100 L. experiments for all animal studies were reviewed and approved by the University of Utah. a reverse transcription kit was synthesized with a reverse transcription kit superscript VILO (invitrogen) the primers were used to identify S1P1-S1P5 mRNA expression. the primers were purchased from Invitrogen. se (1:2000; Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA) and phosphorylated p44/42 MAP kinase (1:15,000; Cell Signaling) were detected by Western blot analysis using horseradish peroxidase\u2013conjugated secondary antibodies (1:25,000; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory, West Grove, PA) mice were anesthetized with an i.p. injection of 150 L of a mixture of ketamine (Western Medical Supply, Arcadia, CA) and xylazine (Phoenix Pharmaceutical, Saint Joseph, MO) mice also received daily i.p. injections of 3 mg/kg FTY720 starting at day 13 p.i. and a control group received vehicle starting at day 13 p.i. demyelinated white matter scored as a percentage of total demyelination along the entire length of the spinal cord. total numbers of GFP-positive cells were determined in each of the twelve spinal cord sections surrounding the transplant site by counting GFP-positive cells colocalized with DAPI-positive nuclei. fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; 1:1000; Invitrogen), and rabbit\u2013anti-mouse Ki-67 (1:300; Abcam, Cambridge, MA) sections were then washed in PBS and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with Alexa fluorescent-conjugated secondary antibodies (goat\u2013anti-rabbit Alexa 594 or goat\u2013anti-mouse Alexa 594; 1:1000 in PBS; Invitrogen) previous studies have demonstrated that FTY720 preferentially binds S1P1, S1P3, S1P4 and S1P5 receptors, including lower affinity for S1P4. we tested whether mouse NPCs expressed S1P receptors and if FTY720 treatment affected defined responses. Western blot analysis of cultured NPCs treated with either vehicle or 100 nmol/L phosphorylated active form of FTY720 (FTY720P) reveals increased phosphorylation over time. astrocytes and neurons are also present. n = 3 independent experiments (D) showed similar frequencies of GFAP-positive cells. FTY720 treatment Enhances migration of engrafted GFP-NPCs. FTY720 treatment enhances migration of engrafted green fluorescent protein (GFP)\u2013neural progenitor cells (NPCs) mice were treated with FTY720 (3 mg/kg daily via i.p. injection) or vehicle control beginning at day 13 postinfection (p.i.) cultured NPCs were treated with increasing concentrations of FTY720P (10 nmol/L, 100 nmol/L, and 1 mol/L) migration in response to 200 ng/mL recombinant mouse CXCL12 resulted in a dose-dependent migration response. FTY720 treatment does not affect surface expression of CXCR4 by neural progenitor cells (NPCs) the severity of spinal cord demyelination was similar in transplanted mice treated with FTY720 when compared with control animals. the severity of demyelination was similar in transplanted mice treated with FTY720 when compared with control animals. n = 3 independent experiments (C); n = 3 independent experiments (C). FP-NPCs and treated with FTY720 or vehicle were analyzed. mice were infected with 150 plaque-forming units of JHMV and 3 mg/kg FTY720 or control vehicle treatment initiated at day 13 postinfection (p.i.) and transplanted with green fluorescent protein (GFP)\u2013neural progenitor cells. n = 2 independent experiments with n = 4 or more mice per experimental group (B); n = 2 independent experiments with n = 5 or more mice per experimental group (D) scale bar = 50 m (A) Figure 6. FTY720 treatment does not promote remyelination. TY720 treatment does not enhance remyelination in JHMV-infected mice. treatment with FTY720 does not affect neuroinflammation in JHMV-infected mice. there is no difference in frequencies of CD4+ (A) or CD8+ (B) T cells and virus-specific CD4+ (A) or CD8+ (B) T cells in mice treated with either vehicle control or FTY720. FTY720 does not reduce overall frequencies of infiltrating CD4+ (C) or CD8+ (D) T cells compared with vehicle-treated control mice. FTY720 induces lymphopenia and down-regulates sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1) on T cells. n = 2 or more experiments with a minimum n = 4 per group (A\u2013D) neurospheres were isolated from the subventricular zone of eGFP-S1P1 knock-in mice. immunofluorescence confirmed that NPCs express S1P1 as evidenced by GFP expression. previous studies have demonstrated that FTY720 treatment activates several intracellular signaling cascades. exposure of cultured NPCs to 100 nmol/L FTY720P did not influence differentiation because we detected similar frequencies of oligodendroglia (Olig2 positive), astrocytes (GFAP) and neurons (Map2) compared with vehicle-control\u2013treated cultures. FTY720 does not affect neural progenitor cell differentiation. JHMV and GFP-expressing NPCs (GFP-NPCs) were transplanted into the spinal cord at day 14 p.i.,8,11,37,39 and FTY720 treatment (3 mg/kg daily, via i.p. injection) was initiated at day 13 p.i. transplanted GFP-NPCs migrate both rostral and caudal from the implantation site in both control and FTY720-treated mice. images represent spinal cord sections rostral (1 to 4) and caudal (5 to 8) from the transplantation site. migration in response to 200 ng/mL recombinant mouse CXCL12 resulted in a dose-dependent migration response. Flow analysis revealed that FTY720 treatment did not affect surface expression of CXCR4 at any concentration tested. therefore, administration of FTY720 enhances migration of NPCs potentially by enhancing CXCR4 function. the severity of spinal cord demyelination was similar in transplanted mice treated with FTY720 compared with control animals. the severity of demyelination was similar in transplanted mice treated with FTY720 when compared with control animals. luxol fast blue\u2013stained spinal cord sections from NPC-transplanted mice treated with either FTY720 or control vehicle at day 14 p.i. and treated with either FTY720 or control at day 13 p.i. f: Calculation of g-ratio, as a measurement of axonal remyelination, shows no significant differences between experimental mice. we first determined whether FTY720 treatment alone increased remyelination in JHMV-infected mice. mice were infected intracranially with JHMV, and mice received daily i.p. injections of FTY720 beginning at day 13 p.i. Flow analysis of T-cell infiltration into the spinal cords of infected mice isolated at day 28 p.i. indicated no differences in CD4+ or CD8+ T cells within the spinal cords of mice treated with either FTY720 or vehicle alone. n = 4 mice or more per group (A\u2013D) transplantation of GFP-NPCs into JHMV-infected mice did not affect infiltration of total CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. administration of FTY720 to infected mice transplanted with GFP-NPCs did not prevent total T-cell or virus-specific T-cell entry into the CNS. FTY720 significantly diminishes the frequency of CD4+ (A) and CD8+ (C) T cells and S1P1 expression measured by GFP expression on CD4+ (B) and CD8+ (D) T cells. chronic FTY720 degrades and down modulates the receptor in the CNS. we investigated the effects of treatment in conjunction with NPC therapy in a viral model of MS. receptors involved in elevated CXCR4 function will be critical to better understand molecular mechanisms governing how receptor agonists/antagonists influence NPC migration mediated by CXCR4. our findings also indicated increased numbers of GFP-NPCs within demyelinated white matter tracts of GFP-NPCs in JHMV-infected mice treated with FTY720 when compared with transplanted mice treated with vehicle control. surviving mice have reduced viral titers below the level of detection. treatment with FTY720 would have limited-to-no effect on disease progression. T cells do not rely on S1P signaling for T-cell migration to the CNS. this is similar to previous studies that determined that FTY720 does not induce remyelination in either the cuprizone or lysophosphatidyl choline models of demyelination. this is similar to previous studies that determined that FTY720 did not induce remyelination in either the organotypic cerebral slices where demyelination was induced by lysolecithin. lination."}
