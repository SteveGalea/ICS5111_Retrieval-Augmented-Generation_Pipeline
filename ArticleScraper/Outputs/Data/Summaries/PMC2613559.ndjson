{"summary": "Vaccinia virus (VV) provided excellent prophylactic immunity to variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox, and led to the eradication of this fatal disease in the world [1]\u2013[3]. in recent years, VV has also been successfully used as a live vaccine vector for the prevention or eradication of other infectious diseases [4], [5]. studies have been carried out to investigate whether different vaccinia-based vaccine vectors would offer any advantages especially for inducing protective immune responses [31]\u2013[33]. this is a critical issue because different VV vectors may harbor distinct profiles in terms of immune modulation and host virulence. a recent study suggested that the intranasal delivery of a VTT-based vaccine induced strong HIV-specific immune responses. the safety profile of this particular vaccine for mucosal use was not mentioned in the publication. however, we demonstrated that the unmodified VTT retains its virulence and pathogencity in animal studies especially after intranasal administration. pZCxz contains two promoters namely pSYN and pH 5, which are both vaccinia virus-specific early/later promoters. pZCxz was constructed using a homologous recombination method in vero cells. the virus was purified through consecutive plaque selection using GFP as a surrogate marker. the comparable level of S-glycoprotein expression was detected in CEF cells infected with 1106 PFU of either MVTT-S (lane 2) or MVA-S (lane 3) using the Western blot assay. immunohistochemistry assay was developed for the detection of SARS-CoV S glycoprotein expressed on cell surface. cinia virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1. cells were lysed on ice for 30 minutes in 100 L of lysis buffer. blots were blocked in 5% milk and 0.5% BSA in PBS. two groups of six-week old mice were inoculated with 105 and 106 PFU of MVTT-S. each group had six mice. the viral virulence was determined by the daily measurement of animal body weight change for a period of 31 days. groups of six-week-old BALB/c mice were immunized by the s.c. injection of 106 PFU VTT at day 1. these mice were kept for six months and then inoculated with 106 PFU MVTT-S or MVA-S twice at one month interval via i.m.; s.c.; i.n.; i.o. routes. sera were collected two weeks after each inoculation for analysis. vaccinia neutralization was based on a previous publication using the fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. a modified dual-promoter insertion vector was constructed to target the genomic region of VTT. pZCxz contains two promoters namely pSYN and pH 5, which are both vaccinia virus-specific early/later promoters. the restriction enzymes Bam HI and Xho I were used for constructing MVTT-S. the insertion region corresponds to the Del III region of MVA. no S-glycoprotein expression was detected on vero cells infected with MVTT-S. in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) cells were washed and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature. blots were blocked in 5% milk and 0.5% BSA in PBS. two groups of six-week old mice were inoculated with 105 and 106 PFU of MVTT-S via the i.n. route. each group was inoculated with one of 104, 105 and 106 PFU of either viruses, or a saline control. groups of 3 BALB/c mice (6-week-old) were immunized with 105 PFU of each virus at weeks 0 and 3 via i.m., i.n., i.o., i.r. routes. the vaccinated mice were sacrificed two weeks after the second injection and their blood samples were used for analysis. the pseudotype virus was generated by co-transfecting 293T cells with two plasmids pcDNA-Sopt9 and pNL4-3Luc+EnvVpr carrying the optimized S gene and a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 backbone. the mixture was combined with 16 ng polybrene (in 40 l medium) and added to HEK293T-ACE2 cells (10,000 cells per well in 100 l) MVTT genome in a location which corresponds to the Del III region of MVA-S. the shuttle vector contains dual promoters which allow simultaneous expression of two target genes. both genes were included within the same insertion frame, the GFP served as a surrogate marker for the selection of recombinant VTT carrying the S gene. d BALB/c mouse was chosen for the assessment of MVTT-S virulence. none of the mice died during the experiment period. MVTT-S likely retains an attenuated phenotype. two independent immunization experiments were conducted with similar results. MVTT-S induced at least over 100-fold higher Nab response than MVTT-S via i.n. inoculation. seven groups of three BALB/c mice (6-week-old) were immunized via i.n., i.o., i.m., i.r., i.d., i.p., s.c. routes using an identical sub-optimal dose (105 PFU), respectively. all of the animals were immunized twice at a three-week interval. groups of 3 mice were inoculated with 105 PFU MVTT-S or MVA-S (B) twice at a three-week interval via seven different routes. the sera were collected two weeks after the last injection and subjected to the neutralization assay. no neutralizing antibody response was detected among mice previously exposed to wild-type VTT. 2106 PFU is the highest dose possible for mucosal vaccination based on the concentration of our viral stocks. mucosal vaccination overcomes the pre-existing immune response induced by the s.c. exposure to wild-type VTT due to the suppression of MVTT-S in the previous experiment. six experimental groups of four mice were pre-inoculated with 106 PFU VTT via the s.c. route. three groups of mice received placebo. experimental groups of 4 mice were inoculated with 106 PFU VTT via the s.c. route. they were given one (Vac1) or two (Vac2) injections of 2106 PFU MVTT-S or MVA-S twice at one month interval via heterologous routes. higher levels of anti-VTT Nabs were induced via i.n. (11384) and i.o. (1675) than via s.c. (168) inoculations just before the administration of MVA-S and MVTT-S. this finding suggests that these higher levels of anti-VTT Nabs probably affect the effectiveness of the subsequent MVA-S and MVTT-S vaccination. IC50 stands for the antibody titer when 50% of virus was neutralized. a modified shuttle vector was constructed to target the S gene into the MVTT genome in a location which corresponds to the Del III region of MVA-S. rabbit antibody bound to the N-terminal 400 amino acids of the protein appeared at the position above 170 kDa. MVTT-S was passaged on vero cells nine times. by evaluating 50 foci after the 9th passage, 100% expressed both S glycoprotein and vaccinia proteins. this indicates that MVTT-S is likely genetically stable. the body weight of animals was measured overtime post inoculation. the arrow indicates the time of each viral inoculation. a pseudotype-based neutralization assay was established to characterize the immune sera generated in mice. group of 3 mice were injected with MVTT-S twice at a dose of 104 (square), 105 (cycle), 106 (triangle) PFU at a three-week interval. a pseudotype-based neutralization assay was performed to determine the level of Nab response. the Y axis stands for the percentage of inhibition whereas the X axis represents the serum dilution factor. i.n. or i.o. immunization only induced antibodies capable of neutralizing about 25\u201330% of virus at 110 dilution. MVTT-S induced much higher levels of SARS-CoV-specific Nabs in mice that were immunized with MVTT-S via the i.n. or i.o. routes of inoculations. pre-mucosal exposure to wild-type VTT prevents the subsequent Nab response using the same route of vaccination. four groups of four mice were inoculated with 106 PFU VTT via i.n. and i.o. routes. another four groups received placebo. groups of 4 mice were inoculated with 106 PFU VTT via i.n. or i.o. route. subsequently (six months later) injected with 2106 PFU MVTT-S or MVA-S. no anti-S Nab responses were detected in these animals. the s.c. pre-exposure to VTT had much less interference on the immunogenicity of MVTT-S when delivered using a heterologous route. i.o. and i.n. were still able to induce higher levels (20-to-50-fold) of anti-S Nab response when compared with the i.m. immunization. anti-VTT Nabs were induced via i.n. (11384) and i.o. (1675) than via s.c. (168) inoculations just before the administration of MVA-S and MVTT-S. similar findings were obtained with i.o. or i.n. MVTT-S. i.n. and i.o. inoculations of MVTT-S were able to induce anti-S Nab responses. the second immunization also significantly boosted anti-S Nab responses against MVTT-S via i.m. or MVA-S via i.n. inoculations. we found that MVA-S induced 2-3-fold higher levels of Nab response than MVTT-S in mice via the i.m. route of inoculation using sub-optimal doses. this finding suggests that the replicating MVTT-S does not seem to offer much advantage when delivered intramuscularly, a systemic way of vaccination. strains with MVA for inducing Nab responses are 10-fold higher than those induced via the i.m. route. MVTT-S may target the mucosa-associated antigen presenting cells more efficiently. vTT-S may contain mucosa-specific immune regulatory proteins. ucosal exposure to wild-type VTT had a profound effect in preventing the subsequent Nab response using the same route of vaccination by MVTT-S. if the pre-exposure was through the s.c. route, mucosal vaccination via either i.n. or i.o. inoculation was able to overcome the pre-existing immune response to the vector. if the pre-exposure was through the s.c. route, mu anti-VTT response probably played a critical role in eliminating the subsequent inoculation of MVTT-S through the autologous route or in preventing viral dissemination. on the other hand, the data highlight the importance of the proper selection of vaccination routes for VTT- or MVTT-based vaccine vectors. vector for the development of future mucosal vaccines."}
