{"summary": "recent studies have demonstrated that CTCL cells overexpress the CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4). a xenograft model of CTCL was established and a recombinant adeno-associated viral serotype 8 vector expressing a humanized single-chain variable fragment (scFvFc or \u201cminibody\u201d) of anti-CCR4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) h1567 was evaluated for curative treatment. cutaneous T cell lymphomas (CTCLs) are a clinically heterogeneous group of lymphoproliferative malignancies characterized by the clonal accumulation of mature and skin-homing memory T cells. mycosis fungoides (MF) accounts for 50%\u201360% of CTCL cases. primary cutaneous CD30+ lymphoproliferative disorders, more specifically primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (PC-ALCL), accounts for expression of CCR4 is limited amongst non-malignant cells. it is absent on nave T cells, and present on fewer than half of all memory T cells. targeted therapy against CCR4 may be attractive treatment option for malignancies. the humanized anti-CCR4 mAb gene was packaged into an AAV vector. intravenous delivery of this h1567 minibody-encoding AAV vector allowed for rapid and accurate assessment of its therapeutic potential. mAb 1567 can serve as an effective antibody-directed therapy for immunodepleting malignant CTCL cells. nude mice received a single injection of two different concentrations of AAV8-h1567 via intravenous tail vein injection. serum levels rose for the first 2\u20133 weeks, reaching levels of circa 65 and 96 ug/ml for the low (0.81011 vg/mouse) and high (2.01011 vg/mouse) vector doses. serum levels were measured over time by human IgG ELISA. western blotting analysis of monomer and dimer forms of the 11A and h1567 minibodies using an anti-human IgG1-Fc antibody. binding specificity of the control 11A minibody was shown using cCR4-positive cell lines, Mac-1 and 293T-CCR4. 11A and h1567 minibodies recovered from in vitro and in vivo sources showed bands at the expected size for scFvFc, circa 60 kD. analysis under non-reducing conditions showed dimer formation (mol wt circa 120 kD), thereby confirming that the minibodies were divalent in vitro and in vivo. the ease of recovery of the AAV8-derived minibodies from serum using affinity purification on protein A. groups of 4 mice were given a single intravenous injection of AAV8-h1567 or control AAV8-11A vector on day 7. a single injection of AAV8-h1567 resulted in significantly reduced tumor growth compared with mice treated with AAV8-11A or untreated mice. immunostaining shows tumor-infiltrating neutrophils (brown stain) in tumor from the SCID-BEIGE mice 21 days after administration of AAV8-h1567 encoding anti-CCR4 minibody. no staining was seen in the tumor from the SCID-BEIGE mice. immunoostaining of tumors sections with neutrophil-specific Ly-6G mAb confirmed infiltration of neutrophils into tumors treated with AAV8-h1567. in vitro ADCC assay was carried out using purified SCID-BEIGE mouse neutrophils and h1567 minibody. therapeutic CTCL model was further extended to evaluate role of human effector cells in tumor cell killing using bioluminescence imaging (BLI) of luciferase expressing CCR4+ Mac-1 cells. ten SCID-BEIGE mice that were grafted with 1106 CCR4+ Mac-1 cells and developed equivalent sized tumors as detected on day 7 by BLI. PBMC-mediated antitumor activity of the h1567 minibody in a xenograft mouse model. growth in tumor volume was quantified by caliper measurements. tumor progression was significantly inhibited in the AAV8-h1567-treated group compared with the AAV8-11A control group. CD56 immunostaining shows highly positive CD56 tumor-infiltrating human NK cells (brown stain) in tumor from the SCID/BEIGE mice treated with AAV8-h1567. negative CD56 staining was seen in the tumor treated with control vector AAV8-11A plus hPBMCs (lower panel) NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity was observed in a dose-dependent manner. minibody concentrations from 0.0001 to 0.1 ug/ml were tested at an E:T ratio of 21. the average and error bars (mean + SD) shown are representative of three independent experiments. high (2.01011 vg/mouse) vector doses leveled off at near peak levels. 21011 vg per mouse gave higher serum levels of h1567. this vector concentration was used in the subsequent in vivo studies. minibody proteins recovered from in vitro culture and serum following in vivo transduction are shown. the specific binding of h1567 scFv-Fc in serum was shown using CCR4-positive cell lines, Mac-1 and 293T-CCR4 by flow cytometry. an equivalent concentration of the control 11A minibody did not show any binding. scFvFc minibodies showed dimer formation (mol wt circa 120 kD) in vitro and in vivo. ease of recovery of the AAV8-derived minibodies from serum using affinity purification on protein A, their reactivity on Western blot with the anti-human Fc antibody and their stable dimer formation. a single injection of AAV8-h1567 resulted in significantly reduced tumor growth compared with mice treated with AAV8-11A or untreated mice. mice significantly outlived (P0.005) mice treated with AAV8-11A or untreated mice. in vitro ADCC activity was assessed using purified SCID-BEIGE neutrophils as effector cells and CCR4+ Mac-1 cells as target cells. Neutrophil-mediated lysis of target cells was induced at an E:T ratio of 801. in vitro ADCC assay was carried out using purified mouse neutrophils. h1567 minibody was not able to induce neutrophil-mediated cytotoxicity. these in vitro results correlate with the observed anti-tumor activity in vivo. human PBMCs (hPBMCs) were given by intraperitoneal injection 7 days after AAV vector administration. treatment with AAV8-h1567 and hPBMCs resulted in substantial tumor growth inhibition compared to hPBMC treated mice. quantitative monitoring of tumor growth by in vivo BLI correlated with visible tumor growth. mice were given a single intravenous injection of AAV vectors 11 days after inoculation of the tumor cells. a single injection of PBMC was followed by a single injection of PBMC on day 18. tumor growth was monitored in vivo by optical imaging and quantified weekly by bioluminescent imaging. control 11A minibody showed only very low levels of killing. in vitro and in vivo data strongly support that h1567 mediated killing occurs, at least in part, through FcRIIIA engagement and activation of immune cell effector functions. h1567 minibody-treated and 11A control minibody-treated group. all data is shown as the mean SD. mAb h1567 may be clinically active against CTCL. scFvFc minibodies have been shown to be functionally comparable with full-length IgG. they comprise a single polypeptide chain that does not require balanced heavy and light antibody chain heterocomplex associations. functional integrity of the h1567 minibody was also shown by its potent in vivo anti-tumor and in vitro killing activities. the therapeutic effect of the h1567 was monitored using tumor size measurements and BLI analysis. in comparison with the measurement of tumor volume, BLI analysis enabled earlier tumor detection and revealed extensive cell death in response to h1567 treatment. PET imaging indicated invasive tumor cell infiltration into surrounding tissues which was not seen in the h1567 treated mice. mAb to CD4 (GenMab) has been designated an orphan drug for the treatment of MF by the FDA. a subset of malignant T cells in some CTCL have been shown to act as CCR4+ Tregs to suppress anti-tumor responses and may fuel disease progression. humanized anti-CCR4 mAb has shown promising results in CTCL animal studies [42] and in clinical trials for refractory adult T-cell leukemia (ATLL) and peripheral T cell lymphoma (PLCL) the results of the present study have validated the utility of an AAV8-based therapeutic minibody gene transfer platform for the rapid experimental evaluation of mAbs.
