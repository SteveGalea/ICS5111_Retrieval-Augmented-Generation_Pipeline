{"summary": "research was conducted in lowland amazonian forest south of Iquitos. rainfall is substantial (2,800 mm/year), with a modest dry season (185 mm/month) from June to October and a wet season (292 mm/month) the influx of pioneer species into abandoned chacra during the subsequent 5 to 10 years results in early successional forest that locally is called purma. chacra and purma typically have clearly defined boundaries and almost always occur adjacent to bosque (Supplementary Data SD1A) each plot was 250 m 250 m (Supplementary Data SD2) and was sampled for two three-night sessions. a different block was selected randomly for sampling each month. the order of sampling remained the same during the dry season. we characterized species as dominant, common, or rare based on relative abundances. a dominant species was one whose relative abundance was greater than that of all other species. a dominant species was one whose relative abundance was greater than that of all other species. plot-level descriptions represent characterizations at the -scale and treatment categories represent characterizations at the -scale. a species that was only captured in chacra or purma was rare in bosque. a posteriori tests were performed only when GLMMs were significant. each metric, except for total abundance, was expressed as its numbers equivalent to estimate \u201ctrue\u201d biodiversity. this transformation scales dominance so that larger magnitudes of the metric represent lower dominance but higher biodiversity. effects of habitat and season on guild composition (i.e., SAD) and structure (i.e., RAD) were evaluated with separate chi-square randomization tests. results are not sensitive to small expected values, and it is not necessary to specify degrees of freedom. Iquitos is in the Inambari area of endemism, which is a conservation priority because it harbors many restricted-range and endemic species. deforestation in the Iquitos region was generally associated with small-scale slash-and-burn subsistence agricultural practices. five replicate blocks were located along the Iquitos\u2013Nauta Highway. each block contained three plots: one in closed-canopy forest (i.e., bosque), one in agriculture (i.e., chacra), and one in secondary forest (i.e., purma). each plot was 250 m 250 m (Supplementary Data SD2) and was sampled for two three-night sessions. up to 20 individuals of each species at each plot in each season were sacrificed and prepared as standard museum specimens. each individual was marked by fur trimming to prevent it from being counted more than once in estimates of abundance during a particular season. research involving live animals followed the guidelines for the capture, handling, and care of mammals. we classified bats into broad foraging guilds (i.e., aerial insectivores, frugivores, gleaning animalivores, high-flying insectivores, nectarivores, sanguinivores) based on published recommendations. a dominant species was one whose relative abundance was 1/S. species richness (i.e., cumulative number of species), Shannon diversity, Camargo evenness, Berger\u2013Parker dominance, local rarity, and total abundance (i.e., cumulative number of individuals regardless of species) each metric, except for total abundance, was expressed as its numbers equivalent to estimate \u201ctrue\u201d biodiversity (Jost 2006). block was modeled as a random factor to account for natural spatial variation associated with the distribution of sites through space. the inclusion of block as a random factor removes spatial variation associated with the distribution of sites through space, effectively accounting for any form of spatial autocorrelation prior to evaluation of effects of habitat and season on bat biodiversity. research was conducted in lowland amazonian forest south of Iquitos (3.74\u00b0S, 73.24\u00b0W) in northeastern Peru. rainfall is substantial (2,800 mm/year), with a modest dry season (185 mm/month) from June to October and a wet season (292 mm/month) new chacras are typically created next to recently abandoned land that will grow into purma. new chacras are typically created next to recently abandoned land that will grow into purma. chacra and purma typically have clearly defined boundaries. each plot was 250 m 250 m (Supplementary Data SD2) and was sampled for two three-night sessions. a different block was selected randomly for sampling each month. the order of sampling remained the same during the dry season. land amazonia except for recognizing Carollia benkeithi as distinct from Car. Castanea, Platyrrhinus incarum as distinct from P. helleri (Velazco et al. 2010), Gardnernycteris as a distinct genus from Mimon (Hurtado and Pacheco 2014), and Micronycterinae, Glyphonycterinae, and Rhinophyllinae plot-level descriptions represent characterizations at the -scale and descriptions at the level of treatment combinations represent characterizations at the -scale. for each guild, we used a generalized linear mixed-effects model (GLMM\u2014Venables and Ripley 2002) to quantify effects of habitat type (bosque versus chacra versus purma), season (wet versus dry), and their interaction on each of seven metrics of biodiversity. each metric, except for total abundance, was expressed as its numbers equivalent to estimate \u201ctrue\u201d biodiversity. a posteriori tests were conducted using the R programming environment (R Core Team 2015) and the MASS (Venables and Ripley 2002), nlme (Pinheiro and Bates 2000), or multicomp (Hothorn et al. 2008) libraries. composition and RADs to represent the structure of taxonomic biodiversity. effects of habitat and season on guild composition and structure were evaluated with separate chi-square randomization tests in Ecosim version 7. results are not sensitive to small expected values, and it is not necessary to specify degrees of freedom.

this was driven primarily by increases in the abundances of frugivorous and nectarivorous bats. zoonoses have been recorded from Car. perspicillata in the Neotropics. habitat conversion in the united states has increased risk of Lyme disease for humans due to increased abundances of its most competent reservoir. this increase in proximity of bats and humans has led to outbreaks of Nipah virus, which is transmitted by the bats, in those rural human populations. gleaning animalivores did not differ between bosque and chacra during either season. mean abundance in chacra was lower during the wet season and higher during the dry season compared to contemporaneous mean abundances in bosque. the primary response by frugivores to chacra was for dominance to be higher. purma harbored only a modest subset of the species from bosque during each season (four of nine in the dry season; seven of 11 in the wet season) differences in RADs between purma and purma depended on season (i.e., no difference in wet season, significant difference in dry season), and were strongly related to variation in abundance of the most dominant species. differences between purma and bosque were much greater in the dry season (E = 4.8, H\u2032 = 4.5, D = 3.8) than in the wet season (E = 0.4, H\u2032 = 0.7, D = 0.4) secondary forest patches (purma) may not negatively affect species richness for frugivores or gleaning animalivores at larger spatial scales. the extent to which this is true would likely diminish as total area of closed-canopy forest decreases. the extent to which abandonment of agricultural plots and secondary succession are reduced and impaired, respectively, and the intensity of and total area devoted to agriculture increases. abundance and diversity of hosts that serve as reservoirs or vectors of disease can influence human exposure to zoonotic pathogens through the \u201cdilution effect\u201d. effects of deforestation on bat populations and communities could have major impacts on the emergence and circulation of infectious diseases. bats were more abundant in chacra (1,737 total captures) and in purma (1,290 captures) than in bosque (737 captures); this was driven primarily by increases in the abundances of frugivorous and nectarivorous bats. greater abundances of bats in chacra and purma may represent increased risk of transmission of diseases to humans. habitat conversion in the united states has increased risk of Lyme disease for humans due to increased abundances of its most competent reservoir. habitat loss in rural regions of Bangladesh has resulted in more bats roosting in buildings of small villages. no metrics of biodiversity differed between bosque and chacra during either season. mean abundance in chacra was lower during the wet season and higher during the dry season compared to contemporaneous mean abundances in bosque. the primary response by frugivores to chacra was for dominance to be higher than in bosque. chacra species composition differed from that of bosque only in the dry season. in chacra, two of these species (i.e., Tr. nicefori, and To. saurophila) were rare. in chacra, one (P. hastatus) more than doubled in relative abundance. zoonoses have been recorded from Car. perspicillata in the Neotropics. zoonotic outbreaks have occurred in other regions in similar circumstances. habitat conversion in the united states has increased risk of Lyme disease. for frugivores, RADs differed between bosque and chacra in both seasons. for most part, this difference occurred because of the higher relative abundance of the dominant species in chacra compared to bosque. chacra supported greater bosque rarity than did bosque itself. the primary response by frugivores to chacra was for dominance to be higher than in bosque, with the same dominant species (Car. perspicillata) in both habitats. such dynamics did not characterize gleaning animalivores. differences between purma and bosque were greater during the dry season (E = 1.7, H\u2032 = 3.6, D = 1.8) than during the wet season (E = 1.6, H\u2032 = 2.9, D = 1.0) at the -level, metrics of taxonomic biodiversity differed between purma and bosque as well. the situation was different for gleaning animalivores. a difference between the two habitat types in species composition was evident only in the dry season. differences in RADs between purma and purma depended on season. differences in relative abundances of species ranked two (0.1 in purma, 0.2 in bosque) and three (0.1 in purma, and 0.2 in bosque) differences between purma and bosque were much greater in the dry season (E = 4.8, H\u2032 = 4.5, D = 3.8) small-scale agriculture (e.g., chacras) may not negatively affect species richness for frugivores or gleaning animalivores at larger spatial scales. extent to which this is true would likely diminish as total area of closed-canopy forest decreases. extent to which abandonment of agricultural plots and secondary succession are reduced and impaired, respectively, and the intensity of and total area devoted to agriculture increases. from 2007 to 2013 alone, 248 novel viruses belonging to 24 viral families were described from bats. the Neotropics have been under sampled compared to other tropical regions. the effects of deforestation on bat populations and communities could have major impacts on the emergence and circulation of infectious diseases. exterior subplots were erected to sample bats from bosque, chacra, and purma habitats near Iquitos, Peru. diagram is drawn to scale, with each interior subplot measuring 75 m 75 m. the yellow shaded area identifies the threshold for relative abundance. comparisons that were significant (P 0.05) or approached significance (0.10 > P 0.05) are bold, indicating contrasts that most contributed to overall differences between habitats. striped bars represent the dominant species (most abundant), gray bars represent common species (nondominant species with a relative frequency 1/S, where S is species richness) and black bars represent rare species (species with a relative frequency 1/S)"}
