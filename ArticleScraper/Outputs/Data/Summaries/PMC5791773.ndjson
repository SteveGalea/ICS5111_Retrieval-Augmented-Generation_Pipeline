{"summary": "a total of 44 lessons learnt across the eight core capacities of IHR (2005). major themes included the need to mobilize and sustain political commitment. we did not find specific areas of weakness in monitoring IHR (2005). several outbreaks, epidemics and pandemics have been declared public health emergencies of international concern. IHR (2005) requires countries to develop, strengthen and maintain eight core public health capacities. by the end of 2015, 127 of the 192 countries had not met all core capacity requirements. we systematically evaluated published literature and reports for lessons learned from national experience in implementing IHR (2005). we systematically searched the PubMed\u00ae, Embase\u00ae, Global Health, Scopus and WHO Global Index Medicus databases without any limitations of language, publication type or date. management for IHR preparedness Core capacity 6: Risk communication Component 6A: Policy and procedures for public communications Component 8B: Laboratory diagnostic and confirmation capacity Component 8C: Laboratory biosafety and laboratory biosecurity. core capacity 1: national legislation, policy and financing Component 1B: Financing Core capacity 2: Coordination and national focal point communications Component 2A: IHR coordination, communication and advocacy Core capacity 3: Surveillance Component 3A: Indicator-based surveillance Component 3B: Event-based surveillance Core capacity 4: Response Component 4A: Rapid response capacity Component 4D: Disinfection, decontamination and vector control. a total of 44 lessons learned from the eligible articles were synthesized from the eligible articles (Box 2; Box 3). some of the included articles did not report on all eight core capacities of the IHR (2005). of IHR (2005) N/A 2, 5, 7 May et al., 200955 2009 2009 Australia, Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Costa Rica, China, Taiwan, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Egypt, Eritrea, French Guiana, Indonesia, Jamaica, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Peru, Solomon Islands, United Republic of Tanzania, Uganda, USA and Vanuatu Africa, Americas, Eastern Mediterranean, South-east Asia and Western Pacific Qualitative study of the application of on the existing programme and projected human resource needs N/A 1, 7 Kant & Krishnan, 201045 2010 2010 India South-East Asia Evaluation of the status and progress of IHR (2005) implementation N/A 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 Katz & Kornblet, 201047 2007\u20132010 2010 Australia, Canada, Germany and India Americas, South-East Asia, Europe and Western Pacific Assessment of IHR (2005) implementation strategies 7 1, 2, 3, 5 Masanza et al., 201054 2007\u20132010 2010 Bur evaluation of progress and challenges in implementation of IHR (2005) N/A 1 Kool et al., 201228 2010\u20132012 2012 Pacific Island States and Territoriesc Western Pacific Case study of the syndromic surveillance system. analysis of syndromic data reported to WHO by all participating territories 8 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 Rajatonirina et al., 201263 2007\u20132011 2012 Madagascar Africa Case study of the surveillance system NA 2, 3, 6, 7 Teixeira et al a 1,3,4,5,7,8 Gheorghita & Caterinciuc, 201336 Not reported 2013 Republic of Moldova Europe Case study of a national electronic reporting and surveillance system N/A 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 Hadjichristodouloua et al., 201338 2008\u20132011 2013 European Union Europe Evaluation of a needs assessment project, a manual of european standards and best practices. of the United Kingdom Americas, South-East Asia and Europe Evaluation of status of IHR (2005) compliance and appropriate measures to ensure compliance by June 2014 6 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8 Priotto et al., 201461 2010\u20132011 2014 Morocco Eastern Mediterranean Evaluation of a strategy to strengthen the surveillance system and workforce 8 1, 2, 3, 7 Stewart-Evans et al., 201467 Not reported 2013 European Union Europe Qualitative study of exposure assessment capabilities and communication pathways between exposure assessors and public health risk assess not reported 2015 Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Sweden and United Kingdom Europe Evaluation of the benefits and pitfalls of syndromic surveillance N/A 3 IHR: International Health Regulation; N/A: not applicable; WHO: World Health Organization. studies included in the systematic review of the implementation of the international health regulations (2005).
