{"summary": "bovine respiratory disease is the leading cause of death in weaned dairy heifers. it is the second most common cause of mortality in pre-weaned calves in cattle herds in the united states. infections of the upper or lower respiratory tract may be challenging to detect earlier in the disease course. despite the variability of presentation, the observation of clinical signs is the most common method used to identify cattle. clinical scoring systems use information that can be rapidly collected from patients to assess patient health and prognosis. the patient\u2019s total score, in turn, should correspond to their risk or likelihood of disease. clinical signs that are difficult to measure with adequate precision should not be included. the score described by Thomas et al. (1977) is ill-suited for field work because it uses 17 predictors, hematologic data, and requires observations specific to the pre-inoculation described in their study. the WI score subdivides each of its clinical signs into 4 levels, which may have ambiguous overlap to inexperienced individuals making it difficult to appropriately classify clinical signs in calves. study population and sampling study calves were enrolled on a calf raising facility in the San Joaquin Valley. all bull and steer calves raised on the facility were purchased from dairies and raised for beef. calves were typically 1\u20132 days old at arrival and were segregated according to size and weight. Approximately 25 rows (12,000 calves) of calves were eligible for enrollment on any day during the study. only 4\u20136 rows per day could be evaluated due to time limitations. calves suspected to have BRD were not enrolled if they had WI scores of 4 or less. each calf was assigned the sum of the nasal discharge, rectal temperature, cough scores and the greater one of the two scores from the ocular discharge and head/ear carriage. clinical signs beyond those used in the WI score were also observed and recorded. a guarded polyester swab was placed through a single naris and into the nasopharynx of each calf. this swab tip was stored in the same vial of viral transport media. the vial was sealed and stored on wet ice until daily sampling was completed. samples for mycoplasma spp. were identified by colony morphology and confirmed with digitonin. the media used for sample collection and storage was supplied by the university of California Davis\u2019 Biological Media Service. bovine coronavirus was not included as a criterion for case definition because current PCR assays could not differentiate between enteric and respiratory BCoV subtypes. the algorithm for the classification of BRD cases and controls. the effects of these correlated factors were conditioned out of the analysis. the resulting odds ratios compare the odds of the presence of a clinical sign severity level in a case to the odds of the presence of the clinical sign severity in a pair-matched control calf. rectal temperatures below the reported normal physiologic lower limit, 38.1\u00b0C, were not considered to be abnormal for the purposes of this study. additional clinical predictors were recorded as present or absent, and were coded 1 and 0, respectively. the final selected models were used as the source to generate the score weights for the clinical signs included in the final model. the magnitude of Sp was defined as the value of the corresponding regression coefficient on the natural logarithm scale rounded to the nearest integer. study population and sampling study calves were enrolled on a calf raising facility. calves were vaccinated with a modified-live intranasal vaccine against BHV-1 and PI3 upon arrival, at approximately one day of age. a 5-way modified-live parenteral vaccine against BHV-1, BVDV types 1 & 2, BRSV was administered at approximately one day of age. calves treated with antibiotics were not eligible to be enrolled for 10 days after final treatment due to concerns that treatment could affect bacterial culture results. Approximately 25 rows (12,000 calves) were eligible for enrollment on any day during the study, however, only 4\u20136 rows per day could be evaluated due to time limitations. clinical signs scored \u201c0\u201d are considered clinically normal. score 0 1 2 3 Cough None Single induced Multiple spontaneous Nasal discharge None Small amount of unilateral cloudy discharge Bilateral, cloudy, or excessive mucus discharge Copious bilateral mucopurulent discharge Ocular discharge None Small amount of ocular discharge Moderate amount of bilateral discharge Heavy ocular discharge Ear & Head carriage Normal carriage ear flick or head shake slight unilateral droop Head tilt or bilateral droop Rectal temperature (F swabs for bacterial cultures and viral detection via PCR were collected from the calves\u2019 upper respiratory tracts. an unguarded polyester swab was placed through a single naris and into the nasopharynx of each calf, repeatedly passed over the nasal mucosa. the tip was stored in the same vial of viral transport media. plasma bacterial cultures were performed by plating broth onto blood and chocolate agar plates at 37\u00b0C for 48 h. individual colonies were re-plated and cultured for identification. organisms were identified based on colony morphology. bovine coronavirus was not included as a criterion for case definition because current PCR assays could not differentiate between enteric and respiratory BCoV subtypes. bovine coronavirus was not included as a criterion for case definition. pair identifiers from the original study were used to define pairs. the distribution of date of birth, source farm, and age were similar in cases and controls due to the association between these factors and calf location. the effects of these correlated factors were conditioned out of the analysis. rectal temperatures below the reported normal physiologic lower limit, 38.1\u00b0C, were not considered to be abnormal for the purposes of this study. the remaining clinical signs (cough, nasal discharge, ocular discharge, head/ear carriage) were categorical predictors, and recoded into sets of dichotomous dummy variables. all comparisons were considered significant at an alpha less than 0.05. the final selected models were used as the source to generate the score weights for the clinical signs. Cohen\u2019s kappa coefficients were calculated as a measure of inter-rater agreement between the results of each scoring system developed and the WI system. kappa coefficient values less than 0.4 indicated poor agreement beyond chance, and values between 0.4 and 0.75 indicated fair to good agreement beyond chance. twenty-eight pairs contained 2 cases and 166 pairs contained 2 controls. depression was noted in 530 (61.0%) cases and 54 (4.4%) controls. a pair-matched OR for depression was 171.7 (95% CI: (55.2, 534.0), p 0.0005) logistic regression models BRD1 The first model selection process started with a model that included all levels of severity for the cough, nasal discharge, ocular discharge, and head and ear position clinical signs as described in the WI BRD score. the variables for cough, nasal discharge, and ocular discharge were each dichotomized with a referent level for normal signs. clinical sign Level p S.E.

All coefficient estimates in the model were significant except for the estimated coefficient for ocular discharge (p = 0.69) but removal of the ocular discharge term caused a significant change in model fit (G2 = 3.91, p = 0.048) and was therefore retained in the final model. the third model was fit using the following dichotomized variables. nasal discharge dichotomized with normal signs (WI score 0) as the referent level versus any abnormal discharge (WI score 1, 2, or 3), cough dichotomized with no spontaneous cough (WI score 0 or part of 2) as the referent level versus any spontaneous cough (WI score part of 2 or 3), rectal temperature dichotomized as described above. standardized Z-score (Z) and 2-sided significance of the Z-score (p) and weighting score factors for the BRD3 clinical scoring system (Sp) developed from the model based on 809 pairs of Holstein calves (1618 calves in total) prior to weaning and housed on a calf ranch in California\u2019s San Joaquin Valley. the BRD3 model dichotomized the cough variable to eliminate laryngeal palpation from the system as was done in the BRD2 model. the final BRD3 model with the variables forced resulted in a slightly higher AIC value compared to BRD1. the final BRD3 model with the variables forced resulted in a slightly higher AIC value compared to BRD1 and a fit similar to BRD2 models.

Sullivan, Massaro & D\u2019Agostino, 2004; however the pair-matched case-control design of the current study was incompatible with Sullivan\u2019s method. the scoring systems provide three options to assess the BRD status of pre-weaned dairy calves.
