{"summary": "neurotropic flaviviruses are causative agents of severe brain-related diseases including meningitis, encephalitis, and microcephaly. we have previously shown that local type I interferon response within the central nervous system is involved in the protection of mice against tick-borne flavivirus infection. however, the cells responsible for mounting this protective response are not defined. astrocyte supernatant from TBEV-infected cells can restrict TBEV growth in astrocytes already 6 h post infection. effect on neurons is highly reinforced, and astrocyte supernatant from 3 h post infection is already protective."}
