{"summary": "7 (7%) with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV infection were enrolled. 19 (18%) were excluded for various reasons. household contacts were defined as persons who had lived in the same household with SARS case-patients during their illness. participants were asked to provide whole-blood, serum, stool, urine, nasopharyngeal, and oropharyngeal swab specimens. participants provided a 50-mL clean-catch collection of urine in a sterile urine cup. quantitative RT-PCR was performed using the TaqMan assay and standard curves generated from synthetic RNA transcripts. overlapping RT-PCR products were generated by using the SuperScript One-Step RT-PCR with Platinum Taq (invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) household contacts were defined as persons who had lived in the same household with case-patients during their illness. follow-up visits were scheduled twice a week for the first 3 weeks after illness onset. if a case-patient was first enrolled after week 5 of illness, then a follow-up visit was made as soon as feasible after enrollment. samples were collected by using a single Dacron swab with a nonwooden shaft. the swab was placed in a sterile vial containing 2 mL of viral transport medium. participants provided a 50-mL clean-catch collection of urine in a sterile urine cup. frames of the S (8 products) and N (2 products) genes were generated by using the SuperScript One-Step RT-PCR with Platinum Taq (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and sequenced by using 16 (S gene) or 7 (N gene) sequencing primers. serum specimens were tested for SARS-CoV\u2013associated antibodies by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and an indirect fluorescent antibody test. Specimen type No. of specimens (no. of case-patients) by no. of days after illness onset Total no. of specimens 0\u201314 days 15\u201328 days >28 days Respiratory 11 (7) 12 (4) 18 (7) 41 Sputum 2 (2) 2 (1) 0 (0) 4 NP swab 5 (5) 4 (4) 9 (6) 18 OP swab 2 (2) 6 (4) 9 (7) 17 Nasal aspirate 1 (1) a total of 14 stool specimens were obtained from seven case-patients. two patients provided 4 samples each, one patient had 2 samples, and four had 1 sample each. the single positive stool specimen from case-patient 6 was obtained 19 days after onset. viral RNA was detected in all four of his stools. SARS-CoV antibody was first found as early as days 10 and 11 after illness onset in three of seven cases-patients. no viral RNA was detected by RT-PCR in any of the eight urine samples collected from the seven cases-patients. household Transmission Ten household contacts of five of the seven SARS cases-patients were enrolled. case-patient 1 had four household contacts, case-patients 3 and 4 had one such contact each. case-patients 6 and 7 had two household contacts each. the case-patient before hospitalization Protective measures by HHC No. of days in house with case-patient No. of nights in same room Contact within 3 feet (h/day) Skin-to-skin contact (times/day) case-patient 7 was hospitalized from day 11 to day 18 of illness. case-patient 6 had low-level shedding of SARS-CoV in stool on day 19. no virus was subsequently found in his stool specimens.

RNA was detected in five specimens, all of which came from two case-patients. no evidence was found that the virus mutated in case-patient 7 during the infection. no viral RNA was detected by RT-PCR in any of the eight urine specimens collected from the seven case-patients. household contacts of five of the seven cases-patients were enrolled. case-patient 1 had four household contacts, case-patients 3 and 4 had one such contact each. case-patients 6 and 7 had two household contacts each. case-patient identification no. (n=5) Shedding documented in case-patient Use of surgical mask by case-patient SARS-CoV infection in HHC. dShedding documented in stool on day 19 after onset of illness. eCase-patient 6 was never hospitalized. the remaining six uninfected household contacts reported close contact with case-patients. both case-patients also wore surgical masks during this period. case-patient 7 was hospitalized from day 11 to day 18 of illness. eces may be present in the form of either nonviable viral particles or antibody-coated virus. eces may be present in the form of either nonviable viral particles or antibody-coated virus. the incubation period for SARS ranges from 2 to 10 days (4,17) but in some cases, the incubation period may be 14 days (18) the inability to detect SARS-CoV in urine may be the result of a late collection of urine specimens (>14 days after illness onset) a wider use of steroids in treatment of case-patients in Hong Kong compared with case-patients in the united states may have altered the pattern of shedding of SARS-CoV. possible variations in specimen collection and handling techniques could also have affected SARS-CoV detection rates in respiratory and stool specimens. the early laboratory diagnosis of SARS-CoV infection is difficult; optimal timing for specimen collection and currently available diagnostic tests need to be refined further."}
