{"summary": "four human coronaviruses (HCoV; 229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1) are endemic in the human population. another two human coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, cause severe respiratory syndromes and present a significant threat with their high fatality rates. over 70% of the general public has seroconverted towards all four non-severe HCoVs with primary infection shown to occur in childhood. human coronaviruses represent a substantial disease burden, exacerbated by the high implications of healthcare workers in coronavirus outbreaks. the first generation of 3CLpro inhibitors were irreversible peptidomimetic structures, often five residues in length with at reactive warhead at the terminus. these reactive warheads have included Michael acceptors [20,21,22], aldehydes [23], epoxy-ketones [24], halo-methyl ketones [25], and trifluoromethyl ketones [26]. the use of covalent inhibitors is however limited due there propensity for off-target side the sidechains of the S3 site are solvent-exposed and therefore this site is expected to tolerate a wide range of functionality. a typical cleavage recognition site is therefore (Ser, Ala)-(Val, Thr)-Leu-Glu (Ser, Ala, Gly), which is conserved among all coronavirus 3CLpro [36]. the receptor grid was generated around the superimposed ligand to accurately encompass the binding pocket. the grid box was generated 10 in each direction and a constraint was set for the ligand to form a hydrogen bond. Ligands which did not fulfil this constraint were automatically excluded. a binding score cut-off, defined as 7 kcal/mol, was defined by determining the free energy of binding of a known inhibitor. features included an essential hydrogen bond with the His163 residue and a hydrophobic moiety in the P2 position. excluded volumes of 1 were set to better consider the steric effects. a binding energy of 80 kcal/mol was used as a cut-off. the hydrogen bond constraint in the S1 pocket was again applied to discriminate between potential binders and non-binders. short range electrostatic and van der Waals cutoffs were 1.0 nm and 1.4 nm respectively. coordinates, velocities and energies were saved every 0.2 ps. pressure coupling during NVT equilibration was achieved via the Parrinello-Rahman algorithm. grid box for searching was centered on the active His41 residue. grid box spacing set to 1 and extended 26 grid points in each direction. lowest binding score corresponded to a binding affinity of 9.5 kcal/mol. binding score cut-off, defined as 7 kcal/mol, was used to filter the hit-list. a binding free energy cut-off was defined by determining the free energy of binding of a known active inhibitor. a total of four pharmacophoric features were required within the excluded volumes of 1. features included an essential hydrogen bond with the His163 residue and a hydrophobic moiety in the P2 and P3 pocket. a binding energy of 80 kcal/mol was used as a cut-off. the hydrogen bond constraint in the S1 pocket was again applied to discriminate between potential binders and non-binders. s were 1.0 nm and 1.4 nm respectively. coordinates, velocities and energies were saved every 0.2 ps. pressure coupling during NVT equilibration was achieved via the parrinello-Rahman algorithm. the 3CLpro was previously solved by X-ray crystallography to a resolution of 2.5 in complex with a peptidomimetic, covalent inhibitor. a total of four chains, two chains form the active dimeric structure. each chain contains the covalent inhibitor bound to the active site which undergoes nucleophilic attack of the active cysteine S to form an irreversible, covalent bond. binding mode of a known, experimental inhibitor for the class of enzymes studied. a previously solved experimental structure with a bound, noncovalent inhibitor is required. a previously solved experimental structure with a bound, noncovalent inhibitor is required. a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 0.244 for Vina and 0.79 for Glide suggests that they are well calibrated for this class of enzyme and should achieve a high level of accuracy. the overall predicted pose of Vina corresponds to the experimental pose with a high level of accuracy. molecular docking Vina was selected as the receptor to identify the highly refined subset of potential inhibitors. this receptor possessed the largest binding pocket of all structures when analyzed by SiteMap. the lowest binding score within this hit-list corresponds to 9.5 kcal/mol. all ligands which achieved this score were also included in the study, yielding a total of 1527 hit compounds. the initial phase of refinement included redocking with Glide and GOLD and scoring with their respective scoring functions and MM-GBSA. the final hit-list with MM-GBSA identified 22 ligands that passed all filters and pharmacophoric constraints for the 2ZU2 receptor. this included a total of three sampling algorithms and four scoring functions from Vina, Glide and GOLD. this included two pharmacophoric constraints with a hydrogen bond acceptor in the S1 pocket and a hydrophobic moiety filling the S2 pocket. the pharmacophore model only filters compounds based on the presence of a hydrogen bond acceptor in the P1 position and a hydrophobic moiety in the P2 position. non-essential features included a hydrogen bond donor and acceptor in the P4 and P3 pockets. MM-GBSA further reduced its size to 15 compounds with the previously defined cut-off value. initial attempts to redock these hits into the individual binding pockets proved highly unsuccessful. Neither the binding mode nor binding affinity or free energy of binding could be replicated for any complex studied. steric clashes with the ligand were refined using the Prime module of Schr\u00f6dinger. the ligand was then minimized within the pocket to remove any further steric clashes. the binding mode predicted using this approach was then assessed using the pharmacophoric constraints of a hydrogen bond in the S1 and a hydrophobic moiety in the S2 pockets. 106.1 95.8 96.4 20130947 9.5 9.04 74.43 83.6 0.03 0.045 90.1 96.0 88.4 87.7 15987063 9.8 8.34 68.43 82.3 6.89 0.007 91.0 91.1 79.3 87.3 02466851 9.5 8.92 75.65 100.3 7.14 0.01 98.0 104.3 79.7 89.8 12798320 9.6 8.18 72.81 89.5 1.48 0.006 MM-GBSA 3D23 2ZU2 3V3M 3TLO OC43 09411012 85.2 84.6 81.9 77.5 90.9 02426719 103.0 80.7 85.5 73.7 109.3 02094118 83.3 90.8 69.8 82.8 102.8 09346433 92.5 79.2 81.9 63.1 103.4 ML188 85.2 77.4 83.1 78.5 85.3 Table 2. similarity scores were calculated from alignments generated using shape + feature and ten conformers per ligand. the dendogram was generated using shape + feature and ten conformers per ligand. OC43 3CLpro exhibited a fourth hydrogen bond via the backbone carbonyl and ligand NH. the residue is conserved in 3D23 and 3V3M structures, however it was orientated towards the solvent exposed exterior of the pocket. the position of Gln189 is replaced by Pro188/9, which therefore did not contribute to the formation of a bond. the bond formed between Glu189 and the N4 of the 1,2,4-triazole exhibits a relatively low occupancy of 17.95%. the compound does provide an excellent scaffold for lead optimization. further lead optimization may explore the replacement of the pyridine ring with the related lactam ring. the ligand is stable within the active site of the 3CLpro. a pyridine ring fills the S1 pocket and formed a hydrogen bond with the imidazole N2 of His162/3. a backbone carbonyl of these residues was perfectly aligned allowing the formation of the hydrogen bond in all structures. ligand was a solvent exposed 1,3-dioxolane, which made few interactions with surrounding residues. further lead optimization steps may explore the removal of this substituent to ascertain any structure-activity relationship. the position of Ala143 in 2ZU2 is transformed to Ser in 3V3M, 3D23 and OC43 3CLpro. this suggests that the hydrophobic sidechain of the Ala in 2ZU2 may have promoted the movement towards the pyridine. the orientation of the pyridine ring in 3TLO is somewhat stabilized by a bifurcated interaction with the sidechain of Glu166. the sidechain of Gln189 was shown to form a hydrogen bond with the ligand in 3V3M, 3D23 and OC43 3CLpro. in 3V3M the ligand was however able to stabilize the sidechain to maintain the formation of the bond with a high degree of frequency at 73%. the apo form of the NL63 3CLpro was solved in its dimeric form by X-ray crystallography to a high resolution of 1.6. the corresponding crystallographic structure shows a dimeric structure with the inhibitor, zinc N-ethyl-N-phenyldithiocarbamate (EPDTC), coordinated to the catalytic dyad residues of His41 and Cys144 with a zinc-centered tetrahedral geometry structure represented the only coronavirus 3CLpro with a noncovalent inhibitor. a previously solved experimental structure with a bound, noncovalent inhibitor is required. a previously solved experimental structure with a bound, noncovalent inhibitor is required for virtual screening. the structure of 3V3M represented the only noncovalent inhibitor of modest size that we could identify from the PDB. a RMSD below 2 for heavy atoms between the experimental structure and predicted pose of docking is a well-defined benchmark to assess the accuracy of molecular docking sampling algorithms. the overall predicted pose of Vina corresponds to the experimental pose. Glide was also capable of accurately predicting the pose of ML188 within the pocket of 3V3M within an RMSD of 0.79. this indicates that sampling by both Vina and Glide are well calibrated for the class of enzyme studied. Molecular Docking Vina was selected as the receptor to identify the highly refined subset of potential inhibitors. this receptor possessed the largest binding pocket of all structures when analyzed by SiteMap. the primary hit-list consisted of the top 1500 ranked compounds from the high throughput virtual screen (HTVS) of the drugs-Now dataset conducted by Vina. bound inhibitor ML188 achieved a binding affinity estimation of 8.1 kcal/mol when bound to 3V3M. at this stage the hit-list was refined to a point where the binding pose of each hit could be analyzed by manual inspection. each ligand identified in the hit-list met these pharmacophoric constraints. the pharmacophore model was based largely on a single covalent inhibitor. this inhibitor was chosen as it possesses several favorable noncovalent features for the generation of a pharmacophore model. non-essential features included a hydrogen bond acceptor in the P1 and a hydrophobic moiety in the P2 pocket. molecular operating environment (MOE) was used to generate the pharmacophore model. only ligands satisfying the pharmacophore within an RMSD of 0.5 where filtered to the initial hit-list. the protonation of the ligands generated several steric clashes within the active pocket of 3D23. residue sidechains inserting into the active pocket were highly variable. orientation of the sidechains is variable between structures, which hinder ligand binding. in molecular docking this process is circumvented by the static nature of the receptor. this final list of 19 ligands represented 15 distinct clusters. free energy of binding between a known active inhibitor, ML188, and respective coronavirus 3CLpro is also shown in Table 1 and Table 2. 72 75.80 86.0 4.09 0.005 98.0 88.4 77.3 84.1 32983195 9.5 7.02 65.44 82.7 0.98 2.27 81.6 79.4 73.1 77.8 09104621 9.8 7.33 70.91 83.3 1.20 0.002 79.6 100.6 69.4 87.7 02328322 9.7 8.53 75.37 81.8 0.94 0.01 89.2 85.5 73.8 83.7 12550995 MM-GBSA 3D23 2ZU2 3V3M 3TLO OC43 09411012 85.2 84.6 81.9 77.5 90.9 02426719 103.0 80.7 85.5 77.5 90.9 02094118 103.0 80.7 85.5 73.7 109.3 02094118 83.3 90.8 69.8 82.8 102.8 09346433 92.5 79.2 81.9 63.1 103.4 ML188 85.2 77.4 83.1 lecular dynamic simulations are extremely computer intensive. one representative ligand identified from molecular docking. the ability of molecular dynamic simulations to replicate the binding conformation and ligand stability would verify that the identified hit-list does in fact represent likely actives. OC43 3CLpro and 3D23 observed the lowest occupancy of 13.63% and 7.27% respectively. 2ZU2 and 3TLO also formed hydrogen bonds with moderate frequency with Gln191/2. bond formed between Glu189 and the 1,2,4-triazole exhibits relatively low occupancy of 17.95%. the pyridine ring with the related lactam ring is known to mediate two hydrogen bonds, one between the ligand carbonyl and the His162/3 N2 and a second hydrogen bond between the lactam NH and Glu166. the presence of this second hydrogen bond and van der Waals interactions, mediated via ring substituents, may further stabilize the compound within the S1 pocket. the backbone NH of Glu165/6 again formed a hydrogen bond with a ligand carbonyl. a fourth hydrogen bond is observed in 3V3M, 3D23 and OC43 3CLpro between the sidechain of Gln189 and a ligand carbonyl. the pyridine ring gradually dissociated out of the S1 pocket at around 4 ns. the 1,3-dioxolane became completely solvent exposed. the two methyl groups that filled the hydrophobic S2 pocket remained the only substructures to maintain any structural conformation in the active subsite. the orientation of all S1 subsite residues including His162, Phe139, Glu165, His171 and Tyr160 remained unaltered. a phenylalanine substituent, imidazole or lactam ring in this position may also contribute positively to the stability of the ligand within the active pocket. the position of 164, occupied by a His in 3V3M and a Gln in the remaining structures showed varying degrees of bond formation. complexes, including 3V3M and 3D23, observed significant fluctuations within their stable conformation which was largely attributed to the presence of the solvent exposed dioxolane moiety. RMSD results where all structures fluctuate between 4.7 and 5.0, with the exception of 2ZU2 which deterred greatly at approximately 6 ns. the residue is conserved in 3D23 and 3V3M structures. it was orientated towards the solvent exposed exterior of the pocket. in 2ZU2 and 3TLO the position of Gln189 is replaced by Pro188/9. the bond formed between Glu189 and the N4 of the 1,2,4-triazole exhibits a relatively low occupancy of 17.95%. results achieved from molecular dynamics were in relatively strong agreement with that of molecular docking. the compound does provide an excellent scaffold for lead optimization. further lead optimization may explore the replacement of the pyridine ring with the related lactam ring. ligand fluctuated within 4.6 and 4.9 for all structures. this again indicated that the ligand is stable within the pocket. a pyridine ring fills the S1 pocket and formed a hydrogen bond with the imidazole N2 of His162/3. a potential problematic feature of this ligand was a solvent exposed 1,3-dioxolane, which made few interactions with surrounding residues. further optimization steps may explore the removal of this substituent to ascertain any structure-activity relationship. position of pyridine in 2ZU2 is transformed to ser in 3V3M, 3D23 and OC43 3CLpro. orientation of the pyridine ring in 2TLO is stabilized by bifurcated interaction with the sidechain of Glu166 which promoted the movement of the pyridine N away from Ala143 without disrupting the interaction with His162. the sidechain of Gln189 was shown to form a hydrogen bond with the ligand in 3V3M, 3D23 and OC43 3CLpro. however this residue was highly solvent exposed and therefore resulted in a high degree of flexibility of the sidechain. RMSD again showed similar profiles to previously described complexes. discussions Lead compounds that have shown promise as potential inhibitors of the 3CLpro of coronaviruses are largely represented by peptidomimetic compounds that covalently alter the thiolate anion of the active Cys residue. there remains no commercially available molecular entity for the treatment of coronaviruses. ligand inactivity may be a result of a single misplaced substituent. pharmacophoric constraints, including an acceptor in the P1 and hydrophobic moiety in the P2, would be expected to generate a hit-list with similar scaffolds. the final hit-list, containing a total of 19 ligands (15 from molecular docking and four identified by pharmacophore modeling), however were highly divergent and represented 15 distinct clusters. the pyridine ring that fills the S1 pocket in 3V3M is stable in both modelled ligand-protein complexes and with the known inhibitor, ML188. however, with the remaining 3CLpro, several complexes showed instability of the pyridine ring within the S1 pocket. future lead optimization explores the effects of incorporating a lactam ring in this position. structure-based and ligand-based drug design approaches have developed into valuable drug discovery tools. predictions from virtual screening methods are not meant to replace experimental affinity determination, but can complement the experimental methods by producing an enriched subset of a large chemical database."}
