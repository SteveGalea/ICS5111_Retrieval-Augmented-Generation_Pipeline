{"summary": "PCR has become the gold standard test for detection of many viral, fungal, parasitic, and bacterial pathogens, surpassing virus isolation and bacterial culture methods in sensitivity. PCR assays are highly sensitive and specific, but their use can be costly, especially when testing for multiple pathogens (5). targeted NGS refers to selective capture or amplification of specific genomic regions of interest prior to massive parallel sequencing. selectively sequencing pathogens of interest provides better sensitivity, better specificity, ease of downstream analysis, and lower cost by allowing more samples to be tested in one run (10). targeted NGS has been applied successfully in cancer diagnostics (11\u201313) the white Glove team designed multiple primers for most of the targeted organisms to provide redundancy. we designed multiple primers for most of the targeted organisms to provide redundancy. campylobacter fetus subsp. fetus subsp. venerealis and Campylobacter fetus subsp. venerealis. fetus subsp. fetus subsp. fetus subsp. venerealis. fetus subsp. fetus subsp. fetus subsp. venerealis. TVDIL is accredited by the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians. we initially evaluated the panel by sequencing reference strains and known isolates of bacteria, parasites, fungi, and viruses to determine the specificity of the method. primer pools were redesigned to contain alternate primer sets for poorly sequencing targets. library preparation, template preparation, and chip loading were performed using the Ion Chef instrument. the kit allowed the preparation of 8 barcoded Ion Ampliseq libraries per Ion Chef run (8 different clinical cases) in about 7 h, depending on the number of cycles used for target amplification. sequencer with the Ion PGM Hi-Q sequencing kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in about 4 h, with 15 min hands-on time. a negative extraction control (NEC) was used to detect any contamination. a reference file containing the sequences of targeted pathogens and a bed file based on the locations of the designed primers were constructed and uploaded to the Torrent suite software. the assay was evaluated by testing validated isolates/reference strains of all the pathogens (bacteria, parasites, fungi, and viruses) that can be detected using the panel. a sample known to contain one pathogen based on previous testing was spiked with equal amounts of three or more of the tested isolates. the clinical cases included 16 mastitis cases, 15 respiratory cases, 20 enteric cases (2 caprine and 18 bovine), and 9 reproductive/abortion cases (1 caprine and 8 bovine) the overall agreement and Cohen's kappa were assessed by looking across all the pathogens that can be detected by the new assay as a group. influenza virus type D B Parainfluenza virus type 3 (strain SF-4) A Rotavirus A (strain Nebraska) Adenovirus type 3 C Mannheimia haemolytica C Trueperella pyogenes C Bibersteinia trehalosi C Histophilus somni C Mycoplasma spp. ae C Streptococcus uberis C Nocardia spp. (N. nova tested) C Klebsiella spp. (K. pneumoniae tested) C Anaplasma marginale C Neospora caninum G Toxoplasma gondii G Tritrichomonas fetus. total nucleic acid was isolated using the DNeasy blood and tissue kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), which has been shown to extract both DNA and RNA. a modification of the animal tissue protocol was employed, adding the following step: following mechanical disruption of the tissue, the sample supernatant was transferred to a bead tube and vortexed for 10 min. the kit allowed the preparation of 8 barcoded Ion Ampliseq libraries per Ion Chef run (8 different clinical cases) in about 7 h, depending on the number of cycles used for target amplification. then, 50 pM of the 8 mixed libraries was templated and loaded on an Ion 314 chip with the Ion PGM Hi-Q Chef kit. pathogen identifications were confirmed with NCBI BLAST. both analytical sensitivity (LOD) and specificity were determined to test the analytical performance of the assay. clinical cases included 16 mastitis cases, 15 respiratory cases, 20 enteric cases (2 caprine and 18 bovine), and 9 reproductive/abortion cases (1 caprine and 8 bovine) the relative PPA and NPA were assessed with respect to conventional/reference methods as a group. RESULTS The new assay was able to specifically detect the genes of interest of all the isolates of the bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses that were included in the panel. the relative limits of detection of the various group (bacterial/viral/parasitic DNA and viral RNA) representatives were threshold cycle values of 30 to 38 (Table 2). in 2 out of 9 reproductive cases, the targeted NGS assay was able to detect toxoplasma gondii and Neospora caninum, which were missed by DFAT. in one of the reproductive cases, the targeted NGS assay was not able to detect Campylobacter fetus subsp. fetus, which was detected in moderate numbers using a Campylobacter-specific culture technique, but interestingly, this sample also tested negative for in the enteritis group, the PPA for Cryptosporidium was 100% and the NPA was 88%. in the enteric and respiratory syndromes, the PPA was 70% and the NPA was 56%. for respiratory cases, the PPA for Mannheimia haemolytica was 78% and the NPA was 67%. targeted NGS was able to detect biothreat pathogens with as little as 10 copies/ml in a sample that contained multiple pathogens and was spiked with human genome. the bovine targeted NGS panel was able to detect pathogens that gave a CT value as high as 38. the test is intended to detect organisms associated with clinical disease. the primers for those organisms were not included in the panel. it is important to note the scalability of the assay. additional primers can be added up to a total of 24,000 targets per tube. positive rotavirus DFAT results in 3 enteric cases that were negative by commercial rotavirus A-specific qRT-PCR indicate that DFAT is problematic as a diagnostic tool for rotavirus. DFAT falsely detected BHV-4 in two respiratory cases. DFAT failed to detect RSV in 2 cases in which it was detected. the targeted NGS assay was able to detect BVD virus vaccine strains in 2 cases that were not detected by DFAT and qRT-PCR. this result demonstrates the ability of the assay to type the BVD present in the samples. the routine method for the diagnosis of C. fetus is the culture and identification of the causative organism. the identification of isolates is problematic due to the limited biochemical activity of the bacteria. the assay was able to detect multiple pathogens in caprine samples. targeted NGS offers the scalability, speed, reproducibility, and resolution to detect targeted genes of interest. targeted gene sequencing produces a smaller, more manageable data set than whole-genome sequencing, making analysis easier (16)."}
