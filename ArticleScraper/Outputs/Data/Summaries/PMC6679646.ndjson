{"summary": "biochar is produced by pyrolysis from various types of biomass in a low-to-no oxygen thermal process at temperatures ranging from 350 to 1,000 \u00b0C. when produced from pure stem wood, the solid phase of the pyrogenic process is known as charcoal. the term biochar indicates that a broad spectrum of biogenic materials can serve as feedstock. biochar, activated carbon and charcoal can all be considered as pyrogenic carbon materials. blending biochar with organic amendments such as manure, cattle urine or compost may increase yields more significantly and in a broader spectrum of climates and soils. biochar becomes thus enhanced with organic nutrients which increases the economic viability of biochar application while providing numerous environmental benefits. biochar becomes thus a more efficient plant growth enhancing soil amendment, that improves the recycling of nutrients from organic residues of animal farming. cascading use of biochar in animal farming systems also reduces the environmentally harmful loss of ammonia through volatilization or nitrate through leaching. the european biochar foundation introduced a new biochar certification standard specifically for animal feed. when ingested orally, biochar has been shown to improve the nutrient intake efficacy, adsorb toxins and generally improve animal health. a number of scientific studies on biochar feeding have been published since 2010. works in English, German and French. only a small fraction of his experiences are published in peer-reviewed journals. authors assessed titles and abstracts of all retrieved references. authors included all studies that investigated biochar or charcoal or activated carbon in vivo as feed additive for improving performance and animal health. in total, 112 scientific studies on biochar effects in animal feeding were reviewed. p 0.05 was obtained in the respective study. charcoal and wood ashes have a beneficial effect, the former being greatly relished. manufacturers of these tonics claimed they would reduce digestive disorders, increase appetite and improve milk production. biochar products are used since at least 1880 in hog breading and since 1940 in feed for poultry. in nature, charcoal residues from wild fires can still be found years later. colobus monkeys reached the highest population density of all monkey species worldwide. the daily consumption of such wood-based biochar has no negative long-term effect at least not on these monkeys. the effects of activated carbon on bacteria and their toxins in the gastrointestinal tract are: Adsorption of proteins, amines and amino-acids. selective colonization of biochar with gram-negative bacteria might result in decreased endotoxin release as these toxins could be directly adsorbed by the colonized biochar. biochars act as geobatteries and geoconductors that can accept, store and mediate electrons from and for biochemical reactions. low temperature biochars (HTT of 400\u2013450 \u00b0C) function as geobatteries mainly due to their phenol and quinone surface groups. high temperature biochars (HTT >600\u00b0) are good electrical conductors. electrons do not exist in a free state under ambient environmental conditions. organisms always depend on the availability of both an electron donor and an acceptor to which surcharge electrons can be transferred. electrons do not exist in a free state under ambient conditions. biochar can act as both a sole electron mediator or synergistic electron mediator. redox reactions can be optimized by electron shuttles, such as humic acids or activated biochar. biochar can be temporarily oxidized or reduced by microbes. it can buffer situations with a lack of electron donors or terminal electron acceptors. a principal aim of feeding biochar to animals could thus be to overcome metabolic redox limitations by enhancing electron exchange between microbes. biochar has the function of a redox wheel in the digestive tract, comparable to FeIII\u2013FeII-redox wheels. it could act as an electron acceptor and donator coupling directly various biotic and abiotic redox-reactions. biochar contain, depending on the production process, a multitude of volatile organic carbons (VOC) biochar, pyrolytic vinegar and humic substances can act as redox buffering substances. biochar particles may thus provide selective hotspots of microbial activity. redox potential may be minimized in proximity of biochar particles. the mechanistic understanding of biochar used as feed additive is clearly in its infancy. however, we hypothesize with some confidence that biochar has a direct electro-chemical influence on digestive reactions. the higher the temperature above 600 \u00b0C, the better is the electron transfer rate and electrical conductivity. mycotoxins are mainly derived from mold fungi, whose growth on fresh and stored animal feed is difficult to prevent. adsorbents are usually added to the feed to bind the mycotoxins before ingestion. activated carbon and special polymers are increasingly being used to protect the animals. in vivo tests, an insufficiently characterized (activated) biochar was fed at a low concentration of 0.25% of the feed fresh weight. in the in vitro studies, the biochar was added at 1% to the aqueous solution, that is, four times higher. galvano et al. (1996a) also investigated the adsorption capacity of 19 different activated carbons for two mycotoxins. zearalenone, a dangerous estrogenic metabolite of the fungus species Fusarium, could be bound at each of the four biochar doses. in vitro, all zearalenone could be bound at each of the four biochar doses. in vivo, hardly any specific adsorption could be achieved. oxin reduced the transfer of the toxin (100 ppb) to the milk by 76%. in the latter trial, the efficiency of activated biochar was significantly higher than that of bentonite (65.2%). both adsorbents did not affect the composition of goat\u2019s milk nor the average level of milk production. activated biochar reduced the concentration of aflatoxin B in the feces of chickens for fattening, but only if the biochar was administered separately from the feed. the importance of dosage was confirmed in another recent poultry trial where 0.25% or 0.5% activated biochar was added to an aflatoxin B1 contaminated diet. activated carbon (Norit\u00ae, Boston, MA, USA) could sorb up to 200 g/kg aflatoxin. in a corn meal suspension, sorption capacity was 100 times lower due to matrix effects. negative effects of certain mycotoxins such as deoxynivalenol and zearalenone can be effectively suppressed with rather low dosages of activated biochar amended to feed. charcoal was fed to domestic animals as early as 1919. the feeding of 200 g of biochar per day did not show the same efficiency. a similar significant reduction of Clostridium botulinum antibodies in the blood could be measured. the in vivo test by Knutson et al. with the same activated biochar (DARCO-KB; Norit\u00ae) revealed no biochar-related binding of either E. coli or S. typhimurium in the gastrointestinal tract of sheep. the authors hypothesize that either the binding sites were occupied by competing substances or other digestive bacteria. contaminated soil mix was untraceable using a cultivation based assessment. chicken manure biochar prepared at 350 \u00b0C did not improve binding of either bacteria, but the addition of biochar prepared at 700 \u00b0C from pinewood or from chicken manure significantly reduced the spread of both bacteria. 3% bamboo biochar feed supplement suppressed the fecal excretion of gram-negative coliform bacteria and gram-negative Salmonella in pigs up to 1,100-fold compared to controls without biochar. the effect of biochar on the suppression of both bacterial species was of the same order of magnitude as that of antibiotics. the mortality of the young goats was 20% in the control group and only 6.7% in the treatment group that received Obionekk\u00ae three times per day. biochar feeding may also reduce the incidence of parasites such as cestode tapeworms and coccidia oocysts. doxycycline, tylosin, diclazuril, salinomycin, coccidiostats diclazuril and salinomycin. biochar is considered as animal feed additive. adsorption of glyphosate is a potent antibiotic activity. glyphosate sorbed by biochar from pure water could be remobilized. this finding indicates that biochar-sorbed glyphosate from feed may be remobilized in the digestive tract due to numerous ions competing for sorption sites. environment though it is banned now, resulted in a very significant reduction in the levels of Dieldrin and DDT in milkfat. however, fries et al. (1970) found no reduction in the levels of Dieldrin and DDT in milkfat when cows were fed one kg of activated biochar. Fujita et al. (2012) carried out an extensive experiment with 24 laying hens whose feed contained the organochlorine compounds mentioned above. concentrations of PCDDs/PCDFs, non-ortho PCBs and mono-ortho PCBs in the tissue and eggs of the laying hens could be reduced by more than 90%, 80% and 50%. in goats, feeding 50\u2013100 g of bamboo biochar per kg of a tannin-rich acacia leaf diet increased daily weight gain by 17% compared to control without biochar. the authors found that digestion of crude proteins and nitrogen conversion were significantly improved. invasive species can be effectively treated with five g of biochar per kg of body weight. five out of six calves recovered from Lantana camara poisoning died. treatment with activated biochar achieved similarly high cure rates, but complete healing took about twice as long. results of feeding trials were sometimes neutral (no significant difference between biochar and control treatment), often one or several of the following effects were observed when biochar was provided as feeding additive to livestock. Poultry 0.2% of DM feed Wood No 17 49 Kana et al. (2010) Poultry 0.2% of feed DM Citrus wood No 0 42 Heavier abdomen fat Bakr (2007) Poultry 2.5%, 5%, 10% of feed DM Wood No 0 42 Weight increase up to 28 days but not after 49 days Kutlu, \u00dcnsal & G\u00f6rg\u00fcl\u00fc (2001) Flounder 1.5% of DM feed Wood No 20% wood vinegar 11 56 Highest feed efficiency increase of 10% at 0.5% BC Yoo, Ji & Jeong (2007) Stripfish 1% of DM feed Rice husk >600 No 36 90 Significantly improved water quality Lan, Preston & Leng (2018) Carp 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 4% of DM feed Bamboo No n.s. for 98 days, leng, Preston & Inthapanya fed four cattle 0.6% of a rice hull-derived biochar, with another four in a control group without biochar in their feed. biochar feeding resulted in a 25% higher weight gain compared to the control animals. a rice wine distillers\u2019 byproduct was added at 4% to the biochar-supplemented feed. the live weight gain and the feed conversion rate increased by 60% compared to the control without biochar supplement. the combination of biochar and other feed additives should increasingly be investigated. from 2011 to 2015, soil organic matter, pH (CaCl2), Colwell-P, Colwell-K, electrical conductivity and the content of all exchangeable cations increased in the pasture soil that received the dung of the free ranging cattle. most of these captured plant nutrients (especially nitrogen and phosphorus) remain bound in the porous structure of the biochar until its incorporation into the soil. lower levels of acetic acid and especially butyric acid are expected to minimize the risk of Clostridia infestation. the high-water holding capacity of biochar appears to buffer the water content of the silage, reducing the formation of excess fermentation liquids. a goat feed additive of 1.5% and 3% activated coconut biochar did not produce significant improvement of feed intake. however, the activated biochar increased the fecal concentration of slowly decomposable carbohydrates while reducing fecal N. this left the authors to surmise a beneficial slow-down in the mineralization rate of the organic carbon contained in the manure when applied to soil. the 0.3% biochar supplement corresponded to a significant feed efficiency increase of 17.5%. the biochar group showed significant positive effects on total protein, albumin, cholesterol, HDL-CH and LDL-cholesterol levels. the cortisol content was significantly lower, which indicates a reduced susceptibility to stress. piglets were fed with increasing concentrations of a 4:1 mixture of a low temperature biochar (HTT 450\u00b0) and wood vinegar. no statistically significant effects on body weight were observed compared to the 0% control. study systematically fed two different biochars to broiler chickens at different feeding concentrations from 0% to 1% per kg feed. ash levels of 47% and 25% indicate that a substantial portion of the initial biomass was burned and not fully pyrolyzed. however, feeding both biochars up to 0.6% led to greater, mostly significant weight gain, while the higher dosages led to no further significant weight gain. at 2%, significant increases on body weight, feed intake and feed efficiency were measured during the first three weeks compared to control. even the very high dose of 8% of a biochar of at least doubtful quality did not cause any adverse effects. Islam et al. (2014) showed in an experiment with 150 young ducks that feeding with 1% of a 1:1 mixture of biochar and sea tangle can be recommended as an alternative to the use of antibiotics in the feeding of ducks. it was for example found that no significant weight gain was recorded when fed with 0.5% activated coconut shell biochar. t & Takenoyama (2010) found an increase in egg production of nearly 5% when hens were fed with a blend of bamboo biochar and wood vinegar. the collagen content of the eggs increased significantly by 33% with a 1% feed of the same bamboo biochar\u2014wood vinegar mixture. two groups of 400 broilers were fed for 36 days with a 0.7% biochar supplement. the biochar treatment did not reveal any significant difference in daily weight gain, feed consumption, feed conversion rate or food pat and hook lesions compared to the two control groups that received the same feed without the biochar containing supplement. supplementing biochar at 2% increased the feed conversion ratio by 7%. at 4% biochar supplementation the life weight gain decreased by 8% compared to the control. no other investigated parameter showed significant differences to the control over the 21-day experimental period. the lower recovery of N in excreta is indicative of a more efficient digestive extraction of N. the inclusion of 2% and 4% biochar maintained egg production at normal levels when birds were challenged with fungal-contaminated feed. the control treatment led to decreased egg production by 16%. Japanese flounder were fed with 0\u20134% incremental doses of a bamboo biochar mixed into the regular feed. all biochar feeding rates resulted in significantly lower nitrogen excretions and reduced the nitrate content in the fish water by >50%. biochar treatments did not produce any obvious effect on growth performance of carps compared to 0% control. significant improvements were reported on serum indicators such as alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total protein, triglycerides, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) and glucose. the most beneficial effects were found at the highest biochar dosage. methane is a 28\u201334 times more harmful than CO2 (global warming potential with and without climate-carbon feedbacks over a period of 100 years) there is an increasing interest in feed supplements that increase feed efficiency, but also reduce methane emissions. urea was replaced with nitrate (6% of DM feed intake as KNO3 to supply the same amount of N) methane production decreased by up to 49%. biochar acts as a redox-active electron mediator that takes up electrons from microbial oxidation reactions. the proportion of NC10 in total bacteria in the rumen fluid was 10%. it could clearly be seen that NC10 mediated nitrate reduction led to reduced enteric methane emissions. methane formation in cattle could be reduced by 20%. the biochar in this and the earlier in vitro trial was produced at high temperatures (HTT = 900 \u00b0C) from silicon-rich rice husks. this suggests a high electrical conductivity and electron buffering capacity. a likely reason for this are differences in electrical conductivity and in electron buffering. winders et al. did not detect any significant reductions on methane emissions in steers over a 23 h period. four biochars were co-fermented at rates of 0.5%, 1%, 2% and 5% in ryegrass silage. none of the biochar treatments revealed any effect on methane production as compared to the control. in vitro rice husk 900 No 2% urea 10% Leng, Inthapanya & Preston (2012) 1% to ruminal liquid In vitro Rice husk 900 No 2% urea 12.7% Leng, Inthapanya & Preston (2012) 1% to ruminal liquid In vitro Rice husk 900 No 6% KNO3 49% Leng, Preston & Inthapanya (2013) 0.6% of feed DM In vivo Rice hus methane production was reduced by all biochar treatments and at both concentrations levels by about 5% compared to the control without biochar. a new perspective on the subject was recently put forth by Saleem et al. methane production reduced by 34%, 16% and 22%, respectively. all other biochars in all of the experiments reviewed here were alkaline (pH between 8 and 11.5) the acidification of biochar modifies the redox behavior and thus its \u201caffinity\u201d for microbial interaction. long-term biochar feeding trials with activated carbon seem to indicate low risks. administration of 20\u201350 g activated biochar daily in uremia patients for 4\u201320 months did not produce significant side effects. only a few scattered studies have addressed both points. our review suggests that the impact of biochar on microorganisms depends on the cell envelope. gram-negative bacteria (plasma membrane plus 20\u201380 nm peptidoglycan plus outer membrane) are better sorbed to biochar. the potentially selective action of biochars on various bacterial genera opens up the possibility of inoculating the biochar as a carrier matrix with beneficial bacteria. Fujita et al. (2012) conducted a comprehensive study in 2011. they examined the influence of biochar feeding on hens\u2019 health and egg quality. they showed no changes in the digestive tract or in the liver. biochar may also be added to animal drinking water. in case of acute intoxication, activated biochar should be administered in aqueous suspension. some german and Swiss farmers inject 1% (vol) of biochar into silage towers. highly activated biochar did not reduce the toxic effects of aflatoxin in chickens more strongly than non-activated biochar. therefore, the activation of biochar may not significantly increase the specific adsorption capacity for certain target substances or organisms. biochar activation and acidification can greatly modify the electron (and proton) mediating capacity. there is no scientific basis to prefer one source of biomass over another to produce feed-grade biochar. biochar from woody as well as non-woody precursors may safely be used for co-feeding purposes. the European Biochar Certificate (EBC) has been controlling and certifying the quality of biochar for use in animal feed since January 2016. the charcoal was administered pure; for others it was mixed with butter (cows), with eggs (dogs) or with meat (cats) it is likely that some of the substances are not good for hogs, but there is no doubt that some of the substances are not good for hogs. research into activated biochar has revealed its effect in reducing and adsorbing pathogenic clostridial toxins from Clostridium tetani and Clostridium botulinum. biochar products are used since at least 1880 in US-American hog breading and since 1940 in feed for poultry. colobus monkeys consumed 0.25\u20132.5 g of charcoal per kg body weight daily. a population count of colobus monkeys on this africa island showed that they reached the highest population density of all monkey species worldwide. the daily consumption of such wood-based biochar has no negative long-term effect at least not on these monkeys. the use of activated biochar feed for animal health was already being researched and recommended by german veterinarians at the beginning of the last century. the use of activated and non-activated biochar feed for animal health was already being researched and recommended by german veterinarians at the beginning of the last century. biochar products are used since at least 1880 in hog breading and since 1940 in feed for poultry. in nature, charcoal residues from wild fires can still be found years later. individual colobus monkeys consumed 0.25\u20132.5 g of charcoal per kg body weight daily. adsorption tests performed by Cooney & Struhsaker (1997) indicated that the african kiln charcoals were surprisingly good at adsorbing hot-water-extracted organics from the above-mentioned tree leaves. a population count of colobus monkeys on this africa island showed that they reached the highest population density of all monkey species worldwide. selective adsorption of some toxins like dioxins, co-adsorption of toxin containing feed substances, adsorption followed by a chemical reaction that destroys the toxin and desorption of earlier adsorbed substances in later stages of digestion. the selective colonization of biochar with gram-negative bacteria might result in decreased endotoxin release as these toxins could be adsorbed by the colonized biochar. biochar can take up compounds that diffuse along a concentration gradient between intestinal blood and primary urine. adsorption alone cannot explain all phenomena that are observed in biochar feeding experiments. biochars act as geobatteries that can accept, store and mediate electrons. the electrical conductivity of biochar is, however, not based on continuous electron flow, like in a copper wire, but on discontinuous electron hopping. this is of essential importance for biochar\u2019s function as a (microbial) electron mediator or so-called electron shuttle, facilitating even inter-species electron transfer. a well-balanced animal feed regime should contain multiple electron mediating substances. biochar can act as both a sole electron mediator or synergistic electron mediator. biochar can act as both a sole electron mediator or a synergistic electron mediator that increases the efficiency of other mediators. biochar acts here like a \u201cbattery\u201d (or electron buffer) that can be charged and discharged. biochar can be temporarily oxidized or reduced by microbes. it can buffer situations with a lack of electron donors or terminal electron acceptors. biochar has the function of a redox wheel in the digestive tract, comparable to FeIII\u2013FeII-redox wheels. it could act as an electron acceptor and donator coupling directly various biotic and abiotic redox-reactions. biochar contain, depending on the production process, a multitude of volatile organic carbons (VOC) biochar adsorbs certain feed and metabolic substances like tannins, phenols or thionin. biochar provides a highly porous framework with high specific surface area. humic-like substances or pyrolytic vinegar can be adsorbed and unfurl three-dimensionally as coating of the inner-porous aromatic carbon surfaces of biochar. biochar used as feed additive has a direct electro-chemical influence on digestive reactions. the higher the temperature above 600 \u00b0C, the better is electron transfer rate and electrical conductivity. the higher the VOC content of lower-temperature biochars, the more important the mediated electron transfer onto/from the biochar may become. biochar has been and still is used because of its high adsorption capacity for a variety of different toxins like mycotoxins, plant toxins, pesticides and pathogens. most of the effects of biochar are based on one or several of the following mechanisms: selective adsorption of some toxins like dioxins, co-adsorption of toxin containing feed substances. the selective colonization of biochar with gram-negative bacteria might result in decreased endotoxin release. one further major advantage of the use of biochar is its \u201centeral dialysis\u201d property. biochar can interrupt the so-called enterohepatic circulation of toxic substances between the intestine, liver and bile. low temperature biochars (HTT of 400\u2013450 \u00b0C) function as geobatteries mainly due to their phenol and quinone surface groups. high temperature biochars (HTT >600\u00b0), on the other hand, are good electrical conductors. biochar can accept and donate electrons as in microbial fuel cells. electrons do not exist in a free state under ambient environmental conditions. organisms always depend on the availability of both an electron donor and an acceptor to which surcharge electrons can be transferred. the coupling of electron donating and electron accepting reactions can, however, be bridged by so-called electron mediators or electron shuttles. biochar, specifically, can act as both a sole electron mediator or synergistic electron mediator that increases the efficiency of other mediators. microbial redox reactions can be optimized by electron shuttles, such as humic acids or activated biochar. biochar can be temporarily oxidized or reduced by microbes. it can buffer situations with a lack of electron donors or terminal electron acceptors. a principal aim of feeding biochar to animals could thus be to overcome metabolic redox limitations by enhancing electron exchange between microbes. some of the pyrolytic VOCs are strong electron acceptors and may act, like a redox wheel similar to how quinone works. some of these pyrolytic VOCs are so-called redox-active moieties (RAMs) that have been shown to contribute to the biodegradation of certain contaminants. biochar provides a highly porous framework with high specific surface area. humic-like substances or pyrolytic vinegar can be adsorbed and unfurl three-dimensionally as a coating of the inner-porous aromatic carbon surfaces. biochar particles may thus provide selective hotspots of microbial activity. electrical conductivity, redox potential, electron buffering and electron transfer capacity depend highly on the type of pyrolyzed feedstock, pyrolytic conditions. the higher the temperature above 600 \u00b0C, the better is the electron transfer rate and electrical conductivity (Sun et al., 2017). however, the higher the VOC content of, for example, lower-temperature biochars and higher abundance of surface functional groups on lower temperature biochars (400\u2013600 \u00b0C), the more adsorbents are usually added to the feed to bind the mycotoxins before ingestion. aflatoxin reduces the uptake of the toxin in the digestive tract and hence in the animal blood and in milk. galvano et al. (1996a) also investigated the adsorption capacity of 19 different activated carbons for two mycotoxins, ochratoxin A and deoxynivalenol. the activated biochar adsorbed 0.80\u201399.86% of the ochratoxin A and up to 98.93% of the deoxynivalenol. zearalenone, a dangerous estrogenic metabolite of the fungus species Fusarium, can be bound at each of the four biochar doses. in vitro, all zearalenone could be bound at each of the four biochar doses. but in vivo, hardly any specific adsorption could be achieved. d biochar was significantly higher than that of bentonite (65.2%) both adsorbents did not affect the composition of goat\u2019s milk nor the average level of milk production. in vitro studies with porcine digestive fluids showed high rates of adsorption of Fusarium toxins. activated biochar reduced the concentration of aflatoxin B in the feces of chickens for fattening, but only if the biochar was administered separately from the feed. the importance of dosage was confirmed in another recent poultry trial where 0.25% or 0.5% activated biochar was added to an aflatoxin B1 contaminated diet. negative effects of certain mycotoxins such as deoxynivalenol and zearalenone can be effectively suppressed with rather low dosages of activated biochar amended to feed. no benefit was found for aflatoxin. most studies have in common that only commercial activated carbons and biochars were used without proper characterization. the co-feeding of charcoal to juvenile animals appears as an appropriate prevention. a daily supplement of 400 g of a high-temperature wood-based biochar significantly reduced the concentration of antibodies against the Botox-producing pathogen Clostridium botulinum in the blood of cattle. biochar has a particularly strong adsorption or suppression capacity for gram-negative bacteria (e.g., E. coli) with high metabolic activity. the time between infection with the pathogen and administration of the biochar was too long. chicken manure biochar prepared at 350 \u00b0C did not improve the binding of either bacteria, but the addition of biochar prepared at 700 \u00b0C from pinewood or from chicken manure significantly reduced the spread of both bacteria. the latter may turn out to be an important insight into biochar\u2014bacterial interaction and needs to be investigated systematically. in vitro studies revealed that biochar can efficiently immobilize cattle rotavirus and coronaviruses at rates of 79\u201399.99%. the number of oocysts in the feces dropped significantly after a single day of feeding biochar. in acute poisoning, 50\u2013100 g of activated carbon or biochar are administered to adults and about one g/kg of body weight to children. the adsorbing effect of activated carbon can be used to prevent the gastrointestinal uptake of most drugs. the pharmaceutical products were co-applied to the activated carbon amended feed. biochar is considered as animal feed additive. of particular importance is the adsorption of glyphosate, an herbicide. daily feeding with humic acids (120 g/day) or 200 g of biochar and 500 g of sauerkraut juice significantly reduced the glyphosate concentration in the urine of cows fed with glyphosate contaminated silage. preliminary pesticide adsorption studies using biochar were already carried out in the 1970s. contaminated feed was mixed with activated biochar at 900 g per animal and day. dieldrin intake was reduced by 43% and DDT intake by 24%. Activated biochar also showed good in vitro adsorption properties. non-ortho PCBs, mono-ortho PCBs and mono-ortho PCBs could be reduced by more than 90%, 80% and 50% respectively. the fact that different organochlorine compounds are bound to different degrees by biochar has been previously demonstrated in studies of contaminated fish oil. char feed added 150 g of the same biochar per kg diet did not show any improvement compared to control. the mixture of 10\u201325 g of activated biochar per day with rye significantly increased the uptake of tannin and terpene rich compounds. treatment with bentonite achieved similar cure rates, but complete healing took about twice as long. significant results are found for treating yellow tulip poisoning of cattle and oleander poisoning of sheep. contamination of animal feed with mycotoxins is a worldwide problem that affects 25% of the world\u2019s feed production. diaz et al. (2002) showed in vitro sorption batch study that four different activated carbons adsorbed 99% of the aflatoxin B from a 0.5% aflatoxin B-spiked solution. in vivo test, an insufficiently characterized (activated) biochar was fed at a low concentration of 0.25% of the feed fresh weight, whereas in in vitro studies, the biochar was added at 1% to the aqueous solution. adsorbent feed additives for dairy cows to reduce aflatoxin content in milk. cows fed activated biochar and the contaminated silage had higher feed intake and improved digestibility of neutral detergent fiber, hemicellulose and crude protein. authors showed cows preferred good quality silage to contaminated silage either with or without biochar. they concluded farmers should focus on providing high quality feed rather than mitigating negative effects of contaminated silage with biochar. 0.25% or 0.5% activated biochar was added to an aflatoxin B1 contaminated diet, decreasing aflatoxin B1 residues in the liver of the birds by 16\u201372%. alumina product resulted in considerable liver and blood levels of aflatoxin B when administered at 0, 40, 80 g AFB1 per kg diet. the results of most studies on sorption in aqueous solution did not correlate with the results in corresponding in vivo test results. in vitro studies have to be interpreted with care, because matrix effects can dramatically impact mycotoxin sorption. in 1914, the adsorbing effect of charcoal for various toxins in the digestive tract was described by Skutetzky & Starkenstein (1914) first experiments with bacterial toxins of Clostridium tetani and Clostridium botulinum as well as with diphtheria toxin were performed as early as 1919. the in vivo test by Knutson et al. with the same activated biochar (DARCO-KB; Norit\u00ae) revealed no biochar binding of either E. coli or S. typhimurium in the gastrointestinal tract of sheep. the authors hypothesize that either the binding sites were occupied by competing substances or other digestive bacteria. all biochars produced by either fast or slow pyrolysis from switchgrass, horse manure or hardwood significantly reduced EHEC concentrations. chicken manure biochar prepared at 350 \u00b0C did not improve binding of either bacteria, but the addition of biochar prepared at 700 \u00b0C from pinewood or from chicken manure significantly reduced the spread of both bacteria. bamboo biochar feed supplement suppressed fecal excretion of gram-negative coliform bacteria and gram-negative Salmonella in pigs. the effect of biochar on the suppression of both bacterial species was of the same order of magnitude as that of antibiotics. biochar can efficiently immobilize cattle rotavirus and coronaviruses at rates of 79\u201399.99%. ocysts could be found in the feces of the calves. similar results were reported when a commercial biochar wood acetic acid product was tested as feed additive in young goats. the mixture administered twice or thrice daily reduced the clinical signs of diarrhea already on the first day. Finnish physicians recommend repeated oral treatment with activated carbon to reduce the risk of toxins being desorbed from the biochar-toxin complex in the digestive cycle. however, regular administration of 0.2% activated biochar in broiler feed did not significantly impact the blood levels of antimicrobial drugs doxycycline and tylosin. glyphosate sorption efficiency onto biochar particles is both dependent on pH (high sorption at low pH; Herath et al., 2016) and the highest treatment temperature during biochar production. however, Hall et al. (2018) showed that glyphosate sorbed by biochar from pure water could be remobilized by adding 0.1M monopotassium phosphate solution. pesticides in the digestive tracts of cattle, sheep and goats were excreted. animals were fed one kg of activated biochar per day for 14 days. dieldrin and DDT-contaminated feed was mixed with activated biochar. Fujita et al. (2012) carried out an extensive experiment with 24 laying hens. they fed either with or without 0.5% biochar over a period of 30 weeks. the fact that different organochlorine compounds are bound to different degrees by biochar has been previously demonstrated in studies of contaminated fish oil. nins are often found in high protein feeds such as legumes. the strong taste repels the animals, which reduces digestability and weight gain. in goats, feeding 50\u2013100 g of bamboo biochar per kg. 0.5\u20131.5 g of biochar per lamb per day mixed directly to the feed. lambs rejected the bitterweed-containing feed without biochar. but they did consume bitterweed up to 26.4% of the total feed intake. studies show poisoning of both livestock and sheep can be effectively treated with five g of biochar per kg of body weight. the review of 27 peer reviewed scientific publications and clinical studies about regular biochar feeding revealed no negative effects on animal welfare and performance. there are open question on some effects on long-term biochar feeding that should be addressed before an unconfined recommendation of regular biochar feeding.

Japanese flounder were fed with 0\u20134% incremental doses of a bamboo biochar mixed into the regular feed (Thu et al., 2010). both biochars led to 25% increased ratio of weight to length. water quality improved significantly as levels of ammonia nitrogen, nitrite, phosphate and chemical oxygen demand decreased by 24%, 22%, 15%, 21%. biochar may facilitate the formation of biofilms as habitat for gut microbiota. the somatic cell count (SCC) of the milk decreased significantly. milk protein and milk fat content increased when biochar additions to feed stopped. postpartum health was stabilized through biochar co-feeding. a high temperature biochar (HTT 600 \u00b0C) was added at 0%, 0.5%, 1% and 2% to a high-forage diet for 17 days. the biochar linearly increased the digestion of dry matter, organic matter, crude protein and fiber. microbial protein synthesis also increased linearly. biochar captures organic and mineral compounds with high plant fertilizing properties that would otherwise be subject to rather quick leaching during storage. most of these captured plant nutrients remain bound in the porous structure of the biochar until its incorporation into the soil, where they likely become, to a large extent, plant available as has also been found for biochar after aerobic composting. the high-water holding capacity of biochar appears to buffer the water content of the silage, reducing the formation of excess fermentation liquids. the biochar treatments did not significantly affect the investigated silage quality parameters, nor did it negatively affect in vitro incubation with rumen fluid. the activated biochar increased the fecal concentration of slowly decomposable carbohydrates while reducing fecal N. this left the authors to surmise a beneficial slow-down in the mineralization rate of the organic carbon contained in the manure when applied to soil. pigs Chu et al. published several fundamental studies on the feeding of bamboo biochar to pigs. the biochar group showed significant positive effects on total protein, albumin, cholesterol, HDL-CH and LDL-cholesterol levels in the blood plasma. the cortisol content was significantly lower, which indicates a reduced susceptibility to stress. the authors examined to what extent biochar feeding can replace the regular supplementation of growth-promoting antibiotics. weight and feed efficiency were observed compared to the 0% control. however, duodenal villi height, an animal health indicator, increased significantly. biochar treatments prevented negative side-effects of pig fattening with protein-rich pigeon peas. ash levels indicate that a substantial portion of the initial biomass was burned and not fully pyrolyzed. however, feeding both biochars up to 0.6% led to greater, mostly significant weight gain, while the higher dosages led to no further significant weight gain, but also to no weight loss compared to the control. a polish working group led by Teresa Majewska conducted several feed trials on chickens and turkeys between 2000 and 2012. they achieved consistently positive results with doses of 0.3% of a hardwood biochar. they found higher weight gain and better feed efficiency, but also higher protein levels in the pectoral muscles. research groups have shown that the quality of chickens\u2019 meat can be significantly improved by feeding of biochar. it was for example found that no significant weight gain was recorded when fed with 0.5% activated coconut shell biochar. biochar, bentonite and zeolite for selective pathogen control in hens. their treatments involved the commercial layer diet (control group) amended with biochar, bentonite and zeolite at 4% w/w. the total egg weight increased by 5% and the feed conversion ratio increased by 12% compared to the control. the biochar treatment did not reveal any significant difference in daily weight gain, feed consumption, feed conversion rate or food pat and hook lesions compared to the control groups that received the same feed without the biochar containing supplement. the results of Kupper et al. (2015) are in puzzling contradiction with similar trial in same country undertaken at the Swiss Aviforum. at 4% biochar supplementation the life weight gain decreased by 8% both compared to the control. no other investigated parameter showed significant differences to the control. the feeding of such pyrolyzed material is in several regards not in agreement with the EBC-feed standard. NH3-emissions of the poultry manure increased by 31% in the treatment with 2% and 4% but not with 1% biochar feed amendments compared to the control. biochar supplements have been fed to fish with the intention to improve water quality as well as fish health and productivity. biochar feed additions resulted in significantly higher flounder weight gains. all biochar feeding rates resulted in significantly lower nitrogen excretions and reduced the nitrate content in the fish water by >50%. the most beneficial effects were found at the highest biochar dosage. no adverse effects were observed. ruminant production accounts for about 81% of total GHG from the livestock sector. methane is 28\u201334 times more harmful than CO2 (global warming potential with and without climate-carbon feedbacks over a period of 100 years; Myrhe et al., 2013) there is an increasing interest in feed supplements that not only increase feed efficiency, but also can reduce methane emissions resulting from ruminant digestion. methane reductions by nitrate (29%) and biochar (22%) were higher when fed combined (49%). biochar acts as a redox-active electron mediator that takes up electrons from microbial oxidation reactions (e.g., oxidation of acetate to CO2) and donates the electron at a certain distance from the microbial reaction center (at another spot of the same biochar particle) NC10 DAMO bacteria were found in wetlands and grassland soils. the proportion of NC10 in total bacteria in the rumen fluid was 10%. it could clearly be seen that NC10 mediated nitrate reduction led to reduced enteric methane emissions. rumen fluid from cows fed biochar produced less methane than rumen fluid from non-biochar-fed cattle. this suggests the animals fed biochar may have had a different microbial community in the rumen. four biochars were co-fermented at 0.5%, 1%, 2% and 5% in ryegrass silage. none of the treatments revealed any effect on methane production as compared to the control. it is impossible yet to identify a convincing reason or mechanism to explain the strong divergence. Activation Blend CH4-reduction Source 0.5% to ruminal liquid In vitro Rice husk 900 No 2% urea 10% Leng, Inthapanya & Preston (2012) 1% to ruminal liquid In vitro Rice husk 900 No 6% KNO3 49% Leng, Inthapanya & Preston (2012) 0.6% of feed DM In vivo Rice husk 900 No 6% KNO3 40% Leng, Preston & Inthap methane production was reduced by all biochar treatments and at both concentrations levels by about 5% compared to the control without biochar. the absence of significant differences between those very different biochars is puzzling though an important milestone towards the understanding of biochar\u2019s mechanisms in animal digestions. the first and only experiment to demonstrate a reduction of methane emissions using acidified biochar. the promising results of leng, Inthapanya & Preston (2012) call for systematic investigations of pyrolytic and post pyrolytic treatments. none of the activated and non-activated biochars used as feed additive or veterinary treatment had toxic or negative effects on animals. the administration of 20\u201350 g activated biochar daily in uremia patients for 4\u201320 months did not produce significant side effects. the main risks of long-term biochar feeding may arise (1) from shifting microbial species composition. peptidoglycan (plasma membrane plus 10 nm peptidoglycan plus outer membrane) are better sorbed to biochar. however, the structure of the cell envelope and the fact of being gram-positive or negative does not, on its own, indicate whether a bacteria is a pathogen. vitamin E content in the eggs was reduced by about 40% when hens were fed daily with 0.5% biochar. it was the first evidence that a beneficial compound like a vitamin can be significantly reduced by co-feeding biochar. however, risk of quality-controlled biochar feed can be considered low. some german and Swiss farmers inject 1% (vol) of biochar into silage towers or silage bales via automated equipment. biochar was not administered alone, but in admixture with other functional feed supplements such as humic acid, wood vinegar, sauerkraut juice and eubiotic liquids. highly activated biochar did not reduce the toxic effects of aflatoxin in chickens more strongly than non-activated biochar. downstream activation is not necessary and can be achieved merely by adjusting the pyrolysis parameters. however, to date no systematic research has been done with such modified biochars in animal feeding. there is no scientific basis to prefer one source of biomass over another to produce feed-grade biochar. biochar from woody as well as non-woody precursors may safely be used for co-feeding purposes. the European Biochar Certificate (EBC) has been controlling and certifying the quality of biochar for use in animal feed since January 2016. the characterization of the biochar itself was insufficiently analyzed. the electrochemical interaction of biochar and organic systems is extremely complex. the combination with other feed additives and inoculants may be mandatory to achieve the full functionality of biochar."}
