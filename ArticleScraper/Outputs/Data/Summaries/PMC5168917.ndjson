{"summary": "records of patients with simple (dystrophic) congenital ptosis who were followed for 6 months postoperatively were evaluated in the study. success was defined as a MRD at the last postoperative visit of 3 mm. levator resection was performed on patients with LF >4 mm technique and frontalis suspension was performed on patients with LF 4 mm. patients with unsatisfactory outcomes were excluded from the study. classification according to LF was evaluated as predicted/hypothesized class. inappropriate surgery selection, if results of MRD1 and LF were compatible, they were classified as true positive or true negative. selection of frontalis suspension was accepted as negative classifier. patients whose initial MRD1 was 0.5 mm fared better when frontalis suspension was used. patients whose initial MRD1 was 0.5 mm fared better when levator resection was used. at the cutoff MRD1 of 0.5 mm, the sensitivity was 71%. method generates a set of thresholds to sample, then for each threshold it finds the corresponding point of each ROC curve (dashed line) the optimum cutoff point at which the highest sensitivity and specificity for selection of appropriate surgical technique was determined as 0.5 mm for MRD1. Sensitivity represents the true positive rate, and 1-specificity represents the false positive rate. MRD1 is a commonly used parameter in the assessment of patients with blepharoptosis. it is defined as the distance between the upper lid margin and the corneal reflex when the eye is in the primary position. in severe cases, values of zero or less may be present. the results of our study suggest that MRD1 may be used as a secondary parameter to determine the surgical approach in patients with congenital blepharoptosis. the major limitation of this study is its retrospective nature. financial support and sponsorship Nil.
