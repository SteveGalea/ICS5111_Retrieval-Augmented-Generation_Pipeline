{"summary": "influenza is one of the most important pathogens due to their seasonality and continued pandemic threat. influenza is one of the most important pathogens due to their seasonality and continued pandemic threat. the infection by the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) causes a progressive loss of CD4+ T cells through virus-, cellular- and immune activation-dependent mechanisms [15], eventually collapsing the immune system. the fate of HIV-1 infection and replication in the respiratory tract remains poorly understood [22], [22]. in this study, we show that influenza replication is attenuated during HIV-1/A(H1N1)pdm09 co-infection experimental assays. we report that HIV-1 interferes with the A(H1N1)pdm09 replicative cycle, arresting the influenza evolution and attenuating the viral replication. this may explain the mild influenza infection observed in patients co-infected with both viruses. all data from HIV-1/A(H1N1)pdm09 co-infected individuals were analysed in an anonymous fashion. cells and Viruses Human epithelial cervical cancer (HeLa) and Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells were cultured with Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM; LGC Biotecnologia, So Paulo, Brazil) macrophages were prepared in 25-cm2 plastic bottles from 4.0107 PBMCs previously seeded in 5 mL of medium per bottle. the virus was expanded in MDCK cells and the HIV-1 isolate was expanded in phytohemagglutinin-activated PBMCs. the viability of HeLa cells was 95% under the conditions described above. A(H1N1)pdm09 co-infections Macrophages were infected with HIV-1 by exposing them overnight to viral suspensions containing 10 ng/mL of p24 antigen (p24 Ag) non-internalized viruses were then removed by washing, and cell monolayers were replenished with fresh medium. HIV-1 and Influenza quantifications were evaluated in cell-culture supernatants by a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. reagents for real time RT-PCR, including primers, probes and enzymes, were used as recommended by WHO [36]. the retrotranscription mRNA and total influenza RNA were measured in influenza-infected macrophages treated with ribavirin. western blotting immunoblotting assays were performed to quantify IFITM3 contents in HeLa cells and macrophages exposed to HIV-1 (10 ng/mL of p24 Ag), rHIV-1gp120 (5 g/mL) and kept at standard culture conditions during different periods of time. 6.0104 cells were transfected with siRNA for IFITM3 (Life Technologies) or its scramble sequence at a concentration of 0.4 nM in OPTI-MEM. cells were washed and infected with A(H1N1)pdm09 (MOI = 1) for 1h. cells were exposed to HIV-1 overnight. early and late lysates were centrifuged (10 min. at 1000 g), allowing the separation of nuclear (pellet) and non-nuclear fractions. lncRNA is exclusively expressed in the nuclear fraction, based on the literature [46] and our results. cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. after that, they were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton-X 100 for 10 min. patients and data collection Nasopharingeal aspirates or swabs from patients with confirmed diagnosis of A(H1N1)pdm09, co-infected or not by HIV-1, were collected from individuals attending the Brazilian influenza surveillance program. the collected NPAs were sent to the Brazilian National Influenza Center were the laboratory-based diagnosis were confirmed by real time RT-PCR assay [36]. the comparisons between means were considered significantly different when the P value was less than 0.05, by means of Student'st test. the research ethics committee approved the retrospective use of samples and clinical data from HIV-1/A(H1N1)pdm09 co-infected individuals. need for informed consent has been waived. cell infection assays were performed with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (A/Minas Gerais/490/2009-like strain) or with the monocytotropic, CCR5-dependent isolate HIV-1Ba-L (donated by the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program) mock was used as a control, in same proportions as the influenza-containing medium. viability of HeLa cells and macrophages was 95% under conditions described above. anti-TLR2 (aTLR2), anti-TLR4 (aTLR4), control isotype, soluble CD4 (sCD4) or the antiretroviral enfuvirtide (T20) were purchased from Invivogen. blockers of HIV-1 entry have been received by donation from NIH AIDS Reagent program. dm09-infected macrophages were lysed 24 h p.i. and RNA extracted with a commercial kit. oligo.dT- and UNI-12 primers allow preferentially the retrotranscription mRNA and total influenza RNA, respectively. blots were incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-IFITM3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or mouse polyclonal anti-actin antibody (Sigma) for 1 h. densitometry values were initially expressed as arbitrary units to calculate mean SEM. cells were washed and incubated with warm medium during 6 h at 37\u00b0C. after 24 h p.i., cells were lysed with buffer A. this last condition is enough to allow influenza RNPs to reach the cell nucleus. the lncRNA is exclusively expressed in the nuclear fraction, based on the literature [46] and our results. cross-contamination between RNA from non-nuclear fraction on the nuclear preparation is unlike to occur. cells were seeded onto Aclar plastic coverslipes for 3 h on 24-well plates previously coated with rat-tail collagen. specimens were mounted in glycerol with 5% n-propyl gallate, 0.25% DABCO (1,4\u2013diazabicyclo(2,2,2)octane) and 0.0025% para-phenylenediamine (all from Sigma) as a control, experiments were performed without antibodies to monitor any background signs. Statistical analysis The results of this study were prepared using Excel 2010 for Windows software (Microsoft), from at least three independent experiments. Means standard error of the means (SEM) are displayed. infectivity of influenza virus produced in the presence of HIV-1 and its gp120 was also reduced by approximately 2-log10. other HIV-1 proteins, which could be secreted from HIV-1-infected cells, such as Tat, did not affect influenza replication significantly. the agonism of TLR 2 and 4 in the respiratory tract may lead to an IFN-I-dependent response [12]. IFNs inhibit influenza replication in cell culture and in laboratory animals by the restriction factor IFITM3 [49] sCD4 prevented the HIV-1-dependent inhibition of influenza replication. only sCD4 could block gp120 interaction with virtually any receptor on the cell surface. T20 blocks gp41 translocation by preventing gp41 translocation. IFITM3 knocked down assays to confirm IFITM3 participation in the HIV-1-induced inhibition of influenza replication. cells transfected with siRNA for IFITM3 were infected with A(H1N1)pdm09, exposed to HIV-1 or culture medium, and 24 h after influenza infection. blotting assay for the proteins IFITM3 and -actin, as an housekeeping. panel A is representative of three independent experiments. macrophages were infected with influenza (MOI = 5) and the inoculum was not removed. at different times, the supernatant of the cultures were collected and the remaining amounts of A(H1N1)pdm09 measured. the infectivity of the original inoculum dropped substantially after 3 days p.i. virus-infected macrophages exposed to a(H1N1)pdm09 (MOI = 5) for 3 days. the amount and infectivity of influenza recovered from the supernatants were monitored. the results were consistently reproduced in macrophages from eight different healthy donors. the HIV-1 infection augmented by three times the macrophage IFITM3 levels (as detected 14 days after infection), relative to IFITM3 contents in uninfected cells. we tried to perform siRNA assays to knockdown IFITM3 in macrophages; knockdown efficiency varied severely from donor to donor. the increase of IFITM3 level in macrophages reduces A(H1N1)pdm09 penetration in in vitro co-infection. in parallel, macrophages infected by HIV-1 were infected by A(H1N1)pdm09 (MOI 5) for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 RNA levels in HIV-1- vs. mock-infected macrophages. to confirm these results, we compared the A(H1N1)pdm09 distribution in the nuclei of HIV-1-infected and uninfected macrophages. these cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with anti-influenza NP (red) and the DNA probe DAPI (blue). the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with anti-HIV-1 p24 (green), anti-influenza NP (red) and the DNA probe DAPI (blue). the ability of this orthomyxovirus to induce the production of pro-inflamatory cytokines, such as TNF-, would be impaired. the ability of this orthomyxovirus to induce the production of pro-inflamatory cytokines, such as TNF-, is reduced in HIV-1-infected macrophages. we analyzed the influenza genome from both co-infection experiments and patients. we sequenced the A(H1N1)pdm09 hemagglutinin (HA) gene that escaped from HIV-1-, gp120- and IFN--induced inhibition. the supernatant was harvested, RNA was extracted, the HA gene of influenza was sequenced and presumptive amino acid residues analyzed. trees are rooted by vaccinal strain A/California/07/2009. circles indicate samples from co-infected individuals. s existed to cluster A(H1N1)pdm09 sequences from HIV-1 co-infected individuals together. it is possible to observe that Brazilian strains have the changes P100S, I338V and Q310R. the reduced influenza evolution in the presence of HIV-1 may reflect a compromised A(H1N1)pdm09 replication. an approximately 40% and 25% decrease in the quantification of A(H1N1)pdm09 was observed when influenza-infected cells were exposed to HIV-1 or to gp120. infectivity of influenza virus produced in the presence of HIV-1 and its gp120 was also reduced by approximately 2-log10. the IFN- was used as positive control. the asterisks indicate statistical significance (P0.05) over control. sCD4 prevented the HIV-1-dependent inhibition of influenza replication, whereas T20 did not. gp120 is free to interact with TLR 2 and 4 under treatment with T20. the basal levels of IFITM3 protein is shown in HeLa cells exposed only to culture medium. we performed IFITM3 knocked down assays to confirm participation in the HIV-1-induced inhibition of influenza replication. cells were fected by A(H1N1)pdm09 (MOI 5) for 1 h after influenza infection. monolayers were lysed with Laemmli buffer and submitted to blotting assay for proteins IFITM3 and -actin, as an housekeeping. macrophages were infected with influenza (MOI = 5) and the inoculum was not removed. at different times, the supernatant of the cultures were collected and the remaining amounts of A(H1N1)pdm09 measured. XTT technique performed HIV-1/influenza co-infection assays in macrophages. in primary macrophages the HIV-1 replication peaks around 15 days. influenza infectivity inoculum remains constant for up to three days. supernatants of similar cultures were added to MDCK cultures to evaluate the influenza infectivity after 72 h [36] (n = 3). the HIV-1 infection augmented by three times the macrophage IFITM3 levels (as detected 14 days after infection), relative to IFITM3 contents in uninfected cells. increased levels of influenza RNA was detected in the non-nuclear fraction. increased levels of influenza RNA was concomitant with the low amount of influenza RNA found in the nuclear fraction. it is reasonable to imagine that in the presence of HIV-1, A(H1N1)pdm09 virus particles would enter into the macrophages. flu A(H1N1)pdm09 RNA levels in HIV-1- vs. mock-infected macrophages were compared. NP localizes superficially in most of the cells, while some already display this protein in their nuclei, at 1 h after infection. at 24 h after influenza infection, NP is observed in the nuclei of HIV-1-infected macrophages. macrophages were infected with influenza for 1 (A), 3 (B), 6 (C) and 24h (D) these cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with anti-HIV-1 p24 (green), anti-influenza NP (red) and the DNA probe DAPI (blue). ribavirin-treated and -untreated influenza-infected macrophages were submitted to the same procedure described above (inset) the ability of this orthomyxovirus to induce the production of pro-inflamatory cytokines, such as TNF-, would be impaired due to HIV-1-imposed early restriction on influenza life cycle. we analyzed the influenza genome from both co-infection experiments and patients. we sequenced the A(H1N1)pdm09 hemagglutinin (HA) gene that escaped from HIV-1-, gp120- and IFN--induced inhibition. the HA gene of influenza was sequenced and presumptive amino acid residues analyzed. trees are rooted by vaccinal strain A/California/07/2009. evolution of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses from HIV-1-infected individuals seems to have been impaired when compared to other samples from similar geographical region and time period. no specific pattern of mutations existed to cluster A(H1N1)pdm09 sequences from HIV-1 co-infected individuals together. comitant infection with HIV-1 may attenuate the replication of Influenza virus. we evaluated whether HIV-1 infection could interfere in influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 life cycle. this study represents a challenging approach because these agents primarily infect different cell types. antiretroviral resistance mutations may be found in the sputum of individuals with undetectable, HAART-suppressed, viremia [21], [22]. influenza infection triggers a pulmonary inflammatory response with subsequent homing of monocytes to the respiratory tract [5], [57], thus increasing the number of HIV-1 permissive cells. despite that, influenza-infected macrophages progeny is uninfectious. the IFITM3 effect on influenza life cycle could toll influenza replication. we also used human primary macrophages in our experimental studies. we also found that HIV-1 enhances IFITM3 content. fected macrophages may have reduced influenza-ability to induce TNF-. this is one of the most important cytokines released during influenza-induced cytokine storm. this could have contributed to the surprise mild clinical outcomes observed in 2009 pandemics. RNA from each of these fractions was extracted, cDNA synthetized and real time PCR performed. exposure to HIV-1 Tat has no effect on influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 replication. the cell lineages HeLa and TZM-bl were exposed to HIV-1 (10 ng/mL of HIV-1 p24 Ag) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. after that, cells were washed to remove unbounded viruses. at indicated days after infection, aliquots of the culture supernatants were collected.
