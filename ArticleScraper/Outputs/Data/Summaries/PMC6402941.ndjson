{"summary": "acute febrile illness (AFI) or fever without localizing signs is a common reason for hospitalization in tropical and subtropical settings. etiology varies widely by geographic region, season, and climate, and is challenging to identify based on clinical features alone. the contribution of respiratory viruses to global AFI burden is not well described in the literature. tertiary care hospital in the southern province of Sri Lanka from June 2012 to October 2014. patients 1 year of age with documented fever (> 38\u00b0C) at presentation or within 48 hours of hospital admission were eligible. details regarding patients\u2019 clinical management and outcomes during hospitalization were extracted from the medical record. monthly proportion being 10% during two consecutive years. if circulation varied from year to year then a peak was not identified according to the definition. the multivariable model was constructed by adding the variables with the highest posterior inclusion probabilities until an effect was no longer significant. all analyses were performed using STATA, version 11. (STATACorp, College Station, TX) written informed consent was obtained from all patients and from parents or guardians of minors. the Luminex platform detects 19 respiratory viruses (RSV A and B; nonspecific influenza A subtypes H1, H3, and 2009 H1N1; influenza B; parainfluenza 1\u20134; human metapneumovirus; HRV/HEV; coronavirus types NL63, HKU1, 229E, and OC43; and human bocavirus) Tachypnea was defined as > 40 breaths/minute for children aged 1 to 5 years. > 20 breaths/minute for children aged 5 years and adults. of 1,954 patients enrolled from June 2012 to October 2014, 968 patients had upper respiratory samples collected and tested. the median age was 26.2 years (IQR 14.6\u201339.9 years) and 135 patients (14.0%) were aged 5 years. most commonly detected pathogen was influenza for both adults and children. 0.98 Untypeable 7 (0.7) \u2013 7 (0.8) 0.29 Influenza B 46 (4.8) 7 (5.4) 39 (4.7) 0.73 Parainfluenza virus 13 (1.4) 11 (8.5) 2 (0.2) 0.001 Parainfluenza 1 3 (0.3) 2 (1.5) 1 (0.1) 0.007 Parainfluenza 2 2 (0.2) 2 (1.5) \u2013 0.001 Parainfluenza 3 8 (0.8) 7 (5.4) 1 (0.1) r = 0.42 (95% CI: 0.05\u20130.68, P = 0.03) for all respiratory viruses and r = 0.42 (95% CI: 0.05\u20130.68, P = 0.03) for influenza. rainfall (r = 0.24, 95% CI: 0.56 to 0.15, P = 0.22), minimum daily temperature (r = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.10 to 0.60, P = 0.14), daytime humidity (r = 0.11, 95% CI: 0. patients with respiratory virus identified were younger than patients with no respiratory virus (median age 9.8 versus 27.7 years, P 0.001) and were more likely to report a sick contact within the prior 4 weeks. clinical symptoms were different in patients with and without respiratory virus identified.
