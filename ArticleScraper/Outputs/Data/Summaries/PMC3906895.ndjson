{"summary": "the total daily posted and forwarded number for H7N9 on Sina microblog peaked at 850,000 on April 3, from zero blogs before March 31, increasing to 97,726 on April 1 and 370,607 on April 2, and remaining above 500,000 from April 5-8. the median daily posted and forwarded number and daily BAI during the studied 25 days was significantly higher among the 7 provinces/cities with reported human H7N9 cases than the 2 provinces without any cases. 32 confirmed rumors spread across 19 provinces/cities in china. 84% (27/32) of rumors were disseminated and transmitted by social media. internet surveillance can be used as an efficient and economical tool to prevent and control public health emergencies. in china, there are approximately 429 million users using search engine websites. in 2011, 77.2% Internet users preferred Baidu website as their first search engine. the power of Internet users in china is becoming stronger, especially in public opinion leadership. the study population was Internet users in china during the study period of Avian Influenza A H7N9 outbreaks. the first human case with H7N9 virus infection was reported by the china national health and family planning committee (CNHFPC) all cases were confirmed by DNA sequencing. daily BAI computes the weighted sum of searching frequency for a keyword based on its daily search volume on the Baidu website [13] daily BAI for the keyword H7N9 was collected from the BAI webpage from March 31 to April 24, 2013. daily BAI for the keyword H7N9 from the 7 provinces that reported human H7N9 cases were also collected during the study period. rumors of H7N9 outbreaks were qualitatively classified by date, province, rumor maker, media, and main content. our study population was Internet users in china during the study period of Avian Influenza A H7N9 outbreaks. daily posted and forwarded numbers in the 2 provinces without cases were used as a base/reference. the daily BAI computes the weighted sum of searching frequency for a keyword based on its daily search volume on the Baidu website. the government stopped daily case reports after April 24, 2013. all cases were confirmed by DNA sequencing. the daily posted and forwarded number can be used as an estimate for the degree of attention to an event. daily BAI data from Hubei and Shaanxi provinces in the Midwest of China were collected as a base/reference to compare the differences of public reactions with the provinces with H7N9 cases. rumors of H7N9 were officially verified and confirmed by the local authorities on the Baidu website. 108 cases and 23 deaths (cumulative case fatality rate = 21.3%) of H7N9 infections were reported in 7 provinces/cities in china. by April 12, 43 cases had been reported in 4 provinces in Eastern China and then the epidemic expanded to Beijing on April 13 and Henan province on April 14. median daily posted and forwarded number was 289,325 (range 76,482-853,027) daily posted and forwarded number positively associated with cumulative case fatality rate. higher cumulative case fatality rate higher daily posted and forwarded number at the early stage of epidemic and lower cumulative case fatality rate lower daily posted and forwarded number later. the mean rank value of the daily posted and forwarded number in each province/city with human H7N9 cases reported except Anhui was significantly higher (P.001) than that in the 2 provinces without cases reported. the observed median daily posted and forwarded number and Baidu Attention Index (BAI) for H7N9 by province/city from March 31 to April 24, 2013. the daily BAI increased again and peaked at 116,991 on April 15. the median daily BAI was 79,687 (range 18,007-79,687). the daily BAI was positively associated with cumulative case fatality rate. the mean rank values of daily BAI in the provinces with reported cases were significantly higher than that in the provinces without cases. in all, 84% (27/32) rumors were disseminated through Sina microblog, QQ, and Wechat. 16% (5/32) were spread via bulletin board system (BBS), cell phone message, and telephone calls. total of 32 confirmed rumors for H7N9 outbreaks classified by main content during the H7N9 outbreaks in China from March 31 to April 24, 2013. 108 cases and 23 deaths (cumulative case fatality rate = 21.3%) of H7N9 infections were reported in 7 provinces/cities in China. by April 12, 43 cases had been reported in 4 provinces in Eastern China. 368,500 on April 13 and 339,822 on April 14, declined to 262,667 on April 15 and 235,131 on April 16. the total daily posted and forwarded number then decreased and remained at a level of 100,000 (Figure 2). the median of the total daily posted and forwarded number was 289,325 (range 76,482-853,027) the mean rank value of the daily posted and forwarded number in each province/city with human H7N9 cases reported except Anhui was significantly higher (P.001) than that in the 2 provinces without cases. the observed median daily posted and forwarded number was significantly higher (P.001) than that in the 2 provinces without cases. daily BAI for keyword H7N9 increased sharply in the first 3 days of the H7N9 outbreak, with a peak at 126,825 on April 3. after the cases reported in Beijing and Henan, the daily BAI peaked at 116,991 on April 15. median daily BAI was 4227 (range 0-9014) in Shanghai, 1723 (0-2765) in Anhui, 6592 (0-11,914) in Jiangsu, 6432 (0-15,011) in Zhejiang, 4790 (0-9488) in Beijing, 2731 (0-7592) in Henan, 3065 (0-6763) in Shandong, 1420

for H7N9 outbreaks classified by main content during the H7N9 outbreaks in China. network monitoring can be timelier to know public reactions to the outbreak because it is a real-time surveillance during the emergencies and also it is very economical without consuming too many resources [6,7,13,16,24,25]. emerging infectious diseases usually have the features of unknown pathogens and high mortality, no vaccine or effective treatment available, and quick and wide dissemination. the public attention decreased with a decrease in case fatality rate. this indicates that the public attention decreases when the threat from the epidemic disease decreases. the daily posted and forwarded number increased significantly. the first 3 days could be a \u201cgolden 3 days\u201d for the government and public health authorities to release information in time and make the information transparent and open. the high public attention would last for a week; thus, this week could be a critical period for health education. internet surveillance can be used as an efficient and economical tool to control and prevent public health emergencies, such as the H7N9 avian influenza outbreak. it is important for risk communicators in the government to clearly know the public concern [18] when an emerging infectious disease outbreak occurs, it is important to know the public concern. the high attention to this outbreak lasted 3 - 5 days, which is a good time for the department of emergency control and prevention to disseminate health education knowledge and skills through network and social media. some studies have shown that the public concern with the H1N1 influenza infection was associated with the number of reported cases and hospitalizations by the governments [22,23]. however, other studies reported that although the number of flu cases rose, the tweets about the H1N1 influenza showed a downward trend [16 the daily posted and forwarded number and BAI were collected from the internet and could not be standardized because of lack of exact numbers of daily Internet users. the mean rank of daily posted and forwarded number and BAI only provide relative comparisons between provinces/cities with and without H7N9 cases. an official microblog could be effective to quickly clarify rumors."}
