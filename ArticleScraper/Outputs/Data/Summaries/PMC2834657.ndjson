{"summary": "HCVcc in culture medium was sensitive to heat and could be inactivated in 8 and 4 min when incubated at 60\u00b0C and 65\u00b0C, respectively. at 56\u00b0C, 40 min were required to eliminate HCVcc infectivity. the ability of HCVcc to survive ambient temperatures warrants precautions in handling and disposing of objects and materials that may have been contaminated with HCV. HCV affects an estimated 170 million people worldwide and is a global health problem. several related viruses in the family Flaviviridae can be readily cultured in vitro, e.g., bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV, genus Pestivirus) have been used as surrogates for HCV to study the inactivation process. a cell culture system based on a molecular clone, JFH-1, offers the opportunity of evaluating the reliable procedures for inactivating HCV. HCVcc stock (2.5 104 FFU/ml in culture medium) lost its infectivity after incubation at 37\u00b0C for 48 h. most of the infectivity loss occurred within the first 24 h. a further 0.4-log reduction in the following 16 h brought the virus titer down to (2.3 0.6) 101 FFU/ml. Aliquots (300 l) of an HCVcc stock with an initial infectious titer of 2.5 104 FFU/ml were incubated at 37\u00b0C (A), room temperature (B), or 4\u00b0C (C) in (B) the decay rate of HCVcc infectivity at room temperature was calculated as 0.254-log/day. aliquots of HCVcc stock (2.5 104 FFU/ml) were treated with three increasing temperatures. at 56\u00b0C HCVcc lost most of its infectivity within 30 min, with a 2.9-log reduction in viral titer. after 35 min, a very small amount of infectious virus was still detectable. the dashed line indicates the detection limit of the FFU assay (10 FFU/ml) the decay rate of HCVcc infectivity at 56\u00b0C was calculated as 0.089-log/min and 0.119-log/min, for HCVcc in culture medium (A) and human serum (C), respectively. viral titers declined rapidly following UVC irradiation, by 1.4- and 2.4-log, in the first 15 and 30 sec of exposure, respectively. after 45 sec, the viral titer decreased to a level [(2.7 1.2) 101 FFU/ml] close to the detection limit of the FFU assay. exposure to UVC light for 90 sec brought the viral titer down to a level that was close to the limit of detection. an additional 30-sec exposure completely eliminated the residual infectivity. 0.00037% formaldehyde and 0.0001% glutaraldehyde no longer had a demonstrable effect on cell viability. 0.01% glutaraldehyde exhibited a higher efficacy in viral inactivation. ten minutes of glutaraldehyde treatment resulted in more than 1-log reduction in infectivity. 103 NT 1.0 h (4.0 1.0) 103 NT 1.5 h (1.7 0.6) 103 NT 2.0 h 1.0 103b positive NT 2.5 h (1.7 0.6) 103 NT 4.0 h 1.0 103 negative negative Glutaraldehyde (0.01%) 0 min (4.0 0.3) 104a NT 10 min (1.8 0.2) 104a NT 10 min (1.8 0.2) 104a NT 10 min 104 NT NT 20 min (2.5 0.7) 103 NT 30 min 1.0 103 Positive NT 40 min 1.0 103 negative negative a Untreated viral samples were retitrated in culture medium containing 0.00037% formaldehyde or 0.0001% glutaraldehyde as controls. samples with positive results in FFU assay or at the second cell passage were not tested for NS3 staining for the third cell passage. detergent treatments on HCVcc infectivity Treatment Infectious titers before treatment (FFU/ml) a FFU assay after treatment IFA result at the 3rd cell passage 0.1% SDS HCVcc in culture medium (4.1 0.2) 104 negative negative HCVcc in human serum (9.5 0.7) 104 negative negative cell lysates (5.5 0.1) 105 negative negative 0.2% Triton X-100 HCVcc in culture medium (2.0 HCVcc stocks (4.1 104 FFU/ml) or those spiked in human serum (1.0 105 FFU/ml) were treated with 0.1% SDS, 0.2% Triton X-100, or 0.2% NP-40. control samples not treated with detergents showed no obvious loss in virus titers. the effect of detergents on disrupting intracellular HCVcc virions was also evaluated. the cellular HCVcc stock (2.5 104 FFU/ml in culture medium) lost its infectivity after incubation at 37\u00b0C for 48 h. most of the infectivity loss occurred within the first 24 h. incubation for every 2 days led to 0.4- to 0.5-log reduction in viral titers. we found no obvious reduction of infectivity even after five cycles of freezing and thawing of the JFH1 HCVcc stock. this suggests that HCVcc is relatively insensitive to freeze-thaw manipulation. the decay rate of HCVcc infectivity at room temperature was calculated as 0.254-log/day. aliquots of HCVcc stock (2.5 104 FFU/ml) were treated with three increasing temperatures (56\u00b0C, 60\u00b0C, and 65\u00b0C, respectively) at 56\u00b0C HCVcc lost most of its infectivity within 30 min, with a 2.9-log reduction in viral titer. after 35 min, a very small amount of infectious virus was still detectable. 105 FFU/ml were incubated in water baths at 56\u00b0C (A and C), 60\u00b0C and 65\u00b0C (B and D) at indicated time points post incubation, samples were removed, cooled on ice-water bath, and their residual infectivity titrated on Huh7-25-CD81 cells. asterisks denote time points when infectivity was eliminated completely. CVcc infectivity, 200-l aliquots of HCVcc stock (2.5 104 FFU/ml) were placed in 48-well plates and subjected to UVC light irradiation for different time points. after 45 sec, the viral titer decreased to a level [(2.7 1.2) 101 FFU/ml] close to the detection limit of the FFU assay. an 1.6-log decrease in viral infectivity was observed after 30 sec of irradiation. exposure to UVC light for 90 sec brought the viral titer down to a level that was close to the limit of detection. an additional 30-sec exposure completely eliminated the residual infectivity. at 2 h posttreatment of formaldehyde, a single fluorescent focus was detected in one of the triplicate wells in the FFU assay. however, a positive IFA result was observed at the second cell passage. no residual infectivity could be detected up to the third cell passage. culture medium Treatment Infectious titer (FFU/ml) IFA result 2nd cell passage 3rd cell passage Formaldehyde (0.037%) 0 h (3.9 0.3) 104a NTc NT 0.5 h (1.1 0.1) 104a NTc NT 1.0 h (4.0 1.0) 103 NT 1.5 h (1.7 0.6) 103 NT NT 2.0 h 1.0 103b positive NT 2.5 NT 3.0 h (1.0 0.0) 103 NT 4.0 h 1.0 103 negative negative Glutaraldehyde (0.01%) 0 min (9.5 0.7) 104a NT 10 min (1.8 0.2) 104a NT 20 min (2.5 0.7) 103 NT 30 min 1.0 103 Positive NT 40 min 1.0 103 negative negative negative a Untreated viral samples were retitrated in culture medium containing 0.00037% formalde the control, PBS-treated samples showed no obvious loss of infectivity when titrated in the presence of 0.00037% formaldehyde or 0.0001% glutaraldehyde. these results suggest that both of the aldehydes are able to inactivate HCVcc, regardless of the presence of human serum in HCVcc stocks. infected cells were treated with individual, serially diluted detergents. all of the detergent-treated samples were negative in the FFU assay. no infectivity was detected from any of these cell lysates. oculated cells, while the control cell lysate prepared by freezing and thawing in the absence of any detergents retained high infectivity. a detailed analysis was conducted on the stability of HCVcc at various environmental temperatures. also evaluated was the efficacy of several conventional viral inactivation procedures in eliminating HCVc infectivity. iridae have been shown to be sensitive to heat treatment. yellow fever virus is routinely inactivated at 56\u00b0C for 30 min. at 60\u00b0C, BVDV and yellow fever virus have been reported to be inactivated effectively in 30 and 5 min. UVC light irradiation represents a highly effective means for inactivating HCVcc. the irradiation dose required for each specific occasion may depend on the sample volume and its initial viral titer. formalin (37% formaldehyde) treatment is the most used technique for preparing inactivated virus vaccines. the infectivity of viral samples could be analyzed at only the 100-fold dilution, which may somehow have reduced the sensitivity of the assay. the routinely used concentrations of aldehydes for fixation purposes are far in excess of the ones examined in the current study. 0.0005% Triton X-100 and 0.0005% NP-40 had no detectable effect on cell viability. the residual Triton X-100 or NP-40 still had some disruptive effect on virion integrity, which is important for viral infectivity. however, the detergent-treated samples were not diluted further for the infectivity test. cell culture and virus stocks The Huh7-25-CD81 cell line was used throughout the experiments. this cell line was 1.5-fold more sensitive for titration of HCVcc infectivity than the Huh7.5.1 cell line. cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 10 mM HEPES (Invitrogen) and 400 g/ml G418 (Merck, Germany) at 37\u00b0C in the concentrated virus stock (1.1 106 FFU/ml) was then diluted 11-fold in normal human serum that had been heat-inactivated to achieve an infectious titer of 1.0 105 FFU/ml. this human serum was stored at -70\u00b0C in aliquots until use. the number of fluorescent foci per well at appropriate dilutions were counted. the infectious titers, expressed as FFU/ml, were calculated from the average foci number of triplicate or duplicate. the detection limit of the assay was 10 FFU/ml. for viral stability assays for HCVcc spiked in normal human serum (1.0 105 FFU/ml), aliquots were incubated at RT and removed every 7 days for titration. all the time points selected in the experiments were designed based on the results of several pilot experiments. MTT cytotoxicity assay was carried out to determine concentrations of aldehydes or detergents at which they were no longer cytotoxic to Huh7-25-CD81 cell. solutions of aldehydes (37% formaldehyde and 50% glutaraldehyde) or detergents were diluted serially in cell culture medium. after 6 h of incubation at 37\u00b0C, treated cells were refed with 100 l of fresh culture medium. formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde treatments Formaldehyde (37%) or glutaraldehyde (50%) solutions were diluted in PBS at 1:10 (formaldehyde) or 1:50 (glutaraldehyde), then added to 500-l viral samples. treated samples were diluted 100-fold in culture medium immediately to stop the inactivation reaction. 1% Triton X-100 (v/v), or 1% NP-40 (v/v) were added to 500-l aliquots of viral samples. treated samples were diluted 100-fold (SDS-treated samples) or 400-fold (Triton X-100- or NP-40-treated samples) immediately in culture medium to negate cytotoxic effect of detergents. the supernatants of cell lysates were diluted 100-fold (SDS-lysed samples) or 400-fold (Triton X-100- or NP-40-lysed samples) in culture medium for infectivity assays. as control, infected cells washed extensively with PBS were pelleted and resuspended in 50 l PBS and lysed by three cycles of freezing and thawing (-70\u00b0C to 37\u00b0C culture supernatants were harvested, clarified by centrifugation (5 min at 4000 rpm) and stored in aliquots at -70\u00b0C as the HCVcc stock. the infectious titer of the virus stock was determined by focus-forming unit (FFU) assay. cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature (RT), blocked for 60 min in a blocking buffer (3% BSA, 0.3% Triton X-100, 10% FBS in PBS) after 2 h incubation, cells were incubated with an FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Beijing Zhongshanjinqiao, China) at 1:100 dilution for 1 h aliquots were dispensed into 300-l aliquots in tightly capped, 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes. aliquots were incubated at 37\u00b0C, RT (25 2\u00b0C), and stored at -70\u00b0C until virus titration on Huh7-25-CD81 cells. 104 FFU/ml or HCVcc diluted in normal human serum (1.0 105 FFU/ml) were placed in 48-well plates to give a volume depth of about 0.2 cm. exposed to continuous UVC light 30 cm beneath the longitudinal midpoint of a UVC lamp. control samples were set up in parallel and incubated for the same time period but protected from UVC light. the treated cells were refed with 100 l of fresh culture medium. after an additional 72 h, 20 l of MTT solution (5 mg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to each well. the absorbance of solution in each well was measured at 490 nm. the presence of 0.00037% formaldehyde or 0.0001% glutaraldehyde had no appreciable effect on the viability of Huh7-25-CD81 cells. samples with negative results in FFU assay were subjected to the residual infectivity test. infected cells were pelleted and resuspended in 50 l PBS containing 0.1% SDS, or 0.2% Triton X-100, or 0.2% NP-40. infectivity of supernatants was titrated on the cells. authors declare that they have no competing interests. all Authors have read and approved the final manuscript. all authors have read and approved the final manuscript."}
