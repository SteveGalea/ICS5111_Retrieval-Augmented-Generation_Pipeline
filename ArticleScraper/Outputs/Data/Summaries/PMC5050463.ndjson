{"summary": "stock cultures were diluted in DMEM supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2 mmol/L L-glutamine. cells were inoculated with 10-fold serial dilutions of virus and scored for cytopathic effect 14 days later. at 6 L/min, humidified make-up air was introduced simultaneously into the drum. both generator and sampler were calibrated using a frictionless bubble meter (Gilibrator; Sensidyne) both generator and sampler were calibrated using a frictionless bubble meter (Gilibrator; Sensidyne) samples were collected for quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and virus titration. one-step qRT-PCR targeting the Ebola virus L gene was performed on a Qiagen Rotor-Gene Q PCR cycler using QuantiFast reagents. fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2 mmol/L L-glutamine were titrated by end-point titration in quadruplicate in vero E6 cells cultured in DMEM supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum, 1 mmol/L L-glutamine, 50 U/mL penicillin and 50 g/mL streptomycin. cells were inoculated with 10-fold serial dilution airflow and humidity were controlled and airflow, humidity and temperatures were monitored using the AeroPlus aerosol management platform (AeroMP; Biaera Technologies) the drum was loaded with aerosolized DMEM with 10% FBS, then humidified air passed through the drum for 5 minutes to clear it, at a flow rate of 10.5 L/min. one-step qRT-PCR targeting the Ebola virus L gene was performed on a Qiagen Rotor-Gene Q PCR cycler using QuantiFast reagents. the steps for qRT-PCR were as follows: reverse-transcription at 63\u00b0C for 3 minutes and initial PCR activation at 95\u00b0C for 30 seconds. the RNA genome copy number was calculated using in vitro transcribed copies of a section of the L gene. 105 L of humidified aerosol was generated and passed through the drum to create an aerosolized environment inside the drum. qRT-PCR was used to monitor the genome copy number of the aerosolized virus suspension as a proxy for the amount of aerosol still in suspension. all viability measurements were then normalized to the viral genome copies that remained in suspension. the slope of the nonlinear regression of the nonnormalized data is 0.0029. the slope of the nonlinear regression for the normalized data is 0.0016. the time required for a reduction of 1 log TCID50 was calculated to be 619 minutes, or 0.43 days. qRT-PCR was used to monitor the genome copy number of the aerosolized virus suspension as a proxy for the amount of aerosol still in suspension. all viability measurements were then normalized to the viral genome copies that remained in suspension. the time required for a reduction of 1 log TCID50 was calculated to be 619 minutes, or 0.43 days. this is similar to the decay rate reported elsewhere for virus dried on stainless steel or plastic at 27\u00b0C (0.45 days for both substances) a higher starting titer would allow a more accurate assessment of the loss of virus viability over time. a second limitation is that within the drum the aerosol is confined to the volume of the drum. EBOV Makona 2014 can survive within an aerosol at 22\u00b0C and 80% relative humidity."}
