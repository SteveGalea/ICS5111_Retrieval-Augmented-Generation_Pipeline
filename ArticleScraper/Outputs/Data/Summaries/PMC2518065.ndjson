{"summary": "Background Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) was first reported in November 2002 in china. it spreads to about 30 countries over the next few months. the characteristics of epidemic transmission are individually assessed. but there are also important implicit associations between them. composite space-time variations, disease parameters and determinants are essential features of the SARS epidemic. in general, the evolution of an epidemic is represented in terms of some kind of a mechanistic model. in the case of SARS, only datasets of various kinds are available. a system of the general form f(R, C, F,, s, t) = 0, is constructed on the basis of the available datasets. the underlying epidemic mechanisms (usually represented in terms of differential equations) are not considered in this formulation, but they will be the topic of forthcoming publications. the model is based on the theoretical considerations discussed in Hamer24 and Anderson. similar dynamic models have been used in early SARS studies. the black-white join-count test was used to measure the extent to which districts of a disease network shared the same infection pattern. each day a district was coded black (B) if a SARS case was reported on that day; otherwise it was coded white (W). the observed number of BW joints was compared with the expected number. datasets The first SARS case in Beijing was recorded on 1 March 2003. the city consists of 16 districts and 2 counties, with a total population of 12.5 million people occupying an area of 17 800 km2. data was collected by exhaustively tracing SARS cases from 20 April 2003. other data that were considered relevant to the epidemic were also obtained. population counts in 246 census units, hospital locations, number of doctors in each hospital and the topography of the main traffic lines. the nearest-neighbour hierarchical clustering model (appendix 3) was used to identify spatial patterns of SARS distribution. points were randomly distributed in space and circled in a spatial cluster, if their inter-distance was significantly smaller than the mean distance. seven networks were considered as follows: N1. Local transmission: Two districts were connected if they shared a common geographical boundary. N4. Population density: The same as in N3, but ranked by population density, instead. \u2018C T\u2019 denotes that C and T are associated (connected). separate statistics The time process of SARS transmission, R(t) and the transmission rate in (t) were simulated using the SEIR model. the time-variation of a4 and d4 indicated that spatial clustering was sharply declining. after 9 May 2003, the time-variation of a4 and d4 indicated that spatial clustering was sharply declining. seven suspect determinants of the space-time SARS transmission were investigated by means of the BW join-count test. the \u2018A m B\u2019 means that A is linked to B via m; and the \u2018AB\u2019 denotes that B is inferred from A. the larger spatial clusters C(s) were controlled by the urban traffic loops T(s), i.e. a proxy of the macro spatial proximity, T(t), the influence of which to the epidemic is detectable and changes with time. this trend was interrupted by a significant transmission between rural and urban areas on 15\u201318 May 2003. driving forces of spatial clustering Inference was based on the rule 4. larger spatial clusters C(t) (associated with the a4 component in Fig. 2) had a consistent trend. smaller clusters C(t) (d4 component in Fig. 2) were still building up, driven by significant P (population density) and D (number of doctors) during the specified time period. the role of the traffic T in F was to control the larger C0(s) and C(t) [Eq. (4)]. The larger C(s) occurred during the peak R(t)-values and the smaller C(s) occurred during the decline phase of the epidemic. peak and decline times of the epidemic spread were the best times to efficiently conduct travel-related control at the ring roads T and the doctor (D)- and population (P)-related measures. the curve was decomposed into a low-frequency component (a4) and high-frequency components (d1, d2, d3, d4). the time-variation of a4 indicated that SARS cases in Beijing became increasingly clustered towards the end of April, 2003. after 9 May 2003, the time-variation of a4 and d4 indicated that spatial clustering was sharply declining. 'a&B' means A and B; \u2018A m B\u2019 means that A is linked to B via m; and the \u2018AB\u2019 denotes that B is inferred from A. the larger spatial clusters in Fig. 1 are randomly distributed over space, which is consistent with the spatial distribution of the population P and the number of doctors D. the rapid decline of the daily new cases R(t) and the infective rate in (t) after 30 April 2003 was predominantly driven by the spatial proximity T(t) and intermittently accompanied by the interaction between (infected) doctors D and the urban population density P. this trend was interrupted by a significant transmission between rural and urban areas on 15\u201318 May 2003 (Fig. 3h) the 6 demonstrates the spatiotemporal (s, t) dynamics of the observed spatial clusters (C) and the corresponding determinants F(t) on a daily basis. the 7 represents the fact that the observed time series of the infected cases R(t) was driven by the spatial clustering variable C(t) and the epidemic determinants F(t) the role of the traffic T in F was to control the larger C(s) [Eq. (2)] and C(t) Fig. 1 clearly shows that there are spatial clusters at two C(s) scales, whereas Fig. 2 depicts the time series of the spatial clustering of the two scales. the large cluster (lower frequency part, left curve in Fig. 2) grew until 30 April 2003 and diffused into smaller clusters thereafter. both the larger and the smaller clusters lost their strength after 8 May 2003. intervention Inference was based on the rule 5 that the larger spatial clusters represented by the a4 component of C(t) dominated the trend throughout the entire epidemic period. the smaller clusters reflected in the d4 component of C(t) became more active during the decline period. determinants and the relevant statistics are pair-wise linked in a space-time context. the study of determinant associations can considerably enhance the mainstream epidemic analysis and improve the understanding of previously undetected relationships. more than one statistic has to be calculated in epidemic data analysis. the hierarchical clustering is implemented by the Crimestat software (http://www.geoda.uiuc.edu/CRIMESTAT/) the hierarchical clustering is implemented by the Crimestat software (http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/). only a limited number of studies have attempted to represent and evaluate determinant associations and links between separate statistics under conditions of uncertainty. the present work is the first systematic effort to represent the aforementioned associations and links in a rigorous manner. a wide variety of inter-disciplinary datasets that are relevant to the epidemic spread can be integrated by means of this framework. statistics functions and spatial analysis techniques described above can be readily applied to the study of epidemics other than SARS. the methodological framework is not limited to the statistical tools and datasets considered in this paper. the results suggest that improving control measures at the local level would have been the most efficient approach, before the end of April, 2003. the results suggest that improving control measures at the local level would have been the most efficient approach. a common modelling practice to use a single or several separate data statistics to investigate individual epidemic properties and determinants. only a limited number of studies have attempted to partially represent and evaluate determinant associations and links between separate statistics under conditions of uncertainty. this work is the first systematic effort to represent the aforementioned associations and links in a rigorous manner. approach can be successfully implemented to simulate the response of SARS transmission to various epidemic control factors, identify target areas and determine the critical time and relevant factors. findings of present study can be useful in the implementation of efficient epidemic intervention strategies and effective population protection policies.
