{"summary": "we examined the rates of DAI by antimicrobial-resistant pathogens and 30\u2013day and in\u2013hospital mortality in the intensive care unit. the most common DAI type was catheter\u2013associated urinary tract infection (3.76 per 1000 urinary catheter\u2013days) there was a decrease in DAI rates in 2005 and rates of ventilator\u2013associated pneumonia (VAP, 3.18 per 1000 ventilator\u2013days) have remained low since then. effective surveillance could reduce the NI rate on average about 20\u201330%. surveillance of device-associated infections in intensive care units has become more important owing to the more frequent employment of advanced life support devices. prospective surveillance was conducted to determine the DAI rate and prevalence of antibiotic-resistant isolates at an adult medical\u2013surgical ICU. our aim was to analyze the secular trend of incidence for different types of DAIs, determine the common pathogens involved, and determine the rates of antimicrobial resistance and overall 30\u2013day and in\u2013hospital mortality. ibilities, invasive procedures, and overall 30\u2013day mortality and in\u2013hospital crude mortality were recorded. data were also collected for each exposed patient in the prospective hospital database, including demographics and clinical characteristics. a symptomatic UTI occurred in a patient who had an indwelling urinary catheter in place within the 48 hour period before the onset of the UTI. a urine sample was aseptically aspirated from the sampling port of a urinary catheter and cultured quantitatively. the DU ratio was calculated as the number of device\u2013days per number of patient\u2013days. the overall and site\u2013specific DAI rates were analyzed by chi\u2013square test. logistic regression with a stepwise forward approach was used to assess prognostic factors of mortality. all DAIs of the Outcome Surveillance Component were categorized using standard US CDC NHSN definitions. the involved patient demographic information, the dates and sites of infection, device\u2013utilization ratio, pathogens, antimicrobial susceptibilities, invasive procedures, and overall 30\u2013day mortality. central catheter\u2013tip colonization was defined as isolation of 15 colony\u2013forming units from a central catheter tip by using the roll\u2013plate semiquantitative Maki\u2019s culture technique. a urine sample was aseptically aspirated from the sampling port of a urinary catheter. pathogens were isolated from other specimens using standard methods specified by the Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI) 2008. Statistical analysis The NI rate was defined as the number of NIs per 1,000 device days. patient days were calculated as the number of ICU days of the non\u2013NI cohort or the number of ICU days after the onset of NI. the crude mortality rate was 14.4% during the study period. most patients were admitted due to major medical conditions (59%), such as neoplasms (22.2%), digestive system problems (20.7%), and respiratory system problems (17.8%). ratio in device-associated infections from 2000 to 2008 Device type 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Overall pvalue Patient days 13,915 14,144 14,144 14,021 14,274 14,206 13,753 14,049 13,809 126,315 Ventilator\u2013associated pneumonia, n 21 47 32 44 41 29 23 30 25 292 Ventilator\u2013days 11,211 8,941 9,101 9,246 9,420 11,121 10,778 11,545 10,548 91,911 Rate per 1000 a total of 1,290 pathogens were isolated from clinical specimens during 2000-2008. acinetobacter baumannii (23%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (18.2%), and Staphylococcus aureus (17.4%) were the three most common pathogens associated with VAP. non-albicans Candida (NAC spp.) rather than bacteria were the most common CAUTI pathogens, followed by Enterococci the rate of antibiotic resistance every year is presented in Table 3.
