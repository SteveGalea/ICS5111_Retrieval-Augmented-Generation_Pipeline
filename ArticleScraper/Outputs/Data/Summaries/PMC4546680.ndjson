{"summary": "CMV antigen (CMV-3A) was immobilized on silicon wafers. an antibody against human immunoglobulin G (anti-IgG) was used to confirm the IgG antibody against CMV captured by the CMV-3A. conventional ELISA is still the main diagnostic test for CMV, and commercial CMV ELISA Kits are available. a rapid, simple, direct, and high-throughput method for CMV antibody detection is urgently needed. new applications have recently been developed, including those for the analysis of the interaction between tropomyosin allergens and antibodies [23], and the interaction between soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor (SNARE) proteins [24]. antibodies against CMV qualitatively were detected using BIE. then, goat antibody against human IgG (anti-IgG) was added to the area with the captured CMV antibody to confirm IgG antibody against CMV. microplates coated with native CMV antigens, highly purified by sucrose gradient centrifugation and inactivated. the solid phase was first treated with the diluted sample. bound anti-CMV IgG molecules were detected by the addition of specific polyclonal anti-H-IgG antibodies labelled with peroxidase (HRP) imaging ellipsometry combines high spatial resolution imaging ellipsometry with a microfluidic system to analyze biomolecular interaction. the microfluidic system is used for surface patterning and array production, as well as for solution delivery, ligand immobilization and target capture. surface modification silicon wafers were cut into 2010 mm2 rectangles and rinsed with deionized water. after soaking in piranha solution (30% H2O2:98% H2SO4 = 1:3, vol/vol) the wafers were incubated in a saturated solution of succinic anhydride in ethanol for 2 h with gentle agitation. a piece of silicon wafer was placed on the microfluidic mold of the microfluidic system so that surfaces of the wafers were patterned to form small, regular cells in an array format. the carboxyl groups were activated by pumping 10 L of NE into each cell at a flow rate of 5 L/min and passed through the surface of the wafer. PBST buffer was added as blank control to two areas on the second row. normal serum without CMV antibodies was added as negative control to two areas on the third row. sample 933 and 978 had medium CMV antibody concentrations. samples with higher concentrations were chosen to observe qualitative detection. five levels of serial dilution containing 0.011, 0.043, 0.170, 0.681, and 2.725 IU/mL were prepared in PBST. PBST buffer, CMV antibody and normal serum without CMV antibody were added as blank, positive, and negative controls (respectively) to the first, second, and third rows. the concentrations of antibodies in samples of unknown concentration could be determined on the curve according to their grayscale values. commercial ELISA CMV antibody kits were used as controls according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. anti-IgG and a goat antibody against human IgM (anti-IgM) were purchased from the company. the fusion of the multi-epitope enhances the sensitivity/specificity and reduces false negatives. NE solution was prepared with NHS (0.05 M) and EDC (0.2 M) in deionized water. PBST buffer was prepared with 1% Tween-20 in PBS. PBST buffer was prepared with 1% Tween-20 in PBS. the physical size of each cell was 1.510.5 mm3. the inlet micro-channels were placed into sample plate. the outlet micro-channels were connected with pumps. solution (30% H2O2:98% H2SO4 = 1:3, vol/vol) for 30 min to increase the number of silanol groups on the wafer surface. rinsing with deionized water and ethanol, the wafers were incubated in a saturated solution of succinic anhydride in ethanol for 3 h with gentle agitation. PBST was used as blank control (50 L per cell at 1 L/min) and purified CMV antibody as a positive control (50 L per cell at 1 L/min) all cells were rinsed with PBST (20 L per cell at 20 L/min) between every two consecutive operation steps. ultaneously, purified CMV antibody (0.1 mg/mL) was added as positive control to two areas on the third row. three patient serum samples (No. 956, 933, and 978) were analyzed on the following rows. IgG and anti-IgM were added to third and fourth rows to identify and confirm if the antibody captured by the ligand was IgG or IgM. PBST buffer was added as blank control to remaining areas. concentration plotted on the X-axis and variation of the grayscale value compared to blank control was plotted on the Y-axis to generate the calibration curve. Fig 3. Calibration curve and sensitivity of BIE for detecting CMV antibodies. the same serum sample was measured in two duplicate areas. the same serum sample was measured in two duplicate areas. the same serum sample was measured in two duplicate areas. the average grayscale value of the serum samples analyzed significantly increased relative to the controls. the mean serum value was 253.58 0.49, and the mean grayscale value of serum minus the mean grayscale value of the blank control was 136.1 (P = 2.8105), indicating that CMV antibodies were abundant in the serum samples. the change in signal intensity was consistent with the increase in CMV antibody concentration. the grayscale values of the blank control were 124.7 0.5, and the grayscale values of the dilutions as low as 0.01 IU/mL were 132.3 0.1. concentration of CMV antibody (0.5 IU/mL) located in the normal reference range (0.4\u20130.6 IU/mL) the correlation coefficient (r-value) and P-value were calculated. compared to blank controls areas, the purified CMV antibody and patient serum sample detection areas had markedly thicker films. negative control areas did not. gG minus the mean grayscale value of the blank control was 96.2 (P = 0.003) the mean value of the anti-IgM minus the mean grayscale value of the blank control was 8.15 (P = 0.29) these data are indicative of the specific interactions between the anti-IgG and the human IgG immobilized on the chip. the sensitivity of the assay reached 0.01 IU/mL or less. each variation in grayscale value was linked to a corresponding concentration of the CMV antibody over the range of 0.011\u20132.725 IU/mL. antibody detection is widely available for the clinical diagnosis of CMV infection. however, the identification of antibody types may help to determine the course of disease, and BIE may be used as a clinical primary screening tool for CMV patients. ELISA as a control method had a reference range of 0.4\u20130.6 IU/mL. the sensitivity of our BIE biosensor is below the reference range. however, there is a substantial discordance between the ELISA and the BIE in some patients.
