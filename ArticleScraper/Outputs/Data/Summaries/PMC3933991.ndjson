{"summary": "Campylobacter spp. are curved or spiral shaped flagellated bacteria with a size of 0.2\u20130.5 m length and a width of 0.2\u20130.9 m. among these species, some show strict host specificity such as Campylobacter (C.) rectus for man or C. mucosalis for pig. some species such as C. jejuni subsp. jejuni or C. coli are linked to more than one host and poultry meat is considered to be one of the major sources for human campylobacteriosis. beside poultry and raw poultry meat other sources for C. jejuni have been described such as livestock, including sheep and pigs, but also cats and dogs. the uptake of the pathogen by poultry species from the environment usually occurs between the age of two to four weeks. but also birds younger than three weeks can be colonized successfully in the case of high environmental exposure. the C. jejuni-prevalence within a flock is almost 100% after introduction. a possible reason for different Campylobacter colonisation patterns may be genetic diversity of C. jejuni isolates. only one strain of avian origin showed the ability to also invade the liver. this observation supports previous studies showing low detection rates of Campylobacter in liver samples too. the genetic background of the host may also be due to host factors. infection induces an increase of T cell receptor (TCR), TCR, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in chicken caecum. this increase coincides with cytokine upregulation such as IL-12, IL-18 and IL-2 indicating the stimulation of a T cell response. ylobacter isolates of human and avian origin have to be investigated. comparison of the relative percent of CD4+ T cells of intraepithelial lymphocytes of a non-inoculated and a group, inoculated with a human (hu) C. jejuni strain. IFN- is the only type II class interferon secreted by a variety of cells. it acts as a regulatory and effector molecule for inflammatory responses. the cytokine expression pattern of IL-6 and IFN- in caecum and jejunum did not significantly differ between non-inoculated and non-inoculated birds. circumstantial evidence that the immune response in the first three days may significantly affect the outcome of Campylobacter colonisation and infection. other predisposing factors may contribute to the systemic spread of Campylobacter in birds and the induction of lesions."}
