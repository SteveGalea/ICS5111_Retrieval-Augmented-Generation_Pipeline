{"summary": "the consequences of transmission in terms of infection severity and outcome must be weighed against the consequences of preventive measures taken. physicians must decide whether the benefits of an office in which children are free to play with each other, share toys, and generally practice their social skills outweigh the risks of infections that may be acquired there. young children have 4 to 10 respiratory infections and up to 4 episodes of gastroenteritis per year (16,17) they can acquire infections in child care, at school, in crowded shopping malls or recreational centres, or from siblings, parents, other family contacts, friends, or caregivers. no increased risk of infection was observed in control children from the same paediatric practice who had not visited the office in the same period. cuffs have been implicated in the transmission of Clostridium difficile and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) the risk of transmission among patients may be less in an office setting than on a hospital ward. in offices, the duration of contact between individuals is shorter, patients are generally in better health and fewer invasive procedures are performed. young children have 4 to 10 respiratory infections and up to 4 episodes of gastroenteritis per year (16,17) they can acquire infections in child care, at school, in crowded shopping malls or recreational centres or from siblings, parents, other family contacts, friends, or caregivers. ncytial virus (RSV) (29) survive on stethoscope diaphragms. Contaminated electronic thermometer bases and blood pressure cuffs implicated. children who lack immunity to the infecting agent and those who are ill, debilitated or immunocompromised are at increased risk for disease. increased awareness led to recommendations for a new standard of patient behaviour, \u2018Respiratory Etiquette\u2019, in ambulatory care settings. outpatient settings are being urged to implement source containment measures to prevent transmission of respiratory infections. appropriate antibiotic received or pertussis ruled out Rubella Droplet To 7 days after onset of rash Rubella contact, nonimmune, in incubation period Droplet From 7 days after the first day of exposure to 21 days after last day of exposure. to 28 days if given varicella zoster immune globulin Viral respiratory tract infection (diagnosed or suspected) data taken from references (1,4,41,58\u201360) includes hand, foot, and mouth disease. tuberculosis should be considered contagious in individuals with untreated cavitary pulmonary disease. wear surgical or procedure masks was recommended for persons within 1 m of the patient until recently. concern that large droplets may travel further than 1 m led to extend this distance to 2 m, while recognizing that 1m is probably sufficient for young children and others whose cough is not forceful (1). some organisms transmitted by droplet transmission are fragile and do not survive long enough on surfaces to be picked up on the hands of patients or personnel. special tight-fitting masks with built-in filters are recommended for susceptible persons who must enter the room. airborne transmission is uncommon but important because varicella, measles, tuberculosis, and smallpox are spread by this route. items that are only in contact with intact skin require low-level disinfection designed to inactivate all micro-organisms. most examination equipment in an office setting is in contact with only the patient\u2019s intact skin. cleaning with detergent and water is sufficient for noncritical equipment (6,45) water considered sufficient by some authorities 70% to 90% ethyl or isopropyl alcohol (immersion >5 min), sodium hypochlorite 5.25% diluted 1:50 to 1:500 (immersion >10 min), 3% hydrogen peroxide, 0.5% accelerated hydrogen peroxide, quaternary ammonium products, iodine, iodophors, phenolics, disinfectant wipes. soft toys were effectively decontaminated by cleaning and soaking for 1 hour in a bleach solution. soft toys were again contaminated with coliforms, whereas hard toys were not. authors concluded soft toys were unsuitable for doctors\u2019 waiting rooms. coliforms were found on 90% of soft toys and 13.5% of hard toys. soft toys were effectively decontaminated by cleaning and soaking for 1 hour in a bleach solution. by 1 week of use, soft toys were again contaminated with coliforms. policies and procedures for infection control and prevention should be developed and implemented (1\u20133). ongoing education should include how infections are transmitted, infection control measures, recognition of symptom complexes, prevention and management of potential exposures to blood-borne viruses, and cleaning and disinfection of equipment, toys, and surfaces. children with suspected or diagnosed airborne infections should be quickly removed from a common waiting area. ask whether there are persons in the same household who have a respiratory illness and travelled outside Canada in the 21 days before illness onset. Providing toys for infants and young children that can be cleaned easily and frequently (2,5,6) choose toys with smooth, solid surfaces and avoid toys with small pieces or creviced surfaces. older children who are mature enough to practice hand hygiene appropriately may share toys, books, puzzles, and computer games. parents and children should be instructed about the need for hand hygiene (1,6,52). alcohol-based hand rinses should be placed out of reach of children. hand cleansing towelettes are an alternative to soap and water for cleaning of visibly soiled hands. ills of blood or bloody body fluids should be contained promptly and cleaned with detergent followed by bleach. Mouthpieces, resuscitation bags or other ventilation devices should be readily available in areas where the need to resuscitate may be required. personnel with risk for exposure to body fluids should receive hepatitis B vaccine, be tested for anti-hepatitis B antibody after vaccination and be informed of their hepatitis B immune status (2,56,57). items contaminated with blood or body fluids should undergo low-level disinfection. if this is not feasible, clean daily, and immediately when soiled (2,3,6). items designed for single-patient use should not be used for more than one patient (1,3,5,6) if soiled with body fluids or stool, clean and disinfect with a 1:100 bleach solution (2,3,5,6) washrooms should be cleaned daily and when soiled. surfaces such as countertops, chairs, and floors are usually not an infection risk. the preferred agent for venipuncture or immunization is 70% alcohol. 2% chlorhexidine, chlorhexidine in 70% alcohol, 10% povidone-iodine or an alcoholic tincture of iodine should be used. patients with a febrile respiratory illness should be placed directly into an examining room (1,2,5,6). patients with known or suspected measles, varicella, disseminated zoster, or contagious tuberculosis should be placed directly into an examining room (1,2,5,6). patients should be examined and discharged as quickly as possible (1,2) a portable HEPA filtration unit can be used to create a negative-pressure room. patients should wear a surgical or procedure mask when not in a negative-pressure room. patients with suspected meningitis, pertussis, rubella, mumps, or meningococcal infection should be placed in an examining room. if this is not possible, separate the patient from other patients by 1 m to 2 m and keep the time spent in the waiting room to an absolute minimum. a gown should be worn when clothing will have direct contact with the patient. remove the gown before leaving the room (1,4\u20136) Perform hand hygiene using an antiseptic alcohol-based hand rinse or gel. airborne Precautions are recommended when performing aerosol-generating procedures. patients with suspected Ebola virus infections should not be managed in an office setting. all personnel should receive influenza vaccine annually (1,2,56) in some jurisdictions, pre-employment testing may be required only for clinics where tuberculosis patients are frequently seen. policies should be developed and implemented outlining work restrictions for personnel with communicable infections. personnel should not have direct contact with high-risk patients, should contain coughs and respiratory secretions. lesions on hands Lesions elsewhere with exudates or drainage that cannot be effectively contained by dressings Staphylococcal skin infection (MRSA) from direct patient care. lesions on hands Lesions elsewhere with exudates or drainage that cannot be effectively contained by dressing. medical waste Regulated medical waste should be disposed of according to local legislation. nonanatomical medical waste includes (1\u20136): Liquid or semiliquid blood and blood products. items contaminated with blood that would release liquid or semiliquid blood if compressed. children with transmissible infections should be segregated from well children. parents should be advised to inform receptionist immediately upon arrival. signs should be posted in appropriate locations reminding parents and patients to do this. infants and young children with vomiting, diarrhea, fever, cough or open skin lesions should be in the waiting room for as short a time as possible, placed in an examination room as soon as possible. options include: removing toys from waiting rooms, unless their use can be supervised and appropriate cleaning is feasible. children mature enough to practice hand hygiene and handle respiratory secretions appropriately may share toys, books, puzzles, and computer games. alcohol-based waterless hand rinses should contain 60% to 90% isopropyl or ethyl alcohol. gloves are not needed for routine child care, such as wiping a nose or changing a diaper. a surgical mask or procedure mask should be worn only once and changed when wet or soiled (1\u20136) personnel with risk for exposure to body fluids should receive hepatitis B vaccine, be tested for anti-hepatitis B antibody after vaccination and be informed of their hepatitis B immune status (2,56,57). guidance should include procedures for injured personnel: how to obtain immediate advice, clinical assessment, and access to postexposure prophylaxis. items designed for single-patient use (e.g., glucometers) should not be used for more than one patient (1,3,5,6) clean equipment should be stored where it will not become contaminated (2,6) measures should be taken to avoid contaminating bases of electronic thermometers, pulse oxymetry and tympanometry equipment. frequently touched surfaces should be cleaned daily and when soiled. surfaces such as countertops, chairs, and floors should be cleaned weekly or on a routine basis. toys used by infants and young children should be cleaned between uses by different patients. invasive procedures, and for obtaining blood cultures, should be used. 2% chlorhexidine, chlorhexidine in 70% alcohol, 10% povidone-iodine or an alcoholic tincture of iodine should be left to dry for 2 minutes (2,6,35) health care personnel should perform hand hygiene using alcohol-based waterless hand rinses or soap and water (1\u20136,51,52). alcohol-based hand rinses should contain 60% to 90% isopropyl or ethyl alcohol (51,52) hand cleansing towelettes are an alternative to soap and water for cleaning of visibly soiled hands. Gloves are not needed for routine child care, such as wiping a nose or changing a diaper. personnel with risk for exposure to body fluids should receive hepatitis B vaccine, be tested for anti-hepatitis B antibody after vaccination and be informed of their hepatitis B immune status (2,56,57). guidance should include procedures for injured personnel: how to obtain immediate advice, clinical assessment, and access to postexposure prophylaxis. items designed for single-patient use (e.g., glucometers) should not be used for more than one patient (1,3,5,6) clean equipment should be stored where it will not become contaminated (2,6) tables, chairs, sinks, and other frequently touched surfaces should be cleaned daily and when soiled. other surfaces, including cupboards, walls, windows, and air vents, should be cleaned at least annually and as needed to maintain an appropriate standard of cleanliness. toys used by infants and young children should be cleaned between uses by different patients. insertion of intravascular catheters and other invasive procedures should be used. 2% chlorhexidine, chlorhexidine in 70% alcohol, 10% povidone-iodine or an alcoholic tincture of iodine should be left to dry for 2 minutes (2,6,35) patients with a febrile respiratory illness should be placed directly into an examining room (1,2,5,6). patients with known or suspected measles, varicella, disseminated zoster, or contagious tuberculosis should be placed directly into an examining room (1,2,5,6) patients should wear a surgical or procedure mask when not in a negative-pressure room. for suspected or known contagious tuberculosis, N95 masks should always be available. personnel should be fit-tested and perform a fit check every time a mask is put on (5). patients with suspected meningitis, pertussis, rubella, mumps, or meningococcal infection should be placed in an examining room as soon as possible (1,5) if this is not possible, separate the infected patient from other patients by 1 m to 2 m. equipment and surfaces in direct contact with the patient should be cleaned before use for another patient (1,4,5) if the patient is likely to cause extensive environmental contamination, all horizontal or frequently touched surfaces should be cleaned before the room is used for another patient (1,4,5). patients should be examined and discharged as quickly as possible (1,2). a surgical or procedure mask should be worn but may not be as effective as a N95 mask. patients with suspected meningitis, pertussis, rubella, mumps, or meningococcal infection should be placed in an examining room. if this is not possible, separate the patient from other patients by 1 m to 2 m and keep the time spent in the waiting room to an absolute minimum. a gown should be worn when clothing will have direct contact with the patient. remove the gown before leaving the room (1,4\u20136) Perform hand hygiene using an antiseptic alcohol-based hand rinse or gel. equipment and surfaces in direct contact with the patient should be cleaned before use for another patient (1,4,58) airborne Precautions are recommended when performing aerosol-generating procedures. patients with suspected Ebola virus infections should not be managed in an office setting. all personnel should receive influenza vaccine annually (1,2,56) policies should be developed and implemented outlining work restrictions for personnel with communicable infections and measures to be taken to prevent transmission while working with an infection. personnel should not have direct contact with high-risk patients, should contain coughs and respiratory secretions using surgical or procedure masks and tissues. etic whitlow From direct patient care Until lesions dry Influenza From office Until symptoms resolve Measles From office Until 4 days after onset of rash Mumps From office Until 9 days after parotitis Pediculosis From office Until 5 days of appropriate antibiotic Rubella From office Until 7 days after onset of rash Scabies From direct patient care. nonanatomical medical waste includes 1\u20136: Liquid or semiliquid blood and blood products. items contaminated with blood that would release liquid or semiliquid blood if compressed. ventilation provides at least six air exchanges per hour in new or recently renovated premises. a telephone triage screening system is available and used appropriately. contact between children with contagious illnesses and other children is minimal. disinfectants or sterilization processes are used to reprocess equipment and instruments. examining tables are covered with disposable paper or a washable cloth. other surfaces in direct contact with the patient are cleaned between patients. visual alerts are posted at each entrance and at the reception desk. a telephone triage screening system is available and used appropriately. contact between children with contagious illnesses is minimal. rooms are cleaned daily and when visibly soiled. other office areas are cleaned at least weekly."}
