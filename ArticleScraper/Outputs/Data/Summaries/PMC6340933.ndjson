{"summary": "the long-term efficacy of vaccines is determined in large part by the generation of B and T cell memory (1, 2). Memory B cells defend against previously experienced pathogens by differentiation into antibody (Ab)-secreting plasma cells (PCs) however, certain pathogens drive functional changes in the Bmem compartment that may be age-dependent and contribute to chronic or recurrent infections (5, 6). Ag-activated nave B cells (NBC) via their MHC class II receptors and T cells via their T cell receptors (TCR) form stable interactions upon migrating to the borders of the B cell follicle and T cell zone respectively. B cells then proliferate and form the germinal center-dependent Bmem, GC-independent Bmem or differentiate into ab-secreting short-lived plasma cells (SLPC) mouse studies indicate that CD40 signaling via T cells can drive differentiation of GC-independent Bmem. these cells express Abs with fewer mutations and low affinity (13) no clear evidence from human studies supports a GC-independent path for the generation of human Bmem. mouse studies indicate that CD40 signaling via T cells can drive differentiation of GC-independent Bmem (12) cells express Abs with fewer mutations and low affinity (13) no clear evidence from human studies supports a GC-independent path for the generation of human Bmem. studies have shown the presence of somatically mutated IgM+ B cells. the GC-dependent origin of IgM+/IgD+ cells supports their characterization as Bmem. the peripheral blood IgM+/IgD+/CD27+ Bmem correspond to circulating splenic marginal zone B cells. class switch to express mainly IgG1, IgG2, or IgG3 and to a lesser extent IgG4. some examples include the importance of the polysaccharide-specific IgG2 response in protection against Streptococcus pneumoniae. a recent study showed that IgM+ Bmem shared gut-specific gene signatures with IgA+ Bmem, were related to some IgA+ clonotypes and could switch to IgA upon T-dependent or independent signals. the presence of IgE antibodies and their causal relationship with atopic diseases such as allergy and asthma is well established. chronic presence of Ag, aborted GC, extra-follicular differentiation may drive the expansion of a phenotypically and functionally altered Bmem subset. these atypical Bmem do not express CD27 and cannot be stimulated via their BCR to subsequently produce Ab. chronic immune stimulation and inflammation are thought to contribute to the expansion of atypical memory B cells in chronic infections. chronic immune stimulation and inflammation (Figure 2) are thought to contribute to the expansion of atypical Bmem that are unable to secrete Ab which could explain lack of acquisition of immunity against chronic infections. the peripheral blood IgM+/IgD+/CD27+ Bmem correspond to circulating splenic marginal zone B cells and contribute to protection against blood-borne T-independent pathogens. a vesicular stomatitis virus-Ebola vaccine generated a neutralizing IgM response that persisted despite administration of a booster vaccine. IgG+ Bmem cells express the IgG3 subclass (26, 27) this subpopulation is increased in the elderly and is hypothesized to represent an \u201cexhausted\u201d Bmem pool (28). this subpopulation is increased in the elderly and is hypothesized to represent an \u201cexhausted\u201d Bmem pool (28). antibody repertoire analysis of IgE+ B cells in patients with seasonal rhinitis demonstrated that the V gene usage was limited and similar across multiple patients. people with parasitic infections and patients with atopic dermatitis had less clonal diversity and lower frequency of SHM in their IgE repertoires than those with asthma. tonsils defined them as \u201ctissue-like\u201d Bmem. atypical FcRL4-expressing Bmem were also increased in frequency in patients with chronic HCV infection (44) and in those with active and latent TB infection (45). ation of previously functional Bmem may drive expansion of ATM (bottom right), or 4. Represent the end stage for Bmem dislodged from survival niches due to repeated bystander activation. combinatorial display libraries, B cell immortalization, single-cell expression cloning and hybridoma generation (51\u201353) each method has been used to improve our understanding of the Bmem repertoire. total blood lymphocytes or isolated IgG+ Bmem are typically cultured with EBV and CpG and/or additional co-stimulants for 1\u20132 weeks to allow proliferation of B cells. supernatants from the cultures are harvested to test for Ag-specific Ab after which the individual Ig H and L chain pairs are cloned and sequenced. plasmablasts sorted from human PBMC 1 week after vaccination against influenza, Bacillus anthracis and Streptococcus pneumoniae have successfully yielded Ag-specific and high affinity mAbs (52). a flow cytometry-based Ig capture assay was established to sort IgG+ Ag-specific plasmablasts for three vaccine Ags. the ability to accurately perform deep sequencing has provided valuable insights into the regulation and evolution of the Bmem repertoire. rapidly developing high-throughput next-generation sequencing technologies have achieved high resolution in the number of single chains that can be sequenced in one experiment. past 3 years alone has seen a rapid increase in the number of published resources for analysis of B-cell sequence data (Table 1). bioinformatics resources for analysis and comparison of B-cell antibody sequence diversity have been applied to Bmem subsets. mAbs are therapeutics for multi-drug resistant Gram negative bacteria. antibiotics are used for anthrax treatment and as post-exposure prophylaxis. the use of anthrax Vaccine adsorbed is restricted to military personnel and those who might face occupational anthrax exposure. tetani Clostridium tetani secretes tetanus toxin, which is responsible for the symptoms associated with tetanus disease. the incidence of reported tetanus cases in the united states declined by 98% from 0.39 per 100,000 population in 1947 to 0.01 per 100,000 population in 2016. the ab repertoire in response to vaccination with the 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine and the conjugate vaccine has been examined. full-length fully human serotype-specific mAbs and anti-cell wall polysaccharide mAbs generated from individuals 7 days post-vaccination were examined for their V gene usage. characterization of full-length fully human serotype-specific mAbs revealed a preferential use of lambda over kappa light chains in response to certain serotypes (117). emergence of S. pneumoniae serotypes not covered in the vaccine has driven the efforts to develop a \u201cuniversal\u201d vaccine that is not serotype-specific. a majority of the mAbs bound a specific 20 kDa region on the PA monomer, but their VH region sequence analysis revealed 64 unique gene rearrangements (102) mAbs demonstrated in vitro toxin neutralization and were protective in vivo following challenge of mice with bio-active anthrax toxin. tetanus-specific Ab repertoire has been characterized by several groups using different methods. TT+ serum IgG comprised 100 clonotypes, but only 3 clonotypes accounted for >40% of the response. 5% of plasmablast clonotypes account for the Abs detected in the serum 9 months post-vaccination. two studies identified IgG2 and IgA H chains matching the Ab isotype and response found in the donor sera. further characterization of the full-length fully human serotype-specific mAbs revealed a preferential use of lambda over kappa light chains in response to certain serotypes. the neutralizing IgG+ Abs produced by atypical Bmem in adults differ in their V region repertoire from Abs produced by classical Bmem (123). infant immune repertoires are poorly characterized and thought to be limited in their ability to respond to Ag challenge (124). study found no differences between classical and atypical Bmem repertoire (121). infant immune repertoires are poorly characterized and thought to be limited in their ability to respond to Ag challenge (124). high affinity human Abs have been cloned from IgG+ Ab-secreting cells 1 week after vaccination. the repertoire had limited clonality but an accumulation of somatic mutations within each clone, leading to extensive intraclonal diversity. evasion mechanisms employed by HIV include generating amino acid changes in the variable regions of the Env. chronically HIV-1-infected individuals develop anti-Env broadly neutralizing Abs. these Abs have increased SHM, activation-induced cytidine aminase-mediated insertions, deletions in the H or L chain sequences and long HCDR3s or self-reactivity. cross-reactive non-neutralizing Ab generated from a primary response forms Ag-Ab complexes upon secondary infection with a heterologous DENV serotype. the cross-reactive Ab binds Fc receptors allowing more efficient viral entry and replication in Fc-expressing cells resulting in an exacerbated disease. the deNV surface glycoprotein E, the main target for neutralizing Abs, contains regions that are highly conserved between DENV and the re-emerging Zika virus. the mAbs generated from plasmablasts of DENV-infected individuals cross-reacted with ZIKV-specific mAbs from Bmem of primary ZIKV-infected individuals with no history of DENV infection cross-reacted with DENV E proteins (151). three unrelated individuals were known to have BCRs cross-reactive to HA from group 1 and 2 influenza viruses (132) they characterized the clonal lineage and determined that germline receptors had the capacity to recognize epitopes on the head of the HA trimer of divergent Influenza subtypes (H1 and H3 subtype) the cross-reactive Abs bound both H1 and H3 with differing affinities. -specific single Bmem were sorted from macaques 14 days after immunization and VDJ sequences were examined to reveal 502 unique clonotypes and more than 600 functional sequences. atypical or exhausted Bmem identified in chronically HIV-infected individuals were demonstrated to have fewer SHM and lower HIV neutralization capacity than resting Bmem-derived mAbs. acute DENV infection results in a large and rapid virus-specific plasmablast response (144) mAbs derived from plasmablasts of patients with secondary DENV infection revealed a repertoire that was highly affinity matured and clonally expanded (145) mAbs also demonstrated cross-reactivity to DENV serotypes in binding and neutralization. Clostridioides difficile is the leading cause of nosocomial infections in industrialized nations. the existence of recurrent CDI poses a significant challenge to developing appropriate vaccines and therapeutics. immunization with CTD from the historical strains such as VPI10463 generates a robust recall response with neutralizing Abs that protect against lethal challenge. however, the anti-CTD Abs generated in immunized animal models do not cross neutralize toxin. a low serum concentration of anti-TcdA and \u2013TcdB Abs have been linked to recurrence. Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile) is the leading cause of nosocomial infections in industrialized nations. the existence of recurrent CDI poses a significant challenge to developing appropriate vaccines and therapeutics. studies have demonstrated anti-toxin circulating Ab and Bmem responses in certain individuals with C. difficile-associated diarrhea (157) and Bmem response to C-terminal domain fragment of TcdB in those with history of CDI (158). a low serum concentration of anti-TcdA and \u2013TcdB Abs have been linked to recurrence. there are no licensed vaccines or therapies available to prevent or treat CHIKV. the immune response to CHIKV infection is not fully understood. many studies have demonstrated the role of passive immunotherapy in controlling mAbs. rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic autoimmune disease that involves the production of anti-citrullinated protein Abs. rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic autoimmune disease that often involves the production of anti-citrullinated protein Abs. authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. conflict of interest Statement The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
