{"summary": "expression levels of 11 potential reference genes in avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) were determined by real-time PCR. the genes RPL30 (ribosomal protein L30) and SDHA (succinate dehydrogenase complex, subunit A) were the most stably expressed genes in the ALV-J infected CEF. the selection of reference genes should ideally be determined for each specific cell type and virus. chicken embryonic fibroblasts (CEF) are frequently used for propagation of ALV-J. those fibroblasts have also been used as model cells for the study of host-virus interaction. if RPL4 is excluded, V2/3 = 0.129 is a bit higher than V3/4, but still lower than cut-off value of 0.15. the optimal number of reference genes for normalization was determined by the geNorm software. Yin et al. compared the expression of 10 candidate reference genes in cell lines infected with 6 human viruses. found that ACTB is unsuitable as reference gene, whereas TATA-Box binding protein (TBP) and peptidyl-prolyl-isomerase A were stable genes for use as reference genes in expression studies. the protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee for animal experiments of Southwest University for Nationalities. the cells were seeded (approximately 5 106cells/well) in 24-well culture plates. after 1 h incubation, the cells were washed and further incubated in media with 2% FBS. housekeeping genes, previously used as references for the evaluation of expression stability in CEF infected with avian influenza virus, were also used as candidate reference genes in the present study. housekeeping genes, previously used as references for the evaluation of expression stability in CEF infected with avian influenza virus [11], were also used as candidate reference genes in the present study. gene expression stability measure (M value) is the mean pair-wise variation for a gene compared with that of all other tested candidate genes. gene expression stability measure (M value) is the mean pair-wise variation for a gene compared with that of all other tested candidate genes. the optimal number of reference genes required for accurate normalization was determined using geNorm by calculating the pairwise variation value Vn/n+1. a large variation means that the added gene has a significant effect. a large variation means that the added gene has a significant effect. cDNA products were treated with RNase H to remove remnants of RNA, and stored at-20\u00b0C until the time of real-time PCR testing. 11 housekeeping genes, previously used as references for the evaluation of expression stability in CEF infected with avian influenza virus [11], were also used as candidate reference genes in the present study. 20 l reaction volume consisted of 10 l SYBR\u00ae Premix Ex TaqTM, 2 l cDNA, 0.4 l ROX reference dye and 0.25 mM of each primer. gene expression stability measure (M value) is the mean pair-wise variation for a gene compared with that of all other tested candidate genes. highest M value allows the ranking of the remaining tested genes based on their increasing expression stability. candidate genes with the lowest M values have the most expression stability. the optimal number of reference genes required for accurate normalization was also determined using geNorm."}
