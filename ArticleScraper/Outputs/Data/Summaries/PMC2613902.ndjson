{"summary": "a municipal hospital in Taipei City was shut down for a month due to SARS. it became the designated SARS and infectious disease hospital for the city. the study collected the outpatient, inpatient and emergency service volumes for every year from April to March over four years. a municipal hospital in Taipei was shut down for a month due to SARS. it became the designated SARS and infectious disease hospital for the city. the hospital underwent a SARS outbreak during April 2003. the study follows the numbers of outpatients, emergency patients and inpatients from 2002 to 2006. the patient numbers for emergency and outpatient services were used as quantitative evaluations. the hospital was shut down during April 2003, and therefore the study collected the services volume from every April to next March. the organization of the healthcare system and its reimbursement still come from the Taiwan National Health Insurance (NHI) system. the neighborhood population of this hospital underwent no obvious change. however, the hospital was also now designated as an infectious disease hospital. the ARIMA IAR (2,1,0) model for the pre-SARS year was 6.94%. the MAPE for the year of SARS was 43.24%, improving to 10.58% for the 1st post-SARS year, and 6.20% for the 2nd post-SARS year. family medicine, metabolism and nephrology recovered during the year that SARS happened. family medicine was even higher than the base year during the first and second years after SARS. psychiatry was even higher than the base year during the second year. 131 Neurosurgery 545 207 355 159 * 626 49 611 59 Urology 1701 443 1028 446 * 1699 142 1807 132 Neurology 1900 117 1239 467 * 1877 160 1876 143 Plastic surgery 329 73 128 87 * 337 51 316 40 Cardiology 3723 748 2790 1091* 3699 286 3498 270 Dentist 852 516 462 198 * 638 83 790 16 p 0.05: significant less than the pre-SARS year (2002). p 0.05: significant higher than the pre-SARS year (2002). the hospital became the infectious disease designated hospital for the area. the outpatient service volume in this study shows a longer recovery period. there were also huge recovery differences between the different departments. family medicine, metabolism and nephrology departments have recovered quickly. ED visits only recovered during the second year after SARS [18,19]. non-critical ED visits may decrease more than critical patient visits [17,19]. a patient response to the emergency whole hospital shut down may have occurred. an adequate number of physicians are essential for the success of an infectious disease designated hospital. if an infectious disease designated hospital includes a certain subspecialty, the government only has to subside such a hospital during the year of the epidemic and the year after that. the members of Hoping Hospital, Taipei, were present during the SARS outbreak in 2003."}
