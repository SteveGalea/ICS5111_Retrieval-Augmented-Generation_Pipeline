{"summary": "a consensus on recommended procedures was achieved through periodic informal consultative meetings convened by WHO for discussions among subject-matter experts. a mixed approach is used to train multiple persons using standardized training curricula that allows time for practical work. laboratory results confirm geographic locations of poliovirus transmission and are used in planning of responsive immunization actions. in early phases of the GPEI, electronic data management systems and Internet were absent from many laboratories in resource-constrained settings. myelitis clinical case definition and performance targets caused significant increases in laboratory workloads. the GPLN responded with diverse approaches that included increasing staffing levels and testing supplies redistribution of specimens to other laboratories with capacity. changes in detections of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) and wild poliovirus between 1998 and 2016. the GPLN developed, evaluated, and implemented a real-time polymerase chain reaction procedure to routinely screen Sabin-related isolates to detect certain key mutations commonly found in VDPVs. a supplemental surveillance approach involves testing sewage samples collected from the environment or treatment plants. the results were routinely used for program monitoring and planning. approximately 10% of the AFP surveillance budget is spent on the GPLN. the expected value of surveillance information from the GPLN currently exceeds its costs. a consensus on recommended procedures was achieved through periodic informal consultative meetings convened by WHO. results analysis and interpretation, troubleshooting, reporting, and discussion of safety. two other training approaches are on-site training conducted by WHO staff or consultants. changes to AFP surveillance policies (eg, universal adoption of virological confirmation and discontinuing use of the poliomyelitis clinical case definition) caused significant increases in laboratory workloads. the GPLN responded with diverse approaches that included increasing staffing levels and testing supplies redistribution of specimens to other laboratories with capacity. poliomyelitis outbreak in hispaniola caused by circulation of VDPV type 1 viruses [8] caused further changes in the GPLN. a prior multiyear VDPV type 2 outbreak in Egypt was confirmed. the GPLN developed, evaluated, and implemented a real-time polymerase chain reaction procedure. approximately 10% of the AFP surveillance budget is spent on the GPLN. this highlights the fact that the expected value of surveillance information from the GPLN currently exceeds its costs. the GPLN opened an avenue for virologists and microbiologists worldwide to contribute more directly to the public health needs within and beyond their own communities. the western Pacific region has maintained sensitive poliovirus surveillance since certification in 2000 [14], as the risk of outbreaks from imported virus continues. the European Region, certified polio free in 2002 [19] has maintained high rates of vaccine coverage in Western and Central Europe, but coverage and integrated poliovirus surveillance declined as resources were redirected in some Central Asian and Eastern European countries. all GPLN laboratories are needed to help the GPEI safely navigate the polio endgame [23] the GPLN will continue to serve as a model for infectious disease laboratory networks. this is especially true for VPD networks, which support efforts to \u201cgo on offense\u201d against infectious diseases. many VPD laboratories and their supporting WHO coordinators are severely overstretched. the european region has maintained high rates of vaccine coverage in western and central Europe. but coverage and integrated poliovirus surveillance declined as resources were redirected in some central Asian and Eastern European countries. all GPLN laboratories are needed to help the GPEI safely navigate the polio endgame [23] the GPLN will continue to serve as a model for infectious disease laboratory networks. this is especially true for VPD networks, which support efforts to \u201cgo on offense\u201d against infectious diseases. further expansion of capacity will require additional investments in human as well as material resources. the GPLN has effectively demonstrated capacity to overcome weaknesses and threats. the high turnover rate of competent staff has always been compensated by regular training and integration of new staff. transitioning the GPLN assets toward other public health programs is an important part of the endgame strategic plan. a quick review of the ongoing consultations points toward different options for the future of the GPLN. main ones are evolution toward regional laboratory networks devoted to specific diseases, integration with existing global VPD laboratory networks, and transforming the GPLN to a core network. the GPLN should continue improvement efforts including finding sustainable mechanisms for national support, streamlining financial support to laboratories, and strengthening managerial skills at laboratory level. lessons learned from the GPLN should help foster interregional relationships under the global health security agenda framework. poliovirus evolution has allowed timely adaptation of molecular diagnostic procedures in 2015 to detect viruses belonging to new clusters or lineages. there is a need to sustain the services and contributions of polio laboratories through and beyond the process of global certification of poliomyelitis eradication. there is a need to sustain the services and contributions of polio laboratories. a successful transition of GPLN assets to support public health programs can be obtained only if clear and measurable objectives are established. the first is alignment across the GPEI partnership on the direction of the program after certification, which will provide a solid ground for a platform that includes retaining a postcertification surveillance capacity to sustain polio eradication. maintaining the fundraising capacity of the GPEI should be part of the global transition plan. the current strategic plan is completed (eg, diversification and strengthening of laboratory personnel\u2019s managerial skills, renewal of old equipment, and scale-up of effective modern communication and information systems). a phased transitioning strategy of GPLN assets should ensure that unfinished works in the current strategic plan are completed (eg, diversification and strengthening of laboratory personnel\u2019s managerial skills) the GPLN since its creation in 1989 has provided valuable support to the GPEI by ensuring timely and accurate data are available to orient both field surveillance and immunization activities. the GPLN is perceived as one valuable part of the GPEI to be leveraged, this article describes some of its achievements. development of a core capacity/platform will be the best trade-off to reconcile and manage expectations from GPEI\u2019s partners, other global public health initiatives, and WHO member states. this process will allow retention of skilled laboratory staff by engaging them in new areas of work, preserve the essential linkages between field and laboratory surveillance."}
