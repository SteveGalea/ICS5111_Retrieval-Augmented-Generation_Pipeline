{"summary": "the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) epidemic in south Korea has been the largest mass outbreak of MERS-CoV outside the Arabian Peninsula. a large number of MERS-CoV cases arose in a short period of time in Korea, where the camels that serve as host of MERS-CoV do not live. the national quarantine system was revealed to have had an inadequate initial response. the recent MERS-CoV outbreak in Korea can be declared a typical public health crisis. this is a situation in which the scale, duration, and predictability of a crisis cannot be managed by the present healthcare resources. this paper aims to systematically present the institutional and structural factors from which the MERS-CoV outbreak arose. 68-year-old man had returned from travelling in the middle east from the end of April to the beginning of may, 2015. he transmitted MERS-CoV to a total of 26 people including healthcare professionals. the public health authorities, who had never experienced MERS-CoV, revealed their incompetence in their initial response. the transmission of MERS-CoV mediated by Samsung Medical Center in Seoul could have been due to the structural problem of the emergency rooms of the main hospitals in Korea. many family members and acquaintances visit hospital and emergency room patients because of the cultural traditions of visiting the sick and of family members assisting with nursing care. the new infectious disease invaded this healthcare environment that was lacking in the appropriate infection control capabilities, which led to the public health crisis. the manual may be a necessary method of preparation, but is not a sufficient condition for an effective response. the preparation for a public health crisis should encompass all crisis preparation procedures related to the means of prevention, reduction of hazards on site, and rapid recovery. the lack of coordination could be viewed as the greatest disappointment in the unfolding of the MERS-CoV outbreak in Korea. the lack of coordination could be viewed as the greatest disappointment in the unfolding of the MERS-CoV outbreak in Korea. the KCDC must follow orders from administration officials in the Ministry of Health and Welfare. it is very difficult for a subordinate organization to receive the manpower and funding it needs for independent crisis preparation and response. identifying an organization\u2019s roles and functions in preparation for a public health crisis is also important. a critical review of preparations should be conducted based on lessons learned from the controversy during the MERS-CoV crisis. a professional response team should be formed and trained for each type of disaster with clear and distinct roles for team members. a professional response team should be formed and trained for each type of disaster. the public health authorities, who had never experienced MERS-CoV, revealed their incompetence in their initial response. they failed to establish the initial range of isolation by mechanically applying the standards stated in the WHO guideline [7], which stated that the virus is usually transmitted within 2 meters of contact with the patient. this revealed their insufficient knowledge and misjudgment of MERS-CoV. the transmission of MERS-CoV mediated by Samsung Medical Center in Seoul could have been due to the structural problem of the emergency rooms of the main hospitals in Korea. a large number of patients beyond the actual caring capacity visit the emergency rooms and end up spending a long time in a crowded emergency room exposed to infectious diseases. the new infectious disease invaded this healthcare environment that was lacking in the appropriate infection control capabilities, which led to the public health crisis. the manual may be a necessary method of preparation, but is not a sufficient condition for an effective response. the preparation for a public health crisis should encompass all crisis preparation procedures related to the means of prevention, reduction of hazards on site, and rapid recovery. the lack of coordination could be viewed as the greatest disappointment in the unfolding of the MERS-CoV outbreak in Korea. the existence of a MERS-CoV preparation manual and the validity of its contents are not key indicators of the nation\u2019s level of preparation for a public health crisis. the establishment of an independent governmental agency is of utmost importance. identifying an organization\u2019s roles and functions in preparation for a public health crisis is also important. the starting point of preparing for a public health crisis should be identifying the characteristics of and the community\u2019s vulnerability to a specific disaster. a critical review of preparations should be conducted based on lessons learned from the controversy surrounding the organization and role of the rapid response team. a professional response team should be formed and trained for each type of disaster with clear and distinct roles for team members. these individuals must strengthen their ability to carry out immediate on-site responses through repeated training during ordinary times. a structure in which the KCDC must follow orders from administration officials in the Ministry of Health and Welfare. it is very difficult for a subordinate organization to receive the manpower and funding it needs for independent crisis preparation and response. identifying an organization\u2019s roles and functions in preparation for a public health crisis is also important. a critical review of preparations should be conducted based on lessons learned from the controversy during the MERS-CoV crisis. a professional response team should be formed and trained for each type of disaster with clear and distinct roles for team members. a professional response team should be formed and trained for each type of disaster. the government should recognize that a society that values the health of the public highly is a truly advanced society. the government should spare no social investment in prioritizing reform of the outdated healthcare system as a core national policy."}
