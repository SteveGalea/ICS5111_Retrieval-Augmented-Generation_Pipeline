{"summary": "two novel viruses, Malsoor virus (family Bunyaviridae, genus, Phlebovirus) and a novel adenovirus (family, Adenoviridae genus, Mastadenovirus) were identified from Rousettus bats in the Maharashtra State of India. this study was done to develop and optimize real time reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays. RNA was extracted from 140 l of tissue culture grown (VeroCCL81 cells) Malsoor virus stock using a QIAamp viral RNA kit. both RNA and DNA were stored at 20\u00b0C until further use. primers and probes were custom designed using OLIGO Calc Oligonucleotide properties calculator software. first reverse transcription was carried out at 50\u00b0C for 30 min, 94\u00b0C for two minutes followed by 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 15 sec, 49\u00b0C for 30 sec, 68\u00b0C for five minutes. Nested PCR was carried out using primers (NIntF227 and NIntR541). first PCR cycle was denaturation at 94\u00b0C for five minutes. followed by 35 cycles of oneminutes steps at 94, 55 and 72\u00b0C each. thermal cycling conditions for malsoor real-time RT-PCR were 50\u00b0C for 30 min, 95\u00b0C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 sec and 52\u00b0C for one minute. qPCR assay was optimized for adenovirus using same reagents and specific primers and probes. the desired PCR product was purified using QIAquick column extraction kit. the synthesized RNA was treated with DNAse I (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) the RNA was purified using Tripure reagent (Roche, USA) and eluted in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. real-time RT-PCR of malsoor virus was performed using dengue 2, chikungunya and Ingwavuma viral RNA along with positive controls of PS, RD, BHK21, Bat embryo cell line and Vero E-6 cells. nested PCR was designed to amplify 314 bp of nucleoprotein gene. nested RT-PCR for adenovirus was standardized at primer concentration of 15 pmole, MgSO4 at 1.3 mM concentration and annealing temperature at 56\u00b0C. forward and reverse sequences generated were aligned to make a consensus sequence. sequence generated from first PCR productfor polymerase gene was submitted to the NCBI databank. RNA diluted serially was used to determine sensitivity of real-time RT-PCR. RT-PCR was sensitive up to 107 dilution i.e., 100 copies of RNA. RT-PCR was sensitive up to 108 dilution i.e., 10 copies of RNA. the primers designed for RT-PCR and real-time PCR showed specific amplification for Malsoor virus and adenovirus. nested RT-PCR and real-time PCR were highly specific and could distinguish Malsoor virus from other dengue, chikungunya and Ingwavuma viral RNAs. s and was found to be close to heartland and severe fever with thromocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) viruses12. antibody against severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus (SARS-CoV)-like viruses from bat was also detected in R. leschenaulti, suggesting that these bats also may support infection with SARS-CoV-like viruses."}
