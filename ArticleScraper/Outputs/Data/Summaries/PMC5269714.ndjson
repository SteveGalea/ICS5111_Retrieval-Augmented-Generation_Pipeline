{"summary": "438 patients recruited from January to December 2013, including 147 community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) inpatients. the URTI outpatients ranged from 18 to 92 years old. a total of 169 (38.6%) patients tested positive for at least one respiratory pathogen via multiplex real-time PCR. in the CAP patients, there were four cases of HRV-A21 and two of A68. the rest of the genotypes were one case each of A2, A9, A13, A33, A53, A53, B35, B48, B84, and C un-typed. seven samples of HRV-A in the URTI patients could not be genotyped precisely. the detection rate of HRV-A21 was higher in the severe CAP patients (7.9%, n = 3) than in the non-severe CAP patients (7.9%, n = 3). the nt and aa sequence identities of VP1 were 99.0\u201399.7%. the amino acid (aa) sequence identities of VP1 were 90.4\u201392.1% and 94.7\u201396.5% respectively. a total of 12 specific aa substitutions were observed in the HRV-A21 strains in this study. no specific substitutions were found in the BC or DE loops of the VP1 region and other coding gene regions. the median age of HRV-A21-positive CAP patients was older than that of the five URTI outpatients. three CAP patients and two URTI patients positive for HRV-A21 had leukocytosis with neutrophilia, and others showed leukopenia at presentation. 1.8 107 RMH001 35 M Severe CAP 6 Apr 2013 38.6 Fever, cough, dyspnea 8.6 95.5 08 Apr 201310 Apr 2013 Tracheal aspirate 2.8 108 RMH97 68 F CAP 12 Jul 2013 40 Fever, cough, sputum 19.72 91.3 23 Jul 2013 BALF 2.1 107 PUMCH13351 21 F URTI 19 Feb 2013 38.5 Fever, cough, sputum, sore throat, two of these three patients (coding RMH123 and RMH114) died 26 and 23 days after the onset of illness. both fatal cases had underlying diseases; one had cerebrovascular disease and the other had Parkinson\u2019s disease. otide polymorphisms (SNPs), including 24 nonsynonymous mutations, were located in the VP1, VP2, VP3, 3C, and 3D gene regions. aa site E841 was the specific site mutation in all the HRV-A21 strains identified in this study. reads that mapped to known pathogens were also found but at lower level. the URTI outpatients ranged from 18 to 92 years old. the CAP outpatients ranged from 18 to 84 years old. a total of 169 (38.6%) patients tested positive for at least one respiratory pathogen via multiplex real-time PCR. in the URTI patients, there were four cases of HRV-A21 and two of A68. the rest of the genotypes were one case each of A2, A9, A13, A33, A53, B35, B48, B84, and C un-typed. the detection rate of HRV-A21 was higher in the severe CAP patients (7.9%,. prevalence of HRV-A21 correlates with a spectrum of illness from mild URTIs to severe CAP. unexpectedly, HRV-A21 was most frequency (9 of 42, 21.4%) detected as the only pathogen present in an infection among the identified HRV genotypes. compared to the reference sequences were 90.4\u201392.1% and 94.7\u201396.5% respectively. phylogenic trees of the genomes and viral protein gene gene (VP) 1 sequences were constructed using the neighbor-joining method. a total of 12 specific aa substitutions were observed in the HRV-A21 strains in this study. no specific substitutions were found in the BC or DE loops of the VP1 region. three CAP patients and two URTI patients positive for HRV-A21 had leukocytosis with neutrophilia. the viral loads of HRV-A21 in the respiratory samples ranged from 3.7 104 to 2.8 108 copies/ml. no significant differences were observed between the CAP inpatientsand outpatients. 68 F CAP 12 Jul 2013 40 Fever, cough, sputum 19.72 91.3 23 Jul 2013 BALF 2.1 107 PUMCH13351 21 F URTI 19 Feb 2013 38.5 Fever, cough, sputum, sore throat, runny nose 15 72.9 26 Feb 2013 Nasal and throat swabs, serum 1.3 106 PUMCH13364 27 M URTI 1 Apr 2013 38.4 Fever, cough, sputum, sore throat both fatal cases had underlying diseases; one had cerebrovascular disease and the other had Parkinson\u2019s disease. the other HRV-A21-positive patients recovered. metagenomic analysis of microbial species in HRV-A21-positive patients. alleles in serial RMH123 viral strains, 3135 (aa 841 in VP1 from E to K) and 5740 (aa 1709 in 3D from C to Y) no specific site mutations were found in sequences obtained from RMH123 and RMH144, the two dead cases. reads that mapped to known pathogens were also found but at lower level. the HRV-A21 detected in this study was distinct from the only three strains of HRV previously identified by phylogenic analysis. one isolate obtained in this study could not be neutralized by the antiserum against the prototype strain. the HSV-1 reads were identified in the respiratory samples from two patients. however, when compared to those of HRV-A21, they were not the dominant species. the role of these infections in the severity of pneumonia should be investigated in future studies. the emergent EV-D68 that circulated in the u.s. in 2014 contained mutant genomic sequences, which could have been responsible for the outbreak and increased disease severity4,19. the VP1 BC and DE loops, the VP2 EF loop, and the VP3 knob regions are known to form the major neutralization sites in picornaviruses. we also found the switches between minor and major alleles in serially collected HRV strains of RMH123, a dead case. the fact that several HRV variants co-circulate in the population indicates a need for precise genotyping of HRV infections. criteria included age of at least 18 years, with respiratory symptoms, chest roentgenogram, and computed tomography confirmed pneumonia25. tracheal aspirate specimens and sera were collected from each inpatient when clinically indicated. HRV genotyping, load quantification, and phylogenic analysis Conventional reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) targeting the 5\u2032-untranslated region (UTR)/viral protein (VP) gene 4 and the VP4/VP2 region was used for HRV screening and genotyping as described elsewhere27,28,29. genomes were determined by phylogenic analysis using amplified gene sequences compared to reference HRV genotype sequence deposited in GenBank. the taxonomic assignment was performed using MEGAN software (version 5.2.3) with the parameters \"Min Support 50, Min score 80, Top percent 10\" 31. all reads assigned to the Enterovirus genus were retrieved and aligned to the consensus sequence of the reference strain, HRV-A21_p1177_sR3307_2010. the human cervical carcinoma cell line was isolated at 33 \u00b0C. a neutralization assay was carried out by using the reference antiserum against the prototype HRV-A21 strain (ATCC VR-1131 AS/GP) and the HRV-A21 isolate. URTI patients recruited by the national respiratory virus surveillance project. inclusion criteria included at least 18 years of age, acute fever (body temperature 38.0 \u00b0C), respiratory symptoms without radiological pulmonary abnormalities. CAP was diagnosed following the guidelines of the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society. human coronaviruses (HCoV, OC43, 229E, NL63, and HKU1), parainfluenza viruses, human metapneumovirus (A and B), EV, RSV (A and B), adenovirus, bocavirus, parechovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae B, and Staphylococc the samples were treated with a type 318 chip (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc, USA) the samples were treated with Turbo DNase (Life Technologies, USA) and RNAse One (Promega, USA) to decrease the host genome background according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. PCR was performed using 94 \u00b0C for 5 min, 40 cycles of amplification at 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, 50 \u00b0C for 45 s, and 72 \u00b0C for 90 s. the whole genome and viral protein genes were used to construct phylogenetic trees in MEGA 5.1 using the neighbor-joining method. HRV-A21 genomes obtained are KM576764 to KM576767, KR871674 to KR871677, and KR090587. Statistical analyses Pearson\u2019s Chi square tests or Fisher\u2019s exact tests were used for categorical variables."}
