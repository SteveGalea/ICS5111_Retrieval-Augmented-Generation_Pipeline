{"summary": "the family Arteriviridae within the order Nidovirales initially included four positive-stranded RNA viruses. this included porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), mouse lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV), equine arteritis virus (EAV), and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV) the two genotypes of PRRSV currently belong to two different species (PRRSV-1 and viruses found in nature have not been implicated in epizootics. these viruses include debrazza\u2019s monkey virus 1 (DeBMV-1) in de Brazza\u2019s monkeys (Cercopithecus neglectus), Drakensberg Mountain vervet virus (DMVV-1) in vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus pygerythrus) and KKCBV in Kinda baboons (Papio kindae). arterivirus genomes vary in length between 12.5 and 15.5 kb and contain 10 to 15 known ORFs. all but two are located toward the 3\u2032 end of the genome and encode viral structural proteins that are cleaved by viral or host proteases. a papain-like protease (PLP2) domain situated in the N terminus of nsp2 and a serine protease domain residing in nsp4. the rapid release of nsp1, nsp1, and nsp2 from the N terminus of the polyprotein is mediated by autocatalytic cleavage with PLP1 (between nsp1 and nsp1 [nsp1/1]), the 2 PRF generates a transframe (TF) fusion protein, nsp2TF. it consists of the N-terminal two-thirds of nsp2, followed by a unique C-terminal domain. at the same frameshifting site, an immediate stop codon is generated by 1 PRF, which leads to the expression of a truncated nsp2N. replicase subunit nsp1 functions as a transactivator for both 2 and 1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) RNA signals and nsp1s of arteriviruses were identified in all simarteriviruses. the slippery sequence and C-rich motif of the PRF signal were identified in all simarteriviruses. signals identified in the nsp2 coding region of arteriviruses. for each sequence, the genome coordinate of the first amino acid in the alignment is specified. for each sequence, the nsp1 or nsp1 coordinate of the first amino acid in the alignment is specified. the highly conserved motif in PRRSV-2 nsp1 is also found in all known arteriviruses except WPDV and EAV. the long distance between slippery sequence and C-rich sequence in WPDV suggests that WPDV likely does not utilize frameshifting. 2/1 PRF is used to translate nsp2TF and nsp2N proteins in non-EAV/-WPDV arteriviruses. we initially characterized nsp2-related proteins in SHFV-infected MARC-145 cells. the nsp2 gene is predicted to be nucleotides 1649 to 3901 of the SHFV genome. nsp2TF is translated from SHFV genomic nucleotides 1649 to 2860 fused to nucleotides 2859 to 3536. nsp2N is translated from SHFV genomic nucleotides 1649 to 2860 fused to nucleotides 2859 to 3093, resulting in a product with a nsp2TF (nt 1649 to 2860 + 2859 to 3536) and nsp2N (nt 1649 to 2860 + 2859 to 3536) are translated through 2 PRF and 1 PRF respectively. the epitopes recognized by antibodies are indicated by black arrows. the top three largest proteins appear to be nsp2, nsp2TF, and nsp2N. the top three largest proteins appear to be nsp2, nsp2TF, and nsp2N. the second large protein band was specific to nsp2TF via 2 PRF. in HEK-293T cells transfected with plasmids expressing nsp2 and nsp2N, both PRF products, nsp2TF and nsp2N, were not detected. these results indicate that SHFV nsp1 is critical for the expression of nsp2TF and nsp2N. HEK-293T cells were cotransfected with a plasmid expressing HA-tagged SHFV nsp2 and a plasmid expressing FLAG-tagged SHFV nsp1 or mutants thereof. nsp2TF and nsp2N were not detected in HEK-293T cells expressing PRRSV nsp1 mutants that contained the corresponding alanine substitution at Y125 (PRRS nsp2TF was also recognized by rabbit pAb against the nsp2TF C-terminal peptide (nsp2TFC) the expression of nsp2 nsp1 and mutants thereof was evaluated with mAb 76. a dual luciferase reporter system was employed to confirm the activity of SHFV nsp1 in stimulating 2/1 PRF at the predicted PRF signal in the SHFV genome. a dual luciferase reporter system was generated using the approach that we described previously. SHFV nsp1 stimulates 2/1 PRF in pDluc reporter systems. 2FS and 1FS products containing Renilla luciferase (Rluc) could be translated via 2 PRF and 1 PRF. nonframeshift, 1 PRF, and 2 PRF products were detected by Western blotting using anti-Renilla luciferase (Rluc) mAb. products generated without frameshifting or from 1 or 2 PRF are indicated as stop, 1FS, and 2FS respectively. predicted masses of stop, 1FS, and 2FS products are 40.4 kDa, 43.4 kDa, and 70.8 kDa. in vitro translation was performed with only reporter mRNA from pDluc-SHFV/WT, the 2FS product was not detected and only a trace amount of 1FS was observed. nsp2TF was not detected and only a low expression level of nsp2N was detected. both the slippery sequence and C-rich motif are required for efficient 2/1 PRF in simian arteriviruses. however, four types of slippery sequence were observed in simarteriviruses. mRNAs transcribed from pDluc-SHFV/SS1 or pDluc-SHFV/SS2 constructs only generated stop and 2FS products in presence of SHFV nsp1. mRNAs transcribed from pDluc-SHFV/SS1 or pDluc-SHFV/SS2 constructs only generated stop and 2FS products. HEK-293T cells were cotransfected with pDluc-SHFV/WT or mutants thereof and a plasmid expressing SHFV nsp1; empty vector (EV) was used as a control. nonframeshift, 1 PRF, and 2 PRF products were detected by Western blotting using anti-Renilla luciferase (Rluc) mAb. vSS1, vSS2, and vCC1 were harvested at 36 hpi. the nsp2-related products were detected by anti-PLP2 mAb 134-260. the nsp2TF was also detected by rabbit pAb against the nsp2TF peptide (nsp2TFC) pDluc-SHFV/CC1 and the plasmid expressing SHFV nsp1 were cotransfected with pDluc-SHFV/CC1 and the plasmid expressing SHFV nsp1. no frameshifting products were detected in in vitro translation reactions using the reporter mRNAs transcribed from the pDluc-SHFV/CC1 construct. poly(rC) binding proteins (PCBPs) were demonstrated to be critical for 2/1 PRF in PRRSV. in vitro translations were performed with mRNA and the addition of nsp1 and/or PCBP2 in wheat germ extract. in vitro translation using RRL was included as the control. the interaction between PCBPs and PRRSV-1 nsp1 was determined to be required for nsp1\u2019s ability to bind the PRRSV-1 2/1 PRF RNA signal (35). in HEK-293T cells transfected with plasmids expressing FLAG-tagged SHFV nsp1 and PCBP2, the protein complex of nsp1 and PCBP2 was immunoprecipitated by anti-FLAG mAb. HEK-293T cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing FLAG-tagged SHFV nsp1 or empty vector. interaction between nsp1 and PCBP2 was determined by immunoprecipitation (IP) using anti-FLAG M2 antibody and Western blot analysis using antibodies against PCBP1/2. vY111A, vR114A, and vCC1 attenuated viral growth in MARC-145 cells. vSS1 and vSS2 showed growth kinetics similar to that of WT virus. vSS1 and vR114A mutants developed smaller plaques than those caused by WT virus. the genomes of most arteriviruses share a highly conserved RNA-binding motif in nsp1. in vitro translation was performed with reporter mRNA of SHFV and nsp1 protein of PRRSV-1. in vitro translation of mRNA from plasmid pDluc-PRRSV/WT in the presence of SHFV nsp1 (1 M), different concentrations of PRRSV nsp1 (from 0.5 M to 1.5 M), or dilution buffer (DB). products generated without PRF or from 1 or 2 PRF are indicated as stop, 1FS, and 2FS, respectively. the 2FS product was detected in HEK-293T cells transfected with pDluc-SHFV/WT and a plasmid expressing nsp1 from arteriviruses of other species, including KRCV-1, PRRSV-1, PRRSV-2, and LDV. the 2FS product was detected; however, the 1FS product was not observed, which may be due to the low efficiency of 1 PRF. the PRRSV replicase subunit nsp1 functions as a transactivator for both 2 and 1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) a highly conserved -helix motif in nsp1 is critical for PRF transactivation (34). the slippery sequence and C-rich motif of the PRF signal were identified in all simarteriviruses. a highly conserved -helix motif in the papain-like cysteine protease domain (PCP) of arterivirus nsp1s was predicted. the protein sequences of arterivirus nsp1s were predicted as described previously. the highly conserved motif in PRRSV-2 nsp1 is also found in all known arteriviruses except WPDV and EAV. the long distance between slippery sequence and C-rich sequence in WPDV suggests that WPDV likely does not utilize frameshifting at this site. 2/1 PRF is used to translate nsp2TF and nsp2N proteins in non-EAV/-WPDV arteriviruses. we initially characterized nsp2-related proteins in SHFV-infected MARC-145 cells. the nsp2 gene is predicted to be nucleotides 1649 to 3901 of the SHFV genome. nsp2TF is translated from SHFV genomic nucleotides 1649 to 2860 fused to nucleotides 2859 to 3536. nsp2N is translated from SHFV genomic nucleotides 1649 to 2860 fused to nucleotides 2859 to 3093, resulting in a product with a p2 is encoded by the SHFV genomic region, comprising nucleotides (nt 1649 to 3901), nsp2TF (nt 1649 to 2860 + 2859 to 3536) and nsp2N (nt 1649 to 2860 + 2859 to 3536) are translated through 2 PRF and 1 PRF respectively. epitopes recognized by antibodies are indicated by black arrows. the top three largest proteins appear to be nsp2, nsp2TF, and nsp2N. the top band appeared to be a cellular protein, since this band was also detected in mock-infected cells. the second large protein band was specific to nsp2TF via 2 PRF. in HEK-293T cells transfected with plasmids expressing nsp2 and nsp2N, both PRF products, nsp2TF and nsp2N, were not detected. these results indicate that SHFV nsp1 is critical for the expression of nsp2TF and nsp2N. amino acids Gly109, Lys110, Tyr111, Arg114, and Arg115 in the conserve nsp2TF and nsp2N were not detectable in HEK-293T cells expressing PRRSV nsp1 mutants that contained the corresponding alanine substitution at Y125 (PRRSV-2) or Y131 (PRRSV-1) similar to the R115A mutant, a lower expression level was observed for the SHFV Y111A mutant. however, this lower expression should not be the direct reason leading to the loss of expression of the expression of nsp2TF was further confirmed by IP using anti-HA mAb and WB detection using anti-nsp2TF C-terminal peptide pAb (anti-TFC). the expression of nsp2TF was also recognized by rabbit pAb against the nsp2TF C-terminal peptide (nsp2TFC). a dual luciferase reporter system was employed to confirm the activity of SHFV nsp1 in stimulating 2/1 PRF at the predicted PRF signal in the SHFV genome. a dual luciferase reporter system was generated using the approach that we described previously. SHFV nsp1 stimulates 2/1 PRF in pDluc reporter systems. 2FS and 1FS products containing Renilla luciferase could be translated via 2 PRF and 1 PRF. plasmid pDluc-SHFV/WT containing wild-type SHFV 2/1 PRF signal and a plasmid expressing mutants thereof; empty vector (EV) was used as the control. nonframeshift, 1 PRF, and 2 PRF products were detected by Western blotting using anti-Renilla luciferase (Rluc) mAb. the predicted masses of stop, 1FS, and 2FS products are 40.4 kDa, 43.4 kDa, and 70.8 kDa. in vitro translation was performed with only reporter mRNA from pDluc-SHFV/WT. the 2FS product was not detected and only a trace amount of 1FS was observed. nsp2TF was not detected and only a low expression level of nsp2N was detected. the slippery sequence and C-rich motif are required for efficient 2/1 PRF in simian arteriviruses. however, four types of slippery sequence were observed in simarteriviruses of different species. mRNAs transcribed from pDluc-SHFV/SS1 or pDluc-SHFV/SS2 constructs only generated stop and 2FS products in presence of SHFV nsp1. mRNAs transcribed from pDluc-SHFV/SS1 or pDluc-SHFV/SS2 constructs and translated in RRL only generated stop and 2FS products. HEK-293T cells were cotransfected with pDluc-SHFV/WT or mutants thereof. a plasmid expressing SHFV nsp1; empty vector (EV) was used as a control. nonframeshift, 1 PRF, and 2 PRF products were detected by Western blotting. cells were infected with SHFV or mutants (vSS1, vSS2, and vCC1) at an MOI of 0.01, and cell lysates were harvested at 36 hpi. nsp2TF was also detected by rabbit pAb against the nsp2TF C-terminal peptide (nsp2TFC) HEK-293T cells were cotransfected with pDluc-SHFV/CC1 and the plasmid expressing SHFV nsp1. no frameshifting products were detected in in vitro translation reactions. this result was further confirmed by in vitro translation assay using RRL. poly(rC) binding proteins (PCBP2) enhances SHFV 2/1 PRF in simarteriviruses. in vitro translations were performed with mRNA and the addition of nsp1 and/or PCBP2 in wheat germ extract (WGE) mRNA from plasmid pDluc-SHFV/WT in wheat germ extract is shown as a control. products generated without frameshifting or from 1 or 2 PRF are indicated as stop, 1FS, and 2FS respectively. bars and error bars show mean values and standard errors of the means. HEK-293T cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing FLAG-tagged SHFV nsp1 or empty vector. interaction between nsp1 and PCBP2 was determined by immunoprecipitation (IP) using anti-FLAG M2 antibody and Western blot (WB) analysis using antibodies against PCBP1/2. growth kinetics analysis showed vY111A, vR114A, and vCC1 attenuated viral growth in MARC-145 cells. vSS1 and vSS2 displayed growth kinetics similar to that of WT virus. vSS1 and vSS2 showed growth kinetics similar to that of vCC1. morphologies of WT SHFV and mutants thereof were detected. nsp1s stimulate ribosomal frameshifting on the SHFV 2/1 PRF signal. nsp1s stimulate 2/1 PRF at signals of divergent arteriviruses. in vitro translation of mRNA from plasmid pDluc-SHFV/WT. products generated without PRF or from 1 or 2 PRF are indicated as stop, 1FS, and 2FS. the 2FS product was detected in HEK-293T cells transfected with pDluc-SHFV/WT and a plasmid expressing nsp1 from arteriviruses of other species, including KRCV-1, PRRSV-1, PRRSV-2, and LDV. no frameshifting product was detected in cells expressing nsp1. PBJV, SHEV, and SHFV are known etiologic agents of almost uniformly lethal viral hemorrhagic fever in macaques (8). the arterivirus 2/1 PRF and the involvement of a transactivating viral protein and host factors are unprecedented in eukaryotic systems. the distance between the slippery sequence and downstream C-rich RNA motif is consistently 9 or 10 nt in all non-EAV arteriviruses. a 2/1 PRF mechanism similar to that used by PRRSV is employed by simarteriviruses to express nsp2TF and/or nsp2N analogs. nsp2TF plays an important role in SHFV replication. three variants of the G_GUU_UUU slippery sequence were identified in simarteriviruses, namely, U_GUU_UU (DeMAV, KRTGV-1, and PBJV), G_GUC_UCU (KKCBV, KRCV-1, KRCV-2, and MYBV-1), and U_UUC_UCU (FSVV, SHEV, and ZMbV-1). PRRSV nsp1 transactivates ribosomal frameshifting through a highly conserved -helix motif. arginine (Arg128 in PRRSV-2 and Arg134 in PRRSV-1) is a key residue for nsp1 activity. nsp1 stimulates 2/1 PRF to express nsp2TF and nsp2N. an alanine substitution at Arg114 completely impairs this process the amino acid sequence identities of nsp1s among these arteriviruses range from 21.4% to 57.7%. but in silico structure prediction, all arteriviral nsp1s share a similar 3-D structure. the conserved -helix motif is also found in these predicted structures. supplementation with PCPB1 led preferentially to 2 PRF in mammalian cells. this finding suggests that PCBP1 is the abundant form in RRL. human embryonic kidney 293T cells (HEK-293T; ATCC CRL-3216) were used for ectopic protein expression. these cells were maintained in minimum essential medium (MEM); supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) mutants were cloned into pGEX-6p-2 vector for expression as glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged proteins. predicted nsp1 gene sequence of KRCV-1 was cloned into p3xFLAG-Myc-CMV-24 expression vector (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) a dual luciferase reporter plasmid, pDluc (51), was used for evaluation of in vitro programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) efficiencies. the pDluc-SHFV/WT plasmid containing 2/1 PRF signals of PRRSV-1 was described in our previous study. specific anti-nsp1 and anti-nsp2 mAbs were obtained by screening with an immunofluorescence assay. mAbs 133-243 and 134-260 against the SHFV nsp2 N-terminal PLP2 domain and mAb 76-69 against SHFV nsp1 were used in this study. his-tagged nsp1 and the PLP2 domain of nsp2 were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS. proteins were dialyzed, quantified with the Pierce bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit. without methionine (Promega, Madison, WI), 0.2 MBq [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA), proteins were separated in 12% SDS-PAGE gels. the protein gels were dried and exposed to X-ray film or to a Cyclone plus storage phosphor screen. at 36 h posttransfection, cell lysates were harvested with 300 l of IP lysis wash buffer per well. for the SHFV infection system, MARC-145 cells seeded in 6-well plates were infected with the parental virus or mutants thereof at a multiplicity of infection. HEK-293T cells seeded in 6-cm dishes were transfected with plasmid DNA expressing SHFV nsp1. an empty vector was included as a control. at 36 hpt, cell lysates were harvested with 500 l of IP lysis wash buffer per well. cDNA clones containing mutations at the region of nsp1 or the 2/1 PRF signal were created using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. recombinant viruses were serially passaged 5 times on MARC-145 cells. a plaque assay was performed in MARC-145 cells using the method described previously (33).
