{"summary": "the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an emerging virus that causes severe enteric disease in pigs (2). the virus is transmitted via the oral-fecal route and replicates in the mature enterocytes of the intestinal epithelium (3). the rate of mortality in neonatal piglets is high (4, 5). piglets obtain passive lactogenic immunity through the continuous supply of antibodies present in colostrum and milk. IgA antibodies are particularly considered to be important in providing lactogenic immunity because of their relative resistance to proteolytic cleavage. the role of APN as a receptor for PEDV is controversial. PEDV has been reported to utilize APN as a functional cellular receptor (18\u201322) via its S1B domain (23), but its actual functioning as a receptor is currently disputed. all S1 variants were C-terminally tagged with the Fc part of human IgG1 or mouse IgG2a. a compilation of coomassie blue-stained protein gels is shown. limited data on the immunogenicity of the PEDV spike protein are available. mouse monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were generated to map epitopes of the antibodies to one of the domains within the S1 subunit. all monoclonal antibodies appeared to be of the IgG1 isotype, with the exception of MAb 71. reactivity of monoclonal antibodies to these constructs was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) antibody binding to human Fc-tagged S1 variants coated onto 96-well plates was tested by ELISA. epitopes of the 10 S1-specific MAbs were mapped to S1 domains 0, A, B, and CD. competition in binding between antibodies was investigated using biolayer interferometry. biosensors coated with the S1-Fc protein were exposed to one antibody until saturation was achieved, followed by exposure to a second antibody. antibody binding was detected by changes in the light interference pattern. monoclonal antibodies segregated into six nonoverlapping epitope classes within PEDV S1. MAbs share an epitope region are aligned vertically. cross-reactivity of S1 monoclonal antibodies against different PEDV strains. the amino acid sequences of the S1 subunits of spike protein of PEDV strains were aligned using the Clustal Omega program. the PEDV strains used included GDU (GenBank accession no. KU985230), FJ-9 (GenBank accession no. AGG34696), USA (GenBank accession no. AII20255), UU (GenBank accession no. KU985229), DR13 (GenBank accession no. JQ02316 none of the S10-specific antibodies (MAbs 56, 60, 63, and 72) showed any reactivity to the S-Indel spike proteins. these differences eliminated the epitope occurring in GDU S1 at the interface between domains S10 and S1A. IFA pictures showing binding of monoclonal antibodies with PEDV-infected cells determined by IFA. Binding was visualized with Alexa Fluor 488-coupled goat anti-mouse antibody. DAPI was used to visualize the cell nuclei. the antibodies that recognized the same epitope in S1 domain B strongly neutralized PEDV GDU but did not neutralize any of the other viruses, including the USA strain. the observed neutralization pattern is in good accordance with the ELISA- and IFA-based serological cross-reactivity profiles. PEDV was preincubated with each monoclonal antibody at a final concentration of 25 g/ml MAb or with phosphate-buffered saline prior to inoculation of cells. the antibodies targeting domain A, B, or CD did not inhibit hemagglutination at any concentrations tested. infection of veroCMAS cells with sia-dependent influenza A virus and PEDV GDU was reduced to 5% of that of parental Vero cells. the residual infection of PEDV GDU on the Sia-lacking VeroCMAS allowed us to assess the contribution of sia binding interference by monoclonal antibodies to neutralization. 10 MAbs 63 and 72 were used to select escape mutants by serial passaging of PEDV GDU. single nucleotide changes were found in the S gene of all mutants. escape mutants resistant to MAbs 63, 72, and 23 displayed amino acid substitutions in the spike protein. no change in binding to S1 (S1V638G) was observed for control MAb 71. binding of MAbs to mutant S1 proteins was measured by ELISA. antibody neutralization resistance of virus escape mutants was quantified. a 3-fold increase in the level of infection was measured at the antibody concentration used for the selection of this virus mutant. wild-type PEDV GDU and PEDV escape mutants isolated with MAbs 63, 72, and 23 were tested for neutralization by the selecting antibody. several S1 polypeptides encompassing one or more S1 domains were expressed and purified. all S1 polypeptides were checked by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and shown to migrate according to their expected size. MAb 71 showed considerable binding to S10A (Fig. 2D) but not to S10 (Fig. 2C) or S1ABCD (Fig. 2B) this antibody targets the boundary between S10 and S1A. MAb 71, which reacts to S10A, did not share epitope regions with either S10 or S1A antibodies. the 10 monoclonal antibodies segregated into six nonoverlapping epitope classes within PEDV S1. cross-reactivity of S1 monoclonal antibodies against different PEDV strains. monoclonal antibodies showed moderate to high cross-reactivity to spike protein S1 subunits of non-S-Indel and S-Indel strains. the amino acid sequences of the S1 subunits of spike protein of PEDV strains were aligned using the Clustal Omega program. the sequences corresponding to the different S1 domains are indicated by colored boxes, with S10 presented in blue, S1A in orange, S1B in red, and S1CD in green all graphs represent the means from three independent experiments. none of the S10-specific antibodies (MAbs 56, 60, 63, and 72) showed any reactivity to the S-Indel spike proteins. both had variable cross-reactivity to the S-Indel-type S proteins. antibodies targeting the S1 domains A, B, and CD showed no or poor reactivity against the non-S-Indel viruses. binding to S-Indel virus-infected cells was generally less efficient and more variable. the 4 MAbs that recognized the same epitope in S10 strongly neutralized the non-S-Indel viruses. MAb 69 strongly neutralized PEDV GDU but did not neutralize any of the other viruses, including the USA strain. in contrast, broad and strong neutralization of all tested non-S-Indel and S-Indel strains was observed. infected cells were stained with an anti-PEDV or anti-HA monoclonal antibody. the percentage of infected cells was calculated by counting the cells in 10 microscopic fields. interference of Sia binding as a mechanism of virus neutralization. matic depletion of sialic acids from the cell surface has been shown to significantly inhibit infection by the PEDV GDU strain. mutant Vero cell line lacking cell surface expression of Sia was generated by knockout of the CMP N-acetylneuraminic acid synthetase gene (CMAS) the neutralizing S1B MAb 23 and S10 MAbs 63 and 72 were used to select escape mutants. for each antibody we obtained escape mutants of which the spike gene was entirely sequenced. single nucleotide changes were found in the S gene of all mutants. no change in binding was observed for control antibodies MAb 71 and MAb 23. no change in binding was observed for control antibodies MAb 71 and MAb 23. a 3-fold increase in the level of infection was measured at the antibody concentration used for the selection of this virus mutant. DISCUSSION PEDV causes significant morbidity in pigs of all ages and high mortality in young piglets. a collection of 10 monoclonal antibodies against PEDV S1 was generated. six nonoverlapping epitope regions were identified within the S1 subunit. these epitope regions were distributed over the five structural domains of the S1 protein. in the CV777 strain, an amino acid substitution (V638I) occurs at the same position in S1B. both S1B antibodies still bound to S1V638G in ELISA. underlying mechanism of this antibody-dependent enhancement is difficult to comprehend. the main mechanism of virus neutralization by S10 MAbs remains unknown. the main mechanism of virus neutralization by S10 MAbs could be attributed to steric hindrance or interference with binding to other attachment factors. diversity in this region may have arisen through a long history of natural selection of variants that escape immune surveillance through mutations in neutralizing epitopes. only minor differences in cross-reactivity and cross-neutralization between non-S-Indel and S-Indel strains were seen when polyclonal antisera obtained from non-S-Indel strain-infected pigs were used. however, antigenic variation in S1 between non-S-Indel and S-Indel PEDV UU (GenBank accession no. KU985229), a contemporary Dutch S-Indel strain, was isolated with the help of the Dutch veterinary practice De Oosthof. PEDV USA, a contemporary U.S. non-S-Indel isolate, was kindly provided by MSD Animal Health (Boxmeer, The Netherlands) plasmids expressing the entire PEDV S1 subunit or a subdomain thereof fused to the Fc part of human IgG1 (Fc) or mouse IgG2a (mFc) were transiently expressed in HEK293T cells. plasmids expressing S1-Fc proteins containing single amino acid substitutions were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. each mouse received three intramuscular (i.m.) injections of PEDV S1-mFc at 4-week intervals. mice with the highest titers of antibodies against PEDV S1-mFc were further boosted by intravenously injecting 2 g of purified PEDV S1-mFc in 0.9% saline. IgG was purified from the medium using protein G-conjugated Sepharose beads (catalog no. 6511-100; BioVision) all animal experiments were conducted according to the guidelines for animal experimentation at MSD Animal Health (Boxmeer, The Netherlands). biosensor layer was reconstituted with 10 mM glycine solution (pH 2.0) cells were infected with PEDV in the presence of trypsin. one hundred microliters of these mixtures was used for inoculation of vero cells. trypsin-dependent PEDV strains were added at a final concentration of 15 g/ml. the neutralizing concentration was defined as the lowest concentration of MAbs. single-cell clones of CMAS knockout cells were obtained by limiting dilution. Knockout of CMAS expression in those cells was further confirmed by testing the cells' susceptibility to sialic acid-dependent influenza A virus (strain WSN) infection. mutant viruses were generated by growing the virus in the presence of increasing concentrations of antibody for 15 passages. PEDV USA, a contemporary U.S. non-S-Indel isolate, was kindly provided by MSD Animal Health. PEDV CV777 (GenBank accession no. AF353511), a classical S-Indel PEDV strain isolated in Belgium, was provided by Kristin van Reeth. PEDV DR13 originated from a commercial vaccine of Green Cross (Republic of Korea) plasmids expressing entire PEDV S1 subunit or subdomain fused to the Fc part of human IgG1 (Fc) or mouse IgG2a (mFc) were transiently expressed in HEK293T cells. plasmids expressing S1-Fc proteins containing single amino acid substitutions were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. the monoclonal antibody-producing hybridomas were prepared by subjecting the spleen cell population or the antigen-specific B cells isolated from those spleen cell populations. the hybridoma cultures were cloned by fluorescence-activated cell sorting-based single-cell sorting into 96-well plates. diluted horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (catalog no. P0260; Dako) or HRP-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (catalog no. 109-035-088; Jackson ImmunoResearch) was added and the mixture was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. cells were infected with PEDV in the presence of trypsin. the inoculum was removed and the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C. the binding of S1 monoclonal antibodies was detected with a goat anti-mouse antibody-Alexa Fluor 488. hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay for PEDV was used to measure HAI activity by monoclonal antibodies. a human erythrocyte suspension (0.5% in PBS) was added. the specific HAI activity (HAI titer of the MAb represents the lowest concentration of antibody showing HAI activity. mutant viruses were generated by growing the virus in the presence of increasing concentrations of antibody for 15 passages. virus was harvested from infected cells by three cycles of freeze-thawing."}
