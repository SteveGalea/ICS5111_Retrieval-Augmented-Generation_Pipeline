{"summary": "the need to plan and prepare for potentially overwhelming infectious outbreaks has added a whole new set of challenges to the practice of pediatric critical care medicine. this chapter provides a brief overview of the history of pandemics as well as the current status of planning for a potential epidemic outbreak. the majority of the chapter is devoted to discussing issues specific to hospital planning. the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus produced the first pandemic to test the limits of modern medical care of this era. the virus emerged in Mexico and eventually reached 214 countries (7). the united states saw roughly 60.8 million cases with 12,468 deaths (8). this virus infected 28,616 people with 11,310 deaths (12) this outbreak resulted in 36 cases and 15 deaths outside of west africa. this outbreak resulted in 11 people treated in the united states, 4 of whom contracted the virus outside of west africa. this has prompted local, state, and national agencies to make huge investments into preparation for pandemics in the future. health-care coalitions were among the major gaps less commonly identified. progress in pediatric specific planning has been made as mentioned in the introduction. but important gaps remain in pediatric disaster planning. a wide variety of helpful planning, pediatric specific, guidelines and tools to assist local and regional planning. there are several useful resources to assist local and regional planning. staff refers not just to providers and nurses but all support services needed to care for patients, families, and staff. systems are the coordinated command and control centers and supporting services that provide efficient, coordinated flow of resources, patients, and information. crisis standards of care (CSC) should enable specific legal and regulatory protections for health care providers when having to operate under conditions of limited medical resources and alternate models of care. it is reasonable to incorporate this concept into local facility plans as well to provide similar guidance and protections for staff in the absence of a formal declaration. in the setting of a pandemic, all local ICUs are likely to be operating at capacity and this may limit supply. in the setting of a pandemic, all local ICUs are likely to be operating at capacity and this may be one of the possible causes of the difference in mortality. critical pharmaceutical availability should be considered and planned for in a multidisciplinary manner. partnering with pharmacy services in planning is essential to developing an informed and adaptive system. partnering with pharmacy services in planning is essential to developing an informed and adaptive system. a disaster found inadequate PICU capacity for a moderate disaster without CSC and in a large scale disaster even with CSC there was not adequate capacity to meet the demands (42). the use of CSC including limiting care to \u201cessential\u201d interventions only led to a 47% reduction in predicted mortality and an increase in ability to meet the care needs of children in separate pandemic simulations (2,43). there are 1,976 pediatric critical care diplomates in good standing in the u.s. there are significant variability in density state to state from zero to 1:30,000 children. a strategy to augment these regional potential shortages should include utilization of emergency credentialing and either local or telephonic consultation. planning with this multi-disciplinary approach is critical in identifying vulnerabilities. a command structure with clearly defined roles and lines of communication should be defined prior to a pandemic. a command structure with clearly defined roles and lines of communication should be defined prior to a pandemic and can be part of these exercises. crisis standards of care (CSC) should be included in the planning process. a regional approach requires interoperable and compatible critical care supplies. a regional approach requires interoperable and compatible critical care supplies. planning for the provision of food and shelter should be considered as part of this multidisciplinary approach. the strategic u.s. national stockpile was estimated to have only around 5,000 ventilators, most of which are not effective for infants. a study comparing outcomes in canada and canada found up to 97% of patients in the ICU required mechanical ventilation. there are roughly 80,000 adult ICU beds and 357 pediatric intensive care units with a median of 12 beds in the US with significant regional variation in per capita beds and PICU trained staff. the low relative number of dedicated pediatric beds coupled with high variability in pediatric care specialist density could lead to significant shortage of specialty care in a pandemic setting. a small community or critical access hospital would use regional expert consultation to increase emergency credentialing for local adult intensivists, respiratory therapists, pediatric hospitalists, and nurses to care for critically ill pediatric patients. a strategy to augment these regional potential shortages should include utilization of emergency credentialing and either local or telephonic consultation. training should be in place and has demonstrated effectiveness (32,47) local database tracking of training and skill sets of all nursing staff would increase the ability to \u201cflex\u201d appropriately cross-trained staff. comprehensive ongoing training and documentation of legal protection of staff working outside their normal domains should be in place within institutional CSC. the 2014 Chest Task Force recommended that these command centers consider transfer of assets rather than patients in the setting of a pandemic (32). these command centers should also help plan and coordinate a system for patient tracking, identification, and the ability to communicate with family members and next of kin. use of non-invasive ventilation or use of anesthesia machines to augment traditional ventilator supplies should be considered while developing CSC and local policies. protocols for allocation of other critical resources such as antimicrobials, vaccines, other medications and advanced life support measures should be established. triage planning includes local outpatient clinics and emergency departments. ideally there would be a triage algorithm to validate a patient\u2019s need for scarce ICU resources while CSC are in place. current literature on triage planning has predominantly focused on the adult population. the threat of the next pandemic will require dramatic changes in the practices we have habituated. it is vital that facilities establish ethically sound triage policies for entry into an ICU and for advanced care once patients arrive to the ICU to mitigate emotional distress of staff. \"enhanced infection control\" measures should be implemented. training is required to educate staff on appropriate donning/doffing of PPE. staffing is also an important component of infection control. in 2009, the institute of medicine published guidelines to aid in establishing CSC for disaster planning (61). no ethical model or framework is perfectly suited to delineate allocation of resources in times of scarce resources which places high priority on eliciting provider and community involvement during disaster planning. any plan for pediatric care in a pandemic will be imperfect but should afford the relationships, flexibility and knowledge to adapt to an ever changing threat."}
