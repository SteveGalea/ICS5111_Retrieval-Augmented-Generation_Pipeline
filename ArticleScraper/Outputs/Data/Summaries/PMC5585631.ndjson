{"summary": "the currently available anti-influenza drugs have made a remarkable contribution to the treatment of influenza. adverse effects, compliance problems, limited supply, and high cost are major concerns when prescribing neuraminidase inhibitors. traditional herbal medicines have long played an important role in countries in the far East, especially Japan, China, and Korea. maoto has an anti-influenza drug effect on the host's endocytic system and defense. we studied the anti-influenza effect of maoto using a culturing system in which lung epithelial cells were experimentally infected with influenza virus. the latter three strains were the components of the influenza vaccine used in the 2011-2012 winter season in Japan. the virus titer was determined on MDCK cells according to the methods of Reed and Muench [16], using a 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) the cells were stained with anti-matrix protein 2 (M2) (Thermo Scientific), anti-haemagglutinin (HA) (ViroStat, Portland, ME) mAb. acidified organelles were stained with dyes, LysoSensor green (ThermoFisher, Yokohama, Japan) and Acridine orange (ThermoFisher) cells were stained with 7-amino-actinomycin D and Annexin V. 2.6. real-time PCR analysis was performed using a 7500 real-time PCR system. the virus titer was determined on MDCK cells according to the methods of Reed and Muench [16], using the methods of Reed and Muench [16]. the virus titer was determined on MDCK cells according to the methods of. Reed and Muench [16]. infection with Influenza Virus For the attachment of virus to the cell surface, suspended virus at a moi of 1\u2013100 was added to confluent monolayers of A549 cells. cells were washed twice with cold PBS to remove extracellular viruses and then cultured for the indicated amount of time with or without antivirus reagents at 37\u00b0C. the cells were stained with anti-matrix protein 2 (M2) (Thermo Scientific), anti-haemagglutinin (HA) or anti-nucleoprotein (NP) (ViroStat, Portland, ME) mAb. acidified organelles were stained with dyes, LysoSensor green (ThermoFisher, Yokohama, Japan) and Acridine orange (ThermoFisher) real-time PCR analysis was performed using a 7500 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with SYBR Green Kit (Takara, Tokyo, Japan) the following primers were used: GAPDH-Fw: 5\u2032-TCCACCACCCTGTTCCTGTA-3\u2032, GAPDH-Rv: 5\u2032-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3\u2032, PA-Rv: 5\u2032-CCGAGAAGCATTAAG differences between groups were determined using the unpaired Student t-test. p values of 0.05 were considered statistically significant. culture supernatants were assayed for the titer of extracellular infectious virus. the lowest virus titer, 1.3 log10 TCID50/ml, was obtained with 800 g/ml maoto. only Ephedra Herb and Cinnamon Bark had a significant antivirus effect. maoto inhibited propagation in vitro. all cell lines infected with influenza viruses (moi = 1) were cultured for 24 hr. then culture supernatants were assayed for the titer of infectious virus. the virus titer in wells cultured with maoto was significantly lower than the titers with the control medium. maoto had superior capacity to inhibit the propagation of influenza virus compared to the tested neuraminidase and M2 proton channel inhibitors. maoto inhibits intracellular protein derived from PR8. proteins derived from PR8 were visualized by labeled mAb. cell lysates were assayed by western blot analysis for M2 protein. maoto did not induce an intracellular antiviral molecule related to type I or type III IFNs in influenza virus infection. mRNA levels of IFN-, IFN-1, PKR, and MxA cultured with maoto were measured by real-time PCR. maoto inhibits endosomal acidification by blocking V-ATPase present at the membrane of intracellular organelles. lysoSensor green and Acridine orange are selectively taken up by living cells and concentrated in acidic organelles. in untreated cells, accumulation of LysoSensor green and Acridine orange was seen 30 min after infection. after 60 min, dotted fluorescence was reduced and the fluorescence diffusely spread to cytoplasm and nucleus. maoto can block the V-ATPase function and inhibit entry of influenza virus into cytoplasm. the number of influenza virus particles visualized by HA-staining showed a greater increase when compared to the control. intracellular influenza virus at 30 and 60 min after infection was visualized by the staining of mAb to HA (green), followed by staining with DAPI. maoto is not toxic for cell lines and influenza viruses. a549 cells were cultured with 0 to 1,000 g/ml maoto for 24 hr. culture supernatants were assayed for the titer of extracellular infectious virus. oto significantly exceeded that of 10 M laninamivir and 1,000 M amantadine. a control test of daikenchuto showed that it was also effective. but the effect was limited compared to maoto. maoto inhibited the propagation of influenza virus compared to the tested neuraminidase and M2 proton channel inhibitors. maoto had superior capacity to inhibit the propagation of influenza virus compared to the tested neuraminidase and M2 proton channel inhibitors. western blot analysis showed that cell lysates from the culture treated with maoto contained less M2 protein than the control medium. the anti-influenza virus effect depends not only on the reduced frequency of cells infected with influenza virus, but also on reduced production of influenza virus per cell. mRNA levels of IFN-, IFN-1, PKR, and MxA cultured with maoto were remarkably reduced. maoto did not induce an intracellular antiviral molecule related to type I or type III IFNs in influenza virus infection. maoto inhibits endosomal acidification and uncoating of influenza virus. earliest phase (0\u201330 min) had the most antiviral activity. earliest phase (0\u201330 min) had most antiviral activity. e present at the membrane of intracellular organelles, such as endosomes and lysosomes, is selectively taken up by living cells and concentrated in acidic organelles (pH 4.5\u20136.0) the latter can be visualized as green fluorescence and orange fluorescence: orange in high concentration and green in low concentration. acidified endosomes and lysosomes at 0, 30, and 60 min were visualized by fluorescence microscopy. the latter can be visualized as green fluorescence and the latter as orange fluorescence in high concentration. the number of influenza virus particles visualized by HA-staining after treatment with maoto showed a greater increase when compared to the control. neuraminidase inhibitors exert an antiviral effect by combining with the viral molecules and inhibiting their function. maoto may have the potential to enhance the host's innate defense system and inhibit viral infection. bafilomycin A1, chloroquine, and diphyllin also block endosomal acidification and inhibit influenza virus propagation. it has been reported that influenza viruses enhance the function of V-ATPase for their infectivity. several Kampo medicines including maoto have been reported to inhibit the growth of influenza virus through a defect of translation. maoto had a quick effect on influenza-related symptoms, such as fever, headache, and myalgia."}
