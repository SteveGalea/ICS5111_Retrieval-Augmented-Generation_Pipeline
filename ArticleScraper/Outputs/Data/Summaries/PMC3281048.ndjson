the overall mortality rate in china decreased from 66 cases per million in 1975 to 5 cases per million in 1995. the overall mortality rate in china decreased from 66 cases per million in 1975 to 5 cases per million in 1995. the overall mortality rate in china decreased from 66 cases per million in 1975 to 5 cases per million in 2008. by 2008, STIs and HIV (39.5%) has become the mostly deadly infectious disease, followed by bacterial infections (24.7%) and zoonoses (20.0%) During the period 2005\u20132008, these three types of diseases have led to approximately 12,500, 13,300 and 11,400 deaths in China, respectively. since 1990, the number of annual reported plague cases has increased to approximately 52, which is equivalent to 0.004 per 100,000 population per year. there is no observed trend in the mean annual mortality due to plague during 1999\u20132008. 69 to +20 Malaria 0.0087 0.0040 14 26 to +1 Dengue fever 0.0100 0.0051 42* 80 to +66 Zoonotic infections Leptospirosis

the number of cases in 1980, with an annual notification rate of four cases per 100,000 population (Figure 2a) the rate gradually subsided but there was a second major outbreak in the early 1990s. the disease is well controlled, with a mean annual decline in mortality due to the disease of 48% (95% CI, 12\u201370%, Table 2). measles mortality and morbidity has declined continuously and substantially since 1978. from 1995 to 2007, the incidence was less than one per 100,000 population. limited small-scale outbreaks continue to occur among vulnerable children in rural areas with low routine immunisation coverage. polio vaccination alone has saved 1,128,000 children in china from disabling disease and suffering. pertussis and tetanus experienced significant annual decays at rates of 44% (95% CI, 23\u201359%) and 12% (95 CI%, 30\u201365%) localised outbreak occurred in Xing-An county in the southern province of Guangxi. 61,030 doses of Vi polysaccharide vaccine were administered in 1999. no further typhoid fever outbreaks were reported in china. zoonotic infections Rabies is one of the zoonotic diseases on the rise in china. a total of 117,530 human rabies cases were reported between 1950 and 2007, corresponding to an incidence rate of 9.1 cases per 100,000 population. three major epidemics were observed [31], [32]: the first occurred in the mid-1950s when the annual number of reported cases reached a peak of about 2,000. china reported 5,327 (66%) of the 8,071 SARS cases globally. the first human case of highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) virus was reported in 1997. by 2009, mainland China had 88 avian influenza outbreaks among birds in 23 provinces. in 2010, the epidemic had spread to 15 countries. annual number of notified cases of brucellosis dropped below 0.01 per 100,000 population in 2008. mortality rate due to brucellosis remains very low and stable. rates due to leptospriosis and anthrax have dropped significantly, by 20% and 31%, respectively, during 1999 to 2008. in 2004, china reported approximately 140,000 TB cases, accounting for about one third of the estimated global burden of MDR TB. in some provinces, the proportion of MDR TB among newly notified TB cases is as high as 19.4%, and 14.9% of MDR TB cases were XDR during 2007 to 2009 [48] the mortality due to TB increased at a rate of 28% (95% CI, 14\u201343%) per year. notifiable STIs have re-emerged, leading to a fast-spreading epidemic. in 1987, the incidence for STIs was 6.64 per 100,000 population. in 1996, the rate increased to 34.6 per 100,000 population. the first case of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in china was reported in 1985, but a local HIV epidemic was not detected until 1989 when a cluster of infections was diagnosed among IDUs in Yunnan province [65] in 2007, the number rose to 200,000. the latest estimates show that 700,000 people were living with HIV/AIDS in China at the end of 2007. in the early 1990s, the annual number of reported HAV diagnoses was more than 50 per 100,000 population. this dropped by 90% to 5 per 100,000 population in 2005 to 2006. the mean annual death rate due to HAV decreased at 21% (95% CI, 8\u201332%) during 1999 to 2008. 67\u201371% of the 700,000 registered IDUs in china are infected with HCV [79], [80], [81] and 17\u201326% of them are infected with HBV [79], [82]. the prevalence of HIV/HCV coinfection is 6.45% in IDUs [80], [83], whereas the figure for HIV/HBV coinfection is 3.7% [84]. ance activities are therefore essential to inform and prioritise public health responses. the rapid rise in notified cases of STIs, especially HIV infection, and viral hepatitis in china is associated with growth of the sex industry, increasingly frequent risky sexual behaviours. widespread underreporting exists in the Chinese infectious diseases surveillance system. but little is known about the extent of underreporting as systematic evaluations have never been conducted. a comprehensive evaluation would also involve assessments of the effectiveness of the surveillance system. transmission of zoonotic infectious agents relies on close interaction between infected animals and humans. only 30% of dog owners register their animals with government authorities. only 2\u20138% of dogs are vaccinated against rabies. number of dams in china has substantially increased the risk of schistosomiasis emergence and its spread to non-endemic areas of the country. the dense population conditions in urban China and the high mobility of its floating migrants substantially promote the rapid transmission of tuberculosis. estimated number of diagnosed cases, death cases and case fatality rate of eight major notifable infectious disease types in

to 5 cases per million. zoonoses, bacterial infections and gastrointestinal diseases were the greatest causes of death. but the rank of composition shifted to zoonoses (22%), viral hepatitis (17.3%) and quarantinable diseases (15.3%) by 2008, STIs and HIV (39.5%) has become the mostly deadly infectious disease, followed by bacterial infections (24.3%) between 1944 and 1949, there were 179 notified outbreaks of plague across china, which resulted in an estimated 2.4 million deaths. from 1950 to 1954, the mean number of annual notifications of plague infection was 1,373 cases per year [11], [12]. since 1990, the number of annual reported plague cases has increased to approximately 52. there is no observed trend in the mean annual mortality due to plague during 1999\u20132008.

to a large peak in the number of cases in 1980. the rate gradually subsided but there was a second major outbreak in the early 1990s. measles vaccine (one-dose schedule) was introduced in the country in 1965. from 1978 it has been administered routinely to all infants. mortality and morbidity has declined continuously and substantially since 1978. limited small-scale outbreaks continue to occur among vulnerable children. pertussis and tetanus decreased to below 0.5 cases per 100,000 population. infant mortality rate dropped from 20% in 1950 to 1.7% in 2006. polio vaccination alone has saved 1,128,000 children in china from disabling disease. the number of reported deaths due to these infections has decreased at a mean rate of 22% (95% CI, 2\u201339%) per year. however, these infections remain endemic in some rural areas of southern china, where there is a lack of adequate sewage disposal and safe water supplies. forest encephalitis, tsutsugamushi disease and epidemic typhus were reduced to very low levels by the late 1980s. the number of visceral leishmaniasis (also known as kala-azar), japanese encephalitis, malaria and dengue fever epidemics has also decreased, with few cases per year. since 2000, there has been a third outbreak, in which the number of cases has increased rapidly. in 2007, the number of notified cases climbed to 3,250 [34], [35] rabies-related mortality rate increased from 1999 to 2008 by a mean of 26% (95% CI, 14\u201337%) per year. this should serve as a call for action to prevent further spread of rabies in china. cases of leptospirosis, anthrax and brucellosis have remained at low levels since 2000. there was an increase in the number of notified cases of brucellosis from 0.17 per 100,000 population in 2000 to 1.50 per 100,000 population in 2007. the annual number of notified cases of leptospriosis and anthrax dropped below 0.01 per 100,000 population in 2008. since 2000, multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB have emerged as a severe public health issue in the country. in 2004, china reported approximately 140,000 MDR TB cases, accounting for about one third of the estimated global burden of MDR TB. in 1987, the incidence for STIs was 6.64 per 100,000 population. in 1996, the rate increased to 34.6 per 100,000 population. since early 1980s, underground prostitution has again become rampant in major cities. the first case of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in china was reported in 1985. before 2000, china had fewer than 20,000 reported HIV/AIDS cases, but in 2007, the number rose to 200,000. 70,000 new infections added every year since then [66] and 20,000\u201330,000 annual AIDS-related deaths [67]. in the early 1990s, the annual number of reported HAV diagnoses was more than 50 per 100,000 population. in the early 1990s, the annual number of reported HAV diagnoses was more than 50 per 100,000 population. this dropped by 90% to 5 per 100,000 population in 2005 to 2006. 67\u201371% of the 700,000 registered IDUs in china are infected with HCV [79], [80], [81] and 17\u201326% of them are infected with HBV [79], [82]. the prevalence of HIV/HCV coinfection is 6.45% in IDUs [80], [83]. ically infected people (5\u201315%) and an elevated proportion (0.894%) among STIs and HIV-infected individuals. the rapid rise in the number of notified cases of STIs, especially HIV infection, and viral hepatitis in china is associated with growth of the sex industry. china has established an efficient surveillance system for human infectious diseases [6], [85]. it is widely perceived that underreporting exists in the Chinese infectious diseases surveillance system. but little is known about the extent of underreporting as systematic evaluations have never been conducted. floating immigrants have been found to be more vulnerable to infectious diseases, especially STIs, HIV and viral hepatitis. the capacity of current healthcare system cannot meet the needs of both surveillance activities and health problems of these migrant workers. the infectious disease surveillance system needs to be tailored for its high mobility. the absence of epidemiological and behavioural data on animal infectious diseases is a strong barrier to effective surveillance and control. the formation of a large number of dams in china have substantially increased the risk of schistosomiasis emergence."}
