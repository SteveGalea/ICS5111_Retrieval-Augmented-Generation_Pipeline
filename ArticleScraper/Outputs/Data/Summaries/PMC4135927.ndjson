{"summary": "highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) of the H5N1, H7N1 and H7N7 subtypes occasionally cross the species barrier between domesticated birds and humans. these viruses could become transmissible between humans through reassortment with circulating swine or human influenza viruses or by gradually accumulating mutations. influenza vaccines supplemented with NA have improved efficacy (9\u201311) hemagglutinin is a codeterminant of influenza A virus pathogenicity (12\u201314) and is involved in limiting IAV superinfections and reassortment (15). oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir target NA. VHHs can interact with cognate antigens with affinities matching the best affinities of conventional Abs. the VHH tends to target concave-shaped epitopes, in contrast to the planar epitopes that are typically recognized by \u201cclassical\u201d light- and heavy-chain Abs. NIBRG-14 and NIBRG-23 are 2:6 reverse genetics-derived reassortants with NA and HA segments derived from A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1) and AturkeyTurkey2005 (H5N1) respectively. the other six genome segments from A/PR/8/34 (41) were rescued by transfection of cocultured HEK-293T and MDCK cells. all of the HA segments of these H5 RG-14 (NIBRG-14ma) and H5N1 H274Y (H5N1 H274Yma) were sequenced and found to be identical to those of the parental viruses. pH1N1 was derived from a clinical isolate of the pH1N1 virus of 2009 and was adapted to mice by serial passage (42). pAcMP2n1rec was generated by cotransfection of pAcMP2n1rec. baculovirus was generated by linearized DNA of Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) into Sf9 insect cells (derived from Spodoptera frugiperda) the supernatant was harvested and clarified by centrifugation. monovalent N1-VHHm (N1-vhhm) with two n1-vhhm moieties fused by a flexible linker (llama IgG2c hinge) and a carboxy-terminal hexahistidine tag (his) (middle) for expression in transgenic A. thaliana seeds, the insert was cloned into the seed-specific expression cassette of the PphasGW vector. the three-dimensional structure of monomeric N1rec-binding VHHs (N1-VHHm) is represented in a white ribbon structure. the symbols * and \u00b0 indicate N1-VHHm from the same clonal families. two parts of n-butanol were added to three parts of cleared, AcNPVN1rec-infected Sf9 cell supernatant. the mixture was shaken vigorously for 5 min. the aqueous phase, containing soluble N1rec, was separated from the organic phase, diluted 2.5 times in 5 mM KH2PO4 (pH 6.6) NA activity was quantified by measuring the rate of cleavage of the fluorogenic substrate 4-MUNANA (2\u2032-4-methylumbelliferyl--d-N-acetylneuraminic acid, sodium salt hydrate; Sigma-Aldrich) into 4-methylumbelliferone. the plates were washed three times with PBS\u20130.1% Tween 20. they were then incubated with 50 l PNA-HRP (2.5 g/ml in PBS\u20130.05% Tween 20) at room temperature. the plates were then washed three times with PBS. PstI and NotI restriction sites were inserted into the amplified sequences with primers A6E and 38. transformants were grown in 2TY medium (supplemented with 100 g/ml ampicillin and 1% glucose) the resulting VHH phage display library was panned four times with solid-phase coated N1rec. cells were grown in TB medium supplemented with 100 g/ml ampicillin, 2 mM CaCl2 and 0.1% glucose. periplasmic extracts were centrifuged at 8,000 rpm and 4\u00b0C. monovalent N1rec-binding VHH was concentrated with a Vivaspin 5,000-kDa cutoff filter. N1rec or M2e-tGCN4 (44) at 10 g/ml was used to coat 96-well MaxiSorp plates overnight at 100 l/well. blocking was performed overnight with 5% skim milk in PBS. excess VHH was removed by three washes with PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20. biacore T00 evaluation software was used to calculate association rate constants (Kon), dissociation rate constants (Koff) and equilibrium dissociation constants (KD = Koff/Kon) the coding information for N1-3-VHHm and N1-5-VHHm was amplified with primers MH (CATGCCATGGGAGCTTTGGGGGGTCTTCGCTGTGT) and A4short (CATGCCATGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG the three different n1-vhh-fc sequences coding for N1-3-VHHm, N1-5-VHHm, and N1-7-VHHm fused to the mouse IgG2a Fc fragment (N1-VHH-Fc) were synthesized commercially (GenScript) and cloned into a PphasGW binary transfer DNA (T-DNA) vector, resulting in the PphasGWn1-vhh-f generations T1 to T3 were produced and screened for best N1-VHH-Fc expressers. 1 g of transformed A. thaliana seeds was crushed in 25 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)\u2013200 mM NaCl\u20135 mM EDTA\u20130.1% (vol/vol) samples containing monovalent N1-3/5/7-VHHm, bivalent N1-3/5-VHHb, bivalent N1-3/5/7/GP4-VHH-Fc, oseltamivir, or control medium were mixed with 0.8% Avicel RC-591 as an overlay. after 2 to 4 days of incubation, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min. asal administration of N1-VHHm, N1-VHHb, or N1-VHH-Fc. mice were challenged 4 or 24 h later, as indicated, with 6 LD50s (H5N1 H274Yma) or 4 LD50s (NIBRG-14ma) of virus. a 30% loss of body weight was the endpoint at which sick mice were euthanized. NIBRG-14ma virus was serially diluted and used to infect MDCK cells in the presence of N1-3-VHHm (4.2 M) or N1-5-VHHm (3.7 M), a dose corresponding to 10 times the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50). escape virus isolates were amplified by growth on MDCK cells overlaid with 0.6% low-melting-point agarose. ELISA plates were incubated with different concentrations of N1-3-VHHm, N1-3-VHHb, N1-5-VHHm, or N1-5-VHHb. the plates were incubated with different concentrations of N1-3-VHHm, N1-3-VHHb, or N1-5-VHHb. the plates were incubated with different concentrations of N1-VHHs. 7.5 23.6 3.8 148 BL-VHHbe >15,448 >32,896 >32,896 N1-3-VHH-Fc 1.31 0.605 324 23.08 79 89.4 7.8 71 24.2 3.7 177 N1-5-VHH-Fc 1.49 0.746 251 28.14 30 >17,083 27.03 129 N1-7-VHH-Fc >7,900 >5,260 >5,260 NIBRG-14 and NIBRG-23 are 2:6 reverse genetics-derived reassortants with NA and HA segments derived from A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1) and AturkeyTurkey2005 (H5N1), respectively, and the other six segments from A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) viruses. the virus was rescued by transfection of cocultured HEK-293T and MDCK cells. a clinical isolate of the pH1N1 virus of 2009 was adapted to mice by serial passage (42) the median tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) and median lethal dose (LD50) of the NIBRG-14ma and H5N1 H274Yma viruses were calculated by the method of Reed and Muench (43). all of the experiments described above were performed in biosafety level 2+ rooms. rosis virus (AcNPV) generates N1rec encoding recombinant baculovirus. cells infected with AcNPVN1rec were incubated at 28\u00b0C. the supernatant was harvested and clarified by centrifugation (1 h at 50,000 g) al periplasmic signal sequence (pelB), n1-vhhm coding information, and a carboxy-terminal hexahistidine tag (his) for expression in transgenic A. thaliana seeds, the N1-VHH-Fc insert was cloned into the seed-specific expression cassette of the PphasGW vector. the colored histogram denotes the homology between the sequences. silico prediction of the three-dimensional structure of monomeric N1rec-binding VHHs (N1-VHHm) structures were predicted with ESyPred3D. diagrams were generated with DeepView software. the aqueous phase, containing soluble N1rec, was separated from the organic phase, diluted 2.5 times in 5 mM KH2PO4 (pH 6.6), and passed through a 0.22-m filter. the diluted phase was applied to an XK2670 column (GE Healthcare) packed with HA Ultrogel hydroxyapatite chromatography sorbent (Pall) and eluted with a gradient of 5 to 400 m the NA activity reaction was performed with 200 mM sodium acetate (NaAc)\u20132 mM CaCl2 with 1% butanol and 1 mM 4-MUNANA. a standard curve of increasing concentrations of soluble 4-methylumbelliferone was included to correlate the fluorescence intensity with the molar amount of 4-methylumbelliferone/min. IAV dilutions containing the N1-VHHm concentrations indicated were transferred to a black 96-well plate. 75 l of 20 M 4-MUNANA was added and incubated 1 h at 37\u00b0C. a 100-l volume of stop solution was then added to each well. the resulting PCR product (550 bp) and the pHEN4 vector were digested with PstI and NotI. transformants were grown in 2TY medium (supplemented with 100 g/ml ampicillin and 1% glucose) the resulting VHH phage display library was panned four times with solid-phase coated N1rec. periplasmic extracts were centrifuged at 8,000 rpm and 4\u00b0C. supernatant was applied to a His Select Nickel Affinity gel. monovalent N1rec-binding VHH was concentrated with a Vivaspin 5,000-kDa cutoff filter. the 13 N1-VHHm candidates were incubated for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. excess VHH was removed by three washes with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20. each monovalent N1-VHHm was diluted in HBS buffer. the coding information for N1-3-VHHm and N1-5-VHHm was amplified with primers MH and A4short. the primer introduced the hinge sequence of llama 2c (AHHSEDPSSKAPKAPMA) to separate the two N1-VHHm domains. these bivalent constructs were expressed and purified from the periplasmic fraction of E. coli as outlined above. three different n1-vhh-fc sequences fused at amino-terminal end with 2S2 signal peptide and at carboxy-terminal end with the Fc region of mouse IgG2a. the coronavirus GP4 subunit protein fused to the same mouse IgG2a Fc moiety (GP4-Fc) mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)\u2013200 mM NaCl\u20135 mM EDTA\u20130.1% (vol/vol) Tween 20\u2013Complete protease inhibitor tablets were clarified by centrifugation and applied to a protein G Sepharose column. between 1 and 10 mg of N1-VHH-Fc was recovered. cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min. cells were permeabilized with 20 mM glycine containing 0.5% (vol/vol) Triton X-100. anti-mouse whole IgG-HRP was used to visualize plaques with the TrueBlue peroxidase substrate (KPL) mice were challenged 4 or 24 h later with 6 LD50s (H5N1 H274Yma) or 4 LD50s (NIBRG-14ma) of virus (50 l, divided equally between the nostrils) a 30% loss of body weight was the endpoint at which sick mice were euthanized. NIBRG-14ma virus was serially diluted and used to infect MDCK cells in the presence of N1-3-VHHm (4.2 M) or N1-5-VHHm (3.7 M), a dose corresponding to 10 times the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) escape mutants were screened by monitoring cytopathic effects. N1-3-VHH and N1-5-VHH in a mono- or bivalent format inhibit N1rec activity and reduce the plaque size of H5N1 virus-infected cells. 24.2 3.7 177 N1-5-VHH-Fc 1.49 0.746 251 28.14 30 >17,083 27.03 129 N1-7-VHH-Fc >7,900 >5,260 >5,260 GP4-Fcf >7,260 >5,260 >5,260. a Mean plaque IC50 from two independent plaque assays performed in duplicate. the N1rec coding sequence was cloned into a pAcMP2 expression vector (pAcMP2n1rec) under the control of the AcNPV basic protein promoter. infection of Sf9 cells with recombinant baculovirus AcNPVN1rec resulted in sialidase activity in the cell supernatant. N1rec protein was purified from the supernatant of infected Sf the binding of the N1-VHHm proteins to N1rec was assessed by ELISA. compared with binding to the recombinant M2e-tGCN4 protein. none of the N1-VHHm proteins bound substantially to the recombinant M2e-tGCN4 protein. prior binding of N1-3-VHHm to N1rec abolished subsequent binding of N1-1-VHHm, N1-5-VHHm, and N1-6-VHHm. this suggests that binding of N1-3-VHHm sterically hinders binding of N1-5-VHHm while N1-7-VHHm binds a different epitope. the amino acid sequences of the NA of NIBRG-14ma and N1rec are highly homologous, with only 13 amino acid differences. the size of NIBRG-14ma plaques was reduced in a concentration-dependent manner, with IC50s in the low nanomolar range. valent n1-3-vhhb and n1-5-vhhb expression elements were expressed in coli. despite repeated attempts, we could not generate an expression plasmid. the corresponding proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified. llama IgG2c-derived hinge is sensitive to trypsin. shown is Coomassie-stained reducing SDS-PAGE of purified N1-3-VHHm, N1-5-VHHm, N1-3-VHHb and N1-5-VHHb. the n1-3-vhh, n1-5-vhh, and n1-7-vhh genes were fused to the sequence encoding the hinge and Fc tail of mouse IgG2a (n1-vhh-fc) these n1-vhh-fc constructs were cloned into the binary vector Pphas as a T-DNA expression cassette. N1-VHH-Fc and N1-5-VHH-Fc had stronger N1rec inhibition capacity. bivalent N1-7-VHH-Fc bound to N1rec in ELISAs. but it failed to inhibit N1rec and the H5N1 viruses in vitro. clade 2 H5N1 viruses are responsible for most of these zoonotic infections with HPAIV (61). N1-3-VHHb, N1-5-VHHb, N1-3-VHH-Fc, and N1-5-VHH-Fc reduced the in vitro growth of the NIBRG-23 virus with an IC50 in the low micromolar range. compared to NIBRG-14ma, the H5N1 H274Y IC50s were 3- to 7-fold higher but still in the low nanomolar range. we conclude that the three formats of N1-3-VHH evaluated can inhibit the growth of the H5N1 H274Y virus in vitro and that both bivalent formats have enhanced in vitro antiviral activity. bivalent molecules N1-3-VHHb, N1-5-VHHb, N1-3-VHH-Fc, and N1-5-VHH-Fc significantly inhibited NA activity on both substrates. fetuin and 4-MUNANA were used as substrates. a t test was used to determine the significance of differences between groups. ELISA plates were coated with 8 HA units of NIBRG-14 or A/New Caledonia/20/99 (New Caledonia) virus. after blocking, wells were incubated with different concentrations of N1-3-VHHm, N1-3-VHHb, N1-5-VHHm, or N1-5-VHHb as indicated (nanomolar concentration of VHH) both bivalent N1-5-VHHb formats inhibited pH1N1 virion-associated NA activity, suggesting a degree of intrasubtype inhibitory effect of the N1-VHHs. the endotoxin levels of the VHH preparations that were used in vivo were low and comparable for the NA-specific VHH proteins. N1-5-VHHm, N1-7-VHHm, SA-VHHm, and oseltamivir had large lung virus loads ranging from 104.75 to 106.48 TCID50s/ml. all of the N1-VHH-treated groups showed high viral RNA levels 96 h after infection, comparable to those of the PBS-treated group. these results are in line with the RT-qPCR results and confirmed the presence of endotoxin levels in purified VHH preparations VHH Mean LPS content (EU/ml) a SEM N1-3-VHHm 0.094 0.007 N1-5-VHHm 0.096 0.017 N1-7-VHHm 0.095 0.012 SA-VHHm 0.094 0.008 N1-3-VHHb 0.092 0.005 N1-5-VHHb 0.093 0.007 BL-VHHb 0.107 0.0 amivir and SA-VHHm were given 100 g of the N1-VHHm indicated intranasally 4 h before a challenge with 4 LD50s of NIBRG-14ma. intranasal administration of 30 g of H5-VHHb and daily oral administration of oseltamivir were included as positive controls. seltamivir (45 mg/kg/day, daily by gavage) were included as positive controls. the potency of the bivalent formats of the inhibitory N1-VHHs against the tested H5N1 viruses was 30- to 240-fold higher than that of their monovalent counterparts. treatment with the bivalent formats of N1-5-VHH resulted in a reduction of morbidity that was significant at 60, 72, and 96 hpi compared with that of the negative controls. a challenge revealed that all of the challenged groups, except H5-VHHb-treated mice (no virus detectable), had large and comparable lung virus loads. -14ma challenge and reduce lung-associated NA activity, a surrogate for the viral load, in mice with NIBRG-14ma (4 LD50s) mice were treated intranasally with 60, 12, 2.5, or 0.5 g of N1-3-VHHb or N1-5-VHHb before a challenge. a single intranasal dose of 12 or 2.5 g of N1-3-VHHb or N1-5-VHHb provided partial protection against death but failed to reduce morbidity. a single additional intranasal dose of N1-3-VHHb, N1-5-VHHb, or BL-VHHb was given on day 6 after infection for the highest dose (60 g) of these VHHs only. plant-produced N1-VHH-Fc protects against morbidity and death after a challenge with NIBRG-14ma. oseltamivir (45 mg/day/kg) was given to a group of three mice by daily gavage starting 24 h before the challenge. two bivalent formats of N1-3-VHH and N1-5-VHH protect mice against a challenge with oseltamivir-resistant H5N1. a single dose of both bivalent formats can protect against a potentially lethal challenge with an H5N1 virus. a group was treated by daily oral administration of oseltamivir (1 mg/kg/day), a dose that has been reported to fully protect laboratory mice against a challenge with highly pathogenic H5N1 (64). a single intranasal administration of N1-3-VHHb or N1-5-VHHb is sufficient to protect against a lethal challenge (24 h later) with an H5N1 virus. four LD50s of NIBRG-14 (N-14)ma or 6 LD50s of H274Y H5N1 virus. groups of six mice treated with oseltamivir were given 60 g of N1-3-VHHb, 60 g of N1-5-VHHb, 60 g of BL-VHHb, 84 g of N1-3-VHH-Fc, 84 g of N1-7-VHH-Fc a challenge with 4 LD50s of NIBRG-14ma was lethal to all of the mice. all of the mice in the N1-3-VHH-Fc and oseltamivir groups lost body weight until day 7 after the challenge. in the group, only one out of six mice died after the challenge. escape viruses were selected and plaque purified after serial passage of NIBRG-14ma virus in the presence of a dose corresponding to 10 times the IC50 of N1-3-VHHm or N1-5-VHHm. after nine passages, candidate escape mutants were plaque purified and the NA sequences of four (N1-5-VHHm selection) and three (N1-3-VHHm selection) isolated escape viruses were determined. recombinant H5N1 NA suggests that I437 is part of the VHH epitope in NA or stabilizes the conformation of that epitope. a selected escape virus carried an Ile-to-Thr change at position 437. the residues highlighted in red are important for MAb. ELISA plates were coated with 8 HA units of NIBRG-14 or I437T virus. after blocking, incubated with different concentrations of N1-3-VHHm, N1-3-VHHb, N1-5-VHHm, or N1-5-VHHb. the other three plaque-purified viruses that grew in the presence of N1-3-VHHm contained wild-type NA. infection of Sf9 cells with recombinant baculovirus AcNPVN1rec resulted in sialidase activity in the cell supernatant. N1rec protein was purified from the supernatant of infected Sf9 cells. we calculated that purified N1rec had a specific activity of 56,851 NA U/mg. N1-1-VHHm, N1-3-VHHm, N1-5-VHHm, and N1-6-VHHm inhibited the catalytic activity of N1rec. N1-7-VHHm showed approximately 10- to 100-fold lower affinity for N1rec than N1-5-VHHm and N1-3-VHHm respectively. N1-7-VHHm binding to N1rec was not affected by prior incubation of N1rec with N1-3-VHHm or N1-5-VHHm. this suggests that binding of N1-3-VHHm hinders binding of N1-5-VHHm while N1-7-VHHm binds a different epitope. a minus sign indicates binding to the tetramerizing zipper and to N1rec. the amino acid sequences of the NA of NIBRG-14ma are highly homologous, with only 13 amino acid differences. the size of NIBRG-14ma plaques was reduced in a concentration-dependent manner, with IC50s in the low nanomolar range. in contrast, N1-7-VHHm did not affect the size or number of NIBRG-14ma plaques. N1rec inhibition by N1-3-VHHb and N1-5-VHHb was 2,000- and 500-fold stronger than that by the corresponding N1-3-VHHm and N1-5-VHHm formats. in a plaque assay using MDCK cells infected with NIBRG-14ma, both N1-3-VHHb and N1-5-VHHb seemingly had antiviral activities that were comparable to their monovalent counterparts. the llama IgG2c-derived hinge is sensitive to trypsin. shown is Coomassie-stained reducing SDS-PAGE of purified N1-3-VHHm, N1-5-VHHm, N1-3-VHHb, and N1-5-VHHb incubated for 60 min at 37\u00b0C. the n1-3-vhh, n1-5-vhh, and n1-7-vhh genes were fused to the sequence encoding the hinge and Fc tail of mouse IgG2a (n1-vhh-fc) these n1-vhh-fc constructs were cloned into the binary vector Pphas as a T-DNA expression cassette. the best expressors contained VHH-Fc at about 1% of bivalent N1-7-VHH-Fc bound to N1rec in ELISAs. but it failed to inhibit N1rec and the H5N1 viruses in vitro. in vitro NA inhibition and antiviral activity against NIBRG-14ma are enhanced at least 30-fold. N1-3-VHHb, N1-5-VHHb, N1-3-VHH-Fc, and N1-5-VHH-Fc showed about 150-fold higher in vitro antiviral activity than the corresponding monovalent N1-VHHm form against this clade 2 virus. the two NA-inhibitory VHHs inhibit the in vitro replication of representative H5N1 IAV from clades 1 and 2 with comparable efficiency. the three formats of N1-3-VHH evaluated can inhibit the growth of the H5N1 H274Y virus in vitro. both bivalent formats have enhanced in vitro antiviral activity. we tested the antiviral potential of all of the N1-3-VHH and N1-5-VHH formats. N1-3-VHH-Fc, and N1-5-VHH-Fc significantly inhibited NA activity on both substrates. NIBRG-14ma, H5N1 H274Y, and pH1N1 virions were used as substrates. a t test was used to determine the significance of differences between groups. ELISA plates were coated with 8 HA units of NIBRG-14 or A/New Caledonia/20/99 (New Caledonia) virus. after blocking wells were incubated with different concentrations of N1-3-VHHm, N1-3-VHHb, N1-5-VHHm, or N1-5-VHHb as indicated (nanomolar concentration of VHH) in vivo we administered 100 g of N1-3-VHHm, N1-5-VHHm, or N1-7-VHHm intranasally to BALB/c mice 4 h before a challenge with 4 LD50s of NIBRG-14ma. two groups were included as positive controls. all of the N1-VHH-treated groups showed high viral RNA levels 96 h after infection, comparable to those of the PBS-treated group. RT-qPCR results confirm the presence of a high viral titer in the lung homogenates of the treated groups. a SEM N1-3-VHHm 0.094 0.007 N1-5-VHHm 0.096 0.017 N1-7-VHHm 0.095 0.012 SA-VHHm 0.094 0.008 N1-3-VHHb 0.092 0.005 N1-5-VHHb 0.093 0.007 BL-VHHb 0.107 0.024 N1-3-VHH-Fc 0.100 0.020 N1-5-VHH-Fc 0.103 sal administration of 30 g of H5-VHHb and daily oral administration of oseltamivir were included as positive controls. body weight was monitored daily after a challenge and is expressed as a percentage of the initial body weight. the potency of the bivalent formats of the inhibitory N1-VHHs against the tested H5N1 viruses was 30- to 240-fold higher than that of their monovalent counterparts. in vitro results indicated that the potency of the bivalent formats of the inhibitory N1-VHHs against the tested H5N1 viruses was 30- to 240-fold higher than that of their monovalent counterparts. valent formats of N1-5-VHH resulted in a reduction of morbidity. all of the challenged groups, except H5-VHHb-treated mice (no virus detectable), had large and comparable lung virus loads. the lung homogenates treated with bivalent N1-VHH bivalent formats showed 2- to 5-fold decreases in NA activity compared to that of the BL-VHHb (P 0.001)-, GP4-Fc (P 0.05 or P groups of four BALB/c mice were treated intranasally with 60, 12, 2.5, or 0.5 g of N1-3-VHHb or N1-5-VHHb. another group was treated daily by oral administration of oseltamivir. all of the mice in the PBS and BL-VHHb treatment groups died 9 to 10 days after infection. the bacterium-produced N1-VHHb formats protect H5N1-challenged mice against morbidity and death in a dose-dependent way. groups of BALB/c mice (n = 4 per group, except the BL-VHHb, oseltamivir, and PBS groups [n = 3 per group]) were given the indicated amount of N1-VHHb intranasally 24 h before a challenge with 4 LD50 oseltamivir (45 mg/day/kg) was given to a group of three mice by daily gavage starting 24 h before a challenge with 4 LD50s of NIBRG-14ma. the challenge was associated with significant body weight loss for all of the doses and treatments. a single dose of both bivalent formats of N1-3-VHH and N1-5-VHH protects against a challenge with oseltamivir-resistant H5N1. a group was treated by daily oral administration of oseltamivir (1 mg/kg/day) a single intranasal administration of N1-3-VHHb or N1-5-VHHb is sufficient to protect against a lethal challenge (24 h later) with an oseltamivir-resistant H5N1 virus. mice receiving PBS or BL-VHHb died after a challenge with the NIBRG-14ma virus by day 10 after infection. LB/c mice were given 60 g of N1-3-VHHb, 60 g of N1-5-VHHb, 60 g of BL-VHHb, 84 g of N1-5-VHH-Fc, 84 g of N1-7-VHH-Fc, or 84 g of GP4-Fc. treatment with oseltamivir rescued all of the H5N1 H274Y mutant-infected a challenge with 6 LD50s of H5N1 H274Y mutant virus was lethal to all of the mice except those that had been pretreated with NIBRG-14ma. a challenge with 6 LD50s of H5N1 H274Y mutant virus was lethal to all of the mice except those that had been pretreated with N1-3-VHH-Fc (all of the mice survived) candidate escape mutants were plaque purified and the NA sequences of four (N1-5-VHHm selection) and three (N1-3-VHHm selection) isolated escape viruses were determined. one of the escape viruses that were selected with N1-5-VHHm contained a mutation in the NA coding region. this substitution is located on the NA surface, relatively close to the active site. MDCK cells were infected with NIBRG-14ma in the presence of 3.7 M N1-5-VHHm. evidence of resistant viruses was based on a cytopathic effect on infected cells. the sequence was amplified by RT-PCR and sequenced. ELISA plates were coated with 8 HA units of NIBRG-14 or I437T virus. after blocking, incubated with different concentrations of N1-3-VHHm, N1-3-VHHb, N1-5-VHHm, or N1-5-VHHb. the other three plaque-purified viruses that grew in the presence of N1-3-VHHm contained wild-type NA. IgG2b MAb 2B9 directed against clade 1 A/Vietnam/1203/04 NA showed interclade and oseltamivir-resistant mutant NAI activity in vitro. intrasubtype MAbs showed relatively high H1N1 NAI potency (IC50s of 23.6 to 68.1 ng/ml) recombinant NA activities were 316 to 13.5 times lower than our N1-VHHm. recombinant NA activities were 316 to 13.5 times lower than our N1-VHHm. recombinant NA inhibition IC50s ranged from 124 to 2 ng/ml. TMPRSS2-expressing MDCK-based assay allowed us to assess multiple rounds of viral replication in the absence of exogenous trypsin. the antiviral effect of bivalent VHH formats (N1-VHHb and N1-VHH-Fc) was clearly greater than that of monovalent N1-VHHm molecules. a single dose of N1-3-VHHb or N1-5-VHHb protected better than the N1-VHHb formats. conventional MAb 2B9 resulted in only partial (50%) protection against an H5N1 A/Vietnam/1194/2004 challenge. a 10- or 150-fold smaller amount of MAb was required to fully rescue 100% of the H5N1-challenged mice without any boost. anti-RSV Nanobodies give extended protection against viral infection in vivo. the weak, direct antiviral activity of our NA-specific VHHs in vivo model is in line with the paradigm that NA Abs or NA-inhibitory drugs do not prevent infection. mouse IgG2a is one of the most potent Ab isotypes to induce Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity or complement-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. it has an intermediate affinity for FcRIV that is 1 order of magnitude higher than its affinity for the inhibitor receptor FcRIIB (75). plant-produced Abs have been considered a promising and effective alternative for Ab production by recombinant yeast or mammalian cell culture systems. their scalability, robustness, and speed of production are major advantages, even though the glycosylation patterns of the plant-produced Abs are different from those of the Abs produced with mammalian expression platforms. 1 virus for airborne transmission in ferrets, with mutations in HA and PB2, warns of the possibility of human-to-human transmission of zoonotic HPAIV. if HPAIV H5N1 become transmissible among humans, NA targeting could be part of an effective strategy to mitigate disease caused by such a virus."}
