{"summary": "three types of documents were investigated. the first type was the hospitalization registry of Tokyo First Army Hospital. the third type was the medical records of 419 patients at Tokyo First Army Hospital from January 1918 through May 1920. death rates from pneumonia, bronchitis, and influenza during this period were 3.4% (4/116), 0% (0/109), and 0% (0/18) the number of influenza patients suddenly increased to 109 in November, and 9 of them died (8%) reddish pharynx was noted in 105 (85%), coated tongue in 95 (77%), thoracic rale in 71 (57%), facial flush in 24 (19%), conjunctival congestion in 16 (13%) death rate was 6.0% (8/132) in fatal cases, patients died an average of 13.9 days after symptom onset. the only method that can clarify the pathophysiology of Spanish influenza is to investigate the medical records at the time of the pandemic. study of patients in the Japanese Army Garrison hospital in Russia may provide a clue to the conditions of the influenza outbreak in that region. characteristic patients who survived (n = 124) patients who died (n = 8) p value Age, y 22.7 22.8 >0.9 Medical history 31/116 2/8 >0.9 Body temperature at time of hospitalization. one case (at day 79) was excluded. the death rate from Spanish influenza in japan was 1.21%\u20135.29% (11), but the death rate for our study patients was higher. the death rate from influenza is high for patients 65 years of age, but the death rate from Spanish influenza was also reported to be high for persons 20\u201330 years of age. diagnostic test kits, and effective treatment strategies must be developed."}
