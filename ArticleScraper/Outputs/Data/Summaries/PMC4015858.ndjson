{"summary": "the oncogenic HPVs are the primary etiologic agents of cervical cancer. they cause a subset of head and neck, vaginal, vulvar, anal and penile cancers. HPV-16 is the most problematic type as it causes at least half of all cervical cancers. intramuscular (IM) DNA injection has a low efficiency of host cell transduction and encoded antigen expression on its own. delivery is greatly enhanced with immediate electroporation at the injection site. we have previously generated various therapeutic HPV DNA vaccines encoding HPV antigens. we have found linkage to the heat shock protein calreticulin (CRT) in DNA vaccines potently enhances the immune response. pNGVL4a-hCRTE6E7L2 DNA vaccine encoding CRT linked to HPV-16 E6, E7 and L2 proteins (pNGVL4a-hCRTE6E7L2). pNGVL4a-hCRTE6E7L2 DNA vaccine has promise for the treatment of HPV16-associated lesions and to generate a pan-HPV protective effect against new or re-infection. two weeks after the last vaccination, splenocytes and serum were collected from treated mice. IM administration of the CRTE6E7L2 DNA vaccine with electroporation was significantly better for generating HPV antigen-specific CD8+ T cells compared to IM administration of the DNA without electroporation. this was true for both E6 and E7, and was generally consistent between the low and high dose DNA vaccine groups. mice were boosted with the same regimen twice with a 2-week interval. two weeks after last vaccination, serum and splenocytes were collected. IM administration of CRTE6E7L2 DNA vaccine followed by electroporation significantly reduced the intensity of luminescence. c57BL/6 mice were challenged intravaginally with 2x104 TC-1 Luc cells. mice were either left untreated or immunized with 10 g/mouse of CRTE6E7L2 DNA vaccine by intramuscular injection only or followed by electroporation. mice were boosted twice with 3-day interval with the same regimen. IM injection followed by electroporation is the better method of administration for the CRTE6E7L2 DNA vaccine compared to IM injection alone. the vaccine generates potent protective antigen-specific immune responses and antitumor effects against E6/E7-expressing tumors in CD4-depleted mice. mice were depleted of CD4+ T cells by administration of anti-mouse CD4 antibody. the efficiency of CD4+ T cell depletion was verified by peripheral blood CD4 staining followed by flow cytometry analysis. CD4 depleted mice treated with CRTE6E7L2 DNA vaccine had no E7-specific antibody responses compared to nave mice. 5-8 weeks old female mice treated with 200 g/mouse of anti-mouse CD4 depletion antibody (clone GK1.5) or PBS via intraperitoneal injection for 3 days. success of CD4+ T cell depletion was verified by peripheral blood CD4 staining followed by flow cytometry analysis. mice were depleted of CD4+ T cells in the priming phase. mice were challenged with TC-1 tumor cells by tail vein injection. CRTE6E7L2 DNA vaccine could treat TC-1 tumor-bearing mice. 5-8 week old female mice were treated with 100 g/mouse of anti-mouse CD4 deletion antibody (clone GK1.5) or PBS via intraperitoneal injection for 3 days. 5 days after the depletion, mice were injected with 1 105 TC-1 cells intravenously. mice were boosted with the same regimen twice with 1-week interval. two weeks after the last vaccination, splenocytes and serum were collected from treated mice. IM administration of the CRTE6E7L2 DNA vaccine with electroporation was significantly better for generating HPV antigen-specific CD8+ T cells compared to IM administration of the DNA without electroporation. this was true for both E6 and E7, and was generally consistent between the low and high dose DNA vaccine groups. mice were boosted with the same regimen twice with a 2-week interval. two weeks after last vaccination, serum and splenocytes were collected.

CRTE6E7L2 DNA vaccine could treat TC-1 tumor-bearing mice. 5-8 week old female C57BL/6 mice (5 mice/group) were treated with 100 g/mouse of anti-mouse CD4 deletion antibody (clone GK1.5) or PBS via intraperitoneal injection for 3 days. 5 days after the depletion, mice were injected with 1 105 TC-1 cells intravenously. mice were boosted with the same regimen twice with 1-week interval. the use of alum failed to enhance the HPV-specific cellular immune responses elicited by IM vaccination. IM injection of CRTE6E7L2 DNA vaccine followed by electroporation elicited more potent E7-specific CD8+ T cell responses and therapeutic antitumor effects in tumor-bearing mice. a critical safety feature of the CRTE6E7L2 DNA vaccine is that it contains mutated (detox) versions of the E6 and E7 oncogenes. this is essential for the clinical translation of the CRTE6E7L2 DNA vaccine. previously, mutation of E7 at position 24 and/or 26 disrupts the Rb binding site of E7 thus alleviating concerns for the oncogenicity of E7. the use of an electroporation device may be even more important in non-human primates and humans than mice. the CRTE6E7 (detox) DNA vaccine is being tested in HPV-16-associated head and neck cancer patients (NCT01493154) FITC-conjugated anti-mouse CD3 (clone 145-2C11), FITC, PE and APC-conjugated anti-mouse CD8a (clone 53.6.7), and FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IFN-3 (clone XMG1.2) antibodies were purchased from BD Pharmingen (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) pNGVL4a-CRTE6E7L2 contains human calreticulin (CRT), E7 with three mutations [38], E6 with two mutations [38] and deletion of aa146-151 [29] and 11-200aa of HPV16 L2. the digested human CRT and dE6E7L2 were cloned into pNGVL4a vector digested with Sal/BamHI. mice were injected with a depleting anti-mouse CD4 antibody for 3 days. the depletion was maintained through the experiment by injecting the antibody once per week. the success of depletion was confirmed by staining peripheral blood cells with an anti-mouse CD4 antibody. single-cell suspensions from spleens and TC-1-Luc tumors were prepared by meshing spleens and lysing red blood cells. tumors were surgically resected under sterile conditions and placed in RPMI 1640 medium containing 100Uml1 penicillin, 100gml1 streptomycin and incubated at 37\u00b0C with periodic agitation. cells were stained with anti-mouse CD8-FITC, PE-conjugated, HPV16 E7aa49-57 peptide, RAHYNIVTF loaded H2-Db tetramer at 4\u00b0C. cells were acquired with FACSCalibur and analyzed with cellQuest or FlowJo software. intracellular cytokine staining and flow cytometry analysis. 8 days after last vaccination, mice were vaccinated with 5x104 TC-1 cells. tumor growth was monitored by palpation twice a week. in vivo tumor treatment experiment in a hematologic spread model. FITC-conjugated anti-mouse CD3 (clone 145-2C11), FITC, PE and APC-conjugated anti-mouse CD8a (clone 53.6.7), and FITC-conjugated anti-mouse CD4 (clone RM4-4) antibodies were purchased from BD Pharmingen (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). pNGVL4a-CRTE6E7L2 contains human calreticulin (CRT), E7 with three mutations [38], E6 with two mutations [38] and deletion of aa146-151 [29]. pNGVL4a-cRTdE6dE7L2 contains human calreticulin (CRT), E7 with three mutations [38], E6 with two mutations [38] and deletion of aa146- the digested human CRT and dE6E7L2 were cloned into pNGVL4a vector digested with Sal/BamHI. electroporation-mediated DNA vaccination pNGVL4a-CRT/E6E7L2 DNA vaccine was administered to C57BL/6 mice via intramuscular injection. in vitro HPV pseudovirus neutralization assay. 1.5 104 LoVoT cells were plated into 96-well tissue culture plate. the next day, mouse serum was serially diluted and mixed with fcPsV containing luciferase. cells were incubated with serum-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 1mgml1 collagenase D, 100Uml1 penicillin, 100gml1 streptomycin and incubated at 37\u00b0C with periodic agitation. cells were then filtered through a 70-m nylon filter mesh to remove undigested tissue fragments. cells were stained with FITC-conjugated rat anti-mouse CD8a. intracellular IFN-3 was stained with FITC-conjugated rat anti-mouse IFN-3. mice were then vaccinated with 20 g pNGVL4a-CRT/E6E7L2 DNA. mice were vaccinated with 10 g pNGVL4a-CRT/E6E7L2 DNA. mice were injected with 1x105 TC-1 cells intravenously via the tail vein. 3 days later, mice were boosted twice with the same regimen. the terms of these arrangements are managed by Johns Hopkins University in accordance with its conflict of interest policies. authors read and approved the final manuscript. the sequences of the relevant sections of wild type (top) and detox (bottom) HPV-16 E6 and E7 (detox) antigens in pNGVL4a-hCRTE6E7L2 DNA vaccine are shown. letters in red indicate mutations and dashes indicate deletion."}
