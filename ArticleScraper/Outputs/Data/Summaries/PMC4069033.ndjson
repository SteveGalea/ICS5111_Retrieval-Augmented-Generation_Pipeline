{"summary": "parasite species richness in bats is linked to growing number of emerging infectious diseases (EID) [1], [2], [3]\u2013[5], SARS Coronavirus [6] and the newish Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [7]. this trend is linked to biodiversity loss, changes in habitat use and increased habitat fragmentation. the first comparative analysis was performed to test the hypothesis that distribution shape and more specifically the fragmentation of the distribution area, correlate with viral richness in bats. body weight, roosting behaviour and migration were also included in our analysis because of their potential influences on parasite or viral species richness. bats were caught in the Republic of Congo, Gabon, central African Republic (CAR) and Senegal. we used samples collected by previous studies on filovirus in bat populations. the study was conducted using 15 bats species from central and west africa. captures took place at Mbour in 2006 (14\u00b025\u2032 N; 16\u00b057\u2032 E) located about 80 km from dakar, capital of Senegal. mist-nets (122.4 m) were hoisted either in the tree canopy (defined as \u201cfoliage\u201d) or at the entrance of small roosting caves (defined as \u201ccave\u201d) just before twilight. cave 109 Yes 300\u20131000 Hypsignathus monstrosus 5 230 4,357,000 0.53 Foliage 312.5 Yes 25\u2013132 Megaloglossus woermanni 1 49 3,498,000 0.38 Foliage 13.3 Yes - Micropteropus pusillus 5 706 6,704,000 0.37 Foliage 26.1 No 1\u201310 Miniopterus inflatus 3 275 2,423,000 0.53 Cave 9.5 Yes 50 Mops condylurus 4 446 9, we amplified the mitochondrial gene for cytochrome b (cytb) using primer pairs F1 (modified; 5\u2032- CCACGACCAAAAAA-3\u2032) and R1 from Sakai et al.
