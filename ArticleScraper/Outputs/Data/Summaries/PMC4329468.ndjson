{"summary": "Ebolavirus is classified in the family Filoviridae, in order Mononegavirales of single-stranded negative-sense RNA viruses. a fifth ebolavirus, Reston ebolavirus, has infected humans but has not been shown to cause disease. the genus Lloviu cuevavirus (LLOV), found in bats, has no reported infection in humans. positive-stranded viral RNA species for each encoded viral protein are transcribed initially, followed by production of the positive-stranded viral antigenomes. the viral genomes are packaged in the nucleocapsid. they traffic to the cell membrane surface, where the envelope proteins embedded in the cell membrane await and where host envelope budding around the nucleocapsid takes place. bats appear to be the most likely natural reservoir, with several species implicated despite the lack of apparent disease. nonhuman primates (NHPs) including chimpanzees appear to become infected after eating fruit tainted by the body fluids of infected fruit bats. pigs and dogs have been shown to become infected enough to elicit seroconversion in west africa despite any apparent disease. a similar outbreak was occurring at the same time in the Sudan. it was later discovered that the viruses in these outbreaks were distinct. they provide two of the five ebolavirus species, Zaire ebolavirus and Sudan ebolavirus, known today. western aid workers often seen with suspicion by locals, since there is a history of social imbalance in that. there is a history of social imbalance in that, although past epidemics such as the yellow fever outbreak in the 1920s have led to numerous biomedical advances. however, very little benefit has been obtained by the local communities that suffer the greatest loss. the initial incubation period following infection can last up to 14 days. the most common symptom of a progressing disease is severe gastrointestinal illness with vomiting and diarrhea. a common sign of Ebola hemorrhagic fever is the appearance of bleeding from mucous membranes, conjunctiva, or mouth. death of a patient in Texas highlights that the fatality rate is not simply a matter of the standard of care in developing nations vs. those in the united states or Europe. many ebolavirus outbreaks have occurred since the discovery of the virus in 1976. five histological observations in the lung can be made of VHFs. alveolar hemorrhage, pulmonary edema, diffuse alveolar damage, interstitial pneumonitis, and, although much less common, bronchopneumonia. mouse-adapted ebolaviruses show lethality with similar characteristics of innate immune tropism and characteristic disease in the liver leading to coagulopathies and death. similar findings have been made using mouse-adapted ebolaviruses in guinea pigs and hamsters, but the limited reagent available have made these models less desirable. viremia occurs around the onset of signs of disease, remains elevated throughout disease, and can reach viral loads of 106 pfu/ml in the blood (13, 20) viremia occurs generally around the onset of signs of disease, remains elevated throughout disease, and can reach viral loads of 106 pfu/ml in the blood (13, 20) the lack of disease in humans by Reston virus may offer an opportunity to explore mechanisms of disease. the vast majority of information regarding the hematologic and immunologic pathogenesis in Ebola infection has been gleaned from the study. the CDC has established risk factors for determining the exposure risk for monitoring and movement considerations often used for travel and public health actions. the CDC has established risk factors for determining the exposure risk for monitoring and movement considerations often used for travel and public health actions. many myths and misconceptions exist with regard to individual risk. cynomolgus macaques were imported into a quarantine facility infected with Reston virus and became ill. the distance between cages supported the notion of aerosol droplet transmission. the ability to produce infectious droplets and the ability to become infected by droplet transmission would be required. evidence of Ebola in the lung has been reported in both natural human infections and experimental infections by multiple, nonpulmonary routes of inoculation. but the viral load measured by antigen detection and the lung pathology was reported to be stronger in the experimental aerosol transmission study. the findings from the Reston virus outbreak in the NHP facility suggest that both release of infectious exhaled particles and the permissiveness of the respiratory tract are plausible. anticoagulation protein c2 derived from nematodes inhibits Factor VIIa/tissue factor in the coagulation cascade was able to increase survival and mean time to death. despite some success of anticoagulation end points, the overall survival experimentally was minimal. brincidofovir has been shown effective against a number of DNA viruses. the mechanism of action of brincidofovir against RNA viruses is only presumptively thought to be similar. brincidofovir was used under a compassionate use agreement for the treatment of two cases of Ebola in the us. clinical trials of ZMapp are not pending and quantities of the drug required for such trials are awaiting production. two vaccines have received the most attention and utilize a carrier \u201cbackbone\u201d approach to streamline production and increase the safety profile of the vaccine. convalescent serum has been used in the us in cases in which blood typing matches between surviving and infected patients. hemochromatosis, alloimmunization, and transfusion shock are not uncommon adverse outcomes in sickle cell disease therapy by blood transfusion. the current outbreak has created an anxious tension among the populace that has spread to the public health sector. zoonotic outbreaks and the emergence of new pathogens have occurred throughout time. we now get to watch them unfold in front of us by a media apparatus that covets our attention. no conflicts of interest are declared by the author(s)"}
