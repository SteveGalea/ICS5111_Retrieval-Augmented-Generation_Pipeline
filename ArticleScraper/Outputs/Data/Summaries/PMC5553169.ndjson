{"summary": "despite comprehensive vaccination programs, the world health organization estimates that the global disease burden from seasonal influenza results in 1 billion infections, 3 to 5 million cases of severe disease. diverse IAVs are maintained in a wide range of animal species, including swine, dogs, cats, and horses. virus-specific RNAs are recognized by the cytoplasmic PRR retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) (9) and the NOD-like receptor family member LRR and Pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) (6, 10, 11) secreted IFNs act in a paracrine and/or autocrine fashion to induce the expression of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes. the NS1 proteins of some human IAV strains bind to the 30-kDa subunit of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF30), blocking the processing of mRNAs (28\u201331), and to poly(A)-binding protein II (PABPII) the NS1 protein binding site for CPSF30 is centered around amino acid 186. mutations in NS1 amino acids 184 to 188 lead to a virus with NS1 protein from currently circulating pH1N1 viruses has evolved to contain six amino acid mutations (E55K, L90I, I123V, E125D, K131E, and N205S) that restore NS1's ability to bind to CPSF30. a virus encoding the original NS1 protein (pH1N1/NSs-6mut) grew similarly to a virus encoding the original NS1 protein (pH1N1/NSs I123V, E125D, K131E, and N205S were identified in the NS1 protein (NS1-6mut) from these isolates compared to that from pH1N1 A/California/04/2009 circulating at the origin of the 2009 pandemic. the NS1 amino acid changes found in viruses isolated in the Rochester, NY, area are representative of viruses circulating globally. the percentages of strains isolated each season whose NS1 sequences contained the different amino acids at a given position were plotted. the timelines of amino acid changes were different for the different residues. the I123V mutation was the first to appear, and as early as the period of October 2009 to September 2010, more than 90% of the sequences contained this amino acid change. the NS1 protein of currently circulating pH1N1 viruses is able to inhibit general host gene expression. a plasmid encoding the NS1 protein of a pH1N1 virus with the previously described amino acid changes R108K, E125D, and G189D (NS1-3mut) was used as an additional control. expression of the NS1-1918 and NS1-3mut proteins inhibited GFP and Gluc expression. expression of the NS1-wt protein did not efficiently inhibit reporter gene expression. at least 1 of the 6 amino acid changes selected in recently circulating pH1N1 viruses restored the ability of NS1 to inhibit general gene expression. pH1N1 NS1 protein and cellular actin expression levels were analyzed by Western blotting using cell extracts and antibodies specific to the NS1 protein and actin. protein expression in cells transfected with PR8 NS1 was considered 100% for comparison with the levels of expression of the other NS1 variants. levels of fluc were induced to different extents, but always to smaller amounts than those in cells transfected with the empty plasmid. the NS1-PR8 and NS1-wt proteins counteracted ISRE promoter activation to a lesser extent than those with the NS1-1918, NS1-6mut, and NS1-3mut proteins. the NS1-1918, NS1-6mut, and NS1-3mut proteins counteracts host innate immune responses. NS1-6mut and NS1-3mut proteins decrease the amounts of IFN induced after seV infection. human 293T cells were transiently cotransfected using calcium phosphate. at 24 hpt, cells were mock infected or infected (MOI = 3) with the seV cantell strain to induce activation of the ISRE promoter. at 16 hpi, rVSV-GFP expression was quantified in a microplate reader. NS1 protein from currently circulating pH1N1 viruses binds to CPSF30. extracts of human 293T cells transfected with plasmid expressing CPSF30 fused to a FLAG tag or transfected with an empty plasmid were incubated with in vitro-transcribed and -translated NS1-wt or the NS1 protein from currently circulating pH1N1 viruses binds to CPSF30 and shows a subcellular localization similar to that of the NS1-wt protein. transfected 293T cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA plasmids expressing NS1-wt (upper panels) and NS1-6mut (lower panels) proteins. signal for NS1-6mut is consistent with previous data showing that unlike NS1-wt, NS1-6mut inhibits its own gene expression (Fig. 2). Regardless, both NS1-wt and NS1-6mut localized to the nuclei of transfected cells. the 6 amino acid changes in the NS1 protein of currently circulating pH1N1 viruses contribute to the restored ability of NS1 to inhibit general gene expression. the levels of GFP expression correlated well with the levels of Gluc expression, as expected. each of the 6 mutations partially contribute to restoring the ability of the NS1-6mut protein to inhibit general gene expression by the pH1N1 NS1 protein. IAV NS1 has previously been shown to play a significant role in viral pathogenesis in vivo (15, 44, 45) mutations decreasing the ability of NS1 to counteract host innate immune responses have been shown to reduce the virulence of IAV in vivo (46, 47) however, in case of pH1N1 viruses, the virus encoding the three mutations restoring the ability of NS1 to interact with CPSF30 and to inhibit host gene expression (R108 NSs viruses, as well as a wt virus encoding a nonsplit NS segment and wt NS1 (pH1N1-wt) were rescued using previously described plasmid-based reverse genetics approaches. growth of these viruses was determined in canine MDCK and human A549 cells infected at low MOI (0.001 and 0.1, respectively) assay using an anti-nucleoprotein (anti-NP) antibody. at 12 hpi, activation of the IFN- promoter was measured. rNDV-GFP replication was significantly reduced in cells treated with TCS from pH1N1/NSs-wt, pH1N1/NSs-6mut, and pH1N1/NSs-3mut. fected cells compared to those treated with TCS from pH1N1/NSs-6mut- or pH1N1/NSs-3mut-infected cells. infection with pH1N1/NSs-6mut or pH1N1/NSs-3mut inhibited the cellular antiviral state to a larger extent, as previously described for virus-infected cells. titers in TCS from infected cells were determined at the indicated times by immunofocus assay. dotted line indicates the limit of detection (20 FFU/ml). s-3mut pH1N1 viruses further reduce induction of IFN and proinflammatory cytokines. human A549 cells were infected (MOI = 5) with the pH1N1/NSs-wt virus. expression levels of IFN- and IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 2 (IFIT2) were measured at the mRNA level by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) the amino acid changes in the NS1-6mut and NS1-3mut proteins further decrease the ability of the proteins to inhibit IFN responses compared to that of the NS1-wt protein. human lung A549 cells were infected (MOI = 0.1) with the pH1N1/NSs-wt virus, or pH1N1/NSs-6mut. pH1N1/NSs-6mut, pH1N1/NSs-3mut, and pH1N1/NSs-wt viruses were evaluated by qRT-PCR at 12 hpi. levels of expression of C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL10) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) were significantly higher in pH1N1/NSs-wt-infected cells than in pH1N1/NSs-3mut-infected cells. NS1-3 N1/NSs-3mut and pH1N1/NSs-6mut viruses lost a maximum of 5% and 2.5% of body weight, respectively. weight losses were higher, as expected, with the higher dose of 1,000 FFU. with the lower dose, only two mice infected with the pH1N1-wt virus died, whereas all mice infected with the pH1N1-wt virus survived infection. titers in mice infected with three viruses were similar at 2 and 5 dpi. only slightly lower (5-fold) titers were observed at 2 dpi for mice infected with the pH1N1/NSs-3mut virus compared to those for mice infected with the pH1N1/NSs-6mut and pH1N1/NSs-wt virus. d at 2, 5, and 9 dpi, and lungs were harvested, homogenized, and used to quantify viral titers by immunofocus assay. levels of mRNAs encoding IFN-, IFIT2, chemokine (C-C) motif ligand 2 (CCL2), and TNF mRNAs at 9 dpi were higher for pH1N1/NSs-3mut-infected mice than for pH1N1/NSs-6mut- NS1 protein inhibits proinflammatory cytokines, partly due to its CPSF30-binding function (54). levels of proinflammatory cytokine mRNAs, such as those for TNF and CCL2, were significantly lower than those induced by pH1N1/NSs-wt viral infection. mice were sacrificed at 2, 5, and 9 dpi. total RNA was extracted from lungs to quantify levels of IFN- and IFIT mRNAs (A) and CCL2 and TNF mRNAs (B) these NS1 sequences were compared to the publicly available NS1 sequences of human pH1N1 viruses isolated worldwide from October 2015 to September 2016. the percentages of strains isolated each season whose NS1 sequences contained the different amino acids at a given position were plotted (n = 7,027). early as the period of October 2009 to September 2010, more than 90% of the sequences contained this amino acid change. the E55K and K131E mutations appeared next, with more than 95% of the sequences containing that mutation. Interestingly, 100% of the sequences from currently circulating pH1N1 viruses contain these 6 amino acid changes. 1N1 A/California/04/2009 (NS1-wt) does not inhibit general gene expression. human 293T cells were transiently cotransfected with plasmids expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) and Gaussia luciferase (Gluc) plasmids encoding different NS1 variants were used as controls that do not and do block host gene expression. expressing the NS1-6mut protein from currently circulating pH1N1 viruses to levels similar to those for the NS1-1918- or NS1-3mut-transfected cells. these results indicate that at least 1 of the 6 amino acid changes selected in the recently circulating pH1N1 viruses restored the ability of NS1 to inhibit general gene expression. protein expression in cells transfected with PR8 NS1 was considered 100% for comparison with the levels of expression of the other NS1 variants. human 293T cells were transiently cotransfected with plasmids expressing different NS1 proteins and a plasmid expressing firefly luciferase (Fluc) under control of an IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) promoter. NS1-6mut, and NS1-3mut proteins counteract IFN responses. cells were treated with 250 U/ml of universal IFN-. cells were then infected with recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus expressing GFP. levels of GFP expression were higher in cells treated with TCS from mock-infected cells than in cells treated with TCS from seV-infected cells. 1N1 NS1 mutations on IFN responses induced by SeV infection. human 293T cells were transiently cotransfected, using calcium phosphate. plasmid expressing Fluc under control of an ISRE promoter. amino acid mutations in currently circulating pH1N1 viruses restore binding of NS1 to CPSF30. extracts of human 293T cells transfected with a plasmid expressing CPSF30 fused to a FLAG tag or transfected with an empty plasmid were incubated with in vitro-transcribed and -translated NS1-wt or NS1-6mut protein. after coimmunoprecipitation, the CP transfected 293T cells were transfected with pcDNA plasmids expressing NS1-wt and NS1-6mut proteins. the specific signal observed for NS1-wt was more intense than the signal observed for NS1-6mut. NS1-6mut and NS1-6mut localized to the nuclei of transfected cells. 6 amino acid changes in the NS1 protein of currently circulating pH1N1 viruses contribute to the restored inhibition of general gene expression. plasmids encoding single amino acid changes separately in the backbone of NS1-wt and in the backbone of NS1-6mut were generated. levels of Gluc expression were around 10-fold lower in cells transfected with the NS1-6mut plasmid than in cells transfected with the NS1-wt plasmid. each of the 6 mutations partially contribute to restoring the ability of the NS1-6mut protein to inhibit general gene expression. each of the 6 mutations partially contribute to restoring the ability of the NS1-6mut protein to inhibit general gene expression by the pH1N1 NS1 protein. pH1N1 virus encoding the three mutations restoring the ability of NS1 to interact with CPSF30 and to inhibit host gene expression (R108K, E125D, and G189D) compared to pH1N1-wt virus (33), we generated recombinant viruses encoding these NS1 proteins (pH1N1/NSs-wt, pH1N1/NSs-6mut, and pH1N1/NSs-3mut, respectively) titers of the NS split viruses encoding the NS1-wt, NS1-3mut, and NS1-6mut proteins were slightly higher (around 5-fold) at 24 hpi in MDCK cells and at 24, 48, and 72 hpi in A549 cells. however, the titers of the NS split viruses were similar in both cell lines. rNDV-GFP replication was reduced in cells treated with TCS from pH1N1/NSs-wt, pH1N1/NSs-6mut, and pH1N1/NSs-3mut-infected cells. rNDV-GFP replication was significantly reduced in cells treated with TCS from pH1N1/NSs-wt, pH1N1/NSs-6mut, and pH1N1/NSs-3mut. wt virus carrying overlapping NS1 and NEP genes separated by the porcine teschovirus 1 (PTV-1) 2A autoproteolytic cleavage site (48) number indicates amino acid residues changed in currently circulating pH1N1 viruses. viral products from the NS segment (NS1 and NEP) are indicated with white boxes. MDCK cells constitutively expressing GFP and Fluc reporter genes were infected (MOI = 5) with the pH1N1/NSs-wt, pH1N1/NSs-6mut, or pH1N1/NSs-3mut virus. the levels of viral infection were determined by immunofluorescence assay using an antibody specific for viral NP (A) expression levels of IFN- and IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 2 (IFIT2) were measured at the mRNA level by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) mRNA levels of IFN- and IFIT2 were higher (around 2.5-fold) in pH1N1/NSs-wt-infected A549 cells than in pH1N1/NSs-6mut- or pH1N1/NSs-3mut-infected A549 human lung A549 cells were infected (MOI = 5) with the pH1N1/NSs-wt, pH1N1/NSs-6mut, or pH1N1/NSs-3mut virus. levels of mRNAs for IFN- (A), IFIT2 (B), CXCL10 (D) and TNF (E) were determined by qRT-PCR. NS1-3mut and NS1-6mut further decrease the induction of proinflammatory cytokines compared to that with the NS1-wt protein. mice (n = 5) were infected intranasally (i.n.) with 100 focus-forming units (FFU) of the pH1N1/NSs-wt, pH1N1/NSs-6mut, pH1N1/NSs-3mut, or pH1N1-wt virus. only two mice infected with the pH1N1-wt virus died. pH1N1/NSs-3mut, pH1N1/NSs-3mut, and pH1N1/NSs-6mut viruses survived infection. at the higher dose, 20%, 20%, and 100% of the mice infected with the pH1N1-wt virus succumbed to the infection. at 9 dpi, we could detect viral titers for only 1 of 3 mice infected with the pH1N1/NSs-6mut or pH1N1/NSs-wt virus. these data suggest that the pH1N1/NSs-6mut and pH1N1/NSs-wt viruses replicate similarly. the attenuation observed for the pH1N1/NSs-6mut virus is likely not due to differences in virus replication. levels of mRNAs encoding IFN-, IFIT2, chemokine (C-C) motif ligand 2 (CCL2), and TNF were evaluated in mouse lungs at 2, 5, and 9 dpi by qRT-PCR. pH1N1/NSs-wt virus induced higher expression levels of IFN- and IFIT2 at 2 and 5 dpi than those with the pH1N1/NSs-6mut and pH1N1/NSs-3mut levels of CCL2 and TNF mRNAs were lower in pH1N1/NSs-6mut- and pH1N1/NSs-wt-infected mice. these effects were most likely due to the restoration of NS1's CPSF30-binding function. NS1 mutations restore the ability to inhibit general gene expression. DISCUSSION Interaction of the IAV NS1 protein with CPSF30 blocks the processing of cellular mRNAs, leading to inhibition of general gene expression. however, this binding property is not conserved in all IAV NS1 proteins. NS1 proteins of 1918 (H1N1) and currently circulating H3N2 IAVs bind CPSF30 and inhibit general host gene expression. CPSF30 for the PR8, pH1N1, H7N9, H5N1, and seasonal H3N2 IAVs. the naturally occurring mutations E55K, L90I, I123V, E125D, K131E, and N205S each partially contribute to the restored ability of pH1N1 NS1 to inhibit host gene expression. the mutation at residue 55 has an effect only in the backbone of the NS1-6mut protein. Residues 55 and 205 are not in the region of the crystallized NS1. residues 90 and 131 are not close to the CPSF30-binding sites. residues 90, 123, 125, and 131 are not close to the CPSF30-binding sites. 189 artificially introduced into the pH1N1 virus NS1 protein to restore NS1-CPSF30 binding (33) (B), are indicated in red. blocking NS1-mediated inhibition of host gene expression in an H3N2 seasonal virus led to virus attenuation. the pH1N1/NSs-6mut virus grew to titers similar to those of the pH1N1/NSs-wt virus in mouse lungs. the induction of proinflammatory cytokines was higher in mice infected with the pH1N1/NSs-wt virus than in mice infected with the pH1N1/NSs-3mut virus. this correlates with the virulence observed for these viruses. both pH1N1 isolates were more virulent due in part to differences in the host transcriptional response during acute infection (58) pathogenicity is significantly due to the cytokine storm induced during infection (59) the lower levels of induction of proinflammatory cytokine expression after infection with the pH1N1/NSs-6mut and pH1N1/NSs-3mut viruses are a likely explanation. the cDNAs were amplified by PCR using platinum Pfx polymerase (Life Technologies) and the same VS and RS primers. the cDNAs were amplified by PCR using the same VS and RS primers. RNAs extracted from nasal washes/swabs from patient ACU001 and from MDCK cells infected with pH1N1 were used for RT reactions. overlapping PCRs using Platinum Pfx polymerase (Life Technologies) and the primers and template cDNAs described in Table 2 were used to amplify the viral NS1 protein. to abolish NS mRNA splicing, two silent mutations were introduced, at nt 501 and 50 NS1 ORFs were amplified by using the pcDNA3-HA NH2-NS1-6mut and -NS1-3mut plasmids as templates and the primers NS1-EcoRI-NS1cal-VS and NS1cal-AgeI-RS.
