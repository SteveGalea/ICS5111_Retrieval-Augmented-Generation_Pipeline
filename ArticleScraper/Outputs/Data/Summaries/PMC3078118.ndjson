{"summary": "cloned B cells were immortalized by expressing an active mutant of the transcription factor signal transducer and Activator of Transcription 5. active STAT5 inhibits the differentiation of B cells while increasing their replicative life span. novel technologies have been developed, including humanization of mouse antibodies, phage display of human B cell libraries, single cell PCR technologies and the creation of mice that express human immunoglobulin genes. the human immune system itself can safely be assumed to be the best in generating highly efficacious antibodies. such antibodies may have a better safety profile than antibodies derived from mice. STAT5bERpos B cells preserve capacity to produce immunoglobulins. ectopic expression of active STAT5 mutants in human primary B cells results in a block in B cell differentiation. we investigated whether we could exploit the immortalizing capacity of active STAT5 mutants to obtain human monoclonal B cell lines. secreted immunoglobulin levels in the supernatant of the CA-STAT5bER B cells were measured over time. around 3 to 4 weeks after transduction the level of secreted IgG started to decrease for the tamoxifen/IL-2 plus IL-4 and tamoxifen/IL-21 cultured cells. we cultured the cells with tamoxifen, IL-2 and IL-4 until immunoglobulin production had vanished and then removed tamoxifen from the culture. when treated with IL-21, IgM or IgG immunoglobulin secretion resumed. after approximately 14 days antibody production came to an end. cell lines from STAT5bERpos memory B cells can be obtained from clonal cultures. TT is produced by the gram-positive bacterium Clostridium tetani. infants are routinely vaccinated with a combination vaccine against diphtheria. rTT.Cpos CD27pos memory B cells were isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy donors and cultured on CD40L-L cells in the presence of IL-21. after 36 hrs the cells were transduced with STAT5bER-IRES-GFP and cultured again on CD40L-L cells, now in the presence of IL-2, IL-4 and tamoxifen. IgM and C) IgG ELISA performed on supernatants derived from the rTT.Cpos STAT5bERpos memory B cell clones cultured with IL-2, IL-4 plus tamoxifen (4HT) or with IL-21 alone. donor number of positive clones from 96 wells Total # from 1 c/w from 5 c/w from 10 c/w A 12/96 2 10 N.D. rTT.C sorted STAT5bERpos clones are monoclonal and have undergone somatic hypermutation [28] and affinity maturation. the cells have undergone somatic hypermutation [28] and affinity maturation, the mechanisms via which they become able to develop high affinity antibodies. STAT5bERpos B cells preserve capacity to produce immunoglobulins. previously we have published that ectopic expression of active STAT5 mutants in human primary B cells results in a block in B cell differentiation. we extended these findings by showing that constitutive activation of STAT5 in B cells led to loss of antibody surface expression. IL-2 and IL-4 induce proliferation of human primary B cells. the secreted immunoglobulin levels in the supernatant of the CA-STAT5bER B cells were measured over time. around 3 to 4 weeks after transduction the level of secreted IgG started to decrease. we cultured the cells with tamoxifen, IL-2 and IL-4 until immunoglobulin production had vanished and then removed tamoxifen from the culture. when treated with IL-21, IgM or IgG immunoglobulin secretion resumed. after approximately 14 days antibody production came to an end. stable STAT5bERpos memory B cells can be obtained from clonal cultures. TT is produced by the gram-positive bacterium Clostridium tetani. memory B cells specifically directed against TT can be detected using PE-conjugated recombinant TT C-Fragment (rTT.C) cells were isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy donors and cultured on CD40L-L cells in the presence of IL-21. after 36 hrs the cells were transduced with STAT5bER-IRES-GFP and cultured again on CD40L-L cells. rTT.Cpos STAT5bERpos memory B cells were first sorted for rTT.C and CD27 before being transduced with STAT5bER. IgM and C) IgG ELISA performed on supernatants derived from the rTT.Cpos STAT5bERpos memory B cell clones cultured with IL-2, IL-4 plus tamoxifen (4HT) or with IL-21 alone. donor number of positive rTT.C sorted STAT5bERpos clones are monoclonal and have undergone somatic hypermutation [28] and affinity maturation. for this reason we determined the mutation status of TT specific STAT5bERpos memory B cell lines from one donor. from this one donor, we obtained three independent immunoglobulin sequences \u2013 one IgG and one IgM sequence. inducible active STAT5 mutant can be used to obtain human, antigen-specific, monoclonal B cell lines, which have the capacity to undergo plasma cell differentiation. by making use of memory B cells isolated from healthy donors we could screen for B cells that have been positively selected for high affinity against a specific antigen. ulin expression by primary B cells transduced with STAT5bER is dependent on activation of STAT5. the transduced B cells only secrete antibody when STAT5b-ER is inactivated. this occurs at least partly through upregulation of Blimp-1 by STAT3 activation. TT specific antibodies selected through binding assays (ELISA) are functional as shown in a Toxin Binding Inhibition test (ToBI) and in in vivo TT challenge models in mice [43] [44]. an obvious next step would be to scale up the production of antibodies through recombinant expression of the identified immunoglobulin genes in suitable cell lines. CD19 MACS-selected B cells were subsequent sorted for CD3negCD19posCD27pos, CD3negCD19possIgGpos or CD3negCD19possIgGpos TTpos. mAbs against the human molecules CD3 (SK7), CD19 (SJ25C1), IgG (G18-145) were directly labeled with either fluoroscein isothiocyanate (FITC), phy vector upstream to a internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) and a marker gene (a signaling-incompetent mutant of NGFR; provided by C. Bonini, St. Raphael Hospital, Milan, Italy or GFP) cells were transduced with retroviruses after activation on CD40L-L cells in the presence of recombinant mouse IL-21 (25 ng/ml; R&D systems) for 36 hrs. to detect Tetanus Toxin we used the ELISA Ridascreen Tetanus (r-biopharm AG, Darmstadt, Germany) Total RNA was isolated from approximately 5105 B cells with Trizol (Invitrogen) cDNA was generated and subjected to PCR to produce heavy chain fragments using 1 U AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems Inc.) CD27 (O323; eBioscience) and IgA (f(ab)2, DAKO) were directly labeled with either fluoroscein isothiocyanate (FITC), phycoerythrin (PE), phycoerythrin cyanine 5, (PE-Cy5), allophycocyanin (APC), phycoerythrin-indotricarbocyanine (PE-Cy7), phy cell culture B cells (2105) were co-cultured on -irradiated (100 Gy) mouse L cell fibroblasts stably expressing CD40L (CD40L-L cells, 105 well) and recombinant human IL-2, IL-4 or IL-21. cells were routinely tested by PCR for the presence of mycoplasma and EBV. PCR products were run on agarose gels, purified and cloned into the pCR2.1 TA cloning vector according to manufacturers' recommendations (Invitrogen) Sequence analysis was performed using BigDye Terminator chemistry (Applied Biosystems Inc.) and Vector-NTI software (Invitrogen). Consensus sequences were determined with Codon code (CodonCode Corporation). multiple TT specific clones were in culture for more then 5 months and subsequent frozen. they were then thawed and taken in culture again with CD40L, IL-2, IL-4 and tamoxifen (4HT). an ELISA was performed to determine IgG and IgM concentrations."}
