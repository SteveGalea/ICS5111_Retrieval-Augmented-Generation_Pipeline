{"summary": "the genus Pestivirus is contained within the family Flaviviridae. it includes positive, single-stranded RNA viruses with 12 kb genomes. polyprotein encodes a polyprotein flanked by 5\u2032- and 3\u2032- untranslated regions (UTRs) pestiviruses can infect a variety of artiodactylous hosts, including swine and ruminants. diseases associated with pestiviruses include hemorrhagic symptoms, abortion, respiratory disease, and fatal mucosal disease. BVDV and CSFV are severely pathogenic in cattle and swine, respectively. bats (Order Chiroptera) and rodents (Order Rodentina) are two of the most widely geographically distributed mammals and display the most extensive species diversity. they are also considered to be major natural hosts of a large variety of viruses. covering 50 species were sampled by obtaining both pharyngeal and anal swabs between October 2010 and July 2017 throughout China. all bats and rodents collected in this study were considered to be apparently healthy. reads classified into the same virus family or genus with MEGAN 5 were extracted. the accurate loci of each reads and the relative distance between reads were determined based on the alignment results obtained with MEGAN 5. the accession numbers for the four bat pestiviruses are MH282908\u2013MH282911. the GA II sequence data have been deposited into the NCBI sequence reads archive (SRA) the extracted RNA and DNA were amplified using sequence-independent PCR. amplified viral nucleic acid libraries were then sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq2500 sequencer. the raw sequence reads were then filtered using previously described criteria to obtain valid sequences. genome walking kit (TaKaRa), 5\u2032 RACE kit (Invitrogen) and 3\u2032 full RACE core set, version 2.0 (TaKaRa) polyproteins were deduced by comparing them with sequences in other pestiviruses. a total of 15,164 sequence reads of 81\u2013100 bp were classified into the genus Pestivirus based on the NR alignment results generated with MEGAN5. these reads showed 31\u201368% amino acid (aa) identity with known pestiviruses in the GenBank database. two bat species and four rodent species from four provinces were found to be pestivirus-positive. provinces with pestivirus-related reads are labeled in green and aqua. the animal species from each province is noted in red to the right of the map. the full-length genome of strain BtSk-PV-1/GX2017 was sequenced and yielded an 11,921 nt genome that encoded a 3,618 aa polyprotein. the polyprotein of these four pestiviruses shared 65% aa identity with RaPestV-1, 59% aa identity with APPV from Pestivirus K and 35% aa identity with pestiviruses of rodents and other hosts. each peptide of BPV species 1 and 2 aligned best with those of APPV. the non-structural autoprotease protein of BPV species 1 was predicted to be self-cleaved from the polyprotein between Cys176 and Ser177. strain RtAp-PV/JL2014, identified in A. peninsulae from jilin had a 12,768 nt genome, encoding a 3,989 aa polyprotein. RtNc-PV/HuB2014, which was found in N. confucianus from Hubei had a 13,220 nt genome, encoding a 4,023 aa polyprotein. PV/SAX2015, and RtNe-PV/SC2014 had 68, 69, and 77% aa identities to each other, respectively. the remaining two RPVs showed 93% aa identity to each other, 80% aa identity to that of NRPV, and 40% aa identity to BPVs and other pestiviruses. the most divergent regions of RPVs showed only 31\u201363% aa identity with P7 of NRPV. the conserved Npro catalytic residues were identified in both RPVs. the self-cleavage site for Npro of RPV species 2\u20134 is between Cys and Asn. viruses under the artiodactylous lineage tend to be inconsistent with host phylogenies. diverse bovine and swine pestiviruses were scattered in genus Pestivirus with much higher genetic diversity than pestiviruses of other host species. a total of 15,164 sequence reads of 81\u2013100 bp were classified into the genus Pestivirus based on the NR alignment results generated with MEGAN5. these reads showed 31\u201368% amino acid (aa) identity with known pestiviruses in the GenBank database. two bat species and four rodent species from four provinces were found to be pestivirus-positive. ivirus-positive in both pharyngeal and anal swab samples. provinces with pestivirus-related reads are labeled in green and aqua. the animal species from each province is noted in red to the right. the full-length genome of strain BtSk-PV-1/GX2017 was sequenced and yielded an 11,921 nt genome that encoded a 3,618 aa polyprotein. the polyprotein of these four pestiviruses shared 65% aa identity with RaPestV-1, 59% aa identity with APPV from Pestivirus K and 35% aa identity with pestiviruses of rodents and other hosts. BPV species 1 and 2 aligned best with those of APPV species 1 and 2. each mature peptide had very low aa sequence identity when compared with those of other pestiviruses. strain RtAp-PV/JL2014, identified in A. peninsulae from jilin had a 12,768 nt genome, encoding a 3,989 aa polyprotein. RtNc-PV/HuB2014, which was found in N. confucianus from Hubei had a 13,220 nt genome, encoding a 4,023 aa polyprotein. tAd-PV/SAX2015, and RtNe-PV/SC2014) had 68, 69, and 77% aa identities to each other. the polyproteins of the remaining two RPVs showed 93% aa identity to each other, 80% aa identity to that of NRPV and 40% aa identity to BPVs and other pestiviruses. peptides were the most divergent regions of RPVs, as they showed only 31\u201363% aa identity with P7 of NRPV. the conserved Npro catalytic residues were identified in both RPVs. the self-cleavage site for Npro of RPV species 2\u20134 is between Cys and Asn. viruses under the artiodactylous lineage tend to be inconsistent with host phylogenies. diverse bovine and swine pestiviruses were scattered in genus Pestivirus with much higher genetic diversity than pestiviruses of other host species. many viral causative agents of human and domestic animal diseases, including severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus, henipaviruses, hantaviruses, and arenaviruses, are widely recognized as having originated or been transmitted from wild bat or rodent hosts. atypical porcine pestivirus, APPV, caused piglet CT A-II in Europe and North America. a large volume of wildlife virome data has been obtained in the past decade. a predictive analysis revealed that the viral richness in wildlife is somewhat limited. there is still a large number of potentially zoonotic viruses. the close relationship between APPV and BPVs indicates the presence of a much closer common ancestor of APPV in bats than in other swine pestiviruses. pestiviruses can cross species barriers to infect a wide range of artiodactylous animals."}
