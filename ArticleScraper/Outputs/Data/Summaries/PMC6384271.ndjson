{"summary": "acute viral infection is thoroughly eliminated by the orchestration between both innate and adaptive immune cells. certain types of viruses can effectively evade immune system and persist at a certain level in the host for long time. the Th1 subset leaves the lymph node and travels to sites of infection. they function through secreting IL-2, IFN- and TNF and are responsible for many typical cell-mediated effects. in contrast, virus-specific Tfh cells are endowed with the ability of migrating into B cell follicles in response to chemokine CXCL13. pTfh consist of two parts: \u201ceffector\u201d pTfh and \u201cresting\u201d pTfh cells. they found that CCR7loPD-1hiCXCR5+ CD4+ T cells express large amounts of IL-21, a key cytokine secreted by Tfh cells to support GC responses. this review focuses on the current understanding of the fate commitment, functional maturation, and memory formation of Tfh cells during acute viral infection. authors discuss the potential in boosting viral-specific Tfh cells for improving efficacies of anti-viral vaccines. T cells carrying high affinity TCRs can form long dynamic immune synapses with DC. secreted cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-21 also contribute to Tfh differentiation. IL-2 suppresses the upregulated expression of Bcl6, which is the master regulator of Tfh differentiation. deficient in TCF-1 expression almost failed in Tfh differentiation. Tfh cells exhibited lower expression of Id2 than that of Th1 cells during acute viral infection and knockdown of Id2. the differentiation of Tfh cells was impaired in Egr2 and Egr3 deficient mice post viral infection because of the defective expression of Bcl-6. the overexpression of Bcl-6 in EGR2/3-deficient CD4+ T cells partially rescued the differentiation of Tfh cells and GC formation. two mainly functions in the late stage of Tfh differentiation, promoting a Tfh transcriptional program and migratory ability toward B cell follicles (50). in mouse models, the ligand for CXCR5, CXCL13 is mainly expressed by stromal cells but not Tfh cells (6, 51) in humans, however, CXCL13 is primarily generated by Tfh cells, which may promote recruiting GC B cells to the light zone. SLAM-associated protein (SAP) expressed by Tfh cells is critical for the formation of germinal centers (57, 58) after viral infection, SLAM-associated protein (SAP) expressed by Tfh cells is critical for the formation of germinal centers (57, 58), where Tfh cells facilitate the generation of long-lived memory B cells and plasma cells that produce virus-specific antibodies. defective Tfh cell number and damaged Tfh function can lead to impaired GC response. ERT2cre conditional knockout mice combine mature Tfh cells adoptive transfer strategy to determine their \u201chelp\u201d ability in promoting the formation of GC and plasma cells. GC Tfh cells can differentiate into long-lived memory-type cells. these cells are endowed with capacity to reboost Tfh-specific effector functions when encountered with the same antigen (76) they can continuously enter a different GC or exit GC and emigrate to neighboring follicles (77, 78) memory Tfh cells maintain a substantial level of CD40L (84) and are retained in the draining lymph nodes for more than 6 months (85). memory Tfh cells maintain a substantial level of CD40L (84) and are retained in the draining lymph nodes for more than 6 months (85). virus-specific CD4+ T cells in LCMV clone 13 persistent infection model exhibit deficiency in production of Th1-type effector cytokines. loss of CD4+ T cell's ability to respond to persistent antigens may be due to high levels of antigens at the priming stage (90) and appears not to be regulated by changes in APCs caused by chronic viral pathogens. these additional Tfh-like CD4+ T cells are proven to have the ability to help B cells through in vitro culture. this suggests that they are equipped with some key signatures of conceptual Tfh cells and remain suboptimal functions. this suggests that they are equipped with some key signatures of conceptual Tfh cells. IL-21, canonical Tfh cytokine important for CD8+ T cell function in chronic viral infection (107\u2013110), is increased within Tfh population. however, it seems that B cell could not get optimal help from increased Tfh in chronic LCMV infection. Tfh cells located in B-cell follicles are preferentially targeted by HIV virus to form long-term latent infection and the enduring generation of virulent particles. the anatomical separation of latently infected Tfh cells might represent a major barrier for HIV-specific CD8+ T cells to effectively eradicate HIV infection. pTfh cells related to germinal center Tfh cells are resting CD45RO+PD-1+CXCR5+CXCR3CD4+ T cells. the frequency of this population positively correlates with the titers of HIV-specific antibodies in a large cohort of HIV-infected patients. functionally impaired CD4+ T cells derived from HIV patients exhibit significant enhancement in proliferative potential after treatment targeting on CTLA-4 (129, 130), TIM3 (131) or PD-1 signaling blockade (132) in vitro. findings shed new light on the design of vaccines against chronic viral infections. the -herpesviruses (Gammaherpesviruses) are associated with lymphoproliferative diseases and lymphomas and with the majority establishing latency in B lymphocytes. intranasal infection of mice with the murine -herpesvirus (MHV-68, shares biological and genetic homology with EBV) results in an acute lytic infection in the lung followed by the establishment of lifelong latency in memory B cells, dendritic cells cytotoxic T cells expressed high level of the chemokine receptor CXCR5 (Tfc, Follicular cytotoxic T cells), which selectively entered B cell follicles and eradicated infected Tfh cells and B cells during HIV/SIV or EBV infection. mTOR acts to drive glycolysis and lipogenesis and subsequently promotes Tfh cell responses during acute viral infection. memory Tfh cells may have distinct metabolic features influenced by unique cellular and nutritional contact within each microenvironment. differentiation of Tfh cells and other CD4+ T helper (Th) cells are strongly correlated with specific epigenetic modifications (146, 147) ethics Statement All of our studies were specifically reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the Third Military Medical University. authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
