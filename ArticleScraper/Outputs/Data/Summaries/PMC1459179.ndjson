{"summary": "despite this challenge, professional codes of ethics are silent on the issue of duty to care during communicable disease outbreaks. it is of pressing importance that organizations representing HCPs give clear indication of what standard of care is expected of their members in the event of a pandemic. avian flu threatens to be more widespread than SARS, with the potential to become a truly global pandemic. avian flu threatens to be more widespread than SARS, with the potential to become a truly global pandemic. many HCPs performed their jobs admirably under considerable stress and significant personal risk. many acted in a supererogatory manner during the SARS outbreak. many acted in a supererogatory manner during the outbreak. the issue of duty to care has emerged as a matter of paramount concern among health care professionals, hospital administrators, public policy makers, and bioethicists. the ethical foundations of the duty to care are grounded in several longstanding ethical principles. the principle of beneficience recognizes and defines the special moral obligation on the part of HCPs to further the welfare of patients and to advance patients' well-being. the profession is legitimated by social contract and therefore its members should be available in times of emergency. it is a reasonable and legitimate expectation by the public that HCPs will respond in an infectious disease emergency. a code that is too vague can render it ineffectual and irrelevant. an informative and comprehensible code of ethics has numerous tangible benefits. a detailed treatment of the issue in professional codes of ethics would also serve to increase awareness and comfort levels. the AMA has adopted several new ethics policies that focus specifically on the medical profession's obligations and responsibilities in the context of an infectious disease outbreak. despite the seemingly fortuitous timing of the publication, the revised Code is, quite astoundingly, altogether silent on physicians' duty to care. despite the seemingly fortuitous timing of the publication, the revised Code is, quite astoundingly, altogether silent on physicians' duty to care. the AMA has taken a step in the right direction by stating the obligations of its members. it remains to be seen whether other national medical associations and other health care professions will follow suit and redress the silence of codes of ethics on the duty to care. codes of ethics can be seen as reflections of enduring professional values. there is no current consensus as to how explicitly and stringently the requirements for the duty to care should be stated. a survey of 1000 american physicians found mixed views on whether they would continue to care for patients in the event of an outbreak. aaron miller: the current silence of codes of ethics is greatly problematic, both clinically and normatively. there is presently a need to address the professional duties of HCPs to their patients with the risks to the well-being of society. a number of options are open to the professions. a number of options are open to the professions. a position statement to that effect issued by the Ontario Medical Association could be justified if the professions expressed a strong commitment to the ethical duty to provide care during public health emergencies. a first step would be for the professional colleges to create a forum to engage their memberships and encourage the exchange of views on the issue. such statements should be made publicly available in order to encourage sustained dialogue on the issues raised by professional colleges. many HCPs performed their jobs admirably under considerable stress and significant personal risk. many acted in a supererogatory

of paramount concern among health care professionals, hospital administrators, public policy makers, and bioethicists [11-14] the ethical foundations of the duty to care are grounded in several longstanding ethical principles. the principle of beneficience recognizes and defines the special moral obligation on the part of HCPs to further the welfare of patients and to advance patients' well-being. by freely choosing a profession devoted to care of the ill, health care professionals have assumed risk Arguably, HCPs have consented to greater than average risk by their very choice of profession. any informed reading of the medical literature in the last 20 years has shown that infectious diseases remain ubiquitous. the profession is legitimated by social contract and therefore its members should be available in times of emergency. it is a reasonable and legitimate expectation by the public that HCPs will respond in an infectious disease emergency. there is a strong claim for a social contract between the profession and society. a detailed treatment of the issue in professional codes of ethics would also serve to increase awareness and comfort levels. a detailed treatment of the issue in professional codes of ethics would also serve as norms of standards recognizable and enforceable by law. codes of ethics also serve as potent forms of symbolic communication to the public that is served by the professions. the key revision in the 2004 edition of the CMA Code was the addition of the following item to the 'Fundamental Responsibilities' section. this addition does little to address, in any substantively meaningful way, the duty to care obligations of HCPs in the context of an infectious disease outbreak. the AMA has adopted several new ethics policies that focus specifically on the medical profession's obligations and responsibilities in the context of an infectious disease outbreak. codes of ethics can be seen as reflections of enduring professional values. they are also clearly influenced by and are the product of historical circumstances. the retrenchment has been linked to the rise of government and corporate intrusions into medical practice. a 2003 survey of 1000 american physicians found mixed views on the duty to care. authors conclude there should be a reinforcement of \"the [medical] profession's ethical duty to treat\" in the event of a public health crisis. this statement may indeed be considered too strong and too categorical by many today. the content of current professional codes of ethics offers little guidance or reflection of consensus in the health care community. a number of options are open to the professions. one option, which we have already argued is unacceptable, would be to remain silent. a first step would be for the professional colleges to create a forum to engage their memberships and encourage the exchange of views on the issue. such statements should be made publicly available in order to encourage sustained dialogue on the issues raised by professional colleges. a next step would be to foster public debate and dialogue on the positions taken by the various health care professions. the time to address the ethical duty to provide care is at hand. abbreviations HCPs (health care professionals); HCWs (health care workers); CMA (Canadian Medical Association); AMA (American Medical Assocation).
