{"summary": "patients patient 1, 73, returned from Reunion on february 17, 2006. he was admitted for a 3-day history of fever and arthralgia. clinical signs included asthenia, anorexia, nausea, myalgia, headache, bilateral conjunctivitis. patient 3 was a 31-year-old woman who had been living in Marseilles since 1987. she was admitted with fever, nausea, myalgia, lumbar pain, headache, bilateral conjunctivitis, and severe bilateral arthralgia (shoulders, knees, knees, knees, knees, knees, knees, knees, knees, knees, knees, knees. laboratory findings included negative blood smears for malaria, anemia and lymphopenia (0.6109 cells/L) blood chemistry values were within normal limits except for raised enzymes (177 IU/L AST, 116 IU/L ALT, 780 IU/L LDH), hypocholesterolemia (3.5 mmol/L), and CRP (64 mg/L). the patient was discharged, although still in pain. CHIKV-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM were tested in acute- and convalescent-phase sera by an indirect fluorescent antibody test. a hyperimmune mouse ascitic fluid prepared against a CHIKV Ross strain in conjunction with a fluorescein isothiocyanate\u2013conjugated goat anti-human strain. a 1,044-nt sequence of the E1 gene was used for comparative genetic analysis of sequences from Indian Ocean CHIKV and reference strains from diverse geographic and temporal origins. a 1,044-nt sequence of the E1 gene was used for comparative genetic analysis of sequences from Indian Ocean CHIKV and reference strains from diverse geographic and temporal origins. the 4 Indian Ocean strains had a common ancestor, constituted a new sublineage that is distinct from the 4 lineages previously recognized. two mutations consist of A1028V and D1086E substitutions with reference to all other CHIKV strains characterized to date, regardless of evolutionary lineage. the outbreak of chikungunya fever in 2005 in the Comoros Islands led to the first documented CHIKV infections imported into France by travelers who had visited the islands. the patients reported here had typical clinical signs and symptoms of CHIKV infection, including febrile polyarthritis with papular, macular, or purpuric rashes. high viremia was observed in this study (up to 3.3109 copies/mL), which enabled virus isolation from all viremic patients. RNA was quantified by spectrophotometry, diluted serially from 100 to 10\u201314. the 4 highest dilutions that provided a positive result were included in each diagnostic experiment. a major determinant of outbreak dynamics is the ecological cycle of the virus and its vector. this cycle in Reunion probably follows a denguelike model characterized by the absence of an animal reservoir and the ability to spread rapidly among humans through peridomestic mosquito bites. CHIKV may become similarly globalized. if viremic patients arrive in Italy, France, or elsewhere in southern Europe during the summer, they could cause a European outbreak. the risk may also exist in the Americas, where the Asian tiger mosquito is prevalent. the color of the stars reflects the main evolutionary lineages shown in Figure 3."}
