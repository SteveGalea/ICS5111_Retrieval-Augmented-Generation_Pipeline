{"summary": "influenza viruses are zoonotic pathogens that infect poultry such as chickens, turkeys, ducks, and geese. 2, 4, 5 Surveillance for influenza viruses within live bird markets (LBMs) has been recognized as an effective tool for detecting circulating influenza subtypes in the poultry population. the risk assessment identified complex marketing chains of poultry involving multiple middle men and markets coupled with unsatisfactory levels of biosecurity along the poultry chain. the risk assessment identified complex marketing chains of poultry involving multiple middle men and markets as important factors that could contribute to the spread and transmission of influenza viruses. in the fifth market, Nyambari, birds were not kept in cages during the day. at night, the birds were driven to a shelter located 500 m from the market. the markets sell live poultry for restocking to farmers and for slaughter. Specimens were labeled and transported at 4\u00b0C to the KEMRI/CDCK laboratory. the questionnaire included questions about the number and types of birds in each market, whether the markets had been cleaned using disinfectants, the presence of rodents and wild birds. data management and analysis Data were entered and stored in an MS Access database. descriptive statistics on number of birds sold, suppliers, and length of stay of birds were calculated. the markets are among the largest poultry markets in the country. poultry slaughter is carried out within the market premises. no slaughtering occurs at the other three markets. an oropharyngeal (OP) and a cloacal (CL) swabs collected from 25 birds. total RNA was isolated from 100 l of each cloacal and environmental specimen. rt RTPCR machine was set to run at 10 minutes at 45\u00b0C for reverse transcription. half (55%) of the chickens traded originated from the western province districts of Bungoma, Busia, Kakamega, and Malaba. half (51%) of the ducks traded originated from the western province districts of Bungoma, Busia, Kakamega, and Malaba. ducks, geese, and turkeys stayed on average 15 times longer than chickens in the market. over half of the ducks, geese, and turkeys had been in the markets for 30 days at the time of sampling. most (995%) specimens were collected from healthy birds. chicken OP 2138 2129 26 (12) 08, 18 35 (17) CL 2038 2037 9 (04) 02, 08 Turkey OP 187 186 3 (16) 03, 46 3 (16) CL 195 195 0 (00) 00, 19 Goose OP 165 162 4 (25) 07, 61 4 (24) CL 177 173 0 (00) 00, 21 Duck OP 158 156 0 (00) 00, 23 0 CL 163 161 0 influenza virus was detected in five live bird markets (LBMs) during influenza surveillance in LBMs in Kenya, March 2009\u2013February 2011 Market OP/CL specimens Environmental specimens Samples collected No. of influenza A viruses detected/tested (%) No. of influenza A viruses positive (95% CI) influenza virus prevalence was highest in geese 4/168 (24%) and lowest in turkeys 3/191 (16%) there was no significant difference in the observed prevalence of influenza among chickens, turkeys, geese, and ducks. half (55%) of the chickens traded in all the markets originated from the western province districts of Bungoma, Busia, Kakamega, and Malaba. half (51%) of the ducks traded originated from the Western province districts of Bungoma, Busia, Kakamega, and Malaba. ducks, geese, and turkeys stayed on average 15 times longer than chickens in the market. over half of the ducks, geese, and turkeys had been in the markets for 30 days at the time of sampling. most (995%) of the specimens were collected from healthy birds. influenza A virus was detected in 42 (08%) of the 5199 (996%) specimens tested that could be linked to individual bird data. no virus was detected in 317 duck OP/CL specimens [23% upper limit at 95% confidence level (CI)] influenza virus was detected in poultry in 14 (6364%) of these months. the median monthly detection rate was 04%. the highest detection rate was in January 2011. influenza A was detected in OP but not in CL specimens. influenza virus prevalence was highest in geese 4/168 (24%) and lowest in turkeys 3/191 (16%). 6% of chicken specimens were positive for AIVs, 14. 31% and 61% of duck and geese specimens were positive for AIVs. ducks are associated with maintenance of influenza virus in domestic birds. experimentally inoculated geese and chicken shed higher virus titers in oropharyngeal swabs. 20, 21 Naturally occurring inhibitors present in cloacal and environmental swabs have been shown to limit the sensitivity of rt RTPCR. we used rt RTPCR for screening of the specimens for influenza A virus. this method has high sensitivity and specificity for detection of type A influenza matrix gene. virological studies only establish the prevalence of active infections. authors thank the staff of the Virology laboratory, central Veterinary laboratory, Kabete for their tireless participation in sampling of the birds. authors thank Joshua Mott for his helpful advice during the surveillance period which made this work a success.
