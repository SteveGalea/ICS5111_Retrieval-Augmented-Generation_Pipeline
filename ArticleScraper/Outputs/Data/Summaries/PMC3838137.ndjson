{"summary": "the infectious clone is a form of viral genome cloned on a plasmid that can be propagated in Escherichia coli and manipulated for reverse-genetics analysis. the instability of certain viral genome sequences in E. coli has limited the scale of genetic analyses for these viruses. a large-scale genetic analysis relying on cloning methods still requires significant efforts to establish mutant or chimeric viruses. viral PCR products were assembled onto an expression plasmid with a cytomegalovirus promoter that precisely initiated transcription on the virus genome sequence. a terminator, such as hepatitis D virus (HDV) ribozyme, accurately generated 3\u2032 end of the transcribed viral RNA (13, 14) vero cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 and 80% humidity in MEM supplemented with 1 mM glutamine and 10% fetal-calf serum. DV4 strain v17 was generated by serial passaging of DENV4-H241 in vero cells for 17 passages. cDNA synthesis was carried out with superscript III first-strand synthesis kit (Invitrogen) the primers for cDNA synthesis were 10601-10621-rv-dv4 and 10639-10661-rv-dv2 for DENV4 and DENV2 respectively.

PCR amplifications of cDNAs of DENV4-H241 (and DENV2-16681) genomes were carried out by two pairs of primers: CMV-5\u2032 UTR-DV4 (DV2) and DV4-6671-6698-rv (or DV2-6685-6709-rv) for the first half of the genome; DV4-6671-6698-fw (or DV2-6685-6709-fw) and 3\u2032 UTR NS5-dv4-end-rv (NS5), NS5-dv4-end-fw and 3\u2032 UTR-DV4 (3\u2032 UTR) overlaps between fragments to be assembled were in the range of 20 to 40 bp. PCR products of the expression vector (0.02 to 0.04 pmol) were assembled in a Gibson enzyme mix. the clarified medium was stored at 70\u00b0C for subsequent infection, virus titration, and viral RNA extraction.

Crossing small-focus (strain 4.1) and large-focus (strain v17) viruses to map the mutations that confer large foci. the randomized position in E and heterogeneous nucleotides in M and NS4B are highlighted in yellow. the foci for each virus stock in duplicate wells are shown. well images were scanned and digitized with a KS ELISPOT reader. PCR amplification was performed with either Phusion polymerase (NEB) or Accuprime high-fidelity Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) to control for contamination of assembled DNA from transfection reaction, another cDNA synthesis reaction with RNase A (Fermentas) was also set up. infected cells were supplemented with 1 ml MEM supplemented with 2% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. the medium from infected cells was collected for virus titration at every 24 to 26 h. glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 20 mM HEPES and high glucose (4.5 g/liter) vero cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 and 80% humidity in MEM supplemented with 1 mM glutamine and 10% fetal-calf serum. DV4 strain v17 was generated by serial passaging of DENV4-H241 in vero cells for 17 passages. 40PA were assembled onto a pUC19 backbone first with In-fusion HD (Clontech) and later by conventional restriction ligation (NheI and BamHI sites) the plasmid construct was verified by sequencing. cDNA synthesis was carried out with Superscript III first-strand synthesis kit (Invitrogen) hCMV-rv CGGTTCACTAAACGAGCTCTGCTTATATAGACCTCCCACCG HDV-fw-dv2 CTGTTGAATCAACAGGTTCTGGGTCGGCATCATCTCTCC HDV-fw-dv2 CTGTTGAATCAACAGGTTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCT NS3-dv4-end-rv CTTTCTTCCACTGGCAAACTCCTTG NS3-dv4-end-fw GGCTGCTATGGAAGACCAATAATGGTG NS4A-2K-dv4-end-fw. all PCR products were cleaned up using a PCR cleanup kit from Invitrogen before use in DNA assembly and sequencing. PCR amplifications of cDNAs of DENV4-H241 (and DENV2-16681) genomes were carried out by two pairs of primers: CMV-5\u2032 UTR-DV4 (DV2) and DV4-6671-6698-rv (or DV2-6685-6709-rv) for the first half of the genome; DV4-6671-6698-fw (or DV2-6685-6709-fw) and 3\u2032 UTR PCR products of both expression vector and viral cDNA were assembled together in a Gibson enzyme mix. overlaps between fragments to be assembled were in the range of 20 to 40 bp. the formula of the enzyme mix for overlap between 20 to 150 bp was used for the assembly. ISF-1 (Biochrom) was used instead of DMEM. the clarified medium was stored at 70\u00b0C for infection, virus titration, and viral RNA extraction. arrows represent direction of repair by Phusion polymerase during assembly reaction. randomized position in E and heterogeneous nucleotides in M and NS4B are highlighted in yellow. the foci for each virus stock in duplicate wells are shown. PCR amplification was performed with either Phusion polymerase (NEB) or Accuprime high-fidelity Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) to control for contamination of assembled DNA from transfection reaction, another cDNA synthesis reaction with RNase A (Fermentas) was also set up. infection was carried out for 2 h at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. cells were washed three times with 1 ml plain MEM. medium from infected cells was collected for virus titration. transfection of 15 l of the assembly reaction into 293T cells. using 10 l of Lipofectamine 2000 and 500 l Opti-MEM-I (Invitrogen) produced virus (up to 105 focus-forming units [FFU]/ml) in culture media within a few days. the virus used in focus comparison correspond to the viruses with the same label in Fig. 3A (E and NS4B; left-hand panel), and 3D (E1690 and E1527+NS4B). a comparison between the foci of a set of mutant viruses generated from Gibson assembly and from a sequence-verified infectious clone also showed similar phenotypes. we characterized the foci of progeny viruses to determine which genetic differences conferred their phenotypes. focus size is an indicator of how well a virus replicates. a genetic variant that changes focus size can affect the replication of the virus. we constructed additional 18 chimeric 4.1 viruses with single or combined changes at these positions. the focus sizes of a subset of these viruses suggested that the v17 mutations at position prM550 and prM847) could replace the prM and v17 mutations in reconstituting v17 foci. the focus assay of the DENV library indicated the presence of small-focus viruses that were not present when the amino acid at E1690 was not randomized in the same genetic background. this technique could directly diversify an existing pool of virus mutants by assembling the scrambled PCR products with those derived from heterogeneous viral cDNAs. growth comparison of DENV2-16681, v17, and H241 DENVs derived from Gibson assembly, conventional virus culture, and the infectious clone (17). all the experiments were performed with Vero cells. the shuffling requires sequencing of only two sets of viral DNA templates. chimeric viruses produced directly from transfected 293T cells were directly used for phenotype characterization to minimize the effects from random PCR errors. a panel of v17 gene combinations inserted into 4.1 could reconstitute the large v17 foci. we found that the combination of prM, E, NS4B, and NS5 of v17 could reconstitute the large v17 foci. we constructed additional 18 chimeric 4.1 viruses with single or combined changes at these positions. a DENV library was created by combining PCR products of prM, E (randomized at E1690) and NS4B from strain v17 and the rest from strain 4.1. the sequence chromatograms of prM847 and NS4B7016 showed heterogeneity. this technique could directly diversify an existing pool of viruses. CPEC was applied to construct west Nile viruses in a similar bacterium-free approach for virus construction (24) the virus construction by CPEC could achieve similar recovery of the heterogeneity of a west Nile virus stock (24) the virus construction approach described here addresses the throughput limitations of infectious clones. it is based on direct exploitation of PCR products amplified from viral cDNA. throughput capability gained will support functional characterization of virus variants. technique should accelerate vaccine and antiviral-drug development."}
