{"summary": "porcine circovirus type 1 (PCV1), porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) and porcine circovirus 3 (PCV3) are characterized as clinical or subclinical PCV2 infections among pigs. the most representative symptoms of the diseases include porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS), which occurs during the growing or finishing stage of pigs. co-infections of different pigs with PCV2 and other swine viruses are also reviewed. a retrospective study of PCV2 infection between 1996 and 1999 in china revealed a novel genotype PCV2f which shared lower sequence identity with other known genotypes. co-infections with different PCV2 genotypes may cause more serious disease. pigs with dually heterologous inoculation or naturally infected with multiple PCV2 genotypes displayed more severe lesions. pigs with dually heterologous inoculation displayed more severe lesions. PCV3 was divided into three major clades (PCV3a, PCV3b and PCV3c) based on complete coding sequences. other groups have found that PCV3 has a close relationship with bat circovirus [32,38,43], which might pose a potential risk to public health due to its close relationship with bat circovirus. PCV2 infection causes immunosuppression in pigs, which provides vital conditions for other pathogens to infect. two amino acid mutations (A24V and R27K) on the PCV3 Cap protein were supposed to be related to immune escape under immune pressure from the host. PCV2 and PRRSV co-inoculated pigs had severe dyspnea, lethargy, and occasional icterus by 10 days post-inoculation (dpi) and were dead by 20 dpi, while PCV2-infected pigs developed lethargy, sporadic icterus and exudative epidermitis. co-infection of pigs with PRRSV and PCV2a results in increased expression profile of IL-1 and TLR2, 4 and 8, and negatively synergistic effect on mRNA expression of TLRs 3, 7 and 9, A20, Bcl-3, IRAK-M, MKP-1, SARM1 and SIGIRR. co-infection induces significantly lower levels of anti-PCV2 and anti-PRRSV IgG antibodies. PPV is a virus that normally replicates in the intestines of pigs without causing clinical symptoms. however, when PPV and PCV2 co-infect pigs, obvious clinical symptoms appear. co-infection with PPV results in litters with mummified and stillborn newborns. pigs infected with PCV2 and PPV exhibit increased TNF- compared to pigs inoculated with PCV2 or PPV alone. PPV and PCV2 play important roles in reproductive failure. classical swine fever virus (CSFV) is a small, enveloped, plus-strand RNA virus that causes a serious and contagious viral disease in pigs and wild boar worldwide. increasing clinical evidence has shown co-infection of PCV2 and CSFV in pigs. CD8CD25+, CD4+CD8+CD25+, and CD4CD8+CD25+ lymphocytes were significantly lower in the pigs co-inoculated with PCV2 and the attenuated CSFV compared with that of pigs vaccinated with the attenuated CSFV alone. PCV2 may enhance wild-type CSFV infection by inhibiting host immune response, while PCV2 could decrease efficacy of the CSFV vaccine antibodies to the SwIV subtype H1N1 were detected in 49% of the pigs in government farms and in 8% of the village backyard pigs. the predominant endemic strain was H1N1 (60.5%), whereas subtypes H1N2 (14.0%), H3N2 (14.0%) and human pandemic H1N1 virus or reassortants (11.5%) were detected less frequently. PRV is a member of the genus Varicellovirus, and the family Herpesviridae. it targets the mucosal epithelium of the pig respiratory and nervous system tissue. it was suggested that PCV2 and PRV co-infection is another factor of PRDC. PCV2 is easily detectable in pigs naturally infected with PEDV. in neonatal piglets, severe anorexia, vomiting and diarrhea were seen in PEDV/PCV2 co-infected piglets within 12 h post inoculation (hpi) levels of PEDV genomic RNA in PEDV and PCV2 co-infected sows were significantly higher than those in PEDV positive and PCV2 negative sows at 24 hpi co-infection with PCV2 and PEDV resulted in more severe clinical symptoms compared to animals infected with PEDV alone. TTSuV1 is subgrouped into the species TTSuV1a and TTSuV1b in the genus Iotatorquevirus, while TTSuV2 belongs to the genus Kappatorquevirus. Tissues from PCV2-affected pigs showed higher TTSuV2 loads than the tissues of the healthy group. the rate of co-infection of PCV2 and TTSuV1 was 54.5% in pigs suffering from PMWS [116]. PCV2 co-infected with PRRSV enforced clinical signs of PMWS. vaccination against PCV2 significantly protected pigs against multiple viral infections. this suggests that vaccination against PCV2 decreases the risk of PMWS and reduces susceptibility of pigs to the other viral pathogens. the infection rate of PCV3 in wild boars was similar or higher than that of domestic pigs, with the infection rates of 33% to 42.66%. PCV3 has been associated with cardiac and multisystemic inflammation, PRDC, PDNS and reproductive failure. the co-infection rates were 27.6\u201339.39% and 19.14% in pig farms and slaughter houses. the co-infection of swine with PRRSV and PCV2 is common in clinical conditions. the co-infection rate of PRRSV and PCV2 has been reported as 42% and up to 85.4% in lungs with proliferative and necrotizing pneumonia lesions in postweaned pigs. ated pigs only showed dyspnea and mild lethargy. PRRSV-inoculated pigs also had severe proliferative interstitial pneumonia. piglets infected with HP-PRRSV followed by PCV2 infection. co-infection induces significantly lower levels of anti-PCV2 and anti-PRRSV IgG antibodies. also, PCV2/PRRSV co-infection plays an immunomodulatory role in the pathogenesis of PCVAD. levels of the inhibitory markers PD-L1 and IL-10 are significantly increased. co-infection with PCV2 and PPV in gilts and sows results in litters with mummified and stillborn newborns, as well as seropositive, viable newborns. pigs co-infected with PPV and PPV appear dull and experience jaundice at approximately 10\u201312 dpi. pigs infected with PCV2 and PPV exhibit significantly increased TNF- compared to pigs inoculated with PCV2 or PPV alone. levels of TNF- in the sera are inversely correlated with the body weight of pigs that have been experimentally dually infected with PCV2 and PPV. pigs co-inoculated with attenuated CSFV showed transient fever, viremia, and viral shedding in the saliva and feces after being challenged with wild-type CSFV. pigs co-inoculated with PCV2 showed transient fever, viremia, and viral shedding in the saliva and feces after being challenged with wild-type CSFV. PCV2 may enhance wild-type CSFV infection by inhibiting host immune response. PCV2 could decrease efficacy of the CSFV vaccine, especially during PCVD. PRDC is an economically significant problem characterized by slow growth. 3-week-old PCV2-positive pigs were more likely to have SwIV infections. systemic disease was greater in 16-week-old PCV2-positive pigs than in their PCV2-negative counterparts. co-infection with SwIV did not increase the number of PCV2 genomic copies in the serum or the target tissues. PCV2 infection can downregulate immune cell function during recall antigen responses, and induce IL-10 secretion by monocytic cells. PRV-induced IFN- secretion, IL-4 and IL-12p40 upregulation are also inhibited by PCV2 infection. the ability of PCV2 to hamper the development of immune responses may contribute to the Th1 suppressed responses, immune suppression and co-infection. in neonatal piglets, severe anorexia, vomiting and diarrhea were seen in PEDV/PCV2 co-infected piglets within 12 h post inoculation (hpi) the mean villous height and crypt depth (VH:CD) ratio in sows co-infected with PEDV and PCV2 was significantly decreased compared to those infected with PEDV alone at 36, 48, 60 and 72 hpi. TTSuV1 is subgrouped into the species TTSuV1a and TTSuV1b in the genus Iotatorquevirus, while TTSuV2 belongs to the genus Kappatorquevirus. the association between TTSuV and PMWS has been controversial among the different studies. Vlasakova and colleagues evaluated the prevalence of co-infections in five pig groups, including sick suckling pigs, sick post-weaning pigs, sick fattening pigs, and healthy fattening pigs vaccinated with or without PCV2-vaccine. the positive rate was 4.8% (5/103). co-infections of PCV2 with other viruses may increase pathogenicity in pigs, resulting in more severe clinical symptoms. many lines of evidence have shown that bacterial infection, vaccination failure, stress or crowding together with PCV2 can also lead to PCVD/PCVAD."}
