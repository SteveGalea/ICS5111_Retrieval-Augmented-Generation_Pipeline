{"summary": "arenaviruses belong to the family Arenaviridae and are classified into two complexes. Clade B contains 5 hemorrhagic fever-causing arenaviruses. Lassa virus (LASV) is endemic in western africa. the first cellular receptor for arenavirus to be identified was -dystroglycan (DG), a ubiquitous receptor for extracellular matrix proteins (6). DG is a binding receptor for Old World arenaviruses, such as LASV and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), and some of the clade C new world arenaviruses (7). a number of additional receptor candidates have recently been reported. type virus systems based on vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) or lentivirus and retrovirus have also been established to examine viral entry mechanisms and to identify putative entry receptors. these systems are beneficial in the study of highly pathogenic arenavirus infections. plasmid pKS-EBOV-GP, pKS-LASV-GP, and pKS-LASV-GP were cloned into pCAG-MCS2-FOS to express carboxyl-terminally FOS-tagged fusion protein. cDNA encoding G protein (G) of VSV was amplified from pCAG-VSV-G by PCR and cloned into pCAG-MCS2-FOS cDNA encoding hTfR1 was amplified by PCR using an Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) the amplified cDNA was cloned into pKS-hTfR1. the cloned sequence was confirmed to be identical to the hTfR1 cDNA sequence using an ABI Prism 3100-Avant genetic analysis. transfected CHO cells were selected with DMEM containing 10% FBS and 2 g/ml of Blasticidin S-HCl (Invitrogen) when clusters of the cells appeared, some clusters of the cells were cloned and subcultured to establish CHO/hTfR1. after 24 h of incubation, the transfected cells were infected with pCAG-VSV-G. the virus was adsorbed and then extensively washed four times with serum-free DMEM. the infectious titers of the pseudotype VSVs were also determined by a focus-forming assay. pCAG-CHPV-GP-FOS, pCAG-CHPV-GP-FOS, or pCAG-VSV-G-FOS or CHO/hTfR1 cells were fixed with acetone at room temperature for 5 min. the cells were incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG primary antibody (Sigma) and mouse monoclonal anti-hTfR1 antibody (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), respectively each sample, boiled in loading buffer, was subjected to 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) the proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a methanol-activated polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and reacted with mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) Huh7 or U937 cells were pretreated with various concentrations of anti-hTfR1 for 1 h at 37\u00b0C and inoculated with a series of AREpv, VSVpv, or MLVpv. after 1 h of adsorption at 37\u00b0C, the cells were washed and cultured for 24 h at 37\u00b0C. AREpv infectivity for CHO and CHO/hTfR1 cells was normal the cells were prepared by infection with lentiviral vectors encoding LARGE, DG, or control (fCD2) genes. the cells were infected with a series of AREpv, VSVpv, or MLVpv at an MOI of 1. Pseudotype infectivity was determined by measuring luciferase activities after 24 h of incubation at 37\u00b0C. the viruses were inoculated into Huh7 cells after 24 h of incubation at 37\u00b0C. the cells were treated with various concentrations of chlorpromazine, imipramine, desipramine, amitriptyline, or U18666A. the cells were then infected with the series of AREpv, EBOpv, VSVpv, or MLVpv at an MOI of 1. 293T cells were grown on 35-mm tissue culture plates and transfected with pCAG-CHPV-GP-FOS, pCAG-LUJV-GP-FOS, pCAG-LASV-GP-FOS, or pCAG-VSV-G-FOS. at 24 h posttransfection, the cells were rinsed once with PBS and then incubated with citrate-phosphate buffers adjusted to the indicated pH value (pH the 293T cells were treated with 0.05% EDTA in PBS and suspended in DMEM containing 10% FBS. the cocultured cells were bathed in citrate-phosphate buffers adjusted to the indicated pH values for 2 min and then incubated with DMEM containing 10% FBS for 12 h. plasmid pKS-EBOV-GP, LUJV-GP, pKS-LUJV-GP, and pKS-LASV-GP were cloned into pCAG-MCS2-FOS. the resulting plasmids were designated pCAG-CHPV-GP-FOS, pCAG-LUJV-GP-FOS, and pCAG-LASV-GP-FOS. cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription with Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) using random hexamer primers (Invitrogen) the amplified cDNA was cloned into pKS336. the resulting plasmid was designated pKS-hTfR1. the cloned sequence was confirmed to be identical to the hTfR1 cDNA sequence. the transfected CHO cells were selected with DMEM containing 10% FBS and 2 g/ml of Blasticidin S-HCl (Invitrogen) when clusters of the cells appeared, some clusters of the cells were cloned and subcultured to establish CHO/hTfR1. pFBASALF expresses murine leukemia virus envelope proteins. after 24 h of incubation, the transfected cells were infected with pCAG-VSV-G. the virus was adsorbed and then extensively washed four times with serum-free DMEM. pCAG-LASV-GP-FOS, pCAG-JUNV-GP-FOS, pCAG-LUJV-GP-FOS, or pCAG-VSV-G-FOS or pCAG-VSV-G-FOS were incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG primary antibody (Sigma) and mouse monoclonal anti-hTfR1 antibody were prepared and stained as hTfR1 negative each sample, boiled in loading buffer, was subjected to 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) the proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a methanol-activated polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and reacted with mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) Huh7 or U937 cells were pretreated with various concentrations of anti-hTfR1 for 1 h at 37\u00b0C and inoculated with a series of AREpv, VSVpv, or MLVpv at an MOI of 1. after 1 h of adsorption at 37\u00b0C, the cells were washed and cultured for 24 h at 37\u00b0C. i, Jurkat, or DG knockout ES cells expressing like-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (LARGE) or DG were prepared by infection with lentiviral vectors encoding LARGE, DG, or control (fCD2) genes. luciferase activities were determined by measuring luciferase activities after 24 h of incubation at 37\u00b0C. after 24 h of incubation at 37\u00b0C, residual infectivity was determined by measuring luciferase activities. the cells were then infected with the series of AREpv, EBOpv, VSVpv, or MLVpv at an MOI of 1. Huh7 cells were transfected with pCAG-CHPV-GP-FOS, pCAG-LUJV-GP-FOS, pCAG-JUNV-GP-FOS, or pCAG-VSV-G-FOS. at 24 h posttransfection, the cells were rinsed once with PBS and then incubated with citrate-phosphate buffers adjusted to the indicated pH value. the citrate-phosphate buffers were the 293T cells were treated with 0.05% EDTA in PBS and suspended in DMEM containing 10% FBS. the cocultured cells were bathed in citrate-phosphate buffers adjusted to the indicated pH values for 2 min and then incubated with DMEM containing 10% FBS. all of the GPCs in the lysates of the cells transfected with GPC-expressing plasmids and G2 incorporated into the viral particles that were examined in the present study were sensitive to both Endo H and PNGase F treatments. in contrast, the sugar chains of VSV-G protein in the cells and on the virions were sensitive to PNGase F but resistant to Endo H. the MOI of each virus was determined on the basis of the titer in a focus-forming assay in Huh7 cells. a focus-forming assay was performed to evaluate the correlation of infectious titers and luciferase activities in AREpv infection. 3T3, NMuLi, and Jurkat cells were not susceptible to infection with LUJpv or LASpv. the infectivity of LUJpv, but not that of LASpv and VSVpv, for Huh7 cells was clearly inhibited by anti-LUJV-GP rabbit serum in a dose-dependent manner. the infectivities of the viruses were determined as RLU. infections by LASV, JUNV, and some other arenaviruses were inhibited by treatment with lysosomotropic agents. this suggests that arenaviruses enter target cells via pH-dependent endocytosis. the treatment of the cells with these reagents did not affect the infectivity of MLVpv. hTfR1 was shown to be the principal receptor for the infection of new world clade B arenaviruses. it is not known whether LUJV exhibits hTfR1-dependent infection. infectivities of AREpv for CHO cells stably expressing hTfR1 were examined. infections by LASpv and VSVpv, which do not utilize hTfR1 as a receptor, were not affected by FAC treatment. LUJpv and LASpv infections exhibited TfR1-independent entry in AREpv infection. the infectivities of AREpv for CHO/hTfR1 cells were normalized to the infection of parental CHO cells. the cells were inoculated with LASpv, JUNpv, LUJpv, CHPpv, SABpv, MACpv, or VSVpv. after 1 h of incubation, the cells were inoculated with LASpv, JUNpv, LUJpv, C expression of DG in DG knockout ES cells resulted in an increase in LASpv infection. LUJpv and New World AREpv infections exhibited DG-independent cell entry. infectivities of AREpv in Jurkat or Raji cells expressing LARGE. Syncytium formation of Huh7 cells transiently expressing arenaviral GPs or VSV-G after treatment with low-pH buffer. at 24 h posttransfection, the cells were treated with citrate-phosphate buffer adjusted to the indicated pH value. LASpv, JUNpv, LUJpv, CHPpv, or VSVpv were exposed at the indicated pHs for 2 min. after neutralization with DMEM containing 10% FCS, the remaining infectivities of the pseudotypes for Huh7 cells were measured. syncytium formation was clearly observed. this may be due to cytotoxicity of the VSV-G in the expressing cells. pH 3 treatment of the cells induced cytotoxicity. LUJpv and LASpv infections were drastically reduced in comparison with the other AREpv. a cholesterol transport inhibitor, U18666A, was used to inhibit the function of NPC1 (36, 37) LASpv, JUNpv, LUJpv, CHPpv, and VSVpv were generated in 293T cells transiently expressing the carboxyl-terminally FOS-tagged envelope glycoproteins of LASV, JUNV, LUJV, CHAPV, and VSVpv. their relative infectivities were determined at 24 h postinfection by measuring the luciferase activities. the sugar chains of VSV-G protein in the cells and on the virions were sensitive to PNGase F but resistant to Endo H. in contrast, the sugar chains of VSV-G protein were modified to the complex- or hybrid-type glycans. the results are from three independent assays, with error bars representing standard deviation. luciferase activities of all AREpv-infected cells were correlated with the MOI. LASpv, JUNpv, LUJpv, LUJpv, CHPpv, SABpv, and MACpv were inoculated into the indicated cell lines. the infectivity of LUJpv, but not that of LASpv and VSVpv, for Huh7 cells was clearly inhibited by anti-LUJV-GP rabbit serum in a dose-dependent manner. these data indicated that LUJpv infection exhibited GP-mediated entry. lysosomotropic agents, such as ammonium chloride, or bafilomycin A1, suggest that arenaviruses enter target cells via pH-dependent endocytosis. the treatment of the cells with these reagents did not affect the infectivity of MLVpv, which enters cells through a pH-independent direct fusion of the viral membrane and plasma membrane. this result suggests that AREpv enter cells through pH-dependent endocytosis. hTfR1 was shown to be the principal receptor for the infection of new world clade B arenaviruses. it is not known whether LUJV exhibits hTfR1-dependent infection. infectivities of AREpv for CHO cells were examined. infections by LASpv and VSVpv, which do not utilize hTfR1 as a receptor, were not affected by FAC treatment. the results suggest that LUJV does not utilize hTfR1 as a receptor but utilizes an unknown receptor, which is affected by FAC treatment. the infectivities of AREpv for CHO/hTfR1 cells were normalized to the infection of parental CHO cells. after 1 h of incubation, the cells were inoculated with LASpv, JUNpv, LUJpv, CHPpv, SABpv, MACpv, or VSVpv. a series of AREpv were inoculated into LARGE-expressing Raji and Jurkat cells LASpv exhibited DG-dependent cell entry, while LUJpv and New World AREpv infections exhibited DG-independent cell entry. infectivities of AREpv in DG knockout ES cells expressing LARGE. at 24 h posttransfection, cells were infected with LASpv, JUNpv, LUJpv, CHPpv, or VSVpv. no syncytium formation was observed in LUJV-GP-expressing cells. cells were transfected with pCAG-LASV-GP-FOS, pCAG-JUNV-GP-FOS, pCAG-LUJV-GP-FOS, or pCAG-VSVG-FOS. at 24 h posttransfection, the cells were treated with citrate-phosphate buffer. exposure at the indicated pH for 2 min was determined by measuring RLU. LASpv, JUNpv, LUJpv, CHPpv, or VSVpv was exposed at the indicated pHs for 2 min. luciferase activities were determined at 24 h postinfection. infectivities of all AREpv, including LUJpv, were abolished after low-pH treatment and within 2 min of exposure. LASpv was relatively resistant to low-pH exposure in comparison to other AREpv infections. effects of other lipidosis-inducing drugs, imipramine, desipramine, and amitriptyline, were also examined. treatment with the chemical resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in LUJpv and EBOpv infectivities. these inhibitors also partially decreased LASpv infectivity. infectivities of pseudotype arenaviruses in wild-type CHO cells (CHO/wt), NPC1-deficient CHO cell mutants (CHO/A101) and CHO/A101 cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged NPC1 (CHO/A101/NPC1-KI) were obtained. the results are from three independent assays, with error bars representing standard deviations. the fact that mature G2 was detected in the AREpv is consistent with a previous report that showed that only cleaved G1 and G2 were incorporated into the virions. previous studies have demonstrated the glycosylation of both LASV-GP and JUNV-GP by N-linked high-mannose-type oligosaccharide (39, 40) LUJpv is known to be able to propagate in veroE6 cells (43) the present study showed that both COS7 and Huh7 cells were highly susceptible to LUJpv infection. however, no susceptibility was observed in mouse-derived cell lines. observation of syncytium formation and the cell-cell fusion assay provide simple, quantitative, and versatile tools to study viral-glycoprotein-mediated cell fusion. in the present study, with exception of LUJV-GP, cell fusion induced by arenaviral GPs initiated by treatment with low-pH buffer was clearly observed. however, immunofluorescence assays with and without permeabilized conditions revealed no difference between the localization of GP in LU LUJpv-GP shows unique characteristics among arenaviral GPs. no visible syncytium formation was observed in the cells expressing Ebola virus GP under similar experimental conditions. it was recently reported that in Ebola virus infection, the interaction of NPC1 with Ebola virus GP activated by the cathepsins is required for endosomal membrane fusion (31, 32) pseudotype arenaviruses are useful for further detailed examination of arenaviral entry mechanisms."}
