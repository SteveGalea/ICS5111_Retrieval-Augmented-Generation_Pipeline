{"summary": "monoclonal antibody (mAb) against recombinant human RANK receptor was generated using hybridoma technology. we then synthesized osteoclast-targeting bioconjugates of salmon calcitonin (sCT) using this antibody by generating thiol groups on mAb using 2-Iminothiolane and reacting them with sCT-PEG-MAL synthesised from sCT. cAMP assay confirms the retention of calcitonin bioactivity after conjugation. cAMP assay confirms the retention of calcitonin bioactivity."}
