{"summary": "influenza virus (IAV) is a common respiratory pathogen that undergoes seasonal antigenic drift continually giving rise to variant strains that can escape existing immune protection. this viral drift detrimentally impacts public health as well as the economy within the united states. phenotype is thought to depend on antigen longevity, antigen presenting cells (APC) and tertiary structures within the tissues (18\u201323). vaccines that utilize tissue-specific factors and pathways critical for the induction of pulmonary T and B cell responses to generate local as well as systemic immunity by mimicking IAV infection. i.n. vaccination with IAV-nanovax induced robust lung-resident GC cells along with systemic and lung localized IAV-specific antibody responses. similar to IAV infections, i.n. administered IAV-nanovax induced lung-resident memory CD4 and CD8 T cell responses. these IAV-specific humoral and cellular immune responses were associated with protection against homologous and heterologous infection. the 20:80 CPTEG:CPH copolymer, along with HA, NP, and CpG (ODN 1668, Invivogen, San Diego, CA), was dissolved at a polymer concentration of 20 mg/mL in methylene chloride. the solution was sonicated for 30 s and precipitated into chilled pentane (at a methylene chloride:pentane ration of 1:250) mice received i.n. 500 g of IAV-nanovax in 50 L of PBS. mice were infected with a 110 TCIU or 1108 TCIU dose of mouse adapted A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) or 390 TCIU dose of A/Hong Kong/1/68 (H3N2) strains. penh values were recorded daily based on volume and pressure changes over 5 min. dilutions of homogenized lung samples were applied to confluent canine kidney epithelial cells and incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. cell layers were fixed in 4% formaldehyde, blocked with 5% milk. blood samples were left at room temperature for 30 min, centrifuged at 16,000 g for 20 min, and then collected and stored at 20\u00b0C until analysis. tracheae were cannulated with a 22-gage catheter tube (attached to a 5cc syringe) and then washed once with 1 mL of sterile PBS. Optical densities were measured at 405 nm using SpectraMax M5 Multi-mode microplate reader from Molecular Devices (Sunnyvale, CA) sera and BAL were inactivated by heating at 56\u00b0C for 30 min and then absorbed in a chicken red blood cell suspension for 30 min. each well then received 1% CBRC suspension and HAI titer was measured after a 30 min incubation. rat anti-mouse CD11a (M17/4; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), rat anti-mouse CD103 (M290; BD Biosciences), and rat anti-mouse CD69 (H1.2F3; eBioscience), to identify CD4 and CD8 T cells. cells were stained with rat anti-mouse CD19 (1D3; BD Biosciences), rat anti-mouse B220 (RA3-6 polymers based on 1,8-bis(p-carboxyphenoxy)-3,6-dioxoctane (CPTEG) and 1,6-bis(p-carboxyphenoxy)hexane (CPH) were synthesized. the final copolymer composition, purity, and molecular weight of the copolymer were characterized using 1H HNMR. mice were bred, housed, and maintained in the university of Iowa animal care facilities. mice received 500 g of IAV-nanovax in 50 L of PBS containing 2.5 g of free HA and NP proteins. mice were infected i.n. with a 110 TCIU or 1108 TCIU dose of mouse adapted A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) or a 390 TCIU dose of A/Hong Kong/1/68 (H3N2) strains. mice were euthanized upon reaching 70% of their starting weight. mice were administered 1 g of fluorophore-conjugated rat anti-mouse CD45.2 (clone 104; BioLegend, San Diego, CA) in 200 L of PBS by retroorbital intravenous injection. blood samples were left at room temperature for 30 min, centrifuged at 16,000 g for 20 min, and then collected and stored at 20\u00b0C until analysis. samples were stored at 20\u00b0C until analysis. they were digested for 30 min at 37\u00b0C in media containing 1 mg/mL Collagenase (Type 3; MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH) and 0.02 mg/mL DNase-I (MP Biomedicals), then pressed through wire mesh. serum and BAL were inactivated by heating at 56\u00b0C for 30 min. serum was absorbed in 1% CBRC at 1:5 and BAL was absorbed in 10% CBRC at 1:2. each well then received 1% CBRC suspension and HAI titer was measured after a 30 min incubation. CD8lo expression was used to quantify antigen-experienced CD8 T cells. cells were stained with rat anti-mouse CD19 (1D3; BD Biosciences), rat anti-mouse B220 (RA3-6B2; BioLegend), rat anti-mouse IgM (B7-6), and FITC-conjugated peanut agglutinin. i.n. vaccine (iAV-nanovax) contains 20:80 CPTEG:CPH nanoparticles encapsulating 5 g of both IAV HA and NP proteins. a 10 g CpG oligo (ODN 1668) is known to induce cross-presentation by dendritic cells. the i.n. vaccine (iAV-nanovax) was designed to generate both lung-focused as well as systemic immunity. mice were intravascularly (i.v.) infused prior to lung harvest with a fluorescent antibody to label B cells within the circulation (CD45i.v.Abpos) vs. those in the lung parenchyma (CD45i.v.Abneg) compared to nave and IIV controls at 32 and 45 days following infection/vaccination. i.n. administration of IAV-nanovax induces lung-resident GC B cell responses. mice were challenged i.n. with a 110 TCIU of A/Puerto Rico/8/1934. vaccinated i.m. with IIV, prime+boost vaccinated i.n. with IAV-nanovax. serum levels of IAV-specific IgG antibodies were 2\u20133x higher in animals after IAV-nanovax and IAV infection than in mice receiving IIV. this difference in measurable IAV-specific IgG within the BAL is likely related to the lack of a local lung GC response in the IIV vaccinated mice. IAV-nanovax vaccination induces both local and systemic IAV-specific antibody responses. at 32 and 45 days post challenge/vaccination, serum and BAL were collected. serum and BAL levels were quantified by ELISA. the CD4 and CD8 T cell response to IAV has been shown to encompass a large number of epitopes, each only being expressed at low frequency (44). compared to nave mice, IAV infection and IAV-nanovax vaccination generated an increased frequency of antigen-experienced CD4 and CD8 T cells within the lungs at days 7, 32, and 45. C57BL/6 mice were vaccinated/infected as described in Figure 1. at day 7, 32, and 45 post challenge/vaccination lungs were harvested. number of (C\u2013E) lung-resident AgExp CD4 and (F\u2013H) lung-resident AgExp CD8 T cells were determined. CD69posCD103pos and CD69pos CD103neg lung-resident AgExp CD4 T cell subsets were elevated in IAV-nanovax, but not IIV vaccinated mice. by day 32 following IAV-infection or IAV-nanovax vaccination, the fraction and number of CD8 Trm cells resident within the lungs were significantly increased relative to nave and IIV vaccinated mice. total numbers of (C) lung-resident memory CD4 T cells and (D) lung-resident memory CD8 T cells were determined. data are two pooled experiments with n = 8 mice/group. compared protection after a prime only vs. prime+boost vaccination schedule. IAV-nanovax prime+boost mice exhibited little to no weight loss or increases in Penh. mice received one-dose i.n. of IAV-nanovax (prime only), two-doses i.n. of IAV-nanovax (prime+boost), or were left unvaccinated. prime only and prime+boost IAV-nanovax vaccinated mice were challenged with a lethal dose of a mouse-adapted strain of IAV. the ability to IAV-nanovax to confer protection against a heterologous virus challenge is likely due to the local lung adaptive immune. response induced by IAV-nanovax as IIV vaccinated mice had limited to no protection from a heterologous challenge (Supplemental Data Sheet 2D\u2013F) this protection appears to require adaptive immunity specific to influenza. mice vaccinated with polyanhydride particles that only contained CpG and no IAV protein (CpG Particles) showed no pulmonary B or T cell responses (Supplemental Data Sheet 4A\u2013D) and were not protected upon subsequent viral we included a free antigen component in our vaccine as our prior results with s.c. vaccination had demonstrated that inclusion of this free antigen component enhanced immune responses and protection. in order to determine if the free antigen component was likewise required during i. n. vaccination we next compared immune responses and protection in mice vaccinated with IAV-nanovax the free IAV antigens. groups of non-vaccinated mice were included as controls. they were then challenged with either lethal dose homologous (Figures 7A\u2013C) or heterologous (Figures 7D\u2013F) IAV. IAV-nanovax induces lung-resident GC B cells and IAV-specific antibody responses. a 20:80 CPTEG:CPH nanoparticle formulation is an effective delivery vehicle for IAV antigens and generation of systemic immune responses when given s.c. (26) we used an in vivo fluorophore-conjugated antibody labeling technique (34) to distinguish between lymphocytes embedded in the lung interstitium from those in the vasculature. we compared the response to mice i.n. infected with IAV (PR8; H1N1), mice i.m. vaccinated with IIV, or mice left untreated (nave) IAV infection induces a substantial proportion of the GC response in the lungs to switch to IgG (IgMnegIgGpos) similar to IAV-infected mice, approximately 70% of lung resident GC B cells were IgMneg in IAV-nanovax mice. we quantified total IAV-specific IgG and IgA antibody following infection/vaccination. serum levels of IAV-specific IgG antibodies were 2\u20133x higher in animals after IAV-nanovax and IAV infection than in mice receiving IIV. serum hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titers were similar to IAV infected mice. but only IAV-nanovax vaccinated mice possessed protective levels of HAI antibodies within the BAL. IAV-nanovax generates antigen experienced CD4 and CD8 T cell responses within the lungs. compared to nave mice, IAV infection and IAV-nanovax vaccination generated an increased frequency of antigen-experienced CD4 and CD8 T cells within the lungs. cinated mice were found in higher numbers compared to nave and IIV vaccinated mice. numbers of lung-resident AgExp CD4 and CD8 T cells were higher early (day 7) in IAV-infected mice compared to IAV-nanovax mice. phenotype Recent studies have demonstrated that the presence of lung-resident memory T cells after IAV infection increases protection. in the IAV-infected lung, the expression of CD69 was prominent in lung-resident (i.e., CD45i.v.Abneg) AgExp CD4 T cells at 32 and 45 days following IAV infection, a change that is associated with establishment of lung-resident memory cells (45) IAV-nanovax vaccination induces IAV-specific tissue-resident memory CD4 and CD8 T cells within the lungs. at 32 and 45 days post vaccination, mice were challenged with a lethal dose of homologous IAV. mice that received either prime only or prime+boost IAV-nanovax administration exhibited reduced signs of morbidity. this alleviation of disease is commensurate to IIV prime+boost vaccinated mice compared to nave. prime only and prime+boost IAV-nanovax vaccinated mice were challenged with a lethal dose of a mouse-adapted heterologous strain of IAV (A/Hong Kong/68, H3N2). both prime only (40%) and prime+boost (80%) IAV-nanovax mice were protected from mortality. the ability to IAV-nanovax to confer protection against heterologous virus challenge is likely due to the local lung adaptive immune response induced by IAV-nanovax. however, this protection appears to require adaptive immunity specific to influenza. data are of two pooled experiments (A,B,D,E) with n = 10 mice/group or representative of one independent experiment (C,F) with n = 5 mice/group. we included a free antigen component in our vaccine. the use of inbred models offers many advantages during the testing and design of vaccines. but these models do not represent the genetic diversity found in humans. we next i.n. vaccinated groups of outbred Swiss-Webster mice with IAV-nanovax. penh was recorded daily as a measurement of lung function (airway resistance) data are representative of one independent with n = 10 mice/group. i.n. administered CPTEG:CPH IAV-nanovax. intranasal vaccination with IAV-nanovax induced IAV-specific class-switched GC B cell responses that were resident in the lung. however, at some time points we did observe reduced IAV-specific IgG in IAV-nanovax vaccinated mice compared to IAV infection (day 45 serum, day 32 BAL, Figures 2B,D) we observed CD69posCD103pos CD4 Trm subset within the lungs of IAV-nanovax vaccinated mice. this subset has not been well characterized, but a study has reported this subset within the skin (49) previous studies have shown that the maintenance of Trm T cells within lung niches is influenced by the presence and longevity of antigen depots (18, 21, 23) i.n. vaccination with polyanhydride nanoparticles can induce tissue-resident memory CD4 and CD8 T cells, confer protection against a heterologous virus challenge, and protect against infection in outbred populations. authors say the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
