{"summary": "URTIs are common cold, sinusitis, laryngitis and pharyngitis. URTIs are usually caused by viruses, including rhinovirus, corona-virus, para influenza virus and adenovirus. essential oils were among the first topical and gastrointestinal antimicrobial agents used by humans. due to the extensive use of conventional antibiotics and synthetic antimicrobial drugs, there has been an increase in the widespread development of drug resistant microorganisms. essential oils have wide applications in medicine and aromatherapy. monoterpenes and sesquiterpenoids have been isolated. the chemical composition of the essential oil of A. vestita has also been investigated. at present, the in vivo and in vitro antibacterial activity of A. vestita against bacteria has not been reported previously. three samples of the dried aerial components (200 mg) were subjected to hydro-distillation at separate times. essential oil was collected and dehydrated using anhydrous Na2SO4 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and stored at 4\u00b0C prior to use. bacterial strains and culture media S. pyogenes (cat. no. ATCC-12344), MRSA, S. pneumoniae (cat. no. ATCC-2730), Klebsiella pneumoniae (cat. no. ATCC-27853) and Haemophilus influenzae (cat. no. ATCC-33391) were used in the present study. essential oil and its chemical constituents were serially diluted in 2 mg/ml dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Sigma-Aldrich) and added to MH agar (Sigma-Aldrich) the final column wells contained 150 l MH broth and 5 l inoculum as a negative control. the final concentration of the suspension of the strains was adjusted to 104\u2013106 CFU/ml. the liquid contents of the wells were removed from the test solution for 10-fold serial dilution with DMSO. the solution containing no essential oil served as a control. the bacterial cell suspension in saline with no essential oil treatment served as a negative control. the concentrations of total free K+ in the cell suspensions were measured using a K+ ion selective electrode, as previously described by Cox et al. the mice were administered with the bacterial pathogens nasally via dropping 20 l inoculum containing 106 CFU S. pyogenes into each nostril (31). treatment protocol design The mice were divided into different groups, each containing 10 mice. cision and blood (2 ml) and whole lung samples were obtained and sliced into small sections (1 cm each) for bacterial cell counts and biochemical analyses of the serum. the results are presented as the means of three independent experiments. Graphpad Prism version 5.01 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA) was used to perform statistical analyses. P0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. a voucher specimen (CAU-2013-08-29-022) was deposited at the BNU Herbarium. the mass spectra electron impact (EI+) mode was set at 70 ev with an ion source temperature of 260\u00b0C. the mass spectra were recorded between a range of 50\u2013500 atomic mass units. bacterial strains and culture media S. pyogenes were used in the present study. the cell suspension of microorganisms in 0.5% NaCl was adjusted to a 0.5 McFarland standard to obtain 106 colony forming units (CFUs)/ml. the overnight bacterial cultures were added to 30 ml liquid nutrient agar (Sigma-Aldrich) the contents of the tubes were then transferred onto petriplates. the final column wells contained 150 l nutrient broth and 5 l inoculum as a negative control. the MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of essential oil at which the bacteria exhibited no visible growth following 24 h incubation at 37\u00b0C. overnight culture of S. pyogenes was added to a saline solution containing 0.5% Tween-80 (Sigma-Aldrich) different concentrations of the A. vestita essential oil (5, 25 and 50 g/ml) were prepared and added to the suspension. after 12 h, the bacterial cells were centrifuged at 15,000 g for 20 min. six newborn mice were selected as highly susceptible to bacterial infection. all in vivo experiments were performed in compliance with the guide for care and use of laboratory animals. mice were obtained from the Experimental Animal Centre of Sichuan University. group 7, SPI + grandisol (SPI-GN; 135 g/mouse) was administered orally to the mice once/day for 9 days post-infection (p.i) and twice/day for 9 days p.i. positive control was administered with two doses of ciprofloxacin. alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), urea and creatinine levels were measured. the blood samples were centrifuged at 15 000xg for 15 min. the results are expressed as the mean standard deviation. a literature review revealed that the various Artemisia essential oils contain -pinene, camphor, borneol, bornyl acetate, artemisia alcohol, 1,8-cineole, limonene, 1,8-cineole and grandisol as the major constituents. the essential oil of artemisia vestita was evaluated against a set of clinically significant, respiratory infection-causing bacterial strains. the potencies of the essential oil and the chemical constituents were assessed by measuring the inhibition zones and MIC. the results indicated that the essential oil of A. vestita and its major constituents exhibited a broad spectrum and variable degree of antibacterial activity against the various strains. in vitro experiments were performed to evaluate the antibacterial effects of the two major constituents (1,8-cineole and grandisol) these two components exhibited lower growth inhibitory effects, compared with the essential oil, on the bacterial strains, with higher MIC/MBC values. artemisia vestita essential oil (50 g/ml) induced potent leakage of K+ ions from S. pyogenes. results indicated that the leakage started immediately following the addition of A. vestita essential oil to the bacterial cultures of S. pyogenes. the effect of the oil on S. pyogenes biofilm formation was dose-dependent, exhibiting maximal inhibition at a concentration of 50 g/ml. the control and strains exposed to (B) 5, (C) 25 and (D) 50 g/ml concentrations of the oil are presented. AVEO, CN and GN exhibited negative hemocultures. ciprofloxacin-treated group exhibited negative hemocultures. the essential oil and grandisol treatment prevented the spread of infection to the blood. negative control 7.220.14 7.100.11 7.300.32 SPI, Streptococcus pyogenes-infected; AVEO, Artemisia vestita essential oil; CN, 1,8-cineole; GN, grandisol; Cip, ciprofloxacin; CFU, colony-forming units. 665.235.1 642.251.2 3.10.5 3.50.3 3.60.2 SPI-AVEO (100 g-24 h) 4.41.2 6.00.1 4.61.3 107.612.6 102.215.1 95.217.5 590.145.1 580.530.9 652.536.1 3.90.3 3.20.1 3.50.2 SPI-AVEO (100 g-12 h) 96.6% of the total oil composition were identified in the essential oil of artemisia vestita. a literature review revealed that the various Artemisia essential oils contain -pinene, camphor, borneol, bornyl acetate, artemisia alcohol, 1,8-cineole, limonene, 1,8-cineole and grandisol as the major constituents. ia vestita essential oil and its major constituents, 1,8-cineole and grandisol, were evaluated against a set of clinically significant, respiratory infection-causing bacterial strains. the potencies of the essential oil and the chemical constituents were assessed by measuring the inhibition zones and MIC. the results indicated that the essential oil exhibited a broad spectrum and variable degree of antibacterial activity against the various strains. in vitro experiments were performed to evaluate the antibacterial effects of the two major constituents (1,8-cineole and grandisol) these two components showed lower growth inhibitory effects, compared with the essential oil, on the bacterial strains, with higher MIC/MBC values. an oil concentration of 50 g/ml had a bactericidal effect on the pathogen population. an oil concentration of 50 g/ml had a bactericidal effect on the pathogen population. 99% of the bacteria died in 4 h. a total of three different concentrations of the oil (5, 25 and 50 g/ml) were used and it was revealed that 50 g/ml oil restricted the attachment of bacterial cells of S. pyogenes significantly. the effect of the oil on biofilm formation was dose-dependent. the antibacterial efficacy of the essential oil and grandisol was improved when administered twice/day compared with administration once/day. at lower doses, the essential oil and grandisol were therapeutically less effective against the bacteria. the ciprofloxacin-treated group exhibited negative hemocultures. negative control 7.220.14 7.100.11 7.300.32 SPI, Streptococcus pyogenes-infected; AVEO, Artemisia vestita essential oil; CN, 1,8-cineole; GN, grandisol/mouse. intake of essential oil (100 g/mouse) once or twice/day for 9 days produced no toxicity.
