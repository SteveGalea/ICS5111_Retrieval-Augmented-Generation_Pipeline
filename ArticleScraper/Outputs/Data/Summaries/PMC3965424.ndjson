{"summary": "a small but increasing number of reports have characterized some aspects of ARV infection. however, global changes in protein expression in host cells have not been examined. proteomics profiles of DF-1 chicken fibroblast cells infected with ARV strain S1133 were analyzed. proteomics data provide valuable information about host cell responses to ARV infection. the primary method to control ARV infection in chickens is vaccination. the vaccines do not protect animals from all antigenic subtypes. proteomic approaches incorporating two-dimensional differential-image gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) coupled with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) provide a comprehensive view of protein profiles of virus-infected host cells as well as insight into the molecular pathogenesis of viral infection. proteins identified through this approach may also represent potential drug targets for antiviral therapy. gated goat anti-mouse IgG and goat anti-rabbit IgG were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA) the DF-1 cell line derived from chicken embryo fibroblasts was obtained from Dr. C. H. Wang, Department of Veterinary Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taiwan. cells were infected for 2 h with ARV (MOI, 5) and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C. cells were fixed with PBS containing 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde. permeated cells were washed with PBS and permeated in PBS containing 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100. protein samples from mock-infected and AVR-infected cells were labeled with 375 pmol N-hydroxyl succinimidyl ester derivatives of fluorescent cyanine dye Cy3 or Cy5. a pooled internal standard containing equal amounts of the two samples in 2D gel 1 was labeled with Cy2 (2.5 pmol/g protein), and 50 g combined with the control and ARV-infected protein samples. mixed samples containing 50 g each of Cy2-labeled pooled protein standard, Cy3- or Cy5-labeled proteins from ARV-infected cells, and Cy3- or Cy5-labeled proteins from mock-infected cells were analyzed in the indicated combinations. mixed samples were reduced with dithiothreitol for 10 min. protein staining was used to visualize CyDye-labeled proteins in the 2D gels. gels were fixed in 2% (v/v) phosphoric acid, 30% (v/v) ethanol overnight at room temperature. gels were stained in coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 (colloidal, 0.5 g/l; ThermoFisher Scientific, New York, NY) for 5\u20137 days. supernatants were collected and peptides were extracted twice with 5% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile. peptides were pooled, dried under vacuum, resuspended in 5 l double-distilled H2O. psin autolysis peaks at m/z 842.51 and 2211.10 were used to generate a peptide mass fingerprint that was searched against the updated Swiss-Prot/TrEMBL database. peptide mass fingerprint was accepted based on significant Mascot MOWSE scores (p0.05), spectrum annotation. Membranes were washed three times with TBST, then incubated with horseradish peroxidaseconjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. secondary antibodies for immunofluorescence analysis, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanateconjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and fluorescein isothiocyanateconjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich DF-1 cells were seeded onto 10-cm2 tissue culture dishes (Nunc, Rochester, NY) and grown until the monolayer was 70\u201380% confluent. the cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and infected with ARV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI of 5 [17]. cells were infected for 2 h with ARV (MOI, 5) and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C. cells were fixed with PBS containing 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde for 25 min. permeated cells were washed with PBS and permeated in PBS containing 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 10 min. protein samples from mock-infected and AVR-infected cells were labeled with 375 pmol N-hydroxyl succinimidyl ester derivatives of fluorescent cyanine dyes. a pooled internal standard containing equal amounts of the two protein samples in 2D gel 1 was labeled with Cy2 (2.5 pmol/g protein), and 50 g was combined with the control and ARV-infected protein samples. mixed samples containing 50 g each of Cy2-labeled pooled protein standard, Cy3- or Cy5-labeled proteins from ARV-infected cells, and Cy3- or Cy5-labeled proteins from mock-infected cells were analyzed in the indicated combinations. mixed samples were reduced with dithiothreitol for 10 min. protein staining was used to visualize CyDye-labeled proteins in the 2D gels. gels were fixed in 2% (v/v) phosphoric acid, 30% (v/v) ethanol overnight at room temperature. gels were stained in coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 (colloidal, 0.5 g/l; ThermoFisher Scientific, New York, NY) for 5\u20137 days. supernatants were collected and peptides were extracted twice with 5% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile. the supernatants were pooled, dried under vacuum, resuspended in 5 l double-distilled H2O. peaks in mass range of m/z 800 to 3000 were used to generate a peptide mass fingerprint that was searched against the updated Swiss-Prot/TrEMBL database. identification was accepted based on significant Mascot MOWSE scores (p0.05), spectrum annotation, and observed versus expected molecular weight and isoelectric point (pI) Membranes were washed three times with TBST, then incubated with horseradish peroxidaseconjugated goat anti-mouse IgG or goat anti-rabbit IgG at 4\u00b0C for 1 h. at 24 h PI, only slight viral protein signals were detected in ARV-infected cells. at 72 h PI, the morphology of ARV-infected cells was clearly disrupted, and F-actin infected DF-1 cells were visualized using mouse monoclonal anti-F-actin (green), and viral proteins were detected using mouse polyclonal anti-ARV (red). BD- or mock-infected cells were analyzed at (B) 24, (C) 48, and (D) 72 h post-infection. protein spots were excised from gels, triedpsinized, and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. of the 98 protein spots, 65 were successfully identified. the function and subcellular localization of these proteins was determined according to matches in the Swiss-Prot/TrEMBL protein database. cytoskeletal protein vimentin was the only downregulated protein identified at 24 h PI. at 72 h PI, an additional 51 proteins were differentially expressed. the majority of protein expression changes were induced between 48 and 72 hr PI. DX4, VDAC2, PGAM1, ANAX5, SUMO3, HSPA8, HSPD1, and -tubulin was confirmed using individual polyclonal antibodies. PSMD13 was not detected by their corresponding polyclonal antibodies. PRDX6, PGAM1, ANXA5, SUMO3, HSPA8, and PSME3 were expressed at lower levels than in the control. the majority of stained cells maintained normal morphology, and their cytoskeletal structure were intact. at 48 h PI, the morphology of ARV-infected cells was clearly disrupted. Syncytium formation was also observed in ARV-infected cells at 48 h. a representative of gel 3 (control vs. 72 h PI) is shown. only protein spots that appeared in three replicate gels were quantified for statistical analysis. spots displaying a 1.5-fold difference in expression with a t-test p0.05 were visually confirmed prior to protein identification. the downregulated proteins were mostly located in the cytoplasm (31.03%), cytoskeleton (20.69%), and cytoplasm/nucleus (17.24%; Fig. 4D). the downregulated proteins were mostly located in the cytoplasm (31.03%), cytoskeleton (20.69%), and cytoplasm/nucleus (17.24%; Fig. 4D). the presence of PRDX6, PRDX4, VDAC2, PGAM1, ANAX5, SUMO3, HSPA8, HSPD1, and -tubulin was confirmed using individual polyclonal antibodies. the presence of PRDX6, PRDX4, VDAC2, PGAM1, ANAX5, SUMO3, HSPA8, HSPD1, and -tubulin was confirmed using individual polyclonal antibodies. fected DF-1 cells at 24, 48, and 72 h PI were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis using antibodies against the indicated proteins PRDX6, PRDX4, VDAC2, PGAM1, ANXA5, SUMO3, HSPA8, and PSME3. the current study is the first to use 2D-DIGE coupled with MALDI-TOF MS to identify differentially expressed protein profiles in ARV-infected cells. our immunofluorescence analysis showed that the cellular actin cytoskeleton of DF-1 cells was dramatically restructured/disordered at 48 and 72 h after ARV infection. overexpression of chicken SDOS in NIH 3T3 cells enhances cell spreading and formation of actin stress fibers. MAPRE1 can interact with the C terminus of adenomatous polyposis coli protein to promote microtubule polymerization. upregulation of energy-associated proteins may promote ARV replication. other proteins involved in the glycolysis pathway were downregulated in DF-1 cells. previous studies have proposed that ARV triggers autophagy in infected host cells through activation of the p53 signaling pathway. RNA processing and translation machinery Viral hijacking of the host cell mRNA processing and translation apparatus is critical for replication of many viruses [12], [42]. the findings raise the interesting question of whether GAPDH is involved in these non-glycolytic activities during ARV infection. proteasome activator complex subunit (PSME3), proteasome (prosome, macropain) subunit type 3 (PSMA3) and 26S proteasome non-ATPase regulatory subunit 13 (PSMD13) downregulation of PSME3 suggests that ARV infection likely reduces MDM2-dependent degradation of p53 in DF-1 cells and promotes apoptosis. upregulation of PRDX4 has been detected in respiratory syncytial virus-infected human pulmonary epithelial cells. this suggests that PRDX4 may play an important role to protect nuclear proteins against respiratory syncytial virus-induced oxidative stress. HSPD1 is a mitochondrial chaperonin that promotes pro-caspase-3 maturation. pro-apoptotic protein VDAC2 regulates cell permeability. a viral protein from another chicken dsRNA virus, IBDV, has also been shown to induce apoptosis in DF-1 cells through interaction with VDAC2. actin (cytoplasmic type 5) and syndesmos (SDOS) were upregulated in ARV-infected cells. vinculin, vimentin, microtubule-associated protein RP/EB family member 1 (MAPRE1), F-actin-capping protein subunit isoform 1 and 2 (CAPZB) and translationally controlled tumor protein were downregulated. TCTP binds tubulin [37], acts as an anti-apoptotic factor [38] and is downregulated in herpes simplex virus-1 infected cells [39]. energy production and metabolism Ours is the first study to show the dynamic effects of ARV on host cell metabolism. a key glycolytic enzyme, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), was upregulated in ARV-infected host cells. this enzyme participates in oxidation of d-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to 3-phospho-d-glyceroyl phosphate and reduction of NAD+ to NADH. this suggests that upregulation of GAPDH may not only promote energy production but also serve to overcome upregulation of RPSA has also been observed in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus- and IBDV-infected cells. this suggests that it may play a role in the viral multiplication process in host cells. the UPP plays important roles in apoptosis, cell cycle control, signal transduction, and transcriptional regulation. downregulated peroxiredoxin-6 (PRDX6) and upregulated peroxiredoxin-4 (PRDX4) were observed during ARV infection. previous study indicated that transfection of liver cells with PRDX6 siRNA resulted in a rise in peroxide-induced cytotoxicity by apoptosis. the downregulation of PRDX6 here we observed suggests that ARV infection decreases the anti-apoptotic function for PRDX6. downregulated ANXA5 and SUMO3 at late stage of ARV infection is still unclear. one apoptosis-related protein was downregulated by ARV infection (YWHAB) and several others were upregulated. HSPD1 is a mitochondrial chaperonin that promotes pro-caspase-3 maturation. this proteomic approach based on 2D-DIGE and MALDI-TOF MS identified 65 differentially expressed proteins in cultured chicken fibroblasts during ARV infection. proteins identified in this study may play important roles in viral pathogenesis and may become potential therapeutic targets."}
