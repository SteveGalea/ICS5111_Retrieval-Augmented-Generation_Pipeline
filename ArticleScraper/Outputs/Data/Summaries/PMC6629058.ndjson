{"summary": "toroviruses have been described as enteric pathogens causing gastroenteritis and diarrhea in humans, especially in children, as well as in young domestic animals. they are enveloped, positive sense, single-stranded RNA viruses belonging to the Nidovirales order, which includes four families: arteriviridae, Roniviridae, Mesoviridae and Coronaviridae. the rest of the viral genome harbors ORFs encoding structural proteins. spike (S) [16, 17], membrane (M) [18, 19], hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) [20, 22], and nucleocapsid (N) [14, 23], which are individually expressed from a nested set of 3\u2019-coterminal subgenomic mRNAs. in this heterogeneous group of viruses, genome replication and transcription in autophagy pathway regulates the initiation and nucleation of autophagosome membranes. many autophagy-related genes (Atg) are involved in the formation and regulation of the autophagy pathway. many autophagy-related genes (Atg) are involved in the formation and regulation of the autophagy pathway. autophagy is induced in BEV-infected cells by monitoring both autophagy signaling proteins and the autophagic flux. results clearly indicate that this cellular pathway is irrelevant for BEV replication in tissue culture. Rabbit polyclonal (L75423) and mouse monoclonal (LC3B-6) antibodies against LC3B were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. a mouse monoclonal antibody against actin (C-4) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. lentiviral pLKO.1-puro plasmids expressing a scrambled shRNA (shRNA control) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. the retroviral pSuper.retro.puro vector containing a scrambled shRNA sequence was kindly provided by Dr. didier Trono. Membranes were blocked for 1 h in Tris-buffered saline supplemented with 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T) containing 5% non-fat dry milk. membranes were washed with TBS-T, incubated with appropriate dilutions of horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. cDNA amplification was performed on an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system otide primer pair was designed based on the gene hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT1). the housekeeping gene hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 was used for normalization. plasmids containing sequence amplified by each set of primers run in parallel were used to establish the standard curves. cells were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in PBS containing 20% FCS. after this period, coverslips were washed with PBS and incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated to either Alexa Fluor 488 or 594. images were acquired with a confocal laser scanning microscope with a step size of about 0.5 m. mCherry-GFP-LC3 E. Derm cells were transfected with the pCherry-GFP-LC3 plasmid (500 ng/well) at 24 h post-transfection, cells were mock-treated, treated with the indicated drugs or infected with BEV. at the indicated times, cells were processed for immunofluorescence analysis. puromycin was added to culture medium to reach a concentration of 2 g/ml. after 3\u20134 days selection period, cultures were maintained in regular medium. lentiviral particles produced in 293T cells (5x106 cells/100 mm dish) puromycin (2 g/ml) was added to the culture medium for the selection of transduced cells. after 3\u20134 days the cells were passaged and maintained in regular medium supplemented with 0.5 g/ml of puromycin. cDNAs were amplified by PCR using a primer for XBP1 amplification. equine torovirus strain Berne P138/72 (BEV) was used to infect E. Derm and MRC-5 cell monolayers. a multiplicity of infection of 2.5 plaque-forming units per cell (pfu/cell) was achieved by UV-irradiation. Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 3-Methyladenine (10 mM; 3-MA), wortmannin (5 M; Wn), Earle s balanced salt solution (EBSS), ammonium chloride (20 mM; NH4CL), thapsigargin (200 nM; TG) and dithiothreitol (2 mM; DTT) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. pRSV-Rev (Addgene plasmid #12253) were a gift from Dr. Didier Trono. the retroviral pSuper.retro.puro vector containing a shRNA sequence for Beclin 1 was kindly provided for Dr. William Maltese [60] RT-PCR was performed with 500 ng of RNA using a random hexamer mixture. cDNA amplification was performed on an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems) using Power SYBR Green Master Mix (Invitrogen) cell monolayers were overlaid with a 1:1 mixture of 2xDMEM and 1.9% agar. monolayers stained with a 1% crystal violet solution in 2% methanol. cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) clones expressing GFP were isolated with cloning cylinders (Sigma-Aldrich) using trypsin/EDTA. the number of cytosolic GFP-LC3 dots per cell was determined with the ImageJ software. retroviral particles produced in 293T cells (5x106 cells/100 mm dish) by cotransfection of 4 g of the lentiviral vector pKLO.1-puro plasmid. supernatants containing replication-defective retrovirus were collected, filtered through a 0.45 m filter. expressing the shRNA against Beclin 1, or pLKO.1-puro plasmid using a standard calcium phosphate transfection protocol. after 24 h, cell supernatants containing replication-defective lentiviruses were collected, filtered through a 0.45 m filter and used to transduce E. Derm cells. RNAs were also extracted from cells treated for 20 minutes with 2 mM dithiotreitol (DTT, Sigma-Aldrich) or 200 nM thapsigargin (TC, Sigma-Aldrich) the resulting cDNAs were amplified by PCR using Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen) mock-infected cells showed a LC3B II level similar to that detected in LC3 lipidation deficient Wn-treated cells. in contrast, the LC3B II/LC3B I ratio was altered in NH4CL-treated cells. western blot analysis of extracts from E. Derm cells mock-infected or infected with BEV. western blots performed with antibodies specifically recognizing LC3B, actin and the BEV N protein. we also analyzed whether the observed enhancement of the LC3B II/LC3B I ratio was dependent upon viral replication. the BEV N polypeptide was not detected in BEVi-treated cells. cells were treated for 3 h with the autophagy inhibitors 3-methyladenine (3-MA) that prevents autophagosome formation by inhibiting class III PI3K [71, 72], hydroxichoroquine (HCQ) specifically blocking lysosome-mediated proteolysis [73, 74], or with EBSS starvation medium to induce the autophagy pathway. e. Derm_GFP-LC3 cells, treated as in (B), were fixed at 8, 16 and 24 h pi. only cells with 10 or more GFP-LC3 dots were considered positive. SS- and HCQ-treated cultures showed a significant increase in the percentage of positive cells compared to that found in untreated control monolayers. this value was significantly higher in cells infected with BEV for 16 and 24 h pi. this increase could be due to the activation of the autophagy pathway by BEV. the mCherry-GFP-LC3 protein showed the expected patterns, i.e. from a diffuse localization in normal conditions (Control) to the characteristic punctate distribution in autophagy vesicles when autophagy is active. these vesicles can be non-acidic vesicles, thus displaying mCherrry (red) and GFP (green) fluorescence. phagy flux was active under starvation conditions (EBSS) a lower correlation mCherry/GFP was detected, with an r average of 0.36 0.18. despite the r value cell to cell fluctuations, there were no statistically significant differences between EBSS-treated and BEV-infected cells. MRC5 cells mock-infected or infected with BEV were collected at 8, 16 and 24 h pi. the turnover of cargo p62 protein was analyzed by Western blotting at different times pi. mock-infected cells treated for 5 h with NH4Cl (20 mM) and HCQ (17 M) or with proteasomal inhibitor epoxomicin (200 nM) were used as controls. cell extracts were analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies against LC3. a gradual increase of the relative intensity was observed at 16 and 24 h pi. a relatively low LC3B II proportion was observed in EBSS-starved cells. under these conditions, cells were infected with BEV and the corresponding supernatants collected at 16 h pi. these extracts were used to quantify extracellular virus production. beclin 1 deficient cells were generated by transducing E. Derm cells with a lentiviral vector expressing a shRNA against Beclin 1 mRNA. shRNA control cells were generated by transducing E. Derm cells with a lentiviral vector expressing a scrambled shRNA sequence. antibody recognizing the BEV N protein was also used to monitor virus infection. E. Derm cells were transduced with lentiviral vectors expressing short harping RNA against Beclin 1 (shRNA Beclin 1) or an irrelevant scrambled shRNA (shRNA Control) cells were mock-infected or infected with BEV, harvested at 16 h pi. autophagy-independent LC3 function on virus replication has been described in some nidoviruses. LC3B deficient cells were transduced with lentiviral vectors expressing shRNAs against LC3B (shRNA LC3B 1 or shRNA LC3B 4). LC3B deficient cells were mock-infected or infected with BEV. E. Derm cells mock-infected or infected with BEV were treated with NH4CL or HCQ from 3 to 8 h pi. cultures were maintained in regular culture medium until the end of the assay (18 h pi) cells were analyzed by Western blot using an anti-LC3B antibody. mock-infected cells were harvested immediately after 8 h treatments. n = 3) produced in (A) was analyzed by qRT-PCR using primers specific for the BEV N gene and the housekeeping HPRT1 respectively. blocking the autophagic flux late during infection did not significantly affect BEV N protein accumulation (S2A Fig) the amount of p62 in untreated BEV-infected cells was significantly reduced as compared with mock-infected cells (about 80% reduction) the p62 protein acts as cargo receptor for the autophagic degradation of misfolded proteins or aggregates. p62 harbors a PB1 domain known to mediate self-oligomerization. a LC3-interaction region provides selective charge of ubiquitinated substrates to the autophagosome. ization of p62 and Mpro proteins at 16 h pi was more evident in cells exhibiting compacted Mpro aggregates. these results suggest that BEV might induce selective autophagy in order to remove the excess of BEV proteins accumulated at late times pi. spliced X-box binding protein 1 (Xbp1) is activated during ER stress. Xbp1 mRNA is spliced by the inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) in response to ER stress, thus rendering the active transcription factor. RNA samples from mock- or BEV-infected cells were analyzed by RT-PCR. BEV infection results in an increase of the LC3B II/LC3B I ratio. some positive-stranded RNA viruses are capable of subverting the autophagy pathway for their benefit [65, 66]. Western blot analysis of extracts of E. Derm cells mock-infected or infected with BEV. extracts from E. Derm cells treated for 3 h with either ammonium chloride (20 mM, NH4CL) or wortmannin (5 M, Wn) were included. anti-LC3B antibody was used as infection and protein loading controls. a LC3B lipidation similar to that found in mock-infected cells and BEVi-treated cells. a BEV replication-competent virus is required to cause the accumulation of LC3B II. a criterion to studying the autophagy pathway is the redistribution of intracellular LC3 from a diffuse localization to a characteristic punctate cytoplasmic pattern (LC3 II) in autophagy vesicles. redistribution of the GFP-LC3 protein in 3-MA-treated cells. cells were mock-infected or infected with BEV. only cells with 10 or more GFP-LC3 dots were considered positive. infected cells showed a clear punctate GFP-LC3 distribution. infected cells showed a clear punctate GFP-LC3 distribution. similar assays were performed to determine the percentage of cell population harboring GFP-LC3 dots. autophagosome acidification was monitored using a vector expressing the mCherry-GFP-LC3 fusion protein. mCherry-GFP-LC3 protein showed expected patterns, i.e. from a diffuse localization in normal conditions to the characteristic punctate distribution in autophagy vesicles when autophagy is active. at 24 h post-transfection cultures were mock-infected or infected with BEV. at 16 h pi the cells were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence analysis. mCherry/GFP colocalization was assessed by determining Pearson s correlation coefficients (r0.5) mCherry-GFP-LC3 expression vector is quenched in acidic environment. mCherry signal (red) remains stable, which allows us to monitor autolysosome formation following autophagosome-lysosome fusion (A-C) western blot analysis was performed with antibodies against p62, LC3B and BEV N. a gradual increase of the relative N protein accumulation was observed during the course of infection. compared with that of mock-infected cells, was observed at 16 and 24 h pi (38% and 51% respectively) the results clearly demonstrate that BEV infection also induces autophagy in this human cell line, and that it does not block the autophagy flux. proteasome inhibitor MG132 previously established to inhibit BEV replication. reduction exceeding one log10 unit in extracellular virus titers was attained. to analyze the role of autophagy on BEV infection, E. Derm cells were pretreated during 3 h with 3-MA (10 mM), EBSS, NH4CL (20 mM), Wn (5 m) or maintained in regular medium. antibody specifically recognizing the BEV N protein was also used to monitor virus infection. LC3B I to LC3B II conversion decreased in Beclin 1 deficient cells. the remaining expression of the N viral protein was similar to those detected in mock-infected cells. supernatants produced in (A) were collected (n = 3) and used to determine extracellular viral production. E. Derm cells were transduced with lentiviral vectors expressing shRNA against LC3B, LC3B 1 or shRNA LC3B. LC3B and BEV N polypeptides were also included in the experiments. the relative amount of LC3B was significantly diminished in LC3B deficient cell lines, with a reduction of about 80\u201395% in the total amount of protein compared with control cells. however, either positive or negative modulation of this pathway does not significantly affect the infection outcome. RT-qPCR found no significant differences in the level of viral RNA accumulated in treated and untreated cells. similar results were obtained when infected cell supernatants were collected at 18 h pi and used to quantify extracellular virus production. autophagy plays a beneficial role during infection, that is related with the maturation of poliovirus particles in acidic vesicles [76] autophagy degradation was inhibited in the treated cells, showing a high accumulation of LC3B II protein compared with untreated mock-infected cells. mock- or BEV-infected E. Derm cells were treated from 12 to 18 h pi with NH4CL (20 mM), HCQ (17 M) or left untreated (Control). cell extracts collected at 18 h pi were analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies against LC3B or the BEV N protein. mock- and BEV-infected MRC5 cells were fixed at 8 and 16 h pi. they were processed for immunofluorescence using a monoclonal antibody against human LC3B and anti-Mpro antibody to monitor virus infection. p62 protein exhibits a diffuse cytoplasmic localization in mock-infected cells and cells infected for 8 h. each panel shows a general, low magnification image of cell cultures. RNA from mock- or BEV-infected E. Derm cells was extracted at the indicated times pi. RNA from mock- or BEV-infected E. Derm cells was analysed by RT-PCR. RNA from mock-infected cells mainly contain the unspliced Xbp-1 mRNA (Xbp-1U) form, although a small amount of the spliced one was also detected (Xbp-1S) however, the excess of viral proteins accumulated at BEV late pi times may be instrumental in provoking ER stress. mCherry-EGFP-LC3 fusion protein is redistributed from a diffuse cytoplasmic localization (LC3B I) to a characteristic punctate pattern in autophagy vesicles (LC3B II) late during the infection, the same effect was observed when the endogenous LC3B protein was analyzed by immunofluorescence. however, the accumulation of autophagic vacuoles can be due to both: i) autophagy induction nidovirus replication occurs at the cell cytoplasm in association with DMVs [15, 29\u201334, 84\u201386]. from a structural point of view, DMVs are highly reminiscent of autophagosomes. initial studies showed colocalization between membrane-bound replication-transcription complexes of some coronaviruses and LC3 [45] authors have suggested an autophagy-independent role for LC3 in both MHV [47] and EAV infections [53]. authors have suggested an autophagy-independent role for LC3 in both MHV [47] and EAV infections [53]. p62 acts as a cargo receptor for autophagic degradation of aggregated proteins and damaged organelles, as well as for the removal of intracellular parasites. the presence of p62 protein aggregates surrounded by the LC3 protein in close proximity to BEV Mpro was routinely found. however, direct colocalization between Mpro and LC3 was not clearly detected. autophagy induces apoptosis by the activation of PKR and phosphorylation of translation initiation factor 2-alpha (eIF2-) at the very end of the replication process, once the viral progeny is produced. the accumulation of viral proteins during the last stages of the replication process may be the primary cause of the ER stress. however, incapacity to ameliorate the stress might lead to cell death by apoptosis. the PB1 domain of p62 is involved in both self-oligomerization and aggregate formation. we hypothesize that p62 forms large aggregates with Mpro. only p62 molecules exposed on the surface of the aggregates could interact with LC3 thought its LIR domain. E. Derm cells were transduced with retroviral vectors expressing either a short harping RNA against Beclin 1 (shRNA Beclin 1-KD) or an irrelevant shRNA (shRNA Control) extracts from cells expressing Beclin 1 or Control shRNA were collected at 16 h pi and analyzed by Western blotting using the anti-Beclin 1 antibody. cells were fixed 16 h pi and processed for immunofluorescence with antibodies specific for the LC3B (green) and Mpro (red)."}
