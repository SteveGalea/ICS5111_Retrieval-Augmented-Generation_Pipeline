{"summary": "a series of such fatal diseases in humans have been confirmed or hypothesized to be caused by bat-borne viruses such as Hendra virus (HeV), Ebola virus (EBOV), Marburg virus, and coronaviruses. fetal diseases in livestock have also been associated with emerging viruses of bat origin, such as the fatal disease outbreak of pigs in china. stimulator of interferon genes (STING), an essential protein in multiple DNA sensing pathways, has a substitution in bats, compared with other mammals, that leads to decreased IFN activation [21]. however, bats possess special features to maintain an effective immune state in the absence of stimulation [22\u201324]. many of these bat MHC I molecules have a 3\u2013 or 5\u2013amino acid (aa) insertion in the 1 domain compared with other mammals [20,29] in the R. aegyptiacus genome, it is shown that 11 of the 12 MHC class I loci identified display the 3-aa insertion and only one locus without the insertion. bat MHC I genes contain a 3- or 5-aa insertion within their peptide binding groove (PBG) compared with those from a variety of other mammals. the 5-aa insertion is unique to bat sequences, while the 3-aa insertion is present in both bats and some marsupials. the full information of the MHC I molecules of these species was listed in S1 Fig and S1 Table. the sequence alignment was generated with ClustalX and ESPript. a negatively charged residue at position 59 and a positively charged residue at position 65 is a highly conserved Gly. however, 71.43% of bat MHC Is have an Asp59 or Glu59 (59D/E) at this position compared with the MHC I of humans (0%), NHP (0%), mouse (0%) and horse (0%) peptides from EBOV, MERS-CoV, and H17N10/H18N11 were also included as a positive control. the previously determined Ptal-N*01:01\u2013binding peptides derived from HeV were also included as a positive control. the binding of peptides derived from HeV (A), EBOV (B), MERS-CoV (C) and H17N10 influenza-like virus (H17N10) (D) with Ptal-N*01:01 was evaluated by co-refolding. after properly refolding, the high-absorbance peaks of the correctly refolded MHC I with the expected molecular mass of 45 kDa were eluted at the estimated the structures of Ptal-N*01:01 verify the motifs of the binding peptides derived from pathogens. the binding peptide motif of bat MHC I is extremely rare in class I binding peptide repertoires of humans and other mammals.

MERS-CoV-S3 possesses a Glu at P6, corresponding to the P6-Asn in 9-mer HeV2. the larger Glu may not be able to locate in the PBG, which leads to a flexible conformation of the MERS-CoV-S3. the curves for the unfolded fractions were determined by monitoring the CD value at 218 nm. the temperature was increased by 1\u00b0C/minute. shown are the fitting data to the denaturation curves using the Origin 8.0 program (OriginLab) the insertion induces uncommon peptide P1 anchoring in bat MHC I. the 3-aa insertion pushes residue Asp59 closer to the N terminus of the binding peptide, which leads to the extension of the negatively charged side chain of Asp59 into the PBG. the 3-aa Met52Asp53Leu54 insertion in bat MHC I is in purple. residues Trp51\u2013Gln61 of Ptal-N*01:01 (green) and Trp51\u2013Gln58 of Ptal-N*01:01(-3aa) (yellow) are shown in surface representation.

Ptal-N*01:01 can bind peptides with Leu as the P anchor. binding peptides can also possess Pro at this position. this is uncommon in the peptides bound by MHC I molecules. Fig 6.

Ptal-N*01:01 uses Pro as one of its optimal P anchors. mutation rate of Pro is only higher than Trp and Gly, respectively. mutation rate of Pro is only higher than Trp and Gly, respectively. the P2-Tyr of Ptal-N*01:01\u2013binding peptides form hydrogen bonds directly with the main chain of the -sheet on the 1-helix. the P2-Tyr of HLA-A*2402\u2013restricted peptides bind to the side chain of His70 on the 1-helix. the major residues of the B pockets of Ptal-N*01:01/HeV2 and HLA-A*2402 (PBD code: 5WXD) are shown as green and blue sticks. the hydrogen bonds are shown as red dashed lines. we synthesized 20 long peptides (11-mer to 15-mer) that were previously eluted from Ptal-N*01:01\u2013expressing cells. none of these peptides could facilitate Ptal-N*01:01 refolding in vitro. these three peptides have a typical motif of Ptal-N*01:01\u2013binding peptides. the insertion site is located at a position called 310 helix (residues 49\u201353); newly synthesized MHC I molecules complexed with 2m are poised in the endoplasmic reticulum in a peptide-receptive (PR) form, ready to bind and be stabilized in the mature peptide-loaded (PL) form. the hydrogen bond network of the A pocket could stabilize peptides with P1-Asp during peptide processing and exchange. however, high-affinity peptides are guided by initial contacts spanning both the A- and F pockets to form a prolonged interaction within the groove. insertion in the bat MHC I leads to an extension of the 1-helix. Arg65, and the fact that it is involved in solvent-exposed elements in pocket A of the MHC complex suggest that the P1-Asp acts as a surface anchor residue. this surface anchor residue was previously defined in a phosphopeptide-MHC complex [37] in which the solvent-exposed P4 phosphate moiety can enhance the stability of the peptide-MHC association. marsupial MHC I gene (Trvu-UB*01) has similar characteristics to 3-aa insertion and charge-matching residues at positions 59/65 to Ptal-N*01:01. however, the preference of the Trvu-UB*01 protein for peptides may not be similar to that of Ptal-N*01:01. the P2-Tyr of the peptides form hydrogen bonds directly with the main chain of the -sheet on the floor of the PBG of Ptal-N*01:01. in this position, the P2-Tyr of the peptides form hydrogen bonds directly with the main chain of the -sheet on the floor of the PBG of Ptal-N*01:01, which leads to a stable anchoring of the P2-Tyr. peptides with proline as a C terminus are rarely in human and other common mammals. the current research on the proteasome of bats is still blank. chain sequences were retrieved from the Immuno Polymorphism Database (IPD) and the UniProt database (www.uniprot.org) Previously deposited marsupial (opossum, tammar wallaby, koala, Tasmanian devil) and platypus MHC I transcripts were included in these analyses. the cDNAs for the heavy chain of P. alecto MHC I Ptal-N*01:01 (GenBank no.
