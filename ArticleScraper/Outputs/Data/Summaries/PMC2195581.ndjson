{"summary": "wild-type variants MS11mk expressing chromosomally encoded Opa proteins were provided by J. Swanson. only nonpiliated bacteria were used for experiments. a megaprimer was generated by PCR using the mutagenic primer and a common vector-based 3\u2032 primer. the pRSET-rev primer was removed by passing the reaction mixture through a 100-kD Centricon device (5 min at 3,000 g; Amicon) a second PCR was performed with the same template plus 17 l of the 50 l of 100-kD Centricon retentate as 3\u2032 primer and a common vector-based 5\u2032 CD66b cDNA was subcloned into eukaryotic expression vector pTracer-CMV2. all mutations were made first in the CD66b N-domain construct in pRSET-A. a silent mutation containing a ClaI site was introduced at residue 113 just downstream of the N-domain in CD66b. Chinese hamster ovary cells (Pro5) were grown in RPMI 1640/5% FCS in 25-cm2 flasks to 50% confluency. pTracer-CMV2-CD66b mutants were incubated in 2 ml DMEM/10% Nu-serum (Collaborative Biomedical Products) for 4 h at 37\u00b0C. fixed cells were incubated with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 20 min. antibodies were diluted in PBS/0.05% Tween/0.5% FCS. to detect receptor expression, cells were stained with rabbit anti-CD66 antiserum. mutagenic primer was designed containing the desired base changes flanked by at least 12 perfectly matched bases both upstream and downstream of the mutation. pRSET-rev primer was generated by PCR using a common vector-based 3\u2032 primer (pRSET-rev) a second PCR was performed with the same template plus 17 l of the 50 l of 100-kD Centricon retentate as 3\u2032 primer and a common vector-based 5\u2032 primer. the resultant PCR product was cut with EcoRI and HindIII and ligated into pRSET-A. the CD66b insert was subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pTracer-CMV2 (Invitrogen) all mutations were made first in the CD66b N-domain construct in pRSET-A. a silent mutation containing a ClaI site was introduced at residue 113 downstream of the N-domain in CD66b. Chinese hamster ovary cells (Pro5) were grown in RPMI 1640/5% FCS in 25-cm2 flasks to 50% confluency. pTracer-CMV2-CD66b mutants were incubated in 2 ml DMEM/10% Nu-serum (Collaborative Biomedical Products) containing 4 g plasmid DNA and 0.2 mg/ml DEAE-dextran. cells were stained with rabbit anti-CD66 antiserum (1:200; Dako) followed by Alexa 594\u2013conjugated goat anti\u2013rabbit (GAR) IgG (1:400; Molecular Probes, Inc.) coverslips were incubated with a mouse mAb against gonococcal LPS. mAb Kat4C was provided by H. Turley (John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK) OH-terminal half of the CD66b N-domain located the critical domain for binding of OpaB, OpaC, OpaG, and OpaI variants to the first 59 residues of CD66e. using homologue scanning, we exchanged regions and single residues between the NH2-terminal 59 residues of CD66e and CD66b. mutations in the first 11 residues of the CD66e N-domain did not influence binding of any tested Opa variant. mutations in the region comprising residues 27\u201329 (mut3) resulted in a complete loss of binding by all variants. Opa variants were incubated with E. coli lysates containing the indicated mutant (mut) CD66e N-domain. Binding was calculated by determining the signal generated by the amount of His-tagged N-domain for each variant. results represent the mean of two to four independent experiments. Lanes labeled lys indicate E. coli lysate, containing the appropriate N-domain in an amount that would be seen on the blot if 100% of the N-domain present in the lysate was bound by the gonococci. the presence of F29+S32 (mut13) did not result in detectable binding of any Opa variant. the presence of F29+S32+G41+Q44 was sufficient for binding of OpaB and OpaI variants. however, for OpaC binding an additional CD66e-derived residue (L28) was necessary, indicating a difference in binding characteristics within the OpaB, OpaC, and OpaI variants. ++ MS11 Opa variants were incubated with E. coli lysates containing the indicated mutant (mut) CD66b N-domain. Binding was calculated by determining the signal generated by the amount of His-tagged N-domain present for each variant. results represent the mean of two to four independent experiments. expression and recognition of full-length CD66b Mutants on the surface of epithelial cells. images were obtained by one exposure through a double FITC/Texas Red bandpass optical filter using a 40 objective (a\u2013d) or through a Texas Red bandpass filter using a 100 objective (e). a single mutation in CD66b (N32S) resulted in significant binding of OpaB and OpaI variants. double mutant R44Q+ N32S was indistinguishable from the N32S mutant. mutations R29F+N32S and N32S+ A41G resulted in binding of large numbers of OpaB, OpaC, and OpaI variants. mutations P28L to N32S, to R29F+N32S, or to N32S+ A41G did not affect interaction with any Opa variant. replacement of all three residues provided maximum adherence of Opa variants. a difference in binding characteristics was noted for variants expressing OpaC compared with OpaB and OpaI variants. infection experiments with recombinant MS11 Opa variants resulted in identical recognition patterns as those shown here for wild-type MS11 Opa variants. results represent the mean of two to four independent experiments. identification of CD66e N-domain Residues Critical for Binding of Opa-expressing Gonococci. blots were probed with anti-His antibody and peroxidase-conjugated protein A. recognition was defined as +. CD66a\u2013e represent native N-domain sequences between CD66b and CD66e. mutations in the first 11 residues of the CD66e N-domain did not influence binding of any tested Opa variant. the single F29R mutation (mut6) also abrogated all Opa binding. mutations in the region between residues 51 and 55 caused only a moderate decrease in Opa binding. a variants were incubated with E. coli lysates containing the indicated mutant (mut) CD66e N-domain. Binding was calculated by determining the signal generated by the amount of His-tagged N-domain for each variant, compared with the signal generated in a lane where an amount of His-tagged N-domain was loaded representing 100% binding. results represent the mean of two to four independent experiments. the presence of F29+S32 (mut13) did not result in detectable binding of any Opa variant. we added residues H27 and L28 to mut13. this molecule (mut14) also failed to bind significantly to any Opa variant. Binding was calculated by determining the signal generated by the amount of His-tagged N-domain present for each variant, compared with the signal generated in a lane where an amount of His-tagged N-domain was loaded representing 100% binding. results represent the mean of two to four independent experiments. soluble recombinant His-tagged N-domains reflect interactions taking place at the cell surface. transfectants stained positive with mAb Kat4C, which recognizes an epitope in internal CD66 domains. all transfectants stained positive with mAb Kat4C, which recognizes an epitope in internal CD66 domains. an anti-LPS antibody followed by immunogold silver staining can be distinguished by the dark rim of silver/gold precipitate covering the diplococci. infection of the various transfectants with MS11 Opa variants was evaluated by double immunofluorescence staining. a single mutation in CD66b (N32S) resulted in significant binding of OpaB, OpaC, and OpaI variants. this phenomenon was not seen with OpaC variants. the triple mutant was indistinguishable from a CD66b receptor containing the chimeric CD66e/b or the native CD66e N-domain. the triple mutant was indistinguishable from a CD66b receptor containing the native CD66e N-domain. infection experiments with recombinant MS11 Opa variants resulted in identical recognition patterns as those shown for wild-type MS11 Opa variants. results represent the mean of two to four independent experiments. opa gene family is thought to have arisen from recent gene duplication events and genetic reassortment of variable sequence domains between members of the gene family 25 27 28 29. mutation rate in the CD66 N-domain exons is twice as high as that of the adjacent intron. ligand and viral binding sites on IgSF members have been found on the GFC face of the ligand-binding domain 35 36. ligand and viral binding sites on IgSF members have been found on the GFC face of the ligand-binding domain 35 36. in CD66b, we constructed a truncated, His-tagged CD66e molecule (residues 1\u201359) and tested it for binding to Opa variants. this molecule was well expressed by E. coli but failed to bind significantly to any Opa variant. the finding that single mutations in CD66b result in functional receptor activity could suggest that in vivo isoforms of CD66b exist that will be recognized by Opa variants. binding of Opa variants to soluble CD66b N-domain mutants required more CD66e-derived residues than binding to cell surface CD66 receptors. if each mutation introduced into CD66b enhances binding affinity, then the threshold level of affinity necessary for detection will be reached sooner for the infection assay than for binding in solution. only when ICAM-1 was modified to induce dimerization could binding be detected 43 44. the glycan is required to balance an unfavorable negative charge in order to maintain an active binding configuration 47. the glycan is not itself situated in the binding face but is required to balance an unfavorable negative charge in order to maintain an active binding configuration."}
