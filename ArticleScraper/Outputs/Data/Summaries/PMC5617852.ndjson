{"summary": "the pathogens causing post-viral bacterial pneumonia vary according to the type of preceding respiratory virus. mycoplasma pneumoniae was the most frequent bacterium in patients aged 16 years, regardless of the preceding virus type. the most common bacterial pathogens found in patients with post-influenza pneumonia were Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae7,8. respiratory viral infection complicating bacterial pneumonia is associated with a worse prognosis and high mortality rate compared with respiratory viral infection only 9. the predominant bacterial species causing pneumonia secondary to respiratory viral infections other than influenza remain unknown. post-viral pneumonia was defined as the presence of pneumonia in a patient with respiratory viral infection. the results of the following tests performed within 48 hours of the hospital visit were investigated for patients with virus positivity and (radiological) pneumonia (i.e., post-viral pneumonia) statistical analysis Categorical variables are expressed as numbers and percentages. independent t test was used to evaluate statistical significance. primary study subjects were 5,298 patients who underwent multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction. post-viral bacterial pneumonia was defined as the above (post-viral pneumonia) plus simultaneous detection of pathogenic bacteria in a respiratory specimen. results of the following tests performed within 48 hours of the hospital visit were investigated for patients with virus positivity and (radiological) pneumonia. respiratory viruses were detected in 3,328 of the 5,298 patients (62.8%) by multiplex real-time PCR. of the 3,328 patients, 704 (21.2%) were diagnosed with post-viral pneumonia according to chest radiography and/or chest CT findings. 233 of the 704 patients (33.1%) with pneumonia were identified. hMPV: human metapneumovirus; RSV: respiratory syncytial virus. infections caused by coronavirus, type A influenza virus, hMPV, human rhinovirus, and RSV occurred not only in infants and children but also in adults aged 60 to 80 years. infections caused by adenovirus, coronavirus, type A influenza virus, and RSV occurred mainly in winter. those caused by bocavirus and hMPV occurred most commonly in spring. parainfluenza infection occurred most commonly in spring and summer. post-viral pneumonia (n=471) and bacterial pneumonia (p0.001) were associated with respiratory viral infection. in the 16 year age group, there were 61 boys (47.0%) and 69 girls (53.0%), while in the 16 year age group, there were 65 men (63.0%) and 38 women (37.0%). the baseline characteristics and comorbidities for our study population are presented in Table 3. Table 3. Table 3. Baseline characteristics of 233 post-viral bacterial pneumonia patients. the groups were not mutually exclusive. in the 16 year age group, the isolated bacteria varied according to the preceding virus type (p0.001) type A influenza preceded bacterial infections with S. aureus (6/21), Klebsiella spp. (4/21), S. pneumoniae (3/21), and Acinetobacter spp. (3/21); hMPV infection preceded bacterial infections with S. aureus (4/21), Klebsiella spp. (4/21), and Acinetobacter MPV Parainfluenza virus Human rhinovirus RSV 16 years Pseudomonas spp. 2 (12.5) - 1 (16.7) 1 (20.0) - - - 2 (3.5) - Mycoplasma 14 (87.5) 8 (100) 5 (83.3) 4 (80.0) 1 (100) 7 (100) 10 (100) 53 (93.0) 22 (95.7) 2 (9.5) - 3 (12.4) - Others 2 (50.0) 1 (33.3) 5 (37.5) 2 (14.3) 3 (33.0) 3 (14.2) 4 (40.0) 4 (16.8) 7 (53.8) Total 4 (100) 3 (100) 13 (100) 21 (100) 9 (100) 21 (100) 10 (100) 13 (100) Values are presented as number (%) the most common virus identified in the present study was human rhinovirus (29.7%), followed by RSV (26.4%), parainfluenza virus (9.6%), adenovirus (9.4%), hMPV (6.3%), coronavirus (6.1%), type A influenza virus (5.6%), bocavirus (4.5%), and type B influenza virus (2.4%) (p0.001). hMPV: human metapneumovirus; RSV: respiratory syncytial virus. infections caused by coronavirus, type A influenza virus, hMPV, human rhinovirus, and adenovirus occurred not only in infants and children but also in adults aged 60 to 80 years. the most frequent pneumonia-causing virus was RSV (26.0%), followed by human rhinovirus (24.4%), hMPV (10.9%), parainfluenza virus (8.7%), type A influenza virus (8.4%), adenovirus (7.1%), coronavirus (6.3%), bocavirus (5.5%), and type B influenza virus (2.8%). patients with hMPV infections exhibited the highest incidence of post-viral pneumonia. p-value Age, yr 15.3824.96 31.3031.87 Male sex 263 (55.8) 126 (54.1) 0.687 Intensive care unit care 44 (9.3) 41 (17.6) 0.002 Ventilator care 32 (6.8) 29 (12.4) 0.015 Death 24 (5.1) 22 (9.4) 0.035 Values are presented as meanSD or number (%) in the 16 year age group, M. pneumoniae was the most frequently identified bacterium, regardless of the preceding virus type (p=0.630) in the 16 year age group, the isolated bacteria varied according to the preceding virus type (p0.001) hMPV infection preceded bacterial infections with S. aureus (4/21), Klebsiella spp. (4/21), and Acinetobacter spp. (4/21); human rhinovirus infection preceded bacterial infections with S. aureus (7/24), Klebsiella spp. (3/24), C. pneumoniae (3/24), and Pseudomonas spp. (2/13); and parainfluenza virus infection preceded 10 (100) 57 (100) 23 (100) 16 years Acinetobacter spp. - - 3 (23.1) 3 (14.3) 2 (22.0) 4 (19.0) 2 (20.0) 2 (8.4) 3 (23.1) Streptococcus pneumoniae spp. - 1 (33.3) - 3 (14.3) 2 (22.0) 2 (9.5) - - - Enterobacter spp. - - - - - - bacterial pneumonia in adults with respiratory viral infection is associated with a poor prognosis and increased mortality. the cause of bacterial pneumonia in adults with respiratory viral infection varies according to the type of the preceding virus. hMPV was associated with the highest incidence of post-viral pneumonia, while type B influenza virus was associated with the highest rate of post-viral bacterial pneumonia. hMPV was associated with the highest incidence of post-viral pneumonia, while type B influenza was associated with the highest rate of post-viral bacterial pneumonia. hMPV infection preceded pneumonia caused by S. aureus, Klebsiella spp., and Acinetobacter spp. pneumonia in patients with influenza virus (type A/B), rhinovirus, and hMPV infections was caused by similar bacteria. asymptomatic adults and 183 adult patients reported significantly higher detection rates for influenza virus, RSV, and hMPV in patients with pneumonia. hMPV can cause more serious diseases, such as pneumonia and ARDS, compared with influenza virus. however, research on hMPV, including the development therapeutic agents, is urgently required. the present study showed that postviral bacterial pneumonia-causing pathogens differ according to the type of the culprit respiratory virus. the findings are significant because of the lack of previous research on the etiology of secondary bacterial pneumonia in patients with respiratory virus infections other than influenza."}
