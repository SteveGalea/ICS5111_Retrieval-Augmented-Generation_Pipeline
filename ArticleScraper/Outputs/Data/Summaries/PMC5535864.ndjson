{"summary": "more than 75% of the human genome is actively transcribed into non-coding RNAs (ncRNA), which is a stark contrast to the 1\u20132% of the genome that is protein coding. ncRNAs are comprised of both small RNAs, including but not limited to micro RNA (miRNA), piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA), small interfering RNA (siRNA), small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA), and transfer RNA lncRNAs can act as signals of developmental stages, transcriptional regulation or specific locations. lncRNAs can act by binding a target protein, preventing the protein from performing its normal function. lncRNAs play an important role in regulating gene expression in utero. the long-term impact on offspring health results from foetal programming which heightens risk of developing non-communicable diseases later in life. identifying how these pregnancy complications arise is a critical step for prevention. identifying how these pregnancy complications arise is a critical step for prevention. placenta increta/percreta MALAT1 Upregulated, increase trophoblast invasion [29] IUGR NEAT1 Upregulated, disrupts formation of paraspeckles [30] H19 Downregulated, hypermethylated promoter [31,32,33] PE, preeclampsia; EOPE, early onset preeclampsia; HELLP, haemolysis elevated liver enzymes low platelets syndrome; IUGR, intrauter 1449 differentially expressed lncRNAs were identified from chorionic villi tissue from recurrent miscarriages compared to normal pregnancy. some pathways represented by these differentially expressed lncRNAs included immunity, steroid hormone biosynthesis and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-) signalling pathway. a comparison of placentas from 25 control and 25 PE pregnancies found a 2.8-fold increase in the expression of the lncRNA SPRY4-IT1. SPRY4-IT1 has been linked to the formation of endothelial cell-like tubular networks. lncRNA RP11-465L10.10 was found to be downregulated in placentas from cases of EOPE, along with its target gene MMP9. placentas from preterm pregnancies show significantly lower expression of MALAT1 compared to control placentas. placentas from women with placenta increta/percreta show significantly higher expression of MALAT1. the loss of expression of MALAT1 in placentas may lead to an overly invasive trophoblast phenotype. LINC-HELLP is found within both the nucleus and cytoplasm of first trimester extravillous cytotrophoblast cells. lncRNA plays an important role in trophoblast proliferation and invasion. mutations in LINC-HELLP can reduce differentiation of extravillous trophoblast cells. IUGR is a significant risk factor for adult onset non-communicable diseases. IUGR is also known to be a significant risk factor for adult onset non-communicable diseases. nancies and up to 50% of recurrent pregnancy losses have no identifiable cause. up to 50% of first trimester miscarriage is associated with aneuploidy and chromosome translocations while other factors include maternal age, obesity, thrombophilia, smoking, alcohol use, endocrine and immune parameters. lncRNA microarray comparison of placentas from PE and control pregnancies showed 738 (259 up and 479 down) lncRNAs were differentially expressed in placenta from PE. lncRNA microarray comparison of placentas from 25 control and 25 PE pregnancies found a 2.8-fold increase in the expression of the lncRNA SPRY4-IT1. lncRNA RP11-465L10.10 was found to be downregulated in placentas from cases of EOPE. lncRNA RP11-465L10.10 was found to be downregulated in placentas from cases of EOPE. 80% of the lncRNA probes on the microarray were identified as being differentially expressed. placenta increta/percreta may lead to an overly invasive trophoblast phenotype. altered MALAT1 expression has only been shown after trophoblast invasion. LINC-HELLP is a 205-kb lncRNA located within a genomic region linked to familial HELLP syndrome in Dutch women. LINC-HELLP knockdown followed by RNA-Seq shows a massive reduction in gene expression. it is unclear whether this interaction is a specific function of particular lncRNAs or if it is a coincidental interaction due to the RNA binding nature of the ribosome. isoforms of the lncRNA NEAT1, NEAT1_1 and NEAT1_2 are required for the formation of paraspeckles. NEAT1 functions by retaining hyper-edited mRNAs in the nucleus. paraspeckles are sub nuclear regions where transcription and pre-mRNA transcript processing occurs. gene methylation of exon 1 of H19 in placenta shows significant increase across gestation, from the first trimester to term. hypermethylation of this single CpG site is lower at three specific CpG sites in placentas from pregnancies complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus. increased H19 expression is restricted to intermediate and villous cytotrophoblasts. this expression pattern is consistent with the idea that H19 helps regulate the invasive properties of intermediate trophoblasts in the human placenta. otide polymorphism rs2071094 in H19 has also been shown to associate with increased birth weight. both a significant increase in H19 and decrease in IGF2 expression have been observed in placentas from pregnancies with assisted reproductive technology (ART) pregnancies. o is a cell line derived from first trimester extravillous cytotrophoblast cells. siRNA knockdown leads to reduced ability of cells to form tube like networks reminiscent of endothelial tubes. overexpression of SPRY4-IT1 leads to a large reduction in migration. -catenin signalling is important for maintaining epithelial phenotype and cell\u2013cell junctions. loss of this pathway leads to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) cytotrophoblast cells undergo EMT which is the critical first step for their invasion of the maternal decidua and remodelling of the spiral arterioles. 00629 are two long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) found on the X chromosome between HPRT1 and PLAC1. expression of MIR503HG is similar to that of PLAC1 with expression found in placenta. LINC00629 is expressed in the placenta, ovary, cervix, testis and heart. lncRNAs are important for trophoblast cell functions, from proliferation, invasion and migration to cell cycle progression. lncRNAs are important for a number of critical trophoblast cell functions, from proliferation, invasion and migration to cell cycle progression. a majority influence proliferation and migration, and potentially lead to pregnancy complications. link between lncRNAs and the Placental Immune/Inflammatory Functions The placenta and the foetus are foreign to the maternal immune system. lncRHOFX1 is a newly-discovered 4.8-kb lncRNA located on the X chromosome. lncRHOFX1 is expressed highly within syncytio- and extravillous cytotrophoblast (EVTs) cells obtained by differentiating human embryonic stem cells in an in vitro culture model. lncRHOFX1 localises to nuclear paraspeckles but it is not known if these speckles are also positive for NEAT1. lncRNAs are involved in many different cellular and gene regulatory networks. this is compounded by the cell type-specific function that a number of lncRNAs exhibit. this is compounded by the cell type-specific function that a number of lncRNAs exhibit. lncRNA expression and function in the placenta, trophoblast cells, and how altered expression of several lncRNAs is linked to pregnancy complications. increasing our understanding of lncRNA function in normal placental development will be critical to unravelling the complex pathogenesis of pregnancy complications."}
