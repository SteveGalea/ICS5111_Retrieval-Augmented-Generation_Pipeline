{"summary": "PDCoVs belong to the deltacoronavirus genus of the Coronaviridae family. piglets with PDCoV (2) showed clinical symptoms similar to those of porcine epidemic diarrhea. PDCoVs were reported in many countries, including china, the united states, and Thailand (3\u20137) two full-length genomes of the DH farm PDCoVs (DH1/2016 and DH2/2016) were characterized. lengths of the two complete genomes were 25,422 nucleotides (nt) and they were 100% homologous to each other. phylogenetic analysis based on full-length genomes of 65 isolates available in GenBank. complete genome sequences (DH1/2016 and DH2/2016) have been deposited to GenBank under the accession numbers KY354363 and KY354364."}
