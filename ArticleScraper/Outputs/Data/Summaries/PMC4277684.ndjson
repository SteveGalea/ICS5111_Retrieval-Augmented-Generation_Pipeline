{"summary": "new technologies have been developed to inactivate pathogens that reside in human blood products for the purpose of transfusion. but there is still residual risk to blood safety. pathogens in regions previously not endemic to such infections can also emerge. the majority of PRTs are designed to target nucleic acids of pathogens to disrupt their functionality because platelets, plasma and red blood cells do not require genomic DNA to be viable. however, secondary damage can also be incurred by proteins and membrane molecules, potentially leading to a degradation of blood product quality. two types of reactions are known to occur after activation of the photosensitizer. these reactions involve direct electron transfer between the photosensitizer and the target (in this case DNA) these reactions typically result in the formation of ion radicals, which can then propagate in further chemical reactions, ultimately resulting in reduction of the pathogen load. in the presence of visible wavelengths of light, both type I (redox) and type II (photo-oxidative) reactions can occur 27. the result of MB activation can lead to predominantly guanosine oxidation via a type II pathway. these changes in DNA ultimately prevent the replication of pathogens. the blueflex MB removal filter from Macopharma is used to reduce the residual MB concentration down to 0.1\u20130.3 m 28. MB is a phenothiazine derivative and therefore, it has a phenothiazine derivative. MB is only effective as a pathogen reducing agent in plasma. theraflex claims efficient virus reduction for human immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), Cytomegalovirus (CMV), West Nile Virus (WNV), Parvovirus B19 and others. MB is also known to bind to viral core proteins 27. ANSM saw a greater incidence of allergic reactions with MB plasma than with other types of plasma as well as a greater variability in the concentration of fibrinogen in MB plasma compared to the other types of plasma. Macopharma has decided to carry out a retrospective post marketing surveillance study in order to demonstrate the safety and efficiency of THERAFLEX MB-Plasma 34. photoactivated amotosalen forms a covalent adduct with either thymidine or adenine to form single adducts that force helical unwinding of the nucleic acid molecule. after UVA activation, covalent cross-links are formed to pyrimidines in both RNA and DNA using sequential [2 + 2] cycloaddition reactions. approximately 20% of amotosalen remains in the product, while 80% is photo-degraded. blood products must be filtered to remove the psoralen compound and some photoproducts using a CAD. the CAD device effectively reduces levels of residual S-59 by 74- to 84-fold. in vitro studies have demonstrated inhibition of replication and cytokine synthesis of IL-8 and IL-1 following treatment. INTERCEPT has been approved for use in place of gamma irradiation to treat platelets in order to prevent transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease. riboflavin is metabolized to flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and to flavin mononucleotide (FMN) the photochemical mechanism of action of riboflavin is mediated by both Type I and Type II redox reactions. the primary photoproduct of riboflavin under these conditions is lumichrome, though other intermediate metabolic and/or photochemical degradation products have been identified. the system illuminates the platelet or plasma product with 6.24 J mL1 of UV light (280\u2013400 nm) and illuminates the whole blood product to 80 J mLRBC1 of UV light. there is no toxicological concern about transfusion of UV treated blood in the presence of riboflavin. a selection of Gram-positive bacteria (e.g. Plasmodium falciparum 51, Trypanosoma cruzi 52, and Leishmania donovani 53) the Mirasol System treatment can also be used in combination with leukoreduction can be used instead of CMV testing to prevent transfusion-transmitted CMV infection 55. there was no allo-antibody formation in a rat transfusion model 59. the process only uses UVC (254 nm) as the pathogen inactivating source. this makes it a simple process from a pharmacological standpoint. the THERAFLEX UV-Platelets system is currently under clinical evaluation. it may be used to replace gamma irradiation to prevent TA-GVHD. in a mixed lymphocyte culture assay, there was no appreciable proliferation compared to untreated samples. each lot of Octaplas is manufactured from pooled plasma of a single ABO blood group (A, B, AB, or O) each lot of Octaplas is manufactured from pooled plasma of a single ABO blood group (A, B, AB, or O) each lot of Octaplas is manufactured from pooled plasma of a single ABO blood group (A, B, AB, or O) new data shows 90\u201395% recovery of the plasma protein activity using this method. filtration required to remove virus 68 has also been of great interest. filters are the only Council of Europe marked technologies to remove prions. the FRALE system uses a red cell concentrate (RCC) that undergoes leukoreduction, followed by incubation with glutathione (GSH) and S-303. the FRALE pathogen inactivation process occurs within 30 min. the S-303 must decompose over 6\u201319 h to the nonreactive byproduct S-300. the type of photosensitizing molecule dictates wavelengths of light energy required to promote photochemical reactions. methylene blue (MB) has long been used to treat methemoglobinemia through its reduction properties at low doses 15. MB is being investigated for the photodynamic treatment of cancer through DNA damage or through generation of oxidative stress. dox) and type II (photo-oxidative) reactions can occur 27. the result of MB activation can lead to predominantly guanosine oxidation via a type II pathway. these changes in DNA ultimately prevent replication of pathogens. Theraflex MB Methylene Blue Leuko-MB, Azure A, Azure B, and thionine Visible Light (590 or 630 nm), 180 J cm2 Filtration Plasma (2 years at 30\u00b0C), 3 J cm2 Filtration, post-illumination 7 Days (platelets), Plasma (2 years at 30\u00b0C) MB is a phenothiazine derivative and consequently has a high affinity for nucleic acids and as well as the surface structure theraflex claims efficient virus reduction for human immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), Cytomegalovirus (CMV), West Nile Virus (WNV), Parvovirus B19 and others. it is less effective against the picornavirus family, including Hepatitis A Virus (HAV), Poliovirus, and others. the practice of using psoralens in conjunction with UVA light to treat psoriasis was established in 1974 and continues to be an accepted clinical technique known as PUVA (psoralen + UVA) therapy 35\u201337. PUVA therapy generally refers to the use of the psoralen 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) photoactivated amotosalen forms a covalent adduct with either thymidine or adenine to form single adducts that force helical unwinding of the nucleic acid molecule. after UVA activation, covalent cross-links are formed to pyrimidines in both RNA and DNA using sequential [2 + 2] cycloaddition reactions. blood products must be filtered to remove the psoralen compound and some photoproducts using a Compound Adsorption Device (CAD) the matrix adsorbs unbound amotosalen and its photoproducts following treatment during a 4\u201316 h incubation period. the CAD device effectively reduces levels of residual S-59 by 74- to 84-fold, whereas the major photoproducts that remain unbound are reduced approximately 3-fold. ation to treat platelets in order to prevent transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease. plasma units may be used in the treatment of coagulation factor or other antithrombotic protein deficiencies. however, neonatal patients requiring plasma transfusion while being treated for hyperbilirubinemia should not receive plasma. riboflavin oxidizes guanine residues in DNA and RNA via direct electron transfer reactions. the primary photoproduct of riboflavin under these conditions is lumichrome. other intermediate metabolic and/or photochemical degradation products have been identified. riboflavin has been recognized as a GRAS compound by the FDA. no additional removal step is required after treatment; it is immediately ready for transfusion whether the treated product is platelets, plasma, or whole blood. the system uses the same technology (UV light (280\u2013400 nm) plus Riboflavin. in vitro studies with the Mirasol System have determined that T-cell proliferation is completely inhibited. treatment with the Mirasol System can be used instead of gamma irradiation to prevent TA-GVHD. the theRAFLEX-UV-Platelets system (Macopharma) is the only photoactive pathogen reduction platform. the process only uses UVC (254 nm) as the pathogen inactivating source. it can only be used to inactivate apheresis and buffy coat platelet products. methylene blue (MB) has long been used to treat methemoglobinemia. it is being investigated for the photodynamic treatment of cancer. MB is being investigated for the photodynamic treatment of cancer. the result of MB activation can lead to predominantly guanosine oxidation via a type II pathway. these changes in DNA ultimately prevent the replication of pathogens. MB is used commercially as the active compound in the Theraflex MB plasma system. Theraflex MB Methylene Blue Leuko-MB, Azure A, Azure B, and thionine Visible Light (590 or 630 nm), 180 J cm2 Filtration Plasma (2 years at 30\u00b0C) intercept Amotosalen dimers UVA (320\u2013400 nm), 3 J cm2 Filtration, post-illumination 7 Days (platelets), Plasma (2 years at 30\u00b0C) theraflex claims efficient virus reduction for human immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), Cytomegalovirus (CMV), West Nile Virus (WNV), Parvovirus B19 and others. it is less effective against the picornavirus family, including Hepatitis A Virus (HAV), Poliovirus, and others. the practice of using psoralens in conjunction with UVA light to treat psoriasis was established in 1974. PUVA therapy 35\u201337 is the predecessor to the commercially used PRT psoralen, amotosalen (S-59) from Cerus, Inc. photoactivated amotosalen forms a covalent adduct with either thymidine or adenine to form single adducts that force helical unwinding of the nucleic acid molecule. a second adduct can be formed in the presence of UVA which forms a crosslink with the original adduct. the crosslinks prevent helical unwinding and replication of the nucleic acids by polymerases 27 the matrix adsorbs unbound amotosalen and its photoproducts following treatment during a 4\u201316 h incubation period. the CAD device effectively reduces levels of residual S-59 by 74- to 84-fold. however, levels of the major photoproducts that remain unbound are reduced approximately 3-fold. in vivo, riboflavin is metabolized to flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and to flavin mononucleotide (FMN), a phosphorylated form of riboflavin. riboflavin oxidizes guanine residues in DNA and RNA via direct electron transfer reactions. the primary photoproduct of riboflavin under these conditions is lumichrome, though other intermediate metabolic and/or photochemical degradation products have been identified. riboflavin is able to penetrate the mitochondrial membrane and may facilitate mitochondrial function in its role as a flavin molecule 45. the photoproducts are present in a broad range of food and natural products. the system is also in development for treatment of Whole Blood products. it uses the same technology (UV light (280\u2013400 nm) plus Riboflavin. it illuminates the whole blood product to 80 J mLRBC1 of UV light. the dose is dependent upon the volume and hematocrit of the blood product. in vivo studies showed that the Mirasol System prevented the production of cytokines (TNF-, IL-2, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-) in response to anti CD3/CD28 or LPS stimulation. studies have shown impaired binding of Mirasol treated leukocytes to responder cells. pharmacological standpoint, as the process only uses UVC (254 nm) as the pathogen inactivating source. but due to the short wavelength of light that is attributed to UVC, it is most effective in a medium that is relatively transparent. agitation of the product during illumination is essential to ensure that blood products are homogeneously exposed to light. a solvent-detergent technique is ineffective against non-enveloped viruses 63. it can only be used to treat cellular products because the reagents would destroy the lipid bilayer of the cells. this technique is ineffective against non-enveloped viruses such as HAV, HEV and Parvovirus B19. plasma pool is treated with 1% tri(n-butyl) phosphate (TNBP) and 1% polyoxyethylene-p-t-octylphenol (Triton X-100) for 1\u20131.5 h at 30\u00b0C to inactivate enveloped viruses. TNBP is used to remove lipids from pathogen membranes and disrupts lipid bilayers 67. FRALE (S-303) is a molecule composed of an acridine moiety that non-covalently intercalates into the nucleic acid structure of RNA and DNA. it uses the light-independent alkylating agent S-303 FRALES (Frangible Anchor Linker Effectors) as an antiviral, antibacterial and antiparasitic agent. toxicology studies have only been carried out with the parent compound, S-300. no adverse effects were observed when five times the standard dose was used to prepare RBCs that were subsequently transfused into rat and dog models 70. each lot of Octaplas is manufactured from pooled plasma of a single ABO blood group (A, B, AB, or O) the plasma pool is treated with 1% tri(n-butyl) phosphate (TNBP) and 1% polyoxyethylene-p-t-octylphenol (Triton X-100) for 1\u20131.5 h at 30\u00b0C to inactivate enveloped viruses. new data shows 90\u201395% recovery of the plasma protein activity using this method. filtration required to remove virus 68 has also been of great interest. filters are the only Council of Europe marked technologies to remove prions. the FRALE system uses a red cell concentrate (RCC) that undergoes leukoreduction, followed by incubation with glutathione (GSH) and S-303. at the end of storage of the average concentration of S-300 remaining in the product is approximately 40 m. toxicology studies have only been carried out with the parent compound, S-300. all of these technologies appear different from a chemical perspective. none of these technologies currently have been approved for commercial use in the treatment of products containing RBCs. the adoption of PRT has been gradual but steady over the past decade."}
