{"summary": "microorganism transmission via air holds an important position in nosocomial infections with viruses, bacteria, and fungi. exposure to airborne fungi, such as aspergillus, Alternaria, and Cladosporium, is related to several respiratory diseases. UVC light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are gaining popularity as an alternative technology. they are easy to incorporate into a sterilization system and do not contain mercury. they are also easy to incorporate into a sterilization system and do not contain mercury. a gradual increase in population was observed as nebulization time increased up to 5 min, beyond which no statistically significant further increase occurred (P > 0.05). Approximately 8, 7, and 5.5 log PFU/vol (27 liters) were measured after 5 min of nebulization for MS2, Q, and X174, respectively. therefore, 5 min of nebulization was chosen for further research with viruses. MMAD of the system was 2.44 m, so the viruses were easily nebulized by capture with water aerosols almost 100 times larger. surviving populations of each microorganism relative to nebulization time without UVC LED irradiation. es 0 min 1 min 3 min 5 min 10 min MS2 8.23 0.60 A 8.00 0.46 A 7.97 0.30 A 8.06 0.42 A 7.93 0.34 A Q 7.22 0.03 A 6.97 0.38 A 6.90 0.42 A 6.81 0.57 A 6.85 0.64 A X174 5.22 0.08 A 5.16 0.08 A 5.19 0.40 A 5.27 0.47 A Bacteria 0 s 15 s 30 s 45 s 60 s E. coli the forced airflow generated by the fan was ca. 96.8 m3/h (26.9 liters/s) the whole volume (27 liters) of air in the isolated chamber system was convected and circulated each second. this powerful air circulation prevented nebulized cells from settling onto the chamber floor. the experimental procedure included 5 min of nebulization, UVC treatment, and 5 min of air sampling with an AGI-30 glass impinger. the error bars indicate SDs. Surviving populations and fitted curves for E. coli O157:H7, S. Typhimurium, L. monocytogenes, and S. aureus are presented in Fig. 2. the experimental procedure included 5 min of nebulization, UVC treatment, and 5 min of air sampling with an AGI-30 glass impinger. the error bars indicate SDs. Figure 3 shows surviving populations of As. flavus and Al. japonica relative to UVC LED irradiation dosage. procedure included 15 min of nebulization, UVC treatment, and 5 min of air sampling with an AGI-30 glass impinger. error bars indicate SDs. X174 showed the highest UV sensitivity among the studied viruses. this result is consistent with a study investigating loss of viral infectivity following UVC LED water and air disinfection. as. flavus has conidia measuring 3 to 6 m and Al. japonica has conidia measuring 18 to 83 by 7 to 18 m (35, 36), so these fungi have substantially larger cells than the other microorganisms in our study. however, eukaryotes demonstrated greater UV resistance than prokaryotes, and as a consequence, inactivation rate constants had cell classification-dependent characteristics. times for bacteria and fungi were assessed in the same way and were determined to be 5 min and 15 min, respectively, for each of these groups of microorganisms. nebulizing efficacy against bacteria and fungi was dramatically decreased, to 0.1 to. surviving populations of each microorganism relative to nebulization time without UVC LED irradiation. levels of nebulized populations of each microorganism were constant in the air circulating chamber. the forced airflow generated by the fan was ca. 96.8 m3/h (26.9 liters/s), in which the whole volume (27 liters) of air in the isolated chamber system was convected and circulated each second. this powerful air circulation prevented nebulized cells from settling onto the chamber floor. MS2 lost its infectivity almost linearly with increased dosages. a 4.7-log reduction was achieved at 46 mJ/cm2 of UVC LED irradiation. X174 lost its infectivity at a much lower dosage of UV irradiation. an approximately 2.5-log reduction was achieved at a dosage of 1.5 mJ/cm2 for E. coli O157:H7, with 3- to 4.5-log reductions at 4.6 mJ/cm2 for the other bacterial pathogens. only the survival curve of S. Typhimurium showed upward concavity among the pathogenic bacteria. both fungi needed a dosage of 23 mJ/cm2 for achieving approximately 4-log reductions. a linear fitting line was developed for As. flavus, while a downward concave curve was constructed for Al. japonica. b k was determined from the first linear stage of surviving population lines applied to the log linear-tail model equation. values followed by the same letters within columns are not significantly different (P >0.05). k values were calculated for bacteria than MS2 and Q viruses. eukaryotes showed greater UV resistance than prokaryotes. eukaryotes showed greater UV resistance than prokaryotes.
