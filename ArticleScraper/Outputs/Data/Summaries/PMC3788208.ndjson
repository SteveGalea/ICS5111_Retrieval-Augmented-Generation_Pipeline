{"summary": "a new cell line was developed from P. ceylonicus species of bat. this cell line was successfully tested for the susceptibility to Chandipura and BtAdv-RLM virus isolated from bats. a female P. ceylonicus bat was collected from the institute's building floor, that was probably dehydrated and moribund. on dissection, she was found in gravid status. Embryo and body organs were removed aseptically. mycoplasma infection was screened using universal mycoplasma Detection Kit (ATCC, USA) the developed cell line was named NIV-BtEPC. the viruses used in the study were confirmed by RT-PCR before the experiments. each DNA sample of individual bats and cell lines was amplified and sequenced for two mitochondrial genes, Cytochrome b gene (cyt-b) and Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase subunit 1 (NADH1/ND1) the partial Cyt-b gene was amplified using two primers (L-14724, 5\u2019-CGA AGC TTG ATA TGA AAA ACC ATC GTT G3\u2019) and the amplified products were analyzed on 2% agarose gels in EDTA buffer. they were stained with ethidium bromide and visualized on ultraviolet transilluminator. the bands of appropriate sizes (486 bp product of Cyt-b gene and 800 bp of ND-1 gene) were recovered from the gel. culture originated from embryo divided very fast during first 8-10 passages. formation of small button like mass due to aggregation of cells was observed. after 5th passage, cell line was cryopreserved and after three days could be revived properly. the cell line was found refractory to support the growth of alphavirus (Chikungunya), flaviviruses (dengue virus- DEN-2, West Nile, Japanese encephalitis) and bunyaviruses (Chittoor, Umbre, Ingwavuma and Ganjam virus) it showed cytopathic effects only with Chandipura (rhabdoviruses) and a novel adenovirus isolated from R. NIV-BtEPC cells infected with Bat AdV showed cell rounding and cell clumping at 20X amplification. vero E6 cells infected with Bat AdV showed monolayer (arrow) at 20X amplification. DNA extraction and PCR amplification of partial Cyt-b and ND-1 genes from bat cell line and other representative bat species. nucleotide sequences showed highest homology with Pipistrellus species of bats with 86 to 87 per cent and 80 to 84 per cent for Cyt-b and ND-1 genes. next close sequence was Pteropus with 75 per cent and Pipistrellus cell line sequences with 68 per cent homology for Cyt-b and ND-1 gene. the present cell line NIV-BtEPC was selectively susceptible to rhabdo and adenoviruses. a novel adenovirus was isolated from R. leschenaulti bat21 and Nipah viral RNA was detected from P. giganteus species of bats from India."}
