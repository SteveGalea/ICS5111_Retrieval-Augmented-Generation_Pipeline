{"summary": "pathogens of particular relevance in LTRs include influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), human metapneumovirus (CoV), picornavirus (PcV), and adenovirus (1\u20133). the severity of infection is contributed to by the marked immunocompromised state of LTRs alongside impaired respiratory mucociliary clearance. a total of 2,150 articles were identified by our search strategy. titles, abstracts, and keywords of all English articles were independently reviewed by two authors. articles that did not describe viral detection methods or clinical endpoints were not considered for full text review.

(38) Prospective Cohort Flu, CoV, PcV PcV, AdV Schuurman a retrospective review of 10 LTRs with lower respiratory tract infections with RSV found that four patients (40%) had 3 AR episodes following laboratory confirmed RSV infection. a group of nine subjects with influenza experienced 1.22 episodes of acute rejection on average, compared to 1.33 episodes of acute rejection in a group of nine subjects without influenza infections. conflicting data exists in the literature regarding the association of respiratory viruses with AR in LTRs. authors postulated that respiratory viruses in general may aggravate existing lung impairments and slow recovery, but do not advance AR on their own. nearly 50% of Australian LTRs developed BOS (33) during the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza outbreak, nearly 50% developed BOS (33) in LTRs with severe CLAD, such as BOS grade 3, patients with influenza A were unable to successfully regain baseline lung functionality (16) studies have directly attributed patient mortality to incidence of respiratory viral infections (33, 41), indicating that respiratory viruses may play a role in lung transplant recipient mortality. a total of 2,150 articles were identified by our search strategy.

(33) Prospective Cohort HM a retrospective review of 10 LTRs with lower respiratory tract infections with RSV found some degree of AR in 9/15 (64%) of patients diagnosed with influenza respiratory infections (15). a group of nine subjects with influenza experienced 1.22 episodes of acute rejection on average, compared to 1.33 episodes of acute rejection in a group of nine subjects without influenza infections (23), suggesting the risk for infection with influenza may not be exacerbated. based primarily on clinical as opposed to histopathologic diagnosis (32) in another prospective study, PIV was detected in 20 lung transplant recipients with histopathologic evidence of AR in 2 (50%) of the four patients undergoing transbronchial biopsy. conflicting data exists in the literature regarding the association between respiratory viruses and AR. seven of 10 lung transplant recipients developed new or increased BOS after RSV infection (31) three RSV-positive LTRs demonstrated BOS at the time of RSV infection, and two others developed new or progressive BOS within 6 months of RSV infection (35). the pattern of influenza infection in LTRs is seasonally related to the strains of influenza virus that are prevalent. the true relationship of respiratory viruses and CLAD in LTRs is difficult to determine in medically complex LTRs. however, the viruses identified by this review as most commonly associated with mortality or patient survival were RSV and AdV. however, these infections were not associated with mortality or CLAD (42) systematic review had a number of limitations. first, as we limited the online review to studies published between 1985 and 2018, the review may have missed some early reports of respiratory virus association with lung transplant surgery. second, through our search strategy, we focused on studies that contained both a description of virus detection methods and a description of clinical endpoints. GG conceived of the idea of the review and helped revise the manuscript to add important scientific content. authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
