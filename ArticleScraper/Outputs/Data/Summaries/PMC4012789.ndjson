{"summary": "are bats special in hosting more viruses per species than rodents? the analysis indicated that bats are indeed special in hosting more viruses per species than rodents, despite twice as many rodent species in the world. ins of laboratory mice that are inbred for higher metabolic rates show stronger immune responses to immune challenge (keyhole limpet hemocyanin antigen) with stronger antigen-specific IgM production. leukocyte counts and mass of lymphatic organs that are the sources of immune cells involved in antigen recognition and elimination also are elevated in the strains with higher metabolic rates. an exception to the daily high body temperatures during flight occurs during hibernation in temperate zones. s increase the rate of multiple immune responses in mammals, including components of the innate and adaptive immune systems. Enhanced neutrophil and monocyte motility and emigration Enhanced phagocytosis and pinocytosis Increased oxygen radical production by phagocytes Increased interferon production Increased antiviral, antitumor, or antiproliferative, and natural killer cell stimulating activities of interferon Potentiated interferon-induced anti-anaphylaxis. Enhanced natural killer complement activation Enhanced expression of Fc receptors Increased T-helper cell activation, expression, recruitment, and cytotoxic activity Blocked T-helper cell activity Increased antibody production Enhanced tumor necrosis factor- Increased T-cell proliferative response to nonspecific mitogens, interleukin-1 and 2 and allogeneic lymphocytes Increased killing of intracellular bacteria Increased bactericidal effect of antimicrobial agents Induced pathogen heat- flight may have been a potent selective factor for reduced virulence to the natural hosts seen in the pool of emerging viruses recently discovered in bats. there are few reports of mass deaths from diseases in bats despite reports of bat die-offs due largely to other causes that have appeared in the literature over the years. our \u201cflight-as-fever\u201d hypothesis suggests 1 mechanism unique to bats that might be key in the flight capability\u2013innate immunity linkage question raised by Wang et al. (11) we suggest a variety of in vivo, in vitro, and in silico approaches be considered. viruses that have been identified by using genetic techniques have not been isolated, described morphologically, or grown in culture. silico techniques of modeling and simulation would be helpful in understanding the likely co-evolution of bat viruses and their hosts."}
