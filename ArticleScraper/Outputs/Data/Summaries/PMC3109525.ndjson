{"summary": "food related illnesses in the world are estimated at 1.5 billion annually, including 76 million in the united states. 80% of the illnesses are due to food-borne viruses that include noroviruses, hepatitis A and E viruses, adenovirus (type 41 and 42), rotavirus, and other RNA viruses groups thus far surpassing food-borne illnesses due to non-viral microbial pathogens. there is an urgent need for the development of viral genome based rapid detection and identification methods for food-borne viruses with discriminatory power at the level of species and strain/genotype. microarray based methods offer one such methodological approach. initial attempts at virus detection and typing by microarray hybridization were limited to detection of known mutations in the viral genome. each probe is 25 nucleotides long and there is a 23 base-pair overlap between consecutive probes for the same virus genotype. the complete array covers 183,084 nucleotides of viral genomic sequence. the large range is due to the number and extent of independent genome sequences available for NV from GenBank. genotype, genogroup and serotype identities are given for the virus strains of hepatitis A virus, norovirus and coxsackievirus sequences, respectively, represented on the array. the single hepatitis E virus, astrovirus and sapovirus strains represented on the array do not currently have a comparable designation. hepatitis A virus strains HM-175/18f, HAS-15, PA21, and five coxsackievirus serotypes were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. clinical samples of norovirus were provided by Dr. William Burkhardt (FDA, Dauphin Island, AL) and by Dr. Jan Vinje (CDC, Atlanta, GA) cDNA was labeled with terminal Transferase (Invitrogen, CA) at 37 \u00b0C for 1 min. biotinylated cDNA in the presence of Affymetrix hybridization buffer was hybridized to the microarray chip in a total volume of 120 l. the microarray chip was then incubated at 45 \u00b0C for 16 hrs in a hybridization oven. norovirus sample #186 (NoV#186) was genotyped via RT-PCR. the amplicon was sequenced and its relationship to known noV strains was determined. a phylogenetic tree from boot-strap analysis was generated. each succeeding oligo probe starts from the third nucleotide of the preceding oligo probe. the approximately 91,000 probes can interrogate a total of 180,000 nucleotides. each probe is 25 nucleotides long and there is a 23 base-pair overlap. 71 VP3 4526 Coxsackievirus Serotype B1 1500 B2 1500 B3 1500 B4 1500 B5 1500 A2 1500 A5 1500 A7 1500 A16 1500 A24 1500 Norovirus Genogroup I 11468 Genogroup II 18736 Rotavirus Segment/Group IA 6620 IB 1770 IC 1650 IVA 4660 IVB 1128 IVC 1113 Hepatitis E virus - 1500 Astrovirus - 1500 Sapovirus - 1500 gonucleotides with a 2-nucleotide spacing were derived from the 5\u2019 end viral genomes of each virus except rotavirus. sequence representation for this virus was derived from individual genome segments and ranged from approximately 2,300 to 3,300 nucleotides. multiple sequences of partial genomes were also used as in the case of the HAV VP1-P2A junction. cDNA was labeled with terminal Transferase (Invitrogen, CA) at 37 \u00b0C for 1 min. biotinylated cDNA in the presence of Affymetrix hybridization buffer was hybridized to the microarray chip in a total volume of 120 l. the microarray chip was then incubated at 45 \u00b0C for 16 hrs in a hybridization oven. an empirical cutoff value of 3.0 was considered as a threshold value for a positive signal. hybridization data were then converted to color visualization schemes in which hybridization signal intensity is reflected by the color scale of vertical strips. a minimal degree of cross-hybridization to A16, B3, B5 and A7 were also detected. for HAV, strong hybridization signals are only observed in oligoprobes. cross-hybridization among strains is also observed. hybridization to genogroup II-specific probes derived from Saitama U17 strain with accession #AB039779 was identified in noV#186. hybridization result from HAS 15 and PA 21, respectively, when the analysis was extended over 3.7 kb from the 5\u2019 end. a mixture of labeled cDNA targets derived from their respective viruses hybridized to a single microarray. the presence of CXKV B3 target and NoV#3263 can be readily identified by their strong hybridization to the set of oligoprobes derived from their individual genera sequence of CXKVB3 and L07418, respectively. in Fig. (4A, B), we show that the analysis can be expanded over thousands of nucleotides of multiple viral genomes. the first 3700 nucleotides of each virus strain were interrogated. the average signal value of all oligonucleotide probes from a virus strain was plotted against the position of that probe in the array. no nucleotide changes are present in the region between HM175/wt and18f. re-sequencing microarrays can identify base changes in an emerging strain by interrogating every base in the genome. a nucleotide change in the genome is identified by comparing the hybridization profile of a test virus to that of a reference strain matching the probe sequences. microarray hybridization based techniques for the identification of known mutations in viral genomes were initially performed by synthesizing a limited number of probes based on the sequence of wild-type viral and mutated genomes. the cross-hybridization of some CXKV strains to a limited number of oligo probes from a different strain marked areas of extensive sequence homology. the specificity of the assay is exemplified by the fact that there was never any cross-hybridization detected between CXKV, HAV and norovirus probes to the non-target sequences. this approach also allows identification of pathogens whose sequences are not tiled on the array"}
