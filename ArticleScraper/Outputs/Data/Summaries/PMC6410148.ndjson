{"summary": "Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus in the family Flaviviridae. it causes microcephaly and death in congenitally exposed fetuses. there are no countermeasures available for the prevention or treatment of ZIKV infection. a signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 gene knockout (STAT2) gene knockout (KO) golden Syrian hamster. hamsters are only partially defective in type I interferon signaling, thus they are less immunocompromised than the above-mentioned mice. hamsters are highly susceptible to ZIKV infection. a virus stock was prepared by two passages in vero cells. a titer of 107.5 50% cell culture infectious doses (CCID50)/mL [10]. 2.2. production of anti-ZIKV human polyclonal antibodies SAB-155 from TcB. negative control antibodies used in this study were human polyclonal antibodies purified from the sera of the same TcB before ZIKV immunization. for infection, 70 pfu of ZIKV was administered to STAT2 KO hamsters. hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining and ZIKV-immunoreactive (ZIKV-ir) assays were determined by a plaque reduction assay. a total volume of 200 l serum with PBS and ZIKV mixture was added to each well of a twelve-well plate containing Vero 76 cells. ten microliters of 2 SensiFASTTM Probe No-ROX One-step Mix were mixed with 2 L of extracted RNA. each sample was run in duplicate and relative genome equivalents were averaged. the limit of detection was calculated based on the titer values from sham or uninfected testis tissue. 2.7. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Histology. 1/4 animal had ZIKV antigen in ST. 1/4 Negativecontrols 1 dpi Irrelevant Ab. 100 mg/kg 109 Diffusely pyogranulomatous inflammatory exudate infiltrates expand and replace the interstitium of ST. 2/4 animal had ZIKV antigen in ST. 2/4 animal died before 21 dpi. 1 dpi 100 mg/kg Below the limit of detection (105.5) No significant lesions No ZIKV infected cells found 0/6 1 dpi Irrelevant Ab. 400 mg/kg Below the limit of detection (105.5) no significant lesions No ZIKV infected cells found 0/6 1 dpi Vehicle Below the limit of detection (105.5) a plasmid DNA (pDNA) encoding a full-length ZIKV prME gene was used as a vaccine to immunize TcB. the TcB was hyperimmunized 4 times (V1\u2013V4) at 3-week intervals with the antigen at 12 mg per animal per vaccination. the testis was one of the target organs for ZIKV infection in rodents. both sexes were susceptible for disease leading to a moribund state. twenty-four hours later the tissues were rinsed in PBS and placed in 70% ethanol. the inverse of the dilution that caused a 50% reduction was reported as the 50% plaque reduction neutralization titer (PRNT50) the titer of the infectious virus was similarly determined, except that no serum was added to the sample. standard curves of ZIKV RNA and GAPDH RNA were generated with serial dilutions of synthetic RNA (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ, USA) the relative number of ZIKV RNA was determined from the standard curve and was normalized with relative total RNA calculated from the GAPDH standard curve. SAB-155 antibody treatment on testis of Zika virus infected STAT2 KO hamsters. no significant lesions 4/4 No ZIKV infected cells found 0/4 4.5 dpi 100 mg/kg 106\u20131010 Pyogranulomatous inflammatory exudate infiltrates. 6/6 animals had ZIKV antigen in ST. 6/6 4.5 dpi 400 mg/kg 105\u2013108 1/6 with a severe pyogranulomatous orchitis. 5/6 animals had ZIKV antigen in ST.1/6 animal had coagulative necrotic testis. 1/6 animal died before 21 dpi. 1 dpi Irrelevant Ab. 100 mg/kg 108 3/4 animal died before necropsy. testicles were harvested at 2, 3, and 4.5 dpi for ZIKV RNA detection and immunohistochemistry analysis. ZIKV RNA levels were significantly higher in two animals on both the right and left testis at 3 and 4.5 dpi than at 2 dpi. ZIKV can establish infections in the testis as early as 3 dpi (but not 2 dpi) three animals were processed for each time point (A\u2013C) sham infection compared with ZIKV infection. 42% (5 out of 12) animals in the control-antibody treated group succumbed. the control-antibody treated animals started to lose weight at 3 dpi. STAT2 KO hamsters exhibited conjunctivitis after ZIKV infection. a single dose of SAB-155 administered via i.p. injection at 1, 3, and 4.5 dpi prevented STAT2 KO hamsters from becoming moribund. negative control antibody treated group started to become moribund at 8 dpi. identifying effective day of treatment with single dose of 100 mg/kg of SAB-155. equal numbers of male (n = 4) and female (n = 4) STAT2 KO hamsters treated i.p. with SAB-155 at different pre-and post-infection days. STAT2 KO hamsters treated with SAB-155 at 1 and 3 dpi resulted in undetectable ZIKV RNA in their testes. high levels of ZIKV RNA were detected in the testicular tissues collected on 21 dpi. this suggests that ZIKV can cross blood-testis barrier and persistently infect seminiferous tubules. 4.5 dpi had pyogranulomatous inflammation in the interstitium and seminiferous tubules. the animal did not lose weight and survived to the end of the experimental period. STAT2 KO hamsters can be used as a non-lethal animal model to study antivirals and vaccine treatment against ZIKV infection. the detection of ZIKV RNA is consistent with the detection of pathological lesions and positive ZIKV-ir in this organ. most of the groups had equal numbers of male (n = 4) and female (n = 4) STAT2 KO hamsters s.c. infected with PRVABC69 and treated with different doses of SAB-155 at 4.5 dpi. sera were collected at 2, 3, and 4.5 dpi for detecting neutralizing antibody titers. serum viremia was also found at 3 dpi (2/3 animals) and 4.5 dpi (3/3) animals. three animals were processed for each time point (A\u2013C) tissues from both right and left testes were processed for RT-PCR (C) and representative IHC images are shown with ZIKV infection (D\u2013F). sham infection compared with sham infection. STAT2 KO hamsters exhibited conjunctivitis after ZIKV infection. 50% (6 out of 12) of control-antibody treated animals were free of conjunctivitis. 81% (9 out of 11) of SAB-155 treated animals were free of eye disease. a single dose of SAB-155 administered via i.p. injection at a dose of 100 mg/kg at 1, 3, and 4.5 dpi prevented STAT2 KO hamsters from becoming moribund. a single dose of SAB-155 administered via i.p. injection at a dose of 100 mg/kg at 1, 3, and 4.5 dpi prevented STAT2 KO hamsters from becoming moribund at 8 dpi. sham infected controls had 2 males and 2 female hamsters. survival, since five groups had 100% survival, data has been adjusted to display all groups. RT-PCR analysis of ZIKV RNA in testes of hamsters. high levels of ZIKV RNA were detected in the testicular tissues collected on 21 dpi from the surviving male hamsters treated on 4.5 dpi. this suggests that ZIKV can cross blood-testis barrier and persistently infect seminiferous tubules. one of the four animals treated at 4.5 dpi had severe pyogranulomatous inflammatory infiltrates. STAT2 KO hamsters can be used as a non-lethal animal model to study antivirals and vaccine treatment against ZIKV infection. a single treatment with higher doses of SAB-155 could eliminate testicular infection and a lower dose of SAB-155 can still prevent animals from weight loss. survival, weight loss, percentage of free disease signs and RT-PCR on ZIKV RNA were evaluated for all treatment groups. the detection of ZIKV RNA is consistent with the detection of pathological lesions and positive ZIKV-ir in this organ. most of the groups had equal numbers of male (n = 4) and female (n = 4) STAT2 KO hamsters s.c. infected with PRVABC69. adult STAT2 KO hamsters are highly susceptible to ZIKV infection. only about 50% of STAT2 KO hamsters infected by ZIKV succumbed. the onset of death was delayed a few days in the hamster. patients [23], monoclonal antibody from deNV patients [24] and ZIKV-117 mAb from human antisera [25] were tested against different strains of ZIKV virus in several mouse models. the administration of a cocktail of potent neutralizing monoclonal antibodies collected from ZIKV-infected patients completely prevented serum viremia [27]. a single dose of 100 mg/kg SAB-155 at or before 3 dpi prevented animals from being ZIKV-ir in the testis and developing histopathological lesions. a single therapeutic treatment with SAB-155 at or before 3 dpi prevented animals from being ZIKV-ir in the testis. a single treatment with SAB-155 at or before 3 dpi prevented animals from being ZIKV-ir in the testis anti-ZIKV TcB antibodies reported in this study are yet to be tested in human clinical trials to be proven effective in treating ZIKV in human infections."}
