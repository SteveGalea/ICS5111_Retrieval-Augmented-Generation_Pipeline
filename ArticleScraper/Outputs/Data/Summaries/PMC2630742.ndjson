{"summary": "230 samples of symptomatic and asymptomatic samples were collected and tested for WUPyV and KIPyV by real-time PCR. parents collected samples for virus detection by rubbing 1 nostril and posterior oropharynx of their child with separate cotton-tipped swabs. human metapneumovirus (1%); adenovirus (1%); mycoplasma pneumoniae (3%); and Chlamydophila pneumoniae (5%). samples were collected during November 2004\u2013April 2005, throughout the Netherlands. most infections with WUPyV and KIPyV were seen in the youngest children. most infections with WUPyV and KIPyV were seen in the youngest children. for a KIPyV infection, the median age was 2.6 years. we report that WUPyV and KIPyV were the only viruses found in several samples, most of them originating from symptomatic episodes. more extensive data are needed to establish their definite role in respiratory disease. that both viruses may be associated with respiratory disease. additional studies are needed to confirm the suggestion."}
