{"summary": "bronchitis is caused by infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a single stranded positive sense, enveloped RNA virus of 27\u201332 kb length. the virus is classified under the Gammacoronavirus genus in the family Coronaviridae. phosphorylated 409 amino acid of IBV-N protein is highly conserved between amino acid residues 238 and 293. spike glycoprotein plays important role in the attachment and entry of the virus into the cell via sialic acid receptors. pathogenesis Infectious bronchitis virus infects primarily the respiratory system. the extent and severity of the disease is pronounced in young chicks. resistance to infection is pronounced in young chicks, compared to adults. both lines had similar virus shedding rate. the nature of IBV persistence remains to be elucidated. detection of the virus in the caecal tonsils (up to 14 weeks) and from faeces (20 weeks) after infection might suggest a role of faecal shedding in viral transmission and persistence. clinical signs include depression, wet droppings, and excessive water intake. decline in egg production does not return to normal laying, thus contributing to high economic loss. nephropathogenic strains cause nephritis characterized by swelling and congestion of the kidney. infection with bacterial pathogens such as E. coli may lead to a more complex outcome, usually associated with high morbidity and mortality. nephropathogenic IBV strain causes high mortality, compared with strains infecting only the respiratory or reproductive systems. other IBV-like coronaviruses have been identified in nondomestic avian species including pheasant. antibodies to IBV have been demonstrated in humans with close contact to poultry, but the virus has not been reported to cause human clinical disease. resistance to infection was suggested to increase with increasing age. virus is transmitted via the respiratory secretions, as well as faecal droplets from infected poultry. evidence of virus was shown in trachea, kidney, and bursa of Fabricius 24 hrs following aerosol transmission. clinical outcomes associated with IB infection include frothy conjunctivitis, profuse lacrimation, oedema, and cellulitis of periorbital tissues. infected birds may also appear lethargic, with evidence of dyspnoea and reluctance to move. nephropathogenic IBV strains cause nephritis characterized by swelling and congestion of the kidney. nephropathogenic IBV strains cause nephritis characterized by swelling and congestion of the kidney. Cystic oviduct in chicken experimentally infected with a CR88 infectious bronchitis virus strain. nephropathogenic IBV strain causes high mortality, compared with strains infecting only the respiratory or reproductive systems. emergence of different IBV serotypes that do not cross-react with commonly available antisera generally made serological tests less applicable. emergence of different IBV serotypes that do not cross-react with commonly available antisera generally made serological tests less applicable and nonconclusive in classifying new or emerging IBV isolates. allantoic fluid (AF) is harvested from representative eggs that were chilled overnight and tested for the presence of IBV. after 48\u201372 hrs, inoculated eggs are opened and observed for characteristic IB lesions such as dwarfism of the infected embryo. tracheal rings of 20-day-old chicken embryo are kept in a roller bottle and infected with IBV-suspected samples. successful growth of IBV has been demonstrated in organ cultures derived from kidney, intestine, proventriculus, and oviduct. transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is a useful tool which enables visualization of virus-like particles in infected cells. this method is often applied to understand viral attachment and entry into the cell but is not a specific diagnostic test. immunohistochemistry Immunoperoxidase and immunofluorescence are two important histochemistry methods for detection and confirmation of IBV antigen from infected tissue and/or cells. assays were designed to target different regions and/or fragments in the IBV viral genome. a pan-coronavirus primer could also be used in one-step RT-PCR amplification of IBV strains. amplification and sequencing of the S1 gene provide a reliable means for genotypic classification of new IBV strains. real-time RT-PCR assays have been introduced for detecting IBV. it is possible to quantify IBV viral load from tissue and/or clinical samples by real-time RT-PCR assays based on viral copy number or fold changes. differentiation of Massachusetts from non-Massachusetts is possible by real-time RT-PCR assay targeting S1 glycoprotein gene [79, 82]. isolates are characterized through bioinformatics analyses based on their phylogenetic relatedness. lack of method standardization among laboratories limits genotyping to some extent. phylogenetic analysis based on nucleotide acid sequence of S1-spike gene of classical and variant IBV strains identified in different countries. trachea, kidney, proventriculus, tonsil, and oviduct samples must be collected aseptically from scarified chickens or immediately upon death. the stringent technique requirements and factors limit the use of virus isolation as a diagnostic method of choice for IBV infection. infected cultures are characterized by rounding, development of syncytia, and subsequent detachment from the surface of the plate. a major limitation of cell culture methods for isolation is that not all strains of IBV are easily adapted in cell culture. a study suggested the universality of using kidney, bursa, and proventriculus in growing IBV, but a poor result was obtained when propagated in cultures derived from different intestinal segments. possible constraints include lack of affinity of some IBV strain for some organ cells and difficulty in differentiating ciliostasis arising from other viruses. infected cultures are characterized by rounding, development of syncytia, and subsequent detachment from the surface of the plate. a major limitation of cell culture methods for isolation is that not all strains of IBV are easily adapted in cell culture. a poor result was obtained when IBV was propagated in cultures derived from different intestinal segments [61]. possible constraints include lack of affinity of some IBV strain for some organ cells and difficulty in differentiating ciliostasis arising from other viruses, such as Newcastle disease virus and avian adenovirus [33]. indirect immunofluorescent assay is the most frequently used fluorescent technique. molecular methods such as RT-PCR, real-time PCR, Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) and genome sequencing have nearly replaced conventional serology and virus cultivation methods of IBV diagnosis. RFLP is an IBV genotyping method carried out to differentiate different known strains of IBV. it allows differentiation of different known strains of IBV based on their unique electrophoresis banding patterns defined by restriction enzyme digestion. RFLP allows differentiation of different known strains of IBV. real-time RT-PCR was tenfold more sensitive than normal RT-PCR assays. real-time RT-PCR was tenfold more sensitive compared to virus isolation. other forms of PCR methods used in detecting IBV include nested PCR [68]. RT-PCR methods This approach uses viral RNA amplified either directly (one-step RT-PCR) or following cDNA synthesis (two-step RT-PCR) an RT-PCR assay was designed and introduced in 1991 for detecting the IBV-S2 gene [70]. a pan-coronavirus primer, targeting a conserved region of different coronavirus isolates, could also be used in one-step RT-PCR amplification of IBV strains [ RFLP allows differentiation of various known IBV strains based on their unique electrophoresis banding patterns defined by restriction enzyme digestion. the assay was found to be comparable with traditional virus neutralization assay, although some strains such as the Gray and JMK strains were reportedly difficult to differentiate using arrays of restriction enzymes. methods used in detecting IBV include nested PCR [68]; multiplex PCR [86]; and reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP [87]. lack of method standardization among laboratories limits genotyping to some extent. the poultry industry has suffered a growing number of emerging IBV serotypes. the newly evolved strains have been favoured by selection pressure, mutation, and/or recombinations. lack of effective diagnostic methods and vaccines is partly blamed for the serious economic losses as results of infectious bronchitis disease."}
