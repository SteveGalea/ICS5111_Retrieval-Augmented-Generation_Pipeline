{"summary": "herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2) are among the most prevalent human pathogens in industrialized and developing countries. HSV-2 is identified as a risk factor for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transmission and disease progression (2, 3), while HSV-1 is suspected to be a cause of Alzheimer's disease (4, 5). PDTC showed an inhibitory effect on proteasome-dependent proteolysis (15), implying that PDTC was a potential inhibitor for the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) PDTC could act as a specific inhibitor of the E3 ubiquitin ligase, targeting IB for ubiquitination to influence proteasome-mediated IB degradation. PDTC acted as an inhibitor of the UPS, preventing proteasome-mediated proteolysis of ubiquitin conjugates and IB- but also HSV-induced PML delocalization and degradation. PDTC blocked HSV replication and gene expression through dysregulation of the cellular UPS. Fluor 488-IgG, 4\u2032,6\u2032-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and FluoZin-3 AM were from Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA) antibodies for late protein gD-1/2 (gD of HSV-1 and -2), ICP0-1, ICP4-1, p53, p65, phosphorylated Jun N-terminal protein kinase 1 and 2 (p-JNK1/2 pRK-Ub-WT (plasmid number 17608; wild-type [WT] ubiquitin expression plasmid) and pRK-Ub-KO (plasmid number 17603; dominant negative [DN] ubiquitin expression plasmid) were from Addgene (Cambridge, MA) the virus titration assay could also be performed on Vero-ICP10P cells by measuring luciferase activity the wells were blocked for 90 min and incubated with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer (1:200) for 2 h. the fluorescence intensity of each well was measured by using Odyssey version 3.0 software. the protein expression level was normalized to that of -catenin. total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies) and reverse transcribed to cDNA using the ReverTra Ace quantitative reverse transcription-PCR kit (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) real-time PCR was performed in triplicate on the ABI Prism 7300 sequence detection system using SYBR green PCR master mix (Toyobo), according to the manufacturer's protocol. DA diluted in DMEM medium (10 M) after 20 min of incubation, cells were rinsed 3 times. cytoplasmic extracts were obtained by centrifugation at 12,000 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. effects of drugs on cellular 26S proteasome activity were determined. PDTC was added to the medium for 30 min, and the plate was read in the spectrofluorometer. Statistical significance was determined at P values of 0.05 and 0.01. 800 secondary antibodies were obtained from LI-COR (Lincoln, NE) antibodies for the late protein gD-1/2 (gD of HSV-1 and -2), ICP0-1, ICP4-1, p53, p65, phosphorylated Jun N-terminal protein kinase 1 and 2 (p-JNK1/2), JNK2, PML, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH ubiquitin expression plasmid and pRK-Ub-KO were from Addgene (Cambridge, MA) HSV-1(HF) and HSV-2(G) were propagated and titrated on Vero cells. the virus titration assay could also be performed on Vero-ICP10P cells. cell monolayers were inoculated in IRDye-IgG (1:1,500) for 1 h, rinsed, and scanned in the LI-COR Odyssey infrared imager. the fluorescence intensity of each well was measured by using Odyssey version 3.0 software. the protein expression level was normalized to that of -catenin. real-time PCR was performed in triplicate on the ABI Prism 7300 sequence detection system. the levels of HSV-1 ICP0 (forward, TACGTGAACAAGACTATCACGGG, and reverse, TCCATGTCCAGGATGGGC), HSV-1 ICP4 (forward, GGCCTGCTTC, and reverse, CCATCTTGAGAGGCATC), and HSV-2 ICP0 (forward, GTGCATGAAGACCTGGTC, and reverse, cytoplasmic extracts obtained by centrifugation at 12,000 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. effects of drugs on cellular 26S proteasome activity were determined. statistical significance was determined at P values of 0.05 and 0.01. RESULTS PDTC inhibited HSV-2 replication in a dose-dependent manner. PDTC inhibited HSV-2 replication in a dose-dependent manner. PDTC showed an inhibitory effect on HSV-2 replication. HEC-1-A cells were treated with serial concentrations of PDTC prior to HSV-2 infection (MOI = 1). PDTC inhibited HSV-2 replication. PDTC's antiviral property was mediated by its dithiocarbamate moiety. HEC-1-A cells were exposed to PDTC (25 g/ml) prior to infection. after 3 h of incubation, PDTC was removed by washing and complete medium was supplied. HEC-1-A cells cultured in complete medium were exposed to PDTC (25 g/ml) in the presence of serial concentrations of EDTA (A) or 10 M EDTA-Ca, -Mg, -Zn, or -Cu (B) and infected with HSV-2. each TPEN concentration was in duplicate. PDTC exhibited strong inhibitory activity on ICP0 and ICP4 expression in HSV-1-infected cells 24 h postinfection (p.i.) PDTC effects on HSV-1 ICP0 and ICP4 expression at different time point were determined via Western blot assay. ICP0 and ICP4 expression levels were quantified via real-time PCR. PDTC interfered with nuclear-cytoplasmic translocation of ICP0. HEC-1-A cells were infected with HSV-1 (MOI = 1) for 2 h. all experiments were performed 2 to 3 times, and a representative result is shown. PDTC completely attenuated ROS production in HSV-2-infected cells. PDTC inhibited HSV-2 replication neither through its antioxidant activity nor by blocking the MAPK pathway. both cells showed no anti-HSV-2 activity. the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK play an important role in HSV-1 replication (43\u201345) PDTC did not inhibit HSV-2-induced AP-1 activation, as demonstrated by an AP-1 luciferase reporter plasmid. two positive controls, SB203580 (p38 inhibitor) and SP600125 (JNK inhibitor), completely inhibited the AP-1 activation. PDTC may inhibit HSV replication through dysregulation of the UPS and inhibition of NF-B activation. PDTC induced the accumulation of ubiquitinated p53. NF-B activation was determined using NF-B-luc reporter plasmid. PDTC disrupted HSV-2-induced p65 nuclear translocation. p65 translocation in uninfected or infected cells treated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or PDTC (50 g/ml) was determined by immunofluorescence staining 24 h p.i. inhibition of NF-B activation reduced HSV-1 replication (57, 58) PDTC was also found to interfere with HSV-2-induced p65 nuclear translocation (Fig. 6G) the increased intracellular Zn2+ concentration facilitated by PDTC might contribute to its inhibitory effect on 26S proteasome activity and antiviral activity. PDTC increased the intracellular Zn2+ level. cells were incubated with PDTC or 200 M Zn2+ for 30 min. the intracellular Zn2+ level was determined via FluoZin-3 AM labeling. PDTC stabilized nuclear localization of PML during HSV infection. IE proteins target and colocalize with PML-NBs for initial viral replication. PDTC-treated cells exhibited enlarged NB size and increased NB numbers. a dominant-negative (DN) mutant of a ubiquitin expression plasmid was used. the expression of DN-mutant ubiquitin inhibited the expression of both HSV-1 and HSV-2 gD in HeLa cells. further analysis showed that ubiquitin mutant expression also blocked HSV-1 ICP4 expression at the early stage of viral infection. NF-B activation was measured 24 h p.i. each panel shows the means and standard deviation from three independent experiments. the inhibitors of DUBs and UBE1 inhibited HSV-2 replication. PDTC inhibited HSV-2 replication in a dose-dependent manner. more than 90% of the cells were viable at 100 g/ml PDTC. PDTC treatment resulted in the reduction of both HSV-1 and HSV-2 gD expression in HEC-1-A cells. the PDTC molecule consists of a dithiocarbamate and a pyrrolidine moiety. the removal of PDTC partially restored gD expression within 3 h. PDTC's antiviral property was mediated by its dithiocarbamate moiety. HEC-1-A cells were exposed to PDTC (25 g/ml) prior to infection. after 3 h of incubation, PDTC was removed by washing and complete medium was supplied. the gD expression levels were determined 24 h p.i. via the In-Cell Western assay. EDTA-Ca, -Mg, -Zn, and -Cu abrogated PDTC inhibition of HSV-2 replication, while EDTA-Zn and -Cu did not. each TPEN concentration was in duplicate. each TPEN concentration was in duplicate. PDTC exhibited strong inhibitory activity on ICP0 and ICP4 expression in HSV-1-infected cells 24 h postinfection (p.i.) PDTC effects on HSV-1 ICP0 and ICP4 expression at different time point were determined via real-time PCR. localization was observed via immunofluorescence staining 12 h p.i. all experiments were performed 2 to 3 times. the effect of PDTC on HSV-1 IE gene expression at the early stage of the viral life cycle was also investigated. PDTC inhibited HSV-2 replication neither through its antioxidant activity nor by blocking the MAPK pathway. both NAC and APO showed no anti-HSV-2 activity. PDTC did not inhibit HSV-2-induced AP-1 activation. two positive controls, SB203580 (p38 inhibitor) and SP600125 (JNK inhibitor), completely inhibited the AP-1 activation. PDTC inhibited HSV replication through dysregulation of the UPS. PDTC induced the accumulation of ubiquitinated p53. p53 and its ubiquitinated forms were visualized using p53-specific antibody. PDTC inhibited HSV replication through dysregulation of the UPS. with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or PDTC (50 g/ml) was determined by immunofluorescence staining 24 h p.i.. all experiments were performed 2 or 3 times, and the results of a representative experiment are shown. PDTC interfered with HSV-2-induced p65 nuclear translocation. the increased intracellular Zn2+ concentration facilitated by PDTC might contribute to its inhibitory effect on 26S proteasome activity and antiviral activity. PDTC did not inhibit 26S proteasome activity in a cell-free system. ubiquitin conjugates, IB-, and gD showed antiviral activity. previous reports have shown that PDTC is a zinc ionophore. PDTC or free Zn2+ treatment increased the intracellular Zn2+ concentration after 30 min. PDTC-treated cells showed enlarged NB size and increased NB numbers. PDTC stabilized the PML-NB complexes localized to the nucleus. EDTA could reverse the PML-NB stabilization induced by PDTC. DN mutation of ubiquitin attenuated NF-B activation in HEC-1-A and HeLa cells whether the cells were infected or not. gD expression levels were determined 24 h p.i. and normalized to the -catenin level. levels of ubiquitin conjugates, IB-, and gD were determined 24 h p.i. both inhibitors also had dramatic effects in inhibiting the reduction of ubiquitin conjugates caused by HSV-2, blocked HSV-2-induced IB- degradation, and inhibited viral gD-2 expression. the presence of copper or zinc ions is essential for the anticoxsackievirus activity of PDTC (7, 33) DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS contains only 5 M Zn2+ and 0.5 M Cu2+. the competitive chelating experiments using EDTA-metal ions ruled out major roles of both Ca2+ and Mg2+ in PDTC's inhibition of HSV. we found that blocking these two pathways inhibited viral replication. further analysis showed that PDTC did not affect the phosphorylation of JNK1/2 and p38. downstream AP-1 activation was not downregulated in the presence of PDTC, although gD expression was reduced. PDTC treatment led to enlarged PML-NB complexes and increased NB numbers in HEC-1-A cells. PDTC inhibition of HSV-2-induced, proteasome-mediated PML-NB degradation suggested that PML stabilized by PDTC may repress HSV gene expression and replication. YR-41) inhibited HSV-2 replication through interfering with ubiquitin conjugation. proteasome-dependent IB- degradation induced by HSV-2 infection was disrupted. current study demonstrates that homeostasis of the ubiquitin cycle and a functional UPS are prerequisites for viral gene expression and HSV replication."}
