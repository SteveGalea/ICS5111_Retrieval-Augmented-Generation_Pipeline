{"summary": "primary care is relatively weak in the Republic of Korea. patients can freely choose their medical provider from among clinics, hospitals, and tertiary hospitals. up to 85% of patients chose tertiary hospitals over primary care institutions such as clinics, mostly based on the preferences of patients with chronic diseases such as hypertension. the effect was found to be partial. factors included gender, age, region, educational level, income, type of insurance, chronic diseases, patient motives in choosing a provider, and type of medical institution used to obtain health care for chronic diseases. 999 participants included in the analysis after excluding one missing data. the survey was conducted using an internet survey system from the research firm Research & Research, Inc., which has a certified quality management system. the variables included gender, age, region, educational level, income, type of insurance, chronic diseases, patient motives in choosing a provider. logistic regression analysis was performed using the factors obtained from the factor analysis as the independent variables and the type of medical institution as the dependent variable. a new factor was used in the analysis based on the average value of the existing factors. region, gender, age, educational level, income status, type of insurance, and chronic diseases were adjusted.

kind and patient-centered services, while those visiting tertiary hospitals expected a good reputation and structural factors. this study investigated the factors that influence the type of institutions based on patient motives in choosing a provider, which has not previously been sufficiently examined. the significance of this study lies in its use of a survey to identify functional differences between institutions, which have not been sufficiently understood in analyzing the current situation in Korea."}
