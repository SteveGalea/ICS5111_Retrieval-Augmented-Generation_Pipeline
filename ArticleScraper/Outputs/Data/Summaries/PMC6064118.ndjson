{"summary": "essential oils (EOs) can easily reach both the upper and lower parts of the respiratory tract via inhalation. the aim of the present study was the antibacterial evaluation of clove, cinnamon bark, eucalyptus, thyme, scots pine, peppermint, and citronella EOs against respiratory tract pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae. the eucalyptus and scots pine showed weak activity against the test bacteria in both test systems. the EO of thyme, clove and cinnamon bark may provide promising antibacterial activity against respiratory tract pathogens."}
