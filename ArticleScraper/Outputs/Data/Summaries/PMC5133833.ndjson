{"summary": "IFN- exerts its anticancer effects by inhibiting cell proliferation, promoting cell apoptosis, and/or suppressing oncogene expression. cervical cancer is the leading threat to women\u2019s health worldwide, but there is no cure to this disease at present. the three pathways stimulate the common effectors (caspases 3, 6, and 7) to ultimately execute cell apoptosis. in this study, heLa cells were used as a testing model for the treatment of IFN- on cervical cancer. cells were treated with increased doses (0, 10, and 100 ng/mL) of IFN-treated HeLa cells. each value is represented as mean SD from three independent experiments. annexin V+/PI cells were treated with IFN- for 48 h. a higher dose delivery of IFN- significantly increased the population of apoptotic cells. to further define the optimal dose of IFN-, cells were treated with six increasing doses of IFN- for 48 h. HeLa cells were first seeded onto a 12-well culture plate and treated with different doses of IFN-. after 48 h culture, the cells were harvested and subjected to annexin V/PI double staining. each value is represented as mean SD from three independent experiments. rial Apoptotic Pathway Is Activated by IFN- treatment Next, we asked whether or not IFN-mediated cell apoptosis is associated with the mitochondrial-mediated intrinsic pathway. cells were probed with anti-Bim, anti-Bcl-xL, anti-caspase 3, anti-cytochrome c, anti-PARP1 (poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1), and anti-cleaved-PARP1 whole-cell lysates (WCL) were prepared and probed with anti-Bim, anti-Bcl-xL, anti-caspase 3, anti-cleaved-caspase 3, anti-cytochrome c, anti-PARP1 (poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1). the reaction products were subjected to Western blot analysis. expression levels of cytochrome c in whole-cell lysates were markedly increased. the expression level of cytochrome c in mitochondria was significantly decreased as the delivered dose of IFN- increased. the data strongly indicates that IFN-mediated apoptosis is associated with the activation of the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway in his cells. IFN-mediated cell apoptosis in HeLa cells is also associated with ER stress-induced apoptosis. whole-cell lysates prepared from IFN-treated HeLa cells were probed with anti-caspase 10, anti-caspase 8, anti-caspase 3, and anti-cleaved-caspase 3 antibodies. caspase 4 small interfering RNA (siCasp 4) was constructed for knocking down the endogenous caspase 4 expressions in HeLa cells. a significant rescue of IFN-mediated apoptosis can be observed when a higher dose (100 ng/mL) of IFN- treatment was used. whole-cell lysates were collected at 48 h post-transfection and subjected to Western blot analysis. the reaction products were probed with anti-caspase 4 antibody. inhibiting caspase 4 by siCasp 4 weakens the caspase 3 cleavage, but does not block IFN-mediated activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. the addition of siCasp 4 did not rescue IFN-mediated Bcl-xL repression, nor did it inhibit cytochrome c. interferon (IFN-) inhibits the proliferation of human cervical cancer cell line, HeLa cells. we hypothesize that IFN- may also possess anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects on HeLa cells. the reaction products were measured at 490nm with a plate reader. each value is represented as mean SD from three independent experiments. the variable cell number for each dose was calculated against the standard curve. whole-cell lysates were prepared from these IFN--treated cells. they were probed with anti-caspase 3 and anti-cleaved-caspase 3 antibodies. we chose concentration 100 ng/mL as the optimal dose for IFN- treatment. cells were treated with six increasing doses of IFN- (0, 10, 50, 100, 150, and 200 ng/mL) each value is represented as mean SD from three independent experiments. the whole-cell lysates prepared from (C) were probed with anti-caspase 3 and anti-cleaved-caspase 3 antibodies. IFN--mediated cell apoptosis in HeLa cells is associated with the mitochondrial-mediated intrinsic pathway. whole-cell lysates (WCL) were prepared and probed with anti-cytochrome c, anti-cytochrome c, anti-PARP1 and anti-cleaved-caspase 3 antibodies. the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic lysates were probed with anti-cytochrome c, anti-VDAC1 and anti-mtHSP70 antibodies. the -actin gene expression is served as an internal control for cytosol. mtHSP70, a mitochondria matrix-specific protein, was included to monitor the quality of the mitochondrial isolation. activation of caspase 8, 10 and caspase 4 can turn on the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. human caspase 4 plays a major role in ER stress-mediated cell death. caspases 8/10 could be activated by combined effect of tumor necrosis factor. anti-caspase 8, anti-cleaved-caspase 3, and anti-cleaved-caspase 3 antibodies subjected to Western blot analysis. the whole-cell lysates prepared from IFN-treated HeLa cells were probed with anti-caspase 4 antibodies and analyzed by Western blot. caspase 4 small interfering RNA (siCasp 4) reduces IFN-mediated HeLa cell apoptosis. qRT-PCR was conducted to measure endogenous levels of caspase 4 mRNAs. the ER Stress-Induced Apoptotic Pathway and the Mitochondrial Apoptotic Pathway are independently induced by IFN-. each value is represented as mean SD from three independent experiments. results were considered to be significant if p 0.05 (*) or not significant (ns) if p > 0.05. the whole-cell lysates were transfected with either control siRNA or siCasp 4 in the presence or absence of 100 ng/mL IFN-mediated activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. after 48 h incubation, the whole-cell lysates were harvested, probed with anti-caspase 4, anti-Bcl-xL, anti-cytochrome c, anti-caspase 3, and anti-cleaved- in this study, we demonstrate that IFN- alone may possess anticancer capacity by inducing the apoptosis of cervical cancer cells via the intrinsic and ER-stress related apoptotic pathways. we first systematically address this issue by using IFN-treated HeLa cells as a study model. treatment fails to activate caspase 8 and 10 in HeLa cells. the IFN-induced apoptosis may involve both of the intrinsic and caspase 4-related ER stress-induced apoptotic pathways. how these pathways regulate IFN-induced apoptosis needs to be further explored. the peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Zhongshan Biotechnology. human tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) and cycloheximide (CHX) were from Sigma-Aldrich Corp (St. Louis, MO, USA) Flow Cytometric Analysis Cell apoptosis was detected by Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit (Biotool, Beijing, China) after 48 h treatment, the cells were harvested and washed with precooled 1 PBS (phosphate-buffered saline) the reaction mixture was incubated away from light for 15 min at room temperature. PCR reaction was performed at 95 \u00b0C for 5 s and 60 \u00b0C for 30 s. the temperature was increased by 0.2 \u00b0C per 10 s. the -actin gene expression served as an internal control for normalization. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) high glucose (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) plus 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 \u00b0C supplemented with 5% CO2.

(Shanghai, China) equal amounts of cells were seeded into a 12-well culture plate. after 24 or 48 h treatment with IFN-, a 10 L culture medium from each well was added into the reaction qRT-PCR was performed using iQ7 system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) the reverse transcription was conducted at 42 \u00b0C for 5 s and 60 \u00b0C for 30 s and repeated for 40 cycles. the reaction product was cubated away from light for 15 min at room temperature. another 150 L binding buffer was added into the mixture. Western Blot Analysis The IFN-treated HeLa cells and control cells were collected after 48 h incubation. the cell pellets were lysed with lysis buffer containing 1% NP-40, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 120 mM NaCl, plus proteinase inhibitors."}
