{"summary": "BHK-21 cells were propagated at 37oC in a humidified incubator with 5% CO 2 in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS). both growth media were supplemented with 1% antibiotic solution (containing penicillin and streptomycin). 95016/BR-PE/02 strain is a deNV-3 clinical sample isolated from an 11-year-old female patient during the DENV-3 epidemics in the state of Pernambuco, Brazil in 2002. a 2-kb fragment was amplified by PCR from pRS414 (ATCC) it contains necessary elements to allow replication (CEN6/ARS H1) and selection (TRP1) in yeast. the 5\u2019-end primer used on this PCR reaction included a T7 promoter recognition site and a multiple cloning site. the first fragment (F5) was amplified using primers DENV-3-3481-F and DENV-3-4570-R. the last fragment (F5) was amplified using primers DENV-3-6521-F and pSVJS01-R.

HMAF was raised against group B flaviviruses including YFV and the four DENV serotypes. cells were rinsed twice with PBS and incubated for 1 h at 37oC. cells were stained with a Hoechst 33258 solution (Sigma-Aldrich) RNA transcripts were electroporated into BHK-21 cells. total RNA isolation from mock-transfected cells was used as negative control. RT-PCR products were analysed on agarose gel electrophoresis. fixed cells were incubated for 1 h at 37oC with a HMAF diluted 1:100 in ligation buffer. cells were rinsed with wash buffer and incubated with a 1:500 dilution in ligation buffer. the pSVJS01 backbone is based on pBeloBAC11, a BAC vector. to create the new shuttle vector, a 2-kb fragment was amplified by PCR from pRS414 containing CEN6/ARS H1 and TRP1. a T7 promoter recognition site and a MCS were also engineered into this fragment. pSVJS01-IC-DENV-3 #3 - full-length PCR amplicons were in vitro synthesised. resulting RNA transcripts were electroporated into BHK-21 cells. pronounced signs of cytopathic effect were visible in BHK-21 cells. cells were infected with either wild-type dengue virus type 3 (WT-DENV-3) or transcript-derived IC-DENV-3 #3. cells were fixed and incubated with a polyclonal hyperimmune mouse ascitic fluid raised against group B flaviviruses. a sample of the supernatant of infected cells was collected daily. virus titres were determined by titration in mosquito C6/36 cells. no statistically significant difference was found between the viruses at different time points. plasmid pSVJS01-rDENV-3prME was engineered into pSVJS01-rDENV-3prME sequence to serve as a genetic marker. PCR amplification and digestion by restriction enzyme confirmed the successful deletion of the target structural protein coding region. full-length PCR product derived from pSVJS01-rDENV-3prME was in vitro transcribed and resulting DENV-3 replicon transcript was electroporated deNV-3 replicon was assembled into pSVJS01 vector by homologous recombination, creating pSVJS01-rDENV-3prME. unique Bam HI site was inserted into DENV-3 replicon sequence as a genetic marker. the single most reported hurdle in the establishment of these systems is an inherent instability of flavivirus genome in E. coli ( Pu et al. 2011 ). the successful construction and characterisation of a complete reverse genetics system for DENV-3 has been described. reverse genetics systems were established using low-copy plasmid or BAC vectors to lower plasmid copy number in E. coli and, as consequence, achieve stability of cloned genomes. pBSC vector carries a 2 m high copy number origin of replication. different approaches have been used for the construction of flavivirus replicons. different approaches have been used for the construction of flavivirus replicons."}
