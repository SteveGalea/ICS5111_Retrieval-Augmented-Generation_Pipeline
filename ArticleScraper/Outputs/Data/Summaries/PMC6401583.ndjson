{"summary": "clinical manifestations of the infection in adult cases are not severe and disease is not associated with high mortality rates. virology, epidemiology and pathogenesis of disease were extracted from CDC and WHO websites. the situation reached its peak in 2015 when a striking increase occurred in reports of Zika virus infections in Brazil (5). the outbreak then spread to other countries in South, Central, and North America. the infections were associated with a significant increase in the number of microcephaly and Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome cases in the infected regions. in the Flaviviridae family, all members have enveloped viruses with a single-stranded RNA genome of positive polarity (10). the genomes are 5\u2032 capped without a 3\u2032 poly (A) tail. a polyprotein is coded by the ORF then processed into three structural proteins (the envelope (E), the capsid (C) and the precursor of the membrane (prM) nanchangmycin, nanchangmycin and nanchangmycin can be targeted by antiviral agents. the other approaches include the inhibition of endosomal fusion using compounds that reduce the acidity of endolysosomal vesicles like chloroquine. only sporadic cases and serological evidence of Zika virus were reported in western and central Africa and south-east Asia. in 2007 zika Virus emerged as an important human pathogen. in 2014, autochthonous transmission of Zika virus infection occurred in Easter Island (Chile) from Feb until Jul (24) some of these countries are particularly vulnerable to emerging of Zika virus. mainly due to a large number of travelers to and from the Americas, dense urban populations, a documented large epidemic of dengue and the most favorable climatic conditions. in vitro studies on fibroblasts exposed to Zika virus have shown high infection rates in these cells 24 to 48 h after infection. up to 60% of DCs express viral antigens around 24 h after infection. different cell surface receptors have been proposed to mediate Zika virus. keratinocytes, fibroblasts and immature dendritic cells can be infected. nate immune responses are followed by adaptive immune events including the activation of T cells. Zika virus-infected DCs migrate to regional lymph nodes where they stimulate T cell proliferation, differentiation and cytokine production. it is not well known how the virus is transmitted to developing nervous system. antigen detection is a valuable assay to approved Zika virus infection in autopsy tissues. new assays for detection include NS3 protein identification by flow cytometry in whole blood (43), aptamer-based ELISA assay for targeting of Zika virus NS1 protein (44), NS1 protein based competitive ELISA (45), NS1 protein\u2013based rapid tests (46) have been developed. FDA has authorized the use of several molecular assays under an emergency use authorization (EUA) (60) all of them are based on RT-PCR (such as Triplex Real-Time RT-PCR, a multiplex assay for detection of Zika virus, Dengue virus, and Chikungunya virus, CDC, and realStar Zika virus RT-PCR. anti-Zika virus IgG antibody rises few days after IgM. there is no FDA approved a serological test for the virus. so far there is no serological test for the virus. national and international health authorities should observe the principle of veracity. in mosquito control, governments should keep the moral obligation of observing biosafety and protecting the ecosystems in the mind while trying to restrict the insect spread and reproduction. virology of the Zika virus is a new emerging mosquito-borne virus belonging to the Flaviviridae family of viruses (9) this family is comprised of 4 genera: Flavivirus, Hepacivirus, Pegivirus, and Pestivirus (10). many important human pathogens are included in this genus, for example, dengue, West Nile, Yellow fever, tick-borne encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis, Murray Valley encephalitis and St. Louis encepha a host-derived membrane contained two viral glycoproteins (14) similar replication strategies are employed by the members of Flaviviridae family despite significant differences in tissue tropism, transmission, and pathogenesis (10). investigations are underway to find safe and potent drugs and therapies. Zika virus N2B-NS3 protease and NS3 helicase are potential targets for antiviral drugs. despite many studies done on Zika antiviral treatments, no category A drug has been found safe to use in mothers and fetuses. an unusually significant increase of GBS was reported in El Salvador. an emergency committee was convened under the International Health Regulations (2005). no countries of the Eastern Mediterranean Region have reported importation of Zika virus disease or autochthonous transmission. areas and countries potentially at risk of Zika Africa Angola, Benin, Burkina-Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo (Congo-Brazzaville), C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo (Congo-Kinshasa), Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Liberia, Mali, Niger, Zika virus can infect several different cell types including skin keratinocytes, dermal fibroblasts and dendritic cells (DCs). studies on zika virus-infected fibroblasts have shown strong upregulation of interferon-beta transcripts 24 to 48 h after infection (9) a milder response has been reported for interferon-alpha. studies on zika virus-infected fibroblasts have revealed strong induction of RIG-I and MDA-5 transcripts. in adults, Zika virus might be an etiological factor for \"Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis\" (ADEM) (33), an immune-mediated disease of the CNS. the first isolation of Zika virus was performed by intracerebral mouse inoculation considered as the reference assay for arboviruses isolation (25, 36) RT-PCR is highly sensitive and specific and known as the \u201cgold standard\u201d for ZIKV diagnosis (55) several conventional and real-time assays targeting prM, E, NS1, NS3, NS4 and NS5 genes have been developed (50, 56\u201359) the fda has approved only one commercial assay e.g. Cobas Zika test (Roche) which is a qualitative nucleic acid test for screening Zika virus RNA in blood donors. a short period of viremia can negatively affect the Zika virus RNA detection (65) detection of anti-Zika virus antibodies can be performed by different serological tests including complement fixation, haemagglutination inhibition, immunofluorescence (IF) assay, ELISA and neutralization tests (13, 35). the government should prioritize paying the noticeable amount of money for preventive measures in order to control the Zika virus spread. this priority setting is usually the most difficult step while encountering such situations, especially is the absence of enough scientific evidence to measure the real burden of disease. mainly microcephaly, of neonates delivered by mothers with Zika virus infection in their first trimester of pregnancy (81), puts abortion at the center of moral concerns. the position of various schools of ethics regarding abortion has a range from strict prohibition to complete moral justification based on the moral status they consider for the fetus in each development stage. in the u.s., abortion laws are still different according to the social, political, religious and cultural context. utmost importance for controlling potential zika virus threats in different countries. plagiarism, informed consent, misconduct, data fabrication and/or falsification, double publication and/or submission, redundancy, etc."}
