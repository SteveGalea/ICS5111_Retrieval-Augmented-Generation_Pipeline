{"summary": "syncytial virus (RSV), a member of genus Pneumovirus, is most common cause of severe disease of the lower respiratory tract in infants and the elderly especially in developing countries. there are also reports claiming that RSV could lead to severe repeated infections such as recurrent wheezing, pneumonia, or asthma in later childhood. the incomplete immunity in response to natural RSV infections is responsible for repeated infections. a safe and stable vaccine with long lasting immunity is an urgent need for the public. a vaccine with complete protection is an urgent need for the public. cell-mediated immunity is important in the clearance of infected cells. however, cell-mediated immunity on its own is not sufficient to provide complete protection against pathogens. a highly immunogenic RSV F protein with conserved sequence would be a desirable DNA vaccine candidate for protection from repeated RSV infections. HBSS, fetal bovine serum (FBS), L-glutamine (100 mM), antibiotics, trypLETM, 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD), NucleofectorTM electroporation kit for Cos-7 cells, TaqMan master mix 2x, real time probe, primers, superscript II reverse transcriptase, and RNase later solution were all obtained from Life TechnologiesTM. sorption was carried out for 1 h at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. MEM with 2% FBS was added to the flask and infection was observed for an additional 3-4 days. AGTGATCC RSV F QPCR forward primer CGATTTTTATTGGATGCTGTACATTT RSV F QPCR probe TGCCATGACACAATGGCTCCT According to the sequences published by Mentel et al. [27] all sequences are given 5\u2032-3\u2032 direction. Cos-7 cells were transfected with the PF construct using the nucleofector II electroporation device (Lonza, Germany) the GFP labeled RSV F gene construct was used for immunofluorescence imaging and flow cytometry, while the RSV F gene construct was used in RT-PCR analysis. the cells were incubated for 3 days at 37\u00b0C to allow for protein expression in vitro. six-to-eight-week-old female BALB/c mice were immunized intramuscularly (i.m.) with PBS (300 L) and PF DNA (50 g/300 L in PBS) to each thigh muscle on days 1, 15, and 29. serum was collected via retro-orbital bleeding from all groups of mice on days 0, 14, 28, and 49. the ELISA plates were washed and the enzymatic reaction was developed. the enzymatic reaction was read at 450 nm using a Tecan ELISA reader. the same protocol was followed for the immunofluorescence microscopy analysis except for the secondary antibody, rabbit anti-goat IgG-FITC (1 : 2000 dilution). the cell nuclei were stained with antifade-DAPI, and merged images were taken using the FITC and DAPI channel in the immunofluorescence microscope. human epithelial type 2 (HEp-2) and monkey kidney (Vero and Cos-7) cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, manassas, VA, USA) the animals were housed under standard approved conditions with a cycle of 12 h of light and 12 h of darkness. the animals were provided daily with sterile food and water ad libitum. purified DNA pieces were ligated using the T4 DNA ligase enzyme. they were transformed into competent cells of Escherichia coli DH5. clones containing the RSV F gene in the phCMV1 vector named PF. phCMV1 Vector Containing GFP Gene was amplified by PCR. the gene was inserted into the phCMV1 vector following the same protocol and conditions as described above. the third vector, containing RSV F and GFP, was also cloned and named PFG. cos-7 cells were transfected with the PF construct using the nucleofector electroporation gene transfection. total RNA was isolated from harvested cells and 1 g of RNA was converted into cDNA using the superscript reverse transcriptase enzyme. each qPCR reaction was run in duplicate along with water as a negative control. serum was collected via retro-orbital bleeding from all groups of mice on days 0, 14, 28, and 49. serum was collected by injecting carbachol (0.25 g/mouse) intraperitoneally. serum and saliva samples were stored at 80\u00b0C until analysis. 1.5 103 HEp-2 cells were mixed with sera+RSV mixture in a 96-well plate. cells were washed with 1x PBS (pH 7.0) before fixing the cells by incubating in 80% acetone (v/v) at 4\u00b0C for 15 minutes. positive clones were verified by RE digestion (BamHI and NotI) and DNA sequencing. PF and PFG clones were used to transfect Cos-7 cells. PG clone showed a high level of GFP protein expression. qPCR analysis in cos-7 cells using RSV F specific primers. the transcription efficiencies of the PF and PFG clones were quantified by qPCR analysis in cos-7 cells. SV specific IgM antibody was detected only in serum samples (not in saliva) from RSV F immunized mice during all immunization periods. IgG2a isotype antibody response, specific for the Th1 immune response. 1 mediated response was significantly higher than the IgG1 and IgG2b at all immunizations. all ratios were constantly lower than 1 clearly demonstrating a Th1-biased response following either RSV infection or RSV F vaccination. IgG2a RSV PF DNA Day 14 0.168 0.679 0.911 0.850 Day 28 0.53 0.443 0.827 0.666 Day 49 0.392 0.236 0.767 0.819 3.4. serum antibodies from RSV F DNA immunized mice serum reduced the infectivity of RSV by 46% and 30% in 1 : 8 serum dilution and 1 : 16 serum dilution respectively. the number of RSV mixed with different dilutions reduced significantly. ELISA was used to detect RSV reduction. two sera pools from each group of mice were run in duplicate. the PF and PFG clones were used to transfect Cos-7 cells. three days after transfection, green fluorescence signals were analyzed. the PG clone showed a high level of GFP protein expression. qPCR data showed the transcription of RSV F gene in PF/PFG transfected Cos-7 cells. PF clones were expressing RSV F protein in vitro. mock transfected cells were significantly higher than mock transfected cells. mice on days 0, 14, 28, and 49 and IgG antibody responses were detected by ELISA. data is presented as an average of triplicates performed twice. error bars represent standard deviations. IgG isotypes were detected by ELISA from serum samples of BALB/c mice on day 49. data is presented as an average of triplicates performed twice. IgG isotypes were detected by ELISA from serum samples of mice. ELISA data for RSV neutralization was confirmed with an immunofluorescence assay. the same experiment was repeated under the same conditions. the intensity of the FITC signal of the PBS group was detected as strong as the positive control (without serum). ignificantly different (P 0.01) from PBS group; significantly different (P 0.01) from PBS and PF DNA groups. cellular immunity is needed to clear infection, whereas humoral immune response is required for protection from initial and subsequent RSV infections. the native form of the RSV F protein is very crucial in stimulating the protective immune response against RSV. however, the most desirable immunity against any kind of pathogen is a balanced Th1/Th2 response. DNA vaccination elicits the Th1 biased immune response due to its endogenous expression and presentation to the immune cells. the immune system and the production of neutralizing antibodies are very important for protection from reinfection, which confer long term immunity by recruiting memory B cells."}
