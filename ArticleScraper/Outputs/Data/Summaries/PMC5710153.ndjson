{"summary": "62,496 mice in 15,624 IVC in 19 housing rooms, including 8064 immunodeficient mice in 2016 IVC in 4 isolation rooms separate from housing for immunocompetent strains. the facility accommodates, at capacity, 62,496 mice in 15,624 IVC in 19 housing rooms, including 8064 immunodeficient mice in 2016. each rack held 126 IVC (that is, 63 cages per rack per side) each pair of racks was ventilated and exhausted by a separate AHU. 4 models of AHU (SlimLine, TouchSlim, Touchslim-Plus, and SmartFlow; Tecniplast) were assessed in a static\u2013open\u2019 setting. resistant Staphylococcus aureus and norovirus is tuberculocidal in 5 min. all mechanically washed racks, hand-sanitized connecting hoses and AHU were exposed to VHP in an otherwise empty, sealed, housing room. Biological indicators (Bioquell) detect VHP levels capable of a 6-log reduction in microorganismal growth from Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores sealed inside pouches. bioquell CI are visual indicator cards which immediately document the effectiveness of the VHP cycle at its completion. each CI card has a series of symbols that change from blue toward white when exposed to VHP. prefilters were in place, and the AHU set to a VHP cycle. a total of 28 IVC racks and 17 AHU were exposed to VHP. the safety of VHP decontamination was assessed by using a handheld monitor. s from soiled, washed, or VHP-exposed equipment surfaces were surveyed over a 7-mo period. feces from mice housed on the IVC racks were collected and assessed for PCR evidence of S. xylosus. real-time PCR analysis was performed by using standard primer and probe concentrations. a VHP level capable of a greater than 6-log reduction in bioburden in equipment exposed in either the static\u2013open compared with active\u2013closed setting. an unconditional exact test was used to determine the proportion of S. xylosus-positive PCR samples obtained from VHP-exposed equipment in either the static\u2013open compared with active\u2013closed setting. IVC racks and plenums were washed in a mechanized rack washer. hoses were hand-washed in peroxyacetic\u2013hydrogen peroxide solution (6 mL per gal.); hoses were hand-washed. accelerated hydrogen peroxide formulation used in healthcare facilities2 as broad-spectrum virucide, bactericide, tuberculocide, and fungicide surface cleaner. all mechanically washed IVC racks, hand-sanitized connecting hoses, and AHU were exposed to VHP in an otherwise empty, sealed, housing room. the mobile VHP generator (model Z2, Bioquell, Horsham, PA) converts 35% concentrate liquid H2O2 to VHP aeration begins when the air is drawn in through the base of the VHP generator unit and is blown from its top, converting VHP to water and oxygen and resulting in a rapid decline in VHP levels. bioquell CI are visual indicator cards which document the effectiveness of the VHP decontamination cycle at its completion. CI document the distribution of VHP levels within a room or inside assembled IVC and AHU equipment interiors. for static\u2013open VHP exposures, the electronic AHU was turned off, its hose connections left unsealed and its prefilters were in place. swabs were used to collect specimens from soiled, washed, or VHP-exposed equipment surfaces. 34 AHU and 61 IVC racks were surveyed over a 7-mo period. feces from mice housed on the IVC racks were collected and assessed. ylosus DNA for each PCR test was calculated by plotting the real-time crossing point values from the S. xylosus PCR assays on a standard curve of log-fold dilutions of a positive control containing a known copy number. a P value less than 0.05 was considered to define a statistically significant difference. VHP levels throughout the room varied from 2 to 13 ppm, with a mean of 2.0 0.2 ppm detected at the unsealed door's threshold. personnel entering when the handheld H2O2 monitor indicated a VHP level of less than 1 ppm inside the room. room volume was calculated and programmed via the (A) electronic console outside of the room which controlled the (B) VHP generator and aeration catalytic accelerator. vaporizer temperature (\u00b0C) 1 30.0 119.7 120.2 120.3 123.7 28.5 2 30.3 119.6 120.1 120.1 120.1 122.7 26.4 3 26.3 119.7 119.9 120.2 120.1 120.1 120.1 122.7 26.4 3 26.3 119.7 119.9 120.2 120.3 27.5 27.5 4 23.4 119.7 120.1 119.4 122.4 27.6 VHP concentration (ppmm) VHP exposure of washed equipment was assessed with equipment in a static\u2013open setting, with the AHU off, hose connections open and unsealed, and IVC racks unassembled. all 21 CI placed inside the sealed room documented that the achieved VHP levels were capable of inducing at least a 6-log reduction in microbial counts. however, only 1 of 26 indicators placed deep inside plenums or manifolds. olds near the capped end or inside an AHU prefilter chamber left closed detected sterilizing levels of VHP. only 5 of 22 CI (23%) recorded at least 6-log microbial reduction VHP levels. only 3 of 11 BI (27%) demonstrated growth inhibition of G. stearothermophilus spores. room VHP indicators 15/15 (100%) 5/5 (100%) Equipment VHP indicators (sealed)c 18/18 (100%) 3/4 (75%) a Indicators were placed inside the sealed and connected plenum, manifold, or AHU exhaust prefilter chamber. d P = 0.008 To determine whether S. xylosus is shed from the skin of healthy mice. 23 of 31 (94%) specimens obtained from soiled equipment were PCR-positive for S. xylosus. 6 of 25 (24%) samples were S. xylosus PCR-positive. 17 of 48 (35%) specimens were S. xylosus PCR-positive after static\u2013open VHP exposure. all 10 samples from soiled IVC components were PCR-positive for S. xylosus. 2 of 12 (17%) remained S. xylosus PCR-positive after active\u2013closed VHP exposure. proportion of CI that confirmed 6-log reduction in bioburden was significantly greater than that (that is, 5 of 22 [23%] after static\u2013open VHP exposure) VHP levels detected inside hoses that connected the AHU to either the IVC rack supply (green) or exhaust (red) plenum or to the ceiling thimble (blue) by day 2, approximately 18 to 20 h after VHP cycle completion, mean VHP levels were still modestly elevated. we pooled fecal specimens from 68 cages of immunodeficient mice. 7 of 10 pooled murine fecal specimens were PCR-positive for S. xylosus at a mean copy number of 5497 14,382. specimens became PCR-detectable (copy number, 8) on day 7 after active\u2013closed VHP exposure. mean PCR copy numbers of S.xylosus detected in the exhaust plenum following VHP active\u2013closed exposure and the return of murine inventory. 35% of specimens collected from equipment airway interiors remained S. xylosus PCR-positive after static\u2013open VHP exposure. this absence of reliable VHP sterilization of IVC and AHU airway interior surfaces was supported by PCR surveillance for S. xylosus. the proportion of S. xylosus PCR-positive specimens obtained in the active\u2013closed setting was significantly decreased compared with that from the static\u2013open configuration. we found that residual H2O2 off-gassing by the active\u2013closed VHP-exposed equipment delayed the return of mice to the decontaminated equipment until approximately 20 h later. we are extending these findings by testing the applicability of VHP decontaminating exposure in common procedural and imaging areas frequented by immunodeficient mouse strains. we are assessing the prevalence of a broad range of opportunistic agents in our murine facility."}
