{"summary": "lysosomal cysteine proteases, the cathepsins, classified as clan C1,1 were long believed to be responsible for the terminal protein degradation in the lysosomes. this view has changed since they are involved in a number of important cellular processes, such as antigen presentation,2 bone resorption,3 apoptosis4 and protein processing. 9-12 Cysteine cathepsins are single-gene products, but the protein products male reproductive tract cystatins 8 (CRES, cystatin-related epididymal spermatogenic protein), 9 (testatin), 11 and 12 (cystatin T), the bone marrow-derived cystatin-like molecule CLM (cystatin 13) and the secreted phosphoprotein ssp24 (cystatin 14) type III cystatins, the kininogens, are large multifunctional plasma proteins, containing three type II cyst stefins A and B exibit 54% sequence identity, both are a 98-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 11,175 Da and 11,006 Da respectively. 19 The first three-dimensional structure of a stefin was the crystal structure of the recombinant stefin B in complex with papain. stefin B is widely expressed in different cell types and tissues. it was found in the nucleus of proliferating cells and both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm of differentiated cells. stefin B regulates the activity of cathepsin L in the nucleus. stefin A blocks up-regulation of IL-8 and GM-CSF release from keratinocytes stimulated with the allergens. 44, 45 Loss-of-function mutations in the gene for stefin A has been identified as the underlying genetic cause of another skin disease, exfoliative ichthyosis. two missense mutations fail to associate with lysosome-associated function for stefin B. loss of this association contributes to molecular pathogenesis of EPM1. 57 Type II Cystatins Among the most abundant human cystatins in immune cells. cystatin C is a strong inhibitor of all papain-like proteases (clan C1) 61, 62 and asparaginyl endopeptidase/legumain (clan C13) 63. it could be seen as a major human extracellular cysteine protease inhibitor. inactive dimer 71 is inactive until it is reduced to its monomeric form. 72 It is glycosylated 68, 69 and mannose-6-phosphate modification of its N-linked saccharides is used for targeting to the endosomes and lysosomes. 72, 74 Inactive dimer to active monomer conversion is also achieved with proteolitic cleavage. the unique features of cystatin F suggest that this immune-cell specific inhibitor plays a role in immune response-related processes through inhibition of specific enzyme targets. it is likely that in DCs, cystatin F could regulate the activity of cathepsin L and thus controlling the processing of procathepsin X. alterations in NK cell effector function will ultimately aid in driving differentiation of a population of surviving healthy as well as transformed stem cells. regulation of cystatin F and consequently cathepsin C and granzymes by NK cell surface receptors could be the mechanism which conditions NK cells to undergo split anergy. 88 Cystatin E/M is a high-affinity inhibitor of cathepsins V, L 89 and asparaginyl endopeptidase/legumain, 63 with lower affinity it binds also cathepsin B. in vivo mouse models have revealed that cystatin E/M is a key molecule in a biochemical pathway that controls skin barrier formation. 96-98 studies on implication of other type II cystatins in immune system are not numerous. cystatins S, SN and SA were first isolated from human saliva. their role in controlling cysteine proteases derived from bacteria has been suggested. 99-102 These three proteins with similar sequence are distantly related to cystatin D. onavirus replication 112 and cystatins S, SA and SN can suppress the infectivity of adenovirus 113 and herpes simplex virus 1. 114 Human genom contains several related genes encoding gycoproteins. the shared characteristic of three subgroup members is an expression pattern limited primarily to the male reproductive tract. cystatin C is a suitable marker for glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and kidney function. it has a possible application as a replacement for creatinine for detecting impaired GFR. 86 studies have shown decreased mRNA and protein expression levels of cystatin E/M and cathepsin V in the inflamed skin during atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. it is not clear whether changes in cystatin F levels result from or cause arrested remyelination. activity against cathepsins B, H, L and potent inhibition of cysteine proteases from parasitic organisms cleary indicate that salivary cystatins help to control the oral microorganisms rather than prevent periodotal diseases. type I cystatins, stefins A and B are up-regulated in tumor tissue and up to a certain level could counter-balance the over-expressed tumor-associated proteolytic activity. stefin B (I) and cystatin C (II) in va of patients with colorectal cancer (n=345) higher levels correlated with shorter survival. 159 animals with excluded expression of type I or type II cystatins experience better outcome with regard to tumor growth and metastasis. cystatin E/M was initially identified as a downregulated mRNA in metastatic breast tumor cells compared to normal and primary breast tumor cells 82. it is likely that the loss of the expression of cystatin E/M is associated with the progression of a primary tumor to a metastatic phenotype. scid mice implanted with cystatin E/M-expressing MDA-MB-435S breast cancer cells showed significantly delayed primary tumor growth compared to controls. 151, 152 Interestingly, down regulation of tumorogenesis through a similar mechanism has been shown also for a family-3 cystatin (AHSG) which inhibits colon carcinogenesis by suppressing TGF- signal transduction by blocking TGF-1 binding to cell surface receptors. cystatin E/M is a tumor suppressor factor important in breast and brain malignancy reducing tumor cell proliferation. 154, 157, 158 Collectively these data suggest that cystatin E/M could act as a tumor supressor through various mehanisms. they exert several immunomodulatory functions by controlling the activity of cysteine proteases or by other mechanisms not related to their inhibitory function. inhibition of cystatins could beneficially counteract tumor-associated proteolytic activity."}
