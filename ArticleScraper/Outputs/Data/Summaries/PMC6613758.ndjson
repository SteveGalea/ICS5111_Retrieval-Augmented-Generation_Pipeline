{"summary": "coronaviruses include important human and animal pathogens (1, 2). they have very large plus-strand RNA (+RNA) genomes of approximately 30 kb. they employ strategies of unusual complexity to express and replicate their genomes (3\u20135) the proposed role of ExoN in ensuring superior RNA replication fidelity has been supported by reverse genetic studies using a range of coronavirus exoN knockout mutants. the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) nsp8 has a second noncanonical RNA polymerase activity in vitro that catalyzes the production of short (6-nucleotide [nt] oligonucleotides in an Mn nsp8 based on the identification of slowly migrating 32P-labeled products generated in reactions in which the reaction mixtures were supplemented with nsp8 and metal ions (12). the last two studies did not use 3\u2032-blocked template-length RNAs to exclude the possibility that the radiolabeled template-length RNA products represented 3\u2032-extended forms. nsp8_K3711A mutant has RNA 3\u2032-terminal adenylyltransferase (TATase) activity if incubated with single-stranded and completely double-stranded substrates. this activity can be significantly stimulated by providing a short oligo(U) stretch as a template. we failed to obtain evidence for a canonical (i.e., high-fidelity and template-dependent) RNA poly expression strategy introduced by Gohara et al. was used (25). HCoV-229E nsp8 and the (mutant) nsp8_K3687A and nsp8_K3711 proteins could be purified in sufficient amounts for biochemical studies and proved to be stable upon storage at 20\u00b0. multiple-sequence alignment of the N-terminal regions of coronavirus nsp8 proteins representing the genera Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, and Deltacoronavirus. sequences were aligned using the Clustal Omega program (62) and converted using the ESPript program (63). numbers indicate positions in HCoV-229E polyprotein 1a/1ab sequence. preliminary experiments using HCoV-229E nsp8 revealed the production of radiolabeled products when the protein was incubated with synthetic oligoribonucleotide substrates in presence of [-32P]ATP. the protein was incubated at 30\u00b0C for 60 min under various conditions with respect to the (i) nsp8 concentration, (ii) NaCl concentration, (iii) identities and concentrations of metal ions, (i nsp8 activity required presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+ ions. high concentrations of these ions inhibited activity, while other metal ions failed to support nsp8 activity. nsp8 activity was sensitive to salt concentrations above 50 mM. activity assays were performed in reaction buffer supplemented with 2 M nsp8, 50 mM NaCl, 100 M ATP, 0.17 M [-32P]ATP, and 1 M U18 (substrate RNA), and the indicated divalent metal ions. 5\u2032-32P-labeled RNAs of U18 and KR07 were used as 18-nt and 28-nt markers, respectively, as indicated to the left. HCoV-229E nsp8 nsp8 lacked a free 3\u2032-hydroxyl group as controls. radiolabeled AMP was efficiently incorporated into products by HCoV-229E nsp8. no radiolabeled products were generated from 3\u2032-biotinylated substrate RNAs. nsp8-mediated RNA 3\u2032 polyadenylation reaction requires presence of a ribose-2'-hydroxyl group. oligoribonucleotides KR07, KR07-b, KR12, KR12-b, KR05, and KR13 were used as substrate RNAs. the nucleotide sequence of one of the substrates corresponded to that of the 3\u2032 end of the HCoV-229E genome (KR07). compared to the TATase activity obtained with KR07, nucleotide replacements of the 3\u2032-terminal cytidylate resulted in increased TATase activities. 5\u2032-32P-labeled RNAs loaded in lanes M were used as markers. sizes (in nucleotides) are indicated to the left. reactions performed with RNA KR07 and JZR3 in the absence of nsp8. HCoV-229E nsp8 was revealed to produce multiple radioactively labeled products of 40 nt. similar products were obtained in the presence of 50 M ATP, 50 M GTP, and 0.17 M [-32P]ATP. nsp8 is unable to incorporate GMP into reaction products. nsp8 TATase activity prefers blunt over recessive 3\u2032 ends in partially double-stranded RNAs. nsp8 activity assays were performed using a primer/template substrate (KR01/JTR1-b) and a derivative of this substrate in which the bottom strand was 3\u2032 biotinylated (KR01/JTR1-b). gCl2, 50 M ATP and/or GTP, 0.17 M [-32P]ATP (*ATP), or [-32P]GTP (*GTP), as indicated, and 1 M the indicated RNA substrate. the reaction mixtures were incubated at 30\u00b0C for 60 min. HCoV-229E nsp8 has oligo(U)-assisted TATase activity. we failed to obtain evidence for generic RNA template-dependent RNA polymerase activities. a number of preliminary experiments indicated that the 3\u2032-adenylation activity of nsp8 on double-stranded RNA may be affected by the presence or absence of specific 5\u2032 single-stranded regions. nsp8 failed to detect TATase activity for dsRNA substrates containing 5\u2032 A10 and C10 overhang regions (KR07/A10KR07comp-b and KR07/C10KR07comp-b), respectively. nsp8 used a short (5-nt) oligo(U) stretch in the opposite strand, suggesting that nsp8 uses the oligo(U) stretch (or a part of it a mixed (UC)10 sequence and (ii) a homooligomeric U20 sequence were detected. if the KR01 3\u2032 end was blocked with biotin, no radiolabeled product was generated. there was no detectable activity using a substrate containing a mixed (CU)10 sequence in the 5\u2032 single-stranded region. the products were resolved in a 12% polyacrylamide\u20137 M urea gel. in lane M, 5\u2032-32P-labeled ribooligonucleotides were loaded as markers. recombinant forms of SARS-CoV and FIPV nsp8 were produced in E. coli. coronavirus nsp8 proteins were incubated at 30\u00b0C for 60 min. the reaction mixtures were resolved in a 12% polyacrylamide\u20137 M urea gel. oligonucleotides were loaded as markers (lane M) mutant proteins were determined using the reaction conditions for the wild-type enzyme. no TATase activity was detected for the nsp8_K3711A protein. nsp8_K3687A retained its TATase activity on the two RNA substrates used in this experiment. mutant and wild-type HCoV-229E nsp8 proteins were incubated at 33\u00b0C. mutant nsp8 was readily recovered with titers of >106 PFU/ml. no viable viruses could be rescued after transfection of mutant RNAs. the HCoV-229E nsp8-coding sequence was inserted into a pASK3-derived plasmid downstream of a tetracycline-inducible promoter. coexpression of Ub-nsp8-CHis6 and Ubp1 resulted in proteolytic cleavage at the LRGGSVAS... site between the Ub moiety and the nsp8 sequence. multiple-sequence alignment of the N-terminal regions of coronavirus nsp8 proteins representing the genera Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, and Deltacoronavirus. arrows indicate positions in HCoV-229E polyprotein 1a/1ab sequence. preliminary experiments using HCoV-229E nsp8 revealed the production of radiolabeled products when the protein was incubated with synthetic oligoribonucleotide substrates in presence of [-32P]ATP. to optimize reaction conditions for subsequent studies, we used the following optimized reaction buffer in subsequent experiments. s-Cl, pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 4.5% glycerol, 1 M substrate RNA, 100 M the indicated nucleoside triphosphate(s) [NTP(s)], 0.17 M the indicated [-32P]NTP(s) (3,000 Ci/mmol), and 2 M ns activity assays were performed in reaction buffer supplemented with 2 M nsp8, 50 mM NaCl, 100 M ATP, 0.17 M [-32P]ATP, and 1 M U18 or KR07 RNA. 5\u2032-32P-labeled RNAs of U18 and KR07 were used as markers with sizes (in nucleotides) indicated to the left. HCoV-229E nsp8 lacked a free 3\u2032-hydroxyl group as controls. radiolabeled AMP was efficiently incorporated into products by HCoV-229E nsp8. no radiolabeled products were generated from 3\u2032-biotinylated substrate RNAs. nsp8-mediated RNA 3\u2032 polyadenylation reaction requires the presence of a ribose-2'-hydroxyl group. nsp8-mediated RNA 3\u2032 polyadenylation reaction requires the presence of a ribose-2'-hydroxyl group. nucleotides affect HCoV-229E nsp8 TATase activity. nucleotide sequence corresponded to that of the 3\u2032 end of the HCoV-229E genome (KR07) nucleotide replacements of the 3\u2032 cytidylate with adenylate, uridylate, and guanylate resulted in superior activities. 5\u2032-32P-labeled RNAs loaded in lanes M were used as markers. sizes (in nucleotides) are indicated to the left. reactions performed with RNA KR07 and JZR3 in the absence of nsp8. HCoV-229E nsp8 was revealed to produce multiple radioactively labeled products of 40 nt. similar products were obtained in the presence of 50 M ATP, 50 M GTP, and 0.17 M [-32P]ATP. no radiolabeled products were detected if the reaction was performed in the presence of 50 M ATP, 50 M GTP, and 0.17 M [-32P]ATP. radiolabeled products of the nsp8 activity do not represent 3\u2032-extended primers resulting from an ATP- and GTP-dependent copy process. instead, they represent 3\u2032 mono-, oligo-, and polyadenylated variants of the bottom strand of the partially double-stranded RNA hybrid used in the respective experiment. the reaction mixtures were incubated at 30\u00b0C for 60 min. products were resolved in a 12% polyacrylamide\u20137 M urea gel. sizes (in nucleotides) of 5\u2032-32P-labeled marker RNAs are indicated to the left. '-32P-labeled oligoribonucleotides were loaded as markers. sizes (in nucleotides) are indicated. a number of preliminary experiments indicated that the 3\u2032-adenylation activity of nsp8 on double-stranded RNA may be affected by the presence or absence of specific 5\u2032 single-stranded regions. 3\u2032-biotinylated forms of single- or double-stranded RNA substrates were not polyadenylated by nsp8. maximum 3\u2032 polyadenylation of the top strand was observed for an RNA hybrid in which the bottom strand had an unpaired 5\u2032 U10 overhang. nsp8 failed to detect TATase activity for dsRNA substrates containing 5\u2032 A10 and C10 overhang regions. if the KR01 3\u2032 end was blocked with biotin, no radiolabeled product was generated. there was no detectable activity using a substrate containing a mixed (CU)10 sequence in the 5\u2032 single-stranded region of the bottom strand. there was very efficient TATase activity for an RNA hybrid containing an unpaired 5\u2032 U20 sequence in the bottom strand. ribooligonucleotides were loaded as markers in lane M. we tested if SARS-CoV nsp8 and FIPV nsp8 display the same poly(U) template-assisted TATase activity described above for the HCoV-229E homolog. recombinant forms of SARS-CoV and FIPV nsp8 were produced in E. coli. activity assays were performed in standard reaction buffer with the indicated recombinant proteins in the presence of 100 M ATP and 0.17 M [-32P]ATP. the reactions were resolved in a 12% polyacrylamide\u20137 M urea gel and visualized by phosphorimaging. 5\u2032-32P-labeled oligonucleotides were loaded as markers (lane M) no TATase activity was detected for the nsp8_K3711A protein. nsp8_K3687A retained its TATase activity on the two RNA substrates used in this experiment. nsp8_K3687A bound RNA less efficiently than the wild-type protein. a final set of experiments examined the possible effects of the pp1a/pp1ab K3687A and K3711A substitutions in the context of viral replication in cell culture. full-length HCoV-229E genome RNAs containing desired mutations were generated using the reverse genetics system developed by Thiel et al. the protein was shown to be an essential cofactor (together with nsp7) for RdRp activity in vitro. additional functions were suggested to include (i) a function as a processivity factor for the viral RdRp (in a hexadecameric complex with nsp7). HCoV-229E nsp8 transfers (ribo)nucleotides to the 3\u2032 end of substrate RNAs. this activity was not detectable if substrates in which the 3\u2032-hydroxyl group was blocked were used. this essentially excludes the possibility that template-dependent de novo polymerase activities are involved in the production of radiolabeled products. a weak 3\u2032 extension of single-stranded substrate RNAs was observed. the nucleotide selectivity of the nsp8-mediated terminal transferase activity resembles that of eukaryotic poly(A) polymerases (PAPs), which are known to be highly specific for ATP. nsp8-associated RNA 3\u2032 nucleotidyl terminal transferase activity displayed a strong preference for ATP (over CTP and UTP) metal ions were shown to affect nucleotide selectivity of poliovirus 3Dpol in vitro (33), but not in the presence of Mg2+ ions. nsp8-mediated TATase activity was no longer observed in a more recent study using Mg2+ ions as a metal ion cofactor in RdRp assays including nsp8 (14). it has been confirmed for bovine coronavirus (BCoV) that viral plus-strand RNAs are 3\u2032 polyadenylated, while the 5\u2032 ends of negative strands contain a poly(U) track of 9 to 26 nsp8 TATase activity was increased if the 3\u2032-terminal nucleotides were replaced with purine (A or G) in the presence of a 3\u2032-terminal guanylate, the nsp8 TATase activity was enhanced, suggesting that purines are preferred over pyrimidines at the 3\u2032-terminal position. the effects observed for 3\u2032-terminal nucleotide substitutions support the idea that a differential base-stacking interaction may have a role in the initiation of 3\u2032 polyadenylation. in line with this interpretation, we found that replacements of the penultimate nucleotide had no detectable effect on nsp8 TATase activity. in line with this interpretation, we found that replacements of the penultimate nucleotide had a series of partial-duplex RNAs with one strand representing the 3\u2032 end of the HCoV-229E genome and the other representing the complementary 5\u2032 end of the viral antigenome (with and without 5\u2032 single-stranded tails) were used in activity assays. the results were obtained in reactions in which the reaction mixtures included appropriate complementary nucleotides (UTP and GTP) recessive 3\u2032 ends in partially double-stranded RNAs are clearly disfavored unless the bottom strand contains a stretch of uridylates. nsp8-mediated TATase acts to 3\u2032 polyadenylate genomic RNA and subgenomic mRNAs in an oligo(U)-assisted manner. coronavirus plus-strand RNA tails depend on specific polyadenylation signals. the factors and mechanisms that drive and regulate 3\u2032 poly(A) tailing of coronavirus plus-strand RNAs are currently unclear and deserve further investigation. oV-229E nsp8_K3687A was probably sufficient to retain TATase activity, while the SARS-CoV equivalent retained some of its capacity to support the polymerase activity of the nsp7-nsp8-nsp12 complex (14). replacement of another highly conserved lysine residue in nsp8, HCoV-229E pp1a Lys-3711, with Ala resulted in a > coronavirus nsp8 proteins act as nucleotidyl transferases. however, it does not support previous suggestions on nsp8-associated primase and RdRp activities. nsp8 is critically involved in coronavirus replication and acts as a cofactor for nsp12-mediated RdRp activity in vitro. the coding sequence of HCoV-229E pp1a residues 3630 to 3824 was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) from viral RNA isolated from HCoV-229E-infected Huh-7 cells. the resulting plasmid encoded the full-length HCoV-229E nsp8 fused to an N-terminal ubiquitin tag and a short C-terminal sequence, GSSGHHHH mutagenesis of plasmid constructs was done using a PCR-based approach. the primers used for cloning and mutagenesis are available upon request. the supernatant was incubated with preequilibrated agarose beads (Macherey-Nagel) for 2 h at 4\u00b0C under gentle agitation. the suspension was then loaded onto a disposable filter column. the protein was eluted with NP9a buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 250 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, 15 mM -mercaptoethanol) the reactions were terminated by the addition of sodium acetate and 10 volumes of ice-cold ethanol. the reaction mixtures were incubated for 60 min at 30\u00b0C. the reaction mixtures were incubated for 60 min at 30\u00b0C. s were stopped by adding Fu-mix (6 M urea, 80% deionized formamide, 1 TBE [Tris-borate-EDTA], 0.1% [wt/vol] bromophenol blue, 0.1% [wt/vol] xylene cyanol) reaction products were separated in 1 TBE-buffered 12% polyacrylamide gels containing 7 M urea. a reaction was performed in the absence of nsp8. RNA hybrids (10 M) were prepared by annealing two RNA oligonucleotides with complementary sequences in STE buffer in a final volume of 100 l. the mixture was incubated at 95\u00b0C for 5 min and slowly cooled to room temperature. plasmid pASK3-Ub-nsp8-CHis encoded full-length HCoV-229E nsp8 fused to an N-terminal ubiquitin tag and a short C-terminal sequence, GSSGHHHHHH. the resulting plasmid encoded the full-length HCoV-229E nsp8 fused to an N-terminal ubiquitin tag and a short C-termin nsp8 cells were inoculated with an overnight culture of TB1 cells. the cells were harvested by centrifugation (3,000 g for 10 min) and resuspended in ice-cold buffer. eluate fractions from the Ni-NTA chromatography were diluted 10-fold with buffer A (20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 5% [vol/vol] glycerol, 10 mM -mercaptoethanol) the protein was eluted with NP9a buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, 15 mM -mercapto coronavirus nsp8 was incubated with single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and partial-duplex substrate RNAs. reaction mixtures contained 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM DTT, 1.5 mM -mercaptoethanol, 4.5% g reaction products were separated in 1 TBE-buffered 12% polyacrylamide gels containing 7 M urea and analyzed by phosphorimaging using a Typhoon 9200 imager. first, 5\u2032-32P-labeled RNAs (600 nM) were denatured in STE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 7.5 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl, 1 mM EDTA RNA hybrids (10 M) were prepared by annealing two RNA oligonucleotides with complementary sequences in STE buffer in a final volume of 100 l. the mixture was incubated at 95\u00b0C for 5 min and slowly cooled to room temperature."}
