{"summary": "mice were infected with toxoplasma gondii at a time in human years equivalent to early to mid adulthood and studied 5\u201312 months later. mice had behavioral and neurological deficits, and brain MRIs showed moderate ventricular dilatation. perivascular inflammation is prominent particularly contiguous to the aqueduct of Sylvius and hippocampus. perivascular inflammation is prominent particularly contiguous to the aqueduct of Sylvius and hippocampus. even resistant mice have perivascular inflammation. some studies of prolonged T. gondii infection in conventionally housed mice simply report general neurological and behavioral abnormalities. others suggest there is a specific survival benefit to T. gondii, by producing effects such as lack of fear and inability to smell cat urine [9-16]. Earlier investigations of behavioral and neurologic findings have not maintained and documented a specific pathogen free status of the mice or rats studied. studies documenting that T. gondii modulates a variety of functions in cultured human host cells (e.g., monocytes, fibroblasts, and retinal cells). effects of chronic T. gondii infection on transcriptomes and proteomes of brain or individual neuronal cells have not been reported. mice and T. gondii infection of mice for behavioral and neurologic assessments, MRIs, microarrays, and histopathology Swiss Webster mice were bred in our (RM) laboratory. the colony room was maintained at 22\u00b0C with a 12\u201312 hour light/dark cycle (lights on at 600 h CST) outbred mice used for electron microscopic studies were maintained in non-SPF conditions in Glasgow, Scotland. both controls and T. gondii infected mice were housed in identical conditions in the same colony. ulent Me49 strain were obtained from the brains of female Swiss Webster mice infected with T. gondii between 6 and 16 weeks earlier. the suspension was diluted in sterile saline and 100 cysts were administered i.p. into mice. a pilot experiment was performed with mice infected with T. gondii when they were 1.5 or 7 months of age. animals were assessed using a series of well-established ordinal scales [67,68] to categorize a broad array of health and behavioral features as well as indices of motor/neural function. physical appearance and autonomic characteristics Illness behavior and general appearance were assessed using the following scales. this was analyzed as absent = 0 or present = 1 or absent = 1. urination/defecation Thought to be a measure of autonomic nervous system tone, urination and/or defecation during brief periods of handling were recorded. Tremor Tremors were scored on the following scale (0) None; (2) Slight fine body tremor (1.5 mm); (4) Moderate coarse (3 mm) with slight impairment in locomotion; (6) Marked coarse (4.5 mm) with moderate marked impairment. Tremor was analyzed as present = 1 or absent = 0. Activity Mice were transferred from group housing to individual home housing boxes. open-field testing Mice were placed in a stainless steel field 40 cm 40 cm 40 cm, consisting of 4 sides joined to form a square. the only object present in the field was a stainless steel bowl into which the animal was gently placed at the beginning of testing. MRI T1 weighted and T2 weighted magnetic resonance imaging was performed on a 9.4 Tesla imaging system (Varian console) the images were acquired to highlight fluid using a multi-slice inversion recovery gradient echo sequence. image resolution was 110 110 microns in plane and 800 microns through plane. the aqueous phase was transferred to a fresh tube and RNA was precipitated with.5 ml of isopropanol per sample. the gel like pellet of RNA was washed with 1 ml of 75% ethanol per sample. the sample was resuspended in RNA free water and quantitated using a spectrophotometer. the MEEBO array is an open source collection of probes designed to yield information on 25,000 mouse genes. the collection includes probes for 25,000 constitutive exons, 4,000 alternately spliced exons, and > 5,000 mRNAs. further information can be found at the web-links in the references section. the posterior log-odds, B, that a gene is differentially expressed was calculated and used to rank the genes. the practice of excluding (filtering) poor quality spots reduces power and efficiency. inflammation with cysts was scored as the number of cysts adjacent to inflammatory lesion. other cysts were in apparently normal brain. there was no necrosis in any of the brains. brain tissue from 5 control and 5 infected mice were compared. sections were double labeled with rabbit anti-SAG1 and mouse anti-BAG1 (bradyzoite specific) and visualized using anti-rabbit-Ig conjugate to fluorescein isothiocyanate. additional sections were stained with anti-SAG1 and antibody CC2 (stains tissue cyst wall) LC on tandem Superose 6 columns and the cholesterol in the fractions analyzed using a kit from Roche Molecular Diagnostics. mice without these cytokines or innate immune responses, i.e., IL4, IL6, IL13, or Nramp knockout mice, in separate studies were infected, maintained and studied as described previously. in these experiments, infection was with clonal type II Beverly strain of T. gondii. hamster polyclonal antibody to PD-L1 or hamster isotype-control was administered as described [86] and as had been shown in earlier studies to ablate PD-L1 function in mice. cognitive/behavioral assessments were summarized as mean SD unless otherwise noted. the pathological findings in the four areas of the brain were considered after summing across types of findings. descriptions of mice and T. gondii infection of mice for behavioral and neurologic assessments, MRIs, microarrays, and histopathology Swiss Webster mice were derived from breeding pairs originally obtained from Harlan Laboratories. mice used for electron microscopic studies were maintained in non-SPF conditions in Glasgow, Scotland. both controls and T. gondii infected mice were housed in identical conditions in the same colony. the colony room was maintained at 22\u00b0C with a 12\u201312 hour light/dark cycle (lights on at 600 h CST) all animals were handled at least once/week for 10\u201315 seconds. tests for the pathogens listed below were negative. outbred mice used for electron microscopic studies were maintained in non-SPF conditions in Glasgow, Scotland (DF). both controls and T. gondii infected mice were housed in identical conditions in the same colony at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. a subset of behavioral and neurologic measures were studied in the pilot and initial cohorts. the two replicate cohorts each included 5 control mice and 5 mice infected at 7 months of age. a subset of assessments were conducted monthly from 3 to 5 months post infection. physical appearance and autonomic characteristics were assessed using the following scales: Hunching Healthy rodents often show characteristic hunched posture, ruffled fur and a reluctance to move. Piloerection Piloerection is a measure of autonomic instability and a sign of distress. body weight Animals were weighed, often a sufficient measure of general health, at the outset of the experiment and when behavioral testing was complete. Tremor Tremors were scored on the following scale (0) None; (2) Slight fine body tremor (1.5 mm); (3) Moderate coarse (3 mm) with slight impairment in locomotion; (6) Marked coarse (4.5 mm) with moderate marked impairment. d dulled; (2) Moderately dull; (3) Sub-alert; (4) Alert, active; (5) Hyperalert; (6) Slightly excited; (7) Moderately excited (\"hypomania\"); (8) Extremely Excited (hypermanic), 'hypermanic' urination/defecation Thought to be a measure of autonomic nervous system tone, urination and/or defecation during brief periods of handling were recorded. observations of vertical posture were made and body position was recorded as a still photograph of each animal. activity Mice were transferred from group housing to individual home housing boxes. animals were assessed using a series of well-established ordinal scales to categorize a broad array of health and behavioral features. this was scored as (0) normal gait and exploratory pattern. open field study was a five minute timed exposure to the open field. in-room observers recorded latency (sec) to move from the animal's initial position, and the number of sniffs, rears, freezes and visits to the center. the upside down lid was held approximately 20 cm above soft padding. the mouse could not climb down but was safe in the event of a fall. investigators used a stopwatch to measure latency to fall off the wire lid. msec. Image resolution was 110 110 microns in plane and 800 microns through plane. 16 slices spanning from rhinal fissure to cerebellum were imaged at 1 year of age. five of the infected mice had been infected for 8 months. sample washed with 1 ml of 75% ethanol per sample. sample was re-centrifuged at 7500 g for 5 minutes at 4 degrees C. extinction coefficient aliquots of 40 g (260/280 was less than 1.6) used for hybridization experiments. a single parametric model represents the microarray data generation process, including sources of noise. the alignment of grids was checked prior to spot finding, but no manual intervention or flagging was performed. the data from BlueFuse were analyzed using R Version 2.2.0 for Windows [77], limmaGUI Version 1.4.0 [78] and limma Version 2.3.3 [79] MA plots and M box plots, generated with limmaGUI, showed that normalization was required. the percentage of spots in the top N ranked genes common to both subsets was calculated for all values of N and plotted against N. all the spots corresponding to genes were included in the analysis but were weighted by the square root of the blueFuse confidence measure. the tissue sections were incubated with anti-mouse CD4 (1 g/ml, GK1.5), CD8 (4 um/ml, Cat#553027 from PharMingen), CD11b (2\u201320 g/ml MAB1458 from Chemicon International) the anti-mouse IgG antibody was applied and incubated for 30 minutes. additional sections were stained with anti-SAG1 and antibody CC2 (stains tissue cyst wall) electron microscopy The images of these sections were prepared as described previously for the manuscript using non-SPF, SW mice that were chronically infected with T. gondii. brain tissue from 5 control and 5 infected mice were compared. sections were double labeled with rabbit anti-SAG1 and mouse anti-BAG1. additional sections were stained with anti-SAG1 and antibody CC2. mice without cytokines or innate immune responses in separate studies were infected, maintained and studied as described previously. infection was with the clonal type II Beverly strain of T. gondii. mice were either infected with Me49 or uninfected controls. treatment of mice with hamster polyclonal antibody to PD-L1 or hamster isotype-control This was administered as described [86] and as had been shown to ablate PD-L1 function in mice. the pathological findings in the four areas of the brain were considered after summing across types of findings. the results were observed in carefully monitored and characterized SPF mice chronically infected with T. gondii. - 50.6 Active - - 4 9 7 0 10 Control Good - - - - - 58.5 Active - - 1 2 9 0 1 Infected Poor + + + + - - 43.8 Slow + + + + - - - 41.2 Active + + + 0 0 0 180 Infected Very Poor + + + + + 35.3 None + + + nd nd nd nd nd Infected Good - + + + mouse uninfected and chronically infected with T. gondii. hunched body position, poor grooming, piloerection, reduced body mass, and tail wounding. chronically infected mice weighed less than uninfected mice at both 11 and 16 months after infection. the infected mice lost weight over time while the uninfected mice gained weight. a decrease in autonomic nervous system function of infected mice was also statistically significant when compared to uninfected mice. in each experiment, abnormalities in appearance were found in some of the infected mice as early as 3 months post infection. by 5 months after infection, four of the ten infected mice in the combined replicate studies had died, two had pronounced gait abnormalities involving their lower extremities. uninfected mice showed no abnormalities other than very slight lateral ventricular dilatation. similar MRI images of the brains of the infected mice showed no (n = 1), mild (n = 1) and moderate (n = 4) lateral ventricular dilatation. in 4 of 6 infected mice there is right-left brain asymmetry (I1, I3, I4, I5). ventricular dilatation and some asymmetry present in brain parenchyma of infected mice. all of the uninfected mice had a score of 0. mild incoordination of gait was scored a 1 or 2, moderate incoordination was scored 3\u20137 and severe disability in moving one or both hind legs was scored 8\u201310. there were no neurologic abnormalities and no association of body size with brain weight present in the 10 uninfected mice. there were no significantly downregulated genes. the microarray results are consistent with an inflammatory process involving immunoglobulin and B cells and interferon gamma production.

LB/c mice were infected with clonal type II Me49 parasites for 6 months. there were only very rare cysts but there was a small amount of perivascular accumulation of inflammatory cells in 4 of the 5 infected mice and leptomeningeal inflammation that was not seen in the controls. these results were similar to studies of brains of mice infected for 60 days. uninfected mice showed mild to moderate parenchymal inflammation, perivascular cuffing with inflammatory cells, and leptomeningeal inflammation with scattered cysts without inflammation. uninfected mice had no brain pathology (p = 0.02 for comparison to infected mice) bar is 1 m. inset: Similar area to that in D immunostained with an antibody to the cyst wall. bar is 10 m. inset: Similar area to that in D immunostained with an antibody to the cyst wall.

MRIs were performed for 6 chronically infected mice (8 months after infection [n = 5] or 12 months after infection in the case of the pilot [n = 1]) uninfected mice showed no abnormalities other than very slight lateral ventricular dilatation. MRIs from uninfected mice (U1-3), chronically infected mice (I1-5) and one infected mouse studied in a pilot experiment at a different time (P1). MRIs were obtained when mice were 1 year old and infected mice had been infected for 8 months. the mean sd [range] of brain weight for infected and control groups was 0.42 0.04 [.385\u2013.466] g and 0.46 0.03 [0.427\u20130.510] g respectively (p = 0.065) the infected mice that had more obvious gait abnormalities had the smallest brains. there were 326 significant probes (corresponding to 311 different genes) with an adjusted P-value less than 0.01 and a posterior log odds of differential gene expression greater than 2. there were no significantly downregulated genes. 118142, MGC6727, Igh-A (1g2), Vh186.2/Jh2) [J00475] Immunoglobulin joining chain (Igj, 9530090F24Rik, AI323815, Jch) [NM_152839] Antigen presentation MHC-I Similar to H-2 MHC-I antigen, D-37 alpha chain precursor (C920025E04Rik) [AK083387] MHC- major inhibitor of classical complement Serine (or cysteine) peptidase inhibitor, clade A, member 1 (Serping1, C1INH, C1nh) [NM_009776] Serine (or cysteine) peptidase inhibitor, clade A, member 3N (Serpina3n, Spi2-2, Spi2.2, Spi2/eb.4) GeneCards: although its physiological function is unclear, it can inhibit neutrophil ca geneCards: plays a pivotal role in regulating lineage-specific hematopoiesis by repressing ETS1-mediated transcription of erythroid-specific genes in myeloid cells. regulation of cytokine signaling by interleukin 6 (IL6) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) interferon gamma involved in degradation of cytoplasmic antigens for MHC class I antigen presentation pathways. proteosome (prosome, macropain) 28 subunit, alpha (Psme1, AW413925, MGC113815, PA28a) GeneCards: Implicated in immunoproteasome assembly.

Histopathology in brain regions of uninfected and infected mice. in the brain, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, plasmacytoid B cells, and activated microglial cells formed prominent perivascular infiltrates (cuffs around vessels of all sizes) in the brain, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, plasmacytoid B cells, and activated microglial cells formed prominent perivascular infiltrates (cuffs around vessels of all sizes) in chronically infected mice, the individual plasma cells around vessels were identified by the presence of the immunoglobulin within the cytoplasm (Figures 4E, F). in our chronically infected, SPF mice there were rare microglial nodules but no areas of necrosis as seen in immune-compromised persons [89], mice with the C57BL/6J genetic background [36], or various other murine models of immune-deficiencies. the presence of very few extracellular parasites contrasted with the robust immune response in the brain parenchyma, leptomeninges and around blood vessels. inflammation and parasite burden were greatest in diencephalon (mean SD), then cortex (5.6 3.2, 4.5, 2\u201312), and then hippocampus (4.9 2.4, 4.5, 3\u201310). co D H Ce p-value* PV Cuffing 1 2 2 1.5 0.12 1-1 1\u20133 1\u20133 0\u20132 Inflammation 1.5 1 1 1 0 0.37 0\u20134 0\u20134 0\u20134 0\u20134 0\u20131 Calcifications 0 0 0 2.5 0.02 0\u20134 0\u20132 0-0 0\u20134 Cysts 2.5 2 1.5 0 0.01 0\u20134 0\u20134 0\u20132 Abbreviations: Co = Cortex; D = Diencephalon; H = Hippocampus; Ce = Cerebellum Table 6. correlations of region of brain involved and behavioral and neurologic findings. ampal perivascular inflammation In the chronically infected mice there is an area of pronounced inflammation in the leptomeninges contiguous to the hippocampus. this was present in all of the eleven chronically infected mice that survived to the end of the studies in the second and the third replicate experiments. this was present in those that had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in which tissues were available and this was specifically examined. infected mice with the most abnormal gait had the most severe brain inflammation. a mouse with abnormalities of both legs had substantial inflammatory infiltrate in the corticospinal tract. sulfadiazine does not eliminate pathology. fadiazine treatment administered to chronically infected mice for 4 months did not significantly modify pole balance (16.4 12.9, range = 0\u201329 versus 23.6 23.8, range = 2\u201360; p = 0.68) or grip test results (10.8 5.4, range = 4\u20136 versus 8.0 1.0, range = 7\u20139; N = 5 mice per group, p 0.01). these values are for number of cysts in 50 microliters of half a brain, which was hamster antibody to PD-1L or isotype-control was administered every 7 days for 21 days. the ligand allows persistent Lymphochoriomeningitis virus brain infection by limiting activity of T cells. the median number of cysts were 13, 6, and 5 in the no antibody, isotype-control antibody, and PD-1L antibody groups. perivascular inflammation 40 for mouse that had mild lateral ventricular dilatation in MRI. genetically resistant BALB/c mice also have perivascular and leptomeningeal inflammation. these mice had prominent perivascular cuffing and parenchymal infiltrates. they also had prominent perivascular cuffing and parenchymal infiltrates. these cytokines and NRAMP were neither necessary nor sufficient to cause the pathology we observed. the brain was removed and fixed in formalin for subsequent histopathology. infected mice identifying the host cells (HC) as neurons due to the formation of synapses (arrows) the cysts appear to be within a neuronal dendrite. the cysts appear to be within a neuronal dendrite. the global sensorimotor loss is present in the months following infection, is progressive, and persists a year or more after infection. others with colonies of chronically infected mice, some conventionally housed and some SPF, also observed, but did not report similar findings. normal non-invasive, objective, imaging measures of brain parenchyma showed only and primarily ventricular enlargement, particularly along the aqueduct of Sylvius. it seemed remarkable to have profound, repeated, and consistent behavioral/neurological findings without an obvious inflammatory, necrotic or other pathologic changes. T. gondii microneme protein 2 (MIC2) binds to VCAM and is important in parasite attachment during invasion of cells. these findings suggest that T. gondii may secrete molecules with the capacity to epigenetically modify expression of genes important in neurodevelopment or death of infected neurons. ogenesis of the behavioral and neurologic findings was correlated with lower brain weight. there were no abnormal neurologic findings in uninfected controls. this loss of brain parenchyma is consistent with the dilated ventricles seen in the MRIs. mitogen-activated protein kinases mediate glia-induced neuron death. inflammatory mediators also modify clearance of misfolded proteins. perivascular inflammation is common to a number of neurodegenerative diseases. immunostaining for tachyzoites and bradyzoites and review of electronmicrographs provides insights into initiation of the inflammatory process. electronmicrographs made with brains from conventionally housed, chronically infected, outbred mice have been reported earlier [50,51,103,104]. in our outbred SPF mice chronically infected with T. gondii described under histopathology and transcriptome. immunostaining of brain tissue demonstrated that CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells, and microglia were present in similar areas of parenchymal inflammation. this inflammation occurred whereas brains from uninfected control mice had no inflammatory process. electronmicrographs suggest that bradyzoites are associated with inflammatory cells and clearly e neuronal damage may be associated with cytokines or chemokines from such cells that are known to elicit neurologic damage and loss as a bystander effect in other diseases. transcriptomes of brain from chronically infected SW mice compared with uninfected mice provide additional insights into molecular pathogenesis of behavioral and neurologic abnormalities and histopathology. the increase in PD-L1 (CD274) ligand, associated with \"exhausted\" T-cells in a chronic viral infection, may be a contributing factor. PD1L has recently been found to tolerize T cells in the brain in acute toxoplasmosis. mRNA for subunits of C1q is found in greater abundance compared to controls. previous studies have shown that complement component C1q is upregulated in a range of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease. the meningoencephalitis was present in chronically infected, genetically resistant, inbred SPF mice. the presence of the same pathology in mice without NRAMP, IL-4, IL-6, or IL-13 indicates that none of these genes or cytokines are necessary or sufficient to cause this histopathology. mice previously infected with T. gondii in young adulthood developed much more (and more severe) atheromatous disease. apo E deficient mice developed much more (and more severe) atheromatous disease. findings raise questions as to whether inflammation in brain caused by T. gondii infection could act as a co-factor in the development of neurodegenerative diseases. toxoplasmic encephalitis is more frequently but not exclusively reported in immune-compromised individuals. findings reflect large areas of necrosis due to unconstrained bradyzoite to tachyzoite switch. inflammation around blood vessels and in brain parenchyma has been described in outbred mice with some but not all isolates of T. gondii earlier [37] in schizophrenia there are epigenetic modifications of human DNA [49] that are reminiscent of the manner in which T. gondii modifies HERVS in a human neuronal cell line [48] there are calcifications in these same areas of brain, e.g., basal ganglia and periventricular areas, that mimic this congenital infection. the recent finding that Aicardi-Goutieres's syndrome is caused by mutations in a DNAase pathogenic mechanisms may include usurping or interfering with functions of neurons infected by T. gondii bradyzoites within large cysts. parasites within neurons could directly result in death of infected neurons or there could be death of contiguous bystander neurons. ected mice that acquired primary infection in early adulthood are progressive and persistent. chronic T. gondii infection of SPF SW mice alters their appearance, behavior and neurological function. abnormalities are clearly more prominent in the SPF SW mice than only alterations in fear, i.e. lack of fear when smelling cat urine. brain MRIs were performed with chronically infected mice for 8 months. neurologic abnormalities similar to those in the SW mice also were observed in the chronically infected mice. neurologic abnormalities were not quantitated systematically as was done for the SW mice. expression of the ABCA4 gene is localized to the periventricular/perihippocampal area (Figure 9). this area is noted to be prominently involved in the MRIs and histopathology of the chronically infected mice. this association has a parent of origin inheritance pattern. loss of brain parenchyma in the medial aspects of the temporal lobes is manifest by similar increases in lateral ventricular volume. neurologic and behavioral abnormalities correlate with lower brain weight and inflammation, especially in perihippocampal, hippocampal, and periventricular areas. microglial cells produce neurotoxic molecules, e.g., nitrous oxide, proinflammatory cytokines, and reactive oxygen species. inflammatory mediators also modify clearance of misfolded proteins. tachyzoites and bradyzoites have inflammatory lesions in the brains of the same mice studied for behavioral, neurologic, conventional, histopathology and microarrays where inflammatory processes were noted. immunostaining for tachyzoites and bradyzoites provides insights into initiation of the inflammatory process. s, T. gondii cysts occupied much of the cytoplasm of neuronal cells and the neurons formed synapses. no inflammatory process is noted around the perimeter of the individual cyst when the neuronal membrane was intact. inflammatory cells were not present around intact cysts or cysts that had ruptured. bradyzoites from cysts in neuronal cells in which host cell membrane is intact elicit no inflammatory response. neuronal damage may be associated with cytokines or chemokines from such cells that are known to elicit neurologic damage and loss. chemoattractants Ccl5 and Ccl8 promote monocyte and lymphocyte recruitment. heavy and light chain genes comprise two thirds of the list. increase in PD-L1 (CD274) ligand, associated with \"exhausted\" T-cells in a chronic viral infection, may be a contributing factor. expression of IFN inducible GTPases of both the p47 and p65 classes indicates an increase in antigen processing and presentation. IGTP has been shown to be important in limiting T. gondii growth in astrocytes. this induction is dependent upon STAT1 for expression [112]. the regulation of complement appears to be balanced as the slp increase suggests the need for immune complex clearance concomitant with a Serping1 increase, inhibiting complement activation via the classical pathway. neuronal signaling and brain development pathways recently identified as disrupted with rare structural variants in a genetic analysis of schizophrenia. the presence of the same pathology in mice without NRAMP, IL-4, IL-6, or IL-13 indicates that none of these genes or cytokines are necessary or sufficient to cause this histopathology. absence of inflammation outside the central nervous system suggests that behavioral abnormalities and neural lesions probably are not caused by a concomitant, peripheral, inflammatory process. rare extracellular bradyzoites share similarities to responses in neurodegenerative diseases in humans. toxoplasmic meningo-encephalitis and chronic T. gondii antibody production in cerebrospinal fluid of persons with chronic neurologic diseases without known immune-compromise have been reported rarely. there are many cases of encephalitis of unknown etiology but for the most part they have not been ascribed to chronic toxoplasmosis. the prominent hippocampal and hippocampal perivascular leptomineageal process in the mice we studied also is of interest because of the association of hippocampal abnormalities in neurodegenerative diseases, depression, and schizophrenia. the prominent involvement of the area around the aqueduct of Sylvius remains unexplained. the increased expression of PD-1 ligand and CD36 raises questions about whether T. gondii shares mechanisms to down-modulate critical protective immune functions that also allow latency in infections with certain viruses. parasites arrive at blood brain barrier in dendritic cells, travel into brain tissue and form bradyzoites in cysts. when the neuronal membrane is no longer intact, bradyzoites elicit an immune response as shown. this results in destruction of their growth and bystander cell death. Deficiency in IL4, IL13 and NRAMP are not sufficient to abrogate this inflammatory process. microarrays provide insight into the molecular pathogenesis of the processes in the outbred mice reflecting inflammation, attenuation of this inflammation by counter regulatory processes. authors declare that they have no competing interests. DF performed immunostaining for T. gondii tachyzoites and bradyzoites, cyst wall and plasma cells. FR, CW, DF, YS, and RM carried out all other microscopic analyses. TT and RM created the overview model for the manner in which the parasite and inflammatory process contributed to pathological process. lden families thank Joseph McCammon for his assistance in preparation of the manuscript."}
