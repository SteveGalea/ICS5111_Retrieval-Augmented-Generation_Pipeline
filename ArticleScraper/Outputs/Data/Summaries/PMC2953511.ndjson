{"summary": "influenza pandemic are characterized by the worldwide spread of novel influenza strains for which most of the population lack substantial immunity [1], [2]. the continued circulation of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses H5N1 has resulted in occasional coincident infections among humans. patients with severe H5N1 disease have unusually higher serum concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. levels of plasma macrophage attractant chemokines CXCL10 (IP-10), CXCL9 (MIG), and of neutrophil attractant interleukin-8 (IL-8) were substantially higher in patients with H5N1 disease compared with those experiencing seasonal influenza virus. a laboratory confirmed fatal human H5N1 virus infection. the virus can infect multi-organs besides pulmonary. high viral load is associated with increased host response. cells of immunologic system could not be excluded. the results of virus isolation, RT-PCR, ISH and IHC stains in selected tissues were negative. the results of virus isolation, RT-PCR, ISH and IHC staining were both negative. ureter tissue had the highest viral load of non respiratory system tissues. mRNA copies of macrophage attractant chemokine CXCL10 (IP-10), macrophage inflammatory protein 3 (MIP-3), RANTES, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and TNF- can be shown copies in cerebral context, left upper lobe lung, right middle lobe lung, right lower lobe the correlation is significant between viral load and levels of proinflammatory factors in various tissues. RANTES, IP-10, TNF-, TRAIL and MIP-3 genes were quantified by real-time RT-PCR. H&E stain showed diffuse alveolar damage characterized by intraalveolar edema, mononuclear inflammation cell infiltration, necrosis of alveolar lining cells, desquamation of pneumocytes in alveolar spaces and hyaline membrane formation. Lymph node was congested with depletion of lymphocytes. ISH stain with sense and antisense probes detected both virus RNA (with sense probe), mRNA and cRNA (with anti-sense probe) positive staining of ISH was detected in all samples except Bronchus, stomach and duodenum. positive staining was found in epithelial cell of lung (Fig. 4A), trachea and aortopulmonary vessel (Fig. 4B), but was not found in bronchus. fig. 5B), progenitor cells (co-labeled with CD34 fig. 5C) and follicular dendritic cells (co-labeled with CD35 fig. 5D) ISH stain with probes of NP gene and HA gene. positive stain (with NP sense probe) in nuclei and cytoplasm of pneumocytes. positive stain (with NP antisense probe) in lymphocytes of oxter lymph-node. positive stain (with NP antisense probe) in lymphocytes and monocytes from spleen. viral sequence presented in nucleic and cytoplasm of CD68+ cell. viral sequence positive stain presented in CD3+ T lymphocytes of spleen. virus culture, real-time RT-PCR, IHC and ISH were used to identify virus distribution in different tissues. sample ID Organ Virus isolation RRT- PCR ISH IHC (NP) NP H5 Respiratory system 1 Bronchus + + -/-* -/- - 2 Trachea + +/+ +/+ + 3 Aortopulmonary + +/+ +/+ +/+ + 4 Left-up lung + +/+ +/+ + 5 Left-down lung + +/+ +/+ + 6 Right-up lung + +/+ +/+ +/+ + ureter tissue had the highest viral load of non respiratory system tissues. mRNA copies of macrophage attractant chemokine CXCL10 (IP-10), macrophage inflammatory protein 3 (MIP-3), RANTES, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and TNF- can be found in tissues of brain, respiratory organ, spleen and lymph-node. significant between proinflammatory factors except between TRAIL and TNF- (p>0.05) and between TRAIL and IP-10(p>0.05) as well. similar with viral load assay, RANTES, IP-10, TNF-, TRAIL and MIP-3 genes in respiratory tissues, brains, lymph-node and spleen were quantified by real-time RT-PCR. intraalveolar edema, mononuclear inflammation cell infiltration, necrosis of alveolar lining cells, desquamation of pneumocytes in alveolar spaces and hyaline membrane formation. lymph node was congested with depletion of lymphocytes with congestion and organized infarcts. sense probes detected both virus RNA (with sense probe), mRNA and cRNA (with anti-sense probe) positive staining of ISH was detected in all samples except Bronchus, stomach and duodenum. positive staining was found in epithelial cell of lung (Fig. 4A), trachea and aortopulmonary vessel (fig. 4B), but not in bronchus. the results of ISH stain with probes of NP gene and HA gene. positive stain seen with diaminobenzidine (brown; Dako). slides counterstained with haematoxylin. positive stain (with NP antisense probe) in lymphocytes of oxter lymph-node (arrows) positive stain (with NP antisense probe) in lymphocytes and monocytes from spleen (arrows) positive stain (with NP antisense probe) in nuclei and cytoplasm of neuron from Cerebrum cortex (arrow) viral antigens or viral RNA can be found in trachea, lung, brain, intestines, liver, spleen, lymph-node and kidney which were reported as same before [20], [26], [27], [30], as well as in aortopulmonary vessel and ureter. the origin of infection in the extrapulmonary organs could be blood-borne. cell that has been postulated to be involved in pathogenesis of SARS [32] can not be excluded because previous in-vitro and/or in-vivo results have shown that the virus can replicate in multiple immune cells. viral load is the highest in tissues of respiratory system, especially, in left lower lobe of lung. renal duct showed a high viral load although PCR detection of kidney was negative. inflammatory protein can be produced by almost any infected cells and by immune cells, including alveolar macrophages. however, pneumocytes have a marked ability to secrete large amounts of cytokines, such as TNF-, GM-CSF, MCP, and IL-8, in response to various insults. the patient was laboratory confirmed as an H5N1 infection by china CDC on february 20, 2008. he bought 3 hens at an open-air market, one of which died later at same day. the patient presented with function damage of multiple organ (lung, heart, liver and kidney) on the second day after admission. twenty-four tissues were collected from respiratory, digestive, nervous, nervous and lymphatic organ systems. one sample was fixed in diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC) treated 10% formalin for pathologic analyses. a second sample was frozen at 80\u00b0C for virus isolation and molecular analyses. anhui/1/2005(H5N1), human house keeping gene beta\u2013actin and human cytokines/chemokines were used as positive controls. plasmids with entire M gene, beta\u2013actin gene segment and cytokines/chemokines gene segment were linearised by restriction enzyme. DNA concentration was measured as OD units at 260 nm. in vitro transcribed standard curve was generated using serial dilution of in vitro transcribed standard RNA (from 10 to 107 copies) the viral load and cytokines/chemokine levels are presented as the log10 value of the ratio between copies of the target gene and -actin gene. sections were counter-stained with a quick rinse in mayer's hematoxylin solution. sections were mounted with DPX and examined by light microscopy. probes were based in analysis of full haemagglutinin and nucleoprotein gene sequences of all Chinese human isolates of H5N1. negative controls included an unrelated antisense probe against the fragment of the heamaglutinin gene of the seasonal influenza virus H3N2. sections were incubated with 3% hydrogen peroxide to quench endogenous peroxidase activity. sections were then blocked with 10% normal horse serum for 10 min at RT. the patient was laboratory confirmed as an H5N1 infection by china CDC on february 20, 2008. the patient died 59 h after admission, and 8 days after the onset of symptoms. a cadaver was stored at 4\u00b0C and underwent autopsy about 18 h after death. samples were collected; one sample was fixed in diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC) treated 10% formalin for pathologic analyses. a second sample was frozen at 80\u00b0C for virus isolation and molecular analyses. plasmids with entire M gene, beta\u2013actin gene segment and cytokines/chemokines gene segment were linearised by restriction enzyme. transcribed RNA was purified using phenyl/chloroform solution. RNA copy number was then determined following the method of Fronhoffs. the standard curve was generated using serial dilution of in vitro transcribed standard RNA (from 10 to 107 copies) the viral load and cytokines/chemokine levels are presented as the log10 value of the ratio between copies of the target gene and -actin gene. for controls, we used unrelated antibodies in place of the primary antibody. probes were labeled by digoxigenin-UTP (Roche Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany) and tested for specificty using human biopsy of gut tissue with in vitro infection of H5N1 virus. sense probes were defined as the probes that detect the viral RNA (negative-stranded), while antisense probes detected complementary RNA (cRNA) negative controls included an unrelated antisense probe against the fragment of the heamaglutinin gene of the seasonal influenza virus H3N2. sections were incubated with 3% hydrogen peroxide to quench endogenous peroxidase activity. sections were then blocked with 10% normal horse serum for 10 min at RT. the viral HA gene and -actin gene copies in tissues were determined by quantified real-time RT-PCR. the ratios between HA and -actin gene copies were shown by logarithm."}
