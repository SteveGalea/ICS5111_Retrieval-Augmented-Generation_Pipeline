{"summary": "the outbreak originated in a hospital and then spread to the wider community. the disease took the lives of 286 people and 774 people worldwide. in total, there were 8,096 known cases. in the us, only 10% of 313 participants washed their hands for 15 seconds or longer. in the us, monk-Tuner et al. reported that only 2% of participating university students washed their hands for 15 seconds or more. in the us, monk-Tuner et al. reported that only 2% of participants washed their hands for 15 seconds or more. olos et al. found that female participants washed their hands significantly more than male participants. in the us, Duggan et al. found that an increase in age was linked to improved perceptions of hand-hygiene practices. in 2014, the CHP conducted a hand-hygiene survey. the results revealed that 6% of foreign domestic workers did not wash their hands after using the toilet. none of the participants rubbed their hands for 20 seconds or more, and none rubbed all areas of their hands. a comprehensive and in-depth exploration of hand-hygiene practices among Hong Kong adults is neglected. a comprehensive and in-depth exploration of hand-hygiene practices among Hong Kong people is neglected. a comprehensive and in-depth exploration of hand-hygiene practices among Hong Kong people is neglected. participants were required to report their demographic information, handwashing, and sources of handwashing information. 3.4. Procedure First, information sheets were given to the participants. the participants were asked to wash their hands under running water in a way that was typical for them. participants were the visitors to the barbecue sites whose age 18, mentally sound residents and those who communicated with Cantonese as cantonese is the mother tongue of Hong Kong people. participants who had experience working in healthcare settings and those with artificial nails, irremovable hand accessories, or a disability in both hands were excluded from this study. independent t-test and one-way ANOVA were used to compare the continuous data between variables in demographic data, duration of handwashing, and coverage of missed areas during handwashing. results Eventually, 190 (94 males and 96 females) valid data were collected from the barbeque sites in three main regions of Hong Kong. more than half of the participants washed their hands after handling vomitus or faecal matter (91.1%), after using the toilet (87.4%), before and after visiting a hospital or caring for the sick (72.6%), after having contact with animals or pets (61.6%) and before eating or handling food (58.4%). 84 (44.2%) received proper hand-hygiene information. participants took 36.54 seconds (range = 10\u2013120, SD = 18.57) to wash their hands. fingertips (48.1%), medial area (30.5%) and back of the hand (28%) were the most commonly missed areas in terms of washing. % Fingertips 48.1 Medial 30.5 Back of the hand 28 Palm 22.1 Lateral 22 Wrist 18.3 Interdigital 11 Back fingers 5.2 Front fingers 2.5 4.5. age is the only significant predictor of the total missed areas. more than half of the participants washed their hands after handling vomitus or faecal matter (91.1%), after using the toilet (87.4%), before and after visiting a hospital or care home. less than half of the participants washed their hands after coughing or sneezing (48.4%), after touching public installations or equipment (16.8%), and before touching their eyes, nose, and mouth (12.1%) participants took 36.54 seconds (range = 10\u2013120, SD = 18.57) to wash their hands. the majority of participants (86.8%) washed their hands for longer than 20 seconds. fingertips (48.1%), medial area (30.5%) and back of the hand (28%) were the most commonly missed areas. % Fingertips 48.1 Medial 30.5 Back of the hand 28 Palm 22.1 Lateral 22 Wrist 18.3 Interdigital 11 Back fingers 5.2 Front fingers 2.5 4.5. age is the only significant predictor of the total missed areas. the thumbs and fingertips were the most missed areas among healthcare workers in kodov\u00e1 et al.'s study. the medial aspect and back of the hand were the second and third most missed areas. however, the interdigital area and the front and back of the fingers were the least missed areas. study elicits the same results amongst caregivers in schools in kenya. participants aged 55 and older had good perceptions of hand hygiene. the age group with the poorest perceptions was those under 26 years of age. nearly 90% of participants completed their handwashing routine in 20 seconds or more. this contrasts with the studies conducted in the united states by Drankiewicz and Dundes, Shanks and Peteroy-Kelly. participants with higher education had fewer missed areas, and they performed handwashing on a more regular basis. however, Curtis et al. in kenya found that participants who received information about handwashing did wash their hands on a more frequent basis. research limitations This study did have its limitations. one of these limitations is the potential unease felt by the participants that evolved by asking for ad hoc handwashing at the venue. participants were not informed that time spent washing their hands was being recorded. hand-foot-mouth disease has been attacking Hong Kong frequently in recent years. the high population density of Hong Kong may exacerbate the risk of contracting communicable diseases through common contact surfaces such as door knobs, elevator buttons, handrails of escalators."}
