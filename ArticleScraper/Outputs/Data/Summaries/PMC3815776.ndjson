{"summary": "infections are responsible for approximately one third of all deaths occurring each year in the world. many of these are due to the lack efficient prophylaxis and treatment. infections are often the final cause of death in patients affected by other primary afflictions. adjuvants can modulate the quality and expand the breadth of the elicited response. most of the traditional vaccines have been administered via the parenteral route by subcutaneous (s.c.) or intramuscular (i.m.) injections do not deliver the vaccine optimally. both ways of antigen application can be summarized as cutaneous immunization. CI can induce strong humoral as well as cellular responses. the response is usually not restricted to the site of vaccination but can also be observed at distant mucosal sites. pathways for passive diffusion of small molecules have been identified. health will be impermeable to all but moderately lipophilic (octanol water partition coefficient logP 2\u20133) and relatively small molecules ( 500 Da) nanoparticles with a size below 5 m are ingested by a wide variety of phagocytic cells. carrier size could play a role in determining the type of response induced. carrier size could play a role in determining the type of response induced. this review will focus on opportunities for using nanoparticles for transcutaneous vaccination. the main part of the review will deal with nonbarrier compromising methods. the main part of the review will deal with nonbarrier compromising methods. the current knowledge on nanoparticle permeation across skin has been summarized by the Scientific Committee on Consumer Products (SCCP) there is no conclusive evidence for skin penetration into viable tissue for particles of about 20 nm and larger primary particle size. there is no information on the transadnexal penetration for particles under 20 nm. the SCCP report points out the lack of data for skin with impaired barrier function. there are no data available on the permeability of nanoparticles across sunburnt skin in humans. superfine nanoparticles are particles such as QDs, metal oxides, silver or gold nanoparticles with sizes usually less than 10 nm. one recent report where such superfine AuNPs (5 nm) were investigated for TCI. follicles only cover 0.1% of the total skin surface area. epidermal LCs accumulate around the follicles to build up a second immunologic line of defence in places where the mechanical barrier is weakened. the follicular capacity is very similar to that of the SC lipids. nanoparticles were made of biodegradable polymer polylacticcoglycolic acid (PLGA) using polyvinyl alcohol as a stabilizer. these nanoparticles permeated deeper and to a greater extent into hair follicles than an aqueous solution applied with similar physical force. 'nonactive' follicles were clogged by cellular debris. others needed reopening by washing or light peeling. this was surprising as directionality of hair growth and sebum flow are against the invasion of particles. a dynamic reorganization of TJs ensures that the TJ barrier remains intact to protect the body interior. there is evidence in literature that the transfollicular pathway can be used for TCI. thelium while local inflammation has been shown not to facilitate an immune response to a topically applied DNA vaccine. the transfollicular pathway has not been widely studied as a route of application of nanoparticle for TCI (apart from those using an additional barrier compromising technique such as cyanoacrylate stripping. nonimmunogenic vesicles made of 1,2 snglycerophospholipids may contain cholesterol for bilayer stabilization. they can incorporate molecules within the hydrophilic core, within the lipophilic or hydrophilic areas of the bilayer walls, or attached to the surface. ethosomes ethanol may work as a fluidizing agent on the intercellular lipid bilayers of the SC. flexible liposomes have been used to improve skin penetration of a wide range of active ingredients. compared ultraflexible liposomes (SoyPC, sodium deoxycholate) with niosomes (SoyPC, Span85 and cholesterol) and conventional liposomes (SoyPC, cholesterol) containing tetanus toxoid. in vitro diffusion cell experiment using nude rat skin tetanus toxoid was found in the receiver compartment with all formulations after a short incubation time. yPC containing hepatitis B surface antigen plasmid DNA (HBsAgDNA) on shaved mouse back. the IgG response towards the ultraflexible liposomes was superior to nonflexible liposomes and comparable to i.m. injection of naked DNA or HBsAg. a review on the use of liposomes and similar vesicles for mucosal and transcutaneous vaccination has recently been published. report of toxic heavy metal nanoparticles and industrial fullerene nanoparticles being found in the SC or even in deeper viable skin layers. there is an absence of appropriate information for skin with impaired barrier function, e.g. atopic skin or sunburned skin. there is no information on transadnexal penetration for particles under 20 nm. there is no information on the transadnexal penetration for particles under 20 nm. in vivo noninvasive multiphoton imaging they could show that ZnO nanoparticles penetrated deeply into lesion furrows and from there spread laterally into the SC. this confirms the results of another in vivo study in psoriatic patients where no systemic increase in zinc levels was found after topical application of ZnO nanoparticles. saline solution of CT applied to shaved mouse back induces high levels of CTspecific IgG antibodies. Cholera toxin is also known for its permeabilizing effect. HRP/AuNPs and gal/AuNPs were detected at similar skin depths. epidermal LCs accumulate around the follicles to build up a second immunologic line of defence in places where the mechanical barrier is weakened. nano and micron sized particulate carriers that are applied to the skin accumulate in the follicle openings, sebaceous glands or skin folds. cles in pig ear skin a maximum penetration depth was reported for particles with a size of approximately 650 nm (Toll et al., 2004; Ossadnik et al., 2006; Patzelt et al., 2011). the size optimum depends on species, body site and hair type (e.g. vellus and terminal hair follicles). epidermal LCs elongate their dendrites to penetrate KCs. a dynamic reorganization of TJs between KCKC and KCLC contacts ensures that the TJ barrier remains intact to protect the body interior. hair follicles only proliferate during the anagen state. plucking may damage the follicular epithelial barrier. local inflammation has been shown not to facilitate an immune response to a topically applied DNA vaccine. transfollicular immunization requires much higher doses of vaccine to be applied. liposomes are nonimmunogenic vesicles made of 1,2 snglycerophospholipids. they may contain cholesterol for bilayer stabilization. flexible liposomes are pulled across the SC via the intercorneocyte lipid channels by the transepithelial hydration gradient. this mechanism brings them rapidly towards the deeper layers of the SC, close to the epidermis, so that they possibly get accessible to LCs sampling the environment. induction of serum IgG and IgA in mice on topical application of \u2018transferosomes\u2019 containing gap junction proteins (Gaptransferosomes) with or without the addition of monophosphoryl lipid A. responses to topically applied Gaptransferosomes were strongly superior to topically applied Gapmixed micelles and Gapconventional liposomes. both topical formulations induced serum IgG and systemic and mucosal IgA response in BALB/c mice. serum IgG was comparable to i.m. injection, serum and salivary IgA levels were even superior. al vaccination had fewer histopathologic anomalies after RSV challenge than did mice receiving i.m. vaccination or controls. by combining a cationic lipid (DOTAP, dioleoyl trimethylammonium propane), geusens and coworkers created the first cationic deformable liposomes. these carriers achieved high transfection efficiencies of siRNA in vitro. the main principles permeation enhancers may use for improving percutaneous penetration of other compounds are: (i) perturbation, fluidization or disruption of SC lipids; (ii) extraction of membrane components; (iii) increase of the compound solubility within the SC membrane; (iv) improvement of skin hydration; and (v) interaction with keratin. mainly rodent skin acts differently towards chemical penetration enhancers when compared with human skin. the use of SDS in vivo is problematic due to its strong sensitization potential. a historical example where this concept has successfully been employed is the immunization against smallpox that finally led to the eradication of the disease. a system that has made it into clinical testing is the HIV1/AIDS DermaVir patch. it contains a plasmid DNA vaccine (pDNA) encoding for all major HIV1 antigen and the formation of virus like particles. pDNA is formulated as pathogenlike mannosylated polyethyleneimine nanoparticles (80\u2013400 nm) the clinical trial database of the US national institute of health lists several studies using the DermaVir patch evaluating safety, tolerability and efficacy. this study looked at 12 individuals on combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) who were immunized with the vaccine with or without the addition of hydroxyurea. nanotechnology holds great promise for vaccination and especially TCI. key issues to be solved in the future are how nano delivery devices can transport a sufficient dose of the vaccine across the SC. ultraflexible liposomes are the best investigated carriers in this aspect."}
