During the diarrhoeic period, 9/24 calves treated with Podophyllum and 3/20 treated with a placebo excreted rotavirus in the faeces. 5% of the calves showed additional signs of illness, such as fever, depression and/or inappetence. a comparison between calves up to 2 weeks of age and calves older than 6 weeks showed that depression, inappetence and fever were present more frequently in the youngest animals. regulation no. 1804/1999 rules for organic livestock production are being set up. priority is often given to homeopathic treatment rather than allopathic veterinary medicine on organic farms. veterinary practitioners Helen Loor, Cecilia Hamilton and Sven Viring for practical support."}
