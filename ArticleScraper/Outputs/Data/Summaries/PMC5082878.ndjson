{"summary": "in recent times, we have seen geographical spread of cases of zoonotic diseases at unprecedented distances from the initial source of the outbreak. this raises the concern that other viruses that are currently restricted to more localised geographic areas, such as Nipah Virus (NiV) may spread to many other countries. there have been cases of NiV in Bangladesh most years since it was first documented in 2001. in 2014 there were 30 human cases including 18 deaths. the main risk factor for initial human infection with the Bangladesh strain of NiV is consumption of date palm sap contaminated by bats. model framework has been designed so it can be readily parameterised for other viruses (e.g. EBOV and MERS-CoV) model results for the NiV parameterisation are presented, including scenario analyses, followed by a discussion on the issues surrounding development and parameterisation of a generic model framework. 3.2 Output The main output of the baseline model is an estimate of the annual probability of at least one introduction event into each EU MS, j, PV(j) the main output of the baseline model is an estimate of the annual probability of at least one introduction event into each EU MS, j, PV(j) the risk assessment model is initiated by determining the \u2018exporting countries\u2019, i.e. countries where virus infection is strongly suspected to be circulating in bats, humans, or other animal species. for each route, the risk of an introduction event (i.e. importation of at least one infected/contaminated product per year) from each selected exporting country to each EU MS was assessed, by calculating the annual probability that at least one product is infected/contaminated upon entry into the MS. the risk of exposure to and infection with viruses may differ between these groups. a major route of NiV-Bangladesh transmission to humans is through consumption of date palm sap [29, 30], a traditional practice in some rural Bangladesh communities. visitors to exporting country k may only be there a short while and thus have a shorter time for exposure than local residents. the infected population that may travel is those individuals currently undiagnosed and incubating disease. this population is estimated by multiplying the prevalence of infection in passenger type i, (i,k) by the incubation period of the virus, TIP(k) if TDK(k) exceeds 365 days then the passenger is there for the whole year and so the risk is equal to the baseline human prevalence in country k. some trade products may have been contaminated with virus from wildlife reservoir species in the exporting country, thereby posing a risk to the EU. the baseline model is set up for possible reduction of virus on the product prior to harvesting, Cenv(k,l), during processing, Cproc(k,l), and during transport to the EU MS. the reduction at processing is a simple log reduction based on the type of processing undertaken, while the reductions at harvesting and during transport are calculated based on the half-life of the virus during that period. stage (THLenv(k,l) and CHLtrans(k,l) respectively) represent the number of half-lives of the virus during that stage. the default estimate for the prevalence of contamination in the raw products, pGraw(k) is based on the estimated prevalence of active virus shedding in bats, pBinf(k), the bat contact rate with the product, pBcontact(k) and seasonality of the virus. animal species from an exporting country may become infected if they are susceptible and are exposed to an infectious dose of virus. similar to humans, there may be a sub-clinical phase where these animals could arrive into the EU with undetected infection, or like bats in the case of NiV. bushmeat is a generic term to describe meat from a variety of wild animal species. it is generally illegal to bring such products into the EU. it is generally illegal to bring such products into the EU. pBMSp(s) denotes the proportion of all bushmeat that is from species s. pBMIn(s,j,k) is the probability of an individual consignment of contaminated bushmeat successfully making it into MS j. the actual number of bushmeat consignments entering the EU from country k is estimated based on the number of bushmeat consignments seized in the EU MS. under traditional OIE guidelines, there are three components of risk assessment: entry assessment, exposure assessment and consequence assessment. the model does not consider the potential exposure of humans, livestock or wildlife to the virus and the subsequent consequences given incursion. the model is coded in the R software package. routes included in baseline model were human travel, PH(j), legal trade of \u2018at risk\u2019 products (e.g. non-animal foodstuffs), PG(j), legal movement of susceptible animals (e.g. livestock, companion animals and those destined for scientific research or zoos), PA(j) and illegal bushmeat trade, PB(j). the risk of an introduction event (i.e. importation of at least one infected/contaminated product per year) from each selected exporting country to each EU MS was assessed by calculating the annual probability that at least one product (i.e. human, animal, product of animal origin or foodstuffs) is infected/contaminated upon entry into the MS. this estimate takes into account factors such as the probability an individual unit is infected (or contaminated) in the exporting country. NH(i,j,k) be the total number of passengers of type i travelling from country k to MS j in one year and pHin(i,k) be the probability that at least one infected human enters MS j, PH(j) it is assumed that any individual exhibiting clinical symptoms prior to travelling will not travel as planned. p H i n ( i, k ) = ( i, k ) = ( i, k ) = ( i, k ) = ( i, k ) * T I P ( k ) 365. the baseline prevalence of infection in the exporting country is weighted by the average duration of stay (days) in the exporting country, TDK(i,k), ( i, k ) = n d generally have shown visible signs of contamination, which may not be the case with the viruses considered here. NG(j,k,l,m) be the number of products of type l from exporting country k to MS j via transport route m in one year, then the probability that at least one contaminated trade product enters MS j in a year. the calculation of a(j,k,l,m) will vary depending on the data used to parameterise it. the baseline model is set up for possible reduction of virus on the product prior to harvesting, Cenv(k,l), during processing, Cproc(k,l), and during transport to the EU MS, Ctrans(j,k,l,m). the default estimate for the prevalence of contamination in raw products, pGraw(k) is based on the estimated prevalence of active virus shedding in bats, pBinf(k), the bat contact rate with the product, pBcontact(k) and seasonality of the virus, i.e. the proportion of the year that bats can shed the virus, pseason(k) p G r a w ( k ) = p B i n f pAinf(s,k) be the prevalence of virus in species s in country k and TAID(s,k) be the time to clinical signs in species s, then pAinf(s,k) be the time to clinical signs in species s. pAinf(s,k) be the prevalence of virus in species s in country k and pAinf(s,k) be the time to clinical signs in species s. bushmeat is a generic term to describe meat from a variety of wild animal species. it is generally illegal to bring such products into the EU. other species reported as bushmeat, such as non-human primates, are known to be susceptible to a number of bat-borne viruses. the actual number of bushmeat consignments entering the EU from country k is estimated based on the number of bushmeat consignments seized in the EU MS, Nseized(i,j,k) and an under-reporting factor based on the proportion of passengers luggage that are searched. human travel has become an increasingly important pathway for the rapid introduction and proliferation of infectious diseases in recent years. the risk of exposure to and infection with viruses may differ between these groups. a major route of NiV-Bangladesh transmission to humans is through consumption of date palm sap [29, 30], a traditional practice in some rural rural communities. visitors to exporting country k may only be there a short while and thus have a shorter time for exposure than local residents. the infected population is estimated by multiplying the prevalence of infection in passenger type i, (i,k) by the incubation period of the virus, TIP(k). this population is estimated by multiplying the prevalence of infection in passenger type i, (i, k) by the incubation period of the virus, i.e. sub-clinically infected. the risk is equal to the baseline human prevalence in country k. some trade products, such as fruit, may have been contaminated with virus from wildlife reservoir species in the exporting country. a few interceptions in recent years have been due to the presence of viruses. c0(x) be probability density function associated with initial viral load. a(j,k,l,m) be the initial concentration necessary for the product to still be considered contaminated upon arrival at the EU MS. the calculation of a(j,k,l,m) will vary depending on the data used to parameterise it. the default estimate for the prevalence of contamination in raw products, pGraw(k), is based on the estimated prevalence of active virus shedding in bats, pBinf(k), the bat contact rate with the product, pBcontact(k) and seasonality of the virus, i.e. the proportion of the year that bats can shed the virus, pseason(k) p G r a w ( k ) = p B i n f animal species from an exporting country may become infected if they are susceptible and are exposed to an infectious dose of virus. pAinf(s,k) be the prevalence of virus in species s in country k and pAinf(s,k) be the time to clinical signs in species s. bushmeat is a generic term to describe meat from a variety of wild animal species. it is generally illegal to bring such products into the EU. it is generally illegal to bring such products into the EU. pBMSp(s) denotes the proportion of all bushmeat that is from species s. pBMIn(s,j,k) is the probability of an individual consignment of contaminated bushmeat successfully making it into MS j. the actual number of bushmeat consignments entering the EU from country k is estimated based on the number of bushmeat consignments seized in the EU MS. parameterisation of generic framework for entry of bat-borne zoonotic viruses into the.
