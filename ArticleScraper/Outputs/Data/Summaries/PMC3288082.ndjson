{"summary": "incidence of IPA infection has increased in the last years due to the use of immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory drugs. early recognition of A. fumigatus by myeloid leukocytes is crucial for down-stream immune response and conidia clearance. studies have shown that C-type lectins are not only involved in the recognition of fungal pathogens but also in the induction of anti-fungal Th1 and Th17 immune responses [5], [11]. however, it has been suggested that DC-SIGN promotes dendritic cell migration and T-cell activation through the ICAM-3 binding [12], [13] and modulates TLR signalling by targeting Raf-1. the aim of the present study was to investigate the role of tagging and potentially functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms located within the DC-SIGN, Dectin-1, Dectin-2, MCP-1/CCL2 and CCR2 genes on IPA susceptibility. the population included 182 hematological patients recruited between January 2004 and January 2011. serum galactomannan antigen was determined twice weekly during hospital stay and at each outpatient visit until the end of their immunosuppressant or chemotherapeutic treatment. serum GM concentrations were determined by Platelia Aspergillus ELISA kit (Bio-Rad, Marnes-la-Coquette, France) according to manufacturer's instructions. the functional approach was used to determine the net impact of potentially functional variants within DC-SIGN, Dectin-1, Dectin-2, CCL2 and CCR2 genes on IPA risk. in this selection we forced the inclusion of the DC-SIGN rs4804803, CCL2 rs1024610 and CCL2 rs1024611 polymorphisms. recycling conditions were 94\u00b0C for 10 sec, annealing and elongation at 60\u00b0C for 60 sec. PCR products were analyzed with the ABI Prism 7900HT detection system using the SDS 2.4 software (Applied Biosystems) about 5% of samples were randomly selected and included as duplicate. intron - C/G Unknown - DC-SIGN_c.74928 rs11465384 3\u2032-UTR - C/T 3\u2032-UTR affecting RNA expression. Platinga et al. 2009 Dectin-1 (CLEC7A)_c.714 rs16910526 Coding exon Y238X A/C Defective expression and lack of b-glucan recognition byPhagocytes intron - C/G Unknown - Dectin-1 (CLEC7A)_c.3751404 rs7309123 Intron - C/G Unknown - Dectin-1 (CLEC7A)_c.255+813 rs3901533 Intron - C/T Unknown - Dectin-1 (CLEC7A)_c.104520 rs4763446 Intron - C/T Unknown - Dec hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium tests were performed in the control group (non-IPA patients) by a standard observed-expected chi-square (2) test at each polymorphic site. the more common allele was assigned as the reference category. all tests were considered statistically significant with a p value of 0.05. we calculated for each gene the \u201cnumber of effective independent variables\u201d (Meff) by adding up the gene Meff's. RNA extraction, reverse transcription, and qPCR Whole blood samples from 21 healthy donors were collected into PAXGENE RNA tubes. total RNAs were extracted using a PAXGENE Blood RNA Isolation Kit (PreAnalytiX) and reverse transcribed to cDNA using QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit. cross-validation and permutation testing were used to identify best models. all possible two-, three- and four-way interactions were tested using 100-fold cross-validation and the exhaustive search. serum galactomannan antigen was determined twice weekly during the hospital stay and at each outpatient visit until the end of their immunosuppressant or chemotherapeutic treatment. serum GM concentrations were determined by Platelia Aspergillus ELISA kit (Bio-Rad, Marnes-la-Coquette, France) according to the manufacturer's instructions. SNP selection and genotyping Twenty-seven tagging/functional SNPs within DC-SIGN, Dectin-1, Dectin-2, CCL2 and CCR2 were selected to genotype the entire panel of individuals. the aim of the SNP tagging was to identify a set of SNPs that efficiently tags all the known SNPs while the functional approach was used to determine the net impact of potentially functional variants within DC-SIGN. PCR products were analyzed with the ABI Prism 7900HT detection system using the SDS 2.4 software (Applied Biosystems) about 5% of samples were randomly selected and included as duplicate. infection and immune-related diseases such as HIV-1, dengue, TB, parenteral infection, SARS, RA. the disease is associated with risk of parenteral infection, HIV-1, HCV, dengue and tuberculosis. UTR affecting RNA expression - Dectin-1 (CLEC7A)_c.714 rs16910526 Coding exon Y238X A/C Defective expression and lack of b-glucan recognition byPhagocytes. associated with increased Aspergillus and Candida colonization in hematopoietic transplant recipients Ferwerda et al. intron - C/T Unknown - CCL2 (MCP-1)_c.903 rs4586 Coding exon C35C C/T Associated with an increased risk of TB Thye et al. 2009 CCL2 (MCP-1)_c.2136 rs1024610 Promoter - CCL2 (MCP-1)_c.2518 rs1024611 Promoter - C/T Correlate with MCP-1 unconditional logistic regression was used to assess the main effects of the genetic polymorphisms on IPA risk using co-dominant, dominant and recessive inheritance models. all analyses were adjusted for age, gender, hematological malignancy and established risk factors for IPA infection (HSCT, neutropenia, GVHD and corticoid therapy use) RNA extraction, reverse transcription, and qPCR Whole blood samples from 21 healthy donors were collected into PAXGENE RNA tubes and stored at 80\u00b0C until use. real-time quantitative PCR was carried out using an ABI PRISM\u00ae 7500 HT Sequence Detection System. cycles of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 15 seconds combined with annealing at 60\u00b0C for 30 seconds and extension at 72\u00b0C for 30 seconds. all samples were run in duplicate. HSCT, neutropenia, GVHD and corticoid therapy use were homogenously distributed between IPA and non-IPA patients. HSCT, neutropenia, GVHD and corticoid therapy use were homogenously distributed. ukemia, HL: Hodgekin's lymphoma, NHL: non-Hodgekin's lymphoma, AA: Aplastic anemia, AA: Aplastic anemia, CLL: chronic lymphocytic leukemia, MDS: myelodysplastic syndrome. five-seven patients were diagnosed with proven or probable IPA infection. patients carrying the DC-SIGN rs2287886_A allele showed a tendency to be associated with a decreased risk of IPA infection. patients carrying the DC-SIGN rs2287886_A allele showed a tendency to be associated with a decreased risk of IPA infection. 0.012 per T allele 2.45 (1.16\u20135.17) 0.019 DC-SIGN_rs7248637 G/G 35 (62.5) 95 (76.6) 1.00 G/A 19 (33.9) 25 (20.2) 2.46 (1.09\u20135.58) A/A 2 (3.6) 4 (3.2) 1.90 (0.27\u201313.41) 0.088 G/A+A/A 21 (37.5) 29 (23.4) 2.39 (1.09\u20135.22) 0.028 per 0.042 1 Models adjusted for age, gender, hematological malignancy, HSCT, neutropenia (defined as absolute neutrophil count 500 cells/mm3 for a period of more than 10 days), GVHD and corticoid therapy use (>0.3 mg/kg/day). differences in samples numbers are due to failures in genotyping. the results showed that subjects harbouring GG genotype showed a significantly decreased level of Dectin-1 mRNA expression compared to C-allele carriers. the results further supported our hypothesis suggesting that Dectin-1rs7309123_G allele may disrupt binding sites for potential transcription factors. the best two-locus model consisted of the Dectin-1 rs3901533 and DC-SIGN rs4804800 SNPs. this model had a testing accuracy of 0.6409 and a cross-validation consistency of 76/100. the best three-locus model included the CCL2 rs4586, Dectin-1 rs3901533 and Dectin-2 rs7134303. interaction dendrogram was used to confirm, visualize, and interpret the interaction model. the colors used depict the degree of synergy, ranging from red (highest information gain) to blue (highest information redundancy). the highest risk of IPA infection was found for carriers of the Dectin-1 rs3901533_T and Dectin-1 rs7309123_G/G genotypes and the DC-SIGNrs4804800_G alleles. patients carrying these genotypes/alleles showed a 2-fold increased risk in comparison with patients harboring the wild-type allele. no differences were found when positive GM determinations were correlated with DC-SIGN polymorphisms. these data along with the remarkable degree of association of Dectin-1 and DC-SIGN variants with risk of IPA infection. we correlated Dectin-1 mRNA expression levels with Dectin-1rs7309123 genotypes. these results further supported our hypothesis suggesting that Dectin-1rs7309123 SNP may have an effect on the Dectin-1-mediated recognition of Aspergillus conidia. this predicted change in transcription activity is only suggestive at this stage and will need further validation using in vitro functional assays. Platinga et al. (2009) and Cunha et al. (2010) suggested that patients carrying the Y238X polymorphism in the Dectin-1 gene were more likely to be colonized with Aspergillus and Candida species [19], [63], compared with those harboring the wild-type allele. however, these results were not replicated in a very recent study [24]. 1Models adjusted for age, gender, hematological malignancy, HSCT, neutropenia. assuming a recessive model of inheritance. differences in samples numbers are due to failures in genotyping."}
