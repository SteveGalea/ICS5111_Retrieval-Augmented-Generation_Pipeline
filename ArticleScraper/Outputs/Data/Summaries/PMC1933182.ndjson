{"summary": "biologists often possess more knowledge regarding function, structure or conserved patterns of sequences to be analyzed. it is generally desirable to have such information incorporated into an alignment procedure, so that the alignment result can be more biologically meaningful. web-based systems, muSiC (15) and muSiC-ME (16) were also developed. from now on these two systems will be referred to as muSiC jointly. RE-MuSiC (multiple Sequence Alignment with Regular Expression Constraints) is a well-known web server that can handle user-defined constraints as anchor points. in DIALIGN, a constraint consists of the exact positions of a pair of equal-length segments on two of the sequences, where these two segments are expected to be aligned together. the constraints follow the PROSITE pattern format. each constraint is put within quotes, and adjacent constraints are separated by space characters. the user needs to specify whether the input sequences are proteins or DNA/RNA. sequence alignment tools are essential to biological research. it is generally desirable to have such information incorporated into an alignment procedure. a typical alignment tool often fails to achieve this. muSiC (15) and muSiC-ME (16) were also developed. a fragment in the 3\u2032 untranslated region (3\u2032-UTR) of a SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) coronavirus sequence can fold into a pseudoknot. the first residue is Cys, followed by one residue of any kind, then a Cys, followed by two residues of any kind, then a Gly or Pro, etc. regular expressions are also convenient in describing variable ranges between patterns or between blocks within a pattern, which is necessary for some single patterns themselves. the user enters or pastes input sequences (in FASTA format) in the largest blank field. the format for the constraints follows the PROSITE pattern format. each constraint is put within quotes, and adjacent constraints are separated by space characters. the user needs to specify whether the input sequences are proteins or DNA/RNA. in the resulting alignment, RE-MuSiC annotated the region for the satisfaction of the constraint with a yellow block. it can be seen that the G-site residues are aligned properly, as desired. the default parameter settings are adopted for both tools. supplementary material is available at http://140.113.239.131/RE-MUSIC/RE_MuSiC_method.pdf. in a reasonable alignment of GST protein sequences, the residues for the G-site are expected to be aligned together. the result is shown in Figure 2a, where active site residues shared by these GSTs are boxed. it can be seen that, part of the G-site residues failed to be aligned together, due to the low sequence similarity among these GST proteins. using this pattern, RE-MuSiC is applied to align the sequences again. four coronaviruses from different groups are considered in this experiment. the first two are group 1 coronaviruses, while the others belong to group 2. a consensus of the pseudoknots is to be taken. this demonstrates that RE-MuSiC can be used to predict the pseudoknot in the 3\u2032-UTR of the SARS-TW1 coronavirus. this property had been used to predict the pseudoknot in the 3\u2032-UTR of the SARS-TW1 coronavirus by aligning the 3\u2032-UTR with those of some other coronaviruses. a structural superposition of the crystal structures suggests that most of these G-site residues should be aligned together. the sequence identity between the A. thaliana GST and each of other six non-plant GSTs is no more than 20.2%. as expected, the common pattern is aligned together. while the G-site residues are aligned properly, as desired. this suggests that RE-MuSiC is more reliable to produce alignments in which biologically important residues can be lined up. the first two are group 1 coronaviruses, while the others belong to group 2. first, ClustalW is applied to align these coronavirus sequences. the result is shown in Figure 3a. the consensus of the pseudoknots on the four coronaviruses involves variable ranges between residues. RE-MuSiC has a constraint formulation flexible enough to express this consensus. this is a significant advance over previous generations of MuSiC. for prediction purposes."}
