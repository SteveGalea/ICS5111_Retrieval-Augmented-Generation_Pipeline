{"summary": "the VEEV envelope contains two glycoproteins E1 (mediates cell membrane fusion) and E2 (binds receptor and elicits virus neutralizing antibodies) no specific treatment for VEE; however virus-neutralizing mMAbs are potent protective and therapeutic agents for mice challenged with VEEV by either peripheral or aerosol routes. VEEV-neutralizing capacity of the hMAb F5 nIgG is similar to that shown by the humanized mMAb Hy4 IgG. administration of a cocktail of F5n and Hy4 IgGs could provide enhanced prophylaxis or immunotherapy for VEEV. type VEEVs occurred in Peru and Panama (VEEV-1D), and in the mexican states of Chiapas and Oaxaca (VEEV-1E) VEEV has potential as a bioweapon, mainly because of its low human infective dose, easy production, and capability for effective transmission by aerosolization. experimental vaccines (TC-83, C-84) have been used to protect laboratory personnel and military troops, but are not licensed for general use. anti-E2c mMAb 1A4A-1 and anti-E2g mMAb 1A3A-9 have been shown to provide post-exposure protection when administered within 24 hr after virus inoculation. anti-E2c mMAb 1A4A-1 and anti-E2g mMAb 1A3A-9, as well as humanized anti-E2c mMAb Hy4 IgG, have been shown to provide post-exposure a panel of 11 hFabs for VEEV surface protein specificity, subtype cross-reactivity, and in vitro virus-neutralizing capacity were isolated. two anti-E2 hFabs, one of which (F5) exhibited potent neutralizing activity, were converted to fully human IgG1 molecules. VEEV TC-83 used for panning phage display libraries was inactivated with 0.05% or 0.3% -propiolactone (BPL) in 0.1M Tris base, pH 9, for 48 h at 4\u00b0C. inactivated virus was verified by inoculation of Vero cells, which were monitored for cytopathic effects. cDNA was purified with a PCR purification kit (Qiagen) the amplified products were digested with Xba I/Sac I for the kappa light chains (LCs), Xba I/Kas I for the lambda LCs, and Xho I/Age I (Pin AI) for the heavy chains (HCs) and cloned into Fab expression phagemid vectors. ELISA screening on inactivated VEEV TC-83 virus performed in high throughput mode. colonies were grown overnight in deep-well microtiter dishes in a hi-Gro high-speed incubator-shaker. soluble Fab expression and purification was removed from positive candidates. Fab expression and purification Fabs selected for characterization were cloned into a Fab expression vector, PAEV1. two Fabs, K1B11 and K1H3, which had Eco RI sites in their LCs were cloned into a PAEV1 vector containing Fab L1A7 LCs and HCs by using the Xba I/Age I sites. cytomegalovirus promoter to direct expression of the HC, and an HC mammalian leader sequence. the intermediate was inserted via restriction sites Sfi I and Age I into a mammalian expression vector. the resulting \u201cengineered\u201d IgG1 differed from the n sequence due to the few non-n aa codons at the N-terminus of both LC and HC. a purified antibody showed specific binding to inactivated VEEV TC-83. a dilution of each unconjugated mMAb, hMAb, or hFab that resulted in approximately 70% binding to VEEV TC-83 was determined by titration in an indirect ELISA. dilutions of MAb conjugates that resulted in an A405 of approximately 1.0 were also determined for use in CBAs. wells coated with 1 g VEEV TC-83 overnight and then blocked with 3% goat serum in PBS for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. d goat anti-human IgG F(ab\u2032)2 or goat anti-mouse IgG visualized with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate/nitroblue tetrazolium phosphatase substrate. the PRNT for IgG or Fab antibody fragments was performed as previously described. RNA was eluted in 30\u201340 l of nuclease-free water and stored at 80\u00b0C. amplimers for sequencing the glycoprotein-coding region of pVE/IC-92 were generated by standard RT-PCR performed with either 5 or 10 l of template RNA and 20 pmol of each primer. initial RT was performed at 50\u00b0C for 30 min followed by denaturation at 96\u00b0C for 2 min. VEEV TC-83 was inactivated with 0.05% or 0.3% -propiolactone (BPL) in 0.1M Tris base, pH 9, for 48 h at 4\u00b0C. inactivated virus was verified by inoculation of Vero cells, which were monitored for cytopathic effects. messenger RNA was isolated using Oligotex spin columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) to amplify mRNA. first strand cDNA was synthesized using superScript II reverse transcriptase. second strand cDNA was synthesized according to the manufacturer's protocol. the bound Fab-phage were eluted with 2M glycine, pH 2.2, neutralized with 2M Tris base, used to infect log phase E. coli cells, strain ER 2738, and amplified by adding helper phage, strain VCSM13. individual colonies were produced by plating infected bacteria for each round of panning. hMAbs F2 engineered (e) IgG and H6 eIgG were cloned into a Fab expression vector. two Fabs, K1B11 and K1H3, were cloned into a PAEV1 vector. the selected Fabs were produced in BL21 E. coli cells with induction by isopropyl--D-thiogalactopyranoside. four hFabs (F2, F5, G1 and H6) were converted to full-length IgG1s in a two-step cloning process. the region between LC and HC was replaced with mammalian control elements. the resulting \u201cengineered\u201d IgG1 differed from the n sequence due to the few non-n aa codons at three restriction sites. the two wells with the highest antibody expression were chosen for single cell selection in four 96-well plates. one of these clones, IE9, was grown in 1.5 L and 6 L cultures. the purified antibody showed specific binding to inactivated VEEV TC-83 that was comparable to that of F5 nIgG. conjugated mMAb, hMAb, or hFab that resulted in approximately 70% binding to VEEV TC-83 was determined by titration in an indirect ELISA. dilutions of MAb conjugates that resulted in an A405 of approximately 1.0 were also determined for use in CBAs. Membranes were blocked with StartingBlock buffer (Pierce) at 4\u00b0C. membrane strips were incubated with the purified hMAbs and hFabs. protein E1- and E2-specific mMAbs for 2 h at room temperature. RNA was eluted in 30\u201340 l of nuclease-free water and stored at 80\u00b0C. PCR included 10 cycles of 96\u00b0C for 20 sec, 52\u00b0C for 30 sec, 68\u00b0C for 2.5 min. amplimers were gel purified using a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit. two donor bone marrows, 951 and 1037, were selected for use in phage display libraries. a panel of hFab clones from panning rounds three and four for each of four libraries was screened on VEEV TC-83. the sequencing results showed that all three 951 clones were identical. a stable cell line expressing F5 nIgG was generated in 293-EBNA cells. an attempt was made to identify additional anti-VEEV hFabs using libraries from donors 951 and 1037. nine new hFabs were isolated, four using epitope masking protocol. seven of 11 antibodies were specific for the E2 glycoprotein and four for E1. all the E2-specific antibodies recognized both reduced and non-reduced protein. the E1-specific antibodies lost reactivity after proteins were subjected to reducing conditions (exposition to 2-mercaptoethanol) hE1a 1 K1H3E ++ ++ ++ + ++ >100 +/ hE1b 10 L1A7E ++ ++ ++ ++ ++ ++ ++ >100 +/ A MAb tested as full antibody (H6, F5, and Hy4) or Fab. cross-reactivity reported as percent of each MAb's reactivity with subtype 1AB (VEEV TC-83); ++ (>50%), + (25\u2013 each antibody in ELISA and the sequence data for MAb and Fab HC and LC complementary determining region 3 (HCDR3, LCDR3) are presented in graphical form. antibodies with similar cross-reactivities had unique titration curves when concentration was plotted versus absorbance at 405 nm (Figures 1, 2).

ELISA cross-reactivity patterns for VEEV E1-specific human (h) Fabs. LR3H11 had a generally lower level of reactivity to all the VEEV subtypes. the higher reactivity level of H6 eIgG could be due to the fact that H6 is a complete IgG molecule. HCDR3 sequence is the same for LR3H11 and the anti-hE2b Fabs. Fabs L1A7 and K2E2 had unique HCDR3 and LCDR3 sequences. they were assigned to epitopes hE1b and hE1c respectively. none of the anti-hE2a2, -hE2b, -hE2d, -hE1a, -hE1b, or -hE1c Fabs showed >50% competition. compatriot Fab, IgG EpitopeA F5 nIgG hE2c 92 Not done F5 Fab hE2c 91 63 LR3H11 Fab hE2a2 26 6 KR2B12 Fab hE2b 38 4 KR2C2 Fab hE2b 38 4 KR2C2 Fab hE2b 38 4 KR2C2 Fab hE2b 38 4 humanized anti-E2c MAbs 1A4A-1 and Hy4-IgG competed with F5-HRP. however, there was no competition between F5 and anti-E2g or anti-E2h mMAbs. 93 52 95 30 95 A humanized murine MAb is added to ELISA plate 30 min prior to addition of MAb-HRP conjugates. competition percentages 50% were considered significant and are shown in bold font.
