{"summary": "Methods We conducted a systematic review of literature related to S. pneumoniae and pneumococcal vaccines. we used the search terms \u201cS. pneumoniae\u201d or \u201cpneumococcus\u201d and combined them with the terms \u201cvaccines\u201d or \u201cprevention\u201d for the period from March 01, 2000, to March 01, 2016. Substantive reviews and guidelines identified on the subject have been referenced. no large-scale controlled studies have been conducted in Saudi Arabia. the true burden of pneumococcal infections is unknown. the incidence during the 1st year of life was almost 4 times more than the average incidence in the following 4 years. in 1988, a report from Saudi Arabia showed that all S. pneumoniae isolates were sensitive to penicillin and vancomycin, but 65% were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. recent reports show that more than half of pneumococcal isolates are now resistant to penicillin. over >90 distinct pneumococcal serotypes have been identified. in general, immunity following infection is serotype-specific. cross-protection between related serotypes could occur. the incidence range of IPD in children aged 5 years was 3.4\u201353.5/100,000 population. the case fatality and morbidity rates for pneumococcal meningitis were 0\u201322% and 10\u201362% respectively. PPSV23 and (2) pneumococcal protein-conjugate vaccine are recommended for use. both vaccines are inactivated and do not contain any live organisms. the adult vaccine (PPSV23) protects against 23 strains. PPSV23 has limited efficacy in children 2 years, nonbacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia, otitis media, exacerbations of COPD, multiple myeloma, lymphoma, and chronic alcoholism. PPSV23 requires periodic revaccination to maintain protective efficacy. the pneumococcal protein-conjugate vaccine PCV7 contains capsular polysaccharides from 7 serotypes. it was approved in 2011 for the use in adult 50 years. the 13 serotypes account for about 91% of the pneumococcal isolates. PPSV23 contains purified capsular polysaccharide from each of the 23 capsular types of S. pneumoniae (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 8, 9N, 9V, 10A, 11A, 12F, 14, 15B, 17F, 18C, 19F, 19A, 20, 22F, 23F, and 33F. the vaccine should be shaken well to ensure a status of white homogeneous suspension. PPSV23 has limited efficacy in children 2 years, nonbacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia, otitis media, exacerbations of COPD, multiple myeloma, lymphoma, and chronic alcoholism. a cochrane review supports the recommendation to administer PPSV23 to prevent IPD in adults. PCV13 contains polysaccharide from 13 common capsular types (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F) serotypes account for about 91% of the pneumococcal isolates that cause serious infection in Saudi Arabia. the STS SCIPV pneumococcal vaccination recommendations are summarized below and in Tables 2, 3 and Figure 1. Recommended pneumococcal vaccination for adults and children >6 years sickle cell disease patients in Saudi Arabia according to age and state of health. the immune response to included serotypes is higher in the elderly who receive PCV followed by PPSV23. the vaccine should be received at age 2, 4, 6, and 12 months[87] [Evidence Category A] catch-up vaccination for healthy children In children 6 years, the incidence of the IPD, the immunological responses, and the safety results from various studies support the use for catch-up schedules utilizing PCV13. a randomized, double-blind study has reported a slightly lower pneumococcal serotype-specific antibody concentrations with PCV13 plus TIV compared with PCV13 alone or TIV alone. there are no data on the safety or efficacy of the coadministration of pneumococcal vaccine with other vaccines (tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, or zoster vaccine. vaccination for the Hajj and Umrah The Hajj and Umrah are the largest recurrent mass gatherings in the world when Muslims from different countries travel to the holy places in mecca and Madinah in Saudi Arabia. a large number of pilgrims coming to the Hajj have many of the underlying risk factors listed in Table 1 for pneumococcal disease. all persons at 50 year are recommended to receive combined vaccination with PCV13 and PPSV23 before the Hajj. a pregnant woman who has another risk factor for pneumococcal diseases might receive the vaccine during the second or third trimester of pregnancy. the annual prevalence of SCD was found to be almost constant in Saudi Arabia. this survey reported regional variability of SCD, with the highest prevalence (13.4%) in the eastern province. splenectomized persons should receive an additional dose of PPSV23 at least 8 weeks after the last PCV13. common reasons for splenectomy in saudi arabia are posttrauma (mainly due to motor vehicle accidents), hematological reasons, and portal hypertension. the last PPSV23 dose was received for individuals who require additional doses of PPSV23. it should be given no sooner than 8 weeks after PCV13 and at least 5 years after the most recent dose of PPSV23. conflicts of interest There are no conflicts of interest. only 7% of pilgrims received advice from their general practitioner about pneumococcal vaccination before the Hajj. only 14.2\u201328.7% of all pilgrims received the pneumococcal vaccine. 29\u201345.3% of the high-risk group received it. the annual prevalence of SCD was found to be almost constant in Saudi Arabia with an average rate of 4.5%: 4.2% carriers and 0.3% diseased. this is mainly related to the status of functional asplenia that presents in 80% of cases before the end of the 1st year of age. spleen has a major role in humoral immunity by clearing unopsonized bacteria. spleen has a major role in humoral immunity by functioning as a reservoir of mononuclear cells and produces antibodies mainly IgM following exposure to various antigens. for individuals who have not previously received either PCV13 or PPSV23, a single dose of PCV13 should be given, followed by a dose of PPSV23 at least 8 weeks later. financial support and sponsorship The Saudi Thoracic Society provided kind support for the Scientific Committee for Influenza and Pneumococcal Vaccinations."}
