{"summary": "Regulatory T-cells (T-regs) are associated with a tolerant immune state. however, T-cell subsets such as T-regs and IL-17 producing T-cells (Th-17) are not well studied. CMV-replication may also play a role in acute and chronic allograft injury/rejection, impaired long-term graft outcomes, and increased rates of bacterial and fungal infection. a decrease in CMV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells has been associated with progressive CMV replication. patients are typically monitored with molecular diagnostic tools to detect CMV-replication at an early stage. the kinetics of virus replication is only weakly associated with future outcomes such as progressive replication. novel immunological biomarkers, such as virus-specific T-cell responses might bridge this gap in our knowledge. clinical outcomes and follow-up data were collected for a minimum of six months post-enrollment. the decision to use anti-viral treatment and the type of therapy used was at the discretion of the treating physician. clinical signs and symptoms of relapse were assessed for a minimum of six months after the initial episode of disease. the slope of the decay curve was calculated based on this best-fit line. the more negative the decay slope, the more rapid the viral clearance. positive initial decay slopes indicate increasing viral-loads co-incident with the initiation of treatment. peptide vs. viral lysate was optimum for stimulation of CD4+ T cells. peptide pool optimally stimulated CD8+ T-cells. anti-CD3 was used as a positive control. Flow data were acquired using a BD FACSArrayTM Bioanalyzer System. results were analyzed using FCS Express version 3. 100,000 CD4+ T-cells were obtained per sample. clinical outcomes and follow-up data were collected for a minimum of six months post-enrollment. the decision to use anti-viral treatment and the type of therapy used was at the discretion of the treating physician. virologic relapse was defined as clearance of initial viremia followed by subsequent detection of virus on at least two separate occasions. the slope of the decay curve was calculated based on this best-fit line. positive initial decay slopes indicate increasing viral-loads co-incident with initiation of treatment. 1106 PBMCs were stimulated for 16 hours with CMV whole virus lysate derived from fibroblast cultures. a peptide pool optimally stimulated CD8+ T-cells. anti-CD3 was used as a positive control; media alone served as a negative control. IL-17 production was induced by 16 h stimulation with PMA (phorbol myristate acetate) and ionomycin at final concentrations of 1 g/mL and 500 ng/mL respectively at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 as previously published [23]. Flow data were acquired using a BD FACSArrayTM Bioanalyzer System. 100,000 CD4+ T-cells were obtained per sample. responses 0.2% CMV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells were considered to not be significantly different from the negative control. a total of 30 patients were enrolled including 20 patients with high-level viremia. median time to CMV-replication post-transplant was 151 days. no patient had biopsy proven acute rejection within a three-month period of follow-up after the initial detection of CMV. a higher percentage of D+/R patients in the progressive viremia group vs. the spontaneous clearance group (45% vs. 30%; p = 0.69) although this was not statistically significant. median viral-load at baseline was 4.6 log10 copies/mL (range 2.6\u20133.92 log10 copies/mL); median time to viral clearance was 7 days (range 7\u201318 days). one patient did not achieve complete clearance of viremia despite prolonged antiviral therapy. a cut-off of >1.4% CMV-specific CD4+ T-cells could predict spontaneous clearance of viremia with a 95% sensitivity and 60% specificity. a cut-off of >1.4% CMV-specific CD4+ T-cells could predict spontaneous clearance of viremia with a 95% sensitivity and 60% specificity. for Figure 2A, 2B, and 2C, the outcome of interest is spontaneous clearance of viremia; n = 30. the following three tests were analyzed: CMV-specific CD4+ T-cell response [Figure 2A and 2D], T-reg response [Figure 2B and 2E] and the ratio of the CMV-specific CD4+ T-cells to T-reg response [Figure 2C and 2F] patients with CMV-relapse showed significantly lower CMV-specific CD4+ T-cell counts one month after treatment discontinuation compared with patients without relapse. a cut-off of 1.5% CMV-specific CD4+ T-cells could predict relapse with 100% sensitivity and 61.5% specificity. ROC analysis revealed a cut-off of 2.5% T-regs which predicted spontaneous clearance of viremia with 50% sensitivity and 90% specificity. patients with relapsing CMV had significantly higher T-regs counts one month after stopping treatment compared with patients without relapse. ratio of CMV-specific CD4+ T-cells to T-regs (CD4+ T-cell: T-reg) above 0.4 could predict spontaneous clearance of viremia with 80% sensitivity and 90% specificity. no difference was observed in relation to relapsing CMV. previous anti-CMV prophylaxis had been administered to 73.3% of patients. no patient had biopsy proven acute rejection within a three-month period of follow-up after the initial detection of CMV. median viral-load at baseline was 2.77 log10 copies/mL (range 2.6\u20133.92 log10 copies/mL); median time to clearance was 7 days (range 7\u201318 days). one patient did not achieve complete clearance of viremia despite prolonged antiviral therapy. MV disease/progressive viremia had a significantly lower initial CMV-specific CD4+ T-cell frequency compared to patients with spontaneous clearance of viremia. a cut-off of >1.4% CMV-specific CD4+ T-cells could predict spontaneous clearance of viremia with a 95% sensitivity. the outcome of interest is spontaneous clearance of viremia; n = 30. the following three tests were analyzed: CMV-specific CD4+ T-cell response [Figure 2A and 2D], T-reg response [Figure 2B and 2E] and the ratio of the CMV-specific CD4+ T-cells to T-reg response [Figure 2C and 2F]. a cut-off of 1.5% CMV-specific CD4+ T-cells could predict relapse with 100% sensitivity and 61.5% specificity. patients without relapse showed a consistent increase in CMV-specific CD4+ T-cells over the follow-up period. treatment 2.10 (0.59\u20135.31) 2.18 (1.47\u20134.89) 0.552 +1 month 1.17 (0.59\u20134.80) 1.46 (0.76\u20132.79) 0.968 Patients with progressive viremia (n = 20) at treatment discontinuation and 1 month later were analyzed. ROC analysis revealed a cut-off of 2.5% T-regs which predicted spontaneous clearance of viremia. combination of CMV-specific CD4+ T-cells and T-regs significantly increased sensitivity and specificity to predict clearance and relapse. ratio of CMV-specific CD4+ T-cells to T-regs above 0.4 could predict spontaneous clearance of viremia with 80% sensitivity and 90% specificity. ROC curve analysis has been used to determine cutoffs for prediction of disease that have optimal sensitivity and specificity. the best predictor of both spontaneous clearance of viremia and relapse after treatment was the frequency ratio of CMV CD4+ T cells: T-reg. et al. determined that CMV-specific CD4+ T-cells above 0.25% were protective against CMV-replication. a value below 1.5% was associated with an increased risk of relapse. a positive correlation was also found between the frequency of CMV-specific CD4+ T-cell responses and the speed of viral decay. the role of T-regs in controlling CMV-specific immune responses was recently examined. in a mouse model of herpes simplex virus associated retinitis, T-regs were associated with progressive and more severe tissue invasive disease. IL-17-producing CD4+ T-cells have been detected in mice following infection with murine-CMV, herpes simplex virus, and influenza virus [15], [16], [17]. the generation of polarized Th-17 cells during viral infection has been correlated with high levels of IL-6 and may be influenced by transforming growth factor- (TGF-) MV-specific T-cells can be assessed by using interferon gamma as the predominant cytokine produced in response to specific stimulation. the functional impact of T-regs could primarily affect other markers such as interleukin 2 or T-cell proliferation.
