{"summary": "acute kidney injury patients often require temporary central venous catheters for dialysis, preferentially placed in the internal jugular or, less advocated, the subclavian vein. severe complications, for example, traumatic perforation of the cardiac or the vessel wall, are only rarely observed. extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is increasingly used in the intensive care unit. a 15.5f15 cm double lumen dialysis catheter was placed in the right internal jugular vein without complication. the patient received 1 g cyclophosphamide which he tolerated well. within minutes, the catheter was removed, allegedly not in supine position. in/sulbactam, clarithromycin and cephazolin deteriorated rapidly. the patient went into ventricular fibrillation after defibrillation. venoarterial ECMO treatment was initiated after cannulation of left femoral artery and right femoral vein. renal function deteriorated rapidly to anuric renal failure, and intermittent haemodialysis was initiated. the patient had been admitted to a smaller hospital 7 days earlier with deteriorating renal function due to IgA nephropathy. the patient became haemodynamically instable, and vasopressor therapy was initiated. the differential diagnosis included toxic pulmonary oedema after cyclophosphamide12 13. nL (normal range 4.5\u201311.0) with 81% (normal range 40\u201370) granulocytes, 11% monocytes, 7% lymphocytes (normal range 2\u20136%), no detectable eosinophilia, haemoglobin of 13.1 g/dL (normal range 13.5\u201317.5) and normal platelet count. al inspired oxygen 100%, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 23 cm H2O, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) 43 cm H2O, blood pressure at 90/50 mm Hg, and heart rate 110/min with vasopressor support. venoarterial ECMO treatment was initiated after cannulation of left femoral artery. pulmonary oedema is highly unlikely with IgA. pulmonary manifestation of necrotising glomerulonephritis is highly unlikely. anti-GBM antibodies were negative, ruling out Goodpasture's syndrome. the typical presentation of respiratory failure with allergic reactions would be either obstructive (acute asthma) or restrictive with reduced diffusion capacity (allergic alveolitis) no eosinophilia could be detected in the peripheral blood. the patient presented with a sudden onset and rapidly progressive pulmonary oedema with respiratory and circulatory failure. the initial differential diagnosis included toxic or infectious pulmonary oedema, toxic or infectious cardiomyopathy, and sepsis. hage would have been noted during the ultrasound examination performed during central line insertion, making it most likely that severe oedema caused the neck swelling. echocardiography showed normal size and function of the left and right ventricle and no signs of right ventricular pressure overload or underfilling of the left ventricle. inflammatory states associated with systemic air embolism have been described in animal models. it has been postulated that the disruption of microvascular flow by microscopic air bubbles cause agglomeration of polymorphonuclear leucocytes and platelet aggregation in the pulmonary capillaries. this mechanism can trigger the cascade of cytokines thought to be causative agents of systemic inflammatory response syndrome. the rapid recovery is typical of air-induced pulmonary injury. treatment should include the use of oxygen and cardiorespiratory mechanical support if necessary. air embolism of pulmonary arteries usually manifests with dyspnoea, tachypnoea, coughing or syncope. pulmonary air embolism should also be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute pulmonary oedema."}
