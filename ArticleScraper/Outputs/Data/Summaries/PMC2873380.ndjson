{"summary": "pediatric mid-turbinate nasal flocked swabs are as effective as traditional methods [13-15], and simple enough to be used by adult patients and the parents of children [13,16]. the study involved all of the children aged between six months and five years who attended the Emergency Department of the University of Milan because of signs and symptoms of respiratory disease between 1 January 2008 and 28 February 2008. 750CS01 and those for older children (code 56380CS01) have a collar that is large enough to prevent further insertion when it reaches the nostril. the pediatrician and a parent each inserted a swab gently up to its collar and rotated it three times before placing it in viral transport medium to be delivered to the laboratory within three hours. influenza A and B RNA were quantified relatively; the criterion for a positive reaction was a cycle threshold (CT) of 40 cycles. the findings were compared using SAS version 9.1 software (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina) influenza virus detection rates were similar in the samples collected using the two methods. the sensitivity and specificity of the parental collections were respectively 89.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 77.8-100%) and 97.7% (95% CI: 95.5-100%) the positive and negative predictive values were respectively 86.2% (95% CI: 73.7-95.1%) and 98.2% (95% CI: 96.4-100%). the number of influenza-positive nasal swabs and the CT values were similar in the samples collected by the pediatrician and parents. the direct involvement of parents significantly increased the patient's acceptance of the procedure and thus simplified collection. if the child is included in an epidemiological survey, parental collection reduces the risk of losing the sample when respiratory episodes occur. sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values were high. sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values were high. authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
