{"summary": "arenaviruses are a family of enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses that are maintained primarily in rodents in nature1-3. these viruses typically establish an asymptomatic, persistent infection in rodent reservoirs1,2 they can cause severe disease in humans3. the new world Junin virus (JUNV)4 and the Old World Lassa virus5 are the etiologic agents of Argentine hemorrhagic fever in south America and Lassa fever in africa GP-encoded fusion peptide inserts into the endosome, initiating fusion between the viral and endosomal membranes. successful fusion results in the release of the virion-packaged vRNAs into the cytoplasm. new particles assemble and bud from the infected cell to complete the life cycle18. the assay can be adapted to measure virion endocytosis and release of virus genome into the cytoplasm following fusion. it is critical that all reagents and equipment are free of amplified DNA containing the qPCR target sequence and appropriate controls are in place to detect such contamination. JUNV C#1 is a biosafety level (BSL)-2-rated pathogen. the work described for this section must be carried out using appropriate BSL-2 practices31. use a minimal medium containing PBS with a reduced serum concentration (2%) and an appropriate buffer to establish whether serum may cause interference with virus attachment. this assay is capable of detecting attachment using as few as 20 PFU. each virus sample will be inoculated onto duplicate wells in a volume of 50 l per well. if the addition of 2,000 PFUs of virus per well is desired, dilute 4,800 PFUs into a total volume of 120 l of complete DMEM. l of ice cold PBS (phosphate buffered saline) pH 7.4. aspirate the virus inoculum and wash each well 3 times with 200 l of ice-cold PBS. follow the \"purification of total RNA from animal cells using spin technology protocol\" qRT-PCR Measurement of Viral Genome To convert JUNV C#1 S segment RNA into cDNA for subsequent qPCR, subject the viral RNA (generated in step 3.1.4) to RT in a total volume of 50 l. RT primer listed here is specific for only the S segment vRNA, but not the vcRNA, NP mRNA, or GP mRNA. mix the RT master mix and then aliquot 40 l into individual 0.2 ml PCR tubes. add 10 l of viral RNA to each tube. the forward primer reported here differs by 1 nt from the originally reported primer sequence38, which targets the virulent JUNV strain Romero. Gently mix the solution and then add 20 l to each qPCR well. the pCAGGS-JUNV C#1 NP plasmid used here has a MW of 4.2 x 106. once the MW of the plasmid has been determined, calculate how many copies per l are present. 500 ml of complete DMEM contain 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 1% HEPES buffer solution. this reagent can be stored at 4 \u00b0C for months. test each virus sample in either duplicate or triplicate wells. use of personal protective equipment (e.g. eye protection, laboratory coat, double gloves), a class II biosafety cabinet. use a minimal medium containing PBS with a reduced serum concentration (2%) and an appropriate buffer to establish whether serum may cause interference with virus attachment. hTfR1 or the monocolonal antibody ch128.1, which is specific for hTfR1, could also be considered as they are known to block entry of JUNV into cells13,36. pretreatment of cells with free mannose14 or incubation of particles with JUNV-specific neutralizing antibodies37 can inhibit virus entry. follow the \"purification of total RNA from animal cells using spin technology protocol\" lyse the cells as directed in step 1B by adding 350 l of lysis buffer RLT directly to each well. transfer the resulting cell lysate to the kit column. RT primer S 2098- to 2075- is complementary to the NP region of the S segment genomic RNA, 5 l of 10X PCR buffer II, 11 l of a 25 mM MgCl2 solution, 1.25 l (62.5 Units) of RT enzyme, 1 l (0.4 Units) of RNase inhibitor, and 10 l of a 500 M stock of dNTPs. include a known-positive viral RNA sample to the full master mix to verify the quality of the RT reagents. perform qPCR in a total volume of 25 l. the qPCR assay can only provide quantitation for values that fall within the range of the standard curve. include the following quantities of plasmid (in triplicate wells): 5, 50, 5 x 103, 5 x 105, and 5 x 107 copies per well. MW of the plasmid has been determined, calculate how many copies per l are present in the stock plasmid solution. first calculate the total g of plasmid in the solution, then convert this to moles of plasmid. if 69 g of plasmid are contained in 300 l of water, then 6.9 x 10-5 g of plasmid. qRT-PCR assay can detect viral attachment events using as few as 20 or as many as 2 x 106 PFU. as shown in Figure 4, it is possible to modify the protocol to measure viral attachment, but also the rate of amplification of the genome contained in the incoming viral particles over time. the primer-probe set was tested for its ability to accurately measure known quantities (5, 16.6, 50, 5 x 103, 5 x 105, or 5 x 107 copies) of a DNA standard control plasmid encoding the target sequence. depicted are the amplification plots (A) and standard curve fit lines (B). strict pre-PCR technique must be employed to detect amplified DNA containing the qPCR target sequence. the quantity of cells collected for RNA extraction must not exceed the RNA binding capacity of the RNA purification filter. arenavirus RNA, whether extracted from cells or virions, can be nonspecifically primed to form cDNA during the RT in the absence of a virus-specific RT primer. copy numbers detected using a vRNA-specific RT primer do not reflect just the vRNA species targeted by the RT primer. qPCR-based method described here requires as little as 20 PFU. cell-attachment assay described can be modified to measure additional stages of viral entry including viral particle endocytosis. the same steps of the attachment protocol would be followed through step 2.5, which is attachment of particles to cells at 4 \u00b0C. cells would then be warmed to allow viral particles to be endocytosed, followed by treatment with a protease to strip any externally-bound virions. authors declare that they have no competing financial interests."}
