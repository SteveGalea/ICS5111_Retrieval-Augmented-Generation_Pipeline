{"summary": "Ang II stimulates cardiac myofibroblast transdifferentiation leading to fibrosis. Ang II also stimulates proliferation, invasion and secretion of extracellular matrix proteins. a combination of ACE inhibitors and AT1R blockers has been shown to be more effective than either alone. ACE2 deletion murine models have a significantly higher mortality rate post-MI than wild-type mice. mortality was associated with enhanced adverse ventricular remodelling following MI [10], a state which was reversed by the use of an AT1R blocker. a mounting body of evidence is forming in support of a cardioprotective role for ACE2 through the metabolism of Ang II [10], [11], but also through the direct action of Ang-(1-7) via its own receptor, Mas ACE2 binds integrin 1 (ITGB1) in the failing human heart [25] adds another dimension to the role of the ACE family in cardiac homeostasis. ACE2 is a family of heterodimeric cell surface receptors, which link extracellular matrix proteins with the intracellular cytoskeleton. ACE2 regulates integrin induced cell signalling via modulation of the phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Akt expression levels. integrin binding domain was identified in the ectodomain of ACE2. ACE2 (green) and ITGB1 (red) are located together (yellow) on the cell membrane of HEK-ACE2 cells. immunoprecipitation was performed on HEK cells over-expressing ACE2 (HEK-ACE2 cells) ACE and ACE2 bind integrins independently of an RGD sequence. ACE does bind ITGB1 and ACE also bind ITGA5 similarly. cross-linked immunoprecipitation was repeated in Huh7 cells. immunoprecipitation of ACE2 with ITGB1 was performed as before. cell monolayers were cross-linked using DTBP before lysis and immunoprecipitation as before. -carbon trace of the inhibitor bound structures looking into the active site cleft. the coordinating active site residues stabilising the inhibitor, Mln-4760. a significant difference was seen between the adhesion of Huh7 cells to ACE2-expressing cells compared with non ACE2-expressing cells. cellular expression of ACE2 abolished the decrease mediated by pre-incubation with an RGD peptide. ACE2 affects cellular adhesion in vitro. cellular expression of ACE2 increases cell adhesion independent of RGD motif. cells were treated as before or the HEK-ACE2 cells were pre-incubated with RGD peptide before Huh7 cell addition. the number of cells which had adhered was quantified by fluorescent emission. cells were plated and allowed to adhere (2.5 h at 37\u00b0C) after incubation unadhered cells were washed off. cell adhesion is comparable between ACE and ACE2. experiments were performed to determine if ACE2 could elicit integrin signalling. Huh7 cells (A) or CF cells (B) were starved for 12 hours, then treated in the presence or absence of sACE2 at concentration indicated for 20 min. treatment with sACE2 increases cellular Akt expression. ACE2 binds Integrin 1 A typical integrin binding motif is the tripeptide sequence RGD. bioinformatic analysis was used to compare the protein sequences of ACE and ACE2. ACE2 protein sequence conservation surrounding and including proposed integrin binding site. ACE2 (green) and ITGB1 (red) are located together (yellow) on the cell membrane of HEK-ACE2 cells. immunoprecipitation was performed on HEK cells over-expressing ACE2 (HEK-ACE2 cells) ACE lacks the RGD motif present in the extracellular domain of ACE2. immunoprecipitation revealed that ACE does bind ITGB1. ACE also binds ITGA5 similarly. the RGD motif is inaccessible in ACE2 We utilised molecular modelling to investigate the apparent functional redundancy of the motif in integrin binding. however, the space filling model revealed that the aspartate residue of the RGD motif faces into the active site cleft. the inhibitor bound structures of ACE and ACE2 are shown as ball and stick representation and the inhibitor, Captopril, illustrating the location of the substrates in the active site cleft. ACE2 can act as a cell adhesion substrate. a significant difference was seen between the adhesion of Huh7 cells to ACE2-expressing cells compared with non ACE2-expressing cells. cellular expression of ACE2 abolished the decrease mediated by pre-incubation with an RGD peptide. cellular expression of tACE does not affect cell adhesion. cells were treated as before, the number of cells which had adhered was quantified by fluorescent emission. to examine the physiological importance of the adhesion properties of ACE2 and ACE, adhesion assays were performed using primary human cardiac myofibroblast cells. cells were stimulated with the ectodomain of ACE2. the levels of phosphorylated FAK in the presence and absence of sACE2 were quantified by ELISA. treatment with sACE2 increases cellular Akt expression. cells were treated as above with either: sACE2, ACE, or Ang-(1-7), at the concentration and for the length of time indicated. sACE2 does not affect NF-B levels. both ACE and ACE2 exerted on cell models are physiologically relevant to the diseased human heart. ACE2 expression has consistently been seen to be up-regulated in the peri-infarct area after MI [10], [20], [33] and in end stage heart failure [34] indicative of a role in injury. the aspartate residue is positioned facing the active site cleft of the protein and as such is not available to bind into the integrin binding pocket. prothrombin, like ACE2, contains a partially buried RGD motif. the ability of prothrombin to bind integrin v3 is key to its biological activity. neither ACE nor ACE2 contain an ECD motif. integrin binding to ACE2 is essential for the role of ACE2 as a cellular anchor. the presence of ACE2 on the cell surface partially removed the requirement of RGD-interactions. sACE2 is a critical signalling component associated with areas of substratum adhesion. treatment with sACE2 increases levels of Akt expression, a pro-survival, pro-proliferative protein. however, changes in the level of phosphorylated Akt were also seen. cell culture reagents were purchased from Lonza (Slough, UK) cell Extraction Buffer and Elisa kit were purchased from Invitrogen (Paisley, UK) along with lipofectamine and BCECF reagent (2\u20327\u2032-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and6)-carboxyfluorescein) Roche (Welwyn, UK) supplied protease inhibitor tablets.
