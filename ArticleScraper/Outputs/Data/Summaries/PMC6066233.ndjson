{"summary": "oral plant vaccine-encoding Per a 2 clone-996 or its hypoallergenic clone-372 could exert a prophylactic role in Per a 2-sensitized mice. cDNAs coding Per a 2\u2013996 and Per a 2\u2013372 were inserted into TuMV vector and expressed in Chinese cabbage. the prevalence of American cockroach allergy as determined by skin test ranges from 4057% in Taiwan [1, 5], 4460% in Thailand [6], 5579% in Brazil [7], and 53% in India [8]. previous studies have characterized 12 groups of allergenic components, namely Per a 112, from P. americana [9\u201312]. cockroach immunotherapy with plant-expressed allergen vaccine has yet to be studied. TuMV belongs to the genus Potyvirus, one of the most important groups of positive sense ssRNA plant viruses infecting a vast array of crops worldwide. the primers, 5\u2019 Per a 2-372Nco (5\u2019CAACCATGGTGCCTGTATCAAATAATAACGTGG 3\u2019) were annealed at positions nt 262 and 1056 of Per a 2, respectively. the amplified fragments were cloned to NcoI/NheI-digested p35S-TuMVCPGFP to create the recombinant clones pTuMV-Per a 2\u2013 six-week-old female BALB/c mice were purchased from the National Laboratory Animal Center, Taiwan. all animal experiments were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Taichung Veterans General Hospital. mice received a total of 21 days intragastrical administration of plant extracts containing 1 g of Per a 2\u2013996 or -372. one week after the final feeding, mice received intranasal (IN) challenge with rPer a 2 on three consecutive days. airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) was performed on day 62 and all mice were sacrificed on day 63. mice were placed in the main chamber and challenged with aerosolized methacholine at concentrations of 6.25\u201350 mg/ml generated by a nebulizer. the degree of bronchoconstriction was measured and averaged for 3 minutes after each nebulization. the lungs were removed and processed for routine histologic analysis. the culture supernatants were collected at each time interval and stored at -20\u00b0C until use in the cytokine assay. the levels of IL-13, IL-10, and interferon (IFN)- in the culture supernatants were measured with murine ELISA development kits.

2. the amplified fragments were cloned to p35S-TuMVCPGFP. recombinant protein quantification of TuMV-Per a 2\u2013996 and 372 were performed by densitometric analysis using image analysis software. comparing to E.coli-derived rPer a 2 and rPer a 2\u2013372 as the standard, respectively. all animal experiments were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Taichung Veterans General Hospital. airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) was assessed on day 62. all mice were sacrificed on day 63 and spleen, blood, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung were collected. mice received 21 days intragastrical administration of plant extracts containing 1 g of Per a 2\u2013996 or -372. horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (1:4,000) was added for 1 hour. the plates were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG1 or IgG2a (1:1000) for 2 hours at room temperature and developed by adding ABTS as above. the optical density was analyzed on a Sunrise Absorbance Reader (TECAN, Austria) at 415 nm. cytokine production Splenocytes were cultured in 24-well plates at a concentration of 1106 cells/ml and stimulated with specific allergens for each group at 37\u00b0C for 2\u20135 days. the levels of IL-13, IL-10, and interferon (IFN)- in the culture supernatants were measured with murine ELISA development kits (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ) sequences of gene-specific primers used in real-time PCR. able was recorded as the cycle threshold. pTuMV-Per a 2\u2013996 and pTuMV-Per a 2\u2013372 by the TuMV vector. symptoms developed in local lesion host of Chenopodium quinoa and systemic host Brassica chinensis L. are shown in Fig 2B. there was a statistically significant correlation between recombinant proteins and intensity levels of the standard bands. the levels of TuMV-expressed Per a 2\u2013996 and 372 were 2.4 and 1.21 mg per gram of extracted plant total protein, respectively. the levels of TuMV-expressed Per a 2 were 2.4 and 1.21 mg per gram of extracted plant total protein, respectively. the levels of specific IgE antibodies in mice of Per a 2-996- and Per a 2-372-treated groups were significantly lower than those in the sham group on week 9. however, there were no significant differences in the levels of IgG1 and IgG2a among any of the four groups. this result suggests that oral administration of cockroach allergen-encoding plant vaccine prevented the development of cockroach allergen-specific IgE in mice exposed to cockroach allergens oral administration of plant vaccine attenuated airway hyperresponsiveness in rPer a 2-challenged mice. cytokine mRNA levels of splenocytes from each group were significantly elevated in the Per a 2\u2013372 group compared with that of either the sham group or vector alone group. data are expressed as mean of increasing fold SEM (n = 5\u20136 per group) the statistical significance of differences between groups was assessed by the Dunnett\u2019s test. pTuMV-Per a 2\u2013996 and pTuMV-Per a 2\u2013372 by the TuMV vector. symptoms developed in the local lesion host of Chenopodium quinoa and systemic host Brassica chinensis L. the

allergens rPer a 2-challenged mice were incubated with rPer a 2 for 3 days. the cytokine mRNA expression in response to rPer a 2 was determined by real-time PCR. splenocytes from each group were incubated with rPer a 2 for 3 days. data are expressed as mean of increasing fold SEM (n = 5\u20136 per group) the statistical significance of differences between groups was assessed by the

Th2 cytokines. the cockroach allergen-encoding cabbage up-regulate the mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines from the innate immune cells IL-6 and TNF-alpha. studies targeting IgE, IL-2, IL4R-alpha, IL-5, and IL-13 showed some efficacy, but those targeting IL-6 did not show convincing effectiveness. plant encoding hypoallergen Per a 2\u2013372 consistently gave better effects in terms of inhibition of development of allergen-specific IgE production, airway hyperresponsiveness, type 2 cytokine production, as well as inhibition of lung inflammation.
