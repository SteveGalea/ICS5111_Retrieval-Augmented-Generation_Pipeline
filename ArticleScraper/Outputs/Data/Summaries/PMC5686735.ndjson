{"summary": "MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an enveloped, positive-sense single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) virus classified as belonging to the Betacoronavirus genus of the Coronaviridae family. more than 1,700 cases spanning 27 different countries, with an overall case fatality rate of just over 35%. only one PLP is encoded, papain-like protease (PLpro) the PLpro and 3C-like protease are responsible for cleaving Nsp1 to Nsp3 and Nsp4 to Nsp16. intriguingly, coV PLpros have additional roles beyond simply cleaving Nsp1 to Nsp3 to promote viral replication (11) direct disruption of PLpro's deubiquitinase and deISGylase proteolytic activities together was shown to remove antagonism of the IFN-I response in part due to suppression of Ub-dependent mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS)-mediated signaling. a lack of structural information pertaining to how MERS-CoV PLpro accommodates ISG15s limited their ability to delineate whether the MERS-CoV PLpro's deubiquitinase, deISGylase, or both activities were critical for effective IFN-I antagonism by MERS-CoV or other CoV PLPs (17). however, no structures illuminating the interface of MERS-CoV and ISG15s have similarly been e c TS (kJ/mol)d MERS-CoV PLpro Human ISG15e 0.785 0.027 59.30 12.7 11.34 0.268 24.15 12.80 C-human ISG15f 0.721 0.025 27.06 3.04 15.22 0.521 26.08 10.87 Mono-Ubf 0.692 0.011 9.56 0.233 21.20 0.141 6.85 14.30 SARS-CoV PLpro Human ISG15e 0.9 MERS-CoV PLpro engages human ISG15 through its C-terminal domain (ChISG15) amino acid sites within the MERS-CoV and hISG15 interface were probed to gain insight into explicit interactions driving the binding event. this has resulted in the generation of altered MERS-CoV PLpros lacking appreciable biochemical deISGylase activity while still retaining wild-type (WT) deubiquitinase and peptide cat hISG15 has weaker affinity and a different thermodynamic profile than full-length hISG15. hISG15 binding event was driven by a combination of favorable entropic and enthalpic components with similar ratios. a simpler explanation may be that the N-terminal domain does not play as significant a role for MERS-CoV PLpro. ITC binding isotherm with the raw heat (top panel) and integrated heats of injection (bottom panel) shown for interaction between MERS-CoV PLpro and ChISG15. X-ray structure of the MERS-CoV PLpro-ChISG15 complex was initially determined to 2.7 in the P43 space group by collecting single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) data. for the parametera Zn-SAD (PDB 5W8T) Native (PDB 5W8U) Data collection Space group P43 P43 Wavelength () 1.2837 1 Cell dimensions a, b, c ( 86.3, 86.3, 223.6 86.4, 86.4, 224.1,, (\u00b0) 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90 Resolution () 50.00\u20132.76 (2.81\u20132.76) 50.00\u20132.41 (2.45\u20132.41) Rmerge the PLpro is shown in gold, and ChISG15 is shown in teal. the structural domains of the MERS-CoV PLpro consist of the fingers (white), palm (lavender), thumb (green) and Ubl (pink) Domains. the insertion of ChISG15's Lys129 side chain into a pocket appears to mirror the favorable entropic and enthalpic thermodynamic forces observed when the ISG15 product binds to the protease via ITC. comparison of the MERS-CoV PLpro's accommodation of ChISG15 within its Ub binding motif to that of Ub highlights the likely dynamic nature of PLpros' engagement of their substrates. the MERS-CoV in complex with ChISG15 is colored as described in Fig. 3A. the zinc finger is shown as a black sphere. the zinc atom is shown as a black sphere. the kcat values of MERS-CoV PLpro for ISG15 and Ub are comparable. these changes do not appear to imply that there is a substantial difference in catalysis due to these differences. the remaining distance between the N-terminal domain of hISG15 and SARS-CoV PLpro's ridgeline helix residues closes (19) the movement of the Zn fingers in the SARS-CoV PLpro would require movement of the bound ChISG15 domain. closed conformation allows for the interaction with the top of the thumb domain and the helix connecting the Ubl domain by the ChISG15. the hydrophobic interaction between the Pro224 and Phe149 of the ChISG15 is lost in the MERS-CoV complex due to the replacement with a valine, which is not close enough to make an interaction. a minor improvement of MERS-CoV PLpro for northern shrew ISG15 was observed. a faint cleavage product was observed at the 30-min mark. however, this improvement was very minor, suggesting additional differences between northern shrew and human ISG15s may also play a factor in the species specificity of MERS-CoV PLpro. the peptide represents the consensus sequence for both Ub and ISG15. it is used as a control to ensure that intrinsic catalytic activity is not significantly impacted. the mutations failed to reduce deISGylase activity, implying that residues in the Ubl could play a role in some interactions. 11 mutations were designed for their potential to selectively disrupt the interface between MERS-CoV PLpro and hISG15 without appreciably impacting deubiquitinase and peptidase activities. mutants shown in green have reduced activity toward ISG15-AMC, the mutant shown in magenta showed little change in activity. four of these mutations, V225D, V225A, Q227A, and R232V, had no significant impact on any activity. however, one mutation, V225P, unexpectedly increased activity toward both Ub-AMC and ISG15-AMC. PLpro's Arg234 and hISG15's Glu127 boosted protease activity toward Ub-AMC. the removal of the charged residue leaves a predominantly hydrophobic surface. the most successful mutations to remove deISGylase activity occurred at positions 176 and 210. the effect of the V210D mutation is a reduction of deISGylase activity to 4%. the effect of the mutation is a reduction of deISGylase activity to 4%. however, no complete cleavage of pro-hISG15 is observed for K176E after 60 min. the mutants possessed a Km of 3.17 0.366 M and kcat of 12.22 0.430 M1 min1 for Ub. the mutant V210D had a 3-fold elevated Km of 10.04 2.33, echoing the weaker binding of Ub observed on the ITC. however, it also possessed a 3-fold higher kcat of 29.44 2.40 M1 min1. V210D's kcat/Km of 0.23 0.050 M1 min1 and K176E's kcat/Km of 0.74 0.170 M1 min1 were more reflective of the kcat/Km of 0.3 0.1 reported for the hISG15 substrate. a similar kcat/Km of 0.33 0.066 M1 min1 was observed for a crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever viral ovarian tumor domain ( ITC data, as well as other mutational data, supported the idea that this interaction extends to the N-terminal domain of ISG15 for SARS-CoV PLpro (19, 20). Specifically, the C-terminal domain of hISG15 (ChISG15) was found to have weaker affinity and a different thermodynamic profile than full-length hISG15. a simpler explanation may be that the N-terminal domain of hISG15 does not play as significant a role for MERS-CoV PLpro as it does for SAR-CoV PLpro. this explanation would also imply that the C-terminal domain of hISG15 plays the dominant role in forming favorable interactions with MERS CoV PLpro. the protease's Ub-like fold of ChISG15 was found in close proximity to the fingers and palm domains of MERS-CoV PLpro. the ub-like fold of ChISG15 was found in close proximity to the fingers and palm domains of MERS-CoV PLpro. the PLpro is shown in gold, and ChISG15 is shown in teal. the structural domains of MERS-CoV PLpro consist of the fingers (white), palm (lavender), thumb (green) and Ubl (pink) Domains. ase is made up of interactions between his171 and Arg168 of the MERS-CoV PLpro and ChISG15 residues Pro130 and Trp123. the other is comprised of the insertion of ChISG15's Lys129 side chain into a pocket generated by the carbonyl groups of the PLpro's Lys205 and Cys208. this differs from the open state of the protease (PDB 4RF1) where the Zn fingers are found peeled away from Ub, limiting the protease's interaction with the substrate. the zinc atom is shown as a black sphere. lone exception is Arg155, whose long flexible side chain forms hydrostatic interactions with the carbonyl of Val276 of the protease instead of Pro163. this change appears to have minimal impact on the backbone, suggesting that the differences in orientation of ISG15 versus Ub within the UIM are likely the primary driver of the backbone deviations. the latter open state of MERS-CoV PLpro-Ub is more representative of the recently elucidated SARS-CoV PLpro-ChISG15 structure. this could indicate that, much like PLpro's interaction with Ub, more than one bound state of hISG15 in a PLpro may also exist. for the SARS-CoV PLpro, this may offer an explanation of how the remaining distance found in current models would require movement of the bound Ch two of the hydrophobic interactions that drive the MERS-CoV PLpro's interaction with the ChISG15 are absent from the SARS-CoV PLpro and ChISG15 complex due to the more closed conformation of the zinc finger of the MERS-CoV PLpro. this conformation allows for one of the loops that coordinate the zinc to come in closer proximity to the ChISG15, creating a large hydrophobic seam. the lack of efficacy toward northern tree shrew ISG15 may originate from differences between northern tree shrew ISG15 and hISG15 at positions 144 and 145. a minor improvement of MERS-CoV PLpro for northern shrew ISG15 was observed. a faint cleavage product was observed at the 30-min mark, in line with greater cleavage at the 60-min mark. the activity of wild-type MERS-CoV PLpro as well as MERS-CoV PLpro containing disruptive mutations at those sites was assessed using three substrates. these were Ub-AMC, ISG15-AMC, and the small peptide Z-RLRGG-AMC, which are designed utilizing the 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) leaving group. mutants with attenuated deISGylase activity were sought. 11 mutations were designed for their potential to selectively disrupt the interface between MERS-CoV PLpro and hISG15 without appreciably impacting deubiquitinase and peptidase activities. close-up interactions of mutants that specifically reduce activity toward ISG15-AMC. four of these mutations, V225D, V225A, Q227A, and R232V, had no substantial impact on any activity. however, one mutation unexpectedly increased activity toward both Ub-AMC and ISG15-AMC. mutation was initially designed to disrupt salt bridge interactions between PLpro's Arg234 and hISG15's Glu127. this alteration inadvertently boosted protease activity toward Ub-AMC. the removal of the charged residue leaves a predominantly hydrophobic surface. the introduction of aspartic acid was designed to take advantage of the differences at Ub's Arg42, Ile44, and Gln49 and hISG15's Trp123, Thr125, and Pro130 residues. there was a concern that this might also disrupt the nearby hydrophobic path involving Ub's Ile44. however, the deubiquitinase activity remains near wild-type levels, suggesting either that this does not occur or that perhaps any disruption the mutant exhibited weaker binding to Ub, with a KD of 200.50 7.77 M, that could be the source of the 20% reduction of deubiquitinase activity observed for V210D. the mutant had a 3-fold elevated Km of 10.04 2.33, echoing the weaker binding of Ub observed on the ITC.

ITC measurements of MERS-CoV PLpros with ChISG15 or Ub were performed using a previously described protocol (23). both the protease and substrate were dialyzed into 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, and 0.1 mM ZnCl2 overnight at 4\u00b0C. the mixture was dialyzed in 250 mM NaCl, 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.0), 2 mM DTT, and 0.1 mM ZnCl2 overnight with thrombin to cleave a 6His tag. the thrombin-cleaved complex was further purified by size exclusion chromatography using a superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA) final optimized condition consisted of 200 mM CaCl2, 100 mM NaO2C2H3 (pH 4.6) and 28% (vol/vol) MPD. crystals of MERS-CoV PLpro-ChISG15 were soaked in mother liquor. the resultant plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli NEB-5 cells by heat shock.
