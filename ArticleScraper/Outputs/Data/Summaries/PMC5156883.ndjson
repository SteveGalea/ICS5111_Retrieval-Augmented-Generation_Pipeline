{"summary": "MP pneumonia (MPP) causes up to 40% of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children. this is even higher ratio during epidemics. the pathophysiology of MP infection is complex. et al., 2004; Ren et al., 2004; Agranoff et al., 2006; Hodgetts et al., 2007); cancer (Engwegen et al., 2006); and vascular disease (Pinet et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2008; Hong et al., 2009). proteins identified that could distinguish MPP from HC and IDC were further validated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent as protein extraction Human plasma with removal of IgG, IgA, albumin, antitrypsin, haptoglobin, and transferrin were mixed together for each group. each mixed sample was suspended with phosphate buffered saline (PBS, 50 L), centrifuged at 10,000 g for 30 min in 4\u00b0C. each sample was mixed with DTT (5 L, 1 mol/L) at 37\u00b0C for 60 min, diluted with IAA (20 L cell phase A consisted of HPLC-grade water containing 0.1% formic acid. phase B consisted of 84% HPLC-grade acetonitrile (ACN) containing 0.1% FA. each LC-MS/MS analysis was repeated three times to reduce technical variation. signaling pathway analysis was performed using tools from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome (KEGG) database. ELISA kits were used to measure changes in plasma protein levels in the MPP (n = 85), HC (n = 95) and CFLAR (Dldevelop) groups. a total of 20 children hospitalized with a final diagnosis of MPP confirmed using PCR and ELISA were enrolled. seventeen other children defined as IDC were collected accordingly and had symptoms including respiratory symptoms and negative MPP immunoglobulin M (1:80) to exclude MPP. each mixed sample was centrifuged at 10,000 g for 30 min in 4\u00b0C. proteins were extracted by ultrasonic sonication and precipitated with trichloroacetic acid for 30 min on ice. each sample was mixed with DTT (5 L, 1 mol/L) at 37\u00b0C for 60 min, diluted with IAA (20 L, 1 mol/L) for 60 min in the dark. 0.1% formic acid (FA) and phase B consisted of 84% HPLC-grade acetonitrile (ACN) containing 0.1% FA. each LC-MS/MS analysis was repeated three times to reduce technical variation. ELISA kits were used to measure changes in plasma protein levels in the MPP (n = 85), HC (n = 95) and IDC (n = 75) groups. a network model of protein interactions according to known protein-protein interactions was made using STRING 9.05. the participants in this study will not receive direct benefits from the proposed research. the benefits could be a potentially less expensive and faster way to diagnose a serious disease and begin treatment earlier than current diagnostic methods. Label-free quantitative proteomics coupled with LC-MS/MS analysis were used to compare samples from the three groups (MPP, HC, and IDC) 282 and 76 proteins differed between the MPP group (>2- or 0.5-fold) and the HC group and IDC group, respectively.

APOC1, APOC1, and CFLAR had a relatively high AUC of 0.882. SERPINA3 and CFLAR had lower AUC-values of 0.866, 0.698, and 0.578 when MPP was compared with HC plus IDC. we calculated the sensitivities and specificities of combinations of two or three selected proteins for differentiation between MPP and HC, IDC, or HC + IDC. the results showed that APOC1 alone was the best choice in children. the causative agents included Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 2), Influenza B virus (n = 3), Escherichia coli (n = 3), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (n = 2), Haemophilus (n = 3), and Epstein-Barr virus (n = 4). no significant differences in age or gender were identified among these three groups. 18 proteins were down-regulated (0.5-fold) and 9 proteins were up-regulated (>2-fold) in the MPP group compared with the HC group. 21 proteins were down-regulated (0.5-fold) and 6 proteins were up-regulated (>2-fold) in the MPP group compared with the HC group. zinc finger protein 15 isoform 1 PRDM15 P57071 169.2 9.6 123.4 0.233 0.439 gi|31791053 Zinc finger protein 804B ZNF804B A4D1E1 152.5 9.8 116.8 0.178 0.189 gi|4885583 rho-associated protein kinase 1 ROCK1 Q13464 158.1 5.6 113.3 2.941 0.431 gi|572882727 8TEQ6 168.4 6.2 73.6 0.439 0.526 gi|4502157 Apolipoprotein C-I precursor APOC1 P02654 9.3 9.3 73.5 2.083 2.273 gi|302129652 Annexin A6 isoform 2 ANXA6 P08133 72.4 5.3 71.3 0.154 0.103 gi|338753408 Transcription factor IIIB 90 kDa subunit isoform this isoform b ATXN7L3 Q14CW9 38.6 6.8 36.6 0.278 0.407 gi|222352127 Protein sidekick-2 precursor SDK2 Q58EX2 239.2 6.6 85.3 0.483 0.546 gi|378925630 Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 17-like protein 10 USP17L10 C9JJH3 59.8 9.4 50.5 0.483 the majority of proteins in the CC category had a cellular part and organelle distribution. the 27 proteins in the BP category were mainly related to binding, catalysis, enzyme regulator, molecular transducer, transcription regulator, and transporter. the 27 proteins in the BP category were mainly related to binding, catalysis, enzyme regulator, molecular transducer, transcription regulator, and transporter. this analysis indicated that the identified proteins involved in these GO categories might have the most important roles in the MP infection process. LAR levels were observed among all three groups and their ratios were consistent with the trends of the proteomic results. the level of APOC1 protein in MPP was markedly increased when compared with that in HC or IDC. however, significantly lower levels of the two proteins were observed in the MPP group compared with that in HC or IDC. ROC curves calculated at optimal cutoff for SERPINA3, APOC1 and CFLAR. the results showed that APOC1 alone was the best choice in children. proteins MPP vs. HC MPP vs. HC + IDC Sensitivity (%) Specificity (%) Sensitivity (%) Specificity (%) Sensitivity (%) Specificity (%) APOC1 + SERPINA3 76.5 87.4 76.5 85.3 77.7 82.9 APOC1 + CFLAR 75.3 82.1 76.5 81.3 75.3 81.8 SERPINA3 + CFLAR 75.3 68.4 74.1 the level of APOC1 protein in MPP was markedly increased when compared with that in HC or IDC. omic results showed that the APOC1 in MPP group presented the best AUC among these three proteins when compare with HC, IDC, or HC combined with IDC. significant proteins by comparison groups AUC 95% CI Sensitivity (%) Specificity (%) P-value Log2 FC MPP vs. HC APOC1 0.853 0.796\u20130.907 77.6 81.1 8.81E\u201318 0.56 SERPINA3 0.739 0.662\u20130.818 77.6 68.4 1.38E\u20137 0.34 CFLAR 0.524 0.436\u20130.61 77.6 42.1 7.56 E\u20133 0. proteins MPP vs. HC MPP vs. IDC MPP vs. HC + IDC Sensitivity (%) Specificity (%) Sensitivity (%) Specificity (%) Sensitivity (%) Specificity (%) APOC1 + SERPINA3 76.5 87.4 76.5 85.3 77.7 82.9 APOC1 + CFLAR 75.3 82.1 76.5 81.3 75.3 81.8 SERPINA3 + CFLAR 7 a majority of the proteins had a cellular distribution and organelles. they were mainly related to binding, catalysis, enzyme regulator, molecular transducer, and transporter. ELISA showed that only the levels of SERPINA3, APOC1, ANXA6, and CFLAR were significantly different among all three groups. sensitivity and specificity accuracy were higher in MPP patients. but larger sample sizes are needed for further identification and quantification. APOC1 is a 6.6-kDa plasma protein that inhibits receptor-mediated lipoprotein clearance. 27 potential MPP plasma biomarkers were identified using LC-MS/MS. APOC1 was identified with satisfactory sensitivity and specificity to discriminate MPP from HC or IDC. authors agreed to be accountable for all aspects of the work.
