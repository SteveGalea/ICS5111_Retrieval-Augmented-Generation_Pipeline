{"summary": "a single 21.2-kb replicase gene at the 5\u2032-end region of the SCV genome is translated into two large replicative polyproteins, pp1ab (790 kDa) and pp1a (490 kDa) the viral replicase synthesizes the entire viral genome (replication) as well as eight subgenomic mRNAs (transcription) (8,9) aptamers against SCV helicase were also reported to have an inhibitory effect against nucleic acids unwinding (17,18). helicase nsP13 has been shown to contain two separate domains, i.e. the helicase domain (Hel) and a metal-binding domain (MBD), which contains several conserved Cys/His residues at the N-terminal (6,19). nsP13 helicase oligomers were loaded onto the 5\u2032-overhang. helicase nsP13 was overexpressed in E. coli and purified as described earlier (18). the mixture was preincubated for 5 min at 22\u00b0C. the reactions were quenched by adding an equal volume of MixB. ds and ssDNAs were resolved by native (urea-free) PAGE. cross-linking reactions were quenched by adding an equal volume of 1 M glycine. protein and nucleic acids SCV helicase nsP13 was overexpressed in E. coli and purified as described earlier (18). ds and ssDNAs were resolved by native (urea-free) PAGE. size markers for the unwound products were produced by heating the duplex substrates with 600-fold trap DNA at 95\u00b0C. radioactivity was quantified using a Cyclone (PerkinElmer) SCV helicase nsP13 has been shown to have dsDNA unwinding activity. the helicase requires an exposed ss DNA or RNA for binding to the nucleic acid complex and the helicase translocates along the nucleic acids by hydrolyzing ATP. the reaction scheme is shown in Figure 1A, in which the helicase is initially allowed to bind to the substrate without ATP hydrolysis. however, the addition of magnesium ions to the reaction allowed the helicase to unwind the DNA duplexes. the nsP13 helicase unwinded the dsDNA substrates and generated ssDNA products that were resolved by non-denaturing PAGE. the kinetic time-course of ssDNA accumulation was plotted and fitted to an exponential function to obtain the reaction amplitudes and unwinding rates of only the helicases that were initially bound to the DNA substrates. the helicase may dissociate from the duplex DNA before it is completely unwound dsDNA substrates contained 20 T tail and 20 bp (open square), 30 bp (filled circle), 40 bp (filled circle), 50 bp (filled inverted triangle), 60 bp (filled inverted triangle), 90 bp (filled square) amplitudes of nP13 are shown in the bar graph against duplex length and amplitudes of NPH (filled triangle) and NS3(filled circle) are marked on the same graph for comparison. oligomer in its active form is non-processive by itself. helicase formation was expected to result in high processivity due to DNA passage through a central channel. however, single-turnover kinetic analysis showed that the T7 helicase by itself has a low processivity for unwinding dsDNA (15 bp), but had a 9-fold higher helicase activity (130 bp) in the presence of polymerase and thioredoxin (31, the extent of stimulation of ATPase activity with ss nucleic acids was previously shown to be proportional to the length of ssDNA or ssRNA at a given concentration (25). this may indicate that nsP13 binds to the ss nucleic acids with a defined binding site size. helicases would be bound to the substrate DNA under the single-turnover reaction condition. t enabled nsP13 to marginally unwind 50 bp duplex DNA substrates. a tail length of 40 nt allowed nsP13 to maximally unwind more duplex DNA (>95%) that was 50 bp in length. the functional nsP13 monomer requires a ssDNA loading strand that is at least 20 nt to translocate and unwind duplex DNA. the nsP13 helicase may recognize the internal ssDNA portion in the gapped DNA as the loading strand. the gap size was varied from 0 to 20 nt and unwinding at the bottom of the strand (30 nt) annealed to the 5\u2032-side of the top strand was displaced only when an overhang was present at the 5\u2032-end. of 0 nt (nicked DNA) was reacted with the nsP13 helicase. no ssDNA product was observed, suggesting the presence of ssDNA of a certain length is required for unwinding by nsP13. nsP13 helicase unwound the substrate with a very low processivity. stacked oligomers and forward movement of nsP13 caused by the binding of multiple nsP13s on the ssDNA tail are believed to be the main reasons for the enhanced unwinding on substrates with a longer ssDNA loading strand. the results suggest multiple nsP13 molecules may bind to the ssDNA loading strand and unwind longer duplex DNA with a higher processivity. nsP13 requires the presence of a longer 5\u2032-ssDNA track to unwind a longer duplex DNA. a 10-nt gap was sufficient for the internal initiation site to completely unwind the 20 bp of the trailing duplex. this indicates that nsP13 requires the presence of a longer 5\u2032-ssDNA track to unwind a longer duplex DNA. it was of interest to determine whether nsP13 might traverse from the 5\u2032-ssDNA tail to the internal gap and facilitate unwinding of the incoming duplex DNA. nsP13 was able to completely unwind the 30-bp DNA duplex on the 3\u2032-side, which was unwound when the gapped DNA substrate without the 5\u2032-ssDNA overhang was used. a portion of the nsP13 helicases may stack up after the 5\u2032-side of the DNA duplex is unwound and may then unwind the 3\u2032-side of the DNA duplex. therefore, the nsP13 helicase can track through the loading strand and facilitate unwinding of the DNA duplex as long as the translocated helicases stay on the track. chemical cross-linking using DMS showed that the degree of cross-linking was nsP13 oligomerization occurs in the presence of ssDNA. the proposed model does not require protein oligomerization per se to obtain greater processivity. the increase in the helicase activity was explained by functional cooperativity rather than structural contacts between helicase monomers. non-processive nsP13 belonging to SF 1 helicase accomplishes substantial processivity in unwinding duplex nucleic acids in vitro. nsP13 may interact with other hosts and/or viral proteins when unwinding its RNA genome in infected cells and it may exhibit different properties during RNA unwinding. nsP13 helicase unwinded the dsDNA substrates and generated ssDNA products that were resolved by non-denaturing PAGE. the trap oligonucleotides prevented the re-initiation of unwinding by trapping free helicases and any helicases that dissociated from the substrates. the amplitude decreased as the length of the DNA duplex increased from 20 to 90 bp. this decrease in amplitude with an increase in duplex length may have occurred partly due to the reannealing of DNA strands behind the helicase and to the helicase dissociation from the DNA during unwinding. however, the large excess of trap DNA that is included in the reaction rapidly anneals to the strand that is displaced from the duplex substrates during unwinding amplitudes of nP13 are shown against duplex length and amplitudes of NPH (filled triangle) and NS3(filled circle) are marked on the same graph for comparison. the processivity of a helicase in unwinding of DNA with a 5\u2032-tail of 20 nt is very low (Figure 2B) compared with other related helicases. nsP13 helicase is a RNA helicase, but little is known about its interaction with RNA. nsP13 has different affinities for various types of DNAs or RNAs. nsP13 stimulated ATPase activity in the presence of polynucleotides. duplex DNA unwinding by 100 nM nsP13 with 2.5 nM of each duplex DNA substrate with various 5\u2032-tail lengths. the quantity of unwound duplex DNA increased as the length of the ss 5\u2032-tail increased. a tighter binding affinity of the helicase monomer or oligomers to longer ss tails might also explain this increase in DNA unwinding. single-turnover unwinding of 50 bp duplex DNA substrates with 5\u2032-overhangs of varying lengths by 0 T (filled circle), 5 T (open circle), 10 T (filled inverted triangle), 15 T (filled square), 30 T (open square) and 40 T (filled diamond) data were fit to a single-exponential. bottom strand annealed to the 5\u2032-side of the top strand was displaced only when an overhang was present at the 5\u2032-end of the gapped DNA duplex. the substrates consisted of two ds regions in the 5\u2032-side (30 bp) and 3\u2032 side (30 bp) of the upper strand. the gap was located between the two ds regions. longer ssDNA tails provide more chances for helicase molecules to bind to ssDNA. longer ssDNA tails provide more chances for helicase molecules to bind to ssDNA. longer ssDNA tails provide more chances for helicase molecules to bind to ssDNA. multiple nsP13 molecules may bind to the ssDNA loading strand and unwind longer duplex DNA with a higher processivity. gapped DNA substrates with or without a 5\u2032-ssDNA tail were readily unwound by nsP13, resulting in displacement of the two duplexes. this result indicates that the two gapped DNA substrates are recognized differently by nsP13 and the 5\u2032-ssDNA loading strand is of primary importance for amplitudes of 0T30bp10G20bp were as follows: 30b (filled circle) = 1.05 0.013, 20b (filled diamond) = 1.01 0.014. to this end, we prepared DNA substrates with a longer trailing duplex (30 bp) and 10-nt gap. a portion of the blunt end duplex might have a 5\u2032-ssDNA at the end due to breathing of the DNA duplex. this effect was not sufficient for the unwinding of the longer 30-bp DNA duplex. this result suggests that the translocated nsP13 molecules pile up and facilitate unwinding of the 3\u2032-side of the DNA duplex by the helicases that are internally bound at the gap. chemical cross-linking with DMS showed that the degree of cross-linking was slightly altered in the presence of ligands. oligomerization of nsP13 is intrinsic property of the protein, which is facilitated in the presence of long ssDNA and ATP. however, we could not determine the definite oligomeric state of the helicase in this study. the proposed model does not require protein oligomerization per se. the increase in the helicase activity was explained by functional cooperativity. multiple molecules of nsP13 loaded on the leading strand are more efficient at unwinding longer substrates under single-turnover conditions.
