{"summary": "a 3-year-old spayed female domestic shorthair cat developed a fever 1 week after starting the anticonvulsant phenobarbital. a diagnostic work-up for seizures and subsequent onset of fever of unknown origin was unremarkable. the cat was switched from phenobarbital onto pregabalin with complete resolution of the fever within 24 h. infectious disease testing submitted on day 1 included feline leukemia virus and Cryptococcus antigen testing, and feline immunodeficiency virus, coronavirus, toxoplasma gondii and bartonella henselae serologic testing. preprandial and postprandial bile acid testing was also performed through the same laboratory (Antech New York laboratory) and were unremarkable. a mature neutrophilia of 18,570 cells/l (2500\u201314,000 cells/l), a mild hypophosphatemia of 2.8 mg/dl (3.4\u20138.5 mg/dl) the cat was then prescribed amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (Clavamox; Zoetis) (12.5 mg/kg PO q12h 7) and marbofloxacin (Zeniquin; Zoetis) (5 mg/kg PO) no physical examination abnormalities the cat was switched from phenobarbital to pregabalin (1 mg/kg PO q12h) the cat was discharged from the hospital on 13 June 2018 (day 13) with a temperature of 102.2\u00b0F. at the 1 month follow-up evaluation the patient\u2019s temperature was 100.3\u00b0F. the cat\u2019s seizures were well-controlled without recurrence of the fever at serial follow-up evaluations. other possible differentials for the cat\u2019s transient fever and hyporexia were considered less likely given the clear upper airway and oral cavity. a drug reaction to doxycycline or clindamycin was less likely, as the cat\u2019s fever was documented after discontinuing the first short course of these medications. drug-induced fever is a condition where a sustained fever occurs after starting a medication and resolves after discontinuing the medication. the cat\u2019s clinical course of fever was more consistent with a phenobarbital-induced fever similar to drug-induced fever reported in humans. anticonvulsant phenobarbital may be implicated in drug-induced fevers."}
