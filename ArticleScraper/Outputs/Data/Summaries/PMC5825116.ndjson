{"summary": "leptospirosis is a worldwide zoonotic disease that affects horses and many other mammalian species, including man. leptospirosis is characterized by spontaneous abortions and recurrent uveitis, with leptospiral abortions occurring late in gestation. infected mares shed leptospires in the urine for up to 14 weeks. d in identification of a number of immunogenic leptospiral proteins that are either exclusively expressed or significantly upregulated during infection in horses. there currently are no diagnostic tests to differentiate these two immune responses. control sera MAT titer UV1 Neg LV1 1:800 (P, G) LE1 1:3200 (P) UV2 Neg LV2 1:1600 (P); 1:800 (G) LE2 1:800 (P) UV3 Neg LV3 1:3200 (P); 1:100 (G) LE3 1:400 (P) UV4 Neg LV4 1:3200 (P); 1:800 (G) LE4 1:400 (P) UV5 Neg all vaccinated and six of the fifteen samples in the infected group were sent to the UKVDL for MAT titers. five milliliters of blood was obtained from the jugular vein of horses using a vacutainer needle, a sleeve, and a 10 ml dry blood collection tube. none of the samples were thawed more than 2 times before the lipidomic analyses were done. 2 mL of methyl-tert-butyl ether were added and the tubes were vigorously shaken at room temperature for 30 min. the tubes were next centrifuged at 5,000 xg for 15 min at room temperature and 1 mL of the upper organic extracts was dried by centrifugal vacuum evaporation. lipid identities were validated by the loss of H2O2 with MS2 and generation of a major fragment for choline phosphate. cations and anions of bromocriptine were used to monitor for potential mass axis drift. control sera MAT titer Vaccinated sera MAT titer UV1 Neg LV1 1:800 (P, G) LE1 1:3200 (P) UV2 Neg LV2 1:1600 (P); 1:800 (G) LE2 1:800 (P) UV3 Neg LV3 1:3200 (P); 1:100 (G) LE3 1:400 (P) UV4 Neg LV4 1:3200 (P); 1:800 (G) LE4 all vaccinated and six of the fifteen samples in the infected group were sent to the UKVDL for MAT titers. six of the 15 samples in the infected group were sent to the UKVDL for MAT titers. 1 mL of water and 2 mL of methyl-tert-butyl ether were added. the tubes were centrifuged at 5,000 xg for 15 min at room temperature. 1 mL of the upper organic extracts was dried by centrifugal vacuum evaporation. diacylglycerols (DG), triacylglycerols (TG) and cholesterol esters (CE) were quantitated. structural identities were validated by the loss of H2O2 with MS2. the cations and anions of bromocriptine were used to monitor for potential mass axis drift. horse LV7, while vaccinated, did not demonstrate a MAT titer (Table 1). cPA changes similar to other vaccinated horses were detected, indicating this lipid is a more sensitive indicator of immune activation. cyclic phosphatidic acids (cPA 16:0, cPA 18:0, cPA 18:0, cPA 18:1, and cPA 18:2) and lysophosphatidylcholines (LPC16:0, LPC 18:0, LPC 18:1, and LPC 18:2) in the validation study. sphingomyelins were selectively elevated in the serum of vaccinated and infected horses. sphingomyelins were selectively elevated in the serum of both vaccinated and infected horses. SM d18:1/22:3, SM d18:1/24:0, SM d18:1/24:0 and SM d18:1/24:2 were detected in a pilot study (N = 6 per group) and a validation study (N = 15 per group). sphingomyelins (SM), SM d18:1/24:0 and SM d18:1:24:2 were detected. cPA cPA 16:0 was elevated in the serum of both the vaccinated and infected equine groups. cyclic phosphatidic acids (cPA) cPA 16:0 was elevated in the serum of both the equine groups. the structures were validated by MS2 with the product anions for glycerophosphate (-H2O) monitored for all 3 cPAs and the respective fatty acid constituents 18:0, 18:1, and 18:2 monitored. horse LV7, while vaccinated, did not demonstrate a MAT titer (Table 1). 1, observed cPA parts per million mass error; 2, observed MS2 product [fatty acid substituent] parts per million mass error; 3, observed MS2 product [glycerophosphocholine -H2O]- parts per million mass error. cPAs are generated by phospholipase D-dependent transphosphatidylation of lysophosphatidylcholines [22], which are generated by phospholipase A2 hydrolysis of phosphatidyl Neutral lipids Diacylglycerols (DAG) were elevated in the serum of both vaccinated and infected horses. these included DAG 34:1, DAG 34:2, DAG 34:3, DAG 36:1, and DAG 36:2. of particular interest, horse LV7 did not demonstrate a MAT titer. sphingomyelins were selectively elevated in the serum of vaccinated horses. these included SM d18:1/18:3, SM d18:1/20:0, SM d18:1/22:1, SM d18:1/22:3, and SM d18:1/24:0. in contrast SM changes similar to other vaccinated horses were detected. a shift in the Th1 and Th2 responses generally results in a shift in the Th1 and Th2 responses. a shift in the Th1 and Th2 responses generally results in infections and inflammatory diseases. up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines with bacterial infections [26, 27], viral infections [28, 29], and parasitic invasions [30] elicit alterations in the Th1 and Th2 cytokine responses. pro-inflammatory cytokines act to induce indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase-1 thereby acting to deplete tryptophan. triacylglycerols were only elevated in the serum of infected horses. sphingomyelins were increased only in the serum of vaccinated horses. cPA biomarkers may be simple biochemical readouts of immune activation. previous reports have consistently demonstrated elevated serum levels of TAGs in both experimental and clinically unresolved immune activation. this is the first report of these changes in DAG levels with immune activation. this is the first report of these changes in DAG levels with immune activation. supporting information S1 Table (XLSX) Click here for additional data file."}
