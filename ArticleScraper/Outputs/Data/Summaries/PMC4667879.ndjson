{"summary": "the causal pathogen, FMDV, belongs to the genus Aphthovirus of the family Picornaviridae. the virion has a high potential for genetic and antigenic variation. vaccines employed to control FMD are inactivated and contain the whole virus in a semi-purified state. lactobacillus plantarum is a lactic acid bacterium present in many ecological niches including naturally fermented food and decaying plant materials. it is considered a probiotic, and its high survival rate within GI-tract makes this bacterium a promising candidate for acceptability as a vehicle for in situ delivery of therapeutically interesting proteins [9\u201311]. female guinea pigs weighing 250 to 300g were kept under pathogen-free conditions with free access to pathogen-free food and water. the daily food and vegetables, such as Chinese cabbage and carrots, can satisfy the nutrient demand of animals. the strains were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth at 37\u00b0C in shaking flasks. the Lactobacillus strains, NC8 and WCFS1, were cultured in man-Rogosa-Sharpe (MRS) medium at 30\u00b0C or 37\u00b0C without shaking. oligonucleotide primer pair used to amplify VP1 sequence. sense primer P1 5\u2019- GAC ATG TCC TCC TGC ATC T -3\u2019. antisense primer P2 5\u2019- CAC AAA TGT ACA GGG ATG GGT -3\u2019. a stationary phase (12 h) culture of recipient Lactobacillus strains, NC8 and WCFS1, was inoculated into 100 mL of MRS broth (containing 2% glycine) without antibiotics at 30\u00b0C without shaking. cells were harvested at OD600 0.3 (about 3 h), put on the ice for 10 minutes, centrifuged at 2,000 r/min for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C and washed two times with an equal culture volume a single electrical pulse was 2,500 V/cm, 2.5 F and delivered via Gene PlusterTM (Bio-Rad) the suspension was immediately put on ice for 5 minutes and 900 L of recovery medium was added. the bacteria were then incubated for 3 h at 30\u00b0C without agitation. pellets were resuspended for analysis via 12% Sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. protein extracts were electro-transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane for western blot analysis using swine anti-FMDV antibodies at a dilution of 1:200 and horseradish-peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-swine IgG antibody. milk C 6 0.2 mL WCFS1 (pSIP411-VP1) + milk E 6 0.2 mL Only milk (control group) CFU: colony forming unit. on days 0 (pre-immune), 10, 20 and 30, 500 L of anticoagulated whole blood samples and 500 L blood samples for serum tests were collected from whole blood of heart. colour development was carried out using o-phenylenediamine (OPD) as substrate. optical absorbance measured at 492 nm within 15 minutes after adding stop buffer. 96-well microplates were coated for 12 h at room temperature. 50 L of FMDV, adjusted to 100 TCID50 by DMEM containing 2% FBS, was added to each well containing serially diluted serum. 100 L of BHK cells (106 cells/mL) was added to each well and incubated with 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C. CFSE-labeled cells were washed three times in PBS containing 3% FBS. then resuspended in 300 L PBS after three. cells were stimulated with 10 g/mL concanavalin A (con A) and 10 g/mL inactivated FMDV antigens. anesthetized guinea pigs were challenged subcutaneously and intradermally in the rear leg with 0.2 mL 100ID50 of FMDV serotype-A. guinea pigs showing FMD-compatible lesions only at the original injection site were judged to be protected, and those showing any FMD clinical signs in the other three feet were judged to be unprotected [20] guinea pigs were anesthetized by exposure to 4% isoflurane for 3 minutes prior to blood collection, saliva collection and FMDV challenge. all surviving guinea pigs were humanely euthanized at end of study. plasmid-free [18] L. plantarum WCFS1 is a single colony isolate of strain NCIMB8826. Apr and Emr indicate ampicillin and erythromycin resistant gene, respectively. BHK cells were cultured in modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM, Gibco) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco), 100 IU/mL penicillin and 100 g/mL at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 condition. 2% instead of 1% glycine was used in the preparation of electro-competent lactobacilli. the cells were harvested at OD600 0.3 (about 3 h), put on the ice for 10 minutes, centrifuged at 2,000 r/min for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C and washed two times with an equal culture volume of ice-cold wash buffer. the cells were resuspended in 1 mL ice-cold sucrose-magnesium chloride electroporation buffer (SMEB) cells were washed three times with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, PH = 7.4) at 4\u00b0C. pellets were resuspended for analysis via 12% Sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) five groups (n = 6) of clean guinea pigs were orally dosed with the Lactobacillus strains with a 1.0 mL syringe. the animals were vaccinated every 7 days with 200 L (109 CFU (colony forming unit) in 200 L of milk for three consecutive days. 96-well microplates were coated for 12 h at room temperature (RT) with rabbit antiserum against FMDV (1:1,000 dilution) and washed three times with PBST. wells were blocked for 2 h at 37\u00b0C with PBST containing 5% skim milk. plates were washed three times with HRP-conjugated goat anti-guinea pig antibody. antibodies were diluted 1:1,000 and incubated for 50 minutes at 37\u00b0C. colour development was carried out using OPD as the substrate. optical absorbance was measured at 492 nm within 15 minutes. read-Muench method was used to calculate the neutralizing antibody titer. the neutralizing antibody titers were calculated as the log10 of the reciprocal of the final serum dilution that neutralized 100 TCID50 of virus in 50% of the wells. cell suspensions were prepared from the spleen on day 30. guinea pigs were challenged subcutaneously and intradermally in the left rear leg with 0.2 mL 100ID50 of FMDV serotype-A. guinea pigs showing FMD-compatible lesions only at the original injection site were judged to be protected, and those showing any FMD clinical signs in the other three feet were judged to be unprotected [20] the cultures were centrifuged and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. immunoreactive bands of approximately 24 kDa were detected in the cell fractions of NC8 containing recombinant plasmids. WCFS1 containing recombinant plasmids was about 26 kDa. anti-FMDV-VP1 IgA levels reached high levels in experimental groups, NC8-pSIP411-VP1 and WCFS1-pSIP411-VP1. no significant anti-FMDV-VP1 antibodies were observed in the control groups. IgM antibodies rose to the highest level in NC8-pSIP411-VP1 and WCFS1-pSIP411-VP1 groups (p0.05) there was no significant difference in IgG levels between the experimental and control groups on day 0 (p>0.05) IgG antibody in serum detected by indirect ELISA on days 0, 10, 20 and 30. data are expressed as mean of optical density (OD) SD (n = 3). CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were analyzed as fluorescence profiles. data are expressed as mean percentages of proliferated cells SD. anti-viral neutralizing serum antibody titers of immunized guinea pigs were assessed. antibody responses of guinea pigs orally immunized with NC8-pSIP411-VP1 or WCFS1-pSIP411-VP1 showed higher FMDV-neutralizing activity than control groups\u2019 responses. WCFS1-pSIP411-VP1 vaccination provided at least partial protection against FMDV challenge. animals showing FMD-compatible lesions only at the original injection site were judged to be protected. WCFS1-pSIP411-VP1 and NC8-pSIP411-VP1 proteins were detected by western blotting. the pSIP411-VP1 plasmid was constructed as described in the article and the purple arrow stands for optimized VP1. anti-FMDV-VP1 IgA reached high levels in experimental groups, NC8-pSIP411-VP1 and WCFS1-pSIP411-VP1. no apparent increase of anti-FMDV-VP1 antibody in control groups. anti-FMDV-VP1 IgG obtained high levels in experimental groups. concentration of IgG in the experimental groups rose further after second immunization. no significant elicitation of anti-FMDV-VP1 IgG antibodies was observed in the milk negative control group. orally administered NC8-pSIP411-VP1 and WCFS1-pSIP411-VP1 were able to elicit both FMDV-specific systemic and mucosal antibody responses. a single-cell suspension of lymphocytes was prepared from immunized guinea pigs on day 30. both NC8-pSIP411-VP1 and WCFS1-pSIP411-VP1 groups produced significantly high levels of T cell proliferation when stimulated by activated FMDV as a specific antigen. PBMCs isolated from guinea pigs 30 days after first immunization were labeled with CFSE. antibody responses of guinea pigs orally immunized with NC8-pSIP411-VP1 or WCFS1-pSIP411-VP1 showed higher FMDV-neutralizing activity than the control groups\u2019 responses. guinea pigs were challenged with 100 GPID50 (50% guinea pigs infectious dose) of homotypic virus on day 30 after the first immunization. animals showing FMD-compatible lesions only at the original injection site were judged to be protected. those showing any FMD clinical signs in the other three feet as second vesicles were judged to be unprotected. Vaccination is the main prophylactic method of preventing FMDV infection. WCFS1, the first genome annotated Lactobacillus strain, was found that it possessed the functionality of homologous signal peptides sequence. lactobacilli as live vectors can persist longer in the GI-tract and some of them have intrinsic probiotic properties. the partial or complete VP1 coding sequence has been used in the development of engineering vaccines accommodating the large-scale production of recombinant protein. studies are currently underway to employ lactic acid bacteria vectors to produce vaccines of many viral proteins. plantarum can induce sIgA antibodies which are considered to be a major effector in the adaptive immune defense of the respiratory mucosa. this study demonstrated that high levels of FMDV-specific IgA were produced in serum, saliva and feces. but the full mechanisms underlying the decrease in respiratory tract infections are still uncertain. studies will explore immune effects of other FMDV gene segments in combination immunologic adjuvants (iFN) expressed by LAB via mucosal routes in different animal models. despite good application prospect of rLAB as therapeutic tools for safe and efficient use, many questions remain unanswered."}
