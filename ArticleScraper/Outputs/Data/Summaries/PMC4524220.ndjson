{"summary": "alphaviruses circulating in the Old World (OW) most commonly cause febrile illness and painful arthralgias or polyarthralgias. new world (NW) alphaviruses target the central nervous system, except Mayaro virus, which is considered an arthritogenic agent like OW alphaviruses. antiviral drugs against VEEV are lacking, and antiviral compounds in development are still at the first stages of evaluation (12\u201314) a better understanding of how viral mRNA is transcribed and capped is essential for the development of screening tools for agents against VEEV and other alphaviruses. the alphavirus MTase activity of nsP1 was first identified in a mutant replicating in insect cells depleted of methionine. the substrate of nsP1 is unlikely to be the cap structure present at the 5\u2032 end of RNA but rather a GTP molecule which becomes methylated at its N7 position (m7GTP) the m7GTP is then used for the guanylylation of nsP1 (m7GMP nsP1 and SFV nsP1 expressed as recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli remain catalytically active for methylation of GTP and covalent binding to nsp1. nsP1 is probably not the only viral nsP involved in the capping mechanism. a purified recombinant protein dissects the MTase activity and m7GMP covalent binding properties of VEEV nsP1. we deciphered by means of site-directed mutagenesis the roles of conserved amino acids in the RNA capping pathway. m7GTP, m7GDP, S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (AdoHcy), auri the codon-optimized DNA encoding nsP1 of VEEV (strain P676, amino acid 1 to 535) was synthesized by GenScript. the DNA sequence was cloned into the expression vector pET28b (Novagen) to enable the fusion of a 6His tag at the C terminus of nsP1. proteins were eluted in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 300 mM NaCl, and 250 mM imidazole. elution was performed using a salt gradient from 100 to 500 mM NaCl. the reaction mixture was resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. methylation reaction mixture containing 50 mM Tris (pH 7.0), 2 mM DTT, 10 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl, 2 mM GTP or GIDP, 0.55 Ci of S-adenosyl-3H]methionine (0.33 M), 10 M AdoMet, and 5 M enzyme was incubated at 30\u00b0C for different periods ranging from 0 to 120 min. ide (PVDF) membrane was blocked overnight at 4\u00b0C in 5% (wt/vol) skim milk solution in TBS-Tween (50 mM Tris [pH 7.6[, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% [vol/vol] Tween) after 3 washes of 10 min each in the TBS-Tween solution, the membrane was incubated with a secondary peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse two-microliter aliquots of the reaction mixture were incubated with 20 l of various reagents at 37\u00b0C for 45 min. the acidic and alkaline solutions were immediately neutralized by the addition of 2 l of 1 M NaOH and HCl. phosphorylated RNAs were purified by ion exchange (IEX)\u2013high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization\u2013time of flight (MALDI-TOF) spectrometry. the 5\u2032 end of the VEEV RNA genome was labeled with cyanine 5-cytidine-5\u2032-phosphate-3\u2032-(6-aminohexyl)phosphate. the covalent m7GMP-nsP1-m7GMP intermediate was prepared at 30\u00b0C for 2 h in a 20-l solution that contained 2 M enzyme, 50 Ci of [-32P]GTP (830 nM), 50 mM Tris (pH 7.0), 2 mM DTT, 10 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2 and 100 M AdoMet. when the reaction was over, half of the reaction mixture the resulting products were loaded on a 7 M urea-PAGE gel (20%) to assess the presence of m7GpppAUGGGCGGCGCAAGA before treatment and released m7GpppA. the vac-CE (New England Biolabs; number M2080S) was used as a positive control for RNA capping and cap detection. site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) all constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. the proteins (wild type [wt] and mutants) were then produced in E. coli Rosetta pLysS (DE3) (Novagen) cells. 20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, and 10% glycerol. elution was performed using a salt gradient from 100 to 500 mM NaCl. standard reactions were carried out at 30\u00b0C for different incubation times. gCl, 2 mM GTP or GIDP, 0.55 Ci of S-adenosyl-[methyl-3H]methionine (0.33 M), 10 M AdoMet, and 5 M enzyme was incubated at 30\u00b0C for different periods ranging from 0 to 120 min. reactions were stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 0.2% SDS and 20 mM EDTA. the membrane was incubated with a secondary peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse antibody (Sigma; number A9044) at a dilution of 1:2,000 in TBS at RT for 1 h. after 3 washes of 10 min each in the TBS-Tween solution, the membrane was incubated with a secondary peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse antibody (Sigma; number A9044 phosphorylated RNAs were treated with a mixture of N,O-bis-trimethylacetamide (0.4 ml), CH3CN (0.8 ml), and triethylamine (0.1 ml) at 35\u00b0C for 15 min. phosphorylated RNAs were purified by ion exchange (IEX)\u2013high-performance liquid chromatography. the 5\u2032 end of the VEEV RNA genome was labeled with cyanine 5-cytidine-5\u2032-phosphate-3\u2032-(6-aminohexyl)phosphate by a ligation reaction. RNA and pCpCy5 were incubated in the presence of ATP for 16 h. 2 l of the 32P-labeled covalent intermediate was mixed with 18 l of solution that contained 50 mM Tris (pH 7.0), 2 mM DTT, 10 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2 and 100 M AdoMet. the reaction mixture was precipitated with ethanol in the presence of glycogen (Sigma; number G1767). wild type (wt) and nine mutants of VEEV nsP1 were produced and purified with a 6His tag fused to their C termini. all the residues selected for alanine substitution are strictly conserved within the alphavirus genus except E118, which is replaced by another acidic amino acid (D) nsP1 sequences were aligned by T-coffee (70). secondary structural elements with a reliability are marked with squiggles. helices appear as small squiggles, -strands appear as dotted lines. imagestimulated luminescence events per square millimeter were determined by Image Gauge software. formation of a covalent m7GMP-nsP1 intermediate was investigated using SDS-PAGE after incubation of VEEV nsP1 with radiolabeled [-32P]GTP in the presence of the methyl donor AdoMet. is m7GMP-nsP1 as described in case of SINV and SFV nsP1. together, these data suggest that VEEV nsP1 covalently binds m7GMP in an AdoMet-dependent reaction. m7GMP-nsP1 intermediate was compared to that of vaccinia virus (VV) capping enzyme (CE) linking GMP by phosphoamide bond with the -amino group of a lysine [CE-(lysyl-N)-GMP] the complexes were next incubated in various buffers in order to follow their stability under different reaction conditions. the m7GMP-nsP1 intermediate is stable at neutral pH ( m7GMP-nsP1 or vaccinia virus GMP-CE intermediates formed as described in Materials and Methods were incubated separately with 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), 0.1 M HCl, 0.1 M NaOH, or 0.1 M or 1 M hydroxylamine (pH 7.5) at 37\u00b0C for 45 min, then separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. to make it possible, we set up a filter-based time course experiment results presented in Fig. 5A indicate that the reaction efficacy is slightly higher for GIDP than for GTP. one can conclude that the methylation can be followed using GIDP instead of GTP in order to decouple MTase and GT reaction. m7GMP-nsP1 complex was incubated with m7GTP plus AdoMet or m7GTP. m7GMP-nsP1 complex was detected by an antibody recognizing specifically the m3G/m7G cap structures. however, in the absence of Mg2+ or AdoMet, only a slight fraction of m7GMP-nsP1 was detected. m7GTP is preferred substrate for nsP1 guanylylation. cap analogs mimicking VEEV mRNA (m7GpppA and m7GpppG) cannot form a covalent binding with nsP1 as expected. effects of the mutations could be grouped into four categories. m7GMP-nsP1 formation refers to detection of guanylylated nsP1 in presence of [-32P]GTP and AdoMet. nsP1 mutants loaded on a 10% Coomassie blue-stained SDS-PAGE gel. m7GMP-nsP1 is a covalent intermediate in the presence of m7GTP and AdoHcy. the mutagenesis experiments also show that D63A and Y285A limit both MTase and GT, suggesting a strong interplay between the two activities. fluorescence polarization was followed at 675 nm. higher polarization values were obtained with 5\u2032-phosphorylated RNAs. the presence of a cap structure or a hydroxyl group at the 5\u2032 end of RNA strongly reduced the interaction. m7GMP-nsP1complex (H45A, E118A, D345A, and R365A mutants) were also tested for the ability to transfer m7Gp on the 5\u2032 end of RNA. they all displayed cap binding activity (data not shown) as for the MTase and GT activities, D345A and R365A mutations resulted in an efficiency higher than that of the wild type nsP1 protein. GA RNA were incubated with the 32P-labeled covalent nsP1-m7GMP intermediate (lanes 4, 5, and 6) at 30\u00b0C for 2 h. the reaction products were recovered by ethanol precipitation and then treated with nuclease P1 (lanes 2, 5, and 8) or with nuclease P1 then CIAP (lanes 3, 6, and 9) the nuclease P1 reaction was performed at low pH (5.3) nsP1 is a key enzyme in alphavirus replication. nsP1 is an attractive target for the development of antiviral compounds limiting nsP1 functions related to RNA capping. inhibition of VEEV nsP1 methylation was tested by incubating nsP1 with guanylylimidodiphosphate (GIDP), S-adenosyl-[methyl-3H]methionine, and AdoMet. nsP1 was incubated together with m7GTP, AdoHcy, and MgCl2 in the presence of increasing concentrations of sinefungin, ATA, or the wild type (wt) and nine mutants of VEEV nsP1 were produced and purified with a 6His tag fused to their C termini. all the residues selected for alanine substitution are strictly conserved within the alphavirus genus except E118, which is replaced by another acidic amino acid. nsP1 sequences were aligned by T-coffee (70) secondary structural elements with a reliability are marked with squiggles ( helices) or arrows (-strands) if reliability is low, helices appear as small squiggles, -strands appear as dotted lines. the formation of a covalent m7GMP-nsP1 complex was investigated using SDS-PAGE after incubation of VEEV nsP1 with radiolabeled [-32P]GTP in the presence of the methyl donor AdoMet. the optimal pH was around 7, and the standard reaction buffer contained 50 mM Tris (pH 7.0), 100 M AdoMet, and 2 mM magnesium. nsP1 covalently binds m7GMP in an AdoMet-dependent reaction. the activity assays were carried out at 30\u00b0C by incubating the nsP1 with [-32P]GTP, [-32P]GTP, [-32P]GTP, [-32P]GTP, or [-32P]ATP. cinia virus (VV) capping enzyme (CE) linking GMP by phosphoamide bond with the -amino group of a lysine [CE-(lysyl-N)-GMP] complexes were formed by incubation of nsP1 or VV CE with [32P]GTP in the presence or absence of AdoMet. the complexes were next incubated in various buffers in order to follow their stability under different reaction conditions m7GMP-nsP1 or vaccinia virus GMP-CE intermediates formed as described in Materials and Methods were incubated separately with 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), 0.1 M HCl, 0.1 M NaOH, or 0.1 M or 1 M hydroxylamine (pH 7.5) at 37\u00b0C for 45 min, then separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. to make it possible, we set up a filter-based experiment results presented in Fig. 5A indicate that the reaction efficacy is slightly higher for GIDP than for GTP. one can conclude that the methylation can be followed using GIDP instead of GTP in order to decouple MTase and GT reaction. nsP1 is Mg2+ independent, as 5 mM EDTA does not block the reaction. m7GMP-nsP1 complex was incubated with m7GTP plus AdoMet or m7GTP. the reaction products were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel before immunoblotting. m7GMP-nsP1 complex was detected by antibodies recognizing specifically the m3G/m7G cap structures. m7GpppA and m7GpppG cannot form a covalent binding with nsP1 as expected, suggesting that the viral RNA capping is probably not a reversible mechanism. the effects of the nsP1 mutations on the MTase and GT activities could be grouped into four categories. m7GMP-nsP1 formation refers to detection of guanylylated nsP1 in presence of [-32P]GTP and AdoMet. nsP1 mutants loaded on a 10% Coomassie blue-stained SDS-PAGE gel. the mutagenesis experiments also show that D63A and Y285A limit both MTase and GT, suggesting a strong interplay between the two enzymatic activities. we first compared the RNA binding properties of nsP1 with a 15-nucleotide RNA mimicking the 5\u2032 end of the VEEV genome. higher polarization values were obtained with 5\u2032-phosphorylated RNAs. the presence of a cap structure or a hydroxyl group at the 5\u2032 end of RNA strongly reduced the interaction. the plateau of fluorescence was not reached under our experimental conditions. mutants were tested for the ability to transfer m7Gp on the 5\u2032 end of RNA. they all displayed cap binding activity (data not shown) as for the MTase and GT activities, D345A and R365A mutations resulted in an efficiency higher than that of the wild type nsP1 protein. nsP1-m7GMP intermediate (lanes 4, 5, and 6) at 30\u00b0C for 2 h. reaction products were recovered by ethanol precipitation. then treated with nuclease P1 (lanes 2, 5, and 8) or with nuclease P1 then CIAP (lanes 3, 6, and 9) m7GMP could correspond to released m7GMP from remaining VEEV nsP1 and VV CE. nsP1 is a key enzyme in alphavirus replication. nsP1 is an attractive target for the development of antiviral compounds. inhibition of VEEV nsP1 methylation was tested by incubating nsP1 with guanylylimidodiphosphate (GIDP), S-adenosyl-[methyl-3H]methionine, and AdoMet. nsP1 was incubated together with m7GTP, AdoHcy, and MgCl2 in the presence of increasing concentrations of sinefungin, ATA, or VEEV nsP1 carries both Mtase and GT activities. m7GTP forms a covalent link with nsP1 (m7GMP-nsP1), releasing PPi. m7Gp can be transferred to the 5\u2032 end (RNA capping), generating capped RNA. the MTase activity does not require divalent ions, whereas GT is Mg2+ or Mn2+ dependent. this feature is conserved among alphavirus nsP1 enzymes (17\u201319) and alphavirus-like capping enzymes (34) the methyltransfer reaction poorly inhibits nsP1 MTase activity (data not shown) covalent binding assay showed and phosphates are hydrolyzed during formation of the m7Gp-nsP1 adduct. m7GDP is also able to covalently bind to nsP1 but nsP1 is poorly active as a methyltransferase on GDP. nsP1 is able to bind specifically 5\u2032-phosphorylated RNA. m7GMP is released from nsP1 and transferred to an RNA. a poor transfer on a triphosphate RNA could also be observed. the mutation is located in the consensus site UU[D/E]Uooxo (ILDIGSAP sequence in VEEV nsP1) where U represents hydrophobic acids, \u201co\u201d small residues (often a G), and x any amino acid (22, 61) the mutation of the aspartic acid might prevent the recruitment of AdoMet and AdoHcy, known to be stabilized in MTase. the two stabilizing substitutions, D354A and R365A, also improve the guanylyltransfer on RNA, reinforcing the role of these mutations in protein stabilization. because of its unconventional mechanism, alphavirus mRNA capping is an attractive target for the design of specific inhibitors. but nsP1 has been poorly addressed to date as an antiviral target, and except several guanosine or cap analogs (59), no small molecules have been tested the antiviral effect of ribavirin is not predominantly a result of IMPDH inhibition (67) among alphaviruses, viruses resistant to ribavirin possess mutations at the N terminus of nsP1. we can exclude that its antiviral effect is directly due to capping inhibition and deduce that it is more likely an indirect effect on the cellular GTP concentration."}
