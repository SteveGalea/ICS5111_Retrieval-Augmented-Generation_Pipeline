{"summary": "the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) resulted in over 8,000 infected people, with 10% mortality (1). a recently emerged coronavirus has infected over 837 people, with 291 deaths. PLpro is encoded in the viral replicase polyprotein and is critical for processing the polyprotein to generate a functional replicase complex. PLpro is also a viral deubiquitinase (DUB) that can cleave ubiquitin (Ub) or ubiquitin-like molecules, such as interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15), from substrate proteins. recombinant adenovirus infects mice with recombinant adenovirus expressing the human DPP4 receptor. recombinant adenovirus expressing the human DPP4 receptor renders them susceptible to infection under BSL-3 conditions (29), and by generating recombinant HKU5 expressing the SARS-CoV spike protein (30). development of additional affordable and adaptable small-animal models is needed to evaluate antivirals against existing and deISGylating enzymes can be used to \u201ctoggle off\u201d the effect of ISG15 in this system. the chimeric Sindbis-ISG15-protease system could be exploited as a surrogate system to evaluate enzymatic activity and inhibition. pcDNA-MERS-PLpro and its catalytic mutant (C1592A) were generated in our laboratory. the synthesis and characterization of PLpro inhibitors 3e and 3h were described by Baez-Santos et al. a catalytically inactive mutant of PLpro (cysteine 1651 to alanine) was generated as described previously (18) by site-directed mutagenesis PCR using primers (available upon request) the DNAs of interest were cut from recombinant pUC57 plasmids, cloned into the TE12Q vector, and designated SIP-SWT and SIP-MMT. 105 cells per well in a 24-well plate were infected with each SIP virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) to analyze the replication of SIP viruses, viral growth kinetics assays were performed. cells were transfected with 0.25 g pcDNA3-myc-ISG15 and 0.125 g each of ISGylating enzyme expression plasmids. at 6 h posttransfection, the medium was replaced by mock or SIP virus inoculum at an MOI of 5. cell lysates were prepared at 18 h postinfection using 100 l lysis buffer. seven- to 8-week-old male IFNAR/ mice were infected subcutaneously in the left hindpad with 6 106 PFU of SIP virus diluted in 25 l DMEM. when the weight loss of an infected mouse was more than 25% of the initial body weight, the mouse was humanely euthanized. survival rate was calculated by counting dead or euthanized mice. amine-xylazine was infected with 2 104 PFU of the rMA15 virus or with PBS in a dose of 50 l. infected animals were monitored daily for weight loss and sacrificed upon approaching 80% of their starting body weight. pcDNA-MERS-PLpro and its catalytic mutant (C1592A) were generated in our laboratory as described previously (35). the synthesis and characterization of PLpro inhibitors 3e and 3h were described by Baez-Santos et al. a catalytically inactive mutant of PLpro (cysteine 1651 to alanine) was generated as described previously (18) by site-directed mutagenesis PCR using primers (available upon request) the DNAs of interest were cut from recombinant pUC57 plasmids, cloned into the TE12Q vector, and designated SIP-SWT and SIP-MMT. the fragment of ISG15-IRES-PL cell lysates were separated in an SDS-10% PAGE gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for 1 h at 65 V. the membrane was blocked using 5% dried skim milk in TBST buffer (0.9% NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Tween 20) for 2 h at room temperature. BHK-21 cells were transfected with 0.25 g pcDNA3-myc-ISG15 and 0.125 g each of ISGylating enzyme expression plasmids (pcDNA3-Ube1L, pcDNA3-UbcH8 and pcDNA3-Herc5) at 6 h posttransfection, the medium was replaced by mock or SIP virus inoculum. seven- to 8-week-old male IFNAR/ mice were infected subcutaneously in the left hindpad with 6 106 PFU of SIP virus diluted in 25 l DMEM. when the weight loss of an infected mouse was more than 25% of the initial body weight, the mouse was humanely euthanized. the survival rate was calculated by counting the dead or euthanized mice. infected animals were monitored daily for weight loss and sacrificed upon approaching 80% of their starting body weight. the viral titers were determined by plaque assay on vero-E6 cells. DNA sequences comprising the ISG15-IRES-PLpro appear in GenBank under accession numbers NP_828849 and AFS88944 respectively. the expression of ISG15 and PLpro was detected by immunoblotting lysates prepared from virus-infected cells. the four SIP viruses replicate with similar kinetics and to high titer in BHK-21 cells. these viruses were stable upon passage in BHK-21 cells. western blot results showed that cellular proteins were ISGylated in cells transfected with ISGylation machinery plasmids. the level of ISGylated proteins was significantly reduced in cells infected with SIP-WT, but not SIP-MT, virus. the decreased level of ISGylated proteins in SIP-WT-infected cells is not due to virus-induced cell death or lack of host translation. the expression of PLpro and beta-actin as a loading control was detected with anti-V5 and anti-beta-actin antibodies. PLpro disrupts ISG15-mediated protection in mice, suggesting its role in antagonizing the immune response. the majority of chimeric-virus-infected mice succumbed to infection at 8 to 12 days p.i. the differential survival times may due to the different genetic backgrounds of the mouse strains. we wanted to determine if this chimeric Sindbis virus-mouse system could be used to evaluate small-molecule inhibitors directed against the PLpro domain. compound 3e blocks deISGylating activity of PLpro in cell culture. this indicates that the deISGylating activity of PLpro was blocked by compound 3e. compound 3e blocks deISGylating activity of PLpro in cell culture. BHK-21 cells were transfected with ISGylating machinery plasmids and infected with SIP-SWT virus as indicated. expression of PLpro, USP18, and beta-actin as a loading control was detected with anti-V5, anti-hemagglutinin (HA), and anti-beta-actin antibodies. compound 3e blocks PLpro from disrupting ISG15-mediated protection in IFNAR/ mice. mice were infected subcutaneously with SIP-SWT virus at 0 days p.i. and administered 50 g per mouse of compound 3e or vehicle only i.p. at 0 and 2 days p.i. protease inhibitor 3e was capable of protecting the majority of mice from lethal systemic SIP virus infection. the inhibitor is either not sufficiently stable or bioavailable in the respiratory tract to reduce the replication and pathogenesis of a respiratory tract infection with SARS-CoV MA15 in mice. four chimeric Sindbis viruses expressing wild-type (WT) or catalytic cysteine mutant (MT) PLpros from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were generated and named SIP-SWT, SIP-SMT, SIP-MWT, and SIP-MMT respectively. the expression of ISG15 and PLpro was detected by immunoblotting lysates prepared from virus-infected cells. PLpros expressed by chimeric Sindbis virus have deISGylating activity. western blot results showed cellular proteins were ISGylated in cells transfected with ISGylation machinery plasmids. the level of ISGylated proteins was significantly reduced in cells infected with SIP-WT. new tab PLpros expressed by chimeric Sindbis virus have deISGylating activity. the cells were transfected with ISGylating machinery expression plasmids. the cell lysates were probed with anti-myc to detect ISGylated proteins and unconjugated ISG15. PLpros of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are capable of disrupting the ISG15-mediated protection in IFNAR/ mice. in our system, the SIP virus-infected mice approached maximum weight loss at 5 to 6 days p.i. and then either recovered or succumbed to infection. the majority of chimeric-virus-infected mice succumbed to infection at 8 to 12 days p.i. we recently designed and evaluated the biological activity of a second generation of SARS-CoV PLpro inhibitors in vitro (36) one of these compounds, 3e, inhibits SARS-CoV PLpro with a potency of 390 nM and has an antiviral potency of 8.3 M against SARS-CoV in vero-E6 cells. the compound is not cytotoxic, does not bind to human serum albumin, and has increased metabolic stability compared to other compound 3e blocks deISGylating activity of USP18. results suggest compound 3e blocks deISGylating activity of SARS-CoV PLpro in cell culture. compound 3e blocks PLpro from disrupting ISG15-mediated protection in IFNAR/ mice. mice were administered 50 g per mouse of compound 3e or vehicle only i.p. at 0 and 2 days p.i. the mice were monitored for body weight loss (A) and survival (B) mice treated with compound 3e were not protected from virus-induced weight loss or virus replication. the poly(IC)-treated mice were completely protected from virus replication. the virus titers showed significant reduction in virus replication compared to the untreated-virus control. chimeric Sindbis virus-protease system enables the study of enzymes with deISGylating activity. it is the first demonstration of the efficacy of an inhibitor that targets a viral papain-like cysteine protease (PLpro) in a virus-infected animal. e lacking ISG15 are more susceptible to lethal infection with Sindbis virus, herpesvirus, and influenza virus (32, 37). the role of ISG15 in CoV pathogenesis is not yet clear. a major advantage of the SIP virus system is that we were able to study the PLpros in mice in a BSL-2 environment. a mouse model is used in BSL-2 containment, and experiments are cost-effective. we envision expanding the SIP virus system to identify broad-spectrum PLpro inhibitors that block a wide array of human and bat PLpro activities. we can evaluate the efficacy of an inhibitor of a novel bat PLpro without the need for developing a transgenic-mouse model expressing the receptor.
