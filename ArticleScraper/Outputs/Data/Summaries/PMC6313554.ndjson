{"summary": "about 17,000 suspected patients were isolated by 23 December 2015. 80% of the total MERS patients in south Korea were infected in healthcare facilities by four super-spreaders. this indicates the importance of the isolation and treatment of super-spreaders using prompt epidemiologic investigations. super-spreaders play a significant role in large-scale infection cases. it is important to identify and prevent any possible infection route of such super-spreaders, regardless of its relative probability. infections via other routes, such as fomites and air, were suspected. the aim of this study was to identify the airflow as a possible infection routes of secondary infected patients, for whom close contact was not identified. the initial patient infected 38 people after being admitted to the hospital on 15 May 2015, for two nights and three days. the initial patient was assumed to mostly cause infections on the eighth floor, and infections on the seventh floor spread through secondary infected patients. a tracer experiment was conducted using sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) gas as the tracer gas. SF6 gas is commonly used to trace the dispersion of pollution substances. the tracer gas was continuously generated on the bed in the room of the initial patient, at a rate of 1 L/min. the hospital, located 65 km south of Seoul, was built at the beginning of 2015. it is a nine-story building with inpatient wards on the fourth to the ninth floors. initial patient was admitted on the eighth floor for three days. initial patient was assumed to mostly cause infections on the eighth floor. at the end of tracer gas experiment, the airflow near room 8104 was visualized and verified using a smoke generator. the conditions of the eighth floor were maintained, as during the MERS outbreak, with exception of the external conditions. the operation of the ventilation systems and the opening of the doors were changed during the experiment, as their status could not be confirmed from the investigation. the range of the MERS infection, known to spread through droplets, is within 2 m. contact by the movement of the infected patients was also suspected. there were many secondary infected patients, for whom contact due to the movement of the initial patient was not confirmed. the air conditioner in each room can be operated by the patient. in the corridor, air conditioners were installed in the ceiling without any ventilation systems. the windows were mostly open, due to the mild outdoor temperature, with exception of night time. room 8104 was the farthest from the source and had SF6 concentrations similar to or higher than those of the rooms adjacent to room 8104. the attack rate of room 8110 was also the highest among the measured rooms. the airflow from room 8104 to the corridor was confirmed using a smoke generator. a large amount of outside air was introduced by strong westerly winds through the relatively small window of the room. a large amount of outside air was introduced by strong westerly winds through the relatively small window of the room at approximately 17 ACH. in each of the adjacent rooms (8103 and 8105), one patient and one caregiver were infected. one patient in room 8102 was also infected, without the display of symptoms. the range of the MERS infection, known to spread through droplets, is within 2 m. diffusers with diameters of 300 mm were located at the window side. exhaust vents of the same size were located at the door side. only room 8104, in which the initial patient was hospitalized, does not have a ventilation system. in room 8106, the concentration was relatively low, similar to that of room 8103. however, it increased to 2.07 ppm, and maintained an average value of 1.63 ppm. after the door was closed, the concentration of room 8104 increased by approximately 20%. room 8104 8103 8106 8110 8113 8218 average 49.5 0.18 0.71 2.09 0.63 0.048 (100%) (0.36%) (1.43%) (4.22%) (1.27%) (0.10%) airflow from room 8104 to the corridor was confirmed using a smoke generator. a large amount of outside air was introduced through the relatively small window of the room at approximately 17 ACH. the highest concentration of SF6 gas from room 8104 was in room 8110, which is one of the rooms on the east side. the results of the tracer-gas experiment revealed that the highest concentration of SF6 gas from room 8104 was in room 8110. the air-conditioner filter was detected in the ceiling of the room opposite room 8104. the ventilation system and air-conditioner were in the room, and the patient had access to them. it is not clear whether the ventilation system was operated during the outbreak. the average wind speed was 2.15 m/s, the maximum wind speed was 10.9 m/s. it is possible that airborne particles from room 8104 were introduced to the corridor by the outside air entering through the window. this is similar to the external airflow observed when the tracer experiment was conducted using SF6 gas. the SF6 gas used in the tracer-gas experiment was simulated using tracer gas. this experiment has been widely used to observe the dispersion phenomenon of airborne bacteria. however, at sites different to controlled laboratories, it is difficult to derive reproducible results due to interference from high-concentration airborne particles already present in indoor and outside air. on 8 June 2015, approximately 1 week after the hospital was evacuated, we identified the dispersion of tracer gas from the initial patient room to long-distance patient rooms. the results correspond epidemiologically with attack rates. however, the correspondence does not directly indicate infection by the dispersed portion of tracer gas from the initial patient room. uspected patients were quarantined in negative pressure isolation wards. the findings can be used in initial epidemiological investigations and precautions."}
