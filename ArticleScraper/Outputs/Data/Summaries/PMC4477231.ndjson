{"summary": "canine calicivirus (CaCV, strain 48) was used as a surrogate27 for human norovirus. the device consists of a portable 12 volt operated ionizer, with a collector plate of positive charge attached to the ionizer. testing revealed that 40\u201360 min was required to eliminate >90% of free latex particles in the air as determined by real-time particle counting. the ionizing device was developed based on the Ion-Flow Ionizing Technology from LightAir AB, Solna, Sweden. it was modified by installing a plastic-cup with a conductive surface of 47 mm in diameter, with positive charge, as the collector plate. RT-qPCR data shows the active collector is concentrating and collecting virus 1500\u20133000 times more efficient as compared to the inactive collector. ionizing air reduces calicivirus and rotavirus infectivity. five mL of cell culture medium containing 1 106 peroxidase forming units of rotavirus respectively of CaCV were aerosolized and collected during 40 min. 74 104 1.24 104 40.1% 2.96 102 7.83 104a >97.4%a RRV n.d. n.d. 4.86 101 7.66 103a >98.4%a aUnder detection limit (10 peroxidase forming units/mL) rotavirus was nebulized without ionizing and allowed to be trapped to an inactive collector plate. guinea pigs (n = 4) were intranasally infected with 5 103 pfu of Pan/99 virus in 100 uL (50 uL in each nostril) at 30 h p.i. four nave uninfected guinea pigs were placed in cage \u201cB\u201d. active ionizer prevents aerosol transmitted influenza virus (H3N2, Pan/99) infection between guinea pigs. 3 of 4 animals were infected when the inactive ionizer was used. ovirus was used as a surrogate marker for human rotavirus29. the device consists of a portable 12 volt operated ionizer with a collector plate of positive charge attached to the ionizer. latex particles with sizes ranging from 1 to >10 m were nebulized into a room of 19 m3. RT-qPCR data shows that the active collector is concentrating and collecting virus 1500\u20133000 times more efficient as compared to the inactive collector. no influenza virus was detected on the inactive ionizer. five mL of cell culture medium containing 1 106 peroxidase forming units of rotavirus respectively of CaCV were aerosolized and collected during 40 min to an active collector plate. caCV exposed to an active and inactive collector plate, without being aerosolized, showed a slight reduction in infectivity (40%) in comparison to virus that have been trapped on an inactive collector plate. rotavirus was nebulized without ionizing and allowed to be trapped to an inactive collector plate. the result concluded that the genome copy versus infectivity ratio was unchanged from that of the viral stock. ionizing air and electrostatic attraction prevents airborne-transmitted influenza A/Panama virus infection between guinea pigs. uninfected animals in cage \u201cB\u201d were exposed for 24 hours with airflow from cage \u201cA\u201d hosting the 4 infected guinea pigs. RT-qPCR of lung- and trachea biopsies examined at 54 h p.i. from the nasally experimentally infected animals. 3 out of 4 guinea pigs in both experiments were positive for influenza. the active ionizer prevented 4 of 4 exposed guinea pigs from developing an immune response to influenza virus. 3 of 4 animals were infected when the inactive ionizer was used. a broad range of particles sizes, from 35 nm to 10 m was concentrated, suggesting a wide application range of the technology. too large particles may decrease the recovery since these are proposed to remain for less time in the air33,34. rotavirus from 4.9 101 to 7.6 103) in ionized air as determined by a ratio of infectivity versus gene copies. reduced infectivity has been proposed to be due to reactive oxygen species and ozone. protein peroxidation may play a key role in inactivation of non-enveloped viruses. infectivity was not lost when virus was nebulized into the air of the room without ionization. most reduction of infectivity may be due to increased negative charged levels, presumably resulting in changes in isoelectric point and thus structural changes of the capsid. guinea pigs were infected following short-range aerosol transmission with a dose of 103 pfu. 3 of 3 animals became infected with a dose of 106 pfu. guinea pigs have developed a significant immune response. the experimental room has a volume of 19 m3 (B250*L330*H235cm) one active and one inactive ionizer device was placed in the room at equal distance (215 cm) from the nebulizer. a particle counter (PortaCount Plus, TSI Incorporated, USA) was used before and during the experiment. a steady-state ozone concentration below the detection limit (0,002 ppm) was tested by VTT Technical Research Center of Finland, Tampere, Finland. after the end of the sampling period, the ionizer was turned off. the collector plate was covered with a lid and stored at 20 \u00b0C. the results from the active- and inactive ionizers were compared. a polycarbonate 0.6 m filter was fitted to an airtight gadget (GP Plastindustri AB, Gislaved, Sweden) the filter was dried in room temperature, coated with 40 thick layer of ionized gold. the method has previously been used and reported in studies of cytomegalovirus as well as cerebrospinal fluid41,42,43. Quantitative real-time PCR for rotavirus Rhesus rotavirus was detected and quantified using a LUX real-time PCR assay. this real-time PCR uses labeled primers with different fluorophores for each VP6 subgroup and external plasmid standards. rhesus rotavirus and CaCV were aerosolized and collected on active ionizer collector plates, covered with 1 mL of Eagles MEM. ionized air per se had an effect on viral infectivity. plates were stored at 20 \u00b0C until determination of viral infectivity and number of genome copies. female guinea pigs, 300\u2013350 g, strain Hartley, were housed at astrid Fagraeus Laboratory, Solna, Stockholm. the experimental protocol was approved by the Animal Ethics Committee in Stockholm. the four nave guinea pigs were exposed for 24 hours and then put into individually ventilated cages. the animals were removed after the exposure time and lung and trachea biopsies were collected. serum was collected from the uninfected guinea pigs and prevalence of antibodies against influenza A virus was determined by ELISA. guinea pig antibody (Vector, BA-7000) and horseradish-peroxidase (HRP) conjugated Streptavidin (DAKO, Denmark, P0397), both at a dilution of 1:3000. plates were then washed x5 and 100 L of tetramethyl benzidine (TMB) substrate (Sigma Aldrich, T-0440-16) was added to each well, the reaction developed for 10 min and stopped by the real-time PCR reaction was performed in a Corbett Rotor-Gene 6000 (Qiagen) with the following cycling protocol: 50 \u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 45 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 5 seconds and 57 \u00b0C for 15 seconds. a particle counter (PortaCount Plus, TSI Incorporated, USA) was used before and during the experiment. the ionizer creates electrons, which will render surface molecules of particles negatively charged thus attracting them to the positively charged collector plate. the device generates approximately 35 000 billion electrons per second (www.lightair.com) with a steady-state ozone concentration below the detection limit (0,002 ppm) carbon/Formvar-coated 400 mesh copper grids were placed on the collector during aerosol experiment with influenza- and rotavirus. grids were then rehydrated in Eagles MEM containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) before being negatively stained with 2% phosphotungstic acid and analyzed by TEM. reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) bead (GE-Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) was carried out for 40 min at 42 \u00b0C to produce the cDNA later used for real-time PCR. quantitative real-time PCR for rotavirus was detected and quantified using a LUX real-time PCR assay. cooling to 60 \u00b0C for 1 min and subsequent heating to 95 \u00b0C at 0.8 \u00b0C min1 with continuous fluorescence recording. rhesus rotavirus and CaCV were aerosolized and collected on active ionizer collector plates. each in a total volume of 5 mL was collected for 40 min followed by determination of viral infectivity and number of genome copies. female guinea pigs, 300\u2013350 g, strain Hartley, were housed at astrid Fagreaus Laboratorium, Solna, Stockholm. the experimental protocol was approved by the Animal Ethics Committee in Stockholm (Permit Number: N177/11) 103 pfu of pan/99 virus in 100 uL (50 uL in each nostril) all four infected animals were placed in the experimental cage. air flowed freely between cages, but direct contact between inoculated and exposed animals was prohibited. serum samples were diluted 1:100 and further in two-fold dilutions in dilution buffer. plates were then washed x5 and incubated for 60 min at 37 \u00b0C. reaction developed for 10 min and stopped by addition of 100 L of 2 M H2SO4. real-time PCR reaction was performed in a Corbett Rotor-Gene 6000 (Qiagen) with the following cycling protocol: 50 \u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 45 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 5 seconds and 57 \u00b0C for 15 seconds."}
