{"summary": "quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is a well-established technique to quantify precise mRNA levels of target gene of interest in different biological samples. quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is a well-established and widely used technique to quantify precise mRNA levels of target gene of interest in different biological samples. studies have successfully been conducted to identify least regulated and stably expressed RGs [9\u201311] across tissues of various species such as human, pig, sheep, bovines etc. not much information is available on set of suitable reference/RGs genes that can be used in lactation or physiological studies in riverine buffaloes. RNA integrity was confirmed by denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis. RNA samples were stored at -80\u00b0C till further use. cDNA was synthesized using 100ng RNA as described in previous studies. dehydrogenase GAPDH BC102589 TGGAAAGCATCACCATCT CCCACTTGATGTTGGCAG EXON 4\u20135 60\u00b0C 60 Eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 1 EEF1A1 BC105315 CATCCCAGGCTGACTGTGC TGTAAGCCAAAAGGGCATGC EXON 3\u20134 60\u00b0C 101 2 Microglobulin B2M NM_173893 CTGCTATGTGTG the reactions set up in Step one plus real time PCR instrument (ABI, California) were performed at 2 min at 50\u00b0C, 10 min at 95\u00b0C, 40 cycles of 15 s at 95\u00b0C (denaturation) and 1 min at 60\u00b0C (annealing+extension) algorithm ranks the reference genes by calculating cross point standard deviations. results were displayed as standard deviation (S.D) and coefficient of variance (C.V) cDNA was then diluted 1:4 (v:v) with DNase/RNase free water. sufficient cDNA was prepared in a single run to perform the qPCR experiments. qPCR reactions were performed in a final volume of 10 L containing 4 L diluted cDNA combined with 6 L of master mix (2X) the reactions were performed in a final volume of 10 L containing 4 L diluted cDNA combined with 6 L of master mix. up in step one plus real time PCR instrument (ABI, California) were performed at 2 min at 50\u00b0C, 10 min at 95\u00b0C, 40 cycles of 15 s at 95\u00b0C (denaturation) and 1 min at 60\u00b0C (annealing+extension) all the samples were run in duplicates along with the non-template control (NTC) a total of 60 samples of 12 tissue types from 5 adult buffaloes were included to identify panel of RGs for normalization of qPCR data across buffalo tissues. qPCR performance in terms of slope of five points standard curves was in the range of -3.138 to -3.646 and showed sufficiently good amplification efficiencies. overall expression stability criteria ranked RPS9 and UXT as most stable genes. the analysis thus classified GAPDH, 2M and RPS15 as less suitable RGs for calculation of normalization factor across 12 buffalo tissues. we used the lowest Vn/n+1 value (0.228) to determine the number of genes to be used to calculate normalization factor. the pairwise variation (V) analysis of candidate RGs for determining the optimal number of genes for normalization across 12 buffalo tissues. pairwise variation (V) analysis of 10 RGs was used to determine optimal number of reference genes for normalization of qPCR data in individual buffalo tissue.

RPL4 and RPS9, the two most stable genes identified across 12 tissues. gene expression stability was also evaluated using NormFinder tool for individual tissue type. the analysis showed almost similar ranking of RGs in individual tissue. NormFinder also accounted for inter and intra-group variation analysis. the gene expression variation based on Cq values for 10 candidate RGs was calculated using BestKeeper algorithm. the RPS9 gene with lowest crossing point SD value of 0.75 revealed minimum variation. the gene expression variation based on Cq values for 10 candidate RGs was calculated using BestKeeper algorithm. 28.20 26.11 27.97 Std dev [Cq] 1.13 1.11 0.97 1.22 1.89 0.97 0.75 1.34 1.63 0.95 CV [%Cq] 5.44 5.46 4.64 6.08 8.30 5.08 3.78 5.25 8.25 3.95 min [x-fold] -7.25 -5.78 -6.63 -11.64 -6.48 -3.18 -31.34 -21.09 -3.83 max [x-fold] 17.

UXT, RPS23, RPL4 and RPS9 were most stable and appropriate reference genes identified across buffalo tissues. their geometric means would provide accurate normalization factor for expression data in buffalo tissues."}
