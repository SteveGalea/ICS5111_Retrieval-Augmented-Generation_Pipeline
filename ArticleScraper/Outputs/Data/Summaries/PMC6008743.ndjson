{"summary": "Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging mosquito-borne flavivirus transmitted by different Aedes mosquito species, including Aedes aegypti. the virus has evolved into 3 distinct genotypes: West African (Nigerian cluster), East African (MR766 prototype cluster), and Asian [5]. a recent study on mammal cells demonstrated that ZIKV NS5 protein is able to activate IFN- in a selective manner while having an opposite effect on type I and III IFNs. this selective activation of IFN- signaling by ZIKV might also have an impact on other IFN-regulated immune functions, such as macrophage activation and Th1 response. PBMCs were obtained from healthy donors by density centrifugation. cultures were performed in RPMI 1640 medium (GIBCO, USA) containing 10% heat-inactivated FCS. PBMCs from 4 donors were used in the infection experiments. PBMCs were exposed to either MR766 or INMI1 for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C with different multiplicity of infection (MOI) at the end of the adsorption period, PBMCs were washed, reseeded at 2 106 cells/mL in RPMI 10% FCS. at 24, 48, and 72 hours postinfection, supernatants and cells were collected and stored at 80\u00b0C for subsequent analysis. supernatants were assayed by using multiplex bead-based assays. PBMCs treated with only medium were used for cytokine detection. titers were 107.37 TCID50/mL for MR766 and 106.12 TCID50/mL for INMI1. PBMCs from 4 donors were used in the infection experiments. IFN and Cytokines Detection IFN- and IFN- released in PBMC supernatants. detection range was 1.95\u2013125 pg/mL for IFN- and 62,50\u20134000 pg/mL. Statistical significance was assessed by Mann\u2013Whitney U test by using GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA) p 0.05 was considered statistically significant. supernatants of infected PBMC were collected at different hpi (24, 48, and 72), and production of different IFN types was assessed. only type II IFN (IFN-) showed a slight increase in response to INMI1 infection with a peak at 48 hpi. inflammatory (IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-), anti-inflammatory (IL4 and IL-10) and Th9 (IL-9) cytokines were evaluated in response to either ZIKV strain infection. a transient but not significant induction of IL-6 and TNF- was observed 48 hpi after INMI1 but not after MR766 exposure. supernatants of infected PBMC were collected at different hpi. no activation of either type I or III was observed after exposure to either ZIKV strains. the results of four independent experiments are expressed as pg/mL. Mann\u2013Whitney U test, p 0.05. even using higher MOI (1 and 10) to infect PBMC, neither evidence of viral replication nor induction of IFN system was observed. inflammatory (IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-), anti-inflammatory (IL4 and IL-10) and Th9 (IL-9) cytokines were evaluated in response to either ZIKV strain infection. no significant upregulation of IL-9 protein was observed after INMI1 and MR766 infections. innate host immune response developed in response to ZIKV infection in humans. limited and controversial information is available about the innate host immune response developed in response to ZIKV infection in humans. high levels of IL-6 and IL-8 are associated with severe/hemorrhagic infections. a coordinate balance between proinflammatory and regulatory signals represent the key for a protective immune response. IL-9 is a cytokine produced primarily by CD4+ Th9 cells. neither strain is able to activate an efficient IFN response, except for a poor activation of type II IFN by INMI1 strain. lack of activation of type I and III IFN response in PBMC may reflect an escape mechanism from the innate immune defense."}
