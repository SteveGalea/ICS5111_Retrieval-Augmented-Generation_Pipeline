{"summary": "as of November 4, 2015, WHO reported more than 28,000 cumulative cases and 11,000 deaths in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. as the emergency progressed, researchers developed mathematical models of the epidemiological dynamics. the prominence of recent EVD work enabled by existing research programs for infectious disease modeling. in 15 publications); phylogenetics of EVD viruses (in 9 publications); and feasibility of conducting vaccine trials in West Africa (in 2 publications). date of latest EVD data Date published EVD data was pre-existing and public Uncertainties addressed R Interventions Forecast Spread. al., 2015 8/29/14 4/23/15 Yes * * Althaus, 2015 8/31/14 4/19/15 Yes * * Scarpino et al., 2014 8/31/14 12/15/14 Yes * * Drake et al., 2015 9/2/14 10/30/14 Yes * * Towers et al., 2014 9/8/14 9/18/14 Yes * Bellan et al., 2014 9/14/14 10/14/14 Yes * Cooper /14 4/28/15 Yes * * Kiskowski, 2014 10/15/14 11/13/14 Yes * * Althaus et al., 2014 10/20/14 11/21/14 Yes * * Simon-Loriere et al., 2015 10/20/14 11/21/14 1/15/15 Yes * * Simon-Loriere et al., 2015 10/20/14 6/24/15 No * Rainisch et al., 2015 10/31/14 6/24/15 No * number of publications with models to estimate R increased rapidly early in the epidemic, along with those including intervention, forecasting, and regional and international spread models. growth rate of publications with phylogenetic modeling applications increased later in the epidemic. some studies incorporated spatial data on EVD cases into models of regional EVD spread. 9 of the 12 studies that collected original EVD data released those data before or at the time of publication. all phylogenetic studies published after release of the initial Ebola virus sequences by (Baize et al., 2014) (Guinea) and (Gire et al., 2014) (Sierra Leone) incorporated those sequence data. publication lag was almost 3 months (median [interquartile range] = 85 [30\u2013157] days) the figure excludes an outlier estimate of 8.33 for Sierra Leone. 16 country-specific estimates of R0 provided 95% confidence or credible intervals. median CI width was about 85% smaller for models that used cumulative EVD counts (N=11 models in 5 publications) 'Dampening' refers to various approaches to restrict the growth of forecasted incidence over time. the figure excludes one forecast with horizon > 1 year. forecast error was lower for forecasts made later in the outbreak. date of latest EVD data Date published EVD data was pre-existing and public Uncertainties addressed R Interventions Forecast Spread Phylogenetics Clinical trials. /30/14 Yes * * * * Bellan et al., 2014 9/8/14 9/18/14 Yes * * Chowell et al., 2015 9/14/14 1/19/15 Yes * Cooper et al., 2015 9/14/14 4/14/15 Yes * * Read et al., 2015 9/14/14 11/12/14 Yes * * * Faye et al., 2015 9/16/14 1/23/15 No * * Bogoch 25/14 6/24/15 No * Rainisch et al., 2015 10/31/14 6/16/15 Yes * Fast et al., 2015 11/1/14 5/15/15 Yes * * Tong et al., 2015 11/1/14 2/18/15 No * Hoenen et al., 2015 11/11/14 5/13/15 No * Cope et al., 2014 12/3/14 12/10/14 No * Chowell et al., 2014 12/3 the figure includes 125 modeling applications across the 66 publications. 74% included mechanistic assumptions about disease transmission. 26% were purely phenomenological. data and results sharing Of the 12 studies that collected original EVD data, 9 released those data before or at the time of publication. many publications used results from the WHO Ebola Response Team investigations (WHO Ebola Response Team, 2014; 2015) but the detailed epidemiological data from these studies, to date, are not publicly available. publication lag was almost 3 months (median [interquartile range] = 85 [30\u2013157] days) lag varied across modeling applications, and was considerably shorter in studies that included models to estimate R (median = 58 days for publications with R estimation versus 118 days for others) ia, or Sierra Leone that provided 95% confidence or credible intervals (CIs) median CI width was about 85% smaller for models that used cumulative EVD counts (N=11 models in 5 publications) than for models that used disaggregated EVD case data, such as weekly counts (N=5 models in 3 publications) forecast error was lower for forecasts made later in the outbreak (14% reduction in mean absolute percentage error [MAPE] per week, P0.001), higher for forecasts with longer time horizons (29% increase in MAPE per week, P0.01) and lower for forecasts that used decay terms, spatially heterogeneous contact patterns, or other methods that served to constrain projected incidence growth (90% reduction in MAPE, P0.01) ebola outbreak in west africa clearly highlights need for better understanding of how increasing awareness of severe infections within a community decreases their transmissibility even in the absence of specific interventions. modeling coordination could facilitate direct comparison of modeling results, identifying issues on which diverse approaches agree and areas of greater uncertainty. modelers and other analysts expended enormous effort during EVD epidemic transcribing data posted online in pdf documents. new norms for data-sharing during public health emergencies would remove most obvious hurdle for model comparison. new norms for data-sharing during public health emergencies would remove most obvious hurdle for model comparison. we excluded studies of clinical prediction models, viral or physiological function models, ecological niche models, animal reservoir models. for included publications, we recorded the geographic settings, date of most recent EVD data used and date of publication, type of EVD data used, questions the models addressed, modeling approaches, and key results. to assess forecast accuracy, we compared predictions of models made under \u2018status quo\u2019 assumptions. 186-supp3.zip (1.3KB, zip) DOI: 10.7554/eLife.09186.013 Supplementary file 4."}
