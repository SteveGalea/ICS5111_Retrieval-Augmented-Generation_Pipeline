GAAP ion channel activity, a core function GAAP is predominantly a Golgi-resident protein [2]. this was demonstrated first with anti-GAAP antibody and immuno-electron microscopy. as GAAP concentration increases during ectopic expression, hGAAP and vGAAPs become detectable in the ER, presumably because of overexpression and Golgi saturation [2]. mutation of the equivalent residue in hBI-1 (D213 in hBI-1) attenuates the ability of BI-1 to reduce the Ca2+ content of the ER. this suggests that the ion channel activity of GAAPs may constitute the core function from which cell adhesion, migration and apoptotic protection are regulated. oligomerization of vGAAP and hGAAP is dependent on pH, with a more alkaline pH favouring oligomerization. vGAAP double cysteine mutant (C9S/C60SvGAAP) was unable to oligomerize in native Golgi membranes of live cells. this mutant retained its anti-apoptotic activity and its effect on intracellular Ca2+ stores. a BI-1 C-terminal peptide lacks all the regions identified in hGAAP that are required for oligomerization. a possible hetero-oligomerization of different members of the TMBIM family could be relevant for TMBIM activity or regulation. simplest of all known prokaryotic and eukaryotic channels consists of two transmembrane segments (2TM) separated by a selectivity filter and pore-forming loop known as the P-region. the structure has been expanded with the addition of four transmembrane segments (figure 3, blue) to form the 6TM arrangement (named S1\u2013S6) of most eukaryotic channels. phylogenomic evidence that some viral genes, including viral K+ channel-encoding genes, did not originate from their hosts has highlighted the importance of including viral ion channels in these evolutionary analyses. this is particularly relevant to large algae-infecting viruses such as chloroviruses, which lack aa similarity between viral and host proteins or of close orthologues. the 97 aa M2 protein contains a single TM [92] that assembles into a homo-tetrameric H+-permeable pore important for viral entry. another example is the 94 aa viral K+ channel, Kcv, from chlorella virus 1 (Paramecium bursaria Chlorella virus 1, PBCV-1) that resembles the 2TM bacterial channels Kir and KcsA. members of subclass A have lumenal N and C termini. members of subclass B have cytosolic N and C termini. an additional class (III) is proposed for viral pores containing 6\u20137 transmembrane domains. it is possible that attaching a tag such as the hemagglutinin epitope at the C terminus of GAAPs induced an aberrant topology. it is also possible that the C terminus of GAAP is in equilibrium between two states, one of which is favoured by the addition of a C-terminal tag and the other by the crystallization conditions used to solve the structure of BsYetJ. GAAPs present a novel type or sub-type of ion channel structure. the majority of viroporins have been associated with viral entry, assembly or release. the majority of viroporins have been associated with viral entry, assembly or release [99] and serve as ideal anti-viral drug targets. hGAAPs and hBI-1 inhibit apoptosis, increase cell spreading and migration speed and reduce the Ca2+ content of intracellular stores. mutation of the equivalent residue in hBI-1 (D213 in hBI-1) attenuates the ability of BI-1 to reduce the Ca2+ content of the ER. GAAPs lack signature motifs related to selectivity or conductance. oligomerization plays an important role in the regulation of ion flux or channel conductance. oligomerization (homo or hetero) plays an important role in the regulation of ion flux or channel conductance. no monomeric BI-1 mutant is available to test if oligomerization is essential for its ion channel function. oligomerization is at least partially pH-dependent, suggesting a different oligomerization mechanism for hGAAP that is independent of cysteines. BI-1 and GAAP oligomerization are at least partially pH-dependent. GAAP topology is unique among mammalian and viral ion channels. simplest of all known prokaryotic and eukaryotic channels consists of two transmembrane segments (2TM) (figure 3, green), separated by a selectivity filter and pore-forming loop known as the P-region. the presumed precursor (green) consists of two transmembrane regions (2TM) separated by a pore-forming loop (P) which is common to all K+ channels. other ion channels are thought to have arisen from the combination of duplication events such as 2*2TM, and the addition of TMDs to the minimal 2TM structure, such as 6TM. oviruses-encoded K+ channels have been hypothesized as the closest channels to the evolutionary ancestor of all K+ channel proteins. the first described viral ion channel is the M2 protein from influenza virus A. other ion channels have been discovered and are grouped within a family of viral ion channels known as viroporins. topology-based classification of viroporins/viral ion channels. viroporins contain proteins with a single transmembrane domain. members of subclass A have lumenal N and cytosolic C terminus. us of GAAP indicated that GAAPs have both the N and C termini in the cytosol, 6 TMDs and an additional C-terminal hydrophobic region or loop. it is possible that attaching a tag such as the hemagglutinin epitope, despite being short (9 aa), at the C terminus of GAAPs induced an aberrant topology. topological data suggest that the C-terminal hydrophobic loop probably lines the channel pore (figure 2). GAAPs differ from the 6TM consensus of K+ channels, in that the pore region of GAAPs is shifted further towards the C terminus (figure 3). the crystal structure of BsYetJ is structurally different to any known ion channel. a range of mutations were introduced to alter GAAP localization. however, this has only yielded inconclusive results. compared with other TMBIM members, GAAP is the broadest anti-apoptotic inhibitor. overexpression of vGAAP and hGAAP increases cell migration, adhesion and spreading phenotypes. calpain 2 accelerates the turnover of focal adhesions thereby contributing to the observed increased cell migration, adhesion and spreading phenotypes [7]. the detailed mechanism by which GAAP stimulates SOCE remains unclear. two other members of the TMBIM family can also affect cellular mechanisms involved in cell migration and adhesion. BI-1 overexpression induces cell migration by directly interacting with actin and by promoting actin polymerization [25], suggesting a possible link with cytoskeletal remodelling. the importance of GAAP for cell viability increases the likelihood of lethality in vivo. the exact role for GAAP during poxvirus infection remains unclear. the exact role for GAAP during poxvirus infection remains unclear. hGAAP can protect cells from apoptosis, promote cell viability, and upregulate cell adhesion and migration. anti-apoptotic genes are important contributors of cancer progression. significant upregulation of hGAAP mRNA has been detected in brain and lung tumours. 2/LFG/TMBIM2 overexpression also correlates with high primary breast tumours grades [38] and low LFG levels correlate with poor overall survival of NBL patients [36]. the oncomine cancer microarray database was used to assess the dysregulation of hGAAP expression. work in G.L.S.'s laboratory was funded by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology."}
