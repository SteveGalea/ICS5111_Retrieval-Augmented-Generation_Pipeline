{"summary": "despite their ubiquity, there is a lack of interdisciplinary epidemiologic and economic research that has collected primary impact data from families during ARIs in children. despite their ubiquity, there is a lack of interdisciplinary epidemiologic and economic research that has collected primary impact data associated with indirect costs. the most studied of all respiratory viruses, cost-of-illness and vaccine cost-effectiveness evaluations in children have tended to rely on assumptions or use retrospectively collected estimates for resource utilisation. there are three pieces of evidence required by those developing health policy in assessing whether to recommend or implement a publicly-funded vaccination program against respiratory viruses. maternal and child health nurses (MCHNs) provide support to families during the early childhood years, particularly on issues to do with general health and vaccination. advertising material for the study was placed in child care and playgroup centers and because of proximity, we also used bulletin boards and staff e-mail lists. an ARI of interest required one category A or two category B symptoms on a single day. no illness or symptom details, including a report of otitis media, were validated by study staff or health care professionals. an ARI could not commence unless there were three symptom free days since the end of the previous ARI. a summary impact diary was used to collect details of resources used during the study child's ARI. the average total cost for these items in the pilot study was AUD$16 per ARI. the average total cost for these items was AUD$16 per ARI. Applied costs were retrieved, where possible, from published sources. the proportions of time away from work seeking healthcare or time away from work caring for an ill child were not collected, and these values have been derived from the same proportions in the pilot study, based on 202 illnesses. 10 visits $15.63 per visit to allied and alternative health professionals Hospital emergency

earnings for all reported times. data were analysed using Stata 9.2 for Windows (StataCorp, Texas, USA) the study cohort consisted of one healthy child less than five years of age at time of recruitment from each study family. an ARI of interest required one category A or two category B symptoms on a single day. a new ARI could not commence unless there were three symptom free days since the end of the previous ARI. a new ARI could contain no more than two consecutive symptom-free days. the NTS was couriered to the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory (VIDRL) it was tested for a number of common respiratory viruses using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method for adenoviruses and reverse transcription (RT) PCR for RNA viruses: influenza A virus, influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses I, II, and III (PIVs) and picornaviruses. time was recorded as a total value for the ARI in two categories: time away from work and time away from usual, non-work activities. costing methods All costs were incurred over a 380 day period between 17 January 2003 and 31 January 2004. general practitioners January to March 2003: $4.03

contributed the most person-time to the study (28% of all child-days) there were five illnesses which involved a hospital admission, all with an impact diary available. the mean cost of these five illnesses, including the cost of admission, was $3,409 (95% CI $2,798 to $4,020) adenoviruses 17 (3.3%) $4,212 $248 $140 to $356 $185 $90, $341 PIVsc 21 (4.0%) $4,804 $229 $104 to $354 $112 $84, $291 hMPVd 15 (2.9%) $3,284 $219 $109 to $328 $204 $57, $324 Co-identifications 51 (9.8%) $17,503 $343 $212 to $475 $185 $72, $431 No virus identified 126 144 ARIs from band 2 (0.37 ARIs per child-month) had a mean cost $375 (95% CI $244 to $506), 110 ARIs from band 3 (0.44 ARIs per child-month) with mean cost $366 (95% CI $282 to $451), and 148 ARIs from band 4 (0.43 ARIs per child-month) with mean cost $272 (95% CI $208 to $337) za single virus ARIs averaged $706 per ARI for influenza A. the cost of excess carer time away from a usual activity averaged $706 per ARI. compared with $164 and 62% for other single virus illnesses. cost for all illnesses was $19 (6%) met by the healthcare sector, $245 (79%) by the patient and family sector, and $45 (15%) met by employers paying for an employee who was seeking healthcare for or caring for an ill child. the equivalent values for influenza A infections are: $36 (4%), $780 (86%), and $87 (10%). the cost of community-managed ARIs in healthy preschool-aged children fell within a relatively narrow $85 range. despite overlapping confidence intervals, the finding of most note in this study was the dramatically higher point estimate of the mean cost of influenza A ARIs. studies show children have comparatively higher rates of influenza infection. impact data from this study may be transferable to other countries with developed economies. despite lower mean costs than influenza illnesses, the importance of working towards the prevention of other respiratory viral infections is obvious. 74% of all specimens collected from children in this study were positive for at least one virus is within the range of values from recent home visit studies. some issues about the cost of illnesses caused by respiratory viruses in children unresolved by our study. study only captured information from a single season with higher than normal influenza activity with H3N2 influenza A (drifted strain subtype A/Fujian/411/2002-like) being the predominant circulating type. variable incidence and severity year-by-year for all respiratory viruses make it difficult to directly translate our findings to other years. despite the impact of respiratory viral infections in children there are relatively few burden comparisons available that collect primary data from ill children. an italian study examining the impact of hMPV, RSV, and influenza in children less than 15-years of age presenting to an emergency department found hMPV illnesses to be significantly more burdensome than RSV. st it used laboratory confirmation, it did not employ more sensitive molecular diagnostics, and the study did not provide a comparison with other viral acute respiratory illnesses. findings reinforce the need to follow children for ARIs over more than one season, with different rates of influenza infection from year-to-year in each age group. cost benefits of preventing influenza in children would extend beyond target age-group [58] similar to indirect effects in older age groups seen following introduction of childhood conjugate pneumococcal vaccination in the us [59] study reinforces cost of all respiratory viruses, but particularly interpandemic influenza, on children, their families, and society.
