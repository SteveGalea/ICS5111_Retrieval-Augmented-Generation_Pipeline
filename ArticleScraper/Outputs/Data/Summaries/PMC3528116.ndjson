(Beijing, China) the chickens were 14 days old, the average maternal ND antibody titer was 4.6 log 2, the IB antibody titer was 3.8 log 2, the AI antibody titer was 4.3 log 2, and the average body weight was 232 g. the chickens were subcutaneously injected with the vaccines containing 10, 30 or 50 mg/mL of the SPP adjuvant, the oil adjuvant (OA), or physiological concentrations of saline. ter Assay On days 7, 14, 21, and 28, after vaccination, 10 chickens were sampled randomly from each group for the determination of AI-HI antibody titer. 6 chickens were used to determine the proliferation of peripheral lymphocytes using the MTT assay [27] FITC-labeled rat anti-chicken CD3 (10 L) and PE-labeled rat anti-chicken CD4 (10 L) were added to one sample, FITC-labeled rat anti-chicken CD3 (10 L) and PE-labeled rat anti-chicken CD8a (10 L) were added to a second sample, and FITC-labeled rat anti-chicken IgGl (10 L) and PE-labeled polysaccharides in the Sargassum pallidum include outermost skeleton polysaccharide, the intercellular mucopolysaccharide and storage polysaccharides in protoplasts. the net polysaccharide content was 81.2%, as measured using pyrogen test. the vaccines were produced by mixing the vaccines with three different concentrations of SPP. the non-adjuvant vaccine was produced by diluting the vaccines with PBS. the oil adjuvant vaccine was produced by emulsifying the vaccines with white oil. rat anti-chicken CD3, PE-labeled rat anti-chicken CD4, PE-labeled rat anti-chicken CD8a, FITC-labeled rat anti-chicken IgGl, and PE-labeled rat anti-chicken IgGl monoclonal antibodies were obtained from the Jingmei Biotech Co., Ltd. serial dilutions (2-fold) of serum were placed in the bottom 96-well microtiter plate. the serum dilutions ranged from 1:2 to 1:2048. the control wells were positive for serum, negative for serum, contained erythrocytes, or contained antigens. bottom 96-well microtiter plate containing 25 L of CMF-PBS in each well. next, 25 L of a 1% rooster erythrocyte suspension was added to each well. control wells were positive for serum, negative for serum, contained erythrocytes, or contained antigens. the resulting pellet was re-suspended at 5.0 106 cells/mL. cells were added to 96-well flat-bottomed cell culture plates. each sample was prepared in triplicate. cells grown without ConA were used as the negative control. FITC-labeled rat anti-chicken CD3 (10 L) and PE-labeled rat anti-chicken CD8a (10 L) were added to a second sample. FITC-labeled rat anti-chicken CD3 (10 L) and PE-labeled rat anti-chicken CD8a (10 L) were added to the control sample. high doses of polysaccharide to vaccines increases the volume of the vaccine at the injection site. the main function of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes is the secretion of cell factors that induce and enhance the immune response. when the CD4+/CD8+ ratio is high, the body has a high immune status. the results of this study show that the appropriate dose of polysaccharide significantly enhances the specific immune response in chickens. the appropriate dose of polysaccharide can promote the proliferation of peripheral CD4+ T lymphocytes in chickens, thus enhancing cellular immunity."}
