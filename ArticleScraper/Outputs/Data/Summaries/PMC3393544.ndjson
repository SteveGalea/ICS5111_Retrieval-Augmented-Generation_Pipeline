{"summary": "all IFN-Is bind to a common heterodimeric cell surface receptor. Activated STAT1 and STAT2 form a trimolecular complex with interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) binding of IFN- to its unique receptor results in the formation of STAT1 homodimers. IFN-I, as well as IFN-II, can activate additional signaling pathways (reviewed in references 41 and 99) however, the nature of these pathways and their biological significance is not yet well understood. LCMV is a rare cause of meningoencephalitis in adults and fetuses. lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) is characterized by seizures and mononuclear cell infiltrates in the meninges and choroid plexus (4, 12) the development of LCM is dependent on CD8+ effector T cells (12, 24, 29\u201331, 37, 79) but does not require CD4+ T helper cells (24, 58) following peripheral infection, LCMV is cleared within 10 to 12 days postinfection despite the central roles of STAT1, STAT2 and IRF9 in IFN-I signaling, there has been only limited investigation of the roles that these factors play in LCMV infection. however, further studies are needed to clarify the role of IFN-III in the disease. STAT1 KO mice (33) were provided originally by Joan Durbin, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH. IRF9 KO mice (54) were obtained from Riken Bioresource Center, Japan. IFN- receptor-deficient mice (48) were purchased from Jackson Laboratories. tissue sections (5 m) were prepared and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. the primary antibodies used were against CD4, CD8 (1:50 dilution; BD Pharmingen, Ryde, Australia), 7/4 (1:50 dilution; Serotec, Raleigh, NC) serum (3 independent samples per genotype and condition) was diluted 1:3 in mouse serum diluent (Bio-Rad) and incubated with antibody-coupled beads. then biotinylated antibody followed by incubation with streptavidin-phycoerythrin (PE) total RNA was isolated from snap-frozen tissue using TriReagent (Sigma-Aldrich, Castle Hill, Australia) according to manufacturer's instructions. serial dilutions (1:10, 1:100, and 1:1,000) were made with PBS. the medium was removed from the Vero cells, and 200 l of diluted tissue lysate was added to each well. a serial dilution from 108 to 100 PFU/ml of LCMV was used as a positive control. mice were injected i.p. with 200 l of either anti-CD4 or anti-CD8 neutralizing antibody solution. erythrocytes were lysed using erythrocyte lysis buffer (Invitrogen) mice were perfused with PBS, and the liver was removed. the samples were analyzed using a BD FACSAria (BD Pharmingen) and FlowJo (Ashland, OR) software. Isolation of leukocytes from lymph nodes and tetramer stain. at day 6 postinfection, WT and STAT1 KO mice were euthanized. STAT1 KO mice (33) were provided originally by Joan Durbin, Columbus, OH. IRF9 KO mice (54) were obtained from Riken Bioresource Center, Japan. IFN- receptor-deficient mice (48) were purchased from Jackson Laboratories. tissue sections (5 m) were prepared and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for immunohistochemistry, tissue was embedded in Tissue Tek (Sakura Finetek, Zoeterwoude, Netherlands) and snap-frozen in liquid-nitrogen-cooled isopentane. the samples were analyzed using a Luminex 100 system (Bio-Rad) and Bio-Plex Manager software (Bio-Rad) a significant increase or decrease in the level of a particular cytokine was present if the mean of the values of the samples from infected mice showed at least a 2-fold change compared with the uninfected samples. a serial dilution from 108 to 100 PFU/ml of LCMV was used as a positive control. after 1 h of incubation at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 the lysate was removed. 2% carboxymethyl cellulose (Sigma-Aldrich) mixed 1:1 with 2 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% FBS was layered on top of the cells. in vivo depletion was confirmed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis. erythrocytes were lysed using erythrocyte lysis buffer (Invitrogen) the cells were then blocked with CD16/CD32 and stained for CD4 (anti-CD4\u2013fluorescein isothiocyanate [FITC] and CD8 (APC) the samples were analyzed using a BD FACSAria (BD Pharmingen) and FlowJo (Ashland, OR) software. at day 6 postinfection, WT and STAT1 KO mice were euthanized. the lymph nodes were dispersed and passed through a 70-m cell strainer. MV-Arm resulted in a characteristic neurological disease with convulsive seizures and death between 7 and 9 days postinfection. in contrast, only mild clinical signs, such as reduced activity, were observed in WT mice following i.p. infection. STAT2 KO and IRF9 KO mice developed mild clinical signs following i.c. infection and survived. i.p. infection of STAT1 KO mice resulted in mild clinical signs, and none of the mice died. mice developed moderate clinical signs that were indistinguishable from those seen in similarly infected IRF9 KO or STAT2 KO mice. this demonstrated that the combined loss of IFN-I and IFN-II signaling per se could not produce the effect of STAT1 deficiency on clinical disease. STAT1 and IRF9 KO mice infected i.p. had low levels of LCMV-NP RNA in the liver at days 3 and 6 postinfection and in the kidney at days 6 and 12 postinfection. no viral RNA was detectable in the central nervous system (CNS) increased LCMV RNA levels in STAT1 KO mice correlate with increased virus load. liver lysates from uninfected and day 3 and day 6 infected WT and STAT1 KO mice did not contain detectable levels of virus. a high virus titer was found for liver lysates from infected STAT1 KO mice. at day 6 postinfection, the livers, kidneys, and lungs of infected mice showed scattered inflammatory foci. however, the overall tissue architecture was preserved, and no necrosis was present. at day 6 postinfection, large numbers of leukocytes were present in the livers, kidneys, and lungs of infected STAT1 KO mice. the livers (B), kidneys (F), lungs (K), and spleens (O) showed prominent mononuclear infiltrates. no organized germinal centers were seen in the spleens (P) of infected STAT1 KO mice. at day 6 postinfection, the livers (Fig. 4E to H) and kidneys of WT mice showed a moderate increase in infiltrating CD4+ (Fig. 4E and Q) and CD8+ (Fig. 4F and R) T cells, macrophages (Fig. 4G and S), and neutrophils (Fig. 4H and T) were present in the livers and kidneys of LCMV-infected STAT1 KO mice at day 6 postin livers of infected STAT1 KO mice showed a moderate increase in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, neutrophils, and monocytes/macrophages (CD45+, Ly6G+, and CD11b+) at day 6 postinfection, the livers of infected mice showed a moderate increase in CD4+ T cells and macrophage numbers. large numbers of CD4+ (A) and CD8+ (C) T cells, neutrophils (E) and macrophages (G) infiltrated the liver in STAT1 KO mice following infection. notably, neutrophils were the most frequent cell type, followed by macrophages and CD8+ T cells. in infected IRF9 KO mice, several cytokine mRNA levels were increased compared with uninfected controls. TNF and TGF- mRNA levels were increased at days 3, 6, and 12 postinfection. IL-23 p19 mRNA levels were increased at days 3 and 6 postinfection. upregulation of various proinflammatory and counterinflammatory cytokine genes in the livers of LCMV-infected mice. the values were normalized to the housekeeping gene L32. s in IRF9 KO and STAT1 KO mice compared with WT mice suggests IFN-I signaling is important for moderating the early innate antiviral response. results highlight exaggerated expression of a number of cytokine genes, including IFN-, IL-6, and IL-10, in the early phase following LCMV infection. CCL2, CCL4, G-CSF, and IL-10 remained significantly increased compared with uninfected mice. at day 6 postinfection, IL-2, IL-3, and IL-9 were increased significantly in STAT1 KO mice compared with uninfected mice. the sera of STAT1 KO mice contained significantly higher levels of CCL4, G-CSF, IL-6, CCL2, IL-10, IL-5, IFN-, and IL-12 p70. at day 6 postinfection, CCL4, G-CSF, IL-6, CCL2, IL-10, IL-5, IL-3, IL-9, and IL-2 were significantly elevated in the sera of LCMV-infected STAT1 KO mice IL\u20135 7.0 0.4 5.9 0.4 (1.2) 28 2.3 (4.0) 7.25 0.8 37 1.5 (5.1) 65 7.6 (9.0) IL\u20136 8.7 2.0 5.7 0.2 (1.5) 8.9 1.8 (1.0) 5.8 1.6 127 18.0 (21.9) 191 24.1 (32.9) IL\u20139 21 4.5 14 0.7 (1.5) 13 1.7 (1.6) 13 1.3 23 1.0 (1.8) 32 5.6 (2.5) IL\u2013 11 0.9 (1.8) 12 0.8 (1.7) 13 2.6 8 1.6 (1.7) 9 0.9 (1.4) CCL11 294 9.3 177 11.3 (1.7) 265 9.4 (1.1) 184 12.4 340 28.5 (1.9) 195 21.6 (1.1) G\u2013CSF 9.6 0.4 18 2.2 (1.9) 81 5.4 (8.4) 11 1.7 432 66.9 (40.3) 195 28.8 (18) GMc\u2013CSF 30 STAT1 KO mice have increased percentages of LCMV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. LCMV infection did not result in a significant increase in CD4+ T cells that recognized the LCMV-specific tetramer at day 6 postinfection. in STAT1 KO mice, infection with LCMV resulted in a significant early expansion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that are specific for LCMV. compared with uninfected mice, STAT1 deficiency resulted in a significant early expansion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that are specific for LCMV. LCMV in adult mice infected i.c. or i.p. is mediated by antiviral CD8+ cells. LCMV-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells play a role in the lethal disease in LCMV-infected STAT1 KO mice by depleting these cells following administration of specific neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. spontaneous activity and ruffled fur around days 7 to 9 postinfection. nondepleted and CD4+ T-cell-depleted LCMV-infected STAT1 KO mice showed similar loss of body weight. CD4+ T cells are required for lethal disease in LCMV-infected STAT1 KO mice. the livers, kidneys, and lungs of STAT1 KO mice infected i.p. with LCMV showed extensive leukocyte infiltration and concomitant tissue destruction. CD4+ T cells mediate the severe tissue immunopathology and death, but not weight loss, observed in STAT1-deficient mice. i.p. infection of STAT1 KO mice resulted in 100% lethality after 8 to 12 days. weight loss in STAT1 KO mice started at around day 3 postinfection. weight loss was significantly greater in STAT1 KO mice than in IRF9 KO mice. the data are shown as means standard errors of the mean. STAT1 has a key role in both IFN-I and IFN-II signaling. LCMV infection was not lethal in IRF9 KO IFNGR KO mice. low levels of LCMV-NP RNA were present in the liver at day 3 and day 6 postinfection and in the kidney at day 6 and day 12 postinfection. LCMV-NP RNA was present in the livers of infected IFNGR KO mice at day 6 and day 12 postinfection. however, viral clearance from the livers of infected IFNGR KO mice was delayed. plaque assays performed on liver lysates from uninfected and day 3 infected WT and STAT1 KO mice showed no infectious virus detectable by the assay. a high virus titer was present in the livers of day 3 and day 6 infected STAT1 KO mice. infection of STAT1 KO mice with LCMV results in severe tissue immunopathology. histological examination was performed on various organs from WT, IFNGR KO, STAT2 KO, IRF9 KO, and STAT1 KO mice infected i.p. with LCMV. organs from LCMV-infected IFNGR KO mice at day 6 postinfection showed no overt pathological changes compared with sham-inf LCMV infection of STAT1 KO mice results in destructive organ pathology. livers (B), kidneys (F), lungs (K) and spleens (O) showed no overt pathological alterations. spleens (P) of infected STAT1 KO mice showed prominent mononuclear infiltrates. morphonuclear granulocytes (arrows), as well as focal necrosis, in liver (T, arrows) and kidney (U, arrows; note the normal glomerulus in top left corner) immunohistochemistry was performed on liver and kidney tissue sections. in the livers and kidneys of sham-infected STAT1 KO mice, only a few CD4+ (Fig. 4A and M) and CD8+ (Fig. 4B sham-infected STAT1 KO mice showed low numbers of CD4+ T cells (A and M), CD8+ T cells (B and N), macrophages (C and O), and neutrophils (D and P) were present in the liver and kidney, respectively. at day 6 postinfection, few infiltrating CD4+ (E and Q) and CD8+ (F and R) T cells, macrophages (G and S), and neutrophils (H the numbers and percentages of live cells also increased for CD8+ T cells, neutrophils, and macrophages. in contrast, large numbers of CD4+ (A) and CD8+ (C) T cells, neutrophils (E) and macrophages (G) infected livers of infected mice. in uninfected WT, IRF9 KO, and STAT1 KO mice, the mRNA levels for all cytokines analyzed were similar. the levels of TNF mRNA were significantly lower in STAT1 KO mice than in WT mice. TNF, IL-1, IL-1, and IL-10 mRNA levels were significantly higher in IRF9 KO mice in this early phase than in WT mice. findings suggest dysregulation of the antiviral immune response in IRF9 KO mice that affects both the early and later phases of infection. in infected IRF9 KO mice, IFN-, IL-6, and IL-10 mRNA levels were reduced significantly compared with day 3 postinfection. independent of the mouse genotype, no changes were observed in the lymphotoxin, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, and IL-5 mRNA levels following i.p. infection with LCMV. CCL2, CXCL1, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and IL-5 were increased significantly in the sera of infected STAT1 KO mice. at day 3 postinfection, only CCL2 and CCL4 showed a significant increase in WT mice, while IL-2 was significantly reduced. several cytokines are increased significantly in the sera of infected STAT1 KO mice. at day 6 postinfection, CCL4, G-CSF, IL-6, CCL2, IL-10, IL-5, IFN-, and IL-12 p70 were significantly elevated. chemokine Level (pg/ml) SEM (fold change)a WT STAT1 KO 0b 3 6 0 3 6 IL\u20131 17 1.0 12 1.3 (1.4) 15 0.6 (1.2) 15 0.9 17 1.2 (1.5) IL\u20131 56 9.6 37 1.3 (0.7) 39 1.9 (1.4) 35 5.9 46 2.6 (1.3) 40 0.9 (1.1) IL\u20132 3.3 0.7 1.1 0.3 (2.9) 2.7 49 6.0 (1.8) 27 3.8 (1.0) 16 2.6 104 7.7 (6.4) 70 6.9 (4.3) IL\u201312p40 47 2.2 73 3.7 (1.6) 72 5.0 (1.5) 33 2.1 59 9.2 (1.8) 55 7.0 (1.7) IL\u201312p70 21 2.7 12 4.0 (1.8) 3.8 1.3 (5.7) 12 3.5 26 2.1 (2.2) 18 1.8 (1.4) IL\u201313 42 4.3 24 STAT1 KO mice have increased percentages of LCMV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. we analyzed for the presence of LCMV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that recognized MHC class II or MHC class I peptides. LCMV infection did not result in a significant increase in CD4+ T cells that recognized the LCMV-specific tetramer at day 6 postinfection. in infected STAT1 KO mice at day 6 postinfection, there was a significant increase in CD4+ T cells that recognized the LCMV-specific tetramer. significantly more CD4+ T cells from infected STAT1 KO mice bound the LCMV GP66-77 MHC class II tetramer than uninfected mice. the lethal disease caused by LCMV infection of STAT1 KO mice is mediated by CD4+ and not CD8+ T cells. mice infected i.c. prevented lethal LCM. depletion of CD8+ T cells in STAT1 KO mice infected i.p. or i.c. with LCMV delayed significantly, but did not prevent lethal disease. however, depletion of CD4+ T cells in STAT1 KO mice infected i.p. or i.c. with LCMV resulted in complete protection from lethal disease. depletion of CD8+ T cells significantly increased survival time of STAT1 KO mice infected i.p. with LCMV but did not prevent lethal disease. in similarly infected STAT1 KO mice that were depleted of CD4+ T cells, the livers (I), kidneys (J) and lungs (K) showed only minor mononuclear infiltrates. the effects of STAT1 deficiency on the outcome of LCMV infection are distinct from either STAT2 or IRF9 deficiency. despite increased innate immune responses, all three IFN-I signaling-deficient mice failed to control infection and developed signs of disease. but only LCMV infection of mice deficient for STAT1 caused lethal disease that was associated with widely disseminated tissue immune pathology. KO mice, as well as IRF9 KO IFNGR KO mice, are concordant with previous observations reported for IFNAR-deficient mice (74, 83) and IFNAR IFNGR double-deficient mice (100) LCMV infection in infected STAT1 KO mice was not totally innocuous. the distinctiveness of the immune response in STAT1 KO mice compared with IRF9 KO mice is further evident from the qualitative differences in cytokine expression. the differences in cytokine expression might contribute to the death or survival of STAT1 KO and IRF9 KO mice, respectively, remains to be lucidated. infection of mice with LCMV clone 13 causes functional exhaustion of CD8+ T cells mediated by coinhibitory T-cell receptors, such as PD-1 and LAG3 (13, 18) or the cytokine IL-10 (35), resulting in viral persistence. absence of significantly increased tissue IL-10 mRNA levels in LCMV-infected IRF9 KO mice argues against a role for IL-10 in the ineffective immune response in these regulatory T cells have been identified as important in preventing the development of pathogenic CD4+ T-cell responses. failure to generate these cells could account for the destructive T-cell response. the role of STAT1 in the development of regulatory T cells is unclear. tissue IL-17 mRNA levels were increased in both STAT1 and IRF9 KO mice infected with LCMV. this suggests activation of the CD4+ Th17 lineage might occur as a more general response to the absence of IFN-I signaling."}
