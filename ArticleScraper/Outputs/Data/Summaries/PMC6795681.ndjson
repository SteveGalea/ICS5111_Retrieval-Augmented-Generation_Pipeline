{"summary": "post-infectious bronchiolitis obliterans (PIBO) is associated with chronic inflammatory and fibrotic lesions of small airways leading to chronic airflow obstruction. treatment is generally supportive therapy and frequently includes glucocorticoids (4\u20136) in dogs, severe damage to the lung can lead to end-stage and untreatable fibrosis. a blind bronchoalveolar lavage showed numerous intra- and extracellular bacteria consistent with septic suppurative pneumonia. a respiratory polymerase chain reaction assay on an endotracheal tube swab was negative for Bordetella bronchiseptica, Influenza A virus, adenovirus-2, distemper, herpesvirus, parainfluenza, respiratory coronavirus. repeated BAL revealed predominantly degenerate neutrophils and numerous extracellular/intracellular bacteria. culture of BAL showed heavy growth of only Bordetella bronchiseptica. sterile saline nebulization and coupage every 12 h for 2 weeks. the left caudal lung lobe (LCd; flared arrows) is the second most severely affected lobe. the left caudal lung lobe (LCd; flared arrows) is the second most severely affected lobe after the left cranial lobe. the right lung is hyperinflated with the right cranial (RCr) and accessory (RAcc) lobes extending to the left of midline. the parenchyma is otherwise relatively normal. by 8 years of age, the entire hyperinflated right lung has developed severe patchy parenchymal lesions consisting of ground-glass opacification (black arrows) and consolidation (*) epithelial and goblet cell hyperplasia, intraluminal mucus and inflammatory cell infiltration failed to identify bacteria/microbes. culture of lung tissue showed heavy growth of Bordetella bronchiseptica. absence of histologic evidence would strongly argue against Bordetella as a pathogen at the time of biopsy. a well-organized plug of fibrous connective tissue extends into the lumen of a respiratory bronchiole. the dog was managed solely by his primary care veterinarian with courses of antimicrobials over the next 5 years. the dog was treated with sildenafil (1.3 mg/kg PO q12 h) and enrofloxacin (5.8 mg/kg PO q 12 h) five years post left cranial lobectomy, radiographic lesions were still present especially in the left caudal lung lobe of a 6-year-old miniature poodle. dog was treated with 40% inhalational oxygen, furosemide (2 mg/kg IV once), pimobendan (0.32 mg/kg PO once) and butorphanol (0.1 mg/kg IV once) the following day, the dog was breathing at 108 breaths/min in an orthopneic posture. the right lung demonstrated patchy ground-glass opacities to consolidation. the latter was mostly distributed surrounding large to medium caliber airways. the majority of which were dilated were accompanied by architectural distortion and traction bronchiectasis. each lobe was inflation-fixed with 10% formalin. post-infectious bronchiolitis obliterans is treated after resolution of infection with supportive therapies and corticosteroids to target inflammation (1\u20133) PIBO is not a recognized syndrome in dogs, this dog failed to receive corticosteroid therapy. bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) targets small airways defined as having internal diameters of 2 mm and lacking cartilage within their walls causing a spectrum of clinical signs. bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) targets small airways defined as having internal diameters of 2 mm. the dog in this case report provided support that PIBO triggered pulmonary fibrosis. injuries linked to BO in people include respiratory infections, chronic gastroesophageal reflux, allergic reactions, collagen vascular diseases, organ transplantation and chronic exposure to air pollutants. the dog in our report had severe Bordetella bronchiseptica pneumonia as a puppy, with persistent clinical signs despite appropriate antimicrobials. thoracic radiography in children with PIBO classically demonstrate hyperinflation/hyperlucency, atelectasis, patchy consolidation, airway wall thickening and bronchiectasis. fibrotic interstitial lung disease is a heterogeneous group of syndromes originating from diverse injuries culminating in scar tissue and an end-stage lung (39). fibrosis may originate secondary to fibrosis that is maladaptive and detrimental (40). the dog in this report strongly suggests PIBO can progress to widespread interstitial fibrosis. it is unknown if targeted therapy (e.g., glucocorticoids) could have prevented or slowed fibrosis by diminishing inflammation leading to aberrant repair."}
