{"summary": "one-third of the population has been infected with mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) and people infected with dormant M.tb are diagnosed as having non-clinical TB or latent TB infection. 5\u201310% of these people develop TB disease in their lives. successful vaccines against M.tb infection are needed. vaccination with a needle-free single dose should be considered as an important goal for vaccine development. rVSV has three major advantages as a potential delivery platform against TB. it is superior to elicit protective immune responses against infectious diseases at the site of infection. we developed a VSV-based vaccine VSV-846 expressing a well-defined triple-antigen fusion gene that was effective against the mycobacterium infection described in our previous report. our results indicated that vaccination with VSV-846 elicited a remarkable T cell-mediated immune response and provides effective long-term protection following BCG challenge within a single dose. six mice per group were sacrificed 6, 12, or 24 weeks after the final DNA vaccination. each group consisted of six mice. each group consisted of six mice. vaccinia virus-infected cells were co-transfected with the plasmids pVSV-XN2-846 and the other plasmids for the expression of VSV N, P, and L. supernatants were collected 48 h post transfection, filtered through a 0.2 m pore filter to remove vaccinia virus. the concentrations of IFN- in the culture supernatant were measured 2 weeks after the last immunization. splenocytes were adjusted to a concentration of 5 106 cells/ml and added to 96-well flat-bottomed plates at 5 105 cells/well with 10 g/ml of TFP846 protein. a reaction mixture (100 uL) was added to each well, which was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. high control was the maximum releasable LDH activity in the cells. Flow cytometry Twenty four weeks post final DNA immunization, the splenocytes were isolated from the immunized mice. CD4+ memory cells were stained with PerCP-anti-mouse CD4 (Biolegend), FITC-anti-mouse CD44 (Biolegend), PE-anti-mouse CD62L (Biolegend), and Pacific blue-anti-mouse CD45R (Biolegend) antibodies. single intranasal inoculations of 106 PFU were administered in a 25 l volume for VSV-846. mice were intramuscularly injected with 50 g p846 for 4 times biweekly. six mice per group were sacrificed 2 weeks after the final DNA vaccination. the fusion gene-encoding was amplified by PCR as previously described. the PCR product was cleaved with XhoI and NheI and cloned into the fifth position of the pVSV-XN2 plasmid (Cobleigh et al., 2010), generating pVSV-XN2-846. spleen cells isolated from vaccine-immunized mice were plated at 5 106 cells/well in 24-well plates. cells were stimulated with TFP846 protein (10 g/ml) as previously described. mouse myeloma cell line SP2/0 cells were pulsed with the inactivated M. tb H37Rv for 24 h as target cells. a nonradioactive cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) assay was performed with a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) cytotoxicity detection kit (Roche) spleens and lungs at indicated time points post-challenge were counted according to the colony-forming units of serial dilutions of tissue homogenates. the tissues were sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. five sections were made from each mouse in one experiment. the data were statistically analyzed by two-tailed independent Student's t-test through SPSS 12.0. the level of statistical significance was set to P 0.05. the triple-antigen fusion TFP846 was expressed in VSV-846 infected cells. the blot was probed with anti-flag antibody. g of p846 plasmid DNA administered intramuscularly or 106 CFU BCG injected subcutaneously served as control groups. immune response detection, BCG challenge, bacterial load, and evaluation of pathology were applied as indicated in the time points. mice were immunized and challenged with mycobacterium bovis BCG. the bacterial loads in mouse lungs were evaluated over time. this method resulted in 1.47 log reduction of lung CFUs. in mouse lungs were determined over a period of 24 weeks post-challenge. for one experiment, each group consisted of six mice. results are represented as the mean SD of three separate experiments. immunization was capable of providing sustained cellular immunity. memory T cells immune responses induced by VSV-846 24-weeks post final DNA immunization were isolated and the memory T cells were analyzed. the triple-antigen fusion TFP846 was amplified from p846 plasmid. the triple-antigen fusion gene was then cloned into the fifth position of the pVSV-XN2 plasmid after cleavage with XhoI and NheI. specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity was assessed by using SP2/0 cells as target cells. strongest antigen-specific cytotoxicity response was detected in p846 immunized with p846. mice subjected to various vaccinations challenged with mycobacterium bovis BCG 6 weeks post-vaccination. bacterial loads in the lungs were determined 6 weeks post-infection. sections from the normal mice were examined, revealing severe interstitial pneumonia, inflammation, and diffuse granuloma-like responses following BCG challenge. however, VSV-846-immunized mice showed much less inflammation and intact alveolar morphology as compared with mice vaccinated with p846 or BCG. e were immunized with VSV-846 24 weeks after final DNA vaccination. splenocytes were isolated and the memory T cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. the percentage of both CD4+ and CD8+ memory T cells was higher in the VSV-846 group. VSV vectors shared certain advantages for use in vaccine delivery. they can induce robust humoral and cell-mediated Th1 immunity following a single dose in the absence of an additional adjuvant. traditional vaccinations require repeated doses to induce long-lasting immunity. both Rv3615c and M.tb10.4 cover high density of T cell epitopes that promote strong T cell immune response. this includes functional T cell subsets secreting both IFN- and IL-2. a strong cellular immune response was induced with a single dose of VSV-846, as shown by increased IFN- release, lymphocyte proliferation, and T cell cytotoxicity. both the effector memory T cells and the sustainable, high proliferative capacity of central memory T cells are important for a potentially successful TB vaccine. a large population of CD44+ and CD62LLow memory T cells from isolated splenocytes 24 weeks post-vaccination. the TB vaccine VSV-846 elicited robust cellular immune responses, as well as memory T cell responses. author contributions CD and SX designed the study.
