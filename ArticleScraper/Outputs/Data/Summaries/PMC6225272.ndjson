{"summary": "aconitine species is a genus of the family Ranunculaceae. it is commonly used in treatment for various illnesses such as collapse, syncope, rheumatic fever, joints pain, gastroenteritis, diarrhea, edema, bronchial asthma, and tumors. aconitine poison is similar to the poison created by pivotal proteins such as the ryanoda. no one has reported detail of its specific binding target protein linked to toxicity. targeting of PPIs with small-molecule compounds is becoming an essential step in a mechanism study. structural modification of a familiar natural product, active compound, or clinical drug is an efficient method for designing a novel drug. the main purpose of the structural modification is to reduce the toxicity of the target compound while enhancing the utility of the drug. the identification of the structure\u2013function relationship is an essential step in the drug discovery and design. the possibility of a protein being a target of cardiotoxicity corresponds with the consistency of this experimental data. many investigations of biomacromolecules from a dynamic point of view have occurred. many important biological functions in proteins and DNA have been revealed by studying the low-frequency internal motions. the statistical parameters for database alignment\u2014q2, r2, F, and SEE\u2014were calculated by Sybyl X2.0 as shown in Table 1. the CoMFA model with the optimal number of 6 components presented a q2 of 0.624, an r2 of 0.966, an F of 124.127, and an SEE of 0.043. contributions of the steric, electrostatic, hydrophobic, hydrogen bond acceptor, and hydrogen bond donor fields were 0.120, experimental and predicted pLD50 values of both the training set and test set are shown in Figure 2. the CoMFA and CoMSIA model gave the correlation coefficient (r2) value of 0.9698 and 0.977 respectively. all values of standardized residuals fall between 3 and 3 and the values of leverage are less than h*. ryR2 Ryanodine receptor 2 19 RYR1 Ryanodine receptor 1 15 GJA1 Gap junction -1 protein (connexin43) 13 SLC8A1 Sodium/calcium exchanger 1 11 ATP2A1 Calcium transporting ATPase fast twitch 1 9 KCNH2 Potassium voltage-gated channel H2 7 SCN3A Sodium voltage-gated channel type 3, 3 SCN2A Sodium voltage-gated channel all proteins in the subnetworks will be used to predict the results of the PharmMapper server to receive the potential target of cardiotoxicity induced by aconitine alkaloids. in the meantime, 2V7O (CAMK2G) and 2VZ6 (CAMK2A) were identified as the potential targets with higher fit scores. the results of the Dock study of three proteins with an NDCG of 0.8503 and 0.9122, respectively. steric and electrostatic contour maps of the CoMFA QSTR model are shown in Figure 4A,B, respectively. steric, electrostatic, hydrophobic, and HBA contour maps of the CoMSIA QSTR model are shown in Figure 4A,B. the green regions, sterically favorable charges, were favorable for toxicity. the blue region near the R2 and R7 substitution revealed that the replacement of electropositive groups is in favor of toxicity. this can be proven by the fact that the compounds with hydroxy in these two positions had higher pLD50 values than the compound with acetoxy or no substituents. the red region surrounding molecular scaffolds was not distinct, which revealed no connection between the electronegative and the toxicity. the magenta region around R1 substitution proved that this substitution was favorable to the HBA atom. compounds with methoxymethyl substituents exhibit more potent toxicity. the red contour map where HBA atoms are unfavorable for the toxicity was positioned around R2 and R6. cluster 9 contained regulatory proteins that can activate or repress the ion channels through the protein expression level. ATP2A1, RYR2, RYR1, CACNA1C, CACNA1D, and CACNA1S mediate the release of calcium. aconitine may cause aberrant channel activation and lead to cardiac arrhythmia. Ca2+ binds to the small regulatory protein CaM, then activates the kinase. this then phosphorylates other proteins such as ryanodine receptor and sodium/calcium exchanger. the excessive activity of CaMKII has been observed in some structural heart disease and arrhythmias. the information of a binding pocket of a receptor for its ligand is very important for drug design, particularly for conducting mutagenesis studies. the information of a binding pocket of a receptor for its ligand is very important for drug design, particularly for conducting mutagenesis studies. the hydroxy in R2 formed a side chain donor interaction with Asp157. the hydroxy in R6 and R7 also formed a side chain acceptor interaction with Glu140 and Ser26 respectively. the small electropositive and hydrophilic group in R2, R6, and R7 possess a certain enhancement function to toxicity. ligand-based 3D-QSTR analysis was combined with structure-based molecular docking study to identify the necessary moiety related to the cardiotoxicity mechanism of the aconitine alkaloids. the proteins related to the aconitine alkaloids cardiotoxicity of this decade were gathered and taken as the input protein in the STRING database [51,71], used to search for related proteins or pathways. the cluster was discarded when the number of sub-graphs was smaller than 3, the density was less than 0.45, the quality was less than 0.5, and the p-value was under 0.05. the clustering results of the clusterONE are instrumental to understanding how the reliability of the PPI network relates to aconitine alkaloids\u2019 cardiotoxicity. the betweenness centrality of a node u can be calculated by [77] C C ( u) = | N U | 1 V d i s t ( u, v) is the distance of the shortest path from node u to node v. the more central a node is, the closer it is to all other nodes. the Mol2 format of three compounds was submitted to the PharmMapper server. the parameters of Generate Conformers and Maximum Generated Conformations were set as ON and 300 respectively. the results of the clusterONE and PharmMapper will be combined together to select the potential targets. tetradecahydro-2H-3,6,12-(epiethane [1,1,2] triyl)-7,9-methanonaphtho[2,3-b]azocine was selected as the common moiety. no Substituent in R1 to R13 pLD50 1 302-27-2 methoxymethyl-hydroxy-methoxy-methoxy-methoxy-methoxy-H-acetoxy-H-hydroxy-H- methoxymethyl-hydroxy-methoxy-methoxy-methoxy-methoxy-methoxy-methoxy-methoxy-methoxy-benzoxy-H-hydroxy-H-ethyl 4.33 8* 6900-87-4 methoxymethyl-H-methoxy-methoxy-methoxy-benzoxy-H-hydroxy-H-methyl 4.33 9 1356-52-1 H-H-methoxy-H-methoxy l-H-methoxy-methoxy-methoxy-methoxy-methoxy-methoxy-methoxy-methoxy-methoxy-methoxy-methoxy-methoxy-methoxy-methoxy-methoxy-methoxy-benzoxy-H-hydroxy-H-hydroxy-H-ethyl 4.4 17 71402-60-3 methoxymethyl-acetoxy-methoxy-methoxy-meth methoxymethyl-acetoxyl-methoxy-methoxy-methoxy-methoxy-methoxy-methoxy-methoxy-methoxy-methoxy-methoxy-benzoxy-H-hydroxy-H-hydroxy-H-ethyl 0.84 25 82144-74-9 methoxymethyl-acetoxyl-methoxy-methoxy-methoxy-methoxy-methoxy-methoxy-methoxy thyl 3.16 33 138729-51-8 2-acetamidobenzoate ethyl-H-methoxy-H-methoxy-methoxy-methoxy-acetoxyl-H-H-ethyl 2.84 * Test set compound. the best model has the highest q2 and r2 values, the lowest SEE, and an optimal number of components. the best model has the highest q2 and r2 values, the the leverages are calculated for a given dataset X by obtaining the leverage matrix (H) with the equation below: H = X ( X T X ) 1 X T.
