{"summary": "clinical signs include a self-limiting paroxysmal cough lasting for up to two weeks, which usually resolves without treatment. in Norway, immunisation against CIRD is performed using live attenuated viruses, annually with CPIV and every third year against canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2) twenty-two dogs competed annually in the norwich, european and world championships. the dogs were a mix of pure bred german shorthaired pointer (GSP), mixed-bred Alaskan husky/GSP or mixed-bred husky/GSP/greyhounds. the dogs were kept indoor as family pets. the owner administered 500 mg (19 mg/kg) of oxytetracycline orally. he then brought the dog to the small animal hospital 140 km away. a third dog was found anorectic and depressed (Case 3) and was brought immediately to NSVS. new tab Histological section of the lung, Case 1. There is severe congestion and presence of inflammatory cells, erythrocytes and macrophages. Gram-positive cocci are scattered within the alveolar lumina and also engulfed by alveolar macrophages. thoracic radiographs showed moderately increased attenuation of the ventral part of the right caudal lung lobe. a faint soft-tissue opacity was seen in the lung fissures. the radiograph reveals marked increased attenuation of the ventral part of the right caudal lung lobe and lobus accessorius. zooepidemicus was isolated in pure culture and showed to belong to the Lancefield Group C of streptococci. the coagulation profile was normal except for a mild leucopenia. 0.3 0.8 0.4 0 \u2013 1.8 3 0.0 n.a. 0.2 0.4 0.2 Basophils ( 109/L) 2 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0 \u2013 0.4 3 0.0 n.a. 0.1 0.0 0.0 1Reference ranges according to the Norwegian School of Veterinary Science\u2019s central laboratory. radiography of the thorax showed the same changes as for case 2. clinical progression was similar to Case 2, with normalisation of temperature (38.8\u00b0C), respiration rate (28 breaths/min), heart rate (100 beats/minute) and appetite on the second day of hospitalisation. no salivation or spontaneous coughing was observed unless whilst excited after visiting exercise pen. the dogs were kept confined for one week after they were released from the hospital. they ran free on a large (2\u20133 acres) fenced yard for two weeks. case 2 was in full training eight weeks post infection and case 3 was slightly behind. Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus was isolated in pure culture from the lung tissue with identification based on morphology, microscopy, Lancefield grouping and biochemical testing. the isolate was also tested by using API20STREP (bioM\u00e9rieux\u00ae, Lyon, France) with the same conclusion. the dog was treated with intravenous (IV) ringer acetate 100 ml/kg/hr for eight hours, thereafter 50 ml/kg/hr, enrofloxacin (Baytril, vet. Bayer; 5 mg/kg bodyweight (BW) IV once daily) the dog was hospitalised in an oxygen cage. zooepidemicus was isolated in pure culture and directly demonstrated to belong to the Lancefield Group C of streptococci. complete blood count with serum biochemistry analysis was normal except for a mild leucopenia (Table 2). The coagulation profile was normal. 0.4 3 0.0 n.a. 0.1 0.0 0.0 1Reference ranges according to the Norwegian School of Veterinary Science\u2019s central laboratory. on the second day of hospitalisation the dog showed substantial clinical improvement and was normothermic (38.1\u00b0C), less dyspneic, less tachypneic (respiration rate = 44/min), and had reduced salivation and coughing. repeated thoracic radiographs on the seventh day of hospitalisation revealed air bronchograms in the right middle lung lobe, but reduced consolidations. the dog was sent home on phenoxymethylpenicillin (Apocillin; Actavis) 660 mg PO three times daily for another 14 days. follow-up hospital care included radiographs of the thorax after one, three, five and eight weeks. the dogs competed in a sledge dog race after prolonged transportation. three days after the sled race the dogs were given a commercial polyvalent vaccine containing CDV, CAV-2, CPV, CPIV, CCoV and leptospira. clinical signs of respiratory disease were observed four days after vaccination. the use of modified live polyvalent canine vaccine combined with stress associated with training, competition and prolonged transportation may have suppressed the innate immune response to S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus. a co-infection with viral pathogens cannot be excluded and may have contributed to this outbreak. a possible source of S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus in the outbreak described in this paper was neighboring horses. however, there may have been sub-clinical carriers within the pack as Chalker and others isolated this pathogen from 9.7% of clinically healthy kennel dogs. paillot and others demonstrated that three novel genes for production of superantigens in S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus are occurring in half of the isolates from cases of disease. however, there was no indication that the carriage of these superantigen encoding genes is related to the severity of the histopathological changes. the rate of resolution of pneumonia in humans has been defined as the resolution of radiographic abnormalities associated with the disease. high performance sled dogs recovered relatively fast and returned to their previous performance level by setting time track records. caution should be taken to prevent athletes from returning to competition too fast. high-end competition, time of vaccination and too early exercise contributed to immunosuppression.
