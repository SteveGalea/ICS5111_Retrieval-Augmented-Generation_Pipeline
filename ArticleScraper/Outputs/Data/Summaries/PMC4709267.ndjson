{"summary": "EBOV and some of its relatives in the family Filoviridae cause sporadic outbreaks of a highly lethal disease. these outbreaks are thought to be initiated by viral spillover from an animal reservoir to a highly susceptible accidental host, such as a human or nonhuman primate. recent work suggests that some filoviruses infect bats in nature, and that these viruses may be distributed more widely than previously recognized. a pattern of virus and host species specificity in the filovirus susceptibility of bat cells can be explained by changes in the affinity of the essential interaction between NPC1 and the filovirus entry glycoprotein, GP. our findings support the hypothesis that bats and filoviruses have been engaged in a long-term co-evolutionary relationship, one facet of which is a molecular arms race. three african pteropodids exposed to authentic EBOV and MARV. cells from all three species were similarly susceptible to infection by MARV. cells from all three species were similarly susceptible to EBOV infection. infectivity of each virus was normalized to that obtained in vero grivet monkey cells. means for infection of the different cell lines by each virus were compared by one-way ANOVA. EBOV infection defect in the African straw-colored fruit bat cells occurs at the viral entry step. we exposed an expanded panel of kidney fibroblast cell lines from four African pteropodids to VSV pseudotypes bearing GP spikes (VSV-GP) from seven filoviruses, including two non-African viruses, Reston virus (RESTV) and Lloviu virus (LLOV) EBOV/MARV infection in permissive B\u00fcttikofer\u2019s epauletted fruit bat cells was limited by receptor availability. similar results were obtained with VSVs bearing filovirus glycoproteins. ectopic expression of human NPC1 in pteropodid kidney fibroblast cell lines. EBOV entry and infection in african straw-colored fruit bat cells was reduced to 0.1\u20131% relative to that in other pteropodids. lysosomal cholesterol could be rescued by ectopic HsNPC1 expression. incompatibility between EBOV GP and Eidolon helvum NPC1 reduces, but does not eliminate, EBOV entry into African straw-colored fruit bat cells. EBOV GP-dependent infection in EhNPC1\u2013#1 cells reconstituted with HsNPC1 was dramatically enhanced over that observed in WT cells. MARV GP-dependent infection was rescued by HsNPC1 expression to a level resembling that in WT cells. a cleaved form of EBOV GP could capture HsNPC1 domain C in an ELISA. EBOV GP bound with similar avidity to NPC1 domain Cs derived from Egyptian rousettes (RaNPC1), hammer-headed fruit bats (HmNPC1) and B\u00fcttikofer\u2019s epauletted fruit bats (EbNPC1) but poorly or not at all to that of African straw-colored fruit bat soluble pteropodid NPC1 domain C proteins derived from pteropodids measured by an ELISA. chimera between RaNPC1 and EhNPC1 domain Cs fully rescues EBOV GP-EhNPC1 binding. mean SD (n = 3) from a representative experiment are shown. restriction in EhNPC1-EBOV GP binding can be mapped to a single amino acid change in EhNPC1. a single chimera, EhNPC1 domain C containing four EhNPC1 amino acid residue changes, regained the capacity to efficiently recognize EBOV GP. residues in the NPC1-binding site are conserved among all available EBOV GP sequences. this restriction is almost certain to be encountered by all known EBOV variants and their isolates. this restriction is almost certain to be encountered by all known EBOV variants and their isolates. the alignment of bat NPC1 orthologs was analyzed with four common tests for positive selection. the alignment of bat NPC1 orthologs was analyzed with four common tests for positive selection. the alignment of bat NPC1 codons with dN/dS>1 was analyzed. dN/dS>1 reduces receptor binding to EBOV GP and viral infection. additional codons were identified in two regions of domain C that may form a part of the recognition surface for EBOV GP. mutations at these sites are thought to be driven by cycles of genetic adaptation and counter-adaptation. V141A mutation likely creates a more sterically favorable (open) NPC1-binding site. a sequence polymorphism in the NPC1-binding site of filovirus GP influences GP-EhNPC1 binding and EhNPC1-dependent filovirus entry. infection of pteropodid cells with VSV pseudotypes bearing SUDV GP (WT or A141V) means SD (n = 4) from two biological replicates are shown. no known EBOV isolate contains the V141A mutation. mutant virus also infected Egyptian rousette cells significantly less well than WT. GP residue 141 can influence cellular susceptibility to infection by modulating NPC1 recognition in a manner that depends on the sequences of both proteins. we speculate that sequence variation at residue 141 has been shaped by selective pressure to utilize restrictive NPC1 receptors. the infectivity of each virus was normalized to that obtained in vero grivet monkey cells. in panels C and D, the infectivity of each virus was normalized to that obtained in vero grivet monkey cells. asterisk indicates value below the limit of detection of the infection assay. the viral spike glycoprotein, GP1,2 (herein termed GP) mediates all steps of filovirus entry into the cytoplasm of host cells. the virus could effectively infect cells derived from other pteropodids. TAFV GP, were deficient at infecting africa straw-colored fruit bat fibroblasts. reduced infection by EBOV reflects a virus- and host species-specific restriction at the cell entry step. we engineered these cells to stably express human NPC1 (HsNPC1) and then exposed them to EBOV. Means for infection of cell lines lacking or ectopically expressing HsNPC1 were compared by unpaired two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test with Welch\u2019s correction. NPC1 in cell extracts was detected by SDS-PAGE and imunoblotting with an anti-NPC1 antibody specific to the NPC1 cytoplasmic tail. we identified a single cell clone (Eidolon helvum NPC1\u2013#1 [EhNPC1\u2013#1]) in which all NPC1 alleles bore insertions or deletions (indels) at the expected site. these indels were predicted to frameshift the NPC1 open reading frame at amino acid position 81 (Homo sapiens HsNPC1 numbering), generating truncated polypeptides arrowheads indicate lysosomes with accumulated cholesterol. infected cells were visualized by fluorescence microscopy. arrowheads indicate lysosomes with accumulated cholesterol. the low levels of EBOV infection in African straw-colored fruit bat cells likely arise from the weak, but non-zero, activity of EhNPC1 as an EBOV entry receptor. a cleaved form of EBOV GP could capture HsNPC1 domain C in an ELISA. EBOV GP poorly recognizes its ortholog of the filovirus receptor, NPC1. a single amino acid change in EhNPC1 domain C renders it fully competent to recognize EBOV GP. a chimera between RaNPC1 and EhNPC1 domain C fully rescues EBOV GP binding. podids were expressed in 293T cells, subjected to deglycosylation with protein N\u2013glycosidase F, resolved in SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and detected by immunoblotting with an anti-flag antibody. a single chimera, EhNPC1RaNPC1 amino acid residue change, regained the capacity to efficiently recognize EBOV GP. residue F or D at position 502 for all four pteropodid NPC1 proteins tested was fully concordant with EBOV GP-NPC1 binding and NPC1 receptor function. a species-specific defect in virus-receptor interaction, caused by a single amino acid residue change in EhNPC1, reduces EBOV infection in African straw-colored fruit bat cells. two non-African pteropodids, two phyllostomids, and two vespertilionids were found to have evolved under positive selection in bats. we combined the sequences obtained in this study with those of bats from six other species (two non-African pteropodids, two phyllostomids, and two vespertilionids) dN/dS>1 codons were enriched but only one codon, position 502, was identified by all four tests. a single mutation at residue 141 in EBOV GP enhances viral entry by strengthening its interaction with EhNPC1. a panel of point mutants screened for enhanced binders to EhNPC1 domain C. no single point mutant bound to EhNPC1 as well as to other pteropodids. GP(V141A) partially restored EhNPC1 binding. Means SD (n = 3\u20134) from a representative experiment are shown in each panel. Means for VSV-EBOV GP WT vs V141A infection were compared by unpaired two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test with Welch\u2019s correction. no known EBOV isolate contains the V141A mutation. LLOV and Sudan virus (SUDV) GP naturally possess A141. amino acid changes at position 141 in the GP receptor-binding site broadly influence the capacity of filovirus glycoproteins to utilize EhNPC1. a switch in receptor binding from the feline to the canine ortholog of the transferrin receptor drove the emergence of a new virus, canine parvovirus, and fueled a global disease pandemic in dogs. interactions between filoviruses and their entry receptor NPC1 can influence the cellular susceptibility of bats to infection. strong reductions in the affinity of virus-NPC1 recognition are predicted to reduce or eliminate infection in whole bat hosts. the highly virus- and host species-specific nature of the virus-receptor mismatch uncovered in this study warrants the determination of more bat sequences for inclusion in genetic analyses. there is little information currently available on the susceptibility of African straw-colored fruit bats to EBOV or their potential role as filovirus hosts. neither infectious virus nor coding-complete or full viral genomes have been successfully obtained from these bats, indicating they may only have been exposed to filoviruses, rather than being productively infected. a number of codons, including residue 502, have evolved under recurrent positive selection. this is a process in which resistant NPC1 variants are \u2018serially replaced\u2019. the filovirus GP interaction surface in the second luminal domain of NPC1, domain C, is a hotspot for such positive selection. the sequence polymorphism at NPC1 residue 502 did not impair cholesterol clearance from lysosomes. none of the residues under positive selection were found to be mutated in Niemann-Pick type C disease patients. despite being constrained by its housekeeping function, NPC1 appears to retain a sizeable sequence space accessible to adaptive mutation. we screened all available bat genomes for filovirus-related EVEs. we obtained evidence for synteny between a filovirus nucleoprotein (NP)-like EVE in the genome of the big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus) and those previously identified in three, more distantly-related, myotis bats. we can't rule out the possibility that the evolution of NPC1 in bats was driven by an entirely different infectious agent that also utilizes (or utilized) NPC1 to multiply in its hosts. filovirus LLOV, discovered in Schreibers's long-fingered bat carcasses in Spain and Portugal, may exemplify this possibility. our findings set the stage for broader explorations of species-specificity in filovirus interactions with proviral and antiviral host factors. we propose that polymorphisms in this gene nevertheless impose host barriers that impede the colonization and spread of present-day filoviruses. animals were typed morphologically and genetically as described previously. other cell lines were vero African grivet kidney cells and 293T human embryonic kidney fibroblast cells. RNA cloning vector encoding the E. helvum NPC1-specific gRNA. transfected cells were selected with 50 g/ml of blasticidin. at 24 hr post-transfection, transfected cells were selected with 50 g/ml of blasticidin. VSV pseudotypes bearing glycoproteins derived from VSV, EBOV, BDBV, TAFV, SUDV, and MARV were generated by incubating rVSV-GP-EBOV with thermolysin (200 g/mL) the protease was inactivated by addition of phosphoramidon (1 mM) (Sigma-Aldrich) cells were exposed to virus at an MOI of 1 pfu/cell (Figure 1C) or 3 pfu/cell (Figure 2A) for 1 hr. cells were fixed with formalin and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) mRNA was collected from cell lines for additional Eidolon helvum NPC1 domain C sequences. cDNA libraries were constructed, and the NPC1 transcript was sequenced. all evolutionary analyses were done using both the NPC1 gene tree and a species tree. a representative set of filovirus protein sequences was obtained from GenBank. these sequences were used as \u2018probes\u2019 in tBLASTn screens of whole genome shotgun (WGS) sequence data derived from bats of ten species. orthologous flanking sequences were identified by BLAST comparison of soluble NPC1 domain C proteins. soluble domain C was expressed in human 293-Freestyle cells (Invitrogen) and purified from supernatants by nickel affinity chromatography. cell supernatants containing soluble domain C were used directly for GP-NPC1 binding ELISAs. ELISAs were normalized as follows. GP particles were cleaved by incubation with a reduced concentration of thermolysin (12.5 g/mL, 37\u00b0C, 1 hr) due to its enhanced protease sensitivity relative to ebolavirus GPs. the viral envelope was then labeled with biotin using a function-spacer-lipid construct (Sigma-Aldrich), as described previously. cell suspensions were vortexed every 10 min, and then placed on ice for 30 min. samples were spun at 14,000 g for 10 min, and supernatants harvested for western blot. in some experiments, proteins were resolved in 8% sodium dodecyl sulfate. orescence microscope under illumination with a 63X high-numerical aperture oil objective (Figure 3B) or a 10X air objective (Figure 3C) images were cropped, inverted (Figure 3B) and subjected to linear adjustment for overall brightness and contrast using the Levels tool. cell populations stably expressing human NPC1 (HsNPC1) were generated as described previously. subconfluent monolayers of cells were transduced with a retroviral vector expressing HsNPC1 modified at the C\u2013terminus with a triple flag epitope tag. gRNA sequence to target 5\u2019-GTTGTGATGTTCAGCAGCTTCGG-3\u2019 was cloned into the gRNA cloning vector. EidNi/41.3 cells were co-transfected with plasmid encoding human codon-optimized endonuclease Cas9 (hCas9, Addgene Plasmid #41815), gRNA cloning vector encoding the E. hel amplified PCR products were tested for indels at the target site. clones were cloned into a TOPO-TA vector. multiple clones for each single cell population were sequenced. NH4Cl (20 mM) was added to infected cell cultures at 1\u20132 hr post-infection. individual eGFP-positive cells were manually counted at 12\u201314 hr post-infection. cells were exposed to virus at an MOI of 1 pfu/cell (Figure 1C) or 3 pfu/cell (Figure 2A) for 1 hr. infected cells were quantitated by fluorescence microscopy and automated image analysis. images were acquired at 20 fields/well with a 20 objective lens on an Operetta high content device. mRNA was collected from cell lines and cDNA libraries were constructed. all evolutionary analyses were done using both the NPC1 gene tree and a species tree. the species tree represents the accepted relationships amongst the bats analyzed. similar constructs bearing bat NPC1 domain Cs were generated by replacing the human domain C sequence with a sequence encoding domain C from each bat NPC1 ortholog. soluble domain C was expressed in human 293-Freestyle cells (Invitrogen) and purified from supernatants by nickel affinity chromatography. all binding steps were carried out at 37\u00b0C for 1 hr or at 4\u00b0C overnight. ELISAs with VSVs bearing LLOV and MARV GP were performed as above. biotinylated viral particles were captured onto streptavidin-coated ELISA plates. whole cell lysates were prepared as previously described. cells were washed with PBS and lysed in NTE-CHAPS buffer. samples were spun at 14,000 g for 10 min, and supernatants harvested for western blot. a rabbit polyclonal antibody was detected with an anti-flag antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma-Aldrich) bands were visualized by incubation with an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (ThermoFisher) followed by exposure to X-ray film. images were cropped, inverted and subjected to linear adjustment for overall brightness and contrast using the Levels tool. the authors declare that no competing interests exist. the authors declare that no competing interests exist. authors declare that no competing interests exist.
