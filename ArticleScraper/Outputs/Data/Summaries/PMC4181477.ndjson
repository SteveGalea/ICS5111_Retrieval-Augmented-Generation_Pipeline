{"summary": "children aged 05\u20133 years were prospectively recruited from child care centres. we classified them as fully vaccinated, partially vaccinated and unvaccinated. parents reported when their children developed an ILI. ARI is the main cause for short-term illness in children aged 0\u201314 years. the number of newly identified viruses in respiratory tract specimens, including the recently discovered polyomaviruses WUV and KIV,3,4 is increasing. children were divided into three cohorts: fully vaccinated (usually two doses in 2010), partially vaccinated (usually one dose in 2010) and unvaccinated according to their receipt of vaccines that contained influenza A (H1N1)pdm09. full definitions of enrolled children and their households are in the footnotes to Table 1. 0 0 3 (13) 021 Others 4 (44) 2 (38) 12 (50) 076 Missing 0 0 2 (08) 030 Childcare attendance, n (%) 79 (868) 46 (885) 215 (903) 064 Mean days at child care/week 272 295 284 028 Sleeping alone, n (%) 58 (637) 39 (750) 175 (735) 050 Children's households Accommodation, n (%) House 76 ( influenza-like illness * Vaccination status classified according to the group in which the subjects spent the most time during follow-up. not vaccinated against A(H1N1)pdm09 (no doses of TIV 2010 and 1 dose of TIV 2010 if the child had never received 2 doses in one previous year) southern Hemisphere TIV 2009 contained influenza A/Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1)-like virus; influenza A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2)-like virus; influenza B/Florida/4/2006-like virus. During the ILI-reporting period, each family received a weekly e-mail, text message or telephone call. /guardians given verbal and written instructions on how to collect a nose swab and a throat swab from the subject whenever an ILI occurred. parents mailed swabs to the Queensland Paediatric Infectious Diseases Laboratory. they were stored at 80\u00b0C until tested. specimens were tested for human endogenous retrovirus 3 (ERV3) using a duplex real-time PCR assay. the positive controls included in each PCR run were monitored for any shift in cycle threshold values to detect problems within individual runs. meta-Analyst 313 (Tufts Medical Centre, Boston, MA, USA) was used to calculate the probability of a virus being the sole agent identified from nose/throat swabs during an ILI episode. the study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee at The Children's Hospital at Westmead and was registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry. 127 (534) 081 Mean age

Panvax and 1 dose of trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) in 2010, or 1 dose of Panvax in 2010 and 2 doses of TIV in 2009, or 1 dose of TIV 2010 if the child had parents/guardians were given verbal and written instructions on how to collect a nose swab and a throat swab from the subject whenever an ILI occurred. parents mailed swabs to the Queensland Paediatric Infectious Diseases Laboratory, where they were stored at 80\u00b0C until tested. specimens were spiked with equine herpes virus-1 (EHV-1) and tested for EHV-1 using a duplex real-time PCR assay. the positive controls included in each PCR run were monitored for any shift in cycle threshold values to detect problems within individual runs. severe ILIs were defined as having at least one of the following features. fever 5 days, any symptom other than dry cough persisting more than 14 days, otitis media, suspected bacterial respiratory infection or admission to hospital. parents were asked to report ILIs in household members. the ILI-reporting period was 30 July to 31 October 2010. there were just four subjects who were enrolled slightly late during the first week of the ILI-reporting period. the majority (89%) of enrolled children attended CCCs. non-influenza ILIs were more common among fully vaccinated subjects (33 non-influenza ILIs, 159/person-year of observation) and partially vaccinated subjects (20 non-influenza ILIs, 154/person-year) than among unvaccinated subjects (59 non-influenza ILIs, 099/person-year, P = 0001, rate ratio 16, vaccinated versus unvaccinated, Table 1). the rates of non-influenza ILI between the two groups (vaccinated versus non-vaccinated) were 188/person-year and 109/person-year, respectively. the rates in the second half were 140/person-year and 097/person-year, respectively. at the 4-week telephone interview, symptoms other than dry cough persisted in eight ILIs at that time. forty-four ILI episodes (35%) met our definition of \u2018severe ILI\u2019. 15 had otitis media, 31 had symptoms other than post-ILI dry cough persisting >14 days, and 9 had fever persisting 5 days. a total of 175 viruses were identified from 103 ILIs. no particular virus or virus combination or multiplicity of virus infection was associated with any particular symptom or combination of symptoms or with greater frequency of antibiotic or analgesic/antipyretic use. one or more of the polyomaviruses WUV and KIV were more commonly identified in children aged 2 years (P = 005) and adenoviruses were more common in females (P = 003) \u2013 data not shown. nose swabs yielded more viruses per swab than throat swabs (161 virus identities from 117 nose swabs = 138 viruses/swab compared to 59 virus identities from 69 throat swabs = 086 viruses/swab, P 0001). 61 (88%) of 69 nose swabs yielded a virus and 45 (65%) of 69 throat swabs yielded a virus the ILI-reporting period was 30 July to 31 October 2010. there were just four subjects who were enrolled slightly late during the first week of the ILI-reporting period. their person-year contribution to the ILI follow-up period was adjusted to be from the time of joining the cohorts. enza ILIs were more common among fully or partially vaccinated subjects (33 non-influenza ILIs, 159/person-year of observation) than among unvaccinated subjects (59 non-influenza ILIs, 099/person-year, P = 0001, rate ratio 16, vaccinated versus unvaccinated) the vaccination status of subjects was not correlated with the mean number of doctor (GP, emergency department or specialist) visits made in response to non the rates of non-influenza ILI between the two groups (vaccinated versus non-vaccinated) were 188/person-year and 109/person-year, respectively. the rates in the second half were 140/person-year and 097/person-year, respectively. follow-up of ILIs Telephone follow-up 2 weeks after ILI onset was conducted for all 124 ILIs. four ILI episodes (35%) met our definition of \u2018severe ILI\u2019. 15 had otitis media, 31 had symptoms other than post-ILI dry cough persisting >14 days, and 9 had fever persisting 5 days. a total of 175 viruses were identified from 103 ILIs. no particular virus or virus combination or multiplicity of virus infection was associated with any particular symptom or combination of symptoms or with greater frequency of antibiotic or analgesic/antipyretic use. one or more of the polyomaviruses WUV and KIV were more common in children aged 2 years (P = 005) and adenoviruses were more common in females (P = 003). 61 (88%) of 69 nose swabs yielded a virus and 45 (65%) of 69 throat swabs yielded a virus. adenovirus was more commonly found in females, an association which has not been reported previously. we found only 5 ILIs caused by influenza viruses \u2013 all A(H1N1)pdm09. their illnesses were little different to the ILIs experienced by the children from whom other viruses were identified. however, the small number of influenza infections is consistent with the low degree of influenza activity during 2010,25 limiting the power of this study to detect differences in influenza infection rates. behaviours, such as hospitalisation, hearing tests and grommet insertion were significantly more common in the vaccinated groups. this suggests families that vaccinate children have a prior preference for greater healthcare service usage. a formal biological explanation is lacking. influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was the only virus constantly identified as the sole virus from ILIs. but there were too few cases (five only) to permit a firm conclusion. parents more frequently collected nose swabs than throat swabs from their children. at the start of the ILI follow-up period, we established that all parents/guardians were receiving reminder messages. during the course of the ILI follow-up period, we spoke to parents/guardians of 52% of the enrolled children. however, we did not contact all parents/guardians after the ILI follow-up period in order to determine whether they had not reported ILIs. the open-label cohort design is open to unmeasured confounding. influenza vaccines had about 16 times more ILI episodes than unvaccinated children. adeno- and rhinoviruses were most commonly detected viruses. ehui Kevin Yin analysed the data, helped with their interpretation and revised the intellectual content. ehui Kevin Yin
