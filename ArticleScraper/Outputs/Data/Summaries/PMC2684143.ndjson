{"summary": "the first derivation of genome signatures predates the invention of DNA sequencing. the frequency table at k = 1 corresponds to the raw nucleotide content on one strand. the frequency table at k = 1 corresponds to the raw nucleotide content on one strand. there are 10 values, not 8, in this vector since GC, CG, AT and TA are self-complementary. this process is called symmetrization (Karlin and Ladunga, 1994) the symmetrized values in the vector are corrected for the frequencies of their component monomers. berg et al. 2003; Campanaro et al. 2005; Dufraigne et al. 2005; Wang et al. 2005; Paz et al. 2006) length of DNA required to generate a genome signature has conventionally been taken to be around 50 kb. recent work has established that genome signatures within species may be stable over lengths as short as 10 kb (Gentles and Karlin, 2001; Abe et al. authors used genome signatures as part of a revision of the phylogeny of birds. but few have felt confident enough to draw phylogenetic trees based on genome signature comparisons. a variety of other representational schemes have been used to visualize genome signature relationships between species. the resulting \u201cflat\u201d representation may be a strong aid to intuitive understanding of the structure of complex multidimensional datasets. the SOM is not a clustering technique per se, but the surface may be divided into zones that are then treated as clusters. this absence of hierarchy means that it is particularly suited to situations where the natural hierarchy of species relationships may have been violated. a Perl script was written to divide complete genome sequences into consecutive strings of 10 or 100 kb, as required. trailing ends, and genomes shorter than the required string length, were discarded. the resulting datasets were processed to calculate their genome signatures. 2686 Alpha Varicellovirus Equid herpesvirus 1 NC_001491 Alpha Varicellovirus Equid herpesvirus 4 NC_001844 Alpha Varicellovirus Suid herpesvirus 1 NC_006151 Alpha Varicellovirus Cercopithecine herpesvirus 8 NC_006150 Beta Cytomegalovirus Chimpanzee cytomegalovirus NC_003521 Beta Cytomegalovirus Human herpesvirus 5 (AD169 virus 8 NC_003409 Gamma Rhadinovirus Murid herpesvirus 4 NC_001826 Gamma Rhadinovirus Saimiriine herpesvirus 2 NC_001350 Gamma Rhadinovirus Ictalurid herpesvirus 1 NC_001493 unassigned Ictalurid herpesvirus 1 NC_005881 unassigned unassigned Figure 3.

(1999) using a Perl script. input consisted of an array of the genome signatures generated. dimensions of the SOM and number of iterations in training were variables entered by the user. effect is calculated for each iteration m as follows: m = m / changes at each iteration of the process, and is the ratio of two other values and t the number of total iterations requested. there-fore, the number of iterations of the SOM determines the gradient at which will decrease as the iterations progress. observation of distribution of a simple data set over a SOM shows that a relatively chaotic process dominates until approximately halfway through the nominated number of iterations. the final 10% or so of iterations consist mostly of fine-tuning of the final weight vector values. the longest run presented here took in excess of 3 weeks on a single 2.8 GHz Intel processor under a Linux operating system. l scripts, for processing genomes, calculating genome signatures, and running SOMs are available on request from the author. a Perl script was written to divide complete genome sequences into consecutive strings of 10 or 100 kb, as required. trailing ends, and genomes shorter than the required string length, were discarded. simplexvirus Human herpesvirus 1 NC_001806 Alpha Simplexvirus Bovine herpesvirus 2 NC_001798 Alpha Simplexvirus Bovine herpesvirus 1 NC_001798 Alpha Simplexvirus Bovine herpesvirus 5 NC_005261 Alpha Varicellovirus Cercopithecine herpesvirus 7 NC_002686 Alpha Varicellovirus Equid herpesvirus 1 NC_001491 Alpha Varicellovirus Equid herpesvirus 4 NC_ the SOM is colored first according to genus membership and then according to family membership. the \u201cundecided\u201d column indicates the percentage of assignable sequences that were correctly assigned. the \u201ccorrect\u201d column indicates the percentage of assignable sequences that were correctly assigned. archaea SAR-1 archaea NS_000019 Ferroplasma acidarmanus Type II archaea NS_000029 Haloarcula marismortui ATCC43049 chromosome II archaea NC_006397 Halobacterium sp.

Bacteriophage X2 NC_00 the category \"Bacteriophages\" refers to unclassified phages. most phages are members of the family Caudovirales. a perl script was written to derive raw k-mer counts. the genome signature vector for length k is composed of a series of ratios of observed to expected values of its component k-mers. genome signatures are therefore not distorted by gross base compositional differences between genomes, which would otherwise be the dominant factor. wcm \u2013 vc represents the difference between the winning weight vector and the data vector for each value c along the vectors. each value of the winning weight vector is then altered to bring it closer to the data vector by a factor of, the training effect. data vectors will effectively change their winning weight vector to copies of themselves. only at the limits of the trained area R will the effect be subtler. however, as the number of iterations mounts, will decrease and each data vector will have a relatively weaker effect on its winning weight vector and even less on those weight vectors in its vicinity. 79 eukaryotic, 156 eubacterial, 30 archaeal and 122 viral genomes with more than 100 kb of sequence each. at the time of analysis there were 79 eukaryotic, 156 eubacterial, 30 archaeal and 122 viral genomes with more than 100 kb of sequence each. archaeal sequences are split into several groups along the boundary between the eubacteria and the eukaryotes. viral sequences are split into one group in the top left corner and other clusters along the eubacterial-eukaryotic border. archaea are not derivatives of either eukaryotes or eubacteria. phylum Deinococcus has two small and rather distant dominance areas. the Bacteroidetes and Spirochaetes both have small outlying fragments. the overall impression is of less clear-cut differences in GS-2 between phyla in eubacteria than in eukaryotes or archaea. phages, within the family Caudovirales, tend to be differentially located on the SOM in four major areas, one of which accounts for two of these areas. Herpesviridae, by contrast, are spread across the entire map. GS-2 distinguishes the ostreid herpesviruses and the ictaluriviruses as two fairly homogenous blocs. svirus sequences were processed into genome signature of GS-2 to GS-6. at GS-5, alpha herpes-viruses also have a coherent dominance area. at GS-5, alpha herpes-viruses also have a coherent dominance area. family level taxonomy is better determined at higher GS in all five families of herpesviruses. the ratio of high alpha-density (>95%, red) to medium alpha-density (5% to 95%, yellow) increases from 0.88 to 2.83 as the GS increases from 2 to 4. the ostreid herpesviral sequences are perfectly clustered at 100 iterations. the beta herpesviruses are also perfectly clustered at 100 iterations. the gamma and ictalurid sequences are more poorly partitioned at higher numbers of iterations. at the subfamily level, there are never more than 4.4% of sequences that cannot be assigned, and never more than 7.2% at the genus level. when 100 iterations are used and the SOM size is held at 10 10 (Fig. 7, top right table), GS-4 or GS-5 appear to be optimal. archaeal sequences are split into several groups that are situated along the boundary between the eubacteria and the eukaryotes. viral sequences are split into one group in the top left corner and other clusters along the eubacterial-eukaryotic border. it is evident that this \u201call life\u201d SOM does not contribute to the issue of the phylogeny of the three superkingdoms. the phylum Firmicutes occupies several partly adjacent areas. the phylum Deinococcus has two small and rather distant dominance areas. the Bacteroidetes and Spirochaetes both have small outlying fragments. the overall impression is of less clear-cut differences in GS-2. phages, within the family Caudovirales, tend to be differentially located on the SOM in four major areas. the Baculoviridae form a noticeably large and coherent cluster. Herpesviridae, by contrast, are spread across the entire map. GS-2 distinguishes the ostreid herpesviruses and the ictaluriviruses as two fairly homogenous blocs distinct from the alloherpesvirida longer k give better resolution than k = 2, 10 kb herpesvirus sequences were processed into genome signature of GS-2 to GS-6. at GS-5, alpha herpes-viruses also have a coherent dominance area, but this disappears again at GS-6. family level taxonomy is better determined at higher GS in all five families of herpesviruses. the ratio of high alpha-density (>95%, red) to medium alpha-density (5% to 95%, yellow) increases from 0.88 to 2.83 as the GS increases from 2 to 4. the alpha herpesviral sequences increase in density from 0.92 to 1.35. the beta herpesviruses are also perfectly clustered at 100 iterations. the gamma and ictalurid sequences are more poorly partitioned at higher numbers of iterations. there are never more than 4.4% of sequences that cannot be assigned. at the subfamily level, there are never more than 7.2% of sequences that cannot be assigned, and never more than 7.2% at the genus level. a 4% increase in accuracy of assignment is achieved at 1000 or 5000 iterations. the conservation of genome signatures within genomes would tend to suggest that signatures do not drift neutrally, at least within genomes. at the phylum level within the three superkingdoms of cellular life, satisfactory partition of GS-2 can be obtained by the SOM. however, this is less true for eubacteria than it is for archaea. the use of genome signatures in the identification of pathogenicity islands is by now well established. they indicate regions within genomes that have characteristics different to the rest of the genome. a BLAST search is more likely to generate informative hits in this context."}
