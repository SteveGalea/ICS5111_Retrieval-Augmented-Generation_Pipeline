{"summary": "cells can be inoculated with suspensions of ground tissues (e.g., lung, liver) cells are then removed from the growth vessel by scraping or with glass beads, rinsed with 0.1 mol/L phosphate buffer, centrifuged, and fixed in buffered 2.5% glutaraldehyde. coronavirus particles are mostly spherical, sometimes pleomorphic, and have an average diameter of 80 nm. virions obtain their membranes by budding into the cisternal lumen. virions are seen lining the cell membrane (arrow) ah virus nucleocapsids (arrow) aggregate in the cytoplasm and become tightly apposed to the cell membrane. the nucleocapsids can aggregate in the cytoplasm and become tightly apposed to the cell membrane as the virus begins the process of budding. family Arenaviridae Organ and tissue transplantation have become relatively common surgical procedures. on rare occasions, transplant recipients can become infected when a pathogen is transmitted from the donor. the immunocompromised status of the organ recipients enables amplification of the pathogen, which may lead to illness and death. family Flaviviridae Cell culture isolation and EM examination were instrumental in the diagnosis of an etiologic agent in a patient with an unusual clinical manifestation. a 59-year-old man in Florida, USA, had hemorrhagic symptoms, including fever, hypotension, rash, loose bloody stools, and acute renal failure. a bunyavirus was isolated from patients and identified by EM. a 28-year-old man in north Carolina, USA, had myalgias, fever, chills, and headache. a bunyavirus was originally isolated from mosquitos in 1956. a bunyavirus was identified as a new member of the genus Phlebovirus by deep sequencing. it is now known as heartland virus (29). the spherical, enveloped virions have surface projections visible on surface of some particles. cell culture and EM are an unbiased approach to identification of a previously unrecognized pathogen. unbiased thinking and collaboration among clinicians, epidemiologists and laboratorians are critical for successful investigations of diseases of unknown origin."}
