{"summary": "CF is the most common life-threatening autosomal recessive disorder in Caucasians. it is caused by defects in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and epithelial dysfunction in multiple organs. chronic bacterial infections in the airways are the most life-threatening aspects of the disease. rAAV2 is efficiently internalized from both the apical and basolateral membranes of HAE. entry through the basolateral membrane is 200-fold more effective at expressing transgenes. rAAV1 is the least sensitive, and rAAV2 and rAAV5 are the most sensitive. rAAV serotypes have demonstrated effective in vivo airway gene transfers in the mouse. this model cannot completely reproduce the in vivo extracellular environment of the airway that contains mucins and other secreted components of innate immunity. the utility of the CF mouse is limited because they failed to develop the spontaneous lung infection seen in CF patients. rAAV1 transduction seen in vitro after infection of primary FAE grown at an ALI. tracheal and whole-lung ASF contains factor that alters intracellular processing of rAAV. extracellular factor can influence intracellular processing of rAAV. rAAV1 vector rAAV2/1.RSV-AP contained an RSV-LTR-driven alkaline phosphatase expression cassette and rAAV2/1.CBA-RL contained a CMV enhancer and chicken actin promoter (CBA)-driven renilla luciferase expression cassette. rAAV1 in vivo infection of ferret lungs was performed by intratracheal instillation. et kits were anesthetized by inhalation of a mixture of isofluorane and oxygen. the installation of inoculum was performed over 10\u201320 min. animals were euthanized at desired time points postinfection with an overdose sodium pentobarbital injection. dilution of the NBT/BCIP stock solution (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) in 0.1 M Tris-HCl, 0.1 M NaCl, and pH 9.5 buffer containing 1:100 dilution of levamisole. tissues were rinsed three times with PBS over the course of 1 hr. then postfixed in 10% buffered formalin. adult tracheal washes harvested into 500 l PBS gave similar results to the whole lung lavages. all the data presented in the article used ASF harvested from lung lavages. cell culture and virus infection conditions were grown at an ALI. infections of polarized FAE ALI cultures were performed by apical application of 4109 DRP diluted in PBS or premixing with ASF in the final volume of 50 l to the upper chamber of the millicell insert. Approximately 106 cells were in each millicell insert and thus the multiplicity of infection was 4000 DRP/cell. TaqMan real-time PCR was used to quantify the physical titer of the viral stocks and copies of viral genome in cell lysates from AAV-infected cells. the PCR primers used were 5\u2032-TTTTTGAAGCGAAGGTTGTGG-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-CACACACAGTTCTCTTTG-3\u2032 (reverse) rAAV vector stocks were generated by triple-plasmid cotransfection using an adenovirus-free system and purified with an identical procedure involving iodixanol ultracentrifugation. rAAV2/2.CMVluc and rAAV2/1.CMVluc were generated by packaging the same rAAV2 proviral plasmid into AAV2 and AAV1 capsid. rAAV2/1.RSV-AP and rAAV2/1.CBA-RL were generated from rAAV2 proviral plasmids pCWRAPSP and pAV2-CBA-RL respectively. rAAV1 in vivo infection of ferret lungs was performed by intratracheal instillation of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) lacking virus. ml of passive lysis buffer was added to the pulverized tissue to extract protein. tissue extract was then centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 5 min. renilla luciferase assay kit was used for detection of alkaline phosphatase expression. anion (Poros 20 PI) and cation (Poros 20 HS) exchange resin were from Applied Biosystems. Protenase K was from Roche, and sequencing-grade endoproteinases were from Promega. adult tracheal washes harvested into 500 l PBS gave similar results to the whole lung lavages. cells were cultured as monolayers in modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin\u2013streptomycin. 106 cells were in each Millicell insert and the multiplicity of infection was 4000 DRP/cell. luciferase enzyme activity in cell lysates was determined using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega) rAAV2/5 transduces neonatal ferret airways only when proteasome function is inhibited. rAAV2/1 transduces neonatal ferret airways only when proteasome function is inhibited. rAAV1 transduction of both HAE and FAE ALI cultures was 10-fold less responsive to proteasome inhibitor induction than rAAV2/2 and rAAV2/5, suggesting that rAAV1 is less susceptible to ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent barriers after apical infection. rAAV1 transduction of both HAE and FAE ALI cultures was 10-fold less responsive to proteasome inhibitor induction than rAAV2/2 and r fourteen-day-old ferrets were infected with 51010 DRP of rAAV2/1.CBA-RL in 600 l inoculum containing the indicated concentrations of Dox. five-day-old ferrets were infected with 2.51011 DRP of rAAV2/1.RSV-AP in the presence or absence of 250 M Dox. 2/1 RSV LTR/promoter-driven alkaline phosphatase vector (rAAV2/1.RSV-AP) transduction with rAAV2/1.RSV-AP was significantly enhanced by the addition of Dox in the vector inoculum. transgene expression was observed in the tracheobronchial epithelium, bronchioles, and scatter alveolar cells. rAAV2/1 or rAAV2/2 was incubated with ferret ASF or PBS at room temperature for 1 hr. results showed that ferret ASF only inhibited rAAV2/1 transduction, but not transduction by rAAV2/2. rAAV2/1.CMVluc or rAAV2/2.CMVluc was incubated with 50 l ferret ASF (1 g/l) or PBS at room temperature for 1 hr before infection. data represent the mean (SEM) relative luciferase activity per well. the virus bound to the cell surface (4\u00b0C for 2 hr) or internalized into cells. data represent meanSEM of n=6 infections. the ability of ASF to inhibit rAAV1 transduction indeed increased with age. no differences in the specific activity of ASF was seen between 1- and 5-day-old ferrets. rAAV1 transduction from 13-day-old and adult ferrets inhibited more significantly. inhibition of the proteasome has been shown to enhance rAAV transduction through postentry virion processing and trafficking with minimal effect on viral uptake in HeLa cells. this was similar to the 5.4\u20135.9-fold reduction in vector uptake. this was similar to the 5.4\u20135.9-fold reduction in vector uptake. the inhibitory factor in ferret ASF was resistant to heat inactivation. the inhibitory factor was also resistant to digestion with N- and O-deglycosidase, heparinase, chondroitinase, and hyaluronidase. the inhibitory factor was also resistant to digestion with other endoproteinases. Ferret ASF preheated at 85\u00b0C for 45 min before infection assay retains inhibitory activity on rAAV1 transduction. data represent mean (SEM) values from n=4 independent infections. rAAV2/1.CMVluc was mixed with 3 ml PBS or ASF. after 2 hr of incubation, the virus pellets were resuspended in 100 l PBS. recovery of virus pelleted was 73% from the PBS condition and 86% from the ASF condition. proteasome inhibitor treatment rescues rAAV1 transduction in polarized FAE from inhibition by ASF. proteasome inhibitor treatment rescues rAAV1 transduction in polarized FAE from inhibition by ASF. proteasome inhibitors increased the functionality of the rAAV1 vector genome (RLU/vg) by 44-fold in the presence of ASF (i.e., 1896-fold increase in the presence of ASF vs. 43-fold increase in the absence of ASF) these findings provide insights into why the in vivo ferret airway is highly resistant to rAAV1 transduction in the absence of proteasome inhibitors. the vector efficiencies were calculated as the ratio of luciferase expression to the number of viral genome in the sample at 16 hr postinfection. rAAV1 highly transduces neonatal ferret airways only when proteasome function is inhibited. rAAV2/1.CBA-RL transduction of neonatal ferret lung after intratracheal delivery was remarkably augmented by the inclusion of Dox in the vector inoculum. fourteen-day-old ferrets were infected with 51010 DRP of rAAV2/1.CBA-RL in 600 l inoculum containing the indicated concentrations of Dox. dark purple staining demonstrates the expression of the alkaline phosphatase reporter at 8 days postinfection. images in (C\u2013F) were acquired at the 100 magnification. images in (C\u2013F) were acquired at the 100 magnification. in vivo rAAV2/1 transduction to the ferret airway required a high concentration of Dox to achieve efficient transgene expression. the adult ferret lung is refractory to rAAV2/1 transduction even in the presence of Dox. we hypothesized that a specific factor within the ASF might act as extracellular barriers to block in vivo access of rAAV2/1 to the airway epithelium. in the absence of virus, followed by viral infection in the absence of ASF, did not alter the transduction. premixing of rAAV1 with ASF before infection blocked binding of the virus to HeLa cells at 4\u00b0C and thus internalization after a shift to 37\u00b0C. rAAV2/1.CMVluc was premixed in 50 l ferret ASF (1 g/l) or PBS at room temperature for 1 hr before infection. data represent mean (SEM) relative luciferase activity per well (n=3 independent wells). rAAV1 ASF inhibitory factor increased in abundance (or became more active) as ferrets matured. no differences in the specific activity of ASF was seen between 1- and 5-day-old ferrets. cells were exposed to vector inoculum at 37\u00b0C for 4 hr in absence of 1 M Dox. at 24 hr postinfection, cells were assessed for both internalized viral genomes and luciferase reporter expression. results from these analyses showed significantly reduced internalization of ASF pre-exposed rAAV2/1. infections were performed for 4 hr in the absence or presence of 1 M Dox. the inoculums were removed and the cells were replenished with fresh medium. ferret ASF was resistant to digestion with N- and O-deglycosidase, heparinase, chondroitinase, and hyaluronidase. all infections were performed in HeLa cells cultured on a 48-well plate (105 cell/well) with 108 DRP of rAAV2/1.CMVluc. when indicated, the ASF was pretreated before incubation with virus. results indicated the mean (SEM)% inhibitory activity remaining in the ASF as compared with the untreated control ASF. rAAV2/1-RSV.AP was covalently conjugated to Dynabeads using the Dynabeads antibody coupling kit. ASF precleared with rAAV1-Dynabeads failed to block rAAV1 transduction of HeLa cells. notably, the inhibitory factor bound extremely tightly to rAAV1-conjugated Dynabeads and could not be eluted with high salt (5 M NaCl) rAAV1-bound virus retained reduced transduction activity when pelleted through a sucrose step gradient. proteasome inhibition at the time of infection significantly rescued transduction in the presence of ASF (1600-fold) proteasome inhibition increased transduction in the absence of ASF by only 46-fold. this can be appreciated by evaluating the functionality of internalized vector genomes to express their transgene. proteasome inhibitors (PI) were applied to FAE ALI cultures for 16 hr postinfection. at 16 hr postinfection, the apical inoculum was removed. the cultures were either lysed for the analyses of internalized viral genomes. study shed new insights on how inhibitory factors found in the lung can impact rAAV transduction through the altered intracellular processing of virions. the specificity of the ASF inhibitory factor toward blocking rAAV1, but not rAAV2, transduction is intriguing and suggests that interactions with the AAV1 capsid are very specific. proteasome inhibitors augmented rAAV1 transduction in HeLa cells. but the functionality of endocytosed viral genomes remained the same. the pathway of ASF inhibition appears to be primarily at the level of blocking viral binding/endocytosis. ferrets less than 2 weeks of age can be highly transduced with rAAV1. the factor blocks binding and uptake of rAAV1 in FAE. the innate immune system provides immediate protection against viral infections. the airway epithelium has multiple modalities of innate immunity, including passive (i.e., mechanical clearance), resident active biomolecules in the airway secretions (i.e., defensins and surfactant proteins), and reactive systems (i.e., pattern recognition receptors) the binding of surfactant protein A to cytomegalovirus enhances virus entry into lung cells. viruses have also adapted to counteract immune defenses by inhibiting or redirecting the proteasome inhibitors enhance rAAV transduction in vivo to ferret airways. rAAV1 reroutes internalized virions to a nonproductive pathway. a better understanding of how this inhibitory factor influences rAAV1 transduction biology. author Disclosure Statement The authors declare no conflict of interest."}
