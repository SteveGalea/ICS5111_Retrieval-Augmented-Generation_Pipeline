{"summary": "influenza A virus has been circulating in the human population for 95 years. initial mortality was extremely high, but dropped exponentially over time. the exact nature of H1N1 mutation accumulation over time has not been fully explored. the H1N1 influenza A virus swept the world during the 1917\u20131918 pandemic. approximately 40% of the human population was infected, with a death rate above 2%. it is estimated that this virus killed more people than died in the world war. this applies also to the 2009 outbreak, which caused relatively few deaths in those areas with good reporting systems in place [8]. improved medical treatments, such as antibiotic treatment for flu-related pneumonia, were certainly a significant factor reducing H1N1 mortality. there are thousands of fully-sequenced influenza genomes available in public databases, including a reconstructed version of a 1918 H1N1 genome. most of these have collection dates and lineage information associated with them. flu strain has recombined with another strain and obtained a segment of RNA from the second strain. there are several factors that influence strain diversity, including mutation rate, selection, drift, and cross-immunity-mediated competition. phylogenetic studies can build robust family trees, but do so by focusing only on a limited number of \u201cinformative\u201d genomic locations. influenza viruses continued to circulate in mammalian species by maintaining a high mutation rate. they wondered if the only reason such a virus continued to circulate was because of a sort of \u201cgene therapy\u201d through reassortment with stronger, less mutated avian viruses. alignment for each of the eight sections of the flu genome was completed. points mutations were counted individually while indels, irrespective of size, were counted as a single change. we used another Perl program to scan through the alignment and compare each sequence to a reference strain. we calculated the normalized codon scores (NCS) and relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) [51] score for each predicted protein of each genome. we downloaded the frequency of each of the 64 codons in the human, duck and domestic pig genomes from the Codon Usage Database [52] the earliest sequenced genotype (California/04/2009) was used as the baseline for comparison with all subsequent genotypes. the vertical red line indicates the date the reference sequence was collected. this sequence is not included because it, by definition, has a mutation count of zero and ignores contemporaneous sequence variation. nine strains that do not belong to the \u201cfrozen\u201d lineage arose in the human population between 1976 and the 2009 H1N1 outbreak. these strains fall on the same mutation-count trajectory as the H1N1 circulating before the 1957 extinction. however, these nine strains appear to represent repeated transmission events from pigs to humans that failed to cause any pandemic. the earliest 2009 outbreak strain had already accumulated 1,889 mutations compared to the 1918 strain. reassortment can produce novel antigenic variants, but it does not reverse the majority of mutations, for they have accumulated in the non-reassorted areas of the genome. the lineage re-introduced in 1976 was the only significant human H1N1 strain from 1976 until 2009. the mutation count trajectory of the H1N1 lineage from the 1976 re-introduction stops abruptly in 2009 and does not reappear in any of the 353 H1N1 genomes published from mid-2009 through mid-2012. the human H1N1 lineage had accumulated approximately 1400 mutations. only 41.8% of all nucleotide sites were invariant. re-introduced H1N1 lineage had accumulated fewer mutations than porcine. the majority (98.2%) of genomes in this study are predicted to fail to produce a full-length version of the protein. only 10 of the 11 influenza proteins were included in RSCU and NCS calculations. all genomes were predicted to produce fully-formed PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, NA, M1, M2, and NS1 proteins. over the 2009\u20132010 H1N1 outbreak, Kedwaii, et al. [8] demonstrated near-complete lineage loss during a single season. the phylogeny appears as a main trunk with many short-lived side branches. variations that appear several times over the course of H1N1 are most likely due to mutations occurring multiple times in the same place. the accumulation of non-synonymous mutations was highly linear. over the history of the human H1N1 lineage, the accumulation of non-synonymous mutations was highly linear after correcting the \u201cfrozen\u201d portion of the lineage (1976\u20132009) for 21 years of dormancy. the red line at 1.812 indicates the score that would be obtained from a series of proteins with the same amino acid content as those produced by H1N1 but with randomized codons. most codons changed in frequency in a highly consistent manner over the life of the 1918 human H1N1 strain. selection is evident in H1N1 and other influenza genomes. despite this common perception, a more lethal version of H1N1 has not arisen via mutation within the human population during the last 90+ years. in this paper, we examine an alternative point of view regarding mutation accumulation within the H1N1 virus. we suggest that specific adaptive mutations commonly occur within the H1N1 virus, but many more deleterious mutations are accumulating than beneficial mutations. however, H1N1 appears to have been in very gradual error catastrophe throughout its history. we show compelling new evidence supporting the extinction of human H1N1 in the 1950s, its subsequent re-introduction in 1976, and an apparent second extinction event of the human H1N1 lineage in 2009. we are the first to document the replacement of the re-introduced human H1N1 with reassorted swine H1N1 in 2009. there have been major medical advances since 1918, and these have clearly been a factor in reducing H1N1-related mortalities. the correlation between mutation count and reduced H1N1 mortality might be considered spurious by some. the correlation between mutation count and reduced mortality is only one of our evidences for the genetic attenuation of H1N1. the frequency of codon usage is positively correlated with tRNA availability in the cell [64] the increased use of rare codons is expected to negatively affect protein translation rates. anhlan, et al. [51] entertained several hypotheses, including that the virus was avian in origin but transferred to pigs before it jumped to humans. a viral genome of approximately 13,000 nucleotides does not have room for very much neutral RNA. david frum: if some significant portions of the viral genome are neutral, deletions should be regularly seen. he says if some significant portions of the viral genome are neutral, deletions should be regularly seen, and selection should favor such deletions. frum: if some significant portions of the viral genome are neutral, deletions should be regularly seen. a viral genome in the absence of reassortment is essentially a single linkage block, it is expected that many more than just adaptive mutations occur. many factors can cause a breakdown in the selective removal of deleterious mutations. the genetic changes in H1N1 appear non-directional and are distributed quite uniformly across the genome. reassortment may bring in new material, but so far this has only applied to a limited section of the genome. the origin of human H1N1 influenza is unknown, but is generally reasoned that it invaded the human population from a natural reservoir [5,51], most likely an aquatic waterfowl. reassortment between a \u201cfresh\u201d virus and a high-mutation-count virus will inevitably lead to, at best, an averaging of the mutational load of the two. the 2009\u20132010 \u201cswine flu\u201d virus shows evidence of multiple reassortment events in a limited portion of its genome, and it was more robust than the lingering human strain that it replaced. there is a constant exponential decline in influenza-related mortality over time. the correlation between mutation count and reduced H1N1 mortality might be considered spurious by some. the correlation between mutation count and reduced H1N1 mortality might be considered spurious by some. the decline in mortality is a remarkably smooth curve, while medical advances have occurred in bursts. the correlation between the exponential decline of H1N1-related mortalities and the linear increase in H1N1 mutations is only one of our evidences for the genetic attenuation of H1N1. a disruption of codon bias might negatively impact the functionality of a particular stretch of any nucleic acid. a viral genome of approximately 13,000 nucleotides does not have room for very much neutral RNA. a viral genome of approximately 13,000 nucleotides does not have room for very much neutral RNA. there is no significant deletion in any of the 2009\u20132010 genomes compared to the 1918 version. the only major indels occurred among the oldest samples (prior to 1948) in the sixth genomic segment (neuraminidase, or NA), but all of these represented deletions compared to the 1918 version. selective adaptation is limited to those amino acids that produce significant phenotypic effects. a viral genome in the absence of reassortment is essentially a single linkage block. some of the changes might be due to selection, but the majority certainly are not. the origin of human H1N1 influenza is unknown, but it is generally reasoned that it invaded the human population from a natural reservoir [5,51], most likely an aquatic waterfowl. there is no evidence for reasortment in the human H1N1 lineage, and it has gone extinct, apparently twice. natural selection is strongly at work in the influenza genome. this can be seen by preservation of all the basic proteins and functions of the virus. emergence of major antigenic variants shows that positive selection is operational. the most recent common ancestor existed only about 120 years ago. the rate of mutational divergence from that original genotype has been very constant. modern H1N1 strains have diverged from the original genotype by roughly 1,900 fixations. authors declare that they have no competing interests. RC wrote the computer programs and performed most of the analyses. both authors contributed equally to the preparation of the manuscript."}
