Fungal components and products relevant for indoor air sciences Fungal agent Short description Applications in indoor air sciences Fungal agent Short description Applications in indoor air research Fragments Particles of fungal origin that are smaller than whole spores (typically 1 m) nucleic acids Contains the genetic material of a fungal cell (DNA) or acts in converting the genetic information (RNA) Located in the different cellular organelles and the mycoplasm No relevance as a potential causative agent of health outcomes Widely used as a target in DNA-based methods that are increasingly applied in indoor air research. fewer emergency department visits and/or hospitalizations among children in the remediation group compared to those in the control group. asthma symptoms and asthma medication use declined in the intervention group. 50% of families in developed countries have a pet. cockroach allergens are found in dog hair, shed skin cells, saliva, and urine. the combination of cockroach allergen exposure and allergic sensitization contribute to asthma morbidity. allergy to pollen induces rhinoconjunctivitis. a quarter of the subjects who were allergic to pollen also exhibited allergic asthma from pollen. one-half of subjects with allergic rhinitis to animals or HDMs also exhibited asthma from pollen. asthmatics who smoke are likely to experience a higher rate of hospitalization than asthmatics who do not smoke. inhaled corticosteroids, which represent the most effective currently available treatment for chronic asthma, have a reduced efficacy in smokers. a public smoking ban in Scotland has reduced the rate of asthma exacerbations. a similar effect was observed in Minnesota as well as at the national level. a similar effect was observed in the u.s. indoor chemical air pollution can be lowered by avoiding cooking-related pollutants, avoiding the use of sprays and other cleaning materials that generate volatile organic compounds (VOCs), choosing furniture and building material with low VOC emissions, and regular air exchange by natural or mechanical ventilation. bronchospasm was reported in 2% of adverse drug reactions. analgesics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were involved in 24% of these cases. bronchospastic reactions should not be equated with asthmatic bronchospastic reactions. indoor allergens House dust mite (HDM) allergens are ubiquitous pyroglyphidae that live in human dwellings. their proliferation is favored by high indoor humidity and elevated temperatures. arguments in support of their involvement as triggers of asthma attacks include an association between HDM allergen exposure and asthma outcomes. dust collected from the homes of patients includes many other air contaminants besides HDMs and HDM allergens, such as bacteria and endotoxins, molds, glucans originating from mold membranes, mycotoxins, and microbial volatile organic compounds. being sensitized to HDMs does not mean that HDM allergens play a role in the clinical expression of the disease. Ia, evidence obtained from meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials, IIb, evidence obtained from at least one other type of well-designed quasiexperimental study. IV, evidence obtained from well-designed nonexperimental descriptive studies, such as comparative studies, correlation studies, and case studies. MVOCs are not a good indicator of fungal growth as there are very few VOCs specific to microbial sources only Mycotoxins Nonvolatile fungal secondary metabolites with a variety of chemical structures Chemically stable and some are thermally stable. there are thousands of mold species, but only 80 indoor molds are thought to be responsible for adverse health effects in humans. the association between dampness or mold and the impact on health is presented in Table 4. 50% of families in developed countries have a pet.22\u201324 This figure is the same for families with allergies. there are as many dogs as cats, although cats are more allergenic than dogs. cockroach allergens originate from mouse urine, shed skin cells, hair follicles, and are mostly found in inner-city dwellings. high levels of allergens may be found in schools and homes, but their relationship with asthma morbidity is still controversial. four meta-analyses on HDM avoidance for asthma by Gotzsche and Johansen concluded that avoidance was of no benefit to asthmatic patients. Platts-Mills has criticized these meta-analyses on the basis that this approach is inadequate because allergen avoidance protocols are multifaceted and personalized. levels Clinical effectiveness House dust mite allergen avoidance Encasing mattresses, pillows, and quilts in impermeable covers Ib Ia \u2013 no effect in adults Ib \u2013 some effect in children Washing bedding in the hot cycle (55\u00b0C\u201360\u00b0C) IIb IV Replacing carpets with hard flooring Ib IV Acaricides and/or tannic acid III IV Minimizing dust accumulating objects in closed cupboards IV IV Vacuum cleaners with integral HEPA filter fungal agents may have relevance as exposure agents related to health effects Ergosterol Sterol specific to fungal cells Present in most fungal cells, underrepresented in yeasts No specific role as health-relevant agent Ergosterol content used as a proxy for fungal biomass Glucans Major structural component of fungal cells (1\u20133)- and (1\u20136)-linked polymers of d-glucose Nonallergenic but possess proinflammatory properties Glucans\u2019 content is used as a proxy of bioactive portion cleotides Contains the genetic material of a fungal cell (DNA) or acts in converting the genetic information (RNA) located in the different cellular organelles and the mycoplasm No relevance as a potential causative agent of health outcomes Widely used as a target in DNA-based methods that are increasingly applied in indoor air research. there are few published interventional studies regarding dampness and mold in homes. in one study, there were significantly fewer emergency department visits and/or hospitalizations among children in the remediation group compared to those in the control group. measures since even low levels of cat allergens will still cause sensitized patients to react. cockroach allergens are found in dog hair, shed skin cells, saliva, and urine. there is no difference between breeds in terms of allergy induction. a quarter of the subjects who were allergic to pollen also exhibited allergic asthma from pollen. approximately one-half of the subjects with allergic rhinitis to animals or HDMs also exhibited asthma from pollen. a quarter of the subjects who were allergic to pollen also exhibited allergic asthma from pollen. one-half of the subjects with allergic rhinitis to animals or HDMs also exhibited asthma from pollen. pollen avoidance is only relevant during the time that pollen is airborne. 21% of americans with asthma are active smokers. inhaled corticosteroids are the most effective currently available treatment for chronic asthma. smoking cessation in smokers with and without asthma is an underutilized opportunity. a public smoking ban in Scotland has reduced the rate of asthma exacerbations. a similar effect was observed in Minnesota as well as at the national level. hospital attendance for asthma patients decreased by 10%. air pollution can be lowered by avoiding cooking-related pollutants. avoid the use of sprays and other cleaning materials that generate volatile organic compounds (VOCs), choosing furniture and building material with low VOC emissions, and regular air exchange by natural or mechanical ventilation. analgesics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were involved in 24% of these cases. anti-infectious in 18%, cardiovascular drugs in 11%, drug formulation agents in 9%, vaccines and immunoglobulins in 5.5%, plasma volume expanders in 5.5% and other drugs in 27%. there are large discrepancies in the recommendations from national societies. the American Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology recommends to avoid any trigger but does not mention how to do that. there are no validated methods for identifying those who are likely to benefit. no scientific society recommends basic HDM avoidance procedures."}
