{"summary": "a 27-month-old girl was born by normal vaginal delivery after 40 weeks of gestation. her medical history included leukocytosis at 3 months and splenomegaly at 6 months of age. she had multiple infections before 2 years of age, including otitis media and a central vein catheter infection. despite aggressive therapy, the patient\u2019s condition continued to deteriorate. the patient died later that day; the probable cause of death was viral pneumonitis. a mouse monoclonal antibody against viral protein (VP) 1 from WUPyV (NN-Ab06) or an isotype-matched control antibody was incubated overnight. slides were incubated with NN-Ab06 and then the secondary antibody. staining protocol was similar to regular IHC protocol with several steps. UC5AC (Thermo Fischer, Rockford, IL, USA; no. MA1\u201338223) was developed with 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine. staining with NN-Ab06 followed blocking steps. Tissues stained by using the dIHC protocol were not counterstained. extracts were also tested for human bocavirus (HBoV) by using a previously described qPCR assay (12). overlapping primer sets were designed from reference strain WU/Wuerzburg/02/07.

SK-4100 qPCRs were performed using iQ Supermix reagents. each 25-L reaction mixture contained 0.6 mol/L forward primer, 0.3 mol/L probe, and 5 L nucleic acid extract. conventional PCR and sequencing was performed by using primers forward 5\u2032-GGAGCTGTAYAGAATGGAAAC-3\u2032 and reverse 5\u2032-TTCATCCAAYAGTGGAATTG-3\u2032. complete genome sequence for isolate Rochester-7029 is available through GenBank under accession no.

FJ794068) was sequenced from lung tissue to 4 coverage (each base sequenced independently 4 times) nucleotide identity scores for Rochester-7029 ranged from 0.970 to 0.985. the genome contained a 77-bp terminal duplication in the large T-antigen. oV qPCR Negative Negative Negative *Numbers indicate cycle thresholds from qPCR. HBoV, human bocavirus; IHC, immunohistochemistry; KIPyV, KI polyomavirus; qPCR, real-time quantitative PCR; WUPyV, WU polyomavirus. after detection of WUPyV in the patient\u2019s tissues by real-time qPCR, WUPyV-specific IHC with human tracheal tissue at original magnification of 200, stained with NN-Ab06 (E) or an isotype control antibody (F) the middle panels show insets from panels A, C, and E (dotted boxes) at higher original magnifications (600). the middle panels show insets from panels A, C, and E (dotted boxes) at higher original magnifications (600). mavirus viral protein 1 in CD68-positive cells from a child with fatal acute respiratory illness was stained with NN-Ab06 (blue) and a monoclonal antibody against CD68 (brown). the initial IHC staining of tracheal tissue revealed positive cells within a submucosal gland. HBoV, another small, circular DNA virus, in 2005 and 2 new polyomaviruses, WU and KI (KIPyV) in 2007 in the respiratory tracts of children with acute respiratory illness prompted us to investigate the involvement of these viruses in this case. the entire WUPyV genome was sequenced from lung tissue to 4 coverage. amic acid to glutamine at positions 250 and 107, respectively. we also predicted amino acid changes in large T-antigen. the Rochester-7029 genome contained a 77-bp terminal duplication in the large T-antigen. serial sections stained with no primary or secondary antibodies were also negative. overall, we saw 3 patterns of staining in the lung. in some cells, WU-VP1 staining was primarily in the nucleus. in others, the perimeter of the nucleus was strongly positive. in others, the staining was diffuse, making it difficult to discern its position within cells. CD68 is a glycoprotein present on monocytes and macrophages. we performed dIHC testing by using the monoclonal antibody against WU-VP1 (NN-Ab06) and a monoclonal antibody against CD68. cells positive for both WU-VP1 and CD68 were detected within the patient\u2019s lung tissue. each assay was performed on control cell pellets. the MUC5AC dIHC assay yielded clearer staining. it is unclear whether the 2 antigens colocalize to the same cell. it is unclear whether the 2 antigens colocalize to the same cell. adenovirus has grown in primary cultured peribronchial submucosal gland cells. rhinovirus has grown in human respiratory submucosal gland cells. adenovirus has grown in peribronchial submucosal gland cells. syndrome coronavirus antigen and RNA have been detected in tracheal/bronchial serous gland epithelium (21), and BKPyV has been shown to replicate in salivary gland cells (22,23). the role of WUPyV as a human pathogen remains unclear."}
