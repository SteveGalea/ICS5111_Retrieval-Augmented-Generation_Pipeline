{"summary": "results Synthesis and detection of N6-methyladenosine (m6A)25. the modification found internally in the mRNA of many eukaryotes26,27,28,29. this method was modified to label and detect only the first nucleotide after the cap. all oligoribonucleotides were synthesized using the standard protocol for solid-phase RNA synthesis with a 15 min coupling time per nucleotide. the last coupling step was followed by a standard DMTr-off procedure, the oligonucleotides were removed from the solid support, deprotected, precipitated and desalted. oligonucleotides SK-526 (m6Am) and SK-524 (Am) were mixed in ratios of 5:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2 and 1:5, end labelled using T4 polynucleotide kinase. the calculated percentage of m6Am closely matched the actual m6Am percentage. m6Am:pAm ratios are between 15:1 (brain) and 2:1 (liver) m6Am is more prevalent at the cap1 than Am. mRNA from liver and testis was assayed on the first transcribed nucleotide. de-capped and end-labelled DNA targets were first cross-linked to 2 mm 2 mm teeth cut from a Hybond N+ membrane. the individual teeth containing the labelled mRNA gene-specific fragments were then removed and digested to nucleotide 5' monophosphates using P1 nuclease. testis tissues almost exclusively had m6Am at the cap adjacent position. this was four times larger than the m6Am:Am ratio for the testis mRNA population as a whole. the cap adjacent nucleotides of pabpc1 transcripts were predominantly unmodified. the oligoribonucleotides were synthesized using the standard protocol for solid-phase RNA synthesis with a 15 min coupling time per nucleotide. the last coupling step was followed by a standard DMTr-off procedure, the oligoribonucleotides were removed from the solid support, deprotected and precipitated. the oligonucleotides SK-524 and SK-526 were mixed in ratios of 5:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2 and 1:5, end labelled using T4 polynucleotide kinase, digested to 5' mononucleotides and separated by TLC. the resulting spots were quantified using phosphorimaging. mRNA transcripts were radiolabelled at their 5' end using T4 polynucleotide kinase. the labelled RNA was digested to monophospho-nucleotides by P1 nuclease. new spots corresponding to the 2'-O methylated nucleotides are apparent in the labelled samples after cap removal. single stranded DNA from yeast gene IME2 was used as a negative control DNA in the hybridisations. mRNA from liver and testis was de-capped and end-labelled as described above then fragmented to 120 nt. this was then hybridised to single stranded DNA targets corresponding to the 5' region of selected messages. mRNA targets were cross-linked to 2 mm 2 mm teeth cut from a Hybond N+ membrane. the labelled nucleotide in the cap adjacent position included A, G, U and C, as well as m6Am and Am. this is consistent with multiple alternative transcription start sites at and around the Inr32. in both cases, Am and m6Am appeared as the major nucleotide modifications. most genes will give rise to a population of mRNAs that differ in their starting nucleotides. for example the Prm2 message initiates predominantly at the central A of the Inr as well as a second A 3 nucleotides upstream. Apoa1 strongly initiates at the A of the Inr but also uses surrounding U, G, C and sites at a significant level. the amino group is targeted for methylation by the m6Am methylase. a direct synthetic method for the preparation of the desired m6Am phosphoramidite reagent dramatically improves access to these materials for biological evaluation. the aqueous layer was extracted with ether, the combined organic extracts were dried over Na2SO4 and the volatiles were removed in vacuo. 2'-OMe-Bz-m6A-CE phosphoramidite was readily purified by column chromatography (1:1 petrol/ether9:1 ether/methanol) oligoribonucleotides SK-524 and SK-526 Oligoribonucleotides SK-524 and SK-5 RNA oligonucleotides were synthesized using a standard 0.2 M scale protocol. the polymer-bound oligoribonucleotide was transferred from the synthesis column to a 1.5 ml microfuge tube. the mixture was heated to 65 \u00b0C for 10 min, cooled to room temperature and centrifuged for 1 min (10,000 g) oligo(A) RNA was purified twice using oligo(dT) cellulose (Fluka) followed by oligo(dT) magnetic beads (Invitrogen) all samples were quantified and assayed for poly(A) purity using an Agilent Bioanalyser. the forward oligonucleotides were 5' phosphorylated. the amplification products were subsequently digested with lambda nuclease. 100 ng of this ssDNA (2 l) was spotted onto 2 mm 2 mm teeth cut from a Hybond N+ membrane. RNA samples were resuspended in 20 l of sterile distilled water. 5' ends were labelled using 30 units T4 polynucleotide kinase (PNK, Fermentas) and 7.4 MBq [-32P] ATP at 37 \u00b0C for 30 minutes. reaction made up to 60 l with sterile distilled water then passed through a spin column (Bio-Rad) to remove unincorporated isotop Hybridised membranes exposed to storage phosphor screens (K-screen; KODAK) imaged using bio-Rad Molecular Imager FX. individual teeth containing target mRNAs end labelled at the cap adjacent position were cut off and digested with P1 nuclease (Sigma) 2'-OMe-Bz-m6A-CE phosphoramidite and 2'-OMe-Bz-m1A-CE phosphoramidite were synthesized on an ABI 394 DNA/RNA synthesizer. mass spectra were recorded using a Bruker Ultraflex III mass spectrometer via MALDI-TOF. the polymer-bound oligoribonucleotide was transferred from the synthesis column to a 1.5 ml microfuge tube. the mixture was heated to 65 \u00b0C for 10 min, cooled to room temperature (water/icebath) and centrifuged for 1 min (10,000 g) all supernatants were combined and dried (2 h under nitrogen stream, then freeze dried) ion-exchange beads were rigorously cleaned with dilute HCl, washed with water, then treated with dilute NH3 and finally washed with water again to generate Dowex-NH4+. matrix stock (20 l) was mixed with Dowex-NH4+ (5 l) and each oligoribonucleotide sample (1 l) was mixed with Dowex-NH4+ (19 l) after 30 min the sample solution was spotted onto the sample well and allowed the forward oligonucleotides were 5' phosphorylated, the amplification products were subsequently digested with lambda nuclease. 100 ng of this ssDNA (2 l) was spotted onto 2 mm 2 mm teeth cut from a Hybond N+ membrane. l of sterile distilled water and 5' ends were labelled using 30 units T4 polynucleotide kinase (PNK, Fermentas) and 7.4 MBq [-32P] ATP at 37 \u00b0C for 30 minutes. reaction made up to 60 l with sterile distilled water then passed through a P-30 spin column (Bio-Rad) to remove unincorporated isotope. 1.5 l of the released 5' individual teeth containing target mRNAs end labelled at the cap adjacent position were cut off and digested with P1 nuclease (Sigma) in a final volume of 3 l. all of this digestion mix was applied to a cellulose coated TLC plate."}
