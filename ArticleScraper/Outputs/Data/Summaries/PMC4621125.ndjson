{"summary": "simultaneous coinfections occur when pathogens share the same route of transmission, such as insect vectors or contaminated blood products. multiple insect bites from virally infected insect vectors (e.g., mosquitoes) can cause coinfection. mosquitoes can be coinfected and transmit multiple viruses (1, 2). multiple vaccines given simultaneously or as combination formulations are similar to a coinfection due to exposure to antigens from a number of different pathogens at the same time. CDC protocols allow for children to receive up to nine vaccine injections containing 13 different vaccines at their 12- to 15-month doctor's visit if the child is behind in the vaccination schedule (11). Vaccine interference, where one vaccine dampens the antibody response to another during administration of multiple vaccines, has been reported. LCMV/Pichinde viruses (PICV) or LCMV/vaccinia virus (VACV) have previously extensively studied these viruses in both single-virus infection of naive hosts and sequential infections. LCMV-immune mice infected with PICV generate a low frequency of memory CD8 T cells specific to the subdominant epitope NP205. LCMV-immune mice challenged with VACV have several well-defined cross-reactive memory responses, including LCMV-NP205, LCMV glycoprotein (GP) residues 34 to 41 (LCMV-GP34), and LCMV GP residues 118 to 125 (LCMV-GP118), that can expand and mediate faster viral clearance (18, 22) the disease outcome, protective immunity and/or panniculitis, is dependent on which cross-reactive epitope-specific in this study, we determined whether the competition during infection with two viruses at the same time would alter the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of CD8 T cell memory formation. we would predict that the increased competition for resources within the coinfection environment would further enhance stochasticity of the TCR repertoire selection. supernatant was harvested at 48 h postinfection. the rL212A variant harbors a leucine-to-alanine mutation at position 8 of the NP205 epitope. this point mutation abrogates the CD8 T cell response to NP205. alanine transferase (ALT) assay was purchased from 21st Century Biochemicals (Marlboro, MA) kit directions were followed in this assay except that only 15 l of serum was mixed with 150 l of substrate. the following peptides were purchased from 21st Century Biochemicals (Marlboro, MA) the total number of LCMV-, PICV-, or VACV-specific CD8 T cells was calculated by summing the total number of cells producing IFN- to multiple epitopes specific to each virus. for each virus, the response to immunodominant epitope(s) was included along with at least one subdominant epitope, depending on the virus. for LCMV the total response was the sum of the responses to all of the known CD8 T cell epitope abdominal fat pads were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formaldehyde and paraffin embedded. pathology was blindly graded by pathologist based on distribution and severity of disease from 0 to 6. sequence similarity between measles and mumps viruses and LCMV and PICV was determined using William Pearson's Lalign program. descriptive statistics are expressed as means standard errors of the means. Statistical analysis was done using a two-tailed Student's t test. a Bonferroni posttest was used to measure differences between categorical data sets. Vaccinia virus (WR strain) was propagated on NCTC-L929 cells (27) mice were challenged with either 2 106 PFU of LCMV CL-13 intravenously (i.v.) or 2 107 PFU of PICV i.p. to control for cell culture contaminants, a plaque assay was stained with iodonitrotetrazolium chloride (INT) synthetic LCMV peptides NP396\u2013404 (FQPQNGQFI; NP396), GP33\u201341 (KAVYNFATC; GP276), NP205\u2013212 (YTVKYPNL); and VACV peptides B8R20\u201327 (TSYKFESV; B8R); A47L138\u2013146 (AAFEFINSL; A47L); E7R130\u2013137 (STLNFNNL; E PICV-, or VACV-specific CD8 T cells was calculated by summing the total number of cells producing IFN- to multiple epitopes specific to each virus. for each virus, the response was included along with at least one subdominant epitope, depending on the virus. for LCMV the total response was the sum of the responses to NP396, GP33, GP276, and NP205. pathology was blindly graded by a pathologist based on the distribution and severity of disease from 0 to 6. the sequence similarity between measles and mumps viruses and LCMV and PICV was determined using William Pearson's Lalign program. linear regression was used to measure differences between categorical data sets. RESULTS LCMV/PICV-coinfected mice showed reduced protective immunity and increased immunopathology compared to single-virus-immune mice after challenge. LCMV/PICV-coinfected mice had significantly increased viral loads and immunopathology after challenge. after at least 6 weeks mice were considered immune and challenged with either CL-13 or PICV. data were pooled from three similar experiments. data were pooled from two similar experiments. naive mice showed normal fat pad structure, naive+PICV mice showed focal patches of mononuclear infiltrates. LCMV/PICV+PICV mice showed severe necrosis of up to 50% of the fat pad. after PICV challenge 92% of PICV-immune mice cleared PICV by day 3 postchallenge. by day 5 postchallenge virus could not be detected in either PICV-infected or coinfected mice. weight loss was used as a surrogate to assess the degree of immunopathology in LCMV/PICV- or LCMV-immune mice following homologous challenge with CL-13. naive mice infected with PICV had a substantial drop in relative weight by day 2 postchallenge but by day 7 their weights were similar to those of PICV-immune mice. naive mice did not develop AFN, and only 1 out of 9 PICV-immune mice had very mild AFN (AFN score) LCMV/PICV-coinfected mice had significantly enhanced immunopathology and slower viral clearance than single-virus-immune mice during either LCMV or PICV homologous challenges. these data are consistent with the coinfected mice having a less efficient memory T cell response that allows for prolonged viral replication in peripheral organs. these changes will have significant clinical impact when an individual is reexposed to that virus. coinfected mice had more PICV-specific cells than coinfected mice. on day 8 (A) and 8 weeks postinfection (B) total numbers of virus-specific CD8 T cells were determined based on IFN- production in an ICS assay to multiple virus-specific epitopes in LCMV-, PICV-, and LCMV/PICV-infected mice. INT-stained plaque assay was performed in LCMV-infected and LCMV/PICV-coinfected mice after primary infection. data show that during coinfections with different combinations of viruses, there can be a dramatic reduction in the total number of cells specific to one of the viruses. there was a significant reduction in the number of effector memory-like cells (CD62Llo KLRG1+ IL7R), suggesting that this population may play an important role in protection when there are an equal number of central memory cells. however, there was no difference in LCMV viral load in the spleen between LCMV-infected and coinfected mice. CV-specific response was dominant (Fig. 3B, mouse 2,D, mouse 4, and G) cross-reactive, subdominant NP205-specific response was dominant (Fig. 3D, mouse 2, dotted box, and G) these virus-specific response-dominant groups were also observed at memory time points (Fig. 3D), and if the viruses were combined within same needle prior to injection (Fig. 3G). four individual LCMV/PICV-coinfected mice representative of immunodominance patterns observed 8 weeks postinfection in 15 similar experiments. wild-type (WT)-coinfected mice, n = 164 from 15 similar experiments; wild-type combined infection (wild-type viruses were combined in the same injection) LCMV-specific CD8 T cells in LCMV response-dominant LCMV/VACV-coinfected mice and a higher number of PICV-specific cells in PICV response-dominant LCMV/PICV-coinfected mice. in coinfected mice the dominating virus-specific response correlates with the decreased virus-specific CD8 T cell response. challenge and weight loss on day 3 postchallenge (E) of LCMV/PICV-coinfected mice that were LCMV-, PICV-, or codominant compared with responses of PICV-infected mice during PICV challenge. the coinfected mice with the lowest number of LCMV-specific memory cells had significantly higher viral load and greater weight loss than LCMV-immune mice. no association between relative weight loss during PICV challenge and interviral response dominance in coinfected mice. a greater number of PICV-specific CD8 T cells was contributing to enhanced fat pad immunopathology in some coinfected mice after PICV challenge. coinfection may cause some other qualitative changes in the immune response to PICV that leads to increased immunopathology upon PICV challenge. the frequency and proportional NP205-specific response in coinfected mice had a greater mean (7.44%) and range (4.42 to 17.68%) than the NP205-specific response in PICV-infected mice (mean, 0.76%; range, 0.37 to 2.68%). LCMV/PICV-coinfected mice increased private specificity with new predictable intravirus-specific immunodominance hierarchies. LCMV/VACV-coinfected mice have altered immunodominance hierarchies. LCMV-infected, VACV-infected, and LCMV/VACV-coinfected mice have increased frequency of cross-reactive CD8 T cells. NP396- and GP33/34-specific responses are codominant in LCMV-immune mice. proportion of NP396-specific cells is significantly greater than proportion of GP33/34-specific cells among coinfected mice. LCMV-specific immunodominance hierarchies of individual LCMV/PICV-coinfected mice are highly variable. cross-reactive NP205-specific memory T cells mediated enhanced immunopathology in LCMV/PICV-coinfected mice during PICV challenge. increased NP205-specific memory T cells mediated enhanced immunopathology in LCMV/PICV-coinfected mice during PICV challenge. cross-reactive NP205-specific memory proportions prior to PICV challenge directly correlated with severity of immunopathology in LCMV/PICV-coinfected mice after CL-13 challenge. NP205-specific memory proportions prior to PICV challenge directly correlated with severity of disease as indicated by percentage of weight loss (A and B), AFN score (C and D), or fat pad histopathology score (E and F) rL212A/PICV coinfection prevented panniculitis and necrosis of fat pads associated with PICV challenge of LCMV/PICV-coinfected mice. these results indicate that the enhanced responses to the cross-reactive NP205-specific response mediated the increased immunopathology in LCMV/PICV-coinfected mice during PICV challenge. LCMV/PICV-coinfected mice showed reduced protective immunity and increased immunopathology compared to single-virus-immune mice. naive mice were infected with the Armstrong strain of LCMV, with PICV, or with both simultaneously. LCMV and PICV both induce strong CD8 T cell responses. LCMV/PICV-coinfected mice had significantly increased viral loads and immunopathology after challenge. after at least 6 weeks mice were considered immune and challenged with either CL-13 or PICV. data were pooled from three similar experiments. fat pad sections from naive, naive PICV-challenged (naive+PICV) mice and coinfected PICV-challenged mice were stained with H&E at day 7 of PICV-challenge. naive+PICV mice showed normal fat pad structure, naive+PICV mice showed focal patches of mononuclear infiltrates, and LCMV/PICV+PICV mice showed severe fected mice cleared PICV by day 3 postchallenge (P 0.0004, by Fischer's exact test) by day 5 postchallenge virus could not be detected in either PICV-infected or coinfected mice. weight loss was used as a surrogate to assess the degree of immunopathology in LCMV/PICV- or LCMV-immune mice following homologous challenge with CL-13. naive mice infected with a naive mice infected with PICV had a substantial drop in relative weight by day 2 postchallenge. by day 7 their weights were similar to those of PICV-immune mice. coinfected mice had protracted weight loss, losing weight gradually until day 4. LCMV/PICV-coinfected mice had significantly enhanced immunopathology and slower viral clearance than single-virus-immune mice during either LCMV or PICV homologous challenges. these data are consistent with the coinfected mice having a less efficient memory T cell response that allows for prolonged viral replication in peripheral organs. this leads to the recruitment of a greater number of effector cells and enhanced T cell-mediated immunopathology. coinfected mice had more PICV-specific cells than coinfected mice. on day 8 (A) and 8 weeks postinfection (B) total numbers of virus-specific CD8 T cells were determined based on IFN- production in an ICS assay to multiple virus-specific epitopes in LCMV-, PICV-, and LCMV/PICV-infected mice. LCMV-specific CD62Lhi CD8 T cells, which are associated with central memory, have previously been shown to mediate protection in LCMV-immune mice during high-dose CL-13 challenge (42). LCMV-specific CD62Lhi CD8 T cells, which are associated with central memory, have previously been shown to mediate protection in LCMV-immune mice. RG1+ IL7R suggests that this population may play an important role in protection when there are an equal number of central memory cells. antigen load can alter the differentiation and proliferation of T cells. there was no difference in LCMV viral load in the spleen between LCMV-infected and coinfected mice on day 3, 5, or 7 after primary infection. in mice infected with a single virus, either LCMV or PICV, the normally subdominant, cross-reactive NP205-specific response was absolutely never dominant in thousands of mice infected over the last 20 years. the variability in which virus-specific response dominates was also reproducible in a second coinfection model using LCMV/VACV. LCMV- or VACV-infected mice (n = 5 mice/group from two similar experiments) three individual LCMV/VACV-coinfected mice representative of immunodominance patterns observed in two similar experiments. wild-type (WT)-coinfected mice, n = 164 from 15 similar experiments; wild-type combined infection (wild-type viruses were combined in the same injection) in coinfected mice the dominating virus-specific response correlates with the decreased virus-specific CD8 T cell response. the total number of LCMV-specific CD8 T cells for LCMV/PICV-coinfected mice was compared with responses of LCMV-infected mice. LCMV/PICV-coinfected mice were LCMV-, PICV-, or codominant compared with responses of PICV-infected mice during PICV challenge. weight loss. (G) AFN score. (H) Fat pad (FP) histology score. a greater number of PICV-specific CD8 T cells was contributing to enhanced fat pad immunopathology in some coinfected mice after PICV challenge. coinfection may cause other qualitative changes in the immune response to PICV that leads to increased immunopathology upon PICV challenge. LCMV/PICV-coinfected mice had increased private specificity with new predictable intravirus-specific immunodominance hierarchies. peripheral blood lymphocytes were isolated from LCMV-infected, PICV-infected, and LCMV-coinfected mice at least 6 weeks post-primary infection. LCMV/PICV-coinfected mice presented with a new LCMV-specific immunodominance hierarchy. the addition of the larger LCMV-NP205 response could be responsible for the significant increase in the NP205 response in coinfected mice. GP33/34-specific responses are codominant in LCMV-immune mice. the proportion of NP396-specific cells is significantly greater than the proportion of GP33/34-specific cells among coinfected mice. LCMV-specific immunodominance hierarchies of individual LCMV/PICV-coinfected mice are highly variable. increased NP205-specific memory T cells mediated enhanced immunopathology in LCMV/PICV-coinfected mice during PICV challenge. in previous studies using sequential infection with LCMV and PICV, enhanced fat pad pathology was mediated by the reactivation of the cross-reactive NP205-specific memory cells (16). NP205 was the dominant response in some LCMV/PICV-coinfected mice (Fig. 3D, dotted box, and G and to PICV challenge, mice coinfected with rL212A/PICV experienced significantly less weight loss than the mice coinfected with LCMV/PICV. rL212A/PICV coinfection resulted in a variation in the interviral immunodominance hierarchy similar to that observed with LCMV/PICV. NP205 memory response mediates immunopathology in LCMV/PICV-coinfected mice during PICV challenge. naive mice (naive+PICV) showed focal patches of mononuclear infiltrate. wild-type LCMV/PICV-immune mice challenged with PICV showed severe necrosis. increased competition present during a simultaneous coinfection with two viruses led to altered immune responses to the two individual viruses. changes resulted in reduced immunity and enhanced immunopathology upon homologous challenge with either of the immunizing viruses. LCMV/PICV-coinfected mice with a dominant PICV-specific response had fewer numbers of LCMV-specific cells. a reduced number of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) presenting antigens from each virus would drive increased competition between T cells specific to different antigens for access to APC binding sites. higher-affinity clones out-competing lower affinity clones (51) this high level of competition may further impact the inherent stochasticity of T cell activation. LCMV CL-13 is a fast-replicating virus. the number of LCMV-specific CD8 T cells has a large impact in the disease outcome of individual LCMV/PICV-coinfected mice. this may be because the slower replication rate of PICV does not put as much pressure on the memory cells to clear the infection quickly. NP205 cross-reactivity was found to be beneficial in LCMV-immune mice challenged with PICV and in PICV-immune mice challenged with LCMV (14, 15, 17) however, this cross-reactive response can also lead to detrimental effects. some mice that are infected sequentially, first with PICV and then 6 weeks later with LCMV. NP205-specific memory response may have resulted from enhanced exposure to a similar antigen present in both viruses. the addition of the PICV-NP205-specific cells is trivial and does not alter the proportion of NP205-specific cells in coinfected mice. studies have already shown that disease can be associated with cross-reactive responses (14\u201319, 21\u201323, 27, 49, 52\u201368) in mice and in some human infections, where CD8 T cell epitopes are well defined for several viruses, clear networks of cross-reactivity have been determined (14\u201319, 21\u201323, 27, 49, 52\u201368) this type of networks are the basis for understanding the implications of cross-reactivity in human disease and vaccines. cell responses that are not identified in single-virus studies can result in loss of immune protection and enhanced disease upon reexposition to that pathogen."}
