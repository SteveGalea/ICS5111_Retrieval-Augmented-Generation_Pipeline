{"summary": "avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a gamma coronavirus that causes a highly contagious upper-respiratory tract disease in chickens. some live vaccines can cause a clinical reaction, which often leads producers to give less than a full dose of vaccine. improper vaccine application or vaccines that do not provide adequate protection due to serotype differences can lead to persistence of viruses in the field. the emergence of new strains and the reemergence of one or more previously circulating IBV types is unpredictable, which confounds decisions on which combination of vaccines should be used. if the vaccines selected are not effective, outbreaks can occur. if the vaccines selected are not effective, outbreaks can occur. clinical cases were obtained from 3 different diagnostic laboratories. we could compare virus types circulating in the two-major broiler chicken producing areas on the east coast. the DELMARVA peninsula was also selected because there was no vaccine available at the time of sample collection. s from embryonated chicken eggs containing field isolates of IBV from three different diagnostic laboratories. s from embryonated eggs containing field isolates of IBV from three different diagnostic laboratories. s were previously identified by the diagnostic laboratories using specific real-time RT-PCR or by partial S1 gene sequencing. 51 Vaccine isolated from vaccinated chickens Ark C-6 EU283056 Vaccine isolated from contact exposed chickens Ark B-13 EU283053 Vaccine isolated from contact exposed chickens Mass A-1 EU283073 Vaccine Mass A-2 EU283074 Vaccine Mass A-2 EU283074 Vaccine Mass B-3 EU283078 Vaccine isolated from vaccinated chickens Mass D-3 EU283087 Vaccine isolated from vaccinated chickens Mass D-6 analysis of recombination Putative recombinant sequences were identified with the software package of SimPlot. the nucleotide identity was calculated using the Kimura 2-parameter method with a transition\u2013transversion ratio of 2 in each window of 200 bp with a step size of 20 bp. the best-fit nucleotide substitution model was determined. using the single-likelihood ancestor counting (SLAC), fixed-effects likelihood (FEL), internal fixed-effects Likelihood (IFEL), random effects likelihood (REL), fast unconstrained Bayesian approximation for inferring selection (MEME) all analyses utilized the best-fit model of nucleotide substitution and employed input NJ phylogenetic trees.

DMV/1639 type viruses had 19 potential glycosylation sites. none were found to contain positively selected residues. DMV/1639 and Mass type isolates were not found to have recombination with other IBV types. red box = recombination of MDL-Ark-DPI-15-5519 with DMV/1639. blue boxes = recombination of 6 Ark strains with mass vaccine type virus. the median-joining network was constructed from the S1-encoding gene. the network included the most parsimonious trees linking the sequences. each unique sequence is represented by a circle whose size reflect the frequency of the sequence in the data set. median-joining network was constructed from the S1-encoding gene. each unique sequence is represented by a circle whose size reflects the frequency of the sequence in the data set. branch length is proportional to the number of mutations. the median-joining network was constructed from the S1-encoding gene. each unique sequence is represented by a circle whose size reflects the frequency of the sequence in the data set. dN/dS Positively selected sitesa N Amino acid position b Mass 27 0.681 3 129 (N/H), 179(E/A), 273(T/S) DMV 35 0.503 1 90 (G/D/N/S), 94 (A/T/V), 119 (S/P), 171 (H/Y), 223 (H/Q/Y), 323c (R/T/M), 326 (N/Y), 3 this is unique to the ArkDPI vaccine and is due to a minor subpopulation in the vaccine, exhibiting polymorphisms in the S1 spike. the major subpopulation in the vaccine, which is well suited for vaccine propagation in embryonating eggs, is not very well suited for infection in chicks. the number of individual viruses or small groups of virus types around each of the two predominant clusters suggests that these satellite groups are the result of mutations occurring in Ark-DPI vaccine viruses persisting in the flocks. ML phylogenetic and network analysis of the Mass-type viruses showed two vaccine related groups and outgroup containing pathogenic Mass/Mass41/41 and the laboratory strain Beaudette. adapted from a highly virulent virus causing lesions in the kidney can result in significant mortality to a virus causing only mild respiratory signs. the virus type isolated, even from diseased birds, is often the same type as the vaccine. the question then remains if the isolated virus is attenuated vaccine masking the real problem virus, or a truly pathogenic field virus that has broken through the immune response. this data supports the hypothesis that the predominant groups of the Ark-DPI vaccine like viruses originated from vaccine viruses. so, it appears that live attenuated vaccine usage does play a role in the genetic profile of similar viruses in the field."}
