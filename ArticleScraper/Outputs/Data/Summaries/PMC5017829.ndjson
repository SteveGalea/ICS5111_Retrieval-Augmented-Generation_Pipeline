{"summary": "in recent years, the number of mumps cases in the united states has fluctuated from hundreds to thousands of cases per year. in 2006, a multi-state mumps outbreak in the Midwest consisted of over 6,500 cases. in 2009\u20132010, two large outbreaks occurred in New York City and Guam, affecting about 3,000 and 500 persons respectively. the mumps virus is typically mild and self-limited, but is highly contagious for susceptible patients when proper isolation and containment measures are not rapidly initiated. a single case can result in up to 12 secondary cases in a susceptible population. mumps can sometimes have serious long-term sequelae including infertility/subfertility, central nervous system infection, deafness, and severe pancreatitis. patients often have trismus and have difficulty chewing and speaking. in about 10% of cases, other salivary glands, especially the submandibular gland, can become involved and can mimic anterior cervical lymphadenopathy. the most common complication of mumps infection is orchitis. in post-vaccination era, orchitis has been reported in 15% to 40% of post-pubertal males with mumps. mumps orchitis and subsequent testicular atrophy have been weakly associated with the development of testicular tumors, including cancer. meningitis is typically seen 3\u20134 days after the onset of parotitis. as of early 2016, there is no association between perinatal mumps infection and significant congenital malformations. other rare complications associated with mumps infection include pancreatitis (with rare reported cases of severe hemorrhagic pancreatitis), ECG abnormalities (depressed ST segments, prolonged PR intervals and inverted T waves), myocarditis, polyarthritis, abnormal renal function (with rare reports of severe or fatal nephritis), hepati the incubation period of mumps virus averages 16\u201318 days. infected patients are most contagious at 1 to 2 days prior to symptom onset. the differential diagnosis includes other causes of parotitis. mumps virus is typically self-limiting with treatment primarily directed towards supportive care including antipyretics and analgesics. antibiotics are also commonly prescribed both because it can be difficult to distinguish mumps orchitis from bacterial infection and to prevent superimposed bacterial infection. the Identify-Isolate-Inform tool was conceived during the 2014 outbreak. it was a concise method to identify and manage patients presenting to the ED who might have Ebola. the tool was adopted and distributed to EDs nationwide by the CDC. prior to touching a patient to measure the traditional vital signs, triage nurses must consider whether the patient may be contagious (or contaminated with a risk of contaminating others) and initiate appropriate isolation measures to protect healthcare providers and other patients/visitors from contagion/contaminant. some epidemiologic risk factors (e.g., recent travel to west africa for Ebola virus disease) or other risk factors (e.g., close contact with a known asymptomatic infected patient in healthcare providers should elicit exposure history, vaccination status and medical history to determine whether the affected patient is immunocompromised. all healthcare providers, regardless of vaccination status, should wear a gown, gloves and a mask. CONCLUSION Mumps has been reemerging in the last decade with multiple outbreaks of hundreds to thousands of cases per year. mumps is a viral illness that is contagious from person to person prior to symptom onset."}
