LSQ superposition of unbound PEDV-3CLpro and (R)-16 bound SARS-3CLpro. subgroup 2b resulted in an all-atom RMSD value of 5.18 and a C-alpha RMSD value of 4.98. the overall active site architectures of both SARS-3CLpro and PEDV-3CLpro are largely similar despite their lower sequence identity. the residues directly involved in binding to (R)-16 via hydrogen-bonding interactions are all conserved. the bifurcated interaction between the furan ring oxygen and the amide carbonyl oxygen of (R)-16 and the backbone amide NH of SARS-3CLpro Gly143 is mimicked by PEDV-3CLpro Gly142. however, the IC50 of (R)-16 against PEDV-3CLpro is 17-fold higher than against SARS-3CLpro. the regions of the S2 loop comprised of residues 47 and 48 in each FIPV- and SARS-3CLpro are indicated by a cyan dashed line. we then analyzed the reported X-ray structures and sequences for other alpha-coronavirus 3CLpro\u2019s in the PDB databank. a larger size of the S2 pocket in SARS-3CLpro is consistent with the SARS polyprotein 1ab having a phenylalanine residue at the P2 position of the nsp5/6 cleavage site. this larger S2-pocket in SARS-3CLpro is consistent with the SARS polyprotein 1ab having a phenylalanine residue at the P2 position. the structure of PEDV-3CLpro is similar to the X-ray structure of the unbound human coronavirus 229E 3CLpro. it belongs to the same coronaviral phylogenetic subgroup as the human coronavirus 229E 3CLpro. a superimposition of PEDV-3CLpro with FIPV-3CLpro shares 61.9% sequence identity. this work advances our understanding of the subtle, but important, structural differences between 3C-like proteases from different coronaviral phylogenetic groups. small structural changes have been shown to be essential in enzymatic catalysis and an understanding of these differences is also very pertinent for the design of both broad-spectrum and selective coronaviral 3CLpro\u2019s. the cells were harvested by centrifugation (8,400 g for 20 min) to yield 14.5 g L1 of cells. the cell pellet was then re-suspended in Buffer A (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 0.2 M ammonium sulfate, 0.05 mM EDTA, 5 mM BME) the cell lysate was clarified by pelleting the cell debris via centrifugation. fractions containing pure PEDV-3CLpro were pooled, dialyzed into storage buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 2.5 mM DTT, 10% glycerol) the protein was flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 \u00b0C in a freezer until further use. diffraction quality crystals grew at 20 \u00b0C in 25% isopropanol and 22% PEG-4000 at a protein concentration of 1.5 mg mL1. the best crystals grew at 20 \u00b0C in 25% isopropanol and 22% PEG-4000 at a protein concentration of 1.5 mg mL1. iterative rounds of manual building and structural refinement were completed using PHENIX. manual inspection, rebuilding and the addition of water molecules were accomplished using the programs Coot27 and PHENIX. the IC50 value of (R)-16 against PEDV-3CLpro was determined using 100 L assays conducted in the following buffer: 50 mM HEPES, 0.1 mg/mL BSA, 0.1% TritonX-100, 1 mM DTT. the IC50 and %Imax values are the errors in the fitted parameters resulting from fitting of the equations to the data. pET-11a PEDV-3CLpro cells were grown at 25 \u00b0C for 24 hours. cells were harvested by centrifugation (8,400 g for 20 min) to yield 14.5 g L1 of cells. cell pellet was then re-suspended in Buffer A containing 1 mg mL1 lysozyme. protein was eluted with a linear gradient to 100% Buffer B (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 1 M sodium chloride, 0.05 mM EDTA, 5 mM BME, 10% glycerol) over five column volumes (300 mL) collecting 5 mL fractions. containing PEDV-3CLpro were pooled and concentrated to protein concentrations of 1.5, 2.8, and 4.0 mg mL1. the best crystals grew at 20 \u00b0C in 25% isopropanol and 22% PEG-4000 at a protein concentration of 1.5 mg mL1 and appeared after 24\u201372 hours. data collected on LS-CAT beamline 21-ID-F at Argonne National Laboratory. data were indexed, integrated and scaled using HKL-200025. resulting structure factor amplitudes were used for molecular replacement. the reaction was initiated by the addition of 20 L of 10 M UIVT3 substrate. the reaction was initiated by the addition of 20 L of 10 M UIVT3 substrate. the reaction was then measured over a period of 10 minutes as relative fluorescence units. the data were fit to the following equation (2) to determine the IC50: where %Imax is the percent maximum inhibition of 3CLpro. the errors in the IC50 and %Imax values are the errors in the fitted parameters resulting from fitting of the equations."}
