{"summary": "IBD is an immunosuppressive disease caused by infectious bursal disease virus. it can infect immature B-lymphocytes in the bursa of Fabricius. maternal immunity and active immunity can protect chicks against IBDV infection. chicken has different repertoire of immunity genes, molecules, cells, and tissues. chicken lacks lymph nodes, but has bursa of fabricius and cecum tonsil. avian immunity is relatively lagging compared with the mouse, human, and swine. bacillus saerimneri (L. sae) has the ability to colonize the chicken intestine. VP2 was constitutively expressed on the surface of L. sae. cell suspensions centrifuged at 600 g for 8 min were resuspended in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin. phages were amplified in Escherichia coli ER 2,738 for. phages were incubated with marrow cells and unbound phages were added into chBM-DCs for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. the nucleotide sequence of each phage was determined with 96 g III primer. the sequence was translated into a peptide sequence. FITC-labeled peptide (25 g) was incubated with 106 chBM-DCs at 4\u00b0C for 10 min. cells were incubated with 25 g FITC-conjugated peptides overnight. recombinant VP2 fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) after 24 h of induction using 1 mM isopropyl-D- thiogalactopyranoside at 15\u00b0C. recombinant fusion proteins were purified using an Ni-NTA Superflow Column (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China) fluorescence of eGFP expressed by Lactobacillus was evaluated by flow cytometry. peptides with better binding ability to chBM-DCs are labeled with a solid line (A) chBM-DCs were incubated with 2 g/mL purified protein. total RNA from non-stimulated chBM-DCs and chBM-DCs incubated with purified protein was isolated using a commercial kit. qRT-PCR was performed using a 7,500 Real-Time PCR system. recombinant Lactobacillus strains were cultured overnight in MRS medium, washed with sterile PBS, and resuspended at 5 109 CFU in 200 mL in PBS. chicks randomly divided into four groups (30 chicks per group) polystyrene microtiter plates were coated overnight at 4\u00b0C with IBDV propagated on DF-1 cells. goat anti-chicken IgY (KPL, MD, USA) or mouse anti-chicken IgA (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL), both diluted 1:3,000, were then added as secondary antibodies and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. color was then developed using 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-Tetramethylbenzidine chicken health was monitored daily for a 14-days observation period. chickens that developed severe clinical symptoms were euthanized. at 14 days post-challenge, surviving animals were sacrificed and necropsy was performed. adapted IBDV strain and DF-1 cells (chicken embryo fibroblasts) were kept in our laboratory. pPG-T7g10-PPT contained the HCE strong constitutive promoter. pgsA anchor from Bacillus subtilis washed twice with sterile phosphate buffer saline. three-quarters of the medium were replaced with complete medium every 2 days. CD11c and MHCII expressed on the surface of DCs on the 6th day and CD40 and CD86 expressed on the surface of LPS-stimulated DCs on the 7th day were analyzed using flow cytometry. ELISA, Flow Cytometry, Fluorescence Microscope, and Laser Confocal Microscopy were fixed on 0.03 mg/ml polylysine-coated 96-well plates for 30 min at 25\u00b0C. cells were blocked with the PBS (2% w/v BSA) for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. cells were fixed with polylysine on coverslips, washed, and incubated with 25 g FITC-conjugated peptides for 20 min at 37\u00b0C. slides were stained with 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3\u2032,3\u2032-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DIL) membrane probe (Beyotime, Haimen, China) for 10 min at 37\u00b0C recombinant fusion proteins were purified using an Ni-NTA Superflow Column. targeting peptide was fused to the C terminus of vp2 to generate pPG-eGFP-vp2-SP. recombinant plasmids were electrotransferred into the expression plasmid pPG-T7g10-PPT-eGFP. phage ELISA: peptides with better binding ability to chBM-DCs are labeled with a solid line (A) flow cytometry analysis: counts and gate of FITC-labeled peptides binding to DCs. total RNA from non-stimulated chBM-DCs and chBM-DCs incubated with purified protein was isolated. qRT-PCR was performed using a 7,500 Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) the primers used for qRT-PCR were designed based on target sequences reported previously. -actin was amplified as an internal control. the immunization dosage was 5 109 CFU and it was administered on two consecutive days (days 1, 2). Booster immunizations were administered on days 11, 12, 22, and 23. chickens (3 chickens in each group) were sacrificed to collect intestinal fluid and tracheal fluid. sera from chickens on day 26 post-immunization were filtered and inactivated at 65\u00b0C for 30 min. the sera were serially diluted 2-fold (1:2, 1:4, 1:8, 1:16, 1:32, 1:64......) the intermixture was inoculated onto a DF-1 cell monolayer at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 incubator. four groups of broiler chickens (24 per group) were orally challenged with very virulent IBDV at 22 days post-immunization. the dose was 350 LD100 of chicken embryo. chicken health was monitored daily for a 14-days observation period. round Input phages (PFU) Marrow cells-binding phages (PFU) Output phages (PFU) Recovery rate (output/input) 1 2 1011 1.31 106 6.55 106 2 1.86 1011 2.3 109 1.7 106 9.14 106 3 2.1 1011 3.4 109 4.83 105 2.3 106 4 1.45 1011 3.8 109 2.15 105 1.48 106 For further confirmation, we chose FITC-labeled peptides hardly bound to the monocytes, as expected. SP, AP, and AH showed better binding ability among the six candidates. mulated chBM-DCs at the same point were used as calibrator. -actin was chosen as the reference gene. the up-regulation of chBM-DCs marker genes such as costimulatory molecules indicates the maturation of DCs. IL-12 plays an important role in the activities of natural killer cells and T lymphocytes. pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-, IL-1, and IL-6) and chemokines (CXCLi1) mRNA levels were also higher in the VP2-SP groups at 8 h and at 6 h for IL-1. anti-IBDV VP2 monoclonal antibody were used as primary antibodies. calculated molecular weight of the fused protein was about 132kD. eGFP and VP2 were about 63, 27, and 42 kD, respectively. results showed significantly higher levels of IBDV-specific systemic IgY antibodies on day 26 (p 0.05) and those of IBDV-specific mucosal sIgA antibodies in the intestinal mucus. the same comparative results were observed using sIgA antibodies in the trachea, day 15 (p 0.01) and day 26 (p 0.05) post-immunization in chicken orally administered with pPG-vp2-SP. the TCID50 of the IBDV cell-adapted strain in the DF-1 cells was measured and calculated by the Reed-Muench method (about 106.1/ml) the serum-neutralizing antibody titers of the pPG-vp2 group were calculated to be 1:4, 1:6, and 1:4, and titers in the pPG-vp2-SP group were 1:2, indicating no neutralizing activity was observed in the sera. pPG-eGFP-vp2-SP/M-11 and pPG-eGFP-vp2/M-11 had good protective effects. chickens in the pPG/M-11 group developed severe clinical signs of infection and died by 1 week post-challenge. chickens survived acute phase of the disease recovered from clinical disease. the shrinking in the pPG-eGFP-vp2-SP/M-11 group was less than that in the pPG-eGFP-vp2/M-11 group (p 0.05). the shrinkage in the pPG-eGFP-vp2-SP/M-11 group was less than that in the pPG-eGFP-vp2/M-11 group. four rounds of phage display biopanning were performed. 168 phages were randomly selected for sequencing. of these, 54 phages displayed no peptides. FITC-labeled peptides hardly bound to the monocytes, as expected. SP, AP, and AH showed better binding potentiality. peptides that occurred once may have binding ability. confocal microscopy (C) shows the cell membrane dyed by DIL in red. changes to the brightness, contrast or color balance were applied to every pixel in the image by microscopy. recombinant protein (about 90 kD) can be detected by western blotting. some chBM-DCs markers expression by chBM-DCs stimulated by VP2-ctrl and VP2-SP was assessed by relative qRT-PCR (D) the cytokines released by DCs are involved in immune responses and have a critical effect on differentiation of nave T cells into Th1 and Th2. IL-12 plays an important role in the activities of natural killer cells and T lymphocytes. recombinant plasmids were transformed into Lactobacillus. expression of the recombinant protein was determined by western blotting. negative control, pPG612, did not express a corresponding immunoreactive band. eGFP expressed in L. saerimneri had bioactivity. the protein of interest has been expressed in Lactobacillus. primary immunizations were carried out on two consecutive days. groups (n = 4) of SPF chickens were orally immunized with recombinant strains and PBS. anti-IBDV-specific sIgA levels in the intestinal mucus (C) and trachea fluid (D) post-immunization with recombinant strains. after challenge, IFN- was up-regulated significantly compared with that before challenge. the same comparative results were observed for IL-4 which is a key regulator in humoral and adaptive immunity. IL-2 plays crucial roles in regulating both immune activation and homeostasis. both pPG-eGFP-vp2-SP/M-11 and pPG-eGFP-vp2/M-11 had good protective effects with a rate of 80% (12 chickens) and 60% (9 chickens), respectively. 20 percent of the chickens in the pPG/M-11 group survived with mental depression and reduction in food consumption. both pPG-eGFP-vp2-SP/M-11 and pPG-eGFP-vp2/M-11 had a good protective effect with rates of 62.5% (15 chickens) and 37.5% (9 chickens), respectively. the shrinkage in the pPG-eGFP-vp2/M-11 group was less than that in the pPG-eGFP-vp2/M-11 group (p 0.05). recombinant L. sae M-11 can adhere to the intestinal epithelium to compete with pathogenic bacteria for binding epitopes. only a small quantity of immunogen of interest can penetrate the gut wall to be taken up by APCs (35). recombinant lactobacillus vaccine with SP was constructed to detect whether the targeting peptide can work in the chicken intestinal tract. pPG-VP2-SP group showed a significant protective effect according to the challenge test and gross lesions in the bursa. the avian mucosal immune system can supervise pathogens properly and be tolerant to commensal microbes. ae M11 was used as an antigen vector to deliver IBDV VP2 fused with SP as an oral vaccine. results indicated that anti-IBDV mucosal and humoral immune responses were induced efficiently via oral administration. therefore, chicken DCs targeting the protective antigen VP2 delivered by L. sae provide effective immune protection in chickens. click here for additional data file."}
