{"summary": "waterfowl parvovirus causes high morbidity and mortality in geese and Muscovy ducks. mortality rate ranges from 10 to 80%, and even up to 50%, resulting in economic losses to duck industry of china. pathogen isolation and identification and genomic sequence analysis were carried out to identify the exact pathogen that caused this disease. a novel nucleic acid amplification method\u2014loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) has attracted intense attention. it relies on auto-cycling strand displacement DNA synthesis by the Bst DNA polymerase large fragment with high strand displacement activity. results can be judged by either turbidity, or end-products that can be visible to naked eyes. detection method quantitative loop-mediated isothermal amplification (qLAMP) was established. specificity of this method was determined by GPV and other duck-origin viruses, such as duck plague virus, duck tembusu virus, duck hepatitis virus, duck reovirus, and H9N2-AIV. the supernatant were filtered through a 0.22 m filter. the filtrate was inoculated into duck embryo fibroblasts (DEF) cells. the culture supernatant was harvested after 5 days post-inoculated for three passages. covy duck Hungary X75093 U22967 Muscovy duck China Primer Design A set of four primers and PCR primers were designed using an online program. Primers including two inner (FIP and BIP), two outer (F3 and B3), and PCR primers are shown in Table 2. Primers for quantitative loop-mediated isothermal amplification (qLAMP) assay. qLAMP assay conducted in 25 L reaction system containing 1 L FIP and BIP primers (80 M of each), 1 L F3 and B3 primers (10 M of each), 2.5 L 10 Isothemal amplification buffer, 1.5 L 100 mM MgSO4, 3.5 L 10 mM dNTP Mix, 1.25 L 20 EvaGreen\u00ae dye, 1 L Bst DNA polymerase, 1 L target DNA, 11.5 L nuclease-free PCR conditions were as follows: 95\u00b0C for 5 min, 30 cycles of denaturation (95\u00b0C for 30 s), annealing (55\u00b0C for 30 s), extension (72\u00b0C for 30 s), followed by a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. qLAMP Assay Ten-fold series dilutions (107\u2013100 copies/L) of standard substance were used as templates for qLAMP amplification to confirm its sensitivity. sixty clinical liver samples and 60 cloacal swabs from dead ducks and clinical healthy ducks respectively were collected to test reliability of qLAMP, PCR assay, and virus isolation assay. GPV (HN strain), duck plague virus (ZB strain), duck plague virus (ZB strain), duck tembusu virus (GL strain), duck hepatitis virus (LC strain), duck reovirus (HB strain), Muscovy duck parvovirus (GX the reference waterfowl parvovirus isolates are listed in Table 1. phylogenetic relationship between SDLC and other waterfowl parvovirus strains based on the VP3 gene in the phylogenetic tree built using neighbor-joining method. clones were purified with a gel extraction kit (Takara, Dalian, China) and transformed into E. coli DH5 competent cells. high fidelity clone was cultured and extracted plasmid with Pureplasmid Mini Kit. qLAMP results were analyzed by gel electrophoresis with 2% agarose gel. PCR conditions were as follows: 95\u00b0C for 5 min, 30 cycles of denaturation (95\u00b0C for 30 s), annealing (55\u00b0C for 30 s) and extension (72\u00b0C for 30 s), followed by a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. was carried out using different viruses including GPV, duck plague virus, duck tembusu virus, duck hepatitis virus, duck reovirus, duck parvovirus, and H9N2-AIV. qLAMP assay, qLAMP assay, and Virus Isolation Sensitivity test was performed to validate specificity of this method. plasmid with different dilutions was used as templates for PCR detection. 88.7% with MDPV, which indicated evolutionary relationship of SDLC strain is closer to GPV stains, and N-GPV is a novel variant of GPV. the standard curve was generated by Tt values obtained from this study. a good linear relationship was established between the log of the plasmid copy numbers (copies/L) and the Tt values (R2=0.997) specificity of qLAMP assay Specificity test of qLAMP method was carried out by seven duck-origin viruses and a goose-origin virus. the results showed that our assay could only detect N-GPV and GPV, while no amplification signals were detected in other viruses. intra-assay variability of Tt value Mean SD CV (%) 1.0 107 20.37 0.15 0.74 20.36 0.17 0.82 1.0 106 25.38 0.23 0.91 25.16 0.49 1.96 1.0 105 30.03 0.54 1.81 30.00 0.50 1.96 1.0 104 34.65 0.52 1.50 34.49 0.78 2.25 1.0 103 41.11 0.56 1.37 40.72 0.38 2.05 1.0 102 46.02 0.73 phylogenetic tree of VP3 genes was constructed to determine genetic relationship between SDLC and other GPV and MDPV strains. phylogenetic trees based on VP3 genes showed that the SDLC strains were in the same branch with European GPV and vaccine isolates. only shared 80.4\u201388.7% with MDPV. the qLAMP method for N-GPV detection has the lowest limit of 102 copies. no amplification signals were observed in negative control (NC) qLAMP assay could not only be evaluated by naked eyes at the endpoint with EvaGreen\u00ae fluorescent dye in the UV light. qLAMP method has a high reproducibility and excellent stability in detecting N-GPV. results showed that the detection limit of qLAMP assay was 102 copies, while PCR assay was 104 copies. PCR, qLAMP, and virus isolation assay were performed on clinical samples and cloacal swabs of ducks from different regions of china. the sensitivity of qLAMP assay was the highest, and there was no positive amplification in negative control in qLAMP assay, PCR, and virus isolation assay. the novel EvaGreen-based quantitative LAMP assay has overcome these disadvantages and is more suitable for further application. it could be carried out in a water bath or on a real-time PCR instrument for quantitative analysis. the detection limit of this method was as low as 1.0 102 copies/L. authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
