{"summary": "the polyomaviridae are a family of small, nonenveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses that include simian virus 40 (SV40), mouse polyomavirus (mPyV), the human viruses BK virus (BKV), JC virus (JCV), and Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV). the polyomaviridae are a family of small, nonenveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses that include SV40, mPyV, and BKV enter cells via a clathrin-independent process. JCV uses clathrin-mediated endocytosis (9, 15, 37, 38) polyomaviruses bind to sialylated oligosaccharides on cells. SV40 VP1 pentamer bound to GM1 pentasaccharide binds to a shallow V-shaped groove. polysaccharides that bind to VP1 must be aligned in a Y shape to fit into the groove (36). SV40, BKV, and JCV share over 70% nucleotide sequence similarity with each other, it is believed that these viruses evolved from a common ancestor (21). GM1 and LSTc show that both bind sialic acid in the same orientation and with similar contacts. a small number of additional residues outside the sialic acid binding pocket also contact the oligosaccharide and enable each virus to specifically engage distinct oligosaccharide conformations and linkages. we used SV40 as a model to study how differences in VP1 might determine the receptors used for polyomavirus infection and cell tropism. we hypothesized that it would be possible to change the receptor used by SV40 by introducing mutations in the GM1 binding site on VP1. one of these viruses displayed altered cell tropism and infected cells with low cell surface GM1 more efficiently than wild-type virus. hybriddomas expressing polyclonal antibody (PAb) 108 mouse anti-large T antigen (purchased from ATCC), PAb 597 mouse anti-VP1 (obtained from Edward Harlow, Harvard Medical School) and PAb BH3-FG mouse anti-VP1 were cultured in DMEM plus 20% FBS and standard supplements. cells were infected with concentrated retroviral stocks of pSiren encoding appropriate shRNAs. SV40 776 genome present in either the pBR322 or the pHM1 vector is designated pSV776.1. the ligation reaction mixture was then ethanol precipitated and transfected into 293TT or CV-1 cells with either transIT 293 transfection reagent (Mirus, Madison, WI) or Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) primary virus stocks were generated by infecting CV-1 or 293TT cells with primary virus. pSiren vector expressing a nonspecific shRNA (shControl) was used as a control. retrovirus stocks were generated in 293T cells as described previously. SV40 infection and flow cytometry of large T antigen. the fraction of cells expressing large T antigen was measured using a 488-nm excitation and 530-nm emission filter. the cells were fixed in 10% formaldehyde and permeabilized in 10% formaldehyde with 0.2% Triton X-100. pSV776.1 library contained approximately 23,000 members with an average of 1 nucleotide substitution per VP1 gene. primary virus library stocks were generated by digesting 18 g of the pSV776.1 library with KpnI to liberate SV40 genomes. digestion products were then purified and transfected into four 25-cm plates of 293TT cells with 293 TransIT transfection reagent (Mirus) the resulting library consisted of approximately 380,000 bacterial transformants. the VP1 genes of 34 isolated clones were sequenced. 29 of 34 clones contained additional mutations with an average of 4.4 nucleotide changes per gene. infected CV-1 cells were treated with 2 ml of Hirt solution for 30 min. cells were then scraped in hirt solution and treated with 600 l of 5m NaCl. cellular DNA was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 20 min. VP1 genes were excised from Hirt genomes by digestion with AccI. 5 l of virus stocks was treated with 4 l of RQ1 DNase (Promega) in 100 l of DNase buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mM MgCl2) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. DNA was isolated by using a PCR purification kit (Qiagen) the extracted DNA was then diluted 1/100 in H2O. number of genomes present in each virus stock was calculated by comparing the critical threshold values of virus stocks to critical threshold values of 10-fold serial dilutions. qRT-PCR was performed by using iQ SYBR green Supermix with 40 ng cDNA per 20-l reaction mixture. glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase transcripts were detected using primers 5\u2032-CAGCCTCAAGATCATCAGCA-3\u2032 and 5\u2032 the culture was cooled to 25\u00b0C, protein expression was induced with the addition of 0.2 mM isopropyl--d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) cell pellets were resuspended in buffer L (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol, 5 mM dithiothreitol [DTT]) yacrylamide gel electrophoresis and coomassie blue staining confirmed VP1 pentamer formation. cells were washed with DMEM10 and treated with 0.25% trypsin. to neutralize the trypsin, the cells were washed with DMEM10 and chilled on ice for 15 min. CTXB binding was analyzed using a 488-nm excitation and 530-nm emission filter on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer. the ligation was then ethanol precipitated and transfected into CV-1 cells in triplicate. at 80 h posttransfection, virus was harvested by three rounds of freeze/thaw. the root mean square deviation (RMSD) values of the superimpositions were between 0.21 and 0.32 for all atoms of one binding site, indicating only very small structural changes in the area of the binding pocket surrounding residue 70 upon mutation. a two-tailed t test was used for all statistical analysis of data. monosialoganglioside GM1 from bovine brain was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Corp. (St. Louis, MO) monosialoganglioside GM1 from bovine brain was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Corp. shRNAs against GM3 synthase and glucosylceramide synthase were cloned into the pSiren retroviral vector (Clontech, CA) quent virus stocks were generated by infecting 293TT cells with primary virus. final high-titer virus stocks were prepared by using a modified Pava1 protocol described previously. cells were triedpsinized and washed with PBS. cells were then fixed by adding ice-cold methanol dropwise to the pellet. cells were blocked for 5 min in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) plus 0.5% bovine serum albumin. cell pellet was then resuspended in 100 l of a 1:1 mixture of 5% normal donkey serum in PBS. -VP1 were used to measure VP1 expression. the percentages of infected cells for each condition were corrected. GM1 supplementation assay. the VP1 gene was amplified by error-prone PCR with the VP1 primers 5\u2032-GTTCTAGGAGTTAAAACTGGAGTAGAC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-TCACTGCATTCTAGTGTTTGTCC-3\u2032. the PCR conditions were one cycle at 95\u00b0C for 2 min; 20 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 30 s, 50\u00b0C for 20 s, and 72\u00b0C for 90 s. the PCR products were then digested the primary library was cleared by infecting CV-1 cells with 2.1 106 infectious units (IU) of primary library at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI) (0.3) at 67 h postinfection, virus was harvested by freeze/thaw, and the titer was determined in CV-1 cells. at 3 days postinfection, virus was harvested by freeze/thaw. 293TT and CV-1 cells were infected with 3.5 106 infectious units of the library at an MOI of 0.3 to clear the library. at 2.5 (CV-1) and 3 (293TT) days postinfection, virus was harvested by freeze/thaw. 5.6 105 IU of virus was then treated with 12 M GM1 at 37\u00b0C for 30 min or left untreated. this process was repeated two times for a total of three rounds of selection. DNA was isolated from the samples by using a PCR purification kit (Qiagen) the extracted DNA was then diluted 1/100 in H2O. the number of encapsidated genomes isolated was measured by quantitative PCR (qPCR) GM3 synthase transcripts were detected using primers 5\u2032-CAGCCTCAAGATCATCAGCA-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CGATTGTGTCATGACGTTCTCTTA-3\u2032. VP1 pentamer expression and purification were performed as described previously. cells were grown at 37\u00b0C in 2 yeast extract and tryptone (YT) broth supplemented with ampicillin. ml lysozyme for 30 min on ice followed by DNase I (40 units supplemented with 5 mM MnCl2) treatment for 1 h. the cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation, and the supernatant was applied to a glutathione-Sepharose column equilibrated with buffer L. the protein was cleaved from the GST tag, still immobilized on the glutathione- the cells were washed two times with PBS and resuspended in 100 l of PBS. the cells were then resuspended in 200 l of PBS and kept on ice until analysis. VP1 binding was measured using a 488-nm excitation and 530-nm emission filter. the amount of virus produced was determined by qPCR. the structure of SV40 VP1 in complex with GM1 was uploaded into COOT (11), and residues A70, F75, H129, and N138 were mutated accordingly. energy minimization calculations were carried out for each of the two most likely rotamers of leucine, valine, and threonine. SV40 mutants with VP1 mutagenized by error-prone PCR used this library to identify the VP1 epitope recognized by neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. the library contains approximately 23,000 members, with an average of one nucleotide substitution per mutant. to identify mutant viruses that no longer required GM1 for infection, we selected mutant viruses that escaped neutralization by GM1. the efficiency of infection was measured by immunostaining and flow cytometry at 24 h p.i. the fraction of cells expressing large T antigen was measured by immunostaining and flow cytometry at 24 h p.i. and is displayed as percent infection relative to cells infected with the respective untreated virus. mutants were identified from 31 complete VP1 sequences. all mutants contained either an alanine-to-valine (27/31) or an alanine-to-threonine (2/31) substitution at residue 70 of VP1. most mutants also contained mutations at other positions. mutants were partially resistant to GM1 neutralization because only the VP1 fragment from the mutant genomes was cloned into the WT SV40 genome. the phenotype of the mutants can unequivocally be assigned to the mutations present in VP1. SV40 VP1 pentamer bound to GM1 is shown as ribbon tracings. arrow points to H129, a residue that is not located at the VP1 surface. GM1 is depicted in stick representation, with its -5-N-acetylneuraminic acid, glucose/galactose/N-acetylgalactosamine, and galactose moieties shown in magenta, dark gray, and green, respectively. mutations at A70 reduce the ability of SV40 to use GM1 for infection. SV40 mutant viruses are partially defective in their ability to be stimulated by addition of GM1 to cells and are less infectious than WT virus. fluorescently labeled CTXB binding is displayed as the percent mean fluorescence intensity relative to untreated CV-1 cells. asterisks indicate a significant difference between the fold increase in infection by mutant virus and the fold increase in infection of WT virus. SV40 mutants are resistant to GM1 neutralization and are impaired in their ability to infect the same number of CV-1 cells as WT virus. this decrease in infectivity likely represents a decrease in the ability of the mutant viruses to use GM1 for infection of CV-1 cells. however, we concluded that the mutant viruses continue to use GM1 for infection. the design of this screen is outlined in Fig. 4A. we first incubated the mutant A70L virus library with GM1. we then infected 293TT cells with either untreated or GM1-treated virus. a significant difference in the fold change in infection of cells treated with GM1 relative to untreated cells. ten unique mutant viruses were identified from 13 sequenced clones isolated from the untreated pool of virus. three unique mutants were identified from 12 clones sequenced from the untreated pool of virus. 83A/N138K 1 0 A70L/Q317H 1 0 A70L/A13V/N138Y 1 0 A70L/E160D/V184F 0 2 Total 13 12 Fig 11 Protein sequence alignment was conducted using PRALINE (http://www.ibi.vu.nl/programs/pralinewww/). asterisks indicate amino acids in SV40 VP1 that were mutated and shown to affect GM1 usage mutant viruses with an A70L mutation cannot bind to GM1 on the cell surface. mutant viruses with amino acid substitutions at residue 70 are resistant to GM1 neutralization and have a defect in their ability to be stimulated by adding GM1 to cells. mutants with a defect in their ability to be stimulated by adding GM1 to cells. GM1 addition also stimulated binding of intact WT capsids. however, the introduction of the A70L substitution prevented VP1 pentamers or capsids from binding to GM1 on the surface of cells. cells were left untreated (black lines) or treated with GM1 overnight (blue lines) and harvested with trypsin. infection by the A70L/F75L/H129Q mutant was increased 3.5- to 4-fold compared with WT virus in 293TT and HeLa S3 cells. this change in cell tropism appeared to be cell type specific rather than species specific, because the mutant viruses failed to infect primary human keratinocytes. in addition, neither the mutant viruses were able to infect primary human keratinocytes. K 293, vero, and LLC-MK2 cells were infected with 25,000 virions/cell of the WT or indicated mutant viruses. at 24 h p.i., infection was measured and is displayed as in panel A. similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. infections by the A70L and A70L/F75L mutant viruses were stimulated to similar extents by the addition of GM1 to HeLa S3 cells. infections by the A70L and A70L/F75L mutant viruses were stimulated to similar extents by the addition of GM1 to HeLa S3 cells, while the A70L/H129Q mutant virus was not stimulated. this data suggest that H129Q further interferes with the ability of SV40 infection was measured at 24 h p.i. and is presented as in Fig. 6A. similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. 3 cells using retrovirus transduction, and repression of GM3 synthase mRNA levels in these cells were confirmed by qRT-PCR. as expected, cells knocked down for GM3 synthase displayed significantly lower levels of surface GM1 than control cells. we infected these cells with equal numbers of WT and mutant virions and measured infection by flow cytometry. a second shRNA against GM3 synthase also inhibited WT GM1 overnight (gray bars) was infected with 25,000 virions/cell of SV40 and the indicated mutant viruses. the fraction of cells expressing large T antigen was measured by immunostaining and flow cytometry at 48 h p.i. the error bars indicate standard deviations. the number of infected cells with vacuoles was significantly reduced compared with cells infected with WT SV40 (32). in order to determine whether there was a consistent correlation between the ability of SV40 to interact with GM1 and its ability to induce the formation of vacuoles, we infected CV-1 cells with a panel of mutant viruses. genomes were excised from pSV766.1, religated into circles, and transfected into CV-1 cells. eighty hours later, virus was harvested by freeze/thaw. encapsidated genomes were then isolated from virus stocks. we treated three pools of mutant virus stocks with NeuNAc-GM1 for 15 min at 37\u00b0C and then infected CV-1 cells. after 3 days, virus was harvested, similarly treated with GM1 and used to infect CV-1 cells as before. this process was repeated two times for a total of three rounds of selection. expressing large T antigen was measured by immunostaining and flow cytometry at 24 h p.i. similar results were obtained in at least five independent experiments. full-length mutant virus genomes were excised from the vector and transfected into CV-1 cells. virus was harvested and treated with DNase to digest DNA that was not packaged into virus particles. equal numbers of virions were treated with GM1 or left untreated. SV40 VP1 pentamer is shown as ribbon tracings, with the surface of each monomer highlighted in a different color. the monomer with the most interactions with GM1 is colored blue, while the clockwise and counterclockwise monomers are highlighted in yellow and orange. side chains of residue 70 present in the main monomer and residue 138 present in the counterclockwise monomer are depicted in ball-and-stick mode. the terminal galactose moiety is displayed in stick representation, with carbon atoms labeled in green and oxygen atoms labeled in red. addition of GM1 to cells stimulated infection by WT virus 4.5-fold. infection by the A70 mutant viruses increased only 2- to 3-fold relative to untreated cells. SV40 VP1 mutant viruses are partially defective in their ability to be stimulated by addition of GM1 to cells. infection was measured as in Fig. 1B and is depicted as the percentage of cells expressing large T antigen. the results of a typical experiment are presented and represent the average of triplicate samples. library contained approximately 380,000 members with an average of approximately four nucleotide changes per VP1 gene. library was first passaged at low multiplicity in permissive cells to eliminate mixed capsids. incubation of 293TT cells with GM1 significantly increased infection. the results of a typical experiment are presented and represent the average of triplicate samples. similar results were obtained in six independent experiments. asterisks indicate a significant difference in the fold change in infection of cells treated with GM1 relative to untreated cells. accl-to-BamHI fragments of VP1 excised from harvested genomes, cloned, and sequenced Sequence No. of isolates Pool 1 (no GM1) Pool 2 (GM1) A70L 2 2 A70L/T273P 2 0 A70L/F75L/H129Q 1 0 A70L/T242A/T273P 1 0 A70L/Q74R 1 0 A70L/Q54 75L/H129Q mutant viruses are neither neutralized nor stimulated by GM1. we treated virus with GM1 or left virus untreated, then infected HeLa S3 cells. similar results were obtained when GM1 was added to 293TT cells. mutant viruses with an A70L mutation cannot bind to GM1 on cell surface. cells were left untreated or treated with GM1 overnight or left untreated. after removal of unincorporated GM1, the cells were harvested with trypsin. they were then incubated with recombinant VP1 pentamers on ice for 1 h. the cells were then washed to remove unbound pentamers, and bound VP1 was detected by immunostaining. the VP1 mutant virus has altered cell tropism. GM1 binding was eliminated by the VP1 mutations. however, the mutant viruses were still able to infect cells. similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. infection was measured by immunostaining and flow cytometry of large T antigen (CV-1 and HeLa S3 cells and HFFs) or VP1 (293TT cells) at 24 h p.i., infection was measured and is displayed as in panel A. the A70L mutant was reduced in all three cell lines compared with the WT. however, the mutants infected LLC-MK2 cells almost twice as well as WT virus. the mutants infected LLC-MK2 cells almost twice as well as WT virus. fected CV-1 and HeLa S3 cells were infected with 5,000 virions/cell. infection was measured at 24 h p.i. and is presented as in Fig. 6A. mutant viruses used gangliosides other than GM1. we used RNA interference to repress levels of GM3 synthase mRNA. a control shRNA (shControl) or an shRNA against GM3 synthase was stably expressed. the shRNA against GM3 synthase had no effect on infection by human papillomavirus type 16 pseudovirus. GM3 synthase mRNA levels in cells expressing a control shRNA and an shRNA against GM3 synthase were measured by qRT-PCR and normalized to GAPDH mRNA levels. similar results were obtained in two independent experiments. A70L SV40 infection was specific to inhibition of ganglioside synthesis. but even after GM1 treatment, the ability of SV40 mutants to infect knockdown cells was still dramatically reduced relative to cells expressing shControl. SV40 A70L/N138Y and A70L/F75L/H129Q mutant viruses require endogenous gangliosides for infection. a 70 mutant viruses have a defect in the ability to induce vacuolization of CV-1 cells. a confluent dish of CV-1 cells was either mock infected or infected with SV40 at an MOI of 0.25. eighty hours later, virus was harvested by freeze/thaw. mutant viruses in which the alanine at residue 70 was replaced with larger hydrophobic amino acids were resistant to GM1 neutralization. VP1 pentamers containing the mutation failed to bind to GM1 on the surfaces of cells, demonstrating that the mutation interfered with GM1 binding. poliovirus mutants are resistant to neutralization by soluble receptor (8). a library constructed in an A70L mutant backbone was screened in 293TT cells. two mutants recovered from this screen, A70L/N138Y and A70L/F75L/H129Q, were not stimulated. mutants contain additional substitutions at residues that directly interact with GM1. tyrosine side chain of the mutant will approach the hydroxyl groups of the terminal galactose moiety and impinge upon the binding pocket. the requirement for all three substitutions in the A70L/F75L/H129Q mutant virus for its change in tropism highlights the power of the genetic approach used here. the phenylalanine at position 75 is invariant and the histidine at position 129 is not directly located in the receptor-binding site. however, it was not possible to predict the constellation of substitutions that would alter ganglioside usage. most of the amino acid differences between the VP1 sequences from SV40, BKV, and JCV are located in the BC and DE loops. a limited number of amino acid substitutions at the GM1 binding site are sufficient to determine specific receptor recognition by SV40 and to alter cell tropism. a limited number of amino acid substitutions at the GM1 binding site are sufficient to determine specific receptor recognition by SV40. mutations that alter ganglioside usage can affect SV40 tropism. one mutation in the binding site allowed JCV VLPs to bind to two novel oligosaccharides in vitro (18), consistent with our conclusion that the A70L/F75L/H129Q SV40 mutant utilizes a different ganglioside receptor. SV40 has become one of the most intensely studied animal viruses. but little is known about how and why SV40 induces vacuolization. previously, SV40 failed to induce robust vacuolization in CV-1 cells."}
