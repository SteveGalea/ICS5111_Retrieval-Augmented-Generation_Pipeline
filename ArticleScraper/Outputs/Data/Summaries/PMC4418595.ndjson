{"summary": "CSF virus is a highly contagious viral disease of domestic pigs and wild boars. it is composed of a lipid envelope, a capsid and a single plus-strand RNA genome. the ORF encodes a polyprotein of approximately 3900 amino acids. it is processed by cellular and viral proteases in the four structural proteins C, Erns, E1, E2. evolution towards low virulent viruses in these regions was driven in part by a positive selection pressure linked to inefficient vaccination programs. however, the pathogenesis and disease progression after infection with low virulent CSFV isolates are poorly understood. there has been controversy over the importance of such congenital persistent infections in virus dissemination [22,23] in DMEM medium, supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS) pestivirus-free at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. the cells were infected with 0.1 TCID50/cell in 2% FBS. the virus was harvested 48 h later. the piglets were kept with their mothers during the 6 weeks of the experiment. serum samples were collected every week over the 6 weeks post-infection. nasal and rectal swabs were obtained at 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 weeks post-infection. a trained veterinarian recorded the clinical signs daily in a blinded manner. RNA in the serum and in nasal and rectal swabs, as well as tonsil, thymus and bone marrow samples was analysed by real time (RT)-PCR [36]. positive results were considered for threshold cycle values equal to or less than 42. samples in which fluorescence was undetectable were considered negative. the number and viability of the PBMCs were determined by staining with Trypan Blue. ELISPOT assay to detect CSFV-specific IFN- cells was performed as previously described. a polyclonal FITC-labelled anti-CSFV conjugate was used. for the cellular markers, the secondary antibody was R-phycoerythrin goat anti-mouse IgG. the cells were incubated for a further 45 min at 4\u00b0C. the gate strategy was applied in 90% of living cells using the forward and side scatter characteristics. for two colour immunolabelling, the same procedure was followed. to 2.5 105 cells/50 l/well, 50 l of SLA-II marker was added. the 6D10+ and 6D10 cells were more than 95% pure by flow cytometry. a total of 6701444 6D-10+ cells were recovered with 97% efficiency. a total of 6701444 6D-10+ cells were recovered with 97% efficiency. ELISPOT assay in the presence or absence of neutralising IL-10 clone. these cells were cultivated for duplication and were stimulated with mock, CSFV (Catalonia strain) at 0.1 MOI and PHA (10 g/mL) these experiments were repeated twice under the same conditions. the Pinar del Rio (PR) strain is a prototype low virulence CSFV isolate circulating currently in Cuba. it was isolated after more than 18.5 years of endemic CSF in Cuba. the strain belongs to the CSFV 1.1 genogroup. the procedure for the euthanasia of the animals was based on an accepted method included in European Directive 2010/63/EU. a trained veterinarian recorded the clinical signs daily in a blinded manner. the rectal temperature was recorded from 3 days after infection (after birth) until the end of the trial. the detection of E2-specific antibodies was performed using a commercial ELISA kit (IDEXX) the samples were considered positive when the blocking percentage was 40%. the cut-off value was calculated as the average of the optical density of negative controls. the controls were incubated in the presence of mock-stimulated wells. the numbers of spots in the media for mock-stimulated wells were considered to be the baseline for the calculation of antigen-specific frequencies of IFN-producing cells. 2.5 105 cells/50 l/well were labelled for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. anti-CSFV conjugate was diluted 1:100 in cold PBS with 2% FBS. cells were washed with cold PBS with 2% FBS by centrifugation at 4\u00b0C for 5 min. secondary antibody conjugated with R-phycoerythrin diluted 1:200 was added. FITC-labelled anti-CSFV conjugate and 6D10 hybridoma supernatants revealed with R-phycoerythrin conjugate were used. the positive percentages were analysed by FACSDiva software, version 6.1.2. a total of 2.5x105 PBMCs/well were stimulated at 37\u00b0C in 96-well plates. they were stimulated with mock, CSFV (Catalonia strain) at 0.1 MOI or PHA (10 g/mL) a total of 2.5x105 PBMCs/well were cultivated for duplication. fish\u2019s exact test was used to test the associations of the percentage of CSFV-positive piglets in serum, nasal and rectal swabs, and the tonsils and thymus among the experimental groups. pathogenicity of the two CSFV field isolates was studied in newborn piglets. the square symbol shows the mean value for PR group. values greater than 40\u00b0C were considered to indicate fever. an asterisk indicates a statistically significantly higher rectal temperatures in piglets infected with the PR strain. all of the piglets infected with cat01 had strong viral RNA signals in their serum 7 days after inoculation. at later time points, the viral RNA load further increased and remained high until the end of the experiment or until death or euthanasia. the three remaining piglets cleared the virus from their circulation by day 28 post-inoculation, as determined by real time RT-PCR. the viral RNA load in the nasal and rectal swabs was higher than for the PR-infected piglets at 14 days p.i. only. at necropsy, CSFV RNA was detected in the tonsils, thymus and bone marrow of all of the piglets infected with the Cat01 strain. 85% of the piglets inoculated on the day of their birth were not capable of clearing the virus within the 4 to 6 weeks RT-PCR in the tonsils, thymus and bone marrow are represented in black, grey and white colours. negative results were considered for CT values equal or less than 42. an asterisk indicates negative results in pigs 1, 3 and 14. 3 piglets (#1, 3 and 14) that cleared the PR virus were positive for E2-specific antibodies and virus-neutralising antibodies from 21 days p.i. onwards. the sows were also positive for both binding and neutralising antibodies. the cat01 virus induced a stronger antibody response than the PR virus in the sows. CSFV-specific IFN--producing cells were lacking in the piglets incapable of clearing CSFV PBMCs from all the piglets. a large proportion of CSFV-specific and PHA-responsive IFN--producing cells were detected in the PBMCs from the three PR-infected piglets that had seroconverted and from the two sows. the mean IFN- content was significantly higher in the piglets infected with the PR strain than in the piglets infected with the cat01 strain (P = 0.0046), although viraemia was lower. the three immunocompetent piglets responded with IFN- similar to that of the persistently infected animals. percentages of myeloid (CD172a+, CD163+) cells were clearly increased in both the PR and Cat01 virus-infected piglets. a higher percentage of immature granulocytes (6D10+) and CSFV+/6D10+ cells was found in the BMHCs from the cat01 virus-infected piglets. double labelling immunofluorescence image of the BMHCs from (i, ii and iii), in terms of CD172a common myeloid marker (y-axis) and SLA-II (x-axis). c) Percentage of granulocyte 6D10+ and 6D10+_CSFV+ double-positive cells in the BMHCs. s responded to IL-10 production with PHA mitogen stimulation. none of the pigs had detectable levels of IL-10 in the supernatant of sham-stimulated cells. PBMCs stimulated with Mock; CSFV Cat01 strain (MOI = 0.1) or PHA (1g/ml) PBMCs from pigs developing persistent CSF at 6 weeks post-infection (pigs 23, 25 and 27) and pigs 32 and 33 (non-infected pigs) were stimulated with mock, with CSFV strain Cat01. pathogenicity of the two CSFV field isolates was studied in newborn piglets. cross symbol shows the mean value for PR group. values greater than 40\u00b0C were considered to indicate fever. an asterisk indicates a statistically significantly higher rectal temperatures in piglets infected with the PR strain. all of the piglets had strong viral RNA signals in their serum 7 days after inoculation. at later time points, the viral RNA load further increased and remained high until the end of the experiment or until death or euthanasia. the three remaining piglets cleared the virus from their circulation by day 28 post-inoculation, as determined by real time RT-PCR. CSFV RNA was detected in the nasal and rectal swabs of all of the inoculated piglets until the end of the experiment or the day on which they were euthanised. the viral RNA load in the nasal and rectal swabs from the pigs infected with the Cat01 strain was higher than for the PR-infected piglets at 14 days p.i. only. at necropsy, CSFV RNA was detected positive results were considered for CT values equal to or less than 42. an asterisk indicates negative results in pigs 1, 3 and 14 in some of the tissues analysed. the infected and control pigs were analysed weekly for CSFV-specific antibodies. no detectable antibody response were found in the control pigs. a total of 5x105 PBMCs/well were plated in triplicates at 0.1 multiplicity of infection (MOI) of CSFV homologous strains. samples from pigs 17 to 27 and sow Cat were analysed at 19 dpi. a large proportion of CSFV-specific and PHA-responsive IFN--producing cells were detected in the PBMCs from the three PR-infected piglets that had seroconverted. piglets responded to CSFV infection with IFN- production. considerable but variable levels of serum IFN- were found in all of the animals mainly at day 7 p.i. and in some of the PR virus persistently infected piglets at 14 and 21 d.p.i. the fate and infection of the myeloid BMHCs were determined at necropsy in 6-week-old (i) non-infected piglets, (ii) seropositive piglets infected with the PR virus and (iii) seronegative piglets infected with the cat01 virus. percentages of myeloid cells were clearly increased in both the PR and cat01 virus-infected piglets. double labelling immunofluorescence image of the BMHCs from (i, ii and iii) in terms of CD172a common myeloid marker (y-axis) and SLA-II (x-axis). percentage of granulocytes 6D10+ and 6D10+_CSFV+ double-positive cells in the BMHCs. PBMCs from persistently infected and from uninfected pigs responded to IL-10 production with PHA mitogen stimulation. none of the pigs had detectable levels of IL-10 in the supernatant of sham-stimulated cells. PBMCs stimulated with Mock; CSFV Cat01 strain (MOI = 0.1) or PHA (1g/ml) in the presence or absence of the anti-IL-10 neutralising Ab. piglets were significantly increased in the presence of anti-IL-10 neutralising Ab. PBMCs from pigs developing persistent CSF at 6 weeks post-infection. pigs 32 and 33 (non-infected pigs) were stimulated with mock. severe thymus atrophy was the main gross pathological lesion. Interestingly, all of the persistently infected pigs were CSFV RNA positive in the thymus. however, a reduction in the number of PBMCs from these animals was also observed. thymus atrophy has been described in previous studies after CSFV congenital persistent infection with the Bergen strain. culated with the PR virus became immunocompetent, clearing the virus from sera after three weeks post-infection. only the sow in the Cat01 group was CSFV-positive from rectal and nasal swabs during the last four weeks of the trial. previous studies have shown that vaccine-challenged pigs that were not fully protected were CSFV in the tonsils after viral challenge. serum IFN- levels were measured in the persistently infected piglets. the persistently infected piglets inoculated with the PR strain had significantly higher serum IFN- levels than the cat01-infected pigs. this was different from acute CSFV infections, in which the serum IFN- levels were consistently higher with higher virus titres in the circulation. a previous study provided the ability of a highly virulent CSFV strain to induce detectable levels of IL-10 in the serum of pigs developing the acute form at 7 days post-infection. this finding could suggest that different roles are played by this cytokine in the two CSF forms. however, the CSFV- and PHA-stimulated PBMCs from persistently infected piglets produced high levels of IL-10. previous studies with the CSF acute form have shown that, after severe immunosuppression, SLAII+ cell populations decreased considerably [71]. Similarly, immature granulocytes, specifically 6D10+ cells [72], were the predominant cell population in these pigs. this is the first comprehensive study showing the ability of CSFV to generate viral persistence after early postnatal infection."}
