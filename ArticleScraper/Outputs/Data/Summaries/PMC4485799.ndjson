{"summary": "inflammatory CD4+ T cells (Th17) have also been implicated in the tumor microenvironment. interleukin 10 (IL-10) is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that is produced by a variety of cells including T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and cells of the myeloid lineage. expression of IL-10 in tumor cells or systemic administration of IL-10 resulted in inhibition of tumor growth 30-35 and the induction of CD8+ T-cell responses. IL-10 has been shown to directly stimulate in situ CTL expansion through the IL-10 receptor on CD8+ T cells. mice within 1 week and by 3 weeks after tumor cell injection all mice had large established tumors. the adaptive immune response caused the slower tumor growth in wild-type mice. the adaptive immune response caused the slower tumor growth in wild-type mice. IL-10/ and wild-type mice had similar numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the spleen. however, the number of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was significantly reduced in the tumors from IL-10/ mice compared to wild-type mice. depletion of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes in IL-10/ mice facilitates tumor rejection. four doses of anti-CD8 (53-6.72), anti-CD4 (GK1.5) or control antibodies (2A3 or LTF-2) were injected intraperitoneally into WT (A, C) and IL-10/ mice (B, D) at a dose of 400 g/per mouse at 4-day intervals beginning on day 1 after J558 tumor cell injection tumor-infiltrating CD4+ T cells expressed higher levels of inhibitory molecules including PD-L1 and CTLA-4. tumor-infiltrating CD4+ T cells expressed higher levels of inhibitory molecules including PD-L1 and CTLA-4. tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were stained for CD4 in combination with PD-1, PD-L1 or CTLA-4. depletion of CD4+ T cells in wild type mice did not result in dramatic tumor rejection. real-time PCR analysis revealed significantly elevated levels of IL-17 and IL-6 transcripts in IL-10\u2013deficient and wild-type tumors. increased expression of IL-6 was detected in tumor lysates from IL-10/ and WT mice. antibody (HRPN, n = 5) were injected into IL-10/ mice at a dose of 400 g/mouse/antibody. tumor size was measured over time. IL-6 is known to drive Th17 differentiation43 and stimulate tumor growth. IL-10\u2013deficient P1CTL cells have similar activation and effector functions. splenocytes from IL-10/P1CTL and IL-10+/+ P1CTL mice were cultured in the presence of different concentrations of P1A35-43. after 48 h, 3H-tritium was added and the plates were incubated for a further 12 h before harvesting and counting on a scintillation counter. mice receiving IL-10/ P1CTL cell treatment had significantly reduced numbers of P1CTL cells in their spleens compared to mice receiving IL-10+/+ P1CTL cells. thus, IL-10-deficient CTL cells fail to persist in tumor-bearing mice. adaptive immune response caused slower tumor growth in wild-type mice. IL-10/Rag2/ mice and IL-10+/+Rag2/ mice were challenged with the same J558 tumor cells. the adaptive immune response caused the slower tumor growth in wild-type mice. IL-10/ and wild-type mice had similar numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the spleen. however, the number of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was significantly reduced in the tumors from IL-10/ mice compared to wild-type mice. CD4+ T cells in both types of tumors largely failed to produce IFN-. depletion of CD4+ T cells in IL-10/ mice facilitates tumor rejection. four doses of anti-CD8 (53-6.72), anti-CD4 (GK1.5) or control antibodies (2A3 or LTF-2) were injected intraperitoneally into IL-10/ mice at a dose of 400 g/per mouse at 4-day intervals beginning on day 1 after J558 tumor cell injection. four to 5 mice were used per group. tumor-bearing mice were co-injected with IL-10-deficient P1CTL cells. CD4+ T cells from IL-10\u2013deficient mice strongly suppress CTL-mediated tumor rejection. IL-10-deficient CD4+ T cells expressed higher levels of inhibitory molecules. ting lymphocytes were stained for CD4 in combination with PD-1, PD-L1 or CTLA-4 followed by flow cytometry analysis. tumor rejection in IL-10\u2013deficient mice was unlikely to be due to Treg depletion. real-time PCR analysis revealed significantly elevated levels of IL-17 and IL-6 transcripts in IL-10\u2013deficient J558 tumors. increased expression of IL-6 was detected in tumor lysates from IL-10/ mice. increased expression of IL-6 was detected in tumor lysates from IL-10/ mice. five doses of anti\u2013IL-6 plus anti\u2013IL-17A (MP5-20F3+17F3, n = 5) or control antibodies (HRPN plus MOPC-21, n=5) were injected into IL-10/ mice at a dose of 400 g/mouse/antibody and tumor size was measured over time. IL-6 neutralization would affect tumor growth in IL-10\u2013deficient mice. IL-10\u2013deficient P1CTL cells have similar activation and effector functions to wild type counterparts. splenocytes from IL-10/P1CTL and IL-10+/+ P1CTL mice were cultured in the presence of different concentrations of P1A35-43. after 48 h, 3H-tritium was added and the plates were incubated for a further 12 h before harvesting and counting on a scintillation counter mice receiving IL-10/ P1CTL cell treatment had significantly reduced numbers of P1CTL cells in their spleens compared to mice receiving IL-10+/+ P1CTL cells. thus, IL-10-deficient CTL cells are defective in long-term persistence. IL-10\u2013deficient CTL cells have intrinsic defects in long-term persistence in tumor-bearing mice. plasmacytoma J558 tumors grew significantly faster in IL-10/ mice than in wild-type mice. a significant population of CD4+ T cells in tumors from IL-10/ mice was of the Th17 phenotype, which was present at significantly higher levels than among CD4+ T cells from WT tumors. this observation is consistent with previous reports that IL-10 signaling can directly inhibit Th17 cells24,46,47 or indirectly inhibit the production of inflammatory cytokines. IL-10 deficiency also reduced the suppressive activity of myeloid-derived suppressor cells against CD8+ T cells. these effects could lead to better activation of CD8+ T cells in the absence of suppressive CD4+ T cells. IL-10 deficiency significantly reduced the expression of IL-27\u2013induced survival molecules in CTLs. failure of IL-10\u2013deficient cells to persist in a tumor-bearing host is probably due to their poor survival potential. this observation is in line with the previous observation that IL-10 is critical for CTL memory. BALB/c mice with a targeted mutation of the Rag2 gene were purchased from Taconic Farms (Germantown, New York, USA) through breeding P1CTL TCR transgenic mice with Rag2/ BALB/c mice we have generated Rag2-deficient P1CTL TCR transgenic mice (Rag2/P1CTL) unbound cells consisted of more than 90% CD8+ T cells with no detectable CD4+ T cells. purified CD8+ T cells (5 106/mouse) were injected intravenously into mice bearing established tumors. first strand cDNA of each sample was synthesized using a reverse transcription kit (Invitrogen) cDNA was synthesized using an ABI 7900-HT sequence system (PE Applied Biosystems) with the QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen) each sample was assayed in triplicate and the experiments were repeated twice. Splenocytes from P1CTL TCR transgenic mice were stimulated with P1A peptide (0.1 g/mL) for 5 d. the effector T cells and the targets were incubated together for 6 h. a p value less than 0.05 was considered significant. IL-10 deficiency was confirmed by PCR genotyping using primers mIL-10. mice were maintained in lab animals that were fully accredited by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. tumor establishment and T-cell adoption therapy of mice with established tumors. gG1), 2A3 (rat IgG2a), LTF2 (rat IgG2b) and MOPC-21 (mouse IgG1) were all purchased from BioXCell. antibodies and flow cytometry FITC-, PE-, APC- or Percp-labeled antibodies were purchased from BD Biosciences. mIL-17: 5\u2032-CCTCCAGAAT GTGAAGGTCA-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-CTATCAGGGT CTTCATTGCG-3\u2032 (reverse) the HPRT gene was amplified as the endogenous control using the primers 5\u2032-AGCCTAAGAT GAGCGCAAGT-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-TTACTAGGCA GATGGCCACA-3\u2032 (reverse) funding This study was supported by a grant from the National Cancer Institute (R01CA138427)"}
