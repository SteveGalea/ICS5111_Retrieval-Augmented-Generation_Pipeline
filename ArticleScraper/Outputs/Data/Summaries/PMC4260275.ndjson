{"summary": "febrrile patients presenting with clinical features defining dengue with a history of travel to an endemic area constituted the study group. serum samples were tested for dengue-specific NS1 antigen and IgM, IgG antibodies. the demographic data were retrieved from the hospital information system. dengue fever (DF) is an acute febrile, arboviral disease caused by a Flavivirus. it is endemic in tropical and subtropical countries and accounts for 100 million cases annually. an estimated 40% of the world population is at risk. retrospective analysis was conducted of clinical suspects of dengue fever attending tertiary care facility between September 2012 and April 2013. patients presenting with sudden onset of fever and history of travel to dengue-endemic area defined a probable case of dengue fever. 189 clinical suspects, 128 were males and 61 females. of these clinical suspects, 58 were reactive to either NS1 antigen or IgM/IgG antibody or both together. the platelet count was noted in 39 patients, out of which 43.58% had a platelet count 100 109/L. patients with fever of five days, that is, acute phase, had normal counts of mild thrombocytopenia. only two patients had infection after exposure in low-lying areas of Himachal Pradesh. the disease usually begins with a sudden, sharp rise in temperature, invariably high grade, and is associated with chills as reported in 80% by Abdul et al. petechiae / ecchymosis (9-24.3%), epistaxis (9-8%), hematemesis/melena (6-9%), gum bleeding (3-9%), and vaginal bleeding (9.3%). a transient, morbilliform exanthem was seen in 30.7% patients, typically on the trunk and joint flexors, and constituted a primary presenting complaint rather than fever. NS1 antigen is a non-structural glycoprotein, highly conserved and essential for viability and replication of the dengue virus. detecting as early as one day post onset of fever up to 18 days expedites the time of diagnosis by 48-72 hours before appearance of antibodies with higher specificity. Thrombocytopenia is the leading predictor of dengue fever. 74.35% adults had low platelet counts. the levels correlated with the duration of disease and a consistent fall was observed with disease progression. 168 IU/L and 168 IU/L respectively occurred mostly in secondary dengue. low-lying areas are not free of disease transmission. febrile patients presenting during fall and early winter should be suspected for dengue."}
