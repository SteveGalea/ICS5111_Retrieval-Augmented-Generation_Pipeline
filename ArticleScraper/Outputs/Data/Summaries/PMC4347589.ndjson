{"summary": "the main clinical sign of PEDV is watery diarrhea with 100% morbidity and 50-100% mortality in piglets up to 1 week of age. the main clinical sign of PEDV is watery diarrhea with 100% morbidity and 50-100% mortality in piglets up to 1 week of age. a remarkable increase in PEDV outbreaks has been reported in pig-producing provinces in china. PEDV RNA attributed to airborne spread within a space housing experimentally infected pigs was reported. but because sentinel pigs did not succumb to PEDV infection, airborne transmission was not confirmed. pigs were housed in a 35 m3 animal isolation unit at the university of Minnesota. samples were collected by placing a cyclonic air collector in the isolation room 1.2 m above the floor. 62 samples were collected using an air cyclonic collector as described above for 30 min. samples were stored on dry ice and submitted to the UMN VDL for RT-PCR testing. 10-day-old pigs from a PEDV-negative farm were purchased and each pig allocated to a separate isolation room. pigs were rectal swabbed and confirmed negative by PEDV RT-PCR. clinical signs of diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration were monitored every 12 h throughout the bioassay. RNA was extracted from intestinal and environmental samples using the MagMAXTM-96 Viral RNA Isolation Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) the primer and hydrolysis probe set used the AgPath-IDTM one-Step RT-PCR Reagents (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) pigs infected with experimental air samples experienced moderate to severe diarrhea, with fecal number of RNA copies/mL ranging from 3.96 1010 to 7.57 1010. these pigs had histopathological lesions of moderate to marked atrophic enteritis. PEDV was considered exotic to the north american swine population until it was first diagnosed on April 2013. pigs inoculated with diluted air samples developed PED clinical signs and lesions. PEDV genetic material could be detected up to 10 miles. bioassay completed with air samples collected under experimental conditions demonstrated that PEDV could remain infectious while airborne. however, inoculation with samples collected under field conditions did not result in PEDV infection. further research is needed to determine the airborne infectious dose needed to induce PEDV infection. DM developed the diagnostic procedures and helped draft the manuscript. all authors read and approved the final manuscript. authors would like to thank Dr. Mark Engle, Dr. Rebecca Robbins and Dr. Luc Dufresne for assisting in the field study."}
