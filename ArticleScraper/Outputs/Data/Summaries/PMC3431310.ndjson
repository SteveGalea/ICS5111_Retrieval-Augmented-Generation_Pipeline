{"summary": "human bocavirus 1 (HBoV1) was initially identified in 2005, in nasopharyngeal aspirates of patients with acute respiratory-tract infections. it was found to be associated with ARTI in children, at a detection rate of 2\u201319% [2]\u2013[5]. HBoV1 is the fourth most common respiratory virus (after respiratory syncytial virus), adenovirus and rhinovirus) in infants less than 2 years of age BPV1 and minute virus of canines are prototypes of HBoV1 and mVC genomes. HBoV1 genome sequences previously appeared to exclude the two termini, and therefore, were incomplete [28]. in vitro HBoV1 infection has been reported only once in well-differentiated human airway epithelia. the genus Bocavirus A head-to-tail junction of an HBoV1 episome identified in an HBoV1-infected HAE [28], [29] was found to possess two sequences (3\u2032-CGCGCGTA-5\u2032 and 3\u2032-GATTAG-5\u2032) identical to parts of the BPV1 left-end hairpin (LEH) [32] we set up another PCR reaction with a forward primer located in the hairpin (FHBoV1 PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels. nucleotides in red represent sequences identified from the head-tail junction of an HBoV1 episome [28], [29], and nucleotides in black are the 5\u2032end and 3\u2032end sequences of the incomplete HBoV1 genome. a full-length HBoV1 clone (pIHBoV1) is capable of replicating and producing progeny virus in HEK293 cells. we then ligated and sequenced the non-structural (NS) and capsid (VP) protein-coding (NSVP) genes of the HBoV1 Salvador1 isolate from the patient-extracted viral DNA. pIHBoV1 replicated well in the absence of helper virus. pIHBoV1-transfected human airway epithelial cell lines BEAS-2B (Figure 2B, lanes 7&8), A549 and 16HBE14o- (Figure 2C), even in presence of adenovirus. replication in these cells appears to be non-existent or poor in these contexts. HEK293 cells were transfected with pIHBoV1 and its various mutants. at 48 h post-transfection, Hirt DNA was extracted and digested with (+) or without () DpnI, followed by Southern blotting using the HBoV1 dsDNA genome as a probe. pIHBoV1 transfection and CsCl equilibrium centrifugation were used to purify the virus that was produced. we found the highest HBoV1 gc (1\u20135108 gc/l) at a density of 1.40 mg/ml. purified virus displayed a typical icosahedral structure, with a diameter of 26 nm. immunofluorescence analysis of infected B31-11 HAE at 12 days p.i. showed that virtually all the cells expressed NS1 and NP1. a good portion of infected cells expressed capsid proteins (VP1/2; Figure 3C) the total virus yield from one millicell insert of 0.6 cm2 over a 24-h interval was greater than 21010 gc. this result suggested that productive HBoV1 infection of primary B-HAE is persistent. in the B-HAE cultures from both donors, virus was also continuously released from the basolateral side. the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) of mock- and HBoV1-infected primary B-HAEs was measured using an epithelial Volt-Ohm Meter (Millipore) at the indicated days p.i. averages and standard deviations are shown. HBoV1 infection of primary B-HAE features characteristics of respiratory-tract injury. infected B-HAE showed dissociation of ZO-1 from the periphery of cells started from 7 days p.i., compared with mock-infected B-HAE. expression of -tubulin IV was drastically decreased at 7 days p.i., and was not detected at 22 days p.i. invitrogen antibodies (A), or co-stained with anti-(HBoV1) NS1 and anti-tubulin IV (Sigma) antibodies (B), were taken at a magnification of 40. we found that productive HBoV1 infection disrupted the tight junction barrier, lead to the loss of cilia and airway epithelial cell hypertrophy. these are hallmarks of respiratory tract injury when a loss of epithelial cell polarity occurs IF analysis revealed that at 10 days p.i., HBoV1-infected CuFi-HAE was uniformly positive for NS1. the HBoV1-infected NuLi-HAE did express HBoV1 NS1, NP1 and VP1/VP2 proteins. the blot was reprobed sequentially with anti-NP1 and anti-actin antibodies. the same samples were separated and blotted with the anti-actin antibody. averages and standard deviations are shown. the head sequence is part of the HBoV1 LEH (nucleotides in blue; Figure 1A) together with a forward primer (FHBoV1_nt1), which anchors the 3\u2032 end of the HBoV1 genome predicted from the BPV1 LEH. only one specific DNA band was detected at approximately ()150-bp (Figure 1D, lane 1). PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels. nucleotides in red represent sequences identified from the head-tail junction of an HBoV1 episome [28], [29], and nucleotides in black are the 5\u2032end and 3\u2032end sequences of the incomplete HBoV1 genome. pIHBoV1 is capable of replicating and producing progeny virus in HEK293 cells. we cloned and sequenced the non-structural (NS) and capsid (VP) protein-coding genes of the HBoV1 Salvador1 isolate from the patient-extracted viral DNA. we then ligated the LEH, NSVP genes and REH into pBBSmaI. cells present at very low levels in pIHBoV1-transfected human airway epithelial cell lines BEAS-2B (Figure 2B, lanes 5&6), A549 and 16HBE14o- (Figure 2C), even in presence of adenovirus. replication in these cells appears to be non-existent or poor in these contexts. dRF DNA, double replicative form DNA; mRF DNA, monomer replicative form DNA. purified HBoV1 particles were negatively stained and examined. bar indicates 100-nm. HBoV1 progeny virus produced from pIHBoV1-transfected HEK293 cells is infectious. the infectivity of the HBoV1 virions purified from pIHBoV1-transfected cells was examined in polarized primary HAE. the primary B-HAE (B31-11) was cultured in millicell inserts and infected with purified HBoV1 at the apical surface. at 12 days post-infection, mock- and HBoV1-infected primary B-HAE cultures were fixed and analyzed by immunofluorescence (IF) using anti-(HBoV1) NS1 (A), NP1 (B), and VP1/2 (C) as indicated. the genomes of the progeny virions released from infected B-HAE were amplified and sequenced using primers spanning the NSVP genes between the termini. the result showed an identical sequence with that of the HBoV1 Salvador isolate (Genbank JQ923422). additionally, no virus was detected in mock-infected B-HAE (data not shown). pIHBoV1 transfection is capable of infecting polarized primary HAE cultures from cells derived from various donors and releasing identical progeny virions from infected primary HAE. infected B-HAE did not feature obvious cilia at 7 days p.i. and was significantly thinner than the mock-infected one on average at 22 days p.i. HBoV1 infection caused the loss of cilia in infected B-HAE. expression of -tubulin IV was drastically decreased at 7 days p.i. expression of -tubulin IV was not detected at 22 days p.i. in contrast to that in mock-infected B-HAE. cilia and airway epithelial cell hypertrophy are hallmarks of respiratory tract injury when a loss of epithelial cell polarity occurs. primary HAE cultures support HBoV1 infection but their usefulness is limited by the variability between donors, tissue availability and high cost. we thus explored alternative cell culture models for their abilities to support HBoV1 infection. infected NuLi-HAE did express HBoV1 NS1, NP1 and VP1/VP2 proteins. the kinetics of virus release from the apical surface was similar to that of a primary B-HAE infected with virus at a similar titer. HBoV1 infection also resulted in a decrease in the thickness of the epithelium. at 10 days p.i., mock- and HBoV1-infected CuFi-HAE membranes were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. images in panels A and F were taken at a magnification of 60. replication of HBoV1 DNA follows model of rolling hairpin-dependent DNA replication of autonomous parvoviruses. recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV; in genus Dependovirus of the family of Parvoviridae) infects HAE apically and expresses reporter genes. polarized ciliated primary HAE is generated by growing isolated tracheobronchial epithelial cells at an ALI for on average one month. this model system recapitulates important characteristics of interactions between respiratory viruses and their host cells. HBoV1 infection of primary B-HAE was persistent and caused morphological changes. the induction of leakage by HBoV1 also suggests a mechanism that accounts for the viraemia observed in HBoV1-infected patients. further disease pathology could be accounted for by infection-induced loss of cilia of the airway epithelia; a lack of cilia is often responsible for bronchiolitis [64]\u2013[66]. our study with the laboratory-produced HBoV1 Salvador1 represents infection of HBoV1 of clinical specimens in HAE. the MOI used for infection in the current study was high. however, it should be noted that this titer is based on the physical numbers of virion particles. it should also be taken into consideration that extensive parvovirus inactivation occurs during the purification process, i.e. during CsCl equilibrium ultracentrifugation. HBoV1 infection of CuFi-HAE reproduced disruption of the barrier tight junctions like that seen also in primary B-HAE. the absence of virus on the basolateral side implies that in HAE the secretion of HBoV1 is apically polarized. further studies will focus on understanding the permissiveness of CuFi-HAE to HBoV1 infection and on the reason for the ease of infection of an HAE with a cystic fibros our system mimics natural HBoV1 infection of the in vivo human cartilaginous airway epithelia. pathogenesis of HBoV1 in co-infection with other respiratory viruses and in conditions of lung diseases is a focus of future study. human airway epithelium cultures polarized primary B-HAE. polarity of the HAE was determined based on the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) using an epithelial Volt-Ohm Meter. a value of over 1,000.cm2 was required for HBoV1 infection. sequence of the head-to-tail junction of the HBoV episome suggests that HBoV LEH and REH share similarities in structure and sequence with that of the BPV LEH and MVC REH respectively [27], [29]. based on this information, we designed primers to amplify the HBoV1 termini, which are shown in Table 1 and Figure 1. nucleotides underline are HBoV1 sequences or sequences complementary to the HBoV1 sequence. nucleotides shown in bold fonts are sequences containing restriction enzyme sites and random sequences used to optimize PCR reactions and cloning.
