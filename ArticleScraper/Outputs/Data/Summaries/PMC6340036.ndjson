{"summary": "a total of 26,000 suspected cases of ZIKV disease in pregnant women were reported between January 2016 and June 2017 in Brazil. more than one-third of 582 fetal deaths after birth or during pregnancy and cases of microcephaly or other fetal malformations of the central nervous system were found to be associated with ZIKV infection of the mothers during pregnancy. development of a prophylactic vaccine that also prevents fetal ZIKV infection during pregnancy is regarded as urgent. ZIKV is named after the location of its first isolation in 1947, the Zika Forest in Uganda (7). it initially drew little attention due to the historically generally mild or asymptomatic course of infection (8, 9) however, the virus was detected during an outbreak on Yap Island in micronesia in 2007 (10) and was introduced into south America in 2014. the development of a live-attenuated vaccine strain for a newly emerging pathogen is time-consuming and has an inherent risk of failure due to lack of proper and stable attenuation. well-characterized safe and efficacious vaccine strains can be genetically engineered to present critical antigens of the emerging pathogen of interest. a recent example is the Ebola vaccine, which showed efficacy in a phase III trial (25) recombinant MV encoding a soluble form of the ZIKV envelope protein was codon optimized and generated by gene synthesis. two vaccine clones of so-called MV-Zika-sE were purchased after generation and sequence verification of the clones. a truncated version of the ZIKV E protein gene lacking the stem-anchor region, resulting in sE, was inserted together with the prM gene preceded by the C-terminal signal peptide of the capsid (C) sequence, indicated by a black bar, into an additional transcription unit following the P gene cassette of the MVSchw genome. MV-sE#4 and MV-sE#11, respectively, were obtained and used for further characterization. expression of the green fluorescent protein in MV-Zika-sE-infected Vero cells was demonstrated by immunostaining but was also detectable in the cell culture supernatant. possible differences in expression levels were analyzed via immunoblot analysis. cell-associated virus titers peaked at 3 dpi at approximately 1 106 TCID50/ml. recombinant MVSchw encoding soluble form of the E protein induces ZIKV E-specific humoral immune responses. anti-ZIKV antibodies induced by MV-Zika-sE 21 days after boost immunization were comparable for both analyzed vaccine clones. the neutralization capacities of anti-ZIKV antibodies induced by MV-Zika-sE were comparable for both analyzed vaccine clones. serum samples of unvaccinated or control-vaccinated mice did not neutralize ZIKV (PRNT50 20) MV-sE#4 and MV-sE#11 are depicted as light- and dark-blue triangles. MV-GFP is depicted as green squares. to assess coinduced anti-measles virus immunity, all sera were analyzed. the splenocytes of all but two mice revealed similar general reactivities exceeding 500 spots per 1 106 splenocytes after stimulation with concanavalin A (ConA) cells from all but one MV-immunized animal exceeded 500 spots per 1 106 splenocytes after restimulation with MV bulk antigen. cells from all but one MV-immunized animal produced IFN- upon restimulation with ZIKV E protein. at least 50% of splenocytes proliferated after stimulation with conA. splenocytes of mock- or MV-GFP-vaccinated mice showed no reactivity. bivalent MV/ZIKV vaccine candidates induced robust anti-measles virus immunity. female IFNAR/-CD46 mice (n = 16 or 17) were immunized twice with the respective vaccine, MV-sE#11; vector control, MV-GFP; ZPIV (n = 6); or medium (mock) in a prime-boost setup. additional inclusion of MV-sE#4 in this in vivo experiment was considered redundant. weight curves (D) and spleen sizes (E) of pregnant mice mated at least 21 days postvaccination and challenged at E7.5 reveal symptoms of ZIKV infection. one naive control animal was excluded from analysis due to a hematological disorder. the pregnancy of plug-positive dams was monitored by weight gain. mice presumed to be pregnant were infected with 1 103 TCID50 ZIKV. dams immunized with the bivalent MV/ZIKV vaccine candidate gained weight. mice immunized with MV-GFP and ZPIV-immunized mice showed comparable kinetics of plasma viremia in both timing and absolute genome copy numbers. in most of the remaining animals, viral RNA was detected only on day 5 postinfection, with peak ZIKV genome copy numbers about 1 or 2 log units lower than in the other groups. there was no obvious inverse correlation between the levels of ZIKV E protein-binding IgG and the appearance of vir fetuses of dams vaccinated with bivalent MV/ZIKV vaccine candidate MV-sE were smaller and paler than fetuses of noninfected controls. fetuses of dams vaccinated with MV-sE were as pale and small as fetuses of infected, mock-vaccinated dams. fetus vaccinated with bivalent MV/ZIKV vaccine candidate MV-sE protected fetuses from growth retardation observed in control- and ZPIV-vaccinated animals. vaccination of dams with MV-sE strongly reduced placenta weight and high viral loads, with the viral load in the placenta reaching slightly higher titers. fetuses from MV/ZIKV-vaccinated pregnant mice are protected during ZIKV challenge. animals vaccinated with MV-sE are depicted in blue, MV-GFP in green, and mock-vaccinated animals in black. two vaccine clones of so-called MV-Zika-sE were purchased after generation and sequence verification of the clones. for generation of the bivalent MV/ZIKV vaccine, a truncated version of the ZIKV E protein was designed that lacks the stem-anchor region of E. for proper expression and folding of the flaviviral E proteins, the pre-membrane protein (prM) is needed (30) ZIKV E protein expression in MV-Zika-sE-infected Vero cells was verified via immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA) (B) or Western blot analysis (C) directly comparing two clones of MV-Zika-sE encoding soluble E (MV-sE#4 and MV-sE#11) to control MVSchw virus encoding GFP (MV-GFP) the blots and only vero cells infected with MV-sE#4 and MV-sE#11 revealed specific expression of ZIKV E protein in these areas. recombinant MVSchw encoding soluble form of the E protein mediated expression of a soluble form of the E protein in all infected cells. IFNAR/-CD46 mice (n = 4 to 6) were vaccinated with both clones, the control MV-GFP, or medium (mock) in a prime-boost regimen at days 0 and 21, each time with 5 104 TCID50. the induction of ZIKV-specific humoral immune responses was analyzed using a ZIKV prM- or E-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) IFNAR/-CD46Ge mice (n = 4 to 6) were immunized with 5 104 TCID50 of the ZIKV vaccine clone MV-sE#4 or MV-sE#11. serum samples of unvaccinated or control-vaccinated mice did not neutralize ZIKV (PRNT50 20) all sera of mice vaccinated with MV contained similar levels of neutralizing antibodies against MV of about 400 to 800 VNT. immunization with both MV-sE vaccine clones robustly induced ZIKV E protein-specific IgG that conferred neutralizing activity against ZIKV while still inducing humoral anti-measles virus immunity. IFNAR/-CD46Ge mice were immunized with 5 104 TCID50 of the ZIKV vaccine clone MV-sE#4 or MV-sE#11, MV-GFP control virus, or medium (mock) on days 0 and 21. no reactivity to control stimulation using ovalbumin was observed. in splenocytes isolated from MV-Zika-sE-vaccinated mice, 40% of splenocytes proliferated after stimulation with ZIKV E protein. splenocytes of mock- or MV-GFP-vaccinated mice showed no reactivity above unspecific control stimulation. bivalent MV/ZIKV vaccine candidates induced antibodies with neutralizing activity. vaccination with the bivalent MV-sE induced ZIKV E protein-specific IgG at levels around 1,400 U/ml. vaccination with ZPIV resulted in titers around 270 U/ml. all but one MV-vaccinated mouse developed robust MV-specific neutralizing antibodies. animals vaccinated with MV-sE#11 are depicted in blue, MV-GFP in green, ZPIV in orange, mock-vaccinated animals in black, and uninfected naive controls in gray. ns, not significant; ns, not significant; *, P 0.01; **, P 0.01; ****, P 0.0001. dams immunized with the bivalent MV/ZIKV vaccine candidate gained weight at the same rate as noninfected pregnant control mice. mock-immunized animals or mice immunized with MV-GFP or MV-GFP control showed a statistically significant delay in weight gain. at the end of the experiment, splenomegaly was observed in mice vaccinated with MV-GFP or ZPIV or mock vaccinated animals. ized mice showed comparable kinetics of plasma viremia in timing and absolute genome copy numbers. in most of the remaining animals, viral RNA was detected only on day 5 postinfection, with peak ZIKV genome copy numbers about 1 or 2 log units lower than in the other groups. there was no obvious inverse correlation among mice immunized with MV-sE between levels of ZIKV E protein-binding IgG and the appearance of viremia. fetuses from dams vaccinated with the bivalent MV/ZIKV vaccine candidate MV-sE were as pale and small as fetuses of infected, mock-vaccinated dams. fetuses of dams vaccinated with the bivalent MV/ZIKV vaccine candidate MV-sE were as pale and small as fetuses of infected, mock-vaccinated dams ZIKV infection of mock-, MV-GFP-, and ZPIV-immunized dams resulted in significantly reduced placenta weight and high viral loads. placentas from dams vaccinated with the bivalent MV/ZIKV vaccine candidate MV-sE were similar to those of uninfected dams. vaccination of dams with MV-sE strongly reduced the viral load in the placenta. animals vaccinated with MV-sE are depicted in blue, MV-GFP in green, ZPIV in orange, mock-vaccinated animals in black, and uninfected naive controls in gray. one uninfected animal (same as in Fig. 4) and her fetuses were excluded from analysis due to a hematological disorder. more than half of the immunized mice were completely protected from ZIKV infection, as illustrated by absence of viremia. inactivated alum-adjuvanted alum-adjuvanted ZIKV vaccine resulted in antibody induction in vaccinated animals but did not confer protection after challenge. the protective MV Schwarz strain-derived recombinant vaccine MV-Zika-sE encodes a soluble version of the ZIKV the MV vaccine candidates under investigation are based on either direct vaccination with E protein, expression of E protein, or viral particles (36). the failure of ZPIV observed in our experiments was likely due to the overall very low IgG titers induced. viremia in plasma and several organs was consistently lower than in MV-Zika-sE-vaccinated mice with similarly low antibody titers. a mouse strain for analyzing immunity induced by MV-derived vaccines may be found in the deficiency of the mice in reacting to type I interferons. the presence of human CD46 (hCD46) has recently been shown to be dispensable in overcoming the host restriction of MV in mice. the bivalent MV/ZIKV vaccine candidate has a number of desirable properties. the concurrent induction of anti-MV immunity would allow its use in the context of routine measles immunization schedules. MV-Zika-sE is a promising vaccine candidate that warrants further investigation. a prototypic MV-based vaccine targeting ZIKV was purchased from Themis Biosciences GmbH (Vienna, Austria) the gene encoding the sequence of ZIKV E protein was modified to be expressed in a soluble form by deleting the whole stem-anchor region via truncation of the open reading frame. the whole sequence was generated by gene synthesis (Eurofins Genomics, Ebersberg, Germany) vero cells were seeded in T175 flasks and infected at a confluence of 70% and an MOI of 0.001 in 10 ml serum-free DMEM containing 2 mM l-glutamine for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. after removal of the inoculum, 40 ml of DMEM containing 2 mM l-glutamine and 2% FBS was added. serum proteins were removed from the virus pellet resuspended in 150 l phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as described previously (50) using Capto Core 700 slurry. 1 ml washed slurry was mixed with 1 ml PBS, and 250 l of this suspension was mixed with 900 l virus suspension for 1 h at room temperature. a polyclonal rabbit anti-ZIKV envelope protein antibody (1:10,000; GTX133314; GeneTex, Irvine, CA) was used as the primary antibody for ZIKV E protein and a rabbit anti-MV N polyclonal antibody (1:25,000; Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom) for MV N. mice with knockout of the type I interferon receptor and heterozygous for human CD46 (38) were immunized in a prime-boost setup on days 0 and 28. mice were vaccinated via intraperitoneal (i.p.) route with either 5 104 TCID50 of recombinant MV (in a 200-l total volume), 200 l Opti-MEM (mock), or subcutaneously (s.c.) with serum samples diluted 1:100 or 1:500 in low-NSB sample diluent buffer provided within the ELISA kit from mice euthanized 3 weeks after boost. anti-mouse IgG HRP-coupled antibody was added for 30 min, followed by 5 washing steps. DMEM and 50 PFU of MVvac2-GFP(P) (53) were added to the serum dilutions. the infected cultures were incubated for 4 days at 37\u00b0C. PRNTs were calculated as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution completely abolishing infection. the splenocytes were restimulated with either 10 g/ml ZIKV E protein (Creative Diagnostics, Shirley, NY) or 10 g/ml ovalbumin as the protein control. the plates were incubated with biotin-conjugated anti-IFN- antibodies and then with avidin-HRP according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. labeled cells (5 105) were seeded in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% mouse serum, 2 nM l-glutamine, 1 mM HEPES, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 100 M 2-mercaptoethanol. cells were restimulated as described previously (52) with ConA (10 g/ml), MV bulk antigens (10 g/ml) and medium or ovalbumin (10 g/ml) served ZIKV RNA, as well as external EAV RNA, was detected in serum samples and tissues via multiplex quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) qPCRs were performed in a 96-well format with 5 l of RNA in a total volume of 20 l run in triplicate on a CFX 96 qPCR cycler. a prototypic MV-based vaccine targeting ZIKV was purchased from Themis Biosciences GmbH (Vienna, Austria) the gene encoding the sequence of ZIKV E protein was modified to be expressed in a soluble form by deleting the whole stem-anchor region via truncation of the open reading frame at nucleotide 2184 of the viral genome. 293-3-46 cells stably expressing T7 polymerase and the MV proteins N and P were transfected with the recombinant MV genomes and a plasmid encoding MV polymerase L. single syncytia were picked and further passaged up to passage 8. the GFP-encoding control vaccine MVSchw-GFP has been described previously. formalin-inactivated ZIKV particles normalized to 1 g ZIKV E protein per mouse were extensively mixed with 500 g Al(OH3) before vaccination, formalin-inactivated ZIKV particles normalized to 1 g ZIKV E protein per mouse were extensively mixed with 500 g Al(OH3. a polyclonal rabbit anti-ZIKV envelope protein antibody (1:10,000; GTX133314; GeneTex, Irvine, CA) was used as the primary antibody for ZIKV E protein and a rabbit anti-MV N polyclonal antibody (1:25,000; Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom) for MV N. a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-coupled donkey anti-rabbit IgG(H+L) polyclonal antibody the cells were washed 3 times with 1 ml PBS and washed 3 times again. for detection, the cells were stained with TrueBlue peroxidase substrate solution. mice with knockout of the type I interferon receptor were immunized in a prime-boost setup on days 0 and 28. cinated mice were mated allogeneically with male BALB/c mice. successful mating was verified by plug check on the following day. mice were infected 8 days postmating with 1 103 TCID50 of PF/2013/251013-18 applied s.c. in 100 l Opti-MEM. the optical density (OD) was measured at 450 nm with a reference wavelength of 630 nm. the quantification of VNT targeting MV was done as previously described (52). duplicates of mouse sera were serially diluted in 2-fold dilutions in DMEM. 50 PFU of MVvac2-GFP(P) (53) were added to the serum dilutions. the splenocytes were restimulated with either 10 g/ml ZIKV E protein (Creative Diagnostics, Shirley, NY) or 10 g/ml ovalbumin as the protein control. the plates were incubated with biotin-conjugated anti-IFN- antibodies. Spots were counted using an Eli.Scan ELISpot scanner (A.EL.VIS, Hamburg, Germany) and ELISpot analysis software (A.EL.VIS) wells with too many spots to be separated were set to >1,200 spots. RNA was eluted from the column with 60 l. about 30 g of frozen tissue samples were homogenized in 600 l RLT Plus buffer in 2 ml Lysing Matrix D tubes. samples were spiked before RNA extraction with external equine arteritis virus (EAV) RNA provided in the lightMix Modular EAV RNA extraction control 660 kit. reverse transcription for 300 s at 55\u00b0C followed by denaturation for 300 s at 95\u00b0C. 45 cycles of 5 s at 95\u00b0C, 15 s at 60\u00b0C and 15 s at 72\u00b0C. final cooling step was 30 s at 40\u00b0C."}
