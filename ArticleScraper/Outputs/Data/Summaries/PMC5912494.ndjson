{"summary": "a retrospective chart review was performed of all the patients admitted to the acute MERS inpatient unit at the NMC during the 2015 outbreak. results 30 (75%) were confirmed to be MERS-CoV positive among 40 admitted cases. a large outbreak of MERS-CoV infection occurred in south Korea between May and July 2015. data from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreaks showed that quarantined patients developed psychiatric symptoms that required psychiatric management. little is known about the psychiatric complications or risk factors for depression in suspected or confirmed MERS patients. mental health services were offered to all of the MERS inpatients from day 1. one protocol was used for the daily psychiatric telephone rounding and one was a package of checklists for the patients. the checklist package was given to the patient after medical examinations and history taking was done. participants were asked to indicate the extent to which each item distressed or bothered them over the last 7 days using a rating scale of 0\u20134. the Korean IES-R has shown good reliability (Cronbach alpha coefficient=0.93), test-retest reliability (Cronbach alpha coefficient=0.91), and validity for the assessment of PTSD symptom severity. most measures of distress are derived from pre-existing structured tools that capture the amount of stress or change associated with stressful events. Pearson\u2019s correlation analysis was used to examine the correlations among psychological measures. the null hypothesis was rejected at p0.05. the threshold for twosided significance tests was p0.05. the checklist package was given to the patient after medical examinations and history taking was done. a psychologist called all of the patients to ask the questions on the checklist. this allowed collecting and assessing the checklist without direct contact. a psychologist collected data on the second hospital day using a smartphone. patients with poor physical or mental status were excluded from the psychological assessment using the structured instruments. the IES-R has been shown to be reliable and valid tool for the screening and assessment of depressed patients. the PTD-PTNB-PTSS is a shortened version of the posttrauma risk checklist. the PRC consists of 57 items that measure PTD, PTNB, and PTSS. the scale comprises 18 items selected from the PRC. in total, 20 (58.8%) of the surviving confirmed and suspected MERS patients reported previous medical conditions and three (8.8%) reported previous psychiatric disorders. 17 (70.8%) exhibited psychiatric symptoms and 10 (41.7%) received a psychiatric diagnosis. 14 patients complained of experiencing: insomnia (n=7), depressive mood (n=5) and tension (n=9). one patient had been infected by her father, whom she had nursed in the hospital. her father had died of MERS-related complications. she was unable to attend his funeral, as all deceased patients were cremated. t=-2.187, df=25, p=0.038 Marital status, N (%) 2=4.120, p=0.127 Single 11 (40.7) 5 (27.8) 6 (66.7) Divorced/separated 2 (7.4) 2 (11.1) 0 (0) Married 14 (51.9) 11 (61.1) 3 (33.3) Education, N (%) 2=0.750, p=0.667 High school or lower 9 (33.3) 7 (38.9) 2 PTSS scores were not significantly different between groups (Table 2). PTSS scores were significantly positively correlated with the KNHANES-short form (r=0.814, p0.001), IES-R (r=0.679, p0.001), and PTD (r=0.627, p0.001). the IESR, PTD, PTNB, and KNHANES-short form scores yielded an adjusted R2 value of 0.693 (F=12.747, p0.001) the analysis revealed only the KNHANES-short form and IES-R scores were significantly positively correlated with PHQ-9 scores. 0.808 KNHANES-short form 0.485 0.118 0.730 4.120 0.001 IES-R 0.167 0.063 0.473 0.642 0.015 PTD -0.113 0.251 -0.080 -0.451 0.656 PTNB -0.297 0.186 -0.267 -1.597 0.125 R2=0.744, Adjusted R2=0.697, F=15.947, p0.001 PHQ-9: Patient Health 27 (79.4%) survivors completed the psychological assessment. of those, 18 (66.7%) were confirmed and 9 (33.3%) were suspected MERS cases. 15 (55.6%) patients reported previous medical conditions and 2 (7.4%) reported previous psychiatric disorders. 2 (7.4) 2 (11.1) 0 (0) Married 14 (51.9) 11 (61.1) 3 (33.3) Education, N (%) 2=0.750, p=0.667 High school or lower 9 (33.3) 7 (38.9) 2 (22.2) More than high school 18 (66.7) 11 (61.1) 7 (77.8) Health care provider*, N (%) 2=4.747, p=0.046 Yes 13 (48.1) 6 (33.3) 7 (77.8) No 14 (51.9) 12 patients with depression (PHQ-9 5) included 8 subjects (29.6%) with mild depression (PHQ-9, 5\u20139), 2 (7.4%) with moderate depression (PHQ-9, 10\u201314) and 1 (3.7%) with severe depression (PHQ-9, 20\u201327). the IESR, PTD, PTNB, and KNHANES-short form scores yielded an adjusted R2 value of 0.693 (F=12.747, p0.001) the analysis revealed that only the KNHANES-short form and IES-R scores were significantly positively correlated with PHQ-9 scores. about 70% of confirmed MERS patients exhibited psychiatric symptoms. about 40% received psychiatric diagnoses and were prescribed medication. 14 of 24 MERS patients had mild psychiatric symptoms such as insomnia, depressed mood, and tension. 5% of SARS survivors reported moderate-to-severe or severe anxiety and/or depressive symptoms 1 year after recovery. current prevalence for any psychiatric disorder 30 months post-SARS is 33.3%. Relevant biological factors may be weight loss of 10 kg to 20 kg [11], antiviral agent side effects [12], pre-existing disabilities. our findings suggest the need to increase mental health services during acute treatment phase of EIDs and to conduct follow-up studies in survivors."}
