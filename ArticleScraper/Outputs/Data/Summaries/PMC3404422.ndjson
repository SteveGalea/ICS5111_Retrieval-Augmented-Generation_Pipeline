{"summary": "more than 400,000 new cases of heart failure are diagnosed each year. advances in pharmacological treatments including -blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers have decreased hospitalizations. restoring SERCA2a levels using adenoviral vectors or adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors has been shown to improve function, metabolism, and/or survival in small and large animal models of heart failure. a phase 1/2 clinical trial (CUPID; Celladon, La Jolla, CA), testing the safety and efficacy of catheter-based cardiac delivery of AAV1-hSERCA2a (Mydicar) in patients with advanced heart failure, has met a trial using the canine model of tachycardic pacing-induced heart failure was performed to test the safety and efficacy of delivering AAV6-hSERCA2a. a limited immunosuppressive therapy blunted the immune responses and allowed persistent long-term transgene expression. hSERCA2a-specific peptides Splenocytes or peripheral blood mononuclear cells were cultured with each of 2 pools containing 10 or 11 peptides encompassing the 8 amino acid residues that differ between canine and human SERCA2a. dogs received saline (n=2) or hSERCA2a (n=2) before euthanasia. negative control wells contained PHA (phytohemagglutinin, M form; Gibco-Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY), and medium. each condition was assayed in triplicate. anti-human Serca2a antiserum Antibody specific to human SERCA2a was prepared by immunization of rabbits with a human SERCA2a peptide. antibodies cross-reactive to canine SERCA2a were removed by chromatography of the serum. a value of p0.05 was considered significant. results study design The planned clinical trial will consider delivery of hSERCA2a to patients receiving a ventricular assist device for end-stage heart failure. the dogs were placed on cardiopulmonary bypass (without circulatory arrest) and AAV6-hSERCA2a (n=11) or solvent (n=4) was delivered as described previously. a VAD-supported patient, who had received the proposed AAV-based gene delivery, proceeded to cardiac transplantation and subsequent immunosuppression. hSERCA2a expression was lower in low-dose injection sites. we observed low-level hSERCA2a expression in noninjected regions. the results focus on the high-dose or solvent-injected sites. a group of nonpaced dogs received immunosuppression plus AAV6-hSERCA2a (n=6). a group of nonpaced dogs received immunosuppression plus AAV6-hSERCA2a (n=5). increased LV systolic dimensions (LVESD, 3.20.4 cm; p0.0001), increased LV diastolic dimensions (LVEDD, 4.10.4 cm; p0.001), and decreased percentage fractional area change (%FAC, 235%; p0.001) at baseline. solvent-treated dogs showed ongoing (relative to week 0) cardiac dilation and persistently reduced fractional shortening (6 weeks: LVESD, 3.4 cm; LVEDD vector genomic DNA was detected at between 4103 and 2106 copies of single-stranded DNA per microgram of genomic DNA in high-dose and low-dose injection sites. no obvious differences in DNA copy number were observed between 2 and 12 weeks after injection, although regions receiving low-dose vector tended to show a reduction in AAV copy number. vector DNA was also detected in kidney, liver, and spleen samples. leukocytes were positive for vector within 24 hr of injection. viral genomes were undetectable at all other time points in blood samples. immunosuppression began 4 weeks after viral injection. continued for 8 weeks reduced NAb titers to baseline levels. nonpaced dogs with survival period of 2 and 6 weeks after vector administration. there was no obvious difference in severity of infiltration between dogs that received virus purified by heparin chromatography or CsCl gradient (GLP grade) samples from dogs that received GLP-grade virus (n=8) and solvent controls (n=8) were analyzed in a semiquantitative fashion by a blinded observer. noninjection site of tachycardic-paced dog 6 weeks after receiving AAV6-hSERCA2a. h) High-dose injection site of the same dog in (g) the scale bar is indicated. microscopy of dog hearts recovered 12 weeks after injection of AAV6-hSERCA2a revealed significant CD4+ and CD8+ infiltrating cells in areas adjacent to near-normal cardiomyocytes. there were no significant morphological changes in other organs except for (1) fibrosis of the pleura in lung samples, which was consistent with injury associated with thoracotomy; and (2) increased hepatocyte cytoplasmic clearing in the livers of immunosuppressed dogs hSERCA2a peptide pools elicited detectable levels of IFN- production. planned clinical trial will consider delivery of AAV6-encoding hSERCA2a to patients who receive a ventricular assist device for end-stage heart failure. dogs (n=15) without pacing were used to avoid increased morbidity and risk of mortality anticipated with extended tachycardic pacing. Approximately half of the dogs were immunosuppressed to simulate the clinical scenario in which a VAD-supported patient proceeded to cardiac transplantation. Western blots of cardiac extracts of high-dose sites were analyzed. hSERCA2a expression was lower in low-dose injection sites. human heart (H) and solvent-injected dog heart (C) extracts served as the positive and negative controls. a group of nonpaced dogs received AAV6-hSERCA2a (n=5). dark gray column, 6-week dogs plus AAV6-hSERCA2a (n=6). open column, 12-week normal dogs with immunosuppression plus AAV6-hSERCA2a (n=5). a treatment Dogs (n=14 total) developed increased LV systolic dimensions (LVESD, 3.20.4 cm; p0.0001), increased LV diastolic dimensions (LVEDD, 4.10.4 cm; p0.001), and decreased percentage fractional area change (%FAC, 235%; p0.001) at baseline. solvent-treated dogs showed ongoing (relative to week 0) cardiac dilation and persistently reduced fractional shortening (6 weeks 0.3 427 4.10.4b 3.20.4b 235b 4.20.4b 4.20.4b 3.20.5b 248b 4.00.4b 2.90.4b 288b 3.40.8d 2.41.0d 3113 (n) no statistical analyses were performed on control groups (n=2). b p0.05 compared with prepacing. d p0.05 compared with week 0 (baseline) vector genome DNA was found at a low level (40\u2013500 AAV genomes per microgram of genomic DNA) in noninjected areas of the heart. leukocytes were positive for vector within 24 hr of injection in three of the eight dogs. viral genomes were undetectable at all other time points in blood samples. viral stocks elicited similar NAb titers in heart failure model dogs. however, higher NAb titers developed in nonpaced dogs that received chromatographic purified virus (>1:250) relative to those animals that received vectors prepared by CsCl gradient density centrifugation. immunosuppression commencing 4 weeks after viral injection and continuing for 8 weeks reduced NAb titers to baseline levels. infiltration was also present in 12-week dogs without heart failure that received AAV6-hSERCA2a and immunosuppression compared with those that received virus and no immunosuppression. there was no obvious difference in severity of infiltration between dogs that received virus purified by heparin chromatography or heparin chromatography. e) Noninjection site of a tachycardic-paced control dog 6 weeks after receiving AAV6-hSERCA2a. (h) High-dose injection site of the same dog in (g). the scale bar is indicated. cytotoxic T cell responses to cells expressing human hSERCA2a were cultured with each of 2 pools containing 10 or 11 different peptides. no significant morphological changes in other organs except for fibrosis of the pleura in lung samples, which was consistent with injury associated with thoracotomy. culture medium levels of IFN- were then determined as an assay for cytotoxic T cell activation. none of the hSERCA2a peptide pools elicited detectable levels of IFN- production. a gene therapy-mediated approach has been suggested as a means to improve function of the mammalian heart. AAV6-mediated expression of human SERCA2a in a large animal model of heart failure. results generally follow prior reports in which targeted overexpression of SERCA2a can improve function of the failing mammalian heart. this occurred in both heart failure dogs, in which AAV was injected into the beating hearts, and in nonpaced dogs, which were injected while on cardiopulmonary bypass. these observations resemble our prior studies in baboon, in which cardiac infiltrations and overt myocarditis were observed to accompany a rapid rise and fall in the expression of an AAV2-encoded secreted gene product (TNFRII-Fc-IgG) not all studies that have delivered AAV vectors to large animal striated muscle have detected infiltrative responses. the delivery method, titer of AAV particles, and experimental species may contribute to such differences. inflammatory response to catheter-delivered cardiac AAV infusion is not notable. some studies suggest long-term persistence of AAV-antigens after viral delivery. a large bolus of foreign antigen (i.e., AAV capsid) delivered by localized injection into striated muscle could generate a depot for prolonged cellular immune response to AAV capsids retained at the injection site. a clinical trial using hepatic delivery of AAV2 expressing factor IX (AAV2-hF.IX) observed a transient elevation and subsequent decrease in serum factor IX, accompanied by an increase (and eventual fall) in serum liver enzymes, suggesting cell-mediated destruction of liver cells loaded with AAV antigens. prior studies have demonstrated the usefulness of transient and/or long-term immunosuppression in achieving longer duration, and higher level expression of the AAV-encoded transgene. without immunosuppression, AAV-encoded transgene expression was diminished soon after intramuscular injection because of the T cell responses. hSERCA2a expression can improve cardiac function in a large animal model of heart failure. cellular infiltrates, humoral responses to hSERCA2a, and decrease in hSERCA2a expression can be blunted by immunosuppressive therapy. this may limit efficacy and raise safety issues. human SERCA2a gene was kindly provided by Dr. Roger Hajjar. anti-canine CD4 and anti-canine CD8 were provided by Dr. Peter Moore."}
