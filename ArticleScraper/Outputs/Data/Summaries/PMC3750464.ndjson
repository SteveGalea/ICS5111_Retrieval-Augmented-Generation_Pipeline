{"summary": "the role of autophagy in HRV infection and LGG treatment is unknown. rotavirus gastroenteritis activates autophagy and prevents intestinal damage in infected piglets. autophagy occurs in the intestinal epithelium of neonatal piglets [5], in the intestinal epithelium of neonatal piglets [6], in the ileum of NEC rats [6] multiple autophagy-related proteins control autophagosome formation. it is unclear whether autophagy is a protective response or a deleterious process, but it is clear that uncontrolled autophagy has adverse effects in certain pathological conditions. pigs were assigned to the following treatment groups: LGG plus HRV, HRV only, LGG only (LGG) or mock control. rotavirus infection alone, but not LGG alone, induced autophagy in the intestines of pigs. we immunoblotted for p-mTOR, mTOR, VPS34, Beclin-1 and ATG16L1. LGG inhibits autophagy proteins enhanced by HRV. autophagy proteins in pig ileum treated with LGG and HRV. rotavirus infection induced high levels of lysozyme mRNA. HRV increases the expression of p-mTOR (Ser 2448) in pig ileum. red, p-mTOR, blue, DAPI (20 magnification, scale bar 100 m) LGG increases expression of p53 protein and decreases Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl protein in pig ileum treated with HRV. results were normalized to mock (densitometer value = 1). LGG feeding increased the number of p53-positive intestinal cells in HRV-infected pigs. the localization of cleaved caspase-3 was similar to p53. by H&E staining, we observed vigorous immune infiltration. and discontinued muscularis mucosae in pig ileum infected with HRV. infiltration of immune cells (yellow arrow) and discontinued muscularis mucosae (green arrow) were present in pig ilea infected with HRV (10 magnification, scale bar 200 m) HRV increases claudin-2 protein in pig ileum. we immunoblotted for p-mTOR, mTOR, VPS34, ATG16L1 and Beclin-1 in small intestinal epithelial cells. LGG inhibits autophagy proteins enhanced by HRV in pig ileum. real-time PCR result that rotavirus infection induced high levels of lysozyme mRNA. HRV increases the expression of p-mTOR (Ser 2448) in pig ileum. red, p-mTOR. (C) HRV with/without LGG increases the expression of lysozyme. LGG increases expression of p53 protein and decreases Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl protein in the ilea of HRV-infected pigs. the results were normalized to mock. LGG feeding increased the number of p53-positive intestinal cells in HRV-infected pigs. the localization of cleaved caspase-3 was similar to p53; LGG treatment enhanced the number of cleaved caspase-3-positive cells. this result may explain our observations that non-treated infected piglets were less likely to develop HRV diarrhea. arrows were present in pig ilea infected with HRV (10 magnification, scale bar 200 m) HRV increases claudin-2 protein in pig ileum. LGG inhibits autophagy and increases apoptosis to clear HRV-infected cells. infected pigs reduced expression of p-mTOR, total mTOR, VPS34, and Beclin-1. this suggests that LGG suppressed autophagy at the stage of initiation. recent studies indicate that rotavirus and coronavirus hijack autophagy in the host. a better understanding of the protective role of LGG during viral pathogenesis will lead to novel therapies for infectious diseases. a better understanding of the protective role of LGG during viral pathogenesis will lead to novel therapies for infectious diseases. pigs were thawed, washed 2 times with 0.1% peptone water, centrifuged for 10 min at 4\u00b0C and diluted to specified CFU/ml. all pigs were confirmed as germ-free prior to LGG feeding and sera negative for rotavirus antibodies prior to HRV exposure. pigs in non-HRV groups were orally inoculated with an equal volume of Diluent #5. pigs were given 8 ml of 100 mM sodium bicarbonate 20 min before HRV inoculation. Western blot analysis and antibodies Autophagy and apoptosis-related proteins were detected by western blot of pig ileum sections and ileal epithelial cells. epithelial cells were collected by cutting or scraping, as previously described. protein bands of interest were quantitated densitometrically and normalized to -actin. the animal experiments in this study were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. pigs were thawed, washed 2 times with 0.1% peptone water, centrifuged for 10 min at 4\u00b0C and diluted to specified CFU/ml. all pigs were confirmed as germ-free prior to LGG feeding and sera negative for rotavirus antibodies prior to HRV exposure. pigs in non-HRV groups were orally inoculated with an equal volume of Diluent #5. pigs were given 8 ml of 100 mM sodium bicarbonate 20 min before HRV inoculation to reduce gastric acidity.
