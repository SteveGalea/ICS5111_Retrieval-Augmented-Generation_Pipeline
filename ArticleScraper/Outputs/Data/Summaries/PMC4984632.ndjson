{"summary": "NS1 protein binds a cellular 30-kDa subunit of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF30), which is an essential component for 3\u2032-end cleavage and polyadenylation of host pre-mRNAs. binding of NS1 to CPSF30 is not conserved among all influenza virus strains (3). PA-X is composed of the PA N-terminal domain (amino acids 1 to 191) fused to a unique C-terminal region. most influenza A virus strains possess PA-X proteins with 252 amino acids and a unique C-terminal 61 amino acids. host antiviral innate response both in vitro and in vivo. host adaptive immune response may vary between nonpathogenic and highly pathogenic viruses. both proteins possess a common endonuclease active domain. PA-X localizes in both cytoplasm and nucleus. pCAGGS-Luc, pCAGGS-CalNS1flag, pCAGGS-WSNPA-Xflag, pCAGGS-CalPA-XK134Aflag, and pCAGGS-CalPA-XK134A/c0flag were constructed previously (10, 14) for the construction of pCAGGS-CalPA-X252aaflag and pCAGGS-CalPA-XK134A/c0 related K134A mutants were amplified by PCR using pCAGGS-CalPA-XWTflag or pCAGGS-CalPA-XK134Aflag as the template. the resultant PCR products were subcloned into pcDNA 3.1(). the forward primer encodes simian virus 40 (SV40) tag nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequences. pCAGGS-T7-CalPA-Xc34flag and pCAGGS-T7-CalPA-XWTflag were amplified by PCR using pCAGGS-CalPA-XWTflag as a template. the forward primer encodes the promoter sequence of T7 polymerase (TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG) followed by the first 20 nucleotides of PA-X coding sequences. pCAGGS-T7-CalPA-X6Eflag and pCAGGS-T7-CalPA-X6Eflag were rescued using the 12-plasmid rescue system (24). 293T and MDCK cocultures in a 6-well plate were transfected with 0.1 g each pPol-I plasmid carrying the 8 segments from Cal together with 0.4 g of each pCAGGS plasmid carrying the Cal PA, 293T cells in 12-well plates were transfected with pCAGGS for 24 h. the cells were lysed with the passive lysis buffer included in the kit. the cells were collected and fractionated into nuclear and cytoplasmic materials using a nuclear/cytosol fractionation kit. 293T cells in 12-well plates were transfected with pCAGGS containing the indicated genes together with pCAGGS-Luc for 24 h. the extracted total, cytoplasmic, or nuclear RNA was subjected to Northern blot analysis using a DIG (digoxigenin) northern starter kit (Roche) total cell lysate was separated by SDS-PAGE (4 to 12% gel [Life Technologies] or 12% gel [Bio-Rad]) the proteins were then transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) the membrane was blocked in 2% dry milk and incubated with primary antibodies. horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:10,000; Bio-Rad), or HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:5,000; Bio-Rad) target proteins were visualized using the ChemDoc XRS system (Bio-Rad), and band intensities were quantified using Quantity One 1-D analysis software (Bio-Rad). pCAGGS-Luc, pCAGGS-CalNS1flag, pCAGGS-WSNPA-Xflag, pCAGGS-CalPA-XWTflag, and pCAGGS-CalPA-XK134A/c0flag were constructed previously (10, 14) for the construction of pCAGGS-CalPA-X252aaflag and pCAGGS-CalPA-Xc9flag, CalPA pCAGGS expressing CalPA-XNLS/WTflag, CalPA-XNLS/c0flag, and the related K134A mutants were amplified by PCR using pCAGGS-CalPA-XWTflag or pCAGGS-CalPA-XK134Aflag as the template. the forward primer encodes simian virus 40 (SV40) tag nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequences (CCAAAAAA polymerase (TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG) followed by the first 20 nucleotides of PA-X coding sequences. the coding regions of all constructed plasmids were sequenced. all primer sequences for plasmid constructions are available upon request. 293T and MDCK cocultures in a 6-well plate were transfected with 0.1 g each pPol-I plasmid carrying the 8 segments from Cal together with 0.4 g of each pCAGGS plasmid carrying the Cal PA, PB1, PB2 or NP gene. to rescue CalPA-X-c9 or CalPA-X-c15, we used pPol-I-CalPA-T603A or pPol-I 293T cells in 12-well plates were transfected with pCAGGS-Luc for 24 h. for detection of luciferase mRNA, the cells were collected and fractionated into nuclear and cytoplasmic materials. RNAsecure reagent (Life Technologies) was added to cytoplasmic and nuclear extraction buffer to protect RNAs from RNase. the extracted total, cytoplasmic, or nuclear RNA was subjected to Northern blot analysis using a DIG (digoxigenin) northern starter kit (Roche) to detect luciferase mRNA. the antisense luciferase RNA probe, corresponding to nucleotides 736 to 1370, was synthesized by in vitro transcription using the DIG Northern starter kit. the total, cytoplasmic, or nuclear cell lysate was separated by SDS-PAGE (4 to 12% gel [Life Technologies] or 12% gel [Bio-Rad]) the proteins were then transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) the membrane was blocked in 2% dry milk. 293T cells in 12-well plates were transfected with 2 g of the indicated mRNAs for 24 h. after 1 h posttransfection, the cells were left untreated (dimethyl sulfoxide) or were treated with 4 g/ml actinomycin D (ActD; Sigma) for 8.5 h. NS1 possesses the five amino acids (103F, 106M, 108K, 125D, and 189D) known to be involved in CPSF30 binding. we also constructed a Cal NS1 mutant plasmid (Cal NS1 3mut) to express the NS1 capable of binding CPSF30 (8). expression efficiently, were barely detectable due to strong suppression of its own expression. these data clearly indicate that PA-X proteins have an enhanced capacity for host shutoff activity compared to NS1 proteins. PA-X-252aa shut off luciferase expression as efficiently as CalPA-X-WT. mutation at the endonuclease active site eliminated shutoff activity. luciferase expression suggests that PA-X degrades mRNAs. CalPA-X-c15, CalPA-X-c22, or CalPA-XWT strongly reduced luciferase mRNA levels by over 80% compared to that of the vector control. the first 15 amino acids in the PA-X C-terminal region are sufficient to induce host mRNA degradation and shutoff. the total RNA was extracted from the cell lysate and subjected to blot analysis. 18S rRNAs and 28S rRNAs stained with ethidium bromide are shown as a loading control. the intensities of luciferase mRNA in each sample were normalized by the intensities of 28S rRNA. the relative level of vector control was set to 100%. 293T cells were transfected with the indicated genes in pCAGGS. expression of PA-X protein was detected using anti-PA-X antibody. expression of lamin A/C and tubulin was detected as a nuclear (N) and cytoplasmic (C) marker. istent with the luciferase level, expression of CalPA-X-NLS/c0 was lower than that of CalPA-X-c0 due to higher shutoff activity. the addition of NLS to CalPA-X-WT or CalPA-X-c9 did not further enhance shutoff activities. the results indicate that nuclear localization of PA-X contributes to efficient shutoff activity of the protein. expression of Cal PA-X without the entire C-terminal region (CalPA-X-c0) partially reduced the mRNA level in the cytoplasm but not that in the nucleus. this is consistent with the result of localization in the cytoplasm. luciferase mRNAs were encoding luciferase, eGFP, Cal PA-X, and its variants. compared to eGFP, expression of Cal PA-X significantly reduced luciferase expression from cDNA. deletion of 26 amino acid residues did not affect shutoff activity in both the luciferase plasmid and mRNA-transfected cells. 293T cells transfected with pCAGGS-Luc (A) or luciferase mRNA (B) together with indicated PA-X mRNAs for 24 h are shown. expression of PA-X, eGFP, or tubulin was determined by Western blotting. residues 192 to 200 are sufficient for nuclear localization of PA-X. in cells transfected with luciferase cDNAs, CalPA-X-3E-1 showed only a 16.8-fold reduction in luciferase expression, in contrast to CalPA-X-WT, causing a 357-fold reduction. replacement of all 6 basic amino acids with E almost completely abolished shutoff activity. residues 195K/198K/199R play a critical role in targeting and degrading mRNA in both the cyto the same mutants without the K134A mutation mainly localized in the cytoplasm. these results suggest that residues 195K/198K/199R are key residues for nuclear localization of PA-X. the replacement of basic amino acids with acidic acids may have interfered with the NLS in residues 192 to 200 of the PA-X C-terminal region. expression of PA-X, eGFP, or tubulin was determined by Western blotting as described for Fig. 1B. expression of PA-X, eGFP, or tubulin was determined by Western blotting as described for Fig. 3. expression of PA-X, eGFP, or tubulin was determined by Western blotting. 293T cells were transfected with the indicated mRNAs for 24 h. the extracted total RNA was subjected to Northern blot analysis. the intensities of actin mRNA in each sample were normalized by the intensities of 18S rRNA. mutant viruses whose PA-X proteins possess C-terminal domains composed of either 9 (CalPA-X-c9) or 15 amino acids (CalPA-X-c15) analyzed actin mRNA levels in infected cells and compared these data with the results for Cal WT or Cal PA-XFS. all of the viruses expressed HA, M1, and NS1 proteins at similar levels. 293T cells were cotransfected with a pCAGGS plasmid encoding luciferase (pCAGGS-Luc) the effect of the PA-X and NS1 on luciferase production was determined. NS1 reduced the expression at an intermediate level between Cal NS1 and Aichi NS1 (5.7-fold reduction) PA-X proteins have an enhanced capacity for host shutoff activity compared to NS1 proteins. the results are shown as means plus the standard deviations (n = 3). the first 15 amino acids in the PA-X C-terminal region contribute to suppression of luciferase expression and degradation of mRNA. mutation at the endonuclease active site (K134A) eliminated shutoff activity, suggesting that PA-X degrades mRNAs (14). expression of CalPA-X-c15, CalPA-X-c22, or CalPA-Xc-34 strongly suppressed coexpressed luciferase at a level similar to that of CalPA-X-WT. CalPA-X-c15, CalPA-X-c22, or CalPA-XWT strongly reduced luciferase mRNA levels by over 80% compared to that of the vector control. the first 15 amino acids in the PA-X C-terminal region are sufficient to induce host mRNA degradation and shutoff. total RNA was extracted from the cell lysate and subjected to Northern blot analysis using a DIG-labeled antisense luciferase RNA probe. the intensities of luciferase mRNA in each sample were normalized by the intensities of 28S rRNA. the relative level of vector control was set to 100%. 293T cells were transfected with the indicated genes in pCAGGS. expression of PA-X protein was detected using anti-PA-X antibody. expression of lamin A/C and tubulin was detected as a nuclear (N) marker. the addition of NLS to CalPA-X-WT or CalPA-X-c9 did not further enhance shutoff activities. the results indicate that nuclear localization of PA-X contributes to efficient shutoff activity of the protein. the results are representative of two independent experiments. without the entire C-terminal region (CalPA-X-c0) partially reduced the mRNA level in the cytoplasm but not that in the nucleus. introduction of an NLS to CalPA-X-c0 (PA-X-NLS-c0) enhanced mRNA degradation in the nucleus. luciferase, eGFP, Cal PA-X localizes mainly in the cytoplasm. we transfected cells with mRNAs encoding luciferase, eGFP, or eGFP. expression of Cal PA-X significantly reduced luciferase expression from cDNA. mRNA (B) together with indicated PA-X mRNAs for 24 h is shown. expression of PA-X, eGFP, or tubulin was determined by Western blotting. six basic amino acids in the PA-X C-terminal region play a key role in nuclear localization and host shutoff. in cells transfected with luciferase cDNAs, CalPA-X-3E-1 showed only a 16.8-fold reduction in luciferase expression, in contrast to CalPA-X-WT, causing a 357-fold reduction. replacement of all 6 basic amino acids with E almost completely abolished shutoff activity. residues 195K/198K/199R play a critical role in targeting and degrading mRNA in both the cyto residues 195K/198K/199R are key residues for nuclear localization of PA-X. unexpectedly, CalPA-X-3E-2 mainly localized in the cytoplasm. replacement of basic amino acids with acidic acids may have interfered with the NLS in residues 192 to 200 of the PA-X C-terminal region. expression of PA-X, eGFP, or tubulin was determined by Western blotting as described for Fig. 2B. expression of PA-X, eGFP, or tubulin was determined by Western blotting as described for Fig. 3. expression of PA-X, eGFP, or tubulin was determined by Western blotting. 293T cells were transfected with the indicated mRNAs for 24 h. the extracted total RNA was subjected to Northern blot analysis. the intensities of actin mRNA in each sample were normalized by the intensities of 18S rRNA. the first 15 amino acids in the PA-X C-terminal region contribute to host mRNA degradation and suppression of host protein synthesis. the first 15 amino acids in the PA-X C-terminal region play a key role in host mRNA degradation in the context of viral infection. sarcoma-associated herpesvirus SOX localizes in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, while it targets and degrades mRNAs only in the cytoplasm. nsp1 localizes exclusively in the cytoplasm, where it binds the 40S ribosome and induces mRNA cleavage and inhibition of translation. a previous report suggested a role of the C-terminal 20 residues in the nuclease activity as determined biochemically in vitro using purified proteins. however, the difference was minimal (50%) compared to our results showing an over 100-fold difference in shutoff activity between the constructs lacking the entire C-terminal domain and that containing the first (N-terminal) 15 residues. the essential 6 basic amino acids in the PA-X C-terminal region play a key role in mRNA decay and shutoff. the fact that these basic amino acids are highly conserved among all influenza A strains suggests their essential function in host mRNA decay. PA-X and NS1 have been identified to contribute to the host shutoff activity of influenza A viruses. NS1 and NS1 have been identified to contribute to the host shutoff activity of influenza A viruses."}
