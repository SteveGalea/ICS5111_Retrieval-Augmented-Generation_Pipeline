{"summary": "immunodominant epitopes elicit high-magnitude CTL responses. subdominant determinants generate responses that are relatively lower in magnitude and often less efficacious. selective pressure results in mutations in immunodominant CTL determinants that abrogate recognition. modulating the immunogenicity of subdominant CTL determinants could lead to the development of more efficacious vaccines. the most common approaches involve generating a series of conserved and non-conserved mutations at MHC anchor residues, followed by an empiric determination of whether each individual substitution augments T cell effector function. the immunodominant H-2Db-restricted CTL epitope (S510, CSLWNGPHL, spanning residues 510\u2013518 of the Spike (S) glycoprotein) elicits a high-magnitude, high-avidity CTL response that drives virus diversification during persistent infection [18]\u2013[22]. a second subdominant CTL epitope, S598 (H-2Kb-restricted, RCQ immunogenic S598 epitope was introduced into a recombinant version of JHMV. the modified peptide showed that these high-avidity S598-specific CTLs protected against escape variants in the immunodominant S510 epitope. this showed that these high-avidity S598-specific CTLs protected against escape variants in the immunodominant S510 epitope. recombinant viruses encoding this substitution replicated as efficiently as wild type JHMV (rJ) in vitro. the immunogenicity of S598Q600Y was assessed by intracellular expression of IFN- by central nervous system (CNS)-derived lymphocytes. TCEP enhanced the stimulatory capacity of the S598 peptides. recombinant wild type JHMV (rJ), recombinant JHMV encoding the Q600Y substitution (rJ.SQ600Y) and recombinant JHMV encoding the S598Q600Y substitution. 17Cl-1 cells were infected with rJ or rJ.SQ600Y at a multiplicity of infection. numbers represent frequency of epitope-specific CD8 T cells among total CD8 T cells recovered from the brains of rJ and rJ.SQ600Y-infected mice 7 days p.i. the S598Q600Y epitope elicited a CTL response in the CNS of rJ.SQ600Y infected mice, with nearly 30% of all CD8 T cells recognizing the determinant. five week old mice were infected with rJ or rJ.SQ600Y variant virus. CNS-derived mononuclear cells were harvested and cell aliquots were stimulated ex vivo. data are normalized to the frequency of determinant-specific cells detected using 1 M of peptide. peptide required to elicit a half-maximal response during ex vivo cell stimulation. survival analysis of suckling mice infected with rJ, rJ.SW513R or rJ.SW513R+Q600Y variant viruses. one-third of pups in an individual litter were infected with each virus. rJ, rJ.SQ600Y, rJ.SW513R or rJ.SW513R+Q600Y viruses titers in the brains of maternal antibody-protected suckling mice. one-fourth of pups in an individual litter were infected with each virus. alanine scanning mutagenesis of the two determinants revealed that the CTL response to each cognate peptide following infection was also subtly different reflecting the altered repertoire. if CTL recognizing S598Q600Y exhibit high functional avidity in vivo, they should protect from CTL escape in S510. rJ or rJ.SQ600Y viruses monitored persistently infected mice for the development of clinical signs for 60 days post infection (p.i.) the presence of the highly immunogenic S598Q600Y epitope did not protect mice from acute encephalitis. however, there was a significant reduction in the incidence of clinical disease as well as in the development of CTL escape in S510. c 2 = 32, P0.0001 for rJ versus rJ.SQ600Y. recombinant virus encoding S598Q600Y predicted to be directed at S598Q600Y in mice infected with this virus. 93.3% of mice infected with rJ survived acute infection. replication was suppressed in mice infected with virus encoding the S598Q600Y epitope. in mice infected with rJ.SW513R+Q600Y, virus titers were intermediate between rJ and rJ.SW513R. thus, the presence of the heteroclitic S598Q600Y determinant contributed to suppression of virus replication and to increased survival. b 2 = 1.50, P = 0.221 for epitope S510 CTL escape in rJ versus rJ.SW513R+Q600Y. c 2 = 8.57. P = 0.0034 for epitope S510 CTL escape in rJ versus rJ.SW513R+Q600Y. fewer S598-specific CTL in the CNS of mice receiving BMDC pulsed with S598Q600Y-coated BMDC vaccinees were detected. the determinant showed similar enhancement in function compared to S598-primed cells, whether measured in vitro or in vivo. one-half of the brain was homogenized and clarified for viral titer determination (B) while the other half was used to determine the numbers of S598-specific CTL (C) the relative efficacy of S598-specific CTL (D) was derived by calculating the product of virus titers and absolute numbers of S598-specific CTL (C) side chains of Arg-1, Ile-4 and Asn-7 extend prominently out of the cleft. ala-6 is also largely solvent exposed with its side chain pointing towards the 2 helix. the side chains of Cys (Aba)-2, Gln-3, Phe-5 and Ile-8 are buried. the structure of H-2Kb/S598Q600Y consists of four heterodimers in the asymmetric unit (rmsd of 0.09 for heavy chain (HC) C's), the four copies of the peptide adopt virtually identical conformations. the tyrosine's hydroxyl group forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Glu-152. the side chain of Tyr-3 also forms a number of close contacts with the residues in its immediate environment. deviations of potential significance (>0.5) are observed in the peptide structures that are attributable to the Q660Y mutation are observed at Ile-4 and Phe-5. significant deviations are observed between the two structures at a number of positions in the region of the antigen binding cleft. changes in the conformation of Ser-99, Gln-114, and Gly-151-Glu-154 in the Q600Y complex structure are consistent with the loss of hydrogen bonding interactions with position 3. tic variant of the S598 epitope displays relatively small changes in conformation. the combination of these subtle changes in the TcR accessible residues and the structural landscape of the MHCp lead to more efficacious CTL responses. a heteroclitic virus induced protective T cell responses with a heteroclitic virus. recombinant viruses encoding this substitution replicated as efficiently as wild type JHMV (rJ) in vitro. immunogenicity of S598Q600Y was assessed by intracellular expression of IFN- by central nervous system (CNS)-derived lymphocytes. TCEP enhanced the stimulatory capacity of the S598 peptides. recombinant wild type JHMV (rJ), recombinant JHMV encoding the Q600Y substitution (rJ.SQ600Y) and recombinant JHMV encoding the S598Q600Y substitution (rJ.SQ600Y) 17Cl-1 cells were infected with rJ or rJ.SQ600Y at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1.0. e-specific CD8 T cells recovered from the brains of rJ and rJ.SQ600Y-infected mice 7 days p.i. the S598Q600Y epitope elicited a CTL response in the CNS of rJ and rJ.SQ600Y-infected mice. nearly 30% of all CD8 T cells recognize the determinant. elicits a CTL response with higher functional avidity than wild type S598, protects from clinical disease in the context of an S510 CTL escape mutation. five week old B6 mice were infected with rJ or rJ.SQ600Y variant virus. one-half of each litter was infected with rJ while the other half was infected with rJ.SQ600Y. data represent results from 10 litters derived from multiple independent JHMV-immune dams. numbers in parentheses indicate the number of pups infected with each virus. rJ, rJ.SQ600Y, rJ.SW513R or rJ.SW513R+Q600Y viruses titers in the brains of maternal antibody-protected suckling mice 5 or 6 days after infection. one-fourth of pups in an individual litter were infected with each virus. total and cross-reacting cell populations from rJ.SQ600Y-infected mice were compared. alanine scanning mutagenesis revealed that the CTL response to each cognate peptide following infection was also subtly different reflecting the altered repertoire. if CTL recognizing S598Q600Y exhibit high functional avidity in vivo, they should protect from CTL escape in S510. S598Q600Y-specific CTL are present in higher numbers and exhibit higher functional avidity than the native S598-specific response. however, there was a significant reduction in the incidence of clinical disease as well as in the development of CTL escape in S510. recombinant virus encoding S598Q600Y may reflect enhanced suppression of virus replication mediated by co-dominant CTL responses directed against S510 and S598Q600Y. the mutation occurs in 13% of all CTL escape variants [19],[20],[22],[29],[30], and completely abrogates native S510 CTL recognition [31]. the presence of the heteroclitic S598Q600Y determinant contributed to suppression of virus replication and to increased survival. this result was unexpected, as the majority of CTL in the rJ.SW513R+Q600Y-infected CNS specifically target the S598Q600Y determinant. 0.0034 for epitope S510 CTL escape in rJ versus rJ.SW513R+Q600Y. we vaccinated mice with bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDC) alone. mice were challenged via intranasal inoculation of 4104 PFU of wild type, non-recombinant JHMV. S598-specific CTL induced by the S598Q600Y determinant show similar enhancement in function compared to S598-primed cells. groups of 4-week-old B6 mice were vaccinated with bone marrow-derived DC pulsed with peptides corresponding to S598Q600Y, native S598 or no peptide. data in B\u2013D represent results from six individual mice analyzed in two independent experiments. structures of the wild-type and engineered S598 H2Kb complexes were determined to 1.8 and 2.8 resolution respectively. the cysteine analogue's side chain is not involved in hydrophilic interactions. there are suitably positioned hydrogen bonding partners. the original thiol side chain could potentially interact. Gln-3 forms hydrogen bonds with the Ser-99 and Gln-114 of the HC. tyrosine's hydroxyl group forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Glu-152. side chains of Phe-5 and Ile-8 are buried within hydrophobic pockets. a pocket is observed between the -2 helix and the peptide near position 3 in the index structure that is filled by the steric bulk of Tyr-3 in the Q600Y structure. this increase in surface complementarity and the greater number of observed interactions resulting from the Q3Y3 mutation would account for the enhanced thermostability (10\u00b0C) measured for the H-2Kb/S598Q600Y\u2013Aba complex. peptides similar to S598 superimpose well with an rmsd of 0.37 for C atoms (residues 1\u2013176) significant deviations are observed between the two structures at a number of positions in the region of the antigen binding cleft. S598Q600Y elicited a response with higher functional avidity to both the cognate and native determinants than S598, and this was not reflected in differential V usage. the response to S598 and S598Q600Y in rJ was similarly diverse. a peptide with low MHC class I binding also elicits a low avidity T cell response. the biological significance of the heteroclitic Q600Y determinant was shown by its ability to protect JHMV-infected mice from CTL escape at S510. in mice infected with wild type JHMV, the immune response is functionally focused on a single CD8 T cell determinant. the Q600Y substitution effectively prevents CTL escape at either S510 or S598Q600Y by the induction of a second high avidity CTL response. the combination of induction of high avidity CTL and inability to tolerate mutation without adversely affecting virus fitness make S598Q600Y an ideal target for the anti-JHMV CTL the generation of unique populations of CTL that respond with high functional avidity to weakly immunogenic viral epitopes will be useful for the treatment and prevention of human infectious diseases. our proposed structure-guided approach has direct application to HIV, HCV and other chronic infections in which virus persistence and CTL escape occurs. mice analyzed for expression of IFN- by intracellular cytokine staining protocol. peptides corresponding to epitopes were used at a final concentration of 1 M. cells were stimulated in the presence of 500 M TCEP. at least two independent isolates of each recombinant virus were analyzed. one-step viral growth kinetics Virus was inoculated onto confluent 17Cl-1 monolayers in a 12-well plate. total virus (cell-associated and cell-free) was titered as previously described. cell aliquots were subsequently stained for CD8 (PE-Cy7-anti-CD8) and V (FITC-anti-V2, 3, 4, 5.1/5.2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10b, 11, 12, 13 or 14, BD-Pharmingen) after 5.5 hours, cells were stained for intracellular IFN- (PE-anti-IFN-) 5105 LPS-matured DC were left uncoated, coated with S598 or S598Q600Y peptides and injected via tail vein into groups of 4-week-old mice. seven days following DC-vaccination, mice were infected intranasally with 4104 PFU of JHMV. a 2.8 resolution dataset was collected on an in-house source. both structures were solved by molecular replacement in PHASER [54] against previously solved H-2Kb complexes. the results underwent iterative cycles of refinement in PHENIX [55] and REFMAC5 [56] followed by model building/correction in COOT [57] peptides corresponding to epitopes were used at a final concentration of 1 M. cells were stimulated in the presence of 500 M TCEP. all antibodies and reagents were purchased from BD Pharmingen. at least two independent isolates of each recombinant virus were analyzed. one-step viral growth kinetics Virus was inoculated onto confluent 17Cl-1 monolayers in a 12-well plate at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1.0. total virus (cell-associated and cell-free) was titered as previously described. cell aliquots were subsequently stained for CD8 (PE-Cy7-anti-CD8) and V (FITC-anti-V2, 3, 4, 5.1/5.2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10b, 11, 12, 13 or 14, BD-Pharmingen) after 5.5 hours, cells were stained for intracellular IFN- (PE-anti-IFN-) 5105 LPS-matured DC were left uncoated, coated with S598 or S598Q600Y peptides and injected via tail vein into groups of 4-week-old mice. mice were infected intranasally with 4104 PFU of JHMV. brains were harvested from mice and frequencies of epitope-specific CD8 T cells were determined by ex vivo stimulation. the WT data were integrated in MOSFLM [52] and scaled/merged using SCALA [53]. both structures were solved by molecular replacement in PHASER [54] against previously solved H-2Kb complexes. resultant models underwent iterative cycles of refinement in PHENIX [55] and REFMAC5 [56] followed by model building/correction in COOT [57]. total mononuclear cells were harvested from mice infected with rJ or rJ.SQ600Y and stimulated ex vivo with peptides corresponding to native S598 or S598Q600Y epitopes. after stimulation, cells were surface stained for CD8 and the indicated V chain followed by intracellular cytokine staining for IFN-. the differential responses to RCAIFANI in panels C and D reflect the differing amounts of peptide used in the two assays. the peptide is in stick format with carbon atoms coloured yellow."}
