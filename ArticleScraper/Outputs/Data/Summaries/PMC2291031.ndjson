{"summary": "a comparative observer-blind, randomised, controlled clinical trial (n = 600) was performed to assess safety and immunogenicity versus a non-adjuvanted subunit influenza vaccine (Sub/MF59TM; FLUAD\u00ae, Novartis Vaccines) subjects were randomised (2:1) to receive Sub/MF59TM or Subunit. MF59TM-adjuvanted subunit influenza vaccine is well tolerated by elderly Chinese subjects. it induces a higher level of immunogenicity than a non-adjuvanted subunit influenza vaccine in this population that is at high risk of influenza-related complications. the elderly are at increased risk of influenza and its related complications. influenza vaccines confer protection against laboratory-confirmed influenza in 70\u201390% of young adults (18\u201364 years of age) these vaccines are less effective (17\u201353%) in the elderly, due in part to the elderly's waning immunity. racial differences in relation to vaccination have been observed in Taiwan among Han Chinese children compared with Aboriginal children. the adjuvant MF59TM [23] to subunit influenza vaccine has been shown to enhance the immune response and offer increased clinical protection in elderly subjects. enhanced immunogenicity is observed in elderly subjects with underlying chronic conditions, who are at especially high risk of influenza and its complications. safety evaluation was completed for 589 subjects and serological analysis was performed for 554 subjects. major reasons for patient withdrawal were refusal to continue the study. no subjects were withdrawn because of an AE due to the study vaccines. a vaccine-related SAE (high fever) was reported for one subject (0.3%) in the Sub/MF59TM group. however, a vaccine-related SAE (high fever) was reported for one subject (0.3%) in the Sub/MF59TM group. incidence of adverse events (AEs), adverse reactions and serious AEs (SAEs) for the two vaccine groups. 0.0(0) 1.0(2) Irritability 0.0(0) 0.5(1) *P 0.005 versus the Subunit group Sub/MF59TM, MF59TM-adjuvanted subunit influenza vaccine Immunogenicity Pre-vaccination GMTs were similar for both vaccine groups against all three influenza strains tested. in the Sub/MF59TM group, post-vaccination GMTs against all three strains were significantly higher compared with the Subunit group. however, in the sub/MF59TM group, post-vaccination GMTs against all three strains were significantly higher compared with the Subunit group. the percentage of subjects seroprotected against the A/H3N2 strain was significantly greater after vaccination with Sub/MF59TM compared with Subunit vaccination. strains were higher in the Sub/MF59TM group, no significant difference was found between vaccine groups. a significantly greater number of previously unprotected elderly subjects showed seroconversion against the A/H3N2 strain. induration at the injection site was significantly (P 0.05) more frequent in the Sub/MF59TM group compared with the Subunit group (24.0% versus 15.2%, respectively) pain at the injection site and fever (axillary temperature >38\u00b0C) were significantly (P 0.005) more frequent in the Sub/MF59TM group compared with the Subunit group (0.3%). incidence of local and systemic reactions reported for the two vaccine groups Sub/MF59TM %(n) Subunit %(n) Local reaction Rash 0.0(0) 0.5(1) Erythema 1.5(6) 1.5(3) Induration 0.5(2) 2.5(5)* Swelling 2.8(11) 1.0(2) Pain 10.2(40)** 3.0(6) Pruritus 1.3(5) 3.0(6) Systemic reaction Headache 3.6(14) 2.5(5) Fever 15.9(62)** 7.6 in the Sub/MF59TM group, post-vaccination GMTs against all three strains were significantly higher compared with the Subunit group. however, post-vaccination GMTs against all three strains were significantly higher compared with the Subunit group. higher post-vaccination GMTs were reported in the Sub/MF59TM group compared with the Subunit group for the A/H3N2 and B strains. the percentage of subjects seroprotected against the A/H3N2 strain was significantly (P 0.001) greater after vaccination with Sub/MF59TM compared with Subunit vaccination. pre-vaccination serum (i.e. haemagglutinin inhibition [HI] titre 1:10) and post-vaccination HI titre 1:40; bSignificant increase is defined as 4-fold increase from non-negative ( 1:10) pre-vaccination HI titre; cNumber of subjects: Sub/MF59TM, 6; Subunit, 5; Subunit, 152; Subunit, 183 *P 0.001 versus the Subunit group more than 30 million doses of the MF59TM-adjuvanted subunit influenza vaccine have been sold. the MF59TM-adjuvanted subunit influenza vaccine has demonstrated a good safety profile. the immunogenicity results agree with the results of trials conducted in Europe. influenza A strains are often the most dominant and the most relevant strains among adults and the elderly. levels of HI antibody titres correlate with seroprotection against influenza. MF59TM-adjuvanted vaccine may also offer greater clinical protection in elderly Chinese subjects. subjects randomlyised to receive either Sub/MF59TM (n = 400) or a non-adjuvanted subunit influenza vaccine (subunit; Agrippal\u00ae, Novartis Vaccines; n = 200) both vaccines included the strains recommended for the 2005\u20132006 Northern hemisphere influenza season. blood samples were taken from all subjects pre-vaccination (Day 1) and post-vaccination (Day 22) haemagglutinin inhibition (HI) antibody titres were measured in all samples. the geometric mean titre ratio (GMR) of post-vaccination titres was also reported. study recruited 25 Chinese subjects ( 60 years of age) of these, 24 subjects were administered Sub/MF59TM in follow-up sequence. subjects were randomised (2:1) to receive either Sub/MF59TM (n = 400) or a non-adjuvanted subunit influenza vaccine (subunit; Agrippal\u00ae, Novartis Vaccines; n = 200). both the pivotal safety study and the subsequent trial were performed according to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki, Good Clinical Practice, and local laws. the study protocol and informed consent form were approved by local ethics committees; all subjects signed an Informed Consent Form. the geometric mean titre ratio (GMR) of post-vaccination titres versus pre-vaccination titres was also reported. the number of subjects with seroprotective HI antibody titres ( 1:40) was also evaluated pre-vaccination and post-vaccination. for each influenza strain, the number of subjects with seroprotective HI antibody titres ( 1:40) was also evaluated pre-vaccination and post-vaccination (Day 1 and Day 22) and the number of subjects achieving seroconversion (defined as 4-fold increase in HI titre from non-negative pre-vaccination titre [ 1:10] to a post-vaccination HI titre 1:40) post-vaccination (Day 22) was calculated."}
