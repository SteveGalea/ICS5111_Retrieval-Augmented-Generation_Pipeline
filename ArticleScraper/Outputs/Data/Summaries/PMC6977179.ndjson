{"summary": "the total number of mortalities due to MERS is already greater than that due to severe acute respiratory syndrome. human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 was found to be the cellular receptor for MERS-CoV. other betacoronaviruses in bats from subgenus Merbecovirus have suggested that these animals are probably the reservoir for MERS-CoV (3\u20135) a recent study revealed that direct inoculation of Bactrian camels intranasally with MERS-CoV can lead to infection with abundant virus shedding and seroconversion. a total of 29 and 11 serum samples were collected from 29 Bactrian camels and 11 hybrid camels from a private collection in Xinjiang, china. the cutoff of the ELISA was defined as three standard deviations above the mean absorbance value of 10 dromedary serum samples that tested negative with the neutralization antibody test. the neutralization antibody test was performed by incubating serially diluted camel sera with 100 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) MERS-CoV for 2 hours before infecting the Vero cells for 1 hour. the cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed for 5 days, and the antibody test, 6 (55%) and 9 (82%), respectively, were positive for MERS-CoV antibodies. all 92 Bactrian camel serum samples from Xinjiang were negative for MERS-CoV antibodies tested with both S-ELISA and the neutralization antibody test. neutralization antibody test, ELISA, immunofluorescence assay, plaque reduction neutralization test, and/or protein microarray, had MERS-CoV antibodies (10\u201314) however, the sera from all these studies were obtained from Bactrian camels in geographical regions where there were no dromedaries that were positive for MERS-CoV or its antibodies. several clades of MERS-CoV are circulating in dromedaries. this suggests that interspecies jumping from bats to camels may not be a very recent event. a number of MERS-CoV vaccines have been developed for their potential use in dromedaries."}
