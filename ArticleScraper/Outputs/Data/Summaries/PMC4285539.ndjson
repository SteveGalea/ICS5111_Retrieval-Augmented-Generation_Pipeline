RT-PCR and qPCR Total RNA was extracted using an RNeasy Mini kit. PCR products were separated by 1.2% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. a melting point analysis was accomplished after the last cycle by cooling the samples to 55\u00b0C and then increasing the temperature to 95\u00b0C at a speed of 0.2\u00b0C/s. each sample was run in triplicate. EMSA was performed using the NF-B EMSA Kit according to manufacturer's instructions. nuclear extracts (15 g) were incubated with biotin-labeled oligonucleotide probe in binding buffer for 20 min. a fluorescent analysis was conducted using a fluoView Confocal Microscope. the plates were washed 3 times with PBS. supernatants derived from BMDMs of different groups were prepared. first, the membrane was coated with 10 g/ml collagen IV at 37\u00b0C for 2 h. 105 CXCR3+ T lymphocytes suspended in RPMI 1640 were added to top wells. chambers were then incubated for 180 min in a 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 atmosphere. mice were incubated with recombinant mouse MRP8 protein (1.5 g/ml) after 24 h of incubation, the supernatant was collected and the levels of IP-10 quantified using Luminex. mice were anesthetized with ketamine (50 mg/kg) and xylazine (5 mg/kg) circulating MRP8/MRP14 levels were significantly higher in survivors of blunt trauma vs. nonsurvivors (P 0.001) both groups showed very close clinical and demographic features, including age, degree of infection, and Injury Severity Score values. plasma from survivors and nonsurvivors was sampled at different days. plasma from survivors and nonsurvivors was measured using ELISA kit. correlation between plasma MRP8/MRP14 and IP-10 was analyzed. qPCR was performed to measure IP-10 mRNA expression. THP-1 cells were incubated with 0 to 6 g/ml MRP8/MRP14 for up to 24 h. IP-10 in the cultured supernatants was detected by Luminex. denatured MRP8/MRP14 lost the ability to induce IP-10 expression. LPS is not inactivated at temperatures used to denature MRP8/MRP14. previous studies demonstrated that IFN- is an IP-10 inducer (30\u201334) RP8/MRP14-induced IP-10 production, macrophages from myD88-, TRIF-, and CD14-deficient mice were used. absence of MyD88 had no effect on MRP8/MRP14-induced IP-10 mRNA and protein expression. however, TRIF deficiency markedly prevented IP-10 expression induced by MRP8/MRP14. ##P 0.01 vs. RAGE/ untreated group; ##P 0.01 vs. MyD88/ untreated group. MRP8/MRP14 activates NF-B pathway Bioinformatic analysis. previous studies demonstrated that in the promoter region of the IP-10 gene there are 3 conserved cis elements. THP-1 cells were stimulated with MRP8/MRP14 (1.5 g/ml) for 0, 30, 60, 120, and 240 min. total cellular proteins were extracted for immunoblot analysis. BMDMs from WT, TLR4/, or TRIF/ mice were stimulated with MRP8/MRP14 for 1 h. immunoblot analysis was performed to detect phosphorylated NF-B p65. transcription factor IRF3 is involved in regulation of IFN-stimulated genes. RAW264.7 cells were transfected by electroporation with IRF3 siRNA or nonspecific siRNA (Cont. siRNA) for 36 h. IRF3 was detected by immunoblot analysis. the WT IP-10 promoter-driven luciferase reporter gene was associated with an apparent response in RAW264.7 cells after stimulation with MRP8/MRP14. inhibition of both the NF-B and IRF3 pathways reduced IP-10 promoter activation induced by MRP8/MRP14. pGL-IP10 (B2mut), pGL-IP10 (ISREmut), and pGL-IP10 (B2/ISREmut) cells were treated with MRP8/MRP14 for 6 h, followed by the luciferase activity assay as above. further experiments with mutant IP-10 promoter-driven luciferase reporter gene constructs suggested that the ISRE and B2 in the distal region were necessary for full activation of MRP8/M in vitro chemotaxis assay, MRP8/MRP14 dramatically induced the chemotaxis of CXCR3+ T lymphocytes compared with control. IP-10 neutralizing antibody significantly reduced migration of CXCR3+ T lymphocytes. 88/, or TRIF/ mice with or without stimulation of MRP8/MRP14. an IP-10 neutralizing Ab was injected as indicated to clarify the pivotal role of IP-10 in vivo. each assay was done in triplicate; data represent mean sd from 3 independent experiments. induced inflammation in vivo, mouse model of HS/FF using MRP8 neutralizing antibody or control IgG was performed to highlight the crucial role of MRP8/MRP14. first, MRP8 antibody can reduce IP-10 induction stimulated by recombinant MRP8 protein in RAW264.7 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. plasma samples from human blunt trauma patients were assessed for MRP8/MRP14. circulating MRP8/MRP14 levels were significantly higher in survivors of blunt trauma. monocytes/macrophages were a major source of the inflammatory mediators produced in settings such as trauma/hemorrhage. we screened human THP-1 monocytes/macrophages for expression of a panel of inflammatory mediators in response to MRP8/MRP14. chemokines IP-10/CXCL10 and IL-8 were the predominant inflammatory mediators expressed by THP-1 cells in response to MRP8/MRP14. survivor patients were determined by Luminex.*P 0.001 vs. nonsurvivor group; P 0.01 vs. respective control group. qPCR analysis showed that MRP8/MRP14 induced IP-10 expression in monocytes/macrophages. THP-1 cells were challenged with MRP8/MRP14 or LPS alone, or MRP8/MRP14 or LPS inactivated by 10 g/ml PMB or heated at 80\u00b0C for 30 min. IP-10 levels were determined 24 h after stimulation. there is no significant correlation between MRP8/MRP14-induced IP-10 production and IFN- expression within 24 h. neutralizing antibody against IFN- failed to show effect on IP-10 induction. MRP8/MRP14-induced IP-10 expression is TLR4-TRIF dependent. BMDMs isolated from C57BL/6 (WT), TLR4/, RAGE/, MyD88/, TRIF/, or CD14/ mice were stimulated with or without MRP8/MRP14 (1.5 g/ml) for 6 h. RT-PCR was used to detect IP-10 mRNA expression. RP8/MRP14 for 1 h, both IKK/ and NF-B p65 were significantly phosphorylated, which led to NF-B p65 location into the nuclei of macrophages. experiments with NF-B-specific inhibitors PDTC and Bay11-7082 suggested a key role for NF-B in MRP8/MRP14-induced IP-10 expression. EMSA was performed by incubation of nuclear extracts. THP-1 cells were pretreated with NF-B-specific inhibitors PDTC (50 M) or Bay11-7082 (10 M) for 1 h. immunoblot analysis was performed to detect phosphorylated NF-B p65. 3 as well as its upstream kinases, TBK1 and IKK, were significantly phosphorylated at 30 to 60 min after stimulation with MRP8/MRP14. IRF3 translocated from cytosol to nucleus by approximately 1 h after stimulation of MRP8/MRP14. the requirement of IRF3 for the MRP8/MRP14-induced IP-10 expression was tested using siRNA approaches to knockdown IRF3 (approximately 78%) in RAW264.7 cells. the requirement of IRF3 for the MRP8/MRP14-induced IP-10 expression was tested using siRNA approaches. plasmid expressing Renilla luciferase (pRL-TK) was transfected for 24 h. cells were treated with pRL-TK for 6 h. luciferase activity normalized to Renilla is represented as fold induction over the reporter activity in unstimulated cells. the activity of the IP-10 promoter/reporter construct induced by MRP8/MRP14 was nearly abolished in double mutants of B2 and ISRE. this results indicate that MRP8/MRP14-induced IP-10 transcription requires synergy between NF-B and IRF3 for full activation. gene deficiency significantly blocked chemotaxis of CXCR3+ T lymphocytes. gene knockout failed to show any significant effect on the chemotaxis. migration of CXCR3+ T lymphocytes induced by MRP8/MRP14 is regulated by TLR4-TRIF-IP-10 signaling axis. in vivo, MRP8/MRP14 dramatically induced the chemotaxis of CXCR3+ lymphocytes compared with control at different time points (8, 16, and 24 h) after LPS administration. in vivo, injection of IP-10 neutralizing antibody dramatically reduced the migration of CXCR3+ lymphocytes. NF-B p65 and IRF3 were partially attenuated by administration of neutralizing antibody in AMs. these results suggest the role of MRP8/MRP14-IP-10 signaling in injury-induced inflammation. TRIF promotes the activation of both IKK/-NF-B and TBK1-IKK-IRF3 pathway, initiating the production of IP-10 in monocytes/macrophages. the current study demonstrated that blunt trauma patients produce MRP8/MRP14, and that blunt trauma survivors produce more MRP8/MRP14 than nonsurvivors. previous studies have shown that CXCR3+ T cells can be either proinflammatory or regulatory T cells (40, 44\u201348) this may lead to resolution of inflammation when it stimulates IP-10 levels to an appropriate degree. postinjury release of MRP8/MRP14 below a certain threshold would associate with overly robust production of IP-10. inflammatory responses such as the production of TNF- and IL-6 via the activation of NF-B and mitogen-activated protein kinases. the TRIF-dependent pathway controls the expression of chemokines such as type I IFN and RANTES (56\u201358). a synergistic effect on the induction of IP-10 gene was observed in cells costimulated with both the ISRE and B sites. a possible limitation of our studies is that the MRP8/MRP14 used was expressed using a prokaryotic expression system and purified from Escherichia coli cultures. we elucidate signaling pathways that control IP-10 expression in monocytes/macrophages stimulated by MRP8/MRP14. these findings may provide novel diagnostic or therapeutic strategies in the setting of injury."}
