{"summary": "baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) is powerful for eukaryotic multiprotein complexes with many subunits. baculovirus is prolifically used to accelerate applications in the eukaryotes. the beVS can be conceptualized on 3 levels. DNA elements comprising genes of interest, promoters, terminators, transcriptional enhancers and others are combined with plasmid backbone modules into (multi)gene expression cassettes. transfer plasmids are then integrated into a baculoviral genome by using transposition or recombination methods to yield a composite baculoviral genome containing all heterologous DNA elements. recombinant baculovirus was recombinated by homologous recombination in the insect cell. recombinant baculovirions were released to infect further cells in the culture. this was already a much improved procedure, and in hands of experienced users could be applied relatively straight-forwardly. production of the recombinant virus is cloned into a transfer plasmid. the transfer plasmid is flanked by short DNA sequences representing the right and left arms of the recombinant virus. the resulting recombinant BAC DNA (bacmid) is extracted and can be verified easily by a PCR reaction with appropriate primers. a LoxP site-specific recombination site, inserted at this position, allows to generate composite viral genomes by in vivo Cre-LoxP fusion in E. coli with a customized transfer plasmids containing a conditional replication origin. so-called Acceptor and Donor plasmids contain multiple cloning sites to insert genes of interest by conventional or samless cloning methods of choice. a BAC was constructed carrying a disabling mutation in an essential gene (ORF1692) which impairs virus replication. this detrimental mutation is repaired when the mutant BAC is co-transfected with a transfer plasmid containing the expression cassette and a wild type copy of the mutated gene. this restores replication and eliminates the bacterial replicon in the polyhedrin locus. genes considered detrimental for protein production or stability have been removed following the original polh deletion. v-cath and chiA encode a cathepsin protease and a chitinase respectively. the loci for v-cath and chiA are juxtaposed in the viral genome. synthetic biology approaches are opening up entirely new avenues that may transform recombinant protein production in the future. recombinant proteins expressed by BEVS can range from a few micrograms to hundreds of milligrams per liter, and cannot be predicted. the use of adapted affinity tags is often the only means to obtain pure protein. if a large number of proteins need to be co-expressed, co-expression is a vital prerequisite. co-expression of many gene products from several viruses exploits the capacity of insect cells to be simultaneously infected by multiple viruses. co-infection can work reasonably well for small-scale experiments when a small number (2-3) baculoviruses are added, but scale-up is inefficient and logistically demanding. multigene expression cassettes are then inserted into the multiBac baculoviral genome by Tn7 transposition into a Tn7 attachment site and by site-specific recombination into a LoxP site on the viral backbone. a large and growing set of tools now exist to assemble DNA elements into large functional multigene circuits, including homing endonuclease based fragment assembly. complex assembly and activity of cellular multiprotein complexes critically depends on correct stoichiometry of the subunits present in the complex. a recombinant expression experiment typically aims at substantial overexpression in a heterologous host cell. this challenge often needs to be addressed during expression and during purification by tight control of the proper stoichiometry of the individual subunits. complexlink was successfully applied to produce a synthetic polymerase that could be crystallized unlocking the atomic structure of this complex. many proteins and protein complexes were produced, often for the first time, by BEVS, in the quality and quantity. the baculoviral genome constitutes the second level in this concept. recombinant baculovirus was removed from the viral backbone with very low efficiency. this improved significantly when the polh locus was disrupted, and dramatically when the baculoviral genome was linearized. the advent of powerful genome engineering tools has revolutionized eukaryotic genome engineering with transformative potential. we anticipate that these technologies will be profusely exploited in the near future to extend optimization to the host cell genome.
