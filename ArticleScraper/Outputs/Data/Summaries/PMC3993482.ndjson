{"summary": "deaths due to infections are among the leading 15 causes of death. influenza and pneumonia are ranked 8th and septicemia is ranked 11th as causes of death. autopsy rates have continuously declined since the 1950s. review provides a brief historical perspective of autopsy microbiology. there are no specific guidelines, recommendations, or checklist items that address performance standards for postmortem microbiology culture examinations. final discussion addresses current practices and the pros and cons of performing postmortem microbiology examinations. in only 35% of all cases, results from antemortem and postmortem BCs were in agreement; of the 65% results with disagreement, no results of postmortem BCs were clinically relevant with regard to the cause of death. authors also commented on the financial impact and cost of the autopsy and postmortem microbiologic cultures with respect to the greater fiscal issues in medicine. a few studies demonstrated evidence in support of bacterial transmigration in the form of animal as well as in vitro experiments (26\u201328) the concept of agonal spread has much stronger support in the scientific and medical literature (23\u201331) despite the absence of a significant difference between the 24 h and >24 h postmortem intervals, the authors observed a slight increase in the levels of Enterobacteriaceae recovered in postmortem BCs collected after the initial 24 h postmortem interval. based guidelines do not exist for postmortem culture interpretation. some studies were published that investigated the problems related to contamination of postmortem bacteriologic cultures. a greater level of consensus exists that prompt cooling and limited mobilization of the deceased body decrease the possibility of postmortem spread of microorganisms. 45% of lung and 75% of kidney specimens were negative. the remainder of postmortem culture specimens yielded contaminant organisms more often than significant pathogens. the autopsies were performed within 24 h of death. blood cultures obtained from heart blood, spleen cultures, or peripheral venous sites are commonly applied during postmortem examinations. the isolation of a typical pathogen in a monomicrobial culture is likely to represent a true pathogen. it is of utmost importance to apply a strict sterile technique in both circumstances to avoid contamination of the specimen. the lower respiratory tract is usually a sterile body site; however, bacteria present in upper respiratory tract and bronchial secretions could ultimately multiply in number after death. despite this possibility of postmortem bacterial migration, the lungs should remain (mostly) sterile in the absence of a true infection. the postmortem culture may be invaluable in establishing the diagnosis of an infectious disease as the cause of death (46) in some cases, an infection may be discovered only during the postmortem examination of the organs, e.g., heart valve vegetations in endocarditis. in other cases, postmortem blood and tissue cultures may provide additional information regarding the extent and severity of an already suspected or known antemortem infectious disease process. postmortem cultures are of value in only a limited number of patients. the ability to differentiate between true-positive culture results and postmortem transmigration and/or contamination remains a challenge to microbiologists and pathologists. a thorough clinical-pathological correlation is necessary as part of the interpretation of postmortem bacteriologic cultures. effective communication between pathologist and microbiologist would provide the greatest assurance that specimens would be collected in appropriate cases, without contamination. the engaged microbiologist will ultimately be rewarded for this effort by recognizing that laboratory work and cost will be diminished by avoiding the processing of contaminated and inappropriate postmortem specimens."}
