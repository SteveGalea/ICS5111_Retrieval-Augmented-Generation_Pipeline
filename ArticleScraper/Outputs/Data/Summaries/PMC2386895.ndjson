{"summary": "contact tracing is commonly used to identify individuals that have been in contact with infectious individuals, to reduce the number of potential onward infections from traced individuals. tracing was successful in the 2003 SARS epidemic (Lipsitch et al. 2003), but unsuccessful in the 2001 FMD epidemic in the UK (Ferguson et al. 2001; Keeling et al. 2001; Kao 2003). in more highly structured contact networks, the properties of the network markedly influence the efficacy of contact tracing. for example, contact tracing is more effective on clustered networks than on random networks. on scale-free networks a higher tracing effort is needed to control an epidemic. the efficacy of contact tracing is difficult to determine without exact knowledge of the underlying contact network. each node in the network is classified according to one of four states of disease progression: susceptible nodes (S); nodes at once infected and infectious (I); nodes \u2018triggering\u2019 contact tracing (T), which are identified as being infectious. infectious contacts becoming infected in a small time interval t is p=1exp(kt) disease is detected at an infectious node (e.g. via clinical signs or screening) at rate. this results in the isolation of the node and triggers the tracing of its contacts. eij is the probability that a randomly chosen link connects a node with i connections to a node with j connections where the link under consideration is itself not counted. for disassortatively mixed networks 1r0, for random networks r0 and for assortatively mixed networks 0r1. the network analysis that illustrates the effect of preferential mixing is performed for K=100. k must be sufficiently large to allow for a range of new infections in the first generation well above 1. the networks are generated by only accepting nodes with k3. 2.1 Disease transmission The network-based disease transmission and contact-tracing model is based on models considered by Huerta & Tsimring (2002), Eames & Keeling (2003) and Kiss et al. (2005, 2006a) each node in the network is classified according to one of four states of disease progression: susceptible nodes (S); nodes at once infected and infectious (I); nodes \u2018triggering\u2019 contact tracing (T), which are identified as being infectious the removal of triggering nodes TR triggers the tracing of its contacts. the infectious neighbours of triggering nodes (T) are traced at rate per contact. these are then directly removed and do not initiate further tracing. q k = j k = j k q j q k = j e j k = j e j k = j e j k. q 2 is the variance of the distribution qk for disassortatively mixed networks 1r0 and random networks r0. moreno et al. (2003) proposed a numerical method for epidemic models that can account for connectivity correlations. this method works without explicitly generating the network. but it offers less flexibility when considering disassortatively mixed networks. the size of the GC as a function of the cut-off parameter K. as the cut-off parameter increases, the number of links in the network increases and the network becomes denser. a K-value exists where the GC size is equal on disassortatively mixed networks. assortatively mixed networks have a smaller GC size compared with disassortatively mixed networks. k1.7 supports only a narrow range of epidemiological parameters over which large epidemics can occur. Constant kTp provides a constant number of secondary infections caused by the introduction of infection at a node when the remainder of the network is susceptible. the final epidemic size R() is plotted against the transmission probability for r0.2, 0.1, 0.05, 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.1, 0.2. epidemics on assortatively mixed networks have a faster initial growth rate. this is mainly due to the GC containing a \u2018core\u2019 group of high-degree nodes. differences in the initial epidemic growth rate are directly related to the basic reproduction number R0 (Anderson & May 1991) the average degree of new infectious (diamonds, crosses) and contact traced nodes for disassortatively mixed networks is plotted in figure 5a. the prevalence of traced nodes (dashed line) for assortatively mixed networks is illustrated in figure 5a. the final epidemic size R(), the proportion of nodes that become triggering nodes via clinical signs or screening and the proportion of nodes that have been contact traced during the epidemic are plotted in figure 6 as a function of tracing probability for disassortatively and assortatively mixed networks. the effect of contact tracing is similar on both networks with comparable R(). over the epidemic, susceptible nodes are on average of lower degree and are more difficult to reach. on disassortatively mixed networks, the depletion of highly connected nodes is less marked and epidemics persist. disease spread alternating between highly and less well-connected nodes producing an average degree of newly infected nodes which is more even in time. the final epidemic size is similar to the point at which contact tracing starts to perform better on disassortatively mixed networks. the behaviour in this regime can be explained by interpreting contact tracing as a mechanism acting to reduce the effective transmission probability Tp past the first generation of infection. insets show ratios between number of infected nodes in consecutive generations. single-step versus multi-step tracing is not always logistically feasible. in multiple-step tracing, a triggering node can generate other triggering nodes. this leads to tracing a higher number of infectious nodes and reducing the number of links that successfully transmit the disease. the size of the giant component (GC) represents the upper limit for the potential size of an epidemic. in figure 2, the structural differences of preferentially mixed networks are demonstrated by the size of the GC as a function of the cut-off parameter K. in disassortatively mixed networks, nodes of high degree preferentially connect to each other and form a highly connected core group. for low link density, a larger GC size is found than for either disassortatively mixed or random networks at low link density. k1.7 supports only a narrow range of epidemiological parameters over which large epidemics can occur. the networks used below were generated using the same parameter values. only nodes with k3 were accepted during the network generation process. final epidemic size approaches its asymptote, total network size, faster for disassortatively mixed networks. the two networks with r=0.2 and 0.2 produce approximately equal epidemic sizes at 0.0528 (transmission probability Tp0.15). threshold for epidemic outbreaks occurs at lower infection probabilities for assortatively mixed networks than for either disassortatively mixed or random networks. the average degree of new infectious (diamonds, crosses) and contact traced nodes for disassortatively mixed networks over time. epidemics with fast turnover and quick initial growth rate allow contact tracing to remove a larger number of highly connected nodes early on in the epidemic. in contrast, disease spread is slower, but contact tracing is also less efficient. for comparison purposes, we contrast cases where R() is the same on both assortatively and disassortatively mixed networks. contact tracing removes nodes of higher degree (figure 5b) than on disassortatively mixed networks. over the epidemic, susceptible nodes are on average of lower degree. over the epidemic, susceptible nodes are on average of lower degree. in the regime of more effective control (0.61), the epidemics die out early on and susceptible depletion becomes less important. this is illustrated in figure 7 showing that the depletion of susceptibles is only found at low values. this is also reflected in the very rapid reduction of Rg (i.e. average reproduction ratio in generation g) below 1 when is high. a small decrease in transmission probability has a more marked effect on final epidemic size than on assortatively mixed networks. this supports the higher contact-tracing efficacy observed on disassortatively mixed networks. in the absence of tracing the same R() is observed on both networks. in figure 8, the faster decrease in the proportion of traced nodes with increasing tracing probability indicates earlier and more effective control in the case of multiple-step contact tracing. this indicates earlier and more effective control in the case of multiple-step contact tracing compared with the single-step case. this is counterbalanced by contact tracing that removes. the higher average degree of traced nodes is a reflection of the average degree of nodes becoming infected earlier on in the epidemic. this combined with the depletion of highly connected nodes, accentuated by finite size effects, leads to a higher average degree of traced nodes when compared with the average degree of infected nodes. this combined with the depletion of highly connected nodes, accentuated by finite size effects, leads to a higher average degree of traced no the model presented here does not incorporate time or resource constraints for contact tracing. the faster time course of the epidemic on assortatively mixed networks is more likely to stretch resources in real situations. this suggests it is difficult to exploit network structure to achieve better control via tracing. effect of network mixing patterns at the level of nodes and links rsif20071272s02.doc (52.5KB, doc)"}
