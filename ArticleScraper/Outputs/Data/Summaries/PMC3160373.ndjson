{"summary": "the study aims to explore European HCWs' perceptions and attitudes towards monitoring their absence and symptom reports for surveillance of newly circulating infections. a pre-requisite will be tackling the drivers for symptomatic HCWs to attend work. healthcare workers are at the frontline of any public health outbreak response. in the past, hospitals have become amplifiers of newly emerging infections due to transmission from patients to HCWs. monitoring HCWs' health could provide an important opportunity to detect newly circulating infections earlier, enhancing current efforts for their identification and control. international partners in the aforementioned countries employed a targeted recruitment strategy. the aim of the research was to explore a specific topic in the context of a diverse range of views. GE, GT, TE, ES and GP identified and emailed potential participants. german group 1 urban hospitals n = 3 Hospital hygienist 2 Hospital hygienist 3 Senior physician and hospital hygienist 3 Hungary group 1 urban hospitals n = 6 Physician, hospital epidemiologist and head of hospital hygiene and epidemiology department. discussions were conducted in the primary language of the host country and audio recorded. recruitment, participants and setting We used qualitative research methods to obtain a variety of attitudes, views and opinions. we sought to bring together healthcare professionals from similar settings, sharing similar experiences, but from diverse cultural and professional backgrounds. a waiver was granted from participating institutions.

country. transcripts were transcribed verbatim and back-translated into English. transcripts were coded and analysed by two independent authors. a breakdown in infection control procedures was deemed acceptable in some situations. some participants in Hungary expressed the view that they have'more pressing issues' than following infection control procedures, such as'saving lives' participants' statements on their perceptions of illness and sickness-related absence are presented in appendix 3. a framework for a syndromic surveillance system was described to participants whereby absent staff would be encouraged to report symptoms for daily monitoring and identification of potential outbreaks. participants in germany were less in favour of the suggestion employers enquire about and formally record reported symptoms as part of absence data recording. they expressed the need for the protection of employee privacy and confidentiality and thought the risks associated with nosocomial transmission of EIDs were too small to compromise these rights. participants queried the heterogeneity in absence reporting across professions and working groups within the hospital. they said there was a complete lack of structure in absence reporting among senior staff. participants criticised the lack of funding and resources supplied to occupational health departments. participants described experiences of nosocomial infectious disease transmission in terms of infections they had acquired or witnessed colleagues acquire. common infections to be gastrointestinal and respiratory viruses, and less common meningitis, hepatitis, TB and HIV. they identified risk factors for occupationally acquired infections to be exposure to patients with undiagnosed infectious diseases. participants commented on the varying illness behaviour patterns and absence reporting practices across professions. they stated that only severe symptoms such as high fever and acute pain would encourage higher level staff to be absent. in Hungary, staff sick leave entitlements amount to less than their actual pay, further motivating HCWs to come to work when unwell. participants in Hungary and Greece were also positive towards the concept of monitoring symptom reports. they agreed this would lead to the earlier identification of outbreaks and improved management. however, they were sceptical as to how effective this would be for EIDs. the lack of experience and low perceived risks of exposure to new pathogens would minimise awareness among hospital staff, leading to reduced suspicion and increased delay to the recognition of a new pathogen. the need for HCWs to be discriminating as to which symptoms to report could result in wide variation in reporting practice, again potentially undermining the validity of the system. the current practice for sick HCWs to visit their own general practice doctors highlighted the potential inability for these to identify unusual symptoms. there was consensus on the need to expand standard management and control guidelines of infectious disease outbreaks in the work place beyond those for gastrointestinal infections. but participants lacked confidence in the ability of these departments to manage staff with acute infections and perform epidemiological investigations. participants criticised the lack of funding and minor role of occupational health departments in managing the health of hospital staff. they felt occupational health departments maintained an independence making them well placed for the management of personal health data and symptomatic staff. some of the key findings here have been highlighted in the 2009 NHS Health and Well-Being Review Interim Report [14]. these include under-resourced occupational health services and uncertainty over the role and function of these departments. the issue of HCWs coming to work when feeling unwell, and the perception that senior managers or the employing organisations fail to take a positive interest in HCWs' health. grounds for variation in HCWs' perceptions on appropriateness to ask to report symptoms seem to be cultural, with participants in Germany holding stronger views on the need to protect privacy and confidentiality. there is a need for more education on infectious disease epidemiology among hospital staff. risk factors for occupationally acquired infections to be exposure to undiagnosed infectious patients, especially in accident and emergency wards, break-down in infection control procedures, immuno-navety and symptomatic colleagues. further concern was a lack of monitoring and guidelines allowing health professionals to work whilst infectious. focus group participants may not be representative of healthcare worker and hospital populations. group dynamics may have influenced individual participants' responses in a way perceived to be culturally desirable. not all EU countries were represented in this analysis. study by Blake et al. found a loss in income was associated with the general working population's ability to comply with recommendations during an influenza pandemic in the us. 55% of workers without sick pay compared to 37% with, would attend work with an infectious disease [17] the resonance across countries in underfunded occupational health departments is worrying as is the poor understanding of the risk and consequences of nosocomial outbreaks. in the uk, sick leave currently costs the national health service 10.3 million working days and \u00a31.7 billion per year, with higher rates than anywhere else in the public or private sector. pilot studies will need to be tailored to specific countries and hospitals. participants' views on risk factors for occupationally acquired infections higher risk in A & E wards. infection control (UK) may break down when not having equipment. in everyday, real life, there is not sufficient supply of protective gear. current monitoring systems (Hungary) \"hope there would be an outbreak in some other country,\" says germany. infection control (UK) may break down when not having equipment. \"in everyday, real life, there

each person becomes. \"we all are a bit unsympathetic to our own needs as staff,\" says a ward manager. \"they may be more concerned that there will be nobody to replace them,\" says a ward manager. germany's employees don't take sickies, because the economy is now worsening. \"it's a bit ironic because the advice we gave to relatives was if you had any symptoms, if you had a cold, if anything then you shouldn't come and visit,\" he says. \"we all have the tendency to come to work even if we don't feel well,\" he says. ward managers may be more concerned that there will be nobody to replace them, and there will be inadequate staffing. \"we curse them (the absent HCWs) because they've left you in a position where you've got no staff again,\" says hungary. \"the economy is now worsening and it tends to make people get their acts together\" healthcare workers' willingness to report infectious disease symptoms for surveillance purposes Factors contributing to willingness to report symptoms Genuine illness (UK) \"if you're genuinely ill and you've got nothing to hide then I'd be comfortable, it wouldn't bother me, I'd tell everything,\" he says. \"we all have the tendency to come to work even if we don't feel well,\" he says. hepatitis positive staff has the same symptoms, so it is often fed back like that. if the whole process were structured, it would be a refusal. \"people will ring up and say I can't come in, I've got abdo pain,\" he says. workers' council would be the key issue and confidentiality would make it very difficult in Germany to find a regulation. perceived benefits of monitoring Identify staff absenteeism (UK) genuine illness (UK) \"if you're genuinely ill and you've got nothing to hide then I'd be comfortable, it wouldn't bother me, I'd tell everything\" if all the staff were educated on that, like if you've got D&V, please report it, surely they should take a little bit of ownership and report it\" 'i feel lousy' or 'i am retching all the time, and vomiting' 'i feel lousy' 'i am retching all the time, and vomiting' and then you get the next person who says 'i also had that last week' 'i certainly wouldn't tell you what kind of symptoms I have,' he said. \"most of the times when (sick leave) notes are composed they are not real, so this inflicts distrustfulness and false information within the data given on files\" when they received the note they are quite healthy.
