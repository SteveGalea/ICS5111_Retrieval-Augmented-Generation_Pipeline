{"summary": "the most serious epidemic caused by an emerging human coronaviruses (HCoVs) occurred in 2002\u20132003, when the global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS-CoV, resulted in a case fatality rate of 10% (2). the first two-thirds of the giant coronavirus genome contains two overlapping open reading frames, ORF1a and ORF1b. they encode two viral replicase polyproteins, pp1a from ORF1a and pp1ab that results from a 1 frameshift between ORF1a and ORF1b. the polyproteins are then processed by viral papain-like proteases (PLPs) and a 3C-like protease (3CL the structures of the three MHV nsp3 domains determined in this study are underscored with dashed lines. the currently known nsp3 domains are indicated at the top and are shaded according to the color code of the corresponding domains. structural information of most CoVs\u2032 nsp3 is still missing. the SARS-unique domain (SUD) consists of three domains, the N-terminal domain (SUD-N), the middle domain (SUD-M), and the C-terminal domain (SUD-C) it was originally proposed that the SUD domain is unique to only SARS-CoV (24), and it was predicted to exist only in SARS and bat CoVs within the -corona PLpro and HCoV-NL63 PLP2 have been shown to interfere with the IRF3 and NF-B signaling pathways for interferon (IFN) production. most recently, it was discovered that MERS-CoV PLpro displays IFN antagonism activity (25, 29, 37) however, the ability of purified MHV PLP2 enzyme to remove ubiquitin and ISG15 from substrates has not yet been demonstrated. expression and purification of PLP2+ in Escherichia coli cells was the same as described previously (23). the procedure for purification of PLP2+ was the same as described previously for wild-type, unlabeled PLP2+ (23). the procedure for WT PLP2+ except the induction with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio--d-galactopyranoside was performed at 18 \u00b0C for overnight instead of at 25 \u00b0C for 6 h. the cell pellet from 500 ml of culture was resuspended in 40 ml of Buffer A. the concentration of PLP2+ was measured through the bio-Rad Bradford protein assay. the substrate was purchased from BaChem, whereas Ub-AMC and ISG15-AMC were purchased from Boston Biochem. product produced per unit time (m/min) using the extinction coefficient of the product (arbitrary fluorescence units/m) determined following the procedure. plots of initial velocities versus substrate concentrations were fit to the equation, v/[E] = kapp[S], where kapp represents the apparent rate constant (kcat/Km) at which the reaction rate is half-maximum. ubiquitin chain-cleaving reactions performed by incubating a 2 m concentration of each chain listed above with a 20 nm concentration of recombinant PLP2+ in buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, and 2 mm DTT) at 25 \u00b0C for various times ranging from 5 min to 2 h. the optimal crystallization condition consisted of 100 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 4% PEG 400, 2 m (NH4)2SO4, and 5 mm DTT. crystals were then stored in a Dewar under liquid nitrogen until data collection. both data sets were processed and scaled using HKL2000 (41) the native data set and the SeMet peak data set were processed and scaled to 2.60 and 2.80 respectively. initial phases were determined through the single-wavelength anomalous dispersion method.

HEK293T cells were transfected using 50 ng of Renilla luciferase, 100 ng of IFN-luc, and the indicated PLP expression plasmids described previously (23). to express selenomethionine (SeMet)-substituted PLP2+, pEV-L8-PLP2+ was transformed into E. coli strain B834 cells. two liters of cells were grown in M9 medium at 37 \u00b0C until the A600 reached 0.6. cells were then lysed by sonication and clarified with centrifugation. unbound proteins were washed with 20 column volumes of Buffer A. bound proteins were then eluted with 7 ml of 100% Buffer B. assay buffer contained 50 mm

conditions for MHV PLP2+ were first identified after performing a high-throughput crystallization screen using commercial crystallization screens from Qiagen. 1 l of purified MHV PLP2+ at three concentrations (6, 12, and 24 mg/ml) was pipetted into the three subwells of a 96-3 well sitting drop plate (Greiner CrystalQuick crystallization plate), and 1 l of reservoir solution was then added the optimal crystallization condition consisted of 100 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 4% PEG 400, 2 m (NH4)2SO4 and 5 mm DTT. crystals of MHV PLP2+ were harvested using nylon loops and then placed into reservoir solution supplemented with 20% glycerol. the improved model was then further refined using Phenix Refine. data collection and refinement statistics are shown in Table 2. b Rpim = hkl(1/n 1) i|Ii(hkl)

simulation indicated an immediate opening of the \u201ccollapsed\u201d fingertip region of MHV PLP2 beyond the positions observed in various liganded and unliganded SARS-CoV PLpro structures. a conformational state that is the most similar to the one found in the SARS-CoV PLpro-Ubal complex was also subject to a molecular dynamics simulation. expression and purification of PLP2+ followed the procedure described previously. purified PLP2+ was concentrated to 12 mg/ml for protein crystallization or flash-frozen in the same buffer with the addition of glycerol to a final concentration of 2%. expression of mutants followed the procedure for wild-type, unlabeled PLP2+. induction with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio--d-galactopyranoside was performed at 18 \u00b0C for overnight instead of at 25 \u00b0C for 6 h. the specific activity of PLP2+ was determined using a 50 m concentration of the Z-RLRGG-AMC substrate. the substrate was purchased from BaChem, while Ub-AMC and ISG15-AMC were purchased from Boston Biochem. the reaction in units of fluorescence per unit time (m/min) was converted to the amount of product produced per unit time (m/min) using the extinction coefficient of the product (arbitrary fluorescence units/m) determined following the procedure as described in (25) ubiquitin chain-cleaving reactions were performed by incubating a 2 m concentration of each ubiquitin chain listed above with a 20 nm concentration of recombinant PLP2+ in buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, and 2 mm DTT). initial crystals were small, with the longest dimension only 0.05 mm. further optimization of the crystallization conditions was carried out manually using 24-well sitting drop plates at 20 \u00b0C using a fine grid of 100 mm HEPES between pH 6.8 and pH 8.3. the native data set and the SeMet peak data set were processed and scaled to 2.60 and 2.80 respectively. initial phases were determined through the single-wavelength anomalous dispersion method

simulation of a non-covalent complex to allow for extra flexibility at the C terminus of Ub. a state with optimal interaction energetics, characterized by a comparatively high number of hydrogen-bonding, hydrophobic, and favorable electrostatic contacts was used as the complex model thereafter. the persistence of the interactions between PLP2 and Ubal during the simulation was calculated. pEV-L8-PLP2+ was transformed into strain B834 cells. two liters of cells were grown in M9 medium at 37 \u00b0C. expression of PLP2+ mutants followed the procedure for WT PLP2+. unbound

the trajectory of the simulation indicated an immediate opening of the \u201ccollapsed\u201d fingertip region of MHV PLP2 beyond the positions observed in various liganded and unliganded SARS-CoV PLpro structures. the MHV PLP2+ catalytic core (pp1ab residues 1668\u20131911) was expressed and purified from E. coli. the final purified protein is a 389-amino acid protein (43.5 kDa) two additional residues at the N terminus resulting from removal of the octahistidine tag after tobacco etch virus protease cleavage. the kinetic parameters of MHV PLP2+ with substrates RLRGG-AMC, Ub-AMC, and ISG15-AMC are from Baez-Santos et al. (25). kapp is calculated to approximate kcat/Km. MHV PLP2+ (Ub-AMC > ISG15-AMC Z-RLRGG-AMC) is 17-fold more efficiently than ISG15-AMC. MHV PLP2+ is capable of cleaving all diubiquitins with isopeptide bonds into monoubiquitins but not linear-Ub. hydrolyses of Lys11-, Lys48- and Lys63-linked di-Ubs are the most efficient. after 2 h, these di-Ubs have been completely processed to mono-Ub. unreacted substrate still remains for Lys6-, Lys27-, Lys29-, and Lys33-linked di-Ubs. the data show that PLP2+ processes Lys48-Ub4 and Lys63-Ub6. x-ray data set on a native crystal was collected to 2.60 resolution. multiple attempts to determine the structure of MHV PLP2+ proved unsuccessful. the final MHV PLP2+ structural model had observable electron density for residues 1533\u20131910. the first 10 N-terminal and last C-terminal residues had weak or unobservable electron density. the crystal structure of the MHV PLP2 catalytic core and flanking N-terminal and Ubl2 domains consists of five domains: fingers, palm, thumb, Ubl2 and DPUP. the zinc atom in the fingertip of the fingers domain is shown as a gray sphere. the four zinc-coordinating cysteines from the fingers domain are represented as sticks. the root mean square deviation between the two structures is 2.1 over 63 aligned C atoms. the domain consists of two helices (1 and 2) that are connected by five anti-parallel -strands (1\u20135). a DALI search (47) of this unpredicted domain against the PDB identified the C domain of the SARS unique domain (SUD-C) as the top match. the root mean square deviation is 2.1 over 63 aligned backbone C atoms. asn1714, which is conserved among coronaviral PLPs, may also participate in stabilizing the oxyanion hole. X-ray refinement with a partially occupied cysteic acid was able to account for the residual electron density. partial or complete oxidation of the catalytic cysteine is commonly observed in crystal structures of cysteine proteases due to both the highly reactive nature of the side chain thiol group and its ability to coordinate thiophilic the Cys-His-Asp catalytic triads from these PLPs are well aligned. however, several differences in the structures are observed from the overlay. whereas the local geometry of the zinc-binding site is maintained in all these structures, the fingertip regions have different conformations and differing extent of opening/closure. the color code is the same as in A with the additional structure of inhibitor-bound SARS-CoV PLpro shown in cyan (PDB code 3E9S). the loop from MERS-CoV PLpro is omitted because it is not visible in the structure. MHV PLP2, which lacks a phenylalanine or tyrosine residue on the BL2 loop, is not affected by this series of inhibitors. MHV PLP2, which lacks a phenylalanine or tyrosine residue on the BL2 loop, is not affected by this series of inhibitors. the structure of the MHV PLpro-ubiquitin aldehyde complex (PDB code 4MM3) was used as a template to generate a model of PLP2 in complex with Ubal via molecular dynamics. the model reveals that the Ubal molecule is stabilized by numerous interactions at the canonical surface formed by the thumb-palm-fingers domains of PLP2. a potentially stable salt bridge interaction between the side chain of Arg74 and Glu1766 is observed in the PLP2-Ubal model. however, a similar interaction is absent, as suggested by both the crystal structure (40, 55) and the 1.2-ns molecular dynamics analysis of the complex. the magenta dashed line indicates that the interaction persists for more than 50% of the simulation time. only the interactions that persist for more than 50% of the simulation time are shown. extensive contacts are predicted between MHV PLP2 and the Ubal core. asp1772 and MHV PLP2 play important roles in binding Ub via regions outside of the Ub C terminus. asp1807 is poorly conserved among CoVs, implying that the interaction between Asp1807 and Ub may be unique to MHV PLP2. temperature inactivation experiments show that Y1824A is much more unstable than Y1824F. this indicates that the predicted hydrogen-bonding interaction between Tyr1824 and Ub is not crucial for the processing of Ub. however, the presence of an aromatic ring at this position is important. the replacement of Phe1812 with alanine has dire consequences to its DUB activity. the Y1824F mutant preserves the ability to antagonize IFN production. the inactive mutant loses IFN antagonism ability. the MHV PLP2+ catalytic core (pp1ab residues 1668\u20131911) was expressed and purified from E. coli. the final purified protein is a 389-amino acid protein (43.5 kDa), with two additional residues at the N terminus resulting from removal of the octahistidine tag. MHV PLP2+ catalyzes the hydrolysis of Ub-AMC 17-fold more efficiently than ISG15-AMC and 24,000-fold more efficiently than Z-RLRGG-AMC. kapp is calculated to approximate kcat/Km. substrate preference for MHV PLP2+ (Ub-AMC > ISG15-AMC Z-RLRGG-AMC) stands in contrast to the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV PLpro enzymes. both prefer ISG15-AMC by about 19- and 8,300-fold over the Z-RLRGG-AMC substrate. s63-linked di-Ubs have been completely processed to mono-Ub. unreacted substrate still remains for Lys6-, Lys27-, Lys29-, and Lys33-linked di-Ubs. crystallization and X-ray Structure Determination of MHV PLP2+ Purified MHV PLP2+ was readily crystallized by the microseeding approach from a solution containing 6 mg/ml enzyme in crystallization solution (100 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 4% PEG 400, 2 m (NH4)2SO4, and 5 mm DTT) multiple attempts to determine the structure of MHV PLP2+ through numerous molecular replacement approaches the thumb domain (aa 1668\u20131786 in the expression construct) is made up of six helices (4\u20139), with two short anti-parallel strands (11\u201312) between helices 5 and 6. the fingers domain contains two short helices, one short strand, and one -sheet consisting of four anti-parallel twisted strands. the catalytic triad residues and the four zinc-coordinating cysteines from the fingers domain are represented as sticks. the root mean square deviation between the two structures is 2.1 over 63 aligned C atoms at 13% sequence identity. the residual electron density in Fo Fc maps are colored green and contoured at 3, whereas the 2Fo Fc maps are contoured at 1. the C domain of the SARS unique domain (SUD-C) is the top match. the presence of this domain in MHV nsp3 calls into question its exclusivity. the active site of PLP2 sits between the thumb and palm domains. X-ray refinement with a partially occupied cysteic acid was able to account for the residual electron density. oxidation of the catalytic cysteine is commonly observed in crystal structures of cysteine proteases due to both the highly reactive nature of the side chain thiol group and its ability to coordinate thiophilic transition metals capable of oxidation. triads from these PLPs are well aligned. however, several differences in the structures are observed from the overlay. first, the local geometry of the zinc-binding site is maintained in all these structures. the fingertip regions have different conformations and differing extents of opening/closure with respect to the palm domains. the color code is the same as in A with the additional structure of inhibitor-bound SARS-CoV PLpro shown in cyan (PDB code 3E9S) the loop from MERS-CoV PLpro is omitted because it is not visible in the structure. MHV PLP2, which lacks a phenylalanine or tyrosine residue on the BL2 loop, is not affected by this series of inhibitors (25). MHV PLP2, which lacks a phenylalanine or tyrosine residue on the BL2 loop, is not affected by this series of inhibitors (data not shown). structure of the MHV PLP2-Ubal complex (PDB code 4MM3) reveals that the Ubal molecule is stabilized by numerous interactions at the canonical surface formed by the thumb-palm-fingers domains of PLP2. a similar network of hydrogen-bonding interactions has also been discovered in the structure of SARS-CoV PLpro-Ubal complex. a similar interaction is absent in the crystal structure (40, 55) and 1.2-ns molecular dynamics analysis of the complex. the differences in the interaction profiles between the C-terminal residues of Ubal and the active sites of MHV PLP2 and SARS-CoV PLpro do not adequately justify why the activity of PLP2 with Z-RLRGG-AMC is significantly lower. only the interactions that persist for more than 50% of the simulation time are shown. the magenta dashed line indicates that the interaction persists for more than 50% of the simulation time. asp1807 and MHV PLP2 play important roles in binding Ub via regions outside of the Ub C terminus. residues corresponding to Asp1772 in MHV PLP2 are either aspartic or glutamic acids in other CoVs except MERS-CoV PLpro (arginine) and IBV PLP2 (tryptophan) temperature inactivation experiments show that Y1824A is much more unstable than Y1824F. the packing of MHV PLP2 around residues Tyr1824 and Phe1812 is shown as a cartoon in yellow. we performed IFN antagonism assays in cell culture with several selected mutants. the Y1824F mutant preserves the ability to antagonize IFN production. the inactive mutant, Y1824A, loses IFN antagonism ability. -terminal domain (pp1a residues 1525\u20131607) and the Ubl2 domains (pp1ab residues 1608\u20131667) were expressed and purified from E. coli. the final purified protein is a 389-amino acid protein (43.5 kDa) the final purified protein is a 389-amino acid protein (43.5 kDa) MHV PLP2+ catalyzes the hydrolysis of Ub-AMC 17-fold more efficiently than ISG15-AMC. kapp is calculated to approximate kcat/Km. both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV PLpro prefer ISG15-AMC by 96- and 3,300-fold over the Z-RLRGG-AMC substrate. significant difference between the PLP2+- and PLpro-mediated hydrolysis of Ub-AMC or ISG15-AMC and Z-RLRGG-AMC suggests there are additional and important interactions between PLP2 and Ub outside of the enzyme's catalytic center. 0.5 g of di-Ub with different linkages was incubated at 25 \u00b0C with 20 nm PLP2+ for 2 h. di-Ub incubated without PLP2+ serves as negative control. a complete x-ray data set on a native crystal was collected to 2.60 resolution (Table 2). Multiple attempts to determine the structure of MHV PLP2+ proved unsuccessful. both native and SeMet PLP2+ proteins crystallized in the I213 space group with one PLP2+ monomer in the asymmetric unit. the thumb domain (aa 1668\u20131786 in the expression construct) is made up of six helices (4\u20139), with two short anti-parallel strands (11\u201312) between helices 5 and 6. the fingers domain contains two short helices, one short strand, and one -sheet consisting of four anti-parallel twisted strands. the root mean square deviation between the two structures is 2.1 over 63 aligned C atoms at 13% sequence identity. in each panel, the residual electron density in Fo Fc maps are colored green and contoured at 3, whereas the 2Fo Fc maps are contoured at 1. the MHV ubiquitin-like (Ubl2) domain (aa 1608\u20131667) is composed of a -grasp fold (46) dicted domain against the PDB identified the C domain of the SARS unique domain (SUD-C) as the top match, with a Z-score of 7.3. the root mean square deviation is 2.1 over 63 aligned backbone C atoms. the sequence identity is only 13%. X-ray refinement with a partially occupied cysteic acid was able to account for the residual electron density. partial or complete oxidation of the catalytic cysteine is commonly observed in crystal structures of cysteine proteases due to both the highly reactive nature of the side chain thiol group and its ability to coordinate thiophilic transition metals. the fingertip in PLP2 collapses toward the palm, rendering the canonical surface for ubiquitin binding too compact to accommodate the typical ubiquitin structure without some opening via conformational changes. extensive flexibility within the fingers domain has been observed in the x-ray structure of the free enzyme form (i.e. with no substrates or ligands bound) the color code is the same as in A with the additional structure of inhibitor-bound SARS-CoV PLpro shown in cyan. the loop from MERS-CoV PLpro is omitted because it is not visible in the structure. MHV PLP2, which lacks a phenylalanine or tyrosine residue on the BL2 loop, is not affected by this series of inhibitors (25). the alignment was performed using Clustal Omega. the figure was generated using ESPript (67). the resulting computational model of the MHV PLP2-Ubal complex reveals that the Ubal molecule is stabilized by numerous interactions at the canonical surface formed by the thumb-palm-fingers domains of PLP2. the C-terminal residues of Ubal extend into the narrow opening of the active site, as expected. the latter will be shown in italic type, whereas the latter will be represented in normal type. the differences in interaction profiles between the C-terminal residues of Ubal and the active sites of MHV PLP2 and SARS-CoV PLpro do not adequately justify why the activity of PLP2 with Z-RLRGG-AMC is significantly lower than that of SARS-CoV PLpro. interactions are predicted between MHV PLP2 and the Ubal core (residues 1\u201371). interactions persist for more than 50% of simulation time but is not present in the current analyzed frame. mutagenesis studies of MHV PLP2+ reveal important residues in Ub binding. p1807 is poorly conserved among CoVs, implying that the interaction between Asp1807 and Ub may be unique to MHV PLP2. residues corresponding to Asp1772 in MHV PLP2 are either aspartic or glutamic acids in other CoVs except MERS-CoV PLpro (arginine) and IBV PLP2 (tryptophan) temperature inactivation experiments show that Y1824A is much more unstable than Y1824F. MHV PLP2 is conserved as mainly aromatic or in one case a methionine. we performed IFN antagonism assays in cell culture with several selected mutants. the Y1824F mutant preserves the ability to antagonize IFN production. the inactive mutant loses IFN antagonism ability. the final purified protein is a 389-amino acid protein (43.5 kDa) the final purified protein is a 389-amino acid protein (43.5 kDa) two additional residues at the N terminus resulting from removal of the octahistidine tag after tobacco etch virus protease cleavage.

Multiple attempts to determine the structure of MHV PLP2+ proved unsuccessful. both native and SeMet PLP2+ proteins crystallized in the I213 space group with one PLP2+ monomer in the asymmetric unit. the thumb domain (aa 1668\u20131786 in the expression construct) is made up of six helices (4\u20139), with two short anti-parallel strands (11\u201312) between helices 5 and 6. the fingers domain contains two short helices, one short strand, and one -sheet consisting of four anti-parallel twisted strands. the occupancies of the oxygen atoms in the sulfonic acid group were set to 0.5. in each panel, the residual electron density in Fo Fc maps are colored green and contoured at 3, whereas the 2Fo Fc maps are colored blue and contoured at 1. the MHV ubiquitin-like (Ubl2) domain (aa 1608\u20131667) is composed of a -grasp fold (46) the presence of this domain in MHV nsp3 calls into question its exclusivity. the active site of PLP2 sits between the thumb and palm domains. the active site of PLP2 sits between the thumb and palm domains. oxidation of the catalytic cysteine is common in crystal structures of cysteine proteases due to both the highly reactive nature of the side chain thiol group and its ability to coordinate thiophilic transition metals capable of oxidation. the fingertip in PLP2 collapses toward the palm, rendering the canonical surface for ubiquitin binding too compact to accommodate the typical ubiquitin structure without some opening via conformational changes. extensive flexibility within the fingers domain has been observed in the x-ray structure of the free enzyme form (i.e. with no substrates or ligands bound) of SARS-CoV PLpro. the loop from MERS-CoV PLpro is omitted because it is not visible in the structure. another region with significant differences among the PLPs is the L19-20 loop in PLP2 (sequence: 1868GGSVG1872) this loop is expected to be highly flexible. MHV PLP2 is not affected by this series of inhibitors. group 1, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63; group 2, MHV, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1; group 3, IBV. the resulting computational model of the MHV PLP2-Ubal complex reveals that the Ubal molecule is stabilized by numerous interactions at the canonical surface formed by the thumb-palm-fingers domains of PLP2. the C-terminal residues of Ubal extend into the narrow opening of the active site, as expected. the latter will be shown in italic type, whereas the latter will be represented in normal type. differences in interactions between the C-terminal residues of Ubal and the active sites of MHV PLP2 and SARS-CoV PLpro do not adequately justify why the activity of PLP2 with Z-RLRGG-AMC is significantly lower than that of SARS-CoV PLpro. additional interactions that were not predicted by the molecular dynamics run may play an important role in the reduction of MHV PLP2+ activity against Z-RLRGG-AMC. asp1772, Arg1775, and Asp1807 each engage in salt bridge interactions with Arg42, Glu51, and Lys48 respectively. the more complementary charge contacts that exist in the MHV PLP2-Ubal complex but not the SARS-CoV PLpro-Ubal complex may account for the much lower Km of PLP2+ with Ub-AMC. residues corresponding to Asp1772 in MHV PLP2 are either aspartic or glutamic acids in other CoVs except MERS-CoV PLpro (arginine) and IBV PLP2 (tryptophan) Glu168, which corresponds to Asp1772 in SARS-CoV PLpro, has also been shown to be important for interacting with Ub (55) MHV PLP2 is conserved as aromatic or in one case a methionine. the color code is the same as in A, except carbon atoms of Ile44 and Val70 are shown in yellow. we performed IFN antagonism assays in cell culture with several selected mutants. the Y1824F mutant preserves the ability to antagonize IFN production. the inactive mutant loses IFN antagonism ability. x-ray structure reveals a domain preceding the Ubl2 domain in MHV nsp3. MHV PLP2+ can process di-Ubs of all linkage types. MHV PLP2+ may require external assistance, such as other domains in nsp3 to achieve substrate discrimination. ubiquitin chains are cleaved much faster than the longer ubiquitin chains. MHV PLP2+ most likely has only one ubiquitin binding site. the DPUP domain was believed to be unique to SARS-CoV. we have attempted to investigate the ability of the DPUP domain to bind oligonucleotides. however, the results were inconclusive (data not shown) the presence of the DPUP domain in MHV nsp3 suggests that SUD should no longer be considered \u201cunique\u201d to SARS-CoV. nsp3 has been shown to play a crucial role in inducing the formation of double-membrane vehicles (57) proteomics analysis of virions has described nsp3 as the \u201chub of connectivity\u201d because it makes the most interactions with other viral proteins, implying a critical role of nsp3 in virion assembly. DPUP domain, the Ubl domain, and the PLP2 domain have been shown to be capable of deubiquitinating TBK1 in cell-based assays. adenovirus, nairovirus, arterivirus, and herpesvirus have also been found to encode proteases that have deubiquitinating/deISGylating activities. author contributions Y.
