{"summary": "mutation rate is an important determinant of evolutionary rate across taxa. mutation rate is the rate at which errors are made during replication of the viral genome. mutation rate is the rate at which mutations become fixed, or present within all individuals, in a population. higher per-site mutation rates of RNA viruses can be explained in part by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) that replicate their genomes. notable exceptions are members of the Nidovirales family, including coronaviruses, toroviruses, and roniviruses. mutation rates of over 25 viruses have been experimentally measured in a laboratory setting. these rates range from 108 to 106 s/n/c for DNA viruses and 106 to 104 s/n/c for RNA viruses (5, 19). this highlights the importance of additional factors in determining the evolutionary rate, such as within-host dynamics (4) or cell tropism (8). Mutational spectra Biased against lethal and deleterious mutations Context-dependent effects RT-PCR errors (for RNA viruses) Easier to exclude sequencing errors Mutation accumulation (mutation frequency) Less biased against deleterious mutations Biased against lethal mutations Mutational spectra Requires extensive passaging to accumulate large sample size Context-dependent effects Decline in population fitness. most mutations are lethal or deleterious, a minority are neutral, and only a few are beneficial (13, 15, 16) methods that rely on mutation frequencies are biased against lethal and/or deleterious mutations. the most common approach is to sequence individual clones or perform high depth-of-coverage sequencing of an entire population after a defined number of passages. mutation rate is the rate at which mutations occur in a viral genome. mutation rates are reported as either substitutions per nucleotide per round of copying (s/n/r) or substitutions per nucleotide per cell infection (s/n/c) the distinction between these units is based on whether viruses replicate via a \u201cstamping machine\u201d model. a green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene was introduced into the influenza A virus genome. three codons crucial for the fluorescence of the GFP protein were mutated. reversion of a specific nucleotide could result in restoration of the fluorescent phenotype. a variety of techniques have been developed and used to investigate fidelity for many RNA viruses. mutation rates can evolve through the fixation of mutator and antimutator alleles in a population. mutation rates can evolve through the fixation of mutator and antimutator alleles in a population. selection against mutators should result in mutation rates being pushed ever lower. a longstanding question in evolutionary biology is why mutation rates have not evolved to be zero. the drift-barrier hypothesis posits that drift prevents mutation rates from reaching zero. the physicochemical limit hypothesis posits that the cost of perfect polymerase function pushes the mutation rate away from zero. lower mutation rates impose a higher biochemical cost. a mutator allele can increase frequency to fixation by hitchhiking and a beneficial mutation that it produced, thereby increasing the mutation rate of the population as a whole (34). because a mutator allele must remain linked to a beneficial mutation to hitchhike to fixation, this is more likely to occur in viruses with low recombination rates. a higher mutation rate might be favored because it correlates with increased replication speed (18, 36, 37) a faster replicator would have a substantial fitness advantage over a slower one. a faster replicator would have a substantial fitness advantage over a slower one. mutation rate evolution has been widely discussed in the fields of virology and population genetics (34, 36) further studies that can disentangle specific mechanisms will help to elucidate what selective forces shape the observed mutation rates and which of the above hypotheses might be the most applicable to viruses. computational studies have shown that selection can result in a mutation rate that is suboptimal, specifically in terms of long-term adaptability (45). other studies suggest that some viruses replicate at an optimal mutation rate, but specifically within the context of immune escape (33)."}
