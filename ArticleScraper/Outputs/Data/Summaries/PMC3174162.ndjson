{"summary": "a vaccine against HIV-1 would need to induce a neutralizing antibody, CD4+ Th, and competent CD8+ CTL responses at the initial site of viral entry. vaccinia virus (VV) has been used as a smallpox vaccine. it helped eradicate smallpox worldwide. recombinant wild vaccinia virus can induce only limited mucosal immune responses specific to foreign antigens, even at high doses. recombinant vaccinia viruses can induce only limited mucosal immune responses specific to foreign antigens, even at high doses. helial cells released antigens in a polarized way. both the progeny vaccinia virus and HIV antigen are preferentially released from the apical surfaces. colchicine treatment causes unpolarized antigen expression, delivery, and enhanced specific immune responses. the virus was homologously recombined with the gagpol gene from HIV-1 B\u2032 and a gfp gene to replace most of the vaccinia virus HA gene. cells were frozen and thawed three times and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 20 minutes. supernatants were aspirated, aliquoted, and stored at 70\u00b0C. mice in the control group were i.n. primed by rVTT-gagpol (107 PFU/mouse, 12 l) and colchicine (40 g/mouse, 10 g/l, 4 l) 24 hours before immunization with rVTT-gagpol (107 PFU/mouse, 12 l) both vaginal washes and BW were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 minutes. heparinized (20 U/ml) blood was collected and centrifuged at 2000 rpm. nasal washes and lung bronchial washes were collected in 1 ml DMEM with 1% (P+S) and 10% FBS. decalcification solution was maintained at 4\u201310\u00b0C by immersing it in a beaker with ice, which was refreshed every 5\u201310 minutes for 1 hour. both the lung and the decalcified nasal turbinate samples underwent serial dehydration and were imbedded in paraffin and cut into slices 2 m thick. serial 10-fold dilutions were inoculated for 2 hours. each plate was incubated for 48 hours, and 0.2 ml of 5 mg/ml crystal violet in 10% formaldehyde was added to fix and stain the cell layers. plates were tested in a microplate spectrophotometer (Multiskan MK3, Thermo LabSystems) at 405 nm and readouts calibrated with blanks. Titers of the samples were calculated from endpoint dilutions twice the negative value. the linear range was 0.005 ng/ml to 0.1 ng/ml. the p24 concentration of the sample was computed using the equation. rVTT-gagpol infection of Caco-2 cells was infected with rVTT. colchicine (0.08 mg/ml) was added to polarized Caco-2 cell layers 72 hours before infection. apical and basolateral media were collected and fresh medium was added. p24 and viral titer were determined by ELISA and plaque assay. both were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. female mice were chosen because previous studies have suggested nasal priming does not work well in male mice. immunoization Mice were primed and boosted with 107 PFU/mouse of rVTT-gagpol (12 l) at 0 and 4 weeks. they were euthanized at week 6. vaginal washes were aspirated into the vaginal tract using 200-l tips. trachea was exposed surgically and breast diaphragm opened for lung expansion. a 1-ml tip covered with a 10-l tip was used to aspirate 500-l PBS. the nasal turbinate and lungs were separately homogenized in 1 ml DMEM with 1% (P+S) and 10% FBS. mice were bled and euthanized after immunization. the samples were visualized using diaminobenzidine (DAB) kit (Maixin-Bio) before primary antibody incubation, they were washed three times with PBS with 0.02% (v/v) Tween 20. slides were counterstained with hematoxylin solution. serial 4-fold dilutions of sample in PBS (0.5% BSA) were added to the plates and incubated for 2 hours at 37\u00b0C. goat anti-mouse IgG-AP (12000, Southern Biotech) or goat anti-mouse IgA-AP (12000, Southern Biotech ) in PBS (0.5% BSA) was added and incubated for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C. mouse anti-p24-HRP antibody (11200) was added and incubated for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C. colorimetric conversion of substrate reagent was used for 10\u201320 minutes at room temperature. p24 and viral titer were determined by ELISA and plaque assay. cells on filters were cut free of plastic inserts, postfixed in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, at 4\u00b0C for 2\u20134 hours. Statistical comparisons were conducted using GraphPad Prism, version 4. results Effects of high doses of rVTT-gagpol on levels of mucosal humoral immune response after intra-nasal immunization. pol, lung washes, and vaginal washes taken during week 6 were collected to ascertain anti-p24 IgG and IgA by ELISA. the results of one representative experiment were similar to those reported by other groups. in one study, 5106 PFU/mouse of vaccinia virus was given to mice at 0 and 4 weeks. rVTT-gagpol was inoculated from the apical side. then small, local cytopathic effects appeared in the cell layer. the infected cell monolayer was fixed and processed for electronic microscopy. some viral factories were present in the cell plasma. p24 content and virus titers of the samples were determined by ELISA and plaque assay. the kinetics of p24 and virus distribution post-infection are shown in Figures 3E and F. the virus was found to replicate at about 106 PFU/well in cells. it was released from the apical surface at about 104\u2013105PFU/well. this is about 1000 times the level in the basolateral medium. even when the medium was changed every 48 hours, the kinetics showed similar trends. p24 expression and distribution took on similar trends. largest amount of expression was achieved, about 70 ng per mouse. six-week-old female mice were inoculated with 1107 PFU of rVTT-gagpol. p24 levels were detected at 24 hours and the highest at 72 hours. fewer viruses reached the lungs and peak viral titer reached 106 PFU per mouse. rVTT-gagpol was found capable of infecting the epithelial cells of the nose and lungs. colchicine is a drug that inhibits microtubule polymerization. it can cause unpolarized release of the Junin virus in polarized vero cells. the unpolarized groups consisted of infected, unpolarized cells. rVTT-gagpol was then inoculated. caco-2 cell layers were infected with rVTT-gagpol 14\u201316 days after polarization. a similar group was treated with colchicine apically 72 hours before rVTT-gagpol infection to form the polarized + colchicine group. in both the 3 m and 0.4 m transwells, colchicine treatment induced basolateral viral and p24 release. colchicine treatment 72 hours before rVTT-gagpol infection was found to cause unpolarized release of virus and p24 in vitro. the impact of colchicine on antigen distribution was explored in mice epithelia. the rVTT-gagpol immunization group was given identical treatment except that PBS was used as a substitute for colchicine. infection and expression kinetics in nose samples, nasal washes, lung samples, and lung bronchial washes were evaluated. the level of p24 in the lamina propria of both groups was low. at 72 hours, the colchicine-treated group expressed p24 at much higher levels than the rVTT-gagpol immunization group in both the epithelia and the lamina propria. body weight decreased after immunization but was restored about 10 days later. the serum IgA was about 5 times higher than the lung bronchial wash IgA titer. the vaginal wash IgA titer was about 3 times higher. the mucosal level of IgA increased and systematic effects were observed. the influence on antibody response at 20 g was similar to that at 40 g. but 4-g doses had no significant effects on anything but serum IgA titer. the conditions of colchicine treatment for detection of antigen distribution differed slightly from those used for evaluation of immune responses. however, the results shown in Figure 7 were both reproducible and consistent with the idea that colchicine enhances immune response. high-dose rVTT-gagpol immunization could induce high levels of p24-specific IgG in serum but only low IgA titers. mice were i.n. inoculated with rVTT-gagpol at weeks 0 and 4 and euthanized during week 6. in vitro, mucosal epithelial cell lines cultured on a permeable membrane can become polarized monolayers. in this study, the human colonic carcinoma Caco-2 cell line was cultured and developed into polarized cell layers. rVTT-gagpol was inoculated from the apical side and developed into polarized cell layers. infection, expression, and distribution of rVTT-gagpol in polarized Caco-2 cell monolayers. at various times, monolayers were fixed and prepared for electronic microscopy observation. p24 content and virus titers of samples were determined by ELISA and plaque assay. the p24 in VLP was evaluated using 1% TritonX-100. for total p24, about 10 ng/well was found to be present in the cells. about 1\u20138 ng/well was present in the apical medium. none was detected in the basolateral medium. p24 was expressed in respiratory system but not in the blood. p24 expression and distribution took on similar trends. largest amount of expression was achieved, about 70 ng per mouse, at 72 hours. nose section (G) 24 hours and (H) 72 hours after i.n. inoculation with rVTT-gagpol. at 72 hours, there was a little p24 in the epithelium of nose. at 72 hours, there was more p24 but large amounts remained in the epithelium. amount was found in lamina propria (Fig. 4H) in the lungs, little p24 was observed at 24 hours. rVTT-gagpol was found capable of infecting the epithelial cells of the nose and lungs. p24 immunohistochemistry results were considered representative of viral distribution. the unpolarized group consisted of infected, unpolarized cells. rVTT-gagpol cells were cultured in transwell for 3 days. a similar group was treated with colchicine apically 72 hours before rVTT-gagpol infection. in the colchicine-treated group, polarized budding was disturbed. the trend of distribution was similar to that of the unpolarized group. in the colchicine-treated group, TER decreased in the 3 m transwell. but increased in the 0.4 m transwell at low concentrations (2 mg/ml) in the lung and lung bronchial washes, both p24 and virus levels were much higher after 48 hours. after 72 hours, both began to decrease, reaching their lowest points at 96 hours. no virus or p24 was detected in the blood of colchicine-treated or control mice. colchicine-treated group expressed p24 in the epithelium at a much higher rate than the rVTT-gagpol immunization group in both the epithelia and the lamina propria. at 72 hours, the colchicine-treated group expressed p24 at much higher levels than the rVTT-gagpol immunization group in both the epithelia and the lamina propria. the mice were inoculated with colchicine (4 g) 24 hours before rVTT-gagpol inoculation. anti-p24 immune responses were significantly stronger than in the control group. the serum IgG titer was about 5 times higher than the controls. t-testing was conducted between the colchicine-treated group and the rVTT-gagpol immunization group. two independent experiments were conducted with similar results. one set of results is shown. recombinant vaccinia virus with S protein from SARS-CoV induced 20\u2013100 times the level of Nab in serum than that induced by rMVA. in vitro experiments showed that rVTT-gagpol could infect polarized Caco-2 epithelial layers and that progeny virus and expressed p24 were released mainly from the apical surface. the integrity of the cell layers deteriorated 4\u201312 hours after infection. before the cell layers broke down, p24 and vaccinia virus were still released from the apical surface. rVTT-gagpol was able to infect respiratory systems, though no viruses or p24 could be detected in the blood. study focused on the activity of luciferase in various mouse tissues after immunization with recombinant MVA through intranasal (i.n.), intravaginal (i.v.), and intrarectal (i.r.) routes. activity was not detected in the rectum, rectal lymph node, or other tissues. activity in the vagina lumen was not tested. in vitro, the 3-m pore in the transwell membrane was used to make sure that rVTT was released only from the basolateral surface. the release of p24 antigen was not significantly different. this implies that due to the large size of the vaccinia virus, it passed through 3-m transwell pores more easily than through 0.4-m pores. in mice, colchicine treatment increased viral infection and expression of p24 in the nose, nasal washes, and lamina colchicine can act as an immune suppressor at high doses (100 g/ml) and an immune enhancer at low doses (0.5\u20131 g/ml) colchicine can increase immune responses when co-administered with antigens. rVTT-gagpol can infect epithelial cells to express p24. progeny virus and p24 are released from the apical surface. colchicine was used to depolarize distribution. this facilitated antigen expression, delivery, and specific immune responses."}
