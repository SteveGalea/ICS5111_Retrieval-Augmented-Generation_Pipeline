{"summary": "-herpesvirus Herpes simplex virus type I (HSV-1) is largely responsible for outbreaks of vesicular oral skin lesions (fever blisters, or cold sores) it can also cause a variety of more severe diseases including encephalitis, meningitis and keratitis. the frequency of association with genital lesions (previously associated with HSV-2 infection) is increasing. the overlap between the results of these studies is generally very low [19], reflecting either differences in biology, or different experimental set-ups, cutoff and selection criteria. protein interaction studies can provide insight into the mechanism of action by identifying physical interaction partners between pathogen and host. genome-scale virus-host interaction screens using the yeast-two-hybrid system. HFs functionally influencing HSV-1 replication were performed in parallel with a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) protein interaction screen to gain insight into potential mechanisms of action. a subunit of the Mediator multi-protein complex, Med23, as a key regulator of IFN- induction, appears to be of crucial significance for the control of HSV-1 both in vitro and in vivo. siRNAs found to be cytotoxic were excluded from further analyses. a hitlist of 358 containing the top 2.5% inhibitory and the top 2.5% enhancing HFs was generated. the identified HSV-1 HFs were compared to datasets from published siRNA depletion screens. a genome-scale yeast two-hybrid protein interaction screen identifies novel viral protein interaction partners HSV-1 is currently known to encode at least 84 proteins. a genome-scale yeast two-hybrid protein interaction screen identifies novel viral protein interaction partners HSV-1 is currently known to encode at least 84 proteins. a direct comparison of HSV-1 protein interaction partners and the siRNA screen HFs found 215 genes in common. of those, ten (4.6%) were identified as a hit in both screens. this suggests these technologies identify complimentary yet not necessarily overlapping HFs. no of the three proteins which enhanced HSV-1 replication had an effect on either VZV or CMV. one (NR3C2) was even inhibitory for SFV. some functional groups (transcriptional regulators) were required by most viruses. phenotype was considered validated if 2 siRNAs produced the same or better phenotype as the primary screen. effect of HF siRNA SMARTpools on the replication of VZV (-herpesvirus), hCMV (-herpesvirus) or semliki forest virus (RNA virus) was determined and compared to HSV-1. several dynein chain subunits were found to be essential for virus replication. the moderate effect of depletion of other subunits demonstrated a level of functional redundancy in HSV-1 capsid transport. the immediate-early viral protein ICP0, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is crucial for blocking anti-viral defense mechanisms. several Mediator subunits (Med25, 29, 17 and 8) are known to interact with the HSV-1 transactivator VP16 (UL48) and other herpesviral proteins [41]. depletion of the majority of subunits (Med 4, 6, 7, 8, 14, 16, 17, 21, 25, 26, 27 and 28) led to a severe reduction in virus replication in the primary screen. deconvoluted siRNAs confirm role of Mediator subunits in HSV-1 replication. effect of four individual siRNAs (1\u20134) and a reconstituted SMARTpool (SP) on a range of subunits of the Mediator complex were compared to the primary screen. we first tested whether Med23 directly affects viral gene expression using luciferase reporters with HSV-1 promoters, however observed no inhibitory effect. depletion of Med23 enhanced replication and over-expression inhibited virus growth. in the parental A549 cells HSV-1 replication was unaffected by both depletion and over-expression of Med23. pCR3 or Med23 were overexpressed in A549 cells and induction of type I (IFN-) and type III (IFN-1, IFN-2/3) was measured by qRT-PCR. p-value 0.003; ** = p-value 0.002 (unpaired t-tests for unequal) a range of cell types were transfected with pCR3 or Med23. supernatant harvested 120 h post-transfection and IFN-3 levels measured by ELISA. expression was normalized as above and calibrated to RSCF-transfected cells at 0 h post-infection. induction of IFN-1 and 2/3 was significantly and statistically significantly higher. levels of other cytokines and interferon-regulatory factors were unaffected by Med23 overexpression. qPCR analysis found depletion of Med23 inhibited the induction of IFN- expression following HSV-1 infection of A549 cells. in a luciferase reporter assay, neither IRF4 nor IRF9 led to a significant induction of the IFN-1 promoter, either alone or in conjunction with Med23. IRF7 induced expression from the IFN- and IFN-1 promoters to similar levels (7-fold and 9-fold higher than background, respectively), while the ISRE, induced by IRF7 and also present in the IRF7 promoter, was induced 15-fold (Figure 5b a549 cells were transfected with IFN-1-, IFN-- or ISRE-responsive luciferase reporter constructs with IRF7 alone or in addition to Med23. the synergistic increase in IFN- induction by Med23 with IRF7 over IFN- induction was determined by unpaired t-tests for unequal variances. we screened a subset of the recurrent herpes labialis (HL) cohort. the association of a CT or TT genotype with the most severe recurrence of herpes labialis (H+) was statistically significant (p = 0.014; Fishers' exact t-test) n b Genderc n b Age range Median age CC CT TT NR 21 M 5 26\u201349 39 4 1 0 F 16 27\u201352 36 10 5 1 L 18 M 6 22\u201361 43 4 1 1 F 12 23\u201360 37 8 2 2 H 9 M 2 37\u201352 44.5 2 0 0 F 7 31\u201354 42 1 4 2 H+ 9 M 3 35\u201346 35 1 1 1 1 F 5 25\u201355 38 0 3 2 a SN the use of HSV-1 in a combined genome-scale screening approach has led to the identification of a regulatory axis in anti-viral innate immunity. this important finding highlights the power of such combined genome-scale screening approaches to identify novel host candidates for anti-herpesvirus drug discovery. the screen was carried out three times in triplicate, with one replicate used in a cell viability assay to determine any cytotoxic effects of gene depletion. siRNAs found to be cytotoxic (81 in total) excluded from further analyses. hitlist of 358 containing top 2.5% inhibitory and top 2.5% enhancing HFs was generated. identified HSV-1 HFs were compared to datasets from published siRNA depletion screens. a genome-scale yeast two-hybrid protein interaction screen identifies novel viral protein interaction partners HSV-1 is currently known to encode at least 84 proteins. a genome-scale yeast two-hybrid protein interaction screen identifies novel viral protein interaction partners HSV-1 is currently known to encode at least 84 proteins, expressed sequentially during infection. a direct comparison of HSV-1 protein interaction partners and the siRNA screen HFs found 215 genes in common. ten (4.6%) were identified as a hit in both screens. the overlap between the high-confidence Y2H cellular interactors (63) and HFs (358) was statistically significant. none of the three proteins which enhanced HSV-1 replication had an effect on either VZV or CMV. one (NR3C2) was even inhibitory for SFV. some functional groups (transcriptional regulators) were required by most viruses. phenotype was considered validated if 2 siRNAs produced the same or better phenotype as the primary screen. effect of HF siRNA SMARTpools on the replication of VZV (-herpesvirus), hCMV (-herpesvirus) or semliki forest virus (RNA virus) was determined and compared to HSV-1. several dynein chain subunits were found to be essential for virus replication. the moderate effect of depletion of other viral subunits demonstrated a level of functional redundancy in HSV-1 capsid transport. the immediate-early viral protein ICP0, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is crucial for blocking anti-viral defense mechanisms. several Mediator subunits (Med25, 29, 17 and 8) are known to interact with the HSV-1 transactivator VP16 (UL48) and other herpesviral proteins. depletion of the majority of subunits (Med 4, 6, 7, 8, 14, 16, 17, 21, 25, 26, 26, 27 and 28) led to a severe reduction in virus replication in the primary screen. deconvoluted siRNAs confirm role of Mediator subunits in HSV-1 replication. effect of four individual siRNAs (1\u20134) and a reconstituted SMARTpool (SP) on a range of subunits of the Mediator complex were compared to the primary screen (P) MARTPool and infected with HSV-1, Varicella zoster virus (VZV), human cytomegalovirus (hCMV), vacia virus (VacV) or SFV.
