{"summary": "a major factor in the host range of a coronavirus is its receptor utilization on host cells. fAPN serves as a functional receptor for most group 1 coronaviruses including feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), canine coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E). the family of Coronaviridae is composed of group 1\u20133 coronaviruses. these viruses are able to infect human, canine, feline, murine, bovine, porcine, rat, and avian species. the etiological importance and zoonotic characteristics of coronaviruses have received much attention. group 1 coVs include human coronavirus-229E (HCoV-229E), feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and canine coronavirus (CCV) use human, feline, porcine, and canine aminopeptidase N (APN) as functional receptors during virus entry. feline APN (fAPN) was reported to allow entry of the IBV strain Arkansas 99 (IBV_Ark99) in the effort to identify the receptor for group 3 coVs. this could therefore be the first indication of a more universal receptor for the coV family. we cultured seven strains of IBV, including Arkansas 99, Arkansas_DPI, California 99, California 99, Connecticut 46, Holland 52, Iowa 97, and Massachusetts 41. fAPN is not a functional receptor during IBV entry. fAPN expression frequency was determined by counting 300 cells. fAPN expression rescues FIPV-1146 and TGEV infection in non-permissive BHK-21 cells. monolayers were labeled with rabbit polyclonal antibody 367. fAPN/pcDNA3.1D/TOPO cells were separately infected with TGEV. viral infectivity was determined by counting >300 cells in three experiments. transfected and fAPN-transfected BHK-21 cells failed to show any detectable infection with IBV_Mass41. primary CK cells were efficiently infected. fAPN is not a functional receptor for field strains of IBV. cells were infected with IBV strains Ark99, Ark_DPI, CA99, and Iowa97 for 12 h. s were labeled with monoclonal -S1 or M (15:88, 13:18, or 9:19) antibodies to detect and determine viral infections. the ability to recognize sialic acids that are ubiquitously present on the cell surface gives influenza viruses the ability to infect varied tissue or cell types. retroviruses require more specialized receptor interactions between viral glycoprotein 120 (gp120) and CD4 as well as other chemokine receptors on the T-helper lymphocytes IBV_Ark99 viruses were able to infect BHK-21 cells to a limited degree (0.01%), although the infection profile was not always consistent among samples. previous studies may have shown only localized and under-represented populations of cells infected by IBV_Ark99. IBV_Mass41 infects CKC but not chick embryo fibroblast cells or the chicken DF-1 fibroblast cell line. this suggests possible cell type or tissue specificity for IBV infection. the use of a feline receptor for IBV could be another example of coronaviruses using feline cells as an interspecies reservoir to cross species boundaries. 97, H52, and Mass41 were obtained from Dr. Benjamin Lucio-Martinez, Unit of Avian Health, Cornell University. IBV Ark99 and CA99 were obtained from Dr. Shankar P. Mondal, University of Georgia. titer stocks were able to infect between 50% and 70% of the CK cells present. buffer saline (PBS) twice via gentle stirring to remove red blood cells. cells were then treated with 25 ml of trypsin-EDTA (Cellgro) for two minutes to separate large chunks of kidney tissues. anti-S1 monoclonal antibody 15:88 was used for IBV Massachusetts 41 and Iowa 97. the anti-M monoclonal antibody 13:18 was used for IBV Arkansas_DPI. FIPV-1146 and TGEV were obtained from Dr. Edward J. Dubovi, Animal Health Diagnostic Center, Cornell University. BHK-21 cells were purchased from ATCC and propagated twice weekly in DMEM, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) 1% penicillin-streptomycin and 10 mM HEPES (Cellgro) fAPN/pcDNA3.1D/TOPO and hAPN/pCiNeo plasmid DNAs were provided by Dr. Kathryn V. Holmes. cell monolayers were transfected at 37\u00b0C for 24 hours before fixation or virus infection. Molecular Probes purchased bit IgG from Molecular Probes. cell nuclei were counter-stained with Hoechst 33258 (Molecular Probes)"}
