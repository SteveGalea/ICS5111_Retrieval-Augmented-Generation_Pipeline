{"summary": "negative controls consisted of complete feed samples in meal form with 100 L of 105 TCID50 ASFV. negative controls consisted of complete feed samples in meal form with 100 L of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) added. supernatant from each sample was stored at 80\u00b0C. we collected porcine alveolar macrophages for virus isolation by lung lavage. cells were washed again and RPMI medium replaced. environmental conditions during the course of the trans-Atlantic model were a mean + SD temperature of 12.3 4.7\u00b0C (range 0\u201326\u00b0C) and a mean + SD humidity of 74.1% 19.2% (range 20%\u2013100%) negative control samples remained negative. all ASFV-inoculated samples showed detectable quantities of infectious ASFV. Mean TCID50 of ASFV Georgia 2007 quantified on porcine alveolar macrophages at 1, 8, 17 and 30 days after contamination for different types of feed and controls. feed ingredients were inoculated with 105 TCID50 ASFV based on previous half-life calculations. samples subjected to temperature (mean 12.3\u00b0C) and relative humidity (mean 74.1%) conditions in an environmental chamber programed to simulate transoceanic shipment. complete feed samples were in meal form."}
