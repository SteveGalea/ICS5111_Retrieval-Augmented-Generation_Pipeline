{"summary": "316 bats from 21 different species were captured from eight locations in southern Guatemala in two consecutive years. all three were collected from little yellow-shouldered bats (Sturnira lilium, family Phyllostomidae), a frugivorous bat that is abundant throughout Central and South America. the viral genomic sequences from bats GU09-153 and GU09-164 were determined by two next-generation sequencing approaches. the genomes from bats GU09-153 and GU09-164 were nearly identical to each other (99.99% nucleotide identity) two (matrix (M) and nonstructural (NS) contain an additional reading frame for expression of the M2 and the NS2/NEP protein homologs. the coding region of each genomic RNA segment (vRNA) is flanked by noncoding regions (NCR) at the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends that include sequences conserved among most segments. the bat virus genomes are most closely related structurally to influenza A viruses. HA and NA proteins from A/bat/Guat/09 and those of known influenza A viruses were aligned and compared. HA and NA proteins from A/bat/Guat/09 were aligned and compared. gaps in alignment are indicated with red triangles. labels are as in A, except that green pins represent residues involved in sialidase catalytic activity. HA and NA proteins of influenza viruses serve critical biological functions. the alignment and phylogenetic analysis of the bat viruses included a representative sample comprising 66 known influenza A viruses, six influenza B viruses, and one influenza C virus. analysis of the eight gene segments using maximum-likelihood methods (Fig. 3 A\u2013H) and Bayesian inferences (SI Appendix, Fig. S3 A\u2013H) showed three distinctive types of relationships between genes of A/bat/Guat/09 and the known influenza viruses. 2, PB1, PA, NP, and NS of A/bat/Guat/09 were clustered outside the influenza A and B gene branches. positions in the phylogenetic tree were between the influenza A and B split but were related more closely to the type A viral genes. phylogenetic trees of the eight gene segments of the bat virus genomes were inferred by the maximum-likelihood method. the amount of luciferase expression indicates the degree of compatibility of the NCR with the polymerase complex. luciferase expression indicates the degree of compatibility of the NCR with the polymerase complex and with cellular components required for efficient expression. a complete necropsy was performed on all bats in compliance with approved field protocols. samples included blood, major organs (liver, intestine, lung, and kidney) and rectal and oral swabs. amplicons of the eight viral segments from two bats were subcloned into the pCR-XL-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) the 3\u2032 end and 5\u2032 end sequences of each segment from two bats were determined using the 5\u2032/3\u2032 RACE kit (Roche) negative controls without template were run on each plate using nuclease-free water. a sample was considered positive when more than one reaction was positive. sequences of influenza A and B viruses were downloaded from the global initiative on sharing Avian Influenza Data database. ids expressing viral PB2, PB1, PA, and NP from the strain of interest (23) cell lysates were harvested and further diluted to perform a dual luciferase assay."}
