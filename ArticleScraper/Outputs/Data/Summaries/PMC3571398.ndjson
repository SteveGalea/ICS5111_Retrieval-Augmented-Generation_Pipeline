{"summary": "as of 10 august 2012, 608 human cases have been confirmed. a mortality rate of almost 60% has been confirmed. many viral determinants for pathogenicity of H5N1 viruses have been identified. the HA gene is associated with virulence and tissue tropism in mammals (12\u201314) other gene segments, such as NS and M genes, are also implicated in the high virulence of H5N1 AIVs in mammals (15\u201317) CK10 was isolated from a dead chicken, and GS10 was isolated from an apparently healthy goose in a domestic live bird market. phylogenetic and genetic properties of these two viruses have been described previously (24). image data were processed using an Agilent microarray scanner with default settings. the software was used to perform image analysis and to apply a universal error model. the most conservative error model was applied. RNA was extracted and each viral gene segment was sequenced to ensure the absence of unwanted mutations. supernatants were collected at 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h p.i. 293T cells were infected with CK10, GS10, CK-PA353I, and GS-PA353R at an MOI of 2. at 4 and 8 h p.i., cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fractionated for extraction of the nuclear and cytoplasmic protein. quantitative real-time PCR was used to validate changes in gene expression found in microarray analysis and expression profiles of representative cytokine genes in mouse lungs. total RNA was isolated from tissues using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and treated with DNase I (Fermentas, Glen Burnie, MD) a 1-g volume of total RNA per sample was reverse transcribed into cDNA using 400 U RevertAid Premium reverse transcript mice were infected intranasally with serial dilutions of virus. mice were inoculated with 106.0 EID50 of each virus. mice were euthanized and the heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidneys, and brain were collected. the threshold of detection was 101.0 EID50/ml. Statistical analyses were performed using an independent-sample t test. all primary expression microarray data have been deposited in the gene expression Omnibus database. labeled cRNAs were purified by an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, GmBH, Germany) each slide was hybridized with 1.65 g Cy3-labeled cRNA using a gene expression hybridization kit (Agilent Technologies) in a hybridization oven (Agilent Technologies), according to the manufacturer's instructions. genes of CK10 and GS10 were amplified and cloned into plasmid vector pHW2000 (25, 26) primers of each gene segment are listed in Table S3 in the supplemental material. a mixture of 293T and MDCK cells was transfected with plasmids encoding all eight influenza virus genes using polyFect transfection reagent. 293T cells were transfected with 200 ng of pcDNA3.1-PB2, pcDNA3.1-PB1, pcDNA3.1-PA, pcDNA3.1-NP, and luciferase reporter plasmid p-Luci (Promega, Madison, WI) and 20 ng of internal control plasmid Renilla (Promega) using polyFect transfection reagent (Qiagen) after 24 h, cell the blots were washed three times for 10 min each in TBST buffer. they were then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with the primary monoclonal antibody against NP (Santa Cruz, CA) a mouse monoclonal -actin antibody was used as an internal standard. PCRs were performed in triplicate using an ABI Prism 7300 system. 1 cycle at 50\u00b0C for 2 min and 1 cycle at 95\u00b0C for 5 s followed by 40 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 5 s and 60\u00b0C for 31 s. three mice from each group were euthanized and the heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidneys, and brain were collected for virus titration in eggs. for quantification of cytokine gene expression in the lung, mice were inoculated with 105.0 EID50. CK10 replicated to significantly higher titers than did GS10. survival rate showed that mice infected with CK10 all died by day 8 p.i. no death was found in GS10-infected mice in a period of 14 days. CK10 induces a robust host response in the lung by microarray analysis. a total of 1,359 genes were observed with significantly differential levels of expression (P 0.05 and fold change > 2) during CK10 infection. only 58 genes were common to these two viruses. top 10 IPA canonical pathways modulated by CK10 and GS10 Virus IPA canonical pathwaya P value Gene countb CK10 Role of pattern recognition receptors in recognition of bacteria and viruses 4.62E-14 23/106 Activation of IRF by cytosolic pattern recognition receptors 6.21E-11 15/72 Role of hypercytokinemia/hyperchemokinemia in the pathogenesis of influenza 1.01E-08 10/44 Atherosclerosis signaling 5. the most significant canonical pathways associated with CK10 and GS10 infection are listed in Table 1. the most significant canonical pathways associated with CK10 and GS10 infection are listed in Table 1. a mild type I response was observed in GS10-infected mice. a mild type I response was observed in GS10-infected mice. we also analyzed expression levels of the selected cytokine genes. this robust inflammatory response correlates with the infiltration of inflammatory cells in the lungs during CK10 infection. r-CK10-inoculated mice, whereas r-GS10 replicated only in the lung, indicating that the rescued viruses maintained genuine biological properties of the wild-type viruses. genes derived from CK10 virus are in red, and those derived from GS10 virus are in green.

(dpi) recombinant viruses derived from the GS10 backbone showed higher virulence than the parent virus. recombinant viruses derived from the CK10 backbone showed higher virulence than the parent virus and spread to multiple organs similarly to CK10 on day 5 p.i. CK-GS (PA plus NP) and CK-GS (PA plus HA) were also impaired, as evidenced by the failure of these two viruses to invade the heart and kidneys. the PA, HA, and NP genes contribute to the high virulence of CK10 in mice. six-week-old female BALB/c mice were inoculated intranasally with 106.0 EID50 of each virus. three mice from each group were killed on day 5 p.i. for virus titration in eggs. no virus was isolated from the sample. c P 0.01 compared with the titers in the corresponding organs of the r-GS10-infected mice. d P 0.01 compared with the titers in the corresponding organs of the r-CK10-infected mice. CK10 and GS10 have differences of eight amino acids in the PA gene. mutant GS10 carrying double mutations (I353R plus T404A) showed virulence similar to the level seen for that containing a single I353R mutation (MLD50: 104.6 EID50) simultaneous mutations of PA 353 and PA 404 have no significant synergic effect on virulence change. different cells were inoculated at a multiplicity of infection of 0.01. Virus titers were determined in MDCK cells at appropriate time points. activity of the r-CK10 RNP complex was 6.2-fold higher than that of r-GS10. activity of the r-CK10 RNP complex was decreased 10-, 4-, or 4.2-fold. plasmids expressing PB2, PB1, PA, and NP from CK10 or GS10 viruses were used to measure firefly and Renilla luciferase activities. the value of each recombinant virus was compared with that of the corresponding parental virus. GS-CKPA virus appeared to be the most potent cytokine inducer. CK10 containing GS10 HA retained the high-cytokine phenotype compared to CK10. the PA and NP genes are both essential for cytokine hyperinduction. CK10 viruses containing genes of CK10 or carrying the PA-I353R mutation in the GS10 background replicated to higher titers in the lung than did GS10. however, expression of the PA gene (or PA-I353R) between CK10 and GS10 largely resulted in the transfer of viral replication in the lung. CK10 was highly pathogenic in mice (mouse 50% lethal dose [MLD50], 0.33 log10 EID50), whereas GS10 was nonpathogenic (MLD50 > 6.32 log10 EID50). survival rate showed that mice infected with CK10 all died by day 8 p.i. CK10 induces a robust host response in the lung by microarray analysis. a total of 1,359 genes were observed with significantly differential levels of expression. CK10 preferred to regulate immune response pathways, while GS10 tended to modulate metabolism pathways associated with cell cycle and cellular function and maintenance.

CK10-infected mice mounted a transcriptional cytokine storm upon virus infection. expression levels of IFNs and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) were markedly increased. a mild type I response was observed in GS10-infected mice. r-CK10-infected mice showed no disease signs, even at a high dose of 106.0 EID50. systemic replication was found in the r-CK10-inoculated mice. r-GS10 replicated only in the lung, indicating that the rescued viruses maintained genuine biological properties of the wild-type viruses. r-GS10 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 GS-CKPB2 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 CK-GSPB2 2.0 1.0 3.6 1.2 2.1 0.3 3.5 0.2 6.0 0.5 7.0 0.4 2.6 0.3 3.0 0.6 2.9 0.2 4.6 0.2 2.2 0.8 3.2 0.8 CK-GSPB1 2.6 1.3 3.0 0.7 2.4 0.1 3.5 0.1 6.4 0.2d 2.5 0.07 4.3 0.6 2.1 0.9 4.7 0.8 2.5 0.0 3.8 0.4 CK-GSPA \u2014 2.6 0.2 six-week-old female BALB/c mice were intranasally inoculated with 106.0 EID50 of each virus. three mice from each group were killed 3 and 5 days p.i. (dpi) the PA, HA, and NP genes of CK10 increased the virulence of GS10, with MLD50 values of 2.9, 5.0, and 5.1 log10 EID50 respectively. recombinant viruses derived from the GS10 backbone showed higher virulence than the parent viruses. recombinant viruses derived from the CK10 backbone showed a dramatic decrease in virulence in mice compared to the parental virus. expression of the PA, HA, and NP genes of GS10 together in CK10 confined virus replication only to the lung. the dissemination capacity of CK-GS (PA plus NP) and CK-GS (PA plus HA) was also impaired. 4.7 0.3e 2.1 0.8 1.0 0.5e 1.3 0.5e 5.7 CK-GS(PA + HA + NP) \u2014 4.2 0.4e \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 6.3 GS-PA101G \u2014 \u2014 4.4 0.4 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 >6.5 GS-PA127V \u2014 \u2014 4.5 0.4 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 >6.5 GS-PA237E \u2014 \u2014 4.3 0.1 \u2014 \u2014 > three mice from each group were killed on day 5 p.i. for virus titration in eggs. no virus was isolated from the sample. PA-I353R increases the virulence of GS10 virus. CK-PA353I virus failed to replicate in the kidneys and liver. CK-PA404T retained the tissue tropism of the CK10. virulence was decreased with a MLD50 of 104.4 EID50. we did not observe the advantage of GS-PA404A replication in these cells compared with r-GS10. these results showed that PA 353R largely determined the growth advantage of CK10 in vitro, correlating with its high replication efficacy in vivo. 293T cells were transfected with luciferase reporter plasmid p-Luci and internal control plasmid Renilla. plasmids expressing PB2, PB1, PA, and NP from CK10 or GS10 viruses. value of each recombinant virus was compared with that of the parental virus. recombinant viruses carrying genes from CK10 or PA-I353R in the GS10 background induced significantly higher levels of cytokine gene expression than did GS10. in parallel, exchange of the PA or NP gene of CK10 with that of GS10 led to attenuated cytokine induction, and the NP gene had a prominent function. open bars represent data for recombinant virus in the GS10 background. data represent the mean fold changes standard errors of the means. there was a positive correlation between viral titers and cytokine levels. three mice of each group were euthanized at 8, 24, and 72 h p.i. mice were euthanized at 8, 24, and 72 h p.i., and mouse lung, brain, and spleen tissues were collected for viral titration in eggs. the detection limit was 101.0 EID50/ml. CK10 greatly influenced the early host innate immune response in the lung. CK10 caused intense expression of proinflammatory cytokine genes. IL-6 is reported to act as a key mediator of acute lung injury in mice. similar findings were obtained from studies of the pathogenesis of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 viruses (19, 20) in these studies, viruses of different genetic backgrounds were compared and the differences in the host response are likely associated with the viral genetic background. in this study, two H5N1 strains with similar genetic backgrounds exhibited heterogeneity. an amino acid 353 of the PA gene makes the nonlethal GS10 virus pathogenic in mice. some previous studies have demonstrated the involvement of the PA gene in the pathogenicity of AIVs in mammals (38\u201342) the PA gene contains a second ORF (X-ORF) whose N-terminal 191 amino acids are derived from the PA ORF. the C-terminal sequence (positions 190 to 253 of the PA gene) is derived from the +1-frameshifted X-ORF (11) this ORF produces a fusion protein, denoted PA-X, which functions to repress cellular gene expression and modulates the virulence of IAV in mice. the polymorphism at position 237 might affect the X sequence and act in concert with position 353 in determining virulence of AIVs in mammals. the majority of H5N1 strains (2010 to 2011) in our laboratory containing 353R in the PA gene (clade 2.3.2.1) are lethal to mice. this results indicate that viruses harboring 353R in the PA gene may obtain a survival advantage in nature. infected mouse organs were lower than in those of GS-CKPA-infected mice. NP is a structural RNA binding protein involved in viral replication. it also functions as a key adapter molecule in the process of interaction between virus and host. reassortment plays a major role in the emergence of novel influenza viruses. the past pandemics of influenza in humans in the 20th century proved the disaster that was brought by reassortment. phenotypes could be transferred between CK10 and GS10 via the reciprocal substitution at position 353 in the PA or the exchange of the entire PA gene. this could result in the transfer of the contrasting virus pathogenicity."}
