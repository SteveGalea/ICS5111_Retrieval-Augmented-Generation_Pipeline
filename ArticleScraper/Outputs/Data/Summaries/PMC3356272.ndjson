{"summary": "the genus flavivirus (family Flaviviridae) comprises several pathogens, including dengue virus (DENV), yellow fever virus (YFV), west Nile virus (WNV), tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) the virus is transmitted to humans by bites of mosquitoes or ticks. glycopeptide antibiotics (i.e. teicoplanin, eremomycin and vancomycin) are used for the treatment of gram-positive bacterial infections. synthetically modified glycopeptide antibiotics (SGPAs) have been reported to be endowed with in vitro antiviral activity against retro- and corona viruses. LCTA-949 inhibited the replication of the tick-borne encephalitis virus (EC50: 0.3 M), the west Nile virus (EC50: 13 M), the Japanese encephalitis virus (EC50: 4.3 M), and the murine flavivirus Modoc virus (EC50: 9.2 M) LCTA-949 inhibited the replication of the tick-borne encephalitis virus (EC50: 0.3 M), the west Nile virus (EC50: 13 M), deNV-2 E protein and YFV-17D NS1 protein expression was visualized on day 3 p.i. Figure 3. Dose-dependent inhibition of flavivirus replication by LCTA-949 and ribavirin. LCTA-949 failed to efficiently inhibit DENV infection when added 2 h or later after infection. most of the protective activity of LCTA-949 was already lost when LCTA-949 (10 M) was added to infected cultures 20 min p.i. or later. LCTA-949 exerts its antiviral activity by targeting (one of the) structural proteins. this indicates that LCTA-949 exerts its antiviral activity by targeting (one of the) structural proteins. this indicates that LCTA-949 exerts its antiviral activity by targeting (one of the) structural proteins. this indicates that LCTA-949 exerts its antiviral activity by targeting (one of the) structural proteins. LCTA-949 markedly reduced the number of bound virus particles to cells in a dose-dependent manner. at a concentration of 25 M, LCTA-949 inhibited virus-cell binding by 80%. LCTA-949 acts by preventing virus-cell binding by 80%. no treatment, NH4Cl (50 mM), chlorpromazine (60 M) and LCTA-949 treatment are shown. LCTA-949 interferes with antibody-dependent enhancement of DENV infection. LCTA-949 inhibits DENV-2-induced CPE formation in a dose-dependent manner. LCTA-949 inhibits DENV-2-induced CPE formation in a dose-dependent manner. LCTA-949 inhibited the replication of the tick-borne encephalitis virus (EC50: 0.3 M), the west Nile virus (EC50: 13 M), the Japanese encephalitis virus (EC50: 4.3 M), and the murine flavivirus Modoc virus (EC50: 9.2 M) cell viability was determined by the MTS/PMS method (lines) data represent mean values standard deviations (SD) for three independent experiments. LCTA-949 inhibits an early event in the replication cycle. LCTA-949 [10 M] was added to DEN reporter virus (A, circles) or YFV-17D-infected cultures at 2-h intervals starting 2 hours before infection. the luciferase activity (DEN reporter virus) or the intracellular viral RNA content (YFV-17D) was measured at 24 hours p.i. the data represent mean values SD for 2 independent experiments. LCTA-949 did not inhibit replication of the DENV subgenomic replicon. this indicates that LCTA-949 exerts its antiviral activity by targeting (one of the) structural proteins. this indicates that LCTA-949 exerts its antiviral activity by targeting (one of the) structural proteins. this indicates that LCTA-949 exerts its antiviral activity by targeting (one of the) structural proteins. relative extent of virus fusion was estimated by measuring the total fluorescent signal per imaging field. LCTA-949 markedly impaired membrane fusion activity of DENV. this effect can likely be ascribed to the low binding efficiency of virions to cells in presence of LCTA-949. 0.2% of cells were infected with DENV in the absence of mAbs. in presence of enhancing concentrations of anti-E mAb DV2-104 62.8% were infected with DENV. effect of two other anti-E mAbs, DV2-48 or DV2-96 mapped to E domain I/II and to E domain III [12], respectively, were evaluated. each step can potentially serve as a target for inhibition of the virus life cycle. the DENV E protein represents an attractive target to inhibit DENV entry. polyanionic substances and plant lectins have been shown to be capable of inhibiting the first step of the flavivirus replication cycle. time-of-drug-addition studies revealed that the compound exerts its antiviral activity at the time of infection and inhibits binding of the virus to the host cell. LCTA-949 (in contrast to the replication inhibitor ribavirin) has no effect on subgenomic replicon replication and therefore does not inhibit the intracellular replication machinery of the virus. LCTA-949 elicited the highest antiviral activity against the TBEV. of all flaviviruses studied, LCTA-949 proved the least active against WNV. however, so far we have not been able to select for drug-resistant variants. LCTA-949 also interferes with antibody-mediated cell entry of DENV particles. ADE is thought to play a pivotal role in the exacerbation of DENV-induced disease during a secondary infection (DHF or DSS) LCTA-949 was added to preformed virus-antibody complexes and was also shown to result in an antiviral effect. BS-C-1 cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 in 1 high glucose, L-glutamine-enriched DMEM (PAA) with 10% FBS, penicillin (100 U/ml), and streptomycin (100 g/ml), and 1.0 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco) EM supplemented with 10% FBS (culture medium) or 2% FBS (assay medium) the dengue replicon construct pDENCprMEPAC2NS3lucNS3 was inserted upstream of the non-structural (NS) genes. 3.3 g/ml of puromycin was added to the culture medium. this virus is referred to as \"dengue reporter virus\" the batches of the viral inoculum (JEV, TBEV and WNV) were prepared by culturing virus twice on vero cells in MEM supplemented with 7% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine and penicillin-streptomycin. cell culture supernatants were collected and frozen at 80\u00b0C in 50 mM HEPES. antiviral assays for JEV, TBEV and WNV were carried out in vero-B cells in 24-well plates. cells were cultured in MEM supplemented with 7% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, and penicillin-streptomycin. quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (qRT-PCR) RNA was isolated from 150 l supernatant with the NucleoSpin RNA virus kit (Macherey-Nagel, Germany) as described by the manufacturer. RT-PCR was performed using the ABI 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Branchburg, NJ) cells were stained with the anti-dengue E protein antibody (Ab) clone 3H5 (Millipore, Billerica, MA) or the anti-YFV NS1 Ab 1A5 and the secondary Ab Alexa Fluor 488 (Millipore) after DAPI staining, the cultures were visualized using a confocal laser scanning microscope. using the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen) and YFV-17D RNA levels were quantified using RT-qPCR. a more elaborate assay was performed for YFV in which the compound was added to the cell cultures every 20 minutes beginning 60 minutes before infection. the next day, the cells were seeded in a 8-well chamber slide (Nunc) at a density of 2104 cells/well. virus was inactivated with 1 mg/ml proteinase K (Promega) after 1 hour, RNA was isolated from the samples. the virus was purified on a potassium-tartrate density gradient. 1010 GCPs of virus (equivalent to 108 PFUs) were mixed with 2 nmol DiD dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) the virus was filtered with a Sephadex G-50 Fine (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) column prepared in a glass pasteur pipette. microscopy analysis was done by taking 10 snapshots of randomly selected fields using both differential interference contrast (DIC) and DiD channels. DIC images were taken from each field to make sure the visualized DiD-particles are bound to a cell. the number of infected cells was determined using the anti-E monoclonal antibody MAB8702 (Millipore) for virus-antibody complex formation, virus particles were incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C with murine anti-E antibodies. the EC50 and EC90 were defined according to the percentage of infectivity inhibition relative to that of the positive control. mouse macrophage P388D1 cells maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin (100 U/ml), and streptomycin (100 g/ml), sodium bicarbonate (invitrogen, 7,5% solution) and 1.0 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco) at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2. puromycin was omitted from the culture medium in antiviral assays. the construction of an infectious, full-length dengue virus (DENV-2 16681) in which a Renilla luciferase expression cassette was inserted upstream of the 3\u2032 untranslated (3\u2032UTR) region. this virus is referred to as \u201cdengue reporter virus\u201d. a compound dilution series was added after which cultures were infected with 100 CCID50 (i.e., 50% cell culture infectious dose) deNV-2 NGC in 100 l assay medium. the cultures were fixed with 70% ethanol and stained with 1% methylene blue. one day after seeding, cells were infected with 100 l of the viral inoculum. cells were washed twice with HBSS after which 1 ml fresh medium supplemented or not with the compound was added to the wells.
