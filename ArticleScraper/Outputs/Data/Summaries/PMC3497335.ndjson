{"summary": "multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neuroinflammatory disease with unknown etiology and variable clinical evolution. many viruses have been suspected and studied in this regard, but so far no specific virus has been found to be the MS cause. FN-, copolymer and, more recently, natalizumab, monoclonal antibody (Moab) against a1b4 integrin, has significantly improved the life of many MS patients. but intrinsic therapeutic limitations and severe side effects associated with these drugs stimulate basic and clinical researchers to define innovative and patient-compliant treatment strategies. myelin basic protein (MBP) was cleaved into immune-dominant peptides by MMP-9. the REGA model contained much more information related to autoimmune diseases. it addressed the critical point that (unspecific) inflammatory reactions with myeloid cells may be primordial and a possible target in MS. the animals develop a disease process that closely resembles MS in humans. the animals are inbred to reliably produce susceptibility to EAE in the animals. increased levels of Th1 cytokines are particularly evident during relapse. increased Th2 cytokines are found during remission in relapsing/remitting MS patients. this is also observed in other Th1-type diseases. IL-17 is a novel cytokine homolog of the IL-6 subfamily. it forms a novel cytokine designated IL-23. IL-23, but not IL-12, is essential for the induction of EAE. nave CD4+ cells exposed to IL-6, TGF-, and IL-21 can develop into Th17 cells. IL-23 production plays a role in maintaining these Th17 cells. patients with MS have greater numbers of IL-17-mRNA-expressing mononuclear cells in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) the cytokine environment was converted from a disease-promoting IL-23-producing condition to a disease-limiting IL-4-producing condition by the local expression of IL-4 from a Herpes simplex virus vector delivered to the brain [55]. Moreover, the increased expression of IL-4 in glial cells was associated with the reduced EAE severity. the upregulation of Th2 cytokines inhibits the propagation of the EAE/MS inflammation promoted by Th17. IL-21 is a type I four-helix bundle cytokine that belongs to the IL-2 family. IL-21 plays a pivotal role in the expansion and differentiation of the Th17 lineage. IL-27 drives the expansion and differentiation of IL-10-producing Tregs by inducing the expression of three key molecules. ICOS also promotes IL-27-driven Tregs. the loss of c-MAF, IL-21 signaling, or ICOS reduces the frequency of IL-27-induced Treg differentiation. ICOS also promotes IL-27-driven Tregs. a novel effector T-cell subset, Th9 cells, has been identified. the ability of this T-cell subset to induce EAE is currently being investigated. the authors suggested that the different effector Th subsets that induce EAE do so differently.

IFN- also induces in B cells the IL-10 secretion which may mediate their regulatory potency. this may uncover extra mechanisms of the B-cell contribution to the autoimmune effects. mitoxantrone treatment in MS acts through the enhancement of Th2-type cytokines. fingolimod (FTY720/Gilenya, Novartis), an S1PR modulator, is under the spotlight. it is the first oral, first-line treatment for relapsing MS. cladribine reduces relapses by 55%\u201358% and has an impact on disability progression and all MRI outcome markers in patients with relaxing/remitting MS. however, to exactly weigh the benefits of both novel immunomodultory agents against the potential risks is necessary and must be monitored continuously. relapses and/or progression are attributable to multifocal brain and/or spinal cord inflammation. effector Th cells and correlated cytokines play a well-recognized role in the initiation of autoimmune tissue inflammation, and have an established association with the pathogenesis of this disorder. more immune-modulatory therapeutic agents are currently in clinical trials. fingolimod (FTY720, alemtuzumab, and rituximab add-on therapies) is currently in clinical trials."}
