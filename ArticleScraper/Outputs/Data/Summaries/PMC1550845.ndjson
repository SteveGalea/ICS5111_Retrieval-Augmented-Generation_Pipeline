{"summary": "the study defined 4,543 positive pneumonias, of which 2,221 were CAP, 988 HCAP, 853 HAP and 499 VAP. the results showed that patients with HCAP were slightly older than those with CAP but were broadly similar to those with HAP. a prospective trial randomised 369 patients who had required ventilation for more than 48 hours to receive treatment with either a heated humidifier or a heat and moisture exchanger during their stay. they showed no difference between the treatments in incidence of VAP. the optimal specimen collection technique for the diagnosis of VAP continues to be strongly debated. the study numbers are small, particularly given the all-cause inclusion criteria. the world recently seems to be an ever more dangerous place. there is a superbug near you \u2013 be quite sure of it \u2013 and it will probably try to kill you given half a chance. two recently published papers with an accompanying editorial address some of these issues. the work of Mcdonald et al. [7] consists of an impressively detailed microbiological survey of C. difficile outbreaks across six states in the united states. a group in Newcastle analysed mitochondrial DNA in 150 adult admissions to the intensive care unit with a diagnosis of severe sepsis. haplogroup H patients were 2.12 times more likely to be alive at 180 days. authors suggest mitochondrial DNA haplotyping offers new means of risk stratification in severe sepsis."}
