{"summary": "respiratory infections represent one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality across the world. they represent the deadliest communicable diseases causing 3.0 million deaths worldwide in 2016 [1]. respiratory infections have been identified as a mandatory topic in the education and training of respiratory physicians, but the specialty has been faced with several challenges to implement training. a modified Delphi technique was applied to these topics to reach consensus. the technique is a group facilitation method that seeks to obtain consensus on the opinions of experts.
