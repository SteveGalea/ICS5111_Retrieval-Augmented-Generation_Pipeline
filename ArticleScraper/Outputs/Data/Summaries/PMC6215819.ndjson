{"summary": "influenza viruses are segmented, negative-stranded enveloped RNA viruses that cause respiratory infections, fever, malaise, coughing, and mucus production. all A, B, and C can be infectious in humans with influenza A viruses (IAVs) causing the most widespread disease, influenza D virus is not known to infection humans (1, 2). seasonal influenza infections during the second and third trimester of gestation increase the morbidity of pregnant women with higher hospitalization rates than the general population and mortality (6). pregnant women typically represent 1% of the american population, but during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic they comprise 6.4% of all hospitalizations and 4.3% of all deaths (10, 11) the 1918 and 1957 pandemics produced similar clinical outcomes for pregnant women. modern diagnostic procedures employed during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic allow for more direct linkage between influenza viral infection of pregnant mothers and poor outcomes for maternal and neonatal health (9). maternal vaccination during the second or third trimester of pregnancy with seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine substantially reduced the incidence of ILI in both mothers and their newborns (19\u201321) hemagglutinin (HA), a surface protein on influenza virions, binds to 2,6-linked sialic acids that are widely expressed on the surface of ciliated airway epithelial cells. the HA protein is triggered to fuse viral and cellular membranes, releasing the viral genome into the cell (30\u201332) the eight negative-stranded RNA segments of the viral genome are then translocated to the nucleus. kines interferon- (IFN-) and interferon- (IFN-) (36, 37) secretion of cytokines activates epithelial cells to express antiviral genes that hamper viral entry and replication. additional cytokines expressed by activated airway epithelium and innate immune cells induce fever and mucus production. virus-specific CD103+ CD8+ tissue resident memory (TRM) cells in the lungs could provide rapid response upon the next infection. memory B cells persisted in the mediastinal lymph nodes to secrete virus-neutralizing antibody into circulation upon restimulation. research into the specific mechanisms of H1N1 influenza A virus binding, entry, RNA replication, transmission, and induction of the host immune system has been extensive since the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic. insufficient progesterone production has been associated with infertility and recurrent spontaneous abortions. variations in progesterone levels as a result of infectious disease are not well tolerated by maternal physiology. progesterone receptors are expressed broadly on most immune cell subsets. maternal and fetal sides of placenta are preventing intrauterine NK cell activation against fetal trophoblasts. the expression of IL-4 and IL-6 then promotes hCG secretion from the corpus luteum, which in turn releases more progesterone. recurrent miscarriage is associated with a predominance of Th1 memory cells in the endometrium (65) few pathogens can cross the placental barrier from the mother to the fetus. there is limited evidence that influenza A virus crosses the maternal-fetal barrier. there is limited evidence that influenza A virus crosses the maternal-fetal barrier. PBMCs isolated from healthy pregnant women had significantly reduced IFN- and IFN- responses. shift away from inflammatory Th1 cytokines (TNF-, IFN-, IL-2) can limit potential cytotoxic damage to the fetus and placenta. progesterone activates progesterone-induced binding factor (PIBF) in lymphocytes, which in turn promotes the synthesis of IL-3, IL-4, and IL-12. a single subset of cells may not depict the entire story of hormonal, cytokine and immune cell signaling between lung, fetus, and placenta in an infected pregnant woman. clinical samples from pregnant women are limited to blood, post-partum placenta, and post-mortem tissues. the effect of the hormonal millieu during pregnancy on innate immune responses is complicated. pregnant mice infected with a mouse-adapted, 2009 H1N1 influenza virus expressed elevated levels of IL-1, IL-6, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP-1), CXCL1 and RANTES. these cytokines were highly expressed in humans who died as a result of 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus (87, 89) mice have shown that pregnancy increases lung inflammation and expression of stress-induced prostaglandins (PGs) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) prior to infection. IAV infection enhances immunopathology in the lungs of pregnant mice relative to non-pregnant mice. gene encoding hypervariable Ig regions is broken by activation-induced deaminase (AID) and uracil-DNA glycosylase (UNG) the accumulating mutations may result in the generation of antibodies with an increased affinity to viral antigens (101, 102). Ultimately, most antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) will undergo apoptosis following viral clearance. estrogen has been shown to upregulate Bcl-2, inducing survival of autoreactive B cells. progesterone has been established as negative regulator of B cell lymphopoiesis. healthy pregnancy has been shown to suppress B cell lymphopoiesis in mice. pregnant women seroconverted at the same rate as non-pregnant women following TIV but generated lower geometric mean titers (GMTs) against H1N1 (A/California) and H3N2 (A/Perth) viruses. antibody isotype classes and generation of specificity are governed by the class-switching of Ig genes and somatic hypermutation of their variable chain-encoding regions (102, 121). Variability is induced primarily by activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) and uracil-DNA glycosylase (UNG) that selectively damage DNA and repair it randomly (102, 121, 122). B cells that have complementarity-determining regions (C maternal immune system may be able to mitigate negative effects of anti-fetal antibodies. physiology of influenza A virus infection and immune responses Human influenza A virus is typically transmitted through respiratory droplets and inhaled into the nasopharynx. people infected with 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus were contagious as early as 12 hours post-inoculation. the release of viral RNA within the cell activates innate immune signaling pathways, especially toll-like receptors (TLRs) and retinoic-acid-inducible gene 1 induce the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interferon- and interferon- (IFN-) nave B cells are primed by soluble antigen and costimulated by TFH cells to mature into plasmablasts that will then traffic to the site of the infection and secrete virus-specific neutralizing antibodies (46). Upon resolution of disease, alveolar macrophages clear cellular debris, and basal stem cells regenerate airway epithelium to restore healthy tissue (48, 49) a fertilized oocyte develops into a blastocyst and then the outer layer of the blastocyst forms a polarized structure called the trophectoderm (57) a fertilized oocyte develops into a blastocyst, and then the outer layer of the blastocyst forms a polarized structure called the trophectoderm (57) progesterone receptors are expressed broadly on most immune cell subsets. in the uterus, progesterone induces the transition of nave Th0 cells into IL-4, IL-5, and IL-6 secreting Th2 memory cells upon antigen recognition. progesterone also upregulates the activity of uterine Tregs. fetal placenta develops from the cells in the implanted blastocyst as it transitions into the trophoblast which differentiates into cytotrophoblasts and synciotrophoblasts. maternal blood makes direct contact with fetal cells allowing for gas, nutrient, and waste exchange. there is limited evidence that influenza A virus crosses the maternal-fetal barrier. poor fetal outcomes are likely due to indirect exposure to maternal inflammatory cytokine expression and dysregulation of pregnancy-supportive hormones. cytokines that make it across the placental syncytiotrophoblast layer into the fetal circulatory system do not cause inflammation or immune cell activation that interrupt fetal growth and development. hormone-mediated suppression of inflammatory cytokine production and cellular activation is critical to successful pregnancy in the short-term. proper inflammatory signals must be activated to recruit innate immune cells and CD8+ T cells in order to clear virus-infected tissue. placental transmission of inflammatory cytokines, dysregulated hormone signaling, and oxygen deprivation due to maternal respiratory distress have all been implicated. mice implanted with E2 exhibited reduced type I IFN signaling and impaired CD8+ T cell function. ovariectomized and E2-implanted female C57BL/6 mice infected with H1N1 PR8 influenza virus exhibited enhanced recruitment of neutrophils and virus-specific T cells. differences in genetic background have been shown to cause variability in viral pathogenesis, inflammatory cytokine response, pulmonary microRNA expression, alveolar macrophage viability. soluble viral antigen released from infected cells primes naive B cells in the lungs. clonal proliferation and amplification of antibodies specific for influenza viral antigens (46) is required to activate B cells with highest affinity for the viral antigen. only small percentage of high-specificity B cell clones will become plasma cells that secrete low levels of antibody into the serum. clinical evidence has long documented that the symptoms of autoimmune diseases tend to recede during pregnancy and resurge after parturition and breastfeeding. the development of autoimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus have been linked to the effects of estrogen on B cell activation and function. studies of seasonal trivalent inactivated influenza vaccination in Bangladesh showed improved transplacental transfer of influenza-specific antibodies from mother to child. however, there are mixed results in how pregnancy affects humoral immunity following vaccination. pregnant women seroconverted at the same rate as non-pregnant women following TIV. yang, china produced an imbalanced proportion of anti-H1N1 IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4 antibody subtypes compared with non-pregnant women in the same hospital. this phenomenon has not been directly linked to influenza infection and vaccination. asymmetric glycosylation, or single glycosylation of one side rather than both sides of the Fab or Fc antibody chains, can result in fine-tuned interactions with antigen and Fc receptors. pregnancy has been shown to increase serum and placental concentrations of asymmetrically glycosylated IgG. 5N1 influenza A reassortants have been shown to cause severe disease during pregnancy (142\u2013147) the knowledge gained through research of the 2009 pandemic swine-derived influenza A (H1N1) virus may provide the clinical and research community with an improved capacity for early detection of a novel pandemic virus. seasonal H1N1 influenza A virus induced increased levels of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and prostaglandin-F2 in the lungs and placenta. the anti-inflammatory potential of COX-2 inhibitor therapy has already been proposed for decreasing disease severity caused by the highly pathogenic avian influenza strains H5N1 and H7N9. tility, recurrent miscarriage, and preeclampsia have yielded a wealth of information regarding the requirements of immune tolerance and rejection. this information can provide a platform for understanding healthy pregnancy and how inflammation and hormonal dysregulation will impact maternal health and fetal development."}{"summary": "influenza viruses are segmented, negative-stranded enveloped RNA viruses that cause respiratory infections, fever, malaise, coughing, and mucus
