{"summary": "chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) is a monocyte chemoattractant protein that mediates macrophage recruitment and migration during peripheral and central nervous system (CNS) inflammation. we measured microglial activation using histological and chemical measurement and recruitment of monocytes using flow cytometry. BMDCs extravasated into brain parenchyma and colabeled with microglial markers. both pro- and anti-inflammatory activation of microglia were prominent. chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) protein is well-recognized. amyloidosis in an amyloid precursor protein (APP)/CCL2 bigenic mouse model suggests a different role of CCL2 in resident microglia. also, CCL2 levels are reportedly increased in the brain, serum and cerebrospinal fluid of AD patients [20-22], further supporting a central role for this chemokine in neuroinflammation. adaptive immunity studies have suggested that CCL2 expression is strongly associated with development of Th2 responses. a single chemokine can affect two very essential pathways, suggesting that CCL2 is an attractive target in neuroinflammatory diseases. mice of the first group received bilateral, intracranial injections of rAAV9-CCL2 (n = 6) in both the hippocampus and the anterior cortex for a total of four injections. the second group received identically placed injections of rAAV-GFP (n = 6) the mice were killed 24 h later. transgenic mice express GFP under the direction of the human ubiquitin C promoter. all mice maintained in the university of south Florida health byrd Alzheimer Institute animal facility follow the according to guidelines established by \"Guide for the care and use of laboratory animals\" anteroposterior \u20132.7 mm, lateral 2.7 mm, dorsoventral 3.0 mm. cortex, anteroposterior (from bregma) +2.2 mm, lateral 1.7 mm, dorsoventral 3.0 mm. a microsyringe injector and controller were used to inject 2 l of virus at a constant rate of 2.5 l/min. 70 million to 100 million bone marrow cells from gFP transgenic mice were suspended in 2.7 ml of PBS and 0.5% bovine serum albumin. the cell suspension was applied to the supplied column in a magnetic field, and the CD11b+ fraction was separated from the unlabeled cells by washing three times with 3 ml of buffer. cells were then counted, and 5 106 freshly isolated CD11b+ cells were resuspended in 100 l of inylated secondary antibody (2 h) followed by incubation for 1 h in avidin-biotin complex. color development was performed using 1.4 mM diaminobenzidine with 0.03% hydrogen peroxide in PBS for 5 min. the right-half brain was immersed in a balanced salt solution containing 0.2% collagenase type 3 (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) and 3.0 U/ml purified dispase (Worthington Biochemical Corp, Lakewood, NJ, USA) for 45 min at 37\u00b0C followed by incubation with 40 g/ml DNase (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) after a series of triturations, the cell suspension was mixed with physiological 90% Per multiplex chemokine/cytokine assay Snap-frozen left hippocampi from the animals in cohort 2 were homogenized in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer. the protein concentration of each sample was measured using the Bradford protein assay and adjusted to 4.5 mg/ml. the bio-Plex calibration kit was prewetted with wash buffer and vacuum-filtered. mixed capture beads were then added to each well, and plates were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with shaking. the plate was washed twice and 150 l of the bio-Plex sheath fluid assay buffer were added to each well.

Statistical analyses were performed using Student\u2019s t-test or one-way analysis of variance. Graphs were generated using GraphPad Prism 4.0 software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA) rAAV9 has high transduction efficiency and drives robust gene expression. gene expression occurs as early as 1 wk in vitro and in vivo[37,38] and persists for more than 9 mo in mouse brain. rAAV9 is preferred candidate to deliver CCL2/GFP in vivo. rAAV serotype 9 virus was generated using pAAV9 and pXX6 in HEK293 cells as described previously. each animal was given an injection unilaterally (cohort 1, n = 6) or bilaterally (cohort 2, n = 6) with 2 l of rAAV9-CCL2 (7 1012 vector genome (vg/ml) or 2 l of rAAV9-GFP (control, n = 6 per cohort) tibias were removed aseptically using a 25-gauge needle. single-cell suspensions were prepared by repeat pipetting. cell preparations were passed through a 70-m nylon mesh to remove cell debris. the brains from cohort 1 and cohort 2 were perfused transcardially with PBS. each eighth section was collected with a 50-m thickness for stereology. each animal was incubated with each primary antibody overnight at room temperature. the left hemisphere was dissected into brain regions and snap-frozen for biochemical analyses including multiplex assay. the left-half brain was immersed in Hanks\u2019 balanced salt solution containing 0.2% collagenase type 3 (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) and 3.0 U/ml purified dispase (Worthington Biochemical Corp, Lakewood, NJ, USA) for 45 min at 37\u00b0C. the hippocampus was manually circumscribed and the percentage area of immunostaining was calculated in each hemisphere. a similar sized area at the site of the rAAV placement in the anterior cortex was analyzed separately. the protein concentration of each sample was measured using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) the concentrations of IL-1, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-17, interferon (IFN-), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-), CCL2, eotaxin 1 (CCL11) and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating total RNA from mouse anterior cortex (cohort 2) was reverse-transcribed using the RNeasy kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA) gene transcript functions included in this study (Table 1) have been reported previously [45-58] and were recently published by investigators at our laboratory.

PCR product of the expected size for CCL2 (440 bp) 5 million CD11b+/GFP cells (mostly monocytes) in a volume of 100 l were injected into recipient mice previously treated with rAAV9-CCL2 or rAAV9-GFP (cohort 1 or 2). using both histological evaluation and flow cytometry, we confirmed the migration of these cells into the CNS of CCL2-injected mice. data from flow cytometry profile of one of six mice per group analyzed to detect the GFP+ cells infiltrating the brain homogenate. the percentages of cells were derived from data gated on lower forward-scatter light characteristics versus FITC fluorescence intensity. rAAV9-CCL2 and rAAV9-GFP injected mice remained negative for CD45 expression in both regions of interest. microglia were activated and acquired a ramified morphology throughout both cortex and hippocampus. microglia from rAAV9-GFP injected mice remained negative for CD45 expression. microglia exhibit enhanced expression of cell-surface MHCII following CCL2 overexpression. MHCII expression is detected on activated brain microglia, as well as on infiltrating immature myeloid cells. MHCII activation is induced in the brains of CCL2-overexpressing mice. mononuclear cells/macrophages significantly increased MHCII expression following CCL2 overexpression. a few studies have reported that CCL2 overexpression can generate activation of microglia using markers such as CD45 and MHCII. IL-1 and calgranulin B (S100A9) are proinflammatory proteins that are associated with classical activated microglia. both IL-1 and calgranulin B are proinflammatory proteins that are associated with classical activated microglia. calgranulin B (Calg.B or S100-A9: (A), (B) and (C) were stained using immunohistochemistry for microglial markers representing the M1 activation state. the pattern of inflammatory cells was different in rAAV9-CCL2-injected mice than in rAAV-GFP-injected control mice. rAAV9-GFP animals did not show positive immunoreactivity for any of the alternative activation microglial markers. we performed double-immunofluorescence to determine whether infiltrating GFP+ BMDCs colocalized with markers of activated microglia. rAAV9-CCL2- and rAAV9-GFP-injected animals (cohort 2) were homogenized and processed as described above. we observed nine- and sixfold increases in the levels of IL-6 and GM-CSF. eotaxin 1 levels were increased 2.5-fold in response to CCL2 overexpression. a series of cytokine and chemokine protein expression levels were measured using the mouse multiplex assay in hippocampal tissue after rAAV9-CCL2 transduction. cytokine levels are expressed as fold changes relative to the GFP control animals (n = 6). myeloid cells and associated with phagocytosis were strongly (17-fold) increased in response to CCL2. not all the genes related to the M1 or M2 activation state of microglia were affected by CCL2. basal levels of CCL2 in rAAV9-GFP-injected animals were in the low range (0.13 ng/ml); however, as expected, expression of CCL2 was significantly higher in the hippocampi of rAAV9-CCL2-injected animals (406 ng/ml) we did not detect CCL2 immunoreactivity in the mice injected with rAAV-CCL2 or in the contralateral hemisphere. photomicrographs represent the expression of CCL2 in the ipsilateral (injected) hemisphere in GFP control (A) and (C) and CCL2 animals (B) and (D) higher magnification shows neuronal localization of CCL2 expression. unbiased stereology used to count CD11b+/GFP+ labeled cells in the CNS after overexpression of CCL2. more GFP+ cells in the rAAV-GFP-injected mice could not be counted. cells with fluorescence intensity greater than 1 104 were counted and graphed using GraphPad Prism 5 software. the right hemispheres of animals in cohort 2 were processed to isolate CNS single-cell suspensions from the CCL2- and GFP-injected mouse brains. CD45+ microglia levels were significantly higher in the parenchyma of the ipsilateral hemisphere in CCL2 injected mice compared to the control mice. microglia from rAAV9-GFP injected mice remained negative for CD45 expression in both regions of interest. microglia exhibit enhanced expression of cell-surface MHCII following CCL2 overexpression. MHCII expression is detected on activated brain resident microglia, as well as on infiltrating immature myeloid cells, which can differentiate into MHCII+ macrophages. mononuclear cells/macrophages significantly increased MHCII expression following CCL2 overexpression. images were collected from the cortices and hippocampi of wild-type mice injected with either rAAV9-GFP (A) and (C) or rAAV9-CCL2 (B) and (D) S100-A9 is an inflammatory marker protein expressed almost exclusively in myeloid cells. the positive cells were prominently located around the site of injection. the rounded mononuclear phenotype represents the newly recruited cells responding to the CCL2 stimulus. the pattern of inflammatory cells was different in rAAV9-CCL2-injected mice than in rAAV-GFP-injected control mice. the microglia of CCL2-overexpressing mice were immunoreactive for the Arg-1 marker in the ipsilateral hemisphere. yM1 represents another alternative activated microglial cell\u2013surface marker. these results suggest that microglia adopted the M2 phenotypic characteristics in response to CCL2 overexpression. we performed double-immunofluorescence to determine whether infiltrating GFP+ BMDCs colocalized with markers of activated microglia. we found that some infiltrating cells that extravasated into the parenchyma of the CCL2-treated mouse brain colabeled with YM1. hippocampi of CCL2-treated mice (5.8 1.9 pg/ml vs 7.5 3.9 pg/ml) compared to GFP-injected mice (0.5 0.2 pg/ml vs 1.2 0.4 pg/ml) eotaxin 1 levels were increased 2.5-fold in response to CCL2 overexpression. we used quantitative RT-PCR to identify genes that were differentially expressed. 7 of 14 gene transcripts were significantly changed by overexpression of CCL2. gene transcripts associated with M1 classically activated microglia were also induced. expression of iNOS, which is involved in the M1 classical activation of microglia, declined slightly, whereas expression of S100A9 RNA was unchanged, despite the increased protein observed by immunohistochemical analysis. the effect of CCL2 can be specific to some of the gene transcripts, but not to all microglia-related gene transcripts. microglia populate the CNS during early embryogenesis, whereas monocytes circulate in the blood, patrolling the environment. monocytes are generally unable to enter the brain, which is anatomically separated from the periphery by the blood-brain barrier (BBB) stereological counts showed significantly more GFP+ cells in hippocampus than in anterior cortex. no cells were observed in the contralateral hemisphere (cohort 1) in the absence of CCL2 overexpression. inflammatory stimuli (lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and pertussis toxin) promoted parenchymal infiltration of leukocytes. the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) promoter was used to overexpress CCL2 in another line of mice. this resulted in more severe disease and/or more rapid onset of symptoms. CCL2 via recombinant adenovirus serotype 5 differentially altered the outcome of the immune responses toward the Th2 phenotype. but the levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the hippocampi of CCL2 mice either were not significantly increased (TNF-, IL-1 and IL-13) or were undetectable (IFN and IL-12p70) the phagocytic activity of microglia expressing S100A8 and Sirp proteins has been reported in acute and chronic inflammation. it is still not clear whether CCL2 acts as a modulator of resident microglial phagocytosis or as a chemoattractant for peripheral macrophages to infiltrate the brain. microglia significantly induced tau pathology, possibly via IL-1/p38MAPK signaling pathway activation [93,94]. Interestingly, increased CCL2 levels have been found in the brain, serum and cerebrospinal fluid of AD patients [20,95]. MLS led the study and was involved in all aspects of it. JA participated in surgeries, bone marrow preparation, immunohistochemical staining and data acquisition. CC and XL assisted with multiplex chemokine/cytokine assay performance and analysis of data."}
