{"summary": "the IFITM3 polymorphism rs12252-C encodes an IFITM3 isoform (21 IFITM3) that lacks 21 amino acids at the N terminus (5, 6, 10) we analyzed expression of IFITM2 and IFITM3 mRNA transcripts in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) expression of IFITM mRNA transcripts in anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibody-activated CD4+ T cells (C) or moDCs (D) was analyzed by qRT-PCR. expression of 20 IFITM2 transcript ENST00000602569 is shown. transcripts ENST00000602569 and ENST00000533141 encode 20 IFITM2. expression of 20 IFITM2 was significantly lower than expression of 20 IFITM2. expression of 20 IFITM2 in activated CD4+ T cells was comparable to or higher than expression of 20 IFITM2. expression of 20 IFITM2 expression was substantial in these cells. expression of 20 IFITM2 expression was substantial in these cells. expression of 20 IFITM2 could be detected in monocytes and moDCs. the anti-IFITM2/3/20 antibody recognizes FL IFITM2, 20 IFITM2, and IFITM3. Experiments were similar to the experiments in Fig. 1E. proteintech (catalog no. 66137-1-Ig) IFITM2 FL FL IFITM2 Anti-IFITM2/3 (goat) R&D Systems (catalog no.

Error bars denote 1 SD of triplicates or SEM of duplicates. experiments were similar to the experiments in C except that anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibody-activated CD4+ T cells were treated with media, 1,000 U/mL IFN-, or 1 g/mL PHA for 2 d. phytohemagglutinin (PHA) depleted its expression (Fig. 1E and Figs. S2H and S3). recent studies have suggested that the N terminus of IFITM proteins interact with adaptor protein 2 and may regulate subcellular distribution (8, 10, 14, 22) labeled cells were imaged by confocal microscopy. percentages of voxels of IFITM proteins localizing to the plasma membrane are shown. experiments were similar to experiments in Fig. 1 F and G. IFITM1 FL IFITM1, FL IFITM2, IFITM3, 20 IFITM2 Differentially Restricts X4 and R5 HIV-1. studies have shown that IFITM proteins restrict a broad range of viruses. 20 IFITM2 differentially restricts replication of X4 and R5 HIV-1 in Jurkat E6-1 R5 cells. in contrast, infection of X4 and R5 viruses was either unaffected or enhanced. vector-transduced, rs1059091-A 20 IFITM2-expressing, or rs1059091-G 20 IFITM2-expressing, or Jurkat E6-1 R5 cells were infected with NL4-3-IeG (X4) or JRFL-IeG (R5) HIV-1. three days later, cells were harvested and analyzed by flow cytometry. the relative infectivity was determined as the percentage of GFP+ cells normalized to the kat E6-1 R5 cells were more resistant than X4 viruses to the antiviral activity of 20 IFITM2. the importance of 20 IFITM2 in regulating X4 virus infection was further demonstrated in our knockdown experiments using human primary cells. vector-transduced Jurkat E6-1 R5 cells or Jurkat E6-1 R5 cells expressing 20 IFITM2 were incubated with pLenti-based HIV-1\u2013GFP pseudotyped with env proteins from the indicated HIV-1 strains. two days later, cells were harvested and analyzed by flow cytometry. primary moDCs (A) or M-CSF\u2013derived macrophages (C) were transfected with scrambled siRNA or siRNA targeting IFITM2 transcripts. two days later, cells were incubated with NL4-3-IeG (X4) or JRFL-IeG (R5) HIV-1. native IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 inhibited IAV entry. infection of X4 viruses was unaffected. epitope tags have been shown to alter the subcellular location of IFITM proteins. A549 cells infected with replicating HIV Gag-iGFP pseudotyped with VSV-G were transduced with the vector alone or to express the indicated IFITM proteins. two days later, cell lysates and viral supernatants were analyzed by Western blotting using the indicated antibodies. same aliquots of cells used in E were analyzed by Western blotting using the indicated antibodies. authors hypothesize that entry of founder viruses and certain strains of R5 HIV-1 happens at the plasma membrane. we included a CCR5 variant with double mutations in the G protein- and arrestin-binding sites (CCR5DM) and two CCR5/CXCR4 chimeras (CCR5CXCR4 and CXCR4CCR5) by swapping their C termini in our experiments (27). these variants did not affect expression of 20 IFITM2 (Fig. S9 B and C) cells used in Fig. 4 B and C were analyzed by Western blotting. the C-terminal region contributes to the resistance of HIV-1 to 20 IFITM2-mediated restriction. resistance of 20 IFITM2 to 20 IFITM2-mediated restriction allows acute-phase infection of X4 viruses. emergence of X4 viruses could be observed in 50% of clade B HIV-1\u2013infected individuals during their clinical courses. expressing cells indicates an uncharacterized signaling pathway or cellular mechanism triggered by the C terminus of CCR5 may impede the antiviral activity of 20 IFITM2. a recent report revealed that FL IFITM2 and IFITM3 preferentially restrict X4 and R5 viruses, but not founder viruses, during endosome-mediated HIV-1 entry. 21 IFITM3 encoded by IFITM3 rs12252-C loses its ability to restrict H1N1 IAV replication in vitro. however, a similar association could not be established in research analyzing more than 5,000 subjects.
