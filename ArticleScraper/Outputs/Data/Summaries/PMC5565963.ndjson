{"summary": "the emergence of MERS-CoV in 2012 rekindled memories of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak at the beginning of the 21st century. strong evidence links the emergence of these viruses to both camel and bat species. recent metagenomic analysis has highlighted an expanding breadth of CoVs circulating in animal populations around the world. the majority of these MERS-CoV studies occurred outside the context of virus infection. we set out to evaluate the impact the absence of these viral proteins on MERS-CoV infection in respiratory cells and pathogenesis in vivo. dORF3-5 mutant attenuation mediated by host responses. dORF3-5 mutant grew to equivalent titers 24 h postinfection. host response limits dORF3-5 mutant. differentially expressed genes were grouped into clusters based on their behaviors. this resulted in clusters of augmented and/or diminished genes. this resulted in the greatest changes observed 24 h postinfection. in Tables S1 and S2, each cluster of enrichment hits is represented only by the highest-scoring member of that cluster. infection with the dORF3-5 mutant stimulates a strong host response that disrupts normal cell function and host immunity. dORF3-5 mutant induces strong interferon responses. dORF3-5 mutant produces more IFN- and IFN- transcript starting at 12 h postinfection and increasing at 24 h. notably, neither mutant virus induced increased expression of any IFN- tested. downstream interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) were also examined. dORF3-5 mutant induces NF-B-mediated inflammation. gene regulators (yellow) and connections (gray) were identified by association with positive. dORF3-5 mutant attenuated in vivo using a newly developed mouse model for MERS-CoV. despite replication attenuation, the dORF3-5 mutant was also capable of protection from a lethal MERS-CoV challenge. dORF3-5 mutant attenuates in vivo replication and protects from lethal challenge. titers showed robust antibody neutralization with wild-type and dORF3-5 mutant vaccination. dORF3-5 mutant attenuates in vivo replication and protects from lethal challenge. ne had several mutations in its backbone, including point mutations in nonstructural protein 2 (NSP2), NSP6 and NSP8. the removal of an accessory ORF in this and other mouse-adapted clones raised concerns that accessory ORF mutation may augment pathogenesis. however, following infection with the dORF3-5 mutant in the mouse-adapted backbone, 288-330+/+ mice showed no pathogenesis in terms of weight loss. the accessory ORFs have the greatest diversity even within the group. for 2C CoVs which include MERS-CoV, the greatest amino acid diversity is observed in ORF3, -4a, -4b, and -5. this suggests evolutionary pressures have shaped proteins, likely to adapt to specific aspects of their host species. inflammatory cytokines demonstrated augmented production following dORF5 infection relative to the WT. the data argue for a role in dORF5 in disrupting elements of NF-B activation and the host inflammation response following MERS-CoV infection. MERS accessory ORF mutant attenuated in human airway cells. dORF3-5 mutant mutant grew to equivalent titers 24 h postinfection. host response limits dORF3-5. dORF3-5 attenuation mediated by host responses. clusters are defined by functional category and identified by differential expression score. clusters are defined by functional category. differentially expressed genes were divided into several behavioral categories based on comparisons between mock-infected cells and cells infected with the wild type or mutant. each cluster of enrichment hits is represented only by the highest-scoring member of that cluster. this content is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license. dORF3-5 mutant induces strong interferon responses. dORF3-5 mutant induces strong interferon responses. the dORF3-5 mutant induces augmented IFN responses. the absence of MERS accessory ORFs results in augmented stimulation of the IFN- and IFN- response. dORF3-5 mutant induces NF-B-mediated inflammation. results show robust induction of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines at 12 h postinfection. dORF3-5 mutant was evaluated in vivo using a newly developed mouse model for MERS-CoV. dORF3-5 mutant replicated less efficiently in the lung, but only at day 4 postinfection. despite replication attenuation, the mutant was also capable of protection from a lethal MERS-CoV challenge. dORF3-5 mutant was generated in the context of a mouse-adapted infectious clone. mutant was generated in the context of a mouse-adapted infectious clone. dORF3-5 mutant attenuated in mouse-adapted backbone. dORF3-5 mutation attenuates the virulent MERS-CoV strain. weight loss (A) and lung titers (B) following infection of CRISPR-generated 288-330+/+ mice infected with MERS-CoV MA1 (black) or dORF3-5 MA1 (orange) at days 2 and 4. the accessory ORFs have the greatest diversity even within the group. the dORF5 mutant had a modest, but significant attenuation in replication relative to WT virus 24 and 48 h postinfection. the dORF5 mutant had no significant replication attenuation in Calu-3 cells following high-MOI infection. however, broad changes in the host response were observed in RNA expression. the trees show the degree of genetic similarity of MERS-CoV ORFs across group 2C. primary human airway epithelial cells infected with WT (black) or dORF5 mutant virus at an MOI of 0.01. the loss of accessory ORFs reduces replication and pathogenesis in vivo. the dORF3-5 vaccine provided complete protection from lethal MERS-CoV challenge and robust viral neutralization. the results demonstrate the importance of accessory ORFs in viral infection. dORF3-5 mutant failed to induce changes in IFN pathways. the dORF5 mutant may only partially influence the inflammatory response. tagged protein/mass spectrometry provides a rapid means to identify interaction partners. dORF3-5 mutant in the wild-type MERS-CoV backbone demonstrated replication attenuation in several in vivo models. deletion of ORF3-5 also attenuated the virulent mouse-adapted MERS-CoV indicating a role for the MERS accessory ORFs in lethal disease. the validity of dORF3-5 as a vaccine platform requires examination of genetic stability. initial studies need to determine if sterilizing immunity is established following dORF3-5 vaccine challenge at earlier times. however, further stability studies are required to advance the dORF3-5 mutant as a live attenuated vaccine platform. our results indicate a role for ORF5 in modulation of NF-B-mediated inflammation. the data provide clear evidence for MERS-CoV accessory ORFs. both wild-type and mutant viruses were derived from either the MERS-CoV wild type or the corresponding mouse-adapted (MA1 [herein referred to as WT]) infectious clone. RNA isolation, microarray processing, and identification of DE were carried out as previously described. each cluster is represented only by the highest-scoring enrichment hit in each cluster and scored according to the negative log10 P value of the significance of the enrichment for that top hit. study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations for care and use of animals by the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW) wild-type and mutant MERS-CoVs were previously described (20) and cultured on vero 81 cells, grown in modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) and 5% fetal clone serum (HyClone, South Logan, UT) dORF3-5 and dORF5 mutants were previously described. RNA isolation, microarray processing, and identification of DE were carried out as previously described (40) gene isolation and microarray processing were carried out as previously described (40) infected mice were monitored for weight loss, morbidity, and clinical signs of disease, and lung titers were determined as described previously. infected animals were monitored for weight loss, morbidity, and clinical signs of disease."}
