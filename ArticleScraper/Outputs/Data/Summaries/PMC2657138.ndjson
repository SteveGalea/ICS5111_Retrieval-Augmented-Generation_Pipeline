{"summary": "avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strain M41 primarily induces a disease of the respiratory system. different IBV strains may show variable tissue tropisms and also affect the oviduct and the kidneys. bronchitis virus is the prototype species of the family Coronaviridae. more than 25 genotypes are distributed worldwide. IBV causes an acute highly contagious viral respiratory disease of chickens. Inoculation of 103 EID50 IBV M41 in SPF ECE resulted in death of embryos at 24 h (3 embryos), 41 h (2 embryos) and single embryonic death at 65, 87 and 120 h after experimental infection. only one embryo showed non specific death at 24 h PI as it showed negative results in both immunostaining and virus recovery assays. positive immunostaining was also detected in macrophages of both spleen (41, 48, 65, 72, 87 h PI) in the kidney, viral proteins were detected in both renal tubules (72 h PI) and glomeruli (41, 48, 87 h PI), lung (41, 87 h PI), skin (48, 87, 120 h PI), eye sclera (65 h PI) leen (Macrophages) +++ 7 48 Alive CAM + 106 Nasal mucosa (epithelium) ++ Skin (epidermis) + 8 48 Alive CAM + 105 Nasal mucosa (epithelium) ++ Skin (epidermis) + 9 65 Dead Brain (neurons) + 105 CAM: + Eye (sclera) + Gizzard ++ Liver + Spinal cord (neurons) + chorioallantoic membrane was titrated in chicken embryo kidney cell culture. virus titter was expressed as TCID50. antigen detection method is preferably performed 2 to 3 days after inoculation. maximum IBV virus titers reached 1 to 2 days post-inoculation. allantoic fluid showed high virus titers 24\u201387 h PI. infected CAM was positive in all inoculated eggs from which virus was recovered. IBV infection of the proventriculus was firstly recorded in china [3] then detected with UNAM-97 IBV Mexican variant that produced decrease in the proventricular gland papillary branching. this is the first time that the prototype IBV strain M41 was also detected within the muscle layer of the proventriculus. the susceptibility for IBV infection is associated with the expression of 2,3-linked sialic acid which is used by the virus for primary attachment to the cell surface. the initial target of avian influenza viruses and IBV in chicken is the respiratory epithelium. this molecule may also be used by IBV for infection of the respiratory tract. the abundance of polysialylated N-CAM declines gradually during the embryonic development and the synthesis dramatically decreases right before birth. chicken embryo kidney cells were prepared from specific pathogen free embryonated chicken eggs (ECE) as described elsewhere. inoculated eggs were harvested and clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 925 g. the obtained supernatants were used for titration in CEK. the presence of IBV antigens was investigated in CAM and embryos. the sections were counter-stained with Mayer's haematoxylin. the staining intensities observed microscopically were divided into four grades. each tissue 10 randomly selected areas of each compartment were evaluated at high power by light microscopy. chicken embryo kidney cells were prepared from specific pathogen free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs (ECE) were isolated, washed with Hanks' balanced salts solution, minced and disaggregated in trypsin solution. after centrifugation the cells were resuspended in Dulbeccos' modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and grown at 37\u00b0C. sections were dewaxed in xylene, rehydrated, treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide and then subjected to antigen retrieval by microwaving in 10 mM citric buffer (pH 6.0) for 10 min. non specific background staining was blocked by incubating the sections for 20 min. with goat serum. sections were then incubated for 1 h with 1:3000 rabbit anti-IBV polyclonal serum. titration 100 l of tenfold serial dilutions in MEM were added to 105 CEK cells per well. after 48 h of incubation, cells were fixed with acetone-methanol."}
