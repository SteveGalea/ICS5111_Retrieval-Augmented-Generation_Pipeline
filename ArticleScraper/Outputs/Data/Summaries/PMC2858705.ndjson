{"summary": "coronaviruses belong to the order Nidovirales and are characterized by the largest positive-strand RNA ((+) RNA) genomes. the 5\u2032-proximal two-thirds of the coV genome are translated into the viral replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab. the 3\u2032-proximal third encodes the viral structural proteins and several so-called accessory proteins. nsp16 encodes an AdoMet-dependent mRNA cap (nucleoside-2\u2032O)-methyltransferase (2\u2032O-MTase) nsp16 encodes an exo- and an endoribonuclease (nsp13; [13], [14] and an endoribonuclease (nsp14 and nsp15; [15], [16], and an S-adenosy two polyproteins are then cleaved by viral proteases in order to produce 16 nsps. white triangles are used for positions targeting exonuclease motifs of nsp14. black triangles are used for positions targeting MTase motifs of nsp14. lyltransferase (GTase) catalyzes transfer of GMP to remaining 5\u2032-diphosphate terminus. higher eukaryotes convert cap-0 into cap-1 or cap-2 structures [25], [26], [28] by means of 2\u2032O-MTases, which methylate the ribose 2\u2032O-position of the first and the second nucleotide of the mRNA. nsp16 and nsp14 specifically interact with nsp10 [35], [36] suggesting that nsp10 may play a role in the viral capping pathway. nsp10 was also shown to bind single- and double-strand RNA and DNA with low affinity and without obvious sequence specificity. nsp14 and nsp16 appear to play an important role in viral replication. aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA), which inhibits SARS-CoV replication, targets both MTases indeed. nsp14 was expressed as a fusion protein with an intein tag at its C-terminus. the nsp14-intein product was bound to a chitin affinity column. the untagged protein was eluted after removal of the tag by DTT. all three proteins were further purified by size exclusion chromatography. MTase assays performed on short capped RNA substrates methylated or not at the guanine cap (7MeGpppAC5 and GpppAC5) the purified proteins were incubated with the substrate in presence of the tritiated methyl donor [3H]-AdoMet. nsp14 methylated GpppAC5 in a time-dependent manner. nsp16 did not methylate 7MeGpppAC5 or 7MeGpppAC5. nsp16 catalyzed methyltransfer to neither GpppAC5 nor 7MeGpppAC5. nsp14 methylates GpppAC5 at the N7-position of the cap guanine. nsp16 acts as an nsp10-dependent 2\u2032O-MTase on 7MeGpppAC5. nsp14 and the nsp16 pair can perform sequential double methylation of GpppAC5. nsp16 were quantified, a ratio of nsp10 to nsp16 of 1.1 was obtained. this suggests that the complex does not contain a large molar excess of nsp10. this suggests that the complex does not contain a large molar excess of nsp10. nsp14, nsp16, and nsp10 were digested by nuclease P1 in order to release the RNA cap structure. radiolabeled cap molecules were separated on TLC plates and visualized using autoradiography. the comparison with commercially available and in-house synthesized cap analogs allowed the identification of the methylation position of the cap structure. incubation of 7MeGpppAG-SARS-264 RNA, with nsp14, nsp16 or nsp16 alone did not result in 2\u2032O-methylation of the 7MeGpppA structure. capped RNA corresponding to the first 264 nucleotides of the SARS-CoV genome represents a bona fide substrate to follow the RNA cap MTase activities of nsp14 and n panel A: Capped RNAs corresponding to the first 264 nucleotides of the SARS-CoV genome were incubated with SARS-CoV proteins. labeled substrates G*pppAG-264 or 7MeG*pppAG-264 RNA were incubated alone or in presence of the indicated proteins. panel B: Time course analysis of the N7- and 2\u2032O-methylation by nsp14 and nsp16/ns nsp10 (1.2 M), nsp14 (50 nM) and nsp16 (200 nM) were ted with a mixture of nsp10 (1.2 M), nsp14 (50 nM) and nsp16 (200 nM) the final point corresponds to 20 h. mutated conserved residues in the MTase and the exoribonuclease domain. the conserved residue D331, which is presumably involved in AdoMet-binding, was mutated to alanine. exonuclease domain did not significantly interfere with nsp14 MTase activity. the motif I-double mutant (D90XE92) showed attenuated N7-MTase activity (2-fold) an altered N-terminus of the exoribonuclease domain abolished the N7-MTase activity in a yeast trans-complementation assay [17] the 2\u2032O-MTase activity of the wt protein in the presence of nsp10 was arbitrarily set to 100%. the bar graph represents the mean of 3 independent experiments. the purified His6-tagged proteins analyzed by SDS-PAGE are shown in the lower panel. the 2\u2032O-MTase activity was abolished by any single mutation of the putative K46-D130-K170-E203 catalytic tetrad residues of nsp16. nsp10 stimulates the 2\u2032O-MTase activity by a yet unknown mechanism, but the catalytic activity itself resides in nsp16. adenosine- and AdoMet-analogs 2\u2032,3\u2032,5\u2032-tri-O-acetyl-adenosine and S-5\u2032-adenosyl-L-cysteine were tested as well as GTP, 7MeGTP, GTP- or cap-analogs (ribavirin and its triphosphate as well as EICAR-triphosphate, GpppA and 7MeGppp the IC50 values of AdoHcy were 16 and 12 M for the N7- and 2\u2032O-MTases. nsp14 and nsp10/nsp16 with IC50 values of 496 nM and 736 nM respectively. nsp14 and nsp16 MTases are two putative targets of ATA. nsp14 (50 nM) and nsp16/nsp10 (200 nM/1.2 M) were incubated with GpppAC5 (in grey) and 7MeGpppAC5 (in black) panel A: Methyl transfer was measured at a final concentration of 100 M of each inhibitor candidate. outcome of control reaction in absence of inhibitor and at 5% of DMSO was set to 100%. SARS-CoV nsp14 is active as AdoMet-dependent N7-MTase on short capped RNA substrates. nsp16 2\u2032O-MTase requires nsp10 as co-factor. coronaviruses encode two separate MTases that catalyze last two steps in the formation of a methylated RNA-cap structure. the identity of the recombinant proteins was confirmed by trypsin digestion and mass spectrometry. the identity of the recombinant proteins was confirmed by trypsin digestion and mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF), data not shown. the methyl transfer to the capped RNA substrate was determined after 5-, 30-, and 240 min incubation by using a filter-binding assay. nsp14 methylated GpppAC5 in a time-dependent manner whereas neither nsp16 nor nsp16 alone did. nsp14 catalyzed methylation to neither GpppAC5 nor 7MeGpppAC5. methylation of 7MeGpppAC5 was observed when nsp16 activity assays were supplemented with nsp10. nsp16 catalyzed methylation of 7MeGpppAC5 but not of GpppAC5. the 2\u2032O-MTase activity of nsp16-nsp10 requires the presence of a cap structure already methylated at its N7-position and (iv) nsp14 and the nsp16-nsp10 pair can perform sequential double methylation of GpppAC5. nsp10 stimulated nsp16 MTase activity by direct association. mRNA cap N7- and 2\u2032O-site specific methylation by SARS-CoV nsp14 and nsp10/nsp16. we synthesized a 5\u2032-triphosphate-carrying RNA corresponding to the first 264 nucleotides of the SARS-CoV genome using the T7 RNA polymerase. the RNA was capped with [-32P]-GTP using the vaccinia virus ca nsp14 converts 83% of the substrate into the 7MeGpppA product. nsp10 or nsp16 alone did not show any MTase activity. incubation of 7MeGpppAG-SARS-264 RNA did not result in 2\u2032O-methylation of the 7MeGpppA structure. nsp10/nsp16 methylates RNA cap structures at the 2\u2032O-position of the first nucleotide after the N7-methylated cap. we conclude that nsp14 exhibits N7-MTase activity in the absence of nsp10, whereas the latter is an absolute requirement for nsp16-mediated 2\u2032O-methylation of the cap structure. panel A: Capped RNAs corresponding to the first 264 nucleotides of the SARS-CoV genome were incubated with SARS-CoV proteins. labeled substrates G*pppAG-264 or 7MeG*pppAG-264 RNA were incubated alone or in presence of the indicated proteins, digested by nuclease P1 and analyzed by TLC. 7MeGpppA, 7MeGpppA2' OMe and GpppA2' OMe cap analog standards are indicated. the results indicate that methylation of the substrate actually starts at the N7-position. nsp10, nsp14, and nsp16 are not methylated by nsp16. conserved residues in both the MTase and exoribonuclease domain were mutated to alanine. the conserved residue D331, which is presumably involved in AdoMet-binding, was mutated to alanine. all the His-tagged nsp14 mutant proteins could be expressed. an altered N-terminus of the exoribonuclease domain may still interfere with the MTase activity to a certain extent. panel A: Residues of the nsp14 exoribonuclease and MTase catalytic sites were mutated to alanine. we mutated the conserved residues K46-D130-K170-E203 as a catalytic tetrad of mRNA cap 2\u2032O-MTases. three of the four alanine point mutants could be expressed as efficiently as wt nsp16, allowing their purification to homogeneity. nsp16 and nsp16/nsp10 Viral MTases exhibit many original features relative to their host cell MTase counterparts. we determined the conditions to measure optimum MTase activity for nsp14 and nsp16/nsp10. guanosine-containing structures, adenosine- and AdoMet-analogs 2\u2032,3\u2032,5\u2032-tri-O-acetyl-adenosine and S-5\u2032-adenosyl-L-cysteine were tested as well as GTP, 7MeGTP, GTP- or cap-analogs (ribavirin and its triphosphate as well as EICAR-triphosphate, Gp nsp14 and nsp10/nsp16 with reported IC50 values of 496 nM and 736 nM respectively. the obtained IC50 values of ATA for nsp14 and nsp10/nsp16 were 6.4 M and 2.1 M respectively. nsp14 and nsp16/nsp10 MTases are two putative targets of ATA. panel A: Methyl transfer was measured at a final concentration of 100 M of each inhibitor candidate. outcome of control reaction in absence of inhibitor and at 5% of DMSO was set to 100%. nsp13 (RNA 5\u2032- triphosphatase/helicase [13] and nsp14 (N7-MTase [17]) failed to exhibit activity under a wide range of experimental conditions, including those used for FCoV nsp16 [18]. however, the predicted 2\u2032O-MTase activity of nsp16 failed to exhibit activity under a wide range of experimental conditions, including those used for FCoV nsp16 these results confirm and extend the recently described observations on the cap N7-MTase activity of SARS-CoV nsp14 in vitro and in a yeast-based complementation system. in contrast to nsp14, bacterially expressed SARS-CoV nsp16 forms a complex with nsp10 that is endowed with robust and long-lived MTase activity. this suggests that FCoV nsp16 might also need FC nsp10 protein was previously proposed to play a role in viral RNA synthesis [11], [39], [40] and replicase polyprotein processing [40] on the basis of the analysis of MHV nsp10 mutants. in this work, we propose a new function for nsp10 as a regulator of an enzyme involved in the methylation of cap structures. nsp10 may increase the stability of nsp16, stabilize the nsp16 RNA binding groove, contribute to RNA substrate binding and/or allosterically regulate its substrate affinity and activity. the presence of two Zn fingers is a major structural feature of nsp10 that is likely related to its biological functions. the affinity of nsp10 for single-stranded RNA appears too weak to explain a direct role in RNA recruitment for nsp16 [36] the formation of the complex nsp10/nsp16 might provide a longer substrate-binding site and in that way enhance affinity of nsp16 for its RNA substrate. further work is needed in order to understand the molecular basis of nsp16 activation by nsp10. the modular structure of two separate single-domain enzymes corresponds to the scenario in metazoan and plants. it contrasts to dsRNA reoviruses where one multi-domain protein contains two MTase domains [60] and to flaviviruses and negative-strand RNA ((-) vesiculoviruses where both MTase activites reside in a single domain of larger proteins. the regulation of the 2\u2032O-MTase activity of nsp16 by the small nsp10 protein is clearly an original feature of CoV mRNA cap methylation. coronavirus MTases as potential targets for antiviral inhibitors Virally encoded RNA cap N7- and 2\u2032O-MTase activities have been identified. ATA, a compound previously reported as a putative blocker of the catalytic site of NS5MTase of flaviviruses, inhibited both SARS-CoV MTase activities. nsp14 and nsp16/nsp10 are two of the SARS-CoV targets of ATA leading, or at least contributing, to the inhibition of SARS-CoV replication. at least a 10-fold molar excess of nsp10 is required for maximum stimulation of nsp16. quantification of the protein bands of nsp10 and nsp16 in the purified complex indicates a maximum ratio of 2.3. the dissociation constant of the nsp10/nsp16 complex can roughly be estimated to be in the order of 400 nM for a 11 complex. nsp10 is structurally homologous to the cap 2\u2032O-MTase of reovirus. the presence of two Zn fingers is a major structural feature of nsp10. the presence of two Zn fingers is a major structural feature of nsp10. coV mRNA cap methylation appears to follow the sequence of N7-methylation preceding the 2\u2032O-methylation. nsp14 recognizes non-methylated RNA cap exclusively, and nsp10/nsp16 recognizes N7-methylated RNA cap exclusively. nsp10/nsp16 recognizes both non-methylated and methylated cap structures with equal affinity. N7- and 2\u2032O-MTase activity is regulated by specific 5\u2032-proximal viral RNA secondary structures. both n7- and 2\u2032O-MTase activities seem to require the terminal dinucleotide AG [32], [64]. the mechanism to achieve this selectivity may depend on the GTase reaction or the fine regulation of capping enzymes by protein interactions within the replication and transcription complex. mutants abolishing the N7-MTase activity have a clear detrimental effect on replication [32], whereas 2\u2032O-MTase knockouts exerted more moderate effects [33] these observations suggest that compounds specifically inhibiting cap MTases could be potent antiviral agents. sinefungin inhibits fungal mRNA cap N7-MTases with 5 to 10 times more potency than the human isoform [71] compounds tested as MTase inhibitors were purchased from new England BioLabs. they were dissolved in H2O or DMSO as previously described.

Herdewijn. they were dissolved in H2O or DMSO as previously described [18], [52], [53] and ATA was dissolved in 0.1 M NaOH as described in [52]. SARS-CoV nsp10/nsp16 complex was produced in E. coli in a bi-promotor expression plasmid kindly provided by Bruno Coutard (AFMB France) in this backbone, SARS CoV nsp10 can be expressed under a tet promoter and encodes a protein in fusion with a N-terminal strep tag. nsp16 is expressed under a T7 promoter and encode nsp10 expression was performed during 4 h at 37\u00b0C. nsp14- and nsp16-expressing bacteria were incubated during 16 h at 17\u00b0C. proteins were purified by two steps of chromatography. the bacterial lysate was loaded onto the column, washed with 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 1 M NaCl and 0.5% Triton X-100. the column was then incubated in 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 50 mM DTT at 4\u00b0C for 48 hours. the identity of each of the purified proteins was confirmed by MALDI-TOF after trypsin digestion. capped RNAs (7MeGpppAC5, GpppAC5) were synthesized in vitro using bacteriophage T7 DNA primase.
