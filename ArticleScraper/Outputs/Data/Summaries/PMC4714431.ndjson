{"summary": "entry processes are commonly analyzed by monitoring internalized virus particles via Western blotting, polymerase chain reaction, and imaging techniques that allow scientist to track the intracellular location of the pathogen. there is dearth of knowledge in regards to trafficking of a virus via endosomes. we are confident that such an approach will serve as a powerful tool to directly study intracellular trafficking of a virus, signaling events occurring on endosomes, and dynamics of molecular events within endosomes that are crucial for uncoating."}
