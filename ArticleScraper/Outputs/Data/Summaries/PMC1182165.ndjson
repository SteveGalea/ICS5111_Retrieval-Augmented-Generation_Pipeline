{"summary": "eukaryotic 1 ribosomal frameshifting is a translational regulation mechanism adopted by a variety of viruses to synthesize two or more proteins at a fixed ratio starting with a single translation initiation site from the same open reading frame (1\u20134) the ribosome is induced to move one base backward in the 5\u2032 direction, and then continues translation in the new 1 reading frame. doknot RNA element has been characterized to be responsible for inducing 1 frameshift efficiency in HIV-1 (7,8) there is no clear picture to correlate frameshift efficiency with a specific RNA pseudoknot stimulator. resistance of a pseudoknot against deformation by a marching ribosome can cause the elongating ribosome to pause. RNA that encodes the RdRp contains a slippery site of sequences UUUAAAC. an elongating ribosome will fall from the viral RNA template without synthesizing RdRp if 1 frameshifting did not occur in front of this in-frame stop codon. defining the biologically relevant mRNA secondary structure may provide useful information for anti-SARS strategy. pCRII-SARS12 265\u201313 653 were used for PCR amplification of the desired cDNA encoding SARS CoV viral RNAs from p2luc. the amplified inserts were then sub-cloned into the SalI/BamHI sites of p2luc vectors. the resulting vectors were transformed into DH5 cell for the maintenance and selection by ampicillin. RNA structure probing RNA transcripts spanning the SARS13 377\u201313 475 region of SARS CoV was generated by in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase. purified RNA of desired length was then dephosphorylated by shrimp alkaline phosphatase and 5\u2032 end labeled with [-32P]ATP. all the experiments were performed in 50 l reaction volumes containing 50 000\u201370 000 c.p.m. of 5\u2032 end label a 25 l reaction containing 500 ng of DNA template, 12.5 l of reticulocyte lysate and 0.8 l of 10 Ci 35S-labeled methionine (NEN) was incubated at 30\u00b0C for 1.5 h. the samples were then resolved by 12% SDS\u2013PAGE and exposed to PhosphorImager screen. control experiments with the plasmids of 100\u20131000 ng produce similar results for frameshift efficiency. luciferase activity measurements for both in vitro reticulocyte lysate and in vivo transfected 293T cell lysates were performed by using the dual-luciferaseTM reporter assay (Promega) all the experiments were repeated three times with four to six assays for each reaction. two complementary oligonucleotides containing the sense and the antisense sequences corresponding to the 3\u2032 end and 5\u2032 star region of the two fragments planned to be jointed were synthesized chemically. the two individual PCR products with partially overlapping sequences were then assembled by the PCR-based ligation procedure (22) the identities of all cloned and mutated genes were confirmed by DNA sequencing analysis. all the RNase protection experiments were performed in 50 l reaction volumes containing 50 000\u201370 000 c.p.m. of 5\u2032 end labeled RNA in the presence of RNase cleavage buffer (30 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 7.5, 3 mM EDTA and 200 mM NaCl) the RNAs were denatured by heating at 70\u00b0C for 5 min. a 25 l reaction containing 500 ng of DNA template, 12.5 l of reticulocyte lysate and 0.8 l of 10 Ci 35S-labeled methionine (NEN) was incubated at 30\u00b0C for 1.5 h. the samples were then resolved by 12% SDS\u2013PAGE and exposed to PhosphorImager screen for quantification after drying. control experiments with the plasmids of 100\u20131000 ng produce similar results for frame luciferase-based frameshift efficiency was performed with control plasmids to calibrate the ribosome drop-off effect as described previously (21). RESULTS The 1 frameshifting stimulator of SARS CoV contains an atypical H-type pseudoknot with an extra stem\u2013loop in loop 2 Sequence alignment of the junction regions of ORF 1ab of SARS CoV and other coronaviruses indicated the existence of conserved UUUAAAC slippery site cis RNA elements involved in 1 frameshifting for a set of related coronaviruses. the slippery site is boxed and typed in gray. the complementary base pairing counterpart of stem regions 1 and 2 (S1-S1C and S2-S2C) of stimulator are underlined and boxed by solid line. the SARS13 377\u201313 475 RNA adopts a single conformation. this is consistent with the existence of a stem conformation within the loop 2 in this atypical IBV-type pseudoknot. enzymatic cleavage result was resolved in a 10% sequencing gel with the first two lanes representing pyrimidines and guanine assignment markers. frameshift efficiency for mutants with compensatory base changes rises back to wild-type level (55%) similar results are observed for mutants destroying or reforming base pairs in the mapped duplex region. in either portion by compensatory base changes restored frameshift efficiency to the wild-type level. intriguingly, frameshift efficiency does not reduce further when more bases were mutated to disrupt all the potential base pair in S3. a pseudoknot mutant lacking the S3 but harboring an 8 nt loop 2 has a frameshift efficiency of 53%. extension of viral insert in the 5\u2032 direction upstream of the slippery site measured frameshift efficiencies. analysis of these data suggested that the proximal 150 nt region upstream of the slippery site has most of the observed downregulation effect. together, it argues that the viral RNA may possess a signal for the attenuation of 1 frameshift efficiency. the chimera construct has the potential attenuation signal fused downstream to the pseudoknot stimulator. the downregulation effect almost disappears for a chimera construct that has the potential attenuation signal fused downstream to the pseudoknot stimulator. the RNA sequences and amino acids of polypeptide encoded by the reading frameshifted mutant are shown. the amino acids that remain unchanged are typed in bold face. the most stable secondary structure of residue 13 222\u201313 368 RNA predicted by RNAstructure version 4.11 (27) the general attenuation signal embedded in SARS13 222\u201313 368 RNA is a novel negative determinant for 1 frameshifting. the attenuation signal downregulates 1 frameshifting promoted by other pseudoknot stimulators. the calculated frameshift efficiency is shown in the bottom of the gel. se ORF to utilize the dual-luciferase activity to monitor frameshift efficiency in vivo (21) the frameshift efficiency of these constructs was calculated from the in vitro assay result of the TNT products of both plasmids. the frameshift efficiency reduced almost in half in the presence of attenuation signal compared with the one lacking the attenuation signal (lane 2 in Figure 6C) frameshift assay using either of the reporters indicated that the selected viral RNA sequences possess a frameshift efficiency of 60%. this suggests that the SARS13 369\u201313 520 RNA contains an efficient 1 frameshifting stimulator. the cleavage pattern by RNase V1 (lanes 5 and 6) can be localized to the three predicted stem regions (S1, S2 and S3). however, co-existence of cleavage by both RNase V1 and single-strand sensitive probes can be found for nucleotides localized to the junction region between S2 and S3. this is probably caused by a dynamic conformational equilibrium in this region as non-denaturing gel analysis suggests that the SARS13 frameshift efficiency drops from 60% for wild-type construct to 1% for both 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 mutants that prevent the formation of base pairing in S1. similar results are observed for S2 with mutants destroying or reforming base pairs in the mapped duplex region. lower sensitivity to base pairing disruption is observed for mutants located in the mapped S3 region. restoring the base pairing scheme in either portion restored frameshift efficiency to the wild-type level. a pseudoknot mutant lacking the S3 but harboring an 8 nt loop 2 possesses a frameshift efficiency of 53%. analysis of a viral RNA genome containing a longer viral construct has revealed a very different frameshift efficiency from those observed in this work (26). a series of longer viral RNA-containing reporters with stepwise extension of viral insert in the 5\u2032 direction upstream of the slippery site can downregulate 1 frameshift efficiency in vitro. we constructed a series of longer viral RNA-containing reporters with stepwise extension of viral insert in the 5\u2032 direction. cartoons are used to illustrate the relative orientation of the attenuation signal, the slippery site and the stimulator within the inserts under analysis. the identity of insert within each reporter construct and the calculated frameshift efficiency are shown in top and bottom of the gel. chimera construct has the potential attenuation signal fused downstream to the pseudoknot stimulator. the most stable secondary structure of residue 13 222\u201313 368 RNA predicted by RNA structure version 4.11 (27) is downregulation effect of 1 frameshift efficiency in vitro. a weaker downregulation effect is observed when the attenuation signal is coupled to the minimal MMTV pseudoknot comparing with the minimal IBV pseudoknot. luciferase-related segments were also created to analyze frameshift efficiencies. the results reveal parallel results with the previous study in Figures 4A and 6A. the plotted values are the mean value calculated from three independent experiments with the error bars representing SD. we constructed several p2luc-based reporters for inserts with or lacking SARS13 222\u201313 368 viral RNA without shifting the stop codon located before firefly luciferase ORF to utilize the dual-luciferase activity to monitor frameshift efficiency in vivo (21). the impairment of 1 frameshifting can be rationalized by the formation of two separated hairpins and the coupled destruction of pseudoknot configuration. the long loop 2 of the IBV-type pseudoknot has been thought to play a connection role to link the two stems (25). this is consistent with the wild-type like frameshift efficiency for the mutant lacking S3 in this study. the additional stem of 229E pseudoknot is formed by complementary sequences between the very long loop 2 and the 3\u2032 end sequences following stem 2. the S3 of SARS CoV pseudoknot could stack into the bottom of S1 to form a quasi-continuous helix of 25\u201326 bp interrupted by two separated A-bulges. helical junction geometry between S1 and S2 obviously will be coupled to the positioning of S3. a conserved hairpin upstream of the slippery site was proposed to slow down the marching ribosome and thus enhance 1 frameshift efficiency in the case of BYDV (38). however, only short sequences immediately upstream of the slippery site are involved in the case of HIV-1. however, a conserved hairpin upstream of the slippery site was proposed to slow down the marching ribosome and thus enhance 1 frameshift efficiency. 14 out of 18 amino acids encoded within SARS13 318\u201313 368 RNA were changed in the out of frame mutant. it is more likely that the attenuation signal can contact with and affect factors capable of modulating the frameshift efficiency. however, the fact that the attenuation signal also downregulates 1 frameshifting promoted by other stimulators suggests its function is general. the impairment of 1 frameshifting for mutants with the disruption of S1 or S2 in SARS CoV pseudoknot can be rationalized by the formation of two separated hairpins and the coupled destruction of pseudoknot configuration. the long loop 2 of the IBV-type pseudoknot has been thought to play a connection role to link the two stems (25). the additional stem of 229E pseudoknot is formed by complementary sequences between the very long loop 2 and the 3\u2032 end sequences following stem 2. the S3 of SARS CoV pseudoknot could stack into the bottom of S1 to form a quasi-continuous helix of 25\u201326 bp interrupted by two separated A-bulges. helical junction geometry between S1 and S2 will be coupled to the positioning of S3. a conserved hairpin upstream of the slippery site was proposed to slow down the marching ribosome and thus enhance 1 frameshift efficiency in the case of BYDV (38). however, only short sequences immediately upstream of the slippery site are involved in the case of HIV-1, and the modulation can go either way for enhancement or attenuation without a defined activity. 18 amino acids encoded within SARS13 318\u201313 368 RNA were changed in the out of frame mutant. no dramatic change in attenuation activity has been observed. attenuation signal can contact and affect factors capable of modulating frameshift efficiency."}
