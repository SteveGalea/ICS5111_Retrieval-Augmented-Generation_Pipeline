Cpd2 dissolved in 70:30 v/v Tween 80/ethanol (Sigma) and diluted 10-fold in sterile water was administered in 100, 66, or 33 mg/kg dose per mouse. all treatments were administered intraperitoneally daily for 4 consecutive days. synchronized P. falciparum segmented schizonts were cultivated for 12 h in serum-containing medium. proteins were separated on 4\u201312% Criterion XT precast gels. the primary anti-PvSUB1 polyclonal serum was used at a dilution of 1:500 and 1:1000. new trophozoites were numbered by cytometry at the end of the incubation. results show the mean of two independent experiments and are expressed as percent inhibition of the formation of young trophozoites compared with the mock-treated culture (1% DMSO as the vehicle of Cpd2). antibody solutions were prepared in PBS, 1% Albumax. diluted at 1:5000 was added to the secondary antibody solution. images were collected on a Leica DM5000B microscope. the first processing site generating PvSUB1r-a (47 kDa), thought to be the result of auto-maturation, was located at the sequence KLVGA(D/D)VSL. a second processing site was identified from the N-terminal sequence of PvSUB1r-b (42 kDa), namely PPSHA(A/S)S, which is absent from PbSUB1r (Fig. 1A). a third processing generated PvSUB1r-c (39 kDa, Fig. 1A) by cleavage at the site HLA(G/S)K. this has not been reported for any other Plasmodium SUB1 enzymes. the purified PvSUB1r produced in the same expression system did not contain this additional band. immunoblot of uninfected human erythrocytes (lane 1), P. falciparum 3D7 segmented schizonts (lane 2), and in vitro maturated P. vivax segmented schizonts (lane 3) probed with anti-PvSUB1r serum. Molecular mass markers are in kDa. the two fluorophore/quencher pairs reported to affect enzyme affinity for some synthetic substrates (41). Interestingly, both enzymes had similar Km, app for the cognate and for the heterologous substrates. this indicates that development of inhibitors equally effective on both enzymes is a realistic goal. we identified two bands on protein extracts from in vitro maturated P. vivax segmented schizonts. these bands migrated with an apparent molecular mass similar to that of PvSUB1r-a and PvSUB1r-b. no endogenous PvSUB1 form equivalent to PvSUB1r-c could be detected. a similar pattern was observed with air-dried P. vivax segmented schizont lytic domain were constructed based on seven bacterial subtilisin structures as templates. these high resolution structures represented the best compromise in terms of resolution and sequence similarities with PfSUB1 and PvSUB1 catalytic domains. these high resolution structures represented the best compromise in terms of resolution and sequence similarities. modelized structure of the PvSUB1 catalytic domain predicted secondary structure. a, topology of the PvSUB1 catalytic domain (purple) is indicated in black. the residues forming the S1 and S4 sub-pockets are depicted in green and blue. the core structure of the modeled PvSUB1 catalytic domain contained a six-stranded parallel -sheet (residues 311\u2013316, 398\u2013403, 430\u2013433, 457\u2013461, 497\u2013503, and 526\u2013529) the PvSUB1-Belem sequence, used here as the prototypical PvSUB1, contains seven cysteine residues in positions Cys-313, Cys-402, Cys-419, Cys-423, Cys-465, Cys-478, and Cys-524. the four first cysteines are very close in space, which might indicate the presence of two disulfide bridges. the low pKa value of these groups (4) indicates that they are most likely negatively charged. electrostatic calculation shows a negative environment favorable for the binding of a cation. no clear information could be derived from the models about the positions of the weaker sites mentioned. we defined binding site residues in PvSUB1 as those not belonging to insertion loops and equivalent to residues in 2TEC which had at least one atom less than 6 apart from the Eglin hexapeptide P1\u2032\u2013P5. we also included a few residues that define superficial S1\u2032 and S2\u2032 sub-pockets formed in PvSUB1. we used the FlexX, FlexX-Pharm, and ICM software packages to perform docking screens on the 149,992 pre-selected drug-like compounds. a pharmacophore was also deduced from the known structures of subtilisins crystallized with an inhibitor. the ChemDiv chemical library was filtered in silico to exclude compounds predicted to form aggregates. the resulting 149,992 compounds were used for docking on three three-dimensional models of PvSUB1 active site. the set of 306 best-scored compounds was tested for inhibition of PvSUB1r enzymatic activity at a concentration of 50 m. apparent Ki of the five selected compounds for PvSUB1r ranged from 30.1 to 6 m. Cpd4 and Cpd5 displayed a Ki, app for PvSUB1r and an EC50 against P. falciparum-3D7 growth in vitro. the apparent Ki for PvSUB1r and IC50 on the parasite growth are expressed as the mean ( S.D.) of a minimum of three independent experiments. results presented are the mean ( S.D.) of at least three independent experiments. the central quinoline group was positioned between the \u2032 and \u2032\u2032 strands of the PvSUB1 catalytic groove. the indole and \u201cparamethoxyaniline\u201d moieties of Cpd2 interacted with the PvSUB1 S4 (blue) and S1 (green) sub-pockets. more precisely, the backbone of Ser-434 and Ser-436 and the side chain of Asn-464 formed three hydrogen bonds maintaining Cpd at day 0, mice were infected intraperitoneally with 2106 P. berghei-GFP blood stage parasites and received the first treatment 2 h after and then at the same hour at days 1\u20133. the mean parasitemia was determined by FACS analysis. each group was composed of a minimum of five mice. the level of inhibition observed in presence of 1 m of Cpd2 was not fully consistent with the EC50 of 370\u2013450 nm obtained by use of the classical Desjardins assay. to demonstrate that Cpd2 inhibited the endogenous PfSUB1, we monitored the processing of one of its natural substrates, SERA5 (16). treatment with 10 m E64 did not significantly inhibit SERA5 processing, although the p56 form corresponding to the last processing step deletion includes two cysteines involved in predicted di-sulfide bridges. the full-length sequence of PvSUB1-Belem displays 56.5, 55.5, and 54.7% identity to PfSUB1, PbSUB1, and PySUB1 respectively. the closer conservation of PvSUB1 to PfSUB1 was more pronounced for the enzymatic domain, with 60.3, 55, and 55.9% identity to PfSUB1, PbSUB a second processing site was identified from the N-terminal sequence of PvSUB1r-b (42 kDa), namely PPSHA(A/S)S, which is absent from PvSUB1r. a third processing generated PvSUB1r-c (39 kDa, Fig. 1A) by cleavage at the site HLA(G/S)K. this has not been reported for any other Plasmodium SUB1 the recombinant enzymatic form of PvSUB1r co-purifies with its N-terminal pro-region. this suggests strong interactions stabilize the two domains to form an holo-enzyme. proteins were produced in baculovirus-infected insect cells, HPLC-purified. the enzymatic activity of PvSUB1r, PfSUB1r, and PbSUB1r was studied with peptide substrates whose sequence corresponded to the PvSUB1 and PfSUB1 primary processing site (site a), KLVGADDVSLA and KLVSADNIDIS. both enzymes had similar Km, app for the cognate and for the heterologous substrates. vSUB1r, PfSUB1r, and PbSUB1r for synthetic substrates. the apparent Km of PvSUB1-DE, PvSUB1-FR, and PfSUB1-FR were calculated. the values are expressed in micromolars as the mean ( S.D.) of a minimum of three independent experiments. acted with PfSUB1 by immunofluorescence on P. falciparum 3D7 segmented schizonts and free merozoites (lower P. falciparum panels) producing a typical punctate pattern and showing partial superposition with the signal produced by the anti-AMA1 mAb 28G2. similar pattern was observed with air-dried P. vivax segmented schizonts (Fig. 1C) the tight superposition of 21 structures of either apo or holo of the Carlsberg subtilisin (r.m.s.d. on heavy atoms 1) confirmed the absence of significant conformational change upon ligand binding. the quality of the 50 models of PvSUB1 catalytic domain obtained with Modeler was assessed with Procheck (45), and only a few residues were identified in a disabled region of the Ramachandran diagram. solid circles represent the putative disulfide bonds involving Cys-313\u2013Cys-423 and Cys-402\u2013Cys-419. black squares indicate Ile-388, Val-383, and Asp-325 involved in the conserved calcium-binding site. the catalytic triad composed of Asp-316, His-372, and Ser-549 is shown in red. the model also contained one anti-parallel two-stranded -sheet (residues 533\u2013537 and 541\u2013545), one -helix (residues 571\u2013581) and a structural feature conserved in the subtilisin family. the model also contained one anti-parallel two-stranded -sheet (residues 533\u2013537 and 541\u2013545). several subtilisins contain one or more S\u2013S bonds in various positions that stabilize the catalytic domain (40) but the three putative disulfide bounds of PvSUB1 are absent from the seven templates used to build the three-dimensional model. the enzymatic activity of most of the subtilisins is strictly calcium-dependent. the specificity of bacterial subtilisins is mainly due to the side chain of the substrate P4 and P1 residues (40, 49) a network of hydrogen bonds between residues P4 and P1 of the substrate and those of the enzyme S4 and S1 pockets of the catalytic groove is involved in the enzyme specificity and stabilizes the enzyme-substrate interaction. in the PvSUB1 models, residues Ser-434, Gly-547, Thr-548, Ser r.m.s.d. between the 50 PvSUB1 models calculated on all atoms of the binding pocket was lower than 1, as expected from the very small deviation observed in the corresponding region of the templates. two models were selected in which the side chains of Lys-409 and Arg-412 were not pointing into the active site. this led to the choice of three PvSUB1 models that were used in the virtual screens. different structures of holo-subtilisins complexed with ligands (1LW6, 1R0R, and 2TEC) revealed that five conserved hydrogen bonds were involved in the interaction between the catalytic grooves and the bound ligands. however, a preliminary test using four of these hydrogen bonds as pharmacophore restraints was too drastic to find docking solutions. 306 selected compounds were first tested for autofluorescence at a 50 m final concentration on the PvSUB1r enzymatic assay. the 37 compounds that inhibited PvSUB1r activity by >30% entered into a secondary screen. arum-3D7 growth in vitro within the same range, namely 7.6 and 1.1 m and 30.1 and 22.3 m, respectively. Cpd2 inhibited PvSUB1r (Ki, app of 6 m) and displayed a potent anti-P. falciparum activity. EC50 of 370 and 450 nm on the chloroquine-sensitive 3D7 clone. the apparent Ki measured for PfSUB1r (5.7 m, Fig. 4B) was similar to the one observed for PvSUB1r. among the five selected compounds, Cpd2 was the only one displaying a clear, reproducible competitive inhibition of PvSUB1r. the ED50 value of Cpd2 against P. berghei could thus be estimated as 40 mg/kg, consistent with the EC50 value of Cpd2 measured on P. falciparum growth in vitro. at day 0, mice were infected intraperitoneally with 2106 P. berghei-GFP blood stage parasites. we used the recently developed inhibition of ring formation assay (19, 34) and treated highly synchronous schizont cultures with Cpd2. there was a dose-dependent inhibition of egress/invasion with >80 and 10% inhibition for 60 and 1 m respectively. treatment with 10 m E64 did not significantly inhibit SERA5 processing. this indicated that Cpd2 did inhibit the endogenous PfSUB1 activity. this obviously does not rule out inhibition of additional parasite enzymes by Cpd2. the first processing site generating PvSUB1r-a (47 kDa), thought to be the result of auto-maturation, was located at the sequence KLVGA(D/D)VSL. a second processing site was identified from the N-terminal sequence of PvSUB1r-b (42 kDa), namely PPSHA(A/S)S, which is absent from PbSUB1r (Fig. 1A). a third processing generated PvSUB1r-c (39 kDa, Fig. 1A) by cleavage at the site HLA(G/S)K. this has not been reported for any other Plasmodium SUB1 enzymes. ulovirus-infected human erythrocytes (lane 1), P. falciparum 3D7 segmented schizonts (lane 2), and in vitro maturated P. vivax segmented schizonts (lane 3) probed with anti-PvSUB1r serum. Molecular mass markers are in kDa. app was not significantly different for the two fluorophore/quencher pairs. both enzymes had similar Km, app for the cognate and for the heterologous substrates. this indicates that development of inhibitors equally effective on both enzymes is a realistic goal. we identified two bands on protein extracts from in vitro maturated P. vivax segmented schizonts. these bands migrated with an apparent molecular mass similar to that of PvSUB1r-a and PvSUB1r-b. no endogenous PvSUB1 form equivalent to PvSUB1r-c could be detected, suggesting either the latter is an artifact due to the expression in an heterologous system. bacterial subtilisin structures were constructed based on seven bacterial subtilisin structures as templates. these high resolution structures represented the best compromise in terms of resolution and sequence similarities with PfSUB1 and PvSUB1 catalytic domains. these high resolution structures represented the best compromise in terms of resolution and sequence similarities with PfSUB1 and PvSUB1 catalytic domains. vSUB1 sequence was absent from the templates. models were too large to allow reliable structure prediction. the lack of reliable information about local topologies should not affect subsequent docking studies. the residues forming the PvSUB1 catalytic groove (purple) and its substrate (light gray) are depicted in green and blue, respectively. the residues forming the S1 (green) and S4 (blue) sub-pockets are labeled in black. the PvSUB1-Belem sequence, used here as the prototypical PvSUB1, contains seven cysteine residues in positions Cys-313, Cys-402, Cys-419, Cys-423, Cys-465, Cys-478, and Cys-524. these residues form hydrogen bonds principally with the P1\u2013P4 residues of the substrate (40) the low pKa value of these groups (4) indicates that they are most likely negatively charged. electrostatic calculation shows a negative environment favorable for the binding of a cation. no clear information could be derived from the models about the positions of the weaker sites mentioned. -416, Phe-435, Ser-436, Phe-437, asp-438, and Phe-444 were predicted to form the S1 and S4 pockets, respectively. this region corresponds to the most buried part of the active site involved in substrate recognition and interaction of several subtilisins. we also included a few residues that define superficial S1\u2032 and S2\u2032 sub-pockets formed in PvSUB1. we used the FlexX, FlexX-Pharm, and ICM software packages to perform docking screens on the 149,992 pre-selected drug-like compounds. a virtual screening on the 149,992 filtered compounds was thus performed with FleX-Pharm under a pharmacophore restraint defined by the presence of two of these conserved hydrogen bonds. the resulting 149,992 compounds were used for docking on three three-dimensional models of PvSUB1 active site. the set of 306 best-scored compounds was tested for inhibition of PvSUB1r enzymatic activity at a concentration of 50 m. the 37 compounds displaying no significant autofluorescence entered a dose-response assay. d1\u20135 reproducibly displayed an apparent Ki of 50 m. the apparent Ki of the five selected compounds for PvSUB1r ranged from 30.1 to 6 m. Cpd4 and Cpd5 displayed a Ki, app value of 30.1 and 14.7 m. the apparent Ki for PvSUB1r and IC50 on the parasite growth are expressed as the mean ( S.D.) of at least three independent experiments. enzymatic assay was performed on four different concentrations of Cpd2 (50 to 0.4 m) and on five different concentrations of the PvSUB1-FR substrate ranging from 40 to 5 m. the central quinoline group was positioned between the \u2032 and \u2032\u2032 strands of the PvSUB1 catalytic groove. the indole and \u201cparamethoxyaniline\u201d moieties of Cpd2 interacted with the PvSUB1 S4 (blue) and S1 (green) sub-pockets. more precisely, the backbone of Ser-434 and Ser-436 and the side chain of Asn-464 formed three hydrogen bonds maintaining Cpd at day 0, mice were infected intraperitoneally with 2106 P. berghei-GFP blood stage parasites and received the first treatment 2 h after and then at the same hour at days 1\u20133. the mean parasitemia at day 4 ( S.E.) for each group was determined by FACS analysis. the level of inhibition observed in presence of 1 m of Cpd2 was not fully consistent with the EC50 of 370\u2013450 nm obtained by use of the classical Desjardins assay. the level of inhibition observed in presence of 1 m of Cpd2 was not fully consistent with the EC50 of 370\u2013450 nm obtained by use of the classical Desjardins assay. amino acids 417\u2013427 of PvSUB1-Belem include two cysteines involved in predicted di-sulfide bridges. this suggests a sequencing error for PvSUB1-Sal1. the full-length sequence of PvSUB1-Belem displays 56.5, 55.5, and 54.7% identity to PfSUB1, PbSUB1, and PySUB1 respectively. a second processing site was identified from the N-terminal sequence of PvSUB1r-b (42 kDa), namely PPSHA(A/S)S, which is absent from PvSUB1r. a third processing generated PvSUB1r-c (39 kDa, Fig. 1A) by cleavage at the site HLA(G/S)K. this has not been reported for any other Plasmodium SUB1 PvSUB1r-d 25-kDa pro-region starts with ADPGDIL. the recombinant enzymatic form of PvSUB1r co-purifies with its N-terminal pro-region. the recombinant enzymatic form of PvSUB1r co-purifies with its N-terminal pro-region. the enzymatic activity of PvSUB1r, PfSUB1r, and PbSUB1r was studied. the sequence corresponded to the PvSUB1 and PfSUB1 primary processing site (site a), KLVGADDVSLA and KLVSADNIDIS. both enzymes had similar Km, app for the cognate and for the heterologous substrates. apparent Km of PvSUB1r, PfSUB1r, and PbSUB1r for synthetic recombinant enzymes were calculated from the determination of the initial velocity (Vi) of the enzymatic reaction. values are expressed in micromolars as the mean ( S.D.) of a minimum of three independent experiments. clonal serum cross-reacted with PfSUB1 by immunofluorescence on P. falciparum 3D7 segmented schizonts and free merozoites (lower P. falciparum panels) producing a typical punctate pattern and showing partial superposition with the signal produced by the anti-AMA1 mAb 28G2. similar pattern was observed with air-dried P. vivax segmented schizonts. the tight superposition of 21 structures of either apo or holo of the Carlsberg subtilisin (r.m.s.d. on heavy atoms 1) confirmed the absence of significant conformational change upon ligand binding. the quality of the 50 models of PvSUB1 catalytic domain obtained with Modeler was assessed with Procheck (45), and only a few residues were identified in a disabled region of the Ramachandran diagram. solid and open circles represent the putative disulfide bonds involving Cys-313\u2013Cys-423 and Cys-402\u2013Cys-419. black squares indicate Ile-388, Val-383, and Asp-325 involved in the strong and conserved calcium-binding site. the model also contained one anti-parallel two-stranded -sheet (residues 533\u2013537 and 541\u2013545), one -helix (residues 571\u2013581) and a structural feature conserved in the subtilisin family. these strands are situated in a deep pocket that constitutes the catalytic groove of the enzyme active site. several subtilisins contain one or more S\u2013S bonds in various positions that stabilize the catalytic domain (40) but the three putative disulfide bounds of PvSUB1 are absent from the seven templates used to build the three-dimensional model. the enzymatic activity of most of the subtilisins is strictly calcium-dependent. the specificity of bacterial subtilisins is

Leu-413, Met-416, Ser-434 to Asp-438, Phe-444, Ser-461 to Cys-465, and Leu-545 to Asn-546. r.m.s.d. between the 50 PvSUB1 models calculated on all atoms of the binding pocket was lower than 1, as expected from the very small deviation observed in the corresponding region. 149,992 filtered compounds were used for docking on three three-dimensional models of PvSUB1 active site with FlexX, FlexX-Pharm, or ICM. a pharmacophore was also deduced from the known structures of subtilisins crystallized with an inhibitor. the 306 selected compounds were first tested for autofluorescence at 50 m. the 37 compounds that inhibited PvSUB1r activity by >30% entered into a secondary screen consisting of a dose-dependent assay at five concentrations. EC50 against P. falciparum-3D7 growth in vitro within the same range. Cpd2 inhibited PvSUB1r (Ki, app of 6 m) and showed a potent anti-P. falciparum activity. EC50 of 370 and 450 nm on the chloroquine-sensitive 3D7 clone. d2 (50 to 0.4 m, as indicated) and on five different concentrations of the PvSUB1-FR substrate ranging from 40 to 5 m. the apparent Ki measured for PfSUB1r (5.7 m, Fig. 4B) was similar to the one observed for PvSUB1r. parasitemia reached 5% at D4 in the group of mice treated with Cpd2. the ED50 value of Cpd2 against P. berghei could thus be estimated as 40 mg/kg, consistent with the EC50 value of Cpd2 measured on P. falciparum growth in vitro. pd2 inhibited P. falciparum merozoite egress and invasion of human erythrocytes in vitro. we used the recently developed inhibition of ring formation assay (19, 34) and treated highly synchronous schizont cultures with Cpd2. treatment with 10 m E64 did not significantly inhibit SERA5 processing, although the p56 form corresponding to the last processing step accumulated as reported by others (16). this indicated that Cpd2 did inhibit the endogenous PfSUB1 activity. this obviously does not rule out inhibition of additional parasite enzymes by Cpd2. virtual screening was performed on three different models of PvSUB1. one in which the influence of the Phe-435 side chain was abrogated by mutating this residue for an alanine. the r.m.s.d. values in the active site were below 1 in all cases. the most promising hit, Cpd2, displayed a similar affinity to both P. falciparum and P. vivax recombinant SUB1 enzymes. they behaved as a competitive inhibitor of PvSUB1 and PfSUB1. similar results have been obtained with a peptidyl -ketoamide inhibitor. Cpd2 was shown to target the endogenous P. falciparum SUB1 parasites in vitro, irrespective of their susceptibility to chloroquine, as well as against P. berghei in vivo. this study illustrates the benefit of in silico screening and provides clues on ways to improve its efficiency. among the 37 active compounds, five proved to inhibit PvSUB1 recombinant activity and P. falciparum growth in vitro. among them, five proved to inhibit PvSUB1 recombinant activity and P. falciparum growth."}
