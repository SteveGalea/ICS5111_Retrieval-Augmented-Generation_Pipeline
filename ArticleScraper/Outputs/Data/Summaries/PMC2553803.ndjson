{"summary": "pathogen detection chips currently use random primers rather than specific primers for the RT-PCR step. bias inherent in random PCR amplification becomes a serious problem that causes large inaccuracies in hybridization signals. this model predicts the amplification efficiency of a given random primer on a target viral genome. oligonucleotide microarrays have been used to detect, identify and even discover viral pathogens. a pathogen detection microarray usually contains 20\u201370 mer DNA fragments. each probe is chosen so that it is thermodynamically optimal, does not form secondary structures and hybridizes only to its target viral genome. previous research has focused on improving specific primers [13]. we build on previous paper describing the algorithm that identifies genomics sequences that can be successfully amplified by random primers. we introduce LOMA, a novel algorithm for designing efficient tagged-random primers. experiments using random priming amplification often resulted in incomplete hybridization of the pathogen genome marked by interspersed genomic regions not detected by tiling probes on the microarray. this phenomenon has also been reported by several others [17,18]. tagged random primer consists of two parts: a constant 17 bp at the 5'-end known as the 5' tag and a random oligomer (unknown base N) of length 9\u201315 at the 3'-end. the primer with the constant 17 bp sequence is used to amplify the PCR products from the first step. random primer amplification often resulted in incomplete hybridization of the pathogen genome marked by interspersed genomic regions not detected by tiling probes on the microarray. this phenomenon has also been reported by several others [17,18]. tagged random primer could be used to amplify a set of given genomes. tagged random primer could be used to predict binding affinities of a given tagged random primer to a given genome. but computing the AES for all possible tagged random primers with the given genome is impractical. LOMA (Least Occurrence Merging Algorithm) is a more deterministic and faster algorithm to generate an efficient tag for multiple genomes. the idea is to use a \"divide and conquer\" strategy to generate n-bp tags by concatenating m shorter k-mers where m = n/k. LOMA is easily extended to generate an efficient tag for multiple genomes. based on a set of genomes V, we need only to modify step one of the algorithm to compute the number of occurrences with more than 75% similarity in every genome in V. we choose the one with the highest average AES for all the genomes in V. probes with high signal intensities would give a good indication of the amount of PCR products generated across the target genome by a tagged-random primer. in each experiment involving a particular pair of RSV patient sample and random-tagged primer, hybridization signal intensities for the 1948 probes were compared to their corresponding AES along the genome. only 20% to 30% of the 1948 RSV probes had signal intensities above detection threshold when primer A1 was used. the use of primer A2 resulted in 60% to 71% of probes with signal intensities above detection threshold. an RSV patient sample was amplified separately using primer A1, primer A2 and primer A3. primer A1 performs better on HMPV than primer A1, causing only 8% of probes to be detected above threshold respectively. primers A2 and A3 performed much better than primer A1, causing >80% and > 88% of the probes to be detected above threshold respectively. the best way to obtain the most efficient tagged random primer to amplify a target genome is to compute the AES graph for all possible combinations of the 17-bp 5'end tag. a nave approach would be to randomly generate a large number of tags (eg. 10000) and choose the one that has the highest average AES with the target genome. x k-mers have no occurrence in va, ie T = 0. Suppose x k-mers have occurrences in va less than T. we generate a tag by concatenating any m of the x k-mers. the total number of tags generated is much less compared to a brute force or randomized approach. three tagged-random primers are then used to amplify the eight samples. primer A1 (5'-GTT TCC CAG TCA CGA TAN NNN NN NN-3'): Primer with highest AES among 10000 randomly generated tags. tagged-random primers are then hybridized onto our pathogen detection chip. 80% of probes with high signal intensities ( mean + 3 standarad deviation) have high AES values. 80% of probes with high signal intensities ( mean + 3 standarad deviation) showed a tremendous improvement in overall PCR efficiency in amplifying RSV over primer A1. primer A3 performs slightly better than primer A2 but both A3 and A2 perform significantly better than A1 on RSV. the results are similar to that of the first set of experiments on RSV. primers A2 and A3 amplified RSV and HMPV efficiently. compared to primer A2, primer A3 was generated in a much shorter time. this suggests it is possible to design multiple random-tagged primers to amplify a target genome. random-tagged primers LOMA generate random-tagged primers capable of amplifying their target genomes efficiently with coverage of more than 70% up to 90%. one random-tagged primer may amplify a particular region of a target genome more efficiently than another random-tagged primer. a random-tagged primer consists of random oligomers that could theoretically bind to all possible sequences. a random-tagged primer consists of random oligomers that could theoretically bind to all possible sequences. a random-tagged primer consists of random oligomers that could theoretically bind to all possible sequences. random-tagged primer generated by LOMA performs significantly better than random-tagged primers on different genomes. LOMA is able to generate good tagged-random primers much faster than randomized approaches. this is a serious oversight that may cause inaccuracies in downstream work. samples were stored at -80\u00b0C in RNAzol (Leedo Medical Laboratories, Inc., Friendswood, TX) RNA was later extracted from samples with RNAzol according to manufacturer's instructions [28,29], resuspended in RNA storage solution (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX) and frozen at -80\u00b0C until further use. a random primer instantiation pair binds to the target genome. a random primer is commonly used in virus detection experiments [20-22]. a random (forward or reverse) primer instantiation can bind to position i of va only if 9-mer of the instantiated random oligomers of the random primer is a reverse complement of the length-9 substring at position i of va. we compute Pf(i) and Pr(j) based on well-established primer design criteria. Pf(i) = 0 if the forward primer at i forms a self-dimer. Pr(j) = 0 if the reverse primer at j forms a self-dimer. RT-PCR process is performed at a certain temperature, normally 55\u00b0C\u201360\u00b0C. amplification efficiency score, AESx, can be computed by considering the combined effect of all forward and reverse primer-pairs that amplifies it. this generates a graph which indicates the regions in va predicted to be amplified efficiently by the given random primer (represented by peaks) and regions that do not (represented by troughs) random primer r1 is predicted to work better than random primer r2 if the average AES of r1 across a target genome is higher than that of r2. this implies that we can now design a tagged random primer that maximizes the amplification efficiency on a given set of target genomes. cDNA was amplified by random PCR, fragmented, end-labeled with biotin, hybridized onto the microarray and stained as previously described. signal intensities were extracted using an Axon 400b scanner and Genepix 4 software. from the seven replicates of each probe, we computed the median signal intensity of the probe. a random primer has a fixed 17-mer header and a variable 9-mer tail of the form (5'-GTT TCC CAG TCA CGA TAN NNN NN-3') this random primer is commonly used in virus detection experiments [20-22]. Let va be the actual virus in the sample. we compute Pf(i) and Pr(j) based on well-established primer design criteria [32]. the idea is that Pf(i) and Pr(j) will be small if the forward primer or reverse primer forms self-dimers or has extreme melting temperatures. a primer cannot bind to the sequence efficiently if it folds onto itself. if the 17 basepairs fixed tag of the random primer has more than 75% similarity to any subsequence of the target genome, we discard this random primer. that is, Pf(i) = 0 if the forward primer at i has a fix tag with more than 75% similarity to any subsequence of the target genome. tagged random primer would generate high AES values uniformly across target genome. tagged random primer r1 is predicted to work better than random primer r2 if the average AES of r1 across a target genome is higher than that of r2. using 3 different random-tagged primers for RT-PCR.
