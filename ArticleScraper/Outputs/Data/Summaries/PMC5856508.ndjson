{"summary": "a metapopulation model can flexibly generate patterns of spatial transmission. we used ILI+ resolved at the state level. the different states are connected by mobility flows (11) the number of random visitors traveling from state m to n is proportional to the average number of commuters between them: N n m = ( N n m + N m n ) / 2. During daytime, N n m persons move to state n and are randomly redistributed into the subpopulations there. infected individuals entering state n can be calculated as m n N n m I m / N m N n k / N n k / N n k / N n k / N n k / N n m. the random exchange of susceptible individuals can be calculated similarly. the transmission equations at nighttime are formulated similarly. the metapopulation model is integrated deterministically using the daytime equations for an interval of 1/3 d. then the nighttime equations are integrated for the subsequent 2/3 d. the number of new infections in subpopulation N n k is calculated by summing the new infections in subpopulations whose living location is k. the EAKF uses a limited number of ensemble members and is conducive for use with high-dimension systems. previous forecast work has shown that the performances of particle filters and the EAKF are similar when used to produce influenza forecasts in conjunction with a SIRS model (13). the metapopulation model estimates of these parameters, inferred using observations from all six states, are rapidly adjusted toward the truth. a reference SIRS\u2013EAKF system generates more-accurate forecasts of onset week, peak timing, and peak intensity for the synthetic truth. the metapopulation model is suitable in this study of seasonal influenza. we ran a stochastic version of the metapopulation model in synthetic tests. the remaining 15 states were excluded, as they were not well represented. forecast accuracy for onset and peak week (peak intensity) is fraction of ensemble mean predictions within 1 wk ( 25%) from the observed. a positive predicted lead indicates that onset or peak week is predicted to occur in the future, while a negative value implies that the onset or peak week is predicted to have already passed. the results indicate that the benefits of using a metapopulation system to predict onset are two-fold: (i) the number of state-season instances where an onset was predicted was larger with the metapopulation system (SI Appendix, Table S2). in Fig. 4, we show the distributions of the distance of observations from predicted values across all 35 states and five seasons. we first grouped the forecasts according to their predicted lead to onset (peak) for onset week (peak week and peak intensity) predictions from 6 wk to 1 wk. the blue bars represent metapopulation forecasts; the orange ones represent the isolated forecasts. s predicting an onset, initial low-incidence weeks can drive forecast system to erroneously predict a late onset. the isolated forecast tends to predict an outbreak peak too early in the future. for peak intensity, the isolated forecast trajectories tend to undershoot observed incidence. forecasts in each group are divided into 10 data bins with same number of forecasts. same analysis for (Middle) peak week and (Bottom) peak intensity, but grouped by the predicted lead to peak and calibrated by the ensemble predicted peak variance log transformed, log ( p e a k 2. the CDC will launch a real-time ILI forecast challenge for participating US teams. the proposed framework will be tested and evaluated in real time. we will also incorporate the metapopulation framework into the real-time forecasts of ILI+ we generate and publish at state and municipal scales. county-to-county commute data were obtained from the 2009\u20132013 American Community Surveys. the data contain both the estimated commuting population between counties and the 90% confidence interval of the estimation. the county-to-county commute data are available online at figshare. 1,000 MTFs located in 42 states in the u.s. each documented more than 30,000 total ILI-related visits. patients include both military personnel and other beneficiaries. the county-to-county commute data are deposited at figshare (doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5687503.v1)."}
