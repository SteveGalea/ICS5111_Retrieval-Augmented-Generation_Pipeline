{"summary": "all replication-competent retroviruses encode genes for three major proteins: Gag, Pol, and Env. complex retroviruses encode regulatory and accessory proteins required for efficient replication in host cell or the infected host organism. gag is synthesized on cytosolic ribosomes and is assembled as a polyprotein precursor. T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is largely independent of PI(4,5)P2. the CA domain is important for Gag-Gag interactions during virus assembly. NC is the primary nucleic acid binding domain of Gag. the illustration was adapted from checkley et al. with permission from Elsevier [23]. many studies demonstrate that the major site of HIV-1 assembly is the PM [15\u201318], although late endosomes could be a platform for virus assembly under specific conditions. retroviral Env proteins are folded and assembled into oligomers in the ER. cleavage of the retroviral Env precursor occurs at a polybasic (e.g., K/R-X-K/R-R) motif by cellular proteases. it has been suggested that AP-1 is involved in the correct sorting of HIV-1 Env from the TGN to the PM. intracellular CTLA-4-containing secretory granules are involved in the trafficking of HIV-1 Env to the PM. the subsequent trafficking of Env after the Golgi is not well understood. intracellular trafficking of Gag and Env was examined using a set of chimeric viruses between MLV and RD114 [57]. it was found that the RD114 Env was mainly localized along the secretory pathway, whereas the MLV Env was mostly localized in endosomes. subsequent work revealed that an acidic cluster in the RD114 Env CT regulates assembly of not only the RD114 Env but also the MLV Env through the interaction with retroviruses allow passive incorporation of host membrane proteins into virus particles. retroviruses allow passive incorporation of host membrane proteins into virus particles. gp41 CT can be removed without affecting incorporation of the Env into virions. polarized budding of HIV-1 in MDCK cells could also be promoted by MLV and HTLV-1 Env through their CT [108]. a stable, detergent-resistant gp41-Pr55Gag interaction was detected in immature HIV-1 virions. 41 in detergent-treated virions is dependent on the CT region. it is assumed that host cellular factors (mostly proteins) play a role in bridging Gag and Env in virus-infected cells. the 47-kDa tail-interacting protein (TIP47) has been reported to bridge Gag and Env, allowing efficient Env incorporation in HIV-1. prenylated Rab acceptor 1 (PRA1) was reported to be a binding partner for the SIV gp41 CT in a mammalian yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assay. changes in the endogenous levels of PRA1 did not affect virus production, Env incorporation, or infectivity of SIV or HIV-1. gp41 mutants that lost ability to bind p115 showed impaired replication kinetics in T-cell lines such as SupT1, H9, and Jurkat. the gp41 CT could modulate the activity of p115-RhoGEF to support virus replication. however, their roles in virus replication have not been clearly elucidated. the defect in Env incorporation caused by deletion of the gp41 CT is reversed by several MA mutations, indicating that an interaction between Env and the MA domain of Gag is required for incorporation of full-length Env into virions. more evidence for direct Gag-Env interaction comes from the finding that HIV-1 Env directs Gag budding to the basolateral surface of polarized epithelial cells through the CT of HIV-1 Env. in vitro binding between MA and a gp41 CT-GST fusion protein has been reported for both HIV-1 and SIV. a stable, detergent-resistant gp41-Pr55Gag interaction was detected in immature HIV-1 virions. however, only a couple of host factors were shown to be required for Env incorporation. mutations in either the WE motif of MA or the YW motif in the gp41 CT domain caused defects in virus replication in primary monocyte-derived macrophages. hDlg1 also binds HIV-1 Gag and the expression level of Dlg1 is inversely correlated with HIV-1 Env expression. gp41 CT mutants in which binding to Phb1/Phb2 is disrupted could replicate well in permissive cell types such as MT-4, but could not replicate efficiently in nonpermissive H9 cells. further analysis is necessary to elucidate the mechanism by which these proteins regulate virus replication through interactions with Env. gp41 CT mutants that lost the ability to bind p115 showed impaired replication kinetics in T-cell lines such as SupT1, H9 retroviruses assemble and bud from \u201cmembrane microdomains\u201d. the most well-known microdomains are \u201clipid raft(s),\u201d which are enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids [136, 137]. lipid rafts are widely thought to function as a platform for the assembly of protein complexes. the authors examined HIV-1 assembly under conditions where the Env proteins of HIV-1 and Ebola virus were coexpressed with HIV-1 Gag in the same cell [158] they found that infectious HIV-1 virions were released with both types of Env proteins. however, the virions contained either HIV-1 Env or Ebola virus glycoprotein (GP), but not both Env proteins within a single virion. et al. proposed the 'virological synapse (VS)' as a point of contact between virus-infected cells and uninfected cells. initial contact between virus-infected cells and uninfected cells occurs through gp120-CD4 binding. the cellular secretory machinery and microtubule organizing centers are polarized towards the HIV-1 assembly sites at the PM to form the VS. this paper has introduced several experimental models for retroviral Env trafficking and/or incorporation. the correct mechanism for this process is still unclear."}
