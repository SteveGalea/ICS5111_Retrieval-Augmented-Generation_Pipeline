{"summary": "antigen-binding centers of Abs are formed by hypervariable regions of heavy and light chains. immunoglobulins are expressed as receptors of the cell membrane of B lymphocytes. mAbs are secreted by identical immune cells, clones of a single parent cell. ituximab (anti-CD20) have been on the pharmaceutical market for more than 15 years. however, these and other drugs based on mAbs are not able to cure some cases of cancer in monotherapy. mAbs blocking the inhibitory signals that protect tumors from immune cells show excellent results in the treatment of particular types of tumors. the most therapeutically important cytokines in psoriasis are IL17, IL23, IL6, and TNF. the most therapeutically important cytokines in psoriasis are IL17, IL14, IL17, IL23, and others. sales of more than 50 mAbs presented on the pharmaceutical market have reached more than US$60 billion per year. market of therapeutic BsAbs approved for medical use will grow up to $5.8 billion per year by 2024. the induction of a prolonged immunoresponse after treatment is due to the affinity of fragment crystallizable region (Fc) for dendritic cells presenting the antigen. in the case of BsAbs generated by chemical hetero-conjugation, immunization occurs due to the formation of an immunoactivating environment that attract and activate dendritic cells. blinatumomab molecule directs primary CD3+ T cells against CD19+ lymphoma cells. direction of cytotoxic T lymphocytes to tumor B cells is a significant advantage of the drug. lymphocytes with chimeric CD19 receptors (CAR-T) provide complete remission in 90% of patients with refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia. in vivo such cells can proliferate up to 1,000 times. in vivo such cells can proliferate up to 1,000 times. catumaxomab redirects T cells to tumor cells, expressing EpCAM, ascites secondary to epithelial forms of cancer. the results of clinical and preclinical studies of catumaxomab have been described in detail in many reviews. catumaxomab is a trifunctional antibody that accelerates the recognition and destruction of tumor cells by different immune cells. catumaxomab binds the EpCAM on the surface of a cancer cell, CD3 on T lymphocytes, and Fc on Fc-receptor positive accessory cell. studies have shown several mechanisms of cytotoxicity: lymphocyte-mediated lysis, cytokine action (IL1, IL2, IL6, IL12, CCL18 chemokine), phagocytosis, and ab-dependent cellular toxicity. catumaxomab is approved for the treatment of malignant ascites and is currently undergoing clinical trials in ovarian, stomach, and epithelial cancer. ing site can be directed against CD19, CD20, CD33, CD123, HER1, HER2, CEA, disialoganglioside GD2, PSMA, gpA33, and other proteins. many BsAbs with other combinations of antigen-binding sites are in trials: HER2 + HER3, IL1 + IL1, IL13 + IL17, IL17A/IL17F, and CD30 + CD16A. d51 Fresenius, Trion Ertumaxomab HER2 + CD3 Breast cancer Phase II2 Fresenius FBTA05 CD20 + CD3 B-cell lymphoma Phase I/II13 Fresenius DART (dual-affinity retargeting): retargeting of T cells to tumors PF06671008 P-cadherin + CD3 Solid tumors Phase I6 MacroGenics, Pfizer angiopoietin 2 + VEGF Colorectal cancer Phase II (completed)6 Roche RG7716 Angiopoietin 2 + VEGF Wet age-related macular degeneration Phase II6 Roche CrossMAb: targeted apoptosis RG7802 CEA + CD3 Solid tumors Phase I6 Roche TandAbs: two-ligand inactivation RG7386 FAP + CD3 Non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymph inactivation of two cytokines COVA322 TNF + IL17A Plaque psoriasis Phase I/II9 Janssen, Covagen Notes: from more than 130 clinical trials of BsAbs, at least 10 were terminated. clinical trials of therapeutic bispecific antibodies Name Target Disease Reason Trial Catumaxomab EpCAM + CD3 Epithelial cancer Not provided Phase I; NCT01320020 TF2 CEA + HSG Metastatic colorectal cancer New study designed Phase I, NCT01273402 COVA322 TNF + IL17A Plaque psoriasis Safety Phase I; NCT02243787 FBTA05 CD20 + CD3 B-cell lymphoma blinatumomab and catumaxomab therapy cause different side effects. most common side effects are nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombopenia. side effects are completely reversible after the end of therapy. most frequent adverse events are cytokine release-related symptoms. most common side effects are nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and fatigue. the bispecific blinatumomab molecule has been developed using diabody technology. the first antigen-binding site is directed against a CD19 protein on the surface of B lymphocytes. the second against the CD3 receptor on the surface of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. ma with blinatumomab significantly exceeded the effect of mAb therapy at much-lower final blood concentrations. treatment of non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma patients with blinatumomab results in minimal residual disease, even after induction and consolidation. incidence of lymphocyte-release syndrome is much higher (up to 27%) than in the case of blinatumomab (up to 2%). Abs against other antigens (eg, CD79B) developed using BiTE technology directed to the treatment of myeloid leukemia and lymphoma are currently undergoing clinical trials. catumaxomab is a trifunctional antibody that accelerates the recognition and destruction of tumor cells by different immune cells. the antitumor effect of catumaxomab is due to the colocalization of a T-lymphocyte, of a tumor cell expressing EpCAM and of the cell with the Fc receptor on the surface. the interaction of patient immune cells with tumor cells leads to a complicated reaction, resulting in the elimination of tumor cells. studies have shown several mechanisms of cytotoxicity: lymphocyte-mediated lysis, cytokine cytotoxicity, phagocytosis, or antibody-dependent cellular toxicity. antitumor BsAbs undergoing clinical trials contain one anti-CD3 antigen-binding site, attracting the T lymphocyte to the tumor cell. the second antigen-binding site can be directed against CD19, CD20, CD33, CD123, HER1, HER2, CEA, disialoganglioside GD2, PSMA, gpA33, and other proteins. izumab, MT112 PSMA + CD3 Multiple myeloid leukemia Phase I51 Amgen AMG420, BI836909 BCMA + CD3 Multiple myeloma Phase I6 Amgen, Boehringer Ingelheim Quadroma, Triomab: T-cell recruitment Catumaxomab EpCAM + CD3 Malignant ascites Approved51 Fresenius, Trion Ertumaxomab HER solid tumors Phase I6 AbbVie Lutikizumab, ABT981 TNF + IL17A Rheumatoid arthritis Phase II2 AbbVie SAR156597 IL4 + IL13 Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis Phase II (completed)6 Sanofi GSK2434735 IL4 + IL4 Asthma Phase I (completed)2 GlaxoSmithKline CrossMAb: T-cell inactivation of two proteins BI1034020 A40 + A42 Alzheimer\u2019s disease Phase I6 Genentech, Novimmune IgG assembled from half-Abs: hormone mimetic BFKB8488A, RG7990 IL13 + IL17 Asthma Phase I6 Genentech, Novimmune IgG assembled from half-Abs. at least ten clinical trials of BsAbs were terminated. clinical trials of therapeutic bispecific antibodies had met primary end point Phase III; NCT02013167 Open in the u.s. clinicalTrials.gov identifiers are provided in \u201cTrial\u201d column. abbreviation: EpCAM, EpCAM, epithelial cell adhesion molecule. Figure 3. Architecture of common BsAbs formats. most common side effects during blinatumomab treatment are hepatotoxicity, leukopenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, CRP increase, chills, fever, pyrexia, nausea, and vomiting. in catumaxomab treatment, the most frequent adverse events are cytokine release-related symptoms. bispecific IgG molecules of all four subclasses are present in blood,61 placenta,62 and milk (IgG and sIgA)63,64 of healthy donors. the explosive growth of publications on BsAb generation happened in the 1980s and 1990s. pharmacological and biotechnological companies are developing new techniques for therapeutic BsAb generation. most modern BsAbs undergoing preclinical and clinical studies are classified into four formats: BiTEs, dual-affinity retargeting Abs, homodimeric \u201cknob-in-hole\u201d Abs, and trifunctional BsAbs. tetraspecific Abs binding EGFR, HER2, HER3 and VEGF are constructed by combining DVD-Ig technology with other methods. tetravalent tetraspecific Abs binding EGFR, HER2, HER3 and VEGF are constructed by combining DVD-Ig technology. ous polyclonal activated T lymphocytes were generated by surface localization of antigen-binding sites against a CD20 receptor. the drug is now undergoing clinical trials against metastatic melanoma. hexavalent construct composed of anti-CD22 and anti-CD19 BsAbs (epratuzumab, hA19) penetrates lipid rafts, stimulates apoptosis, and inhibits tumor growth. another construct containing a single-chain anti-CD3 Ab covalently bounds the antitumor Fab dimer; bispecific binding of the BsAb to tumor cells and further to T cells results in antitumor T-cell hybrid hybridoma uses two cell lines producing mAbs resistant to different antibiotics. one cell line is modified with fluorescein isothiocyanate, another with tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate.99. a variant of method using structural similarity of IgG and IgA CH3 domains ensures the formation of heterodimers of heavy chains. most widely used method of BsAb production today is expression of monospecific mAbs in two different cell lines, isolation and subsequent combination in vitro. bivalent BsAbs are small scFv molecules tandem connected by flexible peptide linkers. a disadvantage of such molecules is their short life span in blood serum. TandAb AFM13 combines antigen-binding sites against CD16A and CD30, enhancing the response of natural killers in Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. the lack of Fc increase the molecular weight and in vivo stability of these BsAbs. CVX241 BsAbs were produced by the addition of two short peptides that inhibited VEGF or angiopoietin 2 with a branched linker. however, the clinical trials of CVX241 were terminated ahead of schedule due to a lack of pharmacological effect. a hexavalent construct composed of anti-CD22 and anti-CD19 BsAbs (epratuzumab and epratuzumab) enhances the formation of immunological synapse and trogocytosis. a single-chain anti-CD3 Ab covalently bounds the antitumor Fab dimer. quadroma technology implies fusion of two cell lines producing Abs, generating a hybrid hybridoma. in such cells, heavy and light chains of two different Abs combine, resulting in BsAbs with conventional IgG-like structure. the disadvantage of this method is very low yield of target BsAbs. a variant of method using structural similarity of IgG and IgA CH3 domains ensures the formation of heterodimers of heavy chains. scFvs are widely used for generation of such BsAbs. they are expressed in one cell where fragments of heavy and light chains are connected by short peptide sequences. the first described diabodies were bivalent BsAbs. the advantages of using single-domain Ab fragments are their smallness, easy penetration into cells, and access to antigens hidden for IgG. the most successful representative of the BiTE family is blinatumomab. BsAbs against CD3 and CD20 effectively stimulated T-cell cytotoxicity against CD20+ lymphoma cell lines. the secreted Abs format is BiTE and BsAbs bind EpCAM on a tumor cell and activate CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell cytotoxicity by directing to CD3.121. anti-HIV BsAbs combine antigen-binding sites against gp41, CD4 or CCR5 protein. the ideal therapeutic BsAbs are expected to have a long half-life in human blood, distribution among organs, and sufficient penetration of tissue. using anti-HBsAg antihuman erythrocyte BsAbs allows detection of hepatitis B with 100% specificity and 97.7% sensitivity. results obtained within 2 hours of sampling, which is very competitive compared to the standard laboratory-culture method. the resulting BsAbs differ from natural IgG by pharmacokinetics, blood serum half-life, ability to penetrate tumors, size, valence, and presence of Fc. simultaneous binding of several specific antigens can play a key role."}
