{"summary": "Merck's Step study tested a replication-defective human adenovirus serotype 5 (HAdV-5) vector to deliver the HIV-1 antigens gag, pol, and nef. this trial was halted in 2007 due to statistical futility and the finding of a trend toward increased rates of HIV acquisition. in vitro studies suggest that HAdV-5 can induce 47 and CCR5 expression on expanded AdV-specific memory CD4+ T cells (7, 11), raising the possibility that HAdV-5 could have a specific effect in the mucosa. it is important to note that there are currently 65 serologically distinct human adenoviruses. rhesus macaques with adenovirus serotype 7 (SAdV-7)-based vaccine vector differentially influences peripheral and mucosal CD4+ T cell responses. both vectors heightened the cellular activation profile of total and AdV-specific CD4+ T cells specifically within the rectal mucosa. this increase in rectal mucosa CD4+ T cell activation was most pronounced after the vaccine prime. seventeen captive-bred rhesus macaques were purchased from Covance Research Products (Alice, TX) and enrolled in this study. all animals were treated and cared for at the nonhuman primate research program of the University of Pennsylvania. PBMCs were isolated from whole blood collected into heparin-containing Vacutainer tubes. cells were collected from interphase and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. PBMCs were incubated with ammonium chloride potassium lysing buffer to lyse red blood cells. cells were then washed twice in PBS and lysed. the lysate was developed with the mammalian -galactosidase assay kit for bioluminescence. the NAb titer was reported as the highest serum dilution that inhibited AdV-CMV-LacZ transduction (-gal expression) by 50% compared with the mouse serum control (catalog number S3509; Sigma) PBMCs were cryopreserved in FBS (ICS HyClone, Logan, UT) containing 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) both PBMCs and LPL cells were resuspended in complete medium. cells were split into three stimulation conditions, at a volume of 1 ml each. staining of surface markers was added to the cells and kept at room temperature for 20 min. cells were washed with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Fisher Scientific) and 0.1% sodium azide (Fisher Scientific) cells were incubated in the dark for 1 h at room temperature. group, AdV-specific T cell responses prior to immunization at baseline should reflect this appropriately. naive cells were stained with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies for CD28 and CD95. a CD14/CD20 exclusion gate provided assurance in the gating strategy. the transformation (f) used for the outcome was based on whether the outcome of interest was normally distributed, Poisson distributed, or binomial. the average differences between groups at each time point were calculated by using the Holm-Bonferroni method to preserve the overall type I error rate of 0.05. seventeen captive-bred rhesus macaques were purchased from Covance Research Products (Alice, TX) during the study. all macaques were immunized 3 times with SAdV-7 or HAdV-5 at a dose of 1 1011 particles/injection. all nonhuman primates (NHPs) were fasted the evening before the procedure. 20 biopsy specimens were taken, spaced far enough apart so as not to weaken the rectal wall. PBMCs were isolated from whole blood collected into heparin-containing Vacutainer tubes. serum-vector mixture was added to HEK 293 cells in 96-well flat-bottomed plates. cells were then washed twice in PBS and lysed, and the lysate was developed with the mammalian -galactosidase assay kit for bioluminescence. the NAb titer was reported as the highest serum dilution that inhibited AdV-CMV-LacZ transduction (-gal expression) PBMCs were cryopreserved in FBS (ICS HyClone, Logan, UT) containing 10% dimethyl sulfoxide. both PBMCs and LPL cells were resuspended in complete medium. cells were stimulated overnight at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. cells were washed with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Fisher Scientific) and 0.1% sodium azide (Fisher Scientific) cells were then washed with Perm/Wash buffer and fixed with PBS containing 1% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) FlowJo version 9.0.1 (TreeStar, Ashland, OR) shows a difference between cells stimulated with the SAdV-7 vector overnight and those left unstimulated. naive CD4+ T cells were gated by using FlowJo for each macaque. the GEE models were of the form f(outcome) = constant + group + time + group time. time was included as a categorical (rather than continuous) variable. the transformation (f) used for the outcome was based on whether the outcome of interest was normally distributed, Poisson distributed, or binomial. values from the pairwise differences comparing outcomes to each subsequent follow-up time point were adjusted by using the Holm-Bonferroni method to control for multiple comparisons. RESULTS Simian adenovirus type 7 immunity and vaccination. adenoviral vectors are known to elicit potent T cell responses to the encoded transgenes and have the potential to be an important component of a defense strategy against infectious agents such as HIV. the amino acid sequences were aligned by using ClustalW version 2.0.3. the alignment was used to construct the phylogenetic tree by using PhyML version 3.0 aLRT and rendered by using Treedyn 198.3. representatives of human adenoviruses of species A through G (serotypes in parentheses and including HAdV-5, in boldface type) and several monkey adenoviruses are shown. macaques had undetectable levels of HAdV-5 NAbs at baseline. rectal biopsy specimens and peripheral blood were collected at 2 (baseline), 2, 5, 9, 16, 19, 21, 25, 29, and 33 weeks after the first immunization. CD4+ memory T cells were excluded by gating on cells negative for the viability marker Aqua Blue. to determine the memory phenotype, we included CD28 versus CD95 cells. activation markers (CD25, CD69, HLA-DR, and Ki67) were gated. cytokines (IL-2, TNF-, and IFN-) were analyzed. all gating is shown for rectal lamina propria lymphocytes. we found no statistically significant correlation between baseline AdV-specific CD4+ T cell responses and preexisting baseline SAdV-7-specific NAbs in PBMCs or rLPLs. the magnitude of the response was consistently higher in the rectal mucosa, with 4 macaques exhibiting >1% expression in rLPLs. 0.139% was the highest cytokine response in PBMCs. significance at any time point was calculated as the percent increase relative to the baseline value. animals with no rectal biopsy data at the baseline time point. no association between the peak of the AdV-specific CD4+ T cell response and preexisting AdV NAbs was found in blood or in HAdV-5-vaccinated macaques. rLPLs that were stimulated with the SAdV-7 vector were predominantly central memory CD4+ T cells (CD28+ CD95+), while PBMCs were a mix of naive (CD28+ CD95+) and central memory phenotypes. these results indicate that there are preexisting AdV-specific T cell responses in both the peripheral blood and rectal mucosa. rLPLs of unstimulated cells of SAdV-7-vaccinated macaques had highest expression levels of activation markers on memory CD4+ T cells compared to the blood or HAdV-5-vaccinated macaques. increased activation marker expression on total unstimulated memory CD4+ T cells in rectal mucosa after AdV vector vaccination. shown are percentages of total unstimulated memory CD4+ T cells expressing at least one of four activ cells are from the same rhesus macaques and time points as those in Fig. 5. animals with no rectal biopsy data at the baseline time point. rectal CD4+ T cell activation in unstimulated cells increased. -specific activation averaged consistently above 1.49-fold (SAdV-7 vaccinated) and 1.18-fold (HAdV-5 vaccinated) during weeks 2 to 16. increased activation levels of resting and SAdV-7-specific memory CD4+ T cells. increased frequency of rectal mucosa naive CD4+ T cells after adenovirus vector vaccination. there was no evidence for an association between baseline SAdV-7 NAb titers and percentages of naive CD4+ T cells over time. no such overall decrease was noted for naive rLPL CD4+ T cells after HAdV-5 vaccination in the control animals. prior exposure to adenoviruses in vaccinees can result in a memory response to the payload adenoviral capsid antigens (20) this response is likely to be strongly influenced by the epitopes that are shared between capsid antigens present in the adenoviral vaccine and the epitopes in adenoviruses. this response is likely to be strongly influenced by the epitopes that are shared between capsid antigens representatives of human adenoviruses of species A through G (serotypes in parentheses and including HAdV-5, in boldface type) and several monkey adenoviruses are seen to belong to a phylogenetically distinct group (gray box) as a control, we vaccinated 12 rhesus macaques three times intramuscularly with 1 1011 virus particles (VP) of an E1-deleted, replication an LPL sample from week 21 (macaque 04C058) and a peripheral blood sample from week 2 (baseline) were unable to be processed. cells were stained for multiple markers, with a particular focus on memory markers (CD28 and CD95), activation markers (HLA-DR, CD25, CD69, and Ki67) adenovirus-specific CD4+ T cells expand postvaccination. adenovirus-specific CD4+ T cells expand postvaccination. gating is shown for rectal lamina propria lymphocytes. we assessed cytokine expression on memory CD4+ T cells after stimulation with either SEB or SAdV-7 (or no stimulation) in rectal lamina propria lymphocytes (rLPLs) and peripheral blood (PBMCs) from vaccinated macaques. cells from HAdV-5-vaccinated animals were stimulated with SAdV-7 to determine whether vaccination boosted cross-reactive responses against the heterologous SAdV-7 vector. 0 to 1.26% for SAdV-7 and 0 to 1.5% for HAdV-5. 0.139% was the highest cytokine response in PBMCs. levels of IL-2, IFN-, and TNF- production were measured. we found a general association between the peak of the AdV-specific CD4+ T cell response and preexisting AdV NAb titers in the rLPLs of SAdV-7-vaccinated macaques. the highest SAdV-7-specific cytokine responses were seen in the rLPLs of SAdV-7-vaccinated macaques, peaking at 14.42% (macaque 04C058) and 16.84% (macaque 04C results indicate that there are preexisting AdV-specific T cell responses in both the peripheral blood and rectal mucosa. peak mucosal responses are at least 3-fold higher on average than those seen in peripheral blood. adenovirus vector vaccination increases the frequency of activated memory CD4+ T cells in the rectal mucosa. increased activation marker expression on total unstimulated memory CD4+ T cells in rectal mucosa after AdV vector vaccination. shown are percentages of total unstimulated memory CD4+ T cells expressing at least one of four activation markers (HLA-DR, CD25, Ki67, and CD69). cells are from the same rhesus macaques and time points as those in Fig. 5, with same statistical significance. macaques maintained heightened activation for several weeks, peaking at 1.5-fold group average increase from baseline at week 16. one macaque (macaque 05D079) reached nearly 40% total activated CD4+ memory T cells at week 2. increased frequency of rectal mucosa naive CD4+ T cells after adenovirus vector vaccination. increased frequency of rectal mucosa naive CD4+ T cells in the rectal mucosa. increased frequency of rectal mucosa naive CD4+ T cells after vaccination. naive CD4+ T cells stimulated overnight with whole SAdV-7 vector. naive indicates CD28+ CD95+ cells, effector memory indicates CD28+ CD95+ cells, and effector memory indicates CD28 CD95+ cells. step and Phambili studies were able to generate HIV-specific T cell immunogenicity in many participants. the HAdV-5 vaccine is unable to elicit a sufficiently broad immune response to counteract HIV-1 strain diversity or that the AdV vector induced a response that was of an altered, undesirable quality (5, 27) adenovirus presence (18, 28) is a driver for T cell migration to the gut, possibly increasing the population of activated T cells for SIV to infect. non-adenovirus-specific CD4+ T cells express differential levels of these markers after vaccination. priming with the SAdV-7 vector decreased the percentage of naive CD4+ T cells in the rectal lamina propria, but not in blood, prior to boosting. these findings emphasize the value of sampling from mucosal sites in the context of vaccination with putative HIV vaccine platforms. human intestinal tissue, particularly intestinal lymphocytes, can often be found to harbor adenoviral DNA (22) and captive macaques are chronically infected by adenoviruses (15). replication-defective HAdV-5 vectors can persist for over a year in mice (8, 32), potentially resulting in prolonged antigen presentation and stimulation. we did not find an association between preexisting SAdV-7 NAbs and increased CD4+ T cell mucosal activation in this study. it is possible that other macaque AdV strains could be stimulating the immune system and influencing the expression of activation markers. vaccination with both endogenous macaques as well as human adenoviral vectors can lead to significant increases in the frequencies of AdV-specific and activated CD4+ T cells in the rectal lamina propria of macaques but not in the peripheral blood. previous adenovirus vaccine platform studies have not indicated an increase in SIV susceptibility, but importantly, adenovirus vaccination might indeed create such an environment."}
