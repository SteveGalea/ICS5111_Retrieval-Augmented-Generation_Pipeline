{"summary": "method for deriving thresholds proposed in an influenza surveillance manual published by the world health organization (WHO) Methods For 2002-2011, we analysed two routine influenza-like-illness datasets, general practice sentinel surveillance and a locum medical service sentinel surveillance. for each sentinel dataset, we created two composite variables from the product of weekly ILI data. influenza outbreaks usually occur between late autumn and early spring. the onset, duration and severity of a season may differ from year to year. thresholds have been developed to indicate a level of disease activity that would signal the start or end of a season. thresholds may inform appropriate allocation of resources. the general practice Sentinel Surveillance (GPSS) for ILI has historically relied on thresholds determined by inspection. the proposed method aligns several years of historical data on the median week of peak activity and assigns thresholds based on means and standard deviations. the aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of the WHO method for the calculation of influenza thresholds. the GPSS is an annual surveillance system for ILI and laboratory confirmed influenza. the number of participating general practitioners (GP) has varied from 40 to 100. the number of participating general practitioners (GP) has varied from 40 to 100 since the scheme\u2019s establishment. the clinical information coded for each episode of care is based on the ICD-10-AM. we extracted records containing influenza codes J09-11 in primary or secondary diagnostic fields. a further two composite variables were created from the product of ILI and LAB data. both MMDS and routine VIDRL clinical testing focus on older age groups. the WHO manual did not prescribe a specific method for determining the seasonal threshold, that is, the start of the season. for each dataset this was done independently by four of the co-authors (ET, KG, AM, HK) we tested the thresholds using the median and 90th and 95th percentiles. the average threshold was determined by a comparison of peak weekly mean and median. the alert threshold was determined by a comparison of the peak weekly upper 90% and 95% CI upper limits with the 90th and 95th percentiles. Victoria has a temperate climate with annual seasons of influenza occurring between late autumn (May) and early spring (October) it has a well-established influenza surveillance system that monitors influenza activity using syndromic surveillance of ILI presentations to sentinel general practitioners (GP) and a medical locum service. it has a well-established influenza surveillance system that monitors influenza activity using syndromic surveillance of ILI presentations. LAB data from VIDRL consist of laboratory detections of influenza viruses from all routine respiratory samples sent to VIDRL. adenovirus, picornavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, coronavirus and human metapneumovirus. weekly GPSS ILI proportion per 1000; weekly MMDS ILI per 1000; weekly proportion of influenza admissions in the population using the total number of tests for influenza as the denominator. we preferred the use of test positive influenza to count data to compensate for changes in testing behaviour over time [33] we then compared the seasonal threshold set by inspection with the 95% CI and 95th percentiles of the average out-of-season values. we then aligned the transmission peaks around the median week of peak occurrence (Figure 1A) and calculated the weekly mean and standard deviations for each week centred on the median week of peak occurrence (Figure 1B and C). the highest number of ILI or influenza cases annually ranged from 56 to 208 per week for the GPSS; 33 to 164 per week for the MMDS; 24 to 135 per week for test positive influenza; and 28 to 204 per week for influenza admissions. the threshold parameters from the adapted WHO method are summarised in Table 1. the values assigned for seasonal thresholds by inspection were similar to the 95% CI upper limit and 95th percentile of the average out-of-season values for all datasets. the peak mean values for the GPSS, test positive influenza and VAED were similar to the median but the peak mean was higher for the MMDS and MMDS composite due to the high call out proportion in 2003. we therefore use the peak mean to define the average threshold (Table 1). 24.6 5.5 4.8 1.4 90th percentile 24.1 55.0 35.0 11.2 17.5 2.0 95th percentile 22.6 79.6 36.1 12.9 21.1 2.1 Threshold levels Categories of influenza season Threshold values Seasonal 4.0 10.0 5.0 1.5 1.0 0.3 Seasonal - Average 4.0-15.0 10.0-15.0-10.0-35.0 5.0-27.0 1.5-6.5 1.0-8.5 0.3-1.3 Average - Alert >15.0 - 24.0 >3 set / End (duration) GPSS Onset / End (duration) MMDS Onset / End (duration) Test positive Influenza Onset / End (duration) MMDS Composite Onset / End (duration) Onset and duration of seasons 2005 25/36 (12) 22/36 (15) 21/40 (20) 20/36 (17) 22/35 (14) 21/36 (16) 2006 25/36 (12) 21/36 (16) 20/35 (16) 21/38 a divergent trend, not reflected in other datasets, was noted in the VAED from 2009 onwards. the VAED assigned seasons ended much later, resulting in a longer assigned seasonal duration. the season intensity varied according to different data sources. the highest number of ILI or influenza cases annually ranged from 56 to 208 per week for the GPSS; 33 to 164 per week for the MMDS; 24 to 135 per week for test positive influenza. testing for normality of the weekly count data for each year suggested no seasonal surveillance data had a classical Normal distribution graphically. data were consistent with a Normal distribution by formal testing for 5/10 seasons in the GPSS, for 5/10 seasons in the MMDS, for 2/9 seasons in LAB ED Seasonal Threshold Seasonal threshold (inspection) 4.0 10.0 5.0 1.5 1.0 0.3 95% CI (out of season) 4.3 10.2 4.5 1.4 1.4 0.7 0.3 95th percentile (out of season) 3.9 9.7 4.4 1.4 0.7 0.3 Average and Alert Thresholds Median week of peak occurrence 34 34 34 34 34 34.5 35 Range (weeks) 24-40 26-37 27-44 30-39 25-41 29 annual data (red) plotted against the ten year average season (black) for the GPSS, 2002-2011. season onset according to the VAED generally lagged behind other datasets for most years and was variable for the MMDS (Table 2). a divergent trend, not reflected in other datasets, was noted in the VAED from 2009 onwards. the VAED assigned seasons ended much later, resulting in a longer assigned seasonal duration. a divergent trend was noted in the VAED from 2009 onwards.
