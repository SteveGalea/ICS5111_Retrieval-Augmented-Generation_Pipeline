{"summary": "asthma is the most common chronic disease in childhood. in the united states, nearly 60% have one or more acute exacerbations each year [2, 3], and up to 20% require ED visits annually. pediatric asthma has different patterns according to the children's age. in the preschoolers, acute wheeze is often induced by infections of the lower airways. in the school-aged children (6 years and older) it usually signifies underlying asthma [6] and allergy. two more nurses are available for the ED patients and 1 for the short-stay observation. a white code means that the condition is not relevant or does not have an acute onset and is not affecting the vital signs. a yellow code means that the condition is life-threatening (vital functions are compromised) and the patient requires immediate evaluation. age and sex of the patient, month of the visit, triage colour tag, acute asthma severity. if no overt cause could be ascertained, the etiology was classified as \u201cunknown\u201d. not all signs are needed for defining the severity of an exacerbation. a descriptive analysis was performed for continuous variables (median, 25th and 75th percentiles) the data were collected in a Microsoft Excel\u00ae database. the association between qualitative variables was evaluated. n = 206 2 years; n = 253 2 years and 6 years. n = 144; 24%) were school-aged children and adolescents. 603 patients aged 0\u201314 years were visited for acute asthma. 94 patients (15.6%) were given white colour tag, 282 (46.8%) green, 225 (37.3%) yellow, and 2 (0.3%) red. severity of the episode was mild in 340 cases (56%), moderate in 237 (39%), and severe in 26 (4%), while none of the episodes was classified as life-threatening. one hundred ninety-one patients (31%) had a previous history of asthma or wheezing bronchitis. most had a mild exacerbation (n = 110; 57%) and 69 (36%) moderate. only 12 (6%) presented a severe asthma attack. the proportion of visits for asthma that we describe is similar to that reported by Nath and Hsia in 2015. most patients were males and preschool-aged children. the severity was most often judged as mild or moderate. one-third of children aged 6 or more had an asthma exacerbation induced by an allergic trigger. in 10% the etiology could not be made out during the ED visit. 4.2. seasonal cycles of asthma exacerbations is well established. a history of acute asthma crises in the previous season or year was shown to be a risk factor for new exacerbations in 400 asthmatic patients aged 6\u201320 years [19]. a history of acute asthma crises in the previous season or year was shown to be a risk factor for new exacerbations in 400 asthmatic patients aged 6\u201320 years [19]. controller medications are indicated in children with persistent asthma. the correct use of controller medications has been shown to reduce exacerbations and thereby ED visits for asthma. a study on 3435 ED visits for asthma in children showed that patients with acute asthma exacerbation are at high risk for future episodes. the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has extended the recommendation also for pneumococcal vaccination to asthmatic children and adolescents aged 6\u201318 years. specific allergen-avoidance measures should also be addressed to all sensitized patients, for example, removing furry animals from the house in case of pet dander allergy. a personalized written action plan, meaning a document explaining how to deal with the condition, is widely accepted as good practice in asthma education and self-management. respiratory tract infections are the most common trigger for asthma exacerbations in preschool- and school-aged children. one-third of children aged 6 or more had an asthma exacerbation induced by an allergic trigger. in 10% the etiology could not be made out during the ED visit. the peak of this \u201cSeptember asthma epidemics\u201d is around 2 weeks after the start of school. in children aged 2\u20134, the pattern was similar but the peak less striking [16] Cohen et al. analyzed data from 82234 asthmatic children. a history of acute asthma crises in the previous season or year was shown to be a risk factor for new exacerbations in 400 asthmatic patients aged 6\u201320 years. a history of acute asthma crises in the previous season or year was shown to be a risk factor for new exacerbations in 400 asthmatic patients. patients with acute asthma exacerbation are at high risk for future episodes. a study on 3435 ED visits for asthma in children showed that only 18% had a prescription for inhaled corticosteroids in the 2 months following the ED visit. however, the rates of such prescriptions are low. a personalized written action plan is widely accepted as good practice in asthma education and self-management. it can improve outcomes such as self-efficacy, knowledge, and confidence for people with asthma. in those who have had a recent exacerbation, it may reduce readmission rates. individualized written action plans should always be available. recommending vaccinations and allergen-avoidance measures might be useful. authors declare they have no conflicts of interest."}
