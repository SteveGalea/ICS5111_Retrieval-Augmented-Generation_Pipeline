{"summary": "a recombinant native full-length S-protein trimer (triSpike) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was readily cleaved in vitro by three different airway proteases. arginine residues (R667 and R797) were potential protease cleavage sites. ACE2 binding has direct implications for the cell entry mechanism of SARS-CoV along the respiratory system. proteolytic cleavage of viral envelope glycoprotein into a receptor binding and a fusogenic transmembrane subunit is important to regulate virus entry and infectivity. TMPRSS11a, one of the newly identified members of type II transmembrane serine proteases, is expressed in upper respiratory tract (pharynx and trachea) but less is known about TMPRSS that activate pneumotropic virus under natural infection. the precise role of trypsin during coronavirus infection is still unknown. sytia formation was observed between SARS spike glycoprotein expressing 293T cells and VeroE6 cells after brief trypsin treatment. trypsin has been shown to induce cleavage of monobasic cleavage site. it is not known whether the functionality of spike glycoproteins is dependent on the activity of trypsin inducing their proteolytic cleavage. one of the two natural cleavage sites described here, at position 797, was reported in a separate independent study using only trypsin for cleavage [27]. this study further supports and strengthens the demonstration of the critical role of receptor-dependent cleavage of spike protein by airway proteases. the susceptibility to SARS-CoV mediated infection correlated well with ACE2 expression. ACE2 expression was detected by RT-PCR only in 16HBE and VeroE6 but not in A549 and BEAS-2B cells. protease cleavage on purified triSpike protein was performed by treating the triSpike protein with airway proteases followed by amino acid sequence analyses. results indicated that different airway proteases recognize amino acid residues of Spike as cleavage sites. onaviruses surface glycoproteins into S1 and S2 subunits is important to activate the fusion between the viral envelope and the cellular membrane during virus entry step [18], [21], cleavage by trypsin, plasmin and TMPRSS11a proteases. this site, which lies within the S2 subunit region, could be important for its further rearrangement. red dots represent the basic amino acids, potential protease cleavage sites. red dots represent the basic amino acids, potential protease cleavage sites. experiments performed in triplicates and values expressed as meansSE from two independent experiments. SARS-CoVpp entry into susceptible cell lines enhanced with presence of airway proteases. unbound SARS-CoVpp or empp was washed away and proteases were added. the enhancement of SARS-CoVpp entry increased with higher concentration of the proteases. three mutant constructs were made from the wild-type SARS-CoV Spike glycoprotein cDNA cloned in the vector pcDNA3.1. pseudotypes were collected from 293T cells 48 h post transfection. samples (cell lysates or pseduotypes) were denatured, reduced and analyzed by 4\u201312% Bis-Tris SDS-PAGE gel and Western Blot. double mutation (R797AR667A) plasmids exhibited reduced levels of complex-sugar linked envelope expression in the cell lysates. lysates suggest that envelope protein expression and post-translational modifications have not been significantly affected by any of the substitutions. lysates suggest that the double mutation could have affected proper folding and oligomerization. the single mutants (R667A and R797AR667A) exhibited differential patterns of envelope glycoprotein incorporation into pseudotypes. both constructs showed a band pattern similar to that of wild-type, suggesting that the envelope glycoprotein was expressed in transfected cells. however, only R667A was detected in purified pseudotypes. arginine residue at position 667 is sensitive to airway protease cleavage. airway proteases could cleave the SARS spike glycoprotein following the virus-cell attachment stage, thereby enhancing SARS-CoV entry into human ACE2-expressing airway epithelial cells. recombinant viruses encoding the luciferase reporter gene and expressing the SARS-CoV Spike glycoprotein at the virion surface have been shown to faithfully mimic the SARS-CoV entry process. only 16HBE cells (human bronchial epithelial cells) were efficiently infected by SARS-CoVpp. luciferase activity expressed as luminescence counts per second (LCPS) luciferase activity expressed as luminescence counts per second was measured. all experiments were performed in triplicates and data are presented as meansSE of two or three independent experiments. trypsin, plasmin and TMPRSS11a proteases cleave the Spike glycoprotein at positions 667 and 797. amino acid residue 667 is also sensitive to cleavage by trypsin, plasmin and TMPRSS11a proteases. amino acid residue 797 is also sensitive to cleavage by trypsin, plasmin and TMPRSS11a proteases. purified triSpike proteins were incubated with 0.2 mU of trypsin (lane 3), plasmin (lane 4) or TMPRSS11a (lane 5) identified and purified. three different types of airway proteases (trypsin, plasmin and TMPRSS11a) utilize the same amino acid residues for protein cleavage. proteolytic cleavage of Spike protein before virus attachment to cells had no enhancing effects on virus entry. protease treatment digested out the S1 region which is crucial for ACE2 binding, thus resulting in reduced infectivity of SARS-CoVpp. 16HBE cells were incubated with various concentrations of trypsin (T), plasmin (P) or TMPRSS11a (N) at room temperature for 40 min. unbound SARS-CoVpp or empp was washed away and proteases were added. multiple sequence alignments were done on different isolates of the SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein to locate the airway protease cleavage sites. the potential airway protease cleavage motif is relatively conserved between the various isolates with over 90% sequence identity. mutant and wild-type envelope proteins were incubated with 16HBE cells. transduction was measured by determination of the luciferase activity (LCPS) expression of wild-type and mutant envelope proteins in transfected cells was tested by Western blot analysis. co-transfected foreign proteins into bona fide pseudoparticles was tested. the wild-type pseudotypes expressed the envelope glycoprotein as a single band. the double mutant (R797AR667A) showed a complete lack of pseudotype incorporation of envelope glycoprotein. however, only R667A was detected in purified pseudotypes. 16HBE cells were pre-incubated with wild-type (SARS-CoVpp) or mutant (R667App) pseudotypes on ice, which allowed virus attachment but not entry. unbound pseudotypes were washed away and proteases were added. asterisk (*) indicates a value of p0.05 and (**) indicates a value of p0.01 in two-tailed t tests. the spike glycoproteins of many enveloped viruses are cleaved by host-derived proteases into two non-covalently linked subunits [5], [36], [37]. ACE2 expression on epithelial cell was found to correlate with cellular differentiation. 16HBE and BEAS-2B cells are derived from human bronchial epithelium. ACE2 expression on epithelial cell was found to correlate with levels of cellular differentiation. a new study has demonstrated the incorporation of a similar mutant construct into a murine leukemia virus-based pseudotyping vector. the difference in mutant envelope incorporation with respect to our study might be attributed to the greater hydrophobicity of our substituted amino acid, which disrupts the oligomerization process. wild-type SARS spike has no putative furin cleavage motif/site. however, a number of extracellular airway proteases are secreted by the airway epithelium. this modification enables the formation of a cleaved form of spike. enhancing effect of airway proteases on SARS-CoVpp entry is strictly dependent on the virus-cell attachment step. cleavage of envelope glycoprotein on virion surface, before binding to its cellular receptor, is necessary for entry and fusion process [18], [21]. ases with SARS-CoV along the respiratory tract supports the positive feedback loop of virus infection in vivo. cleavage of the receptor-bound spike glycoprotein by airway proteases enhances in vitro virus entry and fusion. reagents that suppress in vivo activity of airway proteases might provide additional antiviral strategy against SARS-CoV.
