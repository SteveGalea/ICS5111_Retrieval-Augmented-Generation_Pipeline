CD44hi Kb/OVA257 tetramer+ (OVA257+) in live splenic CD8+ T cells. IL-7R expression in live splenic OVA257+ Teff (dark gray), or OVA257+ Te only mice with significant levels of each OVA257+ T memory subset of interest were included in the analysis. n.s., non-significant; *p 0.05, **p 0.01, ***p 0.001, and ****p 0.0001 (A\u2013D, two-way ANOVA/Sidak\u2019s test; E, repeated-measure (RM) one-way ANOVA/Sidak\u2019s test) immunization in the presence of CD4+ T cell help, bore an even higher level of IL-7R. a key property of memory CD8+ T cells is their capacity to rapidly perform multiple effector functions, including the production of various effector cytokines. representative dot plots for IL-2 and TNF- expression in live splenic CD8+ T cells. only mice with significant levels of OVA257+ memory T cells in the spleen were included in this analysis. the ability of a given rAAV serotype to efficiently transduce DCs in vivo has been brought forward as a key limiting factor for rAAV vectors in inducing potent CTL responses. this paradigm has mostly been derived from intramuscular or intraperitoneal immunizations, and might not fully reflect known differences in peripheral tissues\u2019 DC networks. male (B) or female (C) mice were immunized in the tibialis anterior (i.m.) or ear dermis (i.d.) with 3 1010 vg rAAV2/1-mOVA-HY (mOVA-HY), rAAV2/1-mOVA-HY-miR142-3pT (mOVA-HY-miR), or a control rAAV2/1 vector (Ctr miR142-3p-regulated rAAV2/1-mOVA-HY construct did lead to a reduced CD8+ T cell response. similar CD8+ T cell responses were observed for both constructs. direct priming by DCs is dispensable for induction of strong CD8+ T cell responses. cross-presentation of skin-targeted anti-OVA memory CD8+ T cell responses were analyzed between day 60 and day 80 post-immunization in the spleen or dLNs of male or female mice immunized in the tibialis anterior (i.m.) or ear dermis (i.d.) n.s., non-significant; *p 0.05, **p 0.01, ***p 0.001, and ****p 0.0001. the protective potential of anti-OVA memory CD8+ T cells induced by the sole cross-presentation of tissue-expressed rAAV transgene was analyzed at day 60 after primary immunization by challenging i.p. with 106 CFUs OVA-expressing recombinant Listeria monocytogenes (L we challenged mice intraperitoneally (i.p.) with lethal doses of 106 colony-forming units (CFUs) of recombinant Listeria monocytogenes (Lm-OVA) mice previously immunized with a control rAAV2/1 vector gradually lost weight up to day 3 post-infection. intradermal cross-priming induced by a single rAAV2/1-mOVA-HY-miR immun differences in cross-priming could result from enhanced tissue-expressed transgene cross-presentation or local environmental cues enhancing T cell priming. in mice immunized with rAAV2/1-mOVA-HY via intramuscular route, robust activation of transgenic OT-1 CD8+ T cells was detected by day 5. no clear transgene expression could be detected at this time point in any of the DC subpopulations sorted from the injected tibiali miR142-3p-regulated OVA transgene appeared solely presented by migratory DCs in both skin and muscle-draining lymph nodes. presentation in the latter mostly restricted to the CD103+ subset. male mice were immunized in the tibialis anterior (i.m.) or in the ear dermis (i.d.) data are pooled from three independent experiments for all DC subsets. for each experiment, organs from n = 3 immunized mice per group were pooled prior to DC sort. the CD103+ migratory DC subset only accounted for less than 10% of all DCs in both skin and muscle-draining lymph nodes at this time point. MHC class I presentation of skin-targeted OVA transgene was equally effective at all doses studied. male or female mice were immunized in the tibialis anterior (i.m.) with 1010 vg rAAV2/1-mOVA-HY or rAAV2/1-mOVA-HY-miR142-3pT (A\u2013C), in the ear dermis (i.d.) with 1010 vg mean SEM (A, n = 3\u20136 mice per group and per time point) pooled from at least two independent experiments. B, n = 3\u20136 mice per group and per time point pooled from two independent experiments. rAAV2/1 construct induces strong OVA257-specific CD8+ T cell and DBY608-specific CD4+ T cell responses in female mice. male mice respond similarly to CD4-depleted female mice in this setting. male or male mice were immunized in the ear dermis (i.d.) male mice were immunized in the tibialis anterior (i.m.) or the ear dermis (i.d.) with 3 1010 vg rAAV2/1-mOVA-HY (mOVA-HY) female mice were immunized in the ear dermis (i.d.) with 5 1010 vg rAAV2/1-mOVA-HY (mOVA-HY) a strong effector OVA257-specific CD8+ T cell response could be observed in the blood and spleen of intradermally immunized female mice. CD8+ T cell infiltration could further be observed in the dermis and epidermis of injected ears. these results thus highlight the skin as a suitable target organ for vaccination with rAAV2/1-based vaccines. no significant population of central memory CD8+ T cells could be detected in the lymphoid organs of most of the intramuscularly immunized mice. however, simply adding CD4+ T cell help (female intramuscular versus male intramuscular) did not lead to an increased generation of central memory (Tcm) and effector memory (Tem) CD8+ T cells. male or female mice immunized in the tibialis anterior (i.m.) or ear dermis (i.d.) with 3 1010 vg rAAV2/1-mOVA-HY (mOVA-HY) IL-7R expression is represented as the ratio of the indicated cell population MedianFI over the MedianFI of the endogenous naive CD8+ T cell population of the same individual. only mice with significant levels of each OVA257+ T memory subset of interest were included in the analysis. intradermal immunization in the presence of CD4+ T cell help had little to no impact. the cytokine production potential of anti-OVA memory CD8+ T cell responses was analyzed between day 60 and day 80 post-immunization. representative dot plots for IL-2 and TNF- expression in live splenic CD8+ cells. only mice with significant levels of OVA257+ memory T cells in the spleen were included in this analysis. the ability of a given rAAV serotype to efficiently transduce DCs in vivo has been brought forward as a key limiting factor for rAAV vectors in inducing potent CTL responses. the ability of a given rAAV serotype to efficiently transduce DCs in vivo has been brought forward as a key limiting factor for rAAV vectors. male (B) or female (C) mice were immunized in the tibialis anterior (i.m.) or ear dermis (i.d.) with 3 1010 vg rAAV2/1-mOVA-HY (mOVA-HY), rAAV2/1-mOVA-HY-miR142-3pT (mOVA-HY-miR), or a control rAAV2/1 vector (Ctr intramuscular immunization with an miR142-3p-regulated rAAV2/1-mOVA-HY construct did lead to a reduced CD8+ T cell response. similar CD8+ T cell responses were observed for both constructs following intradermal immunization. after intramuscular immunization CD4+ T cell help alone was insufficient to restore maximum CTL polyfunctionality against an miR142-3p-regulated transgene. anti-OVA memory CD8+ T cell responses were analyzed between day 60 and day 80 post-immunization in the spleen or dLNs of male or female mice. peptide (1 g/mL) in vitro re-stimulation of splenic cell suspensions. mean SEM (n = 9 mice for the male mOVA-HY-miR i.d. group, n = 10 mice per group for all other groups, pooled from at least three independent experiments) mice previously immunized with a control rAAV2/1 vector gradually lost weight up to day 3 post-infection. intradermal cross-priming induced by a single rAAV2/1-mOVA-HY-miR immunization was sufficient to achieve clear protection. weight loss was curtailed by day 2 and complete clearance of the bacterial load by day 3 in 90% of analyzed female mice. target Tissue Dictates the Efficiency of Tissue-Expressed Transgene Cross-Presentation. differences in cross-priming could result from enhanced tissue-expressed transgene cross-presentation or local environmental cues enhancing T cell priming. we next aimed at directly monitoring cross-presentation events in vivo. rAAV2/1-mOVA-HY (A\u2013E) or rAAV2/1-mOVA-HY-miR142-3pT vector (C and E) showed strong presentation from migratory lymph nodes in both skin and muscle-draining lymph nodes. rAAV2/1-mOVA-HY (A\u2013E) or rAAV2/1-mOVA-HY (miR142-3pT vector (C and E) r culture with 2 103 DCs, and (E) frequencies of divided cells in live CD8+VPD+OT-1 after 64-hr culture with the indicated number of DCs are shown. dots in graphs correspond to one experiment. n = 3 immunized mice per group were pooled prior to DC sort. MHC class I presentation of skin-targeted OVA transgene was equally effective at all doses studied. male or female mice were immunized in the tibialis anterior (i.m.) with 1010 vg rAAV2/1-mOVA-HY or rAAV2/1-mOVA-HY-miR142-3pT (A\u2013C), in the ear dermis (i.d.) with 1010 vg VPD+OT-1 T cells recovered from ear draining lymph nodes 18 hr after day 5 OT-1 transfer. mean SEM (A, n = 3\u20136 mice per group and per time point) n = 3 mice per group from one experiment only, except for day 7.5 and 9. our results exemplify a previously unappreciated synergy between CD4+ T cell help and skin targeting in regulating optimal differentiation of anti-transgene CTL memory. of outmost interest for rAAV vaccines, our results further demonstrate a strong requirement for transgene cross-presentation in the context of intramuscular, but not intradermal, immunization. the exact nature of the mechanism(s) driving memory CD8+ T cell differentiation following intradermal immunization with rAAV vectors. a number of mechanisms have been considered so far to explain the limited induction of potent anti-transgene memory CD8+ T cells following intradermal immunization with rAAV vectors. intradermal immunization appeared independent of transgene expression in hematopoietic cells. targeting the skin was indeed associated with a better long-term clearance of the transgene. differences in environmental cues41, 42, 43 or DC subsets44 are among the numerous mechanisms already proposed. previous studies had highlighted the potency of cross-presentation in vivo for the induction of primary CTL responses to vaccinia virus. previous studies had highlighted the potency of cross-presentation in vivo for the induction of primary CTL responses to vaccinia virus. mice were anesthetized and 25 L of the indicated rAAV vector diluted in 1 PBS was injected into the tibialis anterior or the ear dermis using a 30G RN Hamilton syringe. mOVA-HY-expressing constructs and recombinant AAV2/1-pseudotyped vectors were prepared as previously described. pSMD2-mOVA-HY-miR construct inserted in 3\u2032 UTR. control vectors used were AAV2/1-pseudotyped vector coding for the Cre recombinase. the 2 106 VPD-labeled cells were then injected into the retro-orbital venous sinus of previously immunized mice in a final volume of 200 L 1 PBS. drainage lymph nodes or injected tissues from three rAAV2/1-immunized mice were pooled for each experiment. r 30 min at 37\u00b0C in complete RPMI medium containing 2.5 mg/mL Collagenase D (Roche) and 10 g/mL DNase-I (Sigma-Aldrich) all cell suspensions were further stained with a combination of perCP-Cy5.5 anti-CD45.2 (104), phycoerythrin (PE)-Cy7 anti-CD11c (N418), PE anti-CD103 (2E7), antigen- FITC anti-CD44 (IM7), PE-Cy7 anti-CD62L (MEL-14) and anti-CD69 (H1-2F3), PerCP-Cy5.5 anti-CD127 (A7R34), and APC or biotinylated anti-TCR (H57-597). Dead cells were excluded using the LIVE/DEAD Fixable Near-IR Dead Cell Stain Kit (Life Technologies). spleen was homogenized and lysed in 0.9% NaCl. bacterial titers were assessed by plating dilutions on brain-heart infusion agar. lowest dilution used was a 1/16 dilution of the original solution. experiments cDNA generated from a pool of rAAV2/1-cOVA-injected tibialis anterior from Rag2/ mice. all statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software version 6. mOVA cDNA54 was fused to DBY608 and UTY246 epitopes encoding sequences encompassed by five N-terminal and 15 C-terminal amino acids. this construct was further inserted in a pSMD2 AAV2 plasmid between the promoter and a polyA signal to create the pSMD2-mOVA-HY construct. OT-1 cell suspensions were prepared by mechanically dispersing pooled spleen, inguinal, axillary, cervical, and mesenteric lymph nodes of donor Rag1/ OT-I mice in sterile 1 PBS containing 0.1% HSA. the 2 106 VPD-labeled cells were then injected into the retro-orbital venous sinus of previously immunized mice. skin-cell suspensions were prepared by separating the ventral and dorsal sheets of immunized ears and incubating them dermal side down in 1 PBS containing 4 U/mL Dispase II (Roche) for 45 min at 37\u00b0C. the epidermis layer was then separated from the dermis layer. the resulting cell suspensions were then filtered on a 40-m cell strainer. PE H2-Kb/OVA257 (SIINFEKL) tetramer (Clinisciences) staining was then performed in 1 PBS containing 0.1% HSA for 40 min at room temperature. cell suspensions were further blocked with anti-CD16/CD32 antibody (53-6.7), fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) anti-CD44 (IM7), PE-Cy7 anti-CD62L (MEL-14) and anti- all antibodies were purchased from BioLegend unless stated otherwise. spleen was homogenized and lysed in 0.9% NaCl. 3 days after the challenge, spleen was homogenized and lysed in 0.9% NaCl. -actin-R (5\u2032-TTTTCACGGTTGCTTAGG-3\u2032) primers were used in a final volume of 20 L. -actin-R (5\u2032-TTTTCACGGTTGCTTAGG-3\u2032) primers were used in a final volume of 20 L. conflict of interest The authors declare no conflict of interest."}
