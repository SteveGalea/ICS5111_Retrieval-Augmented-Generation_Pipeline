{"summary": "the virus is an enteric disease characterized by vomiting, watery diarrhea, and dehydration in swine. it was first reported in feeder and grower pigs in the UK in 1971. the virus has subsequently been reported in a number of european countries. PEDV can generally be controlled using the vaccine strategy. vaccination with killed or attenuated PEDV vaccine has been widely carried out in china. a severe acute diarrhea outbreak associated with high morbidity (80\u2013100%) and mortality (50\u201390%) was observed in suckling piglets at approximately 10 premises in Guangdong, China, in early 2011. some of these were still infected, showing transient diarrhea and anorexia, but not death. the CPE was characterized by cell fusion, syncytia formation and eventual detachment from the plastic surface. the virus isolate designated CHGD-01 was biologically cloned by three rounds of plaque purification in vero cells. phylogenetic analyses of the S protein amino acid sequences revealed that all PEDV strains in this study could be separated into two groups. the ORF3 gene of CHGD-01 shared 92.6\u201398.2% amino acid identity with other PEDV strains, and the highest identity with the Chinese strain BJ-2011-1. group 1 comprised CV777, Br1/87, SM98 and LZC strains. group 3 consisted of eight Korean field strains and 11 Chinese strains. phylogenetic analysis showed that CHGD-01 formed a fourth group, clearly different from other PEDV isolates. the CHGD-01 strain belonged to Group 2, which comprised seven Chinese strains (HB/GY, HB/LF, JS-2004-2, BJ-2011-1, CH/FJND-3/2011, CHGD-01), two Korean strains (KPEDV-9 and Chinju99), the recent Vietnamese strains (VN166M5 and VN122M6) and Thailand strains (NIAH1795, NIAH380 and NIAH2013). two amino acid changes (A145T, V216M) were found in Group 2; K252R, N255S and Q397L occurred only in Group 3; Groups 3, 4 shared two specific amino acid changes (S142T, H242L); and G84A was found in Groups 2, 3 and 4. Pathogen detection For PCR/RT-PCR detection of viruses, intestinal and fecal samples from 33 sick piglets were first examined. phylogenetic analyses of the S protein amino acid sequences revealed that all PEDV strains in this study could be separated into two groups. CHGD-01 belonged to group 2, which also contained the two Japanese isolates Kawahira and NK. the ORF3 gene of CHGD-01 shared 93.3\u201397.3% amino acid identity with other PEDV strains. phylogenetic analysis showed that CHGD-01 formed a fourth group, clearly different from other PEDV isolates. each group had unique differences in its sequences. an additional five unique mutations (L25S, I70V, C107F, F124L and D168N) occurred in CHGD-01. the highest amino acid identity (99.5%) was with the Vietnamese field isolates. the entire nucleocapsid protein of CHGD-01 was highly conserved. it was predicted to contain eight potential serine (S)-linked phosphorylation sites and six potential threonine (T)-linked phosphorylation sites. TGEV and other possible pathogens were excluded. PEDV was isolated successfully and propagated in vero cell cultures. however, the CPE caused by the PEDV isolate was not detected in Vero cells until after seven passages. these three Chinese strains formed a unique cluster with the highest amino acid identities to KNU-0802 (96.5%, 96.9% and 96.2%, respectively) in this study, the same amino acids insertions and deletion of the S gene were observed among three Chinese (CHGD-01, BJ-2011-1 and CH/FJND-3/2011) and two Korean (KNU-0802 and KNU-0902) strains. both were isolated in south Korea during 2008\u20132009. recombination analysis provided no evidence to suggest that CHGD-01 was derived directly from the recombination of known PEDV strains. variations within the CHGD-01 genome, especially in the ORF3 and S genes, place it in a new cluster with BJ-2011-1 and CH/FJND-3/2011, based on phylogenetic analysis. herds had been immunized with attenuated or killed PED-TGE combined vaccine. piglets aged 1\u201321 days were submitted for laboratory investigation. cytoplasmic vacuolation and exfoliation of enterocytes were noted. GM was removed from confluent monolayer cell cultures. the cells were then washed twice with DMEM and MM was added. the vero cell cultures were observed for 5 days for cytopathic effects. sequences were acquired using a kit for rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) all primers are listed in Table 1. phylogenetic trees based on amino acid sequences of the S, ORF3, M and N proteins were elaborated using the neighbor-joining method.

MM consisted of DMEM supplemented with 0.3% tryptose phosphate broth (TPB) and 10 g/ml trypsin (Gibco) intestinal samples positive for PEDV by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR were further filtered through a 0.22-m syringe filter. GM was removed from confluent monolayer cell cultures, which were then washed twice with DMEM. oligonucleotide primers were used to amplify the different regions of the CHGD-01 genomes. the PCR products were purified and cloned into pMD18-T vector (TaKaRa, Japan) the terminal sequences were acquired using a kit for rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) otides Locationa sequence 1 F 190-209 GCGTTCCGTCGCCTTCTACA 1R 2751-2729 CAGGAATCTGGAAGACACTTGCA 2 F 2663-2684 GTATTATGCCACCAGTGTCCCA 2R 4957-4938 CAGTTGCCACCAGGCACTGT 3 F 4887-4906 ACCAGCGGTGCATTGCTTGA 3R 7475-7453 CAATGTGCTCTTGCAATCCTGCA 4 PEDV strains investigated in this study Strain/Isolate Accession No, Country Strain/Isolate Accession No, Country (a) Complete genome VN122M6 HQ883484, Vietnam TGEV Purdue AJ271965. 8618, Japan CH/GSJ/07 HM210880, China Kawahira AB548622, Japan CH/JL/09 HM210881, China Chinju99 AY167585, Korea CH/GDS/09 HM210882, China KNU-0801 GU180142, Korea CH/HLJQ/2010 HQ455345, China KNU-0802 GU180143, Korea CH/HLJHG/2010 HQ455346, authors declare that they have no competing interest. authors\u2019 contributions YFP, XYT, WL carried out most of the experiments and drafted the manuscript. all of the authors read and approved the final manuscript."}
