{"summary": "dengue is endemic more than 125 countries around the world, especially south-east Asia, the Americas, the Western Pacific and Africa. in the past 50 years, the incidence has increased 30 fold and the affected area has extended to new countries and from urban to rural settings. rs4804803, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the promoter of DC-SIGN, is one of the widely studied loci in the research about the genetic susceptibility of dengue and severe dengue. the results are quite controversial, but the results are quite controversial. keywords of \u201cdengue\u201d and \u201cCD209 or DC-SIGN\u201d were also screened to identify relevant articles. all the studies included in this meta-analysis met the following criteria: (1) a human study with full paper available; (2) a case-control study on the association of rs4804803 polymorphism in DC-SIGN with the development of severe dengue in clinical dengue infection. pooled OR and its 95%CI were obtained by using the mantel\u2013Haenszel method in the fixed effect model or by using the Der Simonian and Laird method in the random effect model. p 0.05 was considered statistically significant unless there was specification. a human study with full paper available; a case-control study on the association of rs4804803 polymorphism in DC-SIGN with the development of severe dengue in clinical dengue infection. the original data about the genotype distribution is accessible; (4) published studies;(5) the distributions of genotypes did not differ significantly from the Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). pooled OR and its 95%CI were obtained by using the mantel\u2013Haenszel method in the fixed effect model or by using the Der Simonian and Laird method in the random effect model. p 0.05 was considered statistically significant unless there was specification. all the papers in this meta-analysis were published during 2005 to 2018, and patients were from Asia or South-central America (SCA). no significant associations were found under any other inheritance models (GG/GA). the results from subgroup meta-analysis uncovered the different role of rs4804803 in the development of severe dengue for different ethnicity. the carrying of G in rs4804803 acted as a risk factor when progression to severe dengue under dominant (GG/GA versus AA: OR = 1.86, 95%CI, 1.01\u20133.45), superdominant (GA versus GG/AA: OR = 1.81, 95%CI, 1.02\u20133.21) and a the study conducted by Noecker et al. was automatically excluded in all the genotype analysis due to absence of GG individuals in both groups. the study was conducted under dominant inheritance model (GG/GA versus AA) 0.044 Recessive GG versus GA/AA Matching criteria of controls 0.98 (4.41, 6.37) 0.58 0.603 Ethnicity 2.20 (3.00, 7.39) 1.35 0.271 Codominant GG versus AA Matching criteria of controls 0.86 (4.69, 6.40) 0.49 0.657 Ethnicity 2.31 (3.02, 7.65) 1.38 0.262 GA versus AA Matching criteria of controls 0.47 (0.60, sensitivity analysis showed pooled ORs and 95% CIs were inconsistent between fixed effect model and random effect model under any other inheritance models. sensitivity analysis showed that the significant pooled ORs were not robust under those three models. study Inclusion and Characteristics A total of 239 papers were identified through database searching. 122 of them were identified through database searching. all the papers in this meta-analysis were published during 2005 to 2018. patients were from Asia or South-central America (SCA) all the papers were published in 2005 to 2018, and patients were from Asia or South-central America (SCA). rs4804803 acted as a risk factor when progression to severe dengue under dominant (GG/GA versus AA: OR = 1.86, 95%CI, 1.01\u20133.45), superdominant (GA versus GG/AA: OR = 1.81, 95%CI, 1.02\u20133.21) and a codominant (GA versus AA: OR = 0.27, 95%CI, 0.10\u20130.70) inant meta-analysis by ethnicity on rs4804803 polymorphism and severity of dengue. five studies, which were Sakuntabhai(SI) and Sakuntabhai(KK) published in 2005, alagarasu published in 2013, oliveira(vietman) and oliveira(Cambodia) published in 2018, were automatically excluded in genotype analysis. criteria of controls were conducted. the result suggested ethnicity might be one of the reasons for heterogeneity under the dominant model (p = 0.044, Table 2).

Discussion DC-SIGN is preferentially expressed on myeloid DCs. the polymorphism of rs4804803 was related to the susceptibility of dengue, but it remains controversial. the genetic association studies showed that the polymorphism of rs4804803 might be related to the susceptibility of dengue. ADE was inversely correlated with surface expression of DC-SIGN in vitro. immature DC, which expresses lower level of DC-SIGN, did not undergo ADE. rs4804803 was recognized protectively to severe dengue in a studies from Brazil. the carrier of rs4804803 acted as a risk factor for the development of severe dengue in different ethnicities. it reduced the risk in SCA under recessive (GG versus GA/AA: OR 1) and a codominant (GA versus AA: OR > 1) models in Asians. the different role of rs4804803 in DC-SIGN during dengue infection might be related to the different frequency of G allele in rs4804803 between ethnicities. other factors, including genetic factors, might determine the different role of rs4804803 during dengue infection."}
