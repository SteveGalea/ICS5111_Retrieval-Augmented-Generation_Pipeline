{"summary": "the MERS-CoV genome was synthesized as a panel of six contiguous cDNAs (A\u2013F) that span the genome and are linked by class II restriction endonuclease sites (BglI-GCCNNNNNGGC) due to instability in the plasmid, the D fragment was split into two separate fragments, resulting in seven total cDNA cassettes. the full-length MERS-CoV genome was divided into seven contiguous cDNAs designated MERS A\u2013F. each subclone was digested with BglI, purified, and ligated. rMERS-CoV replicated to titers that approach 107 to 108 plaque-forming units/mL (pfu/mL) rMERS-CoV contains a BglI site at position 17717 that was ablated in rMERS-CoV. rMERS-CoV contains a BglI site inserted between the component E/F junctions. rMERS-CoV contains a BglI site inserted between the component E/F junctions. cultures of vero cells were infected with rMERS-CoV-RFP (A and C) or rMERS-CoV (B and D) at 12 h postinfection, the cultures were visualized for tomato red fluorescence (A and B) or by light microscopy (C and D) rMERS-CoV appeared to replicate 0.5 log more efficiently and formed larger plaques than rMERS-CoV. truncated ORF5 replaced ORF5 with the RFP gene (rMERS-CoV-RFP), or deleted downstream subgenomic ORFs 3, 4a, 4b, and 5. rMERS-CoV\u2022ORF5 and rMERS-CoV-RFP replicated to titers from 107 to 108 pfu/mL. the replication of rMERS-CoV-ORF3\u20135 was significantly reduced by cultures of cells were infected with MERS-CoV or recombinant derivative viruses. intracellular RNA was harvested and analyzed by Northern blot. increased S- but not N-protein expression levels were apparent in rMERS-CoV-ORF3\u20135\u2013infected cells (B) rMERS-CoV-3\u20135\u2013infected cells, a phenotype coincident with increased sgRNA2 expression. downstream TRSs are thought to influence the abundance of upstream transcripts, resulting in increased fusion phenotypes. rMERS-CoV-ORF3\u20135 was rarely evident in wild-type or recombinant control virus-infected cells. MERS-CoV replicated most efficiently in HAE and lung fibroblast cultures, slightly less efficiently in type II pneumocytes, and least efficiently in microvascular endothelial cells. compared in alveolar type II pneumocytes, lung microvascular endothelial cells, and rMERS-CoV-RFP. SARS-CoV did not replicate in any of the primary cell types examined in B. cells were specific to one of two donors, and neither was permissive for SARS-CoV. lane 1, primary alveolar type II pneumocytes; lane 2, primary lung fibroblasts; lane 3, primary undifferentiated airway epithelium; lane 4, primary lung microvascular endothelial cells. images are representative of two independent experiments. RT-PCR and Western blot analysis of DPP4 expression in primary human cells. the full-length MERS-CoV genome was ultimately divided into seven contiguous cDNAs designated MERS A\u2013F. each subclone was digested with BglI, purified, and ligated. each subclone was digested with BglI, purified, and ligated. rMERS-CoV, but not wild-type virus, should encode several unique marker mutations at the junctions associated with the assembly of the component clones. RT-PCR was used to generate cDNA amplicons, which were purified and then subjected to restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis with BglI. wild-type MERS-CoV, rMERS-CoV, and rMERS-CoV T1015N growth were compared in triplicate in vero 81 cells. rMERS-CoV-RFP expression and comparative plaque morphology. T1015N is a tissue culture-adapted mutation that arose during serial in vitro passage. the MERS-CoV genome encodes several accessory ORFs of unknown function. rMERS-CoV genome encodes several accessory ORFs of unknown function. rMERS-CoV-ORF3\u20135 removed several ORFs and TRSs from the genome, resulting in a loss of sgRNAs 3, 4 and 5 and increased expression and mobility of sgRNA2 (S glycoprotein) cultures of cells were infected with MERS-CoV or recombinant derivative viruses. rMERS-CoV-ORF5\u2013, rMERS-CoV\u2022ORF5\u2013, rMERS-CoV-RFP\u2013 and rMERS-CoV-ORF3\u20135\u2013infected cells. increased S-glycoprotein expression was noted in rMERS-CoV-3\u20135\u2013infected cells, a phenotype coincident with increased sgRNA2 expression. wild-type titers increased during infection in alveolar type II pneumocytes, microvascular endothelial cells, and fibroblasts. titers were approaching 106 to 107 pfu/mL within 30 h postinfection. MERS-CoV replicated most efficiently in HAE and lung fibroblast cultures, slightly less efficiently in type II pneumocytes. green bars, wild-type SARS-CoV; pink bars, wild-type MERS-CoV. rMERS-CoV-RFP growth kinetics were compared in alveolar type II (ATII) pneumocytes, lung microvascular endothelial (MVE) cells, and lung fibroblasts. rMERS-CoV-RFP was harvested and visualized by fluorescent microscopy. rMERS-CoV intracellular RNA was harvested and analyzed by Northern blot. RT-PCR and Western blot analysis of DPP4 expression in human cells. rMERS-CoV replicated less efficiently than wild-type MERS-CoV. phenotype was linked to a tissue culture-adapted mutation in the S2 glycoprotein of the passage 9 stock of wild-type virus. gRNAs encoding natural or indicator transgenes indicate that the core sequence AACGAA functions as a site for discontinuous transcription during negative-strand synthesis. deletion of ORFs 3\u20135 resulted in enhanced expression of sgRNA2 which encodes the S glycoprotein. this results are consistent with a model of discontinuous transcription during negative-strand synthesis. we have not been able to demonstrate MERS-CoV replication in standard laboratory strains of Mus mus musculus, M. domesticus, or M. m. castaneus mice. we have not been able to establish infections in immune-deficient mice, perhaps due to problems in receptor binding and entry (7). the data likely underscores the importance of correlating CoV infectivity patterns with DPP4 and TMPRSS2 expression in human tissues. highly pathogenic H5N1 strains replicate efficiently in microvascular endothelial cells, potentially providing a pathway for systemic spread to other organs. recombinant sARS-CoV strain Urbani was propagated on vero 81 cells (CCL-81; ATCC) in reduced-serum minimal essential medium (Opti-MEM) containing 4% (vol/vol) fetal clone II serum (HyClone/Gibco) and supplemented with kanamycin and gentamycin at 37 \u00b0C. samples were titered by plaque assay. primary human lung fibroblasts were obtained by outgrowth from finely minced distal human tissues onto scratched type 1/3 collagen-coated dishes. the cells exhibited typical fibroblast morphology and were negative for CD31 and pan-cytokeratin as assessed by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence staining. ided into two subclones designated MERS D1 and D2 containing mutations G494C and G17713T to disrupt two naturally occurring BglI sites. several silent mutations were included to produce unique BglI sites at appropriate locations across the genome. to restore ORF5, the MERS F plasmid was PCR-amplified with either primer set EMC F+1865 (5\u2032-tccaaccaacacactatgtc-3\u2032) or set EMC F+2820 (5\u2032-nnnnnnnnnnngctctcactttgtagatagaatccc-3\u2032) to make rMERS-CoV wild-type virus, the two PCR amplicons were digest the product was digested with BsmBI and then joined with T4 DNA ligase. the product was digested with NruI and SanDI and ligated into the MERS F plasmid using standard techniques. primers EMC 36F (5\u2032-ccgatattcacttcccccccctcctctctctctc-3\u2032) and EMC 37R (5\u2032-atcgagtttgat-3\u2032) were used to amplify an 880-bp\u2013long amplicon spanning a naturally occurring BglI site at nucleotide 17717. the blot was prehybridized and probed with a biotinylated oligodeoxynucleotide probe. filters were incubated with streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase, washed, and then incubated with the chemiluminescent substrate CDP-Star. blots were overlaid with film and developed. on particles that express the MERS-CoV S glycoprotein (VRP-S) or N protein (VRP-N) (each diluted 1:400) and developed using ECL chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Biosciences) a DPP4 antibody (LifeSpan BioSciences) or GAPDH mouse monoclonal antibody was used as a control. human lungs were obtained under protocol 03-1396. donors gave informed consent. human lung microvascular endothelial cells were obtained. raw DPP4 results were normalized to GAPDH and fit to a standard curve made using plasmids encoding DPP4. the clone was designed and purchased from Bio Basic as six contiguous cDNAs flanked by unique class II restriction endonuclease sites (BglI) gctgcacc-3\u2032 and reverse primer 5\u2032-tttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt to replace ORF5 with the RFP gene, one amplicon was generated by amplifying the F plasmid with primers EMC F+1376 and F2463Rev. the product was digested with PacI and SanDI and ligated into the MERS F plasmid using standard techniques. cells were allowed to recover for 10 min at room temperature and then incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 2\u20134 d in a 75-cm2 flask. cDNA was reverse-transcribed with a primer located in ORF5 and a forward primer located in the leader RNA sequence at the 5\u2032 end of the genome. primers EMC 36F (5\u2032-ccgatattctggttgat-3\u2032) and EMC 37R (5\u2032-atcg wild-type cDNA product cannot be cleaved with BglI in this region. recombinant virus PCR amplicon contains an engineered BglI site between nucleotides 24391 and 24401.
