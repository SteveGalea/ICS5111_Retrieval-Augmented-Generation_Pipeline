{"summary": "the current influenza A H1N1 2009 virus pandemic, 1 the ongoing zoonotic transmission of influenza A H5N1 and the emergence of oseltamivirresistant seasonal influenza A H1N1 are threats to human health. hospital health care workers (HCWs) are key to effective pandemic response and the capacity of health care systems. a prospective, cluster randomized trial of medical mask and respirator use in frontline HCWs was conducted from December 2008 to January 2009 in Beijing, China. we initially aimed to determine the efficacy of two different kinds of respiratory protection (N95 respirators and medical masks) during the influenza season compared to each other and compared to a nomask group. the nine hospitals in the convenience noarm group were not part of the randomization. hospitals were selected from the same type of wards as the intervention arms. they were followed up in the same way as the trial participants. 1, 2 and 3, influenza viruses A and B, respiratory syncytial virus A and B, rhinovirus A/B and coronavirus OC43/HKU1 by multiplex PCR. the choice of a relatively broad CRI definition was dictated by our interest in interrupting transmission of a wide range of respiratory viruses. 3MTM FT30 Bitrex Fit Test kit according to manufacturers\u2019 instructions (3MTM, St Paul, MN, USA) Detailed demographic and clinical details of all participants were collected. this included age, sex, smoking history, comorbidities, seasonal influenza vaccination status, medications, conduct of highrisk procedures. followup Participants were followed for 4 weeks of wearing the masks or respirators and an extra week of nonwearing for development of respiratory symptoms. two pharyngeal swabs were collected by a trained nurse or doctor. double rayontipped, plasticshafted swabs were used to scratch both tonsilar areas and the posterior pharyngeal wall. swabs were transported immediately after collection to the laboratory. oralen (8MOP) were added (8MOP, accompanied by UV irradiation for 20 minutes, prevents amplification of contaminated DNA. a mixture of 12 viral clones was used as a positive control template. sterile deionized water was used as a negative control. in the initial model, we included all the variables along with the main exposure variable those were significant (P 005) in the univariate analysis. we then used a backward elimination method to remove the variables that did not have any confounding effect. a prestudy assessment of hospital infection control levels determined that the hospitals had sufficient diversity to warrant stratified randomization by size of hospital and level of infection control. the assessment measured ventilation, spatial dimensions, bedding configuration, handwashing facilities and personal protective equipment use. intervention Participants wore the mask or respirator on every shift for 4 consecutive weeks. participants were shown when to wear it and how to fit it correctly. participants underwent fittesting procedure using a 3MTM FT30 Bitrex Fit Test kit. swabs of both tonsils and the posterior pharyngeal wall were collected. participants had two pharyngeal swabs collected by a trained nurse or doctor. multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out using the Seeplex\u00ae RV12 Detection kit (Seegen, Inc., Seoul, Korea) to detect adenoviruses, human metapneumovirus, coronavirus 229E/NL63, parainfluenza viruses 1, 2 or 3, influenza viruses A or B, respiratory syncytial virus A or B and rhinovirus A/B. a random effect logistic regression model was used to estimate odds ratio. the model was fitted using \u2018xtlogit\u2019 command in stata (College Station, TX, USA) a sample size of 488 participants or five clusters per arm was required for cluster size (m) 100 and intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) 001. as such, we aimed to recruit a sample size of 500 per arm. a total of 1441 nurses and doctors in 15 hospitals were recruited into the randomized arms. anyone smoking in family 187/492 216/488 005 213/461 001 380 (337\u2013423) 443 (399\u2013487) 462 (417\u2013508) Four or more people of family 89/492 122/488 001 113/461 002

Bold text signifies statistical significance. adherence with mask or respirator wearing was high and not significantly different in all arms. the duration of mask wearing in these arms was 52 hours (95% CI 51\u201354 hours), 49 hours (95% CI 48\u201351 hours) and 5 hours (95% CI 49\u201352 hours; Figure 3). 0% (62/775) 001 Wearing the mask/respirator Headaches 39% (11/281) 134% (94/701) 001 Skin rash 46% (13/281) 50% (35/701) 081 Difficulty breathing 125% (35/281) 194% (136/701) 001 Allergies 93% (26/281) 71% (50/701) 026 Pressure on nose 110% (31/281) 522% (366/701) 001 Other 07 we monitored all hospitals involved in the study for outbreaks. only hospital level and the N95 arm were significant against CRI and laboratoryconfirmed viral infection. a larger trial is needed to make a definitive judgment about the relative efficacy of respirators and medical masks. cluster RCTs can be impacted by heterogeneity of behaviours, meaning that we cannot exclude such effects caused by behaviours we did not measure. cluster design is also strength, as interventions against infectious diseases can have herd effects. adherence to mask/respirator use is also a potential problem. adherence to mask/respirator use is not the primary driver of adherence. adherence can change with perception of risk. author contributions: Raina MacIntyre receives funding from influenza vaccine manufacturers. she received consulting fees from SanofiPasteur MSD on modelling of varicella zoster virus. the remaining author declare that they have no competing interests. 3M china helped with fit testing for the study, but not financial support. thanks also go to the trial staff at the Beijing centre for disease control and surveillance.
