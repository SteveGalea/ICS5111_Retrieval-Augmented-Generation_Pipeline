{"summary": "genus Acinetobacter comprises strictly aerobic, Gram-negative, non-fermenting coccobacilli. most clinical isolates are reported to be strains of non-baumannii Acinetobacter spp.. in the last decade, carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter (CRA) has become worldwide public-health issue. acinetobacter is the primary blaNDM-1-positive genus rather than the Enterobacteriaceae. conventional PCR, real-time PCR, and loop-mediated isothermal amplification have been used extensively to rapidly identify most pathogens. the use of real-time PCR and LAMP is attractive, because they are highly sensitive and specific, time efficient, and generate less false-positive results. multiplex real-time PCR assay 1 and the class-D-oxacillinase-encoding genes (blaOXA-23-like, blaOXA-40-like, blaOXA-51-like, and blaOXA-58-like) in multiplex real-time PCR assay 2. these genes were: A. baumannii 16S\u201323S rRNA. ITS region between the 16S and 23S rRNA genes is a good candidate for bacterial species identification [23]. sequences of these genes were obtained from GenBank homepage (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/GenBank) amplicons of 16S\u201323S rRNA ITS, recA, blaNDM-1, blaOXA-23, blaOXA-40, blaOXA-51, and blaOXA-58 genes were cloned into the plasmid pMD18-T (TaKaRa Bio Inc., Dalian, China), then sequenced by TaKaRa. multiplex real-time PCR assays In multiplex real-time PCR 2, primers specific for the p16S\u201323S rRNA ITS-, precA-, and pNDM-1-positive strains were combined. the qPCR mixture contained 1 L of extracted DNA, 10 L of SYBR Premix Ex Taq qPCR (2), 0.0.4 L of ROX Reference Dye II (50), pairs of primers (optimized to final concentrations of 0.2 sensitivity and reproducibility were estimated with serial 10-fold dilutions of the recombinant plasmids p16S\u201323S rRNA ITS, precA, and pNDM-1 in multiplex real-time PCR 1 and pOXA-23, pOXA-40, pOXA-51, and pOXA-58 in multiplex real-time PCR 2. all the isolates were screened for the presence of blaNDM, blaOXA-23-like, blaOXA-40-like, blaOXA-51-like, and blaOXA-58-like genes. sputum and stool specimens were collected from inpatients between July 2014 and December 2014. informed consent was exempt as the Institutional Review Boards approved. phosphate-buffered saline (pH 6.8) was added to each specimen, mixed with vortexing. resulting sediment was resuspended in 1.8 mL of phosphate-buffered saline. DNA was extracted directly with the Mag-MK Bacterial Genomic DNA extraction kit. DNA extraction Fresh well-isolated colonies were used for total bacterial DNA extraction with a Mag-MK Bacterial Genomic DNA extraction kit (Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, China), according to the protocol of the manufacturer. after the final DNA extraction step, the DNA was dissolved in 40 L of Tris-EDTA buffer and stored at \u201320\u00b0C. all the primers were synthesized by Sangon Biotech Co. Ltd. Table 1. the primers were evaluated in a single SYBR-Green-I-based real-time PCR assay. plasmids of 16S\u201323S rRNA ITS, recA, blaNDM-1, blaOXA-23, blaOXA-40, blaOXA-51, and blaOXA-58 genes were cloned into the plasmid pMD18-T. multiplex real-time PCR assays In multiplex real-time PCR 1, primers specific for the p16S\u201323S rRNA the primers were optimized to 0.075 mM for OXA-23-like, 0.05 mM for recA, 0.05 mM for OXA-40-like, and 0.025 mM for OXA-58-like in multiplex real-time PCR 1. the optimal cycling conditions were 5 min at 95\u00b0C; 35 cycles of 20 s at 95\u00b0C, 45 s at 55\u00b0C, and 30 s at 72\u00b0C. two hundred and twenty-eight of the 400 isolates were identified as the A. calcoaceticus\u2013A. baumannii complex (ACB complex), since traditional identification methods are unable to differentiate Acinetobacter pittii,A. nosocomialis,A. baumannii and A. calcoaceticus. cells, A. baumannii 158062 (blaOXA-23- and blaOXA-51-carrying) cells, non-A. baumannii 140821016 (blaNDM-1-carrying) cells, and non-A. baumannii 151128 (blaOXA-58-carrying) cells (101\u2013108 CFU per mL) were prepared and 0.2 mL of each was added to the specimens. no matches to the primer sequences were found other than those to the corresponding genes. the primer pairs were initially validated using positive control strains carrying the target genes. multiplex real-time PCR assays were performed using real-time PCR and a melting-curve analysis. the assays were initially validated with recombinant plasmids carrying the target genes. the same Tm for each gene was detected when the positive control strains were tested. recA; C:NDM; D:OXA-23-like;E:OXA-40-like; F:OXA-40-like; G:OXA-58-like. intra- and interassay repeatability was tested in triplicate for each dilution within the same run. each concentration was repeated three different times to assess the reproducibility of the multiplex real-time PCR assays. .88 22.49 22.05 1.75 OXA-23-like 21.90 21.89 21.89 0.05 21.89 21.93 21.88 21.90 0.11 OXA-40-like 19.94 19.92 19.90 19.92 0.10 18.47 19.85 19.42 4.20 OXA-51-like 16.82 16.77 16.92 16.84 0.47 16.84 16.96 16.83 16.87 0.42 OXA-58-like 16.90 16.94 16.94 16.93 16.93 0.14 multiplex real-time PCR assays to directly detect target DNA from sputum and fecal specimens. sensitivity of multiplex real-time PCR assays was 102 CFU/mL. sensitivity of Acinetobacter baumannii (co-detection of ab16S-23S rRNA ITS and recA genes) in multiplex real-time PCR assay 1 from sputum specimens. sensitivity of carbapenemase genes (co-detection of blaOXA-23-like and blaOXA-51-like genes) in multiplex real-time PCR assay 2 from stool specimens. multiplex real-time PCR assays can detect almost all the alleles of each common carbapenemase gene (blaNDM, blaOXA-23-like, blaOXA-40-like, blaOXA-51-like, and blaOXA-58-like) of Acinetobacter spp., and can characterize and differentiate A. baumannii and non-baumannii Acinetobacter spp. sensitivity of multiplex real-time PCR assays for target DNA in human sputum and fecal specimens was 102 CFU/mL. no matches to primer sequences were found other than those to the corresponding genes. p16S\u201323S rRNA ITS, precA, pNDM-1, pOXA-23, pOXA-40, pOXA-51, and pOXA-58 were tested with multiplex real-time PCRassays. the linearity and limits of detection of the assays were determined with serial 10-fold dilutions of each recombinant plasmid. r2 = 0.992) over the entire copy number range. efficiencies of 0.962, 0.899, 0.909, 0.909, 1.025, 0.991, 1.232, and 1.139. the multiplex real-time PCR assays showed 100% concordance with conventional PCR. the carbapenemase genes of these strains were confirmed with PCR and sequencing. 16S-23S rRNA ITS 228 0 recA 228 0 recA 228 172 NDM 12 25 OXA-23-like 32 62 OXA-40-like 1 1 OXA-51-like 17 89 OXA-58-like 19 23 OXA-23-like and OXA-51-like 78 5 Fig 4. multiplex real-time PCR assays for directly detect target DNA from sputum and stool specimens. sensitivity of Acinetobacter baumannii (co-detection of ab16S-23S rRNA ITS and recA genes) in multiplex real-time PCR assay 1 from sputum specimens. sensitivity of carbapenemase genes (co-detection of blaOXA-23-like and blaOX multiplex real-time PCR assays developed in this study are less expensive than probe-based multiplex real-time PCR assays. they can detect almost all the allele of each common carbapenemase gene (blaNDM, blaOXA-23-like, blaOXA-40-like, blaOXA-51-like, and blaOXA-58-like) of Acinetobacter spp. clinical samples, such as blood, urine, stools, and sputum, contain inhibitors that interfere with PCR, causing amplification failure and increasing false-negative results. sensitivity of multiplex real-time PCR assays for the target DNA in the sputum and fecal specimens was 102 CFU/mL."}
