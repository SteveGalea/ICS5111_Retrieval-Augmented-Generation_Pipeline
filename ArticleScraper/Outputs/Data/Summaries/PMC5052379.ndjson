{"summary": "CIRD may be associated with single virus infections or with a multifactorial etiology. main viral agents involved in CIRD include canine distemper virus (CDV), Canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV), Canine adenovirus type 2 (CAdV-2) and Canid herpesvirus 1 (CaHV-1). the diagnosis of CIRD is largely based on the epidemiology, clinical signs and response to therapy. however, an etiologic diagnosis requires the identification of the agent or its products (proteins or nucleic acids) Vaccination is used to prevent or control respiratory infections in dogs. shelter #1 hosts stray dogs and cats of both genders, of all ages and primarily crossbred animals. shelter #1 was visited in the cold season when the temperatures ranged of 5\u201310 \u00b0C. shelter #3 hosts stray dogs and cats of both genders, varying ages and primarily crossbred animals. at the visit, 180 dogs and 20 cats were present in the shelter. the animals were allocated according to gender and age in collective fenced barns that had at least one dog house per animal. PCR reaction to CPIV was performed in a 25 L volume with 2 L of DNA (100\u2013200 ng) according to the PCR conditions described for each virus. primers to CPIV were obtained using the Clone Manager 7 program (http://www.scied.com), and the sequences are shown in Table 1.

CPIV was detected in single (30%) or in mixed infections and was associated with CAdV-2 (23%), CDV (4%), or both (14%). shelter #3 with individual dog houses and cages with a low population density and good sanitary conditions (approximately six dogs/cage) factors associated with animal overcrowding, such as excessive noise, poor air quality and diet, in addition to bad kennel cleaning, may cause stress. poor sanitary and nutritional conditions of shelter #1 may have favored the high rate of respiratory viruses. adenoviruses are highly resistant in environmental conditions and remain viable in the environment for an extended duration. a high prevalence of CAdV in dogs has been reported in shelters without a history of vaccination. a similar study in germany examined 68 nasal swabs of domestic dogs. a two-year longitudinal investigation in a shelter in the united states involving 211 necropsied dogs showed CaHV-1 involvement in 12.8% and 9.6% of trachea and lung samples. the identity of the sequenced matrix of the shelter samples with sequences deposited in GenBank revealed 96 to 99% identity (KU341102, KU341103, KU341104 and KU341105) with the N gene (AJ009656.1, JF965338.1, KC respiratory virus infections (CPIV, CDV, CAdV-2 and CaHV-1) are common in dogs housed in public shelters. the frequency and dissemination of these viral infections appear to be related to a high population density and poor sanitary and nutritional conditions."}
