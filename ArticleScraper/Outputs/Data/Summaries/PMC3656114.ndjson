{"summary": "infected human B cells in the circulation of the infected host are likely to constitute a major latent reservoir. the strong association of KSHV with primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) and the plasma cell variant of multicentric Castleman's disease strongly suggests a causative role of the virus in the pathogenesis of these B cell diseases. suggested lytic reactivation is blocked while establishment of latency is not impaired in cells lacking CBF1 [8], [9]. Alternatively, computational prediction of potential CBF1 binding sites in the viral genome was followed by biochemical and mutational analysis of the respective viral promoters. the bicistronic K14/ORF74 transcript encodes for ORF74 and K14. a wide spectrum of cell lines derived from diverse tissues can be infected with KSHV but human B cells and B cell lines appeared to be refractory to infection. ant virus and cultivation of these infected BJAB cells in stable latently infected cultures were generated. but viral reactivation was attenuated and virion production was almost blocked in these human B cells. to this end, we have infected isogenic CBF1 deficient and proficient B cell lines with recombinant KSHV. rKSHV.219 encodes for red fluorescent protein (RFP) under control of a CBF1 independent fragment of the KSHV early lytic PAN promoter. DG75 wt and DG75 CBF1 ko cells were infected with rKSHV.219 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of factor 5. 50 to 60 intracellular genomes were detected in BCBL-1 and BC-1 cells. both K-DG75 cell lines, CBF1 proficient and deficient, expressed the KSHV latent marker genes ORF73/LANA and K10.5/vIRF3 at similar levels. relative transcript levels of both viral genes were lower than in BCBL-1 and BC-1 cells but readily detectable. gene expression was normalized to -actin transcript levels. results were normalized to -actin transcript levels and are presented as mean values calculated from 2 independent experiments. the TPA/NaB treatment caused similar rates of dead cells in both populations. viable subpopulations were defined by forward and sideward scatter signals. sorted cells were compared for number of intracellular viral genomes. the results represent two independent experiments performed in duplicates. the HEK293 cells were harvested, concentrated and used to infect HEK293 cells. the cells were cultivated in the absence or presence of puromycin for 48 h. HEK293 cells infected with viral supernatants harvested from K-DG75 wt cells could be expanded in presence of puromycin. HEK293 cells infected with supernatants harvested from K-DG75 wt cells could be expanded in presence of puromycin. supernatants from K-DG75 wt cells lost their typical shape and their adherent phenotype and subsequently died. the viral gene expression profile was analyzed using a previously developed real-time RT-PCR array for KSHV. the genes were arranged into groups of latent, early and late lytic genes as reviewed. difference between CBF1 proficient and deficient K-DG75 cells was most pronounced 32 h post induction. latent genes, immediate early (n = 1), early (n = 40) and late (n = 35) genes and viral genes which have not yet been classified (n = 5) were retested by real-time RT-PCR. results confirmed that all lytic genes were induced in CBF1 proficient and deficient K-DG75 cells. the results are shown as the mean values of 2 experiments performed with 2 independent cell lines. K-DG75 wt and K-DG75 CBF1 ko cells were treated with 3 mM NaB for 48 h. relative transcript levels for ORF50/RTA, ORF57 and ORF59 were determined. K-DG75 CBF1 ko cells were stably transfected with an expression vector for Flag-tagged CBF1 (tet-CBF1) under the control of a bidirectional promoter. the expression of NGF-R was monitored by flow cytometry. cells were treated with 3 mM NaB. ORF50/RTA is the major transactivator of ORF57 and ORF59. ORF57 is a multifunctional protein which enhances splicing and translation efficiencies. 1107 k-DG75 wt or K-DG75 ko cells were transiently transfected with increasing amounts of an ORF50/RTA expression construct (15, 30 and 60 g), the corresponding control vector (ctrl) or left non-transfected. transcript levels for ORF50/RTA, ORF57 and ORF59 were determined by real-time RT-PCR. promoter activation of ORF59, ORF29a and ORF65 was significantly diminished. transactivation of the ORF9 and ORF62 promoters was not impaired. chromatin immunoprecipitations followed by real-time PCR for viral promoter fragments. SHV negative DG75 ko cells were cotransfected with 0.1 g of a ORF50/RTA expression vector, 5 g of a CBF1 expression vector or a control vector. the results represent means standard deviations derived from two independent experiments performed in triplicates. they are shown as x-fold induction compared to promoter activation by control vector and normalized to \u00df-galactosidase activity. rKSHV.219 encodes for red fluorescent protein (RFP) under control of a CBF1 independent fragment of the KSHV early lytic PAN promoter. the recombinant virus rKSHV.219 is a derivative of the KSHV strain obtained from JSC-1 cells. DG75 wt and K-DG75 CBF1 ko cell lines were cultivated in absence of puromycin a GFP negative population developed. only 30% of CBF1 proficient and 22% of CBF1 deficient B cells were still GFP positive after they had been cultivated in puromycin free media for 10 weeks. rKSHV.219 infected DG75 wt (K-DG75 wt) and DG75 CBF1 ko (K-DG75 CBF1 ko) cells were transferred to puromycin free medium and analyzed for GFP expression. results were normalized to -actin transcript levels and are presented as mean values calculated from 2 independent experiments. the combination of 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and NaB further enhanced RFP expression with a negligible difference between wt and CBF1 ko cells. the rate of dead cells was determined for treated and untreated cells by trypan blue exclusion assays. the results represent two independent experiments performed in duplicates. hek293 cells were harvested, concentrated and used to infect HEK293. lytic viral replication was impaired in CBF1 deficient B cells. supernatants were harvested, concentrated 100-fold and used to infect HEK293 cells. cellular viability was monitored by flow cytometry using forward and sideward scatter to visualize viable and dead cell populations. lytic viral gene expression profile was analyzed using a previously developed real-time RT-PCR array for KSHV that represents 86 viral genes. the difference between proficient and deficient K-DG75 cells was most pronounced 32 h post induction. induction of viral genes results in negative dCt values. negative values represent high expression levels and are marked in red. positive values represent low expression levels and are marked in green. results were normalized to cellular -actin expression and presented as x-fold increase post induction by 3 mM NaB for indicated time periods. a fraction of the chemically treated cells was separated into uninduced RFP/GFP+ and induced RFP+/GFP+ populations. flag-tagged version of the CBF1 protein was reintroduced into k-DG75 ko cells. expression construct carries bidirectional doxycycline responsive promoter [30] induction can be monitored by flow cytometry of a surrogate marker, a truncated version of the NGF-receptor. the transcript levels of ORF50/RTA, ORF57, ORF59, ORF29a, ORF29a and ORF4 were determined by real-time RT-PCR. results are shown as x-fold induction compared to values obtained from cells not treated with NaB. the lack of induction of ORF50 does not rescue ORF57 and ORF59 expression in CBF1 deficient K-DG75 ko cells. 1107 K-DG75 wt or K-DG75 CBF1 ko cells were transiently transfected with increasing amounts of an ORF50/RTA expression construct (15, 30 and 60 g), the corresponding control vector (ctrl) or left non-transfected. a fragment of 1000 bp upstream of the translational start site was tested as a putative promoter. all promoters responded to ORF50/RTA even in the absence of CBF1 in a dose dependent manner. promoter activation of ORF59, ORF29a and ORF65 was significantly diminished in CBF1 deficient DG75 cells. 5106 KSHV negative DG75 wt or CBF1 ko cells were cotransfected with increasing amounts (0.05, 0.1, 0.5 and 1 g) of ORF50/RTA expression or control vectors. the ORF29a-p promoter reporter constructs were cotransfected with 0.5 g of the ORF50/RTA. the data represent the mean value of 3 independent experiments. in mammals, CBF1 is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues. in mammals, CBF1 is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues. the functional analysis of CBF1 dependent processes has been hampered by the ubiquitous expression of CBF1 in human cells. the first report which described the interaction of RTA with CBF1 used CBF1 deficient fibroblasts to study the contribution of CBF1 to establishment of latency, reactivation and lytic infection. the latent marker genes ORF73/LANA and K10.5/vIRF3 were not relevant for the process of viral reactivation. however, it was not relevant for the process of viral reactivation. we have not analyzed the switch from GFP low to GFP high cultures in detail. phenotype of CBF1 deficient K-DG75 cells is truly caused by lack of CBF1. ectopic expression of ORF50/RTA in K-DG75 ko cells induced ORF57 and ORF59 expression weakly. but induction rates never reached levels obtained in K-DG75 wt cells. the promoter of ORF59 was studied in parallel since ORF59 is a well characterized target gene of RTA. the requirement for CBF1 is much more pronounced if endogenous ORF59 promoter activation is studied. the chromatin state of the ORF59 gene has an important impact on promoter responses to RTA. the DG75 human B cell line will be a versatile tool to study KSHV mutants in a cellular background that permits to inactivate genes by gene targeting. if antivirals targeting CBF1 signaling could be established we would expect that KSHV reactivation is severely impaired. k-DG75 CBF1 ko tet-CBF1 a (BS1177.3) and b (BS1177.7) or tet-ctrl a (BS1177.7) and b (BS1247.9) were cultured in media containing 20% FCS, puromycin (4 g/ml) and hygromycin B (400 g/ml) the PCR products were ligated into a luciferase reporter plasmid containing a
