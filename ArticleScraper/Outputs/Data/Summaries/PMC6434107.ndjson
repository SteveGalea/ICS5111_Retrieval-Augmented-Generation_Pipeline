{"summary": "influenza viruses are enveloped viruses harboring a negative-sense single-stranded RNA segmented genome. in such segmented nature of the viral genome resides the capacity of influenza viruses to form new reassortant strains following the concomitant infection of a host with more than one strain of human, and/or animal origin. reassortment events can result in an antigenic shift, defined as the generation of a new virus with antigenic properties drastically different from those of the influenza pandemics occurred during the 20th century and one so far in the twenty-first century. current flu vaccination presents several limitations that make it fall short of expectations in terms of effectiveness. insufficient vaccine coverage and suboptimal uptake in specific target groups also compromise vaccine effectiveness. antiviral drugs are key players in pandemic preparedness programs. they are the first choice for the treatment of infected patients and for preventive post-exposure prophylaxis of those potentially exposed to the new virus. the first class includes adamantane derivatives and rimantadine. NA inhibitors are competitive analogs of sialic acid, the preferred influenza receptor on the host cell's surface. by binding to the broadly conserved active site of the NA, NA inhibitors interfere with the sialidase enzymatic activity of the viral protein. oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir are licensed worldwide for the treatment of influenza A and B infections. the emergence of NA inhibitor-resistant virus variants is a matter of concern, with particularly higher frequencies among children and the immunocompromised (20). the emergence of NA inhibitor-resistant virus variants is a matter of concern, with particularly higher frequencies among children and the immunocompromised. baloxavir marboxil is a selective inhibitor of the cap-dependent endonuclease activity of the influenza viral PA polymerase subunit (27) baloxavir marboxil and oseltamivir moderately reduced the time to symptom alleviation compared to placebo and a regular 5-day treatment with oseltamivir (28) Currently approved anti-influenza drugs for the treatment of influenza viral infections. such limited therapeutic arsenal coupled with recurrent risk of emerging drug-resistance highlights the obvious unmet need of novel approaches. il Xofluza Selective inhibitor of the cap-dependent endonuclease activity of the influenza viral PA polymerase subunit Treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza in patients 12 years of age and older. the most fruitful basis for the discovery of a new drug is to start with an old drug, famously stated the 1998 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine Laureate, Sir James Black. despite the enormous scientific and technological advances that the field of biomedical research has witnessed in de novo drug development constitutes a time-consuming and expensive process. from initial discovery to market, it generally takes 13\u201315 years. repurposing arguably accounts for 30% of the new drug products approved by the FDA. the first one was introduced as an anti-nausea for pregnant women. it had to be rapidly removed from the market due to its teratogenicity. further research enabled this molecule as well as derivatives to be repurposed for the treatment of leprosy. polypharmacological phenomena include a single drug acting on multiple targets of a unique disease pathway, or a single drug acting on multiple targets pertaining to multiple disease pathways (50). polypharmacology is usually responsible for treatment toxicity or other undesirable adverse events, but some of these \u201cside-effects\u201d might also lead to drug repurposing. in silico-Assisted repurposing, computer-based approaches are gaining acceptance in the field of drug discovery. silico data mining and modeling tools have pushed our capacity to analyze data to the next level (58\u201360) in silico-Assisted Repurposing. ssisted drug repurposing resides on adopting an integrative strategy. this approach would put researchers in a better-informed position to design more comprehensive repurposing strategies with more effective predictive capacity. Thalidomide and sildenafil are two examples of such key observations. ant/function target recognized by the drug intended to be repurposed. the drug plays the same role as viral RNA polymerase inhibitor against both influenza and Ebola viruses. target-based repurposing can happen when a particular drug of known mechanism of action is found to have a new molecular/cellular target. sally kohn: target-based drug repurposing model relies on its dependence on the existing scientific knowledge of the drug/disease mechanism(s) of action/pathology and on potential alternative targets. kohn: despite this approach has been questioned due to the fact that the expected altered phenotype readout as a surrogate of an exploitable biological effect induced by the drug candidate might account for an important number of false positive \u201chits\u201d. kohn: in silico methods include the screening of chemical, biological, and text databases, analysis of quantitative structure-activity relationships, pharmacophores, homology models, and other molecular modeling approaches. the real power of computer-assisted drug repurposing resides on adopting an integrative strategy that combines the predictive and analytic capacity of in silico tools with some of the target biased or unbiased experimental evaluation/validation methods previously mentioned. favipiravir proved its repurposing potential for the treatment of Zika or Ebola viral infections (25, 43, 75) no anti-influenza agent issued from drug repurposing has yet reached regulatory market approval. however, advances made during the last years forecast optimism. ase inhibitor Serendipity Immunomodulator Phase II (NCT02056340) (78\u201380) Nitazoxanide anti-parasitic chronic hepatitis Inhibition of the pyruvate: ferredoxin/flavodoxin oxidoreductase cycle HA maturation & transport inhibition Phase III (NCT03336619) (81, 82) PPAR antagonists (i.e., Gemfibrozil clinical (93) Naproxen Approved NSAID Phase I anticancer COX-2 inhibitor NP-RNA binding inhibitor Phase II (94) Nalidixic acid Approved antibiotic Bacterial DNA replication inhibitor NA inhibitor Preclinical (95) Dorzolamide Approved anti-glaucoma drug Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor NA inhibitor Preclinical Ruxolitinib Approved for myelofibrosis treatment JAK inhibitor Virion formation & nitazoxanide is a thiazolide anti-infective initially licensed for the treatment of parasitic infections. it is acting at the post-translational level by selectively blocking the maturation of the viral glycoprotein HA. this drug presents potent antiviral activity against a large panel of circulating strains (82). e IkkB negatively impacts influenza vRNP transport and release of infectious viral particles. however, due to the pharmacokinetic limitations of ASA, the modified version with improved stability and tolerability was developed. LASAG modified version with improved stability and tolerability was developed. the last two examples of this chapter are midodrine and diltiazem, that we identified as influenza antivirals in the context of an in-silico assisted strategy. a new approach in drug repurposing is based on signature matching, which consists of comparing a specific characteristic of a drug\u2013its cellular signature\u2013to that of a disease (42). the potential antiviral properties of selected market-approved molecules were firstly validated in vitro. the most effective compounds were further compared to oseltamivir for the treatment of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infections in mice and in a physiological in vitro model of reconstituted human airway epithelia. a clinical trial was conducted during the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic in 2009-2010. a clinical trial failed to demonstrate whether oseltamivir/zanamivir combination therapy improved or reduced the effectiveness of oseltamivir alone in the treatment of influenza infections. treatment conferred a greater reduction of apical viral titers than that measured with the same-dose monotherapy. diltiazem-oseltamivir bitherapy compared with standard oseltamivir monotherapy for the treatment of severe influenza infections in intensive care units. drug repurposing offers a very large palette of possibilities to rapidly and efficiently find new antiviral drugs. conflict of interest Statement AP, BP, OT, and MR-C are co-inventors of two patent applications filed by INSERM, Universit\u00e9 Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Laval University and Hospices Civils de Lyon."}
