{"summary": "a number of crude extracts and purified natural compounds from plants have antioxidant and radical-scavenging activities. lowmolecular weight compounds such as vitamins, zeaxanthin, and flavonoids are considered the active ingredients in plants. Houttuynia cordata possesses pharmacological properties that reduce hypertension, edema, and inflammation. fermentation can improve the nutraceutical value of a product by breaking down certain undesirable compounds and inducing effective microbial conversion. bacterial strains were identified and isolated from traditionally fermented H. cordata extracts (FHCE), produced using the conventional fermentation process. all reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) unless otherwise stated. the cells were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium (DMEM) homology was confirmed with type of strain for phylogenic analysis. strain evolutionary process was estimated by Kimura two-parameter-model. phylogenic position was determined by neighbor-joining and maximum parsimony. the flow rate of the solvent was kept constant at 1.0 ml/min. cell viability was determined by a MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay provided by Sigma Aldrich. ed into a 96-well microplate at a density of 2 104 cells/well. cells were then washed twice with PBS and given fresh complete growth medium. the various doses SCE and SCFE were treated, and incubated for 24 hrs. 5 and 6 consisted of 1388 bp, 564 bp, 556 bp, 1441 bp, 556 bp, and 522 bp. the different strains were designated as SMh-1 to SMh-6. majority of Bacillus species are assigned the \u201cgenerally regarded as safe\u201d (GRAS status) the flavonoids present in the FHCE and HCE were rutin (2.1 mg/100 g, 1.1 mg/100 ml), quercitrin (16.6 mg/100 g, 11.8 mg/100 g), and quercetin (0.5 mg/100 g, 0.2 mg/100 g, 0.2 mg/100 g) the flavonoids present in the FHCE were rutin (2.1 mg/100 g, 1.1 mg/100 AW264.7 and RBL-2H3 were studied at different concentrations, i.e., 1000 g/ml, 100 g/ml, and 10 g/ml. cell viability was not affected by FHCE and HCE at any of these concentrations. therefore, FHCE and HCE are not cytotoxic. the percentages of inhibition induced by 1000 g/ml, 100 g/ml, and 10 g/ml FHCE and HCE on HepG2 cell viability were 38.31%, 47.40%, and 50.54%, respectively. the detection of rutin, quercetin, and quercitrin at approximately 20 M, 100 M, and 20 M correlated with the effects observed in the MTT assay. abcdef Means in the same row not sharing a common superscript are significantly different between groups at p 0.05. inhibitory effects of viability activity in HepG2 cell of flavonoid Group HepG 2 cell Rutin Quercetin 100 M 29.16 1.48bc 46.10 2.80e 21.64 3.38a 80 M 31.70 1.98cd 54.04 1.78f 26.83 2.20b 60 M 32.34 1.54cd 52 abcdefMeans in the same row not sharing a common superscript are significantly different between groups at p0.05."}
