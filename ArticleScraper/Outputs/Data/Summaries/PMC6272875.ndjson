{"summary": "double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) were discovered to play an important role in regulating gene functions by a sequence-specific post-transcriptional gene silencing mechanism called RNA interference (RNAi) the therapeutic potential of RNAi was soon realized. it presents a new and powerful approach to treat or prevent many diseases including respiratory disorders by modulating gene expression. dsRNA siRNA shRNA miRNA Structure ds, 500\u20131000 nt duplex ds, 21\u201323 nt in length with 2 nt 3\u2032 overhang 50\u201370 nt with a stem-loop structure. the siRNA is loaded into a protein complex called the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) the siRNA is then unwound, and the sense strand (also known as the passenger strand) of the siRNA is the mRNA is then cleaved by Argonaute 2 (Ago2) in the RISC, leading to the silencing of the target gene. synthetic siRNA is a more promising gene silencing mediator because of the lower risk of immune response. it is also the most widely investigated RNAi molecule for therapeutic applications. miRNA miRNA is a naturally occurring non-coding RNA that plays a key role in regulating gene expression. pri-miRNA is transcribed by RNA polymerase II from endogenous miRNA gene in the nucleus. the maturation pathway of miRNA is also similar to shRNA. synthetic miRNA (miRNA mimic) has the potential to target multiple genes due to the imperfect binding to the target mRNA [27]. compared to siRNA-based therapeutics, miRNA has the potential to target multiple genes due to the imperfect binding to the target mRNA. RNA shRNA is a sequence of RNA transcribed in the nucleus of the cells. the primary transcript is called primary shRNA (pri-shRNA), which contains a hairpin like stem-loop structure. the pri-shRNA is processed into a 50\u201370 nucleotides long loop-stem precursor shRNA (pre-shRNA) by a protein complex containing the dsRNA binding domain protein DGCR8. miRNA containing pri-miRNA is structurally similar to the pri-shRNA. pri-miRNA is converted into precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA) it contains 70\u2013100 nucleotides with interspersed mismatches and adopts a loop structure. the antisense strand of miRNA is only partially complementary to the target mRNA. pulmonary route of administration can deliver RNAi molecules directly to the site of action, thereby lowering the dose required while minimizing systemic adverse effects. inhalation is a non-invasive route of administration that is easily accepted by patients compared to parenteral administration. smaller particles under 100 nm may be successfully deposited in the alveolar space. inertia impaction occurs when large particles (>5 m) cannot adjust to change of airflow direction due to inertia. the role of pulmonary surfactant in nucleic acid delivery is controversial. commercial pulmonary surfactant was employed in the preparation of some polymeric nanoparticles to facilitate the cellular uptake of siRNA. RNA is extremely susceptible to nuclease activity. clathrin-dependent endocytosis is the most common route of cellular entry for macromolecules. RNAi molecules are entrapped in early endosomes where progressive acidification occurs. the late endosomes then fuse with the lysosomes, which contain hydrolases that degrade the RNAi molecules. inertia impaction occurs when large particles (>5 m) cannot adjust to the change of airflow direction due to inertia and deposit on the airway walls. the presence of fluid layers in the airways, including the mucus and the pulmonary surfactant, also creates a barrier to the delivery of drug molecules to the lungs. sylated residues rich in serine and threonine and the hydrophobic non-glycosylated cysteine-rich domains allow electrostatic, hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions between mucus and drug particles. mucus is continuously produced, shed and replaced, and together with the mucociliary clearance action, the fast turnover rate of mucus leads to the rapid clearance of the entrapped drug molecules. RNAi molecules are subjected to degradation inside the macrophages before reaching their target sites. the ultimate site of actions depends on the types of RNAi molecules. for synthetic siRNA and miRNA mimic, they need to reach the cytoplasm where the RISC locates. adenoviruses, adeno-associated virus (AAV) and retroviruses express the plasmid DNA encoding shRNA or miRNA to induce RNAi. the most attractive property of viral vectors is that they have the ability to access the nucleus of the cells. poor safety profile, high production cost and the risk of immunogenicity. the lipid-based vectors are the most commonly used vectors for RNAi delivery. they include cationic liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, solid nanostructured lipid carriers, lipidoids and pH-responsive lipids. the major challenges of using the lipids are the immune response and cytotoxicity. ase activity in the lungs makes successful delivery of unmodified RNA possible. but the mechanism of how naked siRNA could overcome the extracellular and intracellular barrier following pulmonary administration remains to be understood. viral vectors refer to the of use of viruses to deliver genetic materials to the cells. the major challenges of using the lipids are the immune response and cytotoxicity. biocompatible and biodegradable natural polymers such as chitosan and dextran are used for the preparation of polymeric nanoparticles for RNA delivery. peptides such as poly(l-lysine) (PLL), cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) and pH-responsive peptides are under development. Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death in the world. the mainstay of treatment is chemotherapy, which is indicated for around 70% of newly diagnosed patients with local and advanced metastatic disease. other treatment options include surgery and radiotherapy. 30 g siRNA (1.5 mg dry powder formulation) was administered to mouse with lung tumors stably expressing EGFP expression in lung tumors consisting of EGFP cells was effectively silenced [9] 2015 RPN2 PnkRNA Intratracheal/Naked PnkRNA 15 g of PnkRNA was administered to lung cancer xenograft mouse model as single dose or once a week for 3 weeks Lung tumor growth was significantly inhibited without serious toxicity Akt1 is an important mediator of cell growth, proliferation and survival of non-small cell lung cancer. Akt1 is an important mediator of cell growth, proliferation and survival of non-small cell lung cancer. c-myc oncogene is a downstream conduit for most oncogenic signals. it is necessary for growth control, differentiation and apoptosis. c-myc oncogene is associated with many tumors. e is a cell adhesion peptide responsible to mediate cell adhesion and proliferation by binding to the integrin avb3 receptor family. this strategy successfully suppressed c-myc expression level and tumor cell proliferation, resulting in approximately 80% increase in survival of orthograft mouse tumor models. combination therapy offers potential advantages of synergistic activity. lipid-based nanoparticles containing siRNA targeting Bcl-2 and MRP1. anticancer drugs (doxorubicin or paclitaxel) were delivered to lung of tumor mice. RNAi Administration/Delivery System Methods Key Observations Ref. Year RSV P protein siRNA Intranasal/Naked siRNA or TransIT-TKO 5 nmol (70 g) of siRNA was administered to mouse at time of RSV and/or PIV infection. significant reduction of viral load was achieved in both prophylactic and therapeutic regimens. RNAi was first reported to inhibit respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in 2001 [131], an increasing number of studies have been initiated to explore the potential of RNAi technology. RNAi molecules can target the conserved region of mRNA sequence in the viral genome, making it effective against mutated viral strains. to achieve effective antiviral effect, the viral targets must be essential for the pathogenesis of viral infection and/or replication cycle. the target genes share similar conserved sequence among different strains to achieve broad viral inhibition. the administration of siRNA before and concomitant with RSV infection was more effective in reducing viral load than treatment after infection. it is desirable to initiate the antiviral RNAi therapy as quickly as possible once RSV infection is confirmed. the group treated with ALN-RSV01 had a significantly lower number of RSV infection compared to the placebo group. the primary endpoint of the study was to evaluate the effect of ALN-RSV01 on the incidence of new or progressive bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) siRNA targeting NP was dose-dependent and combination of siRNAs targeting NP and PA enhanced the effect. DNA was mixed with infasurf, a commercial available pulmonary surfactant. a significant reduction of virus titer was detected 24 h after infection. RNAi-based therapeutics against TB aims to modulate the gene expression of the host instead of the bacillus because bacteria do not contain the necessary machinery for RNAi. RNAi is a host defense mechanism against mycobacterium tuberculosis. the formation of granuloma is a compact, organized aggregate of immune cells. it provides a hospitable environment for mycobacteria to survive and replicate. there is a complicated chemokines and cytokines network involved in the granuloma formation. cytokines restrain inflammation through affecting helper T cell 1 (Th1) response and macrophage activation, leading to substantial reduction of their antimicrobial activity. siRNA immunotherapy is a feasible approach to enhance the host antimicrobial capacity. RNAi administration/delivery system Methods Key Observations Ref. year Asthma SOCS siRNA Intranasal/Naked siRNA 2 M siRNA (0.4 g) was administered to OVA sensitized and challenged mouse (total 10 doses, every 3 days) Decrease in lung eosinophilia, significant reduction of AHR, mucus secretion and collagen deposition in the airways [12] 2014 IL-4 siRNA and P protein mpl knockdown reduced lung inflammation, Th2 cytokine secretion and mucus secretion [167] 2013 Rip2 siRNA Intratracheal/Naked siRNA 1 or 5 nmol of siRNA (13 g or 67 g) was administered to OVA sensitized and challenged mouse for 3 consecutive days OVA-induced cytokine release, inflammatory cell infiltration and mucus hypersecretion were inhibited. suppression of airway inflammation and Tf-PEI 750 pmol of siRNA (10 g) was administered to mouse model of ALI induced by LPS Expression of IL-6 and TNF- in BALF and lung tissues. the inflammatory response was significantly reduced [11]. asthma Asthma is characterized by the variable and reversible airflow obstruction, airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), mucus hypersecretion and chronic inflammation. the most common form of asthma is allergic asthma, which is triggered by environmental stimuli such as house dust and seasonal pollen [177]. type cytokines, interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-5 and IL-13, are the main players in the pathology of allergic airway inflammation. they contribute to allergic sensitization, IgE production, eosinophil infiltration and AHR respectively. RNAi technology can be employed to target these cytokines. the therapeutic potential of targeting IL-4 and P protein of RSV simultaneously by siRNAs was examined in a mouse model of asthma exacerbation. the intranasal delivery of the two siRNAs significantly suppressed IL-4 mRNA expression and RSV replication in the lungs. NF-B plays a key role in the expression of many pro-inflammatory proteins. RNAi significantly inhibited the expression of downstream Th2 cytokines. the key receptor tyrosine kinases involved in the inflammatory response in asthma include epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), c-kit (a stem cell factor receptor) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) the non-receptor forms are spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), Src and janus kin RNAi targets dendritic cells (DCs) in the airways. they are active in the differentiation of Th2 cells. they also contribute to the progress of airway inflammation. it is desirable to develop a novel therapy that can simultaneously control the symptoms and improve the long-term prognosis of the disease. despite similar clinical features, the mechanisms of underlying airway inflammation in asthma and COPD are different with distinct patterns of inflammatory cells and mediators involved. modulation of expression of multiple genes using miRNA could be a direction of RNAi therapy for the treatment of COPD. ALI is a severe form of diffuse lung disease that is commonly caused by acute systemic inflammatory disorders. it can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or more critically, multiple organ failure and even death. suppressing endothelial S1PLyase expression by siRNA is a therapeutic approach to maintain the integrity of the endothelial barrier [217] HMGB1A peptide is an antagonist of the pro-inflammatory cytokine HMGB1 and provides additional anti-inflammatory effect in ALI. effective targeting to T cells in vitro was achieved by electroporation [219], an approach that is not clinically feasible. a ligand-polymer conjugate siRNA delivery system, transferrin-polyethylenimine, has been developed to target T cells in the lungs. however, the therapeutic effect of the system was not evaluated. pulmonary fibrosis is a lung disease with huge unmet medical need. RNAi has been exploited to suppress production of key molecules involved in the fibrotic process, such as TGF- [92,224], amphiregulin (AR) and connective transforming growth factor. fibrotic genes significantly reduced expression level and further alleviated the fibrotic feature in the bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis [92] results suggest potential of targeting TGF- or its signaling pathway using RNAi technology for the management of lung fibrosis. a complication of using TGF- as the molecular target of RNAi is related to its physiological role in maintaining immune and cellular homeostasis. targeting the downstream effectors of TGF- may offer the therapeutic benefit of inhibiting the TGF--mediated fibrotic response while preserving the major physiological function of the profibrotic cytokine. the survival rate of the animals treated with siRNA targeting CTGF was significantly increased in comparison with the group treated with scrambled siRNA. a modified self-assembled micelle interfering RNA nanoparticles (SAMiRNA) was developed. the nanoparticles contain hydrophilic polymer and hydrophobic lipid on each ends of siRNA. RNAi Administration/Delivery System Methods Key Observations Ref. year Akt1 shRNA Inhalation/SDA-PEI 400 g of dual expression vector (shRNA and Pdcd4 cDNA) was administered to mouse with lung cancer twice a week for 4 weeks Inhibition of Akt1 and overexpression of Pdcd4 synergistically suppressed lung tumorigenesis [101] 2015 Bcl-2 siRNA Intratracheal/PE a week for four weeks Lung cancer growth, cancer cell proliferation and angiogenesis was suppressed, apoptosis was facilitated. a week for four weeks Lung tumorigenesis was suppressed, apoptosis was facilitated. Akt1 is an important mediator of cell growth, proliferation and survival of non-small cell lung cancer. Akt1 is an important mediator of cell growth, proliferation and survival of non-small cell lung cancer. based shRNA can achieve potent knockdown of the target. there are safety concerns regarding the use of viral vectors for inhalation. c-myc oncogene is a downstream conduit for most oncogenic signals. antitumor effect was triggered by PnkRNA targeting RPN2 without the use of other anticancer drugs. the mechanism of how the naked the PnkRNA molecules overcame extracellular and intracellular barriers to initiate RNAi was not elucidated. synergistic antitumor efficacy was achieved compared with siRNA alone. suppression of resistance gene by RNAi molecules via inhalation could restore sensitivity of chemotherapeutic drugs. Akt1 is an important mediator of cell growth, proliferation and survival of non-small cell lung cancer. safety concerns include potential mutagenicity, immunogenicity and risk of aerosol-transmitted infections. aerosol delivery of RNAi molecules using viral vectors must go through vigorous biosafety evaluation for clinical use. antitumor effect was triggered by PnkRNA targeting RPN2 without the use of other anticancer drugs. mechanism of how the naked the PnkRNA molecules overcame extracellular and intracellular barriers to initiate RNAi was not elucidated. combination therapy offers potential advantages of synergistic activity, overcoming the drug resistance and reducing the side effects of chemotherapy. antitumor efficacy was achieved compared with the delivery of doxorubicin or siRNA alone. suppression of resistance gene by RNAi molecules via inhalation could restore the sensitivity of chemotherapeutic drugs. shRNA expressing both NP and PB1 was administered by hydrodynamic injection to mouse 16\u201324 h before infection. second dose was administered at same time of infection by intranasal instillation. treated animals were protected from lethal challenge with highly pathogenic viruses. RNAi molecules can target the conserved region of mRNA sequence in the viral genome, making it effective against mutated viral strains. RNAi molecules can be designed rapidly to target viral genes, shortening the lead time of developing new antiviral agents. to date, there is no licensed vaccine available to prevent this disease. there is an unmet need to develop effective RSV therapeutics and vaccines in the pediatric and adult population. intranasal administration of ALN-RSV01 was well tolerated and the side effect profile was similar to placebo. in 2010, the antiviral effect of ALN-RSV01 was evaluated in a phase II trial. another phase II b clinical trial of ALN-RSV01 in RSV-infected lung transplant patients was completed. the most commonly investigated targets are nucleocapsid protein (NP), polymerase acidic protein (PA) and polymerase basic protein (PB). these proteins are highly conserved across different subtypes of influenza virus strains. the combined siRNA delivery method effectively protected animals against lethal challenge of highly pathogenic avian influenza A viruses. however, the exploration of RNAi for the treatment of influenza appears to reach the bottleneck. it could be partly attributed to the criticism of the antiviral effect induced by siRNA, which was due to innate immune response rather than viral inhibition through RNAi. a number of host factors involved in the regulation of autophagy were explored as the target of RNAi, including Bfl-1/A1 [152], Rap22a [153], Ras homologue enriched in brain (Rheb) [154] and UV radiation resistance-associated gene (UVRAG) [155]. RNAi can be used to target immunosuppressive cytokines in order to inhibit the growth of Mtb. XCL1 regulates IFN- production by CD4+ T cells. suppression of XCL1 expression in the lungs was associated with decreasing number of T lymphocytes, reduction in the IFN- response, disorganized granulomatous lesions and higher fibrosis. combining immunotherapy targeting immunosuppressive cytokines and chemotherapy to target drug resistance bacteria population is a direction that is worth future investigation. severe RSV infection has been observed in elderly patients with lung diseases or immunocompromised patients. the administration of siRNA before and concomitant with RSV infection was more effective in reducing viral load than treatment after infection. it is desirable to initiate the antiviral RNAi therapy as quickly as possible once RSV infection is confirmed in clinical practice. primary endpoint of the study was to evaluate the effect of ALN-RSV01 on the incidence of new or progressive bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) infected lung transplant patients. inhaled treatment induced a clinically meaningful reduction in the incidence of BOS, reinforcing the potential of inhaled RNAi as new antiviral therapeutics. a significant reduction of virus titer was detected 24 h after infection. it could be possible that the DNA interacted with the charged lipid components in the pulmonary surfactant leading to the efficient spread and absorption in the airways. RNAi-based therapeutics against TB aims to modulate the gene expression of the host instead of the bacillus because bacteria do not contain the requisite machinery for RNAi. RNAi has been investigated for TB treatment in two directions. a number of host factors involved in the regulation of autophagy were explored as the target of RNAi. RNAi can be used to target immunosuppressive cytokines in order to inhibit the growth of Mtb. tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- and IFN- are critical in activating macrophages. XCL1 is a chemokine produced by activated CD8+ T cells. siRNA targeting TGF-1 was administered through intrapulmonary route to IL-10 knockout mice at 60 days post-infection. increased expression of antimicrobial mediators nitric oxide (NO) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) reduced the bacterial load for at least four weeks. asthma SOCS siRNA Intranasal/Naked siRNA 2 M siRNA (0.4 g) was administered to OVA sensitized and challenged mouse (total 10 doses, every 3 days) Decrease in lung eosinophilia, significant reduction of lung eosinophilia, significant reduction of AHR, mucus secretion and collagen deposition in the airways. cytokine release, inflammatory cell infiltration and mucus hypersecretion were inhibited [168] 2013 Let-7 miRNA mimic Intranasal/Naked miRNA 50\u2013300 nM microRNA was administered to OVA sensitized and challenged mouse for 3 consecutive days Expression of IL-13 was inhibited in the lungs. suppression of airway inflammation and AHR were significantly inhibited [170] 2008 CD86 siRNA Intratrachael/Naked siRNA siRNA intratracheal/siRNA/HMGB1A/R3V6 ternary complex 300 pmol of siRNA (4 g) was administered to ALI mouse model induced by LPS Expression of IL-6 and TNF- in BALF and lung tissues. the inflammatory response was significantly reduced [11]. the most common form of asthma is allergic asthma, which is triggered by environmental stimuli such as house dust and seasonal pollen. the mainstay treatments of asthma are corticosteroids, 2-adrenergic receptor agonists and leukotriene receptor antagonists, either alone or in combination. silencing of SOCS3 down-regulated expression of cytokines, IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13, leading to substantial reduction of airway inflammation, AHR and IgE production. inflammatory and antiviral siRNAs is a prospective therapy for patients with virus-induced exacerbation of severe uncontrolled asthma. many transcription factors including nuclear factor-B (NF-B) [168], signal transducer and activator of transcription factor 6 (STAT6) [166] and GATA-binding protein 3 (GATA3) [170] are involved in the production Th2 cytokine in the airways of patients with asthma. the key receptor tyrosine kinases involved in the inflammatory response in asthma include epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), c-kit (a stem cell factor receptor) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) the non-receptor forms are spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), Src and janus kinase (JAK) [196] DCs are antigen presenting cells that could be found in the airways. they are actively involved in the differentiation of Th2 cells. the binding of CD80/CD86 with CD28 and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 molecules on T cells is necessary for priming naive T cells into Th2 cells. despite similar clinical features, the mechanisms of underlying airway inflammation in asthma and COPD are different with distinct patterns of inflammatory cells and mediators being involved. the major signaling factors involved in the pathogenesis of COPD include TNF-, CCL2, CXCL8, TGF- and VEGF [206]. systemic delivery of siRNA targeting TNF- significantly reduced expression of TNF- in the lungs and lung injury in a shock-induced ALI mouse model [175] pulmonary epithelial cells contribute to the release of TNF- leading to lung injury following a systemic inflammatory insult. suppressing endothelial S1PLyase expression by siRNA is a therapeutic approach to maintain the integrity of the endothelial barrier. nanoparticles containing siRNA targeting S1PLyase and recombinant high mobility group box-1 A peptide were delivered to the lungs of LPS-induced ALI mouse model by intratracheal instillation. transferrin-polyethylenimine (Tf-PEI) has been developed to target T cells in the lungs [174]. the rational of such a design was based on the increased expression of transferrin receptors on T cells after activation. however, the therapeutic effect of the system was not evaluated. the most common form of asthma is allergic asthma, which is triggered by environmental stimuli such as house dust and seasonal pollen [177]. the mainstay treatments of asthma are corticosteroids, 2-adrenergic receptor agonists and leukotriene receptor antagonists, either alone or in combination. there are challenges of poor patient compliance, intolerability and long term adverse effects. targeting suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) 3 is an alternative approach. SOCS proteins are negative regulators of cytokine signaling pathway. the expression of SOCS3 is a pathological marker of allergic disease. many transcription factors including nuclear factor-B (NF-B) [168], signal transducer and activator of transcription factor 6 (STAT6) [166] and GATA-binding protein 3 (GATA3) [170] are involved in the production Th2 cytokine in the airways of patients with asthma. they were investigated as targets for RNAi in the management of asthmatic inflammation. inflammatory response in asthma include epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), c-kit (a stem cell factor receptor) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), while non-receptor forms are spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), Src and janus kinase (JAK). intranasal administration of siRNA targeting c-kit also induced a promising result in reducing mu the binding of CD80/CD86 with CD28 and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 molecules on T cells is necessary for priming naive T cells into Th2 cells [203]. blocking CD80 and/or CD86 activity with pharmacological inhibitors can inhibit T cell activation and alleviate AHR and pulmonary inflammation in mice exposed to aerosolized allergen challenge. many of the cytokines and chemokines secreted in the airways of COPD patients are modulated by the NF-B pathway. RNAi targeting NF-B pathway can be a strategy for the management of COPD [176,209] pathological changes include the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. the latter can facilitate the extravasation of protein-rich fluid and the infiltration of neutrophils. there is no pathophysiologic-driven therapeutic approach available [162] nanoparticles containing siRNA targeting HMGB1A peptide were delivered to the lungs of ALI mouse model by intratracheal instillation. HMGB1A peptide is an antagonist of the pro-inflammatory cytokine HMGB1 and provides additional anti-inflammatory effect in ALI. an arginine-rich R3V6 peptide was used as a carrier. biodistribution study showed that Tf-PEI polyplexes can selectively deliver the fluorescently labeled siRNA to activated T cells in a murine asthma model. however, the therapeutic effect of the system was not evaluated. targeting delivery of RNAi therapeutics to specific cell types associated with the disease is a field that certainly required further exploration. RNAi has been exploited to suppress the production of key molecules involved in the fibrotic process, such as TGF- [92,224], amphiregulin (AR) and connective transforming growth factor (CTGF). clinical trials examining the effect of neutralized antibodies to block the activity of TGF- are currently ongoing. year TGF-1, CTGF, PDGF, CCL2 and Tissue factor siRNA intratracheal/Naked siRNA 0.05\u20135 mg/kg of siRNA (1\u2013100 g) was administered to mouse models of pulmonary fibrosis (total 3 doses) both treatments inhibited the expression of TGF-1 and attenuated the fibrotic response. a complication of using TGF- as the molecular target of RNAi is related to its physiological role in maintaining immune and cellular homeostasis. targeting the downstream effectors of TGF- may offer therapeutic benefit of inhibiting the TGF--mediated fibrotic response while preserving the major physiological function of the profibrotic cytokine. nanoparticles contain hydrophilic polymer and hydrophobic lipid on each ends of siRNA and can spontaneously form micelle in solution. the expression of AR and CTGF, and collagen accumulation in the lung of pulmonary fibrosis model were significantly reduced compared to control SAMiRNA. dry powder aerosol is preferred over liquid aerosol due to higher stability. dry powder inhalers are easier to operate with better lung deposition. there are also a growing number of clinical pipelines involving the use of siRNA. RNAi is more effective in prophylactic regimen than in therapeutic regimen. long-term therapy is expected for inflammatory diseases. pulmonary delivery of RNAi molecules targeting airway diseases is promising."}
