{"summary": "AD symptoms are triggered by various non-specific or specific allergic reactions. the barrier disrupted skin in AD is easily permitted the percutaneous entry of environmental allergens that strongly promote Th2 immunological responses. the genome of hPIV2 encodes 7 mRNAs [12]\u2013[14] and has about 60-nt leader sequence at 3\u2032 end. the gene order is 3\u2032 (leader)-NP-V/P-M-F-HN-L-(trailer)-5\u2032. vRNA is encapsidated with the NP proteins to form the ribonucleoprotein complex. hPIV-based vectors have proven the effect in inducing local and systemic immunity against a number of foreign antigens. they replicate exclusively in the cytoplasm of infected cells, don\u2019t have a DNA phase during their life cycle. rhPIV2 lacks M gene that is an essential gene for virus particle formation by insertion of two stop codons. plasmid pPIV2 is a full-length cDNA copy of hPIV2 anti-genome. the virus was cloned in a mammalian gene expression vector (pCAGGS) the cells were harvested, then co-cultured with fresh Vero cells every 48 hr. hPIV2/EGFP and hPIV2/Ag85B titers were expressed as 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) mice were inoculated intranasally with 20 l (5106 TCID50) of rhPIV2/Ag85B or rhPIV2 on day 4. rhPIV2 Vector Expressing EGFP haCat cells were seeded one day before the transduction at 1106 cells/ml (1 ml/well) the cells were seeded one day before the transduction at 1106 cells/ml (1 ml/well) the next day, the media was removed and 1 ml of the rhPIV2/EGFP viruses were added to the cells to be adjusted to 1106 TCID50. repeated application of OX causes delayed type hypersensitivity followed by immediate-type and late phase reaction. mice were infected intranasally with 5106 TCID50 of the virus in a 20 l inoculum or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) on day 4. cDNA was synthesized from 2 g of mRNA using an archive kit. quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to measure transcriptional activity in skin lesions. a 25 l reaction mixture containing 1 g of cDNA, 900 nM of each primer, and 250 nM of TaqMan probe was mixed with 12.5 l of TaqMan Master Mix (AB) rhPIV2/Ag85B and rhPIV2/EGFP rhPIV2/Ag85B and rhPIV2/EGFP were constructed according to the method reported previously, except for methods of the supply of T7 and hPIV2 RNA polymerases (NP, P, L) rhPIV2/Ag85B and rhPIV2/EGFP were constructed according to the method reported previously. rhPIV2/EGFP were recovered by co-transfection of each anti-genomic plasmid and plasmids expressing the NP, P, M and L. the cells were harvested, and then co-cultured with fresh Vero cells every 48 hr. 90% of the cells showed syncytia formation in the 10th co-cultured cells. mice were inoculated intranasally with 20 l (5106 TCID50) of rhPIV2/Ag85B or rhPIV2. rhPIV2 vector or phosphate buffered saline were also applied as controls. two hours after infection, the media was removed and fresh culture media was supplemented to the cells. the respiratory tract and lung were sampled, embedded in Tissue-Tek OCT compound (Miles, Elkhart, USA), frozen in liquid nitrogen. sections were examined and recorded by fluorescence microscopy. samples were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. histological sections were stained with hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) mRNA was extracted from the mouse ear using Isogen. the ear skins sampled on day 21 were snap-frozen, and the frozen sections prepared at 7 m thickness were subjected to a blocking procedure with 5% normal goat serum. sections were then incubated with FITC-conjugated rat anti-mouse CD4 antibody and PE conjugated anti-mouse FoxP3 antibody (BioLegend) mice were intra-nasally inoculated with rhPIV2/EGFP (5106 TCID50) the intense EGFP expression was revealed in the lung epithelium of the mice. rhPIV2/EGFP was visualized clearly in the airway epithelial cells 4 days after administration. the intranasal and subcutaneous administration of the rhPIV2/Ag85B (Ag nasal and Ag ear on the panel) significantly reduced skin reactions in rhPIV2/Ag85B treated mice. ear thickness measured before and 6 hours after each OX application on day 21. IgE levels were detected in sera from rhPIV2/Ag85B-treated mice. mRNA expression was significantly decreased in intra-nasal rhPIV2/Ag85B and rhPIV2-vector groups. no obvious suppression in IL-17 mRNA expression was detected in rhPIV2/Ag85B. expression levels of mRNA of IL-4, TNF- and MIP2- mRNA significantly decreased in rhPIV2/Ag85B treated group compared to those of control groups. mRNA expression levels of mRNA of IFN-, IL-10, TGF- and IL-2 were significantly elevated in rhPIV2/Ag85B intra-nasally treated group. the number of Foxp3+CD4+ T cells in the inflamed ear skin is significantly increased in both of the intra-nasal and ear-subcutaneous rhPIV2/Ag85B application groups. rhPIV2/EGFP infected mice with rhPIV2/EGFP at an MOI of 0.5. rhPIV2/Ag85B-treated mice developed severe erythema with exudation and erosion at 6 hours after OX challenge on day 21. however, rhPIV2/Ag85B-treatment reduced dermatitis in both of the intra-nasal and subcutaneous application groups. ear thickness measured before and 6 hours after each OX application on day 21. plasma IgE levels decreased in rhPIV2/Ag85B treated groups. inflammatory cells and epidermal thickness decreased in rhPIV2/Ag85B treated groups. inflammatory reactions with acanthosis and ulceration in epidermis. expressions of IL-2 mRNA significantly decreased in intra-nasal rhPIV2/Ag85B treated groups compared with PBS or vector treated group. no obvious suppression in IL-17 mRNA expression was detected in rhPIV2/Ag85B group. expression levels of IL-4, TNF- and MIP2- mRNA significantly elevated in rhPIV2/Ag85B intra-nasally treated group. the skin infiltrating CD4+ T cells are significantly decreased in Ag nasal group and Ag ear group. the number of skin infiltrating CD4+ T cells is less in Ag nasal group compared to that of PBS-treated group. the cutaneous Th1 cytokine milieu to Th2 represents the characteristic immunological features of AD. we investigated effects of vaccination using replication-deficient rhPIV2 vector expressing Ag85B gene to mouse AD model. hPIV2 is suspected as less virulent and cytotoxic virus. hPIV2 has a non-segmented and negative-stranded RNA genome. there is no antigenic shift among RNA segments, not like retrovirus. hPIV2 is a virus infectious to the respiratory tract mucosa. present study unveiled augmentation of TGF- and IL-10 expression by intranasal rhPIV2/Ag85B. TGF- and IL-10 have been described as critical regulatory cytokines produced by Treg."}
