{"summary": "the pericollapse stage of osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is a continuous period in the development of ONFH from the occurrence of subchondral fracture to early collapse (2 mm), with specific imaging features that consist of bone marrow edema and crescent signs on X-ray films. the pericollapse stage with distinct clinical and imaging characteristics provides a last good opportunity for the use of joint-preserving techniques. a total hip arthroplasty (THA) is often the last and most reliable option. those with nontraumatic ONFH tend to be younger and physically more active. a successful joint-preserving procedure depends on accurate and early diagnosis. the three most commonly used grading systems for the evaluation of ONFH include the Ficat system, ARCO system, and Steinberg system. the classification system mainly considers collapse observed on standard radiographs, making it impossible to quantify the lesion size and assess disease progression. authors of review articles tend to use Ficat Stages II\u2013III or ARCO Stages II\u2013III ONFH to approximately evaluate the pericollapse period. the pericollapse stage should be able to discriminate between reversible and progressive ONFH lesions, providing the opportunity for joint-preserving procedures. meier et al. analyzed 37 symptomatic hips in 27 consecutive adult patients. only 19 cases showed fracture lines on MRI, but subchondral fractures were observed in all patients on MRI. most patients are first referred to orthopedists due to these symptoms and signs. the presence of BME on short-tau inversion recovery (STIR) and accompanied joint effusion on MRI may indicate a high possibility of the appearance of a subchondral fracture. the gold standard technique for diagnosing the pericollapse stage remains CT. stress concentration between the sclerotic band and necrotic area causes a loss of structural stability of the femoral head. the subchondral fracture impairs the immobilization function of subchondral bone to articular cartilage and initiates head collapse. the subchondral plate and secondary compaction of necrotic cancellous bone result in the formation of a cavum below the subchondral plate. 70% of patients with glucocorticoid-induced ONFH eventually progressed to head collapse, even though edema might resolve later during follow-up. surprisingly, of 24 patients without BME, only one collapse was observed. many theories have been proposed, but no mechanism has been authenticated for the development of BME. avation of clinical symptoms in the pericollapse stage include deteriorative structural instability of the femoral head, enhanced secretion of inflammatory mediators, increased intramedullary pressure, and hyperstatic pressure caused by joint effusion. avation of clinical symptoms in the pericollapse stage include deteriorative structural instability of the femoral head, enhanced secretion of inflammatory mediators, increased intramedullary pressure, etc. the three-pillar structure theory of the femoral head and china-Japan Friendship Hospital classification system is shown. the medial pillar, central pillar, and lateral pillar represent 30%, 40%, and 30% of the femoral head respectively. preservation of the lateral pillar is the keystone for forestalling the collapse of the femoral head. 31 asymptomatic ONFH hips that finally progressed to symptomatic ones, 26 (83.8%) collapsed with a mean time of 8 months (range, 1\u201336 months) the duration of the pericollapse stage should be further confirmed by long-term follow-up. asymptomatic ONFH patients were 30 months (range, 1\u2013134 months). the natural progression of SARS patients from ONFH onset to the pericollapse stage Stage Type M Type C Type L1 Type L2 Type L3 Pericollapse/total patients 0/13 6/45 20/89 9/9 31/36 Percentage 0.0 13.3 22.5 100.0 86.1 Time needed, n 1 year / / 2 5 2 years / / 1 2 13 3 the therapeutic regimen for ONFH should be decided by classification, stages, and risk factors rather than symptoms. any lesions susceptible to collapse need to be managed as soon as possible to regain structural stability of the femoral head and therefore halt the ongoing progression. femoral osteotomy aims to transpose the healthy portion of the femoral head to the weight-bearing area and therefore restore joint congruity. NVBG is more suitable for ONFH patients of a young age (40 years), low body mass index (25 kg/m2) and early-stage lesions. a study of vascularized iliac bone grafting reported a 66.7% (8/12) success (no progression) rate with a follow-up duration of more than 3 years for the Steinberg Stage III hips but only 37.5% for Steinberg Stage IV hips. only 45% (9/20) of Steinberg Stage IV cases improved after the operation. the pericollapse stage should end with a head collapse more than 2 mm instead of 4 mm. for the CJFH L2 and L3 types, the pericollapse stage lesions in patients aged >50 years with severe pain and joint disturbance.
