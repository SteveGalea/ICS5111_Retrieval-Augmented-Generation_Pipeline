{"summary": "Background Influenza is a respiratory disease that seriously threatens human health. it is characterized as rapid prevalence, wide dissemination, acute incidence and huge hazard. immunosuppression drugs should also be included in infection treatment. there are 3-5 million severe influenza cases and 250,000-500,000 mortality every year. influenza pandemias happened for four times in the 20th century. more than 10,000 people died of H1N1 flu in 2009. complement activation can produce inflammatory media including C2a, C3a, C4a and C5a. c3a, iC3b, C3d and C5b67 have chemotaxis function. CR2 is the central molecule for the immune response regulation by complement system. complement activation can influence pulmonary infiltration and lung injury degree. complement activation can influence pulmonary infiltration and lung injury degree. complement activation can influence pulmonary infiltration and lung injury degree. complement inhibits excessive inflammatory reaction in lung tissues induced by influenza. complement activation can produce inflammatory media including C2a, C3a, C4a and C5a. complement activation can produce inflammatory media including C2a, C3a and kinin-like function. c3a, C5a and C5b67 have chemotaxis function, and can attract inflammatory cells to concentrate and migrate toward the inflammatory region activated by the complement. CR2 is a good choice as a tarteting vector for delivery of complement inhibitors such as Crry and CD59 to sites of inflammation induced by complement activation. complement inhibitors are targeted to complement activation sites with CR2 as targeting vector. complement inhibitors like CD59 and Crry are targeted to inflammatory sites to specially inhibit the complement activation in the local injury. complement inhibitors like CD59 and Crry (CR2-CD59, CR2-Crry) are targeted to inflammatory sites to inhibit the complement activation in the local injury. mice are applied to inhale mouse lung-adapted strain of H1N1 influenza A virus. mice are then treated with CR2 targeting complement inhibitors. final work is to observe survival and lung tissue injury of the mice. authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
