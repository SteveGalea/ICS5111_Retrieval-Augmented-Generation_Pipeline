{"summary": "severe cases of emerging human adenovirus type 55 (HAdV-55) in immunocompetent adults have been reported sporadically in china. clinical features and outcomes of most critically ill patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by HAdV-55 requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) are lacking. bilateral consolidations and infiltrates are the most frequent clinical manifestations of HAdV-55-induced severe ARDS. ECMO may still be the respiratory support therapy of choice."}
