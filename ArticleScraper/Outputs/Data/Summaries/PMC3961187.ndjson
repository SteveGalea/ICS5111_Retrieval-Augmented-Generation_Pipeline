{"summary": "bartonella spp. and leptospira spp. conducted first comparative host\u2013pathogen coevolutionary analyses of bacterial pathogens in bats and rodents. we used published genetic data for 51 Bartonella genotypes from 24 bat species, 129 Bartonella from 38 rodents and 26 Leptospira from 20 bats. bats and rodents are the two most diverse and geographically widespread orders of mammals. they are reservoir hosts of several viral pathogens of high consequence, including Henipaviruses, Ebola and Marburg viruses, lyssaviruses, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus, plague and other bacterial zoonoses. ecological, evolutionary, and life-history traits can influence pathogen richness and cross species transmission, or spillover, in these bat and rodent hosts [5], [8]\u2013[11]. anthropogenic alterations that increase exposure to bats and rodents, including expanding agricultural operations, bushmeat hunting, and climate change, may increase the opportunity for diseases to emerge in humans. bartonella has been reported with high prevalence and genetic diversity from numerous recent studies in bats [22]\u2013[25] and rodents [26]\u2013[30]. genetic studies have indicated highly similar strains between infected humans and nearby rodent populations [31]\u2013[34]. evidence of cophylogeny can be used to test hypotheses of coevolution. lack of congruence between host and pathogen phylogenies can identify pathogen spillover, or interspecific transmission, events. evolutionary events including strict codivergence, parasite duplication, parasite extinction, and parasite host switching, will strengthen or diminish congruence between host and parasite. bartonella and leptospira sequences from bat or rodent hosts identified to the species level were compiled into our datasets. we also conduct event-based cophylogeny analyses to reconstruct likely evolutionary histories for each group of pathogens and hosts. ys, Peromyscus, Psammomys, Rattus, Rhabdomys, Sekeetamys, Spermophilus, Tamias, Tamiasciurus, Tatera, and Urocitellus genera were included in the dataset. the largest comparable genetic dataset consisted of the partial citrate synthase gene (gltA) for bartonella and 16S rRNA gene for Leptospira tospira genotypes (19 New World, 7 Old World) from 20 bat species. insufficient genetic data of one gene for Leptospira in rodents precluded use. only leptospira in bat hosts was examined. the number of bootstrap replicates was determined using the previously described stopping criteria. we used a GTR+I+G substitution model with 10,000,000 generations. tanglegrams were generated from the best ML trees in TreeMap 3.0 [66] PACo differs from ParaFit by utilizing Procrustean superimposition. the parasite matrix is rotated and scaled to fit the host matrix. we then used event-based program Jane 4 [73] to determine the most probable coevolutionary history of the associated host and parasites. otis, Nyctalus, Otomops, Phyllostomus, Promops, Pteronotus, Rousettus, Rhinophylla, Sturnira, Triaenops, Uroderma, and Vampyressa genera. only unique genotypes were included in the dataset. in total, we compiled sequences from 51 bartonella genotypes (38 New World, 13 Old World) from 24 bat species (15 New World, 9 Old World), and 129 (20 New World, 109 Old World) bartonella genotypes from 38 rodent species (4 New World, 35 Old World) insufficient genetic data of one gene for Leptospira in rodents precluded their use in the analysis. maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic trees were generated using RAxML 7.0.4 [64]. the number of bootstrap replicates were determined using the previously described stopping criteria. the number of bootstrap replicates were determined using the previously described stopping criteria. ParaFit analyses [68] were performed in R using package ape [70] with 999 permutations to implement a global test. each individual host-bacteria interaction is determined to be significant if either its ParaFit 1 or Parafit 2 p-value0.05. PACo differs from ParaFit by utilizing Procrustean superimposition. phylogenies tend to be well supported for more recent divergence events. nodes with bootstrap values 50 labeled on all tanglegrams. maximum likelihood phylogenies for Bartonella bacteria (yellow) and their new world bat hosts (blue) analyses of Bartonella and bats provided evidence for co-evolution. a substantial proportion of specific host-parasite links were non-significant. the separate analyses of new world and old world bat associated Bartonella indicated evidence for overall coevolution with host species. ParaFit and PACo analyses of Bartonella and rodent phylogenies also indicated strong overall patterns of cospeciation. 94/140 individual host-parasite links were significant based on ParaFit1 values and P0.05. all host-pathogen associations are shown in the tanglegram as black connecting lines. black lines indicate significant individual cospeciation links between Bartonella and their hosts. gray lines indicate significant individual cospeciation links as indicated by ParaFit (P0.05), while gray lines are non-significant links. event-based cophylogeny Based on a default cost setting, we calculated the optimal number of each type of coevolutionary event, to minimize total cost, for each host-pathogen association. the resulting ratios can then be compared across the different associations in order to see the overall impact of each event given the number of parasites. dents-Bartonella had nearly twice as many host switches per parasite in New World (0.474) as compared to Old World bats (0.278). bartonella in rodents had the opposite trend, with more than twice as many host switches per parasite in Old World (0.339) as compared to New World rodents (0.150). bootstrap support values 50 labeled, rooted with outgroups. all host-pathogen associations are shown in the tanglegram as gray and black connecting lines. phyllostomus hastatus substituted for Phyllostomus discolor. twenty-six of 51 individual host-parasite links are significant based on either a ParaFit1 or Parafit2 value of P0.05. a substantial proportion of specific host-parasite links were non-significant. the separate analyses of new world and old world bat associated Bartonella indicated evidence for overall coevolution with host species. tGlobal = 102.4409, P0.001; m2 global value = 86.532, P0.0001) for the entire rodent-Bartonella dataset, 94/140 individual host-parasite links were significant based on ParaFit1 values and P0.05. the separate analyses for the new world and Old World rodent hosts with associated Bartonella both indicated evidence for significant overall coevolution. ParaFit and PACo analyses of leptospira and bats were unable to reject the hypothesis of independence of speciation events. based on ParaFit1 values, only 1 of 26 individual host-parasite links is significant based on P0.05. ParaFit and PACo analyses of Bartonella and bats provided evidence for significant co-evolution between bats and bats. a substantial proportion of specific host-parasite links were non-significant. the separate analyses of new world and old world bat associated Bartonella both indicated evidence for overall coevolution with host species. ParaFit and PACo analyses of Bartonella and rodent phylogenies also indicated strong overall patterns of cospeciation. 94/140 individual host-parasite links were significant based on ParaFit1 values and P0.05. for the entire rodent-Bartonella dataset, global values from both were significant. all host-pathogen associations are shown in the tanglegram as gray and black connecting lines. black lines indicate significant individual cospeciation links between Bartonella and their hosts as indicated by ParaFit (P0.05) Phyllostomus hastatus substituted for Phyllostomus discolor, Promops centralis for Promops nasutus. event-based cophylogeny Based on a default cost setting, we calculated the optimal number of each type of coevolutionary event, to minimize total cost, for each host-pathogen association. bartonella in rodents had the opposite trend, with more than twice as many host switches per parasite in Old World (0.339) as compared to New World rodents (0.150) the differences between old and new world cophylogenetic patterns for both host switches and cospeciations were minimal. the evolutionary pattern in bat hosts is driven mostly by a few host-parasite interactions. a greater proportion, 67%, of the individual rodent-bacteria associations are significant. in the new world association of rodents and bartonella, a full 100% of the host-parasite links were significant. the number of cospeciations per parasite is also the highest for leptospira and bats. this suggests that for the bat-Leptospira system, coevolutionary relationships are driven mostly strongly by the host switching events rather than cospeciation. our findings suggest that host switching is an \u201cexpensive\u201d evolutionary event. bartonella is an intracellular bacteria which can survive only within erythrocytes and endothelial cells. this requires a finer adaptation to the host's cells in order for bacterial penetration. this requires a finer adaptation to the host's cells in order for bacterial penetration. lack of coevolutionary patterns in the leptospira lineages is warranted. previous research in bats had indicated host specificity in the Old World but not New World for Bartonella [24]. a greater degree of congruence between host-bacteria phylogenies in the Old world may be due to longer evolutionary time for mutualistic relationships with mammalian hosts. a number of bat species form large multi-species gatherings. they are more likely to have direct ecological overlap between host species. at sites across the tropics, an extraordinary number of bat species can exist in sympatry, e.g. >70 species sharing tropical forest habitat in Krau Wildlife Reserve, Malaysia [85] future data collection and analyses should focus on arthropod vector host specificity and phylogenetic relationships to better predict specificity within bartonella and leptospira. the application of spatial analyses of wildlife hosts will provide valuable information on transmission potential based on the role of contact vs. cophylogeny. the number of publications pertaining to viral (red) and bacterial (blue) disease research in bats (dotted) and rodents (solid) in each year from 1993 to 2012 using combinations of keywords bat OR Chiroptera*, rodent*, bacteria*, virus* OR vira*.
