{"summary": "orthopoxviruses (family Poxviridae, genus Orthopoxvirus) contain a covalently closed, double-stranded DNA genome of approximately 200 kbp. the genus is comprised of at least 10 recognized species. several viruses within this group are significant human pathogens. Vaccinia virus is famous for being the vaccine that was used to eradicate smallpox. it was also the first animal virus to be purified and chemically analyzed. despite its notoriety, its origin and natural history remain obscure. lightCycler-based PCR assays have been developed for pan-Orthopoxvirus or specific orthopoxvirus species detection [19], [20], [21]. a rapid, high-throughput, multi-locus method for identifying orthopoxviruses based on PCR amplification followed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS) performed on the Ibis T5000 instrument [22], [23], the primer 5 prime sequence shows the addition of non-homlogous nucleotides to increase the Tm of the primers. the primer 5 prime sequence shows the addition of non-homlogous nucleotides to increase the Tm of the primers. all four primer pairs produce amplicon that can distinguish Variola virus from any other orthopoxvirus. primer pair VIR982, VIR985 and VIR988 could resolve the two strains of monkeypox tested: VR-267 and Zaire-96-1-16. four PCR primers in the assay enabled the detection and identification of an orthopoxvirus at the stochastic limit of PCR: 4\u20138 copies/PCR reaction. if only 4\u20138 genomes/PCR are used there is a very high probability at least one of the four primers would detect the virus. the most sensitive primer pair, VIR985, detected eight genomic copies of rabbitpox genome isolated from infected rabbit blood. the diluted DNA extract would equate to less than 2 PFU/mL of blood. the three additional primer pairs are sensitive to 30 genomes per PCR reaction. primer pair VIR982 exhibited the greatest analytical sensitivity of the four primers in the assay. for each primer region, a database of expected base compositions (A, G, C, and T base counts) from all known orthopoxvirus sequences in GenBank was generated. the primer 5 prime sequence shows the addition of non-homlogous nucleotides to increase the Tm of the primers after the first PCR cycles. all experimentally determined base-count signatures were found to agree with bioinformatically predicted signatures based on published genomic sequences. the number in the columns under the primer pair ID indicates the numbers of each base (A, G, C, and T) in the PCR amplicons generated from the target virus. if only 4\u20138 genomes/PCR are used in the assay there is a very high probability that at least one of the four primers would detect the virus. the calibrant is present in every PCR reaction at 100 copies. the first blood sample evaluated was found to have 4103 plaque forming units (PFU) per mL of blood as determined by a plaque assay on Vero cells. DNA extract from this sample was analyzed by real-time PCR. orthopoxviruses are principally rare zoonotic pathogens, but historically Variola was a devastating human pathogen. it is also possible that a zoonotic orthopoxvirus could emerge as a variola-like virus of humans or be used as a bioterrorist agent. the assay is simple and can be performed using premade PCR plates that contain all reaction components except genome. the system can process 16 plates in a 24 hour period for a total throughput of 384 samples per day. such throughput is essential for surveillance and in times of an epidemic outbreak or acts of bioterrorism.

PCR The following PCR conditions were used on MJ dyad 96-well thermocyclers. the calibrant sequence contains a five-base pair (bp) deletion within the amplicon so that the calibrant amplicons could readily be resolved from the viral template-derived amplicon. aliquots of each PCR reaction were desalted and purified using a weak anion exchange protocol described elsewhere. the manufacturers recommended procedure (Qiagen Inc, Valencia, CA), according to the manufacturers recommended procedure (Qiagen Inc, Valencia, CA).
