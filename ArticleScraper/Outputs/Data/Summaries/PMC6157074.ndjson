{"summary": "computational resources are becoming increasingly important for classifying and analyzing this resource. graph theory defines an Atlas classification scheme for automatically categorizing certain protein substructures. results Focusing on the -helical coiled coils, we present a suite of computational resources. the need for protein-structure classification is clear. such classifications demonstrate the structural diversity exhibited by proteins in nature. such classifications provide inspiration for protein designers to identify structures that are not yet present in these schemes. coiled coils comprise two or more helices that pack tightly together via interdigitation of side chains in a geometry known as knobs-into-holes (KIH) packing. a knob is a side chain projecting from one helix that packs into the hole formed by four side chains on an adjacent helix. coiled coils are present in up to 10% of eukaryotic proteins. there are clear gaps in the first row of the PTCC beyond the classical and abundant coiled-coil dimers, trimers and tetramers. the 'dark matter' of coiled coils is not explicitly defined in the PTCC, making it difficult to identify the next design challenges. cut is a user-defined maximum for distances d1 through d4 between the centres of mass of the side chains that define the hole. a pair of interacting helices must have a total KIH interactions of >kcut. coiled-coil structures are abundant and take on a variety of structural forms. graph theory has been used in the form of Protein Structure Networks (Bhattacharyya et al., 2016), for studying the rigidity of proteins (Sim et al., 2015), for studying the evolutionary constraints on amino-acid mutation (Parente et al., 2015), comparing spatial arrangements of secondary structure elements (Grindley et al., 1993), and representing pathways of protein\u2013protein interactions (Huang et al., 2014). the web-interface for the Atlas of Coiled Coils is interactive and allows the user to visually inspect the classification and, by adjusting geometric parameters, to probe the variation in helical packing across the PDB. we highlight the automatic identification and classification of a subset of previously unclassified coiled-coil structures. the core iSOCKET algorithm and associated convenience functions are available as the knobs_into_holes add-on module for ISAMBARD. iSOCKET builds on the AMPAL framework that ISAMBARD uses for representing biomolecules computationally. online tutorials are freely available as part of the web application source code. iSOCKET was used to find KIH interactions within protein structures. iSOCKET follows a similar procedure for identifying knobs-into-holes interactions to that described fully in the original SOCKET paper. the parameter scut offers one method of filtering the KIH interactions that are detected. the object-oriented nature of iSOCKET allows the user direct access to the KIH interactions. the core iSOCKET algorithm and associated convenience functions are available as the knobs_into_holes add-on module for ISAMBARD. iSOCKET was conceived and written as an open-source Python-based application programming interface (API) for identifying and analyzing side-chain packing in protein structures. iSOCKET was filtered for canonical, non-redundant coiled coils with at least 11 residues. iSOCKET gives several advantages over the foregoing program. the original program required a user-defined distance cutoff for assigning KIH (default 7.0) the updated program collects all KIH at a deliberately large distance cut-off value (10 ). this allows the user to select any threshold below this. each node in the graph must have at least one edge associated with it. the connected subgraphs are classified individually, since each represents exactly one coiled coil. it is straightforward to represent the mathematical graph in the form of a simple diagram. the first seven graphs (omitting the trivial graph G0) are shown in the top row. the graphs G16, G38, G105 and G353 are disconnected. each pair of nodes in G1252 is connected by an edge. the graphs associated with a coiled-coil dimer, a hexameric barrel and the complex coiled coil in Figure 1 are \u2018G3\u2019, \u2018G105\u2019 and \u2018G163\u2019 respectively. a structure containing a separate dimer and trimer has two connected components: \u2018G3\u2019 and \u2018G7\u2019. Atlas of Coiled Coils is an automated coiled-coil classification scheme. we formalized the notion that true coiled-coil packing is formed between pairs of helices that share multiple tightly packed KIH interactions. the knob cutoff requires that there are more than kcut KIH interactions between each pair of helices defined to be associating in the coiled coil. each graph represents a category within the classification scheme. unshaded graphs represent the unpopulated categories, i.e. the aforementioned structural \u2018dark matter\u2019 of coiled-coil space. in the online version, a mouse-over hover tool can be used to display the name of each graph, the number of corresponding coiled coils and the percentage of the total population that this represents. slides allow the user to filter the coiled-coil data dynamically and observe the resulting changes to the classification. figure 4A includes 4 examples of heptameric barrels, adding to the'slipped heptamer' seven-helix coiled-coil in the PTCC. the distribution in the new Atlas of Coiled Coils is similar with 62% dimers. the five most densely populated categories are the same as the PTCC. the proportion was reduced in the former to just 27%. at this highly permissive cutoff combination, loose packing between proximal helices is included and the resulting graphs may not represent tightly packed coiled coils. iSOCKET and the Atlas of Coiled Coils classify -helical barrels. iSOCKET and the Atlas identify and classify -helical barrels. iSOCKET and the Atlas of coiled-coils classification scheme. iSOCKET automatically identifies coiled coils iS. the largest barrel, containing 39 helices, is in the 10 MDa vault ribonucleoprotein particle. iSOCKET was conceived and written as an open-source Python-based application programming interface (API) it allows non-expert users to analyze coiled-coil packing in an intuitive way. the core algorithm for detecting knobs-into-holes (KIH) interactions is similar to that of the original program. the object-oriented basis of iSOCKET allows coiled coils to be classified automatically following the Atlas Classification. each node in the graph must have at least one edge associated with it, but the entire graph need not be connected. coiled-coil graphs identified using iSOCKET are categorized according to their position in the Atlas of Graphs. the first seven graphs (omitting the trivial graph G0) are shown in the top row, and a selection of later graphs are shown in the bottom row. iSOCKET is used to find KIH interactions within a protein structure. this is converted to a simple graph and each of its connected components is classified separately via isomorphism to the Atlas of Graphs. a structure containing a separate dimer and trimer has two connected components: \u2018G3\u2019 and \u2018G7\u2019. coiled-coil structures can be categorized in this way. iSOCKET is used to identify graphs of KIH interactions within the protein structure. if no isomorph is found, the Atlas of Graphs is extended. the resulting classification, the Atlas of Coiled Coils, serves as an automatic update to the PTCC (Moutevelis and Woolfson, 2009). each graph represents a category within the classification scheme. each graph represents a category within the classification scheme. coiled-coil graphs are shown at the indicated values of scut (kcut = 2 in each case) in the online version, a mouse-over hover tool can be used to display the name of each graph, the number of corresponding coiled coils and the percentage of the total population that this represents. populated graphs include G163 (second row, final column) and the cyclic graph for the hexameric barrel (bottom row, third column) there are currently 17 and 7 examples in the original PTCC. this highlights both the increase in structural data available, and recent successes in designing -helical barrel structures. increasing scut or lowering kcut increased both the number and the variety of coiled coils detected. as more KIH interactions were identified there was an increased likelihood of peripheral helices being included in more-complex coiled coils. the proportion was reduced in the former to just 27%. kcut = 2 and setting scut = 7.0, 7.5 and 8.0 resulted in three different graphs. at low scut, only the central trimer was detected, but as it was increased, interactions were also found between the helices of the trimer and three outer helices. iSOCKET algorithm does not interpret coiled-coil-barrel assemblies that have more than 6 helices, instead detecting a series of dimers. larger cycles are not part of the Atlas of Graphs and so barrels with more than 7 helices are not represented. the largest barrel, containing 39 helices, is in the 10 MDa vault ribonucleoprotein particle (4hl8) the largest barrel, containing 39 helices, is in the 10 MDa vault ribonucleoprotein particle (4hl8) the code is modular, extensible and open-source. coiled coils are shown in the context of all possible coiled-coil structures. in the PTCC dark-matter structures can only be inferred by their absence. this is difficult using the PTCC, and entirely impractical to do. the 'dark matter' of coiled-coil space should be aided by recent developments in modelling and parametric protein design. the explicit \u2018dark matter\u2019 in the Atlas highlights the scale of the challenge faced by protein designers. the classification protocol that follows is entirely generic, i.e. independent of the secondary structure type(s) that the structure comprises. the nodes need not be secondary structure elements at all: they could be domains, or chains within a larger protein complex."}
