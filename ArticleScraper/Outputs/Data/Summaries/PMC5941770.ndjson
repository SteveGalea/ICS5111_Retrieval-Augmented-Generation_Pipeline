{"summary": "the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a crucial site involved in maintaining cellular functions, such as synthesis, modification, releases and translocation of proteins, biosynthesis of steroids, cholesterol and other lipids. many physiological and pathological conditions including imbalance in the ER folding capacity, accumulation of misfolded proteins, altered cellular metabolism, hypoxia, oxidative stress, infection, disruption of ER calcium ion balance, can trigger the ER stress. IRE1 has functions of endoribonuclease and serine-threonine kinase. an endoribonuclease activity of IRE1 is a specific splicing of the XBP1 mRNA. XBP1s has a major role in protein-refolding, ER-associated degradation system, lipid metabolism, and proinflammatory responses. PERK and ATF6 induce ERK, p38 and JNK activation. also activates NF-kappaB via phosphorylation of the Akt. TLR4 tightly controls the ATF4-CHOP branch and prevents induction of CHOP expression in macrophages. TRAF3 interacts with both MyD88 and TRIF. but it differentially regulates MAPK signaling pathway and type I IFN signaling pathway. blockade of TRAF3 ubiquitination inhibits proinflammatory cytokine production. ER stress-induced inflammation in white adipose tissue in obese mice. ER stress shares TLR-mediated signaling components with pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine productions. NF-kappaB and MAPK Activations in inflammatory cytokines by ER Stress UPR is an important modulator in the induction of inflammatory cytokines. ER stress induces proinflammatory cytokines, IL-6, IL-1, TNF-, and IL-8 through NF-kappaB activation. the IRE1 can activate JNK in a TRAF2-dependent manner. ER stress induces phosphorylation of ERK, p38, and ERK. IRE1 branch in ER transmembrane is oligomerized and autophosphorylated. thapsigargin and dithiothreitol induced proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 in a NOD1/2-dependent manner. studies suggest NOD1/2 activation with TLR is a new mechanism for ER stress-induced proinflammatory cytokines. ER stress inducers (tunicamycin and thapsigargin) induce pro-IL-1 and NACHT, leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and pyrin domain- (PYD-) containing protein 3 (NLRP3) expression and ER stress inducers-mediated ROS can trigger thioredoxin- (TRX-) interacting protein (TXNIP) dissociation from TRX to interaction with LRR and NACHT domain of NL ER stress regulates IL-1 and IL-18 production during chemical stress or microbial infection through canonical and noncanonical inflammasome activation. the inhibition of GSK-3 was shown to protect the host from several inflammatory diseases such as colitis and arthritis. PI3K-Akt pathway has been shown to negatively regulate proinflammatory cytokine production through GSK-3 inactivation. inhibition of PI3K-Akt pathway enhances LPS-induced TNF- production through MAPKs (ERK, p38, and JNK) also reduces LPS-induced TNF- in PBMCs and THP-1 monocytic cells. IRE1-mediated activation induces transcription of IL-1 but inhibits XBP1 splicing. SB216763, a GSK-3 inhibitor, selectively inhibits IL-1 gene expression. IRE1-mediated XBP1 activation results in the transcription of TNF-. stress enhances proinflammatory cytokine production through modulating TLR signaling. toll-like receptor-mediated activation of intracellular signaling pathways results in increased production of proinflammatory cytokines including TNF-, IL-6, and IL-1. the synergic effect is mainly mediated by the activation of p38 and ERK via PERK and up-regulated p38 expression via ATF6. ER stress inducer significantly augments LPS-induced proinflammatory cytokines (i.e., TNF-, IL-1, and IL-6). inflammatory response due to ER stress is frequently observed in the development of nonmalignant immunological disorders. evidences have shown that ER stress enhances TLR-induced intracellular cascades to produce proinflammatory cytokines. more research is needed to understand the role of ER stress in host immune responses. there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this article."}
