{"summary": "foot-and-mouth disease is one of the most economically and socially devastating diseases affecting cloven-hoofed animals. the infectious agent, foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), is a member of the Aphthovirus genus of the Picornaviridae family. it contains single-stranded positive-sense RNA genomes of about 8,500 nucleotides. phosphate acts as an inhibitor of inosine 5\u2032-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) and guanosine monophosphate synthetase [8]. phosphate acts as an inhibitor of inosine 5\u2032-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) and guanosine monophosphate synthetase [8]. phosphate acts as an inhibitor of inosine 5\u2032-monophosphate 50, 75, and 100 M, respectively, and the 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) of mizoribine was estimated to be more than 100 M on IBRS-2 cells. inhibition rates were approximately 63.01%, 82.03%, 90.89%, and 90.41% in cells treated with 25, 50, 75, and 100 M mizoribine. the transcription of FMDV mRNA was significantly reduced with 25, 50, 75, and 100 M mizoribine treatments relative to the DMSO control group. mizoribine inhibited the expression of FMDV protein in a dose-dependent manner. vir levels were determined at 48 hpi by (A) Q-PCR and (B) Western blot. \u201cVC\u201d represents those cells treated with 1% DMSO without mizoribine. values represent the mean standard deviation for three independent experiments. all the solvent-treated mice died within 60 h after 100 LD50 of O/MY98/BY/2010 challenge. a 48-h delay in death post-infection was noted in the mizoribine-treated group. the overall death time of mice treated with mizoribine was delayed by 48 h. mice treated with mizoribine at 34 hpi were sacrificed at 34 h post-challenge. the pathological changes of heart tissues were observed after H&E staining. tissue damage was identified and is indicated by black arrows. inhibition rates were approximately 63.01%, 82.03%, 90.89%, and 90.41% in cells treated with 25, 50, 75, and 100 M mizoribine respectively. other lower mizoribine concentrations showed limited or no inhibitory effect on FMDV. mizoribine inhibited the expression of FMDV protein in a dose-dependent manner. the concentration of 75 M showed more protection against CPE than other concentrations. asterisks indicate significant differences between mock-treated and drug-treated cells. s represent the mean SD of three independent experiments. a 48-h delay in death post-infection was noted in the mizoribine-treated group. all the mice died within 108 h after the viral challenge. the overall death time of mice treated with mizoribine was delayed. tissues were observed after H&E staining at 34 h post-challenge. tissue was then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution, paraffin embedded, sectioned, and stained with H&E. qPCR and IFA findings revealed that mizoribine can significantly inhibit the viral mRNA and FMDV protein levels. the antiviral activity of mizoribine against FMDV was found to be attenuated by guanosine supplementation. mizoribine has been reported to be active against the replication of BVDV in bovine kidney cells. a combination of interferons (IFNs) and mizoribine had been noted to synergistically inhibit BVDV replication in bovine kidney cells [17]. future studies must investigate whether a combination of IFNs and mizoribine could produce increased inhibitory effect on FMDV replication both in vitro and in vivo. anti-actin mouse polyclonal antibody purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG or anti-rabbit IgG purchased from ZSGB. FMDV type O (O/MYA98/BY/2010) strain was used for viral challenge. cells were seeded into each well of a 96-well plate containing 100 L of complete medium. cells were incubated with 100 L of mizoribine at various concentrations (6, 12, 25, 50, 75, and 100 M) inhibition rate was calculated as follows: inhibition rate = (optical density of mizoribine group optical density of VC)/(optical density of cell control group optical density of VC) 100%. the viral 2B mRNA was analyzed using Q-PCR. -2 cells were extracted using TRizol reagent, and 1 g of RNA was used in reverse transcription reaction using a reagent kit containing gDNA Eraser. amplification conditions were as follows: 95 \u00b0C for 30 s, followed by 40 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 5 s, 56 \u00b0C for 30 s, and 72 \u00b0C for 30 s. the cells were incubated with 100 TCID50 FMDV for 1 h. mizoribine diluted at indicated concentrations was added to the cells. after 12 h of incubation, the cells were washed thrice with PBS. the suckling mice were euthanized and processed for histological and immunohistochemical investigations. at 34 h post-infection, the heart tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution, embedded in paraffin. IBRS-2 (swine kidney cell line) cells were preserved in our laboratory. the cells were cultured in complete Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium. the cells were maintained in 5% CO2 at 37 \u00b0C. laboratory animals Thirty-two (32) two- and three-day-old BALB/c mice weighing 3\u20134 g were used to investigate the efficacy of mizoribine in vivo. the cytotoxicity of mizoribine was evaluated using MTS assay. the cells were seeded in 96-well plates infected with 100 TCID50 FMDV O/MY98/BY/2010 at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. a 75 M portion of mizoribine supplemented with serial dilutions of guanosine (from 100 to 25 M) was added and incubated for 48 h. the expression levels of FMDV 2B mRNA and VP1 protein in the cells were determined by real-time PCR as previously reported. the total RNA from the IBRS-2 cells was extracted using TRizol reagent, and 1 g of RNA was used in reverse transcription reaction. the membranes were incubated with goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit conjugated with horseradish peroxidase for 1 h at room temperature and examined by PierceTM ECL Western Blotting Substrate. indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) was performed as previously described with minor modifications. three-day-old Kunming suckling mice were inoculated with 50 g of mizoribine dissolved in 10 M DMSO, 5% Tween 80, and 0.1 mL of PBS by subcutaneous neck injection. after 2 h, viral challenge was performed by intradermal injection with 100 50% lethal dose (LD50) Statistical Analysis All the data are expressed as mean standard deviation (SD) for at least three independent experiments. one-way ANOVA was used to analyze the difference between mizoribine and control groups."}
