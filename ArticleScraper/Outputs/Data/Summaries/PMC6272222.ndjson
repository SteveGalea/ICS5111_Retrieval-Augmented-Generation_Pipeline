{"summary": "loop-mediated isothermal amplification can specifically, sensitively and rapidly amplify nucleic acids with two pairs of primers recognizing 6 independent sequences of a target gene under isothermal conditions. the method has the advantage of specificity, selectivity, and rapidity over polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [3,4], nucleic acid sequence based amplification (NASBA) [5,6], strand displacement amplification (SDA) [7], rolling circle amplification ( non-specific amplification occurred in the isothermal amplification of four primer combinations out of seven combinations. analysis on the three combinations indicated that they had the common situation that 3\u20134 bases at 3' end of both primers had two complementary sequences on a same primer. non-specific amplification caused by primer dimers was one reason for false positive results of LAMP. the detection time with 10% DMSO was slightly longer than with 7.5%. the lower concentration of DMSO does not inhibit non-specific amplification. the higher concentration of DMSO may inhibit the activity of Bst 2.0 WarmStart. the detection limit of the optimized reaction mixture using the conventional LAMP technique was found to be 1000 fg L. monocytogenes DNA template. the detection limit of the optimized reaction mixture was found to be 1000 fg L. monocytogenes DNA template. the sensitivity of Touchdown LAMP was found to be 10 fg of L. monocytogenes DNA. the detection limit of both commercial LAMP kits is 100 fg L. monocytogenes DNA template per reaction. only one of 3 positives controls amplified using these conditions. 3/3 3/3 Listeria monocytogenes M1-004 (N/A) 3/3 2/2 3/3 3/3 Listeria monocytogenes J1-094 (1/2c) 3/3 2/2 3/3 3/3 Listeria monocytogenes C1-115 (3a) 3/3 2/2 3/3 3/3 Listeria monocytogenes J1-031 (4a) 3/3 2/2 5/7 3/3 Listeria monocytogenes W1-110 (4c) 3/3 2/2 3/3 3 in the initial experiment, Listeria invanovii ATCC49954 was falsely detected and one of three reactions amplified, while the other species had negative results. the initial false positive result may have been caused by slight aerosol pollution of DNA templates. hlyA-FIP + hlyA-LF, hlyA-FIP + hlyA-LB, hlyA-FIP + hlyA-B3 hlyA-BIP + hlyA-BIP + hlyA-B3 hlyA-BIP + hlyA-BIP + hlyA-B3 Non-specific Amplification 4/4 4/4 1/4 4/4 0/4 0/4 0/4 the detection time with 10% DMSO was slightly longer than with 7.5%. the lower concentration of DMSO does not inhibit non-specific amplification. the higher concentration of DMSO may inhibit the activity of Bst 2.0 WarmStart DNA polymerase. the detection limit of the optimized reaction mixture was found to be 1000 fg L. monocytogenes DNA template. the mixtures were heated at 57 \u00b0C for 5 min, at 61 \u00b0C for 5 min, at 59 \u00b0C. the sensitivity of Touchdown LAMP was found to be 10 fg of L. monocytogenes DNA. the detection limit of both commercial LAMP kits is 100 fg L. monocytogenes DNA template per reaction. only one of 3 positives controls amplified using these conditions. monocytogenes J1-094 (1/2c) 3/3 2/2 3/3 3/3 Listeria monocytogenes C1-115 (3a) 3/3 2/2 3/3 3/3 Listeria monocytogenes J1-031 (4a) 3/3 2/2 5/7 3/3 Listeria monocytogenes W1-110 (4c) 3/3 2/2 3/3 3/3 Listeria monocytogenes W1-110 (4c) 3/3 2/2 3/3 3/3 Listeria monocytogene the experiment with L. invanovii ATCC49954 was repeated four times and all four repeated reactions were negative. the initial false positive result may have been caused by slight aerosol pollution of DNA templates. a set of LAMP primers were designed and selected with PrimerExplorer 4 and Oligo 7 according to the reported methodology. amplification was performed in a total 25 L reaction mixture containing 1.25 mM dNTPs. different combination of LAMP primers targeting hlyA were added into different tube. the concentrations of hlyA-FIP, hlyA-BIP, hlyA-F3, hlyA-B3, hlyA-LF, and hlyA-LB were 0.8 mM, 0.8 mM, 0.4 mM, 0.4 mM, 0.1 mM and 0.1 mM respectively. DNA template was not added for determination selection of Reaction Temperature for LAMP LAMP was performed as above in a 10 L reaction mixture containing 1 pg L. monocytogenes DNA template as well as the optimized concentration DMSO at 61, 59, 57, 55 and 53 \u00b0C for 60 min. a melt curve was obtained using a StepOneTM System. listeria strains were cultured overnight at 37 \u00b0C in DifcoTM Buffered Listeria Enrichment Broth Base (Becton, Dickinson and Company, San Jose, CA, USA) listeria strains were cultured overnight at 37 \u00b0C in DifcoTM Buffered Listeria Enrichment Broth Base. a set of LAMP primers were designed and selected with PrimerExplorer 4 and Oligo 7 according to the reported methodology. different combination of LAMP primers targeting hlyA were added into different tube, as listed in Table 2. hlyA-BIP, hlyA-F3, hlyA-B3, hlyA-LF, and hlyA-LB were 0.8 mM, 0.8 mM, 0.4 mM, 0.4 mM, 0.1 mM and 0.1 mM respectively. DNA template was not added for determination of non-specific amplification. the detection limit of conventional LAMP was determined by carrying out LAMP reactions according to the conditions specified in their publication [22]. the optimized LAMP mixture was combined with serial dilutions of DNA template of Listeria monocytogenes ranging from 1 to 1000 fg. the reaction mixture was heated at selected temperature 57 \u00b0C for 60 min. listeria strains were cultured overnight at 37 \u00b0C in DifcoTM Buffered Listeria Enrichment Broth Base (Becton, Dickinson and Company, San Jose, CA, USA) and the others in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth. DNA from these pure cultures was extracted according to the manufacturer\u2019s handbook of DNeasy\u00ae Blood and Tissue Kit. the amount of DNA template used is 1 pg per reaction. DMSO may not necessarily be the best enhancing agent, but their reagents are proprietary, and DMSO served to decrease non-specific amplification in the specific experiments presented here. Touchdown LAMP, compared to conventional LAMP methods, results in increased sensitivity and yield of LAMP."}
