{"summary": "the risk of exposure to chlorine gas with large number of casualties is widespread. inhalation exposure can occur from inhalation of elemental Cl2 or inspiration of vapors that contain chlorine releasing chemicals. the respiratory system is the most adversely affected of all organ systems by chlorine gas exposure. the rest of 129 patients medical records which transferred to other two hospitals EDs were not able to reach because the reasons of cant get permission and file record insufficiency. authors classified the patients into 3 groups according to clinical and laboratory findings based on literature [1, 8, 12-14, 16] and duration of land of stay in the ED. seven (17.9%) patients were females and 32 (82.1%) were males. ages of the patients ranged between 2 and 66 years and average age was 17.03 16.01. 11 (28.2%) patients were assessed by CXR, 10 (25.6%) were assessed by ECG and 17 (43.6%) were assessed by ABG analyses. most patients did not have an ECG, ABG or CXR performed. nine (23.1%) patients were in the second group. in this group one patient received only humidified oxygen and metyl-prednisolone. one patient received inhaler salbutamol, 2 patients received ranitidine and one patient received metoclopramide plus ranitidine and inhaler salbutamol combination. chemical end-products cause damage to cellular proteins, resulting in tissue injury. transportation mishaps can release large quantities of Cl2 gas into the air. most unintentional exposures occur in the industrial field. in the presented series, there were only six smokers and one asthmatic child. in the presented series, there were only six smokers and one asthmatic child. authors do not know how much chlorine gas was released into the atmosphere when the chlorine tank exploded. rhino rhea, conjunctiva irritation, oropharyngeal pruritus and irritation, cough, sore throat, laryngeal edema, dyspnea, and sometimes hoarseness and stridor, headache, chest pain, and anxiety. in our series most prevalent symptoms were cough (alone) and cough together with dyspnea. radiographs can show diffuse nodular opacities, patchy consolidation, pulmonary edema, and signs of vascular congestion. radiographic abnormalities may appear late as lung injury develops and progresses. the role of computerized tomography in evaluating lung injury is not established. in 282 cases reported by Agabiti et al [15], intravenous cortisone and humidified O2 were used in some cases. no patient received nebulized sodium bicarbonate treatment immediately following high-rate chlorine exposure. nebulized sodium bicarbonate has also been suggested as a therapy for chlorine exposure. corticosteroid treatment efficacy has been given in casualties because of accidental exposure to chlorine, phosgene, or mustard. the criteria for administration of treatment are not clear and therefore the efficacy of treatment can not be ascertained. there is no scientific evidence for empiric use of antibiotics. study limitations This study revealed the first most crowded accidental chlorine gas exposure in Turkey. therefore authors could not find enough similar national study to compare. the patients were classified into three groups, but couldn\u2019t compare in term of determine the significant differences such variables as exposure rate and age groups. all patient treatments were not designed based on the literature, they were accepted completely arbitrary and authors could not classify the patients according to received treatments. authors were not able to reach the patients medical data, who presented to other hospitals. authors recommend that non symptomatic or slightly exposed patients do not need any treatment or may be treated symptomatically."}
