{"summary": "Filoviruses are single-stranded, negative-sense RNA viruses that exhibit a unique heterogeneous filamentous structure. both EBOV and MARV infect a wide variety of mammals. this wide tropism has complicated the identification of cellular proteins required for viral entry. GP1 contains receptor binding domain (RBD) and is responsible for interacting with one or more cellular receptors. GP2 contains a fusion loop, heptad repeat regions, the transmembrane domain and a short cytoplasmic tail. cleaved subunits are linked by a disulfide bond to generate a GP1,2 heterodimer. GP1 Mature GP1 is composed of three distinct domains: the RBD, the glycan cap and a heavily O-linked mucin-like domain. EBOV and MARV GP pseudovirions compete with each other for filoviral GP1,2-dependent entry into permissive cells. filovirus GP1 contains a mucin-like domain at the carboxy terminus. this region is heavily glycosylated with both N- and O- linked glycans. mucin domain may shield GP RBS residues from immune recognition on free virus. GP1 are highlighted in royal blue, the head domain is shown in teal with the beta-strands and adjacent loop region containing the RBS highlighted in red. GP2 is composed of a fusion loop found near the amino terminus followed by a N-terminal heptad repeat region, a C-terminal heptad repeat region, a transmembrane region and a short cytoplasmic tail. mutagenesis studies of EBOV or MARV GP2 suggest a similar chain of events to those previously reported for other class I viral glycoproteins leads to viral/cell membrane fusion. this is due to the broad tropism of filoviruses for a variety of different cell types as well as the ability of these viruses to infect cells from a wide range of species. glycan cap of GP1 interact with C-type lectins. a similar adherence function for C-type lectins has been identified for other enveloped viruses such as HIV. anti-Axl antibodies blocked EBOV transduction of some cells, whereas these antibodies had no effect on transduction of other cells. a screen performed in our laboratory also identified Axl as being important in EBOV GP-dependent entry [60]. OV GP interacted, and removal of the glycan cap enhanced the specificity of GP interaction with TIM-1-expressing cells. studies have shown that both the mucin domain and the glycan cap of GP1 interact with C-type lectins [47,49] studies implicate 1 integrin in stimulation of endosomal protease events that are required for productive EBOV transduction. TIM-1 Our lab performed a comparative genomic analysis (CGA) screen. a screen showed a positive correlation between EBOV transduction and expression of a series of cellular proteins that were previously appreciated to enhance EBOV transduction (C-type lectins, integrins and Axl) expression of TIM-1 in poorly permissive cells enhanced EBOV entry and loss of surface-expressed TIM-1 in highly permissive cells abrogated filovirus infection/transduction. several groups have implicated clathrin-dependent entry mechanisms in filovirus entry. other groups have identified macropinocytosis as a main and perhaps sole mechanism of filovirus entry. a number of these uptake studies used EBOV GP pseudotyped lentiviruses or vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) as the cargo. no evidence exists that EBOV GP1 undergoes conformational changes upon binding to a cell surface receptor. no evidence exists that EBOV GP1 undergoes conformational changes upon binding to a cell surface receptor. the early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1) colocalizes with EBOV virus particles. a small EBOV GP1,2 trimer serves as the fusion-ready form of the glycoprotein. it is believed that this processed, fusion-ready form is then triggered by additional events to a conformationally stable state, resulting in fusion. the size and composition of this smaller form is not known. trimmed GP1 that is believed to generate a GP1 that is similar to the Cathepsin L and B-cleaved form can be triggered to bind to liposomes at elevated temperatures under low pH and mildly reducing conditions. studies have shown that at least under these conditions this GP conformation is a fusion-ready form of the filovirus glycoprotein. cells lacking a functional NPC1 exhibit an abnormally high accumulation of cholesterol in the lysosomes of their cells. the expression of NPC1 and not its cholesterol transport activity were critical for EBOV entry. EBOV GP-mediated attachment and entry into early endosomes was unaffected in NPC1-defective cells. however, electron micrographs of NPC1 null cells infected with EBOV GP pseudotyped virus show the accumulation of perinuclear vesicles laden with EBOV GP pseudovirions that were positive for the lysosomal marker LAMP1. the GP1 portion of EBOV GP1,2 allows delivery of the filovirion to an endosome where conditions become progressively more favorable for generating the fusion-ready form of GP1,2. a core hydrophobic sequence of 16 amino acids within this loop is thought to insert into host endosomal membranes. the fusion loop is restrained by GP1 residues from a neighboring subunit, preventing premature fusion events. the insertion of GP2 into host membranes causes an extension of the GP2 trimers into an energetically unfavorable state. this also causes the two heptad repeat regions (HRs) within GP2 to be fully exposed to the physiological conditions within the acidified host endosome, which may aid in further triggering of GP2 to promote final collapse of the two HRs. elucidation of these entry events provides clear targets for the development of drugs that may prevent both filovirus infection and disease. elucidation of these entry events provides clear targets for the development of drugs that may prevent both filovirus infection and disease. ally unfavorable insertion of EBOV GP2 fusion loop into host endosomal membranes (i) is followed by the energetically favorable collapse of EBOV GP into a six-helix bundle (ii) allowing for lipid mixing and hemifusion of host and viral membrane lipids (ii)"}
