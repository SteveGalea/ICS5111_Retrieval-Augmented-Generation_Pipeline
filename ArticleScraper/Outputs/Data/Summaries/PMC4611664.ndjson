{"summary": "similar patterns persisted when disease classes were analyzed separately. but the strength and consistency of these patterns varied. variation was linked to differences in the mean number of countries that diseases occurred in. country-specific zoonotic disease co-zones for Thailand and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) show how beta diversity can be visualized with respect to any focal region. additive co-zones for Ebola spillover-positive countries calculated across four time points became relatively stable from 1994 onward. this stability extended to the 2014 west africa outbreak, which cannot be considered inconsistent with historical co-occurrence patterns for zoonotic diseases in this region. co-occurrence index is qualitatively able to shortlist regions at elevated risk of Ebola outbreaks based on existing co-occurrence patterns of zoonotic diseases among countries. additive co-zone models depict the average pairwise similarity (1 sor; warmer colors indicate more similar) of zoonotic disease assemblages between countries recording primary Ebola cases. population size 0.007 0.001*** Latitude 0.001 0.208 Model: R2 = 0.54. most of this explanatory power came from the similarity of mammal assemblages among countries. most of this explanatory power came from the similarity of mammal assemblages among countries. model outputs are shown in Table 2 and SI Appendix, Table S1. separate disease classes are shown in SI Appendix, Fig. S5. more consistent effects of other explanatory variables were also identified. global human infectious disease pathogeographic patterns. nestedness (nes) was more pronounced for the more widespread disease classes. separate disease classes and key to colors are presented in SI Appendix, Fig. S1. our co-occurrence index is qualitatively able to shortlist regions at elevated risk of Ebola outbreaks based on existing co-occurrence patterns of zoonotic diseases among Ebola spillover-producing countries. compared favorably (63.6% overlap) with the 22 at-risk countries identified by Pigott et al. (25) extrinsic factors, without exception, were together more explanatory than geographic distance. most of this explanatory power came from the similarity of mammal assemblages among countries, which was significantly and positively correlated with the similarity of disease assemblages among countries. mammalian biodiversity was not the most explanatory variable was bacterial diseases (SI Appendix, Fig. S5) this result helps explain a striking similarity between pathogeographic and zoogeographic regions of the world. biogeography provides a fundamental context in which all other factors that mediate disease emergence and spread are set. the \u201cpathogeographic\u201d (28) patterns revealed here correlate with patterns of mammalian biodiversity. they are broadly consistent with classic zoogeographic classifications. biogeography thus provides a fundamental context in which all other factors contributing to the emergence and spread of infectious diseases are set. case study in identifying countries at elevated risk of Ebola outbreaks strongly suggests pathogeographic patterns could be exploited more broadly and at an early stage. examples include focusing surveillance for diseases, pathogens, or host and vector species; strengthening and targeting biosecurity capacities; responding to outbreaks; or optimizing pathogen discovery efforts (4\u20138) these groups appear to be driven predominantly by turnover (the replacement of diseases from one country to another) the greater heterogeneity among these groups is likely driving the overall pattern for all diseases and illustrates that human infectious disease assemblages continue to be fundamentally constrained by biogeographic processes. similarity in population size and similarity in land area were both correlated with similarity in infectious disease assemblages overall and for all disease classes when analyzed separately. globalization is becoming an increasingly important factor for a range of disease risks (13, 35) despite limited explanatory power overall, similarity in per capita health expenditure was correlated with similarity in disease assemblages among countries for vector-borne, zoonotic, bacterial, and parasitic diseases. this result is consistent with previous studies showing a clear effect of health investment in limiting disease distributions and burdens. quality of infectious disease data prevent comprehensive mapping for all but a few human infectious diseases (1). disease detection and coordinated reporting is a significant challenge, but it is sobering to consider that we know more about the global distributions of the world\u2019s 5,000 critically endangered plant and animal species. many of these species are exceedingly rare, cryptic, and illusive. biogeographic patterns are consistent with classic zoogeographic classifications. biogeography provides a fundamental context in which all other factors contributing to the emergence and spread of infectious diseases are set. biogeographic patterns routinely underpin efforts to discover, monitor, and manage global biodiversity. pathogeographic patterns could be exploited more broadly and at an early stage for a range of activities typically undertaken in data- or resource-poor settings. examples include focusing surveillance for diseases, pathogens, or host and vector species; strengthening and targeting biosecurity capacities; responding to outbreaks; or optimizing pathogen discovery efforts (4\u20138) differences in disease assemblages in these groups appear to be driven predominantly by turnover (the replacement of diseases from one country to another) in many cases, are likely primarily due to the geographic restrictedness of the reservoir, intermediate, or vector species on which they depend to complete transmission cycles. the greater heterogeneity among these groups is likely driving the overall pattern for all diseases. similarity in population size and similarity in land area were correlated with similarity in infectious disease assemblages overall. human flight traffic between countries was correlated with greater similarity of disease assemblages overall and for human-specific, vector-borne, and bacterial diseases. growth in human connectivity seems certain to play an increasingly important role in shaping human infectious disease assemblages in the future. despite limited explanatory power overall, similarity in per capita health expenditure was correlated with similarity in disease assemblages among countries for vector-borne, zoonotic, bacterial, and parasitic diseases. this result is consistent with previous studies showing a clear effect of health investment in limiting disease distributions and burdens. a recent systematic review concluded that serious deficiencies in the current availability and quality of infectious disease data prevent comprehensive mapping for all but a few human infectious diseases (1). we know more about the global distributions of the world\u2019s 5,000 critically endangered plant and animal species than we do about the 1,400 or so infectious agents causing disease in humans. we compiled a presence/absence matrix of human infectious diseases at the country level from data held in the Global Infectious Disease and Epidemiology Network database. to our knowledge, GIDEON is the most comprehensive infectious disease occurrence database currently available at a global scale. to our knowledge, GIDEON is the most comprehensive infectious disease occurrence database currently available at a global scale. we used the epidemiological trait data to group further analyses into seven disease \u201cclasses\u201d of interest, which are not mutually exclusive: human-specific, zoonotic, vector-borne, non\u2013vector-borne, bacterial, viral, and parasitic diseases. we did not analyze three disease classes due to low sample sizes. all dissimilarity metrics were calculated using the \u201cbeta.pair\u201d function in the R package betapart. in some cases, we report assemblage similarity rather than dissimilarity, defined as 1 sor. we first plotted the similarity of disease assemblages for all countries relative to a single focal country. this approach is equivalent to visualizing beta diversity with respect to a reference point (16) we hypothesized that a novel pathogen or disease that is detected in the focal country is also more likely to occur within that country\u2019s additive co-zone. MRDM is an extension of partial Mantel analysis often used for the analysis of spatial ecological data. the framework is well suited to quantifying and controlling for spatial autocorrelation at varying spatial scales with the use of distance lag matrices. only significant lag categories were added to MRDM models. we compiled a presence/absence matrix of human infectious diseases at the country level from data held in the Global Infectious Disease and Epidemiology Network database. human-specific diseases are diseases currently restricted to human reservoir hosts. zoonotic diseases are diseases for which development and reproduction are restricted to nonhuman hosts. multihost diseases are diseases that can use both animal and human hosts to complete the life cycle. c 2a + b + c is the number of diseases common to both countries. b and c are the number of diseases that are unique to each of the two countries being compared. differences in disease assemblages between two countries (sor) could occur in two distinct ways, each with potentially different underlying mechanisms. each country was assigned an additive color representing its relative position in relation to other countries in 3D NMDS space. we also used clustering (unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean) to assess the qualitative fit between zoogeographic and pathogeographic patterns. existing patterns of infectious disease co-occurrence could be used as a source of prior information to place baseline relative likelihoods of the occurrence of a pathogen. the characteristics of Ebola virus outbreaks were used to rank countries at risk of recording Ebola cases in the future. we used MRDM (26, 40) to analyze the correlates of global patterns of disease assemblage dissimilarity. MRDM is an extension of partial Mantel analysis often used for the analysis of spatial ecological data. method of deriving explanatory variables for use in models is detailed in SI Appendix, S4. To examine the relevance of these explanatory variables while controlling for the effects of spatial autocorrelation, we used MRDM incorporating distance lag matrices as described by Lichstein (26). sor, a widely used index, encompasses the proportion of shared diseases between two countries. it is defined as: sor = b + c 2 a + b + c, where a is the number of diseases common to both countries, and b and c are the number of diseases that are unique to each of the two countries being compared. we used ordination (nonmetric multidimensional scaling; NMDS) on the dissimilarity matrices. each country was assigned an additive color representing its relative position in relation to other countries in 3D NMDS space. countries assigned more similar colors share more similar disease assemblages. we first created co-zone layers for Thailand and the DRC as arbitrary example cases. we created an additive co-zone layer reflecting the regional similarity of disease assemblages with respect to a group of focal countries. this approach may be suited to situations where a novel pathogen or disease is detected across multiple countries. MRDM incorporated distance lag matrices as described by lichstein. we then analyzed disease similarity by geographic distance (square root-transformed) with mantel correlograms. only significant lag categories were added to MRDM models. supplementary material Supplementary File pnas.1507442112.sapp.pdf (3.3MB, pdf)."}
