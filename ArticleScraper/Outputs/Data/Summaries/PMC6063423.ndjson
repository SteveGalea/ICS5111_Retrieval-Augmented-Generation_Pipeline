{"summary": "isolated influenza viruses were characterized antigenically by haemagglutination inhibition assay and genetically by sequencing of HA and NA genes. in 2014\u20132015 the median week of influenza detection was week 7/2015 with B/Yamagata lineage viruses dominating. influenza virus activity occurred mainly from December through March in all seasons. one third of ILI/SARI cases were associated with influenza caused by antigenically and genetically distinct influenza viruses over the course of the three seasons. the first pandemic of the 21st century caused by influenza virus A/H1N1pdm09 demonstrated the importance of influenza surveillance worldwide. ILI surveillance was carried out in one outpatient clinic with a predetermined catchment of approximately 60,000 residents in the capital city Tbilisi. the children\u2019s central hospital, the largest children\u2019s clinic of the country also in Tbilisi, and four hospitals in Kutaisi (the biggest city in Western Georgia) were selected as SARI surveillance sites. questionnaires were completed prior to sampling and more detailed questionnaires were completed for fatal SARI cases. questionnaires included demographics, clinical signs, vaccination and antiviral treatment status. specimens were screened for influenza viruses using molecular kits. cDNAs were subjected to BigDye\u00ae terminator sequencing amplifications (Applied Biosystems) and the purified BigDye\u00ae terminator products were sequenced using an ABI 3130XL Analyser. genome sequencing data were processed and assembled using Sequencher 5.0 software. signal peptide component being removed from HA genes and stop codons removed from all genes. trees were visualized using FigTree (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/) s clinic of the country also in Tbilisi and four hospitals in Kutaisi were selected as SARI surveillance sites. medical staff and epidemiologists at each site were trained on case definitions, specimen collection, storage and transportation. case definitions were standardized for all clinics involved in influenza sentinel surveillance using the 2014 revision of WHO case definitions [5] real-time RT-PCR was performed for influenza virus detection, influenza A subtyping and influenza B lineage determination. laboratory results were recorded as influenza negative or positive for seasonal influenza viruses (A/H1N1pdm09, A/H3N2, B, B/Victoria or B/Yamagata). Virus isolation and antigenic characterization was carried out by haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay. amplifications (Applied Biosystems) and the purified BigDye\u00ae terminator products were sequenced using an ABI 3130XL Analyser. gene sequences of viruses from Georgia generated by Crick Worldwide Influenza Centre and CDC were downloaded from the EpiFlu database of the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data. maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were estimated using RaxML v8.2X with a GTRGAMMA substitution model. influenza virus detection Viral RNA was extracted with QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kits (Qiagen, Germany) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. real-time RT-PCR was performed for influenza virus detection, influenza A subtyping and influenza B lineage determination. Specimens were screened for influenza viruses using molecular kits, positive controls and protocols provided by the US CDC. pdm09 specific primers and the Sanger sequencing protocol were provided to NIC Georgia by Walter Reed Army Research Institute (WRAIR), USA. cDNAs were subjected to BigDye\u00ae terminator sequencing amplifications (Applied Biosystems) and the purified BigDye\u00ae terminator products were then sequenced using an ABI 3130XL Analyser. a total of 12,912 ILI and 10,218 SARI patients met the ILI/SARI case definitions at sentinel sites during three consecutive influenza seasons 2014\u20132017. of these, 1,248 (9.7%) ILI and 1,997 (19.5%) SARI patients were sampled and tested for influenza. in 2015\u20132016 the median week of total influenza detections was week 5/2016 (IQR weeks 3\u20137) with influenza B viruses dominating (83%); the 2016\u20132017 season showed a bimodal distribution of influenza detections. the first wave was caused by A/H3N2 (55%) with a median week of 51/2016 (IQR weeks 50\u201352) and the second by influenza B (45%) with a median week of detections of 9/2017 (IQR weeks 7\u201311) ILI referral exceeded the threshold from week 40/2014 until week 14/2015. in 2015\u20132016 ILI visits exceeded the threshold for only weeks 43-51/2016. overall influenza detection was highest 48% (133/276) among children aged 5\u201314 years. the highest A/H1N1pdm09 virus detection rate was among the 30\u201364 year-olds (2015\u20132016 season, 32%, OR = 1.76, CI 1.13\u20132.75, p = 0.012) the highest A/H1N1pdm09 virus detection rate was among the 30\u201364 year-olds (2015\u20132016 season, 32%, OR = 1.76, CI 1.13\u20132.75, p = 0.012) SARI admissions rose above an approximate 10% threshold in 2014\u20132015. in 2015\u20132016 and 2016\u20132017 seasons these rates were higher. the blue line represents percentages of influenza-positive cases. a/H3N2 virus detection was mostly seen in cases aged 30\u201364 years (season 2016\u20132017, 35%, OR = 2.39, CI 1.36\u20134.20, p = 0.002) severe cases associated with A/H1N1pdm09 viruses in 2015\u20132016 were most frequently observed in patients aged 30\u201364 years (59%, OR = 5.04, CI 3.12\u20138.16, pP0.001) and 15\u201329 years (49%, OR = 2.99, CI 1. 18 (67%) of 27 fatal cases were in the 30\u201364 years age group. the leading comorbidities were cardiovascular (12/27; 44%) and neurological disorders (7/27; 26%) of 27 lethal cases had at least one underlying condition. the median time between symptom-onset and hospitalization was 4 days. no substitutions were observed in either the HA or NA of A/Georgia/791/2016. HA gene phylogeny of influenza A/H1N1pdm09 viruses detected in Georgia during 2014\u20132015 and 2015\u20132016 seasons. HA genes of nine viruses circulating early in the 2015\u20132016 season belonged to group 6B and encoded two additional amino acid substitutions K311T in HA1 and L37Q in HA2. the NA sequences of these viruses also fell into genetic subgroup 6B.1 characterized by encoding the substitutions S84N, S162N and I216T in HA1. antiserum raised against the 2015\u20132016 season vaccine virus, egg-propagated A/Stockholm/6/2014 (3C.3a), recognized all three viruses poorly, but they were recognized by antiserum raised against the 2016\u20132017 season vaccine virus, egg-propagated A/Hong Kong/4801/2014, at titers only 4-fold lower than the homologous titer of the antiserum. the HA gene of the other three viruses clustered in subgroup 3C.2a. the HA gene of the other three viruses clustered in subgroup 3C.2a. all 18 sequenced viruses of the 2016\u20132017 season from Georgia belonged to subclade 3C.2a1. two viruses showed mixed sequences encoding the glycosylation motif at residues 158\u2013160 in HA1 following culture. the HA genes of viruses from Georgia clustered in two subgroups. influenza B B/Yamagata lineage Eleven (92%) of 12 viruses of 2014\u20132015 season were successfully recovered. all but two viruses showed reduced recognition by antiserum raised against the egg-propagated clade 2 used in the 2014\u20132015 season. all viruses were recognized very well by antiserum raised against egg-propagated viruses from clade 3. two viruses reacted well with post-infection ferret antiserum raised against egg-propagated B/Brisbane/60/2008. the other five were recognized poorly by the same antiserum. the other five were recognized poorly by the same antiserum. 1,248 ILI and 1,997 (19.5%) SARI patients were sampled and tested for influenza. overall 30% (978/3,245) specimens were positive: 397 (32%) ILI and 581 (29%) SARI. influenza detection median weeks and prevailing viruses varied between seasons. ILI samples over three seasons (2014\u20132017) 132 (33%) were A/H1N1pdm09, 121 (30%) were A/H3N2 and 147 (37%), influenza B (three were positive for both influenza A and B viruses) weekly outpatient visits for ILI rose in parallel with laboratory-confirmed influenza virus detection. children aged 5\u201314 years were the group most affected by influenza B viruses (2014\u20132015 season\u201440%, OR = 2.95, CI 1.75\u20134.96, p0.001; 2016\u20132017 season\u201427%, OR = 4.10, CI 2.17\u20137.73, p0.001) followed by the age group 15\u201329 years (2016\u20132017 season, 24%, OR = 2.45, CI 1.20\u20135.03, p = 0.012) highest A/H1N1pd total numbers of ILI and SARI specimens tested for influenza viruses shown. % positivity shown in parentheses. 18 of 1248 swabbed ILI participants had been vaccinated. influenza B related hospitalizations was highest in age groups 15\u201329 years (2014\u20132015 season, 30%, OR = 3.19, CI 1.34\u20137.59, p = 0.013; 2016\u20132017 season, 46%, OR = 3.98, CI 2.26\u20137.01, p0.001) and 5\u201314 years (2016\u20132017 season, 33%, OR = 2.39, CI 1.36\u20134.20, p = 0.002) despite the dominance of influenza B viruses in 2014\u20132015, there were still seven deaths associated with A/H1N1pdm09 that season. the age of patients who died ranged from 1 to 84 years. 18 (67%) of 27 fatal cases were in the 30\u201364 years age group, yielding a high odds of fatal outcome. characterization of influenza viruses A/H1N1pdm09 Eighteen (86%) of 21 viruses were successfully recovered by WHO CC London and studied by HI assay. all but two viruses were well recognized in HI assays, within 2-fold of the homologous titer. both were recognized at titers 4- and 16-fold lower respectively. the NA of these four viruses differed from A/California/7/2009. HA genes of nine viruses circulating early in the 2015\u20132016 season belonged to group 6B. encoding the substitutions S84N, S162N (introducing a new potential glycosylation site) and I216T in HA1 and clustered with reference virus A/Slovenia/2903/2015. antisera raised against the 2014\u20132015 season vaccine virus, egg-propagated A/Texas/50/2012 (3C.1), and antisera raised against both cell culture-propagated and egg-propagated cultivars of the 2015\u20132016 season. five of ten viruses from the 2015\u20132016 season were recovered, based on detection of sialidase activity, but only three had HA activity. analysis of HA and NA genes of four viruses from the 2014\u20132015 season revealed that one belonged to genetic subgroup 3C.3b, encoding HA amino acid substitutions compared to the 3C.3b group. the HA gene of the other three viruses clustered in subgroup 3C.2a, characterized by amino acid substitutions. HA gene sequence analysis of 2015\u20132016 season viruses showed that four of the five fell in subclade 3C.2a1 and one in clade 3C.3a, the A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 clade. the HA gene of the 3C.3a virus encoded HA1 amino acid substitution Y94H, commonly seen in 3C.3a viruses collected during the 2015\u20132016 season. encoding an HA1 R142G substitution (12 viruses) and the second with HA1 amino acid changes K92R, N121K and H311Q (6 viruses) all viruses differed from that of the 2014\u20132015 season vaccine virus, B/Massachusetts/2/2012. HA and NA genes of 7 viruses formed a tight cluster. the NAs were defined by Q42R amino acid substitution. two viruses reacted well with post-infection ferret antiserum raised against egg-propagated B/Brisbane/60/2008. nine of 11 viruses from the 2016\u20132017 season carried additional substitutions of I45M, T72A, P336S in the NA. all but two viruses were well recognized in HI assays, within 2-fold of the homologous titer. dm09 viruses belonged to the 6B genetic group characterized by encoding the amino acid substitutions P83S, D97N, K163Q, S185T, S203T, A256T, K283E and I321V in HA1 and E47K, S124N and E172K in HA2 compared to A/California/7/2009. the NA of these four viruses differed from A/California/7 of 28 A/H3N2 viruses from the three seasons 22 (79%) were recovered by the WHO CCs. it was poorly recognized by antisera raised against the 2014\u20132015 season vaccine virus, egg-propagated A/Texas/50/2012 (3C.1) and antisera raised against both cell culture-propagated and egg-propagated cultivars of the 2015\u20132016 season. analysis of HA and NA genes of four viruses from the 2014\u20132015 season revealed that one belonged to genetic subgroup 3C.3b. one virus belonged to genetic subgroup 3C.3b, encoding HA amino acid substitutions compared to the 3C.3 group.
