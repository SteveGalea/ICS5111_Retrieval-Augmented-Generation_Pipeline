{"summary": "the family Arteriviridae belongs to the order Nidovirales. it includes the largest currently known RNA genome viruses. this includes equine arteritis virus (EAV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV) arterivirus nsp11 has nidovirus-specific endoribonuclease activity, cleaving both single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) at a 3\u2032 uridylate-specific site (11) the catalytic residues likely are two histidines and a lysine in the C terminus, similar to that of RNase A. research on PRRSV nsp11 is focused on its effect on the host cell immune processes. nsp11 is associated with five different pathways: histone-related, mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, cell cycle and DNA replication, complement, and the ubiquitin-proteasome pathways. wild-type (WT) PRRSV and EAV nsp11 from bacteria, but their solubilities were extremely low (0.1 mg/liter), perhaps due to the high toxicity of arterivirus WT nsp11. BLAST searches of the solved structures revealed that the shared identities with known sequences were very low, with the highest value being only 22%. data collection and refinement statistics of

and His129 are located in a groove formed between -sheet H and a four-stranded -sheet (A, B, D, and C) the modeled uridine 3\u2032-phosphate (UMP) molecule is shown in a ball-and-stick representation. the final model of the mutant solved at 3.1 contains six protein molecules. the NTD is formed by a three-stranded antiparallel -sheet (1-5-6) and a four-stranded antiparallel -sheet (2-3-7-4) the CTD contains an antiparallel three-stranded -sheet (F-H) and two two-stranded antiparallel -sheets (A-B and C-E) RMSD of 1.4 and the differences mostly occur at loops and the long linker between the NTD and CTD. the overall folds between the -sheets of the arterivirus nsp11 mutants and SARS-CoV nsp15 appear to be similar, but the arrangement, length, and positions of the loops and loops differ greatly. catalytic residues of arterivirus nsp11 mutants show similar spatial arrangements. a positively charged groove was found in the vicinity of the key catalytic residues. the electrostatic potential is largely negative in the other positions of the CTD. conformations in the CTD of EAV nsp11 K170A mutant protomers differ remarkably. major differences occur in the putative active center. the RMSD between these two nsp11 protomers was 1.8. the structural comparison between all arterivirus nsp11 protomers shows that the NTD and the noncatalytic region of CTD are nearly identical. however, the conformations of the catalytic regions are quite diverse. several hydrogen bonds and water-mediated hydrogen bonds are present in both interfaces. the catalytic region of protomer A is directly involved in the interaction of both interfaces. the observation can explain why only protomer A has a complete electron density in the active center. for protomer B, the CTD is stabilized by only one protomer. both trimers and tetramers fit best for the WT PRRSV nsp11. the results were similar for the PRRSV nsp11 K173A mutant. oligomerization of PRRSV nsp11 is diverse and concentration dependent. the interfaces formed by the two CTDs are nearly identical in three dimers, with interface areas ranging between 700 2 and 750 2. residues in the interfaces are different from those observed in the PRRSV nsp11 K173A mutant. two types of interfaces are nearly identical to the observed CTD-NTD interfaces in the PRRSV nsp11 K173A and EAV nsp11 K170A mutants. these results imply that several interactions between protomers are conserved. gel filtration, sedimentation velocity (SV) and SAXS analyses of these mutants suggest they exist as different types of oligomers in solution. the results reveal that the oligomerization may be dependent on the concentration. the other SAXS parameters observed at different concentrations of EAV nsp11 K170A or H141A were consistent with the above-described results. thus, the oligomerization of EAV nsp11 mutants is also concentration dependent. method to determine the coordinates of heavy atoms in the PRRSV nsp11 K173A mutant crystal. the

arterivirus nsp11 mutants adopt a compact fold. it contains four protein molecules (residues 1 to 219, with two of the protomers missing residues 140 to 141 or 138 to 139) consists of two domains, the NTD (residues 1 to 88) and the CTD (residues 104 to 219). core conformations of the CTD and NTD are nearly identical, with an overall root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 1.0. previous mutational studies confirmed that the putative active sites are essential for nsp11 endonuclease activity (11) the sequence alignment of arterivirus nsp11 and coronavirus nsp15 revealed that the catalytic center is conserved. a positively charged groove was found in the vicinity of the key catalytic residues. two different types of conformations in the CTD of the PRRSV nsp11 K173A mutant protomers were found to differ remarkably. the RMSD between these two nsp11 protomers was 1.8, and the major structural variation was in the catalytic region of the CTD. the catalytic regions have three types of conformations in the asymmetric unit. one major conformation is the same as that of the EAV nsp11 K170A mutant, as well as that of PRRSV nsp11. the interacting residues are Y69, S74, and F76 in the NTD of the symmetric protomer B and R153, G164, S166, and K173 in the CTD of protomer A. the interacting residues are Y69, S74, and F76 in the NTD of the symmetric protomer B and R153, G164, S166, and K173 in the CTD of protomer A. to further uncover the oligomeric states of PRRSV nsp11 in solution, we performed gel filtration and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analyses. the broad peak of the PRRSV K173A mutant suggests that it exists as different types of oligomers in solution. the theoretical scattering curves of tetramers, trimers, dimers, and monomers are shown. for the EAV nsp11 K170A mutant structure, one asymmetric unit contains six protein molecules that belong to three dimers. these three dimers are nearly identical. similar interfaces were found in aligned EAV nsp11 K170A and H141A mutant structures (D); for example, the interface in panel G is similar to that in panel C. the major interface between each protomer involves one CTD and one NTD, with the interface areas ranging between 600 2 and 700 2. both trimer and tetramer models of EAV nsp11 H141A fit best among the six fitted SAXS profiles at 1 mg/ml. however, at the 4.5-mg/ml protein concentration, the theoretically calculated SAXS profile from any monomer, dimer, or trimer did not agree well with the experimental data. the results reveal that the oligomerization may be dependent on the concentration. the catalytic region of arterivirus nsp11 showed an obvious conformational flexibility (Fig. 2 and 3), greatly different from those in other nidoviruses. the catalytic region is especially flexible and adopts different conformations in the different subunits. nsp11 unable to discriminate between cytidylates and uridylates. no counterpart corresponding to the NTD of arterivirus nsp15 exists in arterivirus nsp 11. in this study, we expressed the WT arterivirus nsp11 and mutants bacterially. functional studies such as gel filtration, analytical ultracentrifugation, and SAXS experiments with these proteins suggested that these proteins exist as several types of oligomers in solution. therefore, the oligomeric states observed in the structures are consistent with the observations in solution. the structure of the arterivirus nsp11 family of proteins allows us to propose a mechanism for the enzymatic activity. nsp11 genes were cloned into a modified pET-28a vector in which the thrombin recognition site was replaced by a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease recognition site. the cultures were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. the lysate was centrifuged at 47,000 g for 30 min to remove cell debris. the soluble fraction was applied to a Ni2+-chelating column. crystal screening was performed at 18\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C using the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method. small crystals appeared in several solutions containing PEG, but they were fragile. the conditions were optimized, and high-quality crystals were finally obtained in 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 15% PEG 3350, and 0.1 M (NH4)2SO4. the structure of the PRRSV nsp11 K173A protein was determined by the single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) method. a final solution of six Hg2+ ions was found by the program SHELEX C (28) at 2.6. small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data were collected at the beamline BL19U2 of the SSRF using our previously published methods. all proteins were subjected to size exclusion chromatography with a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl and 500 mM NaCl. nsp11 mutants were cleaved using his-TEV protease at 4\u00b0C for 8 h. all final clones were verified by DNA sequencing. crystals for the PRRSV nsp11 K173A mutant were finally obtained in 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 15% PEG 3350, and 0.1 M (NH4)2SO4. the crystals for the EAV nsp11 K170A fragment were finally obtained in 0.1 M sodium citrate (pH 6.6) and 1 M (NH4)3PO4. 11 K173A and EAV nsp11 K170A and H141A mutants were collected on beamlines BL18U and BL17U. data were indexed, integrated, and scaled using HKL2000 (27) the structure was refined to 2.16 with an Rwork of 18.4% and an Rfree of 21.0%. all structural figures were prepared by using the PyMOL program
