{"summary": "professor Yoshinori Ohsumi and colleagues published the first of several landmark papers demonstrating molecular control of macroautophagy in response to nutrient starvation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. thereafter, several groups identified autophagy-related proteins (ATGs) that control fundamental aspects of the macroautophagy pathway, including the formation of autophagosomes. autophagy is the most well studied and genetically controlled by ATGs. it proceeds through multiple \u201ccanonical\u201d steps that include (1) initiation by an autophagy-inducing signal, (2) nucleation of an isolation membrane or phagophore assembly site. initiation, nucleation, and elongation require the hierarchical recruitment and activity of 15 ATGs and other proteins to the phagophore assembly site to construct the autophagosome. secretory autophagy mediate the unconventional secretion of multiple proteins (e.g., Acb1 in yeast, and IL-1, IL-18, and HMGB1 in mammalian cells) that lack an N-terminal signal sequence. targets of secretory autophagy, such as IL-1, are translocated into the intramembrane space of an LC3+ double membrane vesicular intermediate. autophagy-related processes are fundamentally distinct from classic autophagy. the list includes secretion and exocytosis, LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP), viral replication and exit, antigen presentation, and ATG-mediated regulation of inflammatory and immune signaling. some classically secreted proteins appear to be preferentially rerouted through unconventional pathways to facilitate trafficking during stress. studies to date have uncovered clear genetic requirements for two proteins originally implicated in the stacking of the ER and Golgi apparatus. mechanistic underpinnings of secretory autophagy are only beginning to emerge, and numerous questions remain unaddressed. despite the genetic interconnections between ATGs and Grh1, recent work questions whether autophagy and Grh1 truly converge on a common secretory pathway. secretory autophagy involves autophagosome-like vesicles that bypass STX17-dependent fusion with lysosomes. they use the SNARE protein SEC22B in combination with plasma membrane syntaxins to complete cargo secretion. further dissecting the cellular mechanisms through which autophagy mediators facilitate these diverse secretory processes remains an important topic for future study. LC3-II facilitates phagosome maturation in LAP, probably by recruiting molecules that enhances fusion to the endolysosomal compartment. LC3-II facilitates phagosome maturation in LAP, probably by recruiting molecules that enhances fusion to the endolysosomal compartment. lipidation occurs on early double membrane structures, called phagophores. LAP uses a unique VPS34 complex, composed of Beclin-1, UVRAG, and Rubicon (RUBCN), a protein that is inhibitory to classic autophagy. last, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by NADPH oxidase\u20132 (NOX2) has also been critically implicated in the control of LAP. studies have uncovered a growing list of nonautophagic functions mediated by ATGs that modulate the infection of host cells and tissues. in this section, we focus on how individual ATGs can either augment or diminish the propagation of assorted viruses as well as how ATGs restrict intracellular pathogens via pathways that are distinct from classic autophagy. Epstein-Barr virus and varicella-zoster virus acquire LC3-conjugated membranes. inhibiting LC3 lipidation via ATG12 or ATG16L1 knockdown impairs viral exit and results in the accumulation of viral DNA in the cytosol. the viral product matrix protein 2 (M2, diamonds) interacts with lipidated LC3 (LC3-II) to block autophagosome-to-autolysosome maturation in the host cell. the translocation of LC3-conjugated membranes to the plasma membrane is important for the filamentous budding of IAV. xenophagy inhibits toxoplasma gondii replication in macrophages. a similar mechanism disrupts the membranous structures on which noroviruses replicate. xenophagy inhibits Mycobacterium tuberculosis replication in cultures. the multimembrane vacuoles that support Brucella abortis replication are generated by ATGs that control PI3 kinase activity (ULK1, Beclin-1, and ATG14), but not ATGs required for LC3 conjugation. nonautophagic ATG functions are important for immune signaling pathways that contribute to multi-cellular immunity. lipidated LC3 also contributes to the envelopment and exocytosis of certain herpesviruses during lytic infection. lipidation via ATG12 or ATG16L1 knockdown impairs viral exit and results in the accumulation of viral DNA in the cytosol. d membranes support viral replication as well as autophagosome-mediated exit without lysiss. d membranes are incorporated into the viral envelope and promote viral release during lytic infection. interactions with LC3 are also required for the processing and inclusion of HIV Gag into the virion. the NS3 protease encoded by these and other flaviviruses counteract this inhibition by cleaving the reticulophagy receptor FAM134B. multiple herpesviruses encode proteins that bind and inhibit Beclin-1 to avoid autophagy-mediated targeting to the lysosome. xenophagy inhibits Mycobacterium tuberculosis replication in cultured macrophages. xenophagy inhibits mycobacterium tuberculosis replication in cultured macrophages. a surprising autophagy-independent function of ATG5 in neutrophils. 16L1 deletion causes macrophages to overproduce the cytokine IL-1. deletion of other ATGs throughout the autophagy pathway leads to a general increase in cytokine levels that promote resistance to influenza virus infection. an alternative mechanism involves increased IFN-I production upon disruption of mitophagy. the recruitment of the ATG16L1\u2013ATG5\u2013ATG12 complex to mitochondria decreases MAVS activity. mitochondrial protein TUFM recruits the ATG16L1\u2013ATG5\u2013ATG12 complex to mediate autophagic removal of mitochondria that produce ROS. autophagy further inhibits IFN-I production by removing the signaling intermediate MAVS. conserved autophagy proteins (ATG9L1, ULK1, and Beclin-1) display functions independent of autophagy-related processes. beclin-1 prevents sustained cGAS activation through both direct inhibition and depriving the enzyme of its substrate. NLRP3 inflammasome responds to a variety of stimuli that directly or indirectly cause the release of ROS and DNA from leaky mitochondria. autophagic sequestration of bacteria and lipopolysaccharide inhibits inflammasome activation. removal of damaged vesicles and organelles is likely to explain why inhibiting autophagy proteins such as ATG16L1 enhance IL-1 and IL-18 production. presence of nucleic acid in cytoplasm induces transcription of IFN-I. an alternative mechanism involves increased IFN-I production upon mitophagy. mitochondrial protein TUFM recruits the ATG16L1\u2013ATG5\u2013ATG12 complex to mediate the autophagic removal of mitochondria that produce ROS. a single base substitution that confers the ability of the viral polymerase basic protein 2 to bind TUFM. autophagy further inhibits IFN-I production by removing the signaling intermediate MAVS. beclin-1 prevents sustained signaling by inducing autophagic removal of cytosolic DNA and inhibiting cGAS through direct binding. conserved autophagy proteins (ATG9L1, ULK1 and Beclin-1) display functions independent of autophagy-related processes. inflammasomes induce the cleavage of pro\u2013IL-1 and pro\u2013IL-18 by caspase-1 to generate the activate forms of these cytokines. IBD includes Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis. rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are examples of how ATGs contribute to complex inflammatory diseases. ATG16L1 disrupts secretory autophagy, leading to impaired exocytosis of lysozyme from Paneth cells during Salmonella infection. the effect of ATG16L1T300A on the necroptosis signaling complex likely involves disruption in ATG-mediating immune signaling. 1T300A displays impaired binding with TMEM59, a transmembrane protein that mediates the trafficking of LC3+ vesicles through a process distinct from classic autophagy. the IBD variant of ATG16L1 is not linked to other inflammatory disorders associated with autophagy dysfunction. polymorphisms in a noncoding region of ATG5 is associated with SLE. this is consistent with the role of autophagy in supporting the secretory burden and organelle homeostasis in differentiated B cells. inhibiting autophagy may ameliorate, whereas inhibiting LAP may exacerbate disease. autophagy is based on the genetic analysis of a single individual ATG. it will be critical for future researchers to keep in mind alternative pathways. it will be incumbent on researchers to interrogate multiple ATGs."}
