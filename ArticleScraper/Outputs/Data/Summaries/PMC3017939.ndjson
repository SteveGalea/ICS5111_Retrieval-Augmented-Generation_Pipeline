{"summary": "a novel strain of influenza A (H1N1-2009) has caused a global pandemic. a network model was used to describe temporal variations in the age-specific composition of cases during the course of the pandemic. a network model was used to describe temporal variations in the age-specific composition of cases during the course of the pandemic. the age-dependent matrix, K = R ij, has been quantified using age-stratified epidemic data. first, the dominant eigenvalue of K corresponds to the basic reproduction number, R 0 [16], which often yields a threshold condition. second, the final proportion of hosts of type i that become infected, z i, is given by the solution to 1 z i = exp (j R ij z j) [17]. despite the number of imported cases, it took 39 days to observe the first locally acquired case. the interpretation of Figure 1(a) is affected by several factors such as case ascertainment, ecological factors such as seasonality, and disease control. a similar substantial delay in interregional spread has also been seen in the results of seroepidemiological study in England. a more plausible reason is the contrast in age distributions between local and imported cases. adults are less likely to cause secondary transmissions than children in a local setting. i (i = 1,2) be the recovery rate of infectious individuals of type i and ij(1 i, j 2) be the birth rate of type i infected individuals caused by a single type j infected individual during the initial stage of an epidemic. the initial stages of the outbreak interpreted as a multivariate birth-and-death process. random vector X n = (X 1n, X 2n) represent the number of child and adult infected individuals in the population in the nth generation. we define the probability generating function as F j ( s 1, s 2 ) = x p j ( x 1, x 2 ) s 1 x 1 s 2 x 2, j = 1,2. the extinction probability is the nonnegative root of the equations j = F j we have the probability of extinction p (a) = j = 1 2 j a j (5) of the entire clade with initial vector a = (a 1, a 2). in the two-host population, the probabilities of extinction given a single child or adult infected individual satisfy 1 = 1 1 + R 11 ( 1 1 ) + R 21 ( 1 2 ), 2 = 1 1 + R 12 ( 1 1 ) + R 22 ( 1 2 ). the initial dominant eigenvalues are 1.58 and 1.22, respectively. the child group in Mexico is assumed to be up to age 14 years while that in Japan is up to age 19 years. in (10) represents the proportion of contacts reserved for within-group mixing. if = 1, the mixing is referred to as fully assortative. sensitivity of probabilities of extinction to different in range of 0-1 and R. we consider the probability of extinction given a small importation of ten cases in the zero generation independently entering a large susceptible population at their infection-age 0. we vary the number of adult cases from 0 to 10 and examine the probability of extinction given by (5). a surge in hospitalizations is first seen in Amsterdam followed by Rotterdam. the peak hospitalization rate in Zeeland occurs three weeks later than that in Amsterdam. the spatial heterogeneity in Figure 1(b) may have been associated with differing inflows of infected individuals. in this paper, we use a simple stochastic model to clarify the different roles of children and adults in causing a major epidemic. we use a multitype branching process to approximate the probability of extinction of the clade of infection emanating from a single index case. we label children as type 1 and adults as type 2. if we further ignore the age-specific susceptibility and infectiousness, R ij is determined only by the frequency of contact within- and between-age groups. if we further ignore the age-specific susceptibility and infectiousness, R ij is determined only by the frequency of contact within- and between-age groups. the extinction probability is the nonnegative root of the equations j = F j ( ), j = 1,2. each of the secondary cases of type i generated by a primary case becomes an ancestor of an independent subprocess (which restarts with a type i individual) behaving identically among the same type i [31, 35]. extinction probabilities 1 and 2 for the H1N1-2009 are solved using published estimates of K from Mexico [6] and Japan [2]. the initial eigenvalues are 1.58 and 1.22, respectively. the biological interpretation of proportionate mixing is that irrespective of its own type, an individual can acquire infection from any given individual. the biological interpretation of proportionate mixing is that irrespective of its own type, an individual can acquire infection from any given individual. a single child index case has a potential to cause 8 secondary transmissions. we examine the sensitivity of the probability of extinction to the proportion of adult travelers over various and R. we consider the probability of extinction given a small importation of ten cases independently entering a large susceptible population at their infection-age 0. a more realistic depiction, for example, gamma-distributed generation time, tends to capture overdispersion of the offspring distribution more appropriately [40, 41], and thus again yields a higher probability of extinction than is shown herein. the probability approximately accounts for heterogeneous transmission among and between child and adult populations. the probability of extinction, given a single child index case, reached a minimum with in the range of 0.4-0.5, although this probability was not very sensitive to. such may lead to a \u201cwell-mixed\u201d population, thereby allowing the child index case to involve both child and adult secondary cases effectively. 1%\u201358% over the full range of from 0 to 1, for 10 index cases. the results were independent of the proportion of adult index cases. a 1 + a 2 = 10 and 2 = 1 (for = 1), whatever the number of adults, a 2. study investigated the relationship between the next-generation matrix and the probability of extinction. the modelled heterogeneous mixing accounted for assortativity via an assumption of preferred mixing. the probability of extinction was derived from a multidimentional branching process model. social contact survey revealed age-dependent contact pattern is highly assortative. the definition of a contact can be too broad to be practical for all diseases. a full description of global dynamics should better account for age-specific travel patterns. a full description of global dynamics should better account for age-specific travel patterns. the present study emphasized the importance of capturing type-specificity of index cases in estimating the probability of extinction. we believe our simple exercise successfully illustrated the diminished role of nonmaintenance hosts in causing a major epidemic when assortativity is high."}
