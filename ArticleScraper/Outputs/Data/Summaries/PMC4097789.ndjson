{"summary": "a graduate student in molecular virology at Loyola University Chicago devoted her energy to research in the lab. a background in basic science was helpful but wet lab research was not necessarily a requirement. the medical reserve corps was founded in response to the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001. full-scale exercise began over a month in advance, with training modules being developed and presented to volunteers for each of the roles necessary during the exercise. training modules were very informative, because as a new volunteer, I did not have a good grasp of what my role would be during an emergency. the MRC and the Cook County Department of Public Health conducted a debriefing. the flowthrough of clients constituted key data for the evaluation of the plans of the MRC and the Cook County Department of Public Health. in situations like these, participants from the scientific community could shine. public health postgraduate opportunities for basic scientists are in demand with private corporations, industry, and international organizations. the sooner in an undergraduate or graduate career these options are explored, the sooner an applicant can obtain extracurricular experience that relate to an alternative career path. the sooner an undergraduate or graduate career these options are explored, the sooner an applicant can obtain extracurricular experience that relate to an alternative career path. noAA opportunities are available through the NRC http://sites.nationalacademies.org/pga/rap/ AAAS Science and Technology Policy fellowships Integrates doctoral-level scientists into policy-making decisions within Congress and the executive branch. there are opportunities for fellowships at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels. volunteer opportunities can shape one's career as a scientist in ways inaccessible from the confines of the academic laboratory. it is never too soon to begin considering what to do after graduation, and finding good volunteer opportunities can lead to exciting new fields and career paths that might otherwise go overlooked."}
