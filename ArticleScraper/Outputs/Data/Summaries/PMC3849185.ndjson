{"summary": "phylogenetic analysis of viruses is a useful way to estimate their evolutionary relationships and assign genotypes. the method commonly used for molecular phylogenetic studies for many viruses typically involved sequencing a gene or partial genomic region (phylogenetic marker) in individual representatives of a collection of strains. phylogenetic networks have been developed to infer these evolutionary processes including the recombination events. genomes of porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2), measles virus (MV), hepatitis E virus (HEV) and japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) were used in our calculations. all viruses have been studied to select the appropriate phylogenetic markers. sequences containing gaps in genomic regions would be discarded. if the whole-genome sequences of several strains were identical, only one whole-genome sequence was retained. 43 PCV2 strains, 28 MV strains, 33 HEV strains and 30 JEV strains were used in the general calculations. phylogenetic trees were constructed by Neighbor-joining method. the genome and gene nucleotide sequences of the 43 PCV2 strains, 28 MV strains, 33 HEV strains and 30 JEV strains were all involved in the alignments and tree constructions. evolutionary linear correlation coefficient r (Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient) between them was calculated according to following equation [30]. Xij represents the distance from i virus strain to j virus strain in distance matrix of gene X; Yij represents the distance of strain i to strain j in the distance matrix of genome Y; Yij represents the mean of all Yij values; and N represents the number of viral strains in the matrices. sequences containing gaps in genomic regions would be discarded unless they were clearly confirmed by other studies. 43 PCV2 strains, 28 MV strains, 33 HEV strains and 30 JEV strains were used in the general calculations. large sets of PCV2 sequences were also obtained for another calculation. phylogenetic trees were constructed by Neighbor-joining method. the genome and gene nucleotide sequences of the 43 PCV2 strains, 28 MV strains, 33 HEV strains and 30 JEV strains were all involved in the alignments and tree constructions. evolutionary linear correlation coefficient r (Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient) between them was calculated according to the following equation [30] for gene X from its whole genome Y, the evolutionary linear correlation coefficient r (Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient) between them was calculated according to the following equation. phylogenetic trees based on the genomes and each gene of the four viruses were constructed separately for comparison. for all the viruses, the individual gene trees differed not only from the corresponding genome tree, but from the trees constructed from the other genes in the same genome, in both their topologies and branch lengths in a way. the trees of gene E, NS1 and NS5 could agree well with the genome tree. however, it was hard to access which one from the genes NS2a, NS2b, NS3, NS4b and PreM could yield a tree more concordant with the genome tree due to different discordance involving different virus strains. 0.940 0.766 R-values (120) 0.940 0.767 R-values (220) 0.961 0.790 The numbers in the parentheses indicate the numbers of viral strains used for the calculations. for the trees based on sequences from MV, the topologies did not differ dramatically among them. but our data showed that the 8 genes shared different correlation coefficient values with the genome. the r-values are shown as boxes-and-whiskers plots. our results suggested that the r-values could vary with the sample selection to some degree. however, the trend for each gene was clear enough to estimate its reliability. data points (five points each set) comprises the r-values calculated from randomly selected samples of one specific sample number. the whiskers go from the highest to the lowest point. phylogenetic trees based on the genomes and each gene of the four viruses were constructed separately for comparison. the trees of region GO and KLY-B differed dramatically from the genome trees in topologies. but it was hard to estimate which tree from the genes NS2a, NS2b, NS3, NS4b and PreM could yield a tree more concordant with the genome tree. genes for PCV2 cap rep R-values (33) 0.983 0.938 0.933 0.983 0.983 0.972 Genes for PCV2 cap rep R-values (43) 0.940 0.766 R-values (120) 0.940 0.767 R-values (220) 0.961 0.790 The numbers in the parentheses indicate the numbers of viral strains used for the calculations. the evolutionary histories of genes could differ greatly. for example, the cap and rep genes in PCV2 shared an evolutionary r-value of 0.55. the r-values are shown as boxes-and-whiskers plots. r-values between individual genes and its whole genome of PCV2 based on different sample sources and sizes. each set comprises the r-values calculated from randomly selected samples of one specific sample number, presented as box-and-whisker plots. the cap gene correlated more strongly and more stably with the full genome than the rep gene in its evolutionary rate. this is consistent with our phylogenetic analysis based on tree comparison. the cap gene was a more reliable phylogenetic marker for PCV2 strains because it was able to reconstruct the same tree as the whole viral genome. region showed the highest r-value (0.983) with the full genome. a limited number of samples can negatively affect the sensitivity of the method. an insufficient sample size, which was less than 10, may negatively affect the stability and reliability of r-values. a reliable estimate can be made when the calculation is based on a sufficient number of representative strains. in practice, the r-values would be calculated based on several groups of randomly selected strain sources with the sufficient number. a high consistency between individual genes and their whole genome can be considered as a good signature of a phylogenetic marker for some viruses. the topology of the cap gene tree was clearly inconsistent with that of the genome tree and other gene trees. trees constructed from the regions GO and KLY-B differed dramatically from the genome trees in topology. it was difficult to determine which of the regions SGG-A, MJ-C, and MXJ generates the tree most similar to the genome tree.
