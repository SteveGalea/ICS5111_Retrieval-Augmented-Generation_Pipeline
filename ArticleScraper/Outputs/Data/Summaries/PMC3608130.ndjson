{"summary": "Bordetella bronchiseptica is a Gram-negative bacterium capable of colonizing the respiratory tract of a large range of mammalian hosts. kennel cough in dogs, atrophic rhinitis in pigs, snuffles and pneumonia in rabbits. in dogs, B. bronchiseptica causes tracheobronchitis with two patterns of histological lesions. virulence factors have been implicated in damaging the host cells. toxins include adenylate cyclase toxin, dermonecrotic toxin, the type III secretion system and adhesins. Bacteria B. bronchiseptica 0301 was isolated from rabbits with clinical symptoms of rhinitis or pneumonia. samples were collected from nares or trachea, cultured on brain heart infusion agar (BHI), and were stored in 10% glycerol at 70\u00b0C until use. LPS precipitate was suspended in physiological saline solution (PSS), centrifuged at 2,000 g for 30 min, and dialyzed against sterile DW. an additional five mice were injected with sterile PSS. first five mice were euthanized when clinical signs appeared. cesarean sections were anesthetized with 5 mg/Kg xylazine, 35 mg/Kg ketamine. the sections were then freed of skin, bone and turbinate. the septa were washed tree times with Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium. tissue processing For morphological analysis, tissues were semithin sectioned (0.5 m thick) three semithin sections were obtained from each sample and stained with toluidine blue. changes to the respiratory epithelium exposed to whole B. bronchiseptica and to B. bronchiseptica were quantitatively and semiquantitatively evaluated. a primary antibody; as a secondary conjugate, protein G (Sigma Biochemicals, St. Louis, MO, USA) labeled with peroxidase was used. septa of rabbits suffering from a natural disease and from which B. bronchiseptica had been isolated were included as negative controls. samples were collected from nares or trachea, cultured on brain heart infusion agar. bacterium was suspended in distilled water with 0.1% thimerosal at 4\u00b0C. cells were centrifuged at 2,500 g for 50 min in sterile DW. the cells were centrifuged at 2,500 g for 50 min in sterile DW. inactivated bacteria were suspended in DW, treated with 90% phenol v/v for 30 min at 68\u00b0C, and stored at 4\u00b0C for 24 h. the antiserum was immunoadsorbed with fetal rabbit turbinate macerates to eliminate cross-reaction with rabbit tissues. one mL of antiserum was admixed with 1 mL macerate, washed with PSS, and centrifuged at 133 g for 1 h at room temperature. the supernatant contained the immunoadsorbed antiserum and was kept at \u201320\u00b0C until use fetal rabbit nasal septa exposed to B. bronchiseptica LPS was submerged in 0.1 M Sorenson's sodium phosphate buffer. tissue was decalcified in 10% EDTA for 7 days, washed in buffer phosphate, and postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide. pyknosis and karyorrhexis were quantified over 120 epithelial cells. a semiquantitative analysis of the activity of the goblet cells, detritus and mucus in the lumen was also performed. the presence and localization of bacteria on the respiratory epithelium were evaluated. nasal septa were incubated with a lectin-enzyme conjugate which consisted of lectin from Limulus polyphemus (LPA) conjugated to the alkaline phosphatase enzyme (Alkaline Phosphatase Conjugated Limulus polyphemus Lectin Horseshoe Crab, EY Laboratories Inc., USA) which binds specifically to the sugar 2-keto-3-deoxyocton the changes in the epithelium of exposed septa were significantly different (P 0.005) than negative controls. cytoplasmic vacuolation and reactive changes, such as increased goblet cell activity, were also significantly different (P 0.05) than negative controls. dead cells (DC), desquamated cells (Des), vacuolated cells (Vac) and goblet cell activity (PMN) are indicated. bars with different letters have statistical difference with significance level of 95% (P 0.05). fetal rabbit nasal septum respiratory epithelium not exposed to B. bronchiseptica LPS. negative goblet cell cytoplasm is shown by 40x magnified lectin histochemistry. ated border of the epithelium lectin-histochemistry of B. bronchiseptica stained almost exclusively within goblet cell cytoplasm. Dead cells (DC), goblet cell activity (GC), desquamated cells (Des), vacuolation (Vac) and infiltration of PMN are indicated. bars with different letters have statistical difference with significance level of 95% (P 0.05). Respiratory epithelial cell death and PMN infiltration were significantly different (P 0.005) than negative controls. cellular degeneration, such as cytoplasmic vacuolation and reactive changes, were also significantly different (P 0.05) than negative controls. bars with different letters have statistical difference with significance level of 95% (P 0.05) control fetal rabbit nasal septum respiratory epithelium exposed to B. bronchiseptica. positive staining of ciliated border is indicated. negative control fetal rabbit nasal septum respiratory epithelium not exposed to B. bronchiseptica LPS. a 100x magnified lectin histochemistry is shown. controls did not show a similar reaction. a detailed study of the cellular changes caused by some of the virulence factors of this pathogen in cell cultures has been reported [31\u201333]. in this work, we successfully developed a nasal septa tissue culture from fetal rabbits to study the first steps of infection with B. bronchiseptica. as early as 2 hours postexposure to B. bronchiseptica or its LPS, several degenerative, reactive, and deadly changes were present in the respiratory epithelial cells. this consisted of cytoplasmic vacuolation, activation of GC, infiltration of PMN and dead cells within the epithelial layer or desquamated into the lumen. a similar finding has been described in vivo in rabbits experimentally infected with Pasteurella multo enlargement of cells observed in epithelia exposed to B. bronchiseptica or its LPS could not be explained without any increase in size of their cytoplasm. this increase need not be due to a higher synthesis of mucin, but it is more likely due to a looser arrangement (due to hygroscopy) of the granula contents or the fusion of their membranes prior to expulsion. the activity apparently lies in the ability of BopC and BopB to induce the formation of pores in the cytoplasmic membrane of eukaryotic cells. the dying cells seem necrotic rather than apoptotic, showing cytoplasmic swelling and extensive membrane blebbing without nuclear changes. the difference in the number of PMN induced by B. bronchiseptica LPS and B. bronchiseptica bacteria could be explained by selective activation induced by the LPS of the PMN through its PAMP recognition receptors. the difference in the number of PMN induced by the bacterium could be explained by selective activation induced by the LPS of the PMN through its PAMP recognition receptors. B. bronchiseptica immunostaining indicated that bacteria were distributed mainly on the ciliated border of the epithelium and less frequently in detritus and mucus accumulated in the lumen. a lectin-like activity for heparin and other sulfated carbohydrates has also been identified in B. bronchiseptica and B. pertussis. we successfully established a nasal septum culture from rabbit fetuses. the bacterium and its GC cytoplasm mucosubstance-associated LPS induce very similar lesions on the septal respiratory epithelium after 2 h."}
