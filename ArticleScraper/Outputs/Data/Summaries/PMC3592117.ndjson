{"summary": "a new genus has been proposed after the identification of the provisionally named Lloviu virus (LLOV) in dead insectivorous bats. the most recently identified species, BEBOV, caused an outbreak in 2007 with 131 cases. RESTV appears to be nonpathogenic in humans, although it can cause lethal illness in nonhuman primates. filoviruses infect and kill a wide range of host cells. several cell surface proteins have been reported to be virus receptors or attachment factors. virus is internalized via macropinocytosis and translocated to cellular compartments. es using GAGs include herpes simplex viruses (HSV) (20, 21), human papillomavirus (HPV) (22), vaccinia virus (24), Sindbis virus (25), respiratory syncytial virus (26, 27), noroviruses (28), adeno-associated virus (29), dengue virus (31), hepatitis C virus (31), human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) (32 cDNA encoding the MARV Ravn GP was amplified by PCR. cDNA encoding the MARV Ravn GP was amplified by PCR. virions were subjected to ultracentrifuge concentration at 28,000 rpm in an SW. the pellets were resuspended overnight in Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS) at 4\u00b0C. Virus-like particles (VLPs) were produced by caCl2 transfection of 293T cells with a 2:1 ratio of Bla-VP40. the membrane was incubated with a 1:5,000 dilution of peroxidase-conjugated goat antimouse antibody. the membrane was then washed with TBS\u20130.05% Tween 20 three times for 10 min each. immunoreactive proteins were visualized using an imageQuant LAS 400 imager. se I from Flavobacterium heparinum (Sigma) in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 4 mM CaCl, 50 mM NaCl, and 0.01% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h at room temperature. supernatant was removed and 200 l of fresh medium was added to the cells and incubated for 48 h at 37\u00b0C. supernatant was removed and 200 l of fresh medium was added to the cells. aliquots of the virus were stored at 80\u00b0C at 8 days postinfection. cells were seeded in a 6-well plate 24 h prior to infection in DMEM (Invitrogen) containing d-glucose (4,500 mg/liter) and l-glutamine and supplemented with 2% heat-inactivated FBS (DMEM-2). cells were incubated for 2 h with compound before infection with EBOV for an additional 30 min at a multiplicity of infection. human primary monocyte-derived macrophages were isolated as previously described (34) and cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% human serum and penicillin-streptomycin (15 U/ml). fetal livers were obtained from elective abortions with the approval of the committee for human research at the University of California, San Francisco. virions subjected to ultracentrifuge concentration at 28,000 rpm in an SW28 rotor. pellets were resuspended overnight in Hanks balanced salt solution. plasmids were produced by caCl2 transfection of 293T cells. the membrane was then incubated in TBS\u20130.05% Tween 20 with a 1:200 dilution of anti-p24 mouse sera for 1 h at room temperature. after 3 washes, 10 min each, the membrane was incubated with a 1:5,000 dilution of peroxidase-conjugated goat antimouse antibody. immunoreactive proteins were visualized using an imageQuant LAS 400 imager (GE Healthcare) cells were seeded at 2 104 in 96-well plates 24 h prior to infection. medium was removed, and cells were incubated with heparinase I from flavobacterium heparinum (Sigma) in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 4 mM CaCl, 50 mM NaCl, and 0.01% bovine serum albumin (BSA) cells were seeded at 2 104 in 96-well plates 24 h prior to infection. medium was removed, and the cells were incubated with the appropriate amounts of dendrimeric peptides SB105-A10. supernatant was removed, and 200 l of fresh medium was added to the cells. aliquots of the virus were stored at 80\u00b0C. cells were seeded in a 6-well plate 24 h prior to infection in DMEM (Invitrogen) containing d-glucose (4,500 mg/liter) and l-glutamine. the cells were incubated for 2 h with compound before infection with EBOV for an additional 30 min at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. binding of filovirus GP to immobilized heparin was tested. lentiviral particles were eluted and analyzed for presence of HIV p24 antigen. heparin beads captured all of the particles bearing filovirus envelopes. heparin-bound virus was detected by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. heparin-bound virus was subsequently eluted with 2 M NaCl. 293T cells were infected with infectivity-normalized pseudotypes. inhibition of infection by DS was significantly lower than that by heparin and CSA. this indicates that the inhibitory effect of GAGs on transduction is mediated by both electrostatic charge and the sequence of the carbohydrate moieties. this confirms that infection mediated by Lassa virus GP is independent of GAGs. soluble heparin inhibited infection mediated by EBOV GP in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) by up to 90% and TAFV GP by up to 30%. both EBOV and MARV Ravn but not Lassa virus pseudotype infection of human macrophages was also strongly affected by heparin in a concentration-dependent manner. mediated infection of human primary umbilical vein endothelial cells (A), human fetal liver cells (B), and human macrophages (C) the cells were infected with concentrated HIV pseudotypes bearing the different filovirus envelope glycoproteins in the presence or absence of different concentrations of soluble heparin (g/ml) heparinase I treatment of primary HUVEC cells resulted in 50% reduction of EBOV VLP transduction. HSPGs mediate attachment of filoviruses to the cells. results are expressed as percentages of results with no heparinase. -carrageenan is more heavily sulfated than most tissue-derived heparan sulfate. our data indicate that efficient filovirus GP-mediated infection requires GAGs and more specifically HS. a strong dose-dependent inhibition of pseudotypes bearing filovirus envelopes was observed in Huh7 and 293T cells. SB105-A10 exerts its inhibition by binding to HS on the cell surface and thus antagonizes virus attachment to the target cells (49\u201351). this novel peptide-derivatized dendrimer is based on the M6 prototype (52), a tetrabranched dendrimer synthesized on a lysine core, which tethers four 10-mer peptide chains in lysine alpha and epsilon positions antiviral activity of dendrimeric peptide SB105-A10 stems from the specific amino acid sequence of the peptides. results are expressed as percentages of inhibition and represent the means SD for duplicate wells. EBOV was incubated with different concentrations of soluble heparin or carrageenan. heparin-bound particles were eluted and analyzed for the presence of HIV p24 antigen. soluble heparin was able to elute bound filovirus pseudotypes from the heparin beads at a concentration of 50 mg/ml. these results demonstrate that filovirus GPs, but not Lassa virus GP, possess the ability to bind heparin. bound virus was subsequently eluted with 2 M NaCl. inhibition was similar for the different GPs, with the exception of TAFV. this difference was statistically significant (P 0.01 when comparing TAFV to EBOV) differences in inhibition were not merely a reflection of levels of expression. 293T cells were infected with concentrated HIV pseudotypes bearing different concentrations of soluble heparin, chondroitin sulfate A, dermatan sulfate, or heparan sulfate. results are representative of at least three different experiments. soluble heparin inhibits EBOV GP-mediated infection of human primary umbilical vein endothelial cells (A), human fetal liver cells (B), and human macrophages. heparinase digestion decreased cell susceptibility to filovirus GP-mediated infection. digestion of 293T cells with increasing concentrations of either heparinase I or heparinase III resulted in a maximum reduction of EBOV and MARV pseudotype infectivity of approximately 50%. infectivity of Lassa virus pseudotypes remained unaffected. results are expressed as percentages of results with no heparinase. the results are representative of at least three different experiments. carrageenan, a type of sulfated polysaccharide extracted from red algae, inhibits the infection of several human viral pathogens that utilize HS as an attachment factor. the results are representative of at least three different experiments. similar results were observed with 293T cells. a peptide dendrimer, SB105-A10, has been developed as a potent inhibitor of several viruses. pretreatment of Huh7 cells with SB105-A10 1 h before infection produced a significant concentration-dependent inhibition of both MARV and EBOV pseudotypes. this antiviral activity is neither virus strain specific nor cell type specific, since similar effects were observed in 293T cell infection with three additional Ebola virus GPs. heparin (50% inhibitory concentration [IC50] = 8) and carrageenan (IC50 = 3.162) inhibited EBOV replication in vero cells. up to 1-log differences in PFU achieved even at the lowest concentration (1 g/ml) a role for GP/GAG interactions in filovirus infection and pathogenesis is likely. the findings are supported by the loss of infectivity in primary cells using filamentous VLPs following heparinase treatment cleaving heparin. cross-linking of HSPGs has been demonstrated to facilitate the trafficking of soluble proteins into cells via macropinocytosis (55, 56), the major route of ingress for EBOV (13, 14) drastic effects in virus-cell interactions caused by proteins involved in bridging virion envelope lipids to Axl have been described. previous studies showed discrepancies between the entry mechanism of EBOV when utilizing different pseudotype systems (retroviral versus rhabdoviral) (13, 14) these studies suggest that rhabdovirus particles seem to mimic the EBOV virion more closely (13) rhabdoviral particles seem to mimic the EBOV virion more closely (13) er SB105-A10 are potent inhibitors of many viruses that act via binding to HSPGs on the cell surface (49\u201351) filoviruses use HSPGs and possibly other cell surface GAGs for the initial attachment to their target cells."}
