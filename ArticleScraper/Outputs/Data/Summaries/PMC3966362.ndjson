{"summary": "fecal specimens were diluted with 10 mmol/L phosphate-buffered saline to prepare a 10% suspension, shaken at 4\u00b0C for 1 h, and clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 30 min. RNA was extracted by using the MagNA Pure LC Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit. all PCR products were purified by using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA) and cloned into the TA cloning vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen). nucleotide sequencing was conducted by using an ABI 3130 Genetic Analyzer Automated Aequencer. ferret HEV genomes consist of 6,820 nt and a poly (A) tail. nucleotide sequence identity was 99.6%. ferret HEV strains from the united states encode 1,589 aa. 96\u2013597 (Thr) and 631\u2013632 (Ile) and 9 aa deletions in amino acid residues 645\u2013653 (Cys-Leu-Arg-Ser-Ser-Pro-Lys-Pro-Pro) correspond to those of strains from the Netherlands. an additional putative 183-aa ORF 4 (nt 30\u2013581) was found in strains from the united states. et HEV (AB890374) Genotype 1 (NC-001434) 53.6 51.4 58.9 50.3 51.4 56.9 22.2 Genotype 2 (M74506) 53.8 51.7 59.3 49.4 56.0 57.2 25.2 Genotype 3 (AF060668) 55.2 53.6 59.4 47.9 54.5 58.1 22.9 Genotype 4 (AJ272108) 53.9 51.5 59.5 49.4 53.5 57.5 28.8 Wild nucleic acid sequence alignment was performed by using Kimura\u2019s 2-parameter method. phylogenetic trees with 1,000 bootstrap replicates were generated by using neighbor-joining method. items in boldface indicate strains isolated in this study. further studies are needed to confirm the pathogenicity and zoonotic potential of ferret HEV."}
