RNA-seq data were quantified with kallisto, and then within-sample and between-sample normalization was performed using sleuth, which is based on DESeq. the VCF was filtered to select all variants within the linkage mapping confidence interval (V:11042745\u201311189364) Variants with a minor allele frequency 0.05 within the 83 wild isolates that have a bleomycin median optical density measurement were deemed \u201crare\u201d. file S9 contains information on all genes in the QTL confidence interval plus 20 kb on either side. File S10 contains locations of the exons, introns, and transcription start and stop sites for all genes in the region. genetic differences underlie bleomycin-response variation Bleomycin causes double-stranded DNA breaks. exposure to bleomycin can affect development of C. elegans larvae and germ-cell production of adult animals. we measured each of the 26 fitness parameters for 249 RIAILs. correlations between each pairwise combination of the 26 HTA measurements revealed several clusters of highly correlated traits. ins with the N2 allele at peak marker had a lower median optical density in bleomycin. each of 13,003 genomic markers, split by chromosome, were tested for correlation with phenotypic variation across the RIAIL panel. each significant QTL is indicated by a red triangle at peak marker. the reciprocal NIL with the CB4856 locus introgressed into the N2 background (ECA232) was statistically more sensitive to bleomycin than CB4856 (Figure S6 and File S7, P = 1.3e14, Tukey HSD). this phenotype indicated that the reciprocal NIL with the CB4856 locus introgressed into the N2 background (ECA232) had a bleomycin-response pheno both of these strains were more sensitive to bleomycin than the background parental strain, CB4856. this result could suggest that the introgressed region shared between these strains conferred some bleomycin-response variation between the N2 and CB4856 strains. however, ECA528 was much more sensitive to bleomycin than ECA411 (Figure 2 and File S7) the 147 kb confidence interval on chromosome V contains 93 genes. the 147 kb confidence interval on chromosome V contains 93 genes. five genes contain predicted nonsynonymous variants. variants could cause differential bleomycin sensitivity between the N2 and CB4856 strains. genes with nonsynonymous variants between the N2 and CB4856 strains are shown as red arrows. jmjd-5 deletion alleles in the N2 and the CB4856 backgrounds were each more resistant to bleomycin than their respective parental strains. the deletion alleles of C45B11.8, C45B11.6, srg-42 and cnc-10 each had a bleomycin response similar to the respective parent genetic background. allele-replacement strains with the CB4856 allele in the N2 genetic background jmjd-5(N2 to CB4856) were significantly different from the N2 parental strain, but these strains were more sensitive to bleomycin than N2. this increased sensitivity was unexpected, because the CB4856 allele at the jmjd-5 locus should confer increased sensitivity. the QTL explained 43.58% of phenotypic variation among the RIAILs. the causal variant should have a clear impact on bleomycin response. the nematode-specific gene H19N07.3 impacts bleomycin response. we identified 4326 expression QTL (eQTL) across the genome. of the 118 genes in the 187 kb surrounding the bleomycin-response QTL, expression for 50 genes were measured. eQTL for two of those four genes, H19N07.3 and cnc-10, overlapped with the bleomycin-response QTL. RIAIL gene expression (y-axis) is split by allele at the peak marker. RIAILs containing the N2 allele (orange) are compared to RIAILs containing the CB4856 allele (blue) each point is the H19N07 expression of an individual strain. scb-1 deletion strains had no significant differences in the control condition. bleomycin sensitivity of the scb-1 deletion strains was not caused by control-condition phenotypes. scb-1 expression differences may cause the bleomycin-response variation between the parental strains. we performed RNA-seq of the N2 and CB4856 strains to assess scb-1 expression differences between the parental strains. this result could be caused by the low sample size (n = 3) in the RNA-seq experiment. natural variation in scb-1 function underlies bleomycin-response differences. differences in bleomycin-response function might be regulated by a rare variant. scb-1 gene expression may underlie bleomycin response differences. each marker that reached a significance threshold determined by eigenvalue decomposition of the SNP correlation matrix is colored in red. we identified all single nucleotide variants (SNVs), small insertion/deletions (indels) and structural variants (SVs) present in these 83 strains for which the CB4856 strain contains the alternate allele. b-1 identified homologs in nine other species using a BLASTp search. none of the homologs of SCB-1 have previously identified functions. we used Phyre2 to predict protein domains within the SCB-1 protein. two of the strains used in the dose response assay, N2 and CB4856, have been extensively characterized at the genome level. RIAILs were previously constructed between these two strains. RIAILs have been leveraged to identify genetic variants that cause phenotypic differences between the two strains. the QTL on the center of chromosome V strongly impacts bleomycin response. we performed linkage mapping on the residual median optical density measurements in bleomycin. the QTL was highly significant (explained 43.58% of the total variation and 55.60% of the genetic variation) phenotypes are shown as Tukey box plots with the phenotypes of each individual strain shown as points behind the box plots. we isolated this QTL in a controlled genetic background by generating NILs (Files S5 and S6) that each contain a genetic background derived from either the N2 or CB4856 strain and a region of chromosome V from the opposite parental genotype. the genotypes of ECA411 and ECA528 differ in a small region of chromosome V that includes the QTL confidence interval. both of these strains were more sensitive to bleomycin than the background parental strain, CB4856. this result could suggest that the introgressed region shared between these strains conferred some bleomycin-response variation between these strains. the linkage mapping confidence interval is from 11,042,745 to 11,189,364 bp on chromosome V. each point is a biological replicate. chromosomal representations of chromosome V are shown for each strain in (A) the 147 kb confidence interval on chromosome V contains 93 genes. five genes, C45B11.8, C45B11.6, jmjd-5, srg-42, and cnc-10, contain predicted nonsynonymous variants between the N2 and CB4856 strains. depictions of each deletion allele are shown below the phenotype for each candidate gene. white rectangles indicate exons, and diagonal lines indicate introns. the region of the gene that was deleted by CRISPR-Cas9 directed genome editing is shown as a red bar beneath each gene model. we tested if the nonsynonymous variant in jmjd-5 between the N2 and CB4856 strains caused bleomycin-response differences. at residue 338 of JMJD-5, the N2 strain has a proline, whereas the CB4856 strain has a serine. the NIL with the CB4856 genotype across the QTL was not different from the N2 parental strain. it remained unclear whether an allele replacement of jmjd-5 in the CB4856 background could confer resistance. the causal variant should have a clear impact on bleomycin response. the nematode-specific gene H19N07.3 impacts bleomycin variation. no of the genes with a nonsynonymous variant between the N2 and CB4856 strains explained the QTL. we identified 4326 expression QTL (eQTL) across the genome. each of 13,003 genomic markers, split by chromosome, were tested for correlation with H19N07.3 expression variation across the RIAIL panel. this gene does not have a nonsynonymous variant between the N2 and CB4856 strains. each H19N07.3 deletion strain was more sensitive to bleomycin than the respective parental strains. these results suggest that H19N07.3 function is required for resistance to bleomycin. we renamed this gene scb-1 for sensitivity to bleomycin. RIAILs with the CB4856 allele at the QTL peak marker have increased expression of scb-1 and increased bleomycin resistance compared to RIAILs with the N2 allele. scb-1 expression differences might cause the bleomycin-response variation between the parental strains. to test the role of natural variation in scb-1 function, we performed a reciprocal hemizygosity test in control and bleomycin conditions. the hemizygous strain with the CB4856 allele of scb-1 had a bleomycin phenotype similar to the heterozygous strain. the hemizygous strain with the N2 allele of scb-1 was more sensitive to bleomycin than the hetero six QTL regions were identified from the GWA. none of these QTL regions overlapped the QTL from linkage mapping. therefore, the CB4856 strain might have a rare variant that underlies its increase in bleomycin resistance compared to the N2 strain. of the 72 rare variants, 44 were unique to CB4856 within this set of 83 strains. one or more of these 44 variants could underlie the bleomycin-response QTL. further work must be performed to identify which, if any, of these variants underlies the bleomycin-response difference between N2 and CB4856. cnc-10, did not impact bleomycin responses. scb-1 deletions and RIAILs with lower scb-1 expression levels show increased bleomycin sensitivity. the function of scb-1, and particularly how it regulates bleomycin response, remains unknown. we used the amino acid sequence of SCB-1 to query the Phyre2 database. this result could suggest that SCB-1 might function as a hydrolase, which could be the mechanism by which scb-1 regulates cellular stress. this finding would be similar to clinical studies that have suggested a role for BLMH in bleomycin-response variation. scb-1 gene lies within a toxin-response QTL hotspot on chromosome V. previous studies have leveraged linkage mapping and GWA in C. elegans to identify genetic variants that underlie drug-response differences. scb-1 deletions showed increased bleomycin sensitivity in both parental backgrounds. expression variation among the RIAIL panel mapped to the same locus as the bleomycin response QTL. scb-1 deletions showed increased bleomycin sensitivity in both parental backgrounds."}
