{"summary": "genomic sequencing of deNV-3 strains collected from different geographical locations and isolation years were determined. the sequence diversity as well as selection pressure sites in the DENV genome other than within the E gene were also analyzed. occurrences of dengue epidemics in the past 30 years have been characterized by rising incidence rates of infection. rising incidence of DF and DHF are related to increased distribution of A. aegypti, global urbanization and rapid and frequent international travel. epidemiological analysis reveals some DENV strains are associated with mild epidemics with low occurrences of DHF cases and inefficient virus transmission. the genome contains a single open reading frame (ORF) that encodes a polyprotein. each serotype of DENV is composed of phylogenetically distinct clusters. each genotype is also composed of phylogenetically distinct \"groups\" or \"clades\" the re-emergence of dengue outbreaks in Taiwan started when DENV-2 was re-introduced into the off-islet of Hsiao-Liu-Chiu in 1981. in 1987\u20131988, another large-scale DENV-1 outbreak occurred in Kaohsiung and Pingtung in southern Taiwan. six DENV-3 isolates were selected for full-length sequencing. the isolates were isolated from indigenous DF patients during the 1998 epidemic in Tainan, Taiwan. four local isolates obtained from Taiwan during previous years were also used. the remaining three 1994 DENV-3 isolates were sequenced only from the 5' NCR to the COOH-terminus of the E gene region for phylogenetic analysis. the remaining three were sequenced only from the 5' NCR to the COOH-terminus of the E gene region for phylogenetic analysis. sumatra DSS 1998 98901437 I\" AB189126 Indonesia, Sumatra DSS 1998 98901403 I\" AB189125 Brazil DSS 2002 BR74886/02 III\" AY679147 Martiniquw\" 1999 D3/H/IMTSSA-MART/1999/1243 III\" AY099336 Taiwan(Kaoshiung) DF 1995 95TW466 I AP61 2, C6/36 1 In this study Taiwan (T RNA genomic 5' and 3' terminal 20 nucleotide sequences were not confirmed independently and were assumed to be of the same length and sequence as the prototype strain H87. total of 25 complete genomic sequences of DENV-3 strains and one DENV-1 strain A88 were aligned using the multiple sequences alignment ClustalX [26]. model, GTR, was selected to be the best fit to the data using the hierarchical likelihood ratio tests (hLRTs) and Akaine information criterion (AIC) the estimated parameter values from this model were as follows: relative substitution rates among nucleotides were A C = 1.6120, A G = 9.5789, A T = 1.7255, C G = 0.6272. in Bayesian method are randomly chosen, and multiple runs of the same dataset are made with different starting trees. output trees were sampled every 100 generations but the first 1,000 trees were discarded before the process reached the convergence state. the resulting trees were rooted using a DENV-1 strain A88 isolate as described. a suspected and confirmed dengue case was defined as previously described and confirmed by both laboratories. a suspected and confirmed dengue case was defined as previously described and confirmed by both laboratories. six DENV-3 isolates were selected for full-length sequencing. deNV-3 strains, four local isolates obtained from Taiwan during previous years, were also used for comparison. four strains isolated from indigenous DF patients during the 1994\u201395 epidemic in Kaohsiung. four strains isolated from indigenous DF patients during the 1994\u201395 epidemic.

Genotype III of DENV-3 consists of the strains from Sri Lanka, India, Africa and Samoa that were recently introduced into Central and South America. the tree was rooted using DENV-1 strain A88 as the outgroup. only four DENV-3 genotypes, including representatives of genotype I (98TW366), genotype II (98TW349), genotype III (98TW628) and genotype V (H87) were compared. the results suggest that both structural and non-structural genes of DENV-3 were under neutral selection. the E gene showed positive selection ( = 2.15) with statistical significance (p = 0.01) when using the larger dataset with 73 sequences. the major amino acid changes along lineages within genotype I and II are also labeled. Taiwan DENV-3 isolates are marked with a star. isolated in recent years, compared to the prototype strain H87. in the 3' NCR, nucleotide changes at position 111, 129, 220 and 438 were observed from the strains circulating recently, which differ from the strain H87. however, none of these changes had any effect on the predicted secondary structure of the 3' NCR RNA. the putative genome cyclization sequence UCAAUAUG was conserved in all DENV-3 viruses. phylogenetic analysis revealed that these viruses belong to different genotypes. compared to the prototype strain H87, several unique amino acid substitutions were found within the full genomic sequences of selected DENV-3 isolates from Taiwan or other countries. onine (T) to alanine (A) at position 112 of the C region, leucine (L) to histidine (H) at position 55 of the prM region, isoleucine (I) to T at position 115 of the NS3 region, and lysine (K) to T and aspartic acid (D) to asparagine (N) at positions 585 and 835 of the NS5 region. similar signature sites experiencing amino acid property 124 S L L P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P phylogenetic trees of DENV-3 were constructed from two different nucleic acid dataset alignments. partial sequences of the prM and E gene region (prM/E) from 10 isolates from Taiwan and 185 sequences available from GenBank. only the posterior probability tree derived from the Bayesian method based on the complete E gene sequences is shown. the 99TW628 strain, isolated in 1999 from Tainan in Taiwan, belongs to this genotype. genome IV consists of the 80-2 strain isolated from china in 1980, the H87 strain isolated from the Philippines in 1956 and the Japanese isolate from an imported case in 1977. sequence divergence in nucleotide and amino acid sequence among different regions of full-length sequences of different genotypes of DENV-3. only four genotypes, including representatives of genotype I (98TW366), genotype II (98TW349), genotype III (98TW628) and genotype V (H87) were compared. the results suggest that both structural and non-structural genes of DENV-3 were under neutral selection. the results suggest that both structural and non-structural genes of DENV-3 were under neutral selection. in the 5' and 3' NCR, positions 62, 90, 109 and 112 had nucleotide changes that were distinguishable for the specific genotype. a G to A change at position 62 was frequently seen in genotype I, a C to T change at position 90 and a G to A change at position 109 were observed only in genotype III. the putative genome cyclization sequence UCAAUAUG, located between nucleotides 38 and 46 of the C gene, was conserved in all DENV-3 viruses. discussions and conclusion Viral sequence comparisons among isolates from dengue epidemics of different disease severities may provide valuable information regarding the molecular basis of the epidemic potential of the virus. this stimulates a great interest in understanding the molecular relationship of DENV-3 isolates in Taiwan during inter-epidemic periods and multiple genotypes of DENV-3 circulated in Indonesia. this observation is consistent with a previous study. a single 1999 isolate was grouped together with the genotype III Sri Lanka isolates. the precise cause of the increased rate of amino acid change in the NS2A gene is unknown. the flavivirus NS2A protein is cleaved by viral serine protease. a mutation at the basic P1 cleavage site residue in NS2A blocks this processing event and is lethal for virus production while still allowing RNA replication. strains of DENV-3 isolated prior to 1992 may have been replaced by two new locally evolving strains. this could be a sign of a new genotype evolving in Thailand. however, most mutations or substitutions occurring were deleterious. the strain isolated in 1999 from a indigenous dengue patient was more closely related to the lineage of the DENV-3 genotype III Sri Lankan strain isolated before 1989. a greater DHF epidemic, especially in adult cases, was caused by the DENV-3 strains isolated after 1998. the study was supported by the grants from the national health research institute (NHRI), Taipei, Taiwan and the national science council (NSC#90-2320-B-002-200)"}
