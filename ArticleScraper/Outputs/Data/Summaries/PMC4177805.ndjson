{"summary": "background Respiratory viral infections can induce different cytokine/chemokine profiles in lung tissues. there is little information about the systemic cytokine status in viral respiratory-infected patients compared with non-asthmatic patients. circulating blood levels of several cytokines have been reported to be increased during viral respiratory tract infections. these cytokines may represent inflammatory markers with different profiles in asthmatic and non-asthmatic patients. the aim of this study was to describe changes in several inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, TNF-), Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5), and chemokines as MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) and RANTES (regulated on the activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) in the systemic circulation during acute viral infection in patients with an asthmatic and non-asthmatic background. no patients were treated with antibiotics, anti-alergics, or steroid when blood samples were obtained. no patients were treated with antibiotics, anti-alergics, or steroid when blood samples were obtained. the results were expressed as pg/ml in samples from serum and pg/mg of protein from culture supernatants. monocyte cultures were obtained from heparinized venous blood from five healthy adult donors. the significance of differences was tested by anova and the Bonferroni post hoc test. two-tailed P values 005 were considered statistically significant. asthmatic patients were selected according to the criteria of the Global Initiative for asthma (GINA) program. sonicated and centrifuged supernatants were added to HEp-2 cells. cells were grown to 50% confluence in Eagle's minimum essential medium. after two washes with PBS, 200 l of supernatant was added to cell cultures. serum and pg/mg of protein from culture supernatants was determined by ELISA. monocyte cultures from each donor were infected by virus from each infected HEp-2 cell culture supernatants. serum levels of IL-1, TNF-, IL-4, IL-5, MCP-1, and RANTES increased in patients with acute viral respiratory infections. chemokines (MCP-1 and RANTES) had lower levels in bronchitis than in pneumonia. leukin-5 (IL-5), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) expressions in non-asthmatic (NA) and asthmatic (A) patients with viral acute respiratory insufficiency. no significant increased expression of IL-8 was found in human monocyte cultures infected by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PI) or adenovirus (AD). IL-4 was positively correlated with IL-5 expression (r = 04662; P 0001). monocyte cultures infected by ARI were capable of reproducing a similar cytokine and chemokine profiles to those observed in virus-infected patients. chemokine and chemokine receptor inducer effect of RSV on monocyte/macrophage cultures has been reported. serum from RSV-infected patients and monocyte cultures increased levels of IL-1, TNF-, IL-4, IL-5, and RANTES. similar serum cytokine/chemokine levels and viral cytokine inducer effect on monocyte cultures were observed in adenovirus and parainfluencia virus infections. infection with RSV could be a risk factor for further lung diseases. RANTES is involved in the chemoattraction of eosinophils, monocytes, and T-lymphocytes. chemokines could play an important role in asthma pathogenesis. bronchial epithelial damage and cytokine release from airway epithelium are believed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of airway inflammation. in asthma, an infiltration of eosinophils and Th2-cells involving IL-4, 5 and 13 production is usually found. neutrophil chemokine IL-8 and proinflammatory cytokines IL-1 and TNF- play a more prominent role. circulating cytokine profiles showed no differences in expression of proinflammatory and Th2 cytokine profiles. SV-treated monocyte cultures from asthmatic and non-asthmatic patients found similar levels of IL-4 in asthmatic and non-asthmatic patients. previous exposure to RSV can sensitize non-asthmatic airways with further increased cytokine response."}
