{"summary": "TEXT Feline coronaviruses (FCoVs) are members of the Alphacoronavirus genus. they are widespread in the cat population, with seropositivity of up to 90% (13, 19), are horizontally transmitted via the fecal-oral route, and can cause persistent infection (1, 2, 7, 9, 10, 19). despite this genetic difference, both serotypes can be differentiated into two biotypes. recombinant FCoVs generated from cloned full-length cDNA are desirable because they permit the generation of well-defined virus stocks which originate from a cloned sequence after a few passages in cell culture. recombinant FCoVs generated from cloned full-length cDNA are desirable because they permit the generation of well-defined virus stocks which originate from a cloned sequence. chimeric type I/type II FCoV, recFCoV-1b-3abcII, possessing a genome organization similar to that of natural type II FCoVs. ORFs derived from type I FCoV strain black are shown as white boxes, and ORFs derived from type II FCoV strain 79-1146 are shown as black boxes. the stop codon in the type II FCoV strain 79-1146-derived ORF 3c is indicated by an asterisk. all recombinant FCoVs were successfully rescued after electroporation of full-length in vitro-transcribed RNA into BHK-FCoV-N cells (25) the recombinant virus recFCoV-Stop-7b displayed growth kinetics indistinguishable from those of the recombinant type I FC type I FCoV strain black, recFCoV, and recFCoV-Stop-7b (A) and recFCoV-Stop-7b (A) and recFCoV-S-3abcII, recFCoV-1b-3abcII, recFCoV-II, and the type II FCoV strain 79-1146 (B) 96T (TrpCys) 1a-nsp2 A A4682G (IleVal) 1a-nsp3 A A7544C (SerArg) 1a-nsp3 C C7933T (silent) 1a-nsp4 G G9943C (silent) G9943C (silent) G9943C (silent) 1a-nsp6 G G13089C (MetIle FCoV strain 79-1146 sequence is in GenBank under accession number NC_002306. this sequence corresponds to the type II FCoV strain 79-1146 determined in our laboratory. groups of two FCoV-seronegative, specific-pathogen-free cats at an age of 4 to 5 months were inoculated intraperitoneally. type of the chimeric FCoVs suggests that the type-II-derived sequences are not sufficient to increase pathogenicity. the remaining sequences derived from type I FCoV strain black (cat 1 and cat 2) may contain attenuating cell culture adaptations. the animals showed high antibody titers, anorexia, loss of appetite and weight, conjunctivitis, and anemia. in both groups, one cat had to be euthanized at 7 weeks p.i. when clinical manifestation of FIP became apparent. characteristic signs of FIP could also be detected in cats 12 and 14. onymous nucleotide changes in RNA isolated from the spleen and 7 nonsynonymous and 3 silent changes in RNA from kidney suggest that in vivo, recFCoV-II further diversified in the kidneys. this suggests that in vivo, recFCoV-II further diversified in the kidneys. FCoV reverse genetics will contribute to furthering our knowledge on the molecular biology and pathogenesis of FIP."}
