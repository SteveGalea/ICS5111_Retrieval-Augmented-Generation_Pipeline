{"summary": "class I and II fusion proteins are located at or near the amino terminus. fusion peptides of class II fusion proteins are internal. the overall structures of these two classes of viral fusions proteins are also distinct. TBEV E, DEN E and SFV E1 undergo similar conformational changes upon exposure to low pH. it is likely that E1 of other Alphaviruses and E of other members of the flavivirus genus within the family Flaviviridae are also class II fusion proteins. the Bunyaviridae family includes five disparate genus. Bunyavirus Gc and similar proteins of Tenuiviruses and a group of Caenorhabditis elegans retroviruses are class II viral fusion proteins (-penetrenes) phleboviruses were compared to sequences encoded in Alphavirus subgenomic RNA. ine encephalitis virus, strain McMillan (WEE, AAF60166), strain GULU (ONN, P22056), Mayaro virus, strain TRVL4675 (MAY, AA033335), Barmah Forest virus, strain BH2193 (BFV, AA033347) and Ross River virus, strain NB5092 (RRV, NP740686). comparisons were also made with proteins encoded by RNA2 of the H PRSS3 is part of the FASTA package of sequence analysis programs available by anonymous ftp from ftp.virginia.edu. Default settings for PRSS3 were used, including the blosum50 scoring matrix, gap opening penalty of 12 and gap extension penalty of 2. c/ was used to predict mucin type GalNAc O-glycosylation sites. a 3D model of SFV E1 was extrapolated to SIN E1 and SAN GC. Bunyavirus M sequences were compared to sequences encoded in Alphavirus subgenomic RNA. comparisons were made with proteins encoded by RNA2 of the HZ isolate of rice stripe virus, a Tenuivirus (pvc2, AA031607) and with certain retroviruses of Caenorhabditis elegans. the prototype hepaciviruses, strain H (subtype 1a) of hepatitis C virus (HCV, P27958), dengue virus type 2, strain PR-159/S1 (DEB, P12823), PRSS3 is part of the FASTA package of sequence analysis programs available by anonymous ftp from ftp.virginia.edu. Default settings for PRSS3 were used, including the blosum50 scoring matrix, gap opening penalty of 12 and gap extension penalty of 2. CHEM Consortium was used to render a 3D model of SFV E1. similar sequences or common structural/functional motifs are located collinearly in the carboxyl terminal glycoprotein of Sandfly fever virus and Sindbis virus envelope glycoprotein E1. earlier, Gallaher and coworkers modeled the structure of the retroviral transmembrane glycoprotein (TM) [2] onto the scaffold of the known structure of the HA2 portion of the influenza virus hemag phleboviruses Rift Valley fever virus (RVF), Uukuniemi virus (UUK) and Punta Toro virus (PTV) showed significant sequence similarities to certain Alphavirus E1 proteins. the alignment of RVF Gc with SIN E1 and WEE E1 was statistically significant. the alignment was significant (P 0.0002) between aa 889\u2013928 of SAN Gc and aa 833\u2013873 of SIN E1. the next significant sequence similarity, aa 1022\u20131101 of SAN Gc. aa 946\u20131029 of SIN E1 (p 0.03) includes the SIN E1 sequence from sheet Fo in domain Ib to sheet i in domain IIb. the third region of similarity, SAN Gc aa 1181\u20131287 and aa 1112\u20131202 (p 0.003), includes most of SIN E1 domain III. algorithm d assigns a significant score of 3048 (>500 is statistically significant) to aa 1303\u20131322 of SAN Gc. proposed alignment between SAN Gc and SIN E1 necessitates only one \"insertion\" SAN Gc has two sequences with significant WWIHS scores in this region, the pre-anchor and the putative transmembrane domain. the proposed fusion peptide in SAN Gc consists of a sequence with a significant WWIHS score. SAN GC with significant WWIHS scores overlap in proposed alignment with sequences with significant WWIHS in SIN E1. a similar post-fusion structure was found in two other class II fusion proteins, E of DEN and TBEV. the proposed SAN Gc structure conforms closely to the structural predictions of PHDsec [23], Chou-Fasman [21] and Robson-Garnier [22] analyses. ambiguous structures in SAN Gc are depicted as in SIN E1. the cysteine residues are usually the most conserved aa in within a protein family. a plausible three-dimensional model of SAN Gc can be constructed. this result coupled with predictions of a predominantly sheet secondary structure of SAN Gc provides further support its proposed alignment with SIN E1. sequence/structural features suggest that a class II fusion protein structure is conserved in members of the Bunyaviridae. the most significant alignment detected among members of different genuses of the Bunyaviridae was between RVF, type member of phleboviruses, and tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), type member of tospoviruses. orthobunyavirus Gc also show a significant similarity to tospovirus Gc, with Bunyamwera virus (BUN) Gc showing a significant similarity to TSWV Gc. two-way comparisons were done between the full-length amino acid sequences of the indicated glycoproteins. probabilities (p values) of a significant alignment are based on 1000 shuffles. fusion peptides and transmembrane domains of each of the Bunyavirus Gc examined displayed significant WWIHS scores. motifs involved in virion:cell fusion are conserved in Gc throughout the Bunyaviridae. phlebovirus Gc have a significant similarity to surface protein pvc2 encoded by plant viruses of the Tenuiviridae. the PRSS3 sequence alignment algorithm confirms this similarity. the results further validate the use of the PRSS3 algorithm to identify limited similarities between viral proteins. mRNAs transcribed from Bunyavirus M segments are translated into large polyproteins that are cleaved into functional proteins. mRNAs transcribed from each of the five Bunyavirus genuses are the carboxyl terminal proteins of the polyprotein. the most significant alignment was between the Gn proteins of HAN and a hantavirus. similarities in protein order and functions support the hypothesis that Gc is the fusion protein of Bunyaviruses. these results also support the suggested nomenclature of Gn and Gc for the Bunyavirus M segment encoded glycoproteins as a replacement for the current ambiguous nomenclature.

NSm of the RVF and BUN, type members of phlebovirus and orthobunyaviruses, and the \"NSm\" protein of CCHF have short regions of similarity with each other. there were also short regions of similarity between the NSm proteins of these three Bunyavirus genuses and the prM/M-like proteins of Flaviviruses. fusion peptides of all class I and II viral fusion proteins examined to date overlap sequences with significant WWIHS scores. the proposed fusion peptide in SAN Gc consists of a sequence with a significant WWIHS score, which further supports the assignment of this sequence as the fusion peptide. a model of SAN Gc was scaffolded on a presumed structural intermediate of SIN E1 in which domain III is displaced closer to the fusion peptide. the collinear sequence alignments between SAN Gc and SIN E1 suggest a similar domain structure. the proposed SAN Gc structure conforms closely to the structural predictions of PHDsec [23], Chou-Fasman [21] and Robson-Garnier [22] analyses. ambiguous structures in SAN Gc are depicted as in SIN E1. the cysteine residues are usually the most conserved aa in within a protein family. a plausible three-dimensional model of SAN Gc can be constructed. this result coupled with predictions of a predominantly sheet secondary structure of SAN Gc provides further support its proposed alignment with SIN E1. the proposed alignment suggests that a class II fusion protein structure is conserved in members of the Bunyaviridae. the most significant alignment detected among members of different genuses of the Bunyaviridae, was between RVF, type member of phleboviruses, and tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), type member of tospoviruses. orthobunyavirus Gc also show a significant similarity to tospovirus Gc, with Bunyamwera virus (BUN) Gc showing a significant similarity to TSWV Gc (p 10 c 0.0005 0.01 0.009 10-5 NS NS NS 0.05 NS 0.003 NS Nairo CCHF Gc --- --- 0.05 0.0001 NS NS NS NS Phlebo RVF Gc --- --- --- 10-18 0.04 10-8 0.001 NS Tospo TSWV Gc --- --- --- --- NS NS Alpha SIN E1 --- --- --- --- 0.02 NS some cysteine clusters are present in similar locations along the proteins. further support for the alignment of Bunyavirus Gc is obtained by the use of the WWIHS. orthobunyaviruses and tospoviruses Gc have extended regions of approximately 400 and 50 amino acids. phlebovirus Gc have a significant similarity to surface protein pvc2 encoded by plant viruses of the Tenuiviridae. the PRSS3 sequence alignment algorithm confirms this similarity. the results further validate the use of the PRSS3 algorithm. mRNAs transcribed from Bunyavirus M segments are translated into large polyproteins. Gc of members of each of the five Bunyavirus genuses are the carboxyl terminal proteins. most significant alignment was between the Gn proteins of HAN, a hantavirus, and CCHF, a nairovirus. similarity between proteins encoded by a Tenuivirus extends to another glycoprotein of a virus with a class II fusion protein. similarity between proteins encoded by a Tenuivirus also showed limited similarity to SIN E2. phlebovirus encodes nonstructural proteins (NSm) that have two or three potential transmembrane spanning domains as detected by TMpred. phlebovirus encodes nonstructural proteins (NSm) that have two or three potential transmembrane spanning domains as detected by TMpred. RVF and BUN, type members of phlebovirus and orthobunyaviruses, have short regions of similarity with each other. there were also short regions of similarity between the NSm proteins of these three Bunyavirus genuses and the prM/M-like proteins of Flaviviruses. it is possible that the phlebovirus, orthobunyavirus and nairovirus M segment encoded nonstructural proteins serve the same coding sequences of Bunyavirus M appear to have evolved in a manner preserving the order of the glycoproteins Gn and Gc. similar sequences or common structural/functional motifs are collinearly located in Bunyavirus Gc and Alphavirus E1. features common to other class II fusion proteins are conserved and in similar locations in Gc of viruses in each genus of the Bunyaviridae. alphaviruses encode class II viral fusion proteins, according to current analyses. hepaciviruses and pestiviruses encode variant class II fusion proteins. encoding viruses represent substantial portion of enveloped RNA virus families known to infect vertebrates. phlebovirus Gc and SIN E1 are in analogous locations in the polyproteins encoded by the five genuses of the Bunyaviridae. the simplest Bunyavirus M polyprotein encodes only Gn and Gc, whereas M of members of other Bunyavirus genuses encode several additional proteins. however, divergence of Bunyavirus M segments may have occurred either through acquisition of sequences and/or lose of sequences in viviruses may be taken up in an endocytic vesicle following binding to the cellular receptor. exposure to acidic pH in the endosome may trigger conformational changes in the envelope proteins. current models suggest a rearrangement of the stem (pre-anchor region) results in deformation of the viral and target membranes. the entry process of Bunyaviruses can be extrapolated from current models of viral fusion protein-mediated virion cell fusion. Gn is depicted as the receptor-binding protein of Bunyaviruses. some Bunyaviruses may encode other membrane-associated proteins that interact with the fusion peptide. fusion models do not consider that the transmembrane domain and fusion peptide would still be free to move laterally without distorting the membranes. the virion is quite small compared to the cell, and would be freely mobile. similar nearly contiguous sequences with significant WWIHS scores are present in post-fusion intermediates of Alphaviruses SIN and SFV. several potent HIV-1 TM inhibitors were developed [56,57] based on the Gallaher HIV-1 TM fusion protein model. peptides targeted to membrane interactive motifs block fusion mediated by DEN and West Nile virus."}
