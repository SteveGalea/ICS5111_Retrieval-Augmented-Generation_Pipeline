{"summary": "the study monitored MERS-CoV\u2013specific antibody levels in 11 pairs of camel dams and their calves at monthly intervals over the course of 1 year postparturition. the total number of camels on the farm was 4,500. the entire farm is 1 epidemiologic unit. samples were collected from 5 of 11 dam\u2013calf pairs studied. high levels of MERS-CoV\u2013specific antibodies were observed in all dams. no antibodies were detected in calves at day 7 postparturition. ELISA ratios for selected time points are shown in parallel as a boxplot diagram. box represents 50% of the complete dataset from the first to the third quartile, and whiskers are drawn according to the Tukey method. the calf was euthanized for an unrelated condition. a dam\u2013calf pair was excluded after month 6 because the calf was euthanized for an unrelated condition. the greatest risk should be assumed for the time after the fourth month of life until the first wave of natural infections. no human infections occurred among staff and only 2 of 300 workers with regular contact with camels had detectable MERS-CoV\u2013specific IgG antibodies."}
