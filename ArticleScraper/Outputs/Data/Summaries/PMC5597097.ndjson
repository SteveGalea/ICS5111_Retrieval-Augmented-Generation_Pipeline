{"summary": "a new area of research has focused on identifying etiologies of non-malaria, acute febrile illness (AFI). knowledge is limited in large part because AFIs often have similar non-specific clinical presentations early in the clinical course. rapid point-of-care diagnostics are often not readily available. two studies enrolled based on a potential participant meeting national eligibility criteria for malaria testing [12, 13], and two other studies excluded cases based on malaria blood smear positivity [14, 15]. we conducted this study in southern Puerto Rico, where malaria was eradicated in 1962 [19] and dengue has been endemic since the late 1960s [20]. participants discharged to home after enrollment were asked to return 7\u201310 days post-illness onset (DPO) written informed consent was obtained from non-emancipated minors 14\u201320 years old and written informed consent was obtained from the parents or guardians. urine (15 mL), nasopharyngeal (NP), oropharyngeal (OP) specimens collected at enrollment. NP and OP specimens were placed in a vial containing viral transport medium. RNA was extracted from NP and OP specimens and tested for ORV and FLU A/B viral genome. specimens collected 6 DPO were tested by CHIKV-specific real-time RT-PCR [28]. serum specimens collected 3 DPO were tested in the Picornavirus Laboratory by a pan-enterovirus real-time RT-PCR assay. positive specimens were sequenced. a laboratory-positive dengue case had no anti-DENV IgM detected in a single specimen. a laboratory-negative dengue case had no anti-DENV IgM detected in serum collected 6 DPO. a laboratory-positive influenza case was defined by presence of FLU A/B nucleic acid in a NP or OP specimen. clinical definitions Leukopenia was defined as a white blood cell count 5,000 cells/L. moderate hemoconcentration was defined by a hematocrit >97.5th percentile for age and sex to less than the cut-off for severe hemoconcentration. multiple imputation was used to predict an independent plausible value for missing values using generalized linear regression on non-missing variables to create 40 imputed data sets. variables retained at least once in the 40 models were included in a pooled logistic regression model. a physician examined the participants and recorded the clinical diagnosis on the CRF. participants discharged to home after enrollment were asked to return 7\u201310 days post-illness onset. written informed consent was obtained from non-emancipated minors 14\u201320 years old. specimens collected 6 DPO were tested by DENV-serotype specific rRT-PCR. those collected 4 DPO were tested by anti-CHIKV MAC-ELISA. serum specimens collected 3 DPO were tested in the Picornavirus Laboratory by a pan-enterovirus real-time RT-PCR assay that targets the VP1 region. positive specimens were sequenced. a laboratory-positive influenza case was defined by presence of FLU nucleic acid in a NP or OP specimen. a laboratory-positive leptospirosis case was defined by 4-fold increase in MAT titers in paired specimens. a laboratory-positive melioidosis case was defined by presence of burkholderia pseudomallei nucleic acid in paired specimens. clinical definitions Leukopenia was defined as a white blood cell count 5,000 cells/L. moderate hemoconcentration was defined by a hematocrit >97.5th percentile for age and sex to less than the cut-off for severe hemoconcentration. a skin bleed was defined by presence of skin bruising and/or petechiae. variables retained at least once in the 40 models were included in a pooled logistic regression model [34] During the study, sites recorded 234,221 ED visits of which 43,567 (18.6%) patients had fever or reported fever. 1,043 (10.4%) of those enrolled withdrew from the study or were withdrawn. participant Characteristics Overall (n = 8,996) First Year (n = 2,278) Third Year (n = 3,608) Median Range Median Range Age 12.8 0.0\u2013103.3 13.9 * 0.0\u201398.0 10.3 * 0.0\u2013103.3 14.1 0.0\u201397.3 N % n % n % Age group (years) 1 735 8.2 152 6.7 * 291 9.4 * 292 8.1 1\u20134 1,984 22.1 424 18.6 * 93 4.4 136 6.0 * 117 3.8 * 140 3.9 Diabetes 677 7.5 220 9.7 * 187 6.0 * 270 7.5 High blood pressure 963 10.7 273 12.0 * 257 8.3 * 433 12.0 High cholesterol 426 4.7 148 6.5 * 106 3.4 * 172 4.8 Immunodeficiency 75 0.8 23 1.0 35 1.1 17 0.5 Kidney disease 114 1.3 35 1.5 35 1.1 17 0.5 Kidney disease medians Participant characteristics Most (71.8%) participants were enrolled 3 DPO (median DPO at enrollment = 1, range: 0\u20138 days) the timing of presentation did not differ by sex but by age, with a higher proportion of child participants (i.e., 20 years old) presenting 3 DPO than adult participants (74.9% child vs. 68.2% adult females, p 0.001;

RT-PCR positive deNV/CHIKV co-infections have been documented at higher rates in five countries. we found that even early (3 DPO) in the clinical course leukopenia and thrombocytopenia are predictive of dengue across all age groups, and thrombocytopenia strengthened as a predictor. dengue cases of all ages presenting 3\u20135 DPO were also more likely to have diarrhea and poor circulation. findings lend support to the idea that warning signs for severe dengue develop after the early phase of the illness. study enrolled all patients presenting with fever regardless of age, sex or clinical characteristics. the presence of leukopenia and thrombocytopenia were the best predictors of dengue in both time periods overall and for all age groups. the presence of leukopenia and thrombocytopenia were the best predictors of dengue in both time periods overall and for all age groups."}
