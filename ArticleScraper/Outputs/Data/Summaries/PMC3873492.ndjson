RNA products were purified over a G-50 column, precipitated with ethanol, and resuspended in 10 mmol/L Tris and 1 mmol/L EDTA, pH 7.4 (T10E1) the resulting suspensions were assayed for RNA concentration, and the length of each synthetic RNA was confirmed by 1.5% formaldehyde denaturation gel electrophoresis. prehybridization solution was composed of 50% formamide, 2 SSC, 1 g/mL of salmon sperm DNA, 1 g/mL of yeast tRNA, and 2 mmol/L vanadyl ribonucleoside complex. after hybridization, the slides were washed three times with solution 1 (50% formamide and 2 SSC at pH 7.4) for 20 minutes at 50\u00b0C. images were captured using an A2 upright microscope. titer of H5N1 HPAIV increased approximately 200-fold over the first 6 days after infection. titer in lung tissue decreased until the last detection on 7 days after infection. bronchial epithelium, alveoli, and vascular endothelium were evaluated at different levels of the lower respiratory tract after infection with H5N1 HPAIV (C) or with H1N1 pdm 2009 virus (D). bronchial epithelium, alveoli, and vascular endothelium were evaluated at different levels of the lower respiratory tract. NP antigen was detected in bronchial epithelial cells, type II pneumocytes, macrophages, vascular endothelium, and perivascular lymphocytes. expression of NP antigen exhibited a time-dependent expansion to the alveoli and vascular endothelium. expression in the bronchus gradually faded from day 3 to day 9 after infection. in mice infected with H1N1 pdm 2009 virus, NP antigen was detected predominantly in epithelial cells of the bronchus and bronchiole. levels of NP antigen in endothelial cells, vascular and perivascular lymphocytes (Figure 2, C and D) remained low compared with levels of NP antigen seen in mice infected with H5N1 HPAIV. a: Temporal changes of IHC staining for H5N1-HA protein in the lungs of mice infected with H5N1 HPAIV. each column indicates days 1 to 9 after infection. representative figures at each time point (four mice per time point) are shown. either the HA- or NP-encoding genes stained the nuclei of MDCK cells infected with either H5N1 virus or H1N1 pdm 2009 virus. vRNA and mRNA of H5N1 HPAIV were detected in bronchial epithelial cells, type II pneumocytes and vascular endothelial cells. double immunostaining was performed for PCNA and alveolar macrophage-specific marker (Iba1) in mice infected with influenza A/H1N1 pdm 2009 virus. cells stained positive for both PCNA and a macrophage-specific marker (Iba1) may be newly proliferating macrophages or may be derived from infiltrating monocytes. proliferating alveolar macrophages (PCNA+/Iba1+); black arrowheads, resident alveolar macrophages (PCNA/Iba1+) were counted in 10 randomly selected microscopic fields of individual animals. mean IHC scores were approximately 3.0 (common positive cells) and 1.0 at 6 and 9 days after infection. proliferation of type II pneumocytes increased through 9 days after infection with H1N1 pdm 2009 virus. proliferation of type II pneumocytes progressively increased through 9 days after infection with H1N1 pdm 2009 virus. expression levels of several proinflammatory cytokines were significantly higher in the lung of H5N1 HPAIV-infected mice. IL-6 and IFN- were significantly induced from 1 day after H5N1 HPAIV infection. macrophage-stimulating factors, including MCP-1, MIP-1, and G-CSF, increased 6 to 9 days after H5N1 HPAIV infection. titer of H5N1 HPAIV increased approximately 200-fold over the first 6 days after infection, before subsequently decreasing until the last detection on 7 days after infection. despite the higher infecting titer used with H1N1 pdm 2009 virus (2 106 PFUs) compared with H5N1 HPAIV. lungs obtained from mice infected with influenza H5N1 HPAIV (E) and pandemic H1N1 virus (F) Scoring of lung histological characteristics was done in three to four mice from each group at each time point. data are expressed as means SD. ND, not detected. expression of NP antigen exhibited a time-dependent expansion to the alveoli and vascular endothelium. expression in the bronchus gradually faded from day 3 to day 9 after infection. perivascular lymphocytes (Figure 2, C and D), and alveoli (Figure 2, C and D) remained low compared with the levels of NP antigen seen in mice infected with H5N1 HPAIV. antigen detection showed limited induction in the alveoli (Figure 2, C and D), in contrast to the pattern seen in mice infected with H5N1 HPAIV. bronchus, bronchiole, alveoli, epithelial cells of lower respiratory tract, and vascular endothelium. numbers of HA-positive cells were evaluated using the IHC scoring system. vRNA and mRNA of H1N1 pdm 2009 virus were detected in bronchial epithelial cells, type II pneumocytes, and vascular endothelial cells. both H5N1 viral transcripts were detected, at lower levels, in macrophages. the vRNA and mRNA of H1N1 pdm 2009 virus were not detected in the lung at 9 days after infection. in mice infected with H5N1 HPAIV, images of dual-stained lung tissue revealed extensive proliferation of the macrophages. this proliferation was confirmed by IHC scoring, achieving a mean IHC score of 4.0 (extensive positive cells) by day 9 after infection. proliferation index, defined as the number of proliferating macrophages (PCNA+/Iba1+) expressed as a percentage of total macrophage (Iba1+) numbers. results were performed in three to four mice per time point. data are shown as means SD. ND, not detected. the proliferation of type II pneumocytes after infection with H5N1 HPAIV (A and B) or H1N1 pdm 2009 (C and D) was estimated. double immunostaining was performed for PCNA and SP-C. IL-6 and IFN- were significantly induced from 1 day after H5N1 HPAIV infection. macrophage-stimulating factors, including MCP-1, MIP-1, and G-CSF, increased 6 to 9 days after infection. in mice infected with H1N1 pdm 2009 virus, the viral titers in lung tissue gradually decreased over time. however, many kinds of cells (eg, vascular endothelial cells, pneumocytes, some macrophages, and epithelial cells) were infected with H5N1 HPAIV. avian influenza24 viruses are known to induce DAD in humans. virus NP protein was detected at low levels in mice infected with pdm 2009 virus. the envelope contains two large surface-exposed glycoproteins: HA and neuraminidase. the latter is responsible for attachment and penetration of virus into host cells. paired serial sections of lung tissue revealed the presence of NP and H5N1-HA in overlapping regions of the lung. we speculate that histochemical staining for H5N1-HA will provide greater sensitivity than for NP. cytopathic destruction is expected to lead to alveolar damage. a massive infiltration of macrophages has been observed in the lungs of H5N1-infected humans and mice. influenza infection of macrophages stimulates production and release of proinflammatory cytokines. the direct viral injury to type II pneumocytes may impair these cells\u2019 functions, including re-epithelialization after alveolar damage. excessive accumulation of macrophages in the lungs could contribute to tissue damage by causing vascular injury and destruction of the parenchymal cells."}
