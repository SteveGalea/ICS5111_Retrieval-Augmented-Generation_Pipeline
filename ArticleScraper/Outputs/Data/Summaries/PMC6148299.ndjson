{"summary": "mice were excluded from the studies when adverse events occurred. PBOO mice were divided into two subgroups: PBOO + P (placebo) and PBOO + T (treatment), receiving 100 l of either saline or saline. mice received 100 l of saline as same as PBOO + P group. paraformaldehyde-fixed sections (5-m thickness) of the bladders from each group were used. sections from at least three animals in each group were analyzed for reproducibility. 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 23.8 NaHCO3, 0.5 MgCl2, 0.4 NaH2PO4, 1.8 CaCl2 and 5.5 glucose. one end of the strip was secured to a glass rod at the bottom of the organ chamber. each muscle strip was allowed to equilibrate a further 30 min in fresh Tyrode\u2019s buffer. each strip was thoroughly washed after all contractile recordings to EFS, CCh, and KCl and equilibrated for 45 min in fresh Tyrode\u2019s solution. 15 min of spontaneous contractions under steady state were sampled. tone was defined as the mean spontaneous rhythmic contractile force produced by the bladder strips. mice were individually placed on a steel wire mesh (0.64-cm2 opening) floor. each mouse had free access to water but no food during 3-h test period. urine spots on the filter paper were imaged using ultraviolet light on a transilluminator. the catheter was tunneled subcutaneously and exteriorized at the scapula region. it was filled with sterile saline after confirming no leakage at the bladder. animals were transferred to individual cages after the recovery from anesthesia. all data were analyzed using one-way repeated-measures ANOVA among three groups using GraphPad InStat (GraphPad Software), la Jolla, CA. differences those showed significance by ANOVA tests were analyzed by the Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons test. PBOO mice were divided into two subgroups: PBOO + P (placebo) and PBOO + T (treatment), receiving 100 l of either saline (vehicle) or 17-DMAG (treatment), by intraperitoneal injection every 48 h from 1 to 13 days postsurgery. qRT-PCR was performed using a light cycler 480. expression levels of each gene were calculated as fold changes. data were normalized to 18S rRNA. saline (3 mg/ml) was added to the organ bath at 1,000 dilution (final concentration of 3 mg/l) in Tyrode\u2019s solution. sham and PBOO + P (N = 3, n = 3 per group) were tested the responses to EFS, CCh, and KCl. each strip was thoroughly washed after all contractile recordings to EFS, CCh, and KCl. the bladder strips were treated with each concentration of PDBu for 15 min or either BIM-1 or Y-27632 for 30 min. the last 15-min interval within each observation period was used to analyze spontaneous contractions. changes in amplitude and frequency were expressed as percent changes before and after the administration of test compounds. a subset of mice underwent surgical catheter implantation in the bladder. a flared-end polyethylene catheter (PE-10) was inserted through a puncture on the bladder dome and secured with a 7\u20130 Prolene suture (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ) the catheter was tunneled subcutaneously and exteriorized at the scapula region. ded urine was monitored with the analytical balance connected to a force displacement transducer integrated into the data acquisition system. each animal was observed for up to six to eight voiding cycles. urodynamic values recorded continuously during testing. a 1-Fr silicon tubing was placed next to the urethra. a 5\u20130 silk suture was passed behind vesicourethral junction. the suture was tied snugly around the tubing with the urethra. all animals received a single dose of carprofen (5 mg/kg) subcutaneously. RNA was expressed as a proportion of collagen level as collagen-to-total and collagen-to-DSM. cells were equilibrated for 45 min and stretched to their optimum length for muscle contraction. detrusor muscle contractility was examined as the responses to a series of EFS (70 V, 0.5\u201332 Hz), the acetylcholine receptor agonist carbachol (CCh; 0.1\u2013100 M), and high KCl solution. each muscle strip was thoroughly washed after all contractile recordings to EFS, CCh, and KCl and equilibrated for 45 min in fresh Tyrode\u2019s buffer. the bladder strips were treated with each concentration of PDBu for 15 min or either BIM-1 or Y-27632 for 30 min. the last 15-min interval within each observation period was used to analyze spontaneous contractions. void spot assays were conducted at 3, 7 and 14 days after the surgery. urine spots of 0.1 cm2 (corresponding to 3 l of urine) were excluded from analysis as previously described (47) the number of large (50 l) and small (50 l) micturition spots on the filter paper was counted. the tip of the exteriorized bladder catheter located at the base of the mouse neck was connected to a pressure transducer. room temperature saline solution (0.9% NaCl) was infused into the bladder at a rate of 10 l/min. each animal was observed for up to six to eight voiding cycles. PBOO caused a significant increase in bladder weight in comparison with control group. 17-DMAG treatment alleviated the bladder enlargement by 34%. sham control, partial bladder outlet obstruction (PBOO) + placebo (P; middle), or PBOO + treatment (T) groups at 2 wk postsurgery. Enhanced collagen deposition (red) was observed in mucosa. the bladders from the PBOO + T mice appeared comparable with those from controls. all of these genes have been reported to play a role in bladder pathogenesis following PBOO (12, 21, 22) treatment with 17-DMAG decreased the degree of PBOO-induced upregulation of HIF target genes by 25 to 77%, supporting that an inhibitory effect of 17-DMAG on HIF transcriptional activity. 17-DMAG treatment improved basal detrusor overactivity in the obstructed bladders. the amplitude of the spontaneous contractions was approximately twofold larger in PBOO + P mice compared with other groups. detrusor smooth muscle (DSM) strips from control, PBOO + P, and PBOO + T groups showed a significant increase in the frequency compared with control mice. both PBOO groups showed a significant increase in the frequency compared with those in control group. PBOO + T showed a minimal decrease in the tone with PDBu at 1\u201310 nM. PDBu induced a steady increase in the amplitude of spontaneous contractions. there was no significant difference between the groups. tude nor frequency of spontaneous contractions showed significant difference between groups and between without drug and Y-27632 or bisindolylmaleimide-I (BIM-1) within each group. changes in amplitude (middle) and frequency are depicted as the percentage to the value without drug (taken as 100%) values are means SE. *P 0.05 vs. control group. PBOO + P mice showed the maximum intravesical pressure at voiding of 12.8 0.5 mmHg with the micturition interval of 10.3 1.1 min and the bladder capacity of 112 11 l. PBOO + P mice showed the maximum intravesical pressure at voiding of 12.8 0.5 mmHg with the micturition interval of 10.3 1.1 min. the micturition interval, voided volume, and the functional bladder capacity regarded as the infused volume at each cycle were decreased by approximately 20 and 10% in PBOO + P and PBOO + T groups. in PBOO mice, approximately 33 and 15% of a micturition cycle were separated in two parts of void in placebo and 17-DMAG treatment groups. volume infused (VI; top), bladder pressure (BP; middle), and voided volume (VV; bottom) indicate examples of nonvoiding bladder contractions. 17-DMAG treatment alleviated an increase in bladder weight and fibrosis induced by PBOO. the 17-DMAG regimen used in this study alleviated the fibrosis in the obstructed bladders. Table 1. Comparison of body and bladder weight Group Control PBOO + P PBOO + T. PBOO caused a significant increase in collagen level. 17-DMAG treatment suppressed the collagen deposition in the obstructed bladders. 17-DMAG treatment preserved detrusor contractility in the obstructed bladders. the bladder strips from PBOO + P showed a significant decrease in detrusor contractility in response to all stimuli. the amplitude of the spontaneous contractions was approximately twofold larger in PBOO + P mice (26 3 mg, P = 0.001) compared with other groups (14 1 in control, 15 1 in PBOO + T groups) the frequency of spontaneous contractions without any stimuli was 1.1 0.1 contractions/min in control group. Y-26732 caused a larger decrease (1.5 to 4.5-fold) in tone than that by BIM-1 in all groups. PDBu induced a biphasic effect on tone in control group and lowered the tone at low concentrations (1\u201310 nM) PBOO + T showed a minimal decrease in the tone with PDBu at 1\u201310 nM. there was no change in the frequency of spontaneous contractions up to 10 nM of PDBu. the frequency was lowered notably in PBOO groups with PDBu compared with that in control mice. but the frequency of the obstructed bladders stayed higher than that in control mice. 0.05, between control and PBOO + P groups; P 0.05, between control and PBOO + T groups. 17-DMAG treatment improved the voiding pattern in PBOO animals. PBOO + P mice showed the maximum intravesical pressure at voiding of 12.8 0.5 mmHg with the micturition interval of 10.3 1.1 min and the bladder capacity of 112 11 l. PBOO + P mice showed the maximum intravesical pressure at voiding of 12.8 0.5 mmHg with the micturition interval of 10.3 1.1 min and the bladder capacity of 112 11 l. urodynamic parameters in each group include % Voiding Pressure, mmHg Nonvoid Contractions Control 617 66 112 11 107 8 99 7 12.8 0.5 0.2 0.1 PBOO + P 460 52 94 11 84 11 85 6 30.1 2.5* 4.3 1.0* PBOO + T groups. 17-DMAG treatment alleviated the fibrosis in the obstructed bladders. no difference in body weight was detected among the groups (n = 20 per group) Enhanced collagen deposition (red) was observed in mucosa. the bladders from the PBOO + P mice appeared comparable with those from controls. PBOO caused a significant increase in collagen level. all of these genes have been reported to play a role in bladder pathogenesis following PBOO (12, 21, 22) treatment with 17-DMAG decreased the degree of PBOO-induced upregulation of HIF target genes by 25 to 77%. 17-DMAG treatment improved basal detrusor overactivity in the obstructed bladders. amplitude of spontaneous contractions was approximately twofold larger in PBOO + P mice compared with other groups. control, PBOO + P, and PBOO + T groups without any stimuli. both groups showed a significant increase in the frequency compared with control mice. PBOO altered the mechanisms of maintenance of detrusor tone. PBOO + T showed a minimal decrease in the tone with PDBu at 1\u201310 nM. PDBu induced a steady increase in the amplitude of spontaneous contractions. there was no significant difference between the groups. changes in amplitude (middle) and frequency are depicted as the percentage to the value without drug (taken as 100%) values are means SE. *P 0.05, between control and PBOO + P groups; P 0.05, between control and PBOO + T groups. mice showed maximum intravesical pressure at voiding of 12.8 0.5 mmHg with micturition interval of 10.3 1.1 min and bladder capacity of 112 11 l. PBOO + P mice showed 2.3-fold higher maximum intravesical pressure. the micturition interval, voided volume, and the functional bladder capacity regarded as the infused volume at each cycle were decreased by approximately 20 and 10% in PBOO + P and PBOO + T groups. in PBOO mice, approximately 33 and 15% of a micturition cycle were separated in two parts of void in placebo and 17-DMAG treatment groups. 0.05, PBOO + P (middle), and PBOO + T (middle) mice were in a continuous intravesical infusion (10 l/min) of room temperature saline. asterisks in the volume of micturition traces indicate the micturition composed of in 2 parts of void. anticholinergics, clean intermittent catheterization, intradetrusor Botulinum toxin injections, overnight drainage, -adren 17-DMAG inhibits the HIF activity by blocking the interaction between HSP90 and HIF-subunits, which is essential for HIF activation. the difference between the PBOO + P and PBOO + T groups was statistically significant (P 0.01). PBOO caused an enlargement of the bladder with enhanced collagen deposition. 17-DMAG alleviated histopathological changes in the obstructed bladders. but a smaller but significant increase in the bladder weight in PBOO + T mice could have resulted from HIF target genes. 17-DMAG treatment partially prevented the development of detrusor overactivity in the obstructed bladders. PBOO causes bladder stiffness, at least partly caused by an impairment of relaxation property in the bladder. previous studies have shown HIFs mediate the formation of stress fibers and myosin light chain phosphorylation through the ROCK pathway and also extracellular matrix contraction (15) inhibition of ROCK by Y-27632 could relieve the inhibition of MLCP and resulted in a larger relaxation of bladder strips in PBOO groups. a sequential activation of individual PKC isozymes during muscle cell spreading has been reported. PBOO activates two major signaling pathways and growth factors. PBOO activates fibroblast leading to differentiation of myofibroblasts. fibroblasts and myofibroblasts secret extracellular matrix (ECM) including collagen and fibronectin. HIFs upregulate ECM-modifying enzymes such as P4hb and Lox. in vitro physiological tests are in good agreement with the phenotype observed in the in vivo examination of bladder function by VSA and cystometry. the lack of DSM relaxation and the detrusor overactivity was manifest as smaller voided volume and frequent small voids in PBOO + P group, indicating that the bladder became hypocompliant with a reduced functional capacity. the same total dose of 17-DMAG (21 mg/kg) for 2 wk (twice longer period of PBOO from our previous study) could preserve bladder function and prevent pathophysiological alterations in the obstructed bladders. limitations for this study are lack of a PBOO model mimicking PUV where the obstruction begins in utero with technical difficulties and the lack of longer follow-up.
