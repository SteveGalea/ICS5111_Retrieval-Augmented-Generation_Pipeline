{"summary": "porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a single-strand enveloped RNA virus like PEDV. the virus caused severe diarrhea in sows and piglets. contaminated livestock trailers represent a significant risk for movement of the virus among herds. accelerated hydrogen peroxide disinfectant is virucidal at dilution rates of 1:16 to 1:64, in the presence of 200 ppm hard water, 5% serum load, and a 5 min contact time. accelerated hydrogen peroxide (AHP) disinfectant is virucidal at dilution rates of 1:16 to 1:64, in the presence of 200 ppm hard water. the coupons were used in a previous study to evaluate the efficacy of different combinations of time and temperature to inactivate PEDV (11) the coupons were modified for this study by drilling 4 holes in each coupon that were 8 mm in diameter at the junction of the bottom of the coupon and 1 side. the null hypothesis was that there was no difference between the positive control group and the treatment groups in the proportion of pigs that were positive for PEDV. 12.5 L of 2 multiplex RT-PCR buffer, 2.5 L of 20 multiplex enzyme, 0.5 L of forward primer at 20 M, 0.5 L of reverse primer at 20 M, 0.12 L of probe at 25 M, 3.88 L of nucleic acid extract. Personnel performing treatments, necropsies, and collecting samples were not blinded to the treatments. a transmission control group (n = 4) was included to validate that the animal housing and handling protocols used for the bioassay did not result in transmission of virus from one pig to another within the same treatment group. the study groups are summarized in Table I. Table I. negative feces were frozen at 80\u00b0C, stored, thawed on day 0 and homogenized into a single fecal homogenate. feces from individual pigs were thawed and pooled into a single fecal homogenate to ensure that the amount of virus and composition of the feces were uniform. feces were spread in a thin ( 2 mm), even layer using a disposable spreader. the disposable spreader was sold in hardware stores to spread adhesive on floors. a separate, new spreader was used for each coupon to avoid cross-contamination between replicates. 3 s per coupon would result in the desired liquid volume of 30 mL of diluted AHP at both concentrations. the coupons were swabbed using the same commercial swab and transport system used to swab them immediately after contamination. liquid mixture of feces, disinfectant, and saline was aspirated using a 20 mL syringe. the syringe was labeled with the identification number of the single pig. the syringe was capped and labeled with the identification number of the single pig to receive the mixture. rectal swabs were collected using a commercially available swab and transport system (Starswabs II) and submitted to the ISU VDL for diagnostic testing. each pig was identified with a unique plastic ear tag (Allflex USA, Dallas, Texas, USA) and weighed. the tubs had solid dividers completely separating each of the 4 pigs from one another. each divided portion of the tub had dedicated water and feed sources. pigs were fed an age-appropriate corn and soybean meal based diet ad libitum. samples of feces from each pig were collected with rectal swabs (Starswabs II) and tested for PEDV by RT-PCR. pigs were not removed from their individual pens to avoid cross-contamination between individuals. study groups Pigs (n = 28) were divided into 7 groups. four treatment groups representing combinations of fecal contamination (5 mL or 10 mL) and disinfectant concentration (1:16 or 1:32) were evaluated. a positive control group (n = 4) and negative control group (n = 4) were included without sham disinfection. feces, 1:16 concentration of AHP disinfectanta 5 mL-1:32 5 mL PEDV-positive feces, 1:32 concentration of AHP disinfectanta Transmission control 1 of 4 pigs in the group was gavaged with 5 mL PEDV-positive feces, no treatment a With 30 min of contact time at 20\u00b0C (room temperature) 5 mL (positive control, negative control, 5 mL-1:16, 5 mL-1:32, transmission control) or 10 mL (10 mL-1:16, 10 mL-1:32, positive control, and 1 of the 4 pigs in the transmission control group. the feces were spread in a thin ( 2 mm), even layer using a disposable spreader. the negative control, positive control, and transmission control groups were not sham disinfected. the AHP disinfectant was applied to all replicates (n = 4) of a treatment group simultaneously. four was the minimum number of replicates required to demonstrate statistical significance. coupons were swabbed using the same commercial swab and transport system. the coupons were then tilted so that the remaining material flowed away from the holes. a new toothbrush, one per coupon, was used to suspend the remaining feces and disinfectant for ease of re-collection. syringe labeled with the pig number of the single pig to be inoculated with the contents from a single coupon. blood was collected using a 12-mL syringe with a 38 mm 18-gauge needle. the serum was then transferred to an 8.5 mL plastic serum separator tube. serum samples were tested for antibodies to PEDV by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and antibodies for TGEV using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) each pig was identified with a unique plastic ear tag (Allflex USA, Dallas, Texas, USA) on arrival, each pig was identified with a unique plastic ear tag. pigs in each group were housed in the same tub, 1 pig per quadrant. personnel wore disposable coveralls and a respirator. personnel wore disposable obstetrical sleeves and nitrile gloves. all animals were humanely euthanized using penetrating captive bolt and necropsied. pigs were negative for PEDV, PDCoV, PRRSV, and TGEV. pre-treatment Ct values for the groups contaminated with PEDV-positive feces were not significantly different (P = 0.07) the highest concentration was 103.61 genomic copies/mL. mL-1:32 and 10 mL-1:32 each had one positive (Ct 35) and one suspect swab collected after 30 min of contact time with the less concentrated AHP for 30 min. the highest concentration was 104.43 genomic copies/mL. only half of the swabs from trays treated with the higher concentration of AHP (5 mL-1:16, 10 mL-1:16, 5 mL-1:32, and 10 mL-1 negative control, positive control, and transmission control groups were not sham disinfected and no \u201cpost-treatment\u201d swabs were collected for these groups. negative control, positive control, and transmission control groups were not sham disinfected. swabs collected from all pigs in the negative control group, the 3 pigs designated as negative (3 of 4) in the transmission control group and all pigs in the 4 treatment groups were negative for PEDV by RT-PCR on days 3 and 7 post-inoculation. no rectal swabs in any group had Ct values within the suspect range (35 Ct 40). the transmission control group was included to validate the animal housing and handling protocols used for the bioassay. each pig was considered positive for the bioassay if the fecal samples from the pig were positive for PEDV by real-time RT-PCR on days 3 and 7. the industry standard for sanitation and decontamination of livestock trailers includes trailer washing, disinfection, and natural drying or TADD systems. scraping livestock trailers to remove as much organic material as possible followed by disinfection with an AHP may be used as an alternative to doing nothing to reduce the risk of PEDV transmission associated with livestock trailers. limits of current viral isolation methods in cell culture make it difficult to culture PEDV outside of an animal model. of the 16 replicates in the 4 treatment groups with AHP (5 mL-1:16, 10 mL-1:16, 5 mL-1:32, and 10 mL-1:32) only 2 had replicates that remained positive (Ct 35) after treatment, but every group had at least 1 suspect (35 Ct 40) swab that remained negative on the bioassay. each treatment group so that the pigs could be inoculated immediately after the inoculum was collected, eliminating the need to attempt to neutralize the AHP disinfectant after the 30-minute contact time. the sidewalls and gates are generally smooth with varying angles that would be represented by the 90\u00b0 angles where the sidewall meets the bottom surface of the coupons. in the tub was inoculated with feces that were positive for PEDV. the other 3 were inoculated with feces that were negative for PEDV. the results suggest the housing model and animal handling procedures were effective at preventing lateral transmission between pigs by direct contact, humans, or aerosol."}
