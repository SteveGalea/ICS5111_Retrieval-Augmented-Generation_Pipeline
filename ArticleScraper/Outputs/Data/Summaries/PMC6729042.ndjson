{"summary": "a DNA-launched rescue system initiates the transcription of viral genomic cDNA from eukaryotic promoter in transfected cells. the current knowledge of the pathogenesis of duck astrovirus type 1 (DAstV-1) is limited. however, there is no report of such a system for DAstV-1. rDAstV-1 and pDAstV-1 shared similar replication kinetics. the virus was capable of invading both the central and the peripheral immune organs in infected ducklings."}
