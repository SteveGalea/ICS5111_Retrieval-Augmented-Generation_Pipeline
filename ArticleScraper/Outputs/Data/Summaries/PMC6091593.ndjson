{"summary": "despite the available research findings, recommendations and the OHSA, there are still challenges with regard to the implementation of selected sections and regulations of the OHSA. this is evidenced by the occupational injuries and illness claims registered with the compensation fund (South Africa, Department of Labour 1993). studies have been conducted in different parts of the world on occupational health and safety in the workplace. in europe, 60% of musculoskeletal problems were reported as the main work-related health problems, followed by 14% of stress, depression and anxiety. in the Philippines, de Castro et al. (2010) found that nurses were in the majority of those suffering occupational-related illnesses. the incidence rates in 2010 were 36%, in 2011, 49% and in 2012, 67% respectively. the report shows that there is an escalation of injuries every year. this is evidenced by the above mentioned report obtained from the hospital Injury on Duty register. the escalating incidence of injuries prompted the researcher to explore the implementation of the following selected sections and regulations of the OHSA (Act 85 of 1993) at an academic hospital in Johannesburg. section 8: General duties of employers to employees; Section 14: General duties of employees at work; Section 17: Health and safety representatives; Section 19: Health and Safety Committee; Regulations on the reporting of incidents and occupational diseases. in south africa, musculoskeletal disorders and respiratory diseases are the most common causes for staying away from work. the implementation of the OHSA aids in ensuring and enhancing better health for all employees in the workplace. de Castro et al. (2009) conducted a study in the Philippines. found that amongst the health professionals, nurses were in the majority of those suffering occupational-related illnesses, with more than 78% experiencing back pain. the reengineering of the health-care system also put South Africa in a better position as compare to its neighbours. study seeks to explore the implementation of the following selected sections and regulations of the OHSA. section 8: General duties of employers to their employees; section 14: General duties of employers at work; section 17: Health and safety representatives; section 19: Appointment Health and Safety Committee. a total of 37 wards (20 specialised units and 17 general wards) were selected to participate in the study based on a high number of incidents reported. two participants did not meet the criteria. data collection Likert-scale ranged from 1 to 5, indicating never, rarely, sometimes, often, and all the time respectively. a total of 140 questionnaires were distributed and the respond rate was 129 (92%) validity measures the degree to which the instrument is doing what it is intended to do to ensure validity of a study. population consists of 178 senior professional nurses, 70 nurse managers, and 37 wards in the academic hospital under study. a purposive sampling method was used to select senior professional nurses and nursing managers who were on duty during the time of data collection. two participants did not meet the criteria. the data collection tool was developed by the researcher derived from the OHSA (Act 85 of 1993) the questionnaire consisted of 2 sections. Section A dealt with the demographic data, while Section B dealt with 4 sections and 4 regulations which consisted of 45 items derived from the OHSA. validity measures the degree to which the instrument is doing what it is intended to do to ensure validity of a study. a total number of 140 questionnaires were distributed and the respond rate was 129 (92%). validity refers to whether the instrument actually measures the accuracy of the concept in question. the total number of participants was 129. of the 127 participants, 126 participants disclosed their qualifications, 74 were senior professional nurses and 52 were nursing managers. 121 participants disclosed their ages whilst 6 participants did not. 126 participants disclosed their qualifications, 74 were senior professional nurses and 52 were nursing managers. 121 participants disclosed their ages whilst 6 participants did not. 49% indicated that emergency exit escape routes were not or rarely free from obstacles. 73% of participants indicated that the housekeeping methods of storage rooms were never or rarely followed. this is non-compliance with the OHSA by both senior professional nurses and nursing managers. the OHSA mandated the use of universal precautions as a form of precautions. universal precautions refer to certain infection-control steps medical professionals take to reduce the risk of transmitting HIV and other infectious diseases. the OHSA states that all hazardous waste should be properly contained and controlled to prevent the spread of contamination in the workplace. the training of workers in occupational health and safety issues has been an important part of improving working conditions. all waste that can cause harm by its exposure should be clearly labelled or colour-coded. the promotion of good hygiene in nursing wards should take place at all times. one of the broad objectives of occupational health programmes in the workplace is to promote, support, and provide a healthy and productive, highly functioning workforce to the employer. the non-availability of the occupational health and safety policy in the nursing wards is an indication that the senior professional nurses and nursing managers do not comply with the implementation of the occupational health and safety measures in their wards. legal obligations compel employers in some jurisdictions to implement practices that ensure workplace equity, health and safety. it is therefore recommended that the employer should provide a safe and healthy working environment to all employees of an academic hospital. this is further supported by Katsuro et al. (2010), who indicate that occupational health and safety statutory instruments state that it is the employer\u2019s obligation to provide a safe working environment. 75% (n = 95) of participants responded that employees never or rarely obey health and safety rules and procedures. this practise behaviour raises a serious of concern as the acts compel every employee to report any unsafe work environment before the end of the shift. it is therefore recommended that all HS representatives should be trained or workshop on their responsibilities as stipulated in the OHSA. 61% (n = 77) of the participants showed that the HS Committee members never or rarely function as required by the OHSA. 65% (n = 81) revealed that the HS Committee members never identify and address shortfalls in order to prevent their recurrence. if an employee sustains an injury as a result of an incident which arose from related duties. the employer is compelled to report any incidents and occupational diseases within the stipulated time frames as required by the OHSA. if the employer does not adhere to the acts, they will be fined or may even face imprisonment. the purpose of the investigation is not to find fault, but rather to find facts in order to prevent further occurrences. it is therefore recommended that employees report any incident at the workplace to their supervisors or occupational HS representatives. the employer should investigate as required by the OHSA and eliminates the risks. Keeping records for 40 years will aid the hospital in producing them in times of litigations. failure to produce these documents will put the hospital management in a negative light before the law without a proof. it is recommended that the employer should keep all medical surveillance records for a period of 40 years. study on employers\u2019 awareness and compliance with occupational health and safety regulations in Taiwan. 73% (n = 90) indicated that the housekeeping methods of storage rooms were never or rarely maintained or implemented. this is non-compliance with the OHSA by both senior professional nurses and nursing managers. health-care workers are at risk of occupational exposure and transmission of viruses, including the hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and HIV. it is vital for health-care workers to practice procedures on the clean-up of blood and any other spilled fluids when in contact with body fluids. the OHSA mandated the use of universal precautions as a form of infection control in the early 1990s. all hazardous waste must be properly contained and controlled to prevent the spread of contamination in the workplace. all hazardous waste must be properly labelled and always attached to primary waste containers. sub-theme 1.5: measures practised for promotion of good hygiene in the ward A majority of the participants indicated that the promotion of good hygiene in the nursing ward was never or rarely practised. it is recommended that the promotion of good hygiene in the nursing wards should take place at all times. more than half of participants indicated that there was no or rarely written policy on health and safety in the ward. 90% (n = 114) revealed that a policy on occupational health and safety was not or rarely displayed in the nursing wards. legal obligations compel employers in some jurisdictions to implement practices that ensure workplace equity, health and safety. t 82% of participants responded that their employer never raised awareness of measures to ensure compliance with the OHSA in the hospital environment. it is therefore recommended that the employer should provide a safe and healthy working environment to all employees of an academic hospital. 49% (n = 62) of the participants indicated that emergency exit escape routes were not or rarely free from obstacles. according to the OHSA, the escape routes leading to emergency exits should always be free of any obstacles. this is supported by Koesterich (2011), who conducted a study on a veterinary teaching hospital in the us. health-care workers make up only 0.6% of the global population. health-care workers are at high risk of preventable infections from blood-borne pathogens. health-care workers are at high risk of occupational exposure. a majority of the participants indicated that waste disposal methods were never followed. 77% (n = 98) of the participants indicated that waste was not or rarely separated correctly, with clearly labelled packaging. universal precautions refer to certain infection-control steps medical professionals take to reduce the risk of transmitting HIV and other infectious diseases. all hazardous waste should be properly contained and controlled to prevent spread of contamination in the workplace. alli (2008) argues that employers should ensure that all waste that can cause harm by its exposure is disposed of at a marked, designated area, and in a manner that does not cause hazard. a similar study found that nurses working in the public sector often have to work without basic protective gear due to stock-outs. lack of protective clothing exposes workers to occupational hazards and diseases, thereby reducing their efficiency and productivity. hermanus (1999) defined policy as the norms for achieving safe and healthful workplaces. she explained that the laws, regulations, and standards adopted in many countries prohibit various forms of workplace discrimination. it is recommended that the management at an academic hospital develop an occupational health and safety policy which will address health and safety matters in the workplace. occupational health and safety statutory instruments state that every employer should conduct his undertaking in such a manner as to ensure that persons other than those in his employment are not exposed to health hazards. the nurses\u2019 ability to provide safe, healthy and high quality care can be dependent upon their abilities to reason, think, and judge. every individual in life, whether employed or unemployed, has the need to be safe. it is therefore recommended that all employees be trained on their general duties as stipulated in the OHSA. this is further supported by Machabe and Indermun (2013). 61% (n = 77) of the participants indicated that the HS Committee did not hold meetings. 61% (n = 77) of the participants indicated that the HS Committee members never or rarely function as required by the OHSA. 65% (n = 81) of the participants revealed that the HS Committee members never or rarely identify and address shortfalls. if the employer does not adhere to the acts, they will be fined or even face imprisonment. it is therefore recommended that employees be encouraged to report any incidents or near-misses to their supervisors or supervisors before the end of the shift. a majority of participants indicated that medical surveillance records are never or rarely kept safely for 40 years. most participants 95% (n = 120) revealed that it was not possible to access the medical records of an employee without his or her consent. a formal written consent from the employee should be needed to allow any perusal of his or her records. failure to produce these documents will put the hospital management in a negative light before the law without a proof. it is recommended that the employer keep all medical surveillance records for a period of 40 years and comply with the employees\u2019 medical records confidentiality. study revealed 95.4% of section 8; 100% of section 14; 75% of both sections 17 and 19 were not implemented. overall there is 93.3% non-implementation of the selected sections and regulations."}
