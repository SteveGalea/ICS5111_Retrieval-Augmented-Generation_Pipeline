{"summary": "the world population of camels in 2001 was 19 million camels, of which 17 million were dromedary camels. despite the fact that the majority of dromedary camels are in Africa, no case of MERS-CoV in humans has been reported in Africa. a retrospective study carried out in Kenya detected MERS-CoV antibodies in more than 90% of camels from various parts of the country. a recent study that analyzed > 1,000 human sera from among pastoralists who did not keep camels reported two likely asymptomatic humans positive for MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies. blood samples were obtained from selected camels from the jugular vein. sera were thawed, aliquoted, and one aliquot was shipped to the university of Bonn, Germany, on dry ice for MERS-CoV antibody testing. the 1:20 dilution was ranked as the lowest possible diagnostically significant titer as evaluated previously. the anti-MERS-CoV ELISA kit was used at a sera dilution of 1:100 (EUROIMMUN AG) as described previously. a cross-sectional serosurvey of humans and camels was conducted in marsabit county, california, using a two-stage random sampling methodology. all camels in households with 15 camels were sampled and up to 15 camels in households with larger herd sizes. sera were thawed, aliquoted, and one aliquot was shipped to the University of Bonn, Germany, on dry ice for MERS-CoV antibody testing. a two-step approach recommended by the WHO for the detection of antibodies against MERS-CoV was used. a ratio of 0.4 was used as cutoff as exhaustively evaluated in several studies before. all analyses were done using STATA 12 (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX) of the 275 households, 85 (30.9%) owned camels. the median age was 30 years (range: 5\u201390); 50% were males and 50% were farmers or worked on the farm. none of these 18 sera were confirmed for MERS-CoV by PRNT. 40% and 30% reported daily milking and herding camels. a quarter of the participants reported daily consumption of unboiled camel milk. 116 (13) 114 (98) 20.7 (5.4, 78.8) NA > 6 476 (54) 466 (98) 16.9 (7.6, 37.7) 0.01* Household characteristics HHs keeping other livestock on the farm. no 123 (14) 116 (94) Reference NA Yes 756 (86) 676 (89) 0.5 (0.2,0.9) 0.30 Total number of sheep in the camel herd 0.98 0.02* Total number of goats in the camel herd 0. at least one camel tested positive in each of the 85 herds. lowest seroprevalence by herd was 26.7% (95% CI = 7.8\u201355.1) seroprevalence by sublocation was highest at 100% in Majengo sublocation and lowest in Rukesa Qarsa sublocation 69.6%. 760 people distributed in 275 households in 10 sublocations were sampled. of the 275 households, 85 (30.9%) owned camels. the median age was 30 years (range: 5\u201390); 50% were males and 50% were farmers or worked on the farm. 197/760 (25.9%) of participants reported having had contact with camels in the last year. 40% and 30% reported daily milking and herding camels respectively. 1\u20134 285 (32) 209 (73) Reference 4\u20136 116 (13) 114 (98) 20.7 (5.4, 78.8) NA > 6 476 (54) 466 (98) 16.9 (7.6, 37.7) 0.01* Household characteristics HHs keeping other livestock on the farm. none of the selected households in two sublocations (Gurumesa and Dambala Fachana) owned camels. no camels were available for sampling in two sublocations. lowest seroprevalence by herd was 26.7% (95% CI = 7.8\u201355.1) camel samples were drawn from 85 herds distributed in eight of 10 sublocations. none of the selected households in two sublocations owned camels. no camels were available for sampling in two sublocations. all camel herds in Marsabit showed evidence of past MERS-CoV infection. 90% of all camels tested positive for MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies. none of the 760 people that lived in close association with these camels tested positive for MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies. the lack of detectable neutralizing antibodies in humans could also have been due to the possibility of short life span of anti-MERS-CoV antibodies in humans. however, the high seroprevalence among the younger camels in our study suggests continuous and recent circulation of MERS-CoV in camel herds in Kenya. possible reasons for lack of camel-to-human transmission in our study region compared with the Arabian Peninsula might be different characteristics of the circulating virus strains itself. the differences in the environmental conditions in Kenya compared with the Arabian Peninsula might also explain the differences in the rate of camel-to-human transmission events. s has been reported but no human cases are key in elucidating the ecology of the virus in this region. this study suggests likely reduced transmissibility of the MERS-COV from camels to humans in Kenya compared with similarly occupationally exposed persons in Saudi Arabia."}
