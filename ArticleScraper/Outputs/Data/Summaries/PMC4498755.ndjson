{"summary": "the last locally-acquired human rabies case was confirmed in 1959. three imported cases of human rabies have been identified. no rabies virus were found among 6,841 dog specimens tested during 1999\u20132012 and 322 bat specimens tested during 2008\u20132012. rabies confirmed by DFA in 273 animals found in central, southern and eastern Taiwan. three laboratory-confirmed rabies cases were found after testing 11 stored ferret-badger brain specimens collected during July 2010 to August 2012. rabies surveillance mandates physicians to notify clinically suspected cases to the health authority within 24 hours of diagnosis and submit clinical specimens including saliva, serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rabies confirmed if any of the specimens tested positive for rabies virus by diagnostic RT-PCR targeting both L and N genes of Rabies virus [16] physicians needing to provide patients with RIG or rabies vaccines must send in their requests directly to TCDC by fax or email for review. rabies PEP is administered by a newly established PEP application system. rabies reemergence has led to reemergence of animal rabies. rabies preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and 10 doses of RIG (HyperRAB S/D, [Talecris Biotherapeutics]) were administered annually. rabies preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and PEP were provided through 12 designated travel clinics to individuals bitten by mammals. rabies immunization recipients included dog catchers, game wardens, animal shelter workers and veterinarians conducting rabies surveillance. participants were asked about their age, sex, date, place, body part and extent of exposure and injury; history of vaccination against rabies; and phone number. we collected rabies-related inquiries from the record. the inquiries from July 16 to December 28, 2013 included for analysis. healthcare professional also received training on animal bite wound management. Submitted specimens were tested using a multiplex PCR panel containing probes targeting viruses causing encephalitis. the multiplex real-time PCR detected the following pathogens using primers designed based on previously published sequences. medical officers in TCDC would review the application, and decide on whether to approve the application for PEP. physicians were asked to provide rabies PEP immediately, and have their requests reviewed retrospectively, to ensure that all patients needing rabies PEP were given appropriate PEP. after the reemergence of animal rabies, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) in Taiwan established new recommendations of rabies PEP. approximately 250 doses of rabies vaccines and 10 doses of RIG (HyperRAB S/D, [Talecris Biotherapeutics]) were administered annually. rabies PEP service points were expanded to 28 hospitals by the end of July 2013 and further expanded to 60 hospitals by early august. a report was categorized as serious when the patient outcome involved death, life-threatening illness, hospitalization, prolongation of an existing hospitalization, permanent disability, or congenital anomaly. a report was categorized as serious when the patient outcome involved death, life-threatening illness, hospitalization, prolongation of an existing hospitalization, or permanent disability. of the 205 available stored CSF specimens, none tested positive for rabies virus. peak of requests occurred on the week of July 28, two days after rabies was confirmed in a house shrew. median number of PEP requests per week was 289 (range, 107\u2013985) category II exposures consisted of 2,855 applicants (43.9%) and category III in 3,613 applicants (55.6%). Ferret-badgers accounted for 59/223 (26%) of the wildlife exposures. among them, 37 (63%) persons had category III exposure, and 32 received RIG. rabies vaccine and immunoglobulin procurement and use peaked during week 33. the median age of the 13 patients was 53 years (range 31\u201371); 10 were male. all the ferret-badger bites were determined to be category III exposures. the most common questions included risk of animal exposure, clinical manifestations of rabies, transmission routes, and where to receive medical care for rabies. daily inquiries about rabies increased to 115 after the first ferret-badger bit human on July 24. after August 20, daily calls never reached above 100 (mean 21.0) the most common reasons for denial included category II or III wounds inflicted by pet dogs or cats (n = 1,245) and exposure as category I (n = 42). people sustained bites requiring PEP concentrated in coastal urban areas. the disposition of animals that bit humans was not available in 5,955 (92%) at the time of vaccine request. of the 6,501 recipients, the disposition of animals that bit humans were not available in 5,955 (92%) at the time of vaccine request. median age of the 13 patients was 53 years (range 31\u201371); 10 were male. all the ferret-badger bites were determined to be category III exposures. 10 received RIG and rabies vaccines and 3 received vaccines only. the first ferret-badger bit human on July 24, and the peak of calls occurred on July 29. the peak of calls never reached above 100 (mean 21.0) the training sessions were hosted by the TCDC along with local health departments and medical societies. intradermal vaccination protocol has been endorsed by WHO to reduce vaccine use. intradermal administration of vaccines requires additional training of healthcare personnel, and is not available in all vaccine administration sites. rabies prevention through PEP costs more than USD800. the peak of PEP requests came shortly after a house shrew was found to be infected by rabies. the subsequent panic-driven vaccine-seeking behavior from the public was expected. increased postexposure vaccine-seeking behavior and increased physician delivery of vaccines have been shown to be associated with episodic importation of rabies. animal rabies reemergence in Taiwan, there is increased perceived risk of illness, thus increased PrEP uptake. rabies control among animals is paramount to minimizing risk transmission of rabies to humans. pets banned from entering national parks and forested areas. the true incidence of animal bites is likely to be much higher than currently reported. current strategy in reporting patients with encephalitis of unknown etiologies may also not be sensitive in selecting patients with furious rabies. surveillance is required for countries with and without rabies to ensure early identification of disease in both humans and animals."}
