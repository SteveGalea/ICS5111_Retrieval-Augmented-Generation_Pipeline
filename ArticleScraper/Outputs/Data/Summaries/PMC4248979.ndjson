{"summary": "the interferon (IFN) system has a major regulatory role in viral pathogenesis. the synthesis of both type I and type III IFNs is induced upon virus infection of cells. the secreted IFNs acting through different receptors in uninfected cells induce the expression of IFN-stimulated genes. in the absence of IRF-3, seV-infected cells become persistently infected. both the ISG induction and the proapoptotic effects of IRF-3 provide anti-SeV innate immune protection. Ifit proteins, 4 in human and 3 in mouse, are distinct but similar in structure. they exert their functional effects through binding to specific cellular or viral RNAs and proteins. Ifit1 and Ifit2 can inhibit initiation of translation by binding to either the initiation factor eIF3 or the 5\u2032 ends of mRNAs. wild-type (wt) mice were purchased from Taconic Farms, Inc. Ifit2/ and Ifit1/ mice were previously described (24, 25) lavage was performed by inflating lungs with 700 l of sterile saline. blood was removed from organs by cardiac perfusion with 10 ml of PBS. cRNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) followed by DNase I treatment. mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital (150 mg/kg) and blood was removed from organs by cardiac perfusion with 10 ml of PBS. the supernatant was used for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. the titer of virus was determined on LLC-MK2 cells (ATCC) after 3 days, plaques were visualized by removal of the agar overlay and incubation with guinea pig red blood cells. an unpaired t test was used to assess significance of mouse survival differences. bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed by inflating lungs with 700 l of sterile saline. blood was removed from organs by cardiac perfusion with 10 ml of PBS. cRNA (0.5 to 1 ng) was used in 384-well real-time PCRs. s targeted the P gene sequence (forward, 5\u2032-CAAAAGTGAGGGCGAAGGAGAA-3\u2032; reverse, 5\u2032-CGCCCAGATCCTGAGATACAGA-3\u2032) primers for murine Ly6G (28) and IFN-3 (29) were published previously. GraphPad Prism 5.02 was used to graph RNA expression as 2CP 18S rRNA/2CP target RNA, where CP is the threshold crossing point. mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital (150 mg/kg) blood was removed from organs after cardiac perfusion with 10 ml of PBS. titer of virus was determined by plaque assay. wt and Ifit2/ mice lost body weight at a much higher rate than wt mice. at this dose, Ifit2/ mice lost body weight at a much higher rate than wt mice. weight loss of wt and Ifit2/ mice infected with the medium SeV dose. asterisks indicate statistical significance. higher viral loads in lungs of the infected mice. mRNA levels in different organs from wt and Ifit2/ mice at 5 dpi measured by real-time RT-PCR. ND, not detected. expression of virus-inducible type I and III interferon mRNAs in lungs. IFN- mRNA (Fig. 3C) and IFN-3 (type III IFN) mRNA (Fig. 3D) were induced by SeV much more in Ifit2/ mice than in wt mice, with levels peaking at 2 dpi. a similarly high induction of IFN- and IFN-3 mRNAs also was observed in IFNAR/ mice. no significant difference in induced levels of IL-6, MCP-1, IFN-, and RANTES was found between the two mouse lines. the IFNAR/ mice also had similar levels of these cytokines and chemokines. 8 T cells late after infection (7 dpi) in both wt and Ifit2/ lungs. similar infiltration by immune cells in wt and Ifit2/ mice at different times after SeV infection. no statistically significant differences between wt and Ifit2/ were found. a lower level of pulmonary virus load combined with high local IFN- expression is sufficient to kill mice. to further test the possibility of type I IFN escalating pathogenesis, we used IFNAR/ mice, in which type III IFN, but not type I IFN, can signal. infectious seV titers in lungs of wt, Ifit2/, and IFNAR/ mice (n = 3 to 5) at 5 days after infection with medium or high SeV dose. IFN- mRNA expression in lungs of wt, Ifit2/, and IFNAR/ mice (n = 4 to 6) at 2 days after SeV infection. wt and Ifit2/ mice are more susceptible to SeV pathogenesis. we tested different doses of virus inoculum: low (0.34 105 PFU/mouse), medium (1.2 105 PFU/mouse) and high (4.9 105 PFU/mouse) Ifit2 protects against morbidity and mortality after SeV infection. survival of wt and Ifit2/ mice with low dose (0.34 105 PFU) (A), medium dose (1.2 105 PFU) (B), or high dose (4.9 105 PFU) (C) a higher viral load in lungs was the cause of pathogenesis in Ifit2/ mice. however, with similarly high viral loads, the IFNAR/ mice were not as susceptible. the levels of type I and III IFN mRNAs were not mediated by type I IFN. however, both IFN- and IFN-3 mRNAs were induced by SeV much more in Ifit2/ mice than in wt mice. a similarly high induction of IFN- and IFN-3 mRNAs also was observed in IFNAR/ mice. a number of cytokines and chemokines were found in the lungs of wt and Ifit2/ mice. no significant difference in the induced levels of IL-6, MCP-1, IFN-, and RANTES was found between the two mouse lines. wt and Ifit2/ mice were more susceptible to SeV (Fig. 1), their lung virus titers were higher (Fig. 2), and they induced more type I and type III IFNs. a higher dose of virus was more lethal for wt mice. a lower level of pulmonary virus load combined with high local IFN- expression is sufficient to kill mice. to further test the possibility of type I IFN escalating pathogenesis, we used IFNAR/ mice, in which type III IFN can signal. IFN- mRNA expression in lungs of wt, Ifit2/, and IFNAR/ mice (n = 4 to 6) at 2 days after SeV infection (medium or high dose), measured by real-time RT-PCR. data for medium dose infection in panels C and D are partially derived from data shown in Fig. 2C and 3C, respectively. the most common animal model for studying SeV pathogenesis uses intranasal infection with the SeV 52 strain, which is fatal even for wt mice at a high dose. both innate and adaptive immunity contribute to the host defense, but the type I IFN system is not required for developing an adaptive immune response against SeV in this mouse model (8). apoptosis triggers the apoptosis of the infected cell by binding to the proapoptotic protein Bax and translocating it to mitochondria (10). both ISG action and the apoptotic response determine the extent of virus replication and the fate of the infected cell. several cytokines and chemokines were induced to similar levels in both lines of mice. there was little difference in lung pathology, as determined by histology of lung sections, and extent of apoptosis. both IFNs can be induced by virus infection, and both can impart antiviral effects by inducing ISGs (3). in the VSV model, these mice were much more susceptible than Ifit2/ mice, showing virus replication in many organs, including brain, liver, and lungs. wt mice infected with medium or high doses of virus were only partially susceptible. the high levels of virus load and IFN- together were causative for causing maximal pathogenesis. the lower susceptibility of the IFNAR/ mice was due to low virus loads. type I IFN is viewed primarily as an antiviral cytokine. but virus-induced IFN- promotes the resultant pathogenesis. the propathogenic role of type I IFN has been noted before."}
