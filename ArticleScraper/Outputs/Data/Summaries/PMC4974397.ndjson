{"summary": "IAV attaches to membrane receptors and enters epithelial, macrophage, and dendritic cells (3). host cells release large quantities of antiviral and immunostimulatory cytokines during IAV infection. there remain many unknown cytokines induced by and involved in the response to IAV infection. IL-35 signals conduct through either a unique heterodimer of IL-12Rb2 and gp130 or homodimers of each chain (14). IL-35 has been linked to various disease, including autoimmune encephalomyelitis (15), autoimmune diabetes (16), inflammatory bowel disorder (17), collagen II-induced arthritis (11), airway inflammation (18), allergic asthma (18, 19), multiple sclerosis (20) and chronic and aggressive periodontitis (21) IL-35 consists of the heterodimeric IL-27/EBI3 chain and the IL-12/p35 chain (11) to investigate induction of IL-35 expression during IAV infection, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from IAV-infected patients and healthy individuals (controls) total RNA was extracted from freshly isolated PBMCs from healthy individuals (n = 12) or IAV-infected patients (n = 12) lowest value from controls was as assigned a value of 1. Data are expressed as -fold induction (folds) relative to the lowest value from controls. IL-35 expression positively correlates with IAV infection. IAV-induced (m.o.i. 1) IL-35 mRNA expression was positively correlated with the infectious dose of IAV. expression of the two IL-35 subunits at various time points was measured in A549 cells infected with 1 m.o.i. IAV. IL-35/p35 mRNA reached peak expression 24 hpi. IL-35/p35 mRNA reached peak expression 24 hpi. similar results were obtained in freshly isolated PBMCs. IL-35 mRNA levels were up-regulated by IAV infection. NF-B was activated by IAV infection with p-IB (36, 37) levels measured in olar type II (AT II) cells. luciferase reporter plasmids containing the IL-35/EBI3 (pIL-35/p35-Luc) were constructed. A549 cells were transfected with EBI3-Luc or a series of truncated and mutated plasmids containing the IL-35/p35 promoter. cells were then infected with IAV (m.o.i. = 1) for 24 h. n.s., not significant. a series of truncated IL-35 promoters were constructed to identify potential regulatory sites. elimination of the 150 to 450 region of pIL-35/eBI3-Luc greatly decreased promoter activity. mutant reporters also encompassed the site 4 region (1368 to 1378) on pIL-35/p35-Luc. overexpression of p65, but not p50, significantly increased IL-35/EBI3 and IL-35/p35 luciferase activity in cells infected with IAV relative to control. COX-2 and iNOS are important inflammatory factors regulating interleukins expression induced by viral infection. we investigated the roles of COX-2 and iNOS in IAV-induced IL-35 expression. IL-35 mRNA levels increased with COX-2 overexpression. DMSO and IAV infection without inhibitor were used as solvent and positive controls. expression of IL-35 mRNA was significantly up-regulated by PGE2. C, A549 cells were transfected with si-COX-2 or siRNA-control for 24 h. qRT-PCR analysis of IL-35 expression was performed as in A. IL-35 and COX-2 mRNA levels were measured in PBMCs from IAV-infected patients then subjected to correlation analysis. statistically significant correlation was found between IL-35 and iNOS expression during IAV infection. iNOS and COX-2 may positively regulate IAV-induced IL-35 expression in A549 cells. IL-35 Hampers Virus Replication We sought to determine the biological function of -+IL-35 during virus infection. overexpression of IL-35 in A549 cells did not strongly affect IAV replication. the incubation of IL-35-transfected Jurkat cells can inhibit IAV replication effectively. our results indicate that the incubation of IL-35 cells with the supernatants of IL-35-transfected cells can inhibit IAV replication effectively. rhIL-35-treated Jurkat cells were treated with doses of rhIL-35 or co-treated with 2 g/ml IFN for 24 h. cell viability was measured using the MTT assay. RD cells were cultured then incubated with the supernatants described in A. iFN and STAT1-dependent expression of IL-12R2 were crucial for T cell activation. in human cancer cell lines, IL-35 expression can be induced after TNF- and IFN stimulation. IL-35 decreased production of IL-17 but can also increase IFN production. EV71 VP1 expression was measured using absolute qRT-PCR. rhIL-35 overexpression inhibited EV71 copy numbers. we then assessed the effects of the above protocol on the production of recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus. EV71-infected RD cells cultured with these PBMC-derived supernatants. these data indicate treatment with the above PBMC-derived supernatants had antiviral functions in IAV infection, but also in VSV, HBV, and EV71 infection. IL-35 has extensive antiviral activity to DNA and RNA viruses. Jurkat cells were transfected with pCMV-IL-35 or control vector for 36 h. they were transfected with pCMV-IL-35 or control vector for 24 h. experiments performed as in A, except IFN- (C), IFN- (D), or IFN-1 (E) protein levels were measured by ELISA. IFNAR1 and IFNLR1 were detected by Western blot with indicated antibody. qRT-PCR analysis and Western blots revealed expression of downstream IFN effectors can be induced by IL-35. IL-35 expression Is Elevated in Patients Infected with IAV IL-35 consists of the heterodimeric IL-27/EBI3 chain and the IL-12/p35 chain (11) to investigate induction of IL-35 expression during IAV infection, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from IAV-infected patients. IL-35 is elevated in IAV-infected patients compared with controls. a statistically significant correlation was observed between NP and IL-35 mRNA levels in PBMCs from IAV-infected patients. IL-35 expression positively correlates with IAV infection. IAV-induced (m.o.i. 1) IL-35 expression was positively correlated with the infectious dose of IAV. expression of the two IL-35 subunits at various time points was measured in A549 cells infected with 1 m.o.i. IAV. IL-35/p35 mRNA reached peak expression 24 hpi. IL-35/eBI3 and IL-35/p35 mRNA reached peak expression 48 hpi. IL-35 expression was up-regulated 2-fold by IAV infection compared with mock infection. similar results were obtained in freshly isolated PBMCs and alveolar type II (AT II) cells. NF-B was activated by IAV infection with p-IB (36, 37) levels measured in A549 cells. B, A549 cells were transfected with EBI3-Luc or a series of truncated and mutated plasmids containing the IL-35/p35 promoter. cells were then infected with IAV (m.o.i. = 1) for 24 h. a series of truncated IL-35 promoters were constructed to identify potential regulatory sites. elimination of the 150 to 450 region of pIL-35/eBI3-Luc greatly decreased promoter activity. the results suggest that the 360 to 347 and 233 to 242 NF-B (p65/p50) binding sites are important for IAV-induced activation of the IL-35/p35 promoter. site 3 is an important cis-regulatory element binding site in IL-18 and IL-1-induced IL-27/EBI3 promoter activity (38). mutant reporters also encompassed the site 4 region (1368 to 1378) on pIL-35/p35-Luc. overexpression of p65, but not p50, significantly increased IL-35/EBI3 and IL-35/p35 luciferase activity in cells infected with IL-35/p35 promoter was bound by p65 at much higher levels with IAV infection compared with control. NF-B/p65 is an important element required for IAV-induced activation of the IL-35 promoter. COX-2 and iNOS are important inflammatory factors regulating interleukins expression induced by viral infection. we incubated A549 cells with the dissolved prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) for 2 h, then infected with IAV. expression of IL-35 mRNA was significantly up-regulated by PGE2. the results showed that expression of IL-35 mRNA was significantly up-regulated by PGE2. relative iNOS and EBI3 (K) or p35 (L) mRNA levels in PBMCs from IAV-infected patients were subjected to Pearson correlation analysis. IL-35 and COX-2 mRNA levels were measured in PBMCs from IAV-infected patients. RNA levels were measured and analyzed using Pearson's correlation. a statistically significant correlation was found between IL-35 and iNOS expression. both COX-2 and iNOS may positively regulate IAV-induced IL-35 expression in A549 cells. ense RNA were measured 3 hpi via qRT-PCR. supernatant IAV titers were measured using a hemagglutinin assay 24 hpi. this treatment significantly decreased NP RNA levels. kat cells were treated with 100 ng/ml rhIL-35 and 2 g/ml IFN. twenty-four hours later the supernatants were collected. cell viability was measured using the MTT assay. -23 interacted with IL-12, IL-18, and IL-2 to promote IFN production in NK cells. evidence also suggested that IFN and STAT1-dependent expression of IL-12R2 were crucial for T cell activation. IL-35 decreased production of IL-17 but can also increase IFN production (11) cells were incubated with supernatants of jurkat cells described in Fig. 5, A or C. we then infected with human enterovirus 71 (EV71) (m.o.i. = 1). Replication of EV71 was inhibited by IL-35 overexpression. IAV NP RNA levels and virus titers were reduced in IAV (m.o.i. = 1)-infected A549 cells incubated with the above PBMC-derived supernatants. HBeAg and HBsAg expression was reduced in pHBV-transfected Huh7 cells cultured with the same PBMC-derived supernatants. EV71 copy numbers were also reduced in 1 m.o.i. pCMV-IL-35-transfected Jurkat cells were transfected with pCMV-IL-35 or control vector for 36 h before analysis the IFN-//1 RNA levels using qRT-PCR. experiments performed as in A, except IFN- (C), IFN- (D), or IFN-1 (E), were measured by ELISA. all experiments were performed at least in triplicate with similar results. J, A549 cells were transfected with shIFNAR1, shIFNLR1 and shRNA-control for 48 h. IFNAR1 and IFNLR1 were detected by Western blot. viral action, IFNAR1 or IFNLR1 were knocked down by shIFNAR1 or shIFNLR1. IL-35 can induce IFN production and stimulate expression of downstream IFN effectors. induced IFNs mediate IL-35 anti-viral activity. 35 mRNA levels were 4-fold higher in IAV-infected patients compared with controls. the lowest value from controls was as assigned a value of 1. Data are expressed as -fold induction (folds) relative to the lowest value from controls. NP and IL-35 mRNA levels were observed in PBMCs from IAV-infected patients. high levels of IL-35 mRNA were observed in different cell types. IL-35 expression positively correlates with IAV infection. p19, p28, and p40 mRNA were quantified using ELISA. experiments performed as in C, except IL-35 protein was detected using ELISA. F, experiments were performed as in C, except where AT II cells were used. heat-inactivated IAV did not significantly increase IL-35 expression. IL-35 expression was up-regulated 2-fold by IAV infection compared with mock infection. similar results were obtained in freshly isolated PBMCs and alveolar type II (AT II) cells. 49 cells were transfected with luciferase reporter plasmids containing the IL-35/EBI3 (EBI3-Luc) or IL-35/p35 promoter (p35-Luc) along with pRL-TK. cells were either infected or not infected with IAV (m.o.i. = 1) for 24 h. pCMV-p50 or pCMV-p65 were detected by Western blot a series of truncated IL-35 promoters was constructed to identify potential regulatory sites. elimination of the 150 to 450 region of pIL-35/EBI3-Luc greatly decreased promoter activity. mutant reporters were constructed for the NF-B binding sites. these reporters encompassed site 1 (360 to 347), site 2 (233 to 242) and site 3 (84 to 97) regions of pIL-35/eBI3-Luc. results suggest there was a decrease in IAV-induced mutant reporter luciferase activity compared with activity using the wild-type promoter. three fragments on the IL-35/EBI3 promoter and one on the IL-35/p35 promoter were bound by p65 at much higher levels with IAV infection compared with control. these data suggest that NF-B/p65 is an important element required for IAV-induced activation of the IL-35 promoter. we investigated the roles of COX-2 and iNOS in IAV-induced IL-35 expression. we incubated A549 cells with the dissolved prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) for 2 h. we infected with IAV (m.o.i. = 1). expression of IL-35 mRNA was significantly up-regulated by PGE2. I, experiments were performed as in B and C, except si-iNOS was transfected. relative iNOS and EBI3 (K) or p35 (L) mRNA levels in PBMCs from IAV-infected patients were subjected to Pearson correlation analysis. IL-35 and iNOS expression were measured and analyzed using Pearson's correlation. a statistically significant correlation was found between IL-35 and iNOS expression. both COX-2 and iNOS may positively regulate IAV-induced IL-35 expression in A549 cells. IAV NP RNA levels, including plus-sense RNA and minus-sense RNA were measured 3 hpi via qRT-PCR. supernatant IAV titers were measured using a hemagglutinin assay 24 hpi. this treatment significantly decreased NP RNA levels and decreased IAV titers.

C and D, Jurkat cells were treated with 100 ng/ml rhIL-35 and 2 g/ml IFN. twenty-four hours later the supernatants were collected. IL-12 was positively regulated by IFN (43, 44), and IL-23 interacted with IL-12, IL-18, and IL-2 to promote IFN production in NK cells (45). evidence also suggested that IFN and STAT1-dependent expression of IL-12R2 were crucial for T cell activation (47). rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells were incubated with supernatants of Jurkat cells described in Fig. 5, A or C. then infected with human enterovirus 71 (EV71) 12 h later, EV71 VP1 expression was measured using absolute qRT-PCR. results show relatively lower HBeAg and HBsAg levels. freshly isolated PBMCs from healthy donors were electroporated with pCMV-IL-35 or vector. supernatants were collected for antiviral assays. IFN-, IFN-, and IFN-1 mRNA levels significantly increased with pCMV-IL-35 transfection compared with vector transfection. pCMV-IL-35-transfected Jurkat cells were transfected with pCMV-IL-35 or control vector for 36 h before analysis the IFN-//1 RNA levels using qRT-PCR. IFN- (Fig. 7C), IFN- (Fig. 7D) and IFN-1 (Fig. 7E) were activated in pCMV-IL-35-transfected cells compared with vector transfection. jurkat cells were transfected with pCMV-IL-35. cells were then infected with 1 m.o.i. IAV. similar results were obtained using rhIL-35. IL-35 mediated IL-35 anti-viral action was knocked down by shIFNAR1 or shIFNLR1. the anti-viral action of IL-35 was not detected in the presence of either shIFNAR1 or shIFNLR1. the induced IFNs mediate IL-35 anti-viral activity. controls, 10.23, n = 10, black box; controls,10.44 3.803, n = 10, white box; **, p 0.01, Fig. 1B, left), and p35 mRNA levels were 4-fold higher in IAV-infected patients compared with controls. data indicate that IL-35 is elevated in IAV-infected patients. NP and IL-35 mRNA levels were analyzed using Pearson's correlation. a statistically significant correlation was observed between NP and IL-35 levels in PBMCs from IAV-infected patients. 49 cells were infected with heat-inactivated IAV (65 \u00b0C, 1 h) or IAV (m.o.i. = 1) for 24 h; EBI3, p35, p19, p28, and p40 mRNA were quantified.

IAV induces IL-35 expression at the transcriptional level. A, A549 cells were transfected with luciferase reporter plasmids containing the IL-35/EBI3 (EBI3-Luc) or IL-35/p35 promoter (p35-Luc) along with pRL-TK for 24 h. Luciferase activity was measured after 12 h-serum starvation. a series of truncated IL-35 promoters were constructed to identify potential regulatory sites. elimination of the 150 to 450 region of pIL-35/EBI3-Luc greatly decreased promoter activity. n.s., not significant. four mutant reporters were constructed for the NF-B binding sites. these reporters encompassed site 1 (360 to 347), site 2 (233 to 242) and site 3 (84 to 97) regions of pIL-35/eBI3-Luc. results suggest there was a decrease in IAV-induced mutant reporter luciferase activity compared with activity using the wild-type promoter. three fragments on the IL-35/EBI3 promoter and one on the IL-35/p35 promoter were bound by p65 at much higher levels with IAV infection compared with control. these data suggest that NF-B/p65 is an important element required for IAV-induced activation of the IL-35 promoter. IL-35 expressions were confirmed to be down-regulated by COX-2 silencing with siCOX-2-#2. these data suggest that COX-2 positively regulates IAV-induced IL-35 expression. we incubated A549 cells with the dissolved prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) for 2 h. mRNA levels in PBMCs from IAV-infected patients were subjected to Pearson correlation analysis (n = 20) IL-35 and COX-2 mRNA levels were measured in PBMCs from IAV-infected patients then subjected to correlation analysis. IL-35 mRNAs were up-regulated in A549 cells with sodium nitroferricyanide(III) dihydrate (SNP) incubation. PBMCs were isolated from IAV-infected patients. a statistically significant correlation was found between IL-35 and iNOS expression. IL-35 protein levels in the supernatants were measured by ELISA. supernatants were collected for antiviral experiments. IAV NP RNA levels, including plus-sense RNA and minus-sense RNA, were measured 3 hpi. antiviral assays were performed in 1 m.o.i. IAV-infected A549 cells incubated for 24 h. IAV RNAs (A) and IAV production (B) were analyzed using qRT-PCR. rhIL-35 inhibits IAV replication using commercial rhIL-35. previous studies demonstrated interactions between interleukins and IFN. IL-12 was positively regulated by IFN and IL-23 interacted with IL-12, IL-18, and IL-2 to promote IFN production in NK cells. rhIL-35 cells were incubated with supernatants of Jurkat cells described in Fig. 5, A or C. then infected with human enterovirus 71 (EV71) 12 h later, EV71 VP1 expression was measured using absolute qRT-PCR. results show relatively lower HBeAg and HBsAg levels. PBMCs from healthy donors were electroporated with pCMV-IL-35 or vector. the supernatants were collected for antiviral assays. IL-35 has extensive antiviral activity to DNA and RNA viruses. IFN-, IFN-, and IFN-1 mRNA levels were up-regulated in pCMV-IL-35-transfected PBMCs compared with vector transfection. pCMV-IL-35-transfected Jurkat cells were transfected with pCMV-IL-35 or control vector for 36 h before analysis the IFN-//1 RNA levels. mRNA levels of IFN-, IFN-, and IFN-1 were measured using qRT-PCR. IFN-stimulated gene protein levels of PKR, OAS, and Mx were detected. all experiments were performed at least in triplicate with similar results. similar results were obtained using rhIL-35. the expression of IFN-, IFN-, and IFN-1 were all induced by rhIL-35 in a time-dependent manner. the PKR, OAS, and Mx were also up-regulated. IL-35 is significantly up-regulated in these three cell types during IAV infection. the transcription factor, NF-kB/p65, and the inflammatory factors COX-2 and iNOS can also activate the IFN pathway. IL-35 can also activate the IFN pathway and may have potential antiviral activity. our findings suggest that COX-2 and iNOS may be important factors in IAV-induced IL-35 expression. also, both COX-2 and iNOS mRNA levels are positively correlated with IL-35 mRNA levels in IAV-infected blood samples. IL-35 is detectable in peripheral CD4+ T cells and is believed to play important functions in inhibition of the immune response during chronic HBV infection. hypothetical model of IAV-induced IL-35 production and its biological function.

IL-35/EBI3 and IL-35/p35 promoters, the truncates, and mutants were amplified using genomic PCR. target sequence mutations were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using specific primers. the following primer pairs for the mutagenesis of luciferase reporters were: for IL-35/eBI3 promoter site 1 mutant, 5\u2032-TGCCTGGGGTTTTAGCCGCTTCAGGGC-3\u2032 (sense), 5\u2032-ACCCCTGCTCGGAAAACAACGAGGGT-3\u2032 (antisense); for IL-35/p35 promoter site 4 mutant PKR, OAS, Mx, GAPDH, NF-B/p65 and p50, IFNAR1, IFNLR1, IB, p-IB, and IL-35/EBI3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); antibodies against IL-35/p35 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN); a human IL-35 ELISA kit (eBioscience, San Diego, CA); recombinant human for IL-35/p35, 5\u2032-GTACCAGGTGGAGTTCAA-3\u2032 (sense), 5\u2032-AATAGTCACTGCCCGAAT-3\u2032 (antisense); for p28, 5\u2032-CGCTTTGCGGAATCTC-3\u2032 (sense); for p40, 5\u2032-AGGGACATCATCAAACCTGACC-3\u2032 (antisense); for iNOS, 5\u2032-GTTCTCTTTTTGCCCAGCACT-3 EV71 copies were measured using the absolute value of qPCR of viral VP-1 with primers. total RNAs were extracted with TRIzol according to manufacturer's instructions. NP qPCR primers were 5\u2032-ATCAGACCGAACGAGAATCCAGC-3\u2032 (sense), 5\u2032-CCACCACCACCCAAGTTTCCTGTA-3\u2032 (antisense) Western blot analysis was performed with samples normalized to GAPDH or -actin. ELISA IL-35 concentration in culture supernatants was measured using a human IL-35 ELISA kit (88-7357, eBioscience), with an EBI3-specific capture antibody and a p35-specific detection antibody. cells were transfected with luciferase reporter plasmids containing the promoter of IL-35 and pRL-TK infected with IAV. rhIL-35 (0, 5, 10, 50, 100, or 500 ng/ml) was added to wells with or without IFN. each group contained a zero-value well with DMSO but without cells. mTT reagent (20 l) was added to each well, and cells were cultured for 4 h. DMSO (150 l) was added to each well with shaking for 10 min."}
