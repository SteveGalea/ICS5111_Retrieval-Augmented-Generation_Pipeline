{"summary": "neglected tropical infectious diseases have historically lacked adequate attention in international public health efforts. this subset of 17 infectious tropical diseases disproportionately impacts the world's poorest, represents a significant and underappreciated global disease burden. this subset of 17 infectious tropical diseases disproportionately impacts the world's poorest. emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) and reemerging infectious diseases (ReIDs) can arise due to a multitude of factors and influences and must be addressed dynamically by diverse sectors of society. societal influences, human susceptibility to infection, demographics, availability of health care, food production, human behavior, trade and travel, environmental and ecological changes, economic development, war and famine. the development of antimicrobial resistance has resulted in the emergence of diseases that were otherwise rare (15, 16) most notably, the development of antimicrobial resistance with new pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli, multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant jj in saudi arabia may represent newly recognized social mechanisms for rapid spread of infectious diseases. these include highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus. concerns over its high virulence and case fatality rate have disastrous public health effects. this article presents an overview of emerging and reemerging infectious diseases within the context of neglected tropical diseases concepts. it also identifies, characterizes, and assesses the common risk factors of a newly identified group of emerging and reemerging neglected tropical diseases. this article expands on previous work that first identified and defined the category of EReNTDs by reviewing the medical literature for key topics. the CDC currently recognizes over 50 emerging or reemerging diseases. it defines emerging infectious diseases as new infections resulting from new unknown pathogens, known infections which are increasing over new geographic areas. the CDC also publishes research on EIDs and ReIDs in its journal Emerging Infectious Diseases. the NIH defines emerging and reemerging diseases by dividing them into three groups. group 1 diseases include those newly recognized in the last 20 years, group 2 diseases include reemerging diseases, and group 3 diseases include those caused by agents with potential for bioterrorism threat.

NTD-dedicated funding dwarfed by investments in diseases such as HIV/AIDS (36.3%), malaria (3.6%), and TB (2.2%) (69, 72) research and development (R&D) funding for NTDs, reported at $3 billion in 2011, has also experienced recent nominal declines following the global financial crisis. seven of the 17 NTDs are identified as targeted NZDs by WHO. rabies, human africa trypanosomiasis, leishmaniasis, taeniasis/cysticercosis, echinococcosis, food-borne trematodiases, and schistosomiasis (81). global trends in changing climate may facilitate migration of NTD vectors into new regions where they previously were not endemic. short epidemics of visceral leishmaniasis were observed in the northeast south American cities of So Luis and Teresina during major droughts caused by El Nio in 1983 to 1985. poverty also has strong links to NTDs, particularly by its social expression as substandard housing conditions, lack of access to safe water, and poor environmental sanitation. poor housing can obstruct and complicate vector control efforts, leading to increased exposure to diseases such as dengue, leishmaniasis, lymphatic filariasis, and Chagas disease. lower relative wealth in equatorial regions can be considered both an associated risk and an enabling factor for the spread and incidence of NTDs and other tropical diseases (34). regions around the equator receive more direct sunlight than less-equatorial regions, thereby increasing the ability of plants to survive (123). this proliferation in primary energy production through plant life results in higher levels of biodiversity throughout ecological food webs in tropical regions (124). these diseases can have a significant negative impact on maternal and child health if not detected and treated appropriately (132, 133). this includes exacerbating blood loss during pregnancy (a leading cause of maternal death), mother-to-child transmission (e.g., of Chagas disease), and gender-specific consequences of NTDs such as female urogenital schistosomiasis (36, 134). NTDs may also prevent adequate nutrient delivery for proper fetal and childhood development (1 the majority of individuals and communities in these regions have far less access to the resources necessary to address the social determinants of NTDs. they may live in poor sanitary conditions, have inadequate nutrition, and lack access to necessary public health and health care systems for treatment. the global focus to identify and prioritize NTDs by the international community only \u201creemerging\u201d in the last decade following efforts by leading NTD researchers and advocates. more than half of the world's population is at risk from vector-borne diseases (such as malaria and dengue) as its main topic for world health day 2014. more than half of the world's population is at risk from vector-borne diseases. the impact of NTDs is therefore disastrous in resource-poor settings. this results in NTDs disproportionately impacting the poorest and most vulnerable. unlike certain EIDs and ReIDs, they have also been neglected in drug development efforts (43, 44, 58\u201360) these donations are often in the form of commitments for large or unlimited quantities of medicines, leading to increased treatment coverage. some US$1.2 billion in grants from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) aimed to fill gaps in, rather than duplicate, disease research funding streams. ivermectin, praziquantel, and azithromycin have a yearly cost of $200,000,000 for the preventive chemotherapy of 500,000,000 individuals (with any of 7 NTDs), resulting in significant treatment cost-effectiveness of only $0.40 per person per year. indirect costs to the broader economy suggest even greater cost-efficacy, as there is considerable savings in averting decreased labor productivity from NTD infection. negative zoonotic diseases (NZDs) are a subset of NTDs prioritized by the WHO. the transmission of these NZDs may be direct or indirect through vectors such as mosquitos, ticks, animal reservoirs, or other zoonotic agents found in water, food, and soil. the existence of these diseases raises the importance of broad ecologies that influence the protection of human populations. over 40% of the human population (about 3 billion people) currently live in the tropics. there is a high potential for NTD risk in the overall global population. however, several factors have allowed these diseases to affect populations outside these tropical regions that are typically areas of endemicity. more intense public health efforts would be required to facilitate end of leishmaniasis endemicity in perpetually conducive regions. distribution of social roles may also result in differential risks for NTD transmission and infection (106) women responsible for collecting water and children who play in it or in mud may expose themselves to NTD vectors that thrive near aquatic environments. poor sanitation due to inadequate garbage disposal/collection can also result in breeding sites for many NTD arthropod vectors (such as the sandfly) and subsequently increased risk (115, 116). disability and morbidity arise from a host of NTD-related symptoms. these include excessive bleeding, paralysis, hallucinations, delirium, blindness, seizures, elephantiasis, and extreme pain (7, 45) these diseases can have a significant negative impact on maternal and child health if not detected and treated appropriately. children with NTDs have higher rates of absenteeism than healthier counterparts. a child's ability to play, learn, and intellectually develop are seriously impaired by NTDs. a child's ability to play, learn, and intellectually develop are seriously impaired by NTDs. EReNTDs present the additional risks associated with being both EIDs and ReIDs. they pose a potential \u201cdual\u201d threat given that they are spreading and emerging in areas where they were previously not endemic and are also \u201cneglected\u201d. EReNTDs impact the world's poorest populations who have few treatment options. WHO priority neglected zoonotic disease Disease agent class Etiological agent Animal vectors/reservoirs Chagas disease CDC Not listed No Parasitic (protozoon) Trypanosoma cruzi Triatomine bug (genus Triatoma) Cysticercosis CDC Not listed Yes Parasitic (protozoon) Trypanosoma cruzi Triatomine bug (genus Triatoma) Cysticercosis CDC Not listed Yes Para dengue is an acute febrile disease caused by one of five serotypes of arthropod-borne dengue viruses. it is characterized as an \u201cold\u201d disease that has reemerged in the last half of the 20th century (154, 155) it is characterized as an \u201cold\u201d disease that has reemerged in the last half of the 20th century (154, 155) a fifth new serotype of dengue virus was reported in late 2013, confounding efforts to develop a potential vaccine that can effectively protect against all types of disease. a fifth new serotype of dengue virus was reported in late 2013, confounding efforts to develop a potential vaccine that can effectively protect against all types of disease. dengue has been associated with global travel to tropical and subtropical regions. it has also been identified as a risk for military populations who operate in areas of endemicity (161, 170, 171) outbreaks in the united states highlight the growing global health risk of disease transmission of this EReNTD. a live-attenuated, tetravalent chimeric dengue-yellow fever vaccine showed limited protective immunity against the first four dengue virus serotypes (177) dengue is an important EReNTD focus beyond its direct global health impact on patient populations. this may reflect viral evolution toward greater virulence. Chagas disease, also known as american trypanosomiasis, is an EReNTD caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. it is a common chronic, systemic infection, and has an annual mortality rate of approximately 10,000 (7, 45, 181, 182) new cases arise primarily in the poor within areas of Latin America where it is endemic. approximately 14 million people have migrated from countries where Chagas disease is endemic to areas where it is not. the development of a vaccine or new, cost-effective antiprotozoal drugs is critical for management of the disease (34). rabies is an acute, progressive encephalitis caused by a group of RNA viruses that has close to a 100% mortality rate if left untreated (200). rabies is caused by members of the genus Lyssavirus in the family Rhabdoviridae and is generally spread via contact with infected animal saliva (7). greater than 15 million people each year are given specific postexposure treatment, but there are still an estimated 50,000 annual rabies deaths worldwide. treatment is effective, with an estimated 270,000 lives saved due to effective postexposure prophylaxis among worldwide rabies cases. the highest risk for rabies incidence occurs in the poor in regions such as africa, Asia, and Latin America. international travelers are the largest population group to receive preexposure prophylaxis. new virus serotypes of rabies infection are being detected in previously uncommon reservoirs. fox-to-dog transmission of rabies has occurred following widespread vaccination efforts. international animal trade poses a largely unchecked and significant potential for rabies zoonotic disease spread (7, 219, 220, 223\u2013227) human cysticercosis is an infectious disease caused by the ingestion of eggs of the pork tapeworm, Taenia solium, through fecal-oral transmission (233, 234) this typically occurs through a 2-host life cycle where the intermediate host (pigs) ingests food or water contaminated by eggs excreted in the feces of humans infected with the adult tapeworm, which then disseminate and mature into the larval stage in the tissue of pigs and the disease is particularly a problem in areas of endemicity, including many countries in Latin America and Southeast Asia, India, Haiti, and parts of China (7, 237) it is most recognized as a public health crisis in sub-Saharan Africa (7). the disease has been associated with poverty in populations within high-income countries and poorer populations in areas of endemicity. two recombinant antigens for Taenia solium shown to be 98.6% and 99.9% effective at protecting pigs from infection after oral administration of T. solium eggs. this drastically reduces the likelihood of human neurocysticercosis infection after consumption of the intermediate porcine host. T. b. gambiense is responsible for the majority of cases and occurs in west and central africa. domestic and wild animals can become infected with both parasitic subspecies and act as carriers or reservoirs for the tsetse fly vector. the disease is restricted to sub-Saharan Africa, where the tsetse vector resides. clinical symptoms of HAT can be complex and difficult to diagnose. symptoms can be delayed by months or even years depending on subspecies of trypanosoma brucei involved. common symptoms after transmission include fever, headache, pain and weakness in joints, and severe neurological and psychiatric disorders. control of the disease requires active surveillance, vector control, and strengthening of health system capacity. negative socioeconomic impact of HAT is particularly severe due to the devastating physical and mental disabilities associated with disease progression. the disease's long incubation period in the T. b. gambiense subspecies can lead to importation into regions where it is not endemic. despite this geographical containment, the disease's long incubation period in the subspecies can lead to misdiagnosis if clinicians are unaware of the disease. sibility of mortality if EReNTD cases are not treated appropriately Associated with chronic disease and long-term disability Sometimes undifferentiated disease symptoms at early stage of infection Complex cases and costly interventions arising from disease progression. unconfirmed reports of the use of mosquito vectors and dengue as a potential weapon for bioterrorism. EReNTDs are notable for their significant negative economic impacts on afflicted, poorer rural communities, tremendous morbidity and mortality exacerbated by poverty and social determinants of health. this dependence on vector control is due to the frequent lack of access to safe or effective treatment. no EReNTDs have an approved vaccine, with exception of targeted preexposure rabies immunization in both animals and humans (8). Vaccine development for other infectious diseases may have potential, including the bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin vaccine for tuberculosis. a critical area of need for many EReNTDs is continued investment, innovation, and development. common EReNTD treatment regimes often are dangerous, difficult to administer, lack pediatric formulations, and do not necessarily address the causative agents or downstream public health impact. the quality of NTD medicines has come into question as part of larger global concerns regarding the ongoing public health problem of counterfeit, falsified, and substandard medicines in low-resource settings. broad private sector adoption of voluntary standards may promote increased environmental stewardship. there are significantly underdeveloped public health strategic interventions, health promotion and education efforts. there are available diagnostic tools and treatment options for effectively fighting the increasing EReNTD spread across developing and developed countries. emerging and reemerging neglected tropical diseases (EReNTDs) are an aggregation of disease states that are significant due to challenges associated with their prevention and treatment, their geographical expansion, and their negative impact on economic and social progress. five specific EReNTDs are identified: dengue, Chagas disease, cysticercosis, human African trypanosomiasis, and rabies. the global importance and challenges of NTDs are magnified for EReNTD EReNTDs lack adequate prioritization in global health interventions and policy and innovation efforts. they have the potential to continue to spread and impact millions who are least able to combat them. EReNTDs have devastating impacts on affected countries and regions. three of the five EReNTDs are also categorized as targeted WHO NZDs. all EReNTDs are caused by either parasitic or viral disease agents. two of the EReNTDs are also listed on the NIH group 3 list. common symptoms are high fever, headache, abdominal pain, myalgia, arthralgia, and rash. common symptoms are high fever, headache, abdominal pain, myalgia, arthralgia, and rash. dengue virus infects between 50 million and 100 million people globally. a fifth new serotype of dengue virus was reported in late 2013, confounding efforts to develop a potential vaccine that can effectively protect against all types of the disease. dengue resurgence or emergence occurs in many poorer regions with no previous experience in preventing, combatting, or controlling it or in regions that have not had a reported case in greater than 20 years. dengue accounts for 2% of all travel-related illness of those returning from regions of endemicity. risk factors include length of stay, season of travel, and prevalence of dengue at the destination country. public health interventions for dengue focus on environmental and vector management. a live-attenuated, tetravalent chimeric dengue-yellow fever vaccine showed limited protective immunity against the first four dengue virus serotypes (177) dengue is an important EReNTD focus beyond its direct global health impact on patient populations. this may reflect viral evolution toward greater virulence, potentially from patient reinfection by one of the now five different dengue virus serotypes. the parasite can infect a number of wildlife and domestic animal species reservoirs. it is spread to humans generally through contact with fecal matter deposited by the triatomine insect near the site of its bite or mucous membranes. this insect vector often infests poorly constructed or substandard housing (183, 184) comorbid infectious diseases such as HIV disease can lead to immunosuppression and reactivation of T. cruzi infection and other latent diseases. at present, there is no vaccine to prevent Chagas disease; experimental efforts for a postexposure vaccine for cardioprotection are in testing. more than 15 million people each year are given specific postexposure treatment. there are still an estimated 50,000 annual rabies deaths worldwide. the highest risk for rabies incidence occurs in the poor in regions such as africa, Asia, and Latin America. international travelers are the largest population group to receive preexposure prophylaxis. large social events raised concerns about rabies due to large population movements and tourism. negative economic consequences can also occur due to loss of livestock from canine rabies exposure, especially in Asia (214). new virus serotypes of rabies infection are being detected in previously uncommon animal reservoirs. enzootic bat lyssaviruses are being detected across Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia. fox-to-dog transmission of rabies has occurred following widespread vaccination efforts. international animal trade poses a largely unchecked and significant potential for rabies zoonotic disease spread. cysticercosis is one of the most common causes of acquired epilepsy in developing countries. the disease is particularly a problem in areas of endemicity, including many countries in Latin America and Southeast Asia, India, Haiti, and parts of China. cysticercosis has been detected in high-income countries such as the united states and canada through migration of agricultural workers and travel of these workers to and from regions of endemicity (117, 233, 237, 239) cysticercosis transmission has been detected in high-income countries such as the united states and Canada through migration of agricultural workers and travel of these workers. human africa trypanosomiasis (HAT) is a complex vector-borne parasitic infection caused by the trypanosoma brucei protozoan transmitted to humans via bites from blood-feeding tsetse flies. the parasitic worm's glucose uptake by binding to tubulin proteins in microtubules can effectively treat porcine Taenia solium infections. infected with both parasitic subspecies and act as reservoirs for the tsetse fly vector. the disease is restricted to sub-Saharan africa, where the tsetse vector resides. it involves zoonotic transmission and outbreaks often involving cattle (252, 254, 255) the disease can also cause amenorrhea, sterility, and abortion. the disease can also cause amenorrhea, sterility, and abortion. the disease can also cause amenorrhea, sterility, and abortion and can be contracted congenitally. children engaged in activities that lead to increased exposure to the disease vector can also experience problems in growth and intellectual development. livestock and agricultural production in rural communities are at risk of exposure to \u201cnagana,\u201d the animal form of HAT (7, 272, 273) dengue is an acute febrile disease caused by one of five serotypes of arthropod-borne dengue viruses. it is characterized as an \u201cold\u201d disease that has reemerged in the last half of the 20th century (154, 155) in some severe cases, such as those who suffer from dengue shock syndrome (DSS), can lead to death (7, 156) a fifth new serotype of dengue virus was reported in late 2013, confounding efforts to develop a potential vaccine that can effectively protect against all types of disease. a fifth new serotype of dengue virus was reported in late 2013, confounding efforts to develop a potential vaccine that can effectively protect against all types of the disease. dengue accounts for 2% of all travel-related illness of those returning from regions of endemicity, especially Southeast Asia (161) it has also been identified as a risk for military populations who operate in areas of endemicity (161, 170, 171) outbreaks in the states of Texas, Hawaii, and Florida highlight the growing global health risk of disease transmission of this EReNTD (9, 172). dengue is an important EReNTD focus beyond its direct global health impact on patient populations. it is also of concern because of an increase in mortality due to a rising incidence of DHF and DSS. this may reflect viral evolution toward greater virulence. eNTD caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi has an annual mortality rate of approximately 10,000 (7, 45, 181, 182) new cases arise primarily in the poor within areas of Latin America where it is endemic. Chagas disease can lead to significant economic losses due to reduced productivity from early-age mortality and disability (47). approximately 14 million people have migrated from countries where Chagas disease is endemic to areas where it is not (188). Efforts to combat the disease focus on large-scale vector control programs, blood donor screenings, and surveillance (182, 189). development of a vaccine or new, cost-effective antiprotozoal drugs is critical for management of the disease (34). an acute, progressive encephalitis caused by a group of RNA viruses that has close to a 100% mortality rate if left untreated (200) rabies is caused by members of the genus Lyssavirus in the family Rhabdoviridae and is generally spread via contact with infected animal saliva (7). greater than 15 million people each year are given specific postexposure treatment, but there are still an estimated 50,000 annual rabies deaths worldwide, mostly in africa and Asia (7 treatment is effective, with an estimated 270,000 lives saved due to effective postexposure prophylaxis among worldwide rabies cases. the highest risk for rabies incidence occurs in the poor in regions such as africa, Asia, and Latin America. enzootic bat lyssaviruses are being detected in previously uncommon animal reservoirs. fox-to-dog transmission of rabies has occurred following widespread vaccination efforts. international animal trade poses a largely unchecked and significant potential for rabies zoonotic disease spread (7, 219, 220, 223\u2013227) human cysticercosis is an infectious disease caused by the ingestion of eggs of the pork tapeworm, Taenia solium, through fecal-oral transmission (233, 234) this typically occurs through a 2-host life cycle where the intermediate host (pigs) ingests food or water contaminated by eggs excreted in the feces of humans infected with the adult tapeworm, which then disseminate and mature into the larval stage in the tissue of pigs and this EReNTD is most recognized as a public health crisis in sub-saharan africa (7). it has been associated with poverty in populations within high-income countries and poorer populations in areas of endemicity. this EReNTD is even more challenging as a public health concern because little reliable epidemiological information is available. two recombinant antigens for Taenia solium shown to be 98.6% and 99.9% effective at protecting pigs from infection after oral administration of T. solium eggs. these results were replicated in several different field trials in rural Mexico, an area of endemicity. T. b. rhodesiense is responsible for the majority of cases and occurs in west and central africa. the transmission cycle involves humans as the reservoir for the parasite and the tsetse fly acting as both a disease host and a vector for human-human transmission. domestic and wild animals can become infected with both parasitic subspecies. common symptoms after transmission include fever, headache, pain and weakness in joints, and severe neurological and psychiatric disorders. the disease can also cause amenorrhea, sterility, and abortion and can be contracted congenitally. early screening, case detection, diagnosis, and treatment are critical strategies in the clinical management of this potentially fatal disease. the negative socioeconomic impact of HAT is particularly severe due to the devastating physical and mental disabilities associated with disease progression, particularly in the late stage. children engaged in activities that lead to increased exposure to the disease vector can also experience problems in growth and intellectual development that can lead to learning retardation and loss of future labor resources. the disease's long incubation period in the T. b. gambiense subspecies can lead to importation into regions where it is not endemic. it has been reported as increasing in a number of cases in regions where it is not endemic. these common risk factors include vector-related risk factors, disease-related risks, drug treatment and development challenges. EReNTDs are characterized by a broad array of risk factors also associated with EIDs/ReIDs. this includes societal and human behavioral influences, changes in population demographics, food production, spread through international travel. this includes similar concerns for developing antimicrobial resistance, such as developing resistance to insecticides from vector control measures. EReNTDs are notable for their significant negative economic impacts on afflicted, poorer rural communities, tremendous morbidity and mortality exacerbated by poverty and social determinants of health. the prevention of spread of EReNTDs, as primarily zoonotic diseases, is heavily dependent on strategic integrated vector control strategies. this dependence on vector control is due to the frequent lack of access to safe or effective treatment. no EReNTDs have an approved vaccine, with exception of targeted preexposure rabies immunization in both animals and humans (8). vaccine development for other infectious diseases may have potential, including the bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin vaccine for tuberculosis. a critical area of need for many EReNTDs is continued investment, innovation, and development. the quality of NTD medicines has come into question as part of larger global concerns regarding the ongoing public health problem of counterfeit, falsified, and substandard medicines in low-resource settings. concerns regarding possible substandard medicines have arisen from the detection of locally manufactured miltefosine (used to treat visceral leishmaniasis) that contained no active ingredient in Bangladesh. the global distribution of endemic EReNTDs is shown in Fig. 2. the list of EIDs and ReIDs compiled by the CDC and NIH may grow as new diseases emerge and emerge. common risk factors include vector-related risk factors, disease-related risks, drug treatment and development challenges, social determinants of health-related risk factors, and disease control-related challenges. EReNTD common risk factors Risk factor or challenge Vector-related risk factors Complex stages of disease exposure and transmission through animal vectors that act as intermediary hosts Present in a variety of different animal vectors. EReNTDs are characterized by a broad array of risk factors also associated with EIDs/ReIDs. this includes changes in population demographics, food production, spread through international travel, and environmental and ecological changes. this includes similar concerns for developing antimicrobial resistance, such as developing resistance to insecticides from vector control measures. communities impacted by EReNTDs often lack the infrastructure to support integrated prevention and treatment approaches. ensuring clinics in areas of endemicity are adequately stocked with medications that are low-cost and accessible may encourage infected individuals to seek care. ensuring clinics in areas of endemicity are adequately stocked with medications that are low-cost and accessible may encourage infected individuals to seek care. the bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin vaccine for tuberculosis has been found to offer limited, temporary protection from the bacterium that causes leprosy. the successful utilization of existing vaccines used for other infectious diseases may provide another method for encouraging EReNTD research and innovation. a critical area of need for many EReNTDs is continued investment, innovation, and development. high-income countries have emitted a much larger amount of greenhouse gases than lower-income countries. residents of lower-income countries whose health is often most directly impacted by the NTD health-related consequences of climate change (311) list of EIDs and ReIDs compiled by the CDC and NIH may grow as new diseases emerge/reemerge. other NTDs may also be subject to epidemiological or geographical shifts, transformations through genetic mutation, or changes in host/vector distribution. these developments may portend a greater potential for regional spread in areas where the diseases are not endemic. prevention and control of NTDs associated with food-borne illnesses, water supply and sanitation issues, and environmental issues.

NTD initiatives include direct government-, industry-, or private foundation-led initiatives such as the u.s. agency for international development's NTD Program, Merck's partnership on onchocerciasis, Pfizer's partnership with the international Trachoma Initiative, and the BMGF-led Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative. other organizations have attempted to tackle specific EReNTDs. all endorse a renewed focused on the control or elimination of at least 10 NTDs by the end of the decade through international partnership and cooperation (36, 45). this monumental declaration included commitments by stakeholders to expand drug access programs and other interventions; advance NTD treatment R&D through partnerships and funding. this specifically included financial commitments from pharmaceutical firms for US$1.4 billion in NTD treatments, $363 million from the BMGF. one health initiatives can serve as an important potential model for effective EReNTD interventions. they have previously been proposed as a model integrated approach to preventing pandemic-scale zoonotic infectious disease threats. they should leverage partners and broader global public health networks. potential UN agency cooperation under a One Health framework for EReNTDs could take a leading role in their respective areas of focus. potential framework could include the WHO special programme for research and training in tropical diseases (TDR) with its history of public-private engagement. incentives offered through IPRs may not be sufficient to provide access to life-saving medicines despite their necessity and demand. incentives offered through IPRs may not be sufficient to provide access to life-saving medicines despite their necessity and demand, leading to market failure. concept would create foundation of new global health governance architecture for innovation under a proposed WHO treaty instrument that prioritizes global health needs-driven research. core to the treaty is the requirement that national governments have a legal obligation to provide a minimum investment in R&D through a centralized global financing structure ensuring sustainable financing. a proposal for a global multistakeholder partnership modeled after the Global Fund has been suggested for NTDs. the global fund has emerged as a leading global health institution, funding mechanism, and successful large-scale PPP model. this model has led to major advances in combating HIV/AIDS, malaria, and TB. prize funds act as pull mechanisms for R&D by providing financial incentives for successful drug development. this includes proposals for fixed awards, milestone requirements to space out payments, and prize amounts based on outcome measures such as impact on DALYs. prize funds seek to delink R&D costs from the end price of the final product, often by including IPR management requirements. extended drug market exclusivity provisions under orphan drug legislation have been proposed as a possible mechanism to incentivize NTD drug R&D. common incentive mechanisms in existing orphan drug legislation include fast-track regulatory processes, protocol assistance for clinical trials, tax credits, exemption of registration fees, and access to research grants. TDs and other drug development for diseases that impact the poor and underserved. this could be accomplished by reducing or eliminating tax-based incentives for development of drugs that may be of lower global health need. this could be accomplished by reducing or eliminating tax-based incentives for development of drugs that may be of lower global health need. universities Allied for Essential Medicines (UAEM) has acted as the primary advocate for these practices and has developed its own framework of principles on how institutional global access policies should be implemented. universities allied for essential medicines (UAEM) has highlighted NTDs as a programmatic priority and in 2010 held a Neglected Disease and Innovation Symposium. open-access model can leverage growing published data on sequenced genomes of organisms associated with NTDs. open-source drug discovery can have potential to advance screening and identifying potential protein targets/compounds/new chemical entities for drug discovery, target existing drugs, enable more collaboration involving researchers in developed and developing countries, and potentially lower drug discovery-associated costs. the WHO-led CEWG on research and development assessed a number of different proposals in this area. all of the four CEWG-recommended demonstration projects address NTDs. the recommended demonstration projects include submissions from DNDi, the Medicines for Malaria Venture, the U.S. FDA and others. a number of intellectual property rights (IPRs) recognized under international agreements are employed. patents (typically granted for new chemical entities, molecules, or biological preparations), data exclusivity (surrounding data generated when potential new drugs undergo clinical trials), market exclusivity (when new drugs are granted exclusive marketing rights by a drug regulatory agency, generally developed for government-identified priority areas) the establishment of an international binding biomedical treaty has been suggested as a potential policy since 2004. this concept would create the foundation of a new global health governance architecture for innovation under a proposed WHO treaty instrument. the treaty requires national governments to provide a minimum investment in R&D through a centralized global financing structure ensuring sustainable financing. the global fund for NTDs has emerged as a leading global health institution, funding mechanism, and successful large-scale PPP model. the global fund has attracted billions of dollars in financing and led to major advances in combating HIV/AIDS, malaria, and TB. prize funds act as pull mechanisms for R&D by providing financial incentives for successful drug development. prize funds seek to delink R&D costs from the end price of the final product. these programs often end up paying premiums to offset potential investment failures. extended drug market exclusivity provisions under orphan drug legislation have been proposed as a possible mechanism to incentivize NTD drug R&D given its relative success in promoting development of drugs for rare diseases. orphan disease designation for NTDs has been used only a few times, and generally such incentives rely upon small biotechnology firms in niche markets rather than large multinational pharmaceutical manufacturers for utilization. a global policy proposal has suggested more targeted use and coordination of national R&D tax credits and lowering of trade and tariff barriers for NTD-related commodities. some governments have applied this approach by providing additional tax credits to incentivize infectious disease research. the policy proposal would reform national tax codes for pharmaceutical expenditures by requiring prequalification of incentives. this could be accomplished by reducing or eliminating tax-based incentives for development of drugs that may be of lower global health need. socially responsible licensing principles often include establishing \u201cequitable access licensing\u201d policies at the institutional level, requiring nonexclusive and open licensing for developing countries and/or NTD innovation in technology transfer. licensing requiring at-cost production and sale of a novel drugs to treat leishmaniasis in developing countries. open-source drug discovery and development models are a relatively new and innovative strategy focused on encouraging collaboration, sharing, and dissemination of research outcomes. open-source collaborations in science and medicine have led to well-known advancements, including human genome sequencing and open-source software (e.g., the Linux operating system) regional open-source drug discovery NTD initiatives are under way. regional open-source drug discovery NTD initiatives are also under way. andi's primary goal is to promote africa-led health product innovation to address public health needs under regional governance and management. the recommended demonstration projects have met with some criticism, specifically that they lack novelty in favor of projects deemed more viable (e.g., low-risk), many of which are already under way. the emphasis on innovation for NTDs provides further evidence of raising global awareness and urgency for the need of tangible action. obtaining member state agreement to binding treaty terms will likely prove difficult, even though modification of these trade and IPR agreements to accommodate the proposal has been suggested. only one health treaty has ever been established under the auspices of the normative powers of the WHO Constitution. the steps and political will required to create an \u201cNTD Global Fund\u201d are still underdeveloped. possible strategies include expanding the current Global Fund's mandate to include NTD control and elimination. there has also been a related proposal advocating for a \u201csocial offset\u201d mechanism in NTD funding that would set aside resources for NTD related socio-environmental and health system issues. AMCs and prize funds require complex balancing of R&D cost calculations and future medication prices to ensure affordability for resource-poor populations. they ultimately rely on negotiation/agreement with industry partners, which can be extremely time-consuming and labor-intensive as well as heavily biased toward industry repeat players. drug development through orphan drug laws has been criticized because it provides private-sector benefits in the form of market exclusivity without ensuring patient access or affordability. this approach is particularly risky for resource-poor countries, whose drug regulatory systems and authorizers may be unable to adequately control or obtain price concessions. incentivize elements of NTD funding and ensuring affordable access to NTD treatments by lowering prices. tax incentives through credits and subsidies do not guarantee that pharmaceutical firms will engage in NTD R&D if those drugs are unprofitable and cannot be used by firms that are operating at a financial loss. institutions that have adopted related policies include the University of British Columbia, Emory University, the University of California Berkeley, Boston University, the University of Edinburgh, and Oxford University (360, 365). barriers to more universal adoption include concerns about the negative financial impact of socially responsible licensing policies on institutions as well as industry concerns about diversion or reimportation of generic formulations back into developed countries. NTD drug development is at the forefront of the open-source drug discovery movement. this includes the tropical disease initiative (TDI), which provides a decentralized, web-based, open-source environment for volunteer collaboration on NTD drug discovery. other open-access resources for NTD development include TDRtargets.org, which provides genetic, biochemical, and pharmacological data and computational predictive models. all of the four CEWG-recommended demonstration projects address NTDs. they focus on innovation, development, access to therapy for visceral leishmaniasis, open-access/source drug discovery for a range of NTD compound candidates, and development of affordable biomarkers for use in diagnostics for four parasitic NTDs. these diseases have the potential to emerge/reemerge while remaining neglected in the global health priority setting. there remains a dearth of necessary diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics needed to help populations affected by these terrible diseases. global public health policies and interventions that hope to tackle the unique threats posed by these diseases need to be integrated and innovative."}
