{"summary": "monoclonal antibodies have been the dominant agents in biomedical research since they were introduced in 1975. oligonucleotide aptamers have become the most promising agents to compete with antibodies in diagnostics but also in therapeutics. aptamers are short (20\u201370 bases) single stranded oligonucleotides which bind to their targets through 3D conformational complementarities with high affinity and specificity. pegaptanib, an aptamer against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), has been successfully used in market [8,9,10,11] it opens a wide window for the following development of more therapeutic oligonucleotide aptamers. in this review, we will explain the advantages and limitations of oligonucleotide aptamers from the aspects of immunogenicity, production, cost and stability. pegaptanib, the first aptamer approved by the FDA for treating wet AMD, showed no immunogenicity in either preclinical evaluation in animals or clinical trials in patients. aptamers can be easily but accurately synthesized by chemical methods, so production of large quantities of aptamers is less expensive and less risky. the successful rate of effective aptamer identification by conventional in vitro aptamer selection methods is lower than 30%. the successful rate of effective aptamer identification by conventional in vitro aptamer selection methods is lower than 30%. anti-thrombin aptamer and antibody conjugation that bind to different epitopes of thrombin have been designed. anti-thrombin antibody and anti-thrombin aptamer bind to different sites to thrombin. conjugation of antibody and aptamer (AAP) has 100 and 35 fold higher affinity to thrombin than antibody and aptamer alone, respectively. aptamer loaded with Dox has approximately three- and six-fold higher cytotoxicity than Dox alone and antibody alone. aptamer E10010 combined with anti-VEGF antibody ranibizumab shows higher therapeutic potency than antibody alone for wet AMD treatment. the combination therapeutics of anti-PDGF antibody with anti-VEGF aptamer also has promising therapeutic effects. there is no aptamer with high immunogenicity reported till now. antibodies have an indefinite shelf life and require a continuous cold chain during transportation to avoid denaturation. the function of aptamers could be regenerated easily even if they are denatured. aptamers display distinct advantages over monoclonal antibodies in both diagnostic and therapeutic applications. anti-thrombin aptamer and antibody conjugation bind to different sites to thrombin. anti-thrombin antibody and anti-thrombin aptamer bind to different sites to thrombin. anti-thrombin antibody and anti-thrombin aptamer have been designed. anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) aptamer was conjugated with anti-HER2 antibody by same conjugation method (AAP) then loaded with doxorubicin (AAP-Dox) folding of the aptamer changes when aptamer binds to HER2 then dox will be released from AAP-Dox. aptamer E10010 combined with anti-VEGF antibody ranibizumab shows higher therapeutic potency than antibody alone all random ssDNA/RNAs have one conserved sequence at each end. the length of the random sequence is normally 20\u201340 bases. the number of sequences in the whole library would be 1012\u20131015. the first step is to incubate target proteins with the random library. the second step is to incubate target proteins with the random library. counter (negative) SELEX is usually performed after positive SELEX to exclude aptamers which bind to negative targets to discriminate highly similar structures. aptamers that specifically recognized osteoblasts but did not enter hepatocytes and peripheral blood cells were successfully developed for targeted delivery of therapeutic siRNA [24] this counter SELEX strategy could effectively decrease adverse effects caused by off-target phenomenon in vivo. aptamers in four rounds Cell SELEX Select against whole cells No prior target knowledge required In vivo SELEX generate aptamers in living organisms No prior target knowledge required Suitable for cancer therapy as tumors have high varieties and in vitro selection may not work In silico SELEX Employ computational docking Could be used to predict aptamer affinity, specificity, 3D structure and aptamer-target interaction by computer. different sequences of ssDNA/RNA are shown in different color. different sequences of ssDNA/RNA are shown in different color. Modifications of Aptamers for preclinical studies. terminal 3\u2032\u20133\u2032 and 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 internucleotide linkage was first tried in 1991. a sense deoxyoligonucleotide capping of both ends of the aptamer with inverted thymidine could increase stability significantly but also slowed nuclease degradation from 30 min (unmodified) down to 90 min (modified) in snake venom phosphodiesterase digestion. l-RNA l-form, PEGylated Phase II on-going 5.2.2 Coagulation REG1 Coagulation factor IXa RNA 3\u2032-inverted dT, PEGylated Phase III await 5.3.1 ARC1779 von Willebrand factor (vWF) A1 domain DNA 3\u2032-inverted dT, PEGylated Phase II on-going 5.3.2 NU172 Thrombin DNA Unmodified DNA Phase II on-going 5. cholODN-LDL complex has high stability and is highly resistant to nucleases degradation in serum. phosphodiester linkage of DNA with methylphosphonate or phosphorothioate is also commonly used for aptamer stabilization. l-form oligonucleotides (Spiegelmer) are chiral inversions of natural d-forms. unlocked nucleic acid (UNA) is an opposite modification to LNA. there is a bond between C2\u2032 and C3\u2032 missing in UNA. replacement on a loop region of an anti-thrombin aptamer increased its themostability while replacement on G-tetrads disrupted the structure formation. sequences that bind to target proteins are separated from those that do not bind. a single cycle of SELEX is completed, which would obtain only a small number of binding sequences. the binding sequences are then transformed into bacteria (E. coli) for further sequencing as well as characterization. aptamers that specifically recognized osteoblasts but did not enter hepatocytes and peripheral blood cells were successfully developed for targeted delivery of therapeutic siRNA [23,24]. this counter SELEX strategy could effectively decrease adverse effects caused by off-target phenomenon in vivo. for example, drug resistance was frequently found in breast cancer patients when treating with monoclonal antibodies against HER2. could be used to predict aptamer affinity, specificity, 3D structure and aptamer-target interaction. could identify aptamers in two to three rounds of SELEX. could perform comprehensive characterization of identified aptamers. the method used to develop specific aptamers is a process called SELEX. the first step is synthesis of a screening library, which contains a large number of randomly combinatorial ssDNA and/or ssRNA. the length of the random sequence is normally 20\u201340 bases so the number of sequences in the whole library would be 1012\u20131015. different sequences of ssDNA/RNA are shown in different color. the successful rate of effective aptamer identification by conventional SELEX is lower than 30%. aptamers identified from conventional SELEX process which have high specificity may fail to stimulate or inhibit their targets as expected. counter (negative) SELEX is usually performed after positive SELEX to exclude aptamers which bind to negative targets to discriminate highly similar structures. SELEX Introduce negative selection to exclude aptamers bind to negative target Could discriminate highly similar structure to increase specificity Toggle SELEX Multiple positive selection targets Could select aptamers bind to multiple targets Capillary electrophoresis-SELEX Separate aptamer\u2013target complexes from free aptamers according to their electrophoretic mobility with capillary electrophoresis Could effectively identify high affinity aptamers. high affinity aptamers are then cloned and sequenced. this technique can dramatically increase the successful rate of aptamer selection. different sequences of ssDNA/RNA are shown in different color. aptamers against various targets have a G-quadruplex structure with high sequence identity with high diversity. another group tried to invert 5\u2032\u20135\u2032 of a polarity site to form a folded aptamer with a non-common structure d(GGTTGGTGTGGTTGG). this structure has higher stability and affinity to thrombin, although lower inhibiting activity compared to unmodified aptamers. cancer AS1411 Nucleolin RNA G-rich, PEGylated Phase II on-going 5.2.1 NOX-A12 The chemokine (C\u2013X\u2013C motif) ligand 12 (CXCL-12) l-RNA l-form, PEGylated Phase III on-going 5.2.2 Coagulation REG1 Coagulation factor IXa RNA 3\u2032-inverted dT, PEGylated Phase II on-going 5.3.2 NU anti-SARS coronavirus helicase aptamer can remain intact for up to 16 h in 10% fetal bovine serum compared to 6 h for unmodified aptamers. cholesterol can be added to the 5\u2032-end of an aptamer to form a cholesteryl-oligonucleotide (cholODN) and further linked to low density lipoprotein (LDL) to form a compact cholODN-LDL modification on a sugar ring with a methylene linkage between 2\u2032-O and 4\u2032-C. unlocked nucleic acid (UNA) is an opposite modification to LNA. it is found that replacement on an anti-thrombin aptamer increased its themostability while replacement on G-tetrads disrupted structure formation. G-quadruplex structure formed by two stacking G-tetrads and a central loop TGT which is optimal for stability. adding an extra guanine at the 5\u2032 end caused decreased stability while adding an extra guanine to the 3\u2032 end caused increased stability. it was found that the mostability of an aptamer is sequence dependent. helial growth factor (VEGF) RNA 2\u2032-fluoro pyrimidines, 2\u2032-O-methyl purines, 3\u2032-inverted dT, PEGylated Approved for age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD) 5.1.1 ARC1905 Complement component 5 RNA 3\u2032-inverted dT, PEGylated Phase I completed 5.1.2 E10030 Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) DNA 2\u2032-fluor anti-SARS coronavirus helicase aptamer can remain intact for up to 16 h in 10% fetal bovine serum compared to 6 h for unmodified aptamers. cholesterol can be added to the 5\u2032-end of an aptamer to form a cholesteryl-oligonucleotide (cholODN) and further linked to low density lipoprotein (LDL) aptamers noX-A12, NOX-H94 and NOX-E36 are all l-form aptamers. unlocked nucleic acid (LNA) is a modification on a sugar ring with a methylene linkage between 2\u2032-O and 4\u2032-C. it can generate the most stable pairs to dramatically increase the nucleases resistance of aptamers. the number of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) is decreased through aging while increased through adipocyte differentiation. miR-188 level is much higher in BMSCs in old than in young mice and human. an aptamer that specifically recognizes BMSCs is developed and conjugated with miR-188 to form a nanocomplex. there are 11 aptamers evaluating in clinical trials for the treatment of macular degeneration, cancer, inflammation and coagulation. one of them has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of AMD. there are three aptamers being evaluated for wet or dry AMD therapy. aptamer pegaptanib is the first aptamer approved for use in human. it inhibits VEGF165 isoforms, while antibodies inhibit all isoforms of VEGF. aptamer pegaptanib failed to compete with anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody ranibizumab. a phase I clinical trial using ARC1905 in combination with ranibizumab for the treatment of wet AMD (NCT00709527) was finished in 2011. a phase I clinical for dry AMD treatment (NCT00950638) has recently been completed. 5.1.3. E10030 It may not be sufficient to inhibit VEGF only for wet AMD treatment to prevent angiogenesis due to the limit of new vessels regression associated with vision loss. combination therapy targeting two different antigens at the same time using aptamer-aptamer combination or aptamer-antibody combination could be a new therapeutic direction in future study. monoclonal antibodies can recognize targeting tumor cells with high specificity but are difficult to penetrate into the deep sites of tumor cells due to the large size. AS1411 can inhibit over 80 types of cancer cells in in vitro studies. it is the first oligonucleotide aptamer approved for clinical trial for human cancer therapy. in phase I clinical trial, AS1411 is well tolerated by patients with advanced cancers. l-form aptamers can not be recognized by nucleases, it does not require any chemical modifications for in vivo studies. phase I clinical trial for safety and tolerability evaluation confirms NOX-A12 can be well tolerated without serious adverse effects. patients with NOX-A12 treatment are more susceptible to chemotherapy due to its particular blockage of stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) phase I clinical trials have shown REG1 is well tolerated in patients. no significant adverse effects or major bleeding are found after percutaneous coronary intervention. a later randomized clinical trial had to be terminated before it finished. cynomolgus monkey could be prevented from interleukin-6 induced iron concentration decrease in serum. cynomolgus monkey could be prevented from interleukin-6 induced iron concentration decrease in serum when treated with NOX-H94. the target of NOX-E36 is chemokine ligand 2 (also called monocyte chemoattractant protein 1). it can mediate inflammation by recruiting leukocytes from intravascular to extravascular environments. aptamers against macular degeneration wet (neovascular) and dry (atrophic) AMD are two major causes of vision loss in the elderly. inhibits VEGF165 with high affinity and efficacy is chosen and modified with 2\u2032-fluoro pyrimidines and 2\u2032-O-methyl purines. a 40 kDa polyethylene glycol (PEG) is conjugated to the 5\u2032- end of the RNA aptamer to increase half life of the aptamer for better bioavailability. aptamer pegaptanib failed to compete with anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody ran a phase I clinical trial using ARC1905 in combination with ranibizumab for the treatment of wet AMD (NCT00709527) was finished in 2011 and a phase I clinical for dry AMD treatment (NCT00950638) has recently been completed. combination treatment using pegaptanib and anti-PDGF antibody can not only prevent new vessel formation but also promote vessel regression. combination therapy targeting two different antigens at the same time using aptamer-aptamer combination or aptamer-antibody combination could be a new therapeutic direction in future study. pegaptanib is selected directly against VEGF165, the VEGF isoform primarily responsible for pathological ocular neovasculariztion. aptamer pegaptanib failed to compete with anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody ranibizumab (Lucentis; Genentech, South San Francisco, California, USA) as it only inhibits VEGF165 isoforms, while antibodies inhibit all isoforms of VEGF [57] blocking all activity of VEGF may cause high risk of hypertension and other adverse effects. aptamer pegaptanib is better than antibody ranibizumab in long combination treatment using pegaptanib and anti-PDGF antibody also has promising therapeutic effect. combination therapy targeting two different antigens at the same time using aptamer-aptamer combination could be a new therapeutic direction in future study. aptamers with much smaller size (around 30 kDa) can diffuse into tumors in 10 min after injection. for example, a fluorescent aptamer against extracellular matrix protein tenascin-C was able to diffuse into tumors rapidly with perivascular fluorescence signal detected in tumor only 10 min after intravenous injection. another group has compared the tumor penetration times between aptamer and antibody, and found that they were detected in tumors after 10 min and 3 phase II clinical trial shows therapeutic efficacy to acute myeloid leukemia patients without toxicity and adverse effects. however, a following phase II evaluation for renal cell carcinoma found AS1411 only has therapeutic effect in 2.9% of patients. NOX-A12 NOX-A12 is a 45-mer l-RNA aptamer developed for use in autologous stem cell transplants. AS1411 is a guanine-rich aptamer with G-quadruplex structure. it is highly stable and resistant to nuclease degradation. it is the first oligonucleotide aptamer approved for clinical trial for human cancer therapy. NOX-A12 is a 45-mer l-RNA aptamer developed for use in autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplants. it targets to stroma cell-derived factor-1 The chemokine (C\u2013X\u2013C motif) ligand 12 (CXCL-12), which plays important roles in stem cell migration towards the bone marrow and controls tumor growth, metastasis and vasculogenesis. REG1 REG1 is an aptamer system consisting of a 37-mer RNA aptamer RB006 (Pegnivacogin) and a 17-mer antidote RB007 with sequence complementary to RB006. RB006 is an antagonist of factor IXa for preventing downstream conversion of factor X and avoidance of clotting. ARC1779 inhibits platelet depletion induced by a vWF agonist desmopressin in patients. phase II clinical trial for VWF 2D treatment is still on-going. NU172 Aptamer NU172 (ARCA Biopharma, London, UK) is an unmodified DNA aptamer for short-term anticoagulation. RB007 is the antidote of factor IXa for preventing the downstream conversion of factor X and avoidance of clotting. phase I clinical trials have shown REG1 is well tolerated in patients. no significant adverse effects or major bleeding are found. NU172 Aptamer NU172 (ARCA Biopharma, London, UK) is an unmodified DNA aptamer for short-term anticoagulation and is distinct from the long-term anticoagulation aptamer REG1 and ARC1779. in preclinical studies, NU172 showed efficacy to prolong clotting time and the anticoagulation effect would be stopped rapidly due to nuclease degradation. cynomolgus monkey could be prevented from interleukin-6 induced iron concentration decrease in serum when treated with NOX-H94. clinical trials for treatment of erythropoiesis agent-induced anemia in patients with dialysis are still in progress. cynomolgus monkey could be prevented from interleukin-6 induced iron concentration decrease in serum when treated with NOX-H94. clinical trials for treatment of erythropoiesis agent-induced anemia are still in progress. NOX-E36 is another l-form anti-inflammation aptamer from Noxxon. monoclonal antibodies approved by the FDA for therapeutic use. oligonucleotide aptamers can be identified against the same targets. this would save considerable research effort and allow more rapid progress in developing more economic and efficient therapeutic approaches. chronic lymphocytic leukemia Ibritomomab Zevalin 90Y CD20 B-cell non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma Adalimumab Trudexa TNF Crohn\u2019s disease and arthritis Alefacept Amevive CD2 Chronic plaque psoriasis Omalizumab Xolair IgE asthema Tositumomab Bexxar CD20 CD20-positive B- b (CNTO 136) IL-6 Rheumatoid arthritis."}
