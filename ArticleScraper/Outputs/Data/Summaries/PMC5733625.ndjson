{"summary": "human infection with novel influenza A viruses, including variant influenza viruses, is notifiable conditions. we identified H3N2v cases as part of national influenza surveillance. we encouraged increased respiratory specimen collection and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing. at the CDC, H3N2v virus in all respiratory specimens was confirmed by rRT-PCR testing. amplified RNA of a subset of specimens also underwent full genome sequencing or partial genome sequencing. we assessed susceptibility to antiviral medications by phenotypic neuraminidase inhibition assays on viral isolates. for 297 (97%) cases for which information was available, the median duration between the date of illness onset and the date that case information was entered into the secure CDC database was 5 days (range, 1\u201324 days) the median duration between the date of illness onset and the date that case information was entered into the secure CDC database was 5 days (range, 1\u201324 days) the number of cases reported in each state may exceed the number linked to fairs, as not all patients reported fair attendance prior to illness onset. the median age of all patients was 7 years (range, 3 months to 74 years), and 92% were aged 18 years; 47% were male. 1 y 7 (2.2) 1\u20134 y 93 (30) 5\u201311 y 152 (50) 12\u201317 y 31 (10) 18\u201349 y 18 (6) 50 y 5 (1.6) Race (n = 288) White 279 (97) Black 3 (1.0) Asian 3 (1.0) Multiracial 3 (1.0) Ethnicity (n = 235) Non-Hispanic 227 (97) Signs and symptoms Fever/feverishness 294/ 234 individuals reporting swine contact prior to illness onset were associated with direct (69%) or indirect (26%) swine contact prior to illness onset. the mean duration between the last date of swine exposure and illness onset was 2.91. the estimated number of agricultural fairs occurring in the united states peaked at 320 during the week of 22 July 2012, approximately 1 week prior to the peak of the epidemic curve depicting illness onset of cases. the median age of the 16 hospitalized patients was 5 years (range, 11 months to 61 years); 14 of them were aged 18 years; 7 (44%) were aged 5 years (Table 3). pulmonary hypertension, asthma 8 5 M 2 d Recovered Previously healthy 11 6 F 3 d Recovered Previously healthy 12 6 F 3 d Recovered Previously healthy 13 7 F 1 d Recovered Lymphocytic leukemia 14 12 F 1 d Recovered Multiple myeloma 16 61 F 1 d Died Diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, hypertension We identified 15 cases of possible person-to-person transmission of H3N2v virus three siblings had swine exposure on 28 July and illness onsets 30 July, 1 Aug, and 2 Aug; none were tested for influenza. all had swine exposure and none were tested for influenza. the 126 viruses that were sequenced were 93%\u2013100% identical in all genes, with the most diversity seen in the NA gene. genetic sequencing results and data from phenotypic NA inhibition assays conducted on 117 isolates indicated that all H3N2v viruses examined were susceptible to NA inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir. this is consistent with reports from 2011, which described 3 instances (comprising 6 cases) among 12 cases of H3N2v virus infection in which person-to-person transmission was suspected. increased prevalence of underlying medical conditions among the single fatality and 16 hospitalized patients in this outbreak underscores the importance of treatment and prevention strategies. the high prevalence of cases among children is consistent with the susceptibility profile of this H3N2v virus seen in literature describing a relative increase in cross-protective immunity in persons approximately 10 years or older. this large outbreak may have been the result of a confluence of a highly susceptible population exposed to a readily transmissible influenza virus at agricultural fairs with swine exhibits. a distinguishing characteristic of this outbreak was direct contact with swine on multiple days prior to illness onset. in this outbreak, the majority of patients reported direct contact with swine, contrast to recent reports of H3N2v2 and H1N1v1. nearly two-thirds of patients in this outbreak reported swine exposure on >1 day and more than one-quarter reported daily exposure during the week preceding illness onset. it is possible that we would be more likely to identify a patient with H3N2v infection in the summer than during the typical influenza season, amidst the \u201cnoise\u201d of seasonal influenza cases. the 2012\u20132013 influenza season did not begin until mid-November, 2 months after the outbreak was thought to have ended. seasonal influenza vaccination may offer only minimal protection against H3N2v viruses. despite enhanced surveillance for ILI in states where H3N2v cases were identified, only 15 instances where person-to-person transmission was suspected. swine contact at an agricultural fair was a key risk factor for infection. infrequent cases of limited person-to-person H3N2v transmission indicate that person-to-person spread of this virus is possible. two H3N2v cases were identified in 2012 after 7 September."}
