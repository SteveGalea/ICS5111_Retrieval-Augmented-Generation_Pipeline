{"summary": "recurrence of pandemics since the mid-eighteenth century indicates that pandemics occur about every 30 years [1]. previous influenza pandemics and the current H1N1 swine influenza pandemic arrived with little to no warning. a key component to the public's response is their perception of risk. women and older respondents scored significantly higher on a composite measure of risk perception than men and younger respondents. in an italian population, di Giuseppe et al. [10] found that risk perception was higher for respondents with lower socioeconomic status and lower education. in preparation for a pandemic influenza outbreak, the Australian government recommends a number of measures the general public could take. up to 7 calls were made to establish initial contact with a household. 5 calls were made in order to contact a selected respondent. only residential phone numbers were used in the sample. Combined indicator (1): pandemic influenza likely to occur + Concern for self/family + Changed way of living. Combined indicator (2): pandemic influenza likely to occur + Concern for self/family + Changed way of living. possible responses were \u201call of the time\u201d, \u201cmost of the time\u201d, \u201ca little of the time\u201d and \u201cnone of the time\u201d. a score below 22 was considered as low-psychological distress, and a score of 22 or above was considered as high-psychological distress. Combined indicator (1): pandemic influenza likely to occur + Concern for self/family Combined indicator (2): pandemic influenza likely to occur + Concern for self/family + Changed way of living. the K10 provides a score ranging from 10\u201350. a score below 22 was considered as low-psychological distress. a score of 22 or above was considered as high-psychological distress. self/family, Changed life, combined indicator (1) and combined indicator (2).
