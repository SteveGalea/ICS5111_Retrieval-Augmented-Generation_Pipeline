{"summary": "pentacyclic triterpenoid compounds oleanolic acid (OA) and glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) are distributed widely in nature. the in vitro anticancer activities of new OA and GA derivatives were tested using the combination principle. about 17.5 million cancer cases were detected and 8.7 million deaths occurred in 2015 worldwide. in the u.s., 1,688,780 new cancer cases and 600,920 cancer deaths were projected to occur in 2017. recently developed anticancer drugs with higher inhibitory activity and strong selectivity. some studies have found that OA and GA have a broad inhibitory effect on the growth of many tumor cell lines in vitro. some studies have found that OA and GA have a broad inhibitory effect on the growth of many tumor cell lines in vitro by inducing tumor cell autophagy and apoptosis. OH position of the OA ester and GA ester, and synthesized 20 new OA and GA derivatives, of which 18 new compounds were the target products. we used five cancer cell lines to determine the antitumor activity and human skin fibroblasts (HSF) as a control. the organic phase was washed with water and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, followed by suction filtration and concentration to obtain
