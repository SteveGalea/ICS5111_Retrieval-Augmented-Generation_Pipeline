{"summary": "intercept blood systemTM (Cerus) is used to inactivate pathogens in platelet concentrates (PC) the study was designed to elucidate the extent to which the Intercept treatment modifies the functional properties of platelets. CAD and UV illumination alone make negligible contributions to the changes in aggregation observed in intercept-treated PC. the emergence of new pathogens and the risk of bacterial contamination of platelet concentrates remain major concerns when trying to guarantee the safety of platelet transfusions1. clinical trials of Intercept were too heterogeneous with regards to 1 hour corrected count increments to reach any conclusion. however, a reassessment of the bleeding rates did not show any difference between Intercept-treated and control platelets23. there are discrepancies in the published data. whole blood units (45050 mL +63 mL citrate-phosphate-dextrose) were collected (day 0) in a quadruple bag system (NGR6428B, Fenwal, lake Zurich, IL, USA) and kept at 22 \u00b0C overnight. five ABO-matched buffy coats (60 mL, haematocrit 0.4, from donors who had not been taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) were manually poole the treated PC was transferred to the final storage bag (1,300 mL, PL2410 plastic) under agitation at 22 \u00b0C. three ABO-matched PC were pooled and split into four identical products. the third PC was directly incubated with the CAD for 14 hours. FFP-diluted platelets were set at 0% aggregation before addition of the agonist. 300 L AB-group FFP was set at 100% aggregation. diluted platelets were agitated for 5 minutes at room temperature. HEPES-Tyrode\u2019s buffer and the wells supplemented with 150 L of 0.1M citrate buffer (pH 5.4) containing 5 mM p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma, S0942) and 0.1% Triton X-100 (Fluka [Buchs, Switzerland], 93420) after incubation for 1 hour at 37 \u00b0C, the reaction was stopped with 100 L of 2.5 M sodium hydroxide. whole blood units (45050 mL +63 mL citrate-phosphate-dextrose) were collected (day 0) in a quadruple bag system (NGR6428B, Fenwal, lake Zurich, IL, USA) and kept at 22 \u00b0C overnight. five ABO-matched buffy coats (60 mL, haematocrit 0.4, from donors who had not been taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) were manually poole three ABO-matched PC were pooled and split into four identical products. one untreated PC served as a control (untreated unit) the third PC was directly incubated with the CAD for 14 hours. FFP-diluted platelets were set at 0% aggregation before addition of the agonist. 300 L AB-group FFP was set at 100% aggregation. diluted platelets were agitated for 5 minutes at room temperature. ed with 150 L of 0.1M citrate buffer (pH 5.4) containing 5 mM p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma, S0942) and 0.1% Triton X-100 (Fluka [Buchs, Switzerland], 93420) after incubation for 1 hour at 37 \u00b0C, the reaction was stopped with 100 L of 2.5 M sodium hydroxide. the p-nitrophenol produced by the reaction was measured with a content, contaminating red blood cells and leucocyte counts were within the required ranges, but the volume per unit was below recommendations. the platelet dose of all units was still above the lower limit of 2.51011 platelets during early storage (day 2). platelet aggregation was evaluated in untreated and Intercept-treated PC in response to four agonists: TRAP (8\u201360 M), ADP (8\u201360 M), collagen (2\u20137.5 g/mL), and AA (0.38\u20130.7 mg/mL; Figure 1A\u2013D and Table II). untreated platelets tended to exhibit a better or similar aggregation response upon activation on day 2 compared to intercept-treated platelets, except upon AA activation in vitro measures of Intercept-treated PC (n=5, each coming from 10 donors) in comparison to untreated PC (n=5, each coming from 10 donors) day 2 Day 7 Aggregation response to TRAP (% of maximum aggregation) 10 M 20 M 40 M 60 M 10 M 20 M 40 M 60 M Untreated 19.613.5 69.08.9 81.02.3 84.72.0 8.30.9 45.99.6*** 70.32.2 75.25.0 Intercept 4.61.1 55.18.6 0.723.7 70.321.7 9.49.2 7.62.7 10.72.6*** 14.74.1*** Intercept 8.25.5 10.67.1 19.512.1 27.211.0 11.74.2 15.24.2 25.55.2 31.65.3 Aggregation response to arachidonic acid (% of maximum aggregation) 0.4 mg/mL 0.5 mg/mL 0.38 mg/mL 0.38 mg/mL 0.38 mg/mL 0.38 mg/mL 0.38 mg/mL 0.38 mg s corresponds to FL1+/FL2+ platelets. intercept-treated and untreated platelets showed similar static adhesion to fibrinogen. expression of active GPIIb-IIIa was stable throughout the storage period. the expression of active GPIIbIIIa at the surface of control and Intercept-treated platelets was quantified by flow cytometry using PAC-1 antibody. the results are presented as the mean fluorescence intensity (MFISD, n=4). the agonist concentrations in study 2 were slightly different from the concentrations used in study 1. another AB group FFP was used for aggregometry and required adjustments. the agonist concentrations in study 2 were slightly different from the concentrations used in study 1. all characteristics of the PC fulfilled the requirements of the Intercept treatment. plasma and additive solution content, contaminating red blood cells and leucocyte counts were within the required ranges. however, the platelet dose of all units was still above the lower limit of 2.51011 platelets during early storage (day 2). two PC were pooled and split in two equally divided PC. three PC were pooled and split in four equally divided PC. intercept-treated PC contain amotosalen-hydrochloride solution. ADP (8\u201360 M), (C) collagen (2\u20137.5 g/mL) and (D) arachidonic acid (0.4\u20130.7 mg/mL) was analysed based on mean maximum aggregation (SD, n=5). p0.05,**p0.01,***p0.001 between paired samples. 3.5 g/mL 5.5 g/mL 7.5 g/mL 3.5 g/mL 5.5 g/mL 7.5 g/mL Untreated 16.018.4 34.026.8 60.723.7 70.321.7 9.49.2 7.62.7 10.72.6*** 14.74.1*** Intercept 8.25.5 10.67.1 19.512.1 27.211.0 11.74.2 15.24.2 25.55.2 31.65.3 Aggregation response to arachidonic JC-1 aggregates correspond to FL1+/FL2+ platelets. intercept-treated and untreated platelets exhibited similar static adhesion to fibrinogen. non-specific platelet adhesion was evaluated with non-coated wells. mean number of platelets adhering to the protein-coat is represented as a percentage (SD, n=5) of the number of platelets initially added to the wells. platelets were incubated with the CAD only and illuminated with UVA only. agonist concentrations in study 2 were slightly different from concentrations used in study 1. CAD and UV treatments alone did not induce differences compared to untreated platelets. only the complete Intercept treatment (amotosalen+ UV+CAD) affects platelet aggregation. in vitro findings indicate a decrease in aggregation during storage. however, the effect of photochemical treatment on the aggregation properties of platelets is less clear. platelet activation induces inside-out signalling leading to rapid conversion of the GPIIb-IIIa into its active conformation53. platelet activation induces inside-out signalling leading to rapid conversion of the GPIIb-IIIa into its active conformation53. the measured HSR decreased to the level of that of fresh platelets. however, the measured HSR decreased to the level of that of fresh platelets. the mitochondria-dependent apoptosis pathway is induced in platelets. end-of-storage platelets exhibited a significant increase in phosphatidylserine exposure. most of them exhibited markers of activation, but it remained relatively low. apoptosis markers appear late during storage."}
