{"summary": "Nipah is an emerging pathogen with the potential for Pandemic Nipah virus (NiV) it is an enveloped, single stranded, negative sense RNA paramyxovirus, genus Henipavirus. the natural hosts and wildlife reservoirs of NiV are Old World fruit bats of the genus Pteropus (1). a total of 19 NiV cases, of which 17 resulted in death, were reported in the state of Kerala. 19% were found to be NiV positive by RT-PCR (12) characteristics of NiV that increase the risk of it becoming a global pandemic include humans are already susceptible. a total of 265 cases of encephalitis, of which 105 resulted in death, were confirmed. the epidemiological characteristics of this disease were distinct from those of JE, where 75% of cases occur in children aged 0\u201314 years (19\u201321) by February 1999 similar diseases were recognized in both pigs and humans in new outbreak areas. pigs of this age had high morbidity and low mortality (5%) (26\u201328) pigs were inoculated subcutaneously with a NiV isolate from the central nervous system of a fatally infected human patient. infected animals showed a transient increase in body temperature between 4 and 12 days post-infection. NiV infection was included as the sixth pig disease notifiable to the OIE. no therapeutics or vaccines are approved for use in humans or livestock species. the most studied vaccine candidate is the soluble form of the G protein (sG) the experimental viral vectored vaccine candidates for NiV include vesicular stomatitis virus, rabies virus, canarypox virus (ALVAC strain), adeno-associated virus (AAV), measles virus, Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (40) no challenge was performed in this study. NiV-based vectors have a number of advantages including high titer propagation in chicken eggs removing the requirement for cell culture. no vaccine candidate has progressed toward market for either pigs or humans. we are systematically analyzing the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of three NiV vaccine candidates in pigs. in-contact animals will be introduced to assess transmission of challenge virus from vaccinates or unvaccinated control animals. the commercial development of NiV vaccines for use in pigs (other livestock or humans) is limited and animal health companies are of the opinion that NiV vaccines will have limited marketability. the highly unpredictable nature of NiV outbreaks means that it is highly unlikely that NiV vaccines would be used routinely by pig producers. one strategy that could ensure that immunity to NiV is maintained in pig herds could involve the engineering of NiV G into a live attenuated viral vaccine, such as pseudorabies. a vaccine to protect against anthrax was the first to be approved through the \u201canimal rule\u201d in 2015. the licensing pathway for the \u201cAnimal Rule\u201d requires that immunogenicity results from clinical trials must be consistent with previously identified immune correlates associated with protection (52). identifying reliable markers of vaccine-generated immunity becomes critically important for pathogens such as NiV. pigs can play a key role in the epidemiology of NiV by acting as an amplifier host. the region most at risk of NiV infection has some of the highest pig population densities found anywhere in the world. development of a NiV vaccine for use in pig populations would decrease the major risk of NiV transmission to pigs and humans."}
