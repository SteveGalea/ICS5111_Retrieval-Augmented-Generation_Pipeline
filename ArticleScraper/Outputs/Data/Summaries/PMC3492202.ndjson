{"summary": "the genus Ebolavirus of the family Filoviridae currently consists of five species. all species, with exception of Reston ebolavirus, have been found in africa. if this virus is prevalent in China is unknown. from 2006\u20132009, 843 bats were trapped in their natural habitat from several provinces in mainland china. most animals were released back into their habitat. ELISA plates were coated with the recombinant Reston-NP at approximately 100 ng/well and bat sera were tested in triplicates at a dilution of 1:100, 1:400, and 1:1600. positive serum samples were retested at dilutions of 1:100, 1:400, and 1:1600 against both Reston-NP and Zaire-NP. ELISA Bat species No. positive / No. tested were from 10 of the 23 bat species collected from 5 different locations. 17 had OD450 readings higher than 0.19 at 1:400 and 3 at 1:1600. 10 samples had OD450 values higher than 0.19 at 1:400 and 4 at 1:1600. is 0/6 Myotis daubentonii 0/24 Myotis fimbriatus 0/2 Myotis spp. 3/118(2.54%) Scotophilus kuhli 1/25(4%) Unknown 0/2 Total 32/843(3.8%) Figure 3. Western-blot analysis of ELISA positive serum samples with recombinant Reston-NP and Zaire-NP expressed inE. coli. a surrogate virus neutralization test was conducted using a recombinant env- HIV-1 virus containing the luciferase reporter gene pseudotyped with spike glycoprotein proteins (GP) of EBOV (Zaire-GP) or RESTV (Reston-GP [11]) the reston-GP gene was synthesized based on the RESTV genome sequence (FJ621583). luciferase activity measured using a Luciferase assay kit (Promega) none of the positive bat serum inhibited entry of Reston-GP or Zaire-GP pseudotyped virus. RNA was extracted using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) no filovirus-specific RNA was detected by one step RT-PCR among 143 tissue samples. a genetically distinct filovirus was found in dead insectivorous bats in Spain [15] suggesting that filoviruses have a wider host range and geographical location than previously thought. unsuccessful identification of ebolavirus-related genes in the samples is likely attributable to the often low-level of virus replication. there are approximately 120 species of bats distributed throughout China. Prof. Lijun Rong provided the Zaire G protein gene gene."}
