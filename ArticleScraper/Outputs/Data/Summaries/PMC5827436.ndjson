{"summary": "defensin families are genetically related, but are distinguished by amino acid chain length and distinctive tridisulfide motifs that are characteristic of each family. -defensins are unique in that they are 18-amino acid macrocyclic peptides known to be expressed only in cells of Old World monkeys. -defensin isoforms are produced by homo- or heterodimeric head-to-tail ligation of nonapeptides excised from one or two of three known propeptides. the ribbon structure of RTD-1 shows the substituent nonapeptides (blue and gold) spliced to form the mature macrocycle. pristane-induced arthritis is an autoimmune disease characterized by dysregulated proinflammatory cytokines and erosive joint changes similar to those associated with RA (18). pristane-induced arthritis rapidly induced arrest of disease progression and resolution of arthritis that correlated with significant reduction in pro-TNF cytokines in joint tissues. a previous study showed that RTD-1 suppressed the release of several pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF, IL-1, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, CCL2, and CCL4 by human buffy coat leukocytes stimulated with agonists of TLRs 2, 4, 5, and 8 (14). in the absence of peptide, stimulated cells secreted 30\u20131100 pg/ml of TNF. RTD-1 inhibits TNF release by THP-1 cells but does not affect downstream signaling of sTNF in colonic epithelial cells. cells were incubated for 60 min with 5 m RTD-1 or vehicle, washed, and stimulated with LPS in the presence or absence of 5 m RTD-1. this result was not due to neutralization of LPS. HT-29 cells express TNF receptor I (TNFRI) and release IL-8 in response to sTNF. this was unaffected by the co-incubation with RTD-1 (Fig. 3B), and RTD-1 alone had no effect on IL-8 release by HT-29 cells. sigmoidal inhibitory response of RTD-1 was 10-fold less potent than marimastat. a single chain opening in the RTD-1 backbone reduced inhibitory potency >99% (Fig. 4A) we also tested the TACE inhibitory activities of human -defensins. none of the HNPs, nor S7 were effective in blocking TNF release. results are expressed as mean S.D. of 2- 6 individual experiments containing 2 technical repeats each. RTDs 1\u20135 varied markedly in their inhibition of rhTACE. each peptide dose-dependently inhibited TACE, but with IC50 values that ranged from 50 to 265 nm. TDs 1\u20135 for sTNF release by LPS-stimulated THP-1 monocytes and whole blood were plotted against IC50 values of each peptide for rTACE inhibition. we incubated RTDs 1\u20135 with THP-1 macrophages and HT-29 epithelial cells in the presence of a fluorogenic substrate that mimics membrane-bound TNF. results are shown as mean S.D. of two independent experiments containing 2\u20133 technical repeats each. -defensins inhibit TACE and ADAM10 expressed on COS7 cells. data represent mean S.D. of 2 independent experiments containing 2 technical repeats each. RTDs inhibit rADAM10 proteolysis of its fluorogenic substrate. RTD-1 is a fast binding, non-competitive inhibitor of TACE. a large molar ratio of RTD-1 (0.05\u201325 m) to TACE (2 nm) is required for proteolytic inhibition. the value for a non-competitive inhibitor is the same as its IC50 value. a previous study showed that RTD-1 suppressed the release of several pro-inflammatory cytokines. sTNF release is shown as a percent of TNF released compared with peptide-free controls for each agonist. bars represent mean S.D. of two independent experiments performed in duplicate. HT-29 cells were treated with 0\u20135 m RTD-1, stimulated with 500 pg/ml of rTNF for 4 h, and supernatant IL-8 was quantified. control incubations (Ctrl) lacked TNF and produced no IL-8 response, as did samples treated with RTD-1 alone. we hypothesized that RTD-1 inhibits TNF release by inhibition of its mobilization from the cell surface by its principal convertase, TACE (ADAM17) the inhibition by RTD-1 did not require preincubation of the peptide and the TACE enzyme. inhibition of recombinant TACE proteolytic activity is shown as percent change in rate of product formation relative to peptide-free control. results are expressed as mean S.D. of 2- 6 individual experiments containing 2 technical repeats each. IC50 values of RTDs 1\u20135 for sTNF release by stimulated THP-1 monocytes and whole blood were plotted against IC50 values of each peptide for rTACE inhibition. -defensins inhibit TACE activities of THP-1 and HT-29 cells. RTDs 1\u20135 were incubated with THP-1 macrophages or HT-29 cells. substrate conversion was monitored continuously for 60 min at 37 \u00b0C. results are shown as mean S.D. of two independent experiments containing 2\u20133 technical repeats each. data are expressed as fold-TGF shedding relative to constitutive BTC release. C, RTD-1, but not S7 or HNP-4, inhibits ADAM10-dependent cleavage of BTC in COS7 cells. RTD-1 is a fast-binding non-competitive inhibitor of TACE. the hypothesis that RTDs inhibit TACE was based in part on the rapid blockade of sTNF release by E. coli-stimulated leukocytes exposed to RTD-1 (14) kinetics of RTD-1 inhibition of rhTACE was determined by measuring substrate conversion in reactions with varied substrate and peptide concentrations. rhTACE inhibition could not be overcome by increasing concentrations of substrate, thus Vmax decreased with increasing RTD-1 concentrations, whereas Km remained unaffected. known endogenous inhibitors of TACE sheddase activity other than tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases 3 (TIMP3) have been shown to play a critical role in regulating pro-TNF shedding. -defensin inhibition of TACE is rapid, non-tight binding, reversible, and non-competitive. -defensins stimulate proinflammatory pathways (38\u201343) and lack inhibitory activities against TACE or ADAM10. -defensins may underlie the differential susceptibility of humans and other great apes to endotoxin. small molecules evaluated for this purpose include succinates, hydroxamates, sulfonamides, -lactams, -benzamido compounds, benzothiadiazepine inhibitors, and zinc chelators. none of these programs has produced an approved TACE-targeted drug due to lack of efficacy and/or off target toxicities. human colonic epithelial HT-29 cells were grown to confluence in 24-well tissue culture dishes. HT-29 cells were incubated with 0\u20135 m RTD-1 plus 500 pg/ml of recombinant human TNF. leukocytes were stimulated for 4 h with the indicated concentrations of TLR agonist in the presence of 0\u20135 m of RTDs 1\u20135 at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO2. TNF in cell-free supernatants was determined by ELISA (Life Technologies) individual RTDs were added to TACE (0.1 g/ml, 2 nm) or ADAM10 (0.05 g/ml, 1 nm) at final concentrations of 0\u20131.5 m. substrate conversion was measured every 30 s for 30 min at 22 \u00b0C. COS7 cells transfected with AP-tagged substrates were cultured overnight, washed, starved 2\u20134 h in Opti-MEM (Gibco) and incubated for 10 min with 0\u20135 m RTDs 1\u20135 in fresh media. TACE activity was induced by addition of 25 ng/ml of PMA for 30\u201345 min. NH2 in the presence of 25 ng/ml of rTACE and enzyme activity was measured every 30 s for 90 min. inhibition of rTACE by RTD-1 was also determined by addition of 0\u201325 m RTD-1 to steady-state (Vs) TACE-Mca-PLAQAV-Dpa-RSSSR-NH2 reactions were monitored for 10 min prior to addition of peptide. human colonic epithelial HT-29 cells were grown to confluence in 24-well tissue culture dishes in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS and 100 units/ml of penicillin/streptomycin in 5% CO2. HT-29 cells were incubated with 0\u20135 m RTD-1 plus 500 pg/ml of human EDTA plasma. supernatants were analyzed for soluble IL-8 by ELISA. THP-1 cells (5 105 cells/ml) were stimulated for 4 h with the indicated concentrations of TLR agonist. assays were performed in black Maxisorp 96-well plates in 25 mm Tris. individual RTDs were added to TACE (0.1 g/ml, 2 nm) or ADAM10 (0.05 g/ml, 1 nm) at final concentrations of 0\u20131.5 m followed by addition of 10 m fluorogenic substrates. -Dpa-RSSSR-NH2) were added to cells and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 60 min. fluorescence (320ex/405em) was measured at 30-s intervals. effect of RTDs on cellular TACE and ADAM10 activities were also analyzed. kinetics RTD-1 (0\u2013960 nm) was incubated with 2.5, 5, 10 and 20 m Mca-PLAQAV-Dpa-RSSSR-NH2 (320ex/405em) in the presence of 25 ng/ml of rTACE and enzyme activity was measured every 30 s for 90 min. initial velocity (Vo) was plotted as a function of substrate concentration.
