{"summary": "PEDV is a member of the genus Alphacoronavirus within the family Coronaviridae. it contains six known open reading frames, encoding the replicase polyproteins. the glycoprotein S mediates receptor binding and membrane fusion during virus entry. PEDV LAVs based on classical (G1) strains have been applied in Asian countries (11) but their efficacies against the emerging highly virulent (G2) strains were minimal, probably due to the antigenic difference between the S proteins of G1 and G2 strains. a better strategy for PEDV LAVs should be to maintain the critical epitopes in the S protein that are conserved in the wild-type viruses to retain optimal immunogenicity. ated guanosine nucleoside (m7GpppN) and a methyl group at the 2\u2032-O-ribose position (cap 1) of the first nucleotide are catalyzed by three nsps, nsp14 (the N-7 methyltransferase [MTase] domain), nsp16 (the 2\u2032-O-MTase), and nsp10 (26\u201330 PEDV mutants with nsp16 inactivated were generated, with partial (D129A) or complete (KDKE4A) replacement of the catalytic tetrad. inactivation of endocytosis signal partially attenuated the virulent icPC22A in neonatal piglets without altering major neutralizing epitopes. a single alanine substitution (D129A) or quadruple alanine substitutions (K45A-D129A-K169A-E202A) into the catalytic tetrad of the 2\u2032-O-MTase of icPC22A. a third mutant, KDKE4A-SYA, was constructed by inactivating both K-D-K-E and the endocytosis signal (Y1378A) of the KDKE residues of ARS-CoV are shown in blue and those of PEDV are shown in red. in the amino acid sequence, the motif YEVF is in red and the motif KVHVQ is in blue. the stop codon in the S protein is indicated as a dot. recombinant PEDVs in vero cells were pretreated with different concentrations of IFN-. all the nsp16 mutants produced significantly lower titers of progeny viruses than the virulent icPC22A. the mutants were more sensitive to higher concentrations of IFN- than the D129A mutant. RNA (F), sgmRNA-N (H), and sgmRNA-3 (G) in PEDV-infected Vero cells at 10 hpi. groups with significant differences are indicated with different letters. error bars indicate standard deviations. swine IFN-, -, -1, -3, and -4 in the infected cells. the UV-inactivated icPC22A did not stimulate IFN responses. luciferase assays examined whether infection with the mutant PEDVs activated the IFN-1 and - promoters. IPEC-DQ cells were inoculated with recombinant PEDVs (MOI = 1) or UV-inactivated icPC22A. total RNA was extracted at 0, 9, and 12 hpi and quantified by reverse transcription followed by real-time qPCR. piglets had significantly lower and delayed peak infectious PEDV shedding titers than the virulent-icPC22A-inoculated pigs. no significant differences were observed in the amounts of infectious PEDV in the rectal swabs and intestinal contents. nsp16 protein significantly attenuated the highly virulent PEDV in neonatal piglets. additional inactivation of the endocytosis signal in the nsp16 protein further reduced its virulence. two diarrheic piglets from the KDKE4A and KDKE4A-SYA groups and one mock-treated piglet were euthanized at 2 dpi for histopathological examination. a pig with a score of 2 was defined as having diarrhea. a pig with a score of 2 was defined as having diarrhea. values below detection limit were considered negative. values in the mutant groups were compared with those in the virulent-icPC22A group by Student's t test. one pig in the KDKE4A-SYA-inoculated group had mild diarrhea for 1 day. but all the mock-challenged pigs developed severe diarrhea for 7.17 0.98 days. no infectious PEDV was detected in the rectal swab samples from pigs. four-day-old piglets induced 80% and 100% protection, respectively, against diarrhea following subsequent challenge with virulent icPC22A. clinical signs and PEDV shedding in pigs postchallenge with the highly virulent icPC22A. each dot represents the score of an individual pig; each line indicates the mean scores of a group. a pig with a score of 2 was defined as having diarrhea. we sequenced the nsp16 and S cytoplasmic tail region from the rectal swab samples from pigs collected at 16 to 20 dpi. we did not find any reversion of the introduced mutations. due to the low PEDV RNA titers, we were not able to amplify sufficient amounts for complete genomic sequencing of the mutants. trad K46-D130-K170-E203 with alanine significantly inactivated 2\u2032-O-MTase activity. the catalytic tetrad K45-D129-K169-E202 is highly homologous to the counterpart in icPC22A. a third mutant, KDKE4A-SYA, was constructed by inactivating both K-D-K-E and the endocytosis signal (Y1378A) the number in gray indicates how many residues in nsp16 are not shown. the 3D model of the structure of PEDV nsp16 is shown in blue. the residues of the putative catalytic tetrad are shown in red. nsp16 mutants produced larger plaques and replicated more efficiently at early time points than the KDKE4A mutant. we compared the replication of the recombinant PEDVs in vero cells that were pretreated with different concentrations of IFN-. the mutants were more sensitive to IFN- responses in cell culture than the wild-type viruses. the cells were pretreated with different concentrations of IFN- and inoculated with the individual viruses. nsp16-inactivated PEDV mutants induced stronger IFN responses than icPC22A in vitro. we quantified the mRNAs of swine IFN-, -, -1, -3, and -4 in the infected cells. the UV-inactivated icPC22A did not stimulate IFN responses. however, the mutant PEDVs activated the IFN-1 and - promoters. IPEC-DQ cells were inoculated with recombinant PEDVs (MOI = 1) or UV-inactivated icPC22A. total RNA was extracted at 0, 9, and 12 hpi. all eight icPC22A-inoculated piglets had severe diarrhea and died within 6 dpi (100%; 8/8) in comparison, only one piglet had severe diarrhea for 1 day. virulent-icPC22A-inoculated pigs had significantly lower infectious PEDV shedding titers. icPC22A and the KDKE4A-SYA mutant induced significantly milder villous atrophy in the ileum than the KDKE4A mutant. the inactivation of the catalytic tetrad K-D-K-E in the nsp16 protein significantly attenuated the highly virulent PEDV in neonatal piglets. the additional inactivation of the endocytosis signal in the S protein further reduced its vir two diarrheic piglets from the KDKE4A and KDKE4A-SYA groups and one mock-treated piglet were euthanized at 2 dpi for histopathological examination. b Fecal consistency (FC) was scored as follows: 0, solid; 1, pasty; 2, semiliquid; and 3, liquid. FC scores of 2 and 3 were considered moderate diarrhea and severe diarrhea, respectively. each symbol represents the titer of the PEDV N gene in 1 ml or gram of rectal swab sample from an individual piglet collected daily. values below the detection limit (dotted line at 4.8 log10 copies/ml) were considered negative. two mock-challenged pigs died 6 or 7 days postchallenge (dpc) no KDKE4A-SYA-inoculated pig had diarrhea and only one pig had mild diarrhea for 1 day. all the mock-challenged pigs developed severe diarrhea for 7.17 0.98 days. piglets elicited VN antibodies before challenge, and the challenge significantly boosted titers at 30 dpi/9 dpc. infection with KDKE4A and KDKE4A-SYA of 4-day-old piglets induced 80% and 100% protection against diarrhea following subsequent challenge with virulent icPC22A. a pig with a score of 2 was defined as having diarrhea. a pig with a score of 2 was defined as having diarrhea. a pig with a score of 2 was defined as having diarrhea. the viral genome in the intestinal contents at the third passage was verified by Sanger sequencing. no sequence alteration was found in the nine introduced mutations. the virus has acquired one synonymous mutation in nsp12, two synonymous mutations in nsp15, and one nonsynonymous (F375L) mutation in the S1 subunit. emergence and reemergence of enteric CoVs in swine have raised concerns about their economic impacts on the pork industry. the nsp16 protein of CoVs is highly conserved among CoVs (33), representing a suitable mutagenesis target for this purpose. previous studies showed that live S-INDEL strains induce partial cross-protection against challenge with the original U.S. PEDV (7, 43), although the two subtypes of PEDV induced similar levels of VN antibodies in serum and their VN antibodies cross-reacted to each other. further pig experiments are needed to examine whether the original U.S. PEDV-based KDKE4A-SYA mutant induces sufficient protection against challenge with a heterologous S-INDEL PEDV strain a coV lacking all the K-D-K-E residues was still viable in vitro and in vivo. the PEDV D129A mutant was not evaluated in pigs because we speculate that the single mutant might be more virulent than the KDKE4A mutant. the replication of the MHV D129A mutant was poor in wild-type macrophages but was enhanced in interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1 (IFIT 1)-knockout macrophages. stable expression of wild-type nsp16 in a cell line may compensate for the inactivated catalytic tetrad function in the mutants. a PEDV reduced its IFN antagonism, resulting in enhanced induction of both type I and type III IFNs in vitro and viral attenuation in vivo (53). these mutants triggered earlier IFN responses than icPC22A in IPEC-DQ cells, probably due to the 2\u2032-O-methylation-free viral RNAs that triggered melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) the Y1378A mutation in the cytoplasmic tail of the S protein disrupts the 6-nucleotide TRS of the ORF3 sgmRNA by 2 nucleotides. the icYA mutant also induced higher type I and type III IFN responses than icPC22A in IPEC-DQ cells. maintaining the genetic stability of coV LAV candidates is critical for vaccine development. the catalytic tetrad in the accessory protein 8a compensated for the loss of the same motif in the E protein (59) the catalytic tetrad in CoV nsp16 seems to be a stable target for mutagenesis. the mutated S protein retained the two nucleotide substitutions in nsp16 after continuous replication in immune-deficient mice for 30 days. two independent recombination events are required to revert two distant mutations to wild type when the LAV and a virulent virus coinfect a cell. one study showed that combined inactivation of nsp16 and nsp14 further reduced the reversion to virulence of the recombinant SARS-CoV in vivo. a recent study showed that intramuscular inoculation of a virulent PEDV triggered intestinal infection in pigs. the timing of vaccination significantly affects multiple immune parameters in sows. IPEC-DQ is a subclone of the swine intestinal epithelial cell line IPEC-J2. the cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% FBS. the propagation of PEDV in Vero cells was described previously. luciferase activities were determined using a dual-luciferase reporter assay system. the 3D structure of PEDV nsp16 was modeled with the SWISS-MODEL online tool. plasmids were digested, purified, and mixed together in equal molar ratio. a single clone of each PEDV mutant was propagated once in vero cells to generate a viral stock (P1) the full-length genome of each virus stock was verified by Sanger sequencing. recombinant PEDV icYA bearing only the Y1378A mutation in the genome was generated previously. each surviving piglet was challenged orally with 6 log10 PFU of icPC22A. the severity of diarrhea was scored based on the fecal consistency in individual pigs. biotinylated anti-porcine IFN- (3.75 mg/ml; clone F17; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was used for detection. the detection limit for the IFN- assay is 4 pg/ml. the coding sequences of nsp16 and the S cytoplasmic tail were amplified from the rectal swab samples collected at 16 to 20 dpi by reverse transcription followed by nested PCR using PrimeStar HiFi polymerase. for plaque assay, monolayers of vero cells were inoculated with 10-fold serially diluted PEDVs for 1 h in the presence of trypsin (10 g/ml) vero cells were inoculated with recombinant PEDVs at an MOI of 0.01. the cells were frozen at 80\u00b0C and cultured for 24 h. gRNA isolation, reverse transcription, and real-time RT-qPCR. cDNA was subject to quantitative PCR using MMLV reverse transcriptase. sgmRNA-N was also detected in the sample as a control. both sgmRNAs are reported as copies per 108 copies of gRNA. total cellular RNA was isolated, and cellular DNA was removed. the data in Fig. 4A and 6A were analyzed by log rank test. cells, plasmids, and reagents were compared to the icPC22A group. the IFN- luciferase plasmid pRL-TK (Promega) was included as an internal control. the cells were transfected with the IFN-1- or IFN-\u2013luciferase plasmid (0.3 g/well) and pRL-TK (0.03 g/well) for 24 h. the plasmids were digested, purified, and mixed together in equal molar ratio. the full-length genomic cDNA was ligated with T4 ligase (NEB, Ipswich, MA) and transcribed into RNA using an mMessage mMachine T7 transcription kit. after transfection, cytopathic effects (CPE) appeared within 2 days. two diarrheic piglets in the KDKE4A and KDKE4A-SYA groups and one mock-treated piglet were euthanized at 2 dpi. each surviving pig was challenged orally with 6 log10 PFU of icPC22A and housed for 9 more days to evaluate protection. piglets that showed anorexia and dehydration over 24 h had to be euthanized. a third piglet at 17 days of age was inoculated with the diluted SIC containing 1,000 PFU of the P1 virus. PCR fragments covering the complete PEDV genome were amplified using PrimeStar HiFi polymerase. the coding sequences of nsp16 and the S cytoplasmic tail were amplified from the rectal swab samples collected at 16 to 20 dpi. the growth curve of PEDV in IPEC-DQ cells (MOI = 1) was determined by a similar procedure. the cells were inoculated with recombinant PEDVs at an MOI of 0.01. sgmRNA-3 was amplified with forward primer (CTATCTACGGATAGTTAGCTC), reverse primer (CTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGGAC-BHQ) copy numbers of each amplicon were determined by standard curves and normalized with the mass of total cellular RNA. the data in Fig. 2B, F, H, and G and 3 were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance. the data in Fig. 4E and F were analyzed by Student's t test by comparing each mutant group with the icPC22A group at the same time point."}
