{"summary": "china is one of the world primary producers of poultry products, and poultry is one of the main sources of meat in the country. in 2004, the total loss caused by the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) H5N1 was 4.5 billion US dollars in China [2] migratory birds carry the virus and spread it to domestic birds. poultry is generally kept in high density and enclosed housing conditions with high biosecurity measures. the majority of backyard poultry owners raise the poultry in open yards in a small scale. the birds are usually associated with the transmission of the lowly pathogenic avian influenza virus from wild birds. region A is located in the southern part of Poyang Lake, and close to the Nanji Wetlands National Nature Reserve. the annual net income of local farmers was 1,182 USD per person in 2010. the local government would organize free immunizations twice a year. local veterinarians pointed out that the prevailing infectious diseases were avian influenza, Newcastle disease, Escherichia coli infection, fowl cholera and egg drop syndrome. questionnaire administered by three trained individuals who interviewed farm owners or an adult family member if the owner was absent. questionnaires were maintained by investigators and would not be released to the third party for confidentiality. the final model of potential risk factors was constructed using the iterative maximum-likelihood estimation procedure. adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. a P value 0.05 was considered statistically significant. the annual net income of farmers was 554 USD per person in 2010 [25] there was no commercial farm with more than 300 birds in this area according to the local veterinary services. a cross-sectional survey was conducted to investigate rearing and biosecurity practices, and flock health history. the addresses of the commercial and backyard poultry farms were collected from local livestock offices. in each administrative village, two natural villages were randomly sampled. each natural village was assigned with a unique number. Region A+B differs from Region C in that both Region A and Region B own large scale commercial poultry farms in high densities. chi-square (2) or Fisher\u2019s exact tests were performed for counting data obtained from survey. there was a significant difference between Region A and Region B in terms of species of poultry raised in the backyard (P 0.001) the percentage of chickens was only 51.81% in Region A versus 91.10% in Region B. chicken+goose 5 (2.08) 1 (1.45) 2 (2.41) 3 (1.90) Duck+goose 1 (0.42) 0 (0.00) 0 (0.00) 1 (0.60) Number of birds* Chicken n=233 n=69 0.830 n=77 n=156 0.014 1-10 127 (54.51) 34 (49.28) 34 (44.16) 93 (59.62) 11-25 83 (35.62) 33 (47.83) 31 penned laying ducks (Region A) versus penned laying hens (Region B). c 2 or Fisher\u2019s exact tests. * Exclusive. ** Non-exclusive.
