{"summary": "bringing NAATs to the point of care (POC) is envisioned to revolutionize healthcare. many NAATs require access to expensive, specialized equipment. these procedures require an extraction step to isolate DNA or RNA from blood, urine or sputum. these platforms present breakthrough technologies for rapid, cost-effective, and user-friendly diagnostics. they demonstrate the feasibility of implementing existing nucleic acid amplification methods for POC use. an alternative approach to time-consuming and cumbersome sample preparation is performing NAATs directly from complex samples. literature surveyed from 1989\u20132017 and came across a significant number of works that reported NAATs from bodily samples without the complex steps generally involved in sample preparation. this meant discarding the works that depended on sophisticated instruments and operations that are labor-, time-, and cost-intensive, such as enzymatic (proteinases), chemical (acids, detergents), or physical (temperature shock, mechanical disruptions) treatments. 174 published works surveyed extracted and recorded data that corresponded to test performance. accuracy, specificity, user-friendliness, training requirements, and so on. we have classified assays that can feasibly be completed without extensive training. sample dilution reduces the limit of detection (LOD) most NAATs analyze only a fraction of the sample volume. sample dilution therefore increases the likelihood of false negative results. 174 published works surveyed extracted and recorded data that correspond to test performance. amplification methodologies, user-friendliness, and user-friendliness are deemed \u201cdirect\u201d. the \u201csemi-direct\u201d assays have the following exceptions to a simple laboratory setup. categorized as \u201csemi-direct\u201d face some hurdles to implementation as an on-site service for patient care. we have devised three major criteria that are indicative of each platform\u2019s robustness, sensitivity, and clinical efficacy. we found certain parameters could be distilled into numerical data. a number of isothermal amplification techniques have been used to develop direct NAATs. amplification uses a strand-displacing polymerase and two pairs of primers. amplification employs a strand-displacing polymerase and two pairs of primers. the continuous, homogeneous, isothermal process relies on RNA polymerase, RNase, and reverse transcriptase. the reverse transcriptase creates a double stranded RNA:DNA hybrid from the RNA template; the original RNA is destroyed; a DNA duplex is synthesized; the polymerase can transcribe RNA from the DNA. each new RNA molecule can repeat the cycle for exponential amplification. recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) avoids thermal cycling by using three core proteins that operate optimally between 37\u201340 \u00b0C. the first protein, recombinase, binds to primers that recombine with a duplex target for strand displacement. the second, a single-stranded DNA binding protein, attaches to the displaced strand before a strand-displacing polymerase copies the DNA from MDA Multiple displacement amplification (MDA) is a technique that exploits the strand displacement, proofreading, and polymerase activity of the 29 bacteriophage DNA polymerase. the highly processive polymerase uses random primers to amplify an entire genome. the technique is well-suited for whole genome amplification from crude biological samples. NASBA The nucleic acid sequence-based amplification method is unique in its ability to amplify single-stranded RNA directly [20] this is most desirable for targeting RNA viruses and for transcriptome analysis. NASBA is also used outside of the commercial sector with systems to monitor viruses in serum. the best way to overcome off-target amplification is to use simple pretreatment procedures like those developed for detection with the BDProbe-Tec. the best way to overcome off-target amplification is to use simple pretreatment procedures like those that have been developed for detection with the BDProbe-Tec. MDA Multiple displacement amplification (MDA) is a technique that exploits the strand displacement, proofreading, and polymerase activity of the 29 bacteriophage DNA polymerase. amplification continues until the hairpins are depleted. swab samples had been most analyzed, while urine and stool samples had been least analyzed. isothermal techniques have surpassed PCR and RT-PCR in terms of the number of assays performed on whole blood samples. heme compounds, anticoagulants, and immunoglobulin G (IgG) can interfere with amplification reactions by inhibiting DNA polymerase activity [33] or chelating necessary cofactors [34,35]. nucleic acid testing has great potential for blood-based tests in POC situations where collection volumes are small (e.g., finger pricks) and parasite loads may be low. semi-direct works with PCR have employed over 50% blood in a reaction after heat-cold shock. PCR typically employs the Taq polymerase from Thermus aquaticus. PCR can also be optimized through the use of more unconventional polymerases. simple treatments with heat [59,65,66,67,68,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76] or chemicals [73,77,78,79,80,81] can increase the sensitivity of the LAMP or RT-LAMP reaction. some of these assays employ a post-heating centrifugation step, but this step could likely be avoided in semi-direct processes. filter paper has been used as medium to test blood for infectious diseases since the 1940s [87] from syphilis to infant screening in the 1960s. commercial technologies are even becoming widely available to map, monitor, and survey blood spots from patients infected with malaria or other neglected tropical diseases. most of the approaches to amplify DNA directly in blood spots use eluants to overcome the various difficulties that impede PCR reactions. eluants can achieve even higher sensitivities than standard extraction protocols. rum blood plasma and serum are widely used for quantitative molecular diagnostics in the areas of clinical decision-making and therapeutic management. plasma is the pale yellowish fluid that normally holds the blood cells of whole blood in suspension, whereas serum is the remnants of blood plasma after the removal of clotting factors [110]. Circulating DNA in serum and plasma is a biomarker for a diverse array of systemic, infectious, and genetic diseases. researchers have developed convenient PCR assays for both direct and semi-direct testing in blood-based fluids. by using enhanced enzymes, DNA [49,50,67,120] and RNA [121,122] targets have been successfully amplified in plasma and serum. heat-based pretreatment can be used to release nucleic acids prior to carrying out amplification. direct NAATs for Saliva and Sputum Saliva and sputum are abundant and easy to obtain. saliva flows into the oral cavities through salivary glands. blood vessels secrete the same protein and nucleic acid biomarkers as in peripheral blood. most reported nucleic acid testing methods for saliva and sputum show fairly high numbers. the approaches we examined generally employ dilutions of 20% or less. the lowest LOD achieved\u20142 fg of Acinetobacter baumannii bacterial gDNA in sputum\u2014required pretreatment with Sputazyme (Kyokuto, Tokyo, Japan) PCR is very useful for profiling large numbers of bacteria. some species are recalcitrant to lysing, like Streptococcus. amplification is also possible in the field of LAMP-based diagnostics. the addition of NALC to a sputum specimen prior to extraction had no effect on testing for TB [167]. sputum has been used in PCR after adding mucolytic agents [56,169], diluting in buffer [148], or bead-beating [157] to reduce viscosity. Priye et al.\u2019s recent multiplexed RT-LAMP detection system for zika, dengue, and chikungunya achieved LODs of 44 copies/reaction with no need for lysis or extraction. swab tests now on the market remove these inhibitors via extraction methods that are too involved and complex to be suitable for the POC [178]. one remarkable study examined 4518 patient swabs in direct PCR for STR (short tandem repeat) analysis. the authors did not report the yields of DNA obtained or the lowest amounts detected. this is a particularly common problem amongst these references. the most sensitive tests on swabs rely on LAMP reactions. fewer than 10 copies/reaction of viral targets were seen after brief heating steps in Hank\u2019s buffer [197], M-Swab diluent [198], or water [202]. direct NAATs for Urine and Stool Diseases of the kidney or genitourinary tract can often be detected from stool or urine. urea is typically present in adult urine at concentrations six-fold greater than can be tolerated in PCR reactions. new tab Nucleic acid testing in fecal and urine samples. changes to the reaction chemistry could relieve the negative effects of the sample matrix. the polyacrylamide gel matrix effectively filters biological inhibitors out of the amplification reaction. the developers of the recently established isothermal method SIBA showed the utility of this amplification technique by detecting Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae in a low-copy urine sample [25]. within each sample type, we plotted the number of clinical samples that have been analyzed by direct NAATs from 1989 to 2017. PCR and RT-PCR have surpassed PCR and RT-PCR in terms of the number of assays performed on whole blood samples. time-series data for direct nucleic acid diagnostics according to accrued number of samples tested. blood contains circulating nucleic acids, cells, and over 20,000 different proteins. nucleic acid testing has great potential for blood-based tests in POC situations where collection volumes are small (e.g., finger pricks) and parasite loads may be low. some of these are purported to have very low LODs that reach below the fg level. the Taq family of polymerases can amplify DNA from whole blood. PCR can likewise be optimized through the use of more unconventional polymerases. these referenced works offer expedited methods to obtain amplifiable templates with similar sensitivities to chemical extraction kits. no assay has come close to reaching the capacity of Burckhardt et al.\u2019s PCR amplification with Taq polymerase in nearly 80% whole blood, as demonstrated over 20 years ago in 1994. the associated treatment method is one of the more technically-involved and time-intensive, demanding 20 cycles of heating and cooling. all of the tests we surveyed have been validated with actual dried blood spots. pretreatment with heating-cooling cycles and addition of spermidine to the reaction helped boost the efficiency and yield of the amplification. amplification results are comparable to the conventional gold standard of microscopy. the easiest way to address the latter problem is through long elution times. the latter, through centrifugation, resulted in a specificity and sensitivity of 100%. membrane-based sedimentation and microscale devices for cell differentiation and filtration have made blood separation a single step process at the POC. in assessing nucleic acid testing with plasma or serum, we see that most reactions are performed at sample concentrations in the 20% range. plasma and serum contain very low-abundance analytes. nucleic acid tests need to operate with high sensitivity. sputum, a necessary sample for respiratory infections, is mucus from the lower airways. sputum has become the specimen of choice for detecting tuberculosis [141,142] as for sputum, it has become the specimen of choice for detecting tuberculosis. most reported nucleic acid testing methods for saliva and sputum show fairly high numbers for patient samples. PCR is very useful for profiling large numbers of bacteria. some species are recalcitrant to lysing, like Streptococcus. other groups have followed suit in detecting bacterial taxa in healthy. nucleic acid-based methods process samples analogously to culture-based protocols. sputum is liquefied through several buffer exchanges and high-speed centrifugation into a more manipulative sample. an additional concern is decontamination, which is necessary for culture. LAMP had a sensitivity of 97.9%, detecting 173 out of 177 smear-negative, culture-positive sputum samples. the authors canvassed the laboratory personnel after they implemented the heating, washing, and filter-tip capture steps before direct amplification. swabs [13] or STIs in dermal, genital, and conjunctival swabs [173] are used for rapid, accurate patient diagnosis. many swab tests now on the market remove these inhibitors via extraction methods that are too involved and complex to be suitable for the POC [178] dilution or heating can save over thirty minutes of processing time. LAMP-based testing of swab samples can also be performed at room-temperature [192,193,194,195,196] or while heated [145,197,198,198,199,200,201,202], as can MDA [84]. the most sensitive tests on swabs rely on LAMP reactions. fewer than 10 copies/reaction of viral targets were seen after brief heating steps in Hank\u2019s buffer (197), M-Swab diluent (Copan Diagnostics Inc., Murrieta, CA, USA) [202]. fecal and urine samples have been tested for pathogens such as Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Clostridium difficile with high sensitivity and specificity. there is a clear need for increased testing with patient samples, as nearly half of the referenced works do not include clinical validation. we believe a dilution step could accomplish the same feat by allowing solids to settle at the base of a highly aqueous, non-viscous sample. Isothermal amplification techniques like LAMP and RPA generally demonstrate a higher tolerance than PCR for urine. study of direct PCR on 4518 buccal swabs is robust and carried out directly on the entire sample for maximum ease. despite significant developments, there remain several challenges for realizing direct NAATs with user-friendliness, consistency, and generalizability. Molecular diagnostics, as the highest-growing segment of all in vitro diagnostic products, truly have great potential for both developed and low-resource areas. researchers continue to seek approvals such as the FDA\u2019s CLIA waivers."}
