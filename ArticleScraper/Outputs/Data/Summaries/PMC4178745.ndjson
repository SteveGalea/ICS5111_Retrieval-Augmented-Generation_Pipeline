{"summary": "influenza epidemics cause 250,000 to 500,000 deaths worldwide. a related virus, the MERS-CoV, emerged in the middle east in 2012. new cases of MERS-CoV infection continue to be reported in July 2014. host cell factors essential for viral spread but dispensable for cellular survival are attractive targets. several proteases secreted in the lung lumen can activate FLUAV (11\u201313) study of cultured human respiratory epithelium revealed a key role for membrane-associated proteases. work by B\u00f6ttcher and colleagues identified the transmembrane serine proteases TMPRSS2 and HAT as potent activators of FLUAV (15), at least upon engineered expression in cell lines. a different H3N2 virus tested in a separate study was much less dependent on TMPRSS2 expression (19), suggesting that certain H3N2 viruses might be able to usurp another protease to ensure their activation. a different H3N2 virus tested in a separate study was much less dependent on TMPRSS2 expression (19), suggesting that certain H3N2 viruses might be able to usurp another protease to ensure their activation. plasmids encode human TTSPs with amino acid sequences identical to those deposited in the GenBank database. the integrity of all PCR-amplified sequences was verified by automated sequence analysis. the integrity of all PCR-amplified sequences was verified. all samples were denatured for 30 min at 95\u00b0C, separated by SDS-PAGE. the proteins were detected by using a mouse anti-myc antibody (Biomol) as primary antibody and a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-coupled anti-mouse antibody (Dianova) as secondary antibody. cDNA aliquots (1 l) corresponding to 50 ng total RNA equivalents were used for real-time PCR in triplicate 10-l reaction mixtures with the ABI 7500 Fast real-time PCR system. the specific assays were Hs00237175_m1 (TMPRSS2), Hs01070171_m1 (DESC1 = TMPRSS11E), and Hs00361060_m1 (MSPL = TMPRSS the cells were harvested in 1 ml of PBS, treated with PBS or tosylsulfonyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-trypsin (Sigma) at 48 h posttransfection, the cells were harvested in 1 ml of PBS, treated with PBS or tosylsulfonyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-trypsin ( a previously described cell-cell fusion assay was used. 293T effector cells were seeded into 48-well plates at 0.8 105/well. they were transfected with either the empty pCAGGS plasmid or pCAGGS. cell-cell fusion quantified by determination of luciferase activities in cell lysates at 48 h after cocultivation with a commercially available kit (Promega) 293T cells were transiently cotransfected with pNL4-3-LucRE (42) and expression plasmids for SARS-CoV S, MERS-CoV S, HA and neuraminidase. 293T cells were either directly seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 0.8 104/well or first transfected with protease-encoding plasmids. at 12 h posttransduction, fresh medium was added, and at 72 h posttransduction, the cells were lysed and the luciferase activities in cell lysates were determined. DMEM supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) containing A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 or A/Panama/2007/99 (H3N2) at an MOI of 0.1. cells were gently washed with PBS, and fresh infection medium (again without trypsin) was added. the cells were calcium phosphate transfected with plasmids encoding TMPRSS2, TMPRSS3, DESC1 and MSPL. at 16 h posttransfection, the medium was replaced with fresh DMEM. at 24 h posttransfection, the cells were washed with PBS and infected with FLUAV A/PR/8/34. plasmids encoding human transmembrane proteases TMPRSS2, HAT, TMPRSS3, TMPRSS9, and TMPRSS10 were amplified by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR with mRNA prepared from Caco2 (DESC1, MSPL), H1299 (TMPRSS11F), or LNCaP (prostasin, TMPRSS11B) cells. 293T cells were seeded into six-well plates at a density of 2.2 105/well. they were then transfected with plasmids encoding proteases equipped with an N-terminal myc tag or transfected with an empty plasmid as a control. at 16 h posttransfection, the medium was replaced with fresh DMEM. two pools of commercially available RNA (Agilent Technologies) were used to quantify protease expression in the lung. total RNA (1 g) was reverse transcribed with 50 U of BioScript RNase H Low reverse transcriptase. the enzyme was finally inactivated for 10 min at 70\u00b0C. 293T cells were seeded into six-well plates at a density of 2.2 105/well. the cells were cotransfected with an expression plasmid for SARS-CoV S, MERS-CoV S, and HA cleavage by TTSPs. expression of FLUAV HA of the H1 subtype was detected by staining with a mouse monoclonal antibody reactive against the HA of the 1918 H1N1 FLUAV. expression of -actin was detected with an anti-actin antibody (Sigma) expression of -actin was detected with an anti-actin antibody (Sigma) 293T target cells were seeded into 48-well plates at 0.8 105/well. they were transfected with the empty pcDNA3 plasmid or the expression plasmids for ACE2 or CD26. effector cells were detached, diluted in fresh medium, and added to target cells. the culture medium was replaced at 16 h posttransfection, and supernatants were harvested at 48 h posttransfection. the supernatants were passed through 0.45-m filters, aliquoted, and stored at 80\u00b0C. 293T cells were cotransfected with expression plasmids for ACE2 or CD26. 293T cells were seeded into six-well plates at a density of 2.8 105/well. after 24 h, the cells were transfected with 6 g of expression plasmids. the transfection medium was replaced with fresh medium after overnight incubation. cel overlay and 2.5 g/ml N-acetylated trypsin were incubated for 24 h. cells were fixed with 4% formalin in PBS and incubated for 1 h with a goat anti-influenza virus nucleocapsid NP polyclonal antibody (Virostat), followed by 1 h of incubation with a goat anti-influenza virus nucleocapsid NP polyclonal antibody after 1 h of incubation with primary antibodies, cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with FITC-coupled anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Dianova). after three final washing steps, cells were treated with Vectashield 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole mounting medium (Vector Laboratories) and analyzed with a Zeiss LSM 5 laser scanning microscope. image analysis was performed ses studied roughly matched the predicted ones, and bands expected upon autocatalytic activation were seen for all of the proteases except TMPRSS9. a faint signal was consistently observed for TMPRSS9. cleavage of MERS-CoV S was readily detected upon the coexpression of TMPRSS2 and HAT or upon the treatment of S-protein-expressing cells with trypsin. TMPRSS10 did not facilitate the cleavage of SARS-CoV S. expression of MERS-CoV S in effector cells allowed fusion with target cells transfected with a CD26-encoding plasmid but not a control plasmid. expression of TMPRSS2, HAT, DESC1 and MSPL activated MERS-CoV S with the same efficiency as trypsin. TMPRSS10 expression failed to activate MERS-CoV S. effector 293T cells were cotransfected with the pGAL4-VP16 expression plasmid and either the empty plasmid or a MERS- (A) or SARS- (B) CoV S expression plasmid. effector cells were mixed with 293T target cells transfected with plasmids encoding the indicated receptors and proteases and a plasmid encoding luciferase. expression of TMPRSS2 fully rescued MERS-CoV S- and SARS-CoV S-dependent virus-cell fusion from inhibition by MDL 28170. expression of TMPRSS2 fully rescued MERS-CoV S- and SARS-CoV S-dependent virus-cell fusion from inhibition by MDL 28170. luciferase activities in cell lysates were analyzed at 72 h posttransduction. similar results were obtained in two to three independent experiments. c.p.s., counts per second. the cells were then treated with PBS or trypsin. HA cleavage was detected by Western blotting of cell lysates. the HA0 (upper arrow) and HA1 (lower arrow) subunits are indicated. proteases were detected with mouse anti-myc and FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies (red signal) similar results were obtained in three separate experiments. the average PCC measured for three to five cells is shown. no activation of HA was observed when the proteases studied were expressed in viral target cells. in contrast, no activation of HA was observed when the proteases studied were expressed in viral target cells. to address the activation of authentic FLUAV, we examined the spread of TMPRSS2, HAT, DESC1 and MSPL. at 48 h postinfection, viral spread was quantified as release of infectious particles into the culture supernatants. similar results were obtained in two separate experiments. c.p.s., counts per second; ffu, focus-forming units. TTSPs are expressed in transfected 293T cells. for all known human TTSPs, expression in the lung has been reported. for many of these enzymes it is unknown if they can cleave and activate viral glycoproteins. TTSP expression was detected by FACS. similar results were obtained in three separate experiments. TTSP levels were measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. DESC1 and MSPL cleave the MERS- and SARS-CoV S proteins. 293T cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding MERS- (A) or SARS- (B) CoV S with a C-terminal V5 tag and plasmids encoding the proteases indicated. expression of -actin in cell lysates was determined as a loading control. effector 293T cells express small amounts of endogenous CD26 (46) both receptor and protease expression levels limit MERS-CoV S-driven cell-cell fusion. cleavage of MERS-CoV S by these proteases results in S protein activation. TMPRSS10 expression failed to activate MERS-CoV S. the results of a representative experiment performed with triplicate samples are shown. similar results were observed in two independent experiments. c.p.s., counts per second. DESC1 and MSPL can activate the MERS- and SARS-CoV S proteins for cell-cell fusion. the proteases indicated were coexpressed in 293T cells with CD26 (for MERS-CoV S-driven transduction, panel A) or ACE2 (for SARS-CoV S-driven transduction, panel B) the cells were transduced with pseudotypes bearing MERS- (A) or SARS- (B) CoV S in the absence of the we assessed their ability to cleave the HA proteins of viruses previously pandemic in humans. the proteases were coexpressed with the HA proteins of A/South Carolina/1/1918 (H1N1), A/Singapore/1/57 (H2N2), and A/Hong Kong/1/1968 (H3N2) in transfected 293T cells. none of the other proteases tested facilitated HA cleavage. TMPRSS3 and HA barely colocalized, although the signals were close. the HA signals correlated well with those of TMPRSS2, DESC1 and MSPL. the cellular localizations of HA and TMPRSS3 overlap extensively, suggesting that these proteases could cleave HA. the average PCC measured for three to five cells from separate experiments is shown. error bars indicate the standard errors of the means. a plasmid encoding the env-deficient lentiviral vector, FLUAV HA and NA, was transfected into 293T cells. TMPRSS2, HAT, DESC1 and MSPL are expressed in the human lung. the proteases indicated were transiently expressed in 293T cells. the cells were infected with FLUAV A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) at an MOI of 0.01. TMPRSS2, MSPL, and DESC1 transcripts were detected in both pools. expression of TMPRSS2 transcripts was most robust, but MSPL transcripts were readily detectable. TMPRSS2, MSPL, and, to a lower degree, DESC1 are expressed in the lung and could thus facilitate the pulmonary spread of FLUAV and CoVs in human patients. the absence of TMPRSS2 had a much less profound effect in the context of infection with an H3N2 virus (19), suggesting that certain FLUAVs might employ TTSPs other than TMPRSS2 to ensure their activation in the host. this suggests that certain FLUAVs might employ TTSPs other than TMPRSS2 to ensure their activation in the host. TTSPs are synthesized as zymogens, and several can transit into an active form upon autocatalytic activation. TMPRSS2 was previously shown to activate the S proteins for cathepsin B/L-independent host cell entry. cleavage of the MERS- and SARS-CoV S proteins by HAT has also been reported. cleavage of the protease was shown to activate the S protein for cell-cell fusion. why MSPL, DESC1 and HAT failed to promote SARS-CoV S-driven virus-cell fusion is unclear. TTSPs can cleave and activate the SARS- and MERS-CoV S proteins. however, the analysis of the cleavage fragments indicates that this might not be the case. both trypsin and HAT cleave SARS-CoV S at R667 (35) binding of SARS-CoV S to its receptor may induce subtle conformational changes in the S protein that increase its protease sensitivity. we can thus not exclude the possibility that slightly different S protein processing products would be generated in a cell system expressing high levels of receptor. the cleavage rates might be different and might determine whether a protease can support viral spread in the host. if DESC1 and MSPL contribute to viral spread in the infected host remains to be determined. knockout mice, as well as specific protease inhibitors, might be useful tools for these endeavors."}
