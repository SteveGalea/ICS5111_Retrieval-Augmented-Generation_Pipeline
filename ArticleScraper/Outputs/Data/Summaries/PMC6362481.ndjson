{"summary": "a retrospective cross-sectional study involving 15,323 subjects underwent the annual check-up in the department of Family Medicine of Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University from January 2017 to June 2017. nine variables, including age, gender, body mass index, hypertension, history of cardiovascular disease or stroke, family history of diabetes, physical activity, work-related stress, and salty food preference, were considered. diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease that affects a large portion of the population with a steadfast increase in prevalence of diabetes globally. the number of people with diabetes has risen from 108 million in 1980 to 422 million in 2014 and will place diabetes as the seventh leading cause of death in 2030. the decision tree technique was widely used in the medical field in making diagnostic approaches during clinical practice. the aim of the present study was to employ a decision tree method as a support system by rapid and automated identification of individuals with potential diabetes. 94 (50.6%) 2622 (29.6%) 0.001 Female 776 (49.4%) 6244 (70.4%) BMI 25 540 (34.4%) 7322 (82.6%) 0.001 25 1030 (65.6%) 1572 (17.7%) 0.001 Nonhypertension 1108 (70.6%) 7294 (82.3%) Salty food preference No 629 (40.1%) 7208 (81.3%) 0.001 Yes 941 (59.9%) 1658 (18.7%) History of cardiovascular disease or stroke anthropometric information contain body mass index (BMI) and hypertension. a BMI 25 was defined as overweight; hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure 90 mmHg. the final database consisted of 10 variables which were divided into 9 input variables and one target variable. the target variable consists of two classes, the presence of diabetes or no diabetes. a tree was constructed to model the classification process based on the best informative attribute of the algorithm. a chi-square test was used to compare the categorical characteristics between the nondiabetes and diabetes groups. a receiver operating characteristic graph can be described as the probability of the classifier to rank a randomly selected positive case higher than a randomly selected negative case. 6244 (70.4%) BMI 25 540 (34.4%) 7322 (82.6%) 0.001 25 1030 (65.6%) 1572 (17.7%) 0.001 Nonhypertension 1108 (70.6%) 7294 (82.3%) Salty food preference No 629 (40.1%) 7208 (81.3%) 0.001 Yes 941 (59.9%) 1658 (18.7%) History of cardiovascular disease or stroke No 1311 (83.5%) 8169 (92.1%) 0.001 Yes 259 (16.5%) 697 anthropometric information contain body mass index (BMI) and hypertension. hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure 90 mmHg. each medical report was marked as either diabetes or nondiabetes accordingly. a tree was constructed to model the classification process based on the best informative attribute of the algorithm. at each iteration, the attribute was selected with the maximum gain ratio as the splitting attribute. the final dataset, consisting of 10,436 records, was randomly categorized into two groups. a chi-square test was used to compare categorical characteristics between nondiabetes and diabetes groups. a receiver operating characteristic graph is a technique for visualizing, organizing, and selecting classifiers based on their performance. the area under the ROC curve can be described as the probability of the classifier to rank a randomly selected positive case higher than a randomly selected negative case. then class: person is diabetic (89) R3: IF age 34 and BMI 25 and without a family history of diabetes, THEN class: person is nondiabetic (576) R5: IF 34 age 49 and BMI 25 without a family history of diabetes, with work-related stress, and without physical activity, THEN class: person is nondiabetic (21) R6: IF 34 age 49 and BMI 25, without a family history of diabetes, without work IF age > 49 and BMI 25 and with work-related stress, THEN class: person is nondiabetic (275) R14: IF age > 49 and BMI 25, without physical activity, with salty food preference, and with work-related stress, THEN class: person is nondiabetic (275) R15: IF age > 49 and BMI 25, without physical activity, with salty food preference, without work-related stress, and with hypertension, THEN class: person the precision and recall values for the model were 94.0% and 94.2% respectively, which were significantly balanced. the decision tree showed that among those participants with age 49, 5497 participants (97%) of the individuals were identified as nondiabetic, while age > 49, 771 participants (50%) were identified as nondiabetic. age plays a dominant role on the potential development of diabetes by serving as a single but the most discriminatory attribute to diabetes. secondary to age, BMI also stood out as another critical predictive attribute. the work-related stress was an important predictive factor for those with age younger than 49. several large-scale trials have demonstrated the benefits of preventing diabetes with simple lifestyle interventions. it could render the progression of the disease to be less aggressive in its development as well as less expensive to both households with individuals with diabetes and the health care system. conflict of interest The authors declare no conflict of interest. the work has not been published elsewhere."}
