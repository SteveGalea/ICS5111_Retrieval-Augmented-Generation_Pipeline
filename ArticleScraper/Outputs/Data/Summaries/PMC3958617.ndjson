{"summary": "zoonoses are diseases that are transmissible from animals to humans. 60% of emerging infectious disease agents in humans are of zoonotic origin (1, 2). bats are one of the most successful and diverse mammalian orders on the earth (3). DBatVir is built as a sequence-centric database to retrieve all known sequences of bat-associated animal viruses from the public domain. the databases were downloaded and parsed using in-house bioPerl scripts to generate readable profiles for further expert review. search tool (BLAST) program was integrated into DBatVir web interface. jsPhyloSVG library was also included for the visualization of the phylogenetic trees on the web page. all information from the database is presented in a single desktop-like main page. web interface is considered one of the most important aspects of a good database. we built a highly responsive and intuitive user interface by advanced JavaScript programming to provide users with the look and feel of a desktop application rather than a traditional web page. the table is expandable with a double click to show additional information, such as virus detection method, detailed sampling location, GenBank accessions and length of related sequences. mobile buttons are provided on the bottom toolbar to export the grid as local Excel tables. a global map with markers color-coded by number of bat-associated viruses detected in each country is also available. a submenu with a geographic category organized by continents and countries is provided in the menu panel for convenient regional bat-associated virus analyses. to date, 570 and 553 bat-associated viruses were detected from 19 counties of africa and 17 countries of Europe. text search enables users to extract information from the database quickly. a configurable query form is available for advanced users to perform customized complex searches of all information in the database. feces and swabs are widely investigated samples of bats. cross-links to corresponding sequences in GenBank and DBatVir are provided for all hits in the output. users can customize sequences to be included in follow-up phylogenetic analyses according to their similarities with the query sequence to avoid potential redundancy. the current data show that the predominant virus families detected in insectivorous and frugivorous bats are Rhabdoviridae and Paramyxoviridae. this implies the potential association between bat's diet and the associated virome. the content panel contains multiple different tabs. each column is movable and scalable (or hidden) by dragging and dropping it on the title. statistical pie charts available for easy online analyses. the most widely distributed virus among bats is coronavirus, which has been detected from all the 10 bat families studied to date. the bat family Vespertilionidae has been involved in 20 of the 23 virus families detected in bats so far. paramyxoviridae 1 1 7 23 262 13 23 330 Parvoviridae 8 4 24 43 79 Picornaviridae 1 3 12 16 Polyomaviridae 1 15 2 6 7 2 33 Poxviridae 1 1 2 Reoviridae 2 7 2 32 43 Retroviridae 1 4 6 1 12 Rhabdoviridae 6 360 196 77 8 1590 2237 Totiviridae 1 1 Total 46 4 426 19 text search enables extracting virus information using any querying keywords. a configurable query form is available for advanced users to perform customized complex searches of all information in the database. four to five genetically distinct virus strains of henipaviruses have been detected with different virological and biological properties. users can customize sequences to be included in follow-up phylogenetic analyses according to their similarities with the query sequence to avoid potential redundancy. knowledge of viral hosts enables the identification of maintenance populations from which epidemics may emerge. effective prediction of future viral zoonoses requires an in-depth understanding of the heterologous viral population in key animal species. the importance of bats as natural hosts for several important viral agents, including rabies virus, ebola virus, marburg virus, Hendra virus, Nipah virus and SARS coronavirus, has been established. DBatVir collects information on 4176 bat-associated animal viruses of 23 virus families detected from 196 bat species in 69 countries worldwide funding for open access charge: national major science and technology project of china. conflict of interest declared."}
