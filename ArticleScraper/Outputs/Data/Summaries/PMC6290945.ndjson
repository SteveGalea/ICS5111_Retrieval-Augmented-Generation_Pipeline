{"summary": "scientific knowledge on the Subject Club cells have been extensively studied in the murine lung. little is known about the biology or ontogeny of club cells in the human airways. supervised analysis took advantage of SCGB1A1 as a unique marker for club cells. airway epithelial BC air\u2013liquid interface culture was performed using primary purified BC. TaqMan and morphologic studies (transmission electron microscopy [TEM], immunohistochemistry) were done using conventional methods. single-cell sequencing was used to assess the transcriptome of SAE cells brushed from three healthy individuals. unsupervised clustering identified four different cell populations with signature genes. clusters 1, 3, and 4 highly expressed KRT5 (BC), SCGB1A1 (club), and DNAI1 (ciliated) cells; cluster 3, green dots, 67 single cells; cluster 4, purple dots, 15 single cells. blue represents relative expression of markers shown above the figures. y-axis is principal component 1 (PC1), x-axis is PC2 and x-axis is PC2. 5+SCGB1A1+ cells were small and flat and had a small cytoplasm/nucleus ratio. the brushed SAE showed 5.5 2.0% KRT5+SCGB1A1, 4.1 1.1% KRT5+SCGB1A1+, and 24.2 4.4% KRT5SCGB1A1+. the data represent assessment of a total of 4,691 cells from nine healthy nonsmokers. the data represent assessment of a total of 4,691 cells from nine healthy nonsmokers (mean SEM) 114 single cells from unsupervised clusters 1 and 3 were analyzed. mRNA levels of the BC marker KRT5 mRNA dramatically decreased during BC differentiation on the ALI. expression of other BC signature genes decreased as BC differentiation progressed. expression of club cell signature genes increased as BC differentiation progressed. in vitro demonstration that basal cells (BCs) are progenitor cells for club cells in the human small airway epithelium. the appearance over time of the MUC5B+ cells tracks with SCGB1A1+ cells. the relative negative control subjects for C\u2013E are shown in Figures E5A\u2013E5C. TEM analysis of the ALI cultures demonstrated cells at Day 0 with characteristics of BC (Figures E4D\u2013E4H), but at the end of ALI culture (Day 28), cells were identified with the classic morphologic characteristics of club cells (short microvilli, electron-dense granules) cells were identified with the classic morphologic characteristics of club cells. n are the numbers of single cells expressing the markers SCGB1A1 (club cells), KRT5 (basal cells), DNAI1 (ciliated cells), and MUC5AC (mucin-secreting cells) prior knowledge regarding the biology of human SAE club cells is based on assessment of human lung sections using morphologic techniques to assess candidate genes. the most commonly expressed transcription factors have broad roles in transcriptional regulation (HMGB1 [high-mobility group box 1], FOS [Fos proto-oncogene], BTF3 [basic transcription factor 3], EGR1 [early growth response 1], ATF4 [activating transcription factor 4], and NFE2L2 (hes-related family bHLH transcription factor with YRPW motif 1). single-cell transcriptome analysis of SCGB1A1+ club cells showed some heterogeneity. transcriptome identified several novel host defense-related club cell functions. chemoattractant cytokines (CXCL17, dendritic cells; CXCL1 and CXCL6, neutrophils); genes with immune-related functions. 1A, member 1 (uteroglobin) 100.0 17.5 Cytokines CXCL17 Chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 6 56.8 7.4 Immune function C3 Complement component 3 81.1 9.9 CD46 Complement regulatory protein 78.4 6.4 CD55 Complement decay accelerating factor 81.1 7.2 B2M -2-Microglobulin 94.6 12.3 PIGR Polymeric immunoglobulin receptor 83.8 13.1 TLR tochrome P450, family 2, subfamily B, polypeptide 6 29.7 6.1 GSTT1 Glutathione S-transferase theta 1 45.9 7.2 Antiprotease SERPINA1 Serpin peptidase inhibitor, clade A (alpha-1 antiproteinase, antitrypsin), member 1 24.3 4.8 SLPI Secretory leukocyte peptidase inhibitor 94.6 15.6 WFDC2 WAP four club cells express genes that, when mutated, are causative of cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia, hereditary bronchiectases, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, Birt-Hogg-Dub\u00e9 syndrome, cutis laxa, lymphangioleiomyomatosis, and fibrotic lung diseases. clade A (alpha-1 antitrypsin), member 1 24.3 4.8 Birt-Hogg-Dub\u00e9 syndrome FLCN Folliculin 51.4 2.9 Cutis laxa LTBP4 Latent transforming growth factor \u2013binding protein 4 32.4 4.7 Lymphangioleiomyomatosis TSC1 Tuberous sclerosis 1 43.2 4.6 TSC2 Tuberous sclerosis 2 37.8 6.9 Loeys-Dietz syndrome SM club cells express known viral receptors, including group C adenoviruses and respiratory pathogens associated with lung disease in immunocompromised individuals. Interestingly, single-cell transcriptome analysis identified that club cells express known viral receptors. ctin cell adhesion molecule 4 Measles virus 64.9 6.5 DPP4 Dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 Human coronavirus 54.1 5.6 TNFRSF14 Tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 14 Herpes simplex virus 1, 2 48.6 5.2 SIVA1 SIVA1 apoptosis-inducing factor Coxsackievirus B3 35.1 6.7 IDE Insulin-degrading enzyme Varicella TEM analysis of the brushed SAE identified a unique cell population with mucin-secreting (goblet-like) morphology, club cell\u2013like electron-dense granules, and mucin-producing cell characteristic large light staining granules. transcriptome analysis also identified SCGB1A1+DNAI1+ cells (Figure 6), suggesting the possibility of an ontologic link between club cells and ciliated cells. cells expressed \u201cintermediate\u201d levels of the KRT5+ BC \u201csignature genes\u201d (Figure 7B) also, KRT5+SCGB1A1+ cell expression of SCGB1A1+ club cell \u201csignature genes\u201d was intermediate between the KRT5+SCGB1A1 BC (low expression) and KRT5SCGB1A1+ club cells (high expression) analysis of the transcriptome of KRT5+SCGB1A1+ \u201cintermediate cell\u201d genes identified the genes club cells have a characteristic apical dome shape, microvilli, dense cytoplasmic granules, extensive endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. club cells express cytokines that attract dendritic cells and neutrophils. club cells express genes that function in xenobiotic metabolism. club cells express alpha-1 antitrypsin, the most important antineutrophil elastase inhibitor. club cells express several genes that function in cell\u2013cell and cell\u2013matrix interactions. club cells express several ion channel genes, including epithelial Na+ channel, voltage-dependent anion channels, and water channels. club cells compose 20% of the SAE (5). club cells express receptors for several respiratory tract viruses. transcriptome data showed club cells express receptors for several respiratory tract viruses. BC represent 5\u201310% of the cells in the human SAE. club cells represent approximately 20% (5, 48) to identify relationship between human SAE BC and club cells in vivo. a small subset of SCGB1A1+ cells were not KRT5+ at day 7 of ALI culture. these cells might be the \u201cearly mature club cells\u201d generated from KRT5+ BC before day 7 of ALI culture. a subset of SCGB1A1+ cells were not KRT5+ at day 7 of ALI culture. transcriptome analysis suggests that human club cell might have an ontologic relationship with mucin-secreting cells based on the coexpression of club cell marker SCGB1A1 and mucin-secreting goblet cell marker MUC5AC. goblet cell hyperplasia is one of the common features for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease."}
