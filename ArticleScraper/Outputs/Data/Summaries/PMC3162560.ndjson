{"summary": "networks enable studying properties of complex systems that emerge from interactions between individual parts. networks have been used to model and analyze real-world phenomena in numerous domains. we focus on molecular interaction networks. analyzing PPI network topology is expected to uncover new biology. prediction of protein function [25]\u2013[27] and role of protein networks in disease [1], [28]\u2013[32] have received attention in the post-genomic era. however, there is still a debate about whether network properties of \u201cbiologically central\u201d genes or proteins exhibit some \u201ctopological centrality\u201d compared to the rest of the proteins in the PPI network. degree alone might be a weak measure of network topology, as it captures limited network topology, i.e., only direct neighborhood of a node [27], [31], [40]. a similar controversy arose when cancer genes were initially shown to have greater connectivities and centralities compared to non-cancer genes. it was later demonstrated that most of disease genes do not show a tendency to code for proteins that are hubs [29] graphlets are induced, meaning they contain all edges between the nodes of the subgraph that are present in the large network. this measure generalizes the degree of a node that counts the number of different graphlets that the node touches, for all 2\u20135-node graphlets. this is an effective measure: going to distance of 4 around a node captures a large portion of a network due to the small-world nature of many real networks. we define as biologically central (BC) the genes that belong to one of the following four gene categories: aging (A) genes, cancer (C) genes, HIV-interacting (HIV) genes, and pathogen-interacting (PI) genes. we use terms \u201cgene\u201d and \u201cprotein\u201d interchangeably to define \u201ctopological centrality\u201d: graphlet degree centrality and domination. GDC counts an edge that a node touches many times, as a 2-edge closed walk (going from node A to node B along edge AB and returning from B to A twice), as a 6-edge closed walk (going from A to B and back to A three times) and in a more rigorous way, GDC counts the edge only once and only as an edge. both proteins have the same GDC and are ranked as top genes with respect to DC. a dominating set is a set of nodes such that every node in the network is either in the DS or is a direct neighbor of a node in the DS. the challenge is to identify a minimum order DS, a DS of the minimum size (i.e., the minimum number of nodes) we test connected DSs by constructing a dominating set in the human PPI network. we are interested in connected DSs only since signaling pathways are connected. other algorithms for finding connected DSs are used in telecommunications. this is the first study that uses dominating sets to analyze PPI networks. we define as biologically central (BC) the genes that belong to one of the following four gene categories: aging (A) genes, cancer (C) genes, HIV-interacting (HIV) genes, and pathogen-interacting (PI) genes. we propose a new centrality measure, graphlet degree centrality (GDC), to measure the density and complexity of nodes' neighborhoods. GDC ranks highly a low-degree gene if its 4-deep neighborhood is dense. it gives a low rank to a high-degree gene if its 4-deep neighborhood is sparse. the degree centrality (DC) does not measure topological denseness at all. the most discriminative measure would have all of the most central genes to be BC genes. the most discriminative measure would have all of the most central genes to be BC genes. the most discriminative measure would have all the most central genes to be BC genes. the challenge is to identify a minimum order DS, a DS of the minimum size (i.e., the minimum number of nodes) we hypothesize that a good DS algorithm might capture a set of proteins in a PPI network that are involved in important biological processes and mechanisms crucial for cell vitality. we apply DS algorithms to the human PPI network [28] and measure the size of the resulting DSs. the enrichments in BC and SP genes of nodes of DSs are statistically significant, while those of nodes outside of DSs are not. DSs capture biologically vital proteins and also drug targets. biologically central (BC) genes that we analyze include: aging, cancer, HIV, and pathogen-interacting genes. the data are downloaded in 2009 and 2010. in the human PPI network, there are 2,101 BC genes. the overlap is low and there are only 20 BC genes that are simultaneously aging, cancer, HIV, and PI genes. in the human PPI network, there are 2,253 SP genes, 911 of which are also BC genes. Graphlets are small, connected, induced, non-isomorphic subgraphs of a large network (Figure 3 A) [47], [47]. Previously, we generalized the degree of a node into the graphlet degree vector (GDV), that counted how many graphlets of a given type, such as a triangle or a square, the node touched. Graphlets, automorphism orbits, and GDVs contain 73 coordinates. they contain 15 topologically unique node types, called automorphism orbits, denoted by 0, 1, 2,..., 14. in a particular graphlet, nodes belonging to the same orbit are of the same shade. algorithms for finding dominating sets Let (,) be a network, where is the set of nodes of and is the set of edges of. a dominating set (DS) of graph is a subset of the nodes such that for all nodes, either or a neighbor of is in. a white node that is connected to most other white nodes is taken from, colored black meaning that it is a \u201cdominator\u201d and added to. in phase 2, a gray node from that is connected to the largest number of black nodes in is selected, colored dark gray meaning it is a \u201cconnector\u201d and added to. the algorithm then checks whether node set is connected and if so, it stops. in phase 1, nodes 1, 4, 8, 12, and 16 are colored black as members of an independent DS. in phase 2, nodes 2, 9, and 11 are colored dark grey as connectors that connect nodes in the independent DS resulting from phase 1. in phase 3, the connected DS resulting from phase 2 is pruned to reduce it size by removing node 16 from the DS. a node with the minimum degree in removes from only if the DS defined on remains a connected DS of G, and repeats the above steps for all nodes in order of their increasing degrees. DS-DC results in a smaller DS than DS-RAI (the same holds for real-world PPI networks, as demonstrated in Section 0). biologically central (BC) genes that we analyze include: aging, cancer, HIV, and pathogen-interacting genes. in the human PPI network, there are 2,101 BC genes in total. aging genes, 887 are cancer genes, 1,132 are HIV genes, and 500 are PI genes. the overlap is low and there are only 20 BC genes that are simultaneously aging, cancer, HIV, and PI genes. Graphlets are small, connected, induced, non-isomorphic subgraphs of a large network. the degree of a node is the first coordinate in a graphlet, since an edge is the only 2-node graphlet. a total of 73 orbits in all 2\u20135-node graphlets. all 9 graphlets contain 2, 3 and 4 nodes, denoted by,,...,. they contain 15 topologically unique node types, called automorphism orbits, denoted by 0, 1, 2,..., 14. in a particular graphlet, nodes belonging to the same orbit are of the same shade. degree centrality (DC) of a node is the number of its neighbors, i.e., its degree. degree centrality (DC) of a node is the percentage of all shortest paths between and in the network that go through the node of interest. Graphlets are small, connected, induced, non-isomorphic subgraphs of a large network. Previously, we generalized the degree of a node into the graphlet degree vector (GDV) that counted how many graphlets of a given type, such as a triangle or a square, the node touched. a total of 73 orbits in all 2\u20135-node graphlets. a new graphlet degree centrality measure measures the density of the node's extended network neighborhood. for a node, we denote by the coordinate of its GDV, i.e., is the number of times node touches an orbit. for each orbit, we count how many orbits affect it. the cardinality of a minimum dominating set of graph, is called the domination number of G. it has been shown that for graph with nodes: (1) where () is the maximum node degree in G. a subset of is said to be an independent set if no two vertices in are adjacent. in phase 2, a gray node from that is connected to the largest number of black nodes in is selected, colored dark gray meaning it is a \u201cconnector\u201d and added to. the algorithm then checks whether node set is connected and if so, it stops. otherwise, the algorithm selects the next gray node from that is connected to the largest number of black nodes in. DS-DC (black nodes in panel B) is smaller than the DS produced by DS-RAI (black and dark grey nodes in panel A) the algorithm breaks all ties uniformly at random. the average DS size over the 30 runs is nodes, out of which 1,711 appear in all of the 30 DSs, any DS is representative of all of them. a given protein set of size, we measure its enrichment in BC (and SP) genes. we compute the statistical significance (-value) of observing a given enrichment by measuring the probability that the same enrichment would be observed in a randomly chosen set of proteins in the PPI network. precision and recall cross for aging genes in the human PPI network. we compute the BC gene enrichments of central and non-central genes. if we choose lower, e.g., 1%, precision is even higher. the top 1% (i.e., 91) GDC-central genes. the top 1% (i.e., 91) GDC-central genes. the top 1% (i.e., 91) GDC-central genes. enrichments in drug targets are higher for GDC-central BC genes. these enrichments are statistically significant for non-GDC-central BC genes. for non-GDC-central BC genes they are not, with -values. we compare its performance against the performance of the other centrality measures. the values of AUPRs for GDC are 0.27 for A, 0.2 for C, 0.34 for HIV, and 0.2 for PI genes. for PI genes, AUPRs for SC are the highest, followed by AUPRs for DC, DC, and BWC respectively. AUPRs for gDC are statistically significant: we compute, at each value of recall, the probability of observing a given number of BC genes among % of randomly chosen genes are in the range for DS-RAI, DS-DC, and DS-GC algorithms produce smaller DSs. each of them produces a DS that captures a huge portion of the DS produced by DS-RAI. each of them produces a DS that captures a huge portion of the DS produced by DS-RAI. BC and SP genes that are in the DS should contain more drug targets than BC and SP genes that are not in the DS. enrichments in drug targets are much higher for BC and SP genes that are in the DS than for BC and SP genes that are not in the DS. GO terms are statistically significantly enriched in 153 MF, 574 BP, and 44 CC GO terms. non-DS-central genes are statistically significantly enriched in 7 MF, 7 BP, and 0 CC GO terms. central genes appear to group by functions that are different than functions of non-central genes. the notion of network domination seems to capture the topology required for passing cellular signals efficiently throughout the network. we hypothesize that targeting GDC-central proteins with drugs would have more significant impacts on the network than targeting proteins that reside in sparse and non-complex network regions. the enrichment in drug targets of genes that are simultaneously GDC-central and are in the DS is even higher, it is 31.7%. the observed enrichments are statistically significant for GDC-central genes, while for non-GDC-central genes they are not. (4) GDC outperforms other centrality measures in the sense that it uncovers the largest number of BC genes among the most central genes. a new and simpler DS algorithm that outperforms the existing algorithm on our data. GDC captures BC genes For each of the four centralities (DC, BWC, SC, and GDC) we measure how many BC genes they contain. we measure how many cancer genes (C) are in the top 1%, the top 2%, the top 3% etc. most central genes with respect to each of the four centrality measures. enrichments in each of the four BC gene categories are much higher for central and non-central genes. these enrichments are statistically significant for central genes, with -values, while for non-central genes they are not, with -values. if we choose lower, e.g., 1%, precision is even higher (although recall is lower) the top 1% (i.e., 91) GDC-central genes. if a gene is an aging (\u201cA\u201d), cancer (\u201cC\u201d), HIV (\u201cHIV\u201d), or pathogen-interacting (\u201cPI\u201d) gene, there is an \u201cX\u201d in the corresponding entry. we measure the enrichment in drug targets of BC genes. GDC always outperforms DC, confirming our hypothesis that GDC could capture the biological signal better. SC also outperforms DC for aging genes, but interestingly not for HIV and PI genes. the results obtained from AUPRs corresponding to different centrality measures are mostly consistent with the results obtained at selected thresholds. the number of positive examples (here, the known BC genes) is much smaller than the number of negative examples (here, all proteins in the network that are currently not known to be BC genes) AUPRs are likely to increase as this happens. the observed AUPRs are statistically significant. the enrichments for the DS are statistically significant, with -values, while for non-DS they are not, with -values. we measure the enrichment in drug targets of BC and SP genes that are in the DS. these enrichments for the BC and SP genes that are in the DS are statistically significant, with -values. for SP and BC genes that are not in the DS they are not, with -values. central genes appear to group by functions that are different than functions of non-central genes. the notion of network domination seems to capture the topology required for passing cellular signals efficiently throughout the network. the notion of network domination seems to capture the topology required for passing cellular signals efficiently throughout the network. the notion of network domination seems to capture the topology required for passing cellular signals efficiently throughout the network. the enrichment in drug targets of genes that are simultaneously GDC-central and are in the DS is even higher, it is 31.7%; this enrichment is also statistically significant, with -value of 0.. each of the two concepts of topological centrality, GDC and DS, captures a statistically significant percentage of drug targets. a DS of a PPI network found by a very simple algorithm captures biologically vital proteins. the enrichments in BC and SP genes are much higher for nodes of DSs than for nodes outside of DSs. the observed enrichments are statistically significant for nodes of DSs."}
