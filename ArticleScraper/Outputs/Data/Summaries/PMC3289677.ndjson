{"summary": "noVs are non-enveloped, polyadenylated, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses. they represent a distinct genus in the family Caliciviridae. GI, GII and GIV NoVs infect humans, with GII NoVs accounting for the majority of human infections. coronavirus, parvovirus, astrovirus, adenovirus, rotavirus and vesiviruses (feline calicivirus, FCV) have been identified in the stools of cats. there is limited information on their role as enteric pathogens [10]\u2013[13]. cats were located in single cages and feces were identified individually with an alpha-numeric code. the fecal samples, collected during this study, were negative for common feline parasites. RNA extraction A 10% fecal suspension in 0.01 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2) was made. the debris were removed by centrifugation at 16000 g for 3 min. the 275 nt fragment showed 94% nt identity to the lion NoV/GIV.2/Pistoia-387/06/IT, confirming the diagnosis of NoV infection. the 3\u2032 end of the genome (3500 bp) was amplified with a 3\u2032-RACE protocol [18] using specific reverse primers (FNoV-R1 and FNoV-R2) and the forward primer P1210, targeting the NTPase region [19 1 + 4480\u20134503 GGTTATTAAGGCCGCTTGACAT A This study FNoV-R1 4659\u20134681 GGCTGAGAGTGTAAATCCAGT A This study FNoV-F2 + 4507\u20134530 GGTTAAATTCTCTGCCGAACCCGA A This study P1210 + 1610\u20131632 GGICMICCIGGIWKIGGIAARAC A [19] FNoV-F3 + 5143\u20135163 CG this study FNoV-R11 424\u2013446 GTTTGACTTCACGCTCAGACAGG A This study FNoV-R12 2099\u20132115 GTGTTGCCTTGTC S This study FNoV-R14d 7067\u20137088 CYT GGT TRT ACC CAA ACT CCA C A This study FNoV-R15 4970\u20134993 CTG ATG GTT GGG TCC TCT GGT CCA A This study P290d + DNA sequencing was performed using BigDye Terminator Cycle chemistry and an automated sequencer ABI Prism 3100XL (Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA) Sequence editing, assembling and alignment were performed using BioEdit Sequence Analysis Editor (version 7.0.9.0) Primers FNoV-F9 and FNoV-R15 were designed to amplify a 338-bp amplicon at the 3\u2032end RdRp region. the assay was performed using the QIAGEN one-step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA) the amplification program included 50\u00b0C for 30 min, 95\u00b0C for 15 min, 35 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 30 sec, 57\u00b0C for 30 the OSU cat specimens were collected from animals of different ages (4 months to 8 years old) during the period of hospitalization, cats were located in single cages and feces were collected directly from the cat litter and identified individually with an alpha-numeric code. the fecal samples, collected during this study, were negative for common feline parasites. RNA extraction A 10% fecal suspension in 0.01 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2) was made. the debris were removed by centrifugation at 16000 g for 3 min. the amplicons were purified after gel excision with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA) and sequenced directly from both directions. the three samples displayed 94% nt identity to the lion NoV/GIV.2/Pistoia-387/06/IT, confirming the diagnosis of NoV infection. the 3\u2032 end of the genome (3500 bp) was amplified with a 3\u2032-RACE Oligonucleotide Polarity Positiona Sequence (5\u2032 to 3\u2032)b Notec Reference FNoV-F1 + 4480\u20134503 GGTTATTAAGGCCGCTTGACAT A This study FNoV-F2 + 4507\u20134530 GGTTAAATTCTCTGCCGAACCCGAA A This study P1210 + 1610\u20131632 GGICMICCIGGIWKIGGIAARAC A [19] FNoV-F3 + 5143\u2013 680\u2013699 GCACTCTACAAACTCAATGG S This study FNoV-R9 532\u2013554 ACATCTCGAGGATGGAGCCAG A This study FNoV-R11 424\u2013446 GTTTGACTTCACGCTCAGACAGG A This study FNoV-R12 2099\u20132115 GTGTTGCCTTTTGTC S This study FNoV-R14d 7067\u20137088 CYT GGT TRT ACC CAA RT-PCR or PCR products were purified using the gel purification kit. cloned into pCR-XL-TOPO vector for sequencing. DNA sequencing was performed using BigDye Terminator Cycle chemistry and an automated sequencer ABI Prism 3100XL. the full length genome sequence of the feline NoV CU081210E/US was deposited in GenBank with accession number JF781268. RT-PCR specific for feline NoV was developed based on the cat and lion NoV sequences. primers FNoV-F9 and FNoV-R15 were designed to amplify a 338-bp amplicon at the 3\u2032end RdRp region. only 3 samples (CU081210E, CU081210J and CU081210M) showed a band of the expected size for NoV (319 bp) the other 5 samples showed a band of 331 bp and were confirmed as FCV by sequence analysis. a 3.5 kb fragment was obtained only for strain CU081210E. the newly identified feline noV CU081210E/10/USA is in bold. the newly identified feline noV CU081210E/10/USA is in bold. the ORF1 encodes the non-structural polyprotein with a predicted size of 1747 aa. a selection of 72 partial sequences of the RdRp (250 aa) of noVs was retrieved from GenBank. identity was calculated on a selection of 181 NoV capsid sequences. identity to non-GIV NoVs was 36.7\u201354.5% aa. identity to human GIV NoVs was much lower (44% aa) identity to lion and dog strains was 97.1% and 86.3% aa. RT-PCR for the detection of feline NoVs Using the sequences obtained in the study, a new diagnostic RT-PCR was developed. 3 additional samples tested positive to NoV from the collection B, but none from collection A. 6 out of 14 feline diarrheic samples (42.8%) from Cornell University veterinary clinic were positive for NoV. a 3.5 kb fragment (from the 3\u2032end of ORF1 through the poly-A tail) was obtained only for strain CU081210E. the highest nt identity was found to GI, GII, GIII and GV NoV. identity to other caliciviruses ranged from 29.3 to 34.5%. nucleotide sequence 37,6\u201341,5 45,5\u201349,8 36,7\u201337,4 68,2\u201368,5 97,9 90,4 36,9 50,2\u201354,5 Amino acid sequence ORF3 26,6\u201328,2 39,0\u201347,8 31,9\u201332,9 58,4\u201359,3 93,9 72,9 25,2 46,3\u201347,2 Nucleotide sequence 25,4\u201330, a selection of 72 partial sequences of the RdRp (250 aa) of noVs was retrieved from GenBank. identity was 98.9% aa and 94.5% nt to the strain lion/Pistoia-387/06/IT. identity to human GIV NoVs was 76\u201378% aa and 69.2\u201370.3% nt. a 20-aa insertion was present in the P2-domain of animal GIV NoVs. identity was high to the lion NoV (96.8% aa and 93.9% nt) and the canine strain Bari-170/07/IT (77.6% aa and 72.9% nt) the sequences of a 2.4 kb-genomic fragment of three additional feline NoV strains (CU081210J, CU081210M, CU081210O) were obtained and compared with the sequence of strain CU081210E. the four feline NoV strains displayed 100% nt identity to each other, suggesting a clonal origin. animals from group B showed enteric symptoms and were young kittens almost of the same age (8 to 12 weeks old) this age period is critical for kittens, since maternally derived antibodies tend to wane and the animals become fully susceptible to various pathogens. a fragment of the RdRp (the 3\u2032end of the ORF1) was used for analysis and comparison with a large selection of NoV strains belonging to all genogroups. this part of the noV genome can be sequenced easily using the 3\u2032-RACE protocol and forward primers designed in conserved aa motives of the RdRp. however, sequence data spanning this region is available for most NoV strains. human GIV.1 NoVs are more related to carnivore GIV.2 NoVs than to other humans noV genogroups (GI and GII), thus suggesting an intersection during the evolution of GIV NoVs. findings pose a challenge for epidemiological studies of feline enteric pathogens."}
