{"summary": "sialic acids (SAs) are usually linked to the outermost capping position of glycans that are conjugated to cell-surface glycoproteins or glycolipids. the conjugation between Gal and SA can be either in the form of an 2,3 or an 2,6 glycosidic linkage. glycan microarray data showed that subterminal sugars affect their binding affinity to these two lectins. for example, MAL-I showed the highest affinity to the SA2\u20133Gal1\u20134GalNAc. cell entry by influenza virus depends on the recognition of a terminal SA-capped glycosylated molecules by the viral hemagglutinin (HA) protein. cells were identified by the staining of biotin-labeled plant lectins. a Taiwan-isolated AIV H6N1 was applied to characterize the cell tropism of AIV. the correlation of the cell tropism of AIV to the SA distribution on CTE cells was also explored. the cellular distribution of SA2\u20133Gal was characterized by the double-staining of biotin-labeled MAA (EY Laboratories, 1500) (A, B, D, G), MAL-1 (E) or MAL-II (both from Vector laboratories, 1500) (C, F, H), indicating that goblet cells may not express the SA2\u20133Gal glycans. 3Gal glycan is not expressed on goblet cells was further evaluated by MAL-II (Vector Laboratories) only 0.330.09 -tubulin+ cells (n = 230) can be labeled with MAL-II. biotin-labeled SNA (Vector Laboratories, 1500) (A\u2013C) and SNA-1 (EY laboratories, 1500) (D) showed no difference to the result of SNA. both MAA and SNA bound to the surfaces of a subpopulation of the K14+ cells. the arrows in A, B and C indicate cells that are triple-positive for K14, MAA and SNA. the cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue) the glycan data are from Ref. [4] and Functional glycomics Gateway: http://www.functionalglycomics.org/static/index.shtml. the glycan data are from Ref. [4] and Functional glycomics Gateway. a total of 5104 CTE cells were infected with AIV H6N1 2838V at a MOI of 0.1 (A\u2013C) or 1 (D\u2013E) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. at 6 h.p.i., infection by H6N1 was detected by chicken H6N1 immune-serum (1500, red) the infectivity of H6N1 in tracheal epithelial cells was further characterized at a MOI of 0.1and 1. ICC results showed that the ciliated cells (Fig. 5D), goblet and basal cells were all susceptible to infection by H6N1 as measured at 6 h.p.i. the cellular distribution of SA2\u20133Gal was characterized by the double-staining of biotin-labeled MAA (EY Laboratories, 1500) (A, B, D, G), MAL-1 (E) or MAL-II (both from Vector laboratories, 1500) (C, F, H) subtypes of SA2\u20133Gal glycans with different subterminal sugars present varied affinity to MAA/MAL-I and MAL-II. we also found that only 0.330.09 -tubulin+ cells (n = 230) can be labeled with MAL-II. mucin (A), K14 (B) and -tubulin (C and D) were the markers for goblet cells, basal cells and ciliated cells. the cellular distribution of SA2\u20136Gal was shown by the double-staining of biotin-labeled SNA (A\u2013C) and SNA-1 (EY laboratories, 1500) (D) the ICC result indicated that MAA and SNA can be co-expressed on single K14+ cells. the tracheal basal cell was identified by the expression of K14 (1100, Convance) (A) the cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue) SNA 2% 85%low SA2\u20136Gal1\u20134GlcNAc AIV H6N1 MOI = 0.1/1 ++/+++ /+ /++ The value of percentage indicates the expressing ratio of cells; high or low indicates the expressing intensity in cells. the ratio of MAA or SNA expression on the infected cells was manually counted from five individual fields (C) the ratio of MAA or SNA expression on the infected cells was manually counted from five individual fields (C) tracheal epithelial cells (A) and the human (A) and chicken (B) expression profiles of SA2\u20133Gal (red dots) and SA2\u20136Gal (blue dots) on the ciliated cells (green), goblet cells (yellow) and basal cells (pink) are illustrated. the infectivity of H6N1 in CTE cells was further characterized at a MOI of 1. all three types of CTE cells express SA2-3Gal in a varied degree. SA2-3Gal showed abundant expression on chicken ciliated cells. but only a detectable level on basal cells. tracheal basal cells are responsible for epithelial recovery. one-third of the goblet cells showed strong MAL-II staining. the expression profiles of SAs on CTE cells exhibit distributions. both ciliated and goblet cells can be labeled with MAA/MAL-I and SNA [20], indicating that both ciliated and goblet cells have both types of influenza viral receptors. al goblet cells [19], [20] and was capped on mucin protein [24] it was also proposed that tracheal mucin in the airway contains SA2\u20133Gal [25] this false-receptor effect may mask the HA of the AIV, disable the viral access to the goblet cells and also account for the hindrance of AIV infection to human goblet cell [26]. chicken tracheal mucin protein and the neutralizing effect of chicken mucin on duck influenza viruses will be an interesting task. genetic mutations or recombinations in the HA of an influenza virus can render interspecies transmission by altering the receptor tropism [27], [28], [29]. the HA 226 residue is critical to cell tropism in human H3 and H9N2 viruses. the residue is critical to cell tropism in human H3, H2, H5 and the avian H6, H9 and H5N1 viruses. these sites in HA are not highly conserved among different influenza viruses. the cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 3 days. the lectins were conjugated with biotin or a green fluorescent dye, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) primary antibodies were -tubulin (1500, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), mucin 5AC (1100, Sigma-Aldrich) and cytokeratin 14 (K14, 1100, Convance, Princeton, NJ, USA) primary culture of CTE cells Tracheas were obtained from one-day-old SPF chicks. tracheas were digested with dispase I solution (2.5 U/ml dispase I, Roche) for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. tracheas were digested with collagenase I (1 mg/ml, Roche) for 5 min at 37\u00b0C. the cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 3 days. immunocytochemistry (ICC) was performed using the biotin-labeled lectins (MAA, MAL I, MAL II, SNA and SNA I, 1500) the used primary antibodies were -tubulin (1500, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), mucin 5AC (1100, Sigma-Aldrich) and cytokeratin 14 (K14, 1100, Convance, Princeton, NJ, USA) ciliated cells (-tubulin+) was characterized by the double-staining of biotin-labeled MAL-1 (Vector laboratories, 1500) arrows in A and B indicate cells with high-intensity MAA and SNA staining."}
