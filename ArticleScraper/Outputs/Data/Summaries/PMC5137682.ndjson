{"summary": "the FBPS of S. suis 2 consists of 552 amino acids. the solved structure unexpectedly contained only FBPS-N. the final model, which is refined to 2.1- resolution, contains 267 amino acids. the potential trypsin recognition site between FBPS-N and FBPS-C is highlighted with a dotted blue box. the n10/n11 hairpin loop is dramatically longer in the FBPA of Staphylococcus aureus than in the FBPS of S. suis. 12.9 (10.2) 15.2 (14.6) 6.5 (3.7) 6.3 (2.3) Total reflections 214,164 202,544 137,034 88,862 Unique reflections 16,622 13,350 21,058 14,070 Refinement Resolution 33.60\u20132.10 38.61\u20132.60 Rwork/Rfree 0.216/0.246 0.219/0.249 No. atoms Protein 2,159 4,001 Water 129 89 B-factors Protein 40.0 58. the secondary elements are labeled according to their occurrence within the structure. the n4/ n5 loop, the n5/n6 loop, and the -hairpin are shorter in FBPS-N than in FnBP-N. -hairpin structure that forms tyrosine-mediated hydrogen bonds (K237\u2013Y264 and Y239\u2013Y265) with the final -helical structure of the FBPS-N (n7). n7 helix is further stabilized by hydrogen bonding to the n4\u2013n2 bridge of domain I. FBPS-N has a fold similar to that in FBPS-N and their overall structures are similar. c1 and c2 are extremely long, with an estimated length of 74 and 64, respectively, and are arranged in a cross shape with an interangle of 20\u00b0 to form a long coiled coil. the final relatively small third helix (c3) of FBPS-C domain I is located on one longitudinal side of the coiled structure, proximal to domain II. the FBPS-N domain II and FBPS-C domain II are on one side. the FBPS-N domain I and FBPS-C domain I are on the other side. fbps gene was knocked out from virulent strain 05ZYH33 (7) to yield mutant strain, fbps. fbps mutant (lanes 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14) was used as templates for PCR analysis. fbps mutant (lanes 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14) was used as templates. FBPS-N binding to FnN30. (E) FBPS-C binding to FnN30. (F) FBPS-C binding to FnN30. (G) a potent binding to immobilized fibronectin was observed for the full-length FBPS. FBPS-C, rather than FBPS-N, represents the predominant domain for fibronectin-binding activity and recognizes the N-terminal fragment of human fibronectin for engagement. results are consistent with a previous study showing that C-terminal truncations of S. pneumoniae PavA cause the protein to lose its capacity for fibronectin interaction. fbps gene restored HEp-2 secretion of IL-6 and -8 by HEp-2 cells. decreased secretion of IL-6 and -8 by HEp-2 cells abolished difference in cytokine levels between WT and complemented strains. ERK and p38 are phosphorylated upon bacterial infection and play an important role in IL-8 production induced by YadA. we also examined whether ERK and p38 are activated by phosphorylation upon bacterial infection. fbps infection also activated ERK and p38, but levels were significantly lower than those observed in the WT strain over the same time period. the final model, which is refined to 2.1- resolution, contains 267 amino acids extending from S2 to K268. the overall structure involves two distinct domains (domains I and II), one extra small helix (n7) and two extremely long loops connecting the domains and the helix. crystallographic data measurement and refinement data Data collection and refinement FBPS-N (native) FBPS-N (SeMet) FBPS-C (native) FBPS-C (SeMet) Data collection Space group P41212 P41212 P21 P21 Cell dimensions a, b, c, () 70.6, 70.6, 110.2 70.5, 70.5, 110.0 40.3, 103.6, 83.3 40.5, 104.1, 84.5,, 129 89 B-factors Protein 40.0 58.9 Water 39.0 58.5 Rmsd Bond lengths 0.013 0.010 Bond angles, degrees 1.215 1.315 Ramachandran plot Most favored region (%) 86.8 91.6 Additionally allowed region (%) 12.0 8.2 Generously allowed region (%) 1.2 0.2 Disallowed region (%) 0 0 * Values for the outmost resolution shell are given in parentheses. the n4/ n5 loop, the n5/n6 loop, and the -hairpin are shorter in FBPS-N than in FnBP-N. the structure can be divided into two domains, which are colored magenta and yellow. nBP-N of S. aureus (PDB ID code 3DOA) resolved by Structural Genomics Consortium that is a homolog of our FBPS-N. Detailed superimposition analysis revealed that domain I is almost exactly the same in FBPS-N and FBPS-N, but domain II is moderately different in the two structures.

FBPS-N and FBPS-C structures have been fitted into the SAXS envelopes of FBPS. the fbps gene was knocked out from the virulent S. suis strain 05ZYH33 (7) to yield a mutant strain, fbps. successful construction of the deletion mutant was confirmed by a PCR-based assay. the elimination of FBPS did not completely abrogate the cell adherence of S. suis. however, a statistically significant decrease in surface attachment to HEp-2 cells was observed for fbps. data are presented as means SD of three independent experiments. data are presented as means SD of three independent experiments. FBPS-C represents the predominant domain for fibronectin-binding activity. a potential binding to immobilized fnN30 was observed for the full-length protein. a negligible interaction was detected for FBPS-N. fbps bacterium also induced rapid expression of IL-6 and -8 in HEp-2 cells but at a decreased level. fbps gene faithfully restored the HEp-2 secretion of IL-6 and -8. phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of ERK (C) and p38 (F) in HEp-2 cells infected with WT or fbps S. suis. phosphorylation was maximally increased 10\u201320 min after infection. deletion of the fbps gene caused a dramatic delay in kinase activation. Known FnBPs can be categorized into two groups: those with an LPXTG motif for surface localization and those lacking similar anchoring motifs. the structure of FBPS was solved in its N- and C-terminal halves, and its full-length architecture in solution was determined by SAXS. FBPS is able to bind to fibronectin and this binding capacity can be largely attributed to the C-terminal half of the protein. however, the observed binding affinity is weaker than that for the other group of FnBPs, which are normally at one- or two-digit nanomolar levels (21). FBPS can activate downstream signaling pathways by phosphorylating ERK and p38 and induce the production of IL-6 and -8 via 1 integrin receptors. a pathogenetic study on GBS revealed that enhanced chemokine expression leads to increased neutrophil infiltration and promotes bacterial dissemination in CNS.
