{"summary": "RIA-grade bovine serum albumin, carbachol, DTT, iodoacetamide, and luminol were from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO), soybean trypsin inhibitor was from Worthington Biochemical Corp. (Malvern, PA), [35S]met/cys mixture was from NEN Life Science Products (Express; Boston, MA) three antisera against rat cathepsin B were used. a rabbit anti-serum raised against the cytosolic tail of the human CI-MPR (III/4) was kindly forwarded by Von Figura. a rabbit anti-serum raised against the cytosolic tail of the human CI-MPR (III/4) was kindly forwarded by Von Figura. mouse-derived antibodies were indirectly marked by protein A\u2013gold via a rabbit anti\u2013mouse IgG bridging antibody. areas of the grid were selected that contained cells exhibiting well-preserved ultrastructure. at a magnification of 20,000, the gold particles were counted randomly. each encountered gold particle was attributed to the compartment over which it was located. 35% of all secretory granules were considered immature. in parotid cells, 485 gold particles were counted for syntaxin 6 and 504 for AP-1. granules for CD-MPR and AP-1 are associated with maturing granules. the granule membrane protein phogrin remains associated with maturing granules. a similar decrease in labeling over maturing granules occurred. the tissue was washed three times for 5\u201310 min each in oxygenated Eagle's modified minimal essential medium plus 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.01% soybean trypsin inhibitor, pH 7.4. all bathing media from subsequent defined chase periods were freshly oxygenated before use, since this was found necessary to maintain secretory performance. soluble lysosomal hydrolase precursors, such as ProB, abundantly enter IGs of cells. immunoreactivity with an antibody against a proinsulin cleavage site is one criterion that can be used to discriminate IGs from mature. immunoelectron microscopy of ultrathin cryosections established CD-MPR (Fig. 1) and AP-1 (Fig. 2, A and B) immunogold labeling over the limiting membrane of proinsulin-positive IGs. additional CD-MPR label in the TGN area was found over CCVs and over small electron-dense MPR transport vesicles. mature granules have the classically described appearance of an electron lucent halo between their content and limiting membrane. additional CD-MPR staining is found over clathrin-coated TGN vesicles (large arrowheads) and small transport vesicles (small arrowheads) a semiquantitative analysis of the CD-MPR and AP-1 distributions revealed that the percentage of immunolabeling for these antigens declined approximately threefold from IGs to mature granules. in these cells, 90% of the CD-MPRs in IGs are removed during granule maturation. a range of secretory granules can be identified along the spectrum of maturity, based on the electron density of their luminal contents. we found both CI-MPR and AP-1 labeling associated with secretory granules with less condensed contents that were found close to the Golgi complex (i.e., IGs) labeling of CI-MPR and AP-1 localized predominantly to clathrin-coated membranes. AP-1 label is associated with vesicles budding from TGN tubules. AP-1 label is present in IGs (i) with less electron-dense contents. semiquantitative analysis of the subcellular distribution of CD-MPR revealed that 18% of total CD-MPR label was associated with IGs and only 9% with mature granules. AP-1 showed a comparable decrease in labeling density between IGs and mature granules. immunolabeling revealed a high number of gold particles representing cathepsin B in granules with a less dense content. occasional cathepsin B immunoreactivity was detected in clathrin-coated evaginations that appeared budding from forming granules. the mature, 31-kD lysosomal form of cathepsin B clearly predominated in the steady state. after synthesis, intracellular conversion of newly synthesized ProB to mature B was also apparent. even up to 2 h of chase, a predominant fraction of the new enzyme was still in the precursor form. morphological and biochemical data in Figs. 5 and 6 suggest that ProB enters IGs in the rat parotid, but that intragranular concentrations of the hydrolase eventually decline. the lysosomal form of cathepsin B appears gradually after a delay, ultimately achieving accumulation of mature B. the small amount of a 35-kD band directly beneath ProB does not represent mature B. the small stimulated release of a 30-kD band directly beneath ProB most likely represents proteolysis of ProB in the medium sample rather than mature cathepsin B. intracellular cathepsin B was the mature, 31-kD lysosomal form. at chase times >3 h, ongoing conversion was detected. however, in pulse-chase experiments up to 3 h, no newly synthesized ProB had yet reached lysosomes, based on conversion to the mature form. syntaxin 6 labeling was found over IG membranes, whereas mature granules were nearly devoid of label. nearly one-third of all syntaxin 6 label was found in membranes exhibiting a morphologically apparent clathrin coat. nearly one-third of the label was buds emerging from IGs. the degree of syntaxin 6/AP-1 colocalization in the coated membranes of the TGN (53%) was similar to that observed in IGs. in rat parotid cells, 15% of total syntaxin 6 label was found over membranes with a morphologically apparent clathrin coat. immunogold labeling, 41% of the coated, syntaxin 6\u2013positive IG-associated buds and 40% of the coated, syntaxin 6\u2013positive TGN membranes, were also positive for AP-1. further semiquantitative analysis showed that 12% of total syntaxin 6 label was associated with IGs, and only 3% with mature granules."}
