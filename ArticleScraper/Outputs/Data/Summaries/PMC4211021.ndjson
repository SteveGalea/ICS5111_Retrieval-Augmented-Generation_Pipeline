{"summary": "a new type of avian influenza, H7N9, emerged in china in early 2013. it quickly became an issue of great public concern and widely discussed topic on the internet. a considerable volume of relevant information was made publicly available on the internet through various sources. internet-based investigation has a great potential to become a quick, economical, novel approach to investigating sudden issues of great public concern. the internet has removed a major constraint to accessing and sharing data, information, and knowledge. the internet also provides novel opportunities for health research. based research in the health sciences include Infovigil, HealthMap, MedISys, BioCaster, and EpiSPIDER. internet-based methods involve considerably fewer resources, including money, time, and human resources. in early 2013, a new type of avian influenza, H7N9, emerged in china, becoming a matter of strong public concern. suspected and confirmed cases of H7N9 virus infection were defined according to the definition of H5N1 cases recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2006. if laboratory tests indicated the presence of the virus, the case was considered confirmed. governmental data was considered most trustworthy and contributed most of the data in this study. we included 2 cases reported on health authority websites in Hong Kong, but did not search Taiwan-based websites. no case was reported in Macau. data included demographic data, such as age, sex, rural/urban residency, and occupation; epidemiological data, such as potential exposure history to the H7N9 virus, the number of close contacts, secondary cases, familial aggregation cases, and confirming method for diagnosis. Statistical Analysis We used descriptive and analytic statistics to summarize the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of confirmed H7N9 cases. information on each confirmed case was collected through field investigation until December 1, 2013. confirmed H7N9 cases were those that claimed to be newly identified H7N9 cases reported on either government or nongovernment websites. the data in this study were obtained from only 2 website categories: government and major media websites. data was included in daily reports published on relevant government authority websites. websites were selected according to usefulness, accessibility, and credibility. cases were identified based on the date of illness onset, family name, demographic data, and exposure history. the median age was 58 years, with 33.9% (111/327) older than 65 years and 1.8% (6/327) younger than 5 years. more men (219/327, 67.0%) than women were reported as confirmed cases. 91 cases were confirmed using nucleic acid detection. the remaining 20 cases were confirmed by a group of infectious disease specialists. n/N (%) 3/3 (100.0) 79/108 (73.1) 5/5 (100.0) Exposure to a symptomatic case within 2 weeks before illness onset. 3/12 (25.0) 24/107 (22.4) 4/39 (10.3) Pigeons 1/12 (8.3) 13/107 (12.1) 1/39 (2.7) Quails 1/12 (8.3) 2/107 (1.9) 1/39 (2.7) Direct contact with poultry 9/12 (75.0) 63/107 (58.9) 17/39 (43.6) Nucleic acid detection confirming, n/N (%) 58/78 (74.4) 89/139 (64.0) 71/91 (78.0 209 cases were hospitalized, 33 (33/61, 54.1%) were admitted to ICUs, and 16 (16/23, 69.7%) developed ARDS. median time from illness onset to hospitalization was 4.0 days, 5.0 days (55 cases), and 6.5 days (6 cases), 6.0 days (3 cases), and 16.5 days (34 cases), respectively. cases 41 137 55 Median (IQR) 5.0 (3.0-6.5) 4.0 (3.0-6.0) 5.0 (3.0-6.0) Time from onset to hospitalization-days Number of cases 4 103 6 Median (IQR) 7.5 (5.5-10.3) 7.0 (5.0-9.0) 6.5 (4.8-8.8) Time from onset to development of ARDS-days Number of cases 3 83 3 Median (IQR) 6.0 (NE)e 7.0 (5.0 859 occurred in Jiangsu, 310 in Shanghai, 113 in Zhejiang, 72 in Anhui, 45 in Henan, 42 in Fujian, 54 in Jiangxi, 9 in Shandong, 37 in Beijing, and 210 in Guangdong. only 11 of these people developed respiratory symptoms during the 7-day surveillance period. we were unable to collect detailed information on the identified family clusters (Tables 1 and 2). Based on the Internet data by December 1, 2013, the epidemic curve shown in Figure 2 is very similar to that in Li\u2019s report. only 102 cases had the information on the date of onset of illness. 65

number of patients having data on that characteristic, and the corresponding percentage. only 33 deaths were found, with a case fatality rate of 23.9%. despite the problem of missing data, we obtained a case fatality (71/327, 21.7%) lower than that reported in Li\u2019s study (47/139, 33.8%). if using individual data from the Internet with the same cutoff date of December 1, 2013, the case fatality was 23.9% (33/138), which was still lower than 33.8% (47/139) reported in our study. the plateau stages in 2013 and 2014 were from March 31 to April 28, 2013 and from January 10 to February 10, 2014. cases in 2014 were younger and more likely to live in rural areas than those in 2013. the fatality rate in 2014 was lower than that in 2013 and the sex ratio was similar in the 2 years. data in the table provided are the number of patients with a certain characteristics, the total number of patients having data on that characteristic, and the corresponding percentage. we updated the outbreak up to February 10, 2014, and found a total of 334 confirmed cases distributed in 15 regions in China. internet-based data sources can provide useful information on basic epidemiological characteristics of an outbreak like H7N9. the features and progress of an outbreak can be studied in a timely manner and reported by those who have special analytical skills. such research can assist the general population and health workers in acquiring a timely overview of an epidemic. the internet could be used for investigating epidemiological and clinical characteristics of such infectious disease outbreaks as the H7N9 outbreak. the results of this study indicate that the Internet could be used for investigating epidemiological and clinical characteristics of such infectious disease outbreaks. incomplete data can be easily complemented, counterchecked, and corrected. if an epidemic persists, in particular when it involves only a few sporadic cases, data on newly confirmed cases could be collected through the Internet for analysis and updating. incomplete data can be overcome by using aggregate data that are normally more conveniently available on the Internet. between December 1, 2013 and February 10, 2014, 196 cases were identified for the second outbreak but the date of illness onset was available only for 30 patients. this prevented us from describing reliably the epidemic curve for the second outbreak. the results of the study agreed in most epidemiological and clinical characteristics with those from an authoritative conventional epidemiologic study [17] the findings of our study are consistent in most of the epidemiological characteristics examined but show some discrepancies primarily in clinical characteristics of patients. the discrepancies were observed in the percentage of patients hospitalized, admitted to ICUs and diagnosed with ARDS. internet-based data indicated that the case fatality rate of H7N9-infected patients (21.7%) was considerably lower than that of H5N1-infected patients in both China (70%) and worldwide (59%) [20,21], but higher than that (10%) of patients with (SARS) [22]. a subgroup analysis suggested that the case fatality rate before the first H7N9 case was substantially higher than that after that. it could be partially explained by the incomplete reporting of patients with mild early initial Internet data and their analyses may greatly help alert and pressure governments to facilitate timely publication of all the data to the general public. if an epidemic persists, in particular when it involves only a few sporadic cases, data on newly confirmed cases could be collected through the Internet for analysis and updating. if an epidemic persists, in particular when it involves only a few sporadic cases, data on newly confirmed cases could be collected through the Internet for analysis and updating. as of march 1, 2014, there were 375 confirmed cases of H7N9 and 80 people had died resulting in a case fatality rate of 21.3%. incomplete data are more likely to occur on details of individual cases than the cases themselves."}
