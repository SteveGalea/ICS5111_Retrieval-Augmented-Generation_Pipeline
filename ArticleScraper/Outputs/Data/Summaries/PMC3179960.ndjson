{"summary": "Chikungunya Virus (ChikV) triggered an autophagic process in HEK.293 infected cells. the autophagic process was recently observed to be hijacked by virus for their own replication. the relationship between autophagy and viral replication will greatly improve our knowledge of the pathogenesis of ChikV. the virus is an Alphavirus of the Togaviridae family transmitted to humans through arthropods bites (mosquitoes of the genus) autophagy was identified in yeast by genetic screening with the discovery of 30 AuTophaGy-related genes. most of these genes have now been identified in other organisms as orthologs, suggesting that autophagy is a highly conserved mechanism in eukaryotes. formation of the autophagosome requires two ubiquitin-like systems. phagy-induced in adenovirus infection promotes viral infection and oncolysis. this study provides the first evidence that cellular autophagy is promoted in ChikV-infected cells. samples were added two hours before infection with ChikV (MOI = 1). primers were used: Hu GAPDH_F, 5'-GAACGGGAAGCTTGTCATCA-3, and Hu GAPDH_R. cell immunofluorescence staining Adherent cells were grown and infected on glass coverslips. they were incubated in primary antibodies (1/200) in PBS-BSA 1% and then with secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa594 (1/1000) nucleus morphology was revealed by DAPI staining. RNA Interference Cells were transfected with an annealed beclin-1 siRNA. an aspecific (unrelated) siRNA was used as a negative control. the silencing efficiency was assessed by Western Blot analyses of whole cell extract. transfected cells were initially selected with 400 g/ml of G418. one step qRT-PCR was used to amplify the E1 gene. samples were analyzed at 24 h and 48 h post-infection. monoclonal mouse anti-ChikV antibodies (clones 6C and 4F), a kind gift from Biomerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France, and IMTSSA (Armed Forces Institute of Tropical Medicine, Pharo), were used to detect ChikV. about 50 g of each sample was loaded onto a 4-12% precasted NuPAGE gels. membranes were incubated with primary antibodies and followed by horseradish peroxydase-conjugated secondary antibody. the immune complexes were revealed by ECL (PerkinElmer) HEK.293 cells are susceptible to ChikV and efficiently replicate the virus. HEK.293 cells cultured on glass coverslips were incubated from 8 h to 48 h with a MOI = 1 of the ChikV. dilution of an E1 plasmid was used as a standard. hekungunya virus induces autophagy in HEK.293 cells. LC3 is conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine, which participates in the formation of autophagosomes. the status of cells regarding infection was determined by detection of ChikV antigens using a monoclonal antibody directed against the E1 glycoprotein and Alexa Fluor 594 (red)-conjugated secondary reagent. for each positive cell, the number of GFP-LC3 dots was counted. a proportion of virions were observed within the lumen of double-membrane-vesicles. the colocalisation of viral particles in these structures suggests they may interfere with the viral life cycle. Western Blot analysis showed a limited expression of viral envelope and capsid proteins in infected cells pre-incubated with 3-MA. this finding suggests that autophagic machinery may not have an antiviral role during ChikV infection. cells were transfected with siRNA to knock down beclin-1 gene expression. autophagy is required for effective ChikV replication. induction of autophagy enhances viral growth. cultures analyzed in (B) were subjected to qRT-PCR quantification of viral RNA present in cell culture supernatant. expression levels of ChikV structural proteins in HEK.293 infected cells maintained in the presence of medium alone (Ct) or supplemented with Rapamycin (Rapa) HEK.293 cells cultured on glass coverslips were incubated from 8 h to 48 h with a MOI = 1 of the ChikV or mock infected. the percentage of ChikV-infected cells was quantified during the time course of infection. stable cell line expresses the fusion protein of green fluorescent protein (GFP) and LC3. in uninfected cells (Ct), GFP-LC3 showed a diffuse localization throughout the cytoplasm. results indicate that ChikV infection generates a redistribution of LC3 and stimulates autophagy. chikV infection stimulates autophagosome formation in HEK.293 cells. the cells were challenged with a high infectious dose of ChikV (MOI = 5) to increase the number of infected cells in the culture and favor the visualization of ChikV-positive cells. this observation confirms that ChikV infection stimulates autophagosome formation in HEK.293 cells. 3-MA is a selective inhibitor of autophagy which blocks the formation of autophagosomes and inhibits intracellular protein degradation without affecting protein synthesis. pre-treatment with 3-MA 2 hours before the infection with ChikV (MOI = 1) resulted in a significant reduction in the number of ChikV infected cells. ral RNA level was determined from cell supernatant. hek.293 cells were infected with a MOI = 1 after transfection with beclin-1. expression of beclin-1 was monitored by immunoblotting using a specific mAb. kV viral RNA detected in cell culture supernatant were also increased. expression of E1 and E2 envelope glycoproteins and capsid protein is enhanced in cells exposed to the drug before viral challenge. this suggests that autophagic process enhances viral replication and that it is critical for an intracellular step of the virus life cycle. pathogens have been shown to be targeted for autophagic degradation. autophagy may have a protective role by limiting virus replication. it has been shown for tobacco mosaic virus, Sindbis virus and parvovirus B19. the early induction of autophagy, within 2 hours post infection, is in favour of the first hypothesis. but we can not exclude that ChikV could also have a role in the late phases of autophagosomes maturation. autophagic process on ChikV replication suggests autophagy is a promoting factor. apoptosis may lead to the persistence of the virus in macrophages. this work was funded by the program 'pathoviro' of CRVOI (Centre de recherche et de Veille dans l'Oc\u00e9an Indien)."}
