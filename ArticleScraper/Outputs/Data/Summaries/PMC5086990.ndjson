{"summary": "we engineered site-specific S1/S2 mutations (RSVR751/S in Fig. 1B) the WT S1/S2-encoding region was replaced with the codons (YSAS751/S) from a MERS-CoV\u2013related bat CoV-HKU4 (Hong Kong University 4). WT and mutant MERS-CoVs produced comparable amounts of progeny viruses in vero81 and Huh7 cells. mutant virus titers were nearly 3 log10 less virus than those of the WT. average progeny virus yields from HAE were 104.4 for WT and mutant SSVR viruses. proteins were evaluated by detecting C-terminal epitopes on western blots. mutants were specifically compromised for transduction into lung-derived Calu3 cells (Fig. 2A) and HAE cells (Fig. 2B) trypsin processed the uncleaved fraction of WT S proteins into fragments at 95 kDa. ySAS S proteins were cleaved at an alternative more N-terminal cleavage site. ySAS pp transductions were not affected by trypsin. MERS-CoV depends on S1/S2 cleavage by proprotein convertases within 293T producer cells to efficiently infect lung-derived Calu3 target cells. preliminary Cleavage increases SARS S-Mediated Virus-Cell Entry. luciferase levels in kilodaltons were measured at 48-h posttransduction. error bars present SD from the mean (n = 4) S1/S2 cleavage facilitates the receptor-induced exposure of a second S2\u2032 cleavage site. the mixed pps were treated with increasing concentrations of trypsin. similar experiments were carried out in parallel with YSAS pps. proteases cleaving S proteins early after virus binding to target cells include serine-class transmembrane proteins (TMPRs) and furin/proprotein convertases (24, 37, 38), whereas those cleaving S proteins later, after virus endocytosis, include cysteine-class cathepsins (26). early and late coV-cell entry can be distinguished by their sensitivities to serine- and cysteine-specific protease virus entry was quantified by measuring luciferase levels in infected cells at 48-h (A, C) or 18-h (B) posttransduction. Error bars present SD from the mean (n = 3). TTSP family TMPR serine 2 (TMPRSS2) in Huh7 cells. overexpressed TMPRSS2 overexpression made all MERS pp transductions slightly sensitive to camostat. overexpressed TMPRSS2 overexpression made all MERS pp transductions completely resistant to E64d. Caco2 cells were incubated with protease inhibitors (100 M camostat, 50 M PCI, 10 M E64d) or with pp-lacking S proteins (Bald). cells were then transduced with WT or S1/S2 mutant (YSAS or SSVR) MERS pps. late-acting proteases in Calu3 cells accounted for virus resistance. transduced cells were highly sensitized to uncleaved MERS pp entry. similar augmentation of uncleaved MERS transduction was achieved by exposing cell-bound MERS pps to purified human cathepsin L. we engineered site-specific S1/S2 mutations (RSVR751/S) to evaluate the consequences of S proteolytic cleavage on virus infection. the WT S1/S2 region was replaced with the codons (YSAS751/S) from a MERS-CoV\u2013related bat CoV-HKU4. mutants produced 4 log10 less viral mRNA than WT. mutants produced comparable amounts of progeny viruses in Vero81 and Huh7 cells. in Calu3 cells, mutant virus titers were nearly 3 log10 less virus than the WT. pps express firefly luciferase (Fluc), with Fluc levels providing quantitative measurements of virus-cell entry. the pps were pelleted, and particle-associated S proteins were evaluated by detecting C-terminal epitopes on western blots. MERS pps were prepared in serum-free 293T media (SFM) and incubated with trypsin before transduction. trypsin processed the uncleaved fraction of WT S proteins into fragments at 95 kDa. ySAS S proteins were cleaved at an alternative more N-terminal cleavage site. these pps were concentrated, and pp-associated S proteins were evaluated. those secreted from PCI-treated cells contained primarily uncleaved S proteins and were compromised for Calu3 transduction. preliminary Cleavage increases SARS S-Mediated Virus-Cell Entry. kilodaltons were incubated with trypsin pretreated pps. luciferase levels were measured at 48-h posttransduction. we hypothesized that the MERS-CoV S proteins respond to receptor binding by changing conformation. trypsin uniquely generated a stable 72-kDa fragment (Fig. 4A) however, in the presence of DPP4, trypsin uniquely generated a stable 72-kDa fragment (Fig. 4A) these findings suggest specific biologically meaningful cleavage sites are exposed in response to receptor binding. proteases cleaving S proteins early after virus binding to target cells include serine-class transmembrane proteins (TMPRs) and furin/proprotein convertases (24, 37, 38), whereas those cleaving S proteins later, after virus endocytosis, include cysteine-class cathepsins (26). early and late coV-cell entry can be distinguished by their sensitivities to serine- and cysteine-specific protease MERS pp transductions into Caco2 and Vero81 cells were also sensitive to inhibitors of later-acting proteases. three HAE cultures were incubated with indicated protease inhibitors. three HAE cultures were incubated with indicated protease inhibitors. mERS or VSV pps were differentially sensitive to protease inhibitors. we overexpressed the TTSP family TMPR serine 2 (TMPRSS2) in Huh7 cells. overexpressed TMPRSS2 overexpression increased Fluc accumulation. uncleaved MERS viruses require late proteases and do not infect Calu3 cells. we inferred that Calu3 cells are deplete in endosomal cathepsins. the inference was validated by measuring protease-encoding transcripts by quantitative RT-PCR. TMPRSS2, furin, cathepsin L, cathepsin B and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) mRNA levels were measured in Huh7 cell extracts. cells were transduced with lentiviral vectors encoding human cathepsin L or GFP. a proteolytic cascade can be viewed in the context of a proteolytic cascade that includes at least two cleavages in S proteins, first at S1/S2 then at S2\u2032. for some variant forms of MERS-CoV, the cascade begins when viruses bind target cells, and then ends when a sufficient number of adjacent S proteins are triggered for fusion activation. uncleaved viruses bypassed early proteases and required late proteases. uncleaved mutants were able to infect the more cathepsin protease-enriched Huh7 and Vero81 cells. SSVR mutants are cleaved by extracellular proteases, making their infection resemble that of WT viruses at the point of entry into some HAE cells. the precleaved viruses are presumably processed to fusion-ready S2\u2032 products by early cell-surface serine proteases. the recent 4A resolution structures of murine CoV (MHV) and human CoV (HKU-1) S proteins depict uncleaved ectodomain trimers, without ligation to receptors (16, 17) the current structures do suggest that receptor binding locks relatively dynamic S proteins into conformations that expose cleavage sites to host proteases. the affinity of SARS-CoV S with its receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is 10- to 20-fold higher than that of MERS-CoV S with its receptor DPP4 (47, 48). this finding contrasts with the SARS-CoV epidemics of 2003\u20132004, where adaptive changes increased binding affinities to ACE2 (50). preliminary S1/S2 proteolysis gives infecting viruses the facility to use TMPRSS2 and other early-acting proteases. preliminary S cleavages may also contribute to the tissue tropism and pathogenesis of feline and murine coVs. MERS pps and DPP4 pps were incubated in 1:5 M ratios, digested with graded doses of trypsin, and S fragments visualized by Western blotting.
