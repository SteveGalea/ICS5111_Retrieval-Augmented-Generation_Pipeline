{"summary": "SARS-CoV is an emerging infectious pathogen of zoonotic origin. no new cases of SARS have been reported since 2004. the development of effective vaccines is highly desirable for the prevention and containment of future outbreaks of SARS. the foldon domain was identified in the bacteriophage T4 fibritin protein (8). we compared the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of monomeric full-length spike ectodomain (S) and monomeric S1 domain with trimerized forms of S and S1 generated by fusion of the foldon domain to the carboxy termini of the proteins. HHHHHH (the underlined amino acid residues are the foldon peptide) was synthesized with a Hind III and a Not I restriction site at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends. DNA fragments encoding a.a. 14\u2013667 (S1 domain) or a.a. 668\u20131192 (S2 domain) were amplified by PCR from a vector containing the full-length S gene that was codon-optimized for expression phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) subjected to chromatography purification with Ni-NTA columns. proteins eluted with linear gradient of imidazole in PBS were dialyzed against PBS. protein concentration was determined by using a Dc Protein Assay (BioRad) with bovine gamma globulin as the standard. 100 L of protein in PBS was mixed with 7.7 L of alum gel plus 5 L of MPL on a rotator overnight at 4\u00b0C. animals in the control groups received PBS with the same adjuvants on the same days. serum was treated at 56\u00b0C for 30 min to inactivate complement and then diluted 1:4 with DMEM. serial 1:2 dilutions of the serum were then made in a 96-well tissue culture plate by adding 125 L of the 4-fold diluted serum to an equal volume of DMEM. each serum was tested in four replicates for each dilution. the whole lung tissue from each mouse was homogenized manually in a sterile microcentrifuge tube with a plastic pestle. the homogenate was centrifuged in a benchtop centrifuge at top speed for 3 min. the supernatant was stored in aliquots at 20\u00b0C until use. DNA fragments encoding a.a. 14\u2013667 (S1 domain) or a.a. 668\u20131192 (S2 domain) were amplified by PCR from a vector containing the full-length S gene that was codon-optimized for expression in mammalian cells. pAcGP-S or pAcGP-S-foldon, generating plasmids pAcGP-S1, pAcGP- supernatants of the cultures of high Five insect cells infected with the recombinant viruses were harvested, concentrated 10-fold, and buffer-exchanged to phosphate-buffered saline. protein concentration was determined by using a Dc Protein Assay (BioRad) with bovine gamma globulin as the standard. mice 6\u20138 weeks old (n=5\u20138 per group) were immunized subcutaneously (s.c.) or intramuscularly (i.m.) with 20 g each of the purified recombinant proteins formulated with TiterMax. one volume of protein in PBS was emulsified with one volume of the adjuvant. each dose was delivered in 100 L. en 20 (PBS-T), 100 L of peroxidase-conjugated goat anti\u2013mouse IgG (Sothern Biotech) diluted 1:4,000 in PBS-T was added to detect bound antibody. peroxidase substrate solution (KPL) containing 2,2\u2032-azino-di-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonate and hydrogen peroxide was used to develop the plates. mice were euthanized on day 3 following challenge and lungs were harvested and stored at 80\u00b0C. determination of viral titers was determined on vero E6 cell monolayers. the other 5 proteins were purified to near homogeneity as determined by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B). the other 5 proteins were purified to near homogeneity as determined by SDS-PAGE. the immunogenicity of the recombinant proteins was first tested in groups of BALB/c mice (n=5) administered individual proteins by the subcutaneous route with TiterMax Gold Adjuvant. ten days after the third dose, sera were obtained at the time of euthanasia of the mice. serum ELISA antibody titers and virus neutralization titers were determined on plates coated with cognate antigens (A) mice were immunized three times subcutaneously (n=5) or intramuscularly (n=8) with recombinant proteins formulated with Alum/MPL and ELISA titers in sera were determined against cognate antigens. group of 6 mice were immunized i.m. with S1, S1-foldon, S, S-foldon adjuvanted with alum/MPL or PBS plus adjuvant alone as a control on day 0, day 14, and day 42. a fourth dose was given on day 112. The mice were bled on day 133 (3 weeks after the last dose of vaccine) the detection limit is 1.45 log10 TCID50/g of lung tissue. recombinant trimeric full-length S proteins contain a transmembrane domain. the foldon has been shown to promote trimerization of a number of recombinant proteins such as collagen fibers. a major fraction of S-foldon appeared to retain a trimeric state. it is unknown to what extent the trimeric S-foldon is structurally similar to the native spike protein. the foldon was the most potent immunogen among all five recombinant proteins tested in this study. several studies have suggested that S2 domain contains neutralizing epitopes. recombinant S2 domain was highly immunogenic but could not induce neutralizing antibodies. recombinant S2 domain of other coronaviruses also failed to induce neutralizing antibodies (20,21) Author Disclosure Statement No competing financial interests exist."}
