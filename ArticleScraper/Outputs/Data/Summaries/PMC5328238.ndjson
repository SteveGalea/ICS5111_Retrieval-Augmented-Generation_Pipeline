{"summary": "the only tuberculosis vaccine currently available is an attenuated strain of mycobacterium bovis BCG (BCG), although its efficacy against adult TB disease remains controversial. 500,000 of people around the world are affected by MDR-TB every year, but there are a small number of effective drugs against MDR-TB. cynomolgus monkey model is an excellent model of human tuberculosis. in the previous study, we evaluated the therapeutic and protective efficacy of HSP65 DNA + IL-12 DNA vaccine. the vaccine contains two kinds of DNA in one plasmid vector (pVAX1). spleen cells obtained were cultured in vitro by the stimulation with recombinant HSP 65 antigen, PPD, or killed H37Ra TB antigens for 1 day or two days. injection of 100 g of the vaccine/mouse i.m. three times in two weeks induced significantly (p0.01) high production of IL-2 by the stimulation with HSP65, PPD. 25 g of DNA vaccine/mouse i.m. did not exert the enhancement of IL-2 production significantly in comparison to control group. the production of IL-2 by the vaccination using 200 g DNA was same level of IL-2 production by the vaccination using 100 g DNA. thrice vaccination in two weeks also augmented strong IFN- production. 100 g pDNA (HSP65 DNA + IL-12 DNA) + 1AU HVJ-E were used as vaccine. after 4 weeks, spleen cells were cultured in vitro by the stimulation with 10g/ml of recombinant HSP65 antigen (derived from H37Rv TB) and 20g/ml of killed H37Ra TB antigen for 1 day. 25 g, 100g or 200g DNA vaccine/mouse was i.m. administrated into C57BL/6 mice in two weeks. 25g pDNA (HSP65 DNA+IL-12 DNA)+HVJ-E 0.25AU/mouse, 100g pDNA+HVJ-E 0.25AU/mouse, 200g pDNA+HVJ-E 2.0AU/mouse. control (5% trehalose phosphate buffer ratio of pDNA to HVJ-E was investigated for the induction of the cytokine (IL-2) the ratio of 100 g pDNA to 0.22AU was administrated into C57BL/6 mice. IL-2 production by the stimulation with 10 g/ml of HSP65 protein or 20 g/ml PPD antigen was analyzed by ELISA. three weeks after challenge, therapeutic efficacy was measured by enumerating the bacterial loads in the liver. results are expressed as the mean log10 S.D. of CFU. the statistical significance of differences between vaccinated group () and control group () was determined by student's test (n = 10) the vaccine will be repeatedly i.m. administered into cynomolgus monkeys. repeated-dose toxicity test of GLP-level is planned. pharmacology study of preclinical study using monkey is planned to investigate for clinical trial. pVAX-HSP65 DNA/human IL-12 DNA+HVJ-E. vaccine which contains these two kinds of DNA in one plasmid vector (pVAX) demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy against TB in the monkey model. HSP65 DNA+IL-12 DNA vaccine exerted strong therapeutic efficacy (100% survival at 19weeks after challenge and increase of immune responses) y pharmacology, toxicokinetic study and toxicology test should provide a significant rationale for moving this vaccine into clinical trial. plan for clinical trial of HVJ-E/HSP65 DNA+IL-12 DNA therapeutic vaccine for the patients with MDR-TB is shown in Table 4. mice were kept in isolator cages and manipulated in laminar flow hoods. all vaccinations, TB administration and experiments on isolate tissue of animal were done under anesthetic state. intramuscular (i.m.) administration route was compared with intradermal (i.d.) administration using IL-2, IFN- and IL-6 production activity of spleen cells. administration doses of the vaccine 25g, 100g, or 200g of pDNA (pVAX1-HSP65 DNA + IL-12 DNA) were analyzed using ELISA. mouse cytokines were measured in quantitative ELISAs for IL-2, IFN-, and IL-6 as described previously. therapeutic efficacy of pVAX1-HSP65 DNA+IL-12 DNA vaccine on the TB infection in the C57BL/6 mice. the pDNA was made in Oriental Yeast (Shiga, Japan) five % of trehalose phosphate buffer was used as control. the hemagglutinating virus of Japan (HVJ)-envelope was purchased from Ishihara (Osaka, Japan) and used as previously described. administration doses of the vaccine 25g, 100g, or 200g of pDNA were immunized i.m. into C57BL/6 mice 3 times in two weeks. after 4 weeks spleen cells were stimulated with 10g/ml of HSP65 protein, 20g/ml of PPD or 20g/ml of killed H37Ra TB antigen for 1 day. authors thank Dr. Y.
