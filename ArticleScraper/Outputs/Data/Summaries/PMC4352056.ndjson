{"summary": "EV71 is a small (33\u201335nm), single-stranded, positive-sense, non-enveloped RNA virus with a viral genome of approximately 7.5kb. it is a small (33\u201335nm), single-stranded, positive-sense, non-enveloped RNA virus with a viral genome of approximately 7.5kb. there are no clinically approved vaccines or antiviral drugs available against EV71 to date the viral genome is translated into the viral polyprotein. the 3D protein participates in the transcription of the positive-sense genomic viral RNA into the complementary negative-sense viral RNA. the genomic RNA is then translated into more viral polyproteins in a cap-independent manner. the polyproteins are then processed into structural capsid proteins and non-structural proteins. an immunofluorescence cell-based virus infection assay was set-up to screen the human serine/threonine kinase siRNA library using a set of validated small interfering RNAs targeting the host serine/threonine kinases. MINK, also known as MAP4K6, is a germinal center kinase from the Ste20 family of kinases that includes more than 30 serine/threonine kina MINK activates the JNK and p38 MAPK pathway, which are important signalling pathways involved in various cellular functions. p38 MAPK pathway has also been reported to play a role in the IRES-mediated viral protein translation of Encephalomyocarditis virus viral RNA. MINK and MAP4K2 were identified as putative targets crucial to EV71 replication. the top three targets identified, PAK1, MINK and MAP4K2, were first analysed. RNAs at 45nM in infectious virus released from the cells as indicated by viral plaque assays. the siRNA targeting cyclophilin B was included in the secondary assay to ensure that the effect of infectious virus titre reduction was not due to off-target effects. minimal cellular cytotoxicity was observed across the concentrations of both MINK and MAP4K2 siRNAs. western blot analysis was performed to detect protein expression levels of MINK, with -actin as the loading control. MINK protein expression was observed to decrease in a dose-dependent manner across siRNA concentration. MINK was selected for further investigation. western blotting was carried out to verify the gene knockdown efficiency. MINK was selected for further investigation. MINK is essential for the replication of other human enteroviruses. MINK siRNA-treated cells were infected with various human enteroviruses. the knockdown of MINK resulted in the reduction of infectious virus titre by approximately 2.3 log units. MINK plays an essential role in EV71 viral protein synthesis. EV71 RNA was transfected into RD cells pre-treated with MINK siRNA. supernatant was harvested from cells at 12h post-infection. band intensities representing VP0 and VP2 protein expression level were quantitated with reference to actin control bands (for each time-point) and 0nM using ImageJ Gel Analysis program. MINK plays an essential role in EV71 viral protein synthesis and viral RNA synthesis. a background control measuring the viral RNA levels at 0h post-infection was included to account for the background viral RNA resulted from virus entry and the binding of residual virions on the cell surfaces. the infected cells pre-treated with the siRNA were harvested at 8h and 10h post-infection to examine the relative amount of viral RNA. greatest increase in the EV71 structural viral protein expression, VP0 (36kDa) and VP2 (28kDa), was observed between 4 and 8h post-infection. at 8h post-infection, a dose-dependent reduction in the VP0 and VP2 was observed in EV71-infected cells pre-treated with MINK siRNA. the reduction in the amount of virus released was not due to a blockage in the virus release process upon the silencing of MINK, but was due to a decrease in the total production of virus particles. we hypothesized that the early events in EV71 infection could be responsible for the activation of MINK. phosphorylated (upper bands) and unphosphorylated MINK (lower bands) -actin was used as a loading control. phospho-MINK levels in RNA-transfected cells were comparable to infection control at the same time-points. a corresponding control IgG antibody that does not bind specifically to any proteins was used as a negative control. pre-treatment of RD cells with the anti-SCARB2 antibody blocked EV71 infection in a dose-dependent manner as the virus titre was significantly reduced by 1.5 log at the highest concentration of anti-SCARB2 antibody used. MINK activates the p38 MAPK pathway [23], a signalling pathway that has also been shown to play a role in the replication of EMCV. fecal calf serum (FCS) was removed from the virus stock and growth media to reduce the additional activation of p38 MAPK by the serum. p38 MAPK levels at 0h post-infection appear higher in Fig. 5A. phospho-p38 MAPK levels were significantly increased upon EV71 infection. p38 MAPK phosphorylation downstream of MINK was detected. the band intensities representing phospho-p38 MAPK level were quantitated with reference to actin control bands (for each time-point) and 0hpi using ImageJ Gel Analysis program. the right panel shows the phospho-p38 levels in EV71-infected cells under the same treatments. bled siRNA control (25nM and 45nM) did not affect p38 MAPK phosphorylation levels. p38 MAPK signalling pathway is essential for EV71 replication. p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 [30] was examined for its impact on EV71 replication. cell viability of SB203580-treated cells and untreated control cells were measured using alamarBlue assay at 12h post-treatment. values obtained were normalised against DMSO control. Virus titres in supernatant of cells treated with varying concentrations of SB203580 post-adsorption were analysed via viral plaque assay. relative quantification of viral RNA level was determined. fold difference of viral RNA for all samples was calculated relative to the RNA level in the DMSO control at 0hpi. Statistical analyses were carried out using one-way ANOVA. the production of progeny virus was assessed via viral plaque assay. a significant dose-dependent reduction in the progeny virus production was observed after treatment with SB203580. cell viability of SB203580-treated cells was assessed to rule out the possibility of reduced viral growth due to cytotoxicity. p38 MAPK signalling pathway inhibits EV71 replication during the early phase after viral entry, between 0h and 8h post-infection. co-treatment of EV71 with SB203580 failed to inhibit viral infection, further confirming the involvement of p38 MAPK signalling pathway in the post-entry stage. the extent of the reduction in 3D protein level upon SB203580 treatment corresponded to the decrease in the viral RNA levels. we were interested to know if p38 MAPK was also involved in the viral release of EV71 using the p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB203580) a bicistronic luciferase reporter construct was transfected into cells. the expression of Renilla luciferase (RLuc) is dependent on the cap-dependent mechanism. the translation efficiency directed by the 5\u2019 UTR of EV71 was determined by comparing the level of FLuc with the level of RLuc. siRNA knockdown of MINK and inhibition of p38 MAPK phosphorylation reduce translation efficiency of EV71 IRES. RD cells were pre-treated with MINK or scrambled siRNA. effect of knockdown of MINK on EV71 IRES activity. transfected cells with the bicistronic construct without drug treatment (DMSO control) were used as positive control. p38 MAPK is involved in the translational regulation of viral transcripts downstream of MINK activation. eIF4E protein expression and phosphorylation levels were observed to decrease upon EV71 infection. we hypothesized that the MINK/p38 MAPK pathway might activate an IRES tran-sacting factor downstream. hnRNP A1 act as an ITAF that relocalises in the cytoplasm where it interacts with the EV71 IRES upon infection, promoting its translation efficiency. MINK silencing and p38 MAPK inhibition in EV71-infected cells inhibits cytoplasmic localisation of hnRNP A1. RD cells were pre-treated with MINK targeting and scrambled siRNA and subjected to infection with EV71. hnRNP A1 in the nucleus increased significantly upon SB203580 treatment at 50M (81.3% colocalisation, Fig. 8B ix-xii) compared to the DMSO control (52.9% colocalisation, Fig. 8B v-viii). the level of hnRNP A1 in the nucleus was even higher in cells treated with 100M of SB203580. cytoplasmic localisation of hnRNP A1 downstream of p38 MAPK signalling was not stimulated by Mnk1 activity. RD cells exposed to UV-inactivated EV71 showed constant phosphorylation level of Mnk1 throughout the 12h time course. to determine if Mnk1 phosphorylation was triggered by the replication of the virus, RD cells were exposed to UV-inactivated EV71. RD cells conducted Western blot analyses with phospho-eIF4E antibody. at 50M, CGP57380 was effective in blocking the kinase activity of Mnk. however, there was no changes in the viral protein levels. inhibition of Mnk1 did not alter the subcellular localisation of hnRNP A1. MINK plays an essential role in EV71 replication. a human serine/threonine kinase siRNA library targets 47 serine/threonine kinases. MINK and MAP4K2 were identified as putative targets. increased concentrations of siRNA resulted in a reduction of immunofluorescence-detectable EV71 replication for cells treated with siRNA against either MINK or MAP4K2. this coincided with the dose-dependent reductions up to 1.5 log for both siRNAs at 45nM. Statistical analyses were performed using one-way ANOVA and Dunnett\u2019s test against untreated control. Western blot analysis was performed to detect protein expression levels of MINK, with -actin as the loading control. es in the supernatant of siRNA-treated cells were analysed via viral plaque assay. Error bars represent standard deviation (SD) of triplicate data. Western blotting was carried out to verify the gene knockdown efficiency. MINK was effective in reducing MINK protein levels at 45nM concentration. all four individual siRNAs resulted in significant reduction in virus titre of 1.3 log at 45nM concentration. MINK is essential for the replication of other human enteroviruses. infectious virus titre obtained from viral plaque assays would assist in the elucidation of the potential involvement of MINK in the viral entry stage. a dose-dependent reduction in the virus yield was observed across the siRNA concentrations. this result suggested that MINK might play a more essential role at the post-entry stage. Statistical analyses were carried out using one-way ANOVA with Dunnett\u2019s test. upper band (36kDa) represents VP0 while lower band (28 kDa) represents VP2. viral RNA synthesis of EV71 was determined by quantitative RT-PCR on viral RNA samples extracted from infected RD cells pre-treated with MINK siRNA (M) or scrambled siRNA (S) control at 25nM (M25 and S25) and 45nM (M45 and S45) the infected cells pre-treated with the siRNA were harvested at 8h and 10h post-infection to examine the relative amount of viral RNA. a time course study was first conducted to identify the time period during which EV71 protein expression occurs. greatest increase in the EV71 structural viral protein expression, VP0 (36kDa) and VP2 (28kDa), was observed between 4 and 8h post-infection. at 8h post-infection, a dose-dependent reduction in the VP0 and VP2 was observed in EV71-infected cells pre-treated with MINK siRNA. 71 virions were quantified at 12h post-infection to determine if MINK plays a role in viral packaging and release. a significant reduction in virus titre was also observed in the intracellular virions. we concluded that the reduction in the amount of virus released was not due to a blockage in the virus release process upon the silencing of MINK. Phos-tag acrylamide binds phosphorylated proteins and retards migration to separate the phosphorylated proteins from their unphosphorylated counterparts. total MINK antibody was used to detect both phosphorylated (upper bands) and unphosphorylated MINK (lower bands) scavenger receptor class B2 (SCARB2) is the cellular receptor for EV71 on RD cells [28]. an antibody to SCARB2 was used to block the cellular SCARB2 receptors to prevent virus binding. entry assays suggested that the phosphorylation of MINK was stimulated post-entry, in the early phase of viral replication. MINK activates the p38 MAPK pathway [23], a signalling pathway that has also been shown to play a role in the replication of Encephalomyelitis virus. cells exposed to UV-inactivated EV71 showed constant phosphorylation level of p38 MAPK throughout the 12h time course. p38 MAPK levels at 0h post-infection appear higher in Fig. 5A in EV71-infected samples than that in the mock-infected samples. p38 MAPK levels were significantly increased upon EV71 infection. levels of p38 MAPK in mock-infected cells were basal and constant across the 12h. cells exposed to UV-inactivated EV71 virus also displayed basal and constant level of p38 MAPK phosphorylation of p38 MAPK. increased concentration of scrambled siRNA control (25nM and 45nM) did not affect p38 MAPK phosphorylation levels. p38 MAPK signalling pathway is essential for EV71 replication in RD cells. 0% DMSO (negative control) and cell lysates were harvested for Western blotting. -actin was included as a loading control. quantification of phospho-p38 MAPK (Thr180/Tyr182) and total p38 protein bands. RT-PCR assay revealed significant reduction in levels of EV71 RNA across increasing SB203580 concentration. total RNA was extracted for all samples at 0, 8 and 10hpi and EV71 RNA levels were measured. CT values were normalised against actin and relative quantification of viral RNA level was determined. RD cells were post-treated with SB203580 and production of progeny virus was assessed via viral plaque assay. a significant dose-dependent reduction in the progeny virus production was observed after treatment with SB203580 with a 1.2-, 2.2- and 3.3 log reduction at 25 M, 75 M and 100 M respectively. pre-treatment of cells with the p38 MAPK inhibitor for 2h prior to EV71 infection showed minimal inhibitory effect against viral infection. at 10h post-infection, the antiviral activity of SB203580 was reduced. this suggested that the blocking of p38 MAPK signalling pathway inhibits EV71 replication during the early phase after viral entry, between 0h and 8h post-infection. the blocking of p38 MAPK pathway also has inhibitory effects on the production of viral RNA. significant reduction in structural protein (VP0 and VP2, Fig. 6F and 6G) and non-structural protein levels were also observed with increasing concentrations of SB203580. MINK/p38 MAPK signalling positively regulates EV71 viral protein translation efficiency. a bicistronic luciferase reporter construct was transfected into cells. the expression of Renilla luciferase (RLuc) is dependent on the cap-dependent mechanism. siRNA knockdown of MINK and inhibition of p38 MAPK phosphorylation reduce translation efficiency of EV71 IRES. RD cells were pre-treated with MINK or scrambled siRNA. three days after transfection, the bicistronic construct was transfected into the cells. effect of p38 MAPK inhibition on EV71 IRES activity. p38 MAPK inhibition reduced hnRNP A1 signals in the cytoplasm upon EV71 infection. a time course study was conducted to examine the activation profile of downstream substrates of p38 MAPK in response to EV71 infection. we did not detect any increase in eIF4E phosphorylation levels upon EV71 infection. instead, eIF4E protein expression and phosphorylation levels were observed to decrease upon EV71 infection. the level of the hnRNP A1 in the nucleus increased significantly upon the siRNA-knockdown of MINK (74.8% colocalisation, Fig. 8A xiii-xvi) compared to the scrambled control (37.2% colocalisation, Fig. 8A ix-xii), resembling the state of hnRNP A1 in mock-infected cells (80.1% colocalisation, Fig RD cells were subjected to infection with EV71 and post-treated with SB203580 (p38 MAPK inhibitor) for 8h. mock-infected and DMSO-treated cells were included as infection and solvent control. hnRNP A1 was one of the targets downstream of MINK/p38 MAPK signalling. relocalisation of hnRNP A1 to the cytoplasm where it binds to the IRES of EV71 RNA is required to facilitate translation initiation of viral RNA. a time course study was first conducted to examine the activation profile of Mnk1. inhibition of Mnk1 did not alter the subcellular localisation of hnRNP A1 (S4H Fig) therefore, it is likely that the cytoplasmic localisation of hnRNP A1 as result of MINK/p38 MAPK signalling was not triggered by Mnk. a novel mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAP4K) has been identified from our primary screen for further investigation. interest in the MAPK family of kinases was sparked by previous studies on the involvement of MAPK family members in viral replication. infected cells have been shown to induce the activation of kinases in early events of viral infection. actin rearrangement induced by the activation of MINK may play a role during the clathrin-mediated entry of EV71. results from the viral entry study via viral RNA transfection were contrary to this hypothesis as silencing of MINK continues to cause inhibition of progeny virus production. a dose-dependent reduction in incomplete processed viral polyproteins levels was observed with the siRNA knockdown of MINK but not in the scrambled control. this narrowed down the potential target event of MINK involvement in the process of viral protein synthesis and not the proteolytic cleavage of the viral polyprotein. p38 MAPK activation on EV71 infection has suggested its essential role in EV71 replication. p38 MAPK signalling pathway promotes viral protein synthesis but not viral RNA synthesis in EMCV. p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580, was effective in inhibiting early events of EV71 replication cycle post-infection and not late events such as virus release. this further supported the relationship between MINK and p38 MAPK signalling. downstream substrate of p38 MAPK can favour viral, cap-independent translation via eIF4E phosphorylation and expression. this suggests that eIF4E phosphorylation and expression may not be crucial for EV71 replication. eIF2 is a 36kDa protein that contains a serine residue (Ser-51). studies on poliovirus have also demonstrated that resistance to eIF2 phosphorylation increases as enteroviral infection progresses due to the cleavage of eIF5B by the viral 3C protease. eIF2 phosphorylation may also serve to promote the viral protein synthesis indirectly by suppressing cellular cap-dependent protein synthesis. hnRNP A1 localises predominantly in the nucleus, but is able to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm in a regulated manner. cytoplasmic accumulation of hnRNP A1 has also been reported to play a role in the positive regulation of human immunodeficiency virus [63] and Sindbis virus (SINV) [20] viral RNA translation. a novel host kinase (MINK) mediates the cap-independent translation of EV71 RNA, possibly by modulating the subcellular localisation of hnRNP A1. this could be due to either lower levels of EV71 replication as a result of MINK silencing or a block in nuclear export signal [64] brought about by the siRNA knockdown of MINK. the inhibition of p38 MAPK with a specific p38 MAPK EV71 infection stimulates MINK activation which triggers a kinase cascade. hnRNP A1 binds to the viral IRES and promotes the recruitment of ribosomes at the IRES at the 5\u2019 untranslated region (UTR) of EV71 genome. the library contains a total of 47 siRNA cocktails with each cocktail consisting of 4 siRNA sequences targeting a specific gene and resuspended at a concentration of 2M in 96-well plates. each cocktail consisting
