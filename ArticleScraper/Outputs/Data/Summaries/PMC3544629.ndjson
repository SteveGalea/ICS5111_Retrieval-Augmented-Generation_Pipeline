{"summary": "the annual number of acute care beds required to treat pediatric LRTIs was estimated. LRTI as primary diagnosis accounted for 32.0 and 75.9% hospitalizations. infants 1 year of age accounted for 47 and 77% hospitalizations. lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in children and infants are common and can require hospitalization; therefore, they are a major public health concern. in children and infants, 50%\u201370% of children will have an RSV infection, and by the third year of age almost all children will have been infected. in northern hemisphere countries, the RSV season usually runs from December through April. this is likely due to the timing of the onset and offset of increased RSV circulation in a community. the burden of disease associated with LRTIs may be reduced by effective public health prevention strategies. population estimates in British Columbia for 2008\u20132010 and projections to 2020 and 2030 were used to model the projected demand for pediatric LRTI hospitalizations up to 2020 and 2030. quantitative estimates of the effects of non-pharmacological interventions to decrease the incidence of LRTIs were generated to assess how the impact of effective public health prevention strategies relate to decreased demand. an ethics approval exemption was granted on the basis of the study using unidentifiable non-clinical/administrative data at an aggregate level. monia due to other specified infectious organisms J17.0 Pneumonia in diseases classified elsewhere J18.0 Bronchopneumonia, unspecified organism J18.1 Lobar pneumonia, unspecified organism J18.8 Other pneumonia, unspecified organism J20.0 Acute bronchitis due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae J20.1 Acute bronchitis due to streptococcus J20.3 Acute bronchitis due to coxsackie virus J LOS was described for all pediatric patients, infants 1 year of age at the time of hospital admission. high-risk infants were defined according to the ICD-10 codes for congenital heart disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, congenital lung disease, and preterm birth defined as 37 weeks completed gestation [5,15,16]. atresia of aorta Q25.3 Stenosis of aorta Q25.4 Other congenital malformations of aorta Q25.6 Other congenital malformations of pulmonary artery Q25.7 Other congenital malformations of pulmonary artery Q26 Congenital malformations of great veins (all subcategories) average annual hospitalization rates for LRTI among the pediatric population were calculated. average number of beds was defined as total bed-days divided by the number of days in the period under analysis. average LOS was estimated as total bed-days divided by the number of days in the period under analysis. peak in bed occupancy was defined as the maximum number of beds occupied simultaneously. LOS in hospital for LRTI as primary diagnosis was 3.10 days (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.03\u20133.21; 82% within 5 days); this is equivalent to a yearly average of 19.6 acute beds required to treat pediatric LRTIs. most of the LRTI admissions were for an unspecified viral cause (2932/4588; 63.9%) the average LOS for LRTI as the primary diagnosis was 3.23 days (95% CI 3.10\u20133.37; 79.5% within 5 days) most RSV-associated hospitalizations were for acute bronchiolitis due to RSV accounting for 961 (92.2%) RSV-associated hospitalizations, followed by RSV pneumonia (52 cases; 5%), and acute bronchitis due to RSV (29 cases; 2.8%). infants 1 year of age accounted for 47 % of LRTI hospitalizations among all children. infants 1 year of age accounted for 77% RSV-specific LRTI hospitalizations among all children. average LOS among at-risk infants was significantly longer compared to other pediatric patients. the average length of stay (ALOS) among at-risk infants was significantly longer compared to other pediatric patients (9.1 days, vs. 3.10 days, respectively P 0.0001) bed occupancy was highest in January and February of 2009 and March of 2010. bed occupancy was highest in January and February of 2009 and March of 2010. lower respiratory tract infection hospitalization rates among all children 19 years of age and infants 1 year of age occurred between November and April. the average number of acute care beds required to treat pediatric LRTIs will be 20.7 among all children 0\u201319 years of age including 11.2 among the subpopulation of infants 1 year of age. in 2030, 22.8 acute care beds will be needed among all children 19 years of age including 11.0 among infants 1 year of age. this will increase to a maximum bed occupancy of 74 beds among all children including 47 among infants 1 year of age in the winter months. a public health prevention strategy that reduces LRTI hospitalizations by 12.5% may counteract the effects of population growth. in 2020, a 12.5% decrease in hospitalizations in an anticipated 19 year old British Columbia pediatric population of 1,025,000 could result in 307 less hospitalizations. in 2030, in a projected 19 year old population of 1,128,585, there could be 338 less hospitalizations, 513 less bed-days, and 1.4 less beds. the average LOS in hospital for LRTI as the primary diagnosis was 3.10 days (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.03\u20133.21; 82% within 5 days); this is equivalent to a yearly average of 19.6 acute beds required to treat pediatric LRTIs. most of the LRTI admissions were for an unspecified viral cause (2932/4588; 63.9%) s were for acute bronchiolitis due to RSV accounting for 1198 (86%) RSV-associated hospitalizations, followed by RSV pneumonia (ICD-10 code J12.1; 115 cases; 8.5%), and acute bronchitis due to RSV (ICD-10 code J20.5; 40 cases; 3.4%). LRTI as the primary diagnosis occurred in 2165 (75.9%) infants 1 year of age. infants 1 year of age accounted for 47 % of LRTI hospitalizations among all children. infants 1 year of age accounted for 77% RSV-specific LRTI hospitalizations among all children. average length of stay among high-risk infants was significantly longer compared to other pediatric patients. s 1 y Children 1\u201319 Total Risk level Count ALOS (95% CI) Count High risk 40 9.10 (5.5\u201312.7) 38 4.3 (0\u201315.1) 78 Healthy 2125 3.10 (3.0\u20133.2) 2385 3.0 (2.9\u20133.1) 4510 ALOS, Average Length of Stay. bed occupancy was highest in January and February 2009 and March 2010. 88.1% RSV hospitalizations among all children 19 years of age and 88.4% RSV hospitalizations among infants 1 year of age occurred between November and April. LRTI hospitalizations for 2020 and 2030 Population projections estimated a 6.6% growth in the pediatric population by 2020. LRTIs will be 20.7 among all children 0\u201319 years of age. this will increase to a maximum bed occupancy of 68. this will increase to a maximum bed occupancy of 74 beds among all children. this will increase to a maximum bed occupancy of 74 beds among all children. this will increase to a maximum bed occupancy of 74 beds among all children. a public health prevention strategy that reduces LRTI hospitalizations by 12.5% may counteract the effects of population growth. in 2020, a 12.5% decrease in hospitalizations in an anticipated 19 year old British Columbia pediatric population of 1,025,000 could potentially result in 307 less hospitalizations, 963 less bed-days, and 2.6 less beds required annually to treat LRTIs. infants 1 year of age accounted for 47 and 77% hospitalizations due to pediatric LRTIs and LRTIs specifically due to RSV. most pediatric hospitalizations attributable to LRTIs in British Columbia hospitals occurred between November and April. the LRTI burden on the healthcare system in British Columbia is expected to increase in the next 20 years. the study estimated an increase in the pediatric population of approximately 17% by 2030. but predictions describing the implementation and evaluation of effective public health prevention strategies indicate that such measures can potentially reduce the incidence of the severe viral infections that are predominant contributors to LRTI hospitalizations. LRTI hospitalization rates among all children 19 years of age and infants 1 year of age were higher than the average provincial rate. this study reflects the impact of LRTIs in a closed population [14] there are however limitations associated with this study. this study reflects the impact of LRTIs in a closed population. pediatric LRTIs are a significant burden on the acute care setting in British Columbia. this burden will increase in the next 20 years. the implementation of effective public health prevention strategies may be an important strategy for pediatric healthcare sustainability. prepub Acknowledgements This study was funded by Abbott Laboratories.
