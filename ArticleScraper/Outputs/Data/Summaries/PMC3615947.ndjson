{"summary": "the timeliness gap was calculated as the difference in days between the report release dates of the matching outbreaks in the WHO and ProMED-mail systems from 2003 to the end of June 2009. civil liberties scores were collected as indicators of the transparency of each country. world first learned of SARS via proMED-mail, a non-governmental global electronic reporting system, on February 10, 2003. reports by both systems were published 3 months after the outbreak first occurred. previous studies have confirmed its credibility [14-18]. internet-based sources of information allow timely detection of outbreaks. lack of transparency for political reasons, lack of consensus in policy and strategy and inadequate training and resources for health system personnel have all been cited as barriers to effective and timely global health surveillance. countries with strong civil liberties typically have well developed mass media capable of reporting infectious disease news promptly after its occurrence [22]. in countries with good civil liberties, ProMED-mail might receive reports of new emerging infectious diseases from individuals or the media and release the information earlier than the WHO. the timeliness gap between the official and non-official global surveillance systems might reflect the information delay due to political constraints. we first collected all avian flu and H1N1 disease outbreak reports released on the WHO Disease Outbreak News website from 2003 to the end of June 2009. each country report was matched with its corresponding report in ProMED-mail. outbreak reports for china, Taiwan and Hong Kong also separated for matching. the total number of points on the civil liberties checklists determines the civil liberties rating on a scale of 1 to 7, with 1 representing the highest degree of freedom and 7 representing the lowest. the details of the method are described in the methodology section of the Freedom House website [26] we used the human development indices from 2005 to represent the human development status of each country. the human development index remained stable from 2003 to 2007. the detailed methods used to determine each value are described in the Technical Notes section of the report. each country report was matched separately with its corresponding report in ProMED-mail. outbreak reports for china, Taiwan and Hong Kong were also separated for matching. the details of the method are described in the methodology section of the Freedom House website [26]. we divided the analysed countries into free, partly free and not free countries according to these scores. countries with civil liberties scores of 1 and 2 were designated as free countries, between 3 and 5 as partly free countries. countries with health workforce density scores within upper, middle and lower tertiles were defined as high, middle and low health workforce countries. timeliness gap was further divided into two groups with a cut-off point of 3 days. the average reporting timeliness gap of avian flu and H1N1 outbreaks was negatively associated with civil liberties rating. the longest reporting timeliness gaps for avian flu and H1N1 outbreaks were observed in free countries, followed by partially free countries. the shortest timeliness gaps were found in countries with low human development scores. the correlations between reporting timeliness gap and civil liberties, human development and health workforce indices are shown in Table 1. compared with non-free countries, partly free countries had a significantly higher likelihood of having a longer timeliness gap than non-free countries. the timeliness gap ranged from -37 to 54 days, i.e., reports in ProMED-mail appeared as many as 54 days earlier than the same reports from the WHO. the average timeliness gap of avian flu and H1N1 outbreak reports was 4.96 days, while the average timeliness gap of H1N1 outbreak reports was 2.26 days. the average reporting timeliness gaps for avian flu and H1N1 outbreaks were 4.81 days and 5 days respectively. the shortest timeliness gaps were observed in countries with medium health workforce density (3.14 days) 206 cases from 43 countries were considered to be reported in a timely fashion (timeliness gap shorter than 3 days) 116 cases from 37 countries had a timeliness gap of longer than 3 days. 98 (0.85-1.12) 0.74 Year 1.40 (1.20-1.65) 0.001*** p value 0.05** p 0.01 ***P 0.001. the cut-off point of timeliness gap is 3 days. the reporting timeliness gap between ProMED-mail and the WHO was larger in countries with better civil liberties. the finding that countries with greater civil liberties have longer timeliness gaps is consistent with our hypothesis that outbreak news is reported and disseminated more quickly and easily by the mass media in countries with greater civil liberties. ss gap and health workforce found no significant association between timeliness gap and health workforce. lack of significant association between timeliness gap and health workforce density may be attributed to these factors. authors declare that they have no competing interests.
