{"summary": "the study herds were selected from among farrow-to-finish herds that had been entered in the PigINFO system (n=119) between July 2013 and March 2015. data associated with the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infections in each herd were investigated by 15 veterinarians belonging to the Japan Association of Swine Veterinarians (JASV) the herd-level production data were obtained every 3 months from the PigINFO system [17] for each herd, the numbers of sows and mated gilts were counted at the end of each month. the average female inventory (AFI) for each herd was defined as the average number of sows and mated gilts in 2014. FI as the covariate, was performed among the three groups at different time points. RESULTS In the 38 PED-positive herds, PED was diagnosed in 23 herds in April, in 14 herds in May and in one herd in June. the average preweaning mortality in April\u2013June was significantly lower in the PED-negative group than in the L-PED-positive group. the values for these parameters were significantly lower in specific groups (S-PED-positive and L-PED-positive) than in the other group (PED-negative) at specific time points. Fig. 2. Average postweaning mortality. Fig. 4. Average litters per mated female per year. Fig. 6. Average litters per mated female per year. in many of the PED-positive herds, the clinical signs of PED were observed in the nursery and finishing barns. this is consistent with the evidence of higher POWM in the PED-positive herds. the increased POWM in the PED-positive herds in the present study was similar to that reported in a retrospective cohort study. the levels of PBA and LMFY in the PED-positive herds did not decline during the PED epidemic. a previous observational study indicated that only pregnant sows and gilts infected with PED at 0\u201330 days of pregnancy had smaller litters. if litter sizes are only reduced by PEDV infection within a particular gestational stage, the calculation of herd-level PBA may be insufficient. the estimated average loss for an L-PED-positive herd caused by the PED outbreak is estimated to be $314/sow ($322 0.97) based only on the fewer pigs marketed, the estimated average loss from the reduced MP was $395,326 ($314/sow 1,259)"}
