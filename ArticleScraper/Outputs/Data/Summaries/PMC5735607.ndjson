{"summary": "more than 80% of respiratory infections are associated with different viral infectious agents. the association between respiratory tract infections and different viral pathogens has been reported to vary between 40% and 90% [1\u20135] globally. the pitcher and catcher are two novel components used in TOCE assay. detection point is moved from the target sequence to the catcher duplex. this process offers the multiplex real-time PCR capability to Anyplex II RV16 kit. PCR Nucleic acids were extracted from all samples using Microlab Nimbus IVD (Seegene Inc.) RNAs were used for cDNA synthesis using cDNA Synthesis Premix (Seegene Inc.) each panel was used to detect 8 viruses with appropriate controls. retrospective cohort study included 2266 patients within an age range of 0 to 14 years from July 2014 to June 2015 with suspected acute respiratory illness and respiratory infection. patients were examined clinically and initially diagnosed by an admitting physician. each panel was used to detect 8 viruses with appropriate controls. two types of DNA and 14 types of RNA viruses were amplified and detected by using CFX 96 Real-Time PCR Thermal cycler (Bio-Rad) SV A in 124 samples (6.1%), HMPV in 99 samples (4.9%), Flu-A in 95 samples (4.7%), HEV in 92 samples (4.5%), Flu- B in 51 samples (2.5%), HCoV-OC43 in 50 samples (2.4%), PIV-3 in 31 samples (1.5%), HCoV-NL63 in 12 samples (0.6%), PIV-2 in 8 samples (0.4%), PIV-1 in 7 samples (0.3%), and HCo Statistically significant relationships were found between the detection of single and multiple virus infections in the AdV and HEV groups (P 0.05). in multiple viral infections coinfections were recorded among HRV (36.7%), AdV (35.2%), HBoV (11.2), RSV B (7.8%), and RSV (6.7%), respectively (Table 3). ation Tachypnea Dyspnea Chest pain Hypodynamia Bellyache Diarrhea Headache AdV 40 12 13 8 10 9 8 12 4 8 25 1 (11.6) (3.5) (2.3) (3.5) (3.5) (1.2) (2.3) (7.3) (7.3) (1.2) (1.2) (1.8) (2.3) (1.2) (2.9) (0.6) (1.2) (5.8) (1.8) HCoV-229E 2 3 2 (22.1) (15.8) (29.5) Flu-B 18 9 12 15 9 8 11 10 12 15 10 21 (35.3) (17.6) (23.5) (29.4) (17.6) (21.6) (19.6) (23.5) (29.4) (19.6) (21.6) (19.6) (23.5) (29.4) (19.6) (21.6) (19.6) (23.5) (29.4) (19.6) (41.2) HMPV 15 3 4 4 3 3 4 2 1 2 1 3 (15.2) (3.0) 0.05 0.41 0.28 0.35 Data presented as numbers and percentages (%), significant difference P 0.05. a higher infection percentage was detected among pediatric patients. most respiratory infections were recorded in the 1-to-5-year-old age group. influenza viruses (18.50%), RSV (7.86%), and AdV (3.47%) were found to be the most common respiratory pathogens. in single viral infections, HRV (41.2%), HMPV (15.3%) and HBoV (13.7%) were found most frequently. a strong association of rhinorrhea and hypodynamia was observed. a strong association of rhinorrhea and hypodynamia was observed. a strong association of rhinorrhea and hypodynamia was observed. data from the previous and following years could have provided more information on circulatory patterns of respiratory viruses. this study was conducted on a single site in the Riyadh region, and virus spread and circulation patterns are likely to differ."}
