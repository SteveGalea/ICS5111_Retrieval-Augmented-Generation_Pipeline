{"summary": "viruliferous and non-viruliferous WBPH is a great threat to rice production in eastasia. viruliferous and non-viruliferous WBPH have a very similar gene ontological distribution to other closely related rice planthoppers. the most prevalent rice viruses are plant-infecting reoviruses in the genera Phytoreovirus, Fijivirus and Oryzavirus of the family Reoviridae. the most prevalent rice viruses are plant-infecting reoviruses in the genera Phytoreovirus. phylogenetic analyses show that SRBSDV has a high sequence similarity with RBSDV. segments S1 and S10 have the highest relatedness. molecular functions of the translated proteins have not been documented. resources available for WBPH are still scarce and searches in GenBank identified only about 156 WBPH ESTs. this limited amount of data provides little information for transcriptional, proteomic, and gene functional analysis of WBPH. next-generation high-throughput DNA sequencing technique has provided unprecedented opportunities for gene discovery of WBPH. sequence data from the two libraries were combined, and 81388 unigenes were finally obtained with a mean length of 555 bp. the length distribution of total unigenes had similar patterns between viruliferous and non-viruliferous samples. however, some unigenes were obtained only from viruliferous or non-viruliferous samples. a total of 28909 (5.52% of all distinct sequences) unigenes provided a BLAST result. the species distributions of the best match result for each sequence were shown in Figure 2 and Table S2. the sequences of WBPH shared the highest similarity with the red flour beetle. approximately 18045 (58.23%) of the unigenes could be annotated in GO based on sequence homology. GO analysis also showed a similar distribution of gene functions for non-viruliferous and viruliferous WBPH. 7.26% of protein-coding sequences possessed such repeats. trinucleotide repeats are the most abundant microsatellites in coding ESTs. previous work revealed that (AAC) n is the most frequent motif in L. striatellus [16] Totally, 58% of the differentially expressed genes were up-regulated in the viruliferous WBPH. the detected fold changes (log2 ratio) of gene expression ranged from 15 to +16. more than 80% of the genes were up- or down-regulated between 1.0 to 5.0 fold. nine of the selected unigenes were inconsistent between DGE and qRT-PCR. this difference might be caused by a lower sensitivity of qRT-PCR than DGE. qRT-PCR analysis confirmed the direction of change detected by DGE analysis, indicating that our results are reliable.

GO has three ontologies: molecular function, cellular component and biological process. approximately 18045 (58.23%) of the unigenes could be annotated in GO based on sequence homology. the three sap-feeding planthopper species belong to the same family Delphacidae in the evolutionary level. 7.26% of protein-coding sequences possessed such repeats, according to predictions. trinucleotide repeats are the most abundant microsatellites in coding ESTs. the expressed transcripts were assigned into groups according to their functions. Totally, 58% of the differentially expressed genes were up-regulated in the viruliferous WBPH. the detected fold changes (log2 ratio) of gene expression ranged from 15 to +16. 225 out of 3315 genes (6.8%) were down-regulated in viruliferous WBPH. most of the genes involved in translation, amino acid metabolism, and biosynthesis of ribosomes, spliceosomes and aminoacyl-tRNAs were down-regulated by SRBSDV infection.

RNA interference (RNAi) silences gene expression through small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs. we used parallel pyrosequencing to collect ESTs from viruliferous and non-viruliferous samples of WBPH. the genes involved in primary metabolism, ubiquitin-proteasome, cytoskeleton dynamics and immune responses were up regulated in viruliferous WBPH. this pathway may play an important role in virus defenses. all plants were grown in soil at 251\u00b0C, 80% relative humidity in a growth incubator, under a long day photoperiod of 14 h in light and 10 h in darkness. sample preparation and RNA isolation After two days of feeding on uninfected rice, WBPH were maintained on uninfected rice seedlings for more than 12 days. raw reads from the images were generated by Solexa GA pipeline 1.6. all raw transcriptome data have been deposited in the SRA database. generated unigenes larger than 350 bp were analyzed by searching GenBank and Swissprot databases with the BLASTX algorithm. transcripts with Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) 0.5.8a [65] were output as RPKM (Reads Per Kilobase of exon model per Million mapped reads) values. the false discovery rate (FDR) was used to determine the threshold P-value in multiple tests. the differentially expressed genes were used for GO enrichment analyses as described [18] a no template control sample (nuclease free water) was included in the experiment to detect contamination and determine the degree of dimer formation. SRBSDV-infected and un-infected rice seedlings were collected from fields and then moved to a beaker after discarding the old leaves. after two days of feeding, the rice seedlings were gently turned upside-down, and the juvenile planthoppers were swept onto healthy rice seedlings. cDNA library preparation and Illumina sequencing for transcriptome analysis RNA was purified from 20 mg of pooled total RNA using Oligo (dT) magnetic beads. the cleaved poly-(A) RNA was transcribed using Oligo (dT) (Takara, Japan), and then second-strand cDNA synthesis was performed. Detection criteria were constrained to perfect repeat motifs of 1\u20136 bp and a minimum repeat number of 12, 8, 5, 5, 5 and 5, for mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexa-nucleotide microsatellites. analysis of differentially expressed genes between the non-viruliferous and viruliferous WBPH as described. qPR-PCR was carried out on the lightCycler 480@ II with lightCycler 480@ SYBR I Master (Roche Applied Science, Basel, Switzerland) under conditions: 95\u00b0C for 5 min; 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 10 s, 60\u00b0C for 15 s, and 72\u00b0C for 20 s. a no template control sample (nuclease free water) was included in the experiment to detect contamination and determine the degree of Table S4 SSR analysis of Sogatella furcifera transcriptome. general features of predicted microsatellites include distribution to different repeat type classes. table S5 Differently expressed transcripts assignments between viruferious and non-viruferious samples according to molecular, cellular, and biological functions."}
