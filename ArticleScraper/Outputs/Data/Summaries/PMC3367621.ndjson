{"summary": "serial nasopharyngeal, fecal, and serum specimens of patients were collected at hospitals by Guangzhou Municipal Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention. when possible SARS was diagnosed in the waitress on January 2, 2004, serum, throat and rectal swabs were obtained from all 6 palm civets. cells with or without SARS-CoV virus infection were harvested and fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA, USA) cells were then transferred to a 1.5-mL tube and centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 10 min. serum, throat and rectal swabs were obtained from all 6 palm civets at the restaurant. the animals were purchased from Xinyuan live animal wholesale market in Guangzhou. cells with or without SARS-CoV virus were harvested and fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 4 h and post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide for 1 h. the supernatant was removed and a 2% agarose solution was added to the cell pellet. cubes were cut and dehydrated in graded ethanol. a nasopharyngeal swab isolate from the waitress and a fecal specimen from the physician was obtained. the 2 S gene sequence fragments were identical, but differed from all S gene sequences available on public databases. rectal or throat swab specimens from 5 of the 6 palm civets were identical to 4 of 5 S gene sequences from the restaurant. a complete genome sequence of the SARS-CoV isolated from a palm civet was determined directly from the original sample and submitted to GenBank.

Isolation of virus with the FRhK-4 cell line was unsuccessful because the volume of specimen from patients was limited. a complete genome sequence of the SARS-CoV isolated from a palm civet was determined directly from the original sample and submitted to GenBank (accession no. AY572034). restaurant T G G C T T T A G G T T T A C G T G C G C G C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C HSZ-Bc Early phase C A A T C C T A T A C G C T T C C G T G T HSZ-Cb Early phase C A A T C C T A T A C G C T T C C C G T G T G T G T GZ50 Middle phase C A A T C T A T A C G C T T T T A T BJ01 Late phase C A A T C C T A T A C G C T T T T T A T T T the 4 signature nucleotide variations in 286-bp S gene sequences were identical to 4 of 5 S gene sequences of palm civets at the restaurant. IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV were detected in 2 (5.1%) of 39 employees of the restaurant. this was higher than that observed in the control groups (11%\u20133%) (11). four isolates (ZS-A, SZ-B, SZ-C, and HGZ8L1-A) had 18 of 21 SNVs. another group of 2 early isolates, HSZ-B and HSZ-C, had 19 SNVs. no sequences of these early-phase isolates have been observed in the middle or later phase of the epidemic. HGZ8L1-A, HSZ-B, HSZ-C, and GZ60 had 12 or 13 SAAVs (6). the S protein sequence predicted for the first SARS case of 2003\u20132004 had only 3 SAAVs (6). the 29-nt deletion was absent in all isolates from palm civets at the restaurant. group A is represented by viruses found in palm civets at the restaurant. analysis of complete genome sequences showed the same relationships. most recent SARS patients were therefore infected by SARS-CoV that is closely related to virus isolates from palm civets at the restaurant. a restaurant serving palm civets positive for this virus was the source of infection for 2 of 4 confirmed SARS patients during the resurgence of SARS in the winter of 2003\u20132004 (6,17). a restaurant serving palm civets was the source of infection for 2 of 4 confirmed SARS patients during the resurgence of SARS. the characteristic SNV pattern of S genes has 21 nt. virus isolated from palm civets at the restaurant had 0, 1, or 2 SNVs. however, viruses from several provinces of china and other countries had all 21 SNVs (7,10,14,15) SARS-like illness did not develop in any of the 257 contacts of the 4 patients. epidemiologic data can only provide clues to the biologic characteristics of the virus. experimental infection using animal models is necessary to measure the relative pathogenic potential of various strains of SARS-CoV isolated from human and animals."}
