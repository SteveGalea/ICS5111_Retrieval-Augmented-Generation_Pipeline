{"summary": "dengue disease is one of the most important arthropod-borne diseases in world public health. it is caused by 4 distinct antigenically related serotypes (DENV-1, -2, -3, -4) of dengue virus. the virus is transmitted by the bite of mosquitoes of the genus Aedes. the interactions between PAMPs and their corresponding PRRs activate various signaling pathways that finally lead to the production of proinflammatory cytokines and type I interferon (IFN-I) DENV has acquired various strategies that provide it with the capacity to inhibit IFN-I response and evades the host antiviral response mediated by this cytokine. 7 nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) involved in regulation of protein synthesis, in viral replication, in pathogenesis, and in the control of host antiviral response. innate immune response is responsible for the control of viral spread during the early stages of infection. FN-stimulated genes (ISGs) are involved in several cellular pathways. the most important are those generating an antiviral state in the cells affecting different steps of viral replication. a better understanding of the role of the innate immune response during DENV infection and of the evasion mechanisms developed by the virus. anoma differentiation-associated gene 5 recognizes RNAs bearing a triphosphate group at the 5\u2032 end and dsRNAs respectively. some authors report that RIG-I inhibits both DENV and Chikungunya virus infection by an IFN-I-independent mechanism. however, other authors have suggested that RIG-I activation by DENV may be involved in immunopathogenesis of DENV through the modulation of cytokine production. inducible-associated protein I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA-5) TLR3 senses double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) produced in DENV replication. TLR7 and TLR8 are endosomal receptors associated with the adaptor protein MyD88. the most important IFN-I-producing cells are the dendritic cells and the mononuclear phagocytes. most important IFN-I-producing cells are the dendritic cells and the mononuclear phagocytes. PKR is normally present as an inactive protein, but is activated in response to interaction with dsRNA generated during viral genome replication. PKR phosphorylates the alpha subunit of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2, promoting inhibition of translation and consequently inhibition of viral replication. only in recent years have studies aimed at understanding the role of PKR in the replication of DENV increase. the role of the 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) in DENV infection has also been studied. the role of the 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) in the control of DENV infection has also been studied. innate immune evasion mechanisms, specifically IFN-I evasion, could play an essential role in viral pathogenesis and in the severity of certain viral infections. a large number of viruses have developed extremely efficient strategies to suppress IFN-I production and antiviral activity in host-infected cells. different types of viruses can significantly vary in their capacity to induce IFN-I production. differences in such stimulation can be due to a variety of factors. a large number of viruses have been described that suppress IFN-I production through specific antagonists produced during replication. authors demonstrated that reduced IFN-I production by moDCs was related to delayed T lymphocyte activation evaluated in coculture. poor IFN-I production by deNV-infected DCs has also been described, even in presence of IFN-I inducers such as the NDV and Sendai virus. NV NS2B3 to LRR96Gleading to suppression of MITA. the viral protease was unable to degrade the murine homolog of MITA. MITA acts as an adaptor molecule involved in recruitment of TBK1 kinase 1. DENV infection induces the formation of vesicles and membrane complexes of 90 nm. these intracellular vesicles were derived from the cellular endomembrane complexes of the ER that contains pores believed to allow the liberation of newly synthesized RNAs. formation of these types of intracellular vesicles may avoid innate immune recognition of the viral particle or of different viral components by the cellular PRRs. 49 human cells with different plasmids expressed each of the 10 nonstructural proteins encoded by the DENV genome. only the expression of the nonstructural proteins, NS2A, NS4A, and NS4B, enhanced viral replication of NDV, which is highly sensitive to the IFN-I response. human K562 (lymphocytes) and THP-1 (monocytes) cell lines infected with the infectious DENV-2 clone pDVWS601 express low levels of the STAT2 signaling molecule. it has been suggested that the viral protein responsible for this regulation is NS5 since transfection of K562 cells with a lentiviral vector only expresses this nonstructural protein induced IFN-I inhibition. STAT2 degradation is species specific because NS5 is able to bind and degrade human STAT2 but not mouse STAT2. this becomes important because STAT2 restricts DENV replication in the first moments of mice infection in vivo. a phenotypic study was performed on 18 DENV isolates from children in Bangkok, Thailand, who presented dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever. the majority of the strains blocked IFN-I signaling, but no differences in the phenotypic characteristics between strains producing dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever. despite the fact that DENV replicates in the cytoplasm, it has been reported that NS5 is located in the nucle several miRNAs have been described with antiviral activity against viruses. such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), stomatitis virus, and Influenza virus (Otsuka and others 2007; Ahluwalia and others 2008; Song and others 2010). cellular miRNA-146a enhance DENV-2 replication in human cells. DENV evades the innate immune response mediated mainly by IFN-I. this immune evasion allows the virus to infect and replicate in several IFN-I-producing cells. this immune evasion allows the virus to infect and replicate in several IFN-I-producing cells."}
