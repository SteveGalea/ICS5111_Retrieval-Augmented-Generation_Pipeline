{"summary": "the etiological agent of this zoonosis, Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), is an arbovirus belonging to the family Bunyaviridae. RVFV infection is severe in animals, especially sheep, cattle, and goats, resulting in high mortality rates in newborns. retinal inflammation can lead to permanent vision loss in about 1\u201310% of infected patients. a second rearrangement of the trimer pulls the viral and cellular membranes into close proximity to allow membrane disruption and fusion to occur [14]. the hydrophobic residues of the stem region N-terminal to the transmembrane domain of E likely moves through a groove formed between domains II in the E trimer. a second rearrangement of the trimer pulls the viral and cellular membranes into close proximity to allow membrane disruption and fusion to occur. gp41 rearrangement in response to gp120 binding of CD4 and either the co-receptor CCR5 or CXCR4. this rearrangement exposes the C- and N-terminal heptad repeat domains. this binds to the exposed N-terminal heptad repeat when theses domains are exposed. this preventing completion of the second rearrangement and formation of the 6-helix bundle. peptides were initially resuspended in 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol overnight and dried in a vacuum centrifuge. stock solutions were generated by resuspending all peptides in 20\u201330% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and water (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) c MFLGWSFDFGSLWGNKPWF stem 450\u2013468 RVFV-10sc WSSGLPFGNFGLSWFDMGFWS stem 447\u2013467 Viruses, cells, and media RVFV vaccine strain MP12 [26], [27], the wild-type RVFV-ZH501 [4], [28], ANDV 808034 [29], and a green-fluorescent protein (GFP) tagged Zaire Ebolavirus, monolayers were washed once with phosphate buffered saline (PBS, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) and overlaid with EBME supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% non-essential amino acids, 4% L-glutamine (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY), 100 U/ml penicillin G, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 1 Fungizone (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) containing 0.6% (w/ MTT toxicity assay was assessed using the MTT cell proliferation assay (ATCC, Manassas, VA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. a biotin conjugated RVFV-6 peptide and a biotin-conjugated RVFV-6 scrambled peptide were synthesized. cell monolayers were briefly pre-fixed in 0.2% paraformaldehyde (E.M. Sciences, Warrenton, PA) after brief fixation, cells were washed in PBS and incubated with goat anti-biotin 15 nm IgG Gold antibody (Ted Pella, Redding, PA) after the brief fixation, the cells were fixed in with 2.5% glutaraldehyde (E.M. Sciences), scraped, and pelleted 25 l biotin-conjugated RVFV-6 or biotin-conjugated RVFV-6 scrambled peptide was incubated with streptavidin magnetic beads. after peptide binding to the beads, unbound peptide was washed away with Tris-buffered saline. blot washed in PBST and imaged using a camera system. two dilutions of RVFV or EboZ-eGFP were pre-treated for 1 h. total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) codon-optimized RVFV-ZH548 glycoproteins GnGc and codon-optimized T7 polymerase were previously cloned into the mammalian dual-expression vector pBud-CE4.1. the transfected cells were harvested using trypsin/EDTA (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) and seeded onto wells of an 8-well chamber slide (Lab-Tek II chamber slide RS, Wilmington, DE) cells were stained for 15 min with a 110 dilution of freshly prepared Giemsa stain. slides were air dried, mounted with a DAPI-containing mounting medium. a paired, two-tailed t-test was performed using Prism 5. the RVFV Gc amino acid sequence (GenBank P03518) was analyzed for a positive Wimley-White interfacial hydrophobicity score. regions selected for peptide generation include Gc domains IIa, IIb, III, and the stem region. peptide amino acid sequence domain location RVFV-1 YWTGSISPKCLSSRRCHLV IIa 72\u201390 RVFV-2 WGCGCFNVNPSCLFVHTYL IIa (fusion peptide) 131\u2013149 RVFV-3 LGASSSRFTNWGSVSLSLD IIb 185\u2013203 RVFV-4 FVGAAFLNLTGCY III 332\u2013350 RVFV-5 WNFFDWFSGLMSWFGGPLK stem 449\u2013468 the pseudotyped viruses RVF-VSV-luc and VSV-luc were provided by Dr. Robert Doms at the University of Pennsylvania. vero E6 cells were infected with 50\u201375 plaque forming units (pfu) of virus that was pre-incubated in cEMEM for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. luciferase activity was measured the following day using the Renilla Luciferase Assay System. luciferase activity was measured the following day using the MTT cell proliferation assay (ATCC, Manassas, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. in conjugated RVFV-6 peptide and a biotin-conjugated RVFV-6 scrambled peptide were synthesized. cells were transfected with a codon-optimized RVFV-ZH548 GnGc expression construct. cells were incubated with 25 M peptide in chamber slides for either 30 seconds or 1 h. blocks from each sample were ultra-thin sectioned using leica UC7 Ultramicrotome (Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL) the grids from each sectioned block were then post-stained with Reynold's lead citrate and viewed in a Tecnai Spirit Twin transmission electron microscope. virus bound to beads were lysed using 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) the beads were washed with TBS (or low pH medium) to remove unbound virus. the resolved proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose blot, blocked with 5% Difco (Becton-Dickenson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) in PBS (block), and incubated with a 11000 dilution cells were washed extensively with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to remove unbound virus. total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Bio-Rad, Hercules, NY) cells transfected with pVSV-G were seeded at 1105 cells/well. untransfected cells were added to bring the final concentration to 1105 cells/well. cEMEM was added to the wells to raise the pH. the experimentally determined structures of glycoprotein C from RVFV [37] (PDB code 4HJC), Semliki Forest virus [38] (PDB code 1RER) and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) [39] (PDB code 3J0C) were used to generate models for RVFV; VSV structure (PDB code:2CMZ) [40] was used to generate a complete VSV model of the fusion trimer of EB this peptide is based on the RVFV fusion protein Gc's stem region. this region included two different amino acids at the C-terminus. this region included two different amino acids at the C-terminus. for each virus, the VSV core is tagged with the reporter gene luciferase. eptides were screened for inhibition of the pseudotyped reporter viruses RVF-VSV-luc (A and C) and VSV-luc (B and D) the virus was incubated with peptides RVFV-6, -7, -8, -9, or -10 (A, B) or serial dilutions of RVFV-6, RVFV-10, or the scrambled peptides RVFV-6sc or RVFV-10sc (C RVFV-6sc did not inhibit RVFV-ZH501, RVFV-10sc did. serial dilutions of peptide were incubated with RVFV-ZH501 (A), EboZ-eGFP (B), or ANDV (C), before infecting a monolayer of Vero E6 cells. percent inhibition was determined for each virus using virus-only controls. RVFV-6 inhibited ANDV with nearly 100% reduction in plaques. the other viruses (RVF-VSV-luc, VSV-luc, ANDV, and EBOV) better than RVFV-10, RVFV-6 was selected for subsequent studies. RVFV-MP12 (A) or EboZ-eGFP (B) was incubated with 50 M RVFV-6 prior to the addition to a confluent monolayer of Vero E6 cells. cells were rinsed with PBS, and RNA was harvested using TRIzol. RVFV-6 peptide binding was rapid and could be detected at the earliest measured time (30 seconds, data not shown) the binding could also be visualized by electron microscopy of cells incubated with biotinylated RVFV-6 prior to fixing and staining. this results suggest that the RVFV-6 peptide binds non-specifically to the plasma membrane. RVFV-6 and to a lesser extent RVFV-6sc precipitated Gc. however, in the presence of the non-ionic detergent Triton X, Gc was not precipitated. a lesser amount of binding was observed with the scrambled peptide. this suggests that the amino acid order of the peptide by itself plays a role in the binding. RVFV-6 inhibits both RVFV and VSV cell:cell fusion. cells were transfected with plasmids expressing either the genes for RVFV GnGc or VSV G. cell-cell fusion was significantly inhibited for both RVFV and VSV transfected cells. fusion trimers of VSV G (Figure S2), EBOV GP2 and RVFV Gc (Figure S4) were built combining homology modeling, fold recognition, and ab initio techniques. all three models show hydrophobic patches located near the fusion loops and at the interface between monomers that can serve as the stem binding sites. five non-transmembrane domain regions within RVFV Gc were found with significant WWIHS values. peptides analogous to these five regions were synthesized. only RVFV-5 demonstrated inhibition (approximately 30%, data not shown) luciferase activity was measured as a surrogate for viral replication. all of the peptides inhibited both RVF-VSV-luc and VSV-luc. peptides were screened for inhibition of the pseudotyped reporter viruses. RVFV-6 was the more potent inhibitor of both RVF-VSV-luc and VSV-luc. the scrambled peptides did not demonstrate inhibition of either virus. further characterization of the RVFV stem peptides show broad, non-toxic viral inhibition. RVFV-6, RVFV-10, or the scrambled peptides RVFV-6sc and RVFV-10sc were incubated with serial dilutions of RVFV-6, RVFV-10, or the peptides RVFV-6sc. RVFV-6 inhibited the other viruses (RVF-VSV-luc, VSV-luc, ANDV, and EBOV) better than RVFV-10. RVFV-MP12 or EboZ-eGFP were incubated with or without RVFV-6. cells were washed with PBS to remove unbound virions. real-time PCR assays for RVFV [33] or EBOV [34] were used to quantify viral genomes present. cells were incubated with either biotin-conjugated RVFV-6 or biotin-conjugated RVFV-6sc. the peptide binding was rapid and could be detected at the earliest measured time (30 seconds, data not shown) the binding could also be visualized by electron microscopy of cells incubated with biotinylated RVFV-6 prior to fixing and staining. RVFV-6 peptide binds to RVFV at either neutral or low pH conditions. peptides bound to streptavidin beads were resolved by SDS-PAGE. western blots were probed with a monoclonal antibody to Gc. sc, or no peptide was pre-bound to avidin beads before the addition of RVFV-MP12. beads were washed to remove unbound virus and treated as indicated with lysis buffer and wash. protein bound to avidin beads were resolved by SDS-PAGE. fusion events (indicated with arrows) are shown in (A) and were quantified by number of syncytia per field of view at 100 in (B) results are representative of at least 3 experiments. a peptide (RVFV-6) analogous to the stem region of the putative fusion protein Gc of RVFV is capable of inhibiting multiple, diverse viruses in addition to RVFV. this binding would serve to both concentrate the peptide at the initial site of infection and also permit it to be internalized in concert with the virion. a stem-based peptide inhibitor of DENV, DN59, can induce the formation of holes in the viral membrane, triggering premature release of the genome that causes the viral particles to become non-infectious even before interacting with cells. panel A shows the initial stages of the membrane fusion process in bunyaviruses. RVFV-6 molecules outcompete the stem fragment and lead to inhibition of fusion by blocking the movement of the native stem. the stem fragments are shown as a red -helices docked into the stem binding sites. we have generated 3-dimensional models of complete fusion trimers for RVFV, VSV, and EBOV. we consider the most probable regions where the stems and the inhibitor RVFV-6 could bind in RVFV, VSV, and EBOV trimers. RVFV-6 could also block the functions of the structurally homologous regions of the ANDV, EBOV, and VSV fusion proteins following acidification and protein rearrangement. a stem-based peptide that impacts infectivity of viruses that utilize all three classes of viral fusion proteins can be exploited for the development of broadly active antiviral fusion inhibitors. we have identified a potentially conserved feature of these three classes of fusion proteins that can be exploited for the development of broadly active antiviral fusion inhibitors.
