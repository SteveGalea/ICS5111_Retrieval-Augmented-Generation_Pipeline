{"summary": "health organisations and providers operate at county, township, and village levels in rural areas. the public health sector is the main healthcare provider. in 2017, 82% of inpatient care was provided by public hospitals. government budgets for public hospitals increased by 1.5% 1 Escalating costs of medical care Overuse of healthcare and technologies Improving pricing policies and removing mark-up of drugs as a source of finance for all public hospitals. reforming public hospitals is important to tackle the problem of access to healthcare and financial protection because public hospitals account for more than 60% of total health expenditure. reform is particularly difficult because of the need to balance the interests of the public hospitals, which are mostly responsible for their own finances. total health expenditure as a proportion of the gross domestic product changed little between 2000 and 2008. but increased from 5.03% in 2009 to 6.36% in 2017.1 Trends in total health expenditure from 2000 to 2017 show faster increases in health expenditure by the government and social health insurance system. between 2003 and 2008, the proportion of patients who needed hospital care decreased by 4.5% (from 29.6% to 25.1%) the proportion decreased by 8.0% between 2008 and 2013. between 2000 and 2005, more than 50% of total health expenditure came from out-of-pocket payments. between 2000 and 2005, more than 50% of total health expenditure came from out-of-pocket payments. since then the proportion of health expenditure from out-of-pocket payments has declined. the proportion of patients who did not use inpatient care decreased by 8.0% between 2008 and 2013. the proportion of patients who needed hospital care declined from 17.6% in 2008 to 7.4% in 2013.12 Changes in proportion of unmet needs were similar to inpatient care. in 2010, 5.6% of the doctors in township health centres had a formal medical education (five years of medical school),16 which increased to only 10% in 2017.1 Incentives to attract and retain more qualified health professionals in the primary care system are essential to improve quality of care. in general hospitals, medical expenditure per patient discharged increased by 17.2% between 2005 and 2008, and by 22.1% between 2010 and 20131. health resources are skewed to the hospital sector rather than primary and preventive care, although these two services are important determinants of efficiency. in 2016, the rate of hospital admission in china was 16.4%, higher than the average for countries of the oec. in general hospitals, medical expenditure per outpatient visit increased by 17.2% between 2005 and 2008 and by 22.1% between 2010 and 2013.1 16 Changes in costs for outpatient care were similar. the proportion of out-of-pocket payments for healthcare decreased, but the financial burden of using healthcare did not fall much. more effective mechanisms are needed to improve intersectoral coordination for health. delivery of health services should be people centred, integrated, and cost effective, and ensure continuity of care. many health institutions lack motivation to cooperate with others. reform of payment system should be accelerated and cost containment and quality improved. incentives should be adapted to strengthen the primary healthcare system. health indicators should be included in the social and economic development agenda. a health impact assessment system should be developed to generate more resources and effort from all related sectors to achieve better population health. central and local governments have mobilised substantial political and financial resources to implement the reform. translation chinesetranslation.bmj.l2349.pdf (673.3KB, pdf)."}
