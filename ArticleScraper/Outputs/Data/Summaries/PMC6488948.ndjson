{"summary": "type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is becoming a crucial threat to human health, with approximately 425 million individuals worldwide in 2017. it is estimated that the number will exhibit a 45% increase in three decades. chronic hyperglycemia causes macrovascular and microvascular complications and remodeling in the heart, kidneys, eyes, and nerves. the pharmaceutical composition of Tangminling pill comprises extracts of the following ten traditional Chinese herbs. it was manufactured and capsulated with specific processing of Chinese herbal medicine in Tasly Pharmaceutical (Tianjin, China) data search and selection Relevant RCTs were identified from the following data sources: Medline, China VIP, China National Knowledge Internet, and Cochrane library. literature searched with the terms (\u2018Tang-min-ling\u2019 or \u2018TM81\u2019 or \u2018Tangminling\u2019 or \u2018TML\u2019) AND (\u2018diabetes\u2019 or \u2018T2DM\u2019). Publication status, language, and date were not restricted. chi-square P was 0.10 and I2 was >50%. pooled WMDs with 95% CIs were analyzed. sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate individual effects and explain possible heterogeneity. the chemical composition of Tangminling pill was further analyzed using the high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS) method. the study project conformed to the ethical rules of the Helsinki Declaration (revised edition in October 2013) literature search and data extraction were performed blindly by two authors. heterogeneity was evaluated by the Cochran\u2019s Q statistic and the inconsistency index (I2) sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate individual effects. the loss to follow-up was 10% in all RCTs. the methodological quality of the retrieved studies was generally high. blood glucose improvement was evaluated by reductions of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels. HOMA-190 494 0.44 [0.27, 0.61] 0.001 36% >0.05 [8,10,12] Abbreviations: BMI, body weight index; HOMA-IR, homeostatic model assessment to -cell function; PG, postprandial plasma glucose; WC, waist circumference. also, Tangminling pill significantly ameliorated obesity, which was expressed as reductions of waist circumference (WC) and body mass index (BMI) in T2DM patients subgroup analyses concerning FPG, BMI, WC, and HOMA-IR were conducted. the heterogeneity among trials was partially explained by the variability in doses of the medication and subject numbers. the heterogeneity among trials was partially explained by the variability in doses of the medication and subject numbers. HOMA-IR Adjustment for doses 12 g 71 0.68 [0.19, 1.17] 0.01 NA NA [11,12] 6 g 492 0.10 [0.17, 0.38] >0.05 71% >0.05 [8,10,11] Adjustment for subject numbers >100 399 0.00 [0.02, 0.02] >0.05 NA NA [8] 100 164 0.40 [0.14, 0.66] 0.01 43% >0.05 [10,12] Publication bias Nfs0.05 values Tangminling pill significantly reduced WC (1.04 vs. 0.36 cm, P0.001) and BMI (0.37 vs. 0.11 kg/m2, P=0.05) from baseline in comparison with placebo treatment in T2DM patients. Tangminling significantly decreased HOMA- level from baseline as compared with placebo (4.28 vs. 0.41, P0.001) the safety of Tangminling pill was also confirmed, without serious adverse events reported in all the four RCTs. doses 12 g 208 0.21 [0.31, 0.73] >0.05 0% >0.05 [11,12] 6 g 628 0.33 [0.33, 0.69] >0.05 95% 0.001 [8,10,11] Adjustment for subject numbers >100 672 0.53 [0.36, 0.70] 0.001 13% >0.05 [8,11] 100 164 0.16 [0.03, 0.29] 0.01 0% >0.05 [10,12] WC Adjustment for doses 12 g traditional Chinese medications, mainly edible herbs, have been widely used in clinical practice in china for more than 2000 years. ten traditional Chinese herbs were extracted and included in Tangminling pill. three bioactive alkaloids have been isolated from Rhizoma coptidis. leukin-1 (IL-1) expression, activating Akt and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/NAD(P)H:quinine oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) signaling pathways and inhibiting lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4)-mediated pathway. gonin improved peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR-) activity in adipocytes and type 1 diabetic mice. flavanones naringenin and hesperetin from Citrus aurantium L exhibited anti-depressant [49], antioxidant [50], and anti-atherogenic [51] effects. antioxidative [17] - inhibiting PPAR- and C/EBP- [21]; increasing adipose triglyceride lipase [20]; increasing adipose triglyceride lipase [20]; increasing adipose triglyceride lipase [20]; - inhibiting NF-B [23, 24]; - increasing adipose trig [44] modulating TGF-/Smad signaling pathway [40]; promoting islet -cell function [41]; promoting islet -cell function [41]; - modulating MAPK sighnaling [44] cell cultures; rodent models Scutellaria baicalensis Georg Wogonin - cardioprotective [42]; - anti-inflammatory [42]; - antioxidative [42]; - anti-oxidative [42]; rodent models Radix Trichosanthis Trichosanthin - anti-tumor; anti-HIV; immunosuppressive [60] - inhibiting cell growth and inducing apoptosis. T2DM is a chronic metabolic disease in which the deterioration of glycemic control is associated with progressive islet -cell dysfunction. our analyses revealed that Tangminling reduced blood glucose mildly, without hypoglycemic events reported. there was a significant disparity in sample sizes among the four RCTs included in our pooled analyses. however, after excluding this study, no substantial alteration was found in pooled WMDs. funding This work was supported by the clinical medicine science and technology innovation plan of Jinan Science and Technology Bureau. the planned science and technology project of Guangdong province was supported by the Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation. authors read and approved the manuscript."}
