{"summary": "the rat origin has been previously confirmed. male db/db (BKS.Cg-Dock7m>+/+Leprdb>/J) mice homozygous for Leprdb> were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. plasmids for human ACE2 (hACE2/pcDNA3.1) and mouse ACE2 (mACE2/pcDNA3.1) were previously described. plasmid for mouse ADAM17 (pAd17E406A) was purchased from Addgene (catalog number 19141). transfections Rat insulinoma 832/13 cells were transfected with plasmids pEGFP-C3 and pACE2-Tom. the medium was changed the day after transfection. cells were scraped from the plates, washed with Dulbecco's PBS. mouse ACE2 was detected with an anti-ADAM17 antibody (ab2051; Abcam) the epitopes recognized by this antibody are identical in mouse and rat ADAM17. RNA from islets and islet cell fractions was isolated with an RNeasy minikit (Life Technologies) mRNAs were assayed using Power SYBR Green RNA-to-CT one-step kit (Life Technologies) relative to -actin mRNA or 18S rRNA. DX600 was omitted from the measurements of ACE2 from transfected 832/13 cells. the enzyme activity cleaving Mca-APK(Dnp) is almost entirely due to ACE2 in these cells (16) control strength is determined as the slope of a plot of the natural logarithm of ACE2 activity vs the natural logarithm of P. data were analyzed by paired t tests, t tests, or an ANOVA. animals were killed at ages of 8 weeks (56 and 57 d), 12 weeks (84 and 85 d), and 15 weeks (107 and 108 d) plasma from whole blood was collected and stored at 80\u00b0C until analysis. the whole population picked from each mouse was used for either RNA isolation or ACE2 protein assays. plasmid for mouse ADAM17 (pAd17E406A) was purchased from Addgene (catalog number 19141) (18) plasmid pACE2-Tom for CAG promoter-driven coexpression of mACE2 and tdTomato was generated based on pCAGEN from Addgene. additional SacI and MluI restriction sites were inserted into the multicloning site. Flow cytometry Rat insulinoma 832/13 cells transfected with plasmids pEGFP-C3 and pACE2-Tom were analyzed for green and red fluorescence on FACSAria and LSRII flow cytometers. cells were sorted on FACSAria and LSRII flow cytometers after excitation at 488 nm using GFP and phycoerythrin channels. RNA from islets and islet cell fractions was isolated with a RNeasy minikit. target mRNAs were assayed using power SYBR Green RNA-to-CT one-step kit. ACE2 activity was measured from protein extracts using the fluorogenic substrate Mca-APK(Dnp) as previously described (19) activities are expressed in fluorescence units per minute. activity cleaving Mca-APK(Dnp) is almost entirely due to ACE2 in these cells. fluorescence at 520 nm after excitation at 490 nm was measured for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C. slopes in fluorescence development were calculated between the 10- and 60-minute time points. statistical analysis and curve fitting were performed using Prism 5.03 (GraphPad Software) results ACE2 shedding occurs in insulinoma cells overexpressing ACE2. the small size difference between intact and shed ACE2 makes it difficult to distinguish between these two forms. 103 kDa and 88 kDa forms possibly correspond to pro-ADAM17 and mature ADAM17 (22). for the highest concentration of pAd17 expression (2 g/well), there were significantly increased concentrations of shed ACE2. d ACE2 contains the catalytic domain of ACE2. cells transfected with ACE2 expression plasmids had hydrolytic activity against ACE2. ACE2 activity was significantly increased at the highest level of the ADAM17 expression plasmid. ADAM17 decreases cellular ACE2 levels with the empty expression plasmid pcDNA3.1() as control for the ADAM17 expression plasmid. there was no significant decrease in the cellular ACE2 levels despite the increased shedding of ACE2. overexpressed ADAM17 affects ACE2 levels. 832/13 cells were transfected with 0.5 g/well mACE2/pcDNA3.1. pcDNA3.1() differs from the ADAM17 plasmids in their effect on ACE2 expression. cells were trypsinized and mixed for coculture of ACE2-expressing cells and cells overexpressing either active or inactive ADAM17. the next day, cells were trypsinized and mixed for coculture of ACE2-expressing cells and cells overexpressing either active or inactive ADAM17. pAd17 resulted in an approximately 20-fold increase in ADAM17 activity compared with the controls. mACE2/pcDNA3.1 tended to be higher with the overexpression of active ADAM17 than with pcDNA3.1(). pAd17E406A was significantly lower for pAd17 than for pcDNA3.1(). the total amount of ADAM17 activity was fairly stable, whereas ACE2 activity increased 64%. thus, ADAM17 overexpression has the potential to decrease cellular ACE2 levels by shedding within a wide range of ACE2 expression levels. the next day, transfected cells were trypsinized and mixed for subsequent coincubation of the individually transfected cells. overexpression of ADAM17 decreases ACE2 stability. we measured stability by determining the total content of cellular ACE2 activity. the initial half-lives were calculated from exponential degradation curves. control strength of ADAM17 on ACE2 expression We aimed to determine the control strength of ADAM17 on ACE2 shedding and cellular ACE2 expression. wells with 832/13 cells were transfected with 25 ng mACE2/pcDNA3.1 and 2 g of a mix of expression plasmids for active and inactive ADAM17. the population of purely red fluorescent cells seen in the lower left panel of Figure 5C is more than 99% shifted to cells coexpressing red and green fluorescence when pEGFP-C3 is cotransfected. with 25 ng pACE2-Tom per well in cotransfections, the level of red fluorescence was lower, but cotransfection efficiency was still greater than 99%. thus, it is reasonable to assume practically all cells transfected with mACE2 will also be trans 17 used in the transfection experiments, shed ACE2 (D) and cellular ACE2 (E) were plotted against the estimated ADAM17 activity of transfected cells, ie, corrected for the transfection efficiency. curves describing saturation kinetics were fitted to the data. double-heterozygous mice express high levels of the red fluorescent tdTomato protein in -cells. compared with single-heterozygous Ins2-CRE+/ or Tom+/ mice, double-heterozygous mice possess a cell population from pancreatic islets with very high red fluorescence. mRNA and less glucagon and somatostatin mRNA than non-red cells. the concentration of ADAM17 mRNA in the -cell-enriched population was significantly smaller (56% of the concentration for non-red cells). ACE2 activity in the -cell-enriched population was only 12% of the ACE2 activity in non-red cells. the highest level was observed in the oldest db/db mice. the highest level was observed in the oldest db/db mice. the highest level was observed in the oldest db/db mice. the hydrolytic activity of the fluorogenic substrate was significantly increased in db/db mice. db/db mice show a different expression of ACE2 mRNA relative to db/m mice. this contrasts with regulation in liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue. 832/13 cells were transfected in four experiments with 100 ng/well mACE2/pcDNA3.1 and cotransfected with 2 g/well of pAd17 or pAd17E406A. a slight decrease in shedding by DPC-333 when inactive ADAM17 is overexpressed may be due to inhibition of the endogenous ADAM17. s of the islets were incubated for 24 hours in RPMI 1640 medium without serum. we determined the cellular ACE2 activity (C) and calculated the ratio of total shed ACE2 activity to total cellular ACE2 (D) the shed form of the hACE2-GFP fusion protein should have the same size as shed hACE2. an approximately 102-kDa shed form of mACE2 is also apparent and distinguished from the 102-kDa full-length mACE2. cellular ACE2, ACE2 released into the cell culture medium, and cellular ADAM17 respectively. band intensities were normalized relative to the average intensity of bands of interest on each blot. select culture broths from the experiments outlined in Figure 1 were tested for hydrolytic activity against the ACE2 substrate Mca-APK(Dnp) the ACE2 activities of 832/13 maintenance medium stored at 4\u00b0C, after an overnight incubation at 37\u00b0C and after an overnight incubation with untransfected 832/13 cells at 37\u00b0C were determined. 832/13 cells were transfected with 4, 20, 100, or 500 ng mACE2/pcDNA3.1 per well and cotransfected with 2 g/well of pAd17, pAd17E406A or pcDNA3.1(). levels of ACE2 mRNA were similar for pAd17 and pAd17E406A but were twice as high as in the cells transfected with pcDNA3.1(). 832/13 cells were cotransfected four times with 25 ng mACE2/pcDNA3.1 and 2 g pAd17 per well. cells were trypsinized and mixed for coculture of ACE2-expressing cells. overexpression of ADAM17 affects ACE2 shedding at different expression levels of ACE2. we transfected cells with 2 g ADAM17 expression plasmid or control plasmids per well. the increase in ADAM17 activity after transfection with pAd17 was only 3.7- to 5.2-fold, which is low compared with the greater than 200-fold increase observed for ADAM17 mRNA. pAd17E406A tended to be higher for pAd17 than for pcDNA3.1(). the cellular ACE2 level for pAd17E406A was significantly higher than for pcDNA3.1(). the ratio of total secreted ACE2 activity to total cellular ACE2 activity is clearly increased with the overexpression of active ADAM17. mACE2/pcDNA3.1 used in transfections shows near straight lines for both cellular and shed ACE2. control strengths of the ACE2 expression plasmid on ACE2 activity levels are estimated as the slopes of these lines. overexpression of ADAM17 decreases ACE2 stability. the total ACE2 activity (A) and ADAM17 activity (B) were measured for up to 21 hours. the ratio of total shed ACE2 to total cellular ACE2 activity was also determined. the fraction of cells with green fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry. the fraction of cells with green fluorescence was estimated by transfection of cells with 0.5 g pACE2-Tom and cotransfection with 2 g of either pAd17 or 2 g pEGFP-C3 per well. the population of purely red fluorescent cells seen in the lower left panel of Figure 5C is more than 99% shifted to cells coexpressing red and green fluorescence when p green fluorescent 832/13 cells transfected with 2 g pEGFP-C3 and 25 ng mACE/pcDNA3.1 were determined as in the upper right panel compared with control cells in the upper left panel. to estimate cotransfection efficiency, cells cotransfected with a plasmid encoding the red fluorescent tdTomato and pAd17 were compared to cells cotransfected with plasmids for eGFP and td the control strengths are illustrated in Figure 5F. the control strength for shed ACE2 is low due to ACE2 activity released into the medium. it should also be noted that the control strength of ADAM17 for cellular ACE2 approaches 0 for very low ADAM17 activities. red and non-red islet cells were sorted from each other and used for RNA isolation or ACE2 protein assays. red fluorescent cells express more insulin 2 mRNA and less glucagon and somatostatin mRNA than non-red cells. expression levels of ACE2 and ADAM17 in db/db and db/m mice were compared at 8, 12, and 15 weeks of age. db/db mice had higher body weight and fasting blood glucose levels than controls as well as a higher nonfasted plasma glucose level. db/db mice showed a decrease in islet insulin 2 mRNA expression over time. db/db mice showed a decrease in islet insulin 2 mRNA expression. db/db mice showed a decrease in islet insulin 2 mRNA expression. mRNA (C) and mRNA (C) were determined. 832/13 cells were transfected in four experiments with 100 ng/well mACE2/pcDNA3.1. cells were incubated in the absence or presence of 1 M. we determined the cellular ACE2 activity (A) and calculated the ratio of total shed ACE2 activity to total cellular ACE2 (B) the main effect for sex was significant at P.001 for cellular ACE2 activity. the level of ACE2 in a cell will be determined by the balance of synthesis and degradation of ACE2. we investigated the hypothesis that loss of ACE2 from pancreatic islets during diabetes is caused by enhanced shedding due to elevated levels of ADAM17. a high background of shedding caused by enzymes that are apparently not ADAM17. the control strength would be close to +1.0 at low ADAM17 activity levels and decrease to 0 as saturation occurs. the apparent K0.5 value for shed ACE2 seems lower than cellular ACE2. inhibition of proteasome pathway by MG132 has further been shown to increase ACE2 protein levels (29). it is not known whether this profile would be affected in pathological conditions in which endogenous ADAM17 would be overexpressed. both ACE2 and ADAM17 are expressed in mouse islets. a similar lack of change in expression in ACE2 mRNA and activity was observed in high-fat diet-fed, hyperglycemic mice compared with regular diet-fed mice. however, with the depletion of total islet mass as diabetes progresses, it is likely that loss of islets and their associated ACE2 contribute to an overall decrease of ACE2 levels in the whole pancreas. we have measured the ACE2 mRNA and ACE2 activity in the total population of islets collected from each individual mouse. we conclude that islet ACE2 is not generally depleted in diabetes beyond the reduction in islet mass that occurs during the disease. the beneficial effects of exogenous ACE2 that we have observed, leading to improved glycemic regulation (3, 4)"}
