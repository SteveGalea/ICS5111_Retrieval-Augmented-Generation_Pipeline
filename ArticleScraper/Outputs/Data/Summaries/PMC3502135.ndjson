{"summary": "questionnaires were administered to patients, visitors, non-clinical staff and volunteers. data were collected on knowledge, preventative measures, information sources, attitudes to government and media reporting, perceived seriousness, behaviour change and intended compliance with future measures. independent assessment of public health campaigns for pandemic prevention and control is scarce. the success of these campaigns depends on the health literacy of the public about the topic. beliefs about the competency of the authorities and the media in dealing with pandemic information also contribute to understanding [5] the sample size of 252 respondents was a convenience sample of patients in the ED over the study period. a target of 250 patients was chosen to provide a probable broad representation of the ED population. 21 (6.6%) declined to participate and 14 (4.4%) were excluded because of insufficient English. median age was 36 (range 18 to 83) years. 4 12 4.8 2.6\u20138.4 Unemployed 9 3.6 1.8\u20137.0 Can work from home5 Yes 46 18.3 13.8\u201323.8 No 131 52.0 45.7\u201358.3 Do not work 55 21.8 17.0\u201327.5 Did not answer 20 7.9 5.0\u201312.1 Internet Use At least once per week 180 71.4 65.3\u201376.8 Less often than once per week 61 24.2 19.1\u201330.1 Did not answer 11 4.4 2.1\u20137.6 Status (N more than half of respondents (144 [57%]) were aware of communications from the DHS. only 19% (35) correctly identified diarrhoea as a possible symptom. 79 per cent of respondents did not consider pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza to be potentially fatal but still considered it to be a serious disease. only 21% thought that the pandemic would return.
