{"summary": "chronic viral infections can be categorized into: 1- Latent (lack of substantial viral production between initial and late stages); 2- Productive (persistent viral production between beginning and late stages); and 3- Slow infection (increasing viral production from incubation period to late stages) During acute viral infection, the balance swings in favor of viral production, leading to the expression of viral genes. the magnitude of the CD8+ T-cell response following persistent viral infection can be substantial and it is essential that most of the expanded cells die after antigen clearance to maintain lymphoid homeostasis. the average telomere length for naive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells is 2.5 kb longer than effector or memory T cells. antigen-specific T and B cells can up-regulate telomerase activity during the initial response to acute infection. however, telomerase activity is not retained after resolution of acute viral infection. despite the preservation of telomere length, telomerase activity is not retained. cellular replication in the absence of telomerase expression results in progressive telomere shortening. a single dysfunctional telomere is sufficient to cause telomere end replication problems and increase chromosomal instability, degradation, and fusion. a deleterious consequence of excessive telomere shortening is the premature induction of replicative senescence of CD8+ T cells. senescent cells are unable to expand, but they can survive for extended periods of time, occupying immunological space. accumulation of CD8+CD28CD27 cells occurs during normal aging and chronic-antigen stimulation. loss of CD28 can be delayed in HIV-specific T cells transduced with telomerase, suggesting that telomere dynamics provide some intracellular signal for extinction of CD28 expression. in some T cells progressing to senescence, apoptotic markers have been found. apoptotic markers have been found, such as low expression of the anti-apoptotic gene, B-Cell CLL/Lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), and up-regulation of cell death markers. these markers lead to p53-mediated cell death by apoptosis. in vitro-based studies have shown that repeat antigenic encounters lead to resistance to CD95 and activation-induced cell death. cells exposed long-term to antigen also showed increased expression of Bcl-2-Like Protein-1 (Bcl-xl) and reduced expression of pro-apoptotic proteins Bad and Bax. exhausted T cells show progressive losses in antiviral functions. proliferative capacity is diminished, followed by sequential loss of interleukin-2 (IL-2) production, cytolytic killing, decreased tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and decreased interferon-gamma (IFN) production. decreased degranulation, all of which can result in clonal deletion. decrease in effector cytokines and, over time, the appearance of T cells displaying hallmarks of exhaustion. this includes the up-regulation of inhibitory markers on the surface of the T cell. this includes a differential loss (IL-2, TNF, and IFN-) in cytokine expression, impaired CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell effector response, and impaired memory T cells that are no longer responsive to IL-7 or IL-15. the most well-known and highly expressed inhibitory marker on exhausted T cells is Programmed Death receptor (PD-1), a member of the CD28 co-stimulatory family. PD-1 modulates the T-cell response to infection, reduces CTL effectors, and decreases proliferation of specific effector memory CD8+ T cells. exhausted CD4+ T cells express similar inhibitory markers and transcriptional factors as their counterpart CD8+ cells, including PD-1. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) also have altered functions during chronic viral infections. chronic viral infection leads to up-regulation of PD-1 on the surface of Tregs and enhanced Treg proliferation. ART treatment can effectively control CD4+ T-cell counts and viremia, but an unintended consequence is a rise in CD8+ T-cell levels. ART treatment can effectively control CD4+ T-cell counts and viremia, but an unintended consequence is a rise in CD8+ T-cell levels. most HIV-specific CD8+ T cells have an intermediate phenotype in which they still express CD27. a major consequence of harboring HIV-exhausted T cells is premature aging. telomerase activity decreased telomere lengths in CD4+ and CD8+ populations. this suggests that CD4+ T cells do not undergo replicative senescence in HIV infection. however, the fact that CD8+ T cells demonstrated shorter telomeres was in line with T-cell senescence. HBV and HCV are the major causes of acute liver infection. however, only HBV and HCV are responsible for a large proportion of global, chronic liver disease. a delayed immune response to the ever-changing viral mutational landscape allows the virus to adapt and persist. chronic HCV patients have shorter telomeres in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. telomere lengths were comparable to those of normal aging of 10 years. telomere lengths were followed over 15 years in individuals infected with HCV or dual HCV/HIV. chronic HCV patient CD8+ T cells showed lower CD3+ and CD4+ T-cell counts, suggesting immune impairment from long-term exposure to HBV. exhausted viral-specific T cells have been described for both HBV and HCV. telomere dynamics and slowed replication are altered in exhausted HBV-specific T cells. exhausted inhibitory receptor phenotype varies according to the inhibitory marker and level of expression. CD127 is up-regulated on effector and memory T cells, and is a marker for the activated state during HBV acute infection. in other chronic viral infections, such as HIV, impaired proliferation was seen. a majority of the chronic latent viruses discussed are known to be oncogenic. only studies have demonstrated telomere attrition in EBV-specific T cells. an additional obstacle to the study of telomere exhaustion is the lack of data owing to the endemic nature of some of these viruses. in one patient, VZV-specific T-cell proliferation and telomere lengths actually increased during a period of shingles [95] a larger study may demonstrate that reactivation of the virus from latency can induce telomere elongation in these cells or, more likely, that newly activated nave effector T cells are converted to new memory cells. unlike VZV, HTLV-I is not endemic in the population. profound T-cell dysfunction has been found in HTLV-specific CD8+ T cells. HTLV-I-specific CD8+ T cells have been found in HTLV carriers and ATL and TSP patients. prevailing theory is that a dysfunctional CTL response against the HTLV virus may lead to reduced elimination of HTLV-I cells from the host. the expression of the co-inhibitory marker, T cell immunoglobulin and ITIM domain (TIGIT), was increased by viral proteins and suppressed T-cell responses. blocking either TIGIT or PD-1 led to enhanced immune response to HTLV-I in TSP patients. phenotypes of effector memory T cells (CD45RA+/CCR7) and terminally differentiated effector memory cells (CD45RA/CCR7) have defects in telomerase expression in total PBMCs. telomere dysfunction and senescence in HTLV-specific CD8+ T cells has never been investigated in these patients. level of PD-1 expression on EBV-specific CD8+ T cells was nearly equal to that of HIV CD8+ T cells. administration of PD-L1 caused enhanced proliferation and cytokine expression, and restored antitumor immunity. telomere lengths remained unchanged immediately following and immediately following AIM. chronic EBV exposure leads to replicative senescence of EBV CD8+ T cells. telomerase, shorter telomere lengths, and a more differentiated state. no study has been done to examine telomere length on HHV-8-specific memory cells. patients with KS had lower amounts of HHV-8-specific CD8+ T cells. this was seen in both HIV-related KS and classic KS. PD-1 was expressed on natural killer cells (NK) of KS patients. PD-L1 staining was also found on some cells of HHV-8-associated diseases. telomere length measurements and T-cell exhaustion markers may need to be analyzed on memory CD8+ T cells from the mucosa. most studies have not directly assessed the phenotype of HPV-specific CD8+ T cells, i.e., inhibitory markers or cytokine profile. this was seen in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) patients. telomere lengths were significantly shorter in all stages of disease. telomere attrition in the PBLs of HPV-infected individuals. anti-exhaustion therapy should be given at the proper time, before cells become permanently differentiated. in a subset of CD8+ T cells exposed to chronic viral infection, expression of the T-cell factor-1 (TCF-1) gene has been shown to be elevated. another concern is whether anti-exhaustion therapy can fully reactivate viral-specific pools of memory T cells. the use of pembrolizumab and nivolumab has not yet been approved for chronic viral infections. a phase 2 trial for nivolumab on HPV-associated squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal showed complete or partial responses in some patients. a single chromosome harboring a critically short telomere can initiate senescence. studies will need to be repeated to look at the individual chromosome level. mice have extremely long telomeres than humans. telomerase loss and telomere shortening have been described in immune senescence. the molecular mechanisms responsible for shutting down telomerase expression have not been elucidated. telomerase shortening and immune senescence may be similar in chronic infections."}
