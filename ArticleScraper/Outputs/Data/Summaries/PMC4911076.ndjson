{"summary": "87 episodes of febrile neutropenia in children aged 0\u201318 years were treated at a children\u2019s oncology unit between January 2013 and June 2014. follow-up samples were collected from children who tested positive for one or more respiratory viruses. rhinoviruses were the most frequently detected. rile neutropenia is associated with long hospitalization [3\u20135] which has negative social effects for the child and its family. hospitalization and the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics increase the patient\u2019s risk of subsequent infection with antibiotic-resistant bacteria [7,8] and fungal infections [9,10] respiratory viruses likely play a significant role in childhood febrile neutropenia. febrile neutropenia was defined as a body temperature of 38.5\u00b0C on one occasion or 38.0\u00b0C on two occasions at least 60 minutes apart. an absolute neutrophil count of either 0.5109/L on one occasion or 1.0109/L with a decline to less than 0.5109/L over a subsequent 48-hour period. a follow-up sample was collected regardless of the patient\u2019s absolute neutrophil count or symptoms. if the patient had a new episode of febrile neutropenia at the time of the follow-up, this sample was considered both a follow-up sample and a new episode sample. if the patient had a new episode of febrile neutropenia at the time of the follow-up, this sample required an additional follow-up sample. Statistical analyses Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 6.0 software. p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. children aged 0\u201318 years were eligible for enrollment in this study. the NPA was diluted in approximately 2 mL of saline and immediately sent to the accredited Karolinska University Laboratory for microbiological analysis. adenovirus (HAdV); bocavirus (HBoV); coronaviruses NL63/OC43/229E/HKU1 (HCoV); enterovirus (EV); influenza virus A, including A(H1N1)pdm09 and B (Flu); parainfluenza viruses 1 the RNA was used for the nested reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR with one-step Superscript-Platinum Taq (Life Technologies, Stockholm, Sweden) for the first (outer) PCR, and Platinum Taq for the second (nested) PCR. the sequences have been deposited in GenBank under accession numbers KX15472-KX154585 for RV-A. 54 patients with 87 episodes of febrile neutropenia were analysed. the median age across all episodes was 7 years (range, 0.5\u201317.7 years), and 59% of the episodes occurred in females. the patient was undergoing treatment for a hematologic malignancy in 51% of the episodes and for a solid tumor in 49% of the episodes. 5 (0->30) 5 (0\u201313) 7 (4\u20139) 7 (6\u201310) 11 (8\u201322) 5 (2->30) 0.0001 Days with antibiotics 7 (0\u201330) 7 (0\u201313) 7 (4\u20139) 13 (9\u201317) 15 (14\u201317) 7 (0\u201330) 0.0001 0.93 Days with fever 2 (1\u201316) 2 (1\u20136) 4 (2\u20136) 3 (1\u20135) 4 (2\u201310) 2 (1\u201316) 0.08 0.91 Temperaturee 39.1 (38.0\u201340 one respiratory virus was identified in 39 (45%) of the 87 episodes. multiple viruses (range, 2\u20134 viruses) were detected in two episodes. co-presence with a respiratory virus and septicemia was detected in three episodes (3%). respiratory viruses in 39 of 87 episodes of febrile neutropenia. total respiratory viruses (n = 43) single respiratory viral infections (n = 34) Multiple respiratory viral infections (n = 6a) Co-presence of respiratory virus and septicemia. 2 0 0 Coughing, sore throat, hoarse, headache (y) 35.17 1/1 41 Runny nose, coughing (y) 27.72 1/1 31 PIV 3 2 2 0 0 Runny nose, coughing (y) 27.72 1/1 31 PIV 3 2 2 0 0 Sore throat (y), coughing (n) 35.77 1/1 23 Runny nose, coughing (y) 18.44 RSV 3 2 1 one episode with HBoV NL63 and one with HAdV, HBoV, HBoV, HBoV, HBoV, HBoV, Human coronavirus;

range, 14\u201317 days) and a longer hospitalization (median, 11 days; range, 8\u201322 days) the episodes for all except one involving RV exhibited respiratory symptoms. one (Flu) represented a new episode of febrile neutropenia. one patient was RV-positive in three follow-up samples; however sequencing revealed that two of these follow-up samples contained a new RV specie. all of the RV-C had cleared by the time of follow-up. the four persistent episodes involving RV were associated with RV-A infections. the detection rate of respiratory viruses in the control group was high (35.4%) with RV and HCoV the most commonly detected viruses in asymptomatic children. two of the infections identified at follow-up represented new species of RV from the previous infection, which increases the proportion of resolved infections to 84%. the presence of respiratory symptoms was significantly higher in the episodes involving only respiratory viral infection compared with both episodes involving only septicemia and fever of unknown origin. a majority of the respiratory viruses detected could be correlated with respiratory tract symptoms, with the exception of PIV, which was detected in asymptomatic patients. RV-A and RV-C causing both upper and lower respiratory tract infections were the most frequently detected species in another study that investigated RV infection in immunosuppressed children [31]. the severity of the disease in relation to the RV specie was difficult to evaluate. the same RV genotypes were detected from follow-up samples in four episodes. five patients positive for RV reported symptom appearance 6 days or longer before fever onset. this could indicate longer shedding times for RV, which is in line with results from studies on immunocompetent children."}
