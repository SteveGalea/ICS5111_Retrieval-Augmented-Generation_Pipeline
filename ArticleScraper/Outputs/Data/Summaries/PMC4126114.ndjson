{"summary": "study was conducted in the EOPD of a tertiary level health care institution in north india in the month of may, 2011. the data was obtained from 591 patients, who were present in the EOPD during the month of may, 2011. a patient arriving in the ED encounters repeated waits as he/she progresses in different stages. a patient arriving in the ED encounters repeated waits as he/she progresses in different stages. a patient arriving in the ED encounters repeated waits as he/she progresses. the investigator was stationed in the ED from 8.00 to 18.00 h. the data regarding arrival time and inter-arrival Gap was collected. the data was obtained from the emergency records. patients have to be brought on the trolley for a checkup in the ED. at present, four posts of SMO were lying vacant and only one was in a position. majority of the patients who visited the EOPD were male. patients showed that around 26.3% patients came during the 9.00-12.00 h. peak hour of the presentation was 10.01-11.00 with 11% of the total presentations. maximum patients (29.6%) were waiting \u201cunder observation\u201d after preliminary diagnosis by the physician and their median waiting time was 16 h. overcrowded EDs and poorly managed patient flow result in long waits for patients, increase in the risk of inappropriate care and poor quality of services. the higher use of the ED in the tertiary care hospitals can also be attributed to many reasons such as increase in illness and chronic diseases, changes in demographic and epidemiological trends of diseases. the area of ED under study was adequate only for around 29,000 yearly patient load against present 53,000. due to shortage of space, even the corridors of the EOPD were full with patients on trolleys with very little space left for movement. study found patients' arrival time pattern was highly random. the peak arrival hours were at \u201c9.00-12.00 h\u201d in which around one fourth of the patients arrived in the EOPD. the findings in the present study were in consonance with another study done in a tertiary care hospital of barbados. the volume of patients attending an ED was observed to be a major determinant of the waiting time. the resources in the department need to be matched to the workload on an hour by hour basis. the factors influencing the patient flow do not lie solely in ED. around 12.3% of patients in the EOPD were found waiting for specialized tests with the median waiting time of 12 h. in the EOPD, blood samples for laboratory test were taken by already overworked resident doctors. another study on the ED of study institute has also observed extreme rush in laboratories present within the premises of ED. the communication with patients in ED should be improved, where waiting is inevitable, health education and promotion should be introduced. a laboratory technician should be posted in EOPD area for blood sample collection to ease out the already overworked resident doctors. through this study, we tried to analyze the patient flow system by assessing the arrival and waiting time distribution of patients in the Emergency Out Patient Department. this study will inform the hospital administrators and policy makers in effectively design a system so as to reduce waiting times and hence overcrowding in ED. this will in-turn benefit the patient by increasing their satisfaction rate. the waiting times at different service stations in EOPD have been analysed. the paper provides insight to some operational factors and solutions."}
