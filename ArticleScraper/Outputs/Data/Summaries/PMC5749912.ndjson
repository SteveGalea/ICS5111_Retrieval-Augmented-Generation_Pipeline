{"summary": "surveillance was conducted in 12 sites, including 9 states and 3 jurisdictions. each site recruited HCPs that represented patients of all ages. ARI was defined as fever with cough or sore throat, and among patients 2 years ILI was defined as fever with cough or sore throat. in 11 of 12 participating laboratories, specimens were first tested for influenza viruses using the CDC human Influenza Virus RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel. the testing platform for respiratory viruses other than influenza virus was determined by the participating laboratories but required to be PCR based. five sites used virus-specific RT-PCR assays developed and shared by the CDC. 82 patients with ARI from 7 sites not systematically collecting specimens from patients with ARI and 50 patients with insufficient symptom information to define ILI or ARI. surveillance was conducted in 12 sites, including 9 states and 3 jurisdictions. patients age 2 years ILI was defined as fever, cough, sore throat, nasal congestion, or rhinorrhea. patients with ARI were analyzed as a mutually exclusive group. patients with symptom onset within 7 days of the clinic visit were included. five sites used virus-specific RT-PCR assays developed and shared by the CDC. one site tested specimens first by the Luminex xTAG RVP and then subtyped influenza A virus\u2013positive specimens by using the CDC panel. only test results from fda\u2013approved assays were reported to the submitting physician. ninety-five percent confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using bootstrap analysis. we excluded 82 patients with ARI from the 7 sites not systematically collecting specimens from patients with ARI and 50 patients with insufficient symptom information to define ILI or ARI. seasonal peak was less prominent among patients with ILI aged 1 and 50 years. the seasonal peak was difficult to discern among patients with ARI, with exception of children aged 2\u201317 years.

EV detections were high among patients age 1 year (30/1000 persons) influenza virus detections occurred in large numbers during the winter months. RV/EV detections were predominant during early fall months. inverse circulation pattern to that of influenza virus and a similarly high cumulative incidence. a study by Neuzil et al found a comparable incidence of outpatient ARIs that could be attributed to a respiratory virus of 43\u201367/1000 among adults aged 18 years. our incidence, as expected, was lower than estimates reported in much of the literature. the IISP is the first surveillance program in the country. the united states to use molecular virologic techniques to evaluate annual respiratory infection etiology and incidence. our data demonstrate the substantial burden of ARI and ILI, the contribution of specific viruses, and the usefulness of the case definition for influenza virus surveillance. the IISP presents a platform for conducting population-based surveillance coupled with systematic testing for respiratory viruses."}
