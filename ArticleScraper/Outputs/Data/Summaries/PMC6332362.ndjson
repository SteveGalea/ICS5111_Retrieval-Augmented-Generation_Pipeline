{"summary": "aptamers are synthetic oligonucleotides that fold into unique 3-D structures that specifically bind to their targets with high affinity. they can be selected against a wide variety of targets including metal ions [3,4], small molecules [5,6], proteins [7,8] and even whole cells [9,10]. monoclonal bead modified SELEX (blue) and droplet SELEX (green) both use ePCR for library amplification and high-throughput partitioning using FACS and FADS respectively. classical SELEX is sensitive to stochastic effects that influence selection process. these effects can include loss of tight binding members, retention of weak binders or random fluctuations in amplification. monoclonal beads have greatly enhanced partitioning during aptamer selection process. monoclonal microbead technology is currently capable of sorting cells and beads at rates of up to around 108 per hour. this transition from binding capture to FACS selection is a major step forward in terms of selection efficiency and efficacy. microbeads show potential in developing higher complexity enzymatic interactions by combining monoclonal encapsulation and FADS technology. functionalised bead generation methods for the generation of oligonucleotide-functionalised monoclonal beads have been pivotal in advancing aptamer selection techniques. ePCR enables multiple round monoclonal bead SELEX. ePCR is used to perform high efficiency, low error PCR. non-specific amplicons are erroneous products of PCR. ePCR efficiency is increased due to homogenous conditions within each reaction vessel. compartmentalisation of sequences prevents cross-contamination. homogenous nucleotide content within each droplet lessens amplification bias for shorter sequences. microfluidic platforms for emulsion generation typically only require a cross-junction of channels. at certain junctions droplet reagents in laminar flow can be combined into droplets at regular intervals by the constant flow of an immiscible separation liquid such as silicon oil. soft lithography involved in forming microfluidic emulsion forming devices involve the use of a clean rooms, moulds, and specialised engineers. the first use of ePCR in aptamer selection was generation of monoclonal DNA droplets for high quality oligonucleotide libraries. droplets are formed containing PCR reagents, including forward primers (Blue strands) and reverse primers (Purple Strands) and template strands (Red and Green strands) single stranded monoclonal beads are formed by alkaline denaturation and magnetic separation. on average only 10% of droplets will contain sequences with as many as 80% of nucleotide coated beads being monoclonal. ePCR enables multiple round monoclonal bead SELEX. in vitro compartmentalisation (IVC) using water in oil (W/O) emulsion technology was developed in 1998. picolitre volume aqueous droplets in an oil medium are used as miniature reaction vessels. emulsion generation can be performed either with stirrers or microfluidic devices. both methods rely on the Poisson distribution to predict and maximise the proportion of droplets that contain exactly one sequence as a function of sequence concentration. high polydispersity can cause differences in activity between different droplets. microfluidic devices are typically made of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) soft lithography involved in forming microfluidic emulsion forming devices involve the use of a clean rooms, moulds, and specialised engineers. this process is more specialised than stirrer emulsion generation methods due to additional equipment and expertise required for the microfluidic droplet setup. ePCR was used to form monoclonal beads that bind to proteins and cellular targets in the partitioning stage. ePCR

alkaline denaturation and magnetic separation. on average only 10% of droplets will contain sequences with as many as 80% of nucleotide coated beads being monoclonal [18] monoclonal beads are excited with a laser and fluorescent emission intensities quantified. monoclonal beads are excited with a laser and their fluorescent emission intensities quantified. ePCR and transcription results in monoclonal droplets before addition of reaction reagents. yeast display is a technique where a library of antibodies is displayed on yeast cell surfaces by expression of an antibody and yeast surface fusion protein (Aga2p) using this technique, the power of FACS could be utilised for aptamer selection for the first time. single round selection is a major drawback for FACS based selection techniques. pre-enriched libraries were amplified using ePCR to create a monoclonal bead library. this library was then incubated with biotinylated target, washed and briefly incubated with streptavidin-phycoerythrin dye. the top 0.1% of monoclonal beads was selected and PCR was used to recover the selected oligonucleotide aptamers from the beads. monoclonal bead library of aptamers was made based on a previously selected aptamer containing a random base-binding pocket. two complementary sequences targeting adjacent sequence positions were synthesised: one with a conjugated fluorophore and one with a conjugated quencher. the monoclonal beads can then be sorted based on this fluorescent signal using FACS. agarose bead library could then be incubated with a fluorescently labelled target. oligonucleotides are not covalently linked to the bead, so dissociation can occur over time. cells have also been used as a medium for oligonucleotide selection using FACS. e and any cells containing fluorophore activating RNA aptamers were selected using FACS. the new Broccoli aptamers showed 2-fold higher fluorescence when expressed in E. coli and compared to the original Spinach aptamers. selection is limited to RNA-based aptamers. the microfluidics provide an efficient way to generate monodisperse emulsion droplets. the microfluidics provide an efficient way to generate monodisperse emulsion droplets. this allows for greater manipulation of both the droplet contents and droplet size to the femtolitre scale. selection of oligonucleotides within compartmentalised droplets has been achieved for ribozymes of varying functions. but the polydispersity of droplets in these methods has limited selection efficacy. in previous experiments, the procedure relied on the self-modification of the RNA library. fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) is a technique used to rapidly sort cells or beads based on their fluorescent intensity or surface morphology. each droplet-encapsulated cell is classed based on predefined sort gates. monoclonal beads are excited with a laser and their fluorescent emission intensities quantified. FACS was invented in the late 1960s by Bonner, Sweet, Hulett and Herzenberg. over the next 40 years, FACS has been continuously developed and can now monitor up to 12 distinct fluorescent signals with sort speeds of up to 100,000 events per second. single round selection is a drawback for FACS based selection techniques. aptamers were isolated against the four targets thrombin, ApoE, PAI-1, and 4-1BB. aptamers were isolated against the four targets thrombin, ApoE and thrombin. aptamers isolated using this FACS selection had 1000 times stronger binding than aptamers isolated against the same targets using traditional SELEX [18] aptamers with tight binding dissociation constants of 2.32 nM and 339 pM were characterised respectively. aptamers with tight binding dissociation constants of 2.32 nM and 339 pM were characterised respectively. aptamers with tight binding dissociation constants of 2.32 nM and 3 agarose beads containing PCR reagents and precursor DNA aptamer templates were first developed. monoclonal beads containing DNA aptamer libraries had to be first developed. oligonucleotides are not covalently linked to the bead and so dissociation can occur over time. early research into fluorescent aptamers isolated RNA aptamers against the Spinach fluorophore using classical binding/capture selection. the spinach fluorophore has no fluorescence in its native state but when a ligand binds and stabilises the structure, a strong fluorescent signal is produced. a selection system within bacterial cells was conducted to optimise the resulting RNA aptamers. single species per bead oligonucleotide libraries were created by solid phase synthesis. inability to amplify these synthesised aptamer-on-bead libraries meant only one round of selection could take place. single round selection is a drawback for FACS based selection techniques. the top 0.1% of monoclonal beads was selected. PCR was used to recover the selected oligonucleotide aptamers from the beads. aptamers were isolated against the four targets thrombin, ApoE, PAI-1, and 4-1BB. monoclonal beads containing DNA aptamer libraries had to be first developed. agarose beads containing PCR reagents and precursor DNA aptamer templates were created using microfluidic generated water-in-oil emulsion. agarose beads containing PCR reagents and precursor DNA aptamer templates were then cooled to form solid agarose beads. agarose beads are not covalently linked to the bead, so dissociation can occur over time. cells have also been used as a medium for oligonucleotide selection using FACS. early research into fluorescent aptamers isolated RNA aptamers against the Spinach fluorophore using classical binding/capture selection. fluorescence-activated droplet sorting (FADS) is a method of sorting emulsion droplets similar to FACS. enzymatic activity can be used as a sorting criterion. many advances have been made in the field. FADS utilises a microfluidic system to sort emulsion droplets based on fluorescence intensities. droplets can be sorted according to presence or absence of enzymatic activity with the incorporation of fluorogenic substrates. emulsion droplets of defined fluorescence intensity are deflected to the designated collection tube by dielectrophoresis. ribozyme mutants were compartmentalised into monodisperse droplets along with fluorogenic substrates. the selected ribozyme variant exhibited a 28-times greater activity than the original ribozyme. the selection process is based on intramolecular reactions in single turnover conditions. IVC and FADS Within a single droplet, a range of in vitro reactions are possible such as transcription/translation, the expression of functional enzymes and bacterial synthesis of enzyme libraries. enzymatic-based selection is more experimentally challenging in both FACS and FADS. enzymatic activity-based sorting can be achieved at an impressive 30 kHz rate [82] for such enzymatic activity-based sorting applications, FADS eliminates the need to prepare cells and isolate them from aerosols produced in FACS sorting [84]. this has given insight into the use of FADS to select catalytic oligonucleotides instead of simple binding aptamers. the selected ribozyme variant exhibited a 28-times greater activity than the original ribozyme. oligonucleotide-modified beads can be encapsulated inside microfluidic droplets. the combination of monoclonal beads and FACS has led to robust aptamer selection techniques. library method resulted in a 1.7 109 fold enrichment of an aptamer population within a single round. this is 100 million times better than the 10-fold enrichment typically observed for a classical SELEX round. aptamer beads are practical for most aptamer selection applications."}
