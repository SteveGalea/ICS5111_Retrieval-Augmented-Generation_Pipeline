{"summary": "HBoV prevalence in africa was 13% in individuals suffering gastroenteritis with/without respiratory tract infection. prevalence in africa was 13% in individuals suffering gastroenteritis with/without respiratory tract infection. HBoV is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide. rotavirus, norovirus, astrovirus, and adenovirus that cause diarrhea have been reported worldwide. the number of viral agents associated with diarrheal disease in humans has increased progressively. HBoV is a viral agent that has been reported worldwide in various studies as a potential cause of diarrhea outbreaks. primary infection with HBoV occurs early in life in children between 6\u201324 months of age [32\u201334], but older children and adults can also be infected [28, 35]. there is no specific approved treatment or vaccine for HBoV infection [25, 36, 37]. since its discovery, the virus was mainly associated with respiratory tract infections. the first search was performed for HBoV + Africa, the second was HBoV + other developing countries, and the third was HBoV + worldwide. Keywords used included human Bocavirus, Bocavirus, and human parvovirus combined for each. to avoid leaving out any studies not found in major scientific databases, Google search was also used. results and Discussion Between 2005 and 2016 a total of 756 studies were published in africa, other developing countries and worldwide. from these studies, 70 studies met the inclusion criteria of which 11 studies were from African countries and 59 studies combined were for other developing countries and worldwide. piratory tract infection PCR 1 [41] - Peri-urban All children 641 101 (16%) - - Stool Diarrhea PCR 1,2,3,4 [74] 2007-2008 2-11 years children 149 7 (5%) - 149 Throat, Nasal Respiratory tract infection Real-time PCR 1 [66] Argentina 2011 Peri-urban 2 years children 222 15 (7%) 222 - Nasal Respiratory tract infection PCR 1 [76] Argentina s 90 2 (2%) 90 - Stool Diarrhea PCR 1 [84] Cambodia 2009-2010 Urban All Children/adults 292 162 (55%) 292 - Nasal, throat Respiratory tract infection Multiplex PCR 1 [85] cameroon 2011-2013 Urban 15 years children 347 37 (11%) 347 - Throat Respiratory tract infection Multiplex PCR 1 [86] china 2009-2013 Urban/rural All Children/adults 292 95 - Nasal Respiratory tract infection Real-time PCR 1 [8] 2013-2015 Urban 1 month-2 years children 100 2(2%) 100 - Stool Diarrhea PCR 1 [95] Finland 2000-2002 Urban 3 months-15 years children 117 24 (49%) 117 - Nasal, serum Respiratory tract infection Qualitative PCR 1 [96] 2010 Urban All Children/adults 250 4 (1.6%) 250 - Stool Diarrhea Multiplex real- all children/adults 355 4.5%, 355 - Nasal Respiratory tract infection PCR 1 [30] 2004-2007 Urban/rural 14 years children 415 34 (8.2%) 415 - Nasal Respiratory tract infection PCR 1 [104] 2011-2012 Urban All Children/adults 689 14 (2%) 689 - Stool Diarrhea Real time PCR 1 [105] india 2010-2011 Rural/Peri-urban 0\u20136 years children 300 2 ( 1 - Nasal Respiratory tract infection PCR 1 [111] Netherland 2005-2006 Peri-urban 3 months-6 years children 257 4 (1.6%) - 257 Nasal Respiratory infection/diarrhea Real time PCR 1 [112] Pakistan 2008 Rural - Children/adults 98 - - - Stool Diarrhea PCR 1,2 [113] Philippines 2008-2009 Urban 8 days to 13 years children 1242 2 (0.16%) 12 Nasal, stool Respiratory tract infection real-time PCR 1 [42] Taiwan 2008-2009 Peri-urban 5 months-9 years children 705 35 (5%) - 705 Throat Respiratory tract infection PCR 1 [119] Thailand 2006 Urban 1 month-9 years children 252 18 (7%) 252 - Nasal Respiratory tract infection PCR 1 [20] 2005-2007 Peri-urban 2 months-5 years children 427 2 (0.4%) 225 202 Stool Diarrhe urban 6 years children 346 60 (17.34%) 346 - Stool Diarrhea PCR 1,2 [94] india 2010-2011 Rural/Peri-urban 0\u20136 years children 300 2 (0.6 %) 300 - Throat swabs Respiratory tract infection PCR 1 [106] Jordan 2003-2004 Urban 5 years children 326 57 (17%) 326 - Nasal Respiratory tract infection Real time PCR 1 [108] Philippines 2008-2009 Urban 8 days infection Real-Time PCR 1 [115] south africa 1998-2000 Urban 2 children 1460 174 (22.8%) 1460 - Nasal Respiratory tract infection RT-PCR 1 [116] 2004 Urban 2 days\u201312 years children 341 38 (11%) 341 - Nasal Respiratory tract infection PCR 1 [54] 2004-2005 Urban 2 months to 6 years children 242 18 (7.4%) 242 - Nasal Respiratory tract infection Nested PCR 1 [117] 2009- analysis was done to provide transparent, objective, and replicable summaries of the study findings. from all the 70 studies, 66 had sufficient information to enable statistical analysis. none of the other drivers (including age, setting, symptoms, method of detection, and hospitalization) achieved statistical significance. more studies reported HBoV in children less than five years of age (54%; 6/11) compared to children above the age of 5 and adults 45% (5/11) countries that reported on HBoV in africa included Kenya 18% (2/11), south africa 36% (4/11), Egypt 18% (2/11), Cameroon 9% (1/11), and Senegal 18% (2/11) in children less than five years of age was high, 54% (6/11) compared to children above 5 years of age and adults 45% (5/11) severe infections requiring hospitalization occur primarily in patients with an underlying disease and children under 5 years of age. studies in africa (13%; 9/70) mostly done in urban setting compared to other developing countries/worldwide (87%; 61/70) several studies have isolated HBoV from children with respiratory tract infection worldwide. the prevalence of HBoV in these children was 1.5%\u201319%. most studies focused on HBoV in respiratory tract infection since its discovery in 2005."}
