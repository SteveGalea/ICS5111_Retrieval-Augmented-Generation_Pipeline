{"summary": "bats are likely reservoirs for a range of zoonotic viruses, such as rabies and other lyssaviruses (family Rhabdoviridae), Ebola- and Marburg viruses (Filoviridae), Hendra- and Nipah viruses (Paramyxoviridae) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus (Coronaviridae) in 2009/10, influenza A expanded the list of viral pathogens found in bat samples were exported under a state contract between the Republic of Ghana and the Federal Republic of Germany. a further export permission was obtained from the Veterinary Services of the Ghana Ministry of Food and Agriculture. rabbit antisera homologous to the antigens used (Table 1). Printed slides were stored in a desiccation chamber until further use. a 13 H5.02 H5N1 A/duck/NY/191255-59/2002. we inactivated all bat sera in a water bath at 56\u00b0C for one hour. ahighly pathogenic blow pathogenic Prior to analysis, we inactivated all bat sera in a water bath. dilutions were incubated for one hour in a moist, dark box at 37\u00b0C. antibody binding was detected using an unconjugated goat-anti-bat whole immunoglobulin G (IgG) at a dilution of 1:800. both conjugates were titrated to determine the optimal working concentration. each incubation period followed three washing steps using wash buffer. all animals used in this study were captured and sampled with permission from the Wildlife Division, Forestry Commission, Accra, Ghana. the samples were exported under a state contract between the Republic of Ghana and the Federal Republic of Germany. Printed slides were stored in a desiccation chamber until further use. a 13 H5.02 H5N1 A/duck/NY/191255-59/2002. ahighly pathogenic blow pathogenic prior to analysis, we inactivated all bat sera in a water bath at 56\u00b0C for one hour. proteins were obtained from Immune Technology Corp. (NY, USA) or Sino Biological Inc. (Beijing, China) dilutions were incubated for one hour in a moist, dark box at 37\u00b0C. antibody binding was detected using an unconjugated goat-anti-bat whole immunoglobulin G (IgG) at a dilution of 1:800. each incubation period followed three washing steps using wash buffer. 67 (67%) were negative against all antigens. 33 bats showed titers against one or more antigens. thereof, 21 (21%) bats showed antibody titers higher than 40 against at least one H9-antigen. reactivity to single proteins was observed for H3 (n = 1), H5 (n = 1) and H8 (n = 1, titer: 42) no significant differences in seropositivity between sexes, age groups, sampling season and\u2014season. influenza virus RNA was detected in a low percentage (0.9%) of the Guatemalan (3/316) and Peruvian (1/110) bats by pan-influenza conventional RT-PCR. molecular detection is limited by a short duration of virus excretion making it impossible to exclude virus presence on population level. serological tests are limited in their specificity due to the existence of cross reactive antibodies. limited surveillance in birds allow unnoticed reassortment events between circulating avian or potentially human influenza virus strains. serological evidence of influenza A viruses in bats has been shown to be biologically relevant reservoirs of pathogenic viruses such as Henipaviruses, Coronaviruses and Lyssaviruses."}
