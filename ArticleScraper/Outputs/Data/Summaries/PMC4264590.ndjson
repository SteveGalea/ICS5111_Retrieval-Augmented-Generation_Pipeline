{"summary": "systematic review conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. study population of interest was human subjects of any age or sex. intervention of interest was convalescent plasma, serum, or hyperimmune immunoglobulin. the cochrane collaboration tool was used for experimental and prospective cohort studies [12], the Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used for observational studies (excluding prospective cohort studies) records limited to abstracts were not assessed, because of the paucity of information contained therein. search strategy and study selection Two reviewers executed the search strategy in July 2013. Adaptations were made for search interfaces that did not allow use of complex constructs. all search records were imported to EndNote X5 software. analyses were stratified by viral etiology for each research question. results were adjusted by adding 0.5 to each cell of the contingency table. results were adjusted by adding 0.5 to each cell of the contingency table. 13 observational studies that met our protocol eligibility criteria were published between 2003 and 2011. four studies reported outcomes for 29 patients infected with avian influenza A(H5N1) [23, 26, 27, 36], 4 studies reported outcomes for 104 patients infected with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 [24, 30, 37, 48], and 8 studies reported outcomes for 214 patients with SARS [8, 25, 28, 29, 31, 32, 45, 46]. risk of bias within studies Two systematic reviews were at low risk of bias [7, 21], whereas one was at moderate to low risk of bias across most domains (Table 1) [22]. data extraction was judged to be a moderate source of bias in all systematic reviews. the majority of studies lacked a comparator group, and 28 studies were at moderate to high risk of bias. three studies were not assessed for risk of bias, because they presented insufficient data [17, 29, 45]. four noncomparative studies found that the CFR varied from 0% (0/1) to 12.5% (10/80) the likelihood of discharge by day 22 was 54% greater (95% CI, 24.8%\u201384.6%) after treatment. no comparative data were reported. no data were reported in identified studies. significantly lower viral load after treatment was observed at days 3, 5, and 7 after ICU admission. all studies reported use of convalescent plasma, except 11 studies, in which convalescent serum was used to treat Spanish influenza A(H1N1) infection. a retrospective case-comparison study showed a CFR reduction after plasma treatment that reached statistical significance. a subgroup analysis of 48 patients found that receipt of convalescent plasma treatment 14 days after onset of symptoms improved the likelihood of discharge within 22 days of admission. this remained significant after adjustment for age, viral status, time of administration, and lactate dehydrogenase level. allocation of treatment was mostly based on the physician's decision and the availability of plasma, and this study was at high risk of bias. 2 of 26 patients receiving convalescent plasma reported a nonsignificant absolute reduction of 70% (95% CI, 52%\u201389%; P =.11) in the CFR. three case reports reported recovery among patients treated with convalescent plasma. the remaining studies observed a CFR ranging from 0% (0 of 2) to 48% (12 of 25) after treatment. the majority of studies on Spanish influenza A(H1N1) infection were found to have high risk of bias due to the use of now archaic research methods. convalescent plasma treatment was associated with a significant increase in the proportion of SARS-CoV\u2013infected patients discharged within 22 days of admission in 1 center (absolute difference, 54%; 95% CI, 25%\u201385%; P =.004) both studies at moderate to high risk of bias and confounding by indication. a case report of a patient with avian influenza A(H5N1)pdm09 infection also found that virus-specific antibodies appeared 7\u201316 days following convalescent plasma treatment. a case report of a patient with avian influenza A(H5N1)pdm09 infection also found that virus-specific antibodies appeared 7\u201316 days following convalescent plasma treatment. two observational studies [8, 46] concerned with SARS-CoV infection reported that treatments did not cause harm when administered to patients. three studies from 1918\u20131920 (involving 101\u2013157 patients with influenza) reported minor infusion complications, including chills, increased temperature [34, 44], and sweats [33]. 13 observational studies published between 1918 and 1920 studied 980 patients who received a clinical diagnosis of influenza-associated pneumonia or Spanish influenza A (H1N1) infection. it is unclear whether some of these studies recruited patients with secondary bacterial pneumonia. four studies reported outcomes for 29 patients infected with avian influenza A(H5N1) [23, 26, 27, 36], 4 studies reported outcomes for 104 patients infected with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 [24, 30, 37, 48], and the lack of randomized treatment allocation may have introduced systematic error, and the viral load outcome was at high risk of bias because of incomplete follow-up of patients. the lack of randomized treatment allocation may have introduced systematic error. al studies reported outcomes that were either moderate risk (11 outcomes) or moderate to high risk of selection bias (33 outcomes) the majority of studies lacked a comparator group, and 28 studies were at high or very high risk of reporting bias. a decrease in viral load was reported after treatment in 1 study. no adverse events or complications were reported after treatment. no comparative data were reported in identified studies. the length of hospital stay was 94 d in a case report at high risk of bias. no comparative data were reported. a retrospective case-comparison study showed a CFR reduction after plasma treatment that reached statistical significance. a subgroup analysis of 30 patients found that those treated when PCR-positive but seronegative for SARS-CoV were more likely to be discharged within 22 days of admission. influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 Infection Four observational studies [24, 30, 37, 48] and 1 systematic review [22] reported data on severe cases of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection treated with convalescent plasma. patients received a single 500-mL dose of convalescent plasma with a neutralizing antibody titer of >1:160. treatment with convalescent plasma, serum, or blood was associated with a significant absolute reduction of 21% (95% CI, 15%\u201327%) in the pooled CFR. Statistical heterogeneity was low (I2 = 29.3%), although interventions were clinically heterogeneous. only 2 studies of convalescent serum reported a comparator group. post hoc meta-analysis evaluated pooled data from 8 comparative studies. 2 studies of SARS-CoV infection [32, 46], 2 of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection [30, 48], 1 of avian influenza A(H5N1) infection [36], and 3 of Spanish influenza A(H1N1) infection [33, 38, 47]. retrospective case-comparison study showed a CFR reduction after plasma treatment that reached statistical significance (absolute reduction in CFR, 23%; 95% CI, 6%\u201342%; P =.049) a second study with a comparator group described a cluster of 29 cases of SARS-CoV infection in which 1 patient received convalescent plasma and survived. patients received a single 500-mL dose of convalescent plasma with a neutralizing antibody titer of >1:160. multivariable analysis also showed a significant reduction in the relative risk of mortality. both groups received other treatments, such as neuraminidase inhibitors and steroids. plasma, serum, or blood was associated with a significant absolute reduction of 21% (95% CI, 15%\u201327%) in the pooled CFR. 2 studies of convalescent whole blood reported use of convalescent whole blood. there was a statistically significance lower risk of mortality in the group treated with convalescent plasma or serum (pooled OR, 0.25; 95% CI,.14 to.45; P.001; I2 = 0%; Figure 3). Sensitivity analyses that excluded studies with 5 cases demonstrated little variation in the pooled OR or change in statistical heterogeneity. both studies were at moderate to high risk of bias and confounding by indication. case-comparison study at moderate risk of bias reported no significant difference in length of hospital stay between treatment and control patients who required ECMO. virus became undetectable 2\u20133 days after initiation of convalescent plasma treatment for 2 cases and 7\u201316 days after treatment initiation for the third case. three studies from 1918\u20131920 (involving 101\u2013157 patients with influenza) reported minor infusion complications, including chills, increased temperature [34, 44], and sweats [33]. post hoc pooled meta-analysis across all viral etiologies showed a statistically significant 75% reduction in the odds of mortality among those who were treated with convalescent plasma or serum. of interest is the evidence for a survival benefit after early administration. we cannot be assured that all Spanish influenza A(H1N1) infection studies were included. the theoretical rationale for pooling mortality data from different viral etiologies remains to be fully established. the results obtained must be considered experimental and interpreted with an appropriate level of caution. ing infection consortium are developing a clinical trial protocol to investigate the effectiveness of passive immunotherapy for critically ill patients with SARI. the results obtained must be considered experimental and interpreted with an appropriate level of caution. convalescent plasma should only be administered in acute centers able to manage potential treatment-related complications, such as transfusion-related acute lung injury. this would help clarify the potential benefits and harms of treatment, identify optimal dosage, and ascertain whether repeated treatments are relevant factors for clinical practice.
