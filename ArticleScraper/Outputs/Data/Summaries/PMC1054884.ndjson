{"summary": "recombination events have been shown to be associated with viruses expanding host range [4,5,6,7] or increasing their virulence [8,9], thus accompanying, or perhaps even being at the origin of, major changes during virus adaptation. it remains unclear whether recombination events represent a highly frequent and significant phenomenon in the everyday life of these viruses. no quantitative PCR or other quantitative method has been applied to evaluate the number of recombinants appearing in an experimentally infected live host. so far, no quantitative method has been applied to evaluate the number of recombinants appearing in an experimentally infected live host. the caMV genome is a circular double-stranded DNA of 8,024 bp. the protein P5 reverse-transcribes the genome into genomic DNA that is concomitantly encapsidated. the latter revealed inter-genomic viral recombination, but the latter demonstrated that CaMV can also recombine with transgenes within the host's genome. indirect experimental evidence has indicated that, in some cases, CaMV recombination could occur within the host nucleus, between different viral minichromosomes, presumably through the action of the DNA repair cellular machinery. recombination is an exceptional event or an \u201ceveryday\u201d process shaping the genetic composition of CaMV populations. we have constructed a CaMV genome with four genetic markers, demonstrated to be neutral in competition experiments. the recombinant genomes averaged over 50% of the population. the proportions of recombinants from the seven classes were added to estimate the total percentage of recombinant genomes within each tested plant. the proportion of recombinant genomes found in the mixed viral populations was astonishingly high and very similar in the ten plants analyzed. recombination events are very frequent during the invasion of the host plant by CaMV. i 12, interference between crossovers in segments a\u2013b and b\u2013c; i 23, interference between crossovers in segments a\u2013b and c\u2013d; i 13, interference between crossovers in segments a\u2013b and c\u2013d; i 13, second-order interference accounting for residual interference. the recombination rates are the maximum likelihood estimates ( 95% confidence intervals) the proportions of recombinants from the seven classes were added to estimate the total percentage of recombinant genomes within each tested plant. the proportion of recombinant genomes found in the mixed viral populations was astonishingly high and very similar in the ten co-infected plants analyzed. r 1, r 2, recombination rate between markers a and b; r 3, recombination rate between markers c and d; i 12, interference between crossovers in segments a\u2013b and b\u2013c; i 23, interference between crossovers in segments b\u2013c and c\u2013d; i 13, interference between crossovers in segments a\u2013b and c\u2013d; i 13, interference between crossovers in segments a\u2013b and c\u2013d; previous studies on viral recombination suffered from major drawbacks in this regard. the first two methods either do not provide information on the frequency of recombination, but only its occurrence. results from cell cultures impose cell co-infection by different viral variants, potentially overestimating the frequency of recombination events. cloned genomes may not have been through successive replication events. a recombination event between two loci apparently increases the probability of recombination between another pair of loci. in the latter, recombination is undetectable; in the latter, recombination is very frequent. if a proportion F of the population reproduces clonally, analogous to single infections, negative interferences could be inferred even if they do not exist. for example, assuming a three-locus model with real recombination rates r 1 and r 2 and interference i 12, the \u201capparent\u201d recombination parameters, would be r 1 = (1 F)r1, r 2 = (1 F)r 2 and i 12 = (F i 12 we have no information on putative hot spots at positions corresponding to the 5\u2032 end of the 35S RNA and to 1 (at nucleotide position 0) the putative hot spots fall between marker pairs c\u2013d, b\u2013c, and a\u2013b, respectively. the viral recombination rate has never previously been quantified experimentally for a plant virus. hepadnaviruses infect hosts that are very different from plants in their biology and physiology. this could lead to a totally different frequency of cell co-infection during the development of the virus populations. however, they should not be extrapolated to vertebrate pararetroviruses without caution. plasmids pCa37 and pMark-S were mechanically inoculated into plants as previously described. plantlets were co-infected by mechanical inoculation of two to three leaves with 20 l of this virus solution. the viral DNA was purified from 200 mg of young newly formed infected leaves according to the protocol described previously. aliquots of viral DNA preparations were digested by restriction enzymes corresponding to marker a, b, c, or d. each restriction enzyme cut once in Cabb-S DNA and twice in Mark-S, thus generating DNA fragments of different sizes attributable to one or the other in the mixed population of CaMV genomes. we used two datasets to test the neutrality of markers. both were derived from plants co-infected with a 1:1 ratio of Mark-S and Cabb-S. the second consisted of the restriction of 50 individual full-genome-length viral clones. the results clearly show that the markers do not have large effects, if any, and therefore recombination estimates would be affected only very slightly by any hypothetical selective effects of the markers. recombination estimates would be affected only very slightly by any hypothetical selective effects of the markers. the reverse transcription starts and finishes at the position 0 in Figure 1, which is the point of circularization of the DNA genome. this implies that changes between contiguous markers a\u2013b, b\u2013c, and c\u2013d can be considered as true recombination. those between a and d cannot, as they may simply stem from circularization of DNA. recombination distributions for two, three, and four loci are not affected by the number of loci considered. it is important to realize that given the definitions of these parameters, the estimator of the recombination rate between two loci is not affected by the number of loci considered. we obtained the same estimation of the recombination rate between markers a and b. all markers, each corresponding to a single nucleotide change, were introduced by PCR-directed mutagenesis in pCa37. this resulted in the duplication of previously unique restriction sites BsiWI, PstI, MluI, and SacI in a plasmid designated pMark-S. aliquots of viral DNA preparations were digested by restriction enzymes corresponding to marker a, b, c, or d. each individual restriction enzyme cut once in Cabb-S DNA and twice in Mark-S, thus generating DNA fragments of different sizes attributable to one or the other. in each of the ten viral populations analyzed, 50 full-genome-length clones were digested separately by BsiWI, PstI, MluI, and SacI, to test for the presence of marker a, b, c, and d. clones with none or all four markers were parental genotypes, whereas clones harboring 1, 2, or 3 markers were clearly recombinants. in all cases p-values were larger than 0.05. in all cases we found an excess of markers. the two datasets cannot be regarded as independent because the methods through which the frequency estimates were obtained were different. our aim was to analyze viral recombination in a live host. based on the kinetics of gene expression, we postulate that each replication cycle lasts between 2 and 3 d. we assumed that recombination occurred through a template-switching mechanism. the recombination parameters are the recombination rates between two adjacent loci, e.g., r 1 for the recombination rate between markers a and b, and the interference coefficients, e.g., i 12 for interference between recombination events in the segments between markers a and b and c. it proved impossible to carry out the calculations for four loci algebraically. plasmid pCa37 was cloned into the pBR322 plasmid at the unique SalI restriction site. all markers were introduced within coding regions corresponding to open reading frames I, IV, V, and VI. recombination rates were equal to the second decimal to those estimated algebraically. plants were co-infected by mechanical inoculation of two to three leaves with 20 l of this virus solution. the mixed CaMV population was allowed to grow during 21 d of systemic infection. the viral DNA was purified from 200 mg of young newly formed infected leaves. each individual restriction enzyme cut once in Cabb-S DNA and twice in Mark-S, thus generating DNA fragments of different sizes attributable to one or the other in the mixed populations of CaMV genomes. aliquots from ten of the 24 viral DNA preparations described above were digested by the restriction enzyme SalI, and directly cloned into pUC19. the first consisted of viral DNA densitometry data derived from 24 plants. for each plant we have an estimate of the frequency of each marker in the genome population. the second consisted of the restriction of 50 individual full-genome-length viral clones obtained from one plant. this was repeated on ten different plants. the results show that the markers do not have large effects, if any, and that therefore recombination estimates would be affected only very slightly by any hypothetical selective effects of the markers. we assumed that recombination occurred through a template-switching mechanism, and that therefore, from a recombination point of view, the CaMV genome is linear. to estimate the recombination rate between markers, we wrote recurrence equations describing the change in frequency of each genotype over one generation. we then expressed the frequency of all possible genotypes n generations later as a function of their initial frequency and their asymptotic variances. rate between two loci is not affected by the number of loci considered. we obtain the same estimation of the recombination rate between markers a and b. information on additional loci only affects the estimates of interference coefficients."}
