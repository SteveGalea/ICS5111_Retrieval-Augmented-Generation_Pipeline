{"summary": "surfactant is composed of 90% lipid and 10% protein. the lipid content contains primarily phospholipid, specifically dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, responsible for the biophysical function of surfactant. the hydrophobic surfactant proteins, SP-B and SP-C, are stored and secreted along with surfactant phospholipids (13, 14) this in part is responsible for the role collectins play in innate and adaptive immunity. the role of SP-B is uncertain, but its high degree of conservation suggests an integral function (17) surfactant protein (SP)-A, SP-B, and SP-D are synthesized in club cells in terminal bronchioles. the main functions of surfactant are: (1) lowering surface tension at the air\u2013liquid interface and thus preventing alveolar collapse at end-expiration. this critical function is achieved through its maintenance of a film highly enriched in DPPC. in humans there exist two genes, SP-A1 and SP-A2, that encode for SP-A1 and SP-A2 proteins. this suggests a possibility that there may be human subpopulations with differential vulnerabilities to microbial infection based on these SP-A isoforms. SP-A can inhibit dendritic cell maturation (33) and inhibit eosinophil release of IL-8 (34). surfactant is composed of 90% lipid and 10% protein. lipid content contains primarily phospholipid, specifically dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine. surfactant contains four associated proteins, surfactant protein (SP)-A, SP-B, SP-C, and SP-D. surfactant components are synthesized primarily by the alveolar type II cell. the airway club cell synthesizes surfactant proteins SP-A, SP-B, and SP-D. most of the surfactant components are stored in the lamellar bodies. surfactant is achieved through its maintenance of a film highly enriched in DPPC. this produces extremely low surface tension (1 mN/m) on compression (17) this critical function of surfactant is achieved through its maintenance of a film highly enriched in DPPC. studies have shown that SP-A and SP-D inhibit allergen-induced lymphocyte proliferation via multiple mechanisms. this effect is blunted in activated lymphocytes from children with asthma (35). pulmonary infections alter surfactant metabolism. surfactant proteins leak into the vascular space when alveolocapillary membranes are injured. circulating surfactant protein levels can be used as an indicator of lung injury and poor outcomes in H1N1 viral infections. ARDS = acute respiratory distress syndrome; N/A = not available; PAP = pulmonary alveolar proteinosis; RDS = respiratory distress syndrome. genetic polymorphisms of surfactant proteins are known to be associated with a higher prevalence of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (49, 50) but also a reduced prevalence of interstitial lung disease in systemic sclerosis (51) ncytial virus-infected bronchial epithelial cells have decreased SP-A protein levels through reduced mRNA translation efficiency. hydrophilic proteins SP-A and SP-D play a major role in host defense by inhibiting bacterial growth, facilitating bacterial uptake by host cells, and aggregating and opsonizing pathogens. the binding of pulmonary collectins to Candida albicans inhibits phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages while still inhibiting the fungal growth. hemagglutinin of pandemic influenza viruses has a low binding activity for surfactant protein D compared with that of a seasonal influenza strain (91). both synthetic and natural types of surfactant are effective. but natural preparations that retain surfactant protein B and C analogs have been shown to be superior in terms of decreasing mortality and lowering the rate of RDS complications in preterm infants. ARDS is a heterogeneous syndrome with various degrees of inflammation and tissue remodeling depending on the individual patient. exogenous surfactant also has been examined in a variety of lung diseases such as asthma and pneumonia (116). a pilot study for aerosolized natural surfactant showed improved lung function during an acute asthma exacerbation (117), it did not show clinical benefit in patients with stable asthma (118). corticosteroids have been widely used in women at risk for preterm delivery. they reduce neonatal morbidity and mortality from RDS. antinatal steroids accelerate development of type 2 pneumocytes. corticosteroids also induce pulmonary -receptors. pulmonary collectins (SP-A and SP-D) increase the permeability of the cell membrane of H. capsulatum, inhibiting its growth directly. they also bind to A. fumigatus (79), Blastomyces dermatitidis (80), Coccidioides posadasii (81), Cryptococcus neoformans (82, 83), and Pneumocystis jiroveci (84, the hemagglutinin of pandemic influenza viruses has a low binding activity for surfactant protein D compared with that of a seasonal influenza strain (91). hemagglutinin of pandemic influenza viruses has a low binding activity for surfactant protein D compared with that of a seasonal influenza strain (91). studies did not show a significant mortality benefit or a consistent improvement in oxygenation with this approach. despite the theoretical soundness of exogenous surfactant administration in patients with ARDS, this therapeutic option has limited justification at this time. one RCT of a 2-week treatment course with aerosolized synthetic surfactant showed improved pulmonary function in adult patients with stable chronic bronchitis (123). animal studies and limited human data show that exogenous surfactant decreases cytokine release (124), DNA synthesis of inflammatory mediators (125, 126), lymphocyte proliferation (127), immunoglobulin production (128), and expression of adhesion molecules (129). ecdotally reported to successfully treat children with SP-C deficiency. mechanism of action is unclear, but may be related to hydroxychloroquine\u2019s inhibition of the intracellular processing of SP-C precursors leading to late accumulation of SP-C. other agents such as keratinocyte growth factor have been shown to increase surfactant secretion or its synthesis (139)."}
