{"summary": "many probiotic bacteria have been described as promising tools for the treatment and prevention of inflammatory bowel diseases. most of these bacteria are lactic acid bacteria, which are part of the healthy human microbiota. but little is known about the effects of transient bacteria present in normal diets, including Lactococcus lactis. infiltrating T lymphocytes responsive to the gut microbiota are associated with a loss of tolerance in the intestinal mucosa. current IBD treatments include anti-inflammatory drugs, which induce or maintain remission, but are not curative. probiotics with anti-inflammatory properties have been proposed as tools for both the prevention and treatment of IBD. orally administered L. lactis FC reduced inflammatory cytokine production as well as inducible nitric oxide expression in dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice. this suggests that orally administered L. lactis FC may have a beneficial impact in human IBD [22]. oral administration of L. lactis NCDO 2118 improved colon shortening and macroscopic score of colitis. results suggest that oral administration of this strain improved colon shortening and macroscopic score of colitis. bars are the mean of 6 mice/group, and the data are representative of three independent experiments. the ability of L. lactis NCDO 2118 to prevent colonic damage was evaluated at the histological level. oral administration of L. lactis NCDO 2118 maintained sIgA production at intermediate levels. sIgA levels were increased only after the second colitis cycle. sIgA levels were increased only after the second colitis cycle. IL-17 levels were reduced at day 21 in both the DSS and DSS + NCDO2118 groups. the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was significantly decreased in the DSS-treated group but not in the NCDO 2118-treated group at day 21. the population of CD4+CD25+CD45RBlow regulatory T cells was not affected by DSS or DSS-NCDO2118 treatment. however, the levels of CD4+CD25+LAP+ regulatory T cells were increased in the mesenteric lymph nodes and spleens of NCDO 2118-treated mice. we did not find differences in CD11c+CD11b-CD103+ cells in mesenteric lymph nodes. however, the frequencies of these cells were increased in the spleen during colitis. none of the tested L. lactis strains induced IL-8 secretion above background levels. the effect of oral administration of L. lactis NCDO 2118 was tested in vivo. this experimental protocol mimics the remission and active periods of IBD. the body weight of mice significantly decreased during DSS treatment compared to the body weight of water-treated mice. bars are the mean of 6 mice/group, and the data are representative of three independent experiments; ANOVA, Tukey post-test. the ability of L. lactis NCDO 2118 to prevent DSS-induced colonic damage was evaluated at the histological level. is NCDO 2118 maintained sIgA production at intermediate levels. we measured sIgA levels after 2, 3 or 4 days of oral administration of L. lactis. l. lactis NCDO 2118 did not alter secretory IgA production. the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was significantly decreased in the DSS-treated group but not in the NCDO 2118-treated group at day 21. the TNF- level was increased in DSS-treated mice at day 14, while the TNF- level in the NCDO 2118-treated mice was maintained at a level similar to the control group. the population of CD4+CD25+CD45RBlow regulatory T cells was not affected by DSS or DSS-NCDO2118 treatment. the same result was observed for CD4+Foxp3+ Tregs. levels of CD4+CD25+LAP+ regulatory T cells were increased in the mesenteric lymph nodes and spleens of NCDO 2118-treated mice. culture supernatants of L. lactis NCDO 2118 reduced IL-8 production by Caco-2 cells stimulated with IL-1. expression of IL-8 has been shown that this transcriptional factor is overactivated in mucosal cells of IBD patients [26], thus, the search for alternative treatment against IBD is a good parameter to be considered. lactis NCDO 2118 strain has an immunomodulatory effect in IECs. this conclusion is based on the fact that IL-1 triggers transcriptional activation of pro-inflammatory genes in IECs. thus, IL-1 activates transcription factors, including nuclear factor B (NF-B), which induces increased expression of pro-inflammatory mediators. studies have shown that consumption of probiotics is associated with increased gut sIgA levels. this could promote the integrity of the gut immunological barrier by limiting the penetration of bacteria (commensal and pathogenic) into host tissues. but L. lactis did not alter sIgA production after oral treatment. IL-17 is generally thought to have a proinflammatory role in the intestine. but neutralisation of IL-17 can aggravate acute DSS-induced colitis in mice. IL-10 is most likely the most important cytokine involved in shaping immune responses at the gut mucosa. cells expressing the earliest inducible cell surface glycoprotein acquired during lymphoid activation, CD69, were analysed after colitis induction. despite anti-inflammatory activity of L. lactis NCDO 2118, its administration did not enhance the frequency of this regulatory T cell population. despite the anti-inflammatory activity of L. lactis NCDO 2118, its administration did not enhance the frequency of this regulatory T cell population. L. lactis NCDO 2118 has anti-inflammatory activity in an in vitro culture of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and in a DSS-induced model of colitis. the mechanisms involved in such anti-inflammatory effects include modulation of colonic cytokines as well as expansion of regulatory T cells. the nature of the L. lactis NCDO 2118 components that are responsible for its anti-inflammatory effects is under investigation. the nature of the components that are responsible for its anti-inflammatory effects is under investigation. cell cultures were fractionated by centrifugation into supernatant and cells. each fraction was co-incubated with Caco-2 cells. cells were washed 2 times with PBS and added at a multiplicity of infection. the total dose of bacteria per mouse was estimated to be 5109 bacteria/day. mice were sacrificed either at day 14 (immediately following the oral treatment) or after a second DSS cycle (at day 21) the control groups of mice received M17 or L. lactis alone. scores for each feature were summed up to a maximum possible score of 11. the plates were coated with purified monoclonal antibodies reactive for the cytokines IL-6, IL-12, IFN-, IL-17, IL-10, TGF- and TNF- (BD-Pharmingen) on the third day, biotinylated monoclonal antibodies were added. the absorbance was measured at 492 nm using an ELISA microplate reader (Bio-Rad) the levels of sIgA were determined by ELISA. the wells were washed and blocked with 200 l of PBS containing 0.25% casein for 1 h at room temperature. surface staining was performed according to standard procedures at density of 1106 cells per well. the results were analysed in a FACScan instrument (BD) the results were expressed as the mean standard error of the mean (SEM) RPMI medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% (v/v) of fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco), 2 mM L-glutamine, 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids, and 1 mM sodium pyruvate solution in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C. cells were seeded at 3105 cells/well in 24-well plates and incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for mice received either GM17 medium (DSS) or L. lactis NCDO 2118 (DSS + NCDO2118 group) orally for four consecutive days. each mouse drank approximately 5 mL of culture per day. the total dose of bacteria per mouse was estimated to be 5109 bacteria/day. colon samples were fixed in formalin and processed for histological analysis. hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections were blindly scored based on a previously described semi-quantitative scoring system. scores for each feature were summed up to a maximum possible score of 11. colour was developed at room temperature with 100 l/well of orthophenylenediamine (1 mg/ml) and 0.04% (v/v) H2O2 substrate in sodium citrate buffer. the reaction was interrupted by the addition of 20 l/well of 2 N H2SO4.
