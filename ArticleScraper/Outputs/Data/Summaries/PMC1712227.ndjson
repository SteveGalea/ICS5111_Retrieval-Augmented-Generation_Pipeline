{"summary": "a series of 16 reviews have been prepared as background for advice from the WHO Advisory Committee on health research to WHO. Objectives We searched five databases for existing systematic reviews and relevant primary methodological research. we used snowballing as a technique to obtain additional information. WHO should provide local support for adapting and implementing recommendations. modifying factors and values need to be assessed locally. modifying factors and values need to be assessed by developing tools, building capacity. 192 countries are members of WHO and scope of WHO's responsibilities. developing guidelines internationally poses challenges to ensure and monitor that WHO's guidelines are locally applicable or adaptable across different settings. the needs for adapting guidelines identified in the US survey are even greater for international guidelines. the initial body of evidence to be considered in WHO guidelines will be identical to that of traditional guidelines. if done properly, this will allow decision makers in different settings to take the third step of \"localizing\" the guidelines to their settings. only few WHO guideline processes have followed the GWG [8]. WHO provides funding and support for specific guideline adaptation efforts. specific WHO guideline adaptation projects exist in the area of HIV that have been supported by international workshops organized by regional offices with country involvement. SIGN The Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network (SIGN) asks guideline panels to consider issues of applicability when they summarize their view of the total body of evidence. the guidelines are graded to differentiate between those based on strong evidence and those based on weak evidence. aim is to produce a recommendation that is evidence-based, but which is relevant to the way in which health care is delivered in Scotland. Adapting overseas evidence-based guidelines using the AGREE instrument. review and recommendations will be most useful in conjunction with a participatory community planning process. guideline panels should consider issues of applicability when guideline groups summarize their view of the total body of evidence. the aim is to produce a recommendation that is evidence-based, but relevant to the way in which health care is delivered in Scotland. SIGN guideline development groups are provided with a form in which to record the main points from their considered judgement. the guide provides systematically collected and detailed information on several issues of importance to public health practitioners and decision makers. the key questions addressed in this paper were vetted amongst the authors and the ACHR Subcommittee on the use of research evidence. we searched PubMed using \"guideline\" AND \"adaptation OR applicability OR template OR transferability\" 203 citations were identified as systematic reviews using the clinical queries filter. the answers to the questions are our conclusions based on the available evidence. global recommendations should apply to most settings yet allow for adaptation to local circumstances. modifying factors, need, values and resources should be flagged. the research evidence on what reflects the best distribution of responsibilities during the development of international guidelines is sparse. global evidence (i.e. the best evidence from around the world) is the best starting point for judgements about effects and likely modifying factors. review of guidelines should be prepared or coordinated centrally, by WHO headquarters or by regional offices. support for local adaptation of guidelines should also be supported centrally, by WHO headquarters or by regional offices. implementation is topic of another paper in this series. the practice guideline evaluation and adaptation cycle (PGEAC) is a 10 step approach [17,41,42]. the other approach has been developed by the international working group ADAPTE. it overlaps with the PGEAC approach. international recommendations may be most helpful when variation in settings and local circumstances is less important. modifying factors such as conditions of the physical plant, absence of infection control infrastructure, limited sterilization capabilities, lack of clinical microbiologic laboratory support, and the expense of single use medical devices. influence the applicability or transferability of guidelines. it can be used during the guideline development process. it can be used to help ensure that these factors are considered systematically and transparently. WHO could adapt, commission or prepare systematic reviews for guideline development in collaboration with organizations such as these that conduct systematic reviews. adaptable evidence profiles based on new or existing high quality systematic reviews should also be prepared or coordinated centrally. the practice guideline evaluation and adapted cycle (PGEAC) is a 10 step approach. the practice guideline evaluation and adapted cycle (PGEAC) is a 10 step approach. manual on guideline adaptation will undergo pilot testing. process should be made explicit, undergo review by peers. consumers, policymakers and other stakeholders should be involved. systematic review of studies evaluating methods for adaptating guidelines is unlikely to retrieve high quality evidence given the paucity of research in this area. further development and evaluation of frameworks and tools to support the appropriate adaptation of guidelines is needed. similar suggestions have been made previously by investigators involved with WHO guideline projects. authors' contributions HJS prepared the first draft of this review. AF and ADO contributed to drafting and revising it. all authors read and approved the final manuscript."}
