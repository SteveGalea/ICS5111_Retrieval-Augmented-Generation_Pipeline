{"summary": "the Caliciviridae family is composed of five established genera, Lagovirus, Nebovirus, Norovirus, Sapovirus, and Vesivirus [2], with six additional unclassified new genera tentatively named Recovirus [3], Bavovirus [4, 5] Nacovirus [5\u20137], Salovirus [8], Sanovirus [9], and Valovirus [10]. the members in this family are important pathogens in both medical and veterinary fields. the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes orchestrate a variety of homeostatic processes and participate in various pathophysiological conditions. the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, which convert arachidonic acid into prostaglandins, orchestrate a variety of homeostatic processes. the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes orchestrate a variety of homeostatic processes. pesviridae [36], Rhabdoviridae [37], Retroviridae [38], Picornaviridae [39\u201340], Flaviviridae [42\u201343], paramyxoviridae [44], and paramyxoviridae [45]. some viruses including vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), enterovirus 71 (EV71), dengue virus [41], hepatitis C virus (48 treatment of PGE2 enhances the replication of HIV-1 in the CD4+ T-cell line MT-4 [60]. pharmacological inhibitors or siRNAs against COX-1 and COX-2 significantly reduced PSaV replication. this indicates that COX-2/PGE2 pathway has proviral effects for FCV and MNV replication. assas were routinely grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 g/ml streptomycin. the MNV strain CW-1 was a kind gift from Dr. H.W.

TCID50 assay The median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) of MNV and FCV strains in the samples obtained from the above experiments were determined as described previously. dilutions of clarified supernatants were prepared. Membranes were immunoblotted with primary antibodies against COX-1, COX-2, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), MNV VPg, or FCV capsid. secondary antibodies specific for rabbit or mouse IgG were added for 1 h at room temperature.

CRFK and RAW264.7 cells were treated with a selective COX-1 inhibitor (SC-560), a selective COX-2 inhibitor (NS398), or a nonselective COX inhibitor (indomethacin) at the indicated time points. cells pretreated with each inhibitor were washed to remove each inhibitor and then infected with FCV (MOI, 1 FFU/ml) or MNV (MOI, 1 TCID50/ml) strains analyses were performed using one-way analysis of variance. the results are presented as means and standard errors of the mean of three independent experiments. the addition of NS-398 (selective COX-2 inhibitor) caused a more significant reduction in FCV (4.5 log10) in both infectious virus and viral RNA. MNV infectious viral titer and genome copy numbers were reduced 3 log10. at 8 h post-infection (hpi) with FCV (MOI, 1 FFU/cell), viral titer and genome copy number were determined by TCID50/ml and quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) the inhibitory effects of each drug on the viral titer or genome copy number were compared between mock- and drug-treated groups. coX-1, COX-2, and scrambled (Scram) siRNAs were transfected in RAW264.7 cells. the samples were harvested at 24 hpi. the inhibitory effects of each siRNA on viral titer and genome copy number were compared between the mock- and each siRNA-transfected group. CRFK cells were pretreated or post-treated with noncytotoxic doses of SC-560, NS398, or indomethacin. at 8 h post-infection (hpi) with FCV (MOI, 1 FFU/ml) levels of viral capsid protein were determined by Western blot analysis. RAW264.7 cells were mock- or post-treated with a selective COX-2 inhibitor indomethacin. the cells were then incubated with MNV (MOI, 1 TCID50/ml) for 24 h. the effect of the drugs or COX-2 inhibitors on the expression level of viral VPg protein was determined by confocal microscopy. exogenous prostaglandin E2 can compensate for COX-induced inhibition of feline calicivirus and murine norovirus (MNV) replications. two doses of exogenous PGE2, 5 or 50 M for MNV, and 2 M or 20 M for FCV, were then added in the maintenance media. the time-dependent increase in the expression of COX-2 mRNA and protein levels was observed in parallel with increased FCV viral RNA synthesis (Fig 1A and 1C) the expression level of COX-1 mRNA and protein was also unaffected during MNV infection. intensity of each target protein relative to GAPDH was determined by densitometric analysis and is indicated above each lane. the levels of PGE2 in supernatants were compared between mock-and FCV-infected groups. the levels of PGE2 in the supernatants were compared between mock-and MNV-infected groups. the presented data are depicted as means and standard errors of the mean from three different experiments. ive COX inhibitor (indomethacin) washed to remove each inhibitor and then infected with FCV (MOI, 1 FFU/ml) or MNV (MOI, 1 TCID50/ml) strains. after virus adsorption, the inhibitor(s) were added in the maintenance media (Post) or before virus inoculation and maintained throughout the course of the infection (Pre-Post) induction of COX-2, together with the basal expression of COX-1, accounted for the increase in PGE2 in FCV and MNV-infected cells. induction of both COX enzymes reduce FCV and MNV replication. Indomethacin, a nonselective COX inhibitor, showed more significant effects on MNV infection. FCV infection elicited a 3 log10 decrease in infectious viral titer and genome copy numbers. there was no significant effect on FCV or MNV replication in cells pretreated with COX inhibitors. virus titer or genome copy number were compared between mock- and drug-treated groups. the samples were harvested at 8 hpi and then the viral titer and genome copy number were determined by TCID50/ml (G) and qRT-PCR (H) analyses. three independent experiments were conducted and presented as means and standard errors of the mean. a reduced production of FCV capsid protein was observed with the post-treatment of COX inhibitors in a dose-dependent manner. a reduced production of FCV capsid protein was observed with the post-treatment of COX inhibitors in a dose-dependent manner. the levels of viral capsid protein were determined by Western blot analysis. GAPDH was used as a loading control. CRFK cells transfected with COX-1, COX-2, or scrambled (Scram) siRNAs were incubated with FCV. RAW 264.7 cells were mock- or post-treated with a selective COX-2 inhibitor indomethacin. the cells were then incubated with MNV (MOI, 1 TCID50/ml) for 24 h. the effect of the drugs or COX-1, COX-2, or Scram siRNAs on the expression level of viral VPg protein was determined by confocal microscopy. two doses of exogenous PGE2, 5 or 50 M for MNV, and 2 M or 20 M for FCV, were then added in the maintenance media. samples were harvested at 8 h post-infection (hpi) for FCV and 24 hpi for MNV. the data presented are means and standard errors of the mean. the inhibition of COX-1 by its specific inhibitor and siRNA decreased the production of PGE2 and thereby the replication of both viruses. the inhibition of the basal expression level of COX-1 by its specific inhibitor and siRNA suppressed the production of PGE2. selective COX-2 inhibitor NS398 exerted 4 log10 suppression in the FCV titer compared to other inhibitors. in the FCV infection, the selective COX-2 selective inhibitor NS398 exerted 4 log10 suppression in the FCV titer compared to other inhibitors. these results suggest that COX inhibitors are potential candidates for the treatment of FCV and MNV infections. in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection, viral nucleocapsid protein activates COX-2/PGE2 pathway through direct binding to regulatory elements for NF-B and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein. NSAIDs, pharmacological inhibitors against COX-1 and -2 enzymes, can be used as therapeutic drugs for FCV, MNV, and others."}
