{"summary": "VCR-OA-loaded submicron emulsion exhibited homogeneous round shape. mean particle size, zeta potential, and encapsulation efficiency were 157.6 12.6 nm, 26.5 5.0 mV and 78.64% 3.44% respectively. vincristine is isolated from the leaves of the periwinkle plant catharanthus roseus. it is a cell cycle-specific anticancer drug that interferes with mitotic spindle microtubules3\u20137 and induces tumor cell apophysis. in the past few decades, optimizing the formulation has attracted much attention. the aim of this study was to prepare a novel and intravenously injectable submicron emulsion drug delivery system loaded with a VCR\u2013oleic acid (OA) ion complex. in order to encapsulate sulfate salt of VCR into emulsion drops, VCR-OA was constructed to improve the lipophilicity. after that, the physicochemical characterizations of VCR-OA-SME were analyzed. ylindole (DAPI) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO, USA) a Pierce bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit and an annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (V-FITC) apoptosis kit were bought from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA) and Nanjing KeyGen Biotechnology. 18 reverse phase column (150 4.6 mm, 5 m; AkzoNobel, Separation Products, Bohus, Sweden) and the mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile and 0.01 M NaH2PO4 (55/45, V/V pH 7.0, adjusted with triethylamine) were used to separate the targeted component. an MS operating condition was established to detect VCR. triple-quadrupole MS was carried out under positive electrospray ionization and multiple reaction-monitoring mode. ion recording used the parent ion of VCR at m/z 825.5 and the daughter ion of VCR at m/z 765.4. preparation of VCR-OA ion-pair complex was dissolved in 0.2 mL double-distilled water. natant was determined by HPLC. preparation of VCR-OA-SME was prepared based on high-pressure homogenization method. emulsion was filtered through membrane to obtain final formulation. ultrafiltration was collected and demulsified with ethanol to measure the amount of encapsulated VCR (VCRe) by HPLC. encapsulation efficiency and drug loading of VCR-OA-SME were then calculated by the following equations. the healthy adult male Wistar rats were divided randomly into two groups. group one and two were intravenously injected with VCR sulfate solution and VCR-OA-SME formulation. at fixed time points, 300 L of blood was collected from the eye socket into the heparinized tubes. cell-cycle distribution was measured by flow cytometry. cell-apoptosis induction is one side of VCR cytotoxicity79. on MCF-7 cells by VCR solution or VCR-OA-SME was measured qualitatively by DAPI (4\u20326-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining and quantitatively by annexin V-FITC and PI double-staining assay. cells floating in the supernatant were combined with the adherent fraction lysed by trypsin. twenty-four hours later, cells were exposed to free VCR and VCR-OA-SME at VCR concentrations of 10 and 20 g/mL and incubated for another 4 hours. cells were triedpsinized and collected by washing with PBS (pH 7.4, 4\u00b0C) to stop cell digestion, and free VCR was removed. statistical analysis All data subjected to statistic analysis were obtained from at least three parallel experiments. t-test was used for significance analysis, and P 0.05 was lowest level of significance to value difference between two groups. cells were kept in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C. each group of five rats was fed in one cage with free access to standard rat chow and water in well-controlled conditions. the biological samples consisted of lysed cell suspensions and plasma. they were preprocessed by the protein-precipitation method with acetonitrile. the supernatant was filtrated through 0.22 m aperture membranes. ethanol was added to disrupt the emulsion, and 20 L of the resulting transparent solution was injected into an HPLC system. each 3 L sample was eluted for 2.5 minutes by mobile phase consisting of methanol and a. triple-quadrupole MS was carried out under positive electrospray ionization and multiple reaction-monitoring mode. ion recording used the parent ion of VCR at m/z 825.5 and the daughter ion of VCR at m/z 765.4. VCR concentration in the supernatant was determined by HPLC. all the analyses were carried out in triplicate. emulsion was filtered through a membrane to obtain the final formulation. the sample was stained with 2% (w/v) phosphotungstic acid before being placed on copper grids with films for transmission electron microscopy (H-600; Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). encapsulation efficiency and drug loading of VCR-OA-SME were determined by ultrafiltration. the ultrafiltrate was collected and diluted with ethanol to measure the amount of encapsulated VCR (VCRe) by HPLC. in addition, VCR-OA-SME was demulsified with ethanol to determine the amount of total VCR (VCRt) the encapsulation efficiency and drug loading of the free drug were then calculated by the following equations. male Wistar rats, weighing 220 20 g (mean standard deviation), were divided randomly into two groups. group one and two were intravenously injected with VCR sulfate solution and VCR-OA-SME formulation. plasma separated by centrifuge (2000 g, 5 minutes) was stored under 80\u00b0C. cell-cycle distribution was measured by flow cytometry. cell-apoptosis induction is one side of VCR cytotoxicity. cell-apoptosis induction is one side of VCR cytotoxicity. OA-SME was measured qualitatively by DAPI (4\u20326-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining and quantitatively by annexin V-FITC and PI double-staining assay. cells floating in the supernatant were combined with the adherent fraction lysed by trypsin (0.25%) and washed thrice with PBS. cells exposed to culture medium without VCR served as negative control. the medium was replaced with MTT solution (5 mg/mL), followed by 4-hour incubation. the solution was removed carefully and 200 L dimethyl sulfoxide was added to each well to dissolve formazan. cell-cycle distribution was measured by flow cytometry (Cytomics FC500; Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) for each sample, 1 105 cells were collected. cell-apoptosis induction is one side of VCR cytotoxicity79. cells were incubated with annexin V-FITC and PI for another 15 minutes. cells were incubated with annexin V-FITC and PI for another 15 minutes. cell-uptake efficiency was evaluated by the uptake index. UI = C VCR ( ng/mL ) C Protein ( mg/mL ) = C VCR C Protein ( ng/mg ). UI of cells incubated with VCR solution or VCR-OA-SME (CVCR = 10 g/mL) at 4\u00b0C or 37\u00b0C for 2 hours. vinca alkaloid in which there are two ionizable tertiary nitrogen atoms. positively charged VCR can attach to a negatively charged carboxyl group of fatty acid. OA (pKa = 4.78 0.10) is a kind of biodegradable long-chain fatty acid with high biocompatibility. solubility of VCR and VCR-OA in double-distilled water was 734.7 19.4 g/mL and 69.0 9.0 g/mL respectively. the significant change in solubility of VCR in water demonstrated the formation of an ion pair with OA. the negative charge on the surface of the emulsion drops was mainly responsible for the electrostatic repelling force among the particles. the negatively charged OA may serve as a contributor for the zeta potential. in vitro release of VCR from VCR-oleic acid ion pair complex-loaded submicron emulsion (VCR-OA-SME) may come from the small fraction of drug adsorbed on the surface of the emulsion drops. in vitro therapeutic effect study In vitro cytotoxicity study Cytotoxicity of free VCR, VCR-OA-SME, and blank SME was significantly lower than that in the free VCR group. VCR-OA-SME can be endocytosed in an intact form due to its small size and the surface charge. VCR-OA has a higher hydrophobicity than free VCR and thus has a better affinity to the cell membrane. cell population in the sub-G1 phase in the VCR-OA-SME group was more than that in the VCR solution group (P 0.001) more cells in the sub-G1 phase in the VCR-OA-SME group were arrested in the sub-G1 phase. more cells were arrested in the sub-G1 phase for the VCR solution group compared with other groups. the apoptotic cell nucleus in the control group was maintained with homogeneous chromatin. the significant chromatin condensation, nuclear fragmentation, or even apoptotic body formation could be found in the VCR-treated groups. DAPI staining of fragmented chromatin or apoptotic bodies in MCF-7 cells after being treated with VCR solution or VCR-OA-SME for 24 hours. scale bar = 30 m (n = 3). me was both temperature- and energy-dependent. however, the uptake of VCR solution became undetectable. the presence of sodium azide existed indicating that the uptake of VCR solution was mostly temperature-dependent. ionizable drugs by shielding their charge with an oppositely charged ion instead of chemical modifications. ion pair composed of leuprolide sodium oleate increased the lipophilicity of leuprolide and was good for entrapment into microspheres. hydrophobic ionpair formation was chosen to be the strategy. a mixed solvent composed of dichloromethane and ethanol was used. in this study, a mixed solvent composed of dichloromethane and ethanol was used. in the preparation of VCR-OA, excess amounts of NaHCO3 and OA were added to VCR solution. the average size and polydispersity index were 157.6 12.6 nm and 0.204 0.02, respectively. this size was smaller than conventional emulsion, probably due to the presence of adequate surfactants. negatively charged OA may serve as a contributor for the zeta potential. the release rate of VCR-OA-SME was much slower than that of VCR solution. the lower burst release was more beneficial, since the toxicity of VCR was normally associated with extremely high drug concentration. however, the higher burst release may cause a higher risk of serious side effects. the area under the curve value of VCR-OA-SME is higher than that of VCR solution. there is no doubt that slower clearance and higher bioavailability are beneficial for higher drug accumulation in tumors. in vitro therapeutic effect study In vitro cytotoxicity assay Cytotoxicity of free VCR, VCR-OA-SME, and blank SME was compared by conducting an MTT assay. cell-survival rate in the group was significantly lower than that in the free VCR group (P 0.05), demonstrating that VCR-OA-SME showed higher anticancer efficacy than free VCR solution. tubulin assembly and induce tubulin self-association into coiled spiral aggregates, resulting in cells arrested in the G2/M phase, ie, antimitotic effects. the effect of VCR solution and VCR-OA-SME on the cell cycle using MCF-7 cells was evaluated. morphology of MCF-7 cells significantly changed after VCR treatment. cells became partly round, and some floated in the culture medium. it is well known that apoptotic cell nucleus will show many morphologic modifications. cell apoptosis (45.80% 5.56%) than free VCR (30.43% 4.07%) (P 0.05) was consistent with higher cytotoxicity data of VCR-OA-SME. DAPI staining of fragmented chromatin or apoptotic bodies in MCF-7 cells. the cell-survival rate in the VCR-OA-SME group was significantly lower than that in the free VCR group. it is reported that the in vitro cytotoxicity may come from drug property and release profile. VCR-OA-SME could arrest more cells in the G2/M phase (P 0.001) and fewer cell populations in the G0/G1 phase (P 0.01) when VCR concentration was 10 or 20 ng/mL, the cell population in the sub-G1 phase was more than that in the VCR solution group (P 0.001). cell nucleus-morphology change was more severe in the VCR-OA-SME group. cells were stained with annexin-V/PI, early apoptotic, late apoptotic or secondary necrotic. DAPI staining of fragmented chromatin or apoptotic bodies in MCF-7 cells after being treated with VCR solution or VCR-OA-SME for 24 hours. in vitro cellular uptake assay was conducted on MCF-7 cells. the cell uptake of VCR-OA-SME was significantly restrained at 4\u00b0C and in the presence of sodium azide. however, the VCR solution uptake by cells incubated at 4\u00b0C became undetectable (UI = 0), whereas the presence of sodium azide existed. the additional cell-uptake pathway of VCR-OA-SME (the energy-dependent cell uptake) may be one of the reasons for its higher uptake efficiency and cytotoxicity. in vitro release rate of VCR-OA-SME was significantly slower than that of the VCR solution. in vivo study showed that VCR-OA-SME had a longer mean retention time compared to the VCR solution."}
