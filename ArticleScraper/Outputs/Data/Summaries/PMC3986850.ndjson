{"summary": "transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) causes diarrhea in piglets with an age-dependent decrease of severity. pigs receiving high Zn diet showed a down-regulation of interferon (IFN)-, oligoadenylate synthetase (ZIP4), but up-regulation of metallothionein-1 (MT1) and the Zn transporters SLC30A5 (ZnT5). zinc (Zn) has broad-spectrum antiviral activity against a variety of viruses. zinc mediates antiviral effects through inhibition of nidovirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerases or other proteins essential for the different phases of the viral life cycle. high levels of dietary Zn provided as ZnO have been shown to outbalance Zn homeostasis with increased accumulation of Zn in various organs including the small intestine of piglets [18,19]. high dietary Zn levels could indirectly increase the intestinal barrier function as a protection mechanism of the epithelium. high-dose Zn prevents diarrhea in piglets but does not affect other trace elements. there was no difference in dehydration, anorexia, lethargy and body temperature. fecal score from 2 to 7 dpi was also higher in Znhigh compared to the Znlow control group. systemic and mucosal immune responses of piglets measured by ELISA. all piglets fed with different concentrations of Zn were negative for TGEV-specific serum IgG antibodies. serum antibody response after infection occurred earlier in piglets. expression of genes for cytokines and metal binding/transport proteins in intestinal tissues in the three Zn treatment groups. there was a statistically significant increase of IFN- expression in the Znlow group compared to the Znhigh group (P = 0.009) piglets from the Znlow group showed a destruction of the architecture of intestinal tissue with villous atrophy, which resulted in a significant reduction of the intestinal surface area by a factor of 1.38 (n = 6, P = 0.009) compared to the Znmed group where no villus at. jejunal tissue from piglets fed with Znlow, Znmed, and Znhigh diets was sliced and stained. the bottom and upper dashed lines indicate the basal and apical borders of the epithelium. the middle dashed line represents the transition zone from where villi go up. apoptotic cells are presented by cells being positive for cleaved caspase-3 in jejunal epithelium at 1 dpi. only the villus lining was apoptotic, while the crypt epithelium stayed intact. vivo measure for in vivo diarrhea susceptibility was quantified as increase in short-circuit current, ISCFSK,corr. it was found to be increased in jejunal tissue from TGEV-infected Znlow piglets (ISCFSK, corr, 110 11 A/cm2, n = 8) compared to Znmed (54 5 A/cm2, Znlow vs. Znlow, P = 0.0002, n = 9) glucose-induced short-circuit currents (ISCGlc, corr) of Znlow (n = 7), Znmed (n = 8), and Znhigh (n = 8) were not significantly different. the body weight in Znhigh was higher at 7, 14 and 18 dpi compared to both other groups. low amounts of shedding TGEV could be detected by qPCR from 1 to 6 dpi. highest incidence was observed at 4 dpi with 4 out of 10 positive TGEV shedding piglets in each group. the concentration of sIgA antibodies in intestinal wash fluids was measured by a direct ELISA. the levels of sIgA antibodies in intestinal wash fluids were increased 6 to 7-fold from 1 to 18 dpi. the differences between the groups were only marginal. n = 10) (horizontal lines) and lower and upper quartiles (bottoms and tops of boxes) the vertical bars in the box plots indicate the minimal and maximal values recorded. Asterisk indicates statistically significant differences (P 0.05) between Zn treatment groups. piglets from the Znlow group showed a destruction of the architecture of intestinal tissue with villous atrophy. no further changes in villus morphology in the Znhigh group (n = 6) could be detected. the epithelial architecture of Znmed and Znhigh jejunum was apparently not impaired. jejunal specimens were morphometrically analyzed by measuring lengths of apical epithelial and the mucosa\u2019s muscular linings. the ratio of mucosal-to-serosal surface area represents a measurement for the effective epithelial area. the latter conditions were not significantly different. permeability to the paracellular marker fluorescein did not significantly differ in TGEV-challenged jejunal epithelia in any of the animals. forskolin (FSK)-induced chloride secretion was quantified as increase in short-circuit current, ISCFSK,corr. it was found to be increased in jejunal tissue from TGEV-infected piglets. all values were corrected for the epithelial surface area (corr) Epithelia from the Znlow group exhibited significantly decreased Repi, corr values (P = 0.01, n = 8) compared to the Znhigh group (n = 10). fluorescein permeability (PFLUcorr) did not significantly differ between Zn groups. piglets infected with a cell-culture adapted TGEV strain for which direct antiviral effects of Zn were proven in vitro[5], and tested if direct antiviral and/or systemic effects of different Zn levels could be observed in vivo. in this study, TGEV infection caused only mild clinical symptoms. supplementation of Zn reduced methotrexate-induced intestinal damage and resulted in faster recovery. supplemental Zn to rats with experimental colitis improved mucosal repair by regulating tight junction permeability. sIgA levels increased from 1 to 18 dpi, indicating adaptive mucosal immune responses were induced by TGEV infection but not influenced by the diet. the expression of IL-6 in the intestinal tissues also showed no difference between the dietary groups at 1 dpi. metallothionein is known to be induced by exposure to heavy metal cations. expression level of MT1 was higher with concomitant high levels of Zn in piglets. this indicates an outbalanced Zn homeostasis. changes in absorption of water and electrolytes may counteract TGEV infection. the data could be interpreted as a result of a different pathological mechanism, possibly mediated by IFN-, rather than by TNF-. the data could be interpreted as a result of a different pathological mechanism, possibly mediated by IFN-, rather than by TNF-. the piglets were fed the diet ad libitum in a pelleted form. water was also provided ad libitum by nipple drinkers. the pens were equipped with a feeding automate with 5 feeding places. at day 28 of age, all piglets were challenged orally with 2 mL TGEV. blood samples were collected at 0, 4, 7, 11, 14 and 18 dpi. piglets were monitored daily for rectal temperature and body weight was recorded once weekly. piglets were monitored daily for rectal temperature and body weight was recorded once weekly. real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis Total RNA was extracted from 20 mg of jejunum sample or 200 L of serum using a Nucleo-Spin\u00ae RNA II Kit for Tissue. PCR reactions were performed in a total volume of 25 L in an iCycler iQ5\u00ae detection system. a mean expression value (normalization factor) for the four reference genes was calculated to enable normalization of gene expression data for all the genes of interest. samples from Znmed group were used the references for the calculations. forskolin (Calbiochem\u00ae, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany; final concentration 10 M), a secretagogue agent, was added basolaterally in supplemented Ringer\u2019s solution. glucose (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany; final concentration 10 mM) was added apically in glucose-free Ringer\u2019s solution. changes in short-circuit current (ISC) were recorded. fluorescein concentrations were determined with a fluorometer at 525 nm (infinite M200, Tecan, Crailsheim, Germany) at 30 and 90 min post administration, basolateral samples were replaced with Ringer\u2019s solution. tissue slices were incubated with goat anti-rabbit F(ab')2 conjugated with DyLightTM488 (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Newmarket, UK) at a 1:500 dilution and 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI, 1 g/mL; Roche, Mannheim, Germany) for 60 min at RT in the dark. a stable mycoplasma-free swine testicle (ST) cell line supporting the growth of TGEV was used in this study. animals were weaned at the age of 21 days and were randomly assigned to three different dietary groups. the pens were equipped with a feeding automate with 5 feeding places and a nipple drinker. rooms were kept at 25 1\u00b0C with humidity of 50 - 60% and constant air volume exchange. at day 28 of age, all piglets were challenged orally with 2 mL TGEV with a titer of 1.0E+07 PFU/mL. jejunum (approximately 100 cm distal to the duodeno-jejunal flexure), ileum (distal 15 cm), spleen and jejunal mesenteric lymph nodes were taken to determine gene expression profiles. defined pieces of the jejunum of the same length were washed with 25 mL PBS and intestinal fluid was collected to detect adaptive immune response (sIgA) quantitative real-time RT-PCR was performed using the one-step QRT-PCR master mix kit (Brilliant\u00aeII SYBR\u00aeGreen, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, USA) expression levels of IFN-, IL-6, OAS, and TNF- were calculated using the delta-Delta-Ct-Method calculation. intestinal wash fluid was collected on 1 and 18 dpi. mucosal sIgA antibodies were also measured using a commercial ELISA. resistances of bath solution without tissue were recorded prior to each experiment. fluorescein (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) was added apically (final concentration, 50 M) at 30 and 90 min post administration, basolateral samples were replaced with Ringer\u2019s solution. permeabilities were calculated using the freehand line selection tool of Image J. the surface area of the jejunal mucosa was assessed as the ratio of mucosal-to-serosal surface area from the length of apical epithelial as well as muscular mucosa linings. sections were embedded using ProTaqs Mount Fluor (Biocyc, Luckenwalde, Germany) after washing, tissue slices were incubated in blocking solution for 60 min at RT in the dark. digital images were processed using Fiji imaging software [46] and Zeiss LSM 510 META software.
