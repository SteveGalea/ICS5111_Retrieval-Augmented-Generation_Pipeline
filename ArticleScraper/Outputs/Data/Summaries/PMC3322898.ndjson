{"summary": "Methods Study Setting and Population Hospital A is a 256-bed community hospital that provides medical, surgical, obstetric, and pediatric care in the Greater Toronto area. on march 7, 2003, the 42-year-old son (patient A) of the index patient in the Toronto SARS outbreak (1) was seen in the emergency department. on march 17, a 77-year-old man (patient B) who had been exposed to patient A in the emergency room on March 7 was admitted to the hospital\u2019s 15-bed information from the charts was then used to interview nurses about the specific care provided during their shifts. a suspected case was described as fever (>38\u00b0 C), cough or breathing difficulty, and one or more of the following exposures during the 10 days before onset of symptoms. a suspected case was described as fever (>38\u00b0 C), cough or breathing difficulty, and one or more of the following exposures during the 10 days before onset of symptoms. 256-bed community hospital provides medical, surgical, obstetric, and pediatric care in the Greater Toronto Area. on march 7, 2003, the 42-year-old son (patient A) of the index patient in the Toronto SARS outbreak (1) was seen in the emergency department. on march 17, a 77-year-old man (patient B) who had been exposed to patient A in the emergency room was admitted to the hospital\u2019s 15-bed coronary care unit (CCU) on march 13. a suspected case was described as fever (>38\u00b0 C), cough or breathing difficulty, and one or more of the following exposures during the 10 days before onset of symptoms. a suspected case was described as fever (>38\u00b0 C), cough or breathing difficulty, and one or more of the following exposures during the 10 days before onset of symptoms. all cohort nurses were female; the mean age was 41 years. only two nurses had a history of respiratory illness (one asthma, one bronchitis) the most common symptoms included fever (8 [100%] of 8), myalgia (7 [87.5%] of 8), cough (6 [75%] of 8) and chills (6 [75%] of 8). exposed or unexposed) (%) Relative risk (95% CI) p value Exposed Unexposed Intubation 3/4 (75) 5/28 (18) 4.20 (1.58 to 11.14) 0.04 Suctioning before intubation 3/4 (75) 5/28 (18) 4.20 (1.58 to 11.14) 0.04 Suctioning after intubation 4/19(21) 4/13(31) 0.68 (0.21 to 2.26) 0.04 Nebulizer treatment 3/5(20) .51 to 5.46) 0.43 Venipuncture 6/17 (35) 2/ 15 (13) 2.65 (0.63 to 11.19) 0.23 Manipulation of commodes or bedpans 3/5 (60) 5/ 27 (19) 3.24 (1.11 to 9.42) 0.09 Feeding 2/10 (20) 6/22 (27) 0.73 (0.18 to 3.02) 1.00 Debrillation 0/2 (0) 8/ 30 (0.27) 1.00 Cardiopulmonary res three (13%) of 23 nurses who consistently wore a mask (either surgical or N95) acquired SARS compared to 5 (56%) of 9 nurses who did not consistently wear a mask (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.78, p = 0.02) the difference in RR for SARS infection for nurses who consistently wore surgical masks was not significant. intubation 4 5 ICU 935 Gloves Gown N95 Gogglesd Intubation 5 3 ICU 555 Gloves Gown N95 Gogglesd Intubation 6 2 CCU 510 None 7 2 CCU 40 None 8 2 CCU 510 Glovesd aSARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome;
