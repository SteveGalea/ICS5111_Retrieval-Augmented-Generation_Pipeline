{"summary": "the epidemiology of local viral etiologies is essential for the management of viral respiratory tract infections. limited data are available in china to describe the epidemiology of viral respiratory infections, especially in small\u2013medium cities and rural areas. the most frequently reported viruses include respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza viruses A and B (IAV, IBV), parainfluenza viruses (PIVs), human rhinovirus (HRV) and adenovirus (ADV), which are responsible for most episodes of ARTIs in children. the annual average temperature and relative humidity of Shenzhen are about 23\u00b0C (12\u201333\u00b0C) and 77% respectively. the study is to investigate the prevalence, seasonality and clinical characteristics of acute viral respiratory infections in hospitalized children in shenzhen. total viral nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) were extracted from 200 l of NPA specimen. purified DNA and RNA were stored at 80\u00b0C in aliquots for further PCR analysis. diagnosis of childhood community acquired pneumonia was based on the guideline of the management of childhood community acquired pneumonia (CAP) issued by the Chinese Medical Association in 2006. symptoms include fever, cough, tachypnoea (defined according to different age), difficulty breathing and/or lower chest wall indrawing. X-ray evaluation has been carried out when necessary. 2025 specimens were obtained from 2025 eligible patients ranging from 15 days to 14 years old with a median age of 12 months. there were 964 (476%) females and 1061 (524%) males included. 840% involved lower respiratory infection and 160% had upper respiratory tract infection. overall detection of viruses About 971 of the 2025 cases (480%) were positive for at least one viral pathogen. single infection was observed in 669 (689%) cases. multiple infection was found in 302 (311%) viral agents according to age groups 6 months, n = 595 6 months \u2013 1 years, n = 408 1\u20132 years, n = 408 2\u20134 years, n = 404 4\u20136 years, n = 96 All ages, n = 2025 No. (%) Mixed No. (%) Mixed No. (%) Mixed No. (%) Mixed No. (%) Mixed No. (%) Mixed No. (%) Mixed No. (%) Mixed Positive 300 (148)*,** 1 (333) 7 (07) 5 (714) 2 (02) 2 (1000) 0 (00) 0 (00) 21 (22) 14 (667) HRV 66 (68) 34 (515) 45 (46) 25 (556) 44 (45) 27 (614) 38 (39) 28 (737) 9 (09) 5 (556) 7 (07) 5 (714) 209 (215) 124 (593) PIV1 15 (15) 8 (533) 14 (14) 9 (643) co-infection of viruses About 302 co-infection cases were identified, accounting for 149% of all 2025 hospitalized children. 143 of 302 (474%) co-infection cases were detected during that time. 247 (818%), 49 (162%) and 5 (17%) were infected with two, three and four potential viral pathogens. one multiple infection with five viruses was detected in a 6-month-old infant. the seasonality profile of each individual virus detected was diversified. a wide seasonal peak of IAV infection was detected from March to August 2009. the peak duration in 2009 was longer than those in other years. positive rates of oyV infection in male and female were 525% and 475% respectively. no significant gender difference was revealed. of all 971 positive children, 890 (917%) were 4 years old. nchitis 62 21 83 112 195 Bronchiolitis 128 54 182 173 355 Pneumonia 387 185 572 579 1151 URTI 92 42 134 190 324 URTI, upper respiratory tract infection; RSV, respiratory syncytial virus; IVA, influenza virus A; IBV, influenza virus B; HRV, human rhinovirus; BOV, human bocavirus; ADV, adenovirus; H the most frequently detected pathogen was IAV (261%, 348/1335), followed by RSV (222%, 296/1335), HRV (157%, 209/1335), PIV1 and PIV3 (127%, 169/1335) among all 348 cases with IAV infection, 200 (577%) were hospitalized from March to August 2009.
