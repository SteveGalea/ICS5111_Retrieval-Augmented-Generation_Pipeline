{"summary": "ribosome profiling is a technique based on deep sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments. it provides genome-wide information of mRNAs that are actively translated. ribosome profiling can also simultaneously reveal the translation of host mRNAs during a viral infection. poxviruses are a family of large DNA viruses that include highly pathogenic members that infect humans and economically important animals. they are also developed as agents for cancer therapy and as vaccine vectors (19, 20) vaccination with VACV may also cause complications such as keratitis, conjunctival disease, and iritis in immunocompromised individuals. a viral infection enhanced oxidative phosphorylation through translational upregulation. a short 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of the oxidative phosphorylation mRNAs contributed to the translational upregulation. a viral infection enhanced oxidative phosphorylation through translational upregulation. mRNAs are green and RPFs are red under mock-infected (C) and VACV-infected (D) conditions. ribosome profiling experiments were highly reproducible, as evidenced by the very strong correlation coefficient (r, >0.98) of two sets of completely independent ribosome profiling experiments (biological replicates) mRNA depletion plays a dominant role in host protein synthesis shutoff. we first evaluated the contribution of mRNA depletion to VACV-induced host protein synthesis shutoff. the multidimensional scaling plot showed a dramatic overall change in cellular mRNA reads at 4 and 8 hpi. mRNA depletion was the major contributor to VACV-induced host protein synthesis shutoff. global analysis of mRNA and RPF reads reveals the characteristics of VACV-induced host shutoff. mRNA depletion was the major contributor to host protein synthesis shutoff. gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed no significantly enriched pathways at both the mRNA and RPF levels when using a cutoff with an adjusted P value of 0.05 by Benjamini and Hochberg's false discovery rate (FDR), which was not a surprise because of the global shutoff. only a very limited number of genes being upregulated. a relative TE analysis has been shown to be an effective way to identify differentially translated mRNAs in HCMV infection (32) mRNAs with differential TE (>2-fold) can serve as a compensating mechanism to maintain or increase protein levels in context of decreased mRNA levels. the functions of the genes involved may be important for VACV replication or cell survival. relative TE of mRNAs involved in oxidative phosphorylation increased significantly. mRNA levels decreased at 4 and 8 hpi of VACV infection. oxidative phosphorylation proteins were synthesized during the shutoff. the newly synthesized proteins were precipitated and detected with a total oxidative phosphorylation human antibody cocktail. the results indicated higher levels of UQCRC2, SDHB, and MT-CO2 in VACV-infected cells than in mock-infected cells. the ATP5A level remained stable (or slightly increased) and the NDUFB8 level decreased. total proteins and newly synthesized proteins labeled with AHA-containing peptides with alkyne-biotin were subjected to Western blotting analyses with a total oxidative phosphorylation human antibody cocktail. the ATP synthase activity and ATP level increased significantly in VACV-infected HeLa cells (Fig. 6A and E) fly luciferase gene under the control of a VACV early/late promoter indicated that the expression of both early and late VACV genes was affected by CCCP or antimycin A treatment. this suggested that the impairment of oxidative phosphorylation started to affect VACV replication at the stage of early gene expression after entry. these results demonstrated that the oxidative phosphorylation function is important for VACV replication and its ATP generation capacity is enhanced during VACV infection. CV titers were determined by a plaque assay at 24 hpi. significant differences from the titer with no CCCP treatment are indicated by asterisks. ATP levels were determined 16 hpi with an ATP determination kit. the median length of the longest forms of individual 5\u2032 UTRs is 102 nucleotides (nt) for oxidative phosphorylation mRNAs and 161 nt for the overall mRNAs. a shorter 5\u2032 UTR with a less complex secondary structure may contribute to the higher TE of the corresponding mRNAs in VACV-infected cells. short 5\u2032 UTRs of oxidative phosphorylation mRNAs can confer a translational advantage on VACV-infected cells. luciferase activity was normalized to a cotransfected Renilla luciferase mRNA. each result is an average of at least three independent experiments. the luciferase activity of the reporter with the tandem 5\u2032 UTR copies was higher than that with one copy of the COX6A1 5\u2032 UTR in uninfected cells. this suggests that a short 5\u2032 UTR could confer a translational advantage of oxidative phosphorylation mRNAs on VACV-infected cells during host shutoff. RNA-Seq and ribosome profiling quantitatively measured the levels of total and actively translating mRNAs. we obtained 114.6 to 135.8 million reads from individual RNA-Seq samples. 38.0 to 98.7 million ribosome-protected fragments (RPFs) from individual ribosome profiling samples that were mapped to human and VACV genomes. the correlation coefficients were >0.98 in all of the pairwise comparisons of experiments from the three time points. the high quality of cellular ribosome-protected RNA fragment (RPF) reads was evidenced by the expected high mapping rates in coding DNA sequences (CDSs) and 5\u2032 UTRs and low mapping rates of 3\u2032 UTRs and introns of cellular genes. the distribution of RPKMs of mRNA and RPF reads virtually overlapped in mock infection experiments at 2, 4, and 8 hpi. the overall RPKMs in VACV-infected cells decreased dramatically after infection, indicating a host shutoff at both the transcriptional and translational levels. cellular mRNA depletion was the major contributor to VACV-induced host protein synthesis shutoff. gene set enrichment analysis showed no significantly enriched pathways at both the mRNA and RPF levels when using a cutoff with an adjusted P value of 0.05 by Benjamini and Hochberg's false discovery rate (FDR) gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed no significantly enriched pathways at both the mRNA and RPF levels. translationally upregulated cellular genes (log2 DTE, 1;, 1 or greater) are red. downregulated genes (log2 DTE, 1 or greater;, 1 or greater) are blue. numbers of up/down-regulated genes are also shown. oxidative phosphorylation is the metabolic pathway in which ATP is produced through a series of biochemical reactions in mitochondria. in human cells, the mitochondrial genome encodes 13 proteins that are subunits of oxidative phosphorylation (33, 34) in human cells, the mitochondrial genome encodes 13 proteins that are subunits of oxidative phosphorylation. the downregulation of mRNA levels and upregulation of protein levels involved in oxidative phosphorylation were verified by quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and Western blotting of nuclear genome-encoded SDHB and mitochondrial genome-encoded MT-CO1 and MT-CO2. the newly synthesized proteins were precipitated and detected with a total oxidative phosphorylation human antibody cocktail that recognizes five proteins of the oxidative phosphorylation complexes. Western blotting analyses of SDHB, MT-CO1 and MT-CO2 gene mRNA levels during the course of VACV infection. beta-tubulin and GAPDH were used as loading controls. results representative of at least three independent experiments are shown. CCCP inhibited VACV replication in a dose-dependent manner. the block of VACV replication by CCCP and antimycin A was at or before late viral protein expression. oxidative phosphorylation activity plays an important role in VACV infection. VACV titers were determined at 24 hpi by a plaque assay. significant differences from the titer with no CCCP treatment were indicated. ATP levels were determined 16 hpi with an ATP determination kit. short 5\u2032 UTRs of oxidative phosphorylation mRNAs can confer a translational advantage on VACV-infected cells. the 5\u2032 UTR plays an important role in the regulation of mRNA translation (36). the median length of the longest forms of individual 5\u2032 UTRs is 102 nucleotides (nt) for oxidative phosphorylation mRNAs. luciferase activity was measured as an indicator of mRNA translation. all of the 5\u2032 UTRs tested exhibited higher luciferase activities in VACV-infected cells. the enhancement does not correspond linearly to the length of the 5\u2032 UTRs. ase activity was normalized to a cotransfected Renilla luciferase mRNA (transfection control) for each reporter mRNA, the luciferase activity in mock-infected cells was normalized as 1. Each result is an average of at least three independent experiments. DISCUSSION VACV infection causes cellular mRNA degradation. this degradation occurs through a combined action of VACV-encoded decapping enzymes D9 and D10 and cellular nuclease XRN1. mRNA depletion plays a major role during the VACV-induced host shutoff that results in similar reductions of ribosome-associated cellular mRNAs. oxidative phosphorylation is still a major source of ATP production (43). a study by Fontaine et al. showed that VACV depends more on glutamine than on glucose for efficient replication. oxidative phosphorylation is required when using glutamine as cellular fuel. enterovirus 71 and dengue virus infections cause an oxidative phosphorylation dysfunction in infected cells. impaired oxidative phosphorylation function may be able to provide sufficient energy for some viruses. however, for viruses that need a large amount of energy, the impaired oxidative phosphorylation function could restrict viral replication. a short 5\u2032 UTR in Drosophila is responsible for the higher TE of some oxidative phosphorylation mRNAs under the condition of dietary restriction (55). the 5\u2032 UTRs of early mRNAs vary from 3 to 601 nt, with a median length of 21 nt, while the 5\u2032 UTRs of intermediate and late mRNAs all have a poly(A) leader with a length of up to 51 nt (56, oxidative phosphorylation in mammals involves >100 genes encoded in both the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. translation of oxidative phosphorylation mRNAs occurs in both the cytoplasm and mitochondria by using two distinct translation systems. mRNAs important in cell maintenance processes such as oxidative phosphorylation are less affected during virus-induced host shutoff. identification of these selectively translated proteins is important to elucidate the functional relevance of and mechanism involved during a virus-induced host shutoff. the experimental procedures for ribosome profiling and RNA-Seq were described previously. ribosome profiling and RNA-Seq were carried out as described elsewhere. mRNA was isolated from a portion of the lysate with oligo(dT) the DNA reference sequences encoding rRNAs were obtained from the Genomic tRNA Database (67). reads were mapped to both the human genome (Ensembl, GRCh37) and the VACV genome (NC_006998.1) with Tophat (v0.6.1p2) (68). gene with a logarithmic DTE value of >1 were defined as translationally upregulated genes. those with a logarithmic DTE value of less than 1 were defined as translationally downregulated genes. genes with a logarithmic DTE value of less than 1 were defined as translationally downregulated genes.
