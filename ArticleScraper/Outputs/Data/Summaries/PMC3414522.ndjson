{"summary": "seasonal, pandemic, and zoonotic influenza viruses cause annual epidemics during autumn and winter in temperate regions. they predominantly cause upper respiratory tract disease with rare extension to the lower respiratory tract, resulting in severe and even fatal pneumonia. zoonotic influenza viruses, like the pandemic H1N1 virus in 2009, cause sporadic pandemics with variable mortality. our results showed that, at 4 days post inoculation, pH1N1 caused pneumonia intermediate in severity between that caused by seasonal H1N1 and HPAI H5N1. this was associated with virus replication throughout the lower respiratory tract for pH1N1, while seasonal H1N1 replicated mainly in the bronchi. however, the location of virus replication and extent and severity of associated pathological changes were recorded at a single time point. trachea-bronchial lymph nodes were slightly enlarged between 0.5 and 4 dpi, with a peak on 1 dpi in the nasal swabs. the mean body weight loss was around 10% (Figure 1d) on gross pathology, a few dark red and raised areas were seen in the lungs of some animals and were consistent with mild pulmonary consolidation. 0 0 0 0 0 0 1.5 (1\u20132) 0/4 8 3 100% (16/16) 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.5 (0\u20131) 0/4 8 7 100% (12/12) 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.3 (0\u20131) 1 (1/12) 0 (0\u20132) 0/4 8 3 50% (3/6) 2 (2\u20133) 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 (2/6) 0 0/4 8 4 100% (3/3) 2 (2\u20133) 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 (2/3) 2 (0\u20132) 0/4 8 1 100% (20/20) 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Virus titers in nasal swabs demonstrate highest titers for pH1N1, intermediate titers for H3N2 and lowest titers for H5N1. on 4 dpi comparable titers for pH1N1 and H5N1 and lower titers for H3N2 and lower titers for H3N2. flu virus antigen expression was visible as diffuse to granular red staining. antigen expression in the nose was present from 0.5 to 4 dpi. no antigen expression was seen in the tracheal, bronchial, bronchiolar, and tracheo-bronchial glandular epithelium at any time point. antigen expression and histopathology of nasal respiratory epithelium of ferrets inoculated with different influenza viruses. there is high antigen expression with associated lesions characterized by neutrophilic rhinitis in the olfactory epithelium of ferrets inoculated with pH1N1 on 1 and 4 dpi. there is high antigen expression with associated lesions characterized by bronchiolitis in bronchiolar epithelium of ferrets inoculated with different influenza viruses. for H5N1 there was no expression on 1 dpi and moderate antigen expression with associated lesions on 4 dpi.

peak of neutrophils in the alveoli on 0.5 dpi followed by a dip and a response of myelopoiesis in the blood. the high demand for neutrophils in the alveoli is not followed by higher release of neutrophils in the blood. viral excretion of H3N2 could be directly estimated based on viral production scores in the nose and trachea. this suggests that these regions were the main sources of excreted virus. the trachea-bronchial lymph nodes were enlarged from 0.5 to 7 dpi. there was a mild to severe multifocal rhinitis and bronchiolitis. the trachea-bronchial lymph nodes were enlarged from 0.5 to 7 dpi, with a peak on 7 dpi. the tracheo-bronchial lymph nodes and tonsils demonstrated lymphadenopathy. in the palatine roof of two animals there was severe inflammation and necrosis of the sero-mucous glands. on 0.5 dpi there was infiltration of neutrophils in the bronchiolar epithelium and lumen with mild peribronchiolar cuffing. on 1 dpi the number of neutrophils increased with necrosis of the epithelium, intraluminal cellular debris and peribronchiolar cuffing. on 2 dpi the necrosis was more severe than on 1 dpi. the high values decreased after 1 dpi consistent with the severe damage of the epithelium. the tracheo-bronchial lymph nodes and tonsils did not express virus antigen. there was no virus antigen expression in extra-respiratory tissues. on 14 dpi, the numbers of neutrophils and mononuclear cells were decreased in both the blood and the alveoli. excretion of pH1N1 was a positive linear function of viral production in the upper regions of the respiratory tract (nose and trachea) as a significant predictor. by gross pathology, there was multifocal pulmonary consolidation on 0.5 dpi. on 1 dpi, there was fluid in the bronchi and lung parenchyma. on 2 dpi, the percentage of affected lung tissue had increased dramatically to almost 60%. antigen expression in the trachea was present from 0.5 to 3 dpi. antigen expression in the alveoli was present in type II pneumocytes and less in type I pneumocytes and alveolar macrophages. virus titers on 1 dpi were higher than expected based on virus antigen expression in the nose. this could be due to slower replication on 0.5 dpi and necrosis of virus-replicating cells on 4 dpi. highest virus titers were seen on 2 dpi in olfactory bulb and jejunum. viral production and damage in the deeper regions of the

Orion Pharma, Espoo Finland) after inoculation, the ferrets were monitored daily for clinical signs until maximum 14 dpi. the animals were predestined to be sacrificed at 12 hours (0.5 day), 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 and 14 dpi (for H5N1 not at 7 and 14 dpi) pH1N1 (A/Netherlands/602/2009), H5N1 (A/Indonesia/02/2005) and Aleutian disease virus were maintained in standard housing. animals were anesthetized with ketamine and medetomidine hydrochloride. temperature logger (DST micro-T ultra small temperature logger; Star-Oddi, Reykjavik, Iceland) recorded the body temperature of the animals every 10 min. four animals per time point were euthanized by exsanguination under ketamine/medetomidine anesthesia at 12 hours (0.5 day), 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 or 14 dpi. the trachea was clamped off to prevent the lungs from deflating upon opening the thoracic cavity, allowing visual estimation of the area of affected lung parenchyma. four slides with longitudinal section or cross-section of cranial or caudal lobes per animal were performed on every slide. for the extent of alveolitis, bronchiolitis, bronchitis, and tracheitis we scored: 0, no inflammatory cells; 1, few inflammatory cells; 2, moderate numbers of inflammatory cells; 3, many inflammatory cells. s were identified on the basis of their morphology and location. large, oval to round cells with a distinct cell border, foamy cytoplasm and large, oval to bean-shaped nucleus were located in the alveolar lumen separate from the alveolar wall. a cat infected experimentally with H5N1 was used as positive control. the images were 1024768 pixels with 0.455 m per pixel. the percentage of air-containing space present in the pulmonary tissue was calculated as 100%. the quantity of virus replication was calculated either as the percentage of antigen expression (red staining) relative to quantity of tissue (blue staining) total leucocyte counts were determined in blood collected in EDTA Vacutainer tubes. blood was stained with may-Gr\u00fcnwald-Giemsa (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) generalized linear models were used to determine the most appropriate predictors of viral excretion for each virus based on viral production and damage in the respiratory tract. the results were considered significant when P0.05. three viruses were used: seasonal H3N2 virus (A/Netherlands/177/2008), isolated from a patient during the 2008 influenza season [34] and pandemic 2009 virus (pH1N1) (A/Netherlands/602/2009), isolated from a specimen of a human patient who had recently visited Mexico during the pandemic in 2009 [35]. the virus was chosen as a representative virus from a recent seasonal H3N2 influenza epidemic. the cells were grown up to a monolayer of 80 to 90% in two 75 cm2 flasks (A and B) the cells were incubated for 2 days at 37\u00b0C. to mimic cellular damage in MDCK cells during virus infection we aimed to reach a cytopathic effect (CPE) of 75%. ferrets received atipamezole hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg Antisedan;
