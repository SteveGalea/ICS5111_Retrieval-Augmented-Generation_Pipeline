{"summary": "viral aetiology in adult patients with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) admitted to sentinel surveillance institutions in 2012. microarray molecular techniques for viral identification were used on nasopharyngeal samples of adult patients submitted to the surveillance system. results Viral identification was achieved for 63 patients (69.2%) countries have developed surveillance systems by following cases of influenza-like illness and severe acute respiratory infections. the main aims of surveillance have been to provide information on circulating viruses and the susceptibility of Influenza to available antivirals. the true impact of viral infections in the aetiology of acute respiratory disease requiring hospitalization is unknown. study was performed in bogot\u00e1 in 2012 to determine the prevalence of viruses in adult patients with SARI of less than 15 days of evolution using a microarray technique. inclusion criteria consisted of patients over 18 years of age who provided a respiratory sample in 2012 at one of the hospitals performing sentinel surveillance. 117 respiratory samples were needed for a prevalence of 25%, with the poorest accepted result of 20%, 90% power and a 95% confidence level. 117 respiratory samples were needed for a prevalence of 25%, with the poorest accepted result of 20%, 90% power and a 95% confidence level. a microarray diagnostic assay was used to identify the viruses involved. virus subtype 229E and Bocavirus amplifies specific fragments of the viral genome via a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or via a PCR with hybridisation detection using specific capture probes. variables were collected from the patients\u2019 medical histories according to international definitions. institutions that identified viral antigens performed and interpreted these tests in their hospitals. a viral co-infection diagnosis was made when 2 or more different viruses were identified in the same sample. a viral co-infection diagnosis was made when 2 or more different viruses were identified. the samples were sent via nasopharyngeal aspiration or swab. they were stored between 4 and 8\u00b0C in refrigerators intended for this purpose. a cross-sectional study was performed in bogot\u00e1 in 2012. a waiver of informed written and oral consent was sought from each of the ethics and research committees. the waiver was granted by each of the ethics and research committees. a total of 288 nasopharyngeal aspiration or swab samples were taken during 2012. the kit amplifies specific fragments of the viral genome via a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or via a PCR with hybridisation detection using specific capture probes. variables were collected from the patients\u2019 medical histories according to international definitions. thrombocytopenia (platelets under 100,000), thrombocytopenia (platelets under 100,000), an Arterial Oxygen Partial Pressure to Fractional Inspired Oxygen Ratio (PaO2/FiO2) ratio, multilobar compromise, impaired consciousness, leukopenia (under 4,000) and BUN over 20 mg/dl [9] were also considered when the systolic arterial pressure was below 90 mmHg. these histories were obtained from 7 Bogota hospitals in 2012. 45 (45.5%) were from the San Rafael University Hospital Clinic, 23 (23%) were from Fundaci\u00f3n CardioInfantil, 10 (10%) were from Suba Hospital, 9 (9.1%) were from El Tunal Hospital, 6 (6%) were from Santa Clara Hospital, 3 (3%) were from San Ignacio University Hospital, and 3 (3%) were from the Occidente de Kennedy Hospital. a score of 1 was observed in 15 patients (39.5%), a score of 2 was observed in 7 patients (18.4%) and a score of 3 was observed in 3 patients (7.9%). hyponatraemia was detected in 21 (23.1%) patients, 11 (12.1%) patients presented moderate oxygenation impairment, and 20 (22%) patients presented severe oxygenation impairment. 82 (90.1%) were treated with antibiotics; patients received between 1 and 7 antibiotics, with an average of 2.3 antibiotics per patient. beta-lactam group was the most frequently used. 1 patient had Bocavirus, Coronavirus and Influenza; 1 had Bocavirus, Influenza and Adenovirus; 1 had Bocavirus, Influenza and Rhinovirus; 1 had Adenovirus, parainfluenza (PIV 3) and RSV; and 1 had Adenovirus, Influenza and Parainfluenza (PIV 1). there were 19 patients infected with 2 viruses, with co-infection of Bocavirus and Influenza in 6 patients being the most frequent diabetes was detected in 4.8% of patients with viral detection. a virus was identified in 28 patients (73.7%) of patients with pneumonia. no significant differences were observed between the groups with and without viral detection. more than one microorganism was identified in 4 cases each. positive Gram staining was more frequent among patients with COPD (41% vs. 18.8%, P = 0.03) colonisation of the airways was also more frequent in these patients. outcome occurred among 7 patients (29.2%) without viral identification and 23 patients (36.5%) with viral identification. average length of mechanical ventilation was 7 days, with a minimum of 1 day and a maximum of 20 days. Bocavirus was isolated in 5 (all cases of Influenza A), Metapneumovirus was isolated in 3 and RSV was isolated in 1. death occurred in 14.3% of those in whom Influenza was identified, 50% of those in whom Metapneumovirus was identified and 20% of those in whom RSV was identified. 1 had Bocavirus, Influenza and Adenovirus; 1 had Bocavirus, Influenza and Rhinovirus; 1 had Adenovirus, Influenza and Parainfluenza (PIV 3); 1 had Adenovirus, parainfluenza (PIV 3) and RSV; and 1 had Adenovirus, Influenza and Parainfluenza (PIV 1). there were 19 patients infected with 2 viruses, with co-infection of Bocavirus and Influenza diabetes was detected in 4.8% of patients with viral detection. severe pneumonia was diagnosed in 62.5% of patients without viral detection. no significant differences were observed between groups with and without viral detection. more than one microorganism was identified in 4 cases each. positive Gram staining was more frequent among patients with COPD. colonisation of the airways was also more frequent in these patients. the average length of mechanical ventilation was 7 days, with a minimum of 1 day and a maximum of 20 days. 3 patients had unsuitable samples or non-amplified PCR results. one case with viral identification was readmitted to the unit with an identification of Influenza subtype AH1N1. death occurred in 14.3% of those in whom Influenza was identified. 50% of those in whom Metapneumovirus was identified and 20% of those in whom RSV was identified. fewer patients had only one virus detected. the CURB-65 index of pneumonia was not useful, as only 10 (26%) scored for general hospitalization and none for ICUs using these criteria. this finding contrasts with the high number of our patients who required ICU care. the application of these scales in non-Influenza viral pneumonia has yet to be assessed. this pattern shows the importance of epidemiological surveillance, especially during the rainy season in countries at these latitudes. techniques based on identifying nucleic acids can obtain more rapid and precise results for diagnosing viral infections. there is limited information on the diagnostic utility of these new tests. the study was multicentre in design, but the information was gathered from only one city in Colombia. it was not possible to control viral and bacterial sampling, and there was limited access to relevant data such as previous Influenza or pneumococcal vaccination history."}
