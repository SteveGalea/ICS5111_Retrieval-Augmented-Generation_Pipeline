{"summary": "nanoparticles are increasingly being studied as drug-carrying and targeting tools. we have previously reported on a scheme to produce protein-based self-assembling nanoparticles that can act as antigen display platforms. we tried to use the same system for cancer-targeting, making use of a C-terminal bombesin peptide that has high affinity for a receptor known to be overexpressed in certain tumors. nanoparticles can be safely used as a vaccine platform without the risk of prolonged side effects. it is assumed that nanoparticles would bring about a better target to non-target ratio of drug uptake in drug delivery approaches. coiled-coil domains are building blocks to engineer self-assembling protein nanoparticles. bombesin was selected because it is known to have a high affinity to the GRP receptor, which is over-expressed in many tumors. the free bombesin peptide was selected because it is known to have a high affinity to the GRP receptor. nanoparticles are known to be trapped in the reticuloendothelial system (RES) mainly in the liver like the labeled colloids. this elimination from the blood stream hampers the uptake into other target tissues. we also introduced poly(ethylene glycol) coated particles. biodistribution was assessed in a mouse model. the lysine side chain in P6c is located between two bulky tryptophan residues. in the P6c-PbK peptide the lysine coupling site was engineered to the C-terminus at the very end of a peptide surface modification that previously produced very nice nanoparticles. 20 P6c-PbK-PEG/P6c-BN 40:20 3 0 50 0 10

number and location of the PEG molecules from the SDS-PAGE analysis. it is also difficult to detect a difference in the coupling efficiency between the two peptide chains. radiolabeling The labeling procedure with the carbonyl method was not optimized and yielded up to 80 % of labeled particles. the labeled particles were stable for at least one day, corresponding to four half live times of 99mTc. in vitro properties The biodistribution showed high uptake in the liver and the spleen. 6c-BN 50:10 decreases strongly from 21% ID/g (at 1 h) to 9% ID/g (at 24 h) the reason is the variable weight of the spleen. only in most experiments animals with light and heavy spleens were uniformly distributed among the type of particles and time points. 0.14(1) Heart 0.16(4) 0.13(2) 0.09(4)

attached to P6c or P6c-PbK. both P6c and P6c-PbK peptides have two primary amine groups. in the P6c-PbK peptide the lysine coupling site was engineered to the C-terminus at the very end of a peptide surface modification. it was moved from a less exposed site on the N-terminus to a well-exposed site on the C-terminus. it was expected that in the P6c-PbK design the coupling efficiency is higher. hydroxylsuccinimide (NHS) functional group reacts with the primary amine groups in the peptides. the unPEGylated (lane E) and the P6c-PbK PEGylation (lane F) products showed similar results. the extra band ran slightly above the P6c monomer band after PEGylation. stepwise procedure, dynamic light scattering showed a size distribution with a peak of about 35 nm. all 3 PEGylated samples had size distributions with surprisingly similar peak diameters. it is also apparent that PEGylation led to staining artifacts in the image. in vivo properties The biodistribution showed high uptake in the liver and the spleen, which was quite similar at 1 h and 4 h post injection. 80% ( 10%) of the injected activity was trapped in the liver (Figure 6) concentrations from 60% up to 140% injected dose per g tissue were obtained. specific bombesin mediated uptake would show elevated values of 99mTc activity in the pancreas and the tumor. however, in agreement with the in vitro data this was not observed. uptake in the liver and spleen expressed as % of the injected activity per whole organ at different times after injection. 0.4(3) 0.3(2) 1(1) 1.1(9) 0.12(7) Stomach 0.6(7) 0.26(2) 0.20(3)

size distribution that was not affected by coupling of PEG to the nanoparticles. lower spleen uptake correlates with higher lipophilicity. the uptake in liver, spleen or bone marrow is quite high as would have been expected for protein-based materials. the washout of the activity from liver and spleen can be interpreted as a degradation of the particles, which is well in agreement with the biological function of these organs. peptides P6c [6,8], P6c-PbK and P6c-BN consist of a pentameric coiled-coil domain derived from cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) [27], linked to a trimeric coiled-coil domain that was de novo designed [28,29]. the peptide has a His-tag sequence (22 amino acids, black) and a trimeric domain (46 amino acids) 100 L of the cultures were spread on LB-agar plates containing 100 g/mL ampicillin and 30 g/mL chloramphenicol and left overnight at 37\u00b0C. the following day, 30 mL were used to inoculate 3 L of Luria broth containing 100 g/mL ampicillin and 30 g/mL chloramphenicol. the cells were allowed to grow at 37\u00b0C, under shaking at 180 RPM, until the OD purified peptide was dialyzed into lysis buffer containing increasing concentrations of imidazole. purified peptide was then dialyzed into imidazole-free buffer: 8 M urea, 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA. the mixed peptide solution was then mixed so that the ratio of moles P6c to moles P6c-BN was 50:10. refolding was done by stepwise dialysis into buffers with 20 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol and successively lower urea concentration. labeling with 99mTc was done in two steps. first, 1 ml of [99mTc]pertechnetate was added to a mixture of 4.5 mg sodium boranocarbonate, 2.9 mg borax and 9 mg sodium potassium tartrate. the obtained solution with [Tc(CO)3(H2O)3]+ was cooled to room temperature, neutralized with hydrochloric acid and buffered with phosphate buffer at pH 6\u20137. cells were incubated with the labeled analogues (4 kBq) in culture medium for 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 24 h at 37\u00b0C. nonspecific binding was determined with 10 M unlabeled BN (residues 1\u201314) or unlabeled particles. biodistribution studies were performed with 6- to 8-week-old female nu/nu mice (20\u201325 g) each mouse received subcutaneously 8x106 PC-3 cells in 150 L culture medium without supplements. at 1, 4 and 24 h post injection, the animals were euthanized and dissected. the sequences of P6c, P6c-PbK and P6c-BN were extended at its C-terminal end with a flexible linker (GSGSGSGSGSGS) and nine residues (NQWAVGHLM) from the peptide bombesin. 100 L cultures were spread on LB-agar plates containing 100 g/mL ampicillin and 30 g/mL chloramphenicol. cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (9 M urea, 10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 100 mM NaH2PO4) and lysed by sonication. the lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 30,500xg for 45 minutes. the peptide was then dialyzed into imidazole-free buffer. molar ratio of mPEG-NHS to peptide was about 100:1. reaction mixture was analyzed using MWCO of 6000\u20138000 kDa. peptides P6c and P6c-BN were dialyzed into denaturing buffer. molar ratios with unPEGylated P6c-BN were diluted to approximately 0.1 mg/ml. the 0 M urea step was performed twice to remove residual urea. cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and twice weekly subcultured after detaching with trypsin/EDTA (0.25%). internalization studies For internalization, PC-3 cells at confluence were placed in 6-well plates and left to attach overnight. cells were placed at different concentrations (0.0625 \u2013 2 million cells/well) in 12-well plates. nonspecific binding was determined in presence of 1 mol/l unlabeled bombesin (1\u201314) to detach the cells the cells were washed 2 times with 500 l 1 N NaOH. results are expressed as percentage of injected dose per gram of tissue (%ID/g) competing interests PBu and UA have an interest in the company Alpha-O Peptides."}
