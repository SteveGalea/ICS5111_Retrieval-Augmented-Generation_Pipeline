{"summary": "the burden of stroke is comparatively greater in Asian countries than in the western world. the study examined risk factors, medication use, incidence, and one-year recurrence of stroke in Taiwan over the last decade. one study suggested the incidence of stroke decreased from 1961 to 2000 in Japan [7] and an overview study revealed that recurrent stroke decreased in each decade from 1960 to 2010 [10]. Certainly more nationwide data on the evolving nature and trajectory of stroke in Asia are needed for research and planning purposes. the first-ever ischemic stroke during study period was defined as the index stroke. patients excluded if they had history of any strokes between 1997 and 1999. primary outcome was incidence of ischemic stroke in Taiwan. a prior study validating the diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke in national health insurance claims data using the Taiwan Stroke Registry as a reference revealed a positive predictive value of 88.4% and sensitivity of 97.3% [11]. among confirmed cases of acute ischemic stroke in a hospital medical record, 94.5% were assigned \u2018ischemic stroke\u2019 as the principal diagnosis in the NHIRD. the average age was about 70 years and approximately 58.6% of them were men. more than half of patients had history of hypertension, which was from 59% to 63%. the frequency of hypertension in ischemic stroke was not much different in three time period. hyperlipidemia 58.9 63.4 62.5 0.0001 Diabetes 29.7 33.1 34.0 0.0001 Hyperlipidemia 22.0 34.1 40.7 0.0001 Ischemic Heart Disease 24.2 28.9 28.5 0.0001 Atrial Fibrillation 7.3 8.9 10.3 0.0001 Chronic Kidney Disease 4.0 4.5 5.0 0.0001 Heart Failure 7.3 8.8 9.4 0.0001 30 day in\u2013hospital mortality (%) 1.7 1.6 1.9 0.0001 Medications Calcium channel ischemic stroke patients received antiplatelet were 76.1% in 2000-2003, 85.3% in 2004-2007 and 86.6% in 2008-2011 respectively. incidence rate of ischemic stroke decreased gradually from 2000 (142.3 per 100,000 persons) to 2011 (129.5 per 100,000 persons) except there was an obvious drop in 2003 then increased in 2004 (Figure 1). recurrence of first-ever ischemic stroke using the entire population of Taiwan from 2000 to 2011. we used stroke hospitalization to represent incidence and recurrence of ischemic stroke. however, a very small proportion of patients may not be hospitalized due to various reasons. study included only first-ever ischemic stroke, prior study also included 34% recurrent ischemic stroke patients. mortality rate was lower in this study, as compared to prior stroke registry study (1.9% vs. 4% [15]. study had similar frequencies of stroke risk factors except 10% patients had atrial fibrillation in this study. ischemic stroke patients with atrial fibrillation typically relied on a single baseline 12-lead electrocardiogram or history of atrial fibrillation in this study. the annual incidence and one-year recurrence rates of stroke declined over the last decade in Taiwan. however, it would seem that the magnitude of reduction for incident stroke seen in Western nations of approximately 20% was much greater than the more modest 9% decrease noted in Taiwan."}
