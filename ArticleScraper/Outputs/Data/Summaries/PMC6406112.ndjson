{"summary": "PDCoV has the smallest genome in the known coronaviruses. it causes acute diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, and mortality in neonatal piglets. PDCoV has been reported in the united states, china, south Korea, laos, Vietnam, Thailand, Canada, and Japan (5 \u2013 7). the number of amplified DNA fragments was 1 amplicon per primer set. the total viral RNA was reverse transcribed with oligo(dT) primer. the total viral RNA was reverse transcribed with oligo(dT) primer. 4741-F CTCCTGTACAGGCCTTACAA 1,680 4741\u20136420 55 PDCoV-6420-R TCACACGTATAGCCTGCTGAA 1,680 4741\u20136420 55 PDCoV-6291-F CTCAATGCAGAAGACCAGTC 1,751 6291\u20138041 53 PDCoV-7920-F GGTACTGCTTCTGATAAGGAT 1,741 7920\u20139660 53 PDCoV the genomic sequence of the PDCoV strain CH-01 was identified as having 25,404 nucleotides (nt) the PDCoV strain HNZK-02 was identified as being 25,419 nt in length, excluding the 3-poly(A tail) the PDCoV strain HNZK-02 contained an 18,803-nt ORF1a/1b, which had a 6-nt and 9-nt insert at nucleotide positions 1739 and 2804 respectively. the other genes in strain HNZK-02 had the same sizes as those of the PDCoV CH-01 strain."}
