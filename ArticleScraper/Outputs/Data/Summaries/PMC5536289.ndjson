{"summary": "middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus is a contagious respiratory pathogen that is contracted via close contact with an infected subject. transmission of the pathogen has occurred through animal-to-human contact at first followed by human-to-human contact within families and health care facilities. the disease appears to have been transmitted from camels to humans. recent studies have revealed an association among the virus found in humans with that found in camels. in 2012, dozens of cases of people infected with the disease were reported in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) most MERS-CoV cases reported have acquired infection through human-to-human transmission. most acquired infection in health-care settings (63.2%), followed by those infected in household settings (13.7%). it is a matter of urgent to examine the likelihood of fatality as result of the disease. the results and discussion of the findings are presented in section 4 and 5 respectively. findings will help public health practitioners, policy makers and program managers monitor and design intervention strategies aimed at minimizing deaths due to the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus. risk factors category % Dead 2 p value Gender Male (65.7%) 28% 0.0259 Female (32.6%) 36% NA (1.8%) Comorbidity Present (52.7%) 46.7% 0.0001 Absent(47.3%) 17.1% 0.0001 One (14.8%) 14.8% More than one (37.9%) 49.0% Animal Contact Yes (8.9%) 38.8% 0.2215 No (91.1%) 32.3% Camel Contact Yes (7%) 37.3% 0.4228 No (93%) 32.5% the percentages were calculated based on the number of deaths within each category. for example, 36% of infected females died of the disease. chi-square test measures how \u201cclose\u201d the observed values are to those expected. p-values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant in all tests. geoadditive Bayesian models have been used in several studies. age, fgeo(si) is the geographical effect, and is a vector of fixed effect parameters for the categorical covariates. the predictor will be of the form i = 1 Comorbidity +... + 7 Clinical + f1(age) + fgeo(region) we also included an interaction term between comorbidity and age. the j are unknown regression coefficients that can be defined to follow random walks smoothness j = 2j1 j2 + uj with Gaussian errors u j N ( 0, j 2 ). the smoothness of f is control by the variance parameter j 2, which is also considered as a random variable and a highly dispersed inverse gamma prior assumed for the variance, j 2 I G ( a j, b j ). the posterior odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated using BayesX version 2.1 [39, 40]. data sources This study was based on a retrospective data on the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus outbreak in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) between June 6, 2012 and July 17, 2015. risk factors category % Dead 2 p value Gender Male (65.7%) 28% 0.0259 Female (32.6%) 36% NA (1.8%) Comorbidity Present (52.7%) 46.7% 0.0001 Absent(47.3%) 17.1% 0.0001 One (14.8%) 14.8% More than one (37.9%) 49.0% Animal Contact Yes (8.9%) 38.8% 0.2215 No (91.1%) 32.3% Camel Contact Yes (7%) 37.3% 0.4228 No (93%) 32.5% the percentages were calculated based on the number of deaths within each category. for example, 36% of infected females died of the disease. we present the frequency of risk factors and survival status as percentages of deaths within each category. in all analyses, p-values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant in all tests. based on the framework of structured additive regression model. the predictor will be of the form i = 1 Comorbidity +... + 7 Clinical + f1(age) + fgeo(region) we also included an interaction term between comorbidity and age. the aim was to examine how comorbidity varies smoothly across age. the j are unknown regression coefficients that can be defined to follow a random walks smoothness j = 2j1 j2 + uj with Gaussian errors u j N ( 0, j 2 ). the smoothness of f is control by the variance parameter j 2, which is also considered as a random variable and a highly dispersed inverse gamma prior assumed for the variance, j 2 I G ( a j, b j ). 959 MERS cases were recorded in KSA during the study period with 317 (33%) deaths while 67 (7%) had contact with camels or camel products. 126 (13%) were health-care workers and 52.7% had some kind of comorbidity (Table 1). not all of the comorbidities were equally prevalent. patients who died of the disease were more likely to have one or more comorbidities with an odd ratios of 3.4 and 4.7 respectively. most of the MERS cases occurred in Ar Riyad (38%) and Makkah (34%) provinces. p value 0.0001) and the area of aseer and Jizan as primary cluster for low rates (RR = 0.093, p value 0.0001). Al Jawf, Riyadh and Hail were secondary cluster for low rates. ERS-CoV patients with red shading were less likely to have suffered mortality due to MERS-CoV but mortality was higher as the shading moves towards green colour. this implies evidence of significant geographical variation and clustering of mortality from MERS-CoV with lower risk (afteradjusting for other variables) occurring in Riyadh, Ar\u2019ar, Al Jawf and Jizan. about 3 out of every 10 males died of MERS disease, compared to 28% of the females. the percentage of health-care workers that died of MERS (8.73%) were much less than non-health care workers (36.5%), while 46.14% of persons with comorbidity died of MERS compared with 17.05% of those without comorbidity. the proportion of health-care workers who died of MERS-CoV were smaller than the proportion of non-health-care works who died of the disease. the horizontal axis represents the number of MERS cases in the 13 regions of Saudi Arabia. Fig 3 shows the estimated effects of age (a) and the estimated effects of comorbidity as it varies smoothly over age (interaction between comorbidity and age) individuals aged 25 years or younger who suffered from MERS-CoV were less likely to have suffered mortality. however, the odds of dying from the disease tended to increase as age increased beyond 25 years. health-care workers were 37% less likely to die from the viral infection compared to non-health care workers. a number of studies have looked at the epidemiological pattern of the infection among the community. however, very few have looked at the pattern of deaths among those who are afflicted by the viral disease. study only looked at 47 patients with MERS-CoV (28 deaths) patients who died of MERS-CoV were three times more likely to have one or more comorbidities (OR: 3.4) and almost 5 times more likely to have 2 or more comorbidities (OR: 4.7), compared to patients without any underlying comorbidities. this is a significant finding as it further exposes the negative combined influence of comorbidities on survival. study by assiri et al., [12] and Mackay et al., [13] showed that more than 50% of people older than 50 years have diabetes. but the large number of people with MERS-CoV infection might have been due to the hospital outbreak where patients were first admitted. treat and prevent multiple comorbidities, particularly within the aging population, in order to lessen the risk of death."}
