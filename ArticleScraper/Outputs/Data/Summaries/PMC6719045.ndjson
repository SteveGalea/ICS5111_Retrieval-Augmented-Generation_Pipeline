{"summary": "interferon-induced transmembrane protein (IFITM) genes are highly conserved between vertebrates. they block entry of several viruses into target cells [1,2,3,4]. amini-Bavil-Olyaee and colleagues suggested that this might be due to IFITM-dependent alteration of intracellular cholesterol transport. membrane association of IFITM proteins is facilitated by intramembrane domain 1 (IM1) [26], which is palmitoylated, and this modification is required for restriction of viruses [27,28,29]. mutation of residues was compatible with normal IFITM3 localization and IFITM3/IFITM3 interactions, indicating that F75 and F78 are important for antiviral activity. eCFP/eYFP fusion proteins were efficiently expressed in transfected 293T cells. expression levels were similar for all fusion proteins with exception of SxFP-Lyn, which showed reduced expression levels. both SxFP-NM and SxFP-Lyn showed plasma membrane staining with some intracellular staining. fusion protein SYFP-SCFP exhibited diffuse staining in the cytoplasm with strong accumulation in the nucleus. analysis of the proteins in the FACS-FRET assay revealed no signal upon coexpression of unmodified SCFP and SYFP while fusing both proteins resulted in a strong signal. coexpression of SCFP and SYFP harboring different membrane targeting domains resulted in FRET when combinations of neuromodulin and Lyn membrane targeting signals were tested. Western blot analysis of transfected 293T cells revealed that all fusion proteins were robustly expressed. expression of IFITM5-based fusion proteins was slightly reduced compared to that of the other IFITM proteins studied. similar results were obtained in cells engineered to stably express IFITM1-3 and the respective SCFP/SYFP fusion proteins. reduced availability of the acceptor (in this case SYFP-IFITM5) results in reduced FRET-efficiency [43]. all FRET signals were more robust than those observed for SCFP/SYFP artificially targeted to membranes. 293T cells were transiently transfected with the indicated plasmid combinations. controls are not shown but were similar to those shown in Figure 1D. results of a single experiment performed with triplicate samples are shown. these observations are in keeping with known differences in cellular localization of IFITM1 and IFITM3. the data suggest that subtle differences in membrane localization and/or interactions between IFITM proteins can be more readily visualized when low amounts of plasmids are transfected. the data indicate that IFITM3 is more likely to form homooligomers than heterooligomers with IFITM1. 293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding the indicated IFITM3 fusion proteins. protein expression was analyzed by Western blot using anti-GFP and anti-IFITM3 antibodies. similar results were obtained in two separate experiments. the results of a representative experiment performed with triplicate samples indicate SD. the strong FRET signal observed upon coexpression of IFITM3-wt and mutant IFITM-FF raised the question whether the assay employed was sufficiently sensitive to detect potentially altered membrane localization of IFITM3 variants and/or altered protein\u2013protein interactions. F75 and F78 are Dispensable for IFITM3-IFITM3 interactions. residues F75 and F78 are dispensable for the formation of IFITM3 homooligomers. this is determined by co-immunoprecipitation. this finding was in-line with the FRET results. F75 and F78 are neither required for adequate membrane targeting of IFITM3 nor for IFITM3/IFITM3 interactions. 293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding IFITM3-wt, IFITM3-FF or IFITM3-43AS. eCFP/enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP) has certain disadvantages such as residual dimerization capabilities. we based our analysis on the improved FRET pair super cyan fluorescent protein (SCFP) and super yellow fluorescent protein (SYFP) [35] to overcome limitations associated with the standard eCFP/eYFP combination. the presence of membrane targeting domains resulted in pronounced membrane localization of the modified proteins relative to unmodified SCFP and SYFP. fusion protein SYFP-SCFP exhibited diffuse staining in the cytoplasm with strong accumulation in the nucleus. analysis of the proteins in the FACS-FRET assay revealed no signal upon coexpression of unmodified SCFP and SYFP while fusing both proteins resulted in a strong signal. coexpression of SCFP and SYFP harboring different membrane targeting domains resulted in FRET when combinations of neuromodulin and Lyn membrane targeting signals were tested. Western blot analysis of transfected 293T cells revealed all fusion proteins were robustly expressed. expression of IFITM5-based fusion proteins was slightly reduced compared to that of the other IFITM proteins studied. similar results were obtained in cells engineered to stably express IFITM1-3 and the respective SCFP/SYFP fusion proteins. FP yielded low FRET signals (Figure 2C, Supplementary Figure S3). all FRET signals were more robust than those observed for SCFP/SYFP artificially targeted to membranes. signal augmentation due to real protein\u2013protein interactions at cellular membranes. 293T cells were transiently transfected with the indicated plasmid combinations. controls are not shown but were similar to those shown in Figure 1D. results of a single experiment performed with triplicate samples are shown. eliciting a FRET signal when the lowest amount of plasmid was transfected. these observations are in keeping with known differences in cellular localization of IFITM1 and IFITM3. the data suggest that subtle differences in membrane localization and/or interactions between IFITM proteins can be more readily visualized when low amounts of plasmids are transfected. 293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding the indicated IFITM3 fusion proteins. protein expression was analyzed by Western blot, using anti-GFP and anti-IFITM3 antibodies. similar results were obtained in two separate experiments. FRET analysis of 293T cells transfected with the indicated plasmid combinations at 48 h post transfection. similar results were obtained in a separate experiment. the strong FRET signal observed upon coexpression of IFITM3-wt and mutant IFITM-FF raised the question. F75 and F78 are Dispensable for IFITM3-IFITM3 interactions. residues F75 and F78 are dispensable for the formation of IFITM3 homooligomers. this finding was in-line with the FRET results. F75 and F78 were dispensable for interactions with IFITM3-wt and IFITM-FF. this contrasts with published data but is in keeping with the FRET analysis discussed above. we show that IFITM3-wt and IFITM3 with mutated F75 and F78 induce robust FRET signals and physically interact. we first asked whether FRET signals in our assay depend on protein\u2013protein interactions or whether targeting of two non-interacting proteins can be sufficient for FRET. the latter was case: SCFP and SYFP did not elicit FRET signals when expressed in the cytosol while FRET was observed when both proteins were targeted to the plasma membrane. previous work found that amino acid residues in IM1 and a conserved intracellular loop (CIL) are important for antiviral activity. the lack of antiviral activity of IFITM3 with mutated F75 and F78 may stem from altered membrane localization of the mutant relative to the wt protein or abrogated IFITM3/IFITM3 interactions. cell culture HEK 293T cells (DSMZ ACC 635) and HeLa cells (ATCC CCL-2) were maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) all cell culture media were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 g/mL streptomycin. pSYFP2-C1 and pSYFP-N1 were exchanging ageI/BsrGI fragments encoding fluorescent protein sequences in pEYFP-C1 or pEYFP-N1. to generate a FRET positive control, a SmaI and XbaI SCFP-Fragment from pSCFP-N1 was ligated to pSYFP2-C1 digested with Ecl136II Plasmids encoding IFITM1-3 and 5 fused to SCFP3A or SYFP2 were generated by subcloning the coding sequences as NotI/EcoRI fragments from pCAGGS-IFITM1-3 [51] into pSCFP3A-C1 or pSYFP2-C-Ger. the coding sequences were amplified with primers EIF3-5Esp and SV40pAseq digested 75AF78A-rev and mut-IFITM3-F75AF78A-for/pCAGGS-3\u2032 were cloned into pQCXIP. mutant genes IFITM3-43AS and IFITM3-FF were subcloned into pcDNA3-myc1 or pSYFP2-IFITM1. hIFITM5-5Not 5\u2032-CCGCGGCCGCACCATGGACACGCGCG-3\u2032, hIFITM5-i3 5\u2032-ACCACCTTCTCTGATCGGGCCTTGATGGCCAG-3\u2032, hIFITM5-3Eco 5\u2032-CGAATTCTCAGTCTCGGGCCTTGAT-3\u2032, hIFITM5-3Eco 5\u2032-CGAATTCTCAGTCATAGTCCGCGTCATCAAAC-3 mut-IFITM3-F75AF78A-rev 5\u2032-CCCTGCTGCTATGGCGCCCAGGCAGCAGGG-3\u2032, mut-IFITM3-F75AF78A-rev 5\u2032-CCCTGCTGCTATGGCGCCCAGGCAGCAGGG-3\u2032, pCAGGS-3\u2032 5\u2032- pCAGGS-3\u2032 5\u2032- CAGAAGTCAGGG-3\u2032 4.4. thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA), anti-mouse Alexafluor546 (1:1000, Thermo Fisher) followed for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. images were taken on a confocal microscope using oil plan-Apochromat objectives. cells were cotransfected with plasmids MLV gag-pol (3 g) and MLV luc (6 g) and a plasmid encoding a viral glycoprotein (3 g) the next day, cells were cotransfected with plasmids MLV gag-pol (3 g) and a plasmid encoding IFITM or a control gene (CAT, 6 g) cell lysed in 500 L CoIP-buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 150mM NaCl, 0.5% CHAPSO) for precipitation, 1 L (per sample) mouse-anti-FLAG (M2) was reacted for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C with Protein A/G PLUS-Agarose. samples were incubated on a rotator at room temperature for 30 min. cells were excited with the 405 nm laser and fluorescence was collected in the SCFP channel with a standard 450/40 filter. to measure the SYFP signal, cells were excited with the 488 nm laser and emission was also collected with a 530/30 filter. cell lines were obtained from collaborators, and the identity of the human cell lines was verified by STR typing [48] human IFITM5 was assembled from individual exons by splice-overlap PCR using primers hIFITM5-5Not, hIFITM5-i3, hIFITM5-i5, hIFITM5-3Eco and cloned into plasmid pQCXIP-mcs via NotI and EcoRI. to generate a FRET positive control, a SmaI and XbaI SCFP- the phosphorylated oligonucleotides Mem-AccAge-for and Mem-AccAge-rev were ligated into pSCFP3A-N1 or pSYFP2-N1 digested with Acc65I and AgeI. for fusion of the Lyn membrane targeting signal to the N-terminus of the fluorescent proteins, SCFP3A or SYFP2 were amplified using primers Myr-Pal-GFP-5 IFITM3-FF mutant was generated by overlap-extension PCR using pCAGGS-IFITM3 [51] as template and primer pairs IFITM3-5N/mut-IFITM3-F75AF78A-rev and mut-IFITM3-F75AF78A-for/pCAGGS-3\u2032. pcDNA3-myc1 contains start codon and myc-epitope coding sequences inserted into HindIII and mutant genes IFITM3-43AS and IFITM3-FF were inserted into pcDNA3-myc1 and pcDNA3-3xFLAG as Acc65I and BamHI sites fragments from the respective pQCXIP-plasmids. the integrity of all constructs was confirmed by automated sequencing. anti-GFP polyclonal serum (BioVision, Milpitas, CA, USA) was used for immunoblot at 1:500 dilution.
