{"summary": "single births with nonmissing information on gestation length yield a sample of 1,435,213 births. the fraction of white mothers is lower in the regional sample, but the other maternal and birth characteristics look fairly similar to those in the full sample of US births. controlling for a broad set of observable mother and birth characteristics weakens the seasonality in mothers' socioeconomic status. however, a significant pattern remains in all cases (equality of month effects rejected with P 0.001 in each regression). this finding indicates that inclusion of even detailed observables is not sufficient to control for confounding because of selection into conception months. within-mother comparisons effectively control for selection into conception months. if mothers have a preference for certain conception months, then one would expect seasonality in these characteristics to remain. however, within-mother comparisons eliminate seasonality in these characteristics. the average gestation length decreases significantly by 0.8 wk (P 0.001) during the first 5 mo of the year and returns to the January level in June. this finding indicates that the seasonal pattern in gestation length is not driven by mothers of different socioeconomic backgrounds selecting differently into conception months. the decrease in gestation length by 0.8 wk leads to an increase in premature births of about 1 percentage point. Fig. 3 shows exactly this pattern: infants conceived in February to May had shorter gestations in 2009. seasonal effect is 1.5 times as large in 2009 as in other years. trough is shifted to February/March. birth weight, pregnancy weight gain, and prepregnancy weight by month of conception are displayed. negative weight gain is coded as zero weight gain in the new jersey and new york city data. the seasonal pattern in gestation does not serve as an explanation for the higher birth weights of summer conceptions. nutrition during pregnancy can be proxied by maternal weight gain during pregnancy. from January to June, average weight gain increases by about 0.8 lb. we find strong seasonality in two central birth outcomes. gestation length is lower for conceptions during the first months of the year. birth weight is hump-shaped over the year, with the highest average weight for summer conceptions. some mechanisms have been proposed for explaining seasonality in birth and later outcomes (4). these include seasonal variation in viral infections (29), seasonal allergies (31), pollution levels (24, 32, 33), eating patterns (24, 32, 33), temperature (6, 27, 34) and early fetal loss (9). we find a strong and negative correlation of influenza with gestation length. the estimated correlation coefficient of 0.71 is even more notable given the discontinuous monthly pattern in both variables. this finding provides the strongest evidence to date that seasonal influenza might be a driver of the seasonality in gestation length. influenza is known to cause premature labor, but these infants are at higher risk of short gestation. flu shots may be effective in fighting seasonal deterioration in length of gestation. our results may have some implications for public policy. the influenza data used in this study are collected by the Center for Disease Control's US Outpatient Influenza-Like Illness Surveillance Network. each week, 1,800 outpatient healthcare providers report data to the Center for Disease Control on the total number of patients seen and the number of those patients with influenza-like illness. the standard influenza measure derived from these data is the fraction of patients in reporting healthcare centers diagnosed with ILI. the inclusion of mother indicators in Eq. 3 (so-called mother fixed effects) is equivalent to differencing all equation variables within different births of the same mother (42). this procedure controls for any characteristics of the mother that are constant over time. the influenza data used in this study are collected by the Center for Disease Control's US Outpatient Influenza-Like Illness Surveillance Network. each week, 1,800 outpatient healthcare providers report data to the center for disease control on the total number of patients seen and the number of those patients with influenza-like illness. the three maternal characteristics regressions test whether mothers select into conception months (Eq. 1) and the extent to which additional controls (Eq. 2) and mother indicators (Eq. 3) control for this selection. the birth outcome regressions estimate the conception month effects given these different sets of controls."}
