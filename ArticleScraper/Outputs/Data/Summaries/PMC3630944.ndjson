{"summary": "manson was born in 1844 at oldmeldrum, a small market town near Aberdeen, Scotland. his mother, Elizabeth Livingstone, was a distant relative of the great explorer and Christian missionary of Africa. he was noted for his interest in carpentry, cricket and hunting with shotguns. manson started studying medicine at the university of Aberdeen for 4 years. he spent another year in reading and visiting hospitals, schools and museums. he performed 17 postmortem dissections on patients with psychiatric illnesses. manson died the next day following his treatment by a traditional Chinese doctor. he became humbler and wiser with each of his failures. he befriended the local Chinese and learned the local languages including the aborigines. in the 1877 cholera outbreak in amoy, 95% of the population was affected. in 1877, 95% of the population was affected and 2% died. his younger brother also died in amoy in 1878. manson designed the manson's trocar and cannula for the single-handed blind exploration and treatment of deep seated liver abscess. the trocar and cannula produced at a local ironsmith in Amoy can be fitted to a stylet and perforated drainage tube. western doctors dispensed poisons called Shan-si-fan (\u00e7\"\u00e7, literally, \u2018the powder of life and death') to people who fell ill and could only be cured by Western doctors who had the antidotes. manson became a clinician-scientist and popularized smallpox vaccination at Amoy which markedly reduced the incidence and mortality from smallpox. manson found a microscopic nematode worm in the chylous urine and blood of an Indian patient suffering from chyluria. this struck him as he had operated on many cases of elephantiasis who also had chyluria. he returned to Amoy with his wife and a compound microscope in 1876. microfilaria of Wuchereria bancrofti with sheath in the peripheral blood of human (Giemsa stain; original magnification, 200). manson built a small mosquito house covered with fine mosquito-proof gauze. he put microfilariae-infected patients to sleep inside the mosquito house. manson and Ross discovered malaria transmission by mosquitoes in 1898. he communicated this finding to manson and encouraged him to take up this important piece of research in India. he wrote to manson, 'what a beautiful discovery this is. I venture to praise it because it belongs to you, not to me' manson proposed that this lung fluke have an intermediate host in fresh water crustaceans for the completion of its life cycle. he proposed that this fluke should have an intermediate host in fresh water crustaceans such as snails for the completion of its life cycle. his fresh water snail theory was later applied successfully to schistosomiasis. erunner of the university of Hong Kong (HKU) emphasized the role of the college in medical education to fight ignorance, superstition and outdated traditions of the feudal Ching Dynasty. he also highlighted the importance of a correct attitude in the process of education on science and medicine, that 'high personal character, a reputation for wisdom, humility, honesty and kindness' new clinical entities such as tropical (fatty) liver could be easily treated by heavy exercise and dietary discretion. there was no portal of sharing on such important knowledge between doctors till the founding of this medical society. despite his heavy engagement in medical education, he did not withdraw from his medical practice. the direction of infectious disease research has switched to emerging infectious diseases since the 1990s. human immunodeficiency virus, influenza A H5N1 virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus emerged in 1997 and 2003. iry Farm at the Pokfulam district in 1886 provided a hygienic and affordable supply of milk and dairy products for pregnant women, children and patients. poor nutrition is the underlying cause of most infectious diseases. cause-of-death prediction model has named poor nutrition as the underlying cause of most infectious diseases. global programmes in vector control remain the mainstay in the control and eradication of malaria, filariasis and dracunculiasis. global programmes in vector control remain the mainstay in the control and eradication of malaria, filariasis and dracunculiasis. the geographical range of arthropod-borne infections has expanded in recent years in both latitude and altitude. many newly described emerging infections also require a vector, for example the new phleboviruses41,42 and Ehrlichia."}
