{"summary": "mucosal antibodies can readily neutralize invading viruses at the luminal site of the epithelial layer and prevent their entry into host cells. such an immune exclusion effect is mainly mediated by secretory IgA (SIgA), which is effectively induced by mucosal but not parenteral immunization. intracellular viruses can be neutralized during transcytosis of dimeric SIgA through the epithelial layer. a study in horses using an ISCOM-adjuvanted influenza vaccine showed that intranasal boosting after intramuscular priming does not have much effect on serum IgG levels. but results in low and transient SIgA and IgG responses in nose washes. no comparison was performed with alternative immunization strategies. a 10 mg/ml stock solution was prepared in HBS buffer (5 mM Hepes, 150 mM NaCl and 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) as described previously. a stock of A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) influenza virus (PR8) propagated on Madin-Darby canine kidney cells was provided by Solvay Biologicals (Weesp, Netherlands) Vaccines were mixed at the indicated amounts of subunit and GPI-0100 just before immunization. female Balb/c mice aged 8\u201310 weeks were grouped (n = 6 per group) and immunized IM, IN or IPL with 1 g PR8 subunit vaccine with or without 15 g GPI-0100 in a two-dose immunization regimen with a 20 day interval. mucosal wash samples were collected in 1 ml phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing protease inhibitor. mice were sacrificed on day 27 and sacrificed on day 37. nose wash, lung wash, blood and spleen samples were collected for immunization. serum IgG response was calculated as the10 log of the reciprocal of the sample dilution corresponding to an OD 492 of 0.2. sera with titers below the detection limit were assigned an arbitrary titer corresponding to half of the detection limit. differences in influenza-specific responses between groups of mice were significant. p value of p 0.05 was considered significant. a p value of p 0.05 was considered significant. hemagglutinin (HA) content was assumed to be equal to the total protein for subunit material based on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) results. Vaccines were mixed at the indicated amounts of subunit and GPI-0100 just before immunization. for IM immunizations, vaccines in 50 l were divided over both hind legs. g PR8 subunit IM IM 2N 1 g PR8 subunit + 15 g GPI-0100 IN IN N+M 1 g PR8 subunit + 15 g GPI-0100 IPL P+M 1 g PR8 subunit + 15 g GPI-0100 IPL IM Pre-boost blood samples were collected on day 27. nose wash, lung wash, blood and spleen samples were collected for ex vivo immuno-assays. IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a ELISA H1N1-specific antibody responses were determined by ELISA as previously described [28] for nasal SIgA and IgG responses, the average OD 492 for each group at each dilution was calculated. serum IgG response was calculated as the10 log of the reciprocal of the sample dilution corresponding to an OD 492 of 0.2. titers of individual mice are given and the results are presented as10 log virus titer per gram of lung tissue. unpaired Student\u2019s t-test was used to determine if differences in influenza-specific responses observed between groups were significant. IPL approach (2P) resulted in significantly higher lung SIgA titers than the IPL/IM approach (P+M; p=0.0109). IM/IM immunized reference group did not develop detectable lung SIgA titers. ELISA on nose wash samples revealed that IN-primed mice did not develop detectable nasal SIgA responses even after a booster via the mucosal or systemic route and challenge with live virus. Marginal SIgA amounts were found in nose washes from IM/IM-immunized animals. mice primed with the IN vaccine and boosted IM developed significantly higher levels of lung IgG and nose IgG. both IN, and IPL priming resulted in detectable IgG responses by day 21. however, the titers were significantly lower for IN-primed mice. mice were collected three days after the challenge upon sacrifice for the evaluation of hemagglutination-inhibition-inhibition (HAI) titers. none of the mice receiving the adjuvanted influenza vaccine by IN/IN immunization developed detectable serum HAI titers. IgG1 responses were low in all mice immunized twice IM, IN, or IPL. systemic boost resulted in significantly enhanced serum IgG2a responses. spleens of the immunized mice were collected one week after booster. specific IFN- responses in mucosally-primed mice were significantly enhanced by IM boost as compared to mucosal boost. in IN-primed mice, IM boost was significantly more effective than IN boost in enhancing the number of IL-4-producing T cells. a similar effect was not observed in IPL-primed mice. one mouse developed a titer of 2.5910 log/g lung tissue. the adjuvanted vaccine provided complete protection of the lungs from virus growth irrespective of the immunization strategy followed. lung SIgA was readily detectable in mice primed via the IPL route. but the IPL/IPL approach (2P) resulted in significantly higher lung SIgA titers than the IPL/IM approach (P+M; p=0.0109). IN-primed mice did not develop detectable nasal SIgA responses even after a booster via the mucosal or systemic route. in contrast, IPL-primed mice developed robust nasal SIgA responses, but only when the booster was given also via the IPL route. IN route was ineffective in priming and boosting mucosal responses. both IN, and IPL priming resulted in detectable IgG responses by day 21. but the titers were significantly lower for IN-primed mice. 2log HAI titers and the geometric mean per group are given. only 5 samples from the 2P treatment group were available for the HAI assay. IgG2a responses were low in all mice immunized twice IM, IN, or IPL. in contrast, systemic boost had a negative effect if any on IgG2a titers in IPL-primed mice. H1N1-specific IFN- responses were barely detectable in mice receiving plain influenza vaccine IM or those receiving GPI-0100-adjuvanted influenza vaccine IN or IPL. influenza-specific IFN- responses in mucosally-primed mice were significantly enhanced by IM boost as compared to mucosal boost. mmunized control mice developed an average lung virus titer of 3.5910 log/g lung tissue. the lung virus titer was under the detection limit in 5 out of the 6 mice of the IM-immunized control group. one mouse developed a titer of 2.5910 log/g lung tissue. IPL/IM approach resulted in relatively modest mucosal antibody responses. but it was equally effective as IPL/IPL strategy for induction of systemic antibodies. the coefficient for nose IgG vs. serum IgG and lung IgG vs. serum IgG are 0.59 (p=0.0013) and 0.72 (p0.0001) respectively. the results are generally in line with an earlier study by Minne and coworkers who tested to which extent the delivery site in the respiratory tract impacts on the immune response elicited by influenza vaccines. IM and IPL boosting were equally effective in eliciting serum IgG and HAI titers. strong systemic antibody responses can be achieved by either two IPL immunizations or IPL priming followed by IM boosting. GPI-0100-adjuvanted influenza vaccine elicited marginal IgG2a and IFN- responses using IPL/IPL approach. IM boosting decreased the IgG2a response, but significantly enhanced the IFN- response of IPL-primed mice. memory B cells primed by the mucosal, but not the systemic, route preferentially express SIgA. this is the major antibody subtype which mediates early immune exclusion and also exhibits cross-protective capacity."}
