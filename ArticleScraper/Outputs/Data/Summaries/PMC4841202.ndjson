{"summary": "the Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arthropod-borne flavivirus of the family Flaviviridae. it usually causes a mild dengue-like illness with possibly fever, joint pains, rash, and/or swollen lymph nodes 9. it was neglected because there are multitudes of viruses and ZIKV had not seemed to cause severe pathology. the first baby in the u.s. born with ZIKV occurred on January 16 th, 2016 12. the relationship between ZIKV infection during pregnancy and microcephaly is strongly suspected 14. it has also resulted in the world health organisation moving much faster than they did against EBOV 15. there are no specific molecules identified as active against ZIKV. there are several patents on compounds for dengue 19. NIH NIAID has responded by suggesting they would consider submissions for grants that address this virus 21. if we want a molecule to reach the clinic quickly for ZIKV, probably the most expedient method may be to repurpose FDA and/or EU approved drugs 23. this has led to new in vitro or in vivo active compounds of clinical relevance in a number of cases 24, 25. ideally these need to be released to the world for examination. 86 FDA approved drugs active in vitro or in vivo vs dengue virus. a first step would be to develop a whole cell or target-based ZIKV in vitro assay. this would be amenable to medium to high throughput screening. effective antiviral compounds would prevent cell death and could be detected by the reduction of resazurin to resofurin by the change in color (from purple to pink) effective antiviral compounds could be detected by the reduction of resazurin to resofurin by the change in color (from purple to pink) the main reason preventing us from this approach could be potential low throughput of the developed assay. however, this could be overcome by in-kind donation of drug samples from big pharmaceutical companies or chemical manufacturers. a third approach would be to explore the complete genome of ZIKV 35, 36 or the recently published genome for ZIKV circulating in the Americas 37. a fourth approach would be to develop homology models for ZIKV proteins that are similar to those targeted by molecules that are active against the dengue virus 39\u2013 45. a final step would be to test compounds in an animal model of ZIKV. it is unclear whether larger animal models have been developed and tested yet. despite the significant advances in the biological sciences over the last 70 years, many of our current anti-infectives arose during the world war II drug discovery effort. a pharmacophore could describe the inhibition of EBOV by amodiaquine. the other patients generally were treated with another malaria medication, artesunate-lumefantrine, which had not been found to have potential activity against Ebola. complementary parallel efforts should be undertaken in order to understand the virus structure, function, and especially its burden on the human health. the scientific community needs further information to clarify the dangers created by ZIKV: is ZIKV the only or the main reason for the rise in microcephaly cases and Guillain-Barre syndrome\" the value of these vouchers and those for pediatric rare diseases 68 is continuing to increase. the neglected disease space has many issues, including shortage of funds. the recent ZIKV outbreak reasserts the importance of preparedness for new viruses. we have herein proposed several approaches that could be actionable now with a bare minimum of resources and funding. it may be the case that we already have FDA and EU approved drugs that while showing activity against other viruses may have a role to play in further testing for efficacy against Zika. we may want to consider combination therapies like those used in HIV 70. fgk gslvtcakfa cskkmtgksi 421 qpenleyrim lsvhgsqhsg mivndtghet denrakveit pnspraeatl ggfgslgldc 481 eprtgldfsd lyyltmnnkh wlvhkewfhd iplpwhagad pyronaridine had the highest LibDockScore score of 142. the well known antiviral Ribavirin has a docking score of 101. predictions suggest that Quinacrine may be targeting this protein. other antimalarials may also be worth testing. the following sequence of the Zika virus envelope protein (E) was taken from the polyprotein 109. the part corresponding to E is from residues 291\u2013592. the IG-like domain III is from residues 601\u2013693. ftkipae tlhgtvtvev qyagtvtvtvev qyagtvtvtvgrlit anpviteste 661 nskmmleldp pfgdsyivig vgekkithhw hrsgsti Swiss-Model 110 was used to construct a homology model using the Dengue crystal structure 4gsx as a template (58.69 identity) 111 ritonavir, indinavir and saquinavir docked in the Prestwick Chemical Library. the top 10 docked molecules from the Prestwick Chemical Library. the top 10 docked molecules from the Prestwick Chemical Library."}
