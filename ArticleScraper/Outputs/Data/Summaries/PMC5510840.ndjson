{"summary": "nasopharyngeal microbial pathogens and commensals during viral upper respiratory tract infection (URI) and acute otitis media (AOM) in infants. the 16S rRNA V4 gene regions were sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform. acute otitis media (AOM) occurs as a complication of viral upper respiratory tract infection (URI) it is the leading cause of doctors\u2019 visits by children. it is the most frequent reason children consume antibiotics or undergo surgery. nasopharyngeal microbiota in infants followed from near birth to the first AOM episode or 12 months of age. nasopharyngeal bacterial colonization lead to susceptibility to URI and AOM development. DNA was extracted using the PowerMag PowerMicrobiome DNA/RNA Isolation kit (MoBio) in the STARlet platform (Hamilton Robotics) the conserved hypervariable 16S rDNA V4 region was amplified by PCR. raw BCL files were retrieved from the MiSeq platform and called into FASTQs by Casava v1.8.3 (Illumina) s were removed from the results if their absolute crossover cost was 3 using a k-mer size of 6 using a k-mer size of 6. the Shannon diversity index was calculated using the entropy function in the entropy library in R statistical package (cran.r-project.org) DNA was extracted using the PowerMag PowerMicrobiome DNA/RNA Isolation kit (MoBio) in the STARlet platform (Hamilton Robotics) the conserved hypervariable 16S rDNA V4 region was amplified by PCR. the amplicons were sequenced using 2 x 250 bp paired end protocol on the MiSeq platform (Illumina) d to the database were placed into de novo OTUs (97% similarity) and aligned against the reference database with 80% similarity threshold. the Shannon diversity index was calculated using the entropy function in the entropy library in R statistical package (cran.r-project.org) Asian 2 (1) 0 2 (3) Ethnicity - Hispanic/ Latino 77 (56) 35 (54) 42 (57) - NonHispanic/ Latino 62 (44) 30 (46) 32 (43) Breastfeeding - Exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months 13 (9)b 5 (8) 8 (11) - Exclusive formula feeding 62 (45) 32 (49) 30 (41) - Mixed feeding 57 (41) 23 (35) 34 (46) One or more siblings at home (% yes) 55 57 54 of 971 sequenced samples, 948 (98%) yielded 1000 sequences. overall, 4 phyla predominated the sequence reads. there was no association between with age or sample type. diversity was highest at 7d after antibiotic use (P = 0.011) diversity was not associated with gender (P = 0.22), race (P = 0.88), breastfeeding (P>0.4), or mode of delivery. samples from Phylum Class Order Family Genus all subjects without and with AOM subjects with AOM P-value (Age-adjusted) (N = 948) (N = 516) (N = 432) Actinobacteria Actinobacteria Corynebacteriales Corynebacteriaceae Corynebacterium 17.8% 19.7% 15.5% 0.0071* Proteobacteria Gammaproteobacteria Pseu e Bifidobacterium 2.9% 2.1% 3.9% 0.0316 Proteobacteria Gammaproteobacteria Enterobacteriales Enterobacteriaceae Enterobacter 2.5% 1.9% 3.1% 0.0019* Actinobacteria Actinobacteria Micrococcales Micrococcaceae Micrococcus 1.6% 1.6% 1.7% 0.5602 Proteobacteria Gammaproteobacteria Chromatiales Ectothior a-66 subjects had AOM in the first year; 73 subjects did not.
