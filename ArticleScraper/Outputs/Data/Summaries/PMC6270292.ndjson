{"summary": "the prevalence of allergic diseases such as allergic rhinitis, asthma and atopic dermatitis (AD) has increased dramatically in developed and developing countries. the world health organization estimated that 300 million people in the world population of 7.1 billion (about 4%) have allergic asthma. AD is one of the most frequent chronic inflammatory skin diseases, affecting 25% of children and 1\u20133% of adults worldwide. PHF contains five herbs: Lonicerae Flos (Jinyinhua), Menthae Herba (Bohe), Moutan Cortex (Danpi/DP), Atractylodis Rhizoma (Cangzhu) and Phellodendri Cortex (Huangbai) in a ratio of 2:1:2:2:2:2:2:2:2:2. different herbs in PHF possessed anti- the aim of the present study was to elucidate the mechanisms of the in vitro anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic activities of PHF, Danpi and GA via their modulation of: (i) expression of cell surface adhesion molecules. the release of chemokines and cytokines from allergy-related alarmin IL-33-activated human basophils can be recruited to the inflammatory tissues in allergic disorders including allergic asthma. DP and GA could significantly suppress expression of ICAM-1 on KU812 cells in a dose-dependent manner. reduced ICAM-1 expression on IL-33 activated KU812 cells suggests that PHF, DP and GA may inhibit endothelial transmigration of basophiles to inflamed sites. the release of CCL2, CCL5 and CXCL8 from IL-33-activated KU812 cells was significantly suppressed by the treatment with PHF, DP and GA. the suppressed release of these inflammation-related chemokines from IL-33-activated KU812 cells may reduce the infiltration of immune cells such as Th cells, eosinophils and basophils to the inflamed sites. release of chemokines in culture supernatants was determined by CBA. p 0.05, ** p 0.005, *** p 0.001. effects of IL-6 with soluble IL-6 receptor- can lead to the transition of acute to chronic inflammation. p38 MAPK, NF-B and JNK play crucial roles in regulating cell apoptosis, cell proliferation and inflammatory cytokines release. both p38 MAPK, NF-B and JNK play crucial roles in regulating cell apoptosis, cell proliferation and inflammatory cytokines release. the reduction of the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, IB and JNK by GA could be the underlying intracellular mechanisms accounting for the suppression of ICAM-1 expression and release of CCL2, CCL5, CXCL8 and IL-6. the mean of the phosphorylation of p38MAPK of GA (100 M) is still lower than that of GA (10 M) dexamethasone is a potent synthetic member of the glucocorticoid class of steroid drugs. it has been reported that dexamethasone can promote eosinophilic apoptosis. of 5,000 KU812 cells are expressed as the mean plus SEM of MFI. release of CCL5 and IL-6 in culture supernatants was determined by CBA. higher concentrations of dexamethasone (0.1 and 1 g/mL) together with GA (10 g/mL) did not exhibit any significant suppression of ICAM-1, CCL5 and IL-6 compared with GA or dexamethasone alone. reduced ICAM-1 expression on IL-33 activated KU812 cells suggests that PHF, DP and GA may inhibit the endothelial transmigration of basophiles to the inflamed sites. surface expressions of ICAM-1 on 5,000 KU812 cells are expressed as the mean plus SEM of MFI. the release of CCL2, CCL5 and CXCL8 from IL-33-activated KU812 cells was significantly suppressed by the treatment with PHF, DP and GA. the suppressed release of these inflammation-related chemokines may reduce the infiltration of immune cells such as Th cells, eosinophils and basophils to the inflamed sites. inflammatory cytokine IL-6 is produced by T cells and macrophages at the inflammatory site. it plays an important role in the regulation of immune responses, immediate and late-phase allergic inflammation, and Th17 cell activation. the combined effects of IL-6 with soluble IL-6 receptor- can lead to the transition of acute to chronic inflammation by means of switching transmigration from neutrophils to monocytes/macrophages into the inflamed site. p38 MAPK, NF-B and JNK are involved in the intracellular signaling pathways contributing to the inflammatory responses in granulocytes such as basophils and eosinophils. both p38 MAPK and JNK play crucial roles in regulating cell apoptosis, cell proliferation and inflammatory cytokines release. GA (100 M) did not show any significant further suppression on the IL-33-induced phosphorylation of p38MAPK. however, the mean of the phosphorylation of p38MAPK of GA (100 M) is still lower than that of GA (10 M) dexamethasone can promote eosinophilic apoptosis and inhibit basophilic migration. a low concentration of dexamethasone (0.01 g/mL) with GA (10 g/mL) could further suppress ICAM-1, CCL5 and IL-6 expression. dexamethasone 0.01 g/mL, DMSO: dimethyl sulfoxide 0.2% (vol/vol), GA10: GA 10 g/mL, GA100: GA 100 g/mL. however, higher concentrations of dexamethasone (0.1 and 1 g/mL) together with GA (10 g/mL) did not exhibit any significant suppression of ICAM-1, CCL5 and IL-6 compared with GA or dexa Purified mouse IgG1 isotype control, mouse anti-human IBa (pS32/pS36), mouse anti-JNK (pT183/pY185), mouse anti-p38MAPK (pT180/pY182) were purchased from BD Pharmingen Corp., (San Diego, CA, USA) the supernatants were filtered through 0.22 m polyethersulphone filter. if there was any herbal debris, it was dried at 57 \u00b0C overnight. the concentration of the solution = (weighted mass before dissolving in PBS mass of herbal debris) KU812 cells were seeded in 24-well plate at a density of 5 105 cells in 500 L RPMI-1640 complete medium per well. cells were then pre-activated with IL-33 (50 ng) for 1 h followed by treatment with various concentrations of PHF, DP or GA in the presence of IL-33 for further 18 h. okines, cytokines, supernatants, supernatants and supernatants were subjected to analysis. the beads contained monoclonal antibodies against individual cytokine and chemokine. the samples were then washed, resuspended and subjected to analysis. sion molecule, intracellular phosphorylated signaling molecules and chemokines and cytokines were analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur) as mean fluorescence intensity (MFI), which includes both the changes of target molecule expression in individual cells and the percentage of cells expressing the target molecules. the three batches of water extracts were mixed together and centrifuged to remove the herbal debris. the combined extract was vacuum dried to form herbal powder which was stored in desiccators until use. the dosages of DP used were 100\u20131,000 g/mL. analyses were performed using the HPLC system. the system was monitored by a computer equipped with the 32 Karat Software. KU812 cells were seeded in 24-well plate at a density of 5 105 cells. they were then pre-activated with IL-33 (50 ng) for 1 h. cells were then used for the detection of expression of adhesion molecules. 5 105 cells seeded in 24-well culture plate were pre-activated with IL-33 (50 ng) for 30 min or 1 h followed by 15-min treatment with GA. cells were then washed, resuspended and subjected to analysis. expressions of surface adhesion molecule, intracellular phosphorylated signaling molecules and chemokines and cytokines were analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur) as mean fluor all analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences statistical software for Windows, version 16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) findings suggest that TCM Pentaherb Formula and its herbal component Danpi and bioactive compound gallic acid can suppress inflammation elicited by IL-33-activated allergic inflammation-related effector cells."}
