{"summary": "canine adenovirus (CAV) can be grouped into two distinct but related serotypes. canine adenovirus type 1 (CAV-1), the virus which causes infectious canine hepatitis, and canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2) have been found in dogs. ELISA was found to be a highly efficient and rapid test to determine the immune status of dogs to infectious canine hepatitis virus and canine adenovirus type 2 [15], 16. the ELISA is a sensitive, reliable and fast method for the detection of anti-adenovirus antibody. seven of the animals that were sampled in the study were below 1 year of age, 53 were aged 1-2 years, 58 were aged 1-2 years, 64 were 3 years of age, 4 were 4 years of age, and 2 were 5.5\u20136 years of age. complete blood counts were performed for all dogs, and the presence of haematological disorders was recorded for each animal. serums were inactivated in 30 min at 56\u00b0C before being used. leukocyte samples were prepared from blood samples taken into tubes with EDTA. the samples were retrieved from the deep freezer in which they were stored. all wells were added 75 L of the ready-to-use CAV conjugate procured from VMRD (USA) the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humid incubator for 30 minutes. a droplet of 90% glycerol solution was added to each well. seven of the animals were below 1 year of age, 53 were aged 1-2 years, 58 were 2 years of age, 64 were 3 years of age, 4 were 4 years of age, and 2 were 5.5\u20136 years of age. total blood counts were performed for all dogs. blood samples were drawn into normal tubes for serum and into EDTA tubes. serums were inactivated in 30 min at 56\u00b0C before being used. leukocyte samples were retrieved from the deep freezer in which they were stored. the slides were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humid incubator for 30 minutes. after a 24-hour period allowed for adsorption, the cell surfaces were rinsed with phosphate buffer solution (PBS) each well was added 200 L of virus growth medium. the cells were fixed in acetone for 10 minutes. of the 108 female animals sampled in the study, 55 (50.9%) were determined to be positive for CAV antibodies, while 48 (60%) of the sampled 80 male animals were confirmed to be positive. of the 53 animals aged 1-2 years, 22 (41.2%); of the 58 animals aged 2 years, 31 (53.4%); of the 64 animals aged 3 years, 31 (53.4%); and of the 6 animals aged >4 years, 5 (83.33%) were found to be positive. blood samples from dogs were processed and inoculated onto confluent monolayers of MDCK cells using standard virological techniques. the inoculated cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C and observed daily for the appearance of cytopathic effect (CPE) no morphological changes were observed in cell cultures. the adenovirus replicates in the lymph tissue and then spreads into the bloodstream. the replication reaches peak levels in 3\u20136 days after infection. the reason for unavailability of virus isolation may be due to the time of sampling. in the present study, antibody prevalence was found to be higher in animals aged 2 years and above. out of the 60 animals below 2 years of age, 23 (38%) and out of the 128 animals aged 2 years and above, 80 (62.5%) were confirmed to be positive for CAV antibodies. of the 111 dogs, 37 were owned animals tended to by their owners. no reliable information was able to be accessed for the vaccination status of the remaining animals. this clinical picture is known to be caused by CAV-1. however, as early detection was not possible, the CAV antibodies were not able to be typed in the animals that presented with leukopenia and lymphopenia. a comparative assessment was not able to be made in this study. the antibody prevalence detected in the unvaccinated animals was considered an indicator of the presence of CAV infection in dogs. it is considered that regular vaccination would provide protection against the disease for a certain period in dogs."}
