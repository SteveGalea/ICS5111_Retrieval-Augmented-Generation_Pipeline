{"summary": "an estimated 2.5 billion people reside in DENV-endemic or DENV-epidemic regions. more than 100 million DENV infections occur each year, ranking it among the most medically significant arthropod-borne diseases. more complete temporal clinical and immunologic data sets from individual DENV-infected NHPs would be useful for understanding how each DENV serotype affects overall host homeostasis. viremia and neutralizing antibody immediately after challenge have been used as correlates of protection, but host immunity over longer periods of time remains largely unknown. clinical responses to DENV infection in vivo may identify useful clinical measures relevant to evaluating efficacy of potential DENV vaccine and therapeutic candidates. rhesus macaques were infected with human DENV isolates of each serotype. Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV; vaccine strain SA14-14-2) was obtained during participation in the study reported by Ferguson and others23 and amplified once in C6/36 cells before use in the animals. in vitro studies, virus stocks were amplified by inoculating vero cell monolayers with 200-400 L of DENV or JEV stock. titer was determined by standard virus titration assay using Vero cell lines. cells were grown to 80% confluence in 24-well plates. cells were grown to 80% confluence in 24-well plates. twenty juvenile seronegative animals with weights of 4\u20136 kg were selected for the study. all animals were sedated for DENV inoculations and phlebotomy. all animals were sedated for deNV inoculations and phlebotomy. assay plates were washed four times and 100 L of colorimetric substrate 2,2\u2032-azino-di-[3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonate (6)] diammonium salt was added to each well. after 10\u201315 minutes of color development, optical density was measured (405 nm wavelength) groups of animals (n = 4) were given 105 plaque-forming units (PFU) of DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 serum fraction was isolated from sodium citrate\u2013treated whole blood by centrifugation (900 g for 15 minutes) separate 140-L aliquots of EDTA-treated whole blood sample were diluted in either 600 L AVL (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) for RNA extraction or 600 L of sterile PBS (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for virus isolation. samples for RNA isolation were homogenized by using a mini-bead beater transferase (GGT), glucose (GLU), globulin (GLOB), total protein (tPRO), cholesterol (CHOL), urea, calcium (Ca), carbon dioxide (tCO2), chloride (Cl), sodium (Na), potassium (K), and phosphorus (Phos) were defined by comparison with prebleed values and previous described reference hematologic ranges for rhesus macaques. RNA was extracted from infectious virus, eluted in a volume of 60 L. all reactions contained 2 L of purified RNA diluted in 23 L of RT-PCR master mixture. 2 L represented genomic material from 105, 103 or 101 PFU. the limit of detection for each RT-PCR, based on RNA extracted from infectious virus, was the equivalent of 100.01 PFU. the limit of detection for each RT-PCR was the equivalent of 100.01 PFU. biotinylated cytokine detection antibodies (Invitrogen) and streptavidin\u2013phycoerythrin (Invitrogen) were used at manufacturer's recommended dilution. assays were performed on a Luminex\u00ae 200 ISTM machine equipped with bio-Rad. plates were washed twice in PBS and fixed in 80% methanol for 20 minutes. fixed plates were stored at 20\u00b0C until staining. each well was blocked in a 5% milk/PBS solution for 10 minutes. 96-well microtiter plates were coated overnight with 100 L of rabbit polyclonal anti-human IgM or IgG (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) diluted 1:1,000 in 0.045 M sodium bicarbonate/0.018 M sodium carbonate solution. coat solution was removed and the wells were blocked with 200 L 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA; American Bioanalytical, Inc., Natick, MA)/PBS for 2 hours assay plates were washed as before, and 100 L of HRP-conjugated rabbit polyclonal anti-mouse antibodies (Dako) diluted 1:1,000 in 0.1% BSA/PBS was added to each well. OD was measured (405 nm wavelength) by using the Versamax microplate reader (Molecular Devices Corp.) DENV-1 and DENV-4 isolates had been amplified twice on vero cells. deNV-2 was amplified once on vero cells, five times on vero cells. all four stocks have been shown to lead to productive infection in NHPs. titer was determined by standard virus titration assay using Vero cell lines. cells were grown to 80% confluence in 24-well plates. cells were grown to 80% confluence in 24-well plates. twenty juvenile seronegative animals with weights of 4\u20136 kg were selected for the study. all animals were sedated for DENV inoculations and phlebotomy. all animals were sedated for DENV inoculations and phlebotomy. assay plates were washed four times and 100 L of colorimetric substrate 2,2\u2032-azino-di-[3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonate (6)] diammonium salt was added to each well. after 10\u201315 minutes of color development, optical density was measured (405 nm wavelength) groups of animals (n = 4) were given 105 plaque-forming units (PFU) of DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 serum fraction was isolated from sodium citrate\u2013treated whole blood by centrifugation (900 g for 15 minutes) separate 140-L aliquots of EDTA-treated whole blood sample were diluted in either 600 L AVL (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) for RNA extraction or 600 L of sterile PBS (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for virus isolation. ine kinase (CK), -glutamyltransferase (GGT), glucose (GLU), globulin (GLOB), total protein (tPRO), cholesterol (CHOL), urea, calcium (Ca), carbon dioxide (tCO2), chloride (Cl), sodium (Na), potassium (K), and phosphorus (Phos) were defined by comparison with prebleed values. RNA was extracted from infectious virus, eluted in a volume of 60 L. all reactions contained 2 L of purified RNA diluted in 23 L of RT-PCR master mixture. 2 L represented genomic material from 105, 103 or 101 PFU. each assay was performed by using optical 96-well microtiter assay plates. iliter using linear regression based on Ct values for purified DENV or JEV RNA standards. the limit of detection for each RT-PCR was the equivalent of 100.01 PFU. biotinylated cytokine detection antibodies (Invitrogen) and streptavidin\u2013phycoerythrin (Invitrogen) were used at manufacturer's recommended dilution. assays were performed on a Luminex\u00ae 200 ISTM machine. plates were washed twice in PBS and fixed in 80% methanol for 20 minutes. fixed plates were stored at 20\u00b0C until staining. each well was blocked in a 5% milk/PBS solution for 10 minutes. 96-well microtiter plates were coated overnight with 100 L of rabbit polyclonal anti-human IgM or IgG (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) diluted 1:1,000 in 0.45 M sodium bicarbonate/0.018 M sodium carbonate solution. coat solution was removed and the wells were blocked with 200 L 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA; American Bioanalytical, Inc., Natick, MA)/PBS for 2 hours. assay plates were washed as before, and 100 L of HRP-conjugated rabbit polyclonal anti-mouse antibodies (Dako) diluted 1:1,000 in 0.1% BSA/PBS was added to each well, and plates were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. antigen captured by test serum samples was detected by using the Versamax microplate reader (Molecular Devices Corp.) sixteen rhesus macaques were divided into four groups. each group was inoculated subcutaneously with 105 plaque-forming units of DENV-1 (strain Western Pacific), DENV-2 (strain NGC), DENV-3 (strain Sleman/78), or DENV-4 (strain 814669) RNA was column extracted immediately after collection and used in RT-PCR. for each blood sample, the Ct value was converted to a relative quantity of DENV genomic RNA by using linear regression based on Ct values. peak detection of DENV genomic RNA was on day 5 pi and persisted in most animals until day 8. the mean and SEM are shown on the y-axis for positive samples that only included DENV-2-infected and DENV-3-infected animals. despite serotype differences in viremia, similar IgM responses were detected in all animals after infection. 14 and 30 were diluted 1:50 and assayed in triplicate by using IgM capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reagents from Venture Technologies. Optical density (O.D.) was determined by measuring the absorbance at 405 nm. day post-infection is shown on the x-axis. whole blood collected on days 0 (prebleed), 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, and 14 post-infection were submitted to a veterinary diagnostic service laboratory for analysis. cytokines assayed included IL-2, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, INF-, MCP-1, and TNF-. moderate increases in IL-2, IL-12, INF-, and TNF- concentrations were evident in some animals. the deNV-3-infected animals had less IL-2 by comparison, and undetectable TNF-. however, IFN- levels appeared to be higher and more sustained in all animals. decreased MCH and MCHC consistent with hypochromic anemia were observed in two DENV-2-infected animals starting 10 days pi. hypochromic anemia, often resulting from iron deficiency, suggests more pronounced disruptions in blood homeostasis. AST, CK, UREA, CHOL, and GLU among most inoculated animals suggest the common occurrence of liver damage during DENV infection. increased serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatine kinase (CK), urea (UREA), cholesterol (CHOL) and glucose (GLU) decreased blood bicarbonate concentration correlate with mild blood acidosis. uncontrolled activation of blood coagulation pathways during dengue hemorrhagic fever can result in disseminated intravascular coagulation and hemorrhage. plasma was collected on days 0 (prebleed), 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 and 14 post-infection. each sample was loaded on an automated STA Stago compact analyzer. the deNV-1 and DENV-4 homotypic antibodies appear to persist at higher levels than deNV-2 and deNV-3 homotypic antibodies. pan-reactive heterotypic antibodies persisted through day 390. levels were significantly lower than heterotypic antibody levels present in the first three months after infection. at 120 days pi, homotypic neutralizing antibody titers exceeded 1:100 for all animals and, in some, were greater than 1:7,000 (Table 2). animals infected with DENV-1 or DENV-2 exhibited weak cross-neutralizing activity against DENV serotypes -1, 2, and -3. rhesus macaques were inoculated subcutaneously with 105 PFU of DENV-1 (strain Western Pacific), DENV-2 (strain NGC), DENV-3 (sleman/78), DENV-4 (strain 814669), or JEV (strain SA 14-14-2). animal health, blood biochemistry, complete blood counts, viral loads, cytokine levels, and blood coagulation were also quantified after infection. a previous study reported clinical symptoms in rhesus macaques. overt symptoms, including rash or visible signs of hemorrhage, did not develop in inoculated rhesus macaques. however, animal behavior remained consistent during the weeks after challenge. viremia may have been undetectable because of possible differences in the route of infection compared with those in previous DENV vaccine studies15. Alternatively, the DENV genomic RNA may have peaked and resolved before day 5 or levels of RNA were below the sensitivity of the RT-PCR. serum IgM responses exhibited high cross-reactivity with heterotypic DENV serotypes. these results suggest a productive infection in all animals after DENV inoculation and activation of the host adaptive immune response. WBC absolute counts remained low in two deNV-2-infected and three deNV-4-infected animals, except two deNV-3-infected animals, #9 and #11, respectively. monocyte numbers fluctuated over the course of infection and varied greatly between animals and serotype. uninfected control animals had detectable IL-12; however, concentrations did not change over time. increased serum levels of IL-2, INF-, IL-8, MCP-1, and TNF- were observed 5\u201314 days after DENV infection. cytokines were nearly undetectable in all other animals in this group. serum samples were analyzed by using nonhuman primate multiplexed microsphere protein-based cytokine assays. analysis included interleukin (IL)-2, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, interferon (INF)-, monocyte chemotactic protein-1(MCP-1), and tumor necrosis factor. blood samples collected on days 0 (prebleed), 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, and 14 post-infection were submitted to a veterinary diagnostic service laboratory for analysis. show temporal changes in red blood cell count (RBC), hematocrit (HCt), hemoglobin (Hb), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) serum samples were collected on days 0 (prebleed), 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, and 14 post-infection. temporal changes in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatine kinase (CK), urea (UREA), cholesterol (CHOL) and glucose (GLU) increased PT, aPTT, or TT were not evident. plasma fibrinogen, which is cleaved to produce fibrin, was decreased in several infected animals 5\u201310 days pi. abnormal plasma concentration of FIB and Pro C was seen only in animal #10. serologic assays were performed to survey homotypic and heterotypic IgG responses for 390 days after DENV infection. deNV-specific serum IgG remained increased for months and decreased to equilibrium levels by 90 days pi. animal numbers for each DENV serotype are indicated in the panel of graphs on the left. animal numbers for each DENV serotype are indicated in the panel of graphs on the left and remain same across rows. fected with deNV-2 continued to decrease over the course of the study. non-neutralizing, pan-reactive, and serotype-specific neutralizing antibodies persist for over a year in DENV-infected animals. cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies also persisted in half of the DENV-1-, DENV-2-, and DENV-4 infected animals. increased serum cytokines IL-2, TNF-, and chemokines IL-8 and MCP-1 indicated an inflammatory response during DENV infection and suggest systemic activation of macrophages. potential differences could contribute to inflammation and disease pathogenesis during primary and subsequent DENV infections. ation of coagulation and disruption of blood biochemical parameters may have systemic effects on organ health in the heart and kidneys. all viruses studied were capable of producing irregularities in hematologic results/coagulation and were able to stimulate cellular responses. the exact molecular mechanisms mediating perturbations of blood homeostasis remain unknown because of lack of proper animal models for DENV. serum samples collected during this study have been deposited in BEI Resources Repository. comparing outcomes of primary and secondary heterotypic DENV infection will be useful for further elucidating host response mechanisms that might be involved in pathogenesis."}
