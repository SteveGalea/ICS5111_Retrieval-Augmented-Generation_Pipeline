{"summary": "children of less than 12 years of age were attended by paediatricians. the clinical diagnosis was coded using the international classification of disease, 10th Revision. patients with any associated codes for sinusitis, otitis media, bacterial pharyngitis, pneumonia or who had underlying chronic heart or lung disease were also excluded. a sample of nasopharyngeal wash was obtained from each patient at the enrollment visit. median time from the onset of symptoms to the collection of nasal washings was three days (1-5 days) samples were collected and processed using previously published procedures. significance level for all tests was 5%. chi-square test or the Fisher's exact test was used to compare averages between two groups of data in cases of independent samples. influenza B 6 (4.5) Adenovirus 6 (4.5) Enterovirus 2 (1.5) Metapneumovirus 1 (0.7) Total of monoinfection cases 69 (51.5) Rhinovirus and influenza A 6 (4.5) Rhinovirus and adenovirus 4 (3) Rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus 3 (2.2) Adenovirus and influenza A 3 (2.2) Rhinovirus and influenza B 2 (1.5) Influenza B and coronavirus 2 ( the clinical justifications for prescription of antibiotics were: in 37.7% (20/53) to treat nasal or postnasal discharge during the first week of common cold symptoms in patients without fever, in 18.9% (10/53) to treat persistence of cough during the first week of symptoms, in 11.3% (6/53) to treat common cold and in 1.9% (1/53) to treat wheezing symptom. day 1 was the first day of common cold symptoms. 45.3% (34/75) were prescribed antibiotics. 32.2% (19/59) of those who did not have fever at the onset of symptoms received antibiotics. symptoms and received antibiotics, 31.6% (6/19) were prescribed antibiotics judiciously. the average time to the resolution of symptoms of children with no signs of bacterial infection was 16.7 days. the average time to the resolution of symptoms was 8.9 days for the group that received antibiotics and 7.0 days for the group that did not. management of AOM encourage the initial observation of nonsevere cases in selected children (i.e., \u201cwatchful waiting\u201d) there are still controversies around the diagnosis and management of AOM. in routine practice, the over diagnosis of AOM is frequent but there are difficulties in confirming the diagnosis. in our study we considered all indications of antibiotic for AOM as adequate regardless of the patients' age, severity of symptoms and certainty of diagnosis. a self-limited course of seven-10 days with no reduction of the duration of symptoms with the use of antibiotic. the study was not designed to evaluate the influence of fever in medical decision to prescribe antibiotics. there was no difference in the proportion of antibiotic prescriptions for patients who had fever at the onset of symptoms and for those who did not. in brazil, diagnostic tests for respiratory virus are still expensive and not easily available for the vast majority of the population. this study was conducted at one primary care facility."}
