{"summary": "primary human renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (RPTEC) were obtained from a commercial supplier for studies of Simian virus 40 (SV40) within twelve hrs after cell cultures were initiated, cytoplasmic vacuoles appeared in many of the RPTEC. this batch of RPTEC was rejected for the SV40 study. the adventitious viruses that are encountered in cell cultures often stem from bovine serum that is used to supplement cell growth media. this includes: bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) [1-6], bovine polyomavirus [1,7,8], bovine parvovirus [1,9-11], bovine herpes virus [1,12-15]. SV40 is a polyomavirus that was once referred to as \u201cvacuolating agent\u201d or \u201cSimian vacuolating virus 40\u201d because commonly studied SV40 strains induce the formation of cytoplasmic vacuoles late during infection of most permissive primate cells [22]. a batch of primary human RPTEC that had been obtained for our previous transcription study of well-known vacuolating strains of SV40 proved unsuitable. a single cause of the RPTEC deterioration was unlikely, as we detected 3 different human viruses in the RPTEC: human cytomegalovirus (CMV), human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), and human herpesvirus 6B (HHV-6B). a majority of humans are seropositive for CMV [24,25]. HCoV-NL63 is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus of the genus Alphacoronavirus (family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales) first identified in 2003 from a child with bronchiolitis in the Netherlands, it is now recognized that HCoV-NL63 can cause upper and lower respiratory tract infections in humans. cells were thawed and seeded in cell culture flasks after cryopreserved RPTEC were thawed and seeded. we observed that about 60% of the attached cells were vacuolated. the RPTEC basal growth medium had been supplied with the cells. no CPE were detected in A549, NIH/3 T3 and BHK-21 cells for 1 month post-exposure to RPTEC-derived material. cell death 48 hpi Subcultures, freeze-thaw 7d post-seed of RPTEC CPE 6 dpib CPE 7 dpid CPE 5 dpie CPE 6 dpie CPE 6 dpie NA. the pH at 37\u00b0C of fresh BGM was approximately 7.36 (within normal range), and ammonia was not detected using a salicylate-based method. these findings suggested neither incorrect pH nor presence of ammonia in BGM were causing vacuolation of the RPTEC. the RPTEC were releasing either a biomolecule(s) or virus(es) that adversely affected some of the cell lines. morphological aberrations were most notable in WI-38 cells. CV-1, HEK-293, Mv1 Lu, and Vero cells were most pronounced in LLC-MK2 cells and in HEK293 cells. thereafter, CPE were most pronounced in LLC-MK2 cells and in HEK293 cells. cytolysis of syncytia appeared larger at 34\u00b0 than 37\u00b0C. day old RPTEC cultures were difficult to interpret. at low magnification, vacuoles and cell deterioration were obvious. occasional viral particles consistent in appearance and size with CMV at different stages of maturation were observed at higher magnifications. d RPTEC lysate from 7-day old cultures instead of spent media from 5-day old RPTEC cultures. however, CPE were not observed in LLC-MK2 cells at early times onto 30 days p.i. as before, vacuolation was more pronounced at 37\u00b0 than 34\u00b0C. Lane 2, HCoV-NL63-specific PCR product (237 bp) amplified by PCR primers repSZ-1 and SZ-3. Lane 3, Non-infected LLC-MK2 control tested using PCR primers repSZ-1 and SZ-3. electron microscopy of HCoV-NL63 in LLC-MK2 cells was obtained. Immature HCoV-NL63 particles in rough endoplasmic reticulum cisternae. double membrane vacuoles are evident, adjoining a granular nucleocapsid material in a packet (GNCM), in association with the larger packet of virus particles. phylogram depicts the relationship of NL63 coronavirus isolate RPTEC/2004/1 to representative NL63 isolates. bayesian tree based on full length genomic sequences (27,490 characters including gaps) for 21 NL63 coronavirus isolates. PCR tests for herpesviruses that were not included in previous assays were performed on DNA extracted from RPTEC. identity was confirmed by sequencing. biotypes of plaque-purified HCoV-NL63/RPTEC/2004 compared to HCoV-NL63/Amsterdam-1. plaque-purified HCoV-NL63/RPTEC/2004 stocks in LLC-MK2 cells formed the same type of CPE as the plaque-purified HCoV-NL63/RPTEC/2004 isolates. the cells of Table 1 were infected at a MOI of 0.1 PFU/cell. a few examples are depicted in Figure 8A-C. HCoV-NL63/RPTEC/2004 pp isolate A showed the highest titer (3.2 105 PFU/mL) when the virus was propagated in LLC-MK2 cells. similar results were obtained for the 2 viruses; the results for RPTEC/2004 pp D are shown in Figure 9B. a few floating dead cells, large areas of clearing, and a small syncytium are visible (400X). titers were obtained from free virus in spent media; plaque assays were performed in CaCo-2 cells. titers were obtained from free virus in spent media; plaque assays were performed in CaCo-2 cells. the RPTEC were not vacuolated when sub-confluent (Figure 10A) yet became vacuolated once confluent (Figure 10B) but otherwise stayed viable when re-fed every 2 days with REBM. extensive CPE consisting of rounding of the cells and cytolysis occurred by 3 dpi in RPTEC (Figure 10C-E) and 4 dpi in HRE cells (Figure 11B-C). a new batch of primary RPTEC infected with HCoV-NL63/RPTEC/2004 pp A and HCoV-NL63/RPTEC/2004 pp A and HCoV-NL63/Amsterdam-1. a subconfluent RPTEC, 400x. [B] Non-infected confluent RPTEC, 400x. [D] Confluent RPTEC infected with HCoV-NL63/RPTEC sterdam-1 formed relatively high viral titers by 4 dpi in RPTEC and HRE cells, but not in HRCE cells. the viral titers exceeded those formed in LLC-MK2 cells by about 2 orders of magnitudes. in contrast, viral titers for both virus strains remained low (103 PFU/ml) in HRCE cells by 9 dpi. a clear halo were present in enlarged nuclei in some of the RPTEC. the same cells were enlarged relative to a majority of the others. the findings were considered pathognomonic for cytomegalovirus (CMV) d CPE consisting of rounding of the cells and detachment or cytolysis, at 34\u00b0 and 37\u00b0C. d CPE consisting of rounding of the cells and detachment or cytolysis, at 34\u00b0 and 37\u00b0C. no CPE were detected in A549, NIH/3 T3 and BHK-21 cells. WI-38 cells 12 hrs post-exposure to spent BGM from a 24 hr RPTEC culture, 400X. CV-1, LLC-MK2 and Vero cells, which are cell lines derived from monkey kidneys, did not get vacuolated after 24 hrs incubation with BGM. thus, no evidence of cytotoxicity due to BGM was uncovered. immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and PCR for CMV Some RPTEC from 48 hr cultures were positive for CMV by IFA. the extracted DNA was PCR negative for human herpes virus (HHV)-1 and HHV-2, and polyomaviruses SV40 and BKV (Table 1). morphological aberrations were most notable in WI-38 cells. cytolysis of syncytia in LLC-MK2 cells appeared more pronounced at 37\u00b0 than 34\u00b0C. rounding followed by eventual detachment from the growing surface occurred in infected HEK-293 cells. in MDCK cells, vacuoles were also more pronounced at 37\u00b0 than 34\u00b0C. a majority of the virus-like particles were spherical, and they collectively ranged from about 80 to 120 nm in diameter. a majority of the virus-like particles were morphologically different from CMV; some seemed to have surface projections. RT-PCR and sequencing showed one of the viruses in the CV-1, HEK-293, LLC-MK2, MDCK, MDCK-London, Mv1 Lu, and vero E6 cells was coronavirus HCoV-NL63. we did not test for retroviruses, acknowledging exogenous or endogenous retroviruses may have been causing syncytia in the cells. cells Proof that HCoV-NL63 was replicating in LLC-MK2 cells was obtained by electron microscopy. granular nucleocapsid material is visible in some of the virus particles. a counter-stain was not used to visualize the viral spikes surrounding the viruses. a complete consensus genomic sequence of HCoV-NL63 was obtained for virus in LLC-MK2 cells that had been incubated at 34\u00b0C. the virus, designated HCoV-NL63 strain RPTEC/2004/1, has a genomic length of 27,553 bp. PCR tests for herpesviruses that were not included in our previous assays were performed on DNA extracted from RPTEC. a 151-bp amplicon was generated using nested primers for HHV-6. HCoV-NL63 replicates more effectively in CaCo-2 cells than LLC-MK2 cells [49] at 37\u00b0C [29,49] and in LLC-MK2 cells at 32\u00b0C (32\u00b0 to 34\u00b0C are considered optimal temperatures for the in-vitro cultivation of HCoV-NL63 [33-35,47,50,51]. HCoV-NL63/RPTEC/2004 isolates formed the same type of CPE as the plaque-purified HCoV-NL63/RPTEC/2004 isolates. each plaque-purified virus induced vacuolation, rounding of the cells, and the formation of syncytia. cytopathic effects formed by HCoV-NL63/RPTEC/2004 pp A and by HCoV-NL63 Amsterdam 1. non-infected LLC-MK2 cells, 8 days, 33\u00b0C (400X) average virus titers (PFU/ml, mean of 3 measurements) were: LLC-MK2 cells, 3.2 105; Vero E6 cells, 2.3 104; HEK-293 cells, 5.9 104; CV-1 cells, 1.6 104; MDCK-NBL cells, 4.3 103; MDCK-London cells, 4.1 103; Mv1 Lu cells, 6.9 103; WI-38 cells, none detected. sive CPE consisting of rounding of the cells and cytolysis occurred by 3 dpi in RPTEC and 4 dpi in HRE cells. when 1 ml of spent media was obtained from RPTEC or HRE cells 3 days after they had been infected with HCoV-NL63 RPTEC/2004 pp A or HCoV-NL63/Amsterdam-1. in contrast, 1 ml of spent media from non-infected HCoV-NL63/RPTEC/2004 pp A or HCoV-NL63/RPTEC/2004 pp A or HCoV-NL63/RPTEC/2004 pp A, 3 dpi, 400x. titers for both virus strains remained low in HRCE cells by 9 dpi. reactivation of CMV in renal tubule epithelial cells can complicate kidney transplantation, leading to poor long-term graft function. reactivation of CMV in renal tubule epithelial cells can complicate kidney transplantation, leading to poor long-term graft function. growth of HCoV-NL63 in various cell lines appears consistent with literature reports. growth of HCoV-NL63 in LLC-MK2 and Vero cells is well known. growth of HCoV-NL63 at 37\u00b0C has been reported. the origin of HEK-293 is unclear, as the cells express neurofilament (NF) subunits NF-H, NF-L, NF-M, alpha-internexin, and other proteins found in neurons. it is not clear why rapid cell swelling rounding, and vacuolation followed by cell death occurred in WI-38 cells. HCoV-NL63 has not been reported in natural infections of human kidneys. the ability of HCoV-NL63 to replicate to high titers in primary RPTEC and HRE cells suggests some human kidney cells are fully permissive for the virus. we are unable to resolve whether the cells were contaminated during preparation. HCoV-NL63 replicates to high titers in a human colon carcinoma. the new virus has been fully sequenced, classified as a group C -coronavirus. the same coronavirus was isolated in the summer of 2012 from a patient with acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia [67,68] recombinant epidermal growth factor, hydrocortisone, epinephrine, gentamicin sulfate and amphotericin-B were obtained as a kit from the RPTEC supplier. the RPTEC were first seeded onto four T25 flasks and manipulated following instructions included in the kit. both DMEM and EMEM were supplemented with antibiotics. EMEM formulated with calf serum (HyClone) instead of FBS was used for NIH/3 T3 cells. plasmocin-treated cell lines and RPTEC cells were tested by PCR. fresh glutamine deficiency test was added to BGM in a 24 hr RPTEC culture. cells observed every six hrs for one day to assess effect on cell morphology, vacuolation, and viability. cytotoxicity assay Complete, freshly prepared BGM was substituted for DMEM in subconfluent cultures. resuspended with cold fixative to a final volume of 500 l. fixed cells were post-fixed with osmium tetroxide, stained with uranyl acetate, then thin-sectioned. about 50% of the RPTEC had completely deteriorated. TPCK-trypsin in serum-free media was used to facilitate the isolation of influenza and other viruses that require protease cleavage of some viral component for infectivity. after inoculation, the cells were re-fed every 3 days with 3% serum media or serum-free media with trypsin for long-term observations. total RNA was purified from a freeze-thawed seven-day old RPTEC culture supernatant using a QIAamp Viral RNA kit (QIAGEN) the primers and conditions that were used for PCR-based detection of viruses were based on published literature. PCR efforts were focused on human herpes, paramyxo (measles, mumps, metapneumovirus, parainfluenza viruses 1\u20135, respiratory s N5-PCR1 and N3-PCR1 amplify a 314 bp amplicon from the HCoV-NL63 nucleocapsid region. followed cDNA synthesis primed with repSZ-RT [33], primer pair repSZ-1, and repSZ-3 amplify a 237 bp amplicon from the HCoV-NL63 ORF1b region at a PCR annealing temperature of 46 PCR was performed using Phusion Polymerase (new England Biolabs) with denaturation steps performed at 98\u00b0C. the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends of HCoV-NL63/RPTEC/2004 were determined from vRNA using a RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) kit (RLM RACE, Ambion, Austin, TX) new batch of primary human kidney cells Primary human kidney cells were obtained from Lonza, Inc. (allendale, NJ) the cells chosen were: Renal Cortex Epithelial Cells (HRCE), Human Renal Epithelial Cells (HRE), and Renal Proximal Tubule Epithelial Cells (RPTEC) gentamicin sulfate and amphotericin-B were obtained as a kit from the RPTEC supplier. the RPTEC were first seeded onto four T25 flasks and manipulated following instructions included in the kit. DMEM and EMEM were supplemented with antibiotics. EMEM formulated with calf serum (HyClone) instead of FBS was used for NIH/3 T3 cells. cell lines were propagated in growth media with plasmocin for 2 weeks. plasmocin-treated cell lines and RPTEC cells tested negative for mycoplasma. cells incubated at 37\u00b0C and observed for morphological aberrations over 48 hrs. the cells were replaced with fresh ice-cold cacodylate-buffered 4% gluteraldehyde (pH 7.2) after 2 hrs, the cells were scraped free using a cell scraper. the fixed cells were post-fixed with osmium tetroxide, stained with uranyl acetate, embedded in Spurr\u2019s embedding medium, then thin-sectioned. the thin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and transmission electron microscopy performed using a Hitachi H-600. the cells were re-fed every 3 days with 3% serum media or serum-free media with trypsin for long-term (up to 30 day) observations. the cells were scraped free and transferred along with the spent BGM into a sterile 50 mL centrifuge tube. the frozen tube of scraped RPTEC was freeze-thawed three times. syncytia were formed by the second virus (not CMV) that we were attempting to identify.
