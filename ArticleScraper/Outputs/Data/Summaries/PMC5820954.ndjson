{"summary": "recent outbreaks of novel diseases in humans and domestic animals underscore the critical need to elucidate the factors that enable pathogens to become established in new host species. contact depends on opportunities for the pathogen to leave the original host and gain access to a novel host. exposure of European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) to the myxoma virus during an eradication attempt in Australia in the mid-20th century was sufficient to allow for pathogen emergence. enetic analyses suggest that Wolbachia bacteria independently colonized multiple species of arthropods via horizontal transmission (15, 19, 20) the jump of S. aureus from humans to rabbits required only a single mutation in a gene encoding an integral membrane protein (1). for other bacteria, there is evidence of more restrictive host ranges despite regular contact with other potential host species. zootic resulted from a single host shift event of M. gallisepticum from poultry. the subsequent spread of M. gallisepticum throughout north american house finches was uniquely well documented thanks to externally visible symptoms of conjunctivitis and quick identification of M. gallisepticum as the causative agent. HF1995-infected birds were significantly more likely to test positive for infection. at 2 days postinfection, HF1995-infected birds were significantly more likely to test positive for infection. only 6 of the 15 (40%) birds inoculated with HF1995 tested positive for M. gallisepticum. boxplot diagram shows peak bacterial loads in infected house finches following inoculation with either a poultry strain of M. gallisepticum (Rlow) or a house finch epizootic-outbreak isolate (HF1995) boxplots show the median and range peak loads, with significantly lower peaks in birds inoculated with HF1995. in birds inoculated with HF1995, there was a significant quadratic relationship between the production of M. gallisepticum-specific antibodies and time. the strength and pattern of this relationship differed significantly between the two treatment groups, leading to a significant treatment-by-time interaction. a virulent strain of poultry M. gallisepticum, Rlow (31), should be able to infect house finches upon inoculation. compared to the 1995 house finch epizootic outbreak strain, HF1995, Rlow achieved substantially lower bacterial loads. however, house finches were able to clear Rlow much faster than HF1995. divergence in genes coding for proteins involved in cytoadhesion is of particular interest. the attenuated poultry strain of M. gallisepticum, Rhigh, exhibits low levels of host cell adherence and minimal pathology in poultry relative to Rlow (38). this is thought to result in the loss of expression of gapA and cmrA, which encode proteins involved in cytadherence. etic analysis of 107 M. gallisepticum strains from poultry, house finches, and other songbirds revealed that all isolates obtained from non-house finch songbirds clustered with house finch rather than poultry isolates (46). however, house finch M. gallisepticum causes conjunctivitis only to closely related species within the family Fringillidae. sporadic sampling of M. gallisepticum strains from house finches is conducted randomly. the unique outbreak of severe conjunctivitis in house finches attests to the fact that these spillovers are generally unsuccessful. the genetic changes required for host shifts are themselves extremely rare. males in one treatment group (n = 15) were inoculated with an epizootic outbreak house finch M. gallisepticum strain cultured from a wild-caught house finch in 1995. to prevent M. gallisepticum transmission between treatments, we housed finches in separate rooms under identical conditions. depth was measured with calipers to 0.1 mm. the scaled picture files were then duplicated. one file was used for the placement of 10 landmarks around the inner ring of the conjunctiva. PCR parameters were as follows: 94\u00b0C for 5 min, 35 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 55\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 30 s. in each assay, M. gallisepticum DNA extracted from pure culture served as a positive control. for all M. gallisepticum-positive samples, we then quantified bacterial loads using the remaining choanal swab extract and a TaqMan qPCR amplification the goat anti-passerine immunoglobulin Y (IgY) secondary antibody (53) was conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) using a Lightning Link HRP kit. plates were incubated for 1 h at RT and then washed three times in 1 wash buffer. 100 l of ELISA stop buffer (0.18 M H2SO4; Bethyl Laboratories), plates were read at 450 nm using a bioTek PowerWave XS plate reader. samples were considered positive for M. gallisepticum-specific antibodies if the absorbance at 450 nm was at least three times the background. symptomatic individuals used only a Mann-Whitney U test to test for differences in circulating levels of anti-M. gallisepticum antibodies over time (i.e., between 7 and 28 dpi) in infected individuals, we used lme4 and performed a generalized linear mixed-model analysis, with antibody concentration as the response term and with time, treatment, and their interaction as explanatory terms. males in one treatment group (n = 15) were inoculated with an epizootic outbreak house finch M. gallisepticum strain cultured from a wild-caught house finch in 1995. males in the second treatment group (n = 15) were inoculated with a poultry M. gallisepticum strain (Rlow [passage 17]) the scaled picture files were then duplicated, with one file used for the placement of 10 landmarks around the inner ring of the conjunctiva. the area of the conjunctiva was then calculated as the area of the outer ring minus the area of the inner ring. the threshold value was subtracted from all measurements. PCR parameters were as follows: 94\u00b0C for 5 min, 35 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 55\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 30 s. in each assay, M. gallisepticum DNA extracted from pure culture served as a positive control. for all M. gallisepticum-positive samples, we then quantified bacterial loads using the remaining choanal swab extract and a TaqMan qPCR amplification the goat anti-passerine immunoglobulin Y secondary antibody (53) was conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) using a Lightning Link HRP kit. plates were incubated for 1 h at RT and then washed three times in 1 wash buffer. samples were considered positive for M. gallisepticum-specific antibodies if the absorbance at 450 nm was at least three times the background. all samples were run at the same dilution, allowing for comparison of concentrations between treatments based on the pooled standard curve but not determination of absolute concentrations. to test for differences in circulating levels of anti-M. gallisepticum antibodies over time (i.e., between 7 and 28 dpi) in infected individuals, we used lme4 and performed a generalized linear mixed-model analysis."}
