{"summary": "XBP-1 plays a major role in regulating unfolded protein response. it is triggered when endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is under stress (1). XBP-1U and XBP-1S share a common N-terminus. XBP-1-knockout B cells display impaired immunoglobulin secretion. ectopic expression of XBP-1S can be restored by ectopic expression. cellular UPR can be induced by infection of various viruses. XBP-1S transactivation domain may interact with a specific cellular co-activator. this is responsible for the up-regulation of XBP-1S target genes. the molecular mechanism of XBP-1S transactivation remains to be determined. the plasmids for expression of human PCAF and p300 were obtained from Open Biosystems. the plasmids containing a series of hemagglutinin tagged XBP-1 deletions were generous gifts from Dr Hiderou Yoshida. the IP kit was purchased from Roche and Co-IP was performed according to the manufacturers\u2019 instructions. the immunoprecipitated complexes were analyzed by western blotting. all the antibodies used in our study were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, except the anti-HA antibody (Sigma) s were amplified using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) the primer pairs used in this study include: BiP (5\u2032-GGTGAAAGACCCCTGACAAA-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GTCAGGCGATTCTGGTCATT-3\u2032), EDEM (5\u2032-AGGTGTGTGTGTGTGG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GGATTCTCTTCTC-3\u2032), and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPD quantitative-PCR was performed to determine the relative amount of DNA that was immunoprecipitated by anti-XBP-1 or anti-PCAF antibodies in the presence of Tm or Tg. the primer pairs used to amplify the promoter regions of BiP and CHOP genes include: BiP (5\u2032-GATGGGGCGGATGTTATCTA-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CTCTCACACTCGCGAAACAC-3\u2032) human XBP-1S and XBP-1U expression plasmids were previously described. the plasmids for expression of human PCAF and p300 were obtained from Open Biosystems. co-immunoprecipitation and western blotting 293T cells were transiently co-transfected with indicated expression plasmids. the cell lysates were prepared 2 days post-transfection for co-IP. to get the high levels of ectopic expression, 293T, a highly transfectable derivative of HEK293, was chosen for the Co-IP study. HEK293 cells were treated with Tm (10 g/ml) or Tg (300 nM) for 16 h prior to cross-linking. DNA fragments at around 200\u20131000 bp were achieved by sonication with Microson Ultrasonic Cell Disruptor (Misonix) XBP-1 or anti-PCAF antibodies were added to the sheared chromatin individually and incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight. the DNA was then pulled down by protein G agarose and the DNA in the complex was purified using QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) PCAF and p300 are required to activate HTLV-1 transcription through three 21-bp repeats known as Tax-responsive element (TRE) located with the HTLV-1 promoter (30) each TRE contains a binding site for CREB/ATF proteins. the association between PCAF and another member of CREB/ATF protein family, CREB1, was also examined. the immunoprecipitated complexes and protein inputs were analyzed by western blotting. the presence of XBP-1S in the immunoprecipitates was determined by western blotting. cell lysates were used for IP with an anti-PCAF antibody. PCAF binds to XBP-1S through the transcriptional activation domain of XBP-1S located in its C-terminal region. 293T cells were transfected with the indicated plasmid to express an individual XBP-1 deletion. HEK293 cells were transiently co-transfected with a luciferase reporter. the amounts of PCAF and p300 plasmids were titrated at 3-fold increment. the total amounts of plasmids were kept constant by adjusting the mock vector. the impact of PCAF knockdown on the activation of HTLV-1 and BiP transcription by XBP-1S was studied next. HEK293 cells were transiently co-transfected with a luciferase reporter. the siRNAs included non-specific (i.e. Con.), luciferase (i.e. GL3), two PCAF (i.e. PCAF-6 and PCAF-7) and two p300 (i.e. p300-7 and p300-10) siRNAs. results obtained from the PCAF overexpression and knockdown reporter assays. XBP-1S regulates the transcription of BiP by binding to the ERSE element located within the BiP promoter. no activating effects on the ERSE mutant BiP promoter were detected. HEK293 cells were co-transfected an indicated BiP-Luc reporter, a XBP-1S expression plasmid, and a PCAF expression plasmid (at 3-fold increment). compared to the DNA transfection, co-transfection of DNA plasmids and siRNAs was much more cytotoxic. expression of PCAF and XBP-1S was analyzed by western blotting. cells were transfected with an empty vector and a non-specific shRNA. mRNAs of the target genes, including BiP, CHOP and EDEM, were quantified by QRT\u2013PCR. XBP-1S recruits PCAF to the target genes of XBP-1S in vivo. mCF7 cells were co-transfected with a PCAF expression vector and an indicated plasmid. incubation of Tm resulted in 15- and 5-fold increases in XBP-1S binding to BiP and CHOP promoters. only 3- and 1.7-fold increases in PCAF associating with the two genes. QRT\u2013PCR and quantitative ChIP analyses suggest limited involvement of PCAF in mediation of XBP-1S target genes during UPR. induction of UPR has no effect on the association between XBP-1S and PCAF. no changes in the binding of PCAF to XBP-1S were detected under the treatment of Tm. PCAF was found in the immunoprecipitated complexes of XBP-1S expressing cells, but not in XBP-1U or CREB1 expressing cells. no association between p300, XBP-1S, XBP-1U and CREB1 was detected. cells were co-transfected with a p300 expression vector and an indicated plasmid (i.e. XBP-1S, XBP-1U, and CREB1 plasmids, respectively). cells were transfected with an individual XBP-1 truncation plasmid followed by IP using anti-PCAF antibodies. hek293 cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter. hek293 cells were transfected with the indicated plasmid to express an individual XBP-1 deletion. PCAF is required for XBP-1S-mediated activation of HTLV-1 and cellular gene BiP. p300 plasmids were titrated at 3-fold increment. the total amounts of plasmids were kept constant by adjusting the mock vector. the impact of PCAF knockdown on the activation of HTLV-1 and BiP transcription by XBP-1S was studied. siRNAs included non-specific (i.e. Con.), luciferase (i.e. GL3), two PCAF (i.e. PCAF-6 and PCAF-7) and two p300 (i.e. p300-7 and p300-10) siRNAs. cells were co-transfected with a control non-specific siRNA and a XBP-1S expression plasmid. the wild-type and ERSE-mutant BiP-Luc reporter plasmids were used in the experiments. no activating effects were detected when both PCAF and XBP-1S were overexpressed. however, no activating effects on the ERSE mutant BiP promoter were detected. PCAF mediates the transcription of endogenous XBP-1S target genes. we performed QRT\u2013PCR assays to determine the impact of PCAF on the activation of XBP-1S target genes. co-transfection of DNA plasmids and siRNAs was much more cytotoxic. effectiveness of the PCAF shRNA was confirmed by western blotting. XBP-1S target genes, including BiP, CHOP and EDEM, were quantified by QRT\u2013PCR. cells were transfected with an empty vector and a non-specific shRNA. XBP-1S recruits PCAF to target genes of XBP-1S in vivo. expression vector and an indicated plasmid were carried out. ChIP was carried out followed by quantitative PCR to quantify binding of XBP-1S and PCAF to promoters of BiP and CHOP. QRT\u2013PCR and quantitative ChIP analyses suggest limited involvement of PCAF in the mediation of XBP-1S target genes during UPR. MCF7 cells were co-transfected with a non-specific (i.e. control) or PCAF shRNA. both Tm and Tg were dissolved in DMSO and the final concentration of DMSO in the culture was kept at 0.1%. PCAF-XBP-1S interaction by treating cells with Tm followed by IP analyses. no changes in the binding of PCAF to XBP-1S were detected under the treatment of Tm. tax activates HTLV-1 transcription through three 21-bp repeats known as TRE. each 21-bp repeat contains a CREB/ATF binding site and is known to associate with CREB/ATF family proteins. XBP-1S also stimulated basal transcription of HTLV-1. quantitative ChIP assays showed that XBP-1S recruited PCAF to promoters of endogenous XBP-1S target genes in vivo. but knockdown of PCAF by siRNA or shRNA did not completely inhibit the elevated transcription caused by XBP-1S. elimination of PCAF by RNA interference could only partially inhibit the transactivation of XBP-1S. p300 is recruited to the endogenous BiP promoter in the Tg-treated cells by ChIP assays (41) co-overexpression of p300, YY1 and ATF6 showed synergistic activation of luciferase expression driven by the BiP promoter. p300 might be required for YY1-/ATF6-mediated activation of BiP (41) a recent study identified the regulatory subunit of PI3K as a novel XBP-1S binding protein and demonstrated that the association between XBP-1S and PCAF could be UPR-dependent. the interaction between XBP-1S and PCAF was not disrupted during UPR. PCAF may be an essential factor for other XBP-1S-mediated signaling pathways. XBP-1S is one of the key components in the transcriptional program controlling plasma cell differentiation."}
