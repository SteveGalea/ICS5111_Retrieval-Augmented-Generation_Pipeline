{"summary": "homozygous dt/dt mice were produced from clinically unaffected heterozygous dt/+ mating pairs. animals were killed between 13 and 18 days of age using carbon dioxide. perfusion fixations were authorized by Az 33.9.42502-04/095/07. the dystonin gene was selected for further analysis. a silico analysis of all annotated genes and expressed sequence tags in this region was performed. a PCR mix contained 50 ng genomic DNA. cDNA was transcribed from equal amounts of RNA with the superscript kit from Stratagene (Valencia, CA) cDNA was transcribed from equal amounts of RNA with the superscript kit from Stratagene. lysis was assisted by SilentCrushers at 26,000 rpm for 20 sec at 4\u00b0. Western blot SDS/PAGE was performed with 10 l per lane on gradient gels. gels were equilibrated in electrophoresis buffer with 20% methanol. Membranes were washed three times in TB before being incubated with secondary antibody. the entire lane of the Coomassie blue-stained gel was cut into 23 slices. all slices were reduced with 10 mM DTT for 55 min at 56\u00b0. triedptic peptides were injected into a C18 precolumn. the five most intense ions were sequentially isolated for collision-induced dissociation MS/MS fragmentation and detection in the linear ion trap. the results were transferred to scaffold 3 for further analysis. mice were anesthetized with avertin (tribromoethanol) for transmission electron microscopy. mice were perfused with 2.5% glutaraldehyde. animals were killed between 13 and 18 days of age using carbon dioxide. the pathohistological investigation was done in accordance with the german animal welfare law. proven-positive carrier C57BL/6N mice were mated with FVB/N mice. genome from 12 affected and 20 unaffected F2 offspring was analyzed. DNA extraction involved isopropanol precipitation followed by ethanol washing. the dried pellet was resuspended in 100 l H2O. sequences and PCR conditions can be found in File S1. animals and six dystonin +/+ littermates were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. cDNA was transcribed from equal amounts of RNA with the superscript kit. lysis was assisted by SilentCrushers (Heidolph Instruments, Schwabach, Germany) gels were equilibrated in electrophoresis buffer (0.2 mM glycine, 24.7 mM Tris base, 3.5 mM SDS) gels were equilibrated in electrophoresis buffer with 20% methanol. Membranes were washed three times in TB before being incubated with secondary antibody. bound peptides were eluted and separated on a C18 capillary column (15 cm, 360 m o.d., 75 m i.d., Reprosil-Pur 120, 5 m, C18-AQ; Dr. Maisch) at a flow rate of 300 nl/min, with a gradient from 7.5 to 37.5% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid for 50 min. dystonin +/+ mice, 9 heterozygous dt/+ mice, and 2 C57BL/6N animals were investigated histologically. no differences were observed between dystonin +/+ and dt/+ animals. dt-MP mice showed a severe neuromuscular disorder beginning with a wrist flexion of the forelimbs (arrows) the hindlimbs are splayed (arrows) identification of the genomic region First, we identified a putative genomic region by linkage analysis. the phenotype had previously been restored in offspring from intercrosses of healthy carrier animals to wild-type FVB/N mating partners. it was predicted from the C57BL/6N-FVB/N hybrid genomes that a 28-Mb region on the long arm of mouse chromosome 1 might be affected. introns have been scaled down by a factor of 12.9 for clarity. introns represent start and stop codons, respectively, of the indicated isoforms. the scheme on the bottom represents the genomic region of the dt-MP allele. in total, 39,553 bp are missing entirely, resulting in a 359,762-bp allele in the genome of dt-MP mutant animals. the intragenic deletion was precisely defined and we named the new allele dt-MP. all affected animals had the 1200-bp band spanning over the genomic deletion, indicating the dt/dt genotype. dystonin-a, -b, and -e/n were analyzed in cDNA of brain stem, heart, and skin. in dt/dt mice, no transcript of either dystonin isoform could be detected. western blot with polyclonal antibody 18024 on brain stem tissue. two high molecular weight bands of >200 kDa are detectable in tissue of a control (dt/+) animal, but missing in tissue of a dt/dt littermate. nal anti-dystonin antibody LS-C123425/70642 on brain tissue, peripheral nerve, haired skin, and skeletal muscle of dystonin control mice (+/+) and dt-MP (dt/dt) animals showed neurodegenerative changes predominantly in the brain stem and spinal cord, and rarely in the cerebellum. changes were most prominent in ventrolateral and ventral funiculi. in ventral rootlets swollen axons and dilated myelin sheaths were detected. neuronal changes were seen mostly bilaterally and symmetrically. myelinophages occurred in dilated myelin sheaths. they showed typical argyrophilia in dt-MP (dt/dt) animals. bar, 100 m.

(G) Skeletal muscle of a dt-MP mouse with positively stained muscle fibers. neuronal changes were seen mostly bilaterally and symmetrically. in ventral rootlets swollen axons and dilated myelin sheaths were occasionally detected. elinophages occurred in dilated myelin sheaths (Figure 8, A and B) also showed typical argyrophilia in dt-MP (dt/dt) animals. bar, 100 m. (A) Degenerated neurons with chromatolysis (black arrows) bar, 50 m. immunohistological staining of -amyloid precursor protein (-APP) in a spheroid in a dt-MP (dt/dt) mouse. the majority of spheroids stained positively for -amyloid precursor protein (-APP), phosphorylated neurofilament (p-NF) and nonphosphorylated neurofilament (n-NF) axonal spheroids were characterized by an enlarged diameter, accumulated neurofilaments, numerous mitochondria as well as electron-dense bodies and tubule-vesicular profiles. at the periphery a thin layer of myelin material was present. several axons in the white matter showed a hyper- or dysmyelination with a thickened myelin sheath. twelve of the 20 dt-MP (60%) animals showed mild to moderate suppurative inflammatory changes in the lungs. only one (5%) of the 21 control animals showed a mild suppurative pneumonia. a new mutant allele of the mouse dystonin gene, dt-MP, was characterized by a deletion of 40 kb. western blotting, MS, and immunohistology showed a lack of the dystonin protein expression in homozygous dt-MP mice. affected mice exhibited severe neurological signs and weight loss. skeletal musculature was affected on the ultrastructural level in another mouse mutant suffering from dystonia musculorum. desmoplakin, plectin, and MACF1 all share significant functional homologies to dystonin. anti-dystonin antibody revealed a positive reaction in brain, skin, skeletal muscles, and peripheral nerves of dystonin wild-type (+/+) mice. the antigen expression was severely downregulated in dt-MP mice (littermates of the +/+ mice) clinical signs of affected mice are most likely caused by axonal damage. chromatolysis of neurons may have caused additional secondary axonal damage. axonal damage is regarded as the major pathological correlate of permanent functional deficits. APP accumulation occurs due to turbulences or disruption of the fast axonal transport. this indicates functional changes of damaged axons in dt-MP mice. findings support arguments for a role of dystonin in axonal trafficking. it remains unclear whether the difference in the life span of dystonia musculorum mice is due to their genetic background. dt-MP mice showed widespread neurodegenerative lesions in the brain stem, including nuclei important for the oral and pharyngeal phase of the swallowing process. there were no obvious morphological changes in the investigated lymphoid organs. the molecular origins range from single base pair deletion, point mutation, to translocation. clinical signs like truncal ataxia, reduced muscle tonus, and in one case early death, resemble the dystonia musculorum phenotype. this study presents the identification of a new spontaneous mutation of the dystonin gene in C57BL/6N mice, emphasizing a disturbance of the axonal transport and of the processing of neurofilaments."}
