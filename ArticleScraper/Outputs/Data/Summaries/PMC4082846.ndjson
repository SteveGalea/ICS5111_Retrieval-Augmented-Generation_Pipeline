{"summary": "small ruminants are valuable assets because of their significant contribution to meat, milk, and wool production. in india, sheep and goats play a vital role in the economy of poor, deprived, backward classes, and landless labours. respiratory diseases of small ruminants pose a major obstacle to the intensive rearing of sheep and goats. diseases like PPR, bluetongue, and ovine pulmonary adenomatosis (Jagsiekte) adversely affect international trade. enzootic nasal tumors and ovine pulmonary adenomatosis are common phenomena. these conditions involve respiratory tract as primary target and lesions remain confined to either upper or lower respiratory tract [7, 16], thus, these diseases can be grouped as follows. early, rapid, and effective diagnosis of respiratory diseases in small ruminants is a challenge due to limited laboratory resources in africa and Southeast Asian countries. advanced, rapid, sensitive, and specific serological and molecular tests have been developed. rapid and specific detection of antibodies to the respiratory pathogens is now possible by the advancement in serological testing. molecular biology have led to the development of a variety of diagnostic assays, namely, PCR, RT-PCR, PCR-ELISA, RAPD, AFLP, RFLP, real-time PCR, quantitative PCR, multiplex PCR, LAMP, microsatellites, gene sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis. advances in diagnostic tools and assays help strengthening the surveillance and monitoring systems of animal diseases. copurulent nasal and ocular discharges, necrotising and erosive stomatitis, enteritis, and pneumonia Congestion of mucosa of respiratory tract, exudates in tract, hardening of lungs mainly in anterior lobes, congestion hemorrhages, and erosion in intestinal mucosa HA, HI, ELISA, PCR-ELISA, RT-PCR, real-time PCR LAMP. retrovirus of subfamily Lentiviridae Sheep Chronic emaciation, weakness, dyspnea, lymphoproliferative pneumonia, meningeal arteritis with encephalitis, nonsuppurative arthritis. cELISA, AGID, IP, and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) dullness, depression, mucopurulent nasal discharge, oculonasal blood, and tinged discharge Serofibrinous fluid in lungs with fibrinous adhesions leading to consolidation of lungs Counterimmunoelectrophoresis, ELISA, PCR, multiplex PCR, IHC, ISH, AFLP, AP-PCR, DNA fingerprinting, and Southern blot. peste des petits ruminants (PPR) is an acute and highly contagious viral disease of small ruminants and in particular of goats. the disease is characterized by pyrexia, ocular and nasal discharges, erosive stomatitis, and diarrhea [38, 40]. tination inhibition (HI) can be used quantitatively for the measurement of PPRV antibodies in suspension. competitive ELISA assays can be a better choice for detection of antibodies to PPR. no single assay can detect all the lineages of the virus. the sensitivity of this assay is similar to that of PCR but its simplicity in implementation makes it suitable for practical application. a PCR-ELISA based on N gene has been documented for rapid and specific detection of PPR virus from clinical samples. the assay was found to be 100\u20131000 times superior to s-ELISA. rapid single step real-time RT-PCR has been compared with conventional RT-PCR and Taqman RT-PCR. the assay is more rapid as well as sensitive than TaqMan and the conventional RT-PCR in order to detect nucleic acid of PPRV from the clinical samples of sheep as well as goat. diagnostic technologies have confirmed over the past that the diagnosis of BTV is now widely spread in several parts of india. Traditionally, the diagnosis is primarily based on clinical signs and symptoms. but differential diagnosis with some of the diseases such as contagious ecthyma, foot and mouth disease (FMD), vesicular stomatitis, malignant catarrhal fever (MCF), infectious bovine virus diarrhea (BVD), infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR), parainfluenza is characterized at necropsy by purulent bronchopneumonia (focal) and moderate to severe pulmonary congestion. cross-reactivity of the viruses can be detected by the application of such tests. a molecular tool for detection of parainfluenza virus type 3 (Pi3) from ribonucleic acid samples from cells of the lungs from slaughtered animals. this is followed by sequencing as well as restriction enzyme patterns of the fragment amplified of the F gene which confers confirmation of the distinctness of the isolates. multiplex RT-PCR can help distinguish parainfluenza viruses from other respiratory virus like adenovirus. a two-step TaqMan quantitative (q) PCR is specific as well as sensitive for the detection of infection due to CAEV by the use of a set of primers. a TaqMan probe that targets a region which is highly conserved within the gene that encodes the capsid protein of the virus have been developed. general loss in body condition known as the \u201cthin ewe syndrome\u201d is the first sign of the disease. there may be loss of weight in spite of the normal appetite of the affected sheep. real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) which is specific for the transmembrane region of the envelope gene (tm) has been compared with competitive inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. qPCR may be used as a supplemental tool for diagnosis and measuring the load of the virus. enzootic nasal tumors and ovine pulmonary adenomatosis are closely related to the jaagsiekte retrovirus of sheep. heminested PCR is a potential diagnostic antigen by Western blot and ELISA. the complete genome sequence of the ovine enzootic nasal tumor virus has been done. it has shown its exclusive association with contagious intranasal tumors of sheep. a wide range of media that can be used for isolation of the organism are blood and chocolate agar and casein/sucrose starch agar. for demonstration of the characteristic staining feature, methylene blue or leishman's stain is usually used for serotyping. for rapid identification of capsular type, counterimmunoelectrophoresis is an important diagnostic tool. the pair of primers for this particular assay can amplify a 353 base pair (bp) fragment of the 16srRNA gene. this type of PCR assay usually represents a valuable tool for diagnosing the disease early ultimately facilitating better control of the disease. characterization of isolates can be done by DNA fingerprinting but availability of such diagnostic test is restricted to research laboratories. caseous lymphadenitis is manifested by vague signs such as weight loss, poor productivity, and decrease in fertility. the internal form of caseous lymphadenitis (CLA) is manifested by vague signs such as weight loss, poor productivity, and decrease in fertility. mycoplasmas have complex mechanisms enabling them to evade the immune system. they cause several clinical symptoms which are having significant economic effect on production of small ruminants. mycoplasmas are associated with pneumonic and respiratory conditions in small ruminants. clonal sera was able to differentiate closely related species [111], followed by preparation of different antigens and purification with PAGE and SDS-PAGE. detection of protective and cross-reactive proteins with such purified and specific immunogenic proteins led to development of very sensitive and specific sandwich ELISA based on monoclonal antibodies. a multiplex real-time PCR has been developed for differentiation of the various Mycoplasma species of sheep and goat including Mycoplasma agalactiae. it targets the two specific housekeeping genes, polC and fusA. the assay requires further assessment of clinical specimens but for diagnosis on large scale the assay is very promising. a crude somatic antigen was developed from the first stage larva (L1). the sensitivity as well as the specificity of the assay has been found to be high by the use of a cut-off point. PCR-RFLP has been widely used for identifying taxa of the parasite which are closely related and have forensic relevance [120], 123. agar gel immunodiffusion, virus neutralization, complement fixation, haemagglutination inhibition, and competitive ELISA assays. agar gel immunodiffusion, virus neutralization, complement fixation, haemagglutination inhibition, and competitive ELISA assays. agar gel immunodiffusion, virus neutralization, complement fixation, haemagglutination inhibition, and competitive ELISA assays. tration of the antigen can be done by the use of both haemagglutination (HA) and HI tests. competitive ELISA can be a better choice for detection of PPRV antigen. it has got higher sensitivity than routinely used agar gel immunodiffusion test. the assay was found to be 100\u20131000 times superior to PCR and s-ELISA. a PCR-ELISA based on N gene has been standardized in order to detect PPR virus. the assay has been found to be more sensitive than sandwich ELISA. bluetongue bluetongue is one of the important infectious diseases of domestic and wild ruminants. it is caused by bluetongue virus (BTV) of genus Orbivirus and family Reoviridae. the disease has an incubation period of 5\u201320 days with the development of symptoms within a month. diagnosis with contagious ecthyma, foot and mouth disease (FMD), vesicular stomatitis, malignant catarrhal fever (MCF), infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR), parainfluenza-3 infection, and sheep pox should be done. the confirmatory diagnosis may be done either through virus isolation or through serological test. novel Indian isolates of BTV 21 were detected using real-time PCR assay. parainfluenza parainfluenza is characterized at necropsy by purulent bronchopneumonia (focal) along with moderate to severe pulmonary congestion. cross-reactivity of the viruses can be detected by the application of such tests. RT-PCR can distinguish parainfluenza viruses from other respiratory virus like adenovirus. nucleic acid sequence based amplification (NASBA) has been developed for which primers and probes have been selected from the haemagglutinin-neuraminidase gene and from the phosphoprotein (P) of the parainfluenza virus. two-step TaqMan quantitative (q) PCR is specific as well as sensitive for the detection of infection due to CAEV by the use of a set of primers. a TaqMan probe that targets a region which is highly conserved within the gene that encodes the capsid protein of the virus has been developed. phylogenetic analyses of the proviral DNAs of CAEV across the world have given the suggestion that in certain areas CAEV causes natural infection not only in goats but also real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) which is specific for the transmembrane region of the envelope gene (tm) has been compared with competitive inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA) using sheep sera. both disrupted whole virus and recombinant viral proteins have been used in indirect ELISAs which have shown high sensitivity. the genome of the ovine pulmonary adenomatosis virus is 7,434 nucleotides long. the enzootic nasal tumor virus is closely related to the jaagsiekte retrovirus of sheep as well as to sheep endogenous retroviruses. RT-PCR is very important in order to formulate prevention as well as control strategies. the complete genome sequence of the ovine enzootic nasal tumor virus has been done. it has shown its exclusive association with contagious intranasal tumors of sheep. there may be precipitation of outbreaks due to abrupt environmental changes. a wide range of media that can be used for isolation of the organism are blood and chocolate agar and casein/sucrose/yeast (CSY) agar with supplementation of 5% blood. other media include dextrose starch agar and trypticase soy agar. similar strategies can be adopted for the identification and confirmation of enzootic pneumonia in sheep with advanced molecular methods. characterization of isolates can be done by DNA fingerprinting but availability of such diagnostic test is restricted to research laboratories [85, 93] the internal form of caseous lymphadenitis (CLA) is manifest by vague signs such as weight loss, poor productivity, and decrease in fertility. a double antibody sandwich ELISA has been developed for the detection of the causative agent, Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, in sheep and goats. mycoplasmas have complex mechanisms enabling them to evade the immune system. they cause several clinical symptoms which are having significant economic effect on production of small ruminants. mycoplasmainfection associated syndromes range from septicemia (acute) along with death to chronicity of infection that results in reduced production. detection of protective and cross-reactive proteins with SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting showed some glimpse of diagnostic value. development of monoclonal antibodies based on such purified and specific immunogenic proteins led to development of very sensitive and specific sandwich ELISA based on monoclonal antibodies. for that proteins separated in SDS-PAGE were subject to western blotting with homo- and heterologous sera against Mycoplasma agalactiae and Mycoplasma bovis [9 assay targets polC and fusA considering which specific diagnostic primers and probes are to be developed. it is important to note that the assay requires further assessment of clinical specimens but for diagnosis on large scale basis the assay is very promising. PCR and automated sequencing technologies have been developed for molecular diagnosis of the disease using a cut-off point. a better understanding of several target genes like mitochondrial DNA (mt DNA) and ribosomal DNA (rDNA) is pertinent for understanding evolution of the parasite. cDNA is required to extract the DNA while removing the PCR inhibitors. this helps in achieving greater sensitivity. lamb and kid pneumonia are generally fatal to lambs and kids. advancement in the field of bionomics and biotechnology has led to rapid and accurate diagnosis of many of these economically important diseases. development in field of nanotechnology has led to evolution of nanomedicine with the aid of which it will be certainly possible in near future."}
