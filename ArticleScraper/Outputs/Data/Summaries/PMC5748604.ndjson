{"summary": "lncRNAs are defined as RNAs greater than 200 nucleotides with insignificant coding potential, i.e., noncoding. but they can have very diverse regulatory functions ranging from active transcriptional regulation to epigenetics. most lncRNAs, including those associated with viral infections, lack detailed functional characterization. lncRNAs are generated using the same machinery and components as mRNA (and other ncRNAs), may possess 5\u2032 caps, and may also be polyadenylated at their 3\u2032 ends. lncRNAs permeate the human genome and interdigitate coding regions, but are often dismissed as transcriptional noise. many lncRNAs have been functionally implicated in viral infections. lncRNAs are often involved in the host immune response, but many are also virally-encoded. lncRNAs are often involved in the host immune response. NRON Host Scaffold Latency via inhibition of NFAT nuclear translocation HIV-1 1 of 90 lncRNAs profiled in two human T cell lines [25,26] Tmevpg1 (NeST, IfngAS1) Host Epigenetics IFN-gamma-mediated regulation of adaptive immunity Theiler\u2019s murine encephalo myelitis (TMEV) Candidate gene from Tmevp3 locus [27] and reviews by a comprehensive review by Betancur et al. highlights the pervasive interactions between lncRNAs and complexes such as PRC1, PRC2, MLL1 and BAF. the regulation of expression via chromatin looping and nucleosome positioning is also an established function of lncRNAs. lncRNA methylation functionality and their involvement in developmental processes and disease are highlighted in several reviews. the role of lncRNAs in epigenetic regulation has also been described through the concept of extra-coding RNA (ecRNA) the term was first introduced by Di Ruscio et al. [32] upon the identification of a ncRNA (ecCEBPA) in humans that contained the entire CEBPA pre-mRNA sequence along with \u201cextra\u201d up- and down-stream regions. the role of these lncRNAs in paraspeckle formation has been extensively reviewed [44,45,46,47]. the knockdown of NEAT1 in HIV-1-infected T cells demonstrated that the maintenance of nuclear paraspeckles by NEAT1 is associated with HIV-1 replication. pesvirus saimiri (HVS), Cazalla et al. [54] identified sequence complementarity between HVS-encoded lncRNAs (HSUR1 and HSUR2) and host miRNAs expressed in T cells. miRNA-27 directly downregulates several proteins in the T cell receptor signaling pathway. lncRNAs are often found in complex loci that also contain protein-coding genes. epigenetic regulation and promotion of viral latency LncRNAs have been established as significant players in epigenetic regulation. several studies have characterized associations between lncRNAs and DNMTs: DNMT1 [31,32], DNMT3a [33], and DNMT3b [34]. the biological functionality of lncRNAs from the HOXA and other loci as recruiting factors of major complexes is well-described. a human cytomegalovirus lncRNA interacts with polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) during latency to inhibit host transcription. the HIV-1-encoded antisense lncRNA also interacts with PRC2. both lncRNAs have been implicated in the promotion and maintenance of early latency of their respective viral infections. lncRNAs are known to recruit AGO4 in the canonical RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway. the functional role of lncRNAs has been expanded to include stepwise binding to IDN2 and DRM2 in addition to AGO4. the function of lncRNAs as scaffolds is also described in the formation of oddly-formed nuclear compartments in mammalian cells. lncRNAs have been functionally described as ceRNAs in the progression of gastric cancer [50] and hepatocellular carcinoma [51] there is also evidence that virally-encoded lncRNAs function as miRNA sponges. lncRNAs have been functionally described as ceRNAs in the progression of various cancers. an anti-Alu element in the 3\u2032 end mimics the polypyrimidine tract necessary for the recruitment of splicing factors. an anti-Alu element in the 3\u2032 end mimics the polypyrimidine tract necessary for the recruitment of splicing factors. an anti-Alu element in the 3\u2032 end mimics the polypyrimidine tract necessary for the recruitment of splicing factors, resulting in the targeting of introns containing Alu elements. these screens are capable of directly associating genes with the phenotype of interest while providing support for computationally derived results. a natural choice for discovering specific lncRNAs important for infections is to systematically profile lncRNA changes in response to infection. transcriptome deep sequencing (RNA-seq) is likely the most preferred and widely used. RNA capture sequencing (CaptureSeq, CAP-seq) uses custom-designed, hybridization-based oligonucleotide probes to capture and enrich genes or regions of interest. enriched fraction is subjected to sequencing, resulting in greatly increased target coverage. the annotation of lncRNA genes and its completeness should be examined carefully. for viral infections in well-studied systems like humans or mice, there are large numbers of annotated lncRNAs. lncRNA expression analysis can be carried out simultaneously as all other coding genes. sequencing reads to the species matched reference genome assembly using gapped aligners such as topHat [65] or STAR [66]. Depending on the completeness of the reference genome assembly, unmapped short reads may also be assembled into full-length transcripts or longer transcript fragments using tools like Cuffcompare [67] lncRNA quantification should use transcript alignment-based methods like RSEM [79] or alignment-free methods like salmon [80]. lncRNA quantification should use transcript alignment-based methods like RSEM [79] or RSEM [79]. researchers should carefully consider multiple factors when they plan to use this technology. scRNA-seq has the potential to enable the identification of highly cell type specific lncRNAs that escape identification through current bulk sequencing strategies. the applications of scRNA-seq in large scale perturbation studies will be discussed further in Section 3.4. 3.2. coding transcripts are assumed to share similar functions. this prediction starts with expression data that profiles both coding genes and lncRNAs across multiple conditions. this expression data can be the same RNA-seq data used for identifying infection-related lncRNAs or a complementary RNA-seq data relevant to the infection. gene functions in the same cluster are considered to be co-regulated. a network-based approach can be used to predict the functions of lncRNAs from the known functions within the same network. a popular method called weighted gene co-expression analysis can be used to build gene co-expression networks using the RNA-seq data from virus infected samples. cis-regulatory lncRNAs and coding gene neighbors may have a higher potential for regulatory functions. lncRNAs that occlude the transcription of coding genes through their own transcription typically lack sequence and structural conservation outside of those regions overlapping the promoter region of the coding gene. lncRNAs have very little sequence conservation at the primary sequence level. despite lack of sequence conservation, there still exists many cases of functional conservation. syntenic conservation confers functional significance, as it indicates cross-species selective pressure. slncky identified the vast majority as homologous and increased the size of this orthologous set by roughly 8%. these computational analyses may help investigators decide which lncRNA targets to study further. lack of sequence conservation among most lncRNAs has prompted researchers to look at higher-order structures to infer functional significance. the method predicted CRSs for a staggering 22% of lncRNAs annotated in GENCODE v25, showing a higher density of CRSs at the 5\u2032 end of lncRNAs. this could be a biological phenomenon of lncRNAs; it could also be due to the implementation of the tool. the cRISPR-Cas9 system has emerged as the leading technique for screening host factors important for different viral replications. these screens targeted coding genes based on the loss-of-functions induced by small indels created by the CRISPR-Cas9 system. new modifications are rapidly advancing this approach for screening non-coding RNAs. barcoded gRNAs are PCR amplified and deep sequenced to identify gRNA enrichment and thereby genes associated with susceptibility to the treatment. a small library (six genes targeted by three gRNAs each) was used to target lncRNAs, resulting in an at least 80% knockdown of target genes as determined by qPCR. dCas9-SunTag is fused to a peptide epitope which recruits co-expressed VP64 activation domains. a high-throughput gRNA library screen was able to identify gene activation affecting cell growth in K562 cells. dCas9-VPR was shown to enhance the activation of the non-coding gene MIAT, in addition to other genes. the second round of screening could involve comparing the smaller library against itself or against the larger unbiased library. a pooled screen only provides an association of the perturbation with the phenotype of interest, which may not be an appropriate readout of a complex system. lncRNAs have no known function such as many lncRNAs. newer methodologies like gain-of-function, multiplexed library screens, and scRNA-seq have yet to be implemented in the interrogation of lncRNA functions in the context of viral infection. the next challenge is to experimentally validate their associated phenotype. inhibition studies are useful for studying candidate lncRNAs. RNAi, in the form of siRNA, degrades target RNA via DICER. antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), binds target RNA and promotes degradation via RNase H. lncRNA LOC389641 can be specifically inhibited by RNAi. the effect of a non-coding RNA may be independent of the transcript, but rely on the act of transcription to modulate a target. targeting lncRNA with incomplete genomic annotations with the CRISPR-Cas9 system may prove difficult, if not impossible. low expression levels can be particularly pronounced when an lncRNA is identified from a heterogeneous cell population. it is important to determine the cell types of origin for these lncRNAs. a natural choice for discovering specific lncRNAs is to systematically profile lncRNA changes in response to infection. lncRNAs lack poly(A) tails as many lncRNAs lack poly(A) tails. the expression of both poly(A+) and poly(A-) can be captured by the sequencing of total RNAs. limits to Total RNA-seq include the requirement of millions of additional sequencing reads to achieve a comparable coverage as mRNA-seq. the enriched fraction is subjected to sequencing, resulting in greatly increased target coverage [64]. this technique might be effective for profiling a list of target lncRNAs across a large number of samples. rhesus macaque and cynomolgus macaque genomes recovered thousands of ncRNA enriched intergenic loci in both rhesus macaque and cynomolgus macaque genomes. aligned reads can then be assembled into transcripts using tools such as Cufflinks [67], Scripture [68], or StringTie [69]. Depending on the completeness of the reference genome assembly, unmapped short reads lncRNA quantification should use transcript alignment-based methods like RSEM [79] or alignment-free methods like Salmon [80]. lncRNA quantification should use transcript alignment-based methods like RSEM [79] or RSEM [79]. existing scRNA-seq protocols can only capture polyadenylated transcripts, so many of the ploy(A-) lncRNAs will be missed. scRNA-seq has the potential to enable the identification of highly cell type specific lncRNAs that escape identification through current bulk sequencing strategies. scRNA-seq focuses on mRNAs (mRNA-seq) by enriching transcripts with poly(A) RNA capture sequencing (CaptureSeq, CAP-seq) uses custom-designed oligonucleotide probes to capture and enrich genes or regions of interest. the enriched fraction is subjected to sequencing, resulting in greatly increased target coverage [64]. in well-studied systems, there are large numbers of annotated lncRNAs. for example, there are 14,720 human lncRNA genes and 8980 mouse lncRNA genes in the current Ensembl annotation (release 90.38) lncRNA expression analysis can be carried out simultaneously just as all other coding genes. tools like Cuffcompare, part of the Cufflinks package [67] may be used to compare transcripts against reference annotations to separate novel from known genes. lncRNA quantification should use transcript alignment-based methods like RSEM [79] or alignment-free methods like Salmon [80]. studies of viral infection are often conducted on samples of mixed cell populations, resulting in an average population-level expression for each transcript. however, in doing so, the distinct functions of different cells may be overlooked. scRNA-seq is very similar to bulk RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) a typical RNA-seq analysis of virus infected samples may identify hundreds if not thousands of lncRNAs that respond to infection. some of the annotated lncRNAs have been researched through ad hoc experimentation. lncRNAs may play more important roles in the phenotype of interest. eq data was used to infer the functions of a set of HIV infection-related lncRNAs from the same RNA-seq data from mouse lung samples infected with either influenza A virus or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. the choice of a suitable method for calculating co-expressions may be guided by an initial assessment of co-expressions of genes annotated with similar functions. lncRNAs occupying key points (hubs or bottlenecks) in the derived networks may likely play important regulatory roles. lncRNAs may regulate the interferon response to viral infection. lncRNA-coding gene pair influence expression correlation of the pair. it is crucial to consider lncRNA baseline expression relative to its coding counterpart when performing the knockdown or overexpression of such an lncRNA. this prediction starts with expression data that simultaneously profiles both coding genes and lncRNAs across multiple conditions. all detected coding genes can be ranked by their correlation coefficients with the lncRNA. a network-based approach can be used to predict the functions of lncRNAs from the known functions within the same network. lncRNAs may have cis-regulatory effects on flanking genes. lncRNAs may have cis-regulatory effects on flanking genes. it is important to prioritize lncRNAs proximal to coding genes. lncRNAs have been previously categorized into subclasses, each with functions that reflect their evolutionary conservation. lncRNAs that occlude the transcription of coding genes through their own transcription typically lack sequence and structural conservation outside of those regions overlapping the promoter region. lncRNAs from Arabidopsis thaliana were syntenic with high sequence divergence in two closely related plant species [99] the existence of syntenic conservation confers functional significance, as it indicates cross-species selective pressure. slncky successfully identified the vast majority as homologous. a recent approach has made use of CMfinder in a computational pipeline that makes structural alignments to successfully capture conserved RNA structures. the method predicted CRSs for 22% of lncRNAs annotated in GENCODE v25, showing a higher density of CRSs at the 5\u2032 end of lncRNAs. the disparity between lncRNA exon and mRNA exon sequence conservation suggests that there is little selective constraint at this level [9] despite the lack of sequence conservation across species, there still exists many cases of functional conservation. positional information can aid sequence homology searches, whereby the homology of lncRNAs is inferred by their relative positioning near orthologous genes. conservation to functionally annotate lncRNAs prompted researchers to look at higher-order structures to infer functional significance. the lack of sequence conservation among most lncRNAs has also prompted researchers to look at higher-order structures to infer functional significance. lncRNAs assume higher-order structures with functional significance. the majority of lncRNAs still lack CRSs, making the search for conserved species highly stringent. the search strategy encompasses many divergent species, making the search for conserved CRSs highly stringent. dCas9 is mutated to an endonuclease-deficient form (dCas9) and fused to a repressive Kr\u00fcppel associated box (KRAB) motif. the resulting dCas9-KRAB inhibits transcription by directly blocking transcription machinery or through the activity of an effector domain, in this case KRAB [119]. weissman group expanded on that small library with a large scale CRISPRi library screen of lncRNA in seven different cell lines. between 28 and 438 lncRNAs were determined to cause a growth phenotype. between 28 and 438 lncRNAs were determined to cause a growth phenotype. a high-throughput gRNA library screen was able to identify gene activation affecting cell growth in K562 cells as proof-of-principle. dCas9-VPR was used to screen genes for gain-of-function. dCas9-VPR was shown to enhance the activation of the non-coding gene MIAT. single cell sequencing (scRNA-seq) as a readout represents a potential paradigm shift. a pooled screen only provides an association of the perturbation with the phenotype of interest. a pooled screen only provides an association of the perturbation with the phenotype of interest. dCas9-SunTag is fused to a peptide epitope which recruits co-expressed VP64 activation domains. dCas9-SunTag is fused to a peptide epitope which recruits co-expressed VP64 activation domains. this screen identified 13 genes that were then individually confirmed at the transcript and protein level. the assay relies on the expression of multiple gRNAs from a single plasmid or the expression of multiple plasmids, each with a single gRNA [127,128] it is also possible to combine gRNAs such that genes are activated and inhibited in parallel. the second round of screening could involve comparing the smaller library against itself or against the larger unbiased library [120,127]. a \u2018one-size-fits-all\u2019 assay can cover a wide range of phenotypes. it is unbiased and especially suitable for identifying associations between diseases and genes with no known function such as many lncRNAs. newer methodologies like gain-of-function, multiplexed library screens, and scRNA-seq have yet to be implemented in the interrogation. fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques have been used extensively to show their localization to nuclear paraspeckles. RNAi, in the form of siRNA, degrades target RNA via DICER and has been used in many instances to inhibit the expression of lncRNAs. the complexity of genomic regions of interest and the ability to target specific lncRNAs in a given region are also important considerations for validation studies. the complexity of genomic regions of interest and the ability to target specific lncRNAs in a given region are also important considerations for validation studies. low expression of lncRNAs is in part due to their cell-type specific expression. low expression levels can be particularly pronounced when an lncRNA is identified from a heterogeneous cell population, such as blood or tissues. techniques are providing novel tools for investigating lncRNA functions in specific areas including viral infection and rapidly expanding our knowledge of lncRNA functions. the proposed workflow includes three major phases: (1) broad discovery of infection associated lncRNAs; (2) annotation and prioritization of identified lncRNAs; (3) experimental validation of specific candidate lncRNAs. large-scale lncRNA screening is emerging as a powerful alternative. the next step is to narrow down the list to a small set of high interest lncRNAs (Prioritization phase), an extremely challenging task."}
