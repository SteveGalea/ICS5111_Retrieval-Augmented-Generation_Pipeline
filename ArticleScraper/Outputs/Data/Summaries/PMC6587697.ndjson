{"summary": "recent and future climate change in Canada Warming trends have accelerated globally, with overall annual air temperature increases of nearly 1 \u00b0C during the period 1880\u20132017 (5). the last three decades were warmer than any decade since 1850 (7). this trend varies geographically, with greater and faster warming over the Arctic and sub-Arctic basins, particularly in northeastern Canada. all simulations use the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5 greenhouse gas emission scenario (12) with a spatial resolution of 0.44 \u00b0 around 50 km. observed and projected annual changes in daily mean temperature. long-term changes in temperature and precipitation expected to be accompanied by increased variability in temperatures and rainfall from one year to the next. extreme weather events include heat waves and heavy rainfall events that increases the risks of flooding. fewer wet days per year is anticipated in northeastern canada where warming will be more pronounced over the course of the 21st century. effects of climate change on ecosystems, including effects on biodiversity, may alter the risk of a new zoonoses originating from wildlife. effects of climate change may have indirect impacts on disease emergence and re-emergence, by affecting other environmental and social changes. both infectious and chronic disease risks will need to be considered together (25) the risk from infectious diseases comprises two aspects: the likelihood of exposure and sensitivity (i.e. severity of infection outcome) the severity of infectious disease outcomes will likely be greater in populations that are increasingly elderly and affected by chronic diseases."}
