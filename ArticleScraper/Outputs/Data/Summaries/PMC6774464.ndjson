{"summary": "female athymic nude rats were used in a study to induce, treat, and analyze metastatic tumors of the brain and spinal cord. rats were socially housed in autoclaved, static microisolation cages with corncob bedding and enrichment on 12:12-h dark:light cycle. rats were free of toolan H1 virus (rat parvovirus), Kilham rat virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, Mycoplasma the lesions were grossly identified as small, cystic structures. the cysts and haired skin were placed in neutral, buffered formalin. the spheres were noted to be attached to the skin. nodules and formalin solution were analyzed by using LC-MS/MS. chemicals and reagents included methyl tert-butyl ether, acetonitrile, ammonium hydroxide and buprenorphine. the supernatant was reconstituted in 80 L of acetonitrile (5%) and transferred to an autosampler vial for LC-MS/MS analysis. LC-MS/MS was performed by using a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with an electrospray ionization source. the injection volume was 10 L for each sample. methyl tert-butyl ether, acetonitrile and ammonium hydroxide were analyzed. LC-MS/MS analysis was performed by using a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. electrospray ionization source was coupled to an Express C18 column. cell phases A and B were used to elute the analyte from the column. all MS/MS data were collected in positive ion mode. the cysts contained variable accumulations of a light pink, proteinaceous fluid. the cause for the cysts was not evident histologically; there was no evidence of neoplasia. the 37 rats that reached the experimental end point were unable to break down the polymer vesicle to release the buprenorphine for absorption. histologically, it appeared that the rats had walled off the polymer with fibrous connective tissue. this response created a dead-space artifact in the subcutaneous tissue. LC-MS/MS clearly showed that the formalin fluid contained buprenorphine, which had been released from the dissolved polymer during tissue fixation in the neutral buffered formalin. our method did not measure the amount of buprenorphine in the solution, but the gross appearance of the vesicle suggested considerable buprenorphine remained in the vesicle."}
