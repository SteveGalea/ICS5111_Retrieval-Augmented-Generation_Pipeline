{"summary": "in the last few years, it is estimated that in europe there were almost 3 000 000 cancer cases diagnosed (excluding non melanoma skin cancers) in the last few years, it is estimated that there were almost 3 000 000 cancer cases diagnosed (excluding non melanoma skin cancers) and more than 1 500 000 deaths from cancer each year [2]. the use of naked plasmid DNA as vaccine provides practical benefits for large-scale vaccine production. new technologies including gene-expression profiling have increased the list of candidate tumor antigens. shared antigens or tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) are expressed by more than one type of tumor cells. a number of TAA are also expressed on normal tissues. a biological issue limiting the efficacy of cancer vaccines is the low immunogenicity of cancer antigens. strategies to enhance antigen immunogenicity are discussed in a later section. plasmid DNA vaccines are simple vehicles for in vivo transfection and antigen production. ll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) is a receptor found on mice and primate immune cells. this nonspecific immune response increases the antigen-specific immune response. the antigen encoded by the plasmid is produced in host cells. a series of studies investigated the source of Ag presentation. cross-presentation from these sites to APCs is the major route to priming. antigen-loaded APCs travel to the draining lymph nodes, where they present peptide antigens to nave T cells, thereby eliciting both humoral and cellular immune responses. plasmid DNA vaccines can induce antibodies and CD4+ T cell helper responses. viral mediated gene transfer by genetically modified lentiviruses, adenoviruses, adeno-associated viruses, and retroviruses is advantageous because of its high transfection efficiency and stability. viral methods are disadvantageous because of their high expense, toxic side effects, limits on transgene size, and potential for insertional mutagenesis. DNA vaccines are free of the problems associated with producing recombinant protein vaccines. they are also safer than live attenuated which can cause pathogenic infection in vivo. the ability to introduce antigen to the host immune system is a unique feature of DNA vaccines. the use of codon-optimized sequences instead of wild-type coding sequences is a general and potent method to improve vaccination. the use of codon-optimized sequences is a general and potent method to improve vaccination. the synthetic gene is optimal for expression and consequently for the induction of an immune response. design coupled with the technology of gene manipulation allows also \u201cgene optimization\u201d. the variable regions of the heavy (VH) and light chain of the tumor immunoglobulin can be readily cloned and combined into single-chain variable fragment (scFv) format. the backbone of bacterial DNA includes cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) unmethylated regions as sequence motifs that stimulate innate immunity. epitope sequences can be modified to increase the affinity of the epitope peptide for the MHC molecule. this strategy can greatly increase the potency of a vaccine and convert a subdominant epitope into a dominant one by making it more competitive for available MHC molecules. vaccines encoding immunostimulatory RNA, such as double-stranded RNA, were also generated. the central question is whether DNA vaccines can activate and maintain the high level of immunity required to suppress cancer cell growth. the pivotal position of CD4 T helper (Th) cells in helping B cells to produce antibody and control induction and maintenance of CD8 T cells has led investigators to focus on their importance in responses to DNA vaccination. DNA vaccines offer the opportunity to activate Th cells and to dramatically amplify immunity against tumor cells. granulocyte\u2013macrophage colony\u2013stimulating factor (GM-CSF), a molecule able to enhance immune responses by inducing proliferation, maturation, and migration of DCs. one of the common cytokines employed in plasmid DNA vaccine is granulocyte\u2013macrophage colony\u2013stimulating factor (GM-CSF) vaccination with DNA constructs encoding a fusion protein generated superior protection against a large tumor challenge (20 times the minimum lethal dose), as compared with the best available protein vaccines. a strategy to activate Th cells for inducing antitumor immunity is to engage a repertoire against nontolerized antigens. gene gun delivery involves adhering naked DNA to gold beads and shooting particles through a high-pressured instrument. this system delivers DNA directly into skin and Langerhans cells in a highly efficient process. electroporation-based DNA delivery technology dramatically enhances cellular uptake of DNA vaccines. the tattoo device has a cartridge of nine fine metal perforating needle that oscillate at a constant high frequency and puncture the skin. the expression of reporter genes results in robust T-cell responses. prime-boost regimens have shown promise in eliciting greater immune response in humans compared with DNA vaccination alone. heterologous prime-boost regimens are among the most potent strategies to induce cellular immune responses. boosting a primary response with a heterologous vector will result in 4\u201310-fold higher T cell responses. EP may provide a prime-boost combination equivalent to that observed using viral vectors. Tregs are a potential barrier to developing immune therapies for cancer. they can suppress immune responses through the secretion of suppressive cytokines like TGF- and IL- 35. evasive mechanisms adopted by malignant cells to prevent immune function are numerous. combining cancer vaccination with angiogenesis inhibition is appealing, due to favorable safety profile of both approaches, as well as possible biological synergies. the concept of combining cancer vaccination with angiogenesis inhibition is appealing, due to favorable safety profile of both approaches. the use of codon-optimized sequences is a general and potent method to improve vaccination. an optimal coding sequence is determined back from the amino acid sequence of the antigen by algorithms that take into account the abundance of specific tRNAs in the cytosol of human cells. the coadministration of genes encoding ligands for TLRs or their signaling molecules has been shown to improve the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines. a process termed epitope enhancement is expected to make the sequences of many epitopes of cancer more immunogenic. DNA vaccines can be designed to induce an appropriate effector pathway, including antibody against cell-surface antigens, or CTL response against intracellular antigens expressed only as MHC class I-associated peptides. key question is whether DNA vaccines can activate and maintain the high level of immunity required to suppress cancer cell growth. progress has been made in developing improved techniques for encapsulating plasmid DNA (liposomes, polymers, and microparticles) progress has been made in developing improved techniques for encapsulating plasmid DNA (liposomes, polymers, and microparticles) granulocyte\u2013macrophage colony\u2013stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a molecule able to enhance immune responses by inducing proliferation, maturation, and migration of DCs. fusion genes can create single vaccines capable of multiple functions. the effectiveness of DNA vaccination in vivo could be greatly increased. the use of xenogeneic antigen to break tolerance is likely due to the presence of some foreign sequences in the xenogeneic antigen that are able to activate Th cells. the principle has been applied to realize the DNA fusion gene vaccines encoding the tumor antigen linked to an antigen derived from tetanus toxin. electroporation-based DNA delivery technology dramatically enhances cellular uptake of DNA vaccines. EP works as an adjuvant to enhance necessary \u201cdanger signals\u201d that become detectable by the immune system. the tissue damage caused by the application of EP causes inflammation and recruits DCs, macrophages, and lymphocytes to the injection site. adenovirus, vaccinia virus, fowlpox and recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus have been tested as booster vaccines. recombinant protein antigens match with antigens used in DNA prime immunization. heterologous prime-boost regimens are among the most potent strategies to induce cellular immune responses. tumor microenvironment is established through the activity of myeloid and lymphoid regulatory cells, as well as through the production of immune-suppressive factors by malignant cells themselves. many tumor-infiltrating macrophages, referred to myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), exert powerful anti-inflammatory effects. s and often secrete immunosuppressive molecules to defend themselves against attack. the hurdles to successful reversal of tolerance and induction of effective immunity are becoming clear and vaccines must incorporate elements to overcome them. d DNA augments the immunogenicity of the vaccine, mobilizing and activating large numbers of DCs at the site of inoculation [128]. d DNA is an attractive prospect, supported by abundant data in mice and by preliminary human trials [133\u2013135]. additional strategies aimed to alter regulatory T cell function in cancer immunotherapy have already proven successful in preliminary studies. the use of gene-based vaccines could lead to an efficient method to use the immune system against cancer. the inclusion of FrC sequence, or other nonself antigens, activates T-cell help to reverse tolerance and induces high levels of immunity [47, 64, 65]. open NCT00859729 18 functionality of DNA recruiting vaccine delivery system Determine the Absence of toxicity Brief and feasibility and safety Open CD8+ T-cell acceptable UK-112 20 Determine the reactivity against the pain at the immunological responses target peptide injection site PAP-specific IFN gamma-secreting NCT00582140 22 Determine the safety Completed CD8+ T-cells (Aug 2009) PAP-specific CD4+ and/or CD8+ T-cell proliferation the first phase I/II trial of idiotypic vaccination for follicular B-cell lymphoma was conducted by Hawkins and colleagues. plasmid DNA was able to develop cellular or/and humoral antiidiotype immune responses in 38% of patients in remission following chemotherapy. study will assess feasibility and safety of vaccination with increasing doses of xenogenic DNA coding for the Rhesus Prostate Specific Antigen (rhPSA), a protein that is 89% homologous to human PSA. a phase I/II, dose escalation, DNA vaccination trial with plasmid DNA, fused to a domain (DOM1) of tetanus toxin, was performed in patients with relapsed prostate cancer. prostate cancer patients were prime-boosted with alternate injections of recombinant adenoviral vector expressing PSMA and plasmid DNA encoding PSMA and CD86. after 36-month observation period from the first vaccine injection, 86% of participants developed anti-PSMA antibody. no intramuscular or intradermal injection was capable of raising cellular immune reactivity or a significant incidence of antitumor effects [57]. Increasing results were obtained in a phase II study with interleukin-2 cytokines as adjuvant used in combination with same vaccination protocols (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00019448) and in a phase II trial with human GM-CSF plasmid DNA in conjunction with a multipeptide vaccine en coadministration of plasmids DNA encoding murine alpha fetoprotein (AFP) and murine GM-CSF was followed by boosting with an AFP-expressing nonreplicating adenoviral vector [60] leading to tumor protective immunity. early studies were applied in a phase I/II clinical trial in patients with HLA-A*0201-expressing stage II\u2013IVA hepatocellular carcinoma. antigen-presenting cell populations and blood samples are examined for the presence of memory markers to demonstrate the development of HER2 ICD memory immunity. a third series of vaccinations was carried out using human GM-CSF DNA mixed with Id DNA. the department of Oncology of the University Hospital of Uppsala is recruiting participants for a phase I/II trial. intradermal EP (DERMA VAX) will be used as a delivery system. it will assess the feasibility and safety of vaccination with increasing doses of xenogenic DNA coding for the Rhesus Prostate Specific Antigen. 14% of patients developed PAP-specific IFN gamma-secreting CD8+ T-cells immediately after the treatment course. 41% of patients developed PAP-specific CD4+ and/or CD8+ T-cell proliferation, confirming preclinical studies. gene plasmids encoding melanoma-melanocyte antigen alone were administered in patients with metastatic melanoma. neither intramuscular nor intradermal injection was capable of raising cellular immune reactivity or a significant incidence of antitumor effects. gen are essential for transformation and are coexpressed in HPV-associated lesions hence they represent ideal targets for the development of HPV therapeutic vaccines. preclinical studies showed mice were successfully DNA-based immunized [147] in a prime-boost approach. with advanced stage HER2 overexpressing breast and ovarian cancers patients receive HER2 ICD protein treatment intradermally at 6 months postvaccination. the injection site is biopsied and examined for infiltrating T-cell and antigen-presenting cell populations. blood samples are examined for the presence of memory markers to demonstrate the development of HER2 ICD memory immunity. in the next years an increasing number of DNA vaccines will enter more advanced phases of human studies. therapeutic regimens composed of optimal vaccine formulations with combinations of immunotherapy agents and delivery strategies could offer hope to patients suffering from incurable cancer that current standard therapies cannot provide alone."}
