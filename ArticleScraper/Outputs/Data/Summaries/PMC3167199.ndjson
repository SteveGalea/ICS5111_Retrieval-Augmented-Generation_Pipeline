{"summary": "Sulfur mustard \"bis (2-chlroethyl) sulphide\" is a chemical warfare agent that remains a threat to human health. the aim of this study was to identify protein expression signature or biomarkers that reflect chronic lung damages induced by SM exposure. haptoglobin isoforms were detected in plasma of all lung disease patients but none of the healthy controls. proteomics technologies can identify and quantify novel proteins in the plasma that can function as biomarkers of the presence or severity of disease states. albumin is present at about 40 mg/ml and several other proteins are highly abundant including transferrin and fibrinogen. plasma proteins and peptides are from almost every tissue and cell. changes in quantity and quality are specific not only to the tissue affected by disease, but also to the disease process itself. representative 2-DE images of plasma profiles from a healthy control for 50% (v/v) ethanol precipitate and ethanol supernatant are shown in Figure 2A and 2B respectively. most of the small molecular weight proteins in the range of 15-50 kDa, have significantly higher spot volume and intensity in ethanol supernatant rather than precipitate. intensity % Volume % intensity 1 2 HS glycoprotein 10 1.4 23 1.8** 8 1.2 13 1.6 2 1-antitrypsin 160 14 67 6.4 170 23 59 4.7 3 Zinc 2 glycoprotein 36 4.6** 46 4.2** 12 2.1 19 4.8 4 SP40 20

(spots 21, 22 and 23) were only detected in the plasma of the patients but none of the healthy controls. serum Amyloid A1 isoforms (spots 24 and 26) were only seen in the plasma of the patients but were not detectable in healthy controls. haptoglobin is present in normal human plasma at a concentration range of 0.3-1.9 mg/ml, accounting for 0.4-2.6% of total plasma protein. haptoglobin is an inflammation-inducible plasma protein. it consists of 2 different types of chains and a single type of chain connected by disulfide bridges. haptoglobin isoforms and fragments are also elevated in plasma of severe acute respiratory syndrome patients. haptoglobin plays a crucial role in defense against hemoglobin-induced oxidative stress by a mechanism thought to involve its high-affinity binding with hemoglobin. however, it has yet to be shown that haptoglobin itself is an antioxidant molecule [23]. this is the first study of plasma fluid proteome in SM exposed subjects. this is the first study of plasma fluid proteome in SM exposed subjects. the patterns of differentially expressed proteins identified in SM exposed patients are somewhat different from other lung diseases. blood samples were drawn into tubes containing K2EDTA and then immediately centrifuged at 1300 g and 4\u00b0C for 10 min. samples were then frozen in aliquots and stored at -80\u00b0C until used. plasma samples were thawed at room temperature and centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 min. ethanol supernatants and pellets were reconstituted in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% (w/v) SDS, 0.1% (w/v) bromophenol blue and 10% (v/v) glycerol. gels were electrophoresed at 30 V for 30 min and then at 50 mA per gel for 45 min. gels were run in a running buffer, containing 25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, and 0.1% (w/v) SDS at 2W/gel for 45 min. gels were fixed overnight in acetic acid, methanol, water, 10:45:45 (v/v) and stained with colloidal Coomassie brilliant blue (CBB) G-250 as described previously. trypsin digestion and MALDI TOF MS/MS analysis were performed using a Bruker Autoflex III MALDI TOF/TOF instrument (Alphalyse, Denmark) the spectra were combined and used for a database search using the Mascot software (Matrix science, version 2.2.03) the patients were classified as severe lung diseases condition. a group of 20 healthy age-matched male individuals was used as the control. none of the participants had a history of allergy or asthma. plasma samples were thawed at room temperature and centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. plasma samples were equilibrated to 4\u00b0C by gentle mixing. pellets were briefly re-centrifuged and any residual supernatant was removed. gels were electrophoresed at 30 V for 30 min and then at 50 mA per gel for 45 min. gels were centrifuged at 10,000 g at room temperature for 5 min. gels were run in a running buffer, containing 25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine and 0.1% (w/v) SDS at 2W/gel for 45 min. gels were fixed overnight in acetic acid, methanol, water, 10:45:45 (v/v) and stained with colloidal Coomassie brilliant blue (CBB) G-250 as described previously. scanned gels were scanned in transmission scan mode using bio-Rad GS-800 calibrated densitometer. protein identification was based on a combination of the peptide mass fingerprint (PMF) with peptide masses, and several MS/MS spectra of selected peptides in each MALDI MS spectrum. other modifications and isoforms are not considered in this analysis. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors' contributions HM carried out study design, analysis of
