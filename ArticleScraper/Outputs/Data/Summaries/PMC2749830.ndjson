{"summary": "genus Torovirus belongs to the family Coronaviridae in the order Nidovirales. these viruses have a linear positive-sense ssRNA genome encoding a large replicase polyprotein that is expressed from the genomic RNA (ORF1a and via ribosomal frameshifting, an ORF1a-ORF1b fusion product) the null model is responsible for the broad smoothing of the conservation scores at the 3' end of ORFX. positive scores favour the alternative model and in the +0 frame (B7) there is a strong coding signature throughout ORF1a except where ORF1a is overlapped by ORFX. NC_007447 and DQ310701 ORF1a amino acid sequences were aligned with CLUSTALW [13] and back-translated to produce a nucleotide sequence alignment. however these two viruses are reasonably divergent (mean nucleotide identity within ORF1a 68%) this provides robust statistics for comparative methods of gene prediction. the absence of stop codons may be linked to local nucleotide biases. the mean nucleotide frequencies within ORFX (Breda virus) are A 28%, C 24%, G 20% and U 27% compared with A 27%, C 14%, G 23% and U 36% in the rest of ORF1a. simplest explanation for these nucleotide biases is simply the presence of an overlapping gene (i.e. ORFX an overlapping gene, viz. ORFX, provides the most obvious explanation for the high conservation seen here. however, recombination does not provide an explanation for the other evidence presented in this report. in Breda virus (NC_007447), the annotated ORF1a AUG initiation codon is at nucleotide coordinates 859..861 and the first ORFX-frame AUG codon is at coordinates 1110..1112. however leaky scanning to this AUG codon is unlikely due to intervening AUG codons in the ORF1a frame. downstream sequence is predicted to fold into a hairpin structure that is identical between Breda initiation at the upstream CUG codon would give ORFX the nucleotide coordinates 774..1547 in NC_007447 and 776..1549 in DQ310701, resulting in a 258 amino acid product with a molecular mass of 30 kDa which, for want of a better designation, tentatively name '30K' authors' contributions AEF carried out the bioinformatic analysis. both authors edited and approved the final manuscript."}
