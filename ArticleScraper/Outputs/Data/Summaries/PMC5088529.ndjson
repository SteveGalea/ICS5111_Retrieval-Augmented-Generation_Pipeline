{"summary": "two rules of complementarity guide base pairing in DNA and RNA. the rules are size complementarity (large purines pair with small pyrimidines) and hydrogen-bonding complementarity (hydrogen bond donors, D, pair with hydrogen bond acceptors, A) we were not the first to hypothesize that an expanded genetic alphabet might be obtained by shuffling hydrogen-bonding units. we were not the first to hypothesize that an expanded genetic alphabet might be obtained by shuffling hydrogen-bonding units. even the writers of the movie E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial understood the possibility of an expanded genetic alphabet. synthesis as an activity was necessary to determine whether nucleobase pairing was as simple as the Watson\u2013Crick model implied. the first heterocyclic system prepared to implement each of the four additional hydrogen-bonding patterns turned out not to be the best heterocycle to support genetics. synthesis delivered heterocycles that adequately implemented the four extra hydrogen-bonding pairing patterns. if E.T. indeed had inosine in his/her genome, he would have had difficulty surviving. some second-order Watson\u2013Crick pairing rules obtained via artificially expanded genetic information systems (AEGIS) development. a negative charge in the nucleobase stack destabilizing. a small:small pair joined by three hydrogen bonds stabilized the duplex as much as a small:large pair joined by just two hydrogen bonds. four or six Z:P pairs retain overall Watson\u2013Crick geometry. isolated pair in a short, A-form DNA duplex crystallized with the aid of a selenium substitution. a single pair in an RNA riboswitch in four views A, B, C, and D rotated 90\u00b0. standard Watson\u2013Crick pairing was used to capture the viral sequence on the solid support. then, in a \u201csandwich\u201d format, standard Watson\u2013Crick pairing allowed the immobilized viral sequence to capture a second DNA molecule. the second DNA molecule then captured a b-DNA molecule, which captured multiple signaling molecules. cleotides containing AEGIS components showed that the Watson\u2013Crick model could be generalized to increase orthogonal pairs. synthesis going on at the same time was showing the importance of the repeating charge in the backbone to molecular recognition. a linear genetic biopolymer was likely to require a repeating backbone charge. polymerases have four natural substrates: A(template):T-triphosphate, T(template):A-triphosphate, G(template):C-triphosphate, and C(template):G-triphosphate. contact in the major groove might cause a polymerase to prefer some nucleotides over others, disregarding instructions from the template. polymerases would readily synthesize duplex DNA containing Z:P pairs from templates and triphosphates. relatively few would synthesize the S:B, K:X, and V:J pairs. polymerases that are first mutated often best replicated by polymerases. a library of genes encoding active (blue) and inactive (red) polymerases is cloned into bacterial cells. the polymerases are dispersed into an emulsion where the extracellular buffer contains PCR primers and triphosphates. after the target-specific primers are consumed, the nested PCR is \u201ccarried\u201d by external primers containing AEGIS components. the pattern of amino acid replacement in natural history can be used to guide protein engineering and directed evolution experiments. replacement at sites with low-level of replacements typically leads to inactivation of the polymerase. the PCR is initiated with low concentrations of chimeric primers with 3\u2032-ends complementary to the target (natural) sequence. the initial rounds of PCR create amplicons carrying complementary AEGIS sequences at their ends. after the small amounts of chimeric primers are consumed, the PCR is carried by large amounts of \u201cexternal\u201d AEGIS primers complementary to these tags. nested PCR is very clean, even in a multiplexed form. artificially expanded genetic information systems (AEGIS) conversion supports an assay that allows 22 different arboviral RNA sequences to be sought in a single mosquito carcass. this gives high and uniform detection of the amplicons arising from whatever RNA virus might be present. a gene alphabet should allow the writing of more amino acid \u201cwords\u201d in the protein \u201clexicon\u201d. using the first-generation AEGIS S and B \u201cletters\u201d to support the codon:anticodon interaction in mRNA and tRNA molecules allowed an AEGIS mRNA molecule to encode a 21st amino acid in in vitro translation. s using artificially expanded genetic information systems (AEGIS) pairs to assemble the strands without their forming hairpins or other undesired structures. the added information density of a six-letter polymer diminishes assembly ambiguity. this allows shorter fragments to be used, which in turn recognizes that the longer the synthetic fragment, the greater the chance of error. the availability of polymerases that replicate AEGIS nucleotides makes it possible to apply laboratory in vitro evolution experiments. the approach follows in vitro selection experiments applied to four-letter nucleic acids by Szostak, Ellington, Gold, Joyce, and others. survivors were sequenced and resynthesized for study. a gene library was used in an experiment to find AEGIS nucleotides. a counterselection against untransformed liver cells was used to remove nonspecific binders. binders emerged from the same experiment that had neither Z nor P. these had systematically weaker affinity for the cells, all with Kdiss values that were >200 nm. if combined with natural enzymes, AEGIS provides many of the properties that we value in a genetic system. if combined with natural enzymes, AEGIS forms duplexes with sequence specificity, directs its own replication, and can evolve. if combined with natural enzymes, AEGIS has value, not only for what it has taught us about the intimate connection between molecular structure and genetics. natural polymerases that manage natural DNA can be obtained inexpensively. moving beyond the natural also requires the development of new synthetic pipelines to create triphosphates and phosphoramidites. but moving synthetic biology beyond \u201cthe natural\u201d is not without benefits. the unnatural kind of synthetic biology solves these problems. in return for its added effort, the unnatural kind of synthetic biology solves these problems."}
