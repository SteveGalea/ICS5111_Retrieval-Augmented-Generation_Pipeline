{"summary": "the concept of an ICU quickly spread around the world. it can trace its roots to the successful use of mechanical ventilation during the polio epidemic in 1952. since the late 1960's, most US hospitals have maintained at least 1 ICU. CCM board eligibility can be obtained for physicians with IM training alone through a two-year fellowship; for IM physicians with training in another IM subspecialty, one year of CCM fellowship training is required. the majority of training programs that lead to CCM board eligibility in the united states are the traditional three-year pulmonary/critical care medicine programs. a minimum 2-year fellowship in ID and 1 year in CCM is required by the ACGME. 90% of CCM-ID candidates have certified in CCM after ID training. more than half of ICU patients receive at least 1 antibiotic during their stay in the ICU. a large proportion of ID consults occur in ICU patients. the number of hospitalized patients with AIDS has declined. a growing number of other types of patients with compromised immune systems require critical care services. a study using Medicare claims data found that ID intervention in patients with 11 serious but common infectious diagnoses was associated with better outcomes and lower costs of care. a significant reduction (by 3.7% fewer days) in ICU length of stay as well as 30-day hospital readmission rates, and that the benefit was highest when patients were seen earlier in their course. the ICU has been on the frontline of emerging infectious diseases. the recent outbreak highlights some of the advantages of having dual trained specialists involved in both clinical and research arenas. dual training in CCM and ID is clearly not a requirement to participate in research in any of these areas. the proportion of certified ID programs with unfilled positions has risen over the last 3 years from 34% in 2013 to 51% in 2015. fewer graduates are pursuing IM, and within IM, many residents are more attracted to the procedure-oriented specialties that command higher salaries. fewer graduates are pursuing IM, and within IM, many residents are more attracted to the procedure-oriented specialties that command higher salaries. the ID community should consider additional training in CCM as synergistic. there are approximately 50 000 new diagnoses of human immunodeficiency virus and 15 000 deaths in patients with AIDS per year in the united states. a lack of available jobs would stymie the field even if more CCM-ID fellows were trained. dual-trained graduates in both community and academic settings have often had to steer their practice toward one of the 2 specialties. despite a conspicuous dearth in training programs offering dual training in CCM and ID, there has been a sharp rise in CCM-ID graduates over the last 2 decades."}
