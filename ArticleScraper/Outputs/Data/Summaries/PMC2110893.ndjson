{"summary": "the CEA gene family codes for such proteins and acts as cellular receptors for pathogens. the gene coding for the ITIM-bearing immunoregulatory molecule CEACAM1 gave rise to a recent expansion of the canine CEA gene family. however, most of the CEACAMs represent ITAM-bearing transmembrane proteins. the evolution of immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) members is largely influenced by the nature of their ligands. the extracellular part of IgSF members are well conserved. the extracellular domains of members expressed by immune cells or cells involved in reproduction tend to diversify much more rapidly. the transmembrane-bound CEACAM2 (in mice), CEACAM17 (in mice and rats) and the secreted members CEACAM9, CEACAM10, CEACAM11, CEACAM12, CEACAM13, CEACAM14, CEACAM15 (in mice and rats) exist in rodents. CAM1 contains two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIM) in its cytoplasmic domain. one CEACAM1 ITIM is replaced by an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motif (ITSM) in mice and rats. bacterial pathogens can down-regulate immune functions by binding to CEACAM1. high-quality draft genome sequence of the domestic dog provided the possibility to analyze the complete CEA gene family in a third mammalian order. based on sequence analyses and comparison of expression profiles we suggest that CEACAM28 and CEACAM1 are paired activating and inhibitory immune receptors involved in the regulation of T cell responses. sporadic recurrence of selective pressure mediated by species-specific pathogens was the driving force for the evolution of multiple ITAM-bearing CEA both CEACAM19 and CEACAM20 contain presumed ITAM consensus sequences in their cytoplasmic domains. however, as for human CEACAM18, no cytoplasmic domain exon 1 present in human CEACAM19 was found [3]. a similar arrangement to that found for the human CEA gene family on chromosome 19q13. it is partially different from that found for the murine CEA gene family on chromosome 7. a similar arrangement is found for the human extended Leukocyte Receptor Complex. genes clustered with the sequences of the transmembrane domain exons of human CEACAM3, CEACAM4 and CEACAM21. they are connected to cytoplasmic domain exons encoding a C-terminal ITAM motif (CEACAM3 and CEACAM4) or a homologous truncated cytoplasmic domain with a premature stop (CEACAM21) ic domain exons 1\u20133 are present in CEACAM29 the loss of the splice donor site in the cytoplasmic domain exon 2 leads to read through into the adjacent intron and truncation by a stop codon following after five codons. cytoplasmic domain exons terminate prematurely due to a stop codon at the end of cytoplasmic domain exon 2 and loss of the splice donor site in cytoplasmic domain exon the cytoplasmic domain exons Cyt1-Cyt4 are encoded by the cytoplasmic domain exons Cyt1-Cyt4 from dog CEACAM1-related proteins. the exon types are indicated by differently colored boxes. the size of the 3'-UTR is inferred from the position of the first putative polyadenylation signal sequence after the stop codon. the lowest value is observed for CEACAM1 N domains (56% and 42% for human and mouse, respectively. the highest value is observed for the CEACAM16 N2 domain (92 and 96% for human and mouse, respectively. cloning and sequencing of full-length canine CEACAM1 clones from a mix-breed dog revealed a complete 279 bp CEACAM1 A1 exon. the largest clone contains an open reading frame of 1563 bp coding for a 521 amino acid protein. the largest clone contains an open reading frame of 1563 bp coding for a 521 amino acid protein. mRNA encoding the splice variant with the short cytoplasmic tail CEACAM1-4S (GenBank accession no. DQ975209) differs from CEACAM1-4L mRNA by the absence of the 53 bp nucleotide cytoplasmic domain exon1 that leads to a frame shift and to the use of a TGA stop codon in cytoplasmic domain exon 2 as found for CEACAM1 of other species. three out of four clones encode cytoplasmic domains which contain the predicted ITAM motif. in one clone, the absence of the 53 nucleotide cytoplasmic domain exon 1 leads to a frame shift and the usage of an alternative stop codon located in cytoplasmic domain exon3. the number of Ig-related domains and presence of either a long (L) or short cytoplasmic domain (S) are indicated above the schematic representation of the proteins. potential signal consensus motifs in the cytoplasmic domains are indicated as red (ITIM), yellow (ITSM) and blue dots (ITAM) all other members of this subgroup either lack one of these exons or contain exons corrupted by nonsense, frame shift or splice site mutations leading to smaller predicted proteins. the ligand specificity of CEACAM28 seems to be most closely related to that of CEACAM1 in only two positions. the N domain amino acid sequence of CEACAM28 differs from that of CEACAM1 in only two positions. ide sequences from all CEACAM members of the human and dog CEA gene families (A) or dog CEACAM exons encoding IgC-like domains (B) were aligned and the results depicted as rooted dendrograms. the human and dog N domain exon sequences from CEACAM1-related genes are shown in blue and red, the ones from other CEACAM genes in black. this indicates selective pressure for divergence of N domain sequences during evolution. the amino acid (A; below the diagonal) and nucleotide sequences (N; above the diagonal) of IgV-like domain exons were aligned. all analyzed CEACAM1-related genes were found to be expressed in spleen. CEACAM1, CEACAM23, CEACAM25, CEACAM28 and CEACAM30 transcripts were detected in bone marrow and CEACAM24. in liver, the presence of mainly CEACAM1 and CEACAM23 transcripts could be demonstrated. cfCEACAM1C3-r 5'-AGTTCTGGCCTTCCACCTG 5'-GGATGAGGAGGCTGAAGTTG N domain Cyt 3 270 cfCEACAM1N-f cfCEACAM1N-f cfCEACAM1N-f cfCEACAM1N-f cfCEACAM1N-f cfaCC23-N-fo cfaCC23-N- cfaCC28-N-fo cfaCC28-T-re 5'-TTTGAAACTGCACTAATACGG 5'-TTGTGTGGAGACA N domain TM domain 703 (427) cfCEACAM1-5i-f cfaCC28-3-re 5'-CGGCAGCTGCTCTCACC 5'-GGAAGGAGAAGTGTCATGAGGT 5'-UTR 3'-UTR 1374 (1095) sequence determination of the CEACAM28 PCR products revealed simultaneous detection of CEACAM28 and CEACAM30 cDNAs (till then unknown). expression of CEACAM1-related CEACAMs by immune cells, we isolated T cells from PBMC by MACS sorting using CD4- and CD8-specific mAbs. RNA was isolated from purified lymphocyte populations. gene-specific primers located in the N domain and transmembrane exons were used for CEACAM1 cDNA amplification. downstream homologous region of 1,700 bp demarcated by a SINE element in CEACAM28 exhibits a similarity of 92%. the occurrence of such a regionally restricted gene conversion event is also supported by the high degree of amino acid sequence similarity of the leader (100%) and N domain (98%) the homologous CEACAM1 A2 domains share only 88% and 86% of their amino acid sequence with that of the homologous CEACAM1 A2 domain families are located within the expanded leukocyte receptor complex on chromosome 19q13 and chromosome 7 respectively. their predicted full length mRNA sequences encode proteins with domain organizations identical with their human and murine counterparts. as for human CEACAM18, no cytoplasmic domain exon 1 present in human CEACAM19 was found. the murine Psg genes are located between Hif3a and Pglyrp1 spanning nearly 1.8 Mbp. in dog, however, the distance between Hif3a and PGLYRP1 comprises only 0.1 Mbp. there is not enough space between XRCC1 and CEACAM23 (0.2 Mbp) to accommodate an expanded PSG gene family. transmembrane exons of the CEACAM1-related canine genes clustered with the sequences of the transmembrane exons of human and mouse CEACAM genes as query sequences. the sequence of the transmembrane exon of canine CEACAM1 clustered with transmembrane sequences from murine Ceacam1 and ceacam2 and with a group of exons coding for hydrophobic GPI signal peptides we screened about 2,000 bp of nucleotide sequence downstream of predicted canine transmembrane domain exons for the presence of the short cytoplasmic exons. small cytoplasmic domain exons similar to those found in human CEACAM3 and CEACAM4 could be identified, which encode ITAM motifs close to the C-terminal end. all transmembrane domain exons boxed red are followed by exons encoding cytoplasmic domains with an ITAM except for CEACAM21 and CEACAM29. their cytoplasmic domains terminate prematurely due to a stop codon at the end of cytoplasmic domain exon 2 and loss of the splice donor site. s/insertions in exons causing reading frame shifts or mutational corrupted splice donor and acceptor consensus sequences are indicated by an asterisk. no leader exon could be identified for CEACAM23 because of a sequence gap (indicated by brackets) the genes are arranged in the order and orientation as found on dog chromosome 1. cloning of full-length canine CEACAM1-related cDNAs revealed a complete 279 bp CEACAM1 A1 exon. the largest clone contains an open reading frame of 1563 bp coding for a 521. the longest canine splice variant was designated CEACAM1-4L (GenBank accession no. DQ975208) mRNA differs from the mRNA encoding the variant with the short cytoplasmic tail CEACAM1-4L (GenBank accession no. DQ975209) mRNA differs from the mRNA by the absence of the 53 bp nucleotide cytoplasmic domain exon1 that leads to a frame shift. CEACAM23 encodes four extracellular Ig-like domains, a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic tail. the major CEACAM24 cDNA encodes a protein with an N and a transmembrane domain. the cytoplasmic domain does not contain the expected ITAM motif due to the presence of the unspliced intron between the predicted cytoplasmic domain exons 3 and 4. two CEACAM30 splice variants were identified, both containing an ITAM motif in the cytoplasmic tail. they differ in the usage of alternative splice acceptor sites of the cytoplasmic domain exon 1. nucleotide sequences clustered with the human CEACAM1 N domain exon sequence except for CEACAM21 N. the close relationship between the new dog CEACAM1 genes and dog CEACAM1 could also be demonstrated when the A and B domain exon nucleotide sequences were compared. we calculated the ratio of nonsynonymous (Ka) to synonymous (Ks) nucleotide substitution rates on the branches of an N exon phylogenetic tree. the lowest Ka/Ks ratio (0.1) is observed for CEACAM28. the mature N domain amino acid sequences of dog CEA gene family members were aligned using the ClustalW program provided at the NPS server. identical amino acids are shown in red, conservatively exchanged amino acids in blue and green and non-conservative changes in black. the amino acid sequence positions which differ between CEACAM1 and the CEACAM1-related N domains are mapped to 3-D ribbon models calculated using the Geno3D-release 2 program. the degree of identity is indicated in %. all analyzed CEACAM1-related genes, (CEACAM1, CEACAM23, CEACAM24, CEACAM25, CEACAM28, and CEACAM30) were found to be expressed in spleen. ing and expression analyses of dog CEA family members gene oligonucleotide name oligonucleotide name oligonucleotide sequence location of primers (exon size of PCR product)* CEACAM1 cfCEACAM1-5i-f cfCEACAM1-3i-r 5'-CGGCAGCTGCTCTCACC 5'-CCAGCAGGTTGCAT 5'-UTR 3'-UTR 1624 CEA cfCEACAM1-5i-f cfaCC24-3-re 5'-CGGCAGCTGCTCTCACC 5'-GAGGGTGAAACT 5'-UTR 3'-UTR 1069 CEACAM25 cfaCC25-N-fo cfaCC25-N-fo cfaCC25-3-re 5'-CGGCAGCTGCTCTCACC 5'-TTTGAAACTGCACTAATACGG 5' sequence determination of the CEACAM28 PCR products revealed simultaneous detection of CEACAM1 and CEACAM28 cDNAs (till then unknown) RT-PCR analysis showed that resting T cells express CEACAM1, CEACAM28 and CEACAM30 mRNA simultaneously. the content of CEACAM28 mRNA seems to be reduced in T cells upon activation. in unstimulated T cells the CEACAM1/CEACAM28 ratio was 3. the ratio was > 7 and > 11 in T cells stimulated with IL-2 and anti-CD3 mAb. the near identity of the N domains between CEACAM1 and CEACAM28 is most likely due to a recent gene conversion event. the high similarity of this segment starts at position -984 of the 5'-flanking region and ends at position 114 of the intron between the Ndomain and the A1 domain exons. upstream of this segment, the sequence similarity between homologous regions of CEACAM28 and CEACAM1 drops to 80%. the homologous sequences upstream and downstream from the conserved region are less conserved (80% and 92%, respectively) (A) this can also be deduced from the degree of conservation of the amino acid sequences encoded by the leader, N and A domains. this can also be deduced from the degree of conservation of the amino acid sequences encoded by the leader, N and A domains which is much less outside of the gene conversion region. the ancestral members of the CEA gene family are located in three different loci (Figure 1). CEACAM16, CEACAM19 and CEACAM20 are close together. CEACAM1 is separated from this locus by more than 1 Mbp. a third locus (around the Hif3a gene) has been encroached by amplified CEACAM1-related genes. semi-allogeneic fetal trophoblast cells are less invasive and concomitantly less prone to encounter the maternal immune system in endotheliochorial placentae. therefore, PSG could be involved in regulation of trophoblast invasion and/or modulation of the maternal immune system as has been suggest before[3,36]. Alternatively, the function of the PSG could have been taken over by an unrelated gene family. a number of type I transmembrane IgSF members including CEACAMs and KIRs are composed of an extracellular \"environmental sensor\" and a carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic tail which can contain either inhibitory (ITIM) or activating motifs. a change in the receptor's signaling potential may be the result of an arms race between pathogens and the host immune system. m157 protein binds to the activating, DAP12-associating killer receptor Ly49H in MCMV-resistant mice leading to NKcell-mediated cytotoxicity. it was suggested that the activating receptor gene was derived from the gene encoding the inhibitory receptor to counteract a virus that exploits the inhibitory receptor during infection. this mechanism may apply to many other activating receptors that have inhibitory counterparts. CEACAM28 was probably formed from a CEACAM29 ancestor by a recent gene conversion encompassing the leader and the N exon from CEACAM1. the latter exon encodes the region most instrumental for ligand and pathogen binding in CEACAM molecules. this hypothesis raises questions about the driving force behind the fixation of other CEACAM1-related genes in the dog. receptors like CEACAM24 and CEACAM29 have lost the ITAM or gained new splice variants which do not contain an ITAM. the presence of multiple CEACAM1-related dog CEACAMs with ITAMs could reflect a repeated arms race between species-specific pathogens and the dog immune system.
