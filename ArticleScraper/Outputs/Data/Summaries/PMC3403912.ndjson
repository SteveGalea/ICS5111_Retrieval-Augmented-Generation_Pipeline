{"summary": "feline coronaviruses (FCoV) have been classified into two biotypes. the ubiquitous feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) and infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) the widely accepted theory in vitro is that FIPV arises by mutation of parental FECV in the gastrointestinal tract of infected cats. the capsid protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) possesses a cyclophilin A (CyPA) binding site for incorporation into the virion. a CsA-induced reduction in CyPA inhibits transport of the reverse-transcribed viral genome to the nucleus [14,15] cyclosporin A, cyclosporin H, and FK506 we inoculated fcwf-4 cells with FIPV 79\u20131146 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 plaque-forming unit (pfu) per cell. cells were adsorbed with FIPV, rinsed three times with PBS (), overlaid with DMEM containing 5 % fetal bovine serum and 2 % Agarose S (N the second PCR products were cut with Nco I and Eco RI. the second PCR products were subcloned into the sites between Nco I and Eco RI of the pTri-EX 1.1 vector (Novagen, Takara Bio, Kyoto, Japan) to express FLAG-tagged N protein. fcwf-4 cells were infected at an MOI of 1 pfu per cell. the viral RNA copy number was normalized using the feline -2-microglobulin (2M) gene. the 2M gene derived from fcwf-4 cells was cloned by PCR amplification. the two reporter plasmids were co-transfected into fcwf-4 cells with or without CsA or FK506 for each assay. total cell lysates were prepared with reporter Lysis buffer provided with the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System. we inoculated fcwf-4 cells with FIPV 79\u20131146 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 plaque-forming unit (pfu) per cell. the cells were rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline [PBS] and incubated with or without various concentrations. s of CsA (Sigma-Aldrich), cyclosporin H (CsH); cyclosporin H (CsH; Cosmobio, Tokyo, Japan) and FK506 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 20 h. cells were adsorbed with FIPV, rinsed three times with PBS. after a 20-h incubation, cells were stained with Giemsa solution. the fcwf-4 cells were infected at an MOI of 1 pfu per cell. the medium was removed at 22 h post-infection, and RNAiso-plus (Takara Bio) was added to the cells for RNA preparation according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. the amplified PCR products were subcloned into pTAC-1 plasmids. we then quantified the feline 2M gene by real-time PCR using the forward (5\u2019-CGCGTTTTTTGTGGTCTTTTGGT-3\u2019) and reverse (5\u2019-AAACCTGAGAGAATGC-3\u2019) primers. Luciferase activities were quantified in triplicate assays using a Lumat LB9507 (Berthold Technologies, Tokyo, Japan) cell membranes were disrupted with cell lysis buffer [10 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mM ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), 1 % NP-40, 0.15 M NaCl] cytopathic inhibitory effects did not significantly differ in the presence or absence of 0.08 - 10 M FK506. fcwf-4 cells infected with or without CsA were incubated with various concentrations of CsA. the numbers of plaque were counted in fcwf-4 cells infected with FIPV. RT-PCR showed 0.63 - 10 M CsA dose-dependently suppressed RNA replication, whereas FK506 did not exert significant inhibitory effects. the results show that no inhibition occurred (data not shown) CsA does not elicit either an interferon-stimulated response or a NF-AT response in fcwf-4 cells. the action of CsA on intracellular FIPV replication does not involve the activation of interferon-stimulated genes on fcwf-4 cells. cwf-4 cells were incubated with or without indicated concentrations of CsA or FK506. Neither CsA nor FK506 affected NF-AT luciferase activities in fcwf-4 cells. the inhibition of NF-AT replication by CsA is independent of the calcineurin NF-AT pathway. Cyclosporin A blocks both the enzymatic activities of CyP that lead to the calcineurin (CN)-NF-AT and the P-glycoprotein pathway. cytopathic inhibitory effects did not significantly differ in the presence or absence of 0.08 - 10 M FK506. Western blotting showed that CsA, but not FK506 dose-dependently decreased FIPV-N protein (Figure 3B) cells were infected with FIPV and incubated with or without the indicated concentrations of CsA or FK506. the results show that no inhibition occurred. the action of CsA and FK506 involves activation of interferon-stimulated gene responses in fcwf-4 cells. fcwf-4 cells are unresponsive, even to interferon. luciferase activity does not involve activation of interferon-stimulated genes. pGL3 plasmid for normalization and ISRE-luciferase plasmid were transfected into fcwf-4 cells which were then incubated with or without indicated concentrations of CsA and FK506. transfection efficiency was normalized by Renilla luciferase gene expression. NF-AT reporter assays indicate that neither CsA nor FK506 influenced NF-AT activities on fcwf-4 cells under our experimental conditions. the antiviral activity against FIPV is not involved in the suppression of gene responses regulated by NF-AT but is exerted through distinct mechanisms that are independent of FK506. formatics tools have found that the SARS coronavirus N protein binds to CyPA [26-28] therefore, the N protein of FIPV probably binds to CyP proteins to regulate viral replication. the proposed mechanisms of the inhibitory effect of CsA mainly involve CypA and CypB in virus replication and transcription. further studies are required to resolve which CyP is critical for viral replication. -in-aid for Scientific Research (C) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science and the Strategic Research Base Development Program for Private Universities."}
