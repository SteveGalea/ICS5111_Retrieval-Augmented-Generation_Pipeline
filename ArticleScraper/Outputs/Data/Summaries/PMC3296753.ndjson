{"summary": "SARS was first seen in the guangdong province of china in late 2002. spread rapidly to a further 30 countries with more than 8000 cases reported within a few months. virus is caused by a group of positive strand RNA viruses. mutagenesis protocol allows for mutagenesis of the cDNA by a process involving homologous recombination. the initial phase of SARS-CoV infection is characterised by the lack of an adequate antiviral cytokine response, which leads to an unusually high virus load. vaccinia virus-based reverse genetic system for SARS-CoV (isolate HKU-39849) and the characterization of recombinant SARS-CoV. in this paper, we describe the development of a vaccinia virus-based reverse genetic system for SARS-CoV (isolate HKU-39849) and the characterization of recombinant SARS-CoV. vaccinia virus vSARS-CoV-5prime-gpt was replaced by homologous recombination. homologous recombination was used to repair a non-silent nucleotide change. the deletion was not present in the plasmid DNA that had initially been sequenced. the cloned SARS-CoV sequence is based on SARS-CoV isolate HKU-39849. in total there are two silent and seven non-silent nucleotide differences. eight of these nine nucleotides in the HKU-UOB sequence match to those encoded by the SARS-CoV Frankfurt-1 isolate (GenBank: AY291315) [19] 304, 16325 and 16955, and one deliberately introduced silent nucleotide change (nt 20279) to create unique SfiI and BglI sites that are used for ligation of vSARS-CoV-5prime and vSARS-CoV-3prime DNA. so, the recombinant SARS-CoV cDNA had 12 nucleotide changes compared to the SARS-CoV Frankfurt-1 sequence (AY29131 nsp6 13494\u201313495 GU AG GU GU GUU (Val) or AGU (Ser) nsp12 16325 A A A G CCA (Pro) or CCG (Pro) nsp13 16955 U U U C UCU (Ser) or UCC (Ser) nsp13 18065 G A G AAG (Lys) or AAA (Lys) nsp14 18965 A U cDNA inserts cloned in vSARS-CoV-5prime and vSARS-CoV-3prime were ligated to create a genome-length SARS-CoV cDNA template for in vitro transcription. vaccinia virus DNA derived from vSARS-CoV-5prime DNA was cleaved with SfiI and the vSARS-CoV-3prime DNA was cleaved with Bgl vaccinia virus recombinant clones were ligated with each other and vaccinia virus DNA to produce two clones spanning nts 1\u201320288 and 20272\u201329727 of the SARS-CoV genome respectively. the first 2012 nts of the former vaccinia virus recombinant was derived from the SARS-CoV isolate Frankfurt-1 (shaded in dark grey) vaccinia virus mediated homologous vero-E6 cells were infected with passage 0 (P0) virus harvests. infection was readily detected with IF microscopy. titer of 2107 pfu/mL was one log lower than that of sARS-CoV. lanes 3, 5, 7 and 9 show corresponding control reactions without reverse transcriptase. the 2.5 kb PCR products derived from recSARS-CoV were digested into two expected fragments of similar size. the wildtype PCR product remains undigested. the sizes of the PCR products were determined by comparison to a 1 Kb Plus DNA ladder (Invitrogen) the vSARS-CoV-5prime and vSARS-CoV-3prime template DNAs were amplified. the RT-PCR reaction failed to produce an amplification product using RNA from mock-infected cells and PCR amplification alone failed to produce a product using the same RNA templates. the plaque phenotype of recSARS-CoV is different compared to SARS-CoV Frankfurt-1. kinetics of recSARS-CoV replication are similar to those of sARS-CoV Frankfurt-1. kinetics of recSARS-CoV replication are similar to those of sARS-CoV. recognizing the 3\u2032 end of all viral mRNAs was used to visualize viral RNA bands. cells were double-labeled for nonstructural protein 3 (in red) and nucleocapsid protein (in green) as described previously. infection of human dendritic cells with SARS-CoV has been shown to be abortive. recombinant HCoV-229E expressing a fusion protein and a melanoma CD8+ T cell epitope (Mel-A) which efficiently activated human Mel-A-specific CD8+ T cells. luciferase expressing viruses replicated similarly to their recombinant counterparts. the genome structure of recombinant SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E viruses expressing Renilla luciferase (HCoV-229E-luc and SARS-CoV-luc) is shown. grey boxes represent ORFs encoding virus replicase. HCoV-229E-luc-mediated Renilla luciferase expression in virus-infected cells was assessed at 12 hours (black bars) and 24 hours p.i. (white bars), the fold increase in Renilla luciferase expression levels represents the ratio of luciferase activity in virus-infected cells compared to that in mock-infected cells. homologous recombination was used to repair a non-silent nucleotide change. the deletion was not present in the plasmid DNA that had initially been sequenced. homologous recombination was also used to repair a nucleotide change. the cloned SARS-CoV sequence is based on the recombinant vaccinia viruses vSARS-CoV-5prime and vSARS-CoV-3prime. cloned in the recombinant vaccinia viruses vSARS-CoV-5prime and vSARS-CoV-3prime has only four nucleotide changes compared to the HKU-39849 genomic RNA isolated in the Bristol the recombinant SARS-CoV genome had 12 nucleotide changes compared to the SARS-CoV Frankfurt-1 sequence (AY291315). the cDNA had 13 nucleotide changes compared to the SARS-CoV HKU-39849 sequence (AY278491) reported by Zeng et al. [18]. nsp13 16955 U U U C UCU (Ser) or UCC (Ser) nsp13 18065 G A G G AAG (Lys) or AUU (Ile) nsp14 19084 U C C C AUA (Ile) or ACA (Thr) nsp14 20279b A A A C GGA (Gly) or GGC (Gly)b nsp15 24933 U C C vSARS-CoV-5prime and vSARS-CoV-3prime were ligated to create a genome-length SARS-CoV cDNA template for in vitro transcription. both DNAs were then cleaved to join the vSARS-CoV-5prime SfiI site with the vSARS-CoV-3prime BglI site. the resulting DNA ligation products were then cleaved with Ea the first 2012 nts of the former vaccinia virus recombinant was derived from the SARS-CoV isolate Frankfurt-1 (shaded in dark grey) vaccinia virus mediated homologous recombination was then used to reconstitute the SARS-CoV subgenomic fragments. this resulted in the clones vSARS-CoV-5prime and vSARS-CoV-3prime. RT-PCR analysis and plaque assay confirm recovery of recSARS-CoV. cells were fixed at 8 hours post infection (p.i.) and stained for nonstructural protein 3 (green) noclei were stained using Hoechst 33258 (blue) the 2.5 kb PCR products derived from recSARS-CoV (lanes 11 and 12) were digested into two expected fragments of similar size (1266 bp and 1285 bp) the wildtype PCR product remains undigested. supernatant contained recSARS-CoV RNA that could be cleaved by BglI. RT-PCR reaction failed to produce an amplification product using RNA from mock-infected cells and PCR amplification alone failed to produce a product using the same RNA templates. the plaque phenotype of recSARS-CoV and SARS-CoV HKU-39849 is different compared to SARS-CoV Frankfurt-1. the kinetics of recSARS-CoV replication are similar to those of SARS-CoV Frankfurt-1. the synthesis of viral proteins in recSARS-CoV infected cells parallels the kinetics of virus replication. cells were double-labeled for nonstructural protein 3 (in red) and nucleocapsid protein (in green) as described previously. infection of human dendritic cells Infection of hDCs with SARS-CoV has been shown to be abortive and replication is only barely detectable [13], [14], [22]. luciferase expressing viruses replicated similarly to their recombinant counterparts. recSARS-CoV-luc and HCoV-229E-luc were then used to investigate the replication of luciferase in hDCs. the regions of HCoV-229E ORF4a/b and SARS-CoV ORF7a are enlarged to illustrate the ORF encoding Renilla luciferase and surrounding nucleotides. nucleotides depict CoV nucleotides at the border to non-CoV sequences. luciferase expression was assessed at 12 hours (black bars) and 24 hours p.i. (white bars) the fold increase in Renilla luciferase expression levels in virus-infected cells represents the ratio of luciferase activity in virus-infected cells compared to that in mock-infected cells. we have shown that the process of vaccina virus mediated homologous recombination is not only a powerful tool to introduce mutations the reverse genetic system for SARS-CoV allows for the generation of recombinant viruses expressing reporter genes, such as the Renilla luciferase gene. the reverse genetic system for SARS-CoV allows for the generation of recombinant viruses expressing reporter genes, such as the Renilla luciferase gene. SARS-CoV is not able to mediate efficient heterologous gene expression in hDCs. this suggests that the abortive infection is terminated prior to the expression of detectable levels of viral gene products. this result confirms and extends the previous work of Law et al. and Spiegel et al.
