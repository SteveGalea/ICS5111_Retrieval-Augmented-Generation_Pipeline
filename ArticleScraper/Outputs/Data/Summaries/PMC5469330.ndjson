{"summary": "surfactin is a cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic and biosurfactant synthesized by Bacillus subtilis [5] it consists of an anionic seven-membered peptide cyclo and a mixture of several hydrophobic -hydroxy fatty acids with chain lengths of 13\u201315 carbon atoms. studies on surfactin are focused on properties against phytopathogenic microorganisms, such as antibacterial [7], antifungal [8], inhibition of fibre both the B. subtilis OKB105 and surfactin exhibit the suppressive activity against TGEV entry in the intestinal porcine epithelial cell line (IPEC-J2) cells. apoptosis of IPEC-J2 cells and toll-like receptors were also detected. the viable B. subtilis were resuspended in DMEM to the designed concentration from 1.00E + 07 to 1.00E + 10 colony forming units (cfu) per ml. the concentration of surfactin is over 95% detected by HPLC. monolayers of IPEC-J2 cells were treated with B. subtilis 168, OKB105 and surfactin for 1.5 h respectively. TGEV was added to the cell layer together with B. subtilis 168, OKB105 and surfactin respectively, during the 1.5 h infection period (co-treatment assay), virus was mixed with B. subtilis 168, OKB105 and surfactin respectively. aliquots were removed and diluted 1:10 with DMEM supplemente cells were incubated at 4\u00b0C for 30 min to solidify the medium. cells were then grown at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 to allow plaque formation. bacterial cells without virus served as control and ST cells without addition of TGEV served as mock. cells were treated with 1.00E + 07 cfu/ml B. subtilis or 0.002 mg/ml surfactin for 1.5 h. then the p-EGFR, APN and TLR-6 proteins were detected by Western blotting. qRT-PCR reactions were performed in a TRIzol reagent. -TLR6 (Bioss), followed by HRP\u2013conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and HRP\u2013conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) were used. the signal was detected using Super Signal West Pico lit (Thermo Scientific) and subjected to Image Reader LAS-4000 imaging system (FUJIFILM, Japan) surfactin inhibition of B. subtilis or surfactin B. subtilis 168 and OKB105 was cultivated in Luria broth (LB) then after centrifugation, the bacteria were washed three times to remove excess LB. the viable B. subtilis were resuspended in DMEM to the designed concentration from 1.00E + 07 to 1.00E + 10 colony forming units. cells were washed three times and kept in medium containing 1% penicillin/streptomycin for 0.5 h to kill any viable bacteria that were left. each experiment was performed in triplicate. two hundred fifty microlitres of filtrate were added to confluent monolayers of ST cells grown in six-well tissue culture plates. cells were incubated for 1.5 h at 37\u00b0C after exorcizing surfactin effect and probiotics as described above. the impact of B. subtilis or surfactin treatments on IPEC-J2 cells. a single-treatment assay was performed using a TRIzol reagent. qRT-PCR reactions were performed using a TRIzol reagent. Western blotting for immunodetection of the TGEV-N, p-EGFR, APN and TLR-6 proteins. rabbit anti-TGEV (VMRD, Hangzhou, China) followed by HRP\u2013conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and HRP\u2013conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) were used. B. subtilis or surfactin were added to confluent cells in a 96-well plate. cell viability was measured by MTT and normalized to the value of non-treated control cells. cell survival rates at different concentrations are given. cells were exposed to B. subtilis 168, OKB105 and surfactin in different treatments. the yield of virus was determined by qRT-PCR (A) and Western blotting (B) a cell-free assay was performed to survey the attachment of TGEV to the B. subtilis. a cell-free assay was performed to survey the attachment of TGEV to the B. subtilis. both the TGEV and B. subtilis 168 and OKB105 enhance the expression of APN protein and p-EGFR in IPEC-J2 cells. both the TGEV and B. subtilis 168 and OKB105 enhanced the EGFR activation and increased the expression of APN. TGEV could increase the apoptosis level of IPEC-J2 cells to some extent, while B. subtilis and surfactin could significantly reduce the apoptotic cells number (P0.01) the reduction extent of apoptpsis our \u2018drugs' caused was ease. B. subtilis or surfactin were added to confluent cells in a 96-well plate. cell viability was measured by MTT and normalized to the value of non-treated control cells. the cell survival rates at different concentrations are given. a hidden association between B. subtilis and IPEC-J2 cells. the surfactin might function on both the virus and the cells. the surfactin may show synergetic effect to some extent. a cell-free assay was performed to survey the attachment of TGEV to the B. subtilis. if mixed with TGEV at MOI 0.01, B. subtilis 168 could attach much more virus than OKB105. both the TGEV and B. subtilis 168 and OKB105 enhance the expression of both APN protein and p-EGFR in IPEC-J2 cells. both the TGEV and B. subtilis 168 and OKB105 enhanced the EGFR activation, and increased the expression of APN. the apoptosis of IPEC-J2 cells was assessed. TGEV could increase the apoptosis level of IPEC-J2 cells to some extent. the reduction extent of apoptpsis our \u2018drugs' caused was ease. rugs\u2019 could attach to the viral-entry receptors, we performed a single-treatment experiment. results showed that after stimulation with B. subtilis, both 168 and OKB105, the expression of both APN protein and p-EGFR were increased. however, the surfactin stimulus did not change the receptor expression. RT-PCR was employed to determine mean TLR-6/GAPDH ratio. TGEV could increase apoptosis level of IPEC-J2 cells to some extent, while B. subtilis and surfactin could significantly reduce the apoptotic cells number. previous studies have proven that EGFR is the receptor of TGEV. in order to interrupt TGEV infection, we detected the inhibition effect of B. subtilis OKB105 and the surfactin on TGEV entry process in vitro. the cells were challenged with TGEV at MOI 0.01, as this more closely reflects the natural infection. the lipid membrane of SHV-1 was disintegrated after incubation with surfactin at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. the lipid membrane of SHV-1 was disintegrated after incubation with surfactin at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. the expression of TLR-6 was not detected in our IPEC-J2 cells. TLR-6 was reported as a novel member of TLRs by Takeuchi et al. in 1999. it consisted of the signalling pathway of TLR2\u2013TLR6\u2013MyD88, MDA-5\u2013IPS-1 and NALP3 inflammasome pathways. apoptosis was an important regulatory mechanism in intestine maturation. authors declare that there are no competing interests associated with the manuscript. the authors declare that there are no competing interests associated with the manuscript."}
