{"summary": "researchers used two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis (2-DIGE), coupled with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS) to explore proteome profiles of trachea and kidney tissues from chicken at different stages infected in vivo with the highly virulent ck/CH/LDL/ infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) was the first coronavirus to be discovered. it is a major poultry pathogen and is probably endemic in all chicken-raising regions. it has dramatic effects on host cell morphology, transcription and translation patterns, the cell cycle, cytoskeleton, suppression of interferon and apoptosis pathways. RNA viruses such as influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) provide invaluable information on the cellular signaling pathways involved in either the cellular response to viral infections. the in vivo infection model could yield more biologically relevant insights into pathogenesis. chickens exhibited respiratory clinical signs at about 4-14 dpi with the IBV ck/CH/LDL/97I P5 strain. clinical signs included tracheal rales, watery eyes, nasal mucus, and sneezing. chickens in the control group showed a negative serum antibody response. 5-infected group, virus was detected from trachea and kidney at 4, 7, 14 and 21 dpi. peak of viral copy number was at 4 dpi, then fell until 14 dpi, and only a little fluctuated at 21 dpi. both in trachea and kidney, the P115-infected group had the lower viral genome copies than P5-infected group. dpi; 1293 91, 1365 126, and 1220 56 protein spots were detected in gels from the control group, and P115-infected group at 14 dpi. 1204 91, 1236 42, and 1111 50 protein spots were detected in gels from the control group, and P115-infected group at 21 dpi. gels were scanned on a Typhoon 9400 scanner, and image analysis was performed with EttanTM DeCyder Software version v6.5. the protein spots identified were marked with circles and labeled with the respective Match ID listed in Tables 3 and 4. In the tracheal total proteome at 4 dpi, both viruses produce a broadly similar response. protein score CI%c Mw (Da) pI Average ratio and p-value P5-infected/control P115-infected/control P115-infected/control 4 dpi 7 dpi 14 dpi 4 dpi 7 dpi 14 dpi 14 dpi 21 dpi ratio p ratio p ratio p ratio p ratio p ratio p ratio p ratio p ratio p gi|18470900 331 100 28600 5.2 0.57 0.001 0.97 0.695 2021 Vimentin (VIM) gi|212868 1160 100 53166.6 5.09 0.76 0.015 0.56 0.001 is the MASCOT result of MALDI-TOF/TOF searched from the NCBInr database. annexin A2 (ANXA2) gi|45382533 783 100 38901 6.92 1.54 0.371 N/A 0 2.44 0.012 4.63 0.003 2224 cartilage matrix protein precursor gi|71896317 1090 100 54798.1 6.63 12.82 0.019 2.59 0 1689 creatine kinase M-type gi|211528 443 100 43529.1 6.5 0.87 0.567 0.488 0.44 0.071 0.5 0.012 2.55 0.004 2.81 0.024 1.28 0.088 4635 selenium binding protein 1 gi|118102241 731 100 53097.6 6.17 0.82 0.156 1.86 0.034 2016 succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid-coenzyme A transferase 1, mitochondrial gi|60592998 201 100 56549.4 8.01 5.49 0.138 pi 21 dpi ratio p ratio p ratio p ratio p ratio p ratio p ratio p ratio p ratio p ratio p ratio p ratio p ratio p ratio p 2033 carbonyl reductase [NADPH] 1 gi|71895267 1110 100 30519.9 8.5 1.66 0.005 435 catalase gi|53127216 529 100 60279 8.09 0.64 0.002 0. 0 417 similar to CDNA sequence BC048391 gi|118098312 734 100 65576.4 7.85 0.52 0.008 0.81 0.13 422 similar to CDNA sequence BC048391 gi|118098312 865 100 65576.4 7.85 1.35 0.033 1.52 0.021 436 similar to cystathionase gi|118094764 618 100 44554.7 6.86 0.78 0.032 0.66 0.001 21 protein score confidence interval (C.I. %) for PMF and MS/MS data 95% Table 4.

ANXA2 is involved in various intra- and extracellular processes including signal transduction, anti-inflammatory processes, membrane trafficking, and ion channel activity. at 7 dpi with the highly virulent P5 strain of IBV was greater than that induced by the attenuated P115 strain. western blot analysis found that the abundance of the anti-oxidative protein MnSOD was significantly higher in highly virulent IBV ck/CH/LDL/97I strain infected group. HSPB1 has different cytoprotective roles, including acting as a molecular chaperone. it is involved in all phases of the viral life cycle, including cell entry, virion disassembly, viral genome transcription, replication and morphogenesis. abundance of HSPB1 was observed to be increased in IBV-infected Vero cells using stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture. tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, pentose phosphate pathway, and macromolecular biosynthesis. the rate of glycolysis in cells infected by poliomyelitis virus was increased by as much as 370%. some proteins involved in glycolysis, such as aldose reductase, pyruvate kinase, alpha-enolase, and triosephosphate isomerase, were found increased significantly in the early stage of we investigated the proteome profiles of tracheal and kidney tissues from chicken infected with highly virulent IBV ck/CH/LDL/97I P5 and embryo-passaged, attenuated IBV strain ck/CH/LDL/97I P115. some proteins involved in cytoskeleton organization, stress response, and anti-oxidative stress showed different change in abundance with IBV strains differing in virulence. experimental design Sixty-six one-day-old SPF White Leghorn chickens were divided randomly into three groups. chickens were inoculated with the IBV ck/CH/LDL/97I P5 strain and ck/CH/LDL/97I P115 strain. chickens were mock-inoculated in parallel with sterile allantoic fluid. RNA was extracted from 200 l tissue supernatant using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) following manufacturer's instructions. one-step real-time RT-PCR reactions were performed using one step PrimeScript\u00ae RT-PCR kit. 100 mg tissue powder was dissolved in 500 l lysing solution containing 7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 40 mM DTT, 2% IPG buffer pH 3-10, 1% nuclease mix and 1% Protease Inhibitor Mix. the supernatant was collected and purified with the PlusOne 2D Quant Kit (GE Healthcare) three independent gels from the P5-infected and P115-infected groups were compared with those from the corresponding control group at 4, 7, 14 and 21 dpi respectively. the normalized volume values (vol %) of matched protein spots were subjected to Student's t test using the SPSS statistical software package version 16.0. Isoelectric focusing (IEF) was performed on an EttanTM IPGphor 3 (GE Healthcare) using the following protocol: 30 V for 12 h, 200 V for 2 h, 500 V for 2 h, 1000 V for 2 h, 8000 V for 3 h, and 65000 Vh. the second dimension separation was conducted on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels using an EttanTM DALT six system (GE Healthcare) gel samples were washed twice with 50 mM w/v NH4HCO3 and covered with 10 mg/ml Porcine Trypsin solution. the supernatant was removed into a second tube and 40 l 50 mM w/v NH4HCO3 was added. the gel was washed with 70% v/v ACN and dried in a Speed Vac (Vacuum Concentrator, Bachhofer) the peptide mass fingerprint (PMF) combined MS/MS data were submitted to MASCOT version 3.0 (Matrix Science) for identification according to the NCBInr database (release 16/01/2010, 10343571 sequences, 3528215794 residues) the search parameters were set as follows: Gallus, trypsin cleavage, carbamidomethylation of cysteine as fixed modification, oxidation of methionine as variable modification. each sample was amplified in triplicate using the 2-Ct method. samples from the control group at 4 dpi were used as the calibrator. samples from the control group at 4 dpi were used as the calibrator. experimental animals and infecting virus strains One-day-old white leghorn specific-pathogen-free chickens were obtained from the laboratory animal center. the chickens were maintained in isolators with negative pressure, and food and water were provided ad libitum. blood samples from 10 chickens in each group were collected at 4, 7, 14 and 21 days post inoculation. three chickens were selected randomly from each group and killed humanely at 4, 7, 14 and 21 days post inoculation.
