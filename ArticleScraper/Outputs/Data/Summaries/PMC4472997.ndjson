{"summary": "eukaryotic nucleus is separated from the cytoplasm by a double membrane called nuclear envelope (NE) cargoes >9 nm in diameter (60 kDa) are actively transported through NPCs by kariophilic transporters (Kaps) in a signal-mediated process. such signals can be either nuclear localization or nuclear export sequences (NLS and NESs) hepatitis C virus is a cytoplasmic-replicating RNA virus belonging to the Flaviviridae family. hepatitis C virus is a cytoplasmic-replicating RNA virus. hepatitis C virus is a cytoplasmic-replicating RNA virus. p7 and NS2 constitute the viral particle, while NS3 to NS5B proteins are sufficient for RNA replication. expression of the HCV polyprotein induces profound membrane rearrangements. such membrane alterations are common amongst positive-stranded RNA viruses. VFs also provide lipids essential for replication. Activated PI4KIII causes a profound redistribution of phosphatidylinositol-4 phosphate from the plasma membrane to VFs. newly synthesized viral genomes are delivered by NS5A on the surface of core-decorated LDs to be packaged in nucleocapsids, before being secreted through the very low density lipoprotein pathway. NS5A is a multifunctional phosphoprotein directly involved in multiple stages of viral life cycle, including VFs biogenesis, viral RNA replication and particle assembly. NS5A has been proposed to act as a master regulator of HCV life cycle, controlling the switch between viral replication and particle assembly. full-length NS5A is tethered to the ER by its N-terminal amphipathic -helix (AH), which prevents nuclear translocation. NS5A contains two caspase cleavage sites at residue position 154 and 389 (Figure 1). in HCV-infected cells, basal caspase activity generates low levels of NS5A truncated forms. overexpression of NS5A N-terminally truncated forms impairs HCV replication. c-Raf facilitates viral replication through attenuation of the IFN pathway. this mechanism reduces its own replication in case of virus-induced cellular stress. core protein is cleaved from the nascent polyprotein by the host cell signal peptidase. this facilitates translocation of the polyprotein into the ER lumen. core protein has been detected in the nucleus of hepatocytes of hepatocytes. core can be degraded in the nucleus in an ubiquitin-independent manner, and in the cytosol through an ubiquitin-independent process involving the E3 ubiquitin ligase E6AP. core is endowed with transcriptional activity, and represents the only HCV protein globally regulating host cell transcription. core is endowed with transcriptional activity, and represents the only HCV protein globally regulating host cell transcription, by directly binding the TATA-binding protein core can recruit the histone acetyltransferase p300 at the promoter. core also inhibits transcription of genes linked to apoptosis. NS5A also promotes immune evasion, while core specifically increases the translation rate of infected cells. these findings suggest that functional NPC-like structures could be recruited by HCV within the cytoplasmic VFs to build up a permeability barrier that improves the viral fitness. IPOA5 and IPO5 partially relocalized to VFs upon HCV infection. several HCV proteins have functional NLSs capable of interacting with different Kaps. addition of cell permeable HCV NLS-mimicking peptides differently affected the outcome of viral infection. IPO5-binding ones interfered with both viral replication and assembly. NS5A interaction with IPO5 would suggest that NPC-like structures play a role in triggering the switch between viral replication and assembly by restricting NS5A from entering the VFs. the striking news about HCV life cycle is that Nups do work outside the physiological environment of the NE during viral infection. these findings are consistent with the functionality of numerous NLSs on HCV proteins. core and NS5A and/or their variants regulate the cellular transcriptional environment, making it conductive to cell survival and prone to persistent viral infection by promoting ribosome biogenesis."}
