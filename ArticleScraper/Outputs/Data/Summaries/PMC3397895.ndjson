{"summary": "hRSV is an enveloped pneumovirus in the paramyxoviridae family. up to 64 million reported cases of hRSV infection and 160,000 deaths occur each year. hRSV can cause repeated reinfections throughout life. the synthetic TM domain (residues 18\u201343) shows channel activity in synthetic bilayers (18) and forms homopentamers in perfluorooctanoic acid (PFO) gel electrophoresis. in this work, full-length SH protein was obtained using maltose-binding protein (MBP-SH) as an N-terminal fusion protein, which in turn has an N-terminal His tag. SH protein was characterized by ATR-FTIR when reconstituted into model lipid bilayers and in parallel by solution NMR after isotopic labeling, using detergent micelles. the latter technique allowed reconstruction of the pentameric -helical bundle that includes the extramembrane regions. cells were harvested when A600 0.6\u20130.7 was reached by centrifugation. cells were transferred to M9 minimal media containing [15N]ammonium chloride or [13C]glucose. cells were harvested and resuspended in Ni2+-NTA binding buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with elution buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, 500 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, and 30 mm octyl--d-glucopyranoside. expression and purification of TEV Protease Expression and purification of TEV protease were done in similar way for SH protein. the supernatant was extracted by methanol by adding 10 ml of methanol per 1 liter of culture and mixing gently for 2 h at room temperature. the supernatant was injected onto a Zorbax C3\u2013300 column connected to an HPLC system. electrophoreses were run at constant voltage of 80 V for 3 h at room temperature. gels were stained with Coomassie Blue dye. arrow shows band corresponding to the fusion protein migrating at 50 kDa. all experiments were performed in a Beckman XL-1 analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter) using a six-channel carbon-epoxy composite centerpiece equipped with quartz windows for absorbance experiments. the software program Winmatch was used to monitor whether the equilibrium had been reached at each speed, every 3\u20134 h. extinction coefficient at 280 nm and partial specific volumes for each sample were calculated using the program SEDNTERP. FTIR spectra were recorded on a Nicolet Nexus 560 spectrometer (Madison, WI) purged with N2 and equipped with an MCT/A detector cooled with liquid nitrogen. the area of amide I (C=O stretching) was obtained by peak integration from 1600 to 1700 cm1. the area of amide II (N\u2013H bending, centered at 1550 cm1) was obtained by peak integration from 1510 to 1580 cm1. 124.0 NaCl, 3.5 KCl, 0.01 NaH2PO4, 26.2 NaHCO3, 1.3 MgSO4, 2.5 CaCl2, and 10.0 d(+)-glucose. the internal solution contained the following (mm): 135.0 potassium gluconate, 10.0 KCl, 10.0 HEPES buffer, 0.5 EGTA, 2.0 Mg-ATP. the voltages were uncorrected for a 9 mV junction potential stI-digested pIRES-AcGFP1 vector transfected into HEK 293 cells. cells were seeded on the 10-mm Petri dishes containing poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips. a total of 4 g of pIRES-AcGFP plasmids were transfected using lipofectamine 2000 kit. dry 5-doxyl stearic acid (5-DSA) or 16-doxyl stearic acid (16-DSA) was first dissolved separately in 300 l of methanol. 30 l of methanol solubilized DSA was then aliquoted into an Eppendorf tube. the probes were then dried under a stream of dry N2 gas and placed in a vacuum lyophilizer for at least 2 h. the tube was placed in a vacuum lyophilizer for at least 2 h to remove any residual methanol. the thin protein film was then solubilized with sample buffer containing 5 mg of d38 DPC (Avanti Polar Lipids) and 100 mm acetate buffer. the sample pH was brought up to 4.4 by titrating with aqueous sodium hydroxide. ed NOESY-HSQC (200 ms mixing time), three-dimensional 15N-resolved TOCSY-HSQC (45 and 75 ms mixing time), and three-dimensional 13C-resolved NOESY-HSQC (200 ms mixing time). to identify transmembrane residues, the NMR sample was lyophilized overnight and reconstituted in 99% D2O. Sodium 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapent 100 conformers were calculated, and the structure with the lowest energy function was selected as the representative model for construction of the C5-symmetrical SH pentamers. the docking was performed from five copies of the representative model (from CNS with the lowest energy function) and inclusion of RDCs for all five monomers. cloning of SH gene The nucleotide sequence of SH protein was obtained from NCBI (NC_001803.1), strain S2 ts1C. the SH gene was synthesized with MBP as fusion partner carrying a His tag at the N terminus to produce the construct His-MBP-SH. cells were incubated with 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme and 0.02 mg/ml benzonase. octyl--d-glucopyranoside was added to the sample to a final concentration of 50 mm. the proteins were allowed to bind to the nickel resin with gentle shaking at 4 \u00b0C overnight. expression and purification of TEV Protease Expression and purification of TEV protease were done in a similar way for SH protein. no octyl--d-glucopyranoside was added to the sample. purified SH protein was eluted with a linear gradient of solvent A (water/TFA, 99.9:0.1, v/v) and solvent D (isopropyl alcohol/acetonitrile/TFA, 80:19.9:0.1, v/v) pooled fractions were lyophilized, and the purity of the samples was checked by MALDI. the arrowhead at 0 h shows the band corresponding to the fusion construct His-MBP-SH. the arrowhead at 4 h shows the band corresponding to cleaved SH protein. the position of the cleaved His-MBP fragment and the TEV protease are also shown in the 4-h experiment. the software program Winmatch was used to monitor whether the equilibrium had been reached at each speed, every 3\u20134 h. for DPC or C8E5, the detergent concentration was 15 and 33 mm, respectively. infrared Spectroscopy FTIR spectra were recorded on a Nicolet Nexus 560 spectrometer (Madison, WI) purged with N2 and equipped with an MCT/A detector cooled with liquid nitrogen. attenuated total reflection (ATR) spectra were measured with a 25-reflection ATR accessory from Graseby Specac (Kent, UK) and a wire grid polarizer (0.25 micro the kinetics of exchange was calculated by measuring the relative area of amide II relative to the amide I band (26). expression of wild type and mutants of the full-length SH gene was confirmed using green fluorescent protein (GFP) (27). the full-length SH gene was cloned into the pIRES-AcGFP1 (Aequorea coerulescens green fluorescent protein) vector (Clontech), containing a green fluorescent protein gene. the voltages were uncorrected for a 9 mV junction potential. whole-cell currents were filtered at 1\u20135 kHz and sampled at 5\u201350 kHz. the access resistance Ra (usually less than 20 MegaOhms) and the capacitive transients were not compensated. pIRES-AcGFP plasmids were transfected into HEK 293 cells using lipofectamine 2000 kit (Invitrogen) the cells were incubated with a laser scanning confocal microscope overnight at 4 \u00b0C. the sample containing SH/DPC was added to the tube containing dried DSA and vortexed until the film dissolved completely. the sample was left to equilibrate for at least 2 h before NMR measurements were taken. the sample pH was brought up to 4.4 by titrating with aqueous sodium hydroxide. the sample was spun at 13,000 rpm to clear nonreconstituted protein. the sample was lyophilized overnight and reconstituted in 99% D2O. entane-5-sulfonate was used as the internal reference for 1H nuclei. the chemical shifts of 13C and 15N nuclei were calculated from the 1H chemical shifts (29) analysis of the RDC data was done using the program MODULE (30) pentameric model of SH-TM in lipid bilayers obtained previously using site-specific infrared dichroism was used to derive a set of plausible intermonomeric NOEs. these were verified against experimental side-chain NOEs from standalone peaks in 13C HSQC and 13C-resolved NOESY-HSQC spectra. the lumen dimensions for the pentameric model were calculated using HOLE (38). cells from a single colony were picked to inoculate 10 ml of LB media with 100 g/ml ampicillin and 34 g/ml chloramphenicol. 8 ml of the overnight culture was then transferred to 800 ml of LB media and grown at 37 \u00b0C with shaking. cells were induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl -thiogalactoside and grown overnight at 23 \u00b0C with shaking. octyl-d-glucopyranoside was added to the sample to a final concentration of 50 mm. the cells were lysed with a microfluidizer at 15,000 p.s.i. pressure. the supernatant was collected after centrifugation at 20,000 g for 30 min. the proteins were allowed to bind to the nickel resin with gentle shaking at 4 \u00b0C overnight. trichloroacetic acid (TCA) was added to the His-MBP-SH construct at a mass ratio of 1:5 (TEV/fusion protein, mg/ml) the reaction was performed at room temperature with gentle shaking, and the progress of the reaction was monitored. esis Reduced SDS-PAGE or PFO-PAGE using precast Tricine gradient gel (Bio-Rad) was used to test the purity of the preparations. the gel used in Fig. 1C was an in-house 12.5% gel that was run using Tris-glycine buffer, pH 9. the arrowhead at 4 h shows the band corresponding to cleaved SH protein. the position of the cleaved His-MBP fragment (labeled MBP) and the TEV protease are also shown in the 4-h experiment. methanol was dried under a stream of nitrogen gas and lyophilized for at least 3 h. 5 mm C14 betaine in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 29.4% D2O, pH 7.3, was added to the dried protein samples and mixed by 5 min of vortexing. the sample was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 5 min before loading into the six-channel centerpiece. attenuated total reflection (ATR) spectra were measured with a 25-reflection ATR accessory from Graseby Specac (Kent, UK) and a wire grid polarizer (0.25 micrometers, Graseby Specac) 100 l of sample in water with 50:1 lipid/peptide molar ratio were applied onto a trapezoidal (50 2 20 mm) germanium internal reflection element. the full-length SH gene was cloned into the pIRES-AcGFP1 (Aequorea coerulescens green fluorescent protein) vector (Clontech) by using restriction enzymes BgIII and PstI. the internal ribosome entry site of the encephalomyocarditis virus permits the translation of two open reading frames from one messenger RNA. onpatch Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Axon Instruments) were filtered at 1\u20135 kHz and sampled at 5\u201350 kHz. the access resistance Ra (usually less than 20 MegaOhms) and the capacitive transients were not compensated. the plasmid containing SH-FLAG was generated by cloning a pIRES-AcGFP1 vector into the HEK 293 cells. the fixed cells were washed twice with PBS before blocking by 0.3% BSA/PBS with or without 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min. the HEK 293 cells were visualized using a laser scanning confocal microscope. the best results were obtained in d38 DPC. gels were prepared from stock containing 36% w/v acrylamide (Bio-Rad) and 0.94 w/v N,N-methylenebisacrylamide (Bio-Rad) gels were washed in large excess of H2O overnight to ensure removal of unreacted components. gels were then dried to completeness at 37 \u00b0C. the sample was lyophilized overnight and reconstituted in 99% D2O. for copper addition, the SH protein was reconstituted in 100 mm acetate buffer at pH 4.5 and 160 mm DPC, to a final protein/detergent molar ratio of 1:200. structure was calculated using the assignment of 1H, 13C, and 15N resonances. backbone dihedral angles were predicted using chemical shift data and PREDITOR. structure calculations were started from 100 random conformers. pentameric model of SH-TM in lipid bilayers obtained previously using site-specific infrared dichroism was used to derive a set of plausible intermonomeric NOEs. these were verified against experimental side-chain NOEs from standalone peaks in 13C HSQC and 13C-resolved NOESY-HSQC spectra. these inter-monomeric NOEs were implemented as the enforced restraints for the HADDOCK procedure a single colony were picked to inoculate 10 ml of LB media with 100 g/ml ampicillin and 34 g/ml chloramphenicol and grown overnight at 37 \u00b0C with shaking. 8 ml of the overnight culture was then transferred to 800 ml of LB media and grown at 37 \u00b0C with shaking. cells were harvested when A600 0.6\u20130.7 was reached by centrifugation and washed with M9 minimal media once. elution buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, 500 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, and 30 mm octyl--d-glucopyranoside was added to the his-MBP-SH

was collected by centrifugation at 18,000 g for 30 min. the pellet was washed twice with water followed by lyophilization. cleaved SH protein was separated from the His-MBP fragment. the nuPAGE\u00ae SDS-PAGE was prepared with BisTris buffer at near neutral pH and run using MES running buffer, pH 7.0, to minimize protein modification at extreme pH. electrophoreses were run at constant voltage of 80 V for 3 h at room temperature, and gels were stained with Coomassie Blue dye. wild type (WT) protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (A), PFO-PAGE (B), and BN-PAGE (in C14 betaine) (C) all experiments were performed at 25 \u00b0C on samples at three different initial SH protein concentrations (0.3, 0.5, and 0.8 absorbance at 280 nm) 110 l of sample and 120 l of reference buffer were loaded into the six-channel centerpiece. data obtained by UV absorption at 280 nm were analyzed using the program SEDNTERP. the monomeric mass, extinction coefficient at 280 nm, and partial specific volumes for each sample were calculated using the program. a total of 200 interferograms were collected at a resolution of 4 cm1. the area of amide I (C=O stretching) was obtained by peak integration from 1600 to 1700 cm1 and the area of amide II (N\u2013H bending, centered at 1550 cm1) was obtained by peak integration from 1510 to 1580 cm1. the cDNA was transfected into HEK 293 cells using the standard calcium phosphate method (28) the vector alone, pIRES-AcGFP1, was also transfected as a control. whole-cell current was recorded at room temperature using the standard patch clamp technique 48\u201372 h after transfection. plasmid containing SH-FLAG was generated by cloning a BglII/PstI-digested PCR product into the BglII/PstI-digested pIRES-AcGFP1 vector. cells were seeded on 10-mm Petri dishes containing poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips and grown overnight. the immunolabeled cells were visualized using a laser scanning confocal microscope (Fluoview BX61; Olympus) the best results were obtained in d38 DPC. an 8% polyacrylamide gel was cast using a gel chamber of 5.4 mm inner diameter (New Era Enterprise, Inc.) after polymerization was complete, gels were washed in large excess of H2O overnight to ensure removal of unreacted components. the gels were then dried to completeness at 37 \u00b0C. NMR experiments were performed at 37 \u00b0C (310 K) using Bruker Avance-II 700 and 600 NMR spectrometers equipped with cryogenic TXI probes. complete sequence-specific assignment of backbone was achieved using standard triple resonance experiments. side-chain resonances were assigned using three-dimensional 15N-resolved NOESY-HSQC (200 ms mixing time), three-dimensional 15N-resolved TOCSY-HSQC (45 and the final CYANA cycle showed a high density of structural constraints per amino acid. the program CNS 1.2 (35) was used to refine the SH structure by incorporating RDCs, dihedral angles, hydrogen bonds, and upper limit distance constraints (from CYANA) the lumen dimensions for the pentameric model were calculated using HOLE (38) and visualized using Visual Molecular Dynamics (39). RESULTS Overexpression and Purification of SH Protein from E. coli We expressed SH protein with its N terminus fused to His6-MBP (41), reaching moderate levels of expression after isopropyl -thiogalactoside induction. RP-HPLC purification shows a major peak corresponding to pure SH protein. this purified polypeptide showed channel activity when reconstituted in black lipid membranes. the synthetic peptide corresponding to the predicted TM domain of SH protein (residues 18\u201343) formed monomers in SDS but pentamers in the mild detergent PFO (18) analysis with SH protein previously solubilized in zwitterionic 3-(N,N-dimethylmyristylammonio)propanesulfonate (C14 betaine) micelles. we included as an additional molecular weight marker a membrane protein, E. coli aquaporin Z (monomeric size 27 kDa) data for WT SH was globally best-fitted to a monomer-pentamer equilibrium model. lower panels represent fit residuals. lower panels represent fit residuals. infrared amide I region of full-length SH protein and synthetic peptides SH-TM (18\u201343), corresponding to the TM domain, and SH(45\u201364), corresponding to the last 20 C-terminal residues, when incorporated in DMPC bilayers. amide I band in the infrared spectrum is contributed mainly by peptide backbone C=O stretching vibrations. the original spectrum (continuous line) and Fourier self-deconvolved (broken line) are shown; D\u2013F, amide II region corresponding to peptides in A\u2013C, before (solid line) and after (dot-dashed) H/D exchange. the standard deviation is result of three independent experiments. the spectrum for SH(45\u201364) shows >60% -structure and little or no -helix. amide II band was used to monitor protein H/D exchange. the frequency of amide II downshifts from near 1545 to 1450 cm1 (100 cm1) (47) SH protein in DPC Micelles NMR spectra were recorded in DPC micelles. it was found that SH forms stable pentamers in this detergent. but for extramembrane residues 5\u201314, 57, and 59\u201364, two or more closely spaced cross-peaks were observed. for NMR analysis, only the major component of each cross-peak was used. HNOEs provide information regarding backbone molecular motions in the picosecond-nanosecond time scale. the structure of the SH protein monomer was calculated using the constraints derived from 1508 NOEs. intermoleculara 15 Hydrogen bondsb 228 Total dihedral angle restraintsb 63 63 Total residual dipolar couplings 53 Excluding flexible regions 42 Structure statisticsc Violations (mean S.D.)

SH protein was reconstituted in E. coli liposomes or a mixture involving 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-l-serine] and cholesterol. assay used to test proton channel activity in influenza A M2 (53) purified polypeptide showed channel activity when reconstituted in black lipid membranes. the synthetic peptide corresponding to the predicted TM domain of SH protein (residues 18\u201343) formed monomers in SDS but pentamers in the mild detergent PFO (18) this is confirmed when examining the full-length SH protein (7.5 kDa) in the presence of SDS. water-soluble molecular weight markers may show abnormal mobility compared with membrane proteins in BN-PAGE (42) we included as an additional molecular weight marker a membrane protein, E. coli aquaporin Z (monomeric size 27 kDa), which forms a ladder with oligomers of increasing size in these conditions. data for WT SH collected at three protein concentrations (80, 50, and 30 m) and at three different speed as follows: 16,000 (blue), 19,500 (green), and 24,000 (red) rpm, in A\u2013C. lower panels represent fit residuals. structure predictions indicate that the -helical region of SH protein spans residues 16\u201346, i.e. 40% of the molecule (45), whereas the TM domain is predicted to encompass residues 20\u201340 (46). the amide I band in the infrared spectrum is contributed mainly by peptide backbone C=O stretching vibrations, which are sensitive to hydrogen bonding strength. analysis of the amide I region in SH and SH-TM Assignment, wave number (v) and relative areas of the component bands in the amide I region of SH protein and SH-TM were reconstituted in DMPC bilayers. for the SH-C20 peptide, it was estimated that the -structure constituted at least >60% of the peptide. the spectrum for SH(45\u201364) shows >60% -structure and little or no -helix. amide II band was used to monitor protein H/D exchange. the frequency of amide II downshifts from near 1545 to 1450 cm1 (100 cm1) (47) a comparison of the 1H-15N-TROSY-HSQC spectra in water and in 99% D2O (Fig. 5, A and B, respectively) shows that amide protons in 19 residues are significantly protected from exchange with water. this number is lower than the 30 residues determined for the full-length SH protein in lipid bilayers by FTIR. the dynamic properties of SH were studied using a 1H,15N steady-state HNOE experiment. the structure of the SH protein monomer was calculated using the constraints derived from 1508 NOEs and 126 dihedral angle constraints. restraintsb 63 63 Total residual dipolar couplings 53 Excluding flexible regions 42 Structure statisticsc Violations (mean S.D.)

HEK 293 cells were transfected with pIRES-AcGFP1 vector alone (A\u2013C), a vector containing SHwt-FLAG (D\u2013F), or the double mutant SHFF-FLAG (G\u2013I) cells were fixed, and AcGFP (green, 1st column) was visualized to determine SH expression. mutant H22A produced a distinct pattern with larger molecular weights compared with WT and H51A. double mutant AA had a tendency to aggregate before entering the gel. similar conclusions can be drawn from BN-PAGE experiments. mutants AA and FF cannot be activated because they both lack His side chains. lack of channel activity correlates with predicted functional features of SH. Cu2+ can inhibit channel activity by chelation to the histidine imidazole groups (52). to test if a similar effect could be observed in the SH protein, the bath solution was perfused with external buffer containing increasing concentrations of copper chloride, from 1 nm to 1 mm. however, this inhibitory effect was also observed when using mutant H22A, which indicates that His51 is also involved in this regulation. -oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-l-serine] and cholesterol. assay used to test proton channel activity in influenza A M2 (53) purified polypeptide showed channel activity when reconstituted in black lipid membranes. the synthetic peptide corresponding to the predicted TM domain of SH protein (residues 18\u201343) formed monomers in SDS but pentamers in the mild detergent PFO (18) this is confirmed when examining the full-length SH protein (7.5 kDa) in the presence of SDS (Fig. 2A, WT), mobility was consistent with a higher molecular weight (35 a membrane protein, E. coli aquaporin Z (monomeric size 27 kDa), forms a ladder with oligomers of increasing size in these conditions. the protein migrated as a single band with a mobility between monomeric and dimeric aquaporin Z (i.e. between 30 and 60 kDa). data for WT was globally best-fitted to a monomer-pentamer equilibrium model. lower panels represent fit residuals. lower panels represent fit residuals. infrared amide I region of full-length SH protein and synthetic peptides SH-TM (18\u201343), corresponding to the TM domain, and SH(45\u201364), corresponding to the last 20 C-terminal residues, when incorporated in DMPC bilayers. the amide I band in the infrared spectrum is contributed mainly by peptide backbone C=O stretching vibrations. analysis of the amide I region in SH and SH-TM Assignment, wave number (v) and relative areas of the component bands in the amide I region of SH protein and SH-TM were reconstituted in DMPC bilayers. the standard deviation is a result of three independent experiments. the spectrum for SH(45\u201364) shows >60% -structure and little or no -helix. amide II band was used to monitor protein H/D exchange. frequency of amide II downshifts from near 1545 to 1450 cm1 (100 cm1). a comparison of the 1H-15N-TROSY-HSQC spectra in water and in 99% D2O shows that amide protons in 19 residues are significantly protected from exchange with water. this number is lower than the 30 residues determined for the full-length SH protein in lipid bilayers by FTIR. the dynamic properties of SH were studied using a 1H,15N steady-state HNOE experiment (Fig. 5C), obtained for the backbone 1H-15N moieties. the structure of the SH protein monomer was calculated using the constraints derived from 1508 NOEs. statisticsc Violations (mean S.D.)

BN-PAGE analysis of SH WT and double mutant H22F/H51F. mutant FF produced a single band after solubilization in a variety of detergents. arrows indicate the position of the main band observed in each case for mutant FF. similar conclusions can be drawn from BN-PAGE experiments. a sample was presolubilized in C14 betaine, DPC, or C8E5. both H22A and AA produced smeared large aggregates compared with WT and H51A. mutants AA and FF cannot be activated because they both lack His side chains. lack of channel activity correlates with predicted functional features of SH. lack of channel activity correlates with predicted functional features of SH. a concentration of 1 m Cu2+ successfully inhibited the current evoked through SH protein by a factor of 2 (0.53 0.06) but this inhibitory effect was also observed when using mutant H22A, which indicates that His51 is also involved in this regulation. this suggests that His51 from different monomers may be in contact in biological membranes. used to test proton channel activity in influenza A M2 (53) in any of the protein/lipid ratios tested. the source of protein, i.e. synthetic or recombinant, may strongly affect the final outcome. in this study, we have used recombinant SH protein, where the extra amino acids are only three, N-terminally located to minimize any possible disruptive effect. a central pore of 19\u201326 is not compatible with the cation-selective ion channel activity observed by patch clamp. a ring formed by the N-terminal helices connected via a flexible linker to the TM domain would be compatible with the dimensions reported by electron microscopy. the N-terminal region corresponds to the ring of tightly packed short N-terminal helices, a feature reminiscent of the C-terminal extramembrane helix found in influenza A M2 (fragment 18\u201360). the heterocycle ring of Trp15 can be aligned along or orthogonal to the membrane surface. SH protein transiently expressed in mammalian cells produced nonselective cation channel activity, with passage of Na+ or K+. in vitro studies show that SH protein is not essential, although it is important for effective viral infection in vivo, an importance also suggested by its strong sequence conservation. the viroporins of Sindbis virus 6K, murine hepatitis virus E protein, influenza A M2 protein, and poliovirus 2b and 3A protein have all been reported to affect apoptosis in infected cells. however, inhibition of apoptosis during infection may give an advantage to the virus to replicate. these data argue against a mechanism mediated by a specific protein-protein interaction with an unknown protein. hRSV-infected cells should gain insight into the significance of SH viroporin activity in the hRSV life cycle. a microscopy study on full-length SH protein in liposomes or DHPC detergent micelles (17), very large (9 nm) structures were interpreted as pentameric or hexameric forms, with a central pore diameter of 19 and 26 respectively. the authors proposed a hexameric model, and not a pentameric one, although a rationale for that choice was not made explicit (17). the N-terminal region corresponds to the ring of tightly packed short N-terminal helices, a feature reminiscent of the C-terminal extramembrane helix found in influenza A M2 (fragment 18\u201360) molar ratio protein/detergent is significantly lower in NMR (1:200) relative to FTIR (1:50), in addition to inaccuracies of determination in the two techniques. in vitro studies show that SH protein is not essential, although it is important for effective viral infection in vivo, an importance also suggested by its strong sequence conservation. ion leakage may lead to dissipation of membrane potential and disruption of cell homeostasis. the viroporins of Sindbis virus 6K, murine hepatitis virus E protein, influenza A M2 protein, and poliovirus 2b and 3A protein have all been reported to affect apoptosis in infected cells. SV suggests that this toxicity is not uniquely mediated by a TNF- pathway. also, in MDBK and L929 cells, SH from PIV5 has a protective role against the cytopathic effect produced by PIV5 (8, 59, 71) this confirms the importance of the TM domain in the pentamerization of SH protein. in a recent electron microscopy study, very large (9 nm) structures were interpreted as pentameric or hexameric forms. the authors proposed a hexameric model, and not a pentameric one. NMR and FTIR results indicate that SH protein has one TM -helix, an N-terminal extramembrane helix, and a C-terminal hairpin-like region. the N-terminal region corresponds to the ring of tightly packed short N-terminal helices, a feature reminiscent of the C-terminal extramembrane helix. molar ratio protein/detergent is significantly lower in NMR (1:200) relative to FTIR (1:50), in addition to inaccuracies of determination. in vitro studies show that SH protein is not essential, although it is important for effective viral infection in vivo, an importance also suggested by its strong sequence conservation. a mutant H22F would form pentamers like the WT and FF. ion leakage may lead to dissipation of membrane potential and disruption of cell homeostasis, a common sign of apoptosis (67), leading to cell damage. the absence of SH protein is necessary for the inhibition of tumor necrosis factor-induced apoptosis (59, 72) the fact that the absence of SH can cause cell death in RSVSH-infected cells, compared with wild type RSV, suggests that this toxicity is not uniquely mediated by a TNF- pathway. a central pore of 19\u201326 is not compatible with the cation-selective ion channel activity observed by patch clamp. a central pore of 19\u201326 is not compatible with the cation-selective ion channel activity observed by patch clamp. a ring formed by the N-terminal helices connected via a flexible linker would be compatible with the dimensions reported by electron microscopy. the resulting oligomerization state may still be sensitive to small changes in the sequence. the resulting oligomerization state may be sensitive to small changes in the sequence. the pH activation likely mediated by histidine side chains, are also reminiscent of similar features encountered in influenza A M2, which has a \u201cTrp gating\u201d mechanism (58). further studies are required to assess the physiological relevance of the minor alternative conformation. in human RSV, mumps virus always have at least one His residue near the equivalent position of His51 in RSV SH protein, i.e. the extracellular/lumenal side (highlighted in yellow, supplemental Fig. S6) this suggests that a mutant H22F would form oligomers like WT and FF and would be activated by low pH. viroporins of Sindbis virus 6K, murine hepatitis virus E protein, influenza A M2 imian virus 5 (SV5) (71), parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV 5) (72), mump virus (8) and hRSV (72) all inhibit apoptosis in several mammalian cell lines. inhibition of apoptosis during infection may give an advantage to the virus to replicate. edward et al."}
