{"summary": "specimens were tested for influenza viruses by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of 1,790 adult SARI patients enrolled, 40% were 65 years old. only 0.1% reported receiving influenza vaccination in the past year. 10% of adults and 20%\u2013 30% of children worldwide are infected with the influenza virus each year. china has conducted nationwide influenza-like illness surveillance in hospital outpatient and emergency departments since 2000. WHO stressed the importance of conducting severe acute respiratory infection surveillance as a critical component of influenza surveillance. ize the epidemiology of SARI attributable to influenza between April 5, 2010 and April 8, 2012. we defined an adult SARI case as any person 15 years old admitted to one of the three surveillance hospitals with acute onset of self-reported fever. we defined a laboratory-confirmed influenza case as a SARI case-patient with a nasopharyngeal swab. specimens were transferred to the CDC laboratory where they were tested for influenza A, B, and influenza A virus subtypes [H1, (H1N1)pdm09, H3] by rRT PCR. test results for the rRT PCR were to be returned to the treating physicians within one week of specimen delivery. enrolled eligible case-patients meeting the SARI case definition upon or during hospitalization. a severe SARI case was defined as a SARI patient admitted to the intensive care unit during hospitalization or who died within 30 days after discharge. specimens were transferred to the CDC laboratory where they were tested for influenza A, B, and influenza A virus subtypes [H1, (H1N1)pdm09, H3] by rRT PCR. test results for the rRT PCR were to be returned to the treating physicians within one week of specimen delivery. a total of 1,790 adult SARI case patients were enrolled from April 5, 2010 to April 8, 2012. of those, 60% were male, 40% were 65 years and older. the four most common signs and symptoms upon enrollment included cough (77%) male sex 1,062 (60) 170 (60) 835 (59) 0.571 Age group 0.609 15\u201349 years 617 (35) 93 (33) 495 (35) 50-64years 454 (25) 77 (27) 360 (25) 65 years 719 (40) 111 (40) 568 (40) underlying medical condition At least one2 866 (48) 145 (52) 667 (47) 0.147 hypertension 314 (18) 40 (14) 249 (17) 0.518 Yes 38 (2) 6 (2) 25 (2) No 1,013 (57) 149 (53) 806 (57) Unknown 739 (41) 126 (45) 592 (42) Symptoms at hospital admission Cough 1,382 (77) 249 (89) 1,062 (75) 0.001 Sputum production 874 (49) 171 (61) 653 (46) 0.001 Sore throat 340 (19) 58 (21) 259 (18) 0.337 Dyspnoea median days (IQR6) From illness onset to hospital admission 1 (4) 2 (4) 1 (4) 0.030 Clinical outcome Died during hospitalization 9 (8) 8 (7) 9 (8) 0.036 Clinical outcome Died within 30 days after discharge 28 (2) 4 (1) 24 (2) 0.751 1Data is presented as no.

Predictors for severe adult SARI cases Of the 1790 enrolled adult and adolescent SARI cases, 169 (9%) met the case definition for severe SARI. 866 110 (13) 0.001 2.133 (1.532, 2.970) - No 924 59 (6) Obesity4 Yes 16 0 (0) 0.261 - No 1,721 126 (7) Currently smoke Yes 259 24 (9) 0.917 0.976 (0.620, 1.536) - No 1,531 145 (9) Temperature 38.0\u00b0C at hospital admission Yes 997 91 (9) 0.610 0.921 (0.670, 1.265) - 4Body-mass index (BMI) was calculated for patients with available height and weight data to assess obesity. missing data and \u201cunknown\u201d responses were excluded Cases not tested for influenza virus were excluded. those who self-reported taking antibiotics before hospital admission significantly less likely to have severe SARI. nearly half (48%) of enrolled case-patients had at least one underlying medical condition, the most common being hypertension (18%), chronic bronchitis (11%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (8%). 0.609 Asthma 61 (3) 17 (6) 42 (3) 0.009 Obesity3 16/1,737 (1) 3/278 (1) 12/1,378 (1) 0.947 Received seasonal trivalent influenza vaccination in the past year 0.100 Yes 2 (0) 1 (0) 1 (0) No 1,053 (59) 150 (54) 841 (59) Unknown 735 (41) 130 (46) 581 (41) Exposure history Currently smoke 259 (14) 42 (15) 204 (14) 0.790 Contact radiograph performed 1,619 (90) 257 (92) 1,282 (90) 0.479 Radiographic diagnosis of pneumonia 1,216/1,619 (75) 183/257 (71) 979/1,282 (76) 0.079 Treatment Reported taking antibiotics for current illness prior to hospital admission 0.106 Yes 806 (45) 136 (48) 622 (44) No 587 (33) 77 (27) 482 (34) Unknown 397 (22) 68 (24) 319 (22) Received the proportion of influenza positive cases among SARI cases was similar among men and women. adults aged 65 years accounted for the largest proportion of influenza-positive SARI cases (40%), followed by those aged 15\u201349 years (33%) and 50\u201364 years (27%). influenza vaccination within the prior year in both groups was close to 0%. in both groups, more than 40% did not know their influenza vaccination status. influenza activity in all age groups showed winter-spring and summer peaks during this surveillance period. a similar proportion of influenza-positive and influenza-negative SARI case-patients had severe SARI (9% vs 10%, p = 0.703) predictors for intensive care unit admission or death among adult patients with severe, acute respiratory infection (SARI) in china. influenza virus infection Yes 2 0 (0) 0.476 - - No 1,702 157 (9) Received seasonal trivalent influenza vaccination in the past year Yes 2 0 (0) 0.476 - - No 1,053 86 (8) Influenza virus infection Yes 281 25 (9) 0.703 0.917 (0.586, 1.433) - No 1,423 137 (10) 1Data is presented as no. (%) of patients unless otherwise indicated. the proportion receiving antibiotics and corticosteroids during hospitalization among both influenza positive and negative case-patients was high. 40% of influenza positive SARI cases were among adults aged 65 years, but no significant difference in the proportion of influenza-positive cases between age groups. asthma was not more commonly associated with SARI due to influenza vs SARI due to other etiologies. more studies are needed to better understand asthma as a potential risk factor for influenza-associated SARI hospitalization. a proportion of SARI cases caused by bacterial pathogens were sensitive to antibiotics taken. those who reported taking antibiotics before hospitalization were also less likely to develop severe SARI than those who did not. neuraminidase inhibitor treatment of hospitalized adults reduced mortality. oseltamivir is not prescribed routinely and is usually only administered when hospitalized patients with confirmed influenza are in critical condition. the standard operating procedure required reporting test results back to the treating physician within one week of specimen delivery. the universal use of antibiotics among hospitalized patients with influenza is concerning. corticosteroid treatment of hospitalized adults with seasonal influenza was associated with an increased risk of bacterial superinfection and mortality [25]. the use of high-dose corticosteroids can lead to irreversible adverse effects, such as osteonecrosis of the femoral head. influenza SARI cases were due to H1N1 pdm09 in the 2010 calendar year. the case definition for SARI used in this study may not have captured all patients with severe respiratory disease or those with non-respiratory symptoms. the findings are subject to several limitations."}
