{"summary": "hyperendemic dengue is characterized by epidemics that occurred relatively infrequently, and generally, each location involved a single viral serotype. the predominant pattern of global transmission today is hyperendemic dengue. surveillance studies in recent years in several countries have reported increasing age among infected patients. this has been ascribed to lowered herd immunity in the population as a result of reduced dengue in the 1970s and 1980s. studies have shown that A. aegypti bites adults more frequently than children. four serotypes have been associated with outbreaks. DEN-2 was the predominant serotype of primary infection during the outbreak in 2005. the primary vector for the dengue virus is the A. aegypti mosquito. dengue-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) are widely used in diagnosis. the test sensitivity has been demonstrated to be significantly higher in primary dengue infection (973%) than in secondary dengue infection (700%) real-time reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is widely used for clinical diagnosis and public health surveillance. it has established detection limits of 01 plaque-forming units (PFU) mL1 for DEN-1 and DEN-2, 1 PFU mL1 for DEN-3 and 001 PFU mL1 for DEN-4. DF is characterized by the sudden onset of high fever, severe headache (especially in the retro-orbital area), arthralgia, myalgia, nausea, vomiting and rash. the acute febrile illness lasts approximately 2\u20137 days. the only haemorrhagic manifestation is a positive tourniquet test and/or easy bruising Grade II Spontaneous bleeding in addition to the manifestations of grade I patients. plasma leakage manifests as tachycardia, hypotension, pleural effusions and ascites develop. severe plasma leakage results in prolonged shock, accompanied by metabolic acidosis. massive haemorrhage or encephalopathy may develop, the former requiring intensive blood transfusion support. DF is typically a self-limiting disease with a mortality rate of less than 1%. more severe infection is observed in secondary infection than in primary infection. thrombocytopenia occurs as a result of bone marrow hypocellularity. increased destruction from immune-mediated clearance of platelets becomes the primary mechanism for thrombocytopenia. age above 65 years, history of dengue infection, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and renal insufficiency have been identified as significantly associated with DHF/DSS. genetic influences, including human leucocyte antigen allele associations, may play a part in disease susceptibility and severity. clinically apparent DF resulted in 80 and 25% biting experiments at 1 and 2 days before the onset of fever. infected persons could transmit virus as early as or even earlier than 2 days before symptoms develop. intrapartum transmission in at least two cases where the onset of neonatal illness developed on the first day of life. the donor was asymptomatic at the time of donation but developed mild symptoms of DF 1 day after blood donation. an archived sample from the donation also tested positive for dengue virus by RT-PCR. the second involved the transmission of dengue from an asymptomatic blood donor. in a study of 329 healthy volunteers in a province in Thailand, 29 (88%) had a serum sample positive for dengue IgM, of which two samples tested positive for viral RNA. cluster sampling studies around index cases in Indonesia detected eight post-enrolment asymptomatic dengue infections of 785 volunteers over a 2-year period. more than half the world is now endemic for dengue. there is increasing likelihood that blood donors in these countries will be infected or exposed to infection. effect on blood donor attendance will reach levels sufficient enough to impact significantly on blood supply. dengue deferral for history of dengue infection No travel-related deferral for dengue. non-endemic except parts of northern Australia. introducing such measures during outbreaks of dengue is likely to exacerbate problems of dwindling donor attendance and decreasing blood collection described earlier. the presence of dengue viraemia in asymptomatic persons, including blood donors, is well documented during dengue epidemics. the viral loads present were in the order of 44 102 copies mL1 to 812 107 copies mL1. cell cultures were negative in five donations with viral loads between 78 and 74 103 copies mL1. the risk of infection will depend on the size of population exposed to the infection. system on apheresis platelets has shown effectiveness against dengue. pathogen reduction of platelets and plasma coupled with selective red cell inventory hold may be useful in reducing transmission risks without unnecessary donor deferral. there is little doubt that transfusion-transmitted infections will represent only a small fraction of total infections during an epidemic. asymptomatic infection Deferral based on exposure feasible leads to high donor loss Low donor loss dependent on proportion of donor population likely to travel to endemic countries Low cost-effectiveness Cost-effective NAT testing of donations for dengue Able to detect asymptomatic infection Donor loss dependent on specificity of test system Donor loss dependent on specificity of test system Expensive Expensive Cost-effectiveness depends on prevalence of asymptomatic infected donors. a report from french guiana of 22 pregnant women found no abnormality in their infants but observed a higher foetal death rate than usual. dengue infection may increase the risk for foetal mortality. most recipients of blood transfusion are in the older age group. rhage in 114 paediatric patients with DSS showed no correlation between bleeding and platelet count. prolonged duration of shock was in fact the strongest risk factor for haemorrhage. a platelet count of 5 109 L1 and packed cell volume >50 are significantly associated with the presence of bleeding manifestations. effective response was reported in 8/15 (53%) Thai children with grades III and IV DHF and life-threatening bleeding who were treated with rFVIIa. effective response was reported in 8/15 (53%) Thai children with grades III and IV DHF and life-threatening bleeding. the development of clear and specific guidelines for platelet and frozen plasma transfusion in dengue may be useful in reducing unnecessary use of blood components. wider access to medical care from health providers with knowledge of DHF can reduce death rates to less than 1%."}
