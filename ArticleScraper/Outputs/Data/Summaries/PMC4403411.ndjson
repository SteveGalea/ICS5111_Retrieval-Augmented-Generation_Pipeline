{"summary": "the infection caused 8,000 cases of SARS in humans with 10% mortality. the new virus (SARS-CoV) likely emerged from bats and an intermediate animal host (civets) might have been involved in spread (2, 3) ten years later (in 2012), another new coV emerged in the middle east as a cause of SARS-like disease in humans. a transgenic mouse model expressing the hCD26/DPP4 receptor is needed for research on MERS-CoV infection and disease. to derive such models, we used constitutive global or tissue-specific promoters, as well as an inducible, tissue-specific promoter. hCD26 expressing plasmid was constructed using pCAGGS.MCS, a eukaryotic expression vector. pCAGGS-hCD26 is a strong synthetic promoter used to derive high levels of gene expression in mammalian expression vectors. it has an advantage over the first-generation CMV promoter in that its activity does not decline over generations of transgenic mouse breeding. the expression of hCD26 antigen was detected exclusively in 17CL-1/hCD26 cells as the green fluorescent protein with an expected size of 110 kDa. confluent 17CL-1 and 17CL-1/hCD26 cells were infected with either MERS-CoV/EMC-2012 or rMERS-CoV/RFP. tail genomic DNA isolated from tail biopsy specimens was subjected to qPCR using hCD26-specific primers. tail DNA was digested by BamHI, separated on agarose gels, and transferred to Hybond-XL (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) confluent vero E6 cells were inoculated with MERS-CoV/EMC-2012 (passage 2) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001 to generate the passage 3 working stock of the virus. the cell-free supernatants derived from infected cultures were titrated using vero E6 cell-based infectivity assays. a strain of recombinant MERS-CoV expressing red fluorescent protein (rMER animals were weighed and monitored daily for clinical signs of disease and abnormalities, including appearance, stereotypical behavior/abnormal movements, decreased responsiveness or activity, and weight loss. some infected mice were sacrificed at indicated times postinfection (p.i.) to obtain tissue specimens for assessing the distribution of virus. 0.5 g of RNA was used in a one-step real-time RT-PCR kit. primer/probe mix was used for the hCD26 gene and upE gene of MERS-CoV. the primers and probes used for upE gene were as follows. the reaction volume was kept at 10 l by including 1 l (10 ng) of cDNA from these reactions. the relative abundance of transcripts of each gene was calculated according to the comparative CT method (20). 40 F TTG AAC TGG CGT TGG AAG CAC G 720\u2013851 132 R CCA CCT GTG AGT TCT TCA AAG GC 5 TNF- F TTG TCT ACT CCC AGG TTC TCT 526\u2013632 107 R GTT GAC TTT CTC CTG GTA TG 6 G-CSF F GCA GGC TCT ATC GGG TAT TTC 1895\u20132006 112 R CAC CCC 115 R TTG CCT TCA GCA CCT CTG TCC A Histology and IHC testing was performed on deparaffinized sections stained by routine hematoxylin-eosin staining. the goat anti-MERS-CoV antibody was used to assess the distribution of hCD26 expression in transgenic mice by IHC analysis. the viral receptor of MERS-CoV was cloned into pCAGGS.MCS under the control of the CAG promoter. it is a composite promoter consisting of the cytomegalovirus/immediate-early enhancer and the chicken -actin promoter, containing rabbit globulin splicing and polyadenylation sites. this promoter was chosen because it is a strong synthetic promoter frequently used to derive high levels of the hCD26 gene was cloned in this vector cassette by restriction digestion with ecoRI at the multiple cloning site (MCS) these elements were cloned into the plasmid so that the transgene could be expressed in one piece from the plasmid backbone. transgene was released from pCAGGS.hCD26 using SalI and AvrII restriction enzymes. tail genomic DNA isolated from tail biopsy specimens was subjected to qPCR using hCD26-specific primers. tail DNA was digested by BamHI, separated on agarose gels. the transgenic mouse experiments were carried out in the barrier facility of the university of Texas Medical Branch transgenic mouse core facility. all animal work conformed to national institutes of health (NIH) and AAALAC regulations and guidelines. hCD26 transgene-positive (Tg+) mice of different genetic background were equally susceptible to MERS-CoV infection. anesthetized Tg+ and Tg littermates at ages 5 to 7 weeks were inoculated via the intranasal (i.n.) route with 106 TCID50 of MERS-CoV in a total volume of 80 l. some infected mice were sacrificed at indicated times postinfection. the suspensions were clarified by centrifugation and tested in a vero E6 cell-based assay for titrating quantity of infectious virus. the virus titers of individual samples were expressed as TCID50 per g of tissue. RNA extraction and real-time quantitative qRT-PCR. RNA extracted from either lung or brain tissue was subjected to qRT-PCR analyses for quantifying transcriptional expression of selected genes encoding key cytokines and chemokines. real-time reactions were set up in duplicate for each cytokine or chemokine using endogenous mouse gene as internal controls for both brain and lung tissues. 1 IL-1 F TGG ACC TTC CAG GAG GAC A 897\u20131044 148 R GTT CAT CTC GGA GCC TGT AGT G 2 IL-2 F GGA CTT TCT GAG GAG GAT AG 498\u2013581 84 R TGT TGT AAG CAG GTA CAT AG 3 IL-6 F TAC CAC TTC ACA AGT CGG AGG C 169\u2013284 116 R CTG CAA GT ACC TCT C 152\u2013276 125 R ACA CAC TTG GTT CCT TCG A 12 IFN- F GCG GAC TTC CAC CCA G 13 IFN- F AAA TCC TGC AGA GCC AGA TTA T 299\u2013426 128 R GCT GTT GTT GTT GAA GGT AGT A 14 MX-1 F TGG ACA TTG CTA CCA CAG AGG C 773\u2013887 115 R T mouse fibroblastic 17 CL-1 cells were cotransfected with the hCD26 expression plasmid, pCAGGS-CD26, and a plasmid encoding puromycin resistance. the transfectants were assessed for level of transgene expression at the protein level by both immunofluorescence (IF) staining and Western blotting analyses. 17CL-1 cells, 17CL-1/hCD26 cells were fully susceptible to MERS-CoV infection, resulting in the development of CPE (Fig. 1D), readily detectable expression of RFP (Fig. 1E) and high yields of infectious progeny virus as early as 1 day postinfection (dpi) hCD26 transgenic mice were generated by microinjecting the expression cassette into pronuclei of zygotes from either the C57BL/6J or C57 hCD26 expression appeared to be higher in line 72 than in line 52. levels of hCD26 expression appeared to be higher in line 72 than in line 52. genemic DNA extracted from tail biopsy specimens of hCD26 transgenic founder mice of lines 52, 62, and 72 were digested by BamHI. paraffin-embedded tissues derived from Tg+ and Tg mice were subjected to IHC staining with an anti-hCD26 antibody. expression of hCD26 in the lungs was readily detectable in type I and type II alveolar pneumocytes (arrow), endothelial cells (arrow), and neurons (arrowhead) in the brain, muscle cells (arrow) in the heart, endothelial cells (arrow) and the surface of hepatocyte a ND, not determined; SB, Southern blotting; B6/C3 mix, crossed with B6C3F1/J and C57BL/6J. the line 52 founder mouse was capable of generating many first-, second-, and third-generation Tg+ pups that survived to maturity. hCD26 is a stable transgenic lineage globally expressing the hCD26 receptor for MERS-CoV. transgenic mice expressing hCD26 are permissive to MERS-CoV infection that results in disease and mortality. for a pilot study, we infected i.n. two Tg+ mice of different genetic backgrounds, but not those of Tg littermates. both hCD26 and Tg mice were challenged i.n. with 106 TCID50 of MERS-CoV in 80 l. infected mice were monitored daily for their weight gain or loss (A), other signs of clinical illness, and mortality (B) viral E gene was readily detected in alveolar pneumocytes of Tg+ (E), but not Tg (F), mice at 2 dpi. titers as high as 107 TICD50/g of lung at 2 dpi dropped at 4 dpi to 104 TCID50/g. qRT-PCR targeted the upstream E gene of MERS-CoV. a 6-log-greater level of specific viral RNA was detected in the lungs and brains of infected Tg+ mice. a disseminated infection had occurred in the hCD26 Tg+ mice. transgenic mice expressing hCD26/DPP4 are highly susceptible to a MERS-CoV infection that results in significant morbidity and mortality. pathological changes in virally challenged hCD26 Tg+ and Tg mice were assessed at 2 and 4 dpi. more extensive gross lesions of the lungs were detected in Tg+ mice. compared to a few foci of perivascular infiltration in the lungs of Tg+ mice, a more intense and widespread bronchiolitis and alveolitis was observed in the lungs of Tg+ mice. mRNA expressions of both IFN- and IFN- were observed exclusively within the lungs at 2 dpi. activated IL-12p40-encoded gene was the only gene whose expression was not induced by MERS-CoV infection in infected mice. hCD26 Tg+ mice can fully support MERS-CoV infection, resulting in morbidity and mortality. qRT-PCR targeting a panel of 14 genes encoding antiviral and proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. the relative abundance of mRNA transcripts of each gene was calculated. the results are presented as the fold changes in gene expression of infected Tg+ mice compared to that of infected Tg mice. 17CL-1/hCD26 cells and parental 17CL-1 cells were infected with either MERS-CoV or a recombinant MERS-CoV expressing red fluorescent protein (RFP) at an MOI of 1, followed by monitoring for morphological changes of infected cells. induction of hCD26 expression using this transgene construct effectively converts nonpermissive 17CL-1 cells into permissive cells, capable of fully support MERS-CoV infection. line 62 suffered from both extremely poor transgene transmissibility and neonatal deaths of Tg+ pups. the majority of Tg+ pups of Line 72 died prematurely at 3 weeks of age. hCD26 expression was higher in line 72 than in line 52, with the heart and spleen as the only exception. hCD26 mice of line 52 were euthanized. a varying intensity of hCD26 protein was detected in all tissues analyzed. hCD26 expression was readily detectable in type I and type II alveolar pneumocytes. 76 ND B6 SB/qPCR Yes The mouse died before weaning. 78 F B6 SB/qPCR Yes The mouse was fertile but did not take care of the pups. none of the pups survived beyond neonatal periods. prominent epithelial and/or endothelial hCD26 expression was detected in the liver, kidneys, and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. the expression of hCD26 was focalized within the muscularis layer of the GI tract and cardiomyocytes of the heart. this positive staining is specific to hCD26 since no staining could be detected in tissues from Tg mice. mice were monitored daily for signs of clinical illness, weight loss, and mortality. challenged Tg+, but not Tg, mice developed acute wasting syndrome. other clinical manifestations of infected Tg+ mice included ruffled fur, lethargy, inactivity, rapid and shallow breathing. Tg+ mice succumbed to infection with 100% mortality at 6 dpi. titers as high as 107 TICD50/g of lung dropped at 4 dpi to 104 TCID50/g. despite the high yields of infectious virus detected in the lung and brain of infected Tg+ mice, we were unable to isolate any infectious virus from other tissues, including the liver, heart, spleen, kidneys, and intestines. we tested for virus in all tissues collected at both 2 and 4 dpi for the presence of viral RNA by qRT-PCR targeting the upstream E gene of MERS-CoV. neuronal cells expressed abundant viral antigen in hCD26 mice at 2 and 4 dpi. this was consistent with the high titers of virus. transgenic mice expressing hCD26/DPP4 are highly susceptible to a MERS-CoV infection that results in significant morbidity and mortality. no pathological findings could be identified in other tissues collected from virus-challenged Tg+ or Tg mice. Tg+ and Tg mice were euthanized on day 2 and 4 after challenge with MERS-CoV. more extensive gross lesions of the lungs were detected in Tg+ mice than in Tg mice, starting at day 2 postchallenge. 14 genes were selected on the basis of their elevated expression in the lung and brain. elevated mRNA levels of the majority of genes analyzed were readily detected in both the lungs and brains of infected Tg+ mice. the IL-2-encoding gene was the only gene whose expression was not induced by MERS-CoV infection in Tg+ mice. total RNAs were extracted from the lungs and brains of hCD26 Tg+ and Tg mice at days 2 and 4 after infection with MERS-CoV. the results are presented as the fold changes in gene expression of infected Tg+ mice compared to that of infected Tg mice. the data displayed represent the means the standard errors of two animals. two NHP species, rhesus macaques and marmosets, and Ad5-hDPP4-transduced mice have been reported as models for MERS-CoV infection and disease (13, 14) the marmoset appears to be the best model for MERS-CoV infection and disease. pCAGGS.hCD26 plasmid was first shown to convert nonpermissive mouse 17CL-1 cells to fully susceptible to MERS-CoV infection. three founders suffered from either giving birth to very small litters or neonatal or the early death of pups. three founders (lines 62, 72, and 78) suffered from either giving birth to very small litters or neonatal or the early death of pups. an increased CD26/DPP4 expression has been shown to negatively affect the growth of endothelial cells, especially within the microvasculature network (29) therefore, the intensity of CD26/DPP4 expression within the microvasculature network appears to negatively correlate with the growth capacity of endothelial cells. the inhibition of CD26/DPP4 expression, afforded by TNF-, or IL-1 treatment or other pharmacological manipulations, appeared to promote endot studies of the kinetics and tissue distribution of MERS-CoV replication in virally challenged (i.n.) mice derived from the only transgenic lineage established (line 52) clearly indicated that a robust viral infection took place primarily in the lung and brain, making them the prime tissues for MERS-CoV infection in these animals. despite the widespread viral infection that occurred in experimentally infected rhesus macaques and marmosets, detection of viral RNA from kidneys could only be detected in marmosets. neither infectious virus nor histopathology was detected in the kidneys of infected marmosets (12, 13) lungs were the tissue with the most pathological changes, a finding consistent with its supporting an acute and robust MERS-CoV infection. pathogenesis of MERS-CoV is unknown, an ill-regulated host innate inflammatory response has been implicated as responsible, at least in part, for the acute lung injury (13, 31). innate antiviral and inflammatory responses were swiftly generated in the lungs and brains of Tg+ mice. elevated transcripts of both IFN- and the IFN-stimulated gene MX-1 were detected in mouse lungs at 2 dpi. pulmonary inflammatory responses seen in infected Tg+ mice must be dependent on interplay between alveolar macrophages, residential dendritic cells, airway epithelial cells, alveolar pneumocytes, and various cells that infiltrated the inflamed lungs. many genes related to acute inflammatory responses were significantly elevated concurrently with the intense viral replication in the infected brains. transgenic mice expressing hCD26/DPP4 as a small-animal model for MERS-CoV infection and disease remain to be investigated. this new transgenic mouse model will be useful as an additional model for studying the pathogenesis of preventive and therapeutic agents for MERS-CoV infection and disease."}
