{"summary": "in 5\u201340% of hospitalizations no infectious agent can be identified but it is suspected that a viral infection is involved [3]\u2013[5] in these cases a yet unknown virus might be the cause of respiratory illness. in the last decades several viral discovery methods have been developed which can detect viruses without knowledge of the genome sequence. reverse transcription with 96 hexamers can not anneal to rRNA, decreases the amount of background amplification and enhances the sensitivity of a virus discovery assay. endoh et al showed that reverse transcription with 96 hexamers can not anneal to rRNA, decreases the amount of background amplification and increases the sensitivity of a virus discovery assay. non-rRNA-hexamers were tested in VIDISCA by using a dilution range of human echovirus 18 culture supernatant. the cDNA was produced either with normal hexamers (containing the 4096 variants) or non-rRNA-hexamers. 3 viral fragments were amplified in the non-rRNA-hexamer amplification. the viral fragments are 167 bp, 296 bp and 382 bp in size. the product originating from rRNA (70 bp) is indicated by an arrow. both samples contained high concentrations of rRNA. non-rRNA-hexamer can not anneal at the 3\u2032site at close vicinity. one might suggest expelling the 8 hexamers that anneal at the above mentioned locations. however, endoh et al designed the non-ribosomal hexamers such that amplification of viruses is not hampered. cDNA synthesis with non-rRNA-hexamers occurs as efficient as normal hexamers. no decrease in viral genome amplification with random hexamers versus non-ribosomal hexamers. restriction enzyme, the only adaptation needed is the addition of 2 different adaptors that both can ligate to MseI digested fragments. rRNA HinP1I+MseI nr of recognition sites MseIMseI nr of fragmentsa 5.8 S rRNA 0 1 0 0 18 S rRNA 11 12 7 9 28 S rRNA 85 8 8 4 a only fragments larger than 50 nt and smaller than 600 rRNA-blocking oligo's were designed on the most prevalent rRNA sequences retrieved from VIDISCA experiments with nasopharyngeal swabs. they contain a 3\u2032 dideoxy C6 amino modification to inhibit the elongation and thus the amplification of rRNA-derived cDNA. three of the 4 regions are targeted by the rRNA-blocking oligo's. the reduction was not visible in the fragment that was not targeted by a blocker (1780\u20131880 of 28S rRNA), which is as expected. in sample II no diminished signal was observed at 18S rRNA 1000-region. the concentration of respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal swabs is in the main below 1 E6 copies/ml. we can assume that a yet unknown virus will be present in similar concentrations. high throughput sequencing is a relatively new method. the 18 samples were assigned positive via specific diagnostic PCRs. each sample was processed with its own identifier sequence that allows pooling during emulsion PCR. the frequency of viral sequences per sample ranged between 0.01% and 40.5%. 0.04% 0.8% A2829 Influenza A 8.9 E5 Influenza A 9924 14 0.14% 11% E0061 HCoV-NL63 1.0 E4 HCoV-NL63 8641 3 0.03% 0.8% I1647 RSV 3.3 E6 RSV 3497 167 4.8% 4% I4335 Influenza B 1.5 E4 - 2283 0 0,04% O1189 HRV 1.2 E5 - 4030 0 0.02% E01 non-rRNA-hexamers were tested in VIDISCA by using a dilution range of human echovirus 18 culture supernatant (1 E8\u20131 E4 copies/ml), a virus harvest of which it contains competitor rRNA. 3 viral fragments were amplified in the non-rRNA-hexamer amplification, whereas only 1 viral fragment was amplified. VIDISCA products were generated with primers Hinp-A/Mse-C. the viral fragments are 167 bp, 296 bp and 382 bp in size. non-rRNA-hexamers are designed to anneal not or hardly to rRNA. some do perfectly match with human rRNA, especially in the region 3800 to 4000. however, in regions where we show strong decrease in rRNA cDNA synthesis, non-rRNA-hexamer can not anneal at the 3\u2032site at close vicinity. cDNA synthesis with all 4096 random hexamers and without rRNA-blocking oligo's. d binding region for blocking oligo 4-Morrna. g binding region for blocking oligo 1-Morrna. investigation of human rRNAs revealed that 28S rRNA contains a very high number of Hinp1-I recognition sites. the high frequency of HinP1-I digestion in 28S rRNA and the generation of small digested fragments likely interfere in the VIDISCA-ligation. VIDISCA fragments are visualized on a 1% metaphor gel. the dots indicate viral fragments which were only visible with MseI digestion. rRNA-blocking oligos were designed to block amplification of ribosomal RNA. rRNA-cDNA reverse trancription efficiency was based on the VIDISCA fragments of which we know that they are generated in VIDISCA amplification. on average a 50% reduction of rRNA amplification was noticed at the regions that were targeted by the rRNA-blocking oligo's. in sample II no diminished signal was observed at 18S rRNA 1000-region. non-rRNA-hexamers were tested in VIDISCA using a dilution range of human echovirus 18 culture supernatant (1 E8\u20131 E4 copies/ml) the cDNA was produced either with normal hexamers (containing the 4096 variants) or non-rRNA-hexamers. 3 viral fragments were amplified in the non-rRNA-hexamer amplification. VIDISCA products were generated with primers Hinp-A/Mse-C. the viral fragments are 167 bp, 296 bp and 382 bp in size. non-rRNA-hexamer can not anneal at the 3\u2032site at close vicinity. endoh et al designed the non-ribosomal hexamers to further enhance the benefit of non-rRNA cDNA synthesis. cDNA synthesis with random hexamers occurs as efficient as normal hexamers. no decrease in viral genome amplification with random hexamers versus non-ribosomal hexamers. rRNAs revealed that 28S rRNA contains a very high number of Hinp1-I recognition sites. but relatively low frequency of restriction sites interferes in the VIDISCA-ligation. the only adaptation needed is the addition of 2 different adaptors. rRNA-blocking oligo's were designed on the most prevalent rRNA sequences retrieved from VIDISCA experiments with nasopharyngeal swabs. rRNA-blocking oligo's decreased rRNA-cDNA synthesis in VIDISCA. we monitored cDNA synthesis via real time PCRs at 3 regions of 28S rRNA and 1 region of 18S rRNA. three of the 4 regions are targeted by the rRNA-blocking oligo's. on average a 50% reduction of rRNA amplification was noticed at the regions that were targeted by the rRNA-blocking oligo's. rRNA-blocking oligo's Ct Values HCoV-NL63 + 14.8 13.6 Coxsackievirus B4 + 18.5 19.0 VIDISCA combined with high throughput sequencing In figure 1 it is shown that the sensitivity of VIDISCA reaches 1 E6 viral genome copies/ml. samples were selected randomly from a large sample set collected during the GRACE study. each sample was processed with its own identifier sequence that allows pooling during emulsion PCR. in total 202.975 reads were generated of which 4406 were viral (2.2%) nr Respiratory virus Viral load copies/ml Result VIDISCA-454 Nr of reads Nr of reads Nr of viral reads % genome coverage A0211 Human PIV-1 1.2 E3 -
