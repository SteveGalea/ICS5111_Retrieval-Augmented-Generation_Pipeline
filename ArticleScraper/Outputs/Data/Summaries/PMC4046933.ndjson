{"summary": "arenaviruses are enveloped RNA viruses with bi-segmented, negative-sense genomic RNA. they are divided into the Old World (Lassa-Lymphocytic choriomeningitis complex) arenaviruses and the New World (Tacaribe complex) arenaviruses are highly divergent from known arenaviruses. research work utilizing infectious JUNV requires a high-containment biosafety level 4 facility in the united states. the original human pathogenic XJ strain had been serially passaged in guinea pigs and mice but not for young mice infected intracranially. both pathogenic and vaccine strains of JUNV were highly sensitive to interferon treatment in murine primary cells. the multiplication of JUNVs was enhanced in IRF3/IRF7 deficient cells. intron A, Schering Corporation, NJ), IFN-1a (PBL, NJ) or IFN- (Sigma-Aldrich, MO) at 125, 250, 500 and 1000 U/ml for 16 h. cells were then infected with VSV, candid#1 JUNV or Romero JUNV. antibodies HRP-conjugated Goat anti-mouse IgG (115-035-146, Jackson Immunology) and donkey anti-goat IgG (sc-2020, Santa Cruz) were used. growth kinetics of JUNV in wild-type MEF and IRF3/7 knockout MEF were confirmed at MOI of 0.1 or 0.001. sensitivity to IFN treatment Vero and A549 cells were seeded into 96-well plates for 24 h and treated with human IFN--2b (Intron A, Schering Corporation, NJ), IFN-1a (PBL, NJ) or IFN- (Sigma-Aldrich, MO) as indicated. cells were then infected with VSV, Candid#1 JUNV or Romero JUNV at an MOI of 0.1 PFU/cell membranes were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C and then with appropriate secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. proteins were visualized with ECL Western Blotting Detection Reagents (GE, NJ) cells were treated with the pathogenic Romero strain or the vaccine strain candid#1 JUNV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) at 72 hr post infection (p. i.) virus titers in tissue culture supernatants were determined by plaque assay. the result showed that IFN-mediated a potent antiviral effect against both Romero and candid#1 JUNV infection in MEF cells. vero cells and A549 cells were treated with human IFN-2b (Schering), IFN- (PBL) or IFN- (Sigma), while MEF cells were treated with mouse IFN- (PBL), respectively. cells were then infected with VSV, candid#1 JUNV or Romero JUNV at an MOI of 0.1 PFU/cell. the pathogenic Romero virus replicated more efficiently than the vaccine strain candid#1 virus. we characterized JUNV growth in primary MEF cells at an MOI of 0.1. the peak titer of Romero virus was about 240-fold of that of candid#1 virus (1.5103 PFU/ml) at 4 d.p.i. the growth of candid#1 virus was below the detection level in wt MEF or IRF3/7 KO MEF cells at an MOI of 0.001. wild-type MEF cells and IRF3/7 knockout MEF cells were infected by Romero virus at an MOI of 0.1. treatment with 1 U/ml of IFN- almost abolished viral NP protein expression at days 1 and 2 p.i. NP protein is one of the early viral gene products expressed during virus infection. NP protein expression was inhibited by 90% in the presence of 500 U/ml human IFN-. a low dose of murine IFN- treatment (1 U/ml) resulted in drastic decrease in virus titers by over 3-log for Candid#1 and by 2.7-log for Romero JUNV. the multiplication of candid#1 was completely abolished in MEF cells treated with 1 U/ml IFN-, while the multiplication of Romero virus was abolished at 50 U. titers of some IFN-sensitive LCMV strains decreased by approximately 2-log. mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (MEF), (B) Vero cells (ATCC) and (C) human lung carcinoma epithelial A549 cells (ATCC) were treated with IFNs at the indicated concentrations for 16 h. 125 U/ml human IFN- suppressed virus growth by 2-log and 3-log. treatment with 500 U/ml human IFN- reduced virus titer by more than 6-log. both strains of JUNV were relatively more sensitive to IFN in A549 cells than in vero cells. candid#1 virus grew at lower peak titers in both cell lines. growth of candid#1 virus was below detection level in wt or wt. the titer of candid#1 virus was below the detection level in both MEFs at an MOI of 0.001. we studied the effect of IFN treatment on viral replication to understand the mechanism of IFN-induced antivirus activity. cell lysates were prepared at 1 and 2 days p.i. from MEF cells and A549 cells, or at 2 days p.i. from Vero cells. the viral NP protein was detected with a monoclonal mouse anti-JUNV NP antibody (AG12, BEI) equine encephalitis virus [26] targets viral RNA lacking 2\u2032O-methylated cap structure or containing tri-phosphate group at the 5\u2032-end. future studies are required to identify which steps of virus replication are blocked by IFN treatment. activated IRF7 further stimulates the expression of other IFNs. it is possible that exogenous IFN- could induce the synthesis of various subtypes of endogenous IFN in IFN-production competent A549 cells. the high sensitivity of JUNVs to IFN in murine cells might explain the requirement of intact IFN pathway for adult mice to be resistant to JUNV. hagic fever (AHF) patients have been associated with severe and lethal disease outcomes. the role of IFN in JUNV pathogenesis remains unclear. the mouse is not the natural host for JUNV, but our results with murine cells provide some insights into the basis for virus attenuation. a systemic characterization of the effect of candid#1-specific mutations on viral RNA transcription/replication in murine systems is warranted by using the JUNV reverse genetic systems. the impaired virus growth in murine cells for Candid#1 strain is biologically relevant to its attenuation."}
