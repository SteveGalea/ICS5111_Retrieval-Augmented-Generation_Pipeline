Akt/PKA sites were the most prevalent; 16 phosphopeptides that contained Akt/PKA sites were detected in our screens. this raises the possibility that GH activation of Akt plays a greater role in GH signaling. 1 ser707 fell into the category of Akt/PKA substrate sites. we also tested for phosphorylation at two additional Akt/PKA substrate sites. all of these sites were previously identified as phosphosites with regulatory function in context of other stimuli. ACLY is the primary enzyme responsible for the synthesis of cytosolic acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) in many tissues. cell lysates from 3T3-F442A preadipocytes were treated with GH for varying amounts of time. immunoblotting with phosphospecific antibodies confirmed a rapid and robust GH-dependent phosphorylation of Shc Tyr423. whole-cell lysates were immunoblotted with pY423-Shc, Shc, pS184-PRAS40, pT247-PRAS40, and PRAS40 as indicated. the results are representative of three separate experiments. ns, Nonspecific. dylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor blocks GH activation of Akt (68) and then with GH for 15 or 30 min. efficacy of wortmannin at inhibiting Akt activity was determined by blotting with antibody to Akt pSer473 or with a phosphospecific antibody to the S6 kinase 1 substrate Ser235/Ser236 in ribosomal S6. GH-induced phosphorylation of ACLY, PRAS40, and raptor is inhibited by wortmannin. whole-cell lysates were immunoblotted with pS455-ACLY, ACLY, pT247-PRAS40, PRAS40, S473-Akt, pS235/236-S6 kinase. 3T3-F442A preadipocytes have previously been used to identify and/or characterize multiple GH signaling proteins and pathways. these include JAK2, Stats 1, 3, 5a, and 5b (5, 40\u201342), Shc/grb2/SOS/Ras/Raf/MEK/Erks1/2 (9, 43), and insulin receptor substrate 1/2/PI3K/Akt (10, 11, 44, 45) the number of phosphosites in the various categories includes 1) unique localized phosphosites, and 2) unique unlocalized phosphosites that reside in peptides that do not contain a localized site. the amount of the decrease required for significance was small (20% decrease) for borderline phosphosites, if the phosphosite was detected in a second trial, often the fold change fell below statistical relevance. phosphopeptides with unlocalized phosphorylation sites were localized. a total of 230 unique GH-dependent phosphosites were localized on 141 different proteins. phosphorylation at 96 sites decreased by more than 30%.

KEGG pathway analysis categorizes proteins that contain phosphosites that increased with GH treatment at 5 or 15 min. four pathways contained five or more proteins that exhibited GH-dependent phosphorylation. the identification of previously unknown, GH-regulated proteins highlights proteins that have the potential to broaden our understanding. phosphosites in raptor and eukaryotic initiation factor 4B were not previously known to be GH-regulated sites. a total of 10 GH-dependent phosphosites in seven proteins lie within the mTOR signaling pathway. a total of 10 GH-dependent phosphosites in seven proteins lie within the mTOR signaling pathway. k2 (Thr179, Thr183, Tyr185) NHE1 (Ser707) Ppp1r12a (Ser507, Ser509, Ser870, Ser861) Myh9 (Thr1938) Focal adhesion Filamin-C (Ser2234) Zyxin (Ser336) Parvin (Thr16, Ser19) Ppp1r12a (Ser507, Ser509, Ser870, Ser861) Shc ( after 5 min of GH treatment, 93 of the GH-stimulated phosphosites were in known consensus phosphorylation motifs. the majority of the 93 phosphosites were in consensus recognition sites for Akt/protein kinase A (PKA), PKA, casein kinase (CK)1, ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CamK)2, glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GS PRAS40 Thr247 and NHE1 Ser707 fell into the category of Akt/PKA substrate sites. we also tested for phosphorylation at two additional Akt/PKA substrate consensus sites. all of these sites were previously identified as phosphosites with regulatory function in the context of other stimuli. ACLY is the primary enzyme responsible for the synthesis of cytosolic acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) in many tissues. a rapid, modest GH-dependent phosphorylation of Ser455 in ACLY and ser 330 in NDRG1 was also observed. 3T3\u2013F442A preadipocytes were treated (A and C) with GH [500 ng/ml (23 nm)] or (B) with GH (100 ng/ml) the results are representative of three separate experiments. wortmannin is a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor that blocks GH activation of Akt (68) and then with GH for 15 or 30 min. the efficacy of wortmannin at inhibiting Akt activity was determined by blotting with antibody to Akt pSer473 or with a phosphospecific antibody to the kinase 1 substrate Ser235/Ser236. pS863-raptor, -raptor, pErk1/2, pS473-Akt contributes to GH-induced phosphorylation of raptor Ser863. GH-induced phosphorylation of ACLY, PRAS40, and raptor is inhibited by wortmannin. the GH response determined by phosphoproteomics varied from robust to subtle. but immunoblotting confirmed all seven sites tested, even those with the most subtle increases, including four that were picked up in only one of the three screens. we did not expect complete coverage for multiple reasons. sequential MSMS scans are obtained in the LTQ to determine their peptide sequence. ion derived from a particular phosphopeptide greatly influences the probability that the ion will be selected for MSMS sequencing. a technical replicate increased the number of identified peptides by about 20% on average. SILAC-based phosphoproteomics analysis is a very powerful method to detect novel GH-regulated proteins. many phosphosites are not identifiable either because tryptic fragments are too large or too small for identification or because their sequence-specific properties lead to low efficiency ionization or fragmentation. even those phosphopeptides that were detected in only one screen have a high likelihood of being valid. GH signaling has been shown to phosphorylate and activate Akt (13, 45) but the prominent representation of Akt/mTOR pathway components in our phosphoproteomics analysis was unexpected. the Akt-regulated mTOR signaling pathway was one of the top four pathways in KEGG pathway analysis of our data. phosphosites identified by phosphoproteomics are predicted to be phosphorylated by Akt/PKA Gene Protein Phosphosite5 Ratio. mTOR and Erk1/2-mediated raptor Ser863 phosphorylation has been shown to promote multisite raptor phosphorylation. phosphopeptides identified during the SILAC-based phosphoproteomics screens were analyzed by MaxQuant to predict phosphosites with best-fit motif consistent with phosphorylation by Akt. numbering in parentheses is according to PhosphositePlus (http://www.phosphosite.org). SILAC and MS-based phosphoproteomic study reveals 214 GH-dependent phosphosites in 133 proteins that have yet to be studied. proteins in the KEGG category \u201cinsulin signaling pathway\u201d include a number of signaling proteins shared by multiple growth factors that activate tyrosine kinases. multiple focal adhesion proteins have been shown to undergo GH-dependent changes in tyrosyl phosphorylation (18, 81, 82) of the seven proteins containing GH-enhanced phosphosites, four (filamin, zyxin, parvin, Ppp1r12a/regulatory subunit of myosin light chain phosphatase) had not been identified previously as GH-regulated proteins. GH signaling reportedly inhibits GSK3 (45). GH signaling reportedly inhibits GSK3 (45). Akt is a member of the AGC family of kinases. another kinase that respond positively to GH seems more likely to be the responsible kinase. these studies are the first to use mass-spectrometry and SILAC-based phosphoproteomics to identify novel proteins involved in GH signaling. the results provide multiple new candidates for study, some of which have the potential to break new ground in our quest to understand the full range of GH responses."}
