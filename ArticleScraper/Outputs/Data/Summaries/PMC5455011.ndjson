{"summary": "studies on the activities of RNA in the cell have revolutionized our understanding of the many roles played by this macromolecule. this article will deal with the contrasting effects that the avian paramyxovirus newcastle disease virus (NDV) exerts in different species like birds, mice and humans. avian paramyxovirus type I (APMV-1) causes serious disease in chickens and other birds known as ND. velogenic strains are highly infectious in birds. there are viscerotropic and neurotropic pathotypes. the first contact of the virus in permissive hosts occurs with respiratory epithelial cells. lentogenic strains of NDV usually cause respiratory disease in adult chickens. the virus is very sensitive to heat (10 to 20 min at 56 \u00b0C), lipid solvents, ionic and nonionic detergents, formaldehyde and oxidizing agents. the virion is enveloped with a lipid membrane from the host cell plasma membrane. the nucleocapsid has the classical herringbone morphology with a diameter of 18 nm. a batch is certified and released only when all batch specification and release criteria are fulfilled. the complete genome sequences for many strains of NDV are available on the web at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. 90% of the viral genome carries coding sequences. a leader RNA of 55 nt is synthesized, followed by sequential transcription of the genes in the 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 order to yield individual mRNAs. the leader RNA is neither capped nor polyadenylated and is not functional as mRNA. the recovery of recombinant NDV requires activity of the T7 RNA polymerase. this enzyme can be provided by a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the T7 gene or by a cell line which constitutively expresses this polymerase. a majority of bird species developed approximately 66 million years ago according to a recent whole-genome analysis. the virus spreads rapidly between premises by either inhalation or ingestion. the generalized signs of ND include depression, loss of appetite, severe dehydration, emaciation and fever. lentogenic strains of NDV usually cause respiratory disease in adult chickens. the world organization for animal health uses two parameters to differentiate between virulent isolate (notifiable disease) and avirulent isolate (notifiable disease) the real-time RT-PCR (RRT-PCR) offers the highest sensitivity. the virus is very sensitive to UV irradiation and resistant to -irradiation. a batch is certified and released only when all batch specification and release criteria are fulfilled. the complete genome sequences for many strains of NDV are available online at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. the leader and trailer are the control regions essential not only for transcription and replication, but also for encapsidation of newly synthesized RNAs into virus particles. about 90% of the viral genome carries coding sequences. a suitable cell line is transfected with a plasmid expressing the full-length antigenomic RNA. the recovery of recombinant NDV requires activity of the T7 RNA polymerase. this enzyme can be provided by a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the T7 gene or by a cell line which constitutively expresses this polymerase. NDV has the ability to replicate up to 10,000-fold faster in human cancer cells than in most normal human cells. it is known to enter cells by binding to sialic acid residues, which are present on most human cancer cells, making it suitable for use in a broad range of cancer cell types. pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) from NDV recognized by respective pattern recognition receptors from innate immunity cells. PRRs initiate multiple response pathways leading to a strong type I interferon response, to release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and to activation of immune cells. a paracrine stimulation assay in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) cell surface expression of TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and secretion of IFN- is shown. the effect of NDV on human dendritic cells (DCs) has been studied using technologies developed by systems biology. IFN- and IFN- exhibit antiproliferative effects by p53 induction, CD8+ T lymphocyte and macrophage activation, chemokine secretion and miR-21 downregulation [48]. studies with human Cells NDV induces in human PBMC, DCs and monocytes a strong type I IFN response [4,6,15,40]. in vitro, the addition of a neutralizing anti-IFN antibody inhibited the CTL response. the augmented tumor-specific response observed in mice immunized with NDV infected tumor cells was mediated via IFN-/ [51] and was a result of CD4+ and CD8+ immune T cell cooperation. Vp35 antagonises the early phase of the interferon response. it binds directly to dsRNA and inhibits anti-viral signaling. it also blocks virus induced IRF3 phosphorylation. in man type I interferon response counteracted by two viral proteins: Vp35 and Vp24 [56,57] Vp35 mediated interaction with dsRNA leading to downregulation of IRF3, PKR and eIF-2 [56] Vp24 mediated interaction with STAT1 leading to downregulation of its nuclear translocation. anti-tumor effects in Vivo Intra-tumoral and intra-peritoneal injection of oncolytic NDV (mesogenic attenuated intra-tumoral virotherapy with NDV induced through ICD long-term survival [42] induced protective immunity was dependent on a functional adaptive immune system and on CD8+ T cells. induced immunity included CD4+ Th and CD8+ CTL [51,52], was highly specific, protected against outgrowth of metastases and increased significantly the percentage of long-term surviving mice [62] localized oncolytic NDV virotherapy was demonstrated to overcome systemic tumor resistance to immune checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. this is important and suggests that results from clinical application of immune checkpoint blockade immunotherapy can be improved by combination with oncolytic NDV. in non-permissive hosts, such mutations make tumor cells to a relatively permissive substrate for the replication of RNA viruses such as NDV. identifying mechanisms that can explain tumor selectivity of viral replication and oncolysis in non-permissive hosts involve: (i) defects in activation of anti-viral signaling pathways [27]; (ii) defects in type I IFN signaling pathways [28]; (iii) defects in apoptotic pathways [29]; the features of ICD induced by NDV in tumor cells include an endoplasmatic reticulum stress response, immunogenic apoptosis, necrosis and autophagy. such features lead to shutdown of protein synthesis, surface exposure of calreticulin, heat-shock proteins (HSPs) and of the viral proteins HN and F. post-Oncolytic Immune Response In an orthotopic murine glioma model it was demonstrated that NDV virotherapy induces ICD with its molecular determinants. this is followed by tumor-specific immune T cell memory [42]. this type of polarization favors the induction of T helper type 1 (Th1) T cell responses upon antigen presentation by the DCs. polarization favors the induction of T helper type 1 (Th1) T cell responses upon antigen presentation by the DCs. ine Cells In murine studies an association was described between the strength of the type I interferon response and the resistance of cells (normal or neoplastic) to virus replication following infection by NDV. the studies revealed an important role in the IFN response of RIG-I, IRF3, IFN- and IRF7. IFN- and - molecules interact with the cell surface expressed -chain of the type I IFN receptor (IFNRA) this initiates an amplification loop of the IFN response involving STAT proteins and the interferon regulatory factor IRF-9. the studies revealed an important role in the IFN response of RIG-I, IRF3, IFN- and IRF7. immune escape from type I interferon responses in permissive avian cells is mediated via the V protein, a frameshift variant of the viral phosphoprotein P. the V protein shows specificity for avian proteins and does not interfere with the IFN response in mammalian cells.

non-avian vertebrate species. potential to break therapy Resistancies NDV has the capacity to replicate in non-proliferating tumor cells, such as X-irradiated tumor vaccine cells. resistance to immunotherapy can also be broken by melanoma infection. a number of lentogenic strains have been used for preventive vaccination against ND in poultry industry. a recombinant ND vaccine was approved by the US FDA for commercial use. a recombinant ND vaccine was recently approved by the US FDA for commercial use. a robust immune response is required to completely cease virus replication. this can likely only be induced by both envelope glycoproteins and participation of innate and adaptive cell mediated and humoral immune responses. oncolytic paramyxoviruses have oncolytic and/or other anti-neoplastic properties. the patients (n = 79) were given escalating doses of virus intravenously. their tumors had not responded to conventional therapy. they were given escalating doses of virus intravenously. the vaccine was termed ATV-NDV. it consisted of 10 million irradiated tumor cells, which had been infected with NDV. the anti-metastatic effects observed in the pre-clinical studies have been summarized elsewhere. a prospectively randomized Phase II/III trial investigated the effectiveness of ATV-NDV after liver resection for hepatic metastases of colorectal carcinoma (CRC) a significant benefit was seen in the colon but not in the rectum cancer subgroup in terms of long-term metastasis-free survival and OS. in the colon cancer control arm, 78.6% had died, in the vaccinated arm only 30.8%. transfer to NOD/SCID mice bearing autologous human tumor xenotransplants was capable of tumor rejection [85], thus demonstrating their importance. table 2 summarizes the various mentioned anti-tumor effects of NDV in mouse and man. treatment by ATV-NDV with Attached Bispecific Antibody. one strategy of improvement consisted in the augmentation of costimulatory signals. this can be achieved by the attachment to ATV-NDV of NDV-specific single chain antibodies. new strategy of cancer immunotherapy at IOZK combines hyperthermia and oncolytic virus pretreatment with specific autologous anti-tumor vaccination. hyperthermia can activate the immune system when it is adjusted to reach a tissue temperature of 38.5 to 40.5 \u00b0C. hyperthermia can activate the immune system when it is adjusted to reach a tissue temperature of 38.5 to 40.5 \u00b0C. a median Overall Survival (OS) of 30 months has to be compared to 14.6 months after standard radio/chemotherapy according to the Stupp protocol. a 5-year survival in the current series with combinatorial immunotherapy of almost 20% [86]. the reported side effects are mild (grade 1 and 2), with the most common being mild fever [4,15]. 5.2. treatment by Oncolytic NDV In the 1990s, a placebo-controlled Phase II clinical trial performed by Csatary in Hungary included 33 late-stage cancer patients in the NDV treatment group. patients with stage II metastatic melanoma reported as early as 1965 on NDV (oncolytic strain 73 T) as an antineoplastic agent. they used such vaccines for post-operative management of malignant melanoma patients. more than 10 Phase I to II clinical post-operative vaccination studies were performed in patients with different types of cancer in the years from 1990 to 2008. the trials involved, among others, carcinomas of breast [78], colon, rectum [79], kidney [80], head and neck [81], pancreas [77] and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) there was no significant difference between the vaccinated and the control arm. in the colon cancer control arm, 78.6% had died, in the vaccinated arm only 30.8%. the latter trial corroborated similar results (about 30% increase in OS) in most of the other studies. treatment by ATV-NDV with Attached Bispecific Antibody In spite of promising results, we generated new ideas for further improvements. one strategy of improvement consisted in the augmentation of T-cell costimulatory signals. patients with late-stage disease that could no longer be subjected to surgery with curative intent were treated with ATV-NDV-bsHN-CD28. no severe adverse events were noticed in this Phase I trial. in vitro, CD4+ T helper cells increased the maturation of human DCs better than the maturation stimuli CD40-L and IFN- [89] one case-report from IOZK demonstrates long-term remission of prostate cancer in a patient with extensive bone metastases. the patient survived more than 66 months after the initial diagnosis. recombinant NDV as a Vaccine Vector Recent studies underline the potential of recombinant NDV (recNDV) as a vaccine vector. the expression levels of foreign proteins, such as influenza virus hemagglutinin, are high and the foreign genes are very stable. a live attenuated vaccine completely protected chickens and mice from lethal challenge with homologous and heterologous H5N1 avian influenza viruses. similar results have been obtained with recNDV engineered to express the spike S. glycoprotein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) a recNDV vector could become very useful in future. a recNDV vector could be used to harness oncolytic virus-mediated anti-tumor immunity and for using NDV as vector against new emerging virus diseases. recNDV can be engineered even with two genes to secrete full intact antibodies if respective heavy and light chains of IgG from a hybridoma are incorporated into the viral genome. new viruses can cause epidemics and pose huge public health problems and economic losses within a short time. a study of interaction of APMV with human cells revealed that the virus is able to evade the IFN system by inhibiting the regulation of interferon-stimulated genes. the virus was capable, during evolution, of adapting to the immune system of birds by generating the frameshift. variant protein V interferes with the type I interferon response of cells from birds. new viruses causing fatal diseases in man developed similar viral interferon escape mechanisms. such vectors protect chickens against H5N1 avian influenza virus. there is good reason to expect many benefits from further research and application of NDV. there is good reason to expect many benefits from further research."}
