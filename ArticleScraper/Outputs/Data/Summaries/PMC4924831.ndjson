{"summary": "study was performed using nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs collected during the H1N1 pandemic influenza. the IFITM3 rs12252 was genotyped by RFLP and tested for association with hospitalization. most people infected with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus experienced mild disease, with upper respiratory illness similar to seasonal influenza virus infection. gastrointestinal symptoms occurred more frequently in patients infected with pandemic influenza virus than in those with seasonal influenza. animal models seem to support the biologic plausibility of a genetic susceptibility to influenza A virus. it has been shown that an interferon inducible transmembrane 3 protein (IFITM3) profoundly alters the course of influenza virus infection in a knockout mouse model. recent studies suggest a close association between the IFITM3 rs12252 variant (C allele) and influenza severity infection. s12252 variant (C allele) and risk of hospitalization due to respiratory illness in portugal patients with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection. case-control genetic association study comparing frequency of IFITM3 rs12252 variant between hospitalized influenza-like illness (ILI) patients (cases) and non hospitalized ILI patients (controls) was performed. ILI negative patients were ILI patients who were swabbed and tested negative for the Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. all included patients were selected from the INSA cases. the following exclusion criteria were used to perform the selection. nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs were collected into a suitable transport medium for preservation of virus, molecular diagnostic and virus culture. real-time reverse transcriptase PCR methodologies and platforms were used for laboratory diagnosis. ele and the originated fragments were visualized on a 2% agarose gel. Statistical analysis was performed using the R program [18]. P-values0.05 were considered statistically significant. 62089 ILI cases were reported to the laboratory network during the H1N1 pandemic. 7780 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 positive cases were identified at INSA 16376 samples for Influenza diagnosis. patients for whom the time lapse between the symptoms onset and the sample collection was over 7 days, to avoid misclassification due to low viral load of the sample collected. 312 hospitalized patients were identified after the exclusion criteria application. hospitalization was used as a measure of disease severity. additional diagnoses, viral isolation, antigenic and genetic characterization of viral isolates were performed according to the procedures previously described [15]. During the 2009/10 influenza season, the laboratory network just carried out the laboratory diagnosis of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 requested by the national health service. samples were only tested for the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, influenza A(H1), influenza A(H3) and influenza B virus. the analysis was stratified by ILI A(H1N1)pdm09 positive and negative patients. hospitalized patients were considered the cases and non-hospitalized patients were considered the controls. the analysis was stratified using the Hardy Weinberg R package [19]. p Age (years) Mean sd 16.6 17.6 14.0 12.4 0.8151 15.7 20.2 13.5 16.1 0.3821 Median (range) 10 (0\u201360) 9 (0\u201354) 4 (0\u201364) 6 (0\u201362) Gender % of women 40.5 46.2 0.3822 43.9 47.3 0.4682 (95% CI) (30.0\u201351.0) CC (%) 2 (2.4) 0 (0) 0 (0) 1 (0.28) Alleles C (%) 13 (7.7) 32 (8.7) 39 (11.3) 40 (5.7) T (%) 155 (92.3) 336 (91.3) 207 (92.3) 662 (94.3) Dominant model1 CT/CC (%) 11 (13.1) 32 (17.4) 39 (22.5) 39 (11.1) vs TT (%) 73 (86.9) 152 (82.6) 134 (77.5) we performed a stratified analysis to assess if there is a higher risk of hospitalization for patients with the C allele both in the presence and absence of the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection. we observed that there is not a higher risk of being hospitalized for patients with the CT/CC genotype compared to the TT genotype. the risk of being hospitalized is significantly higher than the risk of being hospitalized in the TT genotype carriers. the Portuguese laboratory network just carried out the influenza virus detection (influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, influenza A(H1) seasonal, influenza A(H3) and influenza B virus) the future detection of other respiratory agents in the analyzed samples would be important to clarify our results. general population data are from the European 1000 genomes. we have reduced this bias by excluding patients with disease onset reported in the contention phase. we only performed the confounding adjustment for age and sex variables in the logistic regression analysis. a large number of cases would be needed to better define this association in our population. it will be important to perform an integrative approach to clarify why some healthy individuals resist infection or recover quickly. it could be done by considering not only the virus-host genome interactions but also immunity, vaccination, weather conditions and other environmental factors that could help clarify the present results."}
