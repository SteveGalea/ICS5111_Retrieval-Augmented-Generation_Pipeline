{"summary": "introduction RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is widely used to measure expression levels of multiple genes simultaneously. RNA-seq is also used for genome annotation, enabling the study of gene transcription, RNA processing and various other biological functions. RNA-seq or small RNA sequencing (sRNA-seq) is indispensable for the annotation of non-coding genes. parallel analysis of RNA Ends and sequencing (PARE-seq), Cap Analysis of Gene Expression and sequencing (CAGE-seq) and Precision nuclear run-On and sequencing (PRO-seq) have been developed to identify the 5\u2032 ends of mature RNAs (Bouvy-Liivrand et al., 2017). 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 end small RNAs (5\u2032 and 3\u2032 sRNAs) were found in human mitochondrial DNA. in this study, we demonstrated that 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 sRNAs alone can be used to annotate nuclear non-coding and mitochondrial genes. this method provides a simple and cost-effective way to annotate nuclear non-coding and mitochondrial genes and identify new steady RNAs. 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 sRNAs are defined as sRNA reads with lengths of 1550 bp. the cleavage sites between 3\u2032 sRNAs and their downstream 5\u2032 sRNAs are not limited to one. the last criterion can be used to identify new steady RNAs. -seq reads with lengths of 1550 bp, which are precisely aligned to the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of mature RNAs. the lengths of them vary progressively with 1-bp differences. as for longer RNAs, there could be abundant sRNAs in the body. chromosome ID; (2) 1-based coordinate of this position; (3) reference base; (4) depth (the number of reads covering the position); (5) ratio-1 (the number of positive-stranded reads starting at this position divided by the total number of positive-stranded reads); (7) ratio-2 (the number of negative-stranded reads starting at this position divided by the total number of negative-stranded reads); and(8) the number of negative-stranded reads starting at this position ITS2 were derived using the annotations of 18S, 5.8S and 28S rRNA (Figure 2A) the corrected annotations of human rRNA genes were validated using the CAGE-seq dataset and the GRO-seq dataset. the depth of 1,471,247 reads at position 6,601 was much higher than the depth of 647,406 reads at position 6,596. these reads are from one sRNA-seq dataset (A) one CAGE-seq dataset (B) and one GRO-seq dataset (C) the description of these datasets can be seen in the Section \u201cMaterials and Methods\u201d. the proportions of these four types were 5.26% (22,906/435,595), 12.36% (53,845/435,595), 13.81% (60,176/435,595), and 68.57% (298,668/435,595). tRNAs were produced by tRNA degradation during its synthesis. the genome-alignment results using the CAGE-seq dataset showed that mature tRNAs did not contain 3\u2032 polyAs. 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 sRNAs from all of the 13 mature tRNAs were represented by peaks in the genome-alignment maps. only a few 3\u2032 sRNAs of their upstream or downstream genes were represented by peaks. the genome-alignment results using the CAGE-seq dataset showed that U1, U2, and U4 snRNAs could be capped by 5\u2032 m7G or other caps. but U5, U6, and U7 snRNAs could at most be capped at a low level, if at all. mitochondrial genes were classified into tRNA, mRNA, rRNA, antisense tRNA (e.g., tRNASerAS), antisense mRNA (e.g., ND6AS), antisense rRNA and lncRNAs (e.g., MDL1 and MDL1AS). tRNA transcripts were tailed by 3\u2032 CCAs, while other mature transcripts were tailed by 3\u2032 polyAs mitochondrial mRNAs and rRNAs were capped by 5\u2032 m7G or other caps. tRNAGlnAS and MDL1 could at most be capped at a low level. qPCR of MDL1 provided higher sensitivities than that of BAX/BCL2 and CASP3 in the detection of cell apoptosis. mitochondrial tRNAs are annotated between two trimming sites of their mature RNAs, which misses the information of the cleavage sites. a novel ncRNA named non-coding mitochondrial RNA 1 was first discovered between tRNACys and tRNAAsn. annotated between two cleavage sites using the sRNA-seq based method. the acceptor stem of a tRNA precursor is trimmed to contain a 1-bp overhang at the 3\u2032 end. a polyA tail is post-transcriptionally added to the 3\u2032 end of ncMT1. tRNAAlaAS/tRNAAsnAS/tRNACysAS/tRNATyrAS, ND5/ND6AS/tRNAGluAS or MDL1 (tRNAProAS/D-loop), however, such events are not necessary for their biological functions. the enzymatic cleavage of COI/tRNASerAS was the most complicated in that the cleavage site contained an A-enriched region TCTAGACAAAA. the second TIS of the H-strand (ITH1) was determined to be at position 647 or 648 that was also the 5\u2032 end of 12S rRNA. this finding went against the long-standing claim that ITH2 was at position 638. tRF-1001 belongs to 5\u2032 sRNAs from lncTRS-TGA1-1, which is an antisense gene of HERC4. knockdown experiments using siRNA duplexes could result in the decrease in the expression of both lncTRS-TGA1-1 and HERC4. rRNAs and snRNAs were mainly degraded by 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 exonucleases to accumulate 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 sRNAs. peaks representing intronic sRNAs in rRNAs showed tissue specificities. plasma (SRA: SRP034590) exhibited specific peaks at positions 5,431, 9,891, and 11,158. the second most abundant reads AGGGCGAGGCT and TGTGCTGACCC formed a 15-bp duplex structure. 99.97% (49,889/49,903) of these duplexes were found from 14 samples of plasma. the duplex ratio of AGGGGCTTATC against TGTGCTGACCCCTGC was 2.15 (34,065/15,824). dsRNA cleavage to produce siRNA duplexes could induce RNAi due to the unbalanced duplex ratio of 2.15. if negative feed-back mechanism existed, expression level of U1 snRNA would decrease rather than remain stable once its over-expression surpassed a threshold. qPCR results showed relative expression levels of U1 in 12 groups. for each experiment, 12 groups of samples named control, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 were transfected by 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 L U1-packaged lentiviruses. the last criterion can be used to identify new steady RNAs. one example of a new steady RNA lncTRS-TGA1-1 and another example of two novel mitochondrial lncRNAs are introduced in the following paragraphs. we used 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 sRNAs from one sRNA-seq dataset to annotate genes. using only 5\u2032 sRNAs, gene annotation can be reduced to the identification of the 5\u2032 ends of mature RNAs. in doing so, the 3\u2032 ends of their upstream mature RNAs and their cleavage sites can be derived. for the 5\u2032 end of each mature RNA, we obtained two or three candidates. for the 5\u2032 end of each mature RNA, we corrected the annotation of human rRNA genes. the corrected annotations of human rRNA genes were validated using the CAGE-seq dataset and the GRO-seq dataset. the genome-alignment map using the CAGE-seq dataset showed that human rRNA genes had peaks at positions 3,657 and 7,926 corresponding to the 5\u2032 ends of 5.8S and 28S rRNA. this suggested that 18S and 28S rRNA could be capped by 5\u2032 m7G or other caps, but 5.8S rRNA could at most be capped at a low level, if at all. a novel class of sRNAs named tRNA-derived RNA fragments (tRF-5, tRF-3, and tRF-1) was introduced and three series of tRFs (tRF-5, tRF-3, and tRF-1) were identified using the sRNA-seq data of the human prostate cancer cell line. these authors did not achieve a full understanding of tRFs due to technological limitations and their small dataset size. 8,539 tRNAs (for Asp) and 16,900 TRE-CTC1-1 tRNAs (for Glu) were obtained. these results suggest that 3\u2032 sRNAs were produced by tRNA degradation during its synthesis. the genome-alignment results using the genome-alignment maps showed that mature tRNAs did not contain 3\u2032 polyAs. small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) include a class of small RNA molecules that are found within the splicing speckles and Cajal bodies of the cell nucleus in eukaryotic cells. snRNAs are always associated with a set of specific proteins and the complexes are called small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) tRNA transcripts were tailed by 3\u2032 CCAs, while other mature transcripts were tailed by 3\u2032 polyAs. the maximum length of the polyAs in tRNAGlnAS, ND2, tRNAMet, ND2, tRNATrp, tRNAAlaAS/tRNAAsnAS/tRNACysAS/tRNATyrAS, COI, tRNASerAS, ATP8/6, COIII tRNASerAS, COII, ATP8/6, COIII, ND3, ND4L/4, ND5/ND6AS/tRNAGluAS, Cytb, MDL1, 12S rRNA, 16S rRNA, and ND1 are 22, 13, 22, 17, 22, 24, 35, 22, 19, 22, 29, 25, 28, 32, 24, and 24, respectively. there was no significant difference in length distribution between polyAs in mRNAs and rRNAs. qPCR of MDL1 provided higher sensitivities than that of BAX/BCL2 and CASP3 in the detection of cell apoptosis. the annotation resolution of mitochondrial tRNAs is limited due to the complexity of tRNA processing. using 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 sRNAs, we annotated the mitochondrial tRNAs of human at 1 bp resolution. new annotations cover both entire strands of mitochondrial genomes. ncMT1 has a polyA tail as mitochondrial mRNAs and rRNAs. tRNATyr/tRNACys/tRNAAsn/tRNAAla is encoded by tRNAAsn. the enzymatic cleavage of COI/tRNASerAS was the most complicated in that the cleavage site contained an A-enriched region TCTAGACAAAAAA. 95.65% (23,000/24,045) of COI/tRNASerAS was not further cleaved, while only 0.19% (45/24,045) and 4.16% (1,000/24,045) of COI/tRNASerAS was not further cleaved ND5/ND6AS/tRNAGluAS was used as the template for the synthesis of proteins. this model was used to correct annotations of non-coding RNAs in human mitochondrial DNA. tRNAAlaAS-tRNATyrAS was not further cleaved for specific functions. we also found polyAs before the TISs, particularly GAG6A011 before ITH1. this finding explained why all of the TISs resided in A-enriched regions. however, further studies are necessary to support these explanations. analysis of RNA degradation using 5\u2032, 3\u2032 and intronic sRNAs. 5\u2032, 3\u2032 and 3\u2032 sRNAs were more abundant than intronic sRNAs. short 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 sRNAs were more abundant than longer ones for tRNAs, rRNAs and snRNAs. the most abundant reads AGGGCGAGGCT and TGTGCTGACCC formed a 15-bp duplex structure. the second most abundant reads AGGGCGAGGCT and TGTGCTGACCC formed a 15-bp duplex structure. we hypothesize that 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 exonucleases are more prevalent than endonucleases for the degradation of mature non-coding RNAs. longer mature RNAs have more and longer dsRNA regions (e.g., 15 bp long for stems in U1 snRNAs) than shorter ones (e.g., 7\u20139 bp as the longest for stems in tRNAs) to induce RNAi. the results in the HEK293 cell line showed a significant effect caused by the negative feed-back mechanism. RNAi could be involved in the RNA degradation and regulation of gene expression in U1 snRNA. RNAs lead to the discovery of new genes (e.g., MDL1 and MDL1AS), new biological functions and even new mechanisms. we hypothesize that 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 sRNAs performed biological functions. they are likely to have detrimental effects on the regulation of gene expression, as RNA degradation intermediates. discovery contradicts basic knowledge that Dicer is required for RNAi in mammal, producing siRNA duplexes with lengths of 20\u201325 bp. dsRNA cleavage and RNAi are housekeeping systems rather than immune defense systems. RNAi of one gene produces siRNA duplexes that regulate expression levels of itself or other genes. viruses containing greater number of such DNA complemented palindromes in their genomes have more chances to induce RNAi. the primary function of U1 snRNA is its involvement in the splicing of pre-mRNAs in nuclei. this inconsistent result can be explained by considering the function of RNAi in the RNA degradation of U1 snRNA. sRNAs of U1 snRNA were enriched in brain (SRA: SRP021924) but only a few of them were siRNA duplexes. we also provided a novel view on cancer and virus-induced diseases. human931 was built using 931 runs of human sRNA-seq data downloaded from the NCBI SRA database. 15, 14, 12, and 6 runs of sRNA-seq data in these four projects were produced using Illumina sequencing technologies with length 3546, 101, 101, and 101 bp. pLVX-shRNA1 plasmids and the Lenti-X HTX Packaging System were performed by virus transfection. each group contained 105 cells and virus titer was 107 TU/mL for 1X. each sample contained 105 cells. qPCR reaction mixture was incubated at 95\u00b0C for 30 s, followed by 40 PCR cycles (5 s at 95\u00b0C, 5 s at 60\u00b0C, and 10 s at 68\u00b0C for each cycle) qPCR reaction mixture was incubated at 95\u00b0C for 30 s, followed by 40 PCR cycles (5 s at 95\u00b0C, 5 s at 60\u00b0C, and 10 s at 68\u00b0C for each cycle) one perl script was used to transform Pileup files into 5-end files.
