{"summary": "GPEI launched the Immunization Systems Management Group in 2014. it consisted of members from the 5 core partners and the Vaccine Alliance. implementation of the endgame was a result of a successful collaboration among these large agencies with complex working structures and bureaucracies. 155 OPV-using countries and territories had discontinued use of type 2 OPV by switching from tOPV to bOPV in their national immunization programs. the switch included a complex milieu of activities, including cessation of tOPV production and shipment by manufacturers, detailed forecasting of tOPV needs, bOPV licensing, scaling up of bOPV production and procurement. the switch had to be synchronized in 155 countries and territories with varying levels of infrastructure, capacity, legislation, and manufacturer contracts. this unprecedented achievement was in no uncertain terms related to a strong collaborative partnership between national governments, United Nations agencies, supporting partners, donors, regulatory agencies, and manufacturers. withdrawn tOPV could still make its way back to the cold chain, possibly resulting in ongoing use of OPV2 and generation of VDPVs. destruction of unused vaccines largely has been an unchartered territory prior to the switch. a robust RI system also provides the foundation for controlling all childhood vaccine preventable diseases. Deutsch et al and Ongwae et al identify key factors behind success of polio eradication programs in the 10 high-risk priority countries. they provide specific examples of how these factors and experiences have been positively leveraged to broader immunization activities. polio infrastructure, workforce, and financial resources substantially contribute to immunization services beyond polio. the challenge is to effectively and responsibly transition polio resources, capacities, and experiences toward other global public health priorities. several articles highlight how the capacities and assets of the GPEI have been supporting other immunization and global health priorities. polio surveillance system serves as a platform for vaccine-preventable disease surveillance. the strengthening of RI systems deserves to have its own investment and attention. the countries are to be commended for introducing or committing to introduce at least 1 dose of IPV prior to the switch. the switch from tOPV to bOPV has been largely deemed a success. environmental and stool surveillance has identified sporadic detections of polioviruses, indicating some ongoing use of tOPV after the switch. countries were unlikely to have withdrawn every single vial, particularly from the private sector. the results of introducing IPV in nearly all countries in an accelerated manner in a compressed time frame of 3 years and successfully withdrawing OPV2 globally during April\u2013May 2016 support the view that the Immunization Systems Management Group succeeded in achieving the first phase of the polio endgame. many of the countries also dealt with serious civil or regional conflicts and outbreaks. immunization programs have a strong capacity to absorb and adapt to new global health initiatives in immunization. eradication justifies the effort put forth to provide the ultimate form of equity in health, both for those living today and for future generations to come."}
