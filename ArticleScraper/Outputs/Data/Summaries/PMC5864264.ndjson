{"summary": "the term \u201cBig Data\u201d originated before the turn of the millennium when in the 1990\u2019s when in the 1990\u2019s when in the forefront of computer graphics. at the time, SGI was struggling to deal with significantly expanding computational needs that outpaced available hardware. the term \u201cBig Data\u201d is now used to describe situations where data volumes are characterized by properties including, but not limited to: size, rate of change over time. the scale of genomics data in 2025 may be equivalent to 8 billion of the largest iPhones available today (128GB of space in 2015) or an iPhone\u2019s worth of data for every person on earth, each year. it is hard to fathom how large Big Data actually is. big data is being used to find meaning in a deluge of noise. the scale of text mining scientific manuscripts, news reports describing emergent issues and 140 character tweets truly is daunting when one considers that Twitter collects 12 billion tweets per day. the key for a meaningful Big Data strategy is the identification of the potential risk. the scale of text mining scientific manuscripts, news reports describing emergent issues and 140 character tweets truly is daunting. the key for a meaningful Big Data strategy to disease surveillance is the identification of the potential risk. unless we envision a computational Dark Ages it is hard to believe that Big Data will shrink. bespoke treatment of infectious diseases may soon be on our doorstep."}
