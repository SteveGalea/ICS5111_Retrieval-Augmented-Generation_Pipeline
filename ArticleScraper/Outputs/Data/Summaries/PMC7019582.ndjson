{"summary": "influenza viruses cause annual epidemics and produce 3\u20135 million cases of severe disease and 290,000 to 650,000 respiratory deaths annually. the case definition is a key factor in any standardized system of public health surveillance. the clinical characteristics of influenza, known as influenza-like illness, are similar to those caused by other viruses causing acute respiratory infection. the system should provide robust, continuous data in order to monitor the trends of clinically diagnosed ILI or ARI in the population studied. the accuracy of the clinical case definition has traditionally been assessed in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value. samples were sent to the core laboratory of the PIDIRAC surveillance system for determination of respiratory viruses (influenza viruses A\u2013C, syncytial respiratory virus, parainfluenza viruses 1\u20134, adenovirus, coronavirus, rhinovirus, metapneumovirus, and bocavirus) individuals whose clinical samples showed coinfection and those positive for influenza virus C were excluded. logistic regression models with the outcome of laboratory-confirmed influenza were constructed using backward selection. logistic regression models adjusted by age, sex, comorbidities, and season were constructed using backward selection. all of the data used in the analysis were fully anonymized. the samples were sent to the core laboratory of the PIDIRAC surveillance system for determination of respiratory viruses (influenza viruses A\u2013C, syncytial respiratory virus, parainfluenza viruses 1\u20134, adenovirus, coronavirus, rhinovirus, metapneumovirus, and bocavirus) individuals whose clinical samples showed coinfection and those positive for influenza virus C were excluded. analyses were carried out considering all influenza A and B viruses jointly and influenza A and influenza B viruses separately. logistic regression models with the outcome of laboratory-confirmed influenza were constructed using backward selection.
