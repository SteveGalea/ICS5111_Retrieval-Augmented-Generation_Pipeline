{"summary": "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) shocked the world by its high virulence and efficient transmissibility among humans. more than 8,000 patients were infected worldwide, resulting in 774 deaths. global economic loss due to SARS-CoV has been estimated to be 40 billion dollars (5). onavirus and MERS-CoV belong to lineages B and C Betacoronavirus. both are phylogenetically closely related to coronaviruses in bats (18-20) this article examines the clinical aspects of the novel human coronaviruses identified in the past ten years. reisolation of the virus and detection of specific immune response to the virus were fulfilled in studies conducted in cynomolgus macaques shortly after the discovery of the virus. the primary mode of transmission of SARS-CoV appeared to be by respiratory droplets (26) while fecal-oral transmission might also be (3). HCoV-HKU1 is associated with acute bronchiolitis and asthmatic exacerbation. the incidence of febrile seizure is higher in HCoV-HKU1 infection than infections caused by other human coronaviruses. most cases occurred during winter and spring coinciding with the influenza season (31-34) patients presented with fever, diarrhea and abdominal pain without respiratory symptoms. severe complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome, consumptive coagulopathy, and pericarditis. imported cases with occasional secondary spread to close contacts have been reported in the united kingdom, Germany, France, Italy and Tunisia. there is no specific antiviral for coronavirus infection approved for clinical use. many compounds have in vitro activity, but none has undergone randomized placebo controlled trials. no antiviral or immunomodulator, including convalescent plasma, was found to be efficacious. phylogenetic analysis of replicase gene of MERS-CoV showed that the virus was most closely related to bat CoV-HKU4 and CoV-HKU5 (14,15,57). at the time of writing, related coronaviruses have yet to be isolated from animals in the Middle East. most of the bat coronaviruses belong to Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus. bird coronaviruses belong to Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus. enteric coronaviruses have been identified in a camel previously (71) control measures should be implemented in hospitals for suspected human infections. patients with respiratory symptoms and history of travel to affected areas should be isolated and tested early to avoid nosocomial spread."}
