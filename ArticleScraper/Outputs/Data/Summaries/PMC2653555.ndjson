{"summary": "canine rabies has been successfully eliminated from western Europe and North America, but in the developing world, someone dies every ten minutes from this horrific disease. the unique pathology of rabies allowed us to trace case-to-case transmission directly, during a rabies outbreak in northern Tanzania. quantitative understanding of transmission dynamics of rabies in domestic dog populations, particularly the basic reproductive number, R0. rabies transmission dynamics are the most important process underlying infectious disease dynamics [13], but it is also the least understood. rabies is an acute viral encephalitis that is spread through the saliva of infected hosts. domestic dogs are the sole maintenance population of rabies in serengeti and Ngorongoro districts. they make up over 90% of our observations of rabid animals, and the >70 isolates that have been sequenced are consistent with the Africa 1b canid strain [18,19]. this is one of the most extensive datasets on individual transmission events assembled in an animal population; it has potential to shed light on critical, but often elusive details of infectious disease transmission. the probability that an unvaccinated dog developed rabies after being bitten by an infectious animal was high (P rabies|bite = 0.49, CI: 0.45\u20130.52) if the bitten dog was not vaccinated or killed immediately after exposure. rabid dogs were killed before biting other animals or that disappeared and likely corresponded to unknown or unobserved rabid dogs. this approach is robust to underreporting but should be considered a lower bound. we also estimated R0 from the intrinsic growth rate of outbreaks of domestic dog rabies elsewhere in the world. the inset shows the distribution of R0 estimates based on fitting to different regions of the time series. the effective reproductive number, R, (averaged over three-month intervals) was 1.1 and 1.3 for Serengeti and Ngorongoro. the mean estimates of R0 from fitting to these simulated trajectories were accurate. but they were surrounded by wide confidence intervals (Figures S2 and S5) suggesting that if only a small number of epidemics were sampled, any underlying relationship might not be apparent. the inset illustrates a village-level example of the susceptible reconstruction used to calculate instantaneous vaccination coverage plotted beside rabies cases. the distribution of secondary cases per infectious dog as inferred from reconstructed epidemic trees in Serengeti (blue) and Ngorongoro (red) districts plotted against vaccination coverage. we calculate the deterministic critical vaccination threshold for rabies elimination in rural Tanzania to be only 20% (P crit = 1 \u2013 1/R0), and even in areas where R0 is higher, P crit rises to just 40%. small outbreaks occur by chance even when coverage exceeds P crit and should be expected more frequently when there is individual variation in transmission. the probability that an unvaccinated dog developed rabies after being bitten by an infectious animal was high (P rabies|bite = 0.49, CI: 0.45\u20130.52) if the bitten dog was not vaccinated or killed immediately after exposure. the probability that an unvaccinated dog developed rabies was high (P rabies|bite = 0.49, CI: 0.45\u20130.52). i and 1.1 in Ngorongoro (CIs: 1.12\u20131.41 and 0.94\u20131.32, respectively) we also estimated R0 from the intrinsic growth rate of outbreaks of domestic dog rabies elsewhere in the world. we obtained values between 1.05 and 1.85, which are consistent with our estimates from northwest Tanzania. 0 estimates from the epidemic trajectories were relatively insensitive to the period used for fitting the exponential curve. the effective reproductive number, R, was measured from reconstructed epidemic trees that incorporate prior knowledge on who infected whom. dots indicate the number of secondary cases resulting from each primary case. the mean estimates of R0 from fitting to these simulated trajectories were accurate. but they were surrounded by wide confidence intervals (Figures S2 and S5) suggesting that if only a small number of epidemics were sampled, any underlying relationship might not be apparent. the inset illustrates a village-level example of the susceptible reconstruction used to calculate instantaneous vaccination coverage plotted beside rabies cases. the distribution of secondary cases per infectious dog as inferred from reconstructed epidemic trees in Serengeti (blue) and Ngorongoro (red) districts plotted against vaccination coverage. the deterministic critical vaccination threshold for rabies elimination in rural Tanzania to be only 20% (P crit = 1 \u2013 1/R0), and even in areas where R0 is higher, P crit rises to just 40% (Table 2). our observations and simulations show that small outbreaks occur by chance even when coverage exceeds P crit. most methods do not account for variability in the pathogenesis and behaviour of infected animals. some methods make inferences from quantities confounded by (often unmeasured) responses to disease incidence. some methods make inferences from quantities that are confounded by disease incidence. turnover of domestic dogs in rural Tanzania is very high. annual campaigns should aim to vaccinate 60% of the dog population. domestic dog population turnover therefore appears to have had a marked influence on rabies dynamics that explain the variable success of vaccination efforts. the problem of canine rabies has often been considered intractable in rural Africa, because of poor infrastructure, limited capacity, and misperception that large populations of wild carnivores are responsible for disease persistence. successful elimination of canine rabies in many parts of the world has likely been achieved precisely because R0 is so low and institutional commitment to maintain high levels of vaccination coverage has been sustained. attributes of the dog populations in these districts are presented in Table 3. domestic dogs are the focus of this study because they are the only maintenance population of rabies in the area. a high percentage of samples from suspected cases of rabies were confirmed by laboratory diagnosis. a high percentage of samples from suspected cases of rabies were confirmed by laboratory diagnosis. a high percentage of samples from suspected cases were confirmed by laboratory diagnosis. the spatial infection kernel K(d) was estimated by fitting a gamma distribution to the distances between known source cases and animals that they contacted. we replaced the probability of a contact within 100 m by the probability distribution averaged over the range 0\u2013100 m. dogs that were bitten by rabid animals but did not develop rabies because of interventions were multiplied by P rabies|bite and added to observed secondary cases. we also estimated R0 directly from the distribution of secondary cases per rabid dog in the absence of intervention. a single infection will cause future cases distributed according to probability distribution of the generation interval. a single infection will cause future cases distributed according to the probability distribution of the generation interval. a single infection will cause future cases distributed according to the probability distribution of the generation interval. the estimate of R0 was robust to the interval chosen for fitting the curve. for these time series, we fitted exponential curves to the intervals between the first recorded case and the month (or week) with highest rabies incidence. for partly vaccinated populations, we corrected our R0 estimates by dividing by the fraction of dogs which were vaccinated prior to the outbreak. domestic dog demography was necessary to calculate vaccination coverage and the decline in herd immunity due to population turnover and waning of vaccine-induced immunity. we calculated human:dog ratios from household questionnaires conducted in 1994, 2003, and 2008 in Serengeti district and in 1994 and 2004 in Ngorongoro district. r dogs (0.088 dogs/y) was similar to other estimates from the region [41,42] and close to those calculated directly from population sizes (r Serengeti = 0.090 dogs/y, r Ngorongoro = 0.102 dogs/y) to predict the expected size of outbreaks given the observed variability in transmission. each realization was seeded by a single animal. the starting population was initialized with vaccination coverage generated from a binomial distribution. we calculated the probability of an outbreak of a particular size or larger being seeded by one infectious case to evaluate the coverage needed to prevent outbreaks with different degrees of certainty. data collected from two districts in northwest Tanzania. serengeti, inhabited by multi-ethnic, agro-pastoralist communities and high-density dog populations, and Ngorongoro, a multiple-use controlled wildlife area. a high percentage of samples from suspected cases of rabies were confirmed by laboratory diagnosis. despite efforts to obtain diagnostic samples, most cases reported here were suspected rather than confirmed. a high percentage of samples from suspected cases were confirmed by laboratory diagnosis. the spatial infection kernel K(d) was estimated by fitting a gamma distribution to the distances between known source cases and animals that they contacted. the probability of developing rabies following a bite (P rabies|bite) was estimated, excluding bitten animals that had previously been vaccinated, or that were either killed or vaccinated immediately after the bite. insufficient complete case-histories of rabid dogs were traced to accurately estimate R0 for Ngorongoro (35 versus 477 in Serengeti) we also estimated R0 directly from the distribution of secondary cases per rabid dog. for each suspected case (i), we chose a progenitor (j) at random with probability pij from all n cases preceding that case. all detected cases in carnivores (including domestic cat and wildlife cases) were included in the tree reconstructions using the spatial infection kernel and generation interval parameters estimated for domestic dogs. the contribution of nondomestic dog carnivores to the overall epidemic was small. ike's information Criterion values to determine the appropriate error structure (Poisson or negative binomial) the model was fit to all possible sections of the epidemic curve (using a minimum of nine consecutive months) and the median, the 2.5th and the 97.5th percentile of the R0 estimates are presented in Table 1. s of secondary cases per rabid dog (inferred from the epidemic tree reconstructions) were calculated monthly and averaged across bootstrapped trees to give a time-varying estimate of R. domestic dog demography was necessary to calculate vaccination coverage and the decline in herd immunity due to population turnover and waning of vaccine-induced immunity. we suspect that mortality of female puppies is greater than males. but obtaining reliable data to accurately estimate pup survival is difficult. this estimate of r dogs (0.088 dogs/y) was similar to other estimates from the region. to predict the expected size of outbreaks, we simulated outbreaks in a starting population of 500 dogs (similar to the domestic dog population size in an average village); this choice had little effect on our results. each realization was seeded by a single animal and the starting population was initialized with vaccination coverage generated from a binomial distribution. vaccine-induced immunity is likely to be closer to a fixed duration. fewer dogs would be expected to lose immunity during the 1-y interval between campaigns. this indicates that our estimate of P target may be slightly overestimated. the median estimated value of R0 (from 1,000 simulated, sampled epidemics) is indicated by the solid black line. the interquartile range and 95 percentiles of R0 estimates are shaded in dark and light gray. the range of R0 estimates from simulations spans the range of estimates from compiled outbreak data from around the world. considerably more variance in estimates was generated from negative binomial biting behaviour than from Poisson biting. incubating animals appear as black dots, which turn red when clinical signs start. when a rabid animal bites another animal that will subsequently develop rabies a black line connects the two individuals. the video is on a weekly timescale."}
