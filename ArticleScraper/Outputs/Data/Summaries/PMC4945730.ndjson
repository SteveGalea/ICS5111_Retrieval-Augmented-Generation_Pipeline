{"summary": "the suspected transmission route for human MERS-CoV infection was a direct contact with the saliva of infected camels. the seroprevalence of MERS-CoV was several times higher in persons with regular exposure to camels than in the general population. the incapability of MERS-CoV to infect animal models indicates the presence of a species barrier. a few early super-spreading events fueled the MERS outbreak in Republic of Korea. these cases were termed as \"super-spreaders,\" while the vast majority of cases induced relatively few secondary infections. some non-super-spreaders had similar conditions to those favoring super-spreading events. some non-super-spreaders had similar conditions to those favoring super-spreading events. despite this, no confirmed secondary cases were found amongst thousands. the lowest risk group (age 60 years without any underlying diseases) is 13.6 % for those aged 60 years or older, without any underlying diseases. underlying diseases resulted in a 7.8-fold higher likelihood of fatality. enhanced hospital infection control practices were very important to reduce associated mortality. a number of cases could not be suspected in the first hospital visit. a higher index of alerting system to find the source-patient earlier is needed. the CDC recommends that the AIIRs be single, negative pressure, patient rooms. a total of 119 negative pressure beds were prepared before the MERS outbreak. the resultant shortage of AIIRs meant that not all MERS suspected patients were isolated at the peak of the outbreak. many public hospitals had to recruit medical personnel from university and army hospitals. a higher index of alerting system to find the source-patient earlier could not be suspected in the first hospital visit, as early clinical manifestations of MERS are non-specific. a number of cases could not be suspected in the first hospital visit, as early clinical manifestations of MERS are non-specific. a higher index of alerting system to find the source-patient earlier could not be suspected in the first hospital visit. CDC recommends that the AIIRs be single, negative pressure, patient rooms. a direct discharge of air from these rooms to the outside, or filtration through a high-efficiency particulate air filter before recirculation. the resultant shortage of AIIRs meant not all MERS suspected patients were isolated. the number of infectious diseases specialists was less than 200 for the 50 million people at the time of the 2015 MERS outbreak. this resulted in overworked healthcare professionals, which could be a threat for both the healthcare workers and the patients [23]. public hospitals for critical care of severe infections and pre-emptive isolation for unknown acute respiratory infection. these strategies are crucial to prepare for a future MERS-like epidemic in Korea."}
