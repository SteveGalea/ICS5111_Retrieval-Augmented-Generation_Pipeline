{"summary": "rRNA synthesis by Pol I accounts for 35- 60% of all nuclear transcription. rRNA represents nearly 80% of the steady-state cellular RNA content. in growing mammalian cells, rRNA synthesis by Pol I accounts for 35- 60% of all nuclear transcription. only 30% of nucleolar proteins are involved in ribosome biogenesis. the nucleolus indirectly, through sequestration and release of these proteins, has the ability to modulate a diverse range of cellular functions. the nucleolus is at the centre of coordinating rDNA transcription, ribosome subunit biogenesis, cell cycle progression and cellular stress responses. rDNA copies appear to play an essential role in maintaining the genetic stability of the rDNA repeats. this review provides an overview of the mechanisms that regulate rDNA transcription. we discuss the spatial organization of the nucleoli around actively transcribed rDNA and their potential functional interactions with the rest of the genome. the resultant UBF/SL-1 complex facilitates recruitment of an initiation-competent subpopulation of Pol I to form a productive PIC at the rDNA promoters [8,68-72]. despite the high demand for rRNA synthesis, only a subset of rRNA genes is transcribed at any given time. the first two states are defined as open/accessible chromatin structures. rRNA genes are required for efficient DNA recombination repair. nucleoli disassemble at the onset of mitosis coinciding with inactivation of Pol I transcription. cell cycle mediated regulation of rDNA transcription is facilitated by post-translational modifications of components of the Pol I transcription machinery. the majority of the 47S precursor rRNA is thought to be synthesized at the boundary between the FC and the DFC. the late steps of rRNA processing and assembly of the small (40S) and large (60S) ribosome subunits take place in the GCs [21,24] over 4500 proteins reside within human nucleoli and through the control of their sequestration and release. nucleolar integrity is tightly linked to rRNA gene transcription and ribosome biogenesis. downregulation of pol I transcription seems to be a major strategy to maintain cellular homeostasis under adverse growth conditions or metabolic deficits. ribosome biogenesis is now thought to function as a highly sensitive cellular sensor of stress. p53 independent checkpoints are activated in response to inactivation of Pol I transcription. the ribosome biogenesis rate through the nucleolar stress pathway ensures a coordinated response to a variety of proliferative and stress stimuli. the structure of the genome is highly dynamic and is closely coupled with gene regulation. chromosome 1 and 9 chromosomes and chromosome Y heterochromatin. a large tract of a satellite repeat family is specific to the acrocentric chromosomes. the region flanking the rDNA on the telomeric side contains a large tract of a satellite repeat family. there is no enrichment of these elements in the regions immediately flanking the rDNA arrays even though they show perinucleolar localization. a third class of potential nucleolus-tethering factors is long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) rDNA instability has been observed in patients harbouring a mutation in the DNA helicase BLM gene leading to dysregulated homologous recombination (HR) rDNA instability can also be detected in cells deficient for ataxia-telangiectasia (ATM), the primary sensor of DNA double stranded breaks. anti-recombinatoric regulators such as Srs2 are found in close proximity to the rDNA [161], suggesting a strong correlation between rDNA copy number and genome integrity [152,162]. rDNA instability-dependent aging is proposed to induce senescence and prevent global genome instability [162,163]. studies in yeast led to the suggestion that silent copies of rDNA can sequester mediators of the DNA damage repair pathway. variations in rDNA copy number may influence cellular responses to DNA damage. rDNA repeats are crucial players in the maintenance of genome stability. rDNA transcription is deregulated in cancers by oncogene activation and/or tumor suppressor inactivation. this has been previously explained in terms of an increased demand for ribosomes in highly proliferative cells. this therapeutic benefit is due to tumour-specific induction of the nucleolar stress pathway leading to activation of p53. ribosomopathies and cohesinopathies are unique but collectively exhibit overlapping symptoms including craniofacial abnormalities and growth retardation. downregulation of rDNA transcription has been proposed to determine cell fate and to act as a trigger for cellular differentiation. increased genomic content of the 18S rDNA region and an increase in rDNA silencing have been detected in the parietal cortex of Alzheimer\u2019s disease patients. the evolving paradigm of the nucleolus being a key regulator of cellular homeostasis implicates nucleolar stress resulting from deregulation of rDNA transcription. in mammalian cells, rDNA chromatin can exist in at least four distinct states. the first two states are defined as open/accessible chromatin structures. the first two states are defined as open/accessible chromatin structures. structure of nucleoli is highly dynamic and tightly coordinated with cell cycle progression. nucleoli disassemble at the onset of mitosis coinciding with inactivation of Pol I transcription. rate of rRNA gene transcription reaches a maximum in S- and G2 phases, is halted at the onset of mitosis and slowly reactivated as cell enter G1. the majority of the 47S precursor rRNA is thought to be synthesized at the boundary between the FC and the DFC. the late steps of rRNA processing and assembly of the small (40S) and large (60S) ribosome subunits take

can also be detected in cells deficient for ataxia-telangiectasia (ATM), the primary sensor of DNA double stranded breaks. neurodegeneration also appears to be associated with instability of rDNA [156], including Alzheimer\u2019s disease [157]. studies in yeast suggest a strong correlation between rDNA copy number and genome integrity [152,162] rDNA instability-dependent aging is proposed to

number may influence cellular responses to DNA damage. rDNA repeats have a great impact on cellular processes, including heterochromatin structure and function, global gene expression and DNA damage response. these processes can then, in turn, promote aging, cancer and disease. pol I activity is often deregulated in cancers by oncogene activation and/or tumor suppressor inactivation. this has been previously explained in terms of an increased demand for ribosomes in highly proliferative cells. this therapeutic benefit is due to tumour-specific induction of the nucleolar stress pathway leading to activation of p53 and cell death by apoptosis. ribosomopathies and cohesinopathies are unique but collectively exhibit overlapping symptoms including craniofacial abnormalities and growth retardation. rRNA gene transcription and disruption of nucleolar integrity and function are associated with the pathogenesis of age-related neurological disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease [157], Huntington\u2019s diseases [183,184], Parkinson disease [185] and spinocerebellar ataxias [186]. an increase in rDNA silencing has been detected in the parietal cortex of Alzheimer\u2019s disease patients. the evolving paradigm of the nucleolus being a key regulator of cellular homeostasis implicates nucleolar stress resulting from deregulation of rDNA transcription in the development of these diseases. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors\u2019 contributions JD and ES contributed equally to writing this review.
