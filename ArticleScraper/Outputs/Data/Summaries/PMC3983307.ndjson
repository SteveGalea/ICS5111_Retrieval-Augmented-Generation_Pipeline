{"summary": "three genera, Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, and Gammacoronavirus, were proposed to replace the traditional group 1, 2, and 3 coronaviruses (1\u20133). the fourth genus, Deltacoronavirus, has recently been described by a research group in Hong Kong (4, 5) genome sequences of PDCoV in u.s. swine have not been previously reported. genome of PDCoV USA/IA/2014/8734 has 271 nt differences. majority of nt differences were located in the ORF1a/1b and S genes. the PDCoV sequence data will facilitate future research on the epidemiology and evolutionary biology of PDCoVs in U.S. swine. further study remains to be conducted to determine the clinical significance of PDCoV."}
