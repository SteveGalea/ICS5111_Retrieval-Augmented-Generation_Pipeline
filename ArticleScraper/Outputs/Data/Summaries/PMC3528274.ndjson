{"summary": "bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) has been recognized as a pathogen in cattle since the early 1970s. impact of BRSV infection on the cattle industry results in economic losses due to morbidity, mortality, treatment and prevention costs. BRSV virion consists of a lipid envelope containing three surface glycoproteins (glycoprotein [G], the fusion protein [F] and the small hydrophobic protein [SH]) epidemiology of BRSV BRSV is widely spread around the world, most likely as a direct result of the movement of cattle. infectivity rates are usually rather high, suggesting that viral transmission is a common event among herds. BRSV outbreaks commonly occur during winter [11]. the distribution of BRSV is most likely affected by the movement of cattle, as insect vectors are not believed to play a role in viral transmission. BRSV infection is also associated with a high morbidity of up to 80% and with mortality that can reach up to 20% in some outbreaks. clinically ill animals are believed to be the most likely sources of infection. reintroduction of the virus into the herd before the occurrence of a new outbreak. prevalence of the disease varies greatly in north America. in canada, initial reports have shown that the overall frequency of BRSV infection might be nearly 36%. however, during outbreaks, the percentage of sero-positive individuals within a herd can range between 22% and 53%. BRSV is still an important cause of mortality among cattle in Canada [34] a high prevalence of BRSV infection has also been reported in Belgium. a high sero-prevalence of BRSV has also been reported in northern Europe. a high sero-prevalence of BRSV has also been reported in northern Europe. recent advances in phylogenetics have allowed for the analysis in greater detail of sequence information. current phylogenetic methods facilitate the estimation of the time to the origin of a new viral strain, of the emergence of new species, identification of viral recombination, of population size, and of how the virus spread and evolve in particular settings. phylogentic analysis have also helped to identify the presence of mutations mapping along the immunodominat region located on the G protein. study of molecular epidemiology of BRSV began with identification of nucleotide sequences of the glycoprotein (G), fusion (F), nucleocapsid (N), matrix (M), phosphoprotein (P), small hydrophobic (SH) and M2 proteins. initial assessment of homology along the P protein between two isolates showed an identity of 97% at the nucleotide level [67], suggesting only one single genetic group. monoclonal antibodies against the BRSV G, F, N, and P proteins showed random antigenic differences among the isolates. cross-reactivity to the viral protein epitopes was observed, particularly with the F protein. however, structural differences along the P protein were not correlated with the antigenic differences observed in the F and N proteins. isolates of Danish origin formed three distinct lines within a separate cluster. these isolates were closely related to the 220-69Bel strain, the prototype strain of the intermediate antigenic group. a recent comparative analysis between Swedish and Danish isolates showed that the reduced sequence diversity among Swedish strains might be due to the relatively closed cattle population in Sweden. only five phylogenetic groups were observed for either protein (Figure 2B and 2C) the characteristic clustering of BRSV sequences was observed according to geographical origin and date of isolation. the study identified vaccine failure among animals harboring infections with BRSV groups V and VI. phylogenetic trees from each BRSV genotype were generated using representative strains from each BRSV genotype [50] Clonal analysis revealed the nucleotide heterogeneity along the G-coding region. findings suggest that BRSV populations evolve as complex mutant swarms. the global molecular epidemiology of BRSV has remained elusive. only sparse reports addressing the distribution of BRSV groups are available in the literature. a study conducted in the early 2000s reported the circulation of strains belonging to subgroup III. the advent of next-generation sequencing platforms could provide a unique opportunity for the discovery of the underlying processes responsible for viral replication and survival in the host. BRSV has been recognized as an important cause of respiratory disease in cattle for nearly four decades."}
