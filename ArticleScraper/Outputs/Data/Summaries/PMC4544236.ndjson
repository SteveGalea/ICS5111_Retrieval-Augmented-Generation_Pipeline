{"summary": "international development assistance for health quadrupled between 1990 and 2012, from US$ 5.6 billion to US$ 28.1 billion. this generates an increasing need for transparent and replicable tools that could be used to set investment priorities, monitor the distribution of funding in real time. PLANET is based on a combination of two useful procedures. it reduces the multi-dimensional space of a complex system to a smaller number of core variables that capture most of the variation. by defining a set of 15 \u201ccriteria\u201d the process effectively reduces a notoriously complex and multi\u2013dimensional task. iii) decentralization (people are able to specialize and draw on local knowledge); and (iv) aggregation (some mechanism exists for turning private judgments into a collective decision \u2013 in this case, the PLANET method) iv) aggregation (some mechanism exists for turning private judgments into a collective decision \u2013 in this case, the PLANET method) based on the collective knowledge of the persons most closely informed about each step in the process, how likely it is to complete its mission, and how vulnerable it is to retarding forces. the first function is labeled \u2018providing\u2019 and is concerned with the need to raise or generate funds (the funders of DAH) to improve global health through development. the second function is \u2018managing\u2019 and is concerned with the management or pooling of those funds. an unprecedented amount of money is being pledged and used to fund health services across the world. but several studies have shown that funding does not correspond closely to burden. the reason for this misalignment could be due to the social construction of the problem [17], lobbying by vested interests [18] or the personal interests of donors [19]. a variety of well-funded and well-meaning initiatives descend with good intentions on countries in the developing world. donors could invest in new players and models rather than strengthening and building on existing institutional infrastructure. the risk that development partners will fail to coordinate their activities for a specific project needs to be established. the risk that a development project will be designed in a way that results in too much funding going to costly organizations needs to be established. managers are often torn between global priorities, specifically the priorities of donors, and being accountable to local communities and the ultimate recipients of aid. managers could deliberately steal resources from the investment for their own benefit, ie, the risk of corruption. most information about cost\u2013effectiveness are available at the regional level. managers could route funding through non\u2013governmental organizations or private sector bodies rather than working through governments. this creates challenges when applying these estimates to country and district level projects. is the amount of financial investment disproportional to the size of the problem(s) being addressed\" is the amount of financial investment disproportional to the size of the problem(s) being addressed\" is the investment likely to spend too much of its total budget on costly \u2018middle men\u2019 organizations\" the investment being reduced due to poor evidence to support decisions. was the desired effect of the investment reduced through corruption and stealing of resources. was the desired effect reduced due to unnecessary exclusion of local expertise. the third level of stakeholders includes all those involved in the final stage of DAH of reaching the recipients. the primary recipient could deliberately steal funding or commodities from this process for his/her own benefit. despite consensus that the project should be funded horizontally, most financing is channeled vertically (defined as setting up separate systems to deliver on the objectives often related to specific diseases) the choice of a DAH priority directly affects recipients\u2019 health, meaning that these individuals should also have the right to participate in deciding on the priorities and implementation of the project. the risk that the project will not be aligned with local priorities or promote community involvement needs to be assessed. the project could be seen as unethical, inequitable or unacceptable to the final recipients. a PLANET exercise will look at other equally important dimensions that would impact on the success of the project in reducing burden of disease. the results would be a comprehensive list of the strengths and weaknesses of particular projects against many criteria, based on the collective input of technical experts. donors would need to define the context of the exercise based on their anticipated outcomes, the population they are targeting, the time\u2013frame they are working under. a comprehensive list of competing priorities ranked according to the combined scores they received in the process. the list can also be adjusted by taking the values of many stakeholders into account. the list can also be adjusted by taking the values of many stakeholders into account. the PLANET questionnaire is currently being developed into an app that would be freely available to all governments, international institutions and individuals looking for a simple, tech-friendly tool. it presents a standardized methodology that can be used for planning, monitoring and evaluation of any type of DAH project. it also has sufficient flexibility to be tailored to the context of specific projects or initiatives."}
