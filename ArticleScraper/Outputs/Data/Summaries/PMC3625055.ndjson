{"summary": "all animal procedures were approved by the Harlan Laboratories IACUC. rats were housed according to standards in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. rats originated from a colony free of rat parvoviruses. 74 male and 58 female rats were selected randomly and euthanized by carbon dioxide inhalation. blood was collected by cardiocentesis and serum prepared and refrigerated. samples placed in 10% buffered formalin and then in 70% ethanol. RNA levels depicted in Figure 1 were measured in triplicate from total RNA isolated by TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) extraction and isopropanol\u2013ethanol precipitation. total RNA underwent reverse transcription by using high-capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit with RNase Inhibitor (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA) and thermal cycling. pleen iron levels, and RNA levels of liver hepcidin relative to -actin levels were measured in 58 female (dark gray) and 74 male (light gray) rats. circles indicate outlier values. p values between female and male data sets were calculated by using Student t tests. 96 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and 9 simple sequence length polymorphisms (SSLP; Table 1) were used for typing the Hsd:HHCL population. SNP genotypes were determined by using TaqMan (ABI) chemistry. 82 SNP2783623\u2013SNP 1 80, 640, 569 R2783669\u2013Chr1 2 12, 363, 339 SNP2785272\u2013SNP 2 14, 167, 043 SNP2785285\u2013SNP 2 15, 053, 536 SNP2785289\u2013SNP 2 23, 840, 536 SNP2785285\u2013SNP 2 33, 524, 941 SNP2785456\u2013SNP 2 37, 559 R2791731\u2013Chr5 6 1, 954, 289 SNP2791870\u2013SNP 6 7, 893, 672 SNP2791917\u2013SNP 6 46, 447, 474 SNP2792137\u2013SNP 6 48, 598, 961 R2792166\u2013Chr6 6 49, 185, 615 SNP2792170\u2013SNP 6 55, 888, 289 R2792230\u2013Chr6 6 71, 260, 3 37, 809\u2013115, 338, 082 D8Rat11 9 10, 646, 165 R2795347\u2013Chr9 9 13, 988, 198 SNP2795390\u2013SNP 9 24, 414, 293 SNP2795465\u2013SNP 9 47, 745, 902 SNP2795595\u2013SNP 10 8, 131, 820 SNP2796134\u2013SNP 10 11, 765, 336 SNP27962173\u2013SNP pExpress-1 vector carrying wild-type rat Tfr2 cDNA was obtained from Source BioScience (Nottingham, UK) intact coding sequence was confirmed by sequencing. pExpress-1 vector carrying wild-type rat Tfr2 cDNA was obtained from Source BioScience. r2 and -actin protein levels in cells lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) were measured as described above. basic statistical analysis was performed by using Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) and Student 2-tailed t tests with unequal variance. the procedure is appropriate for an outbred rat population like Hsd:HHCL. no diversity assumptions are used to evaluate statistical significance. the power of this approach is due in part to the limited diversity of the colony and the prolonged duration of haplotypes within it. temperature was 72 4 \u00b0F (23.3 2.2 \u00b0C) and humidity was 50% 30%. 74 male and 58 female rats were selected randomly and euthanized by carbon dioxide inhalation. 679G polymorphism, A679/A679 (homozygous AA at amino acid 679), A679/G679 (heterozygous AG) and G679/G679 (homozygous GG) rats were selected and interbred to generate 9 to 13 male and female rats of each genotype. characterization of samples from progeny was performed in similar manner as for the characterization of the larger population. 6 were 5\u2032 GGC TGA AGT CTC CGC TC 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 CGG GCT CCA GCT CCT CC 3\u2032. immunoblotting was performed by using rabbit antimouse Tfr2 (Alpha Diagnostics International, San Antonio, TX) as previously described. unaffected male rats are defined as those rats with liver iron levels less than 1.5 SD above or below the mean for all male rats. a total of 96 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and 9 simple sequence-length polymorphisms were used for typing the Hsd:HHCL population.

A679G polymorphisms reside in the cytoplasmic, protease-like, and helical domains, respectively, of Tfr2. all of the rats in the tested population were homozygous for the K10R and R180S alleles. but the A679G allele segregated as a minor allele in the population. NP_001012080.1 and NP_001099386.1; Homo sapiens (H.sap), Q8N7M5.1 and NP_003218.2; Mus musculus (M.mus) NP_081402.3 and NP_056614.3; Canis familaris (C.fam), XP_546952.2; Oryctolagus cuniculus (O.cun), XP_ s affected by Tfr2 hemochromatosis mutations Q690P, R752H, and G792R are indicated as white space-filling side chains. the helical domain is shown as part of the larger extracellular Tfr2 fragment consisting of helical, apical, and protease-like domains. to gauge the potential effect of the A679G polymorphism on Tfr2 structure and function, we mapped the the neogenin locus at 108.20 to 108.24 Mb had a lower logarithm-of-odds score than did the SSLP at 88 Mb, suggesting that the gene of interest lay distal to the 88 Mb SSLP. repeating the QTL mapping analysis by using the Tfr2 A679G polymorphism as a covariate rendered the chromosome 8 locus nonsignificant. the entire rat genome (approximately 2.6 Gb total) is represented along the x axis from chromosome 1 (left end of axis) to 20 (right end of axis) regions of the genome corresponding to individual chromosomes are indicated as alternate white and gray shading. rat 2 is the affected male rat of interest and is indicated by arrows in Figure 1 and characterized in Figure 2. Figure 5. Characterization of iron homeostasis in rat population according to the A679G genotype. expression levels of the G679 variant were significantly decreased relative to that of the A679 variant. hek293T and HepG2 cells were transfected with cDNA expression vectors encoding the Ala679 (Ala) or Gly679 (Gly) Tfr2 variant. protein levels of Tfr2 and -actin then were measured by immunoblotting and densitometry. rats carrying the A679G allele were bred to generate 9 to 13 male and female rats of the homozygous AA, heterozygous liver nonheme iron levels and ratios of liver:spleen nonheme iron were significantly higher in female and male GG than in AG or GG rats. levels decreased (P 0.05) or trended toward decreasing in female rats carrying 1 or 2 G679 alleles. spleen iron levels in male rats did not vary greatly. the current study is the first to identify a mutation in a hemochromatosis gene in rats. mouse models of hemochromatosis do not always recapitulate characteristics of the human disease, such as hepatic fibrosis. the rat model may more closely mimic the human disease than do current mouse models. sex may reflect that fact that colony is not inbred and that other alleles exist within the population that modify the hemochromatosis phenotype. whereas liver Bmp6 RNA levels were increased in female homozygous rats, hepcidin levels were not increased, suggesting that Bmp6 levels may not be stimulated adequately by iron overload in these rats."}
