{"summary": "about 60\u201380% of these emerging infections originate from wildlife including bats. some bats have been implicated as a major reservoir of pathogenic zoonotic viruses. some bats (Order Chiroptera) have been implicated as a major reservoir of pathogenic zoonotic viruses. fecal samples from two species of fruit bats (Eidolon helvum and Epomophorus gambianus) were collected from three localities of the south west region of cameroon. the gut virome typically contains both eukaryotic and prokaryotic viruses (phages), of which the latter usually represents the largest fraction of the gut virome in animals. 108 million reads, 14% could be assigned as viral while 86% was non-viral (bacterial, host, or dark matter) most of the viral reads were assigned as phages (89%) and about 11% were eukaryotic viruses. most of the viral reads were assigned as phages. we analyzed the remaining viral sequences belonging to double-stranded RNA (families Reoviridae, Picobirnaviridae, and Partitiviridae), single-stranded RNA (families Astroviridae and Coronaviridae) and single-stranded DNA (families Parvoviridae and Circoviridae) viral groups. the size of the pie is proportional to the amount of samples analyzed at each Lysoka 7,882,440 1,548,502 624,087 76,032 700,119 45.21 848,383 P4 3 F Adult Lysoka 9,608,680 4,786,763 639,351 41,507 680,858 14.22 4,105,905 P5 3 M Adult Moyuka 7,898,316 2,115,775 694,518 936 695,454 32.87 1,420,321 P6 be 17,437,336 7,587,472 7,534 106,990 114,524 1.51 7,472,948 P16b 2 F Adult Lysoka 8,040,290 3,252,902 466,407 105,950 572,357 17.60 2,680,545 P17 3 F Adult Lysoka 11,702,558 8,950,127 1,649,086 153,810 1,802,896 20.14 7,147,2 eukaryotic viral families in feces from all 25 bat pools in relation to different parameters. low abundant mammalian viruses not in this figure are: Astroviridae, Circoviridae, Hepeviridae, Herpesviridae, Paramyxoviridae, and Papillomaviridae. we identified RVH reads in two different bat pools, including one near complete genome. the eleven bat RVH segments recovered were distantly related to those of human and porcine RVH strains. the eleven bat RVH gene segments were more or less equally distantly related to those of human and porcine RVH strains. s in humans and less clearly in pigs as most known infections occur in co-infections with other RV species such as RVA, RVB, and RVC. if RVH causes diseases in bats is currently unknown. PBVs are currently classified into two genogroups (Smits et al. 2011; Malik et al. 2014); and recently, a large number of novel PBV-like sequences from insects have been described. a large number of novel PBV-like sequences from insects have been described. only for the cameroonian strain P16-366, a capsid sequence could be identified in our metagenomics data. we used a custom build database containing all known capsid genes and used HMMER to search the sequencing pools in which we found the PBV. however, no capsid sequences could be identified. Graphs represent separation of groups using the most influential factors. the identification of these PBV-like RdRp sequences without an apparent capsid is reminiscent to that of mitoviruses. the cameroonian strain P16-366 clustered more closely with mitochondrial genomes. most of the PBVs using a standard genetic code clustered away from sequences using alternative genetic codes. the larger genome segment codes for the RdRp while the smaller segment encodes one coat protein(s) partitiviruses are known to infect plants, fungi and an apicomplexan protist of the genus Cryptosporidium. they are classified into five genera based on phylogenetic analysis. only eight of the strains fall within these established genera. RVs belong to the family Reoviridae and the genus RV consists of nine species, A to I (Attoui et al. 2012; Mihalov-Kov\u00e1cs et al. 2015). RVAs are most common of all the species having a wide host range including humans. the current identification of RVH in bats further expands its host range. it has been clearly associated with gastroenteritis in humans and less clearly in pigs. most known infections occur in co-infections with other RV species. the smaller segment (1.2\u20131.9 kb) encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) PBVs have been identified in feces of several mammals, birds, and invertebrates. a large number of novel PBV-like sequences from insects have been described. three of the novel bat strains, P11-378, P14-90, and P15-218 share >98% aa identity and clustered with beihai picobirna-like Virus 4, 5, and 6 identified in hermit crabs in china. the distant phylogenetic clustering suggest either these viruses are true crustacean viruses (instead of bat infecting viruses), or (more likely) that there is a lack of available sequence data of this virus from other potential host tree was midpoint rooted for purposes of clarity. only bootstrap values >70% are shown except at branches and clusters. bars indicate amino acid substitutions per site. s could be infecting the mitochondrion, we performed a principle component analysis (PCA) of the codon usage bias of different known mitochondrial genome sequences, mitoviruses, classical PBVs and PBV-like viruses using an alternative genetic code. most of the PBVs using a standard genetic code, clustered away from sequences using the alternative genetic codes. titi-like viruses are viruses of the family Partitiviridae. the larger genome segment (dsRNA1) codes for the RdRp. the smaller segment (dsRNA2) encodes one coat protein(s) es of the deltapartitivirus genus are known to infect plants, fungi, and protist. this is most likely due to high genetic divergence, not allowing identification using DIAMOND search. unpublished sequences of bastrovirus and bastro-like viruses have been identified from rats, pigs, and other bats. phylogenetic tree shows that bastroviruses and hepatitis E viruses form a unique clade, distinct from astroviruses. all bastroviruses form a monophyletic clade, and again they cluster per host species, including the Cameroonian and Vietnamese bat strains. the genus Beta-CoV is further classified into lineages A\u2013A. it is now more plausible that the intermediate host of human MERS-CoV is dromedary camel. infection of E. helvum with lineage D Beta-CoV has been reported at high frequency in Kenya and recently in Nigeria. phylogenetic analysis of at least 700 nt of the representative sequences of the subfamily Coronovirinae showed that all strains are generally clustered by host species. phylogeny based on the capsid showed a cluster of human bastrovirus closest to astrovirus and distantly related to HEV strains. most of the animal bastroviruses form a monophyletic clade except for the two highly divergent strains Bat_Bastrovirus/VietNam/Bat/17819_21 and Bat_Bastrovirus/VietNam/Bat/16715_30. trees were midpoint rooted for purposes of clarity. only bootstrap values greater than 70% are shown except at branches and clusters including the novel bat virus. the genus Beta-CoV is further classified into lineages A\u2013D. it has been identified in a wide variety of hosts including humans, numerous domestic and peridomestic animals, and multiple bat species. single-stranded DNA viruses 5.1 Identification of novel viruses of the family Parvoviridae Parvoviridae is a family of small non-enveloped viruses encoded by a single-stranded DNA genome of 4\u20136 kb with two ORFs. members of the subfamily Parvovirinae infect vertebrates, while members of the subfamily Densovirinae infect invertebrates. Strain BtBoV/CMR/2014 was rather divergent from all other bocaviruses with 45% aa similarity with the closest bocavirus BBoV-SX/CHN/2010 and BBoV-H18/CHN/2008. both novel parvoviruses share 85% amino acid identity in the NS1 protein and therefore likely constitute new species within their respective genera. CMRBtDV2 and CMRBtDV3 are almost 99% identical and closest to CMRBtDV1 (44% aa identity), but with just 17% and 18% aa identity to CMRBtDV4 and CMRBtDV5 respectively. the presence of parvoviruses in bats is very unlikely to be associated with infection given that they have not been shown to infect vertebrates. the genomes of most CRESS-DNA viruses are 2\u20133 kb in length. they encode both a replication initiator protein (Rep) and a capsid protein (Cap) and contain a DNA stem loop structure required for the initiation of DNA replication. both genomes contain two ORFs encoding a Rep and capsid protein. both identified genomic sequences clustered with the above mentioned strain. cycloviruses found in bat feces may infect insects consumed by bats. authors postulated that cycloviruses found in bat feces might infect insects consumed by bats. the subfamily Densovirinae is comprised of five genera: Ambidensovirus, Brevidensovirus, Hepandensovirus, Iteradensovirus, and Penstyldensovirus. we identified two parvovirus and five densovirus genomes in this study. CMRBtDV1-CMRBtDV3 had a genome organization of two ORFs, ambisense to each other. the closest to a known densovirus was CMRBtDV4, which was nested within the genus Ambidensovirus with an aa identity of 52% with DpLDNV. CMRBtDV2 and CMRBtDV3 are almost 99% identical and closest to CMRBtDV1 (44% aa identity parvoviruses have been identified in fecal and blood samples of bats around the world. the presence of densoviruses in bats is very unlikely to be associated with infection given that they have not been shown to infect vertebrates. CRESS-DNA sequences in different pools tentatively named Bat CyV-LimbeP14/CMR/2014 and Bat CyV-LysokaP4/CMR/2014. both genomes contain two ORFs encoding a Rep and capsid protein with small intergenic region between the 3\u2032 ends of major ORFs. they also contain the circovirus nonanucleotide motif TAGTATTAC at the apex of a potential Podoviridae (22 contigs), and Siphoviridae (20 contigs) families compared bacteriophage richness between female and male bats. adult and young bats (Supplementary Fig. S8B, P = 0.109) and between the three locations sampled. pool Contig sizea Spacer CRISPR sequence E-valueb Accession no.c Bacteria species Family P01 37308 CCAGCGGGAATGTGCCGGGTTCAACTGGACGC 7.05e-09 NZ_CP007731 Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae KPNIH27 Enterobacteriaceae P01 18455 CTGTTGGCAAGCCAGGATCTGAACAATACCGT 4.21e-11 NZ_CP0189 enterica serovar Montevideo Enterobacteriaceae a Contigs identified as phage by Virsorter.
