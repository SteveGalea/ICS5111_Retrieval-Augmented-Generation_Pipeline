{"summary": "grass carp reovirus (GCRV) is a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) virus belonging to the genus Aquareovirus in the family Reoviridae (2). the genome consists of 11 segments (termed S1 to S11) encased in a multilayered icosahedral capsid shell. viral infection triggers the activation of signaling cascades to initiate antiviral immune responses. for host cells, viral infection triggers the activation of signaling cascades to initiate antiviral immune responses. zebrafish MITA has a high level of conservation with mammalian MITA. a deficiency in MITA expression impairs the host antiviral response. the dominant negative mutant of fish MITA is involved in the RLR pathway. acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) papain-like protease (PLP) antagonize innate immune signaling by disrupting MITA dimerization to suppress IRF3 activation (46) there have been few studies regarding the evasion mechanisms used by GCRV to interfere with fish IFN production (8, 10) poly(IC) and SVCV induced the activation of the IFN-1 promoter (IFN-1pro) in epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) cells; however, such an induction was significantly suppressed by the overexpression of VP41. VP41 also impeded the activation of IFN-3pro upon transfection with poly(IC) luciferase activities were monitored 24 h after stimulation. VP41 suppresses ISRE activation induced by poly(IC) luciferase activities were analyzed 24 h after stimulation. ifn used VP41-specific small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in quantitative real-time PCR experiments. knockdown of VP41 increased the GCRV-induced transcription of ifn in grass carp ovary (GCO) cells by the knockdown of VP41. the relative transcription levels were normalized to the transcription level of the -actin gene and are represented as fold induction relative to the transcription level in control cells. VP41 inhibits IFN induction activated by the RLR signaling pathway. previous studies demonstrated that fish RLR signaling cascades also play vital roles in activating the expression of IFN. pRL-TK was used as a control. at 48 h posttransfection, cells were lysed for luciferase activity detection. the promoter activity is presented as relative light units normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. VP41 is localized at the ER. EPC cells seeded onto microscopy cover glass in 6-well plates were cotransfected with 2 g VP41-EGFP and 2 g the empty vector (A) or ER-DsRed (B) after 24 h, the cells were fixed and examined by using a confocal microscope. HEK 293T cells were cotransfected with hemagglutinin (HA)-VP41 and Myc-MAVS. the anti-HA Ab-immunoprecipitated protein complexes containing MAVS were not recognized by the anti-HA Ab. however, the anti-Flag Ab-immunoprecipitated protein complexes containing MAVS were recognized by the anti-HA Ab. cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-Myc/Flag affinity gel. the immunoprecipitates and cell lysates were then analyzed by immunoblotting (IB) with anti-HA, anti-Myc, and anti-Flag Abs. shifted bands with higher molecular weights were detected by the anti-Myc Ab. to confirm whether the shifted bands represented phosphorylated MITA, a dephosphorylation assay was performed in vitro. the shifted bands partially disappeared after being treated with calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP) cotransfection with Flag-TBK1 caused shift of IRF3 to higher-molecular-weight bands. in vitro dephosphorylation assay demonstrated that TBK1 was also a conserved phosphokinase for IRF3. VP41 decreases TBK1-mediated phosphorylation of MITA. HEK 293T cells were seeded into 6-well plates overnight and transfected with the indicated plasmids (2 g each) for 24 h. the lysates were then detected by IB with anti-Myc, anti-HA, anti-flag, and anti-actin Abs. (D) overexpression of VP41 inhibits TBK1-mediated phosphorylation of MITA in a dose-dependent manner. the lysates were then detected by IB with anti-HA, anti-Myc, anti-Flag, and anti-actin Abs. both VP41 and MITA contain a TM region in their N termini. previous studies suggested that the TM region is essential for MITA to localize at the ER. VP41 is localized at the ER via its N-terminal TM region. cells were plated onto coverslips in 6-well plates and cotransfected with 2 g ER-DsRed. after 24 h, the cells were fixed and subjected to confocal microscopy analysis. pRL-TK was used as a control. at 48 h posttransfection, cells were lysed for luciferase activity detection. VP41 inhibits TBK1-mediated phosphorylation of MITA. overexpression of VP41 dampens cellular IFN response and facilitates viral RNA synthesis. total RNAs were extracted to examine the transcriptional levels of cellular ifn (A) and s1, s6, and s10 of GCRV (B) by RT-qPCR. GCRV VP41 blocks IFN-1 and IFN-3 induction. fish possess an efficient IFN system to defend against aquatic viruses. but the mechanisms that GCRV uses to escape the host IFN response are still unknown. GCRV VP41 blocks poly(IC)-triggered IFN-1/3pro activation. VP41 blocks SVCV-induced activation of IFN-1pro. luciferase activities monitored 24 h after stimulation. cells were infected with SVCV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10. VP41 suppresses ISRE activation induced by poly(IC) luciferase activities were analyzed 24 h after stimulation. GCO cells were seeded into 6-well plates overnight and transfected with 100 nM siVP41#1, siVP41#2 or siCon. at 24 h posttransfection, total RNAs were extracted to examine the transcriptional levels of s8. VP41 suppresses activation mediated by RIG-I, MAVS, or MITA. cells were seeded into 24-well plates overnight and cotransfected with a plasmid. pRL-TK was used as a control; pRL-TK was used as a control. confocal microscopy analysis revealed that the green signals of VP41 mainly overlapped the red signals of the ER marker. as a positive control, cells transfected with MITA-EGFP and ER-DsRed also showed an overlapping image. VP41 colocalizes with MITA after 24 h. cells were cotransfected with 2 g VP41-EGFP and 2 g MITA-DsRed. VP41 associates with TBK1 and HEK 293T cells seeded into 10-cm2 dishes. after 24 h, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc gel. the immunoprecipitates and cell lysates were then analyzed by immunoblotting. cells were plated onto coverslips in 6-well plates and cotransfected with 2 g VP41-DsRed and 2 g MITA-EGFP, MITA-N-EGFP, or MITA-C-EGFP plasmids. after 24 h, the cells were fixed and subjected to confocal microscopy analysis. all experiments were repeated three times, with similar results. a band shift of VP41 was observed when TBK1 and TBK1 were cotransfected. the cell lysate was treated with CIP to identify whether the shifted band represented phosphorylated VP41. the competition between VP41 and TBK1 to be phosphorylated by TBK1 was examined. HEK 293T cells were seeded into 6-well plates overnight and transfected with the indicated plasmids (1.5 g each) for 24 h. the lysates were then detected by immunoblotting (IB) with anti-Myc, anti-HA, anti-flag, and anti-actin Abs. HEK 293T cells were seeded into 6-well plates overnight and transfected with the indicated plasmids (2 g each) for 24 h. the lysates were then detected by IB with anti-HA, anti-Myc, anti-flag, and anti--actin Abs. (F) VP41 decreases TBK1-mediated phosphorylation of IRF3. the function of the TM region of VP41 in IFN regulation was then monitored by a luciferase assay. VP41-TM did not affect the TBK1-mediated phosphorylation of MITA. VP41-TM protein has no effect on poly(IC)/SVCV-triggered IFN-1 induction. at 24 h posttransfection, cells were untreated (null) or treated with poly(IC) (C) or SVCV (MOI = 10) (D) the luciferase activities were monitored 24 h after stimulation. VP41 inhibits IFN-1 activation mediated by MAVS or MITA. the lysates were then detected by IB with anti-HA, anti-Myc, anti-Flag, and anti-actin Abs. all experiments were repeated at least three times, with similar results. to determine whether VP41 interferes with the cellular IFN response to facilitate viral RNA synthesis, GCO cells were transfected with VP41. total RNAs were extracted to examine the transcriptional levels of cellular ifn (A) and s1, s6, and s10 of GCRV (B) by RT-qPCR. the relative transcription levels were normalized to the transcription level of the -actin gene and are represented as fold induction relative to the transcription level in control cells. there are several reasons for viruses to choose MITA as a target. for example, MITA is involved in regulation of cellular proliferation, differentiation, and programmed death. abolishing the MITA function is necessary and effective for viruses to escape from the host IFN response. phaviruses use viral membrane-bound proteins as organizer proteins of the RNA replication complex (55) viruses are also directed to the ER membrane for the evasion of immune responses. a hydrophobic TM region was predicted in the N terminus of VP41 (5), but the functions of VP41 for the viral life cycle or immune evasion are still unclear. in some viruses, one viral protein can antagonize host antiviral components to promote the efficiency of IFN inhibition. for HCV, NS3/4A cleaves TRIF, and NS4B targets MITA. this also suppressed IFN expression in a luciferase assay. further study is needed to ascertain other molecular events of GCRV. SVCV, a negative single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) virus, was propagated in EPC cells until CPE was observed. the cultured media with cells were harvested and stored at 80\u00b0C until use. the cDNA fragment encoding GCRV VP41 was amplified by RT-PCR. cDNA fragment encoding truncated VP41 (VP41-TM) was inserted into the pcDNA3.1(+), pCMV-Myc, or pEGFP-N3 vector. promoter sequences of iFNs (IFN-1pro and IFN-3pro) were cloned and inserted into the pGL3-Basic luciferase reporter vector (Promega) the empty vector pcDNA3.1(+) was used to ensure that there were equivalent amounts of total DNA in each well. at 48 h posttransfection, luciferase activity was normalized on the basis of Renilla luciferase activity. HEK 293T cells were used instead of EPC cells due to the superhigh transfection efficiency of HEK 293T cells. cells seeded into 10-cm2 dishes overnight were transfected with a total of 10 g the indicated plasmids. the immunoprecipitates and whole-cell lysates were analyzed by IB with the indicated Abs.
