{"summary": "study investigated population exposures to live birds during the outbreak of avian-origin influenza A(H7N9) in 2013 and compared them with those observed during the 2006 influenza A(H5N1) outbreak. the prevalence of buying live birds from wet markets, touching when buying and slaughtering birds at home had substantially declined in the 2013 survey. avian-origin influenza A(H7N9) virus emerged in early 2013 causing more than 100 human infections in eastern china between February and may 2013. estimates of fatality risk for patients admitted to hospital indicated that H7N9 virus infection was more severe than seasonal influenza but less so than A(H5N1) infection. temporary closure of live poultry markets (LPMs) in major cities in eastern China was associated with rapid reduction in incidence of confirmed human H7N9 cases. a brief report on public attitudes, perceptions and changes in household buying of live birds from wet markets has been published [10]. the detailed assessment of population behaviours regarding live poultry exposure should be able to assess the effectiveness of risk communication of the Chinese government since the outbreak of H7N9 in march 2013. a population-based survey was conducted in Guangzhou city between march and June 2006. it involved 1,550 adults aged 18 or above completing face-to-face interviews. this survey involved 1,550 adults (including 1363, 98 and 89 residents from the urban areas) sampling was first stratified by three residential areas: urban districts, Conghua and Zengcheng, to represent areas with different level of geographical closeness to the confirmed H7N9 infection in a chicken. prevalence of buying live poultry among the general public in the urban and semi-rural areas was estimated to be 70\u201380% [11]. the questionnaire was pretested for length, content validity and comprehensibility. the final questionnaire took around 5\u201310 minutes for each interview. most questions collected information on behaviors related to live bird exposures. e 2 + b 3 e d u 1 + b 4 e d u 2 + b 5 g e n d e r (1) In Eq (1), Y is the behavioral outcome of interest while b0 is the intercept and b1-b5 are the coefficients for the corresponding confounders. logistic regression models were also conducted to calculate and compare proportions of common behaviours and perceptions relating to live bird exposure and avian influenza a and Zengcheng did not differ by gender, age or marital status. the total sample were generally representative of the Guangzhou general population. the sample were slightly better educated and more likely to be married or formerly married.
