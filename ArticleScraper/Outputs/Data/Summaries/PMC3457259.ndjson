{"summary": "genus Gammacoronavirus is an enveloped, nonsegmented, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus. the coronavirus employs a discontinuous RNA synthesis mechanism for its transcription. multiple subgenomic mRNAs contain a short 5\u2032 leader sequence. X-YL9 are 27,706 and 27,582 nucleotides (nt), respectively, in length. compared with the most popularly used vaccine strain, H120, they shared 95.9% nucleotide identity. their genome organizations are classical IBV genomes with the characteristic gene order 5\u2032-Pol-S-3a-3b-E-M-5a-5b-N-3\u2032. the high frequency of recombination in IBV likely plays a major role in the generation of new serotypes of the virus (11). the results will help us understand the molecular evolutionary mechanisms of IBV and disconcordance between the genotypes and serotypes of coronaviruses."}
