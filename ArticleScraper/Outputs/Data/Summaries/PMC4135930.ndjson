{"summary": "the host mobilizes the innate immune system, including induction of antiviral cytokines, as the first line to destroy most of the invaders. the host mobilizes the innate immune system, including induction of antiviral cytokines. viruses are able to acquire mechanisms by which they selectively translate viral RNAs by using the host translational machinery but inhibit the translation of host mRNAs. viruses have evolved mechanisms to counteract PKR activation. eIF4E, eIF4G, and eIF4A constitute a complex named eIF4F that controls the mRNA translation initiation. the host produces less IFN-, attenuating innate antiviral response and causing higher susceptibility to virus infection. eIF4GI can be recruited specifically to the 5\u2032 untranslated region (5\u2032 UTR) of the viral mRNA through interacting with influenza virus NS1 protein. eIF4B can increase the phosphorylation of eIF4B to promote protein synthesis during lytic replication (27). eIF4B also plays a key role in regulating the IFN-induced expression of ISG15 protein (28). eIF4B also plays a key role in regulating the IFN-induced expression of ISG15 protein (28). cDNA encoding IFITM3 or ISG15 was subcloned into the pFLAG-CMV-5a vector with a Flag tag in the COOH terminus. cDNA encoding IFITM3 or ISG15 was subcloned into the pFLAG-CMV-5a vector with a Flag tag in the COOH terminus. mice were inoculated intranasally with 5 104 PFU of the A/WSN/33 virus. cDNA was synthesized using 2 g of total RNA and MMLV reverse transcriptase. hemagglutinin (HA) assay performed as previously described (32) for plaque assay, MDCK cells infected with serial dilutions were washed with PBS and overlaid with -minimal essential medium containing low-melting-point agarose (Promega, Madison, WI) and TPCK (tolylsulfonyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone)-treated trypsin (Sigma-A supernatants were diluted with PBS and mixed with 0.5% chicken erythrocytes. thawed samples were centrifuged at 2,000 g for 10 min. the supernatants were titrated by plaque assay as described above. eIF4B knockdown transgenic mice were generated as previously described. plasmid was linearized and microinjected into the pronucleus of fertilized zygotes harvested from C57BL/6J mice. eIF4B, anti-phospho-eIF4B (Ser422), anti-NS1 and anti-ISG15 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); anti-iFITM3, anti-MxA, and anti-PKR (Proteintech, Beverly, MA); anti-influenza A virus NP (kindly provided by Wenjun Liu, Institute of microbiology, Beijing, China); and other antibodies (obtained as described previously) female mice (5 to 6 weeks old, 18 to 20 g) were inoculated intranasally with 5 104 PFU of the A/WSN/33 virus. at the indicated time postinfection, the mice were euthanized and their organs (lung, spleen, thymus, and liver) were removed aseptically. hemagglutinin (HA) assay and hemagglutinin (HA) assay performed as previously described (32) for plaque assay, MDCK cells infected with serial dilutions of supernatants were washed with PBS and mixed with an equal volume of 0.5% chicken erythrocytes. viral titers were counted from the highest dilution factors. ung virus titers were determined 72 h postinfection. mice were homogenized in 1 ml of ice-cold PBS and frozen at 80\u00b0C for 14 h. thawed samples were centrifuged at 2,000 g for 10 min. eIF4B were cloned into an expression vector under an H1 promoter. the plasmid was linearized and microinjected into the pronucleus of fertilized zygotes harvested from C57BL/6J mice. we investigated the effect of the virus infection on the eIF4B level in these lymphoid organs. protein levels of eIF4B decreased significantly in the spleen and thymus but not in the liver of infected mice. together, our data indicate that IAV infection reduced expression of eIF4B protein both in vitro and in vivo. the amount of eIF4B mRNA was not significantly decreased after infection of A549 cells with the virus. eIF4B mRNA levels in MEFs infected with the virus remain unchanged compared with the control. half-lives of eIF4B in uninfected and infected A549 cells were examined. eIF4B levels shown in panel A were quantitated by densitometry. in each experiment, the highest level of eIF4B is set to 100. proteasome inhibitor MG132 and lysosome inhibitors NH4Cl and chloroquine were employed to define how IAV infection causes protein degradation of eIF4B. treatment with either NH4Cl or chloroquine almost completely prevented IAV-induced protein degradation of eIF4B. A549 cells stably expressing specific shRNAs targeting NS1 or luciferase control were infected with WSN viruses (MOI = 1) and harvested at the indicated times, followed by Western blotting using the indicated antibodies. the results are representative immunoblots from three independent experiments with similar results. Western blotting using the indicated antibodies revealed the influence of viral proteins on the eIF4B protein level. neuraminidase, hemagglutinin, neuraminidase, and matrix protein 2 (M2) significantly decreased the amount of eIF4B protein. the viral replication was measured by hemagglutinin assay and plaque assay. hemagglutinin assay and plaque assay showed that the viral titers were significantly increased when expression of the endogenous eIF4B in A549 cells was silenced by the specific shRNA. this was further verified by plaque assay. eIF4B knockdown A549 cells overexpressing eIF4B and control cells were infected with WSN viruses as described for panel C. titers in the supernatants of these cells were examined by plaque assay (18 h p.i.) eIF4B knockdown mice showed a faster body weight loss than wild-type littermates during the viral infection. this suggests that silencing eIF4B expression promotes the production of influenza virus in vivo. wild-type and eIF4B knockdown mice infected intranasally with WSN. each symbol represents an individual mouse. pathological changes of lungs in TG mice were more serious than in WT counterparts. eIF4B knockdown makes mice more susceptible to influenza virus infection. eIF4B regulates IFITM3 protein expression to influence replication of influenza virus. cDNA microarray profiles the cellular transcriptional response to influenza virus infection in a549 cells. eIF4B knockdown A549 cells and control cells were uninfected or infected with WSN viruses for 12 h. the cells were harvested, and cell extracts were prepared for Western blotting using the indicated antibodies. expression of ISGs is critically important for host defense against virus infection. to this end, forced expression of ISG15 or IFITM3 in these cells was performed and influenza virus replication was examined. overexpression of ISG15 only slightly decreased the viral replication triggered by eIF4B knockdown. overexpression of IFITM3 almost completely prevented the viral replication induced by eIF4B silencing. eIF4B knockdown mice and wild-type littermates were infected with influenza virus. eIF4B knockdown also resulted in a decreased expression of IFITM3. IFITM3 protein levels after eIF4B infection shown in panel C were quantitated by densitometry and normalized to -actin levels. in each experiment, the IFITM3 level in control cells is 100. expression of eIF4B was not affected by herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. after mice were intranasally infected with A/WSN/33 for 3 days, protein levels of eIF4B were markedly reduced in the lung samples. influenza virus infection leads to the shutdown of some cellular protein expression by inhibiting transcription or inducing mRNA degradation in host cells. eIF4B mRNA levels in MEFs infected with the virus remained unchanged compared with the control. the half-life of eIF4B was estimated to be approximately 32 h in uninfected control cells. infection with the virus dramatically shortened the half-life of eIF4B to 16 h. IAV infection promotes protein degradation of eIF4B in the cells. treatment with MG132 and lysosome inhibitors NH4Cl and chloroquine did not reverse the effect of IAV infection on the eIF4B protein level in A549 cells. this suggests that IAV-induced eIF4B degradation is by the lysosome pathway and not via the proteasome pathway. eIF4B levels shown in panel D were quantitated by densitometry and normalized to -actin levels. eIF4B levels in A549 cells transfected with empty vector (Mock) were normalized to -actin levels. the results are representative of three independent experiments. the influence of viral proteins on the eIF4B protein level was examined by transient expression of WSN viral proteins. overexpression of NS1 but not other viral proteins. eIF4B-overexpressing A549 cells were generated by stably infecting the cells with lentivirus encoding eIF4B. the cells were then infected with WSN, and the viral replication was measured by hemagglutinin assay and plaque assay. both hemagglutinin assay and plaque assay revealed that forced overexpression of eIF4B resulted in a significant reduction. the supernatants of cell culture were examined for the viral titers. eIF4B knockdown A549 cells and control cells were infected with WSN viruses. titers in the supernatants of these cells were examined by plaque assay. eIF4B knockdown transgenic mice were examined by plaque assay. the viral titers in lung tissues of infected mice were higher than those of wild-type littermates. this suggests that silencing eIF4B expression promotes the production of influenza virus in vivo. shown is the body weight change of wild-type mice (WT) and eIF4B knockdown mice (TG) mock infected or infected intranasally with WSN. the results are shown as mean percentage weight changes from three independent experiments. abundant inflammatory cells were present in the alveoli and diffuse in the peribronchiolar and perivascular regions in the lungs of infected eIF4B knockdown mice. eIF4B regulates IFITM3 protein expression to influence the replication of influenza virus. western blotting showed that silencing eIF4B had no significant effects on protein levels of PKR and p58IPK in IAV-infected or -noninfected cells. eIF4B knockdown A549 cells and control cells were uninfected or infected with WSN viruses for 12 h. A549 cells stably expressing the shRNAs targeting IFITM3, ISG15, or luciferase were infected with WSN viruses (MOI = 0.1) the supernatants of cell culture were examined for the viral titers. eIF4B overexpression increased IFITM3 protein levels after IAV infection or IFN- treatment. eIF4B knockdown also resulted in a decreased expression of IFITM3 in MEFs infected with the influenza virus. in each experiment, the IFITM3 level in control cells (sh-Luciferase) is 100. shown is Western blot analysis of lysates of eIF4B overexpressing A549 cells and control cells treated with or without IFN- (500 U/ml) for 12 h. NS1 of influenza virus, a multifunctional nonstructural protein, plays a critical role in interfering with the type I IFN response. it prevents virally induced type I IFN production by suppressing RIG-I signal transduction and inhibiting the activation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) (41\u201343), crucial for countering type I IFN-mediated antiviral responses. a recent study has defined a key regulatory role of eIF4B in the ISG protein expression during the influenza virus infection. this is the first report of a key regulatory role for eIF4B in the ISG protein expression during the influenza virus infection. this suggests that influenza virus has evolved a strategy to target eIF4B protein to circumvent the host antiviral responses. the effect of eIF4B deficiency on the viral replication could be completely reversed by the forced expression of IFITM3. it is a critical antiviral factor that mediates cellular innate immunity to multiple pathogenic viruses, including influenza virus (9, 48\u201351) B reduction in spleens and thymuses in vivo."}
