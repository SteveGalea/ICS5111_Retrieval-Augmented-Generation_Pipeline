{"summary": "HIV polyprotein Gag localizes to the plasma membrane (PM) and membranes of late endosomes. CIITA localizes to the PM and at the membranes of endosomes and specialized vesicular MHC class II compartments. CIITA acts cytoplasmically to enhance Pr160gag-pol levels. the virally encoded protease begins to cleave Gag, which is required for complete virion maturation and infectivity. geny virions at cellular membranes begin to cleave Gag, suggesting that budding is not limited to one cell-type specific locale [8], [9], suggesting that budding is not limited to one cell-type specific locale [8], [9], further, host factors which participate in targeting Gag trafficking to particular membranes are largely unknown both immature and mature forms of HLA-DR can be found at the PM. expression of HIV-1 Nef, Vpu and Gag have been shown to alter HLA-DR trafficking. a connection between HLA-DR and Gag trafficking would not be surprising. in HEK-293T cells expressing HLA-DR, there was a redistribution of Gag to intracellular compartments. mature virus budded into HLA-DR containing multivesicular bodies and was retained. we hypothesize that recapitulating endogenous expression of the entire class II antigen presentation pathway in producer cells via expression of CIITA would restore infectious virus release. expression does not induced HLA-DR-mediated Gag retention. expression of the class II heterodimer, HLA-DR, induces intracellular accumulation of Gag. CIITA-mediated coordinate activation of HLA-DR, -DM and Ii expression is insufficient to overcome Gag retention. CIITA does not induce HLA-DR-mediated Gag retention. this population was absent in cells transiently or stably expressing CIITA. CIITA does not induce HLA-DR-mediated Gag retention. fewer virus particles are released from a CIITA-expressing cell. CIITA increases virion infectivity independently of HLA-DR and the class II pathway. producers cells were transfected with HIV-1NL4-3 and the indicated plasmids. CIITA has two effects on the HIV replicative cycle in producer cells. i) it does not induce HLA-DR, mediated intracellular retention of Gag and ii) it increases the infectivity of HIV virions. CIITA could increase Gag recycling back to the PM. 4-3 and Gag retention was monitored by intracellular staining and flow cytometry (B) and infectious virus release was measured via GHOST infectivity assays (C) data are representative of three independent experiments and error bars indicate standard error. CIITA was transiently expressed with the HLA-DR heterodimers in producer cells. finzi et al. (2006) truncated the cytoplasmic tails of both HLA-DR and pcDRcyto. loss of either cytoplasmic tail (pcDRcyto and pcDRcyto), or both cytoplasmic tails (pcDRcytocyto), did not alleviate Gag retention. however, flow cytometry to monitor surface HLA-DR expression demonstrates that transient transfection of HLA-DR induces an approximate half-log to log producer cells with HIV-1NL4-3 and infectious virus release (C) and infectious virus release (D) were transfected with increasing amounts of HLA-DR in the presence of HIV-1NL4-3 DNA. as HLA-DR expression increased, the level of infectious virus release decreased. a positive correlation (r = 0.9954) between Gag accumulation (Gaghi) and increasing HLA-DR expression (Figure 4D) suggests Gag retention is likely related to HLA-DR overexpression. integrase (IN[p32]), reverse transcriptase (RT [p66/51]) and protease (p10), as well as the transframe octapeptide (TFP) and p6* are generated from the Gag-Pol polyprotein. analysis of cell lysates from equal numbers of HIV-1 transfected A293T-CIITA and A293T cells showed a higher ratio of mature CAp24 to Pr55Ga western blotted virions from vector-only (A293T-CIITA) cells (B) were western blotted with an antibody which recognizes CAp24 of Gag. virions from transient-CIITA expressing (pcCIITA) or stably-expressing CIITA (A293T-CIITA) were western blotted for Gag processing. CIITA may increase viral protease processing of Gag. we examined Gag processing and infectious virus release from CIITA-expressing HIV producer cells in the presence of a protease inhibitor. CIITA acts cytoplasmically to improve and enhance Gag processing. a panel of CIITA mutants were co-expressed with HIV-1NL4-3 DNA. the mutants are defective for nuclear localization and fail to activate HLA-DRA transcription. CIITA acts cytoplasmically to increase HIV virus maturation independent of its transactivation function. production cells were transfected with the indicated CIITA constructs and HIV-1NL4-3; 48 h later infectious virus titers were determined by GHOST assay. CIITA increases the viral protease through increased Gag-Pol levels. expression of the HIV protease is extremely toxic to cells, and is thus very tightly regulated during virus replication. cells were transiently co-transfected with either CIITA or pcDNA and HIV-1NL4-3 DNA to inhibit the majority of Gag polyprotein processing. expression of CIITA increased this level to almost 5%, indicating that CIITA increases Gag-Pol levels in virus producer cells. a weak but uniform Gag signal was present in vector-only transfected cells. transient HLA-DR expression induced a marked redistribution of Gag. however, transient expression of HLA-DR in producer cells does indeed lead to Gag retention. CIITA increases virion infectivity independently of HLA-DR and the class II pathway. fewer virus particles are released from a CIITA-expressing cell, but those particles are significantly more infectious. infectious virus (A) and virus particle release (B) were determined by a GHOST infectivity assay. the number of infectious virions per total number virions released from a live cell was also determined (C) the infectivity of virions from cells expressing HIV-1NL4-3 was also determined (D) the level of Rab4 expressed in CIITA-expressing A293T cells was determined by immunoblotting. CIITA specifically associates with the Rab4B and not the Rab4A promoter. however, when Rab4B and HLA-DR were co-expressed in producer cells, it did not rescue intracellular retention of Gag. expression of CIITA is not sufficient to compensate for HLA-DR-mediated Gag retention. however, when HLA-DR is endogenously expressed under the control of CIITA, retention is alleviated. finzi et al. (2006) demonstrated that Gag retention in HLA-DR+, multivesicular bodies could be alleviated when the cytoplasmic tails of the HLA-DR and chains were removed. transient transfection of HLA-DR induces an approximate half-log to log-fold increase in HLA-DR as compared to cells stably or transiently expressing CIITA. induced Gag retention is a consequence of HLA-DR overexpression in this transient system. CIITA expression enhances virion maturation through increased Gag processing. the mature complement of HIV-1 structural proteins includes matrix (MA [p17] and capsid (CA [p24]), nucleocapsid (NC[p7] and p6, as well as spacer peptides, SP1 [p2] and SP2 [p1] within Gag. p41 (MA-CA-SP1) and p25 (CA+p2) products were increased. CIITA enhances virion maturation through increased Gag processing. virions from cells transiently or stably expressing CIITA were western blotted. blots were performed and quantitative analysis of Gag cleavage products is presented as percentage of total reactive bands (C, E and G) virions from HLA-DR-expressing cells exhibited less Gag processing than virions from CIITA-expressing cells. virions from both cell lines were affinity-purified on HLA-DR binding columns. reduced Gag processing correlated with decreased infectious virus release. CIITA-mediated enhancement of Gag processing and viral infectivity is through the viral protease. CIITA acts cytoplasmically to improve and enhance Gag processing. CIITA cytoplasmically increases Pr160Gag-Pol levels. producer cells were transfected with indicated constructs and HIV-1NL4-3. CIITA cytoplasmically increases Pr160Gag-Pol levels. western blotting allowed for the determination of the percentage of Gag-Pol and Gag, following normalization to -actin (D). unless indicated, data are representative of three independent experiments. CIITA increases the viral protease through increased Gag-Pol levels. cytoplasmic CIITA mutants increase Gag-Pol levels relative to Gag. CIITA enhances Gag-Pol protease expression, which subsequently enhances virus maturation and infectivity. CIITA does not induce intracellular retention of Gag or impair virus release. we did not observe Gag retention when class II antigen presentation pathway genes were expressed at endogenous levels via CIITA expression. overexpression of HLA-DM also induced Gag retention, suggesting that retention of Gag is a likely consequence of altered trafficking of overexpressed class II antigen presentation pathway components. Stumptner-Cuvelette et al.(2003) and Chaudhry et al.(2009) have independently demonstrated that HIV Nef induces internalization of surface class II in epithelial and monocytic cell lines. gluschankof and Suzan demonstrated that expression of Gag-Pol restored HLA-DR presence at the cell surface in the H78-C10.0 line. the presence of higher levels of processing intermediates in CIITA-expressing cells may explain the reduced infectivity. studies in both MLV [65] and HIV [7] demonstrate that partially cleaved Gag products act transdominantly to reduce virion infectivity through reduced reverse transcription of viral RNA. the CIITA L1035P mutant failed to translocate to the nucleus [58]. overall infectivity of virions from CIITA-expressing cells increased. at 0.6 nM Lopinavir, the infectivity of virions increased over vehicle-treated controls, despite reduced Gag processing. further, the mutants of CIITA, which produced the highest level of Gag-Pol, did not demonstrate a linear increase in Gag-Pol. therefore it is likely that CIITA is capable of increasing Gag-Pol levels to a point which can impede virus infection of epithelial cells provides potential in vivo significance to this study. most other cells can be stimulated to express CIITA in the presence of IFN- (i.e. a pro-inflammatory environment), which is induced during HIV infection of the GALT. the haplotyping of HLA-DR isotypes expressed by A293T cells was determined by the Transplantation Immunology Lab, Albany Medical College. primers containing forward restriction site XbaI and reverse restriction site HindIII were designed to include an intact Kozak sequence upstream of the translation start site. the p32cDNA was donated by the Peterlin laboratory. both MHC II expressing VLPs and MHC II-negative VLPs were produced and concentrated 10-fold in a 100 K molecular weight cut-off filter tube. RT-PCR 1ug of cDNA was run out on a non-denaturing gel. hybridoma (ATCC, Manassas,VA) supernatant diluted 110 in PBS/2% FBS for 30 minutes on ice, washed, and then incubated with goat- anti-mouse Alexa-Fluor 488- or Alexa-Fluor 647-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes/Invitrogen) diluted 1100 in PBS/2% FBS for 20 minutes on ice in the dark the percentage of total HIV-1 CA p24 (183-H12-5C) [79] reactive bands was used as a measure of Gag processing. intracellular Gag staining 106 cells were permeabilized with IntraPrep Permeabilization Reagent (Beckman-Coulter) for approximately 15 m prior to analysis and data interpretation as performed above. cell lysates were used to monitor the levels of Pr55Gag to Pr160Pol via western blotting with HIV-1 CA p24 (183-H12-5C) after 17 hours. CIITA-stable A293T cell lines were generated by co-transfecting PVU I linearized pDNA3.FLAG.CIITA8 [75] and pCMV4His. 5 plasmids were then used for site-directed mutagenesis using primers indicated (Table S1). transfections of all plasmids, including: pDNA3.FLAG.CIITA8 [75], CIITA-GTP2 and -GTP3 [56] and CIITA -L1035P [58], p33-143 (coding for the p33 and p35 isoforms of invariant chain\u2013a kind gift provided by Dr. both MHC II expressing VLPs and MHC II-negative VLPs were produced and concentrated 10-fold in a 100 K molecular weight cut-off filter tube (Millipore) for 15 minutes at 4000 rpm prior to titering via HIV-1 p24 CA Antigen Capture Assay Kit were performed following manufacturer's instructions. RT-PCR 1ug of DNA-free RNA was run out on a non-denaturing gel to ensure equal concentrations cells were incubated with L243 monoclonal antibody conjugated to AlexaFluor 488 or 647 (BioLegend) diluted 150 in PBS/2% FBS for 40 minutes on ice in the dark. for Gag retention experiments, live cells were gated, followed by gating of DR+ cells and then the percentage of Gag and Gaghi cells were gated. virions were purified using the MACS Streptavidin Kit (Miltenyi Biotec Inc., Auburn, CA.) for approximately 15 m prior to analysis and data interpretation. GHOST assay and p24 ELISAs to determine virus particle release were performed using the HIV-1 p24 CA Antigen Capture Assay Kit. quantitative PCR was performed on A293T cells transfected with the indicated constructs (A), where the Hut78 T cell line served as a positive control. expression of HLA-DR on the surface of cells transfected with the indicated plasmids was assessed."}
