{"summary": "results We are interested in investigating the extent of perturbation of model membranes caused by a functional concentration of the peptides. it has been shown that SARSFP and SARSIFP are able to induce membrane fusion only at high peptide-to-lipid molar ratio15,22. we chose a 20:1 lipid/peptide molar ratio for most of the experiments. es on the pretransition of DPPC and DPPG and also on the higher-temperature transition found in the peptide-containing DPPS vesicles. Buffer used was 20 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.4. the parameters from DPPG samples at 150 mM NaCl (salt) are also shown. TP and Tm stand for the pretranstion and main phase transition temperatures. DPPC and DPPG exhibited two endothermic events. the main phase transition of DPPS vesicles is split into two endothermic events, one centered at 51.1 \u00b0C and the other centered at 52.2 \u00b0C. this two-peak feature has been attributed to different protonation states of the head group polar moiety32. more prominent effects on the enthalpy change and on the cooperativity of the transition of zwitterionic POPE vesicles were observed. SARSFP decreased the transition H by about 25%, whereas SARSIFP decreased it by 16%. a third, low-enthalpic peak was observed in DPPS/peptide vesicles. this result indicates a different mechanism of PS-peptide interaction compared to the other negatively charged lipids. a low-enthalpy peak also appeared in the peptide-bound POPS vesicles at a temperature slightly higher than the Tm of the peptide-free POPS vesicles. the peptides promoted different effects on the thermograms of DPPG, DPPS, POPS, and POPA. peptides that induce positive membrane curvature will increase TH of the DiPoPE/peptide samples and thus stabilize the liquid-crystalline bilayer phase41. pic L-HII phase transition of DiPoPE was observed at 44.3 \u00b0C (HH = 136 cal/mol) and at 47.5 \u00b0C (HH = 107 cal/mol) at low and high ionic strength, respectively. curvevature strain induced by fusion peptides. the high inaccuracy on the values of HH was due to extensive lipid aggregation of peptide-free and peptide-containing DiPoPE vesicles from different sample preparations. however, the general trend of decreasing the HH of the transition in the peptide-containing DiPoPE samples was observed in all experiments. despite perturbation of the DPPC thermotropic parameters caused by the peptides, the peptide-bound peptides did not significantly perturb the local structural dynamics of the head group or the hydrophobic core of the zwitterionic MLVs. the experimental and best-fit NLLS simulations are presented in Supplementary Figs S4 and S5. the meaning of this negative value for S0 of DPPTC was extensively discussed in the fluid phase of DPPC dispersions (S0 = 0.32 at 50 \u00b0C) in terms of the analysis of the Cartesian components of the restoring potential U()45. in the gel phase, there is a molecular force field in the head group that tends to align the TMA group perpendicular to the surface, giving rise to a negative order parameter45. a greater tendency of the preferential orienting axis of TMA to orient along the local director of the membrane would lead to the same interpretation. the changes in the order parameter S0 (S0 = S0[peptide/lipid] S0[lipid]) of DPPTC, 5-PCSL, and 16-PCSL in pure DPPG liposomes upon peptide addition at temperatures corresponding to the gel (25 \u00b0C), ripple gel (37 \u00b0C) and fluid ( a possible explanation would be the partitioning of DPPTC in the gel-like and fluid-like domains of DPPG in the ripple gel phase. a single averaged spectrum from which both gel-like and fluid-like populations are not resolved. the effect of the peptides on R and S0 should be analyzed with caution. the 16-PCSL probe is more sensitive to molecular motions than DPPTC and 5-PCSL43,48. the structural dynamics of the gel-like and fluid-like lipid states could be resolved and characterized. only SARSFP was able to decrease R below Tm, with the most significant change observed for 5-PCSL at 25 \u00b0C. phosphoryl-Tempo-choline group of DPPTC is more loosely packed in the gel phase of the pure DPPS bilayer. peptide addition to pure DPPS increased the ordering of the head group in the gel phase. a very broad lineshape in the ordered DPPS gel phase persisted. this line broadening effect is due to strong dipolar interactions. this is due to strong dipolar interactions that arise from cluster formation of the PC spin labels in the DPPS milieu. SARSFP and SARSIFP only changed the ordering and R of the spin labels at 25 \u00b0C. at 37 \u00b0C, the ESR spectra from peptide-free and peptide-bound vesicles are almost identical. peptide binding to POPA head group causes an increase of mobility. the result is probably related to the lack of a bulky head group of POPA. the surface area per lipid of PA head group is smaller than that of PG or PS. the unsaturation of the oleyl acyl chain of POPA would allow for a dynamic bending of the end chain of the spin label that favors much more the alignment of both zR and yR axes to the bilayer vector than xR, the direction of the NO bond. this same effect was observed by Ge et al. with 16-PCSL in POPC/POPS model membranes49. these results allow us to infer that this second component does not present the same properties of fluid-state lipids but rather peptide-bound lipids. peptide binding to POPA bilayers gives rise to peptide-enriched and peptide-free domains, where the latter is barely affected by the peptides. insertion of inverted cone-shaped molecules such as lysophosphatidylcholine 1-palmitoyl-2-hydroxyl-PC (LP fusion promoter (inhibitor) AA (LPC) may help to induce (prevent) membrane fusion. equimolar mixtures of DPPC/DPPG and DPPC/POPA membranes. ESEEM has been successfully applied to examine the penetration depth profile of deuterium-substituted molecules. we used a D2O-containing buffer to probe the deuterium environment surrounding the spin labels DOPTC, 5-PCSL, and 16-PCSL (Supplementary Fig. S1). lipids, peptides and possibly residual H2O contribute to the spectral density at 14.25 MHz, but the 1H signal was not further analyzed. peaks are absent in the 16-PCSL ESEEM spectra because the distance between the spin probe moiety in the bilayer midplane is beyond the limit of the technique. doublet of intensity I(2H) and amplitude arises from quadrupole interaction between electron spin and non-2H-bonded water molecules inside the bilayer54. both peptides depend linearly and nonlinearly, respectively, on concentration of free water molecules at a distance of 0.5 to 1.0 nm56. the spin label at C5 position is able to monitor water density around C5 up to the level of the carbonyl-glycerol and phosphocholine regions. the contribution from bulk water molecules to the spectral density of 5-PCSL is negligible54,56. the same reasoning holds true for the 16-PCSL. reorientation of phosphoryl-Tempo-choline due to peptide-lipid interactions may be such that it allows formation of nitroxide-water complexes. the contribution to stems mainly from water molecules belonging to the second hydration shell (>0.4 nm) up to 1 nm. the thermotropic phase behavior of different multilamellar vesicles (MLV) in the absence and in the presence of 5 mol% of peptides were determined. the membrane-associated peptides remain folded in the liquid crystalline phase of the phospholipids22,23. blank 9.40 39.8 0.36 \u2014 30.0 30.9 SARSFP 4.57 39.6 0.38 \u2014 14.6 31.0 SARSIFP 5.73 39.9 0.63 \u2014 \u2014 18.3 32.2 DPPG (salt) blank 9.31 40.0 0.56 39.2 \u2014 29.7 33.0 SARSFP 6.08 40.0 0.50 \u2014 19.4 33.0 SARSIFP 4.41 40.1 0.61 \u2014 \u2014 14.1 33.9 DPPS blank 6. multilamellar vesicles of DPPC and DPPG exhibited two endothermic events in the temperature range studied. the low-enthalpic, broad pretransition arises from the conversion of the lamellar gel phase, L\u2019, to the ripple gel phase, P\u2019. the more energetic and more cooperative main phase transition arises from the conversion of P\u2019 to the liquid-crystalline phase, L. a broadening of the DSC thermogram may be the result of a decreased transition cooperativity (1/T1/2) however, the enthalpy and entropy changes of the main phase transition were significantly altered, especially for membranes containing negatively charged lipids. the lower-temperature endothermic peak certainly arises from peptide-bound membranes. the higher-temperature peak can be due to peptide-free POPA vesicles in the POPA/SARSFP samples. the two-component feature of DPPS main phase transition remained in the peptide-containing DPPS samples. a low-enthalpy peak also appeared in the peptide-bound POPS vesicles at a temperature slightly higher than the Tm of the peptide-free POPS vesicles. this more stable and much less energetic peak may be due to specific PS-peptide interaction. both peptides are positively charged at pH 7: SARSFP, +2 e SARSIFP, +1. th, phosphatidylethanolamines, such as DiPoPE, spontaneously form lipid bilayers in the liquid-crystalline state. peptides that induce positive membrane curvature will increase TH of the DiPoPE/peptide samples and thus stabilize the bilayer phase41. sample HH (cal/mol) TH (\u00b0C) T1/2 (\u00b0C) DiPoPE (0 mM NaCl) 136 44.3 2.0 +0.2 mol% SARSFP 91 47.9 2.4 +0.5 mol% SARSFP 74 50.2 3.7 +0.2 mol% SARSIFP 92 45.4 1.7 +0.5 mol% SARSIFP 40 44.6 2.2. SARSFP (SARSIFP) induced positive (negative) membrane curvature strain on DiPoPE/peptide vesicles at high ionic strength. these findings imply that the peptides induced positive (negative) membrane curvature strain on the diPoPE/peptide vesicles at high ionic strength. the experimental and best-fit NLLS simulations are presented in Supplementary Figs S4 and S5. the best-fit magnetic tensor components, rotational diffusion rates and order parameters are summarized in Supplementary Tables S3\u2013S6. if we compare the S0 values of DPPTC from our studies with that obtained by Ge and Freed, we might infer that the orientation of the TMA group lies in between the one in DPPG (S0 = 0.37) and the other in POPA (S0 = 0.29) differences in the TMA orientation are likely due to distinct orienting forces that arise from the particular hydrogen-bonding network provided by the PG, PS, and PA bilayers. DPPG-bound peptides remarkably restrict the mobility of the head group region. changes correspond to the same level of alteration caused by the influenza hemagglutinin fusion peptide on the ordering of DPPTC in POPC (S0 = 0.02) or in dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC; S0 = 0.05)46. in contrast, S0 decreased by about 0.02 and 0.06 at 37 \u00b0C. S0 was calculated as the difference between the S0 obtained from the peptide-containing liposome with that of the peptide-free liposome. the more fusogenic SARSFP consistently increased the ordering of 5-PCSL and 16-PCSL more than SARSIFP. TC and 16-PCSL embedded in DPPS at temperatures corresponding to gel (37 and 50 \u00b0C) and fluid (60 \u00b0C) phases of the membrane. most striking changes were observed in the very ordered DPPS gel phase. changes in the ordering and mobility of different regions of DPPS bilayers in the gel and fluid phases. the 16-PCSL ESR spectra at 50 \u00b0C presented two components with different ordering and dynamics. the spectra of 5-PCSL in the peptide-free DPPS obtained at temperatures below Tm presented very broad resonance lines. both R and S0 were only slightly affected by the membrane-bound peptides at 60 \u00b0C. binding of the peptides to DPPS promoted a better partition of 5-PCSL in the membrane. no change in the ESR lineshape at both 25 \u00b0C and 37 \u00b0C upon peptide addition was observed. peptide insertion seems to be activated either by temperature or by loosening of the hydrophobic packing of the highly ordered DPPS gel phase. peptide insertion in the membrane seems to be activated either by temperature or ultimately by loosening of the hydrophobic packing of the highly ordered DPPS gel phase. 16-PCSL was 0.01 (Supplementary Table S5) in the peptide-free POPA liposomes. this indicates a large deviation from cylindrical symmetry of the molecular alignment of the end-chain label to the local director of the membrane. this result indicates a strong preference for the rotational diffusion axes zR and yR of the nitroxide moiety to align along the normal to the bilayer. the 16-PCSL ESR spectra at 25 \u00b0C presented two components with different ordering and dynamics. the most striking effect of both peptides was the appearance of a second, more ordered and highly-populated (5060%) component. this second site is characterized by following parameters: S0 = 0.22, S2 = 0, and R 8 107 s1, for SARSFP. insertion of inverted cone-shaped molecules such as lysophosphatidylcholine 1-palmitoyl-2-hydroxyl-PC (LPC) into the outer monolayer would prevent membrane fusion supposedly by promoting positive membrane curvature50,51. Conversely, insertion of cone-shaped molecules such as phosphatidylethanolamine, arachidonic acid (AA) and linoleic acid (LA) into the outer monolayer would facilitate membrane fusion effects of membrane fusion promoter and inhibitor on the membrane surface ordering of lipid bilayers. peptide-induced ordering of anionic vesicles is possibly related to membrane dehydration. the different spin labels allowed investigating the changes promoted by the peptides in the water content from the lipid/water interface down to the hydrophobic core of the bilayers. changes in the modulation depth of the time-domain ESEEM spectra or in the deuterium spectral density yield information about D2O molecules situated near the nitroxide within a distance range of up to 1.0 nm. the deuterium peak is composed of two spectral components: a low-intensity broad signal that arises from a direct deuterium bond between D2O and the nitroxide radical. both and I(2H) depend linearly and nonlinearly, respectively, on the concentration of free water molecules at a distance of 0.5 to 1.0 nm56. the differences are most likely due to different freezing protocols, sample preparation, and experimental conditions such as the choice of, the first interpulse delay. both peptides interact with POPC/POPG membranes and displace free water molecules from their hydrophobic core. the nitroxide radical of the DOPTC phosphoryl-Tempo-choline group is in direct contact with both membrane surface and bulk water molecules. changes in the orientation of the phosphoryl-Tempo-choline must therefore locally disturb the water density around the spin label. incorporation of cholesterol into PC membranes, for example, decreases the ordering of the lipid head group, i.e., makes it less aligned along the bilayer director64. this effect allows for water reorientation of phosphoryl-Tempo-choline due to peptide-lipid interactions may be such that it allows formation of nitroxide-water complexes, affecting mainly I(2H) the contribution to stems mainly from water molecules belonging to the second hydration shell (>0.4 nm) up to 1 nm. SARS-CoV S2 subunit possesses various membranotropic segments. these segments can act independently from each other and may help stabilize contact between viral and cell membranes14,71,72,73,74. monitoring the structural rearrangements of different segments of the intact S2 subunit as well as the dynamics of their interaction with viral and cell membranes on a molecular level constitutes a challenging task. acyl chains of negatively charged membranes seem to be correlated to membrane dehydration. this latter effect seems to be correlated to membrane dehydration. the more ordered the acyl chain46, the more ordered the acyl chain. the van der Waals interactions between the lipid acyl chains in the hydrophobic core of the membrane are much weaker, i.e. the strength of the interaction is about 0.25 kcal/mol, which is even smaller than the thermal energy at 298 K (kBT 0.59 kcal/mol)76. however, enhancement of lipid-lipid interactions due to condensation leads to an increased chain-packing energy. the same ordering effect on the outer monolayer leads to a shrinkage of its surface area that compresses the inner leaflet. the inner layer counteracts the compressive force exerted by the outer monolayer and therefore creates a nonuniform tension in the two leaflets. a uniform membrane bending moment toward the condensed leaflet is induced, which ultimately generates negative membrane curvature. bilayer dehydration can be accomplished by different mechanisms depending on molecular nature of the fusogenic molecule80,81,82. gp41 and influenza HA fusion peptides promote membrane dehydration by increasing the ordering of the lipid bilayers46,47. this conclusion was inferred, though, from the aforementioned S0/dehydration correlation. ers86,87 have shown that the short-lived component of DPH embedded in lipid bilayers originates from a probe population located at the membrane\u2013water interface. therefore, the subnanosecond short-lived component of DPH in the very ordered gel phase of dimyristoyl phosphatidylglycerol (DMPG) found in the absence of SARSFP could thus be due to a shallower interfacial location of DPH in the DMPG bi membrane fusion involves the formation of strongly curved lipid bilayers in the pre-fusion, intermediate, and post-fusion states. it is tempting to investigate the potential ability of fusion peptides to generate membrane curvature. both peptides have the ability to bend DiPoPE lipid bilayers. lipid domains possessing positive curvature flanked by negatively-curved lipid patches that stabilize the local \u2018nipple\u2019 and allow for the establishment of close intermembrane contact16,79,88. both peptides can hypothetically act in this early stage by stabilizing the two curved domains depending on the ionic strength of the environment. fusion peptides from influenza HA37,92 and parainfluenza virus (PIV5) F protein93 have also indicated stabilization of the pore state by fusion peptides from influenza HA37,92 and parainfluenza virus. both peptides can act at different stages of the fusion process to facilitate membrane fusion. choline micelles94 have a high tendency to aggregate and to form intramolecular -sheets and extended -strands stabilized by intermolecular interactions in models of lipid bilayers. however, the structure and oligomerization state of those peptide segments still need to be addressed. membrane-bound self-associated peptides may provide the major driving force for trimerization of the whole protein18,75. the major effects of the peptides at the pre-fusion state could be the following: induction of positive curvature on PE-rich membranes; and membrane dehydration and induction of bending moment on the outer leaflet of bilayers comprised of anionic lipids. the latter effects may also be responsible for triggering stalk formation, which is further stabilized by exposure of PE on the outer leaflet to SARIFP. the higher the S0 the lower is the angular amplitude of the wobbling motion of the spin probe. a better alignment can enhance the molecular interactions between lipid molecules in the bilayer. however, changes in S0 of the lipid head group would have a greater impact on the structural organization of the membrane than changes in the ordering of the acyl chain46. SARSFP and SARSIFP increase the S0 of 5-PCSL and 16-PCSL in DPPG and POPA membranes. both peptides increase the ordering of head group spin label DPPTC in pure PG, DPPS, and POPA. however, an increase of both the head group and acyl chain packing densities of the outer leaflet is the major effect. the largest contribution to the bending moment arises from the ordering of the head group region46. the increase of S0 of DPPTC in the outer leaflet of negatively charged lipid membranes promoted by the SARS-CoV fusion peptides could potentially induce negative membrane curvature. inverse correlation between head group ordering and hydration of lipid bilayers53. a study of the fluorescence decay of diphenylhexatriene (DPH) embedded in membranes has shown that the short-lived component of DPH embedded in lipid bilayers originates from a probe population located at the membrane\u2013water interface. however, the decrease of the DPH lifetime in the presence of SARSFP could potentially stem from the contact of the fluorophore with water molecules at the membrane\u2013water interface. the alterations of the bilayer structure observed for SARSFP and SARSIFP take place at high peptide concentrations. the peptides present membrane fusion activity only at high peptide-to-lipid ratio and regular extended -sheet aggregates are the most populated membrane-bound peptide conformation15,22,23. a wide variety of peptides have been successfully used to probe changes in the intrinsic spontaneous curvature properties of PE vesicles. both peptides have the ability to bend DiPoPE lipid bilayers. lipid domains possessing positive curvature flanked by negatively-curved lipid patches that stabilize the local \u2018nipple\u2019. the hemifusion intermediate would then progress to the formation of the fusion pore state16,88. both monolayers present strong and opposite curvature strains16,88. the outer, negatively-curved monolayer of both the lipidic stalk and the fusion pore states may be stabilized by the fusion peptides depending on the lipid composition. SARSFP and SARSIFP adopt a V-shaped and a linear helical conformation in dodecylphosphatidylcholine micelles94. but have a high tendency to aggregate and to form intramolecular -sheets and extended -strands stabilized by intermolecular interactions. a trimeric extended prehairpin conformation is formed. internal fusion peptide (SARSIFP) and pretransmembrane (SARSPTM) domains of the S2 subunit95 could be facilitated by membrane interaction of a loop peptide segment located in between HR1 and HR2 domains74 and by a possible heteroligomerization of SARSIFP with SARSPTM95. aposition of SARSIFP and SARSPTM leads to a synergistic and cooperative action of both peptides that causes membrane destabilization and further peptide insertion73. the two putative fusion peptides from SARS-CoV S protein may help to regulate membrane fusion by acting in the early and late stages of the membrane fusion process. possible peptide involvement on the formation of the pre-fusion point-like protrusions and intermediate hemifusion stalk as well as on the stabilization of the fusion pore state suggest that the SARS fusion peptides have the ability to change the physicochemical properties of model membranes depending on the lipid composition. ine (DPPS), 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DiPoPE), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1\u2019-rac-glycerol) (POPG), 1-palmitoyl-2-o sample was hydrated in 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, sonicated in a bath type sonicator for a few seconds. samples were then subjected to at least six freeze-thaw cycles. a measured volume of SARSFP or SARSIFP stock solutions in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added to preformed multilamellar lipid dispersions. freeze-thaw cycled six times below the liquid crystalline-to-inverted hexagonal phase transition temperature (L-HII) of the lipid. peptide concentration was 10 mg/ml and peptide concentration varied from 0.2 to 0.5 mol% (500:1 and 200:1 lipid/peptide molar ratio, respectively) the following acquisition parameters were used: center field, 3,362 G; scan width, 80 to 160 G; modulation amplitude, 0.5 or 1.0 G; modulation frequency, 100 kHz; microwave power, 5 or 10 mW; time constant, 128 ms, and acquisition time, 240 s. the integration gate length was 48 ns and the shot repetition time was 1,500 s. the number of accumulations varied from 20 to 50 depending on the signal-to-noise ratio. oyl-sn-glycero-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC), 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1\u2019-rac-glycerol) (DPPG), 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine (DPPS), 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine spin labels (0.5 mol% for CW ESR and 1 mol% for pulsed ESR) either in chloroform or chloroform/methanol 1:1 (v/v) stock solutions were mixed in a glass tube. the sample was hydrated in 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, sonicated in a bath type sonicator for a few seconds. samples were then subjected to at least six freeze-thaw cycles. peptides and lipids dissolved in chloroform/methanol 1:1 (v/v) stock solutions were mixed in a glass tube. samples were hydrated in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, with or without 150 mM sodium chloride. freeze-thaw cycled six times below the liquid crystalline-to-inverted hexagonal phase transition temperature (L-HII) of the lipid. temperature controlled by a homemade temperature control unit coupled to the spectrometer, whose accuracy is about 0.2 \u00b0C. samples were transferred to glass capillaries which were set into a quartz tube containing a mineral oil bath to stabilize the sample temperature. pulse sequence54 was used to suppress unwanted echoes102. the microwave power was adjusted to give 16 ns /2 pulses. an interpulse delay of 236 ns was chosen to maximize deuterium modulations."}
