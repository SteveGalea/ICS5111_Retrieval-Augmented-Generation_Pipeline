{"summary": "the emergence of MERS-CoV in 2012 represents the second severe CoV to strike the human population since the beginning of the 21st century (1). the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coV (SARS-CoV) in 2012 represents the second severe CoV to strike the human population since the beginning of the 21st century (1). mutants with changes in the NSP16 KDKE active site resulted in attenuation of both mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and SARS-CoV (9, 10) dNSP16 MERS-CoV mutant maintained no significant attenuation in terms of replication or the initial host immune response. mutation of any of the KDKE residues has been shown to ablate 2\u2032O-MTase activity. previous alteration of this motif in both group 2b SARS-CoV (10) and group 2a MHV (9) disrupted 2\u2032O-MTase activity. resulting disrupted-NSP16 (dNSP16) mutant had no significant defect noted in stock titer generation. models were created with Modeler in the Max-Planck Institute Bioinformatics Toolkit. the known crystal structure of the NSP16-NSP10 complex was used as the template structure (38) heat maps were constructed from a set of representative CoVs from all four genogroups by using alignment data paired with neighbor-joining phylogenetic trees. both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV dNSP16 mutant infections showed no significant functional enrichment of any categories relative to corresponding WT infections. however, at late times (>24 h postinfection), SARS-CoV produced robust changes in several host pathways. changes in apoptosis, transcription repression, and regulation of phosphorylation indicated a host response more hostile to viral infection. primary HAE cell cultures were challenged with WT and dNSP16 MERS-CoV at a low MOI. dNSP16 MERS-CoV had significant attenuation that corresponded well to previous results obtained with dNSP16 mutant SARS-CoV (10). dNSP16 mutant MERS-CoV replicated efficiently at both days 2 and 4 postinfection. primary HAE cells infected with WT (black) or dNSP16 mutant (red) MERS-CoV at an MOI of 0.01. day 2 and 4 lung titers of adenovirus-transduced mice expressing human Dpp4 infected with WT (black) or dNSP16 mutant (red) MERS-CoV. dNSP16 mutant MERS-CoV attenuated by type I IFN treatment via IFIT1. dNSP16 mutant MERS-CoV attenuated by type I IFN treatment. dNSP16 mutant MERS-CoV attenuated by type I IFN treatment. dNSP16 mutant vaccine protects against a lethal challenge. dNSP16 mutant-vaccinated mice showed only modest weight loss. serum analysis revealed robust virus neutralization with values similar to those seen in serum from WT virus-infected mice. dNSP16 mutant MERS-CoV protects from lethal challenge. challenge of 288-330+/+ CRISPR-Cas9-targeted mice vaccinated with dNSP16 mutant MERS-CoV (red) or mock vaccinated (black) with 106 PFU of passaged mouse-adapted MERS-CoV (15) dNSP16 mutation attenuates the virulence of a mouse-adapted MERS-CoV strain. Graphs show weight losses (A), day 4 viral titers (B) and hemorrhage scores (C) following infection of 288-330+/+ CRISPR-Cas9-targeted mice infected with 106 PFU of MERS-CoV MA1 (black) or dNSP16 MA1 (red) at days coV and dNSP16 mutant infections showed no significant functional enrichment of any categories relative to corresponding WT infections. however, at late times (>24 h postinfection), SARS-CoV produced robust changes in several host pathways, including cytokine responses, inflammation, and extracellular activity. changes in apoptosis, transcription repression, and regulation of phosphorylation indicated a host response more hostile to viral infection. primary HAE cell cultures were challenged with WT and dNSP16 MERS-CoV at a low MOI (Fig. 3A) dNSP16 MERS-CoV had significant attenuation that corresponded well to previous results obtained with dNSP16 mutant SARS-CoV (10). dNSP16 mutant MERS-CoV replicated efficiently at both days 2 and 4 postinfection. day 2 and 4 lung titers of adenovirus-transduced mice expressing human Dpp4 infected with WT (black) or dNSP16 mutant (red) MERS-CoV. dNSP16 mutant MERS-CoV attenuation is mediated by IFN and IFIT1. dNSP16 mutant MERS-CoV attenuated by type I IFN treatment via IFIT1. knockdown augmented replication of dNSP16 mutant MERS-CoV. dNSP16 mutant MERS-CoV attenuated by type I IFN treatment via IFIT1. dNSP16 mutant vaccination protects from a lethal challenge. targeting of NSP16 offers a potential platform strategy for live attenuated vaccine generation. similar phenotypes in other more distant CoVs are essential. 288-330+/+ CRISPR-Cas9-targeted mice vaccinated with dNSP16 mutant MERS-CoV (red) or mock vaccinated (black) with 106 PFU of passaged mouse-adapted MERS-CoV. dNSP16 mutation (D130A) attenuates mouse-adapted MERS-CoV. new tab dNSP16 mutation attenuates the virulence of a mouse-adapted MERS-CoV strain. dNSP16 mutant showed attenuated replication and growth in primary HAE cell cultures, as well as reduced disease in vivo. dNSP16 mutant MERS-CoV had normal replication but was attenuated in the context of type I IFN and IFIT activity. absence of 2\u2032O-MTase activity did not result in an increased type I IFN response. mutants of west Nile virus, dengue virus, and japanese encephalitis are highly replication attenuated at early time points (20, 21) fidelity and inflammation induction are partially responsible for attenuation. failure has been reported in group I CoVs (27) dNSP16 mutant MERS-CoV maintains robust propagation, as well as IFN/IFIT-based attenuation phenotypes. these results suggest targeting ofNSP16 may be the most broadly applicable platform for coV attenuation. studies examining the reversion potential of NSP16 are critical prior to its use as a vaccine. this concerns are especially important considering that both the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV dNSP16 mutants have robust replication. growth curves in vero, Calu-3 2B4 and HAE cells were performed as previously described. cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and inoculated with virus or mock diluted in PBS for 40 min at 37\u00b0C. samples were harvested at the time points described. the two resulting products were digested with SapI (in boldface) and ligated overnight with T4 DNA ligase. this product was then digested with PpuMI and NsiI. plasmids containing mutant MERS-CoV genome fragments were amplified, excised, ligated, and purified. genes identified as differentially expressed were used to generate clustered expression heat maps. this study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations for the care and use of laboratory animals of the office of laboratory animal welfare. animal housing, care, and experimental protocols were in accordance with UNC IACUC guidelines. raw microarray data for these studies were deposited in publicly available databases at the national center for biotechnology information (NCBI) gene expression Omnibus (37) and accessible through GEO series GSE65574. the two resulting products were digested with SapI (in boldface) and ligated overnight with T4 DNA ligase. plasmids containing WT and mutant MERS-CoV genome fragments were amplified, excised, ligated, and purified. in vitro transcription reactions were performed to synthesize full-length genomic. the medium from transfected cells was harvested and used as seed stock for subsequent experiments. RNA isolation, microarray processing, and identification of DE were carried out as previously described (36). differential expression was determined by comparing virus-infected replicates with time-matched mock-treated replicates. mice were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine (in accordance with UNC IACUC guidelines) and intranasally inoculated with a 50-l volume containing 106 PFU of WT MERS-CoV, dNSP16 mutant MERS-CoV, mouse-adapted variants. infected animals were monitored for weight loss, morbidity, and clinical signs of disease, and lung virus titers were determined as described previously"}
