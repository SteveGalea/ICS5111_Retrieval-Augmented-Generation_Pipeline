{"summary": "the world health organization (WHO) recently reported 12.6 million deaths each year due to unhealthy environments. the report also identifies diarrheal diseases, respiratory infections and malaria in the top ten causes of environment related deaths. emerging and reemerging diseases such as chikungunya and Zika have also been linked to climate change influences. only 10% lies over one meter above the mean sea surface. lack of resilience and adaptive capacity, dense population and poverty make the situation worse. very few studies on relationship between environmental variables and trends of infectious disease incidence have been performed so far in Bangladesh. the diagnosis of the six studied diseases was confirmed based on the combination of clinical and relevant laboratory diagnosis. incomplete files, patients discharged on risk bonds and absconded patients were excluded from the study. seasons were divided into four equal groups of three months duration. summer (March to May), rainy season (June to August), autumn (September to November) and winter (December to February). Statistical analysis The results were expressed as mean standard deviation. Encephalitis High fever with altered consciousness and positive CSF findings diagnostic of Encephalitis with or without signs of meningeal irritation. malaria high fever with chills and rigors with or without unconsciousness with or without blood film positive for malaria species. the institutional ethical review committee of Sylhet M.A.G. Osmani Medical College approved this study prior commencement and the requirement for informed consent was waived. a statistician anonymized all data before analysis. Statistical analysis The results were expressed as mean standard deviation and the level of significance was expressed as P values unless otherwise stated. between the years 2008 to 2012, the mean temperature was 25.0\u00b0C, average humidity 76.5% and average rainfall was 275mm in Sylhet region. all six infectious diseases individually increased in number over the five years. pneumonia rose from 131 cases in 2008 to 411 cases in 2012. this increase does not appear to be due to increased numbers of patients using the hospital overall. the highest number of malaria, diarrhea and pneumonia cases occurred in rainy season. the maximum number of enteric fever, encephalitis and meningitis recorded during autumn. the average temperature in our study region during 2008\u201312 was 25.0\u00b0C. an increased number of malaria, enteric fever and diarrhea cases was observed with increased temperature. on the other hand, the cases of encephalitis, meningitis and pneumonia were low. two-way ANOVA test was applied to obtain the level of significance. 5% -77.5% 126 (28.4) 356 (28.7) 261 (30.2) 126 (21.0) 342 (25.3) 162 (30.3) 1373 (27.3) >77.5% 116 (26.2) 346 (27.9) 189 (21.9) 163 (27.1) 302 (22.3) 87 (16.3) 1203 (23.9) Total n (%) 443 (100.0) 1241 (100.0) 863 (100.0) 601 (100.0) 1352 (100.0 disease and different seasons The highest number of cases occurred in autumn (1436; 29%) followed by rainy season (1423; 28%) followed by rainy season (1423; 28%), winter (1204; 24%) and summer (971; 19%). the highest number of malaria, diarrhea and pneumonia cases occurred in rainy season. the maximum number of enteric fever, encephalitis (183) and meningitis (151) cases occurred during autumn. the average temperature in our study region during 2008\u201312 was 25.0\u00b0C. an increased number of malaria, enteric fever and diarrhea cases was observed with increased temperature. on the other hand, the cases of encephalitis, meningitis and pneumonia were low. two-way ANOVA test was applied to obtain the level of significance. 76.5% 201 (45.4) 539 (43.4) 413 (47.9) 312 (51.9) 708 (52.4) 285 (53.4) 2458 (48.8) 76.5% -77.5% 126 (28.4) 356 (28.7) 261 (30.2) 126 (21.0) 342 (25.3) 162 (30.3) 1373 (27.3) >77.5% 116 (26.2) 346 (27.9) 189 (21.9) 1241 (100.0) 8 higher incidences of encephalitis and meningitis occurred while there was low rainfall. incidences of diarrhea (p = 0.002), malaria (p = 0.001), pneumonia (p = 0.002) and enteric fever (p = 0.002) increased with rainfall. the study focuses on individual infectious diseases and explores the relationship between each disease and three common weather variables. it is likely that women get less opportunity to come into hospital and have less access to medical care. there was no significant difference by gender in the frequency of each individual disease except pneumonia and encephalitis. emisinin treatment and other partner organization lead massive drive for malaria elimination, the cases decreased to 1.4/1000 population in Bangladesh. the same report revealed an increasing trend for diarrheal diseases, Kala-azar and skin diseases in three districts (drought-prone Rajshahi, flood-prone Manikganj and salinity-dense Satkhira) between 1999 to 2005. a large number of enteric fever cases (759; 61%) occurred in rainy season and autumn. this agrees with earlier studies in both Dhaka, Bangladesh and a Cambodian study. but no relationship between incidence of enteric fever and season was seen in Kenya. studies have shown a positive relationship between malaria, enteric fever and diarrhea with increasing temperature. a significant increase in malaria cases with increasing temperature was seen in Rwanda and Uganda [54, 55], but this was not seen in studies done in the African highland region [56, 57] our study shows an inverse relationship between encephalitis, meningitis and pneumonia with temperature. the findings are consistent with a study done in china, but not with another study conducted in Spain. encephalitis cases in Sweden have reportedly increased in response to a succession of warmer winters. oencephalitis syndrome may be caused by bacteria favoring dry and dusty weather. heavy rainfall may trigger behavioral changes such as increased contact between people and distribution of pathogens in floodwater. a positive relationship between increased rainfall and enteric fever was also found in Dhaka, Bangladesh and southern Australia. death rate in the first 24 hours due to these infections was low and unlikely to influence our results [69] due to limitations of funding and time, we conducted this study in only one hospital of northeastern region of Bangladesh."}
