{"summary": "clinical trial material was manufactured in qualified vero cells at Charles River Laboratories (Malvern, PA), stored at \u201370\u00b0C, and diluted on site using qualified Leibovitz L15 medium. study population, study design, and clinical trial oversight This trial was conducted at the center for immunoization research, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. for adults and HMPV-seropositive children, clinical assessments and nasal washes were performed on study day 0. a clinical assessment and NW were performed on days 0, 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, 14, 17, 19, 21, and 28 1 day. for seronegative children, a clinical assessment and NW were performed on days 0, 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, 14, 17, 19, 21, and 28 1 day. the lower limit of detection was 2.1 log10 copies/mL. a plaque-reduction neutralization assay and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay quantitated immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to the HMPV fusion protein were used. the studies were conducted in accordance with the Standards of Good Clinical Practice as defined by the International Conference on Harmonization. the clinical protocol, consent forms, and investigator's Brochure were reviewed and approved by the Western Institutional Review Board and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. in adults and seropositive children, specimens were obtained 1 month after inoculation. in seronegative children, specimens were obtained 2 months after inoculation. the lower limit of detection was 0.6 log10 copies/mL. eness associated with shedding of human coronavirus OC43 [1 subject]; nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, pharyngitis, cough, hoarseness, wheezing, headache, and fatigue associated with detection of RSV type A. rHMPV-Pa was highly attenuated in adults. a 106.0 PFU dose was evaluated in 15 HMPV-seropositive children. Peak Titer (log10 copies/mL) Mean of 1/log2 (SD) 4-Fold Rise (%) Mean of 1/log2 (SD) 4-Fold Rise (%) Before Vaccine After Vaccine Before Vaccine After Vaccine Adults Vaccine recipientsc 6.0 15 0 0 13 7 13 0 13 0 0.6 (0.0) 2.1 7.7 (0.9) 7.8 (0.9) 0 13.3 (1.0) 12.9 (1.4) 0 0 12. the limit of detection of vaccine virus by culture was 0.6 log10 PFU/mL. the limit of detection by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was 2.1 log10 copies/mL. the percentage shedding virus was as detected by culture or RT-qPCR. a 106.0 PFU dose was evaluated next in 15 HMPV-seronegative children (10 vaccine recipients, 5 placebo recipients) each of these recipients was asymptomatic. 50% of recipients of the 106.0 PFU dose were infected with vaccine virus. the need for placebo-controlled trials and assessment for adventitious viral infections in young children are warranted. rHMPV-Na bears the AMPV N gene rather than the AMPV P gene and was shown to be less attenuated than rHMPV-Pa in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts of NHPs."}
