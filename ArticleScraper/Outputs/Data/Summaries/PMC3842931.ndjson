{"summary": "prophylactic vaccination using \u2018non-self\u2019 antigens has opened new avenues for vaccination approaches that target eradication of established tumors cells. recent phase III trials have shown that patient-specific cellular vaccines containing tumor antigens can improve survival of patients even with advanced disease [7,8]. GM-CSF can foster cell death of CD8+ effector T cells. pleiotropic cytokines must be delivered to cells that optimally induce and maintain anticancer immune responses. attenuated viral vectors exhibit several advantages that make them attractive vaccine vehicles for antitumor vaccination. coronavirus-mediated gene transfer to DCs should be considered as a versatile approach for antitumor vaccination. we evaluated the impact of Flt3L or lymphoid cytokines co-expressed with a GFP-tagged model antigen in murine coronavirus vectors. IL-2 and IL-15 showed a significantly lower adjuvant effect on CD8+ T cell priming and failed to protect against established tumors. fusion protein of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and gp33 CD8+ T cell epitope derived from the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. genes encoding for murine Flt3L, IL-2 or IL-15 were inserted between the replicase and spike genes. propagation of MHV-based vectors was achieved in 17Cl1 packaging cells that provide the E protein in trans (Figure 1B) cells were infected at an MOI of 1 and titres in supernatants were determined at the indicated time points. cells were harvested 24 h later and EGFP expression on CD11c+ cells was assessed. ed in high cytokine production after 48 h, whereas IL-15 could neither be detected in serum nor in spleen. maturation of DCs is critical for induction of protective immunity [23], we determined expression of the maturation markers CD40 and CD86 on in vivo transduced, EGFP+ DCs. three independent experiments with three mice per group (mean SEM, n=9) showed expression of the DC maturation markers CD40 and CD86 in transduced EGFP+CD11c+ cells (+) and non-transduced EGFP+CD11c- cells (-) cells (*, p 0.05; **, p 0.01). MHV-gp vectors failed to raise a substantial response against the gp33 epitope. the vector-encoded Flt3L promoted a broadening of the antigen reactivity towards gp33. this finding was corroborated using adoptive transfer of gp33-specific P14 TCR transgenic T cells one day before application of the vectors. splenic CD8+ tet-gp34-binding T cells were immunized i.v. with 105 pfu of the indicated vectors or infected with 200 pfu of LCMV WE. Frequencies (B) and total numbers (C) of splenic CD8+ tet-gp34-binding T cells were determined at indicated time points. 5105 B16F10-GP or parental B16F10 cells were applied to mice. this resulted in metastatic growth of tumor cells in lungs. prophylactic vaccination with 102 pfu of IL-2 or IL-15 encoding vectors reduced the tumor burden, whereas the same dose of Flt3L completely prevented tumor growth. i.v. mice were immunized with the indicated doses of the different vectors or infected with 200 pfu LCMV WE. seven days later mice were challenged with 5105 B16F10-gp melanoma cells or the parental B16F10 cells. we applied 5105 LCMV-GP recombinant Lewis lung carcinoma cells s.c. into prophylactically vaccinated B6 mice. only FLt3L-encoding vectors achieved an almost complete block of tumor growth. maturation of DCs through vector-encoded cytokines is essential for the generation of therapeutic tumor immunity against a peripheral solid tumor. onavirus vectors were designed on the basis of the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) genome. to achieve propagation deficiency, MHV-encoded accessory genes (NS2, HE, gene4, gene5a) were deleted and the non-structural protein 1 (nsp1) was truncated by introducing a mutation that reduces MHV pathogenicity, but retains immunogenicity. neither transduction with MHV-gp vector induced any of the three cytokines nor did the cytokine-expressing vectors elicit non-specific cytokine production. thus, coronavirus vectors can specifically deliver antigen and different immune-modulatory cytokines to their major target cells. i.v. application of 106 vector particles into C57BL/6 (B6) mice. EGFP expression was detectable mainly in MHCII (IAb)highCD11c+ DCs. in vivo delivery of IL-2 and Flt3L resulted in high cytokine production. IL-15 could neither be detected in serum nor in spleen. values in dot plots (A) and bar graph (B) show the mean percentage SEM of EGFP+IAbhigh cells gated on CD11c+ cells. data from two independent experiments with three mice per group (n=6) induction of gp34-specific CD8+ T cells responses was best supported by Flt3L leading to superior expansion of tetramer-binding CD8+ T cells and differentiation towards IFN--producing effector T cells. MHV-gp vectors failed to raise a substantial response against the H2-Db-binding gp33 epitope, whereas vector-encoded Flt3L promoted a broadening of the antigen reactivity towards splenocytes were analyzed for expression of CD8 and reactivity with H2-Kb/gp34-tetramers. at day 7 post immunization, spleenocytes were analyzed for expression of CD8 and reactivity with H2-Kb/gp34-tetramers. tumor immunity elicited by coronavirus vectors Induction of potent CD8+ T cell responses against tumor antigens is critical to establish and maintain tumor immunity. cytokine-encoding vectors can elicit therapeutic tumor immunity, mice were. melanoma cells had almost completely covered the whole lung surface in control and MHV-gp vaccinated mice. ten days later, i.e. at day 20 post tumor inoculation, melanoma cells had almost completely covered the whole lung surface in control. only vaccination with the Flt3L-encoding vector was able to significantly reduce the tumor load. metastatic tumors such as the B16 melanoma cells can reach secondary lymphoid organs and thereby contribute \u2013 most likely due to their MHC class I expression \u2013 to the amplification of antitumor CD8+ T cells. tumors which arise in peripheral tissues can escape immune surveillance in the absence of appropriately activated T cells. tumor immunity induced by 105 pfu of different vectors applied on day 4 post s.c. inoculation with 5105 gp-recombinant Lewis lung carcinoma cells. values indicate mean tumor volume SEM (n=9 mice) the ability of DCs to induce antigen-specific tumor immunity can be enhanced by immunological adjuvants such as toll-like receptor ligands. cytokines that stimulate the myeloid compartment such as the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) facilitate DC maturation and foster their survival. IL-2 and IL-15 are highly efficient adjuvants that have been shown to enhance tumor-specific T cell responses. it is important to note that neither the secreted and systemically acting IL-2 nor the more locally acting IL-15 reached the efficacy of the DC-stimulating Flt3L. coronavirus-based vectors that express DC-stimulating cytokines should be further developed for their utilization in therapeutic cancer vaccination. cytokines are highly efficient and facilitates generation and maintenance of antitumor CD8+ T cells. erythrocyte-depleted bone marrow cells generated by culturing. GM-CSF containing supernatant from the cell line X63-GM-CSF. spleenocytes were resuspended in RPMI/5% FCS. cells were stained with different lineage markers and analyzed for EGFP expression. single cell suspensions of 106 splenocytes were incubated for 5 h at 37\u00b0C. cells were stimulated with phorbolmyristateacetate (PMA, 50 ng/ml) and ionomycin (500 ng/ml) protection was determined as numbers of metastasic foci per lung on day twelve post tumor inoculation. mice received 5105 tumor cells i.v and were immunized ten days later with the indicated vectors. tumor clearance was determined on day twenty and recorded as percentage of affected lung surface. all mice were maintained in individual and ventilated cages. 17Cl1 cells were a kind gift from S. G. Sawicki. LCMV WE strain was obtained from R. M. Zinkernagel. low density cells were recovered from the interface and resuspended in RPMI/5% FCS. antibodies were purchased from BD Biosciences Pharmingen (CD11c-PE), or Biolegend (CD40-APC, CD86-APC, IAb-Alexa fluor 647. the percentage of tet+CD8+ T cells and CD8+ T cells producing IFN- was determined using a FACSCanto flow cytometer using the FACS Diva software. GP33 (KAVYNFATC) and GP34 (AVYNFATC) peptides were purchased from Neosystem (Strasbourg, France) tumor volume was recorded as V= x abc/6, whereby a, b and c are the orthogonal diameters. comparison was done using one way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s post test or with Bonferroni multiple comparison test as indicated."}
