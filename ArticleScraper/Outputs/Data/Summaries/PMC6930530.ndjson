{"summary": "in vivo studies, many nutraceuticals were reported to be poorly absorbed in the GIT, thus limiting bioavailability. ginseng polysaccharides have been reported to enhance absorption of ginsenoside Rb1 [20]. biodegradation occurs in the stomach or gut lumen, where membrane permeability and metabolism are key factors in absorption. properties of TPGS (vitamin E TPGS) have been described to enhance the delivery of drugs, nutraceuticals, nanoparticles, and dietary nutrients. TPGS has an amphiphilic structure comprising of a hydrophilic polar head portion and lipophilic alkyl tail. TPGS 1000 (1000 denoting the PEG chain molecular weight) has been approved by the eu as a GRAS supplement to solubilize drugs in oral, parenteral, topical, topical, nasal, and rectal/vaginal therapies. TPGS has a proven record of safety and efficacy in pharmaceutical, dietary supplement, food and beverage, personal care, animal nutrition, and cannabinoid products. polyethylene glycol succinate (ITPGS) is prepared from natural lipid-soluble -tocopherol (vitamin E) by grafting to a polyethylene glycol oligomer through a succinate diester linker. the iron transport polyethylene glycol succinate (TPGS) molecule incorporates the iron transport aspect from ovotransferrin (formerly known as conalbumin) ITPGS/TPGS may increase bioavailability of pharmaceuticals, herbal products, and nanomedicines. the mechanism by which water-soluble TPGS enters the enterocytes is described by Neophytou and Constantinou [25]. in vivo and in vitro studies, water-soluble vitamin E TPGS has been investigated for various properties, such as solubilizer, micellar property as a surfactant, additive or emulsifier in drug formulations. TPGS acts as a reversal agent for P-gp mediated MDR and inhibits P-gp mediated drug transport. a mechanistic understanding of the inhibition of P-gp by TPGS gives new insights into the structure activity relationship and improves rational design of more potent P-gp inhibitors. TPGS significantly enhanced oral bioavailability of the phytomedicine berberine chloride. antioxidative properties of ITPGS are based on hydrolysis by cytoplasmic esterases that liberate free -tocopherol. this localizes in the cell membranes and quenches free radicals. this protects the membrane from lipid peroxidation and damage. ovotransferrin molecules have shown antioxidant properties via different mechanisms. anti-inflammatory properties Gastrointestinal inflammation can be induced by a large number of microorganisms. a dysbiotic microbiota may be sufficient to provoke intestinal inflammation. failure of the gut is an important pathophysiological phenomenon of the generalized inflammatory response that leads to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) study examined the actions of lactoferrin (Lf) to prevent the prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) effect on Na+-dependent glucose cotransport (SGLT1) for glucose absorption in enterocytes. findings showed that PGE2 inhibits SGLT1 in a concentration- and time-dependent manner with an inhibitory constant (Ki) of 50.0 nmol/L. a pathway for glucose absorption in cells of a PGE2-mediated inhibition of SGLT1 that is intercepted by Lactoferrin (Lf) shows a schematic pathway for glucose absorption in cells of a PGE2-mediated inhibition of SGLT1 that is intercepted by ovotransferrin. ovotransferrin may also work in the same manner and have similar mechanism to increase glucose uptake. ITPGS appears to maintain a healthy inflammatory response in the body by regulating biomarkers such as interleukins and TNF-alpha. antimicrobial properties In vitro and in vivo studies suggest that iron (Fe2+ or Fe3+)-binding protein \u2018transferrin\u2019 in ovotransferrin exerts antimicrobial properties. ovotransferrin deprives pathogenic bacteria of iron and other nutrients needed for survival. 5% would be more than enough to kill all types of bacteria found in these studies. many pathogenic bacteria need less iron or no iron for their survival. dysbiosis is an imbalance in composition and number of gut commensal microorganisms. the host\u2019s iron and dietary iron are reported to alter the microbiota composition leading to dysbiosis. ovotransferrin improved the diversity and richness of the intestinal microbiome. the human gut microbiota is composed of more than one hundred trillion microbial cells. the bacterial community is the most prominent factor in maintaining homeostasis of this complex gut environment. the bacterial community is the most prominent factor in maintaining homeostasis of this complex gut environment. gut microbiota-derived products can be absorbed from the gut and enter into the host\u2019s endogenous and exogenous pathways. metabolites generated by the host can be secreted into the gut via the enterohepatic circulation. failure of the gut can lead to MODS, as in most cases, gut dysfunction precedes the development of MODS. the antibacterial activity of ovotransferrin towards Escherichia coli strain W1485 was tested by Valenti et al.. the results of the antibacterial activity of ovotransferrin are shown in Figure 3. ovotransferrin and lactoferrin have nearly identical abilities for antimicrobial activity against E. coli and Streptococcus mutans. this suggests functional equivalency between ovotransferrin and lactoferrin for at least their bacteriostatic actions against pathogenic bacteria. this suggests functional equivalency between ovotransferrin and lactoferrin. in vitro studies have shown that tight junctional proteins are present at the base of basolateral membranes between two neighboring enterocytes flanking the extruding cells. the use of microbiota manipulation to improve animal health is a promising and ongoing field of research. the microbiota plays a pivotal role in regulating immunological tolerance to allergen exposure outside the GIT. ovotransferrin is the donor of iron for the ITPGS. ovotransferrin is also effective in controlling diarrhea caused by PEDV. recent unpublished data of an in vivo study show that IT can prevent E. tenella infestation in 7\u201321 days old chicks. IT can be used to treat and control subclinical coccidiosis to prevent morbidity and mortality in the poultry industry. the use of commensal microbiota and its associated medical comorbidities is common in older populations. multi-morbidity and the associated use of multiple medicines is common in older populations."}
