{"summary": "etiological agents consist of an expanding range of species (previously genotypes) of negative-strand RNA viruses of the Lyssavirus genus. rabies occurs across Africa, the Americas, Australia, and eastern Europe and Asia, from polar regions to temperate latitudes. rabies is endemic within tropical areas, and is perpetuated by domestic and wild carnivores, and by many species of bats. human rabies mortality can be reduced through ensuring administration of vaccine and immunoglobulin (postexposure prophylaxis, PEP), following extensive washing of the wound, to all bite victims from infected animals. effective vaccines for animals are available, and most developed countries have eliminated canine rabies [15\u201317], responsible for the vast majority (99.9%) of all human cases [18], by preventing the disease in dogs. rabies remains a \u201cneglected\u201d zoonosis largely because it occurs in communities suffering from poverty and inequitable human and animal health care. rabies ranks low within national and international agendas, in spite of being present in more than 150 countries/territories. rabies is a \u201ctransboundary\u201d disease, and basic intersectoral cooperation at any level requires a breadth of expertise, not residing in one single health ministry, agricultural department, academic endeavor, or private enterprise. rabies is a disease that is primarily seen as a public health issue with limited impact on production animal health or small animal private practice. public-private partnerships can bring together the power, resources, and experience from both the industrialized and the developing world to create synergies, define priorities, and find solutions. there are many examples of successful public-private partnerships that have pooled their resources and coordinated global strategies to increase the availability of scarce and expensive medical interventions for those that need them most. the rabies expert bureau (MEEREB) is a recent example of professionals in Canada, Mexico, and the united states working together, sharing surveillance data and prioritizing applied research needs. a much wider (global) approach is needed in strategies aimed at rabies elimination, recognizing that the threat of rabies is evident on every continent throughout the world excluding Antarctica. this is the first time a working group has joined to find workable solutions to rabies control, including timelines and deliverables. the individuals in the PRP are unpaid volunteers, comprised of the essential disciplines needed towards a common cause of advocacy, action, and research. key elements for canine rabies elimination Gaps identified Strategy agreed upon Partners providing expertise to address gap Program established to address gap Human rabies prevention Lack of awareness about appropriate rabies prevention strategies Increase awareness about strategies and prevention behaviors amongst public health practitioners and community members Health communicators (GARC), global public health organizations, academic partners, vaccine industry, country representatives, regional networks Evaluate cost effectiveness of different vaccination strategies for pre- and postexposure vaccination. health economists, global public health organizations, academic partners, vaccine industry, country representatives, regional networks Evaluate cost effectiveness of different vaccination strategies for pre- and postexposure vaccination as well as mass dog vaccination (PRP, WHO, BMGF, OIE, FAO) Strengthen/build national capacity to carry out mass dog vaccination campaigns. canine Rabies Blueprint completed Develop user-friendly field-based techniques for rapid detection and reporting of rabies cases in humans and animals.

sustainability and innovative funding mechanisms to support long-term rabies control GARC. a \"road map for rabies prevention and control\" was initially developed. the network of the PRP agreed to use their resources to increase educational awareness for rabies prevention and control. rabies prevention messages have been sent to more than 150 million people across the globe. the PRP combined their knowledge, efforts, and resources to define specific strategies that would enable canine-rabies endemic countries to design their own national programs for preventing human rabies. there was no integrated standard operating procedure or \u201cBlueprint\u201d bringing together all necessary aspects for a \u201cOne Health\u201d approach to controlling rabies. the PRP maintains a light governance structure, meeting biannually to discuss global issues regarding rabies prevention and control, identify gaps and how best to address them. the elimination of both canine and human rabies is a feasible objective in rabies endemic areas of the less developed world [12, 29, 44, 46\u201350] rabies control strategies should only be considered where independent transmission cycles are detected in species other than dogs. a sustainable rabies control and prevention program, therefore, consists of two essential components, an \u201cattack/elimination\u201d component and a \u201cmaintenance\u201d component. local authorities often view costly oral vaccination of free-roaming dogs as the only solution to the rabies problem in the reservoir population. however, the vast majority of domestic dog populations have affiliations to households/communities and are accessible for central-point parenteral vaccination. participation in dog vaccination campaigns can be increased by improved engagement of local communities through education and awareness. awareness about prevention behaviors among community members, particularly children, is critical. the integration of dog rabies control and human rabies prevention approaches is important at the start of the program. progressive declines of canine rabies should ultimately result in reduced demand for human biologics [61] the role of global health communications is key to effective rabies prevention and control. a higher level of awareness is a key to effective public and animal health policy and action at all levels. a higher level of awareness is a key to effective public and animal health policy and action at all levels, prioritization of rabies in national and international budgets. the first step of the communications plan is to identify the important points from an epidemiologic assessment. challenges may be behavioral (e.g., beliefs on the use of medicine or vaccines), demographic (e.g., economic implications), or physical (e.g., access to healthcare or clean water) the elimination of canine and human rabies is a feasible objective in rabies endemic areas of the less developed world [12, 29, 44, 46\u201350]. a fully integrated approach is critical for achieving this significant goal. a radical \u201cparadigm shift\u201d in strategic planning and implementation activities is required by the many countries focusing solely on human rabies prophylaxis to prevent human deaths. the \u201cattack/elimination\u201d component combines activities aimed at preventing the occurrence of human rabies by reducing virus transmission in the dog population. it includes: (1) mass vaccination of the maintenance dog population, (2) management of the dog population, and (3) improved access to wound cleaning necessities. continuous epidemiological surveillance is essential to monitor the effectiveness of intervention in animal and human populations. the effectiveness of mass dog vaccination campaigns can be increased through management of the dog population. rabies elimination should be restricted to suspect rabid dogs, unvaccinated contact dogs, and dogs considered unsuitable for rehoming or release at the point of capture. ies-free status includes surveillance networks to uncover potential new cases or infected areas, regulations for in-country animal movements and animal trade, capacity for dog vaccination, and educational channels linking government officials and local communities. an assessment of the rabies situation in neighboring areas is important, followed by the establishment of rabies control and prevention efforts in these jurisdictions. the world rabies day initiative is an example of the global impact that health communications can have on rabies prevention and control efforts. a comprehensive 8-step rabies communications plan, adaptable to the cultural, political, and behavioral needs of any location, has been developed for incorporation into a canine rabies elimination program. rabies epidemiology and the behavioral beliefs of the individuals most at risk will vary across localities. outreach should be targeted to specific audiences, who can be segmented according to those most at risk, the primary audience (e.g., children and young boys, who in many areas take care of dogs), and influencers of the primary audience (e.g., healthcare providers, community leaders, and policy makers). a number of pilot programs have been established recently across Asia and Africa. the first phase of the humane program is planned for 2008\u20132012. in a second phase (after 2012), CMC will assume primary financial responsibility from WSPA. the current humane program is an evolution of the elimination and pound system of rabies control and dog population management that existed prior to 2007. 44,776 dogs had been vaccinated in 537 banjars by the end of may 2010. the average coverage at the end of the first one-day vaccination campaign was 81%. in all cases, a second vaccination campaign resulted in over 70% coverage. the bohol project has mobilized around 15,000 people including local government officers, animal and human health workers, school teachers, village leaders, and volunteers. the project has mobilized around 15,000 people including local government officers, animal and human health workers, school teachers, village leaders, and volunteers. rabies elimination demonstration projects have been implemented in africa and Asia. the project aims at vaccinating about 700,000 dogs regularly during the project duration. the program has already achieved reduction in dog and human rabies prevalence through mass mobile vaccination campaigns. yas group of islands covering 25% of the total number of animal rabies cases, 28% of the total cases of human rabies, and 27% of animal bites in the entire country. the project serves almost 19% of the country's human population (with 17 million inhabitants in the area) and an estimated 2 million dogs. increased vaccination and dog management efforts have led to a considerable reduction in dog rabies cases. the combined education program on bite prevention, rabies awareness, and responsible dog ownership has led to greater primary knowledge and its retention. 85% of primary and 78% of secondary school children gained the required knowledge immediately after education sessions. by the end of may 2010, 44,776 dogs had been vaccinated in 537 banjars. the average coverage at the end of the first one-day vaccination campaign was 81%. in 81 of the 537 banjars (15%) the coverage was estimated to be below 70%. a second vaccination campaign was launched. the bohol project has mobilized around 15,000 people including local government officers, animal and human health workers, school teachers, village leaders, and volunteers. since its inception in 2007, the project has mobilized around 15,000 people including local government officers, animal and human health workers, school teachers, village leaders, and volunteers. three large-scale rabies elimination demonstration projects have been implemented in africa and Asia. the project aims at vaccinating about 700,000 dogs regularly during the project duration. the project serves almost 19% of the country's human population. the project site in south-east Tanzania includes Dar es Salaam, Lindi, Mtwara, Morogoro, and Pwani Regions. the overall project is designed to be extended into neighboring regions and countries in an effort to achieve regional and international success towards broader canine rabies elimination. rabies is a primary public health issue, but is not without agricultural impacts. major obstacles are the lack of priority given by the agricultural sector to the control of animal health problems unrelated to livestock species. veterinary services may handle dog-related problems in extreme situations. there is a need to provide support for veterinary services to carry out annual or biannual mass dog vaccination campaigns for the multiple years required to eliminate dog rabies. the additional intersectoral support provided to veterinary services can greatly improve dog rabies control program design, implementation, and sustainability. the full cost of PEP alone (direct costs of vaccine and RIG) can easily represent several months of a rural family revenue. the full cost of PEP alone (direct costs of vaccine and RIG) can easily represent several months of a rural family revenue. research on new products, especially cocktails of monoclonal antibodies, should be a priority [59]. global advocacy and enhanced awareness of the disease burden are essential to improve rabies prevention and control activities. data on disability-adjusted life year scores and economic burden models are required to compare a given condition in relation to other public health issues. the lack of priority is partly due to misconceptions about whose responsibility rabies control is. veterinary services may handle dog-related problems in extreme situations. these operations are unpopular at the local and international level and counterproductive in the short and long term. the public health sector is often the first to advocate for dog rabies control. it has to assume responsibility for human rabies deaths following exposures to rabid animals. provision of vaccines and RIG needed to prevent rabies deaths is estimated to be around 200 PEP/100,000 inhabitants. the full cost of PEP alone (direct costs of vaccine and RIG) can easily represent several months of a rural family revenue [18, 29] rabies biologics costs have been decreasing gradually due to a more competitive market, with new vaccines and RIG being produced by manufacturers based in emerging economies. significant strides have been made scientifically and practically towards eliminating canine rabies and reducing human rabies deaths in the industrialized world. the creation of effective partnerships has focused on coordinating research and operational activities related to canine rabies elimination."}
