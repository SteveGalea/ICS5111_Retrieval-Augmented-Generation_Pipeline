{"summary": "the genus Henipavirus belongs to the genus Henipavirus in the Paramyxoviridae family (1, 2). HeV and Nipah are emerging zoonotic viruses that can be transmitted from bats to humans directly or via intermediary hosts. mortality rates in humans are 40 to 75% (3). the HeV G ectodomain is divided into the stalk region (residues 71 to 188) and the globular head domain (residues 189 to 604). the cytoplasmic tail (CT), transmembrane (TM) and extracellular domains of HeV G are indicated. 293T cells were transfected with WT or mutant HeV G expression constructs. lysates were analyzed for HeV G expression by reducing (top gel) or nonreducing (bottom gel) PAGE and subsequent immunoblotting against the C-terminal HA tag in HeV G. the predicted N-glycosylation sites are mostly conserved between NiV and HeV G, except that HeV G harbors an additional predicted glycosylation site at residue 275. the potential biological roles of the actual HeV G N-glycans are currently not known. conserved asparagine-to-glutamine mutations were introduced at each predicted glycosylation site by standard site-directed mutagenesis. the sequences were verified by DNA sequencing (Eurofins, AL) the sequences were verified by DNA sequencing. 293T cells expressing WT or mutant HeV G proteins were incubated with mouse antihemagglutinin (anti-HA) antibody (1:400; Covance, PA) or a soluble recombinant mouse ephrin B2/human Fc chimera at 4\u00b0C for 1 h. the soluble mouse ephrin B2/human Fc chimera contains the ectodomain of mouse ephrin B2 bound antibody was detected using Alexa Fluor 647-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody (Life Technologies, NY) at a dilution of 1:200. 293T cells were transfected with WT HeV F and/or mutant HeV G expression plasmids and lysed in 1 radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer. the expression of only F or G was used as the negative control. cells were washed with PBS and lysed in 1.5 ml RIPA buffer. lysates were incubated with 35 l of MACS protein G MicroBeads. Western blots were imaged with the ChemiDoc XRS system (Bio-Rad, CA), and protein bands were quantified using imageLab analysis software. virions were resuspended in NTE buffer (150 mM NaCl, 40 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) luciferase activity was then measured as relative light units (RLU) using a Renilla luciferase flash assay kit (Pierce) and an Infinite M1000 microplate reader. antiserum 837 was produced against virus-like particles (VLPs) containing NiV M and HeV F and codon-optimized HeV G. tailed Student's t test was applied by comparing the results for the WT to those for each N-glycan mutant virus. expression plasmids for NiV and HeV were constructed as previously described. threonine at residue 507 increases ephrin B3 binding levels close to those of NiV. HEK293T cells (70% confluence) were transfected with wild-type (WT) HeV F and WT or mutant HeV G expression plasmids. ephrin B2 and conformational antibody binding were measured by flow cytometry. ouse antibodies were washed twice as before, fixed in 0.5% paraformaldehyde. the soluble mouse ephrin B2/human Fc chimera contains the ectodomain of mouse ephrin B2 (residues 27 to 227). PK13 cells were transfected as described above. illa luciferase reporter gene virions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. amounts of 2 109 or 5 109 virions were separated by reducing (10%) or nonreducing (8%) SDS-PAGE. half of each purified elution was separated by 10% PAGE. blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. anti-mouse AU1 antibody (1:500) and anti-rabbit HA antibody (1:2,000) virions were resuspended in NTE buffer (150 mM NaCl, 40 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) the isolated RNA was reverse transcribed using the QIAamp viral RNA minikit (Qiagen, CA) the VSV genome copy numbers were quantified by using a quantitative PCR (qPCR) TaqMan protocol. antiserum 837 was produced against virus-like particles (VLPs) containing NiV M and HeV F. the antibody/virus mixture was added to vero cells and incubated for 2 h. the cells were then incubated overnight and lysed 20 to 24 h postinfection. the sites in the HeV G head are generally located on surface-exposed loops. we mutated each of the eight predicted glycosylation sites (G1 to G7 and N275) via a conservative mutation of Asn (N) to Gln (Q) we transfected wild-type (WT) or mutant HeV G constructs into 293T cells and tested for protein expression 20 to 24 h posttransfection. removal of N-glycans in the head of HeV G enhances cell-cell fusion promotion. removal of the N-glycan in the stalk decreases it. we then tested whether N-glycosylation is important for cell-cell fusion. compared to WT HeV G (FI of 1), the G4, G6, and to a lesser extent, G3 mutants were hyperfusogenic (FIs of 1.64, 2.55, and 1.29, respectively), whereas the stalk G2 mutant was fusion dead (FI of 0.00) this indicates that changes in the stalk region (residues 72 [G1] and 159 [G2] have a profound impact on the fusion abilities of HeV G. 58 25 0.43 0.14 ND G3** 77 100 1.29 0.04 0.86 0.11 G4** 89 146 1.64 0.08 1.11 0.10 G5 70 63 0.89 0.09 0.09 0.67 0.06 G6** 43 110 2.55 0.21 6.38 0.45 G7** 75 74 0.99 0.13 1.60 0.09 G2G3 31 0 0.00 0.00 0.10 0.06 G3G4 57 120 2.11 0.25 ND G3G5 39 we analyzed whether the removal of specific N-glycans affects the binding of HeV G to its cellular receptor ephrin B2. all HeV G N-glycan mutants were able to bind soluble ephrin B2 at levels roughly corresponding to their CSE levels. this indicates that the efficiency of ephrin B2 binding is not dependent on N-glycosylation at most N-glycosylation sites in HeV double mutants ranged from 12% (G6G7) to 57% (G3G4) and were all substantially lower than the CSE levels of their individual mutant counterparts. abolishing three or more sites in HeV G further reduced CSE levels, now ranging from 0% (G3G4G5G6 mutant) to 15% (G3G4G5 mutant) a fusion-dead phenotype was observed when the G2 mutation was combined with the hyperfusogenic G3 mutation (the G2G3 mutant's FI was 0.00) the effect was even more pronounced for the G3G4G5 triple mutant, which yielded a strongly hyperfusogenic phenotype. all HeV G multiple N-glycan mutants were able to form monomeric, dimeric, and tetrameric species similarly to WT HeV G. the exception was the G2G3 mutant, which yielded a lower proportion of dimers (17 to 20%) than the WT G (32 to 56%) Pseudotyped virus carrying WT HeV G but lacking WT HeV F was used as a negative-control virus to control for nonspecific entry of virions via nonviral/cell membrane fusion mechanisms. to accurately compare viral entry levels, we determined pseudotyped VSV-rLuc virions by using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. data shown in panel A are the average results SEM from at least three independent experiments. the results of one representative experiment out of three are shown in panels B and C. the percentages of F1 cleavage were determined by densitometry. all the HeV G head mutants had close to WT HeV G viral entry levels. virions were able to enter cells at WT levels despite a hypofusogenic cell-cell fusion phenotype of the G1 mutant. virions were able to enter cells at WT levels. the virions containing the G2 mutations (G2 and G2G3 mutants) had significantly reduced proportions of dimeric G (8 to 26%) compared to its proportion for the WT (66 to 75%) or any of the other mutant G virions (59 to 75%). the results suggest that the G2 N-glycan in the HeV G stalk is crucial for proper folding of HeV G. G3G4G5 mutation in either HeV G or NiV G also affected the level of incorporation of WT F into virions. some N-glycans in the attachment protein G modulate the efficient incorporation of F into virus particles. we measured the total concentration of F (inactive precursor F0 and activated proteolytic cleavage product F1) in the cell lysate and in the eluate (IP fraction) by densitometry. we normalized the value for each mutant to the value for WT HeV G, set as 1. unoprecipitated F (IP) to the amount of total F (F0 and F1) present in the cell lysate (F IP/F lysate) the individual amounts were measured by normalizing the values for mutant HeV G to those for WT HeV G (set to 1). step 2 and 3 are spatiotemporally closely linked conformational changes. we first tested the binding of conformational antibodies to N-glycan mutants. we then calculated the relative antibody binding levels by comparing them to the corresponding cell surface expression levels for each mutant. MAb26 and MAb45 binding levels to HeV G N-glycan mutants were determined in PK13 cells in the absence (0 nM) and presence (100 nM) of soluble ephrin B2. the data represent the average results SEM from at least three independent experiments. ephrin B2 binding to WT HeV G also resulted in a roughly 2-fold increase in MAb45 binding. most N-glycan mutants showed an increase in MAb45 binding. glycan shields can protect virions from antibody neutralization. the neutralization of the G6 (P = 0.060), G7 (0.050), G3G4 (P = 0.054), and G4G7 (0 = 0.058) mutants just missed borderline statistical significance. the G3 and G4 single mutants were neutralized similarly to wild-type HeV G. the 50% inhibitory concentration of the G5 mutant was reduced by 0.5 log. the average results SEM from at least six independent experiments with triplicate wells per experiment are shown. the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) is represented by a dotted line. the HeV G attachment protein is glycosylated at six of its eight potential N-glycosylation sites. we transfected wild-type (WT) or mutant HeV G constructs into 293T cells. all constructs were expressed at levels roughly similar to the level of G. an expected mobility shift of 2 to 3 kDa could be seen for the monomeric form of all mutants except G1 and N275Q. the number of syncytial nuclei per field was normalized to the level for WT HeV fusion, which was set at 100%. fusion is dependent on cell surface expression of G. we then asked whether all HeV G mutants were efficiently transported to the cell surface (23) the other stalk mutant, the G1 mutant, displayed a hypofusogenic phenotype (FI of 0.20) even though this site appeared to be nonglycosylated. these results indicate that N-to-Q changes in the stalk region have a profound impact on the fusion abilities of HeV G. a Statistical analysis was done using the Student t test. a sample for which a valid FI could not be determined due to no or minimal surface expression; ND, not determined; CSE, cell surface expression; WT, wild type G. ephrin B2 binding is not dependent on N-glycosylation at most N-glycosylation sites in HeV G. this also shows that the N-glycan mutants' effects on cell-cell fusion were not due to aberrant levels of ephrin B2 binding. we mutated two or more N-glycosylation sites simultaneously. 293T cell surface expression (CSE) and ephrin B2 (B2) receptor binding of HeV G N-glycan double (A) and multiple mutants (C) were determined by flow cytometry using mouse anti-HA antibody (CSE) and soluble mouse ephrin B2/Fc chimera. experiments were done similarly to those described in the legend to Fig. 1D. double, triple, and quadruple N-glycan mutants analyzed had different degrees of reduction of total cell expression and CSE levels compared to those of WT HeV G. reduction in protein expression was directly proportional to the number of N-glycans removed, with the least amount of protein expression for the G3G4G5G6 quadruple mutant. fusion indices obtained for HeV G N-glycan mutants and previously published indices for NiV G N-glycan mutants are summarized in Table 1. we analyzed single and multiple N-glycan mutants of HeV G for their ability to induce viral entry into vero cells. virions were lysed 20 to 24 h postinfection and monitored for luciferase activity. cells were lysed 20 to 24 h postinfection and monitored for luciferase activity. virions produced with HeV F only or empty vector yielded viral entry levels similar to those of virions. the removal of multiple N-glycans in HeV G modulates viral entry, oligomerization, and glycoprotein incorporation into the virus. the data shown in panel A are the average results SEM from at least three independent experiments. the G1 stalk mutant pseudotyped virions were able to enter cells at WT levels despite a hypofusogenic cell-cell fusion phenotype of the G1 mutant. similar results were previously observed for the NiV G1 mutant, which indicates that viral entry and cell-cell fusion mechanisms may not necessarily be as equivalent as previously thought. the most hyperfusogenic HeV G N-glycan mutant was the G3G4G5 triple mutant. we prepared virions containing either WT NiV G or the NiV G3G4G5 mutant protein. the virion entry levels were enhanced for HeV and NiV G (WT) pseudotyped virions. lysates of 293T cells cotransfected with G and F were coimmunoprecipitated. affinity purification was directed against the HeV G HA tag. only F that directly associated with G was coimmunoprecipitated by this method. results shown in Fig. 5B and C are from at least four independent experiments. total cell lysates (lysate) and coimmunoprecipitated proteins (IP: HA) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. cell lysates from cells transfected with F or G only served as the respective negative or positive controls. we previously described three receptor-induced conformational changes in NiV G that modulate cell-cell membrane fusion (11) these three conformational steps can be detected by using three different antibodies, MAb213 or MAb26 (step 1) and MAb45 (step 2) that bind to the head region of G and Ab167 (step 3) that bind to the stalk region of G (11, 21) 2 mutants showed enhanced binding for both MAb26 and MAb45 (83% and 37% enhancement, respectively) this is different from the other double mutants, which showed reduced binding to MAb26 (28 to 42%) or MAb45 (15 to 50%) compared to the results for WT HeV G. MAb26 binding to NiV G was reduced by 70% upon ephrin B2 receptor engagement. all HeV G N-glycan mutants showed decreased MAb26 binding. this was similar to the results for WT HeV G. lycan in the stalk region of HeV G (residue 159) is crucial for the step 2 conformational change to occur. glycan shields can protect the viruses from antibody neutralization (14, 20, 30\u201334) 5 and G3G4G5 mutant virions confirm that N-glycans in HeV G provide Hendra virus with a shield to evade neutralizing antibodies. however, the degree of evasion varies among N-glycans, with the individual N-glycans having distinct effects on antibody neutralization. six of eight potential N-glycosylation sites are glycosylated (G2 to G7) in HeV G. however, there are differing reports about the existence of N-glycosylation at the HeV G5 site (residue 417), which may be due to the different expression systems used. sylation at the G2 site is of crucial importance to the life cycle of both HeV and NiV. the removal of G3 and G4 N-glycans leads to higher fusion indices for HeV G (FIs of 1.29 and 1.64, respectively) than for NiV G (FIs of 0.86 and 1.11, respectively) this effect was even more pronounced in the G3G4G5 mutant (FIs of 11.81 for HeV and 4.49 for NiV) the types of N-glycans added to equivalent N-glycosylation sites in HeV versus NiV G remain to be determined. a fusogenically inactive F0 protein undergoes endocytic recycling and proteolytic processing into the disulfide-linked F1 and F2 forms by the cellular protease cathepsin L (43). a greater number of N-glycans removed correlated with higher fusion levels. the viral incorporation levels are likely a direct reflection of the glycoprotein levels present on the cell surface, as paramyxoviruses bud from the cell surface. we previously reported an inverse correlation between fusion and F binding while analyzing hypofusogenic NiV F N-glycan mutants (20). the viral entry levels generally correlated with the cell-cell fusion levels for each mutant analyzed. conformational antibodies can detect changes in G conformations in the absence versus the presence of soluble receptor ephrin B2. these antibodies can detect changes in G conformations in the absence versus the presence of soluble receptor ephrin B2. in the pre-receptor binding state, most single N-glycan mutants bound equally well to MAb26 and MAb45. we also observed a 50% increase in MAb45 binding for the double mutant G4G5 upon receptor engagement compared to that of WT HeV G. this suggests that the removal of certain N-linked glycans may enhance conformational changes in a viral protein. however, the lower level of conformational change in the G3 mutant appears to be sufficient for both cell-cell fusion and viral entry to occur. studies of several paramyxoviruses have suggested that tetramer dissociation is important during H or G triggering. we believe that removal of the G2 N-glycan increases the interaction between the subunit stalk domains, which causes an increase in tetrameric stability. tetramer dissociation is likely important for fusion promotion. we recently reported that N-glycans in NiV G protect virions from antibody neutralization and have important roles in viral entry and cell-cell fusion (14). despite high amino acid identity, some reports suggest a level of inherent differences in the structure and/or function of NiV and HeV G glycoproteins (48, 49) our results showed important functions in modulating G cell surface expression, induction of membrane fusion, viral entry, interactions with F, and shielding against antibody neutralization. we also noted qualitative commonalities and quantitative differences between specific N-glycan functions."}
