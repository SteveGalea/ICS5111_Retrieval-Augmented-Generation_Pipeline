{"summary": "nanomaterials and nanostructures have been widely used to design new biosensors and bioelectronics. main advantage stems from their high surface area for enhanced interactions with targeted nanoscale particles. new methods and systems to detect nanoparticles have gained great attention in disease diagnostics and health monitoring. contaminated samples are inoculated onto a layer of host cells and observed for unique cytopathic effects. the major drawback is the assay time, often requiring several weeks. however, all these heavily rely on diffusion-limited biochemical amplification to indicate the presence of a virus. iffusion describes random migration of particles in a solution from high to low concentration zones. c t = D 2 c, (1) where c is the nanoparticle concentration, t is time, and D is the diffusion coefficient. this equation predicts how diffusion causes the concentration to change with time. the solid black line represents the cumulative number of hits. the dashed lines represent zone standard deviation. the estimated number of hits with the zone of one standard deviation is shown. the average number of hits (impacts) on a microwire electrode can be expressed by: N h i t s ( t ) = 2 p * l r c 2 F * ( ), where = D t / r c 2, (4) where p* is the NP concentration, l is the length of the wire, rc is the radius of the wire, and F * ( ) is a time-dependent function. diffusion-based concentration methods use capture probes that bind with target viral particles at specific points in their natural motion. most probes use either immobilized antibodies, which capture viral particles through antigen\u2013antibody interactions or DNA hybridization probes. most probes use either immobilized antibodies, which capture viral particles through antigen\u2013antibody interactions or DNA hybridization probes. the detection limit for this method was determined to be 7.8 Hemagglutination units (HAU) in a 250 L sample, with a process time of 35 min. this method detects small RNA viruses (vesicular stomatitis virus and pseudotyped Ebola) and large enveloped DNA viruses (vaccinia virus) active concentration methods are required to offer rapid and sensitive detection of viral particles via diffusion. they are grouped by their reported detection unit (1). they are required to offer rapid and sensitive detection of viral particles. 200 L 0.04 HAU/L 0.1 HAU/L (9) H3N1 [19] n/a 60 L 2 104 HAU/L [50% Tissue Culture Infective Dose (TCID)] H1N1, H3N2 [13] 40 min 90 L 102 TCID50/mL 200 TCID50/mL (10) [International Units (IU)] -HBsAg IgG antibodies [22] 5 min 25 L 3 the sedimentation phenomenon of nanoparticles via centrifugal concentration is in a non-equilibrium state due to the complex hydrodynamic process. in theory, the sedimentation phenomenon of nanoparticles via centrifugal concentration is in a non-equilibrium state due to the complex hydrodynamic process. a viral sample is centrifuged, forming a pellet of solid matter. the pellet is then re-suspended over a cushion with specific density gradient. lines projected from the illustration show corresponding TEM images of each gradient fraction. fraction 3 (10% iodixanol) showed both the highest overall WSSV infectivity and the lowest concentration of protein. microfiltration is another physical concentration process, in which a heterogeneous sample mixture is forced to pass across a membrane filter using a pump. the first step involves processing an infected water sample (10 L) through a hollow fiber ultrafiltration loop, with a pore size of 20 nm and a transmembrane pressure (TMP) of 0.2 bar. the total process time for the filtration is only 22 min, resulting in a volumetric concentration factor (VCF) of 100 with a recovery rate of 31 8%. Zhang group devised a lanthanum-based flocculation technique for reducing a 40 L MS2/adenovirus sample to 1 L prior to filtration, significantly reducing the impact of membrane contamination. they found that ultrafiltration through a 300 kDa membrane worked best, due to its ability to concentrate H1N1 particles in the retentate while also removing host cell proteins and DNA in the permeate. the aforementioned concentration methods are useful, but not ideal for simple, rapid diagnostic testing and point-of-care diagnostics due to the required large sample volume, equipment-heavy setup, and long process time. electric and magnetic fields have both been used to actively concentrate viral particles. m = ( m ) B = V p ( p f ) 2 0 B 2, (10) where m is the magnetic dipole moment, B is the external magnetic field, p and f are the volume magnetic susceptibility of the particles and the fluid, respectively, and 0 is magnetic permeability of air or vacuum. a direct current (DC) of 0.5 A is applied to the integrated microcoils, inducing a magnetic field that attracts the magnetic beads. the overall concentration time for this device is only 10 min, while traditional bio-sample preparation for RT-PCR can take up to 48 min and carries a higher contamination risk. electric field-based concentration has versatility to control particle movement directions and speed in several ways. electrophoresis (EP) describes the motion of dispersed charged particles relative to their suspension fluid under the influence of a uniform electric field. the Brownian motion-induced force (FBrownian) is caused by random thermal fluctuation in medium [64]: F B r o w n i a n = 12 r k B T t, (16) where kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute temperature of a solution. the CM factor for a sphere is: C M = p * m * p * + 2 m *, where * = + this DEP method has successfully concentrated low-abundance nanoparticles. a dendritic tip is immersed in a 2 L sample droplet opposite a metal coil. the resulting DEP force is large enough to overcome the Brownian motion of viral particles. most groups did not demonstrate a detection limit significantly lower than diffusion-based methods. Iwata group developed a method of concentrating viral RNA with sulfonated magnetic beads to reduce the detection limit as low as 102 viral copies/mL. dengue virus (DENV) [58] 10.5 min 25 L 101 pfu/L 10 pfu [genomic copies] west Nile virus, Saint Louis encephalitis virus, JEV, Western/Eastern equine encephalomyelitis viruses [77] n/a 5 L 102 RNA copies/L (2) 8\u201312 genomic copies. nanofluidic devices use fluid flow to deliver target nanoparticles in a medium via channels or pores. the Reynolds number of flow in nano-microscale structures is very small. this gives negligible inertial terms in Navier\u2013Stokes equations. Figure 4a shows particles in a fluid passing through a nanopore with different travel speeds, caused by electric field (E) the translocation velocity is increased about 100 times, compared to the lower electric field case. a 100-fold increase in electric field strength results in a 100-fold increase in speed. flow is induced in a 20 m-wide channel via capillary action. then flow is limited by evaporation, while particles that are too large to pass through the shallow outlet become trapped. this method is similar to that of microfiltration, in that each trapping interface acts like a membrane pore which limits the movement of particles too large to pass. this group was able to detect HBV from whole blood in less than thirty minutes, with a detection limit 6.5 times lower than that of real-time qPCR [34]. this work highlights the greatest advantage of LOC devices\u2014the automated integration of both passive and active process steps into a single device. microfluidic devices are suitable for integrating sample preparation and processing into a single device. the next generation of viral diagnostic tools will most likely take the form of various LOC devices. the device illustrated in Figure 5a uses functionalized magnetic nanoparticles to remove pathogens from whole blood in a manner similar to the magnetic concentration methods. this technique could reasonably be modified to target specific viral particles. flexible sensor is used to detect a change in solution conductivity. the solution conductivity is measured with integrated electrodes and used to characterize the level of infection. flexible devices can bend and stretch to accommodate the dynamic contours of a human body. c t = D 2 c, (1) where c is the nanoparticle concentration, t is time, and D is the diffusion coefficient. this equation predicts how diffusion causes the concentration to change with time. for full and irreversible adsorption, Fick\u2019s second law of diffusion can be used to develop an analytical solution in one-dimensional linear and radial space. disk diffusion test for a variety of different sized silver nanoparticles against the E. coli MTCC 443 strain. the solid black line represents the cumulative number of total hits. the dashed lines represent zone standard deviation. the average number of hits (impacts) on a microwire electrode can be expressed by: N h i t s ( t ) = 2 p * l r c 2 F * ( ), where = D t / r c 2, (4) where p* is the NP concentration, l is the length of the wire, rc is the radius of the wire, and F * ( ) is a time-dependent function. most probes use either immobilized antibodies, which capture viral particles through antigen\u2013antibody interactions or DNA hybridization probes. binding could result in viral particle aggregation [13,14,15,16,17,18,19], collection on a 2D or 3D structure [20,21,22,23,24,25,26] the detection limit for this method was determined to be 7.8 Hemagglutination units (HAU) in a 250 L sample, with a process time of 35 min. an optofluidic sensor (Figure 1f\u2013h) uses a similar principle to immobilize antibodies onto a gold-plated nanohole. this sensor detects small RNA viruses (vesicular stomatitis virus and pseudotyped Ebola) active concentration methods are required to offer rapid and sensitive detection of viral particles via diffusion.

VCF is the ratio between original starting volume and final elution volume. the recovery rate describes what percentage of the starting viral mass is present in the final elution volume. this type of filter operates using chemical binding, rather than physical exclusion. mixed viral samples could be fractionalized using a series of microfiltration steps with decreasing pore size. the aforementioned concentration methods are useful, but not ideal for simple, rapid diagnostic testing and point-of-care diagnostics. the active concentration of target particles in a medium needs to consider all forces acting on the particles. magnetic fields exert a force on ferromagnetic materials, such as iron, cobalt, and nickel [55] d r a g = 3 d p v p, (9) where is the fluid viscosity and d p is the core diameter of the particle. m = ( m ) B = V p ( p f ) 2 0 B 2, (10) where m is the magnetic dipole moment, B is the external magnetic field, p and f are the volume magnetic susceptibility of the particles and the fluid, respectively, and 0 is magnetic a recent study shows that a Fe3O4 nanoparticles in solution can be concentrated at a target electrode due to the induced magnetic field. anti-dengue antibody-conjugated magnetic beads are mixed with a viral sample and incubated for 20 s. a direct current (DC) of 0.5 A is applied to the integrated microcoils, inducing a magnetic field that attracts the magnetic beads. bead-virus constructs are concentrated via electrically induced magnetic micro coils downstream;
