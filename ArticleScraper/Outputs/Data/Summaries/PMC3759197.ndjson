{"summary": "chemotherapy, surgery and radiotherapy are the most common types of cancer treatments available nowadays. the history of chemotherapy began in the early 20th century, but its use in treating cancer began in the 1930s. nitrogen mustard was used as the first chemotherapy agent to treat lymphomas, a treatment used by Gilman in 1943. in the 1970s, advanced Hodgkin's disease was made curable with chemotherapy using the MOMP protocol [12,13], which combined nitrogen mustard with vincristine, methotrexate and prednisone. in 1975, a cure for advanced diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was reported using protocol C-MOPP, which substituted cyclophosphamide for nitrogen mustard. the 1990s sparked the beginning of targeted chemotherapy by screening for specific critical molecular targets. advances in modern chemotherapy and studies on genetics and molecular biology contributed to the ongoing decline in death rates. the current trend has been to develop kinase inhibitors [20,21] since 1990, the incidence and mortality of cancer have been declining. mortality rates for the united states declined from 2005 to 2007. in 1890, Halsted performed the first radical mastectomy, believing cancer would be more curable if surgical techniques were more aggressive. cquerel and Rontgen in the late 19th century was the first step towards radiation treatment. the first cancer case cured exclusively by radiation occurred in 1898. in 1960, Ginzton and Kaplan began to use a rotational linac radiotherapy called \u201cClinac 6\u201d. radiogenic therapy induces the formation of cytotoxic agents against cancer cells. lower doses of radiation are used along with a biological agent. stimulation by radiation produces cytotoxic agents against cancer cells. this complex technology was developed to use radiation to activate promoters. antibodies were described in 1890 as 'anti-toxins' that appeared in the serum of animals after immunization with inactivated toxins (toxoids) they are produced by B cells, which undergo differentiation to secretory (plasma) cells thus producing soluble antibodies. they are highly specific, and they recognize and eliminate pathogens and disease antigens. anti-snake venom, ant-tetanus and anti-Rh+ gamma globulins are still being used in clinical practice. in 1890 von Behring and Kitasato showed that it was possible to generate anti-toxins (against tetanous, diphtheria), and soon after, therapy with antiserum containing antitoxins were used in patients. the current classification of leukemia by the world health organization is based on the presence or absence of membrane molecules recognized by monoclonal antibodies. but one of the greatest achievements with monoclonal antibodies is their use in human therapy. surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy are not specifically directed to tumor cells and may also affect healthy tissue. chimeric antibodies carry mouse heavy and light variable domains (in yellow) being the rest of the molecule of human origin (in red) it is possible to generate bi-specific antibodies using different heavy and light chains (each arm will have a different specificity) several mAbs have been approved for therapy in the us and Europe. more than half of them are chimeric or humanized mAbs. list of monoclonal antibodies including target antigen, therapeutic or diagnostic indication, source and data of approval.

reticulo-endothelial system (RES) to increase nanoparticle systemic circulation. currently marketed nanoparticles use passive targeting and active targeted nanoparticles are still being developed. s provides a simple and scalable manufacturing strategy. s provides a simple and scalable manufacturing strategy. s provides a simple and scalable manufacturing strategy. novel targeted theragnostic nanoparticles have been synthesized and their bi-functionality demonstrated. a single-chain variable fragment antibody recognized epidermal growth factor receptor overexpressed in many types of malignant human tumors. the nanoparticles were also able to function as tags for spectroscopic detection. photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a technology that uses a photosensitizer that is activated upon exposure to visible or near infrared (NIR) light. photosensitizers absorb in the visible spectral regions below 700 nm, where light penetrates only a few millimeters into the skin. nanoparticles are four to five orders of magnitude larger than those offered by conventional photoabsorbing dyes. nanoparticles embedded in heLa cells generate singlet oxygen, resulting in a reduction in cell survival. a significant advantage of thermal technology is that it is minimally invasive. heat increases blood flow in the tumor, allowing chemotherapy to exert greater effect on cancer cells. hyperthermia is one of the most potent radiosensitizers available. magnetic energy dissipation from nanoparticles induces heating, which produces cell death at temperatures above 43 \u00b0C. magnetic hyperthermia in conjunction with a reduced radiation dose leads to longer survival following diagnosis of first tumor recurrence compared to conventional therapies in the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma [81,81]. magnetic nanoparticles encapsulated within liposomes have been designed to achieve active targeting of tumor cells by electrostatic interaction before hyperthermia doxorubicin-loaded nanoparticles were injected directly via the main hepatic artery to hepatocellular carcinoma in a rat model. the nanoparticles have the advantage of being able to absorb or scatter light, thus producing heat. this region of the electromagnetic spectrum is notable for minimal absorption by water and biological chromophores. nanoparticles are smaller than siO2/Au nanoshells thus giving them prolonged blood circulation half-life. nanorods exhibit superior spectral bandwidth, higher photothermal heat generation per gram of gold and longer circulation half-life when compared to gold nanoshells. nanoparticles have been functionalized with anti-HER2 antibodies. gene therapy aims to treat diseases by introducing DNA, RNA, small interfering RNA and antisense oligonucleotides into specific target cells or tissues. the therapeutic gene material is delivered to specific target cells using efficient vectors that aim to sustain stable, regulated gene expression without creating unwanted side effects. the most widely used viral vectors for gene transfer include adenoviruses (Ad) gene therapy systems were not fully developed until the early 1980s. the first clinical trials were approved in 1989, and during the 1990s numerous vectors carrying various therapeutic genes were engineered. the evolution of currently successful cancer strategies discussed in Sections 1 and 2 also included significant failures. since 2004 china has been the only country in the world where gene therapy is licensed for practice. these products are adenoviral vectors marketed under the brand names GendicineTM and OncorineTM. gene therapy is a p53-overexpressing, replication-incompetent Ad. p53 wild-typere protein after transduction with Advexin&trade, and phase II and III trials were conducted in unresectable recurrent squamous cell carcinoma. responders had a characteristic p53 profile, with either low expression of mutated p53 or wild-type p53 inactivated by upregulation of inhibitors. genetic immunotherapy was conceived to deliver immune mediators as an efficient and safe approach that also prevents the need to produce and purify large the ideal synthetic vector would incorporate a polycationic sequence to condense nucleic acids and a coating to evade the reticuloendothelial system. it would exhibit colloidal stabilization properties to prevent accumulation in the lung capillaries. the goal is to synthetically manufacture biodegradable vectors than can be administered systemically to reach micro metastases. a phase III trial is currently being conducted to compare the efficacy of Allovectin-7TM to conventional chemotherapy. the results were obtained in a recent Phase I trial conducted on women with recurrent, chemotherapy-resistant ovarian cancer to assess the safety and tolerability of a plasmid carrying the human gene for interleukin-12 plasmid. inorganic nanoparticles are under development despite low synthesis efficiency. magnetic liposomes have also been tested in magnetic hyperthermia settings to induce therapeutic TNF- expression driven by the promoter of the stress-inducible gadd153 gene. targeted cancer therapies nanoparticles are engineered to achieve cell targeting by using selective moieties (e.g., antibodies and their fragments, carbohydrates, peptides, nucleic acids) the rapid cellular proliferation of these cells is also exploited by coupling the nanoparticles with different biological agents, such as folic acid. single-step synthesis of targeted nanoparticles by self-assembling pre-functionalized biomaterials provides a simple and scalable manufacturing strategy. single-step synthesis of targeted nanoparticles by self-assembling pre-functionalized biomaterials is also a serious concern. new targeted theragnostic nanoparticles have been synthesized and their bi-functionality demonstrated. the nanoparticles were also able to function as tags for spectroscopic detection with surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy. targeting of prodrugs that become active once they reach tumor cells is another novel strategy for avoiding unwanted side effects of the drug. a complete review of photosensitizers is reported elsewhere. photosensitizers are susceptible to photobleaching under light irradiation. nanoparticles are loaded into nanoparticles to increase bioavailability. nanoparticles are being explored as carriers to increase bioavailability. heat causes irreparable damage and results in tumor cell death. hyperthermia treatments make use of microwaves, ultrasounds and radiofrequency. heat increases blood flow in the tumor, allowing chemotherapy to exert greater effect. magnetic nanoparticles for hyperthermia settings show the advantage of being able to achieve site-specific tumor targeting through the aid of an external magnetic field. magnetic energy dissipation from the nanoparticles induces heating, which produces cell death at temperatures above 43 \u00b0C. phase I and II clinical trials using magnetic particles have been conducted to treat prostate carcinoma [79] and glioblastoma multiforme [80,81]. magnetic hyperthermia has been demonstrated as feasible in combinatorial approaches for cancer treatment. nanoparticles coated with a thermoresponsive polymer poly-n-isopropylacrylamide have the advantage of being able to absorb or scatter light. this region of the electromagnetic spectrum is notable for minimal absorption by water and biological chromophores. Au/AuS sulfide nanoparticles (35\u201355 nm) provide higher absorption than nanoshells. hollow gold nanoparticles are smaller than siO2/Au nanoshells. other nanoparticles used in NIR include hollow gold nanoparticles. despite increasing number of newly developed nanoparticles designed for hyperthermia applications, the number of studies addressing their toxicity is low. despite the increasing number of newly developed nanoparticles designed for hyperthermia applications, the number of studies addressing their toxicity is low. the concept of gene therapy was initially envisioned in the 1970s. but due to the cumbersome nature of the testing required to design and produce effective and safe vectors, gene therapy systems were not fully developed until the early 1980s. many of these viral vectors rapidly moved to clinical settings. oncolytic viruses have been engineered that exploit tumor cells characteristics by replicating them in these target cells. since 2004 china has been the only country in the world where gene therapy is licensed for practice. both of these products have been approved for cancer treatment in china. inTM is a replication-impaired, adenoviral vector carrying the p53 tumor suppressor gene under the control of a constitutive viral promoter. many human cancers have abnormalities in some of the molecules associated with the p53 pathway, contributing to tumor resistance to a variety of conventional therapeutics. d vector is encoding a dominant negative mutant of the human cyclin G1 gene, which makes it lethal to cancer cells. the ideal synthetic vector would incorporate a polycationic sequence to condense nucleic acids and a coating to evade the reticuloendothelial system. it would exhibit colloidal stabilization properties to prevent accumulation in the lung capillaries, and would contain specific target-cell entry, endosomal escape and nuclear localization signals. allovectin-7TM is a promising cancer gene therapy product. contains a bicistronic plasmid encoding human leukocyte antigen-B7 and beta-2 microglobulin. this plasmid allows the immune system to recognize metastatic melanoma lesions as foreign by incorporating a MHC class I complex into the tumor through direct injection. nanocarriers have been used in vivo to deliver plasmid DNA encoding for the soluble form of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (VEGF-R1 or sFlt-1) in anti-angiogenic therapy. nanoparticles also offer the ability to monitor the delivery of genetic material. nanoparticles also offer the ability to monitor the delivery of genetic material. nanotechnology has engineered powerful non-biological carriers of a variety of therapeutic genes that have demonstrated efficacy and safety in preclinical tests. clinical trials with these synthetic systems are expected to suffer similar drawbacks in terms of efficacy as those experienced with viral gene therapy systems."}
