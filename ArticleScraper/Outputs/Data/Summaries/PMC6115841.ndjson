{"summary": "the occurrence of OTA or OTA toxigenic fungi has been detected in cereals and animal feeds worldwide [4,5,6,7,8,9,10] OTA is a critical mycotoxin that causes various harmful effects in animals and humans. OTA is classified as a group 2B agent (possible human carcinogen) poultry, OTA also decreases the sizes of central lymphoid organs, including the thymus and bursa of Fabricius [22,23], which produce T and B cells. OTA has been shown to affect the humoral response in chicks by altering the levels of specific antibody titers in response to sheep red blood cells or viruses. serum levels using ELISAs in chicks consuming 0.1 mg OTA/kg diet. results provided important insights into the effects of OTA on the central lymphoid organs and immune responses in chicks. relative weights of the bursa and thymus were significantly decreased in all OTA-treated groups compared with the control group (p 0.05). however, the relative spleen weight was significantly decreased only at higher dose of OTA (0.9 and 1.1 mg OTA/kg feed) treated groups. s was increased in chicks fed with 0.7 mg OTA/kg or more compared with those in the control group. no differences in eosinophil levels were detected (p > 0.05) IgA levels were significantly decreased in all groups consuming OTA-contaminated feed. the relative weights of the bursa, thymus, and the spleen were significantly decreased only at higher dose of OTA (0.9 and 1.1 mg OTA/kg feed) treated chicks. total circulating leukocyte concentrations or percentages of lymphocytes, monocytes, or heterophils were significantly reduced in chicks treated with 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, and 1.1 mg OTA/kg feed. lymphocytes were significantly reduced in OTA-treated chicks (0.5, 0.7, 0.9, and 1.1 mg OTA/kg feed) mycotoxin OTA induces immunosuppression, and prolonged exposure to OTA at low doses have more significant effects on the immune system than acute exposure at high doses. OTA-induced toxicity may have a greater impact during early life, when the immune system is not fully developed and when many vaccines are often administered. reduction in spleen\u2019s size was observed only for chicks consuming 0.9 mg OTA/kg feed. reduced leukocyte numbers were detected in animals consuming 0.3\u20131.1 mg OTA/kg feed. reduced percentage of lymphocytes may have been related to increased heterophil and monocyte percentage. bartlomiej et al. also found decreased levels of serum total protein. inhibition of protein synthesis by OTA may be due to its effects on phenylalanine t-RNA synthase and phenylalanine hydroxylase. experimental chicks were kept under strict hygienic conditions and maintained on broiler mash from day 1 until the end of the experiment. OTA-contaminated feed OTA was resuspended in ethanol. all chicks had access to fresh water and feed ad libitum for 21 days. all animal experiments were conducted according to the rules and regulations of the animal care and ethics committee. s, eosinophils, and monocytes were quantified using an autoanalyzer. the measurements were carried out with a spectrophotometer using commercially available kits (Diasys Diagnostic system GmbH, Holzheim, Germany) experimental design On day 1, chicks were divided into seven groups. control group was provided a feed that was not contaminated. experimental groups were provided an OTA-contaminated feed. animals were kept at 33 \u00b0C for the first week, at 32 \u00b0C for the second week. all the chicks from each group were slaughtered by the half neck method. the bursa of Fabricius, the thymus, and the spleen were weighed separately. the respective weights relative to the total body weights were calculated."}
