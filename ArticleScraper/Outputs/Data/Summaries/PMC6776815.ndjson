{"summary": "5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemotherapy is the standard first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer. regimens include 5-FU plus leucovorin plus oxaliplatin (FOLFOX), 5-FU plus leucovorin plus irinotecan (FOLFIRI) or 5-FU plus oxaliplatin plus irinotecan (FOLFOXIRI) infusional versus bolus 5-FU-induced coronary vasospasm can cause myocardial ischemia manifesting as angina. symptoms can be less pronounced, or clinically silent, with 5-FU infusion. experts advise against re-challenge with 5-FU following cardiac toxicity. infusional 5-FU re-challenge in patients with suspected coronary vasospasm carries a higher clinical risk in the unmonitored setting. a 69-year-old male with a past medical history significant for osteoarthritis, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary bypass graft 3 years prior underwent screening colonoscopy. leucovorin 400 mg/m2 IV over 2 hours, then 5-FU 1,200 mg/m2/day continuous infusion over 23 hours for two doses (total of 2,400 mg/m2/cycle); each cycle repeated every 2 weeks. symptoms included mild fever, rhinorrhea, nausea, and severe headache. the patient tested positive for coronavirus on nasopharyngeal wash obtained for fever and rhinorrhea workup. a clinical diagnosis of coronary vasospasm was made. the patient tolerated the second cycle without complications. oxaliplatin exhibited signs of hypersensitivity in cycles 10 and 11, characterized by transient tachycardia and mild hypoxemia during the oxaliplatin administration. maintenance capecitabine was initiated during an inpatient stay at a reduced dose of 310 mg/m2 orally twice daily (approximately a 50% dose reduction) the patient was discharged after 48 hours of monitoring. a significant caveat to re-challenge with infusional 5-FU over bolus is the temporal unpredictability of vasospasm symptoms in relation to dosing. a small non-randomized study (58 patients) gave verapamil to patients receiving infusional 5-FU for the primary prophylaxis of coronary vasospasm. only one case report of successful bolus 5-FU re-challenge exists in the literature. infusional 5-FU is more active than bolus (9), safe re-challenge with infusional 5-FU is desirable in the metastatic setting."}
