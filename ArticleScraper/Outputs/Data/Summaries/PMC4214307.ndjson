{"summary": "the case was reported to the unknown pathogen Discovery/investigation group. sputum and blood specimens were negative for adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, coronaviruses, metapneumovirus, influenza virus, parainfluenza viruses 1\u20132, varicella-zoster virus, Epstein-Barr virus, parvovirus, enterovirus, and rhinovirus. the hot water faucet provided boiled water at 95\u00b0\u00ad100\u00b0C. cold water faucet provided unboiled water that was treated by a built-in reverse osmosis device. both strains were sequence type 1032 (12) serogroup 1 (ST1), TMTC Hot water source of the hot/cold water dispenser ND Negative Tap water source 1 in maternity ward ND Negative Tap water source 4 in maternity ward ND Negative Tap water source for bathing in infant\u2019s house ND Negative Tap water source for drinking water in infant\u2019s home ND Negative *Both case-patients were delivered by cesarean section. 3 of the 175 infants had fever within the first month of life. no Legionella infection was identified in any neonate born after the patient\u2019s birth in hospital A during the following 8 months. testing of related environmental water specimens for Legionella spp. by culture was negative for all specimens except that from the cold water source of the hot and cold water dispenser in hospital B. the water dispenser in the nursery consisted of a tank containing boiled, hot water and another tank containing cool water pipelined from the boiled water tank. both strains were sequence type 1 and were sequence type 1. hot and cold water dispensers are used in many hospitals in Taiwan. we speculate the complicated pipeline system and inappropriate maintenance of water dispensers might increase the risk for Legionella colonization."}
