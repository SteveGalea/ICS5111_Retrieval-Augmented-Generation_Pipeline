{"summary": "the most important cytoplasmic pathogen recognition receptors toward RNA virus are retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) (1, 2). both contain a DExD/H-box RNA helicase domain that directly senses viral RNA (3). hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease NS3/4A cleaves MAVS at position 508 (cysteine), resulting in the dislocation of the N-terminal fragment of MAVS from the mitochondria. several viruses inhibit MAVS-mediated signaling by degradation of MAVS. paramyxovirus V proteins hijack the DDB1-Cul4A ubiquitin ligase complex to degrade STATs, the transcription factors which are essential for IFN signaling. oncolytic NDV can selectively replicate in tumor cells and serve as a potential oncolytic agent. the results showed that a significant degradation of endogenous MAVS was detected at 18 and 24 h after NDV Herts/33 infection. NDV degrades MAVS in a multiplicity of infection (MOI)-dependent manner. the results showed that NDV also degraded MAVS in A549 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. mRNA levels of IFN- and downstream interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1 (IFIT1) were investigated. as expected, NDV infection induced high mRNA levels of both IFN- and IFIT1 at 12, 18, and 24 hpi and peaked at 18 hpi.

NDV V protein inhibited poly(IC)-mediated IFN- activation in a dose-dependent manner.

HEK-293T cells were cotransfected with either HA-MAVS or pRK-HA empty vector. lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody and analyzed by immunoblotting. a reverse immunoprecipitation experiment was performed with anti-Flag antibody. further confirmed that V was the protein specifically interacting with MAVS. HA-MAVS was cotransfected with wild-type (WT) Flag-V. deletion of DM2 completely abrogated the interaction between V and MAVS. HA-MAVS (aa 360 to 540) specifically interacted with V. HEK-293T cells were cotransfected with HA-MAVS and either empty vector or HA-MAVS. expression levels of the proteins were analyzed by immunoblot analysis of the lysates with anti-HA, anti-Flag, or anti-actin antibody. HEK-293T cells were cotransfected with HA-MAVS and either empty vector, WT, or truncated Flag-V. at 24 hpt, cells were harvested, immunoprecipitated with anti-HA, anti-flag, or anti-actin antibody. expression levels of the proteins were analyzed by immunoblot analysis of the lysates with anti-HA, anti-flag, or anti-actin antibody. the ubiquitination sites of MAVS are located in the region of aa 360 to 513 of MAVS. we then constructed MAVS mutants in which the lysine residues were mutated to alanines individually or simultaneously. the lysine residues were mutated to alanines individually or simultaneously. expression levels of the proteins were analyzed by immunoblot analysis of the lysates with anti-HA, anti-flag, or anti-actin antibody. at 24 hpt, cells were harvested, immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody, and further detected using immunoblot analysis with anti-ubiquitin antibody. HEK-293T cells were cotransfected with Flag-V and HA-tagged RNF5, MARCH5, Smurf1, or MUL1. at 24 hpt, cells were harvested, immunoprecipitated with anti-IgG or anti-flag antibody. expression levels of the proteins were analyzed by immunoblot analysis. cells were harvested at 12 hpt with poly(IC) (20 g/ml; wedge) at 12 hpt, cells were transfected with poly(IC) cells were detected using immunoblot analysis with anti-MAVS, anti-RNF5, anti-flag, or anti-actin antibody. MARCH5, Smurf1, and Smurf2 investigated their ability to interact with NDV V. results showed that only RNF5 was associated with V. DM2 V significantly increased the interaction between MAVS and RNF5. the expression of V and the obvious degradation of MAVS were observed in WT ZJ1-infected cells. the NDV titers in the supernatant of WT ZJ1-infected cells were 10.5- and 30.4-fold higher than that of V ZJ1-infected cells at 18 and 24 hpi. the replication curves of WT ZJ1 and V ZJ1 in WT and mavs/ cells were determined. compared virus titers in the WT ZJ1-infected cell supernatants. knockout of RNF5 significantly impaired virus infection. cells were harvested at 6, 12, 18, and 24 hpi and detected using immunoblot analysis with anti-MAVS, anti-NP, anti-V, or anti-actin antibody. the extracellular virus yields in the WT ZJ1 or V ZJ1 infection group were detected as TCID50 on DF-1 cells. -1 cells were transfected with either empty vector or flag-tagged V of NDV, NDV DM2, measles virus, sendia virus, Hendra virus, mumps virus, and parainfluenza virus type 5 (PIV5). other paramyxovirus V proteins also possess the capability for MAVS degradation. blot analysis with anti-MAVS, anti-Flag, or anti-actin antibody shows intensity band ratio of MAVS to -actin normalized to the control condition. data are presented as means from three independent experiments. V-deficient NDV attenuated MAVS degradation, upregulated IFN- production, and decreased virus late-stage proliferation. we found that NDV V proteins from other paramyxoviruses also degraded MAVS and blocked downstream signaling. paramyxovirus P and W proteins also possess the ability to impair the poly(IC)-triggered IFN signaling pathway in a MAVS-independent manner. the deletion of C-terminal DM2 abrogated the interaction between V and MAVS, indicating the C terminus of V protein was necessary for interferon induction. previous reports indicated that both the N-terminal CARD and the N-terminal CARD were involved. -like domain and the C-terminal TM domain are essential for MAVS signaling. the TM domain is usually targeted by viruses for cleavage. deletion of either the CARD or TM domain did not abolish the interaction between V and MAVS, indicating that these functional domains were not involved in V-mediated MAVS degradation. mediated degradation of MAVS at Lys7 and Lys500 and modulates MAVS-mediated antiviral signaling (44) only the HECT domain E3 ligase AIP4 has been identified to be involved in virus-mediated MAVS degradation. previous report identified that RNF5 targeted MAVS at Lys362 and Lys461 for K48-linked ubiquitination and degradation (36) dsRNA-dependent protein kinase R (PKR) is obviously activated by dsRNA generated by NDV infection and leads to IFN- production (45). dsRNA-dependent protein kinase R (PKR) is obviously activated by dsRNA generated by NDV infection and leads to IFN- production. the faster replication rate of WT ZJ1 leads to stronger innate immune activation at the early stage of infection. however, the increase of IFN in the WT ZJ1 infection group was decelerated and even decreased at the late stage of infection (18 to 24 hpi), accompanied by the expression of V, targeting MAVS for degradation, and finally impairing IFN signaling. a new mechanism of paramyxovirus V-mediated evasion of the host\u2019s innate immunity was explored. wortmannin (W1628; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and chloroquine (C6628; Sigma-Aldrich) were used at 25 M. horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or -mouse secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA, USA) titers on DF-1 cells were determined as median tissue culture infective doses (TCID50) as described previously (51). flag-tagged MAVS, flag-tagged TBK1, and HA-tagged wide-type and deletion constructs of MAVS were provided by Z.
