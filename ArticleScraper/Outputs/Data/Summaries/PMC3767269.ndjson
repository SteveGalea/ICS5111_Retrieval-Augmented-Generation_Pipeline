{"summary": "emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) may include new, previously undefined diseases. new features may include the introduction of a disease to a new location or a new population. new clinical features may include resistance to available treatments, or a rapid increase in the incidence and spread of the disease. by September 2009, nearly all countries had reported H1N1 virus to the world health organization, with more than 17,000 deaths. of which, 12,000 were in the united states alone. these two examples highlight the risks and underscore the need to improve preparedness at national and international levels. newer and hitherto unknown set of infectious diseases are on a rise10. emergence of drug resistance such as multidrug resistant (MDR) and extensively drug resistant (XDR) tuberculosis, malaria resistant to artemisinin-combination therapy (ACT) is new global challenges requiring concerted efforts. a literature survey identified 1,407 species of human pathogens. 37 per cent of emerging and re-emerging pathogens are viruses and prions followed by protozoa (25%) this indicates that emerging and re-emerging pathogens are disproportionately viruses11. many infections are associated with poor sanitation, contaminated food, inadequate personal hygiene, or access to safe water. over the years increase in cases of drug resistant malaria, tuberculosis, HIV-TB co-infections and epidemics of avian influenza have demonstrated the vulnerability of India to evolving microbes. the national centre for disease control has identified four sylvatic foci in india. the tri-junction of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, later Beed belt in Maharashtra, Rohru in Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand25. diphtheria, a vaccine preventable disease during 1980 was about 39,231, it reduced to 2817 cases in 1997. hra Pradesh, assam, Maharashtra, Chandigarh, Gujarat33,34,35,36,37. majority of cases were reported from children unimmunized or partially immunized against diphtheria. the virus was first recognized in 1999 during an outbreak among pig farmers in Malaysia. chikungunya fever, caused by the chikungunya virus, was first reported in Tanzania in 1953. previous outbreaks in India (1963 and 1973) were caused by the Asian genotypes. virus resulted in emergence of 'novel' Z strain, contrary to earlier belief that avian influenza virus cannot infect human beings. 587 persons have been infected by the virus with 346 deaths from 15 countries53. the geographic range of CCHF virus is the most extensive among the tickborne viruses that affect human health. acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) characterized by fever and seizures each year takes a heavy toll in a few States of India. strategies and response capacities in the country will continue to challenge public health infrastructure, test credibility of health services, and threaten to devastate health and economic development. the WHO63 has made several recommendations for national strategies including the need to strengthen epidemic preparedness and rapid response, public health infrastructure, risk communication, research and its utilization. a wide network of epidemiologists, microbiologists and entomologists has been made available in all districts and state headquarters under IDSP. each district now has a surveillance unit and a rapid response team (RRT) to quickly manage the disease outbreak in any part of the country. the epidemic disease act 1897 has been invoked by various states of India to tackle the challenges of communicable diseases like pandemic HINI influenza68. a three month regional FETP for WHO-SEAR region is being organized in NCDC each year for senior and middle level health professionals from regional countries69. the government of india created a new department of health research in ministry of health and family welfare in 2007. it is mandated to provide technical support in dealing with epidemics and natural calamities and development of tools for prevention. the department has specific programmes focusing on emerging and re-emerging diseases such as identification of agent; development of diagnostic tests. the central council of health and family welfare (CCHFW) is the apex political and policy formulating body. in 1995, the Council recommended establishment of State and district level epidemiological units and revitalization of procedures of identification and reporting of outbreaks through the primary health care system. in 1996, the National Apical Advisory Committee for National Disease Surveillance and Response System (NAAC) was created65. the aim is to ensure public health through the prevention of disease spread across borders, with limited interference to international traffic and trade. countries were only required to notify WHO of yellow fever, cholera and plague outbreaks under the IHR. the programme takes in medical graduates with an MBBS degree70. it trains public health leaders while providing epidemiologic services to health authorities in india71. a new mentorship driven two year inservice training programme is announced by the government of India. ICMR has a network of institutes devoted to specific infectious diseases and a chain of regional centres. in late 1990s the ICMR stepped up its funding in communicable diseases, accelerating research inputs for emerging infections75. the Integrated Disease Surveillance Project (IDSP) was established in 2004 in 101 districts66. each district now has a surveillance unit and a rapid response team (RRT) to quickly manage the disease outbreak in any part of the country. india has been implementing various provisions of the IHR to enhance national and thereby global public health security. the epidemic disease act 1897 has been invoked by various states of India to tackle the challenges of communicable diseases like pandemic HINI influenza68. under the IDSP, 50 district public health laboratories are being strengthened all over the country. the network would allow access to quality public health laboratory services for selected linked districts. the government of India created a new department of health research in Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in 2007. a comprehensive national strategy on infectious diseases should be in place. identification of national centres of excellence and their capacity building is of critical importance. concerted efforts are also needed to develop advanced countermeasures."}
