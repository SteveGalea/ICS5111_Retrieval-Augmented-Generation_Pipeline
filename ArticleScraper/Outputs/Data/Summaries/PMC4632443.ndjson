{"summary": "nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a condition in which excessive fat accumulates in the liver of a patient who does not have a history of alcohol abuse. steatosis (a primary insult) can sensitize the liver to secondary serious insults including reactive oxygen/nitrogen species, gut-derived endotoxins, pro-inflammatory cytokines like tumor necrosis factor-alpha. ic components in L. japonica are chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, flavoyadorinin-B, methyl chlorogenate, and protocatechuic acid. chlorogenic acid has been officially used as the indicator compound to characterize the quality of this herb. since 1995, Lonicera japonica has been listed in the Pharmacopoeia of the People\u2019s Republic of China. the study investigated the hepatotherapeutic effect of L. japonica in an animal model of methionine- and choline-deficient diet (MCDD)-induced hepatic injury. it has been documented that ciprofibrate at the daily oral dosage of 10 mg/kg was effective to ameliorate hyperlipidemia in hypertriglyceridemic mice. the L. japonica ethanol extract (LJEE) was evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure to completely eliminate alcohol and lyophilized, yielding approximately 582 g of dry residue. the content of chlorogenic acid in the samples was then analyzed using the Agilent 1100 HPLC system. a group of eight mice was dosed by oral gavage once per day. a group of MCDD-fed mice (n = 8) received 1.5 ml/kg distilled water only. animals were weighed, fasted for 12 h and sacrificed under intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (20 mg/kg) blood samples were centrifuged at 2000 g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. plasma was removed and placed into aliquots for analyses. kits for determination of plasma alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase concentrations were purchased from Teco Diagnostics. each liver tissue was homogenized (10% w/v) in 25 mmol/L Tris\u2013HCl pH7.4. the supernatant aliquots were stored at 70 \u00b0C until assay. each tube was then placed in a boiling water bath for 15 min. Western Blotting Liver samples were homogenized for 30 min in ice-cold radioimmune protection assay lysis buffer (50 mmol/L Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 1 mg/mL leupeptin, 50 mmol/L sodium fluoride, 1 mmol/L sodium ortho the level of -actin was estimated for equal loading of sample. membranes were washed three times with Tris-buffered saline Tween 20 (TBST) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. samples were treated with DNase (Promega; Madison, WI, USA) for 20 min at 37 \u00b0C in a GeneAmp 9700 Thermal Cycler. the remainder of the cDNA was stored at 20 \u00b0C. mRNA expression was measured by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in a fluorescent temperature Lightcycler 480. threshold cycle (Ct) value relative to controls using delta-delta Ct method. agarose gel electrophoresis confirms the presence of a single amplicon of the expected size. the flowering aerial parts of L. japonica were air-dried, pulverized to a coarse powder in a mechanical grinder. ethanol extract (LJEE) was evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure to completely eliminate alcohol and lyophilized, yielding approximately 582 g of dry residue. the MCDD and the methionine- and choline-sufficient diet were purchased from Dyets Inc. (#518810 and #518754, respectively; Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, PA, USA) both diets contained similar nutrients except methionine and choline were not included in the MCDD. a group of MCDD-fed mice (n = 8) and a group of MCSD-fed mice (n = 8) received 1.5 ml/kg distilled water only over the same treatment period. animals were weighed, fasted for 12 h, and sacrificed under intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (20 mg/kg) all experimental assays were carried out according to the manufacturers\u2019 instruction. liver samples were homogenized with chloroform/methanol (1:2, 3.75 mL) and mixed well with chloroform (1.25 mL) and distilled water (1.25 mL) the lower clear organic phase was transferred into a new glass tube and then lyophilized. each tube was then placed in a boiling water bath for 15 min. after cooling to room temperature, the absorbance was measured at 532 nm. the liver fragment slides were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. equal protein amounts (50 g) were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electro-transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. membranes were then blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin and probed with primary antibodies against extra cellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK 1/2; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) total RNA was extracted from 100-mg frozen liver samples using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen; Boston, MA, USA) RNA was quantified by A260, and its integrity verified by agarose gel electrophoresis using ethidium bromide for visualization. CYP 2E1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), transforming growth factor (TGF)-, -smooth muscle actin (SMA), type I collagen (collagen I), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)2 and MMP9. each sample was run and analysed in duplicate. MCDD-fed mice were treated with ciprofibrate (300 mg/kg/day) similar results were found for MCDD-fed mice that were treated with ciprofibrate (Table 2).

MCDD-fed mice had 32.8% lower JNK phosphorylation in liver than their vehicle-treated counterparts. ciprofibrate suppressed the hepatic JNK phosphorylation of p38 in the livers. no alteration in total hepatic ERK, JNK, and/or p38 contents has occurred among different groups. hepatic lipogenesis is increased in hepatic steatosis, which may result from increased TG synthesis, or decreased fatty acid oxidation. DGAT2 is a microsomal enzyme that joins acyl-CoA to 1,2-diacylglycerol and thus constitutes the final step in TG biosynthesis [23]. PPAR plays a central role in the uptake and -oxidation of fatty acids. hepatic steatosis increases liver susceptibility to more serious insults. oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids can increase lipid peroxidation. TNF is an inflammatory cytokine that plays a major role in the progression from steatosis to NASH. the most important one is TGF-, which plays a pivotal role in hepatic fibrogenesis through hepatic stellate cell activation. p38 activation did show a clear association with the benefit effect of LJEE to attenuate hyperglycemia-affected renal dysfunction [15], our data showed that activation of p38 was affected by neither MCDD nor the LJEE administration. it has been reported that ERK MAPK pathway is not involved in MCDD-induced NASH, however its activation is reported to decrease DGAT2 expression."}
