{"summary": "20 percent and 35% of obstetric practice Web sites had information posted about Zika virus in January 2016 and August 2016 respectively. in August, the most frequently observed Zika virus\u2013related content themes were the use of insect repellent (14%) and travel advisories (14%). healthgrades.com is a publicly available database of health care providers in the united states. the required number of practice Web sites per state was predetermined as a proportion of the providers listed in that state compared with the total number of providers listed in that state. practice Web sites were reviewed again from august 8, 2016 to august 15, 2016. data collection was purposely initiated 9 to 10 days after significant events related to the Zika virus outbreak. the delay prior to data collection was included to allow adequate time for practices to have considered posting or updating Zika virus\u2013related information on their Web sites. the majority of practices were categorized as \u201cOB/GYN\u201d only (n = 393; 43%) followed by practices with a nonuniversity hospital affiliation (n = 293; 32%) more practices had Facebook accounts (n = 633) linked to their practice Web sites than had Twitter accounts (n = 433) the proportion of practices posting zika virus information decreased between the 2 time points (Facebook: 15% of practices posted in January vs 9% in August; Twitter: 12% posted in January vs 8% in August). TABLE 4. Location of zika Virus information Posted on Obstetric Practice Web sites in January 2016 and August 2016. practices affiliated with hospital systems were significantly more likely to post Zika virus information in any location during both the January and August data collection periods. there was no significant association between posting and multispecialty practices during either data collection period. aZika virus information includes zika virus content posted on the Web site or on social media. only 36% of sampled practices were utilizing their Web sites to disseminate information. the proportion of practices posting Zika virus information decreased by 6% and 4% in the case of Facebook and Twitter. this decrease could be a cause for concern as the onset of non-travel-associated transmission drastically increases the at-risk population within the united states. public health organizations developing resources for providers to disseminate to their patients should be mindful of this inequity. the most well-designed patient-centered public health communication materials may never be used by the majority of providers if posting the content on their Web sites is not easy. data collection was strictly limited to what was available on practice Web sites and linked social media accounts during the specified time periods. obstetric care providers go to great lengths to create useful guidance documents and risk communication tools for a variety of audiences. public health organizations go to great lengths to create useful guidance documents and risk communication tools for a variety of audiences. despite this, there must be greater recognition of the value information gains in the eyes of the patient when it is validated by their own provider."}
