{"summary": "face shield is classified as personal protective equipment (PPE) that provides barrier protection to the facial area and related mucous membranes. millions of potential users of face shields include healthcare workers, dental providers, veterinary care personnel, laboratory workers, pre-hospital emergency medical providers, police, firefighters, and custodial staff dealing with spills and contaminated waste. face shields are designed, tested, and manufactured in accordance with the American National Standards Institute (ANSI)/International Safety Equipment Association (ISEA) Z.87.1\u20132010 standard. the majority of eye and face protection currently used in the united states is designed, tested, and manufactured. polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG) and come in disposable, reusable, and replaceable models. polycarbonate and propionate offer better optical quality that aids in reducing eye strain associated with face shield wear. some models come with built-in goggles that areTable 1. face shield frames used in healthcare are generally made of lightweight plastic. a number of manufacturers offer detachable frames for easy change-out of the face shield visor. some models also incorporate a brow cap into the frame that affords additional splash protection in the forehead region. research face shields provide a barrier to acutely-expelled aerosols of body fluids. they are commonly used as an alternative to goggles as they confer protection to a larger area of the face. but little is known about the effectiveness of face shields in preventing transmission of viral respiratory diseases. mansour III et al.[18] used a mannequin head to study eye (conjunctival) contamination during performance of a femoral osteotomy. found 30% incidence of contamination when using a combination surgical mask with integral eye shield (visor) and 3% for disposable plastic glasses. the nonuse of face shields by nurses resulted in a greater than three-fold increased risk of infection. there is a need for further research into the protection from infectious airborne pathogens afforded by face shields either worn alone or in conjunction with other PPE worn simultaneously. there is currently no universal standard for face/eye protection from biological hazards. face shields do not protect fully from impact hazards, so that OSHA requires their use in conjunction with additional eye protection. no standards currently exist regarding performance standards, but the ISEA Eye and Face Protection Group has initiated development of a voluntary standard. the Ohio State Dental Board guidelines for infection control states that dental healthcare workers need not wear medical/surgical masks when wearing an appropriate face shield. the organization for safety, asepsis, and protection advises that use of a face shield alone for protection from contamination by body fluids is likely insufficient. face shields are meant to be used as barrier protection for the facial area and associated mucous membranes from airborne body fluids expelled. the selection of the most appropriate face shield model(s) will depend on the circumstances of exposure, other PPE used concurrently, and personal vison needs. visors treated for anti-glare, anti-static, and anti-fogging properties should be full face length. outer edges of the face shield should reach at least to the point of the ear. chin and forehead protectors should be of sufficient dimensions to ensure there is adequate space between the wearer's face and the inner surface of the visor. face shields are not meant to function as primary respiratory protection. they should not be used alone because aerosols can flow behind the visor. a protective facemask (medical/surgical mask, N95 FFR, etc.) should be worn concurrently. face shields should not be used as solitary face/eye protection, but rather as adjunctive to other PPE (protective facemasks, goggles, etc.) scientifically sound research needs to be conducted on the use of this form of PPE."}
