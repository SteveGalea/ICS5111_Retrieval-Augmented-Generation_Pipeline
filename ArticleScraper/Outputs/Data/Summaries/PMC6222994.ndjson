{"summary": "PEDV is an acute and highly contagious enteric disease caused by PED virus. characterized by vomitting, watery diarrhea and fatal dehydration with high mortality in sucking piglets of one week of age. functional protein that contributes to this event remains unclear. expression of S1 protein from wild-type strain BJ2011 and cell-adapted strain CV777 could also induce apoptosis in transfected cells. apoptosis suggests S1 is an effective inducer in coronavirus-induced cell apoptosis."}{"summary": "PEDV is an acute and highly contagious enteric disease caused by PED virus. characterized by vomitting, watery diarrhea and fatal dehydration with high mortality in sucking piglets of one week of age. functional protein that contributes to this event remains unclear. expression of S1 protein from wild-type strain BJ2011 and cell-adapted strain CV777 could also induce apoptosis in transfected cells. apoptosis suggests S1 is an effective inducer in coronavirus-induced cell apoptosis."}
