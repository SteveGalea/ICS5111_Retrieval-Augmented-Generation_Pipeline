that there is a difference between measurements that monitor the numbers or volume of autophagic elements at any stage of the autophagic process versus those that measure flux through the autophagy pathway. a block in macroautophagy that results in autophagy accumulation must be differentiated from stimuli that increase autophagic activity. the appropriate assays depend in part on the question being asked and the system being used. we strongly recommend the use of multiple assays to monitor autophagy. this is because of the potential for pleiotropic effects due to blocking autophagy through genetic manipulation. there are no absolute criteria for determining autophagic status that are applicable in every biological or experimental context. this is because some assays are inappropriate, problematic or may not work at all in particular cells, tissues or organisms. autophagy is a highly dynamic, multi-step process. it can be modulated at several steps, both positively and negatively. inefficient fusion with endosomes and/or lysosomes, or perturbation of the transport machinery,16 would inhibit autophagosome maturation. autophagy has been induced, but there is no or limited autophagic flux. an autophagosome can fuse with an endosome to generate an amphisome. the large size of the fungal vacuole relative to autophagosomes allows the release of the single-membrane autophagic body within the vacuole lumen. autophagic activity includes not just increased synthesis or lipidation of Atg8/LC3. autophagic substrates need to be monitored dynamically over time. by responding to perturbations in the extracellular environment, cells tune the autophagic flux to meet intracellular metabolic demands. in theory, these nonautophagic processes can be assessed by blocking autophagic sequestration at specific steps of the pathway (e.g., blocking further induction or nucleation of new phagophores) the key issue is to differentiate between the often transient accumulation of autophagosomes due to increased induction, and their accumulation due to inefficient clearance of sequestered cargos. phagosomes, are not measures of autophagic flux per se, but can reflect the induction of autophagic sequestration and/or inhibition of autophagosome clearance. however, we do not know the actual mechanistic relationship between Atg8\u2013PE/LC3-II formation and the rest of the autophagic process. we recommend that researchers refrain from the use of the expression \u201cpercent autophagy\u201d when describing experimental results. this revised set of guidelines does not separate the methods based on this criterion. readers should be aware that this article is not meant to present protocols, but rather guidelines. however, these cautions are not meant to be a deterrent to undertaking any of these experiments or a hindrance to data interpretation. cytoplasmic constituents are sequestered randomly, resulting in autophagosomes in the size range of normal mitochondria. cellular components that form large confluent areas excluding bulk cytoplasm do not seem to be sequestered by macroautophagy. the situation is less clear with regard to glycogen. autophagosomes, also referred to as initial autophagic vacuoles (AVi), typically have a double membrane. this structure is usually visible by EM as 2 parallel membrane layers (bilayers) separated by a relatively narrower or wider electron-translucent cleft. this electron-translucent cleft is less visible or not visible in freeze-fixed samples. late/degradative autophagic vacuoles/autolysosomes (AVd or AL) typically have only one limiting membrane. often they contain electron dense cytoplasmic material and/or organelles at various stages of degradation. the vesicle next to the AVd is an endosomal/lysosomal structure containing 5-nm gold particles that were added to the culture medium to trace the endocytic pathway. one AVi, containing rough ER and a mitochondrion, and one AVd, containing partially degraded rough ER, are shown. the sequential deterioration of cytoplasmic structures being digested can be used for identifying autolysosomes by TEM. degradation usually leads first to increased density of still recognizable organelles, then to vacuoles with heterogenous density, which become more homogenous and amorphous. autophagy engulfs apoptotic cells via phagocytosis also produces lysosomes that contain cytoplasmic structures. in this case it originates from the dying cell; therefore the possibility of an extracellular origin for such content must be considered when monitoring autophagy. LC3 is involved in specialized forms of endocytosis like LC3-associated phagocytosis. LC3 can decorate vesicles dedicated to exocytosis in nonconventional secretion systems. immunohistochemistry can be performed using an antigen retrieval method. then tissues are stained by the ABC technique using a labeled anti-human LC3 antibody. the same prepared slides can be remade into sections for TEM examination. confocal fluorescence microscopy and fluorescence microscopy with deconvolution software can be used to generate multiple/serial sections of the same cell to reduce this concern. newer EM technologies, including focused ion beam dual-beam EM, should make it much easier to apply three-dimensional analyses. o-SXT extracts ultrastructural information from whole, unstained mammalian cells as close to the \u201cnear-native\u201d fully-hydrated (living) state as possible. correlative studies combining cryofluorescence and cryo-SXT workflow (cryo-CLXM) have been applied to capture early autophagosomes. lipofuscin is easily distinguished from AVs and lysosomes by TEM. TEM observations of platinum-carbon replicas obtained by freeze fracture technique can also supply useful ultrastructural information on the autophagic process. autolysosomes are delimited by a single membrane because the inner membrane is also degraded by the lytic enzymes. autophagic bodies can be stabilized, however, by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (PMSF) or genetically by the deletion of the yeast PEP4 gene. TEM maintains its special role in autophagy research. the difficulty lies in the fact that many subcellular components may be mistaken for autophagic structures. the difficulty lies in the fact that many subcellular components may be mistaken for autophagic structures. ex vivo tissue should be fixed immediately and systematically across samples to avoid changes in autophagy that may occur simply due to the elapsed time ex vivo. rapid freezing techniques such as high pressure freezing followed by freeze substitution may be particularly useful. a change in the volume fraction of the autophagic compartment may come from 2 sources; from the real growth of its size in a given cytoplasmic volume, or from the decrease of the cytoplasmic volume itself. correction factors should always be used for measuring the autophagic vacuoles and the cytoplasm. the confusion of heterophagic structures with autophagic ones is a major source of misinterpretation. a prominent example of this is related to apoptosis. heterophagic elements interfering with identification of autophagic ones is most prominent in cell types with particularly intense heterophagic activity. the most common organelles confused with autophagic vacuoles are mitochondria, ER, endosomes, and also (depending on their structure) plastids in plants. EM is an extremely informative and powerful method for monitoring autophagy. it is the only technique that shows autophagy in its complex cellular environment with subcellular resolution. EM is best used in combination with other methods to ensure the complex and holistic approach. atg8/LC3 is a ubiquitin-like protein that can be conjugated to PE (and possibly to phosphatidylserine137) in yeast and several other organisms, the conjugated form is referred to as Atg8\u2013PE. atg8 homologs share from 29% to 94% sequence identity with the yeast protein. at least in certain cell types the LC3 subfamily may be dispensable for bulk autophagic sequestration of cytosolic proteins. LC3 and GABARAP proteins may be involved in recognizing distinct sets of cargoes for selective autophagy. in cells of neuronal origin a high ratio of LC3-I to LC3-II is a common finding. in brain tissue, LC3-I is much more abundant than LC3-II. in enriched fractions of autophagosomes, autolysosomes and ER, both LC3-I and LC3-I are observed in the liver. blot analysis of the membrane and cytosol fraction from a cell lysate can be useful to measure LC3 isoforms. atg5+/+ (wild-type) and atg5-/- MEFs were cultured in DMEM without amino acids and serum for the indicated times. lysosomal protease inhibitors reveals the apparent decrease in LC3-II is due to lysosomal degradation. LC3-II/LC3-I ratio was calculated based on densitometry analysis. cells were cultured in nutrient-rich medium or incubated for 4 h in starvation conditions. starvation results in modest increase (HEK 293 cells) or even a decrease (HeLa cells) the pattern of LC3-I to LC3-II conversion seems to be cell specific, but also related to the kind of stress to which cells are subjected. LC3-I consumption and the evaluation of LC3-II levels would necessarily reveal a slight induction of autophagy. western blotting can be used to monitor changes in LC3 amounts. however, even if the total amount of LC3 does increase, the magnitude of the response is generally less than that documented in yeast. ATG4A is able to cleave the GABARAP subfamily, but has very limited activity toward the LC3 subfamily. a C-terminal fusion will be cleaved immediately by Atg4. this is particularly evident in those cells that show low levels of LC3-II. LC3-II is abundant in brain tissue, and the intensity of the LC3-I band may obscure detection of LC3-II. some cell lines have much less visible LC3-I compared to LC3-II. LC3-II also associates with the membranes of nonautophagic structures. LC3 can be recruited directly to apoptotic cell-containing phagosome membranes,179,180 macropinosomes,179 the parasitophorous vacuole of Toxoplasma gondii,181 and single-membrane entotic vacuoles. LC3 is involved in secretory trafficking as it has been associated with secretory granules in mast cells184 and PC12 hormone-secreting cells. an LC3+ autophagosome-like organelle is observed during herpes simplex virus type 1 infection. influenza A virus directs LC3 to the plasma membrane via a LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif in its M2 protein. a western blot will detect LC3 in the entire cell population, including those that are not transfected. western blotting of LC3 should be performed on frozen biopsy samples homogenized in the presence of general protease inhibitors. PVDF membranes may result in a stronger LC3-II retention than nitrocellulose membranes, possibly due to a higher affinity for hydrophobic proteins. more than one \u201chousekeeping\u201d protein (HKP) can be overloaded on the gel200. actin levels may decrease when autophagy is induced in many organisms. alternative approach is to stain for total cellular proteins. LC3 is expressed in mammalian cells as multiple isoforms (LC3A, LC3B, LC3B2 and LC3C206,207), which exhibit different tissue distributions. a point of caution along these lines is that the increase in LC3A-II versus LC3B-II levels may not display equivalent changes in all organisms under autophagy-inducing conditions. anti-GABARAPL1 antibody can be analyzed by western blot. antibody specificity can be assessed after complete inhibition of GABARAP (or any other Atg8 family protein) expression by RNA interference. in non-mammalian species, discrimination of Atg8\u2013PE from nonlipidated form can be complicated by their nearly identical SDS-PAGE mobilities and the presence of multiple isoforms. in yeast, it is possible to resolve Atg8 (the nonlipidated form) from Atg8\u2013PE by including 6 M urea in the SDS-PAGE separating gel,213 or by using a 15% resolving gel without urea. LC3-I can be fully degraded by the 20S proteasome or processed to a form appearing equal in size to LC3-II on a western blot (LC3-T); LC3-T is devoid of the ubiquitin conjugation domain, thus lacking its adaptor function for autophagy. the stress resulting from centrifugation can induce autophagy. it is not intended to limit the use of any specific methodology, but rather to note that there are no perfect assays. it is important to verify that the positive and negative controls behave as expected in any assays being utilized. lysosomes appear to reduce gene delivery, which increases 8\u201310 fold in cells that are unable to make TVAs due to the absence of ATG5. the precise composition of media components and the density of cells in culture can have profound effects on basal autophagy levels. LC3 immunoblots are often inferred on the basis of LC3-II turnover. lysosomal degradation can be prevented through the use of protease inhibitors. lysosomal degradation can be prevented through the use of protease inhibitors. knocking down or knocking out LAMP2 (lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2) represents a genetic approach to block the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes. this approach, however, is only valid when the knockdown of LAMP2 is directed against the mRNA region specific for the LAMP2B spliced variant. a treatment condition increasing LC3-II on its own that has no difference in LC3-II in the presence of bafilomycin A1 compared to treatment alone may suggest a complete block in autophagy at the terminal stages. a dose-curve and time-course standardization is required for the initial optimization of the conditions to detect LC3-II accumulation. a subpopulation of LC3-II exists in a cytosolic form (LC3-IIs) 237-239 The amount of cytosolic LC3-IIs and the ratio between LC3-I and LC3-IIs appears to correlate with changes in autophagy. the validity of this method has been demonstrated by comparing autophagic proteolytic flux in rat hepatocytes, hepatoma cells and myoblasts deficient mutant of LC3 (G120A) is more sensitive to autophagic degradation. a change in autophagy-dependent LC3 turnover can thus be estimated by monitoring the change in the ratio of luciferase activities between the 2 cell populations expressing either Rluc-LC3WT or Rluc-LC3G120A. a live cell luciferase substrate makes it possible to monitor changes in autophagic activity in real time. the use of a radioactive pulse-chase analysis provides an alternative to lysosomal protease inhibitors. such inhibitors should still be used to verify that degradation is lysosome-dependent. these techniques may not be practical in all cell types or in tissues from whole organisms where the use of protease inhibitors is problematic. an increase in LC3-II levels in combination with the lysosomal removal of an autophagic substrate provides an independent assessment of autophagic flux. however, it is probably prudent to monitor both turnover of LC3-II and an autophagosome substrate in parallel. pepstatin alone is a less effective lysosomal proteolytic block. a possible alternative to pepstatin A is the pepstatin A, BODIPY\u00ae FL conjugate. chloroquine (10\u201340 M) or bafilomycin A1 (1\u2013100 nM) can be added to cells immediately prior to autophagy induction. pre-incubations in (B) were for 1 or 4 h as indicated. 10 mM NH4Cl (or 30 M chloroquine, not shown) were the most effective compounds for demonstrating the accumulation of LC3-II. pepstatin A at 10 g/ml with a 1 h pre-incubation was not effective at blocking degradation. an assessment of autophagic GFP-LC3 flux is a carrier flux that cannot be equated with an autophagic cargo flux. the appearance of free GFP on western blots can be used to monitor lysis of the inner autophagosome membrane and breakdown of the autophagic bodies within the fungal and plant vacuole. a reduction in the intensity of the free GFP band may indicate reduced flux, but it may also be due to efficient turnover. in yeast the diffuse fluorescent haze from the released GFP moiety within the vacuole lumen can be observed by fluorescence microscopy. HeLa cells stably transfected with GFP-LC3 were treated with various concentrations of chloroquine (CQ) for 6 h. total lysates were prepared and subjected to immunoblot analysis. panel (B) and (C) are modified from the data previously published in ref. 257. a decline implies that GFP-LC3 is delivered to properly acidified lysosomes and may reflect proteolytic elimination within them. a potential solution to this problem is to follow flux by adding lysosomal protease or fusion inhibitors to cells expressing GFP-LC3. an enzymatic assay such as the Pho860 assay may be preferred. however, as with any enzyme assay, appropriate caution must be used. the enzymatic assay may be preferred. free GFP can be detected when cells are treated with nonsaturating doses of inhibitors such as chloroquine, E-64d and bafilomycin A1. the saturating concentrations of these lysosomal inhibitors vary in different cell lines. caution should be exercised in interpreting the data using this assay. exposure settings as are used for GFP, thus minimizing potential bias in interpretation. caution is required when evaluating the localization of mCherry fusion proteins during autophagy due to the persistence of the mCherry signal in acidic environments. red fluorescent proteins (even the monomeric forms) can be toxic due to oligomer formation. the pH optimum of EGFP is important to consider when using GFP-LC3 constructs. the original GFP-LC3 marker269 uses the EGFP variant. lysosomal inhibition is likely to induce a secondary autophagic response triggered by the accumulated undigested autophagy cargo. tg8/LC3 processing assay monitors free GFP generated within the vacuole/lysosome. it measures the flux of an autophagic carrier, which may not necessarily be equivalent to autophagic cargo flux. detection of GFP-LC3/Atg8 is also useful for in vivo studies using transgenic organisms such as Caenorhabditis elegans. use of imaging cytometry allows rapid and quantitative measures of the number of LC3 puncta and their relative number in individual or mixed cell types. the watershedCounting3D plug-in for ImageJ may be useful. changes in the detection and localization of GFP-LC3 upon the induction of autophagy. more cells can be easily analyzed because nearly 100% of the population will express tagged LC3. a disadvantage of stable transfectants is that the integration sites cannot always be predicted, and expression levels may not be optimal. a double transfection can be used to visually tag the cells that express the protein being examined. in clones, the uniformity of expression of GFP-LC3 facilitates \u201cthresholding\u201d when scoring puncta-positive cells. in clones, the uniformity of expression of GFP-LC3 facilitates \u201cthresholding\u201d when scoring puncta-positive cells. there is also a need to be aware that a single cell clone may not be representative of the overall pool. preincubation of cells expressing GFP-LC3 with leupeptin can help stabilize the GFP-LC3 signal during fluorescence microscopy. leupeptin is an inhibitor of lysosomal cysteine and serine proteases and will therefore inhibit degradation of membrane-conjugated GFP-LC3 that is present within autolysosomes. it is possible to detect changes in the size of GFP-Atg8/LC3 puncta by fluorescence microscopy. however, it is not possible to correlate size with autophagy activity without additional assay methods. high-content imaging analysis methods enable quantification of GFP-LC3 puncta in thousands of cells per sample. if cells are rounding up due to apoptosis or mitosis, it is easy to remove them from analysis based on nuclear morphology. multispectral imaging flow cytometry allows characterization of single cells within a population by assessing a combination of morphology and immunofluorescence patterns. this method can also be used for endogenous LC3 and, therefore, is useful for nontransfected primary cells. inhibition of autophagy in vitro and in vivo leads to accumulation of these aggregates. the receptor protein SQSTM1 is required for the formation of ubiquitinated protein aggregates in vitro. many cellular stresses can induce the formation of aggregates, including transfection reagents. lipidation-defective LC3 mutant where glycine 120 is mutated to alanine is targeted to these aggregates independently of autophagy. as a result, this mutant can serve as another specificity control. ubiquitinated protein aggregates in cytosol, ubiquitinated protein aggregates in autophagosomes and/or more \u201cconventional\u201d phagosomes. in dictyostelium, inhibition of autophagy leads to huge ubiquitinated protein aggregates containing SQSTM1 and GFP-Atg8. the large size of the aggregates makes them easily distinguishable from autophagosomes. 3-MA does not inhibit BECN1-independent autophagy. 10-NCP 10-(4\u2032-N-diethylamino)butyl)-2-chlorophenoxazine. the latter may result from inhibition of ATP2A/SERCA. 226 9. Betulinic acid A pentacyclic triterpenoid that promotes paralell damage in mitochondrial and lysosomal compartments. the latter may result from inhibition of ATP2A/SERCA. ylacea are accelerated in rat astroglia and astrocytes of GFAP-HMOX1 transgenic mice. ylacea are accelerated in the lysosomal TPCN/two-pore channel. pathogen-derived Virally-encoded autophagy inhibitors include HSV-1 ICP34.5, -herpesvirus 68 M11, ASFV vBCL2, HIV-1 Nef and influenza A virus M2.566,892,896,897,902. pepstatin A An aspartyl protease inhibitor that can be used to partially block lysosomal degradation. RSVAs Synthetic small-molecule analogs of resveratrol that potently activate AMPK and induce autophagy. 1513 35. Saikosaponin-d A natural small-molecule inhibitor of ATP2A/SERCA that induces autophagy and autophagy-dependent cell death. the use of GFP-LC3 in primary nontransgenic cells is more challenging. controls need to be included to verify that the transfection protocol itself does not induce GFP-LC3 puncta or cause LC3 aggregation. transfection should be performed with low levels of constructs. a variation in pixel intensity is not observed in cells where autophagy is not occurring. LC3-II is not necessarily associated with autophagosomes as is often assumed. the protein is also found on phagophores, the precursors to autophagosomes. a chimera may behave differently from the native protein in some respects. some forms of GFP tend to oligomerize, which may interfere with protein function and/or localization. some forms of GFP tend to oligomerize, which may interfere with protein function. tandem mRFP/mCherry-GFP fluorescence microscopy enables simultaneous estimation of both the induction of autophagy and flux through autophagic compartments without requiring the use of any lysosomal inhibitors. the method can be used to monitor autophagy in high-throughput drug screening studies. 233,344 organelle-specific variations of the tandem mRFP/mCherry-GFP reporter system have successfully been used to analyze selective types of autophagy. mRFP signals of tandem fluorescent LC3 (tfLC3, mRFP-GFP-LC3) show different localization patterns. ella biosensor provides information about the environment of the biosensor during autophagy of various cellular components. in yeast, the biosensor can be expressed in mammalian cells to follow either nonselective autophagy (cytoplasmic turnover), or mitophagy. mRFP/mCherry-GFP relies on the quenching of the GFP signal in the acidic autolysosome. however, fixation solutions are often neutral or weak bases. this would cause an underestimation of the amount of signal that corresponds only to RFP. colocalization of mRFP-GFP-LC3 may also be seen in the case of impaired proteolytic degradation within autolysosomes or altered lysosomal pH. the cytotoxicity of DsRed and its variants such as mRFP1 is associated with downregulation of BCL2L1/Bcl-xL. autophagy is becoming increasingly clear, highlighting a tight network between the autophagy machinery, energy sensing pathways and the cell's metabolic circuits. lysosomes may be able to fuse, but be unable to degrade newly delivered cargo. best practice would be to perform an autophagic flux assay in parallel with quantification of tandem fluorescent markers. soluble EGFP-LC3-I can be depleted from the cell by a brief saponin extraction. saponin extraction allows quantification of LC3-II fluorescence by FACS. saponin extraction can also be used to measure flux of endogenous LC3 protein. human osteosarcoma cells were starved of amino acids and serum. saponin extraction can also be combined with intracellular staining for endogenous LC3 protein. LC3 allows combined staining of membrane-associated LC3-II protein and any markers for detection of autophagy in relation to other cellular events/processes. the presence of basal or starvation-induced autophagy is detected in G1, S, and G2/M phases of the cell cycle in MEFs with doxycycline-regulated ATG5 expression. flow cytometry only measures changes in total GFP-LC3 levels. this approach cannot accurately evaluate localization (e.g., to autophagosomes) or lipidation (generation of LC3-II) without further permeabilization of the cell. this type of assay should not be used to draw conclusions that autophagy is increased in cancer or other tissue samples. this type of information may prove useful in the identification of subgroups of patients for targeted therapy. beCN1 was detected during follicular atresia in the ovary of 3 fish species using paraffin sections. a punctate immunostaining for BECN1 is scattered throughout the cytoplasm of the follicular cells when they are in intense phagocytic activity for yolk removal. phosphorylation of SQSTM1 at Ser403 appears to regulate its role in the autophagic clearance of ubiquitinated proteins. decreased SQSTM1 levels are associated with autophagic degradation. a robust loss of SQSTM1 does not correlate with increased autophagic flux as assessed by a luciferase-based measure of flux. a decrease of SQSTM1 can even relate to a blockage of autophagy due to cleavage of the protein. a stable cell line expressing EGFP-tagged SQSTM1 under the control of an inducible promoter can be used to assess the rates of SQSTM1 degradation. a radioactive pulse-chase assay can measure the rates of SQSTM1 degradation. SQSTM1 contains domains that interact with several signaling molecules,426 and SQSTM1 may be part of MTORC1.427. the complexity of using SQSTM1 as an autophagy marker protein is underscored by its capacity to modulate the NFE2L2/NRF2 anti-oxidant response pathway through a KEAP1 binding domain. stressors that impair the UPS induce the aggregation/dimerization of SQSTM1. a number of stressors that impair the UPS induce the aggregation/dimerization of SQSTM1-bound proteins. this can be seen by the detection of a high molecular mass protein complex by western blot. Western blot analysis of cell lysates prepared using NP40- or Triton X-100-containing lysis buffers in autophagic conditions typically shows a reduction in SQSTM1 levels. this does not necessarily indicate that SQSTM1 is degraded, because SQSTM1 aggregates are insoluble in these detergent lysis conditions. if LC3 changes are rapid, clearance of substrates may require a longer time. an alternative method is immunostaining, with and without autophagy inhibitors, for SQSTM1 which will appear as either a diffuse or punctate pattern. a decreased SQSTM1:BECN1 protein level ratio can be used as a readout of autophagy. a decreased SQSTM1:BECN1 protein level ratio may be interpreted as augmented autophagy. a novel protein family of autophagy receptors, named CUET, was identified. small protoaggregates often stain positively for SQSTM1 and may be similar in size to autophagic puncta. soluble SQSTM1 or GFP-u/GFP-degron reporters will mark SQSTM1-positive protein inclusions. this can skew the interpretation of soluble SQSTM1 and/or proteasomal function, accordingly. LK1 and ULK2 that bind ATG13 and RB1CC1/FIP200.455 may play a role that is restricted to senescence and that is independent of the core autophagy machinery. pharmacological inhibition of ULK1 and ULK2 with the compound MRT68921, blocks macroautophagy. regulation of AMPK activity is mediated primarily by Thr172-dephosphorylating protein phosphatases such as PPP1/PP1 (protein phosphatase 1) and PPP2/PP2A (protein phosphatase 2).461 AMP and ADP inhibit dephosphorylation and promote AMPK activity. AMPK acts as a fine-tuned sensor of the overall cellular energy charge that regulates cellular metabolism to maintain energy homeostasis. autophagy-promoting effects of AMPK are most evident in cells cultured in a complete medium with serum and amino acids. AMPK antagonizes the autophagy-inhibitory effect of amino acids by phosphorylating proteins involved in activated (phosphorylated) AMPK. AMPK and MTORC1 regulate autophagy through coordinated phosphorylation of ULK1. phosphorylation at ser555 is indicative of increased autophagy in response to nutrient stress, whereas Ser757 is targeted by MTOR to inhibit autophagy. ULK1 phosphorylates AMBRA1,488 and the MLCK-like protein Sqa,489 as well as ATG13, ATG9 and RB1CC1/FIP200.423,490-493. the activated ULK1 phosphorylates BECN1 on Ser14, enhancing the activity of the complexes containing ATG14 and PIK3C3/VPS34. PtdIns3K 494 BECN1 S90 MAPKAPK2-MAPKAPK3 Stimulates macroautophagy 1525 BECN1 S91, S94 (S93, S96 in human) AMPK Required for glucose starvation-induced macroautophagy 1526 BECN1 Y229, Y233 EGFR Inhibits macroautophagy 523 BECN1 S234, S295 AKT Suppresses macrophagy 522 7 MTORC1 Prevents ULK1 interaction with AMPK 478,512 ULK1 S758 MTORC1 Facilitates ULK1 interaction with AMPK 477,512 ULK1 S637 MTORC1. autophosphorylation Modulates the conformation of the C-terminal tail and prevents its interaction with ATG13 492,1533 TORC1 activity can be monitored by following the phosphorylation of its substrates. rapamycin strongly reduces RPS6KB1 phosphorylation, whereas its effect on EIF4EBP1 is more variable. anti-phospho-ULK1 antibodies should be used to directly examine the phosphorylation state of ULK1. assessing the phosphorylation levels of this protein by immunoprecipitation or western blotting can be used to monitor the activity of some of the upstream nutrient-sensing kinases. phosphorylation of Atg1 at Thr226 is required for its kinase activity and for autophagy induction. the upper band corresponds to autophosphorylation of Atg1. the figure was modified from data previously published in ref. 508, and is reproduced by permission of the American Society for Cell Biology, copyright 2011. a decrease in TORC1 activity is a good measure for autophagy induction. however, TORC1 activity does not necessarily preclude autophagy induction because there are TOR-independent mechanisms that induce autophagy in mammals and yeast. the regulation of autophagy by MTOR can be ULK1-independent. in mycobacterial infection of macrophages, MTOR induces the expression of MIR155 and MIR31 to sustain the activation of the WNT5A and SHH/sonic hedgehog pathways. atg1/ULK1 kinase activity appears to increase when autophagy is induced, irrespective of the pathway leading to induction. however, monitoring changes in activity of Atg1/ULK1 is not a direct assay for autophagy, although such changes may correlate with autophagy activity. atg9 Atg9 is the only integral membrane Atg protein that is essential for autophagosome formation in all eukaryotes. if the protein acts along with or after Atg1, all of the Atg9-GFP will be confined to the PAS. atg12\u2013Atg5 ATG5, ATG12 and ATG16L1 associate with the phagophore and have been detected by fluorescence or immunofluorescence. the endogenous proteins form puncta that can be followed to monitor autophagy upregulation. the endogenous proteins form puncta that can be followed to monitor autophagy upregulation. the total amount of the ATG12\u2013ATG5 conjugate may increase following prolonged starvation as has been observed in hepatocytes and both mouse and human fibroblasts. a human homolog, named ATG14/ATG14L/BARKOR, has been identified. 16L1 ATG16L1 can be detected by immuno-TEM, by immunostaining of Flag epitope-tagged ATG16L1 and/or by the use of GFP-tagged ATG16L1. these proteins bind phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) present at the phagophore and autophagosome559,560 and also PtdIns(3,5)P2. using either endogenous WIPI1 or WIPI2, basal autophagy can be detected in cells that display WIPI puncta at autophagosomal membranes. in cases of increased autophagic activity, such as nutrient starvation or rapamycin administration, the induction of autophagy is reflected by the elevated number of cells that display WIPI puncta. cells were treated for 3 h with nutrient-rich medium (control), nutrient-free medium (EBSS) or with 233 nM wortmannin. an automated imaging and analysis platform was used to determine the number of both GFP-WIPI1 puncta-positive cells and the number of GFP-WIPI1 puncta per individual cell. BECN1 is inhibited by its binding to the anti-apoptotic protein BCL2.566 Autophagy is induced by the release of BECN1 from BCL2 by pro-apoptotic BH3 proteins. phosphorylation of BECN1 by DAPK1 (at Thr119, located in the BH3 domain),567 or phosphorylation of BCL2 by MAPK8/JNK1 (at Thr69, Ser70 and Ser87) a population of BECN1 may localize in proximity to the trans-Golgi network,574 it is also present at the ER and mitochondria. in a mouse model of neurodegeneration, autophagic vacuoles in Purkinje neurons contain partially digested organelles that are immunoreactive for BCL2.571,575. CN1-independent autophagy pathway is induced, such aggregates are not formed regardless of the fact that the cell expresses BECN1. the measurement of PtdInsk3K in vitro lipid kinase activity in BECN1 immunoprecipitates can be a useful technique to monitor the functional activity of this complex during autophagy modulation. ZFYVE1/DFCP1 ZFYVE1 binds PtdIns3P that localizes to the ER and Golgi. the ER population of ZFYVE1 marks the site of omegasome formation. STX17 STX17 is a SNARE protein recruited to completely sealed autophagosomes. Sphingolipids are ubiquitous membrane lipids that can be produced in a de novo manner from the ER or by cleavage of sphingomyelin by phosphodiesterases (sphingomyelinases) the multiple different metabolites of the sphingolipid pathway can have quite varied cellular functions. steroyl (C18:0)-ceramide targets damaged mitochondria for autophagic sequestration in response to ceramide stress, leading to tumor suppression. the binding of ceramide to LC3-II can be detected using anti-ceramide and anti-LC3 antibodies. lysates from untreated or autophagy-induced cells have to be immunoprecipitated with an anti-LC3 polyclonal antibody. the obtained immunoprecipitates are subjected to ganglioside extraction, and the extracts run on an HPTLC aluminum-backed silica gel. the extracts run on an aluminum-backed silica gel and analyzed for the presence of specific gangliosides by using monoclonal antibodies. ER stress and hypoxia increase the transcription of Lc3/LC3, Atg5/ATG5 and Atg12/ATG12 by a mechanism involving the unfolded protein response. a stimulus-dependent increase in LC3B expression is detected in neural stem cells undergoing autophagy induction. Rev-erb represses Ulk1, Bnip3, Atg5, Park2/parkin and Becn1 gene expression in mouse skeletal muscle by directly binding to regulatory regions in their DNA sequences. PPARA and NR1H4 compete for the control of lipophagy in response to fasting and feeding nutritional cues. autophagy is critical for Drosophila midgut cell death. there is no significant change in Atg8a or Atg8b mRNA. pGFP-Atg8a can be used to monitor autophagy. ster midgut pGFP-Atg8a puncta (green) and Hoechst 33342 (blue) midgut from early third instar larvae prior to onset of cell death. midgut from dying midgut at 2 h after puparium formation. spermidine treatment triggers epigenetic deacetylation of histone. TFEB acts as a master gene of the CLEAR network and positively regulates the expression of both lysosome and autophagy genes. TFEB activity is regulated by starvation and is controlled by both MAPK1/ERK2- and MTOR-mediated phosphorylation at specific serine residues. TFEB is phosphorylated by MTORC1 on the lysosomal surface, preventing its nuclear translocation. a lysosome-to-nucleus signaling mechanism transcriptionally regulates autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis via MTOR and TFEB. TFEB localization may also be studied to monitor MTOR activity. some studies implicate microRNAs in controlling the expression of proteins associated with autophagy. many of the ATG genes do not show significant changes in mRNA levels when autophagy is induced. however, changes in mRNA levels are not sufficient evidence of autophagy induction. mammalian cell lines may have mutations that alter autophagy signaling or execution. posttranslational modification of ATG proteins Autophagy is controlled by posttranslational modification of ATG proteins such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination, acetylation and cleavage. autophagic protein degradation assays are a well-established method for measuring autophagic flux. the general strategy is first to label cellular proteins by incorporation of a radioactive amino acid (e.g., [14C]- or [3H]-leucine, [14C]-valine or [35S]-methionine) the azide-containing proteins can be detected with an alkyne-tagged fluorescent dye. the turnover of specific proteins can also be measured in a pulse-chase regimen using the Tet-ON/OFF or GeneSwitch systems. the BHMT (betaine\u2013homocysteine S-methyltransferase) fusion protein is cleaved in hepatocyte amphisomes in the presence of leupeptin to generate 32-kDa and 10-kDa fragments. a modified version of this marker can be expressed in other cell lines where it behaves similar to the wild-type protein. it is important to determine that the marker is distributed homogeneously in the cytoplasm. a molecular genetic modification that eliminates the first 60 amino acids prevents the mutant (Pho860) from entering the ER, leaving the zymogen in the cytosol. in either case, a potential problem is that the amino acid may be further metabolized. branched chain amino acids are good indicators of proteolysis in hepatocytes, but not in muscle cells where they are further oxidized. however, such experiments can be carried out in presence of cycloheximide. most pharmacological protease inhibitors have \u201coff target\u201d effects that complicate the interpretation of the data. the Pho860 assay requires standard positive and negative controls (such as an atg1 strain) prApe1 can enter the vacuole through nonselective autophagy. the propeptide of prApe1 is proteolytically cleaved upon vacuolar delivery. the resulting shift in molecular mass can be monitored by western blot. yeast mitophagy requires both the Slt2 and Hog1 signaling pathways. it is also possible to monitor pexophagy in yeasts by the disappearance of activities of specific peroxisome markers such as catalase, alcohol oxidase or amine oxidase. a protein of interest is cloned into a vector containing one half of a fluorescent reporter. a second protein is cloned into a different vector containing the other half of the reporter. this assay can be used to determine protein interactions without prior knowledge of the location or structural nature of the interaction interface. a similar carbon source change from oleic acid or methanol to ethanol or glucose can be used to assay for pexophagy. in addition, mitophagy can be induced by culturing the cells in a nonfermentable carbon source to post-log phase. the nucleus-vacuole junctions are generated by interaction of the outer nuclear membrane protein Nvj1 with the vacuolar protein Vac8.718 Nvj1 further recruits the ER-membrane protein Tsc13. Upon starvation the NVJs bulge into the vacuole and subsequently a PMN-vesicle pinches off into the vacuole. a chimera of mCherry fused to a nuclear localization signal (NLS-mCherry) can be used. a chimera of mCherry fused to a nuclear localization signal (NLS-mCherry) can also be used. a chimera of mCherry fused to a nuclear localization signal can be used. filamentous fungi form an interconnected mycelium of multinucleate hyphae containing up to 100 nuclei in a single hyphal compartment. a mycelial colony grows by tip extension with actively growing hyphae at the colony margin surrounded by an older, inner hyphal network that recycles nutrients to fuel the hyphal tips. mutants such as vac8 and tlg2 accumulate prApe1 under rich conditions, but not during autophagy. the sequestering vesicles are substantially smaller than typical autophagosomes generated during nonselective autophagy. the vacuole is easily identified, making the identification of autophagic bodies much simpler. the GFP-Atg8 processing assay is easy to perform and is suitable for analysis by microscopy as well as western blotting. however, particular care is needed to obtain quantitative data for GFP-Atg8, Pex14-GFP or Om45-GFP. kinetics, and even the occurrence of mitophagic trafficking, seems to be protein species-dependent, even within the mitochondrial matrix.730 Care should be taken when choosing antibodies to assess the degree of mitochondrial protein removal by autophagy. the quality and clarity of the result may vary depending on the specifics of the antibody. polyQ19-luciferase or untagged full-length luciferase serves as a control. autophagic degradation of endogenous aggregates such as lipofuscin can be monitored by fluorescence microscopy. c. allophagy In C. elegans, both paternal mitochondria and membranous organelles are eliminated by an autophagic process. the degradation process can be monitored in living embryos with GFP::ubiquitin, which appears near the sperm chromatin. p-S65-Ub is formed by the kinase PINK1 specifically upon mitochondrial stress. it is amplified in presence of the E3 Ub ligase PARK2. 746 p-S65-Ub antibodies have been used to demonstrate stress-induced activation of PINK1 in various cells including primary human fibroblasts. PINK1-dependent phosphorylation of ubiquitin (p-S65-Ub) upon mitophagic stress. human dermal fibroblasts from healthy controls or Parkinson disease patients carrying a PINK1 loss-of-function mutation (Q456X) were treated with valinomycin for the indicated times and lysates were analyzed by western blot. phagophore and autophagosome marker GFP-LC3 to monitor initiation of mitophagy. visualization of mitochondria (independent of their mitochondrial membrane potential) makes it possible to determine the association of these 2 cellular components. mitochondria should be labeled by a matrix-targeted fluorescent protein transfection. redistribution of cardiolipin to the outer mitochondrial membrane acts as an elimination signal for mitophagy in mammalian cells. an ANXA5 binding assay for externalized cardiolipin can also be considered a good marker for damaged mitochondria and early mitophagy. TEM can be used to demonstrate the presence of mitochondria within autophagosomes. autophagosomes in bafilomycin A1-treated control cells contain a variety of cytoplasmic structures. mitochondria comprise a prominent component of autophagosomes in bafilomycin A1-treated (PINK1 shRNA) cells. this figure was modified from Figure 2 published in ref. 1951. overlapping signals appear as a merged color and can be used as indicators for successful fusion of autophagosomes that contain mitochondria with lysosomal structures. we recommend some form of correlation analysis to assess the value correlating with the strength of the association. sosomal structures (red), and MitoTracker\u00ae Green FM to visualize mitochondria (green) a positive colocalization is indicated by yellow signals (merge) due to the overlap of LysoTracker\u00ae Red and MitoTracker\u00ae Green staining (white arrows) ic stimuli can be quantified at the single-cell level as the percentage of cytosol occupied by mitochondrial-specific fluorescent pixels using NIH ImageJ.758 Immunoblot analysis of mitochondrial proteins from different mitochondrial subcompartments is valuable for validating the data from flow cytometry or microscopy studies. a reliable estimation of mtDNA can be performed by real-time PCR of the MT-ND2 gene expressed as a ratio of mtDNA:n flow cytometry in combination with autophagy and mitophagy inhibitors has been developed to determine mitophagic flux using MitoTracker probes. 750 Certain cellular models require stress conditions to measure the mitochondrial degradation capacity. one exception has been identified in Drosophila where large numbers of mitochondria are cleared by mitophagy during developmentally triggered autophagy. in type 3 mitophagy, mitochondrial fragments or vesicles from damaged organelles are sequestered through a microautophagy-like process. the process of pexophagy is prominent and well described in yeast cells. however, relatively little work has been done in the area of selective mammalian peroxisome degradation by autophagy. phosphorylation of PEX5 at S141 triggers PEX5 ubiquitination and binding of SQSTM1 to peroxisomes targeted for pexophagy. phosphorylation of PEX5 at S141 triggers PEX5 ubiquitination and binding of PEX5 at S141. mitochondrial PARK2 translocates to damaged mitochondria and ubiquitinates a wide range of outer membrane proteins. this results in preferential degradation of mitochondrial outer membrane proteins by the proteasome. however, staining with MitoTracker dyes depends on mitochondrial membrane potential so that damaged, or sequestered nonfunctional mitochondria may not be stained. oTracker dyes might influence mitochondrial motility in axons. PINK1 and PARK2 also participate in an ATG gene-independent pathway for lysosomal degradation of small mitochondria-derived vesicles. mitochondria can be eliminated by extrusion from the cell. the upper channels show TOMM20 (green channel), BrdU (for visualization of newly synthesized mitochondrial DNA, red channel) and merged fluorescence channels. overlay corresponds to the spatial pattern of software thresholded colocalized structures layered on the merged fluorescence channels. chloroplasts produce long tubes called stromules that project out from the organelle outer membrane. stromules are part of the chlorophagy process, by which the stromule tips presumably containing unwanted or damaged chloroplast material are engulfed by autophagic membranes. however, excessively induced autophagy may be cytotoxic and may lead to cell death. chroomatophagy can be seen in cells during nutrient depletion. phenotype consists of giant-autophagosome formation, nucleus membrane rupture and histone-associated-chromatin/DNA leakage. arginine starvation can be achieved by adding purified arginine deiminase. plastids of some cell types adopt autophagic functions, engulfing and digesting portions of the cytoplasm. plastids are characterized by formation of invaginations in their double-membrane envelopes that eventually generate a cytoplasmic compartment within the plastidial stroma. this process is not as rare as initially thought, but authors have only paid attention to it in those cell types where it is particularly frequent. this process requires the core autophagic machinery and can be monitored by following triglyceride content, or total lipid levels. lysophagy is a selective macroautophagy process that participates in cellular quality control through lysosome turnover. by eliminating ruptured lysosomes, lysophagy prevents subsequent activation of the inflammasome complex and innate immune response. oxiapoptophagy has also been observed with 7-hydroxycholesterol and 24S-hydroxycholesterol, which are potent inducers of cell death. it is suggested that oxiapoptophagy could characterize the effect of cytotoxic oxysterols.837 l. Reticulophagy Starvation in yeast induces a type of selective macrophagy of the ER. ubiquitin ligase acts as an inhibitor of 60S ribosomal subunit ribophagy via, at least, Rpl25 as a target. 847,848 Rkr1/Ltn1 and Ubp3-Bre5 likely contribute to adapt ribophagy activity to both nutrient supply and protein translation. autophagy blocks depletion of key autophagy components ATG5, ATG6 or ATG7. AIN-1 colocalizes with SQST-1 that acts as a receptor for autophagic degradation of ubiquitinated protein aggregates. gluconeogenic enzymes such as fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (Fbp1/FBPase), malate dehydrogenase (Mdh2) and isocitrate ly gluconeogenic enzymes are sequestered in specialized 30- to 50-nm Vid vesicles. they can be purified by fractionation and gradient centrifugation. western blotting analysis using antibodies against organelle markers and Fbp1. xenophagy is an important cellular factor in both innate and adaptive immunity. many in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that genes encoding macroautophagy components are required for host defense against infection by bacteria, parasites and viruses. macroautophagy of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. typhimurium) is dependent on ATG9, an essential macrophagy protein. LC3 recruitment to bacteria does not require ATG9.875. the currently available criteria to differentiate LAP from macroautophagy include: i) LAP involves LC3 recruitment to bacteria in a manner that requires ROS production by an NADPH oxidase. macroautophagy is expected to generate double-membrane structures surrounding cargo. nonmotile Listeria monocytogenes can be targeted to double-membrane autophagosomes upon antibiotic treatment. however, subsequent studies have revealed that macroautophagy can also target pathogens within phagosomes, damaged phagosomes or the cytosol. viral proteins such as NS4A stimulate autophagy and protect the infected cell against apoptosis. viral BCL2 proteins, encoded by large DNA viruses, can inhibit autophagy by interacting with BECN1565 through their BH3 homology domain. autophagy contributes to limiting viral pathogenesis in HIV-1 nonprogressor-infected patients by targeting viral components for degradation. some viruses such as vaccinia virus use double-membrane structures that form independently of the autophagy machinery. hepatitis C virus requires BECN1, ATG4B, ATG5 and ATG12 for initiating replication. yersinia pseudotuberculosis is targeted to autophagosomes where they replicate in bone marrow-derived macrophages. bacteria are targeted both to autophagosomes, and LC3-negative, single-membrane vacuoles. infecting pathogens can selectively modulate antibacterial autophagy without influencing basal autophagy. zymophagy was also reported in activated secretory granules of the crypts of Lieberkuhn in the small intestine. one of the major functions of Paneth cells is to prevent translocation of intestinal bacteria by secreting hydrolytic enzymes and antibacterial peptides to the crypt lumens. LC3-II can be found on phagophores and nonautophagosomal membranes. autophagic markers cannot be used to monitor noncanonical autophagy. autophagic sequestration assays constitute marker-independent methods to measure the sequestration of autophagic cargo into autophagosomal compartments. a downscaling and simplification of the method that avoids the density cushion has been introduced. the endogenous LDH cargo marker can be quantified by an enzymatic assay, or by western blotting. cytosolic enzymes having low sedimentable backgrounds are preferable. cuolar sequestering membrane stained with FM 4\u201364.689,697 Sequestration assays can measure flux through individual steps of the autophagy pathway. intralysosomally degraded sequestration probes such as [14C]-lactate or LDH will mark prelysosomal compartments in the absence of degradation inhibitors. lactate hydrolysis can be used to monitor the overall autophagic pathway. free cytosolic mCherry changes from a diffuse to a punctate pattern in an Atg gene-dependent manner. this mCherry dots colocalize with the lysosomal marker Lamp1-GFP during starvation. electro-injection of radiolabeled probes is technically demanding. prApe1 uses a receptor (Atg19) and a scaffold (Atg11) that make the process specific. vesicles that are substantially smaller than autophagosomes can effectively sequester the Cvt complex. this can be bypassed by using a vac8 background. lysosomal degradation is inhibited.12,14,25,924 The duration of such experiments is usually only a few hours; therefore, long-term side effects can be avoided. fluorescence microscopy has also been used to monitor the half-life of autophagosomes. autophagosome-lysosome colocalization and dequenching assay. labeling of dequenched (DQ-BSA) is so extensive that the fluorophore is self-quenched. this conjugate will accumulate in lysosomes. some experiments require the use of inhibitors (e.g., 3-MA or wortmannin) or overexpression of proteins (e.g., RAB7 dominant negative mutants) that may also affect the endocytic pathway. in this case, the lysosomal compartment can be labeled with DQ-BSA overnight before treating the cells with the drugs. a representative sample of tissue constituents is used in quantitative biochemical, centrifugational and morphological studies of autophagic particle populations. the simplest studies of the autophagic process take advantage of sequestered marker enzymes, changes in location of these enzymes, differences in particle/compartment size and differential sensitivity of particles of different sizes to mechanical and osmotic stress. the thin sections required for such studies pose major sampling problems in both intact cells942 and subcellular fractions. however, through homogenization and resuspension, complex and heterogeneous components of subcellular fractions become randomly distributed throughout the fraction volume. however, any aliquot of that volume can be considered a random sample of the whole volume. lysosomes are able to take up sucrose if it is present at high concentrations. the use of sucrose gradients for the isolation of intact organelles is strongly discouraged. several commercially available kits for subcellular fractionation contain reducing compounds such as dithiothreitol. lysosomes are a very heterogeneous pool of organelles that simply fulfill 5 classical criteria, having a pH 5.6, mature cathepsins, the presence of LAMP proteins, a single membrane, and the absence of endosomal and recycling compartment markers. this distinct populations of lysosomes are likely to participate in different functions in the cell. plasmids or in transgenic strains possess either mCherry- or GFP-LC3/Atg8 under control of either inducible or LC3/Atg8 promoter sequences. tissues such as white adipose tissue, ovary, and testes do not express the Actb promoter-driven GFP-Lc3 transgene strongly enough to allow detection of the fluorescent protein. the use of different serotypes of adeno-associated virus could be used to transduce other cell types at the CNS.953,954 This method allows a reproducible and sensitive mCherry-GFP-LC3 detection, and a strong LC3 flux when animals are treated with autophagy inducers. autophagy can be evaluated by measuring levels of these substrates via traditional immunoblot. however, their presence or absence needs to be cautiously interpreted. a study shows that TGM2 (transglutaminase 2) protein levels decrease in mouse liver in vivo. 12 h of fasting in mice may be sufficient to trigger autophagy in muscle,971,972 but the appropriate time should be determined empirically. the expression of autophagy-related factors, as well as the autophagic response to various stimuli and disease states, can differ between muscles of different fiber type, metabolic, and contractile properties. autophagy has been monitored in perfused hearts,979. it is thought to be an important process in several modes of cardioprotection against ischemic injury. however, it may be due to perceived starvation by the ex vivo organ. otic newborns with neonatal encephalopathy exhibit a higher IHC LC3 expression than placentas from newborn without neonatal encephalopathy. the retina is a very suitable organ for ex vivo as well as in vivo autophagy determination. the retina is readily accessible and can be maintained in organotypic cultures for some time. autophagy activation is a direct consequence of the insult,990 MDC labeling is detectable only in the ischemic tissue. staining with MDC is not, by itself, a sufficient method for monitoring autophagy. lysosomal enzymes can be detected by IHC or classical histochemistry. the question of \u201chigh\u201d versus \u201clow\u201d activities can be determined by comparison to the same tissue under control conditions, or to a different tissue in the same organism, depending on the specific question. however, it is still essential to adapt the same rigors for measuring autophagic flux in vivo to measurements made with in vivo systems. a dramatic increase of intracellular free poly-unsaturated fatty acid levels can be observed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in living pancreatic cancer cells within 4 h of autophagy inhibition by omeprazole. omeprazole is one of the most frequently prescribed drugs worldwide and shows only minor side effects even in higher doses. chloroquine suppresses the immunological response in a manner that is not due to its pH-dependent lysosomotropic accumulation. it interferes with lipopolysaccharide-induced Tnf/Tnf- gene expression by a nonlysosmotropic mechanism. chloroquine treatment should be used for short times and at doses that do not induce severe collateral effects. proximal tubule-specific ATG5-deficient mice1002 display a degeneration phenotype earlier than podocyte-specific ATG5-deficient mice. a similar GFP pattern is observed in transgenic mice carrying CAG promoter-driven non-tagged GFP. autophagy regulators PINK1 and PARK2 show loss-of-function mutations in autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism. alterations in autophagy have also been implicated in other neurological diseases including epilepsies, neurometabolic and neurodevelopmental disorders. autophagy inhibition plays a key role in the pathogenesis of inherited autophagic vacuolar myopathies. autophagy inhibition plays a key role in the pathogenesis of inherited autophagic vacuolar myopathies and cardiomyopathies. autophagy inhibition plays a key role in the pathogenesis of inherited autophagic vacuolar myopathies. autophagy plays an important role in the development in vitro of giant phagocytes, a long-lived neutrophil subpopulation, derived from neutrophils of healthy individuals. there is also evidence for altered autophagy in pancreatic beta cells,1038,1039 and in adipocytes 217,1040,1041 of patients with type 2 diabetes. the photosensitizer hypocrellin B-acetate is able to induce macroautophagy at very low concentrations. 1047 A crucial role for therapy-induced autophagy in cancer cells has recently emerged. this is an important point considering the recent clinical surge in the success of cancer immunotherapy in patients. cells lacking the essential chaperone-mediated autophagy gene LAMP2A fail to expose surface CALR after treatment with both Hyp-PDT and mitoxantrone.1058 These observations have highlighted the important, context-dependent role of therapy-induced autophagy in modulating the immune system. autophagy has been established as the cause of cell death;83,281,354,764,1073-1081. many papers claiming a causative role of autophagy in cell death fail to provide adequate evidence. cell death In several cases, autophagy has been established as the cause of cell death;83,281,354,764,1073-1081. the term \u201cautophagic cell death\u201d is now used in at least 3 different ways: (a) autophagy-associated cell death (the original meaning), (b) autophagy-mediated cell death (which could involve a standard mechanism of cell death such as apoptosis, but triggered by autophagy) claim (a) is stronger than claim (a) and needs to be justified by proof that inhibiting autophagy prevents cell death. autophagy can also play an upstream, initiator role in immunity-associated cell death related to the pathogen-triggered hypersensitive response. autophagy may be involved in allowing this death to occur, but also in the vacuolization process itself. cell death can be established in vivo by morphological analysis,1100. a substantial amount of neuronal cell death occurs during neurogenesis, making it problematic to carry out a correct analysis in vivo or ex vivo. a preferred alternative is to accurately quantify cell death by appropriate cytofluorometric or microscopy assays. autophagic cell death can only be demonstrated as death suppressed by the inhibition of autophagy, through either genetic or chemical means. only the determination of cellular viability (ratio between dead/live cells) can be used to accurately determine cell death progression. association with lysosomes is necessary but not sufficient to consider a protein an authentic CMA substrate. a higher degree of confidence can be attained if the association is preferentially with the subset of lysosomes active for CMA (i.e., those containing HSPA8 in their lumen) selective upregulation and blockage of CMA are not currently available. the most selective way to block CMA is by knockdown of LAMP2A. the other components involved in CMA are multifunctional cellular proteins. internalization of the protein of interest inside lysosomes can be monitored using protease protection assays. addition of an exogenous protease removes the protein bound to the cytosolic side of lysosomes. it is inaccessible to the protein that has reached the lysosomal lumen. several commercially available kits for lysosome isolation separate a mixture of lysosomes. blockage of uptake by pre-incubation of the lysosomes with antibodies against the cytosolic tail of LAMP2A also reinforces the hypothesis that the protein is a CMA substrate. changes in total cellular levels of LAMP2A do not have an impact on this pathway unless they also affect their lysosomal levels. it is advisable that changes in the levels of these 2 CMA components are confirmed to occur in lysosomes. this group of lysosomes is defined as those containing HSPA8 in their lumen. in vitro uptake assays are the most efficient way to determine primary changes in CMA independently of changes in other proteolytic systems in the cells. in vitro assays are the most efficient way to determine primary changes in CMA independently of changes in other proteolytic systems in the cells. binding and uptake can be analyzed separately using lysosomes previously treated or not with protease inhibitors. control of the integrity of the lysosomal membrane and sufficiency of the proteases are also essential to discard the possibility that degradation is occurring outside lysosomes. soluble proteins, oligomers and protein aggregates can undergo e-MI. in vitro uptake of e-MI substrates can be reconstituted using isolated late endosomes. another pathway that needs to be considered relative to CMA is chaperone-assisted selective autophagy (CASA) degradation under conditions when CMA is active,1117. expression levels of neuronal CMA substrates does not change upon loss of LAMP2.1120,1124,1125. methods for monitoring CMA that utilize fluorescent probes are available that eliminate the need for isolation. autophagy machinery involved in CASA is very similar to that in other forms of autophagy. the involvement of BAG3 and ubiquitination of client proteins is highly suggestive of CASA activity. autophagy was first detected by TEM in the 1950s (reviewed in ref. 6) cellular components that form large confluent areas excluding bulk cytoplasm do not seem to be sequestered by macroautophagy. the content of the autophagosome and its bordering double membrane remain morphologically unchanged, and clearly recognizable for a considerable time, which can be measured for at least many minutes. autophagosomes, also referred to as initial autophagic vacuoles (AVi), typically have a double membrane. this structure is usually visible by EM as 2 parallel membrane layers (bilayers) separated by a relatively narrower or wider electron-translucent cleft. this electron-translucent cleft, however, is less visible or not visible in freeze-fixed samples. smaller, often electron dense, lysosomes may predominate in some cells. smaller, often electron dense, lysosomes may predominate in some cells and exhibit hydrolase immunoreactivity within the lumen and on the limiting membrane. the AVd contains a region filled by small internal vesicles (asterisk) indicating that the AVd has fused with a multivesicular endosome. no single protein marker, however, has been effective in discriminating autolysosomes from the compartments mentioned above. autophagy of autolysosomes and damaged lysosomes (lysosophagy) may yield populations of double-membrane limited autophagosomes containing partially digested amorphous substrates in the lumen. lysosomes are seen in swollen dystrophic neurites in some neurodegenerative diseases. it is possible to use immunocytochemistry to follow particular cytosolic proteins such as SOD1/CuZn superoxide dismutase and CA/carbonic anhydrase to determine the stage of autophagy. in some autophagy-inducing conditions it is possible to observe multi-lamellar membrane structures in addition to the conventional double-membrane autophagosomes. LC3 is involved in specialized forms of endocytosis like LC3-associated phagocytosis. LC3 can decorate vesicles dedicated to exocytosis in nonconventional secretion systems. antibodies against an abundant cytosolic protein will result in high labeling all over the cytoplasm. TEM can reveal peroxidase reaction deposits in vacuoles within the region that is LC3-immunopositive by light microscopy. remade into sections for TEM examination, which can reveal peroxidase reaction deposits in vacuoles within the region that is LC3-immunopositive by light microscopy. er EM technologies, including focused ion beam dual-beam EM, should make it much easier to apply three-dimensional analyses. correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) is helpful in confirming that fluorescent structures are autophagosomes. some of the GFP puncta detected by light microscopy may correspond to early autolysosomes prior to GFP quenching. scopy can be used as a three-dimensional approach to monitor autophagic process. two computed sections of an electron tomogram of the autophagic vacuole-rich cytoplasm in a hemophagocyte of a semi-thin section after high-pressure freezing preparation. tomography reveals newly formed or degrading membranes with a parallel stretch (B) TEM observations of platinum-carbon replicas obtained by freeze fracture technique can also provide useful ultrastructural information on the autophagic process. the fracture runs preferentially along the hydrophobic plane of the membranes, allowing characterization of the limiting membranes of the different types of autophagic vacuoles and visualization of their limited protein intramembrane particles. TEM can provide accurate information on flux even when the autophagosomes are abnormally small. despite many new methods TEM maintains its special role in autophagy research. the difficulty lies in the fact that many subcellular components may be mistaken for autophagic structures. some authors assume that almost all cytoplasmic structures that are surrounded by 2 parallel membranes are autophagosomes. however, structures appearing to be limited by a double membrane may include swollen mitochondria. quantification of autophagy by TEM morphometry has been controversial. unreliable procedures still continue to be used to avoid misleading results. a change in volume fraction may come from 2 sources. tomographic reconstructions of TEM images can be problematic. starvation-induced autophagosomes should contain cytoplasm (i.e., cytosol and possibly organelles) but autophagosome-related structures involved in specific types of autophagy should show the selective cytoplasmic target, but may be relatively devoid of bulk cytoplasm. the confusion of heterophagic structures with autophagic ones is a major source of misinterpretation. heterophagic elements interfering with the identification of autophagic ones is most prominent in cell types with particularly intense heterophagic activity. the most common organelles confused with autophagic vacuoles are mitochondria, ER, endosomes, and also (depending on their structure) plastids in plants. ribosomes can help distinguish them from the ribosome-free double-membrane of the phagophore and autophagosome. atg8/LC3 detection and quantification Atg8/LC3 is the most widely monitored autophagy-related protein. atg8/LC3 detection and quantification Atg8/LC3 is a ubiquitin-like protein that can be conjugated to PE (and possibly to phosphatidylserine137). the mammalian homologs of Atg8 constitute a family of proteins subdivided in 2 major subfamilies: MAP1LC3/LC3 and GABARAP. the former consists of LC3A, B, B2 and C, whereas the latter family includes GABARAP, GABARAPL1 and GABARAPL2/GATE-16.138. LC3 and GABARAP proteins may be involved in recognizing distinct sets of cargoes for selective autophagy. in most published studies, LC3 has been the primary Atg8 homolog examined in mammalian cells. LC3 is initially synthesized in an unprocessed form, proLC3, which is converted into a proteolytically processed form lacking amino acids from the C terminus. a high ratio of LC3-I to LC3-II is a common finding in cells of neuronal origin. in brain tissue, LC3-I is much more abundant than LC3-II. in enriched fractions of autophagosomes, autolysosomes and ER. the inclusion of lysosomal protease inhibitors reveals that the apparent decrease in LC3-II is due to lysosomal degradation as easily seen by comparing samples with and without inhibitors at the same time points. monitoring autophagy by following steady state amounts of LC3-II without including inhibitors can result in an incorrect interpretation that autophagy is not taking place. cells were cultured in nutrient-rich medium (DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum) or incubated for 4 h in starvation conditions. starvation results in a modest increase (HEK 293 cells) or even a decrease (HeLa cells) in the amount of LC3-II. the use of inhibitors reveals that this apparent decrease is due to lysosome-dependent degradation. neither assessment of LC3-I consumption nor the evaluation of LC3-II levels would necessarily reveal a slight induction of autophagy (e.g., by rapamycin) the conversion of the former to the latter is cell type-specific and dependent on the treatment used to induce autophagy. atg8/LC3 is initially synthesized with a C-terminal extension that is removed by the Atg4 protease. this processing event can be easily monitored by western blot. ATG4C and ATG4D isoforms have very limited activity toward the LC3 subfamily. researchers should be careful to specify whether they are using GFP-Atg8/LC3 (an N-terminal fusion, which can be used to monitor various steps of autophagy) the same is true for the generation of Atg8\u2013PE in yeast in the absence of VPS30/ATG6. the same is true for the generation of Atg8\u2013PE in yeast in the absence of VPS30/ATG6. however, not all of the autophagy-related proteins are required for Atg8/LC3 processing. LC3 is involved in secretory trafficking as it has been associated with secretory granules in mast cells184 and PC12 hormone-secreting cells. LC3 is also detected on secretory lysosomes in osteoblasts186 and amphisome-like structures involved in mucin secretion by goblet cells. a western blot will detect LC3 in the entire cell population, including those that are not transfected. if transfection efficiency is too low, it may be necessary to use methods, such as fluorescence microscopy, that allow autophagy to be monitored in single cells. a western blot will detect LC3 in the entire cell population, including those that are not transfected. membranes may result in a stronger LC3-II retention than nitrocellulose membranes, possibly due to a higher affinity for hydrophobic proteins. this observation is particularly relevant for cells with a high nucleocytoplasmic ratio, such as lymphocytes. a point of caution along these lines is that the increase in LC3A-II versus LC3B-II levels may not display equivalent changes in all organisms under autophagy-inducing conditions. a point of caution along these lines is that the increase in LC3A-II versus LC3B-II levels may not display equivalent changes in all organisms under autophagy-inducing conditions. the commercialized anti-LC3B antibodies also recognize LC3A, but do not recognize LC3C, which shares less sequence homology. caution has to be taken in experiments using FLAG-tagged proteins. antibody specificity can be assessed after complete inhibition of GABARAP (or any other Atg8 family protein) expression by RNA interference. antibody specificity can be assessed after complete inhibition of GABARAP (or any other Atg8 family protein) expression. in yeast, it is possible to resolve Atg8 (the nonlipidated form) from Atg8\u2013PE by including 6 M urea in the SDS-PAGE separating gel,213 or by using a 15% resolving gel without urea. urea combined with prior treatment of the samples with (or without) phospholipase D can often resolve the ATG8 species in plants. LC3-I can be fully degraded by the 20S proteasome or processed to a form appearing equal in size to LC3-II on a western blot. LC3-T was identified in HeLa cells and is devoid of the ubiquitin conjugation domain, thus lacking its adaptor function for autophagy. plasmid transfection or nucleofection can result in the potent induction of autophagy (based on increases in LC3-II or SQSTM1/p62 degradation) in some cell types, the amount of autophagy induced by transfection of a control empty vector may be so high that it is virtually impossible to examine the effect of enforced gene expression on autophagy. the use of dialyzed serum may have profound effects on initiation or progression of autophagy. for example, in the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei starvation-induced autophagy can be prevented by addition of histidine. in rat hepatocytes, an autophagic-lysosomal flux of LC3-II can take place in the absence of an accompanying flux of cytosolic bulk cargo. the relevant parameter is the difference in the amount of LC3-II in the presence and absence of saturating levels of inhibitors. 228 this approach is only valid when the knockdown of LAMP2 is directed against the mRNA region specific for the spliced variant. targeting the region common to the 3 variants would also inhibit chaperone-mediated autophagy. increased levels of LC3-II in the presence of lysosomal inhibition or interfering with autophagosome-lysosome fusion alone may be indicative of autophagic carrier flux. a dose-curve and time-course standardization is required for the initial optimization of the conditions to detect LC3-II accumulation. the same type of assay monitoring the turnover of Atg8\u2013PE can be used to monitor flux in yeast, by comparing the amount of Atg8 present in a wild-type versus a pep4 strain following autophagy induction. autophagic flux can also be monitored by assessing the half-life of the LC3 protein240 post-photoactivation or by quantitatively measuring the autophagosomal pool size and its transition time. a reporter assay based on the degradation of Rluc-LC3 fusion proteins is well suited for screening compounds affecting autophagic flux. the use of a live cell luciferase substrate makes it possible to monitor changes in autophagic activity in live cells in real time. the main caveat regarding the measurement of LC3-IIs/LC3-I is that this method has only been tested in isolated rat hepatocytes and H4-II-E cells. agents that disrupt autophagy (e.g., bafilomycin A1) will still result in an increase in LC3-II. in this situation, agents that disrupt autophagy will still result in an increase in LC3-II. pepstatin A is membrane impermeable and rapidly accumulates within lysosomes. it requires a prolonged incubation (>8 h) and a relatively high concentration (>50 g/ml) to fully inhibit lysosomal CTSD. chloroquine (10\u201340 M) or bafilomycin A1 (1\u2013100 nM) can be added to cells immediately prior to autophagy induction. the use of both methods may be important in some experiments to exclude off-target effects of a single method. pepstatin A at 10 g/ml with a 1 h pre-incubation was not effective at blocking degradation. a 100 M concentration with 4 h pre-incubation had a partial effect. alkalinizing compounds are more effective in blocking LC3-II degradation. lysosomal pH is a critical factor in the detection of free GFP. free GFP fragments are only detectable in the presence of nonsaturating levels of lysosomotropic compounds (NH4Cl or choroquine); otherwise, the autophagic/degradative machinery appears to be too efficient to allow the accumulation of the proteolytic fragment. the pH in the yeast vacuole is higher than that in mammalian or Dictyostelium lysosomes. in yeast the diffuse fluorescent haze from the released GFP moiety within the vacuole lumen can be observed by fluorescence microscopy. total lysates were prepared and subjected to immunoblot analysis. wild-type and atg5-/- MEFs were first infected with adenovirus GFP-LC3 for 24 h. cells were either cultured in regular culture medium with or without CQ (10 M), or subjected to starvation in EBSS in the absence or presence of CQ for 6 h. the presence of lysosomal protease inhibitors should increase the number of GFP-LC3-positive structures. the absence of an effect on the total number of GFP-LC3 puncta or on the percentage of cells displaying numerous puncta is indicative of a defect(s in autophagic flux. the main limitation of the GFP-LC3 processing assay in mammalian cells is that it seems to depend on cell type and culture conditions. the lower pH of mammalian lysosomes relative to that of the yeast vacuole may contribute to differences in detecting free GFP. lysosomal inhibitors vary in different cell lines, and it would be better to use a saturating concentration of lysosomal inhibitors when performing an autophagic flux assay. caution is required when evaluating the localization of mCherry fusion proteins during autophagy due to the persistence of the mCherry signal in acidic environments. Dendra2 is an improved version of the green-to-red fluorescent protein. it is derived from the octocoral Dendronephthya sp.267. it is capable of irreversible photoconversion from a green to a red fluorescent form. lysosomal inhibition of lysosomal hydrolases (>6 h) is likely to induce a secondary autophagic response triggered by the undigested autophagy cargo. this secondary autophagic response can complicate the analysis of the autophagic flux, making it appear more vigorous than it would in the absence of the lysosomal inhibitors. a fluorescent protein such as GFP (GFP-LC3) has been used to monitor autophagy through indirect immunofluorescence or direct fluorescence microscopy. the detection of GFP-LC3/Atg8 is also useful for in vivo studies using transgenic organisms such as Caenorhabditis elegans. tg8 puncta can also be monitored using flow cytometry. changes in the detection and localization of GFP-LC3 upon the induction of autophagy. a disadvantage of stable transfectants is that the integration sites cannot always be predicted. a double transfection can be used to visually tag the cells that express the protein being examined. a disadvantage of transfecting GFP-LC3 with liposomes is that frequently it leads to an unstable efficiency of transfection, causing a reduction in the number of cells effectively expressing GFP-LC3 and degradation of the plasmid. in clones, the uniformity of expression of GFP-LC3 facilitates \u201cthresholding\u201d when scoring puncta-positive cells. a single cell clone may not be representative of the overall pool. a pool of multiple selected clones may reduce artifacts that can arise from the selection and propagation of individual clones from a single transfected cell. if GFP-LC3 puncta is being quantified, it is better to determine the number of puncta corresponding to GFP-LC3 on a per cell basis. manual scoring may be more accurate than relying on a software program. however, manual scoring may be more accurate than relying on a software program. in many cell types it is possible to establish a threshold value for the number of puncta per cell in conditions of \u201clow\u201d and \u201chigh\u201d autophagy. it is then possible to score the population as the percentage of cells displaying numerous autophagosomes. apoptosis or mitosis can result in apparent changes in the number of GFP-LC3 puncta per cell. the cells should be counted using unbiased procedures (e.g., using a random start point followed by inclusion of all cells at regular intervals), and statistical information should be provided. a caution for flow cytometry is that the techniques necessary to produce single cell suspensions can cause significant injury to the cells. staining for plasma membrane permeabilization (e.g., cell death) before versus after isolation is an important control, and allowing a period of recovery between harvesting the culture and staining is also advisable. the interaction of SQSTM1 with ubiquitinated proteins and LC3 is thought to mediate delivery of these aggregates to the autophagy system. many cellular stresses can induce the formation of aggregates, including transfection reagents,315 or foreign DNA (especially if the DNA is not extracted endotoxin free) ubiquitinated protein aggregate formation and clearance appear to represent a cellular recycling process. formation of ubiquitinated protein aggregates that are GFP-LC3 positive can occur in autophagy-deficient cells. ubiquitinated protein aggregates can occur in autophagy-deficient cells. saponin treatment has been used to reduce background fluorescence under conditions where no aggregation of GFP-LC3 is detected in hepatocytes, HEK 293326 and human osteosarcoma cells. however, because treatment with saponin and other detergents can provoke artifactual GFP-LC3 puncta formation, 328 specificity controls need be included in such experiments. 10-NCP 10-(4\u2032-N-diethylamino)butyl-2-chlorophenoxazine; an AKT inhibitor that induces autophagy in neurons. 17-AAG An inhibitor of the HSP90-CDC37 chaperone complex; induces autophagy in certain systems (e.g., neurons) but impairs starvation-induced autophagy and mitophagy in others by promoting the turnover of ULK1.458. DFMO -difluoromethylornithine, an irreversible inhibitor of ODC1 (ornithine decarboxylase 1) that blocks spermidine synthesis and ATG gene expression. ESC8 A membrane-permeable cysteine protease inhibitor that induces autophagy and apoptosis simultaneously by downregulating the MTOR kinase pathway in breast cancer cells. more than one gene involved in autophagy should be targeted to avoid misinterpreting indirect effects. leupeptin is not membrane permeable, so its effect on cathepsins may depend on endocytic activity. pepstatin A An aspartyl protease inhibitor that can partially block lysosomal degradation. a combination of inhibitors (e.g., leupeptin, pepstatin A and E-64d) is needed for complete blockage of degradation. thapsigargin may block fusion of autophagosomes with endosomes by interfering with recruitment of RAB7. thapsigargin may also block fusion of autophagosomes with endosomes by interfering with recruitment of RAB7. transfection should be performed with low levels of constructs. a reduction in the number of induced GFP-LC3 puncta under conditions of autophagy inhibition is helpful. for some primary cells, delivering GFP-LC3 to precursor cells is a powerful alternative to transfection. yeast Atg8 can associate with the vacuole membrane independent of lipidation, so that a punctate pattern does not necessarily correspond to autophagic compartments. the site(s) of LC3 conjugation to PE is not definitively known, and levels of Atg8\u2013PE/LC3-II can increase even in autophagy mutants that cannot form autophagosomes. some forms of GFP tend to oligomerize, which may interfere with protein function and/or localization. david frum: it would be prudent to complement any assays that rely on GFP fusions (to Atg8/LC3 or any protein) with additional methods that avoid the use of this fluorophore. frum: it is recommended that results obtained by GFP-LC3 microscopy be verified by additional assays. mRFP fluorescence indicates a compartment that has not fused with a lysosome. other fluorophores such as mCherry are also suitable instead of mRFP,319. an image-recognition algorithm has been developed to quantify flux of the reporter to acidified compartments. the lower panels are a higher magnification of the upper panels. Arrowheads point to (or mark the location of) typical examples of colocalized signals of mRFP and mRFP. an alternative dual fluorescence assay involves the Rosella pH biosensor. the use of tandem mRFP/mCherry-GFP-LC3/Atg8 reporters in live imaging experiments can be complicated by the motion of LC3/Atg8 puncta. in this case, mRFP colocalized puncta represent newly formed autophagic structures whereas mRFP/mCherry-only puncta are ambiguous. GFP fluorescence in the autolysosome can be recovered upon neutralization of the pH. most of the GFP-LC3 puncta are positive for LAMP1 suggesting that the autolysosomes had recovered GFP fluorescence. the cytotoxicity of DsRed and its variants such as mRFP1 is associated with downregulation of BCL2L1/Bcl-xL. 353 In contrast to mRFP-GFP-LC3, overexpression of mTagRFP-mWasabi-LC3 does not appear to be toxic to HeLa cells. the use of tandem fluorescent constructs provides a convenient way to monitor autophagic flux in many cell types. a number of methods have been developed that allow the determination of autophagic flux using flow cytometry,225,311,327,358-361. soluble EGFP-LC3-I can be depleted from the cell by a brief saponin extraction so that the total fluorescence of EGFP-LC3 then represents that of EGFP-LC3-I alone. this treatment significantly reduces the background fluorescence due to nonautophagosome-associated reporter protein. saponin extraction method can also be combined with intracellular staining for endogenous LC3 protein. saponin extraction method can also be combined with intracellular staining for endogenous LC3 protein. cells were gated based on their DNA content and the relative intensity of GFP-LC3-II and LC3-II expression. this approach might also be used for the detection of autophagic flux in different stages of the cell cycle or subG1 apoptotic cell population. autophagic cells with puncta have higher BDI values. media control, rapamycin-treated wild-type and atg5-/- MEFs were gated based on BDI. endogenous LC3, ATG4B, and ATG9A have been detected by immnohistochemical analyses using both paraffin sections and cryosections. 293 LC3 puncta are also observed in mice in the peripheral nerves, specifically in Schwann cells after neurodegeneration. LC3 is a ubiquitin-like protein that can be conjugated to PE (and possibly to phosphatidylserine137) in yeast and several other organisms, the conjugated form is called Atg8\u2013PE. atg8/LC3-I (approximately 16\u201318 kDa) and Atg8\u2013PE/LC3-II (approximately 14\u201316 kDa) should be indicated on western blots whenever both are detectable. the differences between the LC3 proteins with regard to function and tissue-specific expression are not known. however, some evidence suggests that at least in certain cell types the LC3 subfamily may be dispensable for bulk autophag atg8\u2013PE/LC3-II is the only protein marker that is reliably associated with completed autophagosomes. in yeast, atg8 amounts increase at least 10-fold when autophagy is induced. in cells of neuronal origin a high ratio of LC3-I to LC3-I is a common finding. in brain tissue, LC3-I is much more abundant than LC3-II. the latter form is most easily discernable in enriched fractions of autophagosomes, autolysosomes and ER. but only LC3-I may be discernible in brain homogenate. sosomal protease inhibitors reveals that the apparent decrease in LC3-II is due to lysosomal degradation as easily seen by comparing samples with and without inhibitors at the same time points. monitoring autophagy by following steady state amounts of LC3-II without including inhibitors in the analysis can result in an incorrect interpretation that autophagy is not taking place. endogenous LC3 was detected by immunoblotting. positions of LC3-I and LC3-II are indicated. starvation results in modest increase (HEK 293 cells) or even a decrease (HeLa cells) LC3-II can be obtained by interrupting the autophagosome-lysosome fusion step. some of these treatments may increase autophagosome numbers by disrupting the lysosome-dependent activation of MTOR. atg8/LC3 is initially synthesized with a C-terminal extension that is removed by the Atg4 protease. this processing event can be easily monitored by western blot. there are 4 Atg4 homologs in mammals. there are several caveats to using Atg8/LC3-II or GABARAP-II to visualize fluctuations in autophagy. first, changes in LC3-II amounts are tissue- and cell context-dependent. in some cases, autophagosome accumulation detected by TEM does not correlate well with the amount of LC3-II. lipidation.177 Vagaries in the detection and amounts of LC3-I versus LC3-II present technical problems. some cell lines have much less visible LC3-I compared to LC3-II. some members of the PCDHGC/-protocadherin family undergo clustering. autophagy induced in response to bacterial infection is not directed solely against the bacteria. coronaviruses induce autophagosomes during infection through the expression of nsp6. however, coronaviruses also induce the formation of double-membrane vesicles that are coated with LC3-I. western blotting of LC3 should be performed on frozen biopsy samples homogenized in the presence of general protease inhibitors. a western blot will detect LC3 in the entire cell population, including those that are not transfected. a western blot will detect LC3 in the entire cell population. analysis of a membrane fraction is particularly useful for cells with a high nucleocytoplasmic ratio, such as lymphocytes. a membrane fraction is particularly useful for brain where levels of soluble LC3-I greatly exceed the level of LC3-II. this assay is one of the most widely used in the field. 153,203 In aging skeletal muscle the increase in LC3-I is at least as important as that for LC3-II. 204,205 Quantification of both isoforms is therefore informative, but requires adequate conditions of electrophoretic separation. this is particularly important for samples where the amount of LC3-I is high relative to LC3-II. LC3C possesses in its primary amino acid sequence the DYKD motif. anti-FLAG antibody can detect and immunoprecipitate overexpressed LC3C. caution has to be taken in experiments using FLAG-tagged proteins. antibody specificity can be assessed after complete inhibition of GABARAP (or any other Atg8 family protein) expression by RNA interference. we advise caution in interpreting results based on stated affinities of antibodies unless these have been clearly determined. urea combined with prior treatment of samples with phospholipase D can often resolve the ATG8 species in plants. 214,215 It is also possible to label cells with radioactive ethanolamine, followed by autoradiography to identify Atg8\u2013PE. a C-terminal peptide can be analyzed by mass spectrometry to identify the lipid modification at the terminal glycine residue. LC3-T was identified in HeLa cells and is devoid of the ubiquitin conjugation domain, thus lacking its adaptor function for autophagy. a general issue when working with cell lines is that we recommend that validation be performed to verify the cell line(s) being used, and to verify the presence of genetic alterations as appropriate. the amount of autophagy induced by transfection of a control empty vector may be so high that it is virtually impossible to examine the effect of enforced gene expression on autophagy. this effect is generally not observed with siRNA transfection; however, it is an issue for plasmid expression constructs including those for shRNA and viral delivery systems. trypanosoma brucei starvation-induced autophagy can be prevented by addition of histidine to the incubation buffer. it is important to specify duration of autophagy stimulation, as long-term autophagy can modify signal transduction pathways of importance in cell survival. the difference in the amount of LC3-II in the presence and absence of saturating levels of inhibitors can be used to examine the transit of LC3-II through the autophagic pathway. if flux is occurring, the amount of LC3-II will be higher in the presence of the inhibitor. treatment plus bafilomycin A1 must be compared with results obtained with treatment alone as well as with bafilomycin A1 alone. a treatment condition increasing LC3-II on its own that has no difference in LC3-II in the presence of bafilomycin A1 may suggest a complete block in autophagy at the terminal stages. s is required for the initial optimization of the conditions to detect LC3-II accumulation. positive control experiments using treatment with known autophagy inducers, along with bafilomycin A1 versus vehicle, are important to demonstrate the utility of this approach in each experimental context. autophagic flux can be monitored by assessing the half-life of the LC3 protein240 post-photoactivation or by quantitatively measuring the autophagosomal pool size and its transition time. a reporter assay based on the degradation of LC3-II is well suited for screening compounds affecting autophagic flux. the main caveat regarding the measurement of LC3-IIs/LC3-I is that this method has only been tested in isolated rat hepatocytes and H4-II-E cells. a soluble form of LC3-II (i.e., LC3-Is) is not observed in many standard cell types including HEK 293 and PC12. autophagy modulators can be tested at early (e.g., 4 h) and late (e.g., 24 h) time-points. many of the chemicals used to inhibit autophagy, such as bafilomycin A1, NH4Cl, directly inhibit the endocytosis/uncoating of viruses. pepstatin A is membrane impermeable (ethanol or preferably DMSO must be employed as a vehicle) and requires a prolonged incubation (>8 h) and a relatively high concentration (>50 g/ml) to fully inhibit lysosomal CTSD. pepstatin alone is a less effective lysosomal proteolytic block. e inhibitors upregulate CTSD and have potential inhibitory activity toward calpains and other cysteine proteases. bafilomycin A1 can have potential significant cytotoxicity. the use of both methods may be important in some experiments to exclude off-target effects. the band running just below LC3-I at approximately 17.5 kDa may be a processing intermediate of LC3-I. it is detectable in freshly prepared homogenates, but less visible after the sample is subjected to a freeze-thaw cycle. the appearance of free GFP on western blots can be used to monitor lysis of the inner autophagosome membrane and breakdown of the cargo in metazoans. free GFP fragments are only detectable in the presence of nonsaturating levels of lysosomotropic compounds (NH4Cl or choroquine) atg5-/- MEFs engineered to express Atg5 under the control of the Tet-off promoter were grown in the presence of doxycyline (Dox; 10 ng/ml) for one week to suppress autophagy. cells were then cultured in the absence of drug for the indicated times, with or without a final 2 h starvation. the dynamic movement to lysosomes of GFP-LC3 can be monitored by time-lapse fluorescence microscopy. the dynamic movement to lysosomes of GFP-LC3 can be monitored by time-lapse fluorescence microscopy. a decline implies that GFP-LC3 is delivered to properly acidified lysosomes. the combination of protease inhibitors (to prevent the degradation of GFP) or compounds that modify lysosomal pH such as NH4Cl or chloroquine may be most effective in preventing lysosome-dependent decreases in GFP-LC3 puncta. researchers may also consider the use of protease inhibitors. the main limitation of the GFP-LC3 processing assay in mammalian cells is that it seems to depend on cell type and culture conditions. the lower pH of mammalian lysosomes relative to that of the yeast vacuole may contribute to differences in detecting free GFP. a caution about the use of the EGFP fluorescent protein for microscopy is that this fluorophore has a relatively neutral pH optimum for fluorescence. it is possible to circumvent this latter problem by imaging paraformaldehyde-fixed cultures that are maintained in a neutral pH buffer. a putative advantage of mCherry over mRFP is its enhanced photostability and intensity. modified version of fluorophore has certain properties including a monomeric state, low phototoxic activation and efficient chromophore maturation. another alternative to mRFP is to use the Venus variant of YFP, which is brighter than mRFP. lysosomal inhibition is likely to induce a secondary autophagic response triggered by the accumulated undigested autophagy cargo. this secondary autophagic response can complicate the analysis of the autophagic flux, making it appear more vigorous than it would in the absence of the lysosomal inhibitors. it is also possible to use anti-LC3/Atg8 antibodies for immunocytochemistry or immunohistochemistry (IHC),197,289-294 procedures that have the advantages of detecting the endogenous protein. high levels of overexpressed GFP-LC3 can result in its nuclear localization. this figure was modified from Figure 6 published in ref. 270, Badr et al. Lanatoside C sensitizes glioblastoma cells to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand. monitoring the endogenous Atg8/LC3 protein depends on the ability to detect it in the system of interest. a double transfection can be used to visually tag the cells that express the protein being examined. a disadvantage of transfecting GFP-LC3 with liposomes is that frequently it leads to an unstable efficiency of transfection. stable cell lines are sensitive to autophagy inducers as measured by the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio. using a pool of multiple selected clones may reduce artifacts that can arise from the selection and propagation of individual clones from a single transfected cell. another possibility is using fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) sorting to select a mixed stable population with uniform GFP-LC3 expression levels. if GFP-LC3 is being quantified, it is better to determine the number of puncta corresponding to GFP-LC3 on a per cell basis (or per cell area basis) the number of puncta visible to the eye will also be influenced by both the level of expression of GFP-LC3 in a given cell. however, manual scoring may be more accurate than relying on a software program. in many cell types it may be possible to establish a threshold value for the number of puncta per cell in conditions of \u201clow\u201d and \u201chigh\u201d autophagy. it is then possible to score the population as the percentage of cells displaying numerous autophagosomes. images can be acquired as z-stacks or processed to generate maximum projection or extended depth-of-field images. the cells should be counted using unbiased procedures (e.g., using a random start point followed by inclusion of all cells at regular intervals) chimera can associate with aggregates, especially when expressed at high levels in the presence of aggregate-prone proteins. this does not occur if the GFP-LC3 is expressed at low levels (d.C. Rubinsztein, unpublished observations) SQSTM1-positive aggregates can be found in cells exposed to rapamycin for extended periods where rates of autophagy are elevated. one solution to this artifact is to examine GFP-LC3 puncta in cells stably expressing GFP-LC3. another approach is to use cells transfected with GFP as the background (negative) control. ubiquitinated protein aggregate formation and clearance appear to represent a cellular recycling process. formation of ubiquitinated protein aggregates that are GFP-LC3 positive can occur in autophagosome-deficient cells. in cytosol, inhibition leads to huge ubiquitinated protein aggregates. treatment with saponin and other detergents can provoke artifactual GFP-LC3 puncta formation. however, it is preferable to include additional assays that measure autophagy rather than relying solely on monitoring GFP-LC3. 328 specificity controls need to be included in such experiments. AR7 AR7 was developed as a highly potent and selective enhancer of CMA through antagonizing RARA/RAR. AR7 is the first small molecule developed to selectively stimulate CMA without affecting macroautophagy. ESC8 A cationic estradiol derivative that induces autophagy and apoptosis simultaneously. Everolimus An inhibitor of MTORC1 that induces both autophagy and apoptosis in B-cell lymphoma primary cultures. leupeptin is not membrane permeable, so its effect on cathepsins may depend on endocytic activity. MLN4924 A small molecule inhibitor of NAE (NEDD8 activating enzyme);1504 induces autophagy by blockage of MTOR signals via DEPTOR. PMI p62 (SQSTM1)-mediated mitophagy inducer is a pharmacological activator of autophagic selection of mitochondria that operates without collapsing the mitochondrial membrane potential. thapsigargin may also block fusion of autophagosomes with endosomes by interfering with recruitment of RAB7. trans-3,5,4-trimethoxystilbene upregulates the expression of TRPC4. it provides more complete inhibition than rapamycin (it inhibits all forms of MTOR) delivering GFP-LC3 to precursor cells by infection with recombinant lentivirus, retrovirus or adenovirus is a powerful alternative to transfection of the already differentiated cell type. one option is to measure pixel intensity and divide this by the mean intensity of pixels within the area of analysis. lz granderson: a chimera may behave differently from the native protein. he says some forms of GFP tend to oligomerize, which may interfere with protein function and/or localization. he says some forms of GFP tend to oligomerize, which may interfere with protein function and/or localization. granderson: a chimera may behave differently from the native protein in some respects. mRFP/mCherry-GFP fluorescence microscopy a fluorescence assay relies on a tandem monomeric RFP-GFP-tagged LC3 (tfLC3; Fig. 11). a mRFP signal without GFP corresponds to an amphisome or autolysosome. the tandem mRFP/mCherry-GFP reporter method enables simultaneous estimation of both the induction of autophagy and flux through autophagic compartments without the use of any lysosomal inhibitors. the technique can be used to monitor autophagy in high-throughput drug screening studies. an alternative dual fluorescence assay involves the Rosella pH biosensor. this assay monitors the uptake of material to the lysosome/vacuole. the biosensor can be expressed in mammalian cells to follow either nonselective autophagy (cytoplasmic turnover), or mitophagy. confocal microscopy may not allow visualization of colocalized mRFP/mCherry-GFP puncta. mRFP colocalized puncta represent newly formed autophagic structures. mRFP/mCherry-only puncta are ambiguous. escence in the autolysosome can be recovered upon neutralization of the pH. most of the GFP-LC3 puncta are positive for LAMP1. colocalization between GFP-LC3 direct fluorescence (green) and indirect immunostaining for GFP (red) the Rosella assay has not been tested in a wide range of mammalian cell types. however, the sensitivity and specificity of the assay must be verified independently until this method has been tested more extensively. it may be desirable to capture the dynamic behavior of autophagy in real time. f. autophagic flux determination using flow and multispectral imaging cytometry. commercial kits are now available for monitoring autophagy by flow cytometry. this treatment significantly reduces background fluorescence due to nonautophagosome-associated reporter protein. a tandem mRFP/mCherry-EGFP-LC3 (or similar) construct can also be used for autophagic flux measurements in flow cytometry experiments. saponin extraction method can also be combined with intracellular staining for endogenous LC3 protein. subtle changes in autophagic flux can be measured without reporter transfections. users should carefully titrate saponin concentrations and times of treatment. flow cytometry only measures changes in total GFP-LC3 levels, which can be subject to modification by changes in transcription or translation, or by pH. a major disadvantage is that flow cytometry only measures changes in total GFP-LC3 levels, which can be subject to modification by changes in transcription or translation, or by pH. immunohistochemistry Immunodetection of ATG proteins (particularly LC3 and BECN1) has been reported as a prognostic factor in various human carcinomas, including lymphoma,197,366 breast carcinoma,367 endometrial adenocarcinoma,368,369 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. however, the reported changes often reflect overall diffuse staining intensity rather than appropriately compartmentalized puncta. LC3 puncta is detected along dendrites of intact neurons. granular staining for LC3 appears mainly in the perikarya of neurons in CTSD- or CTSB- and CTSL-deficient mouse brains. LC3 puncta are also observed in mice in the peripheral nerves. LC3 is common in autolysosomes and may be abundant in lipofuscin and other lysosomal residual bodies. immunodetection of LC3 in cytoplasmic granules is not sufficient to monitor autophagy in vivo. anti-phospho-SQSTM1 antibodies can be used to detect the modified form of the protein during autophagy. the level of SQSTM1 during starvation was reduced to atg5+/+. phagic flux.413 Activation of a signaling pathway, e.g., RAF1/Raf-MAP2K/MEK-MAPK/ERK, can also upregulate SQSTM1 transcription. 415,416 Physical exercise, especially when performed during starvation, increases the SQSTM1 mRNA level in skeletal muscle. EGFP-tagged SQSTM1 under the control of an inducible promoter can be used to assess the rates of SQSTM1 degradation. tetracycline can reduce autophagy levels; therefore, the appropriate control of only tetracycline addition has to be included if using an inducible promoter. a reciprocal crosstalk between the UPS and autophagy is established. the accumulation of SQSTM1 due to autophagy inhibition can impair UPS function by competitively binding ubiquitinated proteins, preventing their delivery to, and degradation by the proteasome. monomers are likely a better measurement of changes in SQSTM1 dynamics linked to autophagy or the UPS. this is one reason why SQSTM1 degradation should be analyzed in the presence of a pan-caspase inhibitor such as Q-VD-OPh before concluding that autophagy is activated based on a decrease of this protein. soluble fraction accounts only for the diffuse or free form of SQSTM1. accumulation of SQSTM1 in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction may not be observed. additional assessment of both triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions will provide further information regarding extent of SQSTM1 oligomerization. 1 levels can be tested at the same time points, but also at later time points. an alternative method is immunostaining for SQSTM1 which will appear as either a diffuse or punctate pattern. a final point is that empirical evidence suggests that the species specificity of antibodies for detecting SQSTM1 must be taken into account. a novel protein family of autophagy receptors, named CUET (from Cue5/Tollip), was identified. the CUET proteins possess a ubiquitin-binding CUE-domain and an Atg8-family interacting motif (AIM)/LIR sequence that interacts with Atg8/LC3. TOR/MTOR, AMPK and Atg1/ULK1 atg1/ULK1 are central components in autophagy that likely act at more than one stage of the process. there are multiple ULK isoforms in mammalian cells including ULK1, ULK2, ULK3, ULK4 and STK36. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a multimeric serine/threonine protein kinase comprised of PRKAA1/AMPK1 or PRKAA2/AMPK2 ( catalytic), the PRKAB1/AMPK1 or PRKAB2/AMPK2 (, scaffold), and the PRKAG1/AMPK1, PRKAG2/AMPK2 or PRKAG3/AMPK3 (, regulatory) subunits. AMPK suppresses autophagy at the level of cargo sequestration, as indicated by the rapid sequestration-inhibitory effects of a variety of AMPK activators. in liver cells, AMPK suppresses autophagy at the level of cargo sequestration, whereas it stimulates autophagy in many other cell types. toRC1 is an autophagy-suppressive regulator that integrates growth factor, nutrient and energy signals. AMPK and MTORC1 regulate autophagy through coordinated phosphorylation of ULK1. AMPK promotes autophagy by directly activating ULK1 through phosphorylation. phosphorylation at ser555, an AMPK site, is indicative of increased autophagy in response to nutrient stress. even the autophagy-suppressive effects of AMPK could be mediated through ULK1 phosphorylation. AMPK is involved in processes that synergize to activate autophagy, by directly activating ULK1 and indirectly impairing MTOR-dependent inhibition of ULK1. phosphatases (e.g., sodium fluoride, and beta-glycerophosphate) should be used in cell lysis buffer before analyzing the phosphorylation of AMPK and ULK1 at serine and threonine sites. AMPK, AMPK, GSK3B, MTORC1, PKA and Atg1/ULK1. GSK3A/B Modulates protein aggregation 1529 RPS6KB T389 MTORC1 (apparently indirect, through reduction of dephosphorylation) Necessary for protein activity 1530 RPS6KB S371 GSK3B Necessary for T389 phosphorylation and the activity of RPS6KB 1531 RPTOR S792 AMPK Suppresses MTORC1 475 SQSTM1 S403 ULK EIF4EBP1 at Thr37 and Thr46 are directly phosphorylated by MTORC1.500 The phosphorylation status of RPS6KB and EIF4EBP1 can be detected as a molecular mass shift by western blot. the latter is not a direct substrate of MTORC1. anti-phospho-AMBRA1 antibody could be used to indirectly measure MTORC1 activity. phosphorylation of Atg13 is associated with activation/assembly of the core complex that reflects the reduction of TORC1 and PKA activities. nutritional starvation suppresses TORC1-mediated Atg1 phosphorylation,423,509 while stimulating Atg1-mediated Atg13 phosphorylation. in mammalian cells, the phosphorylation status of ULK1 at the activating sites can be determined by western blot using phospho-specific antibodies. in human macrophages infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, MORN2 is recruited at the phagosome membrane containing M. tuberculosis to induce the recruitment of LC3. MORN2 drives trafficking of M. tuberculosis to a single-membrane compartment. induction of autophagy requires inhibition of MTORC1 and not of MTORC2.525,526. inhibition of MTORC1 is not sufficient to maintain autophagic flux. however, oxidative stress inhibits MTOR, thus allowing autophagy induction. g1/ULK1 is phosphorylated by multiple kinases and the amount of phosphorylation at different sites can increase or decrease during autophagy induction. however, the overall phosphorylation states of ULK1 and ATG13 are decreased under conditions that lead to induction of autophagy. however, monitoring changes in phosphorylation by following molecular mass shifts upon SDS-PAGE may not be informative. atg9 Atg9 is the only integral membrane Atg protein that is essential for autophagosome formation in all eukaryotes. yeast Atg9 may cycle between the phagophore assembly site and peripheral reservoirs. atg1-Atg13, Atg2-Atg18 and the PtdIns3K complex I.538 Mutants such as atg1 accumulate Atg9 primarily at the PAS. if the second mutated gene encodes a protein that is needed for Atg9 anterograde transport, all of the Atg9-GFP will be confined to the PAS. downstream inhibition of autophagy at the level of autophagosome elongation results in an accumulation of the phagophore-associated ATG5, ATG12 and ATG16L1 immunofluorescent puncta. essentially all of the ATG5 and ATG12 proteins exist in the conjugated form. a human homolog, named ATG14/ATG14L/BARKOR, has been identified. 546-549 ATG14 localizes primarily to phagophores. the protein is able to direct GFP and BECN1 to autophagosomes. these proteins bind phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) that is present at the phagophore and autophagosome559,560 and also PtdIns(3,5)P2. Upon the initiation of the autophagic pathway, WIPI1 and WIPI2 bind PtdIns3P and accumulate at limiting membranes, such as those of the ER. WIPI1 puncta can be assessed as an alternative to LC3-II. 560,562 cells without GFP-WIPI1 puncta are highlighted in red (cell detection) and purple (nuclei detection), while GFP-WIPI1 puncta-positive cells are highlighted in yellow (GFP-WIPI1 puncta detection) GFP-WIPI1 and GFP-WIPI2 have been detected on the completed (mature) autophagosome by freeze-fracture analysis. but endogenous WIPI2 has not been detected on mRFP-LC3- or LAMP2-positive autophagosomes. phosphorylation of BECN1 by DAPK1 (at Thr119, located in the BH3 domain),567 or phosphorylation of BCL2 by MAPK8/JNK1 (at Thr69, located in the BH3 domain),567. 570,571 It is important to be aware that certain forms of macroautophagy are induced in a BECN1-independent manner and are not blocked by PtdIns3K inhibitors. beCN1-GFP puncta detected by immunofluorescence microscopy or TEM may serve as an additional marker for autophagy induction. caspase cleavage of BECN1 can be detected in normal culture conditions. cleaved BECN1 is translocated into the nucleus,578. the elimination of DRAM1 by siRNA blocks autophagy,581,582 as effectively as elimination of BECN1, indicating it is an essential component for this process. a commercial DRAM1 antibody may allow the detection of this protein in rat skeletal muscle (D.W. Russ, personal communication) TECPR1 binds ATG5 through an AFIM (ATG5 [five] interacting motif. TECPR1 thus marks lysosomes and autolysosomes. TECPR1 is the only integral membrane Atg protein essential for autophagosome formation in all eukaryotes. Yeast Atg9 may cycle between the phagophore assembly site (PAS) and peripheral reservoirs. most Atg proteins are detected primarily in a single punctum or diffusely within the cytosol. the endogenous proteins form puncta that can be followed to monitor autophagy upregulation. Upon induction of autophagy, for example during starvation there is a marked increase in the proportion of cells with punctate ATG5, ATG12 and ATG16L1. a human homolog, named ATG14/ATG14L/BARKOR, has been identified. 546-549 ATG14 localizes primarily to phagophores. a good antibody that can be used to detect endogenous ATG14 is now available commercially. atg18/WIPI family Yeast Atg18553,554 and Atg21335 (or the mammalian WIPI homologs555) are required for both macroautophagy (i.e., nonselective sequestration of cytoplasm) and autophagy-related processes (e.g., the Cvt pathway,556,557 specific organelle degradation,119 and autophagic elimination of invasive microbes122,123,125,126,55 the reduced number of WIPI puncta-positive cells reflects the inhibition of autophagy. in circumstances of increased autophagic activity, such as nutrient starvation, the reduced number of WIPI puncta-positive cells reflects the inhibition of autophagy. GFP-WIPI1 puncta-positive cells are highlighted in red (cell detection) and purple (nuclei detection), while GFP-WIPI1 puncta-positive cells are highlighted in yellow (GFP-WIPI1 puncta detection), green (cell detection) and blue (nuclei detection). s30/Atg6) and PIK3C3/VPS34 are essential partners in the autophagy interactome that signals the onset of autophagy. beCN1 is inhibited by its binding to the anti-apoptotic protein BCL2.566 Autophagy is induced by the release of BECN1 from BCL2 by pro-apoptotic BH3 proteins. ic vacuoles in Purkinje neurons contain partially digested organelles that are immunoreactive for BCL2.571,575. the presence of BECN1- and PIK3C3/VPS34-positive macroaggregates can be detected in multiple complexes by immunofluorescence. caspase cleavage of BECN1 can be detected in normal culture conditions. lipid kinase activity in BECN1 immunoprecipitates can be a useful technique to monitor the functional activity of this complex during autophagy modulation. 580,581 DRAM1 is a small hydrophobic protein with 6 transmembrane domains. it is detected as a subpopulation in the Golgi and cis-Golgi, colocalizing with EEA1 and LAMP2.581. the ER population of ZFYVE1 marks the site of omegasome formation. STX17 STX17 is a SNARE protein that is recruited to completely sealed autophagosomes, but not to phagophores. j. TECPR1 TECPR1 binds ATG5 through an AFIM. sphingolipids are ubiquitous membrane lipids that can be produced in a de novo manner from the ER or by cleavage of sphingomyelin by phosphodiesterases (sphingomyelinases) the multiple different metabolites of the sphingolipid pathway, which are distinct by even a single double bond, can have quite varied cellular functions. the binding of ceramide to LC3-II can be detected using anti-ceramide and anti-LC3 antibodies by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. anti-ceramide and anti-LC3 antibodies can be detected by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. gangliosides have been implicated in autolysosome morphogenesis. the use of FRET by flow cytometry appears to be highly sensitive to small changes in distance between 2 molecules. however, FRET requires 10 times less biological material than immunoprecipitation. sphingolipids are bioactive molecules that play key roles in regulation of autophagy at various stages. 607 LC3 and ATG5 are not required for the initiation of autophagy, but mediate phagophore expansion and autophagosome formation. the transcriptional induction of LC3 may be necessary to replenish LC3 protein that is turned over during extensive ER stress- and hypoxia-induced autophagy. PPARA and NR1H4 compete for the control of lipophagy in response to fasting and feeding nutritional cues.612 NR1H4 may also inhibit autophagy via inhibition of CREB-CRTC2 complex assembly. pGFP-Atg8a can be used to monitor autophagy in drosophila melanogaster. pGFP-Atg8a can be used to monitor autophagy in drosophila melanogaster. rapl1, Bnip3, Atg4b, Atg12l have been documented at the transcriptional and translational level in several other species (e.g., C. elegans,624 mouse, rat, human,625 trout, Arabidopsis and maize) under conditions of ER stress,602 and diverse types of prolonged (several days) catabolic situations including cancer cachexia, diabetes mellitus, uremia and fasting. TFEB is phosphorylated by MTORC1 on the lysosomal surface, preventing its nuclear translocation. TFEB activity is regulated by starvation and is controlled by both MAPK1/ERK2- and MTOR-mediated phosphorylation at specific serine residues. TFEB localization may also be studied to monitor MTOR activity. but due to the low expression levels of TFEB in most cells and tissues, it may be difficult to visualize the endogenous protein. a TFEB nuclear translocation assay was developed in a stably transfected cell line. most of the ATG genes do not show significant changes in mRNA levels when autophagy is induced. even increases in LC3 mRNA can be quite modest and are cell type- and organism-dependent. however, changes in mRNA levels are not sufficient evidence of autophagy induction. posttranslational modification of ATG proteins Autophagy is controlled by posttranslational modification (PTM) of ATG proteins such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination, acetylation, oxidation and cleavage. the global deacetylation of proteins can be conveniently measured by quantitative immunofluorescence with antibodies specifically recognizing acetylated lysine residues. the general strategy is first to label cellular proteins by incorporation of a radioactive amino acid (e.g., [14C]- or [3H]-leucine, [14C]-valine or [35S]-methionine) the inclusion of the appropriate unlabeled amino acid (i.e., valine, leucine or methionine) in the starvation medium is necessary. the complementary approach of using compounds that block other degradative pathways, such as proteasome inhibitors, may cause unexpected results. the use of stable isotopes in quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics allows the recording of degradation rates of thousands of proteins simultaneously. a modified version of this marker, GST-BHMT, can be expressed in other cell lines where it behaves similar to the wild-type protein. neomycin phosphotransferase II-GFP (NeoR-GFP) fusion protein is a target of autophagy. a molecular genetic modification that eliminates the first 60 amino acids prevents the mutant (Pho860) from entering the ER, leaving the zymogen in the cytosol. the resulting activation of the zymogen can be measured by enzymatic assays for phosphatase activity. in the case of labeled amino acids, a nonlabeled chase is added where the tracer amino acid is present in excess. perfused organ system also allows for testing the reversibility of effects on proteolysis and the use of autophagy-specific inhibitors in the same experimental preparation. we recommend against holding individual sample tubes on a vortex. deletion of PHO8 can affect yeast cell physiology, especially depending on growth conditions. yeast pexophagy uses the processing of Pex14-GFP and Pot1/Fox3/thiolase-GFP,682,683. mitophagy requires both the Slt2 and Hog1 signaling pathways. phosphorylation of Slt2 and Hog1 can be monitored with commercially available phosphorylation. catalase activity is a useful marker only when peroxisomal catalases are the only such enzymes present or when activities of different catalases can be distinguished. only one of these gene products, Cta1, is localized in peroxisomes. protein interactions in the autophagic pathway.705-707 In this assay, a protein of interest is cloned into a vector containing one half of a fluorescent reporter. a second protein is cloned into a different vector containing the other half of the reporter. a fluorescent signal is reconstituted, which can be monitored by confocal microscopy. mitophagy can be induced by culturing the cells in a nonfermentable carbon source to post-log phase. this type of mitophagy reflects a quality-control function that culls defective mitochondria that accumulate in nondividing, respiring cells. e protein Tsc13 is involved in the synthesis of very-long-chain fatty acids. Upon starvation the NVJs bulge into the vacuole and subsequently a PMN-vesicle pinches off into the vacuole. PMN vesicles thus contain nuclear material and are limited by 3 membranes with the outermost derived from the vacuole. late nucleophagy (LN) is another type of selective degradation of the nucleus. LN induction occurs in the absence of the essential PMN proteins Nvj1 and Vac8 and, therefore, the formation of NVJs. the degradation of nuclei in spores requires the nonselective autophagy machinery, whereas conserved components of the PMN pathway such as Vac8 and Tsc13 are dispensable for nuclear breakdown during plant infection. autophagic bodies can be accumulated within the vacuole, allowing for an increased sample size. it is best to use a strain background that is pep4 vps4 to prevent the breakdown of the autophagic bodies, and to eliminate confounding vesicles. processing assay is easy to perform and is suitable for analysis by microscopy as well as western blotting. however, particular care is needed to obtain quantitative data for GFP-Atg8, Pex14-GFP or Om45-GFP. an alternative is an organelle-targeted Pho860 assay. b. Aggrephagy Aggrephagy is the selective removal of aggregates by macroautophagy. this process can be followed in vitro (in cell culture) and in vivo (in mice) by monitoring levels of an aggregate-prone protein such as an expanded polyglutamine (polyQ)-containing protein or mutant SNCA/-synuclein. levels are quantified by immunofluorescence, immunogold labeling or traditional immunoblot. autophagic degradation of endogenous aggregates such as lipofuscin can be monitored by fluorescence microscopy. 99% of lipofuscin particles are located in the autophagosomes/lysosomes. an impairment of macroautophagy leads to free lipofuscin in the cytosol. both paternal mitochondria and membranous organelles are eliminated by the 16-cell stage (100\u2013120 min post-fertilization) the degradation process can be monitored in living embryos with GFP::ubiquitin. TEM can also be used to demonstrate the presence of mitochondria within autophagosomes in the early embryo. p-S65-Ub is formed by the kinase PINK1 specifically upon mitochondrial stress. it is amplified in presence of the E3 Ub ligase PARK2. 746 p-S65-Ub antibodies have been used to demonstrate stress-induced activation of PINK1. the p-S65-Ub signal is almost undetectable in nonstressed cells. it is strongly induced in a PINK1 kinase-dependent manner during its stabilization on the outer mitochondrial membrane. the p-S65-Ub staining is almost undetectable in nonstressed cells. mitochondria should be labeled by a matrix-targeted fluorescent protein transfection. it is important to allow at least 48 h of transient expression for sufficient targeting/import of mitochondrial GFP/RFP prior to analyzing mitophagy. mitochondria should be labeled by a matrix-targeted fluorescent protein transfection. TEM can be used to demonstrate the presence of mitochondria in autophagosomes during mitophagy. it can be coupled with bafilomycin A1 treatment to prevent fusion with the lysosome. the fusion process of mitophagosomes with hydrolase-containing lysosomes represents the next step in the degradation process. the fusion process of mitophagosomes with hydrolase-containing lysosomes represents the next step in the degradation process. mitochondria can also be quantitatively monitored using a mitochondria-targeted version of the pH-dependent Keima protein. the peak of the excitation spectrum shifts from 440 nm to 586 nm when mitochondria are delivered to acidic lysosomes. neurons transfected with mito-Keima were visualized using mitochondria-targeted Keima. quantification of red dots suggests increased mitophagy in wild-type PINK1 but not in the kinase dead (kd) PINK1K219M-overexpressing neurons. mitochondrial content in response to mitophagic stimuli can be quantified at the single-cell level. a reliable estimation of mtDNA can be performed by real-time PCR of the MT-ND2 gene expressed as a ratio of mtDNA:nuclear DNA by normalizing to that of TERT (telomerase reverse transcriptase) genomic DNA. the spectrophotometric measurement of the activity of CS (citrate synthase) can also be used to estimate the mitochondrial mass. a milder mitophagy stimulus has been developed that relies on antimycin A and oligomycin, inhibitors of the electron transport chain and ATP synthase. this treatment is less toxic, and the resulting damage is time dependent. another method to induce mitophagy is by expressing and activating a mitochondrially localized fluorescent protein photosensitizer. the process of pexophagy is prominent and well described in yeast cells. the process of pexophagy is prominent and well described in yeast cells. however, relatively little work has been done in the area of selective mammalian peroxisome degradation by autophagy. an alternative approach uses a peroxisome-specific tandem fluorochrome assay (RFP-EGFP localizing to peroxisomes by the C-terminal addition of the tripeptide SKL), which has been used to demonstrate the involvement of ACBD5/ATG37, NBR1 and SQSTM1 in mammalian pexophagy. mitochondrial proteins accumulate differentially with deficiency of either. mitochondrial proteins accumulate differentially with deficiency of either. this results in preferential degradation of mitochondrial outer membrane proteins by the proteasome. however, staining with MitoTracker dyes depends on mitochondrial membrane potential. PINK1 and PARK2 also participate in an ATG gene-independent pathway for lysosomal degradation of small mitochondria-derived vesicles. the PINK1-PARK2 mitophagy pathway is also transcriptionally upregulated in response to starvation-triggered generalized autophagy. surface Plot, or luminance intensity height, is proportional to the colocalization strength of the colocalized structures. arrows pointing up indicate an increase in the colocalization, while arrows pointing down show a decrease. chloroplast turnover has been considered to occur via an autophagy-type mechanism. chlorophagy can occur via several routes, including the encapsulation of whole chloroplasts or the budding of chloroplast material into small distinct autophagic vesicles called Rubisco-containing bodies. stromules are part of the chlorophagy process, by which the stromule tips presumably containing unwanted or damaged chloroplast material are engulfed by autophagic membranes. deiminase to remove arginine from the culture medium or by using arginine-dropout medium. multiple giant autophagosomes or autolysosomes containing leaked nuclear DNA can be detected. chromatophagy-related autophagosomes also contain parts of the nuclear outer-membrane. the engulfed cytoplasm is identical to the outer cytoplasm, containing ribosomes, vesicles and even larger organelles. it was suggested that plastolysomes digest themselves together with their cytoplasmic cargo, and transform into lytic vacuoles. this process was also demonstrated in petal cells of Dendrobium813 and in Brassica napus microspores experimentally induced towards embryogenesis. lipophagy requires the core autophagic machinery and can be monitored by following triglyceride content, or total lipid levels using BODIPY 493/503 or HCS LipidTOX neutral lipid stains with fluorescence microscopy. this commonly used fluorescent marker of neutral lipids is highly susceptible to bleed-through into the other fluorescence channels. cytoplasmic lipases that are unrelated to lysosomal degradation must be considered. j. Lysophagy is a selective macroautophagy process that participates in cellular quality control through lysosome turnover. by eliminating ruptured lysosomes, lysophagy prevents the subsequent activation of the inflammasome complex. reticulophagy is a type of selective macroautophagy of the ER. it depends on the autophagy receptors Atg39 and Atg40.839 ER stress also triggers an autophagic response,840. reticulophagy is selective and should be able to act in ER quality control. n. RNA-silencing components Several components of the RNA-silencing machinery are selectively degraded by autophagy in different organisms. this was first shown for the plant AGO1/ARGONAUTE1 protein, a key component of the Arabidopsis RNA-induced silencing complex. AIN-1 colocalizes with SQST-1 that acts as a receptor for autophagic degradation of ubiquitinated protein aggregates. gluconeogenic enzymes such as fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (Fbp1/FBPase), malate dehydrogenase (Mdh2) and isocitrate lyase (Icl1) constitute the cargo of the vacuole import and degradation pathway. the amount of marker proteins in the cytosol compared to the Vid vesicles can be examined by differential centrifugation. in this case, yeast cells are lysed and subjected to differential centrifugation. the distribution of Vid vesicles containing cargo can be examined with antibodies against Vid24, Vid30, Sec28 and Fbp1.859-861. many in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that genes encoding macrophagy components are required for host defense against infection by bacteria, parasites and viruses. xenophagy is often used as a term to describe autophagy of microbial pathogens, mediating their capture and delivery to lysosomes for degradation. the currently available criteria to differentiate LAP from macroautophagy include: i) LAP involves LC3 recruitment to bacteria in a manner that requires ROS production by an NADPH oxidase. most cells express at least one member of the NADPH oxidase family. macroautophagy can also target pathogens within phagosomes, damaged phagosomes or the cytosol. however, subsequent studies have revealed that macroautophagy can also target pathogens within phagosomes, damaged phagosomes or the cytosol. however, many structures can be visualized, with any number of membranes encompassing microbes. the impact of ICP34.5's targeting of BECN1 on viral replication in cultured permissive cells is minimal, but it has a significant impact on pathogenesis in vivo. viral BCL2 proteins encoded by large DNA viruses are able to inhibit autophagy by interacting with BECN1565 through their BH3 homology domain. hepatitis C virus requires beCN1, ATG4B, ATG5 and ATG12 for initiating replication. autophagosomes are formed in an ATG5- and ATG7-independent manner. however, there may be other macroautophagy-like pathways that have yet to be characterized. infecting pathogens can selectively modulate antibacterial autophagy (i.e., xenophagy) without influencing basal autophagy. this may help pathogens ensure prolonged cellular survival. this consideration particularly limits the sensitivity of LC3 western blots. zymophagy can be monitored by TEM, identifying autophagosomes containing secretory granules, by following SQSTM1 degradation by western blot. colocalization of PRSS1/trypsinogen (which is packaged within zymogen granules) and LC3 can also be observed by indirect or direct immunofluorescence microscopy. yeast Cvt pathway is unique in that it is a biosynthetic route that utilizes the autophagy-related protein machinery. other types of selective autophagy are degradative. each process has its own marker proteins. in S. cerevisiae there are 2 genes, CTT1 and CTA1, encoding catalase activity. only one of these gene products, Cta1, is localized in peroxisomes. bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) may be useful to study protein-protein interactions in the autophagic pathway. a protein of interest is cloned into a vector containing one half of a fluorescent reporter. a second protein is cloned into a different vector containing the other half of the reporter. pexophagy can be induced by culturing the cells in a nonfermentable carbon source to post-log phase. in addition, mitophagy can be induced because the energy demand is lower at post-log phase and the mitochondrial mass exceeds the cell's needs. this type of mitophagy reflects a quality-control function that culls defective mitochondria that accumulate in nondividing, respiring cells. protein Vac8.718 Nvj1 further recruits the ER-membrane protein Tsc13. Upon starvation the NVJs bulge into the vacuole and a PMN-vesicle pinches off into the vacuole. PMN vesicles thus contain nuclear material and are limited by 3 membranes with the outermost derived from the vacuole and the 2 inner ones from the nuclear ER. late nucleophagy (LN) is another type of selective degradation of the nucleus. LN induction occurs in the absence of the essential PMN proteins Nvj1 and Vac8 and, therefore, the formation of NVJs. macroautophagy mediates degradation of basal hyphal organelles such as peroxisomes, mitochondria and entire nuclei. the degradation of nuclei in spores requires the nonselective autophagy machinery. autophagy.505,729 Accordingly, it is possible to monitor the processing of prApe1 when overexpressed, or in certain mutant strains to follow autophagy induction. however, it must be kept in mind that the sequestering vesicles are substantially smaller than typical autophagosomes generated during nonselective autophagy. the GFP-Atg8 processing assay is easy to perform and is suitable for analysis by microscopy as well as western blotting. however, particular care is needed to obtain quantitative data for GFP-Atg8, Pex14-GFP or Om45-GFP processing assays. b. Aggrephagy Aggrephagy is the selective removal of aggregates by macroautophagy. this process can be followed in vitro (in cell culture) and in vivo (in mice) by monitoring the levels of an aggregate-prone protein such as an expanded polyglutamine (polyQ)-containing protein. autophagic degradation of endogenous aggregates such as lipofuscin can be monitored by fluorescence microscopy. the ratio of luciferase activity from these 2 constructs can be calculated to determine autophagic flux. soluble polyQ reporters can be degraded by the proteasome. both paternal mitochondria and membranous organelles are eliminated by the 16-cell stage (100\u2013120 min post-fertilization) the degradation process can be monitored in living embryos with GFP::ubiquitin. changes are due to selective mitophagy or increased mitochondrial degradation during nonselective autophagy. p-S65-Ub is formed by the kinase PINK1 specifically upon mitochondrial stress. 746 p-S65-Ub antibodies have been used to demonstrate stress-induced activation of PINK1. function mutation (Q456X) were treated with valinomycin for the indicated times. p-S65-Ub signal is almost undetectable in nonstressed cells. p-S65-Ub signal is strongly induced in a PINK1 kinase-dependent manner. mitochondria should be labeled by a matrix-targeted fluorescent protein transfection. it is important to allow at least 48 h of transient expression for sufficient targeting/import of mitochondrial GFP/RFP prior to analyzing mitophagy. mitochondrial cations include a chloromethyl group and a fluorescent moiety. colocalization analyses of mitochondria and autophagosomes provide an indication of the degree of autophagic sequestration. TEM can be used to demonstrate the presence of mitochondria within autophagosomes during mitophagy. autophagosomes in bafilomycin A1-treated cells indicate selective mitophagy in PINK1-deficient cells. fusion process of mitophagosomes with hydrolase-containing lysosomes represents the next step in the degradation process. mitochondria can be quantitatively monitored using a mitochondria-targeted version of the pH-dependent Keima protein. a mitochondrially-targeted version of the tandem mCherry-GFP fluorescent reporter can be used to monitor mitophagic flux. neurons transfected with mito-Keima were visualized using mitochondria-targeted Keima. quantification of red dots suggests increased mitophagy in wild-type PINK1 but not in the kinase dead (kd) PINK1K219M-overexpressing neurons. mitochondrial content in response to mitophagic stimuli can be quantified at the single-cell level. a reliable estimation of mtDNA can be performed by real-time PCR of the MT-ND2 gene expressed as a ratio of mtDNA:nuclear DNA. a reliable estimation of mtDNA can be performed by real-time PCR of the MT-ND2 gene expressed as a ratio of mtDNA:nuclear DNA by normalizing to that of TERT. a milder mitophagy stimulus has been developed that relies on antimycin A and oligomycin, inhibitors of the electron transport chain and ATP synthase. this treatment is less toxic, and the resulting damage is time dependent. another method to induce mitophagy is by expressing and activating a mitochondrially localized fluorescent protein photosensitizer. the process of pexophagy is prominent and well described in yeast cells. however, relatively little work has been done in the area of selective mammalian peroxisome degradation by autophagy. degradation of excess organelles is induced by drug withdrawal. an alternative approach uses a peroxisome-specific tandem fluorochrome assay (RFP-EGFP localizing to peroxisomes by the C-terminal addition of the tripeptide SKL), which has been used to demonstrate the involvement of ACBD5/ATG37, NBR1 and SQSTM1 in mammalian pexophagy. mitochondrial proteins accumulate differentially with deficiency of either, indicating nonredundant roles for these E3 ubiquitin ligases in mitophagy. this results in preferential degradation of mitochondrial outer membrane proteins by the proteasome, while inner membrane proteins and mitochondrial DNA788 remain intact. PINK1 and PARK2 also participate in an ATG gene-independent pathway for lysosomal degradation of small mitochondria-derived vesicles. the PINK1-PARK2 mitophagy pathway is also transcriptionally upregulated in response to starvation-triggered generalized autophagy. the upper channels show TOMM20 (green channel), BrdU (for visualization of newly synthesized mitochondrial DNA, red channel) and merged fluorescence channels. surface Plot profile corresponds to the spatial pattern of software thresholded colocalized structures (white spots) arrows pointing up indicate an increase in the colocalization, while arrows pointing down show a decrease. chloroplasts produce long tubes called stromules that project out from the organelle outer membrane. the stromule tips presumably containing unwanted or damaged chloroplast material are engulfed by autophagic membranes using ESCRTII endocytic machinery. arginine starvation can be achieved by adding purified arginine deiminase to remove arginine from the culture medium or by using arginine-dropout medium. multiple giant autophagosomes or autolysosomes containing leaked nuclear DNA can be detected. plastids are characterized by formation of invaginations in their double-membrane envelopes that eventually generate a cytoplasmic compartment within the plastidial stroma. the engulfed cytoplasm is identical to the outer cytoplasm, containing ribosomes, vesicles and even larger organelles. plastolysomes digest themselves together with their cytoplasmic cargo, and transform into lytic vacuoles. lipophagy requires the core autophagic machinery and can be monitored by following triglyceride content, or total lipid levels using BODIPY 493/503 or HCS LipidTOX neutral lipid stains with fluorescence microscopy. this commonly used fluorescent marker of neutral lipids is highly susceptible to bleed-through into the other fluorescence channels. j. Lysophagy is a selective macroautophagy process that participates in cellular quality control through lysosome turnover. by eliminating ruptured lysosomes, lysophagy prevents the subsequent activation of the inflammasome complex and innate immune response. oxiapoptophagy could characterize the effect of cytotoxic oxysterols. reticulophagy has been termed ER-phagy or reticulophagy. it depends on the autophagy receptors Atg39 and Atg40.839 ER stress. ribophagy is antagonized by the deubiquitinase Ubp3-Bre5 complex. n. RNA-silencing components Several components of the RNA-silencing machinery are selectively degraded by autophagy. this was first shown for the plant AGO1/ARGONAUTE1 protein. AIN-1 colocalizes with SQST-1 that acts as a receptor for autophagic degradation of ubiquitinated protein aggregates. gluconeogenic enzymes such as fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (Fbp1/FBPase), malate dehydrogenase (Mdh2), isocitrate lyase (Icl1) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase ( the amount of marker proteins in the cytosol compared to the Vid vesicles can be examined by differential centrifugation. the distribution of Vid vesicles containing cargo can be examined using FM 4\u201364, a lipophilic dye that primarily stains endocytic compartments and the vacuole limiting membrane. many in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that genes encoding macroautophagy components are required for host defense against infection by bacteria, parasites and viruses. xenophagy is often used as a term to describe autophagy of microbial pathogens, mediating their capture and delivery to lysosomes for degradation. the currently available criteria to differentiate LAP from macroautophagy include: i) LAP involves LC3 recruitment to bacteria in a manner that requires ROS production by an NADPH oxidase. CLEM is expected to show single-membrane structures that are LC3+ with LAP. macroautophagy can also target pathogens within phagosomes, damaged phagosomes or the cytosol. however, subsequent studies have revealed that macroautophagy can also target pathogens within phagosomes, damaged phagosomes or the cytosol. the HSV-1 ICP34.5 protein inhibits autophagy by targeting BECN1.892. however, it has a significant impact on pathogenesis in vivo. viral BCL2 proteins, encoded by large DNA viruses, are able to inhibit autophagy by interacting with BECN1565. gue virus replication requires the ER rather than autophagosomes,905. coronaviruses and japanese encephalitis virus use a nonlipidated version of LC3. hepatitis C virus requires BECN1, ATG4B, ATG5 and ATG12 for initiating replication. infecting pathogens can selectively modulate antibacterial autophagy (i.e., xenophagy) without influencing basal autophagy. this may help pathogens ensure prolonged cellular (i.e., host) survival. a key consideration has recently emerged in studying xenophagy. autophagy can be monitored by TEM, identifying autophagosomes containing secretory granules. colocalization of PRSS1/trypsinogen (which is packaged within zymogen granules) and LC3, or of GFP-ubiquitin (which is recruited to the activated granules) can also be observed. autophagic sequestration assays constitute marker-independent methods to measure the sequestration of autophagic cargo into autophagosomal compartments. markers can be measured using either an (electro)injected, inert cytosolic marker such as [3H]-raffinose911 or an endogenous cytosolic protein such as LDH/lactate dehydrogenase,912. sequestration assays are typically done by monitoring protease protection of an autophagosome marker or a cargo protein. in yeast, sequestration assays are typically done by monitoring protease protection of an autophagosome marker or a cargo protein. lactate hydrolysis can be used to monitor the overall autophagic pathway (autophagic lactolysis) inhibitors may affect sequestration indirectly, for example, by modifying the uptake and metabolism of autophagy-suppressive amino acids (see Autophagy inhibitors and inducers) electro-injection of radiolabeled probes is technically demanding. but the use of an endogenous cytosolic protein probe is very simple. another concern with electro-injection is that it can affect cellular physiology. prApe1 assay avoids these problems, but the signal-to-noise ratio is typically substantially lower. it should be possible to use this assay in other cell types. protease protection of GFP-LC3 and GFP-SQSTM1 has been analyzed in HeLa cells. the presence and absence of bafilomycin A1 or following GFP-LC3 after starvation and recovery in amino acid-rich medium. the inhibitory effect must be strong and the efficiency of the inhibitor needs to be tested. treatment with cycloheximide causes a potent increase in MTORC1 activity. the labeling of DQ-BSA is so extensive that the fluorophore is self-quenched. this compound is so extensive that the fluorophore is self-quenched. it is useful for detecting intracellular proteolytic activity as a measure of a functional lysosome. wortmannin causes swelling of late endosomes931. in this case, the lysosomal compartment can be labeled with DQ-BSA overnight before treating the cells with the drugs. colocalization of autophagosomes can also be monitored. e.g., acid hydrolases are found primarily in membrane-bound compartments. such a change in enzyme accessibility can be used to follow the time course of an exogenously induced autophagic process. similar results can be obtained with isopycnic centrifugation where particles enter a density gradient. morphometric/stereological methods942 must be used to determine the volume occupied by a given class of particles, as well as the size distribution and average size of the particle class. during isolation it is essential to always use iso-osmotic solutions to avoid hypotonic or hypertonic disruption. the isolation of intact lysosome-related organelles is strongly discouraged. lysosomes are actually a very heterogeneous pool of organelles. lysosomes are a very heterogeneous pool of organelles that simply fulfill 5 classical criteria. autophagy can be monitored in tissue (e.g., skeletal muscle, liver, brain and retina) in vivo in transgenic mice systemically expressing GFP-LC3,153,606,949,950 or in other models by transfection with GFP-LC3 plasmids or in transgenic strains. cleavage of GFP-LC3 to generate free GFP can be evaluated as one method to monitor the completion of autophagy. this has been successfully performed in mouse liver,257,747 suggesting the cleavage assay may also be applied to in vivo studies. however, the accumulation of free GFP in the mouse brain is minimal after autophagy is induced with rapamycin. s.953 The use of different serotypes of adeno-associated virus could be used to transduce other cell types at the CNS. this method allows a reproducible and sensitive mCherry-GFP-LC3 detection, and a strong LC3 flux when animals are treated with autophagy inducers.955 confocal laser scanning microscopy can be a suitable system for studying autophagic structures. e marrow transfer has been used to document in vivo the role of autophagy in the reverse cholesterol transport pathway. a study shows that TGM2 protein levels decrease in mouse liver in vivo upon starvation in an autophagy-dependent manner. it is also possible to analyze tissues ex vivo, and these studies can be particularly helpful in assessing autophagic flux. exercise may be a particularly appropriate stimulus to use for assessing macroautophagy in skeletal muscle. data can be obtained by treating mice with chloroquine,972 leupeptin969,978 or colchicine224. this type of analysis can also be done with liver. autophagy has been evaluated in placentas from normal pregnancies981-983. placentas from acidotic newborns developing neonatal encephalopathy exhibit a higher level of LC3-II than placentas from newborn without neonatal encephalopathy. retina is a very suitable organ for ex vivo and in vivo autophagy determination. retina is readily accessible and can be maintained in organotypic cultures for some time. only 4 h of leupeptin injection in fasted mice allows for autophagic flux assessment. staining with MDC is not a sufficient method for monitoring autophagy. it is important to show whether this is due to a shutdown of the lysosomal system, causing an accumulation of autophagosomes. lysosomal enzymes can be detected by IHC or classical histochemistry. the major hurdle with in vivo analyses is the identification of autophagy-specific substrates and the ability to \u201cblock\u201d autophagosome degradation with a compound such as bafilomycin A1. to truly measure in vivo autophagic flux using LC3-II as a biomarker, it is necessary to block lysosomal degradation of the protein. the bioavailability of the agent needs to be considered. omeprazole interacts with the V-ATPase and probably inhibits autophagosome-lysosome fusion. chloroquine treatment should be used for short times and at doses that do not induce severe collateral effects. it is also important to have time-matched controls for in vivo analyses. this is because there may be substantial diurnal changes in basal autophagy. proximal tubule-specific ATG5-deficient mice1002 display a degeneration phenotype earlier than podocyte-specific ATG5-deficient mice,1003. accumulation of ubiquitin may indicate a block in autophagy or inhibition of proteasomal degradation, or it may correspond to structural changes in the substrate proteins that hinder their degradation. autophagy regulators PINK1 and PARK2 show loss-of-function mutations in autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism. alterations in autophagy have also been implicated in other neurological diseases including epilepsies, neurometabolic and neurodevelopmental disorders. ic vacuolar myopathies and cardiomyopathies can also be secondary to treatment with autophagy-inhibiting drugs (chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine and colchicine) autophagy impairment has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of inclusion body myositis, an age-associated inflammatory myopathy. es on NETs by acidified LC3-positive vacuoles in sepsis1034 and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody associated vasculitis.1037 patients with chronic kidney disease also have impaired autophagy activation in leukocytes. autophagy also plays an important role in the development in vitro of giant phagocytes. autophagy-inducing anticancer therapies induce ICD including mitoxantrone, doxorubicin, oxaliplatin, radiotherapy, certain oncolytic viruses and hypericin-based photodynamic therapy. in the setting of Hyp-PDT, ER stress-induced autophagy in human cancer cells suppresses CALR (calreticulin) surface exposure (a danger signal crucial for ICD) new studies have implicated insufficient autophagy in pathogenesis of nonresolving vital organ failure and muscle weakness during critical illness. a block of autophagy with consequent accumulation of autophagy substrates is detected in liver fibrosis,1062,1063 and lysosomal storage diseases. autophagy can play a context-dependent role in modulating danger signaling. all relevant danger signals should be (re-)tested for new agents/therapies in the presence of targeted ablation of autophagy-relevant proteins/genes. cell death In several cases, autophagy has been established as the cause of cell death. claim (b) is stronger than claim (a) and needs to be justified by proof that inhibiting autophagy prevents cell death. it is preferable to replace the term \u201cautophagy-dependent cell death\u201d by other terms such as \u201cautophagy-mediated cell death\u201d unless the criteria in claim (c) above have been satisfied. autophagy can also play an upstream, initiator role in immunity-associated cell death related to the pathogen-triggered hypersensitive response. autophagy is required to protect against starvation-induced cell death, allowing vacuolar developmental cell death to take place instead. a novel form of autophagy-dependent cell death has been described, autosis. cell death can be established in vivo by morphological analysis,1100 and in culture by cell counts and/or measurement of the release of an enzyme such as LDH into the medium. a substantial amount of neuronal cell death occurs during neurogenesis, making it problematic to carry out a correct analysis in vivo or ex vivo. no changes in mitochondrial activity/potential, nor caspase activation or externalization of phosphatidylserine can be accurately used to determine cell death progression. the primary characteristic that makes CMA different from other autophagic variants described in these guidelines is that it does not require formation of intermediate vesicular compartments. a higher degree of confidence can be attained if the association is preferentially with the subset of lysosomes active for CMA (i.e., those containing HSPA8 in their lumen) it is usually better to perform affinity isolation with the protein of interest and then analyze the isolated proteins for the presence of HSPA8 rather than vice versa. general inhibitors of lysosomal proteases block the degradation of proteins delivered to lysosomes by other autophagic and endosomal pathways. the most selective way to block CMA is by knockdown of LAMP2A. the other components involved in CMA, including HSPA8, HSP90AA1, GFAP, and EEF1A/eF1, are all multifunctional cellular proteins. the protein bound to the cytosolic side of lysosomes is inaccessible to the protein that has reached the lysosomal lumen. pre-incubation of lysosomes with lysosomal protease inhibitors is required to prevent the degradation of the translocated substrate inside lysosomes. the difficulties in the adjustment of the amount of protease have led to the development of a second method that is more suitable for laboratories blockage of uptake by pre-incubation of lysosomes with antibodies against the cytosolic tail of LAMP2A also reinforces the hypothesis that the protein is a CMA substrate. in other instances, the interest may be to analyze possible changes in CMA activity under different conditions or in response to different modifications. two different fluorescent probes have been generated to track changes in CMA activity in cultured cells using immunofluorescence or flow cytometry analysis. the assay does not allow measuring accumulation of the substrate (which must unfold for translocation), it is advisable to perform a time-course analysis to determine gradual changes in CMA activity. fluorescent probes measure binding of substrate to lysosomal membranes. in vitro uptake assays are the most efficient way to determine primary changes in CMA independently of changes in other proteolytic systems in the cells. efficiency to take up substrates results from changes in CMA rather than from different levels of lysosomes in the isolated fractions. control of the integrity of the lysosomal membrane and sufficiency of the proteases are also essential to discard the possibility that degradation is occurring outside lysosomes because of leakage. soluble proteins, oligomers and protein aggregates can undergo e-MI. in vitro uptake of e-MI substrates can be reconstituted using isolated late endosomes. in vitro uptake of CMA substrates can only be reconstituted using lysosomes. substrate proteins are ubiquitinated and targeted for lysosomal degradation by chaperone and co-chaperone proteins. substrate protein does not require a KFERQ motif. substrate protein is recognized by the chaperone HSPA8, the small heat shock proteins HSPB6 and HSPB8. monodansylcadaverine,1129 acridine orange,1130 Neutral Red,956 LysoSensor Blue1131 and LysoTracker Red.280,1132 It should be emphasized that whereas these dyes are useful to identify acidified vesicular compartments, they should not be relied upon to compare differences in endosomal or lysosomal pH between cells. cells that overexpress a dominant negative version of the T22N mutant show colocalization of this protein with MDC. in this case fusion with lysosomes is also blocked1136 indicating that MDC does not just label lysosomes. however, the increased labeling of cellular compartments by this dye is prevented by treatment with specific autophagy inhibitors. LysoTracker Red stains lysosomes and can be used to monitor autophagy in Drosophila. lysotracker red stains lysosomes and can be used to monitor autophagy. acidotropic dyes can stain late autophagic vacuoles, but not the initial autophagic vacuole, the early autophagosome. a recently developed dye for monitoring autophagy, Cyto-ID, stains vesicular structures shortly after amino acid deprivation. unlike MDC, Cyto-ID does not show background fluorescence under control conditions and the 2 dyes colocalize only marginally. most chemical inhibitors of autophagy are not entirely specific, and it is important to consider possible dose- and time-dependent effects. some apparently specific Atg gene products may have autophagy-independent roles (e.g., ATG5 in cell death, and the PIK3C3/VPS34-containing complexes) wortmannin may be considered as an alternative to 3-MA for autophagy inhibition. but wortmannin can induce the formation of vacuoles that may have the appearance of autophagosomes. studies have demonstrated that inhibition of autophagy with 3-MA or wortmannin can have effects on cytokine transcription, processing and secretion. a knockout of Pik3c3 specifically in the kidney glomerular podocytes indicates that there is no compensation by other classes of PtdIns3Ks or related Atg genes. cycloheximide, a commonly used protein synthesis inhibitor in mammals, is also an inhibitor of sequestration in vivo. autophagic compartments cause the accumulation of sequestered material in either autophagosomes or autolysosomes, or both, because they allow autophagic sequestration to proceed. the main categories of these types of inhibitors include vinca alkaloids (e.g., vinblastine) and other microtubule poisons that inhibit fusion. lysosomal damage mediated by betulinic acid is capable of compromising autophagy without any incremental damage when lysosomal function is altered by lysosomal inhibitors. lysosomal proteases fall into 3 general groups, cysteine, aspartic acid and serine proteases. MG132 (Z-leu-leu-leu-al) and its related peptide aldehydes are commonly used as proteasomal inhibitors, but they can also inhibit certain lysosomal hydrolases such as cathepsins and calpains. however, any positive results using MG132 do not rule out the possibility of involvement of the autophagy-lysosomal system. bafilomycin A1 is often used at a final concentration of 100 nM. but much lower concentrations such as 1 nM may be sufficient to inhibit autophagic-lysosomal degradation. lysosomotropic compounds can increase the rate of autophagosome formation by inhibiting MTORC1. this mechanism may be cell-type specific, as other studies report that chloroquine prevents autolysosome clearance and degradation of cargo content. however, it is not known why these drugs cause the accumulation of autophagic compartments. rapamycin and catalytic MTOR inhibitors do not induce a robust autophagy in either cultured primary mouse neurons or human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. this suggests a differential regulation of autophagy in neurons. a specialized class of compounds with,-unsaturated ketone structure tends to induce autophagic cell death, accompanied by changes in mitochondrial morphology. it is incumbent upon the researcher to demonstrate that autophagy is indeed inhibited, by using the methodologies described herein. studies also suggest that microRNAs may be used for blocking gene expression. this is particularly the case in evaluating BECN1, which interacts with anti-apoptotic BCL2 family proteins. 1212 can influence autophagy by either masking any inhibitory effect or compromising autophagy independent of the knockdown probe. nontargeting (scrambled) siRNA or shRNA controls should be used with the respective transfection or transduction methods. the most commonly used inducer of autophagy is rapamycin, an allosteric inhibitor of MTORC1. rapamycin is a major regulatory protein that is part of several signaling pathways. rapamycin controls processes other than autophagy, so rapamycin will ultimately affect many metabolic pathways. lysosomal calcium also modulates autophagy. other cell penetrating peptides, such as Tat-vFLIP or Tat-Beclin 1 (Tat-BECN1), are also potent inducers of autophagy in cultured cells as well as in mice. autophagy can be achieved either through overexpression or post-translational activation of the gene encoding TFEB. adenoviral-mediated expression of the nucleolar transcription factor RRN3/TIF-IA induces autophagy in hepatocytes. gangliosides are implicated in autophagosome morphogenesis. pharmacological or genetic impairment of gangliosides can provide useful information in the analysis of autophagy. gangliosides are implicated in autophagosome morphogenesis. basal autophagy levels should be monitored at different times after addition of fresh medium to cells. this can lead to misinterpretations of what basal autophagy means. the best experimental condition is to monitor the levels of basal autophagy at different times after the addition of fresh medium. a shift to a new medium can be considered a stress situation. it appears to be essential to cultivate the yeast cells for a number of hours to stabilize the level of basal autophagy. the levels of basal autophagy can vary substantially. autophagy regulation by insulin and some amino acids requires volume sensing via integrin-matrix interactions and also intact microtubules. the use of whole embryos makes it possible to investigate autophagy in multipotent cells. the HUGO Nomenclature Committee (http://www.genenames.org/guidelines.html) states that human gene symbols are in the form ATG1 and recommend that proteins use the same designation without italics, as with ATG1. mutants are written for example as ATG1-/-.1258 1. osomes are not acidic, and MDC staining can be seen in autophagy-defective mutants540 and in the absence of autophagy activation. however, in the presence of vinblastine, which blocks fusion with lysosomes, MDC labeling increases, suggesting that MDC does not just label lysosomes. lysotracker red stains lysosomes and can be used to monitor autophagy in Drosophila. a green-fluorescing marker (e.g., GFP-LC3 or MitoTracker Green) should be used to substantiate results obtained with acidotropic dyes. the early autophagosome is not an acidic compartment, whereas amphisomes and autolysosomes are acidic. acidotropic dyes can stain late autophagic vacuoles, but not the initial autophagic vacuole, the early autophagosome. the use of acidotropic dyes to study this process is discouraged. most chemical inhibitors of autophagy are not entirely specific, and it is important to consider possible dose- and time-dependent effects. however, it is generally preferable to analyze specific loss-of-function Atg mutants. the effect of 3-MA is complicated by the fact that it has different temporal patterns of inhibition, causing a long-term suppression of the class I PI3K, but only a transient inhibition of the class III enzyme. wortmannin may be considered as an alternative to 3-MA for autophagy inhibition. xed allele of Pik3c3 has been created.1152 This provides a useful genetic tool that will help in defining the physiological role of the class III PtdIns3K with bona fide specificity. the phenotype resulting from a knockout of Pik3c3 specifically in the kidney glomerular podocytes indicates that there is no compensation by other classes of PtdIns3Ks. most other inhibitory drugs act at post-sequestration steps. they cause the accumulation of sequestered material in either autophagosomes or autolysosomes. they cause the accumulation of sequestered material in either autophagosomes. lysosomal damage mediated by betulinic acid is capable of compromising autophagy without any incremental damage when lysosomal function is altered by lysosomal inhibitors. lysosomal proteases fall into 3 general groups, cysteine, aspartic acid and serine proteases, by as yet unidentified mechanisms. protease inhibitors exert inhibitory effects on lysosomal proteases. degradation of proteins might be blocked through inhibition of cytosolic instead of lysosomal proteases. however, any positive results using MG132 do not rule out the possibility of involvement of the autophagy-lysosomal system. treatment with bafilomycin A1 for extended periods (18 h) can cause significant disruption of mitochondrial network in cultured cells. either bafilomycin A1 or concanamycin A cause swelling of the Golgi in plants. lysosomal pH may have indirect effects on the cell. chloroquine reduces the colocalization of LC3 and LysoTracker. this mechanism might be cell-type specific, as other studies report that chloroquine prevents autolysosome clearance and degradation of cargo content. catalytic MTOR inhibitors are more potent, and hence stronger autophagy agonists in most cell lines. rapamycin may fail to activate autophagy in cultured primary neurons, despite its potent stimulation of autophagy in some cancer cell lines. a number of compounds can also be quite efficient autophagy inducers in neurons. a specialized class of compounds with,-unsaturated ketone structure tends to induce autophagic cell death accompanied by changes in mitochondrial morphology. e.g., in primary or immortalized atg-/- MEFs, 540 plant T-DNA or transposon insertion mutants,282,1205 or in vivo using transgenic knockout models1206,1207. studies also suggest that microRNAs may be used for blocking gene expression. inducible knockout systems may be useful to overcome this concern. some of these can influence autophagy by either masking any inhibitory effect or compromising autophagy independent of the knockdown probe. however, some cell-types of the immune system seem to tolerate loss of autophagy fairly well. the most commonly used inducer of autophagy is rapamycin, an allosteric inhibitor of MTORC1. the most commonly used inducer of autophagy is rapamycin, an allosteric inhibitor of MTORC1. rapamycin is a major regulatory protein that controls processes other than autophagy. lysosomes could also play an important role in autophagy induction. the lysosomal TPCN/two-pore channel is activated by nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) it can selectively be inhibited by the TPCN blocker NED-19 or by pre-incubation with BAPTA. the mechanism by which valproic acid stimulates autophagy is not entirely clear but may occur due to inhibition of the histone deacetylase Rpd3. this negatively regulates the transcription of ATG genes (mostnotably ATG81233) and via deacetylation of Atg3, controls Atg8 lipidation. tamoxifen acts by blocking cholesterol biosynthesis, and that the sterol balance may determine whether autophagy acts in a protective versus cytotoxic manner. screens have identified small molecules that induce autophagy independently of rapamycin and allow the removal of misfolded or aggregate-prone proteins. basal autophagy basal levels of LC3-II or GFP-LC3 puncta may change according to the time after addition of fresh medium to cells. this can lead to misinterpretations of what basal autophagy means. the best experimental condition is to monitor levels of basal autophagy at different times after the addition of fresh medium. the cell under study must be identified beforehand to know the time needed to reduce basal autophagy. a similar caution must be exercised with regard to cell culture density and hypoxia. a shift to a new medium can be considered a stress situation. autophagy promoters, inhibitors and measurement techniques must be empirically determined. differences may also be seen between in vivo or perfused organ studies and cell culture analyses. INS/insulin has no effect on proteolysis in suspended rat hepatocytes. for mammals we follow the recommendations of the International Committee on Standardized Genetic Nomenclature for Mice (http://www.informatics.jax.org/mgihome/nomen/), which dictates the designations Atg1, atg1 and ATG1 (for all rodents) and the guidelines for human genes established by the HUGO Nomenclature Committee (http://www.genenames.org/guidelines.html) fluorescent reporter fusions of LGG-1/Atg8 with GFP, DsRED or mCherry have been used to monitor autophagy in vivo, in the nematode. mCherry puncta may not be a good readout to monitor autophagy in C. elegans. arrows show representative GFP::LGG-1-positive punctate areas that label pre-autophagosomal and autophagosomal structures. the relative levels of PE-conjugated and unconjugated GFP::LGG-1 were determined by western blotting. these figures were modified from data previously published in ref. 1267, Kang, C., Y.J. You, and L. Avery. 2007. Systemic regulation of starvation response in early C. elegans embryos. endogenous LGG-1 puncta are absent in atg-3, atg-7, atg-5 and atg-10 mutant embryos,633,1261. a variety of protein aggregates, including PGL granules (PGL-1-PGL-3-SEPA-1) and the C. elegans SQSTM1 homolog SQST-1, are selectively degraded. gans TP53 ortholog, cep-1, increases autophagosome accumulation1272. bec-1- and cep-1-regulated autophagy is also required for optimal life-span extension. 1274 FRH-1 silencing also induces mitophagy in an evolutionarily conserved manner. DT40 cells are highly proliferative, and knockout cells can be easily reconstituted with cDNAs by retroviral gene transfer. DT40 cells mount an autophagic response upon starvation in EBSS,1277. lipidation of LC3 is observed during starvation, and can be blocked with a short-term incubation with 3-MA or chloroquine. commercially available antibodies for mammalian LC3 and GABARAP have been reported to detect the chicken counterparts in western blots. DT40 cells release avian leukosis virus into the medium. the 3\u2032-long terminal repeat has integrated upstream of the MYC gene. both circumstances might influence basal and starvation-induced autophagy. clonal mutant cells are induced that either overexpress the gene of interest, or silence the gene through expression of a transgenic RNA interference construct. in such an analysis, autophagy in these genetically distinct cells is always compared to neighboring cells of the same tissue. clonal analysis should be an integral part of in vivo Drosophila studies when possible. cultured Drosophila cells (l[2]mbn or S2) can be stably transfected with GFP fused to Drosophila Atg8a. stable S2 cells with GFP-Atg8a under control of a 2-kb Atg8a 5\u2032 UTR are available. mCherry-Atg18 is displayed in punctate patterns that are very similar to mCherry-Atg8a. mCherry-Atg18 is displayed in punctate patterns that are very similar to mCherry-Atg18. autophagy exerts a unique function to sculpt the cytoplasm. mature autophagic vacuoles engulf organelles, such as mitochondria and ribosomes, whose presence would impair the flexibility of the cells. one erythroblast (red arrow) has the morphology of a live cell with several autophagic vacuoles that have engulfed cytoplasmic organelles. the other erythroblast (black arrow) has the electron lipidation of the cytosolic form of LC3B into the lipidated LC3-II form is controlled by EPO (erythropoietin), the erythroid-specific growth factor that ensures survival of the maturing erythroid cells. the importance of autophagy for RBC production has been established through the use of mutant mice lacking genes encoding proteins of the autophagy machinery. autophagy appears to be involved in many normal developmental processes such as sexual and asexual reproduction. autophagy also affects conidial germination under nitrogen-limiting conditions. most studies on autophagy in filamentous fungi have involved deleting key genes necessary for autophagy. most commonly, ATG1, ATG4 and/or ATG8 have been deleted. most commonly, the deletion(s) affects autophagy. autophagosomes can be tracked in large numbers using kymographs traced across the hyphal axis. autophagosomes normally fuse with the vacuole in a Rab7-dependent manner. however, should Rab7 fusogenic activity be mutationally inactivated, autophagosomes can traffic to the endosomes in a RabB/Rab5- and CORVET-dependent manner. macroautophagic degradation of whole nuclei observed in A. oryzae721. autophagosome biogenesis also observed using a PtdIns3P-binding GFP-tagged FYVE domain probe in mutant cells lacking RabB/Rab5. autophagy is a target for some widespread food preservatives used to prevent yeast-dependent spoilage. for example, the effect of benzoic acid is exacerbated when concurrent with nitrogen starvation. 1328 Practical application of these findings would also require extending this research to other relevant food spoilage yeast species. the primary method currently being used to monitor autophagy is following the formation of autophagosomes and autolysosomes by TEM. this technique can be combined with cytochemical and immunohistochemical detection of acid phosphatase as a marker for autolysosomes. phagy-inhibiting drugs are used in combination with other anticancer drugs to increase their potency. however, normal tissues such as kidney induce macroautophagy in response to anticancer drugs to resist their toxicity. further blockade of autophagy could worsen normal tissue toxicity and cause serious side effects. SNCA levels negatively correlate with LC3-II levels in primary T lymphocytes. however, the analysis of SQSTM1 or NBR1 in freshly isolated T lymphocytes fails to reveal any correlation with either LC3-II or SNCA. despite significant postmortem intervals, LC3-II upregulation is correlated with SQSTM1 degradation in neutrophils. biopsies of organs such as the digestive tract, the liver, muscle and the skin are routinely performed. nonsurgical biopsies are preferable since surgery is usually performed in anesthetized and fasting patients, 2 conditions possibly affecting autophagy. a high-power electron micrograph from a brain biopsy showed autophagic vacuoles in a case of ganglioglioma. a major limitation of studying patient biopsies is that only static measurements can be performed. a static marker for phagophore or autophagosome formation needs to be measured. there has been interest in assessing markers of autophagy and autophagic flux in right atrial biopsy samples obtained from patients undergoing cardiac surgery. 1345,1346 Evidence to date suggests that cardiac surgery may be associated with an increase in autophagic flux. the value of using LC3-II staining in tissue as an indication of autophagy or lipophagy is in question. stepwise process can be proposed for linking changes in the autophagic pathway to changes in disease outcome. a subsequent autophagy-modifying intervention should be tested in a randomized study. flux measurements can be made by following ATG8/LC3 turnover using lysosomal protease inhibitors (leupeptin and pepstatin A) or with dyes such as MitoFluor Red 589 or in vivo labeling using LysoTracker Red. autophagy can be induced by RNAi-mediated knockdown of Kazal1,1354,1355 or with rapamycin treatment. in vitro studies with the use of a 3-dimensional culture model of bovine mammary epithelial cells have shown that this process is involved in the formation of fully developed alveoli-like structures. 1365 Earlier studies show that intensified autophagy is observed in bovine MECs at the end of lactation and during the dry period. autophagy inhibitors have considerable side effects and toxicity, hampering their usage. a stepwise approach is used in animal models to provide a proof of concept with an initial evaluation of sequellae. autophagy and all measurements should be interpreted in view of the whole picture. both static measurements reflecting the number of autophagosomes (ultrastructural and/or molecular) and measurements of autophagic substrates as surrogate markers of autophagic flux need to be combined. a genetic intervention can be studied in a small animal model with clinical relevance to the studied disease. studies of the intersegmental muscles did not include molecular analysis of autophagy. the bulk of the larval tissue is removed by autophagy and other forms of proteolysis. bombyx mori is now a representative model among lepidoptera. TOR can be monitored with a phosphospecific antibody against EIF4EBP1.620 Acidotropic dyes have been used as markers for autophagy in silkmoth egg chambers combined always with additional assays. 1370,1371 Acid phosphatase also can be used as a marker for autolysosomal participation in these tissues. work on the tunicate Ciona intestinalis has highlighted the key role of autophagy during the late phases of development in lecithotrophic organisms. this work has also helped in pinpointing the coexistence of autophagy and apoptosis in cells. this type of approach could shed a new light on the close relationship between autophagy and apoptosis. the ovary is a suitable experimental model system for studying autophagy and its interplay with cell death programs due to the presence of post-ovulatory follicles (POFs) and atretic follicles. many freshwater teleosts of commercial value do not spawn spontaneously in captivity. odontoblasts are long-lived dentin-forming postmitotic cells. these cells are aligned at the periphery of the dental pulp. odontoblasts are significantly less protected from environmental insult such as dental caries and trauma. some preliminary results show that LysoTracker Red can be useful reagent to analyze whole-mount planarians. most of the components of the autophagy and MTOR signaling machinery are evolutionarily conserved in planarians. staining with MDC or derivatives (such as monodansylamylamine) is not sufficient for detection of autophagy, as these stains also detect vacuoles. immunolabeled GFP-Atg8 can be detected on the inner and outer membrane of an autophagosome in an Arabidopsis root cell. the processing assay is particularly robust in Arabidopsis and can be observed by western blotting. it is also possible to use plant homologs of SQSTM1 and NBR1 in Arabidopsis1395 as markers for selective autophagy when constructed as fluorescent chimeras. detection of the NBR1 protein level by western blot provides reliable semi-quantitative data about autophagic flux in plant cells. vacuolar vesicles are in fact cytoplasmic/protoplasmic strands. the amount of such strands would not be expected to increase following treatment with concanamycin. other methods described throughout these guidelines can also be used in plants. the unicellular amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum provides another useful system for monitoring autophagy. the unicellular amoeba has a unique life cycle that involves a transition from a unicellular to a multicellular form. development proceeds via the mound stage, the tipped aggregate and a motile slug. classical markers GFP-ATG8 and GFP-ATG18 can be used to detect autophagosomes by fluorescence microscopy. flux assays based on proteolytic cleavage of cytoplasmic substrates are also available. lysosomal protease inhibitors E64 and pepstatin block lysosomal degradative activity in Plasmodium falciparum. however, these inhibitors do not affect ATG8 levels and associated structures, suggesting a need for alternate methodologies to investigate autophagy in this model system. the ciliates maintain spatially differentiated germline and somatic nuclear genomes within a single cell. the germline genome is housed in the micronucleus, while the somatic genome is housed in the macronucleus. lysosomes fuse only to the old parental macronucleus, but other co-existing nuclei are unaffected. rainbow trout salmonids (e.g., salmon, rainbow trout) experience long periods of fasting often associated with seasonal reductions in water temperature and prey availability or spawning migrations. they represent an interesting model system for studying and monitoring the long-term induction of autophagy. blot or by immunofluorescence using antibodies to ATG8/LC3.1425 Flux measurements can be made in a trout cell culture model. it is also possible to monitor the mRNA levels of ATG genes by real-time PCR using primer sequences chosen from trout sequences available in the above-mentioned expressed sequence transcript database. a major challenge in the near future will be to develop for this model the use of RNAi-mediated gene silencing to analyze the role autophagy could play a crucial role in the stress response of this organism. it could energetically contribute to apoptotic execution through its catabolic role. TEM is recommended to detect autophagosomes and autolysosomes. RNAi-mediated gene silencing is now well established in ticks. it is currently being developed to analyze the function of autophagy-related genes in ticks during nonfeeding periods and in response to pathogen infection. zebrafish are a promising organism for the study of autophagy's role in disease including Huntington disease,1201 Alzheimer disease,1440 and myofibrillar myopathy. many chemicals can be added to the media and are absorbed directly through the skin. C. elegans has a single ortholog of most yeast Atg proteins. however, 2 nematode homologs exist for Atg4, Atg8 and Atg16.1260-1262. the LGG-1/Atg8/LC3 reporter is the most commonly used tool to detect autophagy in C. elegans. the exact function of LGG-1 versus LGG-2 remains to be addressed. it is best to use integrated versions of the marker741,742,1267 (GFP::LGG-1 and GFP::LGG-2; Fig. 27) the arrows show representative GFP::LGG-1-positive punctate areas that label pre-autophagosomal and autophagosomal structures. the relative levels of PE-conjugated and unconjugated GFP::LGG-1 were determined by western blotting. the LGG-1 precursor accumulates in the atg-4.1 mutant, but is undetectable in wild-type embryos. the banding pattern of LGG-1 or LGG-1 fused to fluorescent proteins may not be easy to interpret in larvae or the adult C. elegans. impaired autophagy activity results in their accumulation and the generation of numerous aggregates. degradation of these autophagy substrates can also be used to monitor autophagy activity, with similar cautionary notes to those described in section A3. chicken B-lymphoid DT40 cell line is a suitable tool for the analysis of autophagic processes in a nonmammalian vertebrate system. in DT40 cells, foreign DNA integrates with a very high frequency by homologous recombination compared to random integration. this makes the cell line a valuable tool for the generation of cellular gene knockouts. TEM, LC3 western blotting and fluorescence microscopy. flux measurements include monitoring LC3-II turnover and tandem mRFP/mCherry-GFP-LC3 fluorescence microscopy. chick retina can be used for monitoring autophagy at different stages of development. commercially available antibodies for mammalian LC3 and GABARAP have been reported to detect the chicken counterparts in western blots. in the may 2006 chicken assembly, 5% of the sequence has not been anchored to specific chromosomes. it is possible that there is some divergence within the signaling pathways between mammalian and nonmammalian models. localization of Atg8 by immunofluorescence microscopy can also be used to study autophagy in Chlamydomonas. atg8 signal is weak and usually detected as a single spot in nonstressed cells, whereas autophagy activation results in the localization of Atg8 in multiple spots. a commercial rabbit monoclonal anti-GABARAP antibody can be used to detect endogenous levels of Drosophila Atg8a in both immunostaining and immunoblotting experiments. 510,623,1286 Cultured Drosophila (S2) cells can be stably transfected with GFP fused to Drosophila Atg8a. stable S2 cells with GFP-Atg8a under control of a 2-kb Atg8a 5 overexpression of GFP-mCherry-Atg8 results in significant increase in Atg8\u2013PE by western blot. this occurs even in control flies in which punctate GFP-Atg8 is not detected by immunofluorescence (M. Fanto, unpublished results), and in transfected Drosophila Kc167 cells, uninducible but persistent GFP-Atg8 puncta are detected. the unique morphology of red blood cells (RBCs) is instrumental to their function. they have a bi-concave shape provided by a highly flexible membrane and a cytoplasm deficient in organelles. this architecture allows unimpeded circulation of the RBC even through the thinnest blood vessels, thereby delivering O2 to all the tissues of the body. expression of genes required for autophagosome assembly/function, such as LC3B, does not appear to be regulated by nutrient deprivation, but rather is upregulated by the erythroid-specific transcription factor GATA1.641 FOXO3. also, lipidation of the cytosolic form of LC3B into the lipidated LC3-II form is controlled by EPO (erythropoietin), the erythroid-specific growth cell types, in erythroid cells TP53 activation may influence the functional consequences of autophagy. diseases associated with congenic or acquired loss-of-function mutations are characterized by activated TP53 and abnormally high levels of autophagic death of erythroid cells and anemia. autophagy appears to be necessary for the development of aerial hyphae,276,1302,1307,1312 and for appresorium function in M. oryzae, Colletotrichum orbiculare and Metarhizium robertsii. some of these effects could be caused by the absence of autophagic processing of storage lipids (lipophagy) to generate glycerol for increasing turgor and recycling the contents of spores autophagy has been investigated intensively in Aspergilli and in particular in the genetically amenable species Aspergillus nidulans. autophagy has been monitored by the more \u201ccanonical\u201d GFP-Atg8 proteolysis assays, by monitoring the delivery of GFP-Atg8 to the vacuole. autophagosomes normally fuse with the vacuole in a Rab7-dependent manner. this finding agrees with previous work in S. cerevisiae demonstrating that Ypt1 is activated by the Trs85-containing version of TRAPP, TRAPPIII, for autophagy. the suitability of A. nidulans for in vivo microscopy has been exploited to demonstrate that nascent phagophores are cradled by ER-associated structures resembling mammalian omegasomes. autophagy is a target for some widespread food preservatives used to prevent yeast-dependent spoilage. a number of genome-wide studies have identified vacuolar functions and autophagy as relevant processes during primary wine fermentation. honeybees, or insects whose ovaries exhibit a meroistic polytrophic developmental cycle, can be a useful tool to analyze and monitor physiological autophagy. the primary method currently being used to monitor autophagy is following the formation of autophagosomes and autolysosomes by TEM. rapamycin, lysosomal inhibitors chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, and microtubule depolymerizing agent colchicine are all available as clinically approved drugs. however, these drugs have serious side effects, which often impede their clinical use to study autophagy. study of autophagy in the blood has revealed SNCA may represent a further marker to evaluate the autophagy level in T lymphocytes isolated from peripheral blood. SNCA can be detected by western blot as a useful tool for the evaluation of macroautophagy in primary T lymphocytes. postmortem autolysis and fixation artifacts must always be taken into consideration when interpreting changes attributed to autophagy. despite significant postmortem intervals, sections of a few millimeters thickness cut from fresh autopsy brain can yield TEM images of sufficient ultrastructural morphology to discriminate different autophagic vacuole subtypes. an analysis that examined liver and skeletal muscle from critically ill patients used tissue biopsies that were taken within 30 20 min after death and were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen followed by storage at -80\u00b0C. 1061 Samples could subsequently be used for EM and western blot analysis. autophagy substrates can provide information on the overall efficacy of the pathway. accumulation of substrates, such as LC3-II protein levels, can provide information on the overall efficacy of the pathway. however, none of these measurements on its own provides enough information on (the efficacy of) autophagy. LC3-II colocalizes with lipid droplets, indicating a role for autophagy in the mobilization of free fatty acids. little is known regarding the changes of lipophagy under pathological conditions, such as drug toxicity, alcoholic steatohepatitis or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. autophagy can be induced by RNAi-mediated knockdown of Kazal1,1354,1355 or with rapamycin treatment. autophagy can be induced by RNAi-mediated knockdown of Kazal1,1354,1355 or with rapamycin treatment. evidence obtained in swine suggests that upregulation of autophagy may protect the heart against damage caused by acute myocardial infarction/heart attack. studies in rabbits suggest a protective role of upregulated autophagy against critical illness-induced multiple organ failure and muscle weakness. encoding bovine LC3 into the pEGFP-C1 vector makes it possible to observe induction of autophagy in bovine MECs in a more specific manner than can be achieved by immunofluorescence techniques. in contrast to cell culture experiments, precise monitoring of autophagic flux is practically impossible in vivo in large animals. repetitive analyses of small tissue biopsies could be assumed to induce artifacts following repetitive tissue destruction. these autophagic substrates can include SQSTM1 and (poly)ubiquitinated substrates or aggregates, but also specific substrates such as damaged mitochondria. despite their static nature, such measurement could provide a clue about the results of altered autophagic flux in vivo. the right approach to studying autophagy in large animals likely differs depending on the question that is being addressed. the use of an appropriate control group with a sufficient number of animals per time point is crucial in this regard. the use of custom antibodies makes it possible to monitor Atg8 conversion to Atg8\u2013PE by western blotting. transfection of GFP-Atg8 or mCherry-GFP-Atg8 has been reported in lepidoptera. western blotting did not reveal the conversion of Atg8 into Atg8\u2013PE. however, a single band with an approximate molecular mass of 42 kDa was observed that was independent of the percentage of cells displaying punctate Atg8. the utility of monitoring Atg8 in insects may depend on the particular organism and antibody. macroautophagy in the digestive gland of Ruditapes decussatus subjected to a strict starvation of 2 months. this characteristic is accompanied by massive macroautophagy in the digestive gland. this phenomenon, observed by TEM, demonstrates once again the advantage of using this classical ultrastructural method to study autophagy in unconventional biological models. odontoblasts are long-lived postmitotic cells, which evolved from neural crest cells early during vertebrate evolution. odontoblasts develop a well-characterized autophagy-lysosomal system, including a conspicuous autophagic vacuole that ensures turnover and degradation of cell components. TEM cannot distinguish between activation and blockage of autophagy, which would be observed as an accumulation of autophagosomes. several commercial antibodies against human LC3 have been tried without success, and 3 planarian-specific antibodies have been generated. fusion of cytochrome b5 and the original (tetrameric) RFP generate an aggregated cargo protein that displays cytosolic puncta of red fluorescence and diffuse staining throughout the vacuolar lumen. in plant studies, GFP-Atg8 fluorescence is typically assumed to correspond to autophagosomes; however, caution needs to be exercised because it cannot be ruled out that Atg8 is involved in processes other than autophagy. the ubiquitin promoter line may be useful when studying an inhibitory effect of a drug/mutation on autophagic delivery. the 35S promoter line may be used for testing potential autophagy inducers. a tandem fluorescence reporter system is also available in arabidopsis. autophagosome in tobacco cells cultured for 24 h without a nitrogen source. it has been assumed that autophagic bodies are found in the vacuoles of plant cells. both microautophagy and macroautophagy are detected in plant cells. only a few of the known ATG genes are present in these organisms, which raises the question about the minimal system necessary for the normal functioning of autophagy. protist models have the potential to open a completely new area in autophagy research. D. discoideum is a versatile model to study infection with human pathogens and the role of autophagy in the infection process. the susceptibility of D. discoideum to microbial infection and its strategies to counteract pathogens are similar to those in higher eukaryotes. lysosomal protease inhibitors E64 and pepstatin block lysosomal degradative activity in Plasmodium. lysosomal protease inhibitors E64 and pepstatin block lysosomal degradative activity in Plasmodium. however, these inhibitors do not affect ATG8 levels and associated structures. the scuticociliate Philasterides dicentrarchi is a free-living ciliated protist. the ciliates maintain spatially differentiated germline and somatic nuclear genomes within a single cell. they maintain spatially differentiated germline and somatic nuclear genomes within a single cell. lysosomes fuse only to the old parental macronucleus. other co-existing nuclei such as developing new macro- and micronuclei are unaffected. lysosomes fuse only to the old parental macronucleus. lysosomes fuse only to the old parental macronucleus. the genomic resources in rainbow trout are now being extensively developed. a high-throughput DNA sequencing program of EST has been initiated associated with numerous transcriptomics studies. most components of the autophagy and associated signaling pathways are evolutionarily conserved in rainbow trout. studies on whole embryos make it possible to obtain qualitative and quantitative data for autophagy. it is very easy to study the effects of inducers or inhibitors of autophagy by adding these substances directly into the culture. inhibition of autophagy by 3-MA results in a concurrent reduction of apoptosis. TEM is recommended to detect autophagosomes and autolysosomes. it is difficult to distinguish between autophagy (autolysosomes) and blood digestion (lysosomes) with acidotropic dyes. zebrafish Zebrafish (Danio rerio) have many characteristics that make them a valuable model organism for the analysis of autophagy. morpholino treatment has successfully knocked down the core autophagy machinery protein Gabarap,1437. zebrafish are ideal organisms for in vivo drug discovery and/or verification because of their relatively small size and aqueous habitat. many chemicals can be added to the media and are absorbed directly through the skin. EM analysis reveals that LAP involves single-membrane structures. macroautophagy is expected to generate double-membrane structures surrounding cargo. RB1CC1, ATG13, and ULK1 dispensable for LAP. LC3-associated apicoplast In the Apicomplexa parasitic protists (e.g., T. gondii and Plasmodium spp.), the single ATG8 homolog localizes to an endosymbiotic nonphotosynthetic plastid, called the apicoplast.1408,1451-1454 This organelle is approximately 300 nm in diameter, and is composed of 4 membranes that trace their ancestry to cell-autonomous immune system uses IFNG-induced effectors to attack and disrupt this type of membrane structure. effective targeting of these effectors onto the PVM of T. gondii requires the autophagic ubiquitin-like conjugation system. however, up- or downregulation of canonical autophagy using rapamycin, wortmannin, or starvation do not significantly affect the IFNG-mediated control. LC3-conjugation system may target GBPs to the PVM of T. gondii. it may play crucial roles in the general guidance of various effector molecules to target membranes as well as in selective autophagosome-dependent sequestration. 179,180,1449 LAP represents a unique process that marries ancient pathways of phagocytosis and autophagy. LC3-decorated autophagosomes can take hours to form, whereas macroautophagy is expected to generate double-membrane structures. an oxidase-dependent cell death process has been reported that can be activated by the small molecule NID-1. this process depends on PtdIns3K signaling, generates LC3B puncta and single-membrane vacuoles, and results in the clearance of SQSTM1. apicoplast is the product of a secondary endosymbiotic event. LC3 conjugation system for IFNG-mediated pathogen control Similar to LAP, LC3 localizes on the parasitophorus vacuole membrane (PVM) of T. gondii. cell-autonomous immune system uses IFNG-induced effectors to attack and disrupt this type of membrane structure. the LC3-conjugation system-dependent targeting happens even in nonphagocytic cells. the system may play crucial roles in the general guidance of various effector molecules to target membranes as well as in selective autophagosome-dependent sequestration. the increasing availability of complete (or near complete) genomes for key species spanning the eukaryotic domain provides a unique opportunity for delineating the spread of autophagic machinery components in the eukaryotic world. a number of computational tools and resources related to autophagy have become available online. this low sequence identity is especially pronounced in proteins that contain large intrinsically disordered regions. sophisticated (manual) database search protocols may assist in eliminating spurious similarities or in the identification of homologs that share low sequence identity with the search molecule. the human autophagy database (HADb) lists over 200 human genes/proteins related to autophagy. the database is publicly available online at the URL http://autophagy.lu/. the autophagy database is publicly available online at the URL http://www.tanpaku.org/autophagy/index.html.
