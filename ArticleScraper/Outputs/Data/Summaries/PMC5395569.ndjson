{"summary": "the evergreen coniferous shrub, Juniperus rigida, is endemic to East Asia. its branches and leaves have been widely used in traditional Mongolian medicine in china and as an important raw material to provide essential oil for the chemical industry. lignans and flavonoids from J. rigida exert strong biological effects. chroomatographic fingerprint analysis is widely accepted technique due to its high confidence in quality assessment of agricultural products. fingerprint analysis has not been applied to evaluate the quality of J. rigida to date.

DPPH radical scavenging capacity was measured using the method described by Yen and Chen (1995) the diameters of the inhibition zone (DIZ) were ranked as follows: not sensitive () for zone diameters equal to 8 mm or below, sensitive (+) for zone diameters between 8 and 14 mm, very sensitive (++) for zone diameters between 14 and 20 mm (Schroeder and Messing, 1949; Ponce et al., 2003). the HPLC fingerprint assay was adopted to establish a standard for quality evaluation of J. rigida. all relative standard deviation (RSD) of the relative peak areas were 3%, suggesting that the conditions for fingerprint analysis were optimal. plants Needles of J. rigida were collected from 11 regions covering all primary origins in China. all materials were air-dried, powdered, and stored in the dark at 20\u00b0C. a, JL JHX E126\u00b031\u2032N41\u00b041\u2032 660 5 1 S10 Changbai Mountain, National nature reserve, JL CBS E128\u00b006\u2032N42\u00b010\u2032 1146 5 2 S11 Dandong, Fengcheng, LN LYM E124\u00b012\u2032N40\u00b017\u2032 228 5 2 Figure 1.
