{"summary": "Bordetella bronchiseptica is a Gram-negative bacterium closely related to Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella parapertussis. it is a primary cause of bronchopneumonia, and in older pigs, it contributes to secondary pneumonia (1\u20133) it promotes colonization by toxigenic strains of Pasteurella multocida, which leads to severe progressive atrophic rhinitis (4, 5). biofilms are defined as an adherent community of microorganisms encased within a complex matrix that protects the encased community from environmental stresses. recent studies have demonstrated that both B. pertussis and B. bronchiseptica are capable of forming biofilms on abiotic surfaces (36\u201341) the laboratory reference strain of B. bronchiseptica, RB50, was originally isolated from a rabbit and has previously been demonstrated to form biofilms. to experimentally address this hypothesis, we examined several B. bronchiseptica strains isolated from a variety of animal species and investigated the ability of these strains to form biofilms. the indicated strains were grown statically for 72 h. bars represent the average of absorbances obtained from 3 independent plates. KM22 bpsABCD locus is highly conserved and similar to RB50 bpsABCD. two nucleotide insertions were identified within the intergenic region between KM22_01872 and bpsR. genes constituting the bpsABCD operon (orange arrows) are labeled, the regulatory gene bpsR (red arrow) is labeled, and genes not associated with the bps locus (blue arrows) are labeled. KM22bps exhibited a severe loss in the production of the antibody cross-reactive material. the nucleotide regions containing the bpsABCD loci for KM22 and RB50 are highly conserved and over 99% identical. the bpsABCD locus is required for the production of PNAG by KM22. KM22bps biofilms exhibited statistically greater biovolume (P = 0.0145) and biomass (P = 0.0145) than did KM22 biofilms. KM22bps biofilms exhibited statistically greater biovolume (P = 0.0145) and biomass (P = 0.0145) than did KM22 biofilms. group of 1-week-old piglets were intranasally inoculated with KM22, KM22bps, or phosphate-buffered saline. no significant difference in the number of CFU recovered from the nasal cavity of KM22bps-infected pigs was found for any of the time points examined. groups of 16 pigs were inoculated intranasally with KM22 (circles) or KM22bps (triangles) Bacterial load in the trachea (B) was quantified 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, and 56 days postinoculation. clinical signs were noted only in piglets from groups inoculated with KM22 or the KM22bps mutant. the bpsABCD locus enhances survival in the lung or lower respiratory tract of swine. it is not required for persistence in the upper respiratory tract or disease severity. it has been demonstrated that PNAG is expressed during infections. serum levels of anti-Bordetella IgG were quantified in pigs infected with KM22 or KM22bps. heat-killed KM22 whole cells were used as antigen. higher serum anti-Bordetella IgG levels were detected in KM22 and KM22bps-infected pigs than in PBS-inoculated pigs. the bpsABCD locus does not mediate protection from complement-mediated killing. sera from KM22-, KM22bps-, or mock-infected pigs induced similar levels of antibody-complement killing of wild-type KM22 and KM22bps mutant. biofilm development is a conserved phenotype among B. bronchiseptica strains isolated from multiple animal species. the laboratory reference strain of B. bronchiseptica, RB50, was originally isolated from a rabbit. biofilm formation was quantified by standard microtiter assays. bars represent the average of absorbances obtained from 3 independent plates representing biological replicates, each containing triplicate replicates. KM22 bpsABCD locus is highly conserved and similar to RB50 bpsABCD. bpsA was observed to be 99.95% with 1 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), bpsB was 99.668% identical with 7 SNPs, bpsD was 99.762% identical with 3 SNPs, bpsD was 100% identical, and bpsR was 98.971% identical with 5 SNPs. these SNPs are predicted to result in following amino acid replacements. cell surface extracts were obtained for B. bronchiseptica strains RB50, KM22, and KM22bps. both RB50 and KM22bps produced a polysaccharide antigenically similar to that of S. aureus PNAG. KM22bps exhibited a severe loss in the production of the antibody cross-reactive material. biofilms formed by KM22 or KM22bps were quantitatively analyzed. KM22 biofilms exhibited statistically greater maximum thickness (P = 0.0219) and a statistically greater roughness coefficient (P = 0.0145) than did KM22bps biofilms. a larger amount of dead cells were observed in the KM22bps biofilms. the KM22 bpsABCD locus enhances survival in the lower respiratory tract of swine. piglets were intranasally inoculated with KM22, KM22bps or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) no significant difference in the number of CFU recovered from the tracheas of KM22bps-infected pigs was found for any of the time points examined. overall, significantly lower CFU levels were recovered from the swine respiratory tract than from those infected with the wild-type KM22 for all days examined. pneumonia exhibited was mild, typical of B. bronchiseptica pneumonia. pneumonia consisted of areas of red, observed 7 and 14 days postinfection, to tan, seen 42 and 56 days postinfection, consolidation with well-demarcated borders and a cranial ventral distribution. both B. bronchiseptica and B. pertussis have been shown to express Bps in the nasal cavities of mice during infections. we therefore tested if the bpsABCD locus contributed to differences in serum anti-Bordetella antibody titers. serum levels of anti-Bordetella IgG were quantified in pigs. serum was collected 56 days postchallenge from pigs intranasally inoculated with KM22 of KM22bps or mock challenged with PBS. the bpsABCD locus did not affect the development of anti-Bordetella humoral immunity in swine. pigs induced similar levels of antibody-complement killing of wild-type KM22 and the KM22bps mutant. the bpsABCD locus does not mediate protection from complement-mediated killing of B. bronchiseptica KM22. a one-way ANOVA with Tukey's posttest was used for statistical analysis. assays were used to quantify biofilm formation produced by a variety of B. bronchiseptica isolates. several isolates exhibited a greater capacity to form biofilms than the reference strain. the ability to form a biofilm is a beneficial and conserved phenotype among B. bronchiseptica isolates. biofilms formed by wild-type KM22 contained significantly less dead bacterial cells than KM22bps biofilms. to investigate the contribution of the bpsABCD locus to the pathogenesis of B. bronchiseptica in swine, we compared the KM22bps mutant to the wild-type swine isolate. microbial communities present in upper respiratory tract of swine differ from those present in mice and often include bacterial species such as Actinobacillus, Haemophilus, Pasteurella, Mycoplasma, Streptococcus, and Staphylococcus (50\u201352), all of which are known to form biofilms. field isolates of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae are known to produce a polysaccharide similar to S the KM22bps mutant was recovered from the lungs at significantly lower levels than the wild type for all days examined. the decreased bacterial burden of the KM22bps mutant is different from that reported for the corresponding RB50bps mutant in mice. the decreased bacterial burden of the KM22bps mutant also differs from lung colonization reported for a B. pertussis bps mutant in mice. ectopic expression of bpsABCD genes in Escherichia coli provided resistance to complement-mediated killing and complement deposition (48). the same study went on to demonstrate that ectopic expression of bpsABCD genes in Escherichia coli provided resistance to complement-mediated killing and complement-mediated killing. strain-specific differences in Bordetella respiratory tract colonization from different animal species. findings highlight the importance of studying bacterial strains isolated from different animal species. PNAG is a conserved surface/capsular polysaccharide expressed by a large number of bacterial, fungal, and eukaryotic pathogens. 99 was isolated from a seal, strain OSU054 was isolated from a turkey. strain SO3287 was isolated from a sea otter. all B. bronchiseptica strains were maintained on Bordet-Gengou. 100 l of SS medium at 37\u00b0C in 96-well polyvinyl chloride (PVC) microtiter plates were sealed with cellophane tape. the microtiter plates were exchanged with fresh SS broth every 24 h. at 72 h, the nonattached and loosely adherent bacteria were removed by discarding the medium from the wells. the insert of pTN33, containing the downstream region of bpsA, was cloned into pUC19 via EcoRI and XbaI sites to obtain pTN40. the 1,554 bp upstream and the first 20 codons of the bpsA gene were PCR amplified using primers bpsA-for and bpsA-rev. the resulting PCR product was purified, ligated into the pCR-Blun the absence of pTN49 was confirmed by growth on BG-streptomycin plates and lack of growth on BG-carbenicillin plates. colonies were screened by PCR using screening primers bpsADck-for and bpsADck-rev (Table 3) to detect either the wild-type locus (8,820 bp) or the bpsABCD deletion (2,914 bp) 5 109 cells of different strains grown overnight at 37\u00b0C in broth culture were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 100 l of 0.5 M EDTA, and boiled for 5 min at 100\u00b0C. the supernatant was treated with 1 mg proteinase K/ml for 60 min at 60\u00b0C. a 5-l volume of the extract was spotted on a nitrocellulose membrane and allowed to dry overnight. the flow of SS/Sm medium was initiated at a rate of 0.3 ml/min. mature biofilms were stained with 1 l/ml Syto 9 and 1 l/ml propidium iodide. image acquisition software used was Nikon NIS-Elements AR 4.40. dilutions of inocula of strains KM22 and TN29 (bps mutant) showed expected colony morphology and hemolytic characteristics. each experimental group of pigs was housed in a separate isolation room in biosafety level 2 containment facilities. trachea washes were performed by instilling 5 ml of PBS into the nasal cavity through one nostril and collecting the effluent into a beaker. dilutions were made from nasal swab, nasal and tracheal wash, and lung lavage fluids. limit of detection was 10 CFU/ml. comparisons were made between challenge groups for each isolate at each time point using a 5% level of significance (P 0.05) to assess statistical differences. a 5% level of significance (P 0.05) was used to assess statistical differences. secondary antibodies specific for swine immunoglobulin G were analyzed for significance using ANOVA with Tukey's multiple-comparison test. A 5% level of significance (P 0.05) was considered significant. KM22 is a virulent swine isolate (61, 62), and strain KM22bps is a bpsABCD in-frame deletion mutant of KM22. all B. bronchiseptica strains were maintained on Bordet-Gengou. us tags for the genes studied are as follows: bpsA, KM22_01871; bpsB, KM22_01870; bpsD, KM22_01868; and bpsR, KM22_01874. the 1,175 bp downstream and the last 6 codons of the bpsABCD gene were PCR amplified using bpsD-for and bpsD-rev. the insert of pTN33, containing the downstream region of bpsD, was cloned into pUC19 via XbaI and HindIII sites to obtain pTN44. pTN49 was introduced into E. coli SM10pir and transconjugated into KM22. cointegrants were positively selected on BG-streptomycin-carbenicillin plates. resulting cointegrants were streaked onto BG plates without added MgSO4. colonies were screened by PCR using screening primers bpsADck-for and bpsADck-rev. extracts were prepared using a previously described method for purification of PNAG in Staphylococcus species. a 5-l volume of the extract was spotted on a nitrocellulose membrane and allowed to dry overnight. the membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat milk and probed with a goat antibody. overnight cultures of B. bronchiseptica KM22 and KM22bps were grown in SS medium with 40 g/ml streptomycin (SS/Sm) the overnight cultures were diluted to an OD of approximately 0.250 in fresh SS/Sm. flow cells were incubated for 90 min at room temperature to allow initial bacterial adherence. strains KM22 and KM22bps were cultured on BG agar for 40 h. dilutions of inoculum for each strain were plated on BG agar plates. dilutions of inoculum for each strain contained 5.6 105 and 4.3 105 CFU/ml. on days 7, 14, 28, and 56 postinoculation, 4 pigs from each experimental group (KM22 or KM22bps) and 2 pigs from the mock-infected group were euthanized for sample collection. the trachea was severed just below the larynx, and the trachea and lung were removed. asal cavity, trachea, and lung were randomly screened by PCR. PCR was performed to confirm that recovered colonies were the same as the challenge strain for all B. bronchiseptica-inoculated groups. serum was collected from infected and control pigs on day 56 postchallenge. a 5% level of significance (P 0.05) was considered significant. serial dilutions in PBS were then plated on blood agar plates to determine CFU counts. a 5% level of significance (P 0.05) was considered significant."}
