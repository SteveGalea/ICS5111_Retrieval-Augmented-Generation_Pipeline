{"summary": "the prevalence of mannose-binding lectin deficiency ranged from 0.5% to 52.2%, depending on how deficiency was defined. a large sample of subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease selected for having an increased risk of experiencing an acute exacerbation. low MBL concentrations occur as a result of one of three single nucleotide polymorphisms on exon 1. most common cause of deficiency in Caucasians is the LXP haplotype. studies assessing association of low MBL concentrations with acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPDs) report conflicting results. subjects with COPD who had an increased risk of experiencing acute exacerbations would have more frequent acute exacerbations during one year of follow-up if they were deficient in MBL than if they were not. samples were diluted 1/500 for this assay and assayed in duplicate wells. the range of the standard curve corresponds to concentrations ranging from 78 ng/mL to 5000 ng/mL. a sample was still less than the detection limit at 1/20 dilution. randomized to receive azithromycin or placebo were analyzed separately and together. Statistical analysis A Cox proportional-hazards model analysis was used with time-to-first-exacerbation as the outcome variable and MBL group as the primary variable of interest. samples were diluted 1/500 for this assay and assayed in duplicate wells. the range corresponds to concentrations ranging from 78 ng/mL to 5000 ng/mL. a sample was still less than the detection limit at 1/20 dilution. MBL concentrations from patients randomized to receive azithromycin or placebo were analyzed both separately and together. Statistical analysis A Cox proportional-hazards model analysis was used with time-to-first-exacerbation as the outcome variable and MBL group as the primary variable of interest. a greater fraction of women had MBL deficiency defined as >50 ng/mL and 1000 ng/mL than was seen with the other definitions. there was no suggestion that airflow limitation was worse or that GOLD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease) stage was higher in subjects with MBL deficiency. black, n (% total black) 136 (100) 2 (1.5) 134 (98.5) 7 (5.1) 129 (94.9) 49 (36.0) 87 (64.0) 80 (58.8) 54 (39.7) Hispanic, n (% total Hispanic) 25 (100) 0 (0.0) 25 (100) 1 (4.0) 24 (96.0) 7 (28.0) 18 (72.0) 14 (56.0) 11 (44.0) Age, years (SD) 65.4 (8.6) 6 n (% of total stage 4) 339 (100) 2 (0.6) 337 (99.4) 5 (1.5) 334 (98.5) 78 (23.0) 261 (77.0) 165 (48.7) 172 (50.7) Current smoker, n (%) 220 (21.2) 1 (0.5) 219 (99.5) 2 (0.9) 218 (99.1) 49 (22.3) 171 (77.7) 105 (47.7) 114 (51.8) Former smoker, n a negative-binomial analysis of a model that included treatment group and log-transformed MBL concentration stratified by clinic found that treatment group was significant (P 0.0001) but log-transformed MBL concentration was not (P = 0.470) no association between the time to first AECOPD and the rate of AECOPD per patient-year was observed in the population as a whole. at least three AECOPDs during the course of the study in the population as a whole, or in either treatment group.

MBL concentrations were not presented in a fashion that allowed determination of the prevalence of MBL deficiency by literature-based definitions. forty-two patients had no AECOPDs and only six (14%) had MBL-deficient genotypes. patients with MBL-deficient genotypes also had a higher mortality. however, in a cross-sectional study, Eagan et al31 found that 18.2% and 42.9% of healthy subjects had MBL concentrations 100 ng/mL and 500 ng/mL respectively. we did not confirm that low MBL concentrations were the result of variant alleles. 30% and 4%\u20138% of the normal population have heterozygous or homozygous genetic mutations associated with low MBL concentrations. two studies documenting the association between MBL deficiency and AECOPDs found an association with AECOPDs that were not otherwise defined by cause or potential infecting organism. we found no difference in the distribution of pathogens in those subjects with AECOPD and without MBL-deficient genotypes. we cannot exclude the possibility that very low concentrations of MBL have an association with AECOPDs."}
