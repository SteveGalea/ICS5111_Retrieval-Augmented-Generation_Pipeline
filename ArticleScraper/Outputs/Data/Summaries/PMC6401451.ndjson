{"summary": "highly pathogenic human coronaviruses cause severe infection of the lower respiratory tract in humans. these zoonotic pathogens have mortality rates of >50% in aged and immunosuppressed populations, making them potentially important emerging pathogens (10, 11) broad-spectrum antiviral drugs against these coronaviruses (and other highly pathogenic viruses) will facilitate rapid responses to pandemic threats. mice were moribund due to severe pulmonary edema caused by skewing the immune response toward a Th2 profile after infection by mouse-adapted SARS-CoV. TMPRSS2-KO mice showed no body weight loss and weak proinflammatory responses after SARS-CoV infection. we infected wild-type (WT), TMPRSS2-KO (KO), hDPP4-Tg (Tg), and TMPRSS2-KO hDPP4 (KO-Tg) mice with 105 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID50) of F-musX. these symptoms were not observed in TMPRSS2-KO mice. C57BL/6 (WT) and TMPRSS2-KO mice were inoculated with F-musX (SARS-CoV) mice were inoculated with TMPRSS2-KO, n = 14 (male, 11; female, 3); WT, n = 10 (male, 5; female, 5); mice 22 to 28 weeks old were used. Error bars represent standard errors. the graph was calculated by the Mann-Whitney test. number of animals per group was as follows: TMPRSS2-KO, n = 3 per time point. some antigen-positive cells were seen in alveoli from both WT and TMPRSS2-KO mice on day 3 p.i. on day 3 p.i., cell debris and diffuse inflammatory infiltration were observed around bronchi and in the alveoli of TMPRSS2-KO mice. similar responses were observed in the lungs of TMPRSS2-KO mice. the concentrations of inflammatory growth factors, chemokines, and cytokines were significantly lower than those in WT mice. TMPRSS2-KO, n = 4 per time point (male, 0 to 1; female, 3 to 4); WT, n = 4 per time point (male, 0 to 1; female, 3 to 4). TMPRSS2-KO mice show weaker proinflammatory responses and less severe lung pathology after infection with MERS-CoV. TMPRSS2-KO Tg mice were generated as described in Materials and Methods. we confirmed the presence of the transgene of hDPP4 and absence of the TMPRSS2 gene by PCR analysis using two primer sets specific for hDPP4 and TMPRSS2. the mice were then used to examine the role of TMPRSS2 after MERS-CoV infection. numbers of animals per group were as follows: TMPRSS2-KO Tg, n = 8 (male, 2; female, 6); hDPP4-Tg, n = 6 (male, 3; female, 3); hDPP4-Tg, n = 6 (male, 3; female, 3). Error bars represent standard errors. TMPRSS2-KO Tg, n = 3 per time point (male, 1 to 2; female, 1 to 2); WT, n = 3 per time point (male, 2 to 3; female, 0 to 1). Representative images from mice were taken on days 1, 3, and 7 p.i. on day 1 p.i., many viral antigen-positive cells were observed in the bronchi and alveolar areas of hDPP4-Tg mice. there were none in the bronchi and only a few in the alveoli of TMPRSS2-KO Tg mice. on day 7 p.i., thickening of the alveolar wall was observed in TMPRSS2-KO Tg mice. a lymphocyte aggregate (*) and cellular infiltrations persisted in the alveolar area of the hDPP4-Tg mouse. TMPRSS2-KO Tg mice showed similar responses, but they occurred later or were lesspronounced than in hDPP4-Tg mice on. expression levels of IL-6 and other inflammatory chemokines were higher in TMPRSS2-KO Tg mice than in hDPP4-Tg mice on day 7 p.i. hDPP4-Tg (Tg) and TMPRSS2-KO hDPP4-Tg (TMPRSS2-KO Tg) mice were inoculated with EMC-HCoV. no obvious increase in TLR3 expression in the lungs of mice was observed. however, IFN-4 and IFN- mRNA expression levels were higher in hDPP4-Tg mice than in TMPRSS2-KO Tg mice on days 2 and/or 3 p.i. kines and chemokines in the lungs at 24 h postinfection are shown. the assays were done using unicate samples per animal. TMPRSS2-KO mice show no body weight loss and weak proinflammatory responses after SARS-CoV infection. PCR analysis was performed on the genomic DNA from ear punches taken from WT (WT, 4 to 5 weeks old; n = 3 male mice), TMPRSS2-KO (4 to 5 weeks old; n = 3 male mice), hDPP4-Tg (4 to 5 weeks old; n = 3 [male, 1; female, 2]) and TMPRSS2-KO Tg (4 to 5 weeks old; n = 3 [male, 1; female, 2] mice) number of animals per group were as follows: TMPRSS2-KO, n = 4 to 5 mice per time point (male, 0 to 1; female, 3 to 4); WT, n = 4 to 5 per time point (male, 0 to 1; female, 3 to 4); female, 3 to 4. dotted line indicates the limit of detection. immunohistochemical analysis was performed using an anti-SARS-CoV polyclonal antibody (at 1 and 3 days p.i.) several alveolar cells around the bronchi are positive for viral antigen (middle panels, brown) on day 3 p.i., several alveolar cells around the bronchi in both WT and TMPRSS2-KO mice are positive for viral antigen (middle panels, brown) formation of granulation tissue was observed in the healing alveolar area of most TMPRSS2-KO mice (8 of 9 mice) on day 10 p.i., formation of granulation tissue was observed in the healing alveolar area of most WT mice (8 of 9 mice) on day 10 p.i., it was observed in only a few TMPRSS2-KO mice (3 of 14 mice) similar responses were observed in the lungs of TMPRSS2-KO mice. however, the concentrations of KC/CXCL1, IL-12 (p40/p70), IL-4, and IL-10 were significantly lower than those in WT mice at day 2 or 3 p.i. TMPRSS2-KO hDPP4-Tg mice show weaker proinflammatory responses and less severe lung pathology after infection by SARS-CoV. TMPRSS2-KO Tg mice showed weaker proinflammatory responses and less severe lung pathology after infection with MERS-CoV. a temporary and mild loss of body weight was observed in TMPRSS2-KO Tg mice. the results of virus titer measurements suggested that the virus replicated more slowly in the lungs of TMPRSS2-KO Tg mice. the lung from one out of five Tg mice contained 106.45 TCID50/g at day 7 p.i. s of animals per group were as follows: TMPRSS2-KO Tg, n = 4 per time point (male, 0 to 1; female, 3 to 4); hDPP4-Tg, n = 4 per time point (male, 1 to 2; female, 2 to 3); hDPP4-Tg, n = 4 per time point (male, 1 to 2; female, 2 to 3). Error bars represent standard errors. several viral antigen-positive cells are seen in the bronchi and alveoli of a hDPP4-Tg mouse on day 3 p.i. fewer are present in a TMPRSS2-KO Tg mouse (middle panels, brown) on day 7, massive cellar proliferation is observed in the alveoli of a hDPP4-Tg mouse. lymphocyte aggregates and cellular infiltrations were seen in the healing alveolar area of hDPP4-Tg mice. on day 7 p.i., lymphocyte aggregates and cellular infiltrations were seen in the healing alveolar area of TMPRSS2-KO Tg mice. but no granulation tissues were detected in either mouse. TMPRSS2-KO Tg mice showed similar responses, but they occurred later or were less pronounced than in hDPP4-Tg mice on day 7 p.i. expression levels of IL-6 and other inflammatory chemokines were higher in TMPRSS2-KO Tg mice than in hDPP4-Tg mice on day 7 p.i. the levels of type I IFN and TLR3 mRNA expression in the lungs at 6 h and at 1, 2, and 3 days p.i. were measured by real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), 24, 26. we inoculated mice intranasally with poly(IC) to assess the effect of knocking out TMPRSS2 on innate immune responses in the absence of virus infection. TMPRSS2-KO mice intrinsically exhibit weaker or delayed inflammatory chemokine and cytokine responses via toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) hDPP4-Tg mice are susceptible to infection by a MERS-CoV isolate. TMPRSS2 plays an important role in the early phase of disease (lung infection); in particular, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV replicated in the bronchioles. TMPRSS2-KO mice show weaker, or delayed, inflammatory chemokine and cytokine responses mediated by Toll-like receptor 3. cellular proteases such as trypsin, tryptase Clara, miniplasmin, human airway trypsin-like protease and TMPRSS2 cleave the HA glycoprotein of influenza A viruses. several proteases, including other serine proteases, may activate both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, allowing the virus to spread to alveolar areas in TMPRSS2-deficient mice. however, viral spread and inflammatory infiltration were still detected in the alveoli. expression of FGF-basic, also known as FGF2, after infection synchronized with peak body weight loss in WT and hDPP4-Tg mice. FGFs play a role in tissue repair after pneumonia, including bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) and interstitial pneumonia (both fibrous pulmonary disorders), by promoting proliferation of fibroblasts. the immune responses to poly(IC) treatment in hDPP4-Tg mice were quite different from those in 14- to 16-week-old C57BL/6 mice. hDPP4 expression did not have a marked effect on basal innate immune responses in 10-week-old C57BL/6 and hDPP4-Tg mice. however, hDPP4-Tg mice showed slightly stronger or earlier innate immune responses than C57BL/6 mice (25). inflammatory chemokine and cytokine levels in TMPRSS2-KO mice were lower even after intranasal stimulation by poly(IC). TMPRSS2 plays a role in the spread and immunopathology of coronaviruses in the airways. TMPRSS2/ mice were established from TMPRSS2 gene knockout C57BL/6 embryonic stem (ES) cells. chimeric mice with a complete C57BL/6 genetic background were generated. transgenic mice expressing the human DPP4 gene (hDPP4-Tg mice) were then backcrossed with TMPRSS2 knockout mice for eight generations. mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of 1.0 mg of ketamine and 0.02 mg of xylazine. TMPRSS2-KO mice, C57BL/6 mice lacking a homologous genotype of the TMPRSS2 gene (TMPRSS2/) (20), and C57BL/6 mice (WT mice; TMPRSS2+/+) were inoculated intranasally with SARS-CoV (105 intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of 1.0 mg of ketamine and 0.02 mg of xylazine. all mice were sacrificed 24 h after administration for analysis of cytokine expression. antigen retrieval from formalin-fixed mouse tissue sections was performed by autoclaving in retrieval solution (pH 6.0) at 121\u00b0C for 10 min. antigen retrieval from formalin-fixed sections was performed by autoclaving in retrieval solution (pH 6.0) mRNAs encoding IFN-, IFN-, and TLR3 were examined by real-time RT-PCR using an ABI Prism 7900HT Fast real-time PCR system. expression of each gene was normalized to that of -actin. expression of each gene was normalized to that of -actin. stocks of a mouse-passaged Frankfurt 1 isolate of SARS-CoV and F-musX-Vero E6 were propagated twice, titrated on Vero E6 cells, and cryopreserved at 80\u00b0C. TMPRSS2/ mice were established from TMPRSS2 gene knockout C57BL/6 embryonic stem (ES) cells. genic mice expressing the human DPP4 gene (hDPP4-Tg mice) were generated by microinjection of purified bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones carrying the hDPP4 gene into the pronuclei of fertilized eggs. the transgenic mice were then backcrossed with C57BL/6NCr mice for eight generations and subsequently crossed with homozygous TMPRSS2 knockout (TMPRSS2/) mice. hDPP4+/ TMPRSS2/ C57BL/6 mice were inoculated intranasally with TMPRSS2-KO mice. infected mice were observed for clinical signs of infection. body weight was measured daily for 10 days or 14 days. serum was collected from mice sacrificed on day 10 or 14 p.i. plasma titers of neutralizing antibodies were calculated as the reciprocal of the highest dilution at which no cytopathic effect was observed. lowest and highest dilutions tested were 4 and 256 or 64. inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in mouse lung homogenates (10%, wt/vol) were measured using a commercial mouse Cytokine 20-Plex antibody bead kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and a Luminex 100 apparatus (Luminex Co., Austin, TX) weight curves, virus titers, and multiplex assay results were analyzed using one-way or two-way analysis of variance. significant effects of viral titers in different animal strains at different time points were assessed by two-way ANOVA."}
