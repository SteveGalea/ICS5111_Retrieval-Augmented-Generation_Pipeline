{"summary": "a number of environmental parameters vary predictably with latitude. the examination of natural populations across latitudinal gradients has been widely used to elucidate fundamental aspects of spatially variable selection. changes in natural populations for various fitness-related traits among seasons demonstrate evolutionary responses to seasonal shifts in selective pressures. patterns have been documented on most continents, including the Indian subcontinent (Rajpurohit, Parkash, and Ramniwas 2008; Rajpurohit et al. 2008; Rajpurohit and Nedved 2013), North America (Schmidt, Matzkin, et al. 2005; Schmidt, Paaby, et al. 2010); and South America (Folguera et al. 2008; Goenaga et al. 2013); and Africa the selective regimes associated with high and low latitudes are in many ways similar to those associated with winter and summer seasonality. both high latitude and winter seasons are associated with lower temperature and scarce resources. both low latitude and summer seasons are associated with elevated temperature and abundant resources. diapause incidence is shown to be a powerful predictor of a suite of other traits associated with organismal fitness. clinal and seasonal patterns of diapause incidence may represent a fundamental trade-off between somatic maintenance and reproduction. diapause is constitutive and invariant within populations under stressful environments. a comprehensive genomic and transcriptomic analysis of diapause in Drosophila is lacking. a genome-wide transcriptomic profiling of heads and ovaries was performed in diapausing and nondiapausing individuals. this is the first comprehensive expression profile of diapause in an organism that has naturally different perception of the same environmental cues. this is the first comprehensive expression profile of diapause in an organism that has naturally different perception of the same environmental cues. all genes previously shown to affect diapause have DE isoform(s) in at least one of the two tissues, confirming their association with the phenotype. genes downregulated in heads of diapausing flies are significantly enriched for clinal and seasonal SNPs. a large number of genes are DE between diapausing (D) and nondiapausing (ND) individuals. this is true both in head and ovary (9% in all tested genes in head and 11% in all tested genes in ovary; table 1). only 165 genes are DE in both head and ovary, of which 41 show opposite regulation in the two tissues. the inconsistency of transcriptional regulation in head and ovary as a function of the diapause phenotype advocates analysis of different tissue and body parts. the frequencies of In(2L)t, In(2R)Ns, In(3R)C, In(3R)K, and In(3R)Mo are not different between diapausing and nondiapausing samples. the regions containing the inversion-specific SNPs of In(3L)P and In(3R)Payne are not transcribed so we are not able to assess their frequencies from our data. isoforms have opposite patterns of regulation in D and ND. these antagonistic effects may cancel out and make the gene not DE in the gene-level tests. we identified enriched functional categories using gene ontology analysis. KEGG pathways are downregulated in diapause heads according to KEGG enrichment. flies in diapause may generate and/or consume less energy. flies may generate and/or consume less energy. two isoforms of cpo show opposite regulation in the ovaries. the regulation of each isoform shows antagonistic directions in different parts of the body. this suggests that the effects of tim on diapause are transcript and tissue specific. e 5,731 3,611 0.714 False Dp110 1,987 2,119 0.991 False 4,820 3,855 0.974 False Table 5 Transcript-Level Expression of Candidate Diapause Genes (expression levels are normalized and in units of RPKM) False 367 202 0.785 False cpo-RO 5,559 3,835 0.594 False 370 0 0.000 True cpo-RP 0.951 False tim-RP Low Low NA NA tim-RR 8,026 7,547 0.995 False 4,693 2,487 0.841 False tim-RS Low Low NA NA Dp110 Pi3K92E-RA 1,193 1,539 0.693 False 3,835 3,623 0.981 False Pi3K92E-RB 848 525 0.058 False 1,293 0 0.000 False Pi3K insulin-like peptide Ilp-4 is upregulated, and Ilp7 and Ilp8 are downregulated in ovaries of diapausing flies. the genes dock, foxo, InR, Pdk1, Pten and RpL8 have DE transcripts in the heads. the null distributions are located on the far right side of the null distributions generated by randomizing the locations of genes within the chromosome. chromosome location-based coregulation of gene expression is present in the transcriptional regulation of diapause. the enrichment of seasonal/clinal genes in genes that are downregulated in diapausing heads was tested with a block-bootstrapping method. a significant enrichment of seasonal genes in genes that are downregulated in diapausing heads (P = 0.022) clinal overlap gene list has 98 seasonal genes that are downregulated in diapausing heads. mainly located on chromosomes 2 and 3 and the locations of these genes are not associated with cosmopolitan inversions. many of these genes\u2019 functions are completely unknown either from experimental evidence or from prediction based on sequence similarities. a large number of genes are DE between diapausing (D) and nondiapausing (ND) individuals. in the head, 6,237 genes fall above the line of y = 0. in the ovary, 5,272 genes fall above the line and 5,584 genes fall below. only 165 genes are DE in both head and ovary, of which 41 show opposite regulation in the two tissues. the inconsistency of transcriptional regulation in head and ovary advocates analysis of different tissue and body parts in the dissection of mechanisms of diapause. the frequencies of In(2L)t, In(2R)Ns, In(3R)C, In(3R)K, and In(3R)Mo are at low frequencies in our experimental population. the regions containing the inversion-specific SNPs of In(3L)P and In(3R)Payne are not transcribed so we are not able to assess their frequencies. compared with the gene-level DE detection, the isoform-level tests identified many more genes with at least 1 DE isoform. the majority of genes (more than 60%) identified from the gene-level tests have at least 1 DE isoform. gene-level and isoform-level differential expression tests identified enriched functional categories using gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and the Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathways analysis. transduction 3.34 107 7 25 Downregulated in KEGG enrichment. flies in diapause may generate and/or consume less energy. there is also a downregulation of \"fatty acid degradation\" and \"other glycan degradation\" expression levels are normalized and in units of RPKM.

GO terms such as \"ribosome biogenesis,\" \"ribonucleoprotein complex biogenesis,\" and \"rRNA metabolic process\" are among the most significantly enriched biological processes. genes related to ribosome biogenesis are upregulated in diapausing heads. phototransduction genes are expected to play a role in the regulation of diapause. the perceived change in photoperiod is an anticipatory environmental cue. it was previously shown that circadian genes are expressed in multiple tissues. the canonical histones are shut down in diapausing ovaries but not in diapausing heads, suggesting that the cell cycle arrest is specific to the ovaries. despite that, the observed data for head and ovary are still quite distinct. diapause is a globally regulated syndrome. the genes that are DE as a function of the naturally occurring variation in diapause phenotype represent a nonrandom set. the genes that are DE as a function of the naturally occurring variation in diapause are a nonrandom set. apausing heads are more likely than expected to show seasonal and clinal patterns of adaptation. genes that are shut down during diapause may simply represent a suspension of development or reduced metabolic activity. genes that are upregulated in diapausing heads are more likely than expected. vitellogenesis and egg formation related terms are enriched in genes that are downregulated in diapausing head. these genes are likely pleiotropic and may have important functions outside the ovary. gene expression levels of yolk proteins Yp1, Yp2 and Yp3 are dozens of times higher in heads. a group of 90 histones are located on the right end of chromosome 2L from cytogenetic location 39D3 to 39E1. the canonical histones are shut down in diapausing ovaries but not in diapausing heads, suggesting that the cell cycle arrest is specific to the ovaries. the two genes H3.3A and H3.3B that encode the variant are expressed at a relatively constant level throughout the cell cycle. chromosome regions containing genes open for translational regulation increase accessibility of cis- and trans-regulatory elements of their neighboring genes. local sharing of cis- and trans-regulatory elements could activate the target genes as well as its adjacent genes. a high level of spatial autocorrelation of transcriptional regulation is present in diapause. genes that are de as a function of the naturally occurring variation in diapause phenotype represent a nonrandom set. genes that are downregulated in diapausing heads are more likely than expected to show both seasonal and clinal patterns of adaptation. genes that are shut down during diapause represent a suspension of development or reduced metabolic activity. ten females and ten males from a single age cohort for each isofemale line were released into laboratory population cages. the outbred population was constructed less than 6 months after the flies were collected from the wild. the population was maintained as four experimental replicates. reads were mapped to the D. melanogaster reference transcriptome. expression levels of genes and isoforms were estimated following the RNA-Seq by Expectation-Maximization. genes involved in vitellogenesis and oogenesis are at much higher expression levels in developed ovaries compared with development-arrested ovaries. the drastic difference of these genes in D and ND ovaries alone can affect the detection of other DE genes. to address this issue, we excluded the genes under the GO term \u201cvitellogenesis\u201d and \u201coogenesis\u201d. the log2-fold changes of expression levels in D versus ND were calculated using Moran\u2019s I (Moran 1950) null distributions of spatial autocorrelation for each chromosome arm were generated by randomly scrambling the locations of genes within the chromosome. a gene that was not DE, but of similar length and normalized mean RPKM value, was established as a control. five hundred sets of control genes were generated for each DE list. odds ratios of DE genes being seasonal/clinal relative to the control genes are calculated. the population was maintained as four experimental replicates. a total of 92 flies went into the pooled diapause samples. a total of 106 flies went into the pooled nondiapause samples. cDNA libraries were prepared as previously described. reads were mapped to the D. melanogaster reference transcriptome. expression levels of genes and isoforms were estimated following the RNA-Seq by Expectation-Maximization. to address this issue, we excluded the genes under the GO term \u201cvitellogenesis\u201d and \u201coogenesis\u201d and reran the differential expression analysis on the ovary data. the estimation of the expression levels for the other genes is not affected by the removal of vitellogenesis and oogenesis genes, and the list of DE genes is not affected. the list of tandemly arrayed duplicated genes was obtained from Quijano et al. (2008). the list of tandemly arrayed duplicated genes was obtained from Quijano et al. five hundred sets of control genes were generated for each DE list. odds ratios of DE genes being seasonal/clinal relative to the control genes are calculated."}
