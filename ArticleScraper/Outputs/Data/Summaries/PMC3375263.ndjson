{"summary": "three influenza A pandemics have taken place in 1918\u20131919 (H1N1), 1957 (H2N2) and 1968 (H3N2), which killed up to 50 million people all over the world. the virus originated in waterfowl; due to antigenic mutations, the mutation in the receptor-binding domains (RBDs) could result in a human pandemic similar to H1N1. a small amount of SA--2,3-Gal also appears in the lower respiratory airway and breast milk in humans. HA must change its receptor-binding preference from SA--2,3-Gal to SA--2,6-Gal [12] to cross the species barrier. glycans near the antigenic epitopes interfere with antibody recognition to escape immune pressure from hosts. the gain or loss of glycosylation sites near the HA0 cleavage site can also affect viral receptor recognition [20], [21]. s on HA increased its binding affinity while decreasing its specificity toward disparate SA receptors. computational methods were adopted to further explore the binding affinity between HA and SA receptors. commonly, researchers focused on the interactions between HA and different SA receptors. phylogenetic tree was constructed using the Neighbor-Joining method and the Poisson correction model in MEGA 5.05 [30] the internal branching probabilities were determined by bootstrap analysis with 1,000 replicates. only the chain A and B in 3GBM, which represent HA1 and HA2, respectively, were extracted by PyMOL 0.99 and used as an HA monomer [31], [32]. four glycans on glycosylated HAs are represented by MG, HM, DS and FG respectively. eight sialoglycans and one pentaglucose are used for docking assays. all of the systems were energy-minimized for 0.5 ns with the protein and glycan atoms fixed and then for another 0.5 ns with all of the atoms relaxed. the temperature was held at 300 K using Langevin dynamics, and the pressure was held at 1 atm by the Langevin piston method. production runs were performed for another 10 ns for each HA model. a 5-glucose-pentose (5GLC) was used as a negative quality control. all receptors were constructed by the SWEET2 program. each model was docked with 9 receptors by turns. the angle parameter, which define the angle between the C2 atom of SA1 and the C1 atoms of Gal2 and GlcNAc3 (or Man3), was used to describe the topologies adopted by various sialoglycans. the initial conformations of 5 ns docked MD simulation were attained from optimal trimer sialoglycan-FG docking complexes. unrooted phylogenetic tree was constructed using the Neighbor-Joining method. only the chain A and B in 3GBM, which represent HA1 and HA2, were extracted by PyMOL 0.99 and used as an HA monomer [31], [32]. mono N-acetyl-D-glucosamine HA (MG) had only one N-acetyl-D-glucosamine residue on 158N. high-mannosylation HA (HM) represented a mannose-rich glycan. only one glycan is added on 158N near the RBD. the largest system had 70,000 atoms (including protein, glycan and waters) in a 140 70 70 cuboid of TIP3P water molecules. all of the systems were energy-minimized for 0.5 ns with the protein and glycan atoms fixed and then for another 0.5 ns with all of the atoms relaxed. four SA--2,3-Gal analogs and four SA--2,6-Gal analogs were designed and constructed to mimic the sialoglycans on human and avian cells. these receptors could be divided into four types: lactosialyltetraoses (LSTa/LSTc), disialyllacto-N-tetraose (3DSLNT/6DSLNT; 6DSLNT does not actually exist in humans) and the results were analyzed by cluster analysis in their largest cluster. for each flexible docking, the three binding models with the lowest binding energies were selected. the flexible docking calculation and complementary analysis were performed on a Windows XP workstation. a nomenclature system devised for H5N1 in 2008, the HAs can be divided into ten phylogenetic clades (0\u20139), of which three clades, namely clade 0, clade 1 and clade 2, are responsible for most human infections. there was a marked divergence in the last four years, as several new subclades emerged and predominated in the H5N1 epidemics. clades 1.1, 2.2.1, 2.2.1.1, 2.2.2, 2.3.2.1, 2.3.4, 2.3.4.2 and 7.1 were not detected for the past 4 years. the homology of the 3602 HA dataset was rather low, 25 out 325 amino-acid residues in HA1 revealed an identity rate of 100%. sporadic deficiency cases have been reported in China, Vietnam and Egypt. most of these cases were in clade 2.2.1 or clade 7.1. most of these cases were in clade 2.2.1 or clade 7.1. clade 1.1 or clade 2.3.4 in Southeast Asia were conservative for the 158N glycosylation site. this discrepancy confirms no close relationship exists between the loss of the 158N glycosylation site and host switching. approximately 55 dual-glycosylation site (158N and 169N) deficiency virus were responsible for avian infections. the similarity of the last four HA sequence was 98.27%, with the identical RBD (Figure 4). the last four HA sequence was 98.27%, with the identical RBD. two strains mentioned above are responsible for human infections. ative Flexible Glycans Glycosylation exerts significant influence on envelope glycoproteins. many oligosaccharide NOEs (Nuclear Overhouser Effects) also cannot be resolved. many oligosaccharide NOEs are difficult to assign by NMR. the interaction of the basic group in 222Lys with the newly introduced, weakly acidic amide group of the S227N residue in 03HK indicated the steric alteration. the glycan residues at 158N of affect their acroteric amino-acid residues. the glycan residues in the core are more stable compared with the terminal glycan residues. the higher RMSFs in the distal monosaccharide residues revealed their active fluctuation. the interaction between HA and SA receptors could be deemed as a docking mechanism. a notable tendency is the increasing binding energy accompanying with increasing glycos. the average binding energies collected from the glycosylated HAs were higher than those from 04VN and 03HK. there is no obvious numerical difference between the two types of sialoglycan docking assays. -sialoglycans adopt the trans or cis conformation, respectively. most antepenultimate residues would form a 1-3 or 1-4 glycosidic linkage with the penultimate -D-Gal. most antepenultimate residues would form a 1-3 or 1-4 glycosidic linkage with the penultimate -D-Gal. most receptors are straight and extrorse, while the SA--2,6-Gal receptors are fishhook-like and ental. the rest of the residues in LSTc exhibited more contact with Helix190 compared with LSTa. the estimated curvilinear distance between two RBDs is approximately 60. the maximum distance between two SAs in most bi- or tri-antennary sialoglycans is shorter (30\u201340) hydroxy group at the -C atom can form an H-bond with other polar groups, such as water or the receptor. residue 227Ser did not participate directly in stabilizing interactions with the penultimate Gal. a persistent H-bond between 226Gln and Gal formed in several HA--2,3-sialoglycan docking complexes. the presence of huge N-glycans would impact the binding efficacy of the RBD. some glycosylation sites appear to be far from one RBD (>25) but their glycans still affect the binding affinity for the adjoining 169N. the distance between the center of the RBD and the third glycosylated site, 158N in chain E, is approximately 35\u201340. huge glycans around the RBD would restrict the affinity and specificity of HA. phylogenetic analysis of glycosylation sites of HA in H5N1 Virus. a nomenclature system devised for H5N1 in 2008, the HAs can be divided into ten phylogenetic clades (0\u20139) of which three clades, namely clade 0, clade 1 and clade 2, are responsible for most human infections. clades 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 were responsible for most human cases in North Africa and Southeastern Asian. another major group, clade 1, was responsible for most documented human infections in Asia during 2004\u20132005, Thailand during 2006 and Cambodia during 2010\u20132012. clade 1.1 reemerged in Cambodia with a 100% human fatality rate. the amino-acid residues in the RBD of H5N1 HA are labeled in yellow. the predominant amino-acid residues are labeled in yellow. the number of different types of mutations are shown as different blocks. virus with 158N glycosylation site deficiency existed in nine clades extensively. most recent human records belonging to clade 2.2.1 in north africa stayed a stable 158N glycosylation site deficiency. the human virus belonging to clade 2.3.4 in Southeast Asia were conservative for the 158N glycosylation site. seven H5 HA structure files were available, of which three incomplete structures represent the A/Duck/Singapore/3/97 monomer. the files of 2FKO and 3GBM correspond to A/Viet Nam/1203/2004, whereas 2IBX and 3FKU represented A/Viet Nam/1194/2004 [48], [49], [50] the RBDs are shown in blue lines with the identical amino acids marked with asterisks. the glycosylation site 158N are boxed in red, whereas the four most conserved residues at the bottom of the RBD are boxed in green. residues, 95Tyr, 153Trp, 183His and 195Tyr, located at the bottom of the RBD, had lower RMSFs compare with the non-conserved residues. the RMSF of 222Lys in 03HK decreased, which was responsible for the interaction of the basic group in 222Lys with the newly introduced, weakly acidic amide group of the S227N residue. RMSDs of longer glycans in HM, DS and FG had similar features. at the minimization stage, the RMSDs rose vigorously; however, the whole glycan became stable and convergent immediately. the higher RMSFs in the distal monosaccharide residues revealed their active fluctuation. humans exposed to a high concentration of A/Viet Nam/1203/2004 strains would also be infected. a notable tendency is the increasing binding energy accompanying increasing glycosylation. the average binding energies collected from the HAs were higher than those from 04VN and 03HK. hydroxyl, hydroxyl, N-acetyl and glycerol group are four functional groups in SA residue that participate in numerous hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) and hydrophobic interactions with the RBD. the hydroxyl groups in the penultimate Gal and Loop220 are responsible for host preference. SA--2,3-Gal receptors are superimposed with distal SA residues at left. the SA--2,6-Gal receptors are superimposed with distal SA residues at left. the branched 3DSLNT is the most abundant sialyl human milk oligosaccharide. one biantennary sialoglycan molecule cannot dock with two RBDs in a trimer HAs due to the short distance between the two antennas. the estimated curvilinear distance between two RBDs is approximately 60. the maximum distance between two SAs in most bi- or tri-antennary sialoglycans is shorter (30\u201340 ). residue 194Leu or 190Glu, located in Helix190, would form an H-bond with the antepenultimate GlcNAc/Man, especially in -2,6-sialoglycans. a persistent H-bond between 226Gln and Gal formed in several docking complexes but rarely in HA--2,6-sialoglycans docking complexes. all of the glycosylated HAs except MG exhibited a clearly weakened binding ability. the topologies of glycans, the distribution of hydroxy groups in different saccharide residues, the amide group in GalNAc and the groups in SA would also affect the binding affinity. a previous survey showed that the conservation rate of the 169N glycosylation site is 95.73%. an S171A change would result in the loss of this glycosylation site. the distance between the center of the RBD to the center of each glycan is approximately 35\u201340. three glycans on 158N and 169N were swinging dramatically. extrorse topologies were observed in the free and docked SA--2,3-Gal receptors. loss of the 169N glycosylation site facilitates the recognition of the fishhook-like and ental -2,6-sialoglycans. outbreak and epidemic HAs have a high preference for SA--2,6-Gal in humans compared with SA--2,3-Gal in avian hosts. the Q226L and G228S mutations in H2N2 and H3N2 would also lead to host switching. but H5N1 has not been reported to have such definite mutations until now. a reconstructed 03HK-RBD-like HA model revealed that 03HK has a negative influence on the binding of SA--2,3-Gal. this change could be one reason that 03HK has a dual-host affinity. this change could be one reason that 03HK has a dual-host affinity. a typical monomer affinity in GBP is measured at the millimolar level. the topologies of the three RBDs in the HA trimer face to three symmetry directions would facilitate the binding of the host SA glycans. the deficiency of the 169N glycosylation site only appears in avian infection virus. sialyglacans are shown as the cyan CPK models. nine representative conformations of sialoglycan from 5 ns intervals are superimposed with distal SA residues. it clearly revealed the remainder of all SA--2,3-Gal receptors are leftward, compare to the rightward SA--2,6-Gal receptors. the glycosylation sites are marked in red. the 100% conserved residues are marked in cyan."}
