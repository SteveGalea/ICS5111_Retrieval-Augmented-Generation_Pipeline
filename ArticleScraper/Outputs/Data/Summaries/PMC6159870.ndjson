{"summary": "bats can harbor protozoa and bacteria of potential zoonotic relevance. phylogenetic analyses show bats are reservoirs of zoonotic Candidatus B. mayotimonensis [18\u201320], a causative agent of human endocarditis [21], and exhibit high genetic diversity. global analyses suggest geographic structure in bat Bartonella genotypes. common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) have high prevalence of Bartonella throughout their large geographic range in Latin America [15,16,24,44] Vampire bat sampling Samples were collected in 2015 and 2016 across seven sites in Peru. we sampled sites one to two times annually, capturing one to 17 individuals per site and sampling interval. to screen for Bartonella by PCR, up to 30 L blood was stored on Whatman FTA cards at room temperature. PCR products were purified with DNA Clean & Concentrator Kits (Zymo Research) chromatograms were checked for quality and trimmed using Geneious (Biomatters) Phylogenetic analyses were carried out in MrBayes using the GTR+gamma model suggested by jModeltest2 [56]. for dataset 1 (Desmodus-associated sequences), we fit a codon partitioned substitution model by linking rates in codon positions 1 and 2 separately from codon position 3. dataset 2 included one sequence from Brucella abortus as an outgroup [13] to assess seasonality in infection, we fit a separate GLMM with season (spring, summer, fall) as a predictor to data from two sites in Peru (AM1 and CA1) sampled across seasons (n = 63). to identify individual risk factors for Bartonella infection, we fit a single GLMM with bat age, forearm size, sex, and reproductive status. three saliva and three fecal pools were sequenced, each containing nucleic acid extractions from swabs collected from ten vampire bats from one to two colonies. pooled samples contained individuals from the same colonies of bats tested for Bartonella in blood through PCR. individual reads and contigs were screened for sequences matching Bartonella. the gltA gene is not highly transcribed, we also tested sequences for matches to bartonella DNA-directed RNA polymerase subunit B. swabs were preserved in 2 mL RNAlater (Invitrogen) at \u201380\u00b0C until laboratory analyses. for Peru sites sampled in 2016, we also recorded the number of bat flies per vampire bat. post-trimmed forward and reverse sequences were assembled to create 348 base pair (bp) consensus sequences for each sample (n = 35; the quality of 16 chromatograms was too low) Sequences with >99.7% similarity were considered the same genetic variant [54]. dataset 1 was designed to assess spatial structure of vampire bat\u2013associated Bartonella across Latin America. both datasets were run for 2.5 million generations with convergence checked and burn-in periods selected by assessing posterior traces in Tracer [57]. Statistical analyses of Bartonella infection status We analyzed 193 samples from Desmodus rotundus to test whether temporal variation and individual risk factors explain differences in Bartonella infection. we fit a single GLMM with bat age, forearm size, sex, and reproductive status. included interactions between sex and reproduction, sex and age, sex and forearm size, and reproduction and forearm size. we included categorical livestock biomass as a predictor in the GLMM to control for a previously observed negative association with Bartonella infection. the libraries included in this study were combined in equimolar ratios with other metagenomic libraries for sequencing on an Illumina NextSeq500. reads were demultiplexed according to barcode and quality filtered using TrimGalore [63,64] with a minimum read length of 75 bp, and clipping the first 14 bp of the read. we screened cleaned reads for the Bartonella genotypes detected in this study using nucleot phylogenetic analysis of 35 vampire bat Bartonella sequences showed 78.8\u2013100% pairwise identity in gltA and revealed at least 11 paraphyletic genotypes. genomes 1 and 2 were detected across all regions, and genotypes 7\u201310 were detected within both regions of Peru. genotype 3 was unique to both regions of Peru, genotypes 4\u20136 were unique to western Peru. all sequences are displayed with their GenBank accession numbers. the tips of all sequences are colored by geography. diamonds depict posterior probabilities of nodes greater than 50%. eight sequences were novel (96% identity to GenBank sequences) but were most similar to Bartonella from phytophagous bats in Costa Rica. bartonella sequences from this study are displayed with genotype, bat ID numbers, and accession numbers. diamonds depict posterior probabilities of nodes greater than 50%. BLAST procedure found no bartonella seqeunces similar to those recently described in brazilian bat or rodent species [70\u201372] Temporal patterns in infection Bartonella was detected by PCR in all nine sites in each year, with prevalence ranging from 30\u2013100%. the odds of Bartonella infection were highest for vampire bats with larger forearms (OR = 1.2, p0.001) and for males (OR = 5.41, p0.01), were marginally higher for non-reproductive individuals (OR = 2.36, p = 0.10); our sample did not contain juveniles. saliva pool from Amazonas had no matching Bartonella-like reads or contigs. bartonella ancashensis, B. australis, and B. bacilliformis were all identified at both the read and contig level in fecal samples. phylogenetic analyses suggest all sequences shared a minimum of 97% identity to one or more of our 35 blood-derived Bartonella sequences. in many cases, saliva and fecal sequences were the same genotype as blood sequences derived from the same geographic region. BLAST still demonstrated that the closest relatives were all derived from vampire bats. genomes 1 and 2 were detected across all regions. genotypes 7\u201310 were detected within both regions. genotype 3 was unique to both regions of Peru, genotypes 4\u20136 were unique to the western Peruvian Amazon. half of our Peruvian and Belizian sequences (18/35) were nearly identical (>99.7% identity) to Bartonella from common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) from Mexico. other sequences fell within the same clade (>96% pairwise identity) as Bartonella from bat flies (Strebla diaemi) in Panama (JX416251), from parnell's mustached bat (Pteronotus parnell BLAST procedure found no bartonella seqeunces similar to those recently described in brazilian bat or rodent species. prevalence did not differ by year across all sites, nor within individual sites. seasonality GLMM for the western Peruvian Amazon (n = 63) showed no difference in odds of infection between spring, summer, and fall (2 = 1.99, p = 0.37; S2 Fig). recaptures were rare (n = 6) but showed changes in infection from negative to positive (n = 2, 68\u2013424 days) and from positive to negative (n = 2, 15\u2013369 days; S3 Fig). ectoparasite intensity (OR = 0.98, p = 0.81) and ectoparasite presence (2 = 1.13, p = 0.29) were associated with bartonella infection status. the majority of infected bats in this sample were infested with at least one bat fly (31/36) bartonella ancashensis, B. australis, and B. bacilliformis were all identified at both the read and contig level in fecal samples. nested PCR of individual swabs detected gltA in 21.4% of saliva samples (6/28) and 30% of fecal samples (9/30) a survey of vampire bats within Guatemala found no geographic, dietary, demographic, or viral coinfection correlates of Bartonella infection status. the bartonella genotypes we identified were paraphyletic and closely related to those from other vampire bat populations, other Neotropical bat species or bat flies. several bartonella genotypes were present in vampire bats from both central and south America. however, we suspect this clustering mostly resulted from variation in locally abundant genotypes rather than true barriers to the spread of Bartonella. the biogeography of the pathogen may have followed that of its host. high bartonella prevalence in bats has been proposed to stem from persistent infection [15] this seems unlikely, as we observed possible clearance of infection in some recaptured bats. however, we do note that our sample only contained adult (n = 162) and subadult (n = 28) bats, limiting more robust tests of age-dependent infection. larger forearm size could relate to direct contact if larger bats are more dominant and aggressive, as found in other phyllostomid bat species. male bats had higher odds of Bartonella infection but did not differ in their bat fly intensities compared to females. metagenomics and PCR detected no bartonella DNA matching to gltA or rpoB in either saliva or fecal pools. this absence could be explained in that the short sequences (345\u2013425 bp) used as targets, and the large size of bacterial genomes together make the likelihood of detecting a specific gene low. fecal and blood PCR results also showed strong correspondence between blood and saliva. discrepancy could suggest incidental ingestion of ectoparasites during grooming. similar prevalence of bartonella in saliva and feces suggests direct contact and environmental exposure. bartonella has been detected in ticks infesting other bats. these ectoparasites could also facilitate cross-species transmission. phylogenetic analyses of bartonella in vampire bats are therefore needed. pairwise similarity (%) between each vampire bat Bartonella genotype from this study and the top 10 BLAST hits from GenBank. bartonella-like reads were identified by diamond protein blast. read matches are a list of those that were identified as Bartonella based on nucleotide blast. ces from our study are listed with genotype, bat ID numbers, and accession numbers. red tips display recent gltA sequences from Brazilian bats and rodents. lack of seasonality in vampire bat Bartonella from western Peruvian Amazon sites."}
