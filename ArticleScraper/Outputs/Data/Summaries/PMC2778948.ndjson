{"summary": "Furin is a crucial member of secretory mammalian subtilases. it has been linked to cancer, tumorgenesis, viral and bacterial pathogenesis. it is considered a major target for intervention of these diseases. isin/Kexins (PCSKs) is responsible for endoproteolytic cleavage of inactive protein precursors at the general sequence motif (K/R)-(X)n-(R) leading to functionally active secretory proteins and polypeptides [1]\u2013[3]. furin has been strongly linked to tumorgenesis, hormonal diseases, neurological dementia and a variety of infectious diseases caused by ebola, avian, Hong Kong, HIV, human SARS cor we report for the first time a new and innovative strategy for the design of a potent furin inhibitor. this approach was primarily based on a specially constructed unnatural amino acid called \u201cEda or enediynyl amino acid\u201d and its incorporation at the cleavage site of prodomain sequence of furin. this role is to regulate protease activity by providing proper folding after binding. several enediynes of both synthetic and fungal metabolite origins have been shown to display strong antitumor activity [31], [40]. a few of these compounds have been approved as anti-cancer drugs. enediyne derivatives can degrade proteins under suitable conditions. we first synthesized several aromatic enediyne derivatives [44] and examined their effects on proteolytic activities of three key members of PC-family enzymes. the most potent inhibitory activity was noted against PC7 for compound AB-2 which displayed an IC50 value of 8.5 M. this is the first report of PC-inhibitory activity of an enediyne compound. lmethoxy carbonyl group so that it can be directly used in solid phase peptide synthesis. table shows IC50 values for inhibition of recombinant proprotein convertases furin, PC5 and PC7 by various aromatic enediyne compounds. furin-eda-peptide (II) contains a highly reactive -turn inducing unnatural Eda-amino acid inserted between the scissile Arg-Asp amide bond. it is likely that such a peptide bond is efficiently cleaved by furin in in vitro and ex vivo conditions. peptide analog will be sensitive to changes in pH, metal ion concentrations and other environmental conditions such as UV light [32]. such chemical transformation and modification may induce protease inhibitory activity to the peptide derivative. furin-Eda-peptide (II) inhibited furin activity in vitro with a high degree of potency. progress curve and stopped-time assays showed that 125 nM of (II) was able to block furin activity almost completely against the above substrate (20 M) the measured IC50 value was found to be 70 nM. furin-Eda-peptide blocks furin cleavage of intramolecularly quenched fluorogenic peptide hSARS-CoV spike754\u2013766 Abz-AEQDRNTR761 EVFAQ-Tyx-A. furin-Eda-peptide blocks furin cleavage of intramolecularly quenched fluorogenic peptide hSARS-CoV spike754\u2013766 Abz-A cleavage of 22 kDa pro-PDGF-A to 14 kDa mature PDGF-A was reflected by the strong appearance of 22 kDa proPDGF-A band. this was completely absent in the control experiment done in parallel without the presence of any inhibitor. effect was compared in parallel with that done with the known furin inhibitor dec-RVRR-cmk. effects of Furin-Eda-Peptide on proPDGF-B processing furin-eda-peptide (II) on proPDGF-B processing furin-mediated processing of 31 kDa pro-PDGF-B to 17 kDa mature form in CHO cells. results were highly comparable with those conducted in parallel with 1-Pdx protein, another known potent inhibitor of furin [50] the results were also depicted by densitometric analysis of the observed bands. a similar conclusion was also reached by protein staining data of the bands with silver ions. the 55 kDa furin band represents the soluble form of furin protein. docking of furin-Eda-peptide with the P-Domain of Furin Enzyme Enediynes is known to undergo Bergman cyco-aromatization reaction even under mild condition (32) we postulate that the observed inhibition of furin activity by furin-Eda-peptide may be mediated by the cyclic (IIa) rather than the acyclic (II) form. this is the best fit docking structure obtained between the cyclic furin-Eda peptide (IIa) and any part of furin protein. this is the best fit docking structure obtained between the cyclic furin-Eda peptide (IIa) and any part of furin protein. this is the best fit docking structure obtained between the cyclic furin-Eda peptide and any part of furin protein. furin-Eda peptide exists mostly in beta-sheet and random structures with very little helix content (10%) under all pH conditions (5.5\u20138.0) tested. there were slight changes in CD profile particularly at 200\u2013205 nm area. this may possibly due to partial transformation of sheet structure to random or turn structure. addition of CaCl2 to the medium quenches the fluorescence intensity in a dose dependent manner. 1 mM CaCl2 can fully suppress the fluorescence as shown by the spectrum. it was found to exhibit excitation and emission peaks at 320 and 440 nm respectively. in vitro enzyme assay of PCs against Boc-RVRR-MCA substrate (50 M) indicated weak to modest inhibitory activities of these compounds. most potent inhibitory activity was noted against PC7 for compound AB-2 which displayed an IC50 value of 8.5 M. the enzyme assay was carried out by using the fluorogenic peptide substrate Boc-RVRR-MCA (50 M final concentration) as described in [27]. ND = not determined. the multiple steps involved in the synthesis are shown in self explanatory way in Fig. 2A. furin-eda-peptide (II) contains a highly reactive -turn inducing unnatural Eda-amino acid inserted between the scissile Arg-Asp amide bond. it is likely that such a peptide analog will be sensitive to changes in pH, metal ion concentrations and other environmental conditions such as UV light. ide (II) was synthesized by HATU/DIEA (Diisopropyl ethyl amine) mediated solid phase Fmoc chemistry [18], [26] and purified by RP-HPLC. peak eluting at Rt = 26.5 min was collected and analyzed by a second HPLC-run on an analytical C18 column. the identity of the peptide was further confirmed by SELDI-tof mass 125 nM of (II) was able to block furin activity against the above substrate (20 M) this effect was found to be concentration-dependent. the measured IC50 value was found to be 70 nM. furin-Eda-peptide blocks furin cleavage of intramolecularly quenched fluorogenic peptide hSARS-CoV spike754\u2013766 Abz-AEQDRNTR761 EVFAQ-Tyx-A. results were compared in parallel with commercial furin inhibitor Dec (decanoyl)-RVRR-cmk (chloromethyl ketone) and the synthetic full length prodomain protein of hfur effect of furin-Eda-peptide (50 M) on furin-mediated processing of proVEGF-C in CHO cells. the effect was compared in parallel with that done with the known furin inhibitor dec-RVRR-cmk. hproPDGF-A and hproVEGF-C labeled at the C-terminus with a FLAG leading to their mature forms. the results were highly comparable with those of recombinant furin samples fresh as well as incubated in absence of Eda-peptide. it is interesting to note that neither inhibitors displayed any effect on the formation of 22 kDa intermediate form of PDGF-B. silver ions exhibited more intense 55 kDa furin band in the presence of higher concentration of furin-Eda-peptide (II). silver staining of fresh recombinant furin sample and samples after 24 h incubation in the absence and presence of various concentrations of furin-Eda-peptide. we postulate that the observed inhibition of furin activity by furin-Eda-peptide may be mediated by the cyclic (IIa) rather than the acyclic (II) form. further work using proton spectroscopy would be necessary to provide more convincing evidence for the above hypothesis. cyclized furin-Eda peptide (IIa) is shown in space filled structure in red. the furin P-domain (residue 487\u2013560) is depicted in stick mode and CPK (Corey, Pauling, Koltun) colors. this is the best fit docking structure obtained between the cyclic furin-Eda peptide (IIa) and any part of furin protein. addition of fluorinated alcohol such as TFE led to the formation of significant helical structure at the expense of its sheet structure. this observation suggested that TFE can promote helix structure in furin-Eda-peptide which might alter its furin inhibitory property. a 12-membered 1, 4-diaza enediyne heterocyclic ring compound with bis-benzyl substituent (AB-2) has been found to exhibit highest inhibitory activities against both furin and PC7 with IC50 of 8.5 and 10.5 M respectively. however it was found to be a less potent inhibitor towards PC5 with IC50 of 8.5 and 10.5 M respectively. the tetra aza compounds AB-6 and its Nickel-complex were found to be much poor inhibitors of furin. an enedynyl peptide can inhibit the protease activity of a PC enzyme such as furin. however, the inhibition of chymotrypsin by an enediynyl peptide was reported. furin-Eda peptide was introduced between P1/P1\u2032 amino acids. it is expected to lead to even more potent and/or selective inhibitor of furin. other peptides substrates of furin can be employed to validate this new hypothesis of ours for protease inhibitor design. the observed Ki and IC50 values for Eda-peptide were higher than that observed with bioengineered protein 1-Pdx [50] but were still in low nM range. our studies confirmed that Eda-peptide can block furin cleavage of fluorogenic peptides as well as physiologically relevant proteins proPDGF-A, B and proVEGF-C. proteolytic activation of these growth factor precursor proteins has been linked to tumor growth and progression. furin is characterized by the segment 548Val-Leu-Glu-Ile-Glu-Asn-Thr-Ser-Glu-Ala557. the complete catalytic domain of furin is defined as the sequence segment beginning at the mature N-terminus and ending at the residue equivalent to the C-terminus of thermitase. no other docking could be noticeable between the Eda-peptide (cyclic or acyclic form) and any domain of furin GF-B, Actin and FLAG tag were bought from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. all reagents for immuno-blotting and SDS-PAGE were purchased from Biorad Labs.
