{"summary": "transport of macromolecules across the nucleus requires a regulated energy-dependent process. the largest group of transport receptors have been designated karyopherins (3\u20136). the largest group of transport receptors have been designated karyopherins. hepatitis C virus (HCV) induces the cleavage of KPNB1 by NS3/4A to disrupt the IRF3 and NF-B translocation to inhibit IFN--stimulated signaling. PRRSV inhibits IFN-activated JAK/STAT signaling by blocking the nuclear translocation of STAT1/2 by binding to KPNA1 competitively. the +ssRNA viruses, including flavivirus, coronavirus, picornavirus, and arterivirus, cause severe human or animal diseases. PRRSV causes contagious disease that is characterized by reproductive failure in sows and respiratory disease of variable severity in pigs of all ages. KPNA6 knockdown in MARC-145 cells via RNA interference (RNAi) silencing inhibits the replication of PRRSV. restitution of KPNA6 expression in the KPNA6-knockout cells leads to the restoration of ZIKV replication. PRRSV infection induces elevation of the KPNA6 protein level. but there is minimal change in the KPNA2 level. the cells were infected with PRRSV strain VR-2385. the cells were harvested at 24 hpi for RNA isolation and RT-qPCR. the transcript level of KPNA6 remains stable in PRRSV-infected cells at 24 hpi. the elevation of KPNA6 protein level was not due to alteration at the transcriptional level. the increase in PRRSV-infected cells was not due to a change in its transcriptional level. we infected MARC-145 cells with PRRSV and treated the cells with cycloheximide at 24 hpi. negative wells were treated with DMSO and/or infected with PRRSV. the relative levels of KPNA6 are shown below the images. the KPNA6 polyubiquitination level was expected to be downregulated in PRRSV-infected cells. the result showed that the KPNA6 ubiquitination level in the PRRSV-infected cells was 10-fold lower than that of the mock-infected control. nsp12 protein upregulates the KPNA6 protein level in cells. PRRSV nsp12 induces KPNA6 elevation. no physical interaction between nsp12 and nsp12 was detected in the IP. nsp12, and tubulin were conducted to determine whether KPNA6 stabilized in the virus-infected cells could play a positive role in viral replication. a random shRNA was included as a negative control. a random shRNA was included as a negative control. PRRSV nsp1 relies on KPNA6 to translocate into the nucleus. some viral proteins, including nsp1, nsp1 and nucleocapsid protein (N), translocate into the nucleus during infection. the nsp1 protein has been known to restrain host mRNA in the nucleus to inhibit host protein synthesis. the cells were transfected with plasmids encoding HA-nsp1, HA-nsp1 and HA-nsp1. exogenous expression of KPNA6 restores its nuclear translocation. the results of confocal microscopy showed that restitution of KPNA6 restores the nuclear translocation of nsp1 completely. this result confirms that KPNA6 is required for nsp1 nuclear translocation. PRRSV replicates in the cytoplasm of infected cells. against KPNA6, ZIKV E protein, and GAPDH was conducted. RNA was isolated at 24 hpi, and RT-qPCR was conducted. the empty vector containing Cas9, but no target guide RNA (gRNA) was also used to establish stable Vero cells as controls. the KPNA6 knockout had no detectable negative effect on cell viability. PRRSV infection of MARC-145 cells led to a higher expression level of KPNA6, whereas the KPNA2 level remained unchanged. we infected the cells with two PRRSV strains, VR-2385 and VR-2332, at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. the cells were harvested at 24 h postinfection (hpi) the cells were infected with VR-2385 and VR-2332 at an MOI of 1, incubated for 24 h. the cells were harvested for WB with antibodies against KPNA6 and GAPDH, and pig anti-PRRSV serum. PRRSV infection increased KPNA6 levels by 1.7-, 2.2-, and 3.9-fold. almost all of the cells inoculated at MOIs of 1 and 10 were infected. the increase in the PRRSV RNA level in infected cells was positively correlated to the increase in the virus inoculum. PRRSV infection extends KPNA6 half-life. MARC-145 cells were infected with VR-2385 at an MOI of 1. cells were treated with cycloheximide at 24 hpi and harvested at the indicated time (h) for WB. the relative levels of Ub after normalization with KPNA6 are shown below the images. we hypothesized that treatment of cells with proteasome inhibitors, such as MG132, would block degradation of KPNA6. MG132-treated MARC-145 cells showed a higher level of KPNA6 than did mock-treated cells. PRRSV nsp12 protein upregulates the KPNA6 protein level in cells. we speculated that some PRRSV proteins were responsible for the elevation of KPNA6 in the virus-infected cells. HEK293 cells were harvested for WB at 36 h posttransfection. higher KPNA6 level in nsp12-stable HEK293 cells than in control. a viral titration assay showed that the KPNA6-silenced cells produced a significantly lower virus yield compared to control cells. the virus was harvested at 48 hpi for titration. we established KPNA6-knockout HeLa cells via the CRISPR/Cas9 system. the empty vector containing Cas9, but no target guide RNA (gRNA) was also used to establish stable HeLa cells as controls. the KPNA6 knockout had no detectable effect on the cell viability. the overlay images show HA-nsp1 and HA-nsp1 in red fluorescence, N-YFP in green fluorescence, and nuclear DNA staining with DAPI in blue. the cells were transfected with Myc-KPNA6 and HA-nsp1 plasmids. a karyopherin, is responsible for the nucleocytoplasmic transportation of cellular proteins. we used another +ssRNA virus, ZIKV, and determined the KPNA6 protein level. ZIKV also induced an elevation in the KPNA6 protein level compared to mock-infected cells. CTRL and KPNA6/ Vero cells were infected with ZIKV PRVABC59 strain. RNA was isolated at 24 hpi, and RT-qPCR was conducted. RNA was isolated at 24 hpi, and RT-qPCR was conducted. o cells with KPNA6 plasmid established stable cells for exogenous restitution of KPNA6 expression to exclude off-target effect of CRISPR/Cas9 system on ZIKV replication. we infected the cells with ZIKV PRVABC59 strain and harvested the cells at 24 hpi. KPNA6 is involved in the nuclear translocation of PRRSV nsp1 and ZIKV replication. exogenous restitution of KPNA6 expression in KPNA6-knockout cells restores the nuclear translocation of PRRSV nsp1 and ZIKV replication. both PRRSV and ZIKV led to the elevation of the KPNA6 protein level. the nsp1 protein induces the degradation of KPNA1 to block STAT1 nuclear translocation. nsp12 induces serine 727 phosphorylation of STAT1 to activate expression of inflammatory cytokines. inhibition of HSP70 negatively affects PRRSV replication. the expression of exogenous KPNA6 in KPNA6-knockout cells restores ZIKV replication, which substantiates the requirement of KPNA6 in the optimal viral proliferation. however, the restoration of nsp1 nuclear translocation in KPNA6-knockout HeLa cells with expression of exogenous KPNA6 is required for the viral replication. nsp1 subcellular location in PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells with KPNA6 silencing because we lacked antibody that detects nsp1 of VR-2385. on the other hand, our result does not exclude other potential mechanisms of KPNA6 to enhance viral replication. further studies to examine the mechanisms of KPNA6 in enhancing the replication of these +ssRNA viruses are warranted. the expression of exogenous KPNA6 in the KPNA6-knockout cells restores nsp1 nuclear translocation and ZIKV replication. these results suggest that KPNA6 is required for PRRSV and ZIKV. this finding provides new insights on virus-cell interactions.
