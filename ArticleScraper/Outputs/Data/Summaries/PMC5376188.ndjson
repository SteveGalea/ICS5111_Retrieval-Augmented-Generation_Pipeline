{"summary": "Ambra1 is a WD40 domain-containing protein involved in the development of the central nervous system, adult neurogenesis and vertebrate embryogenesis. when autophagy is not initiated, the Ambra1-Beclin1-Vps34 complex is bound to the dynein motor complex. when autophagy is not initiated, the Ambra1-Beclin1-Vps34 complex is bound to the dynein motor complex. ambra1 is a focal adhesion kinase (FAK)- and Src-binding partner. we therefore investigated the role of Ambra1 in tumour-associated phenotypes regulated by the Src/FAK pathway in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells derived from DMBA/TPA model of carcinogenesis. Ambra1 controls the targeting of active Src to intracellular autophagic puncta. this is mediated by the novel Ambra1-binding proteins Dynactin 1 (Dctn1; also known as p150Glued) and interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) which together with Ambra1, are critical to trafficking processes that control spatial Src activity. FAK or Ambra1 were immunoprecipitated from FAK-WT and FAK -/- cell lysates using (A) anti-FAK 4.47 agarose or (B) anti-Ambra1, followed by western blot analysis with anti-FAK and anti-Ambra1. anti-actin was used as a loading control. COSTES mean and s.d. values for Figure 1D\u2013F are shown. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23172.003 Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1. Knockdown of Ambra1 suppresses FAK phenotypes. cells were transiently transfected with either a pool or two independent Ambra1 siRNAs. the IPs were validated using FAK-deficient (-/-) SCC cells and Ambra1 -/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) in both FAK-WT and FAK -/- cells, Ambra1 showed diffuse cytoplasmic localisation with some at focal adhesions. however, the non-autophagy, non-adhesion cellular protein CoxIV was not found at isolated focal adhesions. Ambra1 binds to Src and is required for trafficking of active Src to autophagosomes. other FAK- and Src-interacting proteins are also involved in this spatial localisation of active Src. the localisation of Ambra1 in these autophagosomes was consistent with co-immunoprecipitation with LC3B. we note that there was a reduced steady state level of the lipidated form of LC3B (LC3B II) in the SCC FAK -/- cells. was immunoprecipitated from SCC FAK-WT and FAK -/- cell lysates using anti-LC3B. western blot analysis with anti-LC3B and ambra1/LC3B interactions was calculated by densitometry. nuclei from SCC FAK-WT and FAK -/- cells were isolated using sucrose gradient centrifugation. lysates were immunoblotted for Ambra1, GAPDH and Lamin A/C (nuclear marker) endogenous Ambra1 either by the pool of four siRNAs (Figure 2G,H) or two individual siRNAs (Figure 2I,J) resulted in the redistribution of active Src from intracellular puncta back to focal adhesions in FAK -/- cells. however, we were unable to determine whether this relocation would also occur in detached cells. anti-GAPDH served as loading control. western blot analysis with anti-IFITM3, anti-Ambra1, anti-FAK and anti-src Y416. IFITM3, which forms a central node linking the Ambra1, pSrc and FAK trafficking networks (Figure 3A), is known to block cellular entry of viruses (Amini-Bavil-Olyaee e. the interactions between IFITM3 and both Ambra1 and pSrc appeared to be enriched in FAK-expressing cells due to increased IFITM3 expression levels, caused by FAK-dependent IFITM3 transcription. we confirmed the interaction between ambra1 and IFITM3 (Figure 3C), FAK and IFITM3 (Figure 3D), and pSrc and IFITM3 (Figure 3E) by co-IPs. knockdown of IFITM3 did not affect the interaction between FAK and active pSrc. indicating that IFITM3 is involved in the optimal association of Src to FAK. this suggests that IFITM3 is a central component of a trafficking network. Knockdown of Dynactin 1 and IFITM3 suppresses trafficking of active Src to autophagic puncta. FAK-WT and FAK -/- cells transiently transfected with a pool of IFITM3 siRNAs and lysed 48 hr post transfection. eLife.23172.012 Figure 4\u2014source data 1. Percentage of cells with internalised pSrc. Mean percentage and s.d. values of cells with internalised pSrc upon transient Dctn1 (Figure 4C) or IFITM3 (Figure 4F) knockdown by siRNA in SCC FAK-WT and -/- cells. we knocked down Ambra1 and found that there was significant loss of polarisation towards a monolayer wound in FAK-expressing SCC cells. this was in contrast to FAK-deficient cells, in which knockdown of Ambra1 had no further effect on the already suppressed polarisation of cells towards a wound. the role of Ambra1 in polarisation was confirmed using Ambra1 +/+ and -/- MEFs. ambra1 binding impaired FAK increases cell adhesion and pSrc at focal adhesions. cells were plated in serum-free conditions on fibronectin-coated plates. relative intensity of pSrc staining at focal adhesions from five cells was measured using ImageJ. n = 5. Error bars, s.d. p0.01 (*) and p0.05 (#). mean and s.d. values of relative adhesion on fibronectin of SCC FAK-WT, P875A/P881A and -/- cells are shown. relative mean intensity and s.e.m. of pSrc at focal adhesions are shown. the average size of focal adhesions was measured using ImageJ. n = 3. Error bars, s.d. p0.01. there were no visible differences between total FAK or Ambra1 intensity staining. the relative ratio of Src/FAK interaction was calculated by densitometry. after 20 and 60 min, FAK P875A/P881A and FAK -/- cells seemed to display greater adherence than the FAK-WT cells. active pSrc and pFAK were elevated relative to total Src and FAK respectively. this was true also of pPaxillin Y118 (Figure 5G, right panels), reflecting specific retention of phospho- and activated- focal adhesion components at focal adhesions when FAK cannot bind to Ambra1. this implies that the FAK\u2013Ambra1 complex is crucial to orchestrate the selective removal of active focal adhesion components. influenced mis-regulation of active pSrc and pFAK levels at focal adhesions when FAK can no longer bind to Ambra1. increased active pSrc levels in the FAK P875A/P881A SCC cells were restored to normal (wildtype) levels by knocking down Dynactin 1 or IFITM3 expression. images were taken from 6\u201310 random fields and colonies were counted. n = 3. Error bars, s.d. p0.01 (*) and p0.05 (#). ambra1 interacts with FAK in SCCs and localises at focal adhesions. we found Ambra1 in a phage display screen for novel FAK binding partners. ambra1 regulates autophagy, and active Src was trafficked away from adhesions. Focal adhesions were isolated from FAK-WT and FAK -/- cells using hydrodynamic force. colocalisation (Costes r value from five cells) was analysed using the ImageJ plugin JaCoP. stained with anti-Ambra1 and anti-CoxIV (D) or anti-FAK and anti-CoxIV (E) in SCC FAK-WT and SCC FAK -/- cells. colocalisation (Costes r value from five cells) was analysed using imageJ plugin JaCoP. n = 3. Error bars, s.d. p0.01 (*) and p0.05 (#). n = 5. Error bars, s.e.m. p0.01 (*) and p0.05 (#). the non-autophagy, non-adhesion cellular protein CoxIV was not found at isolated focal adhesions, implying that the IF staining was not of general cellular debris. there was partial overlap with pSrc Y416 and FAK, suggesting that as with other autophagy proteins we have reported previously, there are pools of Ambra1 discretely present at sub-locations. ambra1 and Src, including active phospho-Src (pSrc; pY416), formed a biochemical complex in FAK-expressing and -deficient SCC cells. we found that Ambra1 localised to intracellular puncta that contain autophagy-regulating proteins like LC3B. cell lysates using anti-src agarose or anti-pSrc Y416 antibody. western blot analysis with anti-Ambra1, anti-pSrc Y416 and anti-Src. LC3B was immunoprecipitated from SCC FAK-WT and FAK -/- cell lysates. COSTES r values for immunofluorescence images and percentage of cells with internalised pSrc are shown. mean and s.d. values for Figures 2C and D are shown. cell lysates were subjected to western blot analysis using anti-Ambra1, anti-pSrc Y416 and anti-Src. anti-GAPDH was used as a loading control. IFITM3 is in the centre of an Ambra1, FAK and pSrc trafficking network. network analysis of ambra1-, FAK- and pSrc y416-interacting proteins. dotted lines indicate protein-protein interactions identified in the mass spectrometry datasets. siIFITM3 and pSrc Y416 (B) and FAK (D) were immunoprecipitated from FAK-WT and -/- cell lysates using anti-pSrc. western blot analysis with anti-Ambra1, anti-FAK, anti-IFITM3, anti-pSrc Y416 and anti-Src. IFITM3 is a central node linking the Ambra1, pSrc and FAK trafficking networks. it is known to block cellular entry of viruses. we confirmed the interaction between ambra1 and Dynactin 1 by co-IP. the interactions between IFITM3 and both Ambra1 and pSrc appeared to be enriched in FAK-expressing cells due to increased IFITM3 expression levels. we believe that IFITM3 is present at focal adhesions, shown by immunoblotting of isolated focal adhesion preparations. we knocked down IFITM3 using a pool of siRNAs and analysed the interaction of ambra1 and pSrc. suppression of protein expression resulted in significant redistribution of active pSrc from intracellular autophagic puncta to focal adhesions. knockdown of Dynactin 1 and IFITM3 suppresses trafficking of active Src to autophagic puncta. IFITM3 expression was determined by western blotting using anti-IFITM3. SCC FAK-WT and FAK -/- cells transiently transfected with a pool of IFITM3 siRNAs were grown on glass coverslips. the role of Ambra1 in polarisation was confirmed using Ambra1 +/+ and -/- MEFs. the role of Ambra1 in polarisation was confirmed using Ambra1 +/+ and -/- MEFs (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2C), while there was no effect in FAK-deficient cells. ambra1 binding impaired FAK increases cell adhesion and pSrc at focal adhesions. previously unknown role for ambra1 in cancer cell polarisation and invasion. SCC FAK-WT, FAK P875A/P881A and FAK -/- cells were plated in serum-free conditions on fibronectin-coated plates. relative adhesion was calculated by setting the FAK-WT values to 1. n = 3. Error bars, s.d. p0.01 (*) and p0.05 (#). the purity of isolated focal adhesions was determined by the absence of nuclear proteins like Lamin A/C and cytosolic markers like Hsp90 and GAPDH. there was less active Src at focal adhesions in the FAK-deficient SCC cells due to Src\u2019s internalisation to autophagic structures. SCC FAK-WT, FAK P875A/P881A and FAK -/- cells were plated in serum-free conditions on uncoated plates (plastic) samples were normalised to the 6 hr time point and relative adhesion was calculated by setting the FAK-WT values to 1. n = 3. Error bars, s.d. p0.001 (*) and p0.05 (#). TIRF microscopy of SCC FAK P875A/P881A cells stained with anti-Ambra1 and anti-FAK (C) or anti-ambra1 and anti-pSrc Y416 (D) colocalisation (COSTES r value of five cells) was analysed using the ImageJ plugin JaCoP. pSrc was present at intracellular autophagic puncta. there was more intense staining of active pSrc at focal adhesions. there were no significant changes in the number or size of focal adhesions. the increased staining of pSrc was confirmed by immunoblotting. isolated focal adhesion preparations. we examined chemotactic invasion into growth factor-reduced Matrigel and proliferation in three-dimensional (3D) culture. we found elevated active pSrc and pFAK at focal adhesions in FAK P875A/P881A cells was associated with enhanced invasive migration. increased proliferation in 3D compared to FAK-WT cells. ambra1 binding-impaired mutant FAK increases invasion and 3D proliferation. after 72 hr, invasion towards a serum gradient was visualised by staining cells with calcein. n = 6. Error bars, s.e.m. p0.01 (*) and p0.05 (#). n = 6. Mean values of invasion and number of colonies. mean number of colonies and s.d. are shown. Ambra1 is a novel spatial regulator of the active Src/FAK complex at sites of cell-matrix adhesion, controlling downstream biological effects in cancer cells. it does this by scaffolding trafficking proteins, for example, Dynactin 1 and IFITM3, which themselves lie at the heart of a network of scaffolding proteins. impaired FAK\u2013Ambra1 interaction results in increased active Src levels at focal adhesions. most likely this is due to perturbed trafficking of focal adhesion components. knockdown of proteins involved in trafficking processes rescues phenotypes in FAK P875A/P881A expressing SCC cells. central trafficking scaffold function of Ambra1 adds to number of important physiological functions for Ambra1. knockdown of Ambra1 caused reduced cancer cell polarisation towards the denuded area of a wounded monolayer. there was no effect in FAK-deficient cells, which display intrinsically low polarisation and invasion capacity. Dynactin 1 knockdown resulted in enlarged late endosomes. IFITM3 has been reported to localise to late endosomes/lysosomes. loss of IFITM3 blocks clathrin-mediated phagocytosis. FITM3 significantly impaired the trafficking of active Src to autophagic puncta. FITM3 interacts both with FAK and active Src, as well as Ambra1. this suggests that IFITM3 is involved in regulating FAK\u2019s interaction with Ambra1 and pSrc. these findings suggest that IFITM3 is involved in regulating FAK\u2019s interaction with Ambra1 and pSrc. ambra1-scaffolded proteins are involved in the dynamic regulation of active pSrc and pFAK, presumably by trafficking them to and from focal adhesions. we found that FAK-driven invasion in the SCC cells was hugely dependent on IFITM3, implying that its crucial role at the heart of trafficking protein networks linking Ambra1 and active Src is vital to Src/FAK-mediated invasion. Ambra1 is a novel spatial regulator of the active Src/FAK complex at sites of cell-matrix adhesion, controlling downstream biological effects in cancer cells. it acts as a \u2018spatial rheostat\u2019 to maintain steady-state levels of active pSrc and pFAK at adhesions. when FAK is present, Ambra1 forms a complex with FAK and Src. Ambra1 regulates the trafficking of active Src from focal adhesions to autophagosomes. this impaired FAK\u2013Ambra1 interaction results in increased active Src levels at focal adhesions. the role of Ambra1 in cancer is less clear. Ambra1 contributes to SCC cell behaviour by scaffolding both Src and FAK, and intracellular trafficking proteins. this scaffold protein promotes cancer cell phenotypes driven by the Src/FAK pathway, including cancer cell polarisation and chemotactic invasion. this central trafficking scaffold function of Ambra1 adds to the number of important physiological functions for Ambra1. ambra1 is localised to intracellular puncta containing the autophagosomal marker LC3B, and it interacts with LC3B. these data implicate Ambra1 in the selective autophagic trafficking of active Src when cancer cells are under severe \u2018adhesion stress\u2019. we found that ambra1-interacting proteins included the dynactin complex component Dynactin 1 and IFITM3, in addition to other proteins considered to be intracellular trafficking proteins IFITM3 has been reported to localise to late endosomes/lysosomes. overexpression expands Rab7- and LAMP1-positive structures. loss of IFITM3 blocks clathrin-mediated phagocytosis by removing clathrin from membranes. ambra1 binding-impaired mutant FAK protein caused increased steady-state levels of active pSrc and pFAK at focal adhesions. Enhanced invasion was reversed by knockdown of the ambra1-binding trafficking proteins Dynactin 1 and IFITM3. this mutant is also impaired in binding p130Cas, although to much lesser extent than Ambra1. ambra1 and its interacting partners control cancer cell adhesion, polarisation, proliferation in 3D and chemotactic invasion. deregulation of these trafficking components inhibits Src/FAK-dependent biological processes in cancer cells.
