{"summary": "new influenza virus A/H1N1 (2009) was isolated in 214 countries 1 year after first identification. a major issue was to estimate the transmissibility of the new virus. three parameters should be documented quickly in this respect. the serial interval (SI) is the time interval between the date of symptoms onset in one case and that in its infector. it is not an intrinsic property of the disease, but a combination of biology and behavior. cases may be observed in households, where common exposure may have led to coprimary cases and ongoing transmission to an overlap of secondary and tertiary cases. the serial interval (SI), i.e., the time interval between the date of symptoms onset in one case and that in its infector, is often considered instead of the GT because it has the same mean. 14 The GT or SI informs on the speed of transmission of the disease.
