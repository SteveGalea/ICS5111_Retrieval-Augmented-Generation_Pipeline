{"summary": "the models employed by epidemiologists can be subdivided into two [8] according to their assumptions regarding the stability of contacts. these models tend to assume that individuals form relatively stable partnerships (some, indeed, assume a static network) micro-simulation, or agent-based models, fall into the latter category of models in which individuals are assumed to form relatively stable contact networks. a lack of empirical base on which the models are based is problematic. results should allow a deeper understanding of the routes of transmission. results should help the investigation of outbreaks of close-contact pathogens. the questionnaire recorded details of participants' age, sex, and living and working arrangements. participants were asked to record the age and sex and a unique identifying code for each person they contacted during each study day. it was stressed that they should maintain the same code for each person. the statistical analysis was divided into two parts investigating (a) the number of contacts per day per individual and (b) the age difference between participants and contacts. for the first part of the analysis a two level regression model was fitted using sampling day as level 1 and participants as level 2. the absolute difference between the age of individual and the age of those contacted was taken as the response variable. the contacts were recoded during a two-week period during the spring term. participants were randomly assigned one weekday and both weekend days or alternatively, two randomly assigned weekdays and one randomly assigned weekend day. in practice, the final day of the survey was always a weekend. if the individual had contact with the same person more than once in a given day they were asked to record the contact only once in the context and place in which they had the most intimate contact. this is analogous to recording partnerships rather than sex acts for estimating the characteristics of sexual contact networks. the same process was repeated with place (home, college, travel, shop, social and other) instead of contact intensity. difference in age between primary and secondary cases was compared for clusters of measles and meningococcal disease [13] occurring over the period 1995\u20131998. the average number of contacts made by day of week and b) social context of contacts. individual and day of week, were random effects, sex, accommodation, # people in household, and weekday/weekend were modelled as fixed effects. the students in this study recorded approximately 0.7 Level 1 contacts (physical contact without conversation) per day. there was no evidence that, for this level of contact, they started to have repeat contacts with the same individuals over the study period. each Level 4 contact was contacted twice, on average, over the three days. 85% of contacts at Level 3 and 4 were with individuals within 2 years of age. only 62% of contacts at Level 1 and 2 were within 2 years of age. the intensity of contact was the only factor that remained significant in the model. the more intimate the contact, the more likely it was to occur at home, or in a \"social\" context. the more intimate the contact, the more likely it was to occur at home, or in a \"social\" context. patterns of infection we compared cluster data on the age of primary and secondary cases of measles and meningococcal disease in England and Wales. the data suggest a closer age-clustering of secondary cases for meningococcal disease than for measles. the mean absolute difference in age between primary and secondary cases of measles was 3 years. a number of limitations inherent to this study should be borne in mind. first, the exact nature of at-risk events is largely unknown. the contacts, as defined, probably do not represent actual at risk events, though they may share characteristics with them. the accuracy of diary-based reporting of contacts has been questioned [21,22], and a few students reported difficulties in remembering all their contacts. a comparison of self-reported diaries of telephone conversations with data from a digital exchange found that shorter conversations were less likely to be recorded. this was not the case in the Belgian study [20] the number of individuals contacted increased with the number of sampling opportunities for all levels of contact except the most intimate. there was no evidence that the rate of acquisition of Level 1 contacts slowed over the period of study, whereas the number of Level 4 contacts saturated almost immediately."}
