{"summary": "authors propose that the full-length spike (S) gene or the S1 portion of it is a suitable phylogenetic marker to reflect evolutionary relationships between emergent U.S. and Chinese strains of porcine epidemic diarrhea viruses. phylogenetic analysis based on the nucleotide sequences of the complete nucleocapsid gene is very useful for differentiating closely related PEDV strains (2, 3). phylogenetic analysis of the N gene nucleotide sequences revealed 2 major groups (G1 and G2). all U.S. strains and some Chinese strains in 2011 to 2012 were placed in the same subcluster with one early Chinese strain. we speculate that all U.S. PEDV strains probably have a Chinese origin. phylogenetic reconstructions may indicate that the genes should be given significant focus in the evaluation of the genetic diversity of PEDV strains emerging in the united states. the fact that all 10 U.S. PEDV strains arose from unpredictable recombinant events seems to have involved early and current Chinese PEDV variants."}
