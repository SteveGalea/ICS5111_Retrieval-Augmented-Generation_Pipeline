{"summary": "anantham and coworkers review the ethical framework that forms the basis of the professional obligations of physicians who respond to health care emergencies, such as an influenza pandemic. a reappraisal of the ethical basis of our professional duties as physicians should be an integral part of pandemic preparedness efforts, not only for professional organizations and health authorities, but also for individual physicians. sheer heroism will not solve the problems that will be encountered during a pandemic, because high-risk behaviours might further aggravate problems by rapidly diminishing the number of available physicians. physicians have the reciprocal right to demand sufficient institutional support (for example, protective equipment, chemoprophylaxis and, if available, vaccination). Competing interests The author declares that they have no competing interests."}
