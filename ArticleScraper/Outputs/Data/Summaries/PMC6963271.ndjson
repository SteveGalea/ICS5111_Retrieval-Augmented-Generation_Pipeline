{"summary": "human coronavirus was first detected in 2012 in a patient showing fever, shortness of breath, cough, and expectoration. since the first case, MERS-CoV spread rapidly around the world. 2428 human infections with MERS-CoV including 838 deaths were reported in four continents. influenza viruses (IVs) are classified antigenically based on the distinctions of the nucleoprotein (NP) into four genera: influenza-A viruses (IAV), influenza-B viruses (IBV), influenza-C viruses (ICV), and influenza-D viruses (IDV) both IAV and IBV contain eight segments, while ICV and IDV contain only seven segments. short immunogenic peptide 736CALPDTPSTLTPRSVRSVPGEMRLA761 from MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein was inserted into the stalk region of NA gene of influenza A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) (H1N1pdm09) virus using the designed primers. recombinant 5 + 3 rgH1N1 (Control virus), and chimeric bivalent 5 + 3 (candidate bivalent virus) chimeric rgH1N1-MERS-CoV virus (chimeric bivalent 5 + 3) had higher replication efficiency compared to parent wild type rgH1N1 virus (wT 5 + 3) in MDCK-II cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001. the chimeric bivalent 5 + 3 vaccine showed a significant increase in mean HAI titer reaching 6.5 and 8.2 log2 at weeks 6 and 8 respectively. the inactivated control group showed statistically significant increase in HAI titer at weeks 6 and 8 in comparison with control-PBS and MERS-CoV inactivated groups. the control-PBS and inactivated WT 5 + 3 groups showed no nAbs against MERS-CoV throughout the duration of experiment. the recombinant chimeric bivalent 5 + 3 virus and positive control inactivated WT 5 + 3 showed no body weight loss till 14 days pi when compared with the control group. mice were infected with 105.5 TCID50 dose of H1N1pdm2009 wild type virus intra-nasally. loss in body weight recorded up to two weeks post infection (wpi) and (B) survival percent at indicated time points (up to 2 wpi) mice were euthanized when they lost 30% of their original body weight. recombinant neuraminidase (NA) gene by insertion of short-peptide from MERS-CoV-Spike (red color) in NA stalk region of H1N1pdm2009 forming chimeric bivalent construct. chimeric virus had higher replication efficiency as measured by TCID50 at different time points. inactivated chimeric bivalent 5 + 3, WT 5 + 3, MERS-CoV vaccines, and 1 phosphate buffer saline (PBS) were injected with inactivated chimeric bivalent 5 + 3 and WT 5 + 3. at week 4, the hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titers waned after booster vaccination. the chimeric bivalent 5 + 3 vaccinated mice showed a significant increase (p value 0.001) of nAbs against MERS-CoV reaching 1:160 (7.3 log2) at week 8. the control-PBS and inactivated WT 5 + 3 groups showed no nAbs against MERS-CoV throughout the duration of experiment. all mice infected with H1N1pdm09 wild type in the control group had more than 30% decrease in weight from day 4 to 6 days pi. mortality rate in the control mice started at 4 days pi with 29% and increased gradually up to 85% at 5 days pi and 100% at 6 days pi. vaccination with either of the H1N1 viruses protected mice from influenza-induced mortality. based on the distinct natural deletion in the corresponding neuraminidase subtype (N1) of H5N1 isolates in Egypt since 2006 [16,17] for safety reasons, we preferred to test the NA of H1N1 instead of H5N1 as a shuttle for the MERS-CoV spike immunogenic epitope. the short immunogenic peptide was inserted in the stalk region of NA from H1N1pdm09. novel chimeric bivalent 5 + 3 vaccinated mice showed a significant increase of nAbs against the chimeric bivalent virus occurs at week 8. at week 4, an apparent decline in antibody levels of specific immune response was observed. this is likely related to a traditional phenomenon, namely self-limitation or resolution. the influenza H1N1pdm2009 virus was propagated in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK-II) cells. the MERS-CoV strain was grown in African green monkey kidney cells (Vero-E6) cells. 50 L: 25 L master mix, 3 L each forward and reverse primers for each fragment, ddH2O 18 L and template DNA (pHW-NAH1pdm09) 1 L were mixed. cycler conditions were 95 \u00b0C for 1 min followed by three steps. rgH1N1pdm09 (WT 5 + 3), rgH1N1-MERS-CoV (chimeric bivalent 5 + 3) viruses were generated using (pHW-PB2PR8, pHW-PB1H1N1pdm09, pHW-PAPR8, pHW-HAH1N1pdm09, pHW-NPPR8, pHW-NAH1N1pdm09, pHW-MPR8, and pH Opti-MEM containing 1% antibiotic-antimycotic mixture was replaced with 1 mL Opti-MEM containing 1% antibiotic-antimycotic mixture and 0.4% bovine serum albumin. cells were incubated overnight at 37 \u00b0C,5 % CO2. supernatants were harvested and clarified by low-speed centrifugation. the supernatant of infected cells was harvested at specific time points. the novel rescued virus chimeric bivalent 5 + 3 and WT 5 + 3 were propagated in 10-day-old SPF embryonated chicken eggs. sera were collected at 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 wpv. the collected sera were tested for antibodies against H1N1pdm09 and MERS-CoV. influenza A virus wild type A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) was administered intranasally with infectious dose 105.5 TCID50 to all immunized and control PBS groups. mice showing a weight loss more than 30% of the initial body weight were euthanized and documented as dead. the influenza H1N1pdm2009 virus was propagated in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK-II) cells. the MERS-CoV strain was grown in African green monkey kidney cells (Vero-E6) cells. L and template DNA (pHW-NAH1pdm09) 1 L were mixed. cycler conditions were 95 \u00b0C for 1 min followed by three steps. bands were purified using QIAquick gel purification kit. rgH1N1-MERS-CoV (chimeric bivalent 5 + 3) viruses were generated using (pHW-PB2PR8, pHW-PB1H1N1pdm09, pHW-PAPR8, pHW-HAH1N1pdm09, pHW-NPPR8, and pHW-NSPR8) on the day of transfection, 293T/MDCK-II cells were co-cultured in a ratio of 3/1 then incuba supernatants were harvested and clarified by low-speed centrifugation. we injected the supernatant into the 10-day-old specific-pathogen-free embryonated chicken eggs and MDCK-II cells. recombinant viruses were harvested and propagated in SPF embryonated chicken eggs for three passages. the novel rescued virus chimeric bivalent 5 + 3 and WT 5 + 3 were propagated in 10-day-old SPF embryonated chicken eggs. harvested viruses were inactivated using 0.1% formaldehyde and mixed well for 24 h at 4 \u00b0C. pellets were suspended in 500 L 1 PBS and virus titers were measured by HA assay. the collected sera were tested for antibodies against H1N1pdm09 and MERS-CoV viruses using HAI [31] and PRNT50 in vero-E6 cells. 4.7. Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT) PRNT assay was performed. influenza A virus wild type A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) was administered intranasally with infectious dose 105.5 TCID50 to all immunized and control PBS groups. mice showing a weight loss more than 30% of the initial body weight were euthanized and documented as dead."}
