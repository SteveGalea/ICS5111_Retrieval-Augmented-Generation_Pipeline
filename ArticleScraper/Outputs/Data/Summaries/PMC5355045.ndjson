{"summary": "MERS-CoV is a betacoronavirus infecting humans. it is similar to HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E. infection is associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome. candidate vaccines currently being developed include spike (S) protein nanoparticles [10], modified vaccinia virus vectors [11] and immunogens based on the full-length S DNA and subunit protein S1 [12] all of which have been shown to be able to induce neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV. the titer of recombinant baculovirus stocks at the third passage was determined to be 3.7107 infectious units (IFU)/ml. infection of Sf9 cells with recombinant baculovirus yielded MERS-CoV VLPs, which were purified with a discontinuous sucrose gradient. each composition of the MERS-CoV VLPs was confirmed by Western blot. bands corresponding to S, M and E in MERS-CoV VLPs were observed. cells were infected with recombinant baculoviruses in A, C, E. mouse anti-M polyclonal antibody (lane 1 lysate from pFastBacDual infected cells served as a control; lane 2 MERS-CoV VLPs) and C. mouse anti-E polyclonal antibody (lane 1 lysate from pFastBacDual infected cells served as control; lane 2 MERS-CoV VLPs) a. Rhesus macaques (n=3) were vaccinated IM with 250 g of MERS-CoV VLPs. one group was treated with equivalent volumes of PBS as a control (n=3) blood samples were collected from the femoral vein of monkeys before immunization. PBMCs secreting A. IFN- or B. IL-4 were quantitated using ELISpot assays. results show that the PBMCs of VLP-vaccinated NHPs had significantly higher release of IFN- upon stimulation with purified RBD antigen. the recombinant baculovirus was expressed in Sf9 cells. morphology of the recombinant baculovirus was investigated by electron microscopy. cells were detected with anti-S polyclonal sera in A and B, anti-M polyclonal sera in C and D, and anti-E polyclonal sera in E and F respectively. TEM and IEM analysis of MERS-CoV VLPs. pcDNA3.1-MERS-S transfected BSR cell lysates were compared with purified MERS-CoV VLPs. lysate from uninfected BSR cells served as controls. Western blot analysis of spike glycoprotein expression in insect and mammalian cells. sus macaques (n=3) were vaccinated IM with 250 g of MERS-CoV VLPs. one group was treated with equivalent volumes of PBS as a control (n=3) blood samples were collected from the femoral vein of monkeys before immunization. serum IgG titers were determined as the highest serum dilutions that completely prevent CPE in at least 50% of the wells. s. PBMCs secreted A. IFN- or B. IL-4 with the purified RBD. the data represent the mean +/- standard deviation (SD) of SFCs per million. DISCUSSION VLP production via the baculovirus expression platform in insect cells is a tried and tested strategy for vaccine development. study co-infection of the MERS-CoV S and M recombinant baculoviruses in insect cells did not result in VLP formation. instead, we demonstrated that VLPs consisting of three structural envelope proteins (S, E, M) can be generated in insect cells with similar morphology to MERS-CoV virions. the expression of S protein from insect cells was slightly larger than that from mammalian cells, suggesting that the glycosylation of our V Vaccination with MERS-CoV VLPs also resulted in T-cell responses to RBD. IFN-, but not IL-4 secretion was detected from PBMCs, suggesting that VLPs elicited a Th1-mediated response. future experiments should involve efficacy testing in rhesus macaques, transgenic mice overexpressing DPP4. promoter and the M gene were inserted into the SalI and NotI sites. plasmid was examined by restriction enzyme analysis to confirm correct orientation of the insertions. recombinant bacmids were authenticated using pUC/M13 forward and Reverse primers. indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) Immunofluorescence assay performed as previously described. Briefly, Sf9 cells were infected with the recombinant baculovirus for 48 h. then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes at room temperature. cells were incubated with primary antibodies that contained 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. cDNA3.1-MERS-S and cells were lysed 3 days later. immunoization studies Six rhesus macaques were randomized into two groups. one group was vaccinated intramuscularly in the gastrocnemius muscle. 100 L of the substrate 3, 3\u2032, 3, 5\u2032-tetramethylvenzidine (TMB) was added to each well, incubated for 30 min, and then stopped with 50 L of 2 M H2SO4. cells were observed daily for cytopathic effect (CPE) purified antigen was added at a final concentration of 10 g/ml to stimulate cytokine production. the rest of the assay was carried out according to manufacturer instructions. the environment and housing facilities for rhesus macaques is in accordance with the National Standards of Laboratory Animal Requirements of China. plasmid pFastBacDual-SEM was examined by restriction enzyme analysis. recombinant bacmids were authenticated by PCR using pUC/M13 forward and Reverse primers. supernatant containing recombinant baculovirus was harvested 5 days after transfection as the viral stock. Sf9 cells were infected with the recombinant baculovirus for 48 h. then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes at room temperature. cells were incubated with primary antibodies that contained 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. six rhesus macaques were randomized into two groups. one group was vaccinated intramuscularly (IM) with 250 g of MERS-CoV VLPs. the other group was given an equivalent volume of PBS as a control. 100 L of the substrate 3, 3\u2032, 3, 5\u2032-tetramethylvenzidine (TMB) was added to each well, incubated for 30 min, and then stopped with 50 L of 2 M H2SO4. cells were observed daily for cytopathic effect (CPE) at a final concentration of 10 g/ml, the rest of the assay was carried out according to manufacturer instructions. the environment and housing facilities for rhesus macaques is in accordance with the National Standards of Laboratory Animal Requirements of China."}
