{"summary": "the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is a highly contagious disease in animals. the virus belongs to the Aphthovirus genus of the Picornaviridae family. it has a single-stranded, plus-sense RNA genome that consists of 8,500 bases. the influenza A virus (IAV) M2 protein was the first protein to be studied as an ion channel. many viral proteins, including the hepatitis C virus (Vpu) p7protein, the classical swine fever virus (CSFV) p7protein, and the togavirus 6K protein, have been identified as members of the viroporin family. cornaviruses may play the same role in virus infection. plasmids included pSUMO-2B, pEGFPN1-2B, pCS2-2B, pXJ-FLAG-2B with a FLAG epitope tag. all of the plasmids were verified using standard sequencing techniques. the cDNA of human microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3B (LC3, NCBI RefSeq NM_022818.4) was amplified from cDNA of H1299 cells using the primers 5\u2019-CCGGAATTCCATGCCGTCGGAGAAGAC-3\u2019 and 5\u2019-CGGGGTACCAACAATTCTAGTGCA-3\u2019. the nucleus was stained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Beyotime, Jiangsu, China,0.5 g/mL) the cells were observed under a laser-scanning confocal microscope at the wavelengths 340nm, 488nm, and 561nm. positive bacterial clones were cultured overnight in TB medium with 10 g/mL kanamycin at 37\u00b0C. when the OD600 reached 0.6\u20130.7, 1 mM isopropyl--d-thiogalactoside (IPTG) was added. pXJ-FLAG-2B and pXJ-2B-HA were transfected into BHK-21 cells simultaneously or alone. at 12 hours post-transfection, the cells were collected for co-immunoprecipitation. the cells were stained with propidium iodide (PI) and Fluo-3 AM. fluorescence was detected using a LSCM at the wavelengths 340 nm, 488 nm, and 561 nm. the H1299 cell line, which expresses GFP-LC3, was transfected with the pCS2-2B plasmid. cells that were not treated or were transfected with pCS2 were used as a negative control. plasmid and the stable transfectants were selected by Western blot. fluorescent signals were detected by inverted fluorescence microscope. all of the cell lines were maintained in modified Eagle\u2019s medium. plasmid pEGFPN1 and recombinant plasmid pEGFPN1-2B were transfected into BHK-21 cells using Lipofectamine 2000. at 12 hours post-transfection, both dishes of cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) plasmids pXJ-FLAG-2B, pXJ-2B-HA, and pXJ-2B(amino acids 110\u2013111) were transfected into BHK-21 cells usingLipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen, California, USA) at 12 hours post-transfection, all of the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 15 minutes and washed with PBS 3 times. a western blot analysis was performed to assess the expression level of the 2B protein. the 2B protein was expressed and purified after transformation of the pSUMO-2B plasmid into the Escherichia coli C43(DE3)pLysS strain. the cells were stained with propidium iodide (PI) and Fluo-3 AM. the samples were analyzed using flow cytometry at the wavelengths 561 nm and 535 nm. the cells in each group were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. at 12 hours post-transfection, the cells in each group were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. the fluorescence was detected using a LSCM at the wavelengths 340 nm, 488 nm, and 561 nm. the sequences labeled in red represent the two transmembrane domains predicted by the online software. the 2B proteins of poliovirus and coxsackie virus are located in the ER or the Golgi apparatus. further studies have revealed that most viroporins are located intracellularly[3] the blue fluorescence represents the nucleus, the green fluorescence represents the GFP protein or GFP-2B protein, and the red fluorescence represents the ER. plasmids were constructed to confirm the topology of the FMDV 2B protein in BHK-21cells. the antibodies could not penetrate the ER membrane after treatment with 0.01 mg/mL digitonin to detect the FLAG tag between the two transmembrane domains. this finding also revealed that the FLAG tag inserted between the two transmembrane domains was located inside the ER membrane with a lumen orientation. the FMDV 2B protein may be a member of class IIB viroporins according to its transmembrane topology. Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS and C43(DE3)pLysS, were used to express the 2B protein as a control. the strain can improve the stability of plasmids during the expression of toxic recombinant proteins. however, there was no significant difference between pSUMO-2B(BL21) and pSUMO-2B(C43) the pSUMO and pSUMO-2B plasmids were transfected into the Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS or C43(DE3)pLysS strain. the OD600 was determined at 0h, 1h, 2h, 3h, 4h and 5h post-induction. effect of amantadine on the release of FMDV is an effective inhibitor of viroporins, including the IAV M2 protein [27, 28], the HCV p7 protein [29] and the C-terminal subunit of the p13 protein (p13-C) of GB virus B (GBV-B) the 2B proteins of poliovirus and coxsackie virus also demonstrate pore-forming activity. oligomerization of the 2B protein was detected by Western blot analysis using a cross-linking agent. a co-immunoprecipitation assay was performed to study the self-interactions of the 2B protein. BHK-21 cells were transfected with the pXJ-FLAG-2B and pXJ-2B-HA plasmids simultaneously or alone. this result suggests that the 2B protein monomers interacted with each other after expression in BHK-21 cells. the effects of the 2B protein on the Ca2+ content and membrane integrity in host cells. untreated BHK-21 cells (A) and cells transfected with pXJ-2B-HA (B) were stained with Fluo-3 AM and propidium iodide (PI) at 12 hours post-transfection. this increase was associated with a change in the PI in BHK-21 cells. the cells were collected at 12 hours post-transfection for fluorescence observation using a LSCM. a low level of LC3 puncta formation was present in both the untreated cells and the cells transfected with pXJ-2B-HA. significantly more LC3 puncta (238, p = 0.000, p0.01) were found in the cells transfected with pCS2-2B. this was similar to the results observed in the positive control (263, p = 0.000, p0.01). this suggests that the 2B protein activates autophagy induction in BHK-21 cells. a schematic representation of the FMDV proteins and a multiple alignment of the 2B protein among FMDV serotypes. one isolate of each serotype was listed in the alignment. the sequences labeled in red represent the two transmembrane domains predicted by the online software. the FMDV 2B protein was located in the ER of cells that overexpressed the protein. the blue fluorescence represents the nucleus, the green fluorescence represents the GFP protein or GFP-2B protein, and the red fluorescence represents the ER. pXJ-FLAG-2B, pXJ-2B-HA, or pXJ-2B-HA were transfected with digitonin. this finding suggests that the antibodies could not penetrate the ER membrane after treatment with 0.01 mg/mL digitonin to detect the FLAG tag between the two transmembrane domains. this finding also revealed that the FLAG tag inserted between the two transmembrane domains was located inside the ER membrane with two bacterial strains, BL21(DE3)pLysS and C43(DE3)pLysS, were used to express the 2B protein as a control. a dramatic decrease in cell density occurred in the BL21(DE3)pLysS cells that expressed the 2B protein. however, the density of the C43(DE3)pLysS cells continued to increase. the pSUMO and pSUMO-2B plasmids were transfected into the Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS or C43(DE3)pLysS strain. the products were analyzed by Western blot analysis with an anti-His antibody. lysed BL21(DE3)pLysS cells expressed the 2B protein at 2 hours post-induction. however, no specific band was detected in the lysed BL21(DE3)pLysS cells. results suggest the 2B protein is toxic to BL21(DE3)pLysS cells. oligomerization of FMDV 2B protein monomers Pore-forming activity is an important property of viroporins. the monomers of viroporins, such as the IAV M2 protein [32], the HCV p7 protein [33] and the CSFV p7 protein [16], can oligomerize to form pores. the 2B proteins of poliovirus and coxsackie virus also demonstrate pore-forming activity. the monomers and oligomers of the 2B protein were detected by immunoblot analysis with an anti-His monoclonal antibody. the cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-His monoclonal antibody. a co-immunoprecipitation assay was performed to study the self-interaction of the 2B protein. intensity in the Q1 quadrant increased from 0.2% (Fig 7A) to 32.5% (Fig 7B) fluorescence intensity in the Q4 quadrant increased from 0.1% (Fig 7A) to 5.2% (Fig 7B) results suggest host 2B protein expression disrupts membrane integrity. LC3-I and LC3-II levels were determined by Western blot analysis. cells that were not treated or transfected with the pXJ vector were used as a negative control. a low level of LC3 puncta formation was present in both the untreated cells and the cells transfected with pCS2 (47), indicating a basal level of autophagy induction in the negative control. however, significantly more LC3 puncta (238, p = 0.000, p0.01) were found in the cells transfected with pCS2-2B (Fig 8D) viroporins can form hydrophilic pores in biological membranes. also disturb cellular Ca2+ homeostasis, induce autophagy, and cause apoptosis. few studies have been conducted on the 2B protein of FMDV. this protein exhibited a transmembrane topology similar to that of class IIB viroporins. this protein shares characteristics with class IIB viroporins. but a definitive identification of the domains and function of the two transmembrane regions requires further study. we speculated that amantadine abolished the pore-forming activity of the 2B protein. in the previous experiment, 2B protein was detected at 2\u20132.5 h post-infection. however, no 2B protein expression was detected at different times post-transfection. this difference may due to cell toxicity. d Ca2+ levels may have contributed to the increase in autophagy. an increased Ca2+concentration first activates Ca2+/calmodulin dependency kinase kinase beta (CaMKK-), an upstream regulator of AMPK. then, CaMKK- induces AMPK phosphorylation, and autophagy occurs."}
