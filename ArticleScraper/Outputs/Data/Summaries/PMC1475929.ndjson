{"summary": "green tea is produced from the shrub Camellia sinensis. leaves are dried but not fermented so that the green coloration attributed to polyphenols is retained. commercially prepared green tea extracts contain 60% polyphenols. EGCG is reportedly the most potent catechin inhibitor of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (21) but only EGC is a potent mediator of oxidative modification and an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase during hepatic catabolism of purines (24). we hypothesized that the in vitro anticancer action of the various catechins varies with the type and stage of malignancy. the DU145 metastatic caP cell line was derived from a brain lesion of 69-year-old male Caucasian. it is androgen insensitive and does not express prostate-specific antigen. all four cell lines were cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen freezer at 70\u00b0C. mM sodium chloride, 5.4 mM potassium chloride, 5.6 mM dextrose, 0.54 mM ethylene diamine tetra acetate (EDTA), 7.1 mM sodium bicarbonate (HH639) recovered with cold RPMI-1640-9% FBS. cell viability and cell count were reassessed before cells were seeded in culture flasks. 10 ml of the RPMI-1640-FBS solution described above were transferred to each flask and allowed to grow until control cells reached confluency. cells were detached with sterile EDTA-dextrose at 37\u00b0C for 5 min, recovered with cold RPMI-1640-FBS medium and resuspended in the same medium. HH450 was from moderately differentiated metastatic cells recovered from the abdominal fluid of a 56-year-old Caucasian female. all four cell lines were cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen freezer at 70\u00b0C. the vials were transferred to a 37\u00b0C water bath for 15\u201330 s, further thawed at room temperature and then transferred to a 15 ml polypropylene tube with a Pasteur pipette. tea Epicatechins All epicatechins used in this study were obtained from Sigma (EC, Sigma E4018; FW 290.3; ECG, Sigma E3892, FW 442.4; EGC, Sigma E3768, FW 306.3; EGC, Sigma E3768, FW 306.3; EGC, Sigma E4143, FW 458.4) the interval between seeding and confluent growth of control cells was used to calculate the doubling time and the number of cell cycles. the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of each catechin in each cell line was calculated using a software program (Microcal Origin Corp, OriginLab Corporation, Northampton, MA) both ECG and EGCG significantly affected the density of each cell line. decrease in cell density was observed at higher concentrations of ECG and EGCG. the mean density or viable cell number (in millions) was examined with or without catechins (50 M) untreated cells from each line reached confluency in about 2.5 cell cycles. EC did not affect proliferation of DU145, HH870 or HH450 cells. EGCG arrested proliferation of all four lines. 54 106 1.19 106 0.76 106 Fold increase (approx.) >2 >2 1 >2 >1 Number of cell cycles 2.5 2 1 2 1.5 Dead cell count 0.22 106 0.12 106 0.1 106 0.2 106 0.16 106 Mean doubling time 76 h 82 h 195 h 83 h 147 h Metastatic prostate cancer (DU145), 125 h* for confluent growth of untreated cells Number of flasks 5 5 h 82 h 130 h 83 h 106 h Epithelial ovarian cancer (HH639), 170 h for confluent growth of untreated cells Number of flasks 5 5 5 5 Initial seeding 0.25 106 0.25 106 0.25 106 0.25 106 106 Cell number 2.1 106 0.90 106 0.20 106* 1.83 106 1.10 106 Fold increase (approx.) 3 3 0 3 2 Number of cell EGCG suppressed growth at all higher concentrations tested. EGCG significantly enhanced proliferation of CaP cells at 25 M. cell counts for HH870 and DU145 were significantly higher than control values. organ-confined prostate cancer cell line HH870 and primary and metastatic epithelial ovarian cancer cell lines (HH450 and HH639) seeded (2.5 105 cells per line) in flasks with or without various concentrations. both ECG and EGCG significantly affected the density of each cell line at or above 75 M. ECG decreased the cell density of prostate cancer cells DU145, HH870 and ovarian cancer cell line HH639 more potently than EGCG. but EGCG inhibited the growth of ovarian cancer cell line HH450 better than ECG, suggesting the need to determine relative efficacy of ECG and EGCG. cells from each flask were harvested and viable/dead cells were counted. the mean doubling time was calculated from the mean of five viable cell counts. the mean doubling time was calculated from the mean of five viable cells. 106 0.25 106 0.25 106 Cell number 1.56 106 1.11 106 0.64 106 1.31 106 0.74 106 Fold increase (approx.) >2 2 >1 >2 >1 Number of cell cycles 2.5 2 1.3 2.4 1.6 Dead cell count 0.45 106 0.3 106 0.24 106 0.34 106 0 Mean doubling time 51 h 60 h 96 h 53 h 81 h Epithelial ovarian cancer (HH450 IC50 of ECG is Superior to EGCG Proliferation of each cell line (n = 3 per treatment) was monitored with or without ECG or EGCG at concentrations of 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 M. the suppressive effect on cell density was striking at higher concentrations of ECG and EGCG. the suppressive effect on cell density was striking at higher concentrations of ECG and EGCG. at 25 M of EGCG, cell counts for HH870 and DU145 were significantly higher than control values. the suppressive effect on cell density was striking at higher concentrations of ECG and EGCG. EGCG was not always the most potent chemopreventive agent. EC, EGC, ECG, EGCG, GC and C were tested against MCF-7 breast carcinoma cell line. EGCG inhibited Erk-1 and Erk-2 activation in serum-deprived HT-29 human colon cancer cells in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. EGCG inhibited tumor growth (58%), microvessel density (30%), tumor cell proliferation (27%) and increased tumor cell apoptosis (1.9-fold) relative to the control condition. scavenging activity was evaluated using the DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) radical. scavenging activity was less than that of the galloyl moiety Melanoma UACC-375 EGCG Valcic et al. tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-1 (PLC-1) and phosphatidylinositol 3\u2032-kinase (PI3\u2032-K) was also inhibited. EC did not show significant growth inhibition by EGCG. both EGCG and genistein inhibited the promoter activity of hnRNP A2/B1 gene expression. IC50 values were 29 mM for EGCG and 66 mM for genistein. the effects of EGCG and EGCG on the growth of human pancreatic adenocarcinoma were determined. the galloylated catechins showed a stronger effect than non-galloylated catechins. co-treatment with EGCG, EC, ECG and the tea catechins may have a role to play in modulating oxidative stress in lead-exposed HepG2 cells. EGCG, EGC and theaflavin suppressed invasion without cytotoxicity against cancer cells and HUVECs. EC, theaflavin, tea flavonols, tea flavonols and gallate derivatives showed a weak invasion inhibitory effect. ECG inhibited invasion in the absence of CTX Stomach KATO III ECG Okabe et al. EGCG inhibited TNF- gene expression in KATO III cells. EGCG prevents proliferation of DU145 cells by arresting the cell cycle at G0/G1-phase. most of the literature indicates that EGCG is the most potent growth inhibitor of cell lines from glioblastoma, melanoma and cancers of the breast, colon, lung, prostate (androgen-receptor-positive), pancreas, liver and mouth. in vitro dose of 100 M is equivalent to 29 mg (EC/EGC) to 45 mg (EGCG/ECG) in one cup of green tea. plasma levels of EGCG and EGC in healthy volunteers increased to 78 and 223 ng ml1 respectively, 20 min after drinking brewed green tea. cancer."}
