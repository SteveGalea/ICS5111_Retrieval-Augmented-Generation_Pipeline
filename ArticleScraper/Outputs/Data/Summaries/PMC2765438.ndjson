{"summary": "viral peptides within infected cells are presented to T-lymphocytes by the polymorphic human leukocyte antigens (HLA) the pattern of ongoing immune escape and reversion associated with several human HLA alleles has been studied extensively. however, there has been little attempt to study permanent loss of CTL epitopes due to escape mutations without an effect on fitness. human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) originated from simian immunodeficiency virus infecting chimpanzees (SIVcpz) through a chimpanzee-to-human zoonotic transmission [1-4] the natural hosts of the virus, the chimpanzee, have been thought to remain asymptomatic throughout infection despite high viral loads. the immune response is mediated by HLA molecules that bind to endogenous antigenic peptides known as epitopes. each HLA molecule binds to peptides that contain specific sequence motif patterns. for binding to occur between a peptide and the HLA binding groove, only limited amino acid variation at the main anchor positions of the peptide is allowed. a branch of the SIV-HIV-1 phylogenetic tree leading to the ancestor of the HIV-1 sequences would include evidence of episodic selection to escape from common human immune responses. we predicted epitopes for HLA alleles using the SIV consensus sequence to approximate the sequence that was transmitted to humans. phylogenetic tree of the 32 HIV-1 group M reference genome sequences and 9 SIVcpz sequences from the Los Alamos sequence database. chimpanzee sequence names start with 'CPZ' and group M sequences start with the subtype name. the branch lengths are scaled in reference to the scale given at the top of the tree. the better the peptide binds to the HLA binding groove, the higher the binding affinity. 80% of top 15 percentile best binders were known optimal HLA binding peptides [36]. for each available HLA allele, we first selected peptide regions that had binding scores in the best 5%. the branchAPriori analysis compared selective pressure along the HIV ancestral branch to the rest of the branches in the tree using the BranchAPriori algotithm. the program outputs a p-value derived from the difference in the log likelihood between the null and the alternative models. the null model assumes a single global dN/dS ratio () across the tree; in the alternative model, is allowed to have a different value for the HIV ancestral branch. the model with the best fit to the data is selected. each branch is assigned to a dN/dS rate class. the percentage of models that support dN>dS are written above each branch. the resulting alignment consisted of 9 chimpanzee sequences and 32 HIV-1 sequences starting from codon 1 of the gag gene and ending with the nef stop codon. the resulting alignment consisted of 9 chimpanzee sequences and 32 HIV-1 sequences starting from codon 1 of the gag gene and ending with the nef stop codon. the lower the score, the better the peptide binds to the HLA binding groove, the higher the binding affinity. 80% of top 15 percentile best binders were known optimal HLA binding peptides [36] for each available HLA allele. the BranchAPriori analysis compared the selective pressure along the HIV ancestral branch to the rest of the branches in the tree using the BranchAPriori algotithm. the program outputs a p-value derived from the difference in the log likelihood between the null and the alternative models. a priori analysis has the disadvantage of assuming that all the branches in the rest of the tree are under uniform selective pressure. model that assumes uniform selection across all branches of the tree. an Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) value is calculated for each model. each branch is assigned to a dN/dS rate class. the program outputs a p-value derived from the difference in the log likelihood between the null and the alternative models. the null model assumes a single global dN/dS ratio () across the tree; in the alternative model, is allowed to have a different value for the HIV ancestral branch. the analysis has the disadvantage of assuming that all the branches in the rest of the tree are under uniform selective pressure. GABranch provides the proportion of tested models that show support for dN > dS for each branch. Figure 2. Branch-by-branch selective pressure for regions predicted to be targeted by HLA-A*0201. in africa population A*0201 16% A*6801 10% B*2705 1% B*3501 5% B*5301 5% B8 5% HLA alleles with solved crystal structures that are available for analysis in the PREDEP program. allele frequencies were estimated in [42] for sites associated with B*2705. branchApriori values for the HIV ancestral branch and the rest of the tree Allele HIV ancestral branch Rest of the tree p-value A*0201 2.5 1.2 0.08 A*6801 3.5 1.6 0.04 B*2705 1.0 1.1 0.65 Branch-by-branch analysis using the GABranch algorithm. the rate categories for the best fitting model as well as the number of branches assigned to each rate category are given in Table 4. dN>dS is the fraction of models that show support for dN>dS. positive selective pressure was inferred along the HIV ancestral branch. the best fitting model for the HLA B*2705 predicted binding sites had only a single rate class. the best binders for each HLA molecule across the chimp genome are given in Table 2. the best binders for each HLA molecule are given in Table 2. the best binders for each HLA molecule across the chimp genome are given in Table 2. branchApriori values for the HIV ancestral branch and the rest of the tree Allele HIV ancestral branch Rest of the tree p-value A*0201 2.5 1.2 0.08 A*6801 3.5 1.6 0.04 B*2705 1.0 1.1 0.65 Branch-by-branch analysis of selective pressure using the GABranch algorithm. dN>dS is the fraction of models that show support for dN>dS. positive selective pressure was inferred along the HIV ancestral branch. the best fitting model for the HLA B*2705 predicted binding sites had only a single rate class under weak purifying selection. we only observed HLAs A*0201, A*6801 and B*2705 to bind strongly to some regions of the consensus SIVcpz genome. neither the a priori nor the GABranch analysis found evidence for positive selection in the HLA B*2705 alignment. delayed progression is a result of reduced viral replication - this indicates that these sites are important for the fitness of the virus. immune escape mutations that occurred for HLA A*0201 mediated CTL responses may have been selected for in the period immediately following zoonosis. if these adaptations subsequently became fixed in the viral population they would no longer be under diversifying selection today. we determined the average extent of selective pressure exerted by each HLA allele along the branch leading to HIV-1 sequences. this branch represents the sequences that first encountered human immune response-directed selective pressure immediately following the zoonosis event. this branch represents the sequences that first encountered human immune response-directed selective pressure immediately following the zoonosis event. no conserved synonymous sites were found along the vif gene region. branches with high model-averaged support for dN>dS are shown in bold."}
