{"summary": "measles is a small spherical, enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the genus Morbillivirus in the family Paramyxoviridae. despite the availability of an effective vaccine for more than 30 years, measles still represents a major harbinger of death in low income countries. serologic testing was deemed positive in the presence of immunoglobulin M antibody (IgM) or in case of a significant rise in measles antibody level. all cases were indigenously acquired in accordance with the measles classification established by the CDC. asles infection was defined as a body temperature 38.3\u00b0C. before admission to the ICU, antimicrobial treatment, steroids, or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs were recorded. airway bacterial superinfection was defined by the presence of a new infiltrate. samples deemed valid for microbiologic assessment included sputum culture, blood culture, and detection of urine antigens of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila. CAP was defined in the case of microbiologically documented coinfection of the lower airway tract before hospitalization or within 72 hours of hospital admission. if spontaneous breathing was maintained, bacterial superinfection was based on the yield of sputum culture (threshold 107 CFU/mL) serologic testing was deemed positive in the presence of immunoglobulin M antibody (IgM) or in case of a significant rise in measles antibody level by any standard serologic assay. all cases were indigenously acquired in accordance with the measles classification established by the CDC. measles-related hepatitis was based on an increase of serum aminotransferases at least >2 times the upper limit of normal laboratory range. rhabdomyolysis was characterized as a platelet count 150,000 cells/mm3. airway bacterial superinfection was defined by the presence of a new infiltrate, at least 2 of the following criteria: temperature >38.3\u00b0C, purulent tracheal secretions or purulent sputum, an elevated leukocyte count >10,000/L, and a positive quantitative culture of distal secretions obtained from tracheal aspirations (threshold 106 colony-forming units [CFU]/mL) CAP was defined in the case of microbiologically documented coinfection of the lower airway tract before hospitalization or within 72 hours of hospital admission. if spontaneous breathing was maintained, bacterial superinfection was based on the yield of sputum culture (threshold 107 CFU/mL) measles-related hepatitis was based on an increase of serum aminotransferases at least >2 times the upper limit of normal laboratory range. rhabdomyolysis was characterized as a platelet count 150,000 cells/mm3. airway bacterial superinfection was defined by the presence of a new infiltrate, at least 2 of the following criteria: temperature >38.3\u00b0C, purulent tracheal secretions or purulent sputum, an elevated leukocyte count >10,000/L, and a positive quantitative culture of distal secretions obtained from tracheal aspirations (threshold 106 colony-forming units [CFU]/mL) CAP was defined in the case of microbiologically documented coinfection of the lower airway tract before hospitalization or within 72 hours of hospital admission. if spontaneous breathing was maintained, bacterial superinfection was based on the yield of sputum culture and S. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila urinary antigen testing. in all but 1 case, measles infection occurred during winter or spring. the vast majority of cases occurred during the year 2011 (74.3%) chronic respiratory disease in this group of patients included intermittent asthma (n = 6), bronchiectasis (n = 1), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n = 1), restrictive lung disease (n = 1). causes of immunosuppression included human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (CD4+ lymphocyte count: 10 cell/mm3, 3 month prior hospital admission) measles pneumonitis was the sole complication requiring hospitalization in an ICU unit (n = 32) one patient developed histologically ascertained Hecht pneumonia following measles infection and after a first course of chemotherapy for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. two patients developed both respiratory and neurologic complications, both of which were affected by PIE. thoracic imaging upon admission did not display any abnormality in 3 cases (21.2%). prevailing diagnosis was measles pneumonitis because of biologically ascertained measles infection, significant hypoxemia, and lack of alternative diagnosis. airway Bacterial Superinfection and Causative Microorganisms Clinical characteristics, microbiology features, and outcome among the 8 patients with measles pneumonitis. only 4 patients did not receive antibiotics at any time during medical management. 5 patients met criteria for severe ARDS, 2 patients could be classified as moderate ARDS, and 2 additional patients as mild ARDS. none of the 5 pregnant women required mechanical ventilation. extraalveolar air leak complications occurred in 4 cases and 5 patients died. neurologic complications following measles infection consisted of 3 cases of PIE, 1 case of probable MIBE, and 1 case of intracerebral hemorrhage. no direct connection could be established between measles infection and the occurrence of intracerebral hemorrhage. all 3 patients had the typical morbillous rash along with fever. in 2 cases altered mental status, without epilepsy, was the predominant symptom. in the third case, initial clinical assessment was suggestive of meningitis, and the patient experienced 1 seizure. a brain MRI substantiated hyperintense signals affecting the right thalamus and peduncle. the patient\u2019s immunosuppressive regimen of mycophenolate mofetil 250 mg twice daily and prednisone 7 mg once daily was withheld. without epilepsy on iterative EEG, the patient was placed under mechanical ventilation a week after his admission. a total of 8 patients received at least 1 of the following treatments. ribavirin (n = 4), IVIG therapy (n = 5), plasma therapy (n = 1), steroids (n = 4), or vitamin A treatment (n = 1). 1 patient with MIBE was treated with a combination of plasma exchange and steroid pulse therapy. only slight motor improvement was observed following treatment completion. another patient with seizures related to PIE underwent IVIG therapy. measles inclusion body encephalitis (MIBE) was not included in the analysis given the undetermined time of infection. the vast majority of cases occurred during the year 2011 (74.3%) 34 patients with measles Pneumonitis Measles infection developed as a result of possible cross-transmission in 10 cases (27.8%) chronic respiratory disease in 9 patients, immunosuppression in 6 patients, and obesity in 3 cases. causes included intermittent asthma (n = 6), bronchiectasis (n = 1), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n = 1), restrictive lung disease (n = 1). the median time between the onset of measles and dyspnea was 6 days (IQR, 3\u20137 d) one patient developed histologically ascertained Hecht (giant cell) pneumonia following measles infection and after a first course of chemotherapy for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. the pattern of interstitial pneumonitis consisted of micronodular opacities (n = 4), ground-glass opacities (n = 4), and reticulonodular lesions (n = 3). mixed alveolar and interstitial lesions were seen in 4 (11.7%) cases. thoracic imaging upon admission did not display any abnormality in 3 cases (21.2%) airway Bacterial Superinfection and Causative Microorganisms Clinical characteristics, microbiology features, and outcome among the 8 patients with measles pneumonitis and proven bacterial superinfection. only 4 patients did not receive antibiotics at any time during medical management. 1 patient developed pulmonary aspergillosis following chemotherapy for stage IV non-Hodgkin lymphoma. one patient had bacterial pharyngitis consecutive to beta-hemolytic Streptococcus. tracheobronchitis superinfection occurred in 2 instances. 2 patients died during the course of ICU management, albeit none as direct consequence of air leak disease. thoracic imaging among patients admitted for measles disclosed an exclusive pattern of interstitial pneumonitis in 21 (61.7%) cases. two patients with CAP along with measles pneumonitis (n = 4) had repeated CT scans during their stays in the ICU because of persistent and severe hypoxemia. in both cases, in addition to the interstitial lesion pattern initially substantiated, the CT scans demonstrated lobar consolidation of the lower lobes. 8 patients with measles pneumonitis and proven bacterial superinfection documented ten episodes of pulmonary bacterial superinfection. one patient developed pulmonary aspergillosis following chemotherapy for stage IV non-Hodgkin lymphoma. 5 patients met the criteria for severe ARDS, 2 patients could be classified as moderate ARDS, and 2 additional patients as mild ARDS. none of the 5 pregnant women required mechanical ventilation. none of the patients with ARDS required mechanical ventilation. neurologic complications following measles infection consisted of 3 cases of PIE, 1 case of probable MIBE, and 1 case of intracerebral hemorrhage. no direct connection could be established between measles infection and the occurrence of intracerebral hemorrhage. medulla MRI T2-weighted coronal fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence depicted a diffuse hyperintense signal of the medulla indicative of myelitis. a history of possible measles cross-transmission was noted 3 months before the first neurologic symptoms. the patient\u2019s immunosuppressive regimen of mycophenolate mofetil 250 mg twice daily and prednisone 7 mg once daily was withheld. without epilepsy, he was placed under mechanical ventilation a week after his admission. a control brain MRI performed on day 10 revealed partial resolution of the abnormalities. mechanical ventilation was warranted in 2 cases as a result of neurologic failure. a 37-year-old kidney transplant recipient presented with an episode of focal seizure affecting the right upper limb followed by grand mal seizure. antibodies on 2 plasma samples contemporaneous with the neurologic symptoms. a third sample collected 5 months before the symptoms was negative. a control brain MRI performed on day 10 revealed partial resolution of the abnormalities. 8 patients received at least 1 of the following treatments: ribavirin (n = 4), IVIG therapy (n = 5), plasma therapy (n = 1), steroids (n = 4), or vitamin A treatment (n = 1). Primary indication was measles pneumonitis complicated by ARDS (n = 4) or severe hypoxemia (n = 1). 8 patients received at least 1 of the following treatments: ribavirin (n = 4), IVIG therapy (n = 5), plasma therapy (n = 1), steroids (n = 4), vitamin A treatment (n = 1). Primary indication was measles pneumonitis complicated by ARDS (n = 4) or severe hypoxemia (n = 1). on follow-up 1 patient had severe chronic respiratory failure related to a fibrosing sequelae 6 months following measles pneumonitis complicated with ARDS. two patients had mild gait disorder due to mild lower limb paraparesis along with bladder dysfunction 3 months after developing encephalitis and myelitis ascribable to measles. patients we observed a severe course with frequent bacterial superinfections, a possible propensity for barotraumas, a high mortality rate and diagnostic caveats. the clinical expression of measles-induced neurologic complications is varied and often misleading. patients can be left with severe neurologic impairments. the dynamic pattern of lesions suggests lobar consolidation may result from the progressive coalescence of micronodular lesions. lower airway tract superinfections affected only 8 patients (24.2% of patients with respiratory symptoms) this incidence dropped to 12.1% when only patients with CAP are considered. present study was the state of lymphopenia, which affected 24 of 28 patients. measles is able to induce lymphocyte depletion, including apoptosis in both infected and uninfected lymphocytes. MV interferes with lymphocyte function by suppressing T-cell proliferation. measles-induced ARDS in immunocompromised patients can be especially deceiving, with otherwise uncommon complications, and the hallmark rash may be limited or absent. 26.7% of patients with measles pneumonitis (n = 9) had a prior history of chronic respiratory impairment. measles is known to cause fetal growth restriction, premature birth, or spontaneous abortion. the course of measles was eventless in all but 1 patient who underwent cesarean delivery because of fetal growth restriction after 38 weeks of gestation. of 4 patients with air leak disease in the current study, 2 were immunocompromised. study found 1 case of tracheobronchitis, 1 case of otitis, and 2 cases of sinusitis. ifocal neurologic deficit including signs of myelitis rank among the most commonly reported symptoms. mild lymphocytic pleocytosis and hyperproteinorachia on CSF examination were noted as in previous reports. distinctive neuropathologic features, including perivascular inflammation and demyelination, resemble the features of experimental allergic encephalitis. so far, 5 cases have been reported in kidney transplant recipients. the following clinical and laboratory investigations can lend support to this hypothesis. a normal CSF analysis, b) history of epilepsy both focal and generalized. asymptomatic rhabdomyolysis is another frequent metabolic disturbance, although its precise mechanism remains elusive. lymphopenia is highly prevalent, as exemplified in this study. a single injection of measles vaccine was officially included in the vaccination schedule for infants aged 12\u201315 months. twenty-eight patients (78%) were born during the critical 1980\u20131996 period, in a time of poor immunization rates. it is now clear that an immunization rate short of 95% is unlikely to provide \u201cherd protection\u201d or to impede the circulation of measles virus in small groups of unvaccinated subjects. in immunocompromised patients, experience with ribavirin is at best anecdotal. in immunocompromised patients, experience with ribavirin is at best anecdotal and success has been varied in patients with pneumonitis or MIBE. in 1 case, the treatment was withheld after 6 days because of ribavirin-induced hemolysis. measles is a disease with protean clinical manifestations, among which respiratory and neurologic complications, such as ARDS and PIE, are the most dreaded. despite efforts to gather as many cases of measles as possible, the case collection was not exhaustive. most of the 9 patients who had CT scans on admission, the abnormalities displayed were bilateral micronodular lesions or ground-glass opacities. another debatable issue is the reliability of chest imaging to correctly identify patients with bacterial superinfection. as many as 50% of patients were reported to have bacterial superinfection. prophylactic antibiotic therapy has previously been considered as a way to reduce the burden of lung bacterial superinfection, primarily in african children. immunocompromised patients progressed towards ARDS, and 4 died. measles case mortality in the context of HIV coinfection has been previously reported in african children. measles infection in immunocompromised patients can be especially deceiving, with otherwise uncommon complications, and the hallmark rash may be limited or absent. 26.7% of patients with measles pneumonitis (n = 9) had a prior history of chronic respiratory impairment, a figure close to those reported in severe H1N1 infection. ak Complications Another frequent adverse event observed during measles infection was the occurrence of extraalveolar air leak complications. a parallel can be drawn with patients who developed pneumothoraces as a result of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) upper airway infection can arise either due to direct viral infection or bacterial superinfection in adults. a radiographic pattern of interstitial lesions is recognized as characteristic of measles pneumonitis. the findings are in accord with previous reports since 23 patients (69.7%) with measles pneumonitis presented with radiographic abnormalities consistent with interstitial lesions. the dynamic pattern of lesions suggests that lobar consolidation might result from the progressive coalescence of micronodular lesions. lower airway tract superinfections affected only 8 patients (24.2% of patients with respiratory symptoms) this incidence dropped to 12.1% when only patients with CAP are considered. apoptosis in both infected and uninfected lymphocytes,55 enhanced adhesion of lymphocytes in secondary lymphoid organ,51 or loss of precursors through thymic epithelial cell infection. MV interferes with lymphocyte function by suppressing T-cell proliferation,42 damping IL-2 responses, and negatively impacting downward signaling. this state of immunosuppression is age dependant and tends to last longer in adults. patients who developed ARDS as a consequence of measles-induced ARDS did so in the later stage of the disease as reflected by the delay between initial symptoms and ICU admission. if severe respiratory impairment in this subset of patients results from the direct consequence of the virus per se or to late bacterial superinfection. measles is known to cause fetal growth restriction, premature birth, or spontaneous abortion. the course of measles was eventless in all but 1 patient who underwent cesarean delivery because of fetal growth restriction after 38 weeks of gestation. of 4 patients with air leak disease in the current study, 2 were immunocompromised. study found 1 case of tracheobronchitis, 1 case of otitis, and 2 cases of sinusitis. in all 3 patients, mild lymphocytic pleocytosis and hyperproteinorachia were noted as in previous reports. the key pathogenic mechanism in PIE is believed to be demyelination mediated by an autoimmune process during the stage of recovery from infection. distinctive neuropathologic features, including perivascular inflammation, resemble the features of experimental allergic encephalitis. so far, 5 cases have been reported in kidney transplant recipients. a brain biopsy can definitively ascertain the diagnosis of MIBE. the following clinical and laboratory investigations can lend support to this hypothesis. yelination mediated by an autoimmune process during the stage of recovery from infection, generally within 2 weeks of the exanthema. none of the 3 patients with PIE was tested for the presence of MV in the CSF by PCR. distinctive neuropathologic features resemble the features of experimental allergic encephalitis. thrombocytopenia and elevation of CK levels and aminotransferases are common findings in measles infection. elevated aminotransferase levels were frequent, affecting 50% of patients. rhabdomyolysis is another frequent metabolic disturbance, although its precise mechanism remains elusive. in the span of 9 years, immunization against measles rose from 32% (1984) to 80% (1994), while at the same time measles ceased to be an endemic disease among children. in 1996, a second injection was added to the schedule as part of a noncompulsory \u201ccatch up\u201d program designed for unvaccinated individuals. most of the patients who developed measles in the current series were young adults. an immunization coverage rate short of 95% is unlikely to provide \u201cherd protection\u201d or to impede the circulation of measles virus in small groups of unvaccinated subjects. these pockets of susceptible individuals act as a reservoir capable of fueling new outbreaks. the gradual shift in the clinical pattern of measles from a childhood and generally benign infection to a lethal disease affecting young adults. both of these immunocompromised patients had severe measles pneumonitis. ribavirin therapy was initiated promptly after the onset of the disease. in 1 case, the treatment was withheld after 6 days because of ribavirin-induced hemolysis. measles infection in immunocompromised patients can be challenging in the face of specific complications and absent or atypical morbillous rash. airway bacterial superinfection, likely to be favored by MV-induced immunosuppression, represents an additional concern."}
