{"summary": "myelin is damaged due to an immune attack consisted of several pathways and molecules, leading to impaired nerve function. autoantibodies and autoreactive T cells activated against myelin antigens such as myelin basic protein (MBP), proteolipid protein (PLP) and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) have been detected in MS patients. major criticism of the autoimmune hypothesis is that autoantigens specific to and causative for MS has never been identified. however, recent reports suggest that demyelination may precede inflammation. the latter may imply that immunity plays a major role in MS. the most studied experimental demyelination is infection of mice with theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus. TMEV infection in macrophages is productive, resulting in cell lysis and liberation of more virions. a persistent CNS infection is established as virus spreads from macrophage to macrophage. autoimmune responses to myelin antigens are observed following infection with TMEV. despite this autoimmunity to myelin components may not play a major role in the initiation of demyelination, it may contribute to lesion progression in chronically diseased animals. TMEV infection in mice is productive, resulting in cell lysis and liberation of more virions. TMEV infection in macrophages is restricted, and results in apoptosis of macrophages. a persistent CNS infection is established as virus spreads from macrophages. virus-induced demyelination animal model is semliki forest virus (SFV) infection of mice. initial immune-mediated demyelination may be due to targeting of oligodendrocytes by cytotoxic T-cells. many studies related to the virus infection in MS involve the demonstration of increased antibody titers against a particular virus. despite such a detailed investigation there is a lack of a conclusive remark on whether HHV-6 is associated to MS. the absence of evidence does not necessary imply the evidence of absence [61]. there may be two possible options: the virus might reactivate after a long term latency, up to years and lyse oligodendrocytes. the first option might be progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy (PML) through the infection of JC virus. the later is the case of TMEV encephalomyelitis model, as well as infections with corona viruses, and lenti viruses. the pathology share similarities with the one induced in EAE. induced encephalomyelitis is probably the best currently used model of virus-induced immune-mediated demyelination in susceptible mice. TMEV is divided into two subgroups: high-neurovirulent strains, including GDVII and FA, which cause fatal encephalitis, and low-neurovirulent strains, such as DA and BeAn, which cause persistent infection and demyelination in mice. there is growing evidence about possible mechanisms by which virus infection can trigger autoimmunity. molecular mimicry involves the de novo activation of autoreactive T cells due to the cross-reactivity between self epitopes and viral epitopes during a virus infection. tope mimic, directly induced autoreactive T cells with pathologic potential in absence of CFA. the later may be considered as a big advantage of this molecular mimicry model. the virus-induced model is \"provided\" by the virus per se. peptide by searching a sequence database for viral and bacterial mimicry peptides of MBP(85\u201399), 8 yielded peptides performed biological activity and stimulated MBP(85\u201399)-specific T-cell clones. this mechanism requires destruction of specific tissue such as CNS, release of sequestered antigen such as those of myelin and increased local immune inflammation. LP epitope139-152 has the ability to demyelinate organotypic cultures of spinal cord. no similar results were obtained when the cells were stimulated with MBP. this phenomenon has been described in a number of autoimmune diseases, TMEV included [87-90] axonal loss can follow primary, immune-mediated demyelination in the CNS. inflammatory demyelination influences axon pathology during relapsing-remitting MS. axonal injury occurs even in the normal appearing white matter [99] where inflammation may be minimal or absent. axonal injury was associated with parenchymal infiltration of microglia and T cells. viral antigen and damaged axons were present within intact myelin sheaths. inflammatory demyelinating lesions were not seen until the chronic phase (4 weeks after infection)"}
