{"summary": "virus severity was grouped using a categorization index as very mild/mild, and moderate/severe. the most common discharge diagnoses were \"URTI\" with or without LRTI/asthma. acute lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) and upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) are the most commonly encountered diseases for hospitalization, especially in infants and young children. LRTIs are more harmful than URTIs. in infancy and early childhood are related to recurrent wheezing and asthma in later life [7]. the purpose of current study was to determine the incidence and seasonal patterns of viral etiological agents and to compare their clinical manifestations and disease severity, including single and coinfections. disease severity was assessed by using a categorization index. a categorization index was similar to categorization of disease (viral RTIs) severity by Bezerra et al. a sensitive multiplex PCR panel was used to demonstrate 14 viral agents during acute RTIs. adenovirus (AdV), bocavirus (BcV), human coronavirus (CoV) and group 2 (OC43 and HKU1) were included in the panel. ESR was evaluated as normal (2.8 mg/L), mildly elevated (2.8-15 mg/L), moderately elevated (16\u201350 mg/L) and excessively elevated (>50 mg/L) in 91 children. the diagnosis of bronchopneumonia was established on clinical findings. symptoms included fever, tachypnea, tachycardia, hypotension, hypoxemia, dehydration, and convulsion. disease severity was assessed by using a categorization index. severe disease was described as the lower respiratory symptoms/signs +/2 upper respiratory symptoms/signs. baseline vital signs including fever, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, and pulse rate were listed at the time of assessment. patients with at least two symptoms and/or signs of RTI including fever, cough, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, nasal flaring, intercostal/subcostal retractions, and central cyanosis received a posterior nasal swab for virus detection. es type 1\u20134 (PIV1\u20134), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus (RhV) samples were frozen at 20\u00b0C and transported on ice to the Department of Clinical Microbiology and Virology Laboratory of our university for viral nucleic acid amplification. there were 61 males and 42 females with a male/female ratio of 1.4 to 1. The characteristics of patients are shown in Table 1. The mean age of patients was 34.9 (1\u2013106) months, where 89.4% of patients where 5 years of age. there were 61 males and 42 females with a male/female ratio of 1.4 to 1. The characteristics of patients are shown in Table 1. the mean age of patients was 34.9 (1\u2013106) months, where 89.4% of patients where 5 years of age. ogens were RSV (32%), AdV (26.2%), PIV 1\u20134 (19.4%), RhV (18.4%), Flu (12.6%), MPV (12.6%), CoV (2.9%), and BcV (0.9%). only three coV and one BcV infections were detected. 0 CoV 3 2.9 2 2.4 1 4.7 FluA&B 13 12.6 8 9.7 5 23.8 MPV 13 12.6 7 8.5 6 28.6 PIV1-4 20 19.4 12 14.7 8 38.0 RhV 19 18.5 9 11 10 47.6 RSV 33* 32.0 23 28 10 47.6 Total 103 82 21 *: p0.05. ma* AdV 27 26.2 22 5 0 1 4 0 BoV 1 0 0 1 0 CoV 3 2 1 0 0 1 0 FluA&B 13 12.6 6 2 5 1 4 2 MPV 13 12.6 3 3 7 2 7 1 PIV1-4 20 19.4 7 6 7 1 11 1 RhV 19 18.5 10 3 6 1 6 2 RSV 33 32.0 6 5 22 10 14 3 Coinfection 21 20.4 11 7 3 0 9 1 Single 82 79. all of the patients with AdV were in Group I, they have mostly very mild disease than mild disease. most of the patients with coinfection had very mild (47.6% of coinfections) and mild disease (38.7%) none of them had moderate and severe disease (p=0.000) NS Hospitalization >120 hours 6 (7.6%) 11 (45.9%) 0.000 Hospitalization >96 hours 20 (25.2%) 15 (62.5%) 0.001 Primarily URTI 41 (51.9%) 0 0.000 Primarily LRTI 38 (48.1%) 24 (100%) 0.000 Bronchiolitis 11 (14%) 5 (20.8%) NS Bronchopneumonia 25 (31.6%) 12 (50%) NS Asthmatic attack 2 (2.5%) 7 (29.2%) hypnea 1* 1 3 3 4* 8 21 Hypoxia 0 1 0 1 2 1 4 Dehydration 3 1 1 2 2 2 2 11 Convulsion 1 0 0 0 1 0 2 Total 20 8 7 12 9 23 82 *: p0.05. Fever was observed in 50.5% of the patients with RTIs, and its duration was between 72\u2013150 hours. PIV1 was identified in March and June, PIV2 in February and May, and PIV4 in June and August. CoV and BcV were detected in low percentages during the study period. leukocytosis was detected in 20 (22.2%) patients. blood culture was studied in 37 (35.9%) of the patients. none of them had positive blood cultures. 58 had symptoms of URTI (56.3%) and 62 had symptoms of LRTI (60.2%) the discharge diagnoses of patients were divided as \"URTI only\" among LRTI and URTI + LRTI patients, the discharge diagnoses were bronchiolitis (15.5%), bronchopneumonia (36%) and asthmatic attack (8.7%) some viruses were more commonly identified with symptoms of URTI or LRTI. most of the patients with coinfection had very mild (47.6% of coinfections) and mild disease (38.0% of coinfections) most of the patients had very mild (47.6% of coinfections) and mild disease (38.0% of coinfections) patients positive for RSV (mean 26.5 months, 0\u201324 months: 66.7%) were significantly younger than the other hospitalized patients except for RhV (mean 26.0 months, 0\u201324 months: 73.7%). a higher percentage of AdV positive patients were diagnosed as URTI (p=0.000) in comparison to other viruses. AdV and influenza A&B had the longest mean duration of fever in RTI cases. the rate of dyspnea in RTIs with single RSV infections was 92.6% (43.5% of dyspneic patients) Neutrophilia was detected in 33 patients (36.6%), especially with AdV (n=15, p=0.000) and RhV (n=9, p=0.013). monocytosis was the most significant finding in the patients (n=48, 53.3%). RT-PCR assays make it possible to identify a large spectrum of viral agents, but an identified virus may be concerned with persistence of a virus after a recently afflicted RTI. up to two months of persistence has been shown in nasopharynx. coinfections were not more severe than single infections in this study. the presence of coinfections was not associated with extended duration of fever. the severity of coinfection may depend on the viruses involved. in 47.6% of coinfected patients, RSV was identified together RhV, AdV, PIV, FluA&B and MPV. it is the second most common virus in our study that associated with LRTI hospitalization (21% of LRTI) RhV is one of the increasingly identified viral agents with the use of PCR. it is the most common cause of URTI (especially common cold) in both adults and children. it was detected in 14-24% of hospitalized children with LRTI [25,26] MPV is one of the causes of upper and lower RTIs. it is a well-recognized viral agent of pneumonia in preschool and older children. MPV was detected in a higher percentage (12.4%) of hospitalized children. pnea (30.8%) were the most commonly encountered symptoms in hospitalized children with fluA&B. fever was reporded in 94.6% of patients with a mean level of 38.6\u00b0C. the mean duration of fever was 4.8 days in these patients. and signs include cough (77.6%), rales (23.3%), diarrhea (25.2%), vomiting (21.8%), abdominal pain (18.9%), conjunctivitis (13.6%), rashes (7.9%), and febrile seizure (3.1%) as reported by Chen et al. hematologic manifestation of influenza is lymphopenia with decreased lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio. monocytosis was the most significant finding in the patients with AdV. there was not any negative effect on the conditions of coinfections. author(s) declare that they have no competing interests. authors\u2019 contributions SB conceived of the study, and participated in its design and coordination and drafted the manuscript. edward et al."}
