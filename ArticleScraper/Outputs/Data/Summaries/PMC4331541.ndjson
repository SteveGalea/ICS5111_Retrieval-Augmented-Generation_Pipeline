{"summary": "the virions consist of naked nucleocapsids of about 20 nm in diameter, with a circular single stranded DNA genome of approximately 2.0 kb. they have an ambisense genome organization containing two major open reading frames (ORFs) inversely arranged, responsible for encoding the replicase (Rep) and capsid (Cap) proteins. some circoviruses are major pathogens of pigs [3\u20135 newly described circular genomes are similar to those of circoviruses. their distinct nucleotide/amino acid composition and genome organization allowed authors to propose the creation of a new genus within the Circoviridae. genome sequencing and phylogenetic analyses revealed four of the sequences represent viral genomes of new members of the family Circoviridae. the study did not involve any direct manipulation of bats. all experiments were performed in compliance with the european convention for the protection of vertebrate animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes. each sample consisted of pool of 5 fecal droppings, which were immediately sent to the laboratory. the samples were then thawed, resuspended and in 1 mL of Hank\u2019s balanced salt solution (HBSS), vortexed and centrifuged at 10.000 x g for 5 min. the supernatants were then transferred to fresh tubes, filtered through 0.45 m pore-size syringe filters. l2, 0.2 M of each primer (CV-F1 and CV-R1), 1.5 U Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen), 10% PCR buffer and 0.6 mM dNTPs. products with a size of approximately 400 bp were purified and directly sequenced using primer CV-R2. five microliters of PCR products were electrophoresed in 0.7% agarose gels. the products visualized on UV light after staining with ethidium bromide. standard precautions were taken to avoid contamination and negative controls were added to each batch of reactions. nucleotide sequences were aligned and compared to sequences of human, animal and sewage-associated members of the Circoviridae available at GenBank database using ClustalW [28]. the alignments were optimized with the BioEdit Sequence Alignment Editor Program version 7.0.9 [29]. the hairpin and stem-loop structures were identified in Mfold [30]. one hundred fecal samples were collected from the attic floor as described. each sample consisted of pool of 5 fecal droppings, which were immediately sent to the laboratory and stored at -80\u00b0C. the samples were then thawed, resuspended and in 1 mL of Hank\u2019s balanced salt solution (HBSS), vortexed and centrifuged for 5 min. the first reaction was performed in a 25 L volume containing 20 to 50 ng of sample DNA 1 mM MgCl2, 0.2 M of each primer (CV-F1 and CV-R1), 1.5 U Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen), 10% PCR buffer and 0.6 mM dNTPs. the cycling conditions were: 5 min at 95\u00b0C; 40 cycles of 1 min at 95\u00b0C, 1 min at 56\u00b0C, 1 min at 72\u00b0C primer sequences were aligned for designing new sets of primers to perform the inverse PCR (iPCR) five microliters of the PCR products were electrophoresed in 0.7% agarose gels and visualized on UV light after staining with ethidium bromide. standard precautions were taken to avoid contamination and negative controls were added to each batch of reactions. sequence of genomes was constructed by \u201cgenome walking\u201d using the Geneious software (version 7.1.3) nucleotide sequences were aligned and compared to sequences of human, animal and sewage-associated members of the Circoviridae available at GenBank database using ClustalW. clusters II (4 sequences), VI (3 sequences) and VII (2 sequences) fell into the clade of cycloviruses. clusters I (13 sequences) and V (2 sequences) formed distinct and distant groups from those formed by circoviruses. arbitrary division of these sequences in clusters was carried out to analyze their genomic features. the predicted CAP protein sequences consist of 197\u2013231 amino acids and share an amino acid identity of 24\u201376% with the known cycloviruses/circoviruses. the predicted REP protein sequences range from 232 to 280 amino acid and have an amino acid identity ranging from 9.2\u201344.4% among themselves. all four bat circular genomes contain a conserved nonanucleotide motif located at the 5\u2019 IGR (NANTATTAC) and are considered to be responsible for initiating the rolling-cycle replication of circoviruses [18,34]. cleotide motif sequence similar to the loop motif of cycloviruses found on bat, human and chimpanzee feces (BatCV POA II, V, VI) and slightly modified from those of Cyclovirus and Circovirus (BatCV POA I, VI) a/2012/II was related to a Cyclovirus detected in muscle tissues of a goat from pakistan through degenerate/consensus PCR. however, when analyzing both genomes according to the conserved rep-encoding region, it was observed that they formed a monophyletic clade. this situation was confirmed based on the alignments of the whole genomes, producing a similar tree topology. a phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences detected with those of the representative Circovirus and Cyclovirus sequences. clusters II (4 sequences), VI (3 sequences) and VII (2 sequences) fell into the clade of cycloviruses, in contrast to clusters I (13 sequences) and V (2 sequences) that formed distinct and distant groups from those formed by circoviruses. two full-length circular ssDNA genomes of 1,755 and 1,790 nt (named BatCV POA/2012/I and BatCV POA/2012/VI), and two nearly complete circular DNA genomes of 1,720 and 1,750 nt (named BatCV POA/2012/I and BatCV POA/2012/VI) were identified. the impossibility to achieve the complete sequencing of virus DNA from cluster VII was probably due to the high GC-rich content present protein (REP) and capsid protein (CAP) are shown in blue and red boxes, respectively. CAP and CAP are shown in blue and red boxes. all four bat circular genomes have a conserved nonanucleotide motif located at the 5\u2019 IGR (NANTATTAC) they are considered to be responsible for initiating the rolling-cycle replication of circoviruses. BatCV POA/2012/II and VI fell into the cyclovirus clade already identified in chickens, chimps, bats, goats, humans and dragonflies. but when analyzing both genomes according to the conserved rep-encoding region, it was observed that they formed a monophyletic clade. this situation was confirmed based on the alignment of the whole genomes, producing a similar tree topology. sequences identified in bat feces from southern Brazil are labeled by red diamonds. evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA5 [31]. two genomes belong to genus Cyclovirus. this study with known circoviruses/cycloviruses is worthy to understand the great diversity of circoviruses found worldwide. the finding of known insect viruses in bat feces simply reflects the diet of these insectivorous bats, which play an important role on predating insects. two more circular DNA genomes were characterized which did not fall within the circo/cycloviruses clade grouping instead distantly with TM6 and batCV-SC703 [17,18] both also from bat feces. these new genomes have in common the presence in the Rep N-terminus of the same motifs associated with rolling circle replication (FTLNN, TPHLQGY) and dNTP-binding (GXGKS) four new circular ssDNAs have been detected from bat feces. it is not clear if these new ssDNAs have some important role on pathogenesis. future investigations must include attempts in virus isolation to confirm host origin."}
