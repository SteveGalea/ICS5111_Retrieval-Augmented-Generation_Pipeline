{"summary": "gene size is the net result of evolution driven by the environment, mutation, and the genetics of a given organism [1], [2]. mutation rate is inversely proportional for a range of life forms from viroids to viruses to bacteria, and it is positive for eukaryotes. the genome size of RNA viruses is restricted to a range of 2 to 32 kb that corresponds to a very narrow band on the genome size scale (ranging from 1 kb to 10 Mb) ales is comprised of viruses with enveloped virions and non-segmented single-stranded linear RNA genomes of positive polarity (ssRNA+) the order includes four families - the Arteriviridae and Coronaviridae (including vertebrate, mostly mammalian viruses) and the Roniviridae and mesoniviridae (invertebrate viruses) pp1a and pp1ab are autoproteolytically processed into nonstructural proteins (nsp), named nsp1 to nsp12 in arteriviruses and nsp1 to nsp16 in coronaviruses. most of them are components of the membrane-bound replication-transcription complex (RTC) [31]\u2013[33] that mediates genome replication and the synthesis of subgenomic RNAs. two tightly correlated properties separate large- and intermediate-sized nidoviruses from all other ssRNA+ viruses. a genome size exceeding 20 kb and the presence of a gene encoding a RNA 3\u2032-to-5\u2032 exoribonuclease (ExoN) resides in nsp14 in the case of coronaviruses. nidovirus genome expansion (NGE) is defined by the entire range of the genome sizes of extant nidoviruses, from 12.7 to 31.7 kb. nidoviruses have evolved genomes in a size range that accounts for the upper 60% of the entire RNA virus genome size scale. this question could be addressed in two evolutionary dimensions: time and amount of substitutions. nidovirus-wide phylogenetic analysis consistently identified the five major lineages: subfamilies Coronavirinae and Torovirinae, and families Arteriviridae, Roniviridae and Mesoniviridae. nidoviruses with genome sizes of 12.7 to 15.7 kb are separated in the tree from other nidoviruses with larger genomes (20.2\u201331.7 kb). phylogenies of nidoviruses are drawn to a common scale of 0.1 amino acid substitutions per position. major lineages are indicated by vertical bars and names; arteri: Arteriviridae, mesoni: Mesoniviridae, roni: Roniviridae, toro: Torovirinae, corona: Coronavirinae. rooting was according to either (A) domain-specific outgroups [10 the distances separating the intermediate-sized mesonivirus from other nidoviruses tend to be most equidistant, accounting for 15% of all distances in the 0.55\u20130.85 range. nidovirus evolution involved the accumulation of mutations in the most conserved proteins at a scale comparable to that of the ToL. values quantifying genetic divergence between major lineages are partitioned in three clusters taking into account genome sizes. large-sized vs. large-sized nidoviruses (cluster II, X: 0.002\u20135.433 kb, Y: 3.197\u20134.292), intermediate-sized vs. other lineages (cluster III, X: 4.475\u201311.494 kb, Y: 2.896\u20134.553), and small the number of comparisons for each pair of major clades is indicated by numbers in brackets. points were grouped into clusters I (intra-lineage comparisons), II (large- vs. large-sized inter-lineage comparisons), III (intermediate-sized vs. others) and IV (small- vs. large-sized) only a fraction of genome size changes may be attributed to known domain gain or loss. the fraction that could be attributed to these and the three other protein domains is even smaller in other pairs of viruses representing different major nidovirus lines (CL & AEG) the coding regions are partitioned into ORF1a (yellow), ORF1b (violet) and the 3\u2032ORFs (blue), which also differ in expression mechanism as indicated on top. to address this challenge, we developed an approach that establishes and exploits relationships between nidovirus genomes in an alignment-free manner on grounds other than sequence homology. the genomes of all nidoviruses can be consistently partitioned into five regions in the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 order. the 5\u2032-UTR and 3\u2032-UTR flank the coding regions and account for 5% of the nidovirus genome size. the nidovirus genome expanded unevenly across the three major coding regions. we then asked how the different regions contributed to the genome expansion. the intermediate position of the mesonivirus between the two other nidovirus groups is observed only in genome-wide but not in region-specific size comparisons. nidovirus species (large) and one intermediate-sized mesonivirus species (interm.) distributions are represented by box-and-whisker graphs, where the box spans from the first to the third quartile. the whiskers extend (dashed lines) to the extreme values. the splines model significantly outperforms the double-logistic model (p = 0.0014) this results established that the nidovirus genome expanded in a non-linear and region-specific fashion. the three major coding regions expanded consecutively. a cycle involves expanding predominantly and consecutively the ORF1b, ORF1a, and 3\u2032ORFs region. the complete cycle encompasses almost the entire genome size range of nidoviruses, starting from 12.7 kb and ending at 31.7 kb. genome regions ORF1a, ORF1b, 3\u2032ORFs, 5\u2032UTR and 3\u2032UTR are calculated according to the splines regression and plotted on top of each other and against their sum = 1. the first wave (ORF1b) is most symmetrical and starts and ends at almost zero contribution to the genome size change. nidoviruses have evolved genomes in a size range that accounts for the upper 60% of the entire RNA virus genome size scale. the scales of per-residue evolutionary change in nidoviruses and the Tree of Life are comparable. nidovirus-wide phylogenetic analysis consistently identified the five major lineages: subfamilies Coronavirinae and Torovirinae, and families Arteriviridae, Roniviridae and Mesoniviridae. the root was placed at the branch leading to arteriviruses, according to outgroup analyses. phylogenies of nidoviruses are drawn to a common scale of 0.1 amino acid substitutions per position. major lineages are indicated by vertical bars and names; arteri: Arteriviridae, mesoni: roni: Roniviridae, toro: Torovirinae, corona: Coronavirinae. rooting was according to either (A) domain-specific outgroups [10] or (B) as described

(SHFV) has the largest known genome (15,717 nt) the fraction that could be attributed to these and the three other protein domains is even smaller in other pairs of viruses representing different

and 3\u2032ORFs) or large-sized (ORF1b) nidoviruses. the distributions are represented by box-and-whisker graphs. the box spans from the first to the third quartile and includes the median (bold line) the whiskers extend (dashed lines) to the extreme values. nidoviruses representing species diversity are plotted against size of the genome. the splines model significantly outperforms the double-logistic model (p = 0.0014) this results established that the nidovirus genome expanded in a non-linear and region-specific fashion. a cycle involves expanding predominantly and consecutively

entire NGE dynamics. nidoviruses occupy different positions on the trajectory that depicts the entire NGE dynamics. nidoviruses occupy different positions on the trajectory that depicts the entire NGE dynamics. nidoviruses may be shaped by the division of labor between ORFs that control genome replication, genome expression, and virus dissemination. the small range of RNA genome sizes might have been perceived as evidence for the lack of meaningful genome size dynamics in RNA viruses. nidoviruses may be shaped by the division of labor between ORFs that control genome replication, genome expression, and virus dissemination. a virus that is closely related to the unique intermediate-sized NDiV was independently identified in a parallel study [26]. both viruses share all properties that are critical for this study, including the size of genome and ORFs as well as the assignment of protein domains. this clustering correlates with common (molecular) properties, including infection of invertebrate hosts. methyltransferases, NMT and OMT are adjacent domains of a single protein in coronaviruses (nsp14) whereas OMT resides nearby (nsp16) in pp1ab suggests a link between these domains and indicates that NMT and OMT may have been acquired in a single event. the acquisition is a hallmark of the first NGE wave because it is expected to have improved the replication fidelity. the second wave in large-sized vertebrate nidoviruses includes changes that predominantly happened during the radiation of a subfamily. the third wave encompasses changes that predominantly happened during the radiation of a subfamily (Coronavirinae) rather than several families. improved future virus sampling could be critical for the description of domain gain/loss in ORF1a and its refinement in ORF1b. proteins encoded in ORF1a and ORF1b interact in coronaviruses [34], [37], [70], [81]\u2013[83]. nsp10 and nsp14 or nsp16 may have triggered or become accommodative of the expansion of ORF1a. the final wave of expansion may have been triggered by the need for virus particle adaptation to accommodate the expanded genome. newly acquired genetic material may have been adapted to facilitate virus-host interactions. in arteriviruses the ORF1a-encoded nsp1 is essential for subgenomic mRNA synthesis and virion biogenesis. a role in transcription was proposed for an ORF1a-encoded domain of nsp3 in coronaviruses. large genomes could provide nidoviruses with expanded toolkit to adapt. high mutation rates and large population sizes allow RNA viruses to explore evolutionary space. but low fidelity of replication confines evolution within a narrow genome size range. this constraint may determine the upper limit of RNA virus genome size. wavelike dynamics model links virus discovery to basic research and its various applications. but low fidelity of replication confines evolution within a narrow genome size range that must affect their adaptation potential. nidoviruses expanded their genomes in parallel in an increasing number of lineages. the genome expansion model can predict the sizes of the three coding regions by knowing the genome size only. the wavelike dynamics model links virus discovery to basic research and its various applications. nidovirus genomes represent species diversity from the three established. to correct for the uneven sampling we assigned relative weights to the 28 nidovirus species by using position-based sequence weights [110] that were calculated on the alignment submitted for phylogeny reconstruction. the weights were normalized to sum up to one and were used in regression analyses. we applied third order monotone splines with equidistant knots [111]. the monotonicity constraint was enforced to avoid overfitting. third order functions were chosen to obtain smooth, second-order derivatives. linear and splines regression models were compared using standard weighted F-statistics and a specially designed permutation test. the test was further modified to include weighted residuals according to virus sequence weights that account for sequence dependence. the linear and splines models were fit to the permuted datasets. the contribution of each genome region according to a model was calculated as the ratio of change in region size to change in genome size. this was calculated as the ratio of change in region size to change in genome size along the nidovirus genome size scale. a maximum parsimony reconstruction of the ancestral nidovirus protein domain states at internal nodes of the nidovirus tree was conducted using PAML4 [108]. the quality of ancestral reconstructions was assessed by accuracy values provided by PAML4. the nidovirus genomic sequences are non-independent due to their phylogenetic relatedness. regression functions were fitted simultaneously to sizes of the genomic regions by minimizing the residual sum of squares. the linear model assumes a constant contribution of each genomic region during evolution which was modeled via linear regions. the monotonicity constraint was enforced to avoid overfitting which was observed otherwise. a double-logistic curve comprises not more than three steady and two growth phases. the \u201clength\u201d of the different phases (in the dimension of the independent variable; e.g. genome size) and the \u201cstrength\u201d of the growth (e.g. the maximum slope of the curve between two steady states) are controlled by the parameters of the regression function. the linear and splines models were fit to the permuted datasets and F-statistics were calculated as for the original dataset. the p-value of the test is the fraction of F-statistics of permuted datasets larger than the F of the original dataset. d domains (RsD) was identified in this study by inspection of the pp1b alignment as a ronivirus-specific insertion (163 aa) the nidovirus ancestral domain compositions were reconstructed using a maximum parsimony analysis implemented in PAML4. the nidovirus phylogeny was mapped on the genome size scale (dotted lines) the linear regressions fit the data with p = 0.11, r2 = 0.63 (arteri) and p = 0.51, r2 = 0.03 (corona, toro/bafini, roni) for ORF1a, p = 0.34, r2 = 0.30 and p = 0.08. the only significant correlation was observed for 3\u2032ORFs of nidoviruses with large genomes (A) where the regression line showed this difference was in the range of 1\u20137% and increased with decreasing knot number in all three regions (D\u2013F); it could be seen as the loss of fit relative to the 7-knot configuration. we calculated the model dependence on the position of the first knot by evaluating all positions that do not result in empty bins for the 7-knot configuration. the splines and double-logistic models predict a cyclic pattern of overlapping wavelike increases of sizes for the three ORFs regions. the double-logistic model may be an approximation of the monotone splines model facilitating biologically meaningful interpretations."}
