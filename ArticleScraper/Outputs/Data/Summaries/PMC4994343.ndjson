{"summary": "the study was approved by the Ministry of the National Guard Health Affairs Institutional Review Board. the study was conducted at King Abdulaziz Medical City, a 1,100-bed tertiary care center in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. study procedures During July\u2013October 2015, we screened serum samples from study participants using a spike protein subunit 1 (S1)\u2013based ELISA. for MERS-CoV patients with a nonreactive ELISA result, we collected a follow up sample 14\u201321 days later for repeat ELISA. a positive control for ORF1a and upE rRT-PCR was performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. for Cts >35, we repeated the testing using different samples, preferably from the lower respiratory tract, to avoid false-positive results. samples with an IFA titer of >1:10 were considered reactive according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. we revised the criteria for plasma donation to be based on MN assay results. the presence of neutralizing MERS-CoV antibodies was also assessed. rRT-PCR, ELISA, and IFA testing for MERS-CoV were performed at the King Abdulaziz Medical City laboratory. the highest dilution of serum sample resulted in a >50% reduction in OD, compared with the control containing no antibody. study participants were considered candidates for plasma donation if they had a reactive ELISA result. patients who met all criteria were eligible for plasma donation according to the institutional criteria. each phase 2\u2013enrolled patient would require 2 fresh-frozen plasma units (250\u2013350 mL/unit) tested the extracted nucleic acids by rRT-PCR targeting the upstream envelope protein gene (upE) and open-reading frame 1a regions of the MERS-CoV genome on a lightCycler 480 System (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) real-time PCR (19). a positive control for ORF1a and upE was performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. MERS-CoV IgG was detected by adding FITC-labeled goat anti\u2013human IgG (Euroimmun AG); positive and negative controls were included. samples with an IFA titer of >1:10 were considered reactive. rRT-PCR, ELISA, and IFA testing for MERS-CoV were performed at the King Abdulaziz Medical City laboratory. the highest dilution of serum sample resulted in a >50% reduction in OD, compared with the control containing no antibody. the confirmatory IFA was reactive for all 4 of those healthcare workers. only 1 healthcare worker had a high MN titer (800) but she was not considered a candidate for plasma donation because of a previous pregnancy. exposed healthcare workers who had negative rRT-PCR results also had nonreactive ELISA results. MERS-CoV infection 5 (2.6) ELISA-reactive serum sample 8 (4.1) Median time to testing positive, d (Q1, Q3) 7 (4, 12) Household contacts of confirmed MERS-CoV patients, N = 17 Median age (range), y 37 (26, 46) Sex M 6 (35.3) F 11 (64.7) Data from a self-administered survey question answered by 200 healthcare workers. 196 patients with suspected or laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection were tested. 183 (88.8%) were hospitalized in the emergency department, 11 (5.8%) in the intensive care unit, and 2 (0.97%) in the medical wards. one of the 6 patients (no. 7) had high IFA (1:1,280) and MN (400) titers. he required mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, and vasopressors. the high titer occurred while he was in intensive care, 32 days after symptom onset. 2 patients received a laboratory diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection. 230 (33%) consented to serum sampling and were tested. 11 had a history of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection. healthcare workers who had a history of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection had ELISA-reactive serum samples after a median of 381 days (Q1 246 days, Q3 485 days) after infection. only 1 healthcare worker (participant no. 9) had a high MN titer (800) but she was not considered a candidate for plasma donation because of a previous pregnancy. exposed healthcare workers who had negative MERS-CoV r data from a self-administered survey question answered by 200 healthcare workers. data from a self-administered survey question answered by 199 healthcare workers. total of 196 patients with suspected or laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection were tested. 183 (88.8%) were hospitalized in the emergency department, 11 (5.8%) in the intensive care unit, and 2 (0.97%) in the medical wards. 6 (75%) of 8 patients had ELISA-reactive serum samples. 2 patients who had nonreactive IFA results also had nonreactive MN results. one of the 6 patients (no. 7) had high IFA (1:1,280) and MN (400) titers. the patients died before the test was repeated. a median of 34 days (Q1 34 days, Q3 34 days) after 2 patients received a laboratory diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection was negative. serum antibody to MERS-CoV was infrequently reactive by ELISA. reactivity may have been affected by timing of sample collection or severity of illness. one healthcare worker had high MN titers, but she did not meet clinical criteria for plasma donation. a short-lasting immune response may explain why negligible or low levels of MERS-CoV seroreactivity have been detected in persons at risk for the disease. a seroprevalence study conducted during December 2012\u2013December 2013 showed MERS-CoV antibodies in only 0.15% of the general population (n = 10,009) in all 13 provinces in Saudi Arabia (21). 74% of 150 camels from different parts of Saudi Arabia have antibodies to MERS-CoV by ELISA. prevalence of antibodies is higher in older camels (95%) further testing is needed to determine whether the antibodies in convalescent plasma are clinically effective against MERS-CoV infection. our findings also raise questions about whether naturally occurring infections and potential MERS-CoV vaccines will offer long-lasting immunity."}
