{"summary": "heterogeneity among individuals can be quantified by comparing the variability among individuals to that expected by chance. one approach is to estimate the effective reproductive number R eff (the average number of new infections resulting from an original infection) for a population. the importance in amplification, Aj, of each host group relative to its abundance is then Aj = (R 0,j/R 0)/Nj. to determine whether a host group is likely to be a superspreader at the nth percentile requires determining whether the observed value of Aj is unlikely given an expectation of Aj = 1 and the measurement error associated with estimating (R 0,j/R 0) and Nj. the fraction of the landscape of interest represented by that area is greater than the nth percentile of the appropriate ratio of distributions. the costeffectiveness of targeted control rests on the costs of identifying and controlling hotspots or key transmission individuals. the intensity of macroparasitic infections (eg worms per individual) generally follows a negative binomial distribution with high skew. a later study proposed the \u201c20/80\u201d rule and showed that 20% of hosts were responsible for at least 80% of transmission events. extreme cases of transmission heterogeneity have been referred to as superspreading events. a useful definition for a superspreading event is when an infected host causes a greater number of secondary infections than the nth percentile of the expected distribution of new infections. the powerful influence of rare events (or \u201cblack swans\u201d) drawn from the tail of probability distributions has been recognized in other aspects of ecology. a new research frontier in disease ecology involves identifying the relative contributions of host, pathogen, and environmental characteristics in transmission heterogeneity among individuals. factors such as genetic differences in host resistance or parasite virulence can lead to individual transmission heterogeneity. coinfections can reduce transmission potential as a result of crossimmunity and contactreducing behaviors of infected hosts. even more effective control is possible when individuals with potential for disproportionate transmission can be predicted before infecting others. many pathogens infect host species in which contact rates and pathogen transmissibility vary. interspecific variability in transmission is a function of host susceptibility, contact rates with vectors or other hosts, and host competence. robins may infect 24\u201371% of WNVinfected vectors at a site. hosts enhance the population of infected vectors, increasing infection risk for cooccurring host species. amplification hosts that make disproportionate contributions to communitywide disease transmission relative to their abundance may be considered \"superspreading species\" amplification hosts that make disproportionate contributions to communitywide disease transmission relative to their abundance may be considered \"superspreading species\" hotspots are often characterized by conditions that facilitate elevated pathogen survival. the bacteria that causes cholera can become concentrated on water hyacinths. this could lead to transmission hotspots in areas heavily invaded by water hyacinth. nutrient enrichment of water bodies associated with agricultural areas supports different aquatic plant communities that promote breeding by an efficient malaria vector. regional variability in host contact rates in settings such as daycare facilities, hospitals, markets, and farms can also create hotspots of disease. aggregation of children in schools enhances transmission of childhood diseases, such as measles. the relevant measure of transmission for habitat patches will depend on the management scenario and could include, for example, the number of farms infected by a single farm or the number of host infections that occur in spatially defined areas. new theory for understanding when to expect transmission heterogeneity will improve disease mitigation strategies. transmission variability across hosts may be more common among infections transmitted through vectors or direct hosttohost contact. there are no intermediate transmission steps (eg to other obligate host species) that would dilute the influence of variable contact rates, competence, or infectivity on overall transmission. most practical information about transmission heterogeneity from a management perspective is determining what measures may be useful for identifying the most infectious individuals, species, and locations so that they can be targeted before infecting others. identifying the most infectious hosts before they infect others offers a superior management strategy to post hoc analyses that detect such hosts. hypothetical contact network showing potential superspreaders (red circles) with higher than average connections to the rest of the network. red circles represent nodes (eg
