{"summary": "the Ras genes encode more than 100 proteins, collectively known as the Ras superfamily, which are involved in the regulation of proliferation, differentiation, cell adhesion and apoptosis of cells. some of these proteins are small G proteins that transducer signals from cell-surface receptors, such as growth factor receptors. some of these proteins are small G proteins that transducer signals from cell-surface receptors, ultimately affect mitogenic functions. computer-aided drug design is one of most effective methods in developing new drugs. many reports have indicated that computational method is a time-saving and effort-saving approach to discover new candidates. virtual screening (VS) has emerged as a powerful approach to complement the array of existing high-throughput screening technologies [14, 15]. IMB-1406 was found to have the highest CDOCKER energy and similar structural framework to the crystallized inhibitor (Compound 4) [23] of farnesyltransferase. the most active compound IMB-1406 and the Compound 4 are found to bind in the active pocket of farnesyltransferase receptor in a similar conformation. scheme 1. Synthesis of target compound IMB-1406 (Scheme 1). scheme 1. Synthesis of target compound IMB-1406 (Scheme 1). antitumor activity of IMB-1406 was first investigated for cytotoxic activity against a549 (lung adenocarcinoma), MCF-7 (breast cancer), DU145 (prostate carcinoma) and HepG2 (liver carcinoma) the compound was further evaluated for its in vitro anti-tumor activity against the aforementioned four human cancer cell lines by the MTT assay. effects of IMB-1406 on cell cycle of HepG2 cells were examined. pG2 cells were treated with indicated concentrations of IMB-1406 for 72 h. the percentages of HepG2 cells in the S phase are 28.17% (2 M), 36.96% (4 M) and 37.25% (8 M), respectively. the percentage of cell positive for PI and/or Annexin V-FITC are reported inside the quadrants. effects of IMB-1406 on mitochondrial membrane potential of HepG2 cells. s of IMB-1406 on the levels of Bax, Bcl-2 and caspase-3 Mitochondria play an essential role in cell death signal transduction. the mitochondria-dependent pathway is regulated by the Bcl-2 family of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins, which induce the permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane. caspase-3 is activated in a concentration-dependent manner after treatment with IMB-1406 at 2 M, 4 M and 8 M the most active compound IMB-1406 and the Compound 4 are found to bind in the active pocket of farnesyltransferase receptor in a similar conformation. the highest -CDOCKER_INTERACTION_ENERGY was 52.24 for IMB-1406 and that of Compound 4 was 57.22. scheme 1. Synthesis of target compound IMB-1406 (Scheme 1). treatment of ethambutol (EMB, 1) with tert-butyldimethylsilyl chloride (TBDMSCl) gave the desired bis-TBDMS-protected compound 2. antitumor activity For preliminary screening of antitumor activity, IMB-1406 was first investigated for its in vitro anti-tumor activity against the aforementioned four human cancer cell lines. the inhibition rate and IC50 values were compared with those of sunitinib, a multi-targeted receptor TK inhibitor [24]. IMB-1406 inhibits the growth of the cancer cells by inhibiting the cell cycle via S-phase arrest. apoptosis plays a central role in cancer treatment, since its induction in cancer cells is critical to a successful therapy. treatment of HepG2 cells with IMB-1406 for 72 h results in an increase of the apoptosis ratios from 8.9% (untreated vehicle control) to 17.15% (2 M), 35.40% (4 M) or 57.51% (8 M), suggesting that IMB-1406 is able to induce apoptotic cell death in HepG2 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. apoptotic morphology increases in a dose-dependent fashion. incubation with IMB-1406 increases the number of cells with collapsed mitochondrial membrane potentials. effects of IMB-1406 on levels of Bax, Bcl-2 and caspase-3 Mitochondria play an essential role in cell death signal transduction. IMB-1406 cells were treated with IMB-1406 at 2 M, 4 M and 8 M for 72 h. expression levels of Bax, Bcl-2 and caspase-3 were determined by western blot analysis. the synthesis of intermediate 2 To a solution of ethambutol dihydrochloride (1, 2.77g, 10 mmol) and Et3N (5.70 ml, 44 mmol) was added dropwise a solution of tert-butyldimthylsilyl chloride (3.30 g, 22 mmol) in anhydrous DCM (20 ml) at 0\u00b0C. after the addition, the mixture was stirred g, 0.37 mmol) in THF (5 ml) and 1M TBAF (in THF, 1.37 ml, 1.48 mmol) were allowed to react at room temperature for 10h. then the reaction mixture was concentrated and purified silica flash column chromatography (0\u201310% (v/v) MeOH in DCM). all of these cells were cultured in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C. the cells were incubated with medium containing MTT for 4 h. the formazan crystals were dissolved by agitating the plates at room temperature for 10 min. the absorbance was measured at 490 nm with a microplate reader. the RNA enzyme was added, the cells were placed at 37\u00b0C for 30 minutes. after digestion, PI was added for staining. the cells were placed in the dark at 4\u00b0C for 30 minutes. synthesis of intermediate 2 to a solution of ethambutol dihydrochloride (1, 2.77g, 10 mmol) and Et3N (5.70 ml, 44 mmol) was added dropwise a solution of tert-butyldimthylsilyl chloride (3.30 g, 22 mmol) in anhydrous DCM (20 ml) at 0\u00b0C. the solvent was removed in vacuo to yield solution of compound 4 (0.28 g, 0.37 mmol) in THF (5 ml) and 1M TBAF (in THF, 1.37 ml, 1.48 mmol) was added to a solution of 2 (1.30 g, 3 mmol) and 3 (200 mg, 0.5 mmol) in acetonitrile (10ml) mixture was reflux for overnight, after which the reaction mixture was poured into water (20 ml), and extracted with mitochondrial membrane potential detection kit, SDS-PAGE gel preparation kit and enhanced chemiluminescence kit were purchased from Nanjing KeyGen Biotech Co., Ltd. is Detection kit (KGA1024, KeyGEN, Nanjing, China) was used for cell staining and flow cytometry (Becton-Dickinson FACS Calibur) the percentage of apoptotic cells was determined using the manufacturer's instructions. a new compound (IMB-1406) was identified, synthesized and characterized by 1HNMR, 13CNMR and MS. the compound induces apoptosis in HepG2 cells by arresting the cell cycle at the S phase, altering anti- and pro-apoptotic proteins leading to mitochondrial dysfunction."}
