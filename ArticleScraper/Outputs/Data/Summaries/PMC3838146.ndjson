{"summary": "a novel human betacoronavirus was isolated from a sputum specimen. the virus was renamed the human betacoronavirus EMC/2012. the virus was renamed the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. TMPRSS2 is expressed in the epithelial cells of the human respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. TMPRSS2 enhances virus replication and syncytium formation during infection by SARS-CoV, HCoV-NL63, and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus. HeLa cells, HeLa cells constitutively expressing TMPRSS2 (HeLa-TMPRSS2 cells), Vero cells, and Vero cells constitutively expressing TMPRSS2 (Vero-TMPRSS2 cells) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Nissui) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Gibco-BRL) a real-time PCR assay was performed to ascertain the amount of newly synthesized subgenomic MERS-CoV RNA by using the primers and probes listed in Table 1.

TMPRSS2 expression and exogenous trypsin treatment on virus entry. cells were infected with MERS-CoV in the presence of camostat (10 M), EST (10 M), cathepsin B (CatB; 10 M), cathepsin K (CatK; 10 M), or cathepsin S (CatS; 10 M), then incubated for a further 5 h at 37\u00b0C. mERS-CoV cell entry was inhibited by 40-fold by cathepsin L and cathepsin K inhibitors. this suggests that MERS-CoV most likely uses cathepsin L for cell entry. results were obtained by using artificially constructed vero cells expressing TMPRSS2. o cells and unsusceptible HeLa cells served as the controls. mRNA expression levels were measured in human lungs by using real-time PCR. expression levels were compared to those in total RNA derived from human lung. the levels of the human DPP4 protein in the lung-derived cells were also compared by Western blotting. a 100-kDa band corresponding to DPP4 was clearly observed in Calu-3 cells. this band was detected at low levels in WI-38 and MRC-5. cells were infected with MERS-CoV in the presence of camostat (Camo; 10 M), EST (10 M), camostat plus EST (Camo+EST), or leupeptin (10 M) the concentration-dependent effects of serially diluted leupeptin or EST were tested in the three cell lines. HCoV-229E entry into MRC-5 and WI-38 cells was insensitive to inhibition by camostat, EST, or leupeptin. a much higher concentration of leupeptin is required to inhibit HCoV-229E entry (25); therefore, 100 M leupeptin was used, and the result was a 5.4-fold decrease in virus entry. inhibition of multistep growth of MERS-CoV and host cell death associated with cell-cell fusion was explored in MRC-5, WI-38, and Calu-3 cells. cell death was delayed by 2 or 5 days by treatment with camostat at a concentration of 10 or 100 M. DMSO-treated cells served as the negative control. bars and error bars indicate the means and the standard deviation from six independent samples. yncytium formation was clearly observed at 1 log10 TCID50. endoproteinase Arg-C specifically cleaves proteins at the carboxyl side of arginine residues. this result indicates that the lysine residues at the cleavage site in the viral S protein are a target for trypsin. Vero and Vero-TMPRSS2 cells were infected with serially diluted MERS-CoV in the absence of exogenous proteases. the titer of SARS-CoV in Vero-TMRPSS2 cells was 100-fold higher than that in Vero cells. 0.5 5 5.7 0.3 Vero-TMPRSS2 cells were inoculated with serially diluted MERS-CoV and incubated for 18 h. the culture medium was then used for titration. for each virus dilution, the virus titer was 1 or 2 log units higher than that in the parental Vero cell medium. the anti-VHCR peptide antibody also reacted with 180-kDa and 120-kDa bands in the cell lysates of both cell types. the 120-kDa band corresponds to the intact viral S protein. samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. the 180-kDa band was more pronounced in both the cell lysate and the culture medium of vero-TMPRSS2 cells at 4 and 3 log10 TCID50s than at 5 log10 TCID50s. the dramatic membrane fusion induced by MERS-CoV in vero-TMPRSS2 cells caused cytotoxicity at higher titers, thereby reducing S-protein production. a high titer (MOI = 10) or low titer (MOI = 0.0001) of MERS-CoV was adsorbed onto vero-TMPRSS2 cells on ice for 1 h. cells were then shifted to 37\u00b0C in the presence or absence of cycloheximide (100 g/ml), an inhibitor of protein translation. fusion affected all of the cells by 20 h. vero-TMPRSS2 cells were infected with MERS-CoV at a high titer (MOI = 10) or a low titer (MOI = 0.0001) for 1 h on ice. incubated at 37\u00b0C in the presence or absence of cycloheximide (100 g/ml) the size of syncytia in the presence or absence of camostat was quantified by counting the number of nuclei in fused cells. bars and error bars indicate the means and the standard deviation from eight independent syncytia. MERS-CoV entry into TMPRSS2 cells was 20-fold higher than that into Vero cells. supplemental trypsin in the culture medium enhanced virus entry into Vero cells by only 5-fold. camostat (10 M) impaired MERS-CoV entry by 15-fold. vero or vero-TMPRSS2 cells were infected with MERS-CoV in the presence of camostat (10 M), EST (10 M), or camostat plus EST. cells were then incubated for a further 5 h at 37\u00b0C. effects of cathepsin inhibitors or endosome-tropic inhibitors on virus entry. mERS-CoV cell entry was inhibited by 40-fold by cathepsin L and cathepsin K inhibitors. no significant suppression was observed by treatment with the cathepsin B or the cathepsin S inhibitor. results suggest that MERS-CoV most likely uses cathepsin L for cell entry. SS2, cathepsin L (CatL), SP-D, and GAPDH transcripts were not detected. expression levels were compared to those in total RNA derived from human lung. ND, transcripts were not detected. WI-38, MRC-5, and Calu-3 cells were infected with MERS-CoV. camostat (10 M) effectively inhibited virus entry into Calu-3 cells. only slight inhibition was obtained with EST (10 M) DMSO-treated cells served as the negative control. bars and error bars indicate the means and the standard deviation from six independent samples. HCoV-229E entry into MRC-5 or MRC-5 cells was insensitive to inhibition by camostat, EST, or leupeptin. cell lines were infected with HCoV-229E in the presence of camostat, EST, and camostat plus EST. camostat had no significant impact on the amount of viral RNA in the culture medium of the other two cell lines after 3 days. in these cells, 100 M camostat partially suppressed cell death, but 10 M camostat was not effective. in these cells, 100 M camostat partially suppressed cell death. medium of Calu-3 cells was similar for all conditions, including the highest dose of camostat employed (100 M) we assume that camostat activity was lost at 7 days because the drug dose dependently attenuated recovery of virus levels prior to this time point. large syncytia appeared in vero-TMPRSS2 cells at only 18 h after MERS-CoV infection. the use of vero-TMPRSS2 cells is recommended for MERS-CoV isolation. we previously reported that TMPRSS2-expressing cells are similar to bronchial epithelial cells in terms of virus entry and susceptibility to SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63 infection. mRNA expression levels of TMPRSS2, cathepsin L, and DPP4 were similar in Calu-3 cells and the human lung. TMPRSS2 or additional serine proteases inhibited by camostat may determine viral tropism and pathogenesis in the lung. a single camostat treatment was as efficacious as leupeptin or EST plus camostat."}
