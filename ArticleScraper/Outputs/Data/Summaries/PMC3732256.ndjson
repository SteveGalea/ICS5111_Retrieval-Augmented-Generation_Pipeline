{"summary": "the virus infects the epithelial cells of the small intestine. it causes severe mucosal atrophy and consequent malabsorption. PEDV is common and the cause of serious problems, particularly in pigs in Asia. the remaining part of the genome contains ORFs specifying structural and non-structural proteins. they are expressed via a 3\u2032-terminal nested set of subgenomic messenger RNAs. these mRNAs encode at least four structural proteins, three membrane anchored proteins called the spike (S), membrane (M) and envelope (E) protein, and the nucleocapsid (N) protein. recombinant progeny viruses against parental viruses were electroporated into PEDV (Stage 1) or mPEDV (Stage 2) infected cells. entry of coronaviruses into their host cells is mediated by the 200 kDa large S glycoprotein. PEDV is usually propagated in VERO cells. the first reverse genetic system for PEDV included two stages. one was the generation of the chimeric virus mPEDV, a PEDV derivative carrying spikes derived from the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), hence growing only in murine cells. pPEDV transfer vector contains the 5\u2032-proximal 605 nt fused to the 3\u2032 approximately 8 kilobases of the PEDV genome. all other vectors are derivatives thereof. red triangle indicates the T7 promoter in the transfer vectors. mPEDV could be inhibited by a MHV-S peptidic fusion inhibitor. mPEDV virus was used as a recipient virus to reintroduce the PEDV spike along with other genome modifications. a number of cell culture adapted viruses have each acquired during passaging an identical 51 nucleotide in-frame deletion in the ORF3 gene. we constructed a transfer vector (pPEDV-ORF3) from which the entire ORF3 gene was deleted. RT-PCR analysis confirmed the intended loss of the ORF3 gene from the viral genome. the successful deletion of the ORF3 gene from the viral genome demonstrated the feasibility of the mPEDV-based targeted RNA recombin VERO cells were infected with each recombinant PEDV (MOI = 0.01), washed after three hours and viral infectivity in the culture media was determined at different times p.i. by a quantal assay on VERO cells from which TCID50 values were calculated. we then explored the possibilities of expressing heterologous proteins from the PEDV genome by inserting reporter genes at different genomic positions. RT-PCR was performed covering the 1b-S junction (primers 5109/4535) or the S-M region (primers 4538/4977) using RNA templates isolated from wild-type PEDV, PEDV-Rluc, PEDV-ORF3/Rluc or PEDV-ORF3/GFP. VERO cells were infected with PEDV-Rluc at an MOI of 0.01 or 0.01. fluorescence images were taken at different times p.i. Nuclei of cells were stained with DAPI (blue) a rapid virus neutralization assay based on recombinant PEDVs expressing reporter proteins were mixed with subsequent dilutions of serum positive for PEDV antibodies. PEDV-ORF3/GFP and PEDV-ORF3/RLuc virus were preincubated with dilutions of serum obtained from an experimentally PEDV-infected pig. the experimental serum was able to neutralize PEDV infection as reflected by the reduction of GFP positive cells and luciferase activity. this type of assay is additionally preferred as it avoids subjectivity associated with scoring of cytopathic effects. similar recombination systems have been successfully developed for MHV and FIPV coronaviruses by the Masters and Rottier laboratories. the ability to manipulate the PEDV genome will be extremely valuable to study the molecular and biological features of PEDV infections. the function of the PEDV ORF3 protein remains enigmatic. the protein exhibits ion channel activity and modulates virus production. the 91-residue truncated protein still provides that function. the 91-residue truncated protein was shown to be N-glycosylated. the insertion of reporter genes like for GFP and luciferase will be very useful for the study of various molecular and virological aspects of PEDV infection. insertion of genes encoding foreign antigens opens avenues to the development of PEDV as a vaccine vector for protection against other relevant porcine pathogens. PEDV antibody-negative control serum was obtained from a newborn piglet deprived of colostrum. construction of pPEDV transfer vector and derivatives pPEDV vector A cDNA clone encompassing the 3\u2032-terminal 7,832 nt part of the PEDV genome starting within ORF1b was obtained by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) the location of primers is relative to the full genome sequence of the PEDV CV777 strain (GenBank accession No. AF353511). p-rPEDV vector A transfer vector was constructed in which the partially overlapping ORF1b and S gene were separated by introduction of a unique BamHI site. the stop codon of ORF1b was mutated to TAA to knock out the overlapping ATG start codon of the spike gene. the forward primer 5127 containing the BamHI site and a TRS (TAAAC) and the reverse primer 4815 containing a unique PacI site were used to ampli the forward primer 4814 (StyI site in overhang) and reverse primer 4924 (EagI site in overhang) were used to amplify the 3\u2032 end of the PEDV S gene and downstream sequences and cloned into the pTUMS plasmid. to create the p-mPEDV vector, the PEDV S gene in the p-rPEDV vector was replaced by the chimeric MHV-PEDV spike gene. the pPEDV-RLuc and pPEDV-ORF3/GFP transfer vector were excised from the pEGFP-N1 plasmid (Clontech) with enzymes NcoI and NotI. the identity of all generated transfer vectors was verified by sequencing. targeted RNA recombination was established for PEDV in a two-stage process. progeny virus in the culture supernatant was harvested and mPEDV recombinant virus was purified by two consecutive cycles of plaque purification on VERO cells. after 4\u20135 days of incubation at 37\u00b0C progeny virus in the culture supernatant was harvested by freeze-thawing and candidate recombinant viruses were purified. the cells were rinsed three times with PBS and stained with goat -rabbit FITC-conjugated and donkey--mouse Cy3 conjugated secondary antibodies.
