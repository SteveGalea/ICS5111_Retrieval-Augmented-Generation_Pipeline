{"summary": "RVs are classified into three species, RV-A, RV-B, and RV-C. the accepted divergence threshold for type assignment is over 13%, 12%, and 13% nucleotide (nt) distances in the VP1 coding region for RV species A, B, and C. the 5\u2032 end of the genome is covalently linked to the small viral protein VPg. polypeptide is cleaved co- and posttranslationally by the viral proteases 2Apro and 3Cpro. 2Apro mediates all other cleavages except for VP0, which likely is cleaved into VP2 and VP4 in an autocatalytic manner after capsid assembly. contemporary RV recombination occurring among circulating strains has been documented only twice in RV-A members. to date, contemporary RV recombination occurring among circulating strains has been documented only twice in RV-A members. the VP3-VP1 diamino acid cleavage site differed between the RV-B14 (E-G) and the other RV genomes used (Q-N) the QCpR16.11 plasmid contains a full RV-A16 genome in which an SfoI restriction site spanning codons 2 and 3 of the RV-A16 ORF was introduced using site-directed mutagenesis. and downstream tagged RV-A16 PCR products were fused together using the forward primers RV50, RV38, and RV99. the fusion PCR products were subcloned into a pCR2.1-TOPO TA vector. the different P1-2A regions were cloned into the QCpRV-A16 vector with SfoI-ClaI restriction sites. the resulting construct was named the RV-B14 SfoI 5\u2032UTR. the P1-2A region of the RV-A16 genome was amplified from the QCpRV-A16 plasmid using primers RV50 and RV169. the resulting PCR product was subcloned into a pCR2.1-TOPO TA vector before cloning the RV-A16 P1-2A region into the RV-B14 plasmid. regions are delimited by nucleotide positions. the crosses indicate the regions deleted for each construct. partially deleted RV genomes were created using restriction digestion. pRV-A39 plasmid was doubly digested with AflII and MluI. pWR3.26-RV-C11 plasmid was doubly digested with AflII and MluI. the resulting plasmid was digested with SnabI and SfoI. the RV-B14 plasmid was doubly digested with BamHI and self-ligated. ml1, 100 g of gentamicin ml1, 20 g of vancomycin ml1 and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. chimeric RVs resulting from transfection and cotransfection experiments were propagated in HeLa Ohio cells in McCoy's 5A medium. fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Light Diagnostics) was added to the cells for 45 min at 37\u00b0C in the dark. the cells then were washed three times with PBS and stained with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 5 min at room temperature. RNA was extracted from the infected cell supernatant, reverse transcribed, and PCR amplified over three genomic regions. a second round of PCR was run to narrow down the recombinant region. PCR products amplified with mixed primer combinations were sequenced. all other amino acid pairs (Q-G) cleaved by 3Cpro within the exchanged region are identical and not shown. the QCpR16.11 plasmid contains a full RV-A16 genome in which an SfoI restriction site spanning codons 2 and 3 of the RV-A16 ORF was introduced using site-directed mutagenesis. forward primers RV50, RV38, and RV99 were subcloned into a pCR2.1-TOPO TA vector. the different P1-2A regions were cloned into the QCpRV-A16 vector with SfoI-ClaI restriction sites. the same site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the RV-B14 plasmid to generate RV-B14[VP3-VP1QN] the resulting PCR product was fused with an adjacent downstream RV-B14 sequence that was PCR amplified from the QCpRV-A16 plasmid. the resulting PCR product was subcloned into a pCR2.1-TOPO TA vector before cloning the RV-A16 P1-2A region into the RV-B14 SfoI 5\u2032UTR vector with SfoI-XcmI restriction sites. oI restriction site used as a 5\u2032 sequence marker and five nucleotide substitutions used as a 3\u2032sequence marker in the RV-A16 del5\u2032UTR(1-434) 3\u2032 marker genome are indicated. the number on the right represents the percentage (first line) or fraction of cotransfected wells in which viable recombinant viruses could be recovered. partially deleted RV genomes were created using restriction digestion, fragment extraction, and self-ligation 16 3\u2032UTR sequence by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit) with the corresponding sequence of RV-A81 using primers RV87 and RV88. the modified pRV-A39 plasmid, named QCpRV-A39, was doubly digested with AflII and MluI. the resulting plasmid was digested with SnabI and SfoI and self-ligated. the resulting plasmid was doubly digested with BamHI and self-ligated. the RV-A81 ATCC strain and chimeric RVs resulting from transfection and cotransfection experiments were propagated in HeLa Ohio cells in McCoy's 5A medium. transfected cells and supernatants were collected and freeze-thawed three times. one-tenth (100 l) then was used to infect reconstituted human airway epithelia obtained from Epithelix. fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody was added to the cells for 45 min at 37\u00b0C in the dark. the cells then were washed three times with PBS and stained with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 5 min at room temperature. RNA was extracted using the NucliSens easyMAG magnetic beads system (bioM\u00e9rieux) RNA was extracted from the infected cell supernatant, reverse transcribed, and PCR amplified over three genomic regions. a second round of PCR was run to narrow down the recombinant region. PCR products containing mixed populations were subcloned in a TOPO PCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen) -B14 polyprotein (E-G) differed from that in the RV-A16 polyprotein (Q-N) versions of the RV-A16/-B14 and the RV-B14/-A16(P1-2A) genome, named RV-A16/-B14(P1-2A)[VP3-VP1QN] and RV-B14/-A16(P1-2A)[VP3-VP1QN] were generated. some isolated cells transfected with RV-B14/-A16(P1-2A)[VP3-VP1QN] and RV-B14/-C11(P1-2A) were IF positive. the absence of growth-competent RV-16/-B14 and RV-B14/-A16 interspecies chimera was confirmed by the absence of viral amplification after the passage of transfected cell supernatant in HeLa cells. RV RNA load measured using real-time RT-PCR. input is the RV RNA load present in the transfected HeLa cell inoculum. nonchimeric RV-A16 outcompetes intraspecies RV-A16/-A81(P1-2A) recombinant. infected cells and supernatants were collected at the indicated time posttransfection (P.T.) and 48 h after passage in new cells. input RNA and RNA extracted from supernatant collected 3 h and 48 h posttransfection and 48 h after passage in new cells. PCR product was digested with HindIII, whose restriction site is present in RV-A16 but absent from the chimeric construct. a 3\u2032UTR RV-A81 marker sequence was introduced at positions 7096, 7098, 7105, 7107, 7110, and 7113 of the RV-A16 del5\u2032UTR(1-434) genome. each of these constructs was either transfected individually or cotransfected with the complementary construct. recombination sites were not mapped due to the sequence identity of the two parental genomes. of RV-A39 del3\u2032(6124-end) RNAs did not result in viral replication. cotransfection of RV-A16 del5\u2032UTR(1-434) and RV-A39 del3\u2032(6124-end) RNAs resulted in replication-competent virus in 20 of 30 transfected wells. the proportion of wells with CPE after cotransfection were experiment dependent, with values ranging from 20% to 100%. viral stocks obtained from seven different recombinants contained between 1.01E+10 and 9.94E+10 RV RNA copies/ml versus 1.13E+10 and 7.52E+09 RV RNA copies/ml for RV-A16 and RV-A39 nonchimeric viruses. this suggests that intraspecies recombinants do not present major fitness impairment. results of competition between intraspecies recombinants identified two passages after cotransfection of 5\u2032-end-deleted RV-A16 and 3\u2032-end-deleted RV-A39 genomes. well identity is indicated in the left column, passage number on the upper left of each panel, and recombinant identity above each schematized recombination junction. PCR 2.51 specifically amplifies Rec8.1 and Rec14.1, PCR 3.51 amplifies Rec8 homologous 3A recombinant outcompeted the homologous 3D recombinant (well 16), and homologous VP4 recombinant outcompeted the homologous 3C recombinant (well A) all recombinants retained their sequence insertion up to passage 14 or 18 except for the VP1-2A recombinant, presenting a 444-nt sequence insertion. regions between these RV types and RV-A16 were 55.4% for RV-C11 and 54.9% for RV-B14. corresponding amino acid sequence identities were 51.6% and 49.8% respectively. none resulted in any growth-competent virus, as demonstrated by the absence of both a CPE and IF signal 7 days posttransfection. cleavage between VP1 and 2A is known to be performed by the 2A protease. the 3C diamino acid cleavage sites within the P1 region were conserved between RV-A16 and RV-C11. cleavage sites within the P1 region were conserved between RV-A16 and RV-C11 but not between RV-A16 and RV-B14. IF was performed 24 h posttransfection for the RV-A16/-C11(P1-2A) chimera. the intraspecies recombinant construct RV-A16/-A81(P1-2A) yielded infectious viral particles that could be successfully passaged. IF performed on cells transfected with interspecies RV-A16/-B14(P1-2A)[VP3-VP1EG] and RV-B14/-C11(P1-2A we assessed the viability of both the RV-C11 parental and chimeric RV-A16/-C11(P1-2A) genomes by passing the transfected HeLa cell lysate on reconstituted mucilAir human respiratory epithelia. the nonchimeric RV-A16 outcompetes the intraspecies RV-A16/-A81(P1-2A) recombinant. RV-A16 and RV-A16/A81(P1-2A) RNAs were transfected individually (A) or cotransfected in 1:1 (1 g each) and 0.1:1 [0.1 g of RV-A16 and 1 g of RV-A16/A81(P1-2A)] ratios. in panel A, infected cells and supernatants were collected at the indicated time posttransfection (P.T.) and 48 h after passage in new cells RV-A16 del5\u2032UTR(1-434) lacks the first 434 nucleotides of the 5\u2032UTR. a second replication-deficient construct was generated from RV-A16. this construct lacks the 3\u2032 end of 3C, the entire 3D, and the 3\u2032UTR. each of these constructs was either transfected individually or cotransfected. recombination sites were not mapped due to the sequence identity of the two parental genomes. an RV-A39 derivative, RV-A39 del3\u2032(6124-end) was constructed. the nucleotide and amino acid sequence identities between RV-A16 and RV-A39 over the P1, P2, and P3 regions were 74.8% and 82.9%, respectively. recombinants were most frequent at VP1-2A, 2C-3A, and 3C-3D junctions, as well as in the 3C and 3D coding sequences. all recombinants mapped to junctions were heterologous, with duplication of coding regions ranging from 24 to 444 nt. most intragenic recombinants were homologous, except for two recombinants. region origin highlighted in gray for RV-A39 and in white for RV-A16. asterisk indicates recombinants with sequence duplications within the protein coding sequence. competitive fitness of intraspecies recombinants derived from same cotransfection. combinants within the VP1-2A junction (Rec1.1, Rec8.1, Rec14.1, and Rec18.1) were fitter and able to outcompete recombinants with an imprecise 3C-3D junction (Rec1.2) or 2C-3A junction (Rec8.2) as well as heterologous or homologous recombinants within the 3D coding sequence (Rec14.2 and Rec18.2) in all cases, the fittest recombinants became RV-C11 del3\u2032(6642-6790) lacks 148 nt in the end of the 3D polymerase region. RV-B14del5\u2032(0-629) lacks the complete 5\u2032UTR. the nucleotide sequence identities over the P1, P2, and P3 regions between these RV types and RV-A16 were 55.4% for RV-C11 and 54.9% for RV-B14. l3\u2032(5274-end) without replication-competent virus. the parental deleted genomes were transfected individually to confirm their growth inability. the RV-A16 del5\u2032UTR(1-434) 3\u2032 marker was cotransfected with RV-A16 del3\u2032(5274-end) as an experimental positive control. four genomes in which the coding region for the capsid (VP4, VP2, VP3 and VP1) and 2A proteins were replaced with corresponding sequences of another RV genome were tested. only the intraspecies RV-A16/-A81(P1-2A) recombinant resulted in infectious viruses, and none of the interspecies chimeric constructs could be amplified. cotransfection of a 5\u2032UTR-deleted RV-A16 genome and a 3\u2032-deleted RV-A39 genome resulted in viable recombination in 20 of 30 assays. recombination occurring within a protein-coding sequence was homologous, except for that of two recombinants showing limited duplications. recombination in protein-coding sequences was precise at gene junctions. the 2Apro and 3Cpro were able to remove duplicated amino acid sequences. poliovirus and hepatitis c virus found that the duplicated sequences were lost after several multiplication cycles. intraspecies capsid recombinants may be documented in the future, particularly in VP4 and at the beginning of VP2. however, only two contemporary RV recombinants have been described to date. however, no viable interspecies recombinant could be recovered out of 120 attempts. recombination resulting in cre deletion would not yield viable progeny. 2A protease cleavage incompatibilities were avoided by exchanging 2A gene in addition to capsid genes, which originate from the same RV genome. ants retained a single and functional cre structure, although it is located in VP2 and VP1 for the RV-A/C chimera and RV-A/B chimera, respectively, instead of in 2A for the parental RV-A16 genome. the cre location does not affect picornavirus replication; thus, displacement of this element in interspecies P1-2A chimeras is unlikely to have prevented their viability."}
