{"summary": "broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (bNMAbs) have been isolated from HIV-1-infected subjects. bNMAbs targeting the same overall epitope on Env are derived from a limited number of germline VH and VL genes. bNMAbs targeting the same overall epitope on Env but isolated from distinct HIV-1+ subjects are derived from a limited number of germline VH and VL genes. anti-CD4-BS antibodies (b12 class) (27, 29, 31, 32) developed in vitro B cell stimulation assays to investigate interactions between Env immunogens and mutated (i.e., as isolated from HIV-1 infected subjects) and predicted germline BCR forms of known bNMAbs. b12 is derived from VH1-3, and the VRC01 class antibodies are derived from VH1-2 (27). recombinant Envs capable of similar binding to germline CH103 have not been identified (34). a few studies examined similar interactions between Env and bNMAbs that recognize epitopes outside the CD4-BS. recombinant Env proteins are poorly suited for engaging the predicted germline forms of bNAbs that target the CD4-BS. line BCRs of known anti-HIV-1 bNAbs investigated interactions between diverse Envs derived from clades A, B, and C. b12, PG9, and 447-52D, all of which target distinct epitopes. these three antibodies were isolated from distinct HIV-1-infected subjects. MAb b12 was isolated by phage display (42), MAb 447-52D was isolated through hybridoma formation (41) the remaining MAbs used here were isolated by VH and VL gene amplification from single B cells (11, 43, 44) the degree of mutation between the mutated and predicted germline sequences is expressed as the percent amino acid difference between the two sequences. the difference between our sequence and that of Pancera et al. is that the amino acid sequence of the lambda J region was that of the mutated antibody (VFGTGTKLTVL) but that of the predicted germline J gene is VFGGGTKLTVL (46). unlike PG9, the J regions of both the heavy and light chains are identical in the mutated and germline versions of 447-52D. the light chain sequences were synthesized by Genscript and cloned into the pTT5 vector. plasmids expressing the mutated and predicted germline BCR forms of b12 were recently reported. clade B SF162, SF162-V3, clade A Q168a2, Q259d2, Q461e2, Q769h5, and clade C 140c, 327c, 405c, 426c, 426c.N276D.N460D.N463D, 459c, 706c, 756c, and 823c proteins were expressed in 293F cells and purified as previously described. 426c, 459c, 706c, 756c, and 823c gp140 proteins were derived from viruses isolated during the first 3 months of infection from HIV-infected participants. a consensus Env amino acid sequence from several Env clones circulating in each subject at the time of sampling was created and used to express each of these Envs. the absorbance at 450 nM was measured using a Spectramax M2 plate reader. the background absorbance was calculated by taking the means plus standard deviations of the absorbance recorded with the mature antibody against the control protein, SF162 (PG9). anti-HIV-1 antibodies were added to cells expressing the BCRs of interest followed by the addition of anti-HIV-1 antibodies isolated from sera pooled from 50 infected HIV-1+ subjects that were labeled with phycoerythrin (PE) using the Zenon labeling kit. the degree of mutation between the mutated and predicted germline sequences is expressed as the percent amino acid difference between the two sequences. the difference between our sequence and that of Pancera et al. is that the amino acid sequence of the lambda J region was that of the mutated antibody (VFGTGTKLTVL) pTT5 vectors expressing soluble b12, PG9, 447-52D, and FI6 antibodies were synthesized by Genscript or IDT and cloned into the pTT5 vector sites. plasmids expressing the mutated and predicted germline BCR forms of b12 were recently reported. the antibody, furin, and F2A coding sequences were PCR amplified and cloned into the pTT5 vector using the EcoRI and NotI sites. the constant IgG splice variant cDNA containing the two exons encode the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of human IgG. Variants of QH0692 gp140 were made that lacked NLGS at positions 276 and 462 (QH0692.N276D.N462D) and 295, 301, and 332 (QH0692.T297A.T303A.T334A) using the QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) one hundred l/well of HIV Env proteins (0.5 g/ml in 0.1 M NaHCO3, pH 9.5) was adsorbed onto 96-well enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates overnight at room temperature. wells were washed 4 times in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) plus 0.02% Tween 20 (ELISA wash buffer) biolayerinterferometry (BLI) assays were performed on the Octet QKe instrument. IgGs (20 g/ml in PBS) were immobilized onto anti-human IgG FC capture biosensors. baseline interference was read for 1 min in kinetics buffer (KB; 1 PBS, 0.01% BSA, 0.02% Tween 20 and 0.005% NaN3) soluble predicted germline IgG forms of PG9 and 447-52D do not bind diverse recombinant Envs from diverse viruses. soluble predicted germline IgG forms of PG9 and 447-52D do not bind diverse recombinant Envs from diverse viruses. MAb PG9 bound to 61% of the recombinant Envs tested, including 7 out of 17 clade B Envs, 11 of 16 clade C Envs and 6 of 7 clade A Envs. PG9 also bound to the gp120 form of the recombinant A/E A244 Env.

Ca2+ flux response in B cells expressing mutated PG9 BCR following incubation with the indicated trimeric gp140 proteins. black arrow indicates the time of Env addition. some recombinant Envs are less efficient at triggering B cell activation through the PG9 BCR than the b12 BCR. recombinant Envs are stimulated with 30 g/ml recombinant trimeric HA (H5/VN/04) (A) or 30 g/ml recombinant trimeric SF162-K160N (B) flux in B cells expressing the mutated 447-52D BCR correlates with the EC50 binding values of the sIgG 447-52D. as was observed with the b12 BCR, the area under the Ca2+ flux curve correlate with the EC50 binding values of the sIgG 447-52D (Fig. 3D) we did, however, reproducibly detect very low-level QH0692 gp140 binding to the surface of B cells mutated 447-52D IgG to indicated gp140 trimers as measured by ELISA. results with mock transfected cells are also included. the clade B QH0692 Env has NLGS at position 276 in loop D and at position 462 in V5. removal of these two NLGS from QH0692 also improved binding of the mutated NIH45-46 sIgG. however, we did not detect binding of the predicted germline b12 sIgG to either the wild type or the altered QH0692 Env by ELISA. disruption of NLGS at positions 276 and 462 on QH0692 did not result in Ca2+ flux in B cells expressing the predicted germline b12 BCR. removal of NLGS within (N301) and proximal (N295 and N332) to the V3 loop of SF162 Env has been shown to increase the neutralization sensitivity of certain HIV-1 viruses by sIgG 447-52D (69). the soluble predicted germline IgG forms of PG9 and 447-52D do not bind diverse recombinant Envs from diverse viruses. the soluble predicted germline IgG forms of PG9 and 447-52D do not bind diverse recombinant Envs from diverse viruses. MAb PG9 bound to 61% of the recombinant Envs tested, including 7 out of 17 clade B Envs, 11 of 16 clade C Envs, and 6 of 7 clade A Envs. PG9 also bound to the gp120 form of the recombinant A/E A244

of membrane-anchored b12 (29) similar levels of mutated and predicted germline BCRs were expressed on the surface of transfected B cells. the trimeric SF162 and QH0692 gp140 Envs were able to mediate calcium flux in B cells expressing the mutated, but not the predicted, germline version of the b12 BCR (29). we verified that although surface-expressed BCRs can bind monomeric gp140 Env, trimeric gp140 Env is required for B cell activation in vitro. we investigated whether the mutated and predicted germline b12 ated or predicted germline version of the b12 BCR were incubated with the indicated trimeric gp140 proteins. the black arrow indicates the time of trimer addition. the clade B SF162 and QHO692 Envs were able to induce Ca2+ flux in B cells expressing the predicted b12 BCR. a positive correlation was observed between the half-maximum binding (EC50) of sIgG b12 to Env and the area under the Ca2+ flux curve. this is consistent with previous results demonstrating that HIV-1 Envs with higher binding affinities resulted in stronger Ca2+ flux (28). we did not detect binding of any of the above-mentioned clade B and C Envs to the predicted germline b12 BCR. a significantly weaker interaction was observed with the clade C Q168a2 Env. these five Envs also bound to the mutated PG9 BCR on the surface of B cells. the SF162-K160N Env showed binding comparable to that of the 327C, 706c, and ZM233M Envs. Ca2+ flux response in B cells expressing mutated PG9 BCR following incubation with the indicated trimeric gp140 proteins. the black arrow indicates the time of Env addition. as expected, Ca2+ flux was not recorded in cells expressing the mutated PG9 BCR when they were incubated with Envs that did not bind that receptor. mutated or predicted germline bNAbs are stimulated with 30 g/ml recombinant trimeric HA (H5/VN/04) (A) or 30 g/ml recombinant trimeric SF162-K160N (B) black arrows indicate the time of HA and Env addition. we were unable to detect binding of the predicted germline version of sIgG 447-52D to these trimeric recombinant Envs by ELISA. we did, however, reproducibly detect very low-level QH0692 gp140 binding to the surface of B cells expressing the predicted 447-52D germline BCR. however, none of the Envs tested here, including QH0692, triggered Ca2+ flux through the predicted germline 4 mutated 447-52D BCR incubated with indicated trimeric gp140 proteins. black arrow indicates time of Env addition. disruption of NLGS on Env ablates binding to predicted germline 447-52D. the clade B QH0692 Env has NLGS at position 276 in loop D and at position 462 in V5. removal of these two NLGS from QH0692 also improved the binding of the mutated NIH45-46 sIgG. however, we did not detect binding of the predicted germline b12 sIgG to either the wild type or the altered QH0692 Env. ruption of NLGS at positions 276 and 462 on QH0692 did not result in Ca2+ flux in B cells expressing the predicted germline b12 BCR. removal of NLGS within (N301) and proximal (N295 and N332) to the V3 loop of SF162 Env has been shown to increase the neutralization sensitivity of certain HIV-1 viruses by sIgG 447-52D (69). these results are in agreement with the observation that the mature and predicted germline FI6 antibodies bind equally well to this HA protein (43). recombinant Envs derived from clades A, B, and C fail to engage the germline soluble and BCR forms of three known neutralizing antibodies that target distinct conserved HIV-1 Env regions. the predicted germline versions of MAbs CH01 to CH04 bind the A244 gp120. the lack of germline PG9 binding to this same Env may reflect differences in the angle of approach to overlapping epitopes on Env. the absence of reactivity between Env and predicted germline forms of b12, PG9, and 447-52D antibodies raises the question of how these antibodies were developed during natural chronic HIV-1 infection. in those HIV-1+ subjects who develop broad neutralizing serum antibody responses upon infection, these responses only appear after 2 to 3 years of infection (1, 72). the PG9 epitope may be differentially presented on different Envs. only one PG9 Fab is capable of binding to a soluble clade A-derived SOSIP.664 trimer (73), while three PG9 antibodies can bind to one cell surface-expressed clade. the mature b12, VRC01, and NIH45-46 antibodies efficiently recognize the clade C 426c Env and the clade B QH0692 Env (28, 29) the removal of glycans that increased the binding of the mutated NIH45-46 and VRC01 to 426c did not improve the binding of the mature b12 to that Env. the presence of NLGS proximal to and within the V3 loop is required for germline 447-52D binding. the mutated 447-52D retains its ability to bind the QH0692 Env lacking NLGS in and around the V3 loop. the predicted germline forms of anti-V3 loop antibodies do not recognize Env and/or carbohydrates while the mutated antibodies do (24). expressing germline BCRs may be useful, as variations in glycan modifications carried out by different cell lines have been shown to affect the immunogenicity of Env (77)."}
