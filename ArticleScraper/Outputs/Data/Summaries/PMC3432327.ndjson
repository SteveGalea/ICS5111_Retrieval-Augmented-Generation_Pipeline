{"summary": "ARDS is due to an increase in the pulmonary alveolar-capillary membrane permeability causing lung edema rich in protein and consequently acute hypoxemic respiratory failure in genetically susceptible patients exposed to determined risk factors. the del/del genotype is associated with an age-dependent increase in odds of developing ARDS. patients with the del/del genotype and ARDS also have increased hazard of 60-day mortality (HR 1.54, 95% CI an overwhelming pulmonary inflammatory process is initiated leading to alveolar epithelial and vascular endothelial injury. injury to type II alveolar cells leads to an impairment of surfactant function with consequent collapse of the lungs. the presence of these modified risk factors may alert physicians to avoid secondary hospital exposures. implementation of ventilator associated pneumonia prevention bundles decreases the incidence of VAP and can lower the incidence of ARDS. physicians should order an arterial blood gas analysis and a chest radiograph to confirm the ALI/ARDS diagnosis. the Berlin definition reclassified ARDS as mild (PaO2/FIO2 300 or 39.99 Kpa), moderate (PaO2/FIO2 200 or 26.66 Kpa) and severe (PaO2/FIO2 200 or 26.66 Kpa) ICU team can program a more careful treatment plan according to disease severity. the Berlin definition shows better predictive validity for mortality compared to the AECC definition. the absolute value of the area under the receiver operating curve is still too small. the results of stepwise lung recruitment maneuvers and positive end-expiratory (PEEP) titration to keep the lungs open with minimal collapse can be assessed by computer tomography analysis. this strategy is aimed at opening up the lungs and keeping the lungs open as quickly and early as possible as postulated by Lachmann. nonaerated parenchyma decreased significantly from 53.6% (interquartile range (IQR: 42.5 to 62.4) to 12.7% (IQR: 4.9 to 24.2) (P 0.0001) after MRS. the potentially recruitable lung was estimated at 45% (IQR: 25 to 53), and hospital mortality was 32%. study analyzed 85 patients with ARDS graded into six findings. higher CT scores were associated with statistically significant decreases in organ-failure free days and ventilator free days. higher CT scores were associated with statistically significant decreases in organ-failure free days as well as ventilator free days. ARDS patient was ventilated with a PEEP = 24 cmH2O in the previous 48 hours. the patient was weaned from ventilator 3 days later. ARDS analyzed 40 patients randomly allocated to receive noninvasive ventilation. a close-monitored initial trial of noninvasive ventilation should be considered in most mild/moderate ARDS patients. early detection of NIV failure must be recognized. a prompt intubation and mechanical ventilation must be provided in order to avoid complications. V) curve associated with low tidal volume (VT = 6 mL/kg) compared to those ventilated with high VT (12 mL/kg) and low PEEP strategy. physiologic background supporting use of P-V curves to titrate PEEP lacks consistency nowadays. a randomized trial of 28 ARDS patients showed a better PaO2/FIO2 ratio, pulmonary compliance, and a shorter duration of mechanical ventilation. pressure support ventilation (PSV) along with sufficient PEEP levels should be used as early as possible in ARDS patients. the reason for the improvement in oxygenation obtained with PSV in ARDS has been challenged in the recent years. large randomized, controlled trials have consistently showed improvement in oxygenation without reduction in duration of mechanical ventilation or survival benefit. prone position can be an acceptable alternative to improve oxygenation in severe ARDS patients with arterial pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular dysfunction. in the pulmonary artery catheter population, 73% demonstrated an elevated transpulmonary gradient (TPG > 12 mmHg) patients with a persistently elevated TPG had a significantly greater mortality rate than patients with a TPG 12 mmHg (30% versus 19%; P = 0.02) in the pulmonary artery catheter population, 73% demonstrated an elevated transpulmonary gradient (TPG > 12 mmHg) a recent UK prospective, randomized, clinical trial (CESAR) showed a survival advantage in the ECMO group (63% for ECMO versus 47% for controls) CESAR trial also recommended transferring adult patients with severe but potentially reversible respiratory failure to a center with an ECMO-based management protocol to significantly improve survival without severe disability. iLA is aimed at improving extracorporeal gas exchange with a membrane integrated in a passive arteriovenous shunt. iLA serves as an extracorporeal assist to support mechanical ventilation by enabling low tidal volume and a reduced inspiratory plateau pressure. aning from HFOV/iLA was successful in 10 patients. the 30-day mortality rate was 43%, and hospital mortality rate was 57%. the best match among all available ventilatory techniques is still a matter of debate. a new workup for infection and change in antibiotic therapy could help improve the patient's evolution. a new workup for infection and change in antibiotic therapy could help improve the patient's evolution. the resolution of pulmonary edema should be implemented. increased extravascular lung water measured early in the course of ALI/ARDS was associated with a poor prognosis. a study analyzed the evolution of ARDS patients showed that unknown-site infection (adjusted hazard ratio) and multiple site infection (adjusted HR 1.63, 95% CI 1.13\u20132.35) were associated with increased mortality. vasopressors were used in 82.3% of our patients. continuous renal replacement therapy was used in 56.8% of our patients. APACHE II and day 1 SOFA score were not associated with hospital mortality. the effects of steroids in the late-stage fibrotic phase of ARDS were tested in a phase III study of the ARDS network. the study showed no mortality benefit in the treatment group, with a higher mortality in patients treated 14 days after onset. methylprednisolone therapy was associated with greater improvement in lung injury score (P = 0.003) and shorter duration of mechanical ventilation (P = 0.005) agonists were investigated in multicenter, prospective, randomized trials in their aerosolized presentation and intravenous presentation. both studies showed no mortality benefit and Beta-agonists are not recommended as part of therapy for patients with ARDS [96] a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial analyzed 272 patients with early acute lung injury allocated to either twice-daily enteral supplementation of n-3 fatty acids, -linolenic acid, and antioxidants if possible, get a computer tomography (improved diagnosis accuracy, permits differential diagnoses, and helps to set recruitment maneuvers and adequate PEEP levels) get nasal swab and inferior respiratory tract secretion for infection diagnosis or a BAL (infection diagnosis and proinflammatory mediators and procollagen III measurements) an early extensive clinical, laboratory, and imaging evaluation of \"at risk patients\" allows a correct diagnosis of ARDS, assessment of comorbidities, calculation of prognostic indices. rapid administration of antibiotics and resuscitative measures in case of sepsis and septic shock associated with ventilatory strategies."}
