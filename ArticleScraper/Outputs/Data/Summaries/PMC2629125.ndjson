{"summary": "Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a mosquito-borne zoonotic pathogen. it is distributed in sub-saharan africa and has caused large outbreaks in endemic areas. a small percentage of patients have an acute febrile myalgic syndrome. segment encodes N and NSs genes and uses an ambi-sense strategy to express the N and NSs proteins in infected cells. NSs mRNA encoding NSs protein is transcribed from the viral-sense (negative-sense) S segment. monocistronic M mRNA and L mRNA are transcribed from the viral-sense M and L segments, respectively. cytoplasmic NSs suppresses the transcription of host mRNAs by interacting with the p44 subunit of TFIIH, an essential transcriptional factor for cellular RNA polymerase II. NSs protein in the nucleus of infected cells most likely exerts these host transcriptional-suppressive activities, including that of IFN- promoter activation early in infection. RVFV lacking the NSs failed to replicate efficiently in ActD-treated cells. eIF2 phosphorylation suppressed the translation of RVFV lacking the NSs. further studies uncovered that RVFV NSs promoted PKR downregulation as early as 4 hours post-infection. titers of MP-12, rMP12-rLuc, and rMP12-C13type were measured by a plaque assay. the virus replication of rMP12-rLuc was significantly reduced in the presence of ActD. cells were mock-infected or independently infected with MP-12, rMP12-rLuc and rMP12-C13type. in the absence of ActD, the host protein synthesis of rMP12-rLuc and rMP12-C13type-infected cells was more efficient. the accumulation of N proteins of rMP12-rLuc and rMP12-C13type was slightly higher than that of MP-12. in contrast, ActD treatment did not inhibit N protein translation in MP-12-infected cells. a similar ActD-induced, moderate host protein synthesis inhibition also occurred in mock-infected cells. analysis of rLuc activities at 16 h.p.i. showed that NSs expression had little effect on rLuc activities in the absence of ActD. rLuc activities were clearly higher in the cells transfected with MP-12 NSs RNA transcripts or ZH501 NSs RNA transcripts. rMP12-rLuc virus titers in mock-transfected cells and CAT RNA-transfected cells were significantly lower in the presence of ActD compared 293 cells were infected with rMP12-rLuc at an moi of 2, transfected with in vitro\u2013synthesized RNA transcripts encoding CAT, MP-12 NSs, or ZH501 NSs. expression levels of N, NSs, CAT-myc-His, and -actin were determined by Western blotting. 293 cells were treated with in vitro-synthesized RNA transcripts encoding rLuc gene. cells were mock-treated or treated with ActD or -amanitin. the rLuc activities at 16 h post-transfection were slightly increased in the cells treated with ActD or -amanitin. ActD-treatment reduced the rLuc activities in cells infected with rMP12-rLuc alone. co-infection of MP-12 resulted in the reduction of both rLuc activities (Figure 3A) and the amounts of rLuc mRNA (Figure 3B, lane 4) in the absence of ActD. rLuc mRNA using RNA probe specific to N mRNA and the antiviral-sense S-segment (N antisense) or rLuc mRNA (rLuc antisense) the data are the representative of three independent experiments. the status of eIF2 phosphorylation in infected cells. rMP12-rLuc-infected cells in absence of transcription inhibitor found low levels of eIF2 phosphorylation from 8 to 24 h.p.i. and an efficient accumulation of N protein at 8 to 16 h.p.i. the mechanism of reduction in the abundance of phosphorylated eIF2 at 24 h.p.i. in the presence of ActD or -amanitin is unknown. veroE6 cells were mock-infected (M) or infected with rMP12-rLuc or MP-12 at an moi of 3, then immediately treated with ActD (5 g/ml) or -amanitin (50 g/ml), or left untreated (No drug) samples were harvested at the indicated time points post-infection for Western blot analysis or virus titration. phosphorylated eIF2 in rMP12-rLuc-infected cells was due to induction of apoptosis. PKR exerts a critical role in phosphorylation in infected cells. rMP12-PKRE7 expresses dominant-negative form of PKR, PKRE7. veroE6 cells were mock-infected or independently infected with rMP12-rLuc, rMP12-PKRE7 and MP-12 at an moi of 3. rMP12-rLuc replication in the presence of ActD or -amanitin induced eIF2 phosphorylation, resulted in reduced virus replication. cells were immediately treated with 5 g/ml of ActD (Act) or 50 g/ml of -amanitin (Ama) or were untreated. cell extracts were prepared at 16 h.p.i. for Western blot analysis (B,E) total eIF2, phosphorylated eIF2 and -actin in mock-infected cells (Mock), MP-12 infected cells, and rMP12-rLuc\u2013infected cells in the presence of 5 g/ml of ActD (Act), 50 g/ml of -amanitin (Ama) to further confirm these data, viral protein accumulation and replication were analyzed in wt mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF cells) 293 cells were mock-infected or infected with rMP12-NSs-Flag carrying flag-tagged NSs. 293 cells were transfected with in vitro-synthesized RNA transcripts encoding NSs. dsRNA bound to PKRE7 was poorly bound to NSs from rMP12-NSs-Flag-infected cells. 293 cells were mock-infected or infected with rMP12-rLuc-Flag, rMP12-NSs-Flag, or rMP12-rLuc-PKRE7 at an moi of 3. at 16 h.p.i. or 16 h post-transfection, cytoplasmic lysates (L) were incubated with poly C (pC) beads or poly IC (pIC) beads. a cytoplasmic fraction was collected at 16 h.p.i. and the IP-kinase assay of PKR was performed as described in Materials and Methods. a part of samples was used for Western blot analysis by using anti-PKR monoclonal antibody to show the abundance of immunoprecipitated PKR. 293 cells were infected with rMP12-NSs-Flag, rMP12-rLuc-Flag or we noted an efficient accumulation of rMP12-rLuc N mRNA at 8 h.p.i. in the presence of ActD. this efficient rMP12-rLuc replication probably occurred prior to 8 h.p.i. in the presence of ActD. this efficient rMP12-rLuc replication probably occurred prior to 8 h.p.i. in the presence of ActD. 293 cells were mock-infected or infected with rMP12-NSs-Flag, rMP12-rLuc-Flag or rMP12-PKRE7, treated with ActD. cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of cell extracts were prepared at 16 h.p.i. Western blot analyses showed the presence of RVFV NSs both in the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions. 293 cells were mock-transfected (M) or infected with rMP12-rLuc at an moi of 3. cells were mock-transfected (M) or transfected with in vitro\u2013synthesized RNA transcripts encoding rLuc (rLuc) or NSs. cells were then treated with 5 g/ml of ActD. 293 cells were mock-transfected or transfected with pcDNA3.1-Myc-PKRK296R. cells were then mock-treated or treated with 100 g/ml of puromycin. abundance of PKR and viral proteins were analyzed by Western blotting. whole-cell lysates were collected at 2, 4, 6, and 8 h.p.i. anti-PKR antibody, anti-NSs antibody, and anti\u2013actin antibody were used to detect PKR, NSs, and -actin, respectively (F and G). data are representative of two to three independent experiments (A\u2013G). the expression levels of PKR mRNA were examined by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. the relative expression levels of PKR mRNA were significantly increased in cells that were transfected with rLuc RNA transcripts or NSs RNA transcripts both in the absence and presence of ActD. NSs expression did not promote the degradation of PKR mRNA. treatment of 293 cells with puromycin for 16 h decreased the abundance of PKR only slightly. it is highly unlikely that putative NSs-induced translational inhibition was the main reason for the reduction in PKR abundance. we then performed pulse-chase experiments to know whether NSs expression promoted PKR degradation. radiolabelled myc-tagged PKR was clearly reduced in rLuc-expressing cells. the amount of radiolabelled PKR was increased slightly in rLuc-expressing cells. NSs expression reduced the abundance of myc-tagged PKR that had been radiolabelled prior to NSs expression. NSs promoted PKR downregulation by the degradation through the proteasome pathway. treatment of G6983 did not inhibit the NSs-mediated PKR downregulation. a substantial reduction of PKR abundance occurred as early as 4 h.p.i. RVFV lacking the NSs undergoes poor viral protein synthesis and viral replication in ActD-treated cells. we investigated the effect of ActD, a host transcriptional inhibitor, on the replication of MP-12 lacking the NSs gene in IFN-incompetent cells. rMP12-rLuc was immediately treated with ActD (5 g/ml) or untreated. the virus replication of rMP12-rLuc was significantly reduced in the presence of ActD. data are representative of three independent experiments. veroE6 cells were mock-infected or independently infected with MP-12, rMP12-rLuc and rMP12-C13type. the latter of which lacks approximately 70% of the NSs ORF. NSs-mediated transcriptional suppression occurred only in MP-12-infected cells. western blot analysis of cell extracts at 16 h.p.i. showed that ActD treatment strongly inhibited N protein accumulation in rMP12-rLuc-infected cells and rMP12-C13type-infected cells. NSs protein expression promotes viral replication in rMP12-rLuc\u2013infected cells in the presence of ActD. rMP12-rLuc virus titers in mock-transfected cells and CAT RNA-transfected cells were significantly lower in the presence of ActD compared to the ActD-untreated cells. NSs protein expression increased the accumulation of rMP12-rLuc N protein in the presence of ActD. the data were presented as mean+/standard deviation of three independent experiments. the expression levels of N, NSs, CAT-myc-His, and -actin were determined by Western blotting using anti-RVFV antibody (a-RVFV), anti-NSs antibody (a-NSs), anti-myc antibody (a-Myc), and anti\u2013actin antibody (a--actin), respectively. cells treated with either ActD or -amanitin showed active host translation activities in the presence of either ActD or -amanitin. NSs expression altered the cellular environment from one that was translationally inactive to one translationally active. rMP12-rLuc was infected at an moi. of 2, while MP-12 was infected at moi. of 0.1 or 1. MP-12 co-infection did not reduce the abundance of the viral-sense rMP-12-rLuc S segment in the presence of ActD. but it caused the reduction of rLuc mRNA abundance. rLuc activities are presented as mean+/standard deviation of three independent experiments. eIF2-GDP is released from the ribosome and undergoes a GTP exchange reaction catalyzed by binding with eIF2B. the resultant eIF2-GTP is recycled for the next round of translation initiation. phosphorylation status of eIF2 plays a critical role in translational control. the mechanism of reduction in the abundance of the phosphorylated eIF2 at 24 h.p.i. in the presence of ActD or -amanitin is unknown. a strong correlation was seen between an increase in eIF2 phosphorylation and the decrease in both N protein accumulation and infectious virus production. Western blot analyses of RVFV N protein, phosphorylated eIF2 and total eIF2 at various times post-infection. the relative abundance of phosphorylated eIF2 normalized to total eIF2 at 0 h.p.i is represented as 100%. PKR exerts a critical role in eIF2 phosphorylation in rMP12-rLuc-infected cells treated with ActD or -amanitin. a recombinant MP-12, rMP12-PKRE7, expresses a dominant-negative form of PKR, PKRE7. the virally encoded PKRE7 in rMP12-PKRE7-infected cells would interfere with the PKR rMP12-rLuc replication in the presence of ActD or -amanitin induced eIF2 phosphorylation, resulted in reduced virus replication. efficient N protein accumulation and efficient virus replication occurred in both MP-12-infected cells and rMP12-PKRE7-infected cells in the presence of ActD- or -amanitin. Western blot analysis shows accumulation of eIF2, phosphorylated eIF2, N protein, NSs protein, Flag-PKRE7, and -actin in infected veroE6 cells. relative abundance of phosphorylated eIF2 and total eIF2 represents 100%. MP-12 efficiently replicated in both wt MEF and Pkr0/0 MEF cells. rMP12-rLuc replication was not as efficient as MP-12 in wt MEF cells. accumulation of phosphorylated eIF2 did not occur in cells infected with rMP12-rLuc in presence of transcriptional inhibitors. 293 cells were transfected with in vitro-synthesized RNA transcripts encoding NSs. dsRNA bound to PKRE7 was poorly bound to NSs from rMP12-NSs-Flag-infected cells and that from the NSs-expressing cells. NSs did not suppress PKR activation by its binding to dsRNA. cytoplasmic lysates (L) were incubated with poly C (pC) beads or poly IC beads. dsRNA binding activity of the NSs was analyzed by Western blotting. 293 cells infected with rMP12-rLuc or MP-12 at an moi of 3. rMP12-rLuc-Flag was immunoprecipitated by anti-human PKR antibody. the PKR bound to the protein A beads was subjected to an immunoprecipitation (IP)-kinase assay by using [-32P]ATP. the abundance of PKR could affect the results of the IP-kinase assay. immunoprecipitated PKR from rMP12-rLuc-Flag-infected cells was phosphorylated both in the presence and absence of ActD. PKR phosphorylation did not occur in mock-infected cells or cells infected with rMP12-NSs-Flag or rMP12-PKRE7. 293 cells were mock-infected (Mock) or independently infected with rMP12-NSs-Flag, rMP12-rLuc-Flag, and rMP12-PKRE7 at an moi of 3. the PKR downregulation also occurred in MP-12-infected VeroE6 cells and in MRC-5 cells that were infected with the wt ZH501 strain of RVFV. 293 cells were mock-transfected or transfected with in vitro\u2013synthesized RNA transcripts encoding NSs or rLuc. cells were mock-treated or treated with 5 g/ml of ActD. total RNA was harvested at 8 h post-transfection, and analyzed by real-time PCR. pcDNA3.1-Myc-PKRK296R was immunoprecipitated by anti-myc monoclonal antibody. 293 cells were mock-infected or infected with rMP12-rLuc or MP-12. at 8 h post\u2013RNA transfection, cells were harvested (8 h) 293 cells were mock-transfected or transfected with in vitro-synthesized RNA transcripts encoding NSs or rLuc. the cells were mock-treated or treated with ActD. NSs expression did not promote degradation of PKR mRNA. 293 cells were mock-infected, infected with MP-12, or transfected with in vitro-synthesized RNA transcripts encoding NSs. puromycin treatment completely abolished the synthesis of N and NSs proteins in MP-12-infected cells. it is highly unlikely that putative NSs-mediated translational inhibition was the main reason for the reduction. expression of wild-type PKR was not used due to its strong host translation suppression effects. 293 cells were mock-transfected or transfected with pcDNA3.1-Myc-PKRK296R, a plasmid encoding PKRK296R under cytomegalovirus promoter. cells were radiolabelled with [35S] methionine/cycteine between 14 and 16 h post\u2013DNA transfection. 293 cells were infected with rMP12-rLuc or MP-12. rMP12-rLuc replication did not induce PKR downregulation. treatment of MP-12-infected cells with proteasome inhibitors suppressed PKR downregulation. whole-cell extracts were prepared at 2, 4, 6 and 8 h.p.i. from MP-12-infected 293 cells. a substantial reduction of PKR abundance occurred as early as 4 h.p.i. in the absence of proteasome inhibitor, a substantial reduction of PKR abundance occurred as early as 4 h.p.i. the NSs protein was essential for efficient virus replication in the presence of ActD or -amanitin. the replication of RVFV lacking the NSs gene induced an accumulation of phosphorylated eIF2. the accumulation of phosphorylated eIF2 in the presence of transcriptional inhibitors did not occur in veroE6 cells that were infected with RVFV expressing a dominant-negative form of PKR. the NSs protein promotes PKR downregulation as early as 4 h.p.i. and prevents eIF2 phosphorylation to secure the translation of viral mRNAs and efficient virus replication. in RVFV-infected cells, the NSs establishes general transcriptional suppression at a later stage of infection. some of the host pathogen-recognition receptors recognize virus-specific signals, e.g., viral RNAs in the virus particles or viral dsRNAs in the cell debris from infected cells. the reduction in PKR abundance occurred as early as 4 h.p.i. rMP12-rLuc replication in the absence of transcriptional suppressor induced only low levels of eIF2 phosphorylation. however, a significant accumulation of phosphorylated eIF2 occurred only in cells in which replication of RVFV lacking NSs was combined with the treatment with transcriptional inhibitors. transcription inhibitors would prevent GADD34 upregulation and subsequent eIF2 dephosphorylation, causing accumulation of phosphorylated eIF2. other possible mechanisms relate to the failure to suppress the PKR function. poliovirus is known to promote PKR degradation in infected cells [60],[61]. only RVFV NSs protein was probably required for PKR downregulation. phosphorylation of PKR was not essential for NSs-mediated PKR downregulation. expression of NSs alone resulted in a reduction in the amount of PKR. NSs-induced translational inhibition was not a main reason for the reduction in the abundance of PKR. NSs expression reduced the abundance of radiolabelled myc-tagged PKR. treatment of MP-12-infected cells with a PKC inhibitor, G6983, did not inhibit NSs-mediated PKR downregulation. the NSs protein was essential for efficient virus replication in the presence of ActD or -amanitin. the replication of RVFV lacking the NSs gene in the presence of a transcription inhibitor induced an accumulation of phosphorylated eIF2. a combination of RVFV replication and NSs-mediated host mRNA transcriptional suppression possibly induces PKR activation and subsequent eIF2 phosphorylation. the NSs protein promotes PKR downregulation as early as 4 h.p.i., and prevents eIF2 phosphorylation to secure the translation of viral mRNAs and efficient virus replication. NSs suppresses IFN- mRNA transcription early in the course of infection in cultured cells. some of the host pathogen-recognition receptors recognize virus-specific signals, e.g., viral RNAs in the virus particles or viral dsRNAs in the cell debris from infected cells. rMP12-rLuc replication in the cells treated with ActD or -amanitin promoted the accumulation of the phosphorylated eIF2. rMP12-rLuc replication in the absence of transcriptional suppressor induced only low levels of eIF2 phosphorylation. however, rMP12-rLuc replication in the absence of transcriptional suppressor induced only low levels of phosphorylation. rMP12-rLuc replication in cells treated with ActD induced PKR activation. transcription inhibitors would prevent GADD34 upregulation and subsequent eIF2 dephosphorylation, causing an accumulation of phosphorylated eIF2. other possible mechanisms relate to failure to suppress the PKR function. phosphorylated eIF2 accumulation occurred around 8 h.p.i. in rMP-12-rLuc-infected cells in the presence of ActD or -amanitin. eIF2 and PKR are highly activated in poliovirus-infected cells before PKR downregulation occurs. NSs-induced PKR downregulation occurred as early as 4 h.p.i. of MP-12. NSs-induced PKR downregulation occurred as early as 4 h.p.i. of MP-12. NSs-induced PKR downregulation occurred as early as 4 h.p.i. of MP-12. treatment of MP-12-infected cells with MG132 and lactacystin moderately reduced the accumulation of NSs. MG132-induced moderate translational suppression affected the NSs-induced PKR degradation in MG132-treated cells. further studies are required to elucidate the mechanism of PKR downregulation mediated by RVFV NSs. cells were treated with MG132 (Sigma) at 10 M or lactacystin (Sigma) at 50 M. to suppress PKC activity, cells were treated with a general PKC inhibitor, G6983 (Calbiochem) at 100 nM immediately after infection with rMP12-rLuc or MP-12. pcDNA3.1-myc-PKR296R was recovered as described previously. subconfluent monolayers of BHK/T7-9 cells were co-transfected with an S-genome RNA expression plasmid. at 5 days post-transfection, the culture supernatants were collected, clarified and then inoculated into veroE6 cells. one microgram of in vitro-synthesized RNA transcripts was transfected into 293 cells in a 12-well plate with a transIT-mRNA Transfection kit. the cells were infected with a series of diluted virus samples in 400 l. after 1 h adsorption at 37\u00b0C, we removed the inocula and added 2 ml of MEM containing 0.6% noble agar. 293 cells were mock-infected or infected with recombinant MP-12 at an moi of 3. cytoplasmic fraction was collected after centrifugation at 10,000g for 5 min. washed beads were resuspended in 2 kinase buffer containing 30 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4; 2 mM dithiothreitol; 2 mM MgCl2; proteasome inhibitor cocktail (Roche); and 10 Ci of [-32P] ATP. the suspension (20 l) was incubated at 30\u00b0C for 20 min, and then 2 SDS sample buffer was added to terminate the reaction 293 cells were mock-treated or transfected with pcDNA3.1-Myc-PKRK296R. they were labelled with trans[35S]label metabolic reagent between 14 and 16 h post\u2013DNA transfection. cells were washed, and incubated for 8 h in the presence of 2 mM methionine/cysteine. se assay was performed on a Renilla Luciferase Assay System. total RNA was harvested by Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and Northern blot was performed as described previously. real-time PCR was performed with 40 ng cDNA for both target gene and endogenous control. the cycling parameters for real-time PCR were: UNG activation at 50\u00b0C for 2 min, ampliTaq activation at 95\u00b0C for 10 min, denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 15 sec, and annealing/extension at 60\u00b0C for 1 min (repeat 40 times) on ABI7000. inant MP-12 [19] were used for the experiments, and infectivity was assessed by a plaque assay. cells were treated with transcriptional inhibitors, ActD (Sigma) (5 g/ml) or -amanitin (Sigma) (50 g/ml) to induce the inhibition of proteasome function. PKR ORF carrying a point mutation at K296R and the N-terminal myc tag was cloned between KpnI and XhoI of pcDNA3.1myc-His (Invitrogen) pcDNA3.1-myc-His (invitrogen) was cloned downstream of the T7 promoter between the Kpn I and Xho I sites of the plasmid. the rLuc ORF in pRL-SV40 plasmid (Promega Corporation) was inserted downstream of the promoter. one microgram of in vitro-synthesized RNA transcripts was transfected into 293 cells in a 12-well plate with a TransIT-mRNA Transfection kit. after 1 h adsorption at 37\u00b0C, we added 2 ml of MEM containing 0.6% noble agar, 5% FBS and anti-eIF2 (#9722, Cell Signaling Tech.); anti-flag M2 (F3165, Sigma); anti-PKR (#3072, Cell Signaling Tech.); anti-Histone H1 (sc-8030, Santa Cruz Biotech.); anti\u2013c-Myc (sc-40, Santa Cruz Biotech.); and anti\u2013actin (sc-1616, Santa Cruz Biotech.) washed beads were resuspended in buffer-B containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6; 100 mM KCl; 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol; 1% Triton X-100; 0.1 mM EDTA; proteasome inhibitor cocktail (Roche); and 20% glycerol. the suspension (20 l) was incubated at 30\u00b0C for 20 min, and then 2 SDS sample buffer was added 293 cells were mock-treated or transfected with pcDNA3.1-Myc-PKRK296R. the gel was dried and exposed to X-ray film overnight at 80\u00b0C. in some samples, cell extracts were prepared with chase using a lysis buffer. luciferase assay was performed on a Renilla Luciferase assay system. total RNA was harvested by Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and Northern blot was performed as described previously. biosystems made-to-order 20 assay mix of primers and TaqMan MGB probes (FAM dye-labled) for target gene PKR (Applied Biosystems: assay ID#: Hs01091592_m1) and pre-developed an 18S rRNA (FAM-dye labelled probe) TaqMan assay reagent (Applied Biosystems: 4370074) for endogenous control. the cytoplasmic lysates were loaded onto a 10\u201350% linear sucrose gradient containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 5 mM MgCl2; 100 mM KCl; 0.5 mM dithiothreitol; 100 g/ml cycloheximide. the gradients were centrifuged at 38,000 rpm for 3 h at 4\u00b0C using a Beckman SW cell extracts and culture supernatants were harvested at 16 h.p.i.
