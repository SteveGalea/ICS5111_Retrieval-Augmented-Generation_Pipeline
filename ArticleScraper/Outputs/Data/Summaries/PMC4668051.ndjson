{"summary": "emerging diseases are likely to be zoonotic, such as the Ebola outbreak of 2013\u20132014 and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus of 2012 and 2014 [3\u20135]. marine mammal strandings are an important resource for zoonotic disease surveillance Marine mammals are susceptible to strandings. stranded animals can provide an ideal source of information for identification of emerging infectious diseases in marine mammal populations. stranded harbor seals have not been the only marine mammals affected by morbillivirus. strandings of pinnipeds and cetaceans has led to the discovery of four new morbillivirus types. for the first time, we looked at the viral and microbial community present in the brain tissue of harbor seals. we targeted both DNA/RNA viruses to identify the possible viral pathogens in this stranding event. we also looked at microbial RNA to identify opportunistic or secondary bacterial infections. stranded animals can provide an ideal source of information for identification of emerging infectious diseases in marine mammal populations. stranded harbor seals have not been the only marine mammals affected by morbillivirus. strandings of pinnipeds and cetaceans has led to the discovery of four new morbillivirus types (PDV, CMV, CDV, and MSMV) harbor seals had abnormalities in the brain that may have been caused by an unknown virus, or an abiotic source. as a comparative group, seven other harbor seals with known causes of death were sampled. we targeted both DNA/RNA viruses to identify possible viral pathogens in this stranding event. PhV-1 = Phocine herpes virus -1. Age range is as follows: Pup 1month, weaner 1\u201312 months, and adult > 3 years. sample ID Date of Stranding Date of Death Date of Necropsy Cause of Death Age Sex Tissue UCD1 4/8/09 7/1/09 7/2/09 Unknown Weaner M Cerebrum back UCD2 4/9/09 7/26/09 7/29/09 Unknown Weaner F Cer ophebitis, septicemia and PhV-1 Pup F Cerebrum front/back veterinarians and staff at the MMC determined that seven of the stranded harbor seals died from the same yet unknown cause of disease. we will refer to this subset of animals as the \u201cunknown cause of death\u201d (UCD) supernatant was transferred to a new tube and 0.2mL of chloroform, for every 1 mL of Trizol, was added to the supernatant. equal amounts of 100% ethanol were added to samples and then loaded on an RNeasy kit (Qiagen, CA) to remove host DNA, 2U of Turbo DNase (Life Technologies, CA) was added to samples for a 9 hr digest. a computational normalization program was used to remove over-represented sequences to provide a more precise method for analyzing lower abundant viral and microbial sequences. a computational normalization program was used to remove over-represented sequences to provide a more precise method for analyzing lower abundant viral and microbial sequences within the dataset. sequences from sample UCD6 that aligned to Coxiella burnetii were imported into Geneious 9.0.1 Beta [30] to gain information of coverage for each base position across the 2.0 Mb genome (AE016828.1) DESeq2 uses a negative binomial distribution model and the Wald test for differential expression. taxon absolute counts were considered significant if the model yielded an FDR adjusted p-value 0.05. brain tissue samples from stranded animals were either part of the cerebellum or the cerebrum. these individuals ranged in age from pups (1 month, n = 3) to weaners ( 1 year, n = 10), and one adult (> 3 years). com1 and com2 where the date of death was unavailable. unknown weaner F Cerebrum front Comparative1 12/22/08 unknown 12/23/08 Congested blood vessels in the meninges Adult F Cerebrum front Comparative2 9/7/09 unknown 9/8/09 Extensive parasitism in multiple organs Weaner F Brain tissue unknown Comparative3 9/17/10 5/2/10 5/3/10 PhV-1 Weaner M Cerebrum front Comparative4 4/28/10 4/28/10 4/30/10 Metabol the cause of death varied for the other seven harbor seals. three of the samples from the comparative group were also diagnosed with PhV-1 by PCR. RNA was submitted to the CGRB core facility for quality control analysis using the Bioanalyzer 2100 HS- RNA Chip (Agilent technologies, CA) all RNA passed quality control and was converted to cDNA using superscript II Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies, CA) libraries were prepared with the TruSeq paired end cluster kit v.3 (Illumina, CA) Viral taxonomy was identified using NCBI GI and taxonomy ID database, NCBI\u2019s taxonomy tree, and python scripts (S1 Script and S2 Script) potential false positives were also avoided by removing short retrovirus-like similarities (100bp) from the analysis. all sequences from sample UCD6 were aligned using bowtie2 to plasmid pQpH1. phylogenetic analysis A phylogenetic tree of harbor seal associated Coxiella sp. was constructed using the 16S rRNA gene. sequences from sample UCD6 aligned to Coxiella burnetii were imported into Geneious 9.0.1 Beta [30] to gain information of coverage for each base position across the 2.0 Mb genome. phylogenetic analysis A phylogenetic tree of the harbor seal associated Coxiella sp. was constructed using the 16S rRNA gene. DESeq2 uses a negative binomial distribution model and the Wald test. taxa differences were considered significant if the model yielded an FDR adjusted p-value 0.05. additional analysis was conducted using Primer6 [35] where absolute taxon counts were Log(x+1) transformed. a total of 17,017 sequences were annotated as bacterial; 7,815 reads (0.36%) from the comparative, 9,118 (1.5%) from UCDs and 85 reads were unable to be assigned taxonomically. com1, the only adult, showed the most disparate microbiome. comparative samples clustered separately at the genus level and had a dissimilarity of 69.4%. bacterial phyla with > 1.5% relative abundance samples. bacterial phyla with > 10 absolute sequence counts from comparative (com) and unknown cause of death (UCD) harbor seals. microbial community with 94% of its microbiome consisting of Coxiella burnetii (order Legionellales) this number was confirmed using two bioinformatics pipelines (Pathoscope and BLASTn) this number was confirmed using two bioinformatics pipelines (Pathoscope and BLASTn) Coxiella burnetii RSA 493 chromosome and Coxiella burnetii RSA 493 plasmid pQpH1 found in sample UCD6. 99% identity to a Coxiella sp. from seal lions. a total of 215 reads with identities to known viral sequences of which 100% belonged to the comparative samples. a total of 215 reads with identities to known viral sequences of which 100% belonged to the comparative samples. com3, com5, com7, and com7 found to have sequence assignments to PhV-1. no UCD animals showed any reads associated with this virus. a total of 17,017 sequences were annotated as bacterial. bacterial phyla with > 1.5% relative abundance samples. bacterial phyla with > 10 absolute sequence counts from comparative (com) and unknown cause of death (UCD) harbor seals. heatmap hierarchical clustering of 50 significantly different bacterial genera. 319,747 sequences from sample UCD6 spanned across the 2.0Mbp C. burnetii RSA 493 chromosome and 675 sequences aligned to C. burnetii RSA 493 plasmid pQpH1. highest sequence coverages were 6,568X and 1,278X on the chromosome to the 16S rRNA gene. burnetii RSA 493 chromosome and (B) Coxiella burnetii RSA 493 plasmid pQpH1. list of the highest coverage regions in Coxiella burnetii RSA 493 chromosome found in sample UCD6. osome Elongation factor -Tu 223,400\u2013224,593 173 Chromosome Hypothetical Protein 22,568\u201323,269 39 Plasmid none (intergenic region) 32,432\u201332,567 24 Plasmid Distinct microbiomes in UCD harbor seal stranding deaths After removal of potential host and human sequences the remaining 28,288,156 sequences were used for bacterial annotation. comparative (com) and unknown cause of death (UCD) harbor seals.
