{"summary": "three pandemics occurred in the 20th century; most recently in 1968. a new outbreak may have similar devastating results. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is characterized by progressive airflow limitation. influenza is a spherical or filamentous enveloped virus. hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) subclasses are characterized by different hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) subclasses. the virus exists in two main forms: A and B. influenza has emerged in 1997 and re-emerged in 2004\u20132005. transmission to humans has been shown to be a serious threat. influenza is thought to occur in approximately 20% of the world\u2019s population annually. many cells and mediators are involved in the pathogenesis of inflammation in COPD. inflammation can result in structural changes in the bronchial wall and destruction of lung parenchyma or emphysema. host behavior in response to viruses and possible aberrant host responses may influence the persistence of inflammation following exposure to viruses. between 15% and 64% of COPD exacerbations have been found to be associated with symptomatic colds precipitated by viruses. adenovirus, rSV, influenza A and B, and parainfluenza viruses have been linked with COPD exacerbations. influenza vaccination is a potentially effective way to reduce morbidity and mortality caused by exacerbations. significant variation within the major virus types causing disease limits the success of vaccination programmes. new vaccines must be developed at regular intervals. a meta-analysis of published effects of influenza vaccination by Gross and colleagues (1995) showed a 56% reduction in respiratory illnesses, a 50% reduction in hospitalizations, a 68% reduction in all cause deaths, and a 53% reduction in pneumonia in vaccinated subjects. in epidemic years, when the proportion of exacerbations caused by influenza is higher, this effect is likely to be greater. four drugs are currently available for the prophylaxis or treatment of influenza infections: amantadines (amantadine and rimantadine) and N-inhibitors (zanamivir and oseltamivir) the amantadines inhibit viral uncoating inside host cells. oseltamivir in a daily oral dose of 75 mg and inhaled zanamivir 10 mg daily have no effect in prophylaxis of influenza-like illness compared with placebo. the efficacy of oseltamivir compared with placebo, orally administered in a dose of 75 mg daily, is 61%. zanamivir has been shown to cause bronchospasm in susceptible patients. oseltamivir has been shown to be able to cause nausea, vomiting, and retching. influenza vaccinations are recommended for all patients."}
