{"summary": "HCoVs are enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that generally cause upper respiratory and enteric infections in mammals and birds. HCoV-229E is endemic and is frequently associated with respiratory diseases ranging from the common cold to atypical pneumonia. HCoV-229E infection can result in severe or even lethal outcomes in infants, young children, seniors and those with weakened immune systems. it is important to investigate the structure and function of HCoV-229E to aid in the development of preventative or therapeutic strategies. coV S proteins are synthesized as a single polypeptide chain. proteolysis of the S protein prior to viral entry is pivotal for viral\u2013host membrane fusion. cleavage at the S1\u2013S2 domain junction removes structural constraint of S1 on S2. helical bundles from mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63, SARS and MERS feature an extended triple-helical coiled coil (HR1) surrounded by three antiparallel HR2 -helices. a conformation represents the post-fusion state of CoV spike proteins and is known as the fusion-core structure. a handful of viral inhibitors target the spike proteins of SARS and MERS by mimicking the corresponding HR2s. the remainder target HR1s in the S2 domain of SARS and MERS by mimicking the corresponding HR2s, thereby inhibiting formation of the 3HR1\u20133HR2 helical bundle. both groups of inhibitors are effective against specific HCoVs. however, the hypervariable nature of the S1 domain and the highly conserved features of the S2 domain render the latter a more suitable target for the development of pan-CoV inhibitors. a broad-spectrum anti-HCoV drug or vaccine would be more effective than a specific one. structural elucidation of the interaction between HCoV-229E and APN was only revealed very recently (Wong et al., 2017 ). fusion-core structure of HCoV-229E is similar overall to those of SARS, MERS and HCoV-NL63. a single colony was inoculated into 5 ml Luria\u2013Bertani (LB) medium containing 100 g ml1 kanamycin (AMRESCO) and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C. target protein overexpression was then induced with 1 mM isopropyl -d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG; AMRESCO) at 16\u00b0C for 16 h. fonyl fluoride (PMSF; Biovision) and lysed using a sonicator. the cell lysate was then centrifuged at 70 000g for 20 min at 4\u00b0C. fractions eluted from the TALON column were then dialyzed against dialysis buffer (20 mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 8.0, 5 mM -mercaptoethanol, 150 mM NaCl) single crystals grew after one week and were flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen for data collection. diffraction data were collected on beamline BL17U1 of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) using a wavelength of 0.9795 and an ADSC Q315r CCD detector. 360 images were recorded at a distance of 250 mm with a 1\u00b0 oscillation angle and an exposure time of 1.0 s. space group R32:H a, b, c () 46.9, 46.9, 402.1, (\u00b0) 90, 90, 120 Wavelength () 0.9795 resolution range () 44.7\u20131.86 (1.93\u20131.86) No. of unique reflections 15101 (1465) Completeness (%) 99.9 (100) Multiplicity 20.9 (21.6) I/(I) 31.5 (5.3) R meas (%) 7.5 (67.0) R p.i. the resulting sequence HR1-L6-HR2 was subcloned into the pET-28a vector with an N-terminal in-frame SUMO tag. the final construct thus contains an N-terminal His6 tag followed by the SUMO domain including the recognition sequence for Ulp1 and the coding sequence for HR1-L6-HR2. crystals were grown on a siliconized cover slip by equilibrating a mixture consisting of 1 l protein solution (8 mg ml1 HR1-L6-HR2 trimer in 20 mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl) and 1 l reservoir solution (0.03 M citric acid, 0.07 M bis-tris propane pH 7.6, 20% PEG 3350) 360 images were recorded at a distance of 250 mm with a 1\u00b0 oscillation angle and an exposure time of 1.0 s. the initial model was further improved by cycles of manual building and refinement using Coot and PHENIX. CC1/2 is the Pearson correlation coefficient between two random half data sets for the outer shell. R meas = ; R free is defined as R cryst calculated from 5% of reflections that were excluded during refinement. V-NL63 fusion core crystallized in space group R32:H, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 46.9, c = 402.1 and one molecule per asymmetric unit. structure was solved by molecular replacement using the crystal structure of the HCoV-NL63 fusion core. HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, SARS and MERS are depicted with a yellow background. cyan highlight highlights the conservation of residues in HR2 that are involved in hydrophobic interactions between HR1 and HR2. a structure is typical for the CoV fusion core and represents the post-fusion state of the HCoV-229E spike protein. a 14-amino-acid insertion arises in the HR1 regions of HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E. the 24-turn -helix of HCoV-229E HR1 is the longest among all HCoV fusion-core structures published thus far. coworkers introduced the concept of \u2018x\u2019 and \u2018da\u2019 (or \u2018y\u2019) layers to illustrate the noncanonical packing modes observed in the structure of the HCoV-NL63 fusion core. \u2018d/a\u2019 layers alternating with \u2018x\u2019 layers. \u2018d\u2019 and \u2018d\u2019 packing residues are arranged in a pseudo-hexagonal manner through hydrophobic interactions. the molecular surface volume distribution of these cavities varies in different HCoVs. for HCoV-229E, the largest cavity seen in the Ala815/Ile816 \u2018da\u2019 layer has a volume of 228 3, while the volumes of the cavities in the other \u2018da\u2019 layers fall between 20 and 50 3. for HCoV-NL63, the largest cavity was in the Ala996/Ile997 \u2018da\u2019 layer, with a the helical turns are numbered from the N-terminus to the C-terminus on one of the HR1 helices in the trimer. the packing residues lining the trimeric coiled-coil interface are indicated in black, with residues at \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018d\u2019 positions (\u2018x\u2019 layer) boxed in beige, residues at \u2018x\u2019 positions (\u2018x\u2019 layer) in magenta and residues at \u2018d/a\u2019 positions (\u2018da\u2019 V-NL63 and MERS supercoils are 188.0, 189.3 and 187.2 respectively. the 194.7 pitch value of the SARS supercoil is longer than those of MERS, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63. the electrostatic surface of SARS and MERS are strikingly similar to each other. 29E fold into a nine-turn amphipathic -helix, which fits snugly onto the 3HR1 core mainly through extensive hydrophobic inter\u00adactions. residues at the 'd' position (Leu1067, Leu1074, Leu1081, Leu1088 and Ile1095) in this -helix bury their side chains into hydrophobic pockets on the surface of the 3HR1 core. HR2 residues that either fill the hydrophobic cavities or mask the hydrophobic ridges on the 3HR1 core are largely conserved across the different HCoVs. the 3HR1 core is shown as an electrostatic surface, and HR2 residues involved in hydrophobic interactions are depicted as orange and yellow surfaces. in the helical region, residues on HR2 engage residues on HR1 through side-chain to side-chain inter\u00adactions that include hydrogen bonds and salt bridges. in the extended region of HR2, extensive polar inter\u00adactions were observed between the main-chain atoms on HR2 and the side chains of residues from HR1. the residues are colour-coded as follows: HR1, whitish grey; HR2, teal (HCoV-229E), hot pink (HCoV-NL63), gold (MERS) and slate (SARS). interactions that are conserved across different HCoVs are shown as yellow stick models. the HCoV-229E fusion core is denoted with an R cryst of 18.4%. the fusion protein is denoted with a cyan highlight. the HCoV-229E structure is denoted with a yellow background. HR1 of HCoV-229E forms a 24-turn -helix. residues 1067\u20131098 fold into a nine-turn -helix. residues 1052\u20131066 and 1099\u20131105 on either side of the helix adopt an extended conformation. the 24-turn -helix of HCoV-229E HR1 is the longest among all HCoV fusion-core structures published thus far. 26 hydrophobic residues as well as three polar residues from each HR1 line pack in layers to form the hydrophobic 3HR1 core of HCoV-229E. 'x' and 'da' mode packing also exists in the 3HR1 cores of MER and SARS. in the standard heptad repeats, the \u2018a\u2019 or \u2018d\u2019 residues (knobs) interact around the trimer threefold axis, but they do so in such a way that their side chains are more laterally arranged and fit in between the \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018g\u2019 residues (holes) cavity was in the Ala996/Ile997 \u2018da\u2019 layer, with a volume of 206 3, and the other cavities in \u2018da\u2019 layers are all smaller than 55 3. for MERS, the largest cavity in the Asn1029/Ala1030 \u2018d/a\u2019 layer has a volume of 266 3 and no other cavity larger than 50 3 was present in the structure. the 2F o F c electron-density maps are contoured at 2. (c) Electrostatic surfaces illustrating differences in the 3HR1 core from HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, SARS and MERS. the black dashed boxes highlight the only regions on different 3HR1 cores where the electrostatic surface potentials are opposite in -HCoVs and -HCoVs. the electrostatic surface of HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are strikingly similar to each other. the 3HR1 core of HCoV-229E seems to be the most hydrophobic among the four HCoVs. however, the 3HR1 core of HCoV-229E is more hydrophobic. residues at the 'a' (Ile1071, Ser1078, Val1085, Ile1092 and Leu1099) and 'g' (glu1070, Lys1077, Thr1084, Leu1091 and Thr1098) positions on the HR2 helix pack about 50% of the solvent-accessible surface area. the rest of HR2 adopts an extended conformation which also makes substantial hydrophobic inter\u00adactions with the 3HR1 core. HR2 helices are shown as teal ribbons on the dark grey surface of the HCoV-229E 3HR1 core. the lower half of the 3HR1 core is rotated for better display of the hydrophobic cavities in this region. conserved inter\u00adactions are mainly located in the regions adjacent to the end of the nine-turn helix. comparison of different CoV fusion cores reveals differences and similarities in the interactions between their HR1 and HR2 motifs. fusion-core structure of HCoV-229E reveals its HR1 folds into an unusually long 24-turn helix. the most complete post-fusion structures are for SARS (PDB entry 1wyy) and MERS (PDB entry 4njl), with a21-turn and 22-turn HR1 helix. HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 post-fusion cores are 90.1 and 98.0\u00b0C, respectively. the fusion-core structure of HCo is 97% (Fig. 1 f and 1 g) -HCoVs seem to have more non\u00adcanonical \u2018x\u2019 and \u2018da\u2019 layers than -HCoVs. compared with the 3HR1 cores of MERS, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E, the SARS supercoils are less twisted, as shown by the longer pitch and larger hydrophobic voids in the middle of the 3HR1 core. a good pan-CoV inhibitory peptide mimic of HR2 would preserve all of the conserved hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions between HR1 and HR2 of all HCoVs. the deadly global outbreaks of SARS in 2002 and MERS in 2012 highlight the importance of developing vaccines or treatments for CoVs. structural and functional characterization of HCoVs takes on greater significance. structural and functional characterization of HCoVs takes on greater significance."}
