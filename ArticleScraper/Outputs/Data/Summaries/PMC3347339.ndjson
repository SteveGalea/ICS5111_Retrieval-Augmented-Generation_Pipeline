{"summary": "positive-strand RNA viruses assemble their replication complexes on host intracellular membranes. they are usually rearranged as single- or double-membrane vesicles, convoluted membrane webs, or other membrane rearrangements. lipid microenvironment of the viral RNA replication complexes is not well defined. BMV is a representative member of the alphavirus-like superfamily of human, animal, and plant viruses. it has served as a model to study viral replication mechanisms, virus-host interactions, and many other aspects of positive-strand RNA virus infection. BMV 1a directs 2apol and viral RNA replication templates to viral spherules via the 1a-2apol interaction. increased expression levels of 2apol switch vesicular spherules to appressed stacks of double-membrane layers surrounding the nucleus with an intermembrane distance of 50 to 70 nm. a yeast deletion library showed that multiple host genes involved in membrane synthesis and trafficking are required for BMV RNA replication. ACBP is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues of higher eukaryotes. ACBP selectively binds to LCFA-CoAs with a remarkably high affinity and thus regulates their stability, metabolism, and transport. deletion of ACB1 altered the proper formation and function of BMV-induced spherule and layer replication complexes but not formation of the cellular structures karmellae. altered lipid composition in cells lacking ACB1 plays a major role in inhibited BMV RNA replication. cells were grown in galactose medium for 2 passages (24 to 48 h) and harvested when the optical density at 600 nm reached between 0.4 and 1.0. tergitol NP-40 was added to a final concentration of 1% to solubilize the fatty acids into the growth medium. gk1p was detected as described for Fig. 2A by using anti-2a and anti-Pgk1p antibodies. 2apol transcripts were detected by using a probe specific to 2apol coding sequences. 2apol was expressed on its own or along with 1a. spherule-forming conditions, 1a and 2apol were expressed from pB12VG1 (41). 1a and 2apol were expressed from pB1YT3 and pB2YT5 respectively, for BMV RNA replication under layer-forming conditions. yeast spheroplasts prepared from 10 OD600 units of cells were lysed at 4\u00b0C in TNM buffer. supernatant was adjusted to 40% iodixanol by addition of 60% iodixanol. gradients were centrifuged at 55,000 rpm (201,000 g) at 4\u00b0C for 5 h. five OD600 units of cells growing in 1% NP-40 were harvested and washed once with H2O. the pellets were heated at 80\u00b0C for 2 h in 2 ml of 2.5% H2SO4 in methanol in screw-cap glass tubes with 100 g sabic acid as an internal control. yeast cell fixation, dehydration, and embedding were performed as previously described. trp1-63 his3-200 leu2-1 was used to delete ACB1 in a YPH500 strain. cultures were grown at 30\u00b0C in defined synthetic medium containing 2% galactose as a carbon source. leucine, uracil, histidine, or combinations thereof were omitted. negative-strand RNA blots were exposed longer than those for positive-strand RNAs for comparison purposes. all experiments here and in the following figures were repeated multiple times in duplicate or triplicate each time. Accumulation of 2apol is affected by deleting ACB1. assays in panels A and D were performed under spherule-forming conditions. plasmid pB3MS82-H expresses BMV RNA3 from the GAL1 promoter. 1a and 2apol were expressed from pB12VG1 (41) for BMV RNA replication. yeast cells were grown to OD600 values of 0.4 to 1.0, and 2 OD600 units of cells were harvested. total proteins were extracted as described previously. expression of target proteins was detected with antibodies and dilutions. an 0.6-ml amount of the mixture was placed at the bottom of a Beckman TLS55 centrifuge tube and overlaid with 1.4 ml of 30% iodixanol in TNM and 100 l of TNM. the gradients were centrifuged at 55,000 rpm (201,000 g) at 4\u00b0C for 5 h. RESULTS Deletion of host ACB1 inhibits BMV RNA replication. a previous genome-wide yeast deletion mutant screen used a BMV RNA3 derivative expressing Renilla luciferase as a viral replication reporter. negative-strand RNA3 was inhibited to 30% of wt levels. accumulation of positive-strand RNAs was much reduced compared to negative-strand RNA synthesis. doubling time of acb1 yeast from a BY4743 background was 4.8 0.2 h compared to 4.4 0.3 h in wt cells. deleting ACB1 inhibited BMV RNA replication 5-fold more in terms of positive-strand RNA4 in the BY4743 background than in the YPH500 background. acb1 cells grown in wt and acb1 cells with components supporting BMV RNA replication in spherules. the active and inactive forms of Mga2p, p90 and p120 were detected with an anti-Myc antibody. Acb1p-HA was expressed alone or along with 1a and detected in soluble protein fractions. 1a-stimulated 2apol accumulation is reduced in acb1 cells. 1a was detected in the top two fractions in both wt and acb1 cells. BMV 1a is associated with membranes and stabilizes RNA3 in acb1 cells. total proteins were extracted from equal numbers of yeast cells expressing all BMV components. accumulation in acb1 cells expressing 1a increased about 34-fold. increase in RNA3 accumulation in acb1 cells was even higher than that in wt cells. 2apol is a relatively unstable protein when expressed on its own. 1 deletion mediated since HA-tagged Acb1p complemented the BMV RNA replication defect. in both acb1 and wt cells, the majority of 2apol was distributed in the bottom two fractions in the absence of 1a. in the presence of 1a, all the detected 2apol was found in the top 2 fractions. the average spherule diameter was 38.9 11.0 nm, about half the size of those formed in wt cells (74 16 nm) 15. the smaller spherules are inactive or much less efficient than wt spherules in viral RNA synthesis. spherules in acb1 cells were viewed at a higher magnification. the ole1w mutation results in a 12% decrease in UFA levels. this leads to a 20-fold inhibition in BMV RNA replication. 30% of cells that had BMV-induced replication complexes had vesicles similar in size to those induced by 1a alone. layer structures formed in acb1 cells usually had no more than 3 stacks. small spherules are preferentially formed in acb1 cells. karmellae are more closely spaced, with a cytoplasmic space of 8 to 11 nm between the stacked double membranes (4, 56, 75), compared to an intermembrane distance of 50 to 70 nm in the BMV replication compartments. overproduction of Hmg1p does not increase sterol synthesis in yeast, but overexpressed Hmg1p induces karmella formation. blotting showed 2- to 3-fold increases in accumulated OLE1 transcripts in acb1 cells. increased 16:1 and decreased SFAs resulted in a UFA/SFA ratio of 6.0 in acb1 cells compared to a ratio of 4.5 in wt cells, a 33% increase. either 16:1 or 18:1 can individually restore BMV RNA replication to levels similar to those when both were provided. both are initially sequestered as ER membrane-integral proteins, termed p120. both are initially sequestered as ER membrane-integral proteins, termed p120. the restoration of BMV RNA replication by supplemental UFAs suggested that Acb1p is functionally, but not physically, required in BMV RNA replication. the membrane flotation and UFA feeding assays collectively suggest that Acb1p is functionally, but not physically, required. supplementation with long-chain UFAs did not restore accumulation of 2apol in acb1 cells. total proteins were extracted from equal numbers of yeast cells in the absence and presence of UFAs. Western blotting was done as described for Fig. 3. the average size of these spherules was approximately 58.1 8.4 nm. the distribution in spherule diameter in acb1 cells is different from that in untreated cells. supplemental UFAs only partially complemented spherule formation. BMV RNA replication induces two forms of the viral replication complexes, spherules and layers, depending on the levels of 2apol expressed in yeast cells. negative-strand RNA3 was inhibited to 30% of wt levels, but accumulation of positive-strand RNAs was much reduced compared to negative-strand RNA synthesis. negative-strand RNA3 decreased 4- to 5-fold under spherule- and layer-forming conditions. deleting ACB1 inhibited BMV RNA replication 5-fold more in terms of positive-strand RNA4 in the BY4743 background than in the YPH500 background. wt and acb1 cells expressing BMV components and Myc-tagged Mga2p were detected with an anti-Myc antibody. Acb1p-HA was expressed alone or along with 1a and detected in soluble protein fractions by a membrane flotation assay. ifugation, membrane-integral and -associated proteins, such as Dpm1p, float to the top fractions along with low-density membranes. when expressed alone or along with low (data not shown) levels of 2apol, 1a was detected in the top two fractions in both wt and acb1 cells, indicating that 1a is membrane associated. RNA3 accumulation in acb1 cells expressing 1a increased about 34-fold. increase in RNA3 accumulation in acb1 cells was even higher than that in wt cells. 2apol is a relatively unstable protein when expressed on its own. 2apol accumulation increased with the presence of 1a in acb1 cells. the final level was lower than that in wt cells. a membrane flotation assay was performed to test whether the mild increase in 2apol was a result of its recruitment onto membranes by 1a. the average number of spherules per cell section was 23.9 (23.9 7.8, Fig. 4B to D), likely an underestimate. smaller spherules tend to cluster and overlap and are sometimes hard to visualize separately. the diameter of the spherules was reduced compared to that in wt cells. more abundant (23.9 7.8/cell section) spherules formed in acb1 cells. labels indicate nucleus (Nuc) and cytoplasm (Cyto) labels indicate nucleus (Nuc) and cytoplasm (Cyto) in wt cells expressing 1a and GAL1 2apol, 75% of cells containing BMV-induced replication complexes formed layers (48) in acb1 cells, layer structures were found in 30% of cells that had BMV-induced replication complexes (Fig. 5B, cell 2 and Fig. 5D) small spherules are preferentially formed in acb1 cells under conditions that promote layer formation in wt cells. karmellae are more closely spaced, with a cytoplasmic space of 8 to 11 nm between the stacked double membranes (4, 56, 75), compared to an intermembrane distance of 50 to 70 nm in the BMV layer replication compartments. overproduction of Hmg1p does not increase sterol synthesis in yeast, but overexpressed Hmg1p induces karmella formation (80). blotting showed 2- to 3-fold increases in accumulated OLE1 transcripts in acb1 cells. increased 16:1 and decreased SFAs resulted in a UFA/SFA ratio of 6.0 in acb1 cells compared to a ratio of 4.5 in wt cells. both positive-strand RNA3 and RNA4 increased at least 3-fold in acb1 yeast grown in medium supplemented with UFAs or total FAs. either 16:1 or 18:1 can individually restore BMV RNA replication to levels similar to those when both were provided. both are initially sequestered as ER membrane-integral proteins, termed p120. addition of 16:1, UFAs, or total FAs substantially inhibited accumulation of OLE1 transcripts by approximately 70% to 80% compared to untreated wt cells. restoration of BMV RNA replication by supplemental UFAs suggested that Acb1p is functionally required for BMV RNA replication. despite significant differences in 2apol levels, spherule and layer replication complexes support similar levels of BMV RNA replication. a decrease in 2apol levels did not restore the accumulation of 2apol in acb1 cells. the average size of these spherules was approximately 58.1 8.4 nm. the distribution in spherule diameter in acb1 cells is different from that in untreated cells. supplemental UFAs only partially complemented spherule formation. mutants with specific amino acid substitutions within an amphipathic -helix are crucial for 1a-ER membrane association and spherule formation (48). loss of host ACBP may have effects on BMV RNA replication similar to those of mutations within 1a (48) class II 1a mutants have specific substitutions in amino acids T397, Y401, K403 and Y404. helical conformation of 1a upon binding to membranes may favor 1a-1a interactions that facilitate formation of 60- to 80-nm spherules. only a portion of the spherule population increased in size. altered lipid composition may affect the relocalization or activity of host proteins that are required for spherule formation, such as reticulon-homology proteins. protein A coats the inside of spherule membranes (39) in acb1 cells, 1a accumulated to levels similar to those in wt cells. 1a-induced formation of spherules with half the diameter of those induced in wt cells correlated with 4-fold increase in spherule frequency. a 12% reduction in UFA levels in the ole1w mutant preferentially affects the lipid composition of spherule-enveloping membranes. results suggest that BMV viral replication requires a well-controlled lipid microenvironment that, when mildly altered, sabotages the viral replication more dramatically than host growth and division. PI4KIII creates a PI4P-enriched microenvironment that is required for CVB3 replication. many plant positive-strand RNA viruses form vesicular replication complexes in infected host cells. viruses in the Tombusviridae family replicate in mitochondria (66) and peroxisomes (65) and viruses in the Bromoviridae family replicate in ER (34) and tonoplast (23) membrane-bound vesicles. this notion is supported by the fact that no growth phenotype is observed upon deletion of individual AtACBP genes (81). membrane rearrangements induced by BMV 1a are specifically affected in cells lacking ACB1. acb1p plays important roles in synthesis of cellular lipids and maintenance of cellular membrane structures. in cells lacking ACB1, aberrant membrane structures are frequently accumulated. amino acids T397, Y401, K403 and Y404 are in the major membrane-interacting face of helix A (1a amino acids 392 to 409) (48) a conformational change of 1a upon binding to membranes may favor 1a-1a interactions that facilitate formation of 60- to 80-nm spherules. RHPs are recruited by 1a from peripheral ER membranes to the interior of viral spherules (15) reticulon-homology proteins (RHPs) are a group of membrane-shaping proteins that induce and stabilize ER membrane tubules (83). deleting one or two RHP-encoding genes decreased spherule diameters. in acb1 cells, 1a accumulated to levels similar to those in wt cells. 1a occupies the majority, if not all, of the spherule interior. deleting ACB1 affects cellular lipid synthesis, including decreased accumulation of long-chain FAs. coxsackievirus B3 recruits phosphatidylinositol-4-kinase III (PI4KIII) via its 3A protein to the viral replication sites. PI4KIII creates a PI4P-enriched microenvironment that is required for CVB3 replication. spherular replication complexes in mitochondria (66) and peroxisomes (65) and viruses in the Bromoviridae family replicate in ER (34) and tonoplast (23) membrane-bound vesicles. a better understanding of the roles of Acb1p in BMV RNA replication in yeast should help in designing experiments that can be feasibly tested in whole plants."}
