{"summary": "a better understanding of the interactions between viruses and the central nervous system (CNS) represents a major issue in viral pathogenesis. on the host side, it is essential to adapt a strategy of replication that will minimize virus-induced cell damage. on the host side, it is essential to quickly halt virus multiplication. iFN- or tumor necrosis factor alpha can stimulate intracellular pathways that interfere with viral replication. both mechanisms can be combined to limit viral multiplication in the brain. one example is infection with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) CD8 T cells used in these assays were either CTL clones or lines with pre-defined epitope specificity, often derived from TCR-transgenic animals. one still unsatisfactorily resolved issue in neurovirology is whether antiviral CD8 T cells can indeed recognize and directly attack virus-infected neurons in the course of a natural disease. BDV infection triggers neuronal MHC I expression. we used cortical neurons prepared from Lewis rat embryos. this time point, neurons have established mature synapses. results are expressed as means sem of at least four independent experiments. we used infected and non-infected neurons treated with either IFN- (blue) or IFN-+TTX (red) to induce MHC I expression. phenotypic characterization of brain-infiltrating lymphocytes revealed that CD8 T cells accounted for 51%1.5% of all T cells present in the brain (i.e., positive for the TCR), while CD4 T cells represented 30%3% of TCR+ cells. this ratio was probably under-estimated since we detected a high proportion of TCR+ cells (20%) that were negative for both CD4 and CD8 expression. brain-infiltrating lymphocytes expressed high levels of effector molecules such as IFN- (300-fold induction on average), Granzyme B (180-fold induction) or FasL (50-fold induction) expression of Perforin mRNA was also significantly elevated, although at lower levels. supernatants were assayed after 48 hours of culture using Luminex multiplex kits. only levels of IFN- and IL-10 are shown. values expressed as mean concentrations sem of four independent experiments. e secretion resulted mainly from the recognition of viral antigens presented by neurons. results were below threshold for IL-4, IL-5, IL-9 and IL-13. brain-purified CD8 T cells are arrested upon contact with infected neurons. induction of MHC I expression at surface of non-infected neurons with IFN- and TTX was not sufficient to arrest CD8 T cells. compared with non-infected neurons, non-infected neurons treated with IFN- and TTX or BDV-infected neurons treated with anti-MHC I antibody. CD8 T cells purified from cervical lymph nodes of the same infected animals were highly mobile, regardless of whether they were assayed on infected a fraction of brain-purified CD8 T cells formed long projections once arrested on BDV-infected neurons. these projections were never observed in a single CD8 T cells purified from lymph nodes. calcein beading figures were observed throughout the culture. neurons were imaged for 45 minutes after addition of brain CD8 T cells. levels of calcein fluorescence measured at the beginning of the experiment were subtracted from levels obtained at the end of the incubation. a system based on microelectrode arrays (MEA) allows to monitor the firing pattern of a neuronal network grown on a grid of sixty electrodes embedded in a culture dish. before adding CD8 T cells, spontaneous firing frequencies were similar whether neurons were infected or not with BDV. the mean burst frequency was first calculated under spontaneous conditions. for each condition, data were acquired from 100 to 460 electrodes. longer incubation times with brain-purified T cells lead to neuronal apoptosis. pre-incubation of BDV-infected neurons with anti-MHC I antibody significantly reduced neuronal apoptosis. apoptosis was measured using the fluorescent probe FLICA. levels of VAD-FMK fluorescence were determined on 5 randomly selected fields. BDV infection induces MHC I expression on neurons 14 days after infection. \u00dfIII-tubulin neuronal protein was detected using a mouse monoclonal antibody. monoclonal antibody recognizing the rat MHC I RT1-A molecule. neurons were rapidly harvested, fixed and further stained for the intracellular neuronal protein Tau. non-infected neurons expressed little or no MHC I molecules (0.50.3% positive neurons) 5% of all T cells present in the brain (i.e., positive for the TCR), whereas CD4 T cells represented 30%3% of TCR+ cells (Figure 2A) this ratio contrasted with the usual 1 to 3 ratio found in cervical lymph nodes of the same animals. this ratio was probably under-estimated since we detected a high proportion of TCR+ cells that were negative for both CD4 and CD8 expression. values were normalized for actin mRNA levels compared to cervical lymph node CD8 T cells of the same animal. results are expressed as means sem of four independent experiments. cytokine levels in the supernatants were assayed at 48 h with a Luminex assay specific for 9 rat cytokines. we did not detect any cytokine above the threshold level of detection of the assay (4.88 pg/ml) in the supernatants of CD8 T cells purified from lymph nodes. the mobility of CD8 T cells isolated from the brain was extremely reduced upon incubation with infected neurons compared to non-infected ones. the measured mean velocity was 2.83 m/min (95% confidence interval (CI) of mean 2.59 - 3.03) in the presence of infected neurons compared to 15.27 m/min, (95% CI 13.00\u201317.53) with non-infected ones. CD8 T cells purified from the brain of BDV-infected rats were labeled with PKH-26 (red) and added to Calcein-AM labeled neurons (green) which were non-infected (A) or infected (B) with BDV. randomly chosen trajectories of individual cells were automatically tracked using Imaris software. calcein-loaded infected neurons were incubated with brain-purified CD8 T cells. calcein beading figures were observed throughout the culture, affecting both neurites and neuronal somas. neurons were imaged for 45 minutes after addition of brain CD8 T cells. incubation of BDV-infected neurons with anti-MHC I antibody markedly decreased calcein beading. a representative BDV-infected neuronal network loaded with calcein AM (green) at the start (t = 0 min) and (B) 45 min after coculture with PKH-26 stained brain-derived CD8 T cells. non-infected neuronal network remained electrically active up to 3 h after addition of CD8 T cells. neuronal network remained electrically active up to 3 h after addition of CD8 cells. fluorescent probe FLICA was used to detect activation of caspases 3 and 7 in live neurons. the intensity of fluorescent signals provided a direct quantification of apoptosis. we did not detect significant apoptosis in non-infected neurons. the modalities of action of CD8 T cells in the CNS and notably the interplay between immune regulation and pathogen control are complex and variable. we provide novel information concerning the modalities of interaction between antiviral CTL and infected neurons. BDV infection of neurons could trigger the production of type-1 interferons, which in turn, could induce MHC I expression. a microarray analysis provided experimental evidence of a type-1 interferon signature in BDV-infected neurons. this is consistent with previous reports showing that neurons express different components of the molecular machinery required for epitope processing and MHC I presentation. this is consistent with previous reports showing that neurons express different components of the molecular machinery required for epitope processing. calcein leakage from neurons following oxygen-glucose deprivation could result from opening of neuronal hemichannels. despite these early changes in neuronal permeability, electrical properties of infected neurons were preserved for a significant duration after addition of brain-purified CTL. this contrasts with the immediate shutdown of electrical signaling, both in single neurons and networks. CD8 T cells purified from brains of BDV-infected rats expressed all cytolytic effectors, including IFN-, perforin, granzyme-B or FasL. previous studies in the rat model of BDV infection have also shown expression of perforin mRNA in the brain [24]. the slow kinetics of neuronal death suggests that this progressive neuronal loss of function may leave open a window of opportunity for future treatments. authors described this process as \u201cfocal axonal degeneration\u201d, beginning with axonal swelling and mitochondrial dysfunction. Plating was performed on variable supports depending on the use. half of the cultures were infected with cell-free BDV (Giessen strain He/80) by 14 days post-infection, BDV infection of neurons was verified by immunofluorescence. rats were deeply anesthetized and perfused with 50 ml of PBS through the left ventricle to remove blood from the organs. brain suspensions were digested for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C in HH containing collagenase D (1 mg/ml), trypsin inhibitor (TLCK, 0.5 g/ml) and DNase I (10 g/ml). cells were sorted based on PE+ and (FITChigh or Alexa-647high) expression. the purity of the cells was always higher than 99%. Flow cytometry data were collected on FACSCalibur or LSRII cytometers. analysis of cytokine production IFN- levels was assessed by intra-cytoplasmic staining. cells were labeled for membrane expression of TCR and CD8\u00df. cells were labeled for intra-cytoplasmic production of IFN-. RNA preparation and analysis Total RNA was isolated from highly purified CD8 T cells using the RNeasy Minikit (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France) cDNAs were stored at 20\u00b0C until use. PCR cycling conditions were 50\u00b0C for 2 minutes and 95\u00b0C for 10 minutes. each sample was run in duplicate and mean values were used for quantitation. the relative amount of mRNA in each sample was calculated as the ratio between the target mRNA and the corresponding control actin mRNA. time-lapse confocal microscopy Fluorescence measurements and imaging were performed on a Zeiss LSM-510 inverted confocal microscope with 10X, 20X or 40X objectives. one frame was captured every 20 s on average. single-cell-tracking analysis was performed automatically with Imaris sotware. signals corresponding to electrical activity from the 60 electrodes of the MEA were recorded using the MC Rack Software (multi Channel Systems GmbH, Reutlingen, Germany) the signal corresponding to the firing of a single action potential by a neuron was identified as a spike. we also detected high frequency grouped spikes trains, known as bursts. primary culture of neurons and viral infection Primary cortical neurons were prepared from Lewis rat embryos at gestational day 18 using a previously described procedure. after dissection, the cortex tissue was dissociated by incubation for 15 min in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) containing 10 U/ml Papain (Worthington), followed by gentle dissociation in PBS containing 10 U/ml BSA and 1.5 mg/ml Trypsin inhibitor. rats were deeply anesthetized and perfused with 50 ml of PBS through the left ventricle to remove blood from the organs. rats were deeply anesthetized and perfused with 50 ml of PBS through the left ventricle. PE-conjugated anti-rat TCR (clone R73) (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) or anti-rat CD8 (clone 3.4.1) for staining, BMCs or lymph node cells (LNC) were suspended in FACS buffer (consisting of PBS with 5% FCS) the purity of the cells was always higher than 99%. neurons were washed twice in Perm/Wash buffer before FACS analysis. non-infected neurons were treated with either 100 U/ml mouse IFN- (Biosource) plus 1 M Tetrodotoxin (TTX, Sigma) or 100 U/ml rat IFN-\u00df (PBL interferon source) cDNAs were stored at 20\u00b0C until use. cDNAs were stored at 20\u00b0C until use. cDNAs were stored at 20\u00b0C until use. the products of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) LightCycler amplification were detected with SYBR green I dye (Roche Diagnostics) PCR cycling conditions were 50\u00b0C for 2 minutes and 95\u00b0C for 10 minutes, followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 seconds, 60\u00b0C for 1 minute, followed by the final melting curve program. each sample was run in duplicate and mean values were used for quantitation. cells were stained with 4 M PKH-26 at room temperature for 5 min. reaction stopped by adding FCS and cells were washed once in RPMI medium containing 10% FCS. electrophysiology Neuronal cortical cultures were prepared from Lewis rats. half of the MEA dishes were infected with BDV on day 1. signals corresponding to electrical activity from the 60 electrodes of the MEA were recorded using the MC Rack software. supernatants were assayed after 48 hours of culture using Luminex multiplex kits. levels of IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-13 were below detection threshold. values are expressed as mean concentrations sem of four independent experiments. neuronal apoptosis was quantified following incubation for 4 hours with brain CD8 T cells. levels of VAD-FMK fluorescence were determined on 5 randomly selected fields for each condition. the table shows only the genes for which the difference between control (non-infected) and non-infected neurons was of more that 2-fold. CD8 T cells purified from the brains of a BDV infected rat were labeled with PKH-26 (red) and added to calcein-loaded, non-infected neurons. movie is based on one image capture every 20 s using a 10X objective. the focus of the microscope was set on the CD8 T cell to visualize the projections. time counter and scale bar are inserted at the bottom left of the video. projection of a T cell interacting with a neuronal soma is clearly visible for >15 min and then rapidly retracts in less than 2 min. calcein beading figures consecutive to the interaction with CD8 T cells occur throughout the neuronal network and on cell somas, with no specific localization with the sites of CD8 T cell binding."}
