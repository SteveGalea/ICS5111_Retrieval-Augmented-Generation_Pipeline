{"summary": "the viral distribution and its association with clinical character were statistically analyzed. the most popular viruses were enterovirus/rhinovirus (EV/RV) (54.05%), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (51.08%), human bocavirus (BoCA) (33.78%), human parainfluenzaviruse type 3 (PIV3) (15.41%), and adenovirus (12.97%). more than 50% of ARI cases suffered unnecessary or inappropriate prescription of antibiotics, since most acute respiratory tract infections are caused by viruses. this often leads to severe consequence such as high rate of resistance [6], especially in those with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI), which frequently happens in virus-infected children [3]. etiology studies, especially those of viruses, have been performed to help diagnosis and proper antiviral treatment of SARI [7,8], as well as prevention of nosocomial infections among in a comprehensive evaluation of viral etiology and clinical characterization among hospitalized children with SARI admitted to the Beijing Children Hospital from May 2008 to March 2010. participants were inpatients from Beijing Children\u2019s Hospital between May 2008 and March 2010, diagnosed as SARI based on clinical grounds recommended by the world health organization (WHO) 10 L of the nucleic acids were tested using xTAG\u00ae RVP FAST assay according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. the RVP Fast assay simultaneously detects the following viruses: respiratory syncytial virus (RSV); influenza(IFV) A (H1, H3, and H5) and B viruses; parainfluenza viruse (PIV), parainfluenza viruse (PIV) 1, 2, 3, and 4; human metapneumovirus (ADV); pic the criteria of hospitalized patient inclusion were: sudden onset of fever >38oC and cough or sore throat and difficulty breathing. additional criteria were a normal or low leukocyte count, or lower chest wall indrawing. 120 were defined as very severe acute respiratory infection (VSARI) cases. the assay includes an internal positive control added to each specimen at the extraction stage (Escherichia coli phage MS2 RNA) and a positive run control that is added to each run (bacteriophage lambda DNA). Statistical analysis Comparisons between urban and suburb patients, as well as severe and very severe infection, were performed using chi-square test. 151 40.81 6-23 155 41.89 24-59 57 15.41 > = 60 7 1.89 Severity VSARI 120 32.43 Viruses Detected Any virus 350(N=370) 94.29 (91.4-96.8) Orthomyxoviuses 26 7.03 IFVA-pH1N1 20 5.41 IFVA-H3 2 0.54 IFVB 3 0.81 Paramyxoviruses 245 66.22 RSV 189 51 EV/RV was the most frequently discovered pathogen in this study. it was active throughout whole year, with a flat line of infection rate around 50%. hMPV showed similar distribution as RSVB, but the infection rate was much lower. comparison between urban and suburban/rural patients. average age 15.34 vs. 8.72 months. ratio of young children (24 to 59 months) is obviously higher in rural area.
