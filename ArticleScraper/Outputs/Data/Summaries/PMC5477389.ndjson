{"summary": "GENOME ANNOUNCEMENT Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) belongs to the Nidovirales order, the Coronaviridae family, the Coronavirinae subfamily, and the Betacoronavirus. its genome is a single-stranded, linear, and nonsegmented RNA of around 31 kb. BCoV is responsible for respiratory and enteric diseases in cattle. the NS2, HE, S, ns5, and M genes are closely related to the BCoV Bubalus/Italy/179/07-11 strain (accession no. EU019216), with nucleotide identities of 99.88%, 99.45%, 99.02%, 98.79%, and 99.28% respectively. the highest Blastn score for the N gene was found with the American enteric BCoV-ENT (accession no. partial genomes in which nsp12, S, and N genes of american and Asian BCoVs cluster together in a cluster tentatively named C1. The DcCoV S gene individualized from both HCoV-OC43 and BCoV S genes. potential recombination events could be at the origin of DcCoV."}
