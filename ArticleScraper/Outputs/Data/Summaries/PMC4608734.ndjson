{"summary": "a common misconception is that pathogens directly produce these behavioral symptoms, but in fact SB is orchestrated by the host\u2019s immune and neuroendocrine systems. in mammals, such changes can be quantified based on behavior and reflect reprioritization of motivation during disease. ligands can also activate the epithelium in areas with an intact blood\u2013brain barrier, causing it to synthetize various prostaglandins. ligands can also activate the epithelium in areas with an intact blood\u2013brain barrier, causing it to synthetize various prostaglandins and release them into nuclei involved in specific behaviors. physiological responses to sickness are initiated by the immune system and propagated mainly by the brain and liver. many of these are believed to benefit host resistance to infections. two, fever and anemia, have been linked to SB [1] inflammatory cytokines trigger the production of the peptide hormone hepcidin in the liver. hepcidin then internalizes the iron exporter protein ferroportin. macrophages trap the iron recycled from erythrocytes, and enterocytes stop transferring dietary iron to the circulation. hypoferremia is a well-regulated process intended to deprive pathogens of the iron essential for their growth. it affects several classes of pathogens, including many bacteria, some viruses, and several protozoa. iron overload increased infection rates of pathogens such as tuberculosis, malaria, and brucellosis. a seminal paper by Benjamin L. Hart was the first to suggest that SB in its entirety is a coordinated response benefitting the host [1] Hart suggested that SB is primarily intended to serve these physiological adaptations. he proposed that SB evolved to conserve energy needed to sustain metabolically demanding fever. symptom is reduced grooming, which deprives sick animals of calories needed to fuel fever. physiologists have gained much mechanistic insight into hypoferremia. physiologists have since gained much mechanistic insight into hypoferremia. proposed symptoms are intended to protect sensitive organs and tissues from further damage. all these theories focus on direct benefits that infected individuals may derive from SB; they disregard the indirect effects that SB may have at the group level. if gains to direct fitness cannot fully explain SB, perhaps inclusive fitness could come into play. social disinterest, depression, hyperalgesia, fatigue, and hypersomnia reduce social activity of infected individuals. sexual disinterest suppresses courtship and mating behaviors. reduced parental care entails less interaction with offspring. self-imposed isolation may account for folk observation that terminally ill dogs leave owners to die alone. eusocial insects can detect infected individuals through visual, olfactory, and chemical cues. chemical communication is used to coordinate social immunity. eusocial insects are ideal settings for spread of pathogens. ants are less sociable [8], avoid contacting brood [8,63], stop transferring food to nest mates [9], become less motile [9], decrease allogrooming of nest mates [64], and spend most of their time outside the nest. this compulsion to leave the hive may explain sudden mass desertions observed in the recent epidemic of collapsed colony disease (CCD) the detection of infected conspecifics has evolved as a protective avoidance mechanism, but the transmission of such signals could have been selected for. the stereotypic posture and motion that infected animals adopt because of fatigue and hyperalgesia can act as additional cues. infected hosts become hyperactive and interact more with potential hosts. rabid dogs become fearless and bite, and rodents infected with toxoplasma gondii lose their fear of cats. social and sexual disinterest, as well as anorexia and adipsia, further reduce animal drive to travel farther afield. eusocial insects exhibit social immunity, collective behaviors that promote parasite resistance [61] and limit contagious interactions among group members [62]. eusocial insects exhibit social immunity, collective behaviors that promote parasite resistance [61] and limit contagious interactions among group members [62]. this compulsion to leave the hive may explain sudden mass desertions. the behavior of parasitized termites has been less studied. but infected individuals seem to migrate to bottom strata of mounds and die there. the case for social immunity in Eusocial Insects Eusocial insects form colonies dubbed \"superorganisms\" eusocial insects exhibit social immunity, collective behaviors that promote parasite resistance [61] and limit contagious interactions among group members [62] ile [9], decrease allogrooming of nest mates [64], spend most of their time in the hive [67], and leave it to die in isolation [66]. this compulsion to leave the hive may explain sudden mass desertions observed in the recent epidemic of collapsed colony disease (CCD) in the last decade, bat populations of many species in North America collapsed because of the \u201cwhite nose\u201d fungal disease. a study in wild deer mice has shown that highly active individuals, which encountered more mice, exhibited higher viral infection rates [80]. in the few infectious diseases studied (barring HIV), this overlap exceeds 80% [81,82], and estimates for influenza range between 50% and 90% [81,83]. animal species vary in the degree of intergroup relatedness based on their life history. at the opposite end of the spectrum lie eusocial animals. some experimental evidence suggests that SB is actually not as universal as commonly assumed. different pathogens invoke SB of varying intensities. the individual loses little (as it would die anyway) and gains much (as it saves its relatives from death) from a debilitating behavioral response. increased odds for transmission would also favor a vigorous SB. the mystery of SB is not only intellectually provoking but also clinically significant. this is because behavioral symptoms are routinely relieved using anti-inflammatory drugs such as cyclooxygenase inhibitors."}
