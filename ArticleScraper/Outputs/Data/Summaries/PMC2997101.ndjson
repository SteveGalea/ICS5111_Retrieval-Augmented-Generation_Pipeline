{"summary": "this work aims to facilitate this line of research by finding good clusterings of various datasets with known partitions. the importance of the clustering problem has given rise to several greedy algorithms such as -Means, optimization-based methods such as Normalized-Cut and neural-net based methods amongst others. our objective function performs well in clustering diverse types of datasets. we pose the hierarchical clustering problem as a finite number of instances of a graph partitioning problem, called Arithmetic-Harmonic Cut (AH-Cut) the -Means algorithm initializes clusters by arbitrarily selecting one object to represent each cluster. each of the remaining objects is assigned to a cluster and the clustering criterion is used to calculate the cluster mean. this continues until there is no change when the clusters are recalculated. Normalized-Cut (and its -way extension) has been used for image segmentation [6] and circuit partitioning for hierarchical VLSI design [7]. Normalized-Cut In the context of image segmentation, Shi and Malik [1] introduce Normalized-Cut. they use a similarity metric for, and thus Normalized-Cut is typically expressed as a minimisation problem. the implementation also allows -way Normalized-Cut, Yu and Shi [8] examine this further. it considers the first eigen vectors and yields partite sets from a discretisation step following it. complexity results indicate that there is unlikely to be a polynomial time algorithm (or even approximation), but that the exponential component of the running time is at worst only a function of a small independent parameter. AH-Cut gives a robust and broadly useful hierarchical clustering method. ion of AH-Cut is identical except that we maximise the function. if a maximisation problem has an algorithm that guarantees such a bound for every, has a constant factor approximation scheme (ptas) a cluster and the clustering criterion is used to calculate the cluster mean. these means are used as the new cluster points and each object is reassigned to the cluster that it is most similar to. this continues until there is no change when the clusters are recalculated. Normalized-Cut In the context of image segmentation, Shi and Malik [1] introduce Normalized-Cut. they use a similarity metric for, and thus Normalized-Cut is expressed as a minimisation problem. it is well-known that by negating weights the Max-Cut problem is equivalent to the corresponding Min-Cut problem. Graclus Graclus implements a multilevel algorithm that optimizes various weighted graph clustering objectives, such as the popular ratio cut, normalized cut, etc. Graclus Graclus implements a multilevel algorithm that optimizes various weighted graph clustering objectives. the -Means algorithm initializes clusters by arbitrarily selecting one object to represent each cluster. each object is reassigned to the cluster that it is most similar to. a graph bipartitioning problem asks for a partition such that some function on the (weights of the) edges between and satisfies the given bound. Normalized-Cut In the context of image segmentation, Shi and Malik [1] introduce Normalized-Cut. they use a similarity metric for, and thus Normalized-Cut is expressed as a minimisation problem with the following objective function. it is well-known that by negating weights the Max-Cut problem is equivalent to the corresponding Min-Cut problem. the implementation also allows -way Normalized-Cut, Yu and Shi [8] examine this further. it considers the first eigen vectors and yields partite sets from a discretisation step following it. this results in a poor clustering results for image segmentation. complexity results indicate that there is unlikely to be a polynomial time algorithm (or even approximation) but that the exponential component of the running time is at worst only a function of a small independent parameter and therefore the problem is likely to still have effective algorithms. the results indicate that AH-Cut gives a robust and broadly useful hierarchical clustering method. roximation and Complexity If a problem is -hard, then has no ptas unless. a problem is fixed-parameter tractable if there is an algorithm that solves the problem in time bounded by where is the parameter, is the size of the input. the optimisation verion of AH-Cut is identical except that we maximise the function. a maximisation problem with objective function guarantees a solution where for some then we say has a constant factor approximation algorithm. the goal of the optimisation version of Max-Cut is to maximise. we construct an instance of AH-Cut where and (i.e., is a complete graph) the elements of are weighted as follows: if, then we set. theorem 4 AH-Cut is -hard and -complete. Proof. Assume there is a -approximation algorithm for AH-Cut. by lemma 1 the partition induces a solution for AH-Cut such that. by lemma 3 we have a set such that it is clear that AH-Cut is in. first we compute a greedy solution as follows: Pick an edge such that for every. Add to and to. While do Pick a vertex such that. If then set, otherwise set. Note that we assume that is connected. If is not connected then all vertices of degree can be discarded. despite the size of this datasets, our algorithm finds all three clusters. in each case we compare our algorithm to Normalized-Cut and where possible to -Means and Graclus. -Means performs much better than Normalized-Cut and successfully separates melanoma from colon and leukemia samples when. -Means performs much better than Normalized-Cut and gives three distinct clusters of colon, melanoma and leukemia samples when. rhagic disease Virus (RHV), Equine arteritis Virus (EV1), Lactate Dehydrogenase-elevating Virus (LDV) were also identified as outliers by Yap et al. [16]. the group also includes other ssRNA positive strand viruses. the first partition of AH-Cut consists of: brain related tissues; eye related tissues; face related tissues; others (including ovary tissue) the second partition of AH-Cut consists of: bonemarrow related cells; blood cells; heart related cells; ftal cells; others (including ovary tissue) Graclus performs similarly to Normalized-Cut on this dataset. for the first subpopulation, the first genes had a mean of, genes had mean of, and the other genes had mean zero. for the third subpopulation, genes had mean of, genes had mean of and the other genes had mean zero. signature of the three types of cancer is related to genes of which are under-expressed and are over-expressed. the fixed-parameter tractability of AH-Cut promises the possibility of a practical exact algorithm, which would give stronger evidence of AH-Cut's performance. further studies on datasets of all kinds would also be useful to explore the strengths and weaknesses of AH-Cut based clustering. the quality of the memetic algorithm solutions suggest that there may be a link between the fixed-parameter tractability and the performance of the memetic algorithm. optimisation version of Max-Cut is to maximise. we construct an instance of AH-Cut where and (i.e., is a complete graph) the elements of are weighted as follows: if, then we set, if we set and for all other edges we set. We can obtain in polynomial time. AH-Cut is -hard and -complete. Proof. Assume there is a -approximation algorithm for AH-Cut. by lemma 3 we have a set such that it is clear that AH-Cut is in. as two vertices from are in, the edges between those two vertices and contribute to. The third vertex in contributes to. The edges between the two vertices and contribute to. Finally the edges between the vertex and contribute to. Thus in total we have and as and we have As we assume that, Lemma 3 Assume. without loss of generality we may assume that (by switching and as necessary) if or, we solve the instance by complete enumeration in constant time. otherwise assume the optimal cut of cuts at least edges of and induces the partition. by lemma 1 the partition induces a solution for AH-Cut such that. theorem 6 AH-Cut is fixed-parameter tractable with an algorithm running in time where is the optimisation target value, is the maximum edge weight and is the number of vertices in the input graph. despite the size of this dataset, our algorithm finds all three clusters. we compare our algorithm to Normalized-Cut and where possible to -Means and Graclus. the dataset consists of gene expressions of melanoma, colon tumour and leukaemia samples. the reason for taking these samples is that others have heterogeneous profiles. noma from colon and leukemia samples when and gives three distinct clusters of colon, melanoma and leukemia samples when. Yap et al. [16] generate the tetra-nucleotide usage pattern profile for each virus from which a distance matrix is created. negative strand ssRNA viruses are clustered in two subgroups. one unmixed with positive strand ssRNA viruses, the other in the group \"Mixed\" normalized-Cut mixes positive and negative strand ssRNA viruses even in the first partition for the majority of runs. the second partition of AH-Cut consists of: brain related tissues; eye related tissues; face related tissues; others (including ovary tissue) the partitioning for this dataset is quite reasonable except occurrence ovary tissues in different partitions. the second subpopulation, genes had mean of, genes had mean of and the other genes had mean zero. signature of the three types of cancer is related to genes of which are under-expressed and are over-expressed. a second application on the rest yields the second and third group as the two partitions. the quality of the memetic algorithm solutions suggest that there may be a link between the fixed-parameter tractability and the performance of the memetic algorithm. if a simple greedy algorithm does not produce a solution with a sufficiently high objective value then the instance size must be bounded by an relatively simple function of the parameters. memetic algorithms combine local search heuristics with crossover operators used in genetic algorithms [23]\u2013[25]. the essence of our algorithm is similar to the work of Merz and Freisleben [26] for Graph Bi-partitioning. a variable-neighborhood search (VNS) is first proposed by Hansen and Mladenovic [31] for a local search in the neighborhood of the new offspring. in VNS, first local search is done starting from each neighbor of the current solution. otherwise, the order of the neighborhood is increased by one. memetic algorithms combine local search heuristics with crossover operators used in genetic algorithms [23]\u2013[25]. a greedy algorithm for initialization of a set of solutions for AH-Cut (detailed in the parameterized algorithm); a differential greedy crossover for evolution of the population; and a variable neighborhood local search. a variable-neighborhood search (VNS) is first proposed by Hansen and Mladenovic [31] for a local search in the neighborhood of the new offspring. a -th order neighbor of a paritition giving a solution for AH-Cut is obtained by swapping the partite set of vertices. all vertices that are contained in the same set for both the parents are filled according to a greedy recombination method similar to the greedy algorithm used for the parameterized algorithm. Suppose the parent solutions and have the partitions, and respectively (after interchanging the sets suitably) the starting set (resp. ) for the offspring is given by the intersection (resp. ), with the remainder of the partition calculated greedily. we have at each step a graph as input, and the two subgraphs induced by each of the sets of the vertex partition as output. stopping when we arrive to a graph with just one vertex, we generate a hierarchical clustering in a top-down fashion."}
