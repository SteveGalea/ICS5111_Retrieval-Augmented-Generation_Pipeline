{"summary": "healthcare utilization patterns will affect the generalizability of data from sentinel sites and the potential to use them to estimate burden of disease. a stratified, two-stage cluster survey sample was used to select 1200 households from the department of Santa Rosa. sentinel surveillance for influenza can provide information on trends in viral circulation patterns and seasonality. but healthcare seeking behaviors can affect who accesses care at the sentinel site, limiting the ability to gather information to guide public health policies. Guatemala has a population of 12,755,366 in 2008, with a gross national income per capita of $2680. it is considered a middle-income country by the world bank. the government provides free healthcare in several different settings. government-run healthcare facilities within the department include one hospital (the National Hospital of Cuilapa, 176 beds), 14 health centers (one in each municipio) and 56 health posts in the outlying communities. healthcare services can be sought from more than 114 pharmacies or drug shops. the protocol for this study was reviewed and approved by the institutional review boards of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA) and the Universidad del Valle de Guatemala (Guatemala City, Guatemala) the sample size of 600 households per strata (1200 total) was based on calculations for diarrhea, a more common syndrome, rather than for pneumonia. a case of severe respiratory illness, referred to as pneumonia, was defined as self-reported cough and difficulty breathing for two or more days. severe pneumonia was defined for children 3 years old who met the case definition as any of the following: blue lips and/or nails, inability to breastfeed or drink, convulsions, unconsciousness or decreased activity. study area and population Guatemala, with a population of 12,755,366 in 2008, had a gross national income per capita of $2680. the population in 2006 was 308,522 residing in 14 municipios with an estimated 768 communities. the mortality rate of children 5 years of age for Santa Rosa is 58 per 1000 live births, significantly higher than the average for the country. the mortality rate of children 5 years of age is 58 per 1000 live births, significantly higher than the average for the country. adult respondents from each household were read a consent statement and asked to give verbal consent for their household's participation. the protocol for this study was reviewed and approved by the institutional review boards of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA) a case of severe respiratory illness, referred to as pneumonia, was defined as self-reported cough and difficulty breathing for two or more days or a physician-diagnosis of pneumonia. severe pneumonia was defined for children 3 years old who met the case definition as any of the following: blue lips and/or nails, convulsions, unconsciousness or decreased activity. the wealth index was categorized into quintiles with households weighted by number of residents and sample weights. we used the Wald Chi-square statistic to test for differences between proportions and logistic regression. results We approached 1200 households but residents could not be reached at 33 (3%) locations after three visits. 323 people (6%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 6-7%) met the case definition in the previous year. there were 60 cases (11%, 95% CI 9-13%) of pneumonia reported among children 5 years old, and 263 cases (6%, 95% CI 5-6%) among persons aged five years or older. the most common symptom besides feverishness (100%) was sore throat (97%), headache (89%) and cough (88%). the mean duration of illness among persons with ILI was seven days (range 1-90); more than half of person who reported an ILI had symptoms for seven days or more. pneumonia, with more children 5 years and adults 60 years old among the persons reporting pneumonia than among the surveyed population without pneumonia (P0.0001) there was no difference in household wealth between persons with and without pneumonia (P = 0.14) government clinics provided care to 65 (31%) persons with pneumonia aged five years or older, along with government ambulatory clinics. a considerable proportion (16%) of persons with pneumonia aged five years or older sought care at pharmacies. hospitals were consulted by 6 (5%) children 5 years old for ILI. 4 (5%) were hospitalized for one night or more. government clinics consulted for ILI by 111 (36%) persons aged five years or older. pneumonia (P = 0.37) or ILI (P = 0.25) was not associated with seeking care from a government facility (P = 0.13) the most common symptoms reported by persons with pneumonia were difficult breathing (100%), cough (99%), and feverishness (88%). the most common symptom besides feverishness (100%) was sore throat (97%), headache (89%) and cough (88%). signs of lower respiratory tract infection, such as difficult or fast breathing and wheezing, were less common among persons with ILI than those with pneumonia. the age distribution of those with ILI was younger than the surveyed population without ILI (P = 0.001) there was no difference in household wealth between persons with and without pneumonia (P = 0.14) more than one healthcare provider can be consulted in the course of an illness. 199 (73%) sought healthcare outside their home, with 21 (8%) seeking care from more than one source. private clinics provided care to 65 (31%) persons with pneumonia aged five years or older, along with government ambulatory clinics. 4 (5%) children 5 years old for ILI were hospitalized for one night or more. government clinics were consulted for ILI by 111 (36%) persons aged five years or older. one patient five years or older was hospitalized for more than one night. private clinics are the single most important source of healthcare for pneumonia. for more mild ILI, children 5 years old and persons aged five years or older are more likely to consult government clinics than other sources of health care. government healthcare clinics will underestimate the burden of disease by about 59% for children 5 years old and 64% for persons five years and older. our study is consistent with other studies of healthcare-seeking behavior in Guatemala and central America that have found private clinics to be common sources of healthcare. based on self-report, there is substantial potential for misclassification, especially between mild and severe acute respiratory illness. however, the behaviors associated with episodes of ILI compared to pneumonia are suggestive of a more mild illness. an additional limitation is our sample size, which is too small to permit age to be stratified into more than two groups. the authors would like to acknowledge the assistance of the health area of Santa Rosa for completing this survey. the Instituto Nacional de Estadstica de Guatemala kindly provided census maps and data to developing the sampling frame."}
