{"summary": "more than 20 TLRs clustered in six subfamilies have been identified. they provide a wide spectrum for recognizing the plethora of aquatic pathogens. no IRAK2 factor has yet been found in any teleostean fish species. toll-like receptors, nod1, and downstream factors as known from trout are listed with their GenBank accession numbers. different colors of the LRR regions factors indicate the membership to individual Tlr families. a Tlr4 ortholog is absent in salmonid fish (marked with a flash) the dominant MAMP from Gram-negative bacteria is lipopolysaccharide (LPS) no TLR4 ortholog has been identified so far in salmonid fish. modulation of expression pattern of entire TLR panel in response to A. salmonicida-infected rainbow trout has not been reported. a group of fish (n = 30) was infected by peritoneal injection with 200 L PBS (phosphate-buffered saline) containing 1 107 A. salmonicida. a control group received 200 L PBS only. RNA concentrations were determined with the nanoDrop 2000 photometer. 1.5 g total RNA from each sample was transcribed into cDNA using the super Script II kit. gene-specific antisense oligonucleotides were used in subsequent RT-qPCR reactions.

T cell receptor (trb) and immunoglobulin M, heavy chain (ighm) are broadly used gene markers indicating the presence of cells of the T- or B-type lineage. the trb level remained stable for 12 hpi and subsequently rose to its maximum 12-fold increase at 72 hpi. trb and ighm levels were all less than 3-fold and mostly statistically insignificant in the other three organs (thymus, spleen, and liver; Table 4). Changes of trb and ighm levels were all less than 3-fold. discussion Toll-like receptors are key components of the innate immune system promoting a proinflammatory state after invasion of pathogens. RT-qPCR is often the method of choice for the analysis due to the lack of fish-specific antibodies [26] and its superior sensitivity [40]. large differences have been reported regarding the organ-specific content of tlr-expressing IgM+ cells in trout [44]. pronounced upregulation of tlr expression after infection with relevant pathogens has been documented for mammals [21, 23], invertebrates [45, 46], and also bony fish. the broad spectrum of apparent \u201cligands\u201d for this factor suggests that its interaction with MAMPs can structurally not be similar to the sophisticated key-lock principal. trout Tlr22a2 senses some endogenous DAMPs resulting from Aeromonas-induced traumata rather than exogenous MAMPs. a prominent function of IRAK1 in mammals is its integration into the Myddosome. a prominent function of IRAK1 in mammals is its integration into the Myddosome. a prominent function of IRAK1 in mammals is its integration into the Myddosome. tlr22a2 was the most conspicuously Regulated tlr but Is Conceivably Not Specific for A. salmonicida recognition. the unique and quick sixfold upregulation of tlr22a2 already 6 hpi in head kidney would highlight this TLR as a candidate for specifically contributing to A. salmonicida recognition. the expression of the fish-specific tlr22 is known to be modulated by a variety of apparently unrelated signals. it was significantly upregulated in several tissues and immune cells after infection and/or stimulation. the broad spectrum of apparent \u201cligands\u201d for this factor suggests that its interaction with MAMPs can structurally not be similar to the sophisticated key-lock principal as known from mammalian TLRs interacting with their specific ligands. a prominent function of IRAK1 in mammals is its integration into the Myddosome. a prominent function of IRAK1 in mammals is its integration into the activated TIR domain of TLRs [8]. Irak1 plays a prominent role in controlling the activity of TLR signaling in trout. this almost instantaneous reaction against the invaders was in stark contrast to sluggish modulation of the expression of factors contributing to the TLR signaling cascade. no specific TLR could be singled out as a dominant receptor for perceiving the presence of A. salmonicida, albeit that Tlr22a2 was quickly and strongly induced after infection. however, this factor is known to be regulated by several nonrelated stimuli."}
