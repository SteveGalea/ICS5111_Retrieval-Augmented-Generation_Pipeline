{"summary": "chronic lower respiratory tract disease, defined as asthma, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), is the third leading cause of death in people aged 65 years and older. according to 2010 census data, 13% of the US population, or 40.3 million people, are older than age 65. a study of 55 nonsmoking women with variable degrees of thoracic kyphosis found that with increasing vertebral angle there was a significant decline in the fraction of exhaled volume in 1 second (FEV1) and vital capacity (VC) during spirometry testing. this effect was most significant once the kyphotic angle was over 55\u00b0. cough is a maneuver that requires generation of a high forced expiratory flow. the expiratory muscles contract to allow the lungs to take in a large tidal volume necessary to augment a sustained high expiratory flow. the mucus is expelled from the airway into the mouth. the upper airway nasal mucociliary cells work to remove large particles before they enter the smaller airways. the lower airway mucociliary cells remove fine particles from the airway over a longer period of time. age alone was negatively associated with airway clearance of radiolabeled particles at 1, 2, 7, 14 and 21 days. increased levels of interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor- (TNF) have been observed in aging rodent and human studies. linked to inflamm-aging is the blunted immune response, known as \u201cimmunosenescence\u201d following a pathogenic threat or tissue injury. microRNA 146a has been associated with a \u201csenescent associated proinflammatory status\u201d in the setting of vascular remodeling. these data support the relationship between inflamm-aging and immunosenescence, suggesting that a disruption in the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators results in a baseline proinflammatory environment with advanced age that dampens an appropriate innate and adaptive immune response. some studies on monocytes and macrophages report reduced expression of one or several TLRs. while some studies on monocytes and macrophages report reduced expression of one or several TLRs,34,49 another demonstrates alterations in downstream TLR signaling involving p36.51. inoculation of LPS into the respiratory tract of aged mice was associated with subsequent heightened levels of chemokines CXCL1 and CXCL2, IL-1. this may contribute to excessive tissue damage and reduced lung function over time. aging is associated with lower levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) dendritic cells (DCs) must migrate from sites of tissue injury and infection to local lymph nodes. chemokine ligand-21 is a key DC chemokine that is localized in lymph nodes and binds chemokine receptor type 7 and presents on DC cell membranes. Meyer et al looked at the ratio of CD4+ to CD8+ T cells in young versus old normal volunteers and found an increase in CD4+/CD8+ ratio as a function of age. this suggests there are fewer nave T cells available to be converted to memory cells in the face of a novel infection. the prevalence of COPD is two to three times higher in people over age 60. the global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease is the standard for the diagnosis and classification of COPD. the annual rate of decline after the age of 25 is 20 mL per year and further declines to a loss of 38 mL per year after age 65. the annual rate of decline after the age of 25 is 20 mL per year. cognitive impairments are common and associated with COPD in the elderly. anywhere between 42%\u201370% of aged persons with COPD have concomitant dementia or neurocognitive impairment."}
