{"summary": "in the past few decades alone, more than 85 emerging pathogens have been identified, including HIV, multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), west Nile Virus, Hanta virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), H1NI influenza, Middle Eastern Respiratory syndrome (MERS), Chikungunya virus, and, most recently, Ebola and Zika viruses. more than 65 non-governmental agencies sent health care volunteers to west africa to respond to the epidemic and to provide care to patients with Ebola virus disease. as of May 2016, over 11,000 deaths were reported among the estimated 28,000 suspected, probable or confirmed cases of Ebola. a recent survey of 177 voluntary health care organizations found that more than half accepted 75% or more of all health care applicants into their volunteer programs. a wide range of preparation provided to volunteers, from simply providing an 'orientation packet' of materials to extensive, in-person training. data were analyzed using qualitative techniques. potential participants were identified using a snowball sampling strategy. the purpose of the study was explained, as well as the study methods, the human subjects protections in place. two research team members reviewed the first three transcripts to develop a list of codes and a coding manual that defined the common terminology to describe the themes identified. the remaining transcripts were then inductively open-coded by two independent reviewers, followed by thematic analysis using the \u2018constant comparison\u2019 methodology. CDC began offering extensive training at a facility in Anniston, Alabama. some participants felt that they had not received adequate training. some participants felt that they had not received adequate training. some participants felt that they had not received adequate training. study participants thought their training did not address their perceived lack of cultural competency. peri-deployment First impressions By any measure and at multiple levels, the early humanitarian response to the Ebola epidemic was extraordinarily challenging. many patients were in the same room for extended periods with others who had died from EVD. some patients were not housed based on their health status but by the availability of beds (or, in some cases, cots or mattresses on the floor) in some ETUs, patients were not housed based on their health status. some participants felt emotionally withdrawn from their patients. fear of contagion and illnesses suggestive of EVD. many reported getting sick during their deployment. high heat and humidity made it impossible for most to work in the ETUs any longer than 2-3 hours. the PPE was also seen as a barrier to patient care. in the us, we adhere to basic and fundamental ethical principles of patient care. a key source of concern for many participants was witnessing undignified death. a physician recalled that 50% of patients on the [60-90 patient] ETU died... every day. the prevention of Ebola exposure was a common cause of concern for participants. one participant was the victim of a violent mugging: \"i got jumped and mugged and had everything stolen...passport, credit cards, everything... there were some bruises and what not, but it was more mentally what it did to me. i couldn\u2019t trust anyone anymore\" post-deployment Quarantine and sense of isolation Most participants reported that their reentry experiences were very stressful, as illustrated by the following recollection. one participant noted that she lost a lot of friends during the quarantine because, \"nobody would even pick up the phone... It was just awful\" at least one participant reported more positive experiences upon their return. participants felt 'anger' and'resentment' from their family and friends. some wanted validation of the risks they had taken by volunteering. the volunteers felt like heroes, and wanted to be appreciated for their volunteer efforts, but instead, some reported feeling stigmatized upon their return. one participant said that the attitude in the u.s. was, \"i\u2019m in the US and this doesn\u2019t involve me, so why should I care\" re-entry stress, self-doubt, disillusionment, re-entry stress, symptoms of PTSD, reflections Upon return, several participants started doubting the meaningfulness of their deployment. many were dismayed by the inequalities they saw between the US health care workers and local health care workers. reentry was really really rough. I spent a lot of time sitting in my office. others reported a loss of sense of purpose in life after returning. some positive experiences and feelings were noted. DISCUSSION In this study, we found important gaps in preparedness at each stage of deployment. one of the difficulties in making recommendations for improvement is determining who the recommendations should target. the international community, specifically, has a responsibility for ensuring efficient and rapid response to future outbreaks. 34 volunteers to hot zone missions need to know what to expect upon initial reentry into the US. CDC has an important role to play to help reduce stigmatization of returning volunteers. sponsoring organizations also have a responsibility in assuring that there are support systems in place for volunteers. a list of non-governmental organizations that meet certain criteria is maintained by the national Voluntary Organization Active in Disaster (NVOAD) sponsors should have proven track records of effective humanitarian medical response missions in resource-poor countries. they must also provide a clear understanding of what the volunteer\u2019s roles and responsibilities are likely to be. potential volunteers should avail themselves and their families of the many excellent no-cost training basic disaster preparedness programs. ebola/hcp/safety-training-course/continuing-education.html OSHA - PPE Assessment https://www.osha.gov/dte/library/ppe_assessment/ppe_assessment.html Patient Care & Ethics AHRQ - Altered standards of care in mass casualty events http://archive.ahrq.gov/research/altstand/altstand.pdf CA Hospital Emergency Preparedness - Crisis the responsibility of the sponsor should not end when the volunteer\u2019s tour of duty ends. if volunteers have to be quarantined upon their return home, the sponsor should ensure they have policies and protocols in place to support the volunteer during quarantine. studies are warranted to develop and evaluate best practices preparedness programs for high risk medical missions. there is also a need to assess pre-deployment counseling on health and mental health outcomes in medical volunteers. the challenges of delivering care under extremely constrained conditions may be overwhelming for some people. the heroism of ebola mission volunteers was appropriately honored by the 2014 Times \u2018Person of the Year Award\u2019. the authors declare that they have no competing interests. the authors declare that they have no competing interests. volunteer preparedness varied from comprehensive training in aniston GA to simply being handed a brochure about EVD. all relief agencies have a moral obligation to provide adequate preparation of volunteers before deployment, and the host country should demand it. the host country and lead NGO agency should agree beforehand on a version of incident command that will be used to support the response. all other response agencies and volunteers should be trained on this incident response structure. the lack of resources in all categories (personal, space, supplies, equipment, policies, utilities, water) was a shock and disturbing. a high degree of host country and NGO coordination, cooperation and communication goes a long way to assure an environment that supports worker safety. Efforts to assure volunteer safety serve to increase access to larger numbers of qualified volunteers. volunteers must be provided with personal safety training which includes relative risks, curfew hours, travel in groups, local customs regarding gender behavior, manners, dress and communication. basic emergency preparedness training can better prepare volunteers to understand the need for fluidity in terms of standards of care. volunteers should be provided with updates regarding the resource situation and expected standards of care on a daily basis by the on-site Operations Commander. a controversial issue that will persist for events such as EVD. the risks to volunteers should be assessed and honestly reported by the appropriate US governmental agencies to the populace. standards of management of returning volunteers should be made by the CDC, so that those who are quarantined are treated humanely. NGOs have an obligation to assure the safety of the volunteers to the extent possible. this includes support for the volunteers\u2019 post-deployment so that their re-entry can be supported. the US should fund research that examines factors related to volunteer emotional protection and safety."}
