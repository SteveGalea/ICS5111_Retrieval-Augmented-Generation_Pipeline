{"summary": "Background Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (APP) is one of the most important swine pathogens worldwide. we use an immunoproteomic approach to identify APP protein antigens that may elicit an immune response in serotype 1 naturally infected swine. the traditional chemically-[2,3], genetically-, and irradiation-inactivated whole cell vaccines used thus far have been shown to provide protection against a homologous challenge from APP. some cross-serovar protection has been achieved with live-attenuated vaccines of mutant strains of APP serovar 7 [5] and serovar 1 [6,7] further development of cross-serovar vaccines would benefit from a molecular understanding of serotype 1 naturally infected swine and serotype 1 virulent strain S259-immunized rabbits. this approach combines the specificity of antibody detection with the precision of mass spectral analysis [19] for identifying antigenic bacterial proteins. all identified protein spots were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. western blot analysis of proteins on 2DE gel as transferred to a PVDF membrane. primary antibodies were convalescent sera from swine naturally infected with APP serotype. digital images of the western blots and Ponceau S-stained membranes were compared with the 2DE gels. we found 42 immunoreactive protein spots that represented 32 different proteins. the identified spots were labeled on each gel (Figures 1, 2, 3 and 4) immunoreactive proteins identified with convalescent sera from swine naturally infected APP serotype 1 Spot No. Protein No. Protein Identified Theoretical MW/pI Experimental MW/pI Peptide match PSORTb localization PSORTb Probabilitya Mowse scoreb APs1 gi|307245438 Polyribonucleotide nucleotidyltransferase 77.439 Cytoplasmic 9.97 297 APs11 gi|53728830 Translation elongation factors (GTPases) 77.515/5.10 94.6/5.11 41 (67%) Cytoplasmic 9.97 356 APs12 gi|46143894 TPR repeat 55.365/9.45 97.6/5.54 28 (62%) Unknown 373 APs13 gi|46143698 Sugar transferases involved in lipopoly APs21 gi|126207895 protective surface antigen D15 precursor 89.088/6.30 89.1/6.31 36 (47%) OuterMembrane 10 302 APs22 gi|307245243 Protective surface antigen D15 89.172/6.30 89.2/6.22 21 (28%) OuterMembrane 10 152 APs23 gi|303252337 DNA topoisomerase III 7 immunoreactive proteins identified with hyperimmune sera raised in an S259-immunized rabbit Spot No. Protein No. Protein Identified Theoretical MW/pI Experimental MW/pI Peptide match (sequence coverage, %) PSORTb localization PSORTb Probabilitya Mowse scoreb APr4 gi|32034816 Ribosomal protein L7/L12 12.322/4.72 10.8/4. the values are localization probabilities (from 0 to 10) mowse score is the score based on the mowse algorithm in Mascot. protein scores > 83 are significant (p 0.05) no specific immunoreactive protein spots were observed when negative control sera were used. the primary antibodies were convalescent sera from swine naturally infected with APP serotype 1. all identified protein spots were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS.
