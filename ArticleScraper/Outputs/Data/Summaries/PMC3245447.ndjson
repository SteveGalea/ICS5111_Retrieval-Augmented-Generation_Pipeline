{"summary": "group A rotaviruses (GARs) are the most common etiological agent of severe diarrhea in infants and young children worldwide. their genome consists of 11 segments of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) encased in a triple-layered capsid. these segments encode six structural (VP1-VP4, VP6, and VP7) and five or six non-structural proteins. the outer capsid proteins VP7 and VP4 independently a number of new G and P genotypes have recently been identified in animals. GARs pose an economic threat to the pig industry due to poor growth performance. the only means of prevention is hygiene management. RNA extraction Fecal specimens were diluted with Eagle's minimum essential medium to 10% suspensions and clarified by centrifugation at 1 500 g for 10 min. total RNA was extracted from 250 L of the fecal suspensions using TRIzol LS (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA, USA) the gels were stained using a Silver Stain Plus kit. VP4 genes were purified using microSpin S-400 HR Columns. the purified PCR products were used as a template for sequencing on an Applied Biosystems 3100 automated DNA sequencer. primers TJ4-1 494F (5'-GTA ACC CAA TGG ACA TTA CAC TG-3') and TJ4-1 368R (5'-CTA CTG AAA ATG ATG CGA TGT C-3') were also used as sequencing primer a total of 28 fecal samples (one sample per litter, 5 to 11 samples per outbreak) were collected from the rectum of diarrheal pigs that had not been treated with antibiotics. all animal experiments were approved by the Animal Ethical Committee and the Animal Care and Use Committee of National Institute of Animal Health. RT-PCR The GAR VP7 gene and the VP8* fragment of the VP4 gene were amplified using a QIAGEN OneStep RT-PCR kit. amplicons were analyzed in agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by UV after ethidium bromide staining. the sequences were assembled, edited, and analyzed using MEGA 4 software. gene distances were calculated using the Kimura-2 correction parameter. phylogenic dendrograms were constructed with 1 000 bootstrap replications. nucleotide sequence accession numbers were submitted to GenBank. 80% of the samples collected at each outbreak were positive for GARs, as determined by RT-PCR targeting VP7. GAR was the most common enteropathogen associated with the repeated outbreaks of diarrhea and most likely the cause. the sample was negative for GAR by RNA-PAGE. the nucleotide sequences could not be determined. RNA-PAGE found no samples to be infected with more than one GAR strain. VP7 genes with those of 25 established G genotypes led to classification of the 15 GAR strains into four genotypes: G9, G3, G5, and an untypeable G genotype. phylogenic trees based on partial nucleotide sequences of VP7 genes from GAR strains identified in this study and those of representative or selected strains of each genotype. nucleotide identities for the eleven strains were 99.4% to 100% compared to each other, 90.6% to 93.2% to the old Japanese porcine G9 isolates. the two G3 strains TJ3-1 and TJ3-2, both of which were identified at the third outbreak, constituted a separate branch distantly related to porcine G3 strains. a BLAST search analysis found the nucleotide identities of its VP7 gene were 93.1% compared to 57vp7w, the uncommon human G3 strain identified in Thailand. we characterized the TJ4-1 strain by analyzing the complete coding sequence of the VP7 gene. the highest identity was to the G3 RRV strain (80.2% nucleotide identity and 87.5% amino acid identity), with lower nucleotide and amino acid the reference strains are shown with host species/strain name/G genotype. the highest identity to the reference strain is shown in bold. BLAST search analysis and phylogenic analysis of these VP4 genes with those of 33 established P genotypes led to classification of the 13 GAR strains into three genotypes. eight P[23] strains were identified, with six strains detected at the first outbreak, one at the second, and one at the fourth (Table 2). These strains had nucleotide identities of 99.7% to 100% compared to each other. the GenBank accession numbers of the strains used in the phylogenic tree are listed in Additional file 2, Table S2. one P[13]/[22] strain identified at the second outbreak (TJ2-1) and one at the fourth (TJ4-5) showed low nucleotide identity (80.3%) with each other. 9P[13]/[22] strains were closely related to each other genetically, they combined with different P genotypes. the VP4 genes from the G3P[7] and G26P[7] strains were highly homologous, yet they combined with different G genotypes. electropherotype and combination of G and P genotypes detected in samples collected at each diarrheal outbreak. the sample was negative for GAR by RNA-PAGE, but the nucleotide sequences could not be determined. electropherotypes were classified into six electropherotypes designated eI to eVI. RNA-PAGE found no samples to be infected with more than one GAR strain. a different electropherotype was observed in each outbreak. trees based on the partial nucleotide sequences of the VP7 genes from G9 (b), G3 (c) and G5 (d) strains identified in this study are shown in bold italic. the strains obtained using GenBank are shown with host species/strain name/genotype and lineage. the nucleotide identities of its VP7 gene were 100% compared to each other, 87.6% to 91.6% to the porcine G3 strains comprising lineage I. the G5 isolate TJ4-5, identified at the fourth outbreak, constituted a separate branch distantly related to human and porcine G5 strains comprising lineage III. the nucleotide identities of its VP7 gene were 86.3% to 90.3% compared to the G5 strain the highest identity was to the G3 RRV strain (80.2% nucleotide identity and 87.5% amino acid identity), with lower nucleotide and amino acid identities to other strains ranging from 61.1% to 78.1%, and 57.2% to 85.5% respectively. the RCWG employs a cutoff value of 80% nucleotide identity to define a novel G genotype. the reference strains are shown with host species/strain name/G genotype. abbreviations for host species are shown in the legend of Figure 2. The highest identity to the reference strain is shown in bold. two P[7] strains (TJ3-1 and TJ3-2) were identified at the third outbreak and one at the fourth, having 99.7% to 100% sequence identities with each other. they were clustered in one branch related to the porcine OSU strain and in another to porcine and bovine P[7] strains. longed to a lineage comprised of porcine P[13]/[22] strains of Japanese origin (GUB72, FGP28 and FGP36) and global origin (CMP178 and HP140) with 83.3% to 84.6% nucleotide identity. the TJ4-5 strain was clustered with the porcine P[13]/[22] strains of Ireland origin (2B/05/Ire) and Japanese origin (JP35-7 and JP13-3) strains identified in this study displayed marked genetic variation compared to others around the world as well as older Japanese strains. despite these limitations, we found at least five different G/P combinations and six electropherotypes during the four outbreaks. the onset age and diarrhea severity are influenced by management practices that affect these factors, such as housing type, sanitation, and crate design. the variation in affected pigs across the outbreaks appears to reflect the variation in the level of lactogenic immunity passed from sows to piglets. 57vp7w may be a porcine-human reassortant or a porcine strain. the newly identified G26 has been detected in both pigs and humans. further surveillance and epidemiological study on GARs in domestic animals will be needed to better understand the origin and circulation of human GARs. members of the Rotavirus Classification Working Group appreciate their input regarding strain classification and the identification of the novel VP7 genotype. the work was supported by a research grant from the National Institute of Animal Health, Japan."}
