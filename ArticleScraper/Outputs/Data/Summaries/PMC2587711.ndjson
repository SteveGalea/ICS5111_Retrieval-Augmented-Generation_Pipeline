{"summary": "more than 90% of epidemic nonbacterial gastroenteritis worldwide can be attributed to human noroviruses. infection is transmitted fecal-orally, and symptomatic infection is characterized by nausea, vomiting and/or diarrhea lasting 24\u201348 hours within 24 hours of exposure. the elderly and individuals in long-term care facilities may be more susceptible to either norovirus infection or norovirus-induced disease. studies using norwalk Virus (GI), Snow Mountain Virus (GII) and HuNoV-HS66 (GII) VLPs to evaluate immunity after infection with live virus or immunization with VLPs orally show production of T cell effector cytokines. cytokines such as IL-2 and interferon (IFN-) and proliferation of norovirus specific T cells after in vitro restimulation with VLPs. studies of MNV pathogenesis reveal an important role for interferon and STAT-1 mediated innate immunity in resistance to infection and MNV induced lethality. titers in tissues of infected mice have not been reported to exceed 106 PFU/ml. the significance of these differences is not known. studies of norovirus infection in human volunteers have not specifically investigated whether the infection spreads beyond the intestine to the local lymph nodes. however, it is possible that systemic invasion occurs in humans with chronic conditions or immunosuppressed hosts. the effects of specific immune cell types were tissue specific, differing between ileum and mesenteric lymph nodes. these are the first studies to demonstrate immune mechanisms responsible for norovirus clearance and vaccination. we first determined whether we could detect short-term immunity to homologous MNV challenge. similar decreases were observed in the MLN after vaccination with MNV1.CW1 (p = 0.0001) or MNV1.CW3 (p = 0.0003) compared to the reovirus controls. there was no statistically significant difference between vaccination with MNV1.CW1 or MNV1.CW3. HA controls were not significantly different from PBS controls across all experiments. HA VRP controls were not significantly different from PBS controls across all experiments. vaccine with either live virus or ORF2 VRPs can confer short-term protection. older adults may be more susceptible than younger adults to norovirus infection or disease [5], we determined whether increased age altered vaccine efficacy. prior work has shown that mice older than 1 year of age have diminished vaccine responses to SARS virus antigens. adult and aged mice were vaccinated and challenged as before. live virus vaccination conferred full protection against MNV1.CW3 replication in both the distal ileum and the MLN at four, 14 and 24 weeks after vaccine boost. both live virus and subunit vaccine induce long-term protection against MNV infection, with live virus vaccination providing more complete protection. unless otherwise stated, live virus vaccinations are compared to vaccination with reovirus. there was considerable variation in the efficacy of vaccination in both the distal ileum and the MLN of B cell-/- mice. only 2 out of 15 mice had any titer and those two mice had less than 100 PFU of MNV. in MHC Class II-/- mice, there were detectable titers in both tissues (Figure 3B and 3C) these data are pooled from three independent experiments with 3\u20135 mice per group in each experiment. unless otherwise stated, live virus vaccinations are compared to vaccination with reovirus. LD indicates the limit of detection. LD indicates the limit of detection. there was no significant difference in viral titer between MHC class I2M-/-mice and WT mice at three and five days post-infection. however, at seven days post-infection, MHC class I2M-/- mice had significant levels of MNV titers in both the distal ileum and the MLN. depletion of CD4 and CD8 T cells was at least 90% effective as assessed by flow cytometry of isolated splenocytes. depletion of CD4 and CD8 T cells led to a significant increase in MNV titers in both the distal ileum and the MLN. LD indicates the limit of detection. CD4 and CD8 T cells are important for efficient clearance of MNV infection in both the MLN and distal ileum. CD8 T cells function later in infection than CD4 T cells. transfer of immune, but not non-immune, splenocytes significantly reduced MNV titer in the duodenum/jejunum (p0.0001) and distal ileum (p0.0001) six days post-transfer. so, adoptively transferred immune splenocytes were sufficient to clear persistent MNV infection in the intestine of RAG1-/- mice. depletion of either CD4 or CD8 T cells individually led to a significant increase in MNV titers in duodenum/jejunum compared to control depletion. both immune CD4 and CD8 T cells were necessary for clearance of persistent MNV infection from the intestine. duodenum/jejunum (p = 0.0086) or distal ileum (p = 0.0001). perforin was critical for efficient clearance of MNV infection from the intestine. if we could detect short-term immunity to homologous MNV challenge, proteins encoded by specific MNV ORFs could elicit effective immunity. similar decreases were observed in the MLN after vaccination with MNV1.CW1 (p = 0.0001) or MNV1.CW3 (p = 0.0003) compared to control VRPs expressing hemagglutinin (HA) from a. there was no statistically significant difference between vaccination with MNV1.CW1 or MNV1.CW3. adapted influenza A virus [41] (HA VRP control group) controls for VRP vaccination also included PBS. HA VRP controls were not significantly different from PBS controls across all experiments. HA VRP controls were not significantly different from PBS controls. vaccinated aged mice had significantly lower anti-MNV ORF2 IgG compared to adult mice. despite this protective effect, sera from vaccinated aged mice had significantly lower anti-MNV ORF2 IgG compared to adult mice. mice were primed and boosted as shown in Figure 2A with MNV1.CW3. live virus vaccination conferred full protection against MNV1.CW3 replication in both the distal ileum and the MLN at four, 14 and 24 weeks after vaccine boost. both live virus and subunit vaccine induce long-term protection against MNV infection, with live virus vaccination providing more complete protection. the MLN of B cell-/-, MHC Class II-/- and MHC Class I2M-/- mice was p0.05 in all cases. however, there was considerable variation in the efficacy of vaccination in distal ileum and MLN between different immunodeficient strains. MLN of B cell-/, MHC Class II-/-, and MHC Class I2M-/- mice after MNV1.CW3 challenge following short-term vaccination with the indicated vaccines. these data are pooled from three independent experiments with 3\u20135 mice per group in each experiment. LD indicates the limit of detection. there was no significant difference in viral titer between MHC class I2M-/-mice and WT mice at three and five days post-infection. however, at seven days post-infection, MHC class I2M-/- mice had significant levels of MNV titers in both the distal ileum and the MLN (p0.0001) phenotypes we observed in MHC class I2M-/- and MHC class II-/- mice were due to abnormal immune ontogeny in knockout mice. depletion of CD4 and CD8 T cells was at least 90% effective as assessed by flow cytometry of isolated splenocytes. this depletion protocol is effective at depleting T cells in secondary lymphoid organs and the intestine. CD4 and CD8 T cells from vaccinated mice are important for clearance of MNV infection in both the MLN and distal ileum. they function later in infection than CD4 T cells, most important at days six and seven. LD indicates the limit of detection. transfer of immune, but not non-immune, splenocytes significantly reduced MNV titer in the duodenum/jejunum and distal ileum six days post-transfer. adoptively transferred immune splenocytes were sufficient to clear persistent MNV infection in the intestine of RAG1-/- mice. pletion of either CD4 or CD8 T cells individually led to a significant increase in MNV titers in duodenum/jejunum compared to control depletion. depletion of either CD4 depletion alone (p = 0.02) or CD8 depletion alone (p = 0.03) led to a significant additional increase in MNV titers. perforin was critical for efficient clearance of MNV infection from the intestine. but it was not the only relevant effector mechanism. we define mechanisms of immunity to norovirus infection as measured by both vaccination against, and clearance of, mucosal infection. antiviral effector perforin is important in clearance of MNV from the intestine. it is possible that other cell types such as NK cells might also use perforin as a mechanism to control MNV infection. this suggests that the cytotoxic T cell response is a key effector mechanism. protective epitopes exist outside of the capsid protein. vaccination with VP1 via the subcutaneous route provided significant protection. a mucosal vaccine may not be necessary to vaccinate against norovirus infection. the lack of comparable variation in MNV strains limits the utility of the MNV model for assessing immunity to antigenically distinct strains. the second aspect of murine norovirus infection that is of unknown relevance to human infection is the impressive capacity of MNV to infect lymph nodes draining the intestine. there was significant, but incomplete, protection in MHC class II-/- mice. there was significant, but incomplete, protection in MHC class II-/- mice. differences in viral tropism in the two tissues might explain the differential requirement for B cells between ileum and MLN. type I Lang reovirus was concentrated by centrifugation at 4\u00b0C for 3 h at 27,000 rpm (90,000 g) in a SW32 rotor. pellets were resuspended in PBS and titered on RAW 264.7 cells. monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific to CD4 (YTS191.1 [61] and CD8 (H35 [62]) and SFR3-DR5 (ATCC HB-151 [63] were produced from hybridoma cell lines in INTEGRA Celline CL1000 flasks. mice were bred and housed at Washington University School of Medicine or the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in accordance with federal and university policies. mice used in vaccination studies were immunized with 3107 PFU of MNV1.CW1 [28], MNV1.CW3 [31], or control Type I Lang reovirus per orally (p.o.) mice were challenged with 3107 PFU of MNV1.CW3 at specified times after boost and tissues harvested three days post-challenge. splenocyte donor mice were infected with 3106 PFU of MNV1.CW3 p.o. in 25 l of cDMEM. all other mice were infected with 3107 PFU of MNV1.CW3 p.o. intraperitoneal injection in 0.5ml cRPMI injected into persistently infected RAG1-/- mice. 500 g of lymphocyte-depleting antibody or an isotype-matched control antibody was administered i.p. one day prior and one day after infection. depleting antibodies were administered to RAG1-/- recipients. supernatants were clarified by low-speed centrifugation for 20 min at 3,000 rpm. Virus was concentrated by centrifugation at 4\u00b0C for 3 h at 27,000 rpm. pellets were resuspended in PBS and titered on RAW 264.7 cells. cell lysates from MNV ORF2, Chiba virus and Lordsdale virus VRP-infected cell cultures were further purified to obtain VLPs. monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific to CD4 (YTS191.1 [61] and CD8 (H35 [62]) were produced from hybridoma cell lines in INTEGRA Celline CL1000 flasks. mice were a generous gift of Dr. Ted Hansen (Washington University, St Louis, MO) all mice (or cage sentinel mice for mice deficient in antibody production) were tested by ELISA for the presence of MNV antibody prior to experiments [27]. HA controls were not significantly different from PBS controls in all experiments. all other mice were infected with 3106 PFU of MNV1.CW3 p.o. in 25 l of cDMEM. in all other mice the distal ileum and three mesenteric lymph nodes were harvested. 1107 cells were injected into persistently infected RAG1-/- mice by intraperitoneal injection in 0.5ml cRPMI. 500 g of lymphocyte-depleting antibody or an isotype-matched control antibody was administered i.p. one day prior and one day after infection. VRP-ORF1 infected cells revealed a band corresponding in size to the cleaved RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (57 kDa) purified MNV VLPs from cell lysates yielded a single 57 kDa band corresponding to the capsid."}
