{"summary": "flavivirus virions present a positive single-stranded RNA genome of approximately 11 Kb with a single open reading frame. RNA genome encodes one polyprotein, which is further cleaved in 3 structural (C, prM and E) and 7 non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5) classical virus PRNT was first described in the 1950s. it is considered the gold standard to measure neutralizing antibodies against viruses. it is laborious and therefore not readily amenable to high-throughput. D1-4G2-4-15 hybridoma was cultivated in RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco/Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA) with 25 mM HEPES. supplemented with 10% FBS, 1 mM sodium piruvate, 250 ng/ml amphotericin B and 100 IU/ml penicillin/streptomycin. 29 positive sera for ZIKV were confirmed by IgM ELISA and/or real time RT-PCR; 30 IgG sera positive for DENV confirmed with Panbio IgG indirect ELISA. 95 IgM sera positive for DENV (from all serotypes), confirmed by IgM capture ELISA and RT-PCR. a panel of 53 samples positive for other acute infections was tested. MC and 10% FBS in DMEM/F-12 medium were added. plates were left at 37\u00b0C for 6 days and cells were stained with 0.75% crystal violet. antibody titer was determined as the serum dilution that inhibited 90% of the tested virus inoculum. antigens (ZIKV or Mock) were derived from -propiolactone inactivated cell-culture supernatant from non-infected and ZIKV infected cells. human RNAse P was used as endogenous control. cells and virus C6/36 Aedes albopictus cells (ATCC CRL-1660) were grown in leibovitz L-15 medium (Gibco/Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco/Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA) and 0.26% tryptose (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, deNV2- ICC 265 and DENV3- BR DEN 97\u201304 were isolated in brazil. to obtain viral stocks, virus were propagated in C6/36 at the multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01. serum samples were inactivated at 56\u00b0C for 30 min, and then diluted 1/20. an equal volume of virus suspension containing 210 plaque-forming units (pfu) was mixed with diluted samples and incubated at room temperature for 1h. cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde and stained with 0.75% crystal violet. wells were washed three times with blocking buffer (PBS with 1% BSA) and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1h. cell nuclei were counterstained with 5 M DRAQ5. assay quality was assessed by Z\u2019 = 1\u2013 [3(p+n)/(p- n)], where is the standard deviation, is the mean of both positive (p) and negative (n) controls. results were considered when Z\u2019 was higher than 0.5 [16]. Neutralization curves were obtained using the software Prism. the data presented are the average results of three independent experiments. Huh 7.5, a human-derived hepatoma cell line, was chosen for the neutralization assays. it is permissive to ZIKV and other flavivirus infection. negative and positive samples were tested in three independent assays. it was observed a low variation for the negative (0.93 0.16) and for the positive samples (188.46 3.01), showing the robustness of the test. a total of 226 serum samples, among then negative and positive for flavivirus and non-flavivirus infections, were examined. neutralization titers that inhibit 90% of viral infection (NT90) are shown in the graph. early infection (serum PCR positive and variable anti-ZIKV IgM) and late infection (PCR negative and variable anti-ZIKV IgM) samples presented low neutralizing titers. NT90 of PCR negative /IgM positive samples ranged from 20.98 to 581.80. sample (LRV/16 1249) LRV/16 1058 Positive Negative 334.20 ZIKV PCR+ paired sample (LRV/16 1263) LRV/16 1074 Inconclusive Negative 180.50 ZIKV PCR+ paired sample (LRV/16 1253) LRV/16 1243 Positive Negative 163.60 DENV IgM negative LRV/16 1255 Positive Negative 40.32 DENV IgM negative LRV/16 1255 95 DENV positive samples were tested in MAC-ELISA format assay and the fluorescent neutralization test. the panel is composed by paired samples and viral isolation during acute phase of infection was used as \u201cgold standard\u201d for DENV infection. the test was adapted to identify neutralization antibodies to dengue virus. the same standardization steps used previously were employed to develop a test for the four serotypes of DENV. ZIKV strain ZV BR 2015/15261 was chosen because it is a recent Brazilian clinical isolate. a kinetic of virus growth was performed between the third and tenth day after infection. four images per well (representative of the whole well) were acquired with the Operetta High-Content Imaging System and analyzed with the Harmony Analysis Software (PerkinElmer) after the standardization step, we proceeded to the neutralization assay. a correlation of 0.88 was obtained (P = 0.0003). the new proposed test was validated with a set of serum samples previously tested. a total of 226 serum samples were submitted to the fluorescent neutralization test and the NT90 was calculated. a titer higher than 10 is supposed to be considered positive for ZIKV. but several IgM positive samples for dengue would be erroneous considered positive for ZIKV.

IgM DENV positive samples tested by MAC-ELISA, 39 cross-reacted and presented false positive results for ZIKV and 25 were inconclusive or undetermined. the novel neutralization test presented 50.53% less cross reactivity than MAC-ELISA, and the rate of correct identification of ZIKV negative serum increased from 32.63% to 83.16%. a definitive ZIKV diagnosis is achieved by detecting viral RNA in patient serum, or other samples like urine, semen and placenta. a serologic test must be employed for individuals beyond this viremia window. the most common method is the detection of reactive IgM antibodies. novel ELISA based on recombinant ZIKV non-structural protein 1 (NS1) was able to eliminate cross-reactions with antibodies to DENV and other flaviviruses. a CDC diagnostic guideline recommends that presumptive positive or equivocal MAC-ELISA result for ZIKV needs to be verified with a confirmatory PRNT. the assay maintained relative specificity of traditional PRNT. it was further evaluated with 258 clinical serum specimens. a neutralization assay in which the endpoint is measured by real-time PCR was proposed. people exposed to secondary DENV infections develop broadly neutralizing antibodies that neutralize different serotypes other than the one responsible for current infection [31]. sera from patients with secondary DENV infection exhibit potent cross-reactivity against ZIKV [11], as it was demonstrated in the DENV fluorescent neutralization test. higher cut off values may reduce assay sensibility, i.e., some samples of ZIKV early infections can become inconclusive. the developed fluorescent neutralization test offers significant advantages over classical PRNT. it is faster, prompt to high throughput adaptation, has automated reading of results."}
