{"summary": "DMD is the most prevalent and severe form of childhood muscle wasting. a cited incidence of 1 in 3,500 live-male births, whereas BMD is a clinically milder form of the disease with slower disease progression. intermediate muscular dystrophy has been used to describe \"mildly affected\" patients. the pathogenic basis of particular in-frame dystrophin deletions reflects the number of exons lost. other in-frame deletions may have severe consequences, due to the loss of a crucial functional domain within dystrophin, eg the actin or beta-dystroglycan binding regions. dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex reveals moderate dystrophic changes in diaphragm. excision of Dmd exon 5 greatly reduced dystrophin expression in mouse diaphragm. removing an in-frame exon carrying an intra-exonic protein truncating mutation would allow synthesis of functional dystrophin isoforms. fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 20% foetal calf serum (FCS) (Serana, Bunbury Australia), 1% GlutaMaxTM-I (Gibco Life Technologies, Melbourne, Australia), 10 U/mL penicillin (Invitrogen), 10 mg/ML streptomycin (Life Technologies) and 250 ng/mL amphotericin B (Sigma-Aldrich, Sydney, Australia) a panel of splice switching AOs was developed to excise mouse dystrophin exon 5. the 2\u2019-O-methyl modified oligomer 5\u2019 UAU GAU UUC CAU CAU CAU CAU CUA CUA UGU CAG UGC UUC 3\u2019 was identified to efficiently remove the target exon 5 in vitro. myogenic cells were transfected 3 days after the initiation of myogenic differentiation. the 23mer AO complexed with Lipofectamine 2000\u00ae (1:1 w/w) in Opti-MEM media (Gibco) the cells were then incubated at 37\u00b0C for 3 days before RNA extraction. the total RNA was extracted using Trizol\u00ae (Life Technologies) PCR primers were designed to generate amplicons of approximately 3kb across introns 4 (21.4 kb) and 5 (6.6kb) to localize the breakpoints in the flanking introns. amplicons from normal and exon 5-deleted dystrophin genes were fractionated on 2% agarose gels.

Bothell, Oregon, was re-injected into C57BL/10ScSn mice (n = 5). mice were given twice weekly intraperitoneal injections of 5-PPMOk at 20 mg/kg. the mice were anaesthetised (IP, sodium pentobarbitone 40mg/kg) a week after completing the treatment regimen, sampled for physiological testing and then killed via cervical dislocation. gel densitometry was used to estimate relative myosin expression. samples (5 l containing 7.5g total protein per lane) were loaded onto a 3% - 10% gradient SDS\u2013polyacrylamide electrophoresis (PAGE) gel with a 3% stacking gel and run at 30 mA for 2h. proteins were then electro-blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane overnight at 290 mA in transfer buffer. immunochemistry was performed on unfixed serial cryosections (7m thick) from all the mice, stained with either monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies diluted in PBST containing 10% normal goat serum. collagen staining with picro-sirius red is based on the method described by Puchtler, 1973 [27] negative controls were prepared by substituting the primary antiserum with PBST containing rabbit immunoglobulin fraction (DakoCytomation X0936), diluted to match final immunoglobulin concentration on duplicate serial sections. images were captured on an Olympus DP70 digital camera (Olympus Australia Pty Ltd, Sydney, Australia) and photographed at 10x and 20x magnification. each set of serial sections were photographed in batches and exposed under the same settings to the patient and normal fibroblasts were seeded at 3 x 104 cells/well. the 24 well plates were pre-coated with 50 g/mL poly D-lysine (Sigma) and 100 g/mL Matrigel (VWR, Brisbane, Australia) for 1 hour each. a panel of splice switching AOs was developed to excise mouse dystrophin exon 5. this sequence was synthesized as a phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer coupled to the cell penetrating peptide k [22] (PPMO) for in vivo experiments. the underlined sequence (M5A(+20+49) was synthesised as a phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer coupled to the cell penetrating peptide k [22]. RNA pellet resuspended in 30 L of sterile water (Baxter Healthcare, Australia) 100 ng of total RNA was used as template for the initial reverse transcriptase PCR reaction (55\u00b0C for 30 minutes) using Superscript\u00ae III One-step RT-PCR (35 cycles) of 94\u00b0C, 55\u00b0C and 72\u00b0C for 0.5, 1 and 2 minutes respectively. a 1 L aliquot from the primary reaction was then used as template for the approximate locations of breakpoints in introns 4 and 5 were identified by comparison of normal and patient DNA. additional primers were designed to sequence the intron 4:5 junction using BigDye sequencing chemistry.

NCL DYS-1 (upper middle row, specific for the carboxy-terminus) and NCL-DYS 3 (lower middle row, specific for the amino-terminus) and spectrin (lower row) on patient cryosections. exon Subsequent amplification of patient DNA with HIn4 F4 and the reverse primer targeted to exon 6 (HEx6ROuter) generated an amplicon of about 5.4 kb, while long range PCR of the normal dystrophin gene using these primers generated a product in excess of 16 kb. the 5.4 kb patient-derived amplicon was used as a DNA sequencing template with primers shown in Table 4. the predominant amplicon after RT-PCR of patient muscle RNA across DMD exons 1\u201310 was missing only exon 5, and there was no evidence of any DMD transcripts missing exon 6 in the patient cells. the efficiency of exon 6 skipping after transfection was similar in both cell strains. ioate backbone was designed to anneal to mouse dystrophin exon 5 bases 20 to 49. this sequence was synthesized as a PMO conjugated to a cell penetrating peptide for in vivo studies in wild type mice. a dystrophic phenotype, induced by skipping of Dmd exon 5 was evident in the diaphragms, although the dystrophic pathology was quite as marked as for the sham treated fibrosis is apparent in 5-PPMOk treated C57BL10 and sham treated mdx mice. dystrophin carboxy terminus (NCL DYS-2), -dystroglycan (-Dys), neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and developmental myosin heavy chain (NCL-MHCd) dystrophin was assessed by densitometry after normalization to myosin heavy chain expression. RT-PCR across Dmd exons 1\u20137 on RNA extracted from diaphragm of 5-PPMOk and sham treated C57BL10 mice showed efficient skipping of exon 5. the percentage of dystrophin, relative to the wild type control, was assessed by densitometry. the diagnostic laboratory undertook analysis of limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) genes and found no sequence variants for CAPN3. the autosomal recessive LGMD genes, FKRP, DYSF, TCAP, TRIM32, TTN, SGCA, SGCA, SGCB, SGCE and SGCG. a heterozygous change was found in ANO5 exon 15 (undocumented variant of uncertain clinical significance spectrin immunostaining of the sarcolemma shows muscle fibres of irregular size. normal muscle section shows muscle fibres of very regular size and shape. staining intensity for alpha-sarcoglycan, merosin, alpha-dystroglycan, collagen VI, dysferlin, caveolin, lamin A/C and emerin appeared normal. deletion breakpoints in introns 4 and 5 were identified by generating 3 kb amplicons across the introns. amplification with primer combinations HIn4 F4-R5 to HIn5 F1-R2 failed to generate a signal from the patient DNA. intron 5 breakpoint was between 6.3 to 9.3kb upstream of exon 5. the size of the deletion is estimated relative to the reference sequence NG_012232.1. the patient described in the current study has the largest genomic deletion, 10.8 kb and the breakpoint downstream of exon 5 is located between the breakpoints in previously reported individuals. the full-length amplicon is 1157 bp, the amplicon derived by RT-PCR of patient RNA, missing exon 5, is 1064 bp. the induced amplicons missing exon 6 (normal) are 984 bp and 891 (patient) the RT-PCR generating the amplicons from the 100 nM transfection of patient cells was not efficient. limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) genes found no sequence variants for CAPN3; the autosomal recessive LGMD genes, FKRP, DYSF, TCAP, TRIM32, TTN, SGCA, SGCA, TRIM32, TRIM32, TRIM32, TTN, SGCA, SGCA, SGCE and SGCG. the patient phenotype was considered to be more consistent with muscle section shows muscle fibres of very regular size and shape. staining intensity for alpha-sarcoglycan, merosin, alpha-dystroglycan, collagen VI, dysferlin, caveolin, lamin A/C and emerin appeared normal. Fig 1. Dystrophin immunofluorescence using novocastra Laboratories antibodies. intron 4 breakpoint was between 6.3 to 9.3kb upstream of exon 5. intron 5 breakpoint was more than 3.7 kb downstream of that exon. amplicon was used as a DNA sequencing template with primers. the size of the deletion is estimated, relative to the reference sequence NG_012232.1. the patient described in the current study has the largest genomic deletion, 10.8 kb. the breakpoint downstream of exon 5 is located between the breakpoints in previously reported individuals, with 3.4 and 7.78 kb deletions. an AO (2\u2019-O-methyl modified bases on a phosphorothioate backbone) was identified in a panel of overlapping oligomers as efficiently skipping this exon after in vitro transfection in primary mouse myogenic cells. this sequence was synthesized as a PMO conjugated to a cell penetrating peptide for in vivo studies in wild type mice. a dystrophic phenotype, induced by skipping of Dmd diaphragm of 5-PPMOk and sham treated mice is very low. dMHC staining and central nucleation is apparent in 5-PPMOk and mdx mice. fibrosis is consistent with a moderate dystrophic muscle phenotype. dystrophin was detected using NCL-Dys2 and Western Breeze. RT-PCR across Dmd exons 1\u20137 on RNA extracted from diaphragm of 5-PPMOk (n = 5) and sham treated C57BL10 mice. sham treated mdx mice showed efficient skipping of exon 5. nonsense mutations in some of the in-frame exons encoding the dystrophin rod domain manifest with a milder than expected phenotype due to natural skipping of the mutated and splice compromised exon. single exon deletions in the DMD N-terminal region are relatively uncommon, with 8 entries in the leiden database describing deletion of only exon 5. a 2.1 kb block of sequence, immediately upstream of exon 6 and common to both DMD exon 5 deletion patients, influences splice site selection and the novel fusion introns favour exon 6 skipping. it is possible that novel sequence at the 10.8 kb deletion breakpoint may have strengthened exon 6 recognition compared to other DMD exon 5 deletions. dystrophin is undetectable apart from occasional revertant fibres. exclusion of this exon removes the entire second actin binding sequence. it appears to compromise function of the dystrophin isoform, leading to a more severe muscle phenotype. two brothers with a deletion of DMD exon 3 showed early onset dystrophy. but stabilised in early adulthood and did not have respiratory or cardiac insufficiency. one can only speculate if the autism was related to the dystrophin isoform in this one family."}
