{"summary": "a rough yet useful indicator of the field is the number of bioinformatics and computational biology publications from China indexed in PubMed at NCBI. if we plot the percentage of bioinformatics publications from China, we observe that the contribution of bioinformatics research is becoming more significant within the life sciences in China. the number of bioinformatics publications from china is growing faster than the number of bioinformatics publications worldwide. the number of bioinformatics and computational biology publications in all of PubMed, retrieved from NCBI by the Entrez query \u201cChina[affiliation]\u201d.. the percentage of bioinformatics publications among all publications, in PubMed.

Jun Yu is a professor in the Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). he obtained a B.S. degree in biochemistry from Jilin University in 1983 and a PhD in biomedical sciences from New York University School of Medicine in 1990. he joined the University of Washington Genome Center in 1993. physicist runsheng Chen started his bioinformatics research at the end of the 1980s working on protein structure prediction. his group identified hundreds of novel small noncoding RNAs in the nematode C. elegans and characterized their sequence features and expression patterns. the Internet boom and the genomic boom in the 1990s proved critical to the expansion of bioinformatics in China. despite the late start, China caught up quickly with the worldwide Internet boom and established fast and broad Internet connections which were critical for biological data exchange. data is a major driving force for bioinformatics\u2014it demands new methods for data storage and analyses and motivated the computational discovery of biological patterns. bioinformatics teams played significant roles in data analysis. many new primary databases with raw data and value-added secondary databases were created by Chinese scientists. many locally developed methods were implemented and integrated into Web servers (Table 2). These databases address a broad range of biological questions and are open to the entire international scientific community. NATsDB A database of natural antisense transcripts identified in ten genomes http://natsdb.cbi.pku.edu.cn/ [151] NONCODE An integrated knowledge database of noncoding RNAs http://noncode.bioinfo.org.cn [13],[152] NPInter A collection of publicly available alternative translational initiation events http://bioinfo.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/atie SPIDer Saccharomyces protein\u2013protein interaction database http://cmb.bnu.edu.cn/SPIDer/index.html [130] InterDom A database of putative interacting protein domains for validating predicted protein interactions and complexes. phylogenies based on overlapping genes http://cmb.bnu.edu.cn/BPhyOG/ [165] SAPRED Using new structural and sequence attributes and Support Vector Machine to predict possible disease association of single amino acid polymorphism http://sapred.cbi.pku.edu.cn/ [82] Expression regulation analysis tools GBA EST-based digital gene expression profiling http://gba.cbi.pku.edu edu.cn/siRNA/index.htm [167] Protein analysis tools EasyGO Gene Ontology-based annotation and functional enrichment analysis tool for agronomical species. edu.cn/easygo/ [168] CTKPred An SVM-based method for the prediction and classification of the cytokine superfamily. Molecular Epidemiology Consortium sequenced and analysed SARS coronavirus genomic sequences from early, middle, and late phases of the epidemic. their work uncovered the molecular evolution of the SARS coronavirus and the viral invasion from animal to human [60],[61]. another group proposed a mathematical model to estimate the evolution rate of the SARS coronavirus genome (0.16 base/day) and the time of the last common ancestor of the sequenced SARS strains (August a number of interesting works studied the migration history of Chinese and East Asian populations by the sequencing and phylogentic analysis of Y-chromosomes. new algorithms continued to be developed, for example a Java-based method to analyze linkage disequilibrium [79], software for haplotype block partition and htSNPs selection [80], and an SVM-based method that used new sequence and structure features to predict the possible disease association. a group studied the origination of new genes in rice and found a surprisingly high number of retrogenes as well as chimeric genes originated by retroposition. another group designed a theoretical model based on the molecular clock to test the hypotheses of hybridization as an evolutionary mechanism [89]. new method could identify alternatively spliced isoforms from EST data ten times faster than other existing methods. an interesting work identified 2,695 newly evolved exons in rodents and calculated the new exon origination rate at 2.71103 per gene per million years. the expression of intron-encoded noncoding RNAs was profiled using a custom-designed microarray combining noncoding RNAs and their host genes. many noncoding RNAs were found to be independently transcribed with ncRNA-specific promoter elements. new databases were created to catalogue noncoding RNAs and noncoding RNA\u2013protein interactions. new algorithms were developed with increased accuracy [15], [16], [123]\u2013[126]. a variety of classification methods had been developed in china. another method predicted protein submitochondria locations by hybridizing pseudo-amino acid composition with segmented sequence features [24] key proteins, subgraphs, and modules were identified and analyzed in signal transduction networks [136], transcriptional regulation networks in yeast [137], and protein\u2013protein interaction networks during fruitfly and human brain aging [139]. a small group of researchers in china have made progress in computational neurobiology, including proposing a computational model as a neurodecoder. a growing significant talent pool is the new generation of young bioinformatics scientists trained in local bioinformatics degree programs. many other Chinese universities are now offering bioinformatics degree programs at the PhD, Master's, and even Bachelor's levels. many university courses and ad hoc workshops have been offered to train bench biologists on how to use bioinformatic databases.
