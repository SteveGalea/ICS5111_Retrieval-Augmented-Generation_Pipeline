{"summary": "we estimated the disease burden and impact of birth-related, maternal, household, and seasonal factors on HCoV infections among children from birth to 6 months old in rural Nepal. HCoV ARI incidence was more than twice as high among nonneonates than among neonates. 3693 pregnant women were enrolled in their second or third trimester. a midnasal sample was collected if an infant had any of the following criteria defining an ARI episode: fever, cough, difficult or rapid breathing, wheeze, or a draining ear. date of LMP was obtained by visiting women of childbearing age every 5 weeks. weight was considered to be a birth weight if taken within 72 hours of birth. low birthweight (LBW) was defined as 2500 g. a total of 3693 pregnant women were enrolled in the study from April 2011 to April 2013. a total of 4223 ARI episodes were detected in these infants. HCoV was detected in 296 swabs from 282 (8%) infants. HCoV incidence among infants was 255.6 (95% confidence interval [CI], 227.3\u2013286.5) per 1000 PY. HCoV-NL63 circulated every year of the study period and peaked around the autumn months. HCoV-OC43 circulated every year of the study period and peaked around the autumn months. poorer households were seen to be at increased risk compared to wealthier households. being born in the monsoon season or infected between June and august lowered the risk of HCoV compared to other times of the year. bocavirus shows a negative association between HCoV and other respiratory viruses. 31 of the 282 (11%) infants with HCoV ARIs received medical care. no deaths were reported among the HCoV cases. 6; 3467.7 (3352.1\u20133586.3) 1200 (86.4%) Sex Male 164 (55.4%); 605.9; 270.7 (230.8\u2013315.4) 2237 (57.0%); 605.4; 3694.8 (3543.3\u20133851.2) 694 (50.0%) Female 132 (44.6%); 552.8; 552.8; 238.8 (199.8\u2013283.2) 1690 (43.0%); 552.5; 3059.1 (2915.0\u20133208.5 maternal smoking Nonsmoker 286 (96.6%); 1121.1; 255.1 (226.4\u2013286.4) 3762 (95.8%); 1120.4; 3357.8 (3251.4\u20133466.9) 1356 (97.8%) Smoker 9 (3.0%); 35.8; 251.0 (114.8\u2013476.6) 152 (3.9%); 35.8; 4242.8 (3595.2\u20134973.5) 32 (2.3%) Maternal literacy Literate Literate 331 (23.8%) 50th quartile 86 (29.1%); 357.4; 240.6 (192.5\u2013297.2) 1263 (32.2%); 357.1; 3536.4 (3344.0\u20133736.9) 419 (30.2%) 75th quartile 65 (22.0%); 311.6; 208.6 (161.0\u2013265.9) 915 (23.3%); 311.4; 2938.4 (2751.1\u20133135.1) 402 (28.9%) >75th ARI, acute respiratory infection; CI, confidence interval; HCoV, human coronavirus; LBW, low birth weight; PY, person-years. aPY at risk.

HCoV incidence ranged from 77.1 per 1000 PY in Costa Rica to 17.6 per 1000 PY in Singapore among children enrolled in an influenza vaccine efficacy trial. HCoV-OC43 circulated around spring-winter of 1 study year, similar to the pattern reported in western Europe/United States. HCoV-OC43 circulated around spring-winter of 1 study year, similar to the pattern reported in western Europe/United States. 137 (46%) were coinfections with at least 1 other respiratory virus detected in the swab. the negative association between the viruses could be explained by the induction of interferons and other cytokines following infection by 1 virus, which could then prevent infection by the subsequent virus. despite active surveillance, our study has several limitations. 4% and 28% of nasal specimens positive for coronavirus in the absence of symptoms. provided by the authors to benefit the reader, the posted materials are not copyedited and are the sole responsibility of the authors."}
