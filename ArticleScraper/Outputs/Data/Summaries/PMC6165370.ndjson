{"summary": "porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an enveloped virus that belongs to the genus Alphacoronavirus of the family Coronaviridae with single-stranded positive-sense RNA. it is clinically manifested by severe watery diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration in the suckling piglets. AMPs are important components of the nonspecific immune system of animals to eradicate invaders. nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) of Caerin1.1 in membrane mimetic environments showed that it has two -helices and a flexible hinge region composed of two prolines. both prolines are essential for the antimicrobial activities [19]. some studies have reported that Caerin1.1 exhibits antibacterial and antiviral properties by forming pores on the membrane. YN strain CH/YNKM-8/2013 was isolated from a suckling piglet suffering from acute diarrhea. the cells infected with PEDV strains were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10 g/mL trypsin. both were chemically synthesized by Bioyeargene (Wuhan, China) immunofluorescence assays (IFA) Vero cells cultured in 24-well plates were washed with PBS for 3 times and inoculated respectively with single medium, or single PEDV, or PEDV. cells were rinsed three times with PBS at 20 h post infection (hpi) and treated with 120 L/well lysis solution containing protease inhibitors (PMSF) membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies. membranes were visualized using the ClarityTM Western ECL Blotting Substrate (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) infectivity was calculated by TCID50 (Tissue Culture Infectious Dose 50) at 1 hpi, the cells were washed twice with PBS and then treated with different concentrations of Caerin1.1. at 12 hpi, the culture supernatants and the cells were collected respectively. the cells were pre-chilled at 4 \u00b0C for 1 h before infection. the cells were washed with ice cold PBS 3 times, replenished with trypsin. the inhibitory effects were determined by TCID50. the cells were washed 3 times with PBS at each step. statistical analyses were performed using student\u2019s t-test. Graph Pad Prism5.0 was used to analyze the statistics in this study. in 96-well culture plates was assessed by MTT (3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, 5 mg/mL) assay. the cells were incubated with Caerin1.1 at different concentrations for 72 h. then 20 L/well MTT was added and cultured for additional 4 h. Western Blot Analysis Vero cells were cultured in 6-well plates and infected with PEDV. cells were rinsed three times with PBS at 20 h post infection. then 30 L of sodium dodecyl sulfate loading buffer was added to the cells extracts and the samples were boiled for 10min. the supernatants were ultracentrifuged at 4 \u00b0C for 2 h at 200,500 g. then the purified virus pellets were re-suspended with PBS and treated with Caerin1.1 (10 g/mL) for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C and the viruses treated in the same manner were used as positive control. both the extracellular and intracellular virus yields were determined by TCID50. the vero cells in 12-well plates were inoculated with PEDV in the presence or in the absence of Caerin1.1 at different time points. the infectivity was calculated by TCID50 (Tissue Culture Infectious Dose 50) at 1 hpi, the cells were washed twice with PBS and then treated with different concentrations of Caerin1.1. at 12 hpi, the culture supernatants and the cells were collected respectively. FITC-Caerin1.1 (100 g/mL), PEDV (200 pfu), and both FITC-caerin1.1 (100 g/mL) and PEDV (200 pfu) cells were seeded onto glass coverslips and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 12 h. the cells were washed 3 times with PBS at each step. Graph Pad Prism5.0 was used to analyze the statistics in this study. the statistical significances were defined as p 0.05 (*) and p 0.001 (***) low temperature and inadequate incubation time would obviously affect the inhibition activity of Caerin1.1 against PEDV. the most suitable incubating conditions of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and Caerin1.1 were detected. the titer of PEDV was detected under the treatment of different concentration of Caerin1.1 (2.5, 5, 10, 20 g/mL) after one hour. the control groups (PEDV) were not treated by Caerin1.1. Caerin1.1 significantly inhibited the multiplication of PEDV in a dose-dependent manner. titer and fluorescence intensity decreased significantly with the increase in the concentration of Caerin1.1. compared with the virus control, treatment group showed excellent inhibitory effects in a dose dependent manner even at extremely low concentrations of Caerin1.1. extracellular virus titers were determined separately by using TCID50. the progeny virus titer decreased significantly as compared to that of virus control. extracellular virus titers were also determined at different time points and different Caerin1.1 concentrations. FITC-Caerin1.1 (100 g/mL), PEDV (200 pfu) and PEDV (200 pfu) separately. the infection was detected with the monoclonal antibody against PEDV S protein (red) and cell nuclei were counterstained with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (blue) PEDV incubated with Caerin1.1 (10 g/mL) for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. arrows indicate complete (b) or destructed PEDV particles (a) the western blot assay did not exhibit any obvious differences in protein expression among attachment period treated group, entry period treated group, and the PEDV control group. the result of cytotoxicity assay indicated that cell viability increased with the decrease of the concentration of Caerin1.1. the viability of cells remained over 80% when treated with Caerin1.1 at the concentrations not exceeding 110 g/mL. the control groups (PEDV) of A and B were treated without any Caerin1.1 at 37 \u00b0C. the results are presented as the mean SD of three independent experiments. the results are presented as the mean SD of three independent experiments. the number of plaques (clear spots) observed represents the number of viruses in a given dilution (a) Mock-infected cells; Cells infected with PEDV titer of 2000 pfu (b) and 200 pfu (c); (d) cells treated with 10 g/mL Caerin1.1. the control groups (PEDV) were not treated by Caerin1.1. titer and fluorescence intensity of PEDV decreased significantly with the increase in the concentration of Caerin1.1. the inhibitory effects of Caerin1.1 against another two PEDV strains were examined to evaluate the anti-PEDV potential of Caerin1.1 based on IFA. extracellular virus titers were detected after treatment with different concentrations of Caerin1.1. the concentration of the progeny virus titers was 2.5, 5, 10, 20 g/mL. the results of three independent experiments are presented as the mean SD. PEDV infection was detected with the monoclonal antibody against PEDV S protein (red) and cell nuclei were counterstained with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (blue) Caerin1.1 could destroy the structure of the virus to block the infection of the host cells. PEDV without Caerin1.1 treatment acts as the control group. TCID50 showed that Caerin1.1 had no obvious inhibitory effects. the aim of this study is to find whether Caerin1.1 has the antiviral activity against the three PEDV strains. some -helical peptides such as Melittin and Cecropin exert antiviral activities by direct disruption of virus membranes. this is the first attempt to reveal that Caerin1.1 has strong antiviral activity against PEDV infection. the results showed that Caerin1.1 did not have obvious antiviral effect during viral replication period. but it can control the infection progress by blocking the release of PEDV particles to reduce viral transmission among the adjacent cells. the mechanisms still remain to be further investigated. our study testifies the outstanding antiviral activities of Caerin1.1. lays a foundation for future research and for the application of amphibian antimicrobial peptides."}
