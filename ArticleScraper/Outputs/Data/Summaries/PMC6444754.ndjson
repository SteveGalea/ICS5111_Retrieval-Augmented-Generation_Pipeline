{"summary": "Western Australian children (17 years) hospitalized with radiologically-confirmed community-acquired pneumonia were recruited. clinical characteristics and biomarker levels were compared between cases with definite bacterial pneumonia. combination of elevated CRP with the presence of fever (38C) or absence of rhinorrhea improved the discrimination. further studies are required to explore combination of biomarkers and symptoms for use as definitive diagnostic tool. different diagnostic values such as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for different cut-off values of CRP level to distinguish definite bacterial pneumonia from presumed viral and other pneumonias. curve for blood ANC to distinct between definite bacterial pneumonia and presumed viral pneumonia. the area-under curve has been inserted in the figure."}
