{"summary": "wearable sensors capture detailed location and interaction data for 3 different categories of HCWs in the university of Iowa's medical Intensive Care Unit. each mote is programmed to broadcast a brief message at regular intervals (5 or 6 times a minute) the motes communicate over unused space in the Wi-Fi spectrum, do not interfere with medical devices, and are easy to deploy. every morning at 7 am we distributed badges to each HCW. badges were reset and recharged for use the next day. badges were assigned a unique identification number associated with 1 of 3 categories. we based our infection and handwashing model closely on that used by Temime et al to simulate the spread of organisms by direct contact. we used 2 disease-based parameters: duration (D) and transmissibility (P) duration was set at 10 days. ization before treatment 10 days Hand hygiene efficacy 0.58 (soap), 0.83 (rub) Hand hygiene baseline compliance = 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 = 0.10 Environmental contamination transmission rate 0.00\u20130.01 Agent-Based Simulations. each simulation uses contact data from 1 of 4 different representative MICU work shifts (2 day shifts, 7 am\u20137 pm, and 2 night shifts, 7 pm\u20137 am) noncompliant HCWs are assigned i = 0.10. the simulation then replays the selected shift's events 30 times. if the event is a contact between 1 infected and 1 uninfected individual, the infection is passed on. each mote is programmed to broadcast a brief message at regular intervals (5 or 6 times a minute) each mote is programmed to broadcast a brief message at regular intervals (5 or 6 times a minute) the motes communicate over unused space in the Wi-Fi spectrum. badge identification number associated with 1 of 3 HCW categories was assigned at random within categories. no patient-specific identifiers or clinical data were collected for this process improvement project. data from individual badges were merged to produce a chronological log of all messages received by any badge over the course of each shift. ime et al used 2 disease-based parameters: duration (D) and transmissibility (P) duration was set at 10 days, which Temime et al suggest might reflect a weekly bacterial screening plus a 3-day wait for test results. we assumed HCW\u2013HCW, HCW\u2013patient, and patient\u2013HCW transmissions are all equally probable. each simulation uses contact data from 1 of 4 different representative MICU work shifts. the 2 day shifts track 27 or 19 HCWs and 19 or 18 patient beds. the 2 night shifts track 19 or 14 HCWs and 18 or 19 patient beds. peripatetic, or most connected, (deidentified) HCWs and the least connected (deidentified) HCWs based on the number of unique patients visited during that shift. each simulation compares results for 7 distinct scenarios demonstrating the impact of peripatetic HCWs on infection rates. a small number of HCWs were responsible for a disproportionate share of the contacts. this property is clearly visible in the cumulative distribution functions for the duration of these contacts. healthcare workers whose individual contacts fall into the tail are peripatetic HCWs. each plot shows mean and median values obtained for each scenario over 1000 replicates as a function of transmissibility, P, for selected daytime and nighttime contact patterns. each plot shows the aggregate outcomes obtained over 1000 replicates of 360 hours of synthetic medical intensive care unit contact hours. the simulations correspond to a medium level baseline compliance ( = 0.50) with alcohol-based rub ( = 0.83) and no environmental contamination ( = 0). when either 1 or 2 noncompliant HCWs are present, the best results are obtained when the least peripatetic HCW(s) is/are noncompliant (i = 0); randomly selected noncompliant HCWs generally produce infection count results in between. the results are consistent with those observed in Figure 2 for alcohol-based rub. all 7 standard scenarios assorting as expected. the mean (A and B) and median (C and D) plots are much less differentiated. less effective hand hygiene, represented here by the use of soap and water ( = 0.58; see Figure 3) does increase the expected infection count. a similar effect is noticeable in the lower panels, where some of the median curves in Figure 3 are shifted slightly to the left and up with respect to the analogous curves in Figure 2. in a typical daytime shift, the average number of contacts per HCW over a 12-hour period was 80.1 (median, 64; k = 0.48), and for a typical nighttime shift, the average was 76.1 (median, 22; k = \u20131.34) but these contact distributions vary significantly by individual shift (eg, day vs night) and contact type (eg, HCW\u2013HCW vs HCW\u2013patient) the larger horizontal separation of the healthcare worker\u2013HCW curve and HCW\u2013patient curve in (A and B) reflects the difference between day shifts, where HCW\u2013patient interactions are relatively more balanced, and night shifts, where the smaller number of HCWs on duty are more likely to interact with each other than with most patients. each plot shows the aggregate outcomes for day-shift (A and C) and night-shift (B and D) simulations as a function of transmissibility. each plot shows the aggregate outcomes obtained over 1000 replicates of 360 hours of synthetic medical intensive care unit contact hours. infection counts for day-shift (A and C) and night-shift (B and D) simulations as a function of transmissibility for all 7 standard scenarios. the results are consistent with those observed in Figure 2 for alcohol-based rub. average and median number of patients infected over 1000 replicates is skewed. median values can be unduly influenced by just a few replicates where infection affects a large number of agents. the curves for scenarios S6 and S7 are always well above the other curves in the upper plots of both Figures 2 and 4. however, the lower plots of Figure 4 do indicate that environmental contamination increases the likelihood that an infection will spread beyond the initial patient. new technology, embodied by motes and similar wearable devices, can be used to accurately measure contact patterns in healthcare settings. ignoring the inherent complexity of contact patterns in real-world healthcare settings can lead to misleading simulation results. the existence of peripatetic HCWs should also change the way we collect information about hand hygiene and other HCW behavior. the use of hand hygiene product has been proposed as a surrogate marker for hand hygiene compliance [18], yet product usage is an aggregate measure that is blind to the existence of peripatetic. traditional approaches to contact tracing are labor intensive and often prone to measurement errors. our sensor motes could also be used to estimate more accurate disease parameters. this wireless approach does not require any preexisting infrastructure."}
