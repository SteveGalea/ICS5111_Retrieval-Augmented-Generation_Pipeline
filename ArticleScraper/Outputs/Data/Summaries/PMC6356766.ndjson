{"summary": "MERS-CoV is the second highly pathogenic coronavirus to emerge after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) it causes severe acute respiratory failure and extra-pulmonary multi-organ damage accompanied by severe systemic inflammation. the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV still needs to be explored. the complement system is an ancient molecular cascade. homologs have been found in sea urchin and mosquitoes. animal studies were carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations set out in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. THP-1 differentiated macrophages cultured in 75-cm2 flasks were infected with MERS-CoV at a multiplicity of infection. mice received an intravenous injection (i.v.) of a monoclonal Ab (mAb) specific for mouse C5aR1 to block the interaction of C5a to C5aR1 or an injection of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at the same time as MERS-CoV inoculation. the relative amount of each gene was obtained by normalization against an endogenous control gene (GAPDH) an identical amplification reaction comprising (i) polymerase activation and DNA denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 10 min, (ii) 40 cycles each of the denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 10 min, and (iii) an annealing/extension step at 60 \u00b0C for 30 s, was used for each gene analyzed. Western Blot Analysis Proteins isolated from THP-1 monocytic cells and THP-1 differentiated macrophages were electrophoresed in a 12% SDS-PAGE gel. PVDF membranes were then blocked for 1 h at room temperature in 5% non-fat milk. primary antibodies used were mouse anti-caspase 1 (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Cat: sc-392736, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), mouse anti-IL-1 (1:200; sections of paraffin-embedded spleen and lung tissues (4 m thick) were prepared and stained to detect antigen expression. retrieved sections were incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C. THP-1 differentiated macrophages cultured in 75-cm2 flasks were infected with MERS-CoV at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1. the virus was adsorbed at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h and unbound virus was washed away. mice in the sham group received the same volume of DMEM. all infectious experiments related to MERS-CoV were performed in an approved biosafety level 3 facility. Isolation of RNA and Proteins THP-1 differentiated macrophages were lysed in TRIzolTM Reagent at 24 h post-infection with MERS-CoV. total RNA was extracted and purified using an RNeasy Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) an identical amplification reaction comprising (i) polymerase activation and DNA denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 10 min, (ii) 40 cycles each of the denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 10 min, and (iii) an annealing/extension step at 60 \u00b0C for 30 s, was used for each gene analyzed. membranes were then blocked for 1 h at room temperature in 5% non-fat milk. primary antibodies used for analysis were mouse anti-caspase 1 (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Cat: sc-392736, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), mouse anti-IL-1 (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Cat: sc-32294; rabbit anti-cleaved IL-1 (1:2000; Cell Signaling, Cat: #83186, Danvers, MA, USA retrieved sections were incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C with antibodies. mouse anti-caspase-1 mAb (AdipoGen, San Diego, CA, USA), polyclonal rabbit anti-CD68 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), and polyclonal anti-IFN-R (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) immunoglobulin G was then added, followed by an avidin\u2013biotin\u2013peroxidase conjugate (Beijing Zhongshan MERS-CoV infection induces pyroptosis in THP-1 macrophages. expression of pro-caspase-1, pro-IL-1, and pro-IL-1 increased by 170-fold. expression of pro-IL-1 increased by 170-fold, whereas in macrophages increased by 26-fold. mRNA encoding NLRP3, pro-caspase-1, and pro-IL-1 in lung tissue from hDPP4 transgenic mice at day 3 post-MERS-CoV infection. expression of pro-IL-1 mRNA was significantly higher after MERS-CoV infection. serum from mice in the MERS-CoV-infected group contained more TNF-, IFN-, and IL-6 than that from sham-infected mice. serum from mice in the MERS-CoV-infected group contained more TNF-, IFN-, and IL-6 than that from sham-infected mice. MERS-CoV infection alters complement expression in monocytes and macrophages. complement system links activation of Toll-like receptors to transcription of IL-1 mRNA. mice receiving anti-C5aR1 Ab expressed less caspase-1 in the spleen at day 7 post-MERS-CoV infection. blocking the axis reduces pyroptosis in hDPP4-transgenic mice. inhibiting C5aR1 Reduces Inflammation in Mice Infected with MERS-CoV, we measured proinflammatory cytokines (IFN-, TNF-, and IL-6) in serum at day 7 post-MERS-CoV infection. infiltration of the lungs and spleen by macrophages and expression of IFN- receptor were assessed by immunohistochemical staining 7 days after challenge. MERS-CoV infection induces pyroptosis in THP-1 macrophages. total RNA was used for RT-qPCR to detect transcription of pro-caspase-1, pro-IL-1, and NLRP3. data are expressed as means SEM (n = 2 per group) samples of total protein were subject to Western blotting. expression of pro-IL-1 mRNA was significantly higher after MERS-CoV infection. results showed that MERS-CoV infection induced production of IL-1. no significant difference in expression of caspase-1 in the lung and spleen. serum from mice in the MERS-CoV-infected group contained more TNF-, IFN-, and IL-6 than that from sham-infected mice. IHC examination of CD68 and IFN- receptor expression also suggested greater macrophage infiltration and activation in the lung and spleen of mice at 7 days post-MERS-CoV infection. protease cathepsin L and C3a activate NLRP3 and triggers IL-1 production in human monocytes by regulating efflux of ATP [29,30,31]. RT-qPCR examined expression of complement components and their receptors C3aR, C5aR1 and C5aR2. mice receiving anti-C5aR1 Ab expressed less caspase-1 in the spleen at day 7 post-MERS-CoV infection. serum levels of IL-1 were lower in the anti-C5aR1 Ab-treated group than in the PBS-treated group at Day 1 and Day 3 [16] post-MERS-CoV infection. complement inhibition decreased expression of pyroptosis indicators, IL-1 and caspase-1, in mice infected with MERS IFN- levels in mice treated with anti-C5aR1 Ab were much lower than those in the PBS-treated group. IHC revealed that macrophage infiltration and activation were lower in the anti-C5aR1 Ab-treated group. pyroptosis or inflammasome activation plays an important role in virus-mediated pathogenesis. abortive HIV-1 infection in quiescent lymphoid CD4 T cells leads to CD4 T cell pyroptosis independent of the NLRP3 inflammasome. virus infection leads to pyroptosis by measuring activation of caspase-1 and IL-1 in human macrophages infected with MERS-CoV (Figure 1). Activated caspase-1 could be released into extracellular space and delivered to the lung via exosomes or the systemic circulation; it then cleaves pro-IL-1 into its bio-activated form. MERS-CoV infection induces pro-IL-1 transcription, and complement activation, which leads to pyroptosis in macrophages. induction of pyroptosis was related with complement activation and may be promoted by ligation of C5a and C5aR1."}
