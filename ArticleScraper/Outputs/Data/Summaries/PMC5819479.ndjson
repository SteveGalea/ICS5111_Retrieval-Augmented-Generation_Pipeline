{"summary": "our research group first published a catalogue of human-infective RNA viruses (and other infectious agents) in 20013. this catalogue and metadata have been used in a number of ways. first, to estimate the diversity of human-infective RNA viruses using two techniques, extrapolation of the virus discovery curve4 and an ecological diversity measure6. the database lists 214 ICTV-recognised, human-infective RNA virus species. this is a substantial increase on previously published counts6, reflecting the rapid rate of discovery and recognition of RNA viruses in recent years. transmission may be via a natural route, including by arthropod vectors, or as unintentional iatrogenic transmission. level 2 indicates human infective but not transmissible (between humans) level 3 indicates transmissible from one human to another (by any natural route including arthropod vectors), but so far restricted to self-limiting outbreaks. Level 4 viruses are divided into 4a and 4b. 91 (43%) of species can be transmitted by vectors (invariably a fly or tick) transmission route No. species Vector-borne 91 Inhalation 67 Ingestion 33 Fomites 19 Sexual 10 Broken skin 25 Iatrogenic 9 Maternal 28 Close physical contact 68 We hope this database will be of value to researchers undertaking comparative studies of human-infective RNA viruses. identification of human-infective species Viruses eligible for inclusion in our catalogue only if they were classified as species by the ICTV as of July 21st 2017. the main ICTV criteria for defining RNA virus species are: relatedness based on sequence data; serological cross-reactivity; host range; and transmission route. there is huge variation in the epidemiology of subtypes of influenza viruses such as H1N1 and H3N2. ii) peer-reviewed primary report providing robust evidence of human infection. only evidence of infections with the specific virus species, or strains/variants falling under that species were accepted. both natural infections and unintentional iatrogenic or otherwise artificially-acquired infections were considered as evidence supporting human infection. transmission route literature reviews for transmission route data were conducted within Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Scopus. structured search key words were: (virus name and all synonyms listed by ICTV separated by \u2018or\u2019) and (host or range or reservoir or animal or mammal or bird or avian) data on host range is supported by peer-reviewed primary publications where available. our list of human-infective RNA viruses results from systematic literature reviews carried out over the past 18 years. literature reviews covered multiple reference databases (Web of Science, Google Scholar, PubMed and Scopus), supplemented by secondary sources. pathogenicity was not considered a criterion for human infectivity. however, we have indicated where a virus is known only from serological evidence. there are 36 viruses of this kind, of which 28 have not been reported in humans for the past 10 years. transmission route literature reviews for transmission route data were conducted within Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Scopus. structured search key words were: (virus name and all synonyms listed by ICTV separated by \u2018or\u2019) and (transm* or *borne or vector) information on transmission routes is similarly supported by peer-reviewed primary publications where available. transmission level as 2 (human infective but not transmissible between humans); 3 (=transmissible from one human to another by any natural route including arthropod vectors; but restricted to self-limiting outbreaks); 4a (=endemic in human populations or have the potential to cause major epidemics, and are only known to infect humans (ignoring arthropod vectors) over 90% of discovery dates are supported by PubMed linked reference. the database is licenced as Creative Commons Attribution 4.0."}
