{"summary": "retrospective observational study was conducted at a university hospital from January 2009 to March 2013. study subjects included adults (aged 18 years) with pneumococcal pneumonia who had undergone laboratory tests for RVI. CAP is the leading cause of death due to infectious diseases worldwide. mortality from pneumococcal pneumonia still ranges from 11% to 20%. despite advances in medical care, mortality from pneumococcal pneumonia still ranges from 11% to 20%. retrospective case\u2013control study was performed at a 950-bed tertiary care hospital in Seoul, the Republic of Korea, from January 2009 to March 2013. subjects included adult patients (age 18 years) with pneumococcal pneumonia who had been tested for RVI using multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) within 30 days preceding S. pneumoniae isolation. only a single episode per patient was included in this study during all winter seasons. patients who did not undergo laboratory tests for RVI within 30 days preceding pneumococcal pneumonia were excluded. all patients were treated with antibiotics according to local practice guidelines. gene, Inc., Seoul, Korea based on a multiplex RT-PCR method. the nucleic acid amplification was conducted using the Seeplex RV master mix. Demographic and clinical characteristics were compared between patients with severe and non-severe pneumococcal pneumonia. pneumococcal pneumonia was defined as an acute lower respiratory tract infection with opacity or infiltrates on a chest radiograph as confirmed by radiologists plus isolation of S. pneumoniae from sputum samples. patients who did not undergo laboratory tests for RVI within 30 days preceding pneumococcal pneumonia were excluded. patients who had preceding or concurrent flu-like or cold symptoms underwent nasopharyngeal swab sampling to isolate the respiratory viruses. clinical isolates of S. pneumoniae were identified by conventional biochemical methods and the VITEK 2 GP card. continuous variables were expressed as mean standard deviation or median interquartile range (IQR) a two-sample Student's t-test was used to compare continuous independent variables with a non-normal distribution. multivariate logistic regression analyses using a backward stepwise variable selection based on logistic regression statistics. the median (IQR) of the CURB-65 and PSI scores in the 191 patients with pneumococcal pneumonia were 2 (1\u20134) and 92 (74\u2013117), respectively. ninety-nine (518%) patients had severe pneumococcal pneumonia (PSI score 91) mixed viruses represent co-infection of two viruses: Respiratory syncytial virus A plus influenza A virus (n = 1), metapneumovirus plus influenza B (n = 1), and rhinovirus plus coronavirus 229E/NL63 (n = 1). Hypoalbuminemia, azotemia, and thrombocytopenia were more common in the case group (severe pneumococcal pneumonia) than in the control group (non-severe pneum cardiovascular 33 (173) 17 (172) 16 (174) 0968 Central nervous system 37 (194) 24 (242) 13 (141) 0077 Malignancy 34 (178) 25 (253) 9 (98) 0005 Diabetes mellitus 44 (230) 32 (323) 12 (130) 0002 Renal 7 (37) 3 (30) 4 (43) 0713 Hepatic 6 (31) 3 (30) 3 (33) 1000 Respiratory 36 (188) 19 (192) 17 (185) 0900 Hematological 9 (47) 7 (7 the case group had more multilobar consolidation on the chest radiographs than the control group. the case group had more multilobar consolidation on the chest radiographs than the control group. there was no significant difference in the complicated pleural effusion between the case and control groups. the resistance rates of the pneumococcal isolates to penicillin and levofloxacin were significantly higher in the case group than in the control group. the resistance rates of the pneumococcal isolates to penicillin and levofloxacin were significantly higher in the case group. patients with severe pneumococcal pneumonia showed higher pneumonia-related mortality and longer hospital stays. median length of hospital stay for inpatients was 8 days (IQR, 4\u201318) preceding RVI (odds ratio [OR], 249;
