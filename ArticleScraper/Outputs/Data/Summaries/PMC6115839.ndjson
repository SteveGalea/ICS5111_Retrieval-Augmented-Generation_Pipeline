{"summary": "interferon inducible transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) have been shown to be essential restriction factors against a broad spectrum of enveloped viruses. recently, we and others discovered that IFITMs block HIV-1 entry into target cells. this includes negative imprinting, in which IFITMs are incorporated into virions and impaired HIV-1 envelope (Env) processing. dual tropic 89.6, as well as twenty HIV-1 B-clade Env reference clones and twelve global T/F viruses. we knocked down IFITMs in human PBMCs and purified CD4+ T cells. we determined the contribution of IFITMs in IFN-mediated inhibition of multiple and single round of HIV-1 infection. antibodies against IFITM1 (Cat# 11727-3-AP), IFITM2 (Cat# 12769-1-AP) and IFITM3 (11714-1-AP) were purchased from Proteintech Group. anti-FLAG M2 antibody was purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA) intron gaussia luciferase reporter viral stocks were made by transfecting pHIV-inGLuc, HIV-1 Gag-pol 8.2 and HIV Env at ratio of 1:1:0.5 into HEK293T cells. twenty-four hours after transfection, supernatants were collected and filtered through 0.22 m filter and stored at 80 \u00b0C until use. reporter viruses were applied to each well and spinoculated for 1 h. cells were washed once and fed with fresh medium. 48 h after transduction, cells were collected and analyzed by flow cytometer. for primary CD4+ T cells, cells were first transduced with shRNA control. immunoblotting Western blotting was performed as previously described. cells were lysed in pre-chilled RIPA buffer for 20 min. protein samples were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. the purity of CD4+ T lymphocytes was above 90% after autoMACS separation as validated by CD4 staining using flow cytometry. antibodies against IFITM1 (Cat# 11727-3-AP), IFITM2 (Cat# 12769-1-AP) and IFITM3 (11714-1-AP) were purchased from Proteintech Group (Chicago, IL, USA) intron gaussia luciferase reporter viruses were produced by co-transfection of pLenti-puro-GFP, HIV-1 gag-pol 8.2 and HIV-1 Env plasmids at ratio of 1:1:0.5 into HEK293T cells. twenty-four hours after transfection, supernatants were collected and filtered through 0.22 m filter and stored at 80 \u00b0C until use. g/mL puromycin or 250 g/mL hygromycin was applied for selection up to 2 weeks until the negative control cells were completely dead. reporter viruses were applied to each well and spinoculated for 1 h at 1680 g, 4 \u00b0C. cells were washed twice and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. results were analyzed using the Flowjo software. IFITM1, 2, 3 expression levels in U87.CD4.CXCR4 and U87.CD4.CCR5 cell lines were examined by immunoblotting using an anti-FLAG antibody. pLenti-GFP assay was performed by infecting indicated cells with pLenti-GFP pseudotypes bearing Env of interest. all data are presented as mean SD of at least three independent experiments. we first produced GFP-expressing HIV-1 pseudovirions bearing the individual Env of HIV-1 by co-transfecting HEK293T cells with pLenti-Puro-GFP, Gag-Pol 8.2 and HIV-1 Env of interest. analyzed the pseudoviral infection efficiency in U87-derived cell lines by flow cytometry. intron-gaussia luciferase-based system for HIV (HIV-inGLuc) [13,14] re-examined the functional effects of IFITM proteins on CXCR4, CCR5 and dual tropic HIV-1 strains in U87 ells. the system is highly sensitive and quantitative compared to the classical colorimetric assays, including fluorescence imaging. infection by the dual tropic HIV-1 89.6 in both U87.CD4.CXCR4 and U87.CD4.CCR5 cells was almost equivalently inhibited by IFITM1 and IFITM3. however, IFITM3 still exhibited the strongest inhibition among all three IFITMs (Figure 1E) IFITM3 showed the strongest inhibition on entry of all T/F Env-mediated HIV-1 into U87.CD4/CCR5 cells. entry of T/F viruses is more sensitive to inhibition by IFITM2 and 3 than by IFITM1. 54622, pBRB958_06.TB1.4305 and pBRB931_06.TC3.4930 infected U87.CD4.CCR5 cells with an intermediate infection efficiency. the rest six T/F viruses showed a very low efficiency of infection. IFITM3 and IFITM2 were more potent than IFITM1 to inhibit entry mediated by NL4.3, AD8 and 89.6 Env. these cells were infected with virus bearing Env proteins of NL4.3, AD8 or 89.6 Env. this was consistent with previously published results. luciferase activities in parental Hut-78/CCR5 cells were plotted in Figure 3C. AD8 had the highest rate of infection, 4fold and 50-fold above HIV-1 NL4.3 and 89.6, respectively. the effect of FLAG-tagged and WT IFITMs on HIV-1 NL4.3 inGLuc infection in SupT1 cells determined by gaussia luciferase activities 48 h after infection. the levels of FLAG-tagged IFITMs corresponded to 300 U (for IFITM2/3) or 1000 U (for IFITM1) IFN2b-induced endogenous IFITMs in SupT1 cells. we then examined the effect of these FLAG-tagged IFITMs and WT IFITMs on infection of SupT1 cells by using HIV-1 NL4.3 inGLuc pseudotypes. ions expressing a mixed pool of human IFITM shRNAs (IFITM1, 2 and 3) were assessed and confirmed by western blotting shown in Figure 4A. knockdown of IFITMs in donor 1 and donor 2 modestly increased HIV-1 NL4.3 entry (50%), yet more potently elevated entry of AD8 (2\u20133-fold) luciferase activity was calculated by setting the values of shRNA control and IFN-untreated cells to 1.0. different comparisons were performed as indicated, with p values shown. we purified human CD4+ T cells from PBMCs of two additional donors. we used the same set of shRNAs to knock down IFITMs in purified CD4+ cells. cells were treated with IFN2b for 24 h before being infected with HIV-inGLuc or infectious NL4.3. Ectopic expression of IFITMs in U87 Cells Inhibits CXCR4 and CCR5 HIV-1 Entry with Equivalent Efficiency Neil and colleagues used U87.CD4.CXCR4 and U87.CD4.CCR5 cells overexpressing IFITM1, 2 and 3. to validate these results, we took the same approach and generated U87.CD4.CXCR4 and U87.CD4.CCR5 cell lines that stably expressed a comparable level of FLAG-tagged CXCR4 tropic viruses NL4.3 and HXB2 and dual tropic virus 89.6 were examined in U87.CD4.CCR5 cells (B); CCR5 tropic viruses AD8 and JRFL and dual tropic 89.6 were examined in U87.CD4.CCR5 cells (C). IFITM1 exhibited a stronger inhibition of any viruses, including CCR5 viruses, than IFITM2 and IFITM3 did (Figure 1B,C). the efficiency of entry by the dual tropic 89.6 in U87.CD4.CCR5 cells was extremely low, as measured by GFP-positive cell population. we produced inGLuc-reporter viruses by co-transfection of HEK293T cells with an HIV-inGLuc (Env-deficient) vector, a packaging vector 8.2 encoding HIV-1 Gag-Pol and all accessory/regulatory genes, along with the Env construct of interest. 10 A1 was known to be refractory to IFITM restriction; hence, it served as a negative control. IFITM3 showed the strongest inhibition on entry of all T/F Env-mediated HIV-1 into U87.CD4/CCR5 cells. entry of T/F viruses is more sensitive to inhibition by IFITM2 and 3 than by IFITM1. red squares indicate two dual tropic T/F viruses. data are mean SD of at least three independent experiments. the absolute infection efficiency of these T/F viruses was plotted in Figure 2B. IFITM3 showed the strongest inhibition on all of these T/Fs. IFITM2 showed an intermediate level of inhibition (about 23-fold reduction); and IFITM1 showed the least effect (20\u201350%) pBJOX2000, pX1632 and pCH119 T/F strains highly efficient yet other T/F viruses, in particular p246F3, much less efficient. IFITM3 and to a lesser extent IFITM2 were more potent than IFITM1 to inhibit entry mediated by NL4.3, AD8 and 89.6 Env. efficiencies of NL4.3, AD8 and 89.6 infection were plotted in Figure 3C. IFITM1, 2, 3 expression levels in THP-1/CCR5 cells were examined by immunoblotting using an anti-FLAG antibody. infection of HIV-inGLuc bearing the Env of MLV 10A1, HIV-1 NL4.3, AD8 or 89.6, indicative of entry, was presented. expression levels of IFITM2 and IFITM3 in these THP-1 cells were comparable, as confirmed by western blotting. IFITM2 and IFITM3 are strong inhibitors of HIV-1 entry in CD4+ HIV-relevant T lymphocytes and monocytes, similar to what was observed in U87 cells. we first compared the expression levels of these IFITMs in SupT1 cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged IFITMs and WT IFITMs. interrogated the role of endogenous IFITM proteins in modulating HIV-1 infection in primary human CD4+ PBMCs and purified T lymphocytes. we decided to knock down all three IFITMs altogether by using a mixed pool of human IFITM shRNAs. we compared the overall function of IFITMs on infection of CXCR4 and CCR5 HIV-1 strains. PBMCs from two healthy human donors were activated by 20 IU/mL IL-2 and 5 g/mL PHAP for 3 days. PBMCs were then transduced with lentiviral shRNA control or pooled shRNA IFITMs for 24 h. CD4+ cells were then treated with 500 IU/mL IFN2b for 24 h. cells were infected with virus-inGLuc reporter viruses (F,I) and gaussia luciferase activities were directly measured from the harvested supernatants. data were mean SD of three experiments, each performed in duplicates. the modest effect of type I IFN, especially IFITMs, on HIV-1 entry observed above prompted us to directly compare the effects of type I IFN on one-round HIV infection. a 2-fold reduction of HIV-1 infection in IFN2b-treated CD4+ T cells. knockdown of IFITMs did not significantly rescue the IFN-mediated inhibition on HIV-1 entry. this suggests that endogenous IFITMs in target CD+ T cells do not significantly contribute to IFN-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 entry. some CCR5 viruses, including AD8, YU-2 and certain T/F viruses, are relatively resistant to IFITM-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 infectivity compared with some CXCR4 viruses, such as NL4.3 and dual tropic 89.6 [7]. IFITM1 is expressed predominantly on the plasma membrane and thus more potently inhibit entry of viruses that fuse on the cell surface. it is possible that IFITM1 is intrinsically weaker than IFITM2 and IFITM3 to suppress entry of HIV-1 and other viruses [16,33,34]. we analyzed the effects of IFITMs on entry of 20 subtype B and 12 global clades T/F viruses by using the highly sensitive HIV-inGLuc system. we observed that IFITM1 preferentially blocks entry of all T/F isolates compared with IFITM2 and IFITM3. some T/F viruses were even more potently inhibited by IFITMs, especially IFITM2 and IFITM3. we speculated that this could be due to expression levels of IFITM proteins in our system versus those of Foster et al., even in the same type of target U87 cells. we have observed that FLAG-tagged IFITMs are approximately 25\u201330% more potent than their WTs to inhibit HIV-1 infection. -1 is in viral producer cells that diminishes the viral infectivity but not in target cells to block viral entry. this conclusion is supported by several recent studies."}
