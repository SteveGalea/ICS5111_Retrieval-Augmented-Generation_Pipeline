{"summary": "the potential health consequences of a new pandemic have stimulated attempts to predict what types of virus might emerge in the future. the evolution of viral emergence There is a general, and justifiable, nervousness about predictions in evolutionary biology. predictions of the evolution of more complex multifactorial traits such as host adaptation and emergence are a very different matter. RNA viruses have mutation rates of between 0.1 and 1.0 mutations per genome replication. it is equally well known that RNA viruses jump species boundaries more often than DNA viruses. this likely reflects their differing rates of evolutionary change. the challenge of predicting viral evolution and emergence is reflected in the on-going debate over whether highly pathogenic avian influenza virus will emerge in humans. phylogenetically conserved cell receptors appear better able to jump host species boundaries than those that use more variable receptors. however, receptor usage is not the only factor that mediates successful infection. bats have been found to be important reservoirs for coronaviruses [33, 34], filoviruses [35], lyssaviruses [36], paramyxoviruses [37, 38, 39, 40], and have recently harbor both hantaviruses [41] and influenza viruses [42\u2022\u2022]. future surveying will undoubtedly reveal even more novel bat viruses, although determining which of these might emerge in humans is more challenging. genetic studies of virulence evolution are only informative if it is possible to associate viral strains with specific virulence phenotypes. despite similarity in selection pressures in both Australia and Europe, there are multiple genetic routes to attain either highly virulent or attenuated phenotypes. the difference between MYXV and WNV suggests a more profound relationship between virulence evolution and genome size. there is greater scope for virulence determining mutations in larger DNA-based organisms. emergence prediction will be ever more than an inexact science, revealing broad-scale generalities at best. a comprehensive survey of the phylodynamic patterns exhibited by currently circulating viruses will do much to help us understand how a new virus will evolve and spread once it has emerged. it should be possible to compile a cross virus data base of the parameters that correlate most with successful emergence, such as how rapidly each virus evolves."}
