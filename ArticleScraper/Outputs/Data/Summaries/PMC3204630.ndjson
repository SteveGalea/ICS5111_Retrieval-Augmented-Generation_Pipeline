{"summary": "retrospective cohort study was conducted at 8 large nonfederal acute care health care systems that experience 32% of all inpatient visits and 23% of all outpatient visits in north Carolina (7). the cohort was defined as all inpatients and outpatients at the 8 health care systems assigned a discharge diagnostic code from the international classification of diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), that corresponded with a reportable communicable diseases during a 10-year time period (1995\u20131997, repeated patient visits within a 31-day window for the same disease were enumerated and only the first visit was retained. hepatitis A and paralytic polio were restricted to only the first visit. unadjusted disease-specific reporting completeness proportions were calculated by dividing the number of case-patients that were reported to the NC DHHS. sensitivity analysis was conducted on the specified prior variance, 2, by using high, medium, and low 2 values that assumed 95% of the completeness proportions were within the following ranges. the adjusted disease-specific, completeness proportions ranged from 0% to 82.0%, and almost all diseases (49/53) had completeness proportions 50%. some unexpected diseases had cases identified with an ICD-9-CM code. for example, anthrax had 14 cases identified, paralytic polio had 32 cases identified, human rabies had 12 cases identified, and smallpox had 9 cases identified. the most dramatic adjustments in the unadjusted to adjusted point estimates were noted for staphylococcal foodborne disease, and for foodborne diseases caused by Vibrio vulnificus.
