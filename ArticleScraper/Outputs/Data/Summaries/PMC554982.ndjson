{"summary": "gamma interferon (IFN-) synergizes with the innate IFNs (IFN- and IFN-) to potently inhibit HCMV replication in vitro. as with HSV-1, IFN- synergizes with the innate IFNs (IFN-/) to inhibit HCMV replication in vitro. cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a ubiquitous beta-herpesvirus that affects 60\u201380% of the human population. the lytic replication cycle of HCMV is a temporally regulated cascade of events that is initiated when the virus binds to host cell receptors. HCMV is the leading contributor of congenital viral infections in the united states and Europe. IFN- and IFN- are produced by most cells as a direct response to viral infection [22-24], while IFN- is synthesized almost exclusively by activated NK cells and activated T-cells in response to virus-infected cells. both types of IFNs achieve their antiviral effects by binding to their respective receptors (IFN-/ or IFN- receptors) IFN-/ and IFN- synergistically inhibit the replication of HCMV in vitro and in vivo. treatment of HFFs with IFN-, IFN- or IFN- inhibited HCMV replication by 40-fold in both plaque reduction and viral growth assays. two-hundred IU/ml of IFN-, IFN- or IFN- reduced HCMV plaque formation by only 11-, 37- or 30-fold respectively. the level of inhibition was not significantly greater than the level of inhibition achieved by each IFN at concentrations of 100 IU/ml (P > 0.05) IFN-, IFN- and IFN- 100 1.95 0.04* 25 IFN- and IFN- 100 1.13 0.09* 164 IFN- and IFN- 100 0.52 0.05* 662 IFN-, IFN- and IFN- 100 0.66 0.15* 512 aHFFs were treated in 3 replicates per group. monolayers were infected with 1000 PFU of HCMV strain Towne-GFP. plaque numbers were determined 11 d p.i. by fluorescence microscopy. levels of inhibition achieved with individual IFN treatments were 8-fold for IFN- or IFN- and 18-fold for IFN- at all concentrations tested. tory concentrations were determined from dose response experiments. IC95 isoboles were generated for HFFs treated with both IFN- and IFN-. concave isoboles indicate a synergistic relationship between type I IFNs (IFN- and IFN-) and type II IFN (IFN-) suggesting action via distinct antiviral pathways. combination effect of (C) IFN- and IFN- and (D) IFN- and IFN- and IFN- on HCMV plaque formation on HFFs was plotted in an isobologram. the dashed line represents the theoretical line of additivity. type I IFNs (IFN- or IFN-) and type II IFN (IFN-) treatment, four-day viral growth assays were performed. at 3 d p.i., HCMV replicated to average titers of 8350, 1050 or 985 PFU/ml in IFN-, IFN- or IFN-treated cultures. clovir (GCV)-treated cells, a known DNA synthesis inhibitor of HCMV, inhibited HCMV replication in HFFs. the potent inhibitory effect observed in the presence of IFN- and IFN-- was maintained up to 11 d p.i. the dashed line represents the lower limit of detection of the plaque assay (20 PFU/ml) used to measure viral titers. treatment with IFN- and IFN- does not prevent HCMV entry into HFFs. Ethidium bromide-stained IE exon 4 PCR products amplified from HCMV-infected HFFs pre-treated with either vehicle (A) or 100 IU/ml of IFN- (B), IFN- (C), IFN- (D), IFN- and IFN- (E) or IFN- and IFN- (F) at 6 h p.i., IE1 and IE2 mRNA levels in IFN-treated IE1 or IE2 mRNA expression was inhibited by 2-fold. IE1 or IE2 mRNA expression was repressed by 11- or 8-fold. the degree of IE mRNA inhibition observed in HFFs treated with IFN- was greater than that observed in cultures treated with IFN- alone. IE72 and IE86 protein expression was decreased in cells treated with both type I and type II IFNs. this inhibitory block in IE protein expression was consistent throughout a 48 h time period. this inhibitory block in IE protein expression was consistent throughout a 48 h time period. IE protein expression was detected as early as 1 h p.i. for all treatment groups, IE protein expression was detected as early as 1 h p.i. however, as viral replication progressed IE protein expression among IFN-treated groups varied. by day 5 p.i., nearly 100% of the cells treated with vehicle, IFN- or IFN- alone stained positive for IE72/86. two-hundred IU/ml of IFN-, IFN- or IFN- reduced HCMV plaque formation by only 11-, 37- or 30-fold respectively. the level of inhibition was not significantly greater than the level achieved by each IFN at concentrations of 100 IU/ml (P > 0.05) 512 aHFFs were treated with either 100 or 200 IU/ml each of IFN-, IFN- or IFN- (separately or in combination) plaque numbers were determined 14 d p.i. by fluorescent microscopy. plaque numbers were determined 11 d p.i. by fluorescence microscopy. the level of inhibition achieved with individual IFN treatments was 8-fold for IFN- or IFN- and 18-fold for IFN- at all concentrations tested. concave isoboles shown in Figures 1C and 1D indicate synergistic relationship between type I IFNs (IFN- and IFN-) and type II IFN (IFN-) synergistically inhibit HCMV plaque formation on HFFs. values used to generate the concave isoboles were derived from a dose response curve and represent a combination dose required to elicit 95% inhibition of viral plaque formation. the dashed line represents the theoretical line of additivity. at 3 d p.i., HCMV replicated to average titers of 8350, 1050 or 985 PFU/ml in IFN--, IFN-- or IFN---treated cultures. viral titers in cells treated with IFNs separately were reduced by 6-, 23- or 25-fold, respectively. the potent inhibitory effect observed in the presence of IFN- and IFN- was maintained up to 11 d p.i. the effect was not merely a delay in viral replication in HFFs. treatment with IFN-/ and IFN- does not prevent HCMV entry into HFFs. cells were treated with vehicle or IFNs for 12 hours (h) prior to infection with HCMV. two h after viral adsorption, DNA was isolated from the HCMV-infected cells. treated with either vehicle (A or 100 IU/ml of IFN- (B), IFN- (C), IFN- (D), IFN- and IFN- (E) or IFN- and IFN- (F) from left to right, PCR products were amplified from H2O control, 100 ng of uninfected (UI) HFF DNA or 100 ng of HCMV-infected HFF DNA harvested from cells inoculated for 2 h at MO IE1 or IE2 mRNA expression was repressed by 11- or 8-fold, respectively. the degree of IE mRNA inhibition observed in HFFs treated with IFN- alone was greater than that observed in cultures treated with IFN- alone. IFN-, IFN- and/or IFN- inhibit HCMV IE protein expression. at 12 h p.i., cells were harvested and equal amounts of total protein were examined for IE protein (IE72, IE86) expression by western blot analyses. nearly 100% of the cells treated with vehicle, IFN- or IFN- alone stained positive for IE72/86. approximately 87% of the cells treated with IFN- alone were expressing the IE proteins. in contrast, the percentage of cells expressing IE proteins was significantly reduced (P 0.001) in the treatment groups that received combination IFNs. type I (IFN- and IFN-) and type II (IFN-) IFNs synergistically inhibit the replication of HCMV. the inhibitory effect by IFN-/ and IFN- was synergistic in nature. the inhibition was not matched by increasing the concentrations of each individual IFN. IFNs exert their inhibitory effects at a step after viral attachment and entry. Previously, Yamamoto, et al. (1987) demonstrated that treatment of cells with both IFN- and IFN- potently inhibits HCMV replication. however, this study neither determined whether the effect was synergistic nor identified the mechanism of inhibition. nearly 100% of vehicle- and individual IFN-treated cells expressed IE72/86 5 d p.i. compared to 46% or 21% of cells treated with IFN- and IFN- or IFN- or IFN- or IFN- and IFN- respectively. HCMV cytopathic effect increased over time in vehicle- and individual IFN-treated groups, while morphology was unchanged in cells treated with IFN-/ and IFN-. decrease in IE protein levels exceeds that in IE mRNA levels in response to IFN-/ and IFN-. this suggests that additional regulation at the level of translation, post-translational processing and/or protein stability may be involved. the innate IFNs (IFN-/) synergize with endogenous type I IFNs to inhibit HCMV dissemination. further studies are required to evaluate the role(s) of both type I and type II IFNs in the regulation of HCMV replication. the inoculum was removed and medium containing 1.0% methylcellulose was added to the cells. Plaque numbers were determined 14 d later by fluorescent microscopy. for viral replication assays, vehicle- and IFN-treated HFFs were infected with Towne-GFP at a MOI of 2.5. oboles were generated for IC95 values at various concentrations of IFN- or IFN-. convex isoboles are indicative of synergy while convex isoboles are indicative of an antagonistic effect. HCMV plaque reduction assays were conducted as described above. 1 l of cDNA was amplified in 1X iQ SYBR Green Supermix. the optimal primer concentrations and sequences were as follows. all samples were run on the same plate where those for the internal control (18S rRNA) Western blotting Vehicle- and IFN-treated HFFs were infected with Towne-GFP at a MOI of 2.5. the cells were harvested in 500 l of 1X RIPA buffer containing a protease inhibitor cocktail. indirect immunofluorescence Vehicle- and IFN-treated HFFs were infected with Towne-GFP at a MOI of 1.0. five d p.i., cells were washed 3X with 1X PBS, fixed with 1:1 methanol/acetone for 10 minutes at room temperature, washed again with 1X PBS, and blocked with 4% BSA/PBS for 15 minutes at room temperature. data from IFN-treated groups were compared to vehicle-treated groups. significant differences were determined by one-way analysis of variance. HCMV strain RVdlMwt-GFP propagated in HFFs as previously described. 100 M GCV (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was added to culture medium immediately following infection. titers of infectious virus were determined by a microtiter plaque assay. isoboles were generated for IC95 values at various concentrations of IFN. s are indicative of synergy while convex isoboles are indicative of an antagonistic effect. real-time PCR vehicles and IFN-treated HFFs were infected with Towne-GFP at a MOI of 2.5. cells were washed twice with 1X PBS to remove trypsin and non-adhered virus. 1 l of cDNA was amplified in 1X iQ SYBR Green Supermix. the optimal primer concentrations and sequences were as follows. all samples were run on the same plate where those for the internal control (18S rRNA) and those for the genes of interest were each run in triplicate. Western blotting HFFs were infected with Towne-GFP at a MOI of 2.5. cells were harvested in 500 l of 1X RIPA buffer containing a protease inhibitor cocktail. cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 r.p.m. at 4\u00b0C. five d p.i. cells were washed 3X with 1X PBS, fixed with 1:1 methanol/acetone for 10 minutes at room temperature. cells were then stained with 1:50 Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG F(ab')2 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors' contributions BS and HL conceived of the study, participated in the experimental design, performed all experiments and drafted the manuscript."}
