{"summary": "CHRNA7 is an important gene which encodes neuronal acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha-7 protein (uniprot id P36544) responsive for different neuronal expression. it is a member of a superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels which facilitate fast signal transmission at synapses. gene expression studies show that CHRNA7 gene is primarily expressed in the posterior amygdalar nucleus and the field CA3 of Ammon's horn in the mouse. three-dimensional (3D) structure is the most competent requirement for any advance proteomic analysis or drug designing. method for protein structure determination and verification of modelled structure is done by Ramachandran plot and statistical analysis. STRING is a biological database and web resource of known and predicted protein-protein interactions. alpha-7, CHRNA7 of Homo sapiens (Human) protein sequence is retrieved from UniProt database UniProt id P36544. modeled by homology modeling method using prime program of Schr\u00f6dinger software suite. Blast search is performed to identify template protein structure. chrna7 protein have interaction with CHRNA protein family along with JAK2, AKT1, PICK1 protein that are involved in neurological diseases. table 2 summarizes interacting protein function and involvement with these proteins with neurological diseases. changes in conformation lead to opening of ion-conducting channel across plasma membrane Frontal lobe epilepsy Neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction 3 AKT1 AKT is responsible of the regulation of glucose uptake by mediating insulin-induced translocation Neurological diseases Rap1 signaling pathway, Ras signaling pathway 4 JAK2 Janus kinase 2. non-receptor tyrosine kinase involved in various processes such as cell growth, development, table 1 shows 5 binding sites and scores.
