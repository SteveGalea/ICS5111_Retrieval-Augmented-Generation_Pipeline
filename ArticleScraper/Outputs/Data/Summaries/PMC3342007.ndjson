{"summary": "CD8+ T cells play a major role in protective immunity to a wide variety of pathogens, including viruses, bacteria, and protozoan parasites. different leishmania species have different tropisms and their diversity is reflected in the various clinical manifestations they induce. this is not surprising that the contribution of CD8+ T cells to the immune response against the parasite depends on the clinical form. cross-presentation of secreted leishmanial antigens is confined to an intraphagosomal processing pathway that is TAP- and proteasome-independent. reactivated memory CD8+ T cells efficiently killed Listeria monocytogenes via a mechanism mediated by CCL3. direct killing of extracellular pathogen by CTLs has also been described. to date there is no evidence that CD8+ T cells can mediate protection against leishmania parasites through their cytotoxic activity. however, a possible protective role for cytotoxic T cells should not be excluded. CD8+ T cells in experimental cutaneous leishmaniasis. role of regulatory CD8+ T cells in immunity to L. major has always been controversial. depletion of CD4+ T cells was rendering susceptible mice resistant to L. major infection. if a mouse generates Th2 responses, this will lead to susceptibility. in contrast, Cd8/ and CD8+ T cell-depleted mice fail to control L. major infection. the discrepancy between the findings was clarified by another work. antigen-specific CD8+ T cells produce IFN- but lack cytotoxic activity. antigen-specific CD8+ T cells were expanding up to 50-fold in the spleen and lymph nodes of reinfected BALB/c mice. this expansion correlated with a substantial production of IFN-. 8+ T cell depletion resulted in impaired granuloma formation and exacerbation of liver disease. antigen-specific CD8+ T cells appear to participate in controlling parasite growth in the spleen as well. a prominent function for CD8+ T cells was also described in L. infantum-infected mice. gld and lpr mice lack a functional Fas/FasL pathway. a novel counterregulatory function for a subset of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells has recently been proposed in the L. donovani infection model. mice infected with L. donovani generate CD8+ T cell responses with limited clonal expansion. the extension of the clonal expansion is thought to be correlated with the effectiveness in eliminating pathogens. the cause of this limited expansion is yet unknown and may depend on several factors. the major surface protease of leishmania, gp63, was shown to cleave epitopes within the parasitophorous vacuole, further reducing antigen availability. however, this poor presentation may not be enough to induce and sustain a massive clonal expansion of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. the frequency of CD18+CD45RO+ CD8+ T cells is significantly decreased in the spleen of patients with active VL. CD18+ CD8+ T cells appear in the granulomas of dogs with asymptomatic VL. IL-10-secreting CD8+ T cells appear to represent a transient and reversible state of CD8+ effector T cell differentiation. this subset disappears after the infection is cleared. the majority of the CD8+ T cells showed an effector phenotype. the exact role of CD8+ T cells in L. major infections in humans is not yet known. in vitro studies have also demonstrated that leishmania-specific CTLs are generated upon co-culturing human nave T cells with antigens from L. amazonensis promastigotes. CD8+ T cells in DCL patients show a reduced capacity to respond to antigen-specific stimulation during active infection. these cells showed low cytotoxicity and only produced little IFN- upon stimulation, thus showing typical signs of functional exhaustion. the development of ML is associated with the presence of CTL. neutrophils are typically recruited during a TH17-mediated inflammatory response. this suggests that neutrophils, together with CTLs, may be involved in tissue injury and in the development of immunopathology. CD8+ T cells actively participate in the fight against most leishmania infections in humans. different vaccination strategies have been examined in animal models including leishmanization (Modabber, 1990), killed parasite (Grimaldi, 1995), live attenuated parasite (Titus et al., 1995), and subunit vaccines composed of native proteins from different stages of the parasite\u2019s life cycle. the latter two strategies encompass candidates such as gp63, gp46, LACK, CPB, CPA, Kmp11, LmsTI1, TSA, Le there are reports about different leishmanial antigens eliciting CTL responses in humans. there are reports about different leishmanial antigens eliciting CTL responses. the key point to be considered in vaccine design for a heterogeneous population, such as that of humans. in vitro stimulation to recall memory CD8+ T cells from leishmania-infected individuals and intracellular cytokine assays for IFN--producing cells confirmed that HLA A2 positive individuals that recovered from an L. major infection successfully generated CD8+ T cell responses against peptides derived from LmsTI1 and LPG-3. a better understanding of the mode of activation, the specificity, and effector functions of the various CD8+ T cell subsets generated during Leishmania infections could ameliorate the design of vaccines."}
