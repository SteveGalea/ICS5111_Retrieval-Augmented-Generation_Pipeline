{"summary": "the international health regulations (IHR) entered into force in 2007. it requires countries to report certain disease outbreaks and public health events to WHO. these reporting requirements help the international community prevent and respond to public health emergencies that have the potential to cross borders and threaten people worldwide. the AR14 exercise was conducted on august 11\u201314, 2014, and simulated approximately 15 days in the exercise scenario involving multiple events. a pre-scripted master scenario events list (MSEL) was used to prompt exercise players to react to each scenario event using their existing agency response procedures in a manner similar to an actual incident. the scenario depicted a total of 15 days of two separate disease outbreaks resulting with civilian and military patients. the first incident was an undetected enclosed release at a salad bar in downtown city A in south Korea. the second incident was an open-air release at a convention center in city B in south Korea. 165 discussion forums, 1,294 chat messages, and 77 Request for Information (RFIs) were used during the exercise. participants were asked about the type of information/topic that initiated their agency to act and how the response was carried out. undetected enclosed release at a salad bar in downtown city A in south Korea. initial information provided to players did not specify whether the initial incident was accidental or intentional. the second incident was an open-air release at a convention center in city B in south Korea. the situation evolved into a serious crisis for parts of the country with resource constraints and general unrest. exercise evaluation A brief data collection form was distributed to players to collect information on communication and coordination for each exercise event. participants were asked about the kind of information/topic that initiated their agency to act and how the response was carried out. the data was used as discussion points on the ROK\u2019s preparedness for biological events. effective risk communication during a biological event can have profound effects. a basic goal of public health communication is to provide accurate, accessible information so that a bond of trust can be established between the responding agency and those potentially affected by the event. the importance of traditional epidemiologic characterization should not be neglected when the response to a biological event requires international and inter-agency coordination. the complex nature of a biological event makes application of these policies difficult. the complex nature of a biological event makes application of these policies difficult. participants could actually be given a task to investigate and review mock medical records. participating organizations would perform analysis of laboratory specimens, interview patients, conduct meetings to assess surveillance data and decide on the next steps, draft public health and executive orders, make written requests to other agencies for specific assistance or information."}
