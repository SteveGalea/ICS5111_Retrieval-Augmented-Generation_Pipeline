{"summary": "human infections with H7N9 usually occur following recent exposure to poultry, which causes upper respiratory tract disease to progress into pneumonia and subsequently multiple organ failure. a diagnosis primarily depends on virus detection using nasopharyngeal swabs and blood sampling (2). emergency blood tests revealed a leukocyte count of 5109/l (neutrophils, 83.6%) and a C-reactive protein level of 192 mg/l. a bronchiologram revealed inflammation and left lung consolidation. the patient denied history of diabetes, coronary heart disease, chronic bronchitis, asthma and chronic kidney disease. the patient was clear in mentality, had regular respiration, was cooperative on examination and their walking was not affected. the skin and mucosa exhibited no rash or hemorrhagic spots, and the lip mucosa had no cyanosis. the heart rate of the patient was 98 bpm. the patient was isolated, administered active anti-infective agents (biapenem and azithromycin), an antiviral (oseltamivir; 75 mg/day, orally) and anti-inflammatory drugs (methylprednisolone at 200 mg/day. the case was reported to the Jingnan district center for disease control (Shanghai, China) for nasopharyngeal swabs and blood sampling. the patient fluctuated between 39 and 40\u00b0C, with shortness of breath aggravating. the patient underwent an emergency tracheal intubation for assisted ventilation. on April 10th, the patient exhibited a damaged liver performance. plasma osmotic pressure was 335.74 mmol/l, sodium levels of 4.47 mmol/l, sodium levels of 155 mmol/l and chloride levels of 115.10 mmol/l. the normal reference value is between 280 and 310 mmol/l. on April 14th at 00:55, the patient succumbed to multiple organ failure, which caused cardiac arrest, and subsequently the loss of ventilator breathing. on April 10th 2013, the chest radiograph showed the two pulmonary diffuse ground glass opacities, with a degree of fusion into nodules. the patient experienced chills and fever, without evident cause or regularity, with a maximum temperature of 39.4\u00b0C. a bronchiologram revealed inflammation and left lung consolidation. the patient was suspected of having pneumonia. the patient was admitted to the central hospital of Shanghai Jingan district. written informed consent was obtained from the relatives of the patient. the heart rate of the patient was 98 bpm. the abdomen was soft, with no muscle tension, tenderness or rebound tenderness. the liver and spleen were not palpated under the ribs. a biphasic positive airway pressure ventilator was used for ventilatory support. the patient received nasogastric enteral nutrition liquid. a diagnosis of severe human infection with H7N9 avian influenza was confirmed. blood biochemical analysis revealed glucose levels of 16.8 mmol/l, myoglobin levels of 1,483 ng/ml, creatine kinase levels of 1,561 U/l, lactate dehydrogenase levels of 1,007 U/l, albumin levels of 1,561 U/l, urea nitrogen levels of 15.85 mmol/l, creatinine levels of 4.47 mmol/l, sodium levels of 155 mmol/l and chloride a small amount of coffee colored material emerged from the corner of the lips. a 50-ml volume of the coffee colored substance was drained. the patient was fasted, gastrointestinal decompression was continued and proton pump inhibitor treatment was applied. e human infection with H7N9 avian influenza progresses very rapidly. early detection and diagnosis, which may slow disease progression to prevent severe pneumonia, are essential for improving patient outcome. a latency that is longer than the conventional report or no clear epidemiological contact history should not be considered as exclusion criteria for diagnosis. severe human infection of H7N9 avian influenza often involves multiple systems, with rapid progression and poor prognosis. airway management, prevention of infection, mechanical ventilation, water balance support, electrolyte and acid-base balance, nutritional support and the maintenance of important organ function are key to a successful outcome."}
