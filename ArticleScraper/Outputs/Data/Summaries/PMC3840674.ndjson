{"summary": "a strategy to facilitate manipulation and rescue of classical swine fever viruses (CSFVs) from full-length cDNAs present within bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) is described. this strategy allows manipulation of viral cDNA by targeted recombination-mediated mutagenesis within bacteria. a new BAC (pBeloR26) derived from the Riems vaccine strain has been constructed and modified in the E2 coding sequence. cDNAs corresponding to full-length genomes of pestiviruses have been inserted into BACs. pestiviruses have single stranded positive sense RNA genomes, about 12.3 kb in length. the polyprotein is cleaved into four structural proteins (nucleocapsid protein C, envelope glycoproteins Erns, E1 and E2) and eight non-structural proteins. a range of methodologies that apply bacterial genetics have been developed. the use of homologous recombination allows site-directed mutagenesis of BACs. the main advantage of this method is that there are no target limitations (e.g. based on size or location) and no need for suitable restriction sites. the integration of the modified sequence is performed in vivo. modified live vaccine strain \"C-strain Riems\" mutagenesis includes the substitution of the 9 amino acid (aa) linear TAV-epitope (TAVSPTTLR) present in the E2 protein with the corresponding region (TTVSTSTLA) of a heterologous pestivirus (border disease virus, BDV, strain \u201cGifhorn\u201d) and the replacement of the entire CSFV E2 protein coding region with the whole E2 coding region from the same B notI sites were amplified by long RT-PCR using primers 5\u2032Cstrain_T7_Not1 and 3\u2032CSFV_Not1. the product (ca. 12.3 kbp) was digested with NotI and inserted into similarly digested pBeloBAC11. BACs required for direct genome sequencing were purified from 500 ml cultures using the Large-construct kit. the temperature-sensitive pRedET expression plasmid (Gene Bridges) was introduced into electroporation-competent E.coli DH10B cells containing the parental BAC (phenotype CamR, StrepR) the pRedET expresses the phage lambda proteins red, red and red, under control of the arabinose-inducible pBAD promoter, allowing homologous recombination to occur. samples (30 l) from an E. coli culture containing pRedET and the parental BAC grown overnight at 30\u00b0C in LB media (Cam, Tet) were used to inoculate 1.4 ml of fresh LB media with the same antibiotics to obtain exponentially growing bacteria at 30\u00b0C. rpsL-neo cassette confers Streptomycin sensitivity (StrepS) onto the resistant DH10B strain. the structures of the intermediate BACs were verified by restriction enzyme analysis. the replacement of the rpsL-neo selection cassettes from the intermediate constructs was achieved through counter-selection and Red/ET recombination. the homologous sequences at the ends of the DNA fragment were used to isolate the required derivatives. the resulting construct was named pBeloR26_TAV. the initial intermediate construct (with rpsL-neo) was then used to produce the pBeloR26_E2gif construct. names of BAC constructs begin with \u201cpBelo\u201d and rescued viruses. PCR products consisting of the sequence of interest flanked with homology arms identical to the target area were generated by PCR. pre-heating of single stranded oligonucleotides at 95\u00b0C for 2 min followed by snap-freezing. the structures of the modified BACs were verified by restriction enzyme analysis. immunofluorescence microscopy (typically after 3 days) for expression of NS3 and E2 proteins using specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), these were anti-NS3 (WB103/105, pan-pestivirus), anti-CSFV E2 (WH211, WH303, both CSFV specific) and anti-BDV E2 (WB166, BVDV/BDV specific) the nuclei of cells were visualized using DAPI (Vector clone consensus sequences were aligned using a 454 FLX (Roche) or an Ion PGM (Life Technologies) both newbler (Roche) and the bwa.bwasw alignment algorithm were used for mapping the reads to the expected sequence. clone consensus sequences were aligned using MAFFT in the Geneious software platform (Biomatters) the product (ca. 12.3 kbp) was digested with NotI and inserted into similarly digested pBeloBAC11. all BACs were modified and maintained in E. coli DH10B cells (Invitrogen) grown at 37\u00b0C in LB medium containing chloramphenicol (Cam, 15 g/ml) sensitive pRedET expression plasmid (Gene Bridges) was introduced into electroporation-competent E.coli DH10B cells containing the parental BAC (phenotype CamR, StrepR) the pRedET expresses the phage lambda proteins red, red and red, under control of the arabinose-inducible pBAD promoter, allowing homologous recombination to occur. samples from an E. coli culture containing pRedET and parental BAC grown overnight at 30\u00b0C in LB media (Cam, Tet) were used to inoculate 1.4 ml of fresh LB media with the same antibiotics to obtain exponentially growing bacteria at 30\u00b0C. the PCR product (200 ng) containing the rpsL-neo cassette was introduced into these bacteria using electroporation (as above) the structures of the intermediate BACs were verified by restriction enzyme analysis and sequencing around the inserts. the replacement of the rpsL-neo selection cassettes from the intermediate constructs was achieved through counter-selection and Red/ET recombination. the homologous sequences at the ends of the DNA fragment were used to isolate the required derivatives. the initial intermediate construct (with rpsL-neo) was then used to produce the pBeloR26_E2gif construct (Figure 1). The resulting construct was named pBeloR26_TAV (Figure 1). Names of BAC constructs begin with \u201cpBelo\u201d and rescued viruses. PCR products consisting of the sequence of interest flanked with homology arms identical to the target area were generated by PCR. the recombination was achieved using synthetic single stranded oligonucleotides rather than PCR products. the structures of modified BACs were verified by restriction enzyme analysis and subsequent full-genome sequencing. microscopy (typically after 3 days) for expression of NS3 and E2 proteins using specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) these were anti-NS3 (WB103/105, pan-pestivirus), anti-CSFV E2 (WH211, WH303, both CSFV specific) and anti-BDV E2 (WB166, BVDV/BDV specific) clone consensus sequences were aligned using a 454 FLX (Roche) or an Ion PGM (Life Technologies) both newbler and the bwa.bwasw alignment algorithm were used for mapping the reads to the expected sequence. clone consensus sequences were aligned using MAFFT in the Geneious software platform (Biomatters) pBeloR26 BAC sequence differed from the cDNA sequence in 18 positions. 9 of these lead to predicted amino acid substitutions within the polyprotein. a large insertion (27 nt) in the hypervariable region of the 3\u2032-UTR. cloned BAC cDNA (pBeloR26) and cDNA of the rescued vR26/P-12 Region nt position vRiemser (cDNA) pBeloR26/P-12 region nt position vRiemser (cDNA) aa change (in pBeloR26) Npro 695 G A A A E108K Erns 1427 C T H352Y E1 2364 more than 90% of colonies obtained using this procedure contained the required BAC structure as determined by NotI digestions. the complete genome sequences of the cDNA within two selected BACs, designated pBeloR26_TAV have been verified. the chimeric BAC was designated, pBeloR26_E2gif and the complete virus genome sequence (cDNA) was verified. two different anti-CSFV E2 mAbs, WH211 and WH303, were used for the staining. cells infected with either the vGifhorn or with the chimeric vR26_E2gif could be shown to express the \u201cGifhorn\u201d E2 protein using staining with an anti-BDV mAb. the virus titre (as TCID50/ml) was determined for each passage. titers reached more than 106 TCID50/ml after the 1st passage. cells were infected with viruses from the 12th SFT-R cell culture passage. the anti-BDV-E2 mAb specifically detected infection by the vR26_E2gif/P-12 and did not recognize cells infected with vR26/P-12. each result is in accord with the structure of the viruses. vR26/P-12, vR26_E2gif/P-4 and vR26_E2gif/P-12 were deep-sequenced using both the 454 FLX and Ion PGM platforms. both platforms were close to 100% changed at nt position A10665G compared to the BAC clones. this adaptation is a reversion back to the consensus cDNA sequence of the parental vaccine virus, vRiemser. single nucleotide variant (SNV) data obtained from cDNA generated from the rescued viruses vR26/P-4, vR26/P-12, vR26_E2Gif/P-4 and vR26_E2Gif/P-12.
