{"summary": "the science of resilience is emerging rapidly, boosted up by increased awareness in the policy circles. the concept of resilience derives from a complex, rich and long history and the term is currently used in many fields where it adopts different meanings [2]. in fields related to disaster risk reduction, divergent definitions of resilience have also been noted. the literature shows that we can differentiate between resilience as an outcome measure and as an indicator. the first concept shows resilience post-facto, i.e. once the disturbance has interacted with a community. the second concept generally refers to baseline conditions measurable in a community ante-facto. systematic reviews are widely and successfully used in the medical sciences to provide an answer to a clearly formulated question. aim is to test the usefulness of systematic reviews as a plausible approach to produce evidence-based indicators of resilience to disasters. the concept of resilience derives from a complex, rich and long history. the creation of disaster resilient societies, or those able to absorb the impact and bounce back in a timely manner from any disturbance, is seen as a desirable target to achieve in order to make our societies safer while contributing to their sustainability. a recurrent problem that has been cited by many authors is the lack of a clear definition of resilience. systematic reviews use methodical and unambiguous approaches to locate, select, assess, compile and analyze - quantitatively or qualitatively, empirical evidence. systematic reviews use methodical and unambiguous approaches to locate, select, assess, compile and analyze - quantitatively or qualitatively, empirical evidence [19] the list of terms attempted to capture three main components, using main terms and synonyms to identify: a) outcomes (psychological resilience); b) the event (disasters and/or other stressors); and c) indicators of resilience. an initial test search was made in WoK with key words and synonyms for \u2018psychological resilience\u2019, \u2018natural disasters\u2019 and \u2018indicator\u2019. 58 references were submitted for non-truncated search terms with \"*\" the time span was set at \"All years\", which includes all published articles from 1969 to the 25th January 2013. the search in WoK resulted in 58 references. six articles were excluded as they were considered outside the scope of this review. the remaining 52 references were screened independently. a common final decision on articles to be retained for further review was made. evacuees aged 18 or older living in new Orleans area but residing in Houston, Texas, in emergency shelters (N 8,000 evacuees) no analyses to account for differences were reported Johannesson et al. 2011 Tsunami, South East Asia 2005 All Swedish citizens registered at Swedish airports during the first weeks after the disaster. ifada n = 1,613 (August-September 2004); n = 709 (August-October 2005) analysis of resilient trajectories associated with a set of risk factors using multivariate logistic regressions. likely, the sample represented the distribution in this population on gender, age, place of residence and voting behavior. the six empirical studies provided 53 (non-exclusive) indicators of psychological resilience. authors, year Event, location and year Indicators of resilience. a total of 135 (non-exclusive) resilience indicators were initially identified. for 36 indicators their effect on resilience was unclear or unreported. two reviews focused exclusively on potentially traumatic events were extracted from those extracted from those extracted from reviews focusing more generally on potentially traumatic events. indicators from empirical studies focusing on other stressors as well as reviews were used as a comparison but not as the main source of analysis. all studies were technically well conducted, used state of the art statistical analysis and considered large cohorts. the size of the study populations ranged from 1,331 (hospital-based study on SARS epidemics) to around 6 million in the case of new york citizens potentially affected by the 11/9 terrorists attacks. additional key words for factors related to psychological resilience, such as \u2018coping behaviour\u2019 and \u2018positive emotion\u2019, were further investigated. the outcome of each search was stored, and articles were scrutinized to estimate their relevance. the literature search was performed in the WoK using the access to the \u201cAll Databases\u201d form with key words in the \u201cTopic field\u201d. the time span was set at \u201cAll years\u201d, which includes all published articles from 1969 to the 25th January 2013. search for plurals of the term (e.g. disaster*) was performed in the WoK using the access to the \u201cAll Databases\u201d form with key words in the \u201cTopic field\u201d. the time span was set at \u201cAll years\u201d, which includes all published articles from 1969 to the 25th January 2013. study design, populations targeted, outcome and predictive variables, as well as measures of effect size with their statistical significance were reported here. only a set of these variables, relevant to the study objectives, were reported here (Table 1). longitudinal mail survey using exhaustive sampling 14 months and 36 months after disaster. n = 4,910 at 14 months (T1); n = 3,457 at 36 months (T2) Analysis of resilient trajectories related to exposure levels and bereavement status. questionnaires were administered face-to-face n = 2,752 approximately 6 months after September 11, 2001 Multivariate logistic regression. half should be 18 years old giving a rough final figure of 2,200,000 A longitudinal survey including three waves of interview (September-October 2007, April-May 2008, October-November 2008) income positive Human loss negative Johannesson et al. 2011 Tsunami, South East Asia 2005 Intensity of exposure negative Resilient trajectory (IES-R 41.6 in two measurements) Loss of relatives negative Highly exposed negative Non-impaired mental health (GHQ-12, with cut-off 3 indicating impaired mental health) Female gender negative Loss of relatives negative Older age > 60 years positive Married positive Childhood trauma negative More than 3 traumas in adulthood negative Recent trauma negative Previous psychiatric illness a total of 135 (non-exclusive) resilience indicators were initially identified. within the nine reviews and one theoretical study, a total of 135 (non-exclusive) resilience indicators were initially identified. evidence arising from reviews was very heterogeneous: stressors were often not reported, the direction of effect was often missing, and a description of the resilient outcomes. a qualitative evaluation of the evidence was performed based on the consistency of the effect of each indicator on psychological resilience across studies. four studies were longitudinal and two were cross-sectional but all focused on psychological resilience within a period of 3 years after the disaster. each resilient indicator was derived from controlled analysis in which the confounding or moderating effect of other covariates was also considered. four of the five studies found low disaster-exposure levels to predict higher psychological resilience. loss of relatives or friends was an important predictor of lower psychological resilience in the two studies that clearly tested this hypothesis. ethnicity played a different role in different settings and its use as an indicator is neither clear nor straightforward. being Asian played a positive role on resilience, while other minorities (other than African American and Hispanic) were at higher risk of a worse psychological outcome. four of the five studies found low disaster-exposure levels to predict higher psychological resilience. loss of relatives or friends was an important predictor of lower psychological resilience in the two studies that clearly tested this hypothesis. the effect was contentious with two studies showing a positive effect of older age on resilience, and another showing a negative effect on resilience among Israelis. contrasting results with religiosity playing a positive role among Palestinians but having a negative effect on psychological resilience among Israelis [24,25]. social support, gender, previous trauma, degree of disaster-exposure, human losses, resource loss, and physical and mental health are the most important indicators. authors previously suggested different levels of symptom reporting (women reporting more often, men being more reserved) as a plausible explanation for these differences. studies only consider observable variables (indicators) that were considered by the researchers conducting each study. the heterogeneity found in resilient outcomes precluded meta-analysis. a number of indicators focused on personality traits (e.g. positiveness, hardiness) that enhance resilience. two of the articles examined assessed resilience based on the 10 and 17-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale respectively [35,36], which is rather a measure of future individual\u2019s resilience than an outcome. one study focused also on intensive care unit nurses, who cannot be assumed to be representative of the general population [36], the focus of our study. reviewers seek to answer a specific question and should include: 1) clear inclusion/exclusion criteria to select the available evidence, 2) an explicit search strategy, 3) systematic coding and analysis of included studies, 4) meta-analysis (if possible) the authors declare that they have no competing interests. supervised and contributed to data collection, analyzed and interpreted the data, and wrote the paper.
