{"summary": "synthetic cell penetrating peptides (CPP) as oligoarginine have generated a large interest for their seemingly unique mechanism of membrane translocation. both assumptions have had to be re-visited since cellular uptake does involve endocytosis (2) and transport of biomolecules does not occur as efficiently as anticipated at least at low concentrations. we had no clear explanation for the improved efficiency of (R-Ahx-R)4\u2013PMO and (R-Ahx-R)4\u2013PNA conjugates as compared to Tat\u2013PMO and (Arg)n\u2013PMO conjugates. differences could originate from a different mechanism of cellular uptake. r-Ahx-R)4\u2013PMO conjugates were rapidly degraded in cells at these arg\u2013arg bonds (11). this suggests that the biological activity of these conjugates is due to the small portion of material escaping from endocytic vesicles. the manuscript aims at comparing series of (R-Ahx-R)4\u2013PMO conjugates analogs differing in Arg spacer length, in hydrophobicity of the spacer and in stereochemistry of Arg. Criteria for the comparative evaluation of these conjugates include cellular uptake, splicing correction efficiency, affinity for heparin, and synthetic membrane-destabilizing potential. cell pellet was resuspended in ice-cold PBS containing 0.5% FBS and 0.05 g/ml propidium iodide (PI) cells stained with PI were excluded from further analysis. at least 20 000 events per sample were analyzed. conjugates were eluted in 30 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min of 2.5 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7) by a linear gradient of NaCl from 70 to 970 mM. results are presented as eluting NaCl concentrations and expressed as the mean and standard deviation of triplicate measurements. cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, lysed with Reporter Lysis Buffer. cells were then washed with 2 M FAM-labeled (R-X-R)4\u2013PMO in absence of 20 g/ml saponin for 30 min in OptiMEM medium. lipids dissolved in benzene/methanol were freeze-dried overnight. the suspension was vigorously agitated with a Vortex, freeze-thawed 10 times and then extruded 10 times through two stacked 100 nm polycarbonate filters. free dye and quencher were then removed by gel filtration on a PD-10 desalting column (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA) cell cultured as exponentially growing subconfluent monolayers in DMEM medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1 mM Na pyruvate and nonessential amino acids. Flow cytometry was performed with a BD FacsCanto flow cytometer. ml of complete medium (DMEM plus 10% FBS) was added and incubation was continued for 20 h. cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed with Reporter Lysis Buffer. X-R)4\u2013PMO conjugate were injected in triplicate on a 4.6 250 mm column. the conjugates were eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min of H2O/0.1% TFA. eluting acetonitrile concentrations were followed by UV absorption at 260 nm. the distribution of fluorescence in live unfixed cells was analyzed on Zeiss Axiovert 200M fluorescence microscope. lipids dissolved in benzene/methanol (95:5) were freeze-dried overnight. lipid powder was hydrated in a buffer containing the ANTS fluorescent dye 8-aminonaphthalene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid. all lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc., alabaster, AL. leakage of ANTS/DPX was measured as an increase in fluorescence intensity of ANTS upon addition of the CPP\u2013PMO conjugates (5 M final concentration) to 2 ml of vesicles (25 M) (17). each experiment was made in triplicate. Mean values for all conjugates were compared to the mean value of the reference conjugate using Student's t-test. (R-X-R)n\u2013PMO conjugates were injected on a C18-Sepharose column and eluted by a linear gradient of acetonitrile. results are presented as eluting acetonitrile concentrations. each experiment was made in triplicate. samples were treated and data were processed as described in the legend of Figure 2B. the difference is not statistically significant; NS indicates that the difference is not statistically significant. we evaluated the splice correcting ability of (R-X-R)n\u2013PMO conjugates with n 3. Arg)9\u2013PMO has an even higher affinity for heparan sulfate than (R-G-R)4\u2013PMO and is less active in splicing correction efficiency. compound 7 was thus expected to be more active in splicing correction than compound 5 which was not observed. however, increasing the hydrocarbon spacer length also increases hydrophobicity which could itself be promoting unfavorable membrane interactions. a series of PMO conjugates (compounds 8\u201311 in Figure 2A) have hydrophobicities comparable to the parent (R-Ahx-R)4\u2013PMO (compound 5) taken as a reference while others (compounds 8\u201310) have a significantly higher hydrophobicity. differences in splicing correction in this series were largely influenced by hydrophobicity. (r-Ahx-R)4\u2013PMO was significantly less efficient in splicing correction than (r-Ahx-R)4\u2013PMO (Figure 3B) both L- and D-Arg-containing peptides have similar hydrophobicities. cells were incubated for 4 h in Opti MEM with 1 M of (R-Ahx-R)4\u2013PMO, (R-AbuL-R)4\u2013PMO or (R-AbuL-R)3\u2013PMO. cellular uptake does not limit splicing correction. most of the material was distributed as punctate cytoplasmic material. none was detected in the nuclei. a similar situation has been observed for other (R-X-R)4\u2013PMO\u2013FAM conjugates. splicing correction never reached levels achieved with 2-OMe ON analogs transfected as lipoplexes. saponin treatment protocol allows to gently permeabilize the plasma membrane. it was shown to open transient holes in the plasma membrane and to allow passage of macromolecules while not damaging membranes from intracellular organelles. significant luciferase expression could already be detected upon 30 min incubation in saponin-treated cells. splicing correction reached similar levels for conjugates found much less active in nonpermeabilized cells than (R-Ahx-R)4\u2013PMO. data were expected if saponin permeabilization of the plasma membrane allows to bypass endocytosis and as a consequence endosome segregation. differences in splicing correction efficiency were also expected to be abolished if caused by differences in trafficking efficiency. the more hydrophobic (R-AbuL-R)4\u2013PMO conjugate induced considerably less leakage than (R-Ahx-R)4\u2013PMO (Figure 8). the more hydrophobic (R-AbuL-R)4\u2013PMO conjugate induced considerably less leakage than (R-Ahx-R)4\u2013PMO (Figure 8) a 6-carbon 6-aminohexanoic acid linker seemed optimal for cellular uptake as measured by the whole cell fluorescence. a series of (R-X-R)4\u2013PMO conjugates with X varying from 2 to 8 carbons (compounds 1\u20137 in Figure 1A) each experiment was made in triplicate. Mean values for all conjugates were compared to the mean value of the reference conjugate using Student's t-test. each experiment was made in triplicate. Mean values for all conjugates were compared to the mean value of the reference conjugate. the difference is not statistically significant. we evaluated the splice correcting ability of (R-X-R)n\u2013PMO conjugates with n 3 as a possible strategy to reduce cytotoxicity. a sufficient affinity for these negatively charged proteoglycans is required for cell binding and subsequent cellular uptake. too much affinity for heparan sulfate might be detrimental for the release of CPP\u2013ON conjugates from endocytic vesicles compound 7 was therefore expected to be more active in splicing correction than compound 5 which was not observed (Figure 1C). however, increasing the hydrocarbon spacer length also increases hydrophobicity which could itself be promoting unfavorable membrane interactions. PI uptake has been monitored in parallel as an index of cell membrane integrity. we have compared a series of PMO conjugates (compounds 8\u201311 in Figure 2A) with the same spacing (a 6-carbon atom spacer as in (R-Ahx-R)4\u2013PMO) but with varying side-chain hydrophobicities. some compounds in this series (11 in Figure 2A) have hydrophobicities comparable to the parent (R-Ahx-R)4\u2013PMO (compound 5) taken as a reference while others (com (r-Ahx-R)4\u2013PMO was significantly less efficient in splicing correction than (R-Ahx-R)4\u2013PMO. both L- and D-Arg-containing peptides have similar hydrophobicities. all conjugates were synthesized as fluorescent FAM conjugates. cellular uptake does not limit splicing correction. no correlation between cellular uptake and splicing correction activity. splicing correction is probably due to the small amount of material which has escaped from the endocytic vesicles and remains undetectable by fluorescence microscopy analysis. no concluding data have been provided by fluorescence microscopy comparative analysis. the (R-Ahx-R)4\u2013PMO\u2013FAM conjugate was widely distributed within the cell with a clear accumulation in nuclei in saponin-permeabilized cells. it was shown to open transient holes in the plasma membrane and to allow the passage of macromolecules while not damaging membranes from intracellular organelles (22). heLa pLuc 705 cells were incubated for 30 min in OptiMEM. expression was quantified 24 h later and expressed as RLU per microgram protein. each experiment was made in triplicate. Means of triplicates and standard deviations (error bars) are indicated. cellular uptake is not the limiting factor in the efficiency of splicing correction by (R-X-R)4\u2013PMO conjugates. cellular uptake is not the limiting factor in the efficiency of splicing correction by (R-X-R)4\u2013PMO conjugates and therefore intracellular trafficking and endosomal escape likely to be major limiting factors. CPP\u2013PMO-induced leakage of encapsulated dye from lipid vesicles mimicking late endosome membrane. conjugates (5 M final concentration) were added to 2 ml of liposomes (25 M) in MES buffer. significant improvement over first generation CPPs as Tat, Pen, oligoarginine or oligolysine since they allow a sequence-specific splicing correction at lower concentrations. (R-Ahx-R)4\u2013PMO conjugates lead to a sustained expression of dystrophin in skeletal muscles when injected intraperitoneally (5 mg/kg) in DMD mice. (R-Ahx-R)4\u2013PMO conjugates in terms of splicing correction efficiency had a bell-shaped profile with (R-Ahx-R)4\u2013PMO significantly more efficient than (R-G-R)4\u2013PMO. these observations do strongly suggest that another step than cellular uptake is responsible for differences in splicing correction efficiency among these (R-X-R)4\u2013PMO conjugates. the parent and most active (R-Ahx-R)4\u2013PMO conjugate was rather resistant to proteolytic degradation in serum but was still cleaved by cellular proteases (11) r-Ahx-R)4\u2013PMO was significantly less active than (R-Ahx-R)4\u2013PMO thus indicating that metabolic stability is not a limiting factor at least in these in vitro experiments. AR studies have pointed to the influence of heparin affinity and hydrophobicity on the splice correcting activity of CPP\u2013PMO conjugates. cellular uptake could not be an explanation since, on the contrary, we have observed in some instances an inverse correlation between cellular uptake and biological activity. we deliberately permeabilized cells by a brief treatment with saponin, using conditions known to have little impact on the internal cellular architecture (22). more active (R-X-R)4\u2013PMO conjugates in this series destabilize more efficiently these lipid vesicles than less active ones. most of the material unfortunately remains segregated in endocytic vesicles even for the most active of our conjugates."}
