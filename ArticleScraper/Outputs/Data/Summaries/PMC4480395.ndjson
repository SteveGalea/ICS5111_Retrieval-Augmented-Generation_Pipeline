{"summary": "Respiratory specimens were collected from 2 independent groups of mixed-age dromedary camels (Camelus dromedaruis) the first collection was obtained during April 2013\u2013May 2014 at the al Omran Abattoir in al-Ahsa province. animal slaughtered include cattle, goats, sheep, and camels originating from al-Ahsa and neighboring provinces. 96 nasal swab specimens were collected from animals at 3 locations in al Ahsa province. a second sample consisted of 94 from visually healthy dromedary camels and 2 from camels with nasal and lachrymal discharge. both swab and lung specimens were transported on ice to the laboratory within 1\u20132 hours of collection and stored at 80\u00b0C until testing. RNA was extracted from 140 L of each nasal swab or lung sample by using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. rRT-PCR was performed by using an assay kit provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC; Atlanta, GA, USA) all samples were screened by gel-based RT-PCR and 2 rRT-PCR assays. cDNA was prepared from 20 positive samples and shipped to CDC for independent confirmation and sequencing. nucleotide Sequencing and Phylogenetic analyses were performed by using ClustalX version 1.83 implemented in BioEdit version 7.2.5. dromedary camels are housed in small groups (10\u201315 animals) at the livestock market in al-Ahsa. samples were taken from slaughtered dromedary camels on 8 occasions (every 1\u20132 months) tissue specimens were collected from the lungs of all slaughtered dromedary camels. a second sample was collected from age-matched animals over the same period. a long sterile flexible swab was inserted into 1 nostril until slight resistance was felt. both swab and lung specimens were transported on ice to the laboratory within 1\u20132 hours of collection. RNA was extracted from 140 L of each nasal swab or lung sample by using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. rRT-PCR was performed by using an assay kit provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC; Atlanta, GA, USA) all samples were screened using gel-based RT-PCR and 2 rRT-PCR assays. cDNA was prepared from 20 positive samples and shipped to CDC for independent confirmation and sequencing. a total of 91 lung tissue samples and 96 nasal swabs were obtained. 84 (44.9%) of 187 animals were MERS-CoV positive by RT-PCR. the proportion of positive samples from both groups varied by month and year. for months when specimens were available from both groups, the proportion of positive samples from both groups was highest during the cool months. cDNA prepared from 20 samples positive for MERS-CoV by RT-PCR were shipped to CDC for independent confirmation. only 4 samples had cDNA of sufficient quality for successful sequencing. sequences from camel C7 most closely matched sequences obtained from a human in Hafar Al-Batin in 2013. the estimated neighbor-joining tree was constructed from nucleotide alignments. number in parentheses denote number of additional available identical spike gene sequences obtained from same identified region. authors found proportionately more positive animals near the border with a higher proportion of animals tested in al-Ahsa. this proportion was within the upper range previously reported. rRT-PCR detected MERS-CoV in 38.5% of nasal swab samples. trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles were euthanized 5 days after inoculation. viable virus was not recovered from tissues of 2 other animals at 28 and 42 days after inoculation. the upper respiratory tract was the predominant site of virus replication. nasal discharge was consistent with those of Hemida et al. (16), and Adney et al. (23), who documented appearance of purulent nasal discharge in the 3 experimentally infected adult dromedary camels. we also detected MERS-CoV RNA in a higher proportion of specimens from younger than from older adult dromedary camels. serologic studies of animal handlers in Saudi Arabia have shown limited evidence of MERS-CoV infection (32\u201334) the overall contribution of zoonotic infections to community-acquired MERS-CoV remains unclear. authors observed a slight, temporary increase in cases among humans in June and September 2013."}
