{"summary": "human metapneumovirus (HMPV) has an important etiological role in acute lower respiratory infections in children under five years. a prospective study performed on all children under 14 years of age with a respiratory tract disease admitted to a secondary hospital between September 2005- June 2014. at least one respiratory virus was detected in 75.2% of them. pneumovirus (HMPV) is an RNA virus belonging to the Pneumoviridae family, genus Metapneumovirus. two main genetic lineages A and B have been identified to date. phylogenetic studies showed a high similarity to the respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), with which it shares morphological and disease spectrum similarities. laryngotracheobronchitis was associated with inspiratory dyspnea and wheezing. cases with both focal infiltrates and consolidation in chest X-rays classified as pneumonia. RNA and DNA from 200 l-aliquots of NPA were processed within 24 hours. single HMPV infections were also compared with single infections by HRSV, human rhinovirus (HRV), adenovirus (HAdV) and human bocavirus (HBoV). clinical characteristics and laboratory variables were compared using the Student t-test, the Mann-Whitney U test, the chi-2 test, and Fisher\u2019s exact test. clinical specimens consisted of a nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) taken from each patient at admission. all clinical specimens were sent for virological investigation to the Respiratory Virus and Influenza Unit. RNA and DNA from 200 l-aliquots of NPA were extracted by using the QIAamp Mini Elute Virus spin kit in an automated extractor. a total of 3906 children under 14 years of age were admitted to the Severo Ochoa Hospital with acute respiratory tract infections. the mean age was 21.68 33.8 months. at least one respiratory virus was detected in 75.2% of them. 8% (125/214) were males, 15.5% were preterm infants. bronchiolitis and recurrent wheezing were the main clinical diagnosis. hypoxia was present in 65% (140/214) of the patients. 2.4 0.095 Days of hospitalization* 4.2 2.1 4.9 2.6 0.042 X-ray Infiltrate 43 (48.3%) 24 (46.2%) 0.804 Normal 46 (51.7%) 28 (53.8%) Diagnosis 0.529 Recurrent wheezing/ asthma 65 (60.7%) 43 (67.2%) Bronchiolitis 32 (29.9%) 15 (23.4%) Pneumonia 9 (8.4%) 4 (6.2%) Laryngitis 1 (0.9%) 2 ( single HMPV infections (n = 133) were selected and compared with single infections of the most frequent viruses detected in the same period.

HMPV patients had less frequent hypoxia than HRSV ones, the duration of the hospitalization was shorter and the diagnosis of recurrent wheezing was more frequent."}
