{"summary": "human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) is a main cause of the common cold. severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) cause severe respiratory disease that can be life-threatening to humans. all coV virions encode a set of four structural proteins. spike glycoprotein (S), small envelope protein (E), membrane glycoprotein (M) and nucleocapsid proteins (N). the trimeric S glycoprotein is a class I fusion protein and mediates attachment to the host receptor. we rescued a mutant QX-type IBV with the furin-S2\u2032 site. we compared the pathogenicity of the mutant IBV with its parental virus. we also investigated the tissue and cell tropism. plasmid with furin-S2\u2032 site was generated by vaccinia recombination. furin-S2\u2032 site was introduced into YN cDNA by homologous recombination. after 48 h of incubation, cells were repeatedly subjected to freezing and thawing three times. samples of cells and culture supernatant were collected at 1, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 h post-inoculation (hpi) the samples were subjected to RT-qPCR analysis to quantify virion production. the viral loads were determined with the light cycler 96 real-time PCR system. the third group was inoculated with 100 L of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as a negative control. ten chickens of each group were used only for observation. the other ten were used for sampling. the reaction was visualized using 3,3-diaminobenzidine (DAB; Sigma) for 10 min. sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and examined by light microscopy. the scores from 0 to 10, reflecting the severity of the lesions, were recorded. chicken embryos were divided into three groups, vaccinated with 105.0EID50. two weeks later, two groups were inoculated with 100 L of rYN or rYN-S2/RRKR 105.0EID50. all chickens were observed for 2 weeks after infection. plasmid with furin-S2\u2032 site was generated by vaccinia recombination. plasmid was introduced into YN cDNA by homologous recombination. after 48 h of incubation, cells and supernatant were repeatedly subjected to freezing and thawing three times and inoculated into 10-day-old SPF embryonated eggs. samples of cells and culture supernatant were collected at 1, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 h post-inoculation (hpi) the samples were subjected to RT-qPCR analysis to quantify virion production. the viral loads were determined with the light cycler 96 real-time PCR system. ten chickens of each group were inoculated with 100 L of phosphate-buffered saline. the third group was inoculated with 100 L of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as a negative control. the reaction was visualized using 3,3-diaminobenzidine (DAB; Sigma) for 10 min. sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and examined by light microscopy. the scores from 0 to 10, reflecting the severity of the lesions, were recorded. sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and examined by light microscopy for lesions. intensity of viral antigen was detected in the same tissue sections prepared for IHC. chicken anti-IBV-YN hyperimmune serum was inactivated at 56 \u00b0C for 30 min. the diluted serum was incubated with the same volume of rYN or rYN-S2/RRKR containing 200 EID50 at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. after 6 days, the embryos were examined for dwarfing. embryo infectious dose (EID50) of rYN-S2/RRKR in embryonated eggs was approximately one-tenth that of rYN (106.5EID50/0.1 mL for rYN-S2/RRKR versus 107.17EID50/0.1 mL for rYN) the 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) of rYN-S2/RRKR was more than 1000-fold higher than that of rYN rYN-S2/RRKR causes pronounced Encephalitis 3.2.1. clinical signs and gross Lesions in 1-day-old SPF chicks. one-day-old chicks inoculated with the rYN strain began to show clinical signs of sneezing and listlessness. furin-S2\u2032 site induction caused neurological signs that have never been reported. chicks inoculated with rYN-S2/RRKR strain had mucus and punctate hemorrhage in the larynx and no obvious lesions in the kidney. rYN-S2/RRKR was highly pathogenic to 1-day-old SPF chickens. diseased chickens in the rYN-S2/RRKR group appeared later than in 1-day-old chickens. mortality rate was 20% (2/10) at necropsy of diseased chickens at 13 dpi, mucus and punctate hemorrhage in the larynx and mottled swelling kidney. the furin-S2\u2032 site increased the capacity of IBV-rYN to cause neurological signs in SPF chicks of different numbers of days old. mortality and severity of neurological signs were age-dependent. however, the furin-S2\u2032 site decreased the damage in the respiratory and urinary systems. rYN-S2/RRKR could cause serious injury in the respiratory and urinary systems of 1-day-old chicks. but only rYN-S2/RRKR could significantly injure the CNS. white triangles indicate clear mucosal thickening and infiltration of inflammatory cells in the trachea. dilation of kidney tubules, inflammatory cell infiltration, hemorrhage in the kidney interstitium and cellular cast were observed in kidney of the rYN-S2/RRKR-inoculated group. rYN-S2/RRKR caused mild injury in the respiratory and urinary systems of 3-week-old chicks compared with rYN and severe injury in the CNS. sections stained with H&E were evaluated and scores from 0 to 10 were recorded. rYN-S2/RRKR caused mild injury in the respiratory and urinary systems of 3-week-old chicks compared with rYN, but still caused severe injury in the CNS. rYN-S2/RRKR is neurotropic and decreases epithelial tropism in vivo. there were more rYN-positive cells in the kidney than for rYN-S2/RRKR. there were no positive cells in brains of both rYN and negative control groups. no chickens vaccinated with SZ130 showed any clinical signs after inoculation with rYN or rYN-S2/RRKR during the observation period (Table 2). there were clear differences in pathogenicity including clinical signs, tissue tropism and mortality between rYN and rYN-S2/RRKR. QX-type IBV vaccine can protect SPF chickens from rYN-S2/RRKR. rYN-S2/RRKR was highly fatal to 10-day-old SPF embryonated eggs. rYN-S2/RRKR inoculation caused all embryonated eggs to die within 36 h post-inoculation (hpi), whereas this required more than 96 hpi in rYN. two-way ANOVA was used for analysis of differences in GraphPad Prism 7.0. the significance was considered as follows: highly significant at p 0.01 (**), very highly significant at p 0.001 (***) and extremely significant at p 0.0001 (****) nine out of 10 chicks infected with rYN-S2/RRKR during the observation period; the mortality was 90%. survival results showed that the furin-S2\u2032 site clearly increased the lethality of the rYN strain to 1-day-old SPF chickens. necropsy at 9 dpi on 1-day-old chickens inoculated with rYN or rYN-S2/RRKR. mucus and punctate hemorrhage in the larynx and trachea were observed. mucus and punctate hemorrhage in the larynx and trachea were observed. mortality rate of 3-week-old SPF chickens was 20% (2/10) the mortality rate of rYN-S2/RRKR in 3-week-old chicks was 20%. chicks inoculated with the rYN strain showed the same findings as 1-day-old SPF chicks, with punctate hemorrhage in the larynx, numerous urate deposits in the ureter and kidney swelling. rYN and rYN-S2/RRKR could cause serious injury in the respiratory and urinary systems of 1-day-old chicks. only rYN-S2/RRKR could significantly injure the CNS. microscopic lesions could be observed in trachea and kidney in both virus-inoculated groups. both rYN and rYN-S2/RRKR caused serious injury in the respiratory and urinary systems of 1-day-old chicks. rYN-S2/RRKR caused severe injury in the CNS (n = 4) in samples of 3-week-old chicks, hemorrhage in mucosa and serosa was seen. the black arrow indicates the cellular cast in kidney interstitium. the blank arrows indicate inflammatory cell infiltration in kidney interstitium. the panel indicates substantial microglial hyperplasia in the brain. the presence of rYN-S2/RRKR antigen was detected in neurons. there were more rYN-positive cells in kidney than for rYN-S2/RRKR. there were no positive cells in brains of both the rYN and negative control groups. one-day-old chicks inoculated with rYN-S2/RRKR began to show clinical signs of sneezing and listlessness at 5 days post-inoculation. chicks in the rYN-S2/RRKR-inoculated group began to show clinical signs of diarrhea and unexpectedly neurological signs. rYN-S2/RRKR was highly pathogenic to 1-day-old SPF chickens. mortality rate of rYN was 90% (9/10) and mortality rate of rYN was 10%. diseased chickens appeared later than in 1-day-old chickens. there were no obvious gross lesions in the rYN-S2/RRKR group and negative control group. pathogenicity experiments were performed on 3-week-old chicks. chicks inoculated with rYN began to exhibit listlessness at 11 dpi. ions in trachea and kidney were consistent with the gross lesions described above. dilation of kidney tubules, inflammatory cell infiltration, hemorrhage in the kidney interstitium and cellular cast were detected in kidney of 1-day-old chicks. in brain samples, there were no lesions in brains from rYN and negative control groups. results of H&E-stained brain sections from the rYN-S2/RRKR group. panel indicates substantial microglial hyperplasia, forming microglial nodules in the brain. no obvious lesions were observed in the brain of rYN and control groups. rYN-S2/RRKR caused mild injury in the respiratory and urinary systems of 3-week-old chicks compared with rYN. microscopic lesions were observed in tissues of 3-week-old SPF chicks. white triangle indicates hemorrhage in mucosa and serosa in trachea. the formation of perivascular inflammatory infiltrates indicates that the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) was broken and the central nervous system was damaged. the results revealed the presence of rYN and rYN-S2/RRKR antigen in the renal tubular epithelial cells from rYN- or rYN-S2/RRKR-inoculated groups. the detection of IBV was evaluated as the number of positive cells per section from each microscopic field through a ranked score of 0\u20134. there were more rYN-positive cells in the kidney than for rYN-S2/RRKR. there were more rYN-positive cells in the kidney than for rYN-S2/RRKR. a furin cleavage site immediately upstream of the fusion peptide in the S protein of QX-type IBV is related to the pathogenesis of IBV in brain. the furin-S2\u2032 site increases the pathogenicity and changes the cell tropism of classical QX-type IBV, but does not change the antigenicity. original serum and vaccine can still provide effective protection in vivo and in vitro. the furin-S2\u2032 site plays an important role in the pathogenicity of IBV, besides adaptation to its host cell. MHV-JHM can infect oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and microglia, which are responsible for secreting cytokines and chemokines. we used homologous modeling to predict the structure of original and mutant S proteins according to the structure of IBV S protein. we found that the S2\u2032 site is located on the surface of the S protein and can be modified by furin. meanwhile, IBV with mutant S protein can infect neurons."}
