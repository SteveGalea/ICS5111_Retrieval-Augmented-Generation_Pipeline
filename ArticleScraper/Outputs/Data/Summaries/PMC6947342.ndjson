{"summary": "rapid response to an outbreak caused by an unexpected viral pathogen requires the existence of broad-spectrum, antiviral therapeutics. vaccines still do not exist to prevent infections by west Nile virus or severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, and these outbreaks occurred more than one decade ago. increased RdRp fidelity decreases recombination efficiency. it will likely be impossible to attribute a single biochemical property of the RdRp to biological outcome. the most extensively studied PV fidelity mutants encode RdRps with amino acid substitutions at sites remote from the active site. the desire to attribute single, biochemical properties of the viral RdRp to fitness, virulence, and pathogenesis may be futile. the desire to attribute single, biochemical properties of the viral RdRp to fitness, virulence, and pathogenesis. cDNA bearing 8 synonymous substitutions in the oriI cis-acting replication element (CRE) located in the 2C-coding region and was described previously [23]. cDNA bearing a 3C protease cleavage site at its carboxyl terminus was inserted between the IRES and the P1 region of the PV sequence. cells were incubated for 2\u20133 days and then fixed and stained with crystal violet for virus quantification. 2.4. Virus Sequencing Viral RNA was extracted from clarified culture supernatant using a Qiagen RNAeasy Mini kit. DNAse-treated RNA was reverse-transcribed using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) following the protocol provided with the kit. quantification by real-time qPCR was done with 2X TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) unaG green fluorescence reporter was encoded by the acceptor RNA. supernatant at 2\u20133 days post-transfection was used to infect HeLa cells. sym/sub-based template switching assay was described previously. 5 M PV RdRp with 1 M sym/sub RNA primer-template and 500 M ATP for 5 min (Mix 1). template-switching reactions were initiated by addition of 60 M RNA acceptor template and 500 M CTP, GTP, and UTP. all reactions were performed at 30 \u00b0C in 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 60 M ZnCl2 and 5 mM Mg the expression plasmid encoding the various mutations was digested and inserted into an intermediate plasmid, pUC18-BglII-EcoRI-3CD. then the fragment between BglII and ApaI was cloned into the subgenomic replicon, pRLucRA, or viral cDNA, pMovRA, or PV1CRE. we modified the PV1CRE acceptor RNA cells were harvested at 2\u20133 days post-transfection, subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles, and clarified. supernatant was then used on fresh HeLa cells in 6-well plates. cells were incubated for 2\u20133 days and then fixed and stained with crystal violet. one-Step Growth Analysis HeLa cells in 12-well plates were infected by each virus at a MOI of 10. cells were washed twice with PBS and media was replaced with ribavir. cells and supernatant were subjected to three freeze\u2013thaw cycles. media was clarified and used for plaque assays. all yields were normalized to an untreated control. the discs were washed three times for 10 min in 250 mL of 5% dibasic sodium phosphate and rinsed in absolute ethanol. sym/sub-based template switching assay has been described previously. arginine substitution of Lys-359 in PV RdRp catalyze nucleotidyl transfer at 10-fold lower rate than wild type. mutations were observed in motif C, I331F, and the other change was in motif D, P356S. we engineered the various substitutions into a subgenomic replicon. the capsid coding P1 region was replaced with the gene for firefly luciferase, producing luciferase as an indirect measure of viral RNA produced. each double mutant was markedly better than K359H alone, but the addition of I331F conferred a greater replication advantage than P356S. replication was monitored using a subgenomic replicon firefly luciferase. luciferase specific activity is reported in relative light units per microgram of protein in the extract as a function of time post-transfection. this experiment has been repeated more than three times with similar results. viral titer (pfu/mL) was plotted as a function of time post-infection. duplicate infected samples were used for plaque assays. Error bars indicate SEM (n = 2), biological replicates. the error reported is the standard error from the fit of the data to a single exponential [18]. the use of the plaque-forming unit (PFU) as a measure of virus concentration will mask changes in the specific infectivity of the viral RNA. IF-KH and PS-KH PV showed the highest fidelity based on the 2-log difference in sensitivity to ribavirin (Figure 2C) both mutants exhibited essentially equivalent fidelity phenotypes (Figure 2C), suggesting that fidelity had been returned to normal. we have previously reported biochemical properties of the RdRps for the repertoire of mutant viruses described above [18] the acceptor RNA is a replication-incompetent, genomic RNA. initiation of replication on the donor followed by a switch to the acceptor at a site after the oriI locus will yield an infectious genome that can be scored by plaque assay. infectious virus produced by recombination in L929 was scored for infectious virus in HeLa cells 7, 24, and 48 h post-infection for WT. at 48 h only for K359H and PS-KH. the results were, in most cases, quite unexpected. we engineered the acceptor template to encode the unaG [28] green fluorescent protein. the polyprotein is released from capsid precursor protein by 3C protease activity. it is clear that PS-KH PV exhibits a recombination defect. the RdRp-nascent RNA complex moves to new template from internal positions or as a consequence of reaching the end of template. the RdRp-nascent RNA complex moves to new template from internal positions or as a consequence of reaching the end of template, thus creating greater-than-template-length products. polymerase assembles on the primed template (sym/sub-U) the assembled complexes can be identified as the one-nucleotide-extended product (n + 1). Addition of remaining nucleotides in the absence of the acceptor template will yield a strong-strop RNA product (donor). properties of the RdRp required for copy-choice recombination in vitro are separable from those required for forced-copy transfer products were quantified and expressed as a percentage relative to the value observed for WT. the concentrations (M) of transfer product for WT, K359H, IF-KH, PS-KH, and IF-PS-KH are 0.22, 0.22, 0.32, 0.36, and 0.37 respectively. the arginine substitution of Lys-359 (K359R RdRp) and histidine substitution (K359H RdRp) catalyze nucleotidyl transfer at a rate 10-fold lower than wild type. mutations were observed in RdRp-coding sequence that changed the plaque phenotype of the virus. mutations were observed in motif C, I331F, and in motif D, P356S. I331F-K359H, IF-KH; P356S-K359H, PS-KH; and P356S-K359H, IF-PS-KH. we engineered the various substitutions into a subgenomic replicon. the capsid coding region was replaced with the gene for firefly luciferase, producing luciferase as an indirect measure of viral RNA produced. replication was monitored using a subgenomic replicon firefly luciferase. luciferase specific activity is reported in relative light units (RLU) per microgram of total protein in the extract as. function of time post-transfection. this experiment has been repeated more than three times with similar results. cells were infected at MOI 10 with the following PVs: WT, IF-KH, PS-KH, and IF-PS-KH. virus was isolated 24 h post-infection and used for plaque assays. a single correct nucleotide, ATP, (kpol,corr) and a single incorrect nucleotide, GTP, (kpol,incorr) by each PV RdRp was performed as previously described. the error reported is the standard error from the fit of the data to a single exponential [18]. the mutagenic activity of ribavirin would exhibit the greatest negative impact on viruses with a mutator phenotype. IF-KH and PS-KH PVs also exhibited a higher fidelity than WT PV (Figure 2C) the current state of the art for evaluation of recombination in cell culture is based on the co-transfection of two viral (sub) genomic RNAs incapable of producing infectious virus. the donor RNA is a replication-incompetent, subgenomic RNA that encodes a luciferase reporter instead of the viral capsid. the acceptor RNA is a replication-incompetent, genomic RNA that has a defective cis-acting s could not be detected, n.d. is indicated. Statistical analyses were performed using unpaired, two-tailed t-test. a modified PV recombination assay was performed using an acceptor RNA expressing the green fluorescent protein, UnaG. the recombinant viruses produced must be able to form plaques. it was possible that PS-KH PV was defective for virus assembly and/or spread, at least lytic spread. we engineered the acceptor template to encode the unaG [28] green fluorescent protein. RdRp derivatives incapable of recombination exhibit defects in copy-choice recombination (template switching) in vitro. both IF-KH and IF-PS-KH RdRps exhibited near-WT levels of poly (rU) polymerase activity. polymerase assembles on the primed template (sym/sub-U) the assembled complexes can be identified as the one-nucleotide-extended product (n + 1). ATP is added and incorporated to yield a stable elongation complex. the only regions of the gel with bands are shown; these correspond to the sym/sub primer, one-nucleotide-extended primer (n+1), four-nucleotides-extended product (strong stop) and non-templated addition of nucleotides to that product. transfer products were quantified and expressed as a percentage relative to the value observed for WT. H RdRp outperformed IF-KH RdRp, and PS-KH and IF-PS-KH RdRp were essentially identical in activity. we conclude copy-choice and forced-copy-choice recombination use distinct mechanisms, requiring unique biochemical properties of the RdRp. the pKa value of histidine is substantially lower than lysine. the distance between the nucleotide phosphates and the imidazole ring of the histidine will be greater than that of the amino group of lysine. a significant decrease in the specific infectivity of this virus (Figure 2B) the 3D region of the viral genome is also a component of the PV 3CD protein. the protein has well established roles in aspects of the lifecycle before, during, and after replication, including virion morphogenesis. characterization of mutants will be required to identify biochemical properties of the RdRp. the high poly (rU) polymerase activity of PV RdRp derives from template switching during elongation. a second assay that we developed is based on template switching from the end of template. biochemical properties of the viral RdRp determine recombination efficiency. there are at least two distinct mechanisms of recombination. it is difficult to compare one study to another to explain disparate observations made between laboratories. studies have emphasized elaboration of mechanisms governing efficient incorporation of nucleotides (speed) with high specificity (fidelity) but these two parameters are linked to recombination efficiency. the current state of the art precludes association of a single biochemical property to viral fitness."}
