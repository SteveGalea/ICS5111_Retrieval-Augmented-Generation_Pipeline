{"summary": "a definite nosocomial respiratory viral infection was defined as a patient whose number of days from hospital admission to symptom onset exceeded the upper range for the incubation period of the identified virus. a possible nosocomial respiratory viral infection case was defined as a patient whose number of days from hospital admission to symptom onset exceeded the upper range for the incubation period of the identified virus. cases were assigned to a season based on the date when the symptoms of a respiratory viral infection were first documented in the medical record. cases were assigned to a season based on the date when the symptoms of a respiratory viral infection were first documented in the medical record. RESULTS We identified 40 (32 definite and 8 possible) nosocomial viral respiratory tract infections in 38 patients during the study period. the median age of cases in the adult and pediatric hospitals was 56 and 1 year of age. Eleven (28%) of the cases were immunocompromised. fever was the only presenting symptom in 3 of the 23 pediatric cases. all patients adult hospital pediatric hospital 40 17 23 years of age. the most common viruses identified were rhino/enterovirus in both adults and pediatric cases (54%). influenza activity was widespread in Rhode Island March 2, 2015 through April 1, 2016. 63% of cases occurred in the fall and winter but they were identified throughout the year. one adult patient was infected with both adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus. two adult and 3 pediatric patients (13%) died during the hospitalization involving rhino/enterovirus (2 adults, 1 pediatric patient), metapneumovirus (1 pediatric patient), and influenza A. approximately 15 834 adult and 3121 pediatric cases of nosocomial respiratory viral infections in US acute care hospitals yearly. one fatal case involved a nosocomial RSV infection, and another involved nosocomial metapneumovirus infection. autopsy data have confirmed that nosocomial respiratory viral infections can cause or contribute to mortality [7] a pediatric study found that 73% of nosocomial respiratory infections were due to rhinovirus [14] but another pediatric study found that RSV and influenza were associated with 51% and 19% of such cases, respectively. this may reflect differences in virologic diagnostic testing performed as well as the recognition of RSV in patients diagnosed with bronchiolitis at admission. ovirus, influenza A/B, parainfluenza, RSV, Rhinovirus 1.3 nosocomial respiratory viral infections/1000 patient days. despite this policy, nosocomial respiratory viral infections occurred. this most likely reflects inadequate screening of ill visitors and family or ill healthcare workers reporting for duty. hospital policies and national guidelines should focus on reducing patient risk from all respiratory viruses, not just influenza. despite these limitations, we hope our findings will lead to a greater awareness of such infections and changes in hospital infection control policies regarding testing of patients with suggestive symptomatology. the first such study involving patients hospitalized from 1977 through 1979 had a very similar incidence of such pediatric and adult infections compared with our findings. the data suggest that little has changed regarding the risk of such hospital-acquired infections now nearly 40 years later."}
