{"summary": "hMPV is a nonsegmented, enveloped, negative single-stranded RNA virus. it is responsible for lower respiratory tract infections (LRI), especially in extreme ages. hMPV appears to account for 9% of acute pneumonia in patients with haematologic malignancies, in similar proportion to RSV. blood lymphocyte count was low (0.94 G/L), with CD4+ T cells accounting for 39.5% of total lymphocytes. nonproductive cough without dyspnea or chest pain appeared on day 3 of hospitalization. thoracic computed tomography scan was performed on day 6. bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid analysis performed on day 11 showed 450.103 cells/mL. hMPV was also detected in BAL fluid by direct immunofluorescence. bronchiectasis is the most common feature reported in HSCT patients with hMPV, accounting for 73% of patients in one series [7] lymphopenia is the most common feature reported in hMPV patients, accounting for 73% of patients in one series. a prompt recognition would have avoided antibiotic use and further diagnostic studies such as bronchoscopy. early recognition could improve the implementation of appropriate infection control practices to prevent viral spread of this potential life-threatening infection."}
