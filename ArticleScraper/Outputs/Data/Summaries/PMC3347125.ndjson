{"summary": "genus Capripoxvirus, in the family Poxviridae, comprises three closely related species, i.e., goatpox virus (GPV), sheeppox virus (SPV) and lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV) are endemic in africa north of the equator, in the Indian subcontinent (including Nepal, Pakistan, and Bangladesh) loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) occurs under isothermal conditions at temperatures between 60 and 65\u00b0C (24, 26) additional primers, including a forward loop primer (F3) and a forward inner primer (FIP), are typically optional and may be used to accelerate or enhance the sensitivity of the LAMP assay. a metal ion-binding fluorophore, such as calcein (32); and/or (iv) by color change using a metal ion-binding indicator dye such as hydroxynaphthol blue (HNB) (8). the newly developed capripox LAMP assay has analytical and diagnostic sensitivities comparable to those of a highly sensitive qPCR assay (3). LT cells were grown on Eagle's minimal essential medium (EMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 and 100% humidity. monolayers of LT cells formed after 2 to 3 days of incubation. infected cells were checked microscopically for virus-induced cytopathic effects (CPE) DNA was extracted from all sample types (cell cultures, swabs, tissue homogenates, or blood) using 100 l of starting material. eluted with 100 l of kit-supplied elution buffer (buffer AE) designs for all LAMP primers were first attempted using PrimerExplorer v3 software (http://primerexplorer.jp/elamp3.0.0/index.html) the nucleotide sequence of the target amplicon and the LAMP primers (Table 1) were BLAST searched against the NCBI database to ensure their specificity. all were found to have 100% identity to the corresponding nucleotide sequences of the genomes of several isolates of the CaPV genus. the gene encoding the poly(A) polymerase small subunit belongs to ORF068. the gene encoding the mature virion envelope protein P32 belongs to ORF074 of the genome sequence of LSDV-Neethling 2490. all primers used in this study were purified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) all the components of LAMP reaction master mix except betaine (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) were from New England BioLabs (Ipswich, MA) the master mix was prepared without Bst DNA polymerase. the reaction mixture and template DNA were heat denatured at 95\u00b0C for 5 min. the final volume of the master mix was adjusted by compensating the volume of water to make it equivalent to that of HNB. qPCRs were carried out using the GenAmp EZ r Tth RNA PCR kit. reaction master mix consisted of 0.2 M forward primer, 0.5 M reverse primer, 0.2 M minor groove-binding TaqMan probe, 5 l of 5 buffer, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 0.1 U of r Tth DNA polymerase, and 2.5 l of the template. amplification reactions were carried out on a bio-Rad thermocycler using 1 cycle of heat denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 2 min. each cycle consisting of a heat denaturation step (94\u00b0C for 1 min), an annealing step (48\u00b0C for 1 min) and an elongation step (68\u00b0C for 2 min) the resulting PCR product was gel purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen) and clo the copy number of pORF068 was calculated using the following formula: copy number = [mass (g) 6.022 1023]/[length (bp) 650 Da]. Several isolates of CaPVs were used in this study. LT cells were grown on Eagle's minimal essential medium (EMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlas Biologicals, Fort Collins, CO) at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 and 100% humidity. monolayers of LT cells formed after 2 to 3 days of incubation. infected cells were checked microscopically for virus-induced cytopathic effects (CPE) designs for all LAMP primers were first attempted using PrimerExplorer v3 software (http://primerexplorer.jp/elamp3.0.0/index.html) software settings were adjusted to account for an AT-rich template. two highly conserved genes previously identified as particularly well conserved within the CaPV genus were targeted for LAMP primer design. 3 LSDV isolates (LSDV NI 2490, LSDV NW-LW, and LSDV LW 1959), 3 SPV isolates (SPV NISKHI, SPV A, and SPV 10700-99 strain TU VO2127) and 2 GPV isolates (GPV G20-LKV and GPV Pellor) but none to the genomes of other viruses, including the caprine, ovine, and bovine genomes. the gene encoding the poly(A) polymerase small subunit belongs to ORF068. the gene encoding the mature virion envelope protein P32 belongs to ORF074 of the genome sequence of LSDV-Neethling 2490. amplification reactions were carried out using a bio-Rad Tetrad 2 thermal cycler. SPV-Held DNA was serially diluted in nuclease-free water. primers to the template were prepared without Bst DNA polymerase. reaction mixture and template DNA were heat denatured at 95\u00b0C for 5 min. color change of the master mix from violet to sky blue is indicative of a positive reaction (8). forward primer, 0.5 M reverse primer, 0.2 M minor groove-binding TaqMan probe, 5 l of 5 buffer, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 0.1 U of r Tth DNA polymerase, and 2.5 l of the template. qPCR assays were performed in triplicate with appropriate controls, including a positive amplification control (SPV-Held DNA) and a no-template control (water) the resulting PCR product was cloned into plasmid pCR2.1 of the TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) the recombinant plasmid, referred to as pORF068, was propagated in 3 Escherichia coli DH5 cells (Invitrogen), purified using a plasmid purification kit (Qiagen), and verified by sequence analysis. lAMP assays were performed with and without the loop primers (FLP and BLP) using serial dilutions of SPV-Held DNA as a template and the results analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and the color change method. optimum yields of the LAMP products were obtained in 1 h with primers designed from ORF068 and 1.5 h with primers designed from ORF074. the PCR product amplified from SPV DNA with primers F3 and B3 was gel purified and used as a template along with the viral DNA (SPV-HELD) the results demonstrated amplification of LAMP products from both templates. the LOD was determined to be 8 copies of pORF068 per assay by both qPCR and LAMP. in the second step, a 2-fold serial dilution of pORF068 was prepared from a working stock of 1.65 103 ng/l or 3.066 105 copies/l and 2.5 l of sample from each dilution used as the template. LAMP was analyzed by color change using HNB (B) and agarose gel electrophoresis (C) the analytical specificity of the LAMP assay was determined using viral DNA extracted from cell culture-grown virus as the template. all the above-named viruses tested positive by the LAMP assay, and the LAMP products amplified from different isolates were indistinguishable. the analytical sensitivity or the LOD of CaPVs by LAMP was determined using the DNA extracted from serial dilutions of cell culture-grown virus. for performance evaluation, the analytical sensitivity was also determined by virus isolation and qPCR. aliquots of virus suspension from each dilution were inoculated to freshly grown monolayers of primary LT cells. to determine the LOD by virus isolation, aliquots of virus suspension from each dilution were inoculated to freshly grown monolayers of LT cells. three samples (2 swabs and 1 blood sample) which tested positive by qPCR had CT values between 41 and 43, as determined by qPCR. 1 swab and 1 blood sample which tested positive by qPCR had CT values of 41 and 42, respectively. DNA extracted from these samples was amplified by LAMP and qPCR. the overall levels of agreement of test results between qPCR and qPCR were 76 to 100% for swabs, 85 to 100% for blood, and 100% for tissues. the overall levels of agreement of test results between qPCR and qPCR were 76 to 100% for swabs, 85 to 100% for blood, and 100% for tissues. e from infected sheep and goats and skin nodule, skin nodule, skin lesions, and lung from infected cattle. clinical samples were assayed by capripox LAMP and qPCR. the earliest times to detection of caPV were found to be 2 dpi in swabs and 6 dpi in blood and tissues from infected sheep and goats. n = 9) 0/0 ND 0/0 ND 1/1 2/3 Blood (n = 3) 0/0 ND 2/3 ND 3/3 3/3 a Specimens were collected from experimentally infected sheep (n = 3), goats (n = 3), and cattle (n = 3) as described in Materials and Methods and elsewhere (1, 2). pos, positive; ND, not determined. target specificity of the LAMP primers was assessed by PCR and sequence analysis. the viral DNA from SPV-HELD and the positive-control plasmid pORF068 were amplified by PCR with ORF068 LAMP outer primers F3 and B3 as forward and reverse primers. water was used as a no-template control for both PCR and LAMP. the LOD of caPV LAMP was determined using viral DNA extracted from 10-fold serial dilutions of cell culture-grown SPV-HELD as a template. determined to be 3 copies of pORF068 by qPCR (Fig. 4B and C) and 5 copies by qPCR (Fig. 4A), indicating quite similar sensitivities for LAMP and qPCR. LAMP was analyzed by color change using HNB (B) as well as agarose gel electrophoresis (C) all the above-named viruses tested positive by the LAMP assay. the virus isolates used in this study included SPV-Held (6.3 104 TCID50/ml), GPV-Pendik (1.26 105 TCID50/ml), and LSDV-Cameroon (1.26 106 TCID50/ml). 10-fold serial dilutions of virus suspension were inoculated to freshly grown monolayers of primary LT cells and incubated at 37\u00b0C in a CO2 incubator.

PCR-based assays have been reported for rapid diagnosis of viral diseases. PCR is perhaps the most well established molecular diagnostic tool. but AMP is emerging as a promising new method due to its low cost, ease of operation, and high sensitivity and specificity. the software failed to efficiently design all the LAMP primers. the color change method was found to be far more sensitive than the turbidity measurement of the capripox LAMP assay. the color change method failed to produce any visible turbidity in the master mix after the amplification reaction. the accuracy and authenticity of the color change method using HNB were further verified by monitoring the assay by agarose gel electrophoresis. we compared the performance of the LAMP assay with those of the most commonly used standard assays: virus isolation and qPCR. both the analytical and diagnostic sensitivities of LAMP were in close agreement with those of qPCR. the reactions were performed on a 96-well plate in an incubator. the cost-effectiveness advantage of the LAMP assay could further strengthen its use as a diagnostic tool in developing countries where resources are limited."}
