{"summary": "global health issues have long been a concern for foreign-policy-makers. health and disease have been intertwined with the pursuit of foreign-policy interests. fidler calls this a \u201crevolution\u201d in the political status of global health. fidler's final perspective sees the relationship between global health and foreign policy as an evolving dynamic between foreign-policy imperatives and the science of global health. this perspective explains the recent political prominence of global health as a result of the growing impact of disease on traditional security concerns. fidler (2) suggests 3 possible interpretations of global health's rise onto foreign-policy agendas. the first interpretation argues that global health is an important objective of foreign policy in itself. the second interpretation argues that global health can transform the state interests. fidler's final perspective sees the relationship between global health and foreign policy as an evolving dynamic between foreign-policy imperatives and the science of global health. it recognizes that influence runs both ways, arguing: \u201cScientific principles... channel action on health in specific directions that neither ideology nor power politics can alter\u201d. the united states and other countries continue to frame development aid in a foreign-policy context by linking aid to national security and economic interests. since the end of world war II, large donor states have tended to focus bilateral and multilateral aid to support countries judged to be strategically linked to national security and economic interests. development assistance for health increased 4-fold from 1990 to 2007, from $5.6 billion to $21.8 billion per year. this represents a change from previous decades, which were characterized by low, stagnant levels of health assistance (26) Efforts to fight HIV/AIDS received most of the increased development assistance for health. aid for international influenza surveillance and pandemic planning and response programs was virtually nonexistent prior to the emergence of the H5N1 avian influenza virus. more than $2 billion was provided to combat the disease between 2004 and 2008. other development assistance for health efforts is linked in a more indirect fashion to foreign policy and national security goals. foreign policy's powerful influence on development assistance for health leaves many pressing global health battles underresourced. development assistance for health increased 4-fold from 1990 to 2007 from $5.6 billion to $21.8 billion per year. this represents a change from previous decades, which were characterized by low, stagnant levels of health assistance (26) international resources for HIV/AIDS grew from $292 million in 1996 to over $10 billion in 2007, quadrupling from 2001 to 2007 alone (28, 29) by 2007 it constituted 47% of all development assistance for health (30) the growth in US development assistance for health increased an impressive 208% between 2001 and 2007. the president's emergency plan for AIDS Relief has been touted as promoting positive views of the united states on the african continent (41, 42) foreign-policy extensions of domestic political priorities have also shaped development assistance for health. the relationship between trade and health forms part of a long history of commercial exchange between human societies. trade dates from the 19th century BC through the extension of trade to India and China along the Silk Road and the expansion of trade by sea from the 15th century onward. as trade has evolved in geographic reach, scale, mode, and type of commodity, so too have the human health implications. insufficient regulation of blood products led to inadvertent trade-facilitated transmission of HIV/AIDS and hepatitis C (55). a key issue in the trade of health-related goods is the health impact of standardizing patent rights under the agreement on trade-related intellectual property rights (TRIPS) despite concerns that patent-protected drugs would be too expensive for the world's poor. trade of health services is categorized under 4 modes: cross-border delivery of samples or services, consumption of health services abroad, establishment of health facilities by a foreign-based concern. there is a general trend towards increased trade in health services (67, 68) risks concern distributive consequences for domestic patients and the possible \u201cbrain drain\u201d of health professionals from resource-scarce countries. there has historically been friction between trade and health concerns, implying a need for greater coherence between trade and health policy. there has historically been friction between trade and health concerns, implying a need for greater coherence between trade and health policy. despite the World Trade Organization's claim that the Doha Declaration removed the \u201cfinal patent obstacle to cheap drug imports\u201d (58, p. 1), the limited capacity of developing states to actually implement the available flexibilities. public health advocates argue that trade in goods with the potential to harm should be restricted and that such goods should not be included in trade liberalization efforts. trade of food has received particular attention, especially with regard to issues such as access to an appropriate quantity (under- and overnutrition) and quality of food. the regulatory framework for trade of food is focused on the world trade organization's agreement on the application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary measures. diplomacy has traditionally focused on dialogue and negotiating alliances, treaties, and other agreements. but recent usage of the term \"health diplomacy\" has encompassed not only international agreements on health, but also efforts to promote the role of global health in foreign policy. countries sought to meet after acknowledging that the faster movement of people by rail and ship was facilitating the spread of disease. despite this apparent victory of global health over narrow state interests, a number of countries have argued that the IHRs actually undervalue \u201cequity between developed and developing nations\u201d some argue that the IHRs undervalue \u201cequity between developed and developing nations\u201d and risk fragmentation of poor countries\u2019 health systems. a number of global health practitioners have advocated and enacted policies seeking to apply diplomacy in the service of global health aims. a number of global health practitioners have advocated and enacted policies seeking to apply diplomacy in the service of global health aims. health as a foreign policy issue needs a stronger strategic focus on the international agenda. the director general of the WHO writes that \"we need to embed the use of the health lens in foreign policy while we have this chance\" the united kingdom and Switzerland have enacted national strategies attempting to establish \"policy coherence\" between their global health and foreign policies. diplomacy has been used to craft international agreements to improve global health. state interests have been critical to either the success or obstruction of such agreements. the origin of modern health diplomacy can be traced to 1851, when the first international Sanitary Conference met to discuss cooperation on cholera, plague, and yellow fever (82). the 2002\u20132003 epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (83) generated the political momentum necessary to complete the IHR revision process. countries gave the WHO a novel ability to intrude upon state interests. despite this apparent victory of global health over narrow state interests, a number of countries have argued that the IHRs actually undervalue \u201cequity between developed and developing nations\u201d a number of global health practitioners have advocated and enacted policies seeking to apply diplomacy in the service of global health. a number of global health practitioners have advocated and enacted policies seeking to apply diplomacy in the service of global health. health as a foreign policy issue needs a stronger strategic focus on the international agenda. a number of middle-income countries, including Brazil (98), Thailand (99) and Indonesia (86), also highlight global health in their diplomacy. the instrumental use of health for foreign policy is not all diplomacy on health. the united states is not alone in using health interventions to serve foreign-policy objectives. other related attempts have been termed vaccine (104), science (105, 106), and disaster (107, 108) diplomacy. such efforts may ultimately be \u201cself-defeating,\u201d as ingram observes. the close association between public health and national security was broken in the 20th century by decolonization, improved sanitation, and the introduction of vaccines and antibiotics. by the 1990s, perceptions of increased vulnerability to infectious disease threats brought infectious diseases back onto national security agendas. acute infectious disease threats and bioterrorism have dominated recent national security discussions of global health. the benefits of linking global health to national security include high levels of political attention and funding. but the benefits of linking global health to national security have not come without criticism or costs. the evidence used to frame the disease as a national security threat has been shown to be inaccurate (136\u2013140) linkage of the disease to national security agendas may have contributed to the possibly disproportionate focus on the pandemic in national aid budgets. the public health community has sought to implement \u201chealth as a bridge to peace\u201d. health interventions are not neutral or designed as a bridge to peace. they are used to gain support of local populations through the offering or denial of health services. prioritization of health issues as national security threats can generate political attention and funding. the cost of framing international cooperation on epidemic diseases in security terms is becoming apparent. a linkage of the disease to national security agendas may have contributed to the possibly disproportionate focus on the pandemic in national aid budgets. critics say such efforts have \"never yielded a tangible peace benefit\" critics say such efforts have been driven more by \"ideology\" than evidence of effectiveness. interests can be economic (protecting trade), diplomatic (preventing epidemics), strategic (preventing bioterrorism) or (often) combinations of these interests. global health has affected the practice of foreign policy on occasions when global health and foreign-policy interests align. self-serving motives for state action on health do not have to lead to poor outcomes."}
