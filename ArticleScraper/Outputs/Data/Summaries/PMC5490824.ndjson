{"summary": "the highly mutable, enveloped, RNA virus was discovered nearly 30 years ago. there is still no reproducible immunological intervention that develops a broadly protective immune response against virulent PRRSV. PRRS disease was first described on farms in north Carolina in the USA at the end of the 1980s. PRRSV has a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome of approximately 15 kb designated to the Arteriviridae family. the virus encodes at least 10 functional ORFs. ORF1a and 1b encode two large polyproteins cleave into 14 non-structural proteins. macrophages and dendritic cells are common members of the mononuclear phagocyte system that plays a varied, and important role in many aspects of tissue remodeling, development, immunity and immunopathology. if a pathogen is able to infect and destroy, manipulate, or maintain itself within macrophages or dendritic cells, it then has the potential to modulate the immune response into a favorable situation for its own replication and survival. the ability of PRRSV to subvert the immune system has not been investigated as extensively as more prominent pathogens of humans, such as HIV. the ability of PRRSV to subvert the immune system has not been investigated as extensively as more prominent pathogens of humans, such as HIV. the presence and significance of this mechanism in PRRSV pathogenesis has yet to be fully elucidated. future studies are needed to determine if this process operates in naturally permissive macrophages and dendritic cells. if it can be interrupted, for example by intracellular antibodies, and what effect it might have on viral propagation. Treg suppressive properties were discovered when thymectomized or Treg-depleted mice succumbed to autoimmune reactions. studies in PRRSV infections give an ambiguous picture about the role of Tregs. the only exception was in weaned pigs infected with a virulent virus. secondary infections following PRRS disease outbreak in swine herds are an alternative indicator of immunosuppression. an early study showed concurrent pulmonary bacterial infections in 58% of 221 PRRS cases. but the study did not determine if bacterial infections were present before the PRRS outbreaks. ized immunosuppression does not appear to be a key feature of PRRSV pathogenesis. the effects of PRRSV infection on adaptive immune response are less well characterized. the interaction of PRRSV with pigs does not appear to retard or attenuate development of humoral immunity or B cell differentiation. PRRSV has mechanisms of immune avoidance that are not present in viruses such as influenza virus and foot and mouth disease virus. some type of PRRSV-specific T cell interference is present, whereas specific B cell inhibition or immunosuppression are not immunological hallmarks of PRRSV infection. a variant PRRSV genetically different enough from the inoculating strain to evade the immune system, propagate, and then cause disease has been coveted by immunologists and practitioners. this immune capability has only been found in a proportion of animals in groups of similar genetics age, sex, and exposure history [9], but only in a proportion of animals. cross-neutralization was reported in animals exposed first to a PRRSV vaccine strain followed by homologous or heterologous virus challenge. viremia, up to 42 days, was linked with increased breadth of neutralizing antibodies following a single viral infection. PRRSV on the herd level has evaded the swine health industry since the emergence of PRRSV. there are multiple proposed mechanisms by which PRRSV may evade or inhibit the development or effectiveness of a neutralizing antibody response. the key to adapting the immune phenomenon of some animals lies in identifying conserved epitopes on surface proteins which are necessary for infection. new research on other pathogens has shown that non-neutralizing antibodies may play a much larger role in immunity than was previously appreciated [128,129,130,131] alternative antibody functions, such as antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody-dependent complement-mediated cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent complement-mediated virolysis may be important in the clearance of virus and virally infected cells from an animal. anti-swine IgM response is specific for the inoculating virus with partial neutralizing activity against heterologous viruses. the effectiveness of immunoglobulins in protecting against infection was evaluated with passive transfer studies. these experiments showed the effectiveness of neutralizing antibodies at preventing clinical infection and disease against homologous challenge. a strong neutralizing antibody response would require both B cells and T cells capable of recognizing neutralizing epitopes. cross-neutralization was reported in animals exposed first to a PRRSV vaccine strain followed by homologous or heterologous virus challenge. antibody resistance has evaded the swine health industry since the emergence of PRRSV. there are multiple proposed mechanisms by which PRRSV may evade or inhibit the development of a neutralizing antibody response. the key to adapting the immune phenomenon of some animals lies in identifying conserved epitopes on surface proteins which are necessary for infection. pig is sufficient to render animals non-susceptible to PRRSV infection and replication. it is proposed that after endocytosis, CD163 associates with the virus within the endosome, resulting in uncoating of the virus and the release of the viral genome into the cellular cytoplasm. PRRSV infection results in lymphocyte apoptosis and immune impairment. it has been suggested that PRRSV largely or exclusively induces a specific humoral response to infection [51,134] affinity matured B cells then leave the germinal center as either IgG+ plasma cells or IgG+ memory cells. affinity matured B cells then leave the germinal center as either IgG+ plasma cells or IgG+ memory cells. these cells constitute the first two lines of defense against reinfection. there is scant research on the memory B cell response to PRRSV. the specific memory B cells are abundant in tonsil, lymph nodes draining the lungs and reproductive tract, and spleen. the key to understanding the broadly neutralizing response lies within circulating or lymphoid organ resident memory B cells. arrow has been long considered as the reservoir for long-lived plasma cells in both mice and humans. pigs may not have long-lived plasma cells, as the half-life of porcine antibodies in serum is, on average, approximately nine days. arrow has been long considered as the reservoir for long-lived plasma cells. pigs may have long-lived plasma cells and, if so, where do they reside. it seems unlikely that pigs do not have long-lived plasma cells. the half-life of porcine antibodies in serum is, on average, approximately nine days. the change in this ratio could have been due to a temporary loss of CD4+ cells through apoptosis or an increase in CD8+ cells due to antigen-specific proliferation. the importance of these findings for clearance of PRRSV or protection from infection were not known at the time. the importance of this T cell subset in the context of PRRSV infection has recently been investigated. a strain of Chinese highly pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) appeared to suppress Th17 cells in the peripheral blood and lungs of pigs, resulting in an increased susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections. the effect was PRRSV strain-specific, as a non-HP PRRSV strain failed to elicit the same response. PRRSV appears to suppress the NK cell response without significantly affecting NK cell numbers. the cause of this suppression has yet to be determined, although viral proteins, rather than soluble factors from cells, may be responsible. the cause of this suppression has yet to be determined, although viral proteins may be responsible. the study of mature animals, which have cleared the virus, may provide the key to understanding how the immune system eventually gets the upper hand on the virus. the continued development of antigen-specific reagents, of high sensitivity and specificity, is needed for understanding how the host responds to PRRSV infection."}
