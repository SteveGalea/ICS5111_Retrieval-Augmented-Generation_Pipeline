{"summary": "genetic RNA recombination contributes to viral evolution and biogenesis. recombination allows for exchange of sequence blocks and thus generate mosaicism in viral RNA genomes. there have been reports of diverse mosaic patterns in retroviruses. RNA recombination is important for the evolutionary radiation of Bromoviridae, the tripartite RNA viruses. both viral RNA sequences and viral and host proteins do contribute to BMV RNA recombination. seedlings of three different plant species, as well as the barley protoplast cells, were co-infected with F/R BMV mixtures. the recombinant RNA segments were cloned and sequenced. the recombinant RNA segments were cloned and sequenced. 106 cells were transfected with 1\u20133 g of mixtures of F and R virion RNAs. the transfected protoplasts were incubated overnight in darkness at 27 \u00b0C in a shaker at 25 rpm. blots were probed with radioactive 3\u2032-probe. the intensity of bands was quantified densitometrically. the cDNA templates were copied and amplified by RT-polymerase chain reaction. the insert-carrying clones were sequenced using the Sanger protocol. RT-PCR was performed on RNA3 sequences directly from a mixture of F and R virion BMV RNAs. another control involved co-transfecting the protoplasts with mixtures of F and R BMV RNAs 1 and 3 only. strain is 2,867 nt long, contains 61 nt differences and a 2 nt insertion. the F sequence is 2,114 nt, while the R RNA3 sequence is 2,111 nt. a few sites that were polymorphic in the GenBank sequences proved to be monomorphic in our hands. combination frequency per nucleotide (RFN) was calculated for each RNA fragment (interval) between markers. the number of recombinants observed in this interval was divided by the number of sequenced clones (per cloning experiment) and the number of nucleotides (the length) in that fragment multiplied by 100. barley (Hordeum vulgare), Chenopodium quinoa, and Nicotiana benthamiana were used as the BMV hosts. for each experiment, barley seedlings were inoculated five to 6 days after planting. all plants were grown in a greenhouse with full-light condition, 25 \u00b0C. blotting was used to assess the quality of BMV RNA and the accumulation level of F and R RNAs. total RNA (1 l) was extracted from 50 mg of combined leaf tissue. blots were probed with radioactive 3\u2032-probe, as described by us before. PCR-generated cDNA products were cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) the insert-carrying clones were sequenced using the Sanger protocol. twenty-five clones (of RNA3 in first control, and of RNA3 or RNA1 in the second control) were sequenced using the Sanger protocol. none revealed the F x R crossovers. the sequences of the cloned cDNAs were compared to the following GenBank sequences. some ambiguities, as well as nucleotides that did not match either F or R, were noted in the regions of overlap between different sequencing run. most of these ambiguities were resolved by examining the aligned sequences manually; the remaining ambiguous sites were resolved in favor of the higher quality sequence. two to three seedlings were mechanically inoculated with leaf sap. the viral RNA concentration was estimated with Northern blotting in the total RNA extracted 10 days postinoculation. cDNA products for RNA2 were digested with Mlu I or PvuI. recombination of BMV RNAs in whole plants. the progeny viral RNA was extracted from co-infected plants. the individual RNA components were cloned as cDNA. the clones were sequenced in both directions. the RFN values were calculated as described in the text and their numbers plotted between the markers with the color-coded lines. the values reflect the probability (percentage) of crossovers per nucleotide at the particular region. boxed regions represent the two functional domains of the 1a protein: the NTPase and the helicase domains. cDNA clones covering the shorter fragment of RNA1 represented the wt (un-recombined) sequence, showing a dominance of the F strain. eighteen clones were the recombinant ones, corresponding to an RF of 27%. six recombination hot spots were altered with the regions of lower activity. the calculated Pearson correlation coefficients showed low statistical linear relationships and high P values when pairwise comparisons were done between pairs of the sets of RFN values.

RNA2 recombined in a similar way in both hosts. regions between the hot spots were less active, again located at similar positions for both hosts. 3 generated two double-cross and one triple-cross recombinants. in un-recombined clones from barley, the R BMV sequences dominated for Fragment 1 (thirty-six of fifty clones), Fragment 2 (thirty-six of fifty clones), and Fragment 3 (forty-two of forty-nine clones) both strains were represented approximately equally. mapped RNA3 sequences responsible for CP binding (PE site and B-box site) are marked with purple bars below. the separately sequenced areas of cDNA clones are depicted with dashed lines below. 3.3 Recombination in protoplasts To test recombination with reduced selection pressure, the co-infection experiment was performed in a single cell protoplast system. barley protoplasts have been used in the past to study BMV RNA replication. hot spot Ia (nts 340\u2013484) was much more active in barley protoplasts than in whole plants. both hot spots Ia and V disappeared for the 3F to 1R inoculum ratio. also, the RF increased to 36% with the 3F to 1R ratio. a central portion of the CP ORF (nts 1350\u20131598) did not support recombination with any of the three F to R ratios in protoplasts or in whole barley plants. a central portion of the CP ORF (nts 1350\u20131598) did not support recombination with any of the three F to R ratios in protoplasts or in whole barley plants. two to three seedlings were mechanically inoculated with leaf sap. the viral RNA concentration was estimated with Northern blotting in the total RNA extracted 10 days postinoculation. no apparent differences in viral RNA concentration between F- and R-infected N. benthamiana or barley systemic hosts. seventy-one clones of Fragment 1 and sixty-eight clones of Fragment 2 were sequenced, demonstrating 8 per cent and 3 per cent of recombinants. the entire recombination frequency (RF) defined as the ratio of recombinant clones to the total number of sequenced clones equaled 11 per cent. the RFN values for Ch. quinoa are denoted by green lines, N. benthamiana\u2014by red lines, and for barley\u2014by blue lines. boxed regions represent the two functional domains of the 1a protein: the NTPase and the helicase domains. the sequenced areas are represented by dashed lines. twenty-one F clones and twelve R clones represented the wt (un-recombined) sequence, showing a dominance of the F strain. eighteen clones were the recombinant ones, corresponding to an RF of 27%. six recombination hot spots were altered with the regions of lower activity. the calculated Pearson correlation coefficients showed low statistical linear relationships and high P values when pairwise comparisons were done between pairs of the sets of RFN values.

RNA2 recombined in a similar way in both hosts. regions between hot spots were less active, again located at similar positions. in un-recombined clones from barley, the R BMV sequences dominated for Fragment 1 (thirty-six of fifty clones), Fragment 2 (thirty-six of fifty clones), and Fragment 3 (forty-two of forty-nine clones) among un-recombined clones from N. benthamiana (Supplementary Fig. S2), both strains were represented approximately the mapped RNA3 sequences responsible for CP binding (PE site and B-box site) are marked with purple bars below. the separately sequenced areas of cDNA clones are depicted with dashed lines below. RNA3 data from N. benthamiana and C. quinoa are required to calculate the statistical pairwise linear correlations among the three hosts. the co-infection experiment was performed in a single cell protoplast system. barley protoplasts have been used in the past to study RNA replication. hot spots Ia (nts 340\u2013484) disappeared for the 3F to 1R inoculum ratio (yellow lines) also, the RF increased to 36% with the 3F to 1R ratio (yellow lines) hot spots I\u2013V, including the 3a ORF, the intercistronic region, and a short region at the N-side of the CP ORF. however, there were significant differences at hot spots II, III, and IV. at the intercistronic region (hot spot III), the 1F to 1R ratio (blue line) supported the highest RFN, whereas the 3F to 1R ratio had the lowest RFN. our data confirm the existence of previously reported recombination sites. the error bars were large for RFNs in most of the recombination hot spots. this was due to a limited number of cloned recombinants. recombination sites were generally similar in barley plants and barley protoplasts, again with strong statistical correlations. recombination sites were generally similar in barley plants and barley protoplasts, again with strong statistical correlations. one large portion of the CP ORF represented a low crossover frequency region in RNA3 in both barley plants and protoplasts. if yes, then the RNA folding complexity would not be the sole determinant of the crossover frequency. both host and viral factors may contribute to recombination activity at the hot spots. heterologous crossovers can generate a significant degree of mosaicism in the BMV genome. the rate of homologous exchanges reaching 0.1 per cent per nucleotide. the high precision was also reported in the CMV/TAV recombination system. extensive crosses between two ORFs in RNA3 were also reported in natural strains of CMV. such exchanges can reduce stochastic degradation of already fit RNA populations."}
