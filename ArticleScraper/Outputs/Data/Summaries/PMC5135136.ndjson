{"summary": "the project aimed to rectify excessive and premature specialization in the training system of resident doctors. the project aimed to gradually rectify excessive and premature specialization in the training system of resident doctors. there have recently been calls for establishing a core competence-oriented training system for resident doctors. the flipped classroom is a new teaching method that has attracted the attention of educators worldwide. the core concept of the flipped classroom is to \u201cflip\u201d the teaching model. it aims to change the traditional teaching model, in which \u201cteachers teach the content of the curriculum while students discuss and practice after lessons and then complete assignments\u201d the theory of reasoned action was considered to design the study\u2019s theoretical foundation. the theory of reasoned action, developed by Fishbein and Ajzen in 1967, enables the prediction of individual behaviors, attitudes, and intentions. theory of reasoned action maintains that behavioral intention will be influenced by \u201cattitude\u201d and \u201csubjective norms\u201d. when an individual\u2019s attitude toward behavior is more positive, his behavioral intention will be higher and when his attitude toward behavior is more negative, his behavioral intention will be lower. if an individual believes that he/she should perform a certain behavior, this behavior will occur. the questionnaire included basic information on behavioral intention, attitude, subjective norms, behavior belief, outcome evaluation, motivation to comply, normative belief, self-efficacy, and external variables. we revised the first draft of the questionnaire based on the experts\u2019 comments. forty participants took the test, with 35 valid questionnaires being collected. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS for Windows. Cronbach\u2019s and Kuder-Richardson reliability were used to test all sub-scales and their reliability, which ranged between 0.6579 and 0.8689. in terms of the distribution of divisions in the experimental and control groups, the number of students from general medicine was 8 and 9, respectively; from general surgery, 8 and 8, respectively; and from other divisions, 23 and 26, respectively. no statistically significant difference was noted in Table 3. self-efficacy had the greatest influence on behavioral intention. the effects of attitude and subjective norms on behavioral intention were identical. the study supports the theory of reasoned action: students\u2019 attitudes and subjective norms. the effect can be enhanced if self-efficacy is added to attitude and subjective norms. the effect can be further enhanced if self-efficacy is added to attitude and subjective norms. the flipped classroom model has been used in different areas of teaching. the flipped classroom is being implemented as a result of its timely ride on the popularity of online e-teaching, especially the effect of massive open online courses. the flipped classroom is highly valued and has been practiced by teachers in schools of various levels, but very few attempts have been made until now to report the learning outcomes achieved through the flipped classroom. self-efficacy refers to an individual\u2019s belief in his/her ability to perform a specific behavior in a specific situation. it can serve as a predictive variable when explaining the individual\u2019s extent of behavior. the source of this predictive variable varies in its performance level and strength according to the variables of cognition, sociality, and environments, thus resulting in different behavioral outcomes. study confirms that it is possible to include self-efficacy in the theory of reasoned action to explain changes in behavioral intention with respect ot participation in the core curriculum training through the flipped classroom. teachers can see the growth of their students as they become more independent in their learning, show stronger motivation and more responsibility for their own learning. the core duty of the flipped classroom is developing a student-centered teaching method. the core duty of the flipped classroom is developing a student-centered teaching method, thus the students will control and possess their own learning. a limitation of this study was the scope of the intervention."}
