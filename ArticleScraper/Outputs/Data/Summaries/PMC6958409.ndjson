{"summary": "the virus has not been eradicated ninety years after it was identified. 3\u20135 million people are still affected annually with severe symptoms and 500,000 die. virulent strains still appear and result in local epidemics or global pandemics. models such as single-cell organisms (yeast) and invertebrates appear to be not legitimate for studying a human-infecting virus. some of these advantages are unique to these systems and are derived from the fact that they are lower organisms in the evolutionary tree and consequently much simpler relative to mammals. influenza viruses are negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses that cause respiratory diseases. the most prolific member is Influenza A, which infects a large number of hosts. its genome is composed of symmetrical helixes in eight segments. viral HA binds to sialic acids on the cell surface membrane. the acidification within the endosome induces the viral envelope to fuse with the endosome. the fusion releases viral contents, which are the genetic material in form of vRNPs. the emergence of resistant virus strains has rendered M2 inhibitors useless. there is also growing resistance against NA inhibitors such as the H274Y mutation found in the 2009 H1N1 strain that made the virus oseltamivir-resistant. there is an obvious fitness cost to viruses holding NA resistance. vaccine strain is selected for high growth properties and contains HA and NA derived from the circulating strain. the selected strain is then amplified in eggs and the virus is harvested and inactivated. a serious disadvantage of the method is that the virus can become mismatched due to viral adaptation to egg culture. the fact that influenza still prevails demonstrates, unambiguously and painfully, that these drugs and vaccines are not as efficient as the vaccination and therapies of other diseases. many of these advantages are unique to these systems and are derived from the fact that they are lower organisms in the evolutionary tree and consequently much simpler relative to mammals. the need for genetic screens and other large-scale approaches is essential to identify the numerous effects of the virus on host systems. the relevance of such cells is obvious and they may replace some of the many studies that use cell lines of dogs and mice. a further advantage of using primary human tissue cultures is that they can be isolated from patients. influenza A virus can be further classified into different subtypes based on their HA and NA glycoproteins. of the 18 haemagglutinin and 11 neuraminidase subtypes known today, only the H1, H2, H3, N1 and N2 subtypes have caused epidemics in humans. severe influenza may result in complications such as acute bronchitis and secondary bacterial pneumonia [21]. virulent strains may appear and result in local epidemics or global pandemics such as the 1918 H1N1 Spanish pandemic, 2005 H5N1 Bird flu and 2009 H1N1 Swine flu [3]. emergence of resistant virus strains has rendered M2 inhibitors useless and there is also growing resistance against NA inhibitors. naphthalimides is a class of compounds that antagonize NS1. this class of compounds has yet to undergo future development and reach clinical trials. pandemics and epidemics still appear when the vaccine is mismatched with the predominant antigenic strains. no Current Laboratory Model Has Fully Reproduced All Aspects of Human Viral Infection. rodents, including mice, hamsters, cotton rats and guinea pigs, became widely used. rodents, including mice, hamsters, cotton rats and guinea pigs, became widely used. mice may not be the ideal model for studying influenza due to differences in disease pathogenesis and limited infective viral strains. in some monkeys, while the virus does replicate in pulmonary cells, seasonal strains do not cause pathogenic symptoms. there is no optimal animal model system that manifests all aspects of the human disease. the most widely used, MDCK and the immortal lung-derived cell lines A549 and Calu-3, HEK293 and Vero cells, are described below. the most widely used, MDCK and the immortal lung-derived cell lines A549 and Calu-3, HEK293 and vero cells are described below. MDCK cells have been used in almost 1000 papers to produce influenza vaccines [57,58,59], study virus pathogenesis and replication kinetics and evaluate the efficacy of anti-viral drugs. compound T-705 inhibited plaque formation in MDCK cells even up to 72 hours post infection (hpi with A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1)) both HEK293 and Vero cells are being studied for basic research regarding influenza. mice, ferrets, guinea pigs, swine and non-human primates are commonly used to study influenza. mice are widely used because of its low cost, small size and ease of husbandry. ferrets rank among the best animal models of influenza. the lung physiology of the ferret is highly similar to that of humans. the virus transmits easily among ferrets [88], recapitulating virus spread in humans. pigs have similar tracheobronchial structure, lung physiology and size to humans. the immune system of pigs is also similar to that of humans. limitations of such a model are the cost of husbandry and space needed to house the animals compared to mice. mice may not be the ideal model for studying influenza due to differences in disease pathogenesis and limited infective viral strains. in some monkeys, while the virus replicates in pulmonary cells, seasonal strains do not cause pathogenic symptoms unless highly virulent viral strains are used. the study of the biochemistry of each viral protein could be advanced through the use of the alternative models discussed in the review. the most widely used, MDCK and the immortal lung-derived cell lines A549 and Calu-3, HEK293 and Vero cells are described below. several MDCK derivatives have been developed to study influenza in vitro. a recent example for the usefulness of MDCK cells is the study of compound T-705. compound inhibited viral growth at MOIs of 0.0001 to 1. HEK293 and Vero Cells HEK293 cells are epithelial cells derived from embryonic kidney. they were exposed to sheared fragments of adenovirus DNA. they are widely used for protein expression studies due to ease of transfection into these cells. MDCK cells have been used in almost 1000 papers to produce influenza vaccines [57,58,59], study virus pathogenesis and replication kinetics and evaluate the efficacy of anti-viral drugs [60,61] compound T-705 inhibited plaque formation in MDCK cells even up to 72 hours post infection (hpi with A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1)) epithelial cells derived from embryonic kidney were exposed to sheared fragments of adenovirus DNA. both HEK293 and Vero cells are being studied for basic research regarding influenza as well as for vaccine research. mice, ferrets, guinea pigs, swine and non-human primates are commonly used to study influenza. ferrets rank among the best animal models of influenza. the lung physiology of the ferret is highly similar to that of humans. the virus transmits easily among ferrets [88], recapitulating virus spread in humans. mouse is widely used because of its low cost, small size and ease of husbandry. many inbred laboratory mice are not susceptible to influenza because they express the antiviral protein Mx1. ferrets rank among the best animal models of influenza. the lung physiology of the ferret is highly similar to that of humans. the virus transmits easily among ferrets [88]. novel, alternative models for studying influenza. mammalian models, animals and cell lines, are obviously biologically relevant for influenza studies but do possess serious limitations. this is due to similarities to humans in terms of genetics, anatomy, physiology and social behavior. yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) and Scizosacchromyces pombe (S. pombe) have been model organisms for studying all the basic cellular processes in the eukaryotic cell. important processes, such as cell cycle, autophagy, regulation of chemical energy (ATP), basic signaling pathways (e.g., MAP kinase cascades) and vesicle trafficking, were first yeast cells have been used to reconstitute enzymatic complexes and biochemical pathways such as Ras and its regulators, MAP kinases, GCN2/PKR and even the olfactory pathway from the taste receptor to the activated enzyme. some of them are not available yet in any other model organism. recombinant HA was found to be effective in eliciting a high immune response in mice. a common approach is expressing the viral proteins in yeast and thus studying the properties of single viral proteins in an isolated in vivo environment. use of a reversible M2 channel inhibitor, BL-1743, caused an increase in transmembrane proton flux due to the re-establishment of the proton gradient by M2. 24 mutants appear relevant to mammalian systems as they caused a reduced antiviral shutoff activity when tested in mammalian cells. the yeast system was used together with MDCK cells to test the efficacy and toxicity of synthesized arylsulfonamide compounds. one of the derivatives, termed compound 63, was found to inhibit the native M2 and, importantly, also S31N- and V27A-mutated M2 protein, which are amantadine-resistant mutants. researchers used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify host interactors of individual viral proteins. these include NS1 [144,145,146,147,148,149,150,151,152,153,154,155,156,157,158], NS2 [129,144,159,160,161], NP [162,163,164,165,166,167,168], PA [169,170,171,172], PB1 [173], 174, NA the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster (Drosophila) is a multicellular organism. it has served as a model for studying intracellular processes. it is highly permissive to genetic manipulations, convenient and cheap to handle in the laboratory. the concept of \u2018tumor suppressors\u2019 and the discovery of the first \u2018recessive oncogene\u2019 were established in Drosophila. a common approach has been the expression of a viral protein in a particular organ of the fly and following the physiological, phenotypic or pathological effects. RNAs and antiviral-induced autophagy were major findings obtained through studying viruses in the fly. the influenza M2 was expressed in the wing and the eye, causing wing defects and a total loss of eye tissue. males were found to have a more severe phenotype than females. NS1 functions as a RNA silencing suppressor through its N-terminal dsRNA-binding domain. it was shown that a single D92E mutation in NS1 increased rescue efficiency of pFR1-B2 compared to WT A/NS1. NS1 expression caused an increase of distance between wing veins. unbiased mutagenesis screen provided a new NS1 mutation, A122V, located in the effector domain, which reduced the NS1-induced wing phenotype. different Hh modulation among various viral strains exists (Udorn, swine flu and PR8), with the PR8-A122V strain having the highest Hh modulation activity. the zebrafish (Danio rerio) belongs to the Cyprinidae family, the same family as the carp and the goldfish. it is a model of choice that bridges the gap between lower animals and mammals. the zebrafish has a fully developed immune system. interaction studies have been performed in adult zebrafish for other viral infections such as chikungunya [238], herpes simplex virus 1 [239] and hepatitis C [240,241]. zebrafish embryos were reported to have 2,6-linked sialic acids, which enables the virus to enter and infect the embryos. infected zebrafish have severe muscle degeneration in almost every muscle segment, with increased mortality at 4 and 5 dpi compared to the PBS injected mutant zebrafish. established cell lines possess major disadvantages, including pro-inflammatory innate immune signaling cascades. primary cultures provide both the convenience of studies in culture and the advantage of cells that have not re-wired their biochemical networks. these patient-derived cells may come with known patients\u2019 characteristics such as gender, co-morbidities, or lifestyle habits like smoking, allowing a personalized investigation of the disease. human viruses infect non-ciliated cells while avian ones infect ciliated cells (tracheo-bronchial epithelial cells) low levels of viral replication was observed in alveolar type I cells (ATI) compared to normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) and nasopharyngeal epithelial (NPE) cells. eotaxin (eosinophil-specific chemoattractant) was found to be increased and released into the supernatant. these cells were found to generate intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and had increased expression of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidases (Nox) [256]. infected hNECs were found to elicit similar immune responses to other known models. h3N2 infection resulted in increased expression of oncostatin M (OSM) and upregulation of miRNAs. NHBE cells were compared with MDCK cells and NHBE cells were found to have better correlative data in terms of replication abilities of live attenuated viruses isolated from different strains. the conjugated NY312-AF594 virus (A/NY/312/01) was shown to have similar binding patterns in NHBE cells as to those observed with human respiratory tissues. NHBE cells shown to have lower conductance of the chloride ion channel cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) this may be due to the virus targeting the CFTR for early lysosomal degradation and affecting ion transport in the host. HA mutations were also studied in relation with neuraminidase inhibitor resistance. NHBE cells are being used for translation of culture tests to clinical uses. the results were confirmed in bronchial explants obtained from the same patients. the combination of TVB024 and oseltamivir reduced viral shedding. this was more effective than oseltamivir alone in inhibiting epithelial infection. olar Type I cells (ATIs) are required for the gas-exchange surface in the alveoli [287] alveolar type II cells synthesize and secrete pulmonary surfactant, secrete chemokines and cytokines. the viruses tested could only be found in type II but not in type I pneumocytes. ATII cells produced inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1 and RANTES. IL-29 was found to be the main cytokine produced by infected ATII cells. link between infection rates and obesity could have been monitored only in patients-derived primary cultures. the Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Scizosacchromyces pombe have been model organisms for studying all the basic cellular processes in the eukaryotic cell. most findings in yeast turned out to be relevant to all the basic biochemical, physiological, metabolic and genetic processes of the eukaryotic cell. s. cerevisiae cells have been used to reconstitute mammalian enzymatic complexes and biochemical pathways such as Ras and its regulators, MAP kinases, GCN2/PKR and even the olfactory pathway. some of them are not available yet in any other model organism. HA gene was expressed in P. pastoris and purified for mouse immunization. recombinant HA was found to be effective in eliciting a high immune response in mice. a common approach is expressing the viral proteins in yeast. yeast can also be used to study subcellular localization of the viral protein. expression of the M2 ion channel in yeast affected growth. a reversible M2 channel inhibitor, BL-1743, caused an increase in transmembrane proton flux due to the re-establishment of the proton gradient by M2. a spirothizamenthane compound was found to inhibit the native M2. a spirothizamenthane compound was used to synthesize derivatives thereof. the yeast system was used together with MDCK cells to test the efficacy and toxicity of synthesized arylsulfonamide compounds. analysis of Vps1 in yeast has revealed key aspects of the protein structure-function. yeast could also be used to establish the entire influenza replicon to study, in an isolated system, the transcription and replication of the viral genome. yeast can be used to identify and produce anti-influenza antibodies for vaccines and therapy [194] Unlike yeast, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster (Drosophila) is a multicellular organism. it is highly permissive to genetic manipulations, convenient and cheap to handle in the laboratory. genes that are defective in Alzheimer\u2019s disease (e.g., Amyloid ; Tau) are conserved in Drosophila. conservation of most processes responsible for metabolism, homeostasis, growth and development made it an excellent model for studying obesity, diabetes and aging. influenza M2 was expressed in the wing and the eye, causing wing defects. males were found to have a more severe phenotype than females. transgenic flies were used to screen for mutations in ion transport or pH homeostasis-related genes of the host. a cell-based screen was performed using Drosophila cells to identify new RNA silencing suppressors. the coding sequence of GFP was used in-frame with the start of B2 ORF of flock house virus (FHV) RNA1 to obtain pFR1gfp. this was based on previous observation that FHV B2 could inhibit the RNAi pathway in FHV infection. NS1 expression caused an increase of the distance between wing veins. several known mutations inserted into NS1 did not alter the Hh-modulating activity of NS1 in the fly\u2019s wing. unbiased mutagenesis screen provided a new NS1 mutation, A122V. 176 of the screened genes inhibited luciferase expression, as identified in two independent tests. a total of 176 of the screened genes inhibited luciferase expression, as identified in two independent tests. the use of the Drosophila system for the study of Viruses is not extensive yet, but is becoming more attractive. a common approach has been the expression of a viral protein in a particular organ of the fly and following the physiological, phenotypic or pathological effects. many studies in Drosophila cells in culture have revealed the mechanism of action of viral proteins. this approach was useful, for example, for proteins of Hepatitis B, HIV and West Nile viruses. some viruses were found capable of replication within the fly cells in culture or even within the whole fly. a cell-based screen was performed using Drosophila cells to identify new RNA silencing suppressors. the coding sequence of GFP was used in-frame with the start of FHV RNA1 to obtain pFR1gfp. this was based on the previous observation that FHV B2 could inhibit the RNA interference pathway in FHV infection. five different RNA silencing inhibitors (including NS1A) were expressed using the GAL4 inducible expression system. NS1 expression caused an increase of the distance between wing veins. NS1 expression caused an increase of the distance between wing veins. a modified virus, Flu-VSV-G, was designed to encode the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) glycoprotein G. 176 of the screened genes inhibited luciferase expression, as identified in two independent tests. the zebrafish has a fully developed immune system. it also enables genetic screens and real-time visualization. zebrafish can be used to study specific aspects of immunity development. 2 dpf zebrafish were infected with PR8 and muscle fiber damage was observed. a NS1-GFP virus showed that the virus infected skeletal muscles. this could be due to pro-inflammatory innate immune signaling cascades being induced. primary human tissue culture is a relevant model for influenza studies. the main cell lines used for studying influenza included the MDCK cells and cancer-derived lung cell lines such as A549 and Calu-3. primary culture provides both the convenience of studies in culture and the advantage of cells that have not rewired their biochemical networks. primary lung cells secret a class of proteases that can cleave influenza HA for viral entry. at ALI, the mucus readily forms about a week after air exposure. this forces the virus to travel laterally to the neighboring cell. this forces the virus to travel laterally to the neighboring cell. the viruses in the study were able to infect both ciliated and non-ciliated cells in bronchial tissue and type-II AECs. this may reflect the pathogenicity of H5N6 viruses to cause severe influenza in humans. smoking could have an effect on the interaction between epithelial cells and immune cells. the use of primary cultures is the only way in which responses of smokers and patients to influenza infection could have been tested. infected hNECs were found to elicit similar immune responses to other known models. primary NHBE cells are derived from patient biopsies at the most distal aspect of the trachea and carina. NHBE cells may provide further knowledge to influenza tropism, the host susceptibility to complications and response to the virus in the lower respiratory tract. NHBE cells predominantly display 2,6 linkage sialic acids receptors as well as 2,3 sialic acid receptors [269,270] reverse genetics-derived viruses carrying target mutations in NP and/or PB2 proteins have been used to better understand the effects of viral proteins in infection. proteomic studies performed with human NHBE infected in vitro have revealed signaling pathways which could be important. NHBE cells are also being used for immediate translation of culture tests to clinical uses. NHBE cells are also being used for immediate translation of culture tests to clinical uses. NHBE cells isolated from patients are a rich source of information in understanding what host factors affect influenza. they point at the viral factors which increase the virus\u2019 ability to infect and propagate in these cells, increasing the chance of viral bronchitis. NHBE cells are a valuable tool for personalized treatment of influenza patients. recombinant viruses of NY1682 with PB2-D701N were used to infect ATI cells. the PB2-D701N substitution has been shown to cause increased viral replication in mice and guinea pigs. different host processes in ATI-like or ATII cells can be elucidated in the context of influenza. eotaxin (eosinophil-specific chemoattractant) was found to be increased in normal tissue infected with influenza. eotaxin (eosinophil-specific chemoattractant) was found to be increased. these cells were found to generate intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and had increased expression of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidases (Dual oxidase 2). NECs derived from smokers expressed lower levels of anti-viral cytokine IFN- and increased pro-inflammatory cytokine IP-6. smoking appeared to reduce cytokine IP-10 expression and release from NECs. infection of hNECs has uncovered novel host signaling mechanisms. h3N2 infection of hNECs resulted in increased expression of oncostatin M (OSM) and upregulation of miRNAs. other interesting observations using patient-derived NECs include the effects of estrogenic compounds on NECs. NHBE cells were able to better model virus replication and infectivity in humans compared to MDCK cells. the conjugated NY312-AF594 virus (A/NY/312/01) was shown to have similar binding patterns in NHBE cells as to those observed with human respiratory tissues. NHBE cells have been used to provide a better understanding of the host response to influenza infection in the bronchial tissues. NHBE cells have been used to provide a better understanding of the host response to influenza in the bronchial tissues. infected NHBE cells were used as an ex vivo model to test DAS181 efficacy in removing sialic acid and inhibiting influenza infection. NHBE cells isolated from patients are a rich source of information in understanding what host factors affect influenza. they also point at the viral factors which increase the virus\u2019 ability to infect and propagate in these cells. ATI cells mimic ATI cells more than ATII cells. recombinant viruses of NY1682 with PB2-D701N were used to infect ATI cells. ATI cells produced inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1 and RANTES. the link between infection rates and obesity could have been monitored only in the patients-derived primary cultures. the link between infection rates and obesity could have been monitored only in the patients-derived primary cultures. the use of primary cultures, primarily with patient-derived cultures, is also of great value for personalized medicine and for understanding social and behavioral aspects of the disease. despite this understanding and in spite of the proven achievements, alternative models still remain underutilized. Easily manipulated with various molecular, cellular processes [10] Easy to culture Smaller genomes compared other eukaryotes Availability of genetic resources to study molecular mechanisms [11] Closer to humans as they are a vertebrate model Has fully developed immune system."}
