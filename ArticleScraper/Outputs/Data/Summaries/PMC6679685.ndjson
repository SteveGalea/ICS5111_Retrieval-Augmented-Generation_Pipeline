{"summary": "data were collected from adults hospitalized with avian influenza A(H7N9) infection during 2013\u20132017 in china. we compared clinical features and A(H7N9) shedding among patients with different NAI doses and combination therapies. the median age was 56 years, 71% were male, and 37% died. the subjects included in the study were patients with laboratory-confirmed A(H7N9) infection diagnosed from 1 April 2013 to 1 March 2017. the study subjects were expanded from the cohort of 288 hospitalized patients with pneumonia during April 2013\u2013March 2015. the electronic medical records of patients were sent to a data collection center in china. corticosteroid treatment was defined as administration of a dose equivalent to 25 mg of methylprednisolone per day during hospitalization [22]. Statistical Analysis Mean values and standard deviations or median values with interquartile range were used to describe continuous variables. oseltamivir was confirmed in all patients by testing respiratory specimens with a real-time reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay at the local laboratory of the Chinese center for disease control and prevention. a 2-tailed P value of.05 was considered significant. respiratory specimens with cycle threshold (Ct) values of 38 were considered positive for A(H7N9). those with Ct values of >38 were considered negative for A(H7N9). corticosteroid treatment was defined as administration of a dose equivalent to 25 mg of methylprednisolone per day during hospitalization. a total of 88 patients (18.4%) who tested positive for A(H7N9) RNA until death, and 390 (81.6%) had resolution of A(H7N9) shedding. we used Kaplan-Meier survival analysis to estimate the cumulative A(H7N9) RNA\u2013negativity rate. y 56 (45\u201366) Male sex 340 (71.1) Comorbidity Hypertension 158 (33.1) Diabetes 67 (14.0) COPD 20 (4.2) Chronic renal insufficiency 17 (3.6) Immunosuppressionb 7 (1.5) Severity score and laboratory finding on admission SOFA score 5 (3\u20136) White blood cell count, 109 cells/L 4.3 (2.9\u20136.9) Lymphocyte count, 109 lymphocytes/L 0.5 (0.3\u20130.7 the source of respiratory specimens was available in medical records for 244 patients (51%) for detection of the first negative A(H7N9) RNA test result. only 7 patients (1.8%) with real-time RT-PCR confirmed A(H7N9) RNA within 6 days, 42 (10.7%) tested negative within 10 days, and 286 (73.1%) tested negative within 20 days. median duration of A(H7N9) shedding detected in endotracheal aspirate specimens was 17 days (IQR, 13\u201321 days) median duration of A(H7N9) shedding detected in endotracheal aspirate specimens was similar to median duration of A(H7N9) shedding detected in nasopharyngeal swabs (17 days [IQR, 13\u201321 days]. oseltamivir (150 mg twice daily) with detectable A(H7N9) RNA, by day after onset of illness.
