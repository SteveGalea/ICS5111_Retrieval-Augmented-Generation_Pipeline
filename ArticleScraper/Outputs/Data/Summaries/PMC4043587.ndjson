{"summary": "RA is the most common type of inflammatory arthritis, affecting between 0.5 and 1% of the population worldwide. the primary inflammatory site in RA is the synovium. the proliferation of synovial fibroblasts is considered to be necessary for the initiation and long-term progression of joint destruction. Sodium houttuyfonate (SH), an addition compound of sodium bisulfite and houttuynia, is the stable form of houttuynia. it has previously been used for the treatment of cationic bovine serum albumin-induced membranous glomerulonephritis in BALB/c mice. the tissue was placed in 25 cm2 culture bottles containing 2 ml RPMI-1640 nutrient solution in 10% FBS and 2 ml 0.4% type II collagenase. unattached cells were then transferred into centrifuge tubes and centrifuged for 10 min. a total of 4 ml 0.25% trypsin was added and the cells were incubated for 30 min. three control wells containing medium only were used as an absorbance reference. the cells were then incubated for 24 h. a total of 10 l MTT reagent (0.25% MTT) was added to each well. a total of 100 l detergent reagent was added to each well. the tissue was placed in 25 cm2 culture bottles containing 2 ml RPMI-1640 nutrient solution in 10% FBS and 2 ml 0.4% type II collagenase. unattached cells were then transferred into centrifuge tubes and centrifuged for 30 min. the cells were then incubated as aforementioned for 24 h. dilutions of cells in the culture medium between 106 and 103 cells/ml were prepared. a total of 100 l each dilution was analyzed in triplicate. a total of 10 l reagent (0.25% MTT) was added to each well. the cells were treated with 25, 50, 100 and 200 g/ml SH. the correlative coefficient was found to be 0.961718. 0.05 and **P0.01 versus con. OD, optical density; con, control; SH, sodium houttuyfonate. the correlative coefficient is 0.961718. the results from the present study provide a potential theoretical basis for the treatment of RA. a suitable dose of SH may almost completely inhibit synovial proliferation."}
