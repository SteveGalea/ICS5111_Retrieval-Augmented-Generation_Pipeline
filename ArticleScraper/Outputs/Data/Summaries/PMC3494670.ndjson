{"summary": "the most common high-risk HPV types in cervical cancer are HPV 16 and 18. the most common low-risk types causing genital warts are HPV 6 and 11. some studies suggest 70% of cervical epithelial cell dysplasia and cervical cancer is closely related to HPV 16 and 18 infection. more than 90% of external genital warts is caused by HPV 6 and 11 infection. preventing infections from these viruses can be an effective way to control the incidence of cervical cancer and cauliflower excrescence. allGlo probe generates two light-emitting fluorophores per cleavage event. the optimal Tm of the oligonucleotide of the AllGlo probe is the same temperature for annealing/extension, not ten degrees higher. this short oligonucleotide is advantageous in single mismatch discrimination. ginal secretions (220 specimens), leucorrhoea (30 specimens), cauliflower excrescence warts (200 specimens), and other tissues (10 specimens) were collected from Hangzhou First People\u2019s Hospital, China. all of the specimens were subject to DNA extraction, to detection of HPV genotype by HPV GA test (Hybribio Ltd., Hong Kong) targetgene Primers Primer sequences Probe Product Length (Bp)
