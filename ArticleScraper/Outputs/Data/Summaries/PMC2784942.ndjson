{"summary": "zoonotic pathogens, such as influenza and SARS, account for the majority of emerging infectious diseases in people. more than three-quarters of emerging zoonoses are the result of wildlife-origin pathogens. water resources are perhaps most crucial, as humans and animals depend on safe water for health and survival, and sources of clean water are dwindling due to demands from agriculture and global climate change. human population in sub-saharan africa doubled between 1975 and 2001. the African Population and Health Research Center predicts another doubling from 2008 levels to 1.9 billion by 2050. such rapid population growth and consequent demands for natural resources are making African wildlands increasingly vulnerable to conversion to other land uses. water resources are perhaps most crucial, as humans and animals depend on safe water for health and survival, and sources of clean water are dwindling due to demands from agriculture and global climate change. water scarcity also means that people and animals use the same water sources for drinking and bathing, which leads to serious contamination of drinking water and zoonotic diseases. a recent analysis by Wittermyer et al. found that average annual population growth rates were higher in buffers to protected areas than in rural areas in Africa and Latin America. Protected areas provide some of the last supplies of ecosystem goods and services for expanding human populations. their porous edges also provide refuge for vectors of zoonotic disease transmission. the health of domestic animals, wildlife, and people is inextricably linked to the ecosystem and natural resources on which all depend [12] zoonotic diseases and resource limitation are present in wildlife, domestic animals, and people in rural Tanzania. zoonotic diseases known to be of public health importance, such as rabies and Rift Valley fever, are present in wildlife. nearly 40,000 new cases of tuberculosis are diagnosed per year in Tanzania [20], with anywhere from 21% to 77% of. Tanzanian tuberculosis patients also infected with HIV [21]. bovine tuberculosis became a focal disease for the HALI project due to its high livestock prevalence [22], wildlife data paucity. disease detection; training Tanzanians of all education levels about zoonotic diseases; and developing new health and environmental policy interventions to mitigate the impacts of zoonotic diseases. the HALI project's multilevel approach to assessing the impact of the interactions between water and disease in the Ruaha ecosystem. 159 household surveys examining economic risk factors. 18 detailed household diaries, including gender differences. 75% of households did not consider sharing water with livestock or wildlife. the health of domestic animals, wildlife, and people is inextricably linked to the ecosystem and natural resources on which all depend [12] zoonotic diseases and resource limitation are present in wildlife, domestic animals, and people in rural Tanzania. zoonotic diseases known to be of public health importance, such as rabies and Rift Valley fever, are present in wildlife, domestic animals, and people. nearly 40,000 new cases of tuberculosis are diagnosed per year in Tanzania [20], with anywhere from 21% to 77% of Tanzanian tuberculosis patients also infected with HIV. the extrapulmonary form of tuberculosis (EPTB) in people accounts for 20% of the reported cases in Tanzania [20]. introducing new diagnostic techniques for disease detection. training Tanzanians of all education levels about zoonotic diseases. training for 24 game scouts and technicians. 159 household surveys examining economic risk factors (subset resampled seasonally) examine land and water use impacts on daily workloads. 18 detailed household diaries, including gender differences, and 20 village and district leaders interviews. zoonosis emergence is spatially and temporally variable within rural communities. most people living in high risk areas are not aware of the danger or what can be done to reduce it. underlying water- and land-use determinants of disease must be explored. effective surveillance, assessments, and interventions are possible only by bridging organizational gaps among institutions studying and managing wildlife, livestock, water, and public health. education in global health, especially emerging zoonotic diseases, is urgently needed at all levels from research institutions to pastoralist communities. the donor community should be encouraged to transcend disciplinary conventions and invest in holistic health projects that have the best chance of affecting change."}
