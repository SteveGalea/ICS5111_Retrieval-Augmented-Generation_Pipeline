{"summary": "HFMD cases are usually mild and self-limiting but for few cases leads to complicated severe clinical outcomes, and even death. previous studies have indicated that serum Ang II levels in patients with H7N9 infection were related to the severity of infection. however, the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of severe HFMD remain unclear. enterovirus 71 (EV71) and coxsackie A16 (CA16) infection is main cause of HFMD outbreaks. for few cases viral infection leads to complicated clinical outcomes including brainstem encephalitis, aseptic meningitis, encephalitis and acute flaccid paralysis. angiotensin II (Ang II) is an active octapeptide that acts primarily on Ang II receptor type 1 (AT1R) high concentration of NA in circulation is thought to associate with pulmonary edema [19], which may involve with fatal pulmonary edema in severe HFMD. patients with severe symptoms including meningitis, pulmonary edema, and mild cases without any nervous system lesions or pulmonary edema were excluded from this study. the children without any disease were classified as control. in serum or tissue lysates were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (TSZ, Boston, USA) data analysis SPSS 17.0 (IBM, NC, USA) was used for the statistical analysis. a significance level 0.05 was used for this study. strain (2106 pfu/mouse) and sacrificed with isoflurane on 3, 5 and 7 days post infection (dpi) the 3-day-old mice injected with the same volume of RD cell culture supernatants were used as controls. concentrations of Ang II and NA were increased in serum of severe cases. the concentrations of Ang II and NA in serum were significantly higher than those in healthy controls. the highest level of NA in severe cases occurred at 3 dpi. the concentrations of NA among the 5 subgroups in mild cases were not significantly different. the concentrations of NA among the 5 subgroups in severe cases were significantly different. mice were sacrificed on 3, 5, 7 dpi, brains, skeletal muscle and lungs removed. tissue was weighted and lysated by cold PBS, followed by centrifugation at 3,000g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. concentrations of Ang II and NA were determined using ELISA kits. the concentrations of Ang II and NA in serum were significantly higher than those in healthy controls. the concentrations of Ang II and NA in serum were significantly higher than those mild or severe cases, P0.05. correlation test was used to analyze the relationship between Ang II and NA in serum of all subjects. the concentrations of Ang II among the 5 subgroups of the severe were significantly different and increased from the 2 dpi to 4 dpi (P0.001). the highest level of Ang II in serum of the severe cases occurred at 3 dpi. concentrations of Ang II and NA in EV71-infected mice increased Ang II and NA levels in target organs. mice were sacrificed on 3, 5, 7 dpi and the brains, skeletal muscle and lungs were removed. results showed that EV71 infection increased Ang II and NA levels in target organs. brain from EV71-infected mice appeared necrotizing myositis. muscle fibers ruptured at 5 dpi and 7 dpi. mortality of severe HFMD is 1.9%, which is extremely higher than total mortality. the highest levels of Ang II and NA occurred at 3 dpi in HFMD cases. the highest levels of some inflammatory cytokines occurred at 3 dpi in HFMD cases. the highest levels of NA occurred at 3 dpi in HFMD cases. concentration of Ang II were able to be used as prognostic indicators. these studies suggested that with viral infection, the pathogens could damage the homeostasis of the lung RAS, alter the local blood pressure and vascular permeability. together, above evidence suggest that EV71 infection-induced pulmonary edema may be an outcome of RAS activation."}
