{"summary": "in mice, SINV infects neurons and induces encephalomyelitis. the severity of disease is dependent on several factors, including the strain of virus and the age and genetic background of the mouse. cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) and regulatory T cells (Tregs) control the inflammatory response and contribute to host survival (20\u201323. IL-10 deficiency rendered Bc mice susceptible to lethal encephalomyelitis. mice were perfused with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) mice were sex matched and intranasally infected at 4 to 6 weeks of age with 105 PFU of NSV (9) diluted in 20 l Hanks' balanced salt solution. slices were postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h at 4\u00b0C. sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), coded, and scored as previously described (11) using a scale of 0 to 3 as follows. sections were stained using the TACS TdT In Situ Apoptosis Detection kit. RNA was isolated from frozen tissue using the RNeasy Lipid Mini RNA isolation kit (Qiagen) cDNA was prepared with the High Capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Life Technologies) using 2.5 l of cDNA, TaqMan gene expression arrays, and 2 Universal PCR Mastermix. cell types were defined as microglia (CD45lo CD11b+ Ly6G Ly6C+), macrophages/monocytes (CD45hi CD11b+ Ly6G Ly6C+), neutrophils (CD45+ CD11b+ Ly6G Ly6C+), neutrophils (CD45+ CD11b+ Ly6G Ly6C+) 2 106 to 3 106 cells were stimulated with RPMI\u20131% FBS. cells were washed, and live/dead staining, blocking, and surface staining were performed as described above. 96-well Maxisorp plates (Nalgene Nunc) were coated with 106 PFU/well of polyethylene glycol (PEG)-precipitated SINV strain TE in 50 mM NaHCO3 (pH 9.6) at 4\u00b0C overnight. blocking buffer (10% FBS and 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS) was added for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. the limit of detection for each of the cytokines and chemokines was as follows: IL-12p70, 107 pg/g; TNF-, 73 pg/g; IFN-, 25 pg/g; CCL2, 527 pg/g; IL-10, 175 pg/g; and IL-6, 50 pg/g). mice were perfused with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and bled via cardiac puncture. brains, spinal cords, and cervical lymph nodes were collected and stored at 80\u00b0C. sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), coded, and scored as previously described (11) for histological analysis of inflammation. sections were stained using the TACS TdT In Situ Apoptosis Detection kit (Trevigen), developed with 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine (DAB; Vector), and counterstained with hematoxylin. RNA was isolated from frozen tissue using the RNeasy Lipid Mini RNA isolation kit (Qiagen) cDNA was quantified using a nanodrop spectrophotometer. quantitative real-time PCR was performed using 2.5 l of cDNA. the homogenate was filtered through a 70-m filter. mononuclear cells at the interface were collected and resuspended. cells were stained with the violet Live/Dead Fixable Cell Stain kit (Invitrogen) in PBS\u20132 mM EDTA. 2 106 to 3 106 cells were stimulated with RPMI\u20131% FBS. cells were washed, and live/dead staining, blocking, and surface staining were performed. 96-well Maxisorp plates coated with 106 PFU/well of polyethylene glycol (PEG)-precipitated SINV strain TE in 50 mM NaHCO3 at 4\u00b0C overnight. blocking buffer (10% FBS and 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS) was added for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. in clarified brain homogenates were determined using a cytometric bead array mouse inflammation kit (BD Pharmingen) the limit of detection for each of the cytokines and chemokines was as follows: IL-12p70, 107 pg/g; TNF-, 73 pg/g; IFN-, 25 pg/g; CCL2, 527 pg/g; and IL-6, 50 pg/g). disease in B6 mice progressed through stages of hind limb paralysis, full body paralysis, and death. none of the infected B6 mice survived, whereas 93% of Bc mice survived. data are presented as the mean numbers of TUNEL+ cells/mm2 SEM. B6 (black bar), n = 4, and Bc (white bar), n = 4; *, P 0.05. neuronal cell death is associated with a fatal outcome during NSV infection. viral antigen was also present in the brains of B6 and Bc mice 7 days after infection. in contrast to what was observed for the brain, spinal cord viral titers were similar. these data showed that virus clearance was slower in B6 mice than Bc mice. we measured brain levels of IFN- and IFN- (Fig. 2D and E) B6 mice had higher levels of IFN- 3 days (P 0.001) and of IFN- 5 days (P 0.001) and 7 days (P 0.01) after infection (Fig. 2E) than Bc mice. this suggests higher levels of virus stimulate greater production of type I IFN. B6 mice were infected intranasally with 105 PFU of NSV. inflammation was assessed 5 and 7 days after infection. B6 mice also had more total cells than Bc mice 7 days after infection. coronal sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. the mean inflammation score was higher for B6 mice than Bc mice. the difference did not reach statistical significance. macrophages at 7 days were higher in Bc mice than in B6 mice. the number of monocytes was higher in B6 mice 7 days after infection. cells were analyzed to identify macrophages/monocytes, microglia, neutrophils, T cells. proinflammatory cytokine gene expression was greater in the CNS of B6 than Bc mice. the brains of B6 mice had higher levels of Il1 (P = 0.0187), Tnf (P 0.0001), Il6 (P 0.001), Csf2 (P 0.0001), and Ccl2 (P 0.0001) mRNAs than Bc mice. expression of Ifn (P 0.0001) and Cxcl10 (P 0.0001) was greater in data were pooled from 2 independent experiments and represent means SEM for 3 or 4 mice at each time point. protein levels of cytokines and chemokines in the brains of B6 and Bc mice were determined using a cytometric bead array assay. mice had higher levels of Tnf (P = 0.0172), Il6 (P = 0.0165), Il12b (P 0.0001), Csf2 (P = 0.0207) and Ccl2 (P = 0.0012) than Bc mice at peak inflammation. B6 mice also had higher levels of Ifn (P = 0.0013) and Cxcl10 (P 0.05) mRNAs in the spinal cord. proportion of CD3+ T cells that were CD8+ was higher in the cervical lymph nodes of B6 than Bc mice 5 days after infection. in the brain, the CD8+ T cell proportion was higher 7 days after infection in B6 than Bc mice. in the brain, the CD8+ T cell proportion was higher 7 days after infection in B6 than Bc mice. Bc mice had a higher CD4/CD8 T cell ratio than B6 mice. production of effector molecules by CD8+ T cells in the cervical lymph nodes and brains was greater in B6 mice. this resulted in more cervical lymph node CD8+ T cells. T cells producing IFN-, TNF-, and granzyme B were analyzed by flow cytometry. the proportion (% of CD8+ T cells) and number of CD8+ T cells that produce IFN-, TNF-, and granzyme B were calculated as the means SEM. B6 mice had a higher proportion of CD8+ T cells that produced IFN-, TNF-, and granzyme B than Bc mice. by 7 days after infection, the proportions of CD8+ T cells producing IFN-, TNF-, and granzyme B were similar. by 7 days after infection, the proportions of CD8+ T cells producing IFN-, TNF-, and granzyme B were similar. there were more IFN--producing CD4+ T cells in B6 than Bc mice. cells were isolated from the cervical lymph nodes and brains of B6 and Bc mice. by 7 days after infection, there were no significant differences in the proportion or number of Th1, Th2, or Th17 cells. regulatory T cells that express IL-10 can play an important role during virus infection and inflammation in the CNS. there was no difference in the proportion or number of CD4+ CD25+ foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the cervical lymph nodes and brains of B6 and Bc mice. the proportions (% of CD4 T cells) and numbers of CD25+ foxp3+ Tregs were determined. data are presented as the means SEM from 2 to 4 independent experiments. expression of IL-10 was induced in the brains and spinal cords of both B6 and Bc mice during NSV infection. differences in protein levels of IL-10 in the brains of B6 and Bc mice could not be determined because the levels were below the limit of detection. the number and frequency (% of parent) of IL-10-producing cells were calculated as the means SEM from 3 or 4 independent experiments. the survival was 91% in Bc WT mice and 28.5% in Bc IL-10/ mice with a mean day of death of 9. by 7 days after infection, there was a significantly higher proportion of CD4+ T cells that produced IL-10 in Bc mice than B6 mice. there were more CD4+ T cells (8.1 104 versus 2.6 104 cells, P = 0.0555) and Tregs (1.1 105 versus 1.9 103 cells, P = 0.0218) producing IL-10 in the brains of Bc mice. the mean day of death for IL-10/ Bc mice was 9 days after infection. Bc mice showed a milder course of disease after NSV infection than B6 mice. previous studies have shown that Bc mice are less likely to die after NSV infection than B6 mice (8). survival was assessed using a Kaplan-Meier analysis and log rank test. survival was 0% with a mean day of death of 8 for B6 mice and was 93.3% for Bc mice. increased virus replication with higher levels of viral antigen and viral RNA early after infection were previously observed in B6 mice compared to BALB/cBy mice (8). but these effects have not been evaluated in BALB/cJ mice. representative images were acquired at a magnification of 4. Scale bar, 500 m; B6, n = 4, and Bc, n = 4. (D and E) IFN- (D) and IFN- (E) levels in the brains of B6 and Bc mice during NSV infection determined by EIA. data are from 3 independent experiments and represent the means SEM for 8 mice (infected) at each time point. more-rapid production of SINV antibody in the brains of Bc mice led to earlier virus clearance. inflammation was more intense in B6 mice than in Bc mice. cells isolated and pooled (n = 3 to 5) from the cervical lymph nodes. proportion (% of live cells) and absolute numbers of cells per animal of macrophages (B), monocytes (C), neutrophils (D), CD3+ T cells (E) and B cells (F) data represent the means SEM from 3 or 4 independent experiments. tologic evidence of inflammation, coronal brain sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin and coded sections were scored using a 4-point scale. the mean inflammation score was higher for B6 mice than Bc mice (2.9 versus 2.1) but the difference did not reach statistical significance. s, microglia, neutrophils, T cells, and B cells were abundant 5 days after infection. the brains of B6 mice had higher levels of Il1 (P = 0.0187), Tnf (P. 0.0519) and microglial cells (P = 0.0094) at 5 days after infection. expression of Il12b in the brain did not differ, while expression of Ifn (P 0.0001) and Cxcl10 (P 0.0001) was greater in Bc than B6 mice. B6 and Bc mice were infected intranasally with 105 PFU NSV. Bc and B6 mice had similar levels of Il6 mRNA through 5 days after infection. IL-6 protein levels were substantially higher in B6 mice (P 0.0001), suggesting a difference in posttranscriptional control of protein synthesis. phenotyped cells isolated from the cervical lymph nodes and brains of mice 5 and 7 days after infection using flow cytometry. in the cervical lymph nodes, the proportion of T cells that were CD4+ was higher in Bc mice at 5 days (86.9% versus 76%, P = 0.0080) this was also observed in the brains, where CD4+ T cells constituted a higher proportion of CD3+ T cells in Bc than B6 mice at 5 days (53.4% proportions (% of CD3+ T cells) of CD4+ (A, B) and CD8+ (C, D) T cells were determined. in the cervical lymph nodes, the ratio of CD4+ T cells to CD8+ T cells was higher in Bc than B6 mice 7 days after infection (2.59 versus 1.35, P = 0.0047) cervical lymph node CD8+ T cells from B6 and Bc mice were more likely to produce the effector molecules IFN- (5 days, 57.7% versus 27.9%, P = 0.0128; 7 days, 82% versus 23.4%, P = 0.0001) and TNF- (5 days, 53.1% versus 27.1%, P = 0.0144; 7 days, 66.9% versus 14.1%, P = 0.0019) CD8+ T cell production of IFN-, TNF-, and granzyme B was analyzed by flow cytometry. the proportion (% of CD8+ T cells) and number of CD8+ T cells that produce IFN-, TNF-, and granzyme B were calculated as the means SEM from 3 independent experiments. CD4+ T cells contribute to disease pathogenesis during NSV infection in B6 mice (12) but Bc mice had more CD4+ T cells in the cervical lymph nodes and in the CNS than B6 mice. production of IFN-, IL-4, and IL-17a in ex vivo-stimulated CD4+ T cells isolated from the cervical lymph nodes and brains was evaluated 5 and 7 days after infection. there were more IFN-- and IL-4-producing CD4+ T cells in B6 mice. by 7 days after infection, there were no significant differences between B6 and Bc mice in the proportion or number of Th1, Th2, or Th17 cells. a lesser Th17 response 5 days after infection may lead to less severe disease. 0% versus 3.7%, P 0.0001) after infection (Fig. 9C and D) and significantly more CD4+ CD25+ foxp3+ T cells than in B6 mice at 5 days (4.2 104 versus 1.3 104 cells, P = 0.0198) and 7 days (8.1 104 versus 1.4 104 cells, P = 0.0157) after infection. IL-2 plays a very important role in the development and maintenance of a regulatory T cell response (35\u201338) levels of Il2 mRNA were 3- to 5-fold higher in the brains and spinal cords of Bc mice than B6 mice. this suggests immune regulation may play an important role in protecting Bc mice from severe immunopathology leading to death during NSV infection. Il10 mRNA expression was measured by qRT-PCR in the brains (A) and spinal cords (B) of NSV-infected B6 (filled circle, solid line) and Bc (open square, dashed line) mice. CT values were normalized to GAPDH, and fold change was calculated relative to uninfected controls. survival was 91% in Bc WT mice and 28.5% in Bc IL-10/ mice. cells were isolated from the brains of B6 and Bc mice 5 and 7 days after infection. there were more IL-10-producing CD4+ T cells in Bc mice than B6 mice. IL-10 plays an important role in delaying death from NSV infection in the lethal B6 model of infection (15), but the importance of IL-10 in NSV infection that does not result in lethal disease is unknown. IL-10/ Bc mice developed more-severe disease than WT Bc mice with signs of hind limb and full-body paralysis beginning 8 days after infection. B6 mice had more cellular infiltration into the CNS, higher levels of proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine gene expression. but Bc mice had a higher proportion of CD4+ T cells that included more regulatory T cells that produced IL-10 and higher levels of Il2 and Cxcl10 mRNAs than B6 mice. clearance by Bc mice was not associated with higher levels of effector CD8+ T cells or levels of IFN- protein. clearance by Bc mice was not associated with higher levels of effector CD8+ T cells or levels of IFN- protein. fewer B cells in the cervical lymph nodes but more B cells in the brains of Bc than B6 mice suggests better recruitment of B cells into the brains. the Th17 response, previously associated with onset of disease in B6 mice (15), was higher in B6 than Bc mice 5 days after infection. however, the most striking difference in the CD4+ T cell response was a greater representation of Tregs in Bc mice. effective transfer of virus-specific Tregs producing IL-10 suppresses CD4+ T cell effector function and improves survival (20), while Treg depletion increases T cell infiltration and mortality (46, 51). the exact effect that Tregs exert in Bc mice that leads to protection is still unclear. resistant mice showed a more rapid antibody response and a higher CD4/CD8 T cell ratio. without the immunoregulatory cytokine IL-10, resistant mice became susceptible to lethal NSV infection."}
