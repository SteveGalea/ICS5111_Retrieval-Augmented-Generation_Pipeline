{"summary": "HCV is a major cause of chronic liver disease and is the major cause of liver cancer in the united states. insufficient host immune response in eliminating HCV leads to persistent infection and the eventual development of liver diseases. insufficient host immune response in eliminating HCV leads to persistent infection. NS5A is shown to up-regulate Mn superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) through AP1 transcription factor. additional studies showed the involvement of NS5A in ER stress and disturbance of intracellular Ca+2 homeostasis. studies have also been carried out to identify HCV proteins responsible for the hepatocarcinogenesis. core protein to model the state of persistent HCV infection. core protein expression levels suggested that core-on cells produced higher levels of core protein than the genome-length replicon cells. immunogold EM was carried out with antibodies against core, NS5A, and NS5B proteins. mitochondrial injury as common defect among genome-length replicon, subgenomic replicon, and Core-on cells with enlarged mitochondria. accumulation of lipid droplets (L), focal loss of cristae (arrow head) and presence of autophagocytic vacuoles (arrow) and double membrane vesicles (DMV) replicon, and Core-on cells stained with Hoechst. data in B and C are presented as mean SEM. mitochondrial aconitases (ACO1 and ACO2) are very sensitive to inactivation by reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. reduction in aconitase protein levels and enzyme activities has been used as indicators for increased oxidative stress in their respective subcellular compartments. western blot analyses showed a marked increase of LC3-I and LC3-II in genome-length replicon and subgenomic replicon cells. however, the ratios between LC3-I and II were not changed. autophagosomes were not detected in HCV transgenic mice expressing the full-length HCV polyprotein. despite comparable levels of CuZnSOD, MnSOD, and catalase expression, LC3 levels were not altered in genome-length replicon cells. however, LC3-II levels were only significantly increased in genomic replicon and core-off cells. addition of CAT to the X/XO treatment diminished the increase of total LC3 in genome-length and subgenomic replicon cells. LC3 levels were normalized to that of -actin. significant results from one-way ANOVA are shown. p0.05 when compared to mock or no treatment controls. protein levels of antioxidant enzymes in the cytosol and mitochondria were determined by western blot analyses. data are presented as mean SEM of three (PRDX and TRX) or four (SOD) independent experiments. immunogold EM was carried out with antibodies against core, NS5A, and NS5B proteins. the majority of core, NS5A, and NS5B proteins were located in the mitochondria and the ER. mitochondrial injury is common defect among genome-length replicon, subgenomic replicon, and Core-on cells. lipid droplets (L), focally dilated RER (arrow head) and presence of autophagocytic vacuoles (arrow) and double membrane vesicles (DMV) a representative EM image from subgenomic replicon cells shows the presence of autophagocytic vacuoles (A) and autophagocytic vesicles (a). a minimum of 12 cells each were analyzed. data are presented as mean SEM. cytosolic and mitochondrial aconitases (ACO1 and ACO2) are very sensitive to inactivation by reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. reduction in aconitase protein levels and enzyme activities have been used as indicators for increased oxidative stress in their respective subcellular compartments. western blot analyses showed a marked increase of LC3-I and LC3-II in genome-length replicon and subgenomic replicon cells. however, the ratios between LC3-I and II were not changed. autophagosomes were not detected in HCV transgenic mice expressing the full-length HCV polyprotein. X/XO treatment significantly increased total LC3 levels in genomic replicon and subgenomic replicon cells. however, LC3-II levels were only significantly increased in genomic replicon and core-off cells. addition of CAT to the X/XO treatment diminished the increase of total LC3 in genome-length and subgenomic replicon cells. western blot analyses were carried out to determine the protein levels of CuZnSOD, MnSOD, peroxiredoxin 1 (PRDX1), peroxiredoxin 3 (PRDX3), thioredoxin 1 (TRX1), and thioredoxin 2 (TRX2). sulfonylated peroxiredoxins (PRDX-SO3) were also monitored and served as indicators for the redox state in HCV protein protein levels of antioxidant enzymes in the cytosol and mitochondria were determined by western blot analyses. all protein levels were normalized to that of -actin. population doubling time was increased in cells expressing genome-length replicon. expression of non-structural proteins also led to membrane blebbing in the ER and accumulation of autophagocytic vacuoles. despite these changes, only cells with the genome-length replicon showed consistent up-regulation of mitochondrial and cytosolic antioxidant enzymes. cells expressing only non-structural proteins were also shown to have suffered from mitochondrial damage. the extent of damage was comparable to that of cells expressing the full-length polyprotein or core protein. the data suggests multiple HCV proteins are capable of entering the mitochondria and cause increased oxidative stress. our study results suggest that HCV non-structural proteins are capable of causing increased oxidative stress in both the mitochondrial and cytosolic compartments. the effects of core protein is mainly limited to the mitochondria. some RNA viruses develop the abilities to overcome such cellular defense by hijacking the autophagocytic pathway to facilitate viral replication [34]\u2013[37]. core-on cells had a slight increase in autophagy without a significant increase in LC3-II or total LC3 levels. oxidative stress was likely a contributor in the activation of autophagy. increased antioxidant capacity in either compartment achieved comparable levels of reduction. increased oxidative stress effectively increased autophagy in genome-length replicon cells. oxidative stress may not play a significant role in the basal level of autophagy in genome-length replicon cells. however, cells are sensitive to additional oxidative stress. despite the up-regulation of multiple antioxidant enzymes, the ratios of oxidized (Sulfonic form) to total peroxiredoxin 1 and 3 in the subgenomic replicon cells remained the same as that in Huh7 cells. this conclusion was supported by increased MitoSOX staining and reduced aconitase activities. genome-length replicon cells had prolonged population doubling time and reduced cyclin D1 expression. despite elevated levels of ROS, these cells failed to mount a robust antioxidant response. despite the elevated levels of ROS, these cells showed a robust antioxidant response. stress can cause increased DNA damage and mutation, inactivation of redox-sensitive proteins, and activation of redox-sensitive signaling pathways. cytopathic effects work in concert in the course of chronic HCV infection to promote cell death, hepatocyte turnover, alteration of the liver microenvironment. the genome-length replicon and subgenomic replicon were derived from a genotype 1a H77c infectious molecular clone. the genome-length replicon encodes the full-length HCV polyprotein (core, E1, E2, p7, and NS2-NS5). the subgenomic replicon encodes only the non-structural proteins NS2-NS5B. all cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. expression of HCV proteins in genome-length and subgenomic replicon cells monitored by western blot analysis. only male mice were used in this study. mice were perfused through the left ventricle of the heart, first with 10 U/ml heparin in saline until the liver was cleared of blood. then with fixative (2% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1M Na Cacodylate, pH 7.4) until the liver was completely fixed. a peristaltic pump (VWR, Westchester, PA, USA) with the flow rate set at 4.5 ml staining solution was replaced with 500 L pre-warmed HBSS. cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 minutes. staining solution was then replaced with 500 L pre-warmed HBSS. total aconitase activities were determined with a kinetic assay. cell pellets were resuspended in aconitase buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8, 2 mM citric acid, and 0.6 mM MnCl2) and passed through two rounds of freeze-thaw cycle. cell lysates were prepared 36 hrs after the transfection for western blot analysis of LC3. to increase oxidative stress, cells were grown to 50% confluency in complete culture medium in 6-well plates.
