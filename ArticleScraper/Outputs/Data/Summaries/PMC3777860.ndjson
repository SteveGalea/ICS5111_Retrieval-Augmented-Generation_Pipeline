{"summary": "enveloped viruses usurp the cellular secretory machinery in order to achieve the efficient transport of progeny viruses to the plasma membrane. non-enveloped viruses are thought to be released as mature virions through a cytolysis burst at the end of infection. however, there is evidence on non-enveloped virus egress through active transport besides the major lytic pathway. vesicles at ER exit sites are triggered by the activation of the small GTPase Sar1. sec23\u2013sec24 is responsible for the selection and binding of the cargo. sec23\u2013sec24 can either bind directly to the transported protein if it features a transmembrane domain, or interact with a transmembrane receptor specific to the cargo. a number of other Rab proteins are also involved in vesicle targeting to the endocytosis and secretion pathways. a number of other Rab proteins are also involved in vesicle targeting to the endocytosis and secretion pathways. radixin (Rdx) has been implicated in the interplay between filamentous actin and membrane structures. NS1/CKII-mediated phosphorylation seems to play a crucial role in this process. the present investigation aims to characterize vesicular egress of non-enveloped lytic parvoviruses in more detail. progeny PV particles showed clear colocalization with the cellular vesicle forming complex, giving a first hint that MVM virions may associate with cellular vesicles assembled at the ER membrane. progeny PV particles showed clear colocalization with the cellular vesicle forming complex. cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde at 4 h (Input) or 24 h (MVM 24 h) p.i.. lack of interference from input virions is revealed by absence of detectable capsid signal at 4 h p.i. a fractionation experiment was performed after cell transfection with clone. the migration of Lamp2 (lysosomes/late endosomes) was determined by western blotting. cell extracts were treated with or triton X-100 (disruption of membranes, release of membrane associated proteins into cytoplasm) and proteinase K (elimination of all proteins that are unprotected by membrane structures) before fractionation. a 4 h p.i. time-point was chosen to discriminate egress from the infection process. progeny virions are transported through directional movement of vesicles carriers from ER to the Golgi apparatus. progeny virions are transported through one or the other compartment of the cellular secretory pathway before mature virions are released. strong colocalizations were observed between MVM particles and the ER resident protein calnexin, the Golgi complex marker gm130 and the small GTPases Rab1 and Rab6, known to control vesicular transfer between these compartments. the presence of MVM progeny particles in ER and Golgi was confirmed by biochemical fractionation of cellular extracts. infected cells from three experiments with >10 cells. cells were transduced with rAAV virions expressing dominant-negative (and functionally active) Rab proteins. cells were co-transduced with rAAV:P38-dnRab. activator protein specific for this promoter (rAAV:P4-Transactivator) is comprised of two distinct NS1 domains, the N-terminal site-specific DNA-binding domain (aa 1\u2013275) and the C-terminal transactivator domain (aa 545\u2013672) linked by GFP. this polypeptide expressed from the PV P4-promoter proved to be non-toxic. rAAV:P38-dnSar1 and rAAV:P38-dnSar1 were a positive control. rab-protein functioning was inhibited by over-expression of dominant-negative rab-variant (dnRab1, dnRab8, dnRab11), transduced by rAAV 24 h prior to parvovirus infection. cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde and stained for MVM capsids together with either Sec23 (ER) or Rab6 (golgi), respectively. colocalization was quantified by image J analyzing 10 infected cells from three individual experiments. impact on viral egress measured in vesicles, viral capsid intracellular distribution and colocalization with cellular compartment marker proteins. dominant-negative moesin (MoeT547A) and radixin (Rdxdl[P]) mutants strongly interfered with the loading of progeny virions into cytoplasmic vesicles (Fig. 4A and C) A9 cells were infected with MVMp (30 pfu/cell), NCH149 cells with hgH1-PV (30 pfu/cells) the presence of progeny particles was determined by western blotting. the presence of progeny particles was determined by Southern blotting. cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde and stained for MVM capsids together with either Sec23 (ER), Rab6 (golgi), Rab8 (TGN) or Rab11 (RE) colocalization was quantified by image J analyzing 10 infected cells from three individual experiments. medium and cell-associated virions were collected separately and quantified by dot-blot hybridization analyses. ERM proteins are known mediators of the interplay between actin cytoskeleton and membrane structures. involvement of Rdx and Moe in the formation/loading of PV-containing vesicles raised the question, whether these proteins are selectively recruited by PVs. this was investigated by expressing the secreted protein GLuc in mouse A9 and human NCH149 cells. time-course experiments were performed with MVM infected A9 cells. permeabilization of the plasma membrane was then measured by propidium-iodide incorporation. infection of A9 cells with rMVM was used to measure the mere lytic activity induced upon NS1 expression. dnRab8 did not impair egress of PVs. vesicular transport plays an important role in induction of cytolysis. progeny MVM particles become modified during egress through. ER and Golgi resulting in a gain of infectivity Vesicular trafficking through the Golgi apparatus raises the intriguing possibility of assembled PV particles undergoing maturation and gaining full infectivity. this prompted us to first determine whether the egress process was accompanied with post-assembly phosphorylations of MVM capsids. newly synthesized capsids were isolated by immunoprecipitation, purified by SDS-PAGE and subjected to tryptic phosphopeptide analyses. newly synthesized capsids were isolated by immunoprecipitation, purified by SDS-PAGE and analyzed for their phosphor amino acid composition by 2D-electrophoresis. virus stocks were purified on CsCl-gradients to remove empty capsids. they were matched for their ssDNA content and tested for their infectivity in A9 cells. progeny particles that had transited through the Golgi complex in parental A9 cells proved to be significantly more infectious. progeny PV particles become associated to vesicles in a gelsolin-dependent manner. progeny particles are actively transported from the nuclear periphery to the plasma membrane. the absence of capsid fluorescence at 4 h p.i. was taken as a reference for the selective detection of newly produced virions after onset of virus propagation. however, cell reinfection with progeny particles was prevented by addition of neutralizing antibodies to the medium after the initial infection. progeny PV particles showed clear colocalization with the cellular vesicle forming complex. cell lysates were treated with Triton X-100 (Triton) or proteinase K (Prot K) prior to fractionation. a fractionation experiment was performed after cell transfection with MVM infectious clone in presence of neutralizing antibodies. medium and cell-associated virions were collected separately and quantified by dot-blot hybridization analyses for the DNA content and by standard plaque assays for infectious particles. vesicle formation was determined by cell fractionation and monitoring single-stranded virion DNA presence in the corresponding biochemical fractions. similar results were obtained with the related rodent parvovirus strain hgH1-PV after infection of the human glioblastoma cell line NCH149. vesicular egress of progeny virions is a general feature of rodent PVs. small GTPases Rab1 (ER to Golgi), Rab 8 (Trans Golgi network to PM) and Rab11 (recycling endosomes) were investigated by confocal laser scanning microscopy. strong colocalizations were observed between MVM particles and the ER resident protein calnexin. ER membranes from the Golgi complex by ultracentrifugation on a nycodenz gradient centrifugation. progeny virions were detected by southern blotting measuring single-stranded virion DNA, the presence of golgi and calnexin (ER) dnRab mutant genes were transduced with rAAV virions expressing dominant-negative (and functionally active) Rab proteins. to ensure efficient expression, cells were co-transduced with rAAV:P38-dnRab and, in absence of PV NS1 protein (i.e. in absence of PV infection), with a second recombinant AAV virus expressing a transactivator protein specific for this promoter (rAAV:P dnRab1 and dnRab8 inhibited gi and further to the plasma membrane. no dominant-negative mutants prevented MVM particles from entering the ER compartment. a very limited reduction of secreted particles was observed with dnRab11, and nothing at all upon inhibition of Rab8. the amount of secreted GLuc was measured in the medium 72 h post transduction. rAAV:P38-dnRab11 and rAAV:P4-Transactivator served as a positive control. moesin (Moe) and radixin (Rdx) are involved in the vesicular transport of progeny particles. moesin (Moe) and radixin (Rdx) have been implicated in the spreading capacity of this parvovirus. this observation led us to determine whether ERM proteins may play a role in the vesicular egress of progeny PV virions. MVM virions became associated with the vesicular fractions. however, when vesicular egress through ER and Golgi was monitored, a strong decrease was observed in the colocalisation with the Golgi marker (Rab6, see Fig. S4). cellular vesicles were further purified from LMF by centrifugation through an iodixanol gradient. the presence of progeny particles was determined by western blotting. cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde at 4 (MVM 4 h) and 24 (MVM 24 h) p.i. the amount of secreted GLuc was measured in the medium 72 h post transduction. rAAV:P38-dnSar1 and rAAV:P38-GlnD565N transduced together with rAAV:P4-Transactivator served as controls. dnEz (EzT566A) failed to impair secretion. these data strongly argue for the essential role played by the ERM family proteins Rdx and Moe in the secretion of cellular proteins. dn mutant forms of these proteins inhibited in similar way PV egress. infection of A9 cells with rMVM was used to measure the mere lytic activity induced upon NS1 expression. vesicular transport was either inhibited (dnSar1, Rdxdl[P], dnRab1) or by-passing the Golgi apparatus. rMVM denotes transduction of A9 cells with a viral vector deficient for progeny virion particles production due to substitution of the transgene GFP for the structural gene region. PI positive cells and total number of cells from 3 fields of at least three individual experiments (>200 cells) were counted using Image J. capsid phosphorylation, effector protein variants known to inhibit viral egress were tested for their effects on the capsid tryptic phosphopeptide profile. the inhibition of vesicular egress or its re-routing away from the Golgi compartment led to remarkable changes in the capsid phosphorylation pattern. this includes the characteristic loss of three distinct phosphopeptides (a, c, and e) derivative cell lines of expressing dominant-negative CKII (CKII-E81A), dominant-negative moesin (MoeT547A), or mutant radixin Y146F (RdxY146F) were infected with MVM (30 pfu/cell) and 32P-labeled with orthophosphate at 24 h p.i. new capsids were isolated by immunoprecipitation, purified by SDS-PAGE egress through ER and golgi is accompanied by capsid modifications. these results suggest that the transport pathway to the plasma membrane represents an important step in the maturation of progeny virions. virions were matched and analyzed for their single-stranded DNA content. PVs usurp cellular components allowing progeny virion engulfment into COPII vesicles at the ER and moving through the Golgi to the plasma membrane under control of small Rab GTPases. radixin and moesin were found to be involved in the formation of PV-loaded COPII-vesicles. PVs appear to transit through the Golgi compartment, as evidenced by biochemical fractionations and co-staining data. this is unexpected, since in contrast with enveloped viruses, PVs do not acquire, during this transit, a lipid envelope harboring proteins mediating cell attachment and/or entry. this is not without precedent for non-enveloped lytic viruses as compared with non-enveloped lytic viruses. a number of parvoviruses transit through multi vesicular bodies (MVBs) during their transport to the PM. a common feature of these viruses consists in the presence in their structural proteins. this interaction promotes entry of viral particles into MVBs during HIV-infection. vesicular egress proved to have an impact on the still poorly understood mechanism of PV-induced cytolysis. this is apparent from the delay in or inhibition of infected cells lysis upon alteration of the virus egress route. the mechanism underlying this dependence of cytolysis on vesicular PV transport remains a matter of speculation. immunogenic [61] resulting in an immune bystander effect that takes over from the initial direct oncolytic effect of the viral treatment to complete eradication [62] it will be of great interest to determine whether the hereby reported vesicular egress of parvovirus particles also contributes to the display and/or release of tumor-associated antigens.
