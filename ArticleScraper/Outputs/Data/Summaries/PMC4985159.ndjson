{"summary": "vaccination is the most cost-effective way to prevent and control influenza outbreaks. vaccines include hemagglutinin (HA) viral surface protein, inducing strain-specific antibodies that protect against antigenically matched or closely related viruses. seasonal vaccines are not effective against newly emerging influenza viruses or pandemic outbreaks. stranded DNA viral vectors can protect against homologous and also heterosubtypic influenza challenge. mRNA vaccines preclude safety concerns about DNA integration into the host genome. non-viral delivery of self-amplifying mRNAs (SAM\u00ae technology) avoids manufacturing complications associated with viral vectors. we evaluated in mice the immunogenicity and efficacy of SAM vectors encoding NP and M1 antigens, separately or in combination, using lipid nanoparticles (LNP) as a synthetic, non-viral delivery system. RNA synthesis RNA was prepared as previously reported [33]. BHK cells were electroporated (120V, 25ms pulse) with 200 ng of RNA. cells were incubated for 16\u201318 h at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. dsRNA IgG2a was conjugated using the Zenon Allophycocianin labeling kit. NP was detected with anti-NP HB65 purified hybridoma (1:50) and M1 was detected with anti-M1 monoclonal antibody (1:200) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (1:5000) formulations were characterized for particle size, encapsulation efficiency and antigen expression in transfected cells. arby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were quantified as Tissue Culture Infectious Dose that yields 50% infection. a clinical score ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (moribund) was ascribed to each mouse and a score of 4 was defined as a humane endpoint. mouse immunogenicity and efficacy studies were conducted at the GSK Vaccines Animal Research Center. Maxisorp plates (Nunc) were coated overnight at 4\u00b0C with 0.26 g/well of NP or M1 proteins (Sinobiological) and blocked with SmartBlock (Candor) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. a standard serum, 2-fold serially diluted in PBS, 1% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20, was transferred into coated and blocked plates and then incubated 1 h at 37\u00b0C. to detect antigen-specific I 106 cells were plated with anti-CD28 mAb at a final concentration of 2 g/ml (Pharmingen) and with anti-CD107a FITC (2.5 g/ml; BD Biosciences) cells were stimulated for 6 h with H-2Kd-restricted NP peptide TYQRTRALV (2.5 g/ml; JPT), or with a M1 peptide pool library consisting of 15-mer a peptide pool (JPT) or a PR8/H1 peptide pool (Department of Biochemistry, University of Lausanne, Switzerland) were used for in vitro stimulation. the same number of cells was incubated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 alone as positive and negative controls. mice were immunized twice 8 weeks apart with 0.1 g of SAM(NP), 0.2 g of SAM(NP)+SAM(M1) or 0.1 g of SAM(M1-NP) to prepare target cells, splenocytes from nave mice were split into two populations. one population was pulsed for 1 h at 37\u00b0C with 5 M of NP147-155 peptide (TYQRTRALV), washed, and labeled with mice were infected with 105 TCID50 of PR8 (10.5 TCID50) or HK68 (1560 TCID50) mice were infected with 105 TCID50 of PR8. survival, body weight, and clinical signs of illness were monitored daily. the viral titers were calculated using the comparative Ct method [36] and were indicated as fold-increase to pre-infected sample. lungs were excised at 0, 3, 6 and 17 days after challenge. protocols approved by the Italian Ministry of Health and the Novartis Vaccines Animal Welfare Body. mice were monitored daily and euthanized when they exhibited defined humane endpoints that were pre-established in agreement with GSK Animal Welfare Policies. modified Eagle\u2019s medium (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA) containing 5% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. cells were electroporated (120V, 25ms pulse) with 200 ng of RNA. incubated for 16\u201318 h at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. transfected BHK cells were lysed and whole cell lysates of 2x105 cells were subjected to SDS-PAGE and blotted to PVDF membranes. NP was detected with anti-NP HB65 purified hybridoma (1:50) and M1 was detected with anti-M1 monoclonal antibody (1:200) mice aged 6\u20138 weeks were immunized intramuscularly (i.m.) on days 0 and 56 in quadriceps muscles. mice were infected intranasally (i.n.) (15 l per nostril) with low doses of PR8 (0.025 TCID50) or HK68 influenza viruses as controls. ELISA NP or M1-specific serum antibody titers were determined on individual sera collected 3 weeks after the first and 2 weeks after the second immunization. serum samples and a standard serum, 2-fold serially diluted in PBS, 1% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20, were transferred into coated and blocked plates and then incubated 1 h at 37\u00b0C. all samples were then incubated for 18 h at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 on MDCK cells, plated in a 96-well plate (2x104 cells/well) cells were then washed with PBS, fixed with Fixation Buffer (BD Cytofix) and permeabilized with a solution of PBS 0.1% BSA 0.1% Tween 20. a peptide pool or a PR8/H1 peptide pool were used for in vitro stimulation. the same number of cells was incubated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 alone as positive and negative controls. the same number of cells was added for the last 4 h. in vivo cytotoxicity assay mice were immunized i.m. twice 8 weeks apart with 0.1 g of SAM(NP), 0.2 g of SAM(NP)+SAM(M1) or 0.1 g of SAM(M1-NP) to prepare target cells, splenocytes from nave mice were split into two populations. one population was pulsed for 1 h at 37\u00b0C with 5 M of NP147-155 peptide (TY mice were challenged with equivalent lethal doses of PR8 (10.5 TCID50) or HK68 (1560 TCID50) mice were infected with 105 TCID50 of PR8. survival, body weight, and clinical signs of illness were monitored daily for 2 weeks after infection. RT-PCR was analyzed using the lightCycler 480 System (Roche) the viral titers were calculated using the comparative Ct method. lungs were excised at 0, 3, 6 and 17 days after challenge. protocols approved by the Italian Ministry of Health and the Novartis Vaccines Animal Welfare Body. mice were monitored daily and euthanized after exhibiting defined humane endpoints. mice were monitored daily and euthanized when they exhibited defined humane endpoints. frequencies of dsRNA+ and protein+ cells were comparable for each replicon. antigen expression paralleled RNA amplification in vitro. dsRNA+ and protein+ cells were comparable for each replicon. bicistronic SAM(M1-NP) replicons were analyzed by flow cytometry. frquency (mean SD) and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of BHK cells expressing NP or M1 antigens after transfection with the different SAM/LNP formulations. flow cytometry analysis showed that the percentage and MFI of BHK cells expressing the NP or M1 antigens after transfection with the different SAM/LNP formulations were comparable between single antigen and combination groups. infection with a low dose of the PR8 virus and treatment with PBS were used as positive and negative controls. splenocytes of immunized animals stimulated in vitro with NP147-155 peptide (a), recombinant NP protein (b) or with the M1-derived peptide pool were already detectable 10 days after the first immunization. a 10-fold increase was seen 10 days after the second immunization, with frequencies of NP-specific CD8+ T cells ranging from 1 to 2% of total CD8+ T cells and contracting to a group of mice were infected with a low dose of influenza virus PR8. p0.05 compared to SAM(NP) and SAM(M1) at all time points. no differences were observed in the frequencies of antigen-specific T-cells induced by SAM(M1) alone or in combination with SAM(NP) no differences were observed in the frequencies of antigen-specific T-cells induced by SAM(M1) or in combination with SAM(NP) low frequencies of antigen-specific TCM, TEM and TEFF cells were measured after the first immunization with all SAM vaccines. after the second immunization, the frequency of NP-specific CD8+ TCM cells was boosted up to 0.2% (Fig 3A), and some NP- and M1-specific CD4+ TCM cells were also detected. the majority of NP-specific CD8+ T cells were CD107a+. the immunization with SAM(NP) alone induced higher frequency of CD107a+ NP-specific CD8+ T cells compared to the combination vaccines. splenocytes were pulsed with the H2-Kd-restricted NP147-155 peptide (0.5 M CFSE) or with an unrelated HIV-Gag197-205 peptide (10 M CMTMR) a specific lysis of > 93% was measured in SAM(NP)-immunized mice. 74% and 60% of specific lysis were detected in SAM(NP)-immunized groups. mice were immunized i.m. twice, 8 weeks apart, with 0.1 g of SAM(NP), SAM(M1), SAM(M1-NP), or with 0.2 g of SAM(NP)+SAM(M1) vectors formulated in LNPs. survival, weight loss and clinical scores were measured for 14 days after challenge. mice were monitored for survival (a and e) body weight loss (b and f) and clinical score (c and combination with M1 and formulated with LNP were protected against lethal infection with the homologous PR8 virus. mice immunized with SAM(NP), SAM(NP)+SAM(M1) and SAM(M1-NP) vaccines had survival rates of 71, 70, and 78%. administration of the vaccine alone was poorly protective (25% survival rate) the different protective efficacy of SAM(M1) vaccine could be due to the difference in virulence of PR8 and HK68 viruses. the different protective efficacy of SAM(M1) vaccine in the homologous and heterosubtypic infection models could be due to the difference in virulence of PR8 and HK68 viruses. e produced by respective cells after in vitro stimulation with medium (m), NP147-155 peptide (NP) or M1 peptide pool (M1) for CD107a. data derived from two independent and merged experiments. at the time of influenza challenge, H2-Kd/NP147-155 pentamer+ CD8+ T cells were already detectable in the lungs of mice immunized with SAM(NP) and combinations. the characteristic CD4 Th1 profile observed after systemic immunization was maintained after infection by lung-infiltrating antigen-specific CD4+ T cells that expressed IFN- and TNF-, alone or in combination. the high number of effector CD8+ and CD4+ T cells present from day 6 onwards after influenza challenge was not inducing overt pathology but rather was associated with a low histopathological score. mice were infected with 10-fold the lethal dose of PR8 virus. mice showed a survival rate significantly increased compared to PBS treated mice with 91% and 20% respectively. all immunized animals showed signs of disease during the observation. the frequency of antigen-specific cytokine-secreting CD8+ (d) or CD4+ (e) T cells was determined by flow cytometry on splenocytes stimulated in vitro with a Cal/H1 peptide pool (d, e) or a PR8/H1 peptide pool (d, e) data are derived from two independent and merged experiments. replicons with MIIV shifted the usual Th0/Th2 profile to a Th0/Th1 profile dominated by the production of IFN-/TNF-/IL-2 and IL-2/TNF-. similar T helper pattern observed when combining SAM vectors encoding M1-NP or GFP antigens with MIIV suggests that the polarization of the T-cell response was due to the replicon per se, and was likely not antigen-dependent istronic SAM replicons was measured after electroporation in BHK cells. the presence of intracellular dsRNA molecules, as markers of RNA amplification, was evaluated. the frequencies of dsRNA+ and protein+ cells were comparable or higher than that obtained with the STD. NP- and M1-expressing BHK cells transfected with mock, SAM(NP), SAM(M1) or with the bicistronic SAM(M1-NP) replicons were analyzed by flow cytometry. compared to the SAM(NP)- or SAM(M1)-treated groups. the percentage and MFI of BHK cells expressing the NP or M1 antigens after transfection with the different SAM/LNP formulations were comparable between single antigen and combination groups. NP- and M1-specific IgG were already detectable in the sera of SAM-immunized mice after the first dose. antigen-specific, cytokine-secreting cells were identified among the CD44high CD8+ and CD4+ T cell subsets. the majority of NP-specific CD8+ T cells were IFN-+ and IFN-+/TNF-+, characteristic of an effector phenotype. no M1-specific CD8+ T-cells were detected in PR8-exposed mice and in any SAM(M1) vaccine group at any time point tested. T cells were determined by flow cytometry on splenocytes stimulated in vitro with the NP147-155 peptide (a), recombinant NP protein (b) or with the M1-derived peptide pool (c). as control, a group of mice were infected with a low dose of influenza virus PR8. M1-specific CD4+ T-cells showed kinetics and phenotype similar to NP-specific CD4+ T cells, albeit with lower frequencies. no differences were observed in frequencies of antigen-specific T-cells induced by SAM(M1) alone or in combination with SAM(NP) the frequency of NP-specific (a-b) or M1-specifc (c) cytokine-secreting cells were determined within the central memory: TCM (CD44high/CD62Lhigh/CD127high), and the effector memory: TEM (CD44high/CD62Llow/CD127high) subsets. we characterized antigen-specific T cells induced by SAM vaccines for cytotoxic activity in vitro and in vivo. cytotoxicity was evaluated by quantifying the surface expression of CD107a. the majority of NP-specific CD8+ T cells were CD107a+. the percentage of CFSE+ and CMTMR+ cells present in the spleens were measured by flow cytometry 18 h later. the percentage of CFSE+ and CMTMR+ cells present in the spleens were measured by flow cytometry 18 h later. mice were immunized i.m. twice, 8 weeks apart, with 0.1 g of SAM(NP), SAM(M1), SAM(M1-NP), or 0.2 g of SAM(NP)+SAM(M1) vectors formulated in LNPs. mice were challenged with a lethal dose of the mouse-adapted homologous PR8 or HK68 influenza virus. survival, weight loss and clinical scores were measured for 14 days after challenge. mice immunized with SAM replicons expressing NP were protected against lethal infection with the homologous PR8 virus. mice vaccinated with the NP-expressing replicons showed a more rapid recovery from disease compared to PBS-treated mice. all SAM vaccines were associated with 100% survival, reduced overall weight loss, and low clinical scores. the different protective efficacy of SAM(M1) vaccine in homologous and heterosubtypic infection models could be due to the difference in virulence of PR8 and HK68 viruses. the color code represents the different combinations of cytokine produced by the respective cells after in vitro stimulation with medium (m), NP147-155 peptide (NP) or M1 peptide pool (M1), as indicated. data derived from two independent and merged experiments. antigen-specific CD4+ T cells can also contribute to the development of the effector functions of CD8+ T cells. the characteristic CD4 Th1 profile observed after immunization was maintained after infection by lung-infiltrating antigen-specific CD4+ T cells that expressed IFN- and TNF-, alone or in combination. 0.1 g of SAM(M1-NP) or SAM(GFP) control vector in LNP combined with 0.1 g of MIIV (Cal/H1N1) were used as negative and positive control. mice were infected with 10-fold the lethal dose of PR8 virus. mice were monitored for survival (a) and body weight loss (b) for 14 days. data are derived from two separate and merged experiments. data are derived from two independent and merged experiments. compared adaptive immune responses induced by vaccine combinations. CD8+ and CD4+ T cells showed a polyfunctional effector phenotype. co-administration of SAM replicons with MIIV shifted the usual Th0/Th2 phenotype elicited by MIIV. similar T helper pattern observed when combining SAM vectors encoding M1-NP or GFP antigens with MIIV suggests that the polarization of the T-cell response was due to the replicon per se. s were immunogenic in mice, inducing NP-specific cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. mice immunized with SAM(NP) alone or in combination with M1 showed comparable survival rates. mice immunized with SAM(M1) showed T-cell responses limited to the CD4 subset. all vaccinia virus vaccines were not protected against HK68 heterosubtypic virus. cross-reactive T-cells were induced by the vaccines due to the high amino acid homology of the NP (94%) and M1 (98%) antigens between PR8 and HK68. we tested this approach by combining our lead candidate SAM(M1-NP) with MIIV. we demonstrated that this vaccination regimen induced functional antibody responses to HA and T-cell responses to NP and M1 antigens. this observation is in line with reports on the co-administration of ssRNA SAM in preclinical and clinical studies. a vaccine platform based on ssRNA viral vectors may be beneficial for the development of a broad-spectrum universal influenza vaccine. the technology combines positive immunological attributes of DNA and viral vector-based vaccines, while potentially overcoming many of their limitations. only 8 days were needed to synthesize a prototype vaccine against emerging H7N9 in response to the 2013 outbreak in china [29] Statistical analyses were performed using the Mann-Whitney U test. compared each immunization group with the PBS group for each stimulus (*) data are derived from two independent and merged experiments. Lungs were collected after infection to evaluate tissue damage. clinical scores were given for severity as follows: 0, normal lung; 1 mild and/or scattered foci of inflammation; 2 moderate and/or several foci of inflammation; 3 severe and/or diffuse inflammation.
