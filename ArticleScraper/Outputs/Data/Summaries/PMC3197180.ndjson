{"summary": "the 2009 swine flu is responsible for 274,000 hospitalizations and 12,470 deaths in the united states. the control of influenza primarily involves applying health resources to affected people, known as control strategies. the prevention of influenza emphasizes healthy people and depends on their voluntary behavior against the disease. the urbanized area of Buffalo, New York, USA, is taken as a study area. the control effectiveness with and without individual preventive behavior is compared to indicate if there exists a significant difference. cost-effective strategies are suggested based on the comparison analysis. the model involves an agent-based stochastic simulation, discrete time steps, and spatially explicit representation of individuals. each individual is a modeling unit with a set of characteristics (e.g., age, occupation, infection status, location and time of daily activities) individuals are assigned to business locations to represent their daily activities, such as working, shopping, eating out, etc. the diffusion of individual preventive behavior is propelled by two types of inter-personal influence through the contact network. the latter is represented as the proportion of influenza cases among an individual's contacts. the latter is expressed as the proportion of behavioral adopters among the contacts. Influenza control strategies Influenza control strategies are mostly applied at three levels: individual level, group level, and community level. for each level, one strategy is selected for subsequent investigation, namely a Targeted antiviral prophylaxis (TAP) strategy at the individual level, a workplace closure strategy at the group level, and a travel restriction strategy at the community level. only a proportion of influenza cases, 60% (60%TAP) and 80% (80%TAP), can be identified during a day. the workplace closure strategy shuts down a proportion of workplaces/schools where influenza cases are identified. this strategy has been suggested to be useful to socially distance individuals, delay the disease spread, and win time for developing vaccines and antiviral drugs. the cumulative number of influenza cases exceeds 1,000 (1 of the population), and last until the end of the epidemic. each strategy scenario is performed 50 realizations to reduce randomness, resulting in a total of 1,000 realizations (5 strategies2 scenarios2 models50 realizations) each simulation records the time and location of every infection event during a 150-day period. the curve depicts the number of daily new influenza cases during the course of an epidemic. the curve depicts the number of daily new cases during the course of an epidemic. the curve depicts the number of daily new influenza cases during the course of an epidemic. 0.90 Combined High+PB 0.68 [0.00, 0.91] 52 [4, 102] 0.96 a All measures are the averages of 50 model runs. the relative effectiveness with and without PB is significantly different (p-value = 0.043) an effective strategy is expected to reduce infection intensity at every location, and confine the spatial extent of affected areas. the model involves an agent-based stochastic simulation, discrete time steps, and spatially explicit representation of individuals. each individual is a modeling unit with a set of characteristics (e.g., age, occupation, infection status, location and time of daily activities) the contacts between individuals take place when individuals meet at the same time and location. the stochastic model simulates the concurrent diffusion of influenza and individual preventive behavior [23]. the preventive behavior is considered as a practice or information that also diffuses over contact networks through inter-personal influence. the diffusion of individual preventive behavior is propelled by two types of inter-personal influence through the contact network. if an individual uses antiviral drugs, the chance of being infected and infecting others can be reduced by 70% and 40%, respectively [14], [29]. if an individual uses antiviral drugs, the chance of being infected and infecting others can be reduced by 70% and 40%, respectively. only a proportion of influenza cases, 60% (60%TAP) and 80% (80%TAP), can be identified during a day. the workplace closure strategy shuts down a proportion of workplaces/schools where influenza cases are identified. this strategy has been suggested to be useful to socially distance individuals, delay the disease spread, and win time for developing vaccines and antiviral drugs. control strategies are assumed to be implemented at the time when the cumulative number of influenza cases exceeds 1,000 (1 of the population) each strategy scenario is performed 50 realizations to reduce randomness, resulting in a total of 1,000 realizations (5 strategies2 scenarios2 models50 realizations) each simulation records the time and location of every infection event during a 150-day period. the curve depicts the number of daily new influenza cases during the course of an epidemic. the curve depicts the number of daily new influenza cases during the course of an

shown in brackets. the relative effectiveness with and without PB is significantly different (p-value = 0.043) 60% TAP and 80% TAP scenario (blue curves in Figure 1A\u2013B) significantly reduces overall attack rate to 6.87% and 4.74% respectively. these two scenarios also postpone peak time by 5\u201313 days. 10% WC+PB and 33%WC+PB scenarios produce a much smaller attack rate of 3.99% and 1.83%, respectively. the time to reach epidemic peaks is shortened to 61\u201366 days. the relative effectiveness of 10% WC scenario is doubled by considering preventive behavior. the 10%TR+PB scenario produces a much better outcome than that from the 10% TR alone. overall attack rate and epidemic peak size are remarkably reduced. the 50%TR+PB scenario turns out to be effective for influenza containment, because the overall attack rate can be lowered to 1.65%. the baseline scenario (Figure 2A) induces an extremely high intensity of infections in the central business district of the study area. the infection intensity decreases in an outward direction to suburbs. the central business district has the densest residential population and highly concentrated business locations. 80% TAP scenario significantly reduces overall attack rate to 6.87% and 4.74% respectively. both 60%TAP+PB and 80%TAP+PB scenarios result in even lower attack rates around 4.3%. this is because diffusion of preventive behavior quickly exhausts the pool of susceptible individuals. 10% WC+PB and 33%WC+PB scenarios produce a much smaller attack rate of 3.99% and 1.83% respectively. the time to reach epidemic peaks is shortened to 61\u201366 days, roughly 2 weeks earlier than the baseline scenario. a 10% workplace closure strategy, instead of the 33% one, would be adequate to contain an influenza epidemic. the 10%TR+PB scenario produces a much better outcome than that from the 10% TR alone. overall attack rate and epidemic peak size are remarkably reduced. the 50%TR+PB scenario turns out to be effective for influenza containment. the baseline scenario induces an extremely high intensity of infections in the central business district of the study area. the infection intensity decreases in an outward direction to suburbs. the central business district has the densest residential population and highly concentrated business locations. this extra effectiveness produces an even smaller attack rate of influenza, lower epidemic peak, and earlier peak time. a low-level combination of the three strategies is recommended to suppress influenza epidemic in the study area, while a high-level combination is no longer a must. this research has a number of limitations. control strategies enforced by health agencies and preventive behavior voluntarily practiced by the public are two intertwined components of disease containment. it is hard to resist citing and rephrasing the argument by Funk et al. the X axis indicates the proportion of adopters in the contacts of a participant that is needed to convince the participant to adopt. the Y axis shows the frequency of such proportion occurring in the survey results."}
