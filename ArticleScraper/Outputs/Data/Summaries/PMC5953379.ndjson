{"summary": "the spectrum of diseases can be classified into three clinical manifestations according to the associated signs and symptoms (cutaneous, mucocutaneous, and visceral leishmaniasis) the disease is prevalent in 98 countries, with around 350 million people estimated to be at risk and around 12 million cases. for the diagnosis of leishmaniasis, LAMP has been used with the implementation of primers targeting the small ribosomal subunit (18S rRNA gene),10,11,23 kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) for the detection of Old World Leishmania species,24\u201326 and the Internal Transcribed Spacer 1 (ITS-1). this project has a certificate of approval from the ethics committee of the National University of Colombia, number 002-010-15. the patients included in this study signed a written informed consent. the assays were performed at a final volume of 25 L consisting of 40 pM of each internal primer forward inner primer and back inner primer, 15 pM of each external primer (F3 and B3) 2 the Loopamp DNA Amplification reaction mix from Eiken\u00ae (Ref. LMP205), 8 U of Bst DNA polymerase (Eiken, Tokyo, Japan), 0.004% malachite green, and 2 L of DNA. we performed LAMP on the DNA of six Leishmania reference strains within a single day using the conditions described earlier. we selected microorganisms that were phylogenetically related to Leishmania. five serial dilutions of each DNA of the six Leishmania species were subjected to LAMP. the amplification of each dilution was performed with eight replicates over five consecutive days. the dilution was determined using Probit Regression software. stained stained with Giemsa were immersed in Xilol for 2 seconds to remove immersion oil. the contents were transferred to a clean Eppendorf tube with the aid of a micropipette. DNA was then subjected to real-time PCR (qPCR) and LAMP. the agreement between the tests (LAMP, qPCR, and microscopy in the case of the smears) was determined by calculating the concordance percentages. the agreement between the tests (LAMP, qPCR, and microscopy in the case of the smears) was determined by calculating the concordance percentages. DNA was extracted from a stock that contained 1 105 parasite equivalents/mL. DNA obtained from each reference strain was used to perform serial dilutions from 1 104 to 1 102 parasite equivalents/mL. loop-mediated isothermal amplification assays were performed. target label Sequence 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 18S rRNA gene F3 GGGTGTTCTCCACTCCAGA B3 CCATGGCAGTCCACTACAC FIP TACTGCCAGTGAAGCTGATAGGGC LAMP = loop-mediated isothermal amplification. this describes the ability of the assay to detect the diversity of blank DNA, which in this case included six new world leishmania species associated with CL. onsecaea pedrosoi were subjected to the LAMP assay within a single day. this describes the ability of the assay to detect the diversity of blank DNA. this describes the ability of the assay to provide a negative result when closely related but non-target sample sources are tested. five serial dilutions of each DNA of the six Leishmania species were subjected to the LAMP assay. the amplification of each dilution was performed with eight replicates over five consecutive days. the LoD was determined using Probit Regression software. two sets of biological samples were used to evaluate the performance of the test. the sets of samples were selected by convenience due to the lack of studies expressing values of sensitivity and specificity for LAMP tests in leishmania. the DNA was then subjected to real-time PCR (qPCR) and LAMP. qPCR was executed using a 7,500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) qPCR was executed using a 7,500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) the rate of detection of positive samples for each test was reported in terms of the frequency and the corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI). microscopy and qPCR were considered appropriate references because they are the only tests currently available for diagnosis in practice. sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were determined using microscopy and qPCR as reference tests for the smears. these tests were considered appropriate references because they are the only tests currently available for diagnosis in practice. the main parameters used to evaluate the analytical performance of the test are described in the following paragraphs. li; 3 = Staphylococcus aureus; 4 = Streptococcus pyogenes; 5 = Histoplasma capsulatum; 6 = Sporothrix schenckii; 8 = Fonsecaea pedrosoi. anticipated reportable range determined from seven serial dilutions analyzed. using this set of smears (n = 36; 95% CI: 57.5\u201383.8) this frequency of infection was lower than that detected by molecular tests. the second set of biological samples corresponded to 50 pools of sandflies. an infection rate of 40.0% was detected (n = 20; 95% CI: 26.4\u201354.8) by the same two molecular tests. the sensitivity was lower (71.4%) compared with that of microscopy. the NPVs were 100% in all cases and the PPVs were higher than 90%. the technique was found to be unique for leishmania amplification with the 18S rRNA gene. no color was observed in any reaction tubes containing DNAs from samples with a differential diagnosis. a light blue color was observed in the reaction tubes of all samples. it was determined that the LoD was up to the 1 102 dilution (Figure 3B) the results were consistent with the ARR. the findings were concordant with those observed for the ARR and LoD. the results obtained for these two sets of samples are presented in Table 2A. the evaluated tests showed high concordance (> 90% in all cases) with high kappa coefficients. the results of comparisons are shown in Table 2B. the results of the operative capabilities of the LAMP test compared with the reference test used are described in Table 3. microscopy and qPCR Smears Sandflies Reference test Microscopy % (95% CI) qPCR % (95% CI) Sensitivity 100 (98.6\u2013100.0) 100 (98.7\u2013100.0) 100 (97.5\u2013100.0) Specificity 71.4 (44.2\u201398.7) 90.9 (69.4\u2013100.0) 96 the disadvantages presented by parasitological tests prompted the search for molecular techniques that would be effective for the diagnosis and surveillance of CL. PCR has been found to offer high sensitivity and specificity compared with traditional parasitological methods37. mondal et al.54 reported the use of a recombinant polymerase amplification assay for the detection of Leishmania donovani. this technique offers a shorter reaction time compared with LAMP. despite advances in the development of new diagnostic techniques, studies often only report certain aspects relating to the sensitivity and specificity of these techniques. a large number of microorganisms have been used to determine the exclusivity of the LAMP test. this is the first time that a large number of microorganisms have been used to determine the exclusivity of the test. the test was established to be 1 102 equivalent parasites/mL. results of the LAMP test with other tests, considered as reference tests in this study, revealed high concordance (> 90%, with kappa coefficients > 0.78) and no cases in which a positive test result was obtained for the reference test that was then found to be negative for the LAMP test. this may indicate the high analytical sensitivity of the LAMP test for the detection of Leishmania DNA. t al.10 performed a comparison of LAMP versus qPCR and PCR-RFLP. loop-mediated isothermal amplification using the Eiken fluorescent reagent cost approximately $3.5 per reaction, compared with $12 for qPCR and $2.5 for PCR."}
