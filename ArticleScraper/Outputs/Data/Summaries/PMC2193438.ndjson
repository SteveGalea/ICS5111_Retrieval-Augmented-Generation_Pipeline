{"summary": "NK cells represent up to 15% of peripheral blood lymphocytes and can reach high concentrations at sites of inflammation. despite their discovery 25 yr ago, convincing evidence for their importance has only been established in a limited number of systems 1. they may need the capacity to selectively recognize and attack infected host cells or else to nonselectively respond to stimuli. NK cells regulate MCMV infection by different preferred mechanisms in different organs. cytotoxic mechanism regulates MCMV in the spleen than in the liver. no NK cell subset has ever been shown to selectively regulate the synthesis of a virus or any other pathogen in vivo. each NK cell expresses several different types of Ly49 molecules. no selective role for either subset could be shown in the control of infection 22. mice depleted of NK subsets in vivo with mAb tended to be just as resistant to MCMV as untreated mice. the Smith strain of MCMV was propagated in vivo in salivary glands of Balb/c mice 14. mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with 3 103 to 2 104 plaque-forming units (PFUs) of MCMV, as titrated on mouse embryonic fibroblast monolayers. mAb 1F8 does not recognize Ly49 A, D, or G2. limitations of this mAb are its cross-reactivity with Ly49 C and I. mAb 5E6 reacts with Ly49 C and I, but not H. MCMV titers indistinguishable from inoculations with mAb to Ly49A, D, G2, or C/I 22. peritoneal cells were isolated by lavaging the peritoneal cavity with 10 ml of RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies) isotype control mouse (m) IgG2a-FITC (BD PharMingen), isotype control rat (r) IgG2a-FITC (BD PharMingen), anti-Ly49D-FITC (BD PharMingen), anti-Ly49D-FITC (a gift from Dr. John Ortaldo, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD), anti-Ly49G2-FITC (BD PharMingen), anti 60\u201380,000 events were calculated, ensuring a sizable NK cell population for a valid analysis of NK subsets. most experiments used 5\u201310-wk-old C57BL/6J (H2b) male mice. most experiments used 5\u201310-wk-old C57BL/6J (H2b) male mice. mAb 1F8 was prepared while attempting to generate an Ly49C-specific mAb. the amino acid sequences of Ly49 C, I, and H differ significantly from other Ly49 molecules 26. mAb 1F8 does not recognize Ly49 A, D, or G2. mice were depleted of NK cells by a single intraperitoneal inoculation of 25\u2013200 g of column-purified mAb 1F8 6\u201324 h before infection with virus. mice were inoculated with 100 l PBS containing 200 g of mAb 5E6, which recognizes Ly49 C/I, or with a dose of mAb to NK1.1 (PK136) titrated to eliminate LCMV-induced NK cell one million cells were cultured in Falcon 96-well plates (Becton Dickinson) with RPMI media (Life Technologies) containing GolgiPlug (BD PharMingen) at 0.2 l per sample in the presence or absence of 50 ng/ml PMA (Sigma-Aldrich) and 500 ng/ml ionomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 4 h at 37\u00b0C. samples were stained with rat IgG1-APC mAb to mouse IFN- (BD PharMingen) or with a control rat IgG1-APC (BD PharMingen) for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. samples were then washed twice using perm/wash and once using FACS\u00ae buffer before being transferred to tubes for analysis on either a FACS\u00ae 440 (Becton Dickinson) NK 1.1 is a more specific NK cell marker, particularly when used on lymphocyte-gated cells that fail to stain with anti-NK1 and anti-CD3. each virus stimulated an increase in the total number and percentage of NK cells in the liver. we questioned whether commercially available Abs to Ly49 molecules could detect qualitative differences in NK cell responses between organs and between viruses. the first conclusion is that only a low percentage of resident NK cells in the liver before infection expressed these Ly49 antigens, with exception of Ly49 C/I. 2+ and Ly49C/I+ liver NK cells were about equal after VV infection. these subtle differences suggest some selectivity in the NK cell responses to different viruses. each of these viruses activated NK cell populations and stimulated redistribution. it is only MCMV that has been consistently shown to be highly regulated by NK cells 12 13 14 16 17 32. NK cells from the highly sensitive Balb/c strain stained with 5E6. but did not express the Ly49H subset, as defined by 1F8+5E6cells. expression of Ly49H on NK cells from different strains of mice. the 5E61F8+ cells are presumed to express Ly49H but not Ly49 C or I. mAb 1F8+5E6+ cells were stained with mAb 5E6 and 1F8. otype controls for anti-IFN- mAb used in every assay were run to ensure that synthesis of IFN- was observed. splenocytes from day 2 MCMV-infected mice were a source of IFN-\u2013producing cells. mAb did not block the ability of (nonNK cell splenocytes to synthesize intracellular TNF-. NK1.1+CD3 splenocytes spontaneously producing IFN- after MCMV infection were 34 16%. in 16 experiments the average in the PECs was 35 13%. in six experiments with liver leukocytes the average number was 42 14%. NK cells reacting with mAb 1F8 showed virtually no (1%) reactivity. 1F8 cells tend to be very poor at IFN- production in those compartments. spleen NK cell subsets stained with 5E6 and 1F8 Abs. it shows that the 5E61F8+ staining population, presumably those expressing Ly49 H, were preferentially enriched in their production of IFN-. over 80% of the IFN-\u2013producing splenocytes and PECs in this experiment expressed reactivity with the 1F8 mAb. these experiments suggest that the Ly49H subset may be particularly effective at making IFN- after MCMV infection. LCMV and MHV induced higher levels of 1F8+5E6 (Ly49H)-positive cells in the PECs and liver by 3 d after infection. thus, this NK cell subset, presumed to be Ly49H+, appeared to respond well to all tested virus infections. NK cells from mice treated with the type I IFN inducer and NK cell activator poly I:C stimulated strong NK cell responses. NK cells from MCMV-infected but not LCMV-infected mice produce IFN-. this has been linked to differences in IL-12 production 35. the percentage of cells synthesizing IFN- within the total NK cell population can be calculated by summing the values of each of the paired samples. the percentage of cells synthesizing IFN- within the total NK cell population can be calculated by summing the values of each of the paired samples. a second experiment with LCMV, MHV, and VV similarly showed a preponderance in IFN- responsiveness within the cell populations defined by mAb 1F8. the results suggest that the propensity of the 1F8+ cells to proportionally dominate the IFN- response is profound but not specific to a given virus. mice were inoculated with mAb to deplete various NK cell subsets. mAb 1F8 treatment caused only a marginal (30%) reduction in total spleen NK cell number 1 d after treatment. mice treated with mAb 1F8 and then infected with LCMV had nearly identical levels of NK cell cytotoxicity against YAC-1 cells. mice treated with mAb to 1F8 and then challenged with the IFN-inducer poly I:C had levels of NK cell activity similar to untreated mice 3 d after LCMV infection mAb 1F8 does not interfere with staining with mAb 5E6. further, the enrichment in the Ly49G2 subset is another indicator that the 1F8+ subset is lost. this figure does illustrate how different NK cell subsets compensate for the deletion of others. treatment with mAb 1F8 resulted in >100-fold increases in MCMV titers in the spleen and eightfold increases in the liver. treatment with mAb 5E6 did not significantly elevate spleen titers, confirming previous report 22.

MHV titers were not examined in mAb 1F8-treated mice. there has been considerable interest in the potential role of T cells expressing NKRs in controlling infections and modulating host responses. NK1.1+CD3+ (NK/T) lymphocytes were analyzed for coexpression of Ly49 molecules before and after infection. NK/T cells reacted with mAb 5E6 (Ly49 C/I) and mAb 1F8 (Ly49 C/I/H) but very few NK/T cells displayed the Ly49H phenotype of 1F8+5E6. this pattern was seen in spleen, PECs, and the 5E6 mAb should deplete virtually all of the 1F8+ NK/T cells in vivo. prototypical NK1.1+CD3 NK cells from the spleens of uninfected mice and NK1.1+CD3+ NK/T cells from the livers of uninfected mice were costained with mAb to 1F8 (Ly49C/I/H) true NK cell population were also noted in LCMV, VV, and MHV infections. the experiment showed enhanced MCMV synthesis in mAb 1F8-treated T cell KO mice. the NK cell response against MCMV, MHV, and a disseminating strain of LCMV (clone 13) was examined initially during the first 3 d of infection of C57BL/6 mice. NK cells migrate into areas of virus infection and undergo division in those areas 28 29 30. NK cells migrate into areas of virus infection and undergo division in those areas 28 29 30. all four viruses induced drops in Ly49C percentages in the spleen and rise in the PECs. the ratio of Ly49G2+ to Ly49C/I+ liver NK cells at 3 d after infection was high (often >2:1) after infection was high (often >2:1) after infection with MCMV, LCMV, or MHV, but the frequencies of Ly49G2+ and Ly49C/I+ liver NK cells were about equal after V mAb 1F8, recognizing Ly49H, cross-reacting with Ly49 C and I, molecules detected by the 5E6 mAb. resistance of mice to MCMV is very dependent on their genetic background 7. mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with MCMV and examined for the accumulation of NK cell subsets costaining with mAb 1F8. a high proportion of the NK cells infiltrating the MCMV-infected liver by day 2 stained with mAb 1F8 but not 5E6, suggesting that this was indeed an infiltration by Ly49H+ cells. 5E61F8+ cells are presumed to express Ly49H but not Ly49 C or I. significant proportions of the NK cells spontaneously produce intracellular IFN- if allowed to incubate in the milieu of leukocytes from virus-infected tissue. with 0.8 g/ml IFN- during the IFN- assay reduced the frequency of IFN- staining from 20 to 7.5, and reduced the mean fluorescent intensity of the remaining positive cells from 736 to 473. we examined IFN-\u2013producing NK cells over the first 3 d of MCMV infection and found a sharp peak of production at 2 d after infection, in agreement with other publications using different types 18. mAb 1F8 was costained with mAb 5E6 and 1F8 and tested for IFN- production. cells staining with mAb 1F8 accounted for much higher proportions of IFN-\u2013producing cells than cells not reacting with mAb 1F8 in either the spleen or PECs. in all technically satisfactory experiments studied, however, IFN- production was substantially enriched in the 1F8+ (seven experiments) and in the 1F8+5E6 (five experiments) NK cell populations, particularly in contrast to the populations not staining with 5E6 or 1F8. additional experiments were done to determine whether there was enrichment for IFN- production in NK cells expressing other Ly49 antigens. in other experiments we tested Ly49A+ and A cells, finding no proportion Isotype controls for the IFN- Ab were 1%, as seen in Fig. 4. we tested whether the profound stimulation of Ly49H+ cells was unique to MCMV or whether it was a general property of viral infections. in one experiment, 17% of the resident PEC NK cells were 1F8+ 5E6, and this increased to 36, 35, and 40% by 2 d after infection. Isotype control mAb staining for mAb to IFN- (rIgG1-APC) and mAb 1F8 (rIgG2a-FITC) for NK1.1+CD3\u2013gated lymphocytes from the same mice. MCMV elicited more spontaneous IFN- production from spleen, PECs, and liver NK cells at 2 d after infection. 1F8+ IF8 (%) 5E6+ 5E6 (%) Exp. 1 MCMV Spleen 34 21 (62) 27 28 (49) PECs 25 8.8 (74) 16 19 (46) LCMV-C113 Spleen 6.7 1.2 (85) 3.8 3.2 (54) PECs 13 0.9 (94) 9.4 3.6 (72) LCMC-Arm Spleen 6.2 2.0 (76) 3.7 0.7 (71) PECs 13 1.5 (90) 11 the percentage of cells synthesizing IFN- within the total NK cell population can be calculated by summing the values of each of the paired samples. we questioned whether the IFN-\u2013producing NK cells elicited by these different viruses were also biased in their expression of 1F8. mice were inoculated with mAb to Ly49 molecules in order to deplete various NK cell subsets. a substantial proportion of the spleen NK cells initially react with mAb 1F8 before infection, but this is no higher than those expressing Ly49G2 or combinations of two of the other Abs. treatment of four naive mice in two experiments with 200 g of mAb 1F8 resulted in 50% reduction in total spleen NK cell mice were treated in vivo with mAb 1F8 (C/I/H) or 5E6 (C/I), infected with MCMV. mAb 5E6 eliminated the 5E6+1F8+ NK cell subset. mAb 1F8 eliminated both the 5E6+ and 1F8+ cells, but enriched for the G2+ cells. mAb 1F8 inoculation into irradiated (C57BL/6 DBA/2) host mice did not inhibit their ability to reject C57BL/6 bone marrow cell grafts. this means that many NK cell functions remain intact in mice depleted of 1F8+ NK cells. treatment with mAb 5E6 did not significantly elevate spleen titers. treatment with mAb 1F8 is compared with mAb to NK 1.1, which depletes virtually all NK cells. a total of seven experiments showed elevated MCMV titers in mAb 1F8-treated mice. a total of seven experiments showed elevated MCMV titers in mAb 1F8-treated mice. maB 1F8 3.8 0.2 4.2 0.2 5 MCMV T cell KO 1.9 0.9 2.7 0.7 T cell plus mAb 1F8 3.8 0.4 3.2 0.2 6 Vaccinia Control Day 4 1.0 0.0 2.6 0.5 mAb 1F8 (C/I/H) 1.0 0.0 2.5 0.4 7 LCMV Control Day 4 4.8 0.1 not done mAb 1F8 (C/I/H 4.5 0.5 not done in each of the seven experiments, elevated pathology was observed in MCMV-infected mice depleted of 1F8+ cells. the designation means that at least one mouse had undetectable viral titers. infected mice treated with mAb 5E6 showed a greater number of white necrotic foci on their surfaces. MCMV-infected control mice tended to have mostly discrete small inflammatory infiltrates around hepatocytes displaying pyknotic nuclei and cell-rounding characteristic of MCMV infection. large areas of necrosis, particularly near the surface of the liver and easily distinguished by the naked eye, were characteristic of the MCMV infection in mAb 1F8-treated mice. LCMV is very resistant to NK cells 36, and the sensitivity of VV to NK cells can be obscured by presence of T cells or by rapid stimulation of memory T cells 24 31. in six experiments with MHV, treatment with anti-NK1.1 only led to small increases in the titers of MHV in the liver. NK/T cells were declining dramatically in the peritoneal cavity. some of this apparent decline could be an artifact due to downmodulation of NK1.1 and CD3. NK/T cells showed the Ly49H phenotype of 1F8+5E6. this pattern was seen in spleen, PECs, and liver from both uninfected and infected mice. data for NK1.1+CD3+ NK/T cells from uninfected spleens, where there is very little contamination from NK/T cells. NK/T cells accounted for 5% of the IFN-\u2013producing NK1.1+ cells in the spleen, PECs, or liver 2 d after MCMV infection. prototypical NK1.1+CD3 true NK cells accounted for >95% of the IFN-\u2013producing cells within the entire leukocyte population at 2 d after infection. depletion of no other two or even four Ly49-expressing subsets gave comparable results 22. the mechanism of NK cell subset recognition of allografts is clarifying, at least in some aspects. recently we have shown that NK cells lacking inhibitory receptors but expressing allo-MHC positive-signaling receptors are most effective at eliciting graft rejection 40. MCMV induces more IL-12, which in turn, enables NK cells to produce more IFN- 35 41. a strong indicator that an NK cell subset may be important in a viral infection in vivo has been the mapping of genetic resistance to the Cmv-1 locus. replication in the liver is controlled by IFN-, whereas replication in the spleen is controlled primarily by a perforin-dependent mechanism, suggesting cytotoxicity 18 19. we presume that those 1F8+ NK cells also have cytolytic activity. the 1F8 mAb cross-reacts with another as yet undefined Ly49 molecule mapping within the region where Cmv-1 may lie. the influence of Cmv-1 is not strongly dependent on an MHC allotype. MCMV remains, at least in our hands, the virus whose control is most dependent on NK cells. MCMV seemed to provide a much greater stimulus than the other viruses. but there is little question that highly active IFN-\u2013producing 1F8+ NK cell populations were at the sites of infection of all of those viruses. the control of those infections is efficiently compensated by another effector system providing innate immunity."}
