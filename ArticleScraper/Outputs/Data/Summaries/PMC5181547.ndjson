{"summary": "big data can be used more broadly to refer to advanced analytical methods, no matter the size, type, or form. one important feature of big data resides in \u201cinflation\u201d that is, the relative size increase of data over what is typical. a revolution in the area of social sciences and public health has always been surveillance systems tracking diseases, pathogens, and clinical outcomes. a new era fortunately seems to be dawning in which surveillance systems are strengthened by big-data streams, including electronic health (e-health) patient records, and non-traditional digital data sources, such as social media, internet, mobile phones, and remote sensing. for this special issue, we invited a group of multidisciplinary experts to reflect on the recent achievements of big data for infectious disease surveillance and modeling. the nine articles in this issue propose ways to advance monitoring, inference, and forecasting of disease outbreaks and transmission patterns. the nine articles in this issue propose ways to advance monitoring, inference, and forecasting of disease outbreaks and transmission patterns. participants can report from populations who would not otherwise seek medical care for illnesses they perceive as minor, particularly adults with influenza-like illnesses. a key advantage of participatory systems is to report from populations who would not otherwise seek medical care for illnesses they perceive as minor, particularly adults with influenza-like illnesses. analysis of internet and social media data streams could complement fda's Sentinel initiative. public-generated digital data can also be mined for information on behavior and sentiments, so as to monitor vaccine hesitancy and drug uptake. authors also stress a conceptual chasm between classic epidemiology and the world of big data, related to the notion of sampling. there is a lack of effort to conduct proper sampling and address issues of representativeness and coverage in big data, while ensuring confidentiality of individual cases. research directly connecting cell-phone movements and disease data is in its early phase. but two successful examples are worth noting, both set in Kenya. these include studies of how population movements can help dissect the source-sink spatial dynamics of malaria and how seasonal fluctuations in travel drive rubella epidemics. big data streams can improve timeliness, spatial and temporal resolution. these streams can also go beyond disease surveillance and provide information on behaviors and outcomes related to vaccine or drug use. but the promise of these big-data streams must be balanced by caution. e-health data to improve timeliness, accuracy, and depth of existing surveillance indicators. a key advantage of participatory systems is to report from populations who would not otherwise seek medical care for illnesses they perceive as minor. ad-hoc definition of cohorts of users specific to a particular health issue. a similar argument could be made for tracking of vaccine-related adverse events. public-generated digital data can also be mined for information on behavior and sentiments. an important challenge is to find balance between timeliness of social media information and the cost of unfounded alerts. authors also stress a conceptual chasm between classic epidemiology and the world of big data, related to the notion of sampling. there is a lack of effort to conduct proper sampling and address issues of representativeness and coverage in big data, in contrast to the long history of developing sampling theories. research directly connecting cell-phone movements and disease data is in its early phase, but two successful examples are worth noting, both set in Kenya. these include studies of how population movements can help dissect the source-sink spatial dynamics of malaria and how seasonal fluctuations in travel drive rubella epidemics. epiDMS provides an interface to facilitate interpretation and visualization of large numbers of multivariate simulations. this tool would allow public health experts to identify a set of conditions consistent with a given epidemic trajectory (eg, a decline of 50% in transmission) such simulation tools can provide crucial actionable data for public health experts and modelers. many of these data streams lack demographic information, such as age and sex. there is geographic heterogeneity in coverage, with underrepresentation in developing countries. tools of big data are blind to important animal epidemics and zoonotic diseases at the human-animal interface. a substantial advantage of social media over observational surveillance is the possibility to conduct experiments to study contagion phenomenas. the field is certainly far from the consolidated state of the art we find in other scientific disciplines such as weather forecasting. the ongoing big data revolution should remedy the sparseness of existing epidemiological observations. validation and integration with existing systems is key requirement of any new system. sensitivity of big-data surveillance should be tested against known associations. sensitivity of big-data surveillance should be tested against known associations. big data could be combined with veterinary or agricultural reports on recent animal disease outbreaks. data volume and forecasting horizontal should remedy the pitfalls of big data hubris. the last 10 years have seen dramatic advances in data collection and digitalization, finally allowing the construction of a portfolio of data-driven epidemiological models. predicting the emergence of new infectious diseases is a much more complex goal and will require further research on disease dynamics in zoonotic reservoirs."}
