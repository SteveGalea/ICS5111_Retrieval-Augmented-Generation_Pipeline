{"summary": "PRV-associated respiratory infections may be prevalent in Southeast Asia. the clinical course of PRV is not fully elucidated. virulence, pathology, and pathogenesis of two PRV strains were investigated. the presence of PRV cases in Southeast Asia suggests that PRV might be the causative viral pathogen of RTI. the prevalence of human PRV infection in Southeast Asia may be higher than previously thought. PRV-neutralizing antibodies were also detected in 83% of fruit bat species (R. amplexicaudatus, E. spelaea, and Macroglossus minimus) in the Philippines. it is still not known whether PRV causes illnesses in fruit bats. bat-borne PRV is a potentially pathogenic to humans.

LLC.) the qRT-PCRs were performed using a Light Cycler 96 system (Roche Diagnostics, Ltd.) two mice were intranasally inoculated with 1.0 106 PFU of the PRV-MB strain or of PRV-Samal-24 strain. organs (the head including the brain and the nasal cavity, trachea, lung, liver, kidney, and intestine) were collected. each organ collected was immediately submerged in DMEM-2FBS. tissues were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for histopathology. sections were deparaffinized by placing them in a retrieval solution (pH 6) followed by heat-treatment with an autoclave at 121\u00b0C for 10 min. the peroxidase activity was detected with 3, 3\u2019-diaminobenzidine (Sigma-Aldrich Co. LLC.) mice were intranasally inoculated with either DMEM-2FBS containing 1.0 103 PFU (non-lethal dose) of PRV-MB. mice that showed >25% initial body weight loss were euthanized. five mice per group were intranasally infected with 1.0 105 PFU of PRV-MB. then the diluent of the serum (100 L) was administered once daily. the mice that showed >25% initial body weight loss were euthanized. V strain Miyazaki-Bali/2007 (PRV-MB) was isolated from a patient with PRV infection. nucleotide sequences of the 10 segments of each of these two PRV strains are deposited in GenBank (Table 1). the supernatant was overlaid onto 20% sucrose in a 50 ml tube. the concentrated viruses were dissolved with DMEM with 2% FBS and 1% Pen-Strep. the aliquots were stored at -80\u00b0C until use. mice were intranasally inoculated with 20 l DMEM-2FBS. the mice were sacrificed on the 5th or 6th day post-infection. blood samples were collected from the mice (5 per group) infected with each strain. total RNA was extracted using Isogen (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) the forward and reverse primers and probe were specifically designed according to the nucleotide sequence of the outer-capsid protein (OCP) region in the S4 segment of PRV-MB or to that of PRV-Samal-24. sequences of the forward primer, the reverse primer, and the probe for the amplification of the PRV-MB genome were 5\u2019-CAATTTCCACTCG the standard controls for PRV-MB and PRV-Samal-24 were 10-fold serial dilutions of the plasmid DNA containing the S4 segments of PRV-MB and PRV-Samal-24. the viral copy numbers were calculated as the ratio of the copy numbers of each standard control. the viral RNA detection limits in the blood, trachea, and other tissues were determined to be 2.5 103 copies/ml, 1.6 103\u20135.0 103 copies/0.1 mice intranasally infected with 1.0 103 PFU of PRV-MB (PRV-MB-1.0103 PFU mice) and those intranasally infected with 1.0 105 PFU of PRV-MB (PRV-MB-1.0105 PFU mice) were sacrificed by exposure to excess isoflurane. pathological analyses of the lungs were performed by immunohistochemical analysis. mice inoculated with mock solution (mock-mouse-lung) were tested by IHC analysis. the samples showed a negative reaction in the IHC analysis. the positive signals detected in the IHC analysis indicate the presence of the OCP of PRV. mice were intranasally inoculated with 1.0 103 PFU of PRV-MB. the mice were then intranasally inoculated with 1.0 105 PFU of PRV-MB. on the 5th day after the third inoculation, the mice were sacrificed and blood was collected by cardiac puncture. all of the animals infected with PRV were handled in biosafety level 3 animal facilities. the mice were inoculated with virus solution under proper anesthesia. a humane endpoint was introduced for all mice with >25% initial body weight loss. the level of viral RNA in the lungs (average level, 6.9 108 copies/0.1 g) was higher than those in the other organs. viral RNA was not detected in the brain, heart, liver, spleen, kidney, and intestine. the titer in the lungs was the highest among the organs tested. the PRV antigen-positive lesions revealed in the IHC analysis by using the OCP antibody showed negative reaction in the IHC analysis using NRS. no pathological changes or viral antigens were detected in the other tissues examined. the black arrows in the upper and lower panels indicate neutrophils and type II pneumocytes. the scale bars in (B) indicate 20 m. viral RNA in the lungs of the PRV-MB-1.0103 PFU mice was determined. PRV-MB caused extensive and massive pulmonary infection in the PRV-MB-1.0105 PFU mice. no viral antigens were detected in the bronchial epithelium of the PRV-MB-1.0103 PFU mice on the 1st, 3rd, and 5th DPI. the lungs from the PRV-MB-1.0105 PFU mice were obtained on the 1st DPI. the lungs were H&E stained and tested immunohistochemically using the OCP antibody. the lower panels show enlarged views of areas of interesting lesions. administration of antiserum to mice infected with 1.0 105 PFU of PRV-MB showed a protective effect. survival rate of the anti-serum-treated mice was 60%, whereas all of the control mice died by the 6th DPI. the intranasal inoculation of the mice with PRV-Samal-24 led to fatal outcomes. viral RNA was detected in the lungs of the mice infected with PRV-Samal-24. viral RNA copy numbers were up to 3.7 108 copies/0.1 g on average. the organs were obtained from the PRV-Samal-24-1.0106 PFU mice on the 4th DPI (2 mice per group). pathological examination of the PRV-Samal-24-1.0106 PFU mice revealed inflammatory lesions in the lungs. viral antigens were also detected, especially from the bronchioles to the alveoli. c mice intranasally inoculated with 1.0 103\u20131.0 106 PFU of PRV-MB. level of viral RNA in the lungs was higher than those in the other organs. viral RNA was not detected in the brain, heart, liver, spleen, kidney, and intestine. the PRV antigen-positive lesions revealed in the IHC analysis by using the OCP antibody showed negative reaction in the IHC analysis using NRS. no pathological changes or viral antigens were detected in the other tissues examined. the scale bars in A (upper panels) indicate 200 m, whereas those in A (middle panels) indicate 20 m. the black arrows in the upper and lower panels indicate neutrophils and type II pneumocytes respectively. viral antigens were detected in the bronchial epithelium of the PRV-MB-1.0105 PFU mice on the 1st, 3rd, and 5th DPI. no viral antigens were detected in the bronchial epithelium of the PRV-MB-1.0103 PFU mice on the 1st, 3rd, and 5th DPI. the scale bars in the upper and lower panels indicate 200 m and 20 m respectively. the lungs from the PRV-MB-1.0105 PFU mice were obtained on the 1st DPI. the lower panels show enlarged views of areas of interesting lesions. infection with 1.0 105 PFU of PRV-MB on 35th day after first inoculation (5 mice per group) error bars indicate standard error. survival rate of anti-serum-treated mice was 60%, whereas control mice died. the LD50 of PRV-Samal-24 for BALB/c mice was determined to be 4.2 103 PFU/head. viral RNA was detected in the lungs of the mice infected with PRV-Samal-24. the infectious dose of PRV-Samal-24 was highest in the lungs. the organs were obtained from the PRV-Samal-24-1.0106 PFU mice on the 4th DPI (2 mice per group) pathological examination revealed inflammatory lesions in the lungs. viral antigens were also detected, especially from the bronchioles to the alveoli. mmalian orthoreovirus is classified to the genus Orthoreovirus in the family Reoviridae. it was reported to replicate in type I pneumocytes and was shown to induce severe pneumonia in some rodent species. it is possible that PRV causes more severe infections than have previously been reported. the early initiation of antiserum treatment was effective in the treatment of lethal PRV infection. the pathogenicity of PRV-Samal-24 was evaluated in this mouse model. PRV-Samal-24 caused viremia and respiratory disease. immunocompetent mice were sensitive to PRV when the mice were infected with PRV intranasally. this model might be useful for analyzing the pathogenicity of PRV in mice. the black boxes in the upper panels were shown at higher magnification. the lower panels indicate the bronchiolar epithelial cell necrosis. the scale bars in the upper panels indicate 500 m."}
