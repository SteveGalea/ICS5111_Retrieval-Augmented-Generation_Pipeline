{"summary": "a survey of 400 college students revealed that 46.7% of the sample did not engage in vigorous physical activity, and 16.7% were physically inactive (10). this population may not be aware of the increased risk for type 2 diabetes that results from their lifestyle (e.g., unhealthy food and beverage choices and reduced levels of physical activity) a dearth of research has been proposed to identify sex-related differences in risk perception of type 2 diabetes onset among college students. it has been reported that women who have family members or friends with diabetes have a greater perceived risk for the disease. only a family history of diabetes contributes to greater perceived risk for men (19) a second research question sought to identify whether there is a difference in risk perception of developing type 2 diabetes in their lifetime. the study was conducted at a university located in Walker County, Tex. possible answers were: \"I am at great risk of developing type 2 diabetes,\" \"I am at some risk of developing type 2 diabetes,\" and \"I am at no risk of developing type 2 diabetes\" participants asked to provide their age, height, weight, and information about their family history of diabetes. data were collected on participants\u2019 sex, ethnicity, and age. ethnicity was defined as Caucasian, African American, Hispanic, Asian or South Pacific Islander, Middle Eastern, American Indian/Alaskan Native. a 2 test was conducted to test the first hypothesis that more college students think their peers are at risk for type 2 diabetes onset than believe they are themselves at risk. the majority of students (68%) thought their peers were at risk than believed they were themselves at risk. more than half (69%) of excluded students were Caucasian, 16.3% were African American, 0.7% were Asian or South Pacific Islander, 0.7% were American Indian/Alaska Native, and 3.3% were of other ethnic or racial backgrounds. an analysis of variance was conducted with the remaining 302 participants to test for sex-related differences. study investigated associations among unrealistic optimism, sex, and risk perception of type 2 diabetes onset in college students. results showed a greater number of students who thought their peers have a higher risk of type 2 diabetes in their lifetime indicated the presence of unrealistic optimism in the sample. majority of these participants (64%) were female, and 35% of participants who did not know whether they are at risk were classified as overweight, obese class 1, obese class 2 or extremely obese. diabetes prevention messages may need to be tailored specifically for individuals who have no, low, or high levels of risk perception. sex-specific education programs should be developed and implemented for college students. sex-specific education programs should be developed for college students. the findings set the stage for a deeper understanding of how risk perception can affect lifestyle change among college-aged individuals. this study also provides a reason to intervene to educate college-aged students who are not familiar with their own risk or with the contributing factors to risk for developing type 2 diabetes. future research should focus on lifestyle-based risk factors in addition to risk perceptions and sex-specific influences."}
