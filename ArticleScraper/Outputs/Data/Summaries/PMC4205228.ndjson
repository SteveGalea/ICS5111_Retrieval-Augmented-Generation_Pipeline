{"summary": "the use of Twitter in emergency response operations provides an unmatched source of on-the-ground situational awareness. the open flow of information from local government officials, news outlets, and local residents has helped to change emergency response operations and communications. the US Department of health and human services started monitoring Twitter for situational awareness in 2009 during the H1N1 influenza pandemic. the first way is by following long-term trends to identify spikes in Twitter conversation that might indicate an emerging public health concern. the second way is by following long-term trends to identify spikes in conversation that might indicate an emerging public health concern. an estimated $50 billion in damage was inflicted in the US. the storm caused 147 direct deaths, 72 of which occurred in the mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions of the US. the storm required a substantial emergency response for HHS. ASPR stopped daily monitoring of Twitter for public health situational awareness related to superstorm Sandy on December 13, 2012. on November 17, 2012, monitoring was scaled back to regular working hours and daily situational awareness reports were reduced to once a day. the EEI categories listed in Table 1 were selected for monitoring on twitter. they were top priorities that had been reported on social media channels. status of critical infrastructure (i.e., hospitals, nursing homes, mental health clinics) Status of shelters Property damage in affected area. the only use of a Twitter list would result in a search that was too broad. using only Boolean searches would lead to results that are too narrowly focused. a pre-made list for an emergency response would focus on one to two major geographic areas. twitter accounts from states north of Connecticut were culled from the list. in the first 24 to 48 hours post-landfall, the number of accounts included on the Twitter list from each of these states grew rapidly. if a local news station already included on the list retweeted a reporter, that reporter would be added to the list. the Twitter list was thinned to remove accounts that were no longer reporting Sandy-related information regularly. when HHS ASPR ceased Twitter monitoring for Sandy, the list consisted of 77 accounts representing the various categories depicted in Table 2. initial Boolean searches created for the HHS Superstorm Sandy response focused on six general areas of concern from the EEIs. the boolean searches were edited to account for over-tweeted information or news. the hospital search was adjusted to exclude the terms most commonly used in the tweets referring to this incident. as the storm weakened, Twitter users referred to the storm less by name. the use of \u201cSandy\u201d and \u201cHurricane\u201d spiked very quickly on October 29th, the day of landfall, but almost as quickly began to decrease in use. changes needed to be made to searches to account for the evolving Twitter discussion and to reflect how people now referred to the event. the two-prong strategy involved significant flexibility and adaptation. a total of 20 Boolean searches followed regularly with additional ad-hoc searches created as needed for further information. the use of this prong of the strategy resulted in the flagging of multiple EEI events during the Sandy response. the Twitter list was used as a wide net to monitor overall community health in the days, weeks, and months following the storm. a local newspaper tweeted a report of an outbreak of norovirus at an evacuee shelter. this was the first report ASPR retrieved from Twitter regarding gastrointestinal illness outbreaks. the rise in popularity of graphic design and photo editing programs has led to an increase in visual rumormongering. the rise in popularity of graphic design and photo editing programs has led to an increase in visual rumormongering. a review of past tweets sent by the user was not performed. overdependence on Boolean searches could lead to the exclusion of certain tweets that may contain important information not included in the search terminology. the search,(sandy OR hurricane) AND hospital, is made unique enough by the term hospital to filter out a majority of Sandy related tweets. staff limitations were a factor for Twitter monitoring during superstorm Sandy. emergency managers report shortages of personnel as number one reason why local agencies do not incorporate social media in their emergency management activities. the use of a targeted Twitter list can help to overcome this hurdle. this information can often be used to guide what additional Boolean searches should be created to fish for individual tweets that provide additional details. each disaster presents its own unique hazards and challenges."}
