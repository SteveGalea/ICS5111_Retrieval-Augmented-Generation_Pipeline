{"summary": "Background Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a fatal disease caused by feline coronavirus (FCoV) a baculovirus-expressed type-specific domain of the spike proteins of FCoV was used to survey the infection of the two viruses over the past eight years in Taiwan. avirus 229E (HCoV 229E), FCoV is classified into the genus Alphacoronavirus[1]. the latter causes mild enteric infections, and the latter causes a fatal immune-mediated disease known as FIP [2]. specific partial S protein-based immunofluorescence assay (IFA) was established to distinguish between the two serotypes of FCoV. the correlation between the genotypes and serotypes of FCoV infection was assessed. plasma samples from 43 pathologically confirmed, naturally occurring FIP cases and 30 suspected FIP cases were further tested. samples from 760 clinically healthy cats were collected around the island of Taiwan from 1996\u20132013. an ethical approval was not required as this study was performed retrospectively. the cat was considered to be infected with FCoV. positive samples were further serotyped. a region specific to the two types of FCoV was chosen. transfect Sf-9 cells to obtain r-viruses (rFCoV-I and rFCoV-II) at different MOI values. cells were infected with either rFCoV-I or rFCoV-II at different MOI values. cell pellets from different post-infection times were lysed for Western blotting analysis. FCoV-positive sera collected from cats without FIP were diluted 1:100. two sera from specific pathogen-free cats were used as negative-control sera. serotype of each FCoV infection was identified based on rFCoV-I or rFCoV-II-infected Sf-9 cells (rRBD-1 and rRBD-II) the cells were cultured in suspension at 27\u00b0C at densities ranging from 0.5-2 106 cells/ml in HyQ SFX-Insect Media (HyClone, Logan, UT, USA) containing 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 10 g/ml gentamicin. plasma samples from 760 clinically healthy cats were collected around the island of Taiwan from 1996\u20132013. all samples were stored at 20\u00b0C until analysis. a type II FCoV-based IFA was used in the present study. a region specific to the two types of FCoV was chosen for analysis. the type I FCoV strain NTU2 and the type II FCoV strain NTU156 were employed in this study. infected cells were infected with rFCoV-I or rFCoV-II at different MOI values. cell pellets from different post-infection times were lysed for Western blotting analysis. each membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody. two sera from specific pathogen-free cats were used as negative-control sera. serotype of each FCoV infection was identified based on rFCoV-I- or rFCoV-II-infected Sf-9 cells (rRBD-1 and rRBD-II) plasma samples from FIP confirmed animals were examined by both NT test and the type-specific IFA. clinically healthy cats collected from 26 veterinary hospitals in 6 cities in 6 cities in Taiwan over 8 years were enrolled in this study. the overall prevalence of FCoV in Taiwan was 34.5% (287/833). amplification and expression of the type-specific S region of type I and type II FCoV were identified. boxed nucleotides represent N-linked glycosylation sites. the boxed nucleotides represent N-linked glycosylation sites. the specificity of the type-specific IFA was verified using plasma samples from the confirmed type I or II FCoV-infected cats or from SPF cats. the plasma from type I FCoV-infected cats could specifically react with rRBD-I, but not with rRBD-II. NT titer b Typing I (specimen) Typing II (specimen) FIP-1 As I (400) 10 FIP-2 As I (800) 10 FIP-3 As I (800) 10 FIP-4 As I (800) FIP-5 B, R I (1600) FIP-6 Lu I (400) FIP-7 B, R I (800) 10 FIP-8 R I (800) FIP-9 B I (800) 10 FIP-13 R I (400) infection with serotype I FCoV appeared to be dominant in both the FIP and the non-FIP groups. plasma samples from type I or II FCoV-infected cats with type I FIP were analyzed. 78.1% (25/32) had antibodies against r-RBD-I. 9.4% (3/32) were positive for antibodies against both types. 84.6% (22/26) possessed antibodies against type I FCoV. a novel type-specific IFA was established to express the protein fragment antigenically distinct between type I and II FCoV. the expressed regions were located from amino acids no. 523 to no. 692 and no. 508 to no. 678 of the S proteins. the amino acid sequences of the putative RBD of S protein from type I and type I FCoV were confirmed by Western blotting using an anti-histidine mAb. the specificity of the type-specific IFA was verified using plasma samples from the confirmed cat or cat. both recombinant proteins could be detected by the anti-histidine mAb. the plasma from type I FCoV-infected cats could specifically react with rRBD-I, but not with rRBD-II, and vice versa. NT titer b Typing I (specimen) Typing II (specimen) FIP-1 As I (400) 10 FIP-3 As I (800) 10 FIP-4 As I (800) FIP-5 B, R I (1600) FIP-6 Lu I (400) FIP-7 B, R I (800) 10 FIP-8 R I (800) FIP-9 B I (800) FIP-10 R I (400) FIP-11 Pl I (400) 10 F serotype I FCoV appeared to be dominant in both the FIP and the non-FIP groups. infection with serotype I FCoV appeared to be dominant in most cases. three plasma samples from healthy cats with type II FCoV detected in fecal samples were used for serotyping. all three samples were FCoV seropositive, but only one was identified as infected by both types of FCoV. baculovirus-expressed, truncated SARS-CoV S protein-based IFAs were found to be highly sensitive and specific compared with conventional whole virus-based IFAs. prevalence of FCoV in field cats varies among countries, e.g., 50% in Switzerland [10], 34% in Australia [23], 22% in Japan [11] and 13.7% in Korea [24]. a relatively high antibody titer against type II virus may also result from other alphacoronaviruses. a competitive ELISA was used to discriminate the serotype of infection. in another IFA study, 23% of cats displayed equal titers against type I and II FCoV. three cats with type II FIP possessed antibodies solely against type II FCoV. this finding matches the recombination theory that states that type II FCoV arises from the mutation of type I FCoV. 84.6% of the cats in the current study possessed anti-FCoV antibodies that could not be serotyped. the infection of serotype II FCoV correlated significantly with the occurrence of FIP [16]. horizontal transmission of a serotype II virus was clearly demonstrated to be responsible for a FIP outbreak. we acknowledge Prof. Ching-Ho Wang from national Taiwan University for providing the vectors and the technical assistance of Yung-Hui Chang."}
