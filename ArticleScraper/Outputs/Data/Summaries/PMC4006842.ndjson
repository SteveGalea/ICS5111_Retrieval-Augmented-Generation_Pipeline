{"summary": "health care services for asthma and ambient air pollution data were obtained from the national health insurance research database and environmental protection administration from 2000 through 2009. results The number of asthma-patient visits to health-care facilities continues to increase in Taiwan. asthma is a common chronic inflammatory respiratory disease that affects 300 million people of all ages and all ethnic backgrounds. the prevalence of asthma increased from 5.07% in 1985 to 11.9% in 2007 [2], [3], [3]. air pollution episodes lead to respiratory irritation, increased use of asthma medications and hospitalizations. the NHRI randomly sampled a representative database of one million subjects enrolled in the national health insurance program in the year 2005. this one-million sample was validated to be representative of the entire insured population. the identification numbers and personal information of all individuals in the NHRID were erased to protect the privacy of the individuals. data from background and industrial air quality monitoring stations were excluded to avoid extreme levels of air pollutants. complete monitoring data for the air pollutants included PM10, SO2, CO, O3, and NO2. subjects enrolled in the national health insurance program in 2005 by a systematic sampling method. this one-million sample was validated to be representative of the entire insured population. daily counts of clinic visits, outpatient visits, ED visits and hospital admissions for asthma were extracted from the medical insurance file. data from 54 air quality monitoring stations were enrolled. total monitoring data included PM10, SO2, CO, O3, and NO2. the average seasonal concentration of each air pollutant was calculated for further analysis from 2000 to 2009. peak seasons for asthma inpatient and outpatient visits in Taiwan were spring (5.1/10,000 person-season) and winter (149.6/10,000 person-season), respectively. peak seasons for asthma inpatient and outpatient visits in Taiwan were spring (5.1/10,000 person-season) and winter (149.6/10,000 person-season), respectively. the adjusted RRs of outpatient health service use were 1.10 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.16; P-trend = 0.013) for CO, 1.10 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.18; P-trend = 0.015) for NO2, 0.94 (95% CI: 0.88, 0.99; P-trend = 0.016) for O3, and 1.20 (95% CI:1.13, 1.27; P-trend = 0.0001) for PM10 in the child group. patient visits were 1.13 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.23; P-trend = 0.078) for CO, 1.17 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.31; P-trend = 0.002) for NO2, 0.88 (95% CI: 0.83, 0.94; P-trend = 0.001) for O3, and 1.13 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.21; P-trend = 0.001) for PM10. 1.07\u20131.20 1.06 1.01\u20131.12 1.02 0.97\u20131.06 0.55\u20130.69 1.06 1.01\u20131.12 1.12 1.03\u20131.21 1.11 1.04\u20131.20 1.02 0.96\u20131.09 0.69\u20131.22 1.10 1.04\u20131.16 1.13 1.03\u20131.23 1.15 1.05\u20131.26 1.04 0.95\u20131.13 P-Trend 0.013 0.078 0.003 0.450 NO2 (ppm) 4.45\u201314.01 the adjusted RRs for the child inpatient visits across quartiles of CO level were 1.00, 1.70, 1.92, and 1.86 (P-trend = 0.0001). there were no significant linear associations between inpatient visits and air pollutants in other age groups. 1.86 1.67\u20132.07 0.98 0.83\u20131.16 0.82 0.66\u20131.01 1.14 0.96\u20131.34 Year 1.34 1.28\u20131.39 1.22 1.17\u20131.27 1.12 1.08\u20131.15 1.15 1.10\u20131.20 CO (ppm) 0.19\u20130.43 --- 0.43\u20130.55 1.70 1.40\u20132.06 1.08 0.83\u20131.40 1.17 0.98\u20131.66 0.55\u20130.69 1.92 1.53\u20132.40 1.07 0.81 in 2003, there was an outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Hong Kong and nearly became a pandemic event. in general, there were trends of increasing asthma outpatient visits. inpatient visits for asthma increased with increased levels of CO in children. inpatient visits for asthma increased with increased levels of CO in children. inpatient visits for asthma increased with increased levels of CO in children. there was no increased risk for inpatient visits for adults with increasing levels of air pollutants. there was an increase of inpatient and outpatient visits after the SARS outbreak. there were associations between short-term exposure to ambient CO and risk of cardiovascular disease hospitalizations. an increase in the interquartile range of the 5-day average for CO was associated with 48% increases in the risk of an asthma ED visit for children aged 2 to 4. in adult aged 15 to 44, the associations were less pronounced in adult aged 15 to 44. a direct association between CO and asthma lacks a biologically plausible mechanism. previous studies have not shown a significant effect of SO2 on asthma hospitalization rates. most previous studies have not shown a significant effect of SO2 on asthma hospitalization rates. the data were obtained from a historical database, which collects all information. we analyzed levels of pollutants at different municipalities. this study directly associated the patient visits with levels of pollutants in those municipalities."}
