{"summary": "a transmission network score (TNS) was developed to estimate the risk of HIV transmission from a newly diagnosed individual to a new partner and target prevention interventions. a high TNS (top 25%) was significantly correlated with baseline risk behaviors and predicted risk of transmission. the high evolutionary rate of HIV-1 gives rise to an essentially unique HIV-1 genetic sequence for each infected individual. the data necessary to perform such molecular analyses are often readily available and central in commercial laboratories. molecular epidemiology has the potential to identify individuals most likely to transmit infection. HIV-1 risk behaviors (computer assisted self-interviews), blood viral load (Amplicor, Roche) and CD4 count (flow cytometry) were obtained at baseline and every 12 weeks throughout follow-up. all participants were assessed for baseline HIV-1 transmitted drug resistance via bulk sequencing of the partial HIV-1 pol coding region. the degree (connectivity) [20] of each individual was defined as the number of links (edges in the transmission network) to other individuals. clusters were defined as connected components of the network comprising two or more nodes. nodes are connected with an edge if the minimum distance between the respective pol sequences is less than 1.5%. a direction is assigned to an edge if the EDI for the secondary partner (i.e., putative \u201crecipient\u201d) is at least 30 days after the sampling date of the putative transmitting partner. we examined associations between the calculated TNS and baseline characteristics, including viral load (VL), CD4 count, risk behaviors (number or sex partners and unprotected anal intercourse [UAI]), stage of infection and demographics. we also tested whether nodes with higher TNS were associated with a greater risk of participating in putative transmissions (i.e., out-edges) between baseline and year 1. ART is 100% effective at stopping all secondary transmissions. other nodes are colored according to how likely they are to be prevented from becoming infected assuming that we have removed the treated nodes from the infectious pool. they are labeled by the rate at which they are expected to be effectively protected. study population HIV-1 screening was offered to adults and adolescents between 1996 and 2011 at multiple HIV-1 testing and counseling sites in San Diego, California. all HIV-1-positive individuals were offered study participation with confidential partner services. all participants were assessed for baseline HIV-1 transmitted drug resistance via bulk sequencing of the partial HIV-1 pol coding region. the sequenced region included the protease gene and between 305 and 335 5\u2032 amino-acids of the reverse transcriptase gene. inferred transmission network (excluding unconnected individuals) in the SDPIC. only clustered individuals (nodes) within the network are shown (52.3%). a partial HIV-1 transmission network is color coded. a direction is assigned to an edge if the EDI for the secondary partner is at least 30 days after the sampling date of the putative transmitting partner (i.e., putative \u201csource\u201d) the direction of transmission was resolved for in 332 of the 540 individuals (61.5%). we also tested whether nodes with higher TNS were associated with a greater risk of participating in putative transmissions between baseline and year 1. the TNS values were neither shared with study participants, nor generated in real time to influence clinical decision-making. panel A and panel B networks have the same topology, though the appearance is slightly different to allow labeling of specific nodes. the association between high TNS and patient characteristics, transmission risks, and clinical and epidemiological factors was tested using Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test for continuous characteristics. p0.10 variables were statistically important (p0.10) at the univariate level and then removing them using backward elimination. goodness of fit of the final model was assessed with the likelihood ratio test. n (%) 155 (48.1) 63 (44.7) 218 (47.1) Non-Hispanic black, n (%) 14 (4.4) 22 (15.6) 36 (7.8) Hispanic, n (%) 122 (37.9) 42 (29.8) 164 (35.4) Other, n (%) 31 (9.6) 14 (9.9) 45 (9.7) Risk Factors for HIV MSM, n = 590, n (%) 444 (97.2) 125 (94.0) 1500 copies/mL, n (%) 27 (5.7) 38 (27.5) 65 (10.6) 1501\u2013,000 copies/mL, n (%) 63 (13.2) 24 (17.4) 87 (14.1) 10,001\u2013100,000 copies/mL, n (%) 143 (29.9) 46 (33.3) 189 (30.7) >100,000 copies/mL, n (%) 245 (51.3) 30 (21.7) 275 (44.6) participants enrolled during acute and early infection were not significantly more likely to develop a new outbound edge within the first year of follow up than persons with established (i.e., chronic) infection. participants with high TNS were significantly more likely to have a putative transmission event within the first year, defined as one or more acquired outbound network connections in the first year. white participants (29.3%) were significantly more likely than Hispanics (11.1%) or participants of other race(s) (5.9%) to experience a putative transmission event (p = 0.02) there were no significant associations between baseline CD4 count (p = 0.53), insertive (p = 0.50) or receptive UAI (p = 0.34), age (p = 0.79), or stage of infection (p = 0.50) and putative transmission events. 3.0 1.5 p = 0.03 OR = 1.8, P = 0.03 UAI, receptive Any 76.0% 64.8% p = 0.34 None 24.0% 35.2% UAI, insertive Any 69.2% 60.4% p = 0.50 None 30.8% 39.6% Race White 75.9% 50.4% p = 0.02 Hispanic 20.7% 28.1% Other 3.5% 21.5% Stage of infection Acute/Early 72.1% 64.1% a total of 177 out of 339 (52.2%) clustered participants initiated ART at a median of 168 days from study entry.

ART initiation within 12 weeks of EDI resulted in significantly less putative transmission (i.e. fewer out- and undirected- connections) than when ART was started later (p0.05). the ratio of the median number of prevented infections between TNS and randomly delivered ART. the proportion of randomly targeted ART interventions that prevented fewer infections than TNS-targeted ART. TNS provides a new method to estimating transmission risk within a network. this method could be extended to infer regional transmission networks from the extensive archives of HIV sequence data stored in commercial databases. the score could be readily utilized in clinical practice as patient level TNS results could be integrated into routine genotype test reports. the inferred transmission network is incomplete and inaccurate. there are limitations to the interpretation of these results. the presence of a directed link between two individuals does not guarantee an HIV transmission event occurred. a network based study in San Diego, California corroborated previous findings that higher VL was associated with transmission risk [31] and that early ART decreased this risk [26]. prevention efforts targeted to these individuals may be better use of prevention resources than random implementation or targeting individuals with higher number of sexual partners."}
