{"summary": "medical imaging is a key field in healthcare engineering, which aims to help medical professionals identify lesions and diseases. early attempts at computerized analysis of medical images were made in the 1960s, such as diagnosis of primary bone tumor [1] and detection of abnormalities in mammograms [2]. CAD systems are employed in the early detection of pathologies, that is, to obtain a \u201csecond opinion\u201d and help them make the final decision. some authors have proposed CAD systems capable of recognizing diseases such as polyps in the colon [20], acute intracranial haemorrhage [21], and severe respiratory syndrome [22]. some authors are also investigating how to segment the bony structures of the chest [27, 28], often to eliminate the shadows projected on the lung parenchyma. a sample of 48 high resolution DICOM images of chest radiographs was provided by the HGURSM to perform tests. the images have a resolution of 3000 3000 pixels and a depth of 12 bits per pixel. in the available images, there are 25 normal (12 males and 13 females) and 23 pathologic (13 males and 10 females) samples. template matching algorithm consists in searching for a given template in all possible locations of an image, applying a predefined similarity measure for each location. different patterns of lungs are used to cope with the variety of aspects they can adopt due to sex, age, or individuals. n = 0 7 2 n t I x, y I neigh n, x, y, with t v = 0, v 0 1, v 0, (1) where neigh iterates the neighbors of pixel (x, y 1), (x, y 1), (x + 1, y 1), (x, y + 1), (x, y + 1), (x, y + 1), (x, y + 1), ( the input radiography is divided into a grid of 3 4 regions for both lungs. the LBP histogram of each region is obtained, producing a feature vector of 24 histograms of 256 bins. the system calculates for each region R in image I: v R = min o normal d H R I, H R T o min p pathologic d H R I, H R T p, (4). the values v(R) can be interpreted as votes to either normality or pathology; otherwise, it is classified as pathologic. the class with the most votes provides the final classification for I. CV takes the sum v(1) + v(2)++v(24) if the sum is positive, image I is considered as pathologic and otherwise normal. the template matching algorithm [35] is a well-known technique in computer vision. it consists in searching for a given template in all possible locations of an image, applying a predefined similarity measure for each location. different patterns of lungs are used to cope with the variety of aspects they can adopt due to sex, age, or individuals. n = 0 7 2 n t I x, y I neigh n, x, y, with t v = 0, v 0 1, v 0, (1) where neigh iterates the neighbors of pixel (x, y 1), (x, y 1), (x + 1, y 1), (x, y + 1), (x, y + 1), (x, y + 1), (x, y + 1), ( the input radiography is divided into a grid of 3 4 regions for both lungs. the LBP histogram of each region is obtained, producing a feature vector of 24 histograms of 256 bins. the system calculates for each region R in image I: v R = min o normal d H R I, H R T o min p pathologic d H R I, H R T p, (4). the values v(R) can be interpreted as votes to either normality or pathology; otherwise, it is classified as pathologic. the class with the most votes provides the final classification for I. CV takes the sum v(1) + v(2)++v(24) if the sum is positive, image I is considered as pathologic and otherwise normal. this threshold determines the compromise between false positive and false negative errors. ifier is defined as the number of correctly classified images. results are indicated for males, females, and using all individuals. best result for each classifier is marked in bold. in CV, the optimum threshold appears to be near 0, as it would be expected. the best result is obtained with CV method, giving 87% of correct classifications. the best result is obtained with DV with discrimination matrix. results of the hypothesis testing on the GDAV, DV, and CV classifiers are presented in Table 1. results are indicated for males, females, and using all individuals. nr represents the number of existing radiographs in the training set. the expected error rate of a completely random classifier would be 50%. some classifiers in Table 1 produce better results with the complete set. hypotheses are proposed in this subsection: (H0) Null Hypothesis. the classifiers GDAV, DV, and CV are equally effective. the classifiers GDAV, DV, and CV are equally effective. a new approach for detecting normality/pathology in chest radiographies has been presented. our method is based on LBP as a simple but powerful texture descriptor. different combination schemes have been compared and a statistical analysis has found that in some cases there is a significant difference among them."}
