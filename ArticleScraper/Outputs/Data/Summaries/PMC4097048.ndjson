{"summary": "the temporal scan statistic identified significant MRSA clusters at the hospital (n = 2), service (n = 16), and ward (n = 10) levels (P 0.05). seven clusters were concordant with nine MRSA outbreaks identified by hospital staff. temporal scan statistic is a valuable tool for healthcare workers to evaluate surveillance strategies and aid in the identification of MRSA clusters. detection of transmission events and outbreaks is based on limited evidence [1], and detection of specific pathogen clusters is generally subjective in nature [2]. in hospitals, the incorporation of the scan statistic for the detection of MRSA disease clusters, spatially and/or temporally, has been limited. in one study, a space-time permutation scan statistic was used to detect clusters throughout the hospital. in another investigation, a temporal scan statistic was employed to identify MRSA clusters. at the time of hospital admission, patients identified as having an increased risk for MRSA acquisition are screened. these risk factors include [14]: previous colonization or infection with MRSA; time spent in any healthcare facility in the previous twelve months; or recent exposure to a unit/ward/area. per admission-discharge period was defined as the time interval from when a patient was admitted to the hospital. transfer to another ward within the hospital was not considered a discharge. data from the first bacteriology report per patient per admission-discharge period were obtained. data collected from the bacteriology report included a unique patient identifier, dates pertaining to patient admission, discharge, and when a specimen was collected for MRSA testing. bacteriology reports provided both service and ward designations. wards were characterized as specific, physically distinct units that comprised a service. colonies identified as S. aureus by Gram stain, catalase test, tube coagulase test, and the S. aureus latex agglutination assay. presence of methicillin-resistance was confirmed by the penicillin-binding protein 2a latex agglutination test. spa types were compared to epidemic MRSA strains that are frequently found in Canada [19] Statistical analysis All bacteriology reports were provided by the hospital in electronic format. for all hypothesis tests, a 5% significance level was applied ( 0.05), if not stated otherwise. a Poisson regression analysis was conducted for the independent variables year, month, and season. wise modeling was applied to fit a multivariable multilevel Poisson model to all previously identified significant co-variables. a variable was considered to be a confounder if it changed the model coefficients by 20% [23]. interaction terms were examined for all independent variables. a cluster was defined as a period where the rate of MRSA cases was statistically higher than expected inside a window compared to outside a window. for 2006, the time interval was restricted to august 1st \u2013 December 31st and for 2011 the time interval was limited to January 1st \u2013 February 28th. this study was approved by the research ethics boards of the university of. Guelph and the participating hospital. the research ethics approval covered all aspects of the study including the collection of de-identified isolates from the. microbiology laboratory. patients that were identified as being either infected or colonized with MRSA were included in the analyses. only one MRSA isolation event per patient per admission-discharge period was included in the analyses. tests were performed using Vitek\u00ae 2 for surveillance and clinical MRSA isolates. only one MRSA isolate per patient was collected for molecular typing. Molecular typing Patient isolates were obtained from the hospital\u2019s microbiology laboratory following MRSA confirmation. the presence of methicillin-resistance was confirmed by the penicillin-binding protein 2a latex agglutination test. all MRSA isolates were investigated for the lukF-PV gene encoding the Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) toxin by real-time PCR. a minimum spanning tree (MST) was constructed using the default distance bin size of 100%. only spa types that differed by 2 repeats were closely related. Variables with a correlation above 0.8 were investigated for collinearity. the biologically more plausible variable was retained in the model. a variable was considered a confounder if it changed the model coefficients by 20%. period covered by the scanning window is proportional to its population size. window identified as least likely due to chance, is subsequently evaluated by a maximum likelihood test with a test decision based on a Monte-Carlo simulated P-value. a total of 642 (93.6%) patients were identified with MRSA during one hospital admission-discharge period. 44 (6.4%) patients were identified with MRSA during two or more hospital admission-discharge periods. the monthly incidence rate of MRSA fluctuated over the study period. occus aureus infections and colonization per month in a community hospital. from march 1, 2010 to February 28, 2011, 267 MRSA cases were identified and 167 (62.5%) patient isolates were obtained for spa typing. spa types were classified as CMRSA-2. only one spa type, 93/t026, was classified as CMRSA-1. all isolates were negative for the PVL toxin gene. antimicrobial susceptibility profiles were identical between spa types. for spa types 23/t548, 93/t026, 268/t067 and 387/t653, the antimicrobial susceptibility profiles were identical between spa types. years 2009\u20132011 had MRSA rates that were significantly higher than the MRSA rates in 2006. results from model-based contrasts indicate that years 2009\u20132011 also had significantly higher MRSA rates than years 2007 and 2008.
