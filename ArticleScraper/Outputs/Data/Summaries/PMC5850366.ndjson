{"summary": "fidelity of viral RNA genome replication is an estimation of the frequency of non-Watson-Crick base pairs formed during RNA chain growth driven by RNA polymerases. fidelity of viral RNA genome replication refers to the appearance of non-Watson-Crick base pairs during viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)-mediated RNA chain growth. viral RNA genome replication is best viewed as a process during which a population of interacting or inter-dependent genomes is synthesized. a too faithful a synthesis would fail to generate adaptable genomes; a too error-prone an RNA synthesis would lead to a viral population from which no viable genomes would be selected. tis C virus (HCV, Flaviviridae, Hepacivirus) showed a mutation rate of 3.5 106 s/n/c. these values correspond to mutation rates per genome and replication of 1.14, 0.59, 0.36, and 0.01, respectively. measuring fidelity at the RdRp level relies on biochemical assays of recombinant proteins. a clear comparative set is not available for flaviviruses yet. there are almost no data for flaviviruses yet. chemists have proposed ribose modifications to trick viral polymerases. the fidelity of viral RNA polymerases is achieved has implications on our understanding of viral mutagenesis and evolution. in some cases, NAs may slow or impede synthesis without truly stalling the RdRp, thus combining both effects described above. initiation is a distributive polymerization reaction, i.e., the enzyme dissociates frequently from the template. the next phase consists in a processive RNA synthesis reaction, called \u201celongation\u201d. step 2 should influence the efficiency of step 3, the nucleotide or analogue incorporation, which is important for fidelity especially for the interference of correction mechanisms. a mismatch in the RdRp active site is expected to be significantly longer than that of a regular base. a mismatched 3\u2032-end nucleotide is excised by a pyrophosphorolysis-like reaction. a primer shorter by one nucleotide and the concomitant production of a nucleoside tetraphosphate NppppN. this repair mechanism turned out to be the main mechanism of resistance against the NA azidothymidine (AZT) mediated by the reverse transcriptase (RT) of HIV. site of viral RdRps is made of catalytic motifs with a conserved secondary structure, motifs A and C, and two aspartic acid residues common to all polymerases. another two motifs, B and D, are common to RNA-dependent polymerases. fidelity of viral RNA genome replication is the estimation of the frequency of mutations observed after one, or several, complete virus life cycles have occurred. infected cells, viral RdRps have evolved to perform RNA synthesis under fine-tuned conditions. they must synthesize a faithful copy of the viral RNA genome, yet they have to generate a defined amount of mutations per genome. a too faithful a synthesis would fail to generate adaptable genomes. a central value for the mutation rate per replicated genome was given as 0.76 substitutions per genome per replication. a central value for the mutation rate per replicated genome for RNA viruses was given as 0.76 substitutions per genome per replication [12], and differences in RNA virus replication fidelity rates emerge. magnetic-tweezer experiments were developed to study nucleotide analogue incorporation at the single-molecule level. fidelity results of this enzymatic RdRp test correlated with deep-sequencing-based mutation frequencies obtained in infected cells. it is reasonable to expect that each Flavivirus RdRp has its own characteristic fidelity. chemists have proposed ribose modifications to trick viral polymerases. such NAs interfere with the RNA synthesis constitute the basis of current antiviral therapies against a variety of viruses [24,25]. nucleic acid polymerases create a phosphodiester bond between the 3\u2032-OH and the 5\u2032--phosphate of two nucleotides. the 5\u2032--phosphate belongs to a 5\u2032-triphosphate nucleotide, and receives a nucleophilic attack from either the 3\u2032-OH of a single nucleotide or that of a short oligonucleotide primer or, in some cases, an -OH the current general model for de novo RNA synthesis by viral RdRp is best described with three distinct phases. the constants k+1 to k+5 and k1 to k5 represent the forward and backward kinetic constants of each individual reversible reaction. step 2 should influence the efficiency of step 3, the nucleotide or analogue incorporation. this reverse process represents de facto a correction mechanism operating to increase the overall nucleotide insertion fidelity. a mismatch produces a stalling of the RdRp, whereas a Watson-Crick nucleotide is immediately extended by the next correct nucleotide. the - and -phosphates of NTPs are, structurally, almost identical to a pyrophosphate molecule. a mismatched 3\u2032-end nucleotide is excised by a pyrophosphorolysis-like reaction. the pyrophosphate donor comes from an undefined NTP of the intracellular nucleotide pool. the active site of viral RdRps is made of catalytic motifs. flavivirus RdRps have evolved features that are usually accomplished by ancillary proteins in the eukaryotic cell. they synthesize their own primer at the precise 3\u2032-end of the (+) genomic and () anti-genomic viral RNA. the de novo RdRp function of flaviviruses is harbored in the C-terminal domain (RdRp domain 74 kDa) of protein NS5. ridae RdRps are notably of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV, genus Aphtovirus, [4]), PV [40] and enterovirus 71 (EV71) [41]. these movements are also visible by comparing other apo- or pre-catalytic complex structures with ternary complex structures in a catalytic state as for HCV RdRp (PDB ID: 2XI3 [42] versus complex structures (PD structure of the ZIKV RdRp domain (PDB ID: 5U0C) in ribbon representations above and surface representations below. back views are rotated by ca. 20\u00b0 to the right in relation to the representation in (A) in order to show the NTP entry. the MTase domain is localized near the NTP entry tunnel of the RdRp domain. the residues of both interfaces have been shown to be functionally relevant for viral replication. it is not yet clear during which step of RNA synthesis these interfaces are relevant. a strictly conserved His is the strongest candidate for forming a priming platform against which the first nucleotide stacks upon de novo initiation. the strict specificity for ATP as the priming nucleotide points to the existence of a specific ATP-binding site involving the priming loop. this site has not yet been characterized because of the lack of relevant binary or ternary complex structures of Flavivirus RdRps. the only published study of a stable, highly-processive elongation complex used the DENV2 RdRp domain [16]. the authors studied nucleotide discrimination (i.e., the ratio of the incorporation efficiency of correct GTP versus incorrect NTP) for HCV RdRp GTP discrimination was reported to be 14,500 to 1 for UTP, 450,000 to 1 for ATP and 42,000 to 1 for CTP. the first Flavivirus RdRp structure was determined in 2007 and was of the isolated RdRp domain of west Nile virus (WNV, PDB ID: 2XI3 [42]) the general features of the newly published structures of ZIKV RdRp (PDB ID: 5U0C) are illustrated in Figure 3A using the most complete of the recently published structures of ZIKV RdRp (PDB ID: 5U0C) structure of the ZIKV RdRp domain (PDB ID: 5U0C) in ribbon representations above and surface representations below are shown. back views are rotated by ca. 20\u00b0 to the right in relation to the representation in (A) in order to show the NTP entry, which is partially obstructed by the MTase domain. the RdRp domain in ZIKV NS5 (PDB ID: 5U0B) does not show major conformational changes compared to the isolated RdRp domain (PDB ID: 5U0C) there is a local change in the conformation of the NTP tunnel ceiling constituted by the ring finger. structure of a ternary complex enzyme:primer/template:nucleotide of HCV RdRp in the catalytic state [43] was obtained using an enzyme construct from which the corresponding priming loop had been deleted. this indicates that the loop clears off the exit RNA pathway without major distortion nor dysfunction of the RdRp active site. this change in enzyme behavior and properties is still very poorly characterized. the authors studied nucleotide discrimination by DENV2 RdRp. for HCV RdRp GTP discrimination was reported to be 14,500 to 1 for UTP, 450,000 to 1 for ATP and 42,000 to 1 for CTP. more studies are desirable but await stable and highly-processive elongation complexes of full-length Flavivirus NS5 with a primer/template [17,54,66]. a combined structure- and sequence-based alignment of the corresponding motifs A to G is placed. the motifs are sequentially presented in the accompanying movies. the motifs are sequentially presented in the accompanying movies. the alignment representation was generated using Jalview [71]. the secondary structure of ZIKV RdRp (PDB ID: 5U0C) is given above the sequence alignment. 123 sequences were recovered of which repeated sequences were removed. the next incoming nucleotide is first probed by base pairing. the final perfect alignment for reaction includes a movement of catalytic motif A towards the motif C completing a three-stranded -sheet. a side chain movement (\u201cout\u201d to \u201cin\u201d) of the catalytic aspartic acid located in motif A. the liberated pyrophosphate (PPi) is still present at the catalytic site. PV open corresponds to a complex after reaction and translocation. only the protein is shown. HCV closed, as in the left panel, superimposed to ZIKV RdRp (PDB ID: 5UOC, orchid), WNV RdRp (PDB ID: 2HFZ, grey), DENV3 NS5 (PDB ID: 4V0Q, light blue) and DENV3 NS5 (PDB ID: 5CCV, brown). a larger protein stretch than only motif D is shown including the helix before and the loop after motif D. all Flavivirus RdRp structures contain motif A in an open conformation. the three-stranded -sheet of motifs A and C is not formed. the fidelity gate for Flavivirus RdRps is the formation of the motif-C-motif-A -sheet.

P44S positioned after the index finger influences the conformation of the latter. the index finger in Enterovirus RdRps forms a binding pocket for the +2 template base opposite to motif G. the correct placement of template residues is expected to be associated with NTP or NTP analog recognition, alignment, and incorporation. s promote a slightly altered positioning of the primer/template RNA. the structure is made of two -strands connected by a short loop (Motif C) and a -strand followed by a short helix (Motif A) two aspartate residues coming from each motif are universally conserved in all polymerases. the movement of motif A includes the change of the side chain position of the second aspartic acid within the motif (movement \u201cin\u201d to \u201cout\u201d) leaving space for the 2\u2032OH group of the aligned NTP. the same kind of movement of motif A is observed for the de novo RdRp of HCV (apo structure PDB ID: 2XI2 [42] versus complex. HCV closed, as in the left panel, superimposed to ZIKV RdRp (PDB ID: 5UOC, orchid) and WNV RdRp (PDB ID: 2HFZ, grey) the Mg2+ ion belongs to the WNV RdRp structure. a conformational change of the loop and residue K359 is indicated by a black arrow. motif-D stretch of PV closed shown with template, product, and PPi. superimposed to ZIKV RdRp (PDB ID: 5UOC, orchid), WNV RdRp (PDB ID: 2HFZ, grey) and bacteriophage Q- RdRp (PDB ID: 3AVT, green) the pre-catalytic Mg2+ ions present in the WNV and EV71 RdRp structures seem to show two distinct positions for metal ion A on its way into the catalytic site. this suggests a movement of metal ion A from \u201cout\u201d to \u201cin\u201d which would contribute to the formation of the -sheet and the closure of the catalytic site. 238 Out B Loop in

positions of certain residues implicated in NTP probing, alignment, and catalysis. for the ZIKV RdRp structure 5U0C two chains, A and D, were considered, which show differences in motif B. the loop was observed to be highly flexible, especially in apo RdRp structures. a wide-range closing and opening movement is proposed to be involved in the translocation step after catalysis. the final adjustment of the loop after translocation seems to imply rather limited movements. a special conformation is adopted in the WNV RdRp (PDNB ID: 2HFZ) the loop might show a translocation conformation closing in towards template positions 1 and +1. another motif-B residue, conserved in Flavivirus RdRps as an Arg (R601 in ZIKV) corresponds to M296 of FMDV RdRp. motif-B S282T (corresponding to S603 ZIKV) provides a moderate resistance towards 2\u2032-modified nucleotides. the main resistance mutation is motif-B S282T (corresponding to S603 ZIKV), which provides a moderate resistance towards 2\u2032-modified nucleotides. motif B appears central for overall RNA synthesis fidelity. mutations in motif B could slow down translocation and increase the time of residency of a mismatch in the active site. this would have to be verified in the case of Flavivirus RdRps. tif D is the least conserved motif in positive-strand RNA virus RdRps. it starts after a conserved -helix and is largely made of structurally-diverse loops. a Lys is found at a similar place in various positive-strand RNA virus RdRps even in DNA polymerases. mutations in Enterovirus motif D have been reported to impact fidelity and provide viral mutator phenotypes. the authors propose that substitution alters the conformational equilibrium between open and closed states of PV RdRp. flavivirus RdRps show a signature xFCSxHx7DGRx4PCRx. the CSx18R is also found in flaviviridae RdRps. in the existing structures of BVDV RdRp motif E is localized near the priming loop. motif F of closed structures of PV RdRp (PDB ID: 3OL7) and HCV RdRp (PDB ID: 5WTA) are shown with superimposed Lys and Arg residues. only motif F is shown of HCV RdRp (HCV closed, see explanations in legend of Figure 5B,. the arrow indicates the significant flexibility of motif F in Flavivirus RdRps. only motifs G and F are shown of HCV RdRp. the end of the motif, which is present, adopts an alternative helical conformation. in DENV2 RdRp in complex with an inhibitor (PDB ID: 5K5M) motif F is also partially formed. the end does adopt, as expected from other RdRp structures, a conformation forming the ceiling of the NTP tunnel. residue R473 seems to be in place (with some side chain changes) to probe and align the -phosphate, but K470 is displaced in the full-length NS5 and also in the isolated RdRp domain structures of ZIKV and JEV RdRps. neither of these positions seems to reflect the position of the fingertip during catalysis but they may show intermediate conformations relevant for replication. motif-F mutant I176V in CVB3 RdRp shows slightly lower fidelity. motif-F mutant I176V in CVB3 RdRp shows slightly lower fidelity. corresponding V553I mutation in CoV MHV RdRp also show altered fidelity. motif F is displaced into the RNA template channel similar to chain D of ZIKV RdRp (not shown in Figure 6B right panel) in several isolated RdRp structures without electron density for motif F, motif G is also not resolved. motif G is present in one ZIKV RdRp structure (PDB ID: 5U0C), but in two different conformations. motif G guides the RNA template into the tunnel. mutations in motif G could change the orientation of template residues +2 and +1 and so alter NTP recognition. a high-fidelity EV71 RdRp variant with mutation L123F is situated just after motif G. two mutations in putative hinge positions of the priming loop of WNV RdRp, V793I and G806R corresponding to in ZIKV V790 and G803. the priming loop is remote from the active site and the nucleotide selection pocket made of motifs A, B, D, and F. ructural biology, molecular dynamics, and modeling techniques will probably play an important role in the understanding of results still challenging a sound interpretation. for example: how do subtle conformational changes induced by divalent metal-binding (Mg2+, Mn2+,...) distort the active site. how do amino acid changes remote from the active site transduce alterations of substrate selection though long-range interactions\""}
